health."},"77":{"dur":2,"text":"So here I have my\nlittle pictures,"},"79":{"dur":2,"text":"one on physical activity."},"82":{"dur":3,"text":"We also have some work in\nsmoking cessation, right

all the parts of\na project or an entity"},"121":{"dur":0,"text":"that you're building."},"122":{"dur":2,"text":"In this case, it's a\nmobile health intervention."},"124":{"dur":1,"text":"And you have to think,\nwhat are all the parts,"},"126":{"dur":2,"text":"so that you can\nthink of each part"},"128":{"dur":2,"text":"and then how to\noptimize that part."},"130":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that's what I'm\ngoing to go through first."},"132":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's going to\nall be very verbal,"},"134":{"dur":1,"text":"but I'm talking--\nbecause one needs"},"136":{"dur":3,"text":"to think about each one of\nthese parts to optimize them."},"139":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is adaptive\ninterventions."},"141":{"dur":3,"text":"Adaptive interventions--\nthat's a name of a design"},"145":{"dur":4,"text":"that mobile health interventions\nfit within that name."},"149":{"dur":2,"text":"And the idea is these\nare interventions,"},"152":{"dur":3,"text":"where you want to tailor the\nintervention to the person."},"155":{"dur":3,"text":"One thinks that there may be\nsystematic reasons why people"},"159":{"dur":2,"text":"respond differently,\nand to the extent"},"161":{"dur":2,"text":"that you can use those\nsystematic reasons"},"164":{"dur":3,"text":"to personalize treatment,\nyou'd like to do that."},"167":{"dur":2,"text":"And what I'm going to do is\nI'm going to show you an older"},"170":{"dur":2,"text":"example, and the reason\nwhy I'm showing this to you"},"172":{"dur":2,"text":"is-- it's very simple."},"175":{"dur":1,"text":"It doesn't involve\nmobile health,"},"177":{"dur":3,"text":"but it helps really\ncommunicate the ideas."},"181":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's, for me,\nvery interesting is"},"184":{"dur":2,"text":"that we in the mobile\nhealth field, we forget--"},"187":{"dur":3,"text":"in the health field in general--\nwe forget that a lot of what we"},"190":{"dur":3,"text":"do has a lot of relevance\nfor social problems"},"194":{"dur":2,"text":"and social programs."},"197":{"dur":2,"text":"And this really gets at that."},"199":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is an adapted\ndrug court program"},"202":{"dur":1,"text":"for drug abusing offenders."},"204":{"dur":1,"text":"So what happens is\nyou get arrested,"},"206":{"dur":3,"text":"and you're offered\nthe opportunity"},"209":{"dur":5,"text":"to bypass jail and go\ninto a drug court program,"},"215":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's what we're\ntalking about individuals"},"217":{"dur":1,"text":"who had that opportunity."},"219":{"dur":2,"text":"And what happens is these\nindividuals come in,"},"222":{"dur":5,"text":"and this is a study that\nwent on in Philly, actually."},"227":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was a consultant\non this study,"},"229":{"dur":2,"text":"and they wanted to develop an\nadaptive intervention, which"},"232":{"dur":2,"text":"they called the Adaptive\nDrug Court Program."},"234":{"dur":1,"text":"This is a big coup\nactually, because this"},"236":{"dur":2,"text":"is working with the judicial\nsystem, which is nontrivial."},"238":{"dur":2,"text":"AUDIENCE: Are

Yeah."},"245":{"dur":1,"text":"AUDIENCE: In a\nprogram like this,"},"247":{"dur":4,"text":"Mark had talked about your\nresearch receiving funds."},"251":{"dur":3,"text":"Is this funded by\na grant, or

Yeah."},"260":{"dur":0,"text":"Right."},"261":{"dur":1,"text":"This is a good question."},"262":{"dur":5,"text":"So he asked me, how do these\ntypes of projects get funded?"},"268":{"dur":2,"text":"And in the world I live\nin, for the most part,"},"270":{"dur":5,"text":"we're always interested\nin edgy kind of projects."},"276":{"dur":3,"text":"So they tend to be funded\nby NIH or foundations"},"279":{"dur":3,"text":"like the Ford Foundation\nor some other foundation."},"283":{"dur":4,"text":"Autism Speaks has funded some\nof our work, for example."},"288":{"dur":4,"text":"You also see work funded\nby industry as well."},"293":{"dur":1,"text":"Every now and then,\nlittle bitty bits"},"294":{"dur":1,"text":"will get funded\nby the university,"},"296":{"dur":2,"text":"but that's not really\nwhere the money is."},"298":{"dur":4,"text":"AUDIENCE: So it alleviates then\nthe court systems or taxpayers"},"303":{"dur":1,"text":"were paying for some of these."},"304":{"dur":0,"text":"SUSAN MURPHY: Oh yeah."},"305":{"dur":2,"text":"The taxpayers-- they were\npaying for it, but not"},"307":{"dur":1,"text":"through the judicial system."},"309":{"dur":1,"text":"It was via a\nresearch project that"},"311":{"dur":4,"text":"was funded by the National\nInstitutes of Health."},"316":{"dur":1,"text":"So the whole goal\nwas to figure out,"},"318":{"dur":3,"text":"can we produce a good program?"},"321":{"dur":1,"text":"So people were\nclassifying-- what you"},"323":{"dur":1,"text":"see is a decision tree here."},"324":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can think of most\nadaptive interventions as akin"},"327":{"dur":1,"text":"to decision trees."},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"People were classified\ninto low risk or high risk."},"331":{"dur":4,"text":"This is a diagnosis of\nantisocial personality disorder"},"336":{"dur":1,"text":"or formal drug abuse treatment."},"338":{"dur":1,"text":"They're brought

supervision."},"353":{"dur":1,"text":"Can you reduce that?"},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"And can you only step\nit up if you need to?"},"358":{"dur":3,"text":"Every month they're monitored,\nand at the end of each month,"},"362":{"dur":1,"text":"they could be doing well."},"364":{"dur":1,"text":"Everything's fine."},"365":{"dur":1,"text":"Or they might be non-compliant."},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"That means they're not following\nthe rules of the drug court"},"369":{"dur":0,"text":"program."},"370":{"dur":2,"text":"They're not showing up to\nenough drug abuse sessions--"},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"two or more-- or they're\nnot providing urine screens"},"376":{"dur":2,"text":"every week."},"378":{"dur":2,"text":"If they're non-compliant,\nthe judicial supervision"},"380":{"dur":3,"text":"is stepped up at the\nend of that month."},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"If they're doing\nwell, nothing happens."},"386":{"dur":1,"text":"They just stay in\nthe same thing."},"387":{"dur":1,"text":"If they're\nnon-responsive, that's"},"389":{"dur":1,"text":"someone who's\nreally trying hard,"},"391":{"dur":4,"text":"but they're providing positive\nurine screens-- more than two."},"395":{"dur":3,"text":"And then you don't want to\nup the judicial supervision."},"399":{"dur":4,"text":"Instead, you want to increase\nthe support for drug abuse"},"403":{"dur":0,"text":"therapy."},"404":{"dur":2,"text":"And so they move to what's\ncalled intensive case"},"406":{"dur":0,"text":"management."},"407":{"dur":4,"text":"This includes\nindividual-based therapy"},"411":{"dur":2,"text":"and a lot of different\nsupportive services."},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"The whole goal of\nthis project was"},"416":{"dur":4,"text":"to help people graduate\nfrom the drug program, as"},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"opposed to going back\ninto jail, which is"},"423":{"dur":1,"text":"a very expensive intervention."},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is an\nadaptive intervention,"},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"and it has these\nelements that one really"},"432":{"dur":2,"text":"needs to think about when\nyou think about forming"},"435":{"dur":1,"text":"one of these interventions."},"436":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's always some\nsort of distal outcome."},"438":{"dur":3,"text":"In this case, it was\nhelping people graduate"},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"from the drug abuse program."},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"You can imagine\nin other settings,"},"446":{"dur":3,"text":"that distal outcome might\nbe a tradeoff between cost"},"449":{"dur":3,"text":"and benefit."},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"There's always a\nproximal response here."},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"In our case, the proximal\nresponse was whether or not"},"457":{"dur":3,"text":"you were compliant each\nmonth, or you were responsive,"},"461":{"dur":3,"text":"whether or not you\nhave positive urines."},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's what we're\nlooking-- we're"},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"looking to see how you're\nresponding, compliance."},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"You're responsive."},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"And then the decision\ntree is formed"},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"by what people in this field\ncall tailoring variables."},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"Those are the variables\nwe use to make decisions."},"478":{"dur":1,"text":"In our case, they\nare, in fact, the same"},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"as the proximal response."},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"The decision rules, which\nis that little decision"},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"tree, kinds of treatments\nwe have-- We're ready."},"487":{"dur":3,"text":"We're able to provide levels\nof judicial supervision, levels"},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"of drug abuse therapy."},"493":{"dur":1,"text":"And then you trigger--\nyou have to think"},"495":{"dur":3,"text":"about when you're going to\ntrigger the decision rules."},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"And in a drug abuse\nprogram, it was monthly,"},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"so at very coarse\nintervals in time."},"505":{"dur":4,"text":"And all of this has to be\nthought carefully about if you"},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"want to get something that's\nboth cost-effective and"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"effective."},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's go to a more\nof a mobile setting."},"518":{"dur":5,"text":"So here, people call these just\nin time adaptive interventions"},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"to communicate the\nfact that you're"},"527":{"dur":3,"text":"trying to intervene at the\ntime, in the moment, where"},"531":{"dur":5,"text":"a person really can use help\nat 2:00 AM in the stairwell,"},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"delivered when needed,\nwherever needed."},"540":{"dur":4,"text":"So here's a really simple\nexample that I like."},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"It's highly simplistic."},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"Nowadays things have gotten\nmuch more sophisticated,"},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"and this is where you\nhave software that's"},"552":{"dur":4,"text":"monitoring your mouse activity,\nas well as your keyboard"},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"activity on the computer."},"559":{"dur":1,"text":"You're an office worker."},"560":{"dur":4,"text":"And if you go 30 minutes\nwith uninterrupted activity,"},"565":{"dur":3,"text":"you get a ping, and it suggests\nthat you stand up and walk"},"568":{"dur":0,"text":"around the room."},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"Actually, there's a variety of\ndifferent kinds of messages,"},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"and they had the messages\ncompete with each other"},"574":{"dur":3,"text":"to see which one would be\nbest for you in what setting."},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're going to be talking\nabout this in the mobile health"},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"This is not mobile,\nbut it is just in time."},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"It has that connotation."},"587":{"dur":3,"text":"So what's common about\nadaptive interventions"},"590":{"dur":3,"text":"and these just in time\nadaptive interventions"},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"is they're time\nvarying treatments."},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"You see treatments\nchanging over time."},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"The idea is you're going\nto adapt the treatment"},"600":{"dur":0,"text":"to the individual."},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"You're going to personalize\ntreatment in some way."},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"However, in our just\nin time intervention,"},"608":{"dur":1,"text":"it's technology-based."},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"It's really focused,\nand, indeed, often,"},"612":{"dur":3,"text":"you'd want access to wearable\nsensor streams and so on."},"615":{"dur":4,"text":"You want to be able\nto collect information"},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"wherever it's needed so that you\nget the right kind of tailoring"},"622":{"dur":1,"text":"variable, so you\nknow what to do."},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"You know you can identify\nmoments of opportunity,"},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"moments of risk."},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"And you want to be able\nto deliver interventions"},"630":{"dur":3,"text":"in the real life of the person."},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's the exact\nsame game as before."},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"The components are\nthe exact same."},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"There's nothing\nspectacularly new here."},"641":{"dur":3,"text":"It's just that everything\nbecomes more in the moment."},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"At first, I used\nto say momentary,"},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"but I don't want to\ngive you the impression"},"651":{"dur":3,"text":"that the effects\nmight be fleeting."},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"But they're in\nthe moment, so I'm"},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"trying to help you with\nyour craving right now."},"659":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm trying to help you\nbe active right now."},"663":{"dur":1,"text":"And the decision\npoints are real time."},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"And what I'm going to do on\nthe next couple of slides"},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"is I'm going to go\nthrough each one of these,"},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"and it turns out\nright now, the state"},"671":{"dur":4,"text":"of the field in mobile\nhealth-- it's pretty immature."},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"And this makes it really\nexciting for scientists"},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"and technology developers,\nbecause most of this,"},"682":{"dur":3,"text":"we don't have good--\nwe don't really"},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"know how to optimize yet."},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"We know that we got problems."},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"We know where we need to go, but\nwe haven't gotten it straight"},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"in our head how to optimize it."},"694":{"dur":4,"text":"So we're going to start\noff by the distal outcome."},"698":{"dur":3,"text":"So the distal outcome\nis some long term goal"},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"that you want to achieve."},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"And in the world\nI live in, which"},"706":{"dur":3,"text":"is more on the research,\nmore research side,"},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"it usually is some sort\nof clinical outcome"},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"like I'm trying\nto delay the time"},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"to relapse in substance use."},"717":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm trying to reduce the rate\nat which people binge eat."},"721":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm trying to keep people\nfrom drinking heavily,"},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"binge drinking, and so on."},"728":{"dur":3,"text":"And a lot of areas maintain\nadherence to medications."},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"It's very common."},"733":{"dur":4,"text":"The whole idea here is you\nformulate your intervention"},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"options, the interventions\nthat you might provide"},"741":{"dur":3,"text":"so that you'll affect\nthese proximal responses,"},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"and thus achieve\nyour distal outcome."},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"So in the behavioral\nscience world,"},"750":{"dur":5,"text":"this fits in very well\nwith the way the theories"},"755":{"dur":1,"text":"with which they\nguide their thinking."},"760":{"dur":3,"text":"So proximal responses--\nthey're often called mediators."},"763":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't know if\nyou all would have"},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"heard those words, mediators."},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"They're used a lot in\nthe behavioral sciences,"},"770":{"dur":5,"text":"and if you think of A causes\nB, and then B causes C,"},"775":{"dur":1,"text":"B is the mediator."},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"A doesn't cause C directly."},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"It causes B, and\nthen B causes C."},"782":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's this causal chain\nthat you want to impact."},"785":{"dur":1,"text":"So here, I've\ngiven some examples"},"787":{"dur":1,"text":"of what the proximal\nresponse might"},"789":{"dur":3,"text":"be-- substance use\nover the near time,"},"792":{"dur":4,"text":"if you're interested in reducing\nrelapse, a physical activity,"},"797":{"dur":5,"text":"if you're trying to help people\nwho want to be less obese,"},"802":{"dur":3,"text":"medication adherence\nover the next time."},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is the same as the\nshort term targeted behavior."},"808":{"dur":1,"text":"The distal outcome\nis a behavior."},"810":{"dur":2,"text":"The proximal response\nis a behavior."},"813":{"dur":4,"text":"In other settings, it's some\nmeasure of short-term risk."},"817":{"dur":3,"text":"So for example, in\nsmoking cessation,"},"821":{"dur":3,"text":"one of the big determinants\nof why people tend to relapse"},"824":{"dur":2,"text":"is having problems\nwith stress management,"},"827":{"dur":2,"text":"because smoking is used\nto help you manage stress."},"830":{"dur":3,"text":"And so stress would be a\nclassical kind of mediator"},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"that you might want to impact."},"836":{"dur":1,"text":"And the last one--\nthis is something"},"838":{"dur":2,"text":"that we end up in the\nmobile health field,"},"841":{"dur":4,"text":"we're really starting to realize\nhow absolutely critical it is."},"846":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think someone\nin business would've"},"849":{"dur":4,"text":"realized this maybe even\nearlier-- is engagement."},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you're dealing\nwith a problem, which"},"855":{"dur":3,"text":"is chronic like, for\nexample, substance use,"},"859":{"dur":4,"text":"being physically active, eating\nwell, managing your stress,"},"863":{"dur":1,"text":"this is something\nyou have to deal"},"865":{"dur":2,"text":"with for long periods of time."},"867":{"dur":2,"text":"If we don't keep\nyou engaged, when"},"869":{"dur":1,"text":"things start to go\ndownhill, that app"},"871":{"dur":1,"text":"will not be there for you."},"873":{"dur":6,"text":"So engagement could be another\ntype of proximal response."},"879":{"dur":2,"text":"The kinds of intervention\noptions-- this,"},"882":{"dur":3,"text":"too, is very-- it's\nquite interesting."},"885":{"dur":1,"text":"I didn't realize\nthere were so many,"},"886":{"dur":3,"text":"but it's a vast array of\ndifferent kinds of ways"},"889":{"dur":3,"text":"that we can try and\nhelp people, ways"},"893":{"dur":3,"text":"to reframe a relapse,\nalternative activities"},"896":{"dur":3,"text":"to help me deal with\ncraving for a cigarette."},"900":{"dur":3,"text":"Maybe there's different\ninterventions,"},"903":{"dur":2,"text":"little interventions\nthat are on the phone,"},"906":{"dur":2,"text":"residing on my\nsmartphone, yet I don't"},"909":{"dur":1,"text":"I think when I\nshould access them,"},"911":{"dur":2,"text":"because I'm not so self-aware."},"913":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm so stressed out."},"914":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not that aware right now."},"916":{"dur":2,"text":"So it might be a nudge\nto access an intervention"},"919":{"dur":3,"text":"that I can obtain on the phone."},"922":{"dur":3,"text":"Self-monitoring-- prompt me\nto record my diet or something"},"926":{"dur":1,"text":"at that time."},"927":{"dur":3,"text":"And of course, there's the\nprovide nothing option, which"},"931":{"dur":2,"text":"actually is one of the\nbest options of all,"},"933":{"dur":4,"text":"because I don't know how you\nall are, but my smartphone"},"938":{"dur":2,"text":"and me-- we stay\ntogether all the time."},"940":{"dur":3,"text":"When I take a shower, my\nsmartphone is on the sink."},"944":{"dur":2,"text":"When I go to bed, my\nsmartphone is next-- I mean, me"},"946":{"dur":2,"text":"and my smartphone-- we're\ntogether all the time."},"949":{"dur":4,"text":"And so the issue of\nburden and aggravation"},"953":{"dur":2,"text":"is profound in this domain."},"956":{"dur":3,"text":"It's much more profound than\nin any other area of health"},"960":{"dur":3,"text":"I know of in terms of just\naggravation to the person."},"963":{"dur":3,"text":"So the provide nothing option\nis, of course, a good one."},"967":{"dur":2,"text":"So tailoring variables--\nthese are the variables"},"969":{"dur":5,"text":"you use to decide whether or not\nto provide a push or support."},"975":{"dur":3,"text":"Often, they are\nproximal responses"},"979":{"dur":1,"text":"you've already observed."},"981":{"dur":4,"text":"Whether or not you're\ngoing into a risky period,"},"985":{"dur":3,"text":"like if I want to suggest that\nyou might go and go for a walk"},"989":{"dur":2,"text":"or

we're going to do is\nwhen we talk about the signal"},"2022":{"dur":2,"text":"or what we call a\nmain effect-- that's"},"2024":{"dur":2,"text":"the signal, the effect\nof the

about,"},"2043":{"dur":1,"text":"and this is also related."},"2044":{"dur":3,"text":"This is very special\nto mobile health--"},"2048":{"dur":2,"text":"is this issue of
