doing."},"451":{"dur":3,"text":"It just happens unconsciously."},"454":{"dur":3,"text":"And knowing that something\nis an automatic behavior"},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"allows us to know\nhow to address it."},"461":{"dur":3,"text":"So other examples of\nan automatic behavior"},"464":{"dur":4,"text":"are forgetting that we're\nnot standing up straight,"},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"eating food that's just\nsitting in front of us"},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"without even being aware\nof what we're doing."},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"Those are automatic behaviors."},"475":{"dur":1,"text":"But once we know\nthat something's"},"477":{"dur":3,"text":"an automatic behavior, there are\na set of tools and strategies"},"480":{"dur":3,"text":"that we can use to change it."},"483":{"dur":1,"text":"But before we get\ninto that, let's"},"485":{"dur":1,"text":"talk about the second\ntype of behavior."},"490":{"dur":4,"text":"So while waiting at a\nstoplight to cross the street,"},"495":{"dur":6,"text":"I'd often pull out my phone,\ncheck email to burn some time."},"502":{"dur":3,"text":"And sometimes, I'd\neven cross the street"},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"while I'm still\nreading the email."},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"That's not always the best idea."},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"It can lead to accidents."},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"It can lead me tripping in\nthe middle of the street."},"515":{"dur":1,"text":"I shouldn't be doing that."},"517":{"dur":5,"text":"But I feel like I\nwasn't able to stop."},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"I felt like I had to just\nfinish reading this email,"},"525":{"dur":1,"text":"and then I'll put\nthe phone away."},"527":{"dur":5,"text":"So this is an example of what\nI call a burning behavior."},"533":{"dur":1,"text":"While automatic\nbehaviors are things"},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"that happen unconsciously,\nautomatically,"},"537":{"dur":3,"text":"burning behaviors\nare behaviors where"},"541":{"dur":5,"text":"we're aware of what we're doing,\nbut we feel powerless to stop."},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"We feel like we just can't stop."},"549":{"dur":4,"text":"So in my case, knowing that\nit was a burning behavior,"},"554":{"dur":1,"text":"I was able to stop it."},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"And part of that solution\ncomes from, every week now,"},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"I take a digital day of rest."},"562":{"dur":4,"text":"So from Friday to Saturday,\nI don't use any apps."},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't check email."},"568":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't even talk about work."},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"It's just time for\nfriends and family."},"573":{"dur":5,"text":"And I was able to\naddress that and to stop"},"579":{"dur":4,"text":"what could be a growing digital\naddiction, because I knew"},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"this was a burning behavior."},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"But before we get\ninto that, let me"},"587":{"dur":3,"text":"tell you about the\nlast type of behavior"},"591":{"dur":6,"text":"and also go into the background\nof how I came to study this."},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is my brother up here."},"600":{"dur":3,"text":"And when I was in\ngraduate school,"},"603":{"dur":3,"text":"just down the street\nhere at Stanford,"},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"my brother came up to visit."},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"Now he had been suffering from\nan

home."},"622":{"dur":3,"text":"So we brought him to\nthe emergency room."},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"And they looked at\nhim, and it turns out"},"628":{"dur":3,"text":"his intestines had burst."},"631":{"dur":3,"text":"So he was rushed into\nemergency surgery,"},"634":{"dur":3,"text":"and they saved his life."},"638":{"dur":1,"text":"He was minutes away\nfrom dying, they said."},"640":{"dur":2,"text":"They saved his life."},"642":{"dur":4,"text":"So he spent two weeks\nrecovering at Stanford Hospital."},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"Then he was prescribed\ndaily medication,"},"648":{"dur":6,"text":"advised to change his lifestyle,\nand then he was released."},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"Now try to put yourself in my\nbrother's situation the way"},"657":{"dur":1,"text":"that I did."},"659":{"dur":4,"text":"You just almost\ndied, and you've been"},"664":{"dur":2,"text":"told, change your lifestyle."},"667":{"dur":4,"text":"Now how likely do you guys\nthink you would be to do that?"},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're like my brother,\nif you're like most people,"},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"you'd say, I'm going to change."},"676":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to eat differently."},"678":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to exercise."},"680":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to take my medication."},"681":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm going to do everything\nthat I'm supposed to do."},"685":{"dur":2,"text":"And my brother said\nhe'd do that 100%."},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"But he didn't."},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"I didn't understand why."},"694":{"dur":6,"text":"I-- my family and I\nwere really close."},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"I love my brother."},"702":{"dur":5,"text":"So I was on the phone with\nmy mom for hours every day."},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"And we were trying\nto figure out,"},"710":{"dur":6,"text":"what could we do to get him to\nfollow these recommendations?"},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"Why wasn't he doing it?"},"718":{"dur":1,"text":"I was scared for him."},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"I was worried."},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"I was confused."},"723":{"dur":1,"text":"And I was frustrated."},"724":{"dur":1,"text":"And so I started\nsearching for answers."},"726":{"dur":3,"text":"I started talking to all\ndifferent types of people,"},"729":{"dur":3,"text":"experts in education, in\nmedicine, in business,"},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"and I was trying\nto find answers."},"736":{"dur":5,"text":"But I kept finding the same\none size fits all solution"},"742":{"dur":0,"text":"and answers."},"745":{"dur":4,"text":"People were saying he needed\nto have more willpower."},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"People were saying he needed to\nbe more educated about Crohn's"},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"and how to change it."},"754":{"dur":4,"text":"They were saying that he\nwasn't motivated enough"},"758":{"dur":0,"text":"about his health."},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"But my brother's smart."},"761":{"dur":0,"text":"He's motivated."},"762":{"dur":0,"text":"He's health conscious."},"763":{"dur":1,"text":"He's educated."},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"So these answers didn't\nmake sense to me."},"767":{"dur":5,"text":"And so that's why I\nstarted studying this area."},"772":{"dur":2,"text":"And after 15 years\nof studying it,"},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"I've come up with some answers."},"777":{"dur":1,"text":"So what I figured\nout is it's not"},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"about a one size\nfits all solution,"},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's not about\nblaming the individual."},"784":{"dur":4,"text":"What we need to know is that\nnot all behaviors are the same."},"789":{"dur":3,"text":"There are three\ntypes of behaviors."},"793":{"dur":5,"text":"While I was questioning why\nmy brother wasn't changing,"},"798":{"dur":3,"text":"other things were happening\nat the same time in my

keep buying albums?"},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"I was teaching\nclasses at Stanford"},"811":{"dur":4,"text":"and wondering, why was it that\nthe students in our classes"},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"would wait until the\nday a paper was due,"},"819":{"dur":2,"text":"and then they'd\nask for more time?"},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"Or I was wondering,\nhow could I get myself,"},"823":{"dur":2,"text":"where I was working on\nso many different things,"},"825":{"dur":4,"text":"to stay engaged and motivated\nin doing all of them?"},"830":{"dur":3,"text":"Now all these seem like\nreally different things,"},"833":{"dur":5,"text":"but if you look deeper,\nthey're actually"},"838":{"dur":2,"text":"united by one common thread."},"840":{"dur":5,"text":"And that's, how do we get\npeople to stick with things?"},"846":{"dur":3,"text":"So people often\nwere even planning"},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"what they were going to do,\nbut they still kept failing."},"852":{"dur":1,"text":"So how do we get people\nto stick with things?"},"854":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, what I found\nis that we need"},"858":{"dur":4,"text":"to know the three\ntypes of behaviors."},"862":{"dur":2,"text":"So the three types\nof behaviors are"},"864":{"dur":2,"text":"automatic, burning,\nand common behaviors,"},"867":{"dur":2,"text":"or what I call the\nABCs of behavior."},"869":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'll do a quick\nrecap about that."},"872":{"dur":1,"text":"Automatic behaviors,\nare behaviors"},"874":{"dur":6,"text":"that happen unconsciously, like\nthe example of the interrupter."},"880":{"dur":3,"text":"Burning behaviors,\nburning behaviors."},"883":{"dur":4,"text":"are behaviors that are not\nhappening unconsciously,"},"888":{"dur":1,"text":"but we feel powerless to stop."},"890":{"dur":3,"text":"Addictions are often\nburning behaviors."},"894":{"dur":3,"text":"And then third are\ncommon behaviors."},"897":{"dur":4,"text":"Common behaviors are the\nmost common of all behaviors."},"901":{"dur":3,"text":"Common behaviors are\noften due to motivation."},"905":{"dur":3,"text":"So a common behavior\nis something"},"908":{"dur":4,"text":"where we're aware\nof what we're doing,"},"913":{"dur":4,"text":"but the risks of doing\nit, or the energy"},"917":{"dur":4,"text":"that it takes for us to do\nit, isn't worth the benefits"},"921":{"dur":2,"text":"we think we might\nget from doing it."},"923":{"dur":1,"text":"So let me say that again."},"925":{"dur":0,"text":"I'll repeat that."},"926":{"dur":2,"text":"Common behavior\nis something where"},"928":{"dur":2,"text":"the energy that it takes\nfor us to do something,"},"930":{"dur":2,"text":"or the risk that it\ntakes for us to do it,"},"933":{"dur":4,"text":"isn't worth the benefit we think\nwe might get from doing it."},"937":{"dur":3,"text":"So let me give an example,\nbecause that's a lot."},"940":{"dur":3,"text":"So my brothers lifestyle\nchange was an example"},"944":{"dur":2,"text":"of a common behavior."},"946":{"dur":4,"text":"Because despite being told that\nhe should change his lifestyle,"},"951":{"dur":3,"text":"and that may keep him out of\nthe hospital, he didn't think"},"954":{"dur":2,"text":"it was worth it to change."},"957":{"dur":4,"text":"Why should he give up\nthings that he loved doing?"},"962":{"dur":2,"text":"Why should he change\nthe way he eats?"},"964":{"dur":4,"text":"Why should he exercise more,\nmeditate, take medication?"},"968":{"dur":2,"text":"Why should he do these\nthings if there wasn't even"},"971":{"dur":3,"text":"a guarantee that it would work?"},"974":{"dur":2,"text":"That's a common behavior."},"977":{"dur":5,"text":"But knowing that something is\na common behavior, or an A or B"},"982":{"dur":2,"text":"behavior, allows us\nto know how to fix it."},"985":{"dur":2,"text":"We just need to know\nthe set of tools"},"987":{"dur":1,"text":"for fixing those\ntypes of behaviors."},"993":{"dur":1,"text":"So the set of tools\nare what I call"},"994":{"dur":1,"text":"the forces of behavior change."},"996":{"dur":5,"text":"Now you guys may have\nlearned in physics that there"},"1001":{"dur":2,"text":"are forces that move objects--"},"1004":{"dur":3,"text":"that move objects--\ncan't move this."},"1008":{"dur":4,"text":"There are forces that move\nobjects in certain directions."},"1012":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, there are behavioral\nforces that move people."},"1016":{"dur":2,"text":"They get us to behave\nin certain ways."},"1021":{"dur":5,"text":"Now just as a flight crew, or\na pilot, or aerospace engineers"},"1026":{"dur":3,"text":"need to

can\nbehave the way we want."},"1037":{"dur":1,"text":"There are seven of these forces."},"1041":{"dur":3,"text":"So what I did, I came up with\na framework called SCIENCE,"},"1045":{"dur":4,"text":"where each one of the\nletters of SCIENCE"},"1049":{"dur":2,"text":"represents a different\none of the seven forces."},"1052":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's

important"},"2313":{"dur":3,"text":"if we can include community,\nthat will help out a lot."},"2317":{"dur":2,"text":"So the question is, do\nyou live with anyone?"},"2319":{"dur":0,"text":"CHRIS: I

where\ndiscussions come in."},"2367":{"dur":3,"text":"Would she be willing to change?"},"2371":{"dur":2,"text":"Could you have this discussion\nwith her where both of you

solution."},"2382":{"dur":3,"text":"CHRIS: Well, she tends to\nstay up later and watch TV,"},"2385":{"dur":5,"text":"so we could have hours where she\neats her stuff, and I eat mine."},"2391":{"dur":2,"text":"SEAN YOUNG: Got it, OK."},"2393":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's a more difficult one."},"2397":{"dur":7,"text":"But what we can do is\nEasy is very

a way for\nyou to either just get"},"2413":{"dur":2,"text":"the chocolate out of the house,\nnot have chocolate around?"},"2416":{"dur":2,"text":"CHRIS: Well, I've moved\nit out of the office"},"2418":{"dur":0,"text":"and into the pantry."},"2419":{"dur":0,"text":"SEAN YOUNG: Perfect."},"2420":{"dur":4,"text":"CHRIS: So I have to go\ndownstairs to do it."},"2424":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's further away."},"2426":{"dur":1,"text":"SEAN YOUNG: Excellent."},"2427":{"dur":4,"text":"So that's an example of,\nif it's further away,"},"2432":{"dur":2,"text":"then it's going to\nbe harder to do,"},"2434":{"dur":1,"text":"it's not going to be\nas easy, and you'll"},"2436":{"dur":1,"text":"be less likely to do it."},"2437":{"dur":3,"text":"And how has that\nworked out for you?"},"2441":{"dur":1,"text":"CHRIS: It's lessened the intake."},"2442":{"dur":2,"text":"SEAN YOUNG: Great."},"2445":{"dur":2,"text":"So the next step would be, can\nyou get it out of the

want to,\nbut I can for periods of time."},"2459":{"dur":4,"text":"And then I feel like\nI have to sort of--"},"2463":{"dur":2,"text":"I just have to have some."},"2466":{"dur":1,"text":"SEAN YOUNG: So if\nyou can make it"},"2468":{"dur":1,"text":"where you have to\ngo to the store"},"2470":{"dur":2,"text":"in order to get\nthe chocolate, that"},"2472":{"dur":2,"text":"will lessen the amount of\nchocolate that you're eating."},"2474":{"dur":2,"text":"That's a simple one that\ndefinitely makes it easy."},"2479":{"dur":2,"text":"Also, are there\nother kinds of foods"},"2482":{"dur":2,"text":"that you would like that you\ncan put, other than chocolate,"},"2484":{"dur":1,"text":"you can make closer to you?"},"2485":{"dur":1,"text":"So when you're sitting\naround, watching TV,"},"2487":{"dur":2,"text":"can you put food in front of\nyou, other than chocolate,"},"2490":{"dur":2,"text":"that you would eat, and\nit would just fill you up?"},"2492":{"dur":2,"text":"CHRIS: Yeah, I like fruit,\nand that won't keep me awake."},"2494":{"dur":1,"text":"SEAN YOUNG: Great, great."},"2496":{"dur":4,"text":"So that's another example\nof how we can use Easy."},"2500":{"dur":2,"text":"We can do this in\na gradual process,"},"2503":{"dur":2,"text":"like don't just necessarily\nthrow all the chocolate out"},"2505":{"dur":1,"text":"of the house if you don't\nthink that will work."},"2507":{"dur":2,"text":"But you can start with just\nputting fruit in front of you,"},"2510":{"dur":1,"text":"and eating the\nfruit or other food."},"2512":{"dur":4,"text":"And what you'll find is that\nas that becomes a routine,"},"2516":{"dur":2,"text":"it will become\nengrained in your brain."},"2519":{"dur":1,"text":"Every day, you'll\nstart doing it."},"2520":{"dur":1,"text":"And it'll become a neurohack."},"2522":{"dur":3,"text":"So you might think, I'm not\ncapable of stopping myself"},"2525":{"dur":1,"text":"from eating chocolate."},"2527":{"dur":3,"text":"But as you see, day after\nday, that you're eating fruit"},"2530":{"dur":3,"text":"instead, you'll realize,\nthere's nothing wrong with me."},"2533":{"dur":3,"text":"It's not like I'm just wired\nto have to have this chocolate."},"2537":{"dur":1,"text":"But you're capable of doing it."},"2538":{"dur":3,"text":"And it will reset your
