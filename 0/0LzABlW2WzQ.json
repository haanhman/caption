of."},"82":{"dur":3,"text":"Besides that, I didn't wanna join my father's\nlaw firm."},"86":{"dur":5,"text":"Rick: So when you got inspired, what did you\ndo back in '65?"},"91":{"dur":1,"text":"Checker: Well, two things."},"92":{"dur":4,"text":"One is I enrolled in the Graduate School of\nEducation immediately, into what became a"},"97":{"dur":2,"text":"MIT program and then a doctorate in education\npolicy."},"100":{"dur":6,"text":"And the other thing was I started volunteering\nin the war on poverty in as it happened,

proficient, by anything like 2014."},"360":{"dur":3,"text":"So the first was educators said, \"Pa, [SP]\nwe can ignore this."},"363":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not gonna happen.\""},"365":{"dur":5,"text":"The other was that States policymakers elected\nofficials wanting to maximize the number of"},"370":{"dur":6,"text":"kids who are deemed to be proficient, tended\nto

achieving not enough,"},"386":{"dur":4,"text":"to lower the bar that they have to clear in\nthe name of getting more of them over it is"},"391":{"dur":3,"text":"an unintended consequence that I think is\nindeed negative."},"394":{"dur":5,"text":"Rick: So if educators said, \"Pa, this isn't\nserious,\" how come it's felt like NCLB had"},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"such an impact on school practice?"},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"[inaudible 00:06:35] so much complaint about\novertesting?"},"405":{"dur":6,"text":"Checker: Because it hinged everything on test\nscores and in just two subjects,
