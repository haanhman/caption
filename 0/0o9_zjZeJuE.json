documentation."},"1858":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is where the SAD comes into play."},"1861":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's called the SAD\nbecause it makes you sad."},"1864":{"dur":1,"text":"And there are

the software work?"},"2003":{"dur":2,"text":"(sighs) You choose, I don't care."},"2006":{"dur":1,"text":"It's the tooling thing and what tooling"},"2008":{"dur":1,"text":"do you recommend for

control."},"2026":{"dur":1,"text":"And then they do stuff at build time,"},"2028":{"dur":3,"text":"generate HTML, uploading to\nwebsites and Wikis and so on."},"2031":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's a lot

this is the code I wrote to document"},"2046":{"dur":1,"text":"my little API application."},"2048":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a bunch of simple mark down files,"},"2049":{"dur":2,"text":"you upload it as

or two"},"2109":{"dur":2,"text":"to get a good jump-off point into the code"},"2112":{"dur":3,"text":"so that I can go and explore\nin a much more structured way,"},"2115":{"dur":2,"text":"much more structured manner."},"2119":{"dur":3,"text":"To speak of exploring,\nonce you start to model"},"2122":{"dur":2,"text":"your software, you can do\nsome really interesting"},"2124":{"dur":1,"text":"stuff with it."},"2126":{"dur":3,"text":"So you can do things like\ncreate a JavaScript D3"},"2129":{"dur":1,"text":"visualization of the static elements,"},"2131":{"dur":1,"text":"it's just a tree structure."},"2133":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is a model that one\nof the sample applications"},"2136":{"dur":2,"text":"from the Spring Team,

components"},"2151":{"dur":1,"text":"based on size and complexity."},"2153":{"dur":1,"text":"So again, once you have\na model, you can do"},"2154":{"dur":1,"text":"some cool stuff with it."},"2156":{"dur":2,"text":"You can throw it into Neo4j\nif you really want to."},"2158":{"dur":1,"text":"Why not?"},"2159":{"dur":2,"text":"The software architecture model\nis just a directive graph."},"2162":{"dur":2,"text":"You throw it into Neo4j and\nyou can query it or cypher."},"2164":{"dur":1,"text":"People are actually doing this."},"2166":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a whole set of\ntooling called jQAssistant"},"2169":{"dur":1,"text":"that let's you do this."},"2170":{"dur":1,"text":"You run it, it gets your source code,"},"2171":{"dur":1,"text":"you set up some rules and basically"},"2173":{"dur":3,"text":"it pops it into Neo behind\nthe scenes, it's awesome."},"2176":{"dur":2,"text":"And these guys, Empear, they've\ncreated a set of tooling"},"2179":{"dur":2,"text":"that runs against your\nsource code repositories"},"2182":{"dur":2,"text":"and not only are they\ndoing static analysis,"},"2185":{"dur":2,"text":"but they're also

always changed"},"2192":{"dur":2,"text":"by these two different teams, why is that?"},"2195":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe we've got the component\nboundaries incorrect"},"2197":{"dur":1,"text":"in this
