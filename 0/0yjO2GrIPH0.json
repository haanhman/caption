people"},"621":{"dur":3,"text":"like James Watt was absolutely\nkey to that and we all know"},"625":{"dur":3,"text":"that as the first\nindustrial revolution."},"630":{"dur":5,"text":"I also learnt that John\nKnox who was of course key"},"635":{"dur":4,"text":"on Scottish culture back\nin those days also said"},"640":{"dur":3,"text":"that 'Scotland had another\nhuge great advantage in terms"},"644":{"dur":3,"text":"of just the high level of\nliteracy and numeracy',"},"647":{"dur":4,"text":"hence global communication\nskills which helped Scotland"},"652":{"dur":1,"text":"And I

saying."},"659":{"dur":3,"text":"[laughter] But nonetheless,\nclearly you did manage"},"662":{"dur":3,"text":"to communicate rather\nexcellently across the world."},"666":{"dur":4,"text":"So moving on to the second\nindustrial revolution"},"670":{"dur":3,"text":"which is clearly the rise\nof electrical engineering,"},"674":{"dur":3,"text":"we started to see the\nbeginning of mass production"},"678":{"dur":4,"text":"and we carried on seeing the\ngreat Scottish inventors going"},"683":{"dur":3,"text":"into this second\nindustrial revolution."},"686":{"dur":5,"text":"There was James Beaumont Neilson\nand his hot-blast process"},"692":{"dur":4,"text":"which greatly reduced the\ncost of producing pig iron"},"696":{"dur":3,"text":"which of course was very key\nto this industrial revolution"},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"and what was very interesting\nhere is when you dig"},"702":{"dur":4,"text":"into the Siemens archives\nis that our founder"},"707":{"dur":3,"text":"of our company William\nvon Siemens,"},"710":{"dur":5,"text":"he actually invented the\nSiemens open-hearth furnace."},"715":{"dur":3,"text":"It was a new steel making\nprocess that competed"},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"with the Bessemer\nsteel making process."},"721":{"dur":3,"text":"There was two reasons why that\nwas required; one is the quality"},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"of the steel that was coming"},"728":{"dur":3,"text":"out of the Bessemer process\nwasn't quite good enough"},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"for heavy scale construction\nand also people wanted a bit"},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"of competition for Bessemer\nbecause he was asking"},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"for a bit too much money for\nthe licences for his process,"},"741":{"dur":1,"text":"so that's where Siemens came in."},"743":{"dur":1,"text":"And really quite amazingly,"},"744":{"dur":4,"text":"the Siemens steel making\nprocess was the first steel"},"748":{"dur":4,"text":"of the high enough quality to\nbe able to build major bridges"},"753":{"dur":3,"text":"and indeed the Forth Railway\nBridge was the first major"},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"structure in Great Britain that\nwas built with steel produced"},"760":{"dur":3,"text":"by the Siemens open-hearth\nsteel making process,"},"763":{"dur":4,"text":"so quite incredible histories\nthat were going on back then."},"768":{"dur":4,"text":"And so we went on to do some\npretty great things in 1869,"},"773":{"dur":4,"text":"Siemens laid the first India\nEuropean telegraph link,"},"778":{"dur":2,"text":"so that was running\nfrom London to Calcutta"},"781":{"dur":3,"text":"and I guess it also\nwent up to Scotland"},"784":{"dur":2,"text":"at some point very\nsoon afterwards."},"786":{"dur":1,"text":"And I would assume\nthat at the end"},"788":{"dur":3,"text":"of those telegraph poles were\nlots of telephones invented"},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"of course by your\nvery Graham Bell."},"795":{"dur":3,"text":"So again, Siemens meets\nScottish technology."},"799":{"dur":3,"text":"But we move on to the\nthird industrial revolution"},"802":{"dur":4,"text":"and I guess this is really\nwhere sort of Siemens started"},"807":{"dur":4,"text":"to have a very significant\nimpact because this is"},"811":{"dur":4,"text":"when IT started to have\nan impact on factories;"},"817":{"dur":3,"text":"the first industrial\ncontrols were invested."},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was actually quite\nlate on through that period,"},"824":{"dur":2,"text":"sort of only in the 1980s"},"826":{"dur":4,"text":"when the first microprocessors\nwere invented that we were able"},"830":{"dur":3,"text":"to create our first Siemens\nprogrammable logic controllers"},"834":{"dur":3,"text":"and those found their ways\ninto factories and started"},"838":{"dur":3,"text":"to improve the efficiencies and\nthe productivities of factories."},"842":{"dur":1,"text":"As a matter of fact, I remember"},"844":{"dur":3,"text":"in my production engineering\ndegree in those 1980s,"},"848":{"dur":3,"text":"I was working on one of those\nvery early microprocessors"},"851":{"dur":3,"text":"and when you think about the\nlack of processing power you had"},"854":{"dur":1,"text":"to do back in those\ndays compared"},"856":{"dur":2,"text":"to today it's actually\nquite unbelievable."},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, unfortunately something\nquite sad was happening"},"862":{"dur":4,"text":"by this point in British\nmanufacturing and that is"},"866":{"dur":2,"text":"that our manufacturing for print"},"869":{"dur":3,"text":"in the UK was dropping\noff at quite a fast rate."},"872":{"dur":3,"text":"We'd sort of lost our edge\nin terms of innovation,"},"876":{"dur":2,"text":"so all of those great\ninventors I was talking"},"878":{"dur":2,"text":"about somehow we weren't\nreplacing with new ones,"},"881":{"dur":3,"text":"and you know, we in this room\nI don't think really need a lot"},"885":{"dur":4,"text":"of reminding of how\nbad it started getting."},"890":{"dur":1,"text":"We know that the relative share"},"891":{"dur":4,"text":"of manufacturing back then was\nsort of 30 percent of GDP -"},"896":{"dur":2,"text":"today it's more like 10 percent."},"898":{"dur":2,"text":"We know that we employed\nnine million people"},"901":{"dur":2,"text":"in manufacturing back then\nin the United Kingdom;"},"903":{"dur":3,"text":"it's three million today\netcetera, etcetera, etcetera"},"907":{"dur":2,"text":"and it wasn't all so good."},"910":{"dur":3,"text":"But let's not look back and\ndepress ourselves too much"},"914":{"dur":4,"text":"because this lecture is going\nto be more about moving forward"},"918":{"dur":3,"text":"and in terms of what we need\nto do to hopefully get back"},"922":{"dur":5,"text":"into the race in this 'fourth\nindustrial revolution'."},"927":{"dur":3,"text":"And before we do that let's\njust have a look at what some"},"931":{"dur":7,"text":"of the key drivers of change are\nthat might allow us to get back"},"938":{"dur":2,"text":"into this industrial revolution."},"941":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think there really\nare some opportunities here"},"944":{"dur":4,"text":"for Great Britain for our\ninnovation that we have here."},"949":{"dur":4,"text":"So and the first driver is,\nis clearly just the speed"},"955":{"dur":3,"text":"at which innovation is\nhappening in engineering"},"958":{"dur":2,"text":"and manufacturing environments."},"961":{"dur":4,"text":"So you know we are increasingly\nseeing collaborative robots"},"965":{"dur":2,"text":"in some of our

sorts"},"974":{"dur":3,"text":"of technologies are massively\nchanging what happens"},"978":{"dur":2,"text":"in a manufacturing environment."},"981":{"dur":3,"text":"And clearly manufacturing\ncompanies are therefore having"},"984":{"dur":3,"text":"to just innovate at\na much faster pace,"},"987":{"dur":2,"text":"having to invest more\nin R&D and having"},"991":{"dur":1,"text":"to have much more collaboration"},"993":{"dur":2,"text":"with technology innovation\ncentres like the one"},"996":{"dur":3,"text":"that we are standing here today,\nand I think that is something"},"999":{"dur":4,"text":"which we in developed economies\nare going to be very good at."},"1004":{"dur":1,"text":"So I think we have\nan opportunity"},"1006":{"dur":1,"text":"with our great British\nuniversities"},"1008":{"dur":4,"text":"and of course this one here\nto be able to do a lot of that"},"1012":{"dur":3,"text":"in a very collaborative -\nin a very collaborative way."},"1016":{"dur":2,"text":"And indeed in my\nvisit here today,"},"1019":{"dur":5,"text":"I have seen Strathclyde playing\nvery much a leading role in

been\ncoming at quite the speed"},"1092":{"dur":3,"text":"but we're beginning to\nsee it more and more."},"1095":{"dur":4,"text":"And basically that is being\nable to produce products"},"1100":{"dur":4,"text":"at a batch size of one but doing\nthat at mass production prices."},"1105":{"dur":2,"text":"That is the sort of\nchallenge that we have"},"1107":{"dur":2,"text":"in this new customised world."},"1109":{"dur":2,"text":"And obviously that needs\na lot of flexibility,"},"1112":{"dur":3,"text":"much faster design cycles\nand ultimately it's going"},"1116":{"dur":4,"text":"to need a huge amount of\ntechnology to help you manage"},"1121":{"dur":2,"text":"that sort of a production\nprocess."},"1123":{"dur":5,"text":"And that brings me to
