But Madison, I think, is the next\nfigure."},"566":{"dur":5,"text":"And if you look at the list of his achievements,\nyou get a feel for this, I think. First, of"},"571":{"dur":5,"text":"course, the calling of the Constitutional\nConvention in 1787 when the nation was at"},"577":{"dur":9,"text":"risk of falling apart. The Federalist Papers\nwhich were written to support the ratification"},"586":{"dur":8,"text":"of the convention -- of the Constitution.\nHe then led the battle for ratification itself."},"595":{"dur":6,"text":"He was the first leading member of Congress\nwhich established the new government.

In"},"613":{"dur":5,"text":"the pivotal election of 1800, he was the co-architect\nof the transfer of government from the federalist"},"619":{"dur":5,"text":"party of John Adams to the Thomas Jefferson\nas leader of the Republicans. It was many"},"625":{"dur":5,"text":"times said that the true test of a representative\ngovernment is if you can have a peaceful transfer"},"631":{"dur":5,"text":"of power between contending parties.

Which doubled the size of the nation."},"642":{"dur":7,"text":"He was our first war-time President. Through the war of 1812. Not always a glorious chapter in our history"},"649":{"dur":4,"text":"but one that was ended successfully enough, I suppose is the best way to say it."},"655":{"dur":5,"text":"And he was perhaps our only two-term President\nwho had a better second term than first term."},"661":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, think about that and think about your\nown life and the Presidents you've known who"},"666":{"dur":3,"text":"have served two terms.

It is a flip answer but"},"765":{"dur":7,"text":"I think there's something to that actually.\nBut there is another answer, too. He was different"},"773":{"dur":7,"text":"from most great leaders. We think of great\nleaders most often as men -- most often men,"},"780":{"dur":5,"text":"but women too, who have strong streaks of\nnarcissism.

His greatest achievements\nwere really the fruit of partnerships. And"},"899":{"dur":5,"text":"it seemed to me that it was almost as though\nhe had taken what today would be called a"},"905":{"dur":4,"text":"modern personality assessment, the sort of\nthing organizations like their people to do"},"909":{"dur":9,"text":"and turn them into extroverts, introverts,\nwhatever.

So why not take those gifts\nand marry them to someone else who has the"},"958":{"dur":5,"text":"gifts he doesn't have?\nNow, we don't know that Madison actually did"},"963":{"dur":7,"text":"that, made such an assessment, stared at the\nmirror for the requisite period of seconds."},"970":{"dur":6,"text":"But I found that the concept provided a clarifying\nlens through which to look at his extraordinary"},"977":{"dur":7,"text":"career.

This is in 1783 when we are still\noperating under the Articles of Confederation."},"1086":{"dur":5,"text":"I think they recognized in each other, first,\ngreat intelligence.
