I\u00a0was quite\npissed off with Bill, because lobbying politicians"},"2307":{"dur":9,"text":"is not something that we all hadn\u2019t done\nover many, many, many years.

But politicians, like other people, like\nto be loved. So what we needed to do was not"},"2341":{"dur":5,"text":"do individual lobbying, as we\u2019d been doing\npreviously, but to get a grassroots swell."},"2347":{"dur":9,"text":"Which the NDIS campaign and The Every Australian\nCounts campaign\u00a0did, where people with disabilities"},"2357":{"dur":8,"text":"went to their local politicians and just talked\nto them about what could happen if we got"},"2366":{"dur":10,"text":"the funding to live independently. And politicians\nfound themselves nodding thankfully and having"},"2376":{"dur":8,"text":"pictures taken, but then in the end found\nthemselves being pushed into something where"},"2385":{"dur":10,"text":"they had to commit themselves. You talk about\n1974. Since the early 70s when the Americans"},"2395":{"dur":9,"text":"started to get personal funding to move out\nof institutions and into their own homes\u00a0and"},"2405":{"dur":11,"text":"apartments back in Australia we saw that this\nwas the way we wanted to go as well. And we"},"2416":{"dur":8,"text":"came together as advocacy groups, which were\nall about human rights, but politicians didn't"},"2425":{"dur":7,"text":"want to know about human rights. They just\nwanted to feel good. Most of the big charities"},"2433":{"dur":7,"text":"helped them feel good - in funding the big\ncharities. But the services that they provided"},"2440":{"dur":9,"text":"were all around large institutions or institutional\nliving or employment and accommodation. What"},"2450":{"dur":7,"text":"we wanted was to be independent and live our\nown lives. We wanted to have families. We"},"2457":{"dur":5,"text":"wanted to live in the community. We wanted\npublic transport that we could actually get"},"2462":{"dur":13,"text":"onto and use. So over the years we fought\nfor this. With the election of the Labor government"},"2476":{"dur":8,"text":"in 2008, and the 2020 Summit and the big thinktank\nabout how Australia could be better, one of"},"2485":{"dur":6,"text":"the ideas that almost didn't make it out of\nthe summit\u00a0 it seemed to be forgotten about"},"2491":{"dur":12,"text":"there for a while\u00a0 but finally brought up\nfor the final paper by Tanya Pliberseck was"},"2504":{"dur":8,"text":"the National Disability Insurance Scheme.\nAnd people started to look in a different"},"2512":{"dur":9,"text":"way at what that should be. So, no longer\nwere they all out lobbying around whether"},"2521":{"dur":5,"text":"it was a charity, a nice thing to do for people\nwith disabilities\u00a0\u2013 whether it was our"},"2527":{"dur":8,"text":"human rights.

I don\u2019t"},"2551":{"dur":5,"text":"know. Can I just maybe challenge you on that.\nI think one of the key things from there"},"2556":{"dur":12,"text":"you might want to jump in on this\u00a0 is that\nwe were\u00a0 the idea of an NDIA was partly about"},"2568":{"dur":10,"text":"people being afraid of becoming disabled themselves\nand what if there had been some kind of way"},"2578":{"dur":5,"text":"of ensuring that if they did become disabled\nthere would be some form of insurance or something"},"2584":{"dur":7,"text":"that would be there to support them. And we\nsaw images of people and families and children"},"2591":{"dur":8,"text":"saying, \"This could happen to your child.\"\nDo you think maybe there was a danger that"},"2599":{"dur":8,"text":"we fell back into the pity approach with the\nmedia that was occurring at the time or were"},"2608":{"dur":9,"text":"you confident that that wasn't going to happen?\nI think there was certainly a lot of concern"},"2618":{"dur":7,"text":"at the time about, well, disability has always\nbeen portrayed as about this thing where you\u2019re"},"2626":{"dur":5,"text":"rattling the tins and as Frank just said,\ngetting money for charities. How are we gonna"},"2632":{"dur":4,"text":"do this? And people were concerned about that.\nBecause one of the drivers of the Every Australian"},"2637":{"dur":5,"text":"Counts campaign, one of the things that came\nout of Bill's statements to the sector about,"},"2642":{"dur":6,"text":"you know, you guys need to get organised,\nyou guys aren't campaigning properly. Everybody"},"2648":{"dur":4,"text":"bristled at that but then what happened was\nwe got what\u2019s called the National Disability"},"2653":{"dur":9,"text":"and Carer Alliance. That was formed by some\nkey people. It was formed by Bruce\u00a0Bonahady,"},"2662":{"dur":10,"text":"the man who took the idea to the 2020 Summit\u00a0that\nFrank just talked about, and who is a family"},"2672":{"dur":5,"text":"member, with family members who have disability.\nRhonda Galbally, who has a disability herself"},"2678":{"dur":9,"text":"and has run businesses and worked in fairly\nhigh-profile places. And by the leaders of"},"2688":{"dur":5,"text":"National Disability Services, at the time\nKen Baker.

Is she older than you? No. She\u2019s"},"2709":{"dur":11,"text":"my younger sister. Younger? Oh, that explains\na lot. Lesley Hall. So, I think there was"},"2720":{"dur":5,"text":"concern among the community of people with\ndisabilities about all three of those groups"},"2725":{"dur":7,"text":"coming together, about, you know, because\nthere had been this historical imbalance of"},"2733":{"dur":5,"text":"service providers who\u2019ve held the money,\npeople with disabilities have often felt that"},"2738":{"dur":5,"text":"families and carers are listened to and service\nproviders are listened to before they are"},"2744":{"dur":6,"text":"listened to. And not necessarily because service\nproviders and families are evil or mean to"},"2751":{"dur":4,"text":"do bad things sometimes. But because that's\nthe way our system has worked. And because"},"2755":{"dur":7,"text":"our society over a long period of time has\nseen people with disability as powerless and"},"2763":{"dur":6,"text":"passive. So there was real concern that that\nwould happen, I think, and there was a real"},"2769":{"dur":5,"text":"risk that it might. I remember Stella Young\ncoming up to me during one of the conferences"},"2774":{"dur":7,"text":"and saying, \"George, what are we going to\ndo about this?\" I said, \"What are you referring"},"2782":{"dur":8,"text":"to?\" She said, \"I'm really worried that we\nare actually being manipulated in a way so"},"2790":{"dur":6,"text":"that people feel sorry for us. For so many\nyears we have tried to combat that\u201d and"},"2797":{"dur":9,"text":"like we saw on the screen, to fight the \u2018spastic\nsociety\u2019 approach to disability. But I think"},"2806":{"dur":10,"text":"that there came a time when we united, when\nwe realised that there was an end goal in"},"2817":{"dur":9,"text":"sight and that we were willing to keep our\neye on that goal and not be I guess fractured"},"2827":{"dur":9,"text":"and put into a situation where we were fighting\namongst ourselves. Can I ask, back to you,"},"2836":{"dur":6,"text":"Frank. Was there a moment in the campaign\nwhen you actually thought maybe this is going"},"2843":{"dur":9,"text":"to result in something? Maybe we might win\nthis time? No! There never was a moment. And"},"2853":{"dur":6,"text":"there still isn't. We really shouldn't delude\nourselves into believing this is achieved"},"2859":{"dur":6,"text":"and doesn't need to be lobbied for in the\nfuture. I love the conspiracy theory. Look"},"2865":{"dur":7,"text":"at what has happened to Gonski and the education\nreforms? We really have to be on our guard"},"2872":{"dur":5,"text":"continually to make sure that this happens.\nSo what will it take? You\u2019re a hard\u00a0man,"},"2878":{"dur":7,"text":"can I tell. What is it gonna take for you\nto be convinced? We need to continue to be"},"2885":{"dur":8,"text":"involved. We have set up a big bureaucracy\nof the NDIA. And like all big bureaucracis,"},"2894":{"dur":6,"text":"slowly it becomes not about the clients or\nthe people with disabilities but about its"},"2901":{"dur":9,"text":"own survival, about its staff, about the bureaucracy,\nabout administration rather than about promoting"},"2910":{"dur":7,"text":"the full independence of people with disabilities.\nIt becomes about budgets. So we really all"},"2918":{"dur":8,"text":"need to take responsibility for continuing\nto be involved and to keep on top of that."},"2926":{"dur":9,"text":"At the moment we still have bipartisan support\nfrom all politicians, which is great. We did"},"2936":{"dur":7,"text":"see before the last election there was a bit\nof, \"Hmm\" and toing and froing about that,"},"2943":{"dur":9,"text":"and finally they came on board. But again,\nthat is what we've got to continue with. We"},"2953":{"dur":8,"text":"have got to make sure that the politicians\nthat are involved are still committed to it."},"2962":{"dur":14,"text":"And not just the idea but the actual funding\nof it. This could go terribly sour if future"},"2976":{"dur":6,"text":"budgets don't provide the funding.

It\u2019s a constant fight. Absolutely.\nWe need to stay vigilant. We need to stay"},"2999":{"dur":9,"text":"vigilant, because of the fact that\u00a0\u2013 all\nwe need is someone to come in and say, \"This"},"3009":{"dur":7,"text":"is something we need to cut back and funding\nneeds to be redirected somewhere else.\" As"},"3016":{"dur":8,"text":"advocates and as a community we need to definitely\nstay vigilant. I just want to mention that"},"3024":{"dur":7,"text":"we are open to questions from the floor. We\nhave an open mic, if anyone has a question"},"3032":{"dur":14,"text":"for any of us on the panel.

One of the key things that\nhappened after the idea bubbled up at the"},"3110":{"dur":8,"text":"2020 Summit for an NDIS was that the then\nRudd government committed to a Productivity"},"3119":{"dur":7,"text":"Commission inquiry into disability care and\nsupport in Australia. And the Productivity"},"3127":{"dur":5,"text":"Commission is an organisation that is funded\nby government but separate to it, but does"},"3133":{"dur":8,"text":"a lot of detailed economic research for government.\nI think the reason that the Productivity Commission"},"3141":{"dur":6,"text":"was critical was because it laid the groundwork\nin a couple of ways. They did a lot of the"},"3147":{"dur":7,"text":"detailed economic thinking around, okay, how\nmuch money needs to go into this, what is"},"3154":{"dur":7,"text":"the need for disability supports in Australia?\nThey did a lot of research into what was happening"},"3162":{"dur":3,"text":"in all of the different state and territory\nsystems, because everything had been different."},"3166":{"dur":3,"text":"There were different rules everywhere. So\nthey did a lot of research. But the other"},"3170":{"dur":7,"text":"thing that was really, really critical about\nthe Productivity Commission report was that"},"3178":{"dur":7,"text":"it was formed after having two rounds of hearings,\nhearing directly from people with disabilities"},"3185":{"dur":6,"text":"and their families about the impact of the\ncurrent disability system on their day-to-day"},"3191":{"dur":6,"text":"lives. That was crucial in both formulating\na sense for the Productivity Commission of"},"3198":{"dur":6,"text":"just how critical this was and what the face\nof disability supports was in Australia. But"},"3204":{"dur":4,"text":"also in raising the consciousness of people\nwith disabilities and families around the"},"3208":{"dur":7,"text":"country about how it is that we could go about\nenacting change. It was a process of empowering"},"3215":{"dur":6,"text":"people to speak up about the state of disability\nservices in Australia and to be a bit of a"},"3222":{"dur":5,"text":"focal point for people to come together and\ngo, \"Yes, they is something we can start talking"},"3228":{"dur":5,"text":"more about and working together on.\" Do I\nthink the Productivity Commission model is"},"3233":{"dur":5,"text":"an appropriate model? I think the Productivity\nCommission put a lot of thought and effort"},"3239":{"dur":6,"text":"into thinking about the model and into making\nsure that it would be workable. I think how"},"3245":{"dur":5,"text":"it's implemented matters. And what we learn\nfrom the trial sites that are happening around"},"3251":{"dur":4,"text":"the country at the moment\u00a0matters as well.\nBecause it's one thing to write a document"},"3256":{"dur":4,"text":"and to think about something in theory and\nanother thing to put it in place in reality."},"3261":{"dur":5,"text":"I think it was a good, important beginning\nstep and it\u2019s a solid foundation, but we"},"3266":{"dur":12,"text":"also need to learn as we go. I suppose, you\nknow, at one time there was the talk about"},"3278":{"dur":8,"text":"a Medicare levy being the funding source for\nthe NDIS. In the end it was chosen that it"},"3287":{"dur":10,"text":"would go into general budgeting. Correct me,\nbut there is a levy that's now part of the"},"3297":{"dur":10,"text":"Medicare Levy.

I certainly"},"3781":{"dur":7,"text":"took away some important little messages.\nI just want to recap. Please feel free to"},"3789":{"dur":7,"text":"move away if you need to. Just for the audience,\nFrank and Leah told us the importance of getting"},"3796":{"dur":6,"text":"the economic arguments right and using the\nProductivity Commission, which is a very important"},"3803":{"dur":8,"text":"lesson. And Leah told us that both styles\nof advocacy are important. Both people that"},"3811":{"dur":6,"text":"are inside the tent, the suits, and those\nthat are outside it. Sometimes taking a more"},"3818":{"dur":7,"text":"radical approach.

Thank you, Sarah, for\nleading the session. There has been a slight"},"3918":{"dur":7,"text":"change of panel lineup since I got my notes,\nbut I can run with that. Before we start the"},"3926":{"dur":7,"text":"panel, I just wanted to clarify a couple of\nthings about my film. It was said that the"},"3933":{"dur":5,"text":"film is finished and ready to see. Unfortunately,\nmuch to my frustration, that's not yet the"},"3939":{"dur":6,"text":"case. I began working on this film doing some\ninitial research back in 2009. And at that"},"3945":{"dur":5,"text":"time the idea of making a documentary about\ndisability rights was deeply unfashionable."},"3951":{"dur":7,"text":"It\u2019s kind of remained so until really just\nthe last year or so. But along the way I have"},"3958":{"dur":7,"text":"had a lot of support from individuals and\norganisations. But we are still completing"},"3966":{"dur":5,"text":"the film. The film is currently being edited,\nand we're hoping that Screen Australia will"},"3971":{"dur":5,"text":"tip in some funding to allow us to complete\nthe film to a really high standard. If that"},"3976":{"dur":6,"text":"doesn't happen, we will find another way.\nBut fingers very tightly crossed at the moment."},"3982":{"dur":5,"text":"I think that the trailer is a really good\nshowcase for the film. I'm very hopeful that"},"3987":{"dur":5,"text":"the wise people who know nothing about disability\nat Film Australia will actually just love"},"3993":{"dur":5,"text":"it on its own merits as a film. Hopefully\nthe film will be completed very, very soon."},"3999":{"dur":6,"text":"But I just wanted to clarify that it's not\ncompleted. It's a bit of a premiere for the"},"4005":{"dur":7,"text":"trailer here today. Then I will go home and\nput it on YouTube and spread the word. Feel"},"4012":{"dur":6,"text":"free to share it with people. I want people\nto know that the film is coming. The film"},"4018":{"dur":5,"text":"really talks about that journey from institutions\nout into the community. One of the things"},"4024":{"dur":4,"text":"that is actually very difficult about making\na linear narrative film that is a little bit"},"4029":{"dur":6,"text":"easier to do in an exhibition that's not linear\u00a0\nI found that there were certain topics that"},"4035":{"dur":5,"text":"can't be squashed into that linearity. When\nan audience watch a film they expect a story"},"4041":{"dur":6,"text":"with a beginning, middle and end. Inevitably\nthere are themes that I would \u2013 I would"},"4047":{"dur":6,"text":"love to be able to put so many stories into\nthis film. My last screening of a cut\u00a0 I"},"4054":{"dur":6,"text":"got some activists and some film maker friends\nto look at a cut. They just said, \"There is"},"4060":{"dur":5,"text":"too much in there.

But we have to remove things"},"4072":{"dur":5,"text":"to actually make a compelling narrative. But\nwhat we can do today and with this exhibition"},"4077":{"dur":8,"text":"is a lot more of those stories can be told\nin a way that doesn't need to have that kind"},"4086":{"dur":6,"text":"of logic. On the panel today, Joan Hume is\none of the people who appears in the film;"},"4092":{"dur":5,"text":"not in the trailer. You don\u2019t make it into\nthe trailer, but \u2013 I\u2019m not gonna be famous?"},"4098":{"dur":5,"text":"But you are in the film, definitely, Joan.\nI went to Sydney and filmed a wonderful interview"},"4103":{"dur":5,"text":"with Joan. Then we had several good glasses\nof wine afterwards and a bit more chat. You"},"4109":{"dur":8,"text":"really took up the Sydney angle of the anti\nMiss Victoria protests that Lesley got started"},"4117":{"dur":6,"text":"and really took that into Sydney. That was\nsomething - it started here in Melbourne?"},"4123":{"dur":4,"text":"Unfortunately we didn\u2019t get to disrupt the\nmeeting, because they \u2013 the Ms Australia"},"4128":{"dur":8,"text":"quest had already been wised up to the fact\nthat we \u2018can\u2019t allow those radicals in"},"4137":{"dur":3,"text":"the door\u2019, that we were as radical as the\nVictorians. We weren\u2019t even allowed in the"},"4140":{"dur":7,"text":"door, but we had the protest outside where\nthe Miss Australia Quest was being held. This"},"4147":{"dur":12,"text":"is back in 1983. One of the funniest recollections\nwas a\u00a0bus saying \u2018spastic society\u2019 or"},"4159":{"dur":10,"text":"something like that\u00a0pulled up. Out streamed\npeople all dressed up to the 9s in tuxedos,"},"4170":{"dur":7,"text":"women in long flowing gowns. And heaps of\njewellery, sparkling. Extremely able bodied,"},"4178":{"dur":7,"text":"very glitterati-type people. Many of them\nwere dignitaries invited to the event. The"},"4185":{"dur":7,"text":"irony of it was \u2013 here was this bus flashing\nall of these signs saying disabled people,"},"4193":{"dur":4,"text":"handicapped people or whatever the terminology\nwas. I think in those days it was \u2018spastic"},"4197":{"dur":6,"text":"society\u2019. I don\u2019t think the word \u2018retard\u2019\nwas there, but it was probably there in spirit!"},"4203":{"dur":7,"text":"Including my local member\u00a0 who I happened\nto know because he was a local sportsperson"},"4210":{"dur":11,"text":"who had taken out my older sister at one stage.\nI\u00a0was handing out pamphlets.

He looked at pamphlet and said, \"You're\na disgrace!\" I thought, \u2018What have I to"},"4229":{"dur":4,"text":"be disgraceful about?\u201d Anyway, so all of\nthe beautiful people poured out of this bus"},"4234":{"dur":4,"text":"with this sign saying - and not one disabled\nperson was actually on that bus. To me that"},"4239":{"dur":10,"text":"kind of captured the heart of what that campaign\nwas all about. It was kind of a mirror opposite"},"4249":{"dur":7,"text":"of what the disability rights movement \u2013 nothing\nabout us without us. Everything about them"},"4257":{"dur":8,"text":"and nothing about people with disabilities.\nWe could raise money on their behalf, but"},"4265":{"dur":2,"text":"not let them be part of the party.

That kind of message of"},"4312":{"dur":6,"text":"protest that Lesley started, yes, we took\nup, and I think it resulted in a different"},"4318":{"dur":10,"text":"way of fundraising and a different way of\nenabling and encouraging and incorporating"},"4328":{"dur":9,"text":"people with disabilities to make decisions\nabout their own lives. Steve Giani, you have"},"4337":{"dur":5,"text":"been around as an activist for a while on\nthe Melbourne scene. I'm interested to know"},"4343":{"dur":7,"text":"some of the issues and maybe tactics that\nyou would remember as some of the earliest"},"4350":{"dur":4,"text":"things that you were involved in. And what\nwere the issues and what were the tactics"},"4355":{"dur":11,"text":"used? I just wanted to start by saying it's\nwonderful to be here and wonderful to be here"},"4366":{"dur":11,"text":"with all of you. The big thing for me and\nthe place that I started was around trying"},"4378":{"dur":10,"text":"to dismantle and be a part of dismantling\nthe service system model that we had, that"},"4388":{"dur":7,"text":"people with disabilities had in Australia.\nAnd it did start here in Victoria. It was"},"4395":{"dur":8,"text":"really around some key people saying, \u2018We\nwant this thing called attendant care. We"},"4404":{"dur":7,"text":"want people who are working with us in our\nhomes, working with us wherever we are, providing"},"4411":{"dur":9,"text":"us with daily living skills, with reading,\nwith assistance to access goods and services."},"4420":{"dur":8,"text":"All of those things. We want that to become\na part of a natural way of working for Australia"},"4429":{"dur":8,"text":"and for Australians. So, the first thing I\nhad to do was try and learn about that. Because"},"4437":{"dur":7,"text":"I had only just come back from overseas and\nI had been living there for quite a while,"},"4444":{"dur":6,"text":"running my own business. When I got back and\ngot involved in this movement, the movement"},"4450":{"dur":6,"text":"around attendant care, I\u00a0was flabbergasted.\nThere are some people in the room that taught"},"4457":{"dur":7,"text":"me a lot in those days. And some that aren't.\nBut there is one I will tell you a story,"},"4464":{"dur":6,"text":"a very quick story, about one of the women\nwho really helped me understand what attendant"},"4471":{"dur":8,"text":"care meant and how important it was. And if\nthere are children here, I'm sorry, in advance."},"4479":{"dur":6,"text":"A woman called Annie\u00a0McDonald, I\u00a0was told\nto speak to her because I would learn a lot"},"4485":{"dur":6,"text":"more about attendant care and how important\nit was to have a different way of delivering"},"4491":{"dur":7,"text":"services to people outside of institutions\nand institutional care. So I went and met"},"4499":{"dur":7,"text":"Annie or she came to our offices at the then\nAttendant Care Coalition. Annie spoke by touching"},"4507":{"dur":6,"text":"a cardboard board thing that had words and\nletters on it, I think; I don\u2019t see very"},"4513":{"dur":5,"text":"well. So, somewhere is there interpreting\nit for me. I said to Annie, \"Tell me about"},"4519":{"dur":9,"text":"attendant care? What difference has it made\nto your life.\" She just touched out I think"},"4528":{"dur":7,"text":"I said that needed to research it and understand\nit better\u00a0\u2013 and she tapped out, \"I would"},"4535":{"dur":9,"text":"be fucked.\" I said, \u201cOh, great.\u201d \u201cHelp\nme understand what, \u2018I would be fucked\u2019"},"4545":{"dur":6,"text":"means. I still don't quite get attendant care.\nIs it a sexual surrogate thing or whatever?\u2019"},"4552":{"dur":17,"text":"And then she said, \u2018No. They would lock\nme up again.\" And that was\u00a0where my conversation"},"4569":{"dur":8,"text":"with Annie and my thinking began, around what\nit means to have a service system and a model"},"4578":{"dur":8,"text":"that does something other than deal with us\nin an institutional way. No better person"},"4587":{"dur":9,"text":"to teach you than Annie McDonald. He was forthright\nand succinct and she always told it like it"},"4596":{"dur":9,"text":"was. Sue, you are the CEO at Arts Project.\nArts Project has been around a long time supporting"},"4606":{"dur":8,"text":"artists with disability to make art. I\u00a0was\nsaying to you just before that due to a family"},"4614":{"dur":6,"text":"connection I\u00a0was recently at the funeral\nof Leo Cousin, who is one of the most well-known"},"4621":{"dur":4,"text":"artists to come out of Arts Project. The thing\nthat I was particularly interested in with"},"4625":{"dur":3,"text":"Leo \u2013 and you could make this more generally\nabout Arts Project \u2013 but the thing that"},"4628":{"dur":6,"text":"always struck me about Leo and his art and\nfrom his family perspective was that there"},"4634":{"dur":5,"text":"were a number of artists from Arts Project\nAustralia that really moved beyond the disability"},"4640":{"dur":7,"text":"world. And their art spoke to art collectors\nand art lovers around the world. I think there"},"4648":{"dur":4,"text":"was some involvement from Stuart Purvis at\nAustralian Galleries that really brought it"},"4652":{"dur":8,"text":"out from being a disability project to being\ngenuinely about art. I think that's really"},"4660":{"dur":6,"text":"an interesting sort of story and an interesting\nmodel I think for what really disability rights"},"4666":{"dur":6,"text":"wants\u00a0 to be a part of the community. Would\nyou like to talk a little bit about how Arts"},"4673":{"dur":6,"text":"Project fits? Sure. Our founder, who sadly\nI never met, Myra Hilgendorf, was quite an"},"4679":{"dur":6,"text":"extraordinary woman. My involvement with disability\nhas really only been since I came to Arts"},"4686":{"dur":9,"text":"Project for the past six years. I have learnt\nso much in that time. Myra had a daughter"},"4696":{"dur":6,"text":"Joanna who had a fairly profound intellectual\ndisability. Myra was an artist herself and"},"4703":{"dur":11,"text":"thought the art that Joanna was creating was\nreally valid and great art. It was back in"},"4714":{"dur":7,"text":"the 70s. We're 41 years old this year. So,\nshe gathered, as people do\u00a0 a group of like-minded"},"4721":{"dur":3,"text":"people around her and went and knocked on\nthe doors of the art professors at universities"},"4725":{"dur":6,"text":"and said, \"Look. Put it all on the floor.\nI want you to have a look at this. Tell me"},"4731":{"dur":5,"text":"what you think of this.\" And got a real groundswell\nof support. For the first probably 10 years"},"4736":{"dur":7,"text":"of Arts Project Australia it was simply about\nartwork made by people with intellectual disabilities"},"4744":{"dur":6,"text":"being exhibited and curated in a professional\nmanner. That collection is about 400 or 500"},"4750":{"dur":5,"text":"works. There were three exhibitions in that\ntime. Myra is one of the people I want to"},"4756":{"dur":7,"text":"put on the digital history roll. But then\nthe next person I would like to put on is"},"4763":{"dur":5,"text":"our founding director Cheryl Day, who was\na member of that committee and an art teacher"},"4769":{"dur":2,"text":"at Janefield. When you look \u2013 we still have\nthis collection of work. When you look at"},"4772":{"dur":7,"text":"it today, number 1, mostly the last name of\nthe artist is never included in the art work"},"4779":{"dur":7,"text":"for fear of embarrassing their family. Number\n2, it's deteriorating, because they are really"},"4787":{"dur":6,"text":"crappy materials\u00a0that the art work has been\nmade with. That is because mostly they were"},"4793":{"dur":5,"text":"made by people who were in institutions and\nmostly it wasn't deemed to be a profitable"},"4799":{"dur":8,"text":"or worthwhile activity. Cheryl said, \"Let's\nstart our own studio and make one of the philosophies"},"4807":{"dur":5,"text":"good-quality materials.\u201d That's number 1.\nNumber 2, \u201cWe won't teach anyone to do anything."},"4813":{"dur":6,"text":"They will make art the way they want to make\nart.\u201d It started slowly.

In that community, many people have\nbegun to step up and have their voices heard."},"4894":{"dur":6,"text":"I knew Stella very well for many years. We\nworked very closely together. But there was"},"4900":{"dur":4,"text":"a point where it was like there was only one\nvoice for disability in our media, and that"},"4905":{"dur":8,"text":"was Stella's voice.

I'm not in any way trying"},"4917":{"dur":8,"text":"to present that as a plus, but I\u2019ve noticed\nthere's a lot more diversity of voices. So"},"4926":{"dur":7,"text":"that's one thing. But the other is\u00a0 Katharine,\nI'm interested to know for you and your peers"},"4933":{"dur":5,"text":"what you feel the issues are. We have heard\nabout the NDIS, but really that's just the"},"4938":{"dur":8,"text":"tip of the iceberg.

NDIS"},"4968":{"dur":7,"text":"is currently a solution to an economic problem.\nWe have not really seen the social impacts"},"4975":{"dur":8,"text":"of the NDIS at all yet.

I think that's a"},"4999":{"dur":7,"text":"challenge for the future.
