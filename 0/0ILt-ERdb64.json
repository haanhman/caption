But this is a challenge from our end."},"1227":{"dur":4,"text":"In that as we participate in these messed up places, we're all over the place. We're on mobile"},"1231":{"dur":3,"text":"devices, we're on learning management systems, we're on student information systems, blogs, and social media,"},"1235":{"dur":4,"text":"is that these knowledge elements, for us to understand as educators,"},"1239":{"dur":4,"text":"did students understand the topics we taught? They're analytically cloaked."},"1243":{"dur":4,"text":"Because they're scattered in a variety of different databases."},"1247":{"dur":4,"text":"They're scattered in a variety of different logs. More importantly"},"1251":{"dur":4,"text":"is from an analytic stance, we have a lot of trouble actually getting at that"},"1255":{"dur":4,"text":"analytics work because a large portion of what happened in a classroom actually"},"1259":{"dur":4,"text":"doesn't happen in a classroom. Even a large portion of what happens"},"1263":{"dur":4,"text":"online doesn't happen online in terms of learning. So you might have them in your learning"},"1268":{"dur":4,"text":"management system, but they might have a chat window open, or they might be active on Skype. Or they"},"1272":{"dur":4,"text":"might be participating in a Google hangout. So with these various tools, we have to"},"1276":{"dur":4,"text":"start conceiving a model of analytics that goes beyond easy data capture"},"1280":{"dur":4,"text":"to a model that starts to consider the breadth and the scope of analytics broadly."},"1284":{"dur":4,"text":"Now I want to look briefly at a few examples of what some"},"1288":{"dur":4,"text":"universities have done with analytics. A few of these you probably heard already."},"1292":{"dur":4,"text":"One is Purdue Signals. So Purdue Signals has gotten a lot of attention. It's one of"},"1296":{"dur":4,"text":"the first tools available. Simple approach. They take a variety of data"},"1300":{"dur":4,"text":"elements and they basically assign to a student. They're either green, they're"},"1305":{"dur":4,"text":"yellow, or they're red. If you're green, that means you're great, you're doing fine. If you"},"1309":{"dur":4,"text":"got a yellow, then you need to start thinking about what you're doing in the course. They might give you"},"1313":{"dur":4,"text":"some advice or guidelines. And it you're red, there are certain specific steps you might need to take to get help"},"1317":{"dur":4,"text":"beyond that. You also have initiatives such as"},"1321":{"dur":4,"text":"the Open Learning Initiative, which emphasizes the use of cognitive tutors."},"1325":{"dur":4,"text":"So cognitive tutors play a critical role"},"1329":{"dur":4,"text":"in helping students come to understand a topic. Rather than a faculty"},"1333":{"dur":4,"text":"member teaching, the tutor itself recognizes what the student"},"1337":{"dur":4,"text":"has done. And I use that...I don't want to anthropomorphize tutors, but they don't really recognize"},"1342":{"dur":4,"text":"but they...the tutors guide students based on"},"1346":{"dur":4,"text":"what it is that students have displayed in recent performance or recent activity."},"1350":{"dur":4,"text":"And that will determine what do they need to know next? Or have they conceptually"},"1354":{"dur":4,"text":"misunderstood the topic, so that they can then provide pointed feedback."},"1358":{"dur":4,"text":"Another illustration is Degree Compass. Degree Compass"},"1362":{"dur":4,"text":"is basically a recommender system. Much like what Netflix or Amazon has done with"},"1366":{"dur":4,"text":"their systems. It just basically allows individuals to be able to"},"1370":{"dur":4,"text":"choose or at least be advised which course they would most likely"},"1374":{"dur":4,"text":"be most successful at. Now this is...keep in mind when we're talking about analytics,"},"1379":{"dur":4,"text":"especially predictive models, we're not talking about this is what thou shalt do."},"1383":{"dur":4,"text":"There's always a margin of error any time you start interacting with a probabilistic model."},"1387":{"dur":4,"text":"But it's just basically saying, all things considered what we know about you, this is what would be best for you"},"1391":{"dur":4,"text":"in terms of the next course to take. Or an illustration like this, this is an"},"1395":{"dur":4,"text":"example of a tool that conducts social network"},"1399":{"dur":4,"text":"analysis of how individuals are connected to one another in a discussion form."},"1403":{"dur":4,"text":"And in this particular research activity, Dossman-McFadden, what"},"1407":{"dur":4,"text":"they wanted to look at specifically was what's the impact of being disconnected"},"1411":{"dur":4,"text":"from the primary social circles of interaction. If you're one of the students on the top"},"1416":{"dur":4,"text":"left corner, or one of the student down toward the bottom of the diagram that just"},"1420":{"dur":4,"text":"has a few connections or that is completely disconnected, what is that?"},"1424":{"dur":4,"text":"lack of integration with a broader community in that course? What's the impact"},"1428":{"dur":4,"text":"of that in your eventual grades? Or can we even determine the"},"1432":{"dur":4,"text":"impact? Maybe at this point we're likely more talking just correlations if that."},"1436":{"dur":4,"text":"But it's coming to understand everything that students do from how they share an idea to how"},"1440":{"dur":4,"text":"interact with one another and what that means ultimately in terms of how can"},"1444":{"dur":4,"text":"we better advise or better direct students to success?"},"1449":{"dur":4,"text":"Variety of initiatives for analytics, such as Rio Salado, are able"},"1453":{"dur":4,"text":"through predictive models to determine early in a course whether or not a student will fail"},"1457":{"dur":4,"text":"or pass. Their statement is around seventy plus percent"},"1461":{"dur":4,"text":"accuracy rate, they'll be able to tell you within just over the first week of the course,"},"1465":{"dur":4,"text":"whether or not a student will eventually complete that course successfully."},"1469":{"dur":4,"text":"By the same account they've used an analytic model that allows various individuals across"},"1473":{"dur":4,"text":"the system to be notified of any tutor or additional support help that they might need."},"1477":{"dur":4,"text":"Whether it's from their adviser, from faculty, or some other level of support. So it's"},"1481":{"dur":4,"text":"really about taking what do we know about the students then adding a support layer on top of that."},"1486":{"dur":4,"text":"Other examples, and this comes from that whole field of nudging."},"1490":{"dur":3,"text":"Where we want to influence and direct student behavior. Persistence Plus"},"1494":{"dur":4,"text":"is another illustration. Now this isn't...with these kinds of programs I want to emphasize"},"1498":{"dur":4,"text":"these are very much stage one programs where were still"},"1502":{"dur":4,"text":"trying to take what we understand at some level from research, either"},"1506":{"dur":4,"text":"in analytics, or data analytics, data mining broadly,"},"1510":{"dur":4,"text":"and trying to translate that into the education space. So Persistence"},"1514":{"dur":4,"text":"Plus is just a simple example of a way that you nudge students when you start to see"},"1518":{"dur":4,"text":"certain behavior patterns that maybe aren't ideal or you want to say, hey,"},"1522":{"dur":4,"text":"how are things going today? We just want to check in. And what you can see happening"},"1526":{"dur":4,"text":"here is they're simply collecting data. They're adding a data layer because they don't have access"},"1530":{"dur":4,"text":"to that now. So that's the"},"1535":{"dur":4,"text":"broad overview in the context of a few of the aspects of analytics. And now I want to dive into"},"1539":{"dur":4,"text":"more specifically, what does this look like if you were to deploy or sort of move in"},"1543":{"dur":4,"text":"analytics model at Penn State, for example? What would the impact"},"1547":{"dur":3,"text":"or what might an analytics model be like? And what role might it play in terms of"},"1551":{"dur":4,"text":"improving teaching and learning? So I'm gonna run through a series of six different"},"1555":{"dur":4,"text":"elements on this. First of all, I spent a lot of time chatting about"},"1559":{"dur":4,"text":"this so I'm not gonna get into great detail, but we leave data trails wherever we go."},"1563":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean, on a daily basis every log in, with mobile"},"1568":{"dur":4,"text":"devices, even our movements are being tracked. So it's really about looking at that"},"1572":{"dur":4,"text":"range of data trails. Whether it's physical data or whether it's data that we just have access"},"1576":{"dur":4,"text":"to because it's sitting in a log somewhere."},"1580":{"dur":4,"text":"This is peripheral. Not yet integrated. But we'll bring it"},"1584":{"dur":4,"text":"together later. The second aspect relates to what I demonstrated earlier around how"},"1588":{"dur":4,"text":"fields of knowledge and disciplines are connected and related. A student that is said to be"},"1592":{"dur":4,"text":"educated in a discipline is one that would be able to explain how are pieces related"},"1596":{"dur":4,"text":"and what's the impact if you adjust or change any of those pieces?"},"1600":{"dur":4,"text":"And so that's essentially from a semantic web perspective. What the intent"},"1604":{"dur":4,"text":"is to create a structure of related knowledge. How are pieces related to one another?"},"1608":{"dur":4,"text":"So at this point machine readable content is basically content that the computer"},"1613":{"dur":4,"text":"system is able to define and say this is how these pieces are connected."},"1617":{"dur":4,"text":"Once we have the student profile and we have how the pieces are connected,"},"1621":{"dur":4,"text":"we start to generate, sort of, a richer structure of the impact of the student."},"1625":{"dur":4,"text":"We end up doing some level of analysis on that then. Because we now"},"1629":{"dur":4,"text":"know this is what a student should know in this field. This is what the student currently"},"1633":{"dur":4,"text":"knows based on data that we're collecting. And through a variety of analysis approaches"},"1638":{"dur":4,"text":"huge range, I've just thrown a few up, but conceptual analysis, network analysis,"},"1642":{"dur":4,"text":"we might look at discourse analysis. How do people engage"},"1646":{"dur":4,"text":"in conversations? What's the impact of a rhetorical move in terms of changing a students mind?"},"1650":{"dur":4,"text":"What is the logic that's being exhibited as students interact with"},"1654":{"dur":4,"text":"one another. And so the consequence of this analysis we end up to something that looks like"},"1658":{"dur":4,"text":"a prediction. And that prediction then gives us some insight into either"},"1662":{"dur":4,"text":"we need to do something different with this student. You know, we either need to"},"1666":{"dur":4,"text":"intervene.  We need to give them some additional support because they're at risk of"},"1670":{"dur":4,"text":"dropping out. Perhaps we can personalize the learning experience. We can give"},"1674":{"dur":4,"text":"them a custom set of content elements that"},"1678":{"dur":4,"text":"address the knowledge gaps that they exhibit. Or perhaps we can give"},"1682":{"dur":4,"text":"them, based on content they've recently mastered, the next level of logical"},"1686":{"dur":4,"text":"content that they need to engage in. And so from a prediction end, we eventually move"},"1691":{"dur":4,"text":"to something either pedagogical adoption or adaptation"},"1695":{"dur":4,"text":"or we move to something that functions more on trying to encourage greater social"},"1699":{"dur":4,"text":"cohesiveness. Because not everything can be corrected technologically. A large part of"},"1703":{"dur":4,"text":"what goes on from a student perspective, and by corrected technologically, I mean, it's...not everything"},"1707":{"dur":4,"text":"can be an alert that says, oh, you're feeling sad today, you should be happy."},"1711":{"dur":4,"text":"In some cases it requires actually connecting that student to a social"},"1715":{"dur":4,"text":"system or getting that student involved in a broader social conversation or social"},"1720":{"dur":4,"text":"interaction. So here's another way of looking at something"},"1724":{"dur":4,"text":"similar. From an analytics model. So I'm not gonna go into enormous"},"1728":{"dur":4,"text":"detail on all of these elements, but I just want to emphasize from the universities"},"1732":{"dur":4,"text":"perspective, as you're collecting data from a range of different sources,"},"1736":{"dur":4,"text":"you end up with something that looks like a central analytics engine where you have"},"1740":{"dur":4,"text":"a variety of metrics and techniques. And these can include things such as"},"1744":{"dur":4,"text":"you're conceptual analysis. It can also include things where"},"1748":{"dur":4,"text":"you want to spend time, let's say, conducting social network structure view."},"1753":{"dur":4,"text":"You want to look at discourse. Or even sense making models. What are the kind of cognitive"},"1757":{"dur":4,"text":"models that students use in different kinds of settings and different kinds of approaches?"},"1761":{"dur":4,"text":"The research in this area that goes"},"1765":{"dur":4,"text":"really back to the 60's and even the early 70's already looked at how"},"1769":{"dur":4,"text":"can you take the experiences that individuals have as they"},"1774":{"dur":4,"text":"interact with the technology system? And what options do you have then to take"},"1778":{"dur":4,"text":"those experiences and adjust them based on either personal preference or perhaps,"},"1782":{"dur":4,"text":"more importantly, based on personal need? You know, what is it that a student might need that they might"},"1786":{"dur":4,"text":"not even be aware of that they need? Because in many instances in education, it's not"},"1790":{"dur":4,"text":"always what we do that we think is good for us, but it's what a faculty member can identify"},"1794":{"dur":4,"text":"and draw to our attention that becomes critical. So, with"},"1798":{"dur":4,"text":"this central analytics engine, the arrange of approaches that are being conducted are"},"1802":{"dur":4,"text":"being evaluated on the students, then lead, as I've already talked about,"},"1806":{"dur":4,"text":"into the intervention engine, which in turn is well correlated"},"1810":{"dur":4,"text":"to what's happening from the student's perspective in terms of adapting"},"1814":{"dur":4,"text":"and changing the course experience. The adaptive aspect of learning"},"1819":{"dur":4,"text":"is one that's receiving an enormous amount of interest and to some cases actually"},"1823":{"dur":4,"text":"fairly unnerving. There's an organization recently funded by Gates"},"1827":{"dur":4,"text":"Foundation. I think a hundred million dollars was put into it called In Bloom, which basically"},"1831":{"dur":4,"text":"helps local school systems start to provide personalization and"},"1835":{"dur":4,"text":"personal content for their students. There's other foundations that committed as well."},"1840":{"dur":4,"text":"But essentially it will take an enormous amount of student data"},"1844":{"dur":4,"text":"suck it out from local regional school systems and use it to create"},"1848":{"dur":4,"text":"informed and ongoing learning models, which we'll then take the data that's produced from"},"1852":{"dur":4,"text":"that and generate a personal or recommender systems to students"},"1856":{"dur":4,"text":"more locally. So it takes the benefit of large scale personalization adaptivity"},"1860":{"dur":4,"text":"and hopefully impacts the quality of experience for each student."},"1864":{"dur":4,"text":"For a lot of cases, from a faculty end as well, the question"},"1868":{"dur":4,"text":"starts to arise as to what's the value of this and the actual impact on it?"},"1873":{"dur":4,"text":"Because we're now starting to do huge experimentation on students that we"},"1877":{"dur":4,"text":"don't necessarily have a full awareness of what the actual impact of that is. So if you have"},"1881":{"dur":4,"text":"students, for example, that you want, oh, let's try this, I don't know, whole"},"1885":{"dur":4,"text":"language learning thing on them and see what the outcome is. These kinds of projects"},"1889":{"dur":4,"text":"can take years to have an impact. In some cases decades. And so we're at a similar"},"1893":{"dur":4,"text":"stage from an analytics end. It's aligning very nicely with standardized testing."},"1898":{"dur":4,"text":"It's aligning very nicely with some of the challenges that we hear about the"},"1902":{"dur":4,"text":"weakness of the existing school system. So it's, sort of, this is an easy fix. We'll just add"},"1906":{"dur":4,"text":"analytics, maybe a MOOC or two, and we'll have solved education's problems."},"1910":{"dur":4,"text":"And so from that end there's a lot from the analytics dimension"},"1914":{"dur":4,"text":"that holds enormous potential, but there's as much from the societal"},"1918":{"dur":4,"text":"and privacy concern perspective that faculty members need to devote a lot of time"},"1922":{"dur":4,"text":"to thinking and trying to figure out as well. So the in theory, at least,"},"1926":{"dur":4,"text":"the model looks something like this. Setting aside the social concerns, and I'll dive into"},"1930":{"dur":4,"text":"that in just a minute. So the model looks"},"1934":{"dur":4,"text":"along the lines of a learner who's acquiring knowledge either through formal and informal means."},"1938":{"dur":4,"text":"Some of the most dramatic aspects of educational change"},"1942":{"dur":4,"text":"now aren't even in the MOOC format that you're hearing a lot of talk about. They're"},"1946":{"dur":4,"text":"actually in those activities that are starting to granularize the education experience."},"1950":{"dur":4,"text":"The University of Wisconsin is one example, where they've started to"},"1955":{"dur":4,"text":"move to a competency based model. You can get a bachelor's degree without ever"},"1959":{"dur":4,"text":"stepping into a university campus. And a lot of systems,"},"1963":{"dur":4,"text":"university in particular, they already have structures in place."},"1967":{"dur":4,"text":"Depending what the language you use, prior learning assessment and recognition, PLR,"},"1971":{"dur":4,"text":"PLA, any concept of that that says we want to look at what do students"},"1975":{"dur":4,"text":"learn outside of a classroom setting? And how can we fill the gaps"},"1979":{"dur":4,"text":"that they have? Because quite honestly a student that"},"1984":{"dur":4,"text":"spent their summer between graduating high school and going to the university volunteering,"},"1988":{"dur":4,"text":"is going to have a different knowledge profile than a student that spent their summer playing video games."},"1992":{"dur":4,"text":"A student that's been involved in community work or in sporting activities"},"1996":{"dur":4,"text":"since they were, you know, five years old are similarly going to have a different kind of"},"2000":{"dur":4,"text":"knowledge structure and knowledge profile. So from the perspective of a university"},"2004":{"dur":4,"text":"taking these students in, the ability to evaluate that"},"2008":{"dur":4,"text":"profile, not just what they did while they were in our walls,"},"2012":{"dur":4,"text":"or within the campus area, but really broadly. What have they acquired for knowledge skills"},"2016":{"dur":4,"text":"and competence through a range of different activities over the course of their life?"},"2020":{"dur":4,"text":"There's obviously data ownership issues. There's issues about intrusion. It raises a huge array"},"2024":{"dur":4,"text":"of questions as well about should students have their own data locker that they"},"2028":{"dur":4,"text":"take with them if they start at Penn State and then they go, I don't know, send them up to Canada, they go"},"2032":{"dur":4,"text":"to Athabasca University? Who owns the data that they generated"},"2036":{"dur":4,"text":"while they were here? Is that student data? Or is that institutional data? So these are questions"},"2041":{"dur":4,"text":"that also need to be looked at. The other aspect, I've already touched on, is about the"},"2045":{"dur":4,"text":"architecture of knowledge in a discipline. If you can map our knowledge in a space"},"2049":{"dur":4,"text":"then essentially credentialing becomes as simple as"},"2053":{"dur":4,"text":"comparing student profile with the architecture of the structure of"},"2057":{"dur":4,"text":"knowledge in a space. I mean, obviously, making that happen requires a lot of additional"},"2061":{"dur":4,"text":"work behind the scenes, but that's as simple as it is. But I would argue it's a far more effective"},"2065":{"dur":4,"text":"credentialing system than what we have today as well. Particularly"},"2069":{"dur":4,"text":"one of the biggest benefits here is that if you have a group of, let's say you take a"},"2074":{"dur":4,"text":"twenty-five students in a classroom, and all twenty-five"},"2078":{"dur":4,"text":"students will come into that classroom with a different structure of knowledge."},"2082":{"dur":4,"text":"One of the huge benefits of social learning, and this is what Coursera"},"2086":{"dur":4,"text":"has revealed on many levels to faculty who have already taught in this system, one of the"},"2090":{"dur":4,"text":"big benefits of a system like Coursera is that you are able to"},"2094":{"dur":4,"text":"fill each others knowledge gaps as students. So if you have a hundred people"},"2098":{"dur":4,"text":"the faculty member is likely more aware of the topic"},"2102":{"dur":4,"text":"than anyone of those one hundred people. But once you take those"},"2106":{"dur":4,"text":"hundred people and you connect them socially or technologically in the right way, all of"},"2110":{"dur":4,"text":"sudden the knowledge capacity of those one hundred students exceeds the knowledge capacity"},"2114":{"dur":4,"text":"with the faculty member. So that's essentially, sort of, the model of moving from"},"2118":{"dur":4,"text":"this discreet, kind of, we analyze students based on these proxy measures to"},"2123":{"dur":4,"text":"we do a more direct analysis of students based on what they know and what's evidenced in their activities."},"2127":{"dur":4,"text":"A lot of things I've already heard talked about at the conference here around the use of badges."},"2131":{"dur":4,"text":"relates very well to that kind of model or approach. You know, more authentic"},"2135":{"dur":4,"text":"approach to understanding what's happening with students. Now"},"2139":{"dur":4,"text":"as we're moving onto just a couple of final points then, the aspect"},"2143":{"dur":4,"text":"of this conversation that's still most up in the air, is privacy and ethics."},"2147":{"dur":4,"text":"There's a lot that we can do with analytics that we"},"2152":{"dur":4,"text":"haven't spent time thinking about what are the implications on that. And in some cases it can"},"2156":{"dur":4,"text":"be argued that the students that are most at risk are the ones that we most"},"2160":{"dur":4,"text":"need their data to be able to understand what can we do and how can we help them? So you actually"},"2164":{"dur":4,"text":"end up having a bit of an economic divide. Where you can only be anonymous if you"},"2168":{"dur":4,"text":"are wealthy enough not to need help from the system. Or if you can take care of yourself"},"2172":{"dur":4,"text":"in that regard. But those students who are at risk or high needs, those are the students that we"},"2176":{"dur":4,"text":"most aggressively want to collect their data. Because that's what helps us understand what we"},"2180":{"dur":4,"text":"can do to intervene. Your socioeconomic status can make a difference in how you do in the university."},"2184":{"dur":4,"text":"So the privacy questions are enormous. And on some level this may end up"},"2188":{"dur":4,"text":"coming out as a transactional concept. Much like we do with money."},"2192":{"dur":4,"text":"You know, if we use money as a"},"2196":{"dur":4,"text":"transactional agent. You have something I want. I define it"},"2201":{"dur":4,"text":"to a suitable value. You know, we exchange money for product or service."},"2205":{"dur":4,"text":"In contrast, I think data, when a student comes to Penn State"},"2209":{"dur":4,"text":"may well be treated the same way. Where a student sits down and you let the student know, alright,"},"2213":{"dur":4,"text":"if you give us access to your data and if you allow us to analyze your data, we'll be able to provide you with"},"2217":{"dur":4,"text":"better customized service. We'll be able to provide you with intervention. We'll be able to provide you with"},"2221":{"dur":4,"text":"counseling support, because we'll know you better as a student. And from a student end it's"},"2225":{"dur":4,"text":"as simple as, sort of, ticking off that box and saying, yeah, that's a fair exchange."},"2229":{"dur":4,"text":"You know, as my data for better services. We already do it with Facebook or other social"},"2234":{"dur":4,"text":"media platforms. You let me use the system, you do a better job of guiding or teaching"},"2238":{"dur":4,"text":"me, and that seems to be a reasonable approach in that end. So from an educational component,"},"2242":{"dur":4,"text":"when you start thinking systemic learning analytics deployment, that maybe a fair transaction on the part"},"2246":{"dur":4,"text":"of student, but it still doesn't address those"},"2250":{"dur":4,"text":"more uncomfortable questions of analytics. There's a report or"},"2254":{"dur":4,"text":"paper released last week that look at"},"2258":{"dur":4,"text":"through Facebook, through analysis of just your patterns of liking"},"2262":{"dur":4,"text":"things, researchers can determine an awful lot about you"},"2266":{"dur":4,"text":"that you probably aren't aware that they're determining. Such as sexual"},"2270":{"dur":4,"text":"orientation. Such as preferences that you might have in terms of art"},"2274":{"dur":4,"text":"or entertainment or culture. These are things that you never have had to explicitly stated but"},"2279":{"dur":4,"text":"the researchers through analysis of your like patterns can understand a lot"},"2283":{"dur":4,"text":"more about you than you think that they have access to. So that raises a critical concern as well."},"2287":{"dur":4,"text":"How well can we understand our students? There's"},"2291":{"dur":4,"text":"a paper, not a paper, but a presentation where Eric Schmidt"},"2295":{"dur":4,"text":"was talking at a conference, and he was the CEO of Google at the time,"},"2299":{"dur":4,"text":"and he said, you know, we're at the stage now, we were sitting around a room, that's when"},"2303":{"dur":4,"text":"Sergey Brin, and Larry Page, when the three of them were running Google, and he said, we're at a stage now"},"2307":{"dur":4,"text":"where we can predict the stock market. We know"},"2311":{"dur":4,"text":"what's going to happen in the stock market tomorrow. And then he said, then we stopped and we"},"2315":{"dur":4,"text":"pulled back and we said, but that's illegal. And I think"},"2319":{"dur":4,"text":"in the analytic space, educationally at least, we haven't quite got to a sense of,"},"2324":{"dur":4,"text":"what is that point where we cross the privacy threshold?
