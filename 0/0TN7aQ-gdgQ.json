participate."},"743":{"dur":5,"text":"There's less direction from the front in the\nworship, if I can say it that way.Scott HorrellRight.Darrell"},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"BockThat's where the liturgy comes from, that\nkind of thing, because, as we're going to"},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"be talking about shortly, when we think about\nthe Roman Catholic Church in particular and"},"756":{"dur":5,"text":"its theology and the way in which the church\nat least mediates or directs in the salvation"},"762":{"dur":6,"text":"process and in the service, this leads to\na sense in

what to expect from church\nto church, even within the same denomination."},"814":{"dur":7,"text":"But that is also key is the function of the\nactual church leader, the priest or the

that leader.Darrell BockAnd this leads"},"829":{"dur":4,"text":"to the idea that the church is the true church\nbecause of the way in which the minister \u2013 how"},"834":{"dur":6,"text":"I'm going to say it is mediates and provides\naccess to grace or to blessing \u2013 Michael"},"841":{"dur":2,"text":"SvigelThat's right.Darrell Bock\u2013 in a way\nthat, generally speaking, you don't hear about"},"843":{"dur":3,"text":"in Protestant Church, generally speaking.Scott\nHorrellWe might add one other thing, and that"},"846":{"dur":1,"text":"is the issue of accountability."},"848":{"dur":5,"text":"In the high church, there's a very tight accountability\non through the hierarchy."},"854":{"dur":4,"text":"In the low church \u2013 and that can describe\nmany different kinds of different denominations"},"859":{"dur":3,"text":"as well as independent churches."},"862":{"dur":3,"text":"There are varying degrees of accountability;\nsome hardly any accountability at all."},"865":{"dur":6,"text":"It all orients around the man of God, or the\npastor, so to speak, who \u2013 around which"},"871":{"dur":1,"text":"the congregation
