today."},"58":{"dur":3,"text":"So the aim of this talk is\ngive you a bit of an idea"},"62":{"dur":3,"text":"of what my research is about\nand that it is very difficult"},"66":{"dur":2,"text":"because people like me, we like\nto write very long equations"},"70":{"dur":2,"text":"and ideally we like to\nhide behind these equations"},"72":{"dur":2,"text":"and to stand at sight and\njust look at the equation"},"74":{"dur":1,"text":"and work it out for yourself."},"76":{"dur":2,"text":"So unfortunately today\nI'm not allowed to do this"},"78":{"dur":3,"text":"because if I write down a one\nvery long equation then they're"},"81":{"dur":2,"text":"not very many people who would\nappreciate that very much."},"84":{"dur":5,"text":"So, I need to give you a\nbit of a historical overview"},"89":{"dur":5,"text":"of why I do what I do and I\ntry to sort of motivate why we,"},"95":{"dur":3,"text":"humans in general, do\nthese kinds of activities"},"99":{"dur":2,"text":"which in my case is\ntheoretical physics"},"101":{"dur":2,"text":"but very much motivated by--"},"104":{"dur":3,"text":"in parts at least by\nastrophysics, I would say."},"108":{"dur":3,"text":"So, what I want to talk about is\nI want to give you a little bit"},"112":{"dur":3,"text":"of a short overview of gravity,\nof the theory of gravity"},"116":{"dur":4,"text":"and what we have done over the\nlast few thousand years to come"},"120":{"dur":2,"text":"to the theory that\nwe now call gravity."},"124":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think the best\nway to start this is"},"127":{"dur":2,"text":"if you go back a\nfew thousand years,"},"130":{"dur":3,"text":"people were always really\ninterested in the night sky"},"134":{"dur":2,"text":"and I think all of you have\ndone this at some point,"},"136":{"dur":1,"text":"it was very dark you went\noutside and you looked"},"138":{"dur":2,"text":"up in the sky and you found\nit terribly fascinating."},"141":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is the fascination\nthat I think humans have shared"},"145":{"dur":2,"text":"for thousands-- ten\nthousands of years probably."},"148":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is what has motivated\nus to develop theories"},"152":{"dur":3,"text":"and develop an understanding\nof the night sky I suppose."},"156":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you look back, I think\nthe Babylonians were the first"},"159":{"dur":3,"text":"ones to be quite\nserious about astronomy"},"162":{"dur":3,"text":"and astronomy observation,\nastronomy, I should say."},"166":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'll show you a few\npictures about this in a minute."},"168":{"dur":2,"text":"But I will also talk\nabout general relativity"},"171":{"dur":2,"text":"which is Einstein's Theory of\nRelativity that he proposed"},"174":{"dur":3,"text":"in 1916, and that\nfundamentally changed our view"},"177":{"dur":2,"text":"of the gravitational force."},"180":{"dur":3,"text":"And as the host said,\nI've recently moved to--"},"183":{"dur":2,"text":"over the few years I also\nworked in continuum mechanics."},"186":{"dur":2,"text":"So what is this continuum\nmechanics, it's not something"},"189":{"dur":1,"text":"that you learn in school."},"191":{"dur":5,"text":"So continuum mechanics is\nabout modeling materials"},"197":{"dur":1,"text":"and you don't want to model them"},"198":{"dur":2,"text":"as point particles\nstuck together."},"201":{"dur":3,"text":"You want to model them\nas one continuous medium."},"204":{"dur":1,"text":"A good example is an\nelastic rubber band."},"207":{"dur":3,"text":"If you try to model an elastic\nrubber band by individual points"},"211":{"dur":1,"text":"and that doesn't quite work."},"212":{"dur":2,"text":"So, the molecules are stuck\ntogether and they sort"},"214":{"dur":1,"text":"of function as a\ncontinuous medium."},"217":{"dur":3,"text":"And one of the very important\naspects of continuum mechanics"},"220":{"dur":2,"text":"as this rubber band\nindicates is something"},"223":{"dur":1,"text":"that people call elasticity."},"225":{"dur":2,"text":"So, while you study\nthe bending of objects."},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you think this is\nsort of highly academic,"},"230":{"dur":1,"text":"so it can be terribly important."},"232":{"dur":2,"text":"A very good example for\na very useful application"},"234":{"dur":3,"text":"of this elasticity\ntheory is, for instance,"},"238":{"dur":1,"text":"if you build airplanes."},"239":{"dur":3,"text":"So the next time you get onto\nan airplane, watch the wings"},"243":{"dur":2,"text":"of an airplane during\ntake off for instance."},"246":{"dur":0,"text":"They're not static."},"247":{"dur":1,"text":"They actually flop very gently."},"249":{"dur":1,"text":"The flopping is not\nwhat takes you"},"250":{"dur":1,"text":"up in the air, that's the birds."},"253":{"dur":1,"text":"[laughter] But they\nflip very gently."},"255":{"dur":2,"text":"And if they were not flopping\nthey would just break off"},"258":{"dur":1,"text":"and that would be really bad."},"260":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's very good that objects\nlike plane wings are elastic,"},"263":{"dur":3,"text":"because without this elasticity,\nthings will actually not work."},"267":{"dur":1,"text":"And our world is actually--"},"268":{"dur":1,"text":"there are many things\nin elasticity"},"269":{"dur":2,"text":"which are terribly\nimportant form particular"},"272":{"dur":1,"text":"for engineering purposes."},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"Then I decided, I want\nto give you something"},"276":{"dur":1,"text":"that you can take\nhome and tell friends"},"278":{"dur":2,"text":"if they ask you what\nhave you done today"},"280":{"dur":1,"text":"or what have you learned\ntoday, anything interesting,"},"282":{"dur":1,"text":"or what have you\ndone during lunch,"},"284":{"dur":2,"text":"and I want to give you two\nquestions you can take away"},"287":{"dur":0,"text":"and you can think about"},"288":{"dur":1,"text":"and these are questions\nI'm thinking about."},"290":{"dur":2,"text":"So, one of those question is,\nis the universe a crystal?"},"293":{"dur":1,"text":"Sounds like a very odd question."},"295":{"dur":3,"text":"But this is roughly\nspeaking what I'm working on."},"300":{"dur":4,"text":"And someone who is with me\nwith this is my PhD student"},"304":{"dur":1,"text":"from the very first row here,\nNicole Arend [phonetic]."},"306":{"dur":1,"text":"He works heavily\non this with me."},"308":{"dur":2,"text":"And other way to put\nthis is a question is,"},"310":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Does the universe have\nan internal structure?\""},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"So what do I mean\nby these questions?"},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"What do I mean by the question\nas, \"Is the universe a crystal?\""},"318":{"dur":3,"text":"It's an odd question to us\nbecause how can it be a crystal."},"322":{"dur":1,"text":"It doesn't look like a crystal."},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean if you look out in\nthe sky you see sort of dots"},"326":{"dur":3,"text":"which you call stars and then\nthere's not much in between them"},"330":{"dur":1,"text":"if you don't use telescope."},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"So what I mean by\ncrystal is sort of--"},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll explain this a bit\nlater, but what I mean"},"337":{"dur":4,"text":"by an internal structures, when\nwe say something like vacuum"},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"or emptiness, we\ntry to say nothing."},"343":{"dur":0,"text":"This is nothing."},"345":{"dur":1,"text":"But more than physics has shown"},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"that this nothing is\nactually not nothing."},"348":{"dur":1,"text":"There's a lot of\nstuff going on there."},"350":{"dur":2,"text":"So for those of you who have\nset of sort of particle physics"},"353":{"dur":3,"text":"or quantum field theory, in\nthese theories you can show"},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"that the vacuum is actually\nfull of life, not real life,"},"359":{"dur":1,"text":"but there's physics going on,"},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"or the famous Hawking black\nRolaid radiation is only"},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"possible because the vacuum\nis not really the vacuum."},"366":{"dur":0,"text":"There is stuff there."},"367":{"dur":3,"text":"Out of nothing you can create\ntwo particles, a particle"},"370":{"dur":2,"text":"and an empty particle, and\nthey can destroy each other,"},"373":{"dur":0,"text":"and then you have nothing."},"374":{"dur":1,"text":"But this nothing\nis sort of a life"},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"and there's something\nhappening with this nothingness"},"378":{"dur":1,"text":"that we like to call vacuum."},"380":{"dur":3,"text":"And what I'm studying\nis a theory which tries"},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"to put a structure\non this vacuum."},"387":{"dur":4,"text":"So let me give you a quick\noverview of sort of a little bit"},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"of astrophysics or astronomy."},"394":{"dur":1,"text":"I think you should\ncall it back that."},"395":{"dur":3,"text":"So Ptolemy, you see when\nhe approximately lived."},"399":{"dur":2,"text":"This most roughly\nthe solar system"},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"that the Ancient\nGreeks had in mind"},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"and that they deducted\nfrom observations."},"408":{"dur":3,"text":"And if you have a careful\nlook here, this is almost like"},"412":{"dur":1,"text":"and what you have\nlearned in school."},"414":{"dur":1,"text":"So obviously, the\nearth isn't there."},"416":{"dur":3,"text":"But if you think about your sort\nof school Astrophysics, Mercury,"},"419":{"dur":5,"text":"Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,\nit's all in the correct order."},"425":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's actually amazing\nthat this structure"},"428":{"dur":1,"text":"of the solar system\nhas actually been known"},"430":{"dur":0,"text":"for thousands of years."},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"So-- and what people\nhave done, they just went"},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"out into the night sky\nand every night very,"},"436":{"dur":1,"text":"very carefully made observations"},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"about individual\nobjects in the night sky."},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think it's amazing\nbecause we always claim"},"443":{"dur":1,"text":"that we have this great\nknowledge, but this people,"},"445":{"dur":3,"text":"due to sort of years of very\nhard and very precise work"},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"of observational skills,\nthey deducted this map"},"453":{"dur":3,"text":"of the solar system which\nI think is actually amazing"},"457":{"dur":1,"text":"because it isn't far off"},"458":{"dur":4,"text":"from how we view the\nsolar system today."},"462":{"dur":1,"text":"So what I'm trying to say"},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"or emphasize is this is\nactually amazingly good."},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"The only difference or the only\nthing that isn't quite right"},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"and so, well, I cheated\nwhen I wrote this out,"},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"so here in the middle is a\nlittle picture of the earth"},"475":{"dur":4,"text":"with the moon around us, and\nyou see in there in this sort"},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"of fourth shell is\nmeant to be the sun."},"483":{"dur":5,"text":"So, if we swap earth and sun in\nthis map around, we are done,"},"489":{"dur":0,"text":"and you would think what?"},"490":{"dur":0,"text":"That's easy."},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"I should have only taken a few\nyears to think of this one out,"},"493":{"dur":3,"text":"and interestingly,\ntook 1,500 years"},"498":{"dur":3,"text":"for us humans to\nswap two objects."},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"And if you think about it, it's\namazing, 1,500 years to do this."},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"And the more I think about it,"},"508":{"dur":1,"text":"the more amazing I\nactually find it."},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"But anyway, let's not get\ntoo sidetracked about this."},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"So, what happened in\nthese 1,500 years?"},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, lots of observations\nof what do I took about them,"},"521":{"dur":1,"text":"there was one problem\nwith this model."},"524":{"dur":3,"text":"There was one problem with\nthis model and this model was,"},"527":{"dur":3,"text":"if you assume that the earth is\nat the center of the universe"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"that we assumed then, and all\nthe planets are sort of flying"},"533":{"dur":1,"text":"around the earth,\nyou would assume"},"535":{"dur":4,"text":"that the individual planets\nover time would sort of fly just"},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"across the sky like\nthis, what happens"},"541":{"dur":3,"text":"when you do very careful\nobservations is they fly forward"},"545":{"dur":3,"text":"a bit and then they move back\nand then they fly forward again."},"549":{"dur":3,"text":"The fancy work for this\nis the retrograde motion"},"552":{"dur":0,"text":"of the planets."},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is really what led\nto the downfall of this model."},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"If you want to do\nthis correctly,"},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"you have to do something\nwhich is somewhat unnatural."},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"You put the planet on a circle\nwith flies around the earth"},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"and then you put the planet then"},"568":{"dur":1,"text":"on this circle you\nput another circle,"},"570":{"dur":1,"text":"and you put the planet\non this circle."},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"That doesn't quite work and then\nyou add more and more circles."},"574":{"dur":3,"text":"These are called epicycles\nyield to wonderful pictures."},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"It looks a bit like\na spiral graph."},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"So if you remember\nfrom your childhood,"},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"if this little plastic ring,\nyou put a starry graph n"},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"and then you do this drawing."},"586":{"dur":4,"text":"But what you see in there, if I\nshow you, so the earth is meant"},"590":{"dur":3,"text":"to be in the middle and if\nyou watch one planet flying"},"593":{"dur":3,"text":"in the night sky, you\nsee if it's a circle"},"596":{"dur":1,"text":"on a circle it can make\nthis little loop here"},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"which is precisely what we\nobserved in the night sky."},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"And there are, of course,\nproblems with this,"},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"with this model, and it\ngets rather complicated"},"609":{"dur":1,"text":"and it gets a bit unnatural"},"610":{"dur":3,"text":"and observations became\nbetter and better."},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"Astronomers make them realize"},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"that probably this\nmodel isn't quite right."},"619":{"dur":3,"text":"And the first person to make\na significant contribution is"},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"Copernicus who did\nlots of observations"},"626":{"dur":3,"text":"and proposed the so-called\nheliocentric model,"},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"so Helios is the\nGreek word for Sun"},"634":{"dur":1,"text":"and he basically\ndid what I said."},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"He just swapped the\nEarth and the Sun around."},"637":{"dur":4,"text":"So, 1,500 years later and this\nmodel work incredibly well."},"642":{"dur":4,"text":"What I find quite interesting,\nand if you think about the role"},"647":{"dur":0,"text":"of the church back then,"},"648":{"dur":1,"text":"obviously the Catholic\nChurch was sort"},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"of the dominant force everywhere\nand they wanted the Earth"},"652":{"dur":1,"text":"to be center of the universe."},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"And along came Copernicus and\nsaid, \"It's not quite right.\""},"657":{"dur":3,"text":"I think he was largely\nleft alone because he lived"},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"in the Northeast of Europe,\nso it wasn't really--"},"664":{"dur":2,"text":"he wasn't sort of\nin the influence"},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"of the Roman Catholic Church\nback then, but interestingly,"},"669":{"dur":4,"text":"I can tell you interesting fact,\nso he left from 1473 to 1543."},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"Martin Luther was also--\nonly born 10 years later"},"677":{"dur":1,"text":"and died three years later."},"678":{"dur":1,"text":"And if you put this\ninto context,"},"680":{"dur":1,"text":"it's actually not\nsurprising that this--"},"681":{"dur":3,"text":"that these two people\nactually influenced, well,"},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"history the way they did."},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"But it took two more people"},"690":{"dur":4,"text":"to actually verify this\nheliocentric model,"},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"and these are two astronomers,\nwell, one is an astronomer,"},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"Kepler, Galileo,\nsort of a scientist"},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"who did almost everything."},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"He invented the telescope\nfor instance"},"705":{"dur":1,"text":"and for very practical purposes."},"707":{"dur":4,"text":"But Kepler was the one who\nobserved the night sky very,"},"712":{"dur":1,"text":"very carefully and managed"},"713":{"dur":3,"text":"to deduct what we now\ncalled Kepler's laws"},"717":{"dur":1,"text":"of the gravitational force."},"719":{"dur":4,"text":"And is it actually,\nthese two that led"},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"to probably the most significant\ncontribution I'm speaking"},"728":{"dur":1,"text":"about now, and this\nis of course, Newton."},"730":{"dur":4,"text":"So Newton in the sort of\n17, 18th century managed"},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"to formulate a theory of gravity"},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"that correctly describes these\nlaws that Kepler derived."},"742":{"dur":1,"text":"What the most amazing things"},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"about Newton is he realized\nwhile working on the problem"},"747":{"dur":3,"text":"of the motion of the planets\nthat the mathematics he needed"},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"to describe the physics\ndid not exist."},"754":{"dur":1,"text":"So he sat down and\ninvented it all."},"757":{"dur":1,"text":"So all of you, do\nyou what calculus is?"},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"He just sat down and it\nwas for him a by-product,"},"761":{"dur":3,"text":"a necessary tool to develop\na gravitational theory."},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"From today's point of\nview, this is impossible"},"768":{"dur":2,"text":"to redo for any scientist."},"770":{"dur":2,"text":"If you now have a problem in\nphysics, you can be pretty sure"},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"that there's a mathematician\nout there that knows many--"},"776":{"dur":1,"text":"much more math than you do"},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"and that can tell you what\nmathematics exist and doesn't."},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"I think it's unheard of any\nmodern scientist just sit down"},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"and say, \"Okay, I'll\ninvent a whole new host"},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"of mathematics then I do\nthe entire physical theory"},"787":{"dur":1,"text":"and then I'll sell it\nto all my colleagues,\""},"789":{"dur":1,"text":"and they say, \"Well done.\""},"791":{"dur":1,"text":"It's absolutely unheard of."},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"So-- which is really--"},"796":{"dur":3,"text":"it's amazing that he\nhas managed to do this."},"801":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is the most-- the sort"},"802":{"dur":1,"text":"of the most complicated\nequation actually"},"804":{"dur":1,"text":"but an interesting thing\nachieved is Newton's"},"806":{"dur":3,"text":"Gravitational Constant,\nso this thing here,"},"810":{"dur":1,"text":"and then you can actually\nmeasure this quite easily"},"811":{"dur":0,"text":"in the lab."},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"It's called with\nthe torsion strings."},"814":{"dur":1,"text":"You put a few balls\non the torsion string"},"816":{"dur":1,"text":"and you can do a\nrelatively simply experiment"},"819":{"dur":1,"text":"and measure this."},"820":{"dur":3,"text":"So, if you again look at the\ntimeline, there was Ptolemy"},"824":{"dur":5,"text":"on the Babylonian sort of up\nto, well, zero or 100 years."},"829":{"dur":3,"text":"But you see, and then\n1,500 years, nothing"},"833":{"dur":2,"text":"and then you have all these\ncontributions from Copernicus,"},"836":{"dur":3,"text":"Kepler, Galileo and Newton all\npretty much clustered together."},"839":{"dur":4,"text":"And of course, once\nyou've reinvent nature in--"},"844":{"dur":1,"text":"or if you manage to\ndescribe nature and mix"},"846":{"dur":2,"text":"up significant changes to\nour views, you don't expect"},"848":{"dur":1,"text":"that this just continues."},"850":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's not surprising that\nthere was an almost sort of 2,"},"852":{"dur":3,"text":"300-year break and this is when\nEinstein came on to the scene."},"858":{"dur":4,"text":"And Einstein changed\nfundamentally the view--"},"862":{"dur":4,"text":"we view the gravitational\nforce or gravitational,"},"867":{"dur":2,"text":"if you wouldn't call it force\nanymore, the gravitational law."},"870":{"dur":7,"text":"And his theory is based on this\nequation that equates a geometry"},"877":{"dur":3,"text":"on the left hand side and a\nmatter on the right hand side,"},"881":{"dur":2,"text":"and again, you have Newton's\ngravitational constant here"},"884":{"dur":1,"text":"featuring very prominently."},"887":{"dur":3,"text":"So let me tell you a little bit\nof what this equation means,"},"891":{"dur":1,"text":"\"geometry equals matter\"."},"893":{"dur":2,"text":"And it is easily-- oh not\neasily, but you can explain it"},"895":{"dur":1,"text":"with a nice little picture."},"897":{"dur":4,"text":"So instead of having a force\nwhich tells these two objects,"},"902":{"dur":1,"text":"so you have two objects and\nNewton would say, \"Well,"},"904":{"dur":1,"text":"there's a force between the two"},"905":{"dur":1,"text":"and so they will move\ntowards each other.\""},"908":{"dur":3,"text":"In Einstein's theory, force is\nnot really a direct concept."},"911":{"dur":3,"text":"It's just a result of something\nthat is happening, so as you see"},"915":{"dur":1,"text":"in this picture, you have\nhere depicted the Earth"},"917":{"dur":1,"text":"on a little grid."},"919":{"dur":3,"text":"So the grid is representing\na four-dimensional space time"},"923":{"dur":0,"text":"which is not flat."},"925":{"dur":0,"text":"So this is bent."},"926":{"dur":2,"text":"And the idea is you have\nthe Earth, say in the middle"},"929":{"dur":3,"text":"of this sheet, and if you\nput a second object near it,"},"933":{"dur":2,"text":"it would just roll down, so\nyou can try this at home."},"935":{"dur":0,"text":"You take a bed sheet."},"936":{"dur":2,"text":"Ask your friend to hold the\ncorners,

a force, but the\nphysical reason for the force is"},"945":{"dur":3,"text":"of course the bending of the\nbed sheet or, in this case,"},"949":{"dur":2,"text":"the bending of the\nfour-dimensional space time."},"952":{"dur":3,"text":"So, this is somehow,\nfor people back then,"},"955":{"dur":1,"text":"this was pretty revolutionary"},"957":{"dur":2,"text":"because forces were the key\nconcepts of physics and all"},"960":{"dur":1,"text":"of a sudden someone comes along"},"961":{"dur":1,"text":"and tells you there are no\nforces, they're just sort"},"963":{"dur":2,"text":"of side-effects of some real\nphysics that is going on."},"968":{"dur":4,"text":"So, the concept of\nforce becomes obsolete."},"972":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is quite crucial."},"975":{"dur":2,"text":"And time and space
