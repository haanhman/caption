Brad: Their bodies, yeah.\nChristina: Tell us a little bit about that."},"775":{"dur":5,"text":"Brad: So it's fascinating.

And you might think, what's\nthe big deal?

And so I think the"},"822":{"dur":6,"text":"story here is that having that experience\nwith your dad basically teaches kids, to some"},"829":{"dur":4,"text":"extent, how to control their emotions and\ntheir bodies and then they take that knowledge"},"833":{"dur":4,"text":"and they bring it with them into the classroom\nor onto the soccer field or the football field"},"838":{"dur":4,"text":"or to the playground.

Brad: So if the kid is biting\nor kicking his father in that, he soon learns"},"849":{"dur":7,"text":"that's not appropriate and that's not acceptable.\nAnd so, they're taking some life lessons from"},"856":{"dur":4,"text":"the family room floor to their classroom,\nand the playground, and the soccer field."},"860":{"dur":7,"text":"Christina: So the girl, she'll have a mother\nwho's...so many single mothers are heroic"},"868":{"dur":5,"text":"and they're working so hard and the kids love\nthem and respect them, but the daughter also"},"873":{"dur":5,"text":"emulates her.

And if the father is not\nthere, it'll be, well, we hope there's a surrogate,"},"884":{"dur":5,"text":"but if not, it would be friends, I guess,\nor peers. Brad: Right, and so one of the things"},"890":{"dur":4,"text":"that David Autor is hypothesizing in his work,\nagain, showing that poor boys are being hit"},"894":{"dur":7,"text":"particularly hard by fatherlessness in their\ncommunities. Autor at MIT, again, is thinking"},"901":{"dur":4,"text":"that what may be happening here is that poor\nboys are often in a situation where they don't"},"906":{"dur":10,"text":"have regular access to in their own home to\na father who is going to work every day and"},"916":{"dur":6,"text":"who is involved as a husband and a father\nin the home.

It was well worth"},"939":{"dur":4,"text":"putting up on the Internet. Christina: Yes,\nI was very impressed by that and did mention"},"943":{"dur":8,"text":"it in some of my research.

How does that"},"968":{"dur":9,"text":"work? Brad: So what you've been finding in\nthe research is that men are transformed by"},"977":{"dur":5,"text":"marriage and by married fatherhood, so men\nwho get married and stay married and have"},"983":{"dur":4,"text":"kids in marriage tend to work longer hours.\nThey tend to work more strategically.

So when men..."},"1003":{"dur":3,"text":"Christina: And more likely to be a little\nnagged, but it's worth the health. Brad: Yes,"},"1006":{"dur":4,"text":"right. It's worth the long-term...yes, there's\na long-term benefit. So yeah, marriage has"},"1011":{"dur":8,"text":"a big impact on men's lives. And work done\nby Harvard sociologists, for instance, suggests"},"1020":{"dur":7,"text":"that this marriage premium is highest among\nmen who are married in intact families with"},"1028":{"dur":4,"text":"their kids in the household. So having that\nmotivation to provide for your kids is a big"},"1033":{"dur":6,"text":"factor for many men. Christina: Yeah, so all\nof these things, we look at the benefits for"},"1039":{"dur":4,"text":"women and, well, did we talk about that? Brad:\nWell, it's an important, I think, point to"},"1044":{"dur":7,"text":"hit on actually because there was a time in\nrecent history when women were getting married"},"1052":{"dur":5,"text":"and they would pay a marriage penalty for\nmarriage. What's fascinating is that today,"},"1057":{"dur":4,"text":"it's a new world. And so, what we're seeing\nfrom a new study at Columbia University, for"},"1062":{"dur":4,"text":"instance, is that we do...women still have\na motherhood penalty. Women are more likely"},"1067":{"dur":3,"text":"to withdraw to some extent from the labor\nforce when they have children. But what's"},"1070":{"dur":6,"text":"fascinating is that today married moms have\na smaller penalty than unmarried moms do."},"1076":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think the story there probably is that\nthe married moms have a partner who's helping"},"1081":{"dur":6,"text":"them navigate the challenges of juggling work\nand family, and maybe spelling them at certain"},"1087":{"dur":4,"text":"times, taking the kids at a certain times.\nAnd having that husband in the picture makes"},"1092":{"dur":7,"text":"it easier for them to remain in the labor\nforce.
