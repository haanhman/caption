what chemistry is and how it has a benefit\ntowards society, and how I feel like when teaching"},"92":{"dur":5,"text":"and mentoring students I want to show them the\nbenefits of communicating science correctly,"},"98":{"dur":5,"text":"and make sure we explain why research\nis so important in this world today."},"103":{"dur":6,"text":"So it's really the study of how the state of matter\nand how it combines, reacts, interacts, and changes."},"109":{"dur":4,"text":"And those just a few descriptors, but really\nwhen you define, when you're taking gen chem,"},"114":{"dur":5,"text":"it's something about looking at what happens\nbetween reactants and how they become products."},"119":{"dur":3,"text":"And so in that same parallel way I\nwant to tell you a little bit about me."},"124":{"dur":5,"text":"So the little Joy becoming the big Joy, and it's really\nthis arrow right here that makes a huge difference."},"130":{"dur":4,"text":"So if you're a chemist, you know that\nthere are atoms, molecules, elements,"},"134":{"dur":2,"text":"things that change and go from one thing to another."},"137":{"dur":4,"text":"So in that exact same parallel way, right,\nthere are things that have been catalysts,"},"142":{"dur":5,"text":"people that have changed me, things that\nhave influenced me, and yet because we know"},"147":{"dur":2,"text":"with this arrow that you form these products."},"150":{"dur":4,"text":"In real life, right, we know that those\nthings don't always go to the final product."},"155":{"dur":1,"text":"There might be variations of that."},"157":{"dur":4,"text":"And so I'm here to talk to you about\nthose variations and what influenced me."},"162":{"dur":6,"text":"So I grew up in a household youngest of\nthree kids, two older brothers, in the 70s."},"168":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is sort of my first introduction to chemistry."},"171":{"dur":5,"text":"And you'll see, some of you will recognize,\nthis is the Gilbert Fun with Chemistry Kit."},"176":{"dur":6,"text":"And so I was early influenced by chemistry\nby looking at these chemistry kits"},"183":{"dur":1,"text":"that had all these chemicals in there."},"185":{"dur":3,"text":"And you'll see that this is the image that\nI first saw of what a chemist should do."},"189":{"dur":4,"text":"Right, that there's this spark of electricity\nhere, that you observe things in a test tube,"},"194":{"dur":3,"text":"that there's this wonderful, colorful\nreaction that takes place, there's submarines,"},"198":{"dur":5,"text":"and it's just this wonderful picture from the\n70s of what this Gilbert chemistry kit embodied."},"205":{"dur":5,"text":"This is also my first view of what a chemistry\nlab looked like, and who was in a chemistry lab."},"210":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's just kind of fun to see that, you know,\nthat despite the fact that when I looked at picture"},"215":{"dur":3,"text":"of what chemists looked like and chemistry\nlabs look like now it's quite different."},"219":{"dur":4,"text":"Lab coats are still around, lab benches are\nstill around, but the group of diverse people"},"223":{"dur":2,"text":"in that laboratory has now changed quite a bit."},"226":{"dur":6,"text":"It's very international, it's very stratified\nby various female and male scientists."},"233":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's nice to see that there has been\nsome change in this picture of chemistry."},"238":{"dur":1,"text":"But what really influenced me?"},"239":{"dur":1,"text":"What got me interested in chemistry the most?"},"241":{"dur":6,"text":"It was really this idea of looking at what\nhappens when you think about color and chemistry."},"248":{"dur":5,"text":"And so this is a picture here, same thing in that\nGilbert handbook manual, where you have these two kids"},"253":{"dur":5,"text":"that are looking at this rainbow, and then\nthere's this chemical world that's out there."},"258":{"dur":5,"text":"And so the thing that really influenced me when\nI was child was the idea of looking at fireworks,"},"264":{"dur":5,"text":"and these beautiful reactions that happening\nwhen you saw the 4th of July fireworks"},"269":{"dur":2,"text":"or any celebratory event where you had fireworks."},"272":{"dur":5,"text":"And that really just enthralled me, enthralled\nmy imagination, and made me very curious"},"278":{"dur":5,"text":"in discovering how these reactions occurred,\nwhy they occurred, how they could be influenced."},"284":{"dur":2,"text":"So that was my early introduction into chemistry."},"290":{"dur":8,"text":"Fourth grade comes along, and I'm in my public school,\ndaily elementary, and our first project was to bring"},"298":{"dur":4,"text":"in a piece of food and to put it into a\nbaby food jar and observe the changes."},"304":{"dur":5,"text":"So I knowing that I had ham and cheese sandwiches\nevery day, brought in a piece of cheese,"},"309":{"dur":4,"text":"and I brought in this Kraft piece of\ncheese, put it into my baby food jar,"},"314":{"dur":3,"text":"and just like all my other classmates\nevery day observed it for three weeks,"},"317":{"dur":1,"text":"writing down observations of what happened."},"319":{"dur":4,"text":"So I was just ready and prepared to write\nthese copious notes of what I was seeing."},"325":{"dur":4,"text":"To my surprise, but maybe not to\nothers, this piece of cheese sat"},"329":{"dur":3,"text":"in that baby food jar for weeks and nothing changed."},"333":{"dur":5,"text":"And I got very creative in my description of\nhow that cheese melted, oozed, changed form,"},"339":{"dur":4,"text":"but really never saw any biological\nchange as far as mold growth,"},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"which is what the whole entire experiment was about."},"346":{"dur":4,"text":"But it really perked my interest, right, because I was\nbeing a scientist at that point, observing changing,"},"351":{"dur":4,"text":"and trying to figure out what was going on,\nwhy did this piece of cheese not change."},"356":{"dur":7,"text":"So, you know, go a few more years ahead, go to junior\nhigh and I started learning from a wonderful group"},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"of scientists and teachers at Edison Computech."},"367":{"dur":3,"text":"And I learned all about the periodic table of elements."},"370":{"dur":4,"text":"So anybody who's a chemist knows this\nperiodic table of elements very well."},"374":{"dur":5,"text":"It's sort of our handbook of all the various different\nchemicals that are out there, and I'll note to chemists"},"380":{"dur":4,"text":"that are here, I've included the newest\nelements that have been found in the last year,"},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"and their names and their representations."},"387":{"dur":5,"text":"But it's really this as sort of the roadmap that\nhelped me discover what chemistry was all about."},"393":{"dur":5,"text":"And it was very serendipitous in trying to figure\nout, okay, so, now that I know all these elements,"},"398":{"dur":6,"text":"and I can look at these symbols and understand\nwhat they mean, what does this truly mean in terms"},"404":{"dur":2,"text":"of what I can do to expand my knowledge."},"407":{"dur":6,"text":"Okay. So this is where when I think about when I'm\nteaching biochemistry to students in my course,"},"414":{"dur":3,"text":"I think about how can I relate this to everyday life."},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"How can I relate it to things\nthat they'd be able to enjoy?"},"421":{"dur":4,"text":"That they may see later on in life, where they\nmay find some discoveries that would help them."},"425":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is where I begin my story about biochemistry."},"430":{"dur":5,"text":"Right. So we've gone from looking at elements, atoms,\nand now we're going to start expanding that view"},"435":{"dur":3,"text":"by thinking of things in a macromolecular\nstructural view."},"439":{"dur":4,"text":"So proteins, DNA, all the things\nthat I've taught Paneet"},"443":{"dur":3,"text":"and the other classmates she\nhas in chem 1 55A and beyond."},"447":{"dur":5,"text":"So here's our translation of\nwhat goes on in biochemistry."},"452":{"dur":6,"text":"And the metaphor that I draw is that\nwe think about DNA, RNA, and proteins."},"459":{"dur":7,"text":"So the central dogma is biochemistry is going DNA,\ntranscription, translation, RNA, to protein or enzyme."},"466":{"dur":6,"text":"And so when we think about the different words\nand things that make up the bits and parts,"},"473":{"dur":5,"text":"I think about them as nucleic acids or\nthe DNA\/RNA representing the alphabet."},"479":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay. And then you look at proteins, you\nalso have things that represent the alphabet."},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"So these are looking at the\nfundamental bits and pieces."},"486":{"dur":4,"text":"So the nucleotides and the amino\nacids that make up the alphabet"},"491":{"dur":4,"text":"for the nucleic acids of DNA\/RNA\nand proteins and enzymes."},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay. So this is the fundamental basis"},"497":{"dur":4,"text":"by which we explain things related\nto biochemistry and macromolecules."},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"The words that you form are these codons."},"505":{"dur":5,"text":"So these bits of nucleotides or these amino\nacids form these words when they come together."},"511":{"dur":4,"text":"And so you can see this codon here for nucleic acids."},"516":{"dur":3,"text":"Likewise for amino acids when they\ncome together to form these words,"},"520":{"dur":3,"text":"they form these different words\nthat have different structures."},"523":{"dur":1,"text":"And then finally sentences."},"525":{"dur":3,"text":"So when you take the alphabet, the\nwords, and these sentences it translates"},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"to the nucleotides, the codons, and the genes."},"532":{"dur":5,"text":"Likewise for proteins you get your amino acids,\nyour alpha helices, beta strands, and your proteins."},"538":{"dur":5,"text":"Okay, so this is the fundamental part of\nwhat I teach in biochemistry structure."},"544":{"dur":6,"text":"And one of things I often do with my students is I like\nto bring in demos and models, Paneet mentioned this."},"551":{"dur":5,"text":"So these should look familiar to\nanybody who's had my biochemistry class."},"556":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is what we call a tuber."},"558":{"dur":4,"text":"This represents the string of amino\nacids and the polypeptide structure"},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"of what you can form from a protein or an enzyme."},"566":{"dur":5,"text":"And so we play around with looking at these\nstructures, of how you get all these twists and turns"},"572":{"dur":4,"text":"that form a macromolecule such\nas a protein or an enzyme."},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"Likewise I like to bring in structures."},"581":{"dur":4,"text":"Students often will build a paper molecule of\nthis, but this is green fluorescent protein,"},"586":{"dur":4,"text":"which amazingly has won the Nobel\nPrize, because it's a wonderful tool"},"591":{"dur":4,"text":"for visualizing things that you normally cannot see."},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"So this comes and was isolated\noriginally from jellyfish."},"599":{"dur":4,"text":"But it's a protein that fluoresces green\nthat you can put in to other things,"},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'll talk about those other\nthings near the end as we go along."},"611":{"dur":4,"text":"So this story leads us, after this description\nof the alphabet, the words, and sentences,"},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"to talking about macromolecular structures."},"618":{"dur":7,"text":"So my scientific life, so to speak, has been really\ndictated by three of these major proteins or enzymes."},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm going to talk about each one of these."},"634":{"dur":3,"text":"So the first is copper zinc superoxide dismutase."},"637":{"dur":4,"text":"It is an enzyme that's related to Lou Gehrig's\ndisease, and I'm going to talk about how"},"642":{"dur":7,"text":"that was my first protein love when I started graduate\nschool, and I characterized it to find out how it bound"},"649":{"dur":4,"text":"up to metal ions and how it reacted\nin vivo, in a biological system."},"654":{"dur":5,"text":"Second protein is called amyloid precursor\nprotein, and it's related to Alzheimer's disease."},"659":{"dur":3,"text":"I really studied this protein during\nmy post-doctoral work in research."},"664":{"dur":4,"text":"And finally what I brought to Fresno\nState most recently is this desiccation"},"668":{"dur":5,"text":"of an environmental putative toxin called BMAA\nthat's related to the disease called ALS-PDC."},"674":{"dur":6,"text":"So I'm going to walk you through these three different\nenzymes, tell you a little bit more about them,"},"680":{"dur":4,"text":"and why I got so interested in studying them,\nand the discovery process that occurred."},"684":{"dur":6,"text":"So much of what got me into science was\nthinking about the unknown, discovering things,"},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"and really being focused on what is research."},"695":{"dur":5,"text":"This is an experience that I like to tell\nstudents about the most, because this is something"},"700":{"dur":6,"text":"that you don't necessarily see in textbooks\nor read about, per say, but it's an experience"},"706":{"dur":4,"text":"that I think every undergraduate and graduate\nstudent should experience here at Fresno State."},"711":{"dur":4,"text":"As an undergraduate STEM major, it's really\nimportant to be able to go beyond what you're learning"},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"in the lecture and expand that into something"},"718":{"dur":4,"text":"where you're really truly are discovering\nsomething novel that has an impact."},"722":{"dur":5,"text":"And so research to me has been a way in which\nI can work with students, mentor students,"},"727":{"dur":5,"text":"but also translate what they see in the textbook\ninto something that's more viable and more relatable."},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"So what is research?"},"736":{"dur":3,"text":"You can think of it as a cared for or diligent search."},"740":{"dur":3,"text":"Something that's a studious inquiry or examination,"},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"but it's really collecting information\nabout a particular subject."},"748":{"dur":4,"text":"And I know that sounds very generic,\nbut once you decide and you figure"},"752":{"dur":4,"text":"out that there's a particular area that you're\ninterested in, delving into that subject,"},"756":{"dur":5,"text":"and we're gathering all that information is\nreally what drove me to want to pursue research"},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"and pursue an advanced degree in chemistry."},"765":{"dur":8,"text":"So I'm going to tell you a little bit about what we've\nbeen doing in our research lab, which is the problem,"},"774":{"dur":3,"text":"why we're trying to solve it,\nand the what, why, and how of it."},"777":{"dur":3,"text":"So I often frame this same type\nof question to my students"},"781":{"dur":1,"text":"when I'm talking about things in the classroom."},"783":{"dur":4,"text":"So that they start to think about it in terms of\nthe way in which a scientist thinks about things."},"788":{"dur":3,"text":"So then what is neurodegenerative diseases?"},"792":{"dur":4,"text":"So we know that there's Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS."},"796":{"dur":3,"text":"Those are all three different types\nof neurodegenerative diseases."},"800":{"dur":3,"text":"The why is why is it so prevalent\nin our society and world."},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay.
