the things that's really important"},"201":{"dur":1,"text":"when we're thinking about stem cells"},"203":{"dur":2,"text":"is that obviously stem cells \ncan be many different

much every tissue you can think of."},"227":{"dur":1,"text":"And actually, the structure of those tissues"},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"is quite different, and it's going to really depend"},"231":{"dur":2,"text":"on whether your patient has any underlying disease,"},"233":{"dur":3,"text":"other conditions, in terms of how"},"236":{"dur":1,"text":"you're going to regenerate your tissue,"},"238":{"dur":1,"text":"and you're going to need to think about the materials"},"240":{"dur":2,"text":"you're going to use really carefully,"},"242":{"dur":1,"text":"their biochemistry, their mechanics,"},"244":{"dur":3,"text":"and many other properties as well."},"248":{"dur":3,"text":"Our tissues all have very \ndifferent abilities to regenerate,"},"251":{"dur":1,"text":"and here we see poor Prometheus,"},"253":{"dur":3,"text":"who made a rather tricky career choice"},"256":{"dur":2,"text":"and was punished by the Greek gods."},"259":{"dur":2,"text":"He was tied to a rock, and an eagle would come"},"261":{"dur":1,"text":"every day to eat his liver."},"263":{"dur":2,"text":"But of course his liver would regenerate every day,"},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"and so day after day he was punished"},"267":{"dur":5,"text":"for eternity by the gods."},"273":{"dur":3,"text":"And liver will regenerate in this very nice way,"},"277":{"dur":1,"text":"but actually if we think of other tissues,"},"279":{"dur":1,"text":"like cartilage, for example,"},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"even the simplest nick and you're going to find it"},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"really difficult to regenerate your cartilage."},"285":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's going to be very different from tissue to tissue."},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, bone is somewhere in between,"},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"and this is one of the tissues \nthat we work on a lot in our lab."},"294":{"dur":1,"text":"And bone is actually quite good at repairing."},"296":{"dur":2,"text":"It has to be. We've probably all had fractures"},"298":{"dur":1,"text":"at some point or other."},"299":{"dur":2,"text":"And one of the ways that you can think"},"302":{"dur":1,"text":"about repairing your fracture"},"303":{"dur":2,"text":"is this procedure here, called \nan iliac crest harvest."},"306":{"dur":1,"text":"And what the surgeon might do"},"308":{"dur":3,"text":"is take some bone from your iliac crest,"},"311":{"dur":1,"text":"which is just here,"},"312":{"dur":2,"text":"and then transplant that \nsomewhere else in the body."},"315":{"dur":1,"text":"And it actually works really well,"},"316":{"dur":1,"text":"because it's your own bone,"},"318":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's well vascularized,"},"319":{"dur":2,"text":"which means it's got a really good blood supply."},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"But the problem is, there's\nonly so much you can take,"},"324":{"dur":2,"text":"and also when you do that operation,"},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"your patients might actually have significant pain"},"330":{"dur":3,"text":"in that defect site even two \nyears after the operation."},"333":{"dur":1,"text":"So what we were thinking is,"},"335":{"dur":3,"text":"there's a tremendous need \nfor bone repair, of course,"},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"but this iliac crest-type approach"},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"really has a lot of limitations to it,"},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"and could we perhaps recreate"},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"the generation of bone within the body"},"347":{"dur":3,"text":"on demand and then be able to transplant it"},"351":{"dur":4,"text":"without these very, very painful aftereffects"},"356":{"dur":3,"text":"that you would have with the iliac crest harvest?"},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"And so this is what we did, and the way we did it"},"362":{"dur":3,"text":"was by coming back to this typical tissue-engineering approach"},"365":{"dur":2,"text":"but actually thinking about it rather differently."},"368":{"dur":1,"text":"And we simplified it a lot,"},"370":{"dur":2,"text":"so we got rid of a lot of these steps."},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"We got rid of the need to \nharvest cells from the patient,"},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"we got rid of the need to put \nin really fancy chemistries,"},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"and we got rid of the need"},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"to culture these scaffolds in the lab."},"381":{"dur":2,"text":"And what we really focused on"},"384":{"dur":3,"text":"was our material system and making it quite simple,"},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"but because we used it in a really clever way,"},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"we were able to generate enormous amounts of bone"},"392":{"dur":1,"text":"using this approach."},"394":{"dur":1,"text":"So we were using the body"},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"as really the catalyst to help us"},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"to make lots of new bone."},"400":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's an approach that we call"},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"the in vivo bioreactor, and we were able to make"},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"enormous amounts of bone using this approach."},"407":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'll talk you through this."},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"So what we do is,"},"411":{"dur":2,"text":"in humans, we all have a layer of stem cells"},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"on the outside of our long bones."},"415":{"dur":1,"text":"That layer is called the periosteum."},"417":{"dur":2,"text":"And that layer is actually normally"},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"very, very tightly bound to the underlying bone,"},"422":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's got stem cells in it."},"423":{"dur":1,"text":"Those stem cells are really important"},"425":{"dur":1,"text":"in the embryo when it develops,"},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"and they also sort of wake up if you have a fracture"},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"to help you with repairing the bone."},"432":{"dur":2,"text":"So we take that periosteum layer"},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"and we developed a way to inject underneath it"},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"a liquid that then, within 30 seconds,"},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"would turn into quite a rigid gel"},"441":{"dur":3,"text":"and can actually lift the\nperiosteum away from the bone."},"445":{"dur":3,"text":"So it creates, in essence, an artificial cavity"},"448":{"dur":3,"text":"that is right next to both the bone"},"452":{"dur":3,"text":"but also this really rich layer of stem cells."},"456":{"dur":1,"text":"And we go in through a pinhole incision"},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"so that no other cells from the body can get in,"},"460":{"dur":4,"text":"and what happens is that that\nartificial in vivo bioreactor cavity"},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"can then lead to the proliferation of these stem cells,"},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"and they can form lots of new tissue,"},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"and then over time, you can harvest that tissue"},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"and use it elsewhere in the body."},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"This is a histology slide"},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"of what we see when we do that,"},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"and essentially what we see"},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"is very large amounts of bone."},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"So in this picture, you can see the middle of the leg,"},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"so the bone marrow,"},"487":{"dur":1,"text":"then you can see the original bone,"},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"and you can see where that original bone finishes,"},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"and just to the left of that is the new bone"},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"that's grown within that bioreactor cavity,"},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"and you can actually make it even larger."},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"And that demarcation that you can see"},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"between the original bone and the new bone"},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"acts as a very slight point of weakness,"},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"so actually now the surgeon can come along,"},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"can harvest away that new bone,"},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"and the periosteum can grow back,"},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"so you're left with the leg"},"514":{"dur":1,"text":"in the same sort of state"},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"as if you hadn't operated on it in the first place."},"518":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's very, very low in terms of after-pain"},"522":{"dur":3,"text":"compared to an iliac crest harvest."},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can grow different amounts of bone"},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"depending on how much gel you put in there,"},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"so it really is an on demand sort of procedure."},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, at the time that we did this,"},"535":{"dur":3,"text":"this received a lot of attention in the press,"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"because it was a really nice way"},"541":{"dur":1,"text":"of generating new bone,"},"542":{"dur":1,"text":"and we got many, many contacts"},"544":{"dur":2,"text":"from different people that \nwere interested in using this."},"547":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'm just going to tell you,"},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"sometimes those contacts are very strange,"},"552":{"dur":1,"text":"slightly unexpected,"},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"and the very most interesting,"},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"let me put it that way, contact that I had,"},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"was actually from a team of American footballers"},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"that all wanted to have double-thickness skulls"},"565":{"dur":4,"text":"made on their head."},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"And so you do get these kinds of contacts,"},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"and of course, being British"},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"and also growing up in France,"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"I tend to be very blunt,"},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"and so I had to explain to them very nicely"},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"that in their particular case,"},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"there probably wasn't that much in there"},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"to protect in the first place."},"587":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"(Applause)"},"590":{"dur":1,"text":"So this was our approach,"},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"and it was simple materials,"},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"but we thought about it carefully."},"596":{"dur":1,"text":"And actually we know that those cells"},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"in the body, in the embryo, as they develop"},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"can form a different kind of tissue, cartilage,"},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"and so we developed a gel that was slightly different"},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"in nature and slightly different chemistry,"},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"put it in there, and we were able to get"},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"100 percent cartilage instead."},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"And this approach works really well, I think,"},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"for pre-planned procedures,"},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"but it's something you do have to pre-plan."},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"So for other kinds of operations,"},"622":{"dur":1,"text":"there's definitely a need for other"},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"scaffold-based approaches."},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"And when you think about designing"},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"those other scaffolds, actually,"},"630":{"dur":1,"text":"you need a really multi-disciplinary team."},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"And so our team has chemists,"},"634":{"dur":3,"text":"it has cell biologists, surgeons, physicists even,"},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"and those people all come together"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"and we think really hard about \ndesigning the materials."},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"But we want to make them have enough information"},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"that we can get the cells to do what we want,"},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"but not be so complex as to make it difficult"},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"to get to clinic."},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"And so one of the things we think about a lot"},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"is really trying to understand"},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"the structure of the tissues in the body."},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"And so if we think of bone,"},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"obviously my own favorite tissue,"},"662":{"dur":1,"text":"we zoom in, we can see,"},"664":{"dur":1,"text":"even if you don't know anything \nabout bone structure,"},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"it's beautifully organized, \nreally beautifully organized."},"668":{"dur":1,"text":"We've lots of blood vessels in there."},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"And if we zoom in again, we see that the cells"},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"are actually surrounded by a 3D matrix"},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"of nano-scale fibers, and they give a lot"},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"of information to the cells."},"680":{"dur":1,"text":"And if we zoom in again,"},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"actually in the case of bone, the matrix"},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"around the cells is beautifully organized"},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"at the nano scale, and it's a hybrid material"},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"that's part organic, part inorganic."},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's led to a whole field, really,"},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"that has looked at developing materials"},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"that have this hybrid kind of structure."},"698":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I'm showing here just two examples"},"701":{"dur":3,"text":"where we've made some materials\nthat have that sort of structure,"},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"and you can really tailor it."},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"You can see here a very squishy one"},"708":{"dur":4,"text":"and now a material that's also \nthis hybrid sort of material"},"712":{"dur":1,"text":"but actually has remarkable toughness,"},"714":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's no longer brittle."},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"And an inorganic material \nwould normally be really brittle,"},"718":{"dur":1,"text":"and you wouldn't be able to have"},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"that sort of strength and toughness in it."},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"One other thing I want to quickly mention is that"},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"many of the scaffolds we make \nare porous, and they have to be,"},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"because you want blood vessels to grow in there."},"729":{"dur":1,"text":"But the pores are actually oftentimes"},"731":{"dur":1,"text":"much bigger than the cells,"},"732":{"dur":1,"text":"and so even though it's 3D,"},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"the cell might see it more \nas a slightly curved surface,"},"737":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's a little bit unnatural."},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"And so one of the things you can think about doing"},"741":{"dur":3,"text":"is actually making scaffolds \nwith slightly different dimensions"},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"that might be able to surround your cells in 3D"},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"and give them a little bit more information."},"749":{"dur":3,"text":"And there's a lot of work going \non in both of these areas."},"753":{"dur":3,"text":"Now finally, I just want to talk a little bit about"},"757":{"dur":2,"text":"applying this sort of thing to cardiovascular disease,"},"760":{"dur":3,"text":"because this is a really big clinical problem."},"763":{"dur":3,"text":"And one of the things that we know is that,"},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"unfortunately, if you have a heart attack,"},"769":{"dur":2,"text":"then that tissue can start to die,"},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"and your outcome may not be very good over time."},"775":{"dur":1,"text":"And it would be really great, actually,"},"777":{"dur":1,"text":"if we could stop that dead tissue"},"779":{"dur":3,"text":"either from dying or help it to regenerate."},"783":{"dur":3,"text":"And there's lots and lots of stem \ncell trials going on worldwide,"},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"and they use many different types of cells,"},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"but one common theme that seems to be coming out"},"791":{"dur":2,"text":"is that actually, very often, those cells will die"},"794":{"dur":1,"text":"once you've implanted them."},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"And you can either put them into the heart"},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"or into the blood system,"},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"but either way, we don't seem to be able"},"802":{"dur":1,"text":"to get quite the right number of cells"},"804":{"dur":2,"text":"getting to the location we want them to"},"806":{"dur":4,"text":"and being able to deliver the sort of beautiful"},"810":{"dur":2,"text":"cell regeneration that we would like to have"},"813":{"dur":3,"text":"to get good clinical outcomes."},"816":{"dur":1,"text":"And so some of the things that we're thinking of,"},"818":{"dur":3,"text":"and many other people in the field are thinking of,"},"822":{"dur":3,"text":"are actually developing materials for that."},"825":{"dur":1,"text":"But there's a difference here."},"826":{"dur":2,"text":"We still need chemistry, we still need mechanics,"},"828":{"dur":2,"text":"we still need really interesting topography,"},"831":{"dur":2,"text":"and we still need really interesting \nways to surround the cells."},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"But now, the cells also"},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"would probably quite like a material"},"838":{"dur":2,"text":"that's going to be able to be conductive,"},"840":{"dur":4,"text":"because the cells themselves will respond very well"},"845":{"dur":3,"text":"and will actually conduct signals \nbetween themselves."},"848":{"dur":1,"text":"You can see them now"},"850":{"dur":2,"text":"beating synchronously on these materials,"},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's a very, very exciting development"},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"that's going on."},"857":{"dur":4,"text":"So just to wrap up, I'd like to actually say that"},"862":{"dur":2,"text":"being able to work in this sort of field,"},"864":{"dur":1,"text":"all of us that work in this field"},"866":{"dur":2,"text":"that's not only super-exciting science,"},"868":{"dur":2,"text":"but also has the potential"},"870":{"dur":1,"text":"to impact on patients,"},"872":{"dur":2,"text":"however big or small they are,"},"875":{"dur":1,"text":"is really a great privilege."},"876":{"dur":3,"text":"And so for that, I'd like to thank all of you as well."},"879":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you."},"881":{"dur":4,"text":"(Applause)"}}
