Mississippi."},"155":{"dur":4,"text":"My dad had come over to help,\nand as ever with dad,"},"159":{"dur":2,"text":"he decided I was total rubbish,"},"162":{"dur":3,"text":"and so he managed to hitchhike his way\nup to Jackson, Mississippi,"},"165":{"dur":2,"text":"he managed to get in\nto the Governor's mansion,"},"168":{"dur":1,"text":"where he told the Governor that he felt"},"169":{"dur":2,"text":"that not only should\nmy client be executed"},"171":{"dur":3,"text":"but they'd be doing the world a favor\nif they'd execute me at the same time."},"175":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"177":{"dur":2,"text":"There were many people\nin the authorities of Mississippi"},"180":{"dur":2,"text":"who agreed with him on that,"},"182":{"dur":3,"text":"but it was slightly confusing\nfor me at the time."},"185":{"dur":2,"text":"What really helped me, ultimately,"},"187":{"dur":2,"text":"actually it ended up\ndoing death penalty work"},"190":{"dur":4,"text":"was a comprehension of my dad,\nand that some of these things he would do,"},"194":{"dur":3,"text":"were not necessarily\nthe product of a rational

worse."},"206":{"dur":3,"text":"Indeed, he did do some extraordinarily\nbizarre things over the years."},"211":{"dur":1,"text":"One of those actually was my aunt."},"213":{"dur":2,"text":"My aunt Jean was an immensely\ncompassionate woman,"},"215":{"dur":4,"text":"but she simply couldn't understand,\nor accept, perhaps, is a better word,"},"220":{"dur":4,"text":"that her blue-eyed younger brother\nwas mentally ill."},"225":{"dur":3,"text":"So she would always feel\nthat what he was doing was bad,"},"228":{"dur":3,"text":"rather than the product\nof his mental illness."},"231":{"dur":3,"text":"Which is very sad, because I feel\nthat perhaps if my dad"},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"had been recognised earlier,\nhe would have got help."},"237":{"dur":3,"text":"He was only ever sectioned once,\nand he only ever got treatment once."},"240":{"dur":1,"text":"That sort of ruined his life."},"242":{"dur":3,"text":"Which brings me,\nnaturally, to Ricky Langley."},"246":{"dur":5,"text":"Ricky Langley is a guy\nI represented in Louisiana."},"251":{"dur":4,"text":"And Ricky Langley is a pedophile,\nwho's molested a lot of children,"},"255":{"dur":5,"text":"and who ended up killing a six year old\nchild called Jeremy Guillory."},"261":{"dur":5,"text":"I ended up taking on his case\nway back in 1993, for the first time."},"266":{"dur":5,"text":"His story goes back, far back,\nto before he was born even."},"271":{"dur":1,"text":"I want to tell you about his story"},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"because it leads to a woman\ncalled Lorelei Guillory,"},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"who was the mother\nof the child who got killed,"},"279":{"dur":2,"text":"who is one of my great heroes in life."},"281":{"dur":5,"text":"Before Ricky was born, his mum and dad\nwere driving along on this road,"},"287":{"dur":1,"text":"with their two kids in the back."},"288":{"dur":1,"text":"Alcide was driving, and he was drunk"},"290":{"dur":2,"text":"and he drove off the road,\nand hit a telegraph pole."},"293":{"dur":1,"text":"One of the kids in the back"},"294":{"dur":5,"text":"was this tousle-haired little child called\nOscar-Lee; blonde hair, six years old."},"299":{"dur":3,"text":"Lovely little kid, who was the apple\nof his parent's eyes."},"302":{"dur":1,"text":"He was killed instantly,"},"304":{"dur":3,"text":"and his sister, a little younger than him\nwas decapitated and killed."},"308":{"dur":2,"text":"Dreadful, dreadful stuff."},"310":{"dur":1,"text":"And Betsy, the mother,"},"311":{"dur":3,"text":"was thrown through the front windscreen,\nand very badly injured herself."},"315":{"dur":3,"text":"She ended up in Charity Hospital\nfor most of the next two years."},"318":{"dur":4,"text":"She was in a body cast\nfrom her neck to her ankles."},"323":{"dur":3,"text":"At the trial, I had an Australian\nvolunteer of ours model this,"},"326":{"dur":2,"text":"which should warn you never\nto come and work as a volunteer"},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"for a reprieve, I dare say."},"331":{"dur":4,"text":"But when she was in this body cast,\nshe became pregnant."},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"This, of course, had something\nto do with Alcide,"},"338":{"dur":5,"text":"her husband's rather regressive views\nabout the roles of husbands and wives."},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"No one believed she was pregnant,\nbecause how could she be?"},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"Although that was another thing\nwe demonstrated at the trial,"},"350":{"dur":3,"text":"to the amusement of the judge at least,\nwho was a bit of a pervert."},"353":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"355":{"dur":1,"text":"Lovely guy, actually."},"357":{"dur":4,"text":"So she was pregnant,\nbut for five months, no one believed her."},"361":{"dur":4,"text":"And during those five months,\nRicky who was that fetus,"},"365":{"dur":3,"text":"was subjected to his own private\nHiroshima of x-rays"},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"and all of these drugs that she was taking"},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"that should never be given\nto a pregnant woman,"},"373":{"dur":3,"text":"and one of the drugs, bizarrely,\nhas been linked with pedophilia."},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"If you expose a fetus to that drug,"},"380":{"dur":4,"text":"then that individual is much more likely\nto become a pedophile later,"},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's so bizarre,\nwe didn't present that to the jury"},"387":{"dur":3,"text":"because I think they would have thought\nwe made it up, but it's true."},"390":{"dur":5,"text":"Anyway, five months in, the doctors\nfinally accepted she was pregnant,"},"395":{"dur":3,"text":"they cut her body cast off,\nthere was a big old whoosh."},"399":{"dur":2,"text":"They said to her,\n\"You've got to have an abortion."},"401":{"dur":1,"text":"There's no two ways about it,"},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"after all we've done\nto you and that fetus.\""},"405":{"dur":3,"text":"But Alcide, the husband, said,\n\"No, , that's not going to happen."},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm Catholic, we don't do abortions.\""},"410":{"dur":3,"text":"So Betsy carried Ricky to term."},"414":{"dur":4,"text":"When he was born, it was obvious\nhe wasn't the blonde, blue-eyed,"},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"little Oscar-Lee, the apple of their eye."},"420":{"dur":3,"text":"He was strange looking, that's I suppose,\nthe best one can say about it."},"424":{"dur":3,"text":"I am sure they said that\nabout me as a child and still do."},"427":{"dur":4,"text":"But Ricky had obviously\nsuffered immensely in there,"},"432":{"dur":4,"text":"and it was pretty obvious fairly soon\nthat there was something going on."},"436":{"dur":1,"text":"He wasn't Oscar-Lee,"},"438":{"dur":4,"text":"his dad would tease him horribly\nabout him not being Oscar-Lee."},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"He was molested himself."},"444":{"dur":4,"text":"He then, at age eight, starts sleeping\non gravestones in the local cemetery."},"449":{"dur":4,"text":"At ten, he puts a notice\non his school notice-board saying,"},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"\"I am not Ricky Langley, I am Oscar-Lee,\""},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"who you will recall, was the dead brother."},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"Ricky was already\ndeveloping this psychosis"},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"that he was his dead brother, Oscar-Lee,"},"464":{"dur":3,"text":"or Oscar-Lee was his alter-ego,\nwho was his tormentor,"},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"who made him do things\nthat he didn't want to do."},"471":{"dur":3,"text":"Ricky started molesting other children,\nno question about it."},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"He had no understanding\nat that time what was going on."},"479":{"dur":3,"text":"He ultimately was banged up\nin the prison system of Georgia"},"482":{"dur":4,"text":"for molesting a child,\nactually the child of his cousin."},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"This was the first time\nhe ever got counseling,"},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"and the counselors told him,"},"491":{"dur":4,"text":"\"You're a pedophile, you're mentally ill,\nwe can't treat it, it's untreatable."},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"You are going to carry on offending.\""},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"And indeed, under that theory,\nwhich is a slightly bizarre one,"},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"about a year after\nwe set you free from prison,"},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"you will inevitably molest another child.\""},"507":{"dur":3,"text":"Now Ricky, like my father,\nRicky was a very intelligent guy."},"510":{"dur":3,"text":"There is often this stereotype\nthat if you're really bright,"},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"you can't suffer from mental disorders,\nwhich are obviously silly."},"517":{"dur":3,"text":"And Ricky, when he was told this, said,\n\"Look, you've convinced me.\""},"520":{"dur":3,"text":"And he wrote a letter to\nthe Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles"},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"saying, \"Look, don't let me go then,\nfor goodness sake."},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"Put me in a mental hospital\nwhere I belong.\""},"529":{"dur":3,"text":"But bureaucracy being\nwhat bureaucracy often is,"},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"they ignored him, they let him go."},"535":{"dur":4,"text":"Sure enough, about a year later,\nhe ends up killing a small child,"},"539":{"dur":3,"text":"Jeremy Guillory, six years old,\nwho was the child of Lorelei Guillory,"},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"the woman I mentioned before."},"545":{"dur":5,"text":"You know, when I first talked to him,\nand he told me about it, he said,"},"551":{"dur":4,"text":"\"I thought it was Oscar-Lee, my tormentor,\nI was trying to get rid of him!\""},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"Obviously, one of the great challenges\nof dealing with a case like this"},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"is you're trying to tell\nto arguably rational people,"},"564":{"dur":3,"text":"something that is irrational;\nit's incredibly hard to understand."},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"But one of the little insights\nwe had into Ricky"},"570":{"dur":1,"text":"was there was a picture of Oscar-Lee"},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"and a picture of Jeremy Guillory,"},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"and Oscar-Lee's own aunt\ncouldn't tell them apart."},"577":{"dur":4,"text":"Perhaps that was a little insight\ninto what Ricky was feeling or seeing."},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"But no question he killed this poor child."},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"He was sentenced to death,\nfirst time round."},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"The jurors accepted he was mentally ill."},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"They said, \"Yeah, but he's dangerous,\nwe better kill him.\""},"591":{"dur":1,"text":"We got him a new trial,"},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"and before the new trial,\nI got to know Ricky a lot better,"},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"and I got to know Lorelei, the mother\nof the small child who had been killed."},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"Lorelei was a fascinating,\nfascinating character."},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"She was a recovering alcoholic,\nvery little education,"},"605":{"dur":3,"text":"but full of the most immense compassion."},"608":{"dur":3,"text":"What she wanted most of all,\nas the mother of a victim."},"611":{"dur":4,"text":"was to understand \"Why?\";\nto understand why this had happened."},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"I was talking to her and I was saying,"},"617":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Look, if you really want to understand,\nyou are very welcome to talk to Ricky."},"621":{"dur":3,"text":"I know that would be difficult,\nbut Ricky would love to talk to you;"},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"to apologise because he knows\nhe took the life of your child,"},"627":{"dur":4,"text":"but to explain a little bit\nabout how mentally ill he is."},"631":{"dur":3,"text":"I think if you do that,\nit won't totally explain everything,"},"635":{"dur":4,"text":"because it was an irrational act,\nbut it will help you.\""},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"And it was immense tribute,\nI think, to Lorelei, that she said,"},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Yeah, I'm going to do that.\""},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"So she goes down to the jail,\nall by herself, to see Ricky."},"646":{"dur":1,"text":"I'd said, \"Look, talk to Ricky,"},"648":{"dur":1,"text":"if you don't like what he says,"},"649":{"dur":3,"text":"you can testify against him,\nI don't mind, this is just for you.\""},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"So she goes in there,\nshe had always called him \"Langley\"."},"656":{"dur":3,"text":"Obviously, she had it in\nfor him at the beginning."},"660":{"dur":4,"text":"She sat down, Ricky explained all of his\nlife history and he apologized to her."},"665":{"dur":1,"text":"At the very end of three hours"},"666":{"dur":3,"text":"talking to the person\nwho had murdered her six-year old,"},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"she says to him,\nfirst time calling him \"Ricky\","},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"she says, \"Ricky,\nI'm going to fight for you!\""},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"And she leaves that jail,\nshe goes down to the DA's office,"},"678":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm not going to mention who it was,\nI really didn't like the guy,"},"681":{"dur":4,"text":"and goes into his office,\nand explains all of this."},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"Says, \"I think Ricky Langley\nwas mentally ill,"},"688":{"dur":3,"text":"and I don't want\nthis death penalty nonsense."},"692":{"dur":3,"text":"It's just going to put me through\nthe pain again, dreadful stuff,"},"695":{"dur":1,"text":"not going to solve anything.\""},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"And the DA says to her, she says,"},"698":{"dur":5,"text":"\"Miss Guillory, you're a very strange\ncriminal defendant, I mean, victim.\""},"704":{"dur":3,"text":"And then, he proceeded to seek\nthe death penalty again, anyhow."},"708":{"dur":3,"text":"Indeed, the authorities tried to take\naway her other child,"},"712":{"dur":3,"text":"because she was an unfit mother,\nbecause she took a strange approach"},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"to the person\nwho had killed her first child."},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"Anyway, we get to the trial,\nand one of the lovely things"},"720":{"dur":2,"text":"- I love about doing\ncapital trials in America"},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"is you get to ask people\nall sorts of questions -"},"725":{"dur":1,"text":"I would love to do it to you,"},"726":{"dur":3,"text":"\"You're under oath, you have to answer\nwhatever I ask you.\""},"730":{"dur":1,"text":"It's great fun."},"731":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"732":{"dur":4,"text":"Great fun for me,\nnot for you, it really is."},"736":{"dur":4,"text":"So I was picking this jury,\nand they were lovely people."},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"We got 12 people\nwho've had close family relatives"},"743":{"dur":1,"text":"who had serious mental disorders,"},"745":{"dur":1,"text":"who really understood a lot of it."},"746":{"dur":3,"text":"And they laughed\nat the pathetic weak jokes I would tell,"},"750":{"dur":4,"text":"so I was confident that the outcome\nwas going to be okay at this trial,"},"754":{"dur":3,"text":"because they really\ndidn't like the prosecutor."},"758":{"dur":1,"text":"So I talked to Lorelei;"},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"and in a death penalty case\nin America, there are two trials."},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"The first is whether you are guilty\nof capital murder or not,"},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"and only if you are guilty\nof capital murder"},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"do you get to the second,\nwhich is life or death;"},"770":{"dur":2,"text":"do you get the life sentence\nor the death penalty."},"772":{"dur":2,"text":"I said to Lorelei, \"Look,\nthese people are nice people,"},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"they are not going to convict him\nor capital murder,"},"777":{"dur":4,"text":"You won't get the chance you wanted\nwhich was to testify at the penalty phase,"},"782":{"dur":3,"text":"to say that the death penalty\nwould have a dreadful impact on you."},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"You are just not going to get that chance."},"788":{"dur":4,"text":"I just need to tell you that, because\nI'm afraid that's what is going to happen."},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm very happy, but I'm sorry for you.\""},"795":{"dur":3,"text":"So she went away that night,\nvery religious, and she prayed,"},"798":{"dur":2,"text":"and she came back\nthe next morning, and she said,"},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"\"The logic of my position, is...\""},"803":{"dur":3,"text":"She said it in a much more\nSouthern Louisiana accent,"},"806":{"dur":4,"text":"\"The logic of my position\nis that he's mentally ill,"},"811":{"dur":3,"text":"he shouldn't be in prison;\nhe should be in a mental hospital."},"815":{"dur":3,"text":"I want to testify that he should be found\n'not guilty by reason of insanity'"},"818":{"dur":3,"text":"because he was insane\nat the time he killed my child.\""},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"I said, \"Alright.\""},"824":{"dur":3,"text":"She said, \"One thing I really need\nthough, is a guarantee;"},"827":{"dur":2,"text":"that he'll never be released\nfrom the mental hospital"},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"to harm another child.\""},"832":{"dur":1,"text":"I said, \"That's easy.\""},"833":{"dur":1,"text":"Ricky only wants that."},"835":{"dur":1,"text":"He wanted to be a guinea pig"},"837":{"dur":3,"text":"because he knew what he was,\nin a way, what he'd been made,"},"842":{"dur":2,"text":"One of the things about this,\nnot withstanding,"},"844":{"dur":2,"text":"what the \"News of The World\"\nused to always do,"},"847":{"dur":4,"text":"is there's no one who hates Ricky Langley\nmore than Ricky Langley."},"851":{"dur":3,"text":"And he wanted to be a guinea-pig\nso he could be studied,"},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"so that other people wouldn't suffer\nwhat he had suffered,"},"858":{"dur":3,"text":"and that other children\nwouldn't suffer what he had caused."},"861":{"dur":2,"text":"So, he signed off on whatever\nhe had to sign off on,"},"863":{"dur":3,"text":"and I said to Lorelei, \"What do you want\nme to ask you as a witness?\""},"867":{"dur":1,"text":"And she says, \"Just ask me one question.\""},"869":{"dur":1,"text":"So I did."},"871":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm sorry, this stuff always\nmakes me a bit chokey,"},"874":{"dur":4,"text":"when I talk about this with Lorelei\nbecause it was a remarkable human
