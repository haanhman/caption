pattern."},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"So we just spent a couple hours figuring out that pattern"},"520":{"dur":3,"text":"so that in the end, we throw away all of the messy HTML,"},"524":{"dur":3,"text":"all of the aesthetics of bold facing and italics and the like,"},"527":{"dur":5,"text":"and what we are then able to do is expose that same data."},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"For instance, in this way."},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"So we, according to the documentation here,"},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"have informed the world that if you request a

end-date time, start-date time, meal and so forth,"},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"what our servers will return to you, for instance,"},"554":{"dur":4,"text":"is a CSV file, comma separted values like an

whether you dive into this API"},"578":{"dur":3,"text":"or any other of CS50's or anything out there on the Internet,"},"581":{"dur":4,"text":"or not at all, realize that the world has increasingly started to standardize"},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"how machines intercommunicate."},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"We use standard data formats like CSV or JSON."},"590":{"dur":3,"text":"And what this means for

lets them get text alerts"},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"when their favorite meal is about to be served in some d-hall"},"602":{"dur":4,"text":"by using someone else's data sets and building on top of their APIs."},"607":{"dur":6,"text":"So more on that in the form of seminars and the documentation that you have here online."},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"So those, then, are APIs."},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"That

HTTP."},"3407":{"dur":2,"text":"Its number is 80."},"3410":{"dur":5,"text":"HTTP also uses number 443, but more specifically, for encrypted HTTPS."},"3415":{"dur":4,"text":"Whenever you see the s, for

something called 22 for SSH,"},"3429":{"dur":2,"text":"and there's a whole bunch of other ports out there."},"3431":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, we humans rarely see these numbers."},"3434":{"dur":7,"text":"However, when you type in an address like http:\/\/www.facebook.com,"},"3441":{"dur":4,"text":"the browser is secretly inserting 80, because you're using HTTP."},"3446":{"dur":4,"text":"If you, instead, type HTTPS, it's secretly inserting 443."},"3450":{"dur":4,"text":"And we can kind of see this manually if I pull up a

that I want to talk to, and hit enter."},"3467":{"dur":2,"text":"Notice it disappears, because the browser assumes,"},"3470":{"dur":3,"text":"oh, 80, I'm not even going to bother showing that to you."},"3473":{"dur":3,"text":"But the reason for this is that if I actually wanted to send someone an email,"},"3476":{"dur":5,"text":"I would really be sending it to them on port 25, that being SMTP."},"3482":{"dur":2,"text":"A bit of an oversimplification, but some of you have friends"},"3484":{"dur":4,"text":"who actually work at Facebook, and they, similarly, have servers that receive email."},"3489":{"dur":3,"text":"Any time you send an email, what gmail is doing for you"},"3492":{"dur":2,"text":"or Outlook or whatever program you use,"},"3494":{"dur":4,"text":"it's sort of
