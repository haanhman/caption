it\u2019s in this beautiful burgundy color, it\u2019s perfect for fall"},"162":{"dur":4,"text":"and I love it because it\u2019s a tint and it\u2019s not so thick as a lipstick"},"166":{"dur":1,"text":"so if you want to go for a dark lip"},"168":{"dur":3,"text":"but just want to tone it down a little bit and use a tint this is for you"},"172":{"dur":2,"text":"I think I used it in my full makeup tutorial"},"174":{"dur":4,"text":"and the other thing you can do with this is if you are wearing a burgundy sort of lipstick"},"179":{"dur":4,"text":"you can actually stain your lips with this underneath first so you can keep the color"},"183":{"dur":3,"text":"so as your lipstick rubs off the color is not all going away"},"186":{"dur":2,"text":"so this is perfect for that, I love it"},"189":{"dur":3,"text":"next one is from 3CE, this is a lip crayon"},"192":{"dur":3,"text":"and I love the crayons because it\u2019s so much easier to apply"},"196":{"dur":5,"text":"and this is a true orange and I love 3CE products the color payoff is quite good"},"201":{"dur":3,"text":"but this can make your lips a little bit dry so make sure you

Long Wear Essence Lipstick"},"246":{"dur":1,"text":"and it\u2019s got sunscreen which is great,"},"248":{"dur":4,"text":"because we always forget to protect our lips from the sun at least I always forget"},"252":{"dur":4,"text":"and when I put sunscreen on my lips and I eat.. it just.. I just know it rubs off"},"256":{"dur":3,"text":"but then I am too lazy to reapply, story of my life"},"260":{"dur":5,"text":"these two colors that I got are beautiful, one is this beautiful peach coral"},"266":{"dur":5,"text":"you\u2019ll start to see a little bit of a pattern, that I just love this kind of peachy coraly colors"},"271":{"dur":4,"text":"and the other one is this beautiful red, is a super bright red"},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"but it\u2019s an orangey sort of yellow tone"},"278":{"dur":4,"text":"not very slippery to apply, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s supposed to be long lasting"},"282":{"dur":5,"text":"but the pigmentation is amazing, they were on sale so I could not resist,"},"288":{"dur":3,"text":"the next two lipsticks are the same ones I\u2019m gonna be giving away"},"291":{"dur":6,"text":"I think they are by Etude house, they are called dear my lips or something,"},"297":{"dur":1,"text":"so this is what happens when you throw away the box"},"299":{"dur":3,"text":"but I can\u2019t not throw it away because I\u2019m running out of space in my apartment"},"302":{"dur":1,"text":"I can\u2019t just hold packaging like I used to,"},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"I\u2019ll put the name of these down below for you guys"},"307":{"dur":3,"text":"so the two colors that I got on this range"},"310":{"dur":4,"text":"is this beautiful dusty rose that I\u2019m totally in love with"},"315":{"dur":6,"text":"It\u2019s a very nice sort of nude rose, the other color is again a peachy coral"},"321":{"dur":5,"text":"I\u2019m so predictable guys, this is like the same color as everything else that I just got"},"327":{"dur":3,"text":"the thing I love about them is they are super super pigmented"},"330":{"dur":3,"text":"not all Etude House lipsticks are very pigmented"},"334":{"dur":4,"text":"a lot of them are quite sheer but this particular range was by far the best"},"338":{"dur":4,"text":"and I always look for really really pigmented lipsticks because of my dark lips"},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"the color on my lips which is amazing"},"345":{"dur":3,"text":"make sure you enter the giveaway because these are so good"},"348":{"dur":4,"text":"these are all the lips products that I got, we are moving onto the eye products now."},"353":{"dur":5,"text":"So the first one has been a go to for like the past two months or so"},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"but this eyebrow pencil is from The Face Shop"},"361":{"dur":3,"text":"it\u2019s called the Browmaster Waterproof Eyebrow Pencil"},"365":{"dur":4,"text":"and I\u2019m in love with this, the color, the formulation, everything"},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"I\u2019ve used it so much, even the little brush tip at the top like fell off"},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"if you\u2019ve been wondering what I\u2019ve been using on my eyebrows"},"375":{"dur":3,"text":"this one is actually a very light gray color,"},"379":{"dur":4,"text":"perfect for ash tone hair, like if you have blue hair or like a dark blue, dark purple"},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"not too pigmented it\u2019s quite light,"},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"so you are not going to get heavy drawn on brow look,"},"388":{"dur":1,"text":"it\u2019s gonna look very very natural"},"390":{"dur":4,"text":"and because the formulation is a little bit waxy and crayony"},"395":{"dur":3,"text":"it keeps your hairs in place and it\u2019s supposed to be waterproof"},"398":{"dur":3,"text":"and I find that this lasts really well in the summer"},"402":{"dur":5,"text":"so it comes in such a huge range of colors I think 6, 7 or 8 colors"},"407":{"dur":3,"text":"so really check this range out, you can\u2019t go wrong with this,"},"410":{"dur":6,"text":"the other thing I\u2019ve been really loving is this Innisfree Microcara, It\u2019s called skinny Microcara"},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"I use this in my everyday makeup tutorial,"},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"so you guys would\u2019ve seen me rave about it there,"},"421":{"dur":5,"text":"it\u2019s got the skinniest one in the world, like I have not seen a skinnier one,"},"427":{"dur":3,"text":"I used to use the Maybelline Lash Discovery on my lower lashes,"},"431":{"dur":3,"text":"because my lower lashes are tiny, but even that was a tiny one,"},"435":{"dur":3,"text":"but this is by far, like the tiniest one that I\u2019ve seen"},"438":{"dur":3,"text":"and it really helps you get into the little hairs,"},"442":{"dur":3,"text":"if you have really fine hair on your lower lashes this will save your life"},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"it doesn\u2019t actually build a lot of volume"},"448":{"dur":3,"text":"but it does give you some decent length"},"452":{"dur":3,"text":"and it comes in a range of colors, I think it comes in like a brown, a dark brown,"},"455":{"dur":3,"text":"a soft black and maybe like a dark black, so you have some options"},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"and then I have these two eyeshadows, one is from A\u2019Pieu"},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"I seriously am butchering this name if I\u2019m pronouncing it wrong,"},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"if anyone know how to pronounce this brand name, let me know"},"469":{"dur":5,"text":"this is the Creamy Butter Shadow and it\u2019s in this beautiful burgundy color,"},"474":{"dur":3,"text":"the reason why I got this shadow is because it was in a burgundy color,"},"477":{"dur":4,"text":"but then I haven\u2019t used it because I feel like when I use it I look like I\u2019ve been punched in the face"},"482":{"dur":5,"text":"if you don\u2019t use it properly, so I.. I just got this, the formulation is really buttery"},"487":{"dur":3,"text":"the only thing about butter formulation is it tends to crease"},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"if you put a little bit too much and you don\u2019t put primer on you eyes,"},"494":{"dur":4,"text":"the other thing I bought I think is from Aritaum, but this is Shine Fix Eyes"},"499":{"dur":4,"text":"and it\u2019s a very popular loose powder, unlike other eyeshadows loose powders,"},"503":{"dur":4,"text":"they have this little top thing that pads the powder in,"},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"so when you open it doesn\u2019t like fly everywhere,"},"511":{"dur":4,"text":"is not until you use brush to loosen it up that it does become loose"},"515":{"dur":4,"text":"and I got this because in such a beautiful like a bright orangey pink,"},"520":{"dur":4,"text":"it\u2019s got like a gold reflection as well, but I\u2019m in love with this color"},"524":{"dur":1,"text":"I don\u2019t know when I am going to be using it,"},"525":{"dur":4,"text":"but I\u2019m definitely going to pop it out some time because it is pretty"},"530":{"dur":6,"text":"the color number is 6, it comes in like a huge range of colors guys, like you can\u2019t even choose,"},"536":{"dur":3,"text":"so I bought a bunch of blushes as well because I love blush,"},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"the first one I\u2019m going to be talking about is this one,"},"544":{"dur":5,"text":"it\u2019s also from A\u2019Pieu, it\u2019s called the Bal Cheek Han Cheek, comes in range of colors,"},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"I think there is about 3 or 4 colors,"},"551":{"dur":4,"text":"I got the lavender because I actually really love lavender blush"},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"and I feel like no many brands released lavender blush,"},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"I really love lavender blush because I feel like it brightens your face a lot"},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"so that\u2019s what it looks like,"},"567":{"dur":5,"text":"I almost look like a cartoon, you know how it.. yeah.. cartoon cheeks"},"573":{"dur":3,"text":"and then is just this creamy formulation that you blend out"},"579":{"dur":5,"text":"I really like cream blushes because my skin gets dry especially in the winter time"},"585":{"dur":4,"text":"and the last thing I want is to make this area look really really dry,"},"590":{"dur":6,"text":"so I really love sort of creamy and tinted blushes as you realize, but.."},"598":{"dur":3,"text":"it has this little sponge thing and you squeeze it out into the sponge"},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"lavender has been super trendy color in Korea"},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"because of the fact that it really cancels out the sallowness"},"608":{"dur":3,"text":"so a lot of creams have been using lavender color,"},"611":{"dur":4,"text":"CC creams or bases to cancel out the yellowness on the skin"},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"and it makes your skin look milky if you have like a yellow tone skin"},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"and you want that sort of pinkish or white tone"},"622":{"dur":3,"text":"but I find that lavender blush kind of makes you cheeks look fuller"},"625":{"dur":5,"text":"because of the fact that it just tends to be really brightening and light as you can see right now"},"631":{"dur":3,"text":"it makes my cheeks to look really rounded, I find.."},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"rounded, I find.."},"639":{"dur":4,"text":"the next product is also from A\u2019Pieu, this is the Whipping Mousse Blusher,"},"643":{"dur":7,"text":"it\u2019s also a tint cream blusher, this is in an orangey peach color, more of a true orange"},"651":{"dur":4,"text":"but I love this as well because you can just blend it out and it looks super natural on"},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"kind of has a little bit of a powder finish at the end of it, which is awesome."},"659":{"dur":4,"text":"Last blush that I have is this Tony Moly Cristal Blusher it\u2019s in a peach,"},"664":{"dur":4,"text":"this blush isn\u2019t actually very pigmented so it\u2019s very chalky,"},"668":{"dur":3,"text":"which may sound horrible to you guys in a blush"},"671":{"dur":3,"text":"but if you are a beginner and you don\u2019t want to mess up your blush application"},"675":{"dur":4,"text":"getting a chalkier and less pigmented blush in my own opinion"},"680":{"dur":3,"text":"will actually be easier to work with, because you can build up the color however you want"},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"instead of applying too much color at once"},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"so I\u2019m going to hop up onto the skincare now and thank you so much Liah,"},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"we did the chubby bunny challenge together,"},"692":{"dur":4,"text":"so if you guys haven\u2019t watch it go check out, she brought this from Korea for me"},"696":{"dur":5,"text":"it\u2019s the Green Tea Fresh Cream from Innisfree, and oh my god it\u2019s so fresh,"},"701":{"dur":4,"text":"like it\u2019s very cooling, it almost look like an aloe vera gel, it\u2019s kind of like jelly,"},"706":{"dur":4,"text":"but it\u2019s the perfect moisturizer for summer, it\u2019s so light at the same time,"},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"very very moisturizing, I\u2019m super happy with this."},"713":{"dur":3,"text":"The other skincare item I got needs not mention because I did a whole video on it,"},"717":{"dur":6,"text":"This is the Elizavecca Milky Piggy Carbonated Bubble Clay Mask, oh my god that is a mouthful,"},"723":{"dur":4,"text":"but it\u2019s like so fun, it basically bubbles on your face, check the video out,"},"728":{"dur":5,"text":"I tried it in a whole separate video, so I\u2019m not gonna be talking more about it, but this is super fun"},"733":{"dur":5,"text":"The other thing I\u2019ve been loving is this Blackhead Out White Clay Nose Pack from The Face Shop"},"738":{"dur":5,"text":"I hoarded this, I got like 3 or 4 of these that I got from Ebay for like super cheap"},"743":{"dur":3,"text":"but this is kind of like the equivalent of a Bior\u00e9 nose strip,"},"747":{"dur":4,"text":"you put it on, it feels like a very thick clay, but then it dries into a strip"},"752":{"dur":4,"text":"and you just pull the whole thing out with you little like scary things in your pores"},"757":{"dur":3,"text":"I absolutely love to look at, I will stare at them all day after I pull it out,"},"761":{"dur":3,"text":"and it\u2019s like this sense of satisfaction that you actually pull it out,"},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"replaced Bior\u00e9 pore strips for me"},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"because you can mold this to whatever shape you\u2019d like"},"769":{"dur":2,"text":"and apply it to areas of your face as well,"},"772":{"dur":5,"text":"so I cannot finish a Korean skincare haul section without these masks,"},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"I got these ones, they are so funny,"},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"I\u2019m sure you guys have seen animal masks on Instagram or Facebook or something"},"783":{"dur":3,"text":"but I got a tiger one, this is a whitening collagen pack,"},"787":{"dur":4,"text":"I got a super panda also a whitening collagen pack,"},"791":{"dur":3,"text":"and I got this super puppy which actually looks more like a seal,"},"795":{"dur":4,"text":"umh this is a whitening honey pack, so I\u2019ll be using these,"},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"they\u2019ll be so fun and maybe scare some people as well,"},"802":{"dur":4,"text":"this is not a cream product but my wifey my best friend just came back from Japan,"},"806":{"dur":4,"text":"and she got me this mask, it\u2019s so funny, it says \u201cwill you be a cat?\u201d on it"},"811":{"dur":4,"text":"and it\u2019s a cat printed mask, how cute is that, she knows I\u2019m a crazy cat lady,"},"815":{"dur":3,"text":"she had to get this for me, now.. ok, I am obsessed with cushion foundations,"},"819":{"dur":7,"text":"so thank you Liah again for getting me this Mamonde Cover Powder Cushion,"},"826":{"dur":5,"text":"I haven\u2019t used it yet only because I don\u2019t like opening cushions until I finish my other cushions"},"831":{"dur":4,"text":"because they do actually dry out from exposure to air so I just kept this,"},"836":{"dur":1,"text":"I can\u2019t wait to use this,"},"837":{"dur":5,"text":"Mamonde was a brand that made my favorite cleansing tissues that I\u2019ve used"},"842":{"dur":3,"text":"I got two boxes of it already, so I can\u2019t wait to try this out"},"846":{"dur":2,"text":"and plus the packaging is so cute,"},"848":{"dur":4,"text":"one of my favorites at the moment is this Iope Air Cushion XP,"},"852":{"dur":4,"text":"I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen me use it in a tutorial, I still have a refill here,"},"857":{"dur":5,"text":"I think I placed the cushion somewhere in one of my makeup pouches and I forgot which one,"},"862":{"dur":5,"text":"but this is a really great cushion for those of you guys that aren\u2019t a huge fan of dewy cushions"},"868":{"dur":4,"text":"because this is more of a matte formulation and it has a little bit more of a coverage,"},"872":{"dur":5,"text":"is one of the newer models and Iope was kind of the.. one of the originators of cushions"},"877":{"dur":2,"text":"so they are a really popular brand in Korea"},"880":{"dur":4,"text":"and what I find with this range is it has a bigger color range, although in general"},"885":{"dur":6,"text":"I feel like fundations colors in Korea are very limited to pale and very pale and very very pale,"},"891":{"dur":5,"text":"this is in a color 123 and it wasn\u2019t the darkest color actually,"},"897":{"dur":4,"text":"it\u2019s perfect for me in winter time but in summer right now is a little bit pale,"},"901":{"dur":1,"text":"which is why I haven\u2019t been using it"},"903":{"dur":4,"text":"but for those of you guys that are looking for just a slightly bigger range of color options,"},"907":{"dur":1,"text":"have a look at Iope,"},"909":{"dur":5,"text":"again Iope is actually considered quite tan when it comes to Korean foundation product,"},"914":{"dur":2,"text":"even though it\u2019s considered very very pale here,"},"917":{"dur":5,"text":"I got this CC Balm Compact from Dr. Jart+, now I really love the serum medium cream"},"922":{"dur":3,"text":"is a skincare product that I used to rave about all the time,"},"925":{"dur":4,"text":"so I decided to have a look at this CC Balm because it says it was moisturizing"},"930":{"dur":2,"text":"and it\u2019s got this really cute swell pattern"},"932":{"dur":2,"text":"and the white stuff is supposed to be some sort of essence"},"934":{"dur":3,"text":"but for some reason I don\u2019t really like the texture"},"938":{"dur":3,"text":"..and in some of my wrinkle areas and creases,"},"942":{"dur":3,"text":"I might give this more of chance, I don\u2019t preferred it right now,"},"945":{"dur":5,"text":"but I might pop it out in the winter time and see If can give this another go, this was expensive,"},"950":{"dur":3,"text":"now that we\u2019ve covered cushion foundations I have some finishing powders,"},"953":{"dur":3,"text":"so this one is the Innisfree No Sebum Blut Powder"},"957":{"dur":3,"text":"and it\u2019s a perfect setting powder for those of you guys that get some shiny spots"},"961":{"dur":4,"text":"this is going to take that away, it\u2019s a beautiful skin color,"},"966":{"dur":3,"text":"the other two I have are more interesting I find,"},"969":{"dur":5,"text":"so the first one I\u2019m going to talk about is this CC Magic Shine Powder from A\u2019Pieu"},"974":{"dur":1,"text":"again more A\u2019Pieu stuff"},"975":{"dur":4,"text":"this has SPF27+ which is awesome but it means you get a white cast"},"980":{"dur":2,"text":"when someone uses flash photography,"},"982":{"dur":5,"text":"it\u2019s in a beautiful pink with a golden or beige gold kind of reflection"},"988":{"dur":3,"text":"you can use this as more of a highlighter and a shine powder"},"992":{"dur":2,"text":"to just give a nice sheen to the face,"},"994":{"dur":4,"text":"the other one is very very interesting it\u2019s called the Nature 8-Mineral Skin Powder"},"998":{"dur":7,"text":"it\u2019s in a lavender color and as you know lavender is perfect for neutralizing any sallowness"},"1005":{"dur":2,"text":"I haven\u2019t used it yet but I plan to pop it out and give it go"},"1008":{"dur":2,"text":"and I will let you guys know what I think about it,"},"1011":{"dur":3,"text":"we got through it guys, yes! I can go get some coffee now."},"1015":{"dur":3,"text":"Let me know which products you found the most interesting and you want to try"},"1018":{"dur":3,"text":"and remember to enter the giveaway because I\u2019m looking forward to sharing these lipsticks"},"1022":{"dur":3,"text":"in case you miss out in some of my older videos I put them here for you guys"},"1025":{"dur":4,"text":"and on Saturday I actually have a morning routine with an awesome healthy breakfast recipes"},"1030":{"dur":1,"text":"so I can\u2019t wait to share that"},"1031":{"dur":2,"text":"don\u2019t forget that I love you guys so so so much"},"1033":{"dur":3,"text":"and I\u2019ll see you guys right back here on my channel on Saturday."},"1036":{"dur":1,"text":"Bye."}}
