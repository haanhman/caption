{"0":{"dur":7,"text":"Translator: Astrid Breuer\nReviewer: Els De Keyser"},"17":{"dur":6,"text":"So these are West African elephants, \nand there are just 550 left in Mali."},"24":{"dur":2,"text":"Now that might not sound like much,"},"26":{"dur":3,"text":"but it's 12% of the whole \nWest African population."},"29":{"dur":5,"text":"And, they make the longest, and most \nfascinating migration of all elephants."},"36":{"dur":3,"text":"In 2006, after 3 years of study,"},"39":{"dur":3,"text":"We realized, that if things didn't \nturn around very soon,"},"43":{"dur":3,"text":"they would be gone...gone!"},"48":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, our first thought was to take \nthe conventional approach, you know."},"52":{"dur":3,"text":"You analyse the problem, \nyou make a solution,"},"56":{"dur":2,"text":"and then you make a grand plan."},"59":{"dur":2,"text":"And then the government does nothing."},"63":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, we decided not to take that approach."},"65":{"dur":2,"text":"We just didn't have time,"},"68":{"dur":3,"text":"and we discovered that a lot \nwould depend on people."},"72":{"dur":3,"text":"Now we were able to track these elephants,"},"75":{"dur":3,"text":"because some of them had been fitted \nwith GPS collars."},"78":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we knew their position \nevery two hours"},"80":{"dur":3,"text":"over a period of 18 months."},"83":{"dur":1,"text":"And we could see, for example,"},"85":{"dur":2,"text":"that when you put the points \non top of a satellite image,"},"88":{"dur":1,"text":"you could see, for example,"},"90":{"dur":4,"text":"that they spent the whole of the dry season \nin the north of their range."},"94":{"dur":2,"text":"And then when you zoomed in,"},"97":{"dur":4,"text":"you could see that they spent \nmost of their time around little lakes."},"101":{"dur":3,"text":"And as one lake dried up, \nthey'd move on to another one,"},"104":{"dur":2,"text":"then onto another one, and another one,"},"106":{"dur":4,"text":"until they ended up at the one lake \nwhich never dried, Lake Banzena."},"112":{"dur":3,"text":"Then, when they could smell \nthat it was raining,"},"116":{"dur":2,"text":"off in the South, off they'd go."},"119":{"dur":4,"text":"Because in the South, there's really, \nreally good food, but no lakes."},"123":{"dur":3,"text":"So they could only be there \nwhile it was raining."},"127":{"dur":2,"text":"But that wasn't the whole story."},"129":{"dur":4,"text":"When they got to the South, they didn't \ndisperse, as you might expect."},"135":{"dur":3,"text":"But they stayed in one confined place."},"138":{"dur":3,"text":"And we discovered that the local chief, \nhe was a pastoralist."},"142":{"dur":2,"text":"And he was also very powerful."},"144":{"dur":4,"text":"And he'd managed to prevent \nanybody from clearing this land."},"149":{"dur":3,"text":"And so they found a haven, \nand lots of good food,"},"152":{"dur":2,"text":"just at the time of the year \nwhen they needed it,"},"155":{"dur":2,"text":"when they were having their babies."},"158":{"dur":2,"text":"Now when we first started \nstudying this area,"},"161":{"dur":4,"text":"it was completely degraded, \noverused, overexploited."},"165":{"dur":2,"text":"People were clearing land, \nthey were cutting forest."},"168":{"dur":2,"text":"And they were threatening \nto completely cut"},"170":{"dur":3,"text":"the elephant migration route."},"173":{"dur":2,"text":"Increasing herds of cattle \nwere trampling the soil"},"176":{"dur":1,"text":"and drinking the lakes dry."},"178":{"dur":3,"text":"And the elephants were coming to rely \nmore and more on Lake Banzena,"},"181":{"dur":4,"text":"just as human occupation \naround that lake was increasing."},"187":{"dur":2,"text":"It was clear a crisis was imminent,"},"190":{"dur":2,"text":"but what could we do?"},"193":{"dur":2,"text":"We had an area the size of Switzerland."},"195":{"dur":3,"text":"We had two ranger posts, with no vehicles."},"199":{"dur":1,"text":"We had no money, at all."},"201":{"dur":4,"text":"There was no government morale, \nand no political will."},"206":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, everything we thought of doing \njust seemed utterly futile."},"211":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, we had to think again,"},"213":{"dur":2,"text":"we had to take a step back."},"215":{"dur":2,"text":"And we thought, well actually,"},"218":{"dur":4,"text":"instead of raising loads of resources \nto try and impose our grand plan,"},"223":{"dur":1,"text":"what we really wanted,"},"224":{"dur":4,"text":"was for the relationship between humans, \nelephants, and the environment,"},"229":{"dur":4,"text":"to automatically result \nin elephant conservation."},"233":{"dur":3,"text":"And for that, we needed a shared vision."},"237":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we talked to everybody."},"242":{"dur":1,"text":"We talked to everybody."},"245":{"dur":3,"text":"We showed them our results, and we \nasked them what they thought of it."},"249":{"dur":2,"text":"And we talked to them about their lives"},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"and about the elephants."},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"And we discovered \nthat many of them said,"},"255":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Well we don't want \nelephants to disappear,"},"257":{"dur":6,"text":"because if elephants disappear, it means \nthe environment is no longer good for us.\""},"265":{"dur":3,"text":"So we created all kinds of \neducational materials"},"269":{"dur":1,"text":"about how to live with elephants."},"270":{"dur":1,"text":"We started a schools program,"},"272":{"dur":3,"text":"and Malians came to take pride \nin their elephants."},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"And villagers were saying to us,"},"278":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Well, if the elephants disappear,"},"280":{"dur":3,"text":"our area is no longer special.\""},"284":{"dur":3,"text":"But then, the crisis we all feared."},"287":{"dur":4,"text":"In 2009, Lake Banzena \ndried up completely."},"292":{"dur":4,"text":"It was drunk dry by over 50,000 cattle."},"297":{"dur":1,"text":"What to do?"},"299":{"dur":1,"text":"In the past, government foresters from Timbuktu"},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"had tried evicting everybody."},"304":{"dur":3,"text":"But they all gradually \njust came back again,"},"307":{"dur":1,"text":"and so we tried something else."},"309":{"dur":5,"text":"We talked, we spoke to every single \nhousehold living around the Lake."},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"And we asked them about their lives."},"317":{"dur":4,"text":"And we discovered that over 96% \nof the cattle using that lake"},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"didn't belong to the local people at all,"},"325":{"dur":3,"text":"but to wealthy urban Malians \nliving hundreds of miles away,"},"329":{"dur":3,"text":"who'd amass these enormous herds \nas signs of prestige,"},"333":{"dur":2,"text":"and then send them off \nto find food and water."},"336":{"dur":3,"text":"We discovered that over 50% \nof the local population"},"340":{"dur":2,"text":"suffered from water-borne disease,\nand were willing to move,"},"342":{"dur":4,"text":"if they could find somewhere \nwith good pasture and clean water."},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that's what happened."},"349":{"dur":3,"text":"We raised some money, \ndrilled deep for water,"},"352":{"dur":4,"text":"and a few months later, \nthe women said to us,"},"357":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Since we moved here, we no longer \nhave stomach aches."},"361":{"dur":3,"text":"The men can go back to Banzena \nif they want,"},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"but we're staying here.\"\n(Laughter)"},"368":{"dur":1,"text":"But there's more."},"370":{"dur":2,"text":"The reason this area was so degraded,"},"373":{"dur":4,"text":"was because there were no commonly \naccepted rules of resource management."},"378":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we brought all the different \nclans and ethnicities together"},"381":{"dur":1,"text":"to discuss this problem."},"384":{"dur":5,"text":"And they created a management committee, \ncomposed of elders, who made some rules."},"390":{"dur":3,"text":"And they created \nthese patrols of young men,"},"393":{"dur":3,"text":"who worked with government foresters \nto enforce those rules."},"397":{"dur":1,"text":"And they protected forests,"},"399":{"dur":2,"text":"they protected the elephant migration route,"},"401":{"dur":1,"text":"they controlled hunting."},"403":{"dur":3,"text":"They charged the cattle for access to water."},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"And they set aside \nthis enormous pasture area,"},"409":{"dur":3,"text":"14 times the size of Manhattan."},"414":{"dur":4,"text":"Yeah, incredible; and we helped them \nprotect it with fire breaks."},"418":{"dur":1,"text":"And as a result,"},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"that was the only part \nof the whole of the North"},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"that didn't lose its pasture \nto fire that year."},"427":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, when the adjacent communities \nheard this, they all came clamoring,"},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"and saying, please, \nhelp us do the same thing."},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"And so everything \nwas going really well."},"435":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, we didn't have \nto persuade them at all,"},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"they all wanted to do this."},"440":{"dur":6,"text":"But then, there was \nthe crisis of 2012, the coup."},"447":{"dur":4,"text":"Overnight, government fled to the capital"},"452":{"dur":5,"text":"and the area was overrun by armed groups \nof Touareg rebels, jihadis."},"457":{"dur":4,"text":"It was awash with guns \nand completely lawless."},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, meanwhile in Central Africa \nelephants were being slaughtered"},"465":{"dur":3,"text":"and massacred by the hundreds"},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"for their ivory to fund war and rebellion."},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"Our hearts sunk, \nwe were a little project."},"475":{"dur":3,"text":"But the elephants needed us more than ever."},"479":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, we convened \na big community gathering."},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"4 days, for people to discuss \ntheir experiences,"},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"try and make sense \nof what was happening,"},"489":{"dur":4,"text":"talk about their problems, \nand how to protect the elephants."},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"And we discovered, \nthat one of their big problems"},"497":{"dur":4,"text":"was that they couldn't get food, because \nall the vehicles were being hijacked."},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we arranged for it to be brought in,"},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"grain, to be brought in, piecemeal, \nby donkey cart."},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"And the elders said to us, well,"},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"we'll transmit the message far and wide,"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"including to the leaders \nof the armed groups,"},"514":{"dur":4,"text":"that killing elephants \nis stealing from us."},"520":{"dur":3,"text":"But they were also very worried about \ntheir young men joining the armed groups."},"524":{"dur":3,"text":"Jihadis were paying \nbetween $30 and $50 dollars a day,"},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"a huge amount for these people."},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we created vigilance networks \nof young men"},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"throughout the elephant range,"},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"Who would look out for elephant killing"},"538":{"dur":3,"text":"and find out who were the perpetrators."},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"And, although we only paid them in food,"},"545":{"dur":3,"text":"not one of them joined the armed groups."},"549":{"dur":4,"text":"Because, they said, \nour work was more noble."},"555":{"dur":4,"text":"Only 8 elephants have been killed so far."},"560":{"dur":4,"text":"But there's been another result \nthat was unexpected."},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"By putting the spotlight on the elephants,"},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"the committed individuals \nwithin government"},"569":{"dur":4,"text":"came forward, and we were able \nto support them in their work."},"573":{"dur":4,"text":"And over the years, \nthey came to occupy the key positions."},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"And so government morale soared,"},"581":{"dur":3,"text":"and political will completely transformed."},"585":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, we have a model \nand it's working, so far."},"590":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm constantly astonished."},"593":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm continually in awe \nof the response of the people"},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"and of their achievements."},"600":{"dur":4,"text":"There is so much more to do, \nbut we can go forward."},"605":{"dur":3,"text":"All because we shifted our perspective."},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"We were willing to not know,"},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"to not have 'the answer,'"},"613":{"dur":3,"text":"and so we had to talk to people."},"617":{"dur":3,"text":"And we grew solutions, bit by bit,"},"620":{"dur":3,"text":"in partnership, and dialogue."},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"And so those solutions \nwere very adapted,"},"627":{"dur":3,"text":"and grounded in the local context."},"630":{"dur":3,"text":"And so by empowering our allies,"},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"people were not just the problem,"},"636":{"dur":4,"text":"but luckily, for the elephants, \nthey became the solution."},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"Thank you.\n(Applause)"}}
