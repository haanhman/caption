clinical implications"},"618":{"dur":3,"text":"of it before we do it, let's\njust dive in and do it."},"622":{"dur":3,"text":"So when I ask you to do since\nprobably most of you are very familiar"},"625":{"dur":7,"text":"with contemplative practice because it's the\ncenter of Naropa University's early origins"},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"and certainly it gives us time to say,"},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"well what is this inner world\nof our mental life really like?"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's dive in and explore it."},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"So what I ask you to do

exploration"},"663":{"dur":4,"text":"of different aspects of our\ninner and interpersonal lives."},"669":{"dur":5,"text":"And to begin with, just to give a little\nframework to the focus of attention"},"675":{"dur":5,"text":"which we'll be really playing with and exploring\nin just a moment, before we close our eyes,"},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"get ready for an inner practice,\nwe do bless

visual\nattention back to the far wall here."},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"And now, let your attention come\nback to the middle of the room"},"724":{"dur":8,"text":"and then bring your visual attention to about\nbook reading distance as if you had a book"},"732":{"dur":8,"text":"or magazine in your hands and just notice\nhow you can determine where attention goes."},"742":{"dur":5,"text":"And just like the common practice\nof focusing on the breath,"},"747":{"dur":5,"text":"let's just now let our attention find\nthe breath and just do a short bit"},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"of breath awareness practice,\nthe basic mindfulness practice"},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"of strengthening our attention,\nsometimes called the Shamatha"},"759":{"dur":6,"text":"but it's really a universal practice not just\nin Buddhist practice to focus on the breath."},"766":{"dur":5,"text":"And let's sense the breath wherever you feel it\nmost naturally, whether it's the air coming in"},"772":{"dur":11,"text":"and out of your nostrils or your chest rising\nand falling or the abdomen moving out and in."},"783":{"dur":5,"text":"Just let your attention ride the wave of the\nbreath,

]"},"814":{"dur":5,"text":"And just sensing the breath can bring\nus to a deep place beneath the surface"},"819":{"dur":5,"text":"of all the chatter of our thoughts,\nand memories, and images, and feelings"},"825":{"dur":6,"text":"and for people who feel safe in the\nwater, this can be a useful analogy"},"832":{"dur":3,"text":"to going beneath the surface of the ocean."},"836":{"dur":3,"text":"We're deep beneath the surface,\nit's calm and clear."},"841":{"dur":7,"text":"And from this deep place of tranquility and\nclarity, it's possible to just look upward"},"849":{"dur":4,"text":"at the surface and notice\nwhatever conditions are there."},"853":{"dur":1,"text":"It might be flat."},"856":{"dur":2,"text":"It might be rough

clear."},"870":{"dur":8,"text":"And so, we know from all sorts\nof studies that simply focusing"},"878":{"dur":8,"text":"on the breath can bring a deep sense of clarity\nand strength as it stabilizes our minds,"},"887":{"dur":5,"text":"and we'll talk a lot about that later on,\nbut for this practice we'll let the breath go"},"894":{"dur":5,"text":"and I'd like to introduce to you to a practice\nif you've never done it before that we do"},"899":{"dur":3,"text":"at the Mindsight Institute\ncalled the wheel of awareness."},"903":{"dur":5,"text":"And the idea that is simply this, if\nyou can imagine in your mind's eye"},"909":{"dur":5,"text":"if your eyes are closed or if you want to open\nthem and look at me I'll show you with my body,"},"914":{"dur":5,"text":"if you can imagine a large\nwheel with an outer rim"},"920":{"dur":5,"text":"and a smaller inner hub that's also a circle."},"927":{"dur":5,"text":"We'll be talking about this visual image and if\nyou're like me, it maybe hard for you to evoke,"},"933":{"dur":5,"text":"actually seeing the image and that's fine\nas long as you have the sense of the idea"},"938":{"dur":8,"text":"of a wheel with an outer rim and inner hub\nand imagine that there's a single spoke"},"946":{"dur":6,"text":"that can be moved around from the\nhub to various places on the rim."},"953":{"dur":2,"text":"So what I'd like you to imagine is this,"},"956":{"dur":8,"text":"is that the hub represents the experience\nwithin consciousness of knowing."},"966":{"dur":5,"text":"It's basically the most direct way."},"971":{"dur":5,"text":"The simplest way of defining what consciousness\nor awareness is, it's a sense of knowing."},"977":{"dur":6,"text":"And within consciousness, we not only have\nthe knowing which is represented in the hub,"},"984":{"dur":3,"text":"we have the known which could\ninclude for example,"},"988":{"dur":4,"text":"what you see with your eyes or\nwhat you hear with your ears."},"993":{"dur":5,"text":"And the known, which will go through\nas a review includes what's on the rim,"},"1000":{"dur":6,"text":"so the rim represents anything that we\ncan know about like what we see or hear."},"1007":{"dur":6,"text":"The hub represents the experience of\nknowing and the way we connect knowing"},"1014":{"dur":4,"text":"to the known is with the spoke of attention."},"1019":{"dur":7,"text":"So the spoke is the way we direct attention\nand we'll systematically move the spoke"},"1026":{"dur":5,"text":"around the rim, which if you\ncan picture it like a pizza,"},"1032":{"dur":4,"text":"we can divide that whole wheel\nof awareness into four segments."},"1038":{"dur":6,"text":"The first segment we'll review\nincludes our first five senses of sight,"},"1045":{"dur":4,"text":"hearing, smelling, tasting, and touching."},"1049":{"dur":6,"text":"We'll then move the spoke over to the next\nsegment of the four and this is the segment"},"1056":{"dur":4,"text":"of the rim representing our\ninternal bodily sense"},"1060":{"dur":3,"text":"which in science we actually\ncall this sixth sense."},"1065":{"dur":1,"text":"It's called interoception."},"1067":{"dur":3,"text":"We'll explore that and then we're\ngoing to actually move the spoke"},"1071":{"dur":3,"text":"around to the third segment of four in the rim."},"1075":{"dur":8,"text":"This third segment allows us to explore mental\nlife or feelings, thoughts, memories, hopes,"},"1084":{"dur":3,"text":"dreams, attitudes, intentions, longings."},"1088":{"dur":5,"text":"All of that mental life is represented\nhere on this third segment of the rim."},"1094":{"dur":7,"text":"And then as we go around, we'll do some other\nthings including exploring the fourth aspect"},"1101":{"dur":5,"text":"of the rim, which is our sense\nof relationships to people"},"1107":{"dur":3,"text":"and things including outside of\nthese bodies that we inhabit."},"1112":{"dur":6,"text":"So that's basically an overview of\nthe wheel with its knowing in the hub,"},"1119":{"dur":5,"text":"its spoke of attention, and\nits rim of the known."},"1126":{"dur":5,"text":"So let's begin now again, letting your\neyes stay open partially closed or closed,"},"1131":{"dur":2,"text":"it doesn't matter whatever\nfeels most comfortable for you."},"1134":{"dur":4,"text":"Let your back be straight, unfold\nyour legs if they're crossed, keep--"},"1139":{"dur":2,"text":"if you're on the floor, that's fine, you\ncan cross it but if you're in a seat,"},"1142":{"dur":2,"text":"it's helpful that both feet flat on the floor."},"1145":{"dur":4,"text":"This is an active practice, so we want to have\na sense of dignity, our chest could be like,"},"1150":{"dur":4,"text":":OK I'm getting ready to go here,\"\nand let's begin the practice."},"1154":{"dur":10,"text":"Let's find the breath and ride the wave of\nthe breath in and out, letting that deep sense"},"1165":{"dur":9,"text":"of clarity and calm place us in the hub\nof knowing of the wheel of awareness."},"1176":{"dur":5,"text":"And now let the breath go as your focus of\nattention, so we're letting the breath go"},"1182":{"dur":6,"text":"but imagine that you are centering yourself\nin the hub of knowing, in this wheel,"},"1189":{"dur":5,"text":"and imagine either visualizing it or just\nthe idea of it, that you're now going"},"1195":{"dur":4,"text":"to send this spoke out to\nthe first segment of the rim."},"1200":{"dur":7,"text":"And let's begin with the sense of hearing\nand allow sounds to feel awareness."},"1208":{"dur":20,"text":"[ Pause ]"},"1229":{"dur":5,"text":"And now moving the spoke over a little\nbit this time to the sense of sight"},"1236":{"dur":4,"text":"and let light feel awareness\ncoming through closed eyelids"},"1240":{"dur":7,"text":"or you can gently open your eyelids and let\nus all focus bring light into

them."},"9085":{"dur":8,"text":"So, you know, I had a three-hour dinner over a\nlot of pasta and wine when used to be glutton"},"9094":{"dur":3,"text":"to talk about this because I said,\nthat doesn't really make sense,"},"9097":{"dur":1,"text":"why would an amoeba have a mind."},"9099":{"dur":2,"text":"But at the end after all that wine and past,"},"9102":{"dur":3,"text":"he convinced me that

not going to conduct them."},"9237":{"dur":4,"text":"This 10 person self-organizing system gets\ntogether and so far now, I've done this many,"},"9242":{"dur":4,"text":"many times, 75% of the

linking by singing the same song."},"9267":{"dur":2,"text":"So the bottom line is there was no conductor."},"9270":{"dur":4,"text":"I just say to them sing a\nsong together and I take off."},"9275":{"dur":6,"text":"And the point of that is to allow a system to\nhave its natural self organization movement."},"9281":{"dur":2,"text":"So in terms of-- we did the blade of\ngrass
