mean\nthat the Iguazu Falls are an illusion."},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"It doesn't mean it's not real."},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"What it means is\nwe have to understand what it is"},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"as something which has a history,"},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"has certain things that keep it together,"},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"but it's a process, it's fluid,\nit's forever changing."},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"Now that, I think, is a model\nfor understanding ourselves,"},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"and I think it's a liberating model."},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"Because if you think that you have\nthis fixed, permanent essence,"},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"which is always the same,\nthroughout your life, no matter what,"},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"in a sense you're kind of trapped."},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"You're born with an essence,"},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"that's what you are until you die,"},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"if you believe in an afterlife,\nmaybe you continue."},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"But if you think of yourself\nas being, in a way,"},"605":{"dur":3,"text":"not a thing as such,\nbut a kind of a process,"},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"something that is changing,"},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"then I think that's quite liberating."},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"Because unlike the the waterfalls,"},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"we actually have the capacity to
