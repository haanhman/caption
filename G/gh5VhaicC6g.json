people\nhave no idea how to get one,"},"87":{"dur":2,"text":"and no one teaches us how to do so."},"89":{"dur":4,"text":"We need to teach people\nhow to have healthy

married."},"120":{"dur":2,"text":"It's call premarital education."},"123":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is a good idea:"},"124":{"dur":2,"text":"teach people how to have\na good

you want and need\nin a partner and a relationship,"},"165":{"dur":2,"text":"selecting the right person,"},"168":{"dur":3,"text":"and developing and using skills\nright from the

things\nthat lead to healthy relationships"},"197":{"dur":3,"text":"and reduce the behaviors\nthat lead to unhealthy ones."},"201":{"dur":2,"text":"We've identified three skills -"},"203":{"dur":3,"text":"insight, mutuality,\nand emotion regulation -"},"207":{"dur":4,"text":"that form the basis for what we call\nromantic competence."},"211":{"dur":4,"text":"Romantic competence\nis the ability to function adaptively"},"215":{"dur":4,"text":"across all areas or all aspects\nof the relationship process,"},"220":{"dur":2,"text":"from figuring out what you need,"},"223":{"dur":3,"text":"to finding the right person,\nto building a healthy relationship,"},"227":{"dur":4,"text":"and to getting out of relationships\nthat are unhealthy."},"231":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll tell you more\nabout the skills in a minute,"},"233":{"dur":3,"text":"but first, let me say that we didn't just\nmake this up out of the blue."},"236":{"dur":1,"text":"We identified the skills"},"238":{"dur":3,"text":"based on a thorough review\nof theory and research."},"242":{"dur":3,"text":"And the skills really\nrepresent the commonalities"},"245":{"dur":2,"text":"across the major theories\nand research findings"},"248":{"dur":1,"text":"on healthy relationships."},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"And because they represent\nthe commonalities,"},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"we think they really can help people"},"256":{"dur":3,"text":"with all the different parts\nof the relationship process,"},"259":{"dur":4,"text":"and with all different people -\nwhether people in a relationship or not."},"265":{"dur":1,"text":"So let me tell you about the skills."},"267":{"dur":2,"text":"The first one is insight."},"269":{"dur":5,"text":"Insight is about awareness,\nand understanding, and learning."},"275":{"dur":6,"text":"So with insight, you'll have a better idea\nof who you are, what you need,"},"281":{"dur":2,"text":"what you want,\nwhy you do the things you do."},"283":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's say you are being\nreally snappy to your partner."},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"With insight, you might notice or realize"},"290":{"dur":2,"text":"that it's not that your partner\nis doing anything,"},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"but actually you're really\nstressed out at work."},"294":{"dur":2,"text":"What you really need\nis to relax a little bit,"},"297":{"dur":2,"text":"so it doesn't bleed out\nover into your relationship."},"300":{"dur":3,"text":"Insight will also let you know\nyour partner better."},"303":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's say your partner\nshows up late for a date."},"306":{"dur":2,"text":"With insight, you'll know why."},"308":{"dur":2,"text":"For example, maybe your partner\nis late for everything."},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"It's nothing about you\nor the relationship."},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"That's just who your partner is."},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"With insight, you'll be able to anticipate"},"318":{"dur":3,"text":"the positive and negative\nconsequences of your behavior."},"323":{"dur":3,"text":"For example, you'll know\nthat if you send that nasty text,"},"326":{"dur":1,"text":"it is not going to go well."},"328":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe you'd better\nmake a phone call instead."},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"With insight, you will be able\nto learn from your mistakes"},"335":{"dur":3,"text":"in ways that allow you to behave\ndifferently in the future."},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"So maybe you'll recognize\nthat you're the kind of person"},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"who tends to jump in really quickly -"},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"you get wrapped up\nin the romance of things -"},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"and then things don't go well."},"348":{"dur":1,"text":"So you might be able to say,"},"349":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Well, you know what the next time"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm just going to take things\na little more slowly"},"354":{"dur":2,"text":"and not repeat the same mistake."},"357":{"dur":2,"text":"And with insight,\nyou'll have a better understanding"},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"about what's really right\nfor you in a relationship."},"363":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe you're the kind of person"},"365":{"dur":2,"text":"who really needs\na monogamous relationship."},"367":{"dur":3,"text":"You are not OK with your partner\nseeing other people."},"370":{"dur":2,"text":"Or maybe you'll realize\nit's just the opposite,"},"373":{"dur":1,"text":"that you're not ready to settle down,"},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"and you need a partner\nwho is OK with that."},"378":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's insight."},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"The second skill is mutuality."},"382":{"dur":3,"text":"Mutuality is about knowing\nthat both people have needs,"},"386":{"dur":3,"text":"and that both sets of needs matter."},"389":{"dur":1,"text":"With mutuality"},"390":{"dur":4,"text":"you'll be able to convey your own needs\nin a clear direct fashion"},"395":{"dur":3,"text":"that increases the likelihood\nthat you'll get them met."},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's say you have to go\nto a really stressful family event,"},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"and you'd like your partner\nto be there with you."},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"You might say directly:"},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"\"You know this is going\nto be stressful for me."},"407":{"dur":1,"text":"I'd really love for you to be there;"},"409":{"dur":1,"text":"you'll be a really good buffer for me."},"411":{"dur":3,"text":"Is there any way you can\nclear your schedule to come with me?\""},"415":{"dur":1,"text":"With mutuality,"},"417":{"dur":3,"text":"you'll be willing to meet\nyour partner's needs as well."},"421":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's say you know that your partner\nreally likes to go to the gym"},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"first thing in the morning,"},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"it makes your partner\nfeel better the rest of the day."},"428":{"dur":4,"text":"Mutuality will let you be willing\nto support your partner in this,"},"432":{"dur":3,"text":"even though you'd really rather have\nyour partner stay home, in bed with you."},"437":{"dur":4,"text":"And mutuality also lets you\nfactor both people's needs"},"442":{"dur":3,"text":"into decisions that you make\nabout your relationship."},"445":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's say you get a great job offer\nthat you'd like to take,"},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"but you know it means\nyou will to have to work more,"},"451":{"dur":1,"text":"and you know how important it is"},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"for both you and your partner\nto spend time together."},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"With a mutual approach, you might say,"},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"\"You know, I'd really like\nto take this job,"},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"it's really important to me,"},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"but I also am concerned\nabout us spending time together."},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"If I promise to protect some time for us,"},"468":{"dur":3,"text":"will you be OK with me taking this job?\""},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"That's a mutual approach to relationships."},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"The third skill is emotion regulation."},"477":{"dur":3,"text":"And emotion regulation\nis about regulating your feelings"},"481":{"dur":3,"text":"in response to things\nthat happen in your relationship."},"485":{"dur":4,"text":"With emotion regulation,\nyou'll be able to ..."},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"keep your emotions calm"},"492":{"dur":3,"text":"and keep things that happen\nin your relationship in perspective."},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"So, you might think: \"Oh, my goodness."},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"This is a disaster!\nThis is the worst thing ever!"},"501":{"dur":1,"text":"How am I going to handle this?\""},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"With emotion regulation, you'll think:"},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"\"You know what, I can handle this."},"508":{"dur":1,"text":"This is going to be all right."},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"There is a way to deal with this.\nI'm going to figure this out."},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"Everything is going to be OK.\""},"515":{"dur":1,"text":"With emotion regulation,"},"516":{"dur":3,"text":"you'll be able to tolerate\nuncomfortable feelings"},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"and not act out on them impulsively,"},"522":{"dur":3,"text":"so you'll to be able to think through\nyour decisions more clearly."},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"So let's say your waiting\nfor your partner to text you back."},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"That text isn't coming;\nyou're getting really anxious;"},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"you're checking your phone\nevery two seconds."},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"With emotion regulation,\nyou'll be able to tell yourself,"},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"\"You know what? Calm down."},"538":{"dur":1,"text":"The text is going to come."},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't need to check\nmy phone every second;"},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm just going to put it away\nand focus on the task at hand.\""},"547":{"dur":1,"text":"And with emotion regulation,"},"548":{"dur":3,"text":"you'll be able to maintain\na sense of self-respect"},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"and commitment to your needs,"},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"even when bad things happen\nin your relationship."},"556":{"dur":1,"text":"So let's say you have a breakup."},"558":{"dur":4,"text":"You're feeling really depressed;\nyou're really missing your partner."},"562":{"dur":1,"text":"With emotion regulation,"},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"you'll be able to let\nyourself know that it is OK;"},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"that, yeah, you're going\nto feel depressed,"},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"but you're going to get over it\nand get through this."},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"If you beg and plead to get back together,"},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"you're not going to feel good\nabout yourself,"},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"and you don't even want to be\nin a relationship"},"577":{"dur":1,"text":"that wasn't good for you."},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"So insight, mutuality,\nand emotion regulation."},"584":{"dur":5,"text":"I believe it's people's ability\nto use the skills on a day-to-day basis"},"589":{"dur":3,"text":"that lets them have healthy relationships."},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"So let me give you an example\nof how this works."},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"The other day I was talking\nto someone, and she said"},"598":{"dur":3,"text":"that when her partner asked her\nwhat she wanted for her birthday,"},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"she told him she didn't want anything."},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"So guess what? She didn't get anything."},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"And she got really angry,\nand they had a big fight."},"609":{"dur":1,"text":"Why?"},"610":{"dur":3,"text":"Because she really did want a present,\nshe just didn't want to tell him;"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"she just wanted him to somehow know."},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"It is called mind reading."},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"It is a terrible idea; it never works."},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"Had she been using the skills,"},"622":{"dur":3,"text":"insight would have let her\nknow herself well enough to realize"},"626":{"dur":1,"text":"that she really did want something,"},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"and if she didn't get it,\nshe was going to be mad."},"630":{"dur":4,"text":"Insight also would have let her know\nthat her partner was the kind of guy"},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"who was just going\nto take what she said literally."},"638":{"dur":4,"text":"Mutuality would have let her\nreally ask for what she wanted,"},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"directly and clearly."},"646":{"dur":4,"text":"And emotion regulation would have let her\ndeal with any feelings she was having"},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"that were getting\nin the way of doing that."},"653":{"dur":1,"text":"So maybe she was feeling kind of anxious:"},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"What would he think\nif I asked for what I needed?"},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"Or maybe she was feeling guilty, you know."},"660":{"dur":1,"text":"She knows they are saving for a big trip,"},"662":{"dur":4,"text":"and she maybe thought that he would think\nthat she was kind of greedy or something."},"667":{"dur":3,"text":"So if she had used the skills,\nshe would have been able to say,"},"670":{"dur":1,"text":"\"You know what?"},"671":{"dur":1,"text":"I know we are saving for that trip,"},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"but I really like that necklace\nthat we saw the other day,"},"676":{"dur":1,"text":"and it wasn't that expensive.\""},"678":{"dur":1,"text":"He would have gotten it for her."},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"She would have felt respected and valued."},"682":{"dur":1,"text":"He would have been happy."},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"They would have felt more intimate."},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"This whole birthday gift thing\nwould have gone well,"},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"instead of ending in a fight"},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"that could really\ndamage their relationship."},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, this was just an anecdote."},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"We have data to support this as well."},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"I've been studying romantic competence,"},"703":{"dur":4,"text":"the ability for people to use insight,\nmutuality, and emotion regulation,"},"707":{"dur":1,"text":"among young people."},"709":{"dur":1,"text":"In one of our studies,"},"710":{"dur":3,"text":"we looked at 13- and 14-year-old girls,\nearly adolescent girls,"},"714":{"dur":4,"text":"and we found that girls\nwho were more romantically competent"},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"felt more secure in their relationships."},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"They felt comfortable\nbeing close to people,"},"723":{"dur":3,"text":"they could trust people,\nthey weren't worried about being rejected."},"728":{"dur":3,"text":"Girls who are more romantically competent\nreported fewer depressive symptoms,"},"732":{"dur":1,"text":"they had better mental health."},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"They also were more positive"},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"about their expectations\nabout marriage in the future;"},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"they were more optimistic\nthat it could go well."},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"Girls with greater romantic competence"},"745":{"dur":4,"text":"were engaging in more typical\nromantic activities for their age,"},"750":{"dur":4,"text":"things that were normative,\nlike dating and flirting"},"754":{"dur":3,"text":"and affectionate behaviors\nlike hugging and kissing."},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"And girls who were more\nromantically competent"},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"were engaging in fewer ..."},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"atypical, sexual activities,\nlike sexual intercourse,"},"768":{"dur":4,"text":"which can be considered pretty risky\nfor a 13- and 14-year-old girl."},"773":{"dur":3,"text":"So, even at an early age,\n13 and 14 years old,"},"776":{"dur":3,"text":"when these girls mostly\nwere not even in relationships,"},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"the more romantically competent they were,"},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"the more adaptive relational\nfunctioning they were showing,"},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"and the better mental health\nthey were showing."},"789":{"dur":5,"text":"We see the same things\namong young adults, 18 to 25 years old:"},"795":{"dur":5,"text":"More romantically competent men and women\nfeel more secure in relationships."},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"They also report making better decisions,"},"803":{"dur":2,"text":"they can see the warning signs\nwhen things aren't going well"},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"and make conscious decisions\nwith confidence."},"810":{"dur":4,"text":"They're also better at seeking\nand providing support to their partners."},"814":{"dur":2,"text":"So, they are more willing\nto ask for what they need"},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"and use what their partners give them."},"820":{"dur":3,"text":"And they are better at providing\nhelpful support when needed."},"823":{"dur":1,"text":"And this isn't just what they told us,"},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"we actually observed them\ndoing this in our laboratory,"},"828":{"dur":4,"text":"where we asked them to talk\nwith one another about a personal problem."},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"Young people who were\nmore romantically competent"},"837":{"dur":2,"text":"also were more satisfied\nin their relationships,"},"840":{"dur":1,"text":"they were happier."},"842":{"dur":2,"text":"And again, they reported\nfewer depressive symptoms"},"845":{"dur":2,"text":"and also fewer anxiety symptoms."},"848":{"dur":1,"text":"So overall,"},"850":{"dur":2,"text":"being romantically competent\nat a young age"},"853":{"dur":4,"text":"is associated with greater,\nmore adaptive relationship functioning"},"858":{"dur":2,"text":"and greater individual well being."},"861":{"dur":2,"text":"And this brings me back to my point"},"863":{"dur":4,"text":"that we need to be teaching people\nhow to have healthy relationships."},"868":{"dur":1,"text":"So, like I said earlier on,"},"871":{"dur":2,"text":"we may know what a healthy\nrelationship looks like,"},"874":{"dur":2,"text":"but most people have no idea\nhow to get one,"},"876":{"dur":2,"text":"and no one teaches us how to do so."},"879":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is a problem."},"881":{"dur":5,"text":"We need to help people genuinely know\nwhat they want and need in a relationship."},"887":{"dur":2,"text":"We need to help them\nselect the right partner."},"890":{"dur":2,"text":"We need to help them make good decisions"},"892":{"dur":3,"text":"and deal with the challenges\nthat relationships bring."},"896":{"dur":3,"text":"And we need to help them\nbuild and use skills"},"900":{"dur":2,"text":"right from the beginning."},"902":{"dur":3,"text":"This is what the notion\nof romantic competence is all about."},"906":{"dur":4,"text":"It's all about using insight, mutuality,\nand emotion

criticism,\nand contempt, and violence."},"921":{"dur":3,"text":"And create the things\nthat lead to healthy relationships,"},"925":{"dur":4,"text":"like intimacy, security, respect,\ngood communication,"},"930":{"dur":2,"text":"and a sense of being valued."},"933":{"dur":3,"text":"And wouldn't all of our relationships\nbenefit from this?"},"936":{"dur":1,"text":"I think they would."},"937":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you."},"939":{"dur":2,"text":"(Applause)"}}
