leave\nit at that, right?"},"120":{"dur":3,"text":"I thought I'd begin with a\nvideo that kind of explains what"},"123":{"dur":1,"text":"I do when I'm in the field."},"125":{"dur":2,"text":"So the

during the spring\nwhen the snow melts,"},"186":{"dur":2,"text":"the miners collect all the water\nin these big holding ponds,"},"189":{"dur":2,"text":"and then they pump it up\nto wherever they're

a\nbiologist, and you"},"270":{"dur":4,"text":"want to avoid some of these\nparticularly dire predictions"},"274":{"dur":2,"text":"here, you might\nwant to understand,"},"276":{"dur":3,"text":"or be able to predict in some\nuseful way, how the species"},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"and communities that\nwe're trying to protect we"},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"are going to respond for the\nchange in the

really\njust a plot of how"},"309":{"dur":3,"text":"that temperature has changed\nover the last 1,000 years."},"312":{"dur":2,"text":"So you see the temperature\nremained pretty constant,"},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"maybe declining a little bit\nthrough time, until a couple"},"317":{"dur":3,"text":"hundred years ago, when\nit shot up pretty quickly."},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"Now this plot can be\nextended into the future,"},"323":{"dur":1,"text":"and we see all\nsorts of predictions"},"324":{"dur":3,"text":"of climate increasing,\nthe temperature increasing"},"327":{"dur":3,"text":"exponentially throughout the\nnext 50 years to 100 years."},"331":{"dur":3,"text":"Of course, this is not the first\ntime in Earth's recent history"},"335":{"dur":3,"text":"that the planet has experienced\na really rapid increase"},"338":{"dur":0,"text":"in temperature."},"339":{"dur":3,"text":"If we extend this plot backward\nto the last 50,000 years,"},"342":{"dur":3,"text":"we see an interval right here,\nin between around 18,000 years"},"346":{"dur":3,"text":"ago and maybe 12,000\nor 13,000 years ago,"},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"when the average global\ntemperature increased"},"351":{"dur":1,"text":"by about eight degrees."},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"This here is only about\n1 and 1\/2 degrees."},"355":{"dur":1,"text":"This is an\neight-degree increase."},"356":{"dur":1,"text":"Some of the work that\nwe're doing right now"},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"is suggesting that\nthis last period"},"361":{"dur":3,"text":"of really rapid increase-- this\nis the transition from the peak"},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"of the last Ice Age into\nthe Holocene warm interval"},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"that we're experiencing\ntoday-- this last period"},"370":{"dur":2,"text":"possibly happened over\nless than 100 years,"},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"or even as quickly\nas a few decades."},"374":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is a very rapid period\nof widespread global warming"},"379":{"dur":3,"text":"that's going to be associated\nwith all sorts of changes"},"382":{"dur":1,"text":"in temperature\nand precipitation,"},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"and changes to the\nbiological species that"},"386":{"dur":1,"text":"are living out there."},"388":{"dur":3,"text":"So what I try to do with my\nresearch is ask the question,"},"391":{"dur":4,"text":"how did species and communities\nand populations and ecosystems"},"395":{"dur":4,"text":"change in response to this past\nperiod of rapid climate change?"},"400":{"dur":1,"text":"And is there\nanything that we can"},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"use from learning about\nwhat happened in the past"},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"to make better decisions about\nhow to spend the limited time"},"408":{"dur":4,"text":"and energy and resources we\nhave to conserve species today?"},"412":{"dur":1,"text":"So the field I work in\nis called ancient DNA."},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"It's pretty clear what\nancient DNA means."},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"It means old DNA, not old\npeople DNA, but actually"},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"really old DNA, like\nmammoths preserved in ice."},"422":{"dur":1,"text":"I work at a place\ncalled Beringia."},"423":{"dur":2,"text":"Beringia spans\nthis part of Alaska"},"426":{"dur":3,"text":"here, across the Bering land\nbridge into eastern Siberia."},"430":{"dur":4,"text":"All of this white stuff here\nis just an indication that it's"},"434":{"dur":1,"text":"not as deep in the ocean there."},"435":{"dur":4,"text":"So during the Ice Ages, when\nmuch of the water on the planet"},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"was taken up into making\ngiant glaciers sitting"},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"on top of the continents,\nthis was actually exposed."},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"This was exposed land."},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"And this, of course, is\na very important corridor"},"449":{"dur":3,"text":"for movement of many species,\ncamels and

Beringia\nlooks like this."},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm actually in that\nhelicopter, taking this picture."},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'll show you a picture\nof that fantastic flying"},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"machine in just a moment."},"466":{"dur":0,"text":"Looks like this."},"467":{"dur":1,"text":"But in the past, and\nduring the last Ice Age,"},"469":{"dur":4,"text":"it looked more like this, with\na very rich and diverse plant"},"473":{"dur":3,"text":"community that was grazed on\nby a rich and diverse herbivore"},"477":{"dur":1,"text":"community that\nwas hunted by lots"},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"of different types\nof carnivores."},"481":{"dur":3,"text":"There were mammoths and\nmastodons at various times,"},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"and North American

animal."},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"So we fly out here in this\nfantastic flying machine."},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"You'll notice that there\nare some windows missing,"},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"which is great, in\ncase anybody wants"},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"to smoke on board in\ncelebration of taking off."},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm not saying that happened,\nbut I'm not saying it

that we\nwere dealing with up there"},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"in the Arctic."},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"And we walk along\nall sorts of places,"},"531":{"dur":1,"text":"wherever the\npermafrost is

away."},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"So in a day out in\nthe field, we'll"},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"generally collect anywhere\nbetween five and 20 bags"},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"of bones like this."},"558":{"dur":1,"text":"Most of the bones\nthere are bison."},"560":{"dur":4,"text":"There are also mammoth\nand caribou and horses."},"564":{"dur":3,"text":"And sometimes we get lucky and\nget wolves or bears or lions."},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"And we take a piece out of these\nbones, a tiny piece-- that's"},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"just a regular Dremel tool\nwith a little cutting disk--"},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"and bring that piece\nback to the lab,"},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"grind it up, and extract DNA."},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"And then we correlate the\namount of genetic diversity"},"581":{"dur":3,"text":"that we observe in any\nspecies at one point in time"},"584":{"dur":1,"text":"with the size of the population."},"586":{"dur":3,"text":"So in essence, we can use\nDNA extracted from thousands"},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"of these bones to learn\nhow populations were"},"591":{"dur":3,"text":"growing or shrinking or\nmoving across the landscape,"},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"or whether there were\nlocal extinctions followed"},"597":{"dur":3,"text":"by replacements of populations\ncoming in from somewhere else."},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"And we've learned an\nawful lot of stuff"},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"over the last couple\ndecades of doing this."},"605":{"dur":3,"text":"For example, we've learned that\nbison, horses, and mammoths all"},"608":{"dur":3,"text":"peaked in population size\naround 40,000 years ago,"},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"and then started to climb."},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is\ninteresting, because two"},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"of the main hypotheses about\nwhat caused the megafauna mass"},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"extinction at the end\nof the Pleistocene,"},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"when we did lose\nmammoths and many other"},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"of these big species,\nwere that they didn't"},"626":{"dur":1,"text":"like the peak of\nthe last Ice Age--"},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"it was too cold and\ntoo terrible for them--"},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"or that people turned up\nand hunted them to death."},"632":{"dur":3,"text":"But if the initial decline\nbegins about 30,000 years ago,"},"636":{"dur":3,"text":"that's 10,000 years before\nthe peak of the last Ice Age,"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"and 15,000 years before any\nevidence of large numbers"},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"of humans in North America."},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"So it looks like we're off\nthe hook for the beginning"},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"of these extinctions, although\nI'm not quite willing to let us"},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"off the hook for the\nultimate extinction"},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"event of many of these species."},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"We've watched carnivore\npopulations grow and move"},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"in response to changes in the\ndynamics of the herbivores"},"659":{"dur":3,"text":"And we're starting to learn\nwhy some species, like caribou,"},"662":{"dur":0,"text":"survived."},"663":{"dur":1,"text":"They liked to live\nwhere humans didn't,"},"665":{"dur":1,"text":"which is a pretty good trick."},"667":{"dur":3,"text":"And other species, like\ncave lions, went extinct."},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"And I and colleagues who\nwork on this stuff often"},"673":{"dur":3,"text":"get to publish these papers in\npretty high profile journals."},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"They get lots of press\nattention, and people care."},"678":{"dur":1,"text":"People are really interested."},"679":{"dur":0,"text":"They call."},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm often really excited to\ntalk about what we've learned,"},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"and how it applies to\npresent day problems"},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"in biodiversity conservation."},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"But they only ever really\nask me one question."},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's kind of annoying."},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"And since there really is\nno sound bite-size response"},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"to this, I decided to\nwrite this book, right?"},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"So the field, the\nfield of bringing"},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"extinct species or

is,"},"782":{"dur":1,"text":"and they can't do anything else."},"784":{"dur":2,"text":"So the idea of somatic\ncell nuclear transfer"},"787":{"dur":3,"text":"is to trick a somatic cell

actually,"},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"then, become every\ntype of cell in a body"},"798":{"dur":2,"text":"and create a whole being."},"801":{"dur":1,"text":"So the most famous,\nand the first,"},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"example of somatic\ncell nuclear transfer"},"804":{"dur":1,"text":"was an experiment in\nthe mid-1990s that"},"806":{"dur":1,"text":"brought us Dolly the

them."},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"They starved them of\nnutrients in a dish in a lab."},"824":{"dur":1,"text":"At the same time,\nthey took an egg cell"},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"from a different breed\nof

in\nthe field and we"},"874":{"dur":2,"text":"find one of these fantastically\npreserved mammoths."},"876":{"dur":2,"text":"And we remove some cells,\nand then we stress them out,"},"878":{"dur":1,"text":"and then we stick those cells\nin the nucleus of an egg."},"880":{"dur":1,"text":"And it does that\nlittle magic thing,"},"882":{"dur":1,"text":"and then we stick
