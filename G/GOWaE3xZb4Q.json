really focus on\nthe things that matter to me, what doesn't"},"559":{"dur":1,"text":"matter to me anymore."},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"And that\u2019s a hard transition because for\nme, we\u2019ve been

and their\nstories and their struggles and their business"},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"life and their work life."},"575":{"dur":4,"text":"And for me, that\u2019s where the fascinating\nstory is, but that\u2019s not the case with all"},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"of our readers who would love to just see\nmore shopping."},"582":{"dur":3,"text":"And so that transition has been a scary
