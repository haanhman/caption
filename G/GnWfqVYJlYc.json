really by stating something"},"307":{"dur":3,"text":"pretty obvious: bacteria are extremely small."},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was looking around for something to scale"},"313":{"dur":3,"text":"them against and I found that the \u00a32 coin was very"},"317":{"dur":3,"text":"suitable and then I realised that the 1997 version"},"320":{"dur":1,"text":"of this is actually very special."},"321":{"dur":1,"text":"It's dedicated, for those of you who didn't"},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"realise this (and I didn't); it's special because"},"326":{"dur":4,"text":"it's dedicated to scientific discovery."},"330":{"dur":4,"text":"And on the edge of this is this little quote from"},"335":{"dur":1,"text":"Isaac Newton, which is very special to many of

wider than a typical human cell which"},"353":{"dur":1,"text":"you see here."},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"So that means that you could fit the best part of"},"358":{"dur":3,"text":"a million human cells on the surface of a \u00a32 coin"},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"so human cells are very small but then if you"},"364":{"dur":3,"text":"actually look at a bacterial cell in the same slide,"},"368":{"dur":1,"text":"you'll see that bacteria are even smaller."},"370":{"dur":2,"text":"Much smaller than human cells and you could"},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"probably fit several thousands

very little in terms of bacterial"},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"structure from light microscopy."},"387":{"dur":1,"text":"You need to go to things like electron microscopy,"},"388":{"dur":3,"text":"which I\u2019ll mention later, to really blow these\ncells up."},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"What I thought I\u2019d mention again, just to illustrate"},"394":{"dur":1,"text":"the problem that we're up against, looking at"},"396":{"dur":4,"text":"bacterial cells is that if you were to place or"},"401":{"dur":4,"text":"point green light within this cell like this pointer,"},"405":{"dur":4,"text":"actually, because we're actually very close to the"},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"wavelength of light, so this is the wavelength of"},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"green light on a similar kind of

light."},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"So that means that the resolution of bacterial"},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"structure by light microscopy is very challenging."},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"As I\u2019ll hopefully convince you, we're learning a lot"},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"about the ultra structure of bacterial cells now"},"430":{"dur":4,"text":"through this bacterial cell biology field."},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"So we have to begin with Antonie van Leeuwenhoek."},"436":{"dur":2,"text":"As John mentioned, he's really the father of\nmicrobiology."},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"He was the first person to see, to realise that there"},"441":{"dur":4,"text":"were microscopic animals, if you like, or organisms"},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"and this is one of his microscopes, this tiny"},"448":{"dur":1,"text":"microscope and we'll contrast it with some of the"},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"microscopes that we use now soon."},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"These are some illustrations that he put into some"},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"of the letters that he sent to the Royal Society"},"457":{"dur":1,"text":"and the microbiologists out there will recognise the"},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"major morphological classes of bacteria -"},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"there are basically two or maybe three morphologically"},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"distinct classes."},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"There are rod shaped things like this."},"467":{"dur":3,"text":"There are spherical things like these tiny things"},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"that we would call cocci."},"471":{"dur":1,"text":"There are helical things and one of the other"},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"things that he noticed, which was amazing, is that"},"475":{"dur":1,"text":"he noticed that bacteria could actually swim."},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"So this cell is actually moving and in fact, they can"},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"swim in a directed manner and I\u2019ll show you a"},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"little bit later one of the proteins that's involved"},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"in actually detecting chemical gradients which cells"},"488":{"dur":3,"text":"use to direct their swimming."},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"So actually, remarkably little happened if you look"},"495":{"dur":3,"text":"at the history of microbiology, over the\nnext 200 years."},"498":{"dur":3,"text":"And it was really not until the end of the 19th Century"},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"that microbiologists really connected infectious"},"504":{"dur":3,"text":"disease to particular kinds of bacteria."},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"One of the heroes of this period was"},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"Hans Christian Gram, and towards the end of the"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"19th Century, he invented this staining method"},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"called the Gram stain which is actually such a"},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"fantastic stain that it's still used to this day by"},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"clinical microbiologists."},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"And so it distinguishes between gram positive"},"526":{"dur":3,"text":"bacteria which are blue or purple, and gram negative"},"529":{"dur":3,"text":"bacteria which through the stain actually appear pink."},"533":{"dur":1,"text":"This is important because it turns out,"},"535":{"dur":1,"text":"and Gram couldn\u2019t possibly have known this,"},"537":{"dur":3,"text":"that the difference in Gram staining is actually to do"},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"with the structure of the cell surface which is"},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"different in Gram positive bacteria from Gram negative\nbacteria."},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"And these organisms: the Gram positives and\nGram negatives"},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"probably diverged from each other something like"},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"one billion years ago."},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's a very important distinction which Gram"},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"discovered and which is still used."},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"And so again, we can see two different kinds\nof bacteria."},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"We can see their shapes but really, that was all"},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"we had to go on in terms of microbial structure for"},"567":{"dur":3,"text":"many, many decades."},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, in the middle of the last Century, the problem"},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"of resolution was really solved by the advent\nof electron microscopy."},"576":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is a modern, typical electron microscope"},"579":{"dur":3,"text":"from Newcastle and basically there's an electron\ngun here."},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"There is a specimen chamber here."},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"The electrons are fired at the specimen and then"},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"an image is collected at the bottom of the machine here"},"589":{"dur":3,"text":"and it can be displayed nowadays on a computer display."},"593":{"dur":4,"text":"And this solved the resolution problem but it's at\na cost."},"598":{"dur":3,"text":"The cost comes from the fact that electrons are very"},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"easily scattered, even by water molecules."},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"So to get good images of biological specimens by"},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"electron microscopy, you have to dehydrate them."},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"You have to take the water out and you have to do"},"613":{"dur":0,"text":"other stuff, a lot of things."},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"For example, you have to fix the cells with horrible"},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"chemicals that make lots of chemical crosslinks to stop"},"619":{"dur":1,"text":"them being destroyed when you dehydrate them"},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"and then afterwards, you have to embed them in plastic."},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"Then you have to section them with a diamond knife"},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"to get sections which are thin enough to be able to be"},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"visualised by electron microscopy."},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"Then finally, these specimens are actually relatively"},"635":{"dur":2,"text":"transparent and so you need to stain them and"},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"typically you stain them with something like uranium,"},"640":{"dur":3,"text":"very heavy, heavy metal atoms to actually be able"},"643":{"dur":5,"text":"to resolve these, to see anything in these specimens."},"649":{"dur":3,"text":"So when you do all of this, there is lots of potential"},"653":{"dur":1,"text":"for artefacts here."},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"What you can see are really basically four distinct\nstructures."},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"There's a sort of fluffy white stuff in the middle which"},"660":{"dur":1,"text":"is where the DNA is."},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"There is a granular material called the cytoplasm which"},"664":{"dur":4,"text":"is mainly ribosomes and they're probably in synthetic\napparatus."},"669":{"dur":1,"text":"Then there's this very prominent cell wall structure"},"671":{"dur":3,"text":"on the outside and just inside that is a cell membrane"},"674":{"dur":1,"text":"which isn't really very visible here."},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"This is a semi-permeable membrane which separates"},"678":{"dur":3,"text":"the inside of the cell from the outside."},"682":{"dur":3,"text":"So this gave the impression of a rather featureless"},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"kind of cell structure and that stayed with"},"689":{"dur":3,"text":"microbiologists or biologists really for\nseveral decades."},"693":{"dur":1,"text":"It gave an impression of simplicity and lack of"},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"compartmentalisation, or regional specialisation which"},"697":{"dur":4,"text":"I think has really held the field back until recently."},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"So all of this changed in the 1990s, and Roger Tsien"},"705":{"dur":1,"text":"was one of the heroes of this."},"706":{"dur":3,"text":"He won the Nobel Prize with his colleagues for"},"710":{"dur":3,"text":"realising the potential of taking a protein"},"713":{"dur":6,"text":"perversely from a jellyfish, this kind of jellyfish\nhere, Aequoria"},"720":{"dur":2,"text":"and these are wonderful creatures."},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"If you go to the Tropics and you look in the sea at"},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"night, you can see these jellyfish glowing so they"},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"generate their own light and one of the proteins that"},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"they use to generate light is this protein called"},"733":{"dur":1,"text":"Green Fluorescent Protein."},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"And what Tsien and his colleagues did was to harness"},"737":{"dur":4,"text":"this as a tool for actually imaging all sorts of things"},"742":{"dur":1,"text":"in biological systems."},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"So in bacteria, what we do is we take a gene which is"},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"interesting to us, which might be involved in cell wall"},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"synthesis or cell division and we use genetic"},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"engineering methods to take the gene which came"},"755":{"dur":2,"text":"originally from the jellyfish and actually fuse it to"},"758":{"dur":1,"text":"our gene of interest."},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"What then happens is that this generates a hybrid"},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"protein which hopefully is functional, which is produced,"},"766":{"dur":1,"text":"the same as the protein which is made by our"},"768":{"dur":2,"text":"gene of interest, except that it has this green tag on it"},"770":{"dur":3,"text":"and this gives us that pinpoint of green light which I"},"774":{"dur":4,"text":"mentioned in the earlier slide, which enables us to"},"778":{"dur":5,"text":"follow using modern fluorescent microscopes, where this"},"784":{"dur":2,"text":"protein goes inside the cell."},"786":{"dur":1,"text":"And so we can do this to all of the proteins in bacterial"},"788":{"dur":3,"text":"cells and we can ask, 'Where do they go in the cell?'"},"792":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is in contrast to van Leeuwenhoek 's early\nmicroscope."},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"This is one of the microscopes that we have\nnow in the CBCB."},"799":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a commercial microscope and what's amazing about"},"803":{"dur":3,"text":"the way this technology is developing now is that"},"806":{"dur":3,"text":"these microscopes are starting to overcome some"},"810":{"dur":2,"text":"of the limitations of light microscopy due to the"},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"wavelength of light."},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"So this gives us something  like a twofold improvement"},"817":{"dur":3,"text":"in resolution over the best fluorescence microscopes"},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"that used to be available."},"823":{"dur":2,"text":"And you see the complexity of the system."},"826":{"dur":1,"text":"Here is the microscope but then there are all these"},"828":{"dur":2,"text":"other add-ons: lasers and cameras, and then the whole"},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"thing gets connected to a computer which collects"},"833":{"dur":4,"text":"the digital images where the images are processed."},"838":{"dur":2,"text":"So I thought in the next few slides I would show you"},"840":{"dur":1,"text":"some examples of what we've been able to do,"},"842":{"dur":2,"text":"well, we and many other labs have been able to do"},"844":{"dur":3,"text":"in terms of understanding bacterial ultra structure,"},"848":{"dur":2,"text":"and so these are some people from my lab who went"},"850":{"dur":4,"text":"to their favourite proteins and got me some images\nto look at."},"855":{"dur":1,"text":"So we may need to put the lights down a little bit,"},"856":{"dur":2,"text":"just for the next few slides."},"858":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is a very simple experiment."},"860":{"dur":2,"text":"Here, we have taken this green fluorescent protein"},"862":{"dur":3,"text":"and we've hooked it up to a protein sequence that"},"866":{"dur":2,"text":"takes it to the membrane, and so this basically stains"},"868":{"dur":1,"text":"the membrane of the cell."},"870":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can see this beautiful green outline"},"872":{"dur":2,"text":"of these B. Subtilis cells and you'll also see that in"},"875":{"dur":3,"text":"some of them, they are actually initiating a division,"},"879":{"dur":1,"text":"the cell division event which will eventually lead"},"881":{"dur":1,"text":"to the formation of two cells."},"883":{"dur":2,"text":"This one has just about completed division so there are"},"885":{"dur":3,"text":"now two cells and you see other cells are in different"},"889":{"dur":1,"text":"stages of division."},"891":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is all very simple."},"894":{"dur":2,"text":"What we've done in the next few slides is to replace"},"897":{"dur":4,"text":"that membrane stain with an actual red dye, which"},"901":{"dur":2,"text":"stains the membrane so we can see the outline of"},"904":{"dur":2,"text":"the cell which is as much as you saw in the previous\nslide."},"906":{"dur":3,"text":"But then we've connected the green fluorescent protein"},"910":{"dur":3,"text":"up to a series of different cellular proteins."},"914":{"dur":2,"text":"So in this example, we've connected it to a protein"},"916":{"dur":3,"text":"called Hbsu, which is what you might call a chromosome"},"919":{"dur":1,"text":"organising protein."},"921":{"dur":2,"text":"So this protein basically binds to the chromosome in"},"923":{"dur":5,"text":"the cell, the DNA material and it localises all over"},"928":{"dur":2,"text":"the chromosome and so what you see is the outline of"},"931":{"dur":2,"text":"the chromosome in these cells."},"934":{"dur":2,"text":"What's interesting about these images is that you see"},"936":{"dur":3,"text":"these very often bilobed structures, so there are two"},"940":{"dur":2,"text":"blobs or green that are connected together in each"},"942":{"dur":1,"text":"of these cells."},"944":{"dur":2,"text":"And we think these are chromosomes in the process of"},"946":{"dur":1,"text":"being replicated."},"948":{"dur":5,"text":"Ultimately, these two blobs of green will resolve and then"},"953":{"dur":1,"text":"the cell will divide in the middle to produce the two"},"955":{"dur":5,"text":"daughter cells, each of which has an intact copy of\nthe chromosome."},"960":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is another DNA binding protein."},"963":{"dur":2,"text":"This one is much more specific."},"966":{"dur":3,"text":"It localises in one very precise place on the chromosome,"},"970":{"dur":3,"text":"which is called oriC, and this is the place where the"},"973":{"dur":3,"text":"replication of the bacterial chromosome initiates."},"976":{"dur":2,"text":"And it always initiates at the same single site in"},"979":{"dur":1,"text":"bacterial chromosomes."},"980":{"dur":3,"text":"So these green spots that you see here actually"},"983":{"dur":6,"text":"correspond to initiation sites on the chromosome."},"990":{"dur":4,"text":"If you count these spots inside the cells, you can see"},"994":{"dur":3,"text":"that this cell has four spots; this cell has four spots"},"998":{"dur":1,"text":"and this one has eight spots."},"999":{"dur":1,"text":"And what this tells you, this kind of experiment tells"},"1001":{"dur":4,"text":"you is that bacteria are actually amazingly able to"},"1006":{"dur":2,"text":"reinitiate a round of DNA replication before the previous"},"1009":{"dur":1,"text":"round is even finished."},"1010":{"dur":4,"text":"So they can kind of get ahead of the game and one origin"},"1015":{"dur":3,"text":"will turn into two origins and then each of those two"},"1018":{"dur":3,"text":"origins will turn into another two origins, giving you a"},"1021":{"dur":1,"text":"total of four."},"1023":{"dur":2,"text":"And the cell is able to kind of organise its chromosome"},"1026":{"dur":3,"text":"with these multiple ongoing rounds of replication"},"1029":{"dur":2,"text":"and somehow manage to stop everything from getting"},"1031":{"dur":3,"text":"completely tangled so that when the cell eventually"},"1034":{"dur":7,"text":"divides, each of these cells will obtain a chromosome\ncomplement."},"1041":{"dur":1,"text":"So here is another kind of protein."},"1043":{"dur":2,"text":"This brings us back to that point I mentioned very early"},"1045":{"dur":2,"text":"and the beginning about the bacteria being able to"},"1048":{"dur":1,"text":"direct their swimming."},"1050":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is a protein called a chemoreceptor."},"1053":{"dur":2,"text":"This is effectively the bacterial nose."},"1055":{"dur":1,"text":"SO this is a protein that can actually detect chemical"},"1057":{"dur":3,"text":"gradients and what you see with this protein tagged"},"1060":{"dur":4,"text":"to GFP is that the protein is directed to the cell\npoles."},"1065":{"dur":2,"text":"And you get these little spots of localisation,"},"1067":{"dur":4,"text":"two spots of localisation often at each of the cell\npoles."},"1071":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is where the bacterial 'nose' is."},"1073":{"dur":4,"text":"These proteins help the organism to figure out,"},"1078":{"dur":2,"text":"to recognise chemical gradients and to respond to them"},"1081":{"dur":4,"text":"so that they can swim in an appropriate direction."},"1085":{"dur":3,"text":"So now we're getting to some proteins that will feature"},"1088":{"dur":1,"text":"later in the talk."},"1090":{"dur":3,"text":"This is one of my favourite proteins called FtsZ."},"1094":{"dur":3,"text":"This is basically the master regulator of cell division"},"1097":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's present in virtually all bacteria."},"1099":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is the protein that organises the division"},"1102":{"dur":4,"text":"machine and
