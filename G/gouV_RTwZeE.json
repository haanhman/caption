misconceptions"},"21":{"dur":4,"text":"around paper P5 mainly misconceptions\nthat students have"},"26":{"dur":3,"text":"about the paper and we sort of want to try\nand debunk the myths"},"29":{"dur":4,"text":"around advance performance management\nsecondly"},"33":{"dur":3,"text":"we want to talk about what p5 is\nactually about because there seems to be"},"37":{"dur":1,"text":"some confusion"},"38":{"dur":4,"text":"about where p5 is targeted how it links\nin with other papers"},"43":{"dur":4,"text":"and just how comparable or distinct\nstudents perceive it to be"},"48":{"dur":3,"text":"particularly from paper three. thirdly"},"51":{"dur":4,"text":"we want to then look at what under pinning knowledge you actually require"},"55":{"dur":1,"text":"for paper p5"},"56":{"dur":4,"text":"and particularly from the lower level\nmanagement accounting papers"},"61":{"dur":3,"text":"F2 and F5"},"64":{"dur":4,"text":"I would like to talk to you about how\nyou approach studying paper 5"},"68":{"dur":3,"text":"and also how you then think about\nrevising for it in the build-up to the"},"72":{"dur":0,"text":"exam"},"73":{"dur":3,"text":"because that seems to be something that\nstudents"},"76":{"dur":4,"text":"always require particular advice on and\noften request it"},"80":{"dur":4,"text":"both from tuition providers and\nobviously from anybody that they can get"},"84":{"dur":0,"text":"advice from"},"85":{"dur":4,"text":"other students, the professional body\netc. We would then"},"90":{"dur":3,"text":"like to talk about what resources you\nshould use particularly those on the ACCA"},"94":{"dur":2,"text":"website that have been produced for\nyou"},"96":{"dur":4,"text":"for your use and actually are probably\nunderutilized by students but are a good"},"100":{"dur":0,"text":"source of"},"101":{"dur":4,"text":"information and also as well any other\nuseful tips I can provide"},"106":{"dur":4,"text":"for you I'd like to sort of finish then by\nlooking at some of the examiner comments"},"110":{"dur":4,"text":"from previous P5 papers which\nactually should then tie into some of"},"115":{"dur":3,"text":"the earlier slides that i've talked about\nso you can see my reasoning"},"119":{"dur":4,"text":"behind providing you with this advice\nand then finally to finish"},"123":{"dur":3,"text":"what I am actually going to do is look at the\nsection A question from June"},"127":{"dur":3,"text":"2014 exam so the most recent paper\nthat's been sat"},"131":{"dur":3,"text":"and actually go through how I would have\napproached that question"},"134":{"dur":3,"text":"so in turn looking at breaking down the\nrequirements"},"137":{"dur":3,"text":"looking at what the scenario is telling\nme and then thinking about how I should"},"141":{"dur":1,"text":"structure my answer"},"142":{"dur":5,"text":"alright so the common misconceptions"},"147":{"dur":5,"text":"that students have about paper 5 well I\nsee a lot of students that say P5 is"},"153":{"dur":1,"text":"all about just learning theory"},"155":{"dur":3,"text":"well there are a lot of theories in paper 5"},"158":{"dur":3,"text":"some of which you have seen in earlier papers some of which are new specifically to"},"162":{"dur":4,"text":"and yes it is important to learn them but\nremember P5"},"167":{"dur":3,"text":"is at the final level of your ACCA\nstudies"},"170":{"dur":4,"text":"its targeted to be at Masters level so\ntherefore"},"174":{"dur":4,"text":"what you're expecting to see is a lot\nmore analysis and application in your"},"179":{"dur":1,"text":"approach to this paper"},"180":{"dur":4,"text":"what we don't want is students just\nregurgitating lots of knowledge"},"184":{"dur":4,"text":"because actually in the exam only twenty\nto thirty percent of the paper is"},"189":{"dur":4,"text":"actually for knowledge of theory so\npurely just learning theory"},"193":{"dur":4,"text":"is not going to pass you the exam what\nyou need to do is yes learn them"},"198":{"dur":1,"text":"the knowledge is important"},"199":{"dur":3,"text":"but it's about how you then apply them\nto the context that the examiner is"},"203":{"dur":0,"text":"giving you"},"204":{"dur":4,"text":"in the questions another common\nmisconception"},"208":{"dur":3,"text":"is that students think all you need to do\nto pass"},"212":{"dur":3,"text":"is to read the study text, yes again"},"215":{"dur":4,"text":"reading the syllabus on the study text\nis important because that is how you"},"219":{"dur":1,"text":"gain the knowledge"},"220":{"dur":3,"text":"but you won't learn the application and the\nanalysis skills"},"223":{"dur":4,"text":"without actually practicing questions\nand that means going and looking at past"},"228":{"dur":1,"text":"exam questions"},"229":{"dur":5,"text":"and thinking about what sought of approach\nthe examiner is taking there"},"234":{"dur":4,"text":"how was the exam in the syllabus how are\nyou answering that question are you"},"239":{"dur":1,"text":"answering it in the right way"},"240":{"dur":4,"text":"how is your time management and\nactually by practicing questions you"},"245":{"dur":3,"text":"a lot more about what's contained in the\nsyllabus"},"249":{"dur":3,"text":"another common error that students make\nis"},"252":{"dur":6,"text":"p5 is the same as p3 a p3 is one of the\nessential papers business analyses"},"259":{"dur":4,"text":"and perhaps this error in thinking occurs"},"263":{"dur":4,"text":"because there are some similar theories\nbetween the two papers for example"},"268":{"dur":2,"text":"looking at the approach to strategy"},"270":{"dur":3,"text":"looking at Porter's Five Forces and so\non"},"273":{"dur":3,"text":"the bonus for you is that yes you've\nseen those the reason paper P3"},"277":{"dur":4,"text":"and that's not a problem but what you\nwant to think about is as well how is p5"},"281":{"dur":0,"text":"examining them"},"282":{"dur":3,"text":"because it's examining them in a\ndifferent way to paper three and that's"},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"where you need to draw the distinction"},"287":{"dur":3,"text":"the point of paper P5 is about\nmeasuring performance"},"291":{"dur":3,"text":"and performance management that is not\nthe same"},"294":{"dur":3,"text":"as how you define what strategy a company is going to take"},"298":{"dur":3,"text":"and how they're going to implement it and\nthat's where you need to draw those"},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"distinctions we'll talk a little bit\nmore about"},"303":{"dur":3,"text":"that when we look at progression and \nthe underpinning knowledge"},"307":{"dur":3,"text":"that's required for paper P5 later on in\nthe presentation"},"311":{"dur":3,"text":"the fourth misconception that's very\ncommon"},"314":{"dur":3,"text":"is that students choose paper P5 because\nthey have either been told or they've heard"},"318":{"dur":3,"text":"that it's the easiest of the options\npapers"},"321":{"dur":3,"text":"again all of the options papers are set\nat Masters level"},"325":{"dur":4,"text":"so they're all equally as difficult and\nreally what you want to think about"},"330":{"dur":4,"text":"is what is your current position what\nare your future career aspirations"},"334":{"dur":3,"text":"and actually what your interests in\naccounting"},"337":{"dur":3,"text":"do you have an affinity for management\naccounting because if you do"},"341":{"dur":3,"text":"them paper P5 might be the option to\nchoose however if you have a preference"},"345":{"dur":1,"text":"for tax or audit"},"346":{"dur":3,"text":"then clearly those are going to be\nyour preferred choices"},"350":{"dur":3,"text":"okay so don't think that P5 is an\neasy option"},"353":{"dur":6,"text":"they are all equally as difficult as each\nother"},"359":{"dur":4,"text":"so bearing that in mind then we want to\nthink about well what is P5"},"364":{"dur":4,"text":"all about if it's not like paper P3\nthen what is it"},"368":{"dur":3,"text":"well the first core element of paper P5\nis to look at the evolution"},"372":{"dur":3,"text":"and the role of management accounting\nthere's lots of factors that have"},"376":{"dur":2,"text":"influenced organizations"},"378":{"dur":3,"text":"over the last 50 years for example the\ninfluence"},"381":{"dur":4,"text":"of the external environment on\nbusinesses the fact that companies"},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"operate not just domestically but\ninternationally"},"388":{"dur":3,"text":"and therefore their competition and their\ncustomer bases"},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"are spread all over the world that's had\na massive influence"},"395":{"dur":3,"text":"also a lot of internal changes i.e. in the way\nthat staff"},"399":{"dur":4,"text":"are managed the way the organizations\nare structured in terms of"},"403":{"dur":4,"text":"subsidiaries and network structures\nfunctional structures and so on"},"408":{"dur":3,"text":"these have all influenced management\naccounting and of course one of the biggest"},"411":{"dur":3,"text":"factors that influenced it is technology"},"414":{"dur":3,"text":"so one of the things that P5 focuses\non is that change"},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"the change from when a management accountant purely looked at"},"422":{"dur":3,"text":"producing reports, assessing numbers,\nproviding"},"425":{"dur":3,"text":"internal information for manages to take\nin account"},"428":{"dur":4,"text":"all of those external factors and\nbringing all of those in and so now there's"},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"more of a focus on"},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"non-financial information as well as\nfinancial data"},"437":{"dur":3,"text":"qualitative information as well as\nquantitative information"},"441":{"dur":4,"text":"and again having that internal and external\nview"},"446":{"dur":4,"text":"Second element of p5 is linked to that\nchange in management accounting but"},"450":{"dur":3,"text":"the recognition that actually in an\norganization"},"454":{"dur":5,"text":"at the top level strategy is\ninextricably linked to operations"},"460":{"dur":4,"text":"one of the mantras in P5 is that actually\nstrategy can be made or broken"},"465":{"dur":4,"text":"at the operational level and therefore\nin P5 you need to think about"},"469":{"dur":3,"text":"okay this is the strategy of the\norganization"},"472":{"dur":3,"text":"however what will that mean in terms of\nthe way that we translate"},"476":{"dur":4,"text":"that further down the business in terms\nof how employees and managers"},"480":{"dur":4,"text":"are going to react to it how do we\ndecide how we're going to manage their"},"484":{"dur":1,"text":"performance"},"485":{"dur":4,"text":"how we're going to measure results and\nhow we're going to use that information"},"490":{"dur":4,"text":"to then actually decide how we're\ngoing to continue"},"494":{"dur":4,"text":"with our strategic plans whether we need\nto actually bring ourselves back on"},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"track or if we're working well"},"500":{"dur":3,"text":"towards our strategic objectives and\nobviously we need to understand why that"},"504":{"dur":1,"text":"is, and the management accountant role"},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"is important in both of those elements"},"509":{"dur":4,"text":"obviously then I just mentioned that\nlink between strategy and operations"},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"so two of the fundamental elements of\npaper P5 is then looking at what"},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"performance management techniques"},"520":{"dur":3,"text":"are needed and actually performance\nmanagement techniques can cover"},"523":{"dur":3,"text":"everything from traditional techniques\nlike budgeting"},"526":{"dur":3,"text":"costing, variance analyses, topics that\nyou will have seen"},"530":{"dur":4,"text":"in earlier studies but also actually now\nbrings in more modern"},"535":{"dur":3,"text":"management accounting techniques more\nmodern performance management models for"},"538":{"dur":0,"text":"example"},"539":{"dur":3,"text":"the balanced scorecard, the foreman's\npyramid, the performance prism to name a"},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"few"},"545":{"dur":4,"text":"tied in with that then is also how\nwe measure performance"},"549":{"dur":3,"text":"and thinking about how we measure\nperformance that's obviously connected to"},"553":{"dur":4,"text":"the management models that we decide to\nuse but what we want to do is make sure"},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"that we select measurements that again\nare going to allow us"},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"to analyse how the organisation is\ndoing"},"564":{"dur":3,"text":"and therefore that's linked to how was\nthe organisation structured what"},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"strategies is it pursuing"},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"and what sort of behavior we want to get from\nour staff"},"573":{"dur":3,"text":"and this again is linked into the need\nto"},"577":{"dur":4,"text":"focus more on quality,to focus more on\ndifferent types of information systems that"},"581":{"dur":3,"text":"might be required to measure performance"},"584":{"dur":3,"text":"finally p5 is then looking at how"},"588":{"dur":3,"text":"all of these factors i.e. the role of the\nmanagement accountant the link between"},"592":{"dur":4,"text":"strategy and operations what performance\nmanagement and measurement techniques we"},"596":{"dur":0,"text":"use"},"597":{"dur":4,"text":"how they are actually influenced by the\norganisational context"},"602":{"dur":4,"text":"so what you'll notice in paper P5 is\nis that you won't just be dealing with"},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"organizations that have a profit motive"},"608":{"dur":3,"text":"the examiner could easily just give you\nquestions that focus on the public"},"612":{"dur":0,"text":"sector"},"613":{"dur":3,"text":"or a not-for-profit organization and what\nwe"},"616":{"dur":4,"text":"are expecting you to think about there\nis is how some of these models and some"},"620":{"dur":1,"text":"of these measurement techniques"},"622":{"dur":4,"text":"will actually be used differently in\nthose types of environment"},"626":{"dur":3,"text":"that they would be a profit\nseeking organization"},"629":{"dur":4,"text":"so that is really what p5 is aiming at\nwhat you want to be thinking about"},"634":{"dur":4,"text":"in every p5 question that you attempt or\nwhen you're going through the study text"},"638":{"dur":1,"text":"and you are looking at the theories"},"640":{"dur":3,"text":"is you want to thank how will this\ninfluence performance management"},"644":{"dur":3,"text":"and how will this influence performance\nmeasurement that is the mantra"},"648":{"dur":6,"text":"you want to have behind your studies\nwhen you're looking at paper P5"},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"this is the paper P5 syllabus so if\nyou've decided to opt"},"658":{"dur":4,"text":"for paper P5 than hopefully you should have\nalready looked at the syllabus as part"},"662":{"dur":0,"text":"of that"},"663":{"dur":4,"text":"choice process as you can see it is split\nup into six syllabus areas A through to"},"668":{"dur":0,"text":"F"},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"and actually it refers to quite a lot of what i've already mentioned in the previous"},"672":{"dur":0,"text":"slide"},"673":{"dur":3,"text":"I've just summarised it"},"676":{"dur":4,"text":"this is obviously given you a lot more\ndetail so syllabus area A is looking at"},"681":{"dur":1,"text":"obviously the role"},"682":{"dur":3,"text":"of the management accountant in terms\nof planning strategy"},"685":{"dur":4,"text":"but also most importantly controling that\nstrategy and keeping it on track"},"689":{"dur":4,"text":"it then recognises the importance of\nexternal influences"},"694":{"dur":4,"text":"on the organisation not just from a strategic\nperspective but also from an operational"},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"perspective"},"699":{"dur":4,"text":"it then looks at the role of\ninformation systems and how important"},"704":{"dur":5,"text":"appropriate information is in relation\nto planning and control"},"709":{"dur":3,"text":"it then looks at different ways that we\ncan measure performance in particular"},"713":{"dur":3,"text":"looking at strategic performance\nmeasures and that will look at financial"},"716":{"dur":4,"text":"and non-financial performance measures and\nwill also look at different"},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"organizational structures"},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"and how performance is measured in those\nlike we've just been mentioning"},"725":{"dur":4,"text":"what if it's a profit organization a\npublic sector and so on"},"729":{"dur":3,"text":"We will also look at how we can identify\nwhether companies"},"733":{"dur":4,"text":"are in risk of failing so we look at\ncorporate failure models"},"738":{"dur":4,"text":"which is very new to paper 5 and also\nwill look at any new developments in"},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"management accounting so that's actually\nthe mains syllabus"},"745":{"dur":3,"text":"but I think the previous slide what we\ndiscussed first gives you more of"},"749":{"dur":3,"text":"a overview of what paper P5 is\nactually about"},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"What I would  like to now talk about is actually\nhow"},"755":{"dur":5,"text":"paper P5 is built on from the earlier\npapers there in the ACCA syllabus"},"761":{"dur":4,"text":"so paper P5 is right at the top of the\nmanagement accounting pillar"},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"so at the very bottom we have the\nknowledge paper"},"769":{"dur":4,"text":"which is paper F2 which really does give\nyou your first introduction to"},"773":{"dur":1,"text":"management accounting"},"774":{"dur":3,"text":"however F2 is then sort of feeding\ninto F5"},"778":{"dur":3,"text":"and probably F5 is perhaps the most\nimportant paper"},"782":{"dur":3,"text":"for you to be aware of if you're going\nto choose P5"},"786":{"dur":4,"text":"so one of the things to think about when\nyou're choosing an options paper and if"},"790":{"dur":3,"text":"you're choosing p5 is to think about how\nmuch you recall"},"793":{"dur":3,"text":"from your F5 paper and if you've been\nexempt from"},"797":{"dur":5,"text":"F5 you need to make sure that you\ncan get access to some of the core"},"802":{"dur":4,"text":"subjects that are in the F5 exam because\nobviously some of those"},"806":{"dur":4,"text":"can still be reexamined at P5 level\nnow it's not that they're going to be"},"810":{"dur":3,"text":"examined exactly the same because F5 is\nfocusing more on"},"814":{"dur":4,"text":"how do you do the technique, what's the\nrationale behind the technique"},"818":{"dur":4,"text":"what are its pros and cons and so on where as in paper P5"},"822":{"dur":3,"text":"you'll be expected more to evaluate the\ntechnique again"},"825":{"dur":3,"text":"within the context that the examiner is\ngiving you so for example"},"829":{"dur":4,"text":"is this budgeting process appropriate\nfor this type of organization"},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"or should they be looking at\nintroducing something else and why would"},"837":{"dur":1,"text":"that be"},"838":{"dur":4,"text":"so you gonna have to be thinking about\nit from a more analytical perspective"},"842":{"dur":3,"text":"but it is useful to make sure that you\ncan access some of"},"845":{"dur":3,"text":"that previous information from the\nearlier paper"},"849":{"dur":3,"text":"now as you can see there is a connection\nto paper P3 which we've already"},"853":{"dur":3,"text":"talked about but as I've already stressed\nto you"},"856":{"dur":3,"text":"the points of that is is to show you that\nthere is"},"859":{"dur":4,"text":"a connection between the two of them\nthey do share some theories but remember"},"864":{"dur":3,"text":"already said they approach the\napplication of those theories"},"867":{"dur":3,"text":"in a very different way and you need to\ncome into that mindset"},"871":{"dur":3,"text":"in paper P5 the you are looking at it\nfrom that perspective"},"875":{"dur":5,"text":"and that you are not still sitting with\nyour p3 head on"},"880":{"dur":3,"text":"so what I'd like to talk about is\nactually"},"883":{"dur":3,"text":"perhaps some of the more specific areas\nthat you need to remember"},"886":{"dur":3,"text":"from F5 so we talked about the need\nto refresh your knowledge"},"890":{"dur":3,"text":"but obviously you don't need to go back and learn\nthe whole f5 syllabus again"},"894":{"dur":3,"text":"there are just some elements of it that\nyou need to understand"},"897":{"dur":3,"text":"need to think about why they're\nconnected to paper P5 also"},"901":{"dur":4,"text":"more about how it's going to be\nexamined in paper P5"},"905":{"dur":3,"text":"so one of the first areas to\nrefresh is from the costing section"},"909":{"dur":2,"text":"of F5 and that's activity based costing"},"911":{"dur":4,"text":"now activity based costing is important\nthe p5 because p5 looks at"},"916":{"dur":4,"text":"the concept about activity based management\nand therefore activity based management"},"921":{"dur":3,"text":"is actually based on the principles of\nactivity-based costing so you could be"},"924":{"dur":1,"text":"asked to do some simple"},"926":{"dur":3,"text":"ABC calculations"},"929":{"dur":4,"text":"secondly we could look at different\ntypes of budgetary systems"},"933":{"dur":4,"text":"again the examiner in P5 isn't going to be\nasking you to define"},"937":{"dur":3,"text":"the different types of budgetary systems\nas i've mentioned already it's going to"},"941":{"dur":3,"text":"be more about what's appropriate for the\norganization"},"944":{"dur":4,"text":"another important element the p5 is how\nthat will influence behavior"},"948":{"dur":3,"text":"in the organization so if staff for\nexample"},"952":{"dur":4,"text":"are very much constrained by a budget\nhow is that going to affect the way that"},"956":{"dur":1,"text":"they look at achieving their targets"},"958":{"dur":4,"text":"the way that they look at investment the\nway they will look at non-financial performance"},"963":{"dur":3,"text":"if they're so focused on hitting for\nexample a profit target"},"967":{"dur":3,"text":"so that's the sort of thing will be\nlooking at in p5"},"970":{"dur":4,"text":"we also look at some of the\nmore numeric techniques for example cost"},"975":{"dur":1,"text":"volume profit analysis"},"977":{"dur":3,"text":"risk and uncertainty, limiting factors"},"980":{"dur":3,"text":"but again they're not going to be\nexamined at the same sort of technical"},"984":{"dur":0,"text":"depth"},"985":{"dur":4,"text":"as you would get in F5 because\nobviously you spent all your time in a"},"989":{"dur":4,"text":"F5 doing the calculations were not\ninterested in regurgitating that in P5 again"},"994":{"dur":1,"text":"it's more about how these"},"995":{"dur":4,"text":"techniques can help the organization\nmake decisions"},"999":{"dur":4,"text":"so for example with CVP analysis you\ncould be expected to do some basic"},"1004":{"dur":2,"text":"break-even calculations"},"1006":{"dur":3,"text":"but again it's more for providing\ninformation for managers"},"1010":{"dur":3,"text":"so that they can actually make those\ndecisions as we've mentioned"},"1013":{"dur":3,"text":"again the same elements apply to risk\nand uncertainty"},"1017":{"dur":3,"text":"there is inherently risk in any business\ndecision that's made so it's important"},"1020":{"dur":4,"text":"for management accountants to be able to\nanalyze that risk and again provide"},"1025":{"dur":2,"text":"analysis for managers"},"1027":{"dur":4,"text":"also with limiting factors you're not\ngoing to get questions in P5 that focus on"},"1031":{"dur":3,"text":"things light linear programming and so\non all those complex graphs from earlier"},"1035":{"dur":0,"text":"studies"},"1036":{"dur":3,"text":"but what you can get is obviously\nthinking about"},"1039":{"dur":3,"text":"what happens if a company has resource\nrestrictions"},"1042":{"dur":4,"text":"what do they do how did they manage that \nand obviously that

clearly\nthere he restates the mission statement"},"2852":{"dur":3,"text":"so if you go back to paragraph one where\nyou've got this original mission statement"},"2856":{"dur":1,"text":"and you look at"},"2857":{"dur":3,"text":"the final paragraph you will see\nwhat's changed natually what he is including"},"2860":{"dur":1,"text":"now in the new mission"},"2862":{"dur":3,"text":"is an element
