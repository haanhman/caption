you say that\nthe amount of time"},"442":{"dur":3,"text":"that you spend negotiating,\nhas it stayed pretty steady?"},"446":{"dur":1,"text":"Does it go down\nover time as you

Up."},"454":{"dur":1,"text":"WILLIAM URY: How many\nsay it's going up?"},"456":{"dur":1,"text":"OK, almost all of you."},"457":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's the negotiation\nrevolution in

remember when it first"},"498":{"dur":4,"text":"came out, there were\nsome Russian friends"},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"who wanted to translate\nit into Russian,"},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"but they thought\nnegotiation was subversive."},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"They didn't want\nto teach people how"},"508":{"dur":3,"text":"to negotiate because then they\nwould challenge authority."},"512":{"dur":3,"text":"But now there are\nRussian editions of it."},"516":{"dur":4,"text":"So one thing that I think might\nbe useful just for the next,"},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"you know,

at\nleast one in mind?"},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"So let me ask you a\nquick question then"},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"about the one you just selected."},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"There are maybe two types of\nnegotiations we engage in,"},"552":{"dur":3,"text":"the internal negotiations\ninside the organization"},"556":{"dur":1,"text":"with our colleagues\nand coworkers"},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"and so on, and then there are\nthe external negotiations,"},"561":{"dur":2,"text":"let's say, with clients,\nfor example, or suppliers."},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"How many of you, just\nout of curiosity,"},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"have just selected an\nexternal situation?"},"568":{"dur":0,"text":"External."},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"How many of you selected\nan internal situation?"},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"OK."},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"And just out of\ncuriosity, if you"},"576":{"dur":5,"text":"had to say which one was\nharder, the negotiation inside"},"582":{"dur":1,"text":"or the negotiation\noutside, if you"},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"had to just make a broad\ngeneralization, which"},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"personally do you\nfind more challenging?"},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"Internal negotiations\nor external?"},"589":{"dur":0,"text":"AUDIENCE: Internal."},"590":{"dur":0,"text":"AUDIENCE: Internal."},"591":{"dur":1,"text":"WILLIAM

both\ncan be challenging."},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"But the great majority\nof hands go up"},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"on internal, which is\ninteresting that oftentimes we"},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"experience the more challenging\nnegotiations as being"},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"the ones with the people\nwith whom supposedly we're"},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"on the same team working for\nthe same mission, whatever,"},"612":{"dur":3,"text":"but those are often\nmore challenging."},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"Well over the years, my\npassion over the years"},"619":{"dur":3,"text":"has been helping people\nget to yes, individuals,"},"622":{"dur":3,"text":"organizations, societies, as\nBrian was mentioning, even"},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"in war-like situations."},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"And the thing that sort of\nstruck me over the years"},"632":{"dur":4,"text":"is when my colleagues and\nI wrote \"Getting to Yes,\""},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"the most frequent question\nwe got for a while was, yeah,"},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"but how do you get to\nyes with the people who"},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"don't want to get\nto yes, you know?"},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"How do you deal\nwith people who are"},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"kind of rigid and\nthey're intransigent"},"645":{"dur":3,"text":"or they're using dirty tricks,\nor all kinds of things?"},"648":{"dur":3,"text":"So I kind of specialized\nin that for a long time."},"652":{"dur":1,"text":"In fact, my follow\non book was a book"},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"called \"Getting Past No,\"\nwhich was negotiating"},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"with difficult\npeople, negotiating"},"657":{"dur":1,"text":"in difficult situations."},"659":{"dur":5,"text":"But over the years I began to\nrealize that in fact, perhaps"},"665":{"dur":1,"text":"the most difficult\nperson we have"},"667":{"dur":3,"text":"to deal with in a negotiation,\nin the process of getting"},"670":{"dur":1,"text":"to yes, be it with\nour teenagers,"},"672":{"dur":3,"text":"our spouses, our\ncoworkers, or our clients,"},"675":{"dur":1,"text":"is not what we think it is."},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not just the\ndifficult person"},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"on the other side of\nthe table, as difficult"},"681":{"dur":1,"text":"as that person can be."},"683":{"dur":1,"text":"Actually the biggest\nobstacle to us"},"684":{"dur":3,"text":"getting what we want in\nnegotiation, curiously enough,"},"688":{"dur":0,"text":"is right here."},"689":{"dur":0,"text":"It's ourselves."},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"It's the person on\nthis side of the table."},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"It's the person we\nlook at in the mirror."},"695":{"dur":4,"text":"Because after all, what\ncould be more internal?"},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"It feels to me like the more\ninternal the negotiation goes,"},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"the more difficult it is."},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"What could be more\ninternal than ourselves?"},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"And so our biggest\nopponent actually,"},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"the person who's going to\ngive us the most trouble"},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"often is the person we're\nlooking at in the mirror."},"713":{"dur":1,"text":"I think it was\nTeddy Roosevelt who"},"714":{"dur":1,"text":"once said, if you\ncould kick in the pants"},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"the person who's going to give\nyou the most trouble that day,"},"718":{"dur":3,"text":"you wouldn't sit for a month."},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"And so to me, that\nobstacle can also"},"725":{"dur":4,"text":"become our biggest opportunity."},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"If we can turn our\nown inner opponent,"},"732":{"dur":1,"text":"as it were, into\nour biggest ally."},"734":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's really the subject\nof this book, my newest book,"},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"which is \"Getting to Yes with\nYourself and Other Worthy"},"741":{"dur":1,"text":"Opponents.\""},"742":{"dur":3,"text":"And where it lies\nis to me it lies"},"746":{"dur":4,"text":"in our very understandable,\nvery natural human tendency"},"751":{"dur":1,"text":"to react."},"752":{"dur":1,"text":"In other words, to\nact without thinking."},"754":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, negotiation is supposed\nto be goal oriented behavior."},"757":{"dur":3,"text":"You're looking rationally\nto advance your objective."},"760":{"dur":5,"text":"But oftentimes our own emotions,\nfor example, get in the way."},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"As Ambrose Bierce\none said, when angry,"},"769":{"dur":4,"text":"you will make the best\nspeech you will ever regret."},"773":{"dur":3,"text":"And it happens a lot these days."},"777":{"dur":1,"text":"And so the first and most\nimportant negotiation"},"779":{"dur":1,"text":"And I want to talk a\nlittle bit about that,"},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"but then I don't want\nto go too deep into this"},"784":{"dur":1,"text":"without really\ndrawing you out more"},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"and getting into\nyour own situations."},"788":{"dur":3,"text":"But just to highlight a couple\nof points here from this."},"791":{"dur":5,"text":"To me, interestingly,\nthe foundation"},"796":{"dur":5,"text":"of being able to get\nto yes with yourself"},"801":{"dur":3,"text":"is the ability to step\nback from the situation."},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"And I like to use the\nmetaphor going to the balcony."},"808":{"dur":1,"text":"It's almost like\nyou're negotiating"},"810":{"dur":1,"text":"with the other\nperson on a stage."},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"Part of your mind goes to a\nmental or emotional balcony"},"815":{"dur":3,"text":"overlooking that\nstage where it's"},"818":{"dur":3,"text":"a place of calm, of perspective,\nof self-control, where you"},"822":{"dur":4,"text":"above all can keep\nyour eyes on the prize."},"827":{"dur":3,"text":"And for example,\nthese days there's"},"831":{"dur":2,"text":"so much going on in our lives."},"833":{"dur":2,"text":"We get texts, we get\nemails, we get

satisfaction"},"856":{"dur":1,"text":"of hitting the Reply\nbutton, but you don't just"},"858":{"dur":0,"text":"hit the Reply button."},"859":{"dur":1,"text":"You hit the Reply\nAll button and

OK."},"1563":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah, well maybe I can\ngive myself that freedom."},"1566":{"dur":2,"text":"So there was this kind of\npsychological antecedent"},"1569":{"dur":1,"text":"there inside
