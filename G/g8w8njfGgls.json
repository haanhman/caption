we had some of\nthese monstrous things"},"383":{"dur":1,"text":"happen, like in\n\"Scrooged\" we had"},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"a character, who was\nthe director, who"},"386":{"dur":3,"text":"was-- it

before."},"418":{"dur":1,"text":"Who's been through\nsomething horrible."},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"And then you don't have\nthat, there's no fear"},"422":{"dur":3,"text":"and you realize, well, if you\njust keep playing your game--"},"426":{"dur":1,"text":"MITCH GLAZER: And\nmy feeling always"},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"is when we work together,\nwhen we write together,"},"430":{"dur":3,"text":"that if it makes us laugh\nor moves us, then I'm cool."},"434":{"dur":5,"text":"Then I go in armored and I can't\nbe challenged because that's"},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"the first initial hurdle."},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"The person you want to please\nis your writing partner."},"444":{"dur":1,"text":"We've written the\nscript

partly"},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"that, I guess a lot\nof it is being in it."},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"483":{"dur":3,"text":"But, I just do the ones I\nlike, I don't have any agenda,"},"487":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't have any\nkind of move that I"},"488":{"dur":1,"text":"want to go a certain\nway, particularly."},"490":{"dur":3,"text":"I've just had this funny\ncareer where I started out"},"493":{"dur":4,"text":"doing comedies, and then I ended\nup doing more serious roles."},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"And I wasn't intending\nto do it that way."},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"Now this movie's funny again."},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"We do have a mutual\nfriend who said,"},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"when I was lying on\nmy back in Venice"},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"at the end of some\n[INTENTIONALLY MUMBLES]"},"510":{"dur":3,"text":"he said, Bill, you know,\nyou do these sad movies"},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"and you end up taking\nthem home with you."},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, your life\nisn't always fun anyway,"},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"maybe you should think\nabout doing something funny."},"522":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's a funny-- when you're\nlying on your back on marble,"},"525":{"dur":1,"text":"it just changes everything."},"527":{"dur":3,"text":"Because you're a little\nbit more receptive."},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"But this just happened to\ncome up not hard upon that,"},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"but soon after there\nwas a movie where"},"537":{"dur":1,"text":"there was a chance to be funny."},"538":{"dur":4,"text":"And I thought, I do believe\nthat if you can write,"},"543":{"dur":0,"text":"you must write."},"544":{"dur":3,"text":"And I do believe if you can\nbe funny, you should be funny."},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"People need funny,\nthey need funny."},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: Moving on from\nthat terrible question I just"},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"BILL MURRAY: No, that's\nOK, I tried to help."},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: Bill Murray\nhelped me, all right."},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"So the interesting\nthing about this movie"},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"was Richie Lanz tries to bring\na lot of American culture--"},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"BILL MURRAY: Have\nyou seen this movie?"},"567":{"dur":0,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, we\njust saw it last

MURRAY: Good, we've still\ngot some major box office"},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"to corral in this room."},"577":{"dur":1,"text":"OK, so you saw it, go ahead."},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: Which [INAUDIBLE]\nbring a lot of American culture"},"581":{"dur":0,"text":"into Afghanistan."},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"You guys filmed in Morocco, so\nit wasn't quite Afghanistan,"},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"but what did you\nsee in that culture"},"587":{"dur":3,"text":"that maybe we should be bringing\nback here to the Western world?"},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"MITCH GLAZER: It was amazing\nactually because we filmed it"},"593":{"dur":5,"text":"during Ramadan, July of\n2014, June\/July 2014."},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"And there were options, I\nwas telling Billy earlier,"},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"you know producers are saying\nyou should do it in New Mexico."},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"But from the\nbeginning, the movie"},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"had to have the feel\nof a Muslim world."},"608":{"dur":0,"text":"It just did."},"609":{"dur":4,"text":"It We're really\nserious about that."},"613":{"dur":3,"text":"So half our crew was a\nMuslim crew, and experiencing"},"617":{"dur":1,"text":"Ramadan with them."},"619":{"dur":4,"text":"And Bill kind of insists\nthat you take a huge bite out"},"623":{"dur":1,"text":"of life wherever you are."},"624":{"dur":4,"text":"But there you are in\nMarrakesh, in Morocco."},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"He had two of his sons with\nhim, and on weekends my wife"},"632":{"dur":1,"text":"and I would join them."},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"Went to Fez, and\nRabat, and Essaouira,"},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"they went up to the\nAtlas Mountains."},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"We really did, I mean we\nleft after seven weeks,"},"640":{"dur":1,"text":"and Bill stayed."},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"Because it was so, so powerful."},"644":{"dur":3,"text":"But there are moments\nthere that are,"},"647":{"dur":1,"text":"they'll be with me forever."},"648":{"dur":3,"text":"Just the beauty of\nthe city, the culture,"},"651":{"dur":4,"text":"and getting a chance to work in\na place like that was a dream."},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"And we also did\nshoot with, there's"},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"a woman named\n[? Golora ?] who works"},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"for \"Vice,\" who shot all the\nKabul footage in the movie."},"664":{"dur":2,"text":"So anytime you\ndon't see an actor,"},"666":{"dur":4,"text":"but it's all of the footage of\npeople watching the TVs, all"},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"that was from Afghanistan."},"673":{"dur":3,"text":"And beautifully shot,\nand seamless, really."},"676":{"dur":1,"text":"I thought it was,\nreally was a magical two"},"678":{"dur":1,"text":"months for all of us."},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"And the movie, at the end of the\nday is about what's universal."},"682":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, really, not\nwhat separates us,"},"684":{"dur":5,"text":"but a father loves his\ndaughter, everybody loves music,"},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"and loves to laugh."},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"And who better to\ntake us through that?"},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"BILL MURRAY: I don't know if\nany of you have been to Morocco,"},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"it's a beautiful place\nI strongly recommend it"},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"as a place to visit and see."},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"And I made a joke the other day."},"704":{"dur":3,"text":"It's entry level Africa."},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"You get in, and it's\nsort of the easiest way,"},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"into sort of going, oh it's\na whole different world here."},"712":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's sort of entry\nlevel Muslim world, too."},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"Because it's a predominantly\nMuslim country."},"718":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's what we might call\nlike a soft, or gentler, less"},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"strident Muslim country."},"725":{"dur":3,"text":"Like Indonesia is\neasier, and it's not"},"729":{"dur":1,"text":"you have some sort\nof anticipation,"},"730":{"dur":5,"text":"or fear, or anxiety about some\nsort of reactionary Muslim."},"736":{"dur":3,"text":"And these are people that read\nthe book the way it reads."},"739":{"dur":4,"text":"They don't re-interpret it in\na bizarre and unusual fashion."},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"It's pretty straightforward."},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we come there\nwith American culture,"},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"that's your question."},"751":{"dur":1,"text":"We come there with our\nAmerican movie making,"},"752":{"dur":1,"text":"and the way we treat people."},"754":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, the Ramadan thing\nwas a very big thing."},"757":{"dur":2,"text":"You know what Ramadan is,\npeople don't eat or drink"},"760":{"dur":1,"text":"in the daylight hours."},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"And because this was\na late Ramadan in July"},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"these are the longest days, one\nof the longer days of the year."},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"So it was a bad time to\nbe-- and the hottest."},"771":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's just a\nstruggle, everyone's"},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"struggling through it."},"776":{"dur":3,"text":"Even if you're not a Muslim,\nyou feel the struggle"},"779":{"dur":1,"text":"all around you."},"781":{"dur":4,"text":"And that sort of relationship\nthat you get with someone,"},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"where this is how I treat you."},"788":{"dur":0,"text":"This is how we talk."},"789":{"dur":3,"text":"This is how we walk back\nand forth to the job."},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"This is how we carry\nsomething together."},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"This is how we move\naround in a circle."},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"This is how we walk\nback and forth to lunch."},"800":{"dur":5,"text":"All that-- there's a\ngerm that lands in you,"},"805":{"dur":2,"text":"it was probably given to\nus much earlier in life,"},"808":{"dur":4,"text":"but that connection\ngrows through the time,"},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"so when the time comes,\nwhen the days get hard,"},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"and the days are long,\nand movie days are long,"},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"they're insufferably long."},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's no\npoint in the locals"},"823":{"dur":2,"text":"to quit before they\ncan eat, anyway."},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"So they just want to\nkeep going because if we"},"827":{"dur":2,"text":"stay working on the\njob until dark, then"},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"we get to eat on the movie."},"832":{"dur":2,"text":"And then we all break\nbread and we stop."},"835":{"dur":1,"text":"And that was good."},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"People didn't have to drive\nall the way to their homes,"},"838":{"dur":1,"text":"the movie provided a meal."},"840":{"dur":3,"text":"When the sun went down,\nwe stopped and we ate."},"843":{"dur":3,"text":"And even if we had to keep\ngoing, we stopped and we ate."},"847":{"dur":1,"text":"And everyone stopped\nand ate, and all"},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"the different departments\nwent, we don't work now,"},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"we stop and we eat as a group."},"854":{"dur":1,"text":"MITCH GLAZER: You\nfeel it on screen."},"856":{"dur":5,"text":"You feel, as Bill says, the\nthat exotic and the unusual"},"862":{"dur":2,"text":"and the magical of it on screen."},"864":{"dur":0,"text":"Really, really does."},"865":{"dur":0,"text":"BILL MURRAY: I\nnoticed it last night,"},"866":{"dur":2,"text":"we watched the screen-- or\ntwo nights ago, whenever"},"868":{"dur":1,"text":"we saw the movie again."},"870":{"dur":1,"text":"And the credits\nroll, and you're used"},"871":{"dur":3,"text":"to seeing show business\nnames, like, hey there's Wally"},"874":{"dur":3,"text":"Westmore, or some\nguy that you know."},"877":{"dur":1,"text":"And they're all Muslim

names,"},"894":{"dur":1,"text":"you never knew anyone's\nentire name, which"},"896":{"dur":2,"text":"could be three or four words."},"898":{"dur":2,"text":"But the fact that here's\nthis American

first,"},"913":{"dur":0,"text":"right?"},"914":{"dur":1,"text":"MITCH GLAZER: It was amazing."},"915":{"dur":3,"text":"And I got to say, neither\nof us had done it,"},"919":{"dur":2,"text":"but it was in that big room\nin the 6,500 seater or 7,000"},"922":{"dur":2,"text":"And his entrance was\nto \"Smoke on the Water\""},"925":{"dur":1,"text":"through the back of the
