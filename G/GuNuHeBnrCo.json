types of costs"},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"that you encounter as a citizen."},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's create some boxes of costs"},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"that cumulatively add up to being

you're eligible for it,"},"589":{"dur":4,"text":"how much it'll actually benefit\nyou, how you actually apply."},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"This seems very straightforward,"},"597":{"dur":3,"text":"but a lot of people are\nnot aware of the fact"},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"that they're eligible for many\nsocial programs for example."},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"So something like the\nearned income tax

eligible"},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"are unaware that the program exists."},"617":{"dur":1,"text":"About a third of those who are eligible"},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"believe incorrectly\nthat they're ineligible"},"621":{"dur":1,"text":"and they consistently underestimate"},"623":{"dur":4,"text":"the benefits that they\nwould get from the program."},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"We see similar numbers of estimates"},"630":{"dur":4,"text":"for people who are eligible\nfor SNAP or food stamps"},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"or job training programs."},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"And you might also assume that"},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"some of the barriers that we found"},"642":{"dur":3,"text":"that explain take-up of social programs"},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"might be a function of learning costs."},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you live further away\nfrom an administration center"},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"you're less likely to\ntake up on a program,"},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"if you have

other hand, there are things"},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"that we might assume reduce learning."},"677":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you're a union\nmember and get laid off"},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"you're more likely to\nget unemployment benefits"},"683":{"dur":4,"text":"because the union will help\nyou through that process."},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're a veteran seeking

you have to fill out,"},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"answer the same question 14 times,"},"844":{"dur":2,"text":"I'd submit that feels\nless like co-production"},"847":{"dur":1,"text":"and more like a waste
