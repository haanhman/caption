a"},"586":{"dur":4,"text":"bit bluer so that object is moving towards us or\naway from us."},"591":{"dur":1,"text":"But again, we have the same problem that we"},"593":{"dur":4,"text":"don't

us."},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"But we can be a little bit cleverer than that."},"619":{"dur":5,"text":"Because stars emit light in a whole range of colours."},"625":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, this is the light coming from the Sun,"},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"all the different colours that make up the light"},"630":{"dur":1,"text":"that we see from the Sun."},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, remember that we

you get these black bands where"},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"we don\u2019t see any of the light from the Sun"},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"because the atoms have all absorbed it."},"696":{"dur":4,"text":"So we have this reference from the Sun and now"},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"we can go out and measure the light from"},"702":{"dur":5,"text":"distant stars and we can see what their spectrum\nlooks

the Sun and yet they've all"},"725":{"dur":6,"text":"consistently moved upwards, moved towards\nthe red."},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"And the fact that we see the same

them; we see them all shifted\nacross a little bit."},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"That tells us that the light, the frequency of the"},"747":{"dur":5,"text":"wavelength of the light has been shifted

spectrum tells us that"},"770":{"dur":3,"text":"this super cluster has to be moving away from us."},"773":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay, so now we have two things that we"},"778":{"dur":3,"text":"think we can

I"},"832":{"dur":2,"text":"think for our purposes, it's really nicely summed up"},"835":{"dur":3,"text":"by this quote from John Wheeler, which tells you"},"839":{"dur":5,"text":"that space-time, so

point."},"895":{"dur":4,"text":"What there is in the universe determines how\nit evolves."},"900":{"dur":3,"text":"So that tells us that distance and velocity are"},"903":{"dur":3,"text":"potentially related, so if the universe is expanding,"},"907":{"dur":2,"text":"that expansion is controlled by what is in the"},"910":{"dur":3,"text":"universe through this theory of general

more they're moving away from us."},"969":{"dur":2,"text":"The larger the number on the vertical axis,"},"972":{"dur":2,"text":"the further away from us an object is."},"974":{"dur":2,"text":"And so

curve going through here,"},"993":{"dur":3,"text":"telling us that distance and velocities are related."},"997":{"dur":2,"text":"And we have our theory of general relativity
