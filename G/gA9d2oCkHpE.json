I'd really like\npeople to understand is I think that"},"2437":{"dur":3,"text":"most of the people who interview me\nask me what my hidden agenda is."},"2442":{"dur":4,"text":"And there's an

important."},"2482":{"dur":3,"text":"That's what I want people to think,\nthat's all we want."},"2485":{"dur":4,"text":"We want Americans to think\nthat there is a possibility

before I give my answer,\nlet me apologize for my answer,"},"2571":{"dur":5,"text":"because I completely disagree\nwith almost everything you said."},"2577":{"dur":1,"text":"We actually did a study on this."},"2578":{"dur":4,"text":"So we did a study what happens to\nemployment if we move to clean energy."},"2583":{"dur":2,"text":"We can't move to clean energy tomorrow."},"2585":{"dur":4,"text":"It's always going to\nbe a question of pace."},"2589":{"dur":2,"text":"But we did a study with Hank Paulson,"},"2592":{"dur":4,"text":"the Republican Secretary

that it\nwasn't a partisan's fight."},"2604":{"dur":5,"text":"And it basically showed, that in fact, if\nwe moved to clean energy, it creates more"},"2609":{"dur":6,"text":"jobs, that we will have

there will be more jobs, and"},"2639":{"dur":3,"text":"it's true the jobs will be better paying,\nbut not for the same people."},"2643":{"dur":2,"text":"So the question is,\nwhat are you going to do?"},"2645":{"dur":5,"text":"My roommate, my ex-roommate lives in\nthe poorest county in West Virginia."},"2651":{"dur":2,"text":"His brother-in-law is\nan unemployed coal miner, and"},"2653":{"dur":1,"text":"his cousin is an unemployed coal miner."},"2655":{"dur":1,"text":"So I went down to see him,"},"2657":{"dur":4,"text":"he's a retired career army officer\nwith some health problems."},"2662":{"dur":2,"text":"And I went down, and he was telling me,"},"2664":{"dur":2,"text":"if you're a coal miner today,\nyou make 82 bucks an hour."},"2668":{"dur":4,"text":"Which, in the poorest county in West\nVirginia, is an unbelievable amount of"},"2673":{"dur":3,"text":"money, and the next stop is\nprobably 25 bucks an hour."},"2676":{"dur":4,"text":"So coal mining is not\nthe world's greatest job."},"2680":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a really well paid\njob with good benefits."},"2683":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's really what\nwe're talking about."},"2685":{"dur":4,"text":"We're talking about what are we going\nto do for the people in our society who"},"2690":{"dur":5,"text":"think, look, there are 50,000 coal\nminers in the United States of America."},"2695":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a very, very, very,\nvery small number of people,"},"2699":{"dur":4,"text":"but there's a broader question here,\nand that's what Trump was referring to."},"2703":{"dur":3,"text":"There are a group of people in the United\nStates of America who do not live in"},"2707":{"dur":1,"text":"Palo Alto, California."},"2708":{"dur":2,"text":"They do not live in New York City."},"2711":{"dur":5,"text":"They do not live in the parts of\nthe country that are seeing real growth."},"2716":{"dur":3,"text":"They are not connected to\nthe information technology revolution."},"2720":{"dur":4,"text":"They are not connected to the positive\naspects of globalization."},"2724":{"dur":3,"text":"And they can see the climate changing,\nbut for"},"2727":{"dur":5,"text":"them, that is not the immediate\nproblem they're dealing with."},"2732":{"dur":2,"text":"That's just something that\nmay put them out of work."},"2735":{"dur":3,"text":"So they feel completely\nscared by the fact,"},"2738":{"dur":3,"text":"all of the fact that\nthe world is changing."},"2741":{"dur":4,"text":"That people in Palo Alto go like, whoa,\njust killed it on my latest investment."},"2746":{"dur":3,"text":"They're going, whoa, the world is\nchanging, and they just closed the plant."},"2750":{"dur":4,"text":"And there's only one plant, or\nthey just closed the coal mine, and"},"2754":{"dur":1,"text":"now what do we do?"},"2755":{"dur":3,"text":"But now we're going to get less than half\nthe dollars per hour that we thought we"},"2758":{"dur":2,"text":"were going to get or that we were getting."},"2761":{"dur":3,"text":"So the question to me is not\nthe macro question you asked,"},"2765":{"dur":1,"text":"but the micro question."},"2766":{"dur":3,"text":"What do we say to the people\nin rural America or"},"2770":{"dur":4,"text":"poor urban America who are not\nconnected to the growth for"},"2774":{"dur":5,"text":"whom the rapid pace of change in\nour society is scary as anything?"},"2779":{"dur":4,"text":"And that is what Trump was dealing with,\nthat fear, that uncertainty, and"},"2784":{"dur":4,"text":"that sense that no one was listening."},"2788":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think his answer\nwas a dishonest one."},"2791":{"dur":5,"text":"And I think it was absolutely, we're\nnot going back to a lot of coal miners."},"2798":{"dur":2,"text":"Even if we dug a ton more coal,\nit's all mechanized."},"2800":{"dur":5,"text":"No one is going into a coal face with\na pick and shovel anymore, period."},"2805":{"dur":4,"text":"But it was a perfect symbol for\ngoing back to a time when being"},"2810":{"dur":4,"text":"a hard working American who was\nwilling to go to work every day and"},"2814":{"dur":5,"text":"kill yourself meant you got a middle\nclass job, including in rural America."},"2820":{"dur":4,"text":"So the question is when we talk to those\npeople who are hard working and scared,"},"2824":{"dur":2,"text":"how are we actually,\nnot how are we going to fake it,"},"2827":{"dur":2,"text":"how are we actually going to include them?"},"2830":{"dur":2,"text":"And to me, the question is two-fold."},"2832":{"dur":2,"text":"One is, we need to invest in\nthe people of the United States."},"2836":{"dur":2,"text":"That means education, training."},"2838":{"dur":4,"text":"We need to connect them to this world\nthat you guys are in right here in this"},"2843":{"dur":0,"text":"auditorium."},"2844":{"dur":2,"text":"If you don't have\nbroadband in the community,"},"2847":{"dur":2,"text":"you cannot compete in the first world."},"2850":{"dur":3,"text":"When I was in West Virginia,\nthe roads were bad, literally."},"2855":{"dur":2,"text":"So the question is,\nif you're in that community,"},"2858":{"dur":5,"text":"how can you possibly compete in this\nworld or even be part of this world?"},"2863":{"dur":2,"text":"And this includes rural California."},"2866":{"dur":3,"text":"If you're not connected real-time,\nit can't happen."},"2869":{"dur":3,"text":"Secondly, if we're not investing in\nthose people, we lose, they lose,"},"2873":{"dur":1,"text":"the country loses."},"2874":{"dur":4,"text":"The idea that we're going to\ncut education, training,"},"2879":{"dur":4,"text":"healthcare, food for\npoor kids from the budget is insane."},"2885":{"dur":2,"text":"It's morally wrong, but it's also crazy."},"2888":{"dur":2,"text":"This country will do well\nif Americans do well."},"2891":{"dur":3,"text":"We should be taking our money and\ninvesting in those people."},"2894":{"dur":3,"text":"So that they think I'm going\nto be connected to the world,"},"2898":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to be trained for the world."},"2899":{"dur":5,"text":"I'm going to participate in this world,\nin the 21st century, so that every change"},"2904":{"dur":4,"text":"doesn't actually push me further away\nfrom what's going on in the real world."},"2909":{"dur":6,"text":"Because if we were in rural Wisconsin,\nand there was one plant in our town,"},"2917":{"dur":3,"text":"and that plant closed, we wouldn't\nknow what to do either, except leave."},"2923":{"dur":1,"text":"That's what's going on in this world."},"2924":{"dur":5,"text":"We need to invest and frankly, clean\nenergy, it means rebuilding this country,"},"2930":{"dur":6,"text":"and it actually means this country\nwith millions of net new jobs."},"2936":{"dur":1,"text":"We have to do it."},"2937":{"dur":6,"text":"It's a way for us in the short-term to get\nevery community rural, poor urban people."},"2944":{"dur":3,"text":"People in rural America,\nwe have to do it every where."},"2947":{"dur":1,"text":"It's good jobs every where."},"2948":{"dur":3,"text":"The question is,\nwhat do the jobs pay and who gets them?"},"2952":{"dur":5,"text":"The last thing I'll say is this, I was\nin Cleveland talking to some inner city"},"2958":{"dur":4,"text":"ministers about clean energy jobs,\nand they were excited,"},"2963":{"dur":5,"text":"I promise you, at the idea that we\ncould bring thousands of jobs to urban,"},"2968":{"dur":5,"text":"poor Cleveland with high unemployment for\ntheir people, in their communities."},"2975":{"dur":1,"text":"It's true in rural Wisconsin too."},"2977":{"dur":4,"text":"So when I hear it I know he's talking,\nthe president was dealing with"},"2982":{"dur":4,"text":"a real emotional problem that is\nabsolutely felt in this country but"},"2987":{"dur":2,"text":"he wasn't giving a fair answer."},"2989":{"dur":4,"text":"And the answer I'm giving about invest\nin Americans, rebuild the country and"},"2993":{"dur":4,"text":"connect us all together, is actually the\nway that somebody living in a rural part"},"2997":{"dur":3,"text":"of this country can connect\nwith you guys in this room."},"3001":{"dur":3,"text":"Or you can choose to live in\na rural part of California and"},"3004":{"dur":2,"text":"still connect with the fastest growing,"},"3006":{"dur":5,"text":"most vibrant companies in the world.\n>> We are almost out of time,"},"3012":{"dur":3,"text":"so I'm just going to take the final\nquestion, so we can wrap up, so"},"3015":{"dur":2,"text":"officially according to the clock."},"3018":{"dur":4,"text":"But the holidays are right around the\ncorner, and I've read that you are known"},"3022":{"dur":4,"text":"for

are, I promise you,"},"3067":{"dur":4,"text":"you will laugh really hard and\nyou will walk away happier, and"},"3072":{"dur":6,"text":"with a sense of some, the world being\na place where we can all

is,"},"3082":{"dur":5,"text":"look, having a meaningful life\nis what you should be going for."},"3088":{"dur":1,"text":"That is what will make you happy."},"3090":{"dur":4,"text":"If you sit there

to say it's not selfish."},"3108":{"dur":4,"text":"But that's what, I promise you guys,\nif you're doing that,"},"3112":{"dur":4,"text":"you will find great joy in that, and\nthat's what I've observed
