Commons?"},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"Yay!\nSome."},"391":{"dur":3,"text":"So um-\nI actually have to go back to this-"},"394":{"dur":5,"text":"so um, in 1980"},"400":{"dur":3,"text":"there was a

destruction"},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"so if there was a nuclear war"},"428":{"dur":3,"text":"um, everyone would had been killed."},"432":{"dur":5,"text":"And the women\nthat surrounded the area"},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"decided that they were\ngoing to protest"},"439":{"dur":3,"text":"this take over of their commons."},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"And hundreds of thousands of women"},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"descended upon\nthe Greenham Commons"},"447":{"dur":3,"text":"and the erected base camps\naround the periphery"},"451":{"dur":3,"text":"of the um, commons."},"454":{"dur":3,"text":"Nine different ones where they could\nwatch exactly what happened"},"458":{"dur":6,"text":"and they could see when\ntruckloads full of machinery came in."},"465":{"dur":3,"text":"And they tried to disrupt\nas much as possible"},"468":{"dur":4,"text":"of the smooth running\nof that um, detail."},"472":{"dur":3,"text":"One other really specific thing\nabout Greenham Commons"},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"is that they saw creative making"},"478":{"dur":3,"text":"as a opposition to violence."},"481":{"dur":4,"text":"And so there was this\nethos of creative direct action"},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"that was just mythic"},"487":{"dur":3,"text":"in regards to the actions of\nthose women carried out."},"491":{"dur":5,"text":"Um, they did a lot of\nvarious performative acts"},"496":{"dur":6,"text":"um, they came up with an entire\nsongbook of songs and chants,"},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"and they created objects"},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"that they wove into\nthe barbed wire fence"},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"around the- the commons."},"513":{"dur":4,"text":"Um, another thing that they did\nis they knit sweaters"},"517":{"dur":3,"text":"that the more I did\nresearch of the camps"},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"the more I saw\nwere pretty ubiquitous."},"523":{"dur":3,"text":"If you're talking about a population\nof people that were living outside"},"526":{"dur":1,"text":"sometimes for years at a time"},"528":{"dur":5,"text":"in um tents that were ripped down\ntypically every single week,"},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"the importance of warmth"},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"is not to be understated."},"538":{"dur":3,"text":"And knitwear for sure, if you know,"},"541":{"dur":3,"text":"has lanolin in it,\nwhich is a natural water repellent."},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was the 80s\nand it was England,"},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"and there were a lot\nof knitters on site,"},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"and they started knitting sweaters"},"552":{"dur":3,"text":"that had um, protest imagery,"},"555":{"dur":3,"text":"and symbolism, and words\nknit into their garments."},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"And I started researching these"},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"and this was the beginning\nof me doing these paintings"},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"that I am presenting\nto you tonight."},"567":{"dur":4,"text":"Um, so if you look\nat this image"},"571":{"dur":5,"text":"which is some campers that had just\nbroken through the barbed wire fence"},"576":{"dur":5,"text":"and they were running\ntowards the military outpost"},"582":{"dur":4,"text":"with a snake um,\nthat they had made"},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"out of all these\nsheets sewn together."},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"You see that there are various women\nthat are running with sweaters,"},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"and one of them on the right\nin the foreground"},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"has this sweater that\nlooks like there's a sunrise on it."},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"Um, and in the back,\non the left,"},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"there's a woman\nkind of further down"},"602":{"dur":4,"text":"has a brown sweater that\nhas um, symbols on it as well,"},"606":{"dur":5,"text":"that could be- could be seen to be\na women's symbol or fists symbol."},"612":{"dur":4,"text":"Um, so I've been a knitter\nsince I was twenty,"},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"um, maybe earlier than that."},"618":{"dur":3,"text":"Um, professionally\nI've been a knitter,"},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"I've worked for Vogue Knitting Magazine\nin New York,"},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"I've proofed patterns for years,"},"626":{"dur":6,"text":"I've been um, like a production knitter\nfor various people,"},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's a vocabulary of knitting"},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"that I am very,\nvery familiar with."},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"And what I decided to do"},"640":{"dur":2,"text":"is to create a series of paintings"},"642":{"dur":7,"text":"that were the- I guess the um,\npresentation of the garment"},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"but in a way where all of\nthe pieces of the garment"},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"were um, flattened\non top of each other."},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you look at this piece here"},"661":{"dur":4,"text":"you can see that there's a sleeve,\nand there's a sleeve,"},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"and there's a front piece,\nand there's a back piece"},"668":{"dur":3,"text":"and there's two plaquettes\nfor where the buttons would be on a cardigan."},"672":{"dur":3,"text":"Um, but they're all laid\non top of each other,"},"675":{"dur":3,"text":"and so um, this is what\nit looks like up close."},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"There's a grid that\nthey are painted on top of"},"682":{"dur":4,"text":"and the grid is not confirmative\nto a typical kind of geometric square grid."},"687":{"dur":5,"text":"Instead it's a grid that ca-\nconforms to the gauge of yarn"},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"and so it's an imperfect grid,"},"694":{"dur":4,"text":"it's flatter than a regular grid."},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"And then my other intention\nfor this body of work"},"702":{"dur":4,"text":"was that because\nthe paintings are also patterns"},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"in the sense that\nthey can be followed."},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"They're these generative things"},"712":{"dur":4,"text":"that a person could um,\nrecreate objects from,"},"716":{"dur":3,"text":"if a person desired\nto do that."},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"And so in the beginning especially"},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"I would knit as many\nof the paintings as I possibly could,"},"725":{"dur":4,"text":"so they would be shown\nas the painting and also the garment together."},"730":{"dur":4,"text":"And I thought of them\nas being this way"},"734":{"dur":5,"text":"to pull intention\nand pull um, engagement"},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"out of the past\nand into the present."},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"And so um, this is my..."},"749":{"dur":3,"text":"I guess translation of\nthat sweater that you saw in the image,"},"752":{"dur":1,"text":"the brown sweater\nthat was in the back."},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"And so for years,\nand I continue to do so,"},"758":{"dur":4,"text":"for years I've been just\ntrying to find as many instances"},"762":{"dur":1,"text":"of Greenham Common campers"},"764":{"dur":3,"text":"that are wearing these sweaters\nthat are arguing ideologies."},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"Umm, so you can\nsee this a woman-"},"769":{"dur":2,"text":"this is from\na video clip that I found"},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"um, of Christmas in 1983"},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"in Greenham where\na woman is washing dishes."},"778":{"dur":3,"text":"And she's wearing this yellow sweater\nthat has these yellow hearts on the back."},"781":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is an example of something\nthat I feel is argumentative,"},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"even in the most\ngentle terms"},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"it's argumentative for love"},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"because it has the hearts."},"791":{"dur":4,"text":"And so that passes the muster\nfor my decision making,"},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"and then it goes on\nto become a painting."},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"And then back then"},"799":{"dur":1,"text":"this was the-\nwhen was this?"},"800":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe 19-\noh- 2008?"},"803":{"dur":3,"text":"I was still had time to actually\nknit all the sweaters as well."},"807":{"dur":1,"text":"Um, and we'll get to that later,"},"808":{"dur":2,"text":"there's a way, like I said,\nthat when I knit the sweaters"},"811":{"dur":3,"text":"I felt like there was this way\nof bringing them present"},"814":{"dur":1,"text":"and having them activated"},"815":{"dur":3,"text":"um, which did not\nactually come to fore."},"818":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, people would\nmaybe buy work with the sweater"},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"and then it would maybe\nget displayed on someone's wall,"},"824":{"dur":1,"text":"or maybe go into storage."},"826":{"dur":4,"text":"But there was a way that the sweater\ndidn't have um, an energy-"},"830":{"dur":3,"text":"an energetic reactivation\nthe way that I had intended."},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"So I will addre-\nI am addressing this presently"},"837":{"dur":1,"text":"and will talk about it in a little bit."},"839":{"dur":1,"text":"Um-"},"844":{"dur":3,"text":"here's another example of\na Greenham Commons camper"},"847":{"dur":5,"text":"um, wearing a sweater that is um,\nhas a god's eye pattern on it."},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"And then this is the painting\nthat was made from that"},"857":{"dur":4,"text":"so you can see that\nthey've also changed, become larger,"},"861":{"dur":4,"text":"they are more of\na figurative presence now,"},"866":{"dur":2,"text":"I believe I like that\nthey have a full body to them,"},"869":{"dur":3,"text":"they read to my eye\nas an alternate"},"872":{"dur":2,"text":"kind of representation\nof the female body."},"874":{"dur":5,"text":"And it's a representation\nthat is upon a matrix"},"880":{"dur":5,"text":"that I can believe is-\nis a feminine matrix,"},"885":{"dur":2,"text":"it kind of exists\nas a representation of women"},"888":{"dur":1,"text":"outside of a standardized art history,"},"890":{"dur":2,"text":"especially of painting-\npainting art history"},"892":{"dur":2,"text":"um, of representation of women."},"897":{"dur":2,"text":"Here is another example of an image."},"899":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is- this woman that's\nkneeling in the lower right"},"903":{"dur":4,"text":"she's wearing this sweater\nthat has a fringe at some point,"},"907":{"dur":3,"text":"and also the very bottom\nit says 'S.O.S' on it"},"910":{"dur":1,"text":"if you get in there close\nand look at it."},"912":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is the painting\nthat was recreated from that one."},"916":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's an ongoing process"},"920":{"dur":2,"text":"for me to find these images,"},"922":{"dur":1,"text":"and then to recreate them."},"924":{"dur":4,"text":"I spent January of last year"},"928":{"dur":3,"text":"going to the Women's Library"},"932":{"dur":2,"text":"at the London School of Economics,"},"934":{"dur":4,"text":"where there's a partial archive\nof Greenham Commons' ephemera,"},"939":{"dur":1,"text":"including a lot of photographs."},"940":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's a few in England,"},"944":{"dur":2,"text":"there's one in Manchester\nat a People's History Museum"},"947":{"dur":1,"text":"that I haven't been to yet,"},"948":{"dur":5,"text":"but I have been um-\nthey have said that I'm allowed to go there"},"953":{"dur":2,"text":"and just comb through\nboxes of photographs,"},"955":{"dur":1,"text":"so I will be doing that soon."},"957":{"dur":1,"text":"But I think it's important to say"},"959":{"dur":4,"text":"that my intention\nin revisiting this subject"},"963":{"dur":4,"text":"and other subjects,\nas we get deeper into this talk,"},"967":{"dur":4,"text":"is to bring things out of history"},"971":{"dur":3,"text":"that may have,\nnot been over looked,"},"974":{"dur":3,"text":"but just to bring things out\nthat people don't know about,"},"978":{"dur":2,"text":"and that I didn't know about."},"980":{"dur":6,"text":"And to pay respect,\nand to show people honor."},"986":{"dur":3,"text":"And so um, like I said,\nI will continue to try to find"},"990":{"dur":2,"text":"sources of Greenham Commons campers,"},"992":{"dur":2,"text":"it's hard to do when you're not in England."},"995":{"dur":2,"text":"There used to be an archive online"},"997":{"dur":2,"text":"that went down two years ago,"},"1000":{"dur":2,"text":"so it's gotten harder\nand not easier."},"1002":{"dur":1,"text":"I feel like I've probably\ncombed the web"},"1003":{"dur":2,"text":"for every single image\nand video that exists."},"1006":{"dur":2,"text":"If anyone ever comes\nacross another one,"},"1009":{"dur":2,"text":"please send it my way."},"1013":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is the painting\nthat was created out of this."},"1017":{"dur":1,"text":"So another thing\nthat is starting to happen"},"1018":{"dur":3,"text":"is that in order to\nfit onto this page"},"1022":{"dur":2,"text":"it's kind of the page\nthat the paper comes in,"},"1024":{"dur":2,"text":"it's printmaking paper,"},"1026":{"dur":3,"text":"it's 42 by 30 inches,"},"1029":{"dur":1,"text":"and I tea stain it,"},"1030":{"dur":2,"text":"which is probably\nthe first thing I should've said."},"1033":{"dur":2,"text":"I tea stain it\nto get that brown color,"},"1035":{"dur":2,"text":"and I do that because-"},"1038":{"dur":1,"text":"well I guess a couple of reasons,"},"1040":{"dur":3,"text":"one reason is because\nit feels to me"},"1043":{"dur":3,"text":"like the way old pattern\nsheeting looks like"},"1046":{"dur":1,"text":"like when you buy\na sewing pattern,"},"1048":{"dur":1,"text":"that kind of particular color."},"1049":{"dur":2,"text":"But also because just\na strictly formal reason,"},"1052":{"dur":2,"text":"a white paint doesn't\nshow up on white paper"},"1054":{"dur":0,"text":"in the way that I like,"},"1055":{"dur":1,"text":"so those are the two reasons."},"1057":{"dur":2,"text":"But because it is that size,"},"1059":{"dur":4,"text":"in order to fit garments\nthat I'm trying to knit"},"1064":{"dur":1,"text":"on that size of paper"},"1065":{"dur":2,"text":"things start-\nstart to have to be folded."},"1068":{"dur":3,"text":"Um, so the skirt that\nshe's wearing in this picture"},"1072":{"dur":3,"text":"needs to be folded up\nfrom the bottom,"},"1075":{"dur":1,"text":"and then also in on itself."},"1076":{"dur":4,"text":"So forms become-\nthey kind of-"},"1081":{"dur":1,"text":"they- they become dense"},"1082":{"dur":3,"text":"and there's this illusion of transparency"},"1086":{"dur":1,"text":"that has to be maintained"},"1087":{"dur":1,"text":"so that that I look like-\nit feels like"},"1088":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm looking through\none um, plane"},"1093":{"dur":2,"text":"into the next plane\nonto the next plane."},"1095":{"dur":2,"text":"And so a sweater painting like this"},"1097":{"dur":1,"text":"is especially
