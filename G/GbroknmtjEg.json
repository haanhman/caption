is"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"definitely true of the early sociobiology, but"},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"we're really moving away from that now,"},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"so I think that's not so much of a

basically derived"},"950":{"dur":3,"text":"from optimal foraging theory, and a speci-, well"},"954":{"dur":2,"text":"and here he uses a specific prey choice model,"},"956":{"dur":3,"text":"which assumes that organisms need to acquire"},"960":{"dur":3,"text":"food to reproduce, to, you know, reproduce"},"964":{"dur":2,"text":"and produce babies, and obtain fitness."},"967":{"dur":3,"text":"Obviously it's not linear, and also that foraging"},"971":{"dur":2,"text":"behavior incurs opportunity costs, so that there"},"973":{"dur":1,"text":"are, you know, you don't want to spend all"},"975":{"dur":2,"text":"your time out hunting, because there's other"},"977":{"dur":2,"text":"things to do, so the optimal strategy would"},"979":{"dur":2,"text":"be to hunt, choose your prey as efficiently"},"982":{"dur":2,"text":"as possible in a certain amount of time."},"984":{"dur":2,"text":"So the hypothesis there is that forager

assumption here,"},"996":{"dur":2,"text":"and that is that your harvesting does"},"998":{"dur":3,"text":"not affect the regeneration of the prey."},"1002":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, so against this he pits the conservation"},"1005":{"dur":3,"text":"hypothesis, is that foragers' choices are"},"1008":{"dur":2,"text":"influenced by the effect they have on the"},"1010":{"dur":3,"text":"regeneration of the prey, and that they minimize"},"1014":{"dur":1,"text":"and that they're therefore their prey choices"},"1016":{"dur":2,"text":"minimize the effects on the reproductive rate

the moment because of being able,"},"1503":{"dur":2,"text":"expecting to be able to take it in the future."},"1506":{"dur":4,"text":"And these are, the property rights issue is"},"1510":{"dur":2,"text":"actually going to sort of come up again, be, really"},"1513":{"dur":2,"text":"is explored more with the concept of cooperation"},"1516":{"dur":3,"text":"that I'll get onto closer to the end of the talk."},"1519":{"dur":2,"text":"So with respect to the intrinsic character of"},"1522":{"dur":2,"text":"the resource, and the question

single"},"1549":{"dur":2,"text":"example, just look at the guy on the right."},"1552":{"dur":4,"text":"So a way of thinking about this is if a predator,"},"1556":{"dur":2,"text":"let's say a bushback

controversial example, and"},"1583":{"dur":1,"text":"one that maybe we'll want to discuss more"},"1584":{"dur":3,"text":"in the question time, is that, is this question"},"1587":{"dur":2,"text":"of why do pastoralists keep such big herds?"},"1590":{"dur":2,"text":"Ecologists have often argued that pastoralists"},"1593":{"dur":2,"text":"keep herds at unsustainable levels and

just don't produce anything visual, and"},"1621":{"dur":2,"text":"so it's kind of hard to see, but what you can see"},"1624":{"dur":3,"text":"here from my little shot here of the blackboard,"},"1628":{"dur":4,"text":"the whiteboard is that cattle mortality is almost,"},"1632":{"dur":3,"text":"is hardly sensitive at all to population density."},"1635":{"dur":3,"text":"In single year droughts, there's slightly higher"},"1639":{"dur":3,"text":"mortality in areas with high population density,"},"1642":{"dur":3,"text":"but in multi-year droughts, there's really cattle"},"1645":{"dur":3,"text":"die irrespective of population density, and this is"},"1649":{"dur":5,"text":"of course the same for disease and the same for"},"1654":{"dur":4,"text":"mortality or loss from raiding, so the point here is"},"1659":{"dur":3,"text":"that it just doesn't make sense to reduce your cattle"},"1662":{"dur":4,"text":"holdings because the mortality, or the loss of your"},"1666":{"dur":2,"text":"cattle is not dependent on how many you have."},"1669":{"dur":2,"text":"And so under these kinds of circumstances,"},"1671":{"dur":2,"text":"you wouldn't expect conservation to arise."},"1673":{"dur":1,"text":"So, oh dear."},"1675":{"dur":3,"text":"So the more general argument that is"},"1679":{"dur":3,"text":"developed from this kind of insight is"},"1682":{"dur":2,"text":"that stochastic environments will favor"},"1684":{"dur":2,"text":"opportunistic strategies, whereas systems that"},"1687":{"dur":4,"text":"are closer to equilibrium will favor restraint."},"1691":{"dur":3,"text":"Now this kind of seems like an interesting"},"1694":{"dur":3,"text":"prediction, but as yet I really don't know"},"1698":{"dur":3,"text":"much data, at least in human harvesting, to"},"1701":{"dur":2,"text":"actually assess this prediction, and what I do"},"1704":{"dur":2,"text":"know actually goes the other way, I'm afraid."},"1707":{"dur":2,"text":"So a study by Chapman, a long time ago, in the"},"1710":{"dur":2,"text":"1980s, I think, looked at the evidence of kind of"},"1713":{"dur":3,"text":"conservation taboos and environmental protection,"},"1716":{"dur":3,"text":"the protection across different Pacific atolls, and he"},"1720":{"dur":2,"text":"found that you actually get much more concern"},"1723":{"dur":2,"text":"with protecting the environment in the atolls"},"1725":{"dur":2,"text":"that are most frequently hit by hurricanes."},"1728":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, if you think back to this
