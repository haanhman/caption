here."},"399":{"dur":1,"text":"So you can have a square."},"400":{"dur":5,"text":"Or you can have a scrolling\nhoop, I suppose you'd say."},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"So they've got some really\nnice

what"},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm talking about."},"437":{"dur":0,"text":"Beautiful."},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"So what you can see, first off,\nthey've implemented a"},"440":{"dur":3,"text":"really excellent breaking\nnews notification."},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"This doesn't trigger too often\nfor me, maybe two,"},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"three times a day max."},"449":{"dur":0,"text":"So it's not

pop up."},"455":{"dur":4,"text":"And it does remind me of\nbreaking news as it happens."},"459":{"dur":1,"text":"And then the actual\nimplementation of the"},"461":{"dur":3,"text":"notification is really,\nreally good."},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a rich notification\nstraight off."},"466":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's got an image."},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"It has a generous snippet of\nnews, so I can actually read"},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"what that breaking news headline\nis, and not just the"},"472":{"dur":3,"text":"headline, but actually the\narticle lead to know whether"},"476":{"dur":3,"text":"it's something which I\nwant to read further."},"480":{"dur":3,"text":"And what they've done really\nwell to get that bonus point"},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"is that they've actually let me\ninteract with it directly"},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"from the notification."},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can see I can share\ndirectly from here,

here."},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"They really encourage users\nto signal the mood"},"501":{"dur":1,"text":"evoked by each article."},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"And they let me do this without\nhaving to log

persistent\nacross devices and logins."},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"But without having to do\nanything, I can straight away"},"515":{"dur":2,"text":"start to interact and tell\nthem what my mood is."},"517":{"dur":1,"text":"And why is this important?"},"519":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, this lets them, then,\ncustomize the things which I"},"522":{"dur":0,"text":"want to hear about."},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"So my breaking news\nnotifications, even the news"},"525":{"dur":3,"text":"feed itself, can all be\noptimized around the articles"},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"which I interact with."},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"In particular, it gives you\nan idea of what kind of an"},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"article it is, whether people\nare surprised, angry, sad,"},"536":{"dur":3,"text":"happy, which is useful\nin and of itself."},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"But apart from that, it's just\na signal that people are"},"542":{"dur":1,"text":"interested enough in a\nparticular article"},"543":{"dur":1,"text":"to engage with it."},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"So that gives them really useful\nanalytics that they can"},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"use for a number of\ndifferent things."},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, they can use that feedback\nto either choose"},"554":{"dur":1,"text":"which notifications\nI'm using or to"},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"customize the feed directly."},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, overall, I think News\nRepublic have done these"},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"things really, really well."},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"There's really little jank."},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"I really seldom find myself\nwaiting for images or articles"},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"to download."},"567":{"dur":3,"text":"And the UI offers some really\nunique features, such as their"},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"subject cloud, without deviating\ntoo far from the"},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"standard UI guidelines."},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"I never feel like I'm lost\nwithin the app, unsure of how"},"577":{"dur":1,"text":"to do something or how\nto get somewhere."},"579":{"dur":3,"text":"It's all where I expect it to\nbe with the occasional happy"},"582":{"dur":1,"text":"surprise of something I\nwasn't expecting but"},"584":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm happy to see."},"585":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, there are a couple of areas\nwhere I'd like to see"},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"them adhere a little more\nclosely to the UI guide."},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"And in particular, it's\nreally centered"},"593":{"dur":1,"text":"around the action bar."},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"So you can see here that they've\ncreated their own"},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"action bar implementation,\nwhich is totally fine and"},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"understandable if you want to\nhave backwards compatibility"},"600":{"dur":3,"text":"and not have to have too many\ndifferent versions of the app."},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"But some of their choices are\na little bit jarring to an"},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"experienced Android user."},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"So in particular, the overflow\nmenu is pretty nonstandard."},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can see here, the size\nof each menu item is"},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"slightly too large."},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"Separator lines are\na little too dark."},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"And all the text is\nright-aligned, which is off."},"621":{"dur":3,"text":"And they've added icons, which\nis really nonstandard."},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's nothing particularly\nwrong about the"},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"way this looks except that\nit doesn't look the"},"629":{"dur":1,"text":"way I expect it to."},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"So when I hit it, it creates\nthis cognitive dissonance"},"633":{"dur":3,"text":"moment of, OK, this isn't\nwhat I was expecting."},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"And so whenever you're\nsurprising your users with"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"something that they're not\nexpecting, that can break them"},"642":{"dur":3,"text":"out of their engagement,\nmake them second"},"645":{"dur":1,"text":"guess themselves, almost."},"646":{"dur":1,"text":"It's like, oh, did I\ndo something wrong?"},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"I was expecting this to happen\nand something else did."},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"You want to avoid those\ncircumstances where you're"},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"forcing users to question their\nown behavior as that's"},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"going to make them less\nconfident, make them less"},"657":{"dur":1,"text":"willing to explore your\napp and find some"},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"of the hidden gems."},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"And in fact, it goes that little\none step further within"},"665":{"dur":0,"text":"the action bar itself."},"666":{"dur":3,"text":"You can see that once you go\nbeyond the menu to the actual"},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"action bar icons, in particular\nthe mood and share"},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"icons, they're also a\nlittle non-standard."},"675":{"dur":1,"text":"They're a bit too dark."},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"The overflow menu item itself\nlooks a lot like the standard"},"680":{"dur":1,"text":"overflow menu but\nisn't quite it."},"681":{"dur":1,"text":"It's too dark."},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"The dots are slightly too big."},"685":{"dur":3,"text":"So again, we're talking really\nslight variation, but just"},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"enough to be a little\nbit disconcerting."},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's fair to say\nthat all this"},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"has been pretty nit-picky."},"693":{"dur":3,"text":"But it's small details like this\nthat are like having sand"},"697":{"dur":1,"text":"in your bathers."},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"It's small, but constantly\nirritating."},"701":{"dur":3,"text":"So it would be great to see\nthe team, perhaps, work on"},"704":{"dur":0,"text":"those things."},"705":{"dur":1,"text":"But overall, a really\nfantastic app."},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"Like I said, I go to a\nnews app every day."},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm a big fan."},"712":{"dur":3,"text":"Now The Verge, as opposed to\nNews Republic, which is a"},"715":{"dur":3,"text":"content aggregator, The Verge\nis a single-source news app"},"718":{"dur":1,"text":"that effectively wraps\na popular tech"},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"news site, The Verge."},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"And we figured that The Verge\nspends enough time talking"},"724":{"dur":1,"text":"about us that it might\nbe fun to talk a"},"726":{"dur":1,"text":"little bit about them."},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"So we'll start off with their\nlanding page, which is great."},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"It's got a distinctive logo\nwhich everyone recognizes."},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"And its feature graphic\nis really stand out."},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"Now personally, I think they may\nhave overdone the

here."},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"I'd think about making that\na little more opaque and a"},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"little bit bigger, just so that\nwhen we shrink it down to"},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"some of the smaller feature\nslots on a phone, it's still"},"751":{"dur":1,"text":"legible and recognizable."},"755":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, single-source apps tend\nto be a bit of a mixed

is."},"775":{"dur":1,"text":"But it's just not going to give\nthem a great experience."},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"And you got to remember that\nyour app, your Android app,"},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"your mobile app, is a\nrepresentation of your"},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"website, of your brand,\nmore importantly."},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you're going to go to the\neffort of building an
