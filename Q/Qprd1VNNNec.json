It's happening right now."},"68":{"dur":2,"text":"The reason that you can see me standing here is because"},"70":{"dur":3,"text":"this room is filled with more than 100 quintillion photons,"},"74":{"dur":3,"text":"and they're moving randomly through the space, near the speed of light."},"78":{"dur":1,"text":"All of them are different colors,"},"79":{"dur":1,"text":"they're rippling with different frequencies,"},"81":{"dur":2,"text":"and they're bouncing off every surface, including me,"},"84":{"dur":2,"text":"and some of those are flying directly into your eyes,"},"86":{"dur":3,"text":"and that's why your brain is forming an image of me standing here."},"90":{"dur":1,"text":"Now a laser is different."},"91":{"dur":4,"text":"It also uses photons, but they're all synchronized,"},"95":{"dur":2,"text":"and if you focus them into a beam,"},"98":{"dur":2,"text":"what you have is an incredibly useful tool."},"100":{"dur":2,"text":"The control of a laser is so precise"},"103":{"dur":2,"text":"that you can perform surgery inside of an eye,"},"105":{"dur":2,"text":"you can use it to store massive amounts of data,"},"108":{"dur":2,"text":"and you can use it for this beautiful experiment"},"110":{"dur":2,"text":"that my friend was struggling to explain."},"113":{"dur":3,"text":"First you trap atoms in a special bottle."},"116":{"dur":2,"text":"It uses electromagnetic fields to isolate the atoms"},"119":{"dur":2,"text":"from the noise of the environment."},"121":{"dur":2,"text":"And the atoms themselves are quite violent,"},"124":{"dur":4,"text":"but if you fire lasers that are precisely tuned to the right frequency,"},"128":{"dur":2,"text":"an atom will briefly absorb those

zero."},"140":{"dur":3,"text":"Now if you use the right kind of atoms and you get them cold enough,"},"143":{"dur":3,"text":"something truly bizarre happens."},"147":{"dur":2,"text":"It's no longer a solid, a liquid or a gas."},"150":{"dur":3,"text":"It enters a new state of matter called a superfluid."},"154":{"dur":2,"text":"The atoms lose their individual identity,"},"156":{"dur":2,"text":"and the rules from the quantum world take over,"},"159":{"dur":4,"text":"and that's what gives superfluids such spooky properties."},"163":{"dur":3,"text":"For example, if you shine light through a superfluid,"},"166":{"dur":3,"text":"it is able to slow photons down"},"169":{"dur":3,"text":"to 60 kilometers per hour."},"179":{"dur":3,"text":"Another spooky property is that it

defeat of our intuition through experimentation."},"215":{"dur":1,"text":"But the experiment is not the end of the story,"},"217":{"dur":3,"text":"because you still have to transmit that knowledge to other people."},"220":{"dur":2,"text":"I have a Ph.D in molecular biology."},"223":{"dur":3,"text":"I still barely understand what most scientists are talking about."},"226":{"dur":2,"text":"So as my friend was trying to explain that experiment,"},"229":{"dur":2,"text":"it seemed like the more he said,"},"232":{"dur":2,"text":"the less I understood."},"235":{"dur":2,"text":"Because if you're

better."},"245":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, the ideal may be to use no words at all."},"248":{"dur":1,"text":"I remember thinking, my friend could have explained"},"250":{"dur":3,"text":"that entire experiment with a dance."},"253":{"dur":4,"text":"Of course, there never seem to be any dancers around when you need them."},"257":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, the idea is not as crazy as it sounds."},"259":{"dur":3,"text":"I started a contest four years ago called Dance Your Ph.D."},"263":{"dur":2,"text":"Instead of explaining their research with words,"},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"scientists have to explain it with dance."},"268":{"dur":2,"text":"Now surprisingly, it seems to work."},"271":{"dur":3,"text":"Dance really can make science easier to

dancing scientists waiting for you."},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"The most surprising thing that I've learned while running this contest"},"284":{"dur":5,"text":"is that some scientists are now working directly with dancers on their research."},"289":{"dur":1,"text":"For example, at the University of Minnesota,"},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"there's a biomedical engineer named David Odde,"},"294":{"dur":3,"text":"and he works with dancers to study how cells move."},"297":{"dur":2,"text":"They do it by changing their shape."},"299":{"dur":2,"text":"When a chemical signal washes up on one side,"},"302":{"dur":3,"text":"it triggers the cell to expand its shape on that side,"},"305":{"dur":3,"text":"because the cell is constantly touching and tugging at the environment."},"309":{"dur":3,"text":"So that allows cells to ooze along in the right directions."},"312":{"dur":3,"text":"But what seems so slow and graceful from the outside"},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"is really more like chaos inside,"},"319":{"dur":4,"text":"because cells control their shape with a skeleton of rigid protein fibers,"},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"and those fibers are constantly falling apart."},"326":{"dur":2,"text":"But just as quickly as they explode,"},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"more proteins attach to the ends and grow them longer,"},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"so it's constantly changing"},"333":{"dur":2,"text":"just to remain exactly the same."},"336":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, David builds mathematical models of this and then he tests those in the lab,"},"339":{"dur":2,"text":"but before he does that, he works with dancers"},"342":{"dur":3,"text":"to figure out what kinds of models to build in the first place."},"346":{"dur":3,"text":"It's basically efficient brainstorming,"},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"and when I visited David to learn about his research,"},"351":{"dur":3,"text":"he used dancers to explain it to me"},"355":{"dur":4,"text":"rather than the usual method: PowerPoint."},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"And this brings me to my modest proposal."},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that bad PowerPoint presentations"},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"are a serious threat to the global economy."},"367":{"dur":7,"text":"(Laughter) (Applause)"},"375":{"dur":4,"text":"Now it does depend on how you measure it, of course,"},"380":{"dur":4,"text":"but one estimate has put the drain at 250 million dollars per day."},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"Now that assumes half-hour presentations"},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"for an average audience of four people"},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"with salaries of 35,000 dollars,"},"391":{"dur":1,"text":"and it conservatively assumes that"},"393":{"dur":3,"text":"about a quarter of the presentations are a complete waste of time,"},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"and given that there are some apparently"},"400":{"dur":3,"text":"30 million PowerPoint presentations created every day,"},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"that would indeed add up to an annual waste"},"406":{"dur":3,"text":"of 100 billion dollars."},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"Of course, that's just the time we're losing"},"411":{"dur":2,"text":"sitting through presentations."},"413":{"dur":4,"text":"There are other costs, because PowerPoint is a tool,"},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"and like any tool, it can and will be abused."},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"To borrow a concept from my country's CIA,"},"424":{"dur":3,"text":"it helps you to soften up your audience."},"427":{"dur":4,"text":"It distracts them with pretty pictures, irrelevant data."},"431":{"dur":3,"text":"It allows you to create the illusion of competence,"},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"the illusion of simplicity,"},"437":{"dur":4,"text":"and most destructively, the illusion of understanding."},"442":{"dur":4,"text":"So now my country is 15 trillion dollars in debt."},"446":{"dur":4,"text":"Our leaders are working tirelessly to try and find ways to save money."},"451":{"dur":4,"text":"One idea is to drastically reduce public support for the arts."},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"For example, our National Endowment for the Arts,"},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"with its $150 million budget,"},"461":{"dur":3,"text":"slashing that program would immediately reduce the national debt"},"464":{"dur":3,"text":"by about one one-thousandth of a percent."},"467":{"dur":1,"text":"One certainly can't argue with those numbers."},"469":{"dur":5,"text":"However, once we eliminate public funding for the arts,"},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"there will be some drawbacks."},"477":{"dur":4,"text":"The artists on the street will swell the ranks of the unemployed."},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"Many will turn to drug abuse and prostitution,"},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"and that will inevitably lower property values in urban neighborhoods."},"487":{"dur":4,"text":"All of this could wipe out the savings we're hoping to make in the first place."},"492":{"dur":3,"text":"I shall now, therefore, humbly propose my own thoughts,"},"495":{"dur":3,"text":"which I hope will not be liable to the least objection."},"499":{"dur":1,"text":"Once we eliminate public funding for the artists,"},"501":{"dur":1,"text":"let's put them back to work"},"502":{"dur":3,"text":"by using them instead of PowerPoint."},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"As a test case, I propose we start with American dancers."},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"After all, they are the most perishable of their kind,"},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"prone to injury and very slow to heal"},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"due to our health care system."},"516":{"dur":3,"text":"Rather than dancing our Ph.Ds,"},"519":{"dur":3,"text":"we should use dance to explain all of our complex problems."},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"Imagine our politicians using dance"},"525":{"dur":3,"text":"to explain why we must invade a foreign country"},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"or bail out an investment bank."},"532":{"dur":1,"text":"It's sure to help."},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"Of course someday, in the deep future,"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"a technology of persuasion"},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"even more powerful than PowerPoint may be invented,"},"544":{"dur":3,"text":"rendering dancers unnecessary as tools of rhetoric."},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"However, I trust that by that day,"},"550":{"dur":3,"text":"we shall have passed this present financial calamity."},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"Perhaps by then we will be able to afford the luxury"},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"of just sitting in an audience"},"559":{"dur":1,"text":"with no other purpose"},"561":{"dur":4,"text":"than to witness the human form in motion."},"566":{"dur":70,"text":"(Music)"},"637":{"dur":29,"text":"(Applause)"}}
