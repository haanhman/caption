Christina:"},"901":{"dur":8,"text":"I have to agree with you because even in my\nwork about boys in school, what I saw continuously"},"910":{"dur":9,"text":"is that there's a cohort of boys who probably\nwould've been okay in previous decades because"},"919":{"dur":6,"text":"there was a time where you could graduate\nfrom high school, get a job at the local factory"},"925":{"dur":7,"text":"or something and make it into the middle class.\nThat is increasingly difficult.

Brad:"},"1001":{"dur":3,"text":"Right, right. That's a great point. I think\nDavid Autor has made this point as well.
