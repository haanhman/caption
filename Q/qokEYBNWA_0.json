opportunity."},"176":{"dur":2,"text":"So we want to make developers\nmuch more productive."},"178":{"dur":2,"text":"And so in the third\npart I'll talk"},"181":{"dur":2,"text":"about how we are\ngoing to do that."},"184":{"dur":3,"text":"Today we're announcing new\nfunctionality, new pricing,"},"187":{"dur":4,"text":"that will help you developers\nbe more productive, more"},"191":{"dur":4,"text":"economical, and hopefully\nhave more fun while you do it."},"196":{"dur":4,"text":"So first, let's look at a few\nhighlights from last year."},"201":{"dur":2,"text":"12 months ago-- it's\nactually hard to think back"},"203":{"dur":3,"text":"12 months ago because our world\nwas so much different back"},"207":{"dur":2,"text":"then, and we changed\nso much since then."},"209":{"dur":4,"text":"So obviously at I\/O last\nMay, here in San Francisco,"},"213":{"dur":2,"text":"we introduced Compute\nEngine, so the ability"},"216":{"dur":3,"text":"to run VMs in\nGoogle data centers."},"219":{"dur":3,"text":"And we introduced them\nwith a few cool features,"},"223":{"dur":3,"text":"such as large consistent\ndisks and per minute billing,"},"226":{"dur":3,"text":"so you only pay for the\nminutes that you actually use."},"230":{"dur":3,"text":"We also introduce that at the\nsame time, PHP for App Engine."},"233":{"dur":4,"text":"PHP, obviously, one of the\nmost popular languages, and PHP"},"237":{"dur":3,"text":"for App Engine having been one\nof the most popular features"},"241":{"dur":2,"text":"of all time-- feature\nrequests of all time."},"243":{"dur":3,"text":"Then in August, we showed\nyou Layer 3 load balancing."},"247":{"dur":2,"text":"And you might\nremember, in November"},"249":{"dur":2,"text":"when we demoed it,\nthat it can reach"},"252":{"dur":4,"text":"a million requests per\nsecond, from a cold start,"},"257":{"dur":3,"text":"in five seconds with no need\nto preprovision or warm up"},"260":{"dur":1,"text":"anything."},"262":{"dur":3,"text":"So even a 1.0 product,\nlike load balancing,"},"265":{"dur":3,"text":"is actually pretty\nmature and pretty stable."},"269":{"dur":2,"text":"And the reason for that is that\nit's based on the same code"},"272":{"dur":3,"text":"base that powers load\nbalancing for Google.com."},"275":{"dur":3,"text":"You're going to see that a\nlot from our infrastructure."},"279":{"dur":3,"text":"Then in December, we\nput Compute Engine"},"282":{"dur":5,"text":"into GA-- General Availability--\nand introduced a few more"},"288":{"dur":3,"text":"new features there that\nI'll talk about in a minute."},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"On the data side,\nwe also did a lot."},"294":{"dur":4,"text":"We introduced Cloud Datastore,\nour fully managed, NoSQL data"},"299":{"dur":3,"text":"store that scales to pretty much\nanything you can throw at it."},"303":{"dur":2,"text":"Based on our very own BigTable,\nthe system that actually"},"305":{"dur":5,"text":"started the NoSQL revolution,\nwe have offline disk import,"},"311":{"dur":3,"text":"encryption at rest, native\nconnections for Cloud SQL."},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"So one example of where\nwe're following open"},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"API so that you can\nuse all the tools that"},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"come with an ecosystem\nthat's been built up"},"323":{"dur":0,"text":"around these APIs."},"324":{"dur":3,"text":"So something we're really\ncommitted to in a Google Cloud."},"328":{"dur":1,"text":"Many improvements\nto persistent disks."},"330":{"dur":3,"text":"And then SQL went GA,\ngeneral availability,"},"333":{"dur":6,"text":"just last month with 99.95%\nSLA, larger instance types,"},"340":{"dur":3,"text":"and encryption of\nall data at rest."},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"But we didn't stop there."},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"We also introduced many\nimprovements to BigQuery."},"348":{"dur":3,"text":"So for example, now you can\njoin huge tables with ease"},"352":{"dur":3,"text":"and really do big data\ncomputing at scale."},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"We have dedicated\nmemcache that, again,"},"357":{"dur":3,"text":"scales to pretty much\narbitrary size and load."},"361":{"dur":1,"text":"Lots of other updates."},"363":{"dur":1,"text":"Mobile backend starter for iOS."},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"So now on both\nAndroid and in iOS,"},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"you can build the backend\nfor your application"},"370":{"dur":2,"text":"with very little effort."},"372":{"dur":4,"text":"And cloud endpoints,\nlike you do RESTful APIs,"},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"for your own applications\nwith little programming."},"380":{"dur":3,"text":"And just last month, we\nannounced HIPAA support,"},"383":{"dur":1,"text":"adding to the long\nlist of certifications"},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"that our cloud already has."},"388":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's great."},"390":{"dur":5,"text":"And I want to spend a little\nbit more time on one feature."},"395":{"dur":1,"text":"Just one of these--\nand we couldn't really"},"397":{"dur":1,"text":"mention all of them--\nbut one of them"},"399":{"dur":2,"text":"is live migration\nas we announced."},"401":{"dur":3,"text":"So when Compute Engine\nwent to GA last month--"},"405":{"dur":4,"text":"or last December, it came\nwith a unique feature"},"409":{"dur":1,"text":"called live migration."},"410":{"dur":1,"text":"Now why is that important?"},"412":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, as a cloud provider,\nyou're faced with a dilemma."},"416":{"dur":4,"text":"Because you can either have an\nup-to-date infrastructure-- you"},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"know, patch your\noperating systems,"},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"upgrade, introduce\nnew features, hands-on"},"426":{"dur":4,"text":"at a rapid pace-- or you\ncan provide long-running VMs"},"431":{"dur":1,"text":"to your users."},"432":{"dur":1,"text":"But you can't really do both."},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"Because if you apply a\nsecurity patch to the OS,"},"437":{"dur":1,"text":"in the underlying\nhost OS, and then"},"439":{"dur":5,"text":"have to reboot the machine, the\nVM can't really survive that."},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"But live migration\nsolves this dilemma"},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"and lets us provide both."},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"And to show you\nhow it works, I'd"},"451":{"dur":3,"text":"like to introduce Chris Elliott\nto give you a demo-- here"},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"you are, Chris--\nof live migration."},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"CHRIS ELLIOTT: So in order\nto demonstrate how seamless"},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"live migration is\nfor our customers,"},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"we built this sample\napplication here,"},"468":{"dur":3,"text":"which is going to live stream an\nHD video from an instance that"},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"is undergoing live migration."},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"This instance is physically\nmoving around in our data"},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"centers while we're live\nstreaming this video."},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"And this happens blazingly fast."},"480":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to walk\nyou through what"},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"you can expect to see here."},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"This instance down here,\nVOD 1, is the instance"},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"that'll be streaming the video."},"488":{"dur":1,"text":"And once we start\nlive migration,"},"490":{"dur":3,"text":"you'll see a spinning wheel\nappear on that instance."},"493":{"dur":1,"text":"Then it'll briefly\nflash yellow, and that"},"495":{"dur":3,"text":"is when the switch happens\nto the new physical host."},"499":{"dur":3,"text":"So without further delay\nhere, I have a terminal window"},"502":{"dur":3,"text":"into my instance, and I'm\ngoing to start a script that"},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"is keeping an eye out for\na signal we send to the VM"},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"when we're running\nlive migration."},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"This script is then going to\nfire off to the App Engine"},"513":{"dur":4,"text":"app you saw earlier\nand update that UI."},"517":{"dur":1,"text":"So, we're good there."},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's jump back over to the UI."},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"And I have an engineer\nwaiting by in Seattle"},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"to simulate a physical hardware\nfailure, such as a power"},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"supply overheating on\nthis current hardware"},"529":{"dur":0,"text":"where it's hosted."},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"And that will then\ntrigger live migration."},"532":{"dur":1,"text":"So let's get this started."},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we should\nsee, very shortly,"},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"that this VOD 1 instance\nwill start live migrating"},"545":{"dur":3,"text":"once she runs the tool."},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"And we'll wait for it\nto start live migrating"},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"until we start\nstreaming the video."},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"And here we go,\n1080P video streaming"},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"while this instance is\nundergoing live migration."},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"And so this is currently\nsyncing the two states"},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"of those physical\nmachines, getting"},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"ready to make that switch\nover to the new machine."},"565":{"dur":3,"text":"And it should happen\nany second now,"},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"because it's amazing how\nquickly-- and there it is!"},"570":{"dur":1,"text":"And now we're on a\nnew physical machine."},"572":{"dur":3,"text":"That is live migration, that\nis how quickly we can migrate."},"576":{"dur":5,"text":"[APPLAUSE]"},"581":{"dur":0,"text":"Thanks."},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's two points I\nwanted to highlight here."},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"One is, it's amazing--\nit fundamentally"},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"changes how developers\nbuild on virtual machines."},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"We have added\nintelligence to that layer"},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"so we can now proactively\nlive migrate you"},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"around hardware issues."},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"So you're always going to have\na high performant, consistent"},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"system."},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"Similarly, it allows us to\nupgrade under the covers"},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"so that you always have\nthe safest and most"},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"secure environment to\nrun your workloads on."},"606":{"dur":3,"text":"And the other aspect here is\nthis is completely transparent."},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"That is the real magic."},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"We built this demo on\nsignals that are available,"},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"but you shouldn't even\nreally care about this"},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"when you're running."},"616":{"dur":1,"text":"During development\nand testing, we"},"617":{"dur":1,"text":"had a test cluster\nwith customers"},"619":{"dur":1,"text":"running large\nproduction workloads."},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"And they were trying to find\nany performance hiccups to find"},"623":{"dur":1,"text":"when live migration happened."},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"We ended up getting email at\nthe end of the day asking hey,"},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"are you not doing\nlive migration?"},"628":{"dur":0,"text":"What's happening?"},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"When in reality, we moved\nthem back and forth 10 times"},"632":{"dur":1,"text":"that day."},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"It really is seamless fast."},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"The instance is\nexactly the same."},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"Same IP, same\nconfiguration, and you"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"really don't need to know\nabout it live migrating at all."},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"And at the end of the\nday, the only thing"},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"that actually tells\nyou it migrated"},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"is a little note in\nyour operations log."},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is how we can--one of\nthe ways we can provide high"},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"performance computing with\nCompute Engine and give"},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"developers the consistency\nthey expect from Google."},"654":{"dur":4,"text":"[APPLAUSE]"},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"URS HOLZLE: Thank you, Chris."},"660":{"dur":1,"text":"So you can see, even\nthough our VMs may"},"662":{"dur":1,"text":"look similar to\nother VMs, there's"},"664":{"dur":2,"text":"really a lot of innovation\nunder the covers"},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"that make it a unique platform."},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"Now let's take a look\nat what kind of adoption"},"671":{"dur":1,"text":"we've been seeing."},"673":{"dur":3,"text":"We now have over 4.75\nactive applications"},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"running in a Google\nCloud Platform,"},"679":{"dur":4,"text":"continuing the strong trend\nthat we've seen last year."},"683":{"dur":4,"text":"And App Engine alone gets over\n28 billion front end requests"},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"per day, every day."},"689":{"dur":4,"text":"So for comparison, that's more\nthan 10 Wikipedias-- worldwide"},"693":{"dur":5,"text":"Wikipedias-- just for\nApp Engine content."},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"On the back end with\nDatastore, the numbers"},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"are even more staggering."},"702":{"dur":5,"text":"Datastore currently serves\n6.3 trillion requests per day."},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"Now trillion is really a\nvery, very large number,"},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"so it's hard to put\nthat in relation."},"712":{"dur":5,"text":"One way to visualize it is as 30\noperations per day, every day,"},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"for every person\nliving on Earth."},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"Just in Datastore transactions."},"724":{"dur":1,"text":"And finally, we've\nbeen working a lot"},"726":{"dur":3,"text":"on being not just the fastest\ncloud but also the most"},"729":{"dur":1,"text":"cost effective cloud."},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's great to\nsee this starting"},"732":{"dur":3,"text":"to be recognized in the press.\n\"InfoWorld,\" for example,"},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"reported that we ran\ntheir benchmarks faster"},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"than any other cloud\nand less expensively"},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"than any other cloud."},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"So who is on Google Cloud

as\nquickly as possible."},"1049":{"dur":1,"text":"And so I turned\nagain, to App Engine,"},"1050":{"dur":1,"text":"something that I was\nvery familiar with."},"1052":{"dur":2,"text":"A platform that

think at the\ntime, App Engine"},"1063":{"dur":1,"text":"was actually still in preview."},"1064":{"dur":2,"text":"So we took a chance\non a new platform."},"1066":{"dur":2,"text":"But I was fairly confident,\ngiven Google's reputation"},"1069":{"dur":1,"text":"as a very strong\ninfrastructure company,"},"1070":{"dur":1,"text":"that anything we\nbuilt on App

looking\naround, and that"},"1123":{"dur":2,"text":"was exactly when Compute Engine\nlaunched to the general public."},"1126":{"dur":2,"text":"And so-- along with\noutgoing socket

times"},"1300":{"dur":2,"text":"worrying about things\nthat you shouldn't really"},"1303":{"dur":1,"text":"have to worry about."},"1304":{"dur":1,"text":"So too many things\nto think about."},"1306":{"dur":2,"text":"Too many trade-offs to make."},"1308":{"dur":3,"text":"And too much work that's\nnot really related"},"1311":{"dur":1,"text":"to building your app."},"1313":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's look at a few of them."},"1315":{"dur":1,"text":"Consider pricing."},"1316":{"dur":2,"text":"Pricing is still\nway too complex."},"1319":{"dur":2,"text":"It may seem cheap\nby comparison with"},"1321":{"dur":2,"text":"your on-premise alternatives."},"1323":{"dur":2,"text":"But there's still a lot\nof room for it to go down."},"1326":{"dur":1,"text":"And moreover, it\nseems like you need"},"1328":{"dur":2,"text":"a Ph.D. to figure\nout the best options."},"1331":{"dur":2,"text":"Should you use on\ndemand instances"},"1333":{"dur":3,"text":"that are flexible or\ncheaper reserved instances?"},"1337":{"dur":2,"text":"And should you pre-pay,\nand if so, how much?"},"1339":{"dur":1,"text":"And for how long are\nyou going to use them,"},"1341":{"dur":1,"text":"and how much are you\ngoing to use them"},"1342":{"dur":1,"text":"over the next year, et cetera?"},"1343":{"dur":3,"text":"How do you optimize your\ncost versus your

trade-offs."},"1354":{"dur":2,"text":"Like Bobby just\nmentioned, should you"},"1357":{"dur":2,"text":"get started really\nquickly but then"},"1359":{"dur":2,"text":"risk having to rewrite\neverything down the road?"},"1362":{"dur":1,"text":"Or should you build\nsomething scalable"},"1363":{"dur":2,"text":"but be less productive?"},"1366":{"dur":3,"text":"Now we want cloud to\nbe easier, and so we"},"1370":{"dur":2,"text":"want to solve both\nof these problems."},"1372":{"dur":2,"text":"And today, in the\nnext 10 minutes or so,"},"1374":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll talk about that."},"1375":{"dur":2,"text":"So first, let's\nstart with pricing."},"1378":{"dur":4,"text":"And the chart here\nillustrates the typical VM"},"1383":{"dur":3,"text":"in sort of the average industry\ncloud over the last five years"},"1387":{"dur":0,"text":"or so."},"1388":{"dur":3,"text":"So prices have been\nfalling by about 6% to 8%"},"1391":{"dur":2,"text":"per year, which is pretty nice."},"1394":{"dur":3,"text":"But hardware prices,\nduring the same five years,"},"1397":{"dur":4,"text":"have been falling by\nabout 20% to 30% a year."},"1402":{"dur":4,"text":"So the cost of the underlying\ncomponents, CPUs, RAM, flash,"},"1406":{"dur":4,"text":"disk-- has been\nfalling much faster."},"1410":{"dur":2,"text":"Because they've been\nfollowing Moore's law,"},"1413":{"dur":2,"text":"and cloud prices haven't."},"1415":{"dur":4,"text":"And so over time, that's opened\nquite a gap over several years."},"1420":{"dur":3,"text":"Easily a factor of two\nbetween the two curves."},"1424":{"dur":4,"text":"And we don't think that this\ngap should really exist."},"1428":{"dur":3,"text":"Because while the two\ncurves can't be identical,"},"1432":{"dur":4,"text":"because the VM price also\nincludes not just the capital"},"1436":{"dur":4,"text":"expenditures, but also the\ncost of running the VM, power,"},"1441":{"dur":3,"text":"space, maintenance,\nadministration, and so on."},"1444":{"dur":3,"text":"But the gap should be\nnowhere this large."},"1448":{"dur":2,"text":"We think the two curves should\nbe much closer together."},"1451":{"dur":1,"text":"And today we're\ntaking a big step"},"1452":{"dur":1,"text":"to bringing them much closer."},"1454":{"dur":2,"text":"And we think over the\nnext two or three years"},"1456":{"dur":3,"text":"that they will be\neven closer still."},"1460":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'll now describe\nhow we do this."},"1463":{"dur":6,"text":"First, we will have on demand\nprice reductions that make our"},"1469":{"dur":3,"text":"on demand pricing\nincredibly attractive."},"1472":{"dur":2,"text":"So Moore's Law at\nwork, basically."},"1475":{"dur":2,"text":"And then second,\nI'll show you how"},"1477":{"dur":2,"text":"you get additional\ndiscounts that traditionally"},"1480":{"dur":2,"text":"come with reserved instances."},"1482":{"dur":4,"text":"But with no upfront payment,\nno commitment, and no lock-in."},"1487":{"dur":3,"text":"And together, these\ntwo changes bring"},"1491":{"dur":3,"text":"you industry leading\nperformance, price"},"1494":{"dur":4,"text":"performance-- really by far--\nwithout the complexity that's"},"1498":{"dur":1,"text":"common in the industry."},"1500":{"dur":2,"text":"Yes."},"1502":{"dur":1,"text":"Just wait for the details."},"1504":{"dur":2,"text":"So let's get started with the\non demand price reductions."},"1506":{"dur":3,"text":"So we start with immediate\nprice reductions that bring our"},"1510":{"dur":3,"text":"on demand pricing to\nwhere it really should be,"},"1514":{"dur":0,"text":"given Moore's Law."},"1515":{"dur":2,"text":"On Compute Engine,\nwe're reducing prices"},"1517":{"dur":4,"text":"by 32% across the board\nand in all regions."},"1521":{"dur":4,"text":"So now our on demand price\nis lower than the three year"},"1525":{"dur":4,"text":"reserve price of\nmost other providers."},"1530":{"dur":1,"text":"But that's not all."},"1531":{"dur":5,"text":"In storage, we price all storage\nnow at a consistent $0.026"},"1537":{"dur":1,"text":"per gigabyte."},"1538":{"dur":2,"text":"No matter whether they\nuse it for App Engine,"},"1541":{"dur":1,"text":"or for Compute Engine."},"1542":{"dur":4,"text":"And no matter whether you\nstore a gigabyte or a petabyte."},"1546":{"dur":6,"text":"So for most users, that's a\n68% decrease in storage cost"},"1552":{"dur":2,"text":"and our lower cost,\nDRA alternative"},"1555":{"dur":2,"text":"that gives you the same\ndurability with a little bit"},"1557":{"dur":2,"text":"less availability, is $0.02."},"1560":{"dur":3,"text":"So now they're more than\n20% cheaper than that."},"1564":{"dur":0,"text":"But that's not all."},"1565":{"dur":6,"text":"On BigQuery, we're also reducing\nthe on demand prices by 85%."},"1571":{"dur":3,"text":"So now BigQuery is really\naccessible to everyone."},"1575":{"dur":2,"text":"And in BigQuery, we're\ngoing one step further"},"1577":{"dur":2,"text":"because our largest\ncustomers have told us"},"1579":{"dur":2,"text":"that they want\npredictable throughput"},"1582":{"dur":2,"text":"for their applications."},"1585":{"dur":2,"text":"And so now, you can\nanalyze any amount"},"1587":{"dur":4,"text":"of data with a chosen\nlevel of throughput"},"1591":{"dur":5,"text":"in 5 gigabyte per second\nincrements at a fixed price."},"1597":{"dur":5,"text":"So you can-- and\nyou just tell us"},"1602":{"dur":1,"text":"how much performance you want."},"1604":{"dur":2,"text":"what throughput do you want,\nand we just provision everything"},"1607":{"dur":1,"text":"So you don't have\nto worry about what"},"1609":{"dur":2,"text":"hardware resources you need\nto pick, and how many of them,"},"1611":{"dur":1,"text":"and where, etc."},"1613":{"dur":5,"text":"So with other cloud providers,\nor on-premise solutions,"},"1618":{"dur":2,"text":"if you wanted 5\ngigabytes per second"},"1621":{"dur":4,"text":"of query throughputs--\nso gigabytes per second,"},"1625":{"dur":4,"text":"not megabytes per second-- you'd\npay about $80,000 per month."},"1629":{"dur":3,"text":"And you'd have to worry about\npicking the right configuration"},"1632":{"dur":1,"text":"and everything."},"1633":{"dur":4,"text":"So with Compute Engine and\nBigQuery, this is just $20,000"},"1638":{"dur":0,"text":"a month."},"1639":{"dur":2,"text":"So 75% deduction."},"1641":{"dur":3,"text":"And on top of the\npredictable performance,"},"1644":{"dur":3,"text":"you also get on\ndemand elasticity"},"1648":{"dur":4,"text":"so that when your needs really\nspike, you can go even higher."},"1653":{"dur":3,"text":"So together, we are really\nresetting the price curve"},"1656":{"dur":2,"text":"in a cloud to\nwhere it should be."},"1658":{"dur":5,"text":"And this isn't a one time\nstep, this is a philosophy."},"1664":{"dur":3,"text":"The price trend of\nvirtualized hardware"},"1668":{"dur":4,"text":"should follow the price\ntrend of real hardware."},"1672":{"dur":3,"text":"So it should follow Moore's Law."},"1676":{"dur":2,"text":"And with the Google\nCloud Platform,"},"1678":{"dur":3,"text":"you're going to\nsee exactly that."},"1681":{"dur":4,"text":"Now one more problem with\npricing is really that"},"1686":{"dur":2,"text":"it's-- as I mentioned--\nit's too complicated."},"1689":{"dur":4,"text":"So now we've lowered the\nprices, but the original dream"},"1693":{"dur":2,"text":"of the cloud-- and\nthe original promise--"},"1696":{"dur":2,"text":"was that you could\nget elastic capacity."},"1698":{"dur":3,"text":"So on demand capacity, you\nonly pay for what you use."},"1702":{"dur":2,"text":"You don't have to preprovision,\nyou don't have to commit,"},"1705":{"dur":4,"text":"and it's cheaper than\nanything you can do yourself."},"1709":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, the industry\nhasn't really evolved"},"1713":{"dur":2,"text":"towards that simple concept."},"1716":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, along the way, things\nhave gotten more complicated."},"1719":{"dur":1,"text":"Much more complicated."},"1721":{"dur":4,"text":"Here's a graph that shows the\ntotal cost of a typical VM"},"1725":{"dur":4,"text":"over three years given\ndifferent pricing choices."},"1729":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can see that there's a\nhuge difference, a factor of 10"},"1732":{"dur":3,"text":"difference, between the\nlowest and the highest price,"},"1736":{"dur":2,"text":"depending on what\nprice plan you choose."},"1738":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's the same resource."},"1740":{"dur":1,"text":"So for the same\nresource, you can"},"1742":{"dur":3,"text":"pay 10 times more if\nyou don't pay attention."},"1745":{"dur":4,"text":"So the question is, should\nyou use on demand instances,"},"1749":{"dur":2,"text":"or should you prepay to\nget a reserved instance?"},"1752":{"dur":3,"text":"And if so, how much do you\nprepay, and for how long"},"1756":{"dur":1,"text":"do you want to\nreserve this instance?"},"1758":{"dur":2,"text":"And you have to\nguess how much am I"},"1760":{"dur":3,"text":"going to actually use\nthis VM for the next year?"},"1764":{"dur":1,"text":"Or the next three years?"},"1765":{"dur":5,"text":"This is not simple, on\ndemand, elastic computing."},"1770":{"dur":3,"text":"This requires a Ph.D. in\nfinance to kind of get right."},"1774":{"dur":2,"text":"And so either you have\nsomeone on your team"},"1776":{"dur":2,"text":"who spends a lot of time\nworrying about this."},"1779":{"dur":3,"text":"Or, you're probably\npaying too much."},"1782":{"dur":2,"text":"Or both."},"1784":{"dur":3,"text":"So this isn't completely crazy."},"1788":{"dur":2,"text":"Reserved instances\nactually have a purpose,"},"1790":{"dur":2,"text":"because they try to\nreward you for having"},"1793":{"dur":3,"text":"a predictable,\nsustained workload."},"1796":{"dur":1,"text":"And of course you\nshould get a discount"},"1797":{"dur":2,"text":"for having a sustained workload."},"1800":{"dur":2,"text":"But we think that you\nshould get that discount"},"1803":{"dur":5,"text":"with no upfront price, with\nno upfront expenditures."},"1808":{"dur":6,"text":"With no contract, no lock-in,\nand just no complexity."},"1814":{"dur":2,"text":"So how do we do that?"},"1816":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll show you how."},"1817":{"dur":4,"text":"Today we're introducing\nsustained-use discounts."},"1822":{"dur":2,"text":"We want you to be\nrewarded automatically"},"1824":{"dur":3,"text":"for having sustained usage\nwithout you requiring"},"1828":{"dur":0,"text":"to preplan."},"1829":{"dur":3,"text":"So we're moving the burden\nof planning from you to us."},"1833":{"dur":1,"text":"How does this work?"},"1834":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, here's an example."},"1835":{"dur":3,"text":"We start with the low rates\nthat we just announced."},"1838":{"dur":2,"text":"So rates that are lower\nthere anywhere else."},"1841":{"dur":4,"text":"But once you use a VM for\nmore than 25% of the month,"},"1846":{"dur":2,"text":"your price starts dropping."},"1848":{"dur":5,"text":"So every additional\nminute becomes cheaper."},"1853":{"dur":8,"text":"So that means that if you\nhave a 24\/7 workload that you"},"1861":{"dur":3,"text":"use for an entire month,\nlike a database instance,"},"1865":{"dur":6,"text":"then in effect, you get a 53%\ndiscount over today's prices."},"1871":{"dur":4,"text":"And what's even better,\nyou don't-- this price,"},"1876":{"dur":4,"text":"this discount applies to all\ninstances of a certain type"},"1881":{"dur":0,"text":"in a region."},"1882":{"dur":3,"text":"So even if you have a VM\nthat you restart frequently,"},"1885":{"dur":5,"text":"as long as that VM in\naggregate is used more than 25%"},"1890":{"dur":2,"text":"of the month, you\nget that discount."},"1893":{"dur":3,"text":"So simple, easy\npricing that gives you"},"1896":{"dur":3,"text":"a discount based on your\nactual usage with no commitment"},"1900":{"dur":0,"text":"upfront."},"1901":{"dur":2,"text":"And remember that our pricing\nalready has simplicity"},"1903":{"dur":3,"text":"built in in all kinds\nof other places."},"1906":{"dur":1,"text":"So you have per minute\nbilling, where you only"},"1908":{"dur":2,"text":"pay for the minutes\nyou actually use."},"1911":{"dur":4,"text":"And you have linear scaling\nof prices across VM types."},"1916":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you need a VM\nthat has four times more"},"1918":{"dur":3,"text":"CPU and four times more\nRAM than your current VM,"},"1922":{"dur":2,"text":"you're going to pay a rate\nthat is four times higher."},"1925":{"dur":3,"text":"There's no penalty for\nusing a larger machine."},"1928":{"dur":3,"text":"Things just scale\nas they should."},"1932":{"dur":2,"text":"So with these price\nprinciples, we've"},"1934":{"dur":3,"text":"really taken the\nguesswork out of pricing."},"1937":{"dur":3,"text":"Your developers no longer have\nto double as finance planners."},"1941":{"dur":2,"text":"We do that for you."},"1943":{"dur":4,"text":"You automatically get discounts\nbased on your actual sustained"},"1948":{"dur":2,"text":"usage without any commitments."},"1950":{"dur":3,"text":"And that really was the\noriginal dream of the cloud"},"1954":{"dur":1,"text":"that I talked about."},"1955":{"dur":2,"text":"You have on demand capacity."},"1958":{"dur":4,"text":"You pay for just what you need,\nbut you get a great price."},"1963":{"dur":4,"text":"That is a world\nthat you can live in"},"1967":{"dur":2,"text":"as long as you use the\nGoogle Cloud because that's"},"1970":{"dur":2,"text":"the experience\nyou'll have with us."},"1973":{"dur":3,"text":"So now let's turn\nto the other part"},"1976":{"dur":3,"text":"that makes cloud computing\nharder than it could be."},"1980":{"dur":2,"text":"And mostly it's that\nyou have to work around"},"1983":{"dur":4,"text":"certain limitations that\nare in the cloud that"},"1987":{"dur":3,"text":"causes you to do extra work."},"1991":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's look at a few of them."},"1992":{"dur":6,"text":"First, just the basic\nproblem of time to

it."},"2304":{"dur":2,"text":"You shouldn't have to choose\nbetween developer productivity"},"2306":{"dur":1,"text":"and scalability."},"2308":{"dur":3,"text":"So to do that, we've been\nfocusing on a

have them integrate into the\ncloud platform really nicely."},"2337":{"dur":2,"text":"Second, when you\ndo a deployment,"},"2339":{"dur":2,"text":"you should have the confidence\nto know that the deployment is"},"2342":{"dur":3,"text":"successful and that you didn't\nhave a bad deployment that"},"2345":{"dur":2,"text":"resulted in your\napp not working."},"2348":{"dur":3,"text":"And third, when problems\ncome up in production--"},"2351":{"dur":1,"text":"and they will come\nup in production."},"2353":{"dur":2,"text":"Because they never come up\nin testing servers, right?"},"2355":{"dur":1,"text":"It's only production."},"2357":{"dur":2,"text":"You should have the\nability to easily spot"},"2359":{"dur":3,"text":"those problems in production\nand, with one click,"},"2363":{"dur":2,"text":"make fixes so that your\napp is back on track"},"2366":{"dur":3,"text":"running like you want without\nhaving to do a bunch of context"},"2369":{"dur":3,"text":"switching from the console\ninto a bunch of other tools."},"2373":{"dur":2,"text":"So to give us a look at\nexactly these things,"},"2376":{"dur":1,"text":"I want to bring up Brad Abrams."},"2378":{"dur":3,"text":"He leads the product management\nteam for our developer"},"2381":{"dur":1,"text":"experiences group."},"2382":{"dur":2,"text":"And he's going to

out."},"2406":{"dur":3,"text":"So what we're looking at here\nis the Google Developer Console"},"2410":{"dur":1,"text":"for Greg's application."},"2412":{"dur":2,"text":"But before we drill into\nthe console, how many people"},"2415":{"dur":1,"text":"are command line fans?"},"2416":{"dur":2,"text":"How many people are more\nproductive on the command line?"},"2418":{"dur":0,"text":"Let's hear it."},"2419":{"dur":0,"text":"OK."},"2420":{"dur":1,"text":"Great, yes, me too."},"2421":{"dur":1,"text":"So we're going to start there."},"2423":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm going to show you our\nnew gcloud command line tool."},"2427":{"dur":2,"text":"The reason I'm more\nproductive on the command line"},"2429":{"dur":3,"text":"is because of keyboard\nshortcuts like Tab completion."},"2433":{"dur":2,"text":"So I can just say\ngcloud Tab, Tab."},"2436":{"dur":1,"text":"And that shows me\nthe list of options"},"2438":{"dur":1,"text":"that are available there."},"2439":{"dur":4,"text":"And then-- if I can type--\na Tab again completes that."},"2444":{"dur":2,"text":"Oh yeah, and then what are\nthe options for components,"},"2447":{"dur":1,"text":"I can't remember?"},"2448":{"dur":2,"text":"Oh, right, list\nis the one I want."},"2450":{"dur":1,"text":"Tab finishes that out."},"2451":{"dur":2,"text":"So pretty cool, huh?"},"2454":{"dur":1,"text":"OK."},"2456":{"dur":1,"text":"Fine, OK."},"2457":{"dur":3,"text":"So we have a set of\ncomponents that are available."},"2461":{"dur":1,"text":"I can add and\nremove those, but I"},"2463":{"dur":1,"text":"have what I think I need there."},"2465":{"dur":1,"text":"So we'll clear that."},"2466":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'll do another\ngcloud command,"},"2468":{"dur":6,"text":"and we'll go ahead--\ncloud event 2014--"},"2475":{"dur":3,"text":"we'll go ahead and bring\ndown code that Greg's already"},"2478":{"dur":2,"text":"started on to our\nlocal workspace"},"2480":{"dur":2,"text":"so that we can get\nstarted with this."},"2483":{"dur":2,"text":"So let's take a look at\nwhat Greg's already got."},"2485":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going to use my second\nfavorite editor here"},"2488":{"dur":3,"text":"to check out Greg's code."},"2492":{"dur":2,"text":"And there, Greg, I think\nI see your problem."},"2494":{"dur":1,"text":"You forgot to give it a title."},"2496":{"dur":2,"text":"So let's see if we can do that."},"2499":{"dur":3,"text":"So GCP Live."},"2502":{"dur":1,"text":"OK, just save that."},"2504":{"dur":2,"text":"Now we're going to\nuse Git to commit that"},"2507":{"dur":1,"text":"to our local repository."},"2508":{"dur":2,"text":"How many big Git fans\nare there that use Git?"},"2511":{"dur":0,"text":"Yes?"},"2512":{"dur":1,"text":"Awesome."},"2513":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'll do a Git commit."},"2516":{"dur":5,"text":"And I'll say add a\ntitle or whatever."},"2522":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I'm going to go\nahead and do a Git push."},"2525":{"dur":4,"text":"So when I did the gcloud init,\nI initialized my local

up."},"2536":{"dur":2,"text":"So if we switch over\nhere to the console,"},"2538":{"dur":3,"text":"you'll see, when I refresh\nthis, that our new source code"},"2542":{"dur":3,"text":"viewer in the console has\nthat change that we looked at."},"2546":{"dur":1,"text":"There it is."},"2547":{"dur":1,"text":"GCP Live."},"2549":{"dur":2,"text":"And now if I switch\nover to releases,"},"2552":{"dur":3,"text":"we see this is the\nGit URL that we"},"2555":{"dur":2,"text":"offer as part of every\ndeveloper console project."},"2558":{"dur":2,"text":"You get a free\nprivate Git repository"},"2561":{"dur":2,"text":"that's accessible to all the\nmembers of your development"},"2563":{"dur":1,"text":"team on this project."},"2565":{"dur":0,"text":"GREG DEMICHILLIE: Now\nthat's really cool,"},"2566":{"dur":1,"text":"and a lot of people do use Git."},"2567":{"dur":1,"text":"But a lot of people\nalso use GitHub,"},"2569":{"dur":2,"text":"whether it's for public\nopen source projects"},"2571":{"dur":1,"text":"or even for private repos."},"2573":{"dur":1,"text":"So is there support\nfor that, too?"},"2574":{"dur":1,"text":"BRAD ABRAMS: Absolutely Greg."},"2576":{"dur":3,"text":"At Google, we are\nbig fans of GitHub."},"2580":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we've gone ahead\nand added a Connect"},"2582":{"dur":2,"text":"to GitHub button,\nso all the features"},"2585":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to show you\nwork great if you're"},"2587":{"dur":3,"text":"using a GitHub repository\nor one of ours."},"2590":{"dur":5,"text":"So regardless of which you\nuse, as a post commit action,"},"2595":{"dur":2,"text":"you have your choice\nas to what happens."},"2598":{"dur":3,"text":"We can do a build, run\na set of unit tests"},"2601":{"dur":2,"text":"before we deploy\nthat into production."},"2604":{"dur":2,"text":"In this case, we've set\nit to build with Maven,"},"2607":{"dur":3,"text":"run unit test, and then\ndeploy to our cloud platform."},"2610":{"dur":3,"text":"To give you a peek inside a\nlittle bit about what's really"},"2613":{"dur":4,"text":"happening, when we configured\nthat build, what we did"},"2618":{"dur":2,"text":"is we spin up a Compute\nEngine instance."},"2620":{"dur":3,"text":"And we installed on your\nbehalf half Jenkins, Maven,"},"2624":{"dur":4,"text":"JDK-- everything we needed\nto do reliable builds."},"2628":{"dur":1,"text":"And then when that\nGit push happened,"},"2630":{"dur":4,"text":"we pulled down all the\ncode and did a clean build."},"2634":{"dur":3,"text":"And then when that build passed,\nwe ran all your unit test"},"2638":{"dur":1,"text":"and then pushed\nit to production."},"2640":{"dur":4,"text":"So you can be more sure you get\na safe, reliable deployment."},"2644":{"dur":3,"text":"And you can see, as I practiced\nthis demo, those spikes in the"},"2647":{"dur":1,"text":"build machines."},"2649":{"dur":2,"text":"So if we switch back\nover to cloud deployment,"},"2652":{"dur":2,"text":"you can see our release history."},"2654":{"dur":3,"text":"And what you see here is\nthat we added that title,"},"2657":{"dur":3,"text":"we did a build test, and we\ndeployed that into production,"},"2661":{"dur":2,"text":"all in the time we've\nbeen talking here."},"2663":{"dur":2,"text":"So if we switch over\nand see Greg's app."},"2666":{"dur":3,"text":"Greg, it looks like a\nlittle meme application."},"2669":{"dur":2,"text":"That's kind of cool."},"2671":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's going to\nrefresh with-- and we"},"2673":{"dur":3,"text":"see these-- here are\nthe memes you have."},"2677":{"dur":0,"text":"Yes."},"2678":{"dur":3,"text":"That's cute, petabytes of data."},"2681":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's the\ntitle that we added."},"2683":{"dur":1,"text":"That's great."},"2684":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm interested in what our top\nmemes are here at the cloud"},"2688":{"dur":2,"text":"event, so let's check those out."},"2690":{"dur":2,"text":"Oh, Greg."},"2692":{"dur":1,"text":"You have a server error here."},"2694":{"dur":3,"text":"A 500 server error,\nthat's not good."},"2697":{"dur":2,"text":"These kind of issues\nare hard enough"},"2700":{"dur":2,"text":"to debug when it's on\nyour local machine."},"2702":{"dur":2,"text":"But when you have an issue\nlike this in production,"},"2705":{"dur":1,"text":"it's even harder."},"2706":{"dur":4,"text":"So to give you a sense about\ndebugging this in production,"},"2711":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm going to switch over and\ngive some simulated load."},"2715":{"dur":3,"text":"So just going to throw a\nlot of traffic at that site."},"2718":{"dur":1,"text":"I saw some of you\ncopying down the URL,"},"2720":{"dur":4,"text":"so you might be throwing\nsome traffic at it as well."},"2724":{"dur":3,"text":"So we'll go over and look\nat how we debug that issue."},"2727":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'm going to bring up\nthe new unified logs viewer."},"2731":{"dur":3,"text":"And we're getting a log\nentry for every request"},"2734":{"dur":0,"text":"that comes in."},"2735":{"dur":2,"text":"And you saw, it just\nthrew a bunch of

it's easy for me to find the\nlogs that I'm interested in."},"2755":{"dur":5,"text":"I can also filter these or, in\nthis particular place though,"},"2760":{"dur":3,"text":"I want to look for a

do, as a developer,"},"2801":{"dur":1,"text":"is jump into the source."},"2803":{"dur":3,"text":"Because that's where we're going\nto be able to fix this problem."},"2806":{"dur":2,"text":"But I have all this\ncontext loaded in my head."},"2808":{"dur":1,"text":"I need to get to\nthe source quick"},"2810":{"dur":2,"text":"so I can start\nbringing that to bear."},"2812":{"dur":1,"text":"So what I'm going\nto do is notice"},"2814":{"dur":2,"text":"that right here, this\nis actually a hyperlink."},"2816":{"dur":2,"text":"So if I click right\non this hyperlink,"},"2818":{"dur":4,"text":"it brings

that\nmake their application unique"},"2997":{"dur":3,"text":"and let us at Google handle\nall of the stuff like scaling,"},"3000":{"dur":1,"text":"and management,\nand configuration,"},"3002":{"dur":2,"text":"and let us carry a pager\nso you don't have to."},"3005":{"dur":2,"text":"But today you face\na tough choice."},"3007":{"dur":3,"text":"Do I use products like\nCompute Engine, infrastructure"},"3011":{"dur":4,"text":"as a service, that give me\ntotal flexibility on open source"},"3015":{"dur":1,"text":"packages I use?"},"3016":{"dur":3,"text":"And

want and still get\nthe auto management,"},"3048":{"dur":3,"text":"auto capabilities of\nproducts like App Engine."},"3052":{"dur":4,"text":"So today we're introducing\nmanaged virtual

managed\non your behalf"},"3063":{"dur":2,"text":"with all of the\ngoodness of App Engine."},"3066":{"dur":3,"text":"So this gives you a new way to\nthink about building

demo."},"3133":{"dur":1,"text":"So what we're going\nto do is we're"},"3134":{"dur":2,"text":"going to have clients that are\nrunning inside of Chrome that"},"3136":{"dur":1,"text":"are communicating back\nwith a fleet of managed"},"3138":{"dur":2,"text":"VMs via WebSockets, for\nlow latency communications."},"3141":{"dur":1,"text":"And on these managed\nVMs, we're

ends."},"3160":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, as Greg alluded to,\nthat kind of technology"},"3162":{"dur":3,"text":"is not typically supported\non platforms as a service,"},"3165":{"dur":1,"text":"and not what App\nEngine is today."},"3166":{"dur":2,"text":"With managed VMs, this\nis totally possible."},"3169":{"dur":2,"text":"Furthermore, we make\nit very easy to get up"},"3171":{"dur":0,"text":"and started with this."},"3172":{"dur":2,"text":"So let me show you, we're going\nto pop over to my terminal"},"3174":{"dur":0,"text":"here."},"3175":{"dur":2,"text":"And what we see is a typical\nApp

through\nthese settings here."},"3189":{"dur":1,"text":"So the first thing is\nwe're setting VM true."},"3191":{"dur":2,"text":"That's telling the system I\nwant to run this on a managed VM"},"3193":{"dur":2,"text":"so I have access to native\nresources and the ability"},"3196":{"dur":1,"text":"to run native code."},"3197":{"dur":2,"text":"Furthermore, we get into a new\nsection

third party\nlibraries like that"},"3244":{"dur":3,"text":"and get them onto those managed\nVMs in a super simple way."},"3248":{"dur":1,"text":"The next line is we're\nopening up a

to\nspecify two instances,"},"3259":{"dur":1,"text":"because that's more than\nenough for this demo,"},"3261":{"dur":2,"text":"especially since we're\nrunning 8-core machines."},"3263":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're going to escape\nfrom this, save it."},"3265":{"dur":2,"text":"Now since we're running\nin the Java runtime,"},"3268":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's a Java

so"},"3277":{"dur":2,"text":"can we cut back to\nthe slides, please?"},"3280":{"dur":1,"text":"All right, the first\nthing that's happening"},"3281":{"dur":1,"text":"is we're relying\non our gcloud

is,"},"3288":{"dur":1,"text":"it's going to communicate\nto our deployment endpoints"},"3289":{"dur":2,"text":"and say, OK, I want to\ndeploy this application."},"3291":{"dur":1,"text":"Those deployment\nendpoints are going"},"3293":{"dur":2,"text":"to store some metadata\nabout the application."},"3295":{"dur":1,"text":"The version, the\ntemplate, the number"},"3297":{"dur":1,"text":"of instances that are running."},"3298":{"dur":1,"text":"And then from there,\nwe're going to go off"},"3299":{"dur":2,"text":"and we're going to create\nthe actual

going to\ncreate secure name spaces"},"3318":{"dur":2,"text":"so that everything is secure\nwithin those multi-tenant"},"3321":{"dur":1,"text":"And we're going to\nset up smart

ImageMagick on\nthose managed VMs."},"3340":{"dur":1,"text":"And then most\nimportantly, your code."},"3342":{"dur":1,"text":"We're going to\nbring all that up,"},"3343":{"dur":0,"text":"we're going to do\nsome health checking,"},"3344":{"dur":0,"text":"make sure everything's\nrunning correctly."},"3345":{"dur":2,"text":"And assuming it is, we're going\nto install a load

sure it's colocated\nwith the other pieces"},"3353":{"dur":1,"text":"of compute that you're running."},"3355":{"dur":1,"text":"So in this case,\nBrad had showed you"},"3356":{"dur":1,"text":"some

low\nlatency and improve"},"3361":{"dur":2,"text":"the overall performance."},"3363":{"dur":3,"text":"All right, so if we can\njump back to the demo."},"3367":{"dur":1,"text":"All right, so our\nbuild succeeded."},"3369":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's go check\nthat out in Chrome."},"3371":{"dur":1,"text":"So we'll pull this\nup, we'll navigate"},"3373":{"dur":3,"text":"to the URL that's\nprovisioned for
