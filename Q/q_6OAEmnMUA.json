always\ngoing to give out"},"144":{"dur":2,"text":"requests to do this and do\nthis and figure things out."},"147":{"dur":2,"text":"And he'd never done it\neither, of course, you

like\nto work with him when"},"238":{"dur":1,"text":"you first initially met him?"},"240":{"dur":3,"text":"Because obviously, he was really\nfamous, really well known."},"243":{"dur":3,"text":"So what kind of man was\nhe like to work with?"},"246":{"dur":4,"text":"BOB GURR: On one hand,\nhe was very serious."},"250":{"dur":3,"text":"And on the other hand, when he\nwas excited about something,"},"254":{"dur":2,"text":"that little eyebrow\nwould just shoot up."},"256":{"dur":2,"text":"And he had that little\ntwinkle in his eye like,"},"259":{"dur":2,"text":"oh, I'm going to have\nsomething nobody's got."},"261":{"dur":1,"text":"Wait till I show the\nworld this thing."},"263":{"dur":2,"text":"So kind of a pixie-like thing."},"265":{"dur":3,"text":"But day in, day out\nI would say he's kind"},"268":{"dur":3,"text":"of slightly serious, slightly\nagitated a little bit."},"272":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think the\nsource of that was,"},"274":{"dur":2,"text":"like, you run

down real quick."},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"Then I got to go to work in the\nmorning and hope I remember it."},"294":{"dur":1,"text":"His mind worked like that."},"296":{"dur":3,"text":"And a lot of people-- he\ncollected work just like that."},"299":{"dur":3,"text":"It wasn't an eight\nhour type of day."},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"Walt also had another\ncharacteristic"},"304":{"dur":3,"text":"that was kind of fascinating\nand very natural,"},"308":{"dur":3,"text":"and I've seen other executives\nin later years do this."},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"Instead of having a\nclassical

other thing."},"347":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's say you're\nworking on something"},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"and you thought you\nunderstood what you wanted,"},"351":{"dur":3,"text":"and then he sees it,

yeah."},"386":{"dur":4,"text":"But the way he would do it\nis, let's say you're not"},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"doing quite as expected."},"393":{"dur":1,"text":"He wouldn't chew you out."},"395":{"dur":3,"text":"He'd actually look at something\nand he'd say, say, Bobby."},"399":{"dur":4,"text":"Did you ever think of-- oh, I\ndidn't think of that one, Walt."},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"Now you are-- you\ncan't wait to share"},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"your new idea of his\nnew idea that just"},"409":{"dur":1,"text":"happened 20 seconds

understand?"},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"That's how that kind\nof a loop works."},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"That to him was natural, and\npeople that would work there,"},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"it didn't take very\nlong before that"},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"was their natural, daily MO."},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"Now I've also got to\nremember, to a lot of people,"},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"let's say even as\nlate as one 1954"},"431":{"dur":3,"text":"when I started with the\ncompany, a guy like Walt"},"434":{"dur":1,"text":"would seem like a god."},"436":{"dur":3,"text":"In other words, I'm a\nseriously-- a really famous,"},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"famous person."},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"I would see times there'd be\nexecutives at other companies."},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"They'd get too

make\nhimself look kind of ratty"},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"so as he could have\na conversation."},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"And he would always\npoint out to people,"},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"he says, well, you know,\nto get this stuff done,"},"463":{"dur":1,"text":"I have to talk to\npeople, you know?"},"465":{"dur":3,"text":"And so the rhythm in\nthe company always"},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"developed all over a while."},"471":{"dur":1,"text":"Took a couple of\nweeks to get used"},"472":{"dur":1,"text":"to the fact that, oh, my

Now it's a\ncase of, hiya, Walt. It's just"},"478":{"dur":0,"text":"as simple as that."},"479":{"dur":3,"text":"Because now you have to have--\neverybody's on that same level."},"482":{"dur":4,"text":"Now you can have a critique,\nand the design is good"},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"or the design is bad,\nor needs some work."},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"Now if the design was good,\nwhat you're doing is good,"},"491":{"dur":1,"text":"Walt would simply walk in."},"492":{"dur":0,"text":"He'd just look around."},"493":{"dur":1,"text":"Sometimes he\nwouldn't say a word."},"495":{"dur":0,"text":"He'd just walk around."},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"He'd look at your drafting\nboard or maybe say something,"},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"and he'd walk out."},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"About five minutes later,\nthe guy down the hall"},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"would come and run into the\nroom and says, what is it"},"506":{"dur":0,"text":"you're doing?"},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"Walt just came in\nand said, you gotta"},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"go see what Gurr's\ndoing down there."},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"That's your attaboy."},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"Now see, he never gave a\npersonal attaboy to anybody."},"515":{"dur":1,"text":"You just don't do that."},"517":{"dur":1,"text":"But he couldn't wait\nto go tell somebody"},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"else how good your stuff was."},"521":{"dur":4,"text":"So this was a very strange\nkind of way to do that."},"525":{"dur":3,"text":"He had another characteristic\nwhen he was coming down"},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"the hallway to go to your room."},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"You see that little cough?"},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"He had a little double cough."},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"And this was like you had\nthe 10 second warning."},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, clean up your\nact real quick there."},"540":{"dur":1,"text":"Your door's always open."},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"You never leave a\nclosed door there,"},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"because he will show up at\nany time without warning"},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"and in any building."},"547":{"dur":1,"text":"In particular, the shops."},"548":{"dur":3,"text":"He loved to run around in\nthe shops all the time."},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's the general\nset and setting."},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"That's a long way to\nanswer, what was Walt"},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"like to work with?"},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"A lot of people today\nwill say, well, no."},"559":{"dur":1,"text":"That was 50 years ago."},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"People don't work like that."},"561":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, some years ago when\nI had my own company later,"},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"I worked for Steven

little set of\nbuildings out in Universal next"},"576":{"dur":1,"text":"to a river."},"577":{"dur":1,"text":"He did exactly the same thing."},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"He talked the people\ndoing the
