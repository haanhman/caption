this meme."},"1530":{"dur":4,"text":"So, don't give in to the temptation of engaging in fights just for the sake of it."},"1534":{"dur":4,"text":"Which may be more difficult than it sounds, if you are

any good if you don't pick your opponents and objectives well."},"1550":{"dur":1,"text":"So you've went and done all of that..."},"1552":{"dur":2,"text":"and then suddenly, you hear the dreaded words:"},"1554":{"dur":2,"text":"You are accused of being a RACIST!"},"1557":{"dur":2,"text":"How do you respond to that charge?"},"1559":{"dur":2,"text":"Your lifelong programming is about to kick

excuses."},"1585":{"dur":1,"text":"But let's just hold on for a sec,"},"1587":{"dur":1,"text":"What does this really mean at all?"},"1589":{"dur":1,"text":"Who is a 'Racist' ?"},"1591":{"dur":1,"text":"What's the meaning of this term?"},"1593":{"dur":2,"text":"It means that you have broken the moral code."},"1596":{"dur":2,"text":"That you are a heretic, a witch,"},"1598":{"dur":3,"text":"that is about to be burned on the stake by the inquisition."},"1601":{"dur":2,"text":"So if we were to restate this charge a,"},"1604":{"dur":1,"text":"being accused of being a Witch?"},"1605":{"dur":1,"text":"How would you handle that?!"},"1607":{"dur":1,"text":"What would you actually say?"},"1609":{"dur":3,"text":"And I don't mean that just metaphorically, but actually!"},"1613":{"dur":1,"text":"What would you actually do,"},"1614":{"dur":2,"text":"if you were being accused of being a witch?"},"1617":{"dur":2,"text":"That you have made a pact with the devil?"},"1620":{"dur":3,"text":"Would you say that it wasn't you who made the pact but... someone else?"},"1623":{"dur":3,"text":"Or would you say that you haven't seen the devil since at least last week?"},"1627":{"dur":5,"text":"Or that you have looked up the definition of a which in a dictionary, and you don't think your qualify?"},"1633":{"dur":1,"text":"You would just laugh and move on."},"1635":{"dur":3,"text":"And that is pretty much what you need to do for the real thing,"},"1638":{"dur":2,"text":"as the charge is essentially the same."},"1641":{"dur":2,"text":"People are no longer not burned on stakes for witchcraft"},"1644":{"dur":3,"text":"because they convinced the inquisition that they are not witches,"},"1647":{"dur":3,"text":"but simply because people no longer believe that witches exist."},"1651":{"dur":4,"text":"Of course the difference is that people still believe today that 'racism' is real."},"1655":{"dur":3,"text":"So you will actually have to address this issue and answer them properly."},"1659":{"dur":2,"text":"Yet, the solution is going to be the same,"},"1662":{"dur":4,"text":"you will just have to convince your opponents, that what they believe is not real,"},"1666":{"dur":3,"text":"rather than trying to defend yourself against the charge itself."},"1670":{"dur":1,"text":"This may sound almost the same,"},"1672":{"dur":1,"text":"but there is a world of difference,"},"1674":{"dur":2,"text":"so let me elaborate on this a bit further."},"1678":{"dur":2,"text":"this isn't about one argument against another,"},"1681":{"dur":2,"text":"but one world-view versus another."},"1683":{"dur":2,"text":"If their narrative triumphs, then that means,"},"1686":{"dur":2,"text":"that the only role available for you in Their play,"},"1688":{"dur":1,"text":"is the role of the villain."},"1690":{"dur":1,"text":"And the only way to avoid that,"},"1692":{"dur":4,"text":"is NOT by saying that you are not playing the villain, but are actually one of the good guys,"},"1696":{"dur":2,"text":"but to point out that their game is bogus."},"1699":{"dur":1,"text":"Don't say that you are not a racist!"},"1701":{"dur":3,"text":"But instead, that there is no such thing as racism."},"1704":{"dur":1,"text":"That it is a meaningless term."},"1706":{"dur":4,"text":"An invalid concept and that you reject the very terminology of it."},"1711":{"dur":3,"text":"You may think I'm obsessing over just words."},"1714":{"dur":1,"text":"But there is more to it."},"1716":{"dur":2,"text":"If you look carefully at these everyday phrases,"},"1719":{"dur":1,"text":"you may notice something."},"1721":{"dur":4,"text":"These are all value-laden professionally constructed weapons in the shape of words,"},"1725":{"dur":2,"text":"that carry within them an entire world view."},"1729":{"dur":4,"text":"You may find it very difficult to win an argument, if you are using too many of these terms."},"1733":{"dur":4,"text":"Because they are all somehow magically loaded with your opponents ideology."},"1738":{"dur":2,"text":"But of course there is one word to rule them all..."},"1741":{"dur":1,"text":"'RACISM'."},"1742":{"dur":1,"text":"Literally,"},"1743":{"dur":4,"text":"billions of dollars were spent to compress a large chunk of an ideology into this single word,"},"1748":{"dur":3,"text":"that was constructed in such way so that it can only be used one way."},"1752":{"dur":2,"text":"Just like how in Tolkien\u2019s world,"},"1754":{"dur":2,"text":"the One Ring can only ever be used to ultimately,"},"1757":{"dur":2,"text":"carry out the dark lord Sauron\u2019s will."},"1761":{"dur":4,"text":"Using charged words like that is a bit like making a purchase on a market place."},"1766":{"dur":2,"text":"Each term can only be used appropriately,"},"1768":{"dur":1,"text":"or you have to pay their price."},"1770":{"dur":2,"text":"How about a pound of Racism please?"},"1773":{"dur":2,"text":"That will be two billion dollars sir."},"1775":{"dur":2,"text":"So how do you win this 'War of the Words'?"},"1778":{"dur":4,"text":"As you are unlikely to be a billionaire and therefore cannot afford a hard counter-attack,"},"1783":{"dur":3,"text":"the best you could do is to employ asymmetric warfare tactics."},"1787":{"dur":1,"text":"Simply move the goal post,"},"1789":{"dur":2,"text":"by avoiding the terms they have monopoly over"},"1791":{"dur":3,"text":"and use different ones to describe the same thing."},"1795":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you are forced to use one of their terms,"},"1797":{"dur":3,"text":"then only ever do so to discredit the very concept of them."},"1801":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's have a look at few important examples:"},"1804":{"dur":2,"text":"First of course is 'racism' itself."},"1807":{"dur":3,"text":"I strongly suggest that you never use this term in any context."},"1811":{"dur":3,"text":"If you must however make an explicit reference to the problem,"},"1814":{"dur":3,"text":"then simply replace 'racism' with the term 'ethnic conflict',"},"1818":{"dur":3,"text":"as that implies a certain sense of mutuality."},"1822":{"dur":2,"text":"What about the race concept then?"},"1824":{"dur":1,"text":"This one is difficult as well."},"1826":{"dur":2,"text":"While there is enough evidence to suggest,"},"1829":{"dur":3,"text":"that there are meaningful differences between human populations,"},"1832":{"dur":4,"text":"that doesn't mean that you should attempt to resurrect the race concept itself."},"1837":{"dur":2,"text":"But that is actually besides the point."},"1840":{"dur":2,"text":"We don't need races for people to be different!"},"1842":{"dur":3,"text":"Just because the colours in the rainbow blend into each other,"},"1846":{"dur":3,"text":"that doesn't invalidate the concept of different colours."},"1849":{"dur":2,"text":"And that is what people are truly interested in:"},"1852":{"dur":3,"text":"we don't really care if someone belongs to a certain 'race'."},"1855":{"dur":4,"text":"What we really want to know is if someone is fundamentally different from us."},"1860":{"dur":1,"text":"So bottom line is:"},"1861":{"dur":4,"text":"that at least in the Western world, this term seems beyond recovery."},"1865":{"dur":6,"text":"It is impossible to use it in any context without having to deal with extremely negative connotations,"},"1872":{"dur":3,"text":"so for both scientific and tactical reasons,"},"1876":{"dur":1,"text":"avoid it altogether."},"1877":{"dur":4,"text":"Instead, try to use peoples or the more formal term 'populations'."},"1882":{"dur":4,"text":"Other alternative terms I quite like are 'native' or 'indigenous',"},"1886":{"dur":2,"text":"as they imply a biological component."},"1890":{"dur":3,"text":"Finally, try to avoid terms that use superficial attributes,"},"1893":{"dur":2,"text":"such as those referring to skin colour,"},"1895":{"dur":2,"text":"as they will make your arguments look shallow as well."},"1899":{"dur":2,"text":"By using a different vocabulary,"},"1901":{"dur":2,"text":"you should try to assert your own narrative,"},"1903":{"dur":2,"text":"a different world-view in place of the mainstream."},"1906":{"dur":1,"text":"Like in that movie 'The Cell'."},"1908":{"dur":5,"text":"Where plot involved a scenario where the protagonist had to travel into the mind of a psychopath"},"1913":{"dur":2,"text":"to discover the location of his latest victim."},"1916":{"dur":1,"text":"But the problem was,"},"1918":{"dur":3,"text":"that while she trapped in his mind and in his dream,"},"1921":{"dur":2,"text":"it was impossible for her challenge him."},"1924":{"dur":3,"text":"The way they solved this was to change the dreamer to the heroine,"},"1928":{"dur":1,"text":"and your job is the same."},"1930":{"dur":2,"text":"It is to break out from their story"},"1932":{"dur":1,"text":"and establish yours."},"1933":{"dur":2,"text":"Let them be the villain in Your story."},"1937":{"dur":1,"text":"So to summarise:"},"1938":{"dur":3,"text":"If you stop playing their game, then you can stop being the villain!"},"1942":{"dur":3,"text":"If it's your world, then it's your rules!"},"1945":{"dur":3,"text":"Start all your answers with \"there is no such thing as a\","},"1948":{"dur":2,"text":"then by choosing your words very carefully,"},"1951":{"dur":2,"text":"assert your own narrative."},"1954":{"dur":2,"text":"I cannot possibly cover all of the different scenarios"},"1957":{"dur":3,"text":"and provide a comprehensive guide on how to deal with each a situation."},"1960":{"dur":5,"text":"Also, I don't think that having a single 'mantra' that you could just mindlessly repeat would work either."},"1966":{"dur":1,"text":"Mantras are not flexible"},"1968":{"dur":3,"text":"and since they never change your opponents will quickly learn them"},"1971":{"dur":4,"text":"and then develop an immunity which will then allow them to easily quarantine you away."},"1977":{"dur":4,"text":"What you want to do, is to make your own local adaptation of the following template:"},"1982":{"dur":2,"text":"\"There is no such thing as Racism."},"1984":{"dur":4,"text":"The concept of Racism is defined as the moral failure of treating people differently"},"1988":{"dur":2,"text":"whom we believe to be the

exist.\""},"1998":{"dur":4,"text":"Now of course this is not what you would actually say, but this is what you should mean."},"2002":{"dur":3,"text":"How you actually say it will depend on the current scenario."},"2005":{"dur":4,"text":"In fact in most situations, you wouldn't need to do much more than to simply roll your eyes"},"2010":{"dur":2,"text":"and that should express the same thing."},"2012":{"dur":2,"text":"The point is to discredit the concept itself."},"2015":{"dur":3,"text":"It's about making the term 'Racism' loose its currency."},"2018":{"dur":3,"text":"At the end, it should have no weight when thrown around."},"2021":{"dur":4,"text":"You will just need to find the most effective and practical way of achieving that."},"2026":{"dur":3,"text":"At a science conference of course you would need to have done more homework"},"2029":{"dur":2,"text":"and be prepared with some citations."},"2032":{"dur":4,"text":"In a philosophical debate, you could draw on part two of this presentation,"},"2036":{"dur":3,"text":"plus do more reading of the works Nietzsche for example."},"2040":{"dur":2,"text":"Having said that, before we wrap this up,"},"2042":{"dur":3,"text":"I would like share a few practical tips that should help you to get started."},"2047":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's take things in order."},"2049":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's start with a science themed practical scenario:"},"2052":{"dur":5,"text":"In the coming years, as the last remnants of any scientific credibility of egalitarianism"},"2057":{"dur":3,"text":"are going to be eroded by modern research, it will become less and less likely"},"2061":{"dur":3,"text":"that your opponent should choose science to support his arguments."},"2065":{"dur":4,"text":"But today, it is still very much possible that they will first attempt to make a scientific claim,"},"2070":{"dur":2,"text":"similar to those you've seen in part one."},"2073":{"dur":1,"text":"There are two basic possibilities:"},"2075":{"dur":4,"text":"The first one is that they will make broad scientific claims without any evidence"},"2079":{"dur":5,"text":"that science has long proven that we are all the same, but only really to support their underlying morality."},"2085":{"dur":2,"text":"Against this, you should first point this out,"},"2087":{"dur":4,"text":"that they are in fact not making a scientific argument, that they are really just applying a morality."},"2092":{"dur":5,"text":"To finish them off, you should try to draw a parallel between creationism and liberal beliefs in equality."},"2098":{"dur":3,"text":"This shouldn't be difficult as they really are the same thing."},"2102":{"dur":3,"text":"Second, if they really are trying to make a science based argument."},"2106":{"dur":3,"text":"Well then you should be well prepared with your own list of facts."},"2109":{"dur":2,"text":"This should not be too difficult either,"},"2111":{"dur":4,"text":"as there is now plenty of good research in the public domain that you could draw on."},"2116":{"dur":4,"text":"Next up, is the moral or philosophical debate."},"2120":{"dur":3,"text":"As a philosophical debate is inherently non-practical,"},"2123":{"dur":3,"text":"there isn't much I could say here, just refer back part two."},"2126":{"dur":2,"text":"You could also draw on Nietzsche's works,"},"2128":{"dur":5,"text":"especially where he deals with systems of values and the importance of who defines morality,"},"2133":{"dur":6,"text":"as essentially what you will be disagreeing on are the very definitions of what it means to be good or evil."},"2140":{"dur":6,"text":"In practice, it is quite unlikely that you would have to engage in a full frontal philosophical confrontation,"},"2147":{"dur":3,"text":"but it is quite possible, that your opponents will use a mixed strategy,"},"2151":{"dur":4,"text":"where they would use a moral coating on their otherwise practical or scientific arguments."},"2156":{"dur":2,"text":"To deal with this, this is my suggestion:"},"2159":{"dur":4,"text":"First, point out that their morality is based on scientific falsehoods."},"2163":{"dur":5,"text":"and as such, a morality based on falsehoods must therefore be a false morality."},"2168":{"dur":2,"text":"Try to avoid sounding too 'sciency' though."},"2171":{"dur":2,"text":"People who make decisions based on moral principles"},"2174":{"dur":2,"text":"aren't always impressed by what is actually true."},"2177":{"dur":1,"text":"In that case,"},"2178":{"dur":4,"text":"try to show that equality and true human development are antitheses of each other."},"2184":{"dur":4,"text":"The point is as always: is to discredit the concept

effort."},"2195":{"dur":2,"text":"The fact that you are no longer believing"},"2197":{"dur":2,"text":"in the modern day equivalent of 'witches' and 'heretics'."},"2200":{"dur":2,"text":"That you are no longer spellbound to this morality,"},"2203":{"dur":2,"text":"will be obvious no matter what you say."},"2205":{"dur":3,"text":"Ultimately this is going to be the most important arena,"},"2209":{"dur":5,"text":"as real change will only happen once a critical mass of individuals will stop believing in 'racism'"},"2215":{"dur":4,"text":"and that is much more likely to happen in a pub or in the living room than anywhere else."},"2220":{"dur":1,"text":"Just think about it."},"2221":{"dur":5,"text":"A 100 years from now, calling someone a 'racist' will have same effect as calling someone a heretic,"},"2227":{"dur":1,"text":"witch or kulak today"},"2229":{"dur":5,"text":"and will be seen in the historical context as essentially a different version of the same thing."},"2234":{"dur":2,"text":"When you are with a close friend,"},"2236":{"dur":3,"text":"you can pretend that this has already happened and eventually,"},"2240":{"dur":2,"text":"it will happen for

back-track never works either,"},"2251":{"dur":4,"text":"because it will look like an admission of guilt and they will never let you off the hook anyway."},"2256":{"dur":2,"text":"Just stick to your guns, and fight it out."},"2260":{"dur":2,"text":"So we have reached the end of this presentation,"},"2262":{"dur":1,"text":"where to go from here?"},"2264":{"dur":4,"text":"Practice makes perfect, so I recommend that you organise into small groups,"},"2269":{"dur":2,"text":"where the following  scenarios could be played out:"},"2271":{"dur":3,"text":"Science conference, TV show, at a dinner
