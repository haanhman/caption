{"7":{"dur":1,"text":"Can everyone hear me okay?"},"9":{"dur":0,"text":"Great."},"10":{"dur":5,"text":"So, what I wanted to talk to you guys about today was a little bit"},"16":{"dur":3,"text":"about what we do at Planet Labs and why and a little bit of some"},"20":{"dur":3,"text":"of the lessons I've learned on this entrepreneurial journey,"},"23":{"dur":1,"text":"if you like, for others that are interested"},"25":{"dur":2,"text":"in taking similar journeys."},"28":{"dur":1,"text":"I hope it will be useful,"},"30":{"dur":2,"text":"but much of it will be from my personal perspective,"},"32":{"dur":2,"text":"so take it with that grain of salt."},"34":{"dur":3,"text":"I want to start us here, this is called the Earth."},"38":{"dur":2,"text":"You may have seen it before."},"40":{"dur":2,"text":"You may have seen it before in particular,"},"42":{"dur":4,"text":"because of this rather iconic image that the Apollo 17 astronauts"},"47":{"dur":3,"text":"took when they were hurtling around the moon in 1972."},"50":{"dur":3,"text":"It was the first full -- first full frame image of the"},"54":{"dur":5,"text":"entire planet when it was fully sunlit and it's credited"},"59":{"dur":2,"text":"with having started the green movement,"},"61":{"dur":2,"text":"but not so much because we didn't know we were living on"},"64":{"dur":4,"text":"a planet before then or at least most people thought we did."},"68":{"dur":4,"text":"It is the case though that it hadn't really gone into the public"},"73":{"dur":3,"text":"consciousness and this changed a lot of peoples thinking,"},"77":{"dur":1,"text":"this particular photograph,"},"78":{"dur":2,"text":"because they saw the thin shadow of the atmosphere,"},"80":{"dur":3,"text":"they saw the Earth in the vastness of space and made people realize"},"84":{"dur":2,"text":"that we've got to take care of this beautiful planet that we're on."},"88":{"dur":3,"text":"But beautiful as this picture is, it's a little bit lacking."},"91":{"dur":3,"text":"It's lacking because it's static and the Earth is constantly changing"},"96":{"dur":6,"text":"as we -- in particular affect the planet as human beings and what"},"102":{"dur":5,"text":"one would ideally like is much more high-cadence imagery,"},"107":{"dur":1,"text":"high-frequency imagery of the planet."},"109":{"dur":2,"text":"So satellite imagery today is typically old."},"112":{"dur":3,"text":"The imagery you find online is typically several years old."},"116":{"dur":1,"text":"So we did a thought experiment."},"118":{"dur":1,"text":"What would it be like,"},"119":{"dur":2,"text":"if we could take a high-resolution image of every single"},"122":{"dur":2,"text":"point on the Earth's surface, every single day."},"125":{"dur":2,"text":"What could we do with that data?"},"129":{"dur":2,"text":"We were thinking well, we could track deforestation."},"132":{"dur":2,"text":"We could see that as it happens rather than waking"},"134":{"dur":1,"text":"up at the end of the year and realizing there is"},"136":{"dur":2,"text":"a bloody great hole in the Amazon again."},"139":{"dur":3,"text":"We could catch people in the act as the"},"142":{"dur":2,"text":"logging takes place over many weeks."},"145":{"dur":2,"text":"We could do the same for fisheries."},"147":{"dur":3,"text":"We could see disasters like the situation happening in Nepal"},"151":{"dur":3,"text":"right now and help people quickly get the imagery they need"},"154":{"dur":3,"text":"to figure out how to respond to those situations."},"158":{"dur":4,"text":"Same with floods, fires, earthquakes -- well that is an earthquake,"},"162":{"dur":1,"text":"other disasters as well."},"165":{"dur":3,"text":"We would also be able to help people improve agricultural yield,"},"168":{"dur":2,"text":"because with satellite data you can"},"171":{"dur":3,"text":"tell biomass in every single pixel,"},"174":{"dur":2,"text":"and so we could help people improve agriculture around the world."},"176":{"dur":2,"text":"And then there are a lot of commercial applications for example,"},"179":{"dur":3,"text":"having up-to-date imagery is something that people want on their consumer"},"183":{"dur":3,"text":"mapping products and so if everyone wants that on their phone,"},"186":{"dur":1,"text":"instead of an image several years old,"},"187":{"dur":2,"text":"they want the image from recently and there"},"190":{"dur":2,"text":"is lots of financial applications as well."},"192":{"dur":3,"text":"And so me and my co-founders who were at NASA at the time"},"196":{"dur":2,"text":"left NASA to start a company to try and tackle that problem"},"199":{"dur":2,"text":"of trying to get to daily imaging of the planet."},"201":{"dur":4,"text":"And so that was the mission we set out, image the whole Earth,"},"206":{"dur":4,"text":"every single day and provide universal access to that imagery."},"212":{"dur":2,"text":"And so roughly what does that take?"},"214":{"dur":1,"text":"It takes a system like this."},"216":{"dur":3,"text":"We need about a 150 satellites orbiting"},"219":{"dur":1,"text":"the Earth in a particular orbit."},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"We need a system of 30 ground stations all round the world"},"223":{"dur":2,"text":"to receive the information down from those satellites."},"226":{"dur":2,"text":"We need of course large numbers of processors in"},"229":{"dur":4,"text":"order to digest and make that information calibrated"},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"and georectified onto the Earth's surface,"},"236":{"dur":1,"text":"so that it's useful for consumers."},"238":{"dur":2,"text":"And then we thought about two ways of sort"},"240":{"dur":1,"text":"of provisioning that out to customers."},"242":{"dur":5,"text":"One, via sort of feed hoses to large enterprise users,"},"248":{"dur":4,"text":"say those consumer mapping clients that I was talking about,"},"252":{"dur":2,"text":"but also we wanted to get it out on a platform"},"254":{"dur":2,"text":"so that everyone could have access to it."},"256":{"dur":2,"text":"So we have an open API where anyone can come and hack"},"259":{"dur":3,"text":"their own apps on our imagery, on our servers."},"262":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's roughly what we set out to do."},"266":{"dur":3,"text":"This little video is going to show you how it would work."},"269":{"dur":3,"text":"So we put 150 satellites into a sun-synchronous plane,"},"273":{"dur":1,"text":"that -- they're all in the same plane."},"275":{"dur":1,"text":"And they actually stay fixed,"},"276":{"dur":1,"text":"that plane stays fixed with respect to the"},"277":{"dur":2,"text":"sun and the Earth rotates underneath it."},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"Each one is pointing down and taking a strip of imagery"},"283":{"dur":3,"text":"along the ground and then by the time the next one comes"},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"along the Earth is rotated just the width of the image."},"289":{"dur":3,"text":"So that it stripes the part just next to it."},"293":{"dur":3,"text":"It ends up being like a line scanner for the planet."},"296":{"dur":5,"text":"So basically the Earth does the legwork and we just stay put"},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"and let the Earth rotate underneath it and slowly scan it,"},"304":{"dur":1,"text":"a line scanner for the planet."},"305":{"dur":2,"text":"This is two of our satellites being deployed"},"308":{"dur":1,"text":"from the International Space Station."},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"It gives you a bit of a sense of scale of how small our satellites"},"312":{"dur":3,"text":"are versus the solar arrays of the space station."},"316":{"dur":4,"text":"And I'm going to tell a little bit is that -- about what"},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"it took to get there and some of the journey first."},"323":{"dur":3,"text":"So we started this in our garage as Silicon"},"327":{"dur":3,"text":"Valley start-ups are want to do."},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"But I think we were the first space start-up to do that."},"333":{"dur":3,"text":"We literally built our first satellite in our garage and that"},"337":{"dur":2,"text":"wasn't the only lesson we learned from Silicon Valley."},"339":{"dur":4,"text":"We took an approach of rapid iteration, we call it agile aerospace."},"344":{"dur":3,"text":"I'll tell you a little bit more about that in a minute."},"347":{"dur":3,"text":"We try to just take things out into the field and test them;"},"351":{"dur":1,"text":"we would take our satellites out."},"352":{"dur":4,"text":"We'd fire them in planes over our ground stations to check they work,"},"356":{"dur":3,"text":"have the radio tests along across the Valley"},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"from here to basically the Lick Observatory,"},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"we would send somebody up there and try and to"},"365":{"dur":1,"text":"do a link and make sure everything worked."},"367":{"dur":3,"text":"So we took this sort of more hands-on and testing approach,"},"370":{"dur":3,"text":"which is quite different from the aerospace sector"},"373":{"dur":3,"text":"which takes a very hardcore analytical approach to"},"377":{"dur":4,"text":"finding problems and risks to the satellite design."},"382":{"dur":1,"text":"So we started in our garage and that"},"384":{"dur":3,"text":"was just over three years ago, 3.5 years ago,"},"387":{"dur":4,"text":"and we -- actually the founders of our company"},"391":{"dur":3,"text":"we all met at the United Nations at a conference that"},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"was looking at how to use satellites to help humanity?"},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"How can we bring them to help people in developing countries,"},"401":{"dur":1,"text":"help stop disasters, things like that?"},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"And so this in many ways has been the uniting theme throughout"},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"our careers so we've known each other for about 15 years"},"409":{"dur":4,"text":"before starting this company and so we were long-term friends"},"413":{"dur":3,"text":"and cared about this overarching mission."},"417":{"dur":1,"text":"So what was standing in our way?"},"419":{"dur":1,"text":"The first thing that was standing in our"},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"way was that satellites look like this."},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"You see these people, they're rather big the satellites,"},"427":{"dur":1,"text":"either that or the people are very small."},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"So these satellites weigh about six tons,"},"432":{"dur":1,"text":"this is a Landsat satellite."},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"It was launched last year by NASA."},"436":{"dur":3,"text":"This is what a traditional Earth imaging satellite looks like."},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"So it weighs six tons."},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"It's 4x4x6 meters."},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"It costs $855 million."},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"It was launched on a single rocket."},"450":{"dur":4,"text":"And satellites like this have done a tremendous service"},"454":{"dur":3,"text":"in helping us to understand the planet so far."},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is -- this sort of satellite has given"},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"us reliable data over the last 40 years."},"461":{"dur":3,"text":"But if you want to put up 150 satellites,"},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"this model doesn't really work,"},"467":{"dur":3,"text":"because well at least not unless you have a gigantic budget."},"471":{"dur":3,"text":"But that doesn't really represent the forefront of satellite technology"},"475":{"dur":3,"text":"at least small satellite technology which really was represented"},"479":{"dur":4,"text":"prior to us at least by these folks at Surrey Satellites,"},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"who are actually from the U.K."},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"and these are some of their satellites that they build,"},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"a rapid eye is the constellation of satellites that"},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"they built here shown and these satellites are about"},"494":{"dur":4,"text":"100 kilograms and commensurately less money,"},"499":{"dur":3,"text":"only say $30 million or $40 million."},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"But even that for us was that not going to work."},"507":{"dur":3,"text":"We needed to put up 150 of these guys and even by that standard it was"},"510":{"dur":3,"text":"going to be billions of dollars and not something we could get venture"},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"capital funded let alone try and start out of our own pockets,"},"516":{"dur":1,"text":"which is what we wanted to do."},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"So what we did was make satellites much smaller and this"},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"is actually one of our satellites under construction by one"},"524":{"dur":3,"text":"of our engineers to give you a bit of sense of scale."},"528":{"dur":3,"text":"So our satellites -- this is actually one of them, what it looks like."},"531":{"dur":3,"text":"One of the dominant features you can see is actually,"},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"we have an artist in residence who paints all of our satellites"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"and this is actually the top side of the solar array,"},"541":{"dur":1,"text":"so you can't see the main solar array obviously"},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"that has to have the solar cells on it,"},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"but the artist gets to paint the other parts,"},"548":{"dur":0,"text":"which is kind of cool."},"549":{"dur":1,"text":"But what's inside that?"},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"So we've miniaturized a massive amount"},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"of technology into this little volume."},"555":{"dur":3,"text":"These satellites are 10x10x30 centimeters."},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"They use what's called the CubeSat form factor,"},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"which actually Stanford engineers were involved"},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"with pioneering in the late 90s."},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"It's basically a standard form factor of size of a satellite."},"570":{"dur":5,"text":"And launch providers got used to this form factor to give --"},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"which enabled us to get more access to space basically."},"579":{"dur":3,"text":"But inside that is first and foremost the largest"},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"telescope we could possibly fit into that volume."},"585":{"dur":3,"text":"So to the front two thirds of the satellite"},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"is essentially the telescope,"},"589":{"dur":3,"text":"which is the optics that you need to get reasonable resolution"},"593":{"dur":4,"text":"imagery of the ground from 400 or 500 kilometers up,"},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"which is where we are orbiting."},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"Then we have a camera system at the back,"},"603":{"dur":4,"text":"which that telescope feeds to and on our latest"},"607":{"dur":3,"text":"generation is a 29 megapixel camera."},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"But in addition to that that's only really just the beginning"},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"what one has to have is obviously the power systems so the"},"617":{"dur":3,"text":"batteries and the solar power to keep them charged."},"621":{"dur":4,"text":"We have to have an attitude determination system so that is the system"},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"that figures out where the satellite is and where it's pointing."},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"So we have a GPS antenna that picks up"},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"that and actually GPS works in space."},"635":{"dur":2,"text":"You might question whether it would or not, but it does."},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"We're that much lower than the GPS satellites, so it still works."},"642":{"dur":5,"text":"And we have a star camera which looks out up whilst the main cameras"},"647":{"dur":4,"text":"looking down and takes pictures of the star field and then automatically"},"652":{"dur":5,"text":"recognizes constellations and then adds metadata to our main image"},"658":{"dur":3,"text":"to say you were pointed this way when you took that image."},"661":{"dur":1,"text":"So we have a timestamp,"},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"the GPS stamp says where it's at in the orbit"},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"and then this the star camera stamp,"},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"if you like, says which way are we pointing at the time?"},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"There is a lot of other sensors in here."},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"There is a three axis accelerometer, three axis rate gyro,"},"676":{"dur":1,"text":"three axis magnetometer;"},"677":{"dur":3,"text":"these all feed into a Kalman filter to spit out"},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"the satellite position and attitude state."},"683":{"dur":6,"text":"Then we have a system of attitude control, so that's what then says,"},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"we now know where we are pointing,"},"691":{"dur":1,"text":"now we need to point somewhere else,"},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"at the ground say if we're pointing up or what have you."},"695":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we have two systems of attitude control,"},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"one is a system of reaction wheels."},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"So these are little brush-less DC motors essentially that were"},"704":{"dur":8,"text":"put in all three axis and if you spin them one way then the satellite"},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"has to spin the other way to conserve momentum and so we can turn"},"716":{"dur":3,"text":"the satellite round just by turning on these motors."},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"We have an independent other system of attitude"},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"control which is using magnetorquer coils."},"724":{"dur":6,"text":"So these are little -- just literally wire -- a system of copper wire that"},"731":{"dur":4,"text":"we put through a little current which creates a little B field,"},"735":{"dur":3,"text":"which reacts against the Earth's really small magnetic field and"},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"gives just enough torque to turn our satellites round as well."},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"So we have two independent means of turning our satellites around."},"745":{"dur":3,"text":"One is completely simple that magnetorquer coil,"},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"very robust, but it's a little bit slower."},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"And so when we're turning for example to point at our ground"},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"station to maximize the gain of our radio antenna,"},"757":{"dur":1,"text":"we use our reaction wheels."},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"But for most of the time we can use our magnetorquer coils."},"762":{"dur":1,"text":"Also in there we have a processor."},"764":{"dur":1,"text":"We actually have three processors,"},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"we have an FPGA which does the initial compression of the imagery."},"768":{"dur":5,"text":"We have a full up x86 processor running Ubuntu,"},"774":{"dur":3,"text":"and then we have also got an ARM processor that does a lot"},"778":{"dur":4,"text":"of the light work scheduling of the satellite operations."},"783":{"dur":3,"text":"And so actually despite being some of the smallest satellites ever,"},"786":{"dur":3,"text":"they are some of the most capable satellites"},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"ever in terms of the compute power on-board."},"792":{"dur":1,"text":"We've got more memory and processing"},"793":{"dur":1,"text":"power than a lot of other satellites,"},"795":{"dur":3,"text":"if not all of them just because we use the latest technology"},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"and stuff it in and we take a slightly higher risk"},"801":{"dur":3,"text":"approach which I'll be talking more about."},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"Then we have a radio systems to send down the data,"},"808":{"dur":3,"text":"so we have three radios on board all of which we developed in-house,"},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"because the cheapest radio we could find that would"},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"do the job was larger than our satellite and,"},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"it costs about $1 million."},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"So it was out of scope on two axes."},"822":{"dur":1,"text":"So we built our own radio in-house"},"823":{"dur":3,"text":"that we have - it has three channels,"},"827":{"dur":5,"text":"a UHF channel, which does the command and control of the satellite,"},"832":{"dur":1,"text":"an S band which is where we send the"},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"data up and an X band which is 8.3"},"836":{"dur":1,"text":"gigahertz to send the data down."},"838":{"dur":3,"text":"We can send our data down at about 40 megabits a second down to"},"841":{"dur":2,"text":"our ground stations around the world and I will show you a little"},"844":{"dur":2,"text":"bit what the ground stations look like in a minute as well."},"847":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's what the satellite looks like."},"849":{"dur":4,"text":"And as I mentioned, we take this sort of agile approach and what"},"853":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean by that is we constantly put in the latest technology."},"857":{"dur":3,"text":"So in between the last two -- the one we just launched"},"861":{"dur":3,"text":"about a month ago today well we launched 14 satellites"},"865":{"dur":2,"text":"and we always put a tech demo satellite on,"},"867":{"dur":2,"text":"testing our next generation technology and then"},"870":{"dur":2,"text":"we put a fleet of ones that we know would work."},"872":{"dur":2,"text":"And then if that one works then we'll just"},"875":{"dur":2,"text":"produce loads of those for the next batch."},"877":{"dur":2,"text":"So the tech demo one we had on this one for example"},"880":{"dur":2,"text":"had double the field of view on the telescope."},"883":{"dur":3,"text":"We had gone up 3X in the number of pixels on the camera."},"886":{"dur":2,"text":"We had doubled the hard drive space on that satellite."},"889":{"dur":1,"text":"We had increased the radio speed."},"891":{"dur":1,"text":"We had put new sensors in that helped"},"893":{"dur":2,"text":"us to do better attitude control,"},"895":{"dur":1,"text":"sun sensors basically."},"896":{"dur":1,"text":"And so we keep on iterating the technology."},"898":{"dur":2,"text":"We call this strapping space to Moore's Law."},"900":{"dur":3,"text":"We're basically trying to leverage the billions of dollars that have"},"903":{"dur":3,"text":"gone into consumer electronics and stuff them into our satellites."},"907":{"dur":4,"text":"And although that seems pretty obvious that's not really"},"912":{"dur":3,"text":"what the space industry has been doing until now."},"915":{"dur":2,"text":"It might be obvious to you and I,"},"918":{"dur":2,"text":"but it's not what has been going on."},"921":{"dur":3,"text":"So basically there is traditionally you can only put something"},"925":{"dur":3,"text":"into space if it has already been tested in space,"},"928":{"dur":3,"text":"which leads to this sort of chicken and egg then everything is antiquated"},"931":{"dur":4,"text":"and there is very long design life cycles for these things,"},"935":{"dur":2,"text":"so they want them to last long times so they want reliable"},"937":{"dur":2,"text":"technology and they design them over many, many years."},"940":{"dur":1,"text":"So what ends up happening is that you end"},"942":{"dur":1,"text":"up launching antiquated technology."},"944":{"dur":3,"text":"So the processors on the latest mission on Mars is -- has"},"947":{"dur":3,"text":"a 33 megahertz processor and a two megapixel camera,"},"951":{"dur":2,"text":"because 20 years ago that was really hot shit."},"953":{"dur":2,"text":"But unfortunately -- yes,"},"955":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean you can't even find a 33 megahertz"},"957":{"dur":2,"text":"processor to go and stick into satellite."},"959":{"dur":2,"text":"They have to keep their own lines of processors"},"962":{"dur":1,"text":"going to keep that stuff going."},"963":{"dur":4,"text":"So we strap our satellites to Moore's Law and then"},"968":{"dur":2,"text":"we really also do another thing that's quite equally"},"971":{"dur":2,"text":"important I think to keep our satellites agile."},"974":{"dur":1,"text":"We keep on uploading new code."},"976":{"dur":3,"text":"Again, pretty obvious to computer programmers"},"979":{"dur":2,"text":"down here on terra firma but,"},"982":{"dur":4,"text":"in the aerospace sector there is always hesitation because"},"986":{"dur":2,"text":"you could put up new code and it could send the satellite"},"988":{"dur":2,"text":"into a spin and there goes $1 billion."},"991":{"dur":2,"text":"So people are scared about doing that and at NASA"},"993":{"dur":1,"text":"we would take -- typically take about a year for us"},"995":{"dur":3,"text":"to get new code uploaded to our satellites."},"998":{"dur":3,"text":"So we just upload new code to our satellites all the time."},"1002":{"dur":2,"text":"We normally we've got a couple going that we"},"1004":{"dur":1,"text":"are more experimental with and if it works,"},"1006":{"dur":2,"text":"we just copy it across the whole fleet."},"1008":{"dur":3,"text":"So we take an agile approach to our software development as well."},"1012":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's that really."},"1015":{"dur":2,"text":"So we take - that's agile aerospace."},"1017":{"dur":2,"text":"Then we had to figure out how to manufacture them at scale"},"1020":{"dur":3,"text":"and I don't mean scale like iPhones or whatever,"},"1023":{"dur":3,"text":"but hundreds is the sort of scale that"},"1026":{"dur":1,"text":"we need to build satellites in."},"1028":{"dur":2,"text":"And we figured out how to do that and that meant"},"1030":{"dur":2,"text":"redesigning the satellite for manufacturability,"},"1033":{"dur":3,"text":"so that everything was plugged together like a ribbon cables rather"},"1036":{"dur":3,"text":"than us wiring it altogether and three axis milled parts rather"},"1040":{"dur":2,"text":"than five axis milled parts so that we could have a shorter timeline"},"1042":{"dur":4,"text":"to get the iterations in and things like that."},"1046":{"dur":3,"text":"So we redesigned them to be able to build them in large numbers."},"1049":{"dur":3,"text":"So in the aerospace sector typically it takes -- the fastest"},"1053":{"dur":2,"text":"people develop a satellite is a year or so."},"1056":{"dur":4,"text":"And we can do it orders of magnitude better than that,"},"1060":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'm not going to tell you the specifics."},"1063":{"dur":1,"text":"Now -- then of course we have to get rides into space."},"1065":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, when we were in our garage,"},"1068":{"dur":3,"text":"we put our first deposit on a launch vehicle with our pocket money,"},"1071":{"dur":2,"text":"so to speak, and -- but when we were getting"},"1074":{"dur":1,"text":"towards the bigger payments,"},"1075":{"dur":1,"text":"that wasn't going to work."},"1077":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's when we went and

which were successful."},"1102":{"dur":3,"text":"I'll tell you about the one that wasn't in a bit."},"1106":{"dur":2,"text":"So we have -- and these were over the last two years."},"1108":{"dur":3,"text":"So we've roughly had a quarterly cadence of launches"},"1112":{"dur":2,"text":"to test our technology and keep on iterating it."},"1115":{"dur":4,"text":"And so every time we have that new generation satellite we put it up,"},"1119":{"dur":2,"text":"but we've also been launching these fleets of satellites,"},"1121":{"dur":2,"text":"so we've now launched 87

window."},"1163":{"dur":3,"text":"I guess they've got nothing better to do."},"1166":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we like seeing this, there's a sort of flash at the end,"},"1169":{"dur":2,"text":"which is kind of fun when it glints in the sun."},"1172":{"dur":4,"text":"I thought we could have planned that."},"1177":{"dur":2,"text":"Here is some of the latest ones that just came

giggles."},"1186":{"dur":2,"text":"So then we have to get the data down,"},"1189":{"dur":2,"text":"so we have a system of ground stations around the world."},"1192":{"dur":1,"text":"We've got about a dozen of these."},"1193":{"dur":4,"text":"So inside that is a 5 meter parabolic dish antenna which points at the"},"1197":{"dur":4,"text":"satellite as it goes ahead and gets the data down and the

each location picking up the data."},"1232":{"dur":5,"text":"So that's obviously how we get the data down."},"1238":{"dur":4,"text":"So then -- well, then we get things like this."},"1243":{"dur":3,"text":"This is one of the first images from the wider field"},"1246":{"dur":1,"text":"of view telescope that I was just mentioning,"},"1248":{"dur":1,"text":"we just launched

space,"},"1284":{"dur":3,"text":"it turns out, but we wouldn't want to do that even if we could."},"1288":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we get images like this."},"1291":{"dur":1,"text":"I will show you a

some of the fascination"},"1700":{"dur":3,"text":"with this particular launch."},"1744":{"dur":4,"text":"So that's one of the challenges we face."},"1748":{"dur":3,"text":"Let me -- if we come back to the -- that's one of the challenges,"},"1752":{"dur":9,"text":"satellite launches can - is that going to come back up, excellent."},"1761":{"dur":4,"text":"Launches can be delayed quite often and

day."},"1772":{"dur":1,"text":"We'd put a lot of effort into it."},"1774":{"dur":1,"text":"That was annoying."},"1776":{"dur":4,"text":"But luckily we had had quite a few launches,"},"1781":{"dur":1,"text":"we had already had four launches that year."},"1783":{"dur":1,"text":"We were doing pretty well."},"1784":{"dur":1,"text":"We had already launched more satellites"},"1785":{"dur":1,"text":"in one year than anyone else in history."},"1787":{"dur":3,"text":"We were doing pretty well and our strategy is put our satellites"},"1790":{"dur":2,"text":"on lots of different launch vehicles and if one blows up,"},"1792":{"dur":1,"text":"it's not the end of the world."},"1793":{"dur":3,"text":"That's part of the advantage of having our satellites be smaller"},"1797":{"dur":4,"text":"and put on more regular launches is that we don't have one big,"},"1801":{"dur":2,"text":"$1 billion satellite and if that explodes,"},"1804":{"dur":4,"text":"that really is the end of the world."},"1808":{"dur":0,"text":"So that happens."},"1809":{"dur":2,"text":"And I just wanted to talk about some of the challenges"},"1812":{"dur":1,"text":"only because I thought they might be useful."},"1813":{"dur":5,"text":"We obviously -- one of the key risk areas we weren't sure about as we started"},"1819":{"dur":3,"text":"the company was were we going to able to get the regulatory approval to"},"1822":{"dur":3,"text":"launch these satellites and operate these satellites in space?"},"1826":{"dur":5,"text":"One thing if you're borrowing and building this $1 billion satellite"},"1831":{"dur":3,"text":"and you can pay tens of millions of dollars to some lawyers in DC or"},"1834":{"dur":3,"text":"whatever to lobby to get some approvals or whatever that goes on."},"1838":{"dur":3,"text":"We weren't sure as a small start-up how we were going"},"1841":{"dur":2,"text":"to be treated and how it was going to work."},"1843":{"dur":4,"text":"But luckily the good news there is that we really"},"1848":{"dur":2,"text":"did manage to get all the licenses and approvals."},"1850":{"dur":2,"text":"We had to get three kinds of licenses for our satellites,"},"1853":{"dur":2,"text":"the NOAA licenses to take images of the Earth,"},"1855":{"dur":5,"text":"we have to get FCC licenses and ITU licenses to broadcast in these particular"},"1860":{"dur":3,"text":"radio channels to ensure we don't interfere with other satellites in"},"1864":{"dur":4,"text":"terms of the RF frequencies and we also get - have to get State Department"},"1868":{"dur":4,"text":"approval to send the satellites abroad for launch when we are sending"},"1873":{"dur":3,"text":"them abroad for launch because State Department considers them munitions"},"1876":{"dur":3,"text":"when -- if you think about that rocket maybe that's true."},"1879":{"dur":2,"text":"Although we call our satellites Doves,"},"1881":{"dur":2,"text":"so we don't think of them as munitions at all."},"1884":{"dur":3,"text":"We think of them as having a peaceful mission, but there we go."},"1888":{"dur":2,"text":"Actually there is a fun story about the Doves,"},"1890":{"dur":4,"text":"that was named by one of our engineers and he was -- what he"},"1895":{"dur":4,"text":"was thinking about there was the fact that in aerospace there"},"1899":{"dur":1,"text":"is a lot of people call their satellites after birds,"},"1901":{"dur":1,"text":"but normally birds of prey."},"1903":{"dur":4,"text":"So Eagle Eye or Kestrel swoop kill this,"},"1907":{"dur":4,"text":"whatever, Eye Spy that and we had a humanitarian"},"1912":{"dur":0,"text":"mission for our satellites,"},"1913":{"dur":1,"text":"so we thought we would take the piss out"},"1915":{"dur":2,"text":"of the military and called them Doves."},"1917":{"dur":3,"text":"So a bit of a fun anecdote there."},"1920":{"dur":1,"text":"One of the other challenges,"},"1922":{"dur":5,"text":"perhaps this is the most important one really is the sheer engineering --"},"1927":{"dur":5,"text":"systems engineering complexity of what we have tried to undertake."},"1933":{"dur":1,"text":"This is not a Yo app."},"1935":{"dur":2,"text":"It turns out there's quite some differences."},"1938":{"dur":4,"text":"In fact I find the Yo app a mockery on humanity and"},"1942":{"dur":3,"text":"I think the founder of that company does too,"},"1946":{"dur":1,"text":"so we're probably in sync there."},"1947":{"dur":4,"text":"But we have probably a thousand features of our inventory"},"1952":{"dur":4,"text":"and satellite building shop control system that is more"},"1957":{"dur":1,"text":"complicated than that Yo app and probably 10,000"},"1958":{"dur":4,"text":"features of our mission control system that schedules and deploys and"},"1963":{"dur":5,"text":"manages all the satellite operations than that freaking Yo app."},"1969":{"dur":1,"text":"So it is a mockery of humanity,"},"1970":{"dur":2,"text":"but anyway there is a complex system engineering thing."},"1973":{"dur":1,"text":"We have the satellites,"},"1974":{"dur":1,"text":"all those components that I mentioned"},"1976":{"dur":1,"text":"that go in have to all work together,"},"1978":{"dur":2,"text":"and have to work together without any"},"1980":{"dur":1,"text":"human interference right directly."},"1982":{"dur":2,"text":"We can't go up there and press the reset button."},"1984":{"dur":2,"text":"We're really -- once they're launched they're launched and"},"1987":{"dur":2,"text":"so we have to have all these watchdog circuits and all"},"1990":{"dur":2,"text":"of those components have to work together harmoniously,"},"1992":{"dur":1,"text":"then those satellites have to work with each other."},"1994":{"dur":1,"text":"Those satellites then all have to communicate with"},"1996":{"dur":2,"text":"this system of ground stations around the world."},"1998":{"dur":4,"text":"Then there has to be a mission control architecture that schedules"},"2003":{"dur":2,"text":"all those satellites to take pictures or turn to the ground"},"2006":{"dur":4,"text":"station to coordinate all of that and all the bespoke interfaces"},"2010":{"dur":3,"text":"to all the different ground stations and then that's just"},"2014":{"dur":1,"text":"when we get the data down to the ground,"},"2016":{"dur":3,"text":"and then we have to have this fairly sophisticated set"},"2019":{"dur":3,"text":"of programs to turn the data into something useful."},"2023":{"dur":2,"text":"We have to stitch it to the Earth's surface."},"2026":{"dur":4,"text":"So this image comes down with the metadata of here is where I was"},"2030":{"dur":2,"text":"when I took the picture and here is roughly where I was pointing,"},"2032":{"dur":1,"text":"but it still doesn't give it accurately enough,"},"2034":{"dur":1,"text":"so then that's sort of plus or minus"},"2036":{"dur":1,"text":"a 10th of a picture or something."},"2038":{"dur":3,"text":"And then what we do is we scour the Earth for ground control points,"},"2042":{"dur":2,"text":"sharp peaks of mountains,"},"2045":{"dur":4,"text":"buildings, roads, things of that and then find the same thing in each"},"2049":{"dur":4,"text":"image and then rectify them automatically to the Earth's surface."},"2053":{"dur":1,"text":"And doing that whole process,"},"2055":{"dur":2,"text":"colour calibration, atmospheric correction,"},"2057":{"dur":3,"text":"orthorectification that means taking into account the topography,"},"2061":{"dur":2,"text":"the georectification that's what I was just talking about,"},"2064":{"dur":1,"text":"crosscalibration between all these satellites,"},"2066":{"dur":2,"text":"we have this complicated data pipeline."},"2068":{"dur":2,"text":"So just the sheer complexity was really I think the"},"2070":{"dur":3,"text":"thing that was the biggest challenge and still is"},"2074":{"dur":4,"text":"the biggest challenge for us as an organization."},"2078":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's sort of tightly related to the goal we took on,"},"2082":{"dur":1,"text":"but it is pretty hard."},"2084":{"dur":1,"text":"I think finding the right investors,"},"2085":{"dur":2,"text":"we lucked out at many -- in many ways I think."},"2088":{"dur":3,"text":"But I think finding the right investors was really key."},"2091":{"dur":3,"text":"People that really take the long haul view was"},"2095":{"dur":3,"text":"really key and yes are not too prescriptive."},"2098":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean each start-up needs its own way to go."},"2101":{"dur":3,"text":"And of course we are disrupting a big sector"},"2105":{"dur":2,"text":"and there's worries about how they'll react."},"2108":{"dur":3,"text":"So this again was the end-to-end system I just"},"2112":{"dur":2,"text":"want to emphasize the complexity there."},"2115":{"dur":3,"text":"So I wanted to say a few things about some of the"},"2118":{"dur":2,"text":"other aspects of this not related to our progress,"},"2120":{"dur":4,"text":"but just that I think -- the contextual things that we have"},"2124":{"dur":3,"text":"learned that I thought might be interesting to share."},"2128":{"dur":2,"text":"Firstly, the question we often thought of at the"},"2131":{"dur":2,"text":"beginning was why hasn't anyone done this?"},"2134":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think it's useful to reflect on that just because it helps"},"2137":{"dur":3,"text":"you think of what might be good other ideas to pursue."},"2140":{"dur":3,"text":"So and we think that there were sort of three major reasons."},"2143":{"dur":1,"text":"One was the technology readiness."},"2145":{"dur":3,"text":"So I mean, we leveraged a lot of technology that people have"},"2149":{"dur":3,"text":"been spending billions of dollars compressing sensor systems"},"2152":{"dur":2,"text":"into these devices and we leverage a lot of that."},"2155":{"dur":2,"text":"We don't have phones in our satellites although we"},"2157":{"dur":2,"text":"did when we were at NASA put some phones in space,"},"2160":{"dur":2,"text":"that's another story."},"2162":{"dur":2,"text":"We leveraged a lot of the sensor systems though."},"2165":{"dur":1,"text":"The accelerometers, the rate gyros,"},"2167":{"dur":2,"text":"the magnetometers, all of that stuff that's been stuffed in here,"},"2169":{"dur":1,"text":"the little GPS sensors,"},"2171":{"dur":5,"text":"the little and low power processing ARM chips and so forth."},"2176":{"dur":1,"text":"So we leveraged a lot of that."},"2178":{"dur":4,"text":"And simply

boat load of water."},"2332":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's pretty cool for ultimate human exploration,"},"2336":{"dur":1,"text":"because the moon is the obvious place to

wanted to have a more practical application,"},"2358":{"dur":2,"text":"so we wanted to turn our attention to something a little"},"2361":{"dur":3,"text":"bit more focused on the Earth and as I mentioned the"},"2365":{"dur":1,"text":"founders of the company we all met at the UN."},"2367":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's a little bit about my career."},"2369":{"dur":1,"text":"We did put these

I really, really mean it."},"2415":{"dur":2,"text":"Like it is so pointless just going out"},"2417":{"dur":2,"text":"there to make cash or some other thing,"},"2420":{"dur":2,"text":"and so many people have ideas,"},"2422":{"dur":1,"text":"but you've really got to think about whether"},"2424":{"dur":1,"text":"or not it's a really good idea."},"2426":{"dur":2,"text":"And something that's going to be differentiating"},"2428":{"dur":1,"text":"over what everyone else is doing."},"2430":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'd really encourage you to wait until"},"2433":{"dur":1,"text":"you have a very compelling idea."},"2435":{"dur":2,"text":"Don't just do an idea so as soon as you have an idea."},"2438":{"dur":3,"text":"Like wait until its one that you think it's not a question"},"2441":{"dur":2,"text":"of whether I might want to do this, I have to do this."},"2444":{"dur":2,"text":"The timing is right, the everything is right,"},"2447":{"dur":3,"text":"unless that

go away, take a year off, travel around the world,"},"2456":{"dur":1,"text":"get some inspiration, do something else."},"2457":{"dur":2,"text":"Don't start a start-up, because once you start a

you're doing something completely pointless like a Yo app."},"2472":{"dur":4,"text":"And so like do something meaningful to help the world."},"2476":{"dur":5,"text":"Like don't, don't at all budge on that constraint is my advice."},"2481":{"dur":1,"text":"I've got some other things."},"2483":{"dur":0,"text":"Don't do an MBA."},"2484":{"dur":4,"text":"I don't see any advantage to

right."},"2547":{"dur":2,"text":"Well there is lots of other mechanisms,"},"2549":{"dur":3,"text":"and I think it's worth thinking laterally"},"2553":{"dur":1,"text":"about what one is

say I'm going to do this,"},"2612":{"dur":2,"text":"this and this and it's going to change the world."},"2615":{"dur":4,"text":"How about instead do it and then show people how it's useful"},"2619":{"dur":3,"text":"and then they will appreciate it so much more I think."},"2623":{"dur":2,"text":"So don't set yourself up for failure."},"2625":{"dur":1,"text":"That is the other reason not to do that,"},"2627":{"dur":2,"text":"but I think generally having humility is a good thing."},"2629":{"dur":4,"text":"So I have a slide which relates to raising

compelling."},"2686":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, not every start-up maybe has"},"2688":{"dur":2,"text":"satellites and that's kind of fun,"},"2690":{"dur":3,"text":"but there must be something else you

satellites,"},"3297":{"dur":1,"text":"there is lots of different things."},"3299":{"dur":3,"text":"I think we might be interested in doing that in the long haul,"},"3303":{"dur":2,"text":"but right

launched"},"3413":{"dur":2,"text":"which are bus-sized satellites costing billions of dollars,"},"3416":{"dur":1,"text":"like the one you saw,"},"3417":{"dur":2,"text":"the limit of the size of the optic is limited by"},"3419":{"dur":2,"text":"the size of the rocket that is carrying them."},"3422":{"dur":2,"text":"And that is normally 4 to 5 meters wide."},"3425":{"dur":1,"text":"And even if you take that,"},"3426":{"dur":2,"text":"you can only get down to sort of 10 centimeter"},"3429":{"dur":3,"text":"resolutions or 10 centimeter pixels."},"3432":{"dur":1,"text":"With 10 centimeters pixels you can't see someone."},"3434":{"dur":2,"text":"So even with those bigger satellites you"},"3437":{"dur":2,"text":"can't really see or identify people."},"3439":{"dur":2,"text":"That doesn't mean you can't do some things like track vehicles."},"3442":{"dur":2,"text":"So there is not like the zero implications for privacy,"},"3445":{"dur":3,"text":"but I think it's extraordinarily difficult to get to that sort"},"3448":{"dur":5,"text":"of level that would be necessary to actually identify people."},"3454":{"dur":0,"text":"Yes?"},"3455":{"dur":4,"text":"You mentioned that you've previously

space debris."},"3472":{"dur":3,"text":"So that was why we began the company."},"3476":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes, so what happens is that,"},"3477":{"dur":3,"text":"that -- the space debris is a real problem and there's about 30 million"},"3481":{"dur":2,"text":"pieces of orbital space debris orbiting the Earth today,"},"3483":{"dur":3,"text":"manmade debris of which -- most of which we can't track even,"},"3487":{"dur":1,"text":"it's too small to track."},"3488":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's a real problem and in particular above about 800 kilometers"},"3493":{"dur":2,"text":"between 800 and 1200 kilometers where the main density is,"},"3496":{"dur":3,"text":"where most people have put their satellites over some of history,"},"3499":{"dur":4,"text":"it's got so dense that now there's a runaway cascade"},"3504":{"dur":2,"text":"where the collisions between debris and satellites"},"3507":{"dur":2,"text":"and debris and debris are creating more debris,"},"3509":{"dur":2,"text":"because every time they collide they create lots"},"3512":{"dur":2,"text":"of little bits then the debris is coming down,"},"3515":{"dur":2,"text":"such that we're in a runaway cascade in that thing."},"3517":{"dur":1,"text":"It's called the Kessler syndrome."},"3518":{"dur":3,"text":"We keep our satellites way below that like 400 to"},"3522":{"dur":2,"text":"500 kilometers where there is enough atmospheric"},"3524":{"dur":1,"text":"drag that it just pulls the satellites down."},"3526":{"dur":2,"text":"So the simple answer is that they just come down really quickly"},"3529":{"dur":3,"text":"and they can't possibly contribute to this long-term challenge."},"3533":{"dur":3,"text":"But we would love eventually to try and mitigate"},"3536":{"dur":3,"text":"that problem that's up higher altitude, because if we don't,"},"3540":{"dur":2,"text":"we'll have a serious dilemma on our hands"},"3542":{"dur":2,"text":"about utilizing space in the long haul."},"3544":{"dur":2,"text":"A bit like climate change the sooner you nip it"},"3546":{"dur":2,"text":"in the bud the better and so when I was at NASA,"},"3549":{"dur":1,"text":"I was working on schemes to try and do"},"3550":{"dur":1,"text":"the nipping in the bud if you like."},"3552":{"dur":4,"text":"You mean they fall randomly back to Earth?"},"3557":{"dur":1,"text":"You mean our satellites?"},"3558":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, they decay in a fairly predictable way based on the altitude"},"3563":{"dur":4,"text":"and sort of the atmosphere has an exponential density with altitude"},"3568":{"dur":3,"text":"and so well depending on the altitude we put them that,"},"3572":{"dur":2,"text":"we know pretty well how long they're going to last."},"3574":{"dur":1,"text":"It also depends of course which way we're pointed."},"3576":{"dur":2,"text":"And I assume they burn up?"},"3578":{"dur":1,"text":"And they burn up in the upper atmosphere."},"3580":{"dur":1,"text":"They don't fall to Earth?"},"3581":{"dur":1,"text":"No, they do not fall on people's heads."},"3582":{"dur":2,"text":"I have to worry about them hitting me on the head."},"3585":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm going to guess that all of you found this absolutely inspiring."},"3588":{"dur":2,"text":"Please join me in welcoming Will Marshall."}}
