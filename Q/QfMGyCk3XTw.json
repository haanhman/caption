will go on and on."},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"It's an endless debate"},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"and there's no conclusive,\nsingle answer to it."},"500":{"dur":1,"text":"But if you're a geek like

they've kind of crashed the party"},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"and loosened up\nthe dress code of innovation."},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"659":{"dur":3,"text":"So here are the winners of a
