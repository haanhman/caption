me,"},"1148":{"dur":2,"text":"they said, oh, well,\nwe learned about this at conferences."},"1151":{"dur":1,"text":"We've learned about this in other places."},"1152":{"dur":1,"text":"Or we've read books."},"1154":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's wonderful."},"1156":{"dur":3,"text":"And I feel really blessed that I\nwas a part of that experience,,"},"1159":{"dur":4,"text":"but a part of me was like,

baptized,"},"1185":{"dur":3,"text":"confirmed, receive Eucharist and\nnot living a dynamic life of faith?"},"1189":{"dur":1,"text":"How is that possible?"},"1191":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, he would say there'd\nbe a number of reasons."},"1193":{"dur":1,"text":"A person could lack faith."},"1194":{"dur":1,"text":"They could lack knowledge of the faith."},"1196":{"dur":1,"text":"They could be in sin."},"1198":{"dur":0,"text":"They could be trapped in fear."},"1199":{"dur":4,"text":"So there could be a number of reasons why\na person could receive the sacraments but"},"1203":{"dur":2,"text":"not living a dynamic life of faith."},"1206":{"dur":4,"text":"So St. Thomas Aquinas would go on to say,\nhe would say that what the individual"},"1210":{"dur":2,"text":"has experienced is they've experienced\nthe sacraments validly but"},"1213":{"dur":3,"text":"the grace of that sacrament is dormant,\nit's asleep."},"1217":{"dur":3,"text":"And St. Thomas Aquinas would say that\nthere needs to be a second sending, or"},"1220":{"dur":5,"text":"a resending, that awakens, or\nreleases is the language he uses, this"},"1226":{"dur":4,"text":"grace that was given to us, a baptism or\nconfirmation or every time we go to mass."},"1231":{"dur":3,"text":"This resending, I think,\nis the baptism on the Holy Spirit."},"1234":{"dur":2,"text":"That we experience the grace\nof the Holy Spirit,"},"1236":{"dur":3,"text":"the grace that was given to us at\nbaptism and confirmation awakens."},"1240":{"dur":3,"text":"And our life is changed once again with\nthis resending of the Holy Spirit."},"1244":{"dur":4,"text":">> To be filled with the Holy Spirit\nis for everyone baptized

of God's love."},"1290":{"dur":4,"text":"That we come to understand more fully\nthat God is love and that God loves us."},"1294":{"dur":2,"text":"That his love is personal,\nthat his love is unconditional."},"1297":{"dur":2,"text":"So we have a deep experience of his love."},"1299":{"dur":3,"text":"But we also experience a peace\nin the midst of confusion or"},"1302":{"dur":1,"text":"frustration or whatever."},"1304":{"dur":2,"text":"A God's peace is present to us."},"1306":{"dur":4,"text":"Another common experience is a greater\nunderstanding of who

me."},"1316":{"dur":1,"text":"That Jesus rose from the dead for me."},"1318":{"dur":1,"text":"That Jesus sent his Holy Spirit upon me so"},"1320":{"dur":3,"text":"that we have a greater understanding and\na greater revelation of Christ."},"1324":{"dur":2,"text":"We experience a greater\npower in the Holy Spirit,"},"1326":{"dur":2,"text":"that the Holy Spirit wants to come and\nhe wants to give us power,"},"1328":{"dur":5,"text":"power over fear, power over sin,\npower over the past, power over struggle."},"1334":{"dur":1,"text":"We experience power in the spiritual life."},"1337":{"dur":2,"text":"Another thing that we experience is\na greater fruit to the Holy Spirit,"},"1339":{"dur":3,"text":"that there's greater joy in our life,\nthere's more love,"},"1343":{"dur":1,"text":"there's more peace, there's more patience."},"1344":{"dur":4,"text":"The Holy Spirit brings all of this and\nreally awakens in us the spiritual life,"},"1349":{"dur":3,"text":"from the grace that was given to\nus at baptism and conformation."},"1352":{"dur":5,"text":"Another experience that the Holy Spirit\nprovides is a desire to share that,"},"1358":{"dur":3,"text":"is that we experience God and\nwe just wanna tell other people."},"1361":{"dur":3,"text":"There is this sense of mission\nthat each one of us receives."},"1365":{"dur":3,"text":"A mission to share the faith,\na mission for words of mercy,"},"1368":{"dur":1,"text":"mission to feed the poor."},"1369":{"dur":3,"text":"Just that we realize that

and\nshare that with other people."},"1379":{"dur":3,"text":"I remember a bishop I\nmet one time in Africa."},"1382":{"dur":3,"text":"He was just talking to me about the\nimportance of baptism of the Holy Spirit"},"1386":{"dur":1,"text":"that really awakens our faith."},"1387":{"dur":3,"text":"And he said several things about that,\nhe said that so many people are
