underneath."},"289":{"dur":3,"text":"So it was really frustrating, kind of slowed us down."},"293":{"dur":3,"text":"So what are sort of the common, what's the common thread?"},"296":{"dur":1,"text":"Like, why was this happening?"},"298":{"dur":2,"text":"And it took me a while to figure it out."},"302":{"dur":3,"text":"The reason that I think it happens"},"306":{"dur":2,"text":"is that every time you add a new layer into the company,"},"309":{"dur":3,"text":"a new layer of management, stuff changes."},"312":{"dur":3,"text":"And things that used to work no longer work."},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is the tricky part, which is clearly"},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"you can't keep doing what you were doing before"},"320":{"dur":4,"text":"and hope it works, you need to figure out the hard part,"},"324":{"dur":3,"text":"which is what are the things you need to keep"},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"and keep doing the same way and what are the things"},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"you need to change?"},"334":{"dur":4,"text":"This also applies to the CEO,"},"338":{"dur":3,"text":"which would be the second thing in the

is totally true."},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"But it's actually not the number one job."},"370":{"dur":2,"text":"The number one job is survival."},"374":{"dur":1,"text":"Don't die."},"376":{"dur":3,"text":"Your job is to push the company as fast as possible"},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"to figure out whether you have an opportunity"},"381":{"dur":2,"text":"and execute on it

traction,"},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"it's really fun."},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"Really, really fun."},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"It's one of things that is,"},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"one of the biggest

it."},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"At the same time, be prepared."},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"You need to start preparing for something I call"},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"The CEO Success Irony."},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"So what is The CEO Success Irony?"},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"It's that as the company grows,"},"431":{"dur":1,"text":"the CEO job changes."},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"So what that means is you have to change."},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"The way you behave, how you work,"},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"and even change on the inside."},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is hard."},"447":{"dur":3,"text":"Actually really, really, really hard."},"452":{"dur":3,"text":"It's like rewiring your plane while you're trying to fly it."},"458":{"dur":3,"text":"You're working your tail off to fly the plane"},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"and try and make it, hopefully it gains altitude."},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"And you have to rip open the fuselage"},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"and start messing around with wiring."},"467":{"dur":1,"text":"(groans)"},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"It's like the last thing you wanna do"},"471":{"dur":3,"text":"but it's absolutely critical."},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"And what I realized just sort of looking through"},"476":{"dur":3,"text":"the rear view mirror is that"},"479":{"dur":3,"text":"I actually had three very different CEO jobs"},"483":{"dur":1,"text":"over my eight years."},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think this is probably generalizable"},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"to anyone in a leadership position"},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"that's going through significant growth."},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"So to make some superhero analogies here,"},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"the first CEO job is kind of like Captain America."},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"You're like in the woods with the troops throwing punches,"},"501":{"dur":1,"text":"doing hand-to-hand combat,"},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"getting dirty with everybody else."},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a blast."},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"Then the CEO job changed where it was a little bit more"},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"like the Avengers."},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"Whereas you and your band of superheroes"},"516":{"dur":3,"text":"and you had to hire and build a team of superheroes"},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"that all had their special superpower"},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"that was better than yours."},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"You need a sales superhero, a marketing superhero,"},"527":{"dur":3,"text":"an engineering superhero, a finance superhero;"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"and your job as CEO is to keep the avengers together"},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"and all going in the same direction."},"537":{"dur":3,"text":"And then in really sort of the last year and a half,"},"541":{"dur":3,"text":"the job changed again and it was a really big change."},"545":{"dur":3,"text":"it became sort of more like Professor Xavier in the X-Men,"},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"where you're like dean of a university,"},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"where your professors are your warriors"},"554":{"dur":3,"text":"and they're bringing up the next generation of students."},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"And instead of doing a lot of things for a lot of people,"},"561":{"dur":2,"text":"you have to change your way of thinking"},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"and instead be doing fewer things for a lot more people."},"571":{"dur":3,"text":"And these two transitions to these three jobs"},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"forces a fairly significant rewiring inside."},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is hard."},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think the key and trick to it"},"584":{"dur":4,"text":"is that ironically, the very things that make you successful"},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"in getting from A to B"},"593":{"dur":4,"text":"actually become the things that can hold you back"},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"or even kill you going from B to C."},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"And for me, I'll share some examples."},"608":{"dur":3,"text":"In the beginning I had my hands deep into the product."},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"But then I had to change my focus to be much more focused"},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"on the business as a whole."},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"In the beginning, I was much more detail-oriented"},"621":{"dur":3,"text":"and like really hands-on with everybody in the company."},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"But then I had to change and learn"},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"how to work through others."},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"In the beginning, I was always really good"},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"at keeping fairly complex execution plans in my head."},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"It's one of the things that sort of you need to do"},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"in the early days."},"640":{"dur":2,"text":"But that doesn't work anymore when you grow."},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"You have to be able to distill all that down"},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"to three, four, five goals"},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"that you can communicate to the whole company."},"650":{"dur":3,"text":"These are all really big sort of rewiring exercises for me,"},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"all while you're trying to fly the plane."},"656":{"dur":3,"text":"And this led to what was probably the hardest"},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"rewiring exercise for me."},"662":{"dur":3,"text":"And it took me a little while to figure this one out,"},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"which is that in some cases,"},"669":{"dur":1,"text":"I would let my fear"},"672":{"dur":3,"text":"of sort of short-term turbulence"},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"get in the way of making a decision"},"677":{"dur":3,"text":"to try and do the right long-term thing."},"681":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think where this came from is that for so long,"},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"I was focused on company survival"},"687":{"dur":3,"text":"that I needed to change my mindset to thrival,"},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"which is how do we go build a whopper?"},"694":{"dur":3,"text":"And sometimes, in trying to go build that big company"},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"that it can become and execute its scale,"},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"sometimes you do need to occasionally do something"},"705":{"dur":3,"text":"that creates a self-inflicted air pocket."},"708":{"dur":1,"text":"And I got my own way on that."},"710":{"dur":3,"text":"I occasionally let my fear of that self-inflicted air pocket"},"713":{"dur":3,"text":"get in the way of doing the right long-term thing."},"717":{"dur":3,"text":"It was really only in sort of the last year and a half"},"720":{"dur":2,"text":"that I really managed to push through that."},"726":{"dur":3,"text":"And all of this comes from sort of internal wiring."},"729":{"dur":3,"text":"How do you behave, what are your skills,"},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"what's going on inside of you?"},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"And what most people talk about when it comes to the job"},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"of being CEO is sort of the stuff that's on the outside:"},"740":{"dur":3,"text":"vision, determination, leadership, execution."},"743":{"dur":3,"text":"All that stuff's super important."},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"But what doesn't get enough air time"},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"is what's the stuff that's going on inside?"},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"What are the sort of hidden behaviors or skills"},"758":{"dur":3,"text":"that are really sort of the soul"},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"of who's leading the company?"},"764":{"dur":1,"text":"And I wanna talk about sort of what I think"},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"of the top three."},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"The first one is self-awareness."},"773":{"dur":3,"text":"It is really uncomfortable to look in the mirror,"},"776":{"dur":3,"text":"both for a person, as well as a team."},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"But unless you do it, you don't actually learn"},"782":{"dur":1,"text":"and get any better."},"784":{"dur":4,"text":"So listening to feedback hearing the tough information,"},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"taking that account, adapting, learning,"},"791":{"dur":2,"text":"all has its roots in self-awareness."},"796":{"dur":3,"text":"The second one is schizophrenia."},"803":{"dur":4,"text":"You might ask why schizophrenia."},"807":{"dur":4,"text":"So on one hand, you need to be this super optimistic"},"812":{"dur":3,"text":"Moses-type character leading people up the mountain."},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"And on the other hand, you need to be this completely"},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"paranoid pessimist looking over your shoulder"},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"wondering what could go wrong."},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"It's kind of psychotic actually,"},"824":{"dur":2,"text":"but you have to be able to do both at the same time."},"829":{"dur":3,"text":"And then the last one is"},"833":{"dur":2,"text":"the ability to close."},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"And this sometimes gets mistaken for"},"838":{"dur":2,"text":"can you when customers and sell stuff?"},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"That's sort of part of it, but it's actually much more"},"843":{"dur":2,"text":"deeper and much broader than that,"},"845":{"dur":3,"text":"which is, one of most important jobs and skills"},"848":{"dur":2,"text":"is your ability to get other people"},"850":{"dur":2,"text":"to jump on the bus with you."},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"That could be how do you win a customer?"},"855":{"dur":1,"text":"Sure."},"856":{"dur":2,"text":"But it can also be, how do you convince an investor"},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"to bet on your business?"},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"How do you recruit a top executive that you really want"},"866":{"dur":1,"text":"to be part of the company?"},"868":{"dur":2,"text":"Even like, how do you close your management team"},"870":{"dur":1,"text":"on your goals for the next year?"},"872":{"dur":2,"text":"You're doing it all the time."},"878":{"dur":4,"text":"And no doubt, being a founding CEO is a really hard job."},"885":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a fascinating, sometimes exhausting exercise"},"888":{"dur":1,"text":"in self-awareness."},"890":{"dur":2,"text":"It is a breathtaking learning curve,"},"892":{"dur":2,"text":"or you're not actually paying attention,"},"896":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's all-consuming."},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"It becomes really hard to draw boundaries"},"902":{"dur":2,"text":"between your work life and your personal life."},"905":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'll tell you sort of how that comes home to roost"},"908":{"dur":2,"text":"time and time again is that let's imagine"},"911":{"dur":2,"text":"you have three hours on a Saturday."},"915":{"dur":2,"text":"How do you spend it?"},"917":{"dur":2,"text":"Do you spend it with your family, with your friends,"},"920":{"dur":1,"text":"doing the things that are really"},"921":{"dur":2,"text":"important to you personally?"},"924":{"dur":2,"text":"Or do you spend it working on the company"},"927":{"dur":2,"text":"and trying to make the company more successful"},"929":{"dur":3,"text":"and the 500 families that are depending on that?"},"933":{"dur":3,"text":"That trade off happens every day of every week"},"937":{"dur":3,"text":"of every year, and that's exhausting."},"942":{"dur":2,"text":"But it's also part of the responsibility"},"944":{"dur":3,"text":"and part of the exhilaration of when it goes right."},"948":{"dur":2,"text":"So it is a really satisfying job."},"951":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a blast."},"953":{"dur":2,"text":"And like all big decisions in life,"},"955":{"dur":4,"text":"getting married, having kids, it changes you on the inside."},"959":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think for the better."},"966":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's go to the third item on the letter."},"971":{"dur":3,"text":"Building a business is really really, really,"},"974":{"dur":2,"text":"really different than just building a product."},"980":{"dur":3,"text":"This is probably one of my biggest lessons"},"984":{"dur":2,"text":"as an entrepreneur,"},"988":{"dur":2,"text":"which is that building a product"},"990":{"dur":2,"text":"is really, really, really different"},"992":{"dur":1,"text":"than building a business."},"993":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think frankly this is something that"},"995":{"dur":2,"text":"Silicon Valley gets wrong, and I think we need"},"997":{"dur":2,"text":"to do a better job of this."},"1000":{"dur":3,"text":"Silicon Valley is fundamentally a product shop."},"1004":{"dur":3,"text":"We do a spectacular job teaching

entrepreneurs how to build businesses"},"1017":{"dur":1,"text":"around those products."},"1019":{"dur":2,"text":"I think this is something that we as an ecosystem"},"1021":{"dur":2,"text":"need to work on."},"1024":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'll give you a really specific example."},"1029":{"dur":2,"text":"The common wisdom of going to build a company"},"1031":{"dur":1,"text":"and going to build a product"},"1033":{"dur":3,"text":"is get the product market fit and go,"},"1037":{"dur":2,"text":"hire sales, spend money, grow!"},"1044":{"dur":2,"text":"So you're super excited that you've worked hard,"},"1046":{"dur":2,"text":"that you've got to product market fit"},"1048":{"dur":2,"text":"and your plan is everything goes up and to the right."},"1050":{"dur":2,"text":"Awesome."},"1054":{"dur":3,"text":"The unfortunate reality that's more frequent than you think"},"1057":{"dur":2,"text":"is you bump along."},"1060":{"dur":2,"text":"And six months later, you wake up"},"1065":{"dur":2,"text":"and you haven't won that many more customers."},"1067":{"dur":2,"text":"Your original customers are super happy with you,"},"1069":{"dur":2,"text":"that's great, but you haven't really grown."},"1071":{"dur":2,"text":"Your team is starting to freak out a little bit,"},"1073":{"dur":4,"text":"your investors are getting really angsty."},"1078":{"dur":2,"text":"What's going on?"},"1082":{"dur":3,"text":"I think what's going on here is we make a mistake,"},"1085":{"dur":2,"text":"which is that product market fit,"},"1087":{"dur":2,"text":"product market fit is really important,"},"1090":{"dur":2,"text":"but product market fit is not sufficient"},"1093":{"dur":2,"text":"to grow your business."},"1097":{"dur":2,"text":"So what's the missing link?"},"1102":{"dur":3,"text":"The missing link is something I call"},"1107":{"dur":2,"text":"Go-To-Market fit,"},"1110":{"dur":2,"text":"which is how do you stitch together the problem,"},"1113":{"dur":3,"text":"marketing, sales, the customer to drive growth?"},"1119":{"dur":3,"text":"And this does not replace product market fit."},"1122":{"dur":2,"text":"As a matter of fact, they sort of run in parallel"},"1124":{"dur":2,"text":"slightly offset in time."},"1128":{"dur":1,"text":"So how does it work?"},"1130":{"dur":2,"text":"So with the tail end of product market fit,"},"1132":{"dur":3,"text":"you're usually winning customers and losing customers."},"1135":{"dur":2,"text":"So pay really close attention to what's happening there"},"1138":{"dur":3,"text":"because the world is teaching you right then."},"1141":{"dur":3,"text":"And you use that to inform your go-to-market

fine, but in order to go-to-market fit,"},"1190":{"dur":2,"text":"you have to figure out what your sales model looks like."},"1192":{"dur":3,"text":"It can be direct, it can be channel, it can be web,"},"1196":{"dur":2,"text":"it can be retail, it can be freemium,"},"1199":{"dur":2,"text":"it can be expand and upsell, it can be marketing lead,"},"1201":{"dur":1,"text":"it can be sales lead."},"1202":{"dur":2,"text":"It doesn't matter, but you just have to pick one."},"1207":{"dur":3,"text":"The second thing is your sales and marketing playbook."},"1213":{"dur":2,"text":"The most

come from?"},"1554":{"dur":3,"text":"It comes from you actually, the founders of the company."},"1559":{"dur":1,"text":"That's where it comes from."},"1561":{"dur":3,"text":"And one of the things

stuff like that."},"1666":{"dur":2,"text":"It was really like the conversation was"},"1669":{"dur":3,"text":"let's talk about the places we worked before,"},"1672":{"dur":3,"text":"and what about those cultures did we like?"},"1675":{"dur":2,"text":"And what about those cultures didn't we like?"},"1678":{"dur":2,"text":"And that actually was a really rich discussion."},"1680":{"dur":3,"text":"We learned a lot about each other as a part of that."},"1683":{"dur":3,"text":"And what we came up with were five things."},"1687":{"dur":3,"text":"One, we and our customers win together."},"1691":{"dur":2,"text":"Two, intellectual honesty."},"1694":{"dur":3,"text":"Look in the mirror, celebrate the good"},"1698":{"dur":2,"text":"but talk about the bad."},"1701":{"dur":1,"text":"Be accountable to each other,"},"1702":{"dur":2,"text":"we're smart and intense and be frugal"},"1705":{"dur":3,"text":"and treat the company's money like your

up on the wall"},"1717":{"dur":1,"text":"and been done with it, but that actually"},"1719":{"dur":2,"text":"doesn't accomplish the goal of building a culture."},"1722":{"dur":3,"text":"You actually have to bring the culture alive."},"1726":{"dur":3,"text":"And some things I learned along the way"},"1729":{"dur":2,"text":"about how to bring your culture alive"},"1732":{"dur":2,"text":"is the number one thing is use real words"},"1736":{"dur":2,"text":"that mean something to people"},"1739":{"dur":2,"text":"and not like stuff from a gym poster."},"1741":{"dur":2,"text":"Like accelerate with a race car,"},"1744":{"dur":2,"text":"or inspiration with an eagle soaring."},"1746":{"dur":2,"text":"Or integrity with two people shaking hands."},"1748":{"dur":2,"text":"Like, I don't know what to do with that stuff"},"1750":{"dur":3,"text":"and I don't think anybody else does either."},"1755":{"dur":1,"text":"So use it."},"1757":{"dur":3,"text":"Like in big meetings, board meetings, all-hands meetings,"},"1760":{"dur":2,"text":"we would start every meeting with what's going well"},"1762":{"dur":2,"text":"or what's not going well."},"1765":{"dur":2,"text":"Use it to guide big

it."},"1776":{"dur":2,"text":"There's lots of little things every day that happen"},"1779":{"dur":2,"text":"that sort of reinforce the culture."},"1781":{"dur":2,"text":"And nothing can undermine the culture faster"},"1783":{"dur":2,"text":"than if the little things don't add up."},"1786":{"dur":1,"text":"And these come from you."},"1787":{"dur":2,"text":"It could be how you react to a tough

Europe."},"1796":{"dur":3,"text":"All those things are little signals."},"1800":{"dur":2,"text":"And the last thing about culture"},"1802":{"dur":2,"text":"is culture is like a relationship,"},"1804":{"dur":3,"text":"like you gotta talk about it and talk about it regularly,"},"1808":{"dur":3,"text":"whether it's an executive team, in offsites,"},"1811":{"dur":2,"text":"when

one of those little company lore"},"1831":{"dur":2,"text":"and tradition stories with you guys,"},"1833":{"dur":3,"text":"which is in the early days of MobileIron"},"1836":{"dur":2,"text":"I loved the movie Office Space."},"1838":{"dur":3,"text":"Who's seen the movie Office Space."},"1841":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, some of you will appreciate this."},"1844":{"dur":3,"text":"And as a joke for our first

movie,"},"1858":{"dur":2,"text":"the red Swingline stapler features prominently"},"1861":{"dur":3,"text":"throughout the plot."},"1864":{"dur":1,"text":"Now the funny thing about that movie was that Swingline"},"1866":{"dur":3,"text":"at the time didn't actually make a red Swingline stapler."},"1869":{"dur":2,"text":"It was a prop made by the movie studios."},"1872":{"dur":2,"text":"But apparently after the movie, so many people asked"},"1874":{"dur":2,"text":"for a red Swingline stapler that Swingline then made"},"1877":{"dur":2,"text":"a red stapler."},"1879":{"dur":2,"text":"So for Christmas, everybody got a red Swingline stapler."},"1882":{"dur":2,"text":"Ha-ha, kind of a joke, Bob you're quirky."},"1885":{"dur":2,"text":"And then it kept going."},"1889":{"dur":1,"text":"Everybody who joined MobileIron"},"1891":{"dur":3,"text":"then got a red Swingline stapler in their welcome kit."},"1894":{"dur":1,"text":"And some people got the joke,"},"1896":{"dur":2,"text":"and other people had no idea why they had"},"1898":{"dur":2,"text":"a red Swingline stapler."},"1900":{"dur":2,"text":"But it became one of those things that bound us together"},"1903":{"dur":3,"text":"and it was just sitting there on our desk every day."},"1906":{"dur":1,"text":"And people would ask about it and talk about it."},"1908":{"dur":2,"text":"It became just one of those little company lore"},"1910":{"dur":3,"text":"and culture things that tied us together."},"1913":{"dur":4,"text":"So in the spirit of paying culture forward,"},"1919":{"dur":2,"text":"taped to the underside of one of your chairs,"},"1922":{"dur":3,"text":"probably somewhere in here is an envelope."},"1927":{"dur":3,"text":"If you open the envelope, there's a red Swingline stapler."},"1931":{"dur":2,"text":"A picture of a red Swingline stapler."},"1933":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you come down afterwards,"},"1936":{"dur":3,"text":"you get your very own red Swingline stapler."},"1940":{"dur":1,"text":"There it is, all right, come on down afterwards"},"1942":{"dur":2,"text":"to get your very own red Swingline stapler."},"1944":{"dur":2,"text":"(audience laughing)"},"1951":{"dur":3,"text":"Everybody is like, why didn't I sit there?"},"1956":{"dur":1,"text":"(chuckles)"},"1958":{"dur":3,"text":"So when it comes to the culture and the people,"},"1962":{"dur":3,"text":"the early founders are where it starts."},"1966":{"dur":3,"text":"The founders are the seed corn that build the early product,"},"1970":{"dur":1,"text":"that hire the original team."},"1972":{"dur":1,"text":"And they're the ones that frankly,"},"1973":{"dur":1,"text":"bring the mission to life."},"1975":{"dur":2,"text":"And if it starts to work,"},"1978":{"dur":2,"text":"your mission then grows and starts to turn"},"1980":{"dur":1,"text":"into something that matters,"},"1982":{"dur":3,"text":"which is a really special thing."},"1986":{"dur":3,"text":"And then as the company grows and evolves,"},"1989":{"dur":2,"text":"it's really important as founders"},"1992":{"dur":2,"text":"to change and evolve with the company"},"1995":{"dur":2,"text":"and be open to change."},"1997":{"dur":2,"text":"And I've seen some companies do this well"},"2000":{"dur":3,"text":"and some companies do this terribly."},"2003":{"dur":4,"text":"And this leads me to something that I call"},"2008":{"dur":2,"text":"The Founder Oath."},"2011":{"dur":2,"text":"And sort of like The Hippocratic Oath"},"2013":{"dur":3,"text":"that doctors take to do no harm,"},"2016":{"dur":2,"text":"The Founder Oath goes something like this,"},"2018":{"dur":3,"text":"which is that it's about the mission."},"2025":{"dur":2,"text":"Not me, or my ego."},"2029":{"dur":3,"text":"And I promise to do my best to separate my ego"},"2032":{"dur":2,"text":"from the business."},"2036":{"dur":2,"text":"The second thing is that while a lot of the people"},"2039":{"dur":3,"text":"work for us, that don't ever forget"},"2042":{"dur":3,"text":"that we work for the company and the team."},"2046":{"dur":2,"text":"And the third part of the founder pledge"},"2049":{"dur":2,"text":"is that I recognize that very few things"},"2052":{"dur":3,"text":"can screw up a company more than founder drama."},"2057":{"dur":3,"text":"And if we are fortunate the company grows beyond us,"},"2062":{"dur":3,"text":"that I will step aside gracefully"},"2065":{"dur":2,"text":"for the good of the mission."},"2070":{"dur":3,"text":"And these are not hollow words to me."},"2074":{"dur":2,"text":"Every single one of the three founders,"},"2076":{"dur":2,"text":"AJ, Suresh and myself at some point"},"2078":{"dur":3,"text":"stepped out of our initial operational role."},"2082":{"dur":1,"text":"Every single one of us."},"2083":{"dur":2,"text":"And I gotta tell you, it's not fun."},"2086":{"dur":1,"text":"It's kind of hard on the ego."},"2088":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a weird out-of-body

the entrepreneurship world?"},"2208":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, the first thing is that hard things take a while."},"2212":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's really important to have the

ever got,"},"2564":{"dur":3,"text":"believe it or not, came from a skydiving instructor."},"2569":{"dur":2,"text":"Who's been skydiving?"},"2571":{"dur":2,"text":"Hmm, all right, pretty good."},"2574":{"dur":4,"text":"So I went to my lesson to learn how to skydive"},"2578":{"dur":3,"text":"and the skydiving instructor had two pieces of advice."},"2583":{"dur":2,"text":"The first one was when you go up in the plane"},"2585":{"dur":2,"text":"and you're at 14,000 feet and you're standing at the door"},"2588":{"dur":3,"text":"going like this, looking so far down that the ground"},"2592":{"dur":2,"text":"looks like a painting,"},"2594":{"dur":3,"text":"every bone in your body is gonna be screaming don't jump."},"2599":{"dur":2,"text":"His advice was have courage and jump."},"2603":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, file that one away."},"2607":{"dur":3,"text":"The second piece of advice he had, I didn't expect,"},"2611":{"dur":4,"text":"which is he said after you jump and you roll over"},"2615":{"dur":2,"text":"and you look at the plane flying away,"},"2618":{"dur":3,"text":"you quickly accelerate to over 200 miles an hour."},"2621":{"dur":2,"text":"Your adrenaline

remember their jump."},"2637":{"dur":2,"text":"They were in such sensory overload"},"2640":{"dur":3,"text":"they don't remember their jump."},"2643":{"dur":2,"text":"His advice was"},"2647":{"dur":2,"text":"in the midst of all the noise, the adrenaline,"},"2649":{"dur":3,"text":"the fear, slow your brain down"},"2654":{"dur":2,"text":"and take mental pictures."},"2657":{"dur":3,"text":"Slow your brain down and take mental pictures."},"2663":{"dur":3,"text":"So for those of you that someday"},"2667":{"dur":4,"text":"will take the leap, have courage."},"2671":{"dur":2,"text":"And in the heat of battle, the smoke, the lights,"},"2674":{"dur":3,"text":"the noise, make sure you slow your brain down"},"2678":{"dur":2,"text":"and take pictures."},"2682":{"dur":3,"text":"And someday, that'll be you"},"2688":{"dur":2,"text":"standing with your team"},"2690":{"dur":2,"text":"taking an all hands picture"},"2692":{"dur":3,"text":"and

honor."},"2716":{"dur":2,"text":"But I'd also like to thank a bunch of other people"},"2718":{"dur":3,"text":"that played enormous roles in my journey and my learning"},"2721":{"dur":1,"text":"over the last eight years."},"2723":{"dur":2,"text":"I'd like to thank my team at MobileIron"},"2726":{"dur":2,"text":"who jumped into the boat and rode like hell with me"},"2729":{"dur":3,"text":"for

questions."},"2763":{"dur":2,"text":"(indistinct chattering)"},"2765":{"dur":2,"text":"Here, we'll let a couple of the people clear out"},"2767":{"dur":1,"text":"then we'll do questions."},"2768":{"dur":3,"text":"Don't forget to come get your stapler."},"2774":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah, there was a question up here,"},"2775":{"dur":2,"text":"and then we'll do one in the back there."},"2777":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah."},"2779":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Man] Out of all the requirements that you said"},"2780":{"dur":3,"text":"for founders, like they have to meet their culture,"},"2784":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, (indistinct muttering)"},"2790":{"dur":2,"text":"they have to all have different strengths,"},"2792":{"dur":3,"text":"and then you gotta sell them on the big picture"},"2795":{"dur":3,"text":"(indistinct muttering)"},"2805":{"dur":2,"text":"what's that process look like to acquire these people?"},"2808":{"dur":1,"text":"- To bring together the initial founding team?"},"2810":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Man] Yes."},"2811":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yeah, so the question was sort of how do you bring"},"2814":{"dur":2,"text":"together that initial cofounding team"},"2816":{"dur":2,"text":"since so many things after that kind of depend on that."},"2818":{"dur":1,"text":"Is that--\n- [Man] Yeah."},"2820":{"dur":2,"text":"And then you have to have a history with these people too."},"2822":{"dur":3,"text":"You don't wanna bring somebody on at some random event."},"2827":{"dur":2,"text":"It's like getting married in Vegas."},"2829":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, that's true."},"2831":{"dur":2,"text":"So how do you find that initial founding team?"},"2835":{"dur":2,"text":"There's no one recipe for it, actually."},"2837":{"dur":2,"text":"I'd love to be able to say here's the answer."},"2840":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll tell you sort of what I've seen,"},"2842":{"dur":2,"text":"which is that in terms of bringing together"},"2844":{"dur":2,"text":"the initial founding team,"},"2847":{"dur":2,"text":"the number one thing is that you actually all care about"},"2849":{"dur":2,"text":"whatever it is you're gonna go do."},"2851":{"dur":2,"text":"Like you've got passion for the space or the problem,"},"2853":{"dur":2,"text":"and that can come lots of different ways."},"2855":{"dur":2,"text":"It can be from somebody who is in an adjacent space,"},"2857":{"dur":2,"text":"somebody who has thought it was interesting,"},"2859":{"dur":1,"text":"somebody who has been in the industry for 20 years,"},"2861":{"dur":1,"text":"somebody who did their thesis on it."},"2862":{"dur":1,"text":"Like, just gotta be really passionate about the space."},"2864":{"dur":1,"text":"That's the number one thing."},"2866":{"dur":1,"text":"The second thing, and you're right,"},"2868":{"dur":1,"text":"this is kind of like getting married,"},"2869":{"dur":3,"text":"is that you gotta have sort of simpatico"},"2873":{"dur":1,"text":"and spend some time with them."},"2874":{"dur":1,"text":"So you sort of feel like you like them"},"2876":{"dur":1,"text":"and you wanna spend time with them"},"2877":{"dur":2,"text":"because you're gonna spend a lot of time with them."},"2879":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's sort of like dating somebody and you're like,"},"2882":{"dur":2,"text":"well, I think that problem will kind of go away later,"},"2885":{"dur":2,"text":"usually doesn't.\n(chuckles)"},"2888":{"dur":2,"text":"And the third thing that I found"},"2890":{"dur":2,"text":"in sort of bringing together cofounders is having"},"2895":{"dur":1,"text":"just sort of different perspectives."},"2896":{"dur":1,"text":"You don't want everybody to be sort of"},"2898":{"dur":1,"text":"cookie-cutter the same."},"2899":{"dur":2,"text":"Like, the last thing you wanna do is sort of start a company"},"2901":{"dur":2,"text":"and say I've got three X McKinsey consultants"},"2904":{"dur":1,"text":"that are all coming from the same group"},"2905":{"dur":1,"text":"to go start a company."},"2907":{"dur":2,"text":"Like you need sort of people with different backgrounds."},"2909":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's great if you can have somebody"},"2911":{"dur":2,"text":"that's sort of technical, somebody that's more product"},"2913":{"dur":1,"text":"and go-to-market oriented."},"2914":{"dur":3,"text":"That's sort of the classic combo to go get a company"},"2918":{"dur":1,"text":"off the ground."},"2919":{"dur":2,"text":"Now for me, what was interesting is in terms of"},"2921":{"dur":3,"text":"the three of us, two of us knew each other before"},"2924":{"dur":3,"text":"and Suresh, the third, we didn't know before."},"2927":{"dur":3,"text":"But we found him, which is almost as good"},"2930":{"dur":1,"text":"as somebody you knew before,"},"2931":{"dur":2,"text":"through somebody we knew that we trusted."},"2934":{"dur":2,"text":"So sort of the one degree removed"},"2936":{"dur":3,"text":"of somebody you really respect if they respect this person."},"2939":{"dur":2,"text":"That's not quite as good as having known them before"},"2941":{"dur":3,"text":"but it's a pretty good headstart."},"2945":{"dur":2,"text":"Next question was back there."},"2947":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Man] You talked about a trillion dollar"},"2949":{"dur":1,"text":"industry in business.\n- Yes."},"2950":{"dur":2,"text":"- [Man] How does one go about getting experience"},"2953":{"dur":1,"text":"to find those kind of problems"},"2954":{"dur":3,"text":"(coughing drowns out dialog)"},"2957":{"dur":2,"text":"(indistinct muttering)"},"2962":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yes."},"2963":{"dur":2,"text":"So the question was hey look,"},"2967":{"dur":2,"text":"this trillion-dollar enterprise opportunity,"},"2969":{"dur":2,"text":"how do we go get experience to figure out"},"2971":{"dur":1,"text":"how to be part of that?"},"2972":{"dur":2,"text":"Is that essentially the question?"},"2974":{"dur":1,"text":"And you also hit on a really good point there,"},"2976":{"dur":2,"text":"is that one of the things about the consumer world"},"2978":{"dur":2,"text":"is we all see it every day so it's sort of easy for us"},"2980":{"dur":3,"text":"to relate to and be like, I'm gonna go do that."},"2984":{"dur":2,"text":"The enterprise sometimes"},"2987":{"dur":1,"text":"is a little more opaque."},"2988":{"dur":3,"text":"Like you don't necessarily relate to it as a consumer."},"2991":{"dur":2,"text":"So you actually have to make an effort"},"2993":{"dur":2,"text":"to go learn about that industry."},"2995":{"dur":2,"text":"Me personally, I just love building stuff,"},"2997":{"dur":2,"text":"building stuff that matters, that's gonna be around,"},"2999":{"dur":2,"text":"and I think the enterprise sort of fits that category."},"3001":{"dur":3,"text":"So for those of you sitting in school right now"},"3005":{"dur":1,"text":"thinking about how to go get experience"},"3007":{"dur":2,"text":"in the enterprise market, you are sitting at sort of"},"3009":{"dur":3,"text":"the ground zero for most of the major enterprise technology"},"3014":{"dur":2,"text":"companies in the world."},"3016":{"dur":3,"text":"So one option is go work for one of the mid or large"},"3019":{"dur":3,"text":"enterprise companies out there and go get some experience."},"3022":{"dur":3,"text":"The second one is there are tons,"},"3026":{"dur":2,"text":"remember I said sort of all these market leaders"},"3028":{"dur":1,"text":"are being born right now?"},"3030":{"dur":3,"text":"There's probably 50 or 60 companies that are, right now,"},"3033":{"dur":2,"text":"achieving sort of mid side scale in the enterprise space."},"3036":{"dur":2,"text":"They have a chance to really be one of the leaders"},"3038":{"dur":1,"text":"over the next 10 years."},"3040":{"dur":1,"text":"Go figure out."},"3041":{"dur":2,"text":"They're getting to the stage where sometimes"},"3043":{"dur":3,"text":"they're willing to hire people right out of school."},"3046":{"dur":2,"text":"The third one is just do your homework."},"3048":{"dur":3,"text":"Start reading like magazines around enterprise technology."},"3052":{"dur":2,"text":"Pay attention to blog posts on it."},"3054":{"dur":3,"text":"Like one of the challenge with consumer world"},"3057":{"dur":2,"text":"is a lot of times the most advanced interesting problems"},"3060":{"dur":2,"text":"actually don't get solved in the consumer world first."},"3062":{"dur":2,"text":"They get solved in the enterprise world first"},"3064":{"dur":1,"text":"and then trickle out to the consumer."},"3066":{"dur":2,"text":"So actually, some of the really gnarly interesting problems"},"3068":{"dur":2,"text":"are being solved in the enterprise space."},"3070":{"dur":2,"text":"And go figure out what those are."},"3073":{"dur":2,"text":"For me, when I was coming out of school,"},"3075":{"dur":2,"text":"I asked the same question and Don Valentine,"},"3079":{"dur":1,"text":"one of the founders of Sequioa was giving a talk"},"3081":{"dur":3,"text":"about enterprise in 1998 actually."},"3084":{"dur":2,"text":"And he talked about the convergence of voice and data,"},"3086":{"dur":2,"text":"which we all sort of laugh about now."},"3088":{"dur":1,"text":"Duh, voice over IP exists."},"3090":{"dur":2,"text":"But at that point, nobody had done voice over IP before."},"3092":{"dur":2,"text":"So I was like, that sounds interesting."},"3094":{"dur":1,"text":"So I went, did a bunch of research on that"},"3096":{"dur":2,"text":"and ended up working at a voice over IP startup."},"3098":{"dur":2,"text":"It was too early actually."},"3100":{"dur":2,"text":"Voice over IP didn't take off till like 2005,"},"3102":{"dur":2,"text":"but I learned a lot along the way."},"3105":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah, stapler guy."},"3108":{"dur":2,"text":"(indistinct muttering)"},"3114":{"dur":3,"text":"So the question was when is something too early?"},"3118":{"dur":2,"text":"How do you know it's the right time or the right idea?"},"3120":{"dur":3,"text":"This one is sort of a mixture of logic and instinct."},"3125":{"dur":2,"text":"The instinct on it is sort of connecting the dots"},"3127":{"dur":2,"text":"and sort of seeing what some of the trendlines are,"},"3129":{"dur":1,"text":"sort of like Wayne Gretzky skating to where"},"3131":{"dur":1,"text":"the puck is gonna be."},"3132":{"dur":2,"text":"That's sort of the instinct part."},"3134":{"dur":2,"text":"The part that's logic is you can actually go"},"3136":{"dur":2,"text":"do your homework to figure it out."},"3138":{"dur":2,"text":"The number one way to do that is go talk"},"3140":{"dur":2,"text":"to whoever the customers are that would buy"},"3142":{"dur":3,"text":"whatever you're talking about."},"3146":{"dur":3,"text":"My experience on that one is that"},"3149":{"dur":3,"text":"for MobileIron, we spent six months talking to customers,"},"3152":{"dur":2,"text":"six months, before we wrote a line of code"},"3155":{"dur":3,"text":"or raised a dollar of venture capital."},"3158":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's sort of inverted from sort of the common wisdom,"},"3160":{"dur":2,"text":"which is hey, we've got a cool technology."},"3162":{"dur":1,"text":"Who to sell it to?"},"3164":{"dur":2,"text":"That's actually not the way most companies are successful."},"3166":{"dur":2,"text":"The companies who are successful are the ones"},"3168":{"dur":1,"text":"that could do their homework on the market"},"3169":{"dur":1,"text":"and the customers."},"3170":{"dur":1,"text":"They connect the dots and say that's where"},"3172":{"dur":2,"text":"the world is going, I'm gonna skate there."},"3175":{"dur":2,"text":"That way you can tell whether it's too early."},"3178":{"dur":1,"text":"And sometimes, even if you think it's a little bit early,"},"3179":{"dur":2,"text":"screw it, do it anyway."},"3183":{"dur":0,"text":"Yeah."},"3184":{"dur":2,"text":"(indistinct muttering)"},"3194":{"dur":2,"text":"Oh I'm so glad you asked that question."},"3196":{"dur":1,"text":"So let me repeat that."},"3198":{"dur":1,"text":"So her question was about self-awareness."},"3200":{"dur":2,"text":"It's easy to say but hard to do,"},"3202":{"dur":2,"text":"and how do you sort of know whether you're doing it or not?"},"3204":{"dur":2,"text":"And I would also add to that, when you're interviewing"},"3207":{"dur":2,"text":"to hire people, how do you figure out"},"3209":{"dur":3,"text":"whether they're self-aware too?"},"3212":{"dur":2,"text":"Self-awareness, whew, big topic."},"3215":{"dur":1,"text":"All right."},"3217":{"dur":2,"text":"So number one, in terms of how are you being self-aware,"},"3224":{"dur":2,"text":"the first way I do that"},"3226":{"dur":1,"text":"is you almost have sort of this little observer"},"3228":{"dur":3,"text":"outside of yourself that after you have a meeting,"},"3231":{"dur":2,"text":"you have a conversation, you do something,"},"3233":{"dur":2,"text":"you make a decision, you sort of ask yourself"},"3235":{"dur":2,"text":"how'd I do on that?"},"3238":{"dur":3,"text":"And the important thing is to not market to yourself."},"3241":{"dur":2,"text":"How you know you're not being self-aware"},"3243":{"dur":2,"text":"is if you're marketing to yourself."},"3246":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's gotta be a mixture of sort of good and bad."},"3249":{"dur":2,"text":"So your measure of self-awareness should always be,"},"3251":{"dur":2,"text":"I feel like there's good news and bad news in there"},"3253":{"dur":2,"text":"so I feel like I'm being honest with myself."},"3256":{"dur":2,"text":"That's sort of number one."},"3259":{"dur":3,"text":"Number two is ask for critical feedback"},"3263":{"dur":2,"text":"and watch how you react to it."},"3265":{"dur":2,"text":"So here's another little self-awareness loop."},"3267":{"dur":2,"text":"Lots of people ask for critical feedback"},"3269":{"dur":3,"text":"and they get defensive and sort of like argue about it."},"3272":{"dur":3,"text":"Like, the irony feedback to people sometimes"},"3277":{"dur":2,"text":"is that you're not very good at taking feedback."},"3279":{"dur":1,"text":"(chuckles)"},"3281":{"dur":3,"text":"So ask for critical feedback and then really internalize it,"},"3286":{"dur":2,"text":"put your defenses down."},"3288":{"dur":3,"text":"And most importantly, be vulnerable."},"3293":{"dur":2,"text":"One of the core measures in my mind"},"3295":{"dur":2,"text":"of whether you're actually being
