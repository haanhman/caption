down."},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"But let's look at each item one by one."},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"So, this is the Canon 60D."},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"Probably a few of you have got this already."},"533":{"dur":5,"text":"This is the camera that James uses and this\nis sort of the DSLR camera of choice and I"},"539":{"dur":3,"text":"recommend... there's these other cameras that\nare similar."},"542":{"dur":2,"text":"I recommend this one because a lot of people\nare using this already."},"545":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you want to learn, there's plenty of\npeople around you who are using it."},"549":{"dur":4,"text":"The reason why I recommend this is that it\ncreates that blurred background, shallow depth"},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"of field sort of look which looks really filmic."},"556":{"dur":4,"text":"It makes it look really professional and at\nthe moment, people love that look."},"561":{"dur":5,"text":"Now the lens that goes along with that, that\na lot of people are choosing, is the Canon"},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"50mm F1.8."},"569":{"dur":5,"text":"And what that'll do is even enhance that blurred\nbackground filmic sort of look."},"574":{"dur":5,"text":"Now the thing with this DSLR setup is that\nthere's a little bit more of the learning"},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"curve than just using a video camera."},"582":{"dur":3,"text":"So what you might find when you start doing\nsomething like this is that you'll get it"},"585":{"dur":3,"text":"out of focus, or you'll start in focus then\nit'll go out of focus."},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"So be prepared for that learning curve."},"591":{"dur":4,"text":"Be prepared for some frustrations but if you\ncan stick with it, you'll see the results."},"595":{"dur":5,"text":"And you guys would have noticed the results\nof James' work over last year."},"601":{"dur":4,"text":"He's stuck with using this equipment and practiced\nand mastered it."},"605":{"dur":3,"text":"So, you need an SD Card to record on."},"609":{"dur":5,"text":"This is a 32GB card where you can record about\nan hour and a half worth of footage."},"614":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a class 10 card so there's cheaper cards\nthan this."},"617":{"dur":3,"text":"So, don't get one of the cheaper ones."},"620":{"dur":3,"text":"This is made for HD videos, it says on the\ncard."},"624":{"dur":4,"text":"Yeah, that card will do you fine."},"629":{"dur":1,"text":"You're going to need a lighting kit."},"630":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's a LightPro 3-Head Softbox kit."},"633":{"dur":7,"text":"There's many variations with this sort of\nkit but the main thing is that a softbox kit"},"640":{"dur":2,"text":"creates a soft light, which is like a flattering\nlight."},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"You see people in forums talk about work lights\nor lamps."},"646":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, they might be filming without lights\nso there's just these downlights from the"},"651":{"dur":3,"text":"ceiling which often create these ugly shadows\nunderneath your eyes."},"654":{"dur":5,"text":"So a softbox is a... just a really flattering\nneutral sort of light and later on in the"},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"presentation I'll show you guys how to set\nthis up."},"664":{"dur":4,"text":"This is a Tascam DR-100 which is the audio\nrecording device that we use."},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"We've been talking about the Zoom H4n which\nis basically the same thing."},"673":{"dur":6,"text":"So with the DSLR cameras, it's better to record\nthe audio into something like this than it"},"679":{"dur":1,"text":"is to go straight into the camera."},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"You can go into the camera but this is going\nto give you better results."},"683":{"dur":3,"text":"So, as you can tell, there's a little bit\nmore of a learning curve with this type of"},"687":{"dur":5,"text":"equipment but by recording the audio separately\nand then linking it up in the edit, you're"},"693":{"dur":3,"text":"going to get a more professional result."},"696":{"dur":3,"text":"This is a lapel microphone."},"699":{"dur":1,"text":"Can you raise your hand if you're using a\nlapel microphone?"},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"OK, cool."},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"So a lot of you are quite familiar with this."},"704":{"dur":5,"text":"The great thing about this is... and are you\nguys filming your videos often just by yourself,"},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"you're doing it just yourself?"},"712":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah?"},"713":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's just really convenient because you\ncan clip it onto your jacket or onto your"},"716":{"dur":4,"text":"shirt and if you want to make it look more\nprofessional, run the cable underneath your"},"721":{"dur":3,"text":"shirt so you can't actually see it when you're\nfilming."},"724":{"dur":4,"text":"I like this microphone, this Sony ECM-44B."},"728":{"dur":4,"text":"It's sort of a semi-professional microphone\nbut there's plenty of others along the same"},"733":{"dur":5,"text":"line so you know, test something out and see\nwhich one you like best."},"738":{"dur":4,"text":"This is just an extension cable for your microphone."},"743":{"dur":1,"text":"And a tripod."},"744":{"dur":6,"text":"If you're just doing face-the-camera videos\nin a locked off shot, all you need is a basic,"},"750":{"dur":1,"text":"cheap tripod like this one."},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"I think it's about $120 or $150."},"754":{"dur":5,"text":"The important thing about buying a cheap tripod\nis make sure that it rises right up to your"},"759":{"dur":5,"text":"eye level because a lot of these tripods will\nonly go up to maybe your chest sort of level"},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"and then you're going to get that low angle\nkind of shot."},"767":{"dur":4,"text":"Like, double-chin, up-the-nostril kind of\neffect, which is not so flattering."},"771":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's why this one is good."},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"So as I said, this is just for locked off\nshots."},"777":{"dur":4,"text":"If you want to do something a little bit more\ncomplex, like tilting and panning the camera"},"782":{"dur":5,"text":"and moving it around, then you're going to\nneed what's called a Fluid Head Tripod, like"},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"the cool tripod over there."},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's a lot more expensive."},"791":{"dur":4,"text":"But for news videos and face-the-camera videos,\nall you really need is something that's going"},"795":{"dur":3,"text":"to hold your camera, like this one."},"798":{"dur":2,"text":"Spare battery for obvious reasons."},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's... there's the kit again."},"803":{"dur":6,"text":"So I'm not saying that you have to have this\nif you want to make videos."},"809":{"dur":7,"text":"This is, to me, a good ideal kit if you want\na video production strategy where maybe you're"},"817":{"dur":3,"text":"going to be making a news video every week\nor you're going to be filming some customer"},"820":{"dur":1,"text":"testimonial videos."},"821":{"dur":4,"text":"You might be moving around and it becomes\npart of your ongoing strategy that's making"},"826":{"dur":3,"text":"you money, I see that this is a really good\ninvestment."},"829":{"dur":4,"text":"If you just have an iPhone at the moment,\nthat's fine."},"834":{"dur":1,"text":"Start with that."},"835":{"dur":5,"text":"You know, don't let the lack of technology\nbe a limitation."},"840":{"dur":5,"text":"If you have a webcam, that's great too you\nknow, start with that or a handycam."},"845":{"dur":5,"text":"Use what you have and keep on using it and\nmaster the technology and then let that become"},"851":{"dur":3,"text":"the limitation where you say, \"Gee you know,\nthere's more than I want to do with this."},"854":{"dur":2,"text":"I want this to start to look more professional."},"857":{"dur":1,"text":"I want to be able to move around more."},"858":{"dur":2,"text":"There's more that I want to do.\""},"861":{"dur":3,"text":"When I created my kit, I just started with\nthe camera, tripod and microphone and then"},"865":{"dur":4,"text":"slowly added things like lights one step at\na time."},"869":{"dur":5,"text":"But I think the point is that if you're going\nto build this in as part of your ongoing strategy,"},"875":{"dur":4,"text":"it's a pretty cheap investment for the return\nthat it's going to bring you."},"880":{"dur":5,"text":"So I'm going to talk you guys through my best\ntips for improving your sound and picture"},"885":{"dur":1,"text":"and framing."},"886":{"dur":5,"text":"I thought to myself, \"How can I, in 15 minutes,\ncome up with the best ideas that are going"},"892":{"dur":2,"text":"to have the biggest effect on the quality\nof your video?\""},"895":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's often the simplest things."},"897":{"dur":4,"text":"So I started with audio because to me, this\nis the most important thing."},"901":{"dur":5,"text":"A lot of the time people fixate on cameras\nand they fixate on the look of the video."},"906":{"dur":2,"text":"But audio is more important than vision."},"909":{"dur":4,"text":"If you have something interesting to say and\npeople can hear you clearly, they're going"},"914":{"dur":2,"text":"to listen even if the picture quality is not\nfantastic."},"917":{"dur":1,"text":"They're going to go on a journey with you."},"919":{"dur":4,"text":"But if it's the other way around, no matter\nhow awesome your images are, if they can't"},"923":{"dur":3,"text":"hear you properly, you're going to lose them\nand they're going to go somewhere else."},"926":{"dur":6,"text":"So if you're starting off, focus on your audio\nbecause most people when they start are just"},"933":{"dur":3,"text":"completely caught up in the picture side of\nthings."},"936":{"dur":4,"text":"This is a really simple rule but it's amazing\nhow often people just don't get it right at"},"941":{"dur":1,"text":"the start."},"942":{"dur":4,"text":"The most important thing about audio is get\nthe microphone in as close as possible to"},"947":{"dur":1,"text":"the source of sound."},"948":{"dur":5,"text":"So I'll often see someone with a DSLR camera\nand they'll mount a little shotgun microphone"},"954":{"dur":6,"text":"on the camera and then they'll take a few\nsteps back and the microphone's over there"},"960":{"dur":2,"text":"and you're not going to get good, clear sound."},"963":{"dur":3,"text":"You're not only recording the sound of my\nvoice but you're getting the room, you're"},"966":{"dur":1,"text":"getting the air conditioning."},"968":{"dur":4,"text":"The whole idea is if the microphone's there\nyou want it to be nice and close to isolate"},"972":{"dur":1,"text":"the sound."},"974":{"dur":8,"text":"That's why a lapel microphone is great because\nit's so close to the actual source of sound."},"982":{"dur":3,"text":"These are the three main types of microphones\nthat you're probably going to use."},"986":{"dur":3,"text":"There's a shotgun microphone on the left,\nthere's the lapel that you're familiar with,"},"990":{"dur":1,"text":"and Zoom H4n."},"991":{"dur":5,"text":"I'm showing you guys that shotgun microphone\nbecause it actually is going to give you the"},"997":{"dur":1,"text":"best quality sound."},"998":{"dur":2,"text":"But you've got to get it in nice and close."},"1001":{"dur":3,"text":"So, that's the microphone that I use and I\nactually put it on a stand."},"1005":{"dur":2,"text":"So the microphone is up on a stand, on a pole."},"1007":{"dur":6,"text":"And when I film my face-to-camera videos,\nit will be hanging above me just out of shot"},"1014":{"dur":1,"text":"and that gives really good sound."},"1015":{"dur":4,"text":"So if you do want to use the shotgun, don't\nput it on the camera."},"1019":{"dur":2,"text":"Get it nice and close."},"1021":{"dur":7,"text":"Have you ever heard the saying, \"We'll fix\nit in post?\""},"1029":{"dur":5,"text":"It's like a film industry saying that is just\na recipe for a major hassle and what it basically"},"1035":{"dur":5,"text":"means is that if you're about to record something,\nand your situation isn't ideal, you know,"},"1040":{"dur":3,"text":"there's noise around or there's something\ndistracting or there's a light in the wrong"},"1044":{"dur":1,"text":"place."},"1045":{"dur":3,"text":"There's a real temptation to say, \"Oh you\nknow what, we'll sort it out in the editing,"},"1049":{"dur":1,"text":"it'll be fine.\""},"1050":{"dur":5,"text":"And I see that happen so often, even on professional\nshoots."},"1055":{"dur":5,"text":"So what I would really encourage you guys\nto do is take that bit of extra time to get"},"1061":{"dur":2,"text":"your situation just right before you start."},"1064":{"dur":3,"text":"I've heard sometimes people say, \"Oh we'll\njust run it through Auphonic and that will"},"1067":{"dur":2,"text":"clean it up and it'll be fine."},"1069":{"dur":5,"text":"Auphonic is a pretty cool tool, but the way\nthat sound mixing actually works is that it"},"1075":{"dur":2,"text":"removes frequencies from the sound."},"1077":{"dur":4,"text":"So you want to do as little as possible to\nyour material in the editing."},"1081":{"dur":4,"text":"So the better quality that you can get it\nat the start, the better it's going to end"},"1085":{"dur":2,"text":"up and the less hassle you're going to have."},"1087":{"dur":4,"text":"So, here are some tips to avoid having to\nfix it in post."},"1092":{"dur":5,"text":"This is really simple but it's another thing\nthat people get wrong all the time is reduce"},"1097":{"dur":1,"text":"background noise."},"1098":{"dur":2,"text":"So, this is an interview that I filmed at\na convention."},"1101":{"dur":4,"text":"There's people in the background walking around\nand there's noise, there's music."},"1105":{"dur":5,"text":"In this case it was OK because we wanted to\ncapture the atmosphere and the vibe of the"},"1111":{"dur":1,"text":"event."},"1112":{"dur":3,"text":"But if you're filming someone, go through\nsome questions in your mind like:"},"1115":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Am I in the ideal space to do it, sound-wise?\""},"1118":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Is there another room that's going to work\nbetter sound-wise?\""},"1121":{"dur":5,"text":"\"Can I close the window and eliminate traffic\nnoise from outside?\""},"1126":{"dur":4,"text":"Even something like air conditioning or the\nbuzz of a fridge or a computer."},"1130":{"dur":3,"text":"Eliminating all of these sounds is just going\nto give you a far more professional result."},"1134":{"dur":5,"text":"So, like if I said now, you know, what sound\nis there now?"},"1140":{"dur":1,"text":"There's nothing."},"1142":{"dur":5,"text":"But when you actually listen to the room,\nyou can start to hear there's a hum, there's"},"1147":{"dur":5,"text":"air conditioning, and our ears actually sort\nof filter out a lot of these sounds."},"1152":{"dur":3,"text":"So when you're going to start recording audio,\ntune in to that sort of thing."},"1156":{"dur":1,"text":"The other thing is echo."},"1157":{"dur":4,"text":"It's a real giveaway for amateur videos."},"1161":{"dur":7,"text":"So this is a closet and I believe Jake Hower\nrecords his Multimedia Marketing Show in a"},"1169":{"dur":4,"text":"closet and so I always picture him sort of\nhuddled up there but he gets really good sounds."},"1173":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I'm not saying film your news video in\na cupboard."},"1177":{"dur":1,"text":"You don't have to do that."},"1178":{"dur":7,"text":"But, what's... unless you're like a cupboard\nexpert then that will be the perfect location."},"1185":{"dur":1,"text":"But use that same idea."},"1187":{"dur":4,"text":"There's lots of soft materials which are going\nto absorb the sound to stop it from bouncing"},"1191":{"dur":1,"text":"around."},"1192":{"dur":6,"text":"So, if you're in a room that's got a lot of\nhard surfaces, no carpets, no curtains, you"},"1199":{"dur":5,"text":"can go DIY and just bring in like a mattress\nor a blanket or close the curtains and these"},"1205":{"dur":8,"text":"soft surfaces are going to avoid the sound\nbouncing around and reduce that echo."},"1213":{"dur":4,"text":"So I'm going to talk about lighting."},"1218":{"dur":3,"text":"And I talk about this idea of developing the\nfilmmaker's eye."},"1221":{"dur":5,"text":"I think there's two ways of seeing this: the\nway that a consumer sees and the way that"},"1227":{"dur":1,"text":"the creator sees."},"1228":{"dur":5,"text":"And we've talked a bit about consumption and\ncreation and sort of come to that idea that"},"1234":{"dur":1,"text":"we want to be creators."},"1236":{"dur":5,"text":"The way a filmmaker will watch a film is they'll\nsit there and actively ask themselves:"},"1241":{"dur":2,"text":"\"How has the director set...set this up?"},"1244":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Where are the lights?\""},"1245":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Why is he frame locked like that?\""},"1247":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Why has he gone for a wider shot rather than\na close up?\""},"1249":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Why has he chosen those colors?\""},"1252":{"dur":5,"text":"So, the best way to learn is to watch videos\nand film and look at photography."},"1257":{"dur":1,"text":"Start to analyze, you know."},"1259":{"dur":1,"text":"Why does that look good?"},"1260":{"dur":4,"text":"Why does that work? and how can I incorporate\nthat into my own videos?"},"1264":{"dur":5,"text":"And I think what James was talking about yesterday\non taking photos and using something like"},"1269":{"dur":6,"text":"this Camera Plus app or something similar\nand sharing those images."},"1275":{"dur":3,"text":"That's a way of starting to engage with these\nideas, and the more you do that, the more"},"1278":{"dur":5,"text":"you capture images and share them, the more\nyou develop your filmmaker's eye and artistic"},"1284":{"dur":3,"text":"view and that's going to have a huge effect\non your videos."},"1288":{"dur":3,"text":"So I ask myself: \"What's the light doing?\""},"1291":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Where's the light coming from?\""},"1292":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Is it direct light or is it reflected light?\""},"1296":{"dur":3,"text":"If you're outside on a sunny day, you're going\nto get harsh direct lights and are creating"},"1300":{"dur":1,"text":"shadows."},"1301":{"dur":4,"text":"If it's a cloudy day, it's going to be a nice,\nflattering soft light but the sun's going"},"1305":{"dur":3,"text":"to be going behind the clouds and in front\nof the clouds..."},"1309":{"dur":3,"text":"So, these are often things that when you start\noff you don't think about."},"1312":{"dur":4,"text":"But the more you tune in to what's happening,\nlight and sound-wise, you become aware of"},"1317":{"dur":1,"text":"it."},"1318":{"dur":4,"text":"It becomes an active choice, that's going\nto improve the quality of your video so dramatically."},"1323":{"dur":1,"text":"Think about color."},"1324":{"dur":7,"text":"You know, like color -- its psychology, its\nemotion, its vibrancy."},"1331":{"dur":6,"text":"How can you start to incorporate color into\nyour videos to affect people's mood and to"},"1338":{"dur":2,"text":"kind of enliven your videos?"},"1340":{"dur":5,"text":"(It's going to jump to the slide.)"},"1346":{"dur":1,"text":"This is three-point lighting."},"1348":{"dur":5,"text":"This is the classic way that you're going\nto light your videos so you can see... this"},"1353":{"dur":3,"text":"is a still from a video that I took."},"1357":{"dur":2,"text":"One side of his face is slightly brighter\nthan the other."},"1359":{"dur":3,"text":"And so you can see on the right hand side,\nthere's a slight shadow on his nose and there's"},"1363":{"dur":2,"text":"a bit of a shadow under his neck there."},"1365":{"dur":4,"text":"And what people often do in amateur videos\nis they'll just flood the person with lights."},"1370":{"dur":1,"text":"And they'll just look completely flat."},"1372":{"dur":5,"text":"Whereas here, there's more texture and it's\nlooking more like a 3D sort of image and..."},"1377":{"dur":3,"text":"maybe you can't even put your finger on it,\nbut it just looks more professional."},"1380":{"dur":6,"text":"With film, we're basically, or with video,\nwe're taking a two-dimensional image and try"},"1387":{"dur":2,"text":"to make it look three dimensional."},"1389":{"dur":4,"text":"So the third thing that you do is put a light\nat the back and you can see there's a little"},"1393":{"dur":4,"text":"bit of light just on the top of his head and\non his shoulder, and that's separating him"},"1398":{"dur":1,"text":"from the background."},"1399":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is the most important concept of lighting."},"1403":{"dur":4,"text":"So I want to show you this quick video just\nto embed this idea because once you master"},"1408":{"dur":3,"text":"this, your face-the-camera videos are going\nto look awesome."},"1411":{"dur":5,"text":"\"Alright so this is a quick video to show\nyou three-point lighting which is what I got"},"1417":{"dur":1,"text":"set up at the moment."},"1418":{"dur":4,"text":"So as you'll notice, this side of my face\nis slightly brighter, which is where the key"},"1422":{"dur":1,"text":"light is coming from."},"1424":{"dur":1,"text":"So I've got a light over there."},"1426":{"dur":4,"text":"This side of my face is slightly less bright\nand that's coming from the fill lights which"},"1430":{"dur":5,"text":"is up there, and directly behind me is the\nbacklight and you can see that that's creating"},"1435":{"dur":5,"text":"some light on my shoulder here and behind\nmy head which is separating me from the background."},"1441":{"dur":4,"text":"So I'm going to switch off these lights and\nshow you the effect as I switch on each one"},"1445":{"dur":2,"text":"so you can get a picture of how to create\nthree-point lighting."},"1448":{"dur":6,"text":"OK, so here I am, you can't see me but you\nwill as I start to switch on the lights and"},"1455":{"dur":1,"text":"see the effect of each individual light."},"1456":{"dur":4,"text":"So the first light we're going to switch on\nis the key light."},"1461":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's the brightest light which is lighting\nup half of my face here."},"1465":{"dur":5,"text":"So we'll now switch on the fill light which\nhas filled that side of my face."},"1470":{"dur":4,"text":"As you can see, slightly less bright than\nthe key light and that's giving us more of"},"1475":{"dur":1,"text":"a three-dimensional sort of effect."},"1477":{"dur":5,"text":"At the moment you can see that there's no\nreal separation between me and the background"},"1482":{"dur":3,"text":"which is what we're going to use the backlight\nfor, so we'll switch on the backlight now."},"1485":{"dur":6,"text":"OK, so we switched on a backlight on me and\na light that's on our background as well."},"1492":{"dur":4,"text":"So with the backlight you can see it's now\nseparated me from the background and by throwing"},"1496":{"dur":4,"text":"some light on the background as well, it's\ngiving a much better sense of the room and"},"1501":{"dur":2,"text":"how it looks and more depth."},"1503":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's basically how three-point lighting\nworks."},"1506":{"dur":6,"text":"Of course if you want to film something like\na confession or a police informer, then something"},"1513":{"dur":1,"text":"like this is perfect lighting."},"1514":{"dur":10,"text":"Put the backlight on with a disguise, your\nvoice using a funky filter like this one."},"1524":{"dur":2,"text":"(Audience claps)."},"1527":{"dur":4,"text":"My editor actually did that when I was on\nlunch and it surprised me."},"1531":{"dur":2,"text":"It's pretty cool."},"1534":{"dur":4,"text":"Makeup -- this is just an easy win."},"1538":{"dur":4,"text":"Just a little bit of matte foundation powder\non your nose and on your forehead."},"1543":{"dur":5,"text":"If you're embarrassed to go in to the chemists,\nlike you know, one of Ezra's online stores"},"1549":{"dur":2,"text":"or something like that."},"1551":{"dur":1,"text":"But the whole idea is to use it sparingly."},"1553":{"dur":4,"text":"We don't want the kind of like old school\npancake make up."},"1558":{"dur":4,"text":"The way to use it is if no one can actually\ndetect that you're using it, that's the correct"},"1562":{"dur":1,"text":"way to use it."},"1563":{"dur":5,"text":"And the reason why you do it is because whenever\nyou shine lights on people's skin, it's going"},"1569":{"dur":1,"text":"to reflect."},"1570":{"dur":1,"text":"It's going to look shiny."},"1571":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is just going to stop the shine."},"1575":{"dur":2,"text":"Framing."},"1577":{"dur":4,"text":"So often when people start with video, they\njust sort of plunk the camera down, stand"},"1581":{"dur":3,"text":"in front of it and they're so focused on the\ncontent and the message and that's all that"},"1585":{"dur":4,"text":"they're thinking about but you can make choices\nabout how you want to frame it up."},"1590":{"dur":3,"text":"Do you want it to be more of a close up shot\nlike we've got on the left there?"},"1593":{"dur":5,"text":"This is an interview that I did with Oscar\nwinner Shaun Tan, and we filmed it from two"},"1599":{"dur":3,"text":"angles; the one on the left hand side is a\nmedium close up."},"1603":{"dur":4,"text":"And you use a shot like that to convey more\nemotion and drama."},"1607":{"dur":4,"text":"It's much more about him and what's going\non for him and much less about the background."},"1612":{"dur":4,"text":"On the other shot, it's much wider and so\nwe can see him in context in his studio; you"},"1617":{"dur":4,"text":"can see his art materials, you can see all\nhis pictures and you really get a feeling"},"1621":{"dur":2,"text":"of what it's like for an artist there in the\nstudio."},"1624":{"dur":3,"text":"So, when you're filming, make a decision."},"1628":{"dur":3,"text":"Is your video going to be more about drama\nand emotion or are you going to go closer"},"1631":{"dur":5,"text":"in or are you going to give more context or\nare you going to mix both together?"},"1636":{"dur":4,"text":"This is a still of a video that I did with\na scientist Gus Nossal and when I arrived"},"1641":{"dur":2,"text":"to do the interview, they said, \"Oh we've\ngot a great room for you.\""},"1644":{"dur":6,"text":"They took me into this tiny little white room\nand if I'd filmed it in there, we would've"},"1650":{"dur":3,"text":"just had a white background and probably his\nshadow going onto the wall."},"1654":{"dur":3,"text":"So I found this other room and they agreed\nto let me film in the library."},"1657":{"dur":3,"text":"And it just looks so much better because I'm\ngiving context."},"1661":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm actually using framing as a storytelling\ndevice."},"1664":{"dur":6,"text":"And he's a wise, learned man, you know, so\nyou're in his library, you're listening to"},"1670":{"dur":1,"text":"him talking."},"1672":{"dur":4,"text":"Once you put someone in context, you're telling\na much better story."},"1676":{"dur":1,"text":"It's also about congruence and proof."},"1678":{"dur":2,"text":"So, here's a still from one of my news update\nvideos."},"1680":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm in the edit suite and you can see the\nediting computer behind me."},"1684":{"dur":1,"text":"I've chosen some nice colourful shots."},"1686":{"dur":4,"text":"I've made an active decision to put myself\nup there, not in front of the white background"},"1690":{"dur":1,"text":"or on the street or on the beach."},"1692":{"dur":4,"text":"So, when you choose to film your face the\ncamera videos: What background are you going"},"1697":{"dur":1,"text":"to use and why?"},"1698":{"dur":1,"text":"How are you going to use that to convey the\nstory?"},"1700":{"dur":3,"text":"How will you use it as a proof element?"},"1703":{"dur":2,"text":"And what will you choose that's going to be\ncongruent?"},"1706":{"dur":4,"text":"Because that's going to make your video much\nmore convincing and you're going to tell the"},"1710":{"dur":3,"text":"world much more about yourself that way."},"1713":{"dur":3,"text":"Eye level -- get the camera at eye level."},"1717":{"dur":2,"text":"If you like, right, lower it down too much."},"1720":{"dur":2,"text":"See how it looks kind of weird, he looks a\nbit imposing?"},"1722":{"dur":3,"text":"It's not a very flattering shot from low down."},"1725":{"dur":4,"text":"So always film your videos at eye level or\nslightly higher."},"1730":{"dur":5,"text":"There's a rule in filmmaking and photography\nand art and I don't know why it exists but"},"1736":{"dur":1,"text":"it's called the rule of thirds."},"1738":{"dur":6,"text":"Our minds are basically hard-wired just to\nfind certain things aesthetically pleasing"},"1744":{"dur":3,"text":"and so you see this type of picture repeated\nover and over again."},"1747":{"dur":5,"text":"The bottom third is the line that joins the\nbeach to the water and the top third is the"},"1753":{"dur":2,"text":"line that joins the land to the sea."},"1756":{"dur":4,"text":"And you'll see this type of framing repeated\nover and over in photography and film and"},"1761":{"dur":2,"text":"on Instagram."},"1763":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'll show you a quick video."},"1766":{"dur":3,"text":"This is just where we... this why our minds\nwork, this is what we find pleasing."},"1770":{"dur":2,"text":"\"This is a quick video about video framing\ncomposition."},"1773":{"dur":2,"text":"So remember we spoke about the rule of thirds\nbefore."},"1776":{"dur":2,"text":"So if we put a grid over the picture, like\nthis,"},"1778":{"dur":5,"text":"you'll notice that my eyes are at the level\nof two thirds of the frame like that."},"1784":{"dur":4,"text":"That's pretty much where you want someone's\neyes to sit in the framing."},"1788":{"dur":4,"text":"You'll also notice that there's just a small\namount of headroom at the top which is just"},"1792":{"dur":2,"text":"right because you don't want to have too much\nheadroom."},"1794":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm over here on the right-hand side of the\nframe which usually looks better than having"},"1799":{"dur":1,"text":"me in the

out."},"1823":{"dur":2,"text":"So notice the difference once I've done that."},"1825":{"dur":4,"text":"So now I've tidied up the background, put\nsome cool shots on the screen and it just"},"1830":{"dur":1,"text":"looks a lot more professional now."},"1832":{"dur":4,"text":"This is just a small thing but it's those\nlittle attention to detail areas that
