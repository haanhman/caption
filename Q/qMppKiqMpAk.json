around every star\nor almost every star,"},"26":{"dur":1,"text":"there's a planet,"},"27":{"dur":1,"text":"or probably a few."},"30":{"dur":2,"text":"So what this picture isn't showing you"},"32":{"dur":2,"text":"are all the planets that we know about"},"34":{"dur":1,"text":"out there in space."},"36":{"dur":3,"text":"But when we think about planets,\nwe tend to think of faraway things"},"39":{"dur":1,"text":"that are very different from our own."},"41":{"dur":2,"text":"But here we are on a planet,"},"43":{"dur":3,"text":"and there are so many things\nthat are amazing about Earth"},"47":{"dur":4,"text":"that we're searching far and wide\nto find things that are like that."},"51":{"dur":3,"text":"And when we're searching,\nwe're finding amazing things."},"54":{"dur":4,"text":"But I want to tell you\nabout an amazing thing here on Earth."},"59":{"dur":2,"text":"And that is that every minute,"},"61":{"dur":2,"text":"400 pounds of hydrogen"},"64":{"dur":2,"text":"and almost seven pounds of helium"},"66":{"dur":2,"text":"escape from Earth into space."},"70":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is gas that is going off\nand never coming back."},"75":{"dur":3,"text":"So hydrogen, helium and many other things"},"78":{"dur":2,"text":"make up what's known\nas the Earth's atmosphere."},"81":{"dur":3,"text":"The atmosphere is just these gases\nthat form a thin blue line"},"85":{"dur":3,"text":"that's seen here from\nthe International Space Station,"},"88":{"dur":2,"text":"a photograph that some astronauts took."},"91":{"dur":3,"text":"And this tenuous veneer around our planet"},"94":{"dur":2,"text":"is what allows life to flourish."},"96":{"dur":2,"text":"It protects our planet\nfrom too many impacts,"},"99":{"dur":2,"text":"from meteorites and the like."},"101":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's such an amazing phenomenon"},"105":{"dur":2,"text":"that the fact that it's disappearing"},"108":{"dur":2,"text":"should frighten you,\nat least a little bit."},"112":{"dur":3,"text":"So this process is something that I study"},"115":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's called atmospheric escape."},"118":{"dur":4,"text":"So atmospheric escape\nis not specific to planet Earth."},"123":{"dur":3,"text":"It's part of what it means\nto be a planet, if you ask me,"},"127":{"dur":4,"text":"because planets, not just here on Earth\nbut throughout the universe,"},"131":{"dur":2,"text":"can undergo atmospheric escape."},"134":{"dur":5,"text":"And the way it happens actually tells us\nabout planets themselves."},"139":{"dur":2,"text":"Because when you think\nabout the solar system,"},"142":{"dur":2,"text":"you might think about this picture here."},"145":{"dur":3,"text":"And you would say, well,\nthere are eight planets, maybe nine."},"149":{"dur":2,"text":"So for those of you\nwho are stressed by this picture,"},"151":{"dur":1,"text":"I will add somebody for you."},"153":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"154":{"dur":2,"text":"Courtesy of New Horizons,\nwe're including Pluto."},"158":{"dur":1,"text":"And the thing here is,"},"159":{"dur":2,"text":"for the purposes of this talk\nand atmospheric escape,"},"162":{"dur":2,"text":"Pluto is a planet in my mind,"},"164":{"dur":3,"text":"in the same way that planets\naround other stars that we can't see"},"168":{"dur":1,"text":"are also planets."},"169":{"dur":2,"text":"So fundamental characteristics of planets"},"172":{"dur":3,"text":"include the fact that they are bodies"},"175":{"dur":1,"text":"that are bound together by gravity."},"177":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's a lot of material\njust stuck together"},"180":{"dur":1,"text":"with this attractive force."},"182":{"dur":2,"text":"And these bodies are so big\nand have so much gravity."},"185":{"dur":1,"text":"That's why they're round."},"186":{"dur":1,"text":"So when you look at all of these,"},"188":{"dur":1,"text":"including Pluto,"},"189":{"dur":1,"text":"they're round."},"191":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can see that gravity\nis really at play here."},"193":{"dur":3,"text":"But another fundamental\ncharacteristic about planets"},"197":{"dur":1,"text":"is what you don't see here,"},"198":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's the star, the Sun,"},"201":{"dur":3,"text":"that all of the planets\nin the solar system are orbiting around."},"205":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's fundamentally driving\natmospheric escape."},"209":{"dur":5,"text":"The reason that fundamentally stars\ndrive atmospheric escape from planets"},"215":{"dur":5,"text":"is because stars offer planets\nparticles and light and heat"},"220":{"dur":3,"text":"that can cause the atmospheres to go away."},"223":{"dur":1,"text":"So if you think of a hot-air balloon,"},"225":{"dur":4,"text":"or you look at this picture\nof lanterns in Thailand at a festival,"},"229":{"dur":3,"text":"you can see that hot air\ncan propel gasses upward."},"233":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you have enough energy and heating,"},"235":{"dur":1,"text":"which our Sun does,"},"236":{"dur":3,"text":"that gas, which is so light\nand only bound by gravity,"},"240":{"dur":1,"text":"it can escape into space."},"243":{"dur":3,"text":"And so this is what's actually\ncausing atmospheric escape"},"247":{"dur":2,"text":"here on Earth and also on other planets --"},"250":{"dur":2,"text":"that interplay\nbetween heating from the star"},"253":{"dur":3,"text":"and overcoming the force\nof gravity on the planet."},"257":{"dur":1,"text":"So I've told you that it happens"},"258":{"dur":3,"text":"at the rate of 400 pounds\na minute for hydrogen"},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"and almost seven pounds for helium."},"265":{"dur":1,"text":"But what does that look like?"},"266":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, even in the '80s,"},"268":{"dur":1,"text":"we took pictures of the Earth"},"270":{"dur":1,"text":"in the ultraviolet"},"271":{"dur":2,"text":"using NASA's Dynamic Explorer spacecraft."},"274":{"dur":1,"text":"So these two images of the Earth"},"276":{"dur":3,"text":"show you what that glow\nof escaping hydrogen looks like,"},"280":{"dur":1,"text":"shown in red."},"281":{"dur":3,"text":"And you can also see other features\nlike oxygen and nitrogen"},"285":{"dur":1,"text":"in that white glimmer"},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"in the circle showing you the auroras"},"289":{"dur":2,"text":"and also some wisps around the tropics."},"292":{"dur":3,"text":"So these are pictures\nthat conclusively show us"},"295":{"dur":3,"text":"that our atmosphere isn't just\ntightly bound to us here on Earth"},"298":{"dur":3,"text":"but it's actually\nreaching out far into space,"},"302":{"dur":1,"text":"and at an alarming rate, I might add."},"305":{"dur":3,"text":"But the Earth is not alone\nin undergoing atmospheric escape."},"308":{"dur":3,"text":"Mars, our nearest neighbor,\nis much smaller than Earth,"},"312":{"dur":3,"text":"so it has much less gravity\nwith which to hold on to its atmosphere."},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"And so even though Mars has an atmosphere,"},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"we can see it's much thinner\nthan the Earth's."},"320":{"dur":1,"text":"Just look at the surface."},"322":{"dur":3,"text":"You see craters indicating\nthat it didn't have an atmosphere"},"325":{"dur":1,"text":"that could stop those impacts."},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"Also, we see that it's the \"red planet,\""},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"and atmospheric escape plays a role"},"332":{"dur":1,"text":"in Mars being red."},"334":{"dur":3,"text":"That's because we think\nMars used to have a wetter past,"},"338":{"dur":4,"text":"and when water had enough energy,\nit broke up into hydrogen and oxygen,"},"342":{"dur":3,"text":"and hydrogen being so light,\nit escaped into space,"},"346":{"dur":1,"text":"and the oxygen that was left"},"348":{"dur":1,"text":"oxidized or rusted the ground,"},"350":{"dur":3,"text":"making that familiar\nrusty red color that we see."},"354":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's fine to look at pictures of Mars"},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"and say that atmospheric escape\nprobably happened,"},"359":{"dur":4,"text":"but NASA has a probe that's currently\nat Mars called the MAVEN satellite,"},"363":{"dur":3,"text":"and its actual job\nis to study atmospheric escape."},"367":{"dur":4,"text":"It's the Mars Atmosphere\nand Volatile Evolution spacecraft."},"371":{"dur":3,"text":"And results from it have already\nshown pictures very similar"},"375":{"dur":1,"text":"to what you've seen here on Earth."},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"We've long known that Mars\nwas losing its atmosphere,"},"379":{"dur":1,"text":"but we have some stunning pictures."},"381":{"dur":3,"text":"Here, for example,\nyou can see in the red circle"},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"is the size of Mars,"},"386":{"dur":4,"text":"and in blue you can see the hydrogen\nescaping away from the planet."},"390":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's reaching out more than 10 times\nthe size of the planet,"},"394":{"dur":2,"text":"far enough away that it's\nno longer bound to that planet."},"396":{"dur":1,"text":"It's escaping off into space."},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"And this helps us confirm ideas,"},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"like why Mars is red,\nfrom that lost hydrogen."},"404":{"dur":2,"text":"But hydrogen isn't\nthe only gas that's lost."},"407":{"dur":3,"text":"I mentioned helium on Earth\nand some oxygen and nitrogen,"},"410":{"dur":3,"text":"and from MAVEN we can also look\nat the oxygen being lost from Mars."},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can see\nthat because oxygen is heavier,"},"416":{"dur":3,"text":"it can't get as far as the hydrogen,"},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"but it's still escaping\naway from the planet."},"421":{"dur":3,"text":"You don't see it all confined\ninto that red circle."},"425":{"dur":4,"text":"So the fact that we not only see\natmospheric escape on our own planet"},"429":{"dur":3,"text":"but we can study it elsewhere\nand send spacecraft"},"433":{"dur":3,"text":"allows us to learn\nabout the past of planets"},"436":{"dur":2,"text":"but also about planets in general"},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"and Earth's future."},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"So one way we actually\ncan learn about the future"},"443":{"dur":3,"text":"is by planets so far away\nthat we can't see."},"447":{"dur":3,"text":"And I should just note though,\nbefore I go on to that,"},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm not going to show you\nphotos like this of Pluto,"},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"which might be disappointing,"},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"but that's because we don't have them yet."},"456":{"dur":3,"text":"But the New Horizons mission\nis currently studying atmospheric escape"},"459":{"dur":1,"text":"being lost from the planet."},"461":{"dur":1,"text":"So stay tuned and look out for that."},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"But the planets\nthat I did want to talk about"},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"are known as transiting exoplanets."},"468":{"dur":3,"text":"So any planet orbiting a star\nthat's not our Sun"},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"is called an exoplanet,\nor extrasolar planet."},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"And these planets that we call transiting"},"477":{"dur":1,"text":"have the special feature"},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"that if you look\nat that star in the middle,"},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"you'll see that actually it's blinking."},"483":{"dur":1,"text":"And the reason that it's blinking"},"484":{"dur":4,"text":"is because there are planets\nthat are going past it all the time,"},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's that special orientation"},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"where the planets are blocking\nthe light from the star"},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"that allows us to see that light blinking."},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"And by surveying the stars\nin the night sky"},"499":{"dur":1,"text":"for this blinking motion,"},"501":{"dur":1,"text":"we are able to find planets."},"502":{"dur":4,"text":"This is how we've now been able\nto detect over 5,000 planets"},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"in our own Milky Way,"},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"and we know there are\nmany more out there, like I mentioned."},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"So when we look at the light\nfrom these stars,"},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"what we see, like I said,\nis not the planet itself,"},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"but you actually see\na dimming of the light"},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"that we can record in time."},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"So the light drops as the planet\ndecreases in front of the star,"},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's that blinking\nthat you saw before."},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"So not only do we detect the planets"},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"but we can look at this light\nin different wavelengths."},"532":{"dur":4,"text":"So I mentioned looking at the Earth\nand Mars in ultraviolet light."},"536":{"dur":3,"text":"If we look at transiting exoplanets\nwith the Hubble Space Telescope,"},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"we find that in the ultraviolet,"},"541":{"dur":3,"text":"you see much bigger blinking,\nmuch less light from the star,"},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"when the planet is passing in front."},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"And we think this is because you have\nan extended atmosphere of hydrogen"},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"all around the planet"},"552":{"dur":1,"text":"that's making it look puffier"},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"and thus blocking\nmore of the light that you see."},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"So using this technique,\nwe've actually been able to discover"},"559":{"dur":4,"text":"a few transiting exoplanets\nthat are undergoing atmospheric escape."},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"And these planets\ncan be called hot Jupiters,"},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"for some of the ones we've found."},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's because\nthey're gas planets like Jupiter,"},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"but they're so close to their star,"},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"about a hundred times closer than Jupiter."},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"And because there's all this\nlightweight gas that's ready to escape,"},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"and all this heating from the star,"},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"you have completely catastrophic rates\nof atmospheric escape."},"584":{"dur":4,"text":"So unlike our 400 pounds per minute\nof hydrogen being lost on Earth,"},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"for these planets,"},"590":{"dur":4,"text":"you're losing 1.3 billion\npounds of hydrogen every minute."},"595":{"dur":4,"text":"So you might think, well,\ndoes this make the planet cease to exist?"},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is a question\nthat people wondered"},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"when they looked at our solar system,"},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"because planets\ncloser to the Sun are rocky,"},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"and planets further away\nare bigger and more gaseous."},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"Could you have started\nwith something like Jupiter"},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"that was actually close to the Sun,"},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"and get rid of all the gas in it?"},"614":{"dur":3,"text":"We now think that if you start\nwith something like a hot Jupiter,"},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"you actually can't end up\nwith Mercury or the Earth."},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"But if you started with something smaller,"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"it's possible that enough gas\nwould have gotten away"},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"that it would have\nsignificantly impacted it"},"627":{"dur":3,"text":"and left you with something very different\nthan what you started with."},"631":{"dur":1,"text":"So all of this sounds sort of general,"},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"and we might think about the solar system,"},"635":{"dur":2,"text":"but what does this have to do\nwith us here on Earth?"},"638":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, in the far future,"},"640":{"dur":2,"text":"the Sun is going to get brighter."},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"And as that happens,"},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"the heating that we find from the Sun\nis going to become very intense."},"647":{"dur":4,"text":"In the same way that you see\ngas streaming off from a hot Jupiter,"},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"gas is going to stream off from the Earth."},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"And so what we can look forward to,"},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"or at least prepare for,"},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"is the fact that in the far future,"},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"the Earth is going to look more like Mars."},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"Our hydrogen, from water\nthat is broken down,"},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"is going to escape\ninto space more rapidly,"},"668":{"dur":4,"text":"and we're going to be left\nwith this dry, reddish planet."},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"So don't fear, it's not\nfor a few billion years,"},"675":{"dur":1,"text":"so there's some time to prepare."},"677":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"But I wanted you\nto be aware of what's going on,"},"681":{"dur":1,"text":"not just in the future,"},"682":{"dur":3,"text":"but atmospheric escape\nis happening as we speak."},"685":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's a lot of amazing science\nthat you hear about happening in space"},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"and planets that are far away,"},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"and we are studying these planets\nto learn about these worlds."},"694":{"dur":4,"text":"But as we learn about Mars\nor exoplanets like hot Jupiters,"},"698":{"dur":3,"text":"we find things like atmospheric escape"},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"that tell us a lot more\nabout our planet here on Earth."},"705":{"dur":4,"text":"So consider that the next time\nyou think that space is far away."},"709":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you."},"711":{"dur":3,"text":"(Applause)"}}
