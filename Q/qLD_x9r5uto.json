anyway."},"14":{"dur":1,"text":"First up, books."},"16":{"dur":2,"text":"We had another very heavy\nmonth for Banging Book Club,"},"19":{"dur":2,"text":"which meant my whole month was taken up"},"22":{"dur":1,"text":"reading our book club book,"},"24":{"dur":3,"text":"which was Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov."},"27":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, it's beautifully written,"},"28":{"dur":2,"text":"and I can see why it is a classic,"},"31":{"dur":2,"text":"but it was hard to read"},"33":{"dur":3,"text":"because of all of the\npedophilia, basically."},"37":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, that's just it,\nbecause of the pedophilia,"},"39":{"dur":1,"text":"it was difficult to read."},"40":{"dur":2,"text":"I haven't quite collected\nall my thoughts on it,"},"43":{"dur":3,"text":"but if you do wanna hear more thoughts,"},"46":{"dur":3,"text":"then the Banging Book Club\npodcast discussing this"},"49":{"dur":3,"text":"and video will be up\nfairly soon after this,"},"53":{"dur":1,"text":"so I will link them in the description"},"55":{"dur":2,"text":"and I will tweet them out\nwhen they're ready and up."},"57":{"dur":2,"text":"One thing I will say is that\ngoing into reading this,"},"59":{"dur":2,"text":"I did not know that it was written"},"62":{"dur":2,"text":"from the man's perspective."},"64":{"dur":3,"text":"I didn't know that it was\ngonna be first person."},"67":{"dur":3,"text":"And that just confuses\nyou, and it's conflicting,"},"71":{"dur":4,"text":"and you don't really, like\nthe book is called Lolita,"},"75":{"dur":2,"text":"but you don't really ever\nreally ever get to see"},"78":{"dur":2,"text":"what's going on with her\nand how she's dealing"},"80":{"dur":2,"text":"with everything and how she feels."},"82":{"dur":2,"text":"Ugh, that's that for books."},"85":{"dur":1,"text":"Next up, films."},"86":{"dur":2,"text":"We are slowing edging into Oscar season,"},"89":{"dur":2,"text":"which means a lot of good films are out,"},"92":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's very exciting."},"93":{"dur":2,"text":"So, in November I saw Arrival,"},"96":{"dur":3,"text":"which is a film about\naliens that come to Earth,"},"100":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's about Amy Adams's character"},"102":{"dur":1,"text":"who's a linguistic expert,"},"104":{"dur":4,"text":"and she is sent in to try and\ncommunicate with the aliens"},"108":{"dur":1,"text":"and learn their language"},"109":{"dur":3,"text":"and figure out why the\nhell that they're on Earth."},"112":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's all I can really tell you,"},"114":{"dur":1,"text":"because it's so good."},"116":{"dur":1,"text":"It's so gripping."},"117":{"dur":2,"text":"Arrival, amazing film."},"120":{"dur":3,"text":"It was just like a whole\nexperience, incredible."},"123":{"dur":3,"text":"Next I went to see I, Daniel Blake,"},"126":{"dur":2,"text":"which is about a man, Daniel Blake,"},"129":{"dur":3,"text":"who has a heart attack,\nand he is on benefits"},"133":{"dur":1,"text":"because he can't go back to work,"},"134":{"dur":2,"text":"but then the health inspector\ndeems him fit for work"},"137":{"dur":3,"text":"when his doctors don't, and\nso he's trying to appeal that,"},"141":{"dur":2,"text":"because he's then having to\ngo on Jobseeker's Allowance,"},"144":{"dur":1,"text":"but he can't, he's not a jobseeker,"},"145":{"dur":1,"text":"'cause he can't actually work,"},"146":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's like this whole benefits thing."},"148":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's also about this\nfriend that he makes"},"151":{"dur":4,"text":"who is a single mother of\ntwo, and she's been sanctioned"},"156":{"dur":1,"text":"'cause she was like five\nminutes late to an appointment,"},"158":{"dur":1,"text":"so she's not getting her benefits."},"159":{"dur":4,"text":"It is about the bureaucracy of\nthe benefit system in the UK,"},"164":{"dur":2,"text":"about how people aren't treated as people"},"167":{"dur":2,"text":"and are just treated as\nnumbers and statistics"},"169":{"dur":3,"text":"and markers to reach in the system,"},"172":{"dur":2,"text":"and it is heartbreaking."},"175":{"dur":1,"text":"I sobbed."},"176":{"dur":2,"text":"I was crying so much."},"179":{"dur":2,"text":"It made me so angry."},"181":{"dur":1,"text":"To be honest, the film itself"},"182":{"dur":2,"text":"is very much anti-Tory propaganda."},"185":{"dur":3,"text":"My mum actually works in welfare\nand in the benefit system,"},"189":{"dur":3,"text":"and she does all of the\ntribunals and appeals"},"193":{"dur":0,"text":"and that kind of thing,"},"194":{"dur":1,"text":"and I was speaking to her about the film,"},"195":{"dur":2,"text":"and she was just like,\n\"No, it's pretty accurate.\""},"197":{"dur":2,"text":"That's what happens, basically."},"200":{"dur":3,"text":"(exhales) And also, just\nmassive kudos to my mum,"},"203":{"dur":2,"text":"'cause I always knew what she did,"},"205":{"dur":1,"text":"but I never like knew what she did,"},"207":{"dur":3,"text":"and so that film, I was\njust like, \"Oh, my mum works"},"211":{"dur":4,"text":"\"with some of the most\nvulnerable people in the country"},"215":{"dur":2,"text":"\"and has to kind of like watch\nthem getting screwed over"},"217":{"dur":2,"text":"\"by the government every day.\""},"219":{"dur":0,"text":"That must be hard."},"220":{"dur":3,"text":"If Daniel Blake is still\nin cinemas where you live,"},"224":{"dur":1,"text":"please go see it."},"225":{"dur":1,"text":"It's so important."},"226":{"dur":2,"text":"It's just incredible."},"228":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah, go watch it."},"229":{"dur":3,"text":"And the other film I went to\ngo see, another Amy Adams film,"},"233":{"dur":2,"text":"Nocturnal Animals, and oh boy."},"235":{"dur":3,"text":"I was actually quite scared\nof going to see it by myself,"},"238":{"dur":4,"text":"because the trailer looked\nquite jumpy and thrilleresque."},"244":{"dur":3,"text":"Nocturnal Animals is about\nthis woman, Amy Adams,"},"247":{"dur":2,"text":"and her ex-husband sends her a manuscript"},"249":{"dur":1,"text":"of this novel that he's written,"},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"and the novel is horrific."},"254":{"dur":2,"text":"And in the film you kind of get"},"256":{"dur":1,"text":"to see the novel playing out,"},"258":{"dur":4,"text":"as well as her reading it and\nhow reading it affecting her."},"262":{"dur":4,"text":"It's just twisted and\ndevastating and (groans) violent."},"268":{"dur":1,"text":"Mm, but it was so good."},"270":{"dur":1,"text":"It was really, really good."},"271":{"dur":2,"text":"I've got some TV favorites\nas well this month."},"273":{"dur":3,"text":"First of all, Black Mirror,\nnew series of Black Mirror."},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"Six new episodes on Netflix all at once,"},"278":{"dur":1,"text":"and I was like, \"I don't\nknow what to do with myself!\""},"280":{"dur":3,"text":"Every episode of Black Mirror\nis a self-contained story,"},"284":{"dur":2,"text":"but the general thing that\nties them all together is"},"286":{"dur":3,"text":"that it is about people\nand about technology."},"289":{"dur":1,"text":"It's every so slightly set in the future,"},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"so the technology that they have"},"293":{"dur":2,"text":"is every so slightly futuristic"},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"but very much based on\nthings that we already have,"},"298":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's why it makes it so realistic,"},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"'cause it's kind of saying,\n\"Ooh, look, this could happen."},"304":{"dur":1,"text":"\"We could get there.\""},"305":{"dur":2,"text":"Often it's dark, really dark."},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"Ultimately, I feel like\nBlack Mirror is a series"},"310":{"dur":3,"text":"about people, because\nalthough the technology"},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"is different from what we have now,"},"315":{"dur":4,"text":"the social issues and\nthe things that people do"},"320":{"dur":3,"text":"with that technology is the\nsame as what's going on now."},"324":{"dur":1,"text":"It just gets heightened."},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"It's just very interesting,\nvery political."},"327":{"dur":3,"text":"Makes you kind of take a step\nback and look at our society"},"330":{"dur":1,"text":"and be like, \"Is this where we're headed?\""},"332":{"dur":1,"text":"Would recommend."},"333":{"dur":1,"text":"Let me think, favorite episodes."},"335":{"dur":4,"text":"Favorite episodes of the new\nseries, obviously San Juniper,"},"339":{"dur":2,"text":"but I think my favorite episodes in terms"},"342":{"dur":4,"text":"of what shocked me the most is\nthe episode with the soldier,"},"346":{"dur":1,"text":"the soldier and the roaches."},"348":{"dur":1,"text":"On a happier note, I binge watched a show"},"350":{"dur":2,"text":"called Lovesick on Netflix recently."},"353":{"dur":2,"text":"It was originally called Scrotal Recall,"},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"but that didn't really catch on."},"358":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't know why, weird."},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"But Netflix bought it\nand renamed it Lovesick."},"363":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's about this guy who gets chlamydia"},"366":{"dur":3,"text":"and then has to go back\nthrough all of his ex-partners"},"369":{"dur":4,"text":"and tell them, and\nhilarity ensues, so yeah."},"373":{"dur":1,"text":"But yeah, it's wonderful."},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a super funny show."},"376":{"dur":3,"text":"There are two seasons\nof it on Netflix now,"},"380":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's super easy."},"381":{"dur":2,"text":"The episodes are 20 minutes long each,"},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"and the seasons are really short."},"386":{"dur":3,"text":"And I finished it, and I'm\njust like, \"More, more please.\""},"389":{"dur":4,"text":"And my final TV favorite in\nNovember is Planet Earth II."},"393":{"dur":1,"text":"Planet Earth is back, David Attenborough,"},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"nature documentaries, and the shots,"},"397":{"dur":3,"text":"oh my God, the shots are incredible."},"401":{"dur":1,"text":"I can't handle it."},"402":{"dur":4,"text":"I don't watch live TV, but for\nthe last two weeks in a row,"},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm like, \"Sunday night, eight p.m."},"408":{"dur":1,"text":"\"It's Planet Earth time.\" (laughs)"},"410":{"dur":1,"text":"Who have I become? (laughs)"},"411":{"dur":1,"text":"My mother, mm, yeah, that would be it."},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"Next, a bunch of music favorites."},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"Loads of cool new music\ncame out this month"},"417":{"dur":1,"text":"that I really like,"},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"and two of them are my\nfriends, not biased."},"421":{"dur":3,"text":"But first of all, Tove\nLo's album, Lady Wood."},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"(exclaims) Oh my God."},"425":{"dur":4,"text":"And I got to go to this\nparty-launch thing for her album,"},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"and she was there performing\nand she took her top off"},"433":{"dur":3,"text":"and she had marijuana leaf\nstickers on her nipples,"},"436":{"dur":2,"text":"and I was just like, \"Oh my God.\""},"438":{"dur":0,"text":"Whew."},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"The album is incredible."},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"It's just really good pop music."},"444":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's very political as well,"},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"'cause when you hear her do interviews"},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"and talk about the album,"},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"it's all about female sexuality"},"450":{"dur":1,"text":"and kind of being uninhibited"},"452":{"dur":3,"text":"and it being sexuality for yourself"},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"and not for other people."},"457":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay, favorite songs on the\nalbum are probably True Disaster"},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"and What the Fuck Love Is."},"463":{"dur":4,"text":"Next, Bry's album is out,\nself-titled album, Bry."},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"It's his debut album, and\nhe's worked so hard on it."},"471":{"dur":1,"text":"And I listened to it,"},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"and I was nervous I wasn't\ngonna like it, but I love it."},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"I also the fact that you\ncan hear his Irish accent"},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"when he's singing, because\npeople often lose that,"},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"but no, it's there."},"481":{"dur":3,"text":"My favorite songs on the\nalbum, I think, at the moment,"},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"are Hope You're Listening\nand You're Alright."},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"And my final musical favorite is dodie,"},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"dodie with a lowercase d."},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"Her EP, Intertwined, oh my God."},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"That girl, so talented, so talented."},"499":{"dur":4,"text":"I think my favorite\nsong on the EP is When."},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"It's just stunning."},"505":{"dur":1,"text":"It's so stunning."},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"Dodes, you're so frickin' talented."},"509":{"dur":1,"text":"So proud of you."},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"And I love how the song When,"},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"which is the last song on the EP,"},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"kind of contradicts some of the emotions"},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"that she's singing\nabout in previous songs."},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"I like that a lot, very clever."},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"Now we're moving on to a\nsection called miscellaneous,"},"523":{"dur":1,"text":"because I've got a few extra things"},"525":{"dur":1,"text":"that I don't know where to put 'em."},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"At the beginning of November,"},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"it was the Cosmopolitan Influencer Awards,"},"531":{"dur":3,"text":"and thanks to you guys for nominating me,"},"534":{"dur":4,"text":"I was shortlisted for Best Sex\nand Relationships Influencer,"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"so, ha, thank you for that."},"541":{"dur":1,"text":"And I won it."},"542":{"dur":1,"text":"I won it!"},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"(squeals)"},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I have this beautiful thing."},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"It says, \"Winner, Best Sex\nand Relationships Influencer.\""},"551":{"dur":3,"text":"But what I like to do is\nkind of like cover it up"},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"so it just says, \"Winner,\nBest Sex.\" (clicks tongue)"},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"So, genuinely, thank you so much"},"558":{"dur":1,"text":"to everyone who nominated me, ah!"},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"Another miscellaneous thing\nthat I have been loving"},"563":{"dur":1,"text":"in November is a bit weird,"},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"but basically switching off the Internet"},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"and giving myself proper weekends."},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"I wrote a whole blog post about this"},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"that I will link in the description."},"573":{"dur":3,"text":"I forced myself offline for\nlike 48 hours, and it was great."},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"And since then, I kind of\nhave been relying on it less."},"581":{"dur":3,"text":"I've also, in terms of work,\nbeen giving myself weekends off"},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"and giving myself proper weekends,"},"587":{"dur":1,"text":"which has been doing wonders"},"588":{"dur":3,"text":"for my mental and emotional\nhealth, so that's great."},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"And the final miscellaneous thing"},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"is that YouTube have rolled out"},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"onto this channel a new feature"},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"where there are love\nheart things on comments."},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"So, before I would just\nbe liking comments,"},"606":{"dur":3,"text":"but you guys didn't know\nthat that was me liking them."},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"It just looked like it could\nhave been anyone liking it."},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"But not there's a love heart thing,"},"613":{"dur":3,"text":"so I can go ahead and love heart comments"},"617":{"dur":1,"text":"and you know that that's me being like,"},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I like it, I like it.\""},"619":{"dur":1,"text":"'Cause I can't reply to every comment,"},"621":{"dur":1,"text":"but I do read them all."},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"And then there's another feature"},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"where I can pin a comment to the top,"},"627":{"dur":3,"text":"and the idea of this is to\nkind of make the comments"},"630":{"dur":1,"text":"a safer place so there's less harassment."},"632":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I can put to the top and\nshowcase the kinds of comments"},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"that are welcome here."},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"All right, that is it for\nmy November favorites."},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you guys so much for watching."},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"Please give the video a\nthumbs up if you enjoyed it,"},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"and
