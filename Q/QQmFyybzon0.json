data,"},"47":{"dur":3,"text":"and data is just a fancy\nway of saying, like, files."},"50":{"dur":2,"text":"So files, of course, are just\ncollections of zeros and ones,"},"53":{"dur":4,"text":"and in those zeros and ones, odds are,\nare numbers like financial information,"},"57":{"dur":2,"text":"or photographs that\nyou've taken on vacation,"},"59":{"dur":4,"text":"or maybe it's financial

anything"},"69":{"dur":3,"text":"you don't want someone to see, you\nmaybe are in the habit of deleting it."},"73":{"dur":2,"text":"But let's consider first\nwhat it means to be

a\nphysical device, something like this."},"83":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's magnetic particles\non this particular device"},"85":{"dur":1,"text":"that represent our data."},"87":{"dur":3,"text":"So what does it mean,\nthough, to delete a file?"},"90":{"dur":2,"text":"On Macs and PCs and the\nlike, when you delete a file,"},"93":{"dur":3,"text":"it simply disappears, typically,\nfrom your desktop

something"},"110":{"dur":2,"text":"like this, although ideally\nit would be a perfect circle"},"112":{"dur":1,"text":"so that it can spin properly."},"114":{"dur":3,"text":"And anytime you store a file, you\nmight allocate some part of this disk,"},"117":{"dur":1,"text":"maybe that part of the\ndisk, or the platter,"},"119":{"dur":2,"text":"so to speak, for all\nof your zeros and ones."},"122":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'll just go ahead and draw\nsome random zeros and ones up here."},"125":{"dur":2,"text":"And what those zeros and ones are\ncompletely depend on the

knows?"},"132":{"dur":1,"text":"And then elsewhere on the platter--"},"134":{"dur":2,"text":"and recall that there might\nbe multiple platters--"},"136":{"dur":1,"text":"will there be any number of other files."},"138":{"dur":3,"text":"And even if it's not a platter, if\nit's instead a solid-state disk,"},"141":{"dur":2,"text":"electronically, are there\nstill these zeros and ones,"},"144":{"dur":5,"text":"thanks to the tiny little devices\nthat store those binary values for us."},"149":{"dur":4,"text":"But what does it mean, now, if a\nfile exists in your operating

drive,"},"159":{"dur":1,"text":"or electronically in an SSD?"},"161":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, somehow, your computer,\nspecifically your operating system,"},"164":{"dur":3,"text":"needs to keep track

what you might be thinking."},"222":{"dur":3,"text":"Wait a minute, it goes into the\nso-called recycle bin or trash can."},"225":{"dur":3,"text":"But the funny thing about the\nrecycle bin or trash

bin"},"236":{"dur":2,"text":"or recycle bin, because\nwhat can they do?"},"239":{"dur":1,"text":"They can, of course, just\ndouble click on the thing,"},"240":{"dur":3,"text":"drag the file out, and

the lid of the can."},"255":{"dur":1,"text":"And you might think, whew!"},"256":{"dur":1,"text":"Got rid of that file."},"257":{"dur":1,"text":"No one can now see it."},"259":{"dur":4,"text":"But consider what might be happening\nunderneath the hood, so to speak."},"263":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, it turns out what\na computer typically"},"266":{"dur":4,"text":"does, whether it's Windows or Mac\nOS or some other operating system,"},"270":{"dur":3,"text":"is it does nothing to the\nphysical device over here."},"273":{"dur":5,"text":"Instead, it just forgets\nthat entry from this

123."},"287":{"dur":3,"text":"Sure, there are still zeros and\nones from my old resume there."},"290":{"dur":2,"text":"But no big deal, because\nthe computer can just"},"293":{"dur":2,"text":"rearrange those zeros\nand ones into other ones"},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"and zeros in some other pattern\nand store some other file,"},"298":{"dur":4,"text":"so long as that new file\nis added to this table."},"302":{"dur":3,"text":"But the implication, then,\nis that even though you've"},"305":{"dur":2,"text":"deleted a file by dragging it\nto the recycle bin or trash can,"},"308":{"dur":4,"text":"and you've had the wherewithal to\nempty the recycle bin or trash can,"},"312":{"dur":3,"text":"the computer really is just\nforgetting where that file is."},"315":{"dur":3,"text":"It's not actually physically\ndestroying the data."},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"And so if you have the\nright software, or you"},"320":{"dur":3,"text":"have a sophisticated

really"},"342":{"dur":3,"text":"don't want other people to be able\nto see that, because it's personal,"},"346":{"dur":3,"text":"it's not sufficient, it seems, just\nto even empty your recycle bin."},"349":{"dur":3,"text":"You need to somehow\nsecurely erase this file, so"},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"that programs like Norton\nUtilities and other tools"},"354":{"dur":2,"text":"can't recover the data subsequently."},"357":{"dur":1,"text":"So what could you do?"},"359":{"dur":1,"text":"What would the approach be?"},"361":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, you might think that\nyou maybe open up the file"},"364":{"dur":3,"text":"and then just start typing random\nnumbers or letters into the file,"},"367":{"dur":3,"text":"resave it, and that might overwrite\nsome of those same zeros and ones."},"370":{"dur":1,"text":"But the operating system,\nfrankly, might just"},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"use a different part of the\ndisk to save that new data,"},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"especially if there's some kind\nof auto-recovery feature built"},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"into the file format itself."},"379":{"dur":1,"text":"So that might not be secure."},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"Really, you need to scrub--"},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"or wipe, as people say--"},"384":{"dur":0,"text":"these zeros and ones."},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe they should be\nchanged all to ones, or all"},"387":{"dur":4,"text":"to zeros, or maybe just random zeros and\nones, so that no matter what was there"},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"is absolutely now no longer there."},"394":{"dur":2,"text":"And for that, frankly,\nyou need special software."},"396":{"dur":3,"text":"And there do exist both commercial\nand free tools to do that,"},"399":{"dur":3,"text":"either to securely\ndelete individual

you--"},"422":{"dur":1,"text":"or someone else has deleted it on you."},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"And so it's actually\nkind of a nice thing"},"425":{"dur":3,"text":"that computers don't actually,\nby

thing."},"434":{"dur":1,"text":"And frankly, years ago,\nfor efficiency, it just"},"436":{"dur":2,"text":"made sense for computers to\nforget where the file is,"},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"rather than

work?"},"622":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, consider this."},"623":{"dur":6,"text":"This is a very simple HTTP request that\nmight go from a browser to a server."},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"Get slash, so get me

going\nto reply, hopefully with a HTTP 200,"},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"OK, all is well."},"643":{"dur":4,"text":"But it can also reply with some other\nvalues in those so-called HTTP headers."},"648":{"dur":6,"text":"For instance, a web server can reply\nnot only with that 200, OK, all is well,"},"654":{"dur":4,"text":"it can also reply with another\nheader below it called set-cookie."},"659":{"dur":4,"text":"And then inside of that is a value, a\nkey-value pair-- the name of the key,"},"663":{"dur":3,"text":"which in this case is Session, which is\ncommonly used, but

about,"},"2386":{"dur":1,"text":"is a password or a passcode."},"2387":{"dur":1,"text":"It's something you know."},"2388":{"dur":2,"text":"And historically, we\nhave used something

second password,"},"2420":{"dur":4,"text":"which is at risk for the same exact\nthreats, but something you have."},"2425":{"dur":2,"text":"So this thing here is\nliterally something"},"2427":{"dur":3,"text":"you would carry around on your\nkeychain, made by a company called RSA,"},"2430":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's got a battery and a\nlittle computational

so."},"2441":{"dur":2,"text":"And it does so on a schedule."},"2443":{"dur":2,"text":"So theoretically, it stays\nsynchronized with a server."},"2446":{"dur":2,"text":"Indeed, there's a

really raises the bar."},"2510":{"dur":4,"text":"It does not stop a hacker from\ntaking or guessing my password."},"2514":{"dur":2,"text":"And it certainly doesn't\nstop them from physically"},"2516":{"dur":3,"text":"going after the device I have on me."},"2520":{"dur":1,"text":"But it does raise the bar."},"2521":{"dur":3,"text":"And at least I'm a little less\nworried about
