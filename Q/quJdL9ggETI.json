matter."},"152":{"dur":1,"text":"Here's a really good example of how"},"154":{"dur":3,"text":"a very tiny design element can make a big impact."},"158":{"dur":3,"text":"The team at Facebook that

constraints"},"180":{"dur":1,"text":"for the design of this button."},"182":{"dur":3,"text":"You had to work within specific\nheight and width parameters."},"185":{"dur":2,"text":"You had to be

butt."},"201":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, this is the new version of the button,"},"203":{"dur":2,"text":"and the designer who led this project estimates"},"206":{"dur":3,"text":"that he spent over 280

small?"},"217":{"dur":1,"text":"It's because when you're designing at scale,"},"219":{"dur":3,"text":"there's no such thing as a small detail."},"222":{"dur":1,"text":"This innocent little

products,"},"241":{"dur":2,"text":"you need to get even the tiny things right."},"244":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, the next thing that you need to understand"},"246":{"dur":2,"text":"is how to design with data."},"249":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, when you're working on products like this,"},"250":{"dur":2,"text":"you have incredible amounts of information"},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"about how people are using your product"},"255":{"dur":1,"text":"that you can then use to influence"},"257":{"dur":1,"text":"your design decisions,"},"258":{"dur":2,"text":"but it's not just as simple as following the numbers."},"261":{"dur":1,"text":"Let me give you an example"},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"so that you can understand what I mean."},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"Facebook has had a tool for a long time"},"267":{"dur":2,"text":"that allowed people to report photos"},"269":{"dur":2,"text":"that may be in violation of our community standards,"},"272":{"dur":2,"text":"things like spam and abuse."},"274":{"dur":2,"text":"And there were a ton of photos reported,"},"276":{"dur":1,"text":"but as it turns out,"},"278":{"dur":1,"text":"only a small percentage were actually"},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"in violation of those community standards."},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"Most of them were just your typical party photo."},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, to give you a specific hypothetical example,"},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"let's say my friend Laura hypothetically"},"291":{"dur":1,"text":"uploads a picture of me"},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"from a drunken night of

Facebook?"},"308":{"dur":1,"text":"Do you know how hard that is to avoid"},"310":{"dur":3,"text":"when you actually work at Facebook?"},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"So anyway, there are lots of these photos"},"316":{"dur":3,"text":"being erroneously reported as spam and abuse,"},"319":{"dur":2,"text":"and one of the engineers on the team had a hunch."},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"He really thought there was something else going on"},"324":{"dur":1,"text":"and he was right,"},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"because when he looked\nthrough a bunch of the cases,"},"327":{"dur":1,"text":"he found that most of them"},"329":{"dur":1,"text":"were from people who were requesting"},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"the takedown of a photo of themselves."},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"Now this was a scenario that the team"},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"never even took into account before."},"338":{"dur":1,"text":"So they added a new feature"},"340":{"dur":2,"text":"that allowed people to message their friend"},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"to ask them to take the photo down."},"344":{"dur":1,"text":"But it didn't work."},"346":{"dur":1,"text":"Only 20 percent of people"},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"sent the message to their friend."},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"So the team went back at it."},"351":{"dur":3,"text":"They consulted with experts in conflict resolution."},"355":{"dur":3,"text":"They even studied the universal principles"},"358":{"dur":1,"text":"of polite language,"},"359":{"dur":1,"text":"which I didn't even actually know existed"},"361":{"dur":1,"text":"until this research happened."},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"And they found something really interesting."},"365":{"dur":2,"text":"They had to go beyond just helping people"},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"ask their friend to take the photo down."},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"They had to help people express to their friend"},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"how the photo made them feel."},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"Here's how the experience works today."},"377":{"dur":3,"text":"So I find this hypothetical photo of myself,"},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's not spam, it's not abuse,"},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"but I really wish it weren't on the site."},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"So I report it and I say,"},"388":{"dur":2,"text":"\"I'm in this photo and I don't like it,\""},"390":{"dur":3,"text":"and then we dig deeper."},"394":{"dur":2,"text":"Why don't you like this photo of yourself?"},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"And I select \"It's embarrassing.\""},"399":{"dur":3,"text":"And then I'm encouraged to message my friend,"},"402":{"dur":1,"text":"but here's the critical difference."},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm provided specific suggested language"},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"that helps me communicate to Laura"},"410":{"dur":1,"text":"how the photo makes me feel."},"412":{"dur":3,"text":"Now the team found that this relatively small change"},"415":{"dur":1,"text":"had a huge impact."},"417":{"dur":2,"text":"Before, only 20 percent of people"},"419":{"dur":1,"text":"were sending the message,"},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"and now 60 percent were,"},"422":{"dur":1,"text":"and surveys showed that people"},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"on both sides of the conversation"},"426":{"dur":1,"text":"felt better as a result."},"428":{"dur":1,"text":"That same survey showed"},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"that 90 percent of your friends"},"432":{"dur":2,"text":"want to know if they've done something to upset you."},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"Now I don't know who the other 10 percent are,"},"436":{"dur":1,"text":"but maybe that's where our \"Unfriend\" feature"},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"can come in handy."},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"So as you can see,"},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"these decisions are highly nuanced."},"444":{"dur":1,"text":"Of course we use a lot of data"},"446":{"dur":1,"text":"to inform our decisions,"},"447":{"dur":3,"text":"but we also rely very heavily on iteration,"},"451":{"dur":4,"text":"research, testing, intuition, human empathy."},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"It's both art and science."},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, sometimes the designers\nwho work on these products"},"459":{"dur":1,"text":"are called \"data-driven,\""},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"which is a term that totally drives us bonkers."},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"The fact is, it would be irresponsible of us"},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"not to rigorously test our designs"},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"when so many people are counting on us"},"471":{"dur":1,"text":"to get it right,"},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"but data analytics"},"475":{"dur":3,"text":"will never be a substitute for design intuition."},"478":{"dur":3,"text":"Data can help you make a good design great,"},"481":{"dur":3,"text":"but it will never made a bad design good."},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"The next thing that you need\nto understand as a principle"},"488":{"dur":1,"text":"is that when you introduce change,"},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"you need to do it extraordinarily carefully."},"492":{"dur":1,"text":"Now I often have joked that"},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"I spend almost as much time"},"496":{"dur":1,"text":"designing the introduction of change"},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"as I do the change itself,"},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'm sure that we can all relate to that"},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"when something that we use a lot changes"},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"and then we have to adjust."},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"The fact is, people can become"},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"very efficient at using bad design,"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"and so even if the change is\ngood for them in the long run,"},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"it's still incredibly frustrating when it happens,"},"517":{"dur":1,"text":"and this is particularly true"},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"with user-generated content platforms,"},"522":{"dur":3,"text":"because people can rightfully\nclaim a sense of ownership."},"525":{"dur":3,"text":"It is, after all, their content."},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, years ago, when I was working at YouTube,"},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"we were looking for ways to"},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"encourage more people to rate videos,"},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"and it was interesting because\nwhen we looked into the data,"},"538":{"dur":3,"text":"we found that almost everyone was exclusively using"},"542":{"dur":1,"text":"the highest five-star rating,"},"544":{"dur":1,"text":"a handful of people were using"},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"the lowest one-star,"},"547":{"dur":1,"text":"and virtually no one"},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"was using two, three or four stars."},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"So we decided to simplify"},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"into an up-down kind of voting binary model."},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"It's going to be much easier\nfor people to engage with."},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"But people were very attached"},"562":{"dur":1,"text":"to the five-star rating system."},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"Video creators really loved their ratings."},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"Millions and millions of people"},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"were accustomed to the old design."},"569":{"dur":1,"text":"So in order to help people"},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"prepare themselves for change"},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"and acclimate to the new design more quickly,"},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"we actually published the data graph"},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"sharing with the community"},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"the rationale for what we were going to do,"},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"and it even engaged the larger industry"},"584":{"dur":1,"text":"in a conversation, which resulted in"},"586":{"dur":3,"text":"my favorite TechCrunch headline of all time:"},"589":{"dur":3,"text":"\"YouTube Comes to a 5-Star Realization:"},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"Its Ratings Are

something"},"645":{"dur":1,"text":"much more fundamental."},"646":{"dur":4,"text":"You have to understand who you are designing for."},"651":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, when you set a goal to
