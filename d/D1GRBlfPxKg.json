down,"},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"and so a lot of times on my feet,"},"366":{"dur":3,"text":"and I talked a great\nlength about dyslexia."},"370":{"dur":4,"text":"And first of all, just\nthe basic name

a mobile phone box at the school"},"597":{"dur":1,"text":"with a fix line telephone,"},"599":{"dur":1,"text":"and if you wanted to make a call,"},"601":{"dur":4,"text":"you had to keep putting\nmoney into the phone box,"},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"and, if I chose the times of day"},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"where other kids were\nnot using the phone box,"},"610":{"dur":3,"text":"to go and ring up

I lost the money and\nlike didn't get through,"},"623":{"dur":1,"text":"and I rang up the operator,"},"624":{"dur":4,"text":"and they said, \"oh don't\nworry, we'll put you through.\""},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"So then I started using the\noperator as my secretary."},"631":{"dur":1,"text":"I'd just ring up, say I've lost the money,"},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"never put any money in.\n(Chase laughs)"},"634":{"dur":4,"text":"And so I had these posh\noperators being put through,"},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"\"I've got Mr. Branson for you.\""},"640":{"dur":4,"text":"So I

15."},"678":{"dur":1,"text":"- From Huge brands."},"679":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah from big brands, yeah.\n- All of them."},"681":{"dur":3,"text":"- I think, you know, there\nwas this young, enthusiastic,"},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"but actually they wanted\nto get to young people,"},"685":{"dur":2,"text":"so there wasn't a magazine for\nyoung people in those days,"},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"so, somehow we persuaded them."},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"And then the headmaster\nhad me in and said,"},"693":{"dur":0,"text":"\"look,"},"695":{"dur":3,"text":"\"you either run this\nmagazine and leave school,"},"698":{"dur":3,"text":"\"or you stay at school and\nyou don't run the magazine.\""},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"I went, thank you. (laughs)"},"704":{"dur":3,"text":"And I sort of waived him goodbye."},"707":{"dur":3,"text":"And the magazine became my education,"},"711":{"dur":3,"text":"and I suppose I became an\nentrepreneur by

manufacturing,"},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"and being an editor was important,"},"727":{"dur":0,"text":"but"},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"it was at least 50% of the time"},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"was becoming an entrepreneur."},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"A word that didn't exist 50 years ago."},"737":{"dur":1,"text":"Becoming by mistake."},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"- Some French dictionary\nprobably had it in

in Britain\nwas run by government ready."},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"So you had British Telecom, British Gas,"},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"British Steel, British Coal,"},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"and they were awful,"},"756":{"dur":0,"text":"badly run."},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"And then"},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"myself and women called Anita Roddick"},"766":{"dur":1,"text":"who started Body

Anita,"},"774":{"dur":1,"text":"if they wanted to interview\na man, they interviewed me,"},"776":{"dur":3,"text":"so we got more than our\nfair share of publicity"},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"for what we were doing."},"781":{"dur":1,"text":"And the fact that I was young"},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"gave me an added advantage, too."},"788":{"dur":3,"text":"And then just one thing led on to another."},"791":{"dur":2,"text":"I found that music was\nreally expensive to buy"},"794":{"dur":1,"text":"so"},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"I thought, screw that, let's,"},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"we'll use the magazine\nto start selling music"},"800":{"dur":2,"text":"much more cheaply than anybody else."},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"Of course we were selling music we liked"},"805":{"dur":4,"text":"so it didn't have, we wouldn't\nhave had Andy Williams,"},"809":{"dur":1,"text":"it would be Frank Zappa,\nit would be, you know,"},"810":{"dur":2,"text":"we'd start having a credit,\nwe got a lot of credibility"},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"by the quality of the music we sold."},"815":{"dur":3,"text":"- The Stones, Sex Pistols.\n- The Stones, exactly."},"819":{"dur":3,"text":"And then we started, I came across tapes"},"823":{"dur":2,"text":"of artists that we loved\nand nobody would put out."},"825":{"dur":3,"text":"So we thought, screw that,\nwe'll start a record

there"},"853":{"dur":0,"text":"that I wanna hold onto."},"854":{"dur":3,"text":"One was that the magazine\nwas your education."},"858":{"dur":3,"text":"So, what do you have to say\nabout traditional education,"},"861":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, frankly, CreativeLive exists"},"864":{"dur":2,"text":"because I don't feel like\nthat the traditional education"},"867":{"dur":1,"text":"is preparing people for the future"},"868":{"dur":1,"text":"and future skill based and what not,"},"870":{"dur":1,"text":"and obviously you're an\ninvestor in CreativeLive,"},"872":{"dur":1,"text":"so there's an overlap there,"},"874":{"dur":1,"text":"but talk to me about how you think"},"876":{"dur":4,"text":"about traditional education\nversus just the doing."},"887":{"dur":2,"text":"- One of the reasons\nwe started the magazine"},"889":{"dur":0,"text":"was because"},"891":{"dur":4,"text":"I couldn't stand the\neducation system at school."},"896":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, people left

years\nand years of learning Latin"},"906":{"dur":3,"text":"and hardly spoke a word of it."},"909":{"dur":2,"text":"It was just facts being crammed into you."},"912":{"dur":1,"text":"And one of the
