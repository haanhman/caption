around them"},"397":{"dur":1,"text":"at any one time."},"399":{"dur":3,"text":"When you think about all of the\nbits of information in a room,"},"402":{"dur":4,"text":"if you really focused on\nevery

to think of it."},"438":{"dur":3,"text":"We think of ourselves\nas being objective."},"441":{"dur":1,"text":"But the reality that\nwe're experiencing"},"443":{"dur":3,"text":"is not the same as\neveryone else around us,"},"447":{"dur":4,"text":"because their filters are\noperating differently to yours."},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"And then the question is,\nwell, what determines what"},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"you filter in and filter out?"},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is where the\nbig opportunity lies,"},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"because it's quite predictable\nwhat we tend

top-of-mind\ngoing into a day,"},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"going into a meeting,\ngoing into a task."},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"Because if we fall out\nof bed on the wrong side"},"562":{"dur":4,"text":"and

confounds"},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"the world is a terrible place."},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"So you'll spot the guy being\na jerk, the guy letting"},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"the door slam in your

way on the subway."},"585":{"dur":3,"text":"And we can turn\nthat around and say,"},"588":{"dur":4,"text":"how about I decide to set\nmy aims and my attitude"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"and my assumptions in a\nmore positive direction?"},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"And that will determine\nwhere I put my attention."},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's a little routine\nI call setting

aim?"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"Check in with your attitude\nand your assumptions."},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"What does that mean you really\nwant to pay attention to?"},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"And I've not had a\nmeeting quite like the one"},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"I had with Lucas ever since."},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"Because even if the\nmeeting is going badly,"},"625":{"dur":3,"text":"I can take a

be\nto say, OK, I need"},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"to learn from this experience."},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I experience\nthe rest of the meeting"},"638":{"dur":1,"text":"in a different way."},"640":{"dur":1,"text":"And I've even got\nan emergency version"},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"of this, which is when\nI'm grumpy of a morning"},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"and I'm walking along\nand I say, OK, I'm"},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"going to decide to notice three\ngood things in the next five"},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"minutes."},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"The power of that is\nthat you notice things"},"653":{"dur":1,"text":"you wouldn't have noticed."},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"Plus, then, because you've\ngot good things top-of-mind,"},"657":{"dur":1,"text":"you notice more."},"659":{"dur":4,"text":"And that changes the\ntrajectory of the day."},"663":{"dur":1,"text":"So we can shape reality."},"665":{"dur":3,"text":"We can shape the reality\nthat we experience"},"668":{"dur":4,"text":"really quite deeply and quite\npowerfully and quite easily."},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's the first thing that\nbehavioral science teaches us"},"675":{"dur":3,"text":"that we have more control\nover than we think."},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"Let me talk now about time."},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"Who here would like\nmore hours in a

away"},"1313":{"dur":3,"text":"from the more sophisticated\npart of your brain."},"1317":{"dur":1,"text":"That means you can\nsee on a brain scan"},"1319":{"dur":2,"text":"that when people are\neven

could actually take."},"1359":{"dur":1,"text":"It boosted my sense\nof competence."},"1360":{"dur":3,"text":"Bam, I'm out of defensive\nmode and thinking"},"1363":{"dur":2,"text":"more clearly and creatively."},"1366":{"dur":2,"text":"And you see this\ntime and time again"},"1368":{"dur":2,"text":"in meetings where people\nare getting bogged down"},"1370":{"dur":2,"text":"to ask a question

be"},"1380":{"dur":3,"text":"or to say, when have we solved\na problem like this before?"},"1384":{"dur":3,"text":"And what can we learn from that?"},"1387":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a way of giving
