get the income that"},"3839":{"dur":2,"text":"they need whereas they\ncan get off the street."},"3841":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that's what we do in\nthe National Association

they"},"3883":{"dur":2,"text":"got disgruntled that\nthey don't go anymore."},"3885":{"dur":2,"text":"So what we do is sit down and\ntalk with those veterans and"},"3888":{"dur":3,"text":"encourage

a"},"3915":{"dur":3,"text":"desire to get off the street\nbecause they don't know how."},"3919":{"dur":4,"text":"And so what we do, first off, is\nto try to help them
