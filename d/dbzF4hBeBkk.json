we wanted-- this might\nsound a bit paradoxical,"},"40":{"dur":2,"text":"but we wanted to make\nit a simple module."},"42":{"dur":3,"text":"Because it's likely to be\nsandwiched for many

which"},"59":{"dur":2,"text":"gives people the opportunity\nto pursue their own interests"},"62":{"dur":1,"text":"to a great extent."},"64":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's got five blocks,\nit's got five

hours."},"73":{"dur":2,"text":"And we'll give you lots\nof preparation time."},"75":{"dur":2,"text":"And we wanted to have an exam\nbecause we felt it gave people"},"78":{"dur":3,"text":"the

now,"},"222":{"dur":2,"text":"it will be centred online."},"225":{"dur":4,"text":"And we used the online\nenvironment obviously"},"229":{"dur":3,"text":"for reinforcement activities for\nall those kind of basic things"},"232":{"dur":2,"text":"that you need for the\nkind of calendar which"},"235":{"dur":2,"text":"moves you through week by week."},"237":{"dur":3,"text":"But we've also used it as the--"},"240":{"dur":3,"text":"what, the base on which\nwe've put lots of interviews"},"244":{"dur":7,"text":"Because we wanted to show how\npeople's personal interests"},"252":{"dur":4,"text":"and identities cross over\ninto their academic work."},"256":{"dur":1,"text":"So we could begin,\nfor example, by asking"},"258":{"dur":3,"text":"a lot of our academic\ncontributors, what's"},"261":{"dur":1,"text":"your personal interest\nin what you do?"},"263":{"dur":1,"text":"Why did you start doing it?"},"265":{"dur":3,"text":"And then coming from\nthat, how does it go out"},"268":{"dur":3,"text":"and impact on the larger world?"},"271":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's probably the\noverview of the materials."},"275":{"dur":3,"text":"Audiovisual material on\nthe online environment,"},"278":{"dur":1,"text":"the textbooks."},"279":{"dur":4,"text":"We've given quite a lot of\nlinks outward to other material."},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"And we give people quite\nof

the changes in the world"},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"require that social\npsychology itself changes."},"334":{"dur":3,"text":"So we're looking at that\ndynamic interplay all the way."},"338":{"dur":4,"text":"And some of the contemporary\nissues that we focus on,"},"342":{"dur":4,"text":"they include the kind of--"},"347":{"dur":1,"text":"well, the state of\nthe nation, really."},"349":{"dur":4,"text":"We talk about neoliberalism,\nwe talk about globalisation,"},"353":{"dur":5,"text":"we talk about immigration, we\ntalk about multiculturalism."},"358":{"dur":4,"text":"We talk about the\nidentities of people today."},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"So we talk about gender,\nchanging meanings"},"365":{"dur":3,"text":"of gender, new femininities,\nnew masculinities."},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"We talk about conflict\nbecause unfortunately, it's"},"371":{"dur":1,"text":"very difficult to\ntalk about the world"},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"today without talking\nabout conflict."},"375":{"dur":5,"text":"And we talk about an area\nwhich might seem less social,"},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"which is the kind of area\nof positive psychology."},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"And Paul will talk\nabout that in a moment."},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"But that's a very good\nexample of this interplay"},"388":{"dur":3,"text":"between psychology, social\npsychology as disciplines,"},"392":{"dur":4,"text":"and the world which they\nkind of appear to start from,"},"397":{"dur":4,"text":"but in fact, in a funny\nfeedback way, act on as well."},"401":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Excellent."},"402":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you very much, Sophie."},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"That's a really brief outline\nabout the module, the blocks,"},"406":{"dur":1,"text":"and some of the key themes."},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"And I wonder if we could\npick up on some of that."},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"Because as usual, these sessions\nnever have quite as much time"},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"as I would like to talk\nabout some of these issues."},"415":{"dur":4,"text":"David, I wonder if you can tell\nus about your area of interest,"},"419":{"dur":1,"text":"and just sort of\ngive us an example."},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"You wanted to talk a bit\nabout violence and conflict."},"423":{"dur":0,"text":"DAVID KAPOSI: Yes."},"424":{"dur":3,"text":"So Steph mentioned that conflict\nis an important social issue"},"427":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, funnily enough, around\ntwo and a half decades ago"},"432":{"dur":3,"text":"with the collapse of communism\nfall of the Berlin Wall,"},"435":{"dur":1,"text":"there was an idea\nthat actually there's"},"437":{"dur":3,"text":"not going to be much\nconflict in the future."},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"There is this prevailing\nliberal order,"},"443":{"dur":4,"text":"and we people in the world will,\nat some point in the future--"},"447":{"dur":4,"text":"near future,\nperhaps, negotiate in"},"452":{"dur":3,"text":"a reasonable, rational manner\nwhatever differences they have."},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"Now looking back, it sounds,\nof course, very naive."},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"Because it is quite clear after\nthese two and a half decades"},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"that conflict is here to stay."},"464":{"dur":3,"text":"There are interactible\ninternational conflicts,"},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"like the\nIsraeli-Palestinian issue,"},"469":{"dur":3,"text":"which is one we pick up\nin the book, actually."},"473":{"dur":3,"text":"There are reemerging\nconflicts, say the one"},"476":{"dur":1,"text":"between Russia and Ukraine."},"477":{"dur":3,"text":"And there are conflicts which\nI don't think anyone really"},"480":{"dur":4,"text":"foresaw, which is Brexit."},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"But also, the emergence of\nthe far right, Donald Trump,"},"487":{"dur":0,"text":"these kind of issues."},"488":{"dur":3,"text":"Now why does conflict\nseem to be so persistent?"},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"And violent conflict\nin particular?"},"495":{"dur":4,"text":"There can be many\nexplanations to this question."},"500":{"dur":3,"text":"But one way to think\nabout it, which"},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"comes from the tradition\nof psychology, which"},"505":{"dur":4,"text":"is my personal interest,\nis to think of people"},"510":{"dur":6,"text":"as essentially conflicted from\ninside, conflicted beings."},"516":{"dur":3,"text":"So rather than being surprised\nthat conflict is with us,"},"519":{"dur":4,"text":"to start thinking of it in\nterms of how we are conflicted"},"524":{"dur":6,"text":"inside, and how we deal with\nall these internal conflicts."},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"And to think about\nsociety or conflict"},"533":{"dur":1,"text":"with reference-- not\nexquisite reference,"},"535":{"dur":6,"text":"but partly with reference to\nindividual personal conflicts."},"542":{"dur":4,"text":"This would be some sort\nof psychoanalytic approach"},"547":{"dur":1,"text":"to social psychology."},"548":{"dur":5,"text":"And this will form one\nblock in this module--"},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"the final, the fifth book where\nwe think about these issues"},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"from a psychoanalytic\npoint of view."},"558":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Excellent."},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"So dealing with some\nquite big issues there."},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"Paul, you've written chapter\n12 of the book, which"},"565":{"dur":3,"text":"is called Happy Subjects and\nHumaneering, A Contemporary"},"568":{"dur":1,"text":"Subject."},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's an interesting title."},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"PAUL STENNER: Yes,\nwell the block title"},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"is A Contemporary Subject."},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"And we were interested\nin this idea"},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"that the way in\nwhich people are,"},"581":{"dur":3,"text":"our experiences, our\npsychologies are not universal."},"585":{"dur":3,"text":"They change from historical\nmoment to historical moment."},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, this idea, the\ntitle A Contemporary Subject"},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"has got a dual meaning."},"593":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll talk about the second\nmeaning in a minute,"},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"but the first meaning of\na contemporary subject"},"598":{"dur":4,"text":"is just that the topic\nof happiness, which"},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"I focus on in this chapter, is\nof the now, it's of the moment."},"605":{"dur":3,"text":"It's something\nthat's contemporary."},"609":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's contemporary\nin a couple of senses."},"614":{"dur":3,"text":"You might say that people\nhave forever been interested"},"617":{"dur":1,"text":"in their own happiness."},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'm sure that's\nprobably true."},"621":{"dur":1,"text":"There's a sense of which\nit's some-- there's"},"623":{"dur":1,"text":"something timeless about it."},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"But there's two\nrecent developments"},"626":{"dur":1,"text":"that make it contemporary."},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"One is a development of a\nnew approach to psychology,"},"630":{"dur":3,"text":"a new school of psychology\nover the last 10 or 15 years"},"634":{"dur":3,"text":"that Steph briefly mentioned,\nwhich is positive psychology."},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"And positive psychology sort\nof tells the story of itself"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"as being a radical departure\nfrom previous types"},"642":{"dur":0,"text":"of psychology."},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"So it points out that in\nits classic incarnation,"},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"psychology always\nfocuses on the negative."},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"It's about delinquency,\nit's about a deviance,"},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"it's about psychopathology, it's\nabout children who wet the bed"},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"It's about negative things."},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"So have a problem,\ncall in a psychologist."},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"And positive psychologists\ntake the view"},"663":{"dur":3,"text":"that it's much better to focus\non the positive aspects of what"},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"they call human flourishing."},"669":{"dur":4,"text":"So they've put happinesses right\nof the centre of the agenda"},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"of psychology."},"677":{"dur":3,"text":"And at the same time, and during\nthe same period, governments,"},"680":{"dur":1,"text":"corporations\nthroughout the world"},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"have become interested\nin happiness,"},"684":{"dur":3,"text":"in collecting data about the\nhappiness of their populations,"},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"or the happiness of\ntheir work force,"},"690":{"dur":3,"text":"and using that data to make\ndecisions about their policies,"},"693":{"dur":1,"text":"or about their strategies."},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"So happiness has\nbecome part of the way"},"697":{"dur":3,"text":"in which we're governed today."},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"And this goes hand-in-hand\nwith the development"},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"of this approach to psychology."},"704":{"dur":6,"text":"So we find that an\ninteresting thing to focus on."},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"And the-"},"713":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: The\nother area you talk"},"714":{"dur":1,"text":"about is human subjectivity."},"716":{"dur":1,"text":"PAUL STENNER: Yes."},"717":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: So this\nis an interesting idea."},"719":{"dur":0,"text":"PAUL STENNER: Yes."},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"This is, I suppose,\nthe second meaning"},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"of a contemporary subject."},"723":{"dur":3,"text":"This idea that we explore\nin the module, which"},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"is, I think, a very exciting\nidea, that human subjectivity--"},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"by which we mean\nour own experiences"},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"of ourselves from our\nfirst person perspective,"},"734":{"dur":4,"text":"our thoughts, our feelings,\nour internal life,"},"738":{"dur":2,"text":"that our subjectivity\nis something"},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"that changes in different\nhistorical moments,"},"743":{"dur":1,"text":"in different social settings."},"744":{"dur":1,"text":"It's as if we're--"},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"we used to think of\nhuman beings as complete,"},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"and you would describe them\nobjectively as psychologists."},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"Whereas now, we start to\nthink of the human being"},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"as sort of incomplete,\nand completed"},"755":{"dur":3,"text":"by the social context,\nto some extent."},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"And what's also interesting,\nand what we explore,"},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"is the idea that\npsychology as a discipline"},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"doesn't just describe\nwhat people are,"},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"it also provides\nways of thinking"},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"about what we might become."},"771":{"dur":4,"text":"It influences the way in which\nwe act, the way in which we"},"776":{"dur":0,"text":"think about ourselves."},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: So is this what\nyou mean by-- you mentioned"},"780":{"dur":1,"text":"the word humaneering earlier."},"781":{"dur":1,"text":"PAUL STENNER: Yeah,\nhuman-- it's a strange--"},"782":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Is this a\nterm you've invented?"},"784":{"dur":1,"text":"PAUL STENNER: We didn't coin it."},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"It comes actually from a\nsocial psychology textbook,"},"789":{"dur":1,"text":"mid-twentieth century\nfrom the States."},"791":{"dur":2,"text":"But the word grabbed\nme and my colleagues"},"793":{"dur":1,"text":"so much that we decided\nwe would use it."},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"Because it's a pun, of\ncourse, on engineering."},"797":{"dur":1,"text":"And just as in the\nphysical sciences"},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"you would get knowledge\nabout the physical world"},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"that you would then\napply via engineering,"},"803":{"dur":2,"text":"the idea of social\npsychology conventionally,"},"806":{"dur":3,"text":"traditionally out of itself\nis a humaneering discipline."},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"You come up with objective\nscientific knowledge"},"811":{"dur":2,"text":"in the laboratory,\nand then you apply"},"814":{"dur":4,"text":"that to change people's conduct\nand way of thinking and way"},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"of feeling in order\nto, in some way,"},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"improve or enhance that conduct."},"823":{"dur":1,"text":"But of course, this\nraises some kinds"},"825":{"dur":4,"text":"of ethical issues\nabout who says what it"},"829":{"dur":1,"text":"is that people should be like?"},"830":{"dur":4,"text":"Who gives us the ideal\nthat we're aspiring"},"835":{"dur":3,"text":"to in our humaneering activity?"},"838":{"dur":2,"text":"And in some ways,\nnowadays social psychology"},"841":{"dur":2,"text":"is being used in some ways\nthat are quite problematic."},"843":{"dur":5,"text":"So you might been aware in\nthe recent US elections,"},"849":{"dur":3,"text":"for example, but also in the\nreferendum around Brexit."},"853":{"dur":1,"text":"A lot of social\npsychology knowledge"},"854":{"dur":3,"text":"was used to influence the\nway in which people voted."},"857":{"dur":4,"text":"Quite explicitly designed to\nmanipulate people's voting"},"862":{"dur":0,"text":"habits."},"863":{"dur":3,"text":"And this used data, for\nexample, gathered from Facebook,"},"867":{"dur":3,"text":"using the fact that lots

kinds of things\npeople like, for example."},"878":{"dur":5,"text":"And in this way, social\npsychological knowledge"},"883":{"dur":3,"text":"was used, in a\nvery tailored way,"},"886":{"dur":2,"text":"to influence people who were\nperceived to be on the cusp,"},"888":{"dur":2,"text":"not quite knowing exactly\nwhat they were going to vote."},"891":{"dur":3,"text":"And a lot of this was sponsored\nby one side rather than"},"894":{"dur":0,"text":"the other."},"895":{"dur":3,"text":"So this, I think, illustrates\nthat, some of the

that\nthis does actually"},"957":{"dur":3,"text":"indicate a couple of the\nbig topics of the module."},"961":{"dur":3,"text":"One is identity, and the other\nis this idea, as you
