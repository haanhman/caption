just five or ten minutes\non kind of what I am supposed to be doing"},"115":{"dur":5,"text":"if you like, which his around science and\ndata visualisation and then I'll present areas"},"120":{"dur":5,"text":"that I've been working in the humanities at\nUWA and then mostly around data capture, image"},"126":{"dur":5,"text":"capture, novel ways of doing that."},"131":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not particularly new."},"132":{"dur":3,"text":"People have been applying this, these techniques\nalready."},"136":{"dur":4,"text":"I guess what I'll be presenting here is the\nfact that we've got local expertise in iVEC"},"141":{"dur":8,"text":"on how to do this and they are projects that\nare sort of relevant to the social scene."},"149":{"dur":4,"text":"So, the one slide introduction to iVEC."},"154":{"dur":7,"text":"It's a partnership between five organisations,\nthe five research organisations and, of course,"},"161":{"dur":3,"text":"Curtin is one of those."},"165":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's basically about, this is my definitions."},"169":{"dur":2,"text":"You might get different ones depending on\nwho you talk to."},"171":{"dur":6,"text":"But for me it's about this facilitating advance\ncomputing across the pattern of organisations."},"178":{"dur":5,"text":"And that includes both hardware, so iVEC is\nmanaging super computing facilities, also"},"183":{"dur":4,"text":"managing visualisation and data storage, but\nit's also equally about the expertise in the"},"188":{"dur":2,"text":"organisation."},"190":{"dur":5,"text":"And there are these five programs and some\nof you may know Valerie who is the education"},"196":{"dur":1,"text":"program leader."},"197":{"dur":3,"text":"So, if you want to know about that you can\ntalk to her later on."},"200":{"dur":7,"text":"There's an e-Research program headed up by\nValerie also by Ginny Harrison at UWA."},"208":{"dur":5,"text":"There's an Industry in Government Uptake by\nAndrew Beveridge, Super Grouping in Technologies,"},"213":{"dur":7,"text":"which is by George Beckett and there's a Visualization\nTeam of three at the moment."},"220":{"dur":4,"text":"So, this is my definition and like I say visualization\nis a pretty broad thing."},"225":{"dur":6,"text":"But in the science data visualization is really\nabout insight, providing insight to researchers"},"232":{"dur":2,"text":"or to the public."},"234":{"dur":5,"text":"And it's using advanced computing, often advanced\ncomputer graphics to achieve that."},"239":{"dur":5,"text":"And, of course, my mother has trouble telling\nher friends what I do because even I'm confused"},"244":{"dur":1,"text":"sometimes."},"245":{"dur":7,"text":"So, this is sort of the definition I tell\nmy mother so she can explain what I do."},"253":{"dur":4,"text":"It's kind of an exciting area to be involved\nin because it requires, or often requires"},"257":{"dur":2,"text":"quite a range of expertise."},"259":{"dur":5,"text":"So, obviously there's a lot of computer graphics\ninvolved, computer programming, having a good"},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"foundation in mathematics is pretty useful."},"267":{"dur":4,"text":"But then it goes into more creative things\nas well."},"272":{"dur":6,"text":"So, perception theory and computer interface,\nhuman computer interfaces."},"279":{"dur":6,"text":"So, I'll just go through a couple of previous\nprojects around science visualization just"},"286":{"dur":8,"text":"to set the scene for what I'm often doing\nand then I'll start into these three project"},"294":{"dur":1,"text":"areas."},"296":{"dur":8,"text":"So, this is a visualization of computer simulations\nin the weather area."},"304":{"dur":5,"text":"In this case it's a tornado."},"309":{"dur":4,"text":"And this kind of has a lot of the characteristics\nof what visualization in the sciences is about."},"314":{"dur":6,"text":"It's about this mapping of variables into\ngraphics."},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"And we have a language for doing that."},"323":{"dur":5,"text":"We use colour, hot is, red is hot and blue\nis cold, some sort of scale there."},"328":{"dur":3,"text":"We have vectors to show directions, in this\ncase wind directions."},"332":{"dur":3,"text":"And we introduce you know balls that bubble\naround to introduce, and I actually don't"},"335":{"dur":1,"text":"know what that is representing."},"337":{"dur":2,"text":"I can't remember what that's about."},"339":{"dur":8,"text":"But this is language of how you convert variables\nin your simulation to graphical representations."},"348":{"dur":6,"text":"During this talk you'll probably see a few\nexamples of these round images that might"},"354":{"dur":3,"text":"seem a bit strange to you."},"357":{"dur":8,"text":"That's because these are used often to project\ninto hemispherical dome environments."},"366":{"dur":4,"text":"So if you see circular things we don't only\ngenerate there, we generate stuff with flat"},"370":{"dur":1,"text":"screens as well."},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"A lot of the examples I'm showing will be\nfrom the iDomes."},"374":{"dur":5,"text":"So, another example is a very common dataset\nin sciences and this actually called volumetric"},"380":{"dur":1,"text":"datasets."},"381":{"dur":8,"text":"And you give this from a whole range of 3-D\nscanners, whether MRI, CT, Micro CT, Synchrotron."},"389":{"dur":6,"text":"And this is an example of data where you have\na volume of space and within that volume you"},"395":{"dur":1,"text":"know something at every point."},"397":{"dur":4,"text":"So, in this case it's a CT scan so what you\nknow about is density."},"402":{"dur":4,"text":"In other cases there's water volume."},"406":{"dur":8,"text":"And so what visualization is about in this\ncase is revealing the interior of these often"},"414":{"dur":4,"text":"solid objects where they're fossils or in\nthis case a mummy, which has never been opened."},"419":{"dur":7,"text":"So, this is currently residing at Mona and\nHobart and it's a public exhibit, but this"},"426":{"dur":4,"text":"was part of the research phase for looking\nat this-- for looking at the interior of this"},"430":{"dur":8,"text":"mummy, looking at how she died and whether\nthere is jewelry and all this sort of stuff,"},"438":{"dur":3,"text":"so this sort of forensic stuff that goes on\nthere."},"442":{"dur":6,"text":"And then this next example, which I think\nis the last one is volumetric data but it's"},"448":{"dur":1,"text":"not a scan."},"449":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not a recording of volume."},"451":{"dur":7,"text":"It is a-- it's a computer simulation in this\ncase of galaxy formation form astrophysicists"},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"at ICRA."},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"And again it's this mapping between what's\nhappening in the simulation."},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"In this case there are three things."},"465":{"dur":3,"text":"There's stars, which are the whitish stuff."},"469":{"dur":5,"text":"There's H1 gas, which is red and then there's\ndark matter, which is the bluey stuff."},"474":{"dur":6,"text":"And so this sort of highlights another characteristic\nof a lot of these datasets and this is a huge"},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"amount of data here."},"483":{"dur":4,"text":"Every time step is about 36 gigabytes and\nthey ran this basically from the big bang"},"488":{"dur":3,"text":"until present day not saving every time step\nof course."},"491":{"dur":6,"text":"But, so I've got a characteristic of what\nhappens in the sciences is all this big data"},"498":{"dur":5,"text":"thing where you have an awful lot of data\nthat goes into generating these things, datasets."},"503":{"dur":5,"text":"But in this case, the same machine that generated\nthe datasets is used to do the visualization"},"508":{"dur":6,"text":"just because that was the only place where\nthere was sufficient resources to do that."},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"So, visualization has got that word visual\nin it."},"518":{"dur":5,"text":"So, you might imagine that most of the time\nwhat we're doing is using the human sense"},"523":{"dur":4,"text":"of vision to convey this information to your\nbrain."},"528":{"dur":6,"text":"And so you might imagine that what we should\nbe doing is sort of leveraging what our visual"},"535":{"dur":7,"text":"system can do and so if you're sitting in\nyour office there are these three things that"},"542":{"dur":5,"text":"your desktop display, unless you've got a\nreally special one, doesn't do."},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's fairly obvious when you think about\nthem; the first is stereopsis, so we have"},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"two eyes."},"552":{"dur":1,"text":"They're offset."},"553":{"dur":1,"text":"We get the sense of depth."},"554":{"dur":3,"text":"It's not hard for you to imagine that if you've\ngot a complicated bit of geometry that you're"},"557":{"dur":4,"text":"trying to understand or a complicated process\nthat having that sense of depth would be a"},"562":{"dur":7,"text":"valuable thing to aid in your understanding\nof what's going on."},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"We also have a very wide field of view."},"572":{"dur":4,"text":"So, if you're sitting in your office you might\nbe using 30 to 40 degrees of your available"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"field of view and the rest is just your office."},"579":{"dur":3,"text":"Whereas, if you look straight ahead and put\nyour hands out here, you can still see your"},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"hands."},"584":{"dur":3,"text":"So, we've got an almost 180 field of view."},"587":{"dur":3,"text":"And so again, you might imagine that there\nare times when you were immersed if you are"},"590":{"dur":6,"text":"inside your dataset with your entire field\nall filled up, that might be a useful thing"},"596":{"dur":1,"text":"to do."},"598":{"dur":3,"text":"And then last thing is visual fidelity, granted\nif you've got a retina display and you're"},"602":{"dur":5,"text":"sitting up close you're getting pretty close\nto what your visual system can resolve, but"},"607":{"dur":3,"text":"if you've got a large one to one display generally\nthe resolution is much less than what you've"},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"got in sort of what your eye can do in the\nreal world."},"612":{"dur":3,"text":"The resolution of that is much less than what\nyou've got in a sort of a what your eye can"},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"do in the real world."},"618":{"dur":5,"text":"And so what I'm coming around to saying is\nthat visualization is often about employing"},"624":{"dur":6,"text":"displays that make use of those characteristics\nof that visual system."},"630":{"dur":3,"text":"One way of doing that is through tile displays."},"634":{"dur":3,"text":"That's how you get a very large pixel count,\na very large resolution."},"637":{"dur":3,"text":"You stand back to sort of zoom out."},"641":{"dur":4,"text":"And the peripheral vision is something that's\ndone through something like an iDome but there's"},"645":{"dur":1,"text":"other ways of doing that as well."},"646":{"dur":7,"text":"So, just quickly some of the tools of-- that\nI've provided in this space is around people,"},"654":{"dur":4,"text":"so there are three half-funded positions at\nthe moment."},"658":{"dur":6,"text":"There's budget to support projects at the\npartners and we have various machinery to"},"665":{"dur":6,"text":"assist in that visualization process where\nthey will add value."},"672":{"dur":6,"text":"And there's also various instruments that\nwe have to solve problems in various spaces."},"678":{"dur":3,"text":"So, two plugs for today."},"681":{"dur":4,"text":"The first one is Digital Humanities 2014,\nwhich I was halfway down the road and I forgot"},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"to bring it."},"686":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I had to drive back and get it or I would\nhave been in trouble from the-- by Ginny who's"},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"heading up this conference."},"692":{"dur":4,"text":"There is an international conference happening\nearly next year."},"696":{"dur":5,"text":"And the second plug is to Curtin who've got\na pretty exciting facility coming on line"},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"and some of you may know about this."},"704":{"dur":5,"text":"I mean if you have questions about it Andrew\nWoods is sitting in the audience and can field"},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"any questions you might have."},"711":{"dur":5,"text":"So, this is a pretty exciting space going\nin at the John Curtin, in the John Curtin"},"717":{"dur":1,"text":"Gallery."},"718":{"dur":5,"text":"And it's going to have a number of these machines\nwhich facilitates this visualization process."},"723":{"dur":7,"text":"I've listed some of them there and it's going\nto have-- it's in a gallery area so it's going"},"731":{"dur":1,"text":"to have two modes of operation."},"732":{"dur":4,"text":"One will be a research mode and the other\nwill be an exhibition type mode."},"736":{"dur":4,"text":"And there are these various targeted applications\nat the moment."},"740":{"dur":3,"text":"And I don't know if I was supposed to put\nthe November launch date in there and how"},"744":{"dur":5,"text":"solid it is, but that's the plan for a launch\nin November."},"749":{"dur":7,"text":"Okay, so the three projects or the three discipline\nareas, three capabilities that I'm going to"},"756":{"dur":5,"text":"talk about as from the beginning is going\nto be high resolution photography."},"762":{"dur":6,"text":"The second one is around 3-D reconstruction\nof objects from photographs and the last one"},"769":{"dur":5,"text":"is in the cultural heritage space around 360\nvideo and for each of those I'll show a number"},"774":{"dur":1,"text":"of examples."},"775":{"dur":4,"text":"So, starting off with sort of high risk capture\nand the thing that all these have in common,"},"780":{"dur":5,"text":"I guess, or at least I'm pretending that they\nhave in common is that they were developed"},"786":{"dur":4,"text":"to solve problems in other areas in sciences\nor in engineering."},"791":{"dur":6,"text":"And they are increasingly being used in a\nbroader, in a broader sense."},"797":{"dur":6,"text":"So this is about realising that if you want\nto capture something at a higher and higher"},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"resolution, if you want to photograph something\nat a higher and higher resolution, you can't"},"808":{"dur":5,"text":"just go out there and buy an arbitrarily high\nsensor camera and stand sensor."},"813":{"dur":7,"text":"So, we're currently limited and that growth\nis quite slow over the last five years."},"821":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's also quite important to realise that\nhaving an even higher and higher resolution"},"825":{"dur":3,"text":"since it may not get you anything because\nyou may not be able to afford the optics and"},"828":{"dur":1,"text":"the lens that's going to go onto that."},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"So, how does one do this?"},"832":{"dur":1,"text":"It's fairly obvious."},"833":{"dur":5,"text":"You just take lots of photos so you want to\nphotograph something at a particular resolution."},"839":{"dur":4,"text":"You just scan your photographs, stitch those\ntogether with algorithms that are pretty well"},"843":{"dur":5,"text":"established in computer science and you have\nessentially an arbitrary high res."},"849":{"dur":3,"text":"So, why do you want to do this?"},"852":{"dur":5,"text":"So, in the projects I'm going to show you\nsome of them are around going and capturing"},"858":{"dur":5,"text":"imagery from sights that are hard to get to\nso you can't just arbitrarily drive there"},"863":{"dur":6,"text":"and get out and take, capture your research\ndata if you didn't get it the first time."},"869":{"dur":7,"text":"So, there's access and its kind of-- all of\nthese things are kind of around if you've"},"876":{"dur":2,"text":"got the opportunity to capture something."},"878":{"dur":8,"text":"You better-- you might as well do it and generate\nthese richer resource, research objects then"},"886":{"dur":3,"text":"sort of doing it in sort of simpler ways."},"890":{"dur":7,"text":"So, this has been used for a long time so\nmost of you will know what the Hubble is."},"898":{"dur":3,"text":"And you may have seen the Hubble deep field\nphotography which is pretty amazing because"},"901":{"dur":4,"text":"this particular section here, if you hold\nyour hand out, and have-- imagine what one"},"906":{"dur":6,"text":"millimetre is on the sky, one millimetre square;\nthat's what this image is and there are 10,000"},"912":{"dur":4,"text":"galaxies already and they are limited in how\nfar, how deep they can see."},"916":{"dur":6,"text":"So, it's pretty amazing for all sorts of reasons,\nbut this is a mosaic of whatever you want"},"922":{"dur":10,"text":"to call it, of something in order of 300-350\nimages to form this one image."},"933":{"dur":3,"text":"It's being used fairly regularly in optical\nmicroscopy."},"936":{"dur":3,"text":"Again, this is a four by four, in this case\nit's the opposite to astronomy."},"940":{"dur":2,"text":"It's down at the microscopic scale."},"942":{"dur":4,"text":"And this is an optical microscope that takes\nfour of these in a grid and they stitch that"},"946":{"dur":1,"text":"together."},"948":{"dur":3,"text":"And we're also doing work with geologists."},"952":{"dur":2,"text":"This is again going out to remote areas."},"954":{"dur":3,"text":"This is a 20 meter long strip that they're\ninterested in."},"958":{"dur":4,"text":"You can't get the camera far enough anyway\nto catch the entire thing, but they also want"},"963":{"dur":6,"text":"this across scale resolution or high resolution\nso they can do cross-scale studies and this"},"969":{"dur":3,"text":"is another way of achieving that."},"973":{"dur":7,"text":"So, the first project that we applied this\ntwo was a place called Wanmanna, which is"},"980":{"dur":2,"text":"there."},"982":{"dur":1,"text":"People talk about Perth being the most isolated\ncity."},"984":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, got to Newman sometime and see what\nthat's like."},"988":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a lovely sight."},"989":{"dur":4,"text":"This is kind of what it looks like and there\nare these two rock faces."},"994":{"dur":5,"text":"There's not normally water there, but we were\nthere after some rain and they recorded something"},"1000":{"dur":4,"text":"like 200-250 bits of rock art across there,\nacross that sight."},"1004":{"dur":3,"text":"So, it's kind of interesting."},"1008":{"dur":5,"text":"One of them for me, this was my first trip\nto sort of explore some of these ideas with"},"1013":{"dur":5,"text":"the centre of rock art research at UWA and\nI was kind of surprised that at no point did"},"1019":{"dur":1,"text":"they capture the entire site."},"1021":{"dur":4,"text":"They were only really concentrating on individual\nbits of rock art."},"1025":{"dur":3,"text":"So, this is them clambering across rocks and\nas you can see there are places you can't"},"1029":{"dur":5,"text":"get to and strewn across this is rock art."},"1034":{"dur":4,"text":"So, the technology for doing this I guess\nis the other sort of take home message for"},"1038":{"dur":4,"text":"the three things I'm talking about here is\nyou don't actually need-- the equipment is"},"1043":{"dur":4,"text":"not particularly special and there aren't\nhuge budgets involved in capturing this sort"},"1048":{"dur":1,"text":"of stuff."},"1049":{"dur":1,"text":"So, the technique here is pretty straightforward."},"1050":{"dur":4,"text":"You just have this motorised rig, which is\nthis thing here."},"1055":{"dur":2,"text":"You stick a camera on it, a lens."},"1058":{"dur":6,"text":"You choose a lens and you-- this motorised\nthing just takes all these photographs."},"1064":{"dur":4,"text":"This is actually a really by today's standards,\nthis is actually a pretty coarse image."},"1069":{"dur":2,"text":"It's only 40,000 pixels across."},"1071":{"dur":5,"text":"We're currently doing them up into this sort\nof 400 to 500, yea 400 or 500,000 pixels across."},"1077":{"dur":7,"text":"But this was the first sort of exploration\nof this, this sort of onsite."},"1085":{"dur":4,"text":"And kind of in a simplistic way this is what\nyou're getting, so you've got that this really"},"1089":{"dur":3,"text":"high resolution image and you can zoom in\nand pan across."},"1093":{"dur":5,"text":"And essentially what I'm calling sort of armchair\narcheology where you can explore this site"},"1098":{"dur":6,"text":"when you get back in the comfort of your office\nrather than in 15 degree heat with mosquitoes"},"1105":{"dur":3,"text":"and possibly crocs for all I know."},"1108":{"dur":2,"text":"There weren't any."},"1111":{"dur":4,"text":"And so this kind of highlights what you can\ndo and like I say some of the rock art here"},"1116":{"dur":2,"text":"is not particularly exciting or even recognisable."},"1119":{"dur":5,"text":"This is a person's head with a ring of many\npeople as a headband."},"1124":{"dur":9,"text":"So, this is still zoomed out at I think 25\npercent of full resolution."},"1133":{"dur":7,"text":"So, we did this for each of the rock faces\nand this is how people can explore these sights"},"1141":{"dur":3,"text":"when they get back to their offices."},"1144":{"dur":1,"text":"This is supposed to be a turtle."},"1145":{"dur":5,"text":"I don't quite get it myself."},"1151":{"dur":4,"text":"And of course my favourite bit of rock art\nfrom this place with the two kangaroos mating."},"1155":{"dur":4,"text":"There were some challenges, so this is sort\nof where the computer science and even mathematics"},"1160":{"dur":4,"text":"aspects come in and certainly imaging and\ncomputer graphics, in that if you try to,"},"1165":{"dur":4,"text":"if you capture one of these things you can't\njust save it as a jpeg okay."},"1169":{"dur":7,"text":"Because it turns out until you try jpeg won't\nlet you go more than 32,000 pixels and the"},"1176":{"dur":3,"text":"same thing goes for both PNG and TIFF."},"1179":{"dur":5,"text":"There are solutions to this but the other\nthing you realise is you can't just arbitrarily"},"1185":{"dur":1,"text":"open these things in Photoshop."},"1187":{"dur":5,"text":"Most of the imaging viewing programs expect\nthat the entire image is in memory at once."},"1193":{"dur":6,"text":"And so, if I have a 10 gigabyte image which\nnotionally requires perhaps 30 gigs of ram"},"1200":{"dur":3,"text":"not only don't I have 30 gig of ram, but I\nprobably don't, I don't want to wait all that"},"1203":{"dur":1,"text":"time."},"1204":{"dur":3,"text":"So, there are technologies and I'll just skip\nover this, but there are technologies for"},"1208":{"dur":7,"text":"managing that process where you only get delivered\nthe part of the image that you can see at"},"1216":{"dur":1,"text":"the current time."},"1217":{"dur":3,"text":"And you actually are all familiar with that\nbecause that's how Google Earth works."},"1220":{"dur":2,"text":"In Google Earth you don't have all the textures."},"1223":{"dur":3,"text":"You're just delivered the stuff that you can\nsee at the resolution that you can currently"},"1226":{"dur":1,"text":"perceive."},"1227":{"dur":6,"text":"So, the next project was out of Beacon Island\nso you can see I get around, which is one"},"1234":{"dur":3,"text":"of the fun parts of the job."},"1237":{"dur":5,"text":"So, you probably as some of you, most of you\nmay be Australians and I'm not Australian,"},"1243":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm a New Zealander."},"1244":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I didn't know anything about the Batavia\nwhen I started this, but I do now."},"1248":{"dur":3,"text":"For

going to happen on this island\nis that these are old fisherman huts and they"},"1287":{"dur":2,"text":"haven't been occupied for some time."},"1289":{"dur":3,"text":"And they are generally starting to fall apart."},"1292":{"dur":6,"text":"So, instead of this island, which is now a\nreserve, starting to look interestingly like"},"1298":{"dur":5,"text":"a junk pile they are going to remove the huts."},"1303":{"dur":3,"text":"That's going to happen perhaps toward the\nend of this year."},"1307":{"dur":7,"text":"And the-- sort of the archeology aspect of\nthis is that it's expected that many of the"},"1315":{"dur":3,"text":"graves, or where people were buried are underneath\nthese huts."},"1319":{"dur":5,"text":"The shipwreck was back in the 1600s but the\nreason why the graves are possibly under these"},"1325":{"dur":3,"text":"buildings is that the buildings were built\non stuff that wasn't hard coral that you could"},"1329":{"dur":3,"text":"dig and that's probably where you would dig\ngraves to bury people."},"1332":{"dur":7,"text":"So, the buildings get removed and their team\ngoes back to look for some of the gravesites."},"1340":{"dur":8,"text":"So, my involvement in this has been to record\nor to manage the group that are recording"},"1349":{"dur":5,"text":"how this island is right now, because it's\ngoing to look very different in a year's time."},"1354":{"dur":6,"text":"And so again, that involves this really high\nres photography, so we stick out on one of"},"1361":{"dur":6,"text":"the wharfs or out on the boat and we capture\nin this case, I think this is 200,000 pixels"},"1367":{"dur":6,"text":"across and it allows you to kind of do these\nridiculous zooms in to at least those parts"},"1373":{"dur":3,"text":"that you can see."},"1377":{"dur":1,"text":"And even this I think is one to one."},"1379":{"dur":3,"text":"I think it's still another factor of two on\nthere."},"1382":{"dur":5,"text":"One of the parts of this project is creating\nthis virtual world and an important aspect"},"1388":{"dur":6,"text":"of that, which is reconstructing all the huts,\nputting in all the foliage, is getting good"},"1395":{"dur":4,"text":"textures and so this is going to be the basis\nfor extracting textures because we can take"},"1399":{"dur":5,"text":"one image and that's got information about\nthe texture, building materials across the"},"1404":{"dur":5,"text":"entire range of huts."},"1410":{"dur":6,"text":"So, one of the-- going back to that display\nidea, so one of the users of these high

so it will be a four by three rather"},"1447":{"dur":1,"text":"than a two by three."},"1448":{"dur":5,"text":"So, this allows you to explore these really\nhigh res images without having to continuously"},"1453":{"dur":5,"text":"do this panning and zooming operation that\nyou do normally."},"1458":{"dur":5,"text":"So, very quickly the last piece on this I\nthink is something which I just threw in at"},"1464":{"dur":5,"text":"the last minute because I did it three days\nago and it is applying the same techniques"},"1470":{"dur":5,"text":"to sort of to-- photographs or in this case\nto paintings."},"1475":{"dur":8,"text":"So, this is a dot painting by this artist\nhere and the question was capturing this at"},"1483":{"dur":5,"text":"a higher res both so that we've got a digital\nversion but also to so some sort of forensic"},"1489":{"dur":1,"text":"work on it."},"1490":{"dur":1,"text":"And the setup like I say is pretty trivial."},"1492":{"dur":4,"text":"This is one of the rooms at UWA."},"1497":{"dur":2,"text":"There's nothing particularly you know special\nhere."},"1499":{"dur":3,"text":"It's all standard camera gear, standard

together."},"1510":{"dur":5,"text":"And so the painting itself is about a meter\nwide and then you can zoom in and just see"},"1516":{"dur":2,"text":"this lovely, lovely detail."},"1518":{"dur":4,"text":"And so things that you just did not realise\nwhen you looked at the original painting was"},"1522":{"dur":1,"text":"that it's been overpainted."},"1523":{"dur":4,"text":"So, each of these rings started off having\ntwo colours and now they've overpainted it"},"1528":{"dur":1,"text":"with a white."},"1529":{"dur":4,"text":"And you just can't see that because event\nthis gap here is sort of sub-millimetre in"},"1534":{"dur":1,"text":"real life."},"1535":{"dur":7,"text":"So, the next thing I'm going to be talking\nabout is 3-D reconstruction."},"1542":{"dur":5,"text":"And by that I mean not producing 3-D objects,\nassets by hand which, of course, I've got"},"1548":{"dur":5,"text":"all sorts of interpretation and stuff going\non, but creating them automatically from photographs"},"1553":{"dur":2,"text":"of an object."},"1556":{"dur":1,"text":"And again, it's a new thing."},"1557":{"dur":1,"text":"It's been around for a long time."},"1559":{"dur":7,"text":"In fact, some of these Australian mining industries\nwere actually leading this field some time"},"1566":{"dur":7,"text":"ago and photographing mine pits or mine operations,\ngoing back in a week's time doing it again"},"1574":{"dur":4,"text":"and calculating volume of material extracted."},"1578":{"dur":9,"text":"And again it's got a few sort of nice

inside."},"1593":{"dur":3,"text":"Often you can't take some of the scanning\nmachines to the site."},"1596":{"dur":3,"text":"So, there's a few reasons why we want to do\nthis."},"1600":{"dur":6,"text":"Some of the previous work in this state has\nbeen things like this, which is a-- so this"},"1606":{"dur":6,"text":"is a totally reconstructed form and the whole\nrange of photographs of this pit."},"1613":{"dur":9,"text":"There has been research both at Curtin, ARC,\nServite and UWA doing this sort of work where"},"1622":{"dur":5,"text":"you capture rock face, outcrops being applied\nfor this analysis."},"1628":{"dur":4,"text":"So, the first kind of exploratory work in\nthis case for me was again at Wanmanna, so"},"1632":{"dur":9,"text":"this is one of the rock art sort of rock faces\nat the-- at Wanmanna."},"1642":{"dur":5,"text":"And again, what the archeologists were doing\nthere was a very traditional thing that they"},"1647":{"dur":1,"text":"do."},"1648":{"dur":2,"text":"They go and they photograph these things up\nclose."},"1651":{"dur":1,"text":"They take bearings."},"1652":{"dur":1,"text":"They sketch them."},"1653":{"dur":1,"text":"They annotate."},"1654":{"dur":5,"text":"There's a whole bunch of data that they record\nfor each one of these things."},"1659":{"dur":5,"text":"But the idea here was to capture a much richer,\nso a set of photographs to capture a much"},"1665":{"dur":6,"text":"richer sort of representation of each of these\nbits of rock art, mainly the rock that they're"},"1672":{"dur":2,"text":"on is a three-dimensional object."},"1674":{"dur":2,"text":"In this case, I've shown five images."},"1676":{"dur":4,"text":"I think there are about 10 total that were\ntaken of this structure."},"1681":{"dur":5,"text":"And then this is what you sort of end up with\nis a 3-D, a 3-D model."},"1687":{"dur":7,"text":"So, certainly a much richer sort of research\nasset to have than if you like a whole bunch"},"1694":{"dur":1,"text":"of photographs."},"1696":{"dur":4,"text":"This is a use not necessarily obvious, but\nthis is sort of a 3-dimensional

reconstruct\nthis 3-D model of it."},"1719":{"dur":3,"text":"And in case it's not obvious, this is entirely\nautomatic."},"1722":{"dur":3,"text":"There's no human intervention here except\ntaking the

is actually a little red light bulb,"},"1865":{"dur":2,"text":"so you're looking up at this."},"1867":{"dur":5,"text":"And this kind of gives you that sense of so\nthis is what the 3-D model looks like."},"1873":{"dur":4,"text":"And there's a mesh behind it and then the\nmesh is textured and this is the final result."},"1877":{"dur":7,"text":"So, again a very rich sort of representation\nof the

and their meal was\nrough as a consequence."},"1974":{"dur":4,"text":"But Ngintaka could hear this lovely smooth\ngrinding stone in the distance so he decided"},"1979":{"dur":2,"text":"to go and find this nice grinding stone."},"1982":{"dur":4,"text":"He found it in a neighbouring, took him three\nor four days walking but found this tribe"},"1986":{"dur":2,"text":"that had this lovely grinding

lizard's"},"2056":{"dur":4,"text":"head sticking out of the rock face."},"2061":{"dur":4,"text":"Yes, so an important part of this story is\nthe grinding stone."},"2065":{"dur":5,"text":"So, here is a photograph of the grinding stone,\nan example of a grinding stone."},"2070":{"dur":6,"text":"And so capturing this, so this is leading\nup to a exhibit that's going to be in the"},"2076":{"dur":1,"text":"South Australian museum."},"2078":{"dur":6,"text":"So, part of the interest was to capture 3-D\nassets that they could use in virtual worlds"},"2084":{"dur":1,"text":"for this exhibit."},"2085":{"dur":4,"text":"So, this is a grinding stone and this is a\n3-D reconstruction of it."},"2090":{"dur":7,"text":"But, kind of a better vision is this, because\nalthough some people may see artefacts and"},"2098":{"dur":4,"text":"that's a pretty good representation I reckon\nof a-- of the original thing."},"2102":{"dur":7,"text":"So, there's the original and there's the computer\nreconstruction version with no human intervention."},"2110":{"dur":5,"text":"There's another, there's a couple of other\ncomplicated objects that are part of this"},"2115":{"dur":5,"text":"story and one of them are these headdress\nthings that they wear."},"2121":{"dur":4,"text":"So, this is an example here and they are extremely\ncomplicated."},"2125":{"dur":3,"text":"It has to-- it can't be taken away."},"2128":{"dur":1,"text":"It stays there."},"2129":{"dur":7,"text":"And it would be very hard for a human modeller\nto sort of make a computer version of this"},"2137":{"dur":1,"text":"for the exhibit."},"2138":{"dur":2,"text":"So, this is the result of reconstruction."},"2141":{"dur":1,"text":"Now this is not perfect."},"2142":{"dur":4,"text":"There are a few sort of extraneous things\ngoing on there, but this would be sort of"},"2147":{"dur":6,"text":"the first pass of something which a human\nwill go in and clean up the details of."},"2153":{"dur":2,"text":"This is a full 360 object."},"2156":{"dur":4,"text":"This is thicker in the middle, of course,\nbecause just to hold it, it'll be removed"},"2160":{"dur":5,"text":"from the-- so the last one is around 360 video."},"2165":{"dur":10,"text":"And in the usual, although this technology\nwas originally developed for things like security,"},"2176":{"dur":5,"text":"so you can put one of these cameras in a building\nand then the person on the security desk can"},"2181":{"dur":3,"text":"see everything that's happening at once in\na single camera shot."},"2184":{"dur":7,"text":"Those two examples that I'll talk about will\nbe again recording one of these Ngintaka stories"},"2191":{"dur":5,"text":"and then also this Mah Meri ritual in Malaysia."},"2197":{"dur":2,"text":"So, the camera that we're using there are\nothers."},"2200":{"dur":3,"text":"This is still about the best around in terms\nof resolution."},"2203":{"dur":5,"text":"There are cheaper ones but this is pretty\nmuch where the technology is at the moment."},"2208":{"dur":4,"text":"And like I say, the main applications are\naround security or the main applications before"},"2213":{"dur":2,"text":"the cultural heritage stuff is about security."},"2216":{"dur":2,"text":"We've done some projects with Rio around remote\noperations."},"2219":{"dur":6,"text":"ECU are currently doing some work around performance\nof teachers and school rooms and I'll show"},"2225":{"dur":3,"text":"you some orchestra sort of work in that area."},"2228":{"dur":5,"text":"And then sports science, I've been doing some\nexploratory work on using these immersive"},"2233":{"dur":6,"text":"displays which you need to capture some data\nfor, for presenting sport scenarios and doing"},"2240":{"dur":3,"text":"evaluation of lead athletes."},"2244":{"dur":3,"text":"So, this is a performance sort of evaluation."},"2247":{"dur":4,"text":"This is just a single shot just to show you\nwhat comes off the camera."},"2252":{"dur":5,"text":"And if you think about what an Earth map looks\nlike, this is the same sort of projection."},"2257":{"dur":3,"text":"You might imagine that if you walk off here\nyou come in here."},"2260":{"dur":5,"text":"I don't know if you can see anything wrapping\naround, but that's the end of this same structure"},"2266":{"dur":1,"text":"here."},"2267":{"dur":2,"text":"So, the camera is capturing 360 degrees."},"2269":{"dur":5,"text":"It's capturing pretty high resolution as a\nvideo stream."},"2275":{"dur":4,"text":"And then the North Pole is stretched across\nthe top so that's why it looks distorted."},"2279":{"dur":3,"text":"But then if you look at this in the correct\nway it doesn't look distorted."},"2283":{"dur":1,"text":"It looks quite natural."},"2284":{"dur":6,"text":"So, one of the nice things about capturing\nthe video like this is the way you can repurpose"},"2291":{"dur":1,"text":"this."},"2292":{"dur":4,"text":"So, one of the devices that will be in the\nJohn Curtain Gallery is a cylindrical display."},"2296":{"dur":2,"text":"So, this is one way of capturing material."},"2298":{"dur":5,"text":"You can take a stand and video camera and\nrecord stuff for that display."},"2304":{"dur":4,"text":"So, if you record everything in this room,\nI put the camera in the centre and record"},"2309":{"dur":1,"text":"everything."},"2310":{"dur":2,"text":"You can then extract out these other assets\nfrom that."},"2312":{"dur":5,"text":"So, this is a cylindrical projection and these\nare the types of displays that you might present"},"2317":{"dur":1,"text":"that-- present that in."},"2319":{"dur":4,"text":"And, of course, you can do the same thing\nfor a dome environment."},"2324":{"dur":4,"text":"Again, you've captured everything so generating\na fish-eye is only half of everything."},"2328":{"dur":5,"text":"So, you can generate an arbitrary number of\nfish eyes and this is sort of the iDome and"},"2334":{"dur":5,"text":"sort of other opportunities for how you might\npresent this material."},"2339":{"dur":7,"text":"The remote operations was around iron ore\nship-loaders at the Karratha Port and so the"},"2347":{"dur":3,"text":"requirement here is that the operator needs\nto see everything that is happening."},"2350":{"dur":4,"text":"So, the operator is normally sitting out--\nover top of the ship and can look any direction."},"2355":{"dur":2,"text":"And so they're going to put cameras in there\nand they need this same ability."},"2358":{"dur":5,"text":"And doing that with street cameras has problems\nwith the operator sort of being able to identify"},"2363":{"dur":2,"text":"which camera comes after which camera."},"2366":{"dur":6,"text":"But also, it's not a seamless-- it's not a\nseamless image and some of the sports line"},"2372":{"dur":5,"text":"stuff, which again is about presenting sort\nof immersive content."},"2378":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay, so the last part of the Ngintaka story\nis this cave."},"2382":{"dur":4,"text":"This cave is actually where-- is Ngintaka's\nbelly so they've killed the lizard and this"},"2387":{"dur":3,"text":"is his belly."},"2390":{"dur":6,"text":"And per my last shot, the images that you're\ngoing to get here are 360 this way and 180."},"2397":{"dur":1,"text":"This is a still."},"2398":{"dur":2,"text":"The ladybug only captures down to about minus\n140."},"2401":{"dur":4,"text":"So, this is a quick bit of footage from that."},"2405":{"dur":9,"text":"So, these are the storytellers over here on\nthis low resolution screen and this is the"},"2414":{"dur":4,"text":"dance that occurs while they're telling the\nstory."},"2419":{"dur":5,"text":"And this makes it obvious that this is a 360\nbecause as he walks off here he comes in over"},"2424":{"dur":3,"text":"here, because that sort of splits here."},"2427":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is how you might look at that inside\nthe iDome environment."},"2431":{"dur":3,"text":"Sorry about the flashing; that's some sort\nof interference between my camera and the"},"2435":{"dur":1,"text":"projector."},"2436":{"dur":3,"text":"It's not in the real thing."},"2439":{"dur":5,"text":"Of course, an iDome, an environment like this\npresents with 180 degrees and we have 360"},"2444":{"dur":1,"text":"degrees."},"2445":{"dur":4,"text":"So, you can see you can navigate in this environment\nto look around and concentrate in what you're"},"2450":{"dur":1,"text":"interested in concentrating on."},"2451":{"dur":5,"text":"Okay, so to finish off another project from\nearlier this year, as I mentioned."},"2456":{"dur":6,"text":"I haven't mentioned it yet, was the Mah Meri,\nthis remote tribe in Malaysia, West Malaysia"},"2462":{"dur":6,"text":"and again, this was a cultural heritage project\ntoo from coming out of the University of Malaya"},"2468":{"dur":5,"text":"to record the, this ritual that they do."},"2474":{"dur":1,"text":"It's about healing."},"2476":{"dur":2,"text":"So, basically someone in the village gets\nsick."},"2479":{"dur":7,"text":"The priestess wise woman of the village goes\ninto a-- goes into a special room, has a dream,"},"2486":{"dur":5,"text":"imagines what the evil spirit of the sickness\nlooks like, conveys that to a carver who creates"},"2492":{"dur":1,"text":"a mask of their spirit."},"2493":{"dur":4,"text":"They put the mask on the patient, then they\nperform the ritual, which I'll show you in"},"2497":{"dur":1,"text":"a minute around that patient."},"2499":{"dur":5,"text":"They then take the mask, put it in the river\nand hopefully the patient gets better."},"2504":{"dur":7,"text":"So, it was about recording both the masks,\nwhich as
