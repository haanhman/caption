things\nthat are killing the bees."},"134":{"dur":2,"text":"Number one is overuse of chemicals;"},"136":{"dur":2,"text":"two, is diseases, mites,\nand other pathogens;"},"139":{"dur":3,"text":"and also, the lack of year-round\ndiverse habitat."},"144":{"dur":3,"text":"And the thing is, no matter\nwhat chemicals that we're talking about,"},"147":{"dur":2,"text":"and no matter what diseases\nthey may encounter,"},"150":{"dur":4,"text":"without good, nutritional food\nyear-round, these bees can't survive."},"155":{"dur":1,"text":"None of us could."},"157":{"dur":2,"text":"You see, we can't do\nthis pollination by hand."},"160":{"dur":2,"text":"That's not what we mean\nwhen we say we want job creation."},"163":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"165":{"dur":2,"text":"So, what do these bees do\nto help produce our food?"},"169":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, very broadly and very simply,"},"172":{"dur":3,"text":"they go to visit a flower\nto feed on their pollen or nectar source,"},"176":{"dur":3,"text":"and when they pass by the pollen,\nsome of it gets on their body,"},"179":{"dur":1,"text":"and when they fly to the next flower,"},"181":{"dur":2,"text":"some of it drops off\nand fertilizes the flower,"},"183":{"dur":1,"text":"thus producing fruit."},"186":{"dur":4,"text":"There are honey bees, and these are\nkind of the poster child for pollination."},"190":{"dur":2,"text":"They live in hives\nwith thousands of other bees."},"193":{"dur":2,"text":"But then, there are native bees."},"196":{"dur":3,"text":"These guys come in all shapes,\ncolors, sizes, and textures,"},"200":{"dur":2,"text":"just like the plants that they pollinate."},"203":{"dur":3,"text":"We've been told stories as if honey bees\nare the only bee out there,"},"207":{"dur":1,"text":"but really, they're only one"},"208":{"dur":3,"text":"out of over 4,000 species\nin the U.S. alone."},"213":{"dur":3,"text":"There's three main reasons\nwhy I think focusing on native bees,"},"216":{"dur":2,"text":"especially for urban areas, is vital."},"220":{"dur":2,"text":"The first reason is by far, safety."},"222":{"dur":2,"text":"Honey bees will sting\nto protect their colony;"},"225":{"dur":2,"text":"they are social, they live in a hive."},"228":{"dur":4,"text":"But native bees,\n95 per cent of them do not sting."},"232":{"dur":3,"text":"They are solitary, and they live\nin the ground or in wood."},"236":{"dur":4,"text":"So native bees, they pollinate\nat about a 91 per cent efficiency rate,"},"241":{"dur":4,"text":"and honey bees only do so\nat about a 72 per cent efficiency rate."},"245":{"dur":3,"text":"It's been said\nthat just about 200 native bees"},"249":{"dur":2,"text":"can do the same level of pollination"},"251":{"dur":4,"text":"as a hive containing over 10,000\nworker bees in some instances."},"256":{"dur":3,"text":"And now, the final reason is cost."},"260":{"dur":3,"text":"Honey bee hive rentals\nare up to $300 a week in some areas."},"264":{"dur":1,"text":"California's almond crop alone"},"266":{"dur":5,"text":"spent $294 million\nin pollination services in one year."},"272":{"dur":2,"text":"And according to a USDA report,"},"274":{"dur":3,"text":"if we use native bees to supplement\nfor some pollination efforts,"},"278":{"dur":3,"text":"we can save up to $327 million."},"282":{"dur":3,"text":"That's like sending 11,000 people\nto a four-year college for free,"},"286":{"dur":4,"text":"or giving kids over 200 million\nfree school lunches."},"291":{"dur":4,"text":"Now don't get me wrong, we definitely\nneed honey bees for, well, honey."},"296":{"dur":0,"text":"(Laughter)"},"297":{"dur":3,"text":"And also for pollination efforts\nfor crops that may bloom"},"300":{"dur":3,"text":"up to two weeks earlier in the year\nthan native bees become active,"},"303":{"dur":1,"text":"including almonds."},"305":{"dur":2,"text":"But at the end of the day,\nall bees matter,"},"309":{"dur":4,"text":"and these efforts, they'll help\nboth native bees and honey bees"},"313":{"dur":3,"text":"without encouraging\nthe formation of hives in public areas."},"317":{"dur":2,"text":"So, here's our problem:"},"321":{"dur":4,"text":"Currently, bees live in an area\nfor as long as there are flowers in bloom"},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"for a handful of weeks out of the year,"},"327":{"dur":3,"text":"and then they need to be able\nto fly to their next habitat spot."},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"But some of these bees\ncan only fly about three blocks"},"333":{"dur":3,"text":"before they need more food,\nand can die trying to get there."},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"We've focused on building\nthese very large habitat spots"},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"but forgotten\nabout the little ones in between,"},"344":{"dur":2,"text":"which is almost like\nbuilding a city without roads."},"347":{"dur":3,"text":"But luckily, urban areas\nare in a very unique position"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"to offer almost stepping-stone habitats"},"353":{"dur":4,"text":"to help these bees move across\nthe urban and rural landscapes."},"358":{"dur":4,"text":"Because the biggest problem isn't,\n\"If we build it, will they come?\""},"363":{"dur":3,"text":"It's, \"If we build it, can they leave?\""},"368":{"dur":3,"text":"So what can we do right now\nto help these bees?"},"372":{"dur":3,"text":"The answer? It may have been\nunderneath us this whole time."},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"By changing the plants\nwithin our parking lots"},"380":{"dur":1,"text":"and our existing green spaces,"},"381":{"dur":3,"text":"we can actually save the majority\nof our native bee species"},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"and help conserve the composition\nof both our landscapes"},"389":{"dur":1,"text":"and our dinner plates."},"391":{"dur":1,"text":"So, how does this work exactly?"},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"I took a little area\nof Houston, Texas, downtown,"},"396":{"dur":3,"text":"mostly because I figure if I can make\nHouston, Texas pollinator-friendly,"},"400":{"dur":1,"text":"I might be able to do this anywhere."},"402":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"The first thing that we've got to do,\nno matter what city that you're in,"},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"is take a look at your native bee species."},"410":{"dur":1,"text":"Acquire that list."},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"I created an easy diagram"},"414":{"dur":3,"text":"that separates these guys\ninto five different analysis categories."},"419":{"dur":4,"text":"The bigger the bee's body, the farther\nthey can fly before they need more food."},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"You can see some of the small native bees\ncan only fly about three blocks;"},"427":{"dur":3,"text":"and the big ones, they can fly\nup to three quarters of a mile"},"430":{"dur":1,"text":"before they need more food."},"432":{"dur":1,"text":"Here's the area of downtown Houston."},"435":{"dur":1,"text":"I took about a mile-and-a-half section,"},"437":{"dur":3,"text":"and I figured, what if we just changed\nthe plants within our green spaces?"},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"Would that be enough to help these bees?"},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"In truth, for the extra large ones\nthat can fly pretty far, sure."},"448":{"dur":1,"text":"I put circles around each of these bees"},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"to show how far they can fly\nbefore they need more food."},"453":{"dur":4,"text":"If they touch or overlap, it's likely\nthat they'll be able to reach it in time."},"458":{"dur":3,"text":"For these large native bees,\nit's probably going to be no problem."},"461":{"dur":1,"text":"But, look what happens"},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"when we go just one\nbody-size category down."},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"There's already gaps of multiple blocks,"},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"and they may not\nbe able to reach it in time."},"471":{"dur":3,"text":"But, what if we add parking lots?"},"475":{"dur":4,"text":"We just almost quadrupled the amount\nof habitat space in this area alone."},"480":{"dur":1,"text":"And now look..."},"482":{"dur":3,"text":"Those large native bees,\nthey'll have no problem."},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"Same with the medium,"},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"the small,"},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"and even potentially\nthe extra-small specialists can make it."},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"This is what a typical\nparking lot looks like."},"500":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is what it would look like\nif it were pollinator habitat."},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"See, the thing is,\nmost of these parking lots"},"507":{"dur":3,"text":"already have planting regulations\nattached to them."},"510":{"dur":3,"text":"We're not saying decrease your parking\nor change your land use."},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"We're just saying use better plants."},"517":{"dur":4,"text":"There's a few take-home messages\nfor anyone trying to create habitat."},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"The first is you want to make sure\nthat each plant that you use"},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"takes up at least 15 square feet in area."},"528":{"dur":3,"text":"Bees need to be able to see or smell\ntheir next food source"},"531":{"dur":1,"text":"before they get there."},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"Sometimes with pollution,\nthey can't smell it."},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"But by planting patches\nthat they can see a lot easier,"},"538":{"dur":1,"text":"we ensure that they can get there."},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"We also want to make sure\nthat there's multiple blooms year round"},"544":{"dur":3,"text":"because bees don't just need food in July."},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"But food isn't everything."},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"We want to make sure\nthat we leave bare ground patches"},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"and pieces of driftwood\nfor these guys to nest in."},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"Notice how I said bare ground, not mulch."},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"They actually can't nest in mulch,\nso be careful where you use it."},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"And overall, we want to make sure"},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"that we maintain at least\na majority flowering plants"},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"to those nesting areas,\nabout 80 per cent to 20 per cent,"},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"because a lot of these bees,\nthey'll just be using this"},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"as a stepping-stone habitat\nto the next one."},"579":{"dur":3,"text":"There's additional things that we can do\ndepending on our area."},"582":{"dur":4,"text":"We can add boulders to the landscape\nto help maintain heat overnight"},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"so they become active\nearlier in the day."},"589":{"dur":3,"text":"Or, we can add fruiting trees\nto the corners of our parking lots"},"593":{"dur":3,"text":"because they're great\npollen and nectar sources"},"596":{"dur":4,"text":"and also, free snacks;\nno one complains about free snacks."},"600":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"This can change everything,\nbut it shouldn't stop at parking lots."},"606":{"dur":3,"text":"Here's Houston's lightrail\ndowntown corridor as it is right now,"},"609":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's green;"},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"but green is good, it's not great."},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is it..."},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"as if it were pollinator habitat."},"619":{"dur":3,"text":"Some of these flowers too,\nthey filter out contaminants in the water"},"622":{"dur":1,"text":"and help it infiltrate quicker."},"625":{"dur":1,"text":"Your backyard isn't excluded."},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"That's a great place to put stuff."},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"Beautiful flowers, a nice\nlittle vegetable garden in the corner."},"632":{"dur":5,"text":"Even balconies under three stories\ncan help contribute greatly to this cause."},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"Not only is pollinator habitat\nvital to their survival,"},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"but it's also way prettier to look at."},"645":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a secret way that we can\nmake our urban areas more attractive."},"650":{"dur":1,"text":"You might be wondering, okay,"},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"well, how does this compare\nto Denver, necessarily, and other cities?"},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"Pretty well, actually."},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"Almost every city"},"660":{"dur":4,"text":"has at least ten per cent of its land use\ndedicated to surface parking lots alone."},"665":{"dur":3,"text":"So, even in Denver,\nin a rapidly growing city,"},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"this can make a great contribution."},"673":{"dur":3,"text":"Parking lots are an eyesore\nand a poor use of land in my opinion,"},"676":{"dur":4,"text":"but just because they are\ndoesn't mean that they have to be."},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"Johann von Goethe\nsaid it best when he

it."},"715":{"dur":3,"text":"All we have to do,\nin the words of Ron Finley,"},"718":{"dur":1,"text":"is plant some shit."},"719":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"And I don't know
