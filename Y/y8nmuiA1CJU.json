making"},"1022":{"dur":4,"text":"decisions, what they're investing in\nand what they choose not to invest in,"},"1026":{"dur":2,"text":"is absolutely critical."},"1028":{"dur":5,"text":"My understanding of the\nCare UK decision around their other"},"1034":{"dur":4,"text":"businesses, is it's driven by different\nissues than the domiciliary care"},"1039":{"dur":4,"text":"business
