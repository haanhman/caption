We're losing 200 species a"},"557":{"dur":5,"text":"day, that are eliminated forever. The Earth\nis just as sick as everybody else is."},"563":{"dur":5,"text":"So what's the difference between modern medicine\nand natural medicine? Modern medicine is that"},"568":{"dur":5,"text":"an organism is controlled from inside the\ncell, that the genes control the organism,"},"574":{"dur":4,"text":"and heredity passes the traits, which is called\ngenetic determinism. That means if your mom"},"578":{"dur":6,"text":"had breast cancer, you might have breast cancer.\nWhat's crazy right now is that you have women"},"585":{"dur":7,"text":"that are going in and getting double mastectomies\nbecause their doctor told them that they have"},"592":{"dur":6,"text":"a chance to get breast cancer, because their\nmom had breast cancer, but that is not true."},"599":{"dur":4,"text":"That's actually been proven by a guy named\nDr. Bruce Lipton, who's a cellular biologist."},"604":{"dur":5,"text":"He once made one of the greatest discoveries\nof all time, that natural medicine is an organism,"},"610":{"dur":6,"text":"being us or any organism, a tree or something,\nis controlled from outside the cell. The environment"},"616":{"dur":5,"text":"controls the organism, which is called genetic\nadaptation. So we're basically going to adapt"},"622":{"dur":6,"text":"to what we're exposed to. That's what makes\nsense. Obviously if we drink a bunch of gasoline"},"629":{"dur":5,"text":"or something, that's gonna affect us.\nWhat exactly is a gene? A gene is a DNA segment"},"635":{"dur":7,"text":"that determines your individual traits, characteristics,\nor susceptibility to disease. Now if we look"},"642":{"dur":5,"text":"at it in natural medicine, the way that it's\nsupposed to be, that the genes get the signals"},"648":{"dur":5,"text":"from outside of the cell, that all the commands\nand body function is determined by the energetic"},"654":{"dur":4,"text":"reading of the environment, either the internal\nenvironment and the external environment."},"658":{"dur":5,"text":"It comes from the outside, in. We smell it.\nWe taste it. We're exposed to EMFs or something"},"664":{"dur":4,"text":"like that.\nModern medicine is just the opposite. It says"},"668":{"dur":4,"text":"that the genes get signals from inside of\nthe cell, which is impossible, really, if"},"673":{"dur":5,"text":"you think about it. All the commands and body\nmechanics start in the nucleus of the cells."},"678":{"dur":5,"text":"Right? How many times have you heard the nucleus\nis the brain of the cell? That's where everything starts."},"683":{"dur":6,"text":"Well, Dr. Lipton wanted to prove that wrong\nand actually removed the nucleus, the brain,"},"690":{"dur":7,"text":"from the cell, and the cell still was alive.\nThe cell still lived. It respirated. It went"},"697":{"dur":5,"text":"to the bathroom. It couldn't replicate, but\nit was living. It still lived."},"703":{"dur":7,"text":"So that means that modern medicine is completely\nwrong, that the outside of the cell, the cell"},"710":{"dur":5,"text":"membrane, is really the brain of the cell,\nbecause when he removed the cell membrane,"},"715":{"dur":5,"text":"it'd be like removing your skin. Then the\ncell died."},"720":{"dur":5,"text":"The reason I'm explaining that is because\nall disease starts at the cellular level,"},"726":{"dur":6,"text":"or all malfunction starts at the cellular\nlevel. We have 100 trillion cells. Cells clump"},"732":{"dur":8,"text":"together to make tissues. Tissue clumps together\nto make organs. Organs work to develop systems"},"740":{"dur":4,"text":"in the body. Then all of that together is\nthe human body."},"745":{"dur":6,"text":"So what really causes malfunction or what\nreally causes disease is the perception in"},"752":{"dur":7,"text":"alterations in cellular function from the\ninternal and external environment, what you're"},"759":{"dur":4,"text":"exposed to, the air you're exposed to, the\nenvironment you're exposed to, if you live"},"764":{"dur":5,"text":"in a big city as opposed to out in the woods.\nThat would be your external environment. Words"},"769":{"dur":4,"text":"that are coming in at you, the people that\nyou meet, those are all external things that"},"773":{"dur":4,"text":"would affect you and stress you out or cause\nsome negative harm."},"777":{"dur":4,"text":"The internal environment is really the majority\nof stuff we're gonna be talking about today,"},"782":{"dur":5,"text":"is how the internal environment affects you.\nThat's gonna be through the foods, the beverages,"},"787":{"dur":5,"text":"the heavy metals, the drugs.

Negative belief patterns, blocked"},"799":{"dur":6,"text":"elimination routes, which is one of the reasons\nwhy we have too many toxins coming into the"},"805":{"dur":4,"text":"body on a daily basis and not enough coming\nout, where your cells become confused and"},"810":{"dur":1,"text":"start malfunctioning."},"812":{"dur":8,"text":"Now if you look at the way that life is, in\ngeneral, every living substance or every organism,"},"820":{"dur":7,"text":"living organism, is composed of at least 80%\nwater, minimum. The Earth itself is composed"},"827":{"dur":6,"text":"of 80% water, minimum. The cells are filled\nwith water.

It's almost"},"838":{"dur":2,"text":"identical to sea water, but it's water."},"841":{"dur":6,"text":"What happens is the water in your cell and\nthe water surrounding your cell starts to"},"847":{"dur":6,"text":"become toxic, and your self-healing mechanism\nthat you were born with, the one that's the"},"854":{"dur":6,"text":"most powerful that you have, starts to fall\ndown. Your self-healing mechanism can't be"},"861":{"dur":3,"text":"activated. It's hard to activate your self-healing\nmechanism."},"864":{"dur":4,"text":"I talked about how your body is water. This\nis very interesting, because there was a guy"},"868":{"dur":6,"text":"named Masaru Emoto, who did a lot of research\non water structure and function. He found"},"875":{"dur":8,"text":"that the water can change by toxin exposure,\nyour thought patterns, belief, the frequency,"},"883":{"dur":7,"text":"exposing the cell to potentially dangerous\nconditions, or it can change when you expose"},"890":{"dur":5,"text":"the cell to healthy conditions as well.\nSo this is some of the findings that he found"},"896":{"dur":8,"text":"in the structure of water. So what a perfect,\nclean water should look like, the slide on"},"904":{"dur":5,"text":"the left. It's a crystalline structure, just\nlike your cell membrane is a crystalline structure,"},"910":{"dur":7,"text":"when it's normal and it has everything it\nneeds.

It has gates and channels that\nopen and close, and it can receive frequencies"},"923":{"dur":5,"text":"or signals and send frequencies and signals.\nThat's exactly what you want."},"928":{"dur":5,"text":"So what he did was he took two vials, one\nwith pure, clean water and another vial which"},"934":{"dur":5,"text":"was contaminated with toxins. He looked at\nit under a microscope, and this is what he"},"939":{"dur":9,"text":"saw. So you can see that the one that's contaminated\nwith toxins is altered and is malfunctioning."},"948":{"dur":5,"text":"One vial, he put the word \"thank you\" on it,\nwith clean water, and the other vial he wrote,"},"954":{"dur":4,"text":"\"You make me sick. I will kill you.\" Then\nhe tested the water again, and that's what"},"959":{"dur":1,"text":"he came out with."},"960":{"dur":6,"text":"He then wanted to see how sound affected your\nwater. So you can see that Bach's \"Air for"},"966":{"dur":5,"text":"the G String\" has a six-sided crystalline\nstructure, where heavy metal music completely"},"972":{"dur":7,"text":"breaks the structure of water. It can't function\nproperly. So even though the sound and the"},"979":{"dur":5,"text":"music that you listen to is very important.\nAfter he did all that, which were external"},"984":{"dur":4,"text":"factors on the water, trying to figure out\nhow that was gonna affect water, then he said,"},"989":{"dur":6,"text":"\"Well, I wonder if we can affect water just\nby thinking, just by thoughts.\" So there was"},"996":{"dur":5,"text":"a pond, and this pond was heavily contaminated.\nHe took a sample of it, the water, which is"},"1001":{"dur":3,"text":"on the left, before offering a prayer. There\nwas like three or four monks, I think, with"},"1005":{"dur":2,"text":"them.\nHe took a sample of it, and then they went"},"1008":{"dur":6,"text":"to the pond. They sat around, and they all\nthought positive thoughts, like love and blessings"},"1014":{"dur":5,"text":"and all this stuff, into the water for like\n15 or 20 minutes. Then they took another reading,"},"1019":{"dur":6,"text":"and that's what happened to the water. So\nthat is pretty amazing when you can think,"},"1025":{"dur":5,"text":"put good thoughts into something, and have\nit go from that contamination to a perfect,"},"1031":{"dur":3,"text":"angelic-looking crystal right there."},"1034":{"dur":6,"text":"The one thing that I'm gonna be talking about\nthis a lot later, that really worries me and"},"1041":{"dur":4,"text":"a lot of the physicians, the natural physicians\nthat are out there right now that are seeing"},"1045":{"dur":4,"text":"this in their practice, is electromagnetic\nradiation."},"1050":{"dur":5,"text":"What worries me is when you can't see something\nand you can't feel something, but it's there,"},"1055":{"dur":4,"text":"bombarding your body in a negative way, and\nyou really don't have any choice to get away"},"1060":{"dur":7,"text":"from it.
