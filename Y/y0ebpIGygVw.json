is."},"22":{"dur":3,"text":"Today, I would like to change the way\nthat you think of design."},"27":{"dur":2,"text":"Because, sometimes when we think of design,"},"29":{"dur":4,"text":"we think of this very uncomfortable chair \nthat is smooth and beautiful"},"34":{"dur":3,"text":"but, let's face it, you don't want to \nsit on it for more than 5 minutes."},"37":{"dur":1,"text":"So, if that's your idea of design,"},"39":{"dur":2,"text":"just throw that away, cause that's old design."},"42":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, new design is about a process,\nnew design is about a way of thinking"},"46":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's a way of thinking\nthat helps you solve problems."},"49":{"dur":3,"text":"Actually, many times they don't even\nhave to be objects in the end."},"52":{"dur":4,"text":"So, if design thinking is about a process and"},"56":{"dur":2,"text":"you don't really have \nto have an object in the end"},"59":{"dur":2,"text":"what happens if you \nuse design to save your life."},"61":{"dur":2,"text":"I want to tell you a story of this man,\ncalled Matthias,"},"64":{"dur":2,"text":"who was kidnapped by rebels"},"66":{"dur":3,"text":"and he used design thinking \nin order to save his life."},"71":{"dur":2,"text":"Design is divided into 3 parts"},"74":{"dur":1,"text":"there's research, there's creation"},"75":{"dur":3,"text":"and then there's making it all happen\nin a very strategic way."},"79":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, the first part of the process\nis to reframe the problem."},"82":{"dur":4,"text":"Because first we have to make sure\nthat we're solving the right problem."},"86":{"dur":1,"text":"So Matthias, locked up in his room,"},"88":{"dur":3,"text":"he knows that he can't really escape,\nbecause that's a bad idea."},"91":{"dur":2,"text":"He knows that he can't negotiate\nfrom the inside"},"94":{"dur":2,"text":"because that's up to whoever is helping him\nfrom the outside."},"97":{"dur":3,"text":"But he really knows that\nhe wants to do something."},"100":{"dur":3,"text":"So, he realizes that the best thing to do \nis to send a message to his family"},"103":{"dur":3,"text":"and tell them that his ok."},"107":{"dur":3,"text":"The second part of this process\nis to identify who you need to talk to."},"110":{"dur":2,"text":"Matthias, from his window, he could peak outside"},"113":{"dur":3,"text":"and see that his captors \nwere all dressed like militaries"},"116":{"dur":3,"text":"and they seem to work in a military-style hierarchy."},"119":{"dur":4,"text":"But he didn't really know, \nso he needed to confirm this theory."},"123":{"dur":2,"text":"The way to do this, was through interviews."},"126":{"dur":3,"text":"The way Matthias had interviews\nwas when these men would walk into his room,"},"130":{"dur":2,"text":"they'd bring him food,\nthey'd bring him water."},"132":{"dur":2,"text":"And one of them, in particular,\nwas interesting to him,"},"135":{"dur":6,"text":"he had a hooded sweater, but he was \nthe only person that would look him in the eyes."},"142":{"dur":4,"text":"In order to find out where he stood in the pyramid,\nif in fact it was in a hierarchy."},"147":{"dur":3,"text":"He performed a little experiment:\nhe asked this man for a Bible."},"151":{"dur":5,"text":"The man did exactly what Matthias thought he would do,\nhe said 'Maybe' and he walked away."},"156":{"dur":4,"text":"As soon as he walked away, Matthias ran \nto the window and peaked outside of the bars"},"160":{"dur":3,"text":"and saw that the man walked over to somebody,\nasked them a question"},"163":{"dur":3,"text":"who then went to somebody else \nand asked them another question."},"167":{"dur":4,"text":"This let him to conclude that, yes, \nit does work in a military style hierarchy."},"171":{"dur":3,"text":"Because Matthias couldn't go to the leader first."},"174":{"dur":3,"text":"It also let him to understand that \nhe was very low in that pyramid"},"178":{"dur":2,"text":"and therefore didn't really have much power."},"180":{"dur":3,"text":"He also never got the Bible."},"184":{"dur":4,"text":"Part of the observation process is also to\njust observe what's around you."},"188":{"dur":1,"text":"You don't know if you're going to use it or not,"},"190":{"dur":2,"text":"but just make sure you have it\non your list, that it's there."},"193":{"dur":2,"text":"So, outside his window he saw\nthat there was a tomato farm"},"195":{"dur":6,"text":"and he also saw a Coca-Cola billboard far\nin the distance and just took note of it."},"202":{"dur":2,"text":"Then we do insights."},"204":{"dur":3,"text":"Insights are a little 'aha' moments\nfrom the design process"},"207":{"dur":2,"text":"that aren't really solutions, \nbut they're the ones that help you"},"210":{"dur":2,"text":"find the opportunities later."},"212":{"dur":3,"text":"In this case he realized that\nthis hooded man was gonna be his best ally."},"216":{"dur":2,"text":"Because he was young,\nhe was inexperienced"},"219":{"dur":4,"text":"and he was most likely gonna be the one,\nwho would make mistakes."},"223":{"dur":1,"text":">From the tomato farm he thought"},"225":{"dur":4,"text":"'Well, if this is a cover-up,\nthey're gonna have to keep up appearances,"},"229":{"dur":2,"text":"so they're gonna have to go to \nthe market whenever there is harvest."},"232":{"dur":2,"text":"Which means we'll have contact with farmers'."},"234":{"dur":4,"text":"And Coca-Cola is not really gonna have \na billboard in a place without many people,"},"239":{"dur":3,"text":"so there has to be people around\nwherever I am."},"243":{"dur":2,"text":"Then from insights we go to opportunities."},"245":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, opportunities are not solutions per se,\nbut they are stepping stones towards them."},"250":{"dur":4,"text":"In this case, they would begin \nwith something like 'How might I...?'"},"254":{"dur":3,"text":"But usually they would begin with 'How might we..?',\nbecause designers work in a team."},"257":{"dur":4,"text":"But in this case he can't. \nSo 'How might I become friends with my captors?'"},"261":{"dur":5,"text":"Or 'How might I reach local farmers \nthat I know are nearby?'"},"267":{"dur":2,"text":"And then is the fun part, \nthen it's brainstorming."},"270":{"dur":4,"text":"Which is what many designers are known for \nthe big walls full of sketches."},"274":{"dur":2,"text":"Brainstorming is when all ideas count."},"277":{"dur":4,"text":"No idea is ever a bad idea \nand you put as many as you possibly can."},"281":{"dur":3,"text":"And usually start with 'What if...?'"},"285":{"dur":4,"text":">From brainstorming we need to prototype.\nIn order to prototype,"},"289":{"dur":4,"text":"Matthias needed to get closer to his captors\nand he wanted to get closer to the hooded man."},"294":{"dur":4,"text":"So, he walks up to him and he, you know,\nin his Latin-charm kind of way,"},"298":{"dur":4,"text":"says: 'Oh, why don't you tell me \nabout your girlfriend? Do you have anybody?'"},"302":{"dur":3,"text":"and he says 'Yes, but she's very far away\nand I can't really talk to her,"},"306":{"dur":5,"text":"because we're not allowed to have phones here\nand I can't really write love letters.'"},"311":{"dur":3,"text":"So Matthias says 'Awesome, I can help you."},"315":{"dur":3,"text":"Why don't we sit down \nand we'll draft some letters.'"},"318":{"dur":4,"text":"And so they sit down and, as you can imagine,\nthey start sketching them out"},"322":{"dur":3,"text":"and they all go wrong \nand so they throw drafts away."},"326":{"dur":3,"text":"And he starts to pull little pieces\nof paper and put them in his pocket."},"329":{"dur":4,"text":"Then he pretends like the pencil tip breaks \nand he puts that into his pocket"},"334":{"dur":3,"text":"and he goes back to his room\nand writes three notes, that say:"},"337":{"dur":5,"text":"'Help me! I'm kidnapped! Please call my father. \nI see a Coca-Cola billboard'"},"342":{"dur":3,"text":"But what good is an idea\nwithout an implementation plan, right?"},"346":{"dur":4,"text":"So, Matthias, first goes and \nbe friends again with this hooded man"},"350":{"dur":3,"text":"and he says 'You know, I'm locked up at my room,\nI'm tired all day."},"354":{"dur":4,"text":"I see that you have a tomato farm outside.\nWhy don't you let me help you? And I'll do some exercise.'"},"358":{"dur":3,"text":"He manages to convince them\nthat he works on a tomato farm."},"362":{"dur":5,"text":"And knowing how dangerous it could be,\nhe put these three notes into the tomato boxes"},"367":{"dur":5,"text":"waiting for partners to find these\nand then call his father."},"373":{"dur":3,"text":"So, he waits patiently."},"377":{"dur":3,"text":"And before I continue, I want to tell you\nthat this is a true story."},"380":{"dur":4,"text":"This happened in Columbia in the 90's\nand Matthias was not a designer,"},"385":{"dur":4,"text":"but he knew to understand people, \nhe knew to not rely on one idea"},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"and he knew to strategize \na good implementation plan."},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"which are the principles\nof design thinking."},"395":{"dur":5,"text":"So, to what happened, after some time, \nthis woman found a box"},"401":{"dur":4,"text":"she pulled out some tomatoes, this little piece\nof paper rolled out, and she called the father."},"405":{"dur":5,"text":"Then the father immediately called the people\nthat were helping with the negotiations,"},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"which was actually my dad, \nand how I know of this story."},"413":{"dur":4,"text":"So my father called the guerilla\nand they asked for a proof of life."},"418":{"dur":4,"text":"As soon as they asked for a proof of life,\nthey found that there were three antennas"},"422":{"dur":4,"text":"that lit up on the area where this phone call was coming from."},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"So they knew that he had to be\ninside this triangle"},"429":{"dur":5,"text":"but they didn't know where \nin that triangle, that's a pretty big area."},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"Within that triangle they found one billboard"},"436":{"dur":3,"text":"and they sent soldier up, who stands up\non the billboard with binoculars"},"440":{"dur":4,"text":"and under the principle of \n'if I see you, you see me' they only find"},"444":{"dur":4,"text":"three houses, and one with a tomato farm."},"449":{"dur":3,"text":"Matthias today is happily \nat home with his family,"},"453":{"dur":6,"text":"thanks to design thinking, whole \nlot of charisma and a little bit of patience."},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"So, can design save the world?"},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, not alone."},"463":{"dur":4,"text":"Because design is just a piece,\nit's a little piece inside of this giant puzzle."},"468":{"dur":6,"text":"And this giant puzzle has other pieces like\ndesign, like art, history...you name it."},"476":{"dur":3,"text":"Design is that little piece that has \nempathy, that has creativity"},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"and it has practicality, all in one."},"482":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's only this piece together \nwith all of the other pieces"},"487":{"dur":3,"text":"that we can really have\na chance of changing the world."},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you."},"492":{"dur":1,"text":"(Applause)"}}
