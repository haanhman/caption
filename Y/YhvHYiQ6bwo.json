women,"},"1374":{"dur":2,"text":"again, within this kind\nof religious structure,"},"1376":{"dur":1,"text":"was very comforting."},"1377":{"dur":2,"text":"And I found that the rules of--"},"1384":{"dur":1,"text":"it's called family purity."},"1385":{"dur":2,"text":"It sounds better in\nHebrew, I promise."},"1387":{"dur":4,"text":"But I found that the rules\ngoverning marriage and
