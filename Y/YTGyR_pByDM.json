The FCM is a heavy tank too, isn't it?"},"51":{"dur":1,"text":"It's all about the armor."},"53":{"dur":6,"text":"The 120 mm front armor plate and 80 mm side plates can block shots only from lower-tier vehicles."},"60":{"dur":4,"text":"You can't count on ricochets. Additionally, the tank is quite big."},"64":{"dur":4,"text":"At close range, enemy vehicles can hit it even without taking the time to aim."},"69":{"dur":2,"text":"The FCM is an easy and enticing target."},"72":{"dur":2,"text":"Experienced medium tank drivers,"},"74":{"dur":5,"text":"who know how to use support tactics, will immediately see the potential of the FCM 50 t."},"80":{"dur":2,"text":"Support is what this French tank was created for."},"83":{"dur":2,"text":"Its good characteristics will make it a pleasure to play."},"86":{"dur":4,"text":"Good view range and an accurate gun allow the FCM to fight from a distance."},"91":{"dur":7,"text":"Without any crew skills or additional equipment, its view range is 400 meters, and this is the top value in its tier."},"98":{"dur":5,"text":"If you mount Coated Optics, and train your crew with the Recon and Situational Awareness skills,"},"104":{"dur":4,"text":"and the Brothers in Arms perk, you will get an outstanding view range value."},"108":{"dur":4,"text":"The FCM can cause damage upon its own spotting while staying undetected."},"113":{"dur":4,"text":"For example, the standard view range of the IS-3 is 350 meters."},"118":{"dur":3,"text":"So, the French heavy can fire at him from the distance while remaining unpunished."},"122":{"dur":6,"text":"Maintaining the distance is key, because the FCM's size will give it away immediately if the enemy gets closer."},"128":{"dur":2,"text":"That's why you should use the terrain."},"130":{"dur":5,"text":"This tank performs well on hilly maps, thanks to the good elevation and depression angles of its gun."},"136":{"dur":5,"text":"The 90 mm armor-piercing shells can penetrate 212 mm of armor,"},"142":{"dur":4,"text":"giving the FCM the ability to penetrate almost any vehicle it might meet in battle."},"147":{"dur":4,"text":"The average damage per shot is 240, a relatively low value."},"152":{"dur":3,"text":"Eight shots per minute

penetration will cause a lot of trouble for the enemy."},"165":{"dur":6,"text":"Adding a Gun Rammer and Enhanced Gun-Laying Drive will reduce the reload time and aim time of the gun."},"172":{"dur":5,"text":"You can train the Gunner with the Deadeye perk to cause critical damage to the modules of enemy vehicles more often."},"179":{"dur":4,"text":"When keeping your distance is not an option, the FCM's excellent dynamics come in handy."},"184":{"dur":5,"text":"The FCM is one of the best Premium Tier VIII vehicle in terms of speed and agility."},"190":{"dur":3,"text":"Its maximum speed is 51 km\/h."},"194":{"dur":6,"text":"It accelerates rapidly, and, thanks to its wide tracks, neither soft ground nor pits and bumps can stop it."},"201":{"dur":6,"text":"The hull traverse and turret traverse speeds will be an unpleasant surprise for light tanks that like to circle around heavy tanks."},"208":{"dur":3,"text":"You'll definitely want to keep your front armor turned to their shots,"},"211":{"dur":4,"text":"and the standard 40 degrees per second of hull traverse speed will enable you to do so."},"216":{"dur":3,"text":"That traverse speed can be improved by the Clutch Braking skill."},"220":{"dur":5,"text":"Adding Improved Ventilation, Strong Coffee, and Gasoline will boost that traverse speed even more."},"225":{"dur":5,"text":"The Off-Road Driving skill is not required, as the FCM is already quite good at crossing bogs."},"232":{"dur":6,"text":"The FCM's speed allows it to take advantageous positions at the beginning of the battle, spot enemies, and get away with it."},"239":{"dur":4,"text":"However, you'd better have a retreat plan, because French armor won't let you hold a position."},"246":{"dur":6,"text":"Playing the FCM, you

FCM"},"266":{"dur":2,"text":"especially against tanks with high damage per shot."},"269":{"dur":4,"text":"However, those wide tracks can save the FCM from taking damage in some cases."},"274":{"dur":3,"text":"No, its tracks are not a black hole where shells disappear."},"277":{"dur":6,"text":"The chassis is a separate module, so penetrating the tracks doesn't necessarily mean that a tank's hull was hit."},"283":{"dur":1,"text":"A shell may pass under the hull."},"285":{"dur":6,"text":"Additionally, the FCM's tracks cover almost the whole side, adding 30 mm of armor to the 80 mm side armor."},"292":{"dur":8,"text":"So, to penetrate the hull, a shell needs to penetrate 110 mm of armor at a 90 degree angle, and even more at more acute angles."},"300":{"dur":4,"text":"Sometimes, the speed and weight of the FCM may entice you to go for ramming."},"305":{"dur":1,"text":"But you should remember its thin armor."},"307":{"dur":4,"text":"In ramming, many parameters are considered, including the armor of both vehicles."},"312":{"dur":4,"text":"So, you shouldn't ram heavy vehicles, but light ones had better stay out of your way."},"319":{"dur":4,"text":"The FCM is a vehicle for the tacticians; cunning drivers with experience in medium tanks."},"324":{"dur":7,"text":"It can change positions on the map quickly, inflict damage from long range, and ambush the enemy, all while going unpunished."},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"Preferential matchmaking makes battle conditions more
