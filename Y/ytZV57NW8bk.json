while,"},"452":{"dur":4,"text":"but by the end of the 90s, things were changing,"},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"and the US realized the Chinese,"},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"\"We couldn't shun China

sort of as a fluke,"},"489":{"dur":4,"text":"in 2008 when China was preparing for the Olympics,"},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"I was asked to go back there just for a few months,"},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"really, just to cover the games."},"502":{"dur":3,"text":"But when I got there, there was a lot more going on."},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"There was rioting in Tibet,"},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"and there was a lot of other issues going on."},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"Just by luck, someone had left around that time,"},"517":{"dur":1,"text":"and I ended up getting the job full-time."},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"So, it was meant to really be just a short stint;"},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"and I ended up staying for almost eight years."},"526":{"dur":1,"text":"And I returned to find a really,"},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"just a vastly different China."},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"I just did not recognize Beijing, for example."},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"The economic

produce on the market."},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"There were very few restaurants."},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"That had sort of changed in the 80s,"},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"but really by the time I returned to China,"},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"it was a full-blown market economy in many ways,"},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"and Beijing was transformed."},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"A lot of the old ancient neighborhoods"},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"were replaced by skyscrapers."},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"And a lot of my former students,"},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"who at that time, or back in the day,"},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"were very frustrated and pessimistic,"},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"had done pretty well."},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"Some of them, you know, one of my

like"},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"it had been helicoptered in from New Jersey."},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"(audience laughing)"},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"Another friend who was like a starving

really hot."},"603":{"dur":3,"text":"I came back in 2008 and it felt like"},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"a really special moment."},"610":{"dur":4,"text":"In order to get the Olympics, China won the bid in 2001,"},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"and as part of the deal,"},"618":{"dur":3,"text":"they had promised to do a number of things."},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"Make it easier for foreign journalists, for example."},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"Before that time, if you wanted to go report"},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"outside of Beijing, you had to get permission"},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"from the police, you had to apply."},"630":{"dur":1,"text":"And sometimes you got it, sometimes you didn't,"},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"and if you did, you would have an escort the whole time,"},"635":{"dur":2,"text":"and it just was pretty lousy."},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"So, they abolished that rule, which was great."},"641":{"dur":4,"text":"They promised to ease up on some internet restrictions,"},"645":{"dur":3,"text":"and they promised to allow protests,"},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"which was a huge thing."},"655":{"dur":4,"text":"The other thing that was really amazing was the internet."},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"People really felt like that was going to change things."},"663":{"dur":3,"text":"There were countless blogs you could read."},"666":{"dur":4,"text":"People just going off on criticizing the government,"},"671":{"dur":3,"text":"and a lot of freewheeling discussion."},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"YouTube, you could get YouTube,"},"679":{"dur":0,"text":"you get The

Twitter."},"688":{"dur":4,"text":"There was a real sense that maybe things would change."},"694":{"dur":3,"text":"Obviously, there was plenty of repression,"},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"but I think those first few months,"},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"people hoped the Olympics would change things."},"709":{"dur":1,"text":"The idea was like, well,"},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"the internet's gonna really challenge"},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"these crusty, old Communist Party leaders."},"715":{"dur":3,"text":"They won't withstand this kind of onslaught."},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"PS, it didn't work out that way."},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"As we all know, these crusty, old leaders"},"726":{"dur":3,"text":"figured out a way to control the internet."},"730":{"dur":4,"text":"And as for, kind of, I'll just show a few little things here"},"734":{"dur":0,"text":"as I talk."},"741":{"dur":3,"text":"Those protest zones actually turned out to be a mirage."},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"They set up three zones for people to protest,"},"748":{"dur":1,"text":"but in order to protest,"},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"you had to apply for a permit from the police;"},"752":{"dur":1,"text":"but when you went to apply for the permit,"},"754":{"dur":1,"text":"you were detained."},"755":{"dur":1,"text":"So, you never actually got out of the police station"},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"to organize your protest."},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"And then not longer after I arrived..."},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"There was this huge earthquake in Sichuan,"},"765":{"dur":4,"text":"and that was, you know, over 70,000 people died."},"770":{"dur":3,"text":"And I went down there, and it was a real..."},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"It was a really shocking, both because of the loss of life,"},"778":{"dur":1,"text":"and it was just a natural disaster,"},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"but because so many of the people who died were students,"},"784":{"dur":4,"text":"children, who were in schools that were very poorly built."},"791":{"dur":3,"text":"You'd have the schools were for wealthy people,"},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"the private schools, and they were standing;"},"796":{"dur":3,"text":"and then a few blocks away you'd have the poorly,"},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"the school for ordinary people, and that had collapsed."},"802":{"dur":1,"text":"And a lot of the schools, a lot of the buildings were fine,"},"804":{"dur":1,"text":"it was the schools that collapsed."},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think what was really shocking to me"},"808":{"dur":4,"text":"was that the parents who experienced so much loss,"},"814":{"dur":3,"text":"and they were, of course, very unhappy"},"817":{"dur":3,"text":"that their children were in these schools that collapsed."},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"And when they went to try to protest,"},"824":{"dur":2,"text":"and get some sense of justice,"},"827":{"dur":1,"text":"they, too, were detained."},"829":{"dur":3,"text":"And that was I think a real inflection point..."},"834":{"dur":1,"text":"When we kind of realize that maybe things"},"835":{"dur":1,"text":"were not how we imagine."},"837":{"dur":4,"text":"When I say we, I'm really talking a lot of western,"},"842":{"dur":2,"text":"western reporters and analysts."},"845":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm not sure if Chinese themselves felt as optimistic."},"849":{"dur":3,"text":"I feel like often we are more optimistic."},"863":{"dur":1,"text":"China's attitude towards foreign journalists"},"865":{"dur":1,"text":"is quite complicated."},"868":{"dur":3,"text":"In some ways they appreciate us being there"},"872":{"dur":3,"text":"to tell the China story, the China miracle story."},"875":{"dur":3,"text":"The story of 600 million people being lifted,"},"881":{"dur":3,"text":"or coming out of poverty in the last few years."},"884":{"dur":1,"text":"And they want that story told;"},"885":{"dur":4,"text":"but on the

next leader."},"3040":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Man] Thank you so much for coming."},"3042":{"dur":1,"text":"I wanted to change the gear a little bit"},"3043":{"dur":2,"text":"and ask you a question about

Chinese state journals"},"3064":{"dur":2,"text":"and newspapers and also the foreign journals,"},"3067":{"dur":1,"text":"like New York Times?"},"3068":{"dur":3,"text":"'Cause I previously personally also knew"},"3071":{"dur":2,"text":"a few New York Times journalists in China."},"3074":{"dur":2,"text":"I just feel like there's kind of a difference"},"3077":{"dur":3,"text":"that does not exist in how they were trained"},"3081":{"dur":1,"text":"and how they were educated,"},"3082":{"dur":2,"text":"but also because that they have,"},"3085":{"dur":2,"text":"they're working as a foreign newspaper."},"3088":{"dur":4,"text":"So, like, they will have more freedom in publishing"},"3092":{"dur":3,"text":"or talking about some of the issues."},"3095":{"dur":1,"text":"- You're talking about Chinese journalists"},"3096":{"dur":2,"text":"who also work for Chinese publications, right?"},"3099":{"dur":0,"text":"- [Man] Yeah."},"3100":{"dur":3,"text":"- Yeah, I mean, listen I think it was two years ago"},"3103":{"dur":2,"text":"Xi Jinping made some kind of comments"},"3105":{"dur":1,"text":"that Chinese journalism,"},"3107":{"dur":3,"text":"I think it was to journalism

really hard."},"3144":{"dur":3,"text":"There was a period of time in the late 90s,"},"3148":{"dur":2,"text":"and up until really in 2012"},"3152":{"dur":1,"text":"until Xi Jinping came to power,"},"3153":{"dur":2,"text":"where there was some space for Chinese publications."},"3155":{"dur":2,"text":"Especially like these privately..."},"3159":{"dur":3,"text":"These new publications that

you remove that article now?\""},"3273":{"dur":1,"text":"And they're like, \"Okay.\""},"3274":{"dur":0,"text":"Ding."},"3275":{"dur":3,"text":"So, it's a lot of micromanaging content,

will be our last question."},"4367":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Man] Thank you, Andrew."},"4369":{"dur":2,"text":"You've been there eight years,"},"4371":{"dur":2,"text":"so I want you to give us,"},"4374":{"dur":4,"text":"tell us the three most encouraging trends you saw..."},"4380":{"dur":1,"text":"By the time you left China."},"4382":{"dur":3,"text":"And the three least encouraging trends."},"4386":{"dur":2,"text":"- I think environmental..."},"4390":{"dur":2,"text":"Awareness has been a huge thing."},"4393":{"dur":2,"text":"I saw that happening when we first got there."},"4396":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, China's very, usually polluted,"},"4400":{"dur":3,"text":"and ordinary citizens are very aware of the bad air,"},"4404":{"dur":3,"text":"and also just sort of chemical contamination"},"4407":{"dur":1,"text":"of soil and water."},"4409":{"dur":1,"text":"And there has been some movement."},"4411":{"dur":4,"text":"Environmental organizations are one of the few spots"},"4415":{"dur":3,"text":"where you can sort of advocate on behalf of that issue."},"4419":{"dur":2,"text":"Like I said, people actually protest."},"4421":{"dur":3,"text":"It's the one place you see protest is middle-class Chinese"},"4424":{"dur":4,"text":"will take to the streets for an environmental issue,"},"4430":{"dur":4,"text":"like a PX plant that's opening, petroleum kind of products."},"4436":{"dur":1,"text":"And, generally, as long as they're not violent,"},"4438":{"dur":2,"text":"and they disperse after one day,"},"4441":{"dur":0,"text":"they're generally okay."},"4442":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe the ringleaders will have some problems."},"4444":{"dur":1,"text":"So, that's one area."},"4446":{"dur":4,"text":"Animal rights advocacy is actually the one bright spot."},"4452":{"dur":2,"text":"Up until recently, China has had, you know,"},"4455":{"dur":3,"text":"it's a pretty bad place to be an animal."},"4458":{"dur":3,"text":"And there's been some great work done by young,"},"4463":{"dur":4,"text":"educated Chinese who have, one thing they do is,"},"4468":{"dur":3,"text":"you know, dog, people eat dogs, especially in the south,"},"4472":{"dur":1,"text":"but everywhere in China they eat dog meat."},"4473":{"dur":2,"text":"And a lot of those dogs are actually stolen dogs."},"4476":{"dur":1,"text":"There's no dog farms."},"4478":{"dur":2,"text":"Basically the dogs are stolen off the street"},"4480":{"dur":2,"text":"from people's front yards."},"4483":{"dur":0,"text":"They put them in trucks,"},"4484":{"dur":1,"text":"and they truck them to the slaughter houses."},"4486":{"dur":2,"text":"And what happens is these activists are on the highway,"},"4488":{"dur":2,"text":"driving around in their new Toyota,"},"4490":{"dur":2,"text":"and they see a truck piled high with dogs,"},"4493":{"dur":3,"text":"and they'll actually pull in front of the truck, block it,"},"4496":{"dur":3,"text":"get onto to Weishing and put out to the friends."},"4500":{"dur":1,"text":"And they all come out, and they block the truck,"},"4502":{"dur":2,"text":"and they'll have these standoffs with these trucks."},"4505":{"dur":2,"text":"And what they end up doing, the police will come,"},"4507":{"dur":1,"text":"and they'll end up paying for the dogs."},"4509":{"dur":2,"text":"It's like, \"Here, we'll give you $10,000.\""},"4512":{"dur":1,"text":"And they'll free the dogs."},"4513":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's amazing to see and, of course, there's a problem."},"4516":{"dur":1,"text":"What do you do with all those dogs?"},"4517":{"dur":2,"text":"That's a whole other issue."},"4519":{"dur":2,"text":"That's a real bright spot."},"4525":{"dur":2,"text":"The one-child policy has been relaxed,"},"4527":{"dur":3,"text":"was recently relaxed; now you can have two children."},"4530":{"dur":3,"text":"I think that's a really good thing for China,"},"4533":{"dur":2,"text":"for Chinese families, and for the Chinese economy"},"4535":{"dur":3,"text":"'cause China's gonna be aging pretty quickly, rapidly"},"4539":{"dur":1,"text":"in the next few years."},"4541":{"dur":2,"text":"So, that's probably good for China."},"4544":{"dur":2,"text":"Three things that I, God, there's so many."},"4547":{"dur":2,"text":"I would say ethnic, I think ethnic relations"},"4549":{"dur":2,"text":"are really at a low point right now."},"4552":{"dur":3,"text":"Like I mentioned, Uyghurs and Tibetans."},"4556":{"dur":3,"text":"I feel like they, and there's very little awareness"},"4559":{"dur":1,"text":"about this in China, but if you're a Tibetan"},"4561":{"dur":2,"text":"or you're Uyghur, you're really worried about the future"},"4563":{"dur":2,"text":"of your culture, your heritage."},"4566":{"dur":3,"text":"There's a sense that over time you will lose your language,"},"4569":{"dur":3,"text":"and many of your distinguishing kind of cultural,"},"4573":{"dur":1,"text":"their heritage."},"4576":{"dur":3,"text":"There's been a lot of erosion with that."},"4579":{"dur":2,"text":"I think obviously the legal sphere,"},"4584":{"dur":2,"text":"that was a real bright spot for a while."},"4586":{"dur":3,"text":"Chinese lawyers being allowed to take on cases"},"4589":{"dur":3,"text":"that would challenge the government obliquely."},"4593":{"dur":2,"text":"That's sort of dried up."},"4595":{"dur":4,"text":"A lot of lawyers have been detained, some jailed,"},"4599":{"dur":1,"text":"but mostly just terrified right now."},"4601":{"dur":2,"text":"So, people have sort of scaled back their ambitions"},"4604":{"dur":1,"text":"in the legal sphere."},"4606":{"dur":1,"text":"And then probably..."},"4610":{"dur":0,"text":"What would I say the third one is?"},"4611":{"dur":1,"text":"I guess the media."},"4613":{"dur":3,"text":"I think the Chinese media has really..."},"4616":{"dur":2,"text":"Sort of reeling right now."},"4619":{"dur":2,"text":"They're not sure really where to go"},"4622":{"dur":2,"text":"in terms of how to cover important stories,"},"4624":{"dur":2,"text":"and there's been a lot of,"},"4626":{"dur":2,"text":"yeah, it's hard to know where that's gonna go."},"4629":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I guess those would be my three."},"4633":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Sarah] Please, join me in thanking Andrew Jacobs."},"4635":{"dur":2,"text":"(audience applauding)"},"4637":{"dur":1,"text":"- Thanks for having me."},"4638":{"dur":3,"text":"I love your college; it's beautiful."},"4641":{"dur":0,"text":"And thanks, everyone."}}
