weeks."},"239":{"dur":7,"text":"[APPLAUSE]\nSo my first question here is really for Barak"},"246":{"dur":3,"text":"to get us started out this evening."},"249":{"dur":4,"text":"So the big general question for you, Barak,\nis why were you driven to choose the topic"},"253":{"dur":3,"text":"of cancer for a documentary?"},"257":{"dur":5,"text":">> Well, as I said before, ken Burns called,\nthat was the initial, that was the initial"},"263":{"dur":1,"text":"incentive."},"264":{"dur":6,"text":"But no, this was an incredible, ah, film making\nchallenge to begin with."},"270":{"dur":6,"text":"I mean to take on something that is this broad,\nthat is this deep, this scientifically challenging,"},"277":{"dur":6,"text":"emotionally challenging, it was really an\nopportunity to spread my film making wings"},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"much broader than I ever had before."},"285":{"dur":5,"text":"And it was also, I recognized pretty early\non, an incredible moment to be doing this"},"290":{"dur":1,"text":"film."},"291":{"dur":7,"text":"I was amazed by the unanimity of opinion among\nthe world class researchers we talked to,"},"299":{"dur":1,"text":"how optimistic they seemed to be."},"301":{"dur":5,"text":"They differed in terms of their time horizons,\nbut they all spoke with one voice in saying"},"306":{"dur":6,"text":"that we are at a threshold moment, that the\namount of data, the amount of information,"},"312":{"dur":5,"text":"the amount of knowledge about cancer that's\npoured in just in the last 10 years, has been"},"317":{"dur":3,"text":"just unprecedented and overwhelming."},"320":{"dur":5,"text":"And now, the trick is going to be to turn\nthat knowledge into effective treatments and"},"326":{"dur":1,"text":"therapies."},"327":{"dur":3,"text":"So the chance to bring that message to the\npublic that I don't think is quite aware of"},"331":{"dur":6,"text":"it, most of us, was just an amazing privilege."},"337":{"dur":1,"text":">> That's great."},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"And was there just out of curiosity, anything\nthat you had to leave out of the documentary"},"341":{"dur":1,"text":"that you wish you could have included?"},"342":{"dur":1,"text":">> No."},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"Everything we shot actually made it into the\nfilm."},"346":{"dur":1,"text":"No, I'm just kidding."},"348":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah."},"349":{"dur":3,"text":"We left out just so much great stuff."},"352":{"dur":6,"text":"I mean first and most especially, we had to\nleave out some wonderful patient stories that"},"359":{"dur":5,"text":"just didn't fit for one reason or another,\nand we tried to get them into the DVD as extras"},"365":{"dur":1,"text":"or onto the website."},"366":{"dur":4,"text":"But it's hard when you go through months with\na person and they open up their lives to you"},"371":{"dur":5,"text":"and their families, and you ride up and down\nthe emotional roller coaster with them, and"},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"then in the end, they're on the cutting room\nfloor."},"379":{"dur":1,"text":"That's really tough."},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"Not only that, there were many other stories."},"383":{"dur":6,"text":"There were great world reknowned figures who\nwe couldn't include for one reason or another."},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"But all in all, we got a lot in."},"392":{"dur":6,"text":"I was very pleased by the scope of what we\nmanaged to get into the series and I think,"},"398":{"dur":5,"text":"you know, most importantly, Sid gave it his\nblessing, which was, he's not a guy to please"},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"very easily."},"407":{"dur":1,"text":"So that was wonderful."},"408":{"dur":1,"text":">> That's great."},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"So we heard some pretty startling figures\nas we started to get into the documentary."},"412":{"dur":4,"text":"600,000 individuals die from cancer every\nyear, more people will die of cancer in the"},"416":{"dur":3,"text":"next two years than have died in combat from\nall the wars the United States has fought"},"420":{"dur":1,"text":"in."},"421":{"dur":3,"text":"The American cancer society's research was\nreferenced showing that one in two American"},"424":{"dur":3,"text":"men and one in three American women are diagnosed\nwith cancer."},"428":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's pretty overwhelming."},"429":{"dur":3,"text":"And we're hearing about some things that are\ncoming online."},"432":{"dur":5,"text":"But this is opening up to the panel and would\nlove the doctors to be able to speak to this."},"438":{"dur":3,"text":"What really is that next thing in cancer research?"},"441":{"dur":4,"text":">> Well, I'll start."},"446":{"dur":3,"text":"There has been enormous progress."},"449":{"dur":7,"text":"In fact, our population is getting older and\nit's also getting larger, so of course, there's"},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"going to be more cancer cases."},"459":{"dur":5,"text":"But if you correct per person the death rate\nfrom cancer has dropped 20% in the last 10"},"464":{"dur":3,"text":"years, which is a real achievement."},"467":{"dur":4,"text":"And parts of that have been in understanding\nbetter lifestyles."},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's not smoking."},"475":{"dur":3,"text":"Parts of it are studies that have been performed\nhere in Seattle, like the women's health initiative,"},"478":{"dur":7,"text":"which showed combinations of estrogen and\nprogesterone, increases their chance of getting"},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"breast cancer."},"487":{"dur":5,"text":"And by showing that, that study alone will\nreduce the incidence of breast cancer by about"},"493":{"dur":6,"text":"20,000 cases per year, that study that was\ndone by the group here at the hutch in preventing"},"499":{"dur":1,"text":"cancer."},"500":{"dur":5,"text":"But what makes so much of us so excited is\nthat we are understanding more and more about"},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"the genetic underpinnings of cancer."},"508":{"dur":7,"text":"We understand that cancer is at its heart\na disease that is caused by mutations in your"},"516":{"dur":1,"text":"DNA."},"517":{"dur":5,"text":"Your DNA is the information that tells a cell\nwhat to do."},"522":{"dur":6,"text":"And if there's a change in DNA from normal\nto abnormal, a gene no longer has its function."},"529":{"dur":5,"text":"And we are now at the point where we can find\nthose mutations and pinpoint what has gone"},"535":{"dur":1,"text":"wrong in a cell."},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"And what we find is different classes of mutations."},"539":{"dur":6,"text":"So there are some mutations that keep a cell\nfrom maturing, so the cell stays very young"},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"and it can't function."},"547":{"dur":4,"text":"There are other mutations that make a cell\nreproduce more rapidly."},"551":{"dur":7,"text":"And when you get combinations of those mutations\nso that a cell can reproduce, but can't function,"},"559":{"dur":5,"text":"so think of a teenager, it can reproduce,\nit can't function."},"564":{"dur":4,"text":"[LAUGHTER]\nThat's a cancer cell."},"569":{"dur":9,"text":"And what's so exciting now is that we can\nlook at the entire DNA of a cancer cell and"},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"find out exactly what is wrong within it."},"581":{"dur":7,"text":"And to give you an idea of what that means,\nin 2003, we were able to sequence the entire"},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"human genome for the first time."},"590":{"dur":6,"text":"And that took us several billion dollars and\n10 years."},"597":{"dur":6,"text":"Several billion dollars and 10 years to sequence\none DNA the first time."},"604":{"dur":5,"text":"The ability to do that has improved in its\nefficiency by a million fold."},"610":{"dur":5,"text":"And so now, instead of taking 10 years and\na billion dollars, we can do it in a week"},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"for a thousand dollars."},"617":{"dur":1,"text":"Which means that we can take..."},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"[APPLAUSE]\nIt's amazing."},"622":{"dur":6,"text":"Which means that we can take anyone's cancer\ncell and find out exactly what has gone wrong"},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"within it."},"629":{"dur":5,"text":"And that gives us the tools to develop new\ntherapies to target those mutations."},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"And there are several ways that we can think\nabout doing it."},"639":{"dur":6,"text":"One of them is by developing small molecules\nthat can inhibit those abnormal functions."},"646":{"dur":6,"text":"And the second is by using the power of the\nhuman immune system, as you heard in the eloquent"},"652":{"dur":4,"text":"discussion by Carl June, and I'll turn the\nmicrophone over to Phil in one second, that"},"657":{"dur":3,"text":"kind of therapy really began in Seattle, that\ndevelopment of immune therapy."},"661":{"dur":4,"text":"So we can target the immune system against\nthose things that have gone wrong in those"},"665":{"dur":1,"text":"cells."},"666":{"dur":1,"text":"So those two revolutions."},"668":{"dur":4,"text":"The revolution of being able to see what's\nwrong in a cancer cell and the revolution"},"673":{"dur":4,"text":"of being able to target those abnormalities\nusing the human immune system and those other"},"677":{"dur":5,"text":"molecules is what makes us so incredibly excited."},"682":{"dur":1,"text":">> Thanks."},"684":{"dur":7,"text":"I think what Fred is saying, we both grew\nup in the medicine era when cancer therapy"},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"actually first came online."},"693":{"dur":5,"text":"When it went from where people said this is\nincurable to the evidence that there were"},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"actually some drugs that could change that."},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"And that was extraordinarily exciting and\nequally horrifying."},"705":{"dur":8,"text":"Because the consequence of those drugs to\nthe majority of those patients was very destructive."},"714":{"dur":1,"text":"But some patients actually survived from it."},"715":{"dur":7,"text":"And we saw, I think all of us who were investigators\nand saw an opportunity here, we said, we can"},"723":{"dur":1,"text":"do better, we can all do better."},"725":{"dur":1,"text":"And the question is how?"},"726":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think Fred's kind of outlined some of\nthe technologies that came online."},"730":{"dur":4,"text":"We said, there's got to be something more\nspecial about the cancer cell that distinguishes"},"735":{"dur":5,"text":"it from a normal cell, that you can target\nit, so you can get that cell and not get normal"},"740":{"dur":1,"text":"cells at the same time."},"742":{"dur":4,"text":"So drugs have gotten better, and that's largely\nbecause we actually understand now what is"},"746":{"dur":4,"text":"the genetic abnormality in a cancer cell that\nmakes it different, that you can target that."},"751":{"dur":5,"text":"But one of the problems with targeted drugs\nis that although you can target specific changes"},"757":{"dur":5,"text":"in a tumor cell, it turns out that a tumor\ncell is reasonably adaptive and can ultimately"},"763":{"dur":3,"text":"evade any one of these individual drugs pretty\nroutinely."},"767":{"dur":5,"text":"Ando many of these drugs have activities,\nbut then ultimately, the tumor escapes, and"},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"then you wind up running out of drugs that\ncan work, particularly drugs that can work"},"776":{"dur":2,"text":"without much toxicity."},"779":{"dur":3,"text":"So my lab, I was trained as an immunologist."},"782":{"dur":4,"text":"And when I looked, after I was done trying\nto understand what the immune system does,"},"786":{"dur":4,"text":"and basically, the immune system evolved to\nhelp us recognize pathogens."},"791":{"dur":4,"text":"That was the evolution of the immune system,\nto protect us from foreign invaders, and the"},"795":{"dur":3,"text":"foreign invaders were all viruses and bacteria."},"798":{"dur":3,"text":"But the immune system is incredibly good at\nthat."},"802":{"dur":5,"text":"Obviously, it occasionally fails from some\ninfections as we know, but for most infections,"},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"we get infected, we get sick, and we get better."},"810":{"dur":4,"text":"And we get better because the immune system\ncompletely eliminates what's foreign about"},"814":{"dur":2,"text":"the bacteria or the virus."},"816":{"dur":3,"text":"And we try to figure out, is there a way that\nwe can manipulate the immune system so that"},"820":{"dur":6,"text":"we can do that to a tumor, so that it can't\nescape, the immune system will persist and"},"826":{"dur":1,"text":"recognize those disparities."},"828":{"dur":4,"text":"And Carl tried to explain what one of the\nstrategies is."},"832":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's a really remarkable strategy that's\nbeen incredibly effective in particular B"},"837":{"dur":4,"text":"cell immunities."},"841":{"dur":1,"text":"But that's the tip of the iceberg right now."},"843":{"dur":4,"text":"I think there's very little question that\nwe can manipulate the immune system to target"},"848":{"dur":1,"text":"a variety of cancers."},"849":{"dur":7,"text":"Our lab is heavily invested in targeting ovarian\ncancer, lung cancer right now."},"856":{"dur":2,"text":"There are strategies that are being developed\nfor breast cancer."},"859":{"dur":4,"text":"There's no question whether we this can be\ndone."},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"The problem is actually having the time and\nresources to do it."},"866":{"dur":6,"text":"But the face of how cancer is treated by oncologists\nis going to be very different in the next"},"872":{"dur":1,"text":"decade and the decade after that."},"874":{"dur":2,"text":"And it has been for all these decades before\nthen."},"876":{"dur":10,"text":"I think it really bears a lot of promise for\nthe future."},"886":{"dur":1,"text":">> Thank you."},"887":{"dur":1,"text":"[APPLAUSE]\n>> And be thinking about questions."},"888":{"dur":3,"text":"In a short while here, we'll be opening it\nup to the audience to come up and ask some"},"892":{"dur":1,"text":"questions of the panel."},"893":{"dur":5,"text":"Before we get to that, though, Wendy, you've\njoined us today as a survivor of breast cancer."},"899":{"dur":5,"text":"And the documentary really touched on the\nbriefly on breast cancer and the different"},"904":{"dur":6,"text":"types of surgeries that were practiced, for\nexample, lumpectomy versus the radical mastectomy."},"911":{"dur":6,"text":"Can you tell us a little bit about your diagnosis\nand maybe just how your thinking went as you"},"918":{"dur":3,"text":"looked at the different types of procedures,\nand what was that experience with looking"},"921":{"dur":2,"text":"at that and getting that information?"},"923":{"dur":1,"text":">> Okay."},"924":{"dur":5,"text":"First, I would just like to quickly tell you\nabout my diagnosis, so you would just understand"},"930":{"dur":1,"text":"my state of mind."},"932":{"dur":7,"text":"So I detected the tumor, I went to my doctor,\nshe couldn't feel it."},"939":{"dur":1,"text":"This happened a couple of times."},"941":{"dur":5,"text":"I had a mammogram and the mammogram didn't\ndetect anything."},"946":{"dur":3,"text":"About four months later, this was over the\nspace of about six months."},"949":{"dur":6,"text":"Four months later, I went to the doctor for\nsomething else, and I asked her to feel the"},"956":{"dur":1,"text":"lump again, and this time, she felt it."},"958":{"dur":2,"text":"So she sent me to a surgeon."},"961":{"dur":2,"text":"And, um, so I went to the surgeon."},"963":{"dur":5,"text":"And he looked at my history, which I have\na history of benign tumors."},"969":{"dur":3,"text":"And he gave me the option of having the tumor\nout or not."},"973":{"dur":6,"text":"So I actually, not liking that type of tumor\nthat I had, opted to have it taken out, and"},"979":{"dur":1,"text":"I waited another month."},"980":{"dur":7,"text":"And, um, so on Wednesday, it was the first\nday of school, and so he took out the lump"},"988":{"dur":4,"text":"and he said, um, you know, I'm really worried\nabout you, I'm worried about the people outside"},"993":{"dur":2,"text":"in the waiting room, but not you."},"996":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's not because he was incompetent or\nanything, it was because of truly my history."},"999":{"dur":4,"text":"And the way the lump expressed itself, that's\nwhat they said."},"1004":{"dur":1,"text":"So that was Wednesday."},"1006":{"dur":4,"text":"So Monday, I called the doctor and, um, he\nsaid, you know what?"},"1011":{"dur":2,"text":"I have to tell you that I'm shocked."},"1013":{"dur":3,"text":"It turns out that you do have cancer."},"1016":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's lobular, and this isn't a really\ngood thing."},"1020":{"dur":4,"text":"It's like a small percentage of cancers, like\n5% are lobular."},"1024":{"dur":2,"text":"And I want to you come to my office on Wednesday."},"1026":{"dur":6,"text":"So I went in on Wednesday, and he said, um,\nyou know, all breasts must go."},"1033":{"dur":1,"text":"That's it."},"1034":{"dur":3,"text":"And, um, so that was, I was shocked, it was\nonly a week."},"1038":{"dur":3,"text":"I really didn't think this was cancer Monday."},"1042":{"dur":4,"text":"Two days prior, I received this news."},"1046":{"dur":3,"text":"And it was really hard to process."},"1049":{"dur":2,"text":"I went straight to Ray's boathouse to the\nbar."},"1051":{"dur":1,"text":"I remember that."},"1052":{"dur":1,"text":"Two martinis."},"1053":{"dur":4,"text":"[LAUGHTER]\nSo I had, the fellow who did, the radiologist"},"1058":{"dur":6,"text":"who looked at my films on the Monday MRI,\nbecause I went straight from the diagnosis"},"1064":{"dur":3,"text":"to the MRI machine, called me at home."},"1068":{"dur":5,"text":"And a radiologist has never done that, had\nnot done that, and to this day, has not called"},"1073":{"dur":1,"text":"me at home."},"1074":{"dur":1,"text":"And to talk to me about the diagnosis."},"1076":{"dur":1,"text":"And what he had seen."},"1078":{"dur":3,"text":"And in the course of the conversation, he\nsaid, um, do you have any questions?"},"1081":{"dur":7,"text":"And I said well, yeah, the surgeon just said\nthat I needed bilateral mastectomy and I'm"},"1089":{"dur":2,"text":"kind of upset about this."},"1091":{"dur":2,"text":"And he said, you know what?"},"1093":{"dur":3,"text":"Um, I don't know if, I want you to think about\nthis."},"1097":{"dur":6,"text":"Because really, the technology we have right\nnow, um, we are going to keep a really, um,"},"1103":{"dur":1,"text":"firm eye on you."},"1104":{"dur":5,"text":"We're going to look at you all the time and\nwe're gonna monitor you, and give this the"},"1110":{"dur":5,"text":"bilateral mastectomy, a second thought."},"1115":{"dur":5,"text":"It was interesting because I had talked to\na bunch of friends, cancer, there's probably"},"1121":{"dur":5,"text":"a lot of you out there, breast cancer survivors\nwho have faced this decision."},"1127":{"dur":6,"text":"Even stage 0 and stage 1 survivors are getting\nbilaterals, so at least they were at that"},"1133":{"dur":4,"text":"time, just to say I never want to look at\nthis, I never want to hear about this again,"},"1138":{"dur":1,"text":"just take them off."},"1139":{"dur":2,"text":"I couldn't get there with that thought."},"1141":{"dur":8,"text":"So, um, I decided, after a lot of conversations\nwith folks and trusting the technologies that"},"1150":{"dur":4,"text":"we have for imaging, to only have one breast\nremoved."},"1154":{"dur":2,"text":"So it was a hard decision."},"1156":{"dur":6,"text":"I had to do it quickly because of the amount\nof time that had gone by, the diagnosis, and"},"1162":{"dur":3,"text":"it was a really hard decision."},"1165":{"dur":4,"text":">> And just to build off of that for any of\nthe panelists, are we seeing this decision"},"1169":{"dur":5,"text":"making process better, what are your comments\naround that?"},"1174":{"dur":7,"text":">> Well, I first want to make it very clear,\nI'm not a breast cancer specialist."},"1182":{"dur":11,"text":"But I would say that one of the really exciting\nthings is that we understand that the characteristics"},"1193":{"dur":6,"text":"of not only the breast cancer, but of your\nown basic DNA, that is your germ line DNA,"},"1200":{"dur":10,"text":"tells us a great deal about the risk of developing\nbreast cancer, either unilaterally or bilaterally."},"1210":{"dur":9,"text":"So we're finding that, um, actually a surprising\nnumber of women who have breast cancer actually"},"1220":{"dur":5,"text":"were born with a gene that predisposes them\nto breast cancer and also predisposes them"},"1225":{"dur":1,"text":"to bilateral breast cancer."},"1227":{"dur":4,"text":"Of course, Mary Clare king deserves credit\nfor having discovered that."},"1231":{"dur":7,"text":"She's one of our own here in Seattle and has\ndone wonderful work."},"1239":{"dur":3,"text":"But that's not the only gene that predisposes\nto breast cancer."},"1243":{"dur":8,"text":"So we're hard at work trying to understand\njust the full spectrum of mutations that lead"},"1251":{"dur":2,"text":"to the development of breast cancer."},"1254":{"dur":6,"text":"So one of the studies that we're doing and\nwe're proposing, there was a study here in"},"1260":{"dur":9,"text":"Seattle where a large number of women agreed\nto be randomized to take post menopausal estrogen,"},"1269":{"dur":5,"text":"as they had, or not, to stop estrogen replacement."},"1274":{"dur":4,"text":"Those women are now mostly in their 80s, many\nof them, because they've been followed for"},"1278":{"dur":1,"text":"a long time."},"1279":{"dur":5,"text":"So we actually know what their ultimate risk\nof developing breast cancer is, or has

the ups and downs, the confusion"},"1393":{"dur":6,"text":"of not knowing what to do and be told different\nthings by different doctors, it was heartbreaking."},"1400":{"dur":6,"text":"And I think for

what's"},"1597":{"dur":1,"text":"going on."},"1598":{"dur":7,"text":"And as Francis Collins said in the film, this\nis the moment we need federal funding more"},"1606":{"dur":4,"text":"than any other

disagree that\nthere's a huge bottle neck and the federal"},"1639":{"dur":1,"text":"government is an enormous part of that."},"1640":{"dur":2,"text":"But it is a bottle neck that can be solved\nin a lot of ways."},"1643":{"dur":4,"text":"And the problem is that none of the ways are\nsolving it now."},"1648":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'll just give you an example."},"1650":{"dur":3,"text":"We successfully competed for funds from the\nfederal government to develop a T cell therapy"},"1654":{"dur":5,"text":"trial targeting acute myelogenous leukemia\nthat looks very promising."},"1659":{"dur":6,"text":"The amount of funds we get from the national\ncancer institute gives us enough resources"},"1666":{"dur":5,"text":"to treat three patients a year, which is what\nwe can do in less than a month."},"1671":{"dur":4,"text":"So the only way we can then get beyond that\nis to somehow find somebody else that's willing"},"1676":{"dur":2,"text":"to support that,

us."},"1685":{"dur":2,"text":"So we went to groups like stand up to cancer."},"1688":{"dur":2,"text":"And they've been spectacular."},"1691":{"dur":5,"text":"They've created what are called dream

year."},"1715":{"dur":3,"text":"And it just tells you that the amount of money\nthat any of these individual organizations"},"1719":{"dur":3,"text":"has is just totally
