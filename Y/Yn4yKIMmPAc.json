That's the best way to put it.\nAnd you use different is it polyester threads that you use?"},"523":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah, it is a polyester."},"524":{"dur":8,"text":"And, also, I was quite surprised when you brought this out.\nIt\u00eds a little bit like a colour chart for thread isn\u00edt it?"},"532":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah it's lots of fun."},"533":{"dur":5,"text":"But it's amazing. It's a beautiful chart on its own,\nbut you can see all the lusters in the threads themselves."},"539":{"dur":4,"text":"Yeah, they're good.

And, the sewing machine. What type of sewing machine\ndo you use and why are you using that sewing machine?"},"556":{"dur":4,"text":"I use a Bernina.

Or occasionally I'll forget to go back\nover a piece and I'll dissolve it and then"},"603":{"dur":5,"text":"I'll realize there's a bit that I haven't done or\nyou know, you learn from your mistakes though."},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"Ok, well, from there we're going to go\nYou've already sketched one up."},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"We\u00edll go to the sewing machine\n and actually see how this is done."},"614":{"dur":0,"text":"Cool."},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"Sounds cool."},"624":{"dur":3,"text":"I've just got it set up. I've actually got\ndifferent colours on the top and the bottom."},"628":{"dur":5,"text":"The reason for that is, you know, these are basically\nmy paints but they only come in one colour."},"634":{"dur":7,"text":"So if I want to have variations I can blend them together\nwhen I sew. So I've got it just set up in a way so that"},"641":{"dur":7,"text":"it's just the needle going up and down. It's not on anything\nfancy or anything like that. I'm drawing with this machine."},"649":{"dur":4,"text":"So I\u00edve as we know got it all stretched up.\nI always bring my threads up to the top,"},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"cause these threads will\n get all knotted if you don't."},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"And do you keep holding those \nthreads at all? Or do you let them go?"},"661":{"dur":7,"text":"What I'll do is I\u00ed'l just sew a little bit, and then I'll\nsnip them off. And then they're out of the way."},"668":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll just start drawing; \nit might get a bit noisy."},"670":{"dur":1,"text":"That's ok. Fire away."},"724":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll only do a little bit, so you can see."},"727":{"dur":4,"text":"Well as you can see, Meredith has only\njust partially completed this section."},"731":{"dur":5,"text":"And it's just amazing how she follows the little\nred lines and gets all the patterns done."},"736":{"dur":6,"text":"But because of the beauty of TV and that this young lady is\nincredibly well prepared, what Meredith has done for us,"},"742":{"dur":3,"text":"because it takes quite a long time to do this, at least a\nday or so's work to actually sew that like that\u00d6"},"746":{"dur":3,"text":"What she's done for us is that\n she's actually prepared one."},"750":{"dur":4,"text":"And as you can see, completely \nfinished and cut out of the frame itself."},"755":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, there's a really special technique that\nhappens now, which I've never seen before"},"759":{"dur":4,"text":"and which I think will be quite fascinating,\nyou get rid of this material don't you?"},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah. It\u00eds actually very very easy."},"766":{"dur":1,"text":"Tell us how that\u00eds done."},"767":{"dur":5,"text":"Basically I would normally do this under running water,\nbut so we don't have to shoot in the bathroom,"},"772":{"dur":7,"text":"I figured this would be much more TV friendly.\nSo, it needs to be warm water, so I've just boiled the jug."},"780":{"dur":5,"text":"And I'll just get that quite warm. So, basically,\n it'll be there and then it won't be there."},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"So I\u00edll just put it in a little bit, and you can see"},"787":{"dur":5,"text":"straight away it just kind of disappears.\n It turns into like a gooey,gluey substance."},"793":{"dur":3,"text":"So I\u00edll just kind of move this about in here."},"796":{"dur":0,"text":"That's amazing."},"798":{"dur":8,"text":"If I don't wash it out enough, there will be a little bit of residue\nfabric there, but I don't want to wash it out completely,"},"806":{"dur":4,"text":"because it actually kind of turns into a bit of a\nstiffening glue that will give it a bit of shape."},"811":{"dur":3,"text":"It's just amazing. It just disappeared that quickly."},"815":{"dur":5,"text":"Yeah, it's just gone. Here one minute, gone the next.\nNow as you can see I'm not particularly gentle with them."},"820":{"dur":5,"text":"And now this is quite wet. There's a bit of\ncolour that has come out, but that's not from the thread,"},"826":{"dur":2,"text":"that's from the pen that\n I used to draw it with."},"828":{"dur":8,"text":"So now all I do I just use \nsome baking paper, so that I don't"},"837":{"dur":4,"text":"make a huge mess of the bench.\n And I'll just lay this down and basically"},"842":{"dur":10,"text":"blot off the excess water. So once I'm happy\n with what I've taken off, some pieces I'll let to"},"852":{"dur":4,"text":"go really sculptural, and crunch them\n up to give them some extra shape."},"857":{"dur":5,"text":"This piece though, because it\u00eds wanting to curl, and I want it\nto be quite a defined shape to begin with,"},"863":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll actually press it flat."},"864":{"dur":6,"text":"And to do that I\u00edll just double layer my\n paper towel, my greaseproof paper sorry."},"871":{"dur":5,"text":"I'll make sure it's all nice \nand flat, as best I can."},"881":{"dur":6,"text":"This bit's a little bit fiddly if it's a really fine\ndesign it just want this to do its own thing."},"888":{"dur":1,"text":"Do you want me to hold that there?"},"890":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah.

So this is I'm really kind of fascinated with leaves,\nand the internal structures of leaves at the moment,"},"930":{"dur":3,"text":"so I've done a slightly larger one today."},"934":{"dur":5,"text":"And I really quite like this when \nit's floppy, but we need to mount it."},"939":{"dur":5,"text":"So I've just prepared this board. \nIt's just fabriano paper stuck to"},"945":{"dur":8,"text":"foam core, to give it some stability.
