they"},"173":{"dur":2,"text":"were supposed to build the\nKennedy Space Center here."},"175":{"dur":2,"text":"So they destroyed\nall the buildings."},"177":{"dur":2,"text":"And then Kennedy\nwas

here."},"193":{"dur":3,"text":"Anyway, so it's interesting\nfor me to be back."},"197":{"dur":2,"text":"My first job was at MIT."},"199":{"dur":4,"text":"I worked for the head of the\ncivil

to\na developing country,"},"220":{"dur":2,"text":"I have always hoped\nthat, really, nobody ever"},"222":{"dur":3,"text":"used those books at\nthe UN for anything."},"226":{"dur":2,"text":"So what I thought I would do\nwas, talk a little bit more"},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"about the book."},"230":{"dur":2,"text":"Because my publisher\nwould want me to do that."},"233":{"dur":2,"text":"And I do hope you'll get a copy."},"235":{"dur":2,"text":"And I would love to sign\nthem for you afterward."},"238":{"dur":2,"text":"And then what I'm actually\ngoing to read to you from,"},"240":{"dur":2,"text":"though, is a more\nrecent article that's"},"242":{"dur":4,"text":"more directly focused\non tech and how"},"246":{"dur":6,"text":"some of the issues effect\na place like, maybe Google."},"252":{"dur":2,"text":"So the book is divided\ninto a bunch of parts."},"255":{"dur":5,"text":"And it starts with sort of\nan investigative memoir."},"261":{"dur":3,"text":"When Larry Summers made his\nremarks, you know, I got upset,"},"264":{"dur":3,"text":"but I had actually\nknown Larry for years."},"268":{"dur":1,"text":"We went way back."},"269":{"dur":2,"text":"I was a debater and high school."},"272":{"dur":2,"text":"I was just nerdy in every\nway you could be nerdy."},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"And Larry was older,\nso he judged our team,"},"277":{"dur":5,"text":"and then I kept track of\nhim later and knew him."},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"So I got all upset that\nhe would have thought"},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"that there was even a\npossibility that one"},"287":{"dur":3,"text":"reason there weren't more women\nphysics professors at Harvard"},"290":{"dur":3,"text":"was because of any kind of\ninnate aptitude problems,"},"294":{"dur":3,"text":"or that women didn't want to\nwork hard-- as hard as men."},"297":{"dur":3,"text":"The other reasons he gave\nseemed to be more on target,"},"301":{"dur":3,"text":"that they were cultural reasons,\nand bias, and things like that."},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"So I actually sat down\nto write him an email"},"307":{"dur":3,"text":"to explain why I had really\nnot gone on in physics,"},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"even though I so\npassionately wanted to."},"313":{"dur":2,"text":"And the email just\nwent on and on,"},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"and I ended up with this\nlike, 20 page email."},"317":{"dur":1,"text":"And instead of sending\nit to him then,"},"319":{"dur":2,"text":"I decided to write a book, and\nthen I sent the book to him"},"322":{"dur":1,"text":"after it was done."},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"And he was good enough to--\nthere's a blurb on the back,"},"326":{"dur":2,"text":"and he said, oh,\nnow I see the light"},"328":{"dur":2,"text":"and I understand what I\ndidn't understand before."},"330":{"dur":1,"text":"So that made me feel good."},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"But I realized that I\nreally didn't understand"},"335":{"dur":1,"text":"why I hadn't gone on."},"336":{"dur":4,"text":"It was so painful for me to\nhave worked so incredibly"},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"hard to get that physics\ndegree and to do this research"},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"and stuff, that when\nI walked away from it,"},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"I really didn't want to ever\nthink about the part of my life"},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"that had wanted\nto be a physicist."},"351":{"dur":3,"text":"And so then I had to go back\nand really revisit everything."},"355":{"dur":3,"text":"And you know, part of it\nwas, as Jonathan said,"},"358":{"dur":1,"text":"sort of these external factors."},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"So I went to a not very\ngood, rural high school."},"363":{"dur":3,"text":"And I actually wasn't-- we\ndidn't have any AP courses,"},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"but there was a sort of\naccelerated track that a couple"},"368":{"dur":3,"text":"of boys got to take\nin science and math."},"372":{"dur":3,"text":"And I wasn't allowed to do it\nbecause, as the principal said,"},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"girls don't go on in\nscience and math anyways,"},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"so you would just\nbe wasting a seat."},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"And besides, it would\nruin your social life."},"381":{"dur":1,"text":"I didn't have a social\nlife, because if you're"},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"a girl at that age,\nand you're really"},"386":{"dur":3,"text":"good at science and math,\nthat doesn't help, anyway."},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"So I got very bored, and\nangry, and I stayed at home"},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"and taught myself what I\nthought were-- I was really"},"394":{"dur":3,"text":"reading about physics, but\nI thought I was actually"},"398":{"dur":1,"text":"And I taught myself calculus."},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"But when I got to Yale, I was\njust blown out of the water."},"403":{"dur":6,"text":"Because first of all, there\nwere 118 guys and two women."},"409":{"dur":3,"text":"And almost all of them had\ngone to really good schools,"},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"and had two years of high\nschool physics, two years"},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"of advanced calculus,\nand I had taught"},"418":{"dur":1,"text":"myself this stuff from books."},"420":{"dur":1,"text":"So I flunked my first mid-term."},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"And I was going\nto drop, which is"},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"what happens to many young\nwomen and minorities."},"426":{"dur":1,"text":"You get there and\nrealize that you"},"428":{"dur":3,"text":"have had a terrible background,\nyou flunk your first test,"},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"and of course those\ncourses are even"},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"called weed out courses, right?"},"435":{"dur":1,"text":"So there's this ethos\nthat if you get there"},"437":{"dur":3,"text":"and you're not already\nlike, top of the pack,"},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"you couldn't possibly\nbe good or worth saving,"},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"and so let's weed out."},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"Luckily, I had--\nyou know, the book"},"447":{"dur":3,"text":"is not a story about villains."},"450":{"dur":3,"text":"I know that the '70s sound\nlike a really long time"},"454":{"dur":1,"text":"ago, you're mostly really young."},"455":{"dur":3,"text":"But it was actually-- didn't\nfeel much different from now"},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"in terms of sort of\nfeminism and sexism."},"462":{"dur":4,"text":"We felt, even then, that all\nthe battles had been fought,"},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"and that women\ncould do anything."},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"And I didn't feel\nlike a pioneer."},"471":{"dur":3,"text":"And I had really, really\nnice-- I had all professors."},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"There were no women professors."},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"But I had really,\nreally nice guys"},"478":{"dur":1,"text":"teaching me math and physics."},"483":{"dur":3,"text":"And so when I was going to drop,\nactually, it was very unusual"},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"but my freshman year\nphysics professor"},"488":{"dur":1,"text":"wouldn't let me drop the course."},"490":{"dur":3,"text":"And he gave me a very good\nadvice, and I stuck it out,"},"494":{"dur":3,"text":"and I worked incredibly hard."},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"And as often happens,\nif you come from behind,"},"500":{"dur":1,"text":"you overshoot the mark, right?"},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"And by the time I was a\nsenior, I was top of my class,"},"504":{"dur":3,"text":"and I had done\nall this research."},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"And so the fact\nthat I didn't go--"},"508":{"dur":1,"text":"and I had almost\nperfect grades, but I"},"510":{"dur":3,"text":"didn't think that I was good\nenough, because no one said,"},"513":{"dur":1,"text":"you're good at this."},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"No one said, are you\ngoing to grad school?"},"519":{"dur":3,"text":"And I thought, if I were good,\nsomeone would have said, go on."},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"Which is a big difference\nbetween most young women"},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"the most guys, that\nguys are raised more"},"527":{"dur":3,"text":"to make their own value."},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"Like, not look to other people\nto pat you on the head and say,"},"533":{"dur":4,"text":"yes, you're pretty, you're\ncute, you can do it, whatever."},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"And so women more need\nthis encouragement"},"540":{"dur":1,"text":"from the outside to go on."},"542":{"dur":2,"text":"I didn't have confidence,\nbecause I had come from behind,"},"545":{"dur":3,"text":"and I still thought\nof myself as behind."},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're the only woman in\nthe room, the only black person"},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"in the room, the only\nwhatever in the room,"},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"there's this-- it's\ncalled a stereotype"},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"effect-- but this self\nconsciousness where everything"},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"you do you feel like you're\nrepresenting your whole gender,"},"561":{"dur":2,"text":"or your whole race."},"563":{"dur":1,"text":"You feel self conscious."},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"Every time I would\ncross my legs in class,"},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"even though I was\nwearing jeans like,"},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"the professor\nwould stop talking."},"570":{"dur":1,"text":"It was so distracting."},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"So there were just\nso many distractions,"},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"and I was so isolated, really."},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"All the guys did their\nproblem sets together,"},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"and I was off just\nworking all by myself."},"582":{"dur":3,"text":"Nobody ever even talked\nto me in classes."},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"And so those were the\nfactors that I started"},"587":{"dur":3,"text":"to realize had really\nbeen debilitating,"},"591":{"dur":3,"text":"and the main reasons\nthat I didn't go on."},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"The second part\nof the book was, I"},"600":{"dur":4,"text":"wanted to see whether my\nexperience had been unique,"},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"whether anybody had ever\nfelt anything similar."},"607":{"dur":3,"text":"And I was really interested in\nhow it compared to young women"},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"today."},"612":{"dur":5,"text":"I assumed that things\nreally must have changed."},"617":{"dur":4,"text":"And so I was shocked when I--\nso went back to Yale to talk"},"622":{"dur":1,"text":"to the young women there."},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"I followed up with people\nI had been in school with."},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"But I was really\ninterested in young women"},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"today, and young women\nat University of Michigan"},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"where I teach, so I could\ncompare a public school"},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"to an Ivy."},"635":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was really shocked."},"637":{"dur":3,"text":"There were a few more\nyoung women in the classes."},"641":{"dur":4,"text":"But most of them seemed to\nbe saying that inside, it"},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"felt the same as I had felt,\nthat they weren't getting"},"647":{"dur":4,"text":"encouragement, they didn't\nhave the confidence,"},"652":{"dur":1,"text":"they felt isolated."},"653":{"dur":4,"text":"But also-- I think, this it was\nvery hard for me to admit it,"},"657":{"dur":3,"text":"and then I think for them\nto admit it to me, too--"},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"these beautiful, smart,\ncharming young women"},"665":{"dur":3,"text":"at Yale all saying to me,\nnobody wants to date us,"},"668":{"dur":3,"text":"because when we say we're a\nphysics major, that's the end."},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"Is anybody going to marry me?"},"674":{"dur":5,"text":"And I was like, can I really be\nhearing this at Yale in 2012?"},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"It just couldn't be."},"681":{"dur":1,"text":"And then they started\ntelling me stories"},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"of the teasing they\nhad been getting like,"},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"in junior high and high school."},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, I'm going to\ngrade you on the girl"},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"curve in your physics\nclass, and the boys"},"693":{"dur":1,"text":"will be graded on the boy curve."},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, this is\nfrom my childhood."},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"This is like, from\npeople your age."},"699":{"dur":4,"text":"Or one friend's daughter\nwas told by her teacher,"},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"you're too pretty\nto be good math."},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"And very recently I\nheard-- so I heard"},"708":{"dur":6,"text":"from one young woman who\nwalked into-- she wanted"},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"to be in the robotics club."},"717":{"dur":1,"text":"She walked in, it\nwas all guys, she"},"718":{"dur":1,"text":"turned around and walked out."},"719":{"dur":3,"text":"But three young women who\nwere in the robotics club"},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"in high school, and they were\npreparing for a competition."},"725":{"dur":1,"text":"The club was going to\nhost a competition."},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"And the adviser for\nthe robotics club"},"729":{"dur":1,"text":"said to the three\nyoung women, you"},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"can be in charge\nof refreshments."},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"So they just dropped the club."},"736":{"dur":3,"text":"They never told him like,\nyou shouldn't say that."},"740":{"dur":5,"text":"So this stuff was still going\non, and that really shocked me."},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think what's different\nis, there are few more women,"},"748":{"dur":5,"text":"they last a bit longer, there\nare few more organizations for"},"754":{"dur":1,"text":"or are support\ngroups and things,"},"755":{"dur":6,"text":"but I was really surprised\nhow little had changed."},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"For the third part\nof the book, I"},"764":{"dur":3,"text":"did look at the studies\nthat had been done"},"767":{"dur":1,"text":"on gender bias in the science."},"768":{"dur":2,"text":"And more and more\nof those studies"},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"are being done now, partly\nbecause of Larry Summers'"},"773":{"dur":0,"text":"remarks."},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"So again, I think\nhe inadvertently"},"777":{"dur":3,"text":"did us a real service, because a\nlot of people got mad and said,"},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"all right, he wants us to give\nthem the reasons for this."},"784":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's figure it out."},"785":{"dur":3,"text":"And some of the\nstudies we very recent,"},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"and are really very powerful."},"791":{"dur":2,"text":"So the one I quoted\nin the excerpt that"},"794":{"dur":2,"text":"appeared in the Times\nMagazine two years ago--"},"796":{"dur":3,"text":"it's in the book-- by\nJo Handelsman at Yale,"},"799":{"dur":1,"text":"which really shocked me."},"800":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's about implicit bias."},"803":{"dur":3,"text":"She ran the study at mostly\nresearch institutions,"},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"but one of the categories\nwas engineering."},"809":{"dur":3,"text":"So there was engineering,\nphysics, chemistry,"},"812":{"dur":1,"text":"I think math was the other one."},"813":{"dur":4,"text":"And what they did was just\nmock up job applications"},"818":{"dur":1,"text":"for an entry level position."},"819":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's sort of\nfor someone who's"},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"between undergrad and\nthinking of one day going on"},"824":{"dur":1,"text":"for a PH.D., and\nin the meantime,"},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"wants like, a lab manager job."},"828":{"dur":3,"text":"And so they're exactly\nthe same job application--"},"832":{"dur":3,"text":"the same cover letter,\nreferences, you know,"},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"grades, everything's the same."},"838":{"dur":2,"text":"But one says John on\nand one says Jennifer."},"841":{"dur":1,"text":"That's the only difference."},"843":{"dur":4,"text":"And if you see the bar graph\nfor the statistical difference,"},"848":{"dur":2,"text":"it's so significant-- it's\nnot like, some little sliver,"},"850":{"dur":6,"text":"it's huge-- that John was judged\nmore hireable, more competent,"},"857":{"dur":2,"text":"and more worthy\nof being mentored"},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"than Jennifer by a huge margin."},"862":{"dur":2,"text":"And if Jennifer was\ngoing to be hired,"},"865":{"dur":4,"text":"her salary was a good $4,000\nto $5,000 lower than John's."},"869":{"dur":1,"text":"And we're talking\nreally small salary."},"871":{"dur":3,"text":"So John would get\nlike $32,000 and she"},"874":{"dur":2,"text":"was going to get $28,000,\nor it's $26,000 and $30,000."},"876":{"dur":1,"text":"Something like that."},"878":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's huge, right?"},"879":{"dur":5,"text":"And what really shocked me\nwas that the degree of bias"},"884":{"dur":3,"text":"did not vary\naccording to gender."},"888":{"dur":2,"text":"So women who were going\nto hire a lab manager"},"891":{"dur":3,"text":"preferred John just\nas much as guys"},"894":{"dur":1,"text":"who were going to\nhire a lab manager."},"895":{"dur":2,"text":"And it didn't vary by age."},"898":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you were an assistant\nprofessor or a full professor,"},"900":{"dur":3,"text":"you were 30 or you were\n65, you were just as"},"904":{"dur":3,"text":"biased against Jennifer, except\nthat Jennifer was much more"},"907":{"dur":2,"text":"likely to be judged likable."},"909":{"dur":2,"text":"Like, who did you\nthink was more likable?"},"912":{"dur":0,"text":"Jennifer."},"913":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can see how insidious\nsome of these things are."},"915":{"dur":1,"text":"Because if you were\nJennifer, and you went in"},"917":{"dur":2,"text":"for the job interview,\nyou'd come out thinking,"},"920":{"dur":0,"text":"I got the job."},"921":{"dur":2,"text":"And you would even get\nwhy you didn't get it,"},"924":{"dur":2,"text":"because the people\nhiring you wouldn't"},"926":{"dur":3,"text":"get why you didn't get it."},"930":{"dur":2,"text":"So that I thought was shocking."},"932":{"dur":1,"text":"One study that's not\nin the book that I'll"},"934":{"dur":2,"text":"share with you that also\nshocked me-- so this one"},"936":{"dur":1,"text":"just came out,\nliterally, last week."},"937":{"dur":1,"text":"And it was done by,\nactually, a friend of mine"},"939":{"dur":3,"text":"from the old days,\nBob Sege, who's"},"942":{"dur":3,"text":"in Boston, that came out in\nthe Journal of American Medical"},"946":{"dur":2,"text":"So you tend to think, too,\nthat these problems aren't"},"949":{"dur":2,"text":"as bad, say, in biology,\nbecause those are now"},"952":{"dur":3,"text":"women fields, and people\nfields, or whatever."},"955":{"dur":2,"text":"So this was in\nbiomedical science."},"957":{"dur":4,"text":"And the study measured start\nup grants for first time hires."},"962":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you-- in academia\nyou get your first lab,"},"965":{"dur":2,"text":"you need money to set it\nup, because you haven't been"},"967":{"dur":1,"text":"able to get grants yet, right?"},"969":{"dur":3,"text":"So the money comes from the\ninstitution that hires you."},"972":{"dur":2,"text":"So the average\nfor women starting"},"974":{"dur":3,"text":"their lab-- their support\nmoney was $350,000."},"978":{"dur":1,"text":"Sounds like a lot, right?"},"979":{"dur":2,"text":"So you could imagine a young\nwoman getting hired going,"},"981":{"dur":3,"text":"wow, they hired me and\nthey gave me $350,000."},"984":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes, thank you
