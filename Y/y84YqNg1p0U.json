were three other\n14-year-olds and one other"},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"12-year-old that were planning\nto do the swim."},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"And so what we did is we only\nswam in the ocean so that our"},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"bodies would start to acclimate\nto the colder water"},"730":{"dur":1,"text":"temperature."},"732":{"dur":1,"text":"The pool temperature\nwas 76 degrees."},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"And we found that if we swam\nin the pool, we'd overheat."},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"We'd start sweating and\nturn bright red."},"740":{"dur":3,"text":"So by swimming only in the\nocean, that started our"},"743":{"dur":1,"text":"acclimatization process."},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"But we also did things\nlike during--"},"748":{"dur":1,"text":"it was summer and fall."},"749":{"dur":3,"text":"So I only trained with this\ngroup of swimmers"},"752":{"dur":1,"text":"for about six weeks."},"753":{"dur":1,"text":"They had been training\nfor a year."},"755":{"dur":2,"text":"But I had been training with\nDon Gambril, who was the US"},"758":{"dur":3,"text":"So I was sort of trying to\nacclimate very quickly."},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"And my

try to get my"},"772":{"dur":2,"text":"body used to a colder\ntemperature."},"774":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's what I did for the\nCatalina Channel swim."},"778":{"dur":2,"text":"The English Channel swim was\nsignificantly colder."},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"It was 56 degrees."},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"And so all winter long, I'd\nleave the windows open."},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"I'd wear very

lot."},"794":{"dur":3,"text":"But I basically, through\nthe years, did"},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"colder and longer swims."},"800":{"dur":5,"text":"So the Bering Strait swim was\nin 38 degree water for two"},"805":{"dur":1,"text":"hours and six minutes."},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"The swim in the Antarctic\nwas just 25"},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"minutes and 32 degrees."},"811":{"dur":2,"text":"I really

temperature there"},"821":{"dur":1,"text":"was 42 degrees."},"823":{"dur":4,"text":"So what I did is I tried to work\nout in a way that I swam"},"827":{"dur":5,"text":"slower to cool my body down\na little bit more."},"832":{"dur":3,"text":"But I also trained putting\nin my face in the water."},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"So that would cool my body\ndown a little faster too."},"839":{"dur":2,"text":"You lose 80% of heat\nthrough your head."},"841":{"dur":3,"text":"So I thought, OK, during\ntraining I'll get a little bit"},"845":{"dur":2,"text":"colder than I normally would."},"847":{"dur":2,"text":"And then when I went down to\nAntarctica, when I actually"},"850":{"dur":3,"text":"did the swim from the ship to\nthe shores of Antarctica, I"},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"swam head up like a\nwater polo player."},"856":{"dur":4,"text":"Because you lose 80% of heat\nthrough your head, you lose"},"860":{"dur":1,"text":"the heat really,\nreally quickly."},"861":{"dur":2,"text":"So I thought if I swam head up\nfor the majority of the swim,"},"864":{"dur":2,"text":"I'd be able to contain\nmore heat in my body."},"867":{"dur":2,"text":"I also did a few weird\nthings, but whatever."},"869":{"dur":2,"text":"Because you're doing things that\nhave never been done and"},"871":{"dur":1,"text":"you don't know how it's\ngoing to work."},"872":{"dur":2,"text":"So you're going to just try\na variety of things."},"875":{"dur":3,"text":"I always look at nature to\nsee what's possible."},"878":{"dur":3,"text":"And when you look at penguins,\nthere like this big, like the"},"882":{"dur":1,"text":"Gentoo penguins."},"883":{"dur":3,"text":"And they're like kind of rotund\nor cylinder shaped."},"887":{"dur":4,"text":"And their body is really amply\ncoated with body fat and it's"},"891":{"dur":1,"text":"really well distributed."},"893":{"dur":3,"text":"And then outside the layer\nof body fat are feathers."},"896":{"dur":4,"text":"So there's this air insulation\nthat exists between the body"},"901":{"dur":1,"text":"and the feathers."},"902":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's what really keeps\nthem warm is the air between"},"905":{"dur":1,"text":"the two, and their body fat."},"907":{"dur":3,"text":"So I figured what I'll do before\nI swim in Antarctica is"},"910":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll grow my hair really long."},"912":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'll wind it up and pile it\non top of my head and put"},"916":{"dur":0,"text":"it under my bathing cap."},"917":{"dur":1,"text":"And I won't squish\nout the air."},"918":{"dur":2,"text":"And when I swim, I'll swim\nhead up and maybe I can"},"921":{"dur":2,"text":"contain my body heat better."},"924":{"dur":5,"text":"There were other things that I\ndid to try to help me that"},"929":{"dur":2,"text":"again nobody had ever\ndone this before."},"931":{"dur":3,"text":"And I don't think anyone ever\nreally wanted to do it anyway."},"934":{"dur":3,"text":"So it was a really big\nstretch for me."},"938":{"dur":3,"text":"So I do know that one of the\nside effects of hypothermia is"},"942":{"dur":3,"text":"that you become dehydrated and\nthat also helps to contribute"},"946":{"dur":1,"text":"to becoming hypodermic."},"947":{"dur":3,"text":"So before my swim in Antarctica,\nI decided, OK, you"},"951":{"dur":3,"text":"need to make your body\nlike a thermos."},"954":{"dur":3,"text":"Because you've got basically\nyour body, your body fat, and"},"957":{"dur":0,"text":"then your skin."},"958":{"dur":3,"text":"And your skin will close down\nthe blood flow really well."},"961":{"dur":1,"text":"That's what it's been\ntrained to do."},"962":{"dur":2,"text":"And it'll close it

thought maybe if I can\nwarm up my core temperature"},"974":{"dur":3,"text":"before I start swimming, maybe\nthat will help me on the swim."},"978":{"dur":5,"text":"So what I did is I drank four\n8 ounces of really hot water"},"983":{"dur":3,"text":"to put into the thermos before\nI started the swim."},"987":{"dur":2,"text":"And then because of the research\nI've been doing, we"},"989":{"dur":3,"text":"wound up getting a pre-core\ntemperature before I swam."},"993":{"dur":3,"text":"My body temperature was up to\n102 before I started the swim."},"997":{"dur":2,"text":"And

to"},"1445":{"dur":2,"text":"go all the way now."},"1448":{"dur":4,"text":"And so it sort of like\nshifted everything."},"1452":{"dur":3,"text":"And the other part that was\nreally exciting was that

that."},"3192":{"dur":3,"text":"But usually what happens with\ncramps is that somebody has"},"3195":{"dur":3,"text":"either their electrolytes are\nout of balance and so maybe"},"3199":{"dur":3,"text":"you're aren't having enough\ncalcium, or sodium chloride,"},"3202":{"dur":0,"text":"or anything."},"3203":{"dur":3,"text":"Maybe you need to talk to your\ndoctor or

happens\nthough is your muscles fatigue"},"3215":{"dur":1,"text":"at a certain point."},"3216":{"dur":3,"text":"And so maybe you're not training\nhard enough, those"},"3220":{"dur":3,"text":"muscles in your feet, to prepare\nyou for the swim."},"3223":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe they're fatiguing and\nthat's causing the cramping."},"3225":{"dur":3,"text":"Or the other thing is you\nmay be kicking too

just balance."},"3250":{"dur":2,"text":"So you might try backing off\non you kick a little bit."},"3253":{"dur":2,"text":"So then you can use your oxygen\nfor your arms and pull"},"3255":{"dur":1,"text":"more strongly with your\narms and see if that"},"3257":{"dur":1,"text":"increases your speed."},"3259":{"dur":2,"text":"And then you don't get the\ncramps in your

is to be able\nto breathe on both sides."},"3349":{"dur":2,"text":"Because if you can breathe on\nboth sides, then you can see"},"3351":{"dur":0,"text":"on both sides."},"3352":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can swim in a\nmore balanced way."},"3355":{"dur":4,"text":"But you also can see what's\naround you for safety."},"3359":{"dur":3,"text":"And so there might be a jet\nskier coming off this
