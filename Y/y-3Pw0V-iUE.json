maintain such\ntight control over such"},"98":{"dur":2,"text":"a long period of time?"},"101":{"dur":2,"text":"The North Korean\ngovernment, more"},"103":{"dur":1,"text":"than any other\nauthoritarian

maintains control\nby maintaining a monopoly"},"141":{"dur":1,"text":"as a single source of\ninformation and ideas"},"143":{"dur":2,"text":"inside of that country."},"145":{"dur":4,"text":"So, for

people,"},"193":{"dur":2,"text":"in a form of extreme\nindoctrination."},"196":{"dur":2,"text":"And so because of this, this is\nhow the North Korean government"},"198":{"dur":5,"text":"has been able to control North\nKorean society for so long."},"204":{"dur":4,"text":"In addition, there is\na zero tolerance policy"},"208":{"dur":2,"text":"for any form of\npolitical

the situation\nseem impossible,"},"296":{"dur":2,"text":"but many changes have\nactually been happening"},"298":{"dur":3,"text":"over the last two decades\nthat point to social changes"},"302":{"dur":1,"text":"and trends that\ncan give us hope."},"303":{"dur":1,"text":"That there is in fact\nchange happening,"},"305":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's coming from\na grassroots level,"},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's being driven by\nthe North Korean people."},"309":{"dur":2,"text":"But in order to understand\nhow these changes came about,"},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"we have to go back to a very\ntragic time in North Korea's"},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"history in the '90s, when\nNorth Korea experienced"},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"a severe famine-- one of the\nworst of the 20th century--"},"319":{"dur":2,"text":"where it's estimated that up to\na million North Koreans starved"},"322":{"dur":1,"text":"to death in that country."},"324":{"dur":1,"text":"One of those people\nbeing Joseph's father,"},"325":{"dur":3,"text":"and you'll hear more\nabout his story today."},"329":{"dur":4,"text":"But out of this tragedy\nemerged an opportunity."},"333":{"dur":2,"text":"And what you saw\nwas the emergence"},"335":{"dur":1,"text":"of grassroots markets."},"337":{"dur":2,"text":"People decided, as a\nsurvival mechanism,"},"339":{"dur":2,"text":"to take matters into\ntheir own hands."},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"And they were able to go\nout and to begin to trade"},"345":{"dur":1,"text":"and to get the\ngoods and the things"},"346":{"dur":1,"text":"that they needed for\nthemselves and for others"},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"that the government could no\nlonger provide for themselves--"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"that the government could\nno longer provide for them,"},"353":{"dur":1,"text":"or that they wouldn't\nprovide for them."},"355":{"dur":1,"text":"So what we saw\nhappening was actually,"},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"with this grassroots\nmarketization"},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"and the proliferation\nof these markets,"},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"was actually North Korean\npeople taking matters"},"363":{"dur":1,"text":"into their own hands."},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"And before the 1990s, before\nthis famine, what you saw"},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"was that the state was central\nto the North Korean people."},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"It provided everything to\nthe people-- information,"},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"technology, food, ideology."},"374":{"dur":3,"text":"And then what happened was\nthis shift after the '90s,"},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"after the proliferation\nof these markets,"},"379":{"dur":3,"text":"and people being empowered\nthrough these markets instead"},"382":{"dur":3,"text":"to be able to then access the\nthings that they needed apart"},"385":{"dur":1,"text":"from the state."},"387":{"dur":1,"text":"The shift is very significant."},"388":{"dur":1,"text":"Because these markets\nbecame a catalyst"},"390":{"dur":1,"text":"for North Korean\npeople, actually,"},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"in order to now utilize\nthe markets as also"},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"a grounds for which they\ncould then exchange ideas,"},"397":{"dur":3,"text":"and information, and even\ntechnologies that were actually"},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"helping to accelerate\nthe erosion of ideology"},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"of the state."},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"So the markets are\nvery important-- are"},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"very important in terms\nof some of these changes"},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"in social trends that we see\nemerging over the last two"},"412":{"dur":0,"text":"decades."},"415":{"dur":3,"text":"So some of these major trends\nthat we recognize are here."},"419":{"dur":1,"text":"The loss of control of\nthe economy and the rise"},"421":{"dur":0,"text":"of capitalism."},"422":{"dur":3,"text":"North Korea today is\nessentially a market economy."},"425":{"dur":1,"text":"Many people are\nnot aware of that."},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"The second is the weakening\nof North Korea's information"},"429":{"dur":3,"text":"blockade and the introduction of\nunofficial foreign information."},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"Again, the markets\nbecame a place"},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"where foreign information\nand illegal foreign media"},"437":{"dur":3,"text":"were coming in through devices\nand through technologies"},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"like USBs and DVDs that\npeople were smuggling,"},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"and brokers are smuggling in\nand that are being traded,"},"445":{"dur":3,"text":"and are being viewed and\nshared across the country."},"448":{"dur":1,"text":"The third is\nwidespread corruption."},"450":{"dur":1,"text":"And this corruption\nis important,"},"451":{"dur":3,"text":"because it enables all of\nthese things to happen."},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"Fourth is the emergence of human\nnetworks outside of government"},"458":{"dur":3,"text":"controlled space and\nnormalized shared disobedience."},"461":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is very\nimportant, also,"},"462":{"dur":1,"text":"because there is\nno civil society"},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"in North Korea--\nintentionally, as a way"},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"in which the government has\nset up the system within."},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"But as a result\nof the markets, it"},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"gave an opportunity,\na platform, for people"},"474":{"dur":1,"text":"to be able to connect\nwith each other"},"475":{"dur":1,"text":"and to develop bonds of trust."},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is also very important."},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"Fifth is the rise of the\nJangmadang generation."},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the equivalent of\nNorth Korean millennials."},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"And they are a\nwhole new generation"},"487":{"dur":1,"text":"of young people in\nthis country that"},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"have a very different\nrelationship"},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"with the government and the\nstate than their parents'"},"493":{"dur":0,"text":"generation."},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"Because they grew up in\na time where they never"},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"relied on the state and never\nreceived anything from them."},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"And the last is the\nimpact of defectors"},"502":{"dur":1,"text":"who have resettled\nin South Korea"},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"but maintain contact with\ntheir home communities."},"505":{"dur":1,"text":"So since I don't\nhave time to expound"},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"on all of these,\nwhat I want to do"},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"is actually talk primarily\nabout number six,"},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"the impact of defectors."},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"Because this is the\nkey area of work"},"513":{"dur":1,"text":"that our organization does."},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"So as a result of many of these\nchallenges that North Korean"},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"people face, in addition\nto the famine that"},"521":{"dur":1,"text":"happened in the '90s,\nwe began to really see"},"523":{"dur":3,"text":"a flow of North Koreans\nleaving that country in the mid"},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"to late '90s."},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"And they've continued\nto come out since then."},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"This here outlines the path\nthat North Korean refugees"},"533":{"dur":1,"text":"will take in their escape."},"535":{"dur":3,"text":"And you'll see it's a little bit\ncrazy, because right below them"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"is South Korea, their\nfinal destination-- most"},"540":{"dur":1,"text":"of their final destinations."},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"But because of the DMZ, one\nof the most heavily fortified"},"544":{"dur":1,"text":"borders in the\nworld, they're not"},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"able to cross\nthrough that border."},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"So instead, they escape\ninto neighboring China"},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"and then try to\nmake their way out"},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"through this sort of modern\nday Underground Railroad,"},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"which is about 3,500\nmiles long and takes them"},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"from the border there\nof China and North Korea"},"559":{"dur":1,"text":"all the way to Southeast Asia."},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"That's longer than the\ndistance of New York and LA."},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"And so this is the\nunderground route"},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"that many North\nKoreans have taken."},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"In fact, tens of\nthousands of them"},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"have taken over the\nlast decade and a half."},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"And so what we see\nhere, actually,"},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"is that once they\nget into China,"},"576":{"dur":1,"text":"this is not an easy route."},"577":{"dur":1,"text":"This is not an easy journey."},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"The Chinese government\ndoes not recognize"},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"North Koreans as refugees."},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"Instead, they claim that\nthey are economic migrants"},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"and that they have\nthe right to be"},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"able to find them, arrest\nthem, and forcibly send them"},"591":{"dur":1,"text":"back to North Korea."},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"And if North Koreans\nhave illegally"},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"left that country, as\nalmost all of these refugees"},"597":{"dur":3,"text":"have, and they are forcibly\nsent back, many of them"},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"could face severe punishment\nupon being sent back"},"603":{"dur":1,"text":"into North Korea."},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"And so the situation for them\nin China is extremely dangerous."},"607":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is really where\norganizations like ours,"},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"other missionaries,\nNGOs, and even"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"brokers in the underground,\nare able to step in"},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"and to help North Koreans\nwho are there, who are"},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"at high risk of exploitation."},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, at the peak of\nwhen refugees were leaving"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"that country in the\nearly 2000s, you"},"624":{"dur":3,"text":"saw thousands leaving every year\nand making it to South Korea."},"627":{"dur":4,"text":"At that time, it was\nestimated that 70% to 80%"},"632":{"dur":3,"text":"of female North Korean refugees\nwere being trafficked or sold"},"636":{"dur":3,"text":"because of how at risk they\nwere, at risk of exploitation."},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"They had no one to protect\nthem in that country."},"642":{"dur":3,"text":"Today, the paths in which\npeople are coming through"},"645":{"dur":1,"text":"have become a lot\nmore established."},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"There are more organizations,\nand there are groups,"},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"and there are family members\nwho have already made it"},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"out that are able to facilitate\nfor their way to come out"},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"quicker, sooner faster, safer."},"657":{"dur":1,"text":"And there are also more\npeople, like you guys,"},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"that are supporting those\nefforts on the backend in order"},"661":{"dur":4,"text":"to help more people to make it\nout safely and more quickly."},"666":{"dur":4,"text":"So one of the most\nimportant reasons"},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"why we work with\nNorth Korean refugees"},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"is not only because of the\nhumanitarian imperative"},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"and the opportunity that\nwe have to help them,"},"678":{"dur":3,"text":"but also because of the fact\nthat North Korean refugees are"},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"playing one of the most\nimportant roles on this issue."},"684":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's a unique role that only\nthey can play, that none of us"},"687":{"dur":0,"text":"can play."},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's because, of the\n30,000 North Koreans that"},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"have resettled in\nSouth Korea today,"},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"it's estimated that\nmore than 50% of them"},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"have been able to reestablish\ncontact with their family"},"697":{"dur":1,"text":"members inside of that country."},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"And they do so through\nillicit Chinese cell"},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"phones that have been\nsmuggled into the border."},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's through\nthat that they're"},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"able to communicate with\ntheir family members,"},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"sharing and sending information\nin and out of that country"},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"through these relationships."},"712":{"dur":3,"text":"But secondary is also\nthe flow of money."},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"This community of\nNorth Korean defectors"},"717":{"dur":5,"text":"sends, on average, anywhere\nfrom about $15 million a year--"},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"$15 million a year\nback into that country"},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"to their family members."},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"And that money is crucial in\naccelerating these changes"},"730":{"dur":1,"text":"that we believe are\nhappening-- that we"},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"know are happening, these\nvery important social changes."},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"It's accelerating this\ngrassroots marketization."},"737":{"dur":1,"text":"It's providing for\ntheir family members"},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"to enable them to buy the goods\nand the things that they need."},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's also enabling\ntheir families"},"744":{"dur":1,"text":"to invest in their\nown market activities"},"746":{"dur":1,"text":"to protect themselves."},"747":{"dur":1,"text":"It's increasing their\nfamily's ability"},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"for more human security."},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"And this map here, the\nhot spots of change,"},"753":{"dur":1,"text":"are areas where\nwe believe change"},"755":{"dur":1,"text":"is happening at a faster rate."},"757":{"dur":2,"text":"And a large part of that\nbeing because of the fact"},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"that these are key areas where\ndefectors have come from,"},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"and where money and\ninformation is flowing back"},"764":{"dur":1,"text":"into that country."},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"So we have an\nopportunity to work"},"768":{"dur":2,"text":"with more North Korean\ndefectors and refugees,"},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"helping them not\nonly in their escape,"},"772":{"dur":1,"text":"but empowering them\nin their resettlement."},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"The more successful\nthey can become,"},"776":{"dur":2,"text":"the more opportunities\nthat they have in order"},"779":{"dur":1,"text":"to be agents of\nchange on this issue."},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"And we truly believe\nthat North Korea"},"783":{"dur":3,"text":"is one of the most difficult\nchallenges facing humanity"},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"today, but that the\nNorth Korean people"},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"are the best solution for that."},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"And, you know, I think one of\nthe opportunities we have here"},"794":{"dur":3,"text":"today is to listen to\nthe story of Joseph Kim."},"798":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's such an honor to have\nhim here to share his story."},"802":{"dur":1,"text":"If you're not familiar\nwith his story,"},"803":{"dur":1,"text":"I think you'll be very touched."},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"And I've had a chance to\nknow Joseph since 2007,"},"809":{"dur":1,"text":"when he first arrived\nhere in the United States"},"811":{"dur":4,"text":"as a refugee-- as a URM, a\nnon-accompanied refugee minor."},"815":{"dur":1,"text":"And it was really\nthrough meeting"},"817":{"dur":3,"text":"Joseph that really brought me\neven further into this issue."},"820":{"dur":1,"text":"Because as you hear\nJoseph speak you'll"},"822":{"dur":3,"text":"get to know that, despite\nthe incredible

good."},"880":{"dur":1,"text":"So what I wanted\nto do was actually"},"881":{"dur":2,"text":"start off with a few questions."},"884":{"dur":2,"text":"Just because I'm sure there are\nquestions that all of you have,"},"887":{"dur":1,"text":"so that Joseph can\nshare his story."},"888":{"dur":1,"text":"And then we'll make\nsure that we have"},"889":{"dur":3,"text":"some time at the end to open\nit

you"},"2890":{"dur":2,"text":"didn't know."},"2892":{"dur":3,"text":"Now I think about it, it's\nvery obvious statement."},"2896":{"dur":2,"text":"But I think it has also\nvery profound

Korea."},"2969":{"dur":2,"text":"And everybody say,\nSouth or North?"},"2972":{"dur":3,"text":"So I can assume\nthat many people are"},"2975":{"dur":1,"text":"going to be surprised\nif you say--"},"2977":{"dur":1,"text":"it's for Joseph,\nsorry-- when you"},"2978":{"dur":1,"text":"say you're from\nNorth Korea, they"},"2980":{"dur":1,"text":"will have a lot of questions."},"2981":{"dur":2,"text":"And they will have\nlike reaction to you."},"2983":{"dur":2,"text":"I wonder-- I'm curious to\nknow what kind of reaction"},"2986":{"dur":4,"text":"you get when you tell people\nthat you're from North Korea."},"2990":{"dur":3,"text":"JOSEPH KIM: So I personally\nhave not been to South Korea,"},"2994":{"dur":5,"text":"so I don't know what\nthe reaction would"},"2999":{"dur":2,"text":"be if I was in South Korea."},"3002":{"dur":6,"text":"But I think in America, whenever\nI meet South Korean friends"},"3008":{"dur":6,"text":"or people from South\nKorea, they are very open."},"3015":{"dur":6,"text":"They're very curious\nabout lot of things."},"3021":{"dur":2,"text":"But there is--\nthere was one time"},"3023":{"dur":5,"text":"that I was in South Africa\nfor another conference."},"3029":{"dur":2,"text":"It was called [INAUDIBLE]."},"3031":{"dur":6,"text":"And basically, 192\ncountries send young leaders"},"3037":{"dur":1,"text":"from

like, no way."},"3060":{"dur":2,"text":"They're like, well,\nhow can you be here?"},"3063":{"dur":4,"text":"And then we talked a\nlittle bit, but then I"},"3067":{"dur":3,"text":"think the conversation\njust dropped,"},"3071":{"dur":5,"text":"because we didn't really know\nwhat to talk about afterward."},"3076":{"dur":6,"text":"But I think we started-- instead\nof talking about politics,"},"3083":{"dur":4,"text":"or talking complicated matters,\nwe started asking like, oh,"},"3087":{"dur":2,"text":"how long did your\nflight take you to here,"},"3090":{"dur":1,"text":"or what was it like?"},"3091":{"dur":4,"text":"And we started talking about\nvery basic conversations."},"3096":{"dur":9,"text":"And during the four days of our\nconference, we became so close."},"3105":{"dur":4,"text":"We would share meals\nand eat meals together."},"3110":{"dur":5,"text":"And I think that was the\nclosest experience that I have,"},"3115":{"dur":6,"text":"or the reactionary that I--\nso from South Korean people."},"3121":{"dur":7,"text":"And in terms of status, I'm\nsorry, I kind of lost track."},"3129":{"dur":1,"text":"HANNAH SONG: I'll answer that."},"3130":{"dur":2,"text":"So the status, then, for\nNorth Koreans in China"},"3133":{"dur":1,"text":"is they're illegally there."},"3134":{"dur":1,"text":"So the Chinese\ngovernment, because they"},"3136":{"dur":2,"text":"don't recognize them, refuses\nto acknowledge them as refugees."},"3139":{"dur":2,"text":"But they are technically\nunder the UN definition"},"3141":{"dur":3,"text":"of

country."},"3149":{"dur":2,"text":"Meaning because of the\nrisk they would be at"},"3151":{"dur":2,"text":"if they were to be repatriated."},"3153":{"dur":2,"text":"And so they do qualify\nunder that definition."},"3156":{"dur":1,"text":"And so the\ninternational community"},"3158":{"dur":3,"text":"recognizes them as refugees\nonce they've left North Korea."},"3161":{"dur":1,"text":"The Chinese government does not."},"3163":{"dur":1,"text":"And so that's one\nof the reasons why"},"3165":{"dur":2,"text":"NGOs like ours have to\nplay this role in-between."},"3167":{"dur":2,"text":"Because governments are very\nlimited in terms of what"},"3169":{"dur":3,"text":"they can actually do to help\nNorth Korean refugees in China."},"3172":{"dur":2,"text":"As are agencies like\nthe UNHCR, in fact."},"3175":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, they're\nvery limited in terms"},"3176":{"dur":2,"text":"of how they can actually\nhelp North Koreans."},"3178":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's one of the main\nreasons why we bring them out"},"3180":{"dur":1,"text":"through to Southeast Asia."},"3181":{"dur":2,"text":"And in Southeast Asia,\nthere are countries there"},"3183":{"dur":1,"text":"where they are\nrecognized, or where"},"3185":{"dur":1,"text":"they do have an\nopportunity, then,"},"3186":{"dur":2,"text":"to apply for refugee\nstatus or for resettlement"},"3189":{"dur":2,"text":"in countries like South\nKorea and the United States."},"3191":{"dur":2,"text":"South Korea will\nessentially, you know,"},"3194":{"dur":1,"text":"see them as South\nKorean citizens."},"3195":{"dur":2,"text":"And so they do receive that\ncitizenship pretty quickly"},"3198":{"dur":1,"text":"upon resettling."},"3199":{"dur":2,"text":"Coming to the US, for\nexample, or other countries,"},"3202":{"dur":2,"text":"they come as refugees\nand then have"},"3204":{"dur":1,"text":"to undergo the process\nof getting a green card"},"3206":{"dur":3,"text":"and then can apply for\ncitizenship, as well."},"3209":{"dur":2,"text":"One quick point on kind of what\nyou had mentioned before, too."},"3212":{"dur":2,"text":"And being from South Korea,\nyou're probably also

not warmly"},"3222":{"dur":1,"text":"received in South\nKorean society."},"3223":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's one of the\nbiggest challenges"},"3226":{"dur":1,"text":"that a lot of North\nKoreans do face there,"},"3227":{"dur":2,"text":"because of this type of\ndiscrimination they can face."},"3230":{"dur":2,"text":"But I think a lot of it really\njust comes from a challenge"},"3233":{"dur":2,"text":"with the narrative in\nSouth Korea on North Korea."},"3235":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think that's a real\nopportunity, in terms"},"3237":{"dur":3,"text":"of us trying

things"},"3246":{"dur":1,"text":"is some of the North Koreans\nwe work with in South Korea"},"3248":{"dur":1,"text":"actually, when they\nask where they're from,"},"3250":{"dur":3,"text":"will lie and
