level,"},"16":{"dur":2,"text":"there are clearly some athletes \nwho always seem to get it right."},"19":{"dur":1,"text":"For example, Usain Bolt:"},"21":{"dur":3,"text":"Olympic 100m, 200m champion, twice over,"},"24":{"dur":3,"text":"in the 2008 Beijing Olympics \nand in the London Olympics."},"27":{"dur":3,"text":"Michael Phelps:\nthe most bemedaled Olympian of all time."},"31":{"dur":2,"text":"These are athletes \nwho clearly get it right,"},"33":{"dur":3,"text":"both psychologically \nand physiologically all of the time."},"38":{"dur":4,"text":"It is also interesting to note that \nthey have contrasting approaches."},"42":{"dur":2,"text":"Usain Bolt, with all his comedy antics,"},"45":{"dur":2,"text":"prior to his event, \nwhen he is on the start line."},"48":{"dur":2,"text":"We've all seen this.\n(Laughter)"},"51":{"dur":3,"text":"Michael Phelps, \nhowever, a much different approach."},"54":{"dur":2,"text":"He sits down,\nhe is listening to music,"},"57":{"dur":3,"text":"he has much more \ncerebral, contemplative approach"},"61":{"dur":1,"text":"towards his event."},"62":{"dur":2,"text":"But it's both very effective."},"66":{"dur":4,"text":"Sport psychology may play a part\nin their preparation for their events,"},"70":{"dur":2,"text":"and maybe a reason \nwhy they're successful."},"74":{"dur":1,"text":"What happens when things go wrong?"},"76":{"dur":1,"text":"Here's another example."},"78":{"dur":4,"text":"In the 2012 Olympics in London\nin the soccer final,"},"82":{"dur":2,"text":"there were two finalists, \nBrazil and Mexico."},"85":{"dur":2,"text":"Brazil were the undoubted favorites."},"87":{"dur":1,"text":"They were expected to win."},"89":{"dur":2,"text":"They were the reigning Olympic champions."},"91":{"dur":1,"text":"They were extremely skilled,"},"92":{"dur":1,"text":"on paper, they were the best team."},"94":{"dur":2,"text":"Mexico had made it to the final\nplaying well,"},"97":{"dur":2,"text":"but they were unfancied."},"99":{"dur":4,"text":"In the final,\nMexico went at Brazil"},"104":{"dur":3,"text":"in an incredible display\nof attacking football."},"107":{"dur":1,"text":"It was incredibly impressive to watch."},"109":{"dur":1,"text":"And if you watched \nthe Brazilian players,"},"111":{"dur":1,"text":"their heads dropped."},"112":{"dur":2,"text":"They seemed slightly defeated."},"114":{"dur":1,"text":"They could not understand"},"115":{"dur":2,"text":"why they were not performing \nquite as well as they were."},"117":{"dur":1,"text":"Perhaps they were complacent."},"119":{"dur":3,"text":"Perhaps they'd expected too much."},"123":{"dur":1,"text":"Perhaps they were overconfident."},"125":{"dur":1,"text":"The Mexicans had nothing to lose,"},"127":{"dur":1,"text":"they attacked with fervor"},"128":{"dur":1,"text":"and they won the Olympic title,"},"130":{"dur":3,"text":"they were the Olympic champions\nover the fancy favorites."},"134":{"dur":4,"text":"Perhaps sport psychology \ncan explain why fancied champions"},"138":{"dur":2,"text":"may be over-confident"},"140":{"dur":2,"text":"and may fail\nwhen they're expected to win,"},"143":{"dur":2,"text":"and perhaps why underdogs\ntake on the best"},"146":{"dur":3,"text":"and win\ndespite all the odds."},"150":{"dur":1,"text":"Take another example."},"151":{"dur":1,"text":"James Magnussen:"},"153":{"dur":2,"text":"a man with seemingly \nunshakable self-confidence."},"155":{"dur":4,"text":"He said he was going to win \nthe 100m-sprint final in the pool"},"160":{"dur":2,"text":"at the London Olympics."},"162":{"dur":1,"text":"He was extremely confident."},"164":{"dur":1,"text":"But in that race,"},"165":{"dur":3,"text":"he was out-touched\nin the line by Nathan Adrian,"},"169":{"dur":2,"text":"by 1&#x2F;100 of a second."},"171":{"dur":1,"text":"And that was devastating for him,"},"173":{"dur":3,"text":"you could see his body language after,\nhe was destroyed."},"176":{"dur":2,"text":"Perhaps he was over-confident."},"178":{"dur":3,"text":"Perhaps though, \nhis obvious confidence"},"181":{"dur":3,"text":"in the events leading up \nto the actual final."},"185":{"dur":5,"text":"Perhaps his confidence belied\nan undelying self low confidence."},"190":{"dur":2,"text":"Perhaps he was not \nvery confident inside"},"193":{"dur":3,"text":"when he should have been\nsupremely confident of his abilities"},"197":{"dur":3,"text":"because he was\nthe world leader in the event."},"200":{"dur":2,"text":"So perhaps psychology \nmay have played a part,"},"203":{"dur":2,"text":"but in particular, \nit may help"},"205":{"dur":3,"text":"when overcoming such a devastating defeat\nfor the next event."},"210":{"dur":3,"text":"Another very good example:\nRoy McAvoy."},"213":{"dur":3,"text":"In the 2011 Augusta masters, \nhe was expected to win,"},"217":{"dur":2,"text":"he was amongst the favorites certainly,"},"219":{"dur":1,"text":"and he's an extremely talented golfer."},"221":{"dur":4,"text":"In fact, he is the one player\nthat all the people on the tour,"},"225":{"dur":2,"text":"all the golfers on the tour,\nthe PGA tour,"},"227":{"dur":1,"text":"fear the most."},"229":{"dur":0,"text":"And yet on the day,"},"230":{"dur":3,"text":"when he was leading,\non the final day of the event"},"233":{"dur":1,"text":"he was leading by four shots."},"235":{"dur":2,"text":"He'd played superbly\non the previous three days."},"237":{"dur":3,"text":"He experienced \na catastrophic drop in his performance."},"241":{"dur":1,"text":"He shot a round of 80,"},"243":{"dur":2,"text":"and this is something \nthat professional golfers"},"245":{"dur":3,"text":"can do in their sleep,\ncertainly very easily,"},"249":{"dur":4,"text":"because they frequently shoot\nrounds of 70 or below"},"253":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's a good shot."},"255":{"dur":2,"text":"So 80 was a catastrophic failure,"},"257":{"dur":2,"text":"and he ended up tying for fifteenth place."},"261":{"dur":2,"text":"So you'd think that \nthat sort of devastating performance"},"263":{"dur":2,"text":"may have impacted on his mind."},"266":{"dur":4,"text":"However, only eight weeks later,\nhe won the U.S open,"},"270":{"dur":3,"text":"and there was no sign \nof the lack of confidence"},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"and the fact that the pressure \nhad got to him,"},"275":{"dur":3,"text":"that was displayed \nwhen he was in Augusta."},"278":{"dur":1,"text":"So it seemed that\nhe picked up the pieces."},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"And what is it that made him do so?"},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"Sport psychology \nmay indeed have the answers."},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"So, elite athletes, coaches,"},"288":{"dur":1,"text":"and the people who surround athletes,"},"290":{"dur":2,"text":"know very well the importance \nof sport psychology,"},"292":{"dur":1,"text":"and they're beginning to embrace it."},"294":{"dur":2,"text":"Sport psychologists are often included"},"296":{"dur":2,"text":"in the teams \nthat surround athletes nowadays."},"300":{"dur":1,"text":"What is sport psychology?"},"301":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, it is the science, \nstudy and practice"},"306":{"dur":2,"text":"of mental preparation for sport."},"309":{"dur":2,"text":"It involves identifying \nthe techniques and strategies"},"312":{"dur":1,"text":"that athletes can take and use,"},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"so they perform on their most optimum."},"317":{"dur":3,"text":"It also helps athletes deal \nwith come back, with setbacks"},"320":{"dur":3,"text":"and help them to come back\nfrom devastating defeats."},"324":{"dur":4,"text":"Such as those by James Magnussen\nor Roy McAvoy."},"328":{"dur":3,"text":"So we just begin to unpack\nsome of these strategies"},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"that sport psychologists talk about."},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"So looking inside of the mind of a winner,"},"336":{"dur":3,"text":"what factors are linked\nto success in sport?"},"339":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, clearly an athlete\nhas to be motivated."},"342":{"dur":5,"text":"Often goals that athletes set, \ndescribe or..."},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"will demonstrate \nhow much effort"},"350":{"dur":3,"text":"and how much will they have to win\nin their event."},"353":{"dur":2,"text":"But sometimes motivation\nis not enough."},"356":{"dur":1,"text":"An athlete has to be confident,"},"358":{"dur":4,"text":"and confidence seems to be ubiquitous\namongst high-performing performers."},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a number of strategies\nthat athletes can use"},"365":{"dur":2,"text":"to boost their confidence."},"367":{"dur":3,"text":"Another important factor\nis knowledge of the sport."},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"So basically, \nknowing your sport inside out,"},"373":{"dur":1,"text":"but also knowing the opposition."},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"What are their strengths and weaknesses?"},"377":{"dur":3,"text":"One of the phrases coined\nby Clive Woodward,"},"381":{"dur":2,"text":"who was the England coach"},"384":{"dur":4,"text":"at the time they won \nthe Rugby World Cup in 2003."},"388":{"dur":1,"text":"One of the phrases he coined, was,"},"390":{"dur":4,"text":"\"Total rugby, leaving no stone unturned\nwhen it comes to performance.\""},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"He was very famous for developing \ndossiers on the opposition."},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"Knowing their strengths, \nknowing their weaknesses"},"403":{"dur":3,"text":"and where he could attack them\nand how he could tactically win them."},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's clearly important \nin sports these days."},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"So, using psychology \nto understand the opposition"},"412":{"dur":1,"text":"as well as yourself."},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"Athletes are also \nvery good at using routines,"},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"getting themselves \nin the right frame of mind."},"417":{"dur":2,"text":"We'll look at that \nin a few moments time."},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"Athletes are also good \nat handling pressure."},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"If you look at Usain Bolt\nor Michael Phelps,"},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"they are cases in point."},"426":{"dur":3,"text":"And anxiety management \nis clearly an important aspect"},"429":{"dur":3,"text":"of an athlete's arsenal of strategies"},"432":{"dur":2,"text":"to get them \nin the right frame of mind"},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"so that they can perform at their best."},"438":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's look at some \nof these strategies in detail."},"441":{"dur":4,"text":"Motivation is clearly very important,\nand how do you get athlete motivated?"},"445":{"dur":3,"text":"The most important things\nare the goals that they set."},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"The goals that they set \nwill determine how much drive,"},"451":{"dur":1,"text":"how much effort,"},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"how much will they have to perform well."},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"But often a goal of winning\nis not enough."},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"Sometimes, oh, most times,"},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"it is important that an athlete \nhas a number of sub-goals"},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"which are related \nto their performance."},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"So things like personal bests,"},"467":{"dur":4,"text":"that drive them \nboth in training and in competition."},"471":{"dur":3,"text":"It's important that these goals\nconform to certain features."},"474":{"dur":3,"text":"And scientists,\npsychologists and practitioners"},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"always refer to this SMART- acronym."},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's because, \nhaving goals that are realistic,"},"483":{"dur":3,"text":"relevant, specific,\nmeasurable and so forth,"},"486":{"dur":3,"text":"are really important when it comes\nto getting an athlete motivated."},"490":{"dur":3,"text":"As I said earlier, \nmotivation is not enough."},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"It is important \nthat an athlete is confident,"},"496":{"dur":1,"text":"and there are number of ways"},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"you can boost\nan athlete's self-confidence."},"500":{"dur":1,"text":"Experience."},"501":{"dur":1,"text":"Reminding an athlete\nof their experience"},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"is extremely important."},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"Modeling.\nI don't mean catwalk-modeling here,"},"506":{"dur":1,"text":"modeling is also an important aspect,"},"508":{"dur":3,"text":"because that enables an athlete\nto have a model"},"512":{"dur":3,"text":"or blueprint if you like \nof the optimum performance."},"516":{"dur":3,"text":"Imagery and self-talk are parts of that\nand we'll get on to those in a moment."},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"Feedback is clearly important as well."},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"Positive feedback\nfrom the athlete's coaches."},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"Imagery is a mental rehearsal"},"526":{"dur":3,"text":"and it is a strategy \nthat many athletes use."},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"And here are the kinds of things\nthat an athlete"},"532":{"dur":3,"text":"or a coach will go through,\nwhen they're rehearsing their performance."},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"It is almost like \na video of their performance."},"538":{"dur":1,"text":"They will also use prompts,"},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"but they also visualize \nany contingency that arise."},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"For example, any barriers \nor problems or difficulties"},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"that arise during the course\nof their competition."},"550":{"dur":3,"text":"Here's an example\nof these kinds of strategies in action."},"553":{"dur":1,"text":"This is Blanka Vla\u0161i\u0107:"},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"she was a former world champion,\nhigh jumper,"},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"and YWF athlete of the year."},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"And she was very famous for going through \nthe same performance routine"},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"prior to a competition."},"565":{"dur":4,"text":"She would close her eyes,\nvisualize a successful jump."},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"She would clap her hands rhythmically,"},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"and use the audience\nto get the audience on board"},"574":{"dur":3,"text":"and that would both boost her motivation\nand her confidence,"},"578":{"dur":4,"text":"and then she would practice some moves \nshortly before executing her jump."},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"Self-talk is another strategy\nthat athletes use."},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"It's an extremely important strategy"},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"because it enables athletes\nto go through in their mind"},"590":{"dur":3,"text":"and use mantras \nto try to boost their motivation,"},"594":{"dur":3,"text":"but also to try to manage \nthe competition and the situation."},"597":{"dur":1,"text":"For example,"},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"the situation where the pressure\nis on and they are highly anxious."},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"So, self-talk might have\nmotivational components,"},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"but it also might help athletes\nfocus on important things"},"608":{"dur":1,"text":"that are relevant to performance,"},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"so-called cues,\nand also might have a calming effect."},"612":{"dur":3,"text":"Things like breathe and relax."},"617":{"dur":4,"text":"Anxiety management is an important aspect \nof sport performance."},"621":{"dur":1,"text":"Clearly at the Olympic Game"},"622":{"dur":3,"text":"the World Championships \nat the highest level,"},"625":{"dur":1,"text":"athletes are going to be under pressure"},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"and they need to be able \nto cope with that pressure."},"629":{"dur":1,"text":"Sometimes being too anxious"},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"can actually undermine\nan athlete performance."},"634":{"dur":1,"text":"It can be sub-optimal."},"636":{"dur":3,"text":"So relaxation techniques \nare extremely important in this regard,"},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"and psychologists will work with athletes \nto try and help them to relax."},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"So it might involve\nthings like breathing,"},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"stretching,\nrelaxing the muscles,"},"647":{"dur":3,"text":"they'll also use things\nlike music and meditation."},"650":{"dur":1,"text":"Michael Phelps is a good example,"},"651":{"dur":3,"text":"he listens to music right up \nto the few minutes before is an event,"},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"and that music will get him \nto the right frame of mind"},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"for that event."},"659":{"dur":3,"text":"It will help him to relax \nbut it will also motivate him."},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"Here's a good example \nof somebody using those techniques"},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"to the greatest extent."},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"This is Yelena Isinbayeva:"},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"double Olympic champion \nat the pole vault,"},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"and also the world record holder."},"676":{"dur":3,"text":"This is her in the 2012 Olympics, \nshe's clearly very relaxed,"},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"she lies back, \nshe covers herself in a close,"},"683":{"dur":3,"text":"this has the effect \nof shutting out any distractions"},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"but also it has the effect of relaxing her \nand relieving the pressure."},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"So in term of the mind of a winner\nfrom a sport psychology perspective,"},"695":{"dur":3,"text":"an athlete has to be motivated,\nconfident in their abilities,"},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"manage pressure extremely well,"},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"and use these well \ntrained-drilled techniques"},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"like imagery,\nself-talk and relaxation."},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you."},"707":{"dur":1,"text":"(Applause)"}}
