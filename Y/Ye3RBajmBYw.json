that there was this deep anxiety\nin the United States about the future of the"},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"country."},"588":{"dur":4,"text":"The anxiety, because middle class incomes\nare down, because this recession has taken"},"592":{"dur":5,"text":"a long time to get out of, and more generally\nbecause the world seems to be changing very"},"597":{"dur":8,"text":"fast in profound ways, and people felt that\nthe old ways of doing things aren't right,"},"606":{"dur":3,"text":"and so they had to, they were searching around\nfor something new."},"609":{"dur":4,"text":"And in that context, you have lots of people\nsaying education should really simply be a"},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"trade."},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"We need more people who can be welders."},"617":{"dur":6,"text":"You heard it in, I think, the last Republican\ndebate, Marco Rubio said we need fewer philosophers"},"624":{"dur":5,"text":"and more welders, and then the New York Times,\nin its inimitable way, did a fact check, and"},"629":{"dur":6,"text":"discovered that the average wage of a philosophy\nmajor was $92,000 and the average wage of"},"635":{"dur":5,"text":"a welder was $42,000, so that simply on a\nfactual basis, it wasn't correct."},"641":{"dur":5,"text":"But there is that anxiety, and I wanted to\ntry to articulate a defense for this very"},"647":{"dur":4,"text":"American idea that you get a broad general\neducation."},"651":{"dur":4,"text":"You know, in the 19th century, European countries\nlike Germany, France, even Britain for the"},"656":{"dur":4,"text":"most part, with the exception of the Oxbridge\nsystem, had trade-based education."},"661":{"dur":6,"text":"The whole idea was, you apprenticed, you learned\nyour father's trade, and you moved on."},"667":{"dur":4,"text":"In the United States, the feeling was, people\ndidn't want to lock themselves into one city,"},"672":{"dur":5,"text":"one guild, one trade, one craft, they wanted\nto move, they wanted to experience the dynamism"},"678":{"dur":7,"text":"of America, the economy, and so America always\nemphasized from very early on, this idea of"},"685":{"dur":5,"text":"a broad, general education, that would prepare\nyou not for your first job, but for your sixth"},"691":{"dur":1,"text":"job."},"692":{"dur":5,"text":"There was a sense that life changes, society\nchanges, that you change, and you try to develop"},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"this broad set of general skills."},"699":{"dur":6,"text":"The second piece of it was, that I felt people\ndidn't understand what innovation was all"},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"about."},"707":{"dur":3,"text":"The idea seemed to be that we all need to\nbecome software programmers, and that that"},"710":{"dur":5,"text":"would make us very innovative as a society,\nbut innovation is actually a much broader,"},"716":{"dur":6,"text":"more complicated thing, and if you try to\nlook at what societies are genuinely innovative,"},"722":{"dur":5,"text":"you find yourself surprised, and I was surprised\nby this."},"727":{"dur":5,"text":"We all know that Americans do very badly at\nstandardized tests, compared with, you know,"},"732":{"dur":3,"text":"our peers in the rich world."},"735":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I ask myself, well how did we do ten\nyears ago?"},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"The answer is very badly."},"741":{"dur":1,"text":"How did we do twenty years ago?"},"743":{"dur":1,"text":"Very badly."},"744":{"dur":6,"text":"How did we do in 1963, the first time there\nwas an international test of fifteen-year-olds?"},"750":{"dur":1,"text":"Very badly."},"752":{"dur":5,"text":"So you ask yourself, but if you look back\nover the last 40 years, what country has dominated"},"757":{"dur":4,"text":"the world of science, technology, innovation,\nentrepreneurship, and economic growth, it's"},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"the United States?"},"764":{"dur":7,"text":"So, somehow we're very bad at tests, but very\ngood at life, and how to explain that paradox."},"771":{"dur":3,"text":"So I looked at other countries that are undeniably\ninnovative."},"775":{"dur":5,"text":"Sweden and Israel really pop off the charts\non a per-capita basis, obviuosly."},"781":{"dur":3,"text":"And you ask yourself, what is it in them?"},"784":{"dur":3,"text":"So the first thing I did was looked at how\nthey did in these science tests."},"788":{"dur":1,"text":"Guess what the answer is."},"789":{"dur":1,"text":"Worse than the United States."},"791":{"dur":5,"text":"So, we come 24th in math in the PISA test,\nSweden comes 26th, Israel comes 27th."},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"Now what do they have in common?"},"799":{"dur":4,"text":"They're all very open, dynamic, flexible societies,\nwith the economies."},"803":{"dur":4,"text":"They're all very non-hierarchical in their\napproach to education, in their approach to"},"808":{"dur":4,"text":"life, so that, you know, a junior researcher\ncan challenge something that a senior researcher"},"812":{"dur":1,"text":"does."},"813":{"dur":4,"text":"A junior person in a firm can challenge what\nthe C.E.O. wants."},"818":{"dur":1,"text":"They're also very confident."},"820":{"dur":5,"text":"This is something you can actually measure,\nbecause the PISA test started asking, at one"},"825":{"dur":5,"text":"point, in the early '80s, after you did the\nmath, they would ask you, how do you think"},"831":{"dur":2,"text":"you did on the math test?"},"834":{"dur":3,"text":"You can imagine what happens to the American\nstudents."},"837":{"dur":5,"text":"We do lousily in math, but we do really well\non how we think we did."},"843":{"dur":5,"text":"And so, when hearing this Bill Bennett, the\nSecretary of Education at the time, said,"},"849":{"dur":4,"text":"it's clear what the problem in America is,\nwe're beating at teaching self esteem than"},"853":{"dur":1,"text":"science."},"854":{"dur":5,"text":"And it's a good laugh, but I would put it\nto you, that if you're trying to encourage"},"859":{"dur":5,"text":"entrepreneurship in a society, what's probably\nmore important than science is self esteem."},"865":{"dur":1,"text":"You have to have confidence in yourself."},"867":{"dur":1,"text":"You have to have confidence in your ideas."},"868":{"dur":4,"text":"You have to have confidence that you can make\nit, even when you fail, because all entrepreneus"},"873":{"dur":4,"text":"fail the first, and the second, and the third\ntime, and they pick themselves up."},"877":{"dur":1,"text":"That's why Americans do well."},"879":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not that we have better scientific training\nthan Germany."},"881":{"dur":2,"text":"Germany has much better scientific training\nthan we do."},"884":{"dur":3,"text":"Yet their rates of entrepreneurship are much\nworse than the United States."},"887":{"dur":1,"text":"Why?"},"888":{"dur":2,"text":"Because they don't have that sense of confidence."},"891":{"dur":5,"text":"They don't have that sense that bankruptcy\nis a temporary path to progress, rather than"},"896":{"dur":2,"text":"a permanent matter of shame and obstacle."},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"Look at Donald Trump, boasting about bankruptcies."},"902":{"dur":7,"text":"So, for both reasons, I felt that we were\nmisunderstanding the unique nature of American"},"909":{"dur":5,"text":"education, but also how societies and how\npeople innovate."},"914":{"dur":2,"text":"Sam: Let me ask Leon now."},"917":{"dur":6,"text":"Young though you are, you've been the president\nof a college for a very long time, and you,"},"924":{"dur":4,"text":"for some forty years or more, and you've watched\nAmerican education change."},"928":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, you have been one of the innovators\nyourself."},"932":{"dur":5,"text":"Some may remember a long profile of Leon in\nthe New Yorker, fairly recently, about a new"},"938":{"dur":5,"text":"approach you had to college admission and\napplications, how they should be done."},"943":{"dur":8,"text":"What are the most important changes you've\nseen for better and worse?"},"952":{"dur":10,"text":"Leon: So, I'm most impressed by how things\nremain the same."},"962":{"dur":5,"text":"People have a certain kind of investment in\ndescribing a change that doesn't really exist,"},"968":{"dur":2,"text":"or is actually very superficial."},"970":{"dur":7,"text":"So, I actually think that, actually the university\nitself, and the [inaudible] system, and I"},"978":{"dur":4,"text":"think Fareed made this point, has remained\nreasonably stable."},"983":{"dur":3,"text":"Much less has changed than we would like to\nthink."},"986":{"dur":5,"text":"One of the reasons why I am not particularly\nutopian or dystopian on technology."},"992":{"dur":5,"text":"You know, we've been living with this sort\nof, you know, that the computer and internet"},"998":{"dur":6,"text":"were going to put the classroom out

right, or the Connecticut\nYankee in King Arthur's Court, wasn't there"},"1016":{"dur":2,"text":"such a story?"},"1018":{"dur":6,"text":"If someone from the 12th century woke up,\nand walked on a campus of a university, they"},"1024":{"dur":2,"text":"would see more continuity than change."},"1027":{"dur":6,"text":"Yet, since the 12th century, if I listed all\nthe technologies which have entered our life,"},"1034":{"dur":7,"text":"you know, the current technological revolution\nis going to be absorbed and adapted to the"},"1041":{"dur":2,"text":"very fundamental character of how universities\nwork."},"1044":{"dur":6,"text":"So, in America, I think very little has changed,\nexcept in some respect, in the way the public"},"1050":{"dur":1,"text":"looks at it."},"1052":{"dur":3,"text":"There's much more emphasis on a kind of reductive\nstandardized testing."},"1056":{"dur":2,"text":"This has been an American disease."},"1058":{"dur":7,"text":"Bad tests that drive curriculum and give policy-makers\na handle on whether things are going well"},"1066":{"dur":2,"text":"or not, which are inaccurate."},"1068":{"dur":8,"text":"And, a sort of fear, and an anti-intellectualism\ntoward who becomes a teacher, and how we treat"},"1077":{"dur":2,"text":"a teacher in our classrooms."},"1080":{"dur":1,"text":"And no sane person would become a teacher."},"1081":{"dur":1,"text":"Sam: And do you mean before the college level?"},"1083":{"dur":1,"text":"Leon: Before the college level."},"1084":{"dur":3,"text":"Sam: Because you've written that fifteen-\nand sixteen-year-olds are ready for college."},"1088":{"dur":6,"text":"Leon: The real weak spot in American education\nhas always remained, in my view, adolesecence."},"1094":{"dur":5,"text":"So, the majority of Americans didn't finish\nhigh school until after the Second World War."},"1099":{"dur":3,"text":"And our system of high school has something\nadmirable, which explains why the liberal"},"1103":{"dur":4,"text":"arts are so important in the United States,\nbecause we didn't have a university preparatory,"},"1108":{"dur":7,"text":"secondary system, which selected people out\nat 11th grade or 13th age, and so what you"},"1115":{"dur":3,"text":"had is a democratic system in which people\nlearned to live together, but knew how to"},"1119":{"dur":3,"text":"do nothing at all, and they went to college."},"1122":{"dur":6,"text":"And the idea of the liberal arts that we have\nnow really derives from America's entrance"},"1129":{"dur":2,"text":"to World War I."},"1132":{"dur":5,"text":"Here in New York, when Nicholas Murray Butler\nand Columbia decided, we're sending people"},"1137":{"dur":5,"text":"to die in the fields of France, and they have\nno idea where they are or why they're there."},"1142":{"dur":1,"text":"And so..."},"1143":{"dur":1,"text":"Sam: From Columbia."},"1144":{"dur":1,"text":"Leon: Columbia, yeah."},"1145":{"dur":4,"text":"So, suddenly our conception of general education,\nthe liberal arts, and all this rhetoric picks"},"1150":{"dur":3,"text":"up from an 18th- and 19th-century tendency..."},"1154":{"dur":5,"text":"Jefferson was very concerned, that's why Jefferson\nwas invoked, to create an American educational"},"1159":{"dur":5,"text":"system that fit American politics and American\nlife, and that was not an import."},"1165":{"dur":4,"text":"And we created a hybrid of the British Oxbridge\nsystem and the German university that influenced"},"1170":{"dur":1,"text":"that land grant universities."},"1172":{"dur":4,"text":"But the idea of a liberal arts education,\na general education, was compensatory for"},"1176":{"dur":5,"text":"a very poor secondary schooling by comparison\nto European standards."},"1182":{"dur":4,"text":"So, the fact is that..."},"1186":{"dur":4,"text":"But the weak spot has always remained, especially\nas more and more people came into the public"},"1190":{"dur":4,"text":"system, the secondary, the high school, the\nAmerican high school."},"1195":{"dur":7,"text":"And so, what I've seen over the last twenty\nyears, is that that has not improved."},"1202":{"dur":3,"text":"We do not recruit better people into the teaching\nsystem."},"1206":{"dur":4,"text":"The depression was great for teachers, because\npeople couldn't find work elsewhere, went"},"1210":{"dur":5,"text":"into the teaching profession, and we had a\nmuch higher quality of teacher in the '40s"},"1216":{"dur":1,"text":"and '50s."},"1217":{"dur":6,"text":"Many of them retired, and the replacements\nwere not from the same
