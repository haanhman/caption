this BRAF mutation, that\nthose patients live longer."},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"And actually we were able\nto show in the laboratory"},"411":{"dur":1,"text":"that if you give this\nsame drug to cells"},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"that lack the BRAF mutation,\nthose cells actually"},"415":{"dur":0,"text":"grow faster."},"416":{"dur":1,"text":"So it really becomes\ncritical

faster"},"435":{"dur":1,"text":"and they may die quicker."},"437":{"dur":3,"text":"So really what the challenge has\nbecome somewhat in our cancer"},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"population is how\ndo we figure out"},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"who's got what mutations\nwithin their tumor?"},"446":{"dur":1,"text":"Because again,\nthese mutations can"},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"be scattered over this\nentire

expand\nout the number"},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"of patients who would benefit?"},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"And the real inspiration\nfor this work"},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"was this clinical trial

it"},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"was an open clinical trial at\nSloan Kettering at the time,"},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"this woman enrolled on\nthe Everolimus study."},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"And despite the

Everolimus."},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you look at this\npatient in retrospect,"},"815":{"dur":3,"text":"she was the perfect\npatient to get this drug."},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"We simply didn't

really"},"2037":{"dur":1,"text":"test these new drugs?"},"2039":{"dur":1,"text":"And so there's\nreally two main ways"},"2041":{"dur":1,"text":"we can do these clinical

particular cancer type."},"2049":{"dur":3,"text":"So this would be a master\nprotocol for patients with lung"},"2053":{"dur":1,"text":"cancer, as an example."},"2054":{"dur":2,"text":"And so what we do here is\nwe sequence all the patients"},"2057":{"dur":2,"text":"with lung cancer, maybe\nat multiple institutions."},"2060":{"dur":2,"text":"And then depending upon\nwhat mutation they have,"},"2062":{"dur":2,"text":"we put them on different\ndrugs based upon that."},"2065":{"dur":2,"text":"And many of the doctors\nlike this approach,"},"2067":{"dur":1,"text":"because as I mentioned\nearlier, it's"},"2069":{"dur":2,"text":"very hard to find the funds\nto sequence the patients."},"2071":{"dur":2,"text":"And so if you have a\nclinical trial like this,"},"2073":{"dur":3,"text":"you can ask the drug companies\nmaybe that make these drugs--"},"2076":{"dur":2,"text":"the EGFR inhibitor, the BRAF\ninhibitor, the MAC inhibitor--"},"2079":{"dur":2,"text":"to maybe pay for the sequencing."},"2081":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is one way\nthat we try to do this."},"2084":{"dur":1,"text":"And there are some\nmaster protocols open"},"2085":{"dur":4,"text":"for patients with lung cancer\nand some other tumor types."},"2090":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a few problems\nwith this approach though."},"2092":{"dur":3,"text":"One is that oftentimes\nit's not the same drug"},"2095":{"dur":2,"text":"company that makes each drug."},"2097":{"dur":3,"text":"And so drug company one might\nmake the EGFR inhibitor,"},"2101":{"dur":2,"text":"drug company two may\nmake the BRAF inhibitor,"},"2103":{"dur":1,"text":"and so on and so forth."},"2104":{"dur":2,"text":"So sometimes you can spend\na year or two negotiating"},"2107":{"dur":1,"text":"with different drug\ncompanies to get"},"2108":{"dur":3,"text":"the different drugs into this\none giganto clinical trial."},"2112":{"dur":2,"text":"And by the time you've\nactually secured the drugs"},"2114":{"dur":2,"text":"and opened the trial, maybe\none or two of these drugs"},"2117":{"dur":1,"text":"have already failed\nin another context"},"2118":{"dur":3,"text":"and they're not really the best\nin class drug that's available."},"2121":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's one downside."},"2124":{"dur":2,"text":"The other downside\nI'm going to focus on"},"2126":{"dur":2,"text":"is that oftentimes these\nare small clinical trials."},"2128":{"dur":3,"text":"And maybe you're sequencing\nin this clinical trial"},"2132":{"dur":1,"text":"200 patients."},"2134":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you've got a\nmutation in the population"},"2136":{"dur":2,"text":"that you're

respond to this specific\ninhibitor of that drug?"},"2152":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's one approach."},"2154":{"dur":1,"text":"But if you could find\nthe right patient ,"},"2156":{"dur":1,"text":"you can sometimes see\nthese incredible effects."},"2158":{"dur":2,"text":"This is a patient\nwith lung cancer."},"2160":{"dur":4,"text":"And actually in lung\ncancer, these BRAF mutations"},"2164":{"dur":4,"text":"I mentioned to you earlier only\nmake up about 1% to maybe 2%"},"2169":{"dur":1,"text":"of the population."},"2170":{"dur":4,"text":"But if you can find that

two."},"2192":{"dur":2,"text":"So again, if you can\nmatch the right patient"},"2194":{"dur":4,"text":"on to the right drug by some\nmechanism, this can work."},"2199":{"dur":3,"text":"But for these rare mutations,\nthis type of master protocol"},"2202":{"dur":2,"text":"design is really inefficient."},"2205":{"dur":2,"text":"So what we've tried to do\nis create a different type"},"2207":{"dur":4,"text":"of trial design that works for\nmutations where the mutation is"},"2211":{"dur":1,"text":"found in a lot of\ndifferent cancers,"},"2213":{"dur":1,"text":"but is not
