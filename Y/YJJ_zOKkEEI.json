problem,"},"339":{"dur":2,"text":"it was a different set of people."},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe a third had been on a\ncommittee like that before"},"344":{"dur":3,"text":"and the rest were new, and

say, what I appreciate now"},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"is this is one of the greatest strengths"},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"of American higher education"},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"is the diversity of

way"},"448":{"dur":1,"text":"is just ludicrous."},"450":{"dur":3,"text":"And so the freedom that\neach institution has"},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"to imagine itself is wonderful,"},"457":{"dur":4,"text":"and if you compare the success\nof American higher education"},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"to any other nation, I\nthink much of that

science and engineering\neducation with liberal arts."},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean people forget that MIT has"},"499":{"dur":1,"text":"adamantly liberal arts,"},"502":{"dur":4,"text":"but the style of education and\nthe purpose of the university"},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"at MIT is very different\nfrom that imagined by Yale."},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"So at the heart of Yale is the

different assumptions,"},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"different ways of approaching problems,"},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"but I think one of the other\nfascinating things for me,"},"524":{"dur":3,"text":"if you look at the history of\nhigher education in America,"},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"Harvard, Brown, Princeton, Yale,"},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"these schools were all\nbegun as divinity schools"},"533":{"dur":4,"text":"because what the new nation\nneeded was ministers,"},"537":{"dur":4,"text":"and that was what universities,\ncolleges then were for."},"541":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's

there is a sense of the ivory tower"},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"and a place removed from the"},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"rigors of daily life."},"564":{"dur":4,"text":"MIT, founded in 1865,\nits premise was we needed"},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"a new kind of university to accelerate"},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"the industrialization of America."},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"The industrial revolution was happening."},"574":{"dur":3,"text":"We weren't educating anyone who\ncould lead these industries."},"578":{"dur":3,"text":"Agriculture needed to\nstep up the game because"},"582":{"dur":3,"text":"as now, everyone was worried\nthere wouldn't be enough food,"},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"and we needed to help farmers design"},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"more productive agricultural

education"},"597":{"dur":1,"text":"that the new nation needed,"},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"and MIT very much in leadership."},"599":{"dur":1,"text":"so this idea about hands on

new."},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"So one of the themes at\nMIT is learning by doing."},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"We really mean learning by doing,"},"611":{"dur":3,"text":"and what I often say about\nMIT is MIT was designed"},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"to do tech transfer."},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"That was one of the fundamental principles"},"619":{"dur":1,"text":"of MIT's education,"},"621":{"dur":4,"text":"meaning engaging the real world\nin real time in real ways."},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"So very different"},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"from the premise of Ivy\nLeague institutions."},"631":{"dur":4,"text":"I just find this whole\nthing absolutely fascinating"},"635":{"dur":4,"text":"and exciting in the sense of\nall of the many different

it,"},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"but most people just think of\ncollege as college as college,"},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"university as university,\nbut it really isn't,"},"649":{"dur":3,"text":"and I think that is one of\nour nation's great strengths."},"653":{"dur":3,"text":"- I want to pick up on a theme\nembedded in your comments"},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"regarding place."},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"Under your leadership,\nyou took OpenCourseWare,"},"662":{"dur":3,"text":"one of the great gifts\nthat MIT gave to the world"},"666":{"dur":3,"text":"and turned that into\nMITx, which became edX,"},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"with the joint commitment of Harvard,"},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"and we were very fortunate to be"},"675":{"dur":4,"text":"invited early in to be a member\nof the consortium on edX."},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"But embedded in that is a tension"},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"between the importance of place"},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"and the role that

revolution."},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"How do you think about that balance?"},"728":{"dur":4,"text":"- Yeah, so important questions,\nfascinating questions."},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"Truth be told, what was in\nmy mind, my predecessor,"},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"unfortunately the\nrecently late Chuck Vest,"},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"started OpenCourseWare, and\nit was just getting started"},"744":{"dur":1,"text":"when I arrived."},"745":{"dur":1,"text":"I sure didn't understand\nit until I got to MIT,"},"747":{"dur":3,"text":"and then I was kind of\nstunned by the power,"},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"the potential of OpenCourseWare."},"756":{"dur":1,"text":"But when, a couple things."},"758":{"dur":1,"text":"So OpenCourseWare started."},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"MIT started a distance\nlearning collaboration"},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"with Singapore about the same time"},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"teaching a course in real\ntime to a classroom at MIT"},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"and one 12 hours away, 12 hours\ntime zone away in Singapore,"},"772":{"dur":2,"text":"and what we saw was that every time,"},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"virtually every time a faculty member"},"777":{"dur":1,"text":"put her or his material"},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"or the course on OpenCourseWare,"},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"they discovered a new way to teach."},"789":{"dur":3,"text":"The faculty who participated\nin the Singapore MIT alliance,"},"792":{"dur":4,"text":"this distance learning,\ndistance and present learning,"},"796":{"dur":4,"text":"similarly told me that they\nchanged the way they taught,"},"801":{"dur":3,"text":"and what was revealed to me\nis that we can't just ask"},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"our faculty to invent\nnew pedagogical tools."},"809":{"dur":1,"text":"Just go do it, right?"},"810":{"dur":2,"text":"Without giving them laboratories."},"813":{"dur":3,"text":"So OpenCourseWare and SMA, MITx, edX,"},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"I think the most important\ncontribution they make"},"821":{"dur":3,"text":"is changing the way we\nteach for our students."},"826":{"dur":2,"text":"So the faculty who change\nthe way that they teach"},"828":{"dur":1,"text":"for OCW wasn't just for OCW."},"830":{"dur":3,"text":"They changed the

technologies."},"841":{"dur":4,"text":"Look our students are arriving\nborn mobile, born digital,"},"847":{"dur":2,"text":"and to imagine that they will be compelled"},"850":{"dur":2,"text":"by the same kind of teaching technologies"},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"that have compelled students\nfor hundreds of years,"},"855":{"dur":1,"text":"I think is wishful thinking."},"857":{"dur":3,"text":"And frankly, if we don't\nuse new technologies"},"860":{"dur":2,"text":"to improve our pedagogy to enhance it,"},"862":{"dur":2,"text":"to make it more compelling,"},"865":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean there are any number of ways"},"867":{"dur":2,"text":"you can think of making it better,"},"869":{"dur":1,"text":"is a disservice."},"871":{"dur":3,"text":"And so all of these new ways of teaching,"},"875":{"dur":2,"text":"new ways of conveying information,"},"880":{"dur":1,"text":"I think at its heart"},"882":{"dur":3,"text":"are laboratories for new pedagogies."},"885":{"dur":1,"text":"Enormously valuable."},"887":{"dur":2,"text":"A side product is the\nmaterial is available"},"890":{"dur":2,"text":"to anyone in the world,\nand that's

continue."},"955":{"dur":1,"text":"We're not going to be put\nout of business anytime soon."},"957":{"dur":1,"text":"So what happened with OpenCourseWare"},"959":{"dur":2,"text":"when I was president

the"},"983":{"dur":2,"text":"resource that we give the world."},"986":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm so moved."},"987":{"dur":2,"text":"There have been 150 million people"},"989":{"dur":2,"text":"who have used
