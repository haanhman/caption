Well"},"512":{"dur":5,"text":"in Hebrew chapter 2, it says in the midst\nof the church will I sing praise unto thee."},"518":{"dur":7,"text":"Well that\u2019s a quote from psalm 22:22, when\nhe said in the midst of the congregation will"},"525":{"dur":4,"text":"I sing praise unto thee.

Why? Because\nthe church is a congregation. And so people"},"540":{"dur":4,"text":"are congregated, that\u2019s what a church is,\nand assembly of believers.

The"},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"church at Ephesus, the church at Smyrna, the\nchurch at Pergamos, you know, the church at"},"567":{"dur":5,"text":"Tempe, the church in Sacramento, the church\nin Dallas, Fort Worth. It doesn\u2019t matter"},"573":{"dur":4,"text":"where, whether it\u2019s in Miami Florida, or\nwhether it\u2019s in New York City. These are"},"577":{"dur":6,"text":"assemblies of believers.

Each church has Jesus Christ"},"589":{"dur":5,"text":"as its head, if it is a scriptural church.\nSo when we talk about \u201cyou know, the Laodicean"},"595":{"dur":6,"text":"church, is this...\u201d And they try to lump\nall Christianity today as \u201cthe Laodicean"},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"church age.\u201d That\u2019s not true because there\nare a lot of churches out there that are like"},"605":{"dur":4,"text":"Laodicea. But let me tell you something. Not\nevery church is like Laodicea, and not every"},"610":{"dur":4,"text":"church has to be lukewarm, and not every church\nhas to discuss Jesus Christ to the point where"},"615":{"dur":4,"text":"he would spit them out of his mouth, as he\nsaid about the Laodicean church.

It has nothing to do with the age\nthat we are living in! It has to do with the"},"653":{"dur":5,"text":"fact that we need to read Revelation 3, and\nunderstand what we need to change in order"},"658":{"dur":4,"text":"to not be lukewarm. And when we look at Ephesians,\nwe need to see hey, we don\u2019t want to lose"},"663":{"dur":3,"text":"our first love. Let\u2019s get out and do the\nfirst works. Let\u2019s get out there and go"},"666":{"dur":3,"text":"soul winning, and let\u2019s go out and preach\nthe gospel to every creature, so that our"},"670":{"dur":7,"text":"love can burn bright, and not as the Bible\nsays in Mathew 24, that our iniquity would"},"678":{"dur":4,"text":"abound, that would cause our love to grow\ncold. And we would lose our first love. And"},"682":{"dur":6,"text":"so I want you to be very clear on this. These\nare literal physical churches that had various"},"689":{"dur":6,"text":"problems. And they also had various strengths.\nAnd we\u2019re not talking about \u201cchurch ages\u201d"},"695":{"dur":5,"text":"or \u201cperiods of time\u201d. That is a man made\nfalse doctrine that\u2019s not Biblical. It doesn\u2019t"},"700":{"dur":5,"text":"match up with the reality of the Bible. Now,\nalthough these churches were literal churches"},"706":{"dur":6,"text":"that no longer exist today, we can apply the\nprinciples that he gave to them, unto ourselves"},"712":{"dur":5,"text":"and unto churches in the day that we live.\nNot only that, there are certain things that"},"718":{"dur":5,"text":"are spoken to these churches that are symbolic.\nAnd they have underlying meaning. So basically"},"723":{"dur":5,"text":"there is a surface meaning, of the literal\ninterpretation of what he was saying specifically"},"728":{"dur":4,"text":"to that church at Ephesus. But then often\nthere are also underlying more symbolic meanings"},"733":{"dur":4,"text":"under the surface, and we will get into that\nin a moment. But look if you would at verse"},"737":{"dur":3,"text":"number 7. \u201cHe that hath an ear\u201d, this\nis the last thing that he says to the church"},"741":{"dur":4,"text":"at Ephesus. \u201cHe that hath an ear let him\nhear what the spirit saith unto the churches."},"745":{"dur":4,"text":"To him that overcometh will I give to eat\nof the tree of life, which is in the midst"},"750":{"dur":4,"text":"of the paradise of God.\u201d Now what does it\nmean, \u201cTo him that overcometh\u201d? This is"},"754":{"dur":3,"text":"a phrase that you are going to see over and\nover again. He says it to every one of these"},"757":{"dur":3,"text":"seven churches. He says \u201cto him that overcometh,\nto him that ovvercometh, to him that overcometh.\u201d"},"761":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, let\u2019s look up what the Bible teaches\nabout the subject of overcoming, because it"},"766":{"dur":4,"text":"is a word that is not often used in the Bible.\nIt\u2019s only used a few times. Go back to 1st"},"770":{"dur":4,"text":"John chapter 5, just a few pages to the left\nin your bible. And let me show you what the"},"774":{"dur":7,"text":"Bible is talking about when it says \u201covercometh\u201d.\nLook at 1st John chapter 5, verse 4.

It\u2019s being saved. And he\nsays \u201cwho is he that overcometh the world,"},"812":{"dur":4,"text":"but he that believeth that Jesus is the son\nof God.\u201d So the one who believes on the"},"816":{"dur":4,"text":"Lord Jesus Christ, that\u2019s the one who is\nagain.

Now, go to Revelation 21, let me show you"},"825":{"dur":7,"text":"how consistent this is. Because the concept\nof \u201covercoming\u201d is mentioned in 1st John"},"832":{"dur":4,"text":"5, we see it a lot in Revelation 2 and 3,\nbut then it pops up again in Revelation 21."},"836":{"dur":7,"text":"Look at verse number 7. \u201cHe that overcometh\nshall inherit all things and I will be his"},"844":{"dur":6,"text":"God, and he shall be my son.\u201d So according\nto this verse, overcoming makes you a son"},"850":{"dur":4,"text":"of God.

He said \u201cwho\nis he that overcometh the world, but he that"},"859":{"dur":5,"text":"believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?\u201d\nThat\u2019s salvation. And when the Bible talks"},"864":{"dur":3,"text":"about overcoming, it is talking about salvation.\nIt is really clear when you look at the next"},"868":{"dur":5,"text":"verse 8 there in Revelation 21. \u201cBut the\nfearful and unbelieving and the abominable,"},"873":{"dur":4,"text":"and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers\nand idolaters and all liars, shall have their"},"877":{"dur":4,"text":"part in the lake which burneth with fire and\nbrimstone which is the second death.

So let\u2019s go back to chapter 2, now that"},"921":{"dur":4,"text":"we laid down the concept of overcoming. So\nwe saw that the church of Ephesus, their problem"},"926":{"dur":4,"text":"was that they had lost their first love. And\nthe reason that they had lost their first"},"930":{"dur":3,"text":"love, was that they weren\u2019t doing the first\nworks.

So they\nwere cast out, so they would not eat of the"},"973":{"dur":4,"text":"tree of life and live forever.
