They're really fussy, but this dish is really simple and it's really really tasty."},"14":{"dur":2,"text":"We're going to do lamb loins, with a salsa verde and braised lettuce and peas."},"18":{"dur":3,"text":"It's really simple and can all be done in twenty minutes."},"27":{"dur":2,"text":"The first thing that we want to do is get started with our lamb loins."},"30":{"dur":3,"text":"We've got these beautiful lamb loins. As you can see they've all been trimmed up from the butcher."},"34":{"dur":2,"text":"You can get them even in the supermarkets these days."},"37":{"dur":1,"text":"We're gonna seize them up."},"38":{"dur":4,"text":"Always with a bit of rock salt and then a bit of pepper."},"43":{"dur":1,"text":"Just like that."},"44":{"dur":3,"text":"We're just gonna whack a bit of oil in the pan that's really nice and hot now. I can feel the heat coming off."},"48":{"dur":3,"text":"The searing on the lamb is really important as that's where all the flavour is."},"52":{"dur":2,"text":"The caramelisation gives it that nice juicy flavour."},"55":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm going to give you a little tip for putting these loins into the hot pan."},"59":{"dur":3,"text":"Always lay them away from you. Just like that."},"63":{"dur":3,"text":"So then the oil doesn't splash back into your face or onto your hands."},"67":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll put the last one in there."},"68":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm just going to give my hands a rinse as I've been using raw meat."},"72":{"dur":3,"text":"As you can hear, can you hear that sizzle in there? It's coming along nicely."},"76":{"dur":3,"text":"As you can see it's starting to get a nice brown on there."},"79":{"dur":4,"text":"We've already got our oven pre-heated on 180 degrees. So once these are seared and turned over"},"85":{"dur":3,"text":"we're going to bung it in there for eight to ten minutes for medium nice pink lamb."},"88":{"dur":4,"text":"As you can see. Look! Look at that beautiful flavour. It's all crispy, it's going to be all juicy."},"94":{"dur":1,"text":"That's every bit of flavour."},"95":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm gonna turn him over there, get that one there using the tong."},"100":{"dur":2,"text":"This can go straight into the oven."},"102":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, we've got these pans, and they're oven-proof."},"106":{"dur":3,"text":"Not all pans can go in the oven as they've got plastic handles."},"110":{"dur":2,"text":"So make sure it's oven-proof."},"112":{"dur":2,"text":"Put them straight in here."},"118":{"dur":4,"text":"So they're in the oven for eight minutes. So now I'm going to get on and make our lettuce and peas."},"122":{"dur":4,"text":"So we've got these beautiful, beautiful, baby gem lettuce's. You can pick them up in all supermarkets."},"127":{"dur":5,"text":"So i've got four of these little ones, one per person. And what we want to do is"},"132":{"dur":3,"text":"we just want to slice them in half. Just like that."},"137":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's as simple as that. That's all the preparation you need to do."},"140":{"dur":5,"text":"We've got a pan on there, and in there, that's hot now, we're going to put a knob of butter"},"146":{"dur":4,"text":"So while that's melting down, we're going to put our stock in there, because"},"150":{"dur":4,"text":"this is what they call an emulsion. I didn't even know what an emulsion was. I thought it was paint."},"155":{"dur":1,"text":"But yeah, they cook in emulsions in all these fancy kitchens."},"158":{"dur":4,"text":"Right, so we've got our lettuces there. Our stocks come up to the boil, our little emulsion."},"162":{"dur":5,"text":"And we're just going to lay these little babies in there, face down, for six to seven minutes."},"170":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm just going to pop the all in, they'll all fit."},"172":{"dur":6,"text":"I'm just going to season them with a tiny bit of salt, to keep the flavour in, and a tiny bit of pepper."},"179":{"dur":4,"text":"We don't want to put too much salt in at the moment as the chicken stock is always seasoned"},"184":{"dur":1,"text":"and you don't want salty, salty food."},"186":{"dur":3,"text":"And another tip for you, cook with a lid on. It traps all that flavour, flavour, flavour."},"189":{"dur":4,"text":"So we're going to let them sit for six to seven minutes, and while we're sat there we're going to crack on"},"194":{"dur":0,"text":"and make our salsa verde."},"195":{"dur":3,"text":"Now we've got these lovely herbs. It smells so, so good."},"199":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm going to use some fresh mint, because mint and lamb is a marriage made in heaven."},"202":{"dur":5,"text":"I've got some parsley, some fresh basil and I also like to use a little bit of dill."},"207":{"dur":4,"text":"Don't worry about, you know, getting rid of the stalks, the stalks are all flavour. why waste anything?"},"212":{"dur":3,"text":"And just roughly chop it all up and just bung it all in there like that."},"216":{"dur":3,"text":"What we've got are these beautiful, beautiful anchovies"},"220":{"dur":5,"text":"just want to use five or six of them. Just throw them in."},"226":{"dur":1,"text":"And then we've got these lovely capers."},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"Im just going to put a couple of tablespoons in there."},"231":{"dur":6,"text":"Also, into there we've got some Dijon mustard, just throw that in. It gives it that bit of heat."},"238":{"dur":1,"text":"And some olive oil."},"240":{"dur":0,"text":"Seasoning."},"241":{"dur":6,"text":"Again everything has got to be tasty, but go easy on the salt as the anchovies and the capers are salty."},"247":{"dur":1,"text":"A nice whack of pepper."},"248":{"dur":5,"text":"We're only using half an onion here. Just whack off, you know, the peeling bit."},"255":{"dur":0,"text":"Follow the lines"},"258":{"dur":6,"text":"Just roughly chop it, and be careful with the fingers. You don't want to chop no fingers off."},"264":{"dur":0,"text":"You don't want to have that in your salsa verde."},"267":{"dur":1,"text":"And then straight into the pot."},"269":{"dur":0,"text":"Like that."},"270":{"dur":5,"text":"And to finish it off, you want some lemon. Were just going to zest it up there. Like that."},"276":{"dur":1,"text":"And then we're just going to throw it into the pot."},"278":{"dur":3,"text":"Straight in. Cut it in half, and a tip for you."},"281":{"dur":2,"text":"Always squeeze lemon into your hand,"},"284":{"dur":2,"text":"because you get rid of all the pips."},"286":{"dur":3,"text":"And I heard a weird story once, on YouTube, that someone ate a pip and then"},"290":{"dur":1,"text":"they had a tree grow in their belly."},"291":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't know if it's true, but I don't fancy that."},"293":{"dur":4,"text":"It's as simple as that, and then by the time our lamb is ready to come out,"},"297":{"dur":2,"text":"our sauce is done, our lettuce is nearly finished, and then that's it."},"300":{"dur":3,"text":"So our lamb's been in the oven for eight minutes now, so we're just going to take them out,"},"304":{"dur":1,"text":"and let them rest for a minute."},"305":{"dur":1,"text":"And then we'll get on and finish off our braise lettuce."},"307":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm just going to rest them onto a plate, cos you don't want them their sitting in all the cooking oil."},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"Otherwise it'll get all horrible and greasy."},"314":{"dur":4,"text":"Just going to put them onto there."},"319":{"dur":1,"text":"Just get rid of this pan."},"320":{"dur":6,"text":"Right, so these have been braised now for six to seven minutes. Can you see that they're bubbling away nicely."},"328":{"dur":3,"text":"Now it's not going to take much longer. This is where we add in our peas."},"331":{"dur":3,"text":"and that will not take that long, it'll take one to two minutes"},"334":{"dur":3,"text":"Just pop that lid back on because we want to trap that flavour in there."},"338":{"dur":3,"text":"Right so they've been in there for two to three minutes and now we can start to plate it all up."},"342":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'm just going to take that off the heat."},"344":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, we're not going to use the stock, we just want the peas and the lettuce"},"347":{"dur":5,"text":"I'm just going to use a slotted spoon because we don't want it sitting there in a horrible pool of juicy mess."},"354":{"dur":4,"text":"And also, pretty much most of our emulsion has bubbled away and gone into our lettuce."},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"So all that lovely chicken stock is adding extra flavours to them lettuce."},"363":{"dur":4,"text":"So our meat's been resting for five minutes. Now I like to rest my meat for half of the cooking time."},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"And I like to slice it on the diagonal."},"370":{"dur":3,"text":"Because also, slicing it that way keeps the meat tender."},"375":{"dur":4,"text":"Lovely slices, and as you can see, it's all juicy. It's a sort-of medium."},"382":{"dur":0,"text":"Just like that."},"383":{"dur":0,"text":"That's nice."},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm just going to show you how to plate one of them up."},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going to grab a lovely bit of this beautiful braised lettuce,"},"390":{"dur":3,"text":"and I like to give everyone two, and some of those beautiful pettis."},"394":{"dur":6,"text":"And then look at that beautiful pink lamb loin that I'm going to put in there. The star of the show."},"400":{"dur":1,"text":"and that lovely, lovely salsa verde,"},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to spoon it all over like that."},"405":{"dur":0,"text":"There's loads to go around."},"407":{"dur":4,"text":"I just like to finish with a bit of extra virgin oil, just drizzled over like that."},"412":{"dur":4,"text":"And there you go. My posh nosh. Lamb, salsa verde, braised peas and lettuce,"},"417":{"dur":1,"text":"that's going to blow the girls socks off, and"},"419":{"dur":5,"text":"little time cooking in the kitchen, so I can sit back, drink a glass of wine and enjoy the night."}}
