someone--"},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"just you're sitting next to\none of us-- what are they"},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"going to find interesting\nabout where you have to say."},"366":{"dur":1,"text":"Are there things in\ntheir life that you"},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"might be able to\nconnect to, experiences"},"370":{"dur":2,"text":"that they've had that you\nmight be able to connect to."},"373":{"dur":1,"text":"And the other thing\nthat I think is"},"375":{"dur":3,"text":"really central to being a\nwriter and a successful writer"},"378":{"dur":2,"text":"is to always remember\nit's not about you."},"381":{"dur":2,"text":"You're trying to tell\nsomeone else a story."},"383":{"dur":1,"text":"You're not trying to show off."},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not a sort of\nperformance art."},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"It's important to always\nthink of that reader"},"390":{"dur":1,"text":"right in front of you."},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"And when you're doing-- when\nyou sort of imagine that,"},"394":{"dur":2,"text":"you will sense when\ntheir interest is waning."},"397":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's thing number one."},"398":{"dur":4,"text":"The second sort of most

story"},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"that someone's\ngoing to care about."},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"So I did a story for The\nNew York Times Magazine."},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"It was a profile,\nactually, of a scientist"},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"at MIT named Sebastian Seung."},"422":{"dur":1,"text":"He's since moved on,\nbut he was at MIT,"},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"and he was a

encode\nmemories and thinking."},"437":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is a pretty sort of\ntechnical and abstract topic."},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"So the first thing I\nwould do is think, well,"},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"how might I connect this\nwith the average reader?"},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"What might they\nbe interested in?"},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"So for example, you're probably\ninterested in memories."},"449":{"dur":1,"text":"You're probably\ninterested in identity."},"451":{"dur":3,"text":"You can't really be\nyourself without memory."},"454":{"dur":3,"text":"But then also, I looked for\nways of telling stories."},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"And one of the stories I\ntold in this magazine article"},"460":{"dur":3,"text":"is there was this woman\nin Norway, Anna Bagenholm,"},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"in 1999, who was skiing."},"466":{"dur":0,"text":"She was skiing down."},"467":{"dur":1,"text":"It was sort of a spring day."},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"And her foot got\ncaught on this rock,"},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"and she spun around and\nwas going down headfirst"},"473":{"dur":0,"text":"and landed."},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"And she went through\nthe ice in this river"},"476":{"dur":1,"text":"and got trapped\nunderneath the ice."},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"So her friends rush down\nand try to help her,"},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"but they're not able\nto pull her out."},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"So eventually her heart stops."},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"They call for a\nrescue, and it takes"},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"an hour for the\nhelicopter to get there."},"491":{"dur":1,"text":"So the helicopter lands."},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"At this point, this\nwoman is clinically dead,"},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"and she's flown back\nto this hospital."},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"But sort of\nmiraculously, they're"},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"able to bring her back to\nlife, and she was pretty much,"},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"after a month, as good as new."},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"So at one point, she\nwas effectively dead."},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"There was hardly any\nactivity in her mind."},"508":{"dur":3,"text":"But her whole identity\nhad been preserved just"},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"in the physical\nstructure of her brain."},"514":{"dur":1,"text":"So that was an\nexample of a story"},"516":{"dur":1,"text":"that I would tell in\na magazine article"},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"to try to draw people in\nand get them to understand"},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"what I'm talking about."},"522":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think I'll stop\nthere and let you talk."},"526":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, hi."},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"Thanks for having me here."},"528":{"dur":3,"text":"I do not have any\nlife-or-death stories"},"532":{"dur":1,"text":"in what I'm about to say."},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"Actually, this\nis-- to the extent"},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"that Gareth and I are doing\na good-cop, bad-cop routine,"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"I guess I'm kind of the bad cop."},"541":{"dur":8,"text":"I edit The Boston Globe's\nIdeas section, as Gareth has."},"550":{"dur":3,"text":"I have also been an\neditor on the op-ed

article,"},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"through a newsier\ntype of article."},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"And I guess that's\nthe type of piece"},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"that I'd like to talk\nabout, just because it"},"591":{"dur":1,"text":"is such a thing that is--"},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"such an elementary\nthing that people"},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"find themselves\ndoing first, as they"},"596":{"dur":5,"text":"try to expand beyond academic\nor beyond scientific material."},"602":{"dur":4,"text":"I think in my own\nobservation, different people"},"606":{"dur":3,"text":"in

opinion,"},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"do not insert yourself\ntoo deeply into the piece."},"632":{"dur":4,"text":"And that can disserve the\nwriter like that who tries"},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"to move on to something else."},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"Similarly, I've run\npieces or edited pieces"},"642":{"dur":3,"text":"before from nonprofit\nexecutives who"},"645":{"dur":3,"text":"will say, oh well, let me just\nshow this to six other people"},"648":{"dur":1,"text":"before I show it to you."},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'm, like, no,\nshow it to me first,"},"652":{"dur":1,"text":"because you show it\nto the other people"},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"and they'll sand off all of the\ninteresting edges of the piece,"},"656":{"dur":3,"text":"and I don't want you to do that."},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"With academics, and with\nscientists in particular,"},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"I think the\noccupational hazard is"},"664":{"dur":2,"text":"that everything in\nyour

generalize\nabout things that you"},"676":{"dur":4,"text":"know kind of specifically,\nand stay in your own lane."},"681":{"dur":4,"text":"And I guess I would sort of\ndiscourage you from doing
