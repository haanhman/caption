it."},"336":{"dur":4,"text":"OMB was amazed, but the annual report of Arizona Power,"},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"so proudly trumpeted this achievement for the environment"},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"in Arizona, and the CEO was very proud himself."},"347":{"dur":1,"text":"He cared about the environment."},"349":{"dur":3,"text":"That is an example, and I often think"},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"that how you go into these things,"},"355":{"dur":3,"text":"you mentioned some cultures are less transactional"},"358":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's really true,"},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"and I notice people in

wrote"},"500":{"dur":1,"text":"before we left office,"},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"but those kinds of experience and the secretary"},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"of the Smithsonian had a similar one."},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"When he put up an exhibit or was planning an exhibit,"},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not sure how far along it got,"},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"and it was on the Enola

congress"},"519":{"dur":3,"text":"just were crazy at the idea of even implying"},"523":{"dur":4,"text":"that there's some moral question about that decision"},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"and I remember meeting with him"},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"and we talked about the alternatives he had,"},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"and he concluded to hold his appropriation."},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"It was something that he probably shouldn't do,"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"and I don't think they ever mounted that exhibit,"},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"or certainly not in the way that had been

told is true here."},"632":{"dur":1,"text":"We overflew the site."},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"We were told there were 12 skimmers,"},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"they were all

leaking."},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"He said, well sir the same winds and waves."},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"I said, admiral I'm not blaming you."},"664":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not your problem."},"666":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean it is your problem, it's not your fault,"},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"and finally we agreed, Skinner said, what would you say?"},"673":{"dur":1,"text":"I said, I'd say we're talking to everybody,"},"674":{"dur":1,"text":"we've talked to the governor, we're gonna meet with"},"676":{"dur":4,"text":"the mayors, the tribes, the fishing cooperatives,"},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"and go back and report to the president,"},"682":{"dur":1,"text":"and he's gonna report to the country."},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's what we finally did."},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"My name was mud in the flight back, I must say,"},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"but it seemed to me that instinct,"},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"and I saw it over and over again,"},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"when something happened in the jurisdiction"},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"of an agency, to immediately assume"},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"some responsibility for its having happened,"},"702":{"dur":4,"text":"but some implication that they should embrace it."},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"When in fact, they should go outside the box"},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"and look at it more clearly and see the data,"},"713":{"dur":4,"text":"and myself, I once moved to ban 500 million dollars"},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"worth of wine in Europe because it contained"},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"an unlicensed, unregistered pesticide,"},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"and needless to say that French and Italians"},"727":{"dur":3,"text":"were very upset, and they responded in a way"},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"that culturally I thought was really quite marvelous."},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"I know both those cultures, I went to school in France"},"736":{"dur":1,"text":"and I spent a lot of time in Italy,"},"738":{"dur":1,"text":"and a French man came in and he said,"},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"your quote on the front page of the Wall Street Journal"},"741":{"dur":1,"text":"is saying you're continuing to drink French wine."},"743":{"dur":1,"text":"I said, I am."},"745":{"dur":3,"text":"He said, well why make such a big deal of this?"},"749":{"dur":3,"text":"I said, well I have something called a law,"},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"and if it doesn't have a tolerance and it's in a food,"},"755":{"dur":1,"text":"can't be permitted."},"758":{"dur":4,"text":"So he said, well how about you let us do the testing?"},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"And I said, well we proposed that last year"},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"to have laboratory testing protocols"},"768":{"dur":1,"text":"but don't you think It'd be the wrong time?"},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"And finally he said, well don't test so much."},"771":{"dur":1,"text":"Then the Italian came to see me and he said,"},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"what if I may ask is the problem?"},"777":{"dur":3,"text":"And I said, well the problem is in high doses,"},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"this stuff procymidone causes cancer

worse."},"790":{"dur":1,"text":"Wasn't the cancer."},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"Anyway, it was hard not to laugh,"},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"but this all came on so fast and the stuff"},"798":{"dur":2,"text":"had all been ready for transshipment,"},"801":{"dur":3,"text":"that I didn't get enough information right away"},"806":{"dur":3,"text":"and I finally sat down with all of my scientists"},"809":{"dur":3,"text":"and so forth, and asked a number of questions"},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"about the stuff, and how much we knew about it,"},"816":{"dur":1,"text":"how much the Europeans knew about it."},"818":{"dur":1,"text":"They permit it, why don't we, would we?"},"819":{"dur":2,"text":"Nobody's every applied for a tolerance,"},"822":{"dur":1,"text":"doesn't that tell you something?"},"823":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah it probably does."},"824":{"dur":2,"text":"It must be what we fear."},"827":{"dur":3,"text":"Any rate, I finally said, what's the exposure assumption?"},"831":{"dur":2,"text":"And they said, two liters a day for 40 years."},"833":{"dur":4,"text":"No, nobody drinks two liters of wine a day for God sake,"},"838":{"dur":3,"text":"and this young woman said, yes they do sir, my father does."},"842":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughing)"},"843":{"dur":2,"text":"And I said, with all due respect,"},"846":{"dur":3,"text":"it won't be the wine that causes him health problems."},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean it won't be the procymidone."},"852":{"dur":4,"text":"Anyway, I said, look, it's in 20% of French wine,"},"856":{"dur":2,"text":"so you've gotta assume that the individuals"},"858":{"dur":2,"text":"are only drinking that 20%."},"861":{"dur":2,"text":"I said, what happens if you drop the exposure assumption"},"863":{"dur":1,"text":"to half a liter?"},"866":{"dur":1,"text":"The problem goes away, it's below the level"},"868":{"dur":1,"text":"of regulatory concern."},"869":{"dur":3,"text":"I said, okay do it, and make it

happened, but that's what happened,"},"1357":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's really the nature of government."},"1360":{"dur":2,"text":"Is you go where you need to,"},"1362":{"dur":3,"text":"and you look for the constituencies that you can deal with,"},"1366":{"dur":3,"text":"and frankly I've told you about some of the victories."},"1370":{"dur":1,"text":"You also lose a lot."},"1372":{"dur":2,"text":"- Let me just ask you a clarifying question there."},"1374":{"dur":3,"text":"So you went to Thatcher and did really and end around"},"1377":{"dur":1,"text":"and then Thatcher went to Bush?"},"1378":{"dur":0,"text":"- Exactly."},"1379":{"dur":1,"text":"- Right, so Bush couldn't hear it from you"},"1380":{"dur":1,"text":"but he could hear it from

the issue,"},"1392":{"dur":1,"text":"which was also great."},"1394":{"dur":1,"text":"- But you had these guys against you."},"1396":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean the budget director, I think it was Dick

him wanting"},"1403":{"dur":2,"text":"your travel receipts and really kinda going after you."},"1405":{"dur":1,"text":"This is an interesting story."},"1407":{"dur":2,"text":"- Didn't realize that

thinking, I remember my wife said to me,"},"1421":{"dur":2,"text":"she said, you know I asked you what this job"},"1423":{"dur":2,"text":"was gonna be about and you said it was balancing"},"1425":{"dur":3,"text":"economics, and the environment, and science, and health"},"1429":{"dur":3,"text":"and putting them all together and making policy,"},"1432":{"dur":3,"text":"but she said, it seems to me all you do is fight."},"1435":{"dur":3,"text":"What I'm describing here is the politics of the environment"},"1439":{"dur":2,"text":"in a divided government."},"1441":{"dur":2,"text":"Where the president believe one thing"},"1444":{"dur":1,"text":"and cared about the issues,"},"1445":{"dur":2,"text":"but it was mostly focused, as you might

the budget director could get away"},"1459":{"dur":1,"text":"in front of the chief of staff and others,"},"1461":{"dur":1,"text":"was saying as he once did,"},"1463":{"dur":1,"text":"he said the problem is we've got environmentalist"},"1464":{"dur":3,"text":"running EPA, but then he said the real problem,"},"1468":{"dur":1,"text":"the real problem is we've got an environmentalist"},"1470":{"dur":2,"text":"sitting in there, and he pointed to the oval office."},"1473":{"dur":2,"text":"I remember thinking, is that permissible?"},"1475":{"dur":1,"text":"Is that legit?"},"1476":{"dur":1,"text":"Can you say that?"},"1478":{"dur":1,"text":"- But he did."},"1480":{"dur":1,"text":"- Well I remember one thing that Bush did"},"1481":{"dur":3,"text":"was he announced, and remind me of the details here,"},"1485":{"dur":2,"text":"a ban on drilling, and you had a negotiation."},"1487":{"dur":2,"text":"The CR club was involved and some other folks."},"1490":{"dur":2,"text":"Do you wanna tell that story?"},"1493":{"dur":3,"text":"- Yeah, it wasn't actually, I don't think with the CR club."},"1497":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't think we negotiated with them"},"1498":{"dur":1,"text":"very successfully ever,"},"1501":{"dur":3,"text":"but the president asked my opinion on whether"},"1506":{"dur":3,"text":"or not to ban drilling along the west coast,"},"1510":{"dur":3,"text":"and also as it turned out, the Atlantic coast,"},"1514":{"dur":3,"text":"and I said, I think it's an easy choice,"},"1520":{"dur":1,"text":"and I said that with some trepidation."},"1522":{"dur":2,"text":"This was an oil man after all."},"1524":{"dur":3,"text":"I said, Duke Magen tried to it, tried to drill."},"1529":{"dur":3,"text":"Reagan tried to drill, Watt, secretary under Reagan"},"1533":{"dur":1,"text":"tried to open it up."},"1535":{"dur":1,"text":"Nobody succeeded."},"1536":{"dur":3,"text":"I said, simply ban it and take credit for it."},"1539":{"dur":1,"text":"You can't do it anyway."},"1542":{"dur":2,"text":"He said to me, do you think that if I do this,"},"1544":{"dur":2,"text":"he first of all said, look the drilling has gotten"},"1547":{"dur":2,"text":"much more safe and reliable than it ever was"},"1549":{"dur":2,"text":"in the days when we had the big blowout"},"1551":{"dur":2,"text":"off southern California."},"1554":{"dur":1,"text":"He said, do you think if I do this,"},"1555":{"dur":1,"text":"environmentalists are gonna say it's"},"1557":{"dur":1,"text":"another wimpish half measure?"},"1558":{"dur":1,"text":"'Cause I'm only gonna do it for 10 years,"},"1559":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not gonna do it permanently."},"1561":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't know enough about the future,"},"1562":{"dur":1,"text":"the economy, and our needs,"},"1563":{"dur":2,"text":"and I said, these are sophisticated people Mr. President."},"1566":{"dur":2,"text":"They're gonna understand that it's you watch"},"1568":{"dur":3,"text":"and probably your successors and that's quite a lot."},"1571":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, the decision was made and the CR club said,"},"1576":{"dur":3,"text":"this is another wimpish half measure by"},"1579":{"dur":2,"text":"an anti environment president,"},"1581":{"dur":1,"text":"and it went on like that."},"1582":{"dur":2,"text":"So at the next cabinet meeting as he was leaving"},"1585":{"dur":3,"text":"he said, did you see what the CR club said about me?"},"1588":{"dur":1,"text":"I said, what can I say?"},"1590":{"dur":2,"text":"Almost using his words even,"},"1592":{"dur":3,"text":"and he said, you know, I don't give environmentalists"},"1596":{"dur":3,"text":"everything they want but they treat me like I was Reagan,"},"1599":{"dur":2,"text":"and I remember thinking, losing him."},"1602":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah it's interesting, in my work I've done"},"1604":{"dur":1,"text":"quite a bit of work with environmentalists"},"1606":{"dur":2,"text":"and the problem with many of them in my experience is,"},"1609":{"dur":2,"text":"they're just always against things,"},"1611":{"dur":2,"text":"and they're not really for things."},"1613":{"dur":2,"text":"You told me a story as we were walking before class"},"1616":{"dur":2,"text":"about a current project you're working on to,"},"1618":{"dur":1,"text":"was it shut down a couple of coal plants,"},"1620":{"dur":1,"text":"and what's going in Texas?"},"1621":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that this is a really interesting story"},"1624":{"dur":3,"text":"about how to frame something and give the other side credit."},"1628":{"dur":2,"text":"- The environmentalists and there are"},"1630":{"dur":2,"text":"serious exceptions to it."},"1632":{"dur":2,"text":"The environmental defense fund and Fred Crupt,"},"1634":{"dur":3,"text":"I did a deal with whereby he would support our clean air act"},"1638":{"dur":2,"text":"to at least the acid rain permission,"},"1641":{"dur":3,"text":"and we would make the cap permanent,"},"1644":{"dur":2,"text":"and he would ride full support."},"1646":{"dur":1,"text":"He was as good as his word, he did,"},"1648":{"dur":3,"text":"and 10 years ago I negotiated the environmental commitments"},"1651":{"dur":1,"text":"for the largest private equity deal in history."},"1653":{"dur":4,"text":"A 45 billion dollar deal in Texas to buy Texas Utilities,"},"1658":{"dur":3,"text":"and for TBG, Goldman Sachs and the KKR,"},"1663":{"dur":1,"text":"and as it turns out,"},"1665":{"dur":3,"text":"we went in at eight dollars and a half gas price."},"1668":{"dur":3,"text":"Which determines the price of electrical

commitments I made was to cancel"},"1680":{"dur":3,"text":"the construction of eight coal fired power plants,"},"1684":{"dur":1,"text":"and that made history at the time."},"1685":{"dur":1,"text":"It's the first time that the financial community"},"1687":{"dur":2,"text":"had ever taken the environment so seriously,"},"1689":{"dur":4,"text":"and we averted 55 million tons a year of carbon dioxide."},"1696":{"dur":3,"text":"So we now have three coal fired power plants."},"1699":{"dur":3,"text":"Which are responsible for 3,500

business,"},"1714":{"dur":1,"text":"one this year, one in two years,"},"1715":{"dur":2,"text":"and one in five or six years,"},"1718":{"dur":1,"text":"we're proposing to make a

one favor as the Obama administration"},"1774":{"dur":1,"text":"goes out the door,"},"1776":{"dur":3,"text":"and so our head of our generation company goes down"},"1780":{"dur":1,"text":"to talk to the governor and talk to"},"1782":{"dur":1,"text":"the environmental officials there"},"1783":{"dur":4,"text":"and explain that the upgrades required by current air law"},"1788":{"dur":2,"text":"would be about 700 million dollars"},"1790":{"dur":1,"text":"for these three plants,"},"1791":{"dur":4,"text":"and given their value and the fact that we just acquired"},"1796":{"dur":2,"text":"3,000

trying to bring them around,"},"1807":{"dur":1,"text":"and one of the difficulties is"},"1808":{"dur":3,"text":"what does Texas say if EPA and we sweep in"},"1813":{"dur":1,"text":"and make this decision"},"1815":{"dur":3,"text":"and it looks like they've been undercut?"},"1821":{"dur":3,"text":"Well it's occurred to us that what they say is"},"1825":{"dur":4,"text":"we, Texas, solved the

say we dealt with it without"},"1854":{"dur":2,"text":"the clean power rule, without EPA,"},"1858":{"dur":3,"text":"and we've put Texas on a cleaner path"},"1861":{"dur":3,"text":"but it wasn't the federal government."},"1864":{"dur":2,"text":"That's the story, or it could be a story,"},"1867":{"dur":1,"text":"and very often if you're dealing with decisions"},"1869":{"dur":3,"text":"that have
