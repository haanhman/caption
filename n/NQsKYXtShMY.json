really"},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"quite foreign to you, realize that this is a wonderful way"},"441":{"dur":3,"text":"of gaining up some confidence with which to step into the"},"444":{"dur":1,"text":"class, like I did frankly, years ago."},"446":{"dur":1,"text":"And then have five weeks to sort of figure out for"},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"yourself if you want to stay pass\/fail, switch to a letter"},"450":{"dur":0,"text":"grade, or the like."},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"And typically what pass\/fail does, I think, for students is"},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"that, if you put in that 10 hours, 20 hours, whatever it"},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"may be on some problems, and you're banging your head"},"458":{"dur":0,"text":"against the wall."},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"And you really just can't chase something down, and you"},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"have so many other things you need to do, honestly, what I"},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"think pass\/fail is, it takes the edge off of"},"466":{"dur":1,"text":"situations like that."},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"Where you've taken the thing 90% of the way."},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, It's not quite perfect."},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"But you got a lot out of it, nonetheless."},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"So consider pass\/fail as giving you that"},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"mental model, perhaps."},"477":{"dur":3,"text":"All right, so last week we dove into Scratch, and we"},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"talked about programming on a fairly high graphical level."},"483":{"dur":1,"text":"And today we make the transition to a language"},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"called C, a lower level programming language on top of"},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"which many modern languages are now built, including some"},"491":{"dur":1,"text":"of the ones we'll be using towards term's end."},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"And syntactically, what they look like"},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"is all quite similar."},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"So let's start to make this transition here."},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"So this was a program last week that was the simplest of"},"501":{"dur":1,"text":"hello world programs."},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"It simply printed to the screen, hello world, with a"},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"little speech bubble coming out of the cat."},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"Well if we begin now to translate this to another"},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"language, realize that the ideas today and on Wednesday"},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"are identical, but the syntax starts to change."},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"So whereas last week we had, when green flag clicked, say"},"519":{"dur":0,"text":"hello world."},"520":{"dur":3,"text":"Today we're going to have, int, main, void, printf,"},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"return, with some other syntax in there as well."},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"Curly braces, and parentheses, and quotes, and whatnot."},"529":{"dur":5,"text":"But realize that the core of the idea here is the printing,"},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"and ultimately the fact that main is now going to be"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"synonymous with the starting of a program."},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"Main is going to be where the green flag kicks things off."},"544":{"dur":2,"text":"So now let's tease apart some of the building blocks here"},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"before we dive into some concrete examples."},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"So we called this a statement last week, whereby it's just"},"551":{"dur":0,"text":"an instruction."},"552":{"dur":3,"text":"Do this, in this case, say hello world."},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"Well in C, if we look at just that line, this is how we're"},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"going to start expressing that particular puzzle piece."},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"printf, quote unquote hello world, and then a semicolon."},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"And now we'll tease these apart more and more over time,"},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"but realize that there's a pattern here."},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"So one, we have this thing called printf, which is"},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"essentially analogous to the word say."},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"That's what it's going to do."},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"printf, and f here means formatted."},"577":{"dur":1,"text":"So it just means you can insert"},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"various aesthetic details."},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"So quote unquote, is the beginning of what we're going"},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"to start calling a string."},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"A word, a phrase, a sentence."},"587":{"dur":3,"text":"A string in a programming language is a sequence of zero"},"590":{"dur":1,"text":"or more characters."},"591":{"dur":3,"text":"So h-e-l-l-o comma and so forth, is"},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"quote unquote, a string."},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"And now backslash n, a little syntactically odd, but we"},"598":{"dur":3,"text":"already defined that last week as meaning what?"},"601":{"dur":0,"text":"It's just a new line."},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"It's just a way of conveying to the computer you want the"},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"equivalent of hitting the Enter there, but you don't"},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"want to actually hit Enter and therefore mess up all of the"},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"formatting of your actual program."},"612":{"dur":3,"text":"Now the parentheses enclose this string, open paren and"},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"close paren, and inside of that is our string."},"618":{"dur":4,"text":"Because that's because in C, and other programming"},"622":{"dur":4,"text":"languages, things like printf take arguments, or take"},"627":{"dur":0,"text":"parameters."},"628":{"dur":3,"text":"So start thinking now of this purple say block as a"},"631":{"dur":3,"text":"function, as a method, as a procedure."},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"You can really call it whatever you want for now, but"},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"it's sort of a miniature program that only does one"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"thing, in a single line, no less."},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"So printf is also what we're going to start calling a"},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"function, and functions do something-- in this case"},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"prints a formatted string to the screen--"},"649":{"dur":3,"text":"but functions also take arguments or parameters."},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"And by arguments or parameters, thank you, we mean"},"655":{"dur":5,"text":"that their behavior can be influenced by what you pass in"},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"inside of the parentheses."},"663":{"dur":3,"text":"So in this case printf needs be told what to print, and we"},"666":{"dur":3,"text":"just pass in, in double quotes here, the string that we"},"669":{"dur":1,"text":"actually want to print."},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"And the semicolon on the very end of this line, is just a"},"674":{"dur":3,"text":"historical nuisance whereby at the end of most lines of code,"},"678":{"dur":3,"text":"you put a semicolon to make super clear to the computer"},"681":{"dur":1,"text":"that this line of code ends here."},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"Now this is good because, as we'll see as programs get more"},"685":{"dur":3,"text":"complex, the semicolon will make super clear to us humans,"},"689":{"dur":3,"text":"and also the computer, where lines of code start and end."},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"Realize that some languages don't have some"},"694":{"dur":0,"text":"of these same details."},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"And in fact, in JavaScript you don't always need something"},"697":{"dur":0,"text":"like the semicolon."},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"But more on that to come."},"700":{"dur":0,"text":"So loops."},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"We had something like this, very intuitively, obvious, do"},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"something again and again and again."},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"Like putting on socks, or saying hello, in this case."},"707":{"dur":3,"text":"Well starting today in C, we could express this Scratch"},"711":{"dur":3,"text":"block as, while true printf hello world."},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"So notice we're starting to build on literally the puzzle"},"717":{"dur":0,"text":"piece from before."},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"We have the same purple block, but it's inside of this"},"721":{"dur":3,"text":"bracketed forever block, and the best way to translate that"},"724":{"dur":1,"text":"to C is as follows."},"726":{"dur":1,"text":"There's no forever keyword."},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"You can't just type f-o-r-e-v-e-r in C."},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"So the closest analog is while."},"733":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, while true seems a little stupid because does the value"},"737":{"dur":1,"text":"of true ever change?"},"738":{"dur":1,"text":"Presumably not."},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"It's like saying while one, while on, while true."},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"It's all the same thing, true is always the case."},"745":{"dur":4,"text":"So this loop is actually inducing what kind of loop?"},"749":{"dur":1,"text":"Just an infinite loop, right."},"751":{"dur":1,"text":"A forever loop or as we called it last week,"},"752":{"dur":0,"text":"just an infinite loop."},"753":{"dur":1,"text":"So sometimes that's bad."},"755":{"dur":1,"text":"Sometimes that's a bug, sometimes that's why you get"},"757":{"dur":2,"text":"the spinning beach ball or hourglass, or the like."},"759":{"dur":1,"text":"But in this case, we deliberately, for whatever"},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"reason, wanted to print the same thing again"},"763":{"dur":1,"text":"Or in the case of like a watch, you want to do"},"765":{"dur":1,"text":"something again and again and again."},"767":{"dur":1,"text":"So infinite loops might make sense."},"769":{"dur":4,"text":"And this is how in C we might translate forever to code."},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"So now this one's a little more specific."},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"We had repeat 10 times the following statement."},"778":{"dur":3,"text":"So while true doesn't quite work there, because true is"},"782":{"dur":1,"text":"always true."},"783":{"dur":3,"text":"So if we instead look at the C version, now the syntax gets a"},"787":{"dur":1,"text":"little more cryptic."},"788":{"dur":3,"text":"But to be honest once you start to see this, it all gets"},"791":{"dur":1,"text":"pretty familiar quickly."},"792":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is what's called a for loop."},"794":{"dur":2,"text":"A for loop is going to tell the computer to do something"},"797":{"dur":3,"text":"again and again and again, for as long as"},"800":{"dur":1,"text":"these things are true."},"801":{"dur":1,"text":"Now what do we mean by that?"},"803":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, there's three parts to a for loop, and we're going to"},"805":{"dur":2,"text":"come back to this in context of actual"},"808":{"dur":0,"text":"examples in a moment."},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"So don't worry if it doesn't quite sink in all at once."},"811":{"dur":3,"text":"But int i equals 0, is long story short, saying give me a"},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"variable that's of type integer, so give me a number"},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"called i, and initialize it to 0."},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"That is give me like an algebraic variable x and"},"823":{"dur":1,"text":"initialize it to 0."},"824":{"dur":1,"text":"But in this case we called it i."},"826":{"dur":2,"text":"Then in the middle, it says i is less than 10."},"829":{"dur":3,"text":"That's telling the computer, do the following stuff so long"},"832":{"dur":1,"text":"as i is less than 10."},"833":{"dur":1,"text":"And obviously it starts less than 10 because"},"835":{"dur":1,"text":"it starts at 0."},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"Then lastly, you can perhaps guess what i ++ means."},"839":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a little bit of syntax that just means increment i."},"842":{"dur":3,"text":"So add 1 to i, again and again and again."},"845":{"dur":3,"text":"And so as we'll see this loop, this syntax rather, implements"},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"precisely the same thing, that frankly in Scratch was just so"},"852":{"dur":1,"text":"much easier to express."},"853":{"dur":1,"text":"Repeat 10, and you're done."},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"In C, and in most programming languages, we have to be a"},"857":{"dur":2,"text":"little more instructive for the computer and actually"},"860":{"dur":1,"text":"specify something like this."},"861":{"dur":2,"text":"But we'll come back to this and other syntax."},"863":{"dur":1,"text":"What about variables?"},"864":{"dur":2,"text":"In Scratch we had something like these orange blocks,"},"866":{"dur":1,"text":"where I could declare a variable."},"868":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's arbitrarily call it counter."},"870":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's initialize it to 0, and then"},"871":{"dur":1,"text":"let's forever do something."},"873":{"dur":2,"text":"In this case in Scratch I'm saying the counter, so the"},"875":{"dur":2,"text":"cat's going to have a little speech bubble that's speaking"},"878":{"dur":1,"text":"the number that's in this variable."},"880":{"dur":2,"text":"And then we have change counter by 1."},"882":{"dur":3,"text":"So all of this is wrapped inside of a forever lock."},"885":{"dur":3,"text":"So we already now have the building blocks in C with"},"888":{"dur":1,"text":"which to translate this."},"890":{"dur":1,"text":"One way we could do

creating a what?"},"2922":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's creating a string called s."},"2924":{"dur":1,"text":"Now what does that really mean?"},"2926":{"dur":5,"text":"Well it's reserving space for a

come"},"2964":{"dur":2,"text":"we'll actually pull back the layer that is string, and"},"2967":{"dur":1,"text":"we'll tell you what it really is."},"2968":{"dur":2,"text":"String for now is just a

letters"},"3019":{"dur":1,"text":"each time at the keyboard."},"3020":{"dur":2,"text":"So what does GetString do ultimately?"},"3023":{"dur":1,"text":"Think of it as this little black box."},"3025":{"dur":4,"text":"And this black box takes no input, but when you bang on"},"3029":{"dur":3,"text":"it, it spits out a string that the user has typed in."},"3033":{"dur":3,"text":"And the fact that there's an equal sign there means, take"},"3036":{"dur":3,"text":"what is spit out on the right, and store it inside"},"3039":{"dur":1,"text":"what's on the left."},"3041":{"dur":2,"text":"So equal sign here, it actually doesn't mean"},"3043":{"dur":3,"text":"equality, it rather technically means assignment."},"3046":{"dur":2,"text":"Take the value on the right, and put it in the"},"3049":{"dur":1,"text":"variable on the left."},"3051":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's all that's happening there."},"3052":{"dur":2,"text":"Now in line seven, we're calling printf."},"3055":{"dur":2,"text":"So printf hopefully is getting a little boring by now."},"3058":{"dur":1,"text":"So print a formatted string."},"3059":{"dur":0,"text":"What string?"},"3060":{"dur":5,"text":"Print out, quote unquote, h-e-l-l-o, comma, %s,"},"3065":{"dur":2,"text":"exclamation point, new line."},"3067":{"dur":2,"text":"All right, so what do I want to plug-in for %s?"},"3070":{"dur":2,"text":"Literally whatever is stored in s."},"3072":{"dur":2,"text":"So in this case, little sanity check, how many arguments does"},"3075":{"dur":1,"text":"printf take?"},"3079":{"dur":1,"text":"OK I heard one."},"3083":{"dur":2,"text":"I heard one again."},"3086":{"dur":1,"text":"Two, I heard two."},"3087":{"dur":2,"text":"And how about three?"},"3089":{"dur":0,"text":"OK, three?"},"3090":{"dur":2,"text":"Three possible answers, only one of them is correct."},"3093":{"dur":3,"text":"So arguments again influence the behavior of a function."},"3096":{"dur":2,"text":"In the past printf did only take one argument."},"3099":{"dur":2,"text":"Quote unquote, hello world was a single argument."},"3102":{"dur":2,"text":"However now, notice where this comma is."},"3105":{"dur":4,"text":"This comma is outside of the quote unquote, which means,"},"3109":{"dur":2,"text":"hey printf, here comes a second argument."},"3112":{"dur":2,"text":"So commas in most programming languages"},"3114":{"dur":3,"text":"separate multiple arguments."},"3117":{"dur":2,"text":"So the answer here is definitely not one, because"},"3119":{"dur":0,"text":"there is this comma."},"3120":{"dur":3,"text":"So minimally, printf is apparently taking two"},"3123":{"dur":1,"text":"arguments this time."},"3124":{"dur":2,"text":"But the opportunity for a trick question here is what"},"3127":{"dur":3,"text":"Does this imply that there's actually three arguments?"},"3131":{"dur":2,"text":"This, this, and this."},"3133":{"dur":5,"text":"So no, because that comma, is inside of the quotes, which"},"3138":{"dur":2,"text":"means it's really just an aesthetic of English."},"3140":{"dur":2,"text":"It has nothing to do with the number of"},"3143":{"dur":1,"text":"arguments in this program."},"3144":{"dur":2,"text":"So this comma is outside of the double quotes."},"3147":{"dur":1,"text":"And then return 0."},"3148":{"dur":2,"text":"For now let's just sort of take this one on faith for"},"3150":{"dur":3,"text":"today, and just know that when functions are done executing"},"3154":{"dur":3,"text":"lines of code, they should generally return some value."},"3157":{"dur":4,"text":"In this case, just because main must return in
