what"},"441":{"dur":4,"text":"I do as a wilderness guide,\nso it makes any kind of sense."},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"We take people out into nature."},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's usually\npeople that have"},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"gone through some pretty\nsignificant change"},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"in their lives,\nand they want to,"},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"somehow-- they can't be\nwho they were before."},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"So some kind of--\noften, a little trauma."},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"It might have been a divorce."},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"It might have been\na loss of somebody."},"465":{"dur":3,"text":"And they come to sit out\non the earth by themselves,"},"469":{"dur":3,"text":"and basically remove\nthemselves, and go back"},"472":{"dur":1,"text":"with a new

out."},"479":{"dur":4,"text":"And they're alone, and they\ndon't have a lot of shelter."},"483":{"dur":4,"text":"So they're really out in the\nnatural world by themselves."},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"Who does this kind of thing?"},"490":{"dur":3,"text":"People, usually, that are\ngoing through something"},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"that we call a growth crisis."},"496":{"dur":4,"text":"And when I was diagnosed with\ncancer, that was my question--"},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"can cancer be a growth crisis?"},"504":{"dur":4,"text":"Because one of the things that\nI realized right away when I got"},"508":{"dur":4,"text":"diagnosed, is that my\nlife irrevocably changed."},"513":{"dur":1,"text":"It's something,\nin the wilderness"},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"work, that we call severance."},"517":{"dur":5,"text":"It's, like, the moment when life\nis over, the way you knew it."},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"And you know that you\ncan never, ever go back."},"524":{"dur":3,"text":"You cannot step\nback over that line."},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's very true for\nour ceremony in nature."},"530":{"dur":5,"text":"And I found to be very true\nin my own cancer journey."},"536":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I had this question\nfor myself-- could cancer"},"540":{"dur":6,"text":"be an initiation, instead of\njust something horrible that"},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"happened?"},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"Could there be any\ngoodness in it?"},"550":{"dur":3,"text":"Could it somehow prepare\nus for something bigger?"},"553":{"dur":5,"text":"And so I'm going to look at\nwhat does it mean, initiation."},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going to go with some\nquotes from Michael Meade, who"},"561":{"dur":6,"text":"is a really big name in\nwilderness rites of passage."},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"He says, \"Initiatory\nevents are those"},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"that mark a man\nor a woman's life"},"572":{"dur":4,"text":"forever, that pull a person\ndeeper into life than they"},"576":{"dur":3,"text":"would normally choose to go.\""},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"Is that true for cancer?"},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"I would think so."},"585":{"dur":4,"text":"\"Initiatory events are those\nthat define who a person is,"},"590":{"dur":3,"text":"or cause some power\nto erupt from them,"},"593":{"dur":4,"text":"or strip everything from\nthem until all that is left"},"597":{"dur":3,"text":"is their essential self.\""},"601":{"dur":0,"text":"That sound familiar?"},"604":{"dur":0,"text":"Maybe?"},"608":{"dur":3,"text":"\"In initiation a\nperson becomes no one"},"611":{"dur":3,"text":"before becoming someone again.\""},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"Again, does that\napply to cancer?"},"617":{"dur":1,"text":"It certainly felt\nthat way, when I"},"619":{"dur":4,"text":"was at the bottom of my\ncauldron, during chemotherapy."},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"So life, really, is\ninitiating us all the time."},"626":{"dur":3,"text":"It's just that sometimes\nwe do certain ceremonies"},"630":{"dur":4,"text":"to acknowledge it, and other\ntimes life actually comes in."},"634":{"dur":4,"text":"So I do think that cancer\nreally can be a rite of passage,"},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"and that if we look\nat it in that way,"},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"it can actually be an\ninvitation to come alive."},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"So for that to make a\nlittle bit more sense,"},"650":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm going to talk about the\nthree-stage model of rites"},"653":{"dur":7,"text":"of passage, and to see how that\nactually applies to cancer."},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"I already spoke a little\nbit about severance,"},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"which is the moment\nwhen life changes."},"665":{"dur":1,"text":"And there are other\nexamples-- which"},"667":{"dur":3,"text":"is death of a loved one,\nmarriage, divorce, trauma,"},"670":{"dur":0,"text":"sickness."},"671":{"dur":3,"text":"In our cancer world, it would\nbe diagnosis-- the moment"},"675":{"dur":3,"text":"that we lose our old life."},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"And then there is the\nthreshold, which is"},"680":{"dur":3,"text":"the time in the liminal world."},"683":{"dur":3,"text":"Some call it the hero or\nthe heroine's journey,"},"687":{"dur":5,"text":"the in-between place,\nthe underworld cauldron,"},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"ceremony of any sort."},"694":{"dur":3,"text":"A place where you really\ncannot see in the dark."},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"You have to feel\nyour way through."},"700":{"dur":4,"text":"In the cancer world, we\ncreate that with treatment."},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"And then there's\nreincorporation,"},"707":{"dur":5,"text":"which is reemerging as a new\nperson in the world-- rebirth,"},"712":{"dur":5,"text":"sharing, and airing of gifts,\nrenewal, manifestation,"},"717":{"dur":3,"text":"marking a new life,\ntrue maturity."},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"And that would be survivorship."},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"That's the place where\nwe all sit today."},"727":{"dur":4,"text":"It's the potential\nof what we get"},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"to live into, after\nhaving encountered cancer."},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"So ta da-- we 're here."},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"Survivorship!"},"739":{"dur":6,"text":"And it's interesting to\nnote that survivorship often"},"745":{"dur":1,"text":"seems to be the hardest part."},"747":{"dur":3,"text":"Not when we're diagnosed,\nbut looking back,"},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"it seems like treatment\nwas, relatively,"},"753":{"dur":3,"text":"a time of great support-- the\ntime where we could just let"},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"go into it, and just did\nour best to get through."},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"But that living\nit forward ends up"},"763":{"dur":3,"text":"being the hardest part\nof the whole journey."},"766":{"dur":3,"text":"And so that's what we're\ngoing to explore tonight."},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"And so the first\nthing I want to do"},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"is go back to that\nvery first slide,"},"773":{"dur":3,"text":"and talk about\nmessage number one."},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"We are forever changed\nthrough cancer."},"779":{"dur":1,"text":"So what does it mean?"},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"What does it mean to\nbe forever changed?"},"783":{"dur":3,"text":"I think our culture\nhas very little concept"},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"for people changing."},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"We are on a very\nlinear trajectory,"},"793":{"dur":3,"text":"where you set out something, and\nthen that's where you're going."},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"And people do not\nlike you to change."},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"People also are\nnot really taught"},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"that death is at all a part."},"805":{"dur":4,"text":"Death, leaving, doesn't really\nhave a place in our culture."},"809":{"dur":5,"text":"So if you are touched by that\nin any way, shape or form,"},"814":{"dur":3,"text":"they get very uncomfortable."},"817":{"dur":4,"text":"And family and friends\noften can't understand why"},"822":{"dur":1,"text":"we don't come back to normal."},"823":{"dur":2,"text":"And I hear this all the time--\npeople saying, you know,"},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"my yoga group is the\nonly place where I"},"827":{"dur":2,"text":"can feel like I'm really heard."},"830":{"dur":3,"text":"Or I'm going to my support\ngroup, and they get it,"},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"but my old friends still don't."},"836":{"dur":1,"text":"Everybody is waiting,\nafter treatment,"},"838":{"dur":5,"text":"that I get back to be normal,\nand I just cannot do it."},"843":{"dur":3,"text":"So in a way, there is, like,\na death that we're grieving."},"847":{"dur":3,"text":"We're grieving our old self,\nwhich we may or may not"},"850":{"dur":3,"text":"be as fully, or we are\ninhabiting our lives"},"854":{"dur":2,"text":"differently as survivors."},"856":{"dur":2,"text":"And then there is the\ndeath that our parents,"},"859":{"dur":3,"text":"that our lovers,\nsometimes our children,"},"862":{"dur":4,"text":"experience in us having changed,\nif they're not ready to give up"},"867":{"dur":1,"text":"who we were before."},"868":{"dur":3,"text":"So a lot of friction."},"871":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think, just\nas an example of how"},"876":{"dur":2,"text":"it used to be, when we were\nliving a little bit more"},"878":{"dur":3,"text":"cyclically in more\nindigenous cultures,"},"882":{"dur":2,"text":"there was more of a\nsense that you are moving"},"884":{"dur":1,"text":"through certain\nphases in your life,"},"886":{"dur":2,"text":"and that they were acknowledged\nwithin your community,"},"889":{"dur":1,"text":"and within your family."},"891":{"dur":2,"text":"That, for example, young\nboys at a certain age,"},"894":{"dur":2,"text":"when they were ready\nfor initiation--"},"896":{"dur":3,"text":"young boys were taken\nfrom their mothers' homes,"},"900":{"dur":1,"text":"and they were dragged, at night."},"902":{"dur":2,"text":"There were men, sometimes\nthey would be in masks,"},"904":{"dur":1,"text":"and they would drag the\nboy away from the hut."},"906":{"dur":3,"text":"And the mothers would wail,\nand say, don't take him."},"909":{"dur":2,"text":"And then they would go\non their little ritual,"},"911":{"dur":1,"text":"and they would come\nback, days later."},"913":{"dur":2,"text":"And the boy had a new\nstanding in the village,"},"916":{"dur":2,"text":"and the mothers had\ndone their grieving."},"918":{"dur":1,"text":"And from that moment\non, that young man"},"920":{"dur":4,"text":"was carrying a new name,\nand living in a new way,"},"924":{"dur":4,"text":"acknowledged by everybody\nthat they were a new person."},"928":{"dur":2,"text":"We've lost that in our culture."},"930":{"dur":6,"text":"It's not a concept that\nis familiar anymore."},"937":{"dur":4,"text":"So I want to use this\nconcept, called the Four"},"942":{"dur":3,"text":"Shields of Human Nature, to\ntalk about the different gifts"},"946":{"dur":5,"text":"and challenges in each of\nour pieces of ourselves."},"951":{"dur":4,"text":"So the four shields-- without\ngoing into a lot of detail,"},"955":{"dur":2,"text":"they're basically\nlike a road map."},"957":{"dur":4,"text":"They're coming from

an\nimage that really evokes it,"},"1007":{"dur":5,"text":"without me having to\ntalk a lot about it."},"1012":{"dur":4,"text":"So you can really feel\ninto that little

begins."},"1698":{"dur":3,"text":"It's how can I share\nwhat I brought out"},"1702":{"dur":1,"text":"from the cancer\njourney, and somehow"},"1704":{"dur":1,"text":"be in the world with that?"},"1705":{"dur":2,"text":"What's the legacy I\nwant to do for myself?"},"1707":{"dur":2,"text":"Like, I know for me,\nI was stuck in a job"},"1710":{"dur":2,"text":"that I had outgrown\na long

things"},"1808":{"dur":3,"text":"that I often use\nas a metaphor is"},"1811":{"dur":5,"text":"that when we turn into\nour healing after cancer,"},"1817":{"dur":2,"text":"it's as if we move from\nthe practice of our living"},"1820":{"dur":2,"text":"to the practice of\nour living and dying."},"1823":{"dur":2,"text":"And they're no longer separate."},"1825":{"dur":3,"text":"There is a sense,

going\nto get a recurrence?"},"2737":{"dur":3,"text":"I think-- so the question was,\nhow do we all deal with that?"},"2741":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think the biggest thing\nis to lose the illusion

gentle with ourselves,"},"2764":{"dur":4,"text":"and to truly know that\nthis is our own fear."},"2768":{"dur":7,"text":"It is that trauma, and we have\nto parent it in ourselves."},"2775":{"dur":2,"text":"Not to make it\nwrong, not to push it"},"2778":{"dur":4,"text":"away, but to just over and over,\nsay, yes, I know this is hard."},"2782":{"dur":3,"text":"And there is no safety."},"2785":{"dur":2,"text":"And there are times--\nI can tell for myself,"},"2788":{"dur":3,"text":"that there are times I'm really\nflying high in my

it."},"2806":{"dur":3,"text":"And so again, there's power\nin acknowledging what's here,"},"2809":{"dur":1,"text":"and partnering it."},"2811":{"dur":2,"text":"I think, as we work with\nit, at some point we"},"2813":{"dur":2,"text":"don't identify with it as much."},"2816":{"dur":2,"text":"But we learn how\nto partner it more."},"2819":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think it's a\nlifelong learning

anyone,"},"2835":{"dur":2,"text":"but we are living on the edge."},"2838":{"dur":2,"text":"But because of that,\nlike the gentleman said,"},"2840":{"dur":2,"text":"we're also living on the edge\nof our becoming, all the time."},"2843":{"dur":2,"text":"Ta da!"},"2845":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's the gift."},"2847":{"dur":2,"text":"But I think-- and\njust one more thing."},"2850":{"dur":3,"text":"So the thing is, really,\nthat we can't go back."},"2854":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think we suffer more when\nwe try to be where we're not,"},"2858":{"dur":2,"text":"or who we are not anymore."},"2861":{"dur":1,"text":"That's when it's really hard."},"2862":{"dur":5,"text":"It's like, if whatever we've\nlost, that in our new life"},"2867":{"dur":2,"text":"isn't
