are\nthose moments where"},"44":{"dur":1,"text":"we get really stuck\nin our thinking."},"46":{"dur":1,"text":"And we all do."},"47":{"dur":1,"text":"And we see things a certain way."},"49":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's very difficult for\nus to see other possibilities."},"53":{"dur":3,"text":"Or those times when we just\nkind of resist new ideas"},"56":{"dur":4,"text":"or doing

might be sad that I\nhadn't seen this before."},"107":{"dur":3,"text":"I might even be angry."},"110":{"dur":0,"text":"But then I grow."},"114":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you were to recall\na time in your life"},"116":{"dur":3,"text":"when maybe somebody\nsaid something to you"},"120":{"dur":1,"text":"that changed your life."},"121":{"dur":2,"text":"What was it they said that\ntruly made you see

mean, maybe it was a parent."},"132":{"dur":3,"text":"Maybe it was a teacher that\nmade you raise your hand."},"135":{"dur":1,"text":"Or that grumpy\nneighbor that made"},"136":{"dur":2,"text":"you realize you\nwere being a jerk."},"139":{"dur":6,"text":"Or a sports coach, a friend,\nmaybe it even was a manager."},"146":{"dur":1,"text":"What did they say?"},"147":{"dur":4,"text":"And, really, in that\nmoment, how did you feel?"},"151":{"dur":2,"text":"I've been asking this\nquestion my leadership classes"},"154":{"dur":1,"text":"for over a decade."},"155":{"dur":2,"text":"And they always say it\nwas that person who really"},"158":{"dur":2,"text":"saw me, who really\nunderstood me."},"161":{"dur":5,"text":"And also knew how I was\nholding myself back."},"166":{"dur":1,"text":"And then they always\nsay that, yeah, they"},"168":{"dur":3,"text":"said something that challenged\nme in a way that in the moment,"},"171":{"dur":2,"text":"it didn't feel good."},"174":{"dur":1,"text":"But it made a difference to me."},"176":{"dur":3,"text":"And from that\nmoment, I saw myself"},"179":{"dur":1,"text":"and the world differently."},"183":{"dur":4,"text":"And these people aren't\nalways people that we like."},"187":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact, I had this boss."},"189":{"dur":3,"text":"He was not even near the top of\nmy list of most-liked bosses,"},"193":{"dur":2,"text":"more close to the bottom."},"196":{"dur":2,"text":"We always fought about ideas."},"199":{"dur":3,"text":"And when my projects would take\noff, and I'd be successful,"},"202":{"dur":4,"text":"somehow he got credit\nfor the success."},"206":{"dur":1,"text":"And in the five years\nI worked for him,"},"208":{"dur":3,"text":"he never pronounced\nmy name correctly,"},"211":{"dur":1,"text":"even though I always\nsaid, it's Marcia."},"216":{"dur":4,"text":"But he still had this way\nof hearing me, of seeing me."},"220":{"dur":4,"text":"He knew what really\ndrove me, what"},"224":{"dur":1,"text":"motivated me to move forward."},"225":{"dur":4,"text":"But he also knew how I\nwas holding myself back."},"230":{"dur":3,"text":"And he say these things that\nwould make me stop and really"},"233":{"dur":4,"text":"evaluate what I was\nreally doing in a way"},"238":{"dur":1,"text":"that I could see\nthings differently."},"240":{"dur":3,"text":"Like, for example,\nthere was this time"},"243":{"dur":3,"text":"that I was complaining\nabout the executive staff."},"247":{"dur":4,"text":"And they had re-prioritized my\nproject down the list again."},"251":{"dur":1,"text":"And I was so angry."},"253":{"dur":5,"text":"And how come they couldn't\nsee why this was so important?"},"259":{"dur":4,"text":"And he says to me, you know,\nyou can quit fighting now."},"263":{"dur":1,"text":"You've made it."},"267":{"dur":1,"text":"What do you mean?"},"269":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, as we were talking\nabout before we started,"},"272":{"dur":1,"text":"I am a small woman."},"273":{"dur":3,"text":"And this was a semiconductor\ncompany, primarily men."},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"And I had to fight my way up."},"278":{"dur":2,"text":"Fighting had served me."},"281":{"dur":3,"text":"Who would I be if\nI wasn't a fighter?"},"285":{"dur":3,"text":"But then he said,\ndo you think there's"},"288":{"dur":3,"text":"a way instead of trying to\nforce them to see what you want,"},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"that you can inspire\nthem to see what you see?"},"298":{"dur":3,"text":"I really valued people\nwho inspired me."},"302":{"dur":1,"text":"And I really thought\nI could do that,"},"304":{"dur":3,"text":"that I did that with the\npeople who worked for me."},"307":{"dur":3,"text":"I had never thought that I\ncould do that with these people."},"311":{"dur":1,"text":"Why not?"},"312":{"dur":3,"text":"But I couldn't see it\nuntil he made the statement"},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"and asked the question, which\nthen changed my behavior,"},"319":{"dur":2,"text":"and changed my results."},"321":{"dur":1,"text":"Then there was this\nother time I was"},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"complaining about my coworkers."},"325":{"dur":1,"text":"Seems like I complained\nan awful lot."},"329":{"dur":1,"text":"But we were doing this project."},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was saying, they\nweren't pulling their weight."},"333":{"dur":6,"text":"And he says to me, wow, it seems\nas if everyone disappoints you."},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"Again, I paused."},"344":{"dur":3,"text":"And he says to me, do you\nthink anyone will ever"},"348":{"dur":1,"text":"be good enough for you?"},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"And I thought about\nthat for days."},"354":{"dur":3,"text":"And I realized it was actually\nthe source of all my troubles"},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"with all my relationships."},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"So it wasn't even\nwork that he changed."},"363":{"dur":3,"text":"But he totally changed my\nlife with one reflection,"},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"one question."},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"And so when I looked\nat that, I thought,"},"372":{"dur":3,"text":"was this just random statements\nof this uncensored boss?"},"378":{"dur":2,"text":"So when I left that\ncompany, I went out."},"380":{"dur":1,"text":"I was trained as a coach."},"382":{"dur":3,"text":"And I had gotten involved\nwith emotional intelligence."},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was fascinated\nby the brain."},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I went on to do my\ndoctoral work in psychology"},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"just to really learn at\nwhat are we learning now"},"392":{"dur":4,"text":"that we have access to really\nseeing how the brain works?"},"397":{"dur":4,"text":"And my second master's was\nin learning psychology."},"401":{"dur":1,"text":"That was decades ago."},"403":{"dur":3,"text":"And now I realize what we\nthought then of how we learned"},"406":{"dur":3,"text":"is very different now, that\nthere's different learning."},"409":{"dur":1,"text":"So what I want to\nshare with you today,"},"411":{"dur":3,"text":"briefly I want to look\nat what type of learning"},"414":{"dur":1,"text":"are we talking about?"},"415":{"dur":3,"text":"If you really want to change\npeople's behavior, particularly"},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"when they're stuck\nor they're resistant,"},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"how do you actually do that?"},"423":{"dur":1,"text":"So we're going to\nlook at what is it"},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"the conditions you're\ntrying to create?"},"427":{"dur":1,"text":"And then I also\nwant to look at how"},"429":{"dur":4,"text":"do you know what to say that's\ngoing to make them see things"},"433":{"dur":3,"text":"differently and then\nchange their life?"},"437":{"dur":3,"text":"So when we look at\nlearning-- I said to you"},"440":{"dur":3,"text":"that I learned early on\nthat there was a way that we"},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"can help people to\nlearn information."},"447":{"dur":4,"text":"But the problem with just\nusing the thinking brain"},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"is that we're competing\nwith a whole lot of things."},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"So if I tell you, I really\nthink you should do this,"},"457":{"dur":1,"text":"you might say, yeah, great."},"458":{"dur":0,"text":"And you write it down."},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"But then how many things\ncompete with that?"},"462":{"dur":1,"text":"And within five,\n10 minutes, you've"},"464":{"dur":4,"text":"probably forgotten\nwhat I've said."},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"So even reading things,\nhow many articles"},"471":{"dur":1,"text":"do you read online a day?"},"472":{"dur":1,"text":"At the end of the\nday, if I asked you,"},"474":{"dur":5,"text":"what did you learn today, would\nyou even remember most of it?"},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, all those tests\nyou took in school you"},"481":{"dur":0,"text":"had to memorize things."},"482":{"dur":3,"text":"And if I gave it to you\nnow, would you pass?"},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"Because this is short-term\nmemory we're dealing with."},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"And, in fact, if you want\npeople to remember then"},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"it's got to have a\nstrong emotion attached"},"493":{"dur":1,"text":"to the information."},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"They have to say, wow!"},"495":{"dur":0,"text":"This is fabulous!"},"496":{"dur":1,"text":"This is going to\nbe great for me."},"498":{"dur":3,"text":"It's going to truly help\nme achieve my goals."},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"If they don't, it's\nnot going to embed."},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"They won't remember it."},"505":{"dur":4,"text":"It has to be a big\nimpact in order for it"},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"to get into long-term memory."},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"So information-based\nlearning, and just telling"},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"people what to do is\nreally an inefficient way"},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"of getting them to change."},"519":{"dur":3,"text":"So then we have the traditional\nold management technique"},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"is I'll scare you\ninto changing, right?"},"526":{"dur":1,"text":"And people still do this."},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"You better do this, or else."},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"The problem with this is\nthat fear-based learning"},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"gets lodged back here where\nwe learn automatic pilot"},"537":{"dur":1,"text":"stuff, the motor skills."},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"Like you learn how\nto drive a car."},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"How many of you drive?"},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"So how often do you\ndrive, and you've"},"545":{"dur":3,"text":"been driving for,\noh, gosh, miles,"},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"and you realize you haven't\nthought about driving?"},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"Raise your hand if this\nhas ever happened to you."},"553":{"dur":0,"text":"Look around."},"554":{"dur":4,"text":"You're driving on the road\nwith all these people."},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"Thank God for automatic\npilot, that we"},"562":{"dur":1,"text":"can do this without thinking."},"564":{"dur":3,"text":"But that's the thing, if\nI learned based on fear,"},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"then it gets lodged there."},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"And I learn to do\nthings one way."},"570":{"dur":4,"text":"And it no longer has access\nto my long-term memory"},"574":{"dur":3,"text":"and my creative source."},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"So I learn how to do things."},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"And under pressure, I'm really\ngood at doing things one way."},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"But then you ask me to adapt\nand do things differently."},"585":{"dur":0,"text":"And you know what?"},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"I can't."},"587":{"dur":3,"text":"It's very hard for me to\nthen change the way I do it."},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"Because I learned it under fear."},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"It's almost as if\nI have to learn"},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"an entirely new way\nof doing things."},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"And then people wonder,\nwhy are these people"},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"so resistant to change?"},"603":{"dur":3,"text":"Because they learned under\nfear In the first place."},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is also a\nvery inefficient way"},"609":{"dur":4,"text":"of teaching people, and getting\nthem to change their behavior."},"613":{"dur":4,"text":"So the third way that we have\nto change people's behavior"},"617":{"dur":3,"text":"actually works with\nthe middle brain,"},"620":{"dur":4,"text":"where we have long-term\nmemory, and we can be creative."},"625":{"dur":3,"text":"But there's a structure here\nthat is really important."},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is the\nmost important thing"},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"in changing someone's\nbehavior, especially"},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"if it has to do with\nhow I relate to others."},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"And this thing is called ego."},"638":{"dur":1,"text":"And ego isn't bad."},"640":{"dur":5,"text":"Ego is how I see myself\nand the world around me."},"646":{"dur":1,"text":"And I need this\nbecause I can't be"},"647":{"dur":3,"text":"stopping all day long\nand saying, who am I?"},"651":{"dur":1,"text":"Where am I?"},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"I have to kind of\nknow who I am and what"},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"I do so I can function."},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's a survival process."},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"So all of our experiences,\nand our beliefs,"},"662":{"dur":4,"text":"they create these frames\nthat we operate by."},"666":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, the brain\ndearly protects this."},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"This is why when people feel a\nlittle threatened of who I am--"},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"are you threatening me?"},"674":{"dur":3,"text":"Are you judging me\nor my credibility?"},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"I get defensive right away."},"680":{"dur":4,"text":"And if I say, oh, don't be\nso defensive, what happens?"},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"You get even more defensive."},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"Because we dearly protect this."},"690":{"dur":3,"text":"But, you see, when you're\ndealing with someone, the best"},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"thing you can do,\nthen, is can you"},"696":{"dur":4,"text":"break down one of those\ndefenses to where I actually"},"701":{"dur":3,"text":"stop and think about,\nis how I see myself"},"704":{"dur":5,"text":"in this situation really serving\nme and how I see the world?"},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"So what we're trying\nto do in order"},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"to change people's\nbehavior is we have"},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"what's called\ninsight-based learning."},"718":{"dur":4,"text":"So when my boss said to me,\nwill anyone ever be good enough"},"722":{"dur":4,"text":"for you, it's like, boom, he\nbroke through that defense,"},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"got right into my brain."},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"And my brain had\nto stop and go, oh,"},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"wow, what you thought was true\nmaybe isn't, maybe something"},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"So it starts rewiring."},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"And all of a sudden, I\nhave a new awareness of,"},"739":{"dur":3,"text":"I wasn't really doing a\ngood thing for myself."},"743":{"dur":3,"text":"And my view of myself and the\nworld then changed forever."},"746":{"dur":4,"text":"What's really wonderful about\nthis is once that changes,"},"751":{"dur":3,"text":"that structure,\nthen my perspective"},"755":{"dur":1,"text":"changes forever as well."},"756":{"dur":1,"text":"And so does my behavior."},"758":{"dur":3,"text":"So self-directed,\ndiscovery-based learning"},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"is permanent."},"763":{"dur":3,"text":"So I don't necessarily go\nback to old bad behavior."},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"So when we're dealing with\npeople, especially when they're"},"769":{"dur":4,"text":"resistant or they're stuck,\nthis is the most efficient way"},"773":{"dur":1,"text":"of helping them to learn."},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's why I'm\nsharing this with you."},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"That's what you're aiming for."},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"So behavior learning\ncould be that you"},"781":{"dur":1,"text":"tell me something\nthat totally supports"},"783":{"dur":1,"text":"how I see myself in the world."},"784":{"dur":1,"text":"And I go, yeah, that's great."},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"But, again, if I'm\nstuck in seeing things,"},"789":{"dur":3,"text":"and I'm not serving\nmyself, or I'm"},"793":{"dur":1,"text":"resistant to seeing\nsomething else,"},"794":{"dur":2,"text":"then you need to\nhelp me break down"},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"the barrier that's\nprotecting my sense of self"},"800":{"dur":4,"text":"and the world, so I can\nsee myself in a bigger way,"},"804":{"dur":4,"text":"and the world around me, that\ngives me more possibility."},"809":{"dur":4,"text":"So we do this by maybe saying\nsomething that's surprising."},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"I remember the first\ntime someone said to me,"},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"you know, I really\nintimidate people."},"818":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm like, me?"},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"I do that?"},"823":{"dur":2,"text":"That was surprising,\nmade me think."},"825":{"dur":3,"text":"Or a disruptive\nreflection, where you just"},"828":{"dur":3,"text":"hold up the mirror and allow\npeople to look at themselves."},"832":{"dur":3,"text":"Or a powerful question."},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"These are the things that\nmake me then stop and question"},"838":{"dur":1,"text":"myself."},"839":{"dur":1,"text":"And in that moment\nwhere I question"},"841":{"dur":3,"text":"myself is when there's\nthat great opportunity"},"845":{"dur":3,"text":"that I may learn something new."},"848":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's in this moment of\ndiscomfort that learning truly"},"852":{"dur":1,"text":"happens."},"854":{"dur":3,"text":"And, again, when my\nbrain breaks down,"},"857":{"dur":1,"text":"it's a really awesome process."},"859":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm sure you've seen it."},"860":{"dur":1,"text":"Where you say\nsomething to someone,"},"862":{"dur":1,"text":"and there really is a breakdown."},"864":{"dur":4,"text":"So what happens is, they will\nstare at you for a moment."},"868":{"dur":3,"text":"Because their brain is going,\nuh, something new here."},"872":{"dur":2,"text":"And it takes a moment to rewire."},"874":{"dur":3,"text":"And so it's almost\nlike a trance state."},"877":{"dur":1,"text":"But it's very similar,\nif you've ever"},"879":{"dur":3,"text":"seen a baby see something\nnew for the very first time."},"883":{"dur":2,"text":"What do they do?"},"885":{"dur":1,"text":"They just stare at it."},"887":{"dur":3,"text":"And then when the brain\nkind of formulates meaning,"},"891":{"dur":1,"text":"then they either\ncry or they laugh,"},"892":{"dur":3,"text":"depending on if they think\nit's a threat or if it's funny."},"896":{"dur":1,"text":"It's the same thing with adults."},"898":{"dur":2,"text":"We kind of, like, huh?"},"900":{"dur":1,"text":"And so this is a moment."},"901":{"dur":3,"text":"If you create this, you\nhave to let it happen."},"904":{"dur":1,"text":"Don't talk."},"906":{"dur":1,"text":"Just let the silence happen."},"907":{"dur":1,"text":"Let their brain rewire."},"909":{"dur":2,"text":"And then they'll probably\nhave an emotional reaction,"},"912":{"dur":1,"text":"where they may feel awkward."},"913":{"dur":1,"text":"They may laugh at themselves."},"915":{"dur":1,"text":"They may be embarrassed."},"916":{"dur":1,"text":"They may be sad."},"917":{"dur":2,"text":"They could be angry."},"920":{"dur":1,"text":"But it'll dissipate."},"921":{"dur":0,"text":"You just hold on."},"922":{"dur":1,"text":"You just let them\nwork through it."},"923":{"dur":2,"text":"And then you say, so, what\nhave you now discovered?"},"926":{"dur":2,"text":"What is true for you now?"},"929":{"dur":4,"text":"And let them tell you\nwhat they now see."},"933":{"dur":2,"text":"And once we change\nour view of who"},"936":{"dur":2,"text":"I think I am in the\nworld around me,"},"938":{"dur":3,"text":"then my behavior\nchanges as well."},"942":{"dur":1,"text":"And, again, it's\nfar more efficient"},"943":{"dur":3,"text":"than you trying to tell\nsomeone your great advice"},"946":{"dur":2,"text":"and brilliant ideas."},"949":{"dur":2,"text":"It just doesn't stick."},"951":{"dur":2,"text":"So the question,\nthen, is how do we"},"953":{"dur":4,"text":"know what to say that's\ngoing to create this moment?"},"958":{"dur":3,"text":"Where does that come from?"},"961":{"dur":2,"text":"So a friend of mine was doing\nher doctoral dissertation"},"964":{"dur":5,"text":"where she was interviewing\nall these master coaches that"},"969":{"dur":2,"text":"seem to be able to do\nthis almost naturally."},"972":{"dur":2,"text":"And she asked them,\nwhat exactly is it"},"974":{"dur":3,"text":"that you do that creates\nthat moment where people go,"},"978":{"dur":3,"text":"oh, wow, and they change?"},"981":{"dur":4,"text":"And all of them said, well,\nI access my intuition."},"985":{"dur":2,"text":"But the difficult thing,\nwhen she asked them, so,"},"988":{"dur":1,"text":"how do you do that?"},"990":{"dur":1,"text":"Was like, oh,\nwell, I don't know."},"991":{"dur":0,"text":"You know."},"992":{"dur":1,"text":"You just listen."},"994":{"dur":1,"text":"And they had a\nvery difficult time"},"995":{"dur":3,"text":"articulating what\nexactly they did."},"998":{"dur":5,"text":"But if you can't articulate\nit, you can't really teach it."},"1003":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I said, I've\ngot to codify this."},"1005":{"dur":1,"text":"I have to bring it\nto a place to where"},"1007":{"dur":3,"text":"people know what it\nis they're doing."},"1011":{"dur":3,"text":"Because otherwise if\nI don't do

it."},"1988":{"dur":2,"text":"That truly makes the difference."},"1991":{"dur":2,"text":"So when we listen\nfrom our brain,"},"1993":{"dur":4,"text":"we do here belief\nsystems and

what the box is."},"2017":{"dur":1,"text":"We hear that from the brain."},"2018":{"dur":3,"text":"But from the heart, we\nreally hear what they want,"},"2021":{"dur":1,"text":"and what they

truly moving forward"},"2052":{"dur":2,"text":"because of what has\nhappened before?"},"2054":{"dur":3,"text":"And then from the core,\nwe hear their fears."},"2058":{"dur":1,"text":"And then what

her."},"2245":{"dur":1,"text":"OK, so that's from your brain."},"2247":{"dur":2,"text":"But now what I'd like you\nto do is, again, to pause."},"2249":{"dur":2,"text":"Take a breath."},"2251":{"dur":5,"text":"And do that visualization where\nyou see elevator moving down."},"2257":{"dur":1,"text":"And it slowly floats down."},"2258":{"dur":3,"text":"And it comes to\nrest at your heart."},"2261":{"dur":4,"text":"And, again, you see someone or\nsomething when the door opens"},"2266":{"dur":2,"text":"that makes you smile,\nmakes you feel good."},"2268":{"dur":5,"text":"And just feel that\nheart space opening."},"2274":{"dur":3,"text":"And I want you to try to\nlisten to the next part"},"2277":{"dur":3,"text":"of the conversation\nthrough your

say?"},"2288":{"dur":1,"text":"And what might you ask her?"},"2289":{"dur":2,"text":"And see if it's different."},"2292":{"dur":3,"text":"So I asked Anna what\nshe felt her purpose

like\nyou to do is to, again,"},"2379":{"dur":1,"text":"go back to your heart."},"2381":{"dur":1,"text":"And I want you to notice."},"2382":{"dur":3,"text":"Say goodbye to that\nperson or that thing."},"2385":{"dur":3,"text":"And I want you to let\nthe elevator go down."},"2388":{"dur":4,"text":"And it comes to\nrest at your core."},"2393":{"dur":2,"text":"And I want you to\nfeel the courage that"},"2395":{"dur":1,"text":"emanates from here."},"2396":{"dur":2,"text":"Feel the strength of your core."},"2399":{"dur":1,"text":"Say the word\ncourage to yourself."},"2404":{"dur":1,"text":"Now see if you can't\nlisten through your core."},"2409":{"dur":3,"text":"She said to me, I do want\nto be seen as a leader."},"2413":{"dur":3,"text":"But if I change my way,\nwhy would they believe me?"},"2417":{"dur":2,"text":"Aren't I being inauthentic\nif all of a sudden I'm"},"2420":{"dur":2,"text":"the nice one?"},"2422":{"dur":0,"text":"She paused."},"2423":{"dur":1,"text":"And didn't say anything."},"2425":{"dur":3,"text":"And I just held the silence."},"2428":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, maybe I could\nstart by having"},"2430":{"dur":2,"text":"one-on-one meetings with\npeople to show that I really"},"2433":{"dur":3,"text":"am interested in their ideas."},"2436":{"dur":1,"text":"I am interested, you

difficult"},"2470":{"dur":1,"text":"for you to go to any\nof these centers."},"2472":{"dur":1,"text":"And we all listen from our head."},"2474":{"dur":3,"text":"But most of you will be able\nto access

client\nand I don't know what to say,"},"2502":{"dur":4,"text":"if I go to my heart,\nboom, it shows up."},"2507":{"dur":2,"text":"And so when I run people\nthrough these exercises,"},"2509":{"dur":1,"text":"and they get to\nlisten to each other,"},"2511":{"dur":2,"text":"it's amazing the\nquestions that show up"},"2513":{"dur":2,"text":"from the head, the\nheart, and the gut."},"2515":{"dur":3,"text":"And I can I ask you, if you\nnoticed it was difficult,"},"2518":{"dur":0,"text":"just try it."},"2519":{"dur":3,"text":"Listen to someone differently\ntonight, from your heart"},"2522":{"dur":1,"text":"or from your gut."},"2524":{"dur":2,"text":"And what comes forth\nin that conversation?"},"2529":{"dur":2,"text":"The point is is that we want\nto get people to stop and think"},"2531":{"dur":1,"text":"about their thinking,\nnot tell them what to do."},"2533":{"dur":1,"text":"But just to get them to stop."},"2535":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you listen with\nyour

process of\ncreating their analytical brain"},"2555":{"dur":1,"text":"goes quiet."},"2557":{"dur":3,"text":"And then they just-- what\ncomes forth is what they say."},"2560":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's the same process."},"2562":{"dur":2,"text":"If you can quiet your\nanalytical brain,"},"2564":{"dur":3,"text":"and allow yourself to give voice\nto your heart, and your

sad."},"2634":{"dur":2,"text":"They'll be angry."},"2636":{"dur":2,"text":"But then they'll grow."},"2638":{"dur":5,"text":"And we do this by\ncourageously coaching people,"},"2643":{"dur":4,"text":"but using conscious listening."},"2647":{"dur":1,"text":"And just feeding\nback what we hear"},"2649":{"dur":3,"text":"and what we sense\nso they can see"},"2652":{"dur":3,"text":"these things for themselves."},"2655":{"dur":1,"text":"So, again, I really\nwant to start"},"2657":{"dur":2,"text":"changing the\nconversations we have"},"2660":{"dur":2,"text":"so we are actually\nhelping people"},"2662":{"dur":4,"text":"not just do their jobs well,\nbut to step into their highest"},"2666":{"dur":4,"text":"selves of who they are\nthrough conscious listening."},"2671":{"dur":2,"text":"So I hope that you join me."},"2674":{"dur":3,"text":"And we start really\nlistening to each other"},"2677":{"dur":2,"text":"in a more

here"},"2713":{"dur":2,"text":"that it is difficult to reach?"},"2716":{"dur":3,"text":"But, again, always allow people\nto tell their stories first."},"2719":{"dur":2,"text":"So oftentimes we say, oh, I\ndon't want people to vent."},"2721":{"dur":2,"text":"And I want them to complain."},"2723":{"dur":1,"text":"But there's a seed\nin the complaint."},"2725":{"dur":2,"text":"There's something you're going\nto hear in the complaint."},"2728":{"dur":3,"text":"It's like, ah, that's the\nthing that's holding them back."},"2731":{"dur":2,"text":"And so you want to\nlisten for that."},"2734":{"dur":1,"text":"And then when you hold\nthat up, it's like,"},"2735":{"dur":1,"text":"well, I hear you say this."},"2737":{"dur":1,"text":"And yet you said this."},"2738":{"dur":3,"text":"And it kind of, like, collides."},"2741":{"dur":2,"text":"Or I can tell this is\nreally important to you."},"2744":{"dur":2,"text":"And yet you're being asked\nto do something else."},"2746":{"dur":1,"text":"Is that the problem?"},"2747":{"dur":1,"text":"So you listen to their story."},"2749":{"dur":3,"text":"And then you're going to find\nin there what's the problem?"},"2753":{"dur":0,"text":"You feed that back."},"2754":{"dur":1,"text":"And then ask the question."},"2755":{"dur":1,"text":"And that makes the difference."},"2756":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can do that\nwith an entire group."},"2759":{"dur":3,"text":"It's just that once they get\ninto the complaining thing,"},"2762":{"dur":1,"text":"it can really take off."},"2764":{"dur":1,"text":"But that's OK."},"2765":{"dur":2,"text":"Because we have to have\nit out on the table."},"2767":{"dur":2,"text":"My first job was in\na mental hospital."},"2770":{"dur":1,"text":"And they did this
