We'll actually hear"},"46":{"dur":1,"text":"something really exciting."},"47":{"dur":3,"text":"So, you can join the whole Apple\ncommunity of developers and build some"},"51":{"dur":1,"text":"really awesome apps."},"52":{"dur":5,"text":">> Also, iOS 7 is beautiful, hopefully,\nto some of you."},"58":{"dur":2,"text":"But it's controversial, I know."},"61":{"dur":4,"text":"And mainly, what I want to do is guide\nyou through Objective-C, and also"},"65":{"dur":5,"text":"Xcode, which is the integrated\ndevelopment environment that you'll be"},"70":{"dur":2,"text":"working in for iOS."},"73":{"dur":5,"text":">> And so, just a word on Objective-C.\nBasically, it's the exact same as C,"},"79":{"dur":3,"text":"but with a lot of other things."},"82":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, more strictly, it's actually a\nsuper-set of C. So anything that you"},"87":{"dur":4,"text":"can do in C right now, which is\nbasically like pset 0 through 6, you"},"92":{"dur":1,"text":"can do in Objective-C."},"94":{"dur":4,"text":">> So, don't

except now you're going\nto have a lot more to work with."},"105":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'm just going to lead you through a\ncouple of examples to highlight some"},"109":{"dur":4,"text":"of the key differences that I found were\nreally important when I learned"},"113":{"dur":3,"text":"Objective-C last year."},"117":{"dur":3,"text":">> Well actually, so, the other point\nis, Objective-C is, obviously,"},"120":{"dur":1,"text":"object-oriented."},"122":{"dur":4,"text":"And we'll discuss a little bit\nabout what that means later."},"126":{"dur":5,"text":"Basically, it's like how you worked with\nstructs in this past pset, with"},"131":{"dur":2,"text":"nodes and similar other\nthings like that."},"133":{"dur":3,"text":"Except, in Objective-C, everything is\nan object, and you're going to be"},"137":{"dur":3,"text":"passing around pointers to objects\nrather than the values themselves."},"140":{"dur":4,"text":"So, it's just something important\nto keep in mind."},"145":{"dur":4,"text":">> So, why don't we start with a few\ndifferences in syntax between C and"},"149":{"dur":1,"text":"Objective-C?"},"150":{"dur":7,"text":"I want to highlight the #include, you\nknow, standard io.h in C and C++, with"},"158":{"dur":5,"text":"the Objective-C version of that, which\nis #import, and then some sort of"},"164":{"dur":3,"text":"In this case, it would be UIKit,\nyou know, slash UIKit.h."},"168":{"dur":5,"text":"It could also be, you know, MKMapview\nto you slash MKMapview.h if you want"},"173":{"dur":2,"text":"to do, like, a map inside of your app."},"176":{"dur":0,"text":"Similar things like that."},"177":{"dur":4,"text":">> So, the important thing is include\nhas now changed to import."},"181":{"dur":3,"text":"But the idea still remains."},"184":{"dur":6,"text":"You're going to be importing some sort\nof header file into your program."},"190":{"dur":4,"text":">> I also want to highlight the difference\nbetween printf and NSLog."},"194":{"dur":5,"text":"However, as we said earlier, Objective-C\nis a strict super-set of"},"199":{"dur":3,"text":"C, which means that printf exists\nin Objective-C, too."},"202":{"dur":1,"text":"But, most people don't use that."},"204":{"dur":3,"text":"Most people use this NSLog because it\ngives you a time stamp, and we'll see"},"208":{"dur":1,"text":"it in action later."},"209":{"dur":3,"text":"But, it's generally a more useful\nway to print out variables."},"213":{"dur":4,"text":">> And I also want to highlight that\nNSLog takes in just the same"},"218":{"dur":3,"text":"placeholder values as printf does--"},"221":{"dur":4,"text":"so %d is for an int,\n%f is for a float."},"225":{"dur":3,"text":"However, I do want to highlight\nthis very last one--"},"229":{"dur":3,"text":"NSLog % at sign--"},"232":{"dur":2,"text":"that is a placeholder for an object."},"235":{"dur":5,"text":"And as I said earlier, Objective-C deals\npretty much mostly in objects,"},"241":{"dur":3,"text":"and so this will come in use when you\nwant to print out, perhaps, maybe an"},"245":{"dur":3,"text":"NSArray, or NSDictionary,\nor an NSString."},"248":{"dur":5,"text":">> So, also, notice that, in our NSLog\nstatement, we have an at sign in front"},"253":{"dur":1,"text":"of the quotation--"},"255":{"dur":5,"text":"that is to signify that strings, now,\nin Objective-C are objects."},"260":{"dur":2,"text":"They are no longer simply char stars."},"263":{"dur":2,"text":"They're objects and are\ntreated as such."},"265":{"dur":3,"text":">> So, it's really important that when\nyou use NSLog it takes in an NS"},"268":{"dur":3,"text":"string, which means that you'll have\nto include an at in front of your"},"272":{"dur":1,"text":"quotation marks."},"274":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's why you see, here, in all of\nmy function calls to this NSLog, I"},"278":{"dur":4,"text":"have an at in front of the quotes, even\nthough the %d and the %f's are"},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"all the same from C."},"285":{"dur":2,"text":">> Any questions so far?"},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll try to go through this quickly so\nthat we can have more time to work"},"290":{"dur":4,"text":"with Xcode and Objective-C, so\nthat you guys can get more"},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"familiar with it."},"297":{"dur":4,"text":">> Next, I want to highlight something\nconceptually important."},"301":{"dur":3,"text":"So, in C, most things are functions."},"305":{"dur":1,"text":"We make a function call."},"306":{"dur":3,"text":"We declare functions this way, with\nthe return type first, then the"},"310":{"dur":3,"text":"function name, parentheses, and then\nwhatever arguments and the type of"},"313":{"dur":2,"text":"these arguments we want to pass in."},"315":{"dur":4,"text":"And Objective-C, because everything\nis an object or class--"},"319":{"dur":4,"text":"so class and object are two terms that\nare mostly synonymous with each other,"},"323":{"dur":4,"text":"so I may use them interchangeably\nthroughout the seminar."},"328":{"dur":5,"text":">> But, you'll see that we have methods in\nObjective-C rather than functions."},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"And methods belong to objects."},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"So just as, maybe take\nfor example, node--"},"338":{"dur":1,"text":"our type [INAUDIBLE]"},"340":{"dur":4,"text":"node from pset 6 or 5--"},"344":{"dur":5,"text":"we have the word, property,\nor the next node pointer."},"349":{"dur":4,"text":"Methods are simply functions inside\nof some sort of structure."},"353":{"dur":3,"text":">> So, in this case, the structure would be\nthe object, and then the method is"},"357":{"dur":1,"text":"something that belongs to an object."},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is how you would declare,\nsort of, a method."},"362":{"dur":5,"text":"You would start with, again, the return\ntype-- so, I tried to color"},"367":{"dur":5,"text":"code the key words here so that you guys\ncan see the, at least, formatting"},"372":{"dur":4,"text":"similarities between function\ndeclarations and method declarations."},"377":{"dur":4,"text":"So, you start with, you know, a return\ntype-- in this case, it's an array, or"},"381":{"dur":1,"text":"an NSArray pointer--"},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"and then you have this method."},"386":{"dur":4,"text":"And then, what's interesting here is\nthat instead of having parentheses, we"},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"have these colons."},"392":{"dur":5,"text":"And then, in front of our arguments, we\nput, again, in parentheses the type"},"398":{"dur":0,"text":"of our argument."},"399":{"dur":3,"text":">> So, right now I'm trying to make the\ncomparison between, you know, n and"},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"number, because they're\nboth like ints."},"405":{"dur":4,"text":"And then, the other one\nis an NSUInteger type."},"409":{"dur":6,"text":"And then, with Objective-C, when you\nwant to have multiple arguments in"},"416":{"dur":3,"text":"your method clause, you, sort of,\nseparate them out kind of like this--"},"420":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm not quite sure how to describe it,\nbut this is a good example of how you"},"423":{"dur":2,"text":"can have multiple arguments in there."},"426":{"dur":3,"text":">> You could, of course, just totally\nignore the andArray colon NSArray"},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"array if you wanted just a method\nthat takes in one argument."},"433":{"dur":5,"text":">> AUDIENCE: Are both NSUInteger and\nNSArray arguments that can be taken in"},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"within the NSArray?"},"441":{"dur":0,"text":">> RHED SHI: Yes."},"442":{"dur":1,"text":"So, let me explain."},"443":{"dur":6,"text":"So, the question was are NSUInteger and\nNSArray* types of the arguments,"},"450":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's correct."},"451":{"dur":4,"text":"So, you always want to specify what\nthe type of your argument is."},"455":{"dur":5,"text":"And here, I'm trying to introduce you\nto some of the syntax and vocab of"},"461":{"dur":4,"text":"Objective-C, so those are actual types\nthat you'll be dealing with."},"465":{"dur":3,"text":">> And as you'll notice, arrays\nare no longer, sort of,"},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"simple bracket things."},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"They're objects."},"472":{"dur":4,"text":"Although, if we go on to the next\nslide, we can see that we can"},"476":{"dur":5,"text":"hard-code an NSArray in Objective-C with\nsimply an at symbol in front of"},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"the brackets."},"484":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm not, actually, quite sure whether\nI syntactically hard-coded an array"},"488":{"dur":7,"text":"correctly for the C version, but that's\nsupposed to be in a C array."},"496":{"dur":3,"text":">> So, this is how you would, you know,\nperhaps use the functions or the"},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"methods that we created earlier."},"501":{"dur":0,"text":"Right?"},"502":{"dur":3,"text":"So, this is where we declare our\nfunction and our method."},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"And now we want to use them in\nour program, and this is"},"508":{"dur":1,"text":"how we would do it."},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"So, in C, you would have, you know,\nperhaps, a bool b, and you set it to"},"512":{"dur":4,"text":"equal the function, and then\nyou pass in the arguments."},"516":{"dur":2,"text":">> In Objective-C, it's pretty\nmuch the same thing."},"519":{"dur":4,"text":"You have NSArray* my_array, and it's\ngoing to equal-- now, the only"},"523":{"dur":4,"text":"difference here is this object thing,\nwhich I've highlighted in yellow, and"},"527":{"dur":3,"text":"as you can see, in C, there's\nno other yellow word."},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's because methods belong\nwith a certain object."},"534":{"dur":5,"text":"So that's why I need to have an object\nthat, sort of, calls this method on"},"539":{"dur":4,"text":"the number zero, and then\nthe NSArray a, b, c, d."},"544":{"dur":0,"text":"Any questions on that?"},"545":{"dur":6,"text":">> We'll see these concepts in action\npretty soon when we go into a demo."},"552":{"dur":1,"text":"OK."},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, I want to talk a little bit briefly\nabout Xcode 5, which is the"},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"integrated development environment\nthat you'll be working with."},"561":{"dur":5,"text":"I know a lot of you, or some of you,\ndon't have Macs, which is a problem"},"566":{"dur":4,"text":"because Xcode is not available\nfor Windows and PC."},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"Don't ask me why, but probably--"},"572":{"dur":0,"text":"yeah, corporate."},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"Whatever."},"575":{"dur":4,"text":"But anyway, so, I apologize if some of\nyou do have to download some sort of"},"579":{"dur":3,"text":"virtual machine for Mac in\norder to run Xcode 5."},"583":{"dur":3,"text":"But it is a pretty nifty\nsoftware to use."},"586":{"dur":4,"text":">> And so, before we dive into any sort\nof demo, I just want to show you a"},"591":{"dur":4,"text":"picture of what Xcode looks like in your\nwindow, and then also talk about"},"595":{"dur":1,"text":"what this whole space is."},"597":{"dur":3,"text":"So, it's kind of like learning how to\nuse Microsoft Word, except you want to"},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"get familiarized with all the\ndifferent things that"},"604":{"dur":1,"text":"are going on here."},"606":{"dur":4,"text":">> So first, I want to point you\nto the toolbar at the top."},"611":{"dur":3,"text":"You'll see that, at the top,\nyou'll have the file name--"},"614":{"dur":3,"text":"or, actually, your project name\nand then your file name."},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"Take note of the play and\nthe stop buttons."},"620":{"dur":3,"text":"Those are the ones that you'll be\nusing to run your app on the"},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"simulator--"},"625":{"dur":0,"text":"the iOS simulator."},"626":{"dur":3,"text":"This automatically comes with Xcode 5,\nso you don't have to worry about"},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"downloading some sort of simulator."},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"You just press play and\nthen it runs your app."},"634":{"dur":4,"text":"And you can play around with you, and\nyou'll see how it works later."},"639":{"dur":3,"text":">> And then, in the center, of course, is\nwhere all of your beautiful code is"},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"going to go."},"644":{"dur":4,"text":"And then, on the left-hand side, you'll\nhave this, sort of, folder--"},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"navigation--"},"650":{"dur":3,"text":"and then, you'll also see that, along\nwith the folder icon, there are a"},"653":{"dur":3,"text":"bunch of other icons there that\nwill be useful later."},"657":{"dur":7,"text":">> And then, on the right side is a utility\narea where you can work with"},"664":{"dur":4,"text":"some of the objects and specify, you\nknow, what the color should be, what"},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"the text font should be, et cetera."},"672":{"dur":3,"text":"Although, everything that you do\nin the utility area, you can"},"675":{"dur":1,"text":"do in code as well."},"677":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, I'll be going through two\nexamples of using, simply, no code at"},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"all-- or very minimal code--"},"683":{"dur":4,"text":"verses all code, just so that you guys\nknow what you can and cannot do in"},"688":{"dur":0,"text":"Xcode and Objective-C."},"689":{"dur":3,"text":">> And then, finally, down at the bottom,\nyou have the debug area."},"692":{"dur":4,"text":"So, you no longer have to run GDB,\net cetera, on your programs."},"697":{"dur":1,"text":"It automatically does it for you."},"699":{"dur":3,"text":"And you can also print\nstuff to this area."},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"So actually, later, we'll go through\nmario.c, if you guys still remember"},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"that, in Xcode."},"709":{"dur":1,"text":"So that should be fun."},"710":{"dur":5,"text":">> And then, just to bring it back to\nObjective-C, I want to highlight what"},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"you can do with if statements."},"717":{"dur":5,"text":"So, you know, because Objective-C is a\nsuperset of C, everything you do is,"},"723":{"dur":3,"text":"literally, the same as C. You just\nhave slight differences."},"726":{"dur":3,"text":"So, you'll notice the form for an if\nstatement is still the same-- you have"},"730":{"dur":3,"text":"if, and then you have parentheses with\na condition inside of, it and then"},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"curly braces for whatever you\nwant to do inside of there."},"737":{"dur":4,"text":">> However, I wanted to put this slide up\nhere, simply to illustrate that,"},"741":{"dur":4,"text":"because we're dealing with objects now,\nwe will have to use these things"},"745":{"dur":5,"text":"called like, is equal to string, which\nis, coincidentally, a method of a"},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"string or an NSString object."},"753":{"dur":4,"text":"So, word, in this case, is an NSString\nobject, and it has a method called is"},"758":{"dur":5,"text":"equal to string, and then we're passing\nin a hard-coded string to see"},"764":{"dur":3,"text":"whether those are equal\nto one another."},"768":{"dur":3,"text":">> Any questions so far?"},"771":{"dur":0,"text":"OK."},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"And, I want to go over\na for statement also."},"776":{"dur":5,"text":">> So, for example, if we wanted to loop\nover the length of a string in C, this"},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"should be familiar to you."},"783":{"dur":4,"text":"And, in Objective-C, I do want\nto highlight this, sort of,"},"787":{"dur":1,"text":"method called count."},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, actually, let me\njust take that back."},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"Count is a method of array."},"797":{"dur":3,"text":"However, it's more specifically a\nproperty of array, which is why you"},"801":{"dur":1,"text":"can use the dot notation."},"802":{"dur":3,"text":"But I don't want to get into too much of\nthis conceptual stuff, I just want"},"805":{"dur":4,"text":"to show you how things would look\nlike in Objective-C versus C."},"810":{"dur":5,"text":">> And also, I do want to point out that\neven though I've been using NSUInteger"},"815":{"dur":4,"text":"in front of all my i's in Objective-C,\nyou can also use int, because int is"},"819":{"dur":2,"text":"totally valid in Objective-C, also."},"822":{"dur":1,"text":">> AUDIENCE: Is it just\nstylistic, or is--"},"824":{"dur":1,"text":"So, as you'll see--"},"826":{"dur":3,"text":"so, the question was is that\njust a stylistic issue."},"829":{"dur":5,"text":"As you'll see, I have a, sort of, star\nasterisk thing down at the bottom, and"},"834":{"dur":5,"text":"that link takes you to a Stack Overflow\nform, where someone explains"},"839":{"dur":3,"text":"the difference between an int in\nNSInteger and an NSUInteger."},"843":{"dur":1,"text":"And so, you can read about that later."},"845":{"dur":2,"text":"These slides will be, of course,\navailable to you."},"850":{"dur":0,"text":">> Let's see."},"851":{"dur":0,"text":"OK, awesome."},"852":{"dur":3,"text":"So, this is also included in the slide\nbecause I thought this was a great"},"855":{"dur":3,"text":"website that introduces you\nto Objective-C syntax."},"859":{"dur":5,"text":"So, actually , why don't we move to\nChrome and check out this website?"},"870":{"dur":0,"text":">> Right."},"871":{"dur":5,"text":"So, what I want to show you\nguys here is this image."},"876":{"dur":4,"text":"So, this is, sort of, going to be what\nyou're going to see inside of any"},"881":{"dur":1,"text":"Xcode file."},"887":{"dur":4,"text":"Actually, why don't we just take a\nmoment to, sort of, take this in."},"891":{"dur":2,"text":">> So, this book--"},"893":{"dur":2,"text":"that's the object that\nwe're dealing with."},"895":{"dur":3,"text":"And then, it's obviously going to be\ninherited from some other object, but"},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"you don't have to worry about that."},"901":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, it, perhaps, has\nsome member variables."},"904":{"dur":4,"text":">> The important thing I want to show you\nis the instance methods, here."},"909":{"dur":3,"text":"So, instance methods are denoted\nby this minus sign."},"912":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, as you'll notice, we're\nalready starting to see the paradigm"},"915":{"dur":2,"text":"for method declaration, right?"},"917":{"dur":5,"text":"The return type, the method name, , and\nthen the type of the argument, and"},"922":{"dur":1,"text":"then the name of the argument."},"924":{"dur":4,"text":"And this minus sign means that it's an\ninstance method, which means that"},"929":{"dur":3,"text":"these methods are only available to\nobjects that have been instantiated."},"935":{"dur":4,"text":">> To contrast that, methods with a plus\nsign in front of them are class"},"939":{"dur":4,"text":"methods, which means that you can call\nthese methods, even if you don't have"},"943":{"dur":2,"text":"an object created yet."},"945":{"dur":5,"text":"So, for a clear example,\nNSString is a class."},"951":{"dur":4,"text":"And you can call, for example,\nclass methods on NSString--"},"955":{"dur":2,"text":"the actual, like, word NSString."},"958":{"dur":3,"text":">> However, in order to use these\nmethods, you actually"},"962":{"dur":1,"text":"need to create a string."},"963":{"dur":5,"text":"For example, NSString star string equals\nat quotation mark, hello world."},"968":{"dur":1,"text":"And then, you can use these methods--"},"970":{"dur":1,"text":"instance methods--"},"971":{"dur":2,"text":"on that hello world string."},"974":{"dur":3,"text":"So, that's the difference between\ninstance methods and class methods."},"980":{"dur":1,"text":">> And, we just covered this part."},"985":{"dur":8,"text":"Properties are another thing that are\ninside of objects, basically."},"993":{"dur":3,"text":"And you declare them with\nthe at property keyword."},"997":{"dur":2,"text":"You have these options, here,\nthat I'll explain later when"},"999":{"dur":3,"text":"we go into a demo."},"1003":{"dur":1,"text":">> AUDIENCE: Could you zoom in, please?"},"1005":{"dur":0,"text":">> RHED SHI: Oh yes."},"1006":{"dur":2,"text":">> AUDIENCE: Thank you."},"1009":{"dur":0,"text":">> RHED SHI: That should be a lot better."},"1010":{"dur":1,"text":">> AUDIENCE: Yeah."},"1011":{"dur":2,"text":"Thank you."},"1013":{"dur":2,"text":">> RHED SHI: Yeah, please remind me if\nI forget to zoom in or zoom out."},"1020":{"dur":2,"text":"So, this is all I wanted\nto show you for--"},"1023":{"dur":2,"text":"whoa, that's a lot--"},"1025":{"dur":0,"text":"for this website."},"1026":{"dur":5,"text":"So, let's go back to our slides."},"1032":{"dur":5,"text":">> Actually, now let's take a moment\nto dive into a demo."},"1037":{"dur":7,"text":"So, we'll start with a\nnew Xcode project."},"1045":{"dur":7,"text":"So, if you'll open up Xcode on all of\nyour machines, it should take you some"},"1053":{"dur":3,"text":"page where it says, like, either open\nup an existing project or a new"},"1056":{"dur":2,"text":"project, and you should\nclick a new project."},"1059":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, it should take\nyou to this screen."},"1061":{"dur":2,"text":">> AUDIENCE: If we don't have a Mac,\ndo we just kind of chill?"},"1064":{"dur":2,"text":">>

to do first, now,\nis, actually, we're going to do a"},"1075":{"dur":1,"text":"single view application."},"1076":{"dur":4,"text":"So, if you'll notice, what's great\nabout Xcode and Apple support for"},"1081":{"dur":4,"text":"developers is that you have a lot of\ntemplates to work with already."},"1085":{"dur":3,"text":"You could, for example, make a\nmaster-detail application."},"1089":{"dur":1,"text":"You can make a game--"},"1090":{"dur":2,"text":"and actually, I won't go into games,\nbecause games are a different story"},"1093":{"dur":1,"text":"for iOS
