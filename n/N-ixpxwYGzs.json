me know and I'll speed it up."},"28":{"dur":5,"text":"So I'm an artist living in East Oakland,\nout by the Coliseum."},"33":{"dur":6,"text":"I lived in San Francisco -- '97 till 2009\nand then moved to the East Bay,"},"39":{"dur":2,"text":"to get more space."},"42":{"dur":4,"text":"Can't really have space living in the city."},"47":{"dur":3,"text":"I graduated from the Academy in 2005."},"50":{"dur":6,"text":"Took me ten years to get through a four-year program."},"56":{"dur":4,"text":"I started as a Motion Picture major, then Illustration --"},"61":{"dur":6,"text":"or no -- Animation, then Illustration, then Fine Art."},"68":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's see, I -- I didn't grow up making art."},"72":{"dur":3,"text":"I did early on, and then I started skateboarding\nwhen I was about ten"},"76":{"dur":6,"text":"and that took control over my life."},"82":{"dur":6,"text":"From ten to about twenty-one,\nit was skateboarding and playing music."},"89":{"dur":8,"text":"I moved out here to study film\nbecause I always had a video camera\nand I would shoot my friends --"},"98":{"dur":3,"text":"film my friends skateboarding\nand snowboarding, whatever."},"102":{"dur":3,"text":"I sort of fell into art when I got here."},"105":{"dur":4,"text":"The people I was skateboarding with\nand playing music with were artists themselves"},"110":{"dur":5,"text":"and inspired me to start trying it."},"116":{"dur":1,"text":"I wasn't that good in the beginning."},"118":{"dur":2,"text":"I failed my first Analysis of Form class."},"120":{"dur":4,"text":"Took it again -- I almost failed it twice."},"125":{"dur":2,"text":"When I switched over to Animation, I had to --"},"127":{"dur":2,"text":"Animation students have to take\nfigure drawing classes,"},"130":{"dur":2,"text":"and I remember my teacher\npulled me aside one day"},"133":{"dur":3,"text":"and told me I was the worst student in the class\nand I had to go to workshops,"},"136":{"dur":5,"text":"and that was what changed everything."},"141":{"dur":6,"text":"So I started going to one workshop a week,\nthen two, then three --"},"148":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't know if this is the same now,\nbut the workshops when I was in --"},"151":{"dur":6,"text":"from '97 to about 2004,\nthe workshops were happening."},"157":{"dur":4,"text":"That was where all\nthe most serious students were at."},"162":{"dur":7,"text":"And there was a certain bar\nthat was placed in the workshops."},"169":{"dur":4,"text":"So I started going to them once a week,\ntwice a week, three times a week, then every day."},"174":{"dur":2,"text":"And once I started going every day,\nI started enjoying it."},"176":{"dur":4,"text":"And once I started enjoying it,\nI started getting better at drawing."},"180":{"dur":3,"text":"I did that for about three years --\njust every day in the workshops."},"184":{"dur":4,"text":"And then when I turned twenty-four,\nI started painting."},"188":{"dur":2,"text":"Painting was --"},"191":{"dur":3,"text":"drawing was a real struggle for me, it still is --"},"194":{"dur":4,"text":"but painting came a little bit more naturally."},"199":{"dur":5,"text":"I think it's because you work with form\nrather than line."},"204":{"dur":3,"text":"So I gravitated towards painting\nmore so than drawing."},"208":{"dur":3,"text":"And switched over to Fine Art."},"211":{"dur":5,"text":"So if people know who I am, know my work --"},"217":{"dur":2,"text":"they know me for the Waiting Series."},"220":{"dur":3,"text":"The Waiting Series I started in 2001, when I was --"},"223":{"dur":5,"text":"I quit going to school for a year\nbecause I was working in Emeryville --"},"229":{"dur":5,"text":"at a software company\ndoing help desk IT -- basic IT stuff."},"234":{"dur":5,"text":"And when I was commuting back and forth,\nby BART and train or bus,"},"240":{"dur":4,"text":"I noticed there's a disconnect amongst the commuters,"},"244":{"dur":2,"text":"so I started a series based on that disconnect."},"247":{"dur":2,"text":"And it wasn't really anything more than that."},"250":{"dur":5,"text":"It was just paintings about waiting to be\nsomewhere else -- people in transit."},"256":{"dur":8,"text":"So that was in 2001, and I started that series\nwhile I was taking a hiatus from the Academy."},"265":{"dur":4,"text":"I got laid off, took me six months to get an interview,"},"270":{"dur":5,"text":"I had a second interview, then I missed it\nbecause someone jumped on the BART tracks,"},"275":{"dur":3,"text":"held the train -- it was right around 9\/11,\nso I missed my second interview"},"279":{"dur":2,"text":"and that day I decided to re-enroll\nback at the Academy."},"282":{"dur":4,"text":"And that was in 2003 I believe."},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"And when I re-enrolled, it was --"},"289":{"dur":2,"text":"I re-enrolled as a Fine Art major -- painting."},"291":{"dur":5,"text":"This is just the start of the Waiting Series."},"297":{"dur":1,"text":"I ended it last year."},"298":{"dur":7,"text":"I did about three hundred or so, give or take,\npaintings within that series."},"305":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'll talk about a few other series that are ongoing."},"309":{"dur":3,"text":"When I was in school, I wasn't afraid\nto experiment and explore"},"313":{"dur":7,"text":"and I encourage you all to do that while you're here."},"321":{"dur":4,"text":"So I messed around with different mediums --\nresin, panel paintings,"},"325":{"dur":5,"text":"similar to David Hockney's photo montages."},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"I've been working on another series\nfrom passport photos --"},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"found or discarded passports."},"337":{"dur":2,"text":"That series is ongoing."},"339":{"dur":7,"text":"But the purpose of talking about these series\nis each one evolves into the next."},"346":{"dur":1,"text":"And they all sort of merge together."},"348":{"dur":6,"text":"They're separate series,\nbut I kind of look at it as being one thing."},"354":{"dur":2,"text":"So yeah, I'm just going to go through --"},"357":{"dur":6,"text":"I have a few slides from the early\nWaiting paintings, and yeah."},"363":{"dur":5,"text":"So this -- I still have this painting,\nbut it's a bad image of it because\nit's covered in plastic."},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"But this is like Waiting No. 3."},"371":{"dur":4,"text":"This is -- I think it's Powell Street BART."},"375":{"dur":3,"text":"The early Waiting paintings were --"},"379":{"dur":3,"text":"I didn't stray too far away from the photograph."},"382":{"dur":3,"text":"It was sort of an Impressionistic approach to realism,"},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"if you want to call it that."},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was very influenced by what I was learning here."},"391":{"dur":5,"text":"This is a couple years forward --\nthis is probably like Waiting No. 7 or something --"},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that's Civic Center BART."},"399":{"dur":3,"text":"And then I was trying to --\njust playing with a monochromatic palette."},"402":{"dur":5,"text":"So around 2004, I started -- I was working at Kinko's,"},"407":{"dur":3,"text":"and Kinko's was where\nI did a lot of my experimentation"},"411":{"dur":3,"text":"and tried out new mediums and different ideas"},"415":{"dur":6,"text":"and just had a lot of fun\nexperimenting with their machines."},"421":{"dur":6,"text":"While I was there, I started a series\nfrom found or discarded passports."},"427":{"dur":8,"text":"And in the beginning, they were small\nand kind of cute -- like little characters."},"436":{"dur":5,"text":"These are about 4 inches by 3 inches."},"441":{"dur":3,"text":"I was doing small work\nbecause before this series,"},"445":{"dur":3,"text":"I was working on another series\nthat I called the Panel Series"},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"and it was similar to David Hockney's\nphoto montages,"},"452":{"dur":4,"text":"where I would take a bunch of photographs\nand then stitch them together"},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"and then paint each photograph separately"},"459":{"dur":1,"text":"and then put it back together as one painting --"},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"and paint it -- as one painting."},"463":{"dur":3,"text":"Those paintings would take me\nmonths and months to finish,"},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"and I was in school and working."},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"So I started this series, which was --"},"471":{"dur":5,"text":"the paintings are very quick,\nand there's not  a lot of thought,\nand they're fun, so --"},"477":{"dur":6,"text":"it was a way for me to step outside of myself\nand get back to the enjoyment of the process."},"483":{"dur":4,"text":"A few years later, they evolved and they got bigger --"},"488":{"dur":3,"text":"and I started making up names\nfor the people that I was painting."},"492":{"dur":3,"text":"I was looking at these passport pictures\nnot knowing who they were,"},"495":{"dur":3,"text":"but when you spend hours and hours\nlooking at somebody you don't know,"},"499":{"dur":4,"text":"your mind starts to create these personalities\nand these personas about these people,"},"504":{"dur":1,"text":"so I started naming them."},"506":{"dur":4,"text":"These are about 5 1\/2 x 6 inches."},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"They got a little bit bigger."},"512":{"dur":6,"text":"From 2001 to 2007,\nI was doing the Waiting series,"},"518":{"dur":3,"text":"I was playing around with resin,"},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"the same way you put together\na Photoshop image, with resin --"},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, with layers."},"527":{"dur":6,"text":"I was doing these resin pieces\nin a similar sort of format, process --"},"533":{"dur":3,"text":"I would print out transparencies\nof Photoshop images --"},"537":{"dur":6,"text":"image with a bunch of layers\nand then build these resin cubes."},"543":{"dur":4,"text":"And then after doing that for a few years,\nthe resin's really bad for you,"},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"so I stopped working on the resin."},"550":{"dur":4,"text":"And I was also working on the Panel Series,\nI was working on the Passport Series,"},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"I was playing and experimenting a lot at Kinko's"},"557":{"dur":4,"text":"and with the tools that they had,\ntheir different machines."},"562":{"dur":6,"text":"So I graduated in 2005,\nand in 2007, I had a serious look at my work."},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"So my website had resinwork,"},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"it had panel paintings,"},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"it had passport paintings,"},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"It had Waiting paintings,"},"576":{"dur":3,"text":"it had still lifes, it had cityscapes --"},"579":{"dur":3,"text":"It had all this stuff."},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"I was very lucky, in a sense,"},"585":{"dur":4,"text":"that it took me ten years\nto get through school."},"590":{"dur":1,"text":"I wasn't lucky because it took so long,"},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"but I was lucky in that I met a lot of people --"},"595":{"dur":1,"text":"a couple different generations\nthat had come out"},"596":{"dur":4,"text":"and gone into the art world\nand make art for a living."},"601":{"dur":4,"text":"So I had a lot of good examples to lead by."},"605":{"dur":4,"text":"So I was looking at my friends\nthat are already somewhat established artists"},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"and seeing what worked for them."},"613":{"dur":6,"text":"And I realized in 2007 that the guys\nthat were showing in galleries\nand selling work"},"619":{"dur":3,"text":"were the ones that had\na cohesive body of work"},"623":{"dur":4,"text":"and they had a thing that\nidentified themselves to what they do."},"627":{"dur":4,"text":"So I stripped everything off my website\nexcept for Waiting."},"632":{"dur":6,"text":"The Waiting Series was the only series\nthat really held my interest throughout the years."},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"I would work on some Waiting paintings,\nand then I would stop."},"642":{"dur":3,"text":"I would do something else,\nand then I'd come back to it, and do it again."},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"That happened from 2001 to 2007."},"648":{"dur":3,"text":"So in 2007, I decided to brand myself --"},"652":{"dur":4,"text":"that's kind of a bad word to use amongst artists,"},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"but it's reality of the business that wer'e in,"},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"because if you don't treat it like a business,\nthen you're going to struggle."},"662":{"dur":1,"text":"You're going to struggle anyway."},"663":{"dur":5,"text":"But the more you treat it like a business,\nthe better off you're going to be."},"668":{"dur":1,"text":"So I branded myself with Waiting."},"669":{"dur":5,"text":"I wanted people to see someone at the bus stop,"},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"sitting there waiting, and think of me and my work."},"677":{"dur":3,"text":"So I stripped everything off my website,\nand that's the only thing I had on there,"},"681":{"dur":4,"text":"but when I came back to the series,\nthe concept had changed over the years."},"685":{"dur":3,"text":"So it was no longer about waiting to get\nfrom point A to point B,"},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"but what happens while we wait."},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"When you anticipate the future,\nwe think about the past,"},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"but we're not really in the present moment."},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"We're not in the now.\nWe're not in the here."},"697":{"dur":3,"text":"So the work became about\nwhat's happening while we wait."},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"What's our mind doing?"},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"Are we conscious? Are we unconscious?"},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"So I thought the best way to do that,"},"709":{"dur":8,"text":"to illustrate that idea was\nto strip out the environment\nand just have one subject --"},"717":{"dur":5,"text":"So the viewer's forced to focus\non the feeling of the painting first,"},"723":{"dur":3,"text":"and then the content."},"726":{"dur":5,"text":"I wanted the viewer to feel the work,\nrather than see the work."},"731":{"dur":5,"text":"The work -- I started stripping out\nthe environment and just really dialed it in\nto the essential elements."},"737":{"dur":3,"text":"It's about her and what she's doing\nand where she's at."},"741":{"dur":1,"text":"Plain and simple."},"742":{"dur":3,"text":"Simplifying the concept,\nand simplifying the paintings."},"748":{"dur":6,"text":"And I was also interested in movement,\nthat came from the Panel Series, a lot like this --"},"754":{"dur":5,"text":"when I came back to the Waiting Series,\nI started incorporating different ideas\nthat I did in the other series."},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"Again, it's all one thing,"},"762":{"dur":7,"text":"because I'm who I am and you're who you are,\nso whatever you do as an artist,"},"770":{"dur":4,"text":"through experimentation and exploration, it's you."},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"I think the important thing is to be conscious\nof what you're doing and why you're doing it,"},"779":{"dur":3,"text":"and let those things merge together."},"782":{"dur":4,"text":"And not fear letting go of certain things\nand moving forward."},"787":{"dur":6,"text":"So these next two slides from 2007 to about 2010,"},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"the work was primarily high-key."},"795":{"dur":3,"text":"There's a lot of negative space, a lot of white."},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"You could say they were all daytime paintings."},"805":{"dur":7,"text":"When I went to school here, I learned everything\nthat I know up until 2005 from the Academy."},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"I didn't know about contemporary art, I didn't --"},"815":{"dur":4,"text":"I knew about contemporary,\nlike, studio art and fine art."},"820":{"dur":5,"text":"But I didn't know about contemporary art\nor lowbrow art or street art."},"825":{"dur":1,"text":"So when I got out of school,"},"827":{"dur":4,"text":"I started hanging out\nwith different types of artists."},"832":{"dur":2,"text":"Artists doing different types of art."},"835":{"dur":3,"text":"And some of those artists were street artists."},"838":{"dur":4,"text":"So, Waiters -- they started out on the street."},"842":{"dur":2,"text":"I had an idea of --"},"845":{"dur":8,"text":"I wanted to depict these people\nthat I was putting into the Waiting paintings,\nthe landscapes,"},"853":{"dur":5,"text":"because the people that I chose\nto put into these paintings\nwere usually overlooked in society."},"859":{"dur":3,"text":"So I wanted to paint them\non a monumental scale"},"862":{"dur":2,"text":"and put them back on the street\nwherever I took their picture,"},"865":{"dur":2,"text":"so the viewer's forced to give them attention."},"867":{"dur":4,"text":"So they started out as original oil paintings\nand latex on butcher paper,"},"872":{"dur":3,"text":"and I had to go back and put them on the street\nwhere I took their picture."},"875":{"dur":5,"text":"These are all about -- they range in size\nfrom seven to ten feet."},"881":{"dur":5,"text":"So it was a very short spurt of street art for me."},"887":{"dur":5,"text":"I realized I would spend a lot of time\non these butcher paper paintings,"},"892":{"dur":4,"text":"and they would be up for a couple of days,\nand then torn down."},"896":{"dur":2,"text":"So I started doing them on canvas."},"899":{"dur":3,"text":"So these are the first two I did on canvas."},"902":{"dur":1,"text":"And I stopped doing street art."},"904":{"dur":1,"text":"I never really called myself a street artist,"},"906":{"dur":3,"text":"I just kind of did it because I was\nhanging out with different street artists"},"909":{"dur":1,"text":"and it seemed like it was fun."},"911":{"dur":4,"text":"And it was fun, going out late at night\nand putting stuff up illegally, you know?"},"915":{"dur":5,"text":"Felt like I was a kid again,\nbreaking out of the house."},"921":{"dur":5,"text":"So I did the large figures for a little while\nand I started doing them really small."},"927":{"dur":5,"text":"These are about 4 by 5 1\/2 inches or so."},"932":{"dur":1,"text":"I did hundreds of these."},"934":{"dur":5,"text":"And then, I was still doing the Waiting Series --"},"940":{"dur":1,"text":"the Waiters and the Waiting Series are --"},"941":{"dur":4,"text":"the Waiters are somewhat of a subseries\nwithin the Waiting Series."},"946":{"dur":6,"text":"And all these places are -- this is Oakland,\nsome place in San Francisco --"},"953":{"dur":3,"text":"a lot of it is where I'm living at the time."},"956":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, I'm inspired by my environment."},"958":{"dur":2,"text":"That's what I choose to paint."},"961":{"dur":5,"text":"You can see the work is slowly starting\nto evolve into something else."},"966":{"dur":3,"text":"It's getting a little bit more abstract,"},"970":{"dur":6,"text":"I'm slowly detaching myself\nfrom academia, or technique."},"976":{"dur":5,"text":"So around 2010, I decided to do a shift,"},"982":{"dur":3,"text":"and I started doing these night paintings."},"985":{"dur":5,"text":"It's the same idea -- a lot of negative space,\nbut instead of white, I was using black."},"991":{"dur":1,"text":"These --"},"992":{"dur":6,"text":"if I really wanted to make a good living as an artist,\nI could just do these dark paintings,"},"999":{"dur":3,"text":"I'd probably be financially okay."},"1002":{"dur":4,"text":"These paintings sell quicker\nthan anything else I've ever done."},"1007":{"dur":6,"text":"So around 2012, I had a show\nin Newcastle, England,"},"1013":{"dur":2,"text":"and it was right around the time\nI got my first iPhone."},"1016":{"dur":4,"text":"These paintings were all\nin the show in England,"},"1020":{"dur":5,"text":"and the show was about technology\nand how it transforms our lives."},"1026":{"dur":6,"text":"Before, when I would have shows,\nI'd have to go out with a camera,"},"1032":{"dur":4,"text":"a point-and-shoot,\nwith an idea in mind and take pictures."},"1037":{"dur":2,"text":"Now that I had an iPhone\nin my pocket at all times,"},"1039":{"dur":4,"text":"I was able to capture my day-to-day life"},"1043":{"dur":6,"text":"or just what happens\non a day-to-day basis -- everyday."},"1049":{"dur":5,"text":"So this show was based on the iPhone\nand how it changes our lives"},"1055":{"dur":2,"text":"and adds to our lives, I guess --"},"1058":{"dur":7,"text":"but the work became more abstract\nand closer to the subjects,"},"1066":{"dur":5,"text":"because I was able to take candid photographs\nwithout people knowing what I was doing."},"1072":{"dur":5,"text":"In 2012, I started another series\nwithin the Waiting Series,"},"1077":{"dur":1,"text":"which was called Twenty-Four,"},"1078":{"dur":2,"text":"and the idea is to go to a city\nand spend a month there"},"1081":{"dur":5,"text":"and document twenty-four places\nthat represent neighborhoods,"},"1086":{"dur":3,"text":"places that are historical,\nlike iconic landmarks."},"1090":{"dur":4,"text":"The first place I did was San Francisco,\nbecause I live here."},"1094":{"dur":7,"text":"But the idea was to give the viewer\nan overall experience of the city that they live in."},"1102":{"dur":9,"text":"And I started incorporating photography,\nvideo installation, found objects, and painting."},"1111":{"dur":4,"text":"Once I found -- I would do a lot of --\nlike first, I would use social media,"},"1116":{"dur":2,"text":"if I went to a different city,\nI'd use social media,"},"1118":{"dur":1,"text":"I would reach out to like --"},"1120":{"dur":2,"text":"send out a message\non Facebook or Instagram --"},"1122":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't think Instagram was back then, but --"},"1125":{"dur":2,"text":"I would say, I'm in your city for one month,"},"1127":{"dur":2,"text":"if you know any places\nthat represent neighborhoods,\nplease let me know."},"1130":{"dur":3,"text":"And then people would start commenting\nand tell me to go check out different places,"},"1133":{"dur":5,"text":"and I'd also do a lot of reading and research,\nread historical books about the place that I was at."},"1139":{"dur":4,"text":"So I would go to these places that I had in mind,\nor people would suggest,"},"1144":{"dur":5,"text":"and I'd go to them at different times of the day,\nsee what time of day best suits the place."},"1150":{"dur":4,"text":"Once I found the place that fit the series,\nI would assign an hour out of the day to it"},"1154":{"dur":5,"text":"and then go back for the assigned hour\nand set up a video camera\nand shoot for that hour -- shoot a video."},"1160":{"dur":3,"text":"While I'd shoot a video for that hour,\nI'd collect stuff from the ground,"},"1163":{"dur":4,"text":"found objects, ephemera --\nthat is sort of the DNA of the place."},"1167":{"dur":2,"text":"It tells you who's in the area,\nwho lives there,"},"1170":{"dur":2,"text":"who's going to this place,"},"1173":{"dur":3,"text":"and I'd also take pictures with my iPhone\nand my point-and-shoot"},"1176":{"dur":4,"text":"while I was at that place for the assigned hour."},"1181":{"dur":3,"text":"After I gathered all the information,"},"1184":{"dur":5,"text":"usually take forty-eight hours of video\nand narrow it down to twenty-four places,"},"1190":{"dur":5,"text":"I would have a friend of mine put all the videos\ntogether into one frame,"},"1196":{"dur":4,"text":"so all the videos are playing simultaneously\nand it makes a complete day in that city."},"1200":{"dur":4,"text":"So it'd be 12:00 to 1:00 a.m., 1:00 to 2:00,\n2:00 to 3:00, all throughout the day,"},"1205":{"dur":3,"text":"twenty-four hours all playing at the same time,\ntwenty-four different places --"},"1208":{"dur":4,"text":"in the beginning I would\nchoose half to make paintings of."},"1213":{"dur":2,"text":"So half of the places I would turn into paintings,"},"1215":{"dur":6,"text":"and I would take the stuff that I collected at the place\nand put it on a pedestal underneath the painting,"},"1222":{"dur":2,"text":"and that sort of puts the painting in context."},"1225":{"dur":3,"text":"It tells you like -- the stuff that I collected,\nsay like in the Mission --"},"1229":{"dur":4,"text":"if I documented stuff in the Mission,\nthe stuff that I collect there"},"1233":{"dur":2,"text":"is going to be different than the stuff\nI collect in Chinatown."},"1235":{"dur":2,"text":"So it gives the viewer an idea\nof who's in the place, who lives there,"},"1238":{"dur":2,"text":"puts the painting in a certain context."},"1240":{"dur":5,"text":"And this is the press release from the first show,\nthat was at the Sandra Lee Gallery on Post Street."},"1246":{"dur":1,"text":"She's no longer there."},"1247":{"dur":3,"text":"And this series is still part of the Waiting Series,"},"1250":{"dur":5,"text":"I would title the paintings the name of the place,\nthe hour, the day, and then \"Waiting,\" with a number."},"1256":{"dur":3,"text":"Shaun Roberts also went to school here,\nbut he studied New Medium."},"1259":{"dur":7,"text":"He's an amazing photographer,\nvideographer, multimedia guy."},"1267":{"dur":5,"text":"So this shows you the painting\nand then the stuff that was collected underneath."},"1273":{"dur":1,"text":"Here

--"},"1743":{"dur":4,"text":"and threatened to beat my ass."},"1748":{"dur":5,"text":"So I figured out different ways --"},"1754":{"dur":3,"text":"more stealth tactics to document these

pack"},"1766":{"dur":3,"text":"and I would lock the bike up in front\nof the place that I was documenting."},"1770":{"dur":4,"text":"But after about twenty minutes being there,\npeople start to wonder

time."},"1782":{"dur":1,"text":"People start to notice you."},"1783":{"dur":5,"text":"And I did the same thing when I was in London --\nI used the bike technique."},"1789":{"dur":7,"text":"When I documented for Twenty-Four Los Angeles,\nthe show was canceled, so I [unclear]."},"1796":{"dur":5,"text":"I came up with a different idea,\nwhich was where -- it worked great."},"1802":{"dur":5,"text":"I bought a survey camera, and I gutted it out\nand I put the camera inside that,"},"1807":{"dur":6,"text":"and then I got a construction outfit\nand that was -- people didn't even question it."},"1814":{"dur":3,"text":"That was perfect."},"1817":{"dur":4,"text":"And I had a collector of mine,\nhe came up from San Diego\nand he hung out with me for about a week,"},"1822":{"dur":5,"text":"and he used to dress in the outfit, too,\nand we would have a camera documenting us,"},"1827":{"dur":6,"text":"because at that point,\nit kind of becomes a performative piece."},"1833":{"dur":6,"text":"So we'd have a camera documenting us\nand then we'd have another camera\ninside the survey camera machine,"},"1840":{"dur":3,"text":"and  people would ask us what we were doing --"},"1844":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Yeah, we're surveying.\""},"1845":{"dur":1,"text":"\"What are you surveying?\""},"1847":{"dur":1,"text":"\"The land

back down to the survey.\""},"1856":{"dur":1,"text":"So you could basically tell people whatever --"},"1858":{"dur":3,"text":"if you look like you're legit\nand you're supposed to be there,"},"1861":{"dur":1,"text":"people just accept it."},"1864":{"dur":2,"text":"This is London tube, the red lines --"},"1867":{"dur":3,"text":"so there's a map above it that shows the line."},"1870":{"dur":6,"text":"and then these are -- I recorded video\nand also sound with this piece."},"1877":{"dur":3,"text":"So you can hear the hour of the train."},"1881":{"dur":3,"text":"I rode the train line from beginning to end,"},"1885":{"dur":2,"text":"and I recorded the sound."},"1887":{"dur":5,"text":"And then these are all the different Oyster cards\nand different passes that I collected"},"1892":{"dur":3,"text":"throughout the month while I was there."},"1895":{"dur":5,"text":"And then this is where I stayed at --\nI stayed in -- where did I stay?"},"1901":{"dur":2,"text":"Over by Brick Lane,"},"1904":{"dur":1,"text":"and there were --"},"1905":{"dur":3,"text":"a lot of kids in the building that I stayed in,"},"1909":{"dur":3,"text":"and every day they would play in this courtyard"},"1912":{"dur":1,"text":"and the elders would go out there and watch them,"},"1914":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'd usually be out all night, documenting."},"1917":{"dur":3,"text":"So they'd always wake me up around two o'clock."},"1921":{"dur":5,"text":"So the headphones --\nyou can hear the kids playing."},"1926":{"dur":4,"text":"And then these are toys and stuff\nthat they kind of left around the premises --"},"1931":{"dur":1,"text":"just discarded toys."},"1932":{"dur":7,"text":"And this is like a clothesline --\nthat's how they were drying their clothes."},"1940":{"dur":4,"text":"And then this particular piece --"},"1944":{"dur":5,"text":"so in the '40s, when we were at war,\nLondon was being bombed,"},"1950":{"dur":5,"text":"so there's a train station called Bethnal Green,\nand I think it was 1943 -- they sounded the alarm,"},"1956":{"dur":4,"text":"and it was a test, but people didn't know\nit was a test, and they flipped out."},"1960":{"dur":3,"text":"They ran down into the train station\nand then panicked,"},"1963":{"dur":5,"text":"and hundreds of people just started running,\nand a little girl tripped,"},"1968":{"dur":5,"text":"and I think eighty women and children died --\ntrampled to death."},"1974":{"dur":6,"text":"So this is a memorial for what happened."},"1980":{"dur":3,"text":"I was out there in, I think --\nalso March, documenting --"},"1984":{"dur":2,"text":"and then I went back in July for the show,"},"1986":{"dur":2,"text":"and when I went back there, build a memorial --"},"1989":{"dur":1,"text":"but they had to stop."},"1990":{"dur":2,"text":"They didn't complete it because\nthey ran out of funding."},"1993":{"dur":3,"text":"So the gallery -- they have a print

get the proceeds\nto help them finish the memorial."},"2011":{"dur":3,"text":"This is like a smaller installation."},"2018":{"dur":3,"text":"And then this is a newsstand."},"2022":{"dur":5,"text":"These are portraits of people that I saw\nwhen I was in London --"},"2027":{"dur":4,"text":"but they're sort of ... it's a progression\ninto the Anonymous Series,"},"2032":{"dur":1,"text":"they're not from passport photographs,"},"2034":{"dur":6,"text":"but doing these portraits\nand kind of in an abstract approach"},"2040":{"dur":4,"text":"kind of transitioned me later\nfor the Anonymous Series."},"2045":{"dur":2,"text":"That's the direction\nthe Anonymous Series goes in."},"2048":{"dur":3,"text":"And then this guy was at Ridley Market."},"2051":{"dur":3,"text":"So I went back when I was there\nand I bought all this stuff from him --"},"2059":{"dur":1,"text":"just hung it on the outside of the painting."},"2061":{"dur":2,"text":"Some of it's painting, some of it's actual objects."},"2063":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's kind of a nod to Thomas Wesselmann,"},"2067":{"dur":3,"text":"and some of the

there's more of these portraits on this --"},"2105":{"dur":3,"text":"this is a printout mounted to wood cradle --"},"2109":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a place in Hackney, it's a council house

Here."},"2130":{"dur":8,"text":"So what happened -- this particular area\nof Hackney is facing gentrification, so --"},"2139":{"dur":4,"text":"this particular council house management\nstopped taking care of the building."},"2144":{"dur":2,"text":"And they stopped taking care of the tenants."},"2146":{"dur":3,"text":"And they're trying to get people to move out,"},"2150":{"dur":3,"text":"or force

documentary,\nand the documentary had to stop, again,"},"2164":{"dur":2,"text":"halfway through production\nbecause they ran out of funding,"},"2166":{"dur":1,"text":"so I got in touch with

story."},"2194":{"dur":8,"text":"So around 2014, I started doing more installations,\nbut they're still -- they still incorporated painting."},"2203":{"dur":3,"text":"They weren't pure installations

was just driving around trying to find places."},"2271":{"dur":3,"text":"And I came across this place and asked the owner\nif I could rent a room."},"2275":{"dur":2,"text":"And he wouldn't let me rent a room."},"2277":{"dur":2,"text":"It's like -- weird, weird people."},"2280":{"dur":1,"text":"[Students laugh]"},"2282":{"dur":3,"text":"So I came back the following week\nand asked if I could rent a

the sound and the blinking light\nset the mood for the piece."},"2369":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, it makes the piece completely."},"2372":{"dur":4,"text":"This was at Art Market a couple years ago, 2014."},"2377":{"dur":6,"text":"So I came back to the Anonymous Series\nin 2015 and the idea kind of changed a little bit."},"2383":{"dur":8,"text":"I was -- before I was sort of doing\nthese character-based paintings\nof these passport photographs."},"2391":{"dur":2,"text":"And when I came back to the series,"},"2393":{"dur":10,"text":"the work got more abstract\nand it was about catching

them."},"2409":{"dur":2,"text":"This was one piece."},"2414":{"dur":6,"text":"They're all about 4 x 5 1\/2 inches."},"2420":{"dur":2,"text":"Or 4 1\/2 by 5 inches."},"2424":{"dur":6,"text":"So 2015, I

May."},"2448":{"dur":6,"text":"and then I went out there in May,\nand took about ten thousand pictures in ten days."},"2454":{"dur":2,"text":"And I spent six weeks working."},"2457":{"dur":4,"text":"I spent most of the year reading\nand developing the ideas"},"2461":{"dur":5,"text":"and figuring out the historical relevance\nof the area for that particular time."},"2467":{"dur":3,"text":"And twenty
