you"},"159":{"dur":3,"text":"just, you just had this fire about getting\nstarted."},"162":{"dur":2,"text":"So talk about the early bid of getting started."},"164":{"dur":2,"text":">>Premal Shah: Sure,

today."},"324":{"dur":5,"text":"So, it started with sophomore slump and I\ndiscovered microfinance in a class."},"329":{"dur":4,"text":"And what I loved about microfinance was it\nwas a business

used"},"558":{"dur":1,"text":"it."},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"They were so pissed that I left like a good\ncareer job at PayPal"},"562":{"dur":1,"text":"[Laughter]\n>>Premal Shah: for like a non-profit

exactly."},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"So when you get something started it\u00eds really\nhard to get the traction."},"574":{"dur":6,"text":"And the moment that kind of changed everything\nwas about a year into our existence."},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"We were volunteers for about 7 months and\nthen we knew we had to start putting people"},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"on to healthcare and at least paying

Shah: And it was so painful for the"},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"next 4 days our site couldn\u00edt get back up."},"656":{"dur":3,"text":"But, of course, on the internet when your\nsite crashes it actually builds the meme."},"660":{"dur":1,"text":">>Gary Briggs: Yeah."},"661":{"dur":4,"text":">>Premal Shah: So that, right there, more\nthan anything and, in fact, one of our engineers,"},"665":{"dur":3,"text":"he basically put up a little PayPal button\nthat said, \u00ecYou\u00edve melted our servers, help"},"669":{"dur":1,"text":"us buy new

Shah: So that was that moment in\ntime that then, from that point, you know,"},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"um, things really started taking off"},"690":{"dur":1,"text":">>Gary Briggs: Yeah"},"691":{"dur":1,"text":">>Premal Shah: and people, the word started\nspreading."},"692":{"dur":1,"text":">>Gary Briggs: Yeah."},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"I have to admit I was imaging you four

you mentioned about Grameen and\na little bit of microfinance."},"708":{"dur":3,"text":"How does it work, how do you even get started?"},"711":{"dur":3,"text":">>Premal Shah: Sure, just by show of

How many of you actually have\nmoney sitting in your Kiva accounts that you"},"720":{"dur":2,"text":"have to respend or relend to someone?"},"723":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay, there\u00eds about 25 million dollars sitting\nin people\u00eds Kiva accounts that could be in"},"727":{"dur":1,"text":"the hands of the working poor."},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"So, just keep coming back and relending that\nmoney."},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"And we\u00edve just built an auto loan feature\nthat allows you to automatically deploy it."},"735":{"dur":4,"text":"But I wanna walk through the user experience\nof the website for those of you who haven\u00edt"},"740":{"dur":1,"text":"used it."},"741":{"dur":8,"text":"So, essentially, you come to the website and\nyou can go to our lend tab and, essentially,"},"749":{"dur":5,"text":"we feature some loans across the top, like,\ngroup loans, um, that typically go to poorer"},"755":{"dur":1,"text":"microfinance clients."},"756":{"dur":7,"text":"Right now we\u00edre featuring Arab youth loans,\nthey tend to be slower to fund sometimes on"},"763":{"dur":1,"text":"our website."},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"We find that women fund faster than men."},"767":{"dur":9,"text":"Anyway, you can sift through, and, the site\nand, I don\u00edt know, let\u00eds pick T\u00c8l\u00c8 in"},"777":{"dur":5,"text":"Togo who wants a thousand dollars to purchase\nbeverages."},"782":{"dur":8,"text":"And, so basically what you can do is read\na little bit about T\u00c8l\u00c8."},"790":{"dur":6,"text":"She\u00eds posted by a Kiva field partner, and\nthis is what we do, Kiva is a non-profit organization"},"797":{"dur":1,"text":"based in San Francisco."},"798":{"dur":5,"text":"We have about 90 staff members around the\nworld and a big part of what we do is we go"},"803":{"dur":9,"text":"and find organizations like WAGES, here, and\nwe basically look at their social performance,"},"813":{"dur":5,"text":"their work in the community and we give them\nsome kind of public badging and then we assign"},"818":{"dur":1,"text":"them a risk rating."},"820":{"dur":5,"text":"So 1 to 5 star risk rating, if you\u00edre a 5\nstar organization you can raise over a million"},"826":{"dur":3,"text":"dollars from the internet community on the\nplatform, if you\u00edre one star we start you"},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"off at 25,000 dollars."},"832":{"dur":3,"text":"So it\u00eds a way of basically allowing these\norganizations, we\u00edre giving them visibility"},"836":{"dur":4,"text":"and voice to basically raise money so they\ncan reach more entrepreneurs in their community."},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"So they\u00edre the real heroes at Kiva."},"843":{"dur":4,"text":"They\u00edre the ones who are doing the hard work\nevery single day on the ground in over 60"},"847":{"dur":1,"text":"countries."},"848":{"dur":3,"text":"So they\u00edve been on the Kiva platform for\n50 months and they\u00edve posted up nearly four"},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"thousand entrepreneurs onto the website."},"854":{"dur":5,"text":"Anyways, oh, and we use Google Maps right\nhere and you can kind of see where people"},"860":{"dur":8,"text":"from around the world have lent to this borrower."},"868":{"dur":9,"text":"So, anyways, the way it works is, it\u00eds pretty\nsimple, you can lend 25 dollars or more and"},"877":{"dur":6,"text":"if you hit lend 25 one of the big questions\nthat we often get is, \u00ecHow does Kiva pay"},"884":{"dur":5,"text":"for the rent and for salaries?\u00ee About 60\npercent of how we make our money is through"},"889":{"dur":1,"text":"tips."},"890":{"dur":4,"text":"So, like, when you go to a restaurant you\ntip a waiter an extra 15 percent, we ask you"},"895":{"dur":5,"text":"to kind of throw in an extra 15 percent on\ntop of your 25 dollar loan."},"900":{"dur":8,"text":"And, on average, you know, we get about 7\npercent, so about half the people stiff us."},"909":{"dur":7,"text":"But, you know, it\u00eds those tips as well as\nkind of donations from foundations, corporations"},"917":{"dur":4,"text":"and individuals that allow us to kind of expand\ninto some of the hardest to reach places on"},"921":{"dur":1,"text":"the planet."},"923":{"dur":4,"text":"And then a cool thing about Kiva is that it\u00eds\na loan not a donation."},"927":{"dur":4,"text":"And usually every month, so the average loan\nterm on Kiva is about 10 months and you get"},"931":{"dur":1,"text":"paid back in monthly installments."},"933":{"dur":4,"text":"So, if you lend 25 dollars you\u00edll get 2 dollars\nand 50 cents emailed back to you every month"},"938":{"dur":5,"text":"and that lands in your account as Kiva credit\nand then once you get 25 dollars back you"},"943":{"dur":3,"text":"can turn around and withdraw that money or\nyou can relend it."},"947":{"dur":3,"text":"Most people choose to relend their money to\nanother entrepreneur."},"951":{"dur":4,"text":"So that\u00eds the basics of the Kiva user experience\nand then, you know, often times you\u00edll get"},"956":{"dur":3,"text":"an update on how the entrepreneur\u00eds business\nis doing."},"959":{"dur":4,"text":"And it\u00eds not always good news, sometimes\nbusinesses fail."},"963":{"dur":5,"text":"But it\u00eds, what we wanna do is try to just\nmake, give a window into the world and make"},"968":{"dur":2,"text":"it as accessible and easy as possible."},"970":{"dur":5,"text":"People participate as a business partners\nnot necessarily as a, you know, I\u00edm your"},"976":{"dur":2,"text":"benefactor and you\u00edre my beneficiary but\nreally a partnership relationship."},"979":{"dur":5,"text":">>Gary Briggs: Talk a
