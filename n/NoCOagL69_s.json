it."},"632":{"dur":4,"text":"But there are two important mitigating factors here."},"637":{"dur":3,"text":"The first is that by definition,"},"640":{"dur":5,"text":"this money printed would be spent

U.K. and Japan."},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"To match the aid payments made"},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"by those governments over the last four years,"},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"Print Aid would have generated"},"685":{"dur":4,"text":"200 billion dollars' worth of extra aid."},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"What would that look like"},"692":{"dur":3,"text":"in the context of the increase in the money

this?"},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"You might struggle to see that at the back,"},"705":{"dur":3,"text":"because the gap is quite small."},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"So what we're saying here"},"711":{"dur":3,"text":"is that we took a $3.7 trillion gamble"},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"to save our financial systems,"},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"and you know what, it paid off."},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"There was no inflation."},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"Are we really saying that it's not worth the risk"},"725":{"dur":4,"text":"to print an extra 200 billion for aid?"},"730":{"dur":1,"text":"Would the risks really be that different?"},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"To me, it's not that clear."},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"What is clear is the impact on aid."},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"Even though this is the printing"},"740":{"dur":1,"text":"of just three central banks,"},"741":{"dur":3,"text":"the global aid that's given"},"745":{"dur":4,"text":"over

scheme."},"766":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think what we've learned"},"770":{"dur":4,"text":"is that the risks from this money creation scheme"},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"are quite modest,"},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"but the benefits"},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"are potentially huge."},"782":{"dur":3,"text":"Imagine what we could do\nwith 40 percent more
