confidence, these"},"515":{"dur":4,"text":"are all things that are\nworthwhile of themselves."},"520":{"dur":3,"text":"The second reason is that\nhe has a real interest in"},"523":{"dur":6,"text":"getting more young people to\nget excited about STEM, and"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"advanced manufacturing,\nand design."},"532":{"dur":3,"text":"And one of the problems that\nwe have in education is that"},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"students get bored."},"537":{"dur":5,"text":"A lot of them check out as\nthey go from primary, to"},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"middle, to high school, and\nthey don't understand what"},"545":{"dur":4,"text":"the relevance of, you know,\nwhat their learning is, and"},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"just being told, \"Oh, it's\ngoing to be on the test,"},"552":{"dur":6,"text":"that's why,\" is not a\nterribly compelling reason"},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"for a lot of\npeople to learning."},"561":{"dur":4,"text":"So, that if they understand\nwhat the connections are"},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"between something that\nthey're interested in,"},"567":{"dur":3,"text":"something that they find\nintrinsically motivating,"},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"then they're going to work\na lot harder, and they're"},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"going to do better."},"575":{"dur":5,"text":"And you know, whether they\ndecide to go on to a career"},"580":{"dur":6,"text":"or pursue college, this is\nsomething they can get more"},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"young people interested, and\nreally see the"},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"relevance of this."},"590":{"dur":5,"text":"And Carl Bass who's the CEO\nof Autodesk calls this \"just"},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"in time,\" as opposed\nto just in case."},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"So, just in case, you know,\nyou're learning trigonometry"},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"because maybe five years\nfrom now you're going to"},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"have to use trigonometry."},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"Just in time is there's some\nproblem that you're super"},"610":{"dur":3,"text":"excited about solving, and\nthere's something that"},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"you're going to learn right\naway that is going to allow"},"616":{"dur":1,"text":"you to solve that problem."},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"So, that's the second reason\nthat we're excited about this."},"619":{"dur":5,"text":"The third reason has to\ndo with innovation, and"},"627":{"dur":4,"text":"entrepreneurship, and the\nrevitalization of American"},"631":{"dur":4,"text":"manufacturing, and we've got\na number of the leaders from"},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"the Small Business\nAdministration and the"},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"Department of Commerce who\nwere here, who helped drive"},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"our agenda on innovation\nand entrepreneurship."},"644":{"dur":5,"text":"And one of the reasons that\nthere's so much innovation"},"649":{"dur":4,"text":"in the digital world is that\nthe cost of doing a startup"},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"has plummeted."},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"It used to be that if you\nwanted to do a startup, you"},"657":{"dur":3,"text":"would have to raise millions\nof dollars, and go out, and"},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"buy a bunch of\nexpensive servers."},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"And pay for a\nlot of licenses."},"668":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, because of things like\nopen source software and the"},"672":{"dur":6,"text":"cloud, a startup may be\nseveral people living on"},"678":{"dur":5,"text":"Ramen noodles for several\nmonths, and developing a"},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"minimum viable\nproduct of their idea."},"685":{"dur":5,"text":"And then, being able to get\nvery early feedback from"},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"customers about whether\nthey've created something"},"693":{"dur":1,"text":"that the people want."},"694":{"dur":4,"text":"So, whenever you lower\nthe barriers to entry to"},"699":{"dur":3,"text":"something, whenever you make\nsomething less expensive and"},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"easier, people\nwill do more of it."},"704":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, the question is\nwhether the Maker Movement"},"708":{"dur":4,"text":"provides that opportunity\nnot only in the digital"},"712":{"dur":3,"text":"world, but in the physical\nworld, and in the growing"},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"convergence between the\ndigital and the physical world."},"718":{"dur":5,"text":"So, in some cities for the\ncost of a gym membership you"},"723":{"dur":4,"text":"can get access to $1 million\nworth of machine tools, and"},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"the training needed to\nuse computer numerically"},"730":{"dur":3,"text":"controlled machine tools,\nand laser cutters, and 3-D"},"733":{"dur":3,"text":"printers, and something that\ncan cut through three inches"},"737":{"dur":1,"text":"of steel."},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, if you have an idea,\nyou can develop a prototype"},"742":{"dur":5,"text":"for that, and then perhaps\nuse crowdfunding in order to"},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"be able to mobilize the\nresources that you need to"},"751":{"dur":1,"text":"launch that."},"753":{"dur":3,"text":"So, that's another reason\nis that it's lowering the"},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"barriers to entry in the\nphysical world in the same"},"760":{"dur":3,"text":"way that arguably the\ninternet, and cloud"},"763":{"dur":3,"text":"computing, and open source\nsoftware have done so in the"},"767":{"dur":1,"text":"digital world."},"769":{"dur":3,"text":"And finally, as you saw from\nthat great video which is a"},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"make-a-thon that was\norganized by an Israeli"},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"nonprofit organization\ncalled Tikkun Olam Maker,"},"778":{"dur":4,"text":"which is Hebrew for Makers\nRepairing the World, is a"},"783":{"dur":5,"text":"collaboration between makers\nand people with disabilities"},"788":{"dur":7,"text":"who were co-designing\nsolutions that people with"},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"disabilities face, like you\nknow, being able to open up"},"798":{"dur":2,"text":"a door, or get in and\nout of a wheelchair."},"801":{"dur":1,"text":"And so, I think the fourth\nreason is that the Maker"},"803":{"dur":3,"text":"Movement increases the\nnumber of problem solvers."},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"It increases the number of\npeople who can look at a"},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"problem like that of\nimproving the quality of"},"811":{"dur":2,"text":"life for people with\ndisabilities or building a"},"814":{"dur":3,"text":"more sustainable economy, or\ngetting more young people"},"818":{"dur":4,"text":"excited about STEM, and\ndesign, and"},"822":{"dur":1,"text":"advanced manufacturing."},"823":{"dur":4,"text":"And have the skills and\nthe creative confidence to"},"828":{"dur":3,"text":"co-design solutions to those\nchallenges that we face."},"831":{"dur":2,"text":"So, those are the reasons\nwhy we think this is so"},"834":{"dur":3,"text":"important, and why this is\nsomething that the President"},"837":{"dur":1,"text":"has been promoting."},"839":{"dur":4,"text":"The last thing I want to\ntalk about is the role --"},"843":{"dur":2,"text":"this taking the notion\nof the Maker Movement"},"845":{"dur":3,"text":"literally, as opposed to\nit just being a figure of"},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"speech, and if you think\nabout what it is that"},"851":{"dur":3,"text":"movements do,\nthey have a goal."},"855":{"dur":4,"text":"So, you know, if the\nenvironmental movement is"},"859":{"dur":4,"text":"interested in how we\npreserve the environment for"},"863":{"dur":3,"text":"future generations, how do\nwe have an economy that"},"867":{"dur":5,"text":"grows and creates jobs, but\ndo so in a way that, you"},"873":{"dur":4,"text":"know, reduces greenhouse\ngases, for example, and I"},"877":{"dur":4,"text":"think that an example of a\ngoal that the Maker Movement"},"882":{"dur":3,"text":"could rally behind is how\ndo we make these types of"},"885":{"dur":3,"text":"experiences available for\nmore people, and you know,"},"889":{"dur":3,"text":"particularly for\nyoung people."},"892":{"dur":3,"text":"So, that's one thing that\nmovements have, is that they"},"896":{"dur":3,"text":"have a goal, and the second\nthing is that they have some"},"899":{"dur":4,"text":"lightweight infrastructure\nfor increasing the number of"},"904":{"dur":2,"text":"individuals and\norganizations that"},"906":{"dur":1,"text":"get involved."},"907":{"dur":5,"text":"So you know, if you think\nabout the question of how"},"912":{"dur":6,"text":"would we make this available\nfor more young people, you"},"919":{"dur":2,"text":"would want to have spaces in\nschools, and after"},"921":{"dur":1,"text":"school programs."},"922":{"dur":2,"text":"You would want to have\ntools and materials."},"924":{"dur":2,"text":"You would want to have\nmentors that can help"},"926":{"dur":2,"text":"students work on\nprogressively more"},"928":{"dur":3,"text":"challenging projects, and\nthat's not something that"},"932":{"dur":2,"text":"any one individual or\norganization could do."},"935":{"dur":3,"text":"But I really believe that at\nthe local and regional level"},"939":{"dur":5,"text":"that people could expand the\nnumber of individuals and"},"944":{"dur":2,"text":"organizations that are\nparticipating, that are"},"946":{"dur":5,"text":"providing financial, or any\nkind of support, or lending"},"951":{"dur":3,"text":"their expertise, or being\na mentor to a teacher"},"955":{"dur":1,"text":"or a student."},"956":{"dur":2,"text":"So, that's what I would like\nyou to think about, not only"},"958":{"dur":3,"text":"today but when you go back\nto your communities, is how"},"961":{"dur":4,"text":"do you take this phrase of\nmaker movement and increase"},"969":{"dur":2,"text":"the number of people that\nare involved, whether it's"},"972":{"dur":4,"text":"the leadership of schools\nand afterschool programs,"},"976":{"dur":2,"text":"you know, you shouldn't take\nit for granted that they've"},"978":{"dur":3,"text":"ever heard of this, or\nnecessarily understand why"},"981":{"dur":4,"text":"it is potentially related\nto education, and lifelong"},"985":{"dur":2,"text":"learning, and\nworkforce development."},"988":{"dur":4,"text":"How do we get more\nfoundations, and libraries,"},"992":{"dur":1,"text":"and museums?"},"994":{"dur":4,"text":"One of the things that is in\nthe packet that Andrew put"},"998":{"dur":2,"text":"together is a number of\ncommitments that different"},"1001":{"dur":2,"text":"types of organizations\nhave made."},"1003":{"dur":2,"text":"So for example, a number\nof universities have said,"},"1005":{"dur":2,"text":"\"We're going to promote\nthis on our campus.\""},"1007":{"dur":4,"text":"So, Case Western Reserve\nUniversity is investing in

level."},"1037":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I really believe that\nthere is a broad coalition"},"1041":{"dur":3,"text":"that is increasingly seeing\nboth how they can benefit"},"1044":{"dur":3,"text":"from and contribute to this\neffort, and I hope when you"},"1048":{"dur":4,"text":"return to your cities, and\ntowns, and communities that"},"1052":{"dur":3,"text":"you'll stay in touch with\nus, that you'll let us know"},"1056":{"dur":5,"text":"how we can help, and that\nyou will work in your own"},"1061":{"dur":2,"text":"community to expand the\nnumber of people and"},"1064":{"dur":3,"text":"organizations that is\nexcited about this, is aware"},"1067":{"dur":3,"text":"of it, and is taking\nconcrete steps to expand the"},"1071":{"dur":2,"text":"number of people, young\nand old, that have an"},"1073":{"dur":1,"text":"opportunity to participate."},"1075":{"dur":4,"text":"So, have a great day, and\nI'm really looking forward"},"1079":{"dur":3,"text":"to the awesome ideas that I\nknow you're going to come up"},"1083":{"dur":2,"text":"with, to take the Maker\nMovement to the next level."},"1085":{"dur":0,"text":"So, no
