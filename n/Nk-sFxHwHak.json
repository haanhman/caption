a really\nnegative reaction to it"},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"whereas in this part, in this country,"},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"the austerity party was the out party."},"431":{"dur":1,"text":"So I think you have an\ninteresting sort of inversion"},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"of what was taking place in Great Britain"},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"where the Democrats came\nin and their prescription"},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"for fixing the economic collapse"},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"was some austerity,\nbecause you had this push"},"442":{"dur":1,"text":"on the right to have austerity,"},"444":{"dur":1,"text":"to cut government,"},"446":{"dur":1,"text":"in much the way that was taking place"},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"particularly in Great\nBritain, I'm thinking of."},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"But you had a president\nwho was on the other side"},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"of that argument and so you\nhad a more limited austerity."},"455":{"dur":3,"text":"So I do think you do have\nsome residual energy,"},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"particularly on the left of the Party,"},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"because liberals in the Democratic Party"},"462":{"dur":1,"text":"have been an out group"},"463":{"dur":1,"text":"within the Democratic Party for so long."},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"There's been this project of more than,"},"467":{"dur":1,"text":"really 40 years of trying

Party."},"518":{"dur":1,"text":"And so I think it is interesting"},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"that you have seen the left come back"},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"in a huge way during the Obama era"},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"and they've come back\nparticularly on social issues"},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"like gay marriage and win on those issues"},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"and actually not just win the day,"},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"but really win the argument\nand really have the country"},"533":{"dur":1,"text":"sort of come in their direction."},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"But there is this feeling\nthat one of the great,"},"536":{"dur":3,"text":"sort of, unfinished projects that the left"},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"has in front of it in this resurgence"},"543":{"dur":1,"text":"is to deal with economic reform,"},"544":{"dur":1,"text":"to deal with economic fairness,"},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"and to deal with the wealth gap"},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"and I think that's why\nyou see so much energy."},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a different kind of populist energy."},"552":{"dur":3,"text":"The energy on the right, I would argue,"},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"is partly about economic insecurity,"},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"which you can see whenever there's periods"},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"of economic insecurity there\nis anti-immigration sentiment."},"562":{"dur":1,"text":"Those kind of sentiments bubble up"},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"and I think that is part of it too."},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"But it's also a reaction\nto the cultural move left"},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that the country has undergone,"},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that's part of the\nappeal of Donald Trump too."},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"It's sort of reacting against"},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"this sort of politically\ncorrect multiculturalism"},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"of the Obama era,"},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that's mixed up in it too,"},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"but there is also obviously\neconomic populism."},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"But the third thing I'll say briefly"},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"is that I think it's also a\nreaction to the Republican Party"},"587":{"dur":1,"text":"and the way they've made their argument"},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"to their own base."},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"They've argued that they\ncan completely reverse"},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"the Obama era."},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"That if you just give them\nthe House and the Senate"},"595":{"dur":1,"text":"they'll reverse healthcare reform."},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"They will reverse\neverything that Obama did."},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"And since Barack Obama, the body of him,"},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"the person of him is so offensive"},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"to so many people in the\nbase of the Republican Party."},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"The failure of Republicans to win,"},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"to just win when they're\nin arguments against him"},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"I think has hurt them\nand then the donor class"},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"of the Republican Party\nessentially telling"},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"its own base, not only are\nwe not going to deliver"},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"on one of the things\nyou're most insecure about"},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"which is stopping illegal immigration,"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"unlawful migration, we're\nactually gonna tell you"},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"you're not even supposed to want that."},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"We are gonna tell you what's best for you"},"628":{"dur":0,"text":"and that is we're gonna do"},"629":{"dur":1,"text":"a comprehensive immigration reform"},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"and that donor class breach\nwith the base of the Party"},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"I think is the third thing that's created"},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"this movement toward these\nout-group type of candidates."},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"- You know, Reihan, a lot of liberals"},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"look at Trump and maybe Carson too,"},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"and then what's happening\nin the Republican Party say,"},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"okay, we know what's going on, basically,"},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"there are a bunch of older white people"},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"who are really, really\nupset that the country"},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"is becoming more minority\nand that it's becoming"},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"pro gay and that it's\nbecoming more secular,"},"658":{"dur":0,"text":"and they just can't deal with the fact"},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"that it's not the 1950s anymore."},"662":{"dur":1,"text":"And maybe there's some\neconomic insecurity,"},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"but basically they just can't\ndeal with 21st century America"},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"and they're in revolt against twenty"},"668":{"dur":1,"text":"and this political correctness thing"},"669":{"dur":1,"text":"is basically a way of saying like,"},"671":{"dur":1,"text":"why can't we get it back to the old days"},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"when people like us\nwere running everything"},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"and when we represented the American norm?"},"677":{"dur":4,"text":"Now I know liberals don't\nalways entirely accurately"},"681":{"dur":3,"text":"perceive what's happening\ninside conservative circles,"},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"but I just, I wanted\nto throw that out there"},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"because I think that is a\nidea, a mean that's out there"},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"on the left and I wanted you to say"},"691":{"dur":1,"text":"to what degree do you\nthink it has any merit"},"693":{"dur":1,"text":"and what it gets wrong."},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"- Well, I think that it's\nimportant to keep in mind"},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"that the Carson phenomenon\nand the Trump Phenomenon"},"699":{"dur":1,"text":"are, in fact, pretty distinct."},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"They are definitely both\noutsider candidates,"},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"but Ben Carson has gained an\nenormous amount of support"},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"from lots of evangelical voters,"},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"religiously devout voters."},"711":{"dur":1,"text":"In previous elections,\nmany of these voters"},"713":{"dur":1,"text":"gravitated to Rick Santorum."},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"They gravitated to Mike Huckabee"},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"and even further back to\nlet's say, Pat Robertson,"},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"but this has long been a\nconstituency within the Party"},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"and Ben Carson speaks to them"},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"and I think there are lots of\nfairly understandable reasons"},"725":{"dur":1,"text":"why he does speak to them."},"726":{"dur":1,"text":"He's someone who wears\nhis faith on his sleeve."},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"He's very articulate on these matters"},"730":{"dur":1,"text":"and he's very passionate about them."},"732":{"dur":1,"text":"Whereas Donald Trump, if\nyou look at his support,"},"734":{"dur":1,"text":"it's pretty striking."},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"His supporters, actually he's\ndisproportionally supported"},"738":{"dur":1,"text":"by more moderates, self-described"},"740":{"dur":1,"text":"moderate Republican voters."},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"He is supported by more\nsecular Republican voters."},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"And also, again, I want\nus to kind of zoom out"},"747":{"dur":1,"text":"and really think about this."},"749":{"dur":3,"text":"So again, in Sweden,\nabout 25% of the country"},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"backs this kind of anti-immigration,"},"755":{"dur":1,"text":"hard-right political Party."},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"In the United States about 24%"},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"of the, let's say, 35% of people"},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"identify as Republicans\nsupport Donald Trump."},"764":{"dur":1,"text":"And, of course, when we look at that"},"766":{"dur":1,"text":"it's actually pretty striking,"},"767":{"dur":0,"text":"because the number of Republicans"},"768":{"dur":1,"text":"that say they would never\nsupport Donald Trump"},"770":{"dur":2,"text":"under any circumstances,\nis also quite high."},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"And also, it's not clear\nhow robust or durable"},"776":{"dur":1,"text":"that support for Donald Trump is"},"778":{"dur":1,"text":"as people get a better sense of who he is,"},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"What I do think is absolutely\nright in what you've said,"},"783":{"dur":4,"text":"is that immigration is\nthe issue that Trump has,"},"788":{"dur":3,"text":"on which he's built a big constituency."},"791":{"dur":2,"text":"It was one of many\nthings that he brought up"},"793":{"dur":1,"text":"when he announced his campaign,"},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"but it's the one thing\nthat really resonated,"},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"partly because there was\nsuch a sharp backlash"},"800":{"dur":2,"text":"to his remarks from the media,"},"802":{"dur":1,"text":"from the wider public."},"804":{"dur":1,"text":"He just said a series of things"},"805":{"dur":1,"text":"that were really inflammatory,"},"807":{"dur":1,"text":"but I do think that it's true"},"808":{"dur":2,"text":"that the way that we\ntalk about immigration,"},"811":{"dur":1,"text":"let's say at the elite level,"},"813":{"dur":1,"text":"versus the way that we talk\nabout it at the popular level,"},"815":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that there's a big disconnect."},"816":{"dur":1,"text":"There's also a big disconnect"},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"in terms of how we talk about\nthis issue more broadly,"},"820":{"dur":1,"text":"so for example, we've had a debate,"},"822":{"dur":1,"text":"something that Donald Trump has\nreally brought to the floor,"},"824":{"dur":1,"text":"but we've had the debate\nover the past few months"},"826":{"dur":1,"text":"about birthright citizenship,"},"827":{"dur":1,"text":"that is the fact that the United States"},"829":{"dur":1,"text":"is one of only a small handful"},"831":{"dur":2,"text":"of affluent countries\nthat grants citizenship"},"834":{"dur":1,"text":"to anyone born on U.S. soil"},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"regardless of the legal\nstatus of their parents."},"839":{"dur":1,"text":"This has been true for a very long time."},"840":{"dur":1,"text":"It's also true in Canada,"},"842":{"dur":1,"text":"but there are many other countries,"},"843":{"dur":2,"text":"New Zealand, Australia, France, Britain"},"846":{"dur":1,"text":"that have, kind of, actually revised"},"847":{"dur":1,"text":"their policies on this
