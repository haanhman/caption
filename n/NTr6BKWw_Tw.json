out"},"3342":{"dur":2,"text":"of the Snowden revelations was that"},"3345":{"dur":2,"text":"other people realized that their internet traffic"},"3348":{"dur":2,"text":"was running through the United

Europe"},"3396":{"dur":2,"text":"rather than in the United States,"},"3399":{"dur":3,"text":"I tried to explain to them that for NSA to search"},"3402":{"dur":4,"text":"a data farm in the United

Europe,"},"3415":{"dur":1,"text":"(audience laughs)"},"3416":{"dur":2,"text":"if that makes you feel better."},"3419":{"dur":3,"text":"But I think what we have seen because"},"3422":{"dur":2,"text":"of the Snowden revelations is that"},"3424":{"dur":3,"text":"a lot of non-American IT companies are using"},"3430":{"dur":4,"text":"the Snowden revelations to say,

you."},"3507":{"dur":2,"text":"You mentioned briefly about how"},"3511":{"dur":1,"text":"the government doesn't really have a policy"},"3513":{"dur":1,"text":"with regards to

them."},"3522":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'm curious to hear what you think"},"3524":{"dur":4,"text":"would be a good sort of policy for responding to that"},"3528":{"dur":2,"text":"because it seems like

targeted."},"3538":{"dur":2,"text":"So what do you think is a good sort of middle ground there"},"3541":{"dur":2,"text":"to also still maintain protection of"},"3543":{"dur":1,"text":"the United

few key manufacturers, perhaps,"},"3595":{"dur":1,"text":"particularly in the defense sector."},"3597":{"dur":3,"text":"It's not impossible for the US government"},"3600":{"dur":4,"text":"to monitor

information are leaving Culver City"},"3619":{"dur":2,"text":"to go to China or North Korea."},"3623":{"dur":1,"text":"In fact, I think the United States government probably"},"3624":{"dur":2,"text":"already does notice when those sorts of things happen."},"3627":{"dur":1,"text":"What it doesn't have is the legal authority"},"3629":{"dur":2,"text":"to do anything about it."},"3631":{"dur":2,"text":"And given the paranoia about NSA,"},"3635":{"dur":4,"text":"some of which is justified, there's a reluctance"},"3639":{"dur":4,"text":"in Washington to say, well, we can do something for you,"},"3645":{"dur":4,"text":"because the somebody who would be doing it would be NSA."},"3650":{"dur":3,"text":"So, we need an open and frank dialogue

laughs)"},"4094":{"dur":3,"text":"So I did that and all of these professors"},"4098":{"dur":2,"text":"who were experts in quantum computing"},"4100":{"dur":3,"text":"and quantum encryption came down
