the cosmic rays."},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"But around the middle of the 20th Century, it"},"602":{"dur":1,"text":"was realised that if you wanted to study these"},"603":{"dur":3,"text":"particles

come from."},"902":{"dur":4,"text":"So let me just discuss this issue in a little"},"906":{"dur":2,"text":"bit more detail."},"909":{"dur":3,"text":"So there are particles that carry the

there\u2019s a theory of that, which is modelled"},"970":{"dur":3,"text":"after Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism."},"974":{"dur":1,"text":"It predicted a whole bunch of
