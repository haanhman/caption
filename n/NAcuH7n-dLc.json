through the workshop."},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"We were then off\ninto the application process."},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"So, we were matched up\nwith a social worker,"},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"she was absolutely fantastic,"},"460":{"dur":5,"text":"and she quite rightly grilled us\non every single question in that form."},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"We were given homework to

provide\nwhat's called \"therapeutic parenting.\""},"477":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, there was one question in that form"},"480":{"dur":3,"text":"that we didn't spend hours\nsoul-searching about,"},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"and that question was:"},"486":{"dur":3,"text":"\"If you have a child\nwho then turns out to be gay,"},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"how would you feel?\""},"491":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"492":{"dur":4,"text":"And we were able to say,\n\"I think we'll be fine.\""},"496":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"And the social

to the approval panel."},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"Again, we were asked\na great number of questions,"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"but one of those questions was:"},"515":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Boys, especially, need dads."},"517":{"dur":5,"text":"If you have a boy, how are you going\nto provide the support that dads do?\""},"523":{"dur":3,"text":"And again, this is a very good question,\nand this is an important question,"},"527":{"dur":4,"text":"but this is one that involves\nassumptions about gender roles."},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"So, my answer was kind of in two parts."},"535":{"dur":1,"text":"Firstly, I said to them,"},"536":{"dur":5,"text":"\"Well, it depends on what you mean\nwhen you say 'what dads do.'"},"542":{"dur":4,"text":"If you mean who will take a child\ndown a park on a Saturday afternoon"},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"and kick a ball around;"},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"who will fix a puncture on a bicycle;"},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"who will tinker with a computer,"},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"my answer to that is, we will."},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"We will do those things.\nEmma and I do those things."},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"Women can do dad things.\""},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you."},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"(Applause)"},"571":{"dur":5,"text":"And that is in exactly the same way\nthat men can do mom things."},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"(Applause)"},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"Over the years,"},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"Emma and I have been quad-biking,"},"589":{"dur":3,"text":"we've been parascending,\nwe've been to tank museums."},"593":{"dur":5,"text":"This time last year, I was with Steven\nand thousands of other teenage boys"},"598":{"dur":3,"text":"and an awful lot of grown men,"},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"far too many of which \nwere dressed as \"Thor,\""},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"at the Gamer Expo in London."},"608":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, this is a \"dad thing\"\nthat I get to do,"},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"and I had a fantastic day."},"615":{"dur":5,"text":"But what we can't do, and what\nwe don't pretend to be able to do,"},"620":{"dur":3,"text":"is to provide a male \nperspective on things:"},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"on shaving, on having your voice break,"},"627":{"dur":4,"text":"on what it's like to actually\ncommunicate with other men"},"631":{"dur":1,"text":"when women aren't around."},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"But in those situations,"},"636":{"dur":5,"text":"we call upon the fantastic circle of men\nthat we have in our friends and family."},"643":{"dur":5,"text":"Steven has lovely granddads,\nhe has amazing uncles, cousins."},"648":{"dur":5,"text":"We rope in the husbands of our friends\nand we rope in our own male friends,"},"653":{"dur":6,"text":"and they advise us on what we might do\nand they also spend time with Steven."},"661":{"dur":4,"text":"So, we got through the approval panel,\nthat was a great day."},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"It was only at that point\nthat we were then told"},"667":{"dur":3,"text":"that we were the first gay couple\nto have gone through that."},"671":{"dur":1,"text":"So that was fantastic."},"673":{"dur":4,"text":"So, off we skipped\ninto the next stage, very excitedly,"},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"which is the matching process."},"680":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, you call local authorities\nup and down the country"},"684":{"dur":4,"text":"to inquire about the children\nthat are in their care systems,"},"689":{"dur":4,"text":"and this is where we hit\na huge wall of negativity."},"693":{"dur":3,"text":"We had lots of awkward silences."},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"We had lots of people who said,"},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"\"I'm sorry. We believe\nthat child needs a dad,\""},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"but with no discussion at all\nabout what that actually meant."},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"We had lots of people\nwho actually just said to us,"},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"\"We believe what you're doing is wrong.\""},"710":{"dur":4,"text":"And that was the worst part\nfor us in the process."},"714":{"dur":4,"text":"It was incredibly battering,\nand we really weren't sure"},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"that we were ever going to get\nmatched, or get through."},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"We thought we might just have to give up."},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, we got a phone call"},"727":{"dur":4,"text":"after we had inquired\nabout a five-year-old boy,"},"731":{"dur":5,"text":"and after many more meetings\nand another panel, a matching panel,"},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"we were matched with Steven."},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"He was nearly six."},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"He's now 16."},"745":{"dur":4,"text":"And that part of the process for us\nwas made a lot easier"},"750":{"dur":4,"text":"because of Steven's foster family\nbeing so supportive."},"755":{"dur":6,"text":"They prepared Steven by saying to him\nthat he was such a special little boy"},"761":{"dur":5,"text":"he was not just going to get one mom,\nhe was going to get two."},"767":{"dur":1,"text":"And that was amazing."},"768":{"dur":4,"text":"It was amazing for us,\nbut it was incredibly positive for Steven,"},"773":{"dur":3,"text":"at that very difficult time\nwhen you're transitioning."},"781":{"dur":4,"text":"And I was talking to Steven's\nfoster family this summer,"},"785":{"dur":1,"text":"and of course they said, \"Yes,"},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"but it's created a little bit\nof a throwback potentially,"},"790":{"dur":3,"text":"because now we have other foster children\nwho kind of stand there going,"},"793":{"dur":4,"text":"'Well, I am super special too,\nand I think I want two moms.'\""},"798":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"800":{"dur":3,"text":"But Steven doesn't just have two moms."},"804":{"dur":4,"text":"Steven has a birth family,\nand we have contact with them."},"808":{"dur":4,"text":"Steven has a foster family,\nand they have become great friends."},"813":{"dur":5,"text":"And Steven has an adoptive family,\nand that isn't just Emma and myself;"},"818":{"dur":5,"text":"it is all of my wider family\nand it is all of Emma's wider family."},"824":{"dur":5,"text":"So, 12 years on from that first workshop,\nhow are we all doing?"},"829":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, Steven spends an awful lot of time\nin his bedroom, on his own."},"835":{"dur":3,"text":"He spends a lot of time on Facebook."},"838":{"dur":3,"text":"It's been like his phone\nhas kind of melded to his hand."},"841":{"dur":3,"text":"He spends an awful lot of time\nin front of the bathroom mirror."},"845":{"dur":2,"text":"He thinks we're totally embarrassing."},"847":{"dur":2,"text":"He doesn't really want\nto be seen out with us in public."},"850":{"dur":2,"text":"He believes our mission\nin life is to nag him"},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"and to stop him from doing\neverything he really wants to."},"855":{"dur":4,"text":"So, we kind of feel that really\nwe've raised a pretty normal teenage boy."},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"(Laughter)"},"862":{"dur":4,"text":"But more seriously,\nSteven is doing brilliantly."},"866":{"dur":3,"text":"Despite his very difficult start in life,"},"870":{"dur":4,"text":"he has always been very intelligent,\nhe has always been very funny."},"874":{"dur":2,"text":"He loves computers.\nHe's a great photographer."},"877":{"dur":2,"text":"He's very creative."},"879":{"dur":3,"text":"We are incredibly proud\nof everything he achieves,"},"883":{"dur":2,"text":"and he is an amazing young man."},"886":{"dur":3,"text":"But he struggles to deal\nwith the consequences"},"890":{"dur":4,"text":"of those very difficult early years,\nand he always will."},"894":{"dur":3,"text":"They are a very\nsignificant part of who he is,"},"899":{"dur":5,"text":"they shape his sense of self\nand they shape his sense of his future,"},"904":{"dur":2,"text":"particularly so during adolescence."},"909":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, what about Emma and I?\nHow are we doing?"},"911":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, just because we might\nhave a bit more empathy"},"915":{"dur":2,"text":"and we might have a bit more flexibility,"},"917":{"dur":2,"text":"that does not make us perfect parents."},"920":{"dur":3,"text":"In exactly the same way\nas other parents do, we struggle."},"924":{"dur":2,"text":"There are some days\nwhere we get it broadly right,"},"926":{"dur":2,"text":"there are some days\nwhere we mess it up completely,"},"929":{"dur":4,"text":"but we love Steven\nand we tell him that every single day,"},"934":{"dur":3,"text":"again, much to his annoyance\nand embarrassment, really."},"938":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"939":{"dur":3,"text":"So, is there a moral to this tale?\nWell, yes, there is."},"944":{"dur":1,"text":"We should not assume"},"945":{"dur":5,"text":"that families are a certain number\nor a certain gender of people."},"951":{"dur":6,"text":"Families come in all shapes and sizes.\nThey always have, and they always will."},"958":{"dur":2,"text":"And gay adopters, gay parents,"},"961":{"dur":4,"text":"we are just actually\none very small part of that mix."},"965":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's OK. It really is."},"969":{"dur":4,"text":"We are not as different\nand we are certainly not as threatening"},"974":{"dur":3,"text":"as the media headlines\nmight have people believe."},"977":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you."},"978":{"dur":2,"text":"(Applause)"}}
