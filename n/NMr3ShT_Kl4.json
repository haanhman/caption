{"15":{"dur":3,"text":"What I want to talk about today is one idea."},"18":{"dur":2,"text":"It's an idea for a new kind of school,"},"20":{"dur":3,"text":"which turns on its head much of our conventional thinking"},"23":{"dur":2,"text":"about what schools are for and how they work."},"25":{"dur":3,"text":"And it might just be coming to a neighborhood near you soon."},"28":{"dur":2,"text":"Where it comes from"},"30":{"dur":2,"text":"is an organization called the Young Foundation,"},"32":{"dur":2,"text":"which, over many decades,"},"34":{"dur":3,"text":"has come up with many innovations in education, like the Open University"},"37":{"dur":2,"text":"and things like Extended Schools,"},"39":{"dur":3,"text":"Schools for Social Entrepreneurs, Summer Universities"},"42":{"dur":2,"text":"and the School of Everything."},"44":{"dur":2,"text":"And about five years ago, we asked"},"46":{"dur":2,"text":"what was the most important need for innovation"},"48":{"dur":3,"text":"in schooling here in the U.K."},"51":{"dur":2,"text":"And we felt the most important priority"},"53":{"dur":2,"text":"was to bring together two sets of problems."},"55":{"dur":2,"text":"One was large numbers of bored teenagers"},"57":{"dur":2,"text":"who just didn't like school,"},"59":{"dur":2,"text":"couldn't see any relationship between what they learned in school"},"61":{"dur":2,"text":"and future jobs."},"63":{"dur":2,"text":"And employers who kept complaining"},"65":{"dur":3,"text":"that the kids coming out of school weren't actually ready for real work,"},"68":{"dur":2,"text":"didn't have the right attitudes and experience."},"70":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we try to ask:"},"72":{"dur":2,"text":"What kind of school would have the teenagers fighting to get in,"},"74":{"dur":3,"text":"not fighting to stay out?"},"77":{"dur":2,"text":"And after hundreds of conversations"},"79":{"dur":2,"text":"with teenagers and teachers and parents"},"81":{"dur":2,"text":"and employers and schools"},"83":{"dur":2,"text":"from Paraguay to Australia,"},"85":{"dur":2,"text":"and looking at some of the academic research,"},"87":{"dur":2,"text":"which showed the importance"},"89":{"dur":2,"text":"of what's now called non-cognitive skills --"},"91":{"dur":3,"text":"the skills of motivation, resilience --"},"94":{"dur":2,"text":"and that these are as important"},"96":{"dur":2,"text":"as the cognitive skills -- formal academic skills --"},"98":{"dur":3,"text":"we came up with an answer, a very simple answer in a way,"},"101":{"dur":2,"text":"which we called the Studio School."},"103":{"dur":2,"text":"And we called it a studio school"},"105":{"dur":4,"text":"to go back to the original idea of a studio in the Renaissance"},"109":{"dur":2,"text":"where work and learning are integrated."},"111":{"dur":2,"text":"You work by learning,"},"113":{"dur":2,"text":"and you learn by working."},"115":{"dur":3,"text":"And the design we came up with had the following characteristics."},"118":{"dur":2,"text":"First of all, we wanted small schools --"},"120":{"dur":2,"text":"about 300, 400 pupils --"},"122":{"dur":2,"text":"14 to 19 year-olds,"},"124":{"dur":3,"text":"and critically, about 80 percent of the curriculum done"},"127":{"dur":2,"text":"not through sitting in classrooms,"},"129":{"dur":2,"text":"but through real-life, practical projects,"},"131":{"dur":2,"text":"working on commission"},"133":{"dur":2,"text":"to businesses, NGO's and others."},"135":{"dur":3,"text":"That every pupil would have a coach, as well as teachers,"},"138":{"dur":2,"text":"who would have timetables"},"140":{"dur":2,"text":"much more like a work environment in a business."},"142":{"dur":2,"text":"And all of this will be done within the public system,"},"144":{"dur":2,"text":"funded by public money,"},"146":{"dur":2,"text":"but independently run."},"148":{"dur":3,"text":"And all at no extra cost, no selection,"},"151":{"dur":3,"text":"and allowing the pupils the route into university,"},"154":{"dur":3,"text":"even if many of them would want to become entrepreneurs"},"157":{"dur":2,"text":"and have manual jobs as well."},"159":{"dur":3,"text":"Underlying it was some very simple ideas"},"162":{"dur":3,"text":"that large numbers of teenagers learn best by doing things,"},"165":{"dur":2,"text":"they learn best in teams"},"167":{"dur":3,"text":"and they learn best by doing things for real --"},"170":{"dur":2,"text":"all the opposite of what mainstream schooling"},"172":{"dur":2,"text":"actually does."},"174":{"dur":2,"text":"Now that was a nice idea,"},"176":{"dur":3,"text":"so we moved into the rapid prototyping phase."},"179":{"dur":2,"text":"We tried it out,"},"181":{"dur":2,"text":"first in Luton --"},"183":{"dur":2,"text":"famous for its airport and not much else, I fear --"},"185":{"dur":3,"text":"and in Blackpool -- famous for its beaches and leisure."},"188":{"dur":2,"text":"And what we found -- and we got quite a lot of things wrong"},"190":{"dur":2,"text":"and then improved them --"},"192":{"dur":2,"text":"but we found that the young people loved it."},"194":{"dur":3,"text":"They found it much more motivational, much more exciting"},"197":{"dur":2,"text":"than traditional education."},"199":{"dur":2,"text":"And perhaps most important of all,"},"201":{"dur":3,"text":"two years later when the exam results came through,"},"204":{"dur":2,"text":"the pupils who had been put on these field trials"},"206":{"dur":2,"text":"who were in the lowest performing groups"},"208":{"dur":2,"text":"had jumped right to the top --"},"210":{"dur":3,"text":"in fact, pretty much at the top decile of performance"},"213":{"dur":2,"text":"in terms of GCSE's,"},"215":{"dur":3,"text":"which is the British marking system."},"218":{"dur":2,"text":"Now not surprisingly,"},"220":{"dur":3,"text":"that influenced some people to think we were onto something."},"223":{"dur":2,"text":"The minister of education"},"225":{"dur":2,"text":"down south in London"},"227":{"dur":2,"text":"described himself as a \"big fan.\""},"229":{"dur":3,"text":"And the business organizations thought we were onto something"},"232":{"dur":2,"text":"in terms of a way of preparing children much better"},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"for real-life work today."},"236":{"dur":2,"text":"And indeed, the head of the Chambers of Commerce"},"238":{"dur":3,"text":"is now the chairman of the Studio Schools Trust"},"241":{"dur":3,"text":"and helping it, not just with big businesses,"},"244":{"dur":3,"text":"but small businesses all over the country."},"247":{"dur":2,"text":"We started with two schools."},"249":{"dur":2,"text":"That's grown this year to about 10."},"251":{"dur":3,"text":"And next year, we're expecting about 35 schools"},"254":{"dur":2,"text":"open across England,"},"256":{"dur":2,"text":"and another 40 areas"},"258":{"dur":2,"text":"want to have their own schools opening --"},"260":{"dur":2,"text":"a pretty rapid spread"},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"of this idea."},"264":{"dur":2,"text":"Interestingly,"},"266":{"dur":3,"text":"it's happened almost entirely without media coverage."},"269":{"dur":4,"text":"It's happened almost entirely without big money behind it."},"273":{"dur":4,"text":"It spread almost entirely through word of mouth, virally,"},"277":{"dur":2,"text":"across teachers, parents,"},"279":{"dur":2,"text":"people involved in education."},"281":{"dur":2,"text":"And it spread because of the power of an idea --"},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"so the very, very simple idea"},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"about turning education on its head"},"287":{"dur":3,"text":"and putting the things which were marginal,"},"290":{"dur":3,"text":"things like working in teams, doing practical projects,"},"293":{"dur":3,"text":"and putting them right at the heart of learning,"},"296":{"dur":3,"text":"rather than on the edges."},"299":{"dur":2,"text":"Now there's a whole set of new schools"},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"opening up this autumn."},"303":{"dur":2,"text":"This is one from Yorkshire"},"305":{"dur":3,"text":"where, in fact, my nephew, I hope, will be able to attend it."},"308":{"dur":2,"text":"And this one is focused"},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"on creative and media industries."},"312":{"dur":2,"text":"Other ones have a focus on health care,"},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"tourism, engineering"},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"and other fields."},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"We think we're onto something."},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not perfect yet,"},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"but we think this is one idea"},"324":{"dur":2,"text":"which can transform the lives"},"326":{"dur":2,"text":"of thousands, possibly millions, of teenagers"},"328":{"dur":2,"text":"who are really bored by schooling."},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"It doesn't animate them."},"332":{"dur":3,"text":"They're not like all of you who can sit in rows"},"335":{"dur":3,"text":"and hear things said to you for hour after hour."},"338":{"dur":3,"text":"They want to do things, they want to get their hands dirty,"},"341":{"dur":3,"text":"they want education to be for real."},"344":{"dur":2,"text":"And my hope is that some of you out there"},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"may be able to help us."},"348":{"dur":3,"text":"We feel we're on the beginning of a journey"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"of experiment and improvement"},"353":{"dur":2,"text":"to turn the Studio School idea"},"355":{"dur":3,"text":"into something which is present,"},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"not as a universal answer for every child,"},"360":{"dur":3,"text":"but at least as an answer for some children in every part of the world."},"363":{"dur":3,"text":"And I hope that a few of you at least can help us make that happen."},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"Thank you very much."},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"(Applause)"}}
