And so, of course, with this renewed"},"210":{"dur":3,"text":"sense of purpose, I went out into the developing\nworld. We got shipwrecked, and then we continued"},"214":{"dur":4,"text":"to travel.

But they really, really\ngot how communities worked. They usually lived"},"333":{"dur":4,"text":"there.

I was kind of on this finance"},"350":{"dur":5,"text":"path, but now I was this guy obsessed with\nbackpacking and going to now more than 70"},"355":{"dur":5,"text":"countries just backpacking. So I figured why\nnot try to become a hybrid of the two? So"},"361":{"dur":3,"text":"I went through interviews with investment\nbanks and management consulting firms and"},"365":{"dur":4,"text":"private equity and was really fortunate to\nland a job at Bain & Company.

I decided to start a nonprofit\nthat was driven by for-profit business principles"},"389":{"dur":4,"text":"with kind of this nonprofit set of ideals.\nAnd so I really believe this: Big dreams start"},"393":{"dur":4,"text":"with small and reasonable acts. I was about\nto turn 25. I was 24. I went to the bank."},"397":{"dur":3,"text":"And I said, \"I want to start this organization\ncalled Pencils of Promise and I want to try"},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"to build one school. What do I have to start\nwith?\""},"403":{"dur":4,"text":"They said, \"Well, $25.\"\nI said, \"That's a good sign. I'm about to"},"408":{"dur":5,"text":"turn 25.\" So I put $25 into a bank account.\nThis is the actual deposit. And asked my friends"},"413":{"dur":4,"text":"to come to the birthday party. I was in Mark\nZuckerberg's year in college. I was at Brown"},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"in the sophomore class when he launched it\nas a sophomore at Harvard.

It was the\nway we conversed with one another. I sent"},"430":{"dur":4,"text":"out a Facebook invite. I said give $20 at\nthe door. Every dollar is going to Pencils"},"434":{"dur":5,"text":"of Promise. We, basically, found any excuse\nto throw a small event for young professionals"},"440":{"dur":5,"text":"in New York City. And, in our first two years,\n98% of the donations that we received were"},"445":{"dur":5,"text":"in amounts of $100 or less from young people.\nThis is a very, very atraditional approach"},"451":{"dur":4,"text":"to starting a nonprofit. And every person\nsaid to me. \"It's impossible. Can't be done."},"455":{"dur":4,"text":"Completely impossible.

So this is the Bain office at 10:00\np.m. These are people -- I won't go through"},"468":{"dur":5,"text":"their backgrounds, but this is the top pedigree\nacross New York City. And we formed this a"},"474":{"dur":4,"text":"model of how we were going to do work. We\nbuilt it on management consultant principles"},"478":{"dur":6,"text":"of community evaluation, monitoring, and data\ntracking, really. And not just having kind"},"485":{"dur":5,"text":"of this compassion, but backing it up with\na sense of true sustainability. And so, you"},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"know, then we sent people into the field.\nAnd we took these beautiful pictures. And"},"494":{"dur":4,"text":"we GPS located everything. And we proposed\nsomething that was foreign to the space. And"},"499":{"dur":4,"text":"we said we propose radical transparency.

So kind of what's happened? One, we've"},"535":{"dur":4,"text":"broken ground on more than 40 schools across\nLaos, Nicaragua, and Guatemala. And, two,"},"539":{"dur":3,"text":"we've built up the largest social media following\nout of any nonprofit startup in the last four"},"543":{"dur":4,"text":"years.

There's"},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"a few things I can share with this audience\nin terms of the spirit of the times. It's"},"562":{"dur":5,"text":"the way we approach the work. We're not a\nnonprofit, at all. That's an oxymoron of a"},"568":{"dur":4,"text":"term. We're a \"for purpose.\" We want to make\nmassive profits, but we're more driven by"},"572":{"dur":6,"text":"our purpose than our profits. I really believe\nin this notion that there's change coming."},"579":{"dur":5,"text":"There is this angry, angry for-profit space\nand this doe-eyed kind of for-purpose space."},"584":{"dur":4,"text":"But there's this emerging change that's happening\nwhere the for-profits are actually creating"},"588":{"dur":4,"text":"a lot of good through cause marketing and\ndifferent initiatives, CSR, et cetera. What"},"593":{"dur":3,"text":"I think is coming is the for-purpose space\nis, actually, going to start treating itself"},"596":{"dur":7,"text":"more like the for-profit space and the intersection\nI call \"profitable purpose.\" Okay? This is"},"603":{"dur":4,"text":"a new term I'm, hopefully, going to start\nproject without there. That's what I think"},"607":{"dur":3,"text":"is the future.\nHow does that happen? Five kind of really,"},"611":{"dur":7,"text":"really simple steps but, again, somewhat atraditional.\nOne, you find your revolution. I was really"},"618":{"dur":3,"text":"inspired by the Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan\nand all these other individuals, who they"},"622":{"dur":4,"text":"created a revolution within people. But it\nstarted within themselves. And I really believe"},"627":{"dur":4,"text":"this. Every person is a revolution within\nthemselves waiting to happen. Okay? So find"},"631":{"dur":3,"text":"your revolution. You find what you love most.\nThat's the first step."},"634":{"dur":4,"text":"Second, you speak the language of the person\nyou want to become. If you run a company and"},"638":{"dur":4,"text":"you have an interest in actually using your\ncompany to build true, true social change,"},"643":{"dur":5,"text":"you just speak it. And then the universal\nenergy of the world conspires to make it happen."},"648":{"dur":5,"text":"Third, you embrace the late sleepless nights.\nThis stuff doesn't happen easily."},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"People say, \"How did you build up hundreds\nof thousands of followers?\""},"655":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, I spent a lot of time in front of a\ncomputer. That's how it happened. I mean,"},"660":{"dur":6,"text":"we really -- we spend our time in the middle\nof the night dreaming up concepts that I think"},"666":{"dur":3,"text":"only occur in this kind of weird state of\nliminality when the rest of the world is at"},"670":{"dur":4,"text":"rest and we're still dreaming but kind of\ndoing it while we're awake."},"674":{"dur":5,"text":"Fourth is, you seek out the impossible ones.\nI'm not a realist. I see no point in being"},"680":{"dur":5,"text":"a realist and a pragmatist. I think of myself\nnot even as an idealist. I'm an impossiblist."},"685":{"dur":5,"text":"I believe in things that are utterly impossible.\nWe built 40 schools in three years. We now"},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"really believe that we can build more than\n100 by the end of next year.
