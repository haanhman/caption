The first thing I\nwanted to say to you is like me and my cabinet"},"627":{"dur":5,"text":"colleagues I've actually run a small business.\nI've also been in a big business, I've also"},"632":{"dur":5,"text":"been in the public service, I've also been\nin the military. So I can say to you having"},"637":{"dur":4,"text":"run a small business for two years, I really\nabsolutely get it and what's involved. And"},"642":{"dur":6,"text":"I've employed people and I know the challenges,\nthe responsibilities, but also the great sense"},"648":{"dur":4,"text":"of personal satisfaction when you do your\nown thing.

So\nI really have to race through this. The first"},"662":{"dur":6,"text":"thing I wanted to say is that we have a vision\nfor this State now that I think is incredibly"},"668":{"dur":4,"text":"exciting. It's not the government's vision,\nit's the vision of 80,000 Queenslanders who"},"673":{"dur":8,"text":"had their say over the last 18 months to create\nthe Queensland Plan. Unlike any other State,"},"681":{"dur":7,"text":"unlike the Commonwealth Government this State\nhas a 30 year plan with goals and targets"},"689":{"dur":6,"text":"that very clearly sets out where we've got\nto go and defines the Queensland that we want"},"696":{"dur":5,"text":"in the years to come. That's very powerful.\nNow there are all range of things in there,"},"701":{"dur":4,"text":"it talks about education, it talks about health,\nit talks about building up the regions, in"},"706":{"dur":6,"text":"fact it says that Queenslanders want to see\nthe population outside south east Queensland"},"712":{"dur":5,"text":"doubled over the next 30 years. That's a bold\nan ambitious target. If you haven't seen the"},"718":{"dur":4,"text":"plan, I really encourage you to get hold of\nit. Download it from the internet, it should"},"723":{"dur":5,"text":"be an invaluable business planning tool for\nyou because it talks about the real agenda."},"728":{"dur":6,"text":"And all of government including local government\nwill be required to have regard to the Queensland"},"735":{"dur":5,"text":"Plan in all the things that we then do. One\nof the aspects of course of the Queensland"},"740":{"dur":5,"text":"Plan is then need for a strong and vibrant\neconomy for jobs to be created. That's always"},"746":{"dur":4,"text":"been my government's agenda anyway. And we\nhave been working over the last two and a"},"751":{"dur":5,"text":"half years relentlessly to supercharge the\nQueensland economy. So ladies and gentlemen"},"756":{"dur":6,"text":"we have been doing everything we can to make\nthis the best place in Australia to do business"},"763":{"dur":7,"text":"because we understand business, we know that\nultimately business takes care of itself if"},"770":{"dur":7,"text":"government gets out of the way. So we've had\na target to reduce red tape by 20 percent."},"778":{"dur":5,"text":"We've been relentlessly going through and\nlooking at reform to get rid of needless red"},"783":{"dur":7,"text":"tape and bureaucracy. We got rid of a waste\ntax, we changed the documentation for real"},"790":{"dur":7,"text":"estate agents selling homes. No longer do\nsmall smash repairers and vehicle servicing"},"798":{"dur":8,"text":"garages have to have an environmental licence,\npay $1,500 and fill out forms each year. We've"},"807":{"dur":5,"text":"changed Worker's Compensation laws. We have\nthe best scheme in Australia now for employees"},"812":{"dur":5,"text":"ladies and gentlemen. It's the only state\nwhere you're covered for journeys to and from"},"817":{"dur":7,"text":"work as an employee. However, on average Worker's\nCompensation premiums have come down by 17"},"825":{"dur":6,"text":"percent for business in the new financial\nyear. There will be a lot more to come. I"},"832":{"dur":4,"text":"say today it's a thought for you for the future\nthrough your representative organisations"},"837":{"dur":5,"text":"you need to let us know what more we, that\nwe can do. So Stephen Tate from CCIQ is here"},"842":{"dur":5,"text":"today for example. He sits in my business\nadvisory forum that meets quarterly and that"},"848":{"dur":6,"text":"is an opportunity always for business to say\nget rid of this, change that, there are roadblocks"},"854":{"dur":4,"text":"there, how come you have that charge or tax,\nwouldn't it be more efficient to do it that"},"858":{"dur":7,"text":"way? I assure you we really want to know this\nstuff and we will continue to undertake reform"},"865":{"dur":5,"text":"that's sensible and makes sense. The exciting\nthing though is where we are going now. If"},"871":{"dur":6,"text":"we go back three years ago this State was\nin second last place in terms of the CommSec"},"877":{"dur":6,"text":"ratings of State's economic performance. We\nwere second only to Tasmania in terms of going"},"883":{"dur":5,"text":"for the wooden spoon, now we're in second\nplace. So we've moved up the ladder. And the"},"889":{"dur":6,"text":"exciting thing is, this financial year we\nwill go into lead place. We will be the lead"},"895":{"dur":5,"text":"State economically. This State is going to\nsee more jobs created, we are already doing"},"901":{"dur":5,"text":"that than any other Australian State each\nmonth as we go forward. This State is going"},"906":{"dur":8,"text":"to see continued growth in construction, in\ntourism, in agriculture and yes in resources."},"914":{"dur":5,"text":"And the small businesses that support all\nthose sectors will continue to prosper. And"},"919":{"dur":5,"text":"of course international student education,\nbiotechnology and IT, the gains industry still"},"925":{"dur":5,"text":"continue I think to grow successfully. Before\nI conclude, I just wanted to talk about one"},"931":{"dur":5,"text":"other thing that is very important to us that\nyou may not have heard of. We believe ladies"},"936":{"dur":6,"text":"and gentlemen in a very important principle\nand the principle is what we call open data."},"943":{"dur":6,"text":"What I'm talking about is this, government\ncollects all sorts of information but it's"},"949":{"dur":5,"text":"never released it in the past. Today you can\ngo to the open data website and there's some,"},"955":{"dur":5,"text":"some 1,400 data sets that we now have put\nout there, information, data that has never"},"961":{"dur":5,"text":"been available before that you can use for\nyour business, all sorts of stuff. Some of"},"966":{"dur":5,"text":"its seemingly useless and superfluous, but\nfor example you can see the location of any"},"972":{"dur":7,"text":"bus stop in the State. You can see where the\nschools are. You can find out what motor vehicles"},"979":{"dur":6,"text":"are registered by various make and model in\nthe suburbs and the cities in towns of Queensland."},"986":{"dur":6,"text":"You can see real time updated every 30 minutes\nwhere every bushfire in Queensland is or every"},"992":{"dur":5,"text":"authorised controlled burn. Now you might\nsay why is he going on about this? Well ladies"},"998":{"dur":8,"text":"and gentlemen data information is gold. That's\nwhy we are also this week launching our open"},"1007":{"dur":7,"text":"data competition so that application developers,\ndata miners, business people can propose great"},"1014":{"dur":5,"text":"ideas about how to use this data for economic\nadvantage. Ladies and gentlemen this is an"},"1020":{"dur":5,"text":"exciting time to live in this State. This\nyear we will become the lead economic State"},"1025":{"dur":6,"text":"and I urge all small businesses to see that,\nrealise that, seize the opportunities and"},"1032":{"dur":4,"text":"take the potential of this State forward.\nYou do employ 38 percent of the workshop,"},"1037":{"dur":6,"text":"workforce across 403,000 businesses. If every\nsmall business employed one or two more people"},"1043":{"dur":5,"text":"just think what we'd see in terms of our jobs\nfigures. Thank you very much for coming today,"},"1049":{"dur":6,"text":"again I am looking forward with keen anticipation\nto Professor Lerner's speech. It's great to"},"1055":{"dur":4,"text":"have you here Josh.
