the course\nof understanding"},"232":{"dur":2,"text":"the basics of\nattention, we've also"},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"come to understand that\nthere are some things that"},"236":{"dur":3,"text":"are

is working well"},"260":{"dur":1,"text":"because we'll lean on it."},"262":{"dur":3,"text":"And after understanding\nthis for several years,"},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"it became sort of a\ncompelling

compromised,"},"274":{"dur":2,"text":"how might we train the\nbrain's attention system"},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"to be protected against this?"},"278":{"dur":2,"text":"Because it's unlikely for\nthe

wish we could, but sorry."},"295":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's where\nmindfulness training"},"296":{"dur":1,"text":"comes into my lab's work."},"298":{"dur":2,"text":"And what I'll share with you\nis the studies that we've"},"301":{"dur":4,"text":"been up to, but also the state\nof the field of this research."},"305":{"dur":2,"text":"And of course, because\nscience is a team

strange\nlooks like, why are you asking"},"382":{"dur":1,"text":"such a ridiculous question?"},"383":{"dur":1,"text":"And what I want\nto suggest to you"},"385":{"dur":1,"text":"is the reason we get\non exercise bikes"},"387":{"dur":4,"text":"or we go for jogs is because we\nhave a cultural understanding"},"391":{"dur":3,"text":"that this is true, that we need\nto exercise our bodies to

ask."},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"But what I want to suggest to\nyou-- and actually, argue--"},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"is that this understanding\ndidn't come out of thin air."},"405":{"dur":4,"text":"It actually came through a\ndedicated set of research"},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"questions and science\nthat pursued understanding"},"411":{"dur":2,"text":"the relationship with\nregard to physical health"},"414":{"dur":1,"text":"and physical exercise."},"415":{"dur":4,"text":"And one of the key, really,\npioneers in this area"},"419":{"dur":4,"text":"was actually an Air Force\ncaptain, who

aerobic exercise\ncomes from his work."},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"And of course, many, many other\nresearch studies followed."},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"And the way in which\nthis field of research"},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"has parsed the question\nof physical health"},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"and physical exercise\nis as follows, right?"},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"We know that we can\nlook at the physiology."},"457":{"dur":1,"text":"We can actually\nconduct research that"},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"has people exercising and look\nat their oxygen consumption,"},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"or whatever it is."},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"Carbon dioxide levels\nin the blood, et cetera."},"469":{"dur":3,"text":"And that gives us an\nindication of their health."},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"So while they're actually\nperforming the act of exercise,"},"474":{"dur":0,"text":"we can look at them."},"475":{"dur":1,"text":"We can look at\npeople that choose"},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"as a lifestyle to engage in\nphysical activity-- elite"},"479":{"dur":0,"text":"athletes."},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"And we can see what their\nphysiology looks like at rest,"},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"to see if it differs

actually"},"505":{"dur":1,"text":"engage in activity in\nterms of how well they"},"507":{"dur":3,"text":"perform a challenge task, for\nexample, of running a marathon."},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"So this

that"},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"have been done on this topic."},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"And that volume of\nresearch is what I would"},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"say is why we have the

make that point."},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"It seems trivial, but it\ndidn't come out of nowhere."},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"And that now because\nof this research,"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"we are at a

optimize."},"553":{"dur":1,"text":"All right."},"554":{"dur":1,"text":"So I think I've made that point."},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"And I want to switch gears to\na different kind of a question."},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"Does mental exercise improve\npsychological well-being?"},"562":{"dur":1,"text":"How many people would say yes?"},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"Raise your hand."},"565":{"dur":0,"text":"All right, fine."},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"It's unanimous in the room."},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"But I always like to\nthink-- you didn't wander"},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"in here accidentally, right?"},"572":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think I was talking\nto a warmer crowd anyway."},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"But if I actually\nprobed you right now"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"and said exactly\nwhat you should do,"},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"I bet the diversity of\nopinion would be quite high."},"582":{"dur":1,"text":"And part of the reason\nis because we're not"},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"at the same level as we are\nwith regard to an evidence"},"586":{"dur":3,"text":"base regarding what\nyou should do in order"},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"to stay psychologically fit."},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"And what mental\nexercises you should do."},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's sort of\nthe project of what"},"596":{"dur":3,"text":"we're talking about with regard\nto the science of mindfulness."},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"It's really to\nsystematically and rigorously"},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"be able to ask this question to\nsee what role it has to

National\nInstitutes of Health"},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"is very interested in\nunderstanding the answer"},"613":{"dur":0,"text":"to this question."},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"And what they've\ndone now is surveyed"},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"a broad group of US society."},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"And what they found is\nthat many people engage--"},"622":{"dur":3,"text":"willingly, on their own, engage\nin certain mind-body practices"},"625":{"dur":1,"text":"to benefit their\npsychological well-being."},"627":{"dur":3,"text":"And meditation, of which this\nterm mindfulness

what\nis driving people to do this?"},"641":{"dur":3,"text":"What is their\nnumber 1 explanation"},"644":{"dur":5,"text":"for what motivates them\nto practice meditation?"},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, it's this."},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"And I mean, I don't really\nlike showing this slide."},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"I think it's kind of stressful."},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"But it does really\nsuggest to us that there's"},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"a motivating factor\nthat most of us--"},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"the bottom-line denominator\nof what all of us"},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"experience in our lives that\nmake us wanting to do something"},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"to help ourselves."},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"And when I give this\ntype of presentation"},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"and I say stress, especially\nto military audiences,"},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"I usually get\nimmediate push-back,"},"677":{"dur":1,"text":"like what are you talking about?"},"678":{"dur":3,"text":"Stress allows me to\nrise to the challenge."},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm at my peak because\nthere's something driving

it."},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"And my answer to\nthat is absolutely."},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"So I want to describe\nto you a very well, kind"},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"of explored function\nthat describes"},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"what a lot of these service\nmembers are saying to me,"},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"which is the Yerkes-Dodson law."},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"It may be familiar\nto some of you."},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"And what it's\nsaying, essentially,"},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"is that there is a lawful\nrelationship between the amount"},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"of stress or challenge\nwe experience,"},"712":{"dur":1,"text":"the amount of demand\nwe experience,"},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"which is shown on the\nx-axis, and our performance"},"716":{"dur":1,"text":"on the y-axis."},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"What it suggests is that,\nsure, when our stress is low,"},"721":{"dur":4,"text":"when we have nothing\ndriving us, our performance"},"725":{"dur":1,"text":"isn't that great--"},"726":{"dur":3,"text":"back down at the\nbottom near the origin."},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"But as our stress\nincreases, we do actually"},"733":{"dur":1,"text":"rise to the challenge."},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"Our performance does\nincrease until we"},"737":{"dur":3,"text":"reach that sweet spot, what\nwe might call \"optimum stress,"},"740":{"dur":1,"text":"optimal stress.\""},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"And everything on sort of\nthis side of that sweet spot,"},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"we'd call eustress,\nor good stress."},"747":{"dur":3,"text":"But when we

stress."},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"At that point, the\ncurve starts going down."},"761":{"dur":3,"text":"And what we learn is that\nperformance actually declines."},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"And we would no longer call\nthat beneficial stress."},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"We'd call it distress."},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is what unfortunately\nhappens to many of us,"},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"even if something\nstarted out as eustress"},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"because it was the right amount\nof challenge and motivation,"},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"if you have to experience\nthat amount of

psychological distress."},"788":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's what I'm\ntalking about right now."},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm talking about\nthis notion that there"},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"are levels of demand,\nsituational challenges,"},"795":{"dur":3,"text":"psychological challenges,\neven physical challenges, that"},"798":{"dur":4,"text":"put us at not allowing\noptimal functioning."},"803":{"dur":1,"text":"And of course, then\nan obvious question"},"804":{"dur":1,"text":"might be, what can\nwe do about it?"},"806":{"dur":1,"text":"And as I mentioned,\nthere are populations"},"807":{"dur":1,"text":"of people for whom\nthey don't have"},"809":{"dur":1,"text":"much of a choice in\nthe level of demand"},"811":{"dur":1,"text":"that they may

on"},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"is to see if there's\nsomething we can do about it."},"858":{"dur":2,"text":"Is there some way in\nwhich we could actually"},"860":{"dur":2,"text":"explore

part,\nnon-overlapping."},"2715":{"dur":2,"text":"Meaning that they're\ntaxing and activating"},"2717":{"dur":2,"text":"different parts of the brain."},"2719":{"dur":2,"text":"And that

also"},"2753":{"dur":2,"text":"give us great\nhypotheses of where"},"2755":{"dur":1,"text":"we think mindfulness\ntraining may"},"2757":{"dur":2,"text":"have its structural\nand functional

key."},"2786":{"dur":2,"text":"But what's key is\nthat it's not random."},"2789":{"dur":2,"text":"And that some of those\nsame nodes with regard"},"2791":{"dur":3,"text":"to selecting,

practice mindfulness training\nfor, let's say, 5 to 20 years."},"2840":{"dur":1,"text":"So when we see\nchanges like this,"},"2842":{"dur":1,"text":"it could be because\nof the mindfulness,"},"2844":{"dur":2,"text":"but it could be that people that\ndecide to practice mindfulness"},"2846":{"dur":3,"text":"had other dietary choices,\ndifferent social

may--\neven before they ever"},"2855":{"dur":2,"text":"started doing anything\nhaving to do with meditation,"},"2858":{"dur":1,"text":"So what we don't\nknow from studies"},"2860":{"dur":2,"text":"like this is what's driving\nthe nature of the change, which"},"2862":{"dur":2,"text":"means that to actually be\nrigorous in what we do,"},"2865":{"dur":3,"text":"we'd have to assign people to\ndifferent types of practices"},"2868":{"dur":2,"text":"and compare the structure\nand function of their

want to do next."},"2877":{"dur":2,"text":"Or we are doing, I should say."},"2879":{"dur":2,"text":"So just to kind of\ncatch us up to speed,"},"2881":{"dur":2,"text":"you remember this figure\nand

interest isn't so much--"},"2960":{"dur":1,"text":"we want people to get\nbetter, of course."},"2961":{"dur":2,"text":"But we want to see if we\ncan use mindfulness

question about\nthe emotional side."},"3144":{"dur":3,"text":"So have there been\nresearch published"},"3148":{"dur":4,"text":"on the effect of the emotions\nwhile either being mindful"},"3152":{"dur":3,"text":"or in the moment of stress,\nlike how has that been handled?"},"3155":{"dur":4,"text":"Whether it's a flight or fight\nor fear, anger, or anything"},"3160":{"dur":1,"text":"AMISHI JHA: Yeah, absolutely."},"3162":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think that that\nis a very important--"},"3165":{"dur":2,"text":"and it may seem\nunrelated to attention,"},"3167":{"dur":2,"text":"but it's actually\ndeeply intertwined"},"3170":{"dur":3,"text":"with the attentional\nwork that I was sharing."},"3173":{"dur":3,"text":"Because it ends up\nthat these aspects"},"3176":{"dur":5,"text":"of our emotional response to an\nexperience tend to be the thing"},"3181":{"dur":3,"text":"that can hijack our attention\naway from the moment."},"3185":{"dur":1,"text":"So if you're having\na fear response"},"3187":{"dur":3,"text":"or you're having\nanger, that content"},"3190":{"dur":1,"text":"consumes the\nattentional resources"},"3192":{"dur":1,"text":"available in the moment."},"3193":{"dur":3,"text":"So part of what we're seeing\nactually in some of our work"},"3196":{"dur":2,"text":"is that when we increase\nthe capacity of working"},"3199":{"dur":1,"text":"memory and attention,\nwe can actually"},"3201":{"dur":2,"text":"improve emotion regulation."},"3203":{"dur":1,"text":"So for example, in\npre-deployment Marines,"},"3205":{"dur":2,"text":"what we found is that\nif we do nothing at all,"},"3207":{"dur":1,"text":"their negative mood--"},"3208":{"dur":2,"text":"as you can imagine,\ntheir negative mood"},"3210":{"dur":2,"text":"increased in the\neight-week period"},"3213":{"dur":2,"text":"as they approached\npre-deployment."},"3215":{"dur":1,"text":"Got more
