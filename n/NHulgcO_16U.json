a lot of\nstuff hung up on that."},"2856":{"dur":3,"text":"And it could be many reasons."},"2859":{"dur":5,"text":"The first thing I\nhope is that they"},"2864":{"dur":5,"text":"have a peer around

OK."},"2925":{"dur":1,"text":"We're going to figure this out."},"2926":{"dur":2,"text":"The thing that I would\nprobably do in this case,"},"2928":{"dur":1,"text":"from a practical\nstandpoint, it sounds"},"2930":{"dur":2,"text":"like there's good\nresources here at Google,"},"2933":{"dur":2,"text":"in your EAP and other things."},"2935":{"dur":2,"text":"I would look at what\nthose resources

about\nmental health, that"},"2966":{"dur":2,"text":"is something that's going\nto help people like this"},"2969":{"dur":2,"text":"be more willing to get\nthe help that they

we can all do that."},"3038":{"dur":5,"text":"So that's why I'd say, look at\nwhat you've got in your EAP."},"3043":{"dur":1,"text":"The woman who\nspoke earlier I bet"},"3044":{"dur":2,"text":"would
