today."},"19":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'd like you guys to go through an exercise with me"},"22":{"dur":1,"text":"before I begin."},"23":{"dur":1,"text":"Please close your eyes"},"25":{"dur":3,"text":"and hold out your hands in front of you."},"31":{"dur":4,"text":"And imagine what you could place inside your hands."},"35":{"dur":2,"text":"An apple, maybe your keys?"},"39":{"dur":1,"text":"Now open your eyes."},"41":{"dur":1,"text":"What about a life?"},"44":{"dur":1,"text":"What you see here is a premature baby."},"46":{"dur":2,"text":"He looks like he's resting peacefully when in fact"},"48":{"dur":1,"text":"he is struggling to stay alive,"},"50":{"dur":3,"text":"because he can't regulate his own body temperature."},"53":{"dur":1,"text":"Sadly, there are millions of babies like this"},"55":{"dur":2,"text":"born every year around the world."},"57":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact, 15 million pre-term and underweight babies"},"60":{"dur":1,"text":"are born annually."},"62":{"dur":3,"text":"Three million babies die in the first 28 days of their life."},"65":{"dur":2,"text":"That's six babies every minute."},"69":{"dur":1,"text":"One of the biggest problems"},"70":{"dur":1,"text":"these babies face is staying warm,"},"72":{"dur":2,"text":"and that is the primary function of an incubator."},"75":{"dur":3,"text":"But incubators are expensive, they cost $20,000 upwards,"},"78":{"dur":2,"text":"they require a constant supply of electricity,"},"80":{"dur":2,"text":"they're difficult to operate, so you're not going to find"},"83":{"dur":3,"text":"them in rural areas where many of these babies are dying."},"87":{"dur":3,"text":"In 2007 while I was doing my MBA here at Stanford,"},"90":{"dur":2,"text":"I took a class at the design school that would completely"},"93":{"dur":1,"text":"change my life."},"94":{"dur":2,"text":"Many of you may be familiar with it,"},"96":{"dur":1,"text":"but Design for Extreme Affordability brings together"},"98":{"dur":3,"text":"students of all the different graduate programs"},"101":{"dur":2,"text":"with the goal of creating low-cost technologies for people"},"103":{"dur":2,"text":"living on less than a dollar a day."},"106":{"dur":1,"text":"The challenge posed to my team at the time"},"108":{"dur":2,"text":"was to build a baby incubator that cost less"},"110":{"dur":3,"text":"than 1% of the cost of a traditional incubator,"},"114":{"dur":2,"text":"which in the U.S. is about $20,000."},"116":{"dur":2,"text":"So the first thing we did was to go on the ground"},"119":{"dur":2,"text":"to places like Nepal, and Uganda,"},"122":{"dur":2,"text":"and this is what we would often see."},"125":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is a hospital, neonatal intensive care unit"},"126":{"dur":2,"text":"that's completely overcrowded."},"128":{"dur":2,"text":"Every baby in here is in need of incubation."},"131":{"dur":2,"text":"And then you have a donated incubator"},"133":{"dur":2,"text":"sitting in the corner of the room that's empty."},"136":{"dur":0,"text":"Why?"},"137":{"dur":2,"text":"There's no electricity to power it,"},"139":{"dur":2,"text":"no one has been trained on how to use it."},"141":{"dur":3,"text":"If a part breaks there are no spare parts for replacement."},"145":{"dur":1,"text":"So even when these incubators are free,"},"147":{"dur":1,"text":"when they're donated,"},"148":{"dur":4,"text":"they're not usable because of all these systemic issues."},"153":{"dur":1,"text":"Instead people use solutions like this,"},"155":{"dur":2,"text":"these are old space heaters used to warm babies."},"157":{"dur":2,"text":"You put your hand in front of one of these and you'll"},"159":{"dur":2,"text":"immediately feel it starting to burn."},"162":{"dur":1,"text":"Or lightbulbs."},"163":{"dur":2,"text":"These are the most common solution in India,"},"166":{"dur":2,"text":"where 40% of all the world's premature babies are born."},"168":{"dur":1,"text":"But in every clinic I visited"},"170":{"dur":2,"text":"you hear stories of lightbulbs shattering"},"172":{"dur":2,"text":"over these babies because of problems with the circuits,"},"174":{"dur":3,"text":"so completely unsafe and ineffective solutions out there."},"178":{"dur":2,"text":"From there we traveled to the villages,"},"181":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's where I truly began to understand the problem."},"183":{"dur":2,"text":"This is Sujatha, this is one of the first women I met"},"186":{"dur":2,"text":"in a village in South India."},"188":{"dur":3,"text":"Sujatha gave birth to her baby two months prematurely."},"192":{"dur":1,"text":"She took her baby to a village doctor"},"194":{"dur":2,"text":"who advised her to go to a city hospital"},"196":{"dur":2,"text":"so her baby could be placed in an incubator."},"198":{"dur":2,"text":"That hospital was over four hours away"},"201":{"dur":2,"text":"and she didn't have the money to get there."},"204":{"dur":1,"text":"And so her baby died."},"207":{"dur":3,"text":"And since then I've heard dozens of similar stories."},"210":{"dur":2,"text":"But it was based on stories like that that we realized,"},"212":{"dur":2,"text":"what was needed was not just a lower cost version"},"214":{"dur":2,"text":"of what exists today, we needed something that could"},"216":{"dur":2,"text":"function without a constant supply of electricity"},"219":{"dur":2,"text":"that would be easy enough for a mother or a midwife"},"222":{"dur":3,"text":"or a healthcare worker in a village setting to use."},"225":{"dur":1,"text":"So coming back to Stanford, we went to the drawing board."},"227":{"dur":2,"text":"We wanted something super intuitive to use,"},"230":{"dur":2,"text":"so we created a sleeping bag design."},"232":{"dur":2,"text":"These are literally our first sketches of the product"},"235":{"dur":1,"text":"on the back of a napkin."},"237":{"dur":1,"text":"And then we thought what could maintain heat"},"239":{"dur":3,"text":"at a constant temperature without the need for electricity."},"242":{"dur":3,"text":"We went back to high school physics, to the concept"},"245":{"dur":1,"text":"that when a material changes phases,"},"247":{"dur":3,"text":"let's say from a solid to a liquid, or a liquid to a solid,"},"250":{"dur":2,"text":"it does so at one constant temperature."},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"What if we could find a material that melted at human body"},"255":{"dur":2,"text":"temperature, and then put enough of that substance in"},"258":{"dur":4,"text":"that that melting period took place over hours at a time."},"263":{"dur":1,"text":"We didn't know what that material was,"},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"so we prototyped with the closest thing we could find."},"267":{"dur":1,"text":"This is butter in ziplock bags."},"269":{"dur":1,"text":"We made quite a mess at the D School."},"271":{"dur":2,"text":"From there we went to a Salvation Army,"},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"and we bought everything baby related we could find"},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"and literally started duct taping our first"},"278":{"dur":1,"text":"prototypes together."},"279":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you can see here, our first prototype had a tube"},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"going down the side of the sleeping bag where you would"},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"pour the boiling water and that would melt"},"288":{"dur":1,"text":"the phase change material."},"289":{"dur":1,"text":"Then we showed this to some people and they said to us"},"291":{"dur":3,"text":"it's probably not a good idea to put boiling water"},"294":{"dur":1,"text":"right next to a baby's head."},"295":{"dur":3,"text":"So we quickly scrapped that and moved on"},"298":{"dur":1,"text":"to our next prototype."},"300":{"dur":1,"text":"Here we realized that babies in these countries"},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"often don't wear diapers, so we needed something,"},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"a material that was waterproof and really easy to wipe down."},"307":{"dur":3,"text":"Those were the materials we identified here."},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"And then with those early prototypes we went back to India,"},"313":{"dur":2,"text":"showed them to mothers, to doctors,"},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"to health care workers, and with their feedback"},"318":{"dur":3,"text":"we continued to iterate on the design."},"322":{"dur":1,"text":"We realized the importance of sterility."},"324":{"dur":2,"text":"Because these are all reusable we didn't want babies to"},"326":{"dur":2,"text":"cross-infect each other if they were sick."},"328":{"dur":2,"text":"So we ended up creating this sleeping bag out of one"},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"entire piece of fabric where there are limited seams"},"333":{"dur":3,"text":"on the inside where dirt can collect."},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"Here doctors requested a clear viewing window so they"},"339":{"dur":4,"text":"could observe the baby's breathing and color more easily."},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"And then this was one of my favorite stories."},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"So on the wax pouch, there is a temperature indicator."},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a liquid crystal display that changes color"},"351":{"dur":1,"text":"according to the temperature"},"353":{"dur":1,"text":"so you know when it's too hot or too cold."},"355":{"dur":1,"text":"And as we showed this to the mothers in villages,"},"357":{"dur":2,"text":"we heard something very unusual."},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"They would say to us, we don't trust Western medicine."},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"If you gave me a dosage of medicine for my baby."},"365":{"dur":3,"text":"I would cut it in half because it's too strong."},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you told me to keep this at 37 degrees Celsius,"},"370":{"dur":2,"text":"or 98 degrees fahrenheit, I'd keep it at a little less"},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"than that because that's probably too warm."},"376":{"dur":2,"text":"So that led to a very important design decision"},"378":{"dur":3,"text":"to make it a binary happy face frowning face"},"381":{"dur":1,"text":"instead of a numeric scale."},"383":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that that's really the key to great design,"},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"is empathy and all of these nuances"},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"that are culturally appropriate."},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"When we needed to do more testing,"},"392":{"dur":1,"text":"we used our own family members."},"394":{"dur":0,"text":"This is my nephew"},"395":{"dur":4,"text":"that I stuffed into one of the early prototypes."},"400":{"dur":0,"text":"And so it was in this way"},"401":{"dur":3,"text":"that we tested and retested hundreds of times"},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"over the course of several years"},"405":{"dur":1,"text":"until we were finally ready"},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"to launch the product in 2011."},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"I've got it with me here today."},"414":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is the Embrace Warmer, as you can see"},"416":{"dur":1,"text":"it looks like a little sleeping bag"},"417":{"dur":1,"text":"made out of waterproof materials,"},"419":{"dur":1,"text":"You've got the clear viewing window here,"},"421":{"dur":3,"text":"and in the back, you've got this pouch of wax"},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"that can be melted either with boiling water"},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"or with a short burst of electricity"},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"for places that do have intermittent access to electricity."},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"And once melted it stays at the exact same temperature"},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"for up to eight hours at a stretch."},"438":{"dur":3,"text":"And this can be reheated thousands of times."},"441":{"dur":1,"text":"So you put it into a little pocket in the back"},"443":{"dur":1,"text":"and it creates a warm microenvironment for the baby."},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to pass this around so you guys can"},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"play around with it a bit."},"452":{"dur":3,"text":"So I still remember in 2011 as we were launching the product"},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"in those weeks leading up to our product launch,"},"458":{"dur":3,"text":"everything that could have possibly gone wrong went wrong."},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"The electricity in our manufacturing facility went out"},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"in the most critical moments,"},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"a part of our product got stuck in customs"},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"and they wouldn't release it,"},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"because the wash tags were sewn incorrectly,"},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"but somehow we managed to get that first product"},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"ready to ship to our first customer."},"478":{"dur":1,"text":"And then on the way to that doctor's office,"},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"we got a flat tire."},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughing)"},"483":{"dur":1,"text":"So the whole team jumped out,"},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"we piled into this auto-rickshaw that you see here,"},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"and we delivered our first product."},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"I always tell the story because it's so representative"},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"to me of what entrepreneurship is all about,"},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"which is doing whatever it takes to get past the obstacles"},"496":{"dur":4,"text":"that come in your way and finally reach that end goal."},"502":{"dur":3,"text":"And here is our very first customer."},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"The most exciting part of this journey by far,"},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"has been getting this product into the hands of the families"},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"and the babies who need it the most."},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"And we have been so lucky to get the support"},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"from people of all different walks of life,"},"519":{"dur":3,"text":"who really rallied behind us to help make an impact"},"523":{"dur":1,"text":"with this product."},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"Which really led me to believe this quote from"},"526":{"dur":1,"text":"Paulo Coehlo that I love."},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"He says \"When you truly believe something,"},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"\"the universe will conspire to help you achieve it.\""},"533":{"dur":3,"text":"A few years ago we were invited to present our work"},"537":{"dur":1,"text":"to President Obama at the White House,"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"and that got great visibility for our efforts."},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"We presented a commitment at the Clinton Global Initiative"},"544":{"dur":2,"text":"as well and formed some great partnerships through that."},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"In 2014 Beyonce made a donation to us,"},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"a surprise donation that got our products"},"552":{"dur":3,"text":"into nine countries across Sub-Saharan Africa."},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"So with the help of all of these people,"},"557":{"dur":4,"text":"to date we have been able to help over 200,000 babies."},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"The product is now in 20 countries,"},"564":{"dur":3,"text":"and I'd like to share just a few of the stories"},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"of the babies we've helped."},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is one of my all-time favorite stories,"},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"I always tell this one."},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"This is Nathan."},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"About four years ago we started working with"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"an orphanage in Beijing."},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"A day after we delivered our product,"},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"they called us telling us they had found"},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"a two-pound baby that was abandoned"},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"on a street in central China."},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"They brought Nathan in,"},"590":{"dur":1,"text":"kept him in the warmer for about 30 days,"},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"it was a very scary period for all of us,"},"594":{"dur":3,"text":"we weren't sure if he was going to survive or not."},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"Seven months later I went to visit the orphanage,"},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"and I got to hold Nathan in my arms,"},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"he was this vibrant, interactive little boy,"},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"and it was a very very special experience."},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"The orphanage told me this was the first time"},"610":{"dur":3,"text":"a baby of this size had ever survived there."},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"A few months after this we got an email"},"616":{"dur":1,"text":"from a family in Chicago,"},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"saying they had adopted this little boy"},"620":{"dur":3,"text":"and were traveling to Beijing that summer to bring him home."},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"So here Nathan is with his new family."},"626":{"dur":1,"text":"And when he turned two,"},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"we sent him a warmer for his birthday."},"630":{"dur":4,"text":"You can tell he's outgrown it by just a little bit."},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"And the next story I'm going to show a short video."},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"This is Nissima from Uganda."},"640":{"dur":2,"text":"(guitar music)"},"804":{"dur":1,"text":"- So it's just a few more pictures of the product"},"806":{"dur":1,"text":"being used around the world."},"807":{"dur":3,"text":"This is twins in Uganda while using the Embrace Warmer,"},"811":{"dur":1,"text":"and a few months later."},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"These are some images of the product being used"},"814":{"dur":2,"text":"across Sub-Saharan Africa."},"817":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's been incredibly rewarding and exciting to be a part"},"820":{"dur":3,"text":"of this effort and to create this type of impact."},"824":{"dur":1,"text":"But I would be lying if I were to tell you"},"826":{"dur":1,"text":"that it was all roses and flowers and"},"828":{"dur":3,"text":"that we didn't face some extreme challenges along the way."},"832":{"dur":1,"text":"It's always wonderful to have a vision"},"833":{"dur":1,"text":"of what you want to do,"},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"but, as Mike Tyson says,"},"838":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.\""},"841":{"dur":2,"text":"This has happened to us repeatedly."},"843":{"dur":3,"text":"I could tell you about our challenges for days."},"847":{"dur":2,"text":"But I'll tell you about one pivotal moment for us"},"850":{"dur":2,"text":"that really kind of redefined the business,"},"852":{"dur":3,"text":"and taught me a lot about life as well."},"855":{"dur":3,"text":"So in 2014 I had lived in India for four years."},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"I moved back to the U.S. and at that time"},"861":{"dur":2,"text":"we had been working on a global distribution"},"863":{"dur":3,"text":"and financing deal with a major medical device company."},"867":{"dur":2,"text":"I had been working on this deal day and night"},"870":{"dur":1,"text":"for almost a year at that point,"},"872":{"dur":3,"text":"and then about a week away from signing the deal,"},"875":{"dur":3,"text":"we found out that this company let go of their"},"878":{"dur":3,"text":"healthcare CEO, who was the main advocate for the deal,"},"881":{"dur":2,"text":"and they pulled the plug on our financing."},"884":{"dur":3,"text":"We had seven days of cash left in the bank,"},"887":{"dur":2,"text":"and I was completely devastated."},"890":{"dur":1,"text":"I had no idea what we gonna do."},"891":{"dur":1,"text":"All of us thought we were gonna have to"},"892":{"dur":1,"text":"shut down the company."},"894":{"dur":2,"text":"And then a miracle happened."},"896":{"dur":1,"text":"Nine months prior to that,"},"898":{"dur":2,"text":"I had gone to the World Economic Forum at Davos,"},"900":{"dur":3,"text":"and one morning I went to a meditation session,"},"904":{"dur":2,"text":"which maybe five out of 3,000 people showed up for."},"907":{"dur":3,"text":"And I happened to sit next to Marc Benioff,"},"910":{"dur":3,"text":"who is the founder and CEO of Salesforce."},"914":{"dur":3,"text":"Marc and I started talking, after the meditation session"},"918":{"dur":1,"text":"and I shared with him my work at Embrace."},"920":{"dur":3,"text":"Coincidentally, he was about to make a donation"},"923":{"dur":3,"text":"to create the Preterm Birth Initiative at USCF"},"926":{"dur":3,"text":"in partnership with the Gates Foundation."},"929":{"dur":1,"text":"So if there were anything in the world"},"931":{"dur":1,"text":"that would make me believe in serendipity,"},"932":{"dur":3,"text":"it was the universe seating me next to this man."},"936":{"dur":2,"text":"I kept in touch with Marc, and when this crisis hit,"},"939":{"dur":2,"text":"I sent him an urgent email telling him"},"941":{"dur":2,"text":"what had happened, asking for his help."},"944":{"dur":1,"text":"John Hennessy was one of our advisors,"},"946":{"dur":2,"text":"also reached out to Marc asking for his help."},"948":{"dur":1,"text":"And a few days later, he wrote back"},"950":{"dur":3,"text":"generously agreeing to fund the company."},"954":{"dur":4,"text":"So I'm just so indebted to Marc for saving the company,"},"958":{"dur":4,"text":"we would have had to close our doors if it weren't for that."},"962":{"dur":3,"text":"And it was a really pivotal experience"},"965":{"dur":2,"text":"in a number of different ways,"},"967":{"dur":2,"text":"but one of the things it forced me to do at that point"},"970":{"dur":3,"text":"was to take a step back and really re-evaluate our strategy."},"973":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, at the time we were selling our product"},"976":{"dur":2,"text":"primarily to the Indian government."},"979":{"dur":2,"text":"And working with government contracts"},"981":{"dur":1,"text":"can be extremely painful,"},"983":{"dur":1,"text":"you don't know when the contracts are going to come through,"},"984":{"dur":1,"text":"when you're going to get paid."},"986":{"dur":3,"text":"It wasn't leading to a sustainable business model."},"989":{"dur":2,"text":"At the same time I had started to look at models"},"991":{"dur":1,"text":"like Tom Shoes and Warby Parker,"},"993":{"dur":1,"text":"and the team was thinking,"},"995":{"dur":1,"text":"what if we could leverage our technology"},"996":{"dur":1,"text":"and create a product for the U.S. market"},"998":{"dur":2,"text":"and then use the profits from that"},"1001":{"dur":1,"text":"to fund the expansion of the Embrace Warmers"},"1003":{"dur":2,"text":"in developing countries."},"1007":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that led to the birth of our newest initiative"},"1009":{"dur":2,"text":"which is called Little Lotus."},"1012":{"dur":2,"text":"I was just laughing to myself as I was preparing"},"1014":{"dur":1,"text":"this presentation because this was coincidental,"},"1016":{"dur":3,"text":"but a lotus, the representation of a lotus,"},"1020":{"dur":3,"text":"it's a flower that comes from these dark and muddy waters"},"1023":{"dur":1,"text":"and turns into something beautiful."},"1025":{"dur":1,"text":"So from all the chaos that we've experienced,"},"1027":{"dur":2,"text":"we came up with this really cool product."},"1029":{"dur":2,"text":"And what it is, it's a line of baby products"},"1032":{"dur":2,"text":"for the U.S. market, so sleeping bags, swaddles"},"1034":{"dur":2,"text":"and blankets that have a technology akin"},"1036":{"dur":1,"text":"to the Embrace Warmers."},"1038":{"dur":4,"text":"The fabric of these products is lined with microns of wax."},"1043":{"dur":1,"text":"So this was first used in NASA spacesuits."},"1045":{"dur":3,"text":"And what it does it serves to absorb or release heat"},"1049":{"dur":2,"text":"to keep babies at an ideal skin temperature,"},"1051":{"dur":2,"text":"helping them to sleep better."},"1054":{"dur":2,"text":"Our informal studies have shown that babies sleep on average"},"1057":{"dur":3,"text":"an hour longer with our product versus existing products,"},"1060":{"dur":1,"text":"because of less temperature fluctuations."},"1062":{"dur":3,"text":"But the real impetus for doing this was to implement a"},"1065":{"dur":2,"text":"TOMS Shoes inspired one-to-one model."},"1068":{"dur":1,"text":"So for every Little Lotus that we sell here in the U.S.,"},"1070":{"dur":2,"text":"we help to save a life in a developing country"},"1073":{"dur":2,"text":"with the Embrace Warmer."},"1075":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think the ethos behind doing this,"},"1077":{"dur":2,"text":"as I came back to the U.S. and started doing research,"},"1080":{"dur":3,"text":"I talked to lots of parents, and moms in particular."},"1083":{"dur":1,"text":"I would often hear them say to me,"},"1085":{"dur":1,"text":"you know when I became a mother for the first time,"},"1087":{"dur":2,"text":"I felt an instant comraderie with every other mother"},"1090":{"dur":2,"text":"in the world, and if I saw a baby in need,"},"1092":{"dur":3,"text":"I would do anything to help that child."},"1096":{"dur":2,"text":"So we really wanted to create a global community"},"1098":{"dur":2,"text":"of parents helping other parents."},"1101":{"dur":4,"text":"Another cool aspect of the Little Lotus, you will notice"},"1105":{"dur":1,"text":"that there are handprints all over"},"1107":{"dur":2,"text":"the front panel of the product,"},"1110":{"dur":2,"text":"and that comes from an artwork called Touch Our Future,"},"1112":{"dur":2,"text":"so I collaborated with another Stanford alum,"},"1114":{"dur":2,"text":"Drue Kataoka, she's an amazing artist,"},"1117":{"dur":3,"text":"and her concept was to

directly"},"1126":{"dur":2,"text":"helped by the Embrace Warmers."},"1128":{"dur":2,"text":"In addition to that, we got the hand traces"},"1131":{"dur":3,"text":"of the Dalai Lama and about 20 Nobel Peace Prize Laureates,"},"1134":{"dur":3,"text":"and a bunch of Hollywood celebrities as well."},"1137":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's been a really fun way for people to literally"},"1139":{"dur":2,"text":"lend their hand to this cause."},"1142":{"dur":1,"text":"And with the one-for-one model,"},"1144":{"dur":2,"text":"our hope is that over the next few years"},"1146":{"dur":3,"text":"we are able to reach 1.000.000 babies"},"1150":{"dur":2,"text":"with the Embrace Warmers and truly get the product"},"1152":{"dur":4,"text":"into the hands of every baby and every family who needs it."},"1157":{"dur":3,"text":"So that is my story, that is the last 10 years of my life."},"1161":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is where we're at today."},"1163":{"dur":1,"text":"And I thought I would end by just sharing a few"},"1165":{"dur":4,"text":"of the key lessons that I have learned in this journey."},"1171":{"dur":2,"text":"So the first lesson is to lead with the WHY."},"1173":{"dur":2,"text":"I got this from Simon Sinek's TED talk."},"1175":{"dur":1,"text":"If you haven't watched it I really recommend it."},"1177":{"dur":2,"text":"Why do you do what you do?"},"1180":{"dur":1,"text":"And how does this align with your own purpose"},"1182":{"dur":1,"text":"and your own values?"},"1183":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is so much more important than what you do"},"1185":{"dur":1,"text":"or how you do it."},"1187":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think being really rooted in your purpose"},"1189":{"dur":2,"text":"and being clear about that why,"},"1191":{"dur":1,"text":"it will get you through your toughest moments"},"1193":{"dur":2,"text":"and get you through all those obstacles"},"1195":{"dur":1,"text":"that you're going to face."},"1197":{"dur":1,"text":"And at the same time it will allow you to inspire others"},"1199":{"dur":2,"text":"and rally people behind your cause,"},"1202":{"dur":2,"text":"so give a lot of thought to why it is you want to do"},"1204":{"dur":1,"text":"the things you do."},"1206":{"dur":4,"text":"My second lesson here, from Winston Churchill who said"},"1210":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Success is not final, failure is not fatal."},"1214":{"dur":3,"text":"\"It is the courage to continue that counts.\""},"1217":{"dur":1,"text":"And I have a picture of me surfing here,"},"1218":{"dur":1,"text":"because this is a sport I picked up"},"1220":{"dur":1,"text":"about a year and a half ago,"},"1221":{"dur":2,"text":"that I have become completely obsessed with."},"1224":{"dur":1,"text":"One of the things about surfing,"},"1225":{"dur":2,"text":"it's so humbling, because most of the time"},"1228":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm not on my board, I'm falling off my board,"},"1230":{"dur":2,"text":"and having to find the courage to get back on,"},"1233":{"dur":2,"text":"and paddle back out for the next wave."},"1235":{"dur":2,"text":"And to me, this is the most important trait"},"1238":{"dur":1,"text":"of being an entrepreneur,"},"1239":{"dur":2,"text":"is persistence and tenacity,"},"1241":{"dur":2,"text":"because you will inevitably fail."},"1243":{"dur":1,"text":"Over and over again."},"1245":{"dur":2,"text":"And you need to have the courage and that persistence"},"1247":{"dur":2,"text":"to get back out there, learn from your mistakes,"},"1250":{"dur":1,"text":"and try again."},"1251":{"dur":2,"text":"The other, related thing I've learned"},"1254":{"dur":3,"text":"from surfing and the ocean, is this idea of impermanence."},"1258":{"dur":3,"text":"Everything in this world is constantly changing."},"1261":{"dur":3,"text":"And nothing teaches you that more than being in the ocean,"},"1265":{"dur":3,"text":"where your conditions are changing minute to minute,"},"1268":{"dur":1,"text":"and what that's taught me about"},"1269":{"dur":2,"text":"is this concept of non-attachment,"},"1272":{"dur":4,"text":"to not be attached to anything, including an outcome."},"1276":{"dur":2,"text":"I think I had become so attached to this end outcome"},"1278":{"dur":2,"text":"for Embrace, that the thought of the company"},"1281":{"dur":2,"text":"shutting down in that story I told you,"},"1284":{"dur":2,"text":"really threatened my own sense of identity,"},"1286":{"dur":2,"text":"and what I learned from that process"},"1289":{"dur":4,"text":"is that we are not defined by our successes or our failures,"},"1293":{"dur":2,"text":"we are defined by our values"},"1295":{"dur":1,"text":"and by the journey that we take."},"1297":{"dur":1,"text":"So as cliche as it sounds,"},"1299":{"dur":3,"text":"the journey is truly more important than the destination."},"1302":{"dur":1,"text":"Make sure you're having fun in that journey"},"1304":{"dur":1,"text":"every step of the way."},"1308":{"dur":2,"text":"And my last lesson here, is to choose to see the world"},"1311":{"dur":2,"text":"through the lens of beauty."},"1314":{"dur":1,"text":"Because we get to choose the perspective"},"1315":{"dur":2,"text":"by which we see the world."},"1317":{"dur":1,"text":"After living in India for a few years,"},"1319":{"dur":2,"text":"I could see myself becoming jaded,"},"1322":{"dur":1,"text":"and really pessimistic."},"1323":{"dur":2,"text":"I was dealing with some of the most vulnerable populations"},"1326":{"dur":3,"text":"in the world and saw so many sad things."},"1330":{"dur":2,"text":"I was working in a very corrupt and broken system."},"1332":{"dur":2,"text":"And then at some point I caught myself."},"1335":{"dur":2,"text":"I realized that for every horrible thing that I saw,"},"1337":{"dur":3,"text":"I saw something equally as beautiful."},"1341":{"dur":2,"text":"All of the wonderful people who had come together to help us"},"1343":{"dur":2,"text":"in this cause, all of the noble doctors I met"},"1345":{"dur":3,"text":"who stayed up all night in these villages to see patients."},"1349":{"dur":2,"text":"The most beautiful thing I got to see in my work"},"1351":{"dur":3,"text":"was a love a parent has for their child."},"1355":{"dur":2,"text":"It's the purest and most selfless form of love in the world,"},"1358":{"dur":2,"text":"and I realized that a mother, no matter how poor"},"1360":{"dur":3,"text":"or uneducated or impoverished, will do anything"},"1363":{"dur":1,"text":"to save her child."},"1367":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's the beauty I got to see every day in my work."},"1371":{"dur":1,"text":"So I encourage you to see the world"},"1372":{"dur":2,"text":"through the lens of beauty, because that will give you"},"1374":{"dur":3,"text":"the optimism to keep changing the world."},"1380":{"dur":3,"text":"And I wanted to leave you with one last thought."},"1383":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is the Milan Cathedral."},"1385":{"dur":3,"text":"The great cathedrals of Europe were built over centuries,"},"1389":{"dur":3,"text":"this one the construction began in 1385,"},"1392":{"dur":2,"text":"it wasn't finished until 1965."},"1395":{"dur":1,"text":"What that meant is oftentimes the people who"},"1397":{"dur":2,"text":"spent their whole lives working on these cathedrals"},"1399":{"dur":2,"text":"never lived to see the fruits of their labor,"},"1402":{"dur":4,"text":"nor did their children, nor did their grandchildren."},"1406":{"dur":2,"text":"So why did they dedicate themselves so tirelessly"},"1408":{"dur":2,"text":"to building these monuments?"},"1412":{"dur":1,"text":"I believe it was because they believed in a cause"},"1413":{"dur":3,"text":"that was far greater than themselves."},"1417":{"dur":1,"text":"So I ask each of you to think about,"},"1419":{"dur":2,"text":"what is the cathedral that you want to build?"},"1421":{"dur":2,"text":"And what is the legacy that you want to leave?"},"1423":{"dur":4,"text":"My cathedral is a place where no baby dies from being cold."},"1429":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a place where every parent is empowered"},"1431":{"dur":2,"text":"to save their child, and it's a place"},"1434":{"dur":1,"text":"where the brightest minds come together"},"1436":{"dur":2,"text":"to change the world for the better."},"1438":{"dur":2,"text":"One baby step at a time."},"1440":{"dur":0,"text":"Thank you."},"1442":{"dur":2,"text":"(applause)"},"1452":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Tina] So, would you take some questions please?"},"1454":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, absolutely."},"1455":{"dur":4,"text":"- [Student] You said that Beyonce gave a donation"},"1461":{"dur":1,"text":"but your company also was funded,"},"1462":{"dur":1,"text":"so can you clarify whether it's a non profit"},"1464":{"dur":1,"text":"or a for profit company?"},"1465":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, sure."},"1467":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Student] And then the reasons behind choosing, you know."},"1468":{"dur":1,"text":"- Sure, yep."},"1469":{"dur":2,"text":"So we started as a non-profit, as a 501(c)(3), in 2008"},"1472":{"dur":2,"text":"that's when we first started out."},"1474":{"dur":2,"text":"In 2011 we actually spun out a for-profit arm"},"1477":{"dur":1,"text":"of the company,"},"1478":{"dur":2,"text":"and the idea was that the for-profit"},"1481":{"dur":3,"text":"would sell the product to governments and emerging markets"},"1484":{"dur":2,"text":"and then pay a royalty fee to the non-profit."},"1486":{"dur":1,"text":"We really hoped that that would create"},"1488":{"dur":1,"text":"a self-sustaining model,"},"1490":{"dur":4,"text":"at the time a lot of impact investors were coming into play"},"1494":{"dur":2,"text":"as well, encouraging us to explore a for-profit route,"},"1497":{"dur":1,"text":"which is an easier way to raise capital."},"1498":{"dur":1,"text":"So the real reason for doing it was"},"1500":{"dur":2,"text":"so we could leverage both philanthropic capital"},"1502":{"dur":2,"text":"to donate the product to the poorest places,"},"1505":{"dur":1,"text":"as well as private capital"},"1506":{"dur":4,"text":"to do the more capital intensive parts of our work."},"1511":{"dur":0,"text":"Yes?"},"1512":{"dur":2,"text":"- [Male Student] Can you speak to the design constraints"},"1514":{"dur":3,"text":"or some of the thinking behind going down this approach"},"1518":{"dur":4,"text":"versus something like NeoNurture, which is basically"},"1523":{"dur":2,"text":"an incubator run by a car battery"},"1526":{"dur":2,"text":"and a couple of Toyota headlights."},"1528":{"dur":2,"text":"I know that was an alternative approach some tokens met."},"1530":{"dur":1,"text":"- Sure, so I think it goes--"},"1532":{"dur":1,"text":"(instructor mumbling)"},"1533":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes, and so the question was the thinking behind,"},"1534":{"dur":3,"text":"going behind this design approach and creating something"},"1538":{"dur":3,"text":"that could be used kind of in a home setting as opposed to,"},"1541":{"dur":3,"text":"there's another product out there that's used out of spare"},"1544":{"dur":2,"text":"car parts, for example, that looks more like a traditional"},"1546":{"dur":2,"text":"incubator, so I think for us, our a-ha moment"},"1549":{"dur":2,"text":"was the story I mentioned where we went into the villages,"},"1552":{"dur":3,"text":"and we realized that we could design for a big city,"},"1555":{"dur":2,"text":"hospital setting, but that wasn't where the real problem was"},"1558":{"dur":2,"text":"and we really wanted to create a product that could sit"},"1560":{"dur":1,"text":"in a village setting,"},"1562":{"dur":2,"text":"that would require very minimal training,"},"1565":{"dur":4,"text":"because that's where we felt the root of the problem was."},"1571":{"dur":0,"text":"Yes."},"1572":{"dur":3,"text":"- [Female Student] Hi, I noticed that you seemed to be"},"1576":{"dur":2,"text":"working with people from the region."},"1579":{"dur":2,"text":"So are they becoming part of your team?"},"1581":{"dur":1,"text":"How was the dynamics?"},"1583":{"dur":2,"text":"When you moved from the U.S. to places"},"1585":{"dur":2,"text":"where you didn't have actual partners,"},"1588":{"dur":2,"text":"how do you work with these people?"},"1592":{"dur":1,"text":"Are they your partners, are they just helping you,"},"1593":{"dur":1,"text":"can you talk about this?"},"1595":{"dur":3,"text":"- Sure, in India we were situated there for the first"},"1598":{"dur":2,"text":"four years, really built up a local team and hired people"},"1601":{"dur":3,"text":"on the ground as well as worked with partners,"},"1604":{"dur":2,"text":"both in governments and non profits, and so on."},"1607":{"dur":2,"text":"In other countries that we worked in,"},"1610":{"dur":2,"text":"we do work with a partnership model,"},"1612":{"dur":1,"text":"so we work with the Millennium Villages across"},"1614":{"dur":1,"text":"Sub-Saharan Africa."},"1615":{"dur":1,"text":"We work with a non-profit in Afghanistan,"},"1617":{"dur":3,"text":"for example, we've just started a project with one in Nepal."},"1620":{"dur":1,"text":"So our thinking there is that we really rely"},"1622":{"dur":1,"text":"on the expertise of our local partners"},"1624":{"dur":3,"text":"who are already working on newborn care issues,"},"1627":{"dur":2,"text":"who can then easily integrate the Embrace Warmers"},"1630":{"dur":1,"text":"into those programs."},"1632":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's very unusual that we will have our own staff"},"1634":{"dur":1,"text":"on the ground, we really train our local partners"},"1636":{"dur":2,"text":"to implement the product."},"1640":{"dur":0,"text":"Yes?"},"1641":{"dur":2,"text":"- [Male Student] The design of this is so much easier to use"},"1644":{"dur":2,"text":"and so much cheaper than the solutions"},"1647":{"dur":1,"text":"in developed countries."},"1649":{"dur":2,"text":"Is there a reason why that product can't enter into"},"1651":{"dur":1,"text":"those markets?"},"1653":{"dur":1,"text":"- Into developed countries?"},"1654":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Male Student] Yeah, like, say in the U.S. healthcare?"},"1656":{"dur":3,"text":"- Okay, so the question is why can't the product enter the"},"1659":{"dur":1,"text":"U.S. healthcare system."},"1660":{"dur":2,"text":"It definitely can, in fact we have done a first study"},"1663":{"dur":2,"text":"at Lucile Packard showing that you can wean babies off"},"1665":{"dur":3,"text":"of incubators and put them in this device instead."},"1669":{"dur":3,"text":"It just requires a different road in terms of getting"},"1673":{"dur":3,"text":"an FDA approval, for example, putting our resources there,"},"1676":{"dur":2,"text":"and then really changing behavior here,"},"1679":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's a whole other set of issues,"},"1680":{"dur":2,"text":"because although kind of intellectually it seems like"},"1683":{"dur":1,"text":"a much easier product to use,"},"1684":{"dur":2,"text":"changing doctor's behaviors and changing systems around that"},"1686":{"dur":2,"text":"can be very challenging, and so for the time being,"},"1689":{"dur":4,"text":"we've decided to focus the warmers on emerging markets"},"1693":{"dur":0,"text":"and really have the consumer product here"},"1694":{"dur":2,"text":"that allows us to fund that."},"1698":{"dur":0,"text":"Yeah?"},"1699":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Female Student] People in developing countries"},"1701":{"dur":2,"text":"are very critical\n(male coughing)"},"1703":{"dur":2,"text":"of the product, so how to teach?"},"1706":{"dur":3,"text":"- The question was how did we get people over their"},"1710":{"dur":2,"text":"criticism of the product."},"1713":{"dur":4,"text":"You know, I don't know if I would use the word criticism,"},"1718":{"dur":2,"text":"but it did require us to show doctors, for example,"},"1721":{"dur":4,"text":"as well as the standard of care in these settings,"},"1727":{"dur":3,"text":"and then have enough experience there that with influencers"},"1731":{"dur":2,"text":"especially and key opinion leaders in these markets,"},"1734":{"dur":2,"text":"that they could influence others and really use that"},"1736":{"dur":3,"text":"word of mouth and the trust in the product and the company"},"1740":{"dur":2,"text":"to get it out there further."},"1743":{"dur":2,"text":"Also I think it was also helpful for people to see that"},"1745":{"dur":2,"text":"we had really situated ourselves locally,"},"1748":{"dur":2,"text":"that we were catering towards the market,"},"1750":{"dur":2,"text":"it wasn't just something we had developed here at Stanford"},"1753":{"dur":2,"text":"and try to implant in these countries,"},"1755":{"dur":3,"text":"but we had really taken into account all of the systemic"},"1759":{"dur":4,"text":"issues that led to the product being more appropriate."},"1765":{"dur":2,"text":"It took the first, well, the development of the"},"1767":{"dur":2,"text":"product took about two years in the clinical assessing,"},"1769":{"dur":2,"text":"probably two and a half years, and then it's been,"},"1772":{"dur":1,"text":"you know that was 2011,"},"1774":{"dur":3,"text":"so it's been 5 or 6 years since then, yeah."},"1777":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's still ongoing."},"1778":{"dur":3,"text":"We're barely at the tip of the iceberg here in terms of the"},"1782":{"dur":1,"text":"impact we hope to create."},"1783":{"dur":2,"text":"It's been much more challenging and taken a lot more time"},"1786":{"dur":1,"text":"than we anticipated."},"1788":{"dur":0,"text":"Yes?"},"1790":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Woman] Wonderful presentation."},"1791":{"dur":1,"text":"Two questions."},"1792":{"dur":4,"text":"What is the cost per warmer, and how do you pick"},"1796":{"dur":3,"text":"societies to participate in the program?"},"1802":{"dur":2,"text":"Do they reach out to you, or do you reach out to them?"},"1804":{"dur":3,"text":"Because you know there's a whole bunch of politics"},"1807":{"dur":1,"text":"and ecological issues."},"1810":{"dur":1,"text":"How do you choose between these?"},"1812":{"dur":1,"text":"- Sure, so the question was what is the cost per warmer"},"1813":{"dur":2,"text":"and how do we decide to go into certain communities?"},"1816":{"dur":3,"text":"So the cost per warmer is about $200 per each warmer,"},"1820":{"dur":2,"text":"and that includes the sleeping bag,"},"1822":{"dur":2,"text":"the wax insert that you saw, and a separate heating unit."},"1825":{"dur":3,"text":"The product is entirely reusable and so we estimate the cost"},"1829":{"dur":3,"text":"of saving a single life with the product,"},"1832":{"dur":2,"text":"including shipping, logistics, everything else,"},"1834":{"dur":3,"text":"is roughly about $10 per life saved."},"1837":{"dur":2,"text":"And in terms of going into communities, we really,"},"1840":{"dur":1,"text":"I think a lot of it depends on the partners"},"1842":{"dur":1,"text":"we were able to find."},"1843":{"dur":2,"text":"Because even with a great technology you really need"},"1845":{"dur":2,"text":"to find effective partners who can implement,"},"1847":{"dur":1,"text":"who can do the training,"},"1849":{"dur":3,"text":"who can do the data collection and monitoring."},"1852":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we really rely on this wonderful network"},"1854":{"dur":3,"text":"of NGOs on the ground that are specifically focused"},"1858":{"dur":2,"text":"on newborn care, that that's already a part of the"},"1860":{"dur":1,"text":"work that they're doing, and then we can"},"1862":{"dur":2,"text":"kind of slot this technology in."},"1866":{"dur":2,"text":"With India though, we just chose to move to India right away"},"1868":{"dur":1,"text":"purely because of the numbers."},"1870":{"dur":2,"text":"As I said, India has 40% of all the world's"},"1872":{"dur":2,"text":"premature babies, and so it was a no-brainer that that's"},"1874":{"dur":2,"text":"where we were gonna start."},"1878":{"dur":3,"text":"(mumbling and coughing)"},"1882":{"dur":2,"text":"- [Tina] What do you see, what would your talk be"},"1885":{"dur":1,"text":"eight years from now?"},"1886":{"dur":1,"text":"What will happen between now and then?"},"1888":{"dur":1,"text":"- (laughing) That's a great question."},"1889":{"dur":1,"text":"So I think for us it's a couple of things."},"1891":{"dur":2,"text":"It's our hope to really get this into the hands"},"1893":{"dur":3,"text":"of every baby who needs it, make it universally available"},"1897":{"dur":1,"text":"and adopted technology."},"1900":{"dur":0,"text":"The other thing though is"},"1901":{"dur":2,"text":"we would love to work on new technologies."},"1904":{"dur":2,"text":"The dream was always how do we create a platform"},"1906":{"dur":3,"text":"by which we introduce other technologies that reduce"},"1909":{"dur":2,"text":"infant deaths around the world."},"1912":{"dur":1,"text":"If you look at the Millennium Development goals,"},"1913":{"dur":2,"text":"reducing infant mortality was one of them,"},"1916":{"dur":2,"text":"and that was the one we made the least progress on,"},"1918":{"dur":1,"text":"over a decade of time."},"1920":{"dur":1,"text":"And so it's always ironic to me that we sit here"},"1922":{"dur":3,"text":"in Silicon Valley with all of this high-tech everything"},"1926":{"dur":3,"text":"around us and yet so many babies are dying every single day,"},"1930":{"dur":1,"text":"you know, how could that be?"},"1931":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we are currently working on integrating sensors"},"1934":{"dur":3,"text":"into the product, and trying to do a remote monitoring"},"1937":{"dur":2,"text":"and eventually leveraging AI,"},"1941":{"dur":3,"text":"we'd love to do predictive diagnostics."},"1946":{"dur":0,"text":"Yeah?"},"1947":{"dur":3,"text":"- [Female Student] So this product requires like a really"},"1951":{"dur":2,"text":"deep knowledge of biology and healthcare systems,"},"1953":{"dur":4,"text":"and I was wondering what kind of techniques or advice"},"1957":{"dur":3,"text":"you had for people who want to develop products in fields"},"1960":{"dur":3,"text":"that they're not very knowledgeable or experienced in?"},"1964":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, that's a great question."},"1965":{"dur":4,"text":"We have three co-founders and none of us had any experience"},"1970":{"dur":3,"text":"in material science, or medical experience"},"1973":{"dur":1,"text":"and we came up with this."},"1974":{"dur":1,"text":"I think the key is really just to surround yourself"},"1976":{"dur":2,"text":"with a group of advisors who do have that depth"},"1978":{"dur":1,"text":"of knowledge."},"1980":{"dur":3,"text":"We formed a wonderful advisory board both here locally"},"1983":{"dur":3,"text":"as well as one in India, and they really led both"},"1986":{"dur":3,"text":"the clinical studies and collecting all of that"},"1990":{"dur":2,"text":"scientific data around the product."},"1992":{"dur":3,"text":"Also with this, there was no set regulations"},"1995":{"dur":2,"text":"on how to do this, we didn't fit neatly"},"1998":{"dur":2,"text":"into a regulatory system, and so they provided"},"2000":{"dur":2,"text":"that deep guidance as well."},"2003":{"dur":1,"text":"And then once we moved to India,"},"2004":{"dur":2,"text":"we had this team of people who were really enthusiastic"},"2007":{"dur":1,"text":"and passionate and could see things"},"2008":{"dur":1,"text":"through a different lens."},"2009":{"dur":1,"text":"It is important to counterbalance that with"},"2011":{"dur":3,"text":"people who have deep experience of things like"},"2015":{"dur":3,"text":"creating a rigorous quality control system"},"2019":{"dur":2,"text":"and who know manufacturing."},"2021":{"dur":2,"text":"So I would say surround yourself with experts,"},"2023":{"dur":2,"text":"either advisors or people that you bring internally"},"2026":{"dur":1,"text":"into your organization."},"2030":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Tina] I'm gonna ask another question."},"2032":{"dur":2,"text":"So this story is so impressive,"},"2035":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's one that's used often to celebrate the design"},"2039":{"dur":1,"text":"thinking process."},"2041":{"dur":2,"text":"And you guys were in the first class of the--"},"2043":{"dur":1,"text":"- Second class."},"2044":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Tina] Second class"},"2045":{"dur":1,"text":"of Design for Extreme Affordability."},"2047":{"dur":1,"text":"Are there
