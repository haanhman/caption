department"},"150":{"dur":5,"text":"for is vaccines, immunizations, shots, they're\nall really the same thing."},"155":{"dur":2,"text":"How did those vaccines work to prevent illness?"},"158":{"dur":1,"text":">>Susan Hays:How do they work?"},"160":{"dur":4,"text":"Well that\u2019s a really big question and we\nneed a scientist to answer that."},"164":{"dur":9,"text":"But basically in a nutshell what vaccines\ndo is they take your body and it's like infecting"},"174":{"dur":7,"text":"it with a little bit of that illness and having\nyour immune system respond to it."},"182":{"dur":4,"text":"And then the immune system then says \"hey\nI've seen that before I know what it's all"},"186":{"dur":3,"text":"about and I'm going to take care of it before\nit becomes a

mean"},"207":{"dur":1,"text":"that you will never get it."},"209":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Banks:Ok."},"210":{"dur":3,"text":"So people who say \"oh I got the flu shot I\ngot the flu anyway\" it could have actually"},"214":{"dur":1,"text":"been a different strain of flu."},"215":{"dur":2,"text":">>Susan Hays:It could have been or it maybe\nwasn't the flu."},"217":{"dur":5,"text":"Sometimes what

flu that seems to be the"},"226":{"dur":7,"text":"thing that probably most people are coming\nin contact with, and that's the flu vaccine."},"234":{"dur":3,"text":"Who and how does one figure out \"this is the\nkind of flu we're going to have."},"237":{"dur":3,"text":"We're going to mix up this kind of vaccine\nfor this year\u201d?"},"240":{"dur":1,"text":"How does that work?"},"241":{"dur":6,"text":">>Susan Hays:Well there's in excess of 100\nnational flu centers around the nation everywhere"},"248":{"dur":7,"text":"and they follow the flu strains, the flu activity\nworldwide all year long."},"256":{"dur":6,"text":"And they feed the data into one of the World\nHealth Organization sites in the United States;"},"262":{"dur":3,"text":"it's in Atlanta, Georgia with the Center for\nDisease Control."},"265":{"dur":7,"text":"That data gets fed into it and then really\nsmart people take a look at that data and"},"272":{"dur":8,"text":"in February make a decision on what strains\nthey think will be prevalent for the following"},"280":{"dur":1,"text":"flu season."},"281":{"dur":3,"text":"Because think about this, in February we're\nstill in the flu season so they're looking"},"285":{"dur":1,"text":"into the next year."},"287":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Banks:Ok."},"288":{"dur":5,"text":"So sometimes they don't hit the mark, which\nhappened in 2014, is that correct?"},"293":{"dur":3,"text":">>Susan Hays:Sometimes they don't hit the\nmark."},"296":{"dur":6,"text":"In fact if you go back to the H1N1 flu season\nthat's a perfect example of when we had this"},"303":{"dur":3,"text":"antigenic shift of flu."},"306":{"dur":7,"text":"And all of a sudden we had this really nasty\nflu that reared its ugly head and said, \"Hey,"},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm here and I'm going to hurt some people.\""},"316":{"dur":5,"text":"And at that point then the vaccine manufacturers\nwent \"let's get busy."},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's manufacture a strain.\""},"324":{"dur":5,"text":"Now they don't always do an additional flu\nshot, it depends on how serious that additional"},"329":{"dur":1,"text":"flu strain is."},"331":{"dur":6,"text":"But you're right; in 2014 we had a strain\nthat wasn't in there that ended up kind of"},"337":{"dur":1,"text":"making some people sick."},"338":{"dur":5,"text":">>Lori Banks:So you hear this especially when\nflu shot season comes up and people will say"},"344":{"dur":4,"text":"\"Well I got the flu shot and then I got the\nflu.\""},"348":{"dur":1,"text":"What's happening with that?"},"349":{"dur":2,"text":">>Susan Hays:Well, let me explain."},"351":{"dur":8,"text":"The flu shot is an inactivated virus so it\ncan't make you sick with the flu."},"360":{"dur":7,"text":"But what happens is when you get an immunization\nyour immune system is stimulated to work."},"367":{"dur":7,"text":"And so sometimes what people perceive as being\na reaction to the flu shot, i.e. flu, is not"},"375":{"dur":1,"text":"really the flu."},"376":{"dur":6,"text":"So you get a flu shot and occasionally people,\nand it's not real common, will have some body"},"383":{"dur":4,"text":"aches after or maybe a little tiredness for\na day or two after."},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"That's your immune system responding and working."},"389":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Banks:Doing what it\u2019s supposed to."},"390":{"dur":4,"text":">>Susan Hays:Doing what it\u2019s supposed to\ndo, exactly."},"394":{"dur":5,"text":"If you get the full fledged flu a couple of\ndays after you got the flu shot it's not because"},"400":{"dur":3,"text":"the flu shot didn't work it's because you\ndidn't get the flu shot soon enough."},"403":{"dur":7,"text":"It takes about a week to 2 weeks for the flu\nshot to stimulate your immune system for it"},"411":{"dur":2,"text":"to actually prevent the flu."},"413":{"dur":5,"text":"So if you were exposed, you got it, and unfortunately\nit wasn't soon enough."},"419":{"dur":4,"text":">>Lori Banks:I've noticed this too, some years\nthe flu shot I have more pain in my shoulders"},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"and then some years not."},"426":{"dur":1,"text":"So what's that about?"},"428":{"dur":4,"text":">>Susan Hays:Well it's a different formulation\neach year and vaccines are different formulations."},"432":{"dur":5,"text":"So some can cause a little more discomfort\nthan others, but here's my advice to everybody,"},"438":{"dur":3,"text":"sometimes it has to do with the way we feel\nor think about something."},"442":{"dur":6,"text":"And if you're tense about that shot, or if\nyou're tense about life in general that day,"},"449":{"dur":5,"text":"when you tense up your muscle it's more difficult\nto put that vaccine into your arm and you'll"},"454":{"dur":1,"text":"feel it more."},"455":{"dur":5,"text":"So if you can relax your arm when you take\nyour shot, even for those ones that might"},"461":{"dur":1,"text":"hurt a little bit more, it's going to hurt\nless."},"462":{"dur":4,"text":">>Lori Banks:How come some vaccines are given\nin different places than others?"},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that's another common question."},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"Why is it here and not here?"},"471":{"dur":8,"text":">>Susan Hays:Well it's based on all the studies\nthat they did on how well the vaccine performs"},"479":{"dur":4,"text":"being given in the muscle as compared to being\ngiven in the subcutaneous tissue as being"},"484":{"dur":5,"text":"given in an oral form or in an intranasal\nform, how does it work the best?"},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's the form that it is given in."},"492":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Banks:Ok."},"493":{"dur":5,"text":"Let's talk a little bit about the most common\nvaccines that you're administering at your"},"499":{"dur":1,"text":"department."},"500":{"dur":4,"text":">>Susan Hays:We administer all of the childhood\nvaccines that are on the recommended schedule."},"504":{"dur":3,"text":"And when you say \"common\" we commonly administer\nthem all."},"508":{"dur":4,"text":"We probably do, on average, about 150 vaccinations\na month."},"512":{"dur":3,"text":"So we do a lot of shots and it's all the stuff\nthat we have."},"516":{"dur":3,"text":"With the adult vaccines it's a little different\nfor us because we're a small health department."},"520":{"dur":4,"text":"We don't see as many travelers so we don't\nalways carry travel vaccines, some of the"},"524":{"dur":4,"text":"more obscure travel vaccines, but we do carry\na lot of the adult vaccines also."},"529":{"dur":6,"text":">>Lori Banks:I want to get into this; you\ncalled it a schedule of childhood vaccines."},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"Who decides what a child needs?"},"538":{"dur":3,"text":"Because I know for parents out there it seems\nlike \"Wow this is a lot.\""},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"And it seems to be more than it used to be."},"543":{"dur":5,"text":">>Susan Hays:The decision is based on a bunch\nof, once again, smart people."},"549":{"dur":7,"text":"The ACIP, which is the Advisory Committee\non Immunization Practices, set the standards"},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"for what we should vaccinate here in this\ncountry."},"560":{"dur":6,"text":"The Center for Disease Control also publishes\nthat information for us all and it has changed"},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"over the years."},"568":{"dur":3,"text":">>Lori Banks:And what have you seen in your\ntime in public health?"},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"What have been some of the biggest changes?"},"574":{"dur":2,"text":">>Susan Hays:In vaccinations?"},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, vaccinations like medical care are always\nchanging."},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"There are always different changes."},"582":{"dur":1,"text":"We get new vaccines."},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"We have vaccines that are changed."},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"We have medical care that has changed."},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not a stagnant thing."},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"Medical care isn't stagnant and it never will\nbe."},"592":{"dur":4,"text":"The reason things change so much is because\nwe want to keep the population as healthy"},"597":{"dur":3,"text":"as possible and we figure out new ways to\ndo that."},"601":{"dur":7,"text":"So some of the more recent changes in vaccines\nwe've added to the schedule of vaccines like"},"608":{"dur":5,"text":"the HPV vaccine, the meningitis vaccine is\nnow on the schedule since I've been there."},"613":{"dur":6,"text":"We have a lot more combination vaccinations,\nthat means more than one in a shot so that"},"620":{"dur":4,"text":"it's easier to administer and easier for someone\nto take."},"624":{"dur":3,"text":"So some of those things are things that I've\nseen over the 15 years I've been there."},"628":{"dur":2,"text":">>Lori Banks:Alright, this is a common question\nyou get."},"631":{"dur":6,"text":"We want to talk about exemptions for vaccinations\nbecause that has been in the news and talked"},"637":{"dur":1,"text":"about a lot."},"639":{"dur":5,"text":"Kind of set up how that works and is it the\nsame from state to state?"},"645":{"dur":2,"text":">>Susan Hays:Well no, it's not."},"647":{"dur":1,"text":"We all do things a little differently."},"649":{"dur":5,"text":"You can have 1 of 3 exemptions of going into\nschool; a medical exemption, which anyone"},"654":{"dur":4,"text":"is going to accept, and that means that you\nmedically cannot have that vaccine for some"},"658":{"dur":4,"text":"reason, religious exemption or philosophical\nexemption."},"663":{"dur":4,"text":"There are a number of states that allow all\n3 of those."},"667":{"dur":6,"text":"There are most of the states, if you look\nat the average, allow for a religious and"},"673":{"dur":1,"text":"medical exemption."},"674":{"dur":5,"text":"And there is one state now in the last year\nthat allows only for a medical exemption and"},"679":{"dur":1,"text":"that's California."},"680":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Banks:Ok."},"681":{"dur":1,"text":"What does Illinois have?"},"682":{"dur":3,"text":">>Susan Hays:Illinois has the religious and\nthe medical exemption."},"686":{"dur":6,"text":"So if you don't want to vaccinate your kids\nit would fall underneath a physician saying"},"693":{"dur":4,"text":"medically that child cannot have that vaccine\nor you have to go through a process to claim"},"697":{"dur":1,"text":"a religious exemption."},"698":{"dur":5,"text":">>Lori Banks:So are there more people not\ngetting their kids vaccinated?"},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"In your practice, is that what you're seeing?"},"706":{"dur":4,"text":">>Susan Hays:I wouldn't say that we're having\nmore people not giving their kids vaccinations."},"711":{"dur":3,"text":"I would say there's a been a little bit of\na shift."},"714":{"dur":11,"text":"And what we're seeing is people that are questioning\nvaccines are instead of used to be that it"},"726":{"dur":4,"text":"was folks that really didn't know anything\nabout vaccines and now it's people that are"},"731":{"dur":4,"text":"accessing the internet, which is wonderful\nwe all love it for great things, and they're"},"735":{"dur":5,"text":"pulling information off the internet but it\nmight not be a good site that's giving valid,"},"741":{"dur":3,"text":"accurate information about immunizations."},"744":{"dur":4,"text":"And if you don't know where to go, some of\nthese sites are great."},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean they look wonderful, they look very\nprofessional, and they look like they know"},"752":{"dur":4,"text":"what they're doing, but it's often not accurate\ninformation."},"756":{"dur":4,"text":"And so there\u2019s a little bit of a, maybe,\nfear in there for parents that the vaccine"},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"is going to harm the child or cause issues."},"763":{"dur":5,"text":">>Lori Banks:So if someone here in the state\nof Illinois wants to file an exemption it's"},"769":{"dur":3,"text":"a little more involved than just filling out\na piece of paper."},"772":{"dur":1,"text":">>Susan Hays:That changed this year."},"774":{"dur":8,"text":"The reason that it changed this year is simply\nbecause that we're starting to see some outbreaks"},"783":{"dur":6,"text":"in certain vaccine preventable diseases because\nwe're not having enough vaccination done or"},"789":{"dur":1,"text":"other issues."},"791":{"dur":9,"text":"And that puts us all at risk for illnesses\nand the general thought is that people may"},"800":{"dur":4,"text":"not be well educated on vaccines and fully\nunderstand the importance and why they're"},"805":{"dur":1,"text":"there."},"806":{"dur":4,"text":"And so now, in order to claim a religious\nexemption you have to take a form to your"},"811":{"dur":4,"text":"doctor, the doctor is then responsible for\neducating you and discussing the benefits"},"815":{"dur":6,"text":"of vaccines and then he can then decide to\nsign the form for you and then you can take"},"822":{"dur":1,"text":"it to the school."},"823":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Banks:\nOk so it's a little more involved."},"824":{"dur":1,"text":">>Susan Hays:It's a little more involved."},"825":{"dur":1,"text":"It makes you think more about vaccines."},"827":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Banks:Is that just here in the state\nof Illinois?"},"829":{"dur":5,"text":"Or are more states kind of making the process\na little more education based?"},"834":{"dur":1,"text":">>Susan Hays:Yes."},"836":{"dur":3,"text":"It's in the state of Illinois and some other\nstates are also coming on board."},"840":{"dur":4,"text":"California is a perfect example; they no longer\naccept anything but a medical exemption where"},"844":{"dur":5,"text":"the physician says this child cannot have\nthis vaccine for x, y, z reasons."},"850":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Banks:Ok."},"851":{"dur":6,"text":"Let's talk about outbreaks because in the\nfall of 2015, specifically on EIU's campus,"},"857":{"dur":5,"text":"we had outbreaks of mumps, which we haven\u2019t\nheard of that in a long time."},"862":{"dur":3,"text":"And we've heard in other years of outbreaks\nof measles."},"866":{"dur":1,"text":"Why is that happening?"},"867":{"dur":1,"text":">>Susan Hays:Ok."},"868":{"dur":2,"text":"There are a number of different reasons for\nthat."},"871":{"dur":4,"text":"Let's start with the fact that we just identified\nthat some people are not getting vaccinated."},"875":{"dur":5,"text":"And if you're not vaccinated you're at risk\nto pick up illnesses."},"881":{"dur":3,"text":"We are a very mobile society now."},"884":{"dur":5,"text":"We don't just stay on the farm like we used\nto, we travel, and we have international travelers."},"890":{"dur":4,"text":"And especially on your Eastern campus or the\nUniversity of Illinois or any of the other"},"895":{"dur":4,"text":"campuses you have people from all different\ncountries coming in that can be coming in"},"900":{"dur":4,"text":"with certain things even though we may not\nsee as much of it here."},"904":{"dur":6,"text":"So part of it is the fact that some people\nare choosing not to vaccinate."},"910":{"dur":8,"text":"Vaccines require a certain number of immunizations\nto get a good efficacy."},"919":{"dur":6,"text":"So if you had a measles vaccine and you didn't\nget the second one, that's another reasons"},"925":{"dur":3,"text":"why you could potentially, come down with\nit."},"929":{"dur":3,"text":"Measles, Mumps, Rubella is a combination vaccine."},"932":{"dur":2,"text":"It's the MMR, correct."},"935":{"dur":7,"text":"So you got the first one and for Mumps it's\ngoing to give you about a 78% effectiveness"},"942":{"dur":4,"text":"and you were exposed and fell in that group\nof folks that didn't get a good uptake on"},"946":{"dur":2,"text":"it and you could get it in that way."},"949":{"dur":4,"text":"Another way that you can get it is you have\nhad all your vaccinations but for some reason"},"954":{"dur":1,"text":"your immune system is compromised."},"955":{"dur":4,"text":"You're depressed because you have an illness\nor because you're elderly."},"960":{"dur":4,"text":"The older we get the less effective our immune\nsystem works."},"964":{"dur":7,"text":"So you end up with simply an immune system\nthat says, \"Hey I had those shots\" or \"I've"},"972":{"dur":5,"text":"been exposed and whoa, here it came back and\nI'm not going to work well for you.\""},"977":{"dur":2,"text":"So there are a number of different reasons\nthat can occur."},"979":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Banks:Ok, so it's not just 1."},"981":{"dur":1,"text":">>Susan Hays:\nNot just 1."},"983":{"dur":4,"text":">>Lori Banks:So you talked about, from what\nI remember, they're booster shots."},"987":{"dur":4,"text":"Which ones should you be getting that second\nshot, the booster shot?"},"991":{"dur":2,"text":">>Susan Hays:All of them are a little bit\ndifferent."},"993":{"dur":3,"text":"So some vaccines require 2 shots."},"996":{"dur":3,"text":"Some vaccines like the yearly flu, it's just\n1."},"1000":{"dur":2,"text":"Some vaccines have 3."},"1002":{"dur":1,"text":"Some have 4."},"1004":{"dur":3,"text":"Some get a booster every 10 years, that's\nyour tetanus booster."},"1007":{"dur":3,"text":"It really varies vaccine to vaccine."},"1010":{"dur":5,"text":">>Lori Banks:And this is always hard when\nyou go to the doctor, especially if you maybe"},"1016":{"dur":1,"text":"don't keep track of it."},"1017":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't remember when I had what."},"1020":{"dur":5,"text":"So what do you recommend for adults?"},"1026":{"dur":2,"text":"Vaccines for adults and remembering what do\nI need when?"},"1028":{"dur":1,"text":">>Susan Hays:What do I need?"},"1029":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, it can be a little complicated, that's\nwhy you want to rely on your doctor to help"},"1034":{"dur":2,"text":"you out with that or your health department."},"1037":{"dur":7,"text":"But with your adults, as long as you've had\nyour primary series of childhood vaccines"},"1044":{"dur":3,"text":"and kept up with that, the things that you\nwant to remember are your tetanus booster."},"1048":{"dur":4,"text":"You want to be sure and get that and you want\nto have a Tdap if you haven't had it, which"},"1052":{"dur":4,"text":"has the pertussis or whopping cough component\nin it."},"1056":{"dur":5,"text":"Because we can, as adults, get whopping cough\nand pass it on to other people."},"1062":{"dur":1,"text":"For us it's an annoyance."},"1063":{"dur":3,"text":"If you're a normal healthy person it's called\nthe 100-day cough for a reason because you"},"1067":{"dur":2,"text":"will cough your head off for 100 days."},"1070":{"dur":4,"text":"But for an infant or a young child it can\nhospitalize them and it can actually kill"},"1074":{"dur":1,"text":"them."},"1075":{"dur":5,"text":"So you want to be sure and get that especially\nif you have young kids or you're around anyone"},"1081":{"dur":4,"text":"that is elderly that can end up hospitalized\nfor something like that."},"1085":{"dur":8,"text":">>Lori Banks:Alright, what about we see shots\nnow for shingles as older adults and pneumonia"},"1093":{"dur":1,"text":"and other things."},"1095":{"dur":1,"text":">>Susan Hays:Ok."},"1096":{"dur":3,"text":"So, the pneumonia shot, once you get to be\na certain age your doctor is going to let"},"1099":{"dur":2,"text":"you know about that, but it depends on your\nhealth status."},"1102":{"dur":3,"text":"You might get it younger, you might not need\nit until you're 60 or older."},"1105":{"dur":4,"text":"There are 2 vaccines out there and your doctor\nwill tell you whether you need one or both"},"1109":{"dur":1,"text":"vaccines."},"1110":{"dur":5,"text":"But they help prevent bacterial pneumonia,\nwhich hospitalizes a lot of our elderly, or"},"1116":{"dur":3,"text":"immune compromise population and people die\nfrom that."},"1120":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's important to get that."},"1121":{"dur":6,"text":"The shingles vaccine is a really important\nvaccine also to get because it's for people"},"1128":{"dur":5,"text":"65 and older and they have been exposed or\nhad chicken pox."},"1133":{"dur":5,"text":"So that means that can reactivate later in\nlife when their immune system is compromised"},"1139":{"dur":3,"text":"into shingles, which is a miserable thing\nto have."},"1143":{"dur":2,"text":"So yeah, a little poke is worth it for those."},"1146":{"dur":2,"text":">>Lori Banks:Yes, I've had shingles before\nit's awful."},"1148":{"dur":1,"text":"I would not want it again."},"1150":{"dur":1,"text":"I said, \"Can I get the vaccine?\""},"1151":{"dur":4,"text":"They're like \"You've got to wait about another\n15 or 20 years.\""},"1156":{"dur":1,"text":">>Susan Hays:Exactly."},"1157":{"dur":2,"text":">>Lori Banks:What about when you're traveling\noutside of the US."},"1159":{"dur":5,"text":"I know you said in your
