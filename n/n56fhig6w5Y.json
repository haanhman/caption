But perhaps, before we begin, I"},"115":{"dur":3,"text":"really should start with what is, what I mean\nby story, because story can be used in so"},"118":{"dur":7,"text":"many different ways.

Okay, there was a fight"},"401":{"dur":7,"text":"between the two. So, what happened here. Did\nyou basically give a sequence of events. Did"},"409":{"dur":6,"text":"you say a triangle and a circle come into\na frame and they circle around the house three"},"415":{"dur":5,"text":"times and the big triangle hits them three\ntimes, or did you say that there was as struggle"},"421":{"dur":6,"text":"and a fight, and the large triangle gets angry\nat the end.

So what happened\nthere? That wasn't the complete and true sequence"},"438":{"dur":7,"text":"of events, right. So, there's something going\non there. You imposed your own emotion into"},"447":{"dur":6,"text":"very abstract shapes and forms. Now, we are\njust kind of moving around the screen, right,"},"454":{"dur":6,"text":"maybe. This was an animation that was done\nin 1944 by two psychologists from Smith College"},"460":{"dur":6,"text":"and what they were interested in is that how\nwe impose emotion onto events. So, maybe what"},"467":{"dur":7,"text":"we need to think about is that there is more\nto possibly a story then simply a sequence"},"478":{"dur":6,"text":"of events, you know. You imposed on, or you\nare a participant in this story, is that true?"},"484":{"dur":6,"text":"You are a participant. It's not so much this\nis coming at you, this happened, and then"},"490":{"dur":5,"text":"you were a part of it, right? So maybe we\nneed to change the definition then of a story"},"496":{"dur":4,"text":"to include that, and maybe saying a sequence\nof real or fictional events in which the audience"},"500":{"dur":6,"text":"imposes emotion onto the actions or onto the\ncharacters themselves. Now, this is fascinating."},"507":{"dur":5,"text":"I find this fascinating. I think this is fascinating\nright, because have you heard the term the"},"513":{"dur":6,"text":"magic of storytelling? The magic of storytelling,\nyou've probably heard that. Isn't that Disney's"},"519":{"dur":6,"text":"brand, like the magic of storytelling. The\nmagic of storytelling comes from this. It"},"525":{"dur":5,"text":"comes from the fact that it's not one direction,\nyou are bringing your own background into"},"531":{"dur":3,"text":"it, you're bringing your own emotion into\nit, so there's something going on here. So,"},"535":{"dur":3,"text":"I am going to ask you another question. I'm\njust going to keep throwing questions at you."},"538":{"dur":6,"text":"So, you remember the first two questions we\nasked? [inaudible] Yeah, why do we crave storytelling,"},"544":{"dur":5,"text":"good, [inaudible] So why do we crave story.\nSo, here's another question for you. How is"},"550":{"dur":6,"text":"this done? How are some stories, how do they,\nhow do they elicit emotion from you while"},"556":{"dur":4,"text":"other stories don't, or maybe there's a different\ndegree. Some stories elicit more emotion from"},"561":{"dur":7,"text":"you than others. Is there some sort of magic\nin this. I think that's a fascinating question,"},"568":{"dur":4,"text":"and so did this guy. This is Aristotle. Aristotle,\nmore than 2,000 years ago, thought about this."},"573":{"dur":4,"text":"He is like well, are stories magic, and if\nyou've ever studied anything that Aristotle"},"577":{"dur":7,"text":"did, he takes a categorical approach to everything,\nso he wrote this big treaties called Poetics"},"585":{"dur":5,"text":"and he basically took all of the Greek cannon\nof literature and he broke it apart, and he's"},"590":{"dur":6,"text":"like, I'm going to find out what this story,\nwhat story is. And Aristotle came up with"},"597":{"dur":5,"text":"this thing that said, you know, there are\nsix components, there is basically six components"},"602":{"dur":4,"text":"I find, right. He is saying there's plot,\ncharacter, thought, diction, melody, and spectacle,"},"607":{"dur":6,"text":"and he said this is the most important parts\nof what create a story. Now, there's a lot"},"613":{"dur":4,"text":"of things wrong by, you know, coming up with\na very categorical approach to something so"},"618":{"dur":3,"text":"magical as a story, and there's some things\nthat are wrong with this, but I kind of wanted"},"622":{"dur":5,"text":"to bring up one of his most important parts\nand he said the most important thing about"},"627":{"dur":6,"text":"his story and that's plot. But before I do\nthat, I'm going to throw another question"},"633":{"dur":7,"text":"at you, and I want you to think, do you know\nthe difference between plot and story. Do"},"642":{"dur":5,"text":"you think you know the difference between\nplot and story? Now, this is something that,"},"648":{"dur":7,"text":"you know, you might say gee, they are kind\nof similar, they are really similar, but a"},"655":{"dur":6,"text":"lot of times when I ask students this, they\nhave difficulty being able to put into words,"},"662":{"dur":4,"text":"and this is how I kind of think of it. If\nyou think of plot as things that happen to"},"666":{"dur":4,"text":"you, the character, okay, these are incidents\nthat happen to you, the character, and your"},"670":{"dur":6,"text":"story is how your character reacts. Does that\nmake sense? So, it's like plot is basically"},"677":{"dur":4,"text":"things that happen okay, and they can be outside\nthe character, they can be inside the character,"},"681":{"dur":5,"text":"but they happen to the character, and your\nstory is how your character reacts. What is"},"687":{"dur":4,"text":"that dependent upon? That depends upon the\ncharacter itself, right. So, if you think"},"692":{"dur":5,"text":"about simple plots, complex characters, this\nis something that almost all creative writers"},"698":{"dur":5,"text":"or storytellers think about. They think about\nsimple plots, complex characters because there"},"703":{"dur":7,"text":"is an infinite number of stories, but is there\nan infinite number of plots? Okay, so, - there"},"713":{"dur":5,"text":"is this guy who came up with this book, his\nname is Christopher Booker, he came up with"},"718":{"dur":7,"text":"a book, his name is Christopher Booker [chuckles]\nand he said there are 7 basic plots, and I"},"726":{"dur":6,"text":"just love when people come up with lists.\nSo I wanted to share this with you. The first"},"732":{"dur":4,"text":"one he says is overcoming the monster, and\nhe actually takes a lot of this from Aristotle"},"737":{"dur":6,"text":"and a lot of other writers who are narratologists,\nso overcoming the monster. The hero learns"},"743":{"dur":5,"text":"of a great evil threatening the land and sets\nout to destroy it. Okay, so what I want you"},"748":{"dur":4,"text":"to do now is I want you to think about a movie\nthat you've seen in the last year that follows"},"752":{"dur":6,"text":"this plot, and on the count of three, I want\nyou to just yell it out. Ready? Got it? One,"},"759":{"dur":7,"text":"two, three [inaudible comments]. So there's\na lot of movies out there, huh? There's a"},"768":{"dur":4,"text":"lot of movies out there that follow this plot,\ndo you think? I mean, this is kind of a very"},"773":{"dur":6,"text":"popular plot. Hero learns of a great evil\nthreatening the land and sets out to destroy"},"780":{"dur":5,"text":"it. A rags-to-riches, surrounded by dark forces\nhe is impressed and ridiculed on, the hero"},"785":{"dur":6,"text":"slowly blossoms into a mature figure, who\nultimately gets riches kingdom or a partner,"},"791":{"dur":7,"text":"rags-to-riches, another plot structure, quest.\nHero learns of some magical objects that he"},"799":{"dur":6,"text":"desperately wants or he needs to find, and\noften with companions. Lord of the Rings,"},"805":{"dur":7,"text":"Harry Potter, there's a lot of them, right?\nVoyage and return. Hero heads off into a magic"},"814":{"dur":4,"text":"land with crazy rules, ultimately triumphs\nover the madness and returns home far more"},"818":{"dur":5,"text":"mature then when he had left. Now, not all\nstories follow these plots, but they might"},"824":{"dur":7,"text":"have elements of each, they might have a variety\nof each, a comedy, hero and heroine are destined"},"832":{"dur":3,"text":"to get together, but a dark voice is preventing\nthem from doing so, but in the end, they triumph"},"835":{"dur":7,"text":"and love wins out. Sounds familiar? Tragedy\nis the flip-side of overcoming the monster"},"843":{"dur":3,"text":"plot or protagonist characters, the villain,\nbut we get to watch him slowly spiral down"},"847":{"dur":6,"text":"into darkness where he is finally defeated,\nfreeing the land from his evil influence."},"853":{"dur":1,"text":"Anyone watch Breaking Bad?"},"855":{"dur":1,"text":"[ Laughter ]"},"856":{"dur":7,"text":"And finally, rebirth, which is very similar\nto the tragedy, except the protagonist who"},"864":{"dur":4,"text":"is the villain finds out the error of his\nways and changes his tune before the end of"},"869":{"dur":6,"text":"the, end of the film, and he does a heel turn\nto avoid his inevitable fall. Like Despicable"},"875":{"dur":7,"text":"Me. [laughter] So, 7 basic plots, right? Okay.\nSo, what, what can we get from this? What"},"887":{"dur":4,"text":"can we get from this? I'm talking about structure\nhere, so I'm kind of digging deep into story"},"892":{"dur":4,"text":"because I want you guys to understand a little\nbit of the stricture before we do that, and"},"896":{"dur":6,"text":"I thought it would be fun to give you a--\nI thought it would be fun to give you a little"},"903":{"dur":7,"text":"bit of a case study, okay. And I thought I'd\ndo that with some Pixar films because why"},"912":{"dur":5,"text":"the heck not. Okay. So let's think about story,\nand has anyone heard of the 3-act structure?"},"917":{"dur":3,"text":"And you're like, oh God, I heard of the 3-act\nstructure. The 3-act structure, I'm going"},"921":{"dur":3,"text":"to give it to you very-- from a bird's eye\nview and then I'm going to break it down into"},"925":{"dur":6,"text":"how we set up our story. 3-act structure very\nsimple is the first act you set up your characters"},"931":{"dur":6,"text":"and you set up their task. Second is you set\nthem off on some sort of journey, some sort"},"937":{"dur":7,"text":"of adventure, where they have quests, they\ncome up with hardships, and then they come"},"944":{"dur":6,"text":"up to some sort of climax, and the third act\nis some sort of resolution in which the character"},"950":{"dur":5,"text":"finds an equilibrium that is different from\nthe first act, okay. That is basically it."},"956":{"dur":7,"text":"The first act, and you have this resolution\ngoing on. So, most stories fail as a story"},"965":{"dur":7,"text":"in the first act because the storyteller fails\nto catch you, fails to hook you, and they"},"972":{"dur":4,"text":"do this because they don't set up their story\nright. So, I'm going to use some examples"},"977":{"dur":5,"text":"from Pixar to show you how Pixar sets up their\nstory and how they hook you, how they get"},"982":{"dur":5,"text":"you to get emotional into their story, right.\nOkay. So, the first thing they do is they"},"988":{"dur":4,"text":"have to set up their character, and you set\nup your character by doing this. The first"},"993":{"dur":2,"text":"time you see the character, you've got to\nsee the character doing something that they"},"995":{"dur":6,"text":"love. What is their greatest passion? What\ndefines them as a character, okay? So, in"},"1002":{"dur":6,"text":"the case of Toy Story, we see Woody right,\nand the first time Woody comes up on the screen,"},"1009":{"dur":3,"text":"he's playing with Andy. Has everyone seen\nthis movie? This is like, like, everyone has"},"1012":{"dur":4,"text":"seen this movie, okay. So, this is his greatest\npassion, right? His greatest passion is to"},"1017":{"dur":5,"text":"be playing with Andy. This is what defines\nhim as a character, okay and that's the first"},"1023":{"dur":6,"text":"time we see him. With Finding Nemo, the first\ntime we see him is when he's moving into a"},"1029":{"dur":5,"text":"new house, and he's also expecting all of\nthese kids, so he's a family man.

What does"},"1045":{"dur":6,"text":"he love, what's his greatest passion? Fighting\ncrime. We know that, we are defining. The"},"1052":{"dur":5,"text":"next thing we have to do is we have to give\nthe character a flaw, there's a hook. The"},"1058":{"dur":5,"text":"character's flaw has to come from the character's\ngreatest passion. Okay? It has to come from"},"1064":{"dur":6,"text":"something that you just understand them to\nlove so much, right. So, in the case of Toy"},"1070":{"dur":7,"text":"Story, Woody's greatest passion is playing\nwith Andy, but he is a little bit jealous,"},"1078":{"dur":4,"text":"he doesn't want to share this with anyone,\nso he's got this sense of pride, right.

So, now we're starting, we're"},"1130":{"dur":6,"text":"developing the characters. The next thing\nthat we have to do is we need to establish"},"1136":{"dur":5,"text":"that there's trouble on the horizon. We see\nthe characters doing what they love the most,"},"1141":{"dur":4,"text":"right. And everything is wonderful for them,\nand now we have to show that there is something"},"1146":{"dur":5,"text":"on the horizon that might be problematic.\nOkay, I'm just calling this approaching storm"},"1151":{"dur":4,"text":"clouds, right. So, do you already know what\nis going on with the approaching storm clouds"},"1156":{"dur":5,"text":"for Toy Story?
