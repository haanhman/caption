year."},"35":{"dur":4,"text":"In this series called The Gift, we continue\nto examine the presents that the wise men"},"39":{"dur":1,"text":"brought Jesus."},"41":{"dur":3,"text":"Perhaps the most unusual of the three is the\nlast one."},"44":{"dur":5,"text":"We invite you to turn in your Bible to Matthew,\nchapter 2, as Skip begins the message \"The"},"50":{"dur":1,"text":"Gift of Myrrh.\""},"51":{"dur":5,"text":"Skip Heitzig: Would you turn in your Bibles,\nplease, to Matthew, chapter 2."},"57":{"dur":7,"text":"Well, it was a Christmas afternoon when the\npastor's wife fell into the couch in the living"},"65":{"dur":5,"text":"room and she said, \"Boy, am I tired.\""},"70":{"dur":5,"text":"And the pastor reeled his head around and\nhe said, \"You're tired?"},"75":{"dur":5,"text":"I did two services last night for Christmas\nEve, three services this morning on Christmas"},"81":{"dur":1,"text":"Day."},"82":{"dur":2,"text":"I've preached five times."},"84":{"dur":1,"text":"How can you be tired?\""},"85":{"dur":3,"text":"She said, \"I had to listen to every one of\nthem.\""},"89":{"dur":3,"text":"[laughter] Well, you might be feeling like\nthat about now."},"92":{"dur":7,"text":"We have been in Matthew chapter 2 verse 1\nthrough 11 for the third week in a row."},"99":{"dur":6,"text":"And we've covered individually or are covering\neach one of these gifts presented by the magi,"},"106":{"dur":6,"text":"the wise men: the gold one week, then the\nfrankincense, and then the myrrh this week."},"112":{"dur":4,"text":"But in so doing, in taking our time and going\nover it, we have learned some things."},"117":{"dur":5,"text":"It's been good to spend a little extra time\nand meditate on a familiar passage."},"122":{"dur":4,"text":"But we have learned, if you recall, that there\nweren't three of them."},"126":{"dur":6,"text":"There were three gifts presented, but there\nwas probably a large entourage of these magi,"},"133":{"dur":3,"text":"along with even a small army that would accompany\nthem."},"137":{"dur":4,"text":"Something to unnerve Herod the king and get\nhim paranoid."},"141":{"dur":5,"text":"And, as we said, three dudes on camels probably\nwouldn't have done that."},"147":{"dur":3,"text":"So there weren't three of them, there were\nprobably more."},"150":{"dur":5,"text":"The second thing we made note of is that they\nwere not kings, they were kingmakers."},"156":{"dur":1,"text":"They had come from the East."},"157":{"dur":7,"text":"They were a hereditary priesthood tribe and\nthey were in charge of acknowledging who kings"},"165":{"dur":1,"text":"would become."},"166":{"dur":4,"text":"And they were also those who would be advisors\nto the king."},"170":{"dur":3,"text":"And then the other thing that we noted is\nthat they didn't show up the day or the night"},"173":{"dur":7,"text":"that Jesus was born, but that they came sometime\nlater, as far as up to two years after his"},"181":{"dur":1,"text":"birth."},"182":{"dur":4,"text":"He was a \"young child\" at the time, and he\nwas now in a house."},"186":{"dur":3,"text":"And what that means to you personally is that\nwhen you set up your nativity set from now"},"190":{"dur":4,"text":"on, you might want to move the wise men like\nsix blocks away [laughter] if you want to"},"195":{"dur":3,"text":"be accurate, because it took them a while\nto get there."},"198":{"dur":7,"text":"But we also noted that the gifts weren't just\ncostly, expensive items that they were emblematic"},"205":{"dur":4,"text":"of roles that Jesus would play, that he would\nperform."},"210":{"dur":2,"text":"The gold was to acknowledge that he was the\nKing."},"213":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's exactly what the wise men said\nthey were looking for: \"Where is he who has"},"217":{"dur":4,"text":"been born the King of the Jews?\""},"221":{"dur":1,"text":"But then they gave him frankincense."},"222":{"dur":6,"text":"And as we noted last week, that was the substance\nthat was used by the priesthood in the temple"},"229":{"dur":2,"text":"in Jerusalem."},"231":{"dur":5,"text":"And now we consider the third gift, the gift\nof myrrh."},"237":{"dur":3,"text":"Have you ever gotten a weird gift?"},"240":{"dur":5,"text":"I remember once when I was single, and I didn't\neven know what the stuff was."},"246":{"dur":4,"text":"I worked for a doctor who for Christmas gave\nme some caviar."},"251":{"dur":3,"text":"I didn't know what that was."},"254":{"dur":5,"text":"All I know is that when I opened it up, it\nstank so bad, I thought, \"I would never touch"},"260":{"dur":2,"text":"this,\" so I gave it to my cat for Christmas."},"262":{"dur":6,"text":"[laughter] It was just a weird gift to give\na guy who had no clue."},"269":{"dur":2,"text":"I've given weird gifts before."},"272":{"dur":4,"text":"Years ago, when I was a little kid, I gave\nmy brother for Christmas his own book."},"277":{"dur":1,"text":"[laughter] He already owned it."},"278":{"dur":1,"text":"It was in his closet."},"279":{"dur":5,"text":"I just figured he really never saw it, never\nwent in there, didn't know it was there anymore."},"284":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe he had forgotten about it."},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"So I wrapped it up and I gave it to him."},"287":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, he opened it up and said, \"That's my\nbook."},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"You just gave me my book."},"294":{"dur":3,"text":"I already own what you just gave me for Christmas.\""},"298":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's weird."},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"I was reading a little Reader's Digest quip."},"304":{"dur":4,"text":"There was a young man who said he remembers\none of the strangest gifts his dad ever gave"},"308":{"dur":2,"text":"to his mom was a DVD for Christmas."},"311":{"dur":6,"text":"He said, \"Not that that's a strange gift in\nand of itself, but, number one, it was a rental.\""},"317":{"dur":1,"text":"[laughter]"},"318":{"dur":5,"text":"And he said, \"Number two, we didn't even own\na DVD player.\""},"323":{"dur":3,"text":"[laughter] So that was an odd gift."},"327":{"dur":4,"text":"And of these three gifts that are mentioned\nin verse 11 of Matthew, chapter 2, the most"},"332":{"dur":8,"text":"curious of all, perhaps even insulting to\nthe parents, was this third gift of myrrh."},"340":{"dur":9,"text":"And, yet, it is of all of them the most inspiring,\nand it shows us the depth of God's love as"},"349":{"dur":1,"text":"we consider it."},"351":{"dur":1,"text":"So let's consider it."},"352":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's go to the verses themselves once again."},"355":{"dur":5,"text":"Matthew chapter 2 verse 1, \"Now after Jesus\nwas born in Judea in the days of Herod the"},"361":{"dur":6,"text":"king, behold, wise men from the East came\nto Jerusalem, saying, 'Where is he who has"},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"been born the King of the Jews?"},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"For we have seen his star in the East and\nhave come to worship him.'"},"372":{"dur":1,"text":"\""},"373":{"dur":1,"text":"And again I take you down to verse 9."},"374":{"dur":5,"text":"\"When they heard the king,\" Herod, who claimed\nhe wanted to worship him too, \"they departed;"},"379":{"dur":5,"text":"and behold, the star which they had seen in\nthe East went before them, until it came and"},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"stood over where the young Child was."},"389":{"dur":6,"text":"And when they saw the star, they rejoiced\nwith exceedingly great joy."},"395":{"dur":4,"text":"And when they had come into the house, they\nsaw the young Child with Mary his mother,"},"400":{"dur":1,"text":"and fell down and worshiped him."},"402":{"dur":8,"text":"And when they had opened their treasures,\nthey presented gifts to him: gold, frankincense,"},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"and myrrh.\""},"413":{"dur":7,"text":"First what I'd like to do with you is consider\nthis gift of myrrh in its significance in"},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"ancient history."},"422":{"dur":7,"text":"The use of myrrh goes all the way back to\nthe second millennia BC."},"429":{"dur":5,"text":"One source I read said as far back as the\nsixth millennium BC."},"435":{"dur":1,"text":"That's the Neolithic Period."},"437":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's an ancient item and it was used long\nago."},"442":{"dur":1,"text":"What is it exactly?"},"443":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, myrrh was, like frankincense, a resin\nthat came from a tree or a plant."},"449":{"dur":8,"text":"It was an aromatic resin that came from a\nreddish gum from a low-lying, low-growing,"},"458":{"dur":3,"text":"thorny tree in that part of the world."},"461":{"dur":6,"text":"The exudate from the branches of that tree,\nthe substance that came out of it yielded"},"467":{"dur":3,"text":"a very pleasant smell and hardened into a\nresin."},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"That was myrrh."},"474":{"dur":5,"text":"If you were to look it up in your Bible, you\nwould discover the word \"myrrh\" appears seventeen"},"480":{"dur":1,"text":"times."},"481":{"dur":4,"text":"At least in my version of the Bible, the one\nI looked it up in, seventeen times \"myrrh\""},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"appears."},"487":{"dur":5,"text":"Fourteen of those are in the Old Testament;\nthree of them are in the New Testament."},"492":{"dur":4,"text":"The Hebrew word sounds like the English word:\nmor."},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"It's called in Hebrew \"mor,\" in English \"myrrh.\""},"501":{"dur":5,"text":"But the word that is used in the text that\nyou and I are reading is a Greek word."},"506":{"dur":4,"text":"And as I tell you the word, it should ring\na bell if you have been a Bible student at"},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"all and you've read your New Testament."},"514":{"dur":4,"text":"It's the word smurna, smurna."},"518":{"dur":1,"text":"Now there was a city called Smyrna."},"520":{"dur":6,"text":"And if you've read Revelation 2, it was the\nsecond of the seven churches that Jesus wrote"},"527":{"dur":7,"text":"little postcards to: \"To the angel of the\nchurch of Smyrna.\""},"534":{"dur":5,"text":"Smyrna was thirty miles north of Ephesus in\nAsia Minor."},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"It's modern Izmir, Turkey."},"542":{"dur":7,"text":"And for modern history, it was the place where\nAristotle Onassis who married Jacqueline Kennedy,"},"549":{"dur":3,"text":"and she became Onassis, that's where he was\nfrom."},"553":{"dur":7,"text":"But because it was this commercial port, and\nthe chief export of that city was myrrh, they"},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"called it after the substance, smurna."},"564":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's the word that is used here."},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"It was used several different ways in ancient\ntimes."},"570":{"dur":6,"text":"First of all, it was used, women, as a beauty\ntreatment."},"576":{"dur":5,"text":"When Esther, before she even became queen,\nwas brought in before the king in Esther,"},"581":{"dur":7,"text":"chapter 2, we read this: \"Each young woman's\nturn came to go into King Ahasuerus after"},"589":{"dur":8,"text":"she had completed twelve months' preparation\"---here\nit is---\"six months with oil of myrrh, and"},"597":{"dur":5,"text":"six months with perfumes and preparations\nfor beautifying women.\""},"602":{"dur":6,"text":"So it was like the ultimate spa experience,\n[laughter] and it lasted a year."},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"How's that for a treatment, six months with\nmyrrh?"},"612":{"dur":3,"text":"So, it was a beauty product."},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"Second usage in the Bible: it was a perfume."},"618":{"dur":8,"text":"Psalm 45 notes that the king's garments are,\nquote, \"scented with myrrh and aloes and cassia.\""},"627":{"dur":6,"text":"Some of you remember Proverbs 7 where the\nseductress says to the young man, \"I have"},"633":{"dur":5,"text":"perfumed my bed with myrrh and aloes and cinnamon.\""},"639":{"dur":7,"text":"And then I love the Song of Solomon where\nSolomon the groom says to his fianc\u00e9e as"},"647":{"dur":6,"text":"she rides in toward him, \"Who is this coming\nout of the wilderness like pillars of smoke,"},"654":{"dur":5,"text":"perfumed with myrrh . . . .\" So it was a beautifying\ntreatment, a spa treatment."},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"It was used as a perfume."},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"The third usage: it was an analgesic."},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"It was a painkiller."},"667":{"dur":1,"text":"It took away the pain."},"668":{"dur":5,"text":"By the way, it is still recommended in certain\nparts of the world for toothaches and for"},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"sprains and minor aches and pains."},"676":{"dur":1,"text":"It was used in the Bible that way."},"678":{"dur":8,"text":"In Mark 15 we're told, \"They gave [Jesus]\nwine mingled with myrrh to drink, but he did"},"686":{"dur":1,"text":"not take it.\""},"687":{"dur":6,"text":"When Jesus was on the cross and he was dying\nthe most excruciating death of crucifixion,"},"693":{"dur":4,"text":"the Romans offered him wine and myrrh to deaden\nthe pain."},"698":{"dur":4,"text":"What I find fascinating is Jesus refused it."},"702":{"dur":7,"text":"It's as if he saw the importance, as the substitute\ntaking on him the sin of the world, to feel"},"709":{"dur":6,"text":"every single ounce of pain and he refused\nto have that pain deadened."},"716":{"dur":3,"text":"A fourth use is a modern use: as an antiseptic."},"719":{"dur":7,"text":"Again, in many parts of the world it's used\nin mouthwashes, in toothpaste, and they say"},"727":{"dur":3,"text":"it even prevents gum disease."},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"So there you have it."},"732":{"dur":6,"text":"But the fifth usage is important and germane\nto this text."},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"It was used as an embalming fluid."},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"It was used to treat the dead."},"744":{"dur":4,"text":"And I have quoted in this little miniseries\nHerodotus a lot, that ancient Greek historian,"},"748":{"dur":4,"text":"because I draw a lot of this stuff from him\nbecause of his record of it."},"753":{"dur":4,"text":"He says that it was used mostly for treating\nthe dead."},"757":{"dur":6,"text":"The Egyptians used it to embalm the inside\nof the body cavity before it was entombed."},"764":{"dur":8,"text":"But not only them, the Jews also used myrrh\nto treat the outside of the body, and we find"},"772":{"dur":1,"text":"that in the case of Jesus Christ."},"774":{"dur":7,"text":"After he died, at his burial in John, chapter\n19, the Bible said, \"And Nicodemus, who at"},"781":{"dur":7,"text":"first came to Jesus by night, also came, bringing\na mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred"},"788":{"dur":1,"text":"pounds.\""},"789":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, the reason they used it was for obvious\nreasons."},"793":{"dur":6,"text":"Because bodies, once they corrupt, stink,\nand to mitigate against the stench of that"},"799":{"dur":4,"text":"tomb experience, myrrh and aloes were used\nto encase the body."},"804":{"dur":8,"text":"Here's what's interesting: the same substance\nthat was associated with Jesus' early life"},"813":{"dur":3,"text":"is also associated with the end of Jesus'\nlife."},"816":{"dur":6,"text":"Myrrh was presented to him after his birth;\nmyrrh is presented to him and used for him"},"823":{"dur":2,"text":"at his death."},"825":{"dur":7,"text":"Now why this is fascinating is because I discovered\nthat the ancient rabbis associated myrrh with"},"833":{"dur":2,"text":"sacrificial death."},"836":{"dur":3,"text":"And I just discovered this, but it's fascinating\nto me."},"839":{"dur":7,"text":"Rabbis associated myrrh with sacrificial death,\nand especially Abraham giving his son Isaac"},"847":{"dur":1,"text":"on Mount Moriah."},"849":{"dur":6,"text":"And here is why: the Hebrew word for \"myrrh\"\nis the world mor, and that is the root word"},"855":{"dur":8,"text":"of the place where Abraham almost sacrificed\nIsaac, on Mount Moriah the \"mountain of myrrh.\""},"863":{"dur":9,"text":"So, to an ancient Hebrew rabbi \"myrrh\" immediately\nconnected with death, and especially the sacrifice"},"873":{"dur":2,"text":"of a father of his son."},"876":{"dur":6,"text":"Now, this really got my attention, because\nin that same area, Mount Moriah, is where"},"882":{"dur":6,"text":"Jesus Christ would be sacrificed by his Father\nfor the sins of the world years later."},"889":{"dur":8,"text":"No wonder, then, that ancient Christian scholars\nregard this gift of myrrh to the child Jesus"},"897":{"dur":2,"text":"as prophetic of his death."},"899":{"dur":7,"text":"Okay, so now imagine that you're Joseph or\nMary and these people knock at your door one"},"906":{"dur":1,"text":"day."},"907":{"dur":3,"text":"You get a knock at the door, and you open\nthe door, and it's like a whole army of people"},"911":{"dur":1,"text":"from the East."},"913":{"dur":4,"text":"And everybody in town's going, \"Wha-whaat!?\"\nand \"Why are they at your house?\""},"917":{"dur":3,"text":"And then they say, \"Well, we have some gifts\nfor you,\" and they give you gold, and you're"},"920":{"dur":1,"text":"just almost embarrassed."},"922":{"dur":1,"text":"It's too much."},"923":{"dur":4,"text":"You've never seen that kind of a gift, but\nyou receive it graciously."},"927":{"dur":1,"text":"Then they give the frankincense."},"929":{"dur":4,"text":"And you understand, being that Jewish male\nor female, that that's associated with the"},"933":{"dur":1,"text":"priesthood."},"934":{"dur":10,"text":"But then they pull out the last gift and you\ndon't know to say: \"Oh, embalming fluid."},"944":{"dur":2,"text":"How lovely."},"947":{"dur":2,"text":"Thank you.\""},"950":{"dur":5,"text":"Because you know that at that time in your\nown life it had been used as a beauty treatment"},"956":{"dur":4,"text":"as all these other ways, but now is principally\nused to treat the dead."},"961":{"dur":4,"text":"Have you ever been given a gift that bombs\nat Christmas?"},"965":{"dur":1,"text":"My parents would give, like, underwear."},"967":{"dur":1,"text":"They'd wrap it up."},"968":{"dur":1,"text":"I go, \"Why?"},"969":{"dur":1,"text":"Why
