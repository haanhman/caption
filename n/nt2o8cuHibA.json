{"3":{"dur":3,"text":"- So we know that starting a company"},"6":{"dur":1,"text":"or being involved with a start-up"},"8":{"dur":2,"text":"is full of surprises and often"},"11":{"dur":4,"text":"pits that you fall into, as well as really fabulous highs."},"16":{"dur":3,"text":"Have there been already some surprises"},"19":{"dur":1,"text":"that you could share with us?"},"21":{"dur":1,"text":"Obviously you started with the idea"},"22":{"dur":2,"text":"that okay, this is gonna be fabulous and great,"},"25":{"dur":2,"text":"but what happened that might have"},"27":{"dur":1,"text":"surprised you along the way?"},"28":{"dur":1,"text":"Cody, do you want to start?"},"30":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, for us, we're surprised that,"},"31":{"dur":2,"text":"so we built a training tool for professional athletes"},"33":{"dur":2,"text":"to use VR to train, and we're always surprised"},"36":{"dur":2,"text":"that coaches don't want to use the tool."},"38":{"dur":2,"text":"I think the biggest surprise for me is"},"41":{"dur":2,"text":"how important sales is to our cycle,"},"43":{"dur":2,"text":"is to actually try to sell this tool,"},"46":{"dur":2,"text":"because to us we are a company of athletes"},"48":{"dur":3,"text":"and sports-minded folk, but the sales process"},"52":{"dur":2,"text":"is so important to the industry,"},"55":{"dur":1,"text":"and I think the biggest surprise was just"},"56":{"dur":2,"text":"how hard we need to work at that."},"59":{"dur":2,"text":"So instead of proving it as a tool,"},"61":{"dur":2,"text":"it's always about pitching it to kind of,"},"63":{"dur":4,"text":"how do they use it in a way that is effective for them,"},"69":{"dur":2,"text":"and how do we pitch it to them as something that's gonna be"},"71":{"dur":3,"text":"non-invasive to their current coaching philosophies."},"74":{"dur":1,"text":"- Interesting, you sort of thought,"},"75":{"dur":1,"text":"if we built it, they will come."},"77":{"dur":1,"text":"- Exactly.\n- And you learned"},"78":{"dur":1,"text":"that that was certainly not the case."},"80":{"dur":2,"text":"- It's not the case yeah, so we're still working on that."},"82":{"dur":1,"text":"- Great, Elaine?"},"84":{"dur":0,"text":"- Thanks."},"85":{"dur":4,"text":"I think generally speaking, the genomics industry"},"89":{"dur":2,"text":"and the technology that's been developing over the last"},"92":{"dur":2,"text":"decade has been moving extraordinarily quickly."},"94":{"dur":2,"text":"The cost per sequencing a base pair"},"97":{"dur":3,"text":"is dropping much much faster than Moore's Law,"},"101":{"dur":4,"text":"exponentially faster, in fact, and so it's really enabled"},"105":{"dur":3,"text":"this technology to be applied in a clinical setting"},"108":{"dur":2,"text":"now very rapidly, so I think at a meta level"},"110":{"dur":1,"text":"that's been a surprise to all of us"},"112":{"dur":2,"text":"in terms of how quickly that technology has developed."},"115":{"dur":1,"text":"But I think for us at the start-up,"},"117":{"dur":1,"text":"we're a very mission-driven company,"},"119":{"dur":2,"text":"and so the rate at which we've been growing,"},"121":{"dur":4,"text":"we have a company value of GSD, which is Get Stuff Done."},"127":{"dur":2,"text":"It's just been a phenomenal experience"},"130":{"dur":2,"text":"over the last several months to see how much a group"},"133":{"dur":2,"text":"of really smart, like-minded, mission-driven folks"},"136":{"dur":2,"text":"can get done, and so as an example,"},"138":{"dur":2,"text":"we brought in our first wave of hires in March"},"141":{"dur":2,"text":"and by August we had already started"},"143":{"dur":2,"text":"enrolling in our first clinical trial,"},"146":{"dur":3,"text":"which will end up enrolling over 10,000 subjects."},"149":{"dur":2,"text":"And just the pace at which that has happened"},"152":{"dur":3,"text":"is pretty unprecedented in the oncology space."},"156":{"dur":3,"text":"And so that's been a very pleasing surprise for all of us."},"159":{"dur":3,"text":"- [Woman On Left] Great, so a good surprise."},"163":{"dur":3,"text":"- Yeah, I think for me, the big surprise was"},"167":{"dur":2,"text":"when we were first starting this and kind of"},"169":{"dur":2,"text":"working in the evenings, figuring things out,"},"172":{"dur":2,"text":"I sort of naively thought that, oh,"},"175":{"dur":2,"text":"we're three Stanford students,"},"177":{"dur":3,"text":"we have two technical founders and one business co-founder,"},"181":{"dur":3,"text":"and someone will give us an initial amount of money"},"184":{"dur":1,"text":"to get out there and get going,"},"186":{"dur":3,"text":"and then the later stage funding would be the hard part,"},"189":{"dur":2,"text":"the first funding would be really easy."},"192":{"dur":2,"text":"And that turned out to not be the case at all."},"194":{"dur":2,"text":"No one really wanted to give us any money 'cause we had"},"196":{"dur":4,"text":"no prototype, we just had an idea and had a decent story."},"201":{"dur":3,"text":"So what we had to do was end up getting government"},"204":{"dur":2,"text":"funding to build our initial prototype,"},"206":{"dur":2,"text":"and in general we've had to diversify"},"208":{"dur":1,"text":"the streams in which we've raised money."},"210":{"dur":2,"text":"So we've also looked at philanthropy and family offices"},"213":{"dur":2,"text":"and kind of to get us to the stage"},"216":{"dur":2,"text":"where we would be attractive to venture funding"},"218":{"dur":2,"text":"at a later point, we're still not there yet."},"220":{"dur":2,"text":"We're bringing in angel investors and that type of thing,"},"223":{"dur":2,"text":"but we're not quite ready for the venture capital funding."},"226":{"dur":1,"text":"And so that has been the most surprising part,"},"228":{"dur":1,"text":"you hear all these stories about, oh,"},"230":{"dur":2,"text":"a couple students got their initial seed funding"},"232":{"dur":2,"text":"right out of school and then could take off."},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"For a clean tech company, and doing hardware,"},"237":{"dur":1,"text":"that's not the case."},"241":{"dur":3,"text":"- So, I was surprised by how many people"},"244":{"dur":2,"text":"will tell you that you can't do it."},"247":{"dur":3,"text":"When I started Bright, so, I wasn't fluent in Spanish,"},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"I still am not, and our first market is Mexico."},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"So there were some things that just didn't make sense,"},"255":{"dur":2,"text":"and I knew that, but I also was very surprised"},"258":{"dur":2,"text":"that so many people said, that just doesn't make sense,"},"260":{"dur":2,"text":"you can't start in a country you've never been to"},"263":{"dur":1,"text":"that you have no connections to,"},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"and you can't speak the language."},"267":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was like, the nos, and, what are you doing,"},"270":{"dur":2,"text":"you're crazy, would come from everywhere."},"272":{"dur":2,"text":"I think there was maybe 5% of the people I talked to"},"275":{"dur":3,"text":"that were really supportive, and like, this is a great idea."},"278":{"dur":2,"text":"But it's kind of like, I don't know if anyone,"},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"who here has signed up for a race"},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"that they thought was a crazy race,"},"285":{"dur":3,"text":"but then because they signed up, they just did it?"},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"That's how it works, and it's kind of the same"},"290":{"dur":1,"text":"with entrepreneurship and start-ups."},"292":{"dur":3,"text":"You kind of just have to sign up, make the leap,"},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"and then on the opposite side of the coin,"},"298":{"dur":1,"text":"I was surprised by how much you can"},"299":{"dur":1,"text":"figure out if you just do that."},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"Actually, I flew to Mexico for the first time"},"304":{"dur":1,"text":"when I was starting Bright,"},"306":{"dur":1,"text":"and the power of the Stanford network,"},"308":{"dur":2,"text":"I reached out to Stanford alumni in Mexico,"},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"and someone I had never met, I ended up staying with,"},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"and my flight was late, so I ended up"},"315":{"dur":1,"text":"getting there at midnight, he was asleep."},"317":{"dur":1,"text":"It was a very awkward interaction when I was blowing up"},"319":{"dur":2,"text":"the air mattress to sleep on his floor."},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's, it's a crazy start,"},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"but that was my first connection in Mexico,"},"325":{"dur":1,"text":"and then it just grew from there."},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"And yeah, it was crazy and it didn't make any sense."},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"But kind of signing up for it is the most important step"},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"that you can take, and you'll test your limits,"},"335":{"dur":1,"text":"but you will succeed far more"},"337":{"dur":1,"text":"than you think you're capable of,"},"339":{"dur":3,"text":"and it will only happen if you sign up."}}
