There's an artist in every family throughout the world."},"12":{"dur":4,"text":"Lot's of times there's an artist deep down inside all of us as well."},"16":{"dur":4,"text":"So grab your kids, your brothers, your sisters, your aunties,"},"20":{"dur":4,"text":"uncles, and mums and dads and come and see how some of the best artists"},"24":{"dur":4,"text":"in Australia do what they do."},"28":{"dur":32,"text":"(Music Plays)"},"60":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] Well hi viewers and welcome"},"64":{"dur":4,"text":"back to Colour In Your Life. We're in Sydney today with a very talented"},"68":{"dur":4,"text":"mixed media artist: Shazia Imran. [Shazia] Hi. Nice to meet you. [Graeme] Welcome to the show darling."},"72":{"dur":4,"text":"How are you? [Shazia] Thank you. [Graeme] Excellent.  Shazia is an award winning artist,"},"76":{"dur":4,"text":"and is really multi disciplined in a lot of the things that she does. She does"},"80":{"dur":4,"text":"watercolors, acrylics, sculpture as well. It's a bit of a"},"84":{"dur":4,"text":"fantastic journey that she's been on. Exhibited in New York, [Shazia] New York, yeah."},"88":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] Florence as well. [Shazia] Yeah. [Graeme] Coming up to the BNL, is that correct? [Shazia] Yeah. [Graeme] Fantastic."},"92":{"dur":4,"text":"And her work is really vibrant, it's just amazing to watch."},"96":{"dur":4,"text":"When you originally started, I mean you're from a Pakistani background, and"},"100":{"dur":4,"text":"you said to your dad, who is a lawyer, that you wanted to be an artist."},"104":{"dur":4,"text":"What was his response to that? [Shazia] Oh it was expected in"},"108":{"dur":4,"text":"the beginning. Like he was shocked a bit - and he was like oh, you want to become an artist."},"112":{"dur":4,"text":"And but then eventually came by, because a lot of my family members, they"},"116":{"dur":4,"text":"engineers, doctors and, you know. [Graeme] Academics. [Shazia] Yeah."},"120":{"dur":4,"text":"So being an artist was kind of a new thing for them, but"},"124":{"dur":4,"text":"now he's a big supporter of me. [Graeme] That's great. It's fantastic and I think obviously our"},"128":{"dur":4,"text":"parents are a great deal of the influence that we have in our lives as well. [Shazia] Yeah, definitely."},"132":{"dur":4,"text":"[ Graeme] Without a doubt. But you're ah, a lot of the stiff that you've been doing recently is"},"136":{"dur":4,"text":"as you can see is really themed on buildings, and New York. Which is fascinating"},"140":{"dur":4,"text":"city under any circumstances. [Shazia] Yep. [Graeme] It's an amazing place. But we're going to be"},"144":{"dur":4,"text":"doing one of your mixed media pieces today. [Shazia] Yep. [Graeme] And obviously"},"148":{"dur":4,"text":"you got tissue paper down here already. [Shazia] Yep. So I would like to work in layers."},"152":{"dur":4,"text":"Like my last body of work is more like mixed media stuff,"},"156":{"dur":4,"text":"and I like to layer upon layer."},"160":{"dur":4,"text":"And which will involve some collage, some mixed media, some other"},"164":{"dur":4,"text":"acrylics, and any other material I can get to. So yeah, I try to"},"168":{"dur":4,"text":"add on to it. [Graeme] Alright, what I'll do is step out, it's a good place for me to be these days."},"172":{"dur":4,"text":"And I'm going to let you do what you've got to do, and I'm just going to ask you some questions during the day"},"176":{"dur":4,"text":"so that we can go through. And then we're going to show obviously a lot of shots of what Shazia"},"180":{"dur":4,"text":"has been doing with her career, which is some really special stuff. But I'm going to get out of here"},"184":{"dur":4,"text":"and I'm going to let you do what you need to do. [Shazia] Thank you. [Graeme] Excellent."},"204":{"dur":4,"text":"[Shazia] Okay, so first of all whenever I start my art work,"},"208":{"dur":4,"text":"I will actually have a rough plan in my mind of what I would like to do"},"212":{"dur":4,"text":"eventually, although mixed media is quite fluid. And"},"216":{"dur":4,"text":"as I like to do layers, it can"},"220":{"dur":4,"text":"go anywhere. But you know, to have a bit of a plan is good. I always"},"224":{"dur":4,"text":"like to use some textures, this is a also a form of tissue paper, but"},"228":{"dur":4,"text":"you know it's a bit patterned, [Graeme] Yeah. [Shazia] so I'll use a bit of that."},"232":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] So the art stores sell numerous quantities of these? [Shazia] Yes."},"236":{"dur":4,"text":"Yes. If you go to the art stores you can get different materials, you can get a"},"240":{"dur":4,"text":"like you know, printed ones, [Graeme] Yeah. [Shazia]  you can get plain ones, you can get"},"244":{"dur":4,"text":"a lot of you know, sort of patterned ones as"},"248":{"dur":4,"text":"well. [Graeme] Yes. [Shazia] One thing I usually do sometimes is I actually put"},"252":{"dur":4,"text":"for my older collage pieces there and I'll actually paste it with a"},"256":{"dur":4,"text":"masking tape, just to see the composition from the back before I"},"260":{"dur":4,"text":"paste it. Usually I would like to use some shapes."},"264":{"dur":4,"text":"Like in this instance I'm use U shape, or"},"268":{"dur":4,"text":"S, which is quite popular in sculptures as well."},"272":{"dur":4,"text":"or Z, the letter Z, so If I'm planning something"},"276":{"dur":4,"text":"I will actually start with something which is more familiar to people. And now"},"280":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm using binder, just normal binder and then just"},"284":{"dur":4,"text":"paste it there. [Graeme] Okay. [Shazia] If the paper is really thick then"},"288":{"dur":4,"text":"I'll just soak it before I'm pasting it on that"},"292":{"dur":4,"text":"canvas. And"},"296":{"dur":4,"text":"just let it with a little bit on top as well so it just grabs. [Graeme] So"},"300":{"dur":4,"text":"its wet and soaks through. [Shazia] Yeah. When I look at your Academic"},"304":{"dur":4,"text":"situation, you've really done a lot of things as far as design's concerned. You've"},"308":{"dur":4,"text":"got a post graduate degree, Masters of Design, Digital Media from"},"312":{"dur":4,"text":"the University of Western Sydney. You've got a Bachelors Degree with Distinction, National Collage of"},"316":{"dur":4,"text":"Arts. You weren't mucking around when you wanted to do this as a career were you?"},"320":{"dur":4,"text":"[Shazia] No. I think I was in creative"},"324":{"dur":4,"text":"business anyway, right from the start . So"},"328":{"dur":4,"text":"I graduated with Design, but paintings I was doing"},"332":{"dur":4,"text":"on and off all the time. First as a hobby, but now"},"336":{"dur":4,"text":"now for last five or six years I'm taking it really seriously. [Graeme] Yeah. [Shazia] And I think"},"340":{"dur":4,"text":"yeah, I'm getting a really good response from that side. [Graeme] But"},"344":{"dur":4,"text":"the fact that you have been willing to go out and do a lot of workshops,"},"348":{"dur":4,"text":"find out the information. You know, work with people like Phillipe"},"352":{"dur":4,"text":"Faraut from New York who's a terrific sculptor over there. [Shazia] Yeah."},"356":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] Which has obviously influenced in your sculpture work. And a good  friend of ours"},"360":{"dur":4,"text":"we know him quiet well, Alvaro Castagnet. [Shazia] Yep. [Graeme] You've done some work with Alvaro."},"364":{"dur":4,"text":"He's a fantastic artist and a teacher as well. [Shazia] Yeah, amazing, amazing artist."},"368":{"dur":4,"text":"Its always like, I love learning [Graeme] Yeah. [Shazia] And so I"},"372":{"dur":4,"text":"try to join the demos and workshops and whatever I can get to,"},"376":{"dur":4,"text":"because you get inspired from looking at other artists work as well."},"380":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] Yes. [Shazia] And then you can do your own. Okay, so"},"384":{"dur":4,"text":"why it's drying, I'll try"},"388":{"dur":4,"text":"to mix some colors which I'm going to use on that. [Graeme] And you're using"},"392":{"dur":4,"text":"acrylics? [Shazia] Yeah, today I'm using acrylics. Because of this I'm"},"396":{"dur":4,"text":"using canvas today, so I'm going to use acrylics. But if I'm working on"},"400":{"dur":4,"text":"paper I will actually sometimes use gouache and watercolor as well,"},"404":{"dur":4,"text":"and then I will try to build up layer by layer. What I'm going to do"},"408":{"dur":4,"text":"is I'm going to mix some colors in there."},"412":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay, so now I'm going to break these colors down in washes,"},"416":{"dur":4,"text":"and use larger brushes, so one for each color."},"420":{"dur":4,"text":"Just mix it. [Graeme] Nice big Hake brush. That's a fantastic"},"424":{"dur":4,"text":"vivid blue isn't it? [Shazia] Yeah. I like to use Phthalo Blue, and I like to use"},"428":{"dur":4,"text":"to use three different brushes, because then I can actually keep them with the color."},"432":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] So what do you thinks you're main source of inspiration with your work?"},"436":{"dur":4,"text":"[Shazia] Look, I get inspired by anything around me. My latest work is basically"},"440":{"dur":4,"text":"based on a lot of buildings. That's because I traveled to New York and"},"444":{"dur":4,"text":"Europe, and I got inspired by those countries, cities"},"448":{"dur":4,"text":"a lot. [Graeme] Yes. [Shazia] So the latest body of work is based on that. But I can"},"452":{"dur":4,"text":"get inspiration from anything basically. [Graeme] Yes. Your, as I said before a"},"456":{"dur":4,"text":"multi disciplined artist. [Shazia] So what I'm going to do now,"},"460":{"dur":4,"text":"is just roughly, sometimes it's good to actually"},"464":{"dur":4,"text":"be, have a free-flow effect. [Graeme] Yes. [Shazia] So"},"468":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm just going to apply this Magenta."},"472":{"dur":4,"text":"And a little bit of purple."},"476":{"dur":4,"text":"And which as I'm following the same shape, U shape which I've created"},"480":{"dur":4,"text":"did with my collage as well.  Okay."},"484":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] And that fantastic Phthalo Blue. [Shazia] Yeah, oh look at that."},"488":{"dur":4,"text":"It's lovely."},"492":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay, so. [Graeme] Okay."},"496":{"dur":4,"text":"[Shazia] I'm going to pour it all on the canvas."},"500":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] There's a girl that's not afraid."},"504":{"dur":4,"text":"[Shazia] And sometimes it always good to use different sorts of"},"508":{"dur":4,"text":"techniques and you know, materials with that."},"512":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] So you've got an atomiser there. [Shazia] Yep. And that's a fine"},"516":{"dur":4,"text":"mist spray. [Graeme] And I suppose the material underneath"},"520":{"dur":4,"text":"will grab certain sections, and soak that and make it either darker or lighter"},"524":{"dur":4,"text":"in areas. [Shazia] And if you want to keep it a bit more transparent,"},"528":{"dur":4,"text":"then it's always good to add a bit of water. [Graeme] So you got"},"532":{"dur":4,"text":"sponge roller there. [Shazia] Yes. [Graeme] That's pretty cool. [Shazia] Yeah, it's easy to"},"536":{"dur":4,"text":"let the run with that. Also sometimes it's always good to actually"},"540":{"dur":4,"text":"use just normal"},"544":{"dur":4,"text":"items around you, for example tissue paper - it's really handy."},"548":{"dur":4,"text":"It creates really lovely texture. [Graeme] Yeah, different patterns everywhere."},"552":{"dur":4,"text":"[Shazia] Yeah. And a few more, did it again."},"556":{"dur":4,"text":"Just like this. [Graeme] Watch it run."},"560":{"dur":4,"text":"[Shazia] Yeah. So that way I'm getting a lot of shapes which"},"564":{"dur":4,"text":"I won't be able to if I'm actually drawing them. [Graeme] Yeah."},"568":{"dur":4,"text":"[Shazia] So basically I'm preparing a surface for my drawing, [Graeme] Yeah."},"572":{"dur":4,"text":"[Shazia] which I'm going to do later. Okay, we've put some color on the canvas,"},"576":{"dur":4,"text":"and I'm going to put it away because it's going to take time to dry."},"580":{"dur":4,"text":"Mean while, I have prepared another one which is almost similar"},"584":{"dur":4,"text":"in color scheme. Graeme, if you don't mind [Graeme] Sure. No problem. [Shazia] can you [Graeme] There you go."},"588":{"dur":4,"text":"hand to me? [Shazia] Thank you very much. [Graeme] And I'll grab this one and put it down flat somewhere for you. [Shazia] Thank you."},"592":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] There you go."},"612":{"dur":4,"text":"[Shazia] So now that we have prepared this one, I'm"},"616":{"dur":4,"text":"going to draw on that. I like to use charcoal because it's easily,"},"620":{"dur":4,"text":"you can rub it if you make a any mistake. And once I"},"624":{"dur":4,"text":"finalise, then I'll use some of the crayon or something."},"628":{"dur":4,"text":"So just drawing it roughly. [Graeme] I suppose life figurative classes would help"},"632":{"dur":4,"text":"you in understanding the human form? [Shazia] Yeah, definitely."},"636":{"dur":4,"text":"After doing sculpture, it helps a lot understanding the human figure."},"640":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] And you've done some fantastic sculptures too. You've got one there called Sophie, which is a"},"644":{"dur":4,"text":"an upstanding nude [Shazia] Yeah. [Graeme] with her hands in the air. [Graeme] That's beautiful. [Shazia] Thank you."},"648":{"dur":4,"text":"So that one is cast in bronze. [Graeme] You've got another one there as well"},"652":{"dur":4,"text":"which is really interesting because, you actually made this out of your head, which I think"},"656":{"dur":4,"text":"is pretty hard. It's Karam-un-nisa  [Shazia] Yes. [Graeme] Which is"},"660":{"dur":4,"text":"fantastic. You said you reminded you of your grandmother. [Shazia] Yes. I actually"},"664":{"dur":4,"text":"started working on it, and when I finished it I thought"},"668":{"dur":4,"text":"well that looks like my grandmother now. So I named her after that. Alright, so I'm going to"},"672":{"dur":4,"text":"this white charcoal or conte, whatever you have,"},"676":{"dur":4,"text":"just to capture some highlights. So in this"},"680":{"dur":4,"text":"light is coming from that side, [Graeme] Yeah. [Shazia] so it will blend in [Graeme] Yep."},"684":{"dur":4,"text":"[Shazia] later with a lot of the other materials we are going to use. Okay, so"},"688":{"dur":4,"text":"we just adding the highlighted areas now."},"692":{"dur":4,"text":"And then we'll move onto"},"696":{"dur":4,"text":"the acrylics. Another thing I'm going to do now, is I'm"},"700":{"dur":4,"text":"going to think about adding a bit more of pattern in this painting."},"704":{"dur":4,"text":"So what I'm doing now is just looking at"},"708":{"dur":4,"text":"that if these pieces are going to look fine on this"},"712":{"dur":4,"text":"painting or not. And a good way to do it"},"716":{"dur":4,"text":"is just to stick it with masking tape, and then step back,"},"720":{"dur":4,"text":"take a look, and then change it if you don't like it."},"724":{"dur":4,"text":"And sometimes I would actually overlap this texture, so that"},"728":{"dur":4,"text":"you know, it blends in with the figure. So I'm going to move it now"},"732":{"dur":4,"text":"and use my binder again, [Graeme] Yes."},"736":{"dur":4,"text":"[Shazia] to just stick these pieces. And I usually"},"740":{"dur":4,"text":"go with binder on top of that as well, just to preserve the design."},"744":{"dur":4,"text":"Sometimes I would look at a painting and I would layer it with another layer of"},"748":{"dur":4,"text":"tissue papers, so I will do that right now. [Graeme] Okay."},"752":{"dur":4,"text":"You're sort of really building a story here. [Shazia] Yes. Layer by layer. And"},"756":{"dur":4,"text":"then we add another dimension to it. [Graeme] Yeah. [Shazia] And I will"},"760":{"dur":4,"text":"looking at the shapes being created on this piece as well. So not"},"764":{"dur":4,"text":"from the whole figurative point of view, but you know, small little shapes which are"},"768":{"dur":4,"text":"being created. And then those lines which adds to the movement"},"772":{"dur":4,"text":"of the painting. And brushes I use normally for this sort of work"},"776":{"dur":4,"text":"is like, you know, cheap brushes, and then I have other brushes for other"},"780":{"dur":4,"text":"work. So now we have put on another layer of tissue papers on that. So now"},"784":{"dur":4,"text":"and it has dried a bit, so now we are ready to paint."},"788":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] Excellent. [Shazia] So I'm going to move that on the easel"},"792":{"dur":4,"text":"so I can see clearly. Again I'm going to stick to my"},"796":{"dur":4,"text":"three colours, main colors. I'll use Phthalo Blue as my"},"800":{"dur":4,"text":"darks. And for medium I'll using this brilliant"},"804":{"dur":4,"text":"Magenta, and for highlights I'm going to stick to"},"808":{"dur":4,"text":"Naples Yellow. [Graeme] There's really no whites or darks. You just"},"812":{"dur":4,"text":"simply using pure color all the way through. [Shazia] Yep. I'll probably start with my middle"},"816":{"dur":4,"text":"tone first. [Graeme] Okay. Bold."},"820":{"dur":4,"text":"[Shazia] Yeah and I'll blend it in later. At this point I can"},"824":{"dur":4,"text":"actually use a little bit of spay as well. So just to"},"828":{"dur":4,"text":"give it a bit soft. And I'm not"},"832":{"dur":4,"text":"worried about if it's going to run over. [Graeme] You've got some really beautiful"},"836":{"dur":4,"text":"pieces and there's one called Swirl. I really like the colors in that and that's done"},"840":{"dur":4,"text":"with [Shazia] That's with gouache and watercolor. [Graeme] Okay, there you go."},"844":{"dur":4,"text":"[Shazia] Mixed media. [Graeme] And then Nude 2 that you've actually"},"848":{"dur":4,"text":"you weren't happy with one picture. You re-gouached the whole thing and then painted"},"852":{"dur":4,"text":"painted the nude over the top of that. [Shazia] Yeah, I did be to the scene of London and"},"856":{"dur":4,"text":"I was not happy with the way it was going, so I"},"860":{"dur":4,"text":"just gessoed over it. Turned it it upside down and re-painted the"},"864":{"dur":4,"text":"that one and, you know, it turned out to be good. Okay, so"},"868":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm just glazing over a bit with the medium tone."},"872":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] So the last time you where in New York at the New York Art Expo, you had"},"876":{"dur":4,"text":"really quite a great response from a number of different"},"880":{"dur":4,"text":"countries and galleries wanting your work. [Shazia] Yeah. So"},"884":{"dur":4,"text":"the best thing about that is like you know, you are exhibiting and your work, and"},"888":{"dur":4,"text":"a lot of people they go past your booth, and I did get"},"892":{"dur":4,"text":"a very, very good response from there, that now I've been offered to"},"896":{"dur":4,"text":"exhibit in Paris, London, Miami."},"900":{"dur":4,"text":"Practically all over the world, Sweden as well. So we just really"},"904":{"dur":4,"text":"exciting. [Graeme] But also you've been in the Florence Biennale."},"908":{"dur":4,"text":"You actually had two beautiful pieces really, really individual 3"},"912":{"dur":4,"text":"dimensional pieces. One was called Entwined Transcendence, which"},"916":{"dur":4,"text":"is pretty amazing the way you've put those together, they're like sculptors themselves."},"920":{"dur":4,"text":"And then the other one that you had was called Eternal Splendour. What was the motivation behind those?"},"924":{"dur":4,"text":"[Shazia] These two pieces I have actually combined not only all my background,"},"928":{"dur":4,"text":"or my heritage, but also my experience I had in"},"932":{"dur":4,"text":"Florence, then the last time I was there. And because I work on sculpture and painting as well,"},"936":{"dur":4,"text":"these two pieces were a balance between sculpture and painting as well. So It's kind of"},"940":{"dur":4,"text":"a relief form. The organisers, they gave us a topic which is"},"944":{"dur":4,"text":"art and policies and the relationship between man and the environment. And Florence"},"948":{"dur":4,"text":"itself as a centre or hub of Renaissance movement."},"952":{"dur":4,"text":"So the art actually depicting those two topics."},"956":{"dur":4,"text":"So in one piece I have actually focused more on the statue of David and  Academic,"},"960":{"dur":4,"text":"and how the building and the sculpture inspired me so much."},"964":{"dur":4,"text":"And the second piece is more about spiritual connections,"},"968":{"dur":4,"text":"and what my fields were in Florence. [Graeme] So as part"},"972":{"dur":4,"text":"of being out in Cherrybrook in Sydney, you've also become part"},"976":{"dur":4,"text":"of an artists Collective for the Australian Art and Design"},"980":{"dur":4,"text":"Collective. [Shazia] Coming back from New York I'd been inundated with"},"984":{"dur":4,"text":"with offers from all over the world, and I thought why not share"},"988":{"dur":4,"text":"this experience with other artists, so I did start this Collective."},"992":{"dur":4,"text":"We are actually going to be a group of people exhibiting different"},"996":{"dur":4,"text":"areas in Sydney. And we do have an online existence at the moment which is"},"1000":{"dur":4,"text":"aadgallery.com. And I'm actually"},"1004":{"dur":4,"text":"gathering some local artists to promote them and you know, display their work"},"1008":{"dur":4,"text":"in social media and on the web site. [Graeme] I think it helps with your background"},"1012":{"dur":4,"text":"in marketing and digital media as well. [Shazia] Yeah, because I've been"},"1016":{"dur":4,"text":"in working and designing web sites, it has been really helpful"},"1020":{"dur":4,"text":"helpful to get some experience from there, and into art"},"1024":{"dur":4,"text":"as well. [Graeme] When you first started your art career, it was as many artist do,"},"1028":{"dur":4,"text":"was really about discipline and line and"},"1032":{"dur":4,"text":"capturing it exactly as it is. But now as you've matured as an artist,"},"1036":{"dur":4,"text":"you think you've well realised that it's just about the impression,"},"1040":{"dur":4,"text":"expression that you put into your work. [Shazia] Yeah."},"1044":{"dur":4,"text":"So basically when I first started I started learning the basic technique, and"},"1048":{"dur":4,"text":"human form, and a bit more detailed and more traditional stuff."},"1052":{"dur":4,"text":"Because I thought, you know, I needed to learn these techniques, and like"},"1056":{"dur":4,"text":"I've heard that, you know, you need to know the rules to break the rules. I'm just"},"1060":{"dur":4,"text":"start giving a little bit of impression of the muscles and you know, just body"},"1064":{"dur":4,"text":"shape a bit but not going in more details. [Graeme] So that's just the pastels"},"1068":{"dur":4,"text":"that you're using now? [Shazia] That's just the pastel, again I'm going to blend it in later."},"1072":{"dur":4,"text":"And if I really want to keep that  texture there,"},"1076":{"dur":4,"text":"I would use the oil pastel. [Graeme] Yeah."},"1080":{"dur":4,"text":"[Shazia] And oil pastel basically creates a resistance as well, so"},"1084":{"dur":4,"text":"if I go over with a glaze with any other acrylic color,"},"1088":{"dur":4,"text":"it will actually show through this and just block"},"1092":{"dur":4,"text":"those areas for me. [Graeme] It's actually drawing with oil paint, which is"},"1096":{"dur":4,"text":"fantastic. There's a lot of galleries that have suffered over the last"},"1100":{"dur":4,"text":"decade really, and artists seem to be taking control of their careers a lot more."},"1104":{"dur":4,"text":"You find the Art Trade Shows are very beneficial. [Shazia] Personally I have."},"1108":{"dur":4,"text":"I've had avery good experience with Trade Shows, and I think in this digital age,"},"1112":{"dur":4,"text":"everyone needs to be more aware of a lot of galleries they are closing down unfortunately,"},"1116":{"dur":4,"text":"and they are going online. So I think artists they need to"},"1120":{"dur":4,"text":"be understanding of the fact that, you know, people are actually quite accessible."},"1124":{"dur":4,"text":"Consumers are accessible through online world and through art"},"1128":{"dur":4,"text":"shows, or through Colour In Your Life. I think that's the most effective"},"1132":{"dur":4,"text":"media to actually get your work across an broader range of audience."},"1136":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] And also being in New York at the Art Expo"},"1140":{"dur":4,"text":"you've painted some wonderful pieces. One called Glow"},"1144":{"dur":4,"text":"After the Rain, which is a blue street scene - very"},"1148":{"dur":4,"text":"emotive that one. [Shazia] I remember we put a"},"1152":{"dur":4,"text":"collage piece there. It's almost you can see it's blended in"},"1156":{"dur":4,"text":"with the paint and glaze I've applied on top.
