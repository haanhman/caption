what it did?"},"1078":{"dur":4,"text":"It sent telemetry back to\nthe intelligent security graph."},"1082":{"dur":3,"text":"Right there you just saw data\nthat made the graph

and"},"1191":{"dur":1,"text":"the same security would be applied."},"1195":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay, now, I just wanna emphasize\nhere the importance of having to"},"1200":{"dur":1,"text":"engineer that."},"1201":{"dur":3,"text":"That experience, if you're\nchallenging your user with too"},"1204":{"dur":3,"text":"many multi-factor authentications,\nthey get tired of

what I really wanna understand\nis what users does this impact?"},"1260":{"dur":1,"text":"So I can come take\na look here at the users"},"1262":{"dur":1,"text":"that have been flagged for

can exclude some."},"1306":{"dur":1,"text":"I can then define the policy itself."},"1308":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, so\nI'm saying I wanna put a policy in"},"1310":{"dur":3,"text":"place whenever

I could also say\nallow access but"},"1320":{"dur":1,"text":"require multi-factor authentication."},"1321":{"dur":1,"text":"And then right here I can get a view"},"1323":{"dur":1,"text":"of the number of users\nthat would be impacted."},"1324":{"dur":3,"text":"So I get that preflight to make\nsure I don't turn something on and"},"1327":{"dur":0,"text":"kill my

back\nto the overview here,"},"1337":{"dur":1,"text":"one of the things you see here\nthat we're pulling out is hey,"},"1339":{"dur":3,"text":"you've got too many administrators,\ntoo many global

are and what they're doing."},"1354":{"dur":1,"text":"So I can come take a look here and"},"1355":{"dur":2,"text":"I can see that there are 13\nglobal administrators."},"1358":{"dur":3,"text":"Eight are active,\nsix are eligible to be shut down."},"1363":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, so let me click on this,\nand what you can see here,"},"1365":{"dur":2,"text":"you can see now all of these users\nwho have administrator privilege,"},"1368":{"dur":2,"text":"I wanna call this one right here."},"1370":{"dur":2,"text":"This is just in time administration."},"1373":{"dur":3,"text":"Again one of the EMS

have"},"1385":{"dur":2,"text":"administrator privilege and\nare not logging in,"},"1388":{"dur":2,"text":"you gave them access at one time and\nforgot about it, so"},"1390":{"dur":1,"text":"this helps you to minimize that,\nokay?"},"1392":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, I\u2019m gonna show you something\nwe\u2019ve never showed ever,"},"1396":{"dur":3,"text":"outside of a handful,\nof a few people on the EMS

more."},"1436":{"dur":2,"text":"So I can go in and say,\nlisten, okay, I'm gonna go and"},"1438":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm gonna say in this case I'm only\ngoing to allow iOS to access

actually go and\nput the apps if I wanted to."},"1451":{"dur":3,"text":"Over here I can actually come in and\nsay listen, I'm gonna go build"},"1454":{"dur":3,"text":"a policy and I want to specifically\nassign this to two specific apps."},"1458":{"dur":3,"text":"I want to apply this to Exchange and\nI want to apply this to Salesforce,"},"1461":{"dur":1,"text":"and so I can get very granular."},"1463":{"dur":3,"text":"But then here, I can build up\nthose policies based upon device,"},"1466":{"dur":1,"text":"what apps, location."},"1468":{"dur":1,"text":"This is where some of our\npartnerships like the partnership"},"1470":{"dur":2,"text":"with Lookout will also surface."},"1472":{"dur":2,"text":"And our partners will also be\nsurfacing risk data in here that you"},"1475":{"dur":0,"text":"can build a policy on."},"1477":{"dur":2,"text":"Then what I can do is simply say,\nI wanna apply that."},"1480":{"dur":2,"text":"And right here,\nI can grant access on this."},"1482":{"dur":1,"text":"Now look at the power of\nwhat we can allow you to do."},"1484":{"dur":3,"text":"I can come in and say okay,\nI'm going to allow access to either"},"1487":{"dur":2,"text":"a managed device as compliant or\na managed app."},"1489":{"dur":3,"text":"If either one of those is in place,\nI will allow access."},"1495":{"dur":1,"text":"But think of the power here."},"1496":{"dur":4,"text":"You can now build conditional access\npolicies based upon user risk,"},"1500":{"dur":1,"text":"device risk,"},"1501":{"dur":4,"text":"app risk, risk coming in from our\npartners like Lookout and others."},"1506":{"dur":3,"text":"And all this is active for you real\ntime and as users come in to ask and"},"1510":{"dur":3,"text":"request services, we turn it off or\nwe turn it on, we allow or"},"1513":{"dur":1,"text":"we deny based upon this risk."},"1515":{"dur":2,"text":"That's powerful."},"1518":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, come on,\ngive me some

questions."},"1538":{"dur":2,"text":"We just showed you how\nto answer five of them."},"1541":{"dur":1,"text":"You now know who's\naccessing your data and"},"1543":{"dur":2,"text":"if something is suspicious there,\nwe'll trigger the MFA."},"1546":{"dur":2,"text":"It will stop an attacker\nfrom coming in."},"1549":{"dur":3,"text":"You can control access to your data\nin real time, based upon a

off."},"1558":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, and you get all that value."},"1561":{"dur":1,"text":"Let me give you just\na couple examples."},"1562":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, first of all, this right\nhere is what you saw that is new."},"1565":{"dur":2,"text":"These are all the things that are\nnew as you're coming to the event"},"1567":{"dur":2,"text":"today that you should\nget educated

time,"},"1598":{"dur":1,"text":"any where."},"1599":{"dur":1,"text":"But they had to make\nsure that it was secure."},"1601":{"dur":2,"text":"So what they've doing is they've\nbeen rolling out Office

it."},"1671":{"dur":3,"text":"But you also want a system that's\nable to detect when users are trying"},"1674":{"dur":3,"text":"to do the right thing, maybe go\noutside of those guard rails, and"},"1678":{"dur":1,"text":"you want to guide them back in."},"1679":{"dur":1,"text":"And you want it to be\nbehind the scenes."},"1681":{"dur":1,"text":"You want it to be

are seamless."},"1702":{"dur":2,"text":"It has to be engineered for IT and"},"1704":{"dur":3,"text":"for end users from the start,\nit can't be a bolt on."},"1709":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's why we've been working so"},"1711":{"dur":3,"text":"hard to make sure that we make\nthis as seamless as possible."},"1714":{"dur":2,"text":"Now there's a couple of\nfascinating stats here."},"1716":{"dur":3,"text":"58% of workers have told us that\nthey know and they admit to"},"1719":{"dur":4,"text":"accidentally having sent data to\npeople that they shouldn't

do you protect\nagainst things like that?"},"1748":{"dur":3,"text":"And so what we've been working on\nhere is literally trying to help you"},"1751":{"dur":1,"text":"understand how to do that."},"1752":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, there are three use\ncases that we focus on."},"1755":{"dur":2,"text":"One, you've got people who\nare good corporate citizens and"},"1757":{"dur":1,"text":"they're doing their best\nto do the right thing."},"1759":{"dur":2,"text":"And they wanna do the right thing."},"1761":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you're kinda helping them\nunderstand, in a seamless way, how"},"1764":{"dur":3,"text":"to protect the company data, man,\nthey love it, they appreciate that."},"1768":{"dur":2,"text":"Increasingly, these users\nneed to share data inside and"},"1770":{"dur":1,"text":"outside of the company."},"1772":{"dur":2,"text":"So data has to be\nable to be mobile and"},"1774":{"dur":3,"text":"be in transit to be\nfully productive."},"1777":{"dur":1,"text":"And then, you have malicious users."},"1779":{"dur":2,"text":"You have users who have ill intent."},"1781":{"dur":2,"text":"You have to acknowledge\nthat we have

ill\nintent, and then take action."},"1799":{"dur":2,"text":"Hi, let's go show you\nanother set of demos here and"},"1802":{"dur":3,"text":"we're gonna walk you through\nnow a bunch of the things"},"1805":{"dur":3,"text":"that we have done in a very seamless\nway to help you understand what it"},"1809":{"dur":3,"text":"is that we can do now to help\nyou in a seamless way protect."},"1815":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm gonna go back now\nback onto my iPad here."},"1818":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, we're talking about detect."},"1820":{"dur":2,"text":"So let me walk in and show you\na very typical user scenario."},"1823":{"dur":1,"text":"So here I am in Word."},"1824":{"dur":2,"text":"Now one of the biggest challenges we\nhave as we thought about the Office"},"1827":{"dur":1,"text":"mobile applications is"},"1829":{"dur":2,"text":"how do we protect the data\nwhen it's company data?"},"1831":{"dur":2,"text":"But when it's personal data,\nstay out of it and"},"1833":{"dur":1,"text":"honor the user's privacy."},"1835":{"dur":2,"text":"The Office mobile apps are unique\nand that people use them in their"},"1838":{"dur":1,"text":"personal life

be"},"3368":{"dur":2,"text":"able to see that is immense."},"3370":{"dur":2,"text":"So what we've been working on and\none of the things we"},"3373":{"dur":3,"text":"announced today is we've

I wanna learn more\nabout the file itself."},"3492":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'm gonna click on the file, and\nwhat it's gonna do now is it makes"},"3495":{"dur":2,"text":"a query back to the
