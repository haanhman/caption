And as I started"},"237":{"dur":6,"text":"looking into it, I started seeing there was\na lot of problems with it. Like people being"},"243":{"dur":5,"text":"able to light their wells on fire. And coming\ndown with brain lesions. And their well caps"},"249":{"dur":5,"text":"blowing 50, 60 feet into the air. And their\nwater becoming contaminated.

It was gonna change"},"286":{"dur":6,"text":"our world. It was gonna make jobs for us.\nAnd it was just this incredible thing. And"},"292":{"dur":8,"text":"in time we've come to find out that it isn't\nso incredible. So I began basically, I went"},"301":{"dur":6,"text":"to Dimick, PA with Robert Kennedy, Junior\nand I saw a group of people, probably 40 people,"},"307":{"dur":7,"text":"who had their wells contaminated with natural\ngas from hydrofracking. And there was no one"},"315":{"dur":5,"text":"there to help them. And they literally looked\nat Robert Kennedy Junior as if he was Jesus"},"320":{"dur":7,"text":"Christ himself and walked across the water\nto save them. Unfortunately at that time,"},"327":{"dur":7,"text":"Robert Kennedy Junior had been toking off\nthe natural gas pipe and was a big natural"},"334":{"dur":8,"text":"gas advocate. It's taken us two years to turn\nhim around. But, by God, we have.

Something on par to"},"369":{"dur":9,"text":"probably Houdini more than Jesus Christ. But\nI recognized an enormous need that they had"},"378":{"dur":5,"text":"that wasn't being filled, neither by their\nlegislative body in the state of Pennsylvania"},"384":{"dur":6,"text":"nor by the EPA which had been exempt, this\nindustry had been exempted from any federal"},"391":{"dur":9,"text":"regulation. And they were asking for my help.\nAnd I decided that I would run as far away"},"401":{"dur":3,"text":"from them as I possibly could."},"404":{"dur":5,"text":"But I couldn't run away from myself. And I\nrealized that I wouldn't be the human being"},"409":{"dur":6,"text":"that I say I am, if I turned my back on them.\nEssentially I'd be turning my back on my own"},"416":{"dur":7,"text":"children and my own community just across\nthe Delaware River. And so I began fighting"},"423":{"dur":9,"text":"hydrofracking in New York State. And at some\npoint that wasn't enough for me. I felt like"},"433":{"dur":6,"text":"you can't really be effective at fighting\nsomething unless you can come up with an alternative"},"439":{"dur":10,"text":"to that thing, that was viable, and that was\ncredible. And so in my very, I like to model"},"449":{"dur":6,"text":"myself after Percival the Fool, I went like\nthe fool into the world saying \"I don't know"},"456":{"dur":4,"text":"what the hell I'm doing or what I'm talking\nabout, but I'd like to go find some people"},"460":{"dur":8,"text":"that do know what they're doing and what they're\ntalking about.

They wanted to honor me with\nan environmental award. I didn't feel like"},"478":{"dur":9,"text":"I deserved it. But I didn't wanna be an asshole,\nso I went. And while I was there, shortly"},"487":{"dur":7,"text":"after I gave my speech on natural gas to a\nvery large group of people who at that time"},"495":{"dur":9,"text":"still believed that natural gas was the answer.\nAnd I was there to say \"No.\" Well, after it,"},"504":{"dur":6,"text":"this crazy Dutchman came up to me and he said\n\"Hi, I'm Marcellus.

And Marco Krapels real name is Marcellus.\nAnd I kinda, he said \"You know, we have to"},"525":{"dur":6,"text":"talk about the solutions.\" Like I kinda had\nsaid well, I wanna do this crazy thing, I"},"532":{"dur":6,"text":"wanna, why aren't we going to renewable, why\nare we gonna go to natural gas and then renewable."},"538":{"dur":5,"text":"I mean why not go directly to renewables.\nLike why do we have to bridge to it? Like"},"544":{"dur":6,"text":"why don't we hang-glide over it? And he said\n\"Come to California, I'm gonna put together"},"550":{"dur":8,"text":"some meetings. We're doing this here and I\nthink you can do it in New York.\" And he brought"},"559":{"dur":9,"text":"me to a dinner and at that dinner was Professor\nMark Jacobson. And a lot of other really influential"},"568":{"dur":6,"text":"people in the renewable space. And what I\nstarted to hear was what I believed in my"},"575":{"dur":5,"text":"heart. Was that we actually could make this\ntransition. Without introducing an entire"},"580":{"dur":8,"text":"new fossil fuel infrastructure to our nation\nthat would cost us 700 billion dollars to"},"588":{"dur":7,"text":"build out. And we actually could hang glide\nover natural gas and move directly to renewable"},"596":{"dur":11,"text":"energy. And we could do it in my lifetime.\nAnd that was the beginning of this journey."},"607":{"dur":6,"text":"And along this journey I only knew that the\nonly thing that I could offer to these brilliant"},"613":{"dur":11,"text":"people was that I was a conduit of information\nto my culture. To the culture. And we're in"},"625":{"dur":7,"text":"an information war. Really is what this is\nabout. It's about education. Because the truth"},"632":{"dur":11,"text":"is that we can do this. We're technologically\npoised to do it. But there's an enormous political"},"644":{"dur":11,"text":"lobbying structure in place in this country\nthat is telling us that we can't do it. And"},"655":{"dur":8,"text":"that we are bound to be a fossil fuel nation\nfor another 50, 60, 100 years. And that just"},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"isn't the truth."},"665":{"dur":11,"text":"And so I started to try and make myself knowledged\nin what the truth was. By going to scientists."},"677":{"dur":7,"text":"Going to business leaders, going to bankers,\nand asking \"Is this possible? And how do we"},"685":{"dur":9,"text":"do it?\" And that was basically how I came\nto be sitting here with these two extraordinary"},"694":{"dur":6,"text":"gentlemen. There's another gentleman here\nnamed Jon Wank from Skadaddle who is basically"},"701":{"dur":7,"text":"our media genius. And we figure that if you\ncan handle the science and the culture and"},"708":{"dur":5,"text":"the banking and the economics and then have\na platform to get the message out, we actually"},"714":{"dur":7,"text":"have a chance of making this thing happen.\nAnd so the idea of solutions was born."},"722":{"dur":7,"text":"And none of us are on the payroll of anybody.\nWe all flew ourselves here today. We are only"},"729":{"dur":6,"text":"compelled to move forward with this mission\nbecause we have children. And we believe that"},"736":{"dur":6,"text":"it's the right and responsible thing for each\nof us to do. And that gives us an enormous"},"742":{"dur":6,"text":"amount of credibility in the face of who our\nopponent is and the enormous amount of political"},"749":{"dur":6,"text":"and economic power that they wield against\nus. And so, at this moment, I would gladly"},"756":{"dur":1,"text":"like to shut up."},"757":{"dur":1,"text":"[laughter]"},"758":{"dur":6,"text":"And turn over this podium to the great Professor\nMark Jacobson from Stanford."},"764":{"dur":1,"text":"[applause]"},"765":{"dur":8,"text":">>Mark Jacobson: This really came to fruition\nin 2009 when Dr. Mark Delucchi of UC Davis"},"774":{"dur":6,"text":"and I published a paper in Scientific American\non how to power the world with renewable energy."},"780":{"dur":6,"text":"Really the question was, was it technically\nfeasible to do this? And did we have enough"},"787":{"dur":7,"text":"materials? Were there enough resources available?\nWhat were the costs like? Was it really possible"},"794":{"dur":6,"text":"to power the entire world? And by extension\nof course the United States and individual"},"800":{"dur":9,"text":"states. And it was by fortune that I met Mark\nRuffalo and Marco Krapels, and some others,"},"809":{"dur":6,"text":"Jon Wank and others in our group. It was very\nfortunate because, and it's actually been"},"815":{"dur":5,"text":"very exciting, because I, we, kind of working\nas a scientist you're often working on your"},"821":{"dur":4,"text":"own and in a small group. And nobody really\nwants to listen to the scientists who put"},"825":{"dur":6,"text":"out reports. And then there are people who\nput out things to try to discredit you. Or"},"832":{"dur":6,"text":"to try to minimize whatever you do. And so\nthis is actually an opportunity I think to"},"838":{"dur":6,"text":"bring the information out. I mean, my job,\nI feel, is to bring, to study a subject and"},"845":{"dur":5,"text":"then bring that information out to the public\nand to students and to the world, to clarify"},"850":{"dur":7,"text":"it. And so that's what I want to do here today.\nSo really what I wanna talk about in the next"},"858":{"dur":3,"text":"few minutes and it might take a little more\nthan a few minutes. But it's how to power"},"862":{"dur":5,"text":"the world and the United States with renewable\nenergy. Is it really feasible? So first of"},"867":{"dur":9,"text":"all, why do we wanna do that? And I'm gonna\ntry to [pause]. There we go. Oops. I think"},"877":{"dur":1,"text":"we just went to the end. [laughs]"},"879":{"dur":1,"text":"[laughter]"},"880":{"dur":5,"text":"There we go. I think we're even, one more\nback. There. OK. Well, anyway."},"886":{"dur":4,"text":"So what is the problem? Why do we need to\ndo this first of all? From my point of view,"},"890":{"dur":4,"text":"it's from an air pollution and climate point\nof view. Two and a half to three million people"},"895":{"dur":5,"text":"die every year from air pollution, from cardiovascular\ndisease, respiratory illness, complications"},"900":{"dur":7,"text":"from asthma, disease, pneumonia, in fact,\nabout 15 to 20 percent of these are children"},"907":{"dur":7,"text":"under five years of age in developing countries.\nAnd this number is growing. And global warming"},"915":{"dur":5,"text":"is a significant problem whether or not you\nbelieve it, it's true. It's happening. The"},"920":{"dur":4,"text":"temperature changes today are faster. The\nrate of change of temperature today is faster"},"925":{"dur":6,"text":"than any time since the deglaciation from\nthe last ice age. And this is a significant"},"931":{"dur":5,"text":"issue because half of global warming is actually\nbeing hidden or masked by what are called"},"936":{"dur":5,"text":"cooling pollutant aerosol particles. The particles\nthat you actually see in the air from pollution"},"941":{"dur":4,"text":"are hiding half of global warming. So if we\nactually clean up all of the air pollution"},"946":{"dur":3,"text":"particles in the world which we want to do\nbecause these are the ones that cause the"},"949":{"dur":3,"text":"two and a half to three million deaths, most\nof them, then we would actually double global"},"953":{"dur":4,"text":"warming instantaneously. That's a scary problem."},"958":{"dur":6,"text":"The Arctic sea ice is disappearing rapidly\nas I'll show you. And this is also scary because"},"964":{"dur":5,"text":"within 20 years, if it disappears, then there\nwill be possibly a rapid tipping point where"},"970":{"dur":5,"text":"there'll be more rapid acceleration of warming.\nAnd populations are increasingly quickly and"},"975":{"dur":4,"text":"as a result, and there's rising energy demand.\nAnd our current fossil fuel infrastructure,"},"980":{"dur":5,"text":"the fuels themselves are short-lived. They're\nnot gonna be here even if we used them all"},"985":{"dur":5,"text":"for the next 100, 150 years, they're eventually\ngonna disappear. We're subject to significant"},"991":{"dur":4,"text":"price fluctuations. If we go to clean renewable\nenergy there are no price fluctuations because"},"996":{"dur":1,"text":"the fuel is free."},"997":{"dur":6,"text":"Now, let's, I just wanna show you an example.\nI mean, we look outside here in the Bay Area,"},"1003":{"dur":5,"text":"especially near the Bay and it's extremely\nclean looking most days. But you go most places"},"1009":{"dur":7,"text":"in the world, and it looks like this. And\nhere's Norilsk, Russia. Sukinda, India. Linfen,"},"1016":{"dur":5,"text":"China. It's like living here is like smoking\nthree packs of cigarettes every day. This"},"1021":{"dur":5,"text":"is the real problem in the world. And this\npollution, it's not only creates health problems,"},"1027":{"dur":5,"text":"but the darkness of the pollution means that\nit's absorbing sunlight and heating the air"},"1032":{"dur":5,"text":"and this is why these pollutant particles,\nthe dark ones, are the second leading cause"},"1037":{"dur":5,"text":"of global warming after carbon dioxide. The\nblack carbon and brown carbon in these particles."},"1042":{"dur":4,"text":"And they also cause health impacts. And they're\nalso very short lived. So if you control them,"},"1047":{"dur":4,"text":"they're actually a very fast method of slowing\nglobal warming. In fact if, they're the only"},"1051":{"dur":3,"text":"method, by controlling those particles is\nprobably the only method of saving the arctic"},"1054":{"dur":5,"text":"sea ice, because they're short lived. Along\nwith methane which is number three in terms"},"1060":{"dur":5,"text":"of the leading causes of global warming. And\nby the way methane, the main source of methane,"},"1065":{"dur":7,"text":"well one of the main sources, is from natural\ngas mining. And this is a big issue because"},"1072":{"dur":7,"text":"the short lived impact of that methane over\nthe 20 year time frame is 80 times more significant"},"1079":{"dur":3,"text":"per unit mass than carbon dioxide. 80 to 100\ntimes."},"1083":{"dur":6,"text":"Now this is the lungs of a teenager who died\nin the Los Angeles in the 1970s and this is"},"1090":{"dur":5,"text":"what the lungs of most teenagers in polluted\ncities of our world look like. So in the united"},"1096":{"dur":4,"text":"states there are 50,000 to 100,000 die every\nyear prematurely from air pollution. In California,"},"1100":{"dur":6,"text":"it's about 20,000 to 23,000. And this is a\nproblem that still needs to be solved. And"},"1107":{"dur":5,"text":"that doesn't count all the illnesses and lost\nwork days and school days. The higher taxes"},"1112":{"dur":4,"text":"we pay. And the higher insurance costs that\nresult."},"1117":{"dur":8,"text":"I talked about the sea ice. This shows from\n1900 to 2010, or 2011, the Arctic sea ice"},"1125":{"dur":4,"text":"in different seasons. The green which is on\nthe bottom which is the most rapidly decreasing"},"1129":{"dur":5,"text":"in the summer. But you can see that the sea\nice is decreasing in all seasons. But it's"},"1135":{"dur":5,"text":"expected to entirely disappear within 20 to\n30 years unless we do something."},"1141":{"dur":5,"text":"And as I mentioned the temperature of the\nearth is increasing rapidly. It's the rate"},"1146":{"dur":5,"text":"of change of temperature that's so high today.\nAnd it just hasn't been this high. We've had"},"1152":{"dur":5,"text":"higher temperatures on average. 100 million\nyears ago the earth was ice free. But nobody"},"1157":{"dur":4,"text":"lived back then. So we didn't have 7 billion\npeople on the earth. If we melt all the ice"},"1162":{"dur":5,"text":"that's stored in the Antarctic mostly but\nthe Arctic and all the glaciers, we would"},"1167":{"dur":5,"text":"increase the sea levels, by, on the order\nof 65 to 70 meters and we'd flood seven percent"},"1172":{"dur":4,"text":"of all the world's land, along the coast.\nAnd that's where most people live. So this"},"1177":{"dur":1,"text":"is an issue."},"1178":{"dur":1,"text":"So what's the solution?"},"1180":{"dur":7,"text":"So the solution, we think, is based on scientific\nanalysis that was done in 2009 before the"},"1187":{"dur":6,"text":"Scientific American article, was what we call\n\"wind, water, and sun.\" So what was recommended,"},"1194":{"dur":5,"text":"based on just ignoring the costs at first,\nwe looked at a bunch of different technologies"},"1199":{"dur":4,"text":"and found that the best ones in terms of their\nenvironmental benefits, in terms of health"},"1203":{"dur":9,"text":"and climate. In terms of catastrophic risk.\nIn terms of creating a reliable energy supply"},"1212":{"dur":8,"text":"as well, simultaneously reducing water pollution,\nwere wind, and concentrated solar power, geothermal"},"1221":{"dur":6,"text":"power, tidal power, wave power, solar photovoltaics,\nhydroelectric power. And that's for electric"},"1227":{"dur":5,"text":"power. For transportation it's using these\nelectricity sources to power battery electric"},"1233":{"dur":4,"text":"vehicles. And in some cases hydrogen fuel\ncell vehicles. And the reason battery electrics"},"1238":{"dur":4,"text":"are so good is that they're four to five times\nmore efficient than internal combustion. So"},"1243":{"dur":8,"text":"in other words, for every gallon of gas you\nput into your tank, only about 17 to 20 percent"},"1251":{"dur":4,"text":"of the energy in that gas goes to move your\ncare. The rest is waste heat. Of every unit"},"1256":{"dur":5,"text":"of electricity you plug into your car, about\n80 to 86 percent actually goes to moving your"},"1261":{"dur":4,"text":"car. The rest is waste heat. As a result,\nelectricity is so much more, it's four to"},"1266":{"dur":2,"text":"five times more efficient than gasoline."},"1268":{"dur":5,"text":"So the best way to reduce your energy consumption\nis to use an electric vehicle. By far. Converting"},"1274":{"dur":6,"text":"from a combustion vehicle to an electric vehicle.\nIn fact, as a result, the cost of the electricity"},"1280":{"dur":5,"text":"to run your car is equivalent to about 80\ncents to a dollar a gallon, compared to four"},"1285":{"dur":2,"text":"dollars plus or whatever the price of gas\nis right now."},"1288":{"dur":6,"text":"Now, I'll get back to that later. But what's\nnot recommended in our list, not because they're"},"1294":{"dur":5,"text":"not in some cases better than what we have\ncurrently, in other cases it is not so good,"},"1300":{"dur":7,"text":"are nuclear, coal with carbon capture, any\nkind of natural gas or biomass. Corn or cellulosic,"},"1307":{"dur":6,"text":"or sugarcane ethanol, soy or algae biodiesel.\nOr compressed natural gas. These are not recommended"},"1313":{"dur":4,"text":"options. And again I'm not trying to criticize\nthem, although some of these you can really"},"1317":{"dur":5,"text":"criticize a lot. But I'm just saying they're\nnot so good as what we call the wind, water,"},"1323":{"dur":2,"text":"and sun options. Which I'll show you why."},"1325":{"dur":5,"text":"So for example, why not nuclear power? Everyone\nthinks \"Oh, it's clean power.\" Well, in fact,"},"1331":{"dur":4,"text":"because of the, you need to mind the uranium,\nand refine it, continuously over the life"},"1335":{"dur":5,"text":"of the power plant, and then use it and then\nyou have to store the waste, it's, and that's"},"1341":{"dur":3,"text":"half of the emissions are associated. There\nare two coal fire power plants in the US whose"},"1345":{"dur":7,"text":"sole purpose is to refine uranium for nuclear\npower plus weapons. But there's also the fact"},"1352":{"dur":8,"text":"it takes like 11 to 19 years to put up a nuclear\nreactor. And due to, not only due to the construction"},"1361":{"dur":7,"text":"time but due to the permitting time and planning\ntime, it compared to like two to five years"},"1368":{"dur":6,"text":"for a wind or solar farm, generally. So in\nthe meantime you're running the current electric"},"1374":{"dur":6,"text":"power grid which is 55 to 60 percent coal.\nSo there's an opportunity cost by going to"},"1381":{"dur":5,"text":"say nuclear versus wind due to this time lag\nbetween planning and operation. That's huge."},"1386":{"dur":7,"text":"So between the two of those additional emissions\nsources, you have nine to 25 times more carbon"},"1394":{"dur":4,"text":"equivalent emissions and air pollution per\nkilowatt hour generated from nuclear than"},"1398":{"dur":4,"text":"you do from wind power. But that's not even\nthe major problem. There's the risk of meltdown."},"1403":{"dur":5,"text":"One and a half percent of all nuclear reactors\never built, and there have been about 440,"},"1408":{"dur":4,"text":"have melted down to some degree. And there's\nnuclear weapons proliferation. There are five"},"1412":{"dur":4,"text":"countries that have secretly developed nuclear\nweapons capability under the guise of nuclear"},"1416":{"dur":4,"text":"energy facilities, that were supposed to be\nused for civilian purposes."},"1421":{"dur":5,"text":"And there are unresolved waste issues. Why\nnot, what's called \"clean coal?\" Well, what"},"1426":{"dur":7,"text":"clean coal is, is you dump, you take the CO2\nexhaust from the exhaust of the coal plant"},"1434":{"dur":5,"text":"and you pump it underground.

Because\nthere's a lot of unemployment in the central"},"2774":{"dur":9,"text":"valley. And they invested in a four million\ndollar power plant. Solar power plant.

I think one of the weak\npoints I saw, one of the things I was wondering"},"3571":{"dur":6,"text":"about was batteries.
