right?"},"653":{"dur":3,"text":"So for you, how do you\npick your one thing?"},"656":{"dur":4,"text":"Here's my advice: take a piece of paper\nand draw a line down the middle."},"660":{"dur":4,"text":"On the left hand side list all\nof the skills you're trying to improve."},"665":{"dur":4,"text":"Then on the right hand side\nfor each skill, on a scale of 1 to

the highest number\nand work your way down."},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"So, you know yourself,\nyou've got your one thing."},"685":{"dur":4,"text":"If you stop here, you're making\na mistake I see all

think we've established\nthat that was \"no bueno\"."},"712":{"dur":5,"text":"So, the only thing at this point standing\nbetween you and awesome is daily practice."},"718":{"dur":4,"text":"For hundreds of years people used\nto think that excellence was inborn."},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"For example, scientists used to think\nthat the best marathon runners"},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"had

is\nthat they earn it through daily practice."},"739":{"dur":3,"text":"So, the best marathon runners\ndon't actually show physical differences;"},"743":{"dur":4,"text":"what's different is how much they train\nin the weeks leading up to the marathon."},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"So, let's go back to Steve, shall we?"},"752":{"dur":4,"text":"Steve learned to practice daily\nby developing a habit."},"756":{"dur":4,"text":"Everyday on his way to work he'd think\nabout what he was trying to improve,"},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"and he'd make a plan to practice it."},"763":{"dur":3,"text":"Then on the way home,\nhe would think about how he did,"},"766":{"dur":3,"text":"and maybe some ideas\nfor what he would the next day."},"770":{"dur":5,"text":"In sum total, Steve probably spent\nless than 30 minutes a week doing this,"},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"and he saw massive returns."},"778":{"dur":4,"text":"In less than six months,\nhis team started closing new deals."},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"He felt happier and more confident,"},"786":{"dur":3,"text":"and his boss, who hired me, was ecstatic."},"791":{"dur":3,"text":"So, what do you think?\nAre some people born to be great?"},"794":{"dur":1,"text":"Sometimes."},"796":{"dur":3,"text":"But my belief is this: Steve showed us\nthat with effort and commitment"},"800":{"dur":1,"text":"almost anyone can be better."},"802":{"dur":1,"text":"In his case a better leader."},"805":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, by the way, I always say\nthat 96% of leaders can improve."},"811":{"dur":3,"text":"The other 4% are what we call sociopaths"},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"(Laughter)"},"817":{"dur":5,"text":"who lack the ability to connect with other\npeople on a fundamental human level."},"823":{"dur":5,"text":"Right, so unless you're a sociopath,\nyou can be a better leader."},"828":{"dur":1,"text":"But I digress."},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's get back to practice."},"831":{"dur":2,"text":"The bottom line, you will not improve"},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"unless you make\na daily commitment to practice."},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"So, everyday, I want you\nto jump out of bed and say,"},"839":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Today is the day\nI'll get better at my one thing!\""},"843":{"dur":5,"text":"Some days you'll feel stuck. Other days\nyou'll be thrilled when something clicks."},"848":{"dur":4,"text":"But every day you'll learn,\nand every day you'll get better."},"854":{"dur":5,"text":"So, before we end, I want you\nto imagine that you are there."},"860":{"dur":3,"text":"You've become totally awesome\nat what you do."},"864":{"dur":4,"text":"What's that like?
