thank you."},"1488":{"dur":5,"text":">> [APPLAUSE] >> Well,"},"1494":{"dur":3,"text":"Ada Lovelace retained her interest in mathematics."},"1497":{"dur":1,"text":"And, one has to pause and"},"1499":{"dur":3,"text":"think about mathematics in the cultural context of the day."},"1502":{"dur":4,"text":"It was the age when people were starting to."},"1507":{"dur":3,"text":"Why was Babbage building his engines, building his engines to compute tables?"},"1510":{"dur":1,"text":"Why were they computing tables?"},"1512":{"dur":4,"text":"Because they were seeing the power of

it."},"1533":{"dur":4,"text":"Write papers, all of that kind of thing was starting to happen."},"1537":{"dur":4,"text":"And William Lovelace, Lovelace's husband became"},"1541":{"dur":4,"text":"rather interested in scientific approaches to agriculture, and"},"1545":{"dur":4,"text":"he wrote several lengthy papers addressing this sort of point."},"1550":{"dur":3,"text":"Which is as far as we know,

another footnote, which shows her broad scientific interest."},"1563":{"dur":3,"text":"This one, she's actually talking about photography,"},"1566":{"dur":4,"text":"not from the point of view of having her photograph taken, like a grand lady,"},"1570":{"dur":6,"text":"which she was, but the paraphotography in instrumentation."},"1577":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're trying to measure light levels,

importance of photography,"},"1634":{"dur":3,"text":"the importance of the experimental approach."},"1637":{"dur":5,"text":"Towards the end of her life she started thinking, and there's a lot been"},"1643":{"dur":3,"text":"written about this, and I'm only telling you about it in 30 seconds."},"1646":{"dur":1,"text":"So I can't say terribly much."},"1647":{"dur":4,"text":"But she started thinking about what she called a mathematical model of the nervous"},"1652":{"dur":2,"text":"system, or a calculus of the nervous system."},"1654":{"dur":4,"text":"And she started thinking about it, both in mathematical forms but"},"1658":{"dur":1,"text":"in experimental terms."},"1660":{"dur":3,"text":"She drew up, it's not clear how much experimental work she did,"},"1664":{"dur":2,"text":"how much mathematical work she did."},"1666":{"dur":4,"text":"But just the way she wrote about it is rather extraordinary."},"1670":{"dur":2,"text":"We've got the whole of this in the body of the display,

today."},"1681":{"dur":3,"text":"Yeah, you know, we can kind of figure out what we probably mean by that."},"1685":{"dur":2,"text":"But for somebody to say that in the 1840s,"},"1688":{"dur":4,"text":"to be thinking that way, I find quite extraordinary."},"1692":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think it's not something that's been written about."},"1696":{"dur":5,"text":"And perhaps the depths of cultural positioning it might have been."},"1702":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think this is a bigger question about Lovelace."},"1705":{"dur":4,"text":"One of the things that fascinates me about, as a scientist,"},"1709":{"dur":4,"text":"coming of this, but while I suppose there are several things that fascinate me."},"1714":{"dur":2,"text":"First of all, I'm always tempted to say gosh,"},"1716":{"dur":4,"text":"it's such fun working in the but I realize it's like a box of chocolates."},"1721":{"dur":2,"text":"It's all this amazing stuff."},"1724":{"dur":4,"text":"But I realize that's a bit like a typical response."},"1728":{"dur":1,"text":"When people meet a mathematician,"},"1729":{"dur":4,"text":"people sometimes say I could never do maths at school."},"1734":{"dur":2,"text":"And, you know, sometimes people meet somebody in the humanities, and"},"1737":{"dur":3,"text":"they say, gosh, it must be nice reading books all day."},"1740":{"dur":5,"text":"[LAUGH] So saying to the wow you're a box of chocolates is a bit [INAUDIBLE]."},"1746":{"dur":1,"text":"It's lovely and all sorts of amazing stuff."},"1747":{"dur":4,"text":"But it's brought me a new realization, I think, of two aspects."},"1752":{"dur":7,"text":"First of all that scientific archives are important."},"1759":{"dur":3,"text":"Scientific archives are important for present-day scientific problems,"},"1762":{"dur":1,"text":"not just for the history of science."},"1764":{"dur":4,"text":"So, all this data that people were gathering at the time."},"1769":{"dur":3,"text":"Oh, so John Clare was writing poems about the disappearance of some bird or other,"},"1772":{"dur":5,"text":"somebody else was modeling the plant that that ate which was disappearing."},"1778":{"dur":1,"text":"Cuz the plant was disappearing."},"1779":{"dur":1,"text":"Those records are somewhere."},"1781":{"dur":0,"text":"We can go back."},"1782":{"dur":3,"text":"We can go back and use that information in the spirit of,"},"1785":{"dur":2,"text":"well it won't be not very big data."},"1788":{"dur":4,"text":"Anyway, that data is still there for us to use as scientists today."},"1792":{"dur":4,"text":"But also it's a bigger issue of to really understand what's going on,"},"1797":{"dur":4,"text":"you need the cultural context, you need the humanities background,"},"1801":{"dur":2,"text":"you need the social science background."},"1803":{"dur":6,"text":"To look at where these ideas come from as Adrian Johnston was saying this morning."},"1810":{"dur":4,"text":"Now these ideas of machinery of operator of function."},"1814":{"dur":4,"text":"They didn't just appear in a vacuum, they appeared in a cultural context"},"1819":{"dur":4,"text":"as well as a scientific context and this is another quote from the famous"},"1824":{"dur":4,"text":"paper which bears out what I think, I'm not the first person to say."},"1828":{"dur":4,"text":"Somebody needs to take this paper and study it as literary object."},"1832":{"dur":3,"text":"As a not just as a scientific object."},"1835":{"dur":3,"text":"Those who view mathematical science not just as a vast body of abstract and"},"1839":{"dur":3,"text":"immutable truths whose intrinsic beauty, symmetry, logical completeness,"},"1843":{"dur":3,"text":"when regarded in their connection together as a whole entitle them to a prominent"},"1846":{"dur":1,"text":"place in the interest of all profound."},"1848":{"dur":1,"text":"Oh God, is there a comma anywhere?"},"1850":{"dur":3,"text":"[LAUGH] In the interest of all profound and logical minds."},"1853":{"dur":3,"text":"But as for a yet deeper interest for the human race,"},"1857":{"dur":4,"text":"when it is remembered that this science constitutes the language through which we"},"1862":{"dur":4,"text":"alone can adequately express the great facts of the natural world."},"1866":{"dur":3,"text":"And those unceasing changes of mutual relationship which visibly or"},"1870":{"dur":3,"text":"invisibly consciously or unconsciously, oh."},"1873":{"dur":2,"text":"Our immediate physical perceptions"},"1876":{"dur":4,"text":"are interminably going on in the the creation we live amongst."},"1880":{"dur":1,"text":"And suddenly we've got to the creation."},"1881":{"dur":1,"text":"We got to theology."},"1882":{"dur":4,"text":"We got to contemporary views on theology and the nature of mathematics."},"1886":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, is she feeling, she needs to put a bit of that gold stuff in so"},"1889":{"dur":1,"text":"she's not getting into trouble."},"1890":{"dur":3,"text":"It was rather, something rather deeper there going on, I think."},"1894":{"dur":1,"text":"I got to the semicolon."},"1895":{"dur":3,"text":"Those who thus think on mathematical truth, as the instrument through which"},"1899":{"dur":3,"text":"the

being."},"1917":{"dur":3,"text":"I find that kind of sentiment quite extraordinary."},"1921":{"dur":4,"text":"And I find, the conclusion I've drawn from all this, humanities people, please let me"},"1925":{"dur":3,"text":"keep coming to talk to you, and I'll try not to call the a box of chocolates."},"1929":{"dur":1,"text":">> [LAUGH] >> And"},"1931":{"dur":4,"text":"let's work together on
