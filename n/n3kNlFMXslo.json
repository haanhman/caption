lines,"},"49":{"dur":3,"text":"generally on how to help their readers\nfind an extra hour in the day."},"53":{"dur":3,"text":"And the idea is that we'll shave\nbits of time off everyday activities,"},"56":{"dur":1,"text":"add it up,"},"57":{"dur":2,"text":"and we'll have time for the good stuff."},"59":{"dur":4,"text":"I question the entire premise\nof this piece, but I'm always

is true."},"94":{"dur":2,"text":"You know another way to find\n32 minutes to exercise?"},"97":{"dur":2,"text":"Don't watch two hours of TV a day, right?"},"99":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"101":{"dur":3,"text":"Anyway, the idea is we'll save bits\nof time here and there, add it up,"},"104":{"dur":2,"text":"we will finally get\nto everything

now water\nall over her basement."},"160":{"dur":2,"text":"If you've ever had anything\nlike this happen to you,"},"162":{"dur":2,"text":"you know it is a hugely damaging,\nfrightening, sopping

week,"},"187":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Could you find seven hours\nto train for a triathlon?\""},"191":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Could you find seven hours\nto mentor seven worthy people?\""},"195":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm sure she would've said\nwhat most of us would've said,"},"198":{"dur":4,"text":"which is, \"No -- can't you see\nhow busy I am?\""},"203":{"dur":1,"text":"Yet when she had to find seven hours"},"205":{"dur":2,"text":"because there is water\nall over her basement,"},"208":{"dur":2,"text":"she found seven hours."},"211":{"dur":4,"text":"And what this shows us\nis that time is highly elastic."},"215":{"dur":2,"text":"We cannot make more time,"},"217":{"dur":4,"text":"but time will stretch to accommodate\nwhat we choose to put into it."},"222":{"dur":2,"text":"And so the key to time management"},"225":{"dur":2,"text":"is treating our priorities"},"227":{"dur":3,"text":"as the equivalent\nof that broken water heater."},"232":{"dur":1,"text":"To get at this,"},"233":{"dur":3,"text":"I like to use language from one\nof the busiest people I ever interviewed."},"236":{"dur":2,"text":"By busy, I mean she was running\na small business"},"239":{"dur":1,"text":"with 12 people on the payroll,"},"240":{"dur":2,"text":"she had six children in her spare time."},"242":{"dur":2,"text":"I was getting in touch with her\nto set up an interview"},"245":{"dur":2,"text":"on how she \"had it all\" -- that phrase."},"247":{"dur":1,"text":"I remember it was a Thursday morning,"},"249":{"dur":2,"text":"and she was not available\nto speak with me."},"251":{"dur":1,"text":"Of course, right?"},"252":{"dur":2,"text":"But the reason she was\nunavailable to speak with me"},"255":{"dur":1,"text":"is that she was out for a hike,"},"257":{"dur":2,"text":"because it was a beautiful spring morning,"},"259":{"dur":1,"text":"and she wanted to go for a hike."},"260":{"dur":2,"text":"So of course this makes me\neven more intrigued,"},"263":{"dur":3,"text":"and when I finally do catch up with her,\nshe explains it like this."},"266":{"dur":2,"text":"She says, \"Listen Laura, everything I do,"},"269":{"dur":3,"text":"every minute I spend, is my choice.\""},"273":{"dur":1,"text":"And rather than say,"},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"\"I don't have time to do x, y or z,\""},"277":{"dur":5,"text":"she'd say, \"I don't do x, y or z\nbecause it's not a priority.\""},"283":{"dur":4,"text":"\"I don't have time,\" often means\n\"It's not a

time;"},"305":{"dur":1,"text":"it's that I don't want to do it."},"306":{"dur":3,"text":"Using this language reminds us\nthat time is a choice."},"310":{"dur":1,"text":"And granted,"},"311":{"dur":3,"text":"there may be horrible consequences\nfor making different choices,"},"314":{"dur":1,"text":"I will give you that."},"315":{"dur":1,"text":"But we are smart

there."},"325":{"dur":1,"text":"So how do we do that?"},"327":{"dur":1,"text":"How do we treat our priorities"},"328":{"dur":2,"text":"as the equivalent\nof that broken water heater?"},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, first we need\nto figure out what they are."},"333":{"dur":2,"text":"I want to give you two strategies\nfor thinking about this."},"336":{"dur":1,"text":"The first, on the professional side:"},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm sure many people\ncoming up to the end of the year"},"340":{"dur":2,"text":"are giving or getting\nannual performance reviews."},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"You look back over\nyour successes over the year,"},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"your \"opportunities for growth.\""},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"And this serves its purpose,"},"350":{"dur":2,"text":"but I find it's more effective\nto do this looking forward."},"353":{"dur":2,"text":"So I want you to pretend\nit's the end of next year."},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"You're giving yourself\na performance review,"},"358":{"dur":4,"text":"and it has been an absolutely\namazing year for you professionally."},"364":{"dur":5,"text":"What three to five things did you do\nthat made it so amazing?"},"370":{"dur":3,"text":"So you can write next\nyear's performance review now."},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can do this\nfor your personal life, too."},"376":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm sure many of you,\nlike me, come December,"},"379":{"dur":3,"text":"get cards that contain these folded up\nsheets of colored paper,"},"383":{"dur":4,"text":"on which is written what is known\nas the family holiday letter."},"388":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"Bit of a wretched genre\nof literature, really,"},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"going on about how amazing\neveryone in the household is,"},"395":{"dur":1,"text":"or even more scintillating,"},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"how busy everyone in the household is."},"399":{"dur":1,"text":"But these letters serve a purpose,"},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"which is that they tell\nyour friends and family"},"403":{"dur":3,"text":"what you did in your personal life\nthat mattered to you over the year."},"407":{"dur":1,"text":"So this year's kind of done,"},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"but I want you to pretend\nit's the end of next year,"},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"and it has been an absolutely amazing year"},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"for you and the people you care about."},"417":{"dur":4,"text":"What three to five things did you do\nthat made it so amazing?"},"422":{"dur":4,"text":"So you can write next\nyear's family holiday letter now."},"427":{"dur":1,"text":"Don't send it."},"429":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"Please, don't send it."},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"But you can write it."},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"And now, between the performance\nreview and the family holiday letter,"},"438":{"dur":3,"text":"we have a list of six to ten goals\nwe can work on in the next year."},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"And now we need to break\nthese down into doable steps."},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"So maybe you want\nto write a family history."},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"First, you can read\nsome other family histories,"},"448":{"dur":1,"text":"get a sense for the style."},"450":{"dur":3,"text":"Then maybe think about the questions\nyou want to ask your relatives,"},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"set up appointments to interview them."},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"Or maybe you want to run a 5K."},"456":{"dur":3,"text":"So you need to find a race and sign up,\nfigure out a training plan,"},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"and dig those shoes\nout of the back of the closet."},"462":{"dur":1,"text":"And then -- this is key --"},"464":{"dur":4,"text":"we treat our priorities as the equivalent\nof that broken water heater,"},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"by putting them into our schedules first."},"471":{"dur":4,"text":"We do this by thinking through our weeks\nbefore we are in them."},"476":{"dur":3,"text":"I find a really good time to do this\nis Friday afternoons."},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"Friday afternoon is what\nan economist might call"},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"a \"low opportunity cost\" time."},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"Most of us are not sitting there\non Friday afternoons saying,"},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"\"I am excited to make progress"},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"toward my personal\nand professional priorities"},"493":{"dur":1,"text":"right now.\""},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"But we are willing to think\nabout what those should be."},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"So take a little bit\nof time Friday afternoon,"},"500":{"dur":6,"text":"make yourself a three-category priority\nlist: career, relationships, self."},"508":{"dur":3,"text":"Making a three-category list reminds us"},"511":{"dur":3,"text":"that there should be something\nin all three categories."},"515":{"dur":1,"text":"Career, we think about;"},"516":{"dur":1,"text":"relationships, self --"},"517":{"dur":1,"text":"not so much."},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"But anyway, just a short list,"},"521":{"dur":1,"text":"two to three items in each."},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"Then look out over the whole\nof the next week,"},"525":{"dur":1,"text":"and see where you can plan them in."},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"Where you plan them in is up to you."},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"I know this is going to be more\ncomplicated for some people than others."},"533":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, some people's lives\nare just harder than others."},"537":{"dur":3,"text":"It is not going to be easy\nto find time to take that poetry class"},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"if you are caring for multiple\nchildren on your own."},"544":{"dur":1,"text":"I get that."},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"And I don't want to minimize\nanyone's struggle."},"547":{"dur":4,"text":"But I do think that the numbers\nI am about to tell you are empowering."},"552":{"dur":4,"text":"There are 168 hours in a week."},"557":{"dur":4,"text":"Twenty-four times seven is 168 hours."},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"That is a lot of time."},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"If you are working a full-time\njob, so 40 hours a week,"},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"sleeping eight hours a night,\nso 56 hours a week --"},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"that leaves 72 hours for other things."},"576":{"dur":1,"text":"That is a lot of time."},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"You say you're working 50 hours a week,"},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"maybe a main job and a side hustle."},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, that leaves 62 hours\nfor other things."},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"You say you're working 60 hours."},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, that leaves 52 hours\nfor other things."},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"You say you're working more than 60 hours."},"591":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, are you sure?"},"593":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"There was once a study comparing\npeople's estimated work weeks"},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"with time diaries."},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"They found that people claiming\n75-plus-hour work weeks"},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"were off by about 25 hours."},"604":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"You can guess in which direction, right?"},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"Anyway, in 168 hours a week,"},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"I think we can find time\nfor what matters to you."},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"If you want to spend\nmore time with your kids,"},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"you want to study more\nfor a test you're taking,"},"619":{"dur":3,"text":"you want to exercise for three hours\nand volunteer for two,"},"622":{"dur":1,"text":"you can."},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's even if you're working\nway more than full-time hours."},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"So we have plenty of time, which is great,"},"629":{"dur":1,"text":"because guess what?"},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"We don't even need that much\ntime to do amazing things."},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"But when most of us have\nbits of time, what do we do?"},"637":{"dur":1,"text":"Pull out the phone, right?"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"Start deleting emails."},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"Otherwise, we're puttering\naround the house"},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"or watching TV."},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"But small moments can have great power."},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"You can use your bits of time"},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"for bits of joy."},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe it's choosing to read\nsomething wonderful on the bus"},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"on the way to work."},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"I know when I had a job\nthat required two bus rides"},"661":{"dur":1,"text":"and a subway ride every morning,"},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"I used to go to the library\non weekends to get stuff to read."},"666":{"dur":4,"text":"It made the whole experience\nalmost, almost,
