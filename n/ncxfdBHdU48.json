point"},"275":{"dur":1,"text":"where we have to\n   take a deep breath"},"276":{"dur":1,"text":"and with the fiscal outlook say"},"278":{"dur":1,"text":"we can't afford\n   to spend as much."},"280":{"dur":1,"text":"As has often been said,"},"281":{"dur":2,"text":"the golden goose is\n  laying smaller eggs."},"283":{"dur":1,"text":"And we need to\n  take a look at that"},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"and just be a little more\n   fiscally responsible."},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"- But this really\nwasn't unexpected either"},"289":{"dur":1,"text":"because it is commodities."},"291":{"dur":1,"text":"Commodities go up and down.\n  - [Kim] Absolutely."},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"And when I say the\n   legislature was involved,"},"294":{"dur":2,"text":"you know, I had a very\ninteresting conversation"},"296":{"dur":2,"text":"a few years, or I guess it's\n  about two years ago now,"},"299":{"dur":4,"text":"with a group of oil industry\n  executives and scientists,"},"303":{"dur":2,"text":"was asking them about fracking\n and all that sort of thing."},"305":{"dur":2,"text":"And one of the chief\n  engineer, in fact,"},"308":{"dur":3,"text":"from the largest companies,\n largest players in the Bakken,"},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"was explaining it to me\n   the more detailed science"},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"of how fracking works."},"315":{"dur":1,"text":"And then he stopped and\nhe asked me a question."},"316":{"dur":1,"text":"And he said, \"How long have\n  you been in the legislature?"},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"And I said, \"Well, I\n was elected in 1994.\""},"320":{"dur":1,"text":"He said, \"Do you remember\n   the '95 session?\""},"322":{"dur":1,"text":"I said, \"Well, yeah, I remember."},"324":{"dur":1,"text":"\"It was my freshman session.\""},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"And he said, \"Do you remember\n what you did to the oil tax?\""},"327":{"dur":1,"text":"I said, \"Yeah, I remember\n  we tweaked it a little bit.\""},"329":{"dur":1,"text":"He said, \"Well, let me\n tell you the story.\""},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"He said, \"We had this idea\n   for how we could do this,"},"333":{"dur":2,"text":"\"try this fracking\n   to extract oil"},"335":{"dur":1,"text":"\"out of this rock,\n   this shale rock."},"337":{"dur":1,"text":"\"We didn't know\n   if it would work."},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"\"It had not been\ntried, really, anywhere"},"341":{"dur":1,"text":"\"the way we wanted\n   to do it here.\""},"342":{"dur":1,"text":"Fracking had been around,\n   but not that formula,"},"344":{"dur":1,"text":"not that way of doing it."},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"And he said, \"We came to the\n  legislature and we asked you"},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"\"if you would tweak your tax\n  structure just a little bit"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"\"to allow us to\n   afford to try this"},"353":{"dur":2,"text":"\"because couldn't afford\n  to the way your taxes were."},"356":{"dur":1,"text":"\"And you said yes.\""},"357":{"dur":1,"text":"And the next words\n   out of his mouth"},"359":{"dur":1,"text":"are forever\n ingrained in my mind."},"361":{"dur":1,"text":"He said, \"If it were\n  not for the fact"},"362":{"dur":3,"text":"\"that North Dakota has a\n business friendly legislature,"},"366":{"dur":1,"text":"\"there would be no\n   Bakken oil boom.\""},"368":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's a fairly\n  profound statement."},"370":{"dur":2,"text":"So I believe that good\n public policy says"},"372":{"dur":1,"text":"this is a precious resource."},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"It's one that we are guardians\n of to a certain degree"},"376":{"dur":2,"text":"with being the elected\n representatives of the people."},"378":{"dur":3,"text":"At the same time, we\n need to do what we can"},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"to help business thrive\nand to be responsible."},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think that's\n   to a great extent,"},"386":{"dur":1,"text":"from the people\n   who are involved,"},"388":{"dur":1,"text":"what's responsible\n   for the oil boom."},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, what you just said is true."},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not unexpected because\n  we know things ebb and flow."},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"We know a commodity\nprice goes up and down."},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's important to note, as\n our majority leader has said,"},"400":{"dur":1,"text":"that the sky is not falling."},"401":{"dur":1,"text":"We are in good shape\n  in North Dakota."},"402":{"dur":1,"text":"In fact, one of the things"},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"that I think is\n   rather interesting"},"405":{"dur":1,"text":"is there are two things that"},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"when we get into the\n political realm particularly,"},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"that the minority\n  party has criticized"},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"the legislature for\n in the last few years."},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"One is the idea\n   of hoarding money."},"417":{"dur":1,"text":"You have all these\n   pots of money,"},"418":{"dur":0,"text":"and you're putting money away."},"419":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, some are constitutional."},"420":{"dur":1,"text":"We can't touch them anyway."},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"But to the extent that\nwe have been responsible"},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"with the people's money"},"425":{"dur":1,"text":"and the tax dollars\n  we collect from oil"},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"and set some of those\n aside for a rainy day,"},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"it's precisely because\n   of what you talked about."},"432":{"dur":1,"text":"These things ebb and flow."},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"And this session would\n be a lot different"},"435":{"dur":1,"text":"if we didn't have some\n of those resources"},"436":{"dur":1,"text":"to fall back on."},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"So I think that's\n   very responsible."},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"The other thing is we need\n   to look at the oil tax."},"442":{"dur":1,"text":"Now is probably not\n  the time to do it"},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"because of the\n   volatility of the market."},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"But last session, the\n   Senate looked at an issue"},"449":{"dur":3,"text":"of possibly dealing with the\n way we tax oil in North Dakota"},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"and what we call the triggers"},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"and whether that's good\npublic policy or not."},"456":{"dur":1,"text":"Now we're in the throes of that,"},"458":{"dur":3,"text":"so we're not gonna, you know,\n try to do that midstream."},"461":{"dur":1,"text":"But we should look at that"},"462":{"dur":1,"text":"and say what's good\n  for the long term"},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"as this ebbs and flows."},"466":{"dur":1,"text":"What's best of the oil industry,"},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"for those who own\n   mineral rights,"},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"what's best for the public"},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"and the state coffers\n as go forward."},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Dave] And I haven't\nseen a study resolution"},"474":{"dur":1,"text":"specifically on that topic."},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"But I have a feeling that\n   this is going to be part"},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"of your two-year\ninterim studies."},"481":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Kim] I would\n   be, David, I'd be"},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"very surprised if it's not."},"484":{"dur":1,"text":"- Since we're talking\nabout some of the things"},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"that have happened\n   with the oil boom,"},"488":{"dur":1,"text":"one of the things\n   that has happened"},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"is a little bit more\n  of a downside thing."},"491":{"dur":1,"text":"That's the whole issue\n of human trafficking."},"493":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Kim] Yes."},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"- And legislators from\nboth sides of the aisle,"},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"both the House and Senate\n and Republicans and Democrats"},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"have really attacked this issue."},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"And you're part of that because\nyour committee looks at it."},"504":{"dur":1,"text":"You're on some of the bills."},"505":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Kim] Absolutely."},"506":{"dur":1,"text":"- To deal with\n   human trafficking."},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"Where are we at now\n  in terms of getting"},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"a more comprehensive policy?"},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"- Well, Dave, I'm glad\n you brought that up"},"514":{"dur":1,"text":"because if you were to ask me"},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"what's been the defining issue"},"518":{"dur":1,"text":"or one of the two\n  or three top issues"},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"that our committee\n   has dealt with"},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"in this session, I\n   would have to say"},"523":{"dur":1,"text":"that it is the human\n  trafficking issue."},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"And we have a package\n of bills right now"},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"in the Judiciary Committee,"},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"we've had all the hearings."},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"We've acted on a couple of them."},"532":{"dur":1,"text":"And we'll be acting\n  on the others"},"533":{"dur":1,"text":"within the next week or two."},"535":{"dur":1,"text":"And they're all bills that deal"},"537":{"dur":3,"text":"with this tremendously\n troubling issue."},"541":{"dur":1,"text":"What we're finding\n   in North Dakota"},"542":{"dur":2,"text":"is that human traffickers\n   around the country"},"544":{"dur":1,"text":"are targeting North Dakota."},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"And you could argue that's\n because there's a market there"},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"because of the oil boom."},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"A lot of people from a lot\n  of places around the country"},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"are coming to North Dakota\n   to find jobs and so on."},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's all good."},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"But with it comes the\n seedier side of life."},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"And our concern is\n  if women are being,"},"562":{"dur":1,"text":"it's not always women."},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't mean to, you know,\n   base it only on gender,"},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"but I would say it's fair to say"},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"the predominance of people,"},"569":{"dur":1,"text":"the predominant number of people"},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"that are caught up in\nthis are probably women."},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"When they're human trafficked,"},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"and we think first\n   of prostitution,"},"576":{"dur":1,"text":"but there's other types\nof human trafficking."},"578":{"dur":4,"text":"You know, there's issues\n  of labor human trafficking."},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"Sometimes these people\n   are forced to get involved"},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"in other types of crimes,\n   like forgery and theft"},"587":{"dur":3,"text":"and various things\n   in order to obey,"},"590":{"dur":1,"text":"if you will, what their\n traffickers are telling them."},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"So we've got a number of bills"},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"that deal with a lot of\nthese ancillary issues."},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"And I would be very surprised\n if they don't all pass,"},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"and probably even\nsurprised if they don't"},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"all pass unanimously\n out of our committee."},"603":{"dur":1,"text":"- So in looking at this issue,"},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"what has been the most\n eye opening for you"},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"and might be eye\n opening for the people"},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"listening to this program?"},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"- Well, some of the\n national news programs"},"613":{"dur":3,"text":"have, in recent months and\n years, in the last year or two"},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"actually had some\n stories on this issue."},"619":{"dur":3,"text":"I think one of the issues that\n maybe surprises some people"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"is that many of the young\n   women who are caught up"},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"as particularly with\nrespect to prostitution"},"627":{"dur":3,"text":"and human trafficking\n are victimized in ways"},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"that we had never dreamt before."},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"And they are, you know,\n   they're caught up in this"},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"because in some\n  cases it's virtually"},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"kidnapping that's involved,"},"640":{"dur":1,"text":"where people are just snatched"},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"and they're taken into this\n  situation of servitude."},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"And they're forced\n  to do various things"},"646":{"dur":1,"text":"for the people who control them."},"648":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I think the\n  approach that's being taken"},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"is to say most\n  often these people,"},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"especially the minors that\n   are involved, are victims."},"657":{"dur":1,"text":"They're not criminals,\n they're victims."},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, would I say that every\n  prostitute is a victim?"},"662":{"dur":3,"text":"No, but I think we want to\n  focus on the vast majority,"},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"particularly those that\nare minors that may be."},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"And we want to go\n after the traffickers,"},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"make sure we have good tools\n  in place to catch them,"},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"to charge them with the\n crimes that they've committed,"},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"and to convict them."},"678":{"dur":1,"text":"And then we want to\n make sure that we get"},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"the young victims into\n   programs that'll help them"},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"and get them back into\n a productive life."},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"- So you've got the\n Safe Harbor law, too."},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Kim] We do, indeed."},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Dave] And is that\n  out of committee?"},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"- We voted that out of\n committee yesterday."},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was, I know this is\nbeing taped for later broadcast."},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"We voted it out of\n  committee Wednesday."},"695":{"dur":3,"text":"And that was a unanimous\nvote out of committee."},"699":{"dur":1,"text":"Different amendments\n  were considered."},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"We adopted a couple, but nothing"},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"that changes it substantively."},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"- I'd be remiss if I didn't ask."},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"There seemed to be one bump,"},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"at least in some quarters this"},"710":{"dur":3,"text":"what was described as\nthe gag part of a bill."},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"Can you explain what that was?"},"717":{"dur":3,"text":"- Yeah, in the Senate, there\n  was an amendment adopted."},"720":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is on the, probably\n  what most would consider"},"723":{"dur":1,"text":"the major human\n   trafficking bill."},"725":{"dur":3,"text":"It's the bill that the Uniform\n Law Commission came up with."},"728":{"dur":1,"text":"And many states\n  are considering it."},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"But to understand, a\nuniform law doesn't
