through fixing a form."},"477":{"dur":3,"text":"And the coalition\nachieved $156 million"},"480":{"dur":4,"text":"in compliance cost savings by\nlooking at a simplified

entities"},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"that actually ended up\npaying for the mining tax."},"591":{"dur":4,"text":"There were 125 entities who had\nto go through the compliance"},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"process of showing that\nthey did not have to pay,"},"599":{"dur":5,"text":"and we calculated that those\norganisations were
