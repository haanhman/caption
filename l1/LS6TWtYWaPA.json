to therefore assume\nthat it's for the 1%, the foodie elites,"},"61":{"dur":2,"text":"the rich people, not for ordinary people."},"63":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, that's actually not correct logic,\nand I will show why in a second."},"67":{"dur":3,"text":"It also leads us to assume\nthat if organic food is expensive,"},"70":{"dur":3,"text":"organic farming must be more expensive,\nwhich then leads to wonder,"},"74":{"dur":2,"text":"surely, it can't feed the world,"},"77":{"dur":4,"text":"and back to concluding\nthat it's only for the 1%."},"81":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, those assumptions\nactually are wrong as well."},"84":{"dur":3,"text":"The idea that organic food\nis only for the rich,"},"87":{"dur":2,"text":"only for the 1% is a powerful one,"},"90":{"dur":4,"text":"with huge implications\non both business and policy."},"94":{"dur":2,"text":"And we need both business innovation"},"97":{"dur":3,"text":"and policy change in this country\nto support

organic food is not just for the 1%,"},"119":{"dur":3,"text":"it's for everybody,\nit's for ordinary Americans."},"122":{"dur":3,"text":"And the first step in that change\nis to change that perception."},"126":{"dur":3,"text":"So, who is buying\nthis expensive organic food?"},"129":{"dur":2,"text":"Who in America is buying it?"},"131":{"dur":3,"text":"According to Nielsen and NMI research,"},"134":{"dur":3,"text":"three out of every four Americans\nhave consciously chosen"},"137":{"dur":2,"text":"to buy organic food in the past year."},"140":{"dur":3,"text":"Some of them might have only bought\na single organic product,"},"143":{"dur":4,"text":"but there is a subset that there are\nthe so-called devoted organic shoppers,"},"147":{"dur":4,"text":"that represent the vast

Americans."},"159":{"dur":2,"text":"Now let's look at these elite foodies."},"161":{"dur":2,"text":"What does the elite foodie look like?"},"164":{"dur":2,"text":"Two out of five of them have\nan annual household income"},"167":{"dur":1,"text":"of less than 50,000 dollars."},"168":{"dur":2,"text":"One out of five has\nan annual household income"},"170":{"dur":2,"text":"of less than 30,000

out of four Americans,"},"212":{"dur":3,"text":"and they're already buying organic\nin spite of how expensive it is."},"216":{"dur":3,"text":"Just imagine how many more Americans\nwould be buying organic food"},"219":{"dur":2,"text":"if it wasn't so damn expensive."},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, we actually know\nsome of the answers to that."},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"Walmart asked its consumers"},"227":{"dur":4,"text":"and found that 91% of them\nwould be buying organic."},"231":{"dur":3,"text":"So, why is organic food so darn expensive?"},"234":{"dur":4,"text":"It must be because organic farming\nis more expensive, right?"},"238":{"dur":2,"text":"Not true; organic farming\nactually saves a ton of money"},"241":{"dur":2,"text":"on a lot of very expensive inputs."},"243":{"dur":2,"text":"Fossil fuel is expensive."},"245":{"dur":2,"text":"Fertilizers are incredibly expensive."},"247":{"dur":3,"text":"The chemicals, the antibiotics\nthat are used by factory farms."},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"These things are very expensive."},"254":{"dur":1,"text":"Not just their externalized costs,"},"255":{"dur":2,"text":"but their actual dollar\ncosts are very high."},"258":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, so maybe organic farming saves money\nbut perhaps it produces less food."},"263":{"dur":1,"text":"That's not necessarily true either."},"265":{"dur":3,"text":"This is not a blanket statement,\nit varies by crop and region,"},"269":{"dur":2,"text":"but there are lot of ways\nin which, when done right,"},"272":{"dur":3,"text":"organic sustainable farming\ncan produce more food."},"276":{"dur":3,"text":"One part of that is crop\nand livestock rotations,"},"279":{"dur":3,"text":"so that nutrients\nare recycled into the soil."},"282":{"dur":5,"text":"Growing multiple crops at the same time,\nincreasing the revenue of the land."},"287":{"dur":1,"text":"Exploiting natural synergies."},"289":{"dur":3,"text":"One of my favorites examples\nof this is sheep and asparagus."},"293":{"dur":4,"text":"Sheep love to graze but they do not like\nthe taste of asparagus."},"297":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, when the asparagus farmer\nhas a weed problem,"},"302":{"dur":1,"text":"rather than spending a lot of money"},"303":{"dur":2,"text":"buying a chemical herbicide\nto spray in the fields,"},"306":{"dur":2,"text":"they can invite in a sheep farmer."},"308":{"dur":2,"text":"The sheep will clear the weeds."},"311":{"dur":4,"text":"The sheep farmer gets free pasture\nfor his or her animals,"},"315":{"dur":3,"text":"and the asparagus farmer\ngets free weed control."},"319":{"dur":3,"text":"And, the sheep add fertility to the soil."},"322":{"dur":1,"text":"You must be thinking: \"Well, great,"},"324":{"dur":2,"text":"but industrial agriculture,\nfor all of its ills,"},"326":{"dur":3,"text":"surely at least the one thing it has\nis that it's more efficient, right?\""},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"I would say that it has\nthe illusion of efficiency,"},"333":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's a short-lived one."},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"For example, think about the topsoil."},"337":{"dur":1,"text":"America's topsoil,"},"339":{"dur":3,"text":"perhaps the single, greatest\nnational treasure this country possesses,"},"343":{"dur":4,"text":"this rich topsoil, is like a bank account\nthat we're drawing on every year."},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"Withdrawing money\nand not putting it back in."},"350":{"dur":2,"text":"That's not efficient."},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"It's inefficient and unsustainable."},"354":{"dur":2,"text":"Similarly, the way we treat nutrients."},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"Nutrients are supposed\nto come from the soil,"},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"go through the body of a plant,\ninto the body of an animal,"},"361":{"dur":1,"text":"and back into the soil."},"363":{"dur":1,"text":"We all learned that in high school."},"364":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's not how the vast majority of\nNorth American agriculture works today."},"368":{"dur":4,"text":"Instead, we're mining minerals in Morroco,\nshipping them across the Atlantic,"},"373":{"dur":1,"text":"spraying them on the fields,"},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"only to have them wash off\ninto the waterways,"},"377":{"dur":3,"text":"and end up in dead zones,\nand places like the Gulf of Mexico."},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"That's not efficient,\nit's incredibly wasteful."},"383":{"dur":3,"text":"Not just ecologically, but economically."},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"Similarly, what I said earlier\nabout fossil fuels,"},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"antibiotics to feed\nthe factory farm animals."},"392":{"dur":4,"text":"And all of this to increase\nthe yield of corn and soy."},"397":{"dur":3,"text":"Crops that humans don't even actually eat."},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"We're maximizing\nthe yield per acre of corn and soy,"},"403":{"dur":4,"text":"yet the vast majority of American farmland\ndoes not feed humans."},"408":{"dur":4,"text":"It's either used to create ethanol\nor to feed livestock."},"413":{"dur":3,"text":"About less than 10%\nof the corn crop in this country"},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"actually goes to feed humans."},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"This is the system\nthat is supposed to feed the world?"},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, it's actually\nnot feeding the world today."},"425":{"dur":3,"text":"If you measure, the right way\nto measure productivity in agriculture"},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"is not the yield of corn per acre\nor soy per acre,"},"431":{"dur":3,"text":"but the yield of human food per acre."},"434":{"dur":4,"text":"And when you measure how much\nhuman food is produced per acre,"},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"America is not a leader."},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"We're not even average."},"441":{"dur":1,"text":"We're behind the world average,"},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"and we're behind countries\nlike India and China,"},"445":{"dur":4,"text":"that are making a much better job of\nfeeding the world population than we are."},"450":{"dur":4,"text":"So, if you were smart, you would realize\nwhat's really behind that status"},"455":{"dur":4,"text":"is the fact that these other countries\nconsume less meat that America does."},"459":{"dur":4,"text":"And, so, who is going to produce all\nthe increasing appetite for pork in China,"},"464":{"dur":4,"text":"And surely, American industrial\nagriculture and factory farms"},"468":{"dur":3,"text":"are going to step forward\nto supply all the meat."},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, I'm not sure that's true either."},"474":{"dur":4,"text":"The leading exporter of pork\nin the world today is Denmark."},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"Denmark is a country\nthat has for many years banned"},"481":{"dur":3,"text":"the use of sub-therapeutic\nantibiotics in livestock."},"484":{"dur":4,"text":"One of the most disgusting and reckless\npractices of American factory farms"},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"has been banned in Denmark,"},"490":{"dur":4,"text":"yet Denmark has continued to maintain\nhigh yields and low prices for their pork,"},"495":{"dur":4,"text":"and is the number one exporter\nof pork to places like China."},"499":{"dur":3,"text":"Ironically, China has\nrecently banned pork imports"},"503":{"dur":4,"text":"from several U.S. pork producers\nbecause of the use of antibiotics."},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"The real question though is:"},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"What's the most efficient way\nto produce food"},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"if people are going to eat more meat?"},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, if you look at one acre of corn,"},"516":{"dur":3,"text":"it can produce about enough corn\nto feed one head of cattle."},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"This is an approximation,\nthis is not very exact math."},"522":{"dur":4,"text":"That same acre-I wouldn't advocate\nplanting organic corn to feed the cattle -"},"527":{"dur":6,"text":"that same acre can produce about\nenough grass to feed one head of cattle."},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, it's not an exact math."},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm approximating,"},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"and there is a lot of other things\nthat change the equation."},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"Corn is a more efficient crop\nin a lot of ways."},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a wonderful crop,\nit allows for a lot more control,"},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"it has less seasonality,"},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"but it also has a lot of other costs\non the balance sheet."},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"At the end of the day,\nit's not a slam dunk"},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"that industrial agriculture is\nmore efficient, even for producing meat."},"557":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, the truly more efficient way\nto feed humans is to use that land"},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"to produce crops that people eat,"},"565":{"dur":3,"text":"like fruits, vegetables, wheat or rice."},"568":{"dur":3,"text":"But the benefit of growing\nmeat on pasture"},"571":{"dur":3,"text":"is at least those animals\nfertilize the land,"},"575":{"dur":4,"text":"and if you do a rotation between\nthose animals and fruits and vegetables,"},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"you can actually produce\nmore off that same land."},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"It must be about the money then, right?"},"584":{"dur":4,"text":"These so called evil corporations\nlike McDonald's and Monsanto."},"588":{"dur":3,"text":"Perhaps they are shoving\nthis industrial food down our throats"},"591":{"dur":1,"text":"because it's more profitable, right?"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, that's actually not true either."},"595":{"dur":4,"text":"In fact, using the techniques\nI just described, Farmland LP,"},"600":{"dur":1,"text":"- which I'm a very large investor in -"},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"converts farms\nfrom conventional crops to organic,"},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"and significantly increases their profits."},"608":{"dur":4,"text":"They've done a cohort analysis of farmland"},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"that they've been progressively\nconverting to organic,"},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"and in doing so, significantly\nraising the income from the land,"},"618":{"dur":4,"text":"from something like 100 dollars\nto 450 dollars per acre."},"623":{"dur":4,"text":"You might think: \"Well, that's great\nbut perhaps it can't scale.\""},"627":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, the answer is actually organic\nand sustainable agriculture is scaling."},"632":{"dur":1,"text":"For one thing, Chipotle,"},"633":{"dur":3,"text":"which is the closest we have\nto a fast food organic company,"},"636":{"dur":3,"text":"is the single fastest growing\nfast-food company of the past decade."},"640":{"dur":4,"text":"And, more broadly, organic cropland\nin the U.S. has grown tremendously,"},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"more than tripling\nin less than two decades."},"647":{"dur":3,"text":"So, organic saves money,\nis less expensive,"},"651":{"dur":5,"text":"can produce as much or more food,\nis more profitable, and is scaling."},"657":{"dur":6,"text":"Then, what the... why the heck\nis organic food so expensive?"},"663":{"dur":5,"text":"And the answer is because the demand\nfor organic food is growing even faster."},"668":{"dur":4,"text":"That graph of organic cropland growing\nis still a drop in the bucket,"},"673":{"dur":3,"text":"and it pales compared\nto the surge in demand"},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"for organic sustainable food\nin this country."},"678":{"dur":3,"text":"The total amount\nof organic cropland in America"},"682":{"dur":3,"text":"is about 1% of this country's\nagricultural land."},"685":{"dur":2,"text":"The total amount\nof consumption of organic food"},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"is between 4 and 5%,"},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"and that does not even\nreflect the total demand."},"692":{"dur":3,"text":"That's how much has actually\nbeen consumed."},"695":{"dur":4,"text":"One out of every four Americans\nis a devoted organic shopper,"},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"and 91% of Walmart customers say"},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"they would be interested\nin buying organic food."},"705":{"dur":3,"text":"The demand that we need\nto satisfy is not just that 5%."},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"But you might wonder\nwhere is that 4 or 5%"},"710":{"dur":4,"text":"of organic food coming from\nif not from our cropland?"},"714":{"dur":1,"text":"It's being imported."},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"And where is organic food\ngrowing on this planet?"},"719":{"dur":1,"text":"In developing countries."},"720":{"dur":4,"text":"80% of the certified organic farmers\nare in developing countries."},"725":{"dur":3,"text":"The country with the most\norganic farmers is actually India."},"728":{"dur":5,"text":"So, the poor countries\nof the world are feeding the food"},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"that the majority\nof want to eat."},"737":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I think America should stop worrying\nso much about feeding the world,"},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"and focus a little bit more\non feeding itself."},"743":{"dur":3,"text":"The solution to this\nis actually relatively simple."},"746":{"dur":4,"text":"We need organic sustainably\nmanaged cropland in this country"},"750":{"dur":4,"text":"to increase dramatically,\nto catch up with the enormous demand."},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"I put my own money where my mouth is,"},"757":{"dur":3,"text":"and I've invested a lot of money\nin Farmland LP as I mentioned,"},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"which is converting land to organic,"},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"and I think we need both policy change,\nand more business innovation"},"765":{"dur":4,"text":"to accelerate the expansion of sustainable\norganic
