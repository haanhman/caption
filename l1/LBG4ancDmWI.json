two."},"488":{"dur":12,"text":"And I\u00edm going to work a second cluster into\nthis same corner."},"500":{"dur":9,"text":"Okay."},"510":{"dur":4,"text":"So I have two clusters of three double

crochet,\nis when you have to really watch where you\u00edre"},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"putting your hook into the work."},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"And you just don\u00edt with granny squares."},"640":{"dur":2,"text":"Chain two."},"642":{"dur":4,"text":"Work my second cluster."},"647":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay."},"651":{"dur":8,"text":"I\u00edm going to chain one here, because I\u00edm\ntraveling over to this one."},"660":{"dur":4,"text":"And just like we did with the first round,\nI need to connect this side to this side."},"664":{"dur":7,"text":"So I count up one, two, three, and slip stitch\ninto that stitch to connect them."},"672":{"dur":3,"text":"Now let me straighten this out so we can take\na look."},"675":{"dur":3,"text":"I should have four distinct corners."},"679":{"dur":8,"text":"With a chain one gap between each one."},"687":{"dur":7,"text":"Next up in round three, I\u00edm going to show\nyou how to change colors."},"695":{"dur":7,"text":"Okay, hopefully you\u00edve caught up with finishing\nthat round."},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"We\u00edre going to move on to the third round,\nand change colors this time."},"705":{"dur":3,"text":"Let\u00eds go ahead and take a look."},"709":{"dur":4,"text":"This is exactly where we left off in the last\nvideo, I have this one loop left here."},"713":{"dur":4,"text":"And all I\u00edm going to do is just break the\nyarn, and pull that through, just like how"},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"we fasten off in knitting."},"720":{"dur":6,"text":"Now, last time, we had to travel with slip\nstitches over to get to the next gap."},"726":{"dur":3,"text":"When you change colors you don\u00edt have to\ndo that."},"730":{"dur":3,"text":"Umm, I apologize for the colors here."},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"I guess it\u00eds kind of christmasey looking."},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"[laughs]"},"736":{"dur":3,"text":"But, it should be easy to see, at least!"},"740":{"dur":1,"text":"I am going to start in a corner."},"741":{"dur":1,"text":"Because I always start a new color in a corner."},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"You can start in a side gap if you like."},"745":{"dur":4,"text":"But I am going to stab into a corner, and\njust like when I\u00edm attaching new yarn when"},"749":{"dur":4,"text":"I\u00edm knitting, I\u00edm going to fold the yarn\nover, leaving myself about a six inch tail,"},"754":{"dur":4,"text":"and make a loop, put that on the hook and\npull up a loop."},"758":{"dur":1,"text":"Now to get started we\u00edre going to chain three."},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"To get started with double crochet I want\nto chain three."},"763":{"dur":5,"text":"The one thing that I like to do to help secure\nthe tail end is I hold both strands together"},"769":{"dur":4,"text":"for the chain three."},"773":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay."},"778":{"dur":5,"text":"So my end is kind of\u00d6uhh, It\u00eds probably\npretty much woven in there."},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"I might want to weave it in a little bit more,\nbut it\u00eds pretty much woven in."},"786":{"dur":3,"text":"Now I\u00edm going to work two clusters of three\ndouble crochet in this corner."},"790":{"dur":1,"text":"Anyway, that\u00eds the way to change colors."},"792":{"dur":4,"text":"You really just start working with it, and\nchain up."},"796":{"dur":4,"text":"Oh, this yarn is so much smoother than the\nred yarn!"},"800":{"dur":5,"text":"So again, just like with the other corners,\nthe chain three that I did counts as double"},"805":{"dur":6,"text":"crochet, I\u00edm did two more, I\u00edm going to\nchain two \u00f1 I\u00edm sorry, I\u00edm going to chain"},"812":{"dur":1,"text":"one."},"813":{"dur":5,"text":"Because I\u00edm going to travel over to this\nside gap here."},"818":{"dur":4,"text":"And I\u00edm going to work one cluster of double\ncrochets in this side gap."},"823":{"dur":3,"text":"This is where it starts to get a little bit\ndifferent."},"826":{"dur":2,"text":"Because the sides are becoming longer."},"829":{"dur":1,"text":"So not everything is a corner anymore."},"830":{"dur":3,"text":"It will be clear here in just a minute."},"834":{"dur":5,"text":"So I\u00edm going to chain one to travel over\nhere."},"840":{"dur":10,"text":"To work two double crochet clusters in this\ncorner."},"850":{"dur":7,"text":"And after I get these worked, I will go over\nagain how the pattern is emerging here."},"858":{"dur":21,"text":"Here\u00eds one, I\u00edm going to chain two, because\nit\u00eds a corner."},"879":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay, let\u00eds talk about what we just did."},"881":{"dur":1,"text":"Whoops!"},"882":{"dur":2,"text":"I only worked one over here in this corner!"},"884":{"dur":1,"text":"I need a second one!"},"886":{"dur":1,"text":"But I can catch it on the way over."},"887":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, let\u00eds just look at the part I did here."},"890":{"dur":1,"text":"[laughs]"},"891":{"dur":5,"text":"We have two clusters of double crochets here,\nbecause it\u00eds a corner."},"896":{"dur":2,"text":"We have just one cluster here, because it\u00eds\na side."},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"And I\u00edm going to work a second one here."},"901":{"dur":4,"text":"If I had been thinking about it, I would have\nworked the second one while I was there, but"},"905":{"dur":4,"text":"since it\u00eds the beginning of the row, I can\njust work it in there when I get all the way"},"910":{"dur":1,"text":"around the whole side."},"912":{"dur":4,"text":"So now, as I go over to this side, I have\nthis side gap here, where I\u00edm going to work"},"916":{"dur":1,"text":"one double crochet cluster."},"918":{"dur":2,"text":"And I have the corner, where I\u00edm going to\nwork two."},"920":{"dur":5,"text":"When I\u00edm traveling from one gap to the next,\nI chain one between."},"926":{"dur":6,"text":"So I\u00edm going to chain one, one double crochet\ncluster, chain one, and then a double crochet"},"932":{"dur":4,"text":"cluster here, chain two, a second double crochet\ncluster in here."},"936":{"dur":3,"text":"Let\u00eds actually do it."},"940":{"dur":5,"text":"Chain one."},"945":{"dur":5,"text":"One cluster of three double crochets."},"950":{"dur":1,"text":"I should have been working with this yarn\nall along!"},"952":{"dur":1,"text":"It is so smooth!"},"953":{"dur":4,"text":"It has baby alpaca in it."},"957":{"dur":1,"text":"Chain one."},"958":{"dur":15,"text":"To travel over to this gap."},"974":{"dur":22,"text":"Chain two after the first cluster."},"997":{"dur":1,"text":"And there you have it."},"998":{"dur":4,"text":"You continue that around for this whole round."},"1003":{"dur":4,"text":"And then from here on out, the only thing\nthat really changes is that you\u00edre going"},"1007":{"dur":4,"text":"to end up with more side gaps, that\u00eds what\nI call them."},"1011":{"dur":4,"text":"There is always going to be four corners,\nbut you\u00edll have more side gaps like these"},"1016":{"dur":9,"text":"here, where you\u00edll work a cluster of one\nin each one."},"1025":{"dur":4,"text":"If you follow the pattern, it will tell you\nexactly how to continue working for the other"},"1030":{"dur":1,"text":"rounds."},"1031":{"dur":12,"text":"Next up, I\u00edm going to show you how to seam\nthe granny squares together."},"1044":{"dur":4,"text":"As I mentioned at the beginning of this lesson,\nyou have the option of doing a bunch of granny"},"1048":{"dur":5,"text":"squares and seaming them together like this,\nor you can keep working around and around,"},"1054":{"dur":4,"text":"like I did here, where it\u00eds just one giant\ngranny square with no seaming."},"1059":{"dur":5,"text":"I will tell you that if you choose to do it\nthis way, you\u00edre going to need greater and"},"1064":{"dur":4,"text":"greater and greater amounts of yarn to actually\nmake it all the way around the whole thing!"},"1068":{"dur":2,"text":"[laughs] in one color."},"1071":{"dur":4,"text":"Which is one of the reasons this project is\non hold until I get a lot more of this weight"},"1075":{"dur":2,"text":"of yarn to keep working on that leftover blanket."},"1078":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, I\u00edm going to show you how to seam here."},"1081":{"dur":3,"text":"And crocheted seaming is really easy to do."},"1084":{"dur":1,"text":"Easier than mattress stitch."},"1085":{"dur":3,"text":"Let\u00eds go ahead and take a look."},"1089":{"dur":4,"text":"I have these two giant granny squares finished\nhere."},"1093":{"dur":5,"text":"And crochet isn\u00edt all that different from\nthe right side to the wrong side."},"1098":{"dur":3,"text":"But the wrong side you\u00edll have your tail\nend, hopefully sticking out on the wrong side,"},"1102":{"dur":4,"text":"and the stitches look a little flatter."},"1107":{"dur":4,"text":"Once you look at it, crochet for a while,\nit becomes easy to tell which is which."},"1111":{"dur":3,"text":"The reason I\u00edm mentioning this is because\nwe\u00edre going to seam on the wrong side of"},"1115":{"dur":1,"text":"the work."},"1116":{"dur":1,"text":"We\u00edre going to have the wrong side of the\nwork facing out."},"1118":{"dur":3,"text":"And I\u00edm actually going to turn it this way."},"1121":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, the sides of the crochet looks like a\nbind off row."},"1125":{"dur":5,"text":"With a bunch of Vs, and that\u00eds exactly how\nwe\u00edre going to be \u00f1 that\u00eds exactly what"},"1130":{"dur":2,"text":"we\u00edre going to work into as we seam."},"1133":{"dur":6,"text":"We\u00edre going to find the bottom corner over\nhere on this first one, and I\u00edm going to"},"1139":{"dur":5,"text":"work into the bottom V, or what I would call\nthe right leg of the V."},"1145":{"dur":3,"text":"I\u00edm going to stab into there."},"1148":{"dur":4,"text":"And then over here, my Vs are going this way,\nI\u00edm going to work into the top leg of the"},"1153":{"dur":1,"text":"V."},"1154":{"dur":3,"text":"So I\u00edm leaving a leg of V on the inside of\nthe work."},"1157":{"dur":1,"text":"Or on the right side of the work."},"1159":{"dur":4,"text":"So I stab into both of those, and this is\nreally just slip stitch."},"1164":{"dur":2,"text":"I\u00edm going to attach the yarn."},"1166":{"dur":3,"text":"If you were

six inch tail to weave in."},"1175":{"dur":3,"text":"Loop it around the hook, and pull it through\nboth loops."},"1178":{"dur":8,"text":"Then again, I\u00edm going to stab into the outside\nleg of the

as I seam them."},"1213":{"dur":5,"text":"And I want to show you what I\u00edm talking about\nhere, why we\u00edre grabbing the outside legs."},"1219":{"dur":3,"text":"Because it gives you this border, between\nthe squares."},"1222":{"dur":5,"text":"By leaving the leg of the V on the right side\nof the work and just grabbing the ones on"},"1227":{"dur":3,"text":"the outside, it gives you this border, which\nis really nice."},"1231":{"dur":3,"text":"If you don\u00edt want the border, you can stab\nthrough both legs of the V, and have it go"},"1234":{"dur":2,"text":"like that, but I think it looks good."},"1236":{"dur":6,"text":"Let me show you again."},"1243":{"dur":4,"text":"Stab into the outside leg, the outside leg,\ngrab the yarn, and pull it through all three"},"1248":{"dur":8,"text":"loops."},"1256":{"dur":1,"text":"You see how quickly this goes."},"1257":{"dur":9,"text":"And it\u00eds not just because I\u00edm using super\nbulky yarn, this really

that I was talking\nabout, showing up here like this."},"1283":{"dur":4,"text":"Doesn\u00edt it look good?"},"1288":{"dur":3,"text":"Now when you\u00edre seaming granny squares, I\nrecommend that you do it just like you were"},"1291":{"dur":3,"text":"seaming blocks in knitting."},"1294":{"dur":4,"text":"Seam blocks together all the way across to\nmake a long strip."},"1298":{"dur":3,"text":"And then seam the long strips together."},"1302":{"dur":6,"text":"So seam these boxes together this way, and\nthen seam the long strips together like that."},"1308":{"dur":1,"text":"And that will do it!"},"1309":{"dur":3,"text":"You\u00edre well on your way to making your granny\nsquare blanket!"},"1312":{"dur":2,"text":"Good luck."},"1315":{"dur":1,"text":"[music]"}}
