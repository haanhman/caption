steps."},"237":{"dur":4,"text":"And although five days is an\nextremely accelerated process"},"241":{"dur":1,"text":"for the delivery of a\nprosthetic, at least"},"243":{"dur":3,"text":"compared to the process here\nin Canada or in the developed"},"246":{"dur":2,"text":"world, in which it might\ntake two or three weeks."},"249":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's a much more\ncomprehensive fitting

the hospital\nwho spent time and energy"},"298":{"dur":1,"text":"developing it, it\nall goes to waste."},"300":{"dur":3,"text":"So that that's a really big\nproblem, this temporality"},"303":{"dur":3,"text":"of the prosthetic process,\nwhich needs to be thought about."},"307":{"dur":3,"text":"But the bigger issue-- and this\nis actually to some degree,"},"310":{"dur":1,"text":"to me anyway when\nI learned this,"},"312":{"dur":3,"text":"kind of surprising-- that\nprosthetic tool chain that I"},"315":{"dur":5,"text":"just described, in fact, takes\na skilled, trained, prosthetist"},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"and prosthetic\ntechnician to carry out."},"323":{"dur":4,"text":"And the problem here is that\nthe developing world lacks"},"327":{"dur":1,"text":"these people, lacks\nthese personnel."},"329":{"dur":1,"text":"In fact, the World\nHealth Organization"},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"has estimated that\nthere's a 40,000 person"},"334":{"dur":3,"text":"gap in the prosthetic, in\nthe training and skilling"},"337":{"dur":2,"text":"of prosthetists and\nprosthetic technicians."},"339":{"dur":2,"text":"And to take it even\none step further,"},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"that if they spent a\nlot of their resources"},"344":{"dur":4,"text":"over the next 50 years trying to\ndevelop these people, the best"},"348":{"dur":3,"text":"they could hope for was to\nget about 18,000 more skilled"},"351":{"dur":0,"text":"professionals."},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's this\nincommensurable gap"},"355":{"dur":3,"text":"between the need and the\nability to serve that need."},"358":{"dur":3,"text":"And really, that's where\nwe're attempting to intervene."},"362":{"dur":1,"text":"And we're attempting\nto intervene"},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"using a series of\nkind of commodity,"},"366":{"dur":1,"text":"or really, home-based\ntechnologies."},"368":{"dur":3,"text":"Now I'm gonna throw these out\nfor you guys to take a look at."},"371":{"dur":1,"text":"Go ahead."},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'll describe this\nhere in a process."},"375":{"dur":1,"text":"I want them back at the

pass them\non back up to the front."},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"That would be great."},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"Now what we're trying\nto do is basically"},"387":{"dur":4,"text":"use consumer technologies,\nreadily available technologies,"},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"to help meet this\naesthetic need."},"396":{"dur":1,"text":"I included this\nvery silly picture"},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"just because I think\nit's important to include"},"400":{"dur":1,"text":"these silly pictures."},"401":{"dur":3,"text":"Our process starts by using a\nMicrosoft Kinect like the one"},"404":{"dur":2,"text":"here in my hand, as\na 3D scanning device."},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"It's connected to a laptop\nrunning some specialized"},"409":{"dur":0,"text":"software."},"410":{"dur":3,"text":"And here on screen, you\nsee my Ph.D. student Ginger"},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"[?

well."},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"Now with MeshMixer,\nwhich has really"},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"been developed to\nsimplify and accelerate"},"457":{"dur":3,"text":"the process of manipulation\nof 3D scan data,"},"460":{"dur":3,"text":"we actually, in a\nsemi-automated way,"},"464":{"dur":6,"text":"turn the positive 3D mesh that\nI just showed you, into this,"},"470":{"dur":3,"text":"into the 3D socket that some of\nyou actually have in your hand."},"473":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm going to hold one up here\nlike the one on the screen."},"477":{"dur":5,"text":"Now this has actually both been\ngenerated from that positive 3D"},"482":{"dur":0,"text":"mesh."},"483":{"dur":3,"text":"It's also been manipulated in\nways that basically turns it"},"486":{"dur":4,"text":"into what is known as

generate."},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"So this has been\nmanipulated to create this."},"505":{"dur":5,"text":"It's then printed on a MakerBot,\nagain, a home-based technology."},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"The ones in your hand,\nthe one in my hand,"},"512":{"dur":4,"text":"is all basically the same,\nprinted from that same process."},"516":{"dur":1,"text":"It's got a fixture\non the end of it"},"518":{"dur":4,"text":"that we incorporate during\nthe development process."},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"That fixture basically\nallows us to attach it"},"524":{"dur":4,"text":"to pylon and feet, which are\nstandard issue from the Red"},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"Cross pylons and feet."},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"And the result is basically a\nprosthetic with a customized"},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"socket, standardized pylon,\nand standardized feet,"},"537":{"dur":3,"text":"which can be then fitted to\na patient in the same way"},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"as the standard process that\nthe Red Cross has currently"},"544":{"dur":1,"text":"developed."},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"Now we are about\nfour months away"},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"from testing of the\nsolution here in Canada,"},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"six to eight months away\nfrom testing in Uganda."},"552":{"dur":1,"text":"That's about our timeline."},"554":{"dur":4,"text":"But so far, it looks like\nwe're going along pretty well."},"558":{"dur":4,"text":"And the solution does provide\nsome additional capacity"},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"for hospitals like CoRSU."},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"In particular, it solves\na couple of problems."},"567":{"dur":3,"text":"One there's a lot\nless manual work"},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"involved in this production."},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's much less chance\nfor error to creep in."},"576":{"dur":4,"text":"And also, there's a lot more\ntime for these technicians"},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"to basically do\nother kinds of tasks."},"582":{"dur":4,"text":"So it reduces the labor\nnecessary to produce a socket."},"586":{"dur":3,"text":"And importantly, it also\ndramatically reduces the time."},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"So instead of five days,\nwhich is what the Red Cross"},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"standard process\ninvolves, including"},"595":{"dur":4,"text":"the drying in the\nAfrican sun, as they say,"},"599":{"dur":5,"text":"of the plaster casts,\nwe can do this process"},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"in two days, less\nthan half the time."},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that really\nresolve that time problem"},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"that we just described."},"611":{"dur":3,"text":"It also requires much\nless manual skill in order"},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"to produce it, which it solves\nthat prosthetic technician gap"},"618":{"dur":0,"text":"problem."},"619":{"dur":1,"text":"There are a number of\nissues that remain."},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"We're still working on\ncreating robust technologies,"},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"so making sure the\nMakerBot is robust,"},"626":{"dur":4,"text":"making sure the Kinect scanning\nis robust and reliable for use"},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"in contexts in the\ndeveloping world."},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"Now we are putting these\nthings into hospitals,"},"635":{"dur":2,"text":"so it's not just in any context."},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"But these are things we have\nto take into consideration."},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"We are working on making sure\nthe sockets are themselves"},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"strong enough, so\nif you squeeze it,"},"645":{"dur":1,"text":"you can see about\nhow strong it is."},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"And potentially changing the\nmaterial geometry of this"},"650":{"dur":1,"text":"object in order to\nincrease its strength."},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"We're working with mechanical\nengineering here at U of T"},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"to make that happen."},"656":{"dur":3,"text":"And again, it does reduce these\ntraining needs that I described"},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"before, but it doesn't\neliminate them altogether,"},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"which means that we\ncan't just consider"},"664":{"dur":1,"text":"this a technical\nsolution, we have"},"666":{"dur":4,"text":"to also consider a lot of social\nfactors in the kind of work"},"671":{"dur":3,"text":"that will take to implement\nand scale out this work,"},"675":{"dur":1,"text":"because that's\nultimately our goal."},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not just to create\na one-off process,"},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"but to in fact, scale\nit out globally."},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"Now if that was the\nonly story that I"},"684":{"dur":3,"text":"was going to tell you\ntoday, you might say well,"},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"I've seen this before."},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"I've seen a lot of\nsimilar stories,"},"690":{"dur":5,"text":"such as the Not Impossible\nLab's 3D prosthetics process,"},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"where they're printing\nprosthetic arms in the Sudan,"},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"or potentially also\nthe Robo-Hand project"},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"that maybe some of\nyou had seen as well."},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"And in fact, our project kind of\nfits within some of that logic"},"706":{"dur":3,"text":"is well, the idea of using\nthis emerging technology,"},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"this developing\ntechnological interventions,"},"712":{"dur":3,"text":"to basically resolve some\nkind of social issue."},"716":{"dur":1,"text":"So it fits well within that."},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"But interestingly\nenough, it's actually"},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"not much of a\ntechnical invention,"},"724":{"dur":1,"text":"or involving technical novelty."},"726":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, if you look at the\nliterature from the prosthetics"},"729":{"dur":3,"text":"and orthotics\ncontext, what you find"},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"is work being done on\ncomputer-aided design"},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"and computer-aided\nmanufacturing,"},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"it dates back to the\n1980s, the first paper"},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"being published in 1984."},"741":{"dur":1,"text":"That's a long time

is."},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"Instead, I actually\nthink it's much more"},"777":{"dur":3,"text":"an example of the value of\na kind of democratization"},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"of technology that\nwe
