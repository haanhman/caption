degree,"},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"I had developed enough tenacity"},"736":{"dur":3,"text":"to fight for entry into\na postgraduate program in psychology."},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"I then fought to

Masters,"},"783":{"dur":3,"text":"a Doctorate seemed\nlike the next logical step."},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"This time the barrier was even bigger."},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"I was told it would be impossible\nto start a Doctorate,"},"792":{"dur":4,"text":"without regular face-to-face meetings\nwith my supervisors."},"796":{"dur":4,"text":"So, my supervisors traveled\nhours out of their
