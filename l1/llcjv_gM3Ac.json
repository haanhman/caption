implicit"},"323":{"dur":1,"text":"relationship to the conflict."},"324":{"dur":3,"text":"I want to very briefly talk about those."},"328":{"dur":4,"text":"So in the long range of Russia-Ukrainian

myths,"},"475":{"dur":1,"text":"it doesn't really stand up"},"476":{"dur":3,"text":"to any kind of historical observation."},"481":{"dur":3,"text":"But from this Kievan Rus, which really did exist of course,"},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"it start as this kind of Jewish-Viking conglomerate,"},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"but eventually its rulers assimilated"},"490":{"dur":3,"text":"into the Slavonic-speaking background,"},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"took Slavonic names, spoke Slavonic languages"},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"and importantly, founded a law code"},"500":{"dur":1,"text":"in the Slavonic

Baltic of course."},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"That was what they were trying to do."},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"The Mongols were trying to establish a trade route"},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"from East Asia to

okay, I love you, forget the whole thing."},"596":{"dur":3,"text":"So the point is that this law code has some continuity"},"600":{"dur":1,"text":"into something we may not all have heard

Kiev,"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"partake in all of the things that you learned about"},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"in Western Civ if you had Western Civ"},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"and you're not too

different."},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"The history of Muscovy is a successor state,"},"637":{"dur":1,"text":"not so much of Kievan Rus,"},"639":{"dur":4,"text":"but of the Mongols themselves, of the Tatar khanate,"},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"and it does not inherit law code,"},"646":{"dur":1,"text":"et cetera, et cetera, et cetera."},"647":{"dur":1,"text":"Its history is rather different."},"648":{"dur":4,"text":"So this means that in Russian and Ukrainian history today"},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"there's a different attitude I think towards the notion"},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"of Europe, which I'm gonna characterize very brutally"},"657":{"dur":3,"text":"and that is if you're Ukrainian, Europe is not a choice."},"661":{"dur":1,"text":"You had all the nice things I mentioned."},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"You also had colonization and decolonization,"},"666":{"dur":1,"text":"which are the big European concepts"},"667":{"dur":1,"text":"of the 19th and 20 centuries."},"669":{"dur":1,"text":"Admittedly, you were colonized by Poles,"},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"which is maybe to first-class memorable colonization,"},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"but it's colonization nonetheless."},"675":{"dur":3,"text":"So the mainstream of European history is there, it's fate."},"679":{"dur":1,"text":"You can't choose if you're Ukrainian,"},"680":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm gonna be European, not European."},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"That discussion doesn't actually take place."},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"Europe good, bad maybe,"},"685":{"dur":2,"text":"but Europe no, yes, that's not a discussion."},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"In Moscow or Petersberg it's different."},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"In Moscow or Petersberg, Europe can be a mission."},"692":{"dur":0,"text":"I mean the whole idea,"},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"building Petersberg was an example of a mission."},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"From Russia, you can choose starting in the 19th century"},"699":{"dur":1,"text":"are we European or are we not."},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the classic Slavophile-Westernizer debate."},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"That's a Russian debate."},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"It doesn't make very much sense in Ukraine"},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"and the whole reason why you can choose"},"708":{"dur":1,"text":"is because you didn't have it."},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can then choose to build it up really quickly"},"712":{"dur":1,"text":"either as a modernizing Russian empire"},"714":{"dur":4,"text":"or as a Soviet Union, which is a westernizing project."},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"You can choose it, but that's a different position"},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"and so one of the things which can happen in Russia"},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"and is happening in Russia today is that you can tilt back."},"725":{"dur":1,"text":"You can say okay we're not European."},"726":{"dur":3,"text":"As Russian, so more than 80% of Ukrainians today"},"730":{"dur":1,"text":"identify as European."},"731":{"dur":1,"text":"Under 10% of Russians do."},"733":{"dur":1,"text":"Does that mean they're such different people?"},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"Not necessarily, but it does mean that in Russia"},"736":{"dur":3,"text":"you have this option of tilting back and forth."},"740":{"dur":1,"text":"The other part of history which is relevant"},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"and what I'm gonna spend a little more time talking about"},"744":{"dur":1,"text":"is the history of the Soviet Union."},"745":{"dur":3,"text":"So Russia and Ukraine have on the one hand"},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"a huge amount in common from the Soviet Union."},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"Neither Russia nor Ukraine"},"755":{"dur":3,"text":"had ever been anything like a nation state before."},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"There was a Russia Empire, but that was a multi-national"},"761":{"dur":3,"text":"conglomerate which was ruled by

Union."},"769":{"dur":4,"text":"The difference though is that from a Ukrainian point of view"},"773":{"dur":1,"text":"the universalism of the Soviet Union,"},"775":{"dur":1,"text":"and it was a universal project,"},"777":{"dur":1,"text":"resided in its pluralism."},"779":{"dur":3,"text":"The Soviet Union exists as a Soviet Union,"},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"as a nominal federation of national units"},"784":{"dur":2,"text":"because there's more than one nation in the world."},"787":{"dur":1,"text":"Ukrainians are also a nation."},"789":{"dur":1,"text":"The Ukrainians are the most important."},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"From a Russian point of view you can think"},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"the universalism of the Soviet Union resides in the fact"},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"that everybody's gonna eventually speak Russian"},"797":{"dur":1,"text":"and we're gonna have sort of one civilization"},"799":{"dur":1,"text":"circling around Moscow."},"800":{"dur":1,"text":"Those are both universal ideas,"},"802":{"dur":1,"text":"but they're different universal ideas."},"803":{"dur":1,"text":"They could exist side by side."},"805":{"dur":1,"text":"They could also clash."},"807":{"dur":1,"text":"There are also some different interpretations"},"808":{"dur":2,"text":"of events that happened inside the Soviet Union."},"811":{"dur":1,"text":"The most important of them is industrialization"},"813":{"dur":1,"text":"and collectivization,"},"814":{"dur":3,"text":"the first five-year plan of 1928 to 1933,"},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"which led to the starvation or

Russia."},"826":{"dur":2,"text":"Today in Russia, it's possible and indominant"},"828":{"dur":1,"text":"to look at these events and say yes,"},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"a lot of people suffered, there was starvation,"},"831":{"dur":3,"text":"but it was a problem in soviet development"},"835":{"dur":1,"text":"experienced by everybody."},"836":{"dur":1,"text":"Whereas from a Ukrainian point of view,"},"838":{"dur":1,"text":"the fact that a disproportionate amount of the starvation"},"839":{"dur":1,"text":"was on Ukrainian territory"},"841":{"dur":2,"text":"and that there were some deliberate policies"},"843":{"dur":4,"text":"designed to contain starvation within Ukrainian territory"},"847":{"dur":3,"text":"is remembered, it's remembered for the very simple reason"},"850":{"dur":1,"text":"that basically every family experienced it"},"852":{"dur":1,"text":"in one way or another"},"854":{"dur":2,"text":"and try as you might, the experience of starvation"},"856":{"dur":3,"text":"is something which is not that easy to push aside."},"860":{"dur":2,"text":"The final and the most important source"},"862":{"dur":2,"text":"of common memory from the Soviet period,"},"864":{"dur":2,"text":"and here now we're really getting close to our subject,"},"866":{"dur":2,"text":"is the Second World War, the Great Fatherland War"},"869":{"dur":2,"text":"as it's described in Soviet memory"},"872":{"dur":1,"text":"and in Russian-Ukrainian memory."},"874":{"dur":2,"text":"Here things get really interesting."},"876":{"dur":1,"text":"So the Great Fatherland War is a common myth."},"878":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a myth of the defensive war"},"879":{"dur":2,"text":"against a fascist invader, Nazi Germany,"},"882":{"dur":2,"text":"and their fascist allies."},"884":{"dur":1,"text":"The difference between a Russian"},"886":{"dur":3,"text":"and a Ukrainian memory though has to do with geography"},"889":{"dur":1,"text":"and now here like I'm tapping on like the weak point"},"891":{"dur":1,"text":"of all of our educations, right."},"892":{"dur":1,"text":"Like I'm not even gonna ask you to raise your hands"},"894":{"dur":1,"text":"as to whether you had geography in school."},"896":{"dur":1,"text":"Like I had Ohio geography, right,"},"897":{"dur":1,"text":"like you know where the counties are and things."},"899":{"dur":1,"text":"That's as far as it went."},"900":{"dur":2,"text":"This is really important."},"903":{"dur":2,"text":"From the geographical

for Russians,"},"940":{"dur":2,"text":"it's more of a war that happens beyond,"},"942":{"dur":1,"text":"which happens somewhere to the west,"},"944":{"dur":1,"text":"which of course means that huge

soldiers die."},"952":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't want to reduce that number, it's very important,"},"954":{"dur":2,"text":"but it's a different thing to be occupied"},"956":{"dur":1,"text":"than not to

were more likely to believe it"},"3798":{"dur":1,"text":"the closer they were to it."},"3799":{"dur":2,"text":"So by the time you got to Warsaw,"},"3802":{"dur":1,"text":"people weren't quite sure."},"3803":{"dur":1,"text":"But in the Polish-Ukrainian borderlands"},"3805":{"dur":2,"text":"everyone knew it was true because the hunger refugees"},"3807":{"dur":1,"text":"came across the

propaganda."},"3815":{"dur":3,"text":"So what I'm trying to say is that in today's Ukraine,"},"3819":{"dur":2,"text":"there is not, you can't find, well almost nobody,"},"3822":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean but people know that they've been invaded"},"3824":{"dur":0,"text":"by an outside power."},"3825":{"dur":2,"text":"They know that their family members and friends are
