Be confident.\nIn verse 28, let's begin. \"Then they led Jesus"},"504":{"dur":7,"text":"from Caiaphas to the Praetorium, and it was\nearly morning.

Therefore the Jews said to him, 'It\nis not lawful for us to put anyone to death,'"},"547":{"dur":7,"text":"that the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled\nwhich he spoke, signifying by what death he"},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"would die.\""},"557":{"dur":5,"text":"Now wouldn't you agree that it would be awfully\nintimating to stand before Roman justice,"},"563":{"dur":6,"text":"before a man who has the power of life or\ndeath with the flick of a wrist? Pontius Pilate,"},"569":{"dur":4,"text":"let me give you a thumbnail sketch: He was\nthe fifth governor of Judea. He was appointed"},"574":{"dur":9,"text":"to the post in AD 26 by Tiberius Caesar. He\nmaintained that post for ten years. Pontius"},"583":{"dur":6,"text":"Pilate was not a Roman. Did you know that?\nHe didn't come from Rome. He was Spanish."},"589":{"dur":7,"text":"He was from Seville, Spain. He became part\nof the Roman army.

And"},"638":{"dur":8,"text":"I think the text that we have before us gives\nus a hint as to why. In verse 38 when Jesus"},"647":{"dur":9,"text":"talks about the truth, it is Pilate who says\nin disgust, seemingly, \"What is truth?\" What"},"657":{"dur":7,"text":"is truth? We are dealing with a burned-out\ncynic. For Pilate, life has no answers. For"},"664":{"dur":7,"text":"Pilate, there are no absolute truths. History\ntells us he hated being in Judea. He hated"},"672":{"dur":7,"text":"the Jewish religion. And this is the one standing\nbefore Jesus Christ. As we read the story"},"679":{"dur":8,"text":"it would seem like Pilate has total control,\nhe's in charge, he's calling the shots, until"},"687":{"dur":3,"text":". . . until we get to verse 31 and verse 32."},"691":{"dur":4,"text":"These are the verses we just sort of read\nover and don't really analyze like we should."},"696":{"dur":5,"text":"But I want you to notice what it says. Pilate\nsaid, \"You take him and judge him according"},"702":{"dur":4,"text":"to your law.\" He's saying that to the Jewish\nleaders. \"Therefore the Jews said to him,"},"706":{"dur":6,"text":"'It's not lawful for us to put anyone to death,'\nthat the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled"},"713":{"dur":8,"text":"which he spoke signifying by what death he\nwould die.\" Do you remember that Jesus Christ,"},"722":{"dur":7,"text":"not only did he predict that he would die,\nbut he predicted precisely what kind of death"},"729":{"dur":6,"text":"he would die. In Mark, chapter 10, he said\nto his followers, \"We are going up to Jerusalem,"},"735":{"dur":5,"text":"and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the\nchief priests, and the teachers of the law."},"741":{"dur":4,"text":"They will condemn him to death and will hand\nhim over to the Gentiles.\""},"746":{"dur":5,"text":"Other translations say \"the Romans,\" \"who\nwill mock him, and spit on him, and flog him,"},"751":{"dur":8,"text":"and kill him.\" \"I'm going to die when the\nJewish leaders deliver me over to the Romans.\""},"760":{"dur":6,"text":"Ah, but he was more specific. He said, \"As\nMoses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness,"},"767":{"dur":7,"text":"the Son of Man must be lifted up.\" John, chapter\n12, he's even more specific. He said, \"If"},"774":{"dur":5,"text":"I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw\nall men to myself.\" John gives us a footnote:"},"780":{"dur":7,"text":"\"This he spoke, signifying by what death he\nwould die.\" You see, if he was delivered over"},"788":{"dur":4,"text":"to the Jews for them to kill him, he wouldn't\nbe lifted up, he would be thrown down. He"},"792":{"dur":6,"text":"would be stoned to death. To be lifted up\non a cross was a distinctly Roman form of"},"799":{"dur":1,"text":"execution."},"800":{"dur":6,"text":"So here's my point, this is what I don't want\nyou to miss: Pilate wasn't in control---Jesus"},"807":{"dur":7,"text":"Christ was calling all the shots. He was firmly\nin control. Remember, just hours before he"},"814":{"dur":4,"text":"had told his disciples before the Passover,\nhe said: \"You're going to go into the city."},"819":{"dur":3,"text":"You're going to meet a man carrying a pitcher\nof water.

And now this. And \"signifying by"},"845":{"dur":5,"text":"what death he would die,\" the Romans get involved."},"850":{"dur":5,"text":"No wonder Jesus stood before Pontius Pilate,\nnot like a shaking leaf, not like the cowardly"},"855":{"dur":9,"text":"lion before the Wizard of Oz, but with poise,\nwith confidence, with assurance. He was in"},"865":{"dur":7,"text":"absolute and total control of the situation.\nNow you need the same kind of confidence whenever"},"872":{"dur":5,"text":"you are face to face with an atheist or an\nagnostic, because such conversations can seem"},"878":{"dur":9,"text":"to you very intimidating. I know, some of\nyou have told me. You need to be confident,"},"887":{"dur":6,"text":"confident that God has allowed you this opportunity,\nthis conversation, this interaction, and confident"},"894":{"dur":6,"text":"that God is in control.

Notice verse 33, \"Pilate entered the\nPraetorium again, and called Jesus, and said"},"971":{"dur":8,"text":"to him, 'Are you the King of the Jews?'
