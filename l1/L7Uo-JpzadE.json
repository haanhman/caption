handle the\ndriver's licenses,"},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"because it's most\nof the population."},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"And so they said, OK,\nif that's the case,"},"324":{"dur":1,"text":"let's figure

license."},"366":{"dur":3,"text":"So the fellows decided that\nthey could fix this problem."},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"And they built-- instead\nof fixing the site,"},"371":{"dur":3,"text":"they decided just to start\nfresh with an interface that"},"374":{"dur":3,"text":"is as we like to say, simple,\nbeautiful, and easy to use."},"378":{"dur":3,"text":"And they created the\ncontent that they"},"381":{"dur":2,"text":"thought citizens needed to find."},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you type \"driver's\nlicense\" into Honolulu.gov,"},"386":{"dur":1,"text":"you get this."},"387":{"dur":1,"text":"How do you get a new license?"},"388":{"dur":3,"text":"Where you go-- where you\ngo, what you need to bring,"},"392":{"dur":1,"text":"and how you make an

started when\nthey had-- and this"},"421":{"dur":5,"text":"may sound familiar-- a $10\nbillion failure in health IT,"},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"and decided that there\nhad to be a better way."},"429":{"dur":1,"text":"So they hired a\nreally fantastic guy"},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"named Mike Bracken, who had\nbeen the head of digital"},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"for \"The Guardian\" to run it."},"435":{"dur":1,"text":"They gave him the\npower and the authority"},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"to actually do the right\nthing with technology."},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"And now over there\nin the UK, they"},"441":{"dur":3,"text":"are spending about a sixth\nof what they were before,"},"444":{"dur":1,"text":"to have more visitors\nto their site--"},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"and frankly, much\nhappier visitors."},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"They're getting the\ninformation they need."},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"But so back in Honolulu,\nyou have folks here"},"452":{"dur":3,"text":"who are creating this\ncontent and putting it"},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"into a beautiful interface."},"456":{"dur":4,"text":"But they know that they can't\ndo all of that work themselves."},"461":{"dur":3,"text":"They built the content for\nonly like the top 10 searches,"},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"that they saw on the site."},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"And then they said, we're going\nto have to have a hackathon."},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"But they didn't need\nany code written."},"471":{"dur":1,"text":"They needed content written."},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"So they held a write-a-thon."},"475":{"dur":1,"text":"This is the wall on\nthe co-working space,"},"477":{"dur":1,"text":"a couple of blocks from\nCity Hall in Honolulu,"},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"where they wrote out\nall the questions that"},"481":{"dur":5,"text":"were sort of suggested by the\nrest of the top search terms."},"486":{"dur":3,"text":"You want to pull that over here?"},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"And they invited a\nlot of the people"},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"that they'd met through\ntheir residency in Honolulu"},"493":{"dur":1,"text":"where they were going\naround and telling"},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"people what they were doing."},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"They invited workers\nfrom City Hall."},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"And they got together over\nthe course of a Saturday"},"500":{"dur":4,"text":"in the middle of 2012, and\nthese people in Honolulu"},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"got together and wrote the\nanswers to those questions."},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"They would share\nthem back and edit"},"508":{"dur":1,"text":"them, make sure they\nwere simple and clear."},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"They would run them by the\nfolks in city government"},"513":{"dur":1,"text":"to make sure that\nthey were accurate"},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"and they put them\ninto Honolulu Answers."},"517":{"dur":1,"text":"And at the end of\nthe day, pretty much"},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"most of the questions\nthat citizens need"},"521":{"dur":4,"text":"answered were in this interface\nas a sort of alternative"},"525":{"dur":0,"text":"to Honolulu.gov."},"526":{"dur":4,"text":"And more importantly, this\npeople had a fantastic time."},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"At the end of the day, they\nwere drinking, having fun."},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"The mayor stopped by\nand hung out with them."},"535":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think it was\nprobably the first time"},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"that I realized that government\ntechnology was actually"},"540":{"dur":1,"text":"like a party."},"541":{"dur":5,"text":"And these people not only felt\nlike they'd enjoyed themselves,"},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"but they now feel\nowners of the site."},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"And they felt like they were\nhelping their fellow citizens"},"553":{"dur":4,"text":"in a way, using skills that\nthey had, not just tech skills."},"557":{"dur":4,"text":"So that basic interface is\nnow in about a dozen cities"},"562":{"dur":1,"text":"around the country."},"563":{"dur":4,"text":"On National Day of Civic\nHacking two Junes ago,"},"567":{"dur":3,"text":"Tim and I went to\na co-working space"},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"a block from Oakland\nCity Hall, and worked"},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"on a very similar

from\nour site from ages ago."},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"It's in many more places now."},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"But those three things I think\nare really illustrated here."},"606":{"dur":1,"text":"This notion that\nthe interfaces can"},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"be much more beautiful\nand easy to use."},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"The notion that people\ndon't just need to complain,"},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"they can help."},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"And the fact that these\nsolutions can spread."},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"And when you think\nof those things,"},"617":{"dur":3,"text":"I think you start to believe\nin our mission statement, which"},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"is that government can work."},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"You can stop there, and\nwe're pretty controversial."},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"We believe that\ngovernment can work"},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"for the people-- for\nactual real people--"},"630":{"dur":3,"text":"by the people, helping\nout in the 21st century,"},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"using these solutions."},"635":{"dur":2,"text":"But it's not going to\nhappen, because we complain."},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not going to\nhappen, because we"},"640":{"dur":3,"text":"are frustrated and\nyell, and advocate"},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"for government to\ndo differently."},"644":{"dur":5,"text":"It's going to happen because\nwe the people, make it happen."},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"So I have spent the\npast couple of years"},"651":{"dur":1,"text":"just trying to get\npeople to believe this,"},"653":{"dur":3,"text":"trying to tell stories that\nillustrate what's possible."},"657":{"dur":3,"text":"And then last April I was asked\nto come serve in the White"},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"House as the Deputy\nChief Technology Officer."},"664":{"dur":2,"text":"And I got there and start\nworking on this idea"},"666":{"dur":3,"text":"that we could replicate

all of the\nplanning up front."},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"And when we do that--\nClay Shirky had"},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"a great line about\nthis-- actually he and I"},"778":{"dur":1,"text":"talked a lot during the year."},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"And he wrote up an article\nin \"Foreign Affairs\" where"},"781":{"dur":3,"text":"he explained that the waterfall\nmethod amounts by a

it."},"2827":{"dur":2,"text":"Then it makes people feel a\nlittle bit more comfortable."},"2829":{"dur":4,"text":"So we have to have the people\nthere to back up the

well."},"2884":{"dur":2,"text":"It's extremely intense."},"2886":{"dur":2,"text":"What we can do though is\nscale the outputs of it."},"2888":{"dur":1,"text":"And so we've built a\nseries of other

to\nempower them, to help"},"2898":{"dur":3,"text":"them pilot these things\nin their own cities."},"2902":{"dur":3,"text":"And in that essentially is\nthe play that we're running."},"2905":{"dur":2,"text":"It gets a little bit more\nsophisticated every year."},"2908":{"dur":2,"text":"And it gets more sophisticated,\nbecause we get more

think,"},"2986":{"dur":2,"text":"at the way our criminal\njustice system is working."},"2988":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's absolutely\ntrue that a lot of that"},"2990":{"dur":1,"text":"is due to terrible policy."},"2992":{"dur":3,"text":"But an enormous amount of\nit is due to incompetence"},"2996":{"dur":1,"text":"of the system."},"2997":{"dur":1,"text":"We can't get people\nout of

that we"},"3018":{"dur":4,"text":"could do using data to get\npeople not held pre-trial."},"3023":{"dur":2,"text":"And there are all sorts of\nfollow-on effects to that."},"3025":{"dur":1,"text":"If

is in\nthe jails, and manage"},"3090":{"dur":2,"text":"that population in any way."},"3093":{"dur":1,"text":"We've done these\ncourt date reminders."},"3094":{"dur":4,"text":"So that people who need
