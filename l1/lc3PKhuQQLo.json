percentages of the vote."},"478":{"dur":3,"text":"But the interesting thing\nabout the oral story in India"},"481":{"dur":5,"text":"is that characteristically,\nit's not told as a linear

up,"},"519":{"dur":4,"text":"he will usually start\nwith an anecdote drawn out"},"524":{"dur":4,"text":"of mythology, out of the rich\nIndian mythological tradition."},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"And he'll tell that\nfor a bit, and then he"},"531":{"dur":3,"text":"will connect that to\nperhaps some political event"},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"of the time and try and show you\nthe connections between that,"},"537":{"dur":3,"text":"and then he'll connect that\nto some possible anecdote"},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"of his own life, and then\nhe'll sing a little song,"},"543":{"dur":1,"text":"and then

delightful."},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"The audience enjoys\nthe skill with which"},"567":{"dur":3,"text":"the story lines are interwoven."},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"And just when you think it\ncan't get any more complicated,"},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"he'll throw another\nball in the air"},"575":{"dur":5,"text":"and juggle these narrative\nballs, if you like."},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"And I thought, this\nis the exact opposite"},"582":{"dur":3,"text":"of what you're taught\nabout how to write a story."},"585":{"dur":3,"text":"And yet, here is this\nvery, very ancient

it\nbecomes very clear"},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"when they're not with you."},"605":{"dur":3,"text":"And so everything\nabout oral narration"},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"is designed to hold the\naudience's attention."},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"That's its sole purpose."},"613":{"dur":3,"text":"And interestingly\nthen, this playfulness,"},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"this multiple\nnarration, turns

of\nnarrative lines that"},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"weave in and out of each\nother, and I sometimes"},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"think of it and others\nof my books as being,"},"644":{"dur":3,"text":"in a

so-called,"},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"many of those stories\nactually originated in India."},"738":{"dur":4,"text":"The journey of that book\nis very interesting."},"742":{"dur":1,"text":"Almost certainly,\nmost of the stories"},"744":{"dur":1,"text":"started out as Indian folktales."},"745":{"dur":3,"text":"And then at a certain point\nthey were written down"},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"in
