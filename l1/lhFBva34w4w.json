{"0":{"dur":0,"text":"All right, good morning."},"2":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you so much for\njoining the session."},"4":{"dur":1,"text":"My name is Arun Ulag."},"6":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm with the cloud\nenterprise engineering team."},"9":{"dur":1,"text":"My team and I are responsible for"},"11":{"dur":3,"text":"our product portfolios such as Power\nBI, Power Apps, Microsoft Flow."},"15":{"dur":3,"text":"As well as some of the pro\nservices underneath them."},"18":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm driving my colleague Sanjay\nSoni, he's part of our marketing"},"21":{"dur":2,"text":"team, so he and I will be\ndoing the session together."},"23":{"dur":2,"text":"We're also gonna be joined\nby one of our good partners,"},"26":{"dur":3,"text":"Hitachi Solutions, and Dr.\nSebastian Morris."},"29":{"dur":3,"text":"So the topic of this session\nwas pretty much about how you"},"32":{"dur":1,"text":"can drive solutions with Power BI."},"34":{"dur":3,"text":"What we'll talk about, so we'll\nspend the majority of this session"},"38":{"dur":2,"text":"on industry solutions with Power BI."},"40":{"dur":3,"text":"But before we get into that, I just\nwanted share a little bit about"},"43":{"dur":3,"text":"our strategy in terms of what\nare we driving towards, and"},"47":{"dur":1,"text":"how it all fits together."},"48":{"dur":2,"text":"Then share a little bit about\nhow we differentiate, and"},"51":{"dur":2,"text":"what other capabilities\nthat we're investing in,"},"54":{"dur":1,"text":"to make life easier for you guys."},"56":{"dur":3,"text":"And then we'll spend the majority\nof our time on demonstrations for"},"59":{"dur":2,"text":"Power BI industry solutions."},"61":{"dur":2,"text":"With that, let me get started."},"64":{"dur":3,"text":"So, from a strategy perspective,\nwhen we talked to customers,"},"67":{"dur":3,"text":"they're really trying to make\nsure that they go from data"},"71":{"dur":2,"text":"to understanding what happened,"},"74":{"dur":3,"text":"to understanding why things happened\nand then move forward to understand"},"78":{"dur":3,"text":"what's likely to happen to be\nable predict the future outcome."},"81":{"dur":4,"text":"And then be able to understand\nwhat they need to do"},"85":{"dur":1,"text":"in order to influence what happens."},"86":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's kind of prescribe what\nthe actions they need to take"},"89":{"dur":3,"text":"in order to influence the outcomes\nthat they want, right."},"92":{"dur":1,"text":"So this should not be\na surprise to you."},"94":{"dur":2,"text":"Most of you guys are probably\non this journey."},"96":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's kind of\nwhere we are going."},"98":{"dur":2,"text":"The way we're doing\nthis is by investing"},"101":{"dur":2,"text":"in the Cortana Intelligence stack."},"103":{"dur":5,"text":"The Cortana Intelligence stack is\nour cloud-based end to end platform"},"108":{"dur":2,"text":"and it has four different pillars."},"111":{"dur":3,"text":"We're not going to go into any of\nthese specific pillars today, but"},"114":{"dur":2,"text":"you're going to be able to\nsee these pillars in action."},"117":{"dur":2,"text":"The first pillar is about\nhow you ingest data."},"119":{"dur":3,"text":"Data coming in real time, data\ncoming in from on-premise sources."},"123":{"dur":1,"text":"How do you orchestrate\nthe data movement?"},"125":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's the information\nmanagement layer,"},"126":{"dur":3,"text":"the layer furthest to your left."},"130":{"dur":2,"text":"The next layer is about\nour big data storage."},"132":{"dur":2,"text":"It could be structured storage\nwith a parallel data warehouse or"},"134":{"dur":1,"text":"it could be unstructured storage."},"136":{"dur":2,"text":"So we support both of\nthose capabilities."},"138":{"dur":1,"text":"The layer after that is\na machine learning and"},"140":{"dur":3,"text":"analytics layer, where we invest\nin Azure machine learning,"},"143":{"dur":3,"text":"where we invest in analytics based\non our unstructured storage."},"147":{"dur":3,"text":"As well as we support\nboth Cloudera and"},"150":{"dur":3,"text":"Hotworx from a Hadoop perspective."},"154":{"dur":3,"text":"We also have stream analytics, so as\ndata comes in in real time you can"},"157":{"dur":3,"text":"analyze it pretty much\nas it comes in, and"},"161":{"dur":2,"text":"then be able to extract\nintelligence in real time."},"163":{"dur":3,"text":"And the last layer is very actually\nhelp put all of this together for"},"167":{"dur":1,"text":"our business users."},"168":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's where Power BI comes in\nand let allows you to make sure that"},"172":{"dur":2,"text":"you know, our business users get\nthe insights that they need."},"174":{"dur":3,"text":"So in this session it's primarily\ngonna be focused on industries"},"178":{"dur":3,"text":"solutions for Power BI however,\nhowever, you'll see many of these"},"181":{"dur":3,"text":"components in action as we as we\nlooked different customer examples."},"187":{"dur":3,"text":"The other concept I wanted to\nintroduce is that BI is powerful and"},"191":{"dur":1,"text":"interesting."},"192":{"dur":3,"text":"However, it's even more important\nto be able to translate"},"195":{"dur":1,"text":"those insights into action."},"197":{"dur":2,"text":"So we've been investing in\na couple of new products."},"200":{"dur":3,"text":"One is called PowerApps, the other\none is called Microsoft Flow."},"204":{"dur":2,"text":"Both of these products\nare currently in public preview, so"},"206":{"dur":1,"text":"you can test them today."},"208":{"dur":3,"text":"But the idea being is that, hey,\nif you have some insights and"},"211":{"dur":2,"text":"you want to convert that\ninto action, very often,"},"214":{"dur":2,"text":"you need to be able to invest\nin building an application."},"217":{"dur":3,"text":"And this application often needs to\nbe available on your iPhones and"},"221":{"dur":3,"text":"your iPads and your Android devices\nin addition to being available on"},"224":{"dur":1,"text":"Windows on the web."},"225":{"dur":2,"text":"However, building mobile\napplications is very complex."},"228":{"dur":1,"text":"It takes a lot of time."},"229":{"dur":2,"text":"You've to build it for\nseveral mobile platforms and"},"231":{"dur":3,"text":"it takes a long time to deploy\nas you get through app stores."},"234":{"dur":3,"text":"So Power Apps is a rapid\napplication development platform."},"238":{"dur":1,"text":"It helps you build\napplications quickly."},"240":{"dur":2,"text":"It helps you get applications\nquickly in hands of the enterprise"},"242":{"dur":3,"text":"customers and to build these\napplications, you don't need to do"},"245":{"dur":4,"text":"anything more than be able to use\nExcel like formula languages, right?"},"250":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'm gonna show you one example\nwhere we have an airline maintenance"},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"scenario where we combine\ninsights with action"},"255":{"dur":1,"text":"driven though Power apps."},"257":{"dur":4,"text":"Microsoft Flow is an automation\nframework, so in many cases you can"},"261":{"dur":3,"text":"set up rules, where based\non different triggers and"},"265":{"dur":3,"text":"different conditions, you can\ntrigger automated work flows, again"},"268":{"dur":2,"text":"Microsoft Flows is something that\nyou don't need to be a programmer to"},"271":{"dur":3,"text":"use, you can actually set it up and\nuse it with pretty much"},"274":{"dur":2,"text":"a dragon drop interface and\nExcel like formula."},"277":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's pretty much\nwhere we're going."},"279":{"dur":3,"text":"Being able to get deep insights,\nbeing able to understand why things"},"282":{"dur":3,"text":"happen, being able to predict what's\nlikely to happen influence what you"},"285":{"dur":4,"text":"want to happen, as well being able\nto translate to insight into action."},"290":{"dur":2,"text":"So, that's our strategy."},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"In terms of the areas we choose\nto differentiate, before I get"},"295":{"dur":4,"text":"into the actual solution examples,\nthere's about five, or six areas,"},"299":{"dur":3,"text":"that we're deeply investing\nin from a BI perspective."},"303":{"dur":3,"text":"The first one is real time\nanalytics with live dashboards so"},"306":{"dur":2,"text":"this is something that has become\nincreasingly more important to our"},"309":{"dur":3,"text":"Our customers are looking to\nunderstand not just what happened"},"312":{"dur":4,"text":"last month, last quarter, last\nmonth, last week, yesterday, they're"},"316":{"dur":3,"text":"trying to help understand things as\nthey happen in real time, right?"},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"Because Power BI is\na cloud service and"},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"it's a cloud service\nbuilt on the Azure stack,"},"325":{"dur":3,"text":"we have native support for real-time\ncapabilities, and I'll show you"},"328":{"dur":2,"text":"a couple of examples where we\nactually do that today, all right?"},"331":{"dur":1,"text":"But that's something that's native,\nthat's easy, and"},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"it's a really important\ncapability for our customers."},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"So the first area of\ndifferentiation for"},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"us is being able to\nsupport live dashboards."},"340":{"dur":3,"text":"The second area of differentiation\nfor us is custom visualizations."},"344":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is interesting because as\na visualization platform we need to"},"347":{"dur":3,"text":"have a wide variety of really first\nclass visualizations, and Power BI"},"351":{"dur":4,"text":"ships out of the box with dozens and\ndozens of fantastic visualizations."},"356":{"dur":3,"text":"However, our goal is to get BI\nin the hands of a billion users."},"360":{"dur":3,"text":"And first to get BI in the hands\nof a billion users, we recognize"},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"that there are so many scenarios\nthat are unique by industry,"},"366":{"dur":3,"text":"that are unique to a particular\ncustomer, to a particular partner."},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"So what we've done is,\nwe have chosen to build all our"},"372":{"dur":4,"text":"visualizations, our native\nvisualizations, on B3 and node JS."},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"We've also chosen to open source\nall our visualization, so"},"380":{"dur":1,"text":"they all publish in GitHub right."},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"Now the reason the reason we did\nthat is we recognize that you might"},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"be to build your own visualizations,\nright, so you can take our"},"387":{"dur":3,"text":"visualization code, you can tailor\nit to be all unique requirements."},"391":{"dur":3,"text":"You can also choose to build custom\nvisualization based on our API's and"},"394":{"dur":2,"text":"they will work beautifully\nwith our platform."},"397":{"dur":4,"text":"This has also spawned a community\nof folks who build these custom"},"401":{"dur":3,"text":"visualizations and choose to\nshare it back with the community."},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you go to visuals.powerbi.com\ntoday, you will see dozens and"},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"dozens of visualizations\nthat others have built and"},"411":{"dur":1,"text":"have shared back to the community."},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is a capability that\ncustomers really appreciate."},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"Because, instead of tightly\ncontrolling all of the visualization"},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"code, we have chosen to open\nsource sets, so that you can,"},"421":{"dur":4,"text":"not only use ours, but customize\nours, choose to build your own, and"},"425":{"dur":3,"text":"benefit from the community of open\nsource visualizations out there."},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"The third area is,\nnatural language query."},"432":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is an area that Power BI has\nbeen investing in for several years,"},"436":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's an area that is very\npopular with our business users,"},"439":{"dur":3,"text":"because business users want to help\nthemselves as much as they can."},"442":{"dur":3,"text":"And if they can ask questions in\nEnglish and Power BI can translate"},"446":{"dur":4,"text":"those questions to understand what\nthe business user's intent is."},"451":{"dur":1,"text":"Go into the data set and"},"452":{"dur":3,"text":"put together a visualization\nthat answers the question."},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"It makes life easy for\nthe business user."},"457":{"dur":3,"text":"But it also makes life easier for\nthe business analyst"},"460":{"dur":3,"text":"who supports the business user, so\nthat they're not always the single"},"464":{"dur":3,"text":"point of contact for\nany question the business user has."},"467":{"dur":1,"text":"So this has been native\nto our platform,"},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"it's been native to our\nplatform from the beginning."},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's an area where\nwe continue to invest."},"474":{"dur":3,"text":"The next area of differentiation is\na deep integration with productivity"},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"tools, specifically Excel."},"479":{"dur":4,"text":"So we've made some choices that make\nit very easy for Excel data to flow"},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"into Power BI and for\nPower BI data to flow into Excel. Right?"},"488":{"dur":0,"text":"of points."},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"The data modeling lair\nin Power BI is built"},"492":{"dur":3,"text":"on something called data\nanalysis expressions or DAX."},"495":{"dur":4,"text":"Now for those of you who views\nExcel PowerPivot tables, or your"},"499":{"dur":3,"text":"SQL Server analysis services you're\nprobably already familiar with DAX."},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"By using Dax in Power Bi,\nA, we make it very"},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"easy to have a large group of people\nwho are already familiar with DAX."},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"But B, we also make it easy for"},"512":{"dur":4,"text":"you to bring your Excel code, your\nExcel populate tables into Power BI."},"516":{"dur":4,"text":"So you can bring your Excel sheet\nas-is, Power BI desktop will need to"},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"be understand the data models, we'll\nbe able to import the data model."},"524":{"dur":1,"text":"We'll be able to import\nthe connection strings."},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"It'll be able to import\nthe visualization, so"},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"you can start something\nwith what you already have."},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"What it also allows you to do is you\ncan take portions of your Excel file"},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"and paste them alone to Power BI,\nright?"},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"Or you can choose to render\nyour entire Excel sheet"},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"natively in Power BI,\nwe fully support that."},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"A few months ago, we also delivered\na capability that has been very"},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"popular with business analysts."},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"Now that you have your data models\nup and running in Power BI and"},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"you have your visualizations,\nsometimes business analysts just"},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"want to be able to connect to\nthe data model out there, and"},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"be able to suck the data out and\npivot it in Excel so"},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"that they can do some\nad hoc analysis."},"562":{"dur":1,"text":"We now support that as well so"},"564":{"dur":3,"text":"you can connect from Excel\ninto your Power BI data model."},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"And then they're able to suck\nthe data out just like you would but"},"570":{"dur":1,"text":"SQL server analysis services, right."},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"So this have been really popular\nwith the business analysts."},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"This is not typically something\na business user do, but"},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"it's something that business\nanalysts really appreciate."},"579":{"dur":4,"text":"Because what you publish into Power\nBI is no longer just a back box,"},"584":{"dur":4,"text":"it's something that allows you\nto get your data out as well."},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"And the last area here\nis the deep integration."},"590":{"dur":3,"text":"Actually we talked about data\nmodeling based on data as"},"593":{"dur":0,"text":"an expression."},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"And the last area is the deep\nintegration with SQL Server"},"597":{"dur":1,"text":"reporting services."},"598":{"dur":4,"text":"With SQL Server 2016, we have\nrefreshed the user interface layer"},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"for SQL Server reporting services,\nit's now based on HTML 5."},"606":{"dur":3,"text":"We also allow you to take\nyour SSRS reports and"},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"then pin them to Power BI, right?"},"611":{"dur":3,"text":"So that PowerBI now becomes a single\nset of dashboards which could be"},"615":{"dur":4,"text":"native PowerBI dashboards, it could\nbe Excel files, it could be SSRS"},"619":{"dur":4,"text":"reports, and you can drill down from\nthere into your detail SSRS reports."},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"We fully support that capability and"},"626":{"dur":4,"text":"in a few months we'll also allow you\nto publish PowerBI desktop files"},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"into SQL Server and\nreporting services on-premise."},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you wanted to have\na purely on-premise solution"},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"that will be supported,\nas well, right?"},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is kind of the direction\nwe are going with Power BI, and"},"640":{"dur":3,"text":"its associated services the Cortana\nIntelligence Stack, Excel and"},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"SQL Server reporting services."},"645":{"dur":1,"text":"So with that,"},"646":{"dur":4,"text":"let me switch into showing you\nsome of our customer examples."},"651":{"dur":3,"text":"But before I do that, I just wanted\nto kind of share with you a little"},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"bit about how the analysts\nare excited about our vision."},"657":{"dur":4,"text":"Forrester came out last year\nwith their Agile BI wave, and"},"662":{"dur":3,"text":"this came out in September,\nabout a couple of months after"},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"Power BI Version 2 went\nto general availability."},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"They put Power BI furthest\nto the top right and"},"671":{"dur":4,"text":"we are very excited to see\nthe progress we made with Forrester."},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"Gartner came out in February\nthis year with their revised"},"678":{"dur":1,"text":"Magic Quadrant."},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"They had three companies in\nthe leaders' quadrant, Power BI,"},"682":{"dur":3,"text":"Tableau, and Qlik, and they put\nPower BI furthest to the right in"},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"terms of product capabilities and\nvision."},"688":{"dur":3,"text":"So again, this vision of modern BI,\nthis set of differentiators has"},"692":{"dur":3,"text":"really resonated with not only\ncustomers, but also with analysts."},"695":{"dur":3,"text":"And this resulted in a lot of\ncustomer adoption for Power BI very,"},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"very quickly."},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"So with that,\nlet me stretch to the solutions."},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"Now I'm gonna talk about three\nthings from a solutions perspective."},"706":{"dur":5,"text":"I'm gonna talk about how you can\nleverage some pre-built solutions"},"711":{"dur":3,"text":"that we ship, that's a relatively\nnew capability with Power BI."},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm gonna talk about partner\nsolutions, I'm also gonna talk"},"717":{"dur":1,"text":"to you about some examples\nof what customers are doing."},"718":{"dur":3,"text":"All right, so as we get started\none of the things that we"},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"always remind ourselves is\nwhat you tell us, right."},"725":{"dur":3,"text":"You only care about solutions that\nhelp you run your business better."},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, as excited as\nI'm about Power BI,"},"730":{"dur":3,"text":"as excited as I am about Cortana\nIntelligence, I recognize when my"},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"customers really just want to\nget their job done, right."},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"And what we're trying to do is we're\ntrying to accelerate your time to"},"738":{"dur":2,"text":"solution, right,\nthat's what we're focused on."},"741":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's, let me share a little\nbit about our approach."},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"When we work with customers, we\nrecognize that there are a number of"},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"common scenarios, right,\none example is sales analytics."},"751":{"dur":3,"text":"Now most customers have salespeople,\nsalespeople use a CRM system,"},"755":{"dur":2,"text":"they have quotas,\nquotas go up every month."},"757":{"dur":3,"text":"They have a pipeline, pipeline has\na certain maturity stage etc.,"},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"etc., that's a very common pattern,"},"764":{"dur":3,"text":"there's a bunch of common\npatterns that we've observed."},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"Once you get outside of the common\npatterns there's a lot of"},"769":{"dur":0,"text":"diversity right?"},"770":{"dur":3,"text":"The needs for oil and gas, the needs\nfor the discreet manufacturing,"},"774":{"dur":3,"text":"the needs for insurance companies,\nall of these vary."},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"There's also a ton of diversity\nbased upon the countries you're"},"780":{"dur":1,"text":"So every country has\ndifferent regulations,"},"782":{"dur":1,"text":"different business processes, etc."},"784":{"dur":2,"text":"So the approach we're taking is for\nour common scenarios,"},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"we're building and shipping\nsomething called solution templates."},"789":{"dur":1,"text":"So this has been relatively new,"},"791":{"dur":3,"text":"we shipped our first set of solution\ntemplates three months ago."},"794":{"dur":4,"text":"It's been very, very succesful with\ncustomers because it helps you get"},"798":{"dur":4,"text":"to a 50% to 70% complete solution\nwithin a couple of hours, right?"},"802":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'll demo the solution\ntemplates that we have."},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"But once we get outside of these\ncommon patterns we want to make it"},"809":{"dur":3,"text":"very easy for partners to build\nsolutions, and make it very easy for"},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"you to discover these\nsolutions form partners."},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"As well as be able to quickly\ntake them for a test drive and"},"817":{"dur":1,"text":"we'll see how that works as well."},"820":{"dur":1,"text":"So with that let me get\ninto solution templates."},"821":{"dur":1,"text":"So what are solution templates?"},"823":{"dur":4,"text":"So they are 50%-70% complete\nsolution for common BI scenarios,"},"828":{"dur":0,"text":"right."},"829":{"dur":3,"text":"What we do is we recognize that it's\nvery powerful to have an automated"},"832":{"dur":0,"text":"setup process."},"833":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'll show you how the automated\nsetup process works."},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"You can typically go through the\nautomated setup process in about 20"},"839":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not meant for business users,\nit's really meant for"},"842":{"dur":1,"text":"a business unit IT,\nor central IT, or"},"844":{"dur":3,"text":"a partner ecosystem to leverage to\nimplement for our customers, right."},"847":{"dur":2,"text":"So if we invest in\nan automated setup,"},"850":{"dur":2,"text":"it's also fully customizable, right."},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"And in order to make\nit fully customizable,"},"854":{"dur":3,"text":"we've actually open sourced\nthe code for the solution template."},"858":{"dur":2,"text":"So the solution template code\nis all posted in GitHub."},"861":{"dur":4,"text":"And the code we have implemented\nseveral Enterprise best practices so"},"866":{"dur":3,"text":"that when you set it up end to\nend all of this stuff works."},"869":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's based upon some of\nthe best practices that we've"},"871":{"dur":0,"text":"already implemented."},"873":{"dur":1,"text":"We don't charge for\nthe solution templates themselves,"},"875":{"dur":1,"text":"the solution templates\nthemselves are free."},"877":{"dur":3,"text":"All we're trying to do is for the\ncommon BI patterns we're trying to"},"880":{"dur":3,"text":"help you get to a solution quickly,\nso that business gets value within"},"884":{"dur":4,"text":"hours or days as opposed to weeks or\nmonths, right."},"889":{"dur":3,"text":"And the way the architecture of a\nsolution template typically works is"},"892":{"dur":1,"text":"it tries to set things up into it."},"894":{"dur":1,"text":"So what you see on\nthe left hand side"},"896":{"dur":2,"text":"is the source of the data right?"},"898":{"dur":2,"text":"So if it's a sales\nanalytics solution template"},"900":{"dur":4,"text":"we implement the ETL with\nSalesforce or with Dynamic CRM."},"906":{"dur":2,"text":"If it's a marketing analytic\nsolution template for brand and"},"908":{"dur":2,"text":"campaign management and\nit uses Twitter,"},"910":{"dur":3,"text":"we actually implement the ETL\ndirectly from Twitter so"},"913":{"dur":1,"text":"that that's automatically done for\nyou."},"915":{"dur":3,"text":"We're working on SAP accounts\npayable account receivable solution"},"919":{"dur":3,"text":"template, we expect to ship that\nin the next in a month or so."},"922":{"dur":3,"text":"So again, we'll automate\nthe ETL process into it."},"926":{"dur":2,"text":"Now we bring the data\ninto SQL Server, right."},"928":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's typically most customers\nchoose to put it on SQL Azure,"},"931":{"dur":1,"text":"right, so\nthe data is running in the Cloud."},"933":{"dur":2,"text":"In some cases customer\nchoose to put the data"},"936":{"dur":2,"text":"on SQL Server running\nin a virtual machine,"},"939":{"dur":2,"text":"sometimes it's running on Azure\nsometimes it's running on-premise,"},"941":{"dur":3,"text":"the automated setup will take\ncare of all of that, right?"},"945":{"dur":3,"text":"Because we open sourced the code,\nin many cases the solution"},"948":{"dur":3,"text":"templates are extended, to get other\ndata sources in and merged in."},"952":{"dur":1,"text":"So, typically what a customers does,"},"953":{"dur":2,"text":"they will start it up really\nquickly, and then they will start"},"956":{"dur":3,"text":"extending it to bring their own\nEnterprise data sources in."},"959":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, we've built a set\nof Power BI reports and"},"961":{"dur":2,"text":"dashboards, that are available\nout of the box, and"},"963":{"dur":2,"text":"they'll automatically\nconnect to your data."},"966":{"dur":2,"text":"So, that's kinda how we are trying\nto put this together end to end."},"969":{"dur":0,"text":"So let me show you how this works."},"977":{"dur":4,"text":"So now I'm on the Power BI website\nand you'll notice that right here in"},"982":{"dur":4,"text":"the website, this is PowerBI.com and\nyou have a Solutions tab."},"986":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you go into the Solutions tab\nand you click on Solution Templates,"},"989":{"dur":2,"text":"that's where you'll find\nthe solution templates that we"},"991":{"dur":0,"text":"have shipped."},"992":{"dur":1,"text":"So, again, it's relatively new,"},"993":{"dur":2,"text":"we've shipped four solution\ntemplates in the last three months."},"996":{"dur":2,"text":"And by the end of this fiscal year,\nwhich for"},"998":{"dur":1,"text":"us is another eight months or\nso away,"},"999":{"dur":3,"text":"we expect to get to over 15 for\nthe most common BI scenarios, right?"},"1003":{"dur":4,"text":"So if I scroll down, you will see\nthe four that we've already shipped."},"1008":{"dur":1,"text":"There's the Campaign\/Brand\nManagement one for"},"1010":{"dur":1,"text":"Twitter, the Sales Management for"},"1012":{"dur":2,"text":"Dynamics CRM, the Sales Management\nfor Salesforce and"},"1014":{"dur":3,"text":"then the System Center\nConfiguration Manager Analytics."},"1018":{"dur":2,"text":"So let me go into the first one,\nwhich is Sales Management for"},"1020":{"dur":0,"text":"Dynamic CRM."},"1021":{"dur":2,"text":"I click Learn More and\nI go into this page,"},"1024":{"dur":3,"text":"which shows you the Sales Management\nSolution Template for Dynamic CRM."},"1027":{"dur":3,"text":"So the first thing the business\nuser wants to see is that hey,"},"1030":{"dur":2,"text":"if I choose Power BI,\nif I choose Azure, if I choose"},"1033":{"dur":4,"text":"the solution template, what will\nmy reports look like, right?"},"1038":{"dur":3,"text":"What can I see, and how will it\nhelp me run my business better?"},"1041":{"dur":2,"text":"So they've posted a demo for\nyou right here"},"1044":{"dur":2,"text":"that actually uses Power BI to\nactually show off the output in"},"1047":{"dur":3,"text":"the solution template literally the\nminute it finishes running, right?"},"1050":{"dur":2,"text":"So when I hit View Report,\nyou will see a report"},"1053":{"dur":3,"text":"come up that is built on Power BI\nthat shows you the output of"},"1057":{"dur":2,"text":"the solution template literally\nthe minute it finishes running."},"1060":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm gonna go to full screen mode so\nI can show you this better."},"1062":{"dur":3,"text":"If I click on this thing on\nthe right it brings up the solution,"},"1065":{"dur":2,"text":"the reports, you know,\nin full screen mode."},"1068":{"dur":2,"text":"So you'll see if you're\non this first tab,"},"1070":{"dur":2,"text":"you'll see there's five tabs,\nif you look at the central bottom,"},"1073":{"dur":2,"text":"there's tabs one of five, and\nwe'll go through them very quickly."},"1076":{"dur":2,"text":"What you'll see in the first\ntab is it shows you the revenue"},"1078":{"dur":2,"text":"in terms of looking back how\nmuch revenue was landed,"},"1081":{"dur":2,"text":"what were the opportunities won,\nwhat were the opportunities lost."},"1084":{"dur":3,"text":"Looking ahead, how much revenue\nis currently in the pipeline?"},"1087":{"dur":2,"text":"And you know all of this is\nsliceable and dicable, so I can go"},"1090":{"dur":2,"text":"and say hey show me my revenue for\nMarch, how much is coming out?"},"1092":{"dur":2,"text":"Let me show you let me go\ninto a particular week."},"1095":{"dur":1,"text":"So again when you show\nthis to a business user,"},"1097":{"dur":2,"text":"you can help them understand how\nthey can run their business better"},"1100":{"dur":2,"text":"if they were to implement\nthe solution template."},"1102":{"dur":1,"text":"If I go to the second tab,"},"1103":{"dur":3,"text":"it helps you understand some of the\nKPIs around business performance."},"1107":{"dur":2,"text":"So this looks at revenue\nyear over year growth,"},"1110":{"dur":2,"text":"month to date, quarter to date,\nand year to date."},"1112":{"dur":1,"text":"So I can go in and say hey,"},"1114":{"dur":2,"text":"how did my revenue performance\ndo over the last three years?"},"1117":{"dur":2,"text":"I can go look at the performance\nof my different sales managers,"},"1119":{"dur":2,"text":"I can see how Justine is doing,\nor Mohammed is doing, or"},"1121":{"dur":1,"text":"how is doing, right?"},"1123":{"dur":2,"text":"Because all of this is Power BI,\nall of this is live, and"},"1125":{"dur":1,"text":"all of this is interactive."},"1127":{"dur":2,"text":"Again, this is the output of\nthe solution template literally"},"1129":{"dur":2,"text":"the minute the solution\ntemplate finishes running."},"1132":{"dur":1,"text":"The third tab is a little\nbit more complex,"},"1134":{"dur":2,"text":"because it tries to bring\nall the data together."},"1136":{"dur":2,"text":"What you see on the bottom right is,"},"1138":{"dur":2,"text":"the black line is the quotas\nthat go up every single month."},"1141":{"dur":3,"text":"The green line shows you where\nyou expect your revenue to land"},"1145":{"dur":2,"text":"if the opportunities in your\npipeline come in, right?"},"1148":{"dur":3,"text":"You can see the shape of your\npipeline at different sales stages."},"1151":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can choose to filter\nthem based on the sales stage."},"1153":{"dur":2,"text":"What you see here is\nthe pipeline coverage for"},"1156":{"dur":1,"text":"your different sales managers."},"1157":{"dur":1,"text":"And here you see\nthe pipeline coverage for"},"1159":{"dur":1,"text":"your different product lines."},"1160":{"dur":3,"text":"Right below you see the actual\nopportunities in Dynamic CRM or"},"1164":{"dur":1,"text":"Salesforce, right?"},"1165":{"dur":1,"text":"So I can go and slice and\ndice, I can say hey,"},"1167":{"dur":1,"text":"what is your scenes\npipeline coverage?"},"1168":{"dur":3,"text":"Your scene has 83% pipeline\ncoverage, a $16 million gap and"},"1171":{"dur":1,"text":"you can see the shape\nof this pipeline."},"1173":{"dur":3,"text":"I can also go into my printers\nproduct line and show me,"},"1176":{"dur":2,"text":"hey, how is my printers\nbusiness doing?"},"1179":{"dur":1,"text":"And again I can go say, hey,"},"1180":{"dur":3,"text":"in this particular case I\nhave 129% pipeline coverage."},"1184":{"dur":4,"text":"I have a surplus of about\n$11.7 million in revenue."},"1188":{"dur":1,"text":"I can go in and say,\nhey you know what,"},"1190":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't believe that all my\nopportunity stages will land."},"1192":{"dur":2,"text":"What if only opportunities\nabout 60% landed,"},"1195":{"dur":2,"text":"will I still make my revenue number,\nright?"},"1197":{"dur":3,"text":"So it helps you really get very good\nsales analytics Out of the box with"},"1201":{"dur":3,"text":"Power BI, but all the data flowing\nthrough from Dynamic CRM into Azure"},"1205":{"dur":1,"text":"into your Power BI."},"1206":{"dur":1,"text":"The posts that look like this."},"1208":{"dur":2,"text":"drill down onto your specific\nPower BI opportunities."},"1211":{"dur":3,"text":"So you can go in and look at your\nopportunities and you can click from"},"1214":{"dur":3,"text":"here into the specific opportunities\nin Dynamic CRM or Salesforce,"},"1217":{"dur":1,"text":"it'll open them up."},"1218":{"dur":3,"text":"So the reports look the same,\nregardless of whether you use"},"1221":{"dur":2,"text":"the Dynamics CRM or\nthe sales for solution template."},"1224":{"dur":2,"text":"The next couple of tabs, I won't\ngo through them in detail, but"},"1227":{"dur":2,"text":"that helps you understand your\npipeline gap by sales manager."},"1230":{"dur":1,"text":"Again, all of this is sliceable."},"1231":{"dur":2,"text":"All of this you can drop-down\ninto individual salespeople and"},"1234":{"dur":3,"text":"the next tab shows you the pipeline\ngap by different product lines."},"1238":{"dur":1,"text":"So what we're trying\nto do is to say, hey,"},"1239":{"dur":2,"text":"when you set up the solution\ntemplate, all of this works and"},"1242":{"dur":1,"text":"to again, you get these\nreports out of the box."},"1243":{"dur":1,"text":"The data is open source."},"1245":{"dur":3,"text":"The models are documented, so you or\na partner can choose to extend them"},"1249":{"dur":2,"text":"and customize them to\nyour customers's needs."},"1251":{"dur":3,"text":"So first, as you see what\nthe reports look like."},"1255":{"dur":2,"text":"The second is we have tried\nto really simplify the setup"},"1258":{"dur":2,"text":"So for example, you'll see\nan Install Now button here."},"1261":{"dur":1,"text":"So if I hit Install Now,"},"1262":{"dur":3,"text":"you will see an application come\nup that's built by our team."},"1266":{"dur":1,"text":"So, this is an installation wizard."},"1267":{"dur":3,"text":"So this basically says, hey,\ndo you want to use Dynamic CRM or"},"1271":{"dur":2,"text":"do you wanna use\nDynamic CRM on premise?"},"1273":{"dur":2,"text":"Do you wanna just use Power BI or"},"1275":{"dur":4,"text":"do you wanna use SQL Server\nAnalysis Services in the middle?"},"1279":{"dur":1,"text":"If you have small datasets,\nyou can just use Power BI."},"1281":{"dur":1,"text":"If you have a very large dataset,"},"1282":{"dur":2,"text":"you might choose to run SQL Server\nAnalysis Services in the middle."},"1285":{"dur":3,"text":"And you can say, hey, do I want to\nuse SQL Server as my data warehouse"},"1289":{"dur":1,"text":"or do I wanna use Azure SQL?"},"1290":{"dur":2,"text":"And you literally pick\nthese options, hit Next."},"1293":{"dur":2,"text":"And then in this particular case,"},"1295":{"dur":3,"text":"we work with an ETL provider called\nScribe who's an ISV that we work"},"1299":{"dur":2,"text":"closely with to\nactually setup the ETL."},"1301":{"dur":1,"text":"We're working on native\ncapability as well,"},"1303":{"dur":1,"text":"which should become available\nin the next six weeks or so."},"1305":{"dur":1,"text":"So if you're a Scribe customer,\nyou can use this."},"1306":{"dur":2,"text":"If you wanna setup a new Scribe\naccount, you can use this."},"1308":{"dur":2,"text":"If you want to use our native\ncapability, it'll be available soon."},"1311":{"dur":1,"text":"So again, you can just go in and\nsay, hey,"},"1313":{"dur":1,"text":"I wanna signup for a new user."},"1314":{"dur":3,"text":"You can enter what you wanna setup\nand we'll setup the account for"},"1317":{"dur":0,"text":"you in Scribe."},"1318":{"dur":3,"text":"If you're an existing Scribe,\nyou can just enter your credentials,"},"1321":{"dur":2,"text":"then you setup your source\ncredentials to Dynamics CRM."},"1323":{"dur":2,"text":"You setup your target credentials\nto the data warehouse we set"},"1326":{"dur":2,"text":"You customize a couple of things\nthat could start off your fiscal"},"1329":{"dur":1,"text":"year and\npretty much hit Run Solution."},"1331":{"dur":2,"text":"So at that point,\nyou'll see the solution get started."},"1333":{"dur":2,"text":"You'll see it connected Dynamics\nCRM, you'll start seeing it pull"},"1336":{"dur":2,"text":"the data, the accounts table,\nthe opportunities table."},"1338":{"dur":1,"text":"It will build the data\nmark on Azure."},"1340":{"dur":4,"text":"It will create a security model by\ncrawling the sales hierarchy out of"},"1344":{"dur":0,"text":"Dynamics CRM."},"1345":{"dur":2,"text":"So, we know who's who\nopposed to who and"},"1347":{"dur":2,"text":"every sales manager can\nonly see his or her data."},"1350":{"dur":3,"text":"So, we set all of these end to end\nand we let you download a Power BI"},"1354":{"dur":3,"text":"desktop report that is already\nconnected to your data model."},"1357":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you hit Refresh, the Power BI\ndoes start report refreshes and"},"1361":{"dur":3,"text":"the report is pretty much look like\nthe one that I showed you before"},"1365":{"dur":2,"text":"which was the demo\nthat I just showed."},"1367":{"dur":4,"text":"So typically, it takes about 20,\n25 minutes to go through the setup"},"1371":{"dur":3,"text":"wizard, to get your data and\nget your credentials setup."},"1375":{"dur":2,"text":"But once you set it up, it could\ntake a couple of hours to set it up,"},"1378":{"dur":1,"text":"it may take a little bit longer."},"1379":{"dur":2,"text":"Because the very first time\nit's pulling all your data down"},"1382":{"dur":2,"text":"from Dynamics CRM or\nSalesforce, or your ETL source."},"1384":{"dur":1,"text":"After that, it's only doing deltas."},"1386":{"dur":3,"text":"It's only doing incremental\nrefreshes, so it's super quick."},"1389":{"dur":2,"text":"So, that's how this template works."},"1392":{"dur":3,"text":"The reports are what you see here,\nthe reports that you see,"},"1395":{"dur":2,"text":"the installation experience\nis automated and"},"1397":{"dur":3,"text":"you also notice right here that\nwe have some partners, Sikich."},"1400":{"dur":0,"text":"For example,"},"1401":{"dur":2,"text":"Hitachi Solutions that already\ntrained on our solution template."},"1404":{"dur":3,"text":"And if you just want them to come\nin and do a quick POC for you,"},"1407":{"dur":3,"text":"all you do is click on this and you\nwill see a POC form from Hitachi."},"1410":{"dur":4,"text":"That if you fill in, Hitachi will\ncall you literally right away and"},"1414":{"dur":1,"text":"then set this stuff up."},"1416":{"dur":2,"text":"Typically, what I found works is\nthat they'll spend a couple of hours"},"1419":{"dur":2,"text":"setting it up and then they'll work\nwith you for a day or two to define"},"1422":{"dur":2,"text":"how you want this tailored before\nyou flip this to production."},"1424":{"dur":2,"text":"We have seen customers flip it to\nproduction right away, because they"},"1427":{"dur":2,"text":"can start getting analytics\nin front of the Salesforce."},"1429":{"dur":2,"text":"We've seen customers take a few\nweeks to tailor this to their unique"},"1432":{"dur":1,"text":"business requirements\nboth in data and"},"1433":{"dur":1,"text":"before they flip it to production."},"1435":{"dur":3,"text":"So, that's kinda how this solution\ntemplate works end to end."},"1438":{"dur":3,"text":"So, that was the sales management\nsolution template for Dynamics CRM."},"1442":{"dur":2,"text":"The sales management\nsolution template for"},"1444":{"dur":2,"text":"Salesforce looks pretty\nmuch exactly alike."},"1446":{"dur":4,"text":"Except in that case it's setting up\nthe ETL from Sales Force instead of"},"1451":{"dur":1,"text":"the ETL from Dynamic CRM."},"1453":{"dur":1,"text":"Just wanted to show\nyou the reports for"},"1454":{"dur":1,"text":"a couple of the other\nsolution templates."},"1456":{"dur":1,"text":"This one's been very popular,"},"1458":{"dur":2,"text":"we only released it\nabout two weeks back."},"1460":{"dur":3,"text":"This is the System Center\nConfiguration Manager analytics,"},"1464":{"dur":2,"text":"especially useful for\nour IT departments."},"1467":{"dur":1,"text":"What I'll do is I'll just\nshow you the View Report."},"1468":{"dur":1,"text":"So again, if I hit View Report,"},"1470":{"dur":3,"text":"you'll see a demo come up with some\ndatasets that we have put together."},"1473":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm gonna go to full-screen mode,\nso you can see this better, but"},"1477":{"dur":3,"text":"this gives you a quick view into all\nthe analytics that are available"},"1481":{"dur":3,"text":"through your System Center\nConfiguration Manager instance."},"1484":{"dur":1,"text":"So the first tab here shows\nyou all your clients,"},"1486":{"dur":1,"text":"you can see total clients,\ntotal users."},"1488":{"dur":1,"text":"You can see the different\noperating system types."},"1492":{"dur":3,"text":"The next tab shows you your health\nevaluation and the trends, the tab"},"1495":{"dur":3,"text":"after that shows you your endpoint\ncompliance and then the tabs"},"1498":{"dur":3,"text":"after that show you the presence\nof malware and computer updates."},"1502":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is really powerful, because\nAIDA's reporting is modern and"},"1505":{"dur":3,"text":"it's very, very easy for\npeople to slice and dice the data."},"1508":{"dur":4,"text":"But the system center config manager\ndoesn't natively store historical"},"1513":{"dur":2,"text":"data, because we suck\nthe data out of the SCCM and"},"1515":{"dur":1,"text":"we store it on Azure."},"1516":{"dur":3,"text":"We actually maintain deltas, so\nyou can see trends over time."},"1520":{"dur":3,"text":"So if I go to the next tab,\nyou will see the protection status,"},"1524":{"dur":3,"text":"what's your endpoint compliance\nlook like, your NIS status,"},"1528":{"dur":4,"text":"your antivirus enablement, real-time\nprotection, et cetera, et cetera."},"1533":{"dur":2,"text":"The tab after that helps you\nunderstand the status of malware."},"1536":{"dur":0,"text":"Is it going down?"},"1537":{"dur":3,"text":"What are the severe threats\nthat you're under, etc."},"1540":{"dur":3,"text":"And then the tab after that\nlooks at missing updates."},"1543":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can say, hey,\nare my machines getting patched?"},"1546":{"dur":1,"text":"Are they getting patched quickly?"},"1548":{"dur":2,"text":"Right from here, I can go look\nat the severity of let's say,"},"1550":{"dur":0,"text":"my important patches."},"1551":{"dur":1,"text":"Are they getting done on time?"},"1553":{"dur":3,"text":"And if I want to go drill into\nany particular patch, let's say,"},"1556":{"dur":3,"text":"this Windows Server patch, I can\nclick on this information URL and"},"1560":{"dur":2,"text":"it brings up that URL\ndirectly with the source, so"},"1562":{"dur":2,"text":"you can understand what\nthis patch was about."},"1564":{"dur":3,"text":"So, and the last tab is\nabout Software Inventory."},"1568":{"dur":2,"text":"So because SSCM knows what software\ninstall on different machines,"},"1571":{"dur":2,"text":"it can show you\nthe Software Inventory."},"1573":{"dur":2,"text":"Again, the setup process\nis automated, so"},"1575":{"dur":2,"text":"you set it up end to end."},"1578":{"dur":2,"text":"We open source it, so you can extend\nthe tables to bring in other data."},"1580":{"dur":3,"text":"We will be extending it to include\nthings like service manager or"},"1584":{"dur":1,"text":"remedy or service mal,"},"1586":{"dur":3,"text":"so you'll get your ticketing\ninformation in as well."},"1589":{"dur":2,"text":"So, that is they system\ncertification manager solution"},"1592":{"dur":2,"text":"tablet and the last one that I\nwanted to quickly show you is"},"1595":{"dur":1,"text":"a Twitter solution ticket."},"1598":{"dur":3,"text":"So, this one is for camping and\nbrand management with Twitter."},"1602":{"dur":1,"text":"This has been extremely popular."},"1603":{"dur":3,"text":"This is by far, it is only\na month old and right now,"},"1606":{"dur":2,"text":"a most popular solution template."},"1608":{"dur":3,"text":"Because so many customers use\nTwitter and they really wanna get"},"1612":{"dur":3,"text":"something into it, and this can\ndo that in about ten minutes."},"1615":{"dur":1,"text":"If I hit View Report again,"},"1617":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll just show you what\nthe report looks like."},"1619":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm gonna go to full-screen\nmode again just to show you and"},"1622":{"dur":3,"text":"you'll see here, let me just flip\nto the first couple of tabs."},"1626":{"dur":2,"text":"So, the first tab looks at\nall your Outbound Tweets."},"1629":{"dur":3,"text":"So, the Outbound Tweets that have\ntweeting from different handles."},"1632":{"dur":2,"text":"What are the followers impacted?"},"1634":{"dur":1,"text":"What are the different\ntopics that are trending?"},"1636":{"dur":3,"text":"You can drill down into\nspecific tweets and"},"1639":{"dur":4,"text":"you can understand the reach of\neach one of these campaigns."},"1644":{"dur":2,"text":"You can also look at Inbound Tweets,\npeople who are tweeting at you."},"1647":{"dur":2,"text":"In any of these cases,\nyou can understand the sentiment."},"1650":{"dur":1,"text":"All of that works out of the box."},"1651":{"dur":2,"text":"The third type is kinda interesting."},"1653":{"dur":3,"text":"It looks a little bit scary at\nfirst, but this is interesting,"},"1657":{"dur":2,"text":"because it's hard to\nvisualize a social network."},"1660":{"dur":3,"text":"So what's interesting about a social\nnetwork is what are the topics that"},"1663":{"dur":1,"text":"you're interested in?"},"1664":{"dur":1,"text":"Who is interested in those topics?"},"1666":{"dur":2,"text":"And what are the other topics that\nthose people are also interested in?"},"1668":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is a visualization that's\nactually built by Microsoft Research"},"1672":{"dur":2,"text":"using our open source\nvisualization code."},"1674":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'm just following Power BI,\nand I'm just gonna zoom out, so"},"1677":{"dur":1,"text":"you can see it put all together."},"1679":{"dur":4,"text":"So, the black dots are our\ntopics that we're following."},"1683":{"dur":1,"text":"Right in the center is Power BI."},"1684":{"dur":3,"text":"So we ran it for a couple of weeks,\nasking it to follow Power BI."},"1687":{"dur":2,"text":"The blue dots are people who\nare tweeting about Power BI and"},"1690":{"dur":1,"text":"the other clusters have blacked out,\nso"},"1691":{"dur":1,"text":"are the other topics of\nthe interest events."},"1693":{"dur":1,"text":"So as a brand or campaign manager,"},"1695":{"dur":2,"text":"I can drill into the timeline\nat the bottom and"},"1697":{"dur":3,"text":"then you'll see it organizes\nthe data very, very quickly."},"1701":{"dur":3,"text":"And then again it's very easy for\nme to see patterns."},"1704":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is something that\nhas been very, very popular."},"1707":{"dur":5,"text":"We also have a way to understand\nthe sentiment of the tweet."},"1713":{"dur":2,"text":"So we run it through some machine\nlearning algorithms that look at"},"1715":{"dur":2,"text":"your positive tweets, your negative\ntweets where they're coming from,"},"1718":{"dur":1,"text":"what are their reach, etc."},"1719":{"dur":3,"text":"And the very last one is you can\nsee how your overall campaign"},"1722":{"dur":1,"text":"performance is going."},"1723":{"dur":0,"text":"Who's tweeting?"},"1724":{"dur":0,"text":"What frequency?"},"1725":{"dur":2,"text":"You can go look at people who\nare tweeting very frequently and"},"1728":{"dur":2,"text":"what they're saying about your\nproduct or your service, or"},"1730":{"dur":1,"text":"the things that\nyou're interested in."},"1732":{"dur":1,"text":"And then the very last page,"},"1733":{"dur":3,"text":"lets you look at the output\nsorted by different factors."},"1737":{"dur":2,"text":"So, you can see what\nare the trending topics and"},"1739":{"dur":1,"text":"how they fit together."},"1740":{"dur":2,"text":"So, we've seen a lot of interest."},"1742":{"dur":2,"text":"A lot of customers follow\ntheir own products."},"1744":{"dur":2,"text":"Some of them follow their\ncompetitor's products as well, so"},"1746":{"dur":1,"text":"that they get a sense of what's\ngoing on in the industry."},"1748":{"dur":1,"text":"But again,\nall of this works end to end."},"1750":{"dur":3,"text":"You can set this up\nin about 20 minutes."},"1753":{"dur":6,"text":"So, that's what we're doing\nwith with solution templates."},"1760":{"dur":2,"text":"We are targeting the most\ncommonly deployed applications."},"1762":{"dur":3,"text":"So today, we have sales analytics\nwith Salesforce and Dynamics CRM."},"1766":{"dur":3,"text":"We have marketing analytics with\nbranded campaign management for"},"1769":{"dur":2,"text":"For finance departments\nworking on account's

our"},"2093":{"dur":1,"text":"Integrate and automatic."},"2095":{"dur":3,"text":"You're seeing a Power BI dashboard\nbut really I would say that really"},"2098":{"dur":3,"text":"underneath the Power

workhorse."},"2106":{"dur":1,"text":"Power BI is just\na visualizational error."},"2108":{"dur":0,"text":"So, what you're seeing, here,"},"2109":{"dur":3,"text":"is our analysis of all these

analyze with our solutions."},"2120":{"dur":1,"text":"All right, so it's,\nreally, the capability."},"2122":{"dur":3,"text":"So, what you're seeing here is all\nthe HVACs that we're

if a machine is about\nto achieve or go red and"},"2157":{"dur":3,"text":"there is certain threshold\nthat the machine will exceed."},"2161":{"dur":2,"text":"That machine will automatically\ntrigger a work order"},"2163":{"dur":1,"text":"in Dynamic CRM FieldOne."},"2165":{"dur":3,"text":"So that goes to a human being,\nhuman being goes to that device,"},"2168":{"dur":2,"text":"fixes that machine."},"2170":{"dur":2,"text":"So what we're trying to\ndo is really provide for"},"2173":{"dur":2,"text":"our customers a couple things."},"2176":{"dur":3,"text":"One, we're minimizing down time for\nthese devices."},"2179":{"dur":2,"text":"We're increasing the productivity\nof human beings so"},"2182":{"dur":2,"text":"in addition to a machine as\nyou're creating the work order,"},"2185":{"dur":2,"text":"the machine will also tell\nyou itself how to fix it."},"2189":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not cool, right?"},"2190":{"dur":1,"text":"So if a human being\nactually goes there,"},"2192":{"dur":1,"text":"he doesn't have to\ninterrogate that machine or"},"2194":{"dur":2,"text":"device, figure out how to fix it,"},"2196":{"dur":3,"text":"well why can't the machine just tell\nthat human being how to fix it."},"2199":{"dur":1,"text":"And so\nthat's kind of what we do, and"},"2200":{"dur":4,"text":"that really accelerates the\nproductivity, the time to fix, and"},"2204":{"dur":3,"text":"gets that machine up and\nworking quickly."},"2208":{"dur":1,"text":"So here's a couple of solutions."},"2209":{"dur":2,"text":"Here's our solution, but\nif I go to the next tab, you can go"},"2212":{"dur":3,"text":"onto a little bit more granular\ninformation about these devices."},"2219":{"dur":3,"text":"All right, so here what we do\nis we give you these age facts"},"2222":{"dur":1,"text":"which are located in buildings."},"2224":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you actually roll\nup these HVACs, well,"},"2226":{"dur":2,"text":"they're all the same buildings."},"2228":{"dur":2,"text":"So what we can also do is give\nyou the probability of failure of"},"2231":{"dur":2,"text":"a building, all right?"},"2233":{"dur":1,"text":"You think about smart buildings and"},"2235":{"dur":2,"text":"you think about building\nself-diagnosing themselves,"},"2238":{"dur":3,"text":"the capabilities that we have\nwith Azure, with Power BI and"},"2241":{"dur":2,"text":"machine learning with\nMicrosoft Technology is immense."},"2244":{"dur":2,"text":"I've been in this industry for\n20 plus years."},"2247":{"dur":3,"text":"I've never seen such rapid\ndeployment of solutions"},"2250":{"dur":3,"text":"with these cloud-based solutions\nthat Microsoft providing."},"2253":{"dur":2,"text":"It's incredible what\nMicrosoft is doing."},"2256":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'm not just saying that\nbecause we're a Microsoft partner,"},"2259":{"dur":0,"text":">> [LAUGH] Thank you."},"2260":{"dur":1,"text":">> It is pretty cool stuff."},"2261":{"dur":3,"text":"So again, if you wanted a little\nbit more granular information,"},"2264":{"dur":3,"text":"you can get information on the\nHVACs, information on the buildings."},"2267":{"dur":1,"text":"Probabilities of failure,"},"2269":{"dur":4,"text":"we can tell you how to integrate\nthat with Dynamic CRM FieldOne."},"2273":{"dur":1,"text":"We can also record the fault codes."},"2275":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, for machines about to fail,\nit triggers a fault code."},"2279":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you're an engineering\nQA department,"},"2282":{"dur":4,"text":"you can increase the quality of\nthese devices by understanding"},"2286":{"dur":3,"text":"why these machines are triggering\nthese fault codes all the time."},"2290":{"dur":2,"text":"So you wanna prevent that\nhappening in the future."},"2292":{"dur":3,"text":"All right?\nSo the solution here is wide and"},"2295":{"dur":1,"text":"deep, right?"},"2296":{"dur":1,"text":"But really doesn't have to be HVACs,"},"2298":{"dur":1,"text":"it could be really\nany type of device."},"2300":{"dur":3,"text":"But we're really giving you that\ninsight using Microsoft Azure,"},"2304":{"dur":3,"text":"using Dynamics, using Power BI,\nto apply to a real-world solution"},"2308":{"dur":2,"text":"that's really helping\nyour bottom line."},"2310":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'll just say, I've been\nin the analytics industry for"},"2313":{"dur":3,"text":"Analytics does not have\nbe a research project."},"2316":{"dur":3,"text":"It has to provide\nvalue to our customers"},"2319":{"dur":1,"text":"that hits their bottom line."},"2321":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's what customers\nreally resonate too."},"2325":{"dur":1,"text":"If I go to another slide here,"},"2327":{"dur":3,"text":"just give you a little more\nadditional information."},"2330":{"dur":4,"text":"Again, you get the idea it's really\nthat drill-down capabilities that we"},"2334":{"dur":2,"text":"have with Dynamics and\nwith Power BI."},"2336":{"dur":2,"text":"Here you're basically see\nthe temperature variants of"},"2339":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you look at AC 1000\nwhich is an air conditioner."},"2342":{"dur":2,"text":"You can see the probabilities,\nhow much,"},"2345":{"dur":2,"text":"the number of times this\nHVAC is running hot and for"},"2348":{"dur":3,"text":"HVAC is running hot, it's gonna\nconsume a lot more energy, right?"},"2351":{"dur":1,"text":"It's gonna, electricity."},"2353":{"dur":2,"text":"That electricity is gonna cost you."},"2355":{"dur":3,"text":"So you want to identify those\nmachines that are running hot."},"2358":{"dur":1,"text":"So you can identify\nthat very quickly,"},"2360":{"dur":1,"text":"so you can reduce your costs."},"2361":{"dur":2,"text":"It's all about costs and\nrevenue, right?"},"2364":{"dur":2,"text":"And so this kind of gives you just\na little bit more information."},"2366":{"dur":2,"text":"Granular information\nabout these devices."},"2368":{"dur":3,"text":"If I were to click this, again,\nyou'll get very quick information on"},"2372":{"dur":2,"text":"the temperature variance\nof these devices."},"2375":{"dur":4,"text":"So for a, machine is actually has\nhigh temperature variance is about"},"2379":{"dur":3,"text":"to fail or the probability of that\nmachine of failing is high, right?"},"2383":{"dur":3,"text":"So really what we are trying to do\nis give you proactive information so"},"2387":{"dur":2,"text":"you can actually go and fix that\ndevice as opposed to you being"},"2390":{"dur":3,"text":"reactive, right and\nthat will help your business."},"2393":{"dur":0,"text":">> Great."},"2394":{"dur":0,"text":"Well, thanks so much for your time."},"2395":{"dur":1,"text":"We look forward to working\nwith you together."},"2396":{"dur":0,"text":"We appreciate it."},"2397":{"dur":0,"text":">> Thank you."},"2398":{"dur":7,"text":">> [APPLAUSE]\n>> Can you give this to Sanchi?"},"2406":{"dur":2,"text":"So, what I wanted to do is just\nshow you a couple of other customer"},"2409":{"dur":0,"text":"examples."},"2410":{"dur":2,"text":"The next one I wanted to show\nwas some work we did with one of"},"2412":{"dur":2,"text":"the world's largest jet\nengine manufacturers."},"2415":{"dur":2,"text":"So, this is the predictive\nmaintenance application, so"},"2417":{"dur":3,"text":"let me just show you that right now."},"2427":{"dur":3,"text":"So in this case, we're working with\nthe jet engine manufacturer and"},"2430":{"dur":3,"text":"what we're doing is we're actually\nhelping them look at the status of"},"2433":{"dur":3,"text":"the different jet engines,\nthe status of the different planes."},"2437":{"dur":2,"text":"Where those planes\nare in real time and"},"2439":{"dur":2,"text":"when those planes need to be\ntaken out for maintenance, right?"},"2441":{"dur":2,"text":"So if I go into my Power BI console,\nI go in and"},"2444":{"dur":1,"text":"look at my favorite dashcodes."},"2445":{"dur":1,"text":"I go in and\nlook at aircraft solutions,"},"2447":{"dur":2,"text":"you will see that dashboard come up,\nright?"},"2449":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is the really\ninteresting problem because"},"2452":{"dur":3,"text":"the way these jet engines\nmanufacturers get paid is that they"},"2456":{"dur":2,"text":"no longer sell the engines,\nthey actually lease them out, right?"},"2459":{"dur":2,"text":"And they get paid based upon the\namount of time the engine's been in"},"2462":{"dur":1,"text":"the air, right?"},"2463":{"dur":3,"text":"So they actually play a critical\nrole in making sure the engine is"},"2466":{"dur":3,"text":"maintained on time and it's always\nin peak operating condition, right?"},"2470":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, if the engine is\nnot maintained on time,"},"2473":{"dur":3,"text":"then obviously you might\nhave a safety issue, right."},"2476":{"dur":3,"text":"However, if you pull the engine\nout for maintenance too often then"},"2479":{"dur":3,"text":"you're gonna dramatically\nimpact the probability, right?"},"2482":{"dur":2,"text":"So the choice about when you\nchoose to bring an engine out for"},"2485":{"dur":3,"text":"maintenance is a critical decision\nthat an operations engineer needs to"},"2488":{"dur":1,"text":"make, right?"},"2489":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is, you know,\nif when I'm driving my car around,"},"2492":{"dur":2,"text":"my car actually tells me when\nit needs a service, right?"},"2494":{"dur":2,"text":"However, it's much harder for\na jet engines."},"2496":{"dur":1,"text":"Cuz these engines have\nhundreds of sensors, right,"},"2498":{"dur":4,"text":"and a typical flight produces about\none to two terabytes of data, right."},"2503":{"dur":2,"text":"So working with this jet\nengine manufacturer,"},"2505":{"dur":3,"text":"we looked at the flight patterns and\nthe data coming from about 300"},"2509":{"dur":3,"text":"planes that flew over about\ntwo to three years, right?"},"2512":{"dur":2,"text":"So we had all the data coming in,\nthis massive amount of data."},"2515":{"dur":3,"text":"It went into Azure for data storage,\nand then we analyzed them with"},"2519":{"dur":3,"text":"the machine-learning algorithms\nto learn from the past behavior."},"2522":{"dur":3,"text":"When we look at the set of sensors\nwhen they reach critical thresholds,"},"2525":{"dur":2,"text":"which most likely require\nmaintenance, right?"},"2527":{"dur":3,"text":"Now even when the machine learning\nalgorithms flag it as such,"},"2531":{"dur":2,"text":"you don't just pull a jet engine\nout, take a plane out, right?"},"2534":{"dur":3,"text":"You have to make a decision on when\nis the appropriate time to pull it,"},"2537":{"dur":4,"text":"when does it need to get looked at\nby, and which is the logical point"},"2541":{"dur":3,"text":"for the you know the airport for\nyou to bring it together."},"2544":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is the dashboard that\nthe operations engineer looks at."},"2547":{"dur":3,"text":"If I go into alert status you'll be\nable to see all the data that this"},"2551":{"dur":3,"text":"particular operations\nengineer is responsible, for"},"2554":{"dur":2,"text":"the fleets that he or\nshe is responsible for."},"2557":{"dur":5,"text":"So I'm gonna make this a little\nbit bigger so you guys can see."},"2562":{"dur":2,"text":"What you'll see is I have my\n777 fleet, I have my 787 fleet,"},"2565":{"dur":1,"text":"I have my 8380 fleet."},"2566":{"dur":2,"text":"So you notice that each of these\ncircles actually represent"},"2569":{"dur":1,"text":"planes, right."},"2570":{"dur":2,"text":"And now three have been\nflagged at status red."},"2573":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, when I click on one of them,\nlet's say I clicked on the one of"},"2575":{"dur":3,"text":"the top left, you'll notice\nthat the map zooms into London."},"2579":{"dur":1,"text":"So this plane is currently\nin London, right."},"2580":{"dur":3,"text":"And the machine running algorithms\nhave flagged a number of anomalies"},"2584":{"dur":2,"text":"here that you see in issue details."},"2586":{"dur":1,"text":"So these are the ones\nthat require looking at."},"2588":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, it may or may not be an issue."},"2589":{"dur":3,"text":"The operations engineer may\ndesire to pull this plane out for"},"2593":{"dur":1,"text":"maintainence or might say,\nyou know, what,"},"2594":{"dur":2,"text":"I looked at the stuff, it doesn't\nrequire maintenance right now."},"2597":{"dur":2,"text":"Now in any of these cases, you need\nto get additional information."},"2599":{"dur":3,"text":"So the first anomaly is significant\nsecond stage engine pressure"},"2602":{"dur":1,"text":"anomaly, right?"},"2603":{"dur":1,"text":"So I click on this link and"},"2605":{"dur":4,"text":"then another Power BI report comes\nup, which is dynamically constructed"},"2609":{"dur":3,"text":"to put a set of parameters together\nthat required this machine,"},"2613":{"dur":1,"text":"this engine to be taken\noff of maintenance."},"2615":{"dur":2,"text":"So that the operations engineer can\ntake a look at those parameters and"},"2618":{"dur":2,"text":"say, hey, does this make sense?"},"2621":{"dur":2,"text":"If these parameters together\nreach these thresholds,"},"2623":{"dur":2,"text":"does it signal something\nthat needs to be looked at."},"2625":{"dur":1,"text":"So I can put my data together."},"2626":{"dur":1,"text":"We're saying, hey,"},"2628":{"dur":3,"text":"there's an 81% confidence that\nthis engine needs to be looked at."},"2631":{"dur":1,"text":"This needs to be going in for\nmaintenance."},"2632":{"dur":3,"text":"And these are the set of feature\nparameters that reach thresholds in"},"2636":{"dur":2,"text":"combination that require\nit to be looked at, right."},"2638":{"dur":1,"text":"So if I go back in, you can also\nsee where the planes are
