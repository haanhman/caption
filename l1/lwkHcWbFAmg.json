course."},"24":{"dur":5,"text":"And yes, in fact, we go back even before that,\nbecause everyone knows you're the author of"},"30":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Listening to Prozac,\" but they don't know\nthat

were both together."},"37":{"dur":1,"text":"Peter Kramer: It's good to have such an accomplished\nstudent."},"38":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: Well, thank you."},"40":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, you saved me from radiology."},"42":{"dur":1,"text":"Remember I was almost headed in that direction?"},"44":{"dur":1,"text":"Peter Kramer: I remember."},"45":{"dur":1,"text":"You thought you'd be better with people."},"46":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: With people."},"47":{"dur":1,"text":"Peter Kramer: Right."},"48":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: Okay."},"49":{"dur":1,"text":"So, great."},"50":{"dur":3,"text":"So here we are to talk about, as I said, \"Ordinarily\nWell,\" which is about antidepressants."},"54":{"dur":1,"text":"Peter Kramer: Right."},"55":{"dur":1,"text":"That controversy about antidepressants."},"57":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: And there is a lot of controversy."},"58":{"dur":5,"text":"So, just before we get to the controversy,\njust let me ask you a basic question."},"64":{"dur":2,"text":"What are antidepressants for, and what is\ndepression?"},"67":{"dur":1,"text":"Peter Kramer: Right."},"68":{"dur":2,"text":"So let's start with depression."},"70":{"dur":8,"text":"People feel hopeless, sad, they don't experience\npleasure, they have low energy."},"78":{"dur":1,"text":"Lots of other symptoms."},"79":{"dur":6,"text":"Sleep appetite, maybe suicidal, and at a level\nthat really interferes with their lives."},"85":{"dur":4,"text":"And those are sort of the modern definitions,\nbut we know depression when we see it."},"90":{"dur":6,"text":"Depression used to be diagnosed years ago\nby doctors just feeling that these patients"},"96":{"dur":7,"text":"were really sad in a way that the person sitting\nacross from the experience as very burdensome."},"104":{"dur":4,"text":"And it turns out that that condition which\nhas been recognized by humans as a disorder"},"109":{"dur":6,"text":"forever, going back to Hippocrates and melancholy,\nforever, is a multi-system disease."},"116":{"dur":4,"text":"If you have it long enough, it interferes\nwith the way you make bone, the way you make"},"120":{"dur":1,"text":"blood elements."},"121":{"dur":2,"text":"It interferes with your hormonal glands."},"124":{"dur":6,"text":"It is a true bodily multi-system disease,\nyou know, seen at that level, and it's a disorder"},"130":{"dur":3,"text":"of the mind, you know, as we experience it\nbetween people."},"134":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: Right."},"135":{"dur":1,"text":"So the brain and the mind."},"136":{"dur":4,"text":"Even though everyone knows they're effectively\nthe same thing, but different levels of analysis."},"141":{"dur":1,"text":"Peter Kramer: Right."},"142":{"dur":5,"text":"Sally: And different language and different\nways of entering those frameworks."},"148":{"dur":5,"text":"So, say a little bit about the history of\nantidepressants, and what are the antidepressants,"},"154":{"dur":1,"text":"at least that most people use today?"},"155":{"dur":5,"text":"Peter Kramer: So, for all of medical history,\ngoing back to Hippocrates, doctors have wanted"},"161":{"dur":4,"text":"to have some substance that would combat melancholy."},"166":{"dur":6,"text":"You know, this terrible, leaden, flat, you\nknow, death of the soul where people just"},"172":{"dur":4,"text":"can't get moving, can't engage in life, think\nabout killing themselves."},"176":{"dur":8,"text":"And in 1957, using a couple of different substances,\ndifferent doctors got the idea that they actually"},"184":{"dur":3,"text":"had something to hand that did this."},"187":{"dur":5,"text":"There was this doctor I write about at length\nin the book, Roland Kuhn, in Switzerland,"},"193":{"dur":4,"text":"who had a medicine that was supposed to treat\npsychosis, gave it to patients."},"198":{"dur":4,"text":"Wasn't very good, but some of the patients\ngot less depressed and he got permission to"},"203":{"dur":5,"text":"give it to depressed in-patients, out-patients,\nmore and less seriously ill people, and he"},"208":{"dur":3,"text":"realized he had an antidepressant."},"212":{"dur":5,"text":"And pretty soon there were some sense of what\nthis medicine was doing in the brain and how"},"217":{"dur":1,"text":"that might relate to mood disorders."},"219":{"dur":3,"text":"So, you know, 1957 is sort of the conventional\ndate."},"222":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: What was that called?"},"223":{"dur":1,"text":"Peter Kramer: That medicine was Imipramine."},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"Trade name was Tofranil."},"227":{"dur":1,"text":"There were others."},"229":{"dur":1,"text":"So those were in use."},"230":{"dur":5,"text":"They're still in use now, but I mean, they\nwere widely in use up through the 1980s and"},"236":{"dur":6,"text":"we started getting this new group of antidepressants\nthat had more affect on a chemical use for"},"242":{"dur":5,"text":"transmission in the brain called Serotonin,\nthat has more effect on the transmission that"},"248":{"dur":1,"text":"uses that medicine."},"249":{"dur":5,"text":"And they were medicines like Prozac and Zoloft,\nlater Celexa, which was earlier in Europe,"},"255":{"dur":1,"text":"and Lexapro."},"256":{"dur":4,"text":"So, a lot of the medicines you might have\nheard of as antidepressants started coming"},"261":{"dur":5,"text":"into use in the late '80s and 1990s, and they're\nthe ones that are mostly given now."},"266":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: You know, I worked in a clinic..."},"268":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean, I work in a methadone clinic all the\ntime, but I did some extra work last year"},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"in a more general psychiatric setting."},"276":{"dur":5,"text":"And I was referred so many people who are\ngiven the label of \"depression.\""},"281":{"dur":1,"text":"Peter Kramer: Right."},"282":{"dur":4,"text":"Sally: And yet, they actually...they didn't\nstrike me as that depressed."},"286":{"dur":1,"text":"They struck me as demoralized."},"287":{"dur":1,"text":"Peter Kramer: Yeah."},"288":{"dur":6,"text":"No, I think your gut, the experienced doctor's\ngut, is really a good way of understanding"},"295":{"dur":1,"text":"depression."},"296":{"dur":4,"text":"I think we have lots of trouble studying it\nbecause no one wants to say, \"Well, doctor,"},"300":{"dur":3,"text":"what's your gut call on this patient?\" and\nstudy that patient."},"303":{"dur":2,"text":"Everyone wants these catalogs of symptoms."},"306":{"dur":5,"text":"But yes, I think the quality of stuckness,\nthe sense that the person's perspective really"},"312":{"dur":4,"text":"is distorted, that something goes well, they\ncan't see it as going well."},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"It only reinforces the hopelessness."},"318":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's both stuckness in terms of the fixed\nnegative perspective."},"322":{"dur":5,"text":"That's very hard to emerge from, even in the\ncourse of, you know, a conversation."},"328":{"dur":5,"text":"And then the longitudinal stuckness, it just\nremains day after day."},"333":{"dur":2,"text":"And good things happen and it stays there\ndespite..."},"336":{"dur":4,"text":"Sally: So the lack of reactivity is more diagnostic\nas it were of depression."},"341":{"dur":1,"text":"Peter Kramer: Right."},"342":{"dur":5,"text":"Sally: Whereas so many of my patients were,\nas I said, I think more demoralized."},"347":{"dur":1,"text":"Their life circumstances were so chaotic."},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"A lot of these people were inner city folks."},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"Peter Kramer: Yeah, I mean, there's a whole..."},"353":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: It doesn't mean those folks can't get\ndepressed."},"355":{"dur":3,"text":"Peter Kramer: ...complicated discussion we\ncould have, because, you know, there's this"},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"dispute in the field about grief."},"361":{"dur":3,"text":"And you know, if there's a good reason for\nyou to be depressed and you have all the symptoms"},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"of depression, they last and last."},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"Is that depression or is it not?"},"368":{"dur":4,"text":"And I would say, and I think the field more\nand more is saying, it is."},"372":{"dur":5,"text":"If you do these complicated, you know, genetic\nstudies, the studies come out better if you"},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"count that as depression."},"378":{"dur":5,"text":"So just the mere fact of having a cause, I\nthink doesn't get you out of the category."},"384":{"dur":4,"text":"But yes, people sort of slip in and out, and\nthey have good days and bad days."},"388":{"dur":1,"text":"We don't want to call that depression."},"390":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: Yeah."},"391":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, you know, you just hit on a major theme\nof your book, which is that gut instinct,"},"395":{"dur":7,"text":"that clinical experience, the clinical encounter,\nversus the randomized control clinical trial."},"402":{"dur":5,"text":"Peter Kramer: So we have these very objective\nways of looking at depression, ways of measuring"},"408":{"dur":6,"text":"it, ways of doing studies where you compare\ntreatments to non-treatments, or proxies for"},"414":{"dur":3,"text":"treatment, and then inert proxies."},"417":{"dur":4,"text":"And then we have sort of what doctors see\nevery day."},"422":{"dur":3,"text":"And the question is, you know, what counts\nas evidence?"},"425":{"dur":5,"text":"And of course, nowadays, and maybe forever,\nwe value the more objective stuff more."},"430":{"dur":5,"text":"But there's sort of a benign dialectic between\nthe two, right?"},"436":{"dur":2,"text":"If the research shows something, doctors try\nit."},"439":{"dur":3,"text":"If doctors try it and it's working, there's\nmore research."},"442":{"dur":3,"text":"So that really we have kind of a complicated\nform of information."},"446":{"dur":6,"text":"But what I like to think about is, if you\nare meeting with a doctor, and you're depressed"},"453":{"dur":4,"text":"or your relative whom you love is depressed,\nand you want that to change, what do you want"},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"to inform that encounter?"},"460":{"dur":4,"text":"And to some extent it's objective research,\nto some extent you probably want some experience."},"464":{"dur":5,"text":"So, I think we could have a more complicated\nnotion of what counts as evidence."},"469":{"dur":4,"text":"Sally: The essence of a randomized clinical\ntrial, just to go back to that, is something"},"474":{"dur":6,"text":"that it's hard to assess in the clinical encounter,\nand goes to the virtue of these trials, which"},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"is placebo."},"483":{"dur":4,"text":"And the placebo issue is one with lots of\nresonance for your book."},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's just start with the fact that I think\nit inspired your book."},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"Peter Kramer: Right."},"491":{"dur":5,"text":"There was all this talk about these medicines\njust being placebos with side effects, which"},"497":{"dur":5,"text":"means dummy pills that make you feel like\nyou're on a drug, and you're not getting better"},"502":{"dur":4,"text":"because of the inherent efficacy of the drug\nbecause of the way the drug interacts with"},"506":{"dur":4,"text":"your brain, it alters it and allows you to\nbehave differently, the whole complicated"},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"series of things that may inform recovery."},"513":{"dur":6,"text":"No, the claim was, any pill, a sugar pill\nwould do the same thing, if you believe it"},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"was an antidepressant."},"521":{"dur":5,"text":"And that claim, I think, started causing doctors,\neven though these medicines are widely prescribed"},"527":{"dur":4,"text":"in critical situations, not to turn to the\nmedicines when I would say they should."},"531":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that is a canard."},"532":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't think depression is very placebo responsive."},"536":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, I think we want to distinguish two\nthings."},"540":{"dur":5,"text":"To know that the medicines work, what we'd\nlike to do is set up a situation where we"},"545":{"dur":5,"text":"see how people do on the medicine and we see\nwhat's causing the hypothetical counterfactual"},"550":{"dur":6,"text":"\"What would have happened if they had the\nsame weather, the same spouse, the same contact"},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"with doctors, but didn't get the active ingredient\nin the drug?\""},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"So, how would they do without treatment?"},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"How do they do with treatment?"},"565":{"dur":6,"text":"And that gets confused with this much more\nparticular idea, which is people get better"},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"because they have faith in a pill."},"573":{"dur":4,"text":"That seems to me a much narrower belief, and\nthere's a lot less evidence for that."},"578":{"dur":7,"text":"Sally: But some people do get better, surprisingly\nbetter, with social stimulation and connection."},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"Peter Kramer: Right."},"586":{"dur":5,"text":"Sally: I remember seeing a patient who I thought\nfor sure would need shock therapy."},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, that's how almost immobilized this\nwoman was."},"595":{"dur":1,"text":"She lived with her mother."},"597":{"dur":4,"text":"It was almost like a \"Now, Voyager\" situation\nwhere she lived with her mother well into"},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"her adult life, and the mother died."},"604":{"dur":4,"text":"And on the one hand, of course she found it\nliberating, but there was an enormous burden"},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"that came with it."},"611":{"dur":7,"text":"That was the first visit and then she of course\nwas coming back, and I thought \"For sure we"},"619":{"dur":1,"text":"need hospitalization.\""},"620":{"dur":1,"text":"She was living with a sister otherwise."},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"I thought maybe we'd need it that day."},"625":{"dur":5,"text":"But I was shocked at how she could rally a\nbit."},"630":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, I hate to admit, she dropped out."},"633":{"dur":3,"text":"So, she may well have relapsed into that."},"637":{"dur":1,"text":"Peter Kramer: Yeah."},"638":{"dur":1,"text":"But maybe not, right?"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, I think we see this."},"641":{"dur":6,"text":"The reason we as psychiatrists like to sit\nwith people a while is that if you can...you"},"648":{"dur":5,"text":"know, it's not urgent, you don't have to worry\nabout suicide immediately or loss of a job,"},"653":{"dur":6,"text":"or divorce, whatever it is, and you have a\nlittle time to sit, sometimes you find listening,"},"659":{"dur":7,"text":"supporting, teasing things apart, passage\nof time, people get remarkably better."},"666":{"dur":4,"text":"People got better from depression, sometimes,\nbefore anyone invented..."},"671":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: Yeah, and that doesn't mean it's any\nless real."},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"Peter Kramer: No, no."},"673":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's why..."},"674":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: Although, I think people can think\nit's any less real."},"675":{"dur":1,"text":"Peter Kramer: That's why you want to do these\ntrials, right?"},"677":{"dur":3,"text":"Because when you have people come in, you\ntake their blood pressure, you talk to them,"},"681":{"dur":3,"text":"you ask them about their depression, do a\nlong inventory, spend a lot of time with them"},"684":{"dur":5,"text":"week after week in the course of a drug trial,\nmaybe it's all that human contact that's helping."},"689":{"dur":6,"text":"Maybe I take people in the book to a drug\ntrial center and I go out in the van."},"696":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, the van picks people up where they\nlive and brings them to the center."},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"And just the conversation in the van is very\nsupportive."},"703":{"dur":5,"text":"So, lots of things go on in a drug trial and\nwe don't want to attribute that kind of benefit,"},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"if it's beneficial, to the drug."},"711":{"dur":3,"text":"We want to know what is the drug doing beyond\nall that human contact."},"715":{"dur":5,"text":"Sally: So when you see a patient, unless you\nthink someone is suicidal and you have to"},"720":{"dur":6,"text":"act in an emergent way, do you have kind of\nan intuitive algorithm?"},"727":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean, I don't think you rip out your prescription\npad on the first visit."},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"Or maybe you do sometimes."},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"Peter Kramer: I mean, I do."},"736":{"dur":3,"text":"I think that, to some extent, I'm the instrument."},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"And I ask myself, \"How worried am I?\""},"742":{"dur":5,"text":"If I, as the conversation progress, get more\nand more alarmed, you know, I take that to"},"748":{"dur":5,"text":"be a reason for a question or possibly action."},"754":{"dur":6,"text":"Whereas if things look bad at first and as\nwe talk I get a sense of some reasons why"},"760":{"dur":7,"text":"things are happening and some flickers of\nresponsiveness, some human connection, then"},"767":{"dur":4,"text":"I think, \"Well, we can...if we're to be a\nlittle patient, maybe we're gonna do some"},"772":{"dur":2,"text":"good along the way.\""},"774":{"dur":5,"text":"And not to say that I may not reach for the\nprescription pad at a certain moment, to me,"},"780":{"dur":4,"text":"you know, we know that this is a disorder\nthat is destructive in itself, that people"},"785":{"dur":1,"text":"start losing memory."},"786":{"dur":4,"text":"There are extraordinary studies you don't\nwanna know the answer to, where people stay"},"790":{"dur":4,"text":"depressed for a long time and their risk of\nthe next episode is greater, the downstream"},"795":{"dur":3,"text":"episodes tend to be more complicated, they\nneed more treatment."},"798":{"dur":2,"text":"You'd like to interrupt an episode of depression."},"801":{"dur":5,"text":"And I think, to me, the measure of the utility\nof a treatment is that it works."},"806":{"dur":10,"text":"I know that sounds, you know, sort of circular,\nbut it's remarkable how often people don't"},"816":{"dur":1,"text":"appreciate that."},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"They say, \"I believe in yoga and meditation.\""},"820":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, that's fine, but is your depression\nretreating or is it progressing?"},"824":{"dur":5,"text":"If it's progressing, maybe it's time for one\nof these much better tested remedies like"},"829":{"dur":2,"text":"psychotherapy or medication, or both."},"831":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: Right."},"832":{"dur":1,"text":"And the ideas..."},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, I thought you challenged this a bit\nin your book."},"837":{"dur":2,"text":"The idea was that they actually had a synergistic\naffect."},"840":{"dur":1,"text":"Peter Kramer: Yeah."},"841":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: And you seemed a little skeptical of\nthat."},"842":{"dur":5,"text":"Peter Kramer: Well, you know, I think the\nmain thing I'm doing in the book..."},"847":{"dur":3,"text":"First of all, I want to say this is a complicated\nbook, I hope, in a good way."},"851":{"dur":1,"text":"It has a lot of history."},"853":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: It's very readable."},"854":{"dur":1,"text":"It's incredibly readable."},"855":{"dur":1,"text":"Peter Kramer: That's what I want to hear."},"856":{"dur":2,"text":"I worked so hard at getting it readable."},"859":{"dur":4,"text":"And there's some technical things in it but\nI do a lot of storytelling, both from the"},"863":{"dur":5,"text":"history of psychiatry and for my practice,\nand sort of the intersection, my time spent"},"869":{"dur":4,"text":"with some of the pioneers in the field who\nwere developing understanding of depression"},"873":{"dur":2,"text":"and depression treatment."},"876":{"dur":7,"text":"So I tried to put everything in a very humane,\nI hope, context."},"884":{"dur":3,"text":"But also to look at some of the fallacies."},"887":{"dur":5,"text":"It seems to me that there are a lot of attacks\non antidepressants, some of them very legitimate,"},"892":{"dur":4,"text":"based on things drug companies have done that\ncross ethical lines."},"897":{"dur":5,"text":"But attacks that really come, I think, from\na misguided sense that attacking antidepressants"},"903":{"dur":6,"text":"defends psychotherapy or defends humane approaches\nto illness, which I think is not the case."},"910":{"dur":5,"text":"And so that a lot of the book is saying, if\nwe were going to talk about objective evidence,"},"916":{"dur":1,"text":"what's objective?"},"917":{"dur":1,"text":"What's good evidence?"},"918":{"dur":3,"text":"And the truth is, if you like the evidence\nfor exercise, diet and whatever, you're gonna"},"922":{"dur":1,"text":"love the evidence for psychotherapy."},"924":{"dur":1,"text":"It's much stronger."},"925":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm sorry, I was gonna say for pharmacology,\ntrue for psychotherapy also."},"929":{"dur":6,"text":"And that particular question of the intersection,\ndoes it help to combine medication and psychotherapy,"},"936":{"dur":1,"text":"I think it does."},"937":{"dur":1,"text":"It's what I do."},"938":{"dur":4,"text":"If I'm medicating patients, I'm seeing them\noften, I'm trying to puzzle out what's going"},"943":{"dur":2,"text":"on in their lives with them."},"945":{"dur":4,"text":"But it turns out to be actually very hard\nto show that the combination is a lot better"},"950":{"dur":3,"text":"than medication alone, partly because medication\ndoes pretty well."},"954":{"dur":5,"text":"Sally: Actually, that brings me to my next\nquestion, which is, can you actually put a"},"959":{"dur":2,"text":"number on the effectiveness?"},"962":{"dur":3,"text":"Peter Kramer: It turns out to be very hard."},"965":{"dur":4,"text":"Let me tell you the main problem with putting\na number on these drugs work."},"970":{"dur":6,"text":"And when you have a drug that works, and they're\ngeneric and you can get them on Medicaid,"},"976":{"dur":5,"text":"and you can get them in HMOs and so on, a\ndoctor who's ethical, facing a patient with"},"982":{"dur":6,"text":"serious depression, where the moment arises\nto prescribe, will prescribe a medicine, not"},"988":{"dur":3,"text":"send the person to a drug trial where he or\nshe might get a placebo."},"992":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's very hard to get a good collection\nof patients."},"996":{"dur":2,"text":"There's some astonishingly good effects."},"998":{"dur":4,"text":"There was an open trial in Sweden, in primary\ncare clinics, and it was sort of a select"},"1003":{"dur":1,"text":"group of people."},"1004":{"dur":1,"text":"They weren't suicidal, they weren't alcoholic."},"1005":{"dur":3,"text":"They just had, you know, probably fairly easy\nto treat depression."},"1009":{"dur":5,"text":"And at the end of six months...over 90% of\npeople on a routine antidepressant."},"1015":{"dur":2,"text":"It was Celexa."},"1018":{"dur":1,"text":"Citalopram."},"1019":{"dur":2,"text":"Had at least half of their symptoms remit."},"1022":{"dur":2,"text":"So they were somewhat better."},"1024":{"dur":7,"text":"So, you know, probably numbers in the 60%,\n70% range for the first thing offered or more"},"1032":{"dur":1,"text":"reasonable."},"1033":{"dur":4,"text":"There's a funny number, 30%, that we read\na lot."},"1038":{"dur":5,"text":"That 30% came from a study of patients who\nhad been depressed 15 years, they were in"},"1043":{"dur":5,"text":"the seventh or eighth episode of depression,\nthey were two years into an episode of depression,"},"1048":{"dur":2,"text":"they hadn't responded to other treatments."},"1050":{"dur":4,"text":"Most of them were also alcoholic or had another\nmental illness."},"1054":{"dur":6,"text":"And 30% of them, in the first medicine given,\nended the episode of depression."},"1061":{"dur":3,"text":"Which was considered not a good outcome, but\nI think it's a pretty good outcome."},"1064":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: And it's a pretty refractory group."},"1065":{"dur":3,"text":"Peter Kramer: In that tough group there are\nother studies...there's another wonderful"},"1069":{"dur":2,"text":"study where doctors were allowed to do their\nworst."},"1072":{"dur":3,"text":"Just, you know, change the medicine, add medicine,\njust do whatever you need."},"1075":{"dur":5,"text":"And you could take a group that looks like\nthat, and most of them would leave an episode"},"1081":{"dur":2,"text":"of depression and stay well for six months."},"1083":{"dur":9,"text":"Sally: The initial excitement, and the continued\npopularity of these Selective Serotonin Reuptake"},"1093":{"dur":5,"text":"Inhibitors, which is the class that
