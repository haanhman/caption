question,"},"2187":{"dur":2,"text":"they don't take VC money."},"2190":{"dur":3,"text":"So the money comes from users."},"2193":{"dur":2,"text":"So for example,\nFairmondo put a cap"},"2196":{"dur":3,"text":"on 20,000 euros per investor."},"2199":{"dur":2,"text":"And they are users of the site."},"2202":{"dur":1,"text":"So they are members\nof the co-op."},"2204":{"dur":3,"text":"So they get their capital\nfrom members, not from VC."},"2207":{"dur":2,"text":"So there is no\ncontrolling influence."},"2210":{"dur":2,"text":"AUDIENCE: Yeah, let

Denver?"},"2216":{"dur":0,"text":"TREBOR SCHOLZ: Oh, [INAUDIBLE]."},"2217":{"dur":0,"text":"AUDIENCE: Because\nUber could say,"},"2218":{"dur":2,"text":"hey, free rides for everybody\nfor the next five years,"},"2220":{"dur":2,"text":"because it's powered\nby VC capital."},"2223":{"dur":1,"text":"And then Green Taxi\ndies, and Uber lives."},"2225":{"dur":1,"text":"How do you prevent that?"},"2226":{"dur":1,"text":"TREBOR SCHOLZ: Yeah, right."},"2227":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, you can't\nprevent that, but you"},"2230":{"dur":3,"text":"can look at markets\nand industries"},"2233":{"dur":2,"text":"in which this model could be\nmore successful than in others."},"2236":{"dur":3,"text":"For example, in the United\nStates as much as in Europe,"},"2239":{"dur":4,"text":"home health care is a huge issue\nwhere this model could really"},"2244":{"dur":1,"text":"succeed very well."},"2246":{"dur":1,"text":"But you see it also in Denver."},"2247":{"dur":2,"text":"There are cities,\nlike Austin, right?"},"2250":{"dur":1,"text":"In Austin, there are several."},"2251":{"dur":3,"text":"There are platform\nco-ops and also a

fact."},"2264":{"dur":0,"text":"For example, Italy."},"2265":{"dur":7,"text":"So the Italian government\njust informed us"},"2273":{"dur":1,"text":"that they are basically\nfinancing a study"},"2275":{"dur":4,"text":"to see if platinum co-ops could\nbe rolled out all over Italy."},"2279":{"dur":5,"text":"Because Uber announced that\nthey will leave the country."},"2285":{"dur":2,"text":"So you know, I guess\nlike one answer"},"2287":{"dur":4,"text":"to that would be in niches\nwhere they are not competing"},"2292":{"dur":2,"text":"or in niches where\nthey don't operate."},"2295":{"dur":2,"text":"It's, of course, I\nwould think this."},"2297":{"dur":2,"text":"The idea here is not\nto destroy Uber, right?"},"2300":{"dur":1,"text":"I hope I

interesting,"},"2324":{"dur":1,"text":"because it had a\nworker-ownership model."},"2326":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't know if\nyou followed this."},"2327":{"dur":2,"text":"So they basically\nsaid if drivers"},"2329":{"dur":4,"text":"have a high performance, they\nwill own part of the company."},"2334":{"dur":5,"text":"Only problem is that they\nthen were purchased by Gett"},"2340":{"dur":1,"text":"and betrayed the workers."},"2341":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is not really\nhappening anymore."},"2345":{"dur":1,"text":"So we deleted them\nfrom our website."},"2350":{"dur":2,"text":"But you know, there\nare dozens of companies"},"2352":{"dur":4,"text":"that do operate, like\nCotabo in Italy, ETX."},"2356":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, there are\nmany examples--"},"2358":{"dur":1,"text":"Austin Rides."},"2360":{"dur":2,"text":"AUDIENCE: The thing that\nstuck out to me about this--"},"2362":{"dur":3,"text":"because I think it's easy to\nargue that over time overall,"},"2366":{"dur":1,"text":"it's cheaper for everyone."},"2368":{"dur":2,"text":"But there's a minimum\nbuy in for people"},"2370":{"dur":2,"text":"who want to be part\nof these co-ops."},"2372":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'm wondering how\nthat affects something"},"2374":{"dur":4,"text":"you talked about earlier, which\nis whose problems are getting"},"2378":{"dur":1,"text":"solved by these things."},"2379":{"dur":0,"text":"You mentioned Up & Go."},"2380":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't know if\nthat's an example."},"2383":{"dur":1,"text":"TREBOR SCHOLZ: Well,\nyou know, there"},"2384":{"dur":1,"text":"are lots of different\nways of funding these."},"2386":{"dur":3,"text":"So like Up & Go was funded\nthrough foundation and a bank,"},"2390":{"dur":2,"text":"So Barclays Bank\nand the Robin Hood"},"2393":{"dur":1,"text":"Foundation here in New York."},"2394":{"dur":1,"text":"[INAUDIBLE] a\nfoundation that aims"},"2396":{"dur":5,"text":"at alleviating poverty in New\nYork City invested in that."},"2402":{"dur":3,"text":"And then there are, you\nknow, blockchain schemes"},"2405":{"dur":4,"text":"where people basically tried\nto find new funding ways."},"2409":{"dur":5,"text":"We are just about to create a\nplot from co-op crypto token"},"2414":{"dur":6,"text":"to basically allow people\nin the crypto token system"},"2421":{"dur":2,"text":"to invest in this model as well."},"2424":{"dur":2,"text":"AUDIENCE: Wouldn't that lead\nto situations like Juno,"},"2427":{"dur":1,"text":"though, if you're\ngetting external funding,"},"2429":{"dur":2,"text":"but you want people to\nbe owning the company?"},"2431":{"dur":1,"text":"TREBOR SCHOLZ: Not really."},"2432":{"dur":1,"text":"AUDIENCE: OK."},"2434":{"dur":4,"text":"AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was wondering\nif you could talk about kind"},"2438":{"dur":4,"text":"of where a co-op might not\nbe the best thing where kind"},"2443":{"dur":1,"text":"of a larger company where you--"},"2445":{"dur":1,"text":"TREBOR SCHOLZ: Right, yeah."},"2446":{"dur":2,"text":"AUDIENCE: I mean, when I think\nabout Uber, the thing that's"},"2448":{"dur":2,"text":"nice about it is I can go\nalmost anywhere and use it."},"2451":{"dur":3,"text":"Whereas, these co-ops, you\nseem to be kind of focused"},"2454":{"dur":3,"text":"in smaller areas rather than\nkind of a large extended co-op."},"2458":{"dur":1,"text":"TREBOR SCHOLZ: Well,\nit depends, right?"},"2459":{"dur":2,"text":"So yeah, I agree with you."},"2461":{"dur":5,"text":"So the most sensible\nareas would be"},"2467":{"dur":2,"text":"I think where research\nand development is not"},"2469":{"dur":1,"text":"very extensive."},"2471":{"dur":3,"text":"So probably not in\nautomated cars, right?"},"2475":{"dur":2,"text":"Probably not in\nself-driving cars."},"2478":{"dur":3,"text":"So you know, I mean,\ndevelopment of AI i"},"2481":{"dur":4,"text":"would not place on small\ncooperatives, right?"},"2486":{"dur":3,"text":"But even in that discussion, it\nwould be interesting to see--"},"2489":{"dur":1,"text":"and there are\nalready cooperatives"},"2491":{"dur":5,"text":"that actually contribute to\nthe research of AI companies."},"2496":{"dur":2,"text":"They are not doing\nit themselves,"},"2498":{"dur":1,"text":"but they are part\nof this picture."},"2500":{"dur":2,"text":"They're trying to insert\nthemselves in there."},"2502":{"dur":1,"text":"That was your first question."},"2503":{"dur":1,"text":"But then you had the second one?"},"2505":{"dur":0,"text":"AUDIENCE: Oh, no."},"2506":{"dur":1,"text":"That was kind of my--"},"2507":{"dur":0,"text":"TREBOR SCHOLZ: Yeah, yeah."},"2508":{"dur":1,"text":"No, I completely agree with you."},"2509":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is why areas, for\nexample, like, you know,"},"2512":{"dur":1,"text":"home health care,\nlike I say it again."},"2514":{"dur":5,"text":"You know, we saw it being very\nsuccessful in the Netherlands,"},"2520":{"dur":4,"text":"you know, where basically groups\nof nurses form cooperatives,"},"2524":{"dur":6,"text":"create websites with services\nlike prenatal care for Latino"},"2530":{"dur":0,"text":"women."},"2531":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, there's\nthis [INAUDIBLE],,"},"2532":{"dur":2,"text":"for example, done here\nin Southern California"},"2535":{"dur":4,"text":"where these nurses traditionally\nthrough temp agencies"},"2539":{"dur":2,"text":"would pay 50% to\nthe temp agency."},"2542":{"dur":2,"text":"And now they have a\nvery different situation"},"2545":{"dur":3,"text":"when they run their own\noperation like that."},"2548":{"dur":4,"text":"So there are clear advantages\nfor particular groups I think."},"2552":{"dur":0,"text":"So, yeah."},"2553":{"dur":1,"text":"AUDIENCE: One other\ndifferent question."},"2555":{"dur":3,"text":"You kind of mentioned that\nthere would be this ideal co-op"},"2558":{"dur":1,"text":"platform kernel."},"2559":{"dur":0,"text":"TREBOR SCHOLZ: Yeah."},"2560":{"dur":2,"text":"AUDIENCE: And we make platforms\nhere a little bit sometimes."},"2563":{"dur":1,"text":"TREBOR SCHOLZ: I've\nheard about that."},"2564":{"dur":0,"text":"AUDIENCE: Yeah."},"2565":{"dur":2,"text":"What kind of main\nfeatures do you"},"2567":{"dur":2,"text":"think would exist in\nthis type of platform?"},"2569":{"dur":1,"text":"TREBOR SCHOLZ: Absolutely."},"2570":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, it's really\nfor apps, right?"},"2574":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, it's one worker\nfacing, one client facing,"},"2579":{"dur":2,"text":"for iOS and for Android."},"2581":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's really like four apps\nthat you would have to demo"},"2583":{"dur":0,"text":"and have to develop."},"2584":{"dur":4,"text":"And then they would have to\nplug into different applications"},"2589":{"dur":1,"text":"locally, right?"},"2590":{"dur":4,"text":"So it would just be the\nkernel, and then local."},"2594":{"dur":2,"text":"So you know, it would\nbe somebody [INAUDIBLE]"},"2597":{"dur":1,"text":"what you would\nconsider small grant,"},"2598":{"dur":3,"text":"I would consider an\nenormous grant for this."},"2602":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we tried to\nmake a dent in that"},"2604":{"dur":4,"text":"and actually hope to have this\ndone in the next two years."},"2608":{"dur":2,"text":"So I mean, if any of you\nare interested in this"},"2611":{"dur":1,"text":"and think that they would\nlike to support this,"},"2613":{"dur":2,"text":"we would, of course,\nhighly welcome that."},"2615":{"dur":4,"text":"AUDIENCE: I had a question\nabout policy changes--"},"2619":{"dur":0,"text":"TREBOR SCHOLZ: Yeah."},"2620":{"dur":3,"text":"AUDIENCE: --that could\nencourage more co-ops or level"},"2624":{"dur":3,"text":"the playing field or take\na holistic approach to--"},"2627":{"dur":2,"text":"TREBOR SCHOLZ: Absolutely."},"2629":{"dur":3,"text":"AUDIENCE: --creating, you know,\na world that results in more"},"2633":{"dur":1,"text":"co-ops or whatever\nthat would be--"},"2635":{"dur":1,"text":"TREBOR SCHOLZ: No, absolute."},"2636":{"dur":0,"text":"or if you have anything\nto say about that."},"2637":{"dur":0,"text":"TREBOR SCHOLZ: Yeah."},"2638":{"dur":3,"text":"No, so part of what this\norganization, the PCC,"},"2641":{"dur":2,"text":"the Platform Cooperatives\nand Consortium does"},"2644":{"dur":1,"text":"is we write policy\nbriefs for senators."},"2649":{"dur":5,"text":"And I don't know, in October,\nwe talked to the G7 about this."},"2654":{"dur":2,"text":"And you know, we wrote\none for Kirsten Gillibrand"},"2657":{"dur":1,"text":"who requested one."},"2659":{"dur":2,"text":"Because Kirsten Gillibrand\nand Bernie Sanders"},"2661":{"dur":5,"text":"created this package on May 11,\nI think, they released that,"},"2666":{"dur":6,"text":"where they proposed a large\npush for cooperatives."},"2672":{"dur":4,"text":"And so I think the\ninterventions are mostly"},"2677":{"dur":1,"text":"on the municipal level, right?"},"2679":{"dur":5,"text":"I wouldn't have all too much\nhope on the federal level"},"2684":{"dur":4,"text":"at least for the next\nfour years, and so there."},"2689":{"dur":3,"text":"But I think you can work with\ncities very much so hoping"},"2692":{"dur":4,"text":"to bring about local legislation\nthat is in favor of that."},"2697":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's a\nwhole sort of list."},"2698":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, I have in\nfact even a slide--"},"2700":{"dur":1,"text":"I can show it to\nyou afterwards--"},"2702":{"dur":2,"text":"which lists the things\nthat we're proposing,"},"2704":{"dur":4,"text":"like a revolving loan fund for\nplatforms co-ops town hall."},"2709":{"dur":5,"text":"Set up townhalls to\ndiscuss these issues"},"2714":{"dur":2,"text":"and many other things."},"2717":{"dur":3,"text":"The problem with\nAmerican policy is"},"2721":{"dur":3,"text":"that it's relatively\nfriendly to monopolies,"},"2724":{"dur":2,"text":"but it's really\nhostile to cartels."},"2726":{"dur":2,"text":"And something like\nMondragon, which is really"},"2729":{"dur":3,"text":"a network of cooperatives, would\ndefinitely be seen as a cartel"},"2732":{"dur":2,"text":"and would not be tolerated."},"2735":{"dur":4,"text":"So you have to find\nways to influence
