raided"},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"and goes in and bags himself\na new pair of trainers."},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, he texts one of his friends\nand says, you know,"},"415":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Come on down to the riots.\""},"416":{"dur":1,"text":"So his friend joins him,"},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"and then the two of them\ntext more of their friends"},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"who join them\nand text more of their friends"},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"and more and more and so it continues."},"425":{"dur":3,"text":"This process is identical to the way\nthat a virus spreads through a

people that got infected\nand the faster the virus spread"},"437":{"dur":3,"text":"before the authorities managed\nto get a handle on events."},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's exactly the same process here."},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"So, okay, let's say you've got a rioter,"},"446":{"dur":1,"text":"he's decided he's going to riot,"},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"the next thing he has to do\nis pick a riot site."},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"What you should know about rioters"},"457":{"dur":3,"text":"is that they're not really prepared\nto travel that far"},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"from where they live\nunless is a really juicy riot site."},"462":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can see that here, from this graph"},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"that an awful lot of rioters\nhaving traveled less than a kilometer"},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"to the site that they went to."},"471":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, this pattern is seen\nin consumer models of retail spending,"},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"i.e. where we choose to go shopping."},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"So, of course,\npeople like to go to local shops"},"480":{"dur":3,"text":"but you'd be prepared\nto go a little bit further"},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"if it was a really good retail site."},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"And this anology actually was already\npicked up by some of the papers,"},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"with some tabloid press"},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"calling the events\n\"Shopping with violence\""},"492":{"dur":3,"text":"which probably sums it up\nin terms of our research."},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"Oh, I'm going backwards."},"500":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, step three.\nFinally, the rioter is at his site"},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"and now he wants to avoid\ngetting caught by the police."},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"The rioters will avoid\nthe police at all times"},"510":{"dur":3,"text":"but there is some safety in numbers,\nand on the flip side"},"513":{"dur":1,"text":"the police with their limited resources,"},"515":{"dur":2,"text":"are trying to protect\nas much of the city as possible,"},"518":{"dur":3,"text":"arrest rioters wherever possible\nand to create a deterrent effect."},"526":{"dur":4,"text":"Actually, as it turns out,\nthis mechanism between the two species,"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"so to speak, of of rioters and the police"},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"is identical to predators\nand prey in the wild;"},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"so if you can imagine rabbits and foxes,"},"536":{"dur":3,"text":"rabbits are trying to avoid\nfoxes at all costs,"},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"while foxes are patrolling the space"},"541":{"dur":1,"text":"trying to look for rabbits."},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"We actually know an awful lot\nabout the dynamics of predators and prey,"},"546":{"dur":4,"text":"we also know a lot about\nthe consumer spending flows"},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"and we know a lot about"},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"how viruses spread through a population."},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"So, if you take these three analogies\ntogether and exploit them"},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"you can come up with a mathematical model"},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"of what actually happened,"},"561":{"dur":2,"text":"that's capable of replicating\nthe general patterns"},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"of the riots themselves."},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"Once we've got this,\nwe can almost use this as a petri dish"},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"to start having conversations\nabout which areas of the city"},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"were more susceptible than others"},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"and what police tactics could be used"},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"if this were ever to happen again\nin future."},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"Even twenty years ago\nmodelling of this sort"},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"was completely unheard of,\nbut I think that these analogies"},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"are an incredibly important tool"},"586":{"dur":3,"text":"in tackling problems with our society\nand perhaps,"},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"ultimately improving our society overall."},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"So,
