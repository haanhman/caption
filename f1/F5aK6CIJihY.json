in our next TMA,\nfor example, and that's"},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"where the students get really\nfrustrated that reflection"},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"and being asked to\nconstantly reflect on things"},"226":{"dur":1,"text":"is really boring\nand dull, and they"},"227":{"dur":1,"text":"don't know why they're\nbeing asked to do it,"},"229":{"dur":1,"text":"because they actually\nhaven't

two, three key things\nthat they need to think about"},"292":{"dur":1,"text":"in order to develop\ntheir next TMA,"},"294":{"dur":2,"text":"because if you try\nand change

I think it's a critical\naspect of reflection."},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"It's the idea of\nlooking or reflecting"},"322":{"dur":1,"text":"through different lenses."},"324":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you look at the\nTMA mark, for example,"},"328":{"dur":3,"text":"through the lens of, what\ndoes this tell me about me"},"331":{"dur":3,"text":"as a student, then I think\nthat form of reflection"},"334":{"dur":3,"text":"will give you one way\nof thinking about it."},"338":{"dur":3,"text":"So you may have a set\nof informal success"},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"criteria, which\nare your

of\nlens, if you like."},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"And it leads to a different\nset of reflections."},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"So reflection in\nand of itself needs"},"387":{"dur":4,"text":"to be thought of as\na means for learning,"},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"a means for filtering feedback."},"394":{"dur":2,"text":"I guess we need to think\nabout the kind of criteria"},"396":{"dur":1,"text":"that we're

to talk about\nhow we do that, because that's"},"410":{"dur":1,"text":"what everyone wants\nto know, because this"},"412":{"dur":1,"text":"is such an emotive subject."},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean Joan says\nthat if she doesn't"},"415":{"dur":1,"text":"get the mark that\nshe wants, she just"},"416":{"dur":1,"text":"feels like packing it all in."},"418":{"dur":1,"text":"And in terms of the\nwidget responses"},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"that we had for\nstudents, 78% of them"},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"said that the first thing\nthat they look at is the mark."},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"Only

key."},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"And can they remember something\npositive and negative?"},"443":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, 36% the negative,\nand only 15% of students"},"446":{"dur":1,"text":"said that they

we interpret that\nfeedback is critical."},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"I think where\nreflection comes in"},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"and how we mitigate\nthat process is"},"506":{"dur":6,"text":"by suspending your\ninitial response,"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"and then asking questions of it."},"514":{"dur":1,"text":"For example, you\nmight ask a question,"},"516":{"dur":3,"text":"is my response to

personal sense."},"671":{"dur":1,"text":"And similarly,\nI'm an OU student,"},"673":{"dur":1,"text":"and there has been\nfeedback, where"},"675":{"dur":3,"text":"I literally just thought I\nwant the
