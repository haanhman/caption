off."},"139":{"dur":1,"text":"But this is actually cold."},"141":{"dur":1,"text":"It feels like a refridgerator cold."},"142":{"dur":6,"text":"It's not just routing it from the A\/C because\nthe A\/C right now is set to 72."},"149":{"dur":2,"text":"And it is called a Cool Box."},"151":{"dur":4,"text":"It is not a refridgerator because it does\ncut off when the car cuts

there."},"385":{"dur":5,"text":"See the little dots on the bumper and that's\npark assist."},"390":{"dur":6,"text":"That's the sensor that beeps if you get too\nclose to something at parking lot

right\nnow."},"431":{"dur":6,"text":"And what I did there to make it go up and\ndown is I flipped a switch that's in the center"},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"console."},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"Move that up and down."},"441":{"dur":4,"text":"That will adjust the height of the LX up and\ndown."},"445":{"dur":7,"text":"And that's mainly for adjusting for ride terrain\nbut its also for adjusting load

allowing you easier access into the"},"466":{"dur":1,"text":"back."},"467":{"dur":3,"text":"You can see that you have a seat that's folded\nagainst the wall and then one that's in the"},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"down position."},"471":{"dur":5,"text":"And the way you control those seats is right\nhere."},"477":{"dur":1,"text":"Along this little bank of buttons."},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's for the right side."},"481":{"dur":1,"text":"That's for the left side."},"482":{"dur":3,"text":"And so what you're going to do is you're going\nto start on this side."},"485":{"dur":4,"text":"If the seat is in the up position against\nthe wall, you're going to start in this furthest"},"490":{"dur":3,"text":"left position and you're going to hold it."},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"And that will drop the seat down."},"496":{"dur":7,"text":"And that'll bring, I'm pushing it right to\nbring the seat back up."},"504":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay."},"505":{"dur":5,"text":"So, that's for down, that's for up."},"511":{"dur":9,"text":"Once its in the down position and locked into\nthe floor, you can pull this tab

push that forward."},"536":{"dur":6,"text":"Then you can take this button, the far right\none and you can press that down."},"542":{"dur":5,"text":"That's going to fold it and then you're going\nto press this tab on the right side of that"},"547":{"dur":8,"text":"toggle."},"556":{"dur":13,"text":"And once it does the double beep, that indicates\nthat it's securely against the

this is just luxury to the\nmax."},"586":{"dur":15,"text":"And then you have your dvd players right there."},"602":{"dur":18,"text":"And then you can actually take this screen\nand tilt it way out."},"620":{"dur":3,"text":"Extremely nice."},"623":{"dur":4,"text":"You also have inputs down here in this panel."},"628":{"dur":7,"text":"You can see there in that panel, you have\nHDMI input, you have an auxiliary port for"},"635":{"dur":4,"text":"power and then you have volume control for\nyour headrest."},"639":{"dur":6,"text":"Those are 21 inch wheels."},"646":{"dur":6,"text":"And these are sitting on Dunlop 275\/50- 21."},"653":{"dur":9,"text":"Those are big wheels and those are an option\nbut I can't imagine an LX without that wheel."},"662":{"dur":6,"text":"To start it up you just have the key on your\nperson, put your foot on the brake and tap"},"669":{"dur":1,"text":"the button."},"671":{"dur":5,"text":"What a gorgeous vehicle."},"676":{"dur":7,"text":"You've got your 12.3 inch navigation screen."},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"That display is absolutely incredible."},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"The analog clock and that is GPS enabled."},"689":{"dur":4,"text":"In other words, if you cross a time zone,\nit can reset automatically."},"694":{"dur":4,"text":"And you have your climate vents right there\nto the left or right of the clock."},"698":{"dur":4,"text":"And then you've got this center portion for\nradio and climate controls."},"703":{"dur":6,"text":"And you also have leather that is stitched\nleather that is right here on either side"},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"of that."},"711":{"dur":3,"text":"Just take a look at the panels that are along\nthe left and the right side of that climate"},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"control system."},"717":{"dur":3,"text":"This is the power button for your stereo."},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"CD player."},"721":{"dur":4,"text":"You actually have a disc, a place where you\nput a CD right here."},"726":{"dur":4,"text":"And this is for playing or pause the CD."},"731":{"dur":5,"text":"Tune and scroll and so what you're going to\ndo is just tune the radio station there for"},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"FM, XM."},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"The difference between radio and media."},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"Radio goes AM, FM, and XM."},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"Media is everything else."},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"USB, Ipod, Bluetooth, Auxiliary."},"749":{"dur":1,"text":"All the things like that."},"750":{"dur":4,"text":"Auto allows you to set the climate system\nat a certain temperature."},"755":{"dur":2,"text":"And it says low right here."},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"You can see its the same on the other side."},"760":{"dur":5,"text":"And so whenever you press Auto, its going\nto automatically, see auto is off right now."},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I'm going to increase the temperature\nhere."},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's set it to 72."},"772":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'm going to press Auto."},"773":{"dur":6,"text":"And right now, since Auto is on, the vehicle\nis automatically maintain the cabin temperature"},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"at 72 degrees."},"782":{"dur":1,"text":"It works just like the central air in your\nhouse."},"784":{"dur":2,"text":"This is your automatic parking brake."},"787":{"dur":5,"text":"When that light is on, that means it will\nautomatically engage and disengage the parking"},"792":{"dur":6,"text":"brake whenever you take it in and out of drive\nor park."},"799":{"dur":4,"text":"So now, with my foot on the brake and I put\nit in reverse, you see the light went out."},"804":{"dur":2,"text":"It automatically disengaged the parking brake."},"806":{"dur":5,"text":"And then I place it back it park, it engages\nit and you see the light come on."},"811":{"dur":6,"text":"And you can manually do that.So I just pushed\nit forward and the light went off and then"},"817":{"dur":3,"text":"I pulled it back and the light comes back\non."},"821":{"dur":4,"text":"So for your transmission with your shifter,\nyou have Park, Reverse, Neutral, Drive, and"},"825":{"dur":3,"text":"S. And that is manual shift."},"829":{"dur":8,"text":"So there's reverse, neutral, drive, and at\nany speed I can shift it to the left and gear"},"837":{"dur":1,"text":"up and down manually."},"838":{"dur":4,"text":"I push it forward to upshift, pull it back\nto downshift."},"843":{"dur":4,"text":"And it is an 8 speed sequential shift transmission."},"848":{"dur":3,"text":"Sequential simply meaning what I was just\ndoing, shifting it like that."},"852":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's take a look at this whole remote touch\ncontroller system."},"856":{"dur":7,"text":"And what this allows me to do is to use all\nof the functions on the navigation screen."},"863":{"dur":3,"text":"And climate, audio, navigation."},"866":{"dur":1,"text":"To change around all of my settings."},"868":{"dur":2,"text":"Basically, anything that I can want to do\nin the car."},"871":{"dur":2,"text":"I've got an enter button here on the left\nside."},"874":{"dur":3,"text":"There's also an enter button on the right\nside for the passenger."},"877":{"dur":4,"text":"If the passenger wanted to use some of these\nfunctions while you are riding down the road."},"881":{"dur":8,"text":"So, starting from the top on the left, I have\nMap, I have Up and Down, Back arrow, and Menu."},"890":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the remote touch controller itself."},"893":{"dur":6,"text":"And you can see the arm or the rest, like\nfor your wrist, is right there."},"900":{"dur":3,"text":"And that basically just allows you to put\nyour wrist on it so you can use it."},"904":{"dur":4,"text":"So I'm going to be using these buttons here\nbut I'm going to show you what pops up on"},"908":{"dur":1,"text":"the screen."},"909":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay."},"910":{"dur":2,"text":"So on the screen right now, I just pressed\nEnter."},"912":{"dur":6,"text":"And starting form the left, I have Destination,\nRadio, Media, Phone, Lexus App Suite, Info.,"},"919":{"dur":1,"text":"Climate, and Setup."},"920":{"dur":6,"text":"These are the main functions of everything\nthat I'm going to be able to do in the vehicle"},"926":{"dur":2,"text":"right from the Menu button."},"929":{"dur":3,"text":"On the far right side, I have a quick access\nmenu."},"932":{"dur":7,"text":"And that is navigation, music, phone, fuel\nsettings, climate."},"940":{"dur":1,"text":"I can change the Display."},"942":{"dur":4,"text":"And that right there indicates that there\nis no phone hooked up via bluetooth."},"946":{"dur":4,"text":"So to display, I can cut the screen off."},"950":{"dur":4,"text":"I can change the brightness and the contrast\nof the screen itself while I'm looking at"},"955":{"dur":2,"text":"it or the camera."},"957":{"dur":7,"text":"So let's go to general and I can up the brightness\nif I want to."},"964":{"dur":5,"text":"I can change the contrast."},"970":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I don't have to hit save or anything."},"973":{"dur":10,"text":"All right, so destination, this is how , obviously,\nI find a destination."},"984":{"dur":5,"text":"By address, point of interest, web search\nis in gray."},"989":{"dur":6,"text":"That's because I don't have a phone hooked\nup with the Lexus Enform App Suite so that's"},"995":{"dur":3,"text":"not going to be highlighted."},"998":{"dur":2,"text":"Destination Assist."},"1001":{"dur":2,"text":"Previous."},"1004":{"dur":3,"text":"Address book, Emergency, Intersection, Map\nand Coordinates."},"1007":{"dur":5,"text":"For the most part, you're going to use Address,\nthe ones that are one page 1 right here."},"1013":{"dur":2,"text":"You see that, these first few."},"1015":{"dur":5,"text":"So address is how I find a destination if\nI already know the address.Point of interest"},"1021":{"dur":4,"text":"is places I know the name, phone number, category\nor eDestination."},"1026":{"dur":6,"text":"Name is like Walmart, Bank of America, that\ntype of thing."},"1033":{"dur":3,"text":"Category is coffee shop, restaurant, hotel,\nbank."},"1036":{"dur":2,"text":"Phone number, its obvious what that is."},"1038":{"dur":5,"text":"And eDestination is a service that you use\non Lexusdrivers.com that allows you to input"},"1044":{"dur":5,"text":"say an itinerary of addresses and then I can\nbuild that itinerary, hit enter and send it"},"1050":{"dur":1,"text":"to the car."},"1051":{"dur":4,"text":"And then when I come out, I can hit eDestination\nand Download."},"1055":{"dur":2,"text":"And that will download my itinerary."},"1058":{"dur":2,"text":"Pretty nifty."},"1060":{"dur":2,"text":"Destination Assist is live help from Lexus."},"1063":{"dur":2,"text":"It's dedicated Lexus support."},"1065":{"dur":2,"text":"When you hit that, they'll say \"Welcome to\nDestination Assist."},"1068":{"dur":1,"text":"Where would you like to go?\""},"1069":{"dur":4,"text":"You don't have to tell them where you are,\nwho you are, or what you're driving or anything."},"1074":{"dur":3,"text":"You can actually just say, let's say we're\nin Atlanta and I want to go to an antique"},"1078":{"dur":1,"text":"store."},"1079":{"dur":3,"text":"I can hit it and actually just say, \"Find\nthe nearest antique store.\""},"1083":{"dur":3,"text":"And then they'll find it and they'll send\nit to the car and the car takes over."},"1086":{"dur":3,"text":"Obvious what that is, Previous Destinations."},"1090":{"dur":1,"text":"Presets."},"1091":{"dur":4,"text":"I can hit Go Home and I can enter my home\nnow."},"1095":{"dur":5,"text":"Now what I recommend doing, if you actually\nput your home address in there, do not put"},"1101":{"dur":2,"text":"your actual physical address."},"1103":{"dur":5,"text":"If you're address is 123 Main Street, do not\nput 123 Main Street as your home address."},"1109":{"dur":7,"text":"Put like an intersection near your house or\na store right by your house."},"1116":{"dur":3,"text":"Because if someone is actually able to steal\nyour vehicle and take your key and take your"},"1120":{"dur":3,"text":"car, they can hit go home and go right to\nyour house."},"1124":{"dur":4,"text":"You can go 1,2,3,4,5 and these are quick access\npoints."},"1128":{"dur":2,"text":"Places that you go most often."},"1130":{"dur":1,"text":"That's destination."},"1132":{"dur":2,"text":"And then you have Radio."},"1135":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's where you're going to memorize\nyour radio stations."},"1139":{"dur":5,"text":"I'm going to go to Source and then I'm going\nto hit FM."},"1144":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's make sure it doesn't blast us out of\nhere."},"1147":{"dur":6,"text":"Okay, so inside the mixed presets right here\non the radio."},"1153":{"dur":4,"text":"What that will allow me to do is to mix my\npresets and what I mean by mix, I mean mix"},"1158":{"dur":1,"text":"the sources."},"1159":{"dur":4,"text":"So I can combine AM, FM, and XM all on one\npage."},"1163":{"dur":4,"text":"And I have 6 pages of 6 presets."},"1168":{"dur":1,"text":"This is page 1."},"1169":{"dur":3,"text":"And then I can go to page 2, there's another\n6."},"1172":{"dur":1,"text":"Page 3, there's another 6."},"1173":{"dur":2,"text":"So I can go to 36 if I want to."},"1176":{"dur":8,"text":"You can see you have FM right here and so\nnow I can go to FM and listen to this radio"},"1184":{"dur":1,"text":"station if I want to."},"1185":{"dur":2,"text":"If I get tired of that, I can switch over\nto AM."},"1187":{"dur":2,"text":"If I get tired of that I can switch over to\nXM."},"1190":{"dur":5,"text":"So I can combine my different presets or I\ncan mix presets so that I don't have to jump"},"1195":{"dur":2,"text":"back and forth between sources."},"1198":{"dur":2,"text":"I can have them all right here combined."},"1200":{"dur":1,"text":"That's really what I recommend doing."},"1202":{"dur":1,"text":"That's excellent."},"1203":{"dur":7,"text":"Okay, this is the center console of the LX570\nand there are several switches that are going"},"1210":{"dur":1,"text":"on here."},"1212":{"dur":2,"text":"Starting with your heated seats."},"1214":{"dur":5,"text":"You have an automatic setting right here so\nwhenever that is on, whenever auto is on,"},"1219":{"dur":8,"text":"it's going to automatically keep the temperature\nadjusted to coordinate with the climate control"},"1227":{"dur":1,"text":"temperature in the car."},"1229":{"dur":2,"text":"And it will do it accordingly."},"1231":{"dur":7,"text":"So if its really cold and you've got the temperature\nset at like 85, that's going to really increase"},"1239":{"dur":2,"text":"the temperature of the driver's seat."},"1242":{"dur":6,"text":"And the opposite, so if its hot and you have\nthe temperature set at 65, its going to adjust"},"1248":{"dur":2,"text":"the temperature here."},"1251":{"dur":5,"text":"The fan in the ventilated seat but you can\nactually override that just by pressing one"},"1256":{"dur":1,"text":"of the two."},"1257":{"dur":4,"text":"That's the highest level, next lowest, lowest,\noff."},"1261":{"dur":2,"text":"Heated Steering wheel."},"1264":{"dur":4,"text":"And right here, this is called Turn Assist\nFunction."},"1269":{"dur":5,"text":"What this essentially does is, whenever you're\nusing Crawl Control, crawl

essentially you activate crawl control\nand the vehicle will take over."},"1287":{"dur":6,"text":"It will use sensors in the drive system, the\nall wheel drive system, and traction control"},"1293":{"dur":6,"text":"and brake assist, all those safety features\nand it will basically crawl over any nasty"},"1300":{"dur":2,"text":"rocks and things."},"1302":{"dur":4,"text":"It's an incredible system as far as off road\ncapability."},"1307":{"dur":8,"text":"Crawl, this allows you to crawl up a nasty\nhill."},"1316":{"dur":2,"text":"And also down."},"1318":{"dur":6,"text":"Traction control is here and whenever you\npress that you see track off in your tachometer."},"1324":{"dur":3,"text":"This is your locking center

transmission."},"1337":{"dur":1,"text":"That's 2nd start."},"1338":{"dur":5,"text":"So when you press that and you put it in drive,\nit changes the transmission ratios so that"},"1343":{"dur":3,"text":"whenever you start in bad weather, its going\nto reduce the likelihood of wheel slippage"},"1347":{"dur":4,"text":"because it turns the wheels more slowly."},"1351":{"dur":1,"text":"Selectable drive mode."},"1352":{"dur":5,"text":"I can turn it to comfort and I can also turn\nit again for Eco."},"1358":{"dur":3,"text":"And you see these come up on the Nav Display\nSystem."},"1362":{"dur":4,"text":"And what that's going to do is it's going\nto control the throttle mapping to make it"},"1366":{"dur":1,"text":"drive more fuel efficiently."},"1368":{"dur":4,"text":"But its also going to work with the climate\ncontrol system to make it, to make it pull"},"1372":{"dur":4,"text":"back power from the climate control system\nso that it makes it more fuel efficient."},"1377":{"dur":5,"text":"I can turn it to sport and I see sport pop\nup on there on the navigation system."},"1382":{"dur":1,"text":"That's the opposite of comfort."},"1384":{"dur":5,"text":"It changes throttle mapping to make it have\nmore torque on take off."},"1390":{"dur":3,"text":"And then I can turn it again and that's sport\nplus."},"1394":{"dur":5,"text":"And what that does is it works with the transmission\nas well and also steering to make the steering"},"1399":{"dur":1,"text":"a little tighter."},"1400":{"dur":4,"text":"And turning it over here makes it a little\nless fuel efficient but it makes it a little"},"1405":{"dur":1,"text":"more fun to drive."},"1407":{"dur":6,"text":"I can also press down and that makes it normal\nor I can press down for customize so that"},"1413":{"dur":6,"text":"I can customize the settings here so I can\nmake it like maybe a little more comfort
