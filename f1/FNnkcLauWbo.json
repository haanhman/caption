{"6":{"dur":3,"text":"I would like to tell you a bit about the work,\nsome of the work,"},"9":{"dur":5,"text":"we are trying to do, which is trying to improve\nimaging of prostate cancer,"},"15":{"dur":1,"text":"and I\u2019ll try to explain why."},"17":{"dur":5,"text":"So, I just need to tell you I have some shares\nin a company"},"22":{"dur":3,"text":"that is working out through one of the patents\nthat I did,"},"26":{"dur":6,"text":"but it is not relevant to this, but I am obliged\nto tell people, by law."},"32":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is the man\u2019s journey through prostate\ncancer."},"36":{"dur":3,"text":"I don\u2019t know if there is a mouse I could\nuse."},"40":{"dur":1,"text":"Did the arrow come up?"},"42":{"dur":3,"text":"No, never mind. I\u2019ll just explain."},"46":{"dur":3,"text":"On the left hand side you can see that diagnosis\noccurs,"},"49":{"dur":3,"text":"but probably by the stage that diagnosis occurs"},"53":{"dur":5,"text":"men have maybe had the disease for five to\nten years already."},"58":{"dur":6,"text":"And then the choices seem to be either watchful\nwaiting these days,"},"64":{"dur":5,"text":"it used to be surgery or radiation, but if\nyou have a low Gleason score,"},"70":{"dur":3,"text":"and probably all of you know what a Gleason\nscore is."},"73":{"dur":5,"text":"It\u2019s a grading of the cancer and there are\ntwo bits that they look at,"},"78":{"dur":3,"text":"they just say the bit that\u2019s the worst and\nthe bit that\u2019s, I mean sorry,"},"82":{"dur":4,"text":"the bit that\u2019s the most common has a grade\nfrom one to five"},"86":{"dur":4,"text":"and the next bit that\u2019s the next most common\nhas a grade from one to five,"},"90":{"dur":3,"text":"and they add those two numbers together to\nmake a Gleason score."},"94":{"dur":6,"text":"So, if your Gleason score is six, it\u2019s now\nconsidered to be pretty mild,"},"100":{"dur":3,"text":"and you might be advised to go on watchful\nwaiting"},"103":{"dur":1,"text":"rather than having an operation."},"105":{"dur":4,"text":"But, if it\u2019s seven or above, then usually\nthe choices are"},"110":{"dur":2,"text":"that you should do something actively about\nit,"},"112":{"dur":2,"text":"like and operation or having radiation."},"115":{"dur":4,"text":"So, most men, after that, get better."},"120":{"dur":5,"text":"But some men then, after a few years, find\nthat they have a rising PSA."},"125":{"dur":4,"text":"That\u2019s the blood test for prostate specific\nantigen."},"129":{"dur":2,"text":"And the reason that it\u2019s so useful"},"132":{"dur":2,"text":"it\u2019s now not being used so much for diagnosis,"},"135":{"dur":4,"text":"but it\u2019s incredibly useful once you know\na man has prostate cancer,"},"139":{"dur":4,"text":"because it goes up and down with the volume\nof the cancer, usually."},"143":{"dur":3,"text":"There are some cases where that does not happen,"},"147":{"dur":3,"text":"but as a general generalisation it does."},"150":{"dur":6,"text":"And so the treatment for that is some kind\nof androgen ablation,"},"156":{"dur":8,"text":"or androgen therapy, which blocks the production\nof testosterone."},"165":{"dur":2,"text":"In the olden days they used to castrate men."},"167":{"dur":2,"text":"That\u2019s not done so much now."},"169":{"dur":3,"text":"They use drugs instead to achieve that result."},"173":{"dur":7,"text":"But the reason that the PSA goes down is that\nit\u2019s actually driven by androgen,"},"181":{"dur":4,"text":"so the male hormone drives the production\nof PSA."},"185":{"dur":4,"text":"PSA is an enzyme, which is found in the ejaculate,"},"189":{"dur":5,"text":"and its role is to break down the little clot\nthat forms in the ejaculate,"},"194":{"dur":1,"text":"which is called semenogelin,"},"196":{"dur":4,"text":"so that the sperm can swim out and do what\nthey need to do."},"201":{"dur":3,"text":"So it also makes fluids in the prostate."},"204":{"dur":2,"text":"So PSA is controlled by androgen."},"207":{"dur":2,"text":"So, if you monitor the PSA levels,"},"210":{"dur":3,"text":"its giving you an idea of what\u2019s happening\nwith the androgen."},"213":{"dur":4,"text":"And it turns out that prostate cancer is very\nmuch androgen dependent"},"217":{"dur":1,"text":"and androgen driven."},"219":{"dur":7,"text":"So, initially, the Chinese eunuchs who used\nto look after the harems were all castrated,"},"226":{"dur":4,"text":"and they, none of them, ever developed prostate\ncancer."},"230":{"dur":2,"text":"So, if you didn\u2019t want to develop prostate\ncancer,"},"233":{"dur":4,"text":"you could become a nice boy soprano and sing\nup high for the rest of your life."},"237":{"dur":1,"text":"But that isn\u2019t of course what happens."},"239":{"dur":4,"text":"But it was one of the ways in which it was\nfound that the androgen was so important."},"243":{"dur":2,"text":"So, when that goes back up"},"246":{"dur":5,"text":"the androgen ablation usually brings the PSA\ndown again in many patients,"},"251":{"dur":6,"text":"but there are some who then go on to have\nanother rise in prostate cancer."},"258":{"dur":2,"text":"So by this stage, on this end of the graph,"},"260":{"dur":2,"text":"we\u2019re now talking about more advanced disease."},"263":{"dur":7,"text":"The beginning one was sort of early disease,\nbut a proportion of men get advanced disease."},"270":{"dur":6,"text":"And when we are working in research, as I\nam, you tend to concentrate on this end"},"276":{"dur":4,"text":"because the surgery and the radiation can\nwork very well for many men at the early stage."},"281":{"dur":5,"text":"So, we are trying to work out how we can save\nmen who have developed advanced stage"},"287":{"dur":0,"text":"cancer."},"288":{"dur":3,"text":"So that\u2019s why I\u2019m talking about that end\nof the spectrum."},"292":{"dur":5,"text":"So, if you\u2019re newly diagnosed I don\u2019t\nwant you to think that, you know,"},"297":{"dur":6,"text":"I\u2019m telling you, a song of doom about your\nlife expectancy, because I\u2019m not."},"303":{"dur":6,"text":"I\u2019m trying to tell you about how we might\ntreat and do things for men with late stage"},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"cancer."},"312":{"dur":4,"text":"So when that goes up, as you can see by that\nbrown line,"},"316":{"dur":5,"text":"initially the cancer is called androgen dependent\nor androgen sensitive."},"321":{"dur":3,"text":"It becomes hormone refractory, because"},"325":{"dur":5,"text":"it now does not seem to need the hormone any\nmore, or castrate resistant."},"330":{"dur":4,"text":"And at that time, or even a bit before it,\nit starts to spread"},"335":{"dur":7,"text":"and it spreads to other organs and in particular\nit goes to the bones."},"342":{"dur":3,"text":"So bony metastases, they\u2019re secondary deposits\nof cancer in the bone,"},"346":{"dur":4,"text":"are very common in late stage prostate cancer."},"350":{"dur":5,"text":"So, now what\u2019s happened."},"356":{"dur":1,"text":"Ok."},"357":{"dur":5,"text":"So this is just to explain what goes on in\nthe late stage cancer."},"363":{"dur":6,"text":"You can still treat late stage cancer, which\nnow don\u2019t seem to be hormone dependent,"},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"with some new drugs that have been discovered."},"372":{"dur":4,"text":"And what\u2019s happening is the prostate cancer\nactually makes its own androgen."},"377":{"dur":6,"text":"So after you\u2019ve taken away the androgen,\nby using androgen ablative therapies,"},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"it actually starts to make its own."},"386":{"dur":5,"text":"I\u2019ve always said the prostate\u2019s the second\nbrain, but people don\u2019t like that answer."},"392":{"dur":7,"text":"But they do, and, there are several mechanisms\nby which this can happen."},"399":{"dur":3,"text":"First of all, it uses a back door pathway,"},"403":{"dur":4,"text":"which is not the normal pathway of metabolism\nfor making the androgen,"},"407":{"dur":3,"text":"in order to make androgen in the prostate."},"411":{"dur":4,"text":"And the androgen binds to a receptor on the\ncell, which is on the surface of the cell."},"415":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean, it binds, it carries it inside of\nthe cell to the nucleus of the cell"},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"where it turns on a whole lot of genes."},"422":{"dur":5,"text":"And another mechanism of getting over the\nneed for androgen"},"428":{"dur":4,"text":"is that you get hypersensitivity of the androgen\nreceptor itself,"},"432":{"dur":3,"text":"so that it can bind other hormones as well\nas testosterone."},"436":{"dur":6,"text":"It can bind progesterone and oestrogen and\nother kinds of corticosteroids,"},"443":{"dur":4,"text":"so it does not need the androgen in order\nto perform its work."},"447":{"dur":5,"text":"Or you can get mutations in that androgen\nreceptor,"},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"or you can have multiple copies of the androgen\nreceptor."},"455":{"dur":6,"text":"So that if the level of testosterone is extremely\nlow it can still be reactive."},"461":{"dur":5,"text":"So the drugs have to be designed to work to\novercome these kinds of mechanisms"},"467":{"dur":8,"text":"that the prostate cancer produces."},"475":{"dur":3,"text":"This shows that backdoor pathway, so don\u2019t\nworry about that."},"478":{"dur":5,"text":"But if you can understand those mechanisms,\nthen you can actually design new therapies."},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"So that\u2019s what this slide is really telling\nyou."},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"That\u2019s my take home message."},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"Now I\u2019m coming back to this one again,"},"491":{"dur":7,"text":"because what happens is that we really desperately\nneed imaging to tell us"},"499":{"dur":3,"text":"\u201cDo you really have a bad prostate cancer?\u201d"},"503":{"dur":4,"text":"\u201cDo you have a cancer that isn\u2019t too bad,\neven though the Gleason score mightn\u2019t say"},"507":{"dur":4,"text":"But should we be using surveillance?"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"That means that you monitor the PSA every\nsix months"},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"and maybe do some more imaging in a year\u2019s\ntime."},"517":{"dur":4,"text":"Should you be doing that, or should you be\ngoing on to surgery or radiation?"},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"We need to be able to make those decisions\nbetter,"},"525":{"dur":4,"text":"and if we could image the cancer and clearly\nsee the cancer there,"},"529":{"dur":3,"text":"we could do that with much more precision\nand give better advice to men"},"533":{"dur":4,"text":"as to what sort of treatment might be good\nfor them."},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"And similarly, if we\u2019re using treatments,"},"539":{"dur":3,"text":"these are just new treatments that have come\nup in the last five years."},"543":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean a few years ago we did not have any\ntreatments for late stage cancer."},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"Now there\u2019s a whole series of drugs."},"550":{"dur":3,"text":"Some of them are chemotherapy, so Docetaxel\nand Cabazitaxel."},"553":{"dur":1,"text":"There is Sipuleucel-T."},"555":{"dur":5,"text":"It is an immune type of therapy that inhibits\nthe prostate cancer from growing."},"561":{"dur":5,"text":"And the Abiraterone and Enzalutamide are aimed\nat attacking the androgen receptor"},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"and the testosterone."},"568":{"dur":6,"text":"And the 223 Radium is a radioactive substance,"},"575":{"dur":4,"text":"which also delivers a sort of high level of\nradiotherapy locally."},"579":{"dur":5,"text":"So, we need it to know, not only for diagnosing,\nbut for treating."},"584":{"dur":4,"text":"A lot of these treatments work in some men\nand not other men."},"588":{"dur":5,"text":"And they have quite nasty side effects in\nsome men and not other men."},"594":{"dur":6,"text":"So if you\u2019re unfortunate and have a bad\nresponse and get very sick with having, say,"},"600":{"dur":5,"text":"Docetaxel, we need to know is it working so\nthat we can stop it a bit sooner,"},"605":{"dur":5,"text":"or should we keep going and putting people\nthrough these nasty side effects"},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"who aren\u2019t going to respond."},"612":{"dur":5,"text":"But if we could image the cancer well we could\ntell a bit earlier whether that\u2019s working,"},"618":{"dur":4,"text":"and that would help with the management of\nthe disease."},"622":{"dur":5,"text":"So, I\u2019ve just put up here - and I don\u2019t\nexpect you to read it \u2013"},"627":{"dur":5,"text":"it\u2019s a great pile of clinical trials that\nare going with all these new drugs."},"632":{"dur":5,"text":"So it\u2019s just to show you that and awful\nlot is now happening world-wide with all these"},"638":{"dur":1,"text":"drugs."},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"And clinical trials are usually randomised,"},"641":{"dur":5,"text":"so a patient will be given one treatment or\nnot a treatment,"},"646":{"dur":3,"text":"so that you can actually compare what would\nhappen to them over time."},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"And if the clinical trials aren\u2019t done in\nthat manner,"},"652":{"dur":4,"text":"then you can\u2019t really draw appropriate conclusions\nabout how good the treatment is."},"657":{"dur":4,"text":"But this is just to show you there\u2019s all\nthese trials and, in addition,"},"662":{"dur":4,"text":"whilst I showed you a whole series of drugs\nthat were there,"},"666":{"dur":3,"text":"we don\u2019t know if we should combine the drugs."},"669":{"dur":4,"text":"And if we should combine the drugs, or treat\nwith one then another,"},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"what order should we give those drugs in."},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"Because sometimes if you combine them they\u2019re\nbetter,"},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"sometimes if you combine them it make it worse."},"682":{"dur":3,"text":"And sometimes if you give one first you can\u2019t\nuse another one."},"686":{"dur":4,"text":"And those kinds of decisions are quite difficult\nto make."},"690":{"dur":4,"text":"So that very much is what is going on in that\nspace at the moment."},"695":{"dur":4,"text":"And one of the things that happens when you\nuse some of the new drugs"},"699":{"dur":4,"text":"is that the androgen receptor, which is very\ncomplicated molecule,"},"704":{"dur":3,"text":"and up the top is the normal androgen receptor."},"708":{"dur":5,"text":"It\u2019s got different domains and the one on\nthe right, which is sticking out called LBD,"},"713":{"dur":3,"text":"is called the ligand binding domain."},"717":{"dur":3,"text":"But what happens when you treat with these\nbrand new drugs,"},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"which are very powerful inhibitors of androgen,"},"723":{"dur":4,"text":"is that you select for a variant of the androgen\nreceptor,"},"728":{"dur":6,"text":"which maybe present already, and it has no\nligand binding domain."},"735":{"dur":5,"text":"So it actually works very strongly whether\nthe androgen is there or not there."},"741":{"dur":3,"text":"So you\u2019re not achieving the result that\nyou want."},"744":{"dur":4,"text":"And some of the new findings are that this\nparticular variant,"},"748":{"dur":9,"text":"which is AR-V7 is actually coming up after\nthese therapies."},"757":{"dur":5,"text":"And when you give those treatments, and if\nthe patient has AR-V7,"},"763":{"dur":6,"text":"you can see on the slide on the left the response\nof the people to drugs."},"770":{"dur":3,"text":"So, the black line is your sort of zero line"},"773":{"dur":4,"text":"and the yellow ones have got that variant\nand they\u2019re not responding."},"777":{"dur":3,"text":"The ones that are blue are responding, so\nthey\u2019re actually getting better."},"781":{"dur":5,"text":"So, this is a new problem which has just recently\ncome to people\u2019s notice"},"787":{"dur":3,"text":"after these very new drugs have been developed."},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"So still haven\u2019t really got a cure."},"792":{"dur":5,"text":"We can prolong lives and make people sort\nof have a chronic disease."},"798":{"dur":1,"text":"This is for advanced stage cancer."},"799":{"dur":4,"text":"So let me stress that, because if it is early\nstage cancer,"},"803":{"dur":3,"text":"some people respond beautifully to prostatectomy\nor radiation"},"807":{"dur":1,"text":"and there isn\u2019t another problem."},"808":{"dur":6,"text":"So I\u2019m talking about the advanced disease,\nwhich we are trying to concentrate on."},"814":{"dur":7,"text":"So, let\u2019s talk about how we work out what\nto do."},"821":{"dur":7,"text":"Most patients I stratified into risk strategies,\nrisk categories using clinical staging,"},"829":{"dur":4,"text":"which is based on how bad your cancer is."},"833":{"dur":2,"text":"How sick you are: things like that;"},"836":{"dur":5,"text":"the level of prostate cancer antigen in the\nblood and the biopsy grading."},"842":{"dur":4,"text":"If they\u2019re under-staged, and the treatment\nis given,"},"847":{"dur":2,"text":"then that can lead to an earlier recurrence."},"850":{"dur":5,"text":"We call it a biochemical recurrence because\nthe PSA comes back up"},"855":{"dur":1,"text":"and that\u2019s a biochemical molecule."},"857":{"dur":1,"text":"Whereas if they are over-staged,"},"859":{"dur":4,"text":"they might be treated more aggressively than\nthey need to be treated."},"863":{"dur":3,"text":"So we need something to tell us what\u2019s going\non."},"866":{"dur":4,"text":"And we need either diagnostic tests or, perhaps\nwhat I have not mentioned"},"871":{"dur":5,"text":"is that whilst a lot of men get prostate cancer,\nand as you get older,"},"877":{"dur":2,"text":"you are more likely to get it."},"879":{"dur":4,"text":"So by the time people are eighty, eighty percent\nof men have prostate cancer,"},"883":{"dur":3,"text":"But it might not be a very aggressive disease."},"887":{"dur":4,"text":"And we still don\u2019t have a marker which tells\nus this disease"},"891":{"dur":5,"text":"is only going to cause changes that aren\u2019t\nreally going to affect the man\u2019s life"},"896":{"dur":2,"text":"and this disease is going to be really aggressive."},"899":{"dur":1,"text":"We don\u2019t have those biomarkers yet."},"901":{"dur":6,"text":"We\u2019re searching for them desperately, but\nwe don\u2019t have those biomarkers."},"907":{"dur":1,"text":"So what about imaging?"},"909":{"dur":8,"text":"Well, when men go to have a biopsy done, it\u2019s\nactually changing now but this was the norm."},"917":{"dur":6,"text":"They might have a transrectal ultrasound guided\nprostate biopsy."},"924":{"dur":3,"text":"That means a probe is put in through the rectum"},"927":{"dur":4,"text":"and it goes to specific areas which are predefined\nin the prostate"},"931":{"dur":6,"text":"and takes little pieces so the histology can\nbe done and something can be done about it."},"938":{"dur":6,"text":"But if you then do a radical prostatectomy\non men who have had those"},"945":{"dur":2,"text":"and do what is called a whole mount,"},"947":{"dur":2,"text":"which means that you cut through the whole\nprostate"},"949":{"dur":1,"text":"and you go through every section of the prostate."},"951":{"dur":3,"text":"It\u2019s a huge amount of work for the pathologist\nto do that."},"955":{"dur":6,"text":"They often find that staging that came from\nthose pre-organised biopsies is incorrect."},"961":{"dur":5,"text":"It might be under-staged or it might be over-staged."},"967":{"dur":4,"text":"And the other problem is that if your biopsy\nis taken through the rectum"},"971":{"dur":8,"text":"and the cancer is on the other side of the\nprostate it\u2019s not part of what\u2019s biopsied."},"980":{"dur":2,"text":"So, you can miss out on it."},"983":{"dur":3,"text":"So we need some other ways of doing it."},"986":{"dur":4,"text":"And also within the prostate, this is true\nfor most cancers,"},"991":{"dur":6,"text":"but it\u2019s especially so for the prostate,\nyou can have multiple foci of cancers."},"997":{"dur":3,"text":"So, there might be one at the top and one\nnext to it and down here."},"1001":{"dur":0,"text":"And they are all different."},"1002":{"dur":2,"text":"They are not the same."},"1004":{"dur":4,"text":"And when they spread from the prostate to\nother tissues"},"1009":{"dur":4,"text":"they can actually spread, say, from the prostate\nto a lymph node or to the bone,"},"1013":{"dur":2,"text":"where they form the bone metastases."},"1016":{"dur":1,"text":"And then they can spread again."},"1017":{"dur":2,"text":"And instead of spreading from the prostate"},"1020":{"dur":3,"text":"they can actually spread from the one that\u2019s\nin the bone to somewhere else."},"1023":{"dur":4,"text":"Or they can spread from one that\u2019s in the\nlymph node to somewhere else."},"1028":{"dur":5,"text":"So, it\u2019s an incredibly complicated disease\nto try and study"},"1034":{"dur":5,"text":"and find new methods to look after."},"1039":{"dur":9,"text":"So, for lymph node detection, they\u2019ve been\nusing MRI, magnetic resonance imaging."},"1048":{"dur":1,"text":"Has anyone had an MRI here?"},"1050":{"dur":3,"text":"Yes. So you know what it is."},"1053":{"dur":3,"text":"And they\u2019re now using special types of MRI,"},"1057":{"dur":5,"text":"where they look at function as well as looking\nat the actual tumour."},"1062":{"dur":2,"text":"And what had been said before was that"},"1065":{"dur":3,"text":"even when you use some of the functional imaging,\nwhich I\u2019ve mentioned there,"},"1069":{"dur":1,"text":"diffuse-weighted imaging,"},"1070":{"dur":5,"text":"you can\u2019t detect a lymph node involvement\nunless it is bigger than eight millimetres."},"1076":{"dur":5,"text":"Eight millimetres is pretty tiny, but if it\nis smaller than that you can\u2019t see it."},"1081":{"dur":4,"text":"So you actually need to use nanoparticles\nto enhance the MRI"},"1085":{"dur":3,"text":"in order to see that by special techniques."},"1089":{"dur":3,"text":"So I\u2019ll tell you a bit more about those."},"1092":{"dur":9,"text":"So, even with the special MRI, and they\u2019ve\nnow got a new system for grading the MRI,"},"1102":{"dur":7,"text":"called PIRAD, which is the I forget what it\u2019s\ncalled, the predictive value."},"1109":{"dur":5,"text":"You are still missing out on some of the tumours."},"1115":{"dur":4,"text":"So in the PA Hospital we\u2019ve now got a new\ninstrument which is the PET MRI,"},"1119":{"dur":3,"text":"so we can do positive emissions tomography\nat the same time."},"1123":{"dur":3,"text":"And I\u2019ll tell you a bit about that too."},"1126":{"dur":8,"text":"So, just to reiterate, prostate cancer is\ncurrently imaged by transrectal ultrasound,"},"1135":{"dur":5,"text":"magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography\nwhich is another form of imaging,"},"1141":{"dur":2,"text":"and positron emission tomography."},"1143":{"dur":3,"text":"But we are still not getting our answers."},"1146":{"dur":4,"text":"We need better tools, both to diagnose and\nassist the response."},"1151":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we set about to develop new methods"},"1154":{"dur":4,"text":"to improve the imaging in the lab using models."},"1159":{"dur":7,"text":"Not men but mouse models or human cancers\ngrowing in mice that are immunodeficient."},"1166":{"dur":5,"text":"We can actually take biopsies from men and\nput them into mice"},"1171":{"dur":3,"text":"and if they have not got a proper immune response\nthey will grow up"},"1175":{"dur":1,"text":"and we can see what is going on."},"1176":{"dur":3,"text":"That is how the work\u2019s done."},"1180":{"dur":4,"text":"So we started off using iron oxide nanoparticles"},"1184":{"dur":2,"text":"and we\u2019ve also used hyperbranched polymers."},"1186":{"dur":3,"text":"So I\u2019ll just explain those."},"1190":{"dur":7,"text":"So we found that there is an antigen that\nis a marker, a biomarker,"},"1198":{"dur":2,"text":"expressed on the surface of prostate cancer\ncells."},"1201":{"dur":3,"text":"It\u2019s call prostate specific membrane antigen."},"1204":{"dur":4,"text":"It was discovered a long time ago by one of\nmy colleagues,"},"1208":{"dur":2,"text":"who was at Sloan Kettering Memorial then,"},"1211":{"dur":3,"text":"and now in New York and is now at Cleveland\nClinic."},"1215":{"dur":4,"text":"And it\u2019s found on the outside of the cells."},"1219":{"dur":5,"text":"So they made antibodies to it so that they\ncan actually detect it."},"1225":{"dur":6,"text":"And in the normal epithelial of the prostate,\nthe normal prostate, it\u2019s inside the cell."},"1232":{"dur":4,"text":"And in prostate cancer it changes and goes\nand sits on the outside of the cell,"},"1236":{"dur":3,"text":"which

interesting about it is that,"},"1262":{"dur":4,"text":"when an antibody or something binds to the\nPSMA on the surface of the cell,"},"1266":{"dur":6,"text":"it\u2019s got a motif in the sequence of the\namino acids that make up the antigen,"},"1273":{"dur":2,"text":"which carry it inside the cell."},"1275":{"dur":6,"text":"So that means that, if we can put something\nonto a molecule that\u2019s going to bind to"},"1282":{"dur":0,"text":"PSMA,"},"1283":{"dur":1,"text":"we can carry it inside the cell."},"1284":{"dur":6,"text":"And our idea is to put a drug onto the PSMA\ntargeted nanoparticles"},"1291":{"dur":7,"text":"so that we can get a higher dose of treatment\ninside the prostate cancer cells,"},"1298":{"dur":6,"text":"whilst avoiding take-up of drug in other tissues\nso that you knock out the side effects"},"1305":{"dur":3,"text":"and increase the treatment where you need\nthe treatment."},"1309":{"dur":5,"text":"And if you\u2019ve got a marker such as PSMA,\nand it\u2019s found on the bone metastases"},"1315":{"dur":3,"text":"as well as on the lymph nodes as well as in\nthe prostate,"},"1318":{"dur":5,"text":"and you put it into the blood, it should go\nand find those cancers,"},"1323":{"dur":5,"text":"and then it can knock out those cancers as\nwell, or image them."},"1329":{"dur":6,"text":"So it used to be used as a test called ProstaScint for\nfinding prostate cancer."},"1335":{"dur":2,"text":"But, unfortunately, they used and antibody"},"1338":{"dur":4,"text":"which was not made against the part that was\noutside the cells"},"1343":{"dur":1,"text":"but the part that was inside the cells."},"1344":{"dur":1,"text":"So it did not work very well."},"1346":{"dur":5,"text":"But they have now found that more molecules\nthat bind to PSMA"},"1352":{"dur":3,"text":"can be used for PET imaging."},"1355":{"dur":4,"text":"What we did was we used iron oxide nanoparticles"},"1360":{"dur":7,"text":"because when you use iron in MRI it goes darker,"},"1367":{"dur":4,"text":"so it enhances the image that you can get\nwith normal MRI."},"1372":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I\u2019ve shown that here."},"1376":{"dur":6,"text":"We made a particle like this with lots of\narms on it"},"1383":{"dur":4,"text":"and we attached an antibody against PSMA or\nJ591"},"1388":{"dur":4,"text":"which binds to the outside of the PSMA on\nthe cell."},"1392":{"dur":2,"text":"And when you inject that into a mouse,"},"1395":{"dur":4,"text":"and just actually inject it into the mouse\nprostate to see what would happen,"},"1399":{"dur":2,"text":"because we were not really sure what we were\nlooking for,"},"1401":{"dur":7,"text":"you could see you get this terrific darkening\neffect by the nanoparticles that are targeted."},"1409":{"dur":4,"text":"Then we found that they were nontoxic to prostate\ncancer cells"},"1413":{"dur":3,"text":"so we grew the cells and they didn\u2019t die\nin the presence of those."},"1417":{"dur":6,"text":"So that\u2019s important if you are going to\nstart putting them into a patient."},"1423":{"dur":5,"text":"And we also showed that they were taken up\nby the cells"},"1428":{"dur":4,"text":"so these show fluorescent binding so we put\na fluorescent marker on nanoparticles"},"1433":{"dur":7,"text":"and you can see that it\u2019s gone into the\nprostate cancer cells there at the bottom."},"1441":{"dur":4,"text":"And here we\u2019ve got, because the nanoparticles\nare made of iron,"},"1446":{"dur":3,"text":"there is a stain that picks up iron and so\nyou can see here that,"},"1449":{"dur":4,"text":"in the presence of the antibody they\u2019re\ntaken up much better"},"1453":{"dur":3,"text":"than when they are by themselves without the\nantibody."},"1457":{"dur":8,"text":"And you get a lot of blue staining inside\nthe tissue."},"1466":{"dur":3,"text":"So then we did an experiment where we had\nmice"},"1469":{"dur":2,"text":"that were injected with prostate cancer cells,"},"1472":{"dur":4,"text":"and the prostate cancer was actually injected\ninto the prostate of the mice,"},"1477":{"dur":4,"text":"which is quite a tricky operation because\nit is very small."},"1481":{"dur":5,"text":"And then we either injected the mice that\nwere carrying the tumours"},"1487":{"dur":2,"text":"with nanoparticles alone or targeted nanoparticles."},"1490":{"dur":5,"text":"So the nanoparticles alone are on the left\nand the targeted ones are on the right."},"1495":{"dur":3,"text":"And we looked after two hours and after twenty-four\nhours with MRI"},"1499":{"dur":2,"text":"and you can see that blackening effect that\nwe\u2019re getting;"},"1501":{"dur":3,"text":"see the red arrow on the right, and similarly\nat twenty four hours."},"1505":{"dur":2,"text":"So that was highly successful"},"1507":{"dur":7,"text":"and showed that we could increase the ability\nto see the tumour in this way."},"1515":{"dur":3,"text":"And you can see as I mentioned the blue stain\nbefore."},"1519":{"dur":3,"text":"Up at the top is the tumour grown in the mice,"},"1522":{"dur":4,"text":"and with nanoparticles alone you got a little\nbit of uptake,"},"1526":{"dur":5,"text":"but when you had the nanoparticles with the\nantibody you got a lot of uptake."},"1531":{"dur":3,"text":"And it did go a little bit to the spleen and\nthe liver, but really not very much."},"1535":{"dur":2,"text":"So we were not getting very much uptake in\nother organs."},"1538":{"dur":6,"text":"We were only getting it in the prostate tissue\noff that cancer tissue."},"1544":{"dur":6,"text":"So from that we decided that the nanoparticles\nwere safe in the normal prostate."},"1551":{"dur":2,"text":"And when we labelled them with the antibodies"},"1553":{"dur":4,"text":"we get much better uptake by cancer cells\nand that enhances the MRI."},"1558":{"dur":5,"text":"And so they have the potential to be used\nas an imaging tool in patients."},"1564":{"dur":6,"text":"Now some people have used nanoparticles before\nin patients that are made of iron"},"1570":{"dur":4,"text":"and unfortunately it caused some pain and\na few toxic effects in patients."},"1575":{"dur":5,"text":"So we did all this work, but now it hasn\u2019t\nmoved into the clinic,"},"1580":{"dur":2,"text":"because there could be some problems."},"1583":{"dur":4,"text":"So we are trying to develop some other methods."},"1587":{"dur":4,"text":"So the next thing was we\u2019ve used this hyperbranched\npolymers."},"1591":{"dur":2,"text":"And they\u2019re a type of nanoparticle."},"1594":{"dur":4,"text":"Because they\u2019re hyperbranched you can stick\nthings on the branches."},"1598":{"dur":4,"text":"So if you think of an octopus with all these\narms everywhere,"},"1603":{"dur":1,"text":"we can put a targeting agent on it."},"1605":{"dur":1,"text":"We can put an imaging agent on."},"1607":{"dur":3,"text":"We can put a drug on that gets delivered and\nso on."},"1610":{"dur":3,"text":"So that was our idea, and that\u2019s just to\nshow."},"1614":{"dur":6,"text":"And we tried both a peptide that was made\nfrom an antibody,"},"1620":{"dur":2,"text":"which is a smaller molecule than an antibody."},"1623":{"dur":3,"text":"We tried the antibody and we tried a very\nsmall molecule."},"1626":{"dur":3,"text":"Or we tried the hyperbranched polymers with\nnothing attached,"},"1630":{"dur":4,"text":"and put them into mice in the same way with\ntumours."},"1634":{"dur":2,"text":"So we wanted to compare the efficacy of the\nthree"},"1637":{"dur":5,"text":"Audience question"},"1642":{"dur":6,"text":"When you say PSMA minus, do some prostate\ncancer cells not have PSMA?"},"1648":{"dur":1,"text":"Professor Russell"},"1650":{"dur":3,"text":"In the body all prostate cancer cells have\nPSMA."},"1654":{"dur":5,"text":"In the laboratory we disable PSMA on some\nprostate cancer cells. We call these PSMA"},"1660":{"dur":5,"text":"Pause the video here to read more."},"1666":{"dur":5,"text":"and we did some imaging studies after we\u2019d\ndone the in vitro work"},"1671":{"dur":5,"text":"to show we chose the best one for in vivo\nstudies."},"1677":{"dur":4,"text":"So we could show here by what\u2019s called flow\ncytometry"},"1682":{"dur":5,"text":"that we had cells that express PSMA and cells\nthat did not express PSMA,"},"1687":{"dur":2,"text":"which were a control one for the other."},"1690":{"dur":3,"text":"And you can see the red ones are the ones\nthat express PSMA"},"1693":{"dur":3,"text":"and the black ones are the ones that don\u2019t."},"1697":{"dur":2,"text":"And when we treated cells in tissue culture"},"1699":{"dur":4,"text":"we got much more staining of the ones that\nwere PSMA positive"},"1703":{"dur":4,"text":"as you can see it each time and at each dose."},"1707":{"dur":4,"text":"And, for example, at 120 minutes"},"1712":{"dur":4,"text":"we were getting terrific uptake of the hyperbranched\npolymer with the peptide"},"1717":{"dur":6,"text":"compared with what\u2019s being taken up in the\ncells that don\u2019t express the PSMA ligand."},"1724":{"dur":7,"text":"And similarly, with the antibody, so we got\nthat working with both."},"1731":{"dur":3,"text":"And we could show again, using confocal microscopy,"},"1735":{"dur":3,"text":"that we were getting uptake of the nanoparticles,"},"1738":{"dur":2,"text":"which were labelled with the green fluorescence\nmarker."},"1741":{"dur":9,"text":"You can see there the very strong green fluorescence\nwith those two molecules there."},"1751":{"dur":1,"text":"So then we did a mouse experiment,"},"1753":{"dur":4,"text":"and in this time we had the tumours labelled\nwith a red fluorescence marker"},"1757":{"dur":4,"text":"so we could see them with special imaging\nequipment."},"1762":{"dur":4,"text":"And we put the ones that had PSMA positive\non one side"},"1767":{"dur":3,"text":"and the ones with PSMA negative on the other\nside."},"1771":{"dur":5,"text":"And you can see when we injected our theranostic\nhyperbranched polymer"},"1776":{"dur":3,"text":"with the peptide attached that binds to PSMA,"},"1779":{"dur":5,"text":"we got really good imaging of the ones on\nthe right, which were PSMA positive,"},"1785":{"dur":2,"text":"and there wasn\u2019t any imaging of the ones\non the left."},"1787":{"dur":2,"text":"So now we\u2019re not looking at red, we\u2019re\nlooking at green fluorescence."},"1790":{"dur":5,"text":"But you can see in the red circle there that\nyou are getting very good uptake,"},"1796":{"dur":4,"text":"so that means that its got imaging potential."},"1800":{"dur":5,"text":"And in addition, after we\u2019d done the imaging,\nwe euthanized the mice"},"1806":{"dur":2,"text":"and we took out the various organs"},"1808":{"dur":4,"text":"and looked to see how much fluorescence we\nwere getting in any other organs."},"1812":{"dur":8,"text":"You can see here this is PSMA positive tumour\nand the PSMA negative tumour"},"1821":{"dur":5,"text":"So it was quite specific for prostate cancer."},"1826":{"dur":4,"text":"And then we used a small molecule and did\nthe same thing."},"1831":{"dur":6,"text":"But instead of doing fluorescence imaging\nwe\u2019ve done imaging using PET."},"1838":{"dur":3,"text":"So in this case you have to use a radio-active\nisotope,"},"1841":{"dur":4,"text":"which is a attached to what\u2019s binding to\nthe PSMA."},"1845":{"dur":5,"text":"And you can see on the bottom we haven\u2019t\ngot any staining of the tumour,"},"1851":{"dur":2,"text":"whereas up the top we have very good staining."},"1853":{"dur":6,"text":"Now we use copper 64, but they don\u2019t use\nthat so much in the clinic, but they can,"},"1860":{"dur":7,"text":"and we just did not have the right apparatus\nto make the other radio isotopes."},"1867":{"dur":2,"text":"But they are now doing it in the clinic."},"1870":{"dur":0,"text":"I\u2019d like to show you."},"1871":{"dur":5,"text":"So, just before I move on to that, you can\nsee from those data"},"1876":{"dur":6,"text":"that we were getting good binding both in\ntissue culture, that\u2019s in vitro and in vivo,"},"1882":{"dur":7,"text":"where we can image the tumours better with\nthese PSMA targeted molecules."},"1890":{"dur":5,"text":"So now we\u2019re ready, we\u2019ve added the drug\non."},"1896":{"dur":4,"text":"It\u2019s taken 18 months of chemistry to be\nable to add the drug on to those"},"1900":{"dur":1,"text":"and we\u2019re ready to test them."},"1902":{"dur":1,"text":"So the chemists have been working,"},"1904":{"dur":3,"text":"my colleagues have been working very hard\nto get them on."},"1907":{"dur":4,"text":"But before that, what they\u2019ve done is, instead\nof using Docetaxel,"},"1912":{"dur":10,"text":"they used just a trial drug which is bound\nto the polymers with hydrazone linkage,"},"1923":{"dur":3,"text":"which comes off when you change the Ph."},"1926":{"dur":1,"text":"That\u2019s the acidity."},"1928":{"dur":3,"text":"And when it goes inside the cell and goes\nto the lysosome"},"1932":{"dur":7,"text":"the Ph drops down to five or six instead of\nbeing at seven."},"1939":{"dur":12,"text":"And so we can show that at Ph 5 the polymer\nremains intact,"},"1952":{"dur":6,"text":"sorry at Ph 7 the polymer remains intact,\nbut when we drop the Ph to 5,"},"1958":{"dur":1,"text":"we actually get it released."},"1960":{"dur":2,"text":"So that would happen inside the cell."},"1962":{"dur":2,"text":"So we\u2019ve now attached the Docetaxel"},"1964":{"dur":3,"text":"and we\u2019re waiting to do those experiments\nstraight after Christmas."},"1967":{"dur":2,"text":"So we hope that it works."},"1970":{"dur":6,"text":"Now the other thing I wanted to tell you is\nthat there is a model of prostate cancer."},"1977":{"dur":8,"text":"The only animal, only mammal, which gets prostate\ncancer apart from man is the dog."},"1986":{"dur":2,"text":"So mice don\u2019t get prostate

dogs"},"2007":{"dur":6,"text":"is that the cancers that form in the bone\nare osteoblastic so they are making more bone,"},"2013":{"dur":2,"text":"which is what happens in prostate
