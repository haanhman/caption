live in a world where children are routinely\nconfronted with extreme sources of stress"},"265":{"dur":6,"text":"and adversity, ranging from displaced children\nin Syria fleeing war to children affected"},"272":{"dur":5,"text":"by the growing famine in Somalia to children\nright here in the United States, millions"},"277":{"dur":2,"text":"of whom are living in poverty."},"279":{"dur":4,"text":"And today, what we're going to talk about\nis how those experiences of stress and adversity"},"284":{"dur":4,"text":"impact children's development-- particularly\nhow they impact the way the brain develops--"},"288":{"dur":5,"text":"and ultimately impacts children's chances\nfor success in life."},"293":{"dur":4,"text":"So I want to start by giving a few examples\nof the kinds of children that we work with"},"298":{"dur":1,"text":"in my lab here at UW."},"300":{"dur":2,"text":"So I want you to imagine Michael."},"303":{"dur":3,"text":"Michael is living with a father who has a\ndrinking problem."},"307":{"dur":4,"text":"When he's drinking, he often experiences rage\nthat's unpredictable."},"311":{"dur":4,"text":"And in these episodes, he will hit Michael\nand the other children in the family, as well"},"316":{"dur":1,"text":"as Michael's mother."},"317":{"dur":4,"text":"So Michael's living in an environment that's\ncharacterized by unpredictable and uncontrollable"},"322":{"dur":1,"text":"threat."},"323":{"dur":6,"text":"Now, in contrast, imagine Sarah, who is being\nraised in an environment that's relatively"},"330":{"dur":5,"text":"safe, but that's lacking in cognitive stimulation,\ncomplexity, and interaction with adults."},"335":{"dur":5,"text":"So Sarah's family lives in poverty, and because\nher mother has to work multiple jobs to support"},"340":{"dur":5,"text":"the family, she's often cared for by older\nsiblings or teenagers in her neighborhood."},"346":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, the experiences of Michael and Sarah\nmight appear to be atypical."},"352":{"dur":4,"text":"But our work has actually shown that they\nare remarkably common among children living"},"356":{"dur":1,"text":"in this country."},"357":{"dur":5,"text":"So what you can see on this graph are data\nfrom a nationally representative sample of"},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"over 10,000 children in this country."},"365":{"dur":6,"text":"And what the numbers are showing are the prevalence\nrates of exposure to different types of environmental"},"371":{"dur":5,"text":"adversity, ranging from things like losing\na parent or having your parents get divorced,"},"377":{"dur":5,"text":"being raised in a family where your parents\nhave a substance use problem or there's domestic"},"382":{"dur":5,"text":"violence, to more serious indicators of maltreatment,\nlike abuse, neglect, or living in chronic"},"388":{"dur":1,"text":"poverty."},"389":{"dur":4,"text":"And although the prevalence of each of these\nindividual experiences varies, what we've"},"394":{"dur":4,"text":"found is remarkable, which is that more than\nhalf of all children in this country will"},"398":{"dur":3,"text":"experience at least one of these events by\nthe time they reach adulthood."},"401":{"dur":3,"text":"And obviously, these statistics are not confined\nto the United States."},"405":{"dur":4,"text":"We know that currently, about 250 million\nchildren are living in countries that are"},"410":{"dur":6,"text":"affected by war, and about half of the entire\nworld's population who lives in extreme poverty"},"416":{"dur":1,"text":"are children."},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"So these problems exist around the world,\nnot just in the United States."},"421":{"dur":5,"text":"And this is concerning, because we know that\nexposure to these kinds of experiences is"},"426":{"dur":3,"text":"a powerful predictor of your mental health\nlater in life."},"430":{"dur":4,"text":"So what you can see on this graph are the\nnumber of those adverse experiences a child"},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"had in that large nationally representative\nsample."},"437":{"dur":4,"text":"And here it's showing you the odds that they\nwent on to develop a mental health problem,"},"442":{"dur":5,"text":"like anxiety, depression, or substance use,\ncompared to children who had never experienced"},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"that adversity."},"448":{"dur":3,"text":"And you see this very strong relationship\nbetween the number of adverse experiences"},"452":{"dur":4,"text":"a child had and the likelihood that they went\non to develop a serious mental health problem,"},"457":{"dur":5,"text":"with children here at the highest levels of\nexposure being almost five times as likely"},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"to develop a mental health problem by the\ntime they reach adulthood as children who"},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"have never had these kinds of experiences."},"469":{"dur":4,"text":"And we know that these effects are not confined\nto childhood, but that they persist throughout"},"474":{"dur":1,"text":"the rest of the life course."},"476":{"dur":6,"text":"Here, what you're seeing is something that's\ndescribing the proportion of all mental disorders"},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"that start in the United States."},"485":{"dur":4,"text":"What proportion of those are explained by\nexposure to those adverse experiences I showed"},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"you just two slides ago?"},"491":{"dur":4,"text":"And another way of thinking about these numbers\nis, it's the proportion of mental health problems"},"495":{"dur":4,"text":"that we could theoretically prevent if we\ngot rid of adversity, or were able to prevent"},"500":{"dur":1,"text":"the downstream consequences of it."},"502":{"dur":4,"text":"And what you see is that almost half of all\nmental health problems that start in children"},"507":{"dur":5,"text":"in this country are attributable to exposure\nto stress and adversity-- about 1\/3 of mental"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"health problems that begin during adolescence."},"514":{"dur":4,"text":"But strikingly, we find that about one in\nfour mental health problems that start in"},"519":{"dur":7,"text":"adulthood here in the United States are explained\nby exposure to stress and adversity in childhood."},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"So what explains these associations?"},"529":{"dur":4,"text":"Why is exposure to stress and adversity such\na powerful predictor of psychopathology?"},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"And what are the mechanisms that explain that?"},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"So what's going on, developmentally?"},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is really the primary research question\nthat we study in my lab here at the University"},"544":{"dur":1,"text":"of Washington."},"545":{"dur":5,"text":"And specifically, we're interested in understanding\nhow experiences of adversity influence the"},"551":{"dur":4,"text":"developing brain in ways that may ultimately\nplace children at risk for developing mental"},"555":{"dur":3,"text":"health problems later in life."},"558":{"dur":4,"text":"So to study this question, we rely on a tool\ncalled MRI."},"563":{"dur":1,"text":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging."},"565":{"dur":5,"text":"Which essentially uses powerful magnets to\nmeasure different aspects of brain structure"},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"and brain function."},"572":{"dur":6,"text":"And so I'm going to show you a lot of data\nfrom something called Functional MRI, where,"},"578":{"dur":5,"text":"essentially, we use this magnet to try to\nmeasure the amount of blood flow in the brain."},"584":{"dur":5,"text":"And the idea is that when a particular region\nof your brain is active, the neurons start"},"589":{"dur":4,"text":"firing more, and blood flow to that region\nof the brain increases."},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"And the MRI can measure that signal."},"596":{"dur":4,"text":"Changes in blood flow that we think represent\nchanges in how many neurons are firing in"},"600":{"dur":1,"text":"different parts of your brain."},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"So you're probably familiar with these colorful\nmaps of the brain."},"606":{"dur":3,"text":"FMRI, or Functional MRI, is what produces\nthese colorful maps."},"610":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'm going to explain a little bit about\nwhat these maps are actually showing."},"613":{"dur":3,"text":"So, for example, this is a study that was\nconducted by a grad student in my lab, named"},"617":{"dur":1,"text":"Matt Peverill."},"618":{"dur":4,"text":"And this was a fairly simple study, where\nchildren were asked to look at an image that"},"623":{"dur":4,"text":"might have looked something like this, and\nto remember where the stars were located in"},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"this array."},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"Sometimes there were two stars, and sometimes\nthere were four stars."},"632":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, when we analyze the data, it produces\nthis colorful map here."},"636":{"dur":3,"text":"And what you're seeing here is the comparison\nof when children were trying to remember the"},"640":{"dur":3,"text":"location of four stars relative to two stars."},"644":{"dur":4,"text":"And so the way that we interpret this are,\nthe regions that you see colored here are"},"648":{"dur":3,"text":"regions of the brain that are active when\nwe're trying to remember something."},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"When we're trying to remember it over a short\nperiod of time."},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"Something that we call \"working memory.\""},"657":{"dur":4,"text":"These were regions that were more active when\nyou have to hold more things in mind."},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'm going to show you a bunch of maps throughout\nthis talk that looked like this."},"665":{"dur":4,"text":"And you can interpret them as meaning regions\nthe rain that were more active when kids were"},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"doing a particular kind of mental process."},"672":{"dur":4,"text":"But the kinds of maps I'm going to show you\nwere designed to examine how experiences of"},"676":{"dur":3,"text":"adversity influence brain development in children."},"680":{"dur":4,"text":"And so what I'm going to do for the rest of\nthe talk is walk through some of the work"},"684":{"dur":3,"text":"my lab has done on two particular types of\nadversity."},"688":{"dur":4,"text":"One of the messages I want to leave you with\nis that not all adversity is created equal,"},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"in terms of how it impacts brain development."},"695":{"dur":4,"text":"That we actually find distinct patterns among\nchildren who have been exposed to different"},"699":{"dur":1,"text":"types of adverse experiences."},"701":{"dur":5,"text":"And I'm first going to talk about our research\nthat examines children who grow up in environments"},"707":{"dur":1,"text":"that are characterized by threat."},"708":{"dur":3,"text":"So think about the example of Michael, that\nI showed you at the beginning of the talk."},"712":{"dur":3,"text":"Michael was being raised in an environment\nthat's highly threatening."},"716":{"dur":5,"text":"So you can think about children who grow up\nexperiencing abuse, children who are growing"},"721":{"dur":4,"text":"up in families where there's domestic violence,\nchildren growing up in war-torn regions, like"},"726":{"dur":4,"text":"Syria or South Sudan, or children who grow\nup in communities where there happens to be"},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"a lot of violence in that community."},"733":{"dur":3,"text":"We know that about one in five children will\nexperience violence by the time they reach"},"737":{"dur":3,"text":"adulthood, and that many, many more children\naround the world grow up in these kinds of"},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"threatening environments."},"744":{"dur":6,"text":"So what I'm going to show you is that growing\nup in this kind of a threatening environment"},"750":{"dur":6,"text":"influences brain systems that are involved\nin emotional processing-- in ways that help"},"756":{"dur":4,"text":"the brain to rapidly identify other threats\nin the environment."},"760":{"dur":4,"text":"This is a very adaptive response to being\nraised in an environment that's characterized"},"765":{"dur":1,"text":"by danger."},"766":{"dur":4,"text":"So threatening experiences influence regions\nof the brain that help us identify threats"},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"and learn how to predict them in the future."},"774":{"dur":3,"text":"This involves regions that I'm going to tell\nyou about, like the amygdala, the hippocampus,"},"778":{"dur":1,"text":"and the prefrontal cortex."},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'll describe those regions a little bit\nmore as I start to show you some data."},"783":{"dur":1,"text":"So let's get to the data."},"785":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm first going to show you some research\nwe've done in my lab examining how exposure"},"789":{"dur":4,"text":"that's kind of threatening early environment\nimpacts the way that the brain responds to"},"794":{"dur":1,"text":"emotional information."},"796":{"dur":3,"text":"So in this study, we looked at children who\ngrew up in families where they experienced"},"799":{"dur":4,"text":"abuse, physical or sexual abuse, and children\nwho had never been exposed to violence."},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'm going to show you what the children\nsaw when they were in the MRI scanner in this"},"808":{"dur":1,"text":"experiment."},"809":{"dur":3,"text":"So some of the time they would see a cue that\nsimply told them to look at the image that"},"813":{"dur":1,"text":"we were about to show them."},"814":{"dur":3,"text":"And then we showed them images that might\nhave looked something like this."},"818":{"dur":3,"text":"Some of them were negative-- showing negative\nemotions."},"822":{"dur":4,"text":"Some of them were positive, showing positive\nemotions-- people being happy."},"826":{"dur":1,"text":"And some of them were totally neutral."},"827":{"dur":4,"text":"Although I like to think in Seattle, once\nI moved here from Boston-- this is not a good"},"832":{"dur":2,"text":"example of a neutral image."},"835":{"dur":1,"text":"OK."},"836":{"dur":5,"text":"So here's what happens in the brain when you\nare looking at emotional images."},"841":{"dur":1,"text":"This is in the entire sample."},"843":{"dur":4,"text":"What you see is that when kids were looking\nat negative images, you get activation in"},"847":{"dur":4,"text":"the set of regions known to be involved in\nemotional processing, like the amygdala, the"},"852":{"dur":3,"text":"hippocampus, and the medial part here of the\nprefrontal cortex."},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"Just to orient you, when you're looking at\nthe brain here, this is the outside of the"},"858":{"dur":1,"text":"brain."},"859":{"dur":3,"text":"These images here are if you took the brain\nand sliced it in half this way and opened"},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"it up, this is the back of the brain."},"865":{"dur":1,"text":"This is the front of the brain."},"867":{"dur":4,"text":"And you actually see that the pattern of brain\nactivation is really similar when you're looking"},"871":{"dur":2,"text":"at negative images and positive images."},"874":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's going to be important in a second,\nwhen I show you where we found differences"},"877":{"dur":4,"text":"in the brain, when as a function of whether\nor not kids grew up in a dangerous versus"},"882":{"dur":2,"text":"a safe environment."},"884":{"dur":1,"text":"And here's what we found."},"886":{"dur":4,"text":"So specifically, when children were looking\nat those negative images, we found that kids"},"890":{"dur":5,"text":"who had been exposed to violence had much\ngreater activation in this region of the brain"},"896":{"dur":3,"text":"called the amygdala than children who had\nnever been exposed to violence."},"900":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, the amygdala is a region of the brain\nthat helps us to identify threats in the environment"},"904":{"dur":2,"text":"and to learn about when they're going to happen."},"906":{"dur":3,"text":"You can kind of think of it as an alarm bell\nthat tells us when there's something really"},"910":{"dur":3,"text":"important that we need to pay attention to,\nespecially if there's something dangerous"},"914":{"dur":1,"text":"around."},"915":{"dur":4,"text":"And the way that you can interpret this is\nthat these kids who have experienced violence"},"920":{"dur":5,"text":"are finding those negative images to be much\nmore salient and much more potentially threatening."},"925":{"dur":3,"text":"Their brain is saying this is potentially\ndangerous-- you really need to pay attention"},"929":{"dur":1,"text":"to this."},"930":{"dur":1,"text":"And that makes sense, right?"},"931":{"dur":4,"text":"This would be an adaptive response if you\nwere trying to scan the environment for danger,"},"935":{"dur":2,"text":"in order to stay safe."},"938":{"dur":4,"text":"But we also found that this difference was\nnot just confined to the amygdala."},"943":{"dur":4,"text":"That it actually was in a whole network of\nbrain regions that help us identify salient"},"947":{"dur":1,"text":"cues in the environment."},"949":{"dur":5,"text":"Areas including the interior insula, the putamen,\nand the thalamus-- all of which help us identify"},"954":{"dur":3,"text":"things in the environment that we need to\npay attention to."},"958":{"dur":4,"text":"And so this suggests that negative emotional\ninformation that could signal the presence"},"962":{"dur":2,"text":"of threat is highly salient to these kids."},"965":{"dur":4,"text":"And their alarm bells are going off much more\nstrongly than kids who have never experienced"},"970":{"dur":1,"text":"violence."},"971":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, when we looked at differences in their\nresponses to positive emotion, we found something"},"975":{"dur":1,"text":"very different."},"977":{"dur":3,"text":"And that, in fact, we found no difference\nwhatsoever in how they were responding in"},"980":{"dur":3,"text":"the brain when they were looking at those\npositive images."},"983":{"dur":3,"text":"And this indicates that kids who've been exposed\nto violence are not just more reactive in"},"987":{"dur":2,"text":"general, they're not just more, kind of, emotional\nin general."},"990":{"dur":5,"text":"But rather that the effect is really specific\nto cues that could predict the presence of"},"995":{"dur":1,"text":"danger."},"996":{"dur":4,"text":"And critically, what we think is happening\nis that the brain is adapting to the environment"},"1001":{"dur":5,"text":"that these kids are being raised in, and helping\nthem to identify threat as rapidly as possible"},"1006":{"dur":1,"text":"so that they can stay safe."},"1008":{"dur":6,"text":"In that same study, we've also examined how\nkids are able to kind of modulate or regulate"},"1014":{"dur":2,"text":"their responses to emotional information."},"1017":{"dur":4,"text":"So, you know, the world would be a very different\nplace if we all walked around just, you know,"},"1021":{"dur":4,"text":"expressing our emotions without thinking first\nabout the context we're in, or whether we"},"1025":{"dur":2,"text":"should really say that to our boss."},"1027":{"dur":4,"text":"And so we're constantly kind of thinking about\nhow to respond appropriately, and modulating"},"1032":{"dur":3,"text":"our emotional responses to be appropriate\nfor our current context."},"1035":{"dur":3,"text":"So we were interested in what's going on in\nthe brain when children are trying to regulate"},"1039":{"dur":1,"text":"their emotions."},"1040":{"dur":3,"text":"So some of the time they would see a cue while\nthey were in the scanner that would tell them"},"1044":{"dur":5,"text":"to try to decrease the magnitude of their\nemotional response to a cue that might have"},"1049":{"dur":2,"text":"looked something like this."},"1052":{"dur":4,"text":"And some of the time they saw cues that asked\nthem to try to increase or magnify their emotional"},"1056":{"dur":3,"text":"response to a cue that might have looked like\nthis."},"1059":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, how did they do this?"},"1061":{"dur":4,"text":"So before they got in the scanner, we taught\nthem to engage in a really effective kind"},"1066":{"dur":4,"text":"of emotion regulation that's called cognitive\nreappraisal, which is a fancy way of simply"},"1070":{"dur":4,"text":"saying thinking about something in a different\nway, so that you change the way that you feel"},"1075":{"dur":1,"text":"about it."},"1076":{"dur":4,"text":"This is actually a technique that we use very\nfrequently in Cognitive Behavior Therapy and"},"1080":{"dur":2,"text":"other evidence-based treatments for mental\nhealth problems."},"1083":{"dur":3,"text":"So in this study, we taught the kids, when\nthey were looking at negative stimuli, to"},"1087":{"dur":2,"text":"try to kind of make it distant from them."},"1089":{"dur":5,"text":"To imagine that it was far away, that it wasn't\nreal, that the people, the situation, wasn't"},"1095":{"dur":1,"text":"relevant to them."},"1096":{"dur":3,"text":"And when they were looking at positive stimuli,\nwe asked them to do the opposite."},"1100":{"dur":2,"text":"So to immerse themself in the picture."},"1103":{"dur":3,"text":"To imagine that it was real, or that it was\nhappening to them."},"1106":{"dur":4,"text":"And the thing that is fascinating is that\nwhen we try to regulate our emotions in this"},"1111":{"dur":6,"text":"way, you can actually measure changes in the\namygdala in the brain."},"1117":{"dur":5,"text":"So when we try to regulate our emotions, we're\nusing this area in the front of the brain"},"1123":{"dur":1,"text":"called the prefrontal cortex."},"1124":{"dur":6,"text":"This is an area that helps us to plan, make\ndecisions, and to control our thoughts, our"},"1130":{"dur":1,"text":"emotions, and our behavior."},"1131":{"dur":3,"text":"It's kind of like the CEO of the brain."},"1134":{"dur":4,"text":"And what you can see is that when kids were\ntrying to reduce the intensity of their emotional"},"1139":{"dur":4,"text":"response to these pictures, you see that the\namount of activation in the amygdala goes"},"1144":{"dur":1,"text":"down."},"1145":{"dur":1,"text":"And we think this is pretty cool."},"1146":{"dur":3,"text":"You can actually measure how your brain is\nresponding differently when you

when they were trying to"},"1158":{"dur":1,"text":"regulate their emotions."},"1160":{"dur":4,"text":"So how does exposure to violence impact this\nemotion regulation process?"},"1165":{"dur":4,"text":"So what we found is that the kids who had\nbeen exposed to violence were recruiting these"},"1169":{"dur":4,"text":"regions in the prefrontal cortex that we know\nwere involved in this task to a much greater"},"1173":{"dur":3,"text":"degree than kids who had never experienced\nviolence."},"1177":{"dur":3,"text":"So the way you can think about this is, you\nremember that I just showed you that these"},"1181":{"dur":3,"text":"kids are having a much stronger amygdala response\nto negative images."},"1185":{"dur":1,"text":"They're reacting more strongly."},"1186":{"dur":4,"text":"So the idea here is that it might take more\ncognitive resources, or effort, for them to"},"1191":{"dur":2,"text":"try to dampen down that emotional response."},"1193":{"dur":4,"text":"It's harder, because there's a lot more reactivity\nthat they have to modulate."},"1197":{"dur":3,"text":"But we think that this actually might make\nit more difficult for them to use emotion"},"1201":{"dur":4,"text":"regulation in the real world when things are\nstressful, or they're distracted, or there's"},"1205":{"dur":1,"text":"a challenging situation."},"1207":{"dur":6,"text":"So emotion regulation is kind of more cognitively,\nor challenging, or effortful for them."},"1214":{"dur":4,"text":"But one finding from the study that I think\nis incredibly positive is that, although these"},"1218":{"dur":5,"text":"kids had to, kind of, use more cortical real\nestate to do this effective emotion regulation,"},"1223":{"dur":5,"text":"they were just as successful at reducing amygdala\nactivation as kids who had never been exposed"},"1228":{"dur":1,"text":"to abuse."},"1229":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is really promising, because these\nare the kinds of techniques that we use in"},"1233":{"dur":2,"text":"therapy for kids who have experienced trauma."},"1235":{"dur":4,"text":"And the idea here is, if we give kids effective\nstrategies for regulating their emotions,"},"1240":{"dur":1,"text":"they can do it."},"1241":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think this is an incredibly positive\nmessage about the plasticity of the brain,"},"1246":{"dur":3,"text":"even after extreme forms of adversity."},"1249":{"dur":4,"text":"So like I showed you before, there were no\ndifferences whatsoever in how the brain responded"},"1253":{"dur":5,"text":"to positive images-- again, suggesting that\nthe brain is changing in ways that are specific"},"1258":{"dur":2,"text":"to the environment that children have experienced."},"1261":{"dur":5,"text":"Threatening environments have a specific effect\non threat processing systems in the brain."},"1266":{"dur":5,"text":"So you may be wondering, was it really necessary\nto collect all this fancy brain data to show"},"1271":{"dur":4,"text":"that kids who've been exposed to violence\nare having stronger emotional reactions to"},"1276":{"dur":1,"text":"negative cues?"},"1277":{"dur":1,"text":"Couldn't we have learned that in other ways?"},"1278":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, in fact, in that same study, after each\ntrial, kids-- while they were in the scanner--"},"1282":{"dur":5,"text":"provided a self-report rating about how strongly\nthey were feeling about each of the images."},"1288":{"dur":3,"text":"And here's what we would have found if we\nhad simply looked at their own reports of"},"1291":{"dur":1,"text":"how they were feeling."},"1292":{"dur":3,"text":"We'd have found no differences in how they\nresponded to negative cues-- whether they"},"1296":{"dur":2,"text":"are simply looking at them, or trying to decrease."},"1299":{"dur":3,"text":"And in fact, all we would have found is that\nthey found those neutral images, like the"},"1302":{"dur":2,"text":"coffee cup, to be slightly more emotional."},"1305":{"dur":4,"text":"Which really suggests the value of using these\nmore sensitive measures of brain development"},"1310":{"dur":5,"text":"to understand how environmental experience\nis impacting children's development."},"1316":{"dur":6,"text":"So we've also seen that this heightened vigilance\nand heightened reactivity to threat that children"},"1322":{"dur":5,"text":"experience after exposure to violence has\ndownstream consequences on other aspects of"},"1327":{"dur":2,"text":"learning, that I'm going to tell you about\nnow."},"1330":{"dur":4,"text":"So specifically, I'm going to talk about one\nrecent example from my lab, where we examined"},"1334":{"dur":5,"text":"children's ability to learn about contextual\nthings in the environment."},"1339":{"dur":4,"text":"Cues all around us, like being in this lecture\nhall, that tell us where we are in space and"},"1344":{"dur":1,"text":"time."},"1345":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is work that's led by a graduate\nstudent in my lab named Hilary Lambert, who"},"1349":{"dur":2,"text":"I think is in the audience somewhere."},"1352":{"dur":7,"text":"So we frequently use contextual information\nto guide our behavior and our emotional responses."},"1360":{"dur":5,"text":"So a very simple example is that you would\nrespond very differently to a gunshot if you"},"1365":{"dur":3,"text":"heard it at an airport versus if you heard\nit at a shooting range."},"1369":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's a very simple example of how we're\nconstantly using the context in which we're"},"1373":{"dur":2,"text":"in to guide our behavior and our emotions."},"1376":{"dur":3,"text":"And one of the things that we often see in\nkids who have experienced violence is that"},"1379":{"dur":4,"text":"they have a hard time contextualizing, kind\nof, where they are."},"1383":{"dur":4,"text":"They might continue to exhibit persistent\nfear, even in contexts that are safe, where"},"1387":{"dur":1,"text":"they've never experienced violence."},"1389":{"dur":1,"text":"Like at school, for example."},"1390":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we were interested in studying this\nprocess."},"1393":{"dur":4,"text":"How does exposure to violence influence our\nability to use the context around us to guide"},"1397":{"dur":1,"text":"our emotional responses?"},"1399":{"dur":4,"text":"So in this experiment, while children were\nin an MRI scanner, we showed them pictures"},"1404":{"dur":1,"text":"that looked like this."},"1405":{"dur":4,"text":"They are pictures of faces that were embedded\nin realistic background images."},"1409":{"dur":2,"text":"Some of the faces were neutral."},"1412":{"dur":2,"text":"Some of the faces were angry, or threatening."},"1415":{"dur":1,"text":"And some of the faces were happy."},"1417":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, while the children were in the scanner,\nwe didn't ask them to focus on the background"},"1422":{"dur":1,"text":"context at all."},"1423":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, all we asked them to do was pay attention\nto the face."},"1426":{"dur":3,"text":"They would see the image, it would disappear,\nand then they got asked a question."},"1430":{"dur":3,"text":"Another face would appear, and they were simply\nasked, is this the same person that you just"},"1433":{"dur":1,"text":"saw?"},"1434":{"dur":3,"text":"So at the time, kids had no idea that they\nwere supposed to pay attention to the background."},"1438":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's kind of important."},"1439":{"dur":3,"text":"Because context is something that happens\nin the background of more salient cues."},"1443":{"dur":4,"text":"And as soon as you kind of ask people to focus\non it, it's not the background anymore."},"1447":{"dur":3,"text":"So the kids had to kind of not realize that\nwe were interested in whether or not they"},"1451":{"dur":3,"text":"were encoding this information that happened\nin the background."},"1454":{"dur":3,"text":"And then, when they got outside the scanner,\nwe gave them a surprise test."},"1458":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is about an hour later."},"1460":{"dur":3,"text":"This is the first time they realized that\nthey were going to be asked about whether"},"1463":{"dur":5,"text":"this, sort of, background contextual information\nthat these faces appeared upon."},"1469":{"dur":5,"text":"And specifically, we asked them to say whether\nthey had previously seen this person in this"},"1475":{"dur":1,"text":"place."},"1476":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, you might think, that seems really hard."},"1477":{"dur":1,"text":"You didn't tell them to pay attention to context."},"1479":{"dur":1,"text":"Could they do it?"},"1480":{"dur":2,"text":"And it turns out they could do it pretty well."},"1482":{"dur":1,"text":"So chance would be 50%."},"1484":{"dur":3,"text":"You can see that the kids are performing much\nbetter than chance on this task."},"1487":{"dur":3,"text":"And about 2\/3 of the time they're able to\nget it right, even though they didn't know"},"1491":{"dur":2,"text":"that they were going to be tested on this\ncontextual information."},"1494":{"dur":5,"text":"This kind of speaks to this sort of implicit\nprocessing of where we are in space and time"},"1499":{"dur":4,"text":"that we're always engaging in, even though\nit's not a very conscious or explicit process."},"1504":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, while the kids were encoding those faces\nembedded within scenes, this is what was going"},"1509":{"dur":1,"text":"on in their brain."},"1510":{"dur":5,"text":"Now in particular, they were utilizing this\nregion of the brain, this posterior part of"},"1515":{"dur":1,"text":"the hippocampus."},"1517":{"dur":4,"text":"The hippocampus is a region of the brain that\nwe know is involved in learning and memory,"},"1522":{"dur":1,"text":"spatial navigation."},"1523":{"dur":4,"text":"But it's particularly involved in helping\nus sort of encode and process background contextual"},"1528":{"dur":3,"text":"information as we navigate through the world."},"1531":{"dur":4,"text":"And what we actually saw is that the degree\nto which kids were activating this area in"},"1536":{"dur":4,"text":"the hippocampus, while they were looking at\nthose faces embedded within scenes, the better"},"1541":{"dur":2,"text":"they did on that memory test outside the scanner."},"1543":{"dur":4,"text":"So the more you activate this area in the\nhippocampus, the better you were able to remember"},"1548":{"dur":3,"text":"the pairings of faces with background scenes."},"1551":{"dur":4,"text":"So how does exposure to violence impact this\nprocess?"},"1555":{"dur":3,"text":"So what we found, again, was something very\nspecific."},"1558":{"dur":4,"text":"We found that kids who had been exposed to\nabuse and violence were performing worse at"},"1563":{"dur":4,"text":"this memory test, but only if the face that\nthey were looking at was angry."},"1568":{"dur":1,"text":"OK?"},"1569":{"dur":2,"text":"So angry faces are a very reliable threat\ncue."},"1571":{"dur":4,"text":"When someone is angry, that's a pretty certain\ncue that something dangerous could happen."},"1576":{"dur":3,"text":"So only in the presence of that threatening\ncue were the kids who had been exposed to"},"1580":{"dur":3,"text":"violence performing worse on this memory test."},"1583":{"dur":5,"text":"And it turns out that, again, specifically,\njust when the face was angry, they were recruiting"},"1589":{"dur":4,"text":"this brain region-- the hippocampus, that\nwe know is important for this task-- less"},"1594":{"dur":3,"text":"than kids who had never experienced violence."},"1597":{"dur":2,"text":"And they weren't just recruiting the hippocampus\nless."},"1600":{"dur":4,"text":"They were actually activating a totally different\nnetwork of brain regions."},"1604":{"dur":3,"text":"So sometimes in MRI, we're interested not\njust in one brain region, but in how multiple"},"1608":{"dur":4,"text":"brain regions are kind of working together\nto perform a particular kind of cognitive"},"1613":{"dur":2,"text":"or emotional function."},"1615":{"dur":4,"text":"And what we saw is that kids who had never\nexperienced violence were recruiting a network"},"1619":{"dur":2,"text":"that we know is involved in memory-- working\nmemory."},"1622":{"dur":2,"text":"Holding things in mind for a short period\nof time."},"1625":{"dur":4,"text":"But in contrast, kids who had been exposed\nto abuse were activating this region in kind"},"1630":{"dur":5,"text":"of the lower, or ventral, and lateral part\nof the prefrontal cortex that we know is involved"},"1635":{"dur":1,"text":"in orienting to threat."},"1637":{"dur":4,"text":"When there's a threat in the environment,\nthis region of the brain becomes active, and"},"1641":{"dur":3,"text":"it shifts your attention to focus on that\nthreat."},"1645":{"dur":4,"text":"So we were interested-- is recruitment of\nthis different network predicting how well"},"1649":{"dur":2,"text":"the kids performed on this task?"},"1651":{"dur":1,"text":"And in fact, it did."},"1652":{"dur":1,"text":"It was a very strong predictor."},"1654":{"dur":5,"text":"So the more the kids were using this alternative\nkind of threat-orienting brain network, the"},"1659":{"dur":5,"text":"worse they were able to remember those faces\noutside the scanner, if the face was angry"},"1665":{"dur":2,"text":"when they were trying to remember."},"1667":{"dur":2,"text":"So what does this mean?"},"1670":{"dur":4,"text":"So the basic idea is that if you have grown\nup in an environment that's dangerous and"},"1674":{"dur":4,"text":"you see something like this-- an angry face--\nsomething threatening-- your attention is"},"1678":{"dur":3,"text":"going to hone in like a laser beam on this\nthreat."},"1682":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's going to come at the expense of you\nprocessing the background context around you."},"1687":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, of course this context is very important\nfor helping us to modulate our emotions, right?"},"1692":{"dur":5,"text":"And so this might explain why kids who have\nbeen exposed to violence often exhibit persistent"},"1698":{"dur":4,"text":"fear, even in contexts where they've never\nexperienced danger, because they're just less"},"1702":{"dur":4,"text":"able to use that background context to shape\ntheir behavior and emotions, because they're"},"1706":{"dur":1,"text":"not paying attention to it."},"1708":{"dur":2,"text":"They're paying attention to the threat that's\nright in front of them."},"1711":{"dur":6,"text":"Now I want to emphasize again that these adaptations--\nbeing highly attuned to threats in the environment"},"1718":{"dur":4,"text":"and preferentially focusing on predictors\nof threat-- this is an adaptive response."},"1722":{"dur":3,"text":"If you were growing up in an environment that's\ncharacterized by danger, you want your brain"},"1726":{"dur":1,"text":"to do this."},"1727":{"dur":4,"text":"So I want you to take away not that these\nkids' brains are-- there's something wrong"},"1732":{"dur":1,"text":"with them."},"1733":{"dur":1,"text":"Not at all."},"1734":{"dur":1,"text":"These kids are adapting to the context they're\nin."},"1735":{"dur":4,"text":"And they're shifting their information processing\nin exactly the way they need to, to stay safe."},"1740":{"dur":6,"text":"But we also know that these patterns of brain\nactivity can have long-term implications for"},"1747":{"dur":4,"text":"these kids' mental health, and their ability\nto be successful in life."},"1752":{"dur":4,"text":"So we had a unique opportunity to look at\nwhat these patterns of brain activity might"},"1756":{"dur":2,"text":"predict in the long term about these kids'\nsuccess."},"1759":{"dur":4,"text":"So in that first study I showed you, where\nwe simply showed kids emotional images, that"},"1763":{"dur":2,"text":"was a study that I conducted when my lab was\nstill in Boston."},"1766":{"dur":5,"text":"And while we were midway through the study,\na terrorist attack happened in Boston."},"1771":{"dur":2,"text":"Most of you probably remember this."},"1773":{"dur":4,"text":"There were two bombs that were detonated at\nthe finish line of the Boston Marathon."},"1778":{"dur":5,"text":"Multiple spectators were killed, and hundreds\nof people were injured."},"1783":{"dur":4,"text":"And so in the ensuing days after this event,\nthe city of Boston was really in a state of"},"1788":{"dur":2,"text":"kind of heightened alert, and heightened threat."},"1791":{"dur":5,"text":"News outlets widely circulated rumors about\nother bombs in the city."},"1796":{"dur":4,"text":"There were National Guards stationed throughout\nthe public transportation system."},"1800":{"dur":3,"text":"And a large area of downtown Boston was roped\noff as a crime scene."},"1804":{"dur":7,"text":"A few days after the bombing, the FBI released\nphotographs of the suspected perpetrators,"},"1812":{"dur":5,"text":"and really an unprecedented event in modern\nAmerica history happened-- which is that the"},"1817":{"dur":4,"text":"entire city of Boston was closed down for\na day, in the middle of the week."},"1822":{"dur":1,"text":"Schools were closed."},"1823":{"dur":1,"text":"Public transportation was closed."},"1824":{"dur":5,"text":"Essentially, everyone was indoors, glued to\nCNN, watching this, kind of, high speed chase"},"1830":{"dur":4,"text":"unfold for the perpetrators of this incident."},"1834":{"dur":6,"text":"And we know that exposure to this kind of\ninformation in the media-- even if you weren't"},"1840":{"dur":4,"text":"standing at the finish line where the bombs\nwere detonated-- simply seeing about this"},"1844":{"dur":5,"text":"kind of dangerous, threatening, frightening\ninformation is enough to trigger symptoms"},"1850":{"dur":2,"text":"of PTSD in children and in adolescents."},"1852":{"dur":5,"text":"So Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, or PTSD,\nis a mental health problem where people have,"},"1858":{"dur":5,"text":"kind of, intrusive thoughts and memories about\nsomething very scary that they experienced."},"1863":{"dur":3,"text":"They tend to avoid things that remind them\nabout what happened."},"1867":{"dur":2,"text":"They have a lot of negative thoughts and emotions."},"1870":{"dur":5,"text":"They can have difficulty sleeping, concentrating,\nand feel very, kind of, on edge and hypervigilant."},"1875":{"dur":3,"text":"And what we found is actually that-- you'll\nremember, that first finding I showed you"},"1879":{"dur":6,"text":"where maltreated kids had greater activation\nin the amygdala-- we found that the more you"},"1886":{"dur":3,"text":"activated your amygdala to those negative\nimages-- so the more that you're sounding"},"1889":{"dur":4,"text":"that alarm bell when you see something negative\nin the environment-- the more likely you were"},"1893":{"dur":5,"text":"to develop PTSD symptoms specifically related\nto this novel traumatic stressor that happen"},"1899":{"dur":1,"text":"to everyone in the Boston area."},"1900":{"dur":1,"text":"OK?"},"1901":{"dur":3,"text":"Which suggests that, while these patterns\nof brain activity may be helping kids adapt"},"1905":{"dur":3,"text":"in the short term, they come at a cost."},"1908":{"dur":4,"text":"And they're predicting higher likelihood of\nmental health problems down the line."},"1913":{"dur":1,"text":"OK."},"1914":{"dur":2,"text":"So let me give you kind of a brief interim\nsummary."},"1916":{"dur":5,"text":"So we see that kids who have been exposed\nto violence have greater amygdala reactivity"},"1922":{"dur":4,"text":"to negative emotional cues-- negative things\nin the environment-- that when they're trying"},"1926":{"dur":4,"text":"to regulate their responses to those cues,\nto modulate the intensity of their negative"},"1930":{"dur":3,"text":"emotions, they have to use, kind of, more\nreal estate in the prefrontal cortex to do"},"1934":{"dur":1,"text":"it, which suggests it's harder for them."},"1936":{"dur":1,"text":"It's more effortful."},"1938":{"dur":4,"text":"That when there's a threat in the environment,\nthese kids are kind of unable to take in information"},"1942":{"dur":6,"text":"about the background context, and they exhibit\nbrain differences in an area called the hippocampus"},"1949":{"dur":3,"text":"that helps us to learn about where we are\nin the environment, and use that information"},"1953":{"dur":1,"text":"to modulate our behavior."},"1954":{"dur":6,"text":"And together, these changes in the brain appear\nto place children at risk for developing anxiety,"},"1960":{"dur":2,"text":"and PTSD later."},"1963":{"dur":1,"text":"OK."},"1964":{"dur":1,"text":"So I want to switch gears."},"1966":{"dur":4,"text":"And for the rest of the talk, I'm going to\ntalk about a very different kind of adversity."},"1971":{"dur":4,"text":"So I've shown you about some of the effects\nof growing up in an environment that's characterized"},"1976":{"dur":2,"text":"by danger and by violence."},"1978":{"dur":4,"text":"But now I'm going to talk to you about what\nwe've learned about growing up in an environment"},"1982":{"dur":1,"text":"that's characterized by deprivation."},"1983":{"dur":7,"text":"And when I say deprivation, I mean an environment\nthat's lacking in consistent cognitive stimulation,"},"1991":{"dur":5,"text":"interactions with adults, and kind of complexity,\nand learning opportunities in the environment."},"1996":{"dur":4,"text":"This is an environment that is common among\nkids who grew up in orphanages, which is at"},"2000":{"dur":2,"text":"least 10 million children around the world."},"2003":{"dur":1,"text":"Children who are neglected."},"2004":{"dur":3,"text":"And even children who grow up in poverty."},"2007":{"dur":4,"text":"This is the kind of environment, you'll remember\nat the beginning, that Sarah is being raised"},"2011":{"dur":1,"text":"in."},"2012":{"dur":5,"text":"So what, exactly, do I mean by deprivation,\nand cognitive stimulation, and complexity?"},"2017":{"dur":1,"text":"Let me make this real concrete."},"2019":{"dur":5,"text":"So this is seminal work by Hart and Risley\nwhich showed that among children in the United"},"2024":{"dur":5,"text":"States, by the age of four years, children\ngrowing up in poverty, on average, have heard"},"2030":{"dur":1,"text":"30 million fewer words."},"2031":{"dur":1,"text":"30 million."},"2033":{"dur":1,"text":"Take that in."},"2034":{"dur":4,"text":"30 million fewer words than kids who are growing\nup in middle class families."},"2039":{"dur":4,"text":"And this is just one simple example of the\nkind of deprivation I'm talking about, where"},"2043":{"dur":5,"text":"your brain is not getting the kinds of stimulation\nfrom the environment that it sort of expects,"},"2049":{"dur":1,"text":"to develop normally."},"2050":{"dur":5,"text":"Other kinds of deprivation include a lack\nof stimulation from consistent interactions"},"2055":{"dur":5,"text":"with adults, lack of enriching experiences,\neither in the home or at school, and lack"},"2061":{"dur":4,"text":"of consistent rules, routines, and structures,\nall of which are things our brain kind of"},"2065":{"dur":3,"text":"expects from the environment as we're developing."},"2068":{"dur":2,"text":"So how does deprivation impact the brain?"},"2071":{"dur":5,"text":"One of the things we learned about when inputs\nto the brain are lacking in sensory areas--"},"2077":{"dur":5,"text":"like, if you blindfold animals early in development\nand don't let any light come into the eye--"},"2082":{"dur":4,"text":"we've learned that one of the primary ways\nthrough which experience shapes the development"},"2086":{"dur":5,"text":"of the brain is by pruning away of synaptic\nconnections that we produce way too many of"},"2092":{"dur":4,"text":"early in development, and then, sort of, get\nrid of through the rest of life, based on"},"2096":{"dur":1,"text":"our experience."},"2097":{"dur":5,"text":"This is one of the ways that experience molds\nthe brain over time."},"2103":{"dur":4,"text":"And the basic idea is that there are a lot\nof inputs that our brain is expecting from"},"2107":{"dur":1,"text":"the environment."},"2108":{"dur":1,"text":"We expect light to come into our eyes."},"2110":{"dur":2,"text":"We expect sound waves to come into our ears."},"2112":{"dur":2,"text":"We expect to hear language."},"2114":{"dur":4,"text":"And there's a lot of synaptic connections\nthat are created to process those inputs."},"2119":{"dur":2,"text":"And when those inputs are absent, our brain\nsays, OK."},"2121":{"dur":1,"text":"This connection?"},"2122":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't really need it."},"2123":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to prune it away."},"2125":{"dur":5,"text":"And so what you can see here is kind of a\ndiagram of how this happens across development"},"2130":{"dur":1,"text":"in the human brain."},"2132":{"dur":4,"text":"Early on, for the first few years of life,\nthere's this proliferation of connections"},"2136":{"dur":2,"text":"between different neurons in the brain."},"2138":{"dur":4,"text":"And then, really, for the rest of of our lives,\nthese connections are being pruned away."},"2142":{"dur":5,"text":"And essentially what the system is doing is,\nit's becoming more efficient and more effective"},"2147":{"dur":2,"text":"for the environment in which it's developing."},"2150":{"dur":1,"text":"It's getting rid of things it's not utilizing."},"2152":{"dur":5,"text":"It's getting rid of pathways that are inefficient,\nto create kind of the most effective information"},"2157":{"dur":4,"text":"processing system for the environment in which\nit's developing."},"2161":{"dur":4,"text":"And we can actually, remarkably, see this\nprocess of synaptic pruning when we look at"},"2165":{"dur":2,"text":"measures of gray matter volume in the human\nbrain."},"2168":{"dur":4,"text":"Where you see a very similar pattern of an\nincrease early in life that's followed by"},"2172":{"dur":2,"text":"a decrease throughout the rest of the life."},"2174":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're all on this trajectory here."},"2177":{"dur":1,"text":"Right?"},"2178":{"dur":1,"text":"We're all getting-- our brains are getting\nsmaller."},"2179":{"dur":1,"text":"But that's not a bad thing."},"2181":{"dur":3,"text":"When it happens in a normal way, our brains\nare becoming more efficient."},"2184":{"dur":3,"text":"We're getting rid of stuff we don't need to\nprocess information effectively."},"2188":{"dur":6,"text":"However, this process, this normal process\nof synaptic pruning can be hijacked by an"},"2194":{"dur":4,"text":"environment that is lacking in input that\nour

the\nfirst, like, few months of life, and kind"},"2215":{"dur":2,"text":"of see what happened to their visual system."},"2217":{"dur":5,"text":"And what happened is that the synaptic connections\nthroughout the visual cortex in the back of"},"2222":{"dur":3,"text":"the brain weren't getting utilized, and the\nbrain just got rid of them."},"2226":{"dur":1,"text":"The brain said, I'm not using this."},"2227":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't need it."},"2228":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to get rid of it."},"2229":{"dur":5,"text":"So you saw this early and extreme synaptic\npruning, that, once it's gone, it's very difficult"},"2234":{"dur":2,"text":"to, kind of, get those connections back later."},"2237":{"dur":4,"text":"And you actually see a similar pattern in\nstudies,

cortex."},"2249":{"dur":4,"text":"So what that means is, the synapses that are\ngetting pruned away?"},"2253":{"dur":4,"text":"When you have that happening on a massive\nscale, your brain actually gets thinner."},"2257":{"dur":2,"text":"The gray matter in the brain shrinks."},"2260":{"dur":2,"text":"And so this is what happens with sensory deprivation."},"2262":{"dur":3,"text":"So what about the kinds of social and cognitive\ndeprivation that we study?"},"2266":{"dur":1,"text":"Like kids who are neglected?"},"2267":{"dur":4,"text":"So on the top panel here, you can see what\nwe think is going on in a typical developmental"},"2272":{"dur":2,"text":"environment, where there's lots of stimulation\nin the environment."},"2274":{"dur":3,"text":"Lots of different neurons are kind of connecting\nand communicating with each other as the child"},"2278":{"dur":5,"text":"learns and hears complex language, interacts\nwith an adult, and this is how the cortex"},"2284":{"dur":1,"text":"develops."},"2285":{"dur":4,"text":"Now in contrast, down here, you can see an\nenvironment where a child is not hearing a"},"2289":{"dur":4,"text":"lot of language, not having a lot of interaction\nwith adults, not getting a lot of this kind"},"2294":{"dur":3,"text":"of learning and stimulation from the environment."},"2297":{"dur":4,"text":"And so in the places

connection?"},"2305":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not using it."},"2306":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm just going to get rid of it."},"2307":{"dur":4,"text":"And when that happens on a wide scale, the\ncortex itself becomes thinner."},"2311":{"dur":3,"text":"And this kind of folded gray matter that we\nhave on the outside of the brain actually"},"2315":{"dur":1,"text":"gets smaller."},"2317":{"dur":1,"text":"OK."},"2318":{"dur":5,"text":"So let me show you some data to suggest that\nthis is how early deprivation impacts the"},"2323":{"dur":1,"text":"brain."},"2324":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going to show you just one piece of data\nfrom a study that you're going to hear a lot"},"2327":{"dur":3,"text":"about in just a few minutes, with our second\nlecture."},"2330":{"dur":5,"text":"And this study is called the Bucharest Early\nIntervention Project, a really innovative"},"2336":{"dur":4,"text":"study led by Chuck

were eight to 10 years old."},"2380":{"dur":5,"text":"But first, I want to just say one, sort of,\nthing about the nature of deprivation in this"},"2386":{"dur":1,"text":"environment."},"2387":{"dur":3,"text":"So these kids are isolated."},"2390":{"dur":2,"text":"They have little interactions with adults."},"2393":{"dur":3,"text":"The number of children to adults is very high."},"2397":{"dur":4,"text":"So they have very little consistent interaction\nwith caregivers."},"2401":{"dur":4,"text":"The caregivers tend to have low investment\nin the kids, because they work rotating shifts."},"2406":{"dur":3,"text":"They don't take care of the same children\nall the time."},"2409":{"dur":3,"text":"And there's too many children for every adult."},"2412":{"dur":2,"text":"And the environment really lacks cognitive\nstimulation."},"2415":{"dur":4,"text":"These children rarely hear language, especially\nlanguage that's directed to them, which we"},"2419":{"dur":2,"text":"know really facilitates learning early in\ndevelopment."},"2422":{"dur":3,"text":"And the environment is highly routinized,\nwhich you can kind of see in this heartbreaking"},"2426":{"dur":1,"text":"picture here."},"2427":{"dur":4,"text":"So the kids then only, you know, have meals\nat the same time every day, and have playtime"},"2432":{"dur":4,"text":"at the same time every day, and they even\nare kind of forced to go to the bathroom all"},"2436":{"dur":1,"text":"together at the same time."},"2438":{"dur":1,"text":"Environment is highly routinized."},"2439":{"dur":2,"text":"There's not a lot of individualized care."},"2442":{"dur":4,"text":"So we studied the brains of these children,\nagain, using MRI."},"2446":{"dur":3,"text":"But instead of Functional MRI, which I've\nbeen telling you about, which looks at how"},"2450":{"dur":5,"text":"the brain is activating, we use Structural\nMRI, which lets us measure the size of different"},"2455":{"dur":1,"text":"areas of the brain."},"2457":{"dur":2,"text":"So I just briefly want to describe how this\nworks."},"2459":{"dur":3,"text":"So basically, this is how the brain looks\nto MRI."},"2462":{"dur":5,"text":"When you're doing the Structural MRI, essentially\nwhat it does is, it says-- it takes the brain"},"2468":{"dur":4,"text":"and breaks it into these tiny little cubes\nthat we call voxels."},"2472":{"dur":2,"text":"And it says, is it white or is it gray?"},"2474":{"dur":1,"text":"That's basically what MRI is doing."},"2475":{"dur":2,"text":"It's remarkably simple at that level."},"2478":{"dur":5,"text":"The white matter are the axons-- the projections\nfrom one neuron to another."},"2483":{"dur":4,"text":"And the gray matter, which I'm going to talk\nabout, includes the neurons themselves, the"},"2487":{"dur":2,"text":"dendrites, and all the synaptic connections\nbetween the neurons."},"2490":{"dur":5,"text":"The things that we think get pruned away in\nthe absence of stimulation from the environment."},"2495":{"dur":5,"text":"So how does this, kind of, early deprivation\nimpact the structure of the developing brain?"},"2501":{"dur":7,"text":"So consistent with this idea that an environment\nlacking in stimulation and consistent interaction"},"2508":{"dur":4,"text":"with adults is going to lead to extreme and\nearly synaptic pruning, we found that these"},"2513":{"dur":3,"text":"are the groups of kids who grew up in this\nearly deprived environment."},"2516":{"dur":2,"text":"These are kids growing up in families in the\ncommunity."},"2518":{"dur":5,"text":"We find a drastic reduction in gray matter\nvolume across the entire cortex."},"2523":{"dur":4,"text":"Again, the cortex is the folded part of the\nbrain on the outside."},"2528":{"dur":2,"text":"So the cortex is smaller."},"2530":{"dur":2,"text":"But we're most interested in this measure\nof cortical thickness."},"2533":{"dur":2,"text":"So the cortex is actually not very thick."},"2535":{"dur":1,"text":"Just a few millimeters."},"2536":{"dur":4,"text":"And the measure that we think most closely\nreflects synaptic pruning is how thick the"},"2540":{"dur":1,"text":"cortex is."},"2542":{"dur":4,"text":"So what I'm showing you here-- areas in blue\nare areas where the kids who grew up in this"},"2546":{"dur":6,"text":"deprived environment have thinner cortex than\nthe kids who grew up in a typical family environment."},"2553":{"dur":3,"text":"There are no regions of the brain that are\nthicker in these children."},"2556":{"dur":4,"text":"So what we see is really a wide-spread pattern\nof cortical thinning."},"2560":{"dur":5,"text":"We see that it's most pronounced in areas\nof the brain that process language."},"2566":{"dur":5,"text":"Areas in the prefrontal cortex that we know\nare involved in emotion regulation, and executive"},"2571":{"dur":1,"text":"functioning."},"2572":{"dur":4,"text":"And regions throughout the parietal cortex\nthat are involved in functions like memory"},"2576":{"dur":1,"text":"and attention."},"2578":{"dur":2,"text":"So does this matter?"},"2580":{"dur":4,"text":"So what are the implications of this pattern\nof accelerated cortical thinning that we're"},"2585":{"dur":3,"text":"observing in kids who grow up in this deprived\nenvironment?"},"2588":{"dur":6,"text":"So critically, we observe a similar pattern\namong kids who are exposed to this early deprivation"},"2595":{"dur":4,"text":"in cognitive tasks that rely on those areas\nof the brain that were thinning too quickly."},"2600":{"dur":4,"text":"So when we give them tasks of working memory--\nessentially show them something, have it go"},"2604":{"dur":4,"text":"away and ask them to remember, to sort of\nmatch to which one of these things they just"},"2609":{"dur":3,"text":"saw-- they perform much worse."},"2612":{"dur":4,"text":"And when we give them tasks involving planning--\nso to think about a strategy for solving a"},"2617":{"dur":3,"text":"problem before they solve it-- they also perform\nmuch worse."},"2620":{"dur":4,"text":"These are regions we know rely on the prefrontal\ncortex and the parietal cortex-- those areas"},"2624":{"dur":2,"text":"that were thinning faster."},"2627":{"dur":4,"text":"And more critically, perhaps, we also see\na very similar pattern in levels of ADHD."},"2632":{"dur":4,"text":"In fact, kids who grow up in orphanages--\nnot just in this study, but in many studies--"},"2636":{"dur":4,"text":"have been shown to have levels of ADHD that\nare four to five times higher than kids who"},"2641":{"dur":1,"text":"were growing up in families in the community."},"2642":{"dur":5,"text":"And so we were curious about whether this\naccelerated pattern of cortical thinning might"},"2647":{"dur":4,"text":"explain why we see this very high rate of\nADHD in these children."},"2652":{"dur":5,"text":"And so in fact, what we found is that the\nrelationship between early deprivation-- growing"},"2658":{"dur":5,"text":"up in this orphanage, and symptoms of inattention,\na core feature of ADHD-- about 2\/3 of that"},"2663":{"dur":4,"text":"association was explained by these atypical\npatterns of brain development."},"2667":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, a way you can think about this is that\nif we could alter this trajectory of brain"},"2671":{"dur":5,"text":"development by changing the environment, we\ncould reduce symptoms of ADHD by 65% in these"},"2677":{"dur":1,"text":"kids."},"2678":{"dur":3,"text":"And more strikingly, when we looked at symptoms\nof hyperactivity, the other core feature of"},"2681":{"dur":4,"text":"ADHD, we actually found that these atypical\npatterns of brain development explained about"},"2685":{"dur":1,"text":"80% of that relationship."},"2687":{"dur":4,"text":"Again suggesting that if we could change this\ntrajectory in some way, we could theoretically"},"2692":{"dur":5,"text":"prevent or reduce about 80% of hyperactivity\nsymptoms in these kids."},"2697":{"dur":4,"text":"So you may be thinking to yourself, OK, how\nmany kids are really raised in these terrible"},"2702":{"dur":1,"text":"orphanage settings?"},"2703":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe not so many."},"2704":{"dur":2,"text":"What about other deprived environments, though?"},"2707":{"dur":4,"text":"And what we see is actually that kids growing\nup in deprived environments here in the United"},"2711":{"dur":4,"text":"States actually exhibit very similar patterns\nof brain development."},"2716":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'm just going to show you one example."},"2718":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'm going to talk about kids who are growing\nup in poverty."},"2721":{"dur":6,"text":"So we know that about 20%-- actually 25% now--\nof kids in the United States are growing up"},"2728":{"dur":3,"text":"in a family that's below the federal poverty\nline."},"2731":{"dur":5,"text":"And growing up in a family with low income,\nwith low parental education, is associated"},"2736":{"dur":1,"text":"with it."},"2737":{"dur":4,"text":"It's not a one-to-one predictor, but it's\nassociated with a variety of kinds of deprivation."},"2741":{"dur":3,"text":"So I showed you early on the findings regarding\ncomplex language."},"2745":{"dur":3,"text":"Kids get remarkably lower levels of language\nstimulation early in development."},"2749":{"dur":4,"text":"They experience material deprivation-- so\ninconsistent access to food and shelter--"},"2754":{"dur":4,"text":"and far fewer enriching cognitive experiences\nin the home and outside the home, as well"},"2758":{"dur":1,"text":"as supervision by adults."},"2760":{"dur":3,"text":"And what's remarkable-- this is actually data\nthat's not from my lab."},"2764":{"dur":3,"text":"This is from Allyson Mackey's lab, who is\nnow at Penn."},"2767":{"dur":5,"text":"She has shown a remarkably similar pattern\nof reductions in cortical thickness among"},"2772":{"dur":2,"text":"kids right here in the United States who are\ngrowing up in poverty."},"2775":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, this map looks a little different."},"2777":{"dur":3,"text":"These blobs are bigger, because of differences\nin how the statistics were calculated."},"2781":{"dur":3,"text":"But what you can see is that the areas of\nthe brain where you're seeing this accelerated"},"2784":{"dur":4,"text":"thinning are very similar to the patterns\nI just showed you among the kids growing up"},"2789":{"dur":1,"text":"in those orphanages."},"2790":{"dur":4,"text":"That growing up in poverty here in the United\nStates seems to be impacting the trajectory"},"2794":{"dur":4,"text":"of how the brain is developing in a similar\nway, although it's certainly less extreme."},"2799":{"dur":4,"text":"But all of these areas that you see in red\nand yellow are areas that are thinner in kids"},"2803":{"dur":5,"text":"who are growing up in poverty than among kids\nwho are growing up in middle class families."},"2809":{"dur":6,"text":"So to summarize, we see that exposure to deprivation\nis associated with this accelerated cortical"},"2815":{"dur":4,"text":"thinning across many areas of the brain, but\nin particular, regions of the brain that support"},"2820":{"dur":3,"text":"complex cognition, like memory, attention,\nand language."},"2824":{"dur":1,"text":"Decision making."},"2826":{"dur":3,"text":"We think that this accelerated thinning is\nreflecting a process where the brain is pruning"},"2829":{"dur":6,"text":"away connections that are not getting utilized,\nbecause the environment is not stimulating."},"2836":{"dur":5,"text":"And that this accelerated cortical thinning\nleads to reduced performance on a whole variety"},"2841":{"dur":1,"text":"of complex cognitive tasks."},"2842":{"dur":1,"text":"I just showed you a few."},"2844":{"dur":3,"text":"But there are many domains, especially in\nthe domain of language and in the domain of"},"2848":{"dur":1,"text":"what we call executive functioning."},"2849":{"dur":5,"text":"Being able to hold things in mind, think about\nthe future, make good decisions."},"2854":{"dur":4,"text":"These are all areas that are strongly impacted\nby deprivation and by the brain areas where"},"2859":{"dur":2,"text":"we see accelerated thinning."},"2862":{"dur":5,"text":"And these changes in the brain appear to place\nchildren at risk for developing ADHD and other"},"2867":{"dur":3,"text":"types of behavior problems later in development."},"2871":{"dur":3,"text":"So I want to end on a more positive note."},"2874":{"dur":8,"text":"So I think that the work that I've been showing\nyou, the integration of brain science with"},"2882":{"dur":6,"text":"understanding the impacts of adversity really\nhas the potential to lead us to the next critical"},"2889":{"dur":6,"text":"step in this field, which is to use the neuroscience\nmethods to improve interventions for children"},"2895":{"dur":1,"text":"who are growing up in adversity."},"2896":{"dur":3,"text":"So I want to highlight two examples of how\nI think neuroscience can be useful in this"},"2900":{"dur":1,"text":"regard."},"2901":{"dur":4,"text":"So the first example is in relation to the\nwork I first showed you on threat."},"2905":{"dur":4,"text":"In particular, I showed you that cognitive\nreappraisal-- thinking about something in"},"2909":{"dur":4,"text":"a different way to change its emotional meaning--\ncan modulate the degree to which your amygdala"},"2914":{"dur":2,"text":"is responding to things in the environment."},"2916":{"dur":4,"text":"Now remember, the amygdala is this kind of\nalarm bell that we see going off way stronger"},"2921":{"dur":4,"text":"in kids who have grown up in dangerous environments,\ncompared to kids who haven't."},"2926":{"dur":6,"text":"So we see that teaching kids, even in a simple\nMRI experiment, how to use cognitive reappraisal"},"2932":{"dur":4,"text":"leads these kids to be able to modulate their\namygdala very effectively."},"2937":{"dur":4,"text":"And we know that this kind of cognitive reappraisal\nstrategy, this is kind of a cornerstone of"},"2942":{"dur":4,"text":"many of our evidence-based treatments, including\nsomething we call Trauma-Focused Cognitive"},"2946":{"dur":4,"text":"Behavior Therapy, which as a side note is\nsomething else that people here in the psychology"},"2950":{"dur":3,"text":"department at U-Dub, including Shannon Dorsey,\nstudy."},"2953":{"dur":3,"text":"How do we get kids this effective treatment\nthat we know works?"},"2956":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think what the neuroscience suggests\nis that these kinds of strategies, that we"},"2960":{"dur":4,"text":"often don't use until kids have shown up in\na clinic exhibiting a lot of problems with"},"2965":{"dur":4,"text":"anxiety and fear, could actually be used as\na preventive strategy."},"2969":{"dur":5,"text":"After kids have been exposed to trauma, using\nthis kind of reappraisal could actually prevent"},"2975":{"dur":2,"text":"the onset of mental health problems later."},"2977":{"dur":1,"text":"And we don't know if this is true."},"2978":{"dur":1,"text":"This is entirely speculation on my point."},"2980":{"dur":4,"text":"But just something I think could be an important\nfuture direction."},"2984":{"dur":3,"text":"But something that's not speculation, a second\nexample."},"2988":{"dur":4,"text":"This is actually also a study from Allyson\nMackey's lab, where they use neuroscience,"},"2993":{"dur":5,"text":"and what we've learned about the neuroscience\nof poverty in particular, to think about delivering"},"2998":{"dur":4,"text":"and developing very brief interventions for\nkids growing up in poverty to try to boost"},"3003":{"dur":5,"text":"some of these complex cognitive skills that\nwe know are impacted by these atypical patterns"},"3008":{"dur":1,"text":"of brain development."},"3009":{"dur":3,"text":"So in this study, it was a very brief intervention."},"3013":{"dur":3,"text":"Kids came to an after school program twice\na week for eight weeks."},"3017":{"dur":3,"text":"And they worked with, basically, a graduate\nstudent who played games with them."},"3021":{"dur":1,"text":"But they were special kinds of games."},"3022":{"dur":5,"text":"They were games that were designed to specifically\ntarget certain kinds of cognitive processes."},"3028":{"dur":5,"text":"So some of the kids were trained in reasoning\nskills-- how to think critically about problems."},"3033":{"dur":4,"text":"And some of the kids played games that we're\nfocused on processing speed-- processing information"},"3038":{"dur":2,"text":"as quickly as you could-- to win."},"3040":{"dur":5,"text":"And what you saw just after eight weeks--\ntwice a week for eight weeks with a graduate"},"3045":{"dur":4,"text":"student-- is that the kids who were trained\nand reasoning improved significantly on a"},"3049":{"dur":1,"text":"standard test of reasoning ability."},"3051":{"dur":2,"text":"This is actually a test that's part of an\nIQ test."},"3053":{"dur":1,"text":"After eight weeks."},"3055":{"dur":5,"text":"Whereas kids who are trained in the processing\nspeed showed significant increases in their"},"3061":{"dur":3,"text":"ability to process complex information quickly."},"3064":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think that these findings suggest that\nbrief interventions, if they're targeting"},"3068":{"dur":5,"text":"the right cognitive and brain mechanisms,\ncan have really dramatic effects on

smaller."},"3206":{"dur":4,"text":"So, kind of, one of the ways to think about\nthis is that early in development, the brain"},"3211":{"dur":1,"text":"is incredibly plastic."},"3212":{"dur":2,"text":"And we retain that plasticity throughout our\nlives."},"3215":{"dur":4,"text":"We're constantly able to learn new things\nfrom the environment, and
