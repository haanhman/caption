just\nnot a very steep road"},"108":{"dur":3,"text":"because everything was brought\nup by horse and carriage"},"112":{"dur":3,"text":"So here's a photo from 1900."},"116":{"dur":3,"text":"In 1888, when the\nobservatory was completed,"},"119":{"dur":3,"text":"it was the world's first remote\nmountain top observatory."},"123":{"dur":1,"text":"Prior to that\ntime, observatories"},"124":{"dur":4,"text":"were on university campuses that\ntended to be in large cities"},"129":{"dur":1,"text":"at or near sea level."},"130":{"dur":2,"text":"But this was a\nvery remote place."},"133":{"dur":4,"text":"And it was arguably the birth\nof big science in the whole US,"},"137":{"dur":1,"text":"but certainly in the Western US."},"139":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was made possible\nby a generous donation"},"142":{"dur":1,"text":"from James Lick."},"144":{"dur":1,"text":"James Lick has a very\ninteresting history."},"146":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't have time to\ngo into most of it."},"147":{"dur":4,"text":"But suffice it to say that he\ncame to San Francisco, which"},"151":{"dur":4,"text":"was then Yerba Buena, at the\nbeginning of January, 1848,"},"156":{"dur":3,"text":"when it was a little shanty\ntown of perhaps 1,000 people."},"160":{"dur":2,"text":"He already had\nconsiderable wealth."},"163":{"dur":2,"text":"And he had the good\nfortune of arriving"},"165":{"dur":4,"text":"17 days before gold was\ndiscovered at Sutter's Mill."},"170":{"dur":3,"text":"He tried himself looking for\ngold for three or four days"},"174":{"dur":2,"text":"and then realized that this\nis just not the way to go."},"177":{"dur":2,"text":"He wants to deal\nwith real estate,"},"179":{"dur":2,"text":"but not with the\ndirt in his fingers."},"181":{"dur":3,"text":"So what he did is\nhe bought up land"},"185":{"dur":3,"text":"that people were selling in\norder to go and hunt for gold."},"188":{"dur":3,"text":"And then he sold it back to them\nafter they started coming back."},"192":{"dur":2,"text":"And of course, the Gold Rush\nbrought lots and lots of people"},"195":{"dur":1,"text":"into California."},"196":{"dur":2,"text":"So within three\nyears, San Francisco"},"198":{"dur":2,"text":"was a booming city\nof 20,000 or 30,000."},"201":{"dur":2,"text":"And Lick basically owned\na good fraction of it,"},"204":{"dur":3,"text":"as well as good fractions of the\nrest of California-- Catalina"},"207":{"dur":3,"text":"Island, parts of Napa\nValley, and places like that."},"211":{"dur":4,"text":"So he made a very large amount\nof money, very, very large."},"215":{"dur":1,"text":"Near the end of\nhis life, he wanted"},"217":{"dur":3,"text":"to use that money to\ncommemorate his parents,"},"220":{"dur":1,"text":"the memory of his parents."},"221":{"dur":3,"text":"And so he was thinking maybe\nof having statues erected"},"225":{"dur":2,"text":"of his parents on Ocean\nBeach facing the Pacific"},"228":{"dur":3,"text":"Ocean until it was pointed\nout to him that if we are ever"},"231":{"dur":2,"text":"attacked from the west, these\nwould be the first structures"},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"to come down, so that's\nnot such a good idea."},"236":{"dur":2,"text":"So then Lick thought,\nwell, how about a pyramid"},"239":{"dur":3,"text":"at the corner of Fourth and\nMarket Streets in San Francisco"},"243":{"dur":2,"text":"to commemorate himself\nand his parents?"},"245":{"dur":2,"text":"But you know, he was told that,\nlook, pyramids are no big deal."},"248":{"dur":1,"text":"There are pyramids in\nEgypt, Mexico, Central"},"250":{"dur":1,"text":"America, all over the place."},"251":{"dur":3,"text":"So why not do something\nreally useful and new?"},"255":{"dur":3,"text":"And a friend of his\nwas George Davidson,"},"258":{"dur":2,"text":"who was President of the\nCalifornia Academy of Sciences."},"261":{"dur":3,"text":"And he suggested that James\nLick build a telescope."},"264":{"dur":5,"text":"So in 1875, James\nLick donated $700,000"},"270":{"dur":2,"text":"to the building of\nthe world's greatest,"},"272":{"dur":2,"text":"most powerful telescope."},"274":{"dur":2,"text":"And as a fraction\nof the GDP, that's"},"277":{"dur":5,"text":"equivalent to about $1.2 billion\ntoday, the largest gift ever,"},"282":{"dur":1,"text":"certainly, in the\nphysical sciences."},"284":{"dur":1,"text":"So it was amazing."},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"And a 36-inch\nrefractor was built."},"288":{"dur":3,"text":"And James Lick is\nburied at its base"},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"down underneath the floor there."},"294":{"dur":1,"text":"And there you can\nsee the

days?"},"305":{"dur":1,"text":"But what I want\nto show you today"},"306":{"dur":3,"text":"is that it is doing cutting\nedge research, technology"},"310":{"dur":3,"text":"development, student\ntraining, and public outreach."},"313":{"dur":3,"text":"And for all these reasons, it's\nreally an incredible place."},"317":{"dur":3,"text":"And we don't just have the\n1888 great refractor anymore."},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"We have other telescopes that\nhave been built since then,"},"324":{"dur":3,"text":"the most recent of which\nis now only two years old,"},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"the Automated Planet Finder."},"329":{"dur":3,"text":"All of these telescopes are\nsmall by today's standards."},"333":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm privileged to be a\nuser of the mighty

very\nfaint, distant, exploding stars"},"343":{"dur":1,"text":"and galaxies."},"344":{"dur":1,"text":"But the time is\nso precious and it"},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"is needed by so many\nastronomers that you just"},"348":{"dur":1,"text":"can't do certain\ntypes of projects"},"350":{"dur":1,"text":"that I'll be describing here."},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"We're planning to build\na 30-meter

recently."},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"But hopefully, the 30-meter\ntelescope will be built."},"362":{"dur":1,"text":"And that will be fantastic, too."},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"We'll use it to study the\nfaintest, most distant objects"},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"But time will be\nvery, very precious--"},"370":{"dur":4,"text":"for UC astronomers, maybe\n40 nights a year in

Kecks."},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"But you can do them\nwith smaller telescopes,"},"381":{"dur":3,"text":"like at Lick, to which\nyou have repeated access."},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's what I want to\ndescribe to you today."},"387":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll start with supernovae."},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"I have always liked\nthings that blow up,"},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"as long as they're\nused safely and stuff."},"394":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, I'm not some\nterrorist or something."},"396":{"dur":3,"text":"But our sun will not blow\nup at the end of its life."},"399":{"dur":3,"text":"It will die a\nrelatively slow death."},"402":{"dur":3,"text":"It'll become brighter than\nit is now, But in a slow way."},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"But some stars become\nmuch, much brighter very,"},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"very quickly because\nthey literally explode."},"410":{"dur":3,"text":"This is a titanic,\ncolossal explosion"},"414":{"dur":3,"text":"that can make the star\nup to several billion"},"417":{"dur":4,"text":"times the brightness of\nour sun, or the luminosity,"},"421":{"dur":0,"text":"the true power."},"422":{"dur":3,"text":"So here is one star in this\ngalaxy of 100 billion stars."},"425":{"dur":3,"text":"And at its peak, it's about as\nbright as the central billion"},"429":{"dur":1,"text":"stars in this galaxy."},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"So if our sun were to do\nthis-- and don't worry,"},"433":{"dur":3,"text":"it won't-- then sun block of\n50 just wouldn't cut it, folks."},"436":{"dur":2,"text":"You'd need sun block,\nor supernova block,"},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"of a few billion to\nprotect yourself."},"440":{"dur":4,"text":"But don't worry, be happy-- our\nsun is not going to do this."},"445":{"dur":3,"text":"When stars do do this, they're\nnot only exciting to watch,"},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"but they are of fundamental\nimportance to us,"},"451":{"dur":3,"text":"because they generate\nand spew out into space"},"454":{"dur":3,"text":"the heavy elements that are so\nnecessary for life on Earth."},"457":{"dur":3,"text":"So during the normal nuclear\nreactions in a star, carbon"},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"and oxygen are built up\neventually-- right now"},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"our sun is forming\nhelium-- but those elements"},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"have no way to get out."},"467":{"dur":3,"text":"The supernova releases them\nand, during the explosion,"},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"creates additional\nheavy elements."},"473":{"dur":3,"text":"And we can look at supernova\nremnants, like this one,"},"476":{"dur":3,"text":"and see that the gases are\nenriched in heavy elements that"},"480":{"dur":3,"text":"simply weren't there in\nany significant abundance"},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"at the time the star was born."},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"The supernova remnants\nspread out like this"},"488":{"dur":1,"text":"and then meet up with\nother clouds of gas,"},"490":{"dur":3,"text":"eventually forming giant,\ngravitationally-bound clouds,"},"493":{"dur":3,"text":"like the Orion Nebula, in\nthe center of which you"},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"can see lots of newly-formed,\nor in some cases"},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"still-forming, stars."},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"And because this gas has gone\nthrough many, many generations"},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"of stellar birth and death\nand chemical enrichment,"},"509":{"dur":1,"text":"these gases are\nnow significantly"},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"enriched in heavy elements."},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"And so you can get\ngas and dust disks"},"516":{"dur":3,"text":"around newly-formed stars,\nwhich then coagulate"},"519":{"dur":4,"text":"into planets, some of which will\nbe rocky, Earth-like planets."},"524":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is how our\nown solar system"},"526":{"dur":3,"text":"was born 4 and 1\/2 billion\nyears ago from gases"},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"that had gone through many,\nmany generations of enrichment"},"533":{"dur":1,"text":"of this sort."},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"And somehow, somewhere-- I'll\nleave this to the biologists--"},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"lifeforms--

hidden."},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"But there's part of my DNA."},"546":{"dur":4,"text":"It ends up with people who are\nsentient beings that can sit"},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"and look out into the cosmos."},"553":{"dur":4,"text":"And my kids just attended the\nMaker's Faire a short time ago"},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"and were particularly\nthrilled by the Google booth,"},"559":{"dur":1,"text":"where they made\nrockets and stuff."},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"So they're going to sign up\nfor a Maker's Camp this summer."},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"So anyway, we are\nmade of star stuff."},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"So we would like to\nunderstand the process"},"568":{"dur":1,"text":"by which this occurs."},"570":{"dur":1,"text":"So we'd like to find\nnearby supernovae,"},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"but they're pretty rare."},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you look at\nsome galaxies, you're"},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"unlikely to find supernovae,\nbecause they only go off"},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"once every 30 or 40 years."},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"And that would be pretty boring\nlooking through a telescope"},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"in search of supernovae by eye."},"584":{"dur":1,"text":"Fortunately, with\nmodern technology,"},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"we have a better technique."},"587":{"dur":3,"text":"You attach CCD cameras to the\neyepiece end of a telescope,"},"590":{"dur":1,"text":"take photographs of\nthousands of galaxies,"},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"and simply look for arrows."},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"And where you see arrows,\nyou see exploding stars."},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"You see it happened once,\ntwice, three times, four times,"},"598":{"dur":0,"text":"five times."},"599":{"dur":1,"text":"By rigorous\nmathematical induction,"},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"I conclude that this\nprocess works every time."},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, it doesn't."},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"You have to program\ntelescopes and computers"},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"to do this and software that\nwill look for the new objects."},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"And so what we have\nat Lick Observatory"},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"is a telescope\nthat's by no means"},"616":{"dur":1,"text":"large by today's standards."},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"It's only 3\/4 of a\nmeter in diameter."},"620":{"dur":1,"text":"But it's been\nprogrammed expertly"},"622":{"dur":3,"text":"by my associate Weidong\nLi to look at, literally,"},"625":{"dur":3,"text":"thousands of galaxies each week\nand to compare the new pictures"},"629":{"dur":1,"text":"with the old pictures."},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"And usually, there is nothing\nnew in the new picture."},"632":{"dur":3,"text":"But occasionally, you'll notice\nsomething new, this star here."},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, the arrow is new, too."},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"But that was put in with\nPhotoshop or something."},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"So there is a\nthing that might be"},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"a supernova candidate-- or,\nit is a supernova candidate."},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"It might be a supernova."},"645":{"dur":1,"text":"But it could be something else."},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"It could be an asteroid flying\nthrough the field of view,"},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"perhaps with Earth's\nname written on it."},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"Someday, astronomers\nwill save humanity"},"653":{"dur":1,"text":"because they'll\nfind the asteroids"},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"and then applied physicists\nand engineers will figure out"},"657":{"dur":1,"text":"how to deflect them."},"659":{"dur":3,"text":"But anyway, one person's garbage\nis another person's gold."},"662":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't want the asteroids."},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't want the cosmic rays,\nwhich are charged particles"},"666":{"dur":1,"text":"that interact with the CCD."},"667":{"dur":1,"text":"I want the supernovae."},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"So out of a couple of dozen\ncandidates each night,"},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"maybe one of them will be\na supernova, maybe none."},"674":{"dur":3,"text":"And there, I used students who,\nwith their superb eye-brain"},"677":{"dur":1,"text":"combination, look\nat the candidates"},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"and determine which ones are\nlikely to be genuine supernovae"},"682":{"dur":1,"text":"worthy of further study."},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"And these students,\noften starting"},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"in their freshman year,\neven, get so excited

telescopes"},"727":{"dur":1,"text":"does you no good whatsoever."},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"You need huge amounts of\ntime, months or years,"},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"on small or\nmodest-sized telescopes."},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"Once we or others--\nI'm not saying we're"},"736":{"dur":1,"text":"the only ones who\nfind supernovae--"},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"but once we or others\nfind a supernova,"},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"we'd like to study\nthat supernova."},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"We collect more light\nwith a bigger telescope,"},"744":{"dur":1,"text":"like the 3-meter\ntelescope at Lick."},"746":{"dur":3,"text":"And then we're able to spread\nthe light out into a spectrum,"},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"plot the intensity\nversus the wavelength."},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"And when you do this\nfor enough supernovae,"},"753":{"dur":3,"text":"you find that they come in\nseveral well-defined groups--"},"757":{"dur":3,"text":"the Type I's that don't have\nhydrogen and the Type II's that"},"760":{"dur":0,"text":"do."},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"But here, you can see calcium,\noxygen, silicon, sulfur, iron,"},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"magnesium, the elements\nthat were generated"},"767":{"dur":4,"text":"during the star's life and\nduring its explosion, elements"},"772":{"dur":2,"text":"that are necessary for\nEarth and for life on Earth."},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"So there are other\ntypes, as well."},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"But we study them\nin some detail."},"779":{"dur":3,"text":"And getting one\nspectrum isn't enough,"},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"because you're\nthen just sampling"},"785":{"dur":3,"text":"the chemical elements that\nare on the outside parts"},"788":{"dur":1,"text":"of the star."},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"But as the exploding\nstar expands,"},"792":{"dur":3,"text":"the gases thin out and\nbecome transparent."},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"And you see down into\ndeeper and deeper layers."},"798":{"dur":3,"text":"So by getting a series\nof spectra over time--"},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"from 12 days before peak\nbrightness, in this case,"},"804":{"dur":2,"text":"to several months\nafter peak brightness--"},"807":{"dur":3,"text":"you can get, essentially, a CAT\nscan of this exploding star,"},"810":{"dur":3,"text":"because you see the\ndifferent layers up"},"814":{"dur":3,"text":"to where it's transparent down\nto where it becomes opaque."},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"And that boundary moves\nfarther and farther in."},"820":{"dur":3,"text":"So at early times, you see\nthings like calcium
