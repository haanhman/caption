right,"},"166":{"dur":1,"text":"how much is equal to each."},"168":{"dur":1,"text":"So Joe, I'll start with you."},"169":{"dur":2,"text":"If you think about that\npie, how much is

trick."},"178":{"dur":1,"text":"- I'll answer two ways."},"179":{"dur":2,"text":"If it's an indirect\nsales organization,"},"181":{"dur":1,"text":"which I have a big piece of it,"},"183":{"dur":3,"text":"I would say it's 30%\ntalent, 70% conditions."},"187":{"dur":3,"text":"Direct sales organization,\nI'd say it's 50-50."},"191":{"dur":3,"text":"50% talent, 50%\nperformance conditions."},"194":{"dur":3,"text":"- So I'm gonna go in reverse\norder and have you talk to me"},"197":{"dur":2,"text":"about the 50-50 and\ngive us an explanation"},"200":{"dur":1,"text":"and then I'd like\nto hear from Chris."},"202":{"dur":1,"text":"So explain your math."},"203":{"dur":2,"text":"- So 50-50, I think that\ntalent, when you're dealing"},"205":{"dur":2,"text":"directly with the customer,\nyou can influence a sale"},"208":{"dur":1,"text":"a lot more."},"210":{"dur":1,"text":"And typically, you're\nresponsible for more"},"212":{"dur":1,"text":"of the lead\ngeneration piece of it"},"213":{"dur":2,"text":"in a direct sales organization"},"215":{"dur":2,"text":"versus an indirect\nsales organization."},"217":{"dur":3,"text":"So an indirect sales\nprofessional in my organization"},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"has a group of partners\nthat they oversee typically."},"223":{"dur":2,"text":"Those partners bring\na value, and so talent"},"226":{"dur":2,"text":"is mitigated a little\nbit by the partner"},"229":{"dur":2,"text":"and also in performance."},"231":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a little bit on the\nstronger side because leads"},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"are provided by the\ncompany to the partner."},"237":{"dur":2,"text":"The partner executes on it\nand then the sales talent"},"239":{"dur":2,"text":"typically educates,\nhelps close the business."},"242":{"dur":2,"text":"But little further\nremoved from the customer."},"244":{"dur":1,"text":"- Okay, all right."},"246":{"dur":2,"text":"So Chris, let's stick\non the whole topic"},"248":{"dur":2,"text":"of the direct organization."},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"You've got the pie, how\nmuch goes to talent,"},"253":{"dur":1,"text":"how much performance conditions?"},"255":{"dur":1,"text":"- Clearly, they're both\ncritically important,"},"257":{"dur":2,"text":"but I give 51% to talent\nbecause there's no substitute"},"259":{"dur":1,"text":"for talent."},"261":{"dur":1,"text":"Anybody who has\nworked with people"},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"that are amazingly talented\nknows that's the difference."},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"Those who have worked with\npeople who they keep trying"},"267":{"dur":2,"text":"to make talented but can't,\nknows that's the difference."},"269":{"dur":2,"text":"The 49% that you're\ntalking about"},"272":{"dur":3,"text":"in terms of environmental,\nthat's about scale."},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"And so the beauty of\nthat 49% is you get a lot"},"277":{"dur":2,"text":"of scalability out of creating\nan optimal environment"},"279":{"dur":2,"text":"for highly talented\npeople to perform."},"281":{"dur":4,"text":"- So in your opinion,\ndoes the 49%,"},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"the performance conditions,\nyou're talking about scale,"},"288":{"dur":1,"text":"does that move the middle?"},"289":{"dur":2,"text":"So the best you're going\nto do what they're gonna do"},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"because they're just\nthe elite, the top 20?"},"294":{"dur":2,"text":"Performance conditions\nis your opinion that,"},"296":{"dur":2,"text":"that's what moves the middle\nand allows average people"},"299":{"dur":1,"text":"to generate above\naverage results."},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"- Absolutely, that's\nwhy I put it at 49%."},"303":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, I would take talent\nto 125% if you can get there,"},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"but raw talent is\nnot enough alone."},"309":{"dur":1,"text":"You've got to create\nan environment,"},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"and raising the lowest\ncommon denominator"},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"is worth a lot in\nhitting sales results."},"316":{"dur":3,"text":"- So John, you've executed\na couple of transformations"},"320":{"dur":1,"text":"in different companies."},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"Talent versus\nperformance conditions,"},"324":{"dur":3,"text":"does the industry matter\nin terms of how that math"},"328":{"dur":1,"text":"gets equated?"},"330":{"dur":3,"text":"- You know, I'm not\nsure that the industry"},"333":{"dur":1,"text":"is the biggest driver."},"334":{"dur":3,"text":"I do think 50-50\nwould be my answer."},"338":{"dur":3,"text":"And it does need to be\nlooked at in a balanced way."},"342":{"dur":4,"text":"But industry, I'm not sure"},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"is the key determinant."},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"I think it's having\nbalance and focus"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"on both simultaneously."},"353":{"dur":3,"text":"- So if the 50-50, 51-49,"},"357":{"dur":2,"text":"so I guess, John,\nquestion to you would be"},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"has it changed, meaning the\ntalent that you are looking for"},"363":{"dur":1,"text":"to bring in to say all right,"},"365":{"dur":2,"text":"this is the piece of\nhuman capital that I know"},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"if deployed in so-so\nperformance conditions, great;"},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"or subpar is gonna generate\nabove average results."},"373":{"dur":4,"text":"- Yeah, so talent,\nclearly, in any condition"},"378":{"dur":1,"text":"will outperform,"},"380":{"dur":3,"text":"superior talent will always\noutperform inferior talent."},"384":{"dur":4,"text":"But if you have the\nright performance metrics"},"388":{"dur":2,"text":"and capabilities\nand infrastructure,"},"391":{"dur":4,"text":"you can take a level of all\nperformance simultaneously,"},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"which is why you really\nneed to be doing both."},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"- Okay, well, we're\ngonna switch sides,"},"400":{"dur":3,"text":"and my friend, Mike, I'll\nask you the same question."},"403":{"dur":3,"text":"We have a strong sentiment\nfrom my friends on the right"},"406":{"dur":1,"text":"that talent wins."},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"So give us your feedback."},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"- Well, I mean, I guess I\ndidn't hear talent wins."},"412":{"dur":1,"text":"I heard it was 50-50."},"414":{"dur":1,"text":"And in the interest to taking\na strong point of view,"},"416":{"dur":3,"text":"I would bias in favor of\nperformance conditions."},"419":{"dur":1,"text":"Why do I say that?"},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, let's assume that you're\ntaking over an organization"},"423":{"dur":1,"text":"or coming into\none sort of fresh."},"425":{"dur":3,"text":"You've not been there for\nfour, five, six years."},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"When you get that initial\nlook, if you bias yourself"},"431":{"dur":1,"text":"towards the talent,\nyou're gonna start,"},"432":{"dur":2,"text":"first of all, you're gonna have\na hard time tracking people."},"434":{"dur":1,"text":"You're gonna have a hard\ntime convincing them"},"435":{"dur":1,"text":"to join a broken organization."},"437":{"dur":1,"text":"And if you do, it'll cost you"},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"more than you're\ngonna wanna pay."},"441":{"dur":1,"text":"And secondly, even if\nyou do bring them in,"},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"they're gonna become frustrated\nrelatively easily because"},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"they're not gonna be able\nto do what they've done"},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"in previous corporations\nbecause they have obstacles"},"448":{"dur":1,"text":"you haven't removed yet.\n- [Voiceover] Yep."},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"- And lastly, even\nthose employees that do,"},"453":{"dur":3,"text":"you are able to recruit and\ndo come in and persevere,"},"456":{"dur":1,"text":"they're gonna end\ncreating their own"},"458":{"dur":3,"text":"local performance conditions\nthat are not representative"},"461":{"dur":1,"text":"of the whole company\nbecause they have to create"},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"some way of excellence\ninside and then you end up"},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"with multiple different\ncompanies inside of a company,"},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"because everybody's brought\nwith them the things"},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"they used to do in the past."},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"So yes, talent is\nimportant obviously,"},"474":{"dur":1,"text":"but if you're going to look,"},"476":{"dur":1,"text":"take a two or\nthree-year roadmap view,"},"478":{"dur":1,"text":"you're gonna want to get your\nperformance conditions set"},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"as you assess your talent."},"481":{"dur":1,"text":"And then after\nyou've assessed it,"},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"then maybe you\nstart to make moves."},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"But you're gonna wanna have\nthose performance conditions"},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"as part of the selling\npackage to attract the talent"},"488":{"dur":0,"text":"to come in."},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"- Okay, so let's stay on that."},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"So Aaron, I think\nto Mike's point,"},"493":{"dur":3,"text":"the guys I heard some\nwaiting to talent,"},"496":{"dur":1,"text":"as I think Chris\narticulated a while,"},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"we said the 120%."},"499":{"dur":3,"text":"So you're arguing obviously\nthe same side to Mike"},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"around performance conditions,"},"504":{"dur":1,"text":"so give us your\nfeedback around that."},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yeah, so I'm gonna have\nto go with Mike on this one"},"508":{"dur":1,"text":"and go with\nperformance conditions,"},"509":{"dur":1,"text":"and I'm gonna come\nto that determination"},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"by looking at two extremes."},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"On one extreme, you've got the\nideal performance conditions,"},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"so you've got a great product,\nit solves market problems."},"519":{"dur":3,"text":"You've got buyers with financial\nmeans to buy that product."},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"They're gonna find a\nway to actually transact"},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"and purchase that product."},"526":{"dur":5,"text":"On the flipside, then so irregardless of the talent there,"},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"on the flipside, let's\nsay that you have"},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"the worst performance\nconditions."},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"So you have a product\nthat does not solve"},"538":{"dur":1,"text":"any market problems,\nyou have buyers"},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"with no financial means,\nyou may have the greatest"},"542":{"dur":1,"text":"sales rep in the world\nbut he's not gonna be able"},"543":{"dur":1,"text":"to sell something that\ndoesn't solve a market problem"},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"when there's no financial\nmeans to transact."},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"So therefore, I'm gonna lean"},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"toward the performance\nconditions."},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"- Okay, so we have\nthree gentlemen"},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"and three completely\ndifferent industries,"},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"telecommunications, financial\nservices, truck leasing."},"561":{"dur":2,"text":"So when you think\nabout that, you guys,"},"563":{"dur":4,"text":"so Chris, I'll go to you and\nyou hear Aaron's point of view,"},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"is it impossible to\ndeliver on the number"},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"when all you have is great\nperformance conditions"},"574":{"dur":3,"text":"because you just have this infrastructure that is so strong,"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"it's almost like internal\nhigh tides raising all ships."},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"Or have you been a\npart of that, perhaps?"},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"- Well, if you can\ncreate this optimal"},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"performance environment,\nit's possible,"},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"but it's very hard to create."},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's where I take\nissue with the comment is"},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"if you can really create\na robotic environment,"},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"which is my interpretation\nof that statement,"},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"then yeah, it's doable."},"593":{"dur":1,"text":"But I think the world\ndoesn't work that way."},"595":{"dur":1,"text":"There's too many external\nfactors you don't control."},"596":{"dur":3,"text":"What you can control is\nthe quality of your talent,"},"599":{"dur":1,"text":"both in your recruitment process"},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"and in your learning\nand development process."},"602":{"dur":1,"text":"And that takes th\ngame to another level."},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"Now I'm not saying\nas earlier 49%,"},"607":{"dur":3,"text":"because creating an ecosystem\nthat is highly productive"},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"can make a huge\ndifference, but I would say"},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"if I was going to\nerr on one side,"},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"I would really wanna\nselect my talent because"},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"when the circumstances\nand conditions get poor,"},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"guess who's gonna figure out\nhow to get out of the subway"},"620":{"dur":0,"text":"in the dark?"},"621":{"dur":1,"text":"Talent people."},"622":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughter)"},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"- So in the spirit of\nbeing in the dark, Joe,"},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"we know that it's\nlike to fight uphill."},"629":{"dur":4,"text":"So opinion of, you talked\nabout direct and indirect."},"633":{"dur":3,"text":"You've seen high-performing\nindividuals be in tough spots,"},"637":{"dur":5,"text":"so I guess point of view on\nhow you maintain great talent"},"642":{"dur":3,"text":"when you don't have great\nperformance conditions."},"645":{"dur":1,"text":"Why does an A player want to\nstay inside a C organization"},"646":{"dur":1,"text":"or what's around them?"},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"- Well, I think these guys\ncopied my answer first of all."},"650":{"dur":3,"text":"(laughter)"},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"- They're only human."},"655":{"dur":1,"text":"- Well, I look at it this way."},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, if you have\na C talented person,"},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"if we categorize it A, B\nand C in an environment"},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"that's doing 75% a quarter,"},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"I think an A talented person\nin that exact same environment"},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"would do 115% of quota."},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"So you're moving the needle\njust based on talent."},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"Now let's say you're\nin an environment"},"673":{"dur":1,"text":"where the conditions\naren't good."},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"Market's not good,\nthere's no state and local"},"677":{"dur":1,"text":"government business to be had."},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"A talented person can\nstill outdrive a person"},"682":{"dur":1,"text":"with lesser talent\nsignificantly."},"684":{"dur":3,"text":"Now whether or not their\nperformance is acceptable or not"},"687":{"dur":3,"text":"is to be debated, but you can\ndefinitely move the needle"},"691":{"dur":1,"text":"with talent."},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"To keep people motivated\nin an environment"},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"where you don't have\ngood conditions,"},"695":{"dur":1,"text":"product's not working well,"},"697":{"dur":4,"text":"there's not a good economy\nin that particular market,"},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"maybe it's really\nheavy education"},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"and you don't have a\ngood education story,"},"705":{"dur":3,"text":"a talented person will\nstill stay if they feel like"},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"that they're motivated and inspired and they have leadership"},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"that's backing them,\nhelping drive leads,"},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"helping create an environment\nthat can be successful."},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"But if they don't feel like\nanybody has their back,"},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"they feel like they've been\norphaned in that environment,"},"720":{"dur":2,"text":"then they're really gonna have\na problem being successful."},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"You don't want to take an A\ntalented person and set them up"},"724":{"dur":1,"text":"for failure."},"726":{"dur":3,"text":"- So John, to Joe's point about\ntaking an A talented person,"},"730":{"dur":3,"text":"set him up for failure, you\nwalk into an organization,"},"733":{"dur":3,"text":"do you actually hold off\non bringing in A talent"},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"until you have performance\nconditions and ecosystem"},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"that says, you know what,\nI can actually sustain"},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"a first-round draft pick, right?"},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yeah, the answer is yes."},"746":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think the first thing\nyou do, and Joe hit it,"},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"is look internally for\nthe A talented people"},"753":{"dur":4,"text":"that you can basically\nempower to reach further"},"758":{"dur":4,"text":"than they may have otherwise\nthrough territory optimization,"},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"compensation plans, et cetera,"},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"and wait for the appropriate\ntiming to bring in"},"768":{"dur":2,"text":"external talent."},"770":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can wait,"},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"critical that you take\nadvantage of the talent"},"775":{"dur":1,"text":"that you have in the\nfield as you take over"},"776":{"dur":1,"text":"an organization."},"778":{"dur":2,"text":"- So Aaron, agree or\ndisagree with John's point"},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"around optimization of\nperformance conditions"},"783":{"dur":3,"text":"while you get the infrastructure\nready to bring in A talent"},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"and you still gotta make\nthe quarterly numbers."},"789":{"dur":0,"text":"So is that the right approach?"},"790":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, agree 100%."},"791":{"dur":1,"text":"But think about talent\nfrom the top down"},"793":{"dur":1,"text":"and that sort of situation."},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"You need somebody to help create"},"796":{"dur":1,"text":"those performance conditions,\nso you've gotta have"},"798":{"dur":1,"text":"some A player talent on\nthe team in order to create"},"799":{"dur":1,"text":"performance conditions\nthat then can be scaled"},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"and rolled out to the\nrest of the organization."},"804":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Matt] Okay, all\nright, very good."},"805":{"dur":1,"text":"Mike?"},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yeah, one thing, at the\nrisk of agreeing with John..."},"810":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughter)"},"811":{"dur":1,"text":"- First time."},"812":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, there's a first\ntime for everything."},"813":{"dur":1,"text":"So one thing that\njumped out at me is that"},"815":{"dur":1,"text":"when you're doing this\nassessment of your talent"},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"and if you're a new leader\nto the organization,"},"819":{"dur":1,"text":"you're kind of trying\nto do your best to see"},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"who's got trapped potential,"},"823":{"dur":2,"text":"one way to do that is an\nentrepreneurial contest."},"826":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't know if anyone's ever\nhad experience with that,"},"827":{"dur":2,"text":"but that's where you have\na couple of problems."},"829":{"dur":1,"text":"Even early on, you're gonna know"},"831":{"dur":1,"text":"maybe some of your problems,\nyou've done some basic"},"832":{"dur":1,"text":"root cause analysis\nand you say okay,"},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"tell me how we solve this,\nand you push that out"},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"to the field at a managerial\nlevel or director level"},"839":{"dur":2,"text":"and you say give\nme some answers."},"841":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's an alternative,\nin some cases,"},"843":{"dur":2,"text":"to hiring someone in\nto come in and tell you"},"845":{"dur":1,"text":"what the answer is,\nand you see by that,"},"847":{"dur":2,"text":"it's ironic, it's a way

sitting\non that side of the room"},"866":{"dur":1,"text":"and I heard that\nanswer, I might say"},"868":{"dur":3,"text":"mmm, sounds squishy,\nsound a little academic."},"871":{"dur":2,"text":"But you know what, can someone\nplease go sell something?"},"874":{"dur":2,"text":"So Chris, thoughts\non Mike's comment"},"877":{"dur":1,"text":"on the entrepreneurial\nexperiment."},"878":{"dur":1,"text":"Does that work?"},"879":{"dur":2,"text":"- You're gonna be shocked\nby this, but I love it."},"882":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, sales and\nevolving as human beings,"},"884":{"dur":1,"text":"they're not mutually\nexclusive things."},"886":{"dur":1,"text":"That's what humans do."},"887":{"dur":1,"text":"So in my mind, it's liberating,"},"889":{"dur":1,"text":"and liberating is very\npowerful for people"},"890":{"dur":1,"text":"in an organization."},"892":{"dur":1,"text":"So I absolutely want to\nsee the creative

to make the number"},"906":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yup."},"908":{"dur":3,"text":"So I guess if we think\nabout trying to wrap a bow"},"911":{"dur":2,"text":"around a topic that\nis very difficult,"},"914":{"dur":1,"text":"you hear a couple of\ndifferent points of view,"},"916":{"dur":2,"text":"so John, I guess\nI'll come back to you"},"919":{"dur":2,"text":"as you think about\nwrapping this around."},"921":{"dur":2,"text":"For the sales leaders that\nare watching this and saying"},"924":{"dur":2,"text":"how do I go about this\nspecifically around talent?"},"927":{"dur":1,"text":"I've got pretty good\nperformance conditions,"},"928":{"dur":2,"text":"are there one or two things\nyou would leave them with"},"931":{"dur":2,"text":"to say, yeah, this is how\nyou have an organization"},"934":{"dur":2,"text":"that brings in A player talent."},"936":{"dur":2,"text":"- You start with the assessment."},"939":{"dur":3,"text":"You start with the assessment\nin terms of where you're at,"},"943":{"dur":3,"text":"at different levels\nand different roles."},"946":{"dur":3,"text":"And if you can get key\ntalent at leadership levels,"},"950":{"dur":3,"text":"they're going to bring\nin other capable leaders."},"953":{"dur":3,"text":"And if you don't, if you\nhave people that are afraid"},"956":{"dur":2,"text":"that the people working\nfor them may be better,"},"959":{"dur":1,"text":"you have a nonstarter."},"960":{"dur":4,"text":"So do the assessment and hire\ncapable leadership talent."},"965":{"dur":1,"text":"It starts with the foundation."},"966":{"dur":1,"text":"- Very good."},"968":{"dur":1,"text":"A topic we could talk\nabout for the next day,"},"970":{"dur":2,"text":"but we need to move\non to our next

gonna jump into\nour second topic,"},"1026":{"dur":2,"text":"which for many of the sales\nleaders that are watching this"},"1028":{"dur":2,"text":"right now would be near\nand dear to your heart,"},"1031":{"dur":1,"text":"which is the concept of leads."},"1032":{"dur":3,"text":"I think it was the Academy award-winning Glengarry Glen Ross"},"1036":{"dur":3,"text":"and the comment that\nthe leads are weak,"},"1039":{"dur":1,"text":"well, we're gonna\nhear from some folks"},"1040":{"dur":1,"text":"who have some opinions."},"1042":{"dur":3,"text":"So the topic is sales and\nsales generating leads."},"1045":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm gonna start with Chris."},"1048":{"dur":3,"text":"Chris, this whole back and\nforth between a salesperson"},"1051":{"dur":2,"text":"saying who's responsible\nfor putting leads in my bag,"},"1054":{"dur":3,"text":"how much of a salesperson's\nlead should come from them?"},"1057":{"dur":3,"text":"And how should they do that\nin today's day and age?"},"1060":{"dur":2,"text":"- It's a real conundrum,\njust to start with."},"1063":{"dur":2,"text":"But I actually think\nthe most expensive lead"},"1065":{"dur":1,"text":"is a lead generated\nby a salesperson."},"1066":{"dur":1,"text":"What you want them\ndoing is working"},"1068":{"dur":2,"text":"through the pipeline,\nprocess through close."},"1071":{"dur":4,"text":"The ultimate organization is\none who can generate leads"},"1075":{"dur":1,"text":"that are well-qualified."},"1076":{"dur":2,"text":"And in today's world of\nfantastic lead gen programs,"},"1079":{"dur":2,"text":"demand generation,\nmarketing analytics,"},"1081":{"dur":2,"text":"I think you can really raise\nthe standard of amount of leads"},"1084":{"dur":2,"text":"that are fed, prequalified,\nto salespeople"},"1087":{"dur":2,"text":"who are a very expensive\nassets when they're out trying"},"1089":{"dur":1,"text":"to find something\nin the Yellow Pages."},"1091":{"dur":2,"text":"- Okay, so John,"},"1093":{"dur":3,"text":"today's day and age, everybody\ntipped over with technology"},"1096":{"dur":3,"text":"a few years ago and said\nlet's push, push, push"},"1099":{"dur":2,"text":"through email\nautomation and what not."},"1102":{"dur":1,"text":"What's your opinion on\nthe percentage of leads"},"1104":{"dur":1,"text":"and sales should generate?"},"1105":{"dur":2,"text":"- Well, I'd also work agree"},"1108":{"dur":3,"text":"a salesperson as\na lead generator"},"1112":{"dur":4,"text":"is a very expensive,\ninefficient resource."},"1116":{"dur":2,"text":"And so the lead should\ncome from other parts"},"1119":{"dur":2,"text":"of the organization\nas we talked about."},"1121":{"dur":2,"text":"Certainly, there's\nan opportunity now"},"1124":{"dur":4,"text":"with marketing automation\nand the wave of social"},"1128":{"dur":2,"text":"to do a lot more in that area."},"1131":{"dur":3,"text":"But absolutely, if you're\ndependent and reliant"},"1134":{"dur":2,"text":"on the sales\norganization to develop"},"1137":{"dur":4,"text":"most of the leads themselves,\nthat's not very efficient."},"1142":{"dur":4,"text":"- So Joe, you specifically\nhave a point of view on this,"},"1147":{"dur":2,"text":"with your background\nwith social."},"1149":{"dur":2,"text":"So I guess approach it\nfrom both the indirect side"},"1152":{"dur":1,"text":"and the direct side\nbecause you have both."},"1153":{"dur":1,"text":"Same question."},"1154":{"dur":2,"text":"- I'll give you numbers."},"1156":{"dur":3,"text":"On the indirect side, 20%\nshould come from the team,"},"1160":{"dur":4,"text":"30% should come from the\npartner if you're indirect,"},"1164":{"dur":2,"text":"and 50% should come\nfrom, in our case,"},"1166":{"dur":3,"text":"marketing organization or a\nlead generation organization"},"1170":{"dur":1,"text":"of something internally."},"1171":{"dur":2,"text":"I think part of what you\nhave as a salesperson"},"1173":{"dur":3,"text":"going into a\npartner-led community"},"1176":{"dur":1,"text":"is that's currency."},"1178":{"dur":1,"text":"So when you have a lead,\nyou can exchange that lead"},"1180":{"dur":3,"text":"for rapport, for value,\nmoney you bring to the table,"},"1183":{"dur":1,"text":"mind share."},"1184":{"dur":1,"text":"So that lead becomes currency."},"1186":{"dur":1,"text":"And if they're\ngenerating all the leads,"},"1187":{"dur":2,"text":"they perceive what's the value\ntruly that you're bringing"},"1190":{"dur":1,"text":"to the table."},"1192":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think it's important\nthat salespeople in general,"},"1194":{"dur":2,"text":"including the leadership,\nbring leads to the partners."},"1197":{"dur":2,"text":"Now in a direct world,\nI agree with them,"},"1199":{"dur":1,"text":"I think it's a little\nexpensive to have"},"1201":{"dur":2,"text":"your direct organization\ncreating leads."},"1203":{"dur":2,"text":"I do think sales\nhas to own it though"},"1205":{"dur":1,"text":"from cradle to grave\nbecause you don't want"},"1207":{"dur":2,"text":"the sales organization blaming\nthe marketing organization"},"1210":{"dur":1,"text":"on the quality of the leads."},"1211":{"dur":2,"text":"The leads stink, to use\nGlengarry Glen Ross,"},"1214":{"dur":4,"text":"then the sales people should\nhave part of the ownership"},"1219":{"dur":1,"text":"to have that."},"1220":{"dur":2,"text":"So whoever the leader\nis of the leads"},"1223":{"dur":2,"text":"needs to carry it\nfrom cradle to grave."},"1225":{"dur":3,"text":"- Okay, so I have a feeling\nthat this could get physical."},"1229":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughter)"},"1230":{"dur":3,"text":"So Aaron, the opinion of\nmy friends on the right"},"1234":{"dur":2,"text":"is that you don't want\nto spend too much time"},"1237":{"dur":2,"text":"with expensive salespeople\ngenerating leads."},"1239":{"dur":1,"text":"What's your point\nof view on that?"},"1241":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yep, so I will\nagree that sales"},"1243":{"dur":2,"text":"is a very expensive resource\nto be generating leads."},"1245":{"dur":2,"text":"However, I would counter\nthat with the first lead"},"1247":{"dur":2,"text":"that a salesperson generates\nis a very cheap lead."},"1250":{"dur":2,"text":"The second lead is a\nlittle bit more expensive."},"1252":{"dur":2,"text":"The hundredth lead is\nquite a bit more expensive."},"1254":{"dur":1,"text":"If you look at it on\nthe marketing side,"},"1256":{"dur":1,"text":"you've got a similar\nsort of dynamic there."},"1257":{"dur":2,"text":"The first lead the marketing\ngenerates is very cheap."},"1260":{"dur":2,"text":"The hundredth one is\nmuch more extensive."},"1262":{"dur":2,"text":"So you need to take a look\nat the sensitivity analysis"},"1265":{"dur":2,"text":"and where the crossover\npoint is between the cost"},"1267":{"dur":1,"text":"for sales to generate a lead"},"1268":{"dur":1,"text":"and marketing to\ngenerate a lead."},"1271":{"dur":3,"text":"- So Mike, how would you\ntake that down to the street."},"1274":{"dur":2,"text":"If I'm watching the show and\nI'm saying, you know what,"},"1277":{"dur":1,"text":"I am dealing with\nthat right now."},"1279":{"dur":2,"text":"This is me, this is marketing,\nwe're having a battle,"},"1282":{"dur":1,"text":"and I gotta make the number."},"1283":{"dur":1,"text":"- Right."},"1284":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, I was almost\ngonna walk off a sec"},"1286":{"dur":1,"text":"because I found myself\nagreeing with John and Chris,"},"1288":{"dur":1,"text":"and then Joe spoke up."},"1290":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughter)"},"1291":{"dur":1,"text":"So I have something\nwith which to disagree."},"1293":{"dur":1,"text":"So I think one\nthing that escaped"},"1294":{"dur":2,"text":"my esteemed colleagues'\nanswers was a differentiation"},"1297":{"dur":3,"text":"between leads for new customers\nthat you haven't acquired"},"1301":{"dur":1,"text":"and leads for\nexisting customers."},"1302":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think the response\nwas quite different."},"1304":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, in a new\nlogo acquisition,"},"1306":{"dur":1,"text":"marketing has to take the lead."},"1307":{"dur":3,"text":"Now a sales individual might\nsort of stimulate demand"},"1310":{"dur":2,"text":"or they know somebody,\nbut the nurturing process,"},"1313":{"dur":1,"text":"especially for a complex sale,"},"1314":{"dur":2,"text":"however the product or solution\nis, is too long in time"},"1317":{"dur":2,"text":"and is too sort of stochastic."},"1320":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not a sales rep."},"1321":{"dur":1,"text":"Sales rep needs coin-operated,\ndriven activities."},"1322":{"dur":1,"text":"They can be managed."},"1324":{"dur":2,"text":"Sales managers do not do a\ngood job managing lead activity"},"1326":{"dur":2,"text":"at all, and so you end up\nwhen sales has responsibility"},"1329":{"dur":2,"text":"for new logo generation,\nit's spotty at best"},"1332":{"dur":2,"text":"and it becomes an\norganizational irritant."},"1335":{"dur":4,"text":"So conversely, on the side\nof existing customers,"},"1339":{"dur":2,"text":"that the sales\nshould take the lead."},"1342":{"dur":1,"text":"They own the relationships,\nand marketing should provide"},"1343":{"dur":1,"text":"a support role."},"1344":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's many\nthings that they can do"},"1345":{"dur":1,"text":"to stimulate and support\nand do brand awareness"},"1347":{"dur":2,"text":"within an account and maybe\nhelp further, get wider"},"1350":{"dur":2,"text":"in an account, maybe\ngo international."},"1352":{"dur":2,"text":"But the sale should own\nthat customer over time."},"1355":{"dur":2,"text":"- So Joe, I guess I\nwould come back to you."},"1357":{"dur":3,"text":"So I believe that who you\nknow is more important"},"1361":{"dur":1,"text":"than what you know."},"1363":{"dur":1,"text":"And in today's day and\nage, people have said that"},"1364":{"dur":2,"text":"you know what, email\nis a clogged channel."},"1367":{"dur":2,"text":"And having access, think about\nthe people calling you guys"},"1370":{"dur":3,"text":"every single day trying to\nsell you something, right?"},"1374":{"dur":1,"text":"They can't get in."},"1375":{"dur":1,"text":"But if they happen, you\nknow, I'm fortunate enough"},"1377":{"dur":1,"text":"to know the three of you."},"1379":{"dur":1,"text":"If they happen to know\nme or Mike or Aaron,"},"1380":{"dur":1,"text":"we could provide an\nintroduction and you could be"},"1382":{"dur":2,"text":"this anchor account\nfor somebody."},"1384":{"dur":3,"text":"So speak a little bit about\nthat because in my opinion,"},"1387":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that sales should\ntake a very, very strong point"},"1390":{"dur":1,"text":"because they know\nwhat good looks like."},"1392":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, I agree."},"1393":{"dur":2,"text":"My major accounts team\nis high touch high feel,"},"1395":{"dur":2,"text":"but we fulfill\nthrough indirect means"},"1398":{"dur":3,"text":"but they are required to generate a percentage of the leads."},"1401":{"dur":2,"text":"Not all of them, but a nice\npercentage of the leads."},"1403":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, LinkedIn today\nis like the new caller ID."},"1406":{"dur":3,"text":"So when I get a call\nand it says unknown,"},"1409":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't answer the call."},"1411":{"dur":3,"text":"But if somebody sends me an\nemail and they drop a name"},"1415":{"dur":2,"text":"like yours or Aaron's,\nI'll give them the benefit"},"1417":{"dur":1,"text":"of the doubt, I'll check\nthem out on LinkedIn."},"1419":{"dur":3,"text":"If there's social relevance,\nagain, back to me in some way"},"1422":{"dur":2,"text":"that could benefit me\nor my organization,"},"1424":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll return the call."},"1426":{"dur":3,"text":"And so that's why it's really\nimportant that my sales team"},"1430":{"dur":3,"text":"have relevance and that they\nhave really strong networks"},"1433":{"dur":3,"text":"so that they can get to the\ndecision-maker at a company"},"1436":{"dur":2,"text":"in a lead gen\ncampaign, for example,"},"1439":{"dur":3,"text":"and be able to use\nrelationships with you at SBI"},"1442":{"dur":3,"text":"or with one of their partners\nor anybody that they've met"},"1445":{"dur":1,"text":"over 20 years of selling."},"1446":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think you do"},"1449":{"dur":2,"text":"have an ownership to generate\na piece of the leads,"},"1452":{"dur":2,"text":"again, using it as currency\nbecause you come now with value."},"1454":{"dur":2,"text":"- So I think if\nI'm watching this,"},"1457":{"dur":1,"text":"what I takeaway from this,"},"1459":{"dur":2,"text":"Joe's point of social\nrelevance and who you know"},"1461":{"dur":2,"text":"and the extension, LinkedIn\nnow is a great channel"},"1464":{"dur":2,"text":"to get that done, but also\nunderstanding the difference"},"1466":{"dur":3,"text":"between existing customers\nand new logo acquisition"},"1470":{"dur":3,"text":"and where to point your\nprecious resources of people,"},"1473":{"dur":1,"text":"money and time."},"1474":{"dur":2,"text":"So although we could\nkeep talking about that,"},"1476":{"dur":1,"text":"we're gonna keep moving\nand we're gonna go to"},"1478":{"dur":2,"text":"a really fun topic."},"1480":{"dur":1,"text":"I like to call this\nthe victory lap."},"1482":{"dur":3,"text":"So on my right, I have\nthree esteemed leaders"},"1486":{"dur":1,"text":"and they have all had big years"},"1487":{"dur":1,"text":"where they have\ncrushed the number."},"1489":{"dur":2,"text":"So John, I'm now going\nto start with you."},"1491":{"dur":3,"text":"You get to the end of the year\nand you blew the number away."},"1496":{"dur":2,"text":"The expectations\nchange with the CEO"},"1498":{"dur":1,"text":"and how do you manage\nthat internally?"},"1500":{"dur":1,"text":"Does that become the new normal?"},"1503":{"dur":0,"text":"- Yes,"},"1504":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughter)"},"1506":{"dur":2,"text":"you have to start thinking\nabout that well before"},"1508":{"dur":2,"text":"the end of the year."},"1512":{"dur":2,"text":"But yeah, it just is..."},"1515":{"dur":3,"text":"Shareholders are looking\nfor increased returns"},"1519":{"dur":3,"text":"and to the extent you\nbeat expectations,"},"1523":{"dur":3,"text":"the bar is set higher so\nthat's not unexpected."},"1526":{"dur":2,"text":"So in order to possibly\nget ahead of that"},"1529":{"dur":3,"text":"is making sure, first of\nall, you have a good idea."},"1533":{"dur":2,"text":"So that shouldn't\ncome as a surprise."},"1535":{"dur":4,"text":"You should know that at\nleast a quarter of advance,"},"1540":{"dur":4,"text":"and if they were unique\nconditions that set that up,"},"1545":{"dur":1,"text":"make sure you're aware of that."},"1547":{"dur":2,"text":"But certainly, you've\nnow crushed the number,"},"1549":{"dur":3,"text":"raised the bar and put yourself"},"1553":{"dur":2,"text":"in a good position"},"1555":{"dur":2,"text":"if you can carry the\nmomentum forward."},"1558":{"dur":2,"text":"- So Chris, you walk\ninto the board meeting,"},"1560":{"dur":2,"text":"you're literally wearing the\ncheckered flag around you"},"1563":{"dur":3,"text":"like a shawl, and the\ncompany is thrilled,"},"1566":{"dur":2,"text":"they're handing out stock\nlike candies at Halloween,"},"1569":{"dur":1,"text":"and you want to\ntemper expectations,"},"1571":{"dur":2,"text":"or do you point\nto and say listen,"},"1574":{"dur":2,"text":"we won this year because\nof these three big deals"},"1576":{"dur":1,"text":"or whatever happened."},"1578":{"dur":1,"text":"If you think back to the years\nwhen you've blown it out,"},"1579":{"dur":2,"text":"what were one or two\nof the things that said"},"1582":{"dur":2,"text":"that was the reason?"},"1584":{"dur":2,"text":"- Well, first of all, it's\na good damn problem to have."},"1587":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't want you to be\nin denial about that."},"1589":{"dur":3,"text":"Once you get your head around\nthat fact that you will"},"1592":{"dur":2,"text":"hopefully have already\nstarted a long time ago"},"1595":{"dur":2,"text":"working on the next\nyear's numbers,"},"1597":{"dur":3,"text":"you kind of get a sense of\nhow much expectations set"},"1600":{"dur":1,"text":"you have to do."},"1602":{"dur":3,"text":"And I've seen more\nsales heads get canned"},"1605":{"dur":2,"text":"on the back of exuberance\nthat they couldn't fulfill on"},"1607":{"dur":3,"text":"than those that set\nexpectations probably."},"1611":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'm not talking\nabout sandbagging."},"1612":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm talking about\nstrong explanation for"},"1615":{"dur":1,"text":"what drove the great\nsuccess of this year"},"1617":{"dur":2,"text":"and what it's gonna take\nnext year to do that?"},"1619":{"dur":1,"text":"There are some things\nthat are extraordinary"},"1621":{"dur":3,"text":"that are not duplicated, although you try to duplicate it."},"1624":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's a lot about setting\nexpectations, being transparent"},"1627":{"dur":2,"text":"and letting people\nknow, let them feel like"},"1630":{"dur":2,"text":"they're the head of\nsales at that time"},"1632":{"dur":2,"text":"and that they're taking on\nthe burden that you have."},"1634":{"dur":2,"text":"- So Mike, I'm gonna hear\nfrom you and I'm gonna go back"},"1636":{"dur":1,"text":"to Joe."},"1638":{"dur":3,"text":"When you've seen companies\nhave these blowout years,"},"1641":{"dur":4,"text":"what do you see the sales leader\ndo incorrectly after that,"},"1646":{"dur":3,"text":"that causes year two or\nthe next year to not go"},"1649":{"dur":1,"text":"as it should?"},"1650":{"dur":2,"text":"- So I think it boils\ndown to knowing why."},"1652":{"dur":1,"text":"I think what happens a lot\nof times is the numbers"},"1654":{"dur":1,"text":"start rolling in,\nthings look super good"},"1656":{"dur":3,"text":"and all those victory laps are\ntaken and that at some point"},"1659":{"dur":2,"text":"in time, the sales\nexecutive is not concerned"},"1661":{"dur":2,"text":"with actually why\ndid we do that well?"},"1664":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's easy to point to\nsort of a big deal here"},"1667":{"dur":2,"text":"and a great sales rep there\nand a wonderful client"},"1669":{"dur":2,"text":"in the other and then\nall adds up to nothing,"},"1671":{"dur":2,"text":"nothing discernible,\nnothing defensible."},"1674":{"dur":2,"text":"And so the very first thing\nthat I would recommend (mumbles)"},"1676":{"dur":1,"text":"to do is look at two elements."},"1678":{"dur":3,"text":"The first is how did the\nmarket space do overall?"},"1682":{"dur":2,"text":"How did your competitors do,\nyour near-term substitutes,"},"1684":{"dur":2,"text":"all the people that are\nsort of in your general"},"1687":{"dur":1,"text":"industry classification."},"1688":{"dur":2,"text":"If they went up 6%\nand you went up 4%,"},"1691":{"dur":2,"text":"that's actually a problem\neven if you trunk before"},"1693":{"dur":1,"text":"or whatever."},"1694":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's number one."},"1696":{"dur":2,"text":"Number two, I would look at\nyour very
