work"},"145":{"dur":2,"text":"at Harvey Mudd is work with Foothill AIDS Project."},"148":{"dur":1,"text":"And the stories that I'm gonna tell you tonight"},"150":{"dur":2,"text":"and what I've learned about HIV is as much what I've learned"},"153":{"dur":3,"text":"in the lab as what I've learned from working"},"156":{"dur":4,"text":"with this organization that's based right here in Claremont."},"161":{"dur":4,"text":"So, HIV, I think we could accurately say it's forgotten,"},"166":{"dur":1,"text":"but not gone."},"167":{"dur":3,"text":"This is a heat map showing the incidence of HIV"},"171":{"dur":3,"text":"in Los Angeles County, broken down by census tracts."},"174":{"dur":4,"text":"And you can see that there's these very concentrated pockets"},"178":{"dur":2,"text":"that correlate really well with poverty"},"181":{"dur":2,"text":"here in Los Angeles County."},"184":{"dur":1,"text":"Some numbers."},"185":{"dur":3,"text":"There's about 60,000 people currently living with HIV"},"188":{"dur":1,"text":"here in LA County."},"191":{"dur":3,"text":"The median age of those living with HIV is currently 48."},"195":{"dur":2,"text":"That's up from 41 in 2002."},"197":{"dur":3,"text":"And the group with the highest rate of new infections"},"201":{"dur":1,"text":"are our young people."},"202":{"dur":1,"text":"So there's a few things going on."},"203":{"dur":2,"text":"This number, 60,000, is going up."},"206":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's going up every year."},"209":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's going up for a good reason and for a bad reason."},"211":{"dur":3,"text":"The good reason is that people are living longer."},"215":{"dur":1,"text":"People who have HIV"},"218":{"dur":3,"text":"are able to take a medicine, a pill."},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"For many of them, it's just a single pill per day"},"224":{"dur":3,"text":"that enables them to live with the virus for decades."},"227":{"dur":1,"text":"Since people are living a lot longer,"},"229":{"dur":3,"text":"the HIV-positive population is green."},"233":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's the good news."},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"The bad news is that there's an alarmingly high rate"},"237":{"dur":3,"text":"of new infections, especially among young people,"},"240":{"dur":2,"text":"especially among young gay men of color,"},"243":{"dur":3,"text":"that is contributing to an increase in new infections."},"247":{"dur":1,"text":"And so we're gonna talk a little bit tonight"},"249":{"dur":2,"text":"about both of these, the progress that's been made"},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"in treatment, and what we still have to do"},"254":{"dur":4,"text":"in order to address the ongoing rates of transmission."},"259":{"dur":2,"text":"So with regards to treatment,"},"261":{"dur":4,"text":"what we're looking at now is a plot of the mortality"},"266":{"dur":3,"text":"due to HIV in the United States with time."},"270":{"dur":3,"text":"And you can see that it is going up and up and up"},"273":{"dur":1,"text":"and peaked in the mid-90s."},"275":{"dur":3,"text":"And actually, in the mid-90s, HIV was the leading cause"},"279":{"dur":3,"text":"of death for adults in America aged 24 to 41."},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"And so something happened there,"},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"something happened for this dramatic fall."},"289":{"dur":2,"text":"And what happened was the development of a protocol"},"292":{"dur":3,"text":"to treat people with HIV, in which they would take"},"295":{"dur":4,"text":"not one pill, not two pills, but three separate pills,"},"300":{"dur":1,"text":"the triple cocktail."},"301":{"dur":4,"text":"And this combination of potent antiretroviral medicines"},"306":{"dur":4,"text":"would essentially block HIV replication, stop the virus"},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"from progressing, and restore immune function."},"313":{"dur":3,"text":"And this triple cocktail therapy, then,"},"317":{"dur":3,"text":"has enabled people's lives to be restored."},"322":{"dur":4,"text":"Without treatment, someone who newly acquires HIV"},"328":{"dur":3,"text":"has a rapid rise in their viral load,"},"332":{"dur":3,"text":"the immune system kicks in in a few short weeks after that,"},"335":{"dur":4,"text":"and is able to hold the virus at bay for months, years,"},"340":{"dur":3,"text":"decade maybe, but eventually, the virus takes over."},"343":{"dur":3,"text":"The virus will wear the immune system down,"},"347":{"dur":3,"text":"spiral out of control, and it's at this point here"},"350":{"dur":2,"text":"that an HIV infection progresses to the condition"},"353":{"dur":2,"text":"known as AIDS, where the immune system fails,"},"355":{"dur":4,"text":"the body's no longer able to fight off microorganisms,"},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"and opportunistic infections arise."},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"With highly active antiretroviral therapy,"},"365":{"dur":3,"text":"with the triple cocktail, the pattern is very different."},"369":{"dur":4,"text":"The viral load goes up, once a person goes on highly active"},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"antiretroviral therapy, starts taking the pills,"},"376":{"dur":3,"text":"viral load goes down, and this dashed line is meant"},"379":{"dur":4,"text":"to represent the sensitivity of the clinical assay used"},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"to measure viral load."},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's actually below the limit of detection."},"389":{"dur":4,"text":"So someone can become undetectably low virus load"},"393":{"dur":1,"text":"by taking this medicine."},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's a very effective therapy."},"400":{"dur":3,"text":"Since the mid-90s, we've continued to make progress on this."},"404":{"dur":4,"text":"And so the newer therapies are much more potent,"},"408":{"dur":3,"text":"they have fewer and less severe side effects,"},"411":{"dur":4,"text":"and instead of having to take this number of pills per day,"},"417":{"dur":3,"text":"which is quite challenging, most people newly infected"},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"with HIV, take this number of pills per day."},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"So we continue to make a lot of improvements"},"426":{"dur":4,"text":"in the convenience of this, the toxicity being lowered,"},"431":{"dur":4,"text":"and just the overall effectiveness of blocking the virus."},"441":{"dur":3,"text":"This shows then, starting from mid-1996"},"446":{"dur":4,"text":"how we continue to decrease the mortality due to HIV."},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"This is a study done by Kaiser Permanente"},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"of their HIV-positive patients."},"455":{"dur":3,"text":"There still is a gap, but the life expectancy gap"},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"for someone living with HIV is somewhere"},"461":{"dur":1,"text":"between eight to 12 years now."},"463":{"dur":1,"text":"It used to be decades,"},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"the gap between someone positive and someone negative."},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"That gap is as small as eight to 12 years."},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"It's getting smaller every year."},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"These two lines are converging."},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"So, as we talk about the antiretrovirals,"},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"I want to say a little bit about what they do."},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"They block active replication of the virus."},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"They stop the virus from making copies of itself."},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"The virus is very, very proficient,"},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"it's just an incredibly high-powered Xerox machine"},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"that's just running ditto copies of itself."},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"The antiretrovirals stop this process completely,"},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"they unplug the ditto machine."},"504":{"dur":3,"text":"This then restores most, not all, but most,"},"507":{"dur":3,"text":"of the function of the immune system."},"511":{"dur":3,"text":"And therefore then, significantly extends the life span"},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"and improves the quality of life."},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"And what's really come out recently,"},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'll say more about this at a later part of the talk,"},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"is that someone who's on antiretrovirals"},"525":{"dur":3,"text":"also is dramatically less likely to pass the virus on"},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"to a sexual partner or someone"},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"that they might be sharing needles with."},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, the antiretrovirals are a huge tool"},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"for prevention as well as for treatment."},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, this all sounds good."},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a few things that we should be careful"},"542":{"dur":2,"text":"to keep in mind that they don't do."},"545":{"dur":3,"text":"The antiretrovirals do not cure HIV infection."},"549":{"dur":3,"text":"We do not yet have a way to cure HIV infection."},"554":{"dur":3,"text":"This is because they do not eliminate the virus,"},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"they do not kill the virus, they do not eliminate the virus."},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"All they do is stop the virus from making copies of itself."},"564":{"dur":4,"text":"And so the virus is not eliminated by the antiretrovirals."},"569":{"dur":4,"text":"And this may seem so obvious I shouldn't need to say it,"},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"but in the real world, this is one"},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"of the biggest challenges."},"578":{"dur":3,"text":"It don't work unless the person takes the pills."},"581":{"dur":3,"text":"And why someone might not take this medicine"},"584":{"dur":1,"text":"is complex and varied."},"587":{"dur":1,"text":"Some of it has to do with access,"},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"some of it has to do with other life factors."},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"We'll talk more about that as well."},"593":{"dur":4,"text":"So, as a biochemist, I'm incredibly proud that my field"},"598":{"dur":3,"text":"is able to make this contribution of the antiretrovirals."},"602":{"dur":0,"text":"And they..."},"605":{"dur":1,"text":"Way that these drugs were developed"},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"was by very carefully understanding the process"},"609":{"dur":4,"text":"by which the virus will attach and then fuse with the cell"},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"it infects, make a copy of its genetic material,"},"618":{"dur":4,"text":"insert that genetic material into the genome of the cell"},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"that it infects, and then from that genomic material,"},"626":{"dur":3,"text":"make more copies of itself which then bud off and pinch off."},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"And scientists over the years have very carefully dissected"},"633":{"dur":3,"text":"every molecular detail of this step."},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"This very complicated choreography"},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"that goes on to produce new virus."},"640":{"dur":4,"text":"We now understand the details of, the exquisite details."},"645":{"dur":4,"text":"And so that's allowed us then to target and block the virus"},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"at multiple steps in this pathway,"},"653":{"dur":4,"text":"from the initial attachment to the copying step,"},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"to the integration step, to a step that's involved"},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"in processing that then enable the virus to bud off"},"664":{"dur":1,"text":"to make a mature particle."},"666":{"dur":1,"text":"And so the drugs that we have"},"668":{"dur":3,"text":"target multiple steps in these pathways."},"671":{"dur":4,"text":"The ones that we started with, the earliest drugs,"},"676":{"dur":1,"text":"were drugs that inhibited the enzyme"},"678":{"dur":4,"text":"called reverse transcriptase that the virus uses"},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"to copy its RNA genome into DNA."},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"Later, the protease inhibitors came along,"},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"and this was in the mid-90s that was part"},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"of the original triple cocktail."},"692":{"dur":3,"text":"Nowadays in 2016, the drugs that are most commonly used,"},"695":{"dur":3,"text":"the most effective, most potent, fewest side effects"},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"are integrase inhibitors, and these are drugs"},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"that block the DNA of the virus from being inserted"},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"into the DNA of the cell that it infects."},"707":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, it's through this really detailed"},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"molecular understanding of the events of the virus"},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"that we've been able to develop these drugs."},"717":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, this all sounds wonderful, so why have we not cured it,"},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"why have we not, given all this technology,"},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"all that's been done, why haven't we been able to cure HIV,"},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"why can't we eliminate it?"},"729":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm gonna use a little bit of a cartoon to illustrate this."},"733":{"dur":3,"text":"These white blobs here are meant to be helper T cells,"},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"so these are the white blood cells that are involved"},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"in coordinating your immune system's,"},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"defending the body from infections."},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"And then here's the virus."},"747":{"dur":3,"text":"When the virus initially infects a new cell,"},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"it'll insert a copy of its genome"},"753":{"dur":3,"text":"into the genome of the cell that it infects."},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"These little squiggly lines here are meant"},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"to represent the genome of the cell."},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"And here's the genome of the cell"},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"with this extra bit of DNA in it."},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"And most of the time, what happens then,"},"769":{"dur":4,"text":"is that this cell with the DNA will express the RNA"},"774":{"dur":3,"text":"and the proteins from this DNA, to then make new viruses,"},"778":{"dur":4,"text":"which then pinch off and replenish the pool of virus."},"784":{"dur":2,"text":"And you have this vicious cycle, for the newly formed virus,"},"786":{"dur":3,"text":"then, will infect more cells, which will then make"},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"more virus, which will then make more cells,"},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"and just around and around and around it goes."},"795":{"dur":3,"text":"And something like 10 billion virus particles can be made"},"798":{"dur":3,"text":"in a day, just an astonishing number."},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"This is what happens most of the time."},"805":{"dur":4,"text":"A fraction of the time, one in a million perhaps,"},"809":{"dur":3,"text":"instead of this newly infected cell,"},"812":{"dur":3,"text":"which has the DNA from HIV, instead of that DNA"},"816":{"dur":3,"text":"being turned on, that DNA remains silent."},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, all the instructions are there,"},"823":{"dur":3,"text":"the blueprint for making more virus is there,"},"826":{"dur":3,"text":"but it's not being operated on, it's not being utilized."},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"These genes are silent."},"832":{"dur":3,"text":"So the silent genome means that we have this silent cell"},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"that it has all the instructions,"},"839":{"dur":2,"text":"but is not actually making new virus."},"841":{"dur":2,"text":"And we're gonna see in just a moment about why that matters."},"844":{"dur":2,"text":"So, the antiretroviral medicines,"},"846":{"dur":2,"text":"and so when you take your integrase inhibitor,"},"848":{"dur":1,"text":"or your protease inhibitor,"},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"or your reverse transriptase inhibitor, whatever it is,"},"852":{"dur":4,"text":"when you take the ARVs, what these do is they block"},"857":{"dur":3,"text":"this vicious cycle, they interrupt this cycle."},"860":{"dur":2,"text":"They form a wall that then prevents"},"866":{"dur":2,"text":"the virus from infecting new cells."},"868":{"dur":3,"text":"And so this big wall blocks the cycle,"},"872":{"dur":2,"text":"so there are no more newly infected cells"},"875":{"dur":3,"text":"because viral replication has been shut down."},"879":{"dur":2,"text":"These actively infected cells don't live that long."},"882":{"dur":1,"text":"It's very stressful on the cell"},"883":{"dur":2,"text":"to be making virus as well as the immune system"},"886":{"dur":3,"text":"can recognize HIV and destroy these cells,"},"890":{"dur":2,"text":"so these cells have a very short lifetime."},"893":{"dur":3,"text":"In a few weeks, they'll decay and go away,"},"896":{"dur":2,"text":"and the virus actually has an even shorter lifetime,"},"898":{"dur":2,"text":"it doesn't survive very well at all without making a copy"},"901":{"dur":4,"text":"of itself, and so the virus gradually will go away."},"905":{"dur":2,"text":"And then if you give a blood test to someone"},"908":{"dur":3,"text":"who's successful with their antiretroviral medicine,"},"911":{"dur":1,"text":"the result will be undetectable,"},"913":{"dur":2,"text":"an undetectable level of virus."},"916":{"dur":0,"text":"Super."},"918":{"dur":2,"text":"Have we cured the person?"},"921":{"dur":1,"text":"Lot of shakin' heads."},"922":{"dur":0,"text":"Why not?"},"926":{"dur":1,"text":"Right there."},"927":{"dur":4,"text":"So, through a mechanism that's not completely understood,"},"933":{"dur":3,"text":"these latently infected cells appear to reactivate"},"936":{"dur":3,"text":"at some low, but steady, rate to become active,"},"941":{"dur":2,"text":"to then make a little bit of virus."},"944":{"dur":2,"text":"And then that little bit of virus then"},"947":{"dur":3,"text":"is not able to further infect other cells."},"951":{"dur":3,"text":"And so this virus is blocked from infecting new cells,"},"954":{"dur":4,"text":"and so things don't continue, but it's still there."},"959":{"dur":2,"text":"So the truth be told about this viral load undetectable,"},"962":{"dur":2,"text":"if you go in not with the assay that's used"},"964":{"dur":3,"text":"clinically and commercially, but more sensitive techniques,"},"967":{"dur":3,"text":"things like Quantitative PCR, you can go"},"970":{"dur":3,"text":"and you can find a tiny little bit of virus,"},"975":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's always there, it's never zero,"},"978":{"dur":1,"text":"it's always just a tiny little bit."},"980":{"dur":3,"text":"And we believe that's from these latently infected cells"},"983":{"dur":3,"text":"that become reactivated and then make a little bit of virus,"},"986":{"dur":4,"text":"but then with the antiretroviral block, it stops."},"991":{"dur":4,"text":"So, this is fine, but what happens, it's a stalemate."},"996":{"dur":2,"text":"So, the medicine has to be kept on continuously,"},"999":{"dur":3,"text":"and this is why it's so important that the antiretrovirals"},"1002":{"dur":2,"text":"are taken for the rest of this person's life"},"1005":{"dur":1,"text":"on a consistent basis."},"1007":{"dur":2,"text":"'Cause what happens if you don't?"},"1010":{"dur":1,"text":"If you go on a drug furlough,"},"1011":{"dur":1,"text":"it used to be called a drug holiday,"},"1012":{"dur":4,"text":"but I don't like that term because I like holidays,"},"1017":{"dur":3,"text":"but no one likes a furlough, no one wants to be furloughed."},"1020":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you put your antiretrovirals on furlough,"},"1023":{"dur":1,"text":"what happens?"},"1025":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, if that block is gone, the cycle can start up again,"},"1029":{"dur":2,"text":"and once the cycle starts up again, it can make more virus,"},"1032":{"dur":2,"text":"and more virus, and it takes over."},"1035":{"dur":2,"text":"And this process happens very quickly."},"1037":{"dur":2,"text":"Matter of weeks or so, someone can jump"},"1039":{"dur":2,"text":"from virus load undetectable to tens of thousands,"},"1042":{"dur":3,"text":"hundreds of thousands of viral particles per mL of blood,"},"1045":{"dur":2,"text":"and so, that's why it's so important"},"1048":{"dur":4,"text":"that the treatment is given consistently throughout."},"1053":{"dur":3,"text":"Very, very important to have this consistency"},"1057":{"dur":2,"text":"to prevent the viral rebound."},"1060":{"dur":1,"text":"So, here we are."},"1062":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, people have made, as I told you,"},"1065":{"dur":1,"text":"better and better antiretrovirals,"},"1067":{"dur":2,"text":"and so the antiretrovirals we use now in 2016"},"1070":{"dur":2,"text":"are better than the ones we used in 1996,"},"1073":{"dur":2,"text":"when this therapy first came along."},"1075":{"dur":2,"text":"They're more potent, so in other words,"},"1077":{"dur":2,"text":"this wall is now much higher,"},"1081":{"dur":2,"text":"it's much more effective."},"1083":{"dur":0,"text":"We've essentially been able"},"1084":{"dur":2,"text":"to completely shut down viral replication."},"1087":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's easier to take, people are more successful with it,"},"1091":{"dur":3,"text":"it's fewer side effects, but making better and better"},"1094":{"dur":4,"text":"antiretrovirals will just make that blue block even better"},"1098":{"dur":2,"text":"and better and better, but that's not actually"},"1101":{"dur":1,"text":"getting at the problem."},"1102":{"dur":2,"text":"And so if you wanted to cure someone,"},"1104":{"dur":1,"text":"you're gonna, at some point, have to deal with"},"1106":{"dur":1,"text":"the latent cells."},"1107":{"dur":3,"text":"And antiretrovirals, which block viral replication"},"1111":{"dur":2,"text":"You need a different approach."},"1114":{"dur":3,"text":"And here is, and at this point, this has not"},"1117":{"dur":3,"text":"been achieved yet, it's something that we're trying to do,"},"1121":{"dur":1,"text":"there's clinical trials researching this."},"1123":{"dur":3,"text":"This is

the virus in the population and then make"},"1624":{"dur":2,"text":"the determination, did the virus of the person"},"1627":{"dur":3,"text":"who was negative who became positive, was that

partner."},"1650":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that's the word linked."},"1653":{"dur":3,"text":"But in talking just about within the couples"},"1658":{"dur":3,"text":"where the partner was on the meds

probability"},"1678":{"dur":2,"text":"of transmission is zero, it just means that it's really low."},"1681":{"dur":3,"text":"And we don't know how low, yet, until we do more studies"},"1684":{"dur":2,"text":"and accumulate more acts,"},"1687":{"dur":2,"text":"so we can get a better handle"},"1690":{"dur":2,"text":"on how low the probability is."},"1692":{"dur":4,"text":"At this point, we can say to the 95% confidence level"},"1697":{"dur":3,"text":"that the rate is less than .3 transmission events"},"1700":{"dur":1,"text":"per 100

prevention."},"1722":{"dur":3,"text":"Treatment is prevention because successful treatment"},"1725":{"dur":3,"text":"dramatically eliminates, maybe, at least dramatically"},"1729":{"dur":3,"text":"reduces the probability of transmission."},"1732":{"dur":4,"text":"The other way that the antiretrovirals have been used"},"1736":{"dur":4,"text":"for prevention

it"},"1861":{"dur":1,"text":"gives that person agency, which I think"},"1863":{"dur":2,"text":"is an important consideration."},"1865":{"dur":2,"text":"It also gives another means of

would,"},"1880":{"dur":3,"text":"of course, not be a part of that situation."},"1885":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's a number of reasons why someone might choose"},"1888":{"dur":2,"text":"to engage in

to receive pleasure or other reasons."},"1897":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I think the reality is, many people"},"1900":{"dur":1,"text":"do not use condoms currently."},"1901":{"dur":3,"text":"And so this gives them a protection option."},"1906":{"dur":2,"text":"And another important consideration is that PrEP"},"1909":{"dur":3,"text":"brings the HIV-negative person into systems of care"},"1912":{"dur":1,"text":"and so this means that they're actually gonna be"},"1914":{"dur":2,"text":"seeing their physician, talking about their sexual health"},"1917":{"dur":1,"text":"with the physician, which has other"},"1919":{"dur":2,"text":"positive benefits for the person."},"1922":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, there's obviously a lot of questions"},"1925":{"dur":1,"text":"and concerns about

we lose people at every step of this cascade."},"2244":{"dur":3,"text":"There's one in eight or so who don't know their status."},"2248":{"dur":1,"text":"Of those who know their status,"},"2250":{"dur":2,"text":"not everyone is getting referred to care."},"2253":{"dur":2,"text":"Of those referred to care, there's a huge drop off here"},"2256":{"dur":2,"text":"in terms of keeping them in care."},"2258":{"dur":2,"text":"And then once they're in care, we do pretty well"},"2260":{"dur":3,"text":"at getting them on antiretrovirals and virally suppressed."},"2264":{"dur":1,"text":"But there's a lot of challenges here."},"2266":{"dur":3,"text":"And then from the prevention standpoint,"},"2270":{"dur":3,"text":"the two thirds that are not represented here,"},"2275":{"dur":4,"text":"so the other 63% that are not retained in care,"},"2279":{"dur":4,"text":"that is where 90% of our new infections come from."},"2286":{"dur":3,"text":"So people that are in this group are much less likely"},"2289":{"dur":4,"text":"to pass the virus on than the people that are not in care."},"2294":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, again, the more that we can do for treatment"},"2297":{"dur":1,"text":"and the more that we can do to bring people in"},"2298":{"dur":2,"text":"to systems of care, the more that'll give us"},"2300":{"dur":1,"text":"a handle on prevention."},"2303":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, why would someone not be in care?"},"2306":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a variety of reasons."},"2308":{"dur":2,"text":"LA County had a program going on for a few years,"},"2310":{"dur":1,"text":"The Navigation Program."},"2312":{"dur":2,"text":"Out of that study, these are the reasons"},"2314":{"dur":2,"text":"why people had barriers to care."},"2318":{"dur":1,"text":"They had other life priorities."},"2319":{"dur":3,"text":"HIV was not their number one pressing issue."},"2324":{"dur":2,"text":"Especially in the early years of HIV infection,"},"2326":{"dur":4,"text":"if you're feeling healthy and fine, people have other things"},"2330":{"dur":3,"text":"that they view as being more important."},"2335":{"dur":1,"text":"There's a huge connection to poverty,"},"2336":{"dur":1,"text":"so there's a lack of money."},"2338":{"dur":2,"text":"A lack of transportation."},"2340":{"dur":2,"text":"Here in LA we don't have very good public transportation,"},"2343":{"dur":2,"text":"and so I've talked to people who have to be on a bus"},"2346":{"dur":2,"text":"for an hour or two hours to get to a doctor's appointment"},"2348":{"dur":1,"text":"that would be really easy to access"},"2349":{"dur":2,"text":"if they had access to their own car."},"2352":{"dur":2,"text":"Substance abuse is a big one."},"2355":{"dur":1,"text":"The stigma around HIV."},"2358":{"dur":1,"text":"Housing instability."},"2360":{"dur":2,"text":"Fear that someone would find out that they're positive."},"2363":{"dur":2,"text":"Not really understanding the need for their care"},"2365":{"dur":2,"text":"and just having to deal with their immigration status"},"2368":{"dur":2,"text":"and sort of their residency between countries."},"2371":{"dur":1,"text":"And so there's a number of reasons"},"2373":{"dur":2,"text":"why someone might be out of care."},"2375":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's why I've really come to appreciate"},"2378":{"dur":2,"text":"the work that Foothill AIDS Project does."},"2380":{"dur":3,"text":"When I first started working with Foothill AIDS Project,"},"2384":{"dur":2,"text":"I was expected to be introduced to their doctor"},"2386":{"dur":2,"text":"and their nurses and their pharmacists and so on,"},"2388":{"dur":1,"text":"and they actually have none of that."},"2390":{"dur":1,"text":"That's actually not what they do."},"2392":{"dur":2,"text":"They do the wraparound services."},"2394":{"dur":3,"text":"So they do all that other work that has to be done"},"2397":{"dur":1,"text":"to keep people in systems of care"},"2399":{"dur":1,"text":"and meet their other needs."},"2400":{"dur":4,"text":"Now FAP doesn't see everyone who has HIV, we see at FAP,"},"2406":{"dur":3,"text":"clients who have HIV and these other life challenges"},"2409":{"dur":2,"text":"like poverty and homelessness or drug addiction."},"2412":{"dur":4,"text":"And so we, at FAP, do case management, we do housing."},"2418":{"dur":3,"text":"We have housing is health care is our mantra,"},"2421":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's often where we start, with supportive housing,"},"2425":{"dur":2,"text":"which then helps us meet their other needs,"},"2428":{"dur":1,"text":"including their HIV needs."},"2429":{"dur":3,"text":"And so our budget, the largest fraction by far,"},"2432":{"dur":1,"text":"goes towards housing."},"2434":{"dur":2,"text":"We do a number of support groups."},"2437":{"dur":3,"text":"Address, as best we can, people's mental health needs."},"2441":{"dur":1,"text":"Deal with their substance abuse."},"2442":{"dur":3,"text":"Offer food assistance, transportation assistance,"},"2445":{"dur":1,"text":"and do health education."},"2447":{"dur":2,"text":"So these are all these missing pieces that you need"},"2450":{"dur":2,"text":"in order to be effective in responding to HIV."},"2452":{"dur":4,"text":"So I'm incredibly proud to be associated with this agency."},"2457":{"dur":4,"text":"Just to wrap it up then, my take home message is,"},"2461":{"dur":2,"text":"there is no cure for HIV yet,"},"2464":{"dur":2,"text":"but HIV is treatable right now."},"2469":{"dur":4,"text":"HIV is transmissible, but HIV is also preventable."},"2474":{"dur":2,"text":"And finally, people living with HIV"},"2476":{"dur":3,"text":"should be treated with dignity and respect."},"2479":{"dur":1,"text":"And with that, I'll close and will be happy"},"2481":{"dur":1,"text":"to answer any questions people have."},"2483":{"dur":3,"text":"(audience applauds)"},"2492":{"dur":2,"text":"- We now have time for questions and answers."},"2494":{"dur":1,"text":"if you'd like to ask a question, please raise your hand"},"2496":{"dur":2,"text":"and Sarah or I will come to you."},"2505":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Man] Hey, thanks for your talk."},"2507":{"dur":1,"text":"My question's actually pretty simple."},"2508":{"dur":2,"text":"How does treatment and fighting HIV"},"2513":{"dur":3,"text":"differ from the strategies on other STIs?"},"2518":{"dur":1,"text":"- I think the..."},"2522":{"dur":2,"text":"So the question was, how is treating HIV different"},"2525":{"dur":1,"text":"than dealing with other STIs?"},"2526":{"dur":1,"text":"I think there's a few differences."},"2527":{"dur":3,"text":"One is the stakes are a bit higher in that HIV,"},"2533":{"dur":3,"text":"we have no cure, we have no way of eliminating it period,"},"2536":{"dur":4,"text":"and so if someone acquires HIV, that's a permanent thing."},"2540":{"dur":2,"text":"They will, until we have the cure, have HIV"},"2542":{"dur":2,"text":"for the rest of their life."},"2545":{"dur":3,"text":"The other thing, too, with HIV is the stigma"},"2548":{"dur":2,"text":"associated with it is much stronger."},"2550":{"dur":2,"text":"And so talking with people who are HIV-positive,"},"2553":{"dur":2,"text":"they'll talk about the ways that they've been treated"},"2555":{"dur":4,"text":"at clubs, or in their relationships, and there's"},"2560":{"dur":1,"text":"a lot more stigma associated with that,"},"2562":{"dur":1,"text":"of being HIV-positive,"},"2564":{"dur":3,"text":"as opposed to having had an episode of syphilis"},"2567":{"dur":2,"text":"or an episode of chlamydia or an episode of gonorrhea"},"2570":{"dur":1,"text":"that was treated, but it's gone away,"},"2571":{"dur":2,"text":"doesn't carry with you in the same way."},"2574":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think those are kind of the main ways"},"2578":{"dur":1,"text":"in which they're different."},"2580":{"dur":2,"text":"Obviously, the things that you can do to prevent"},"2582":{"dur":3,"text":"other sexually transmitted diseases also apply to HIV"},"2586":{"dur":3,"text":"in terms of behavior modifications, or the use"},"2589":{"dur":3,"text":"of barriers like condoms, definitely do apply,"},"2592":{"dur":3,"text":"but I think the stigma is probably the biggest one,"},"2595":{"dur":3,"text":"which has connected a lot with the history"},"2598":{"dur":1,"text":"of the disease and also the way that it is"},"2600":{"dur":2,"text":"a lifetime long infection."},"2602":{"dur":2,"text":"A great question, thank you."},"2613":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Woman] Hi, thank you."},"2615":{"dur":3,"text":"So you mentioned how the stigma around HIV"},"2618":{"dur":3,"text":"is a huge problem for some people accessing treatment,"},"2621":{"dur":3,"text":"so how do we go about destigmatizing HIV and AIDS"},"2625":{"dur":2,"text":"and how is education involved with that"},"2627":{"dur":4,"text":"and what are the steps that we can next take to,"},"2632":{"dur":2,"text":"I guess, solve that problem?"},"2634":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, that's excellent questions."},"2635":{"dur":1,"text":"How do we deal with the stigma?"},"2637":{"dur":3,"text":"So my personal approach is whenever I get invited to speak,"},"2641":{"dur":2,"text":"I say yes, and so I've gone to Rotary clubs,"},"2643":{"dur":3,"text":"I've gone to, I'm here at the Ath tonight."},"2647":{"dur":2,"text":"Yesterday, I was at All Saints Church in Pasadena."},"2650":{"dur":3,"text":"Whenever I'm given the invitation to speak to any audience,"},"2653":{"dur":1,"text":"I go and I talk about it."},"2655":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I think that's one thing that works really well."},"2659":{"dur":3,"text":"Another thing that works really well is that I have friends"},"2662":{"dur":2,"text":"who are HIV-positive who are really committed to this issue,"},"2665":{"dur":4,"text":"very vocal on this issue and are very unafraid to stand up"},"2669":{"dur":3,"text":"and talk to a room of people, as someone who's HIV-positive."},"2673":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I've met some wonderful people who do this work."},"2676":{"dur":4,"text":"And they do a great job of putting the human face to it,"},"2680":{"dur":4,"text":"of making it personal and I think that helps a lot."},"2684":{"dur":2,"text":"I think, in general, as a country, we need"},"2687":{"dur":3,"text":"to do a lot more with sexual health education"},"2691":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's part of the problem"},"2694":{"dur":2,"text":"that we face is that there's a large amount"},"2697":{"dur":1,"text":"of local control in this."},"2699":{"dur":2,"text":"And there are school districts that are very progressive"},"2701":{"dur":3,"text":"in their approaches to sex ed and there are school districts"},"2704":{"dur":3,"text":"that are stuck in the 1950s in terms of their approaches."},"2708":{"dur":4,"text":"And so I think that one of my students who took my class"},"2712":{"dur":4,"text":"on HIV\/AIDS last year was a Pitzer student, she's now"},"2716":{"dur":1,"text":"in a Watson Fellowship, sort of looking"},"2718":{"dur":2,"text":"at this really important issue."},"2722":{"dur":3,"text":"I wish I had more answers to say than that."},"2730":{"dur":1,"text":"Other questions."},"2741":{"dur":2,"text":"- [Woman] You mentioned the problem of people"},"2743":{"dur":4,"text":"skipping doses and anyone who takes any kind of medication"},"2747":{"dur":3,"text":"knows that there are times you're gonna forget."},"2751":{"dur":4,"text":"So how many times do, what happens if you skip once?"},"2757":{"dur":1,"text":"Or for a week?"},"2758":{"dur":2,"text":"In other words, how long does it take"},"2760":{"dur":1,"text":"before it really has an impact?"},"2762":{"dur":1,"text":"- Right, that's a great question."},"2763":{"dur":1,"text":"And the good news is it's getting better."},"2765":{"dur":2,"text":"The newer doses, because they're more potent,"},"2767":{"dur":2,"text":"because they have a longer lifetime in the blood,"},"2770":{"dur":4,"text":"they're much more forgiving than the old drugs were."},"2775":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact, there looking at protocols now,"},"2778":{"dur":3,"text":"with teenage patients, of giving them their weekends off."},"2781":{"dur":2,"text":"Where you can take your drug five days a week,"},"2783":{"dur":2,"text":"and then you get Saturday and Sunday off"},"2786":{"dur":1,"text":"and then go back on."},"2787":{"dur":2,"text":"And with the newer drugs that are more potent,"},"2790":{"dur":2,"text":"that have a longer lifetime in the body,"},"2792":{"dur":4,"text":"it's possible to start thinking about regimens that way."},"2798":{"dur":1,"text":"We'd love to eventually get to a place"},"2799":{"dur":2,"text":"where we can do something like a long-acting injectable,"},"2802":{"dur":1,"text":"similar to what's done with contraception,"},"2804":{"dur":2,"text":"where we could have an injection in the arm"},"2806":{"dur":3,"text":"that will then last you a month or a few months"},"2809":{"dur":2,"text":"to get around that problem."},"2811":{"dur":3,"text":"To show you just some data, and I'm gonna see"},"2814":{"dur":2,"text":"if I can find it here really quick."},"2819":{"dur":1,"text":"It doesn't actually take that long,"},"2820":{"dur":2,"text":"especially with the old drugs."},"2823":{"dur":2,"text":"So this was a study done in 2000,"},"2827":{"dur":3,"text":"where they did a structured interruption as a study,"},"2831":{"dur":3,"text":"and so week zero, they stopped the treatment"},"2835":{"dur":1,"text":"and then the red line is the viral load"},"2836":{"dur":1,"text":"and then they followed the viral load"},"2838":{"dur":1,"text":"to see what would happen."},"2839":{"dur":2,"text":"This is before they knew that HAART wasn't curative,"},"2842":{"dur":1,"text":"they thought it might be."},"2843":{"dur":2,"text":"And so for this patient here, for example, after one week,"},"2846":{"dur":2,"text":"there was still a viral load undetectable,"},"2848":{"dur":1,"text":"which means less than 50."},"2850":{"dur":3,"text":"Week two, there were about 700 copies per mL."},"2853":{"dur":2,"text":"Week three, they were at 10,000."},"2855":{"dur":1,"text":"Week four, they were at 100,000."},"2857":{"dur":3,"text":"And so it's pretty consistently week or two"},"2861":{"dur":2,"text":"leads to full viral rebound."},"2864":{"dur":4,"text":"So, it's certainly an issue and the worry is that"},"2869":{"dur":4,"text":"when you do this, and this was like a full stop,"},"2873":{"dur":2,"text":"it's actually even more worrisome though, say,"},"2875":{"dur":4,"text":"if you take half the doses, and so then the drug is present,"},"2880":{"dur":2,"text":"but at a subtherapeutic level consistently,"},"2883":{"dur":2,"text":"that then gives a selective advantage to viruses"},"2886":{"dur":3,"text":"that have mutated to escape that drug, which would then"},"2889":{"dur":2,"text":"become the dominant strain that prevails in the body,"},"2892":{"dur":2,"text":"so that's a way, a sense, and then you have to switch"},"2894":{"dur":3,"text":"regimens because that particular drug combination"},"2897":{"dur":2,"text":"would no longer work for you."},"2907":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Woman] What's the state of the science"},"2908":{"dur":2,"text":"right now on vaccination?"},"2910":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yeah, so great question."},"2913":{"dur":3,"text":"It's not my huge area of expertise and so I'll just tell you"},"2917":{"dur":3,"text":"a little bit just from an outsider perspective,"},"2920":{"dur":1,"text":"we're not there yet."},"2922":{"dur":1,"text":"We have had a few"},"2927":{"dur":2,"text":"rather public big, splashy failures,"},"2930":{"dur":2,"text":"which were frustrating setbacks."},"2932":{"dur":2,"text":"The closest we've come, that I'm aware of,"},"2935":{"dur":2,"text":"and it may have progressed a little bit since then,"},"2937":{"dur":4,"text":"is a vaccine that was tested in Thailand, the RV144 trial,"},"2942":{"dur":1,"text":"and this is from a few years ago."},"2943":{"dur":3,"text":"And it seemed to be about 30% efficacious and so it would,"},"2947":{"dur":2,"text":"compared to placebo, it would reduce the risk"},"2950":{"dur":2,"text":"of transmission by about 30%."},"2952":{"dur":2,"text":"That's not particularly good, and so it's probably"},"2955":{"dur":2,"text":"not ready for prime time, yet."},"2958":{"dur":4,"text":"It's a very challenging virus to vaccinate against."},"2963":{"dur":4,"text":"For one thing, it literally is a wolf in sheep's clothing."},"2968":{"dur":1,"text":"It cloaks itself, and let's see if I can come up"},"2969":{"dur":2,"text":"with a picture that shows this."},"2972":{"dur":2,"text":"If I can just find that slide."},"2974":{"dur":2,"text":"It coats itself in sheep's clothing"},"2978":{"dur":3,"text":"and so this is an image of the envelope protein,"},"2982":{"dur":1,"text":"which is on the out, it's the outside,"},"2984":{"dur":2,"text":"it's a spike on the outside of the virus."},"2986":{"dur":1,"text":"This is the viral membrane."},"2988":{"dur":3,"text":"This is a spike that comes out of the virus"},"2991":{"dur":2,"text":"and all those blue patches there,"},"2996":{"dur":4,"text":"those are carbohydrates that are derived from the host cell,"},"3000":{"dur":2,"text":"so they're human carbohydrates,"},"3002":{"dur":4,"text":"human synthesized carbohydrates, that look like us."},"3006":{"dur":4,"text":"And our immune system is programmed to not recognize self."},"3012":{"dur":3,"text":"There's a very strong bias against not recognizing self."},"3016":{"dur":1,"text":"And for good reason, that's what leads"},"3017":{"dur":1,"text":"to autoimmune disease."},"3019":{"dur":2,"text":"And so the virus is literally coated with all these"},"3021":{"dur":3,"text":"human-derived sugars, which then make developing"},"3025":{"dur":2,"text":"an antibody response very difficult."},"3027":{"dur":3,"text":"And this slide is indicating particular sites"},"3030":{"dur":3,"text":"where particular antibodies have been discovered"},"3034":{"dur":3,"text":"that do bind to the envelope and neutralize it."},"3039":{"dur":2,"text":"We haven't yet figured out how to deliver a shot,"},"3042":{"dur":2,"text":"an injection, that would stimulate the body"},"3044":{"dur":3,"text":"to make these antibodies on their own."},"3050":{"dur":2,"text":"The hopeful thing is that we've found antibodies"},"3053":{"dur":2,"text":"that can do it and there are people even who are looking"},"3056":{"dur":2,"text":"at giving these antibodies in a passive mode."},"3058":{"dur":2,"text":"What we'd love to be able to do is to come up with something"},"3061":{"dur":2,"text":"that we can inject that would stimulate the

primarily"},"3162":{"dur":2,"text":"through heterosexual contact."},"3164":{"dur":3,"text":"Here in the United States, the main driver"},"3167":{"dur":2,"text":"is men who have sex with men."},"3169":{"dur":2,"text":"I have some data here on that."},"3173":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is United States from '94 to 2006."},"3179":{"dur":2,"text":"We keep it going out another 10 years."},"3181":{"dur":2,"text":"The trends look pretty similar."},"3183":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean this kind of levels out."},"3185":{"dur":4,"text":"And so male-to-male sexual contact is the primary one,"},"3190":{"dur":3,"text":"followed by heterosexual contact, injection drug use,"},"3193":{"dur":4,"text":"sort of a mixture of those, and then a miscellaneous,

wraparound services that enable you"},"3423":{"dur":2,"text":"to get people and keep them in care"},"3426":{"dur":3,"text":"and I think there's a lot of concern about the

the costs associated"},"3467":{"dur":2,"text":"with therapy for ARVs and PrEP?"},"3471":{"dur":1,"text":"- That's a great question."},"3472":{"dur":2,"text":"So it depends where you live."},"3475":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're in the United States, it's quite expensive,"},"3477":{"dur":3,"text":"something on the order of $13,000 a year."},"3482":{"dur":4,"text":"And so that's because these are brand name drugs"},"3487":{"dur":2,"text":"and you're paying brand name prices."},"3489":{"dur":3,"text":"Generic price, sort of cost to manufacture price,"},"3493":{"dur":2,"text":"is something more like $400 a year,"},"3496":{"dur":2,"text":"so something like about a dollar per day."},"3498":{"dur":3,"text":"And so one of the things that has happened in recent years"},"3502":{"dur":3,"text":"is through a lot of pressure the pharmaceutical companies"},"3505":{"dur":4,"text":"have made the drugs available at cost to manufacture"},"3510":{"dur":1,"text":"either through direct sales"},"3511":{"dur":3,"text":"or through enabling generic production."},"3515":{"dur":4,"text":"In the parts of the world that cannot

have the slide here."},"3574":{"dur":2,"text":"In the United States, the..."},"3582":{"dur":3,"text":"Here, I'll just come back to this one."},"3586":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is the death rate per 100,000 in the population."},"3590":{"dur":3,"text":"They actually have all sorts of causes."},"3593":{"dur":2,"text":"Sort of interesting to see what people are,"},"3596":{"dur":4,"text":"and this is for a particular age group, 25 to 44."},"3602":{"dur":1,"text":"Something like"},"3607":{"dur":2,"text":"four per 100,000 on an annual basis,"},"3609":{"dur":1,"text":"and so it's,"},"3612":{"dur":1,"text":"it's relatively low."},"3614":{"dur":2,"text":"Globally, the death rate from HIV,"},"3619":{"dur":3,"text":"the mortality rate is something on the order"},"3622":{"dur":1,"text":"of about 1.9 million per year,"},"3624":{"dur":2,"text":"which is an extraordinarily high number."},"3627":{"dur":0,"text":"Way too high."},"3628":{"dur":3,"text":"It's down from a peak of about 2.5 million."},"3632":{"dur":2,"text":"So we've made a lot of progress"},"3635":{"dur":4,"text":"and so going from 2.5 million down to 1.9 million"},"3641":{"dur":1,"text":"feels like great progress."},"3642":{"dur":2,"text":"1.9 million is still a really, really large number"},"3644":{"dur":4,"text":"and so I think we still a lot of progress to make."},"3651":{"dur":2,"text":"Globally, there's something like 33 million people"},"3653":{"dur":4,"text":"living with HIV, of whom about 12 million are in treatment."},"3667":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Woman] Thanks, Karl."},"3668":{"dur":4,"text":"Would you comment on World AIDS Day celebration on Thursday?"},"3675":{"dur":1,"text":"- I would be delighted to,

at Pomona, and then back"},"3726":{"dur":1,"text":"to the church for a reception."},"3727":{"dur":0,"text":"It's a beautiful event."},"3728":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a time that many people who lost loved ones"},"3731":{"dur":3,"text":"to HIV come to remember the ones that they've lost."},"3735":{"dur":1,"text":"It's also a time for people who are living"},"3736":{"dur":2,"text":"with HIV to gather in solidarity."},"3740":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a beautiful event."},"3742":{"dur":2,"text":"Again, that's Thursday at 7pm"},"3744":{"dur":3,"text":"at the Claremont United Church of Christ."},"3755":{"dur":3,"text":"- [Woman] What kind of side effects are there to the drugs?"},"3758":{"dur":4,"text":"- That's a great question and so what sort of side effects"},"3763":{"dur":2,"text":"do the antiretrovirals have?"},"3767":{"dur":4,"text":"Drugs, the side effects were many and they were quite severe"},"3772":{"dur":1,"text":"and the things like"},"3778":{"dur":3,"text":"highly elevated risk for cardiovascular disease,"},"3781":{"dur":2,"text":"an imbalance in your lipids."},"3787":{"dur":3,"text":"We've moved away and we think that a lot of those"},"3791":{"dur":2,"text":"side effects were due to protease inhibitors class of drugs,"},"3794":{"dur":3,"text":"which is part of why we've moved away from that class."},"3798":{"dur":2,"text":"The newer drugs, since like, let's say Truvada, for example,"},"3801":{"dur":2,"text":"which is a drug that's used in PrEP,"},"3803":{"dur":3,"text":"the biggest toxicities are renal toxicity"},"3807":{"dur":3,"text":"and so you can monitor that by doing blood tests"},"3811":{"dur":3,"text":"and watching out for renal function."},"3815":{"dur":4,"text":"What we know is that the side effects are there."},"3820":{"dur":4,"text":"The drugs, though, have fewer side effects than the virus."},"3824":{"dur":3,"text":"And so there was a study that was done in,"},"3829":{"dur":1,"text":"well, stopped in 2006."},"3832":{"dur":1,"text":"And what they did with the study"},"3833":{"dur":2,"text":"is they tried to give less drug."},"3836":{"dur":2,"text":"And so they would have people who were stably"},"3838":{"dur":2,"text":"virally suppressed and they would take them off their"},"3841":{"dur":3,"text":"medicine to spare them the side effects of the drug,"},"3844":{"dur":4,"text":"and they would put them back on when their CD4 count fell."},"3848":{"dur":1,"text":"That was what one group did."},"3849":{"dur":1,"text":"And then the other group, this was done"},"3851":{"dur":1,"text":"by random assignment,"},"3854":{"dur":2,"text":"just stayed on their meds continuously."},"3856":{"dur":4,"text":"And so it was sort of a competition to see, alright,"},"3860":{"dur":3,"text":"if you give less drug, so fewer side effects of the drug,"},"3864":{"dur":2,"text":"but more virus replication, is that better or worse"},"3866":{"dur":3,"text":"than more drug which is more side effects, but less virus."},"3870":{"dur":2,"text":"And so it was a randomized clinical trial."},"3873":{"dur":1,"text":"The SMART trial, Strategies for Management"},"3875":{"dur":1,"text":"of Antiretroviral Therapy."},"3876":{"dur":3,"text":"And they actually had to stop it early."},"3880":{"dur":1,"text":"The Data Safety Monitoring Board halted it"},"3882":{"dur":1,"text":"because the results were so clear,"},"3883":{"dur":1,"text":"they couldn't keep on going."},"3885":{"dur":2,"text":"And so the group that had treatment interruptions,"},"3888":{"dur":4,"text":"that had less drug, so fewer side effects from drugs,"},"3892":{"dur":2,"text":"they had more HIV associated problems."},"3894":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think everyone kind of anticipated that,"},"3897":{"dur":2,"text":"but the hope was that by giving less drugs,"},"3900":{"dur":1,"text":"there would be fewer of these side effects,"},"3901":{"dur":1,"text":"but actually what they saw instead"},"3903":{"dur":2,"text":"and it was sort of surprising, and especially"},"3905":{"dur":2,"text":"how dramatically strong the effect was,"},"3908":{"dur":2,"text":"the people that took less drug compared"},"3910":{"dur":3,"text":"to those who took more drug, the people who took less drug"},"3913":{"dur":2,"text":"had more heart disease, heart disease was known"},"3916":{"dur":2,"text":"to be a major side effect, more kidney disease,"},"3919":{"dur":1,"text":"which was also known to be a side effect,"},"3921":{"dur":2,"text":"more liver disease, also a side effect"},"3924":{"dur":2,"text":"and just more morbidity and mortality from all causes."},"3926":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, on essentially every measure they looked at,"},"3930":{"dur":3,"text":"having less drug actually made the person sicker."},"3933":{"dur":2,"text":"That the virus itself is toxic."},"3936":{"dur":3,"text":"The virus itself damages multiple organs,"},"3939":{"dur":3,"text":"not just the immune system, but multiple organs"},"3942":{"dur":3,"text":"and so because of this, this was part of the,"},"3946":{"dur":4,"text":"this was one of the studies that led to the recommendation"},"3950":{"dur":3,"text":"of this universal prescription of the antiretrovirals."},"3953":{"dur":2,"text":"That regardless of CD4 count, regardless of whether"},"3956":{"dur":3,"text":"the person is sick or healthy, the antiretrovirals,"},"3959":{"dur":4,"text":"because the virus does more harm than the drugs do."},"3969":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Michael] Fortunately, that's all the time"},"3971":{"dur":1,"text":"we'll
