designers."},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"And they were just\nvery close friends"},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"who also I respected\ntheir work a lot."},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's just like,\nI've always

her\ndo music, and then it"},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"was natural to ask her to\ndo the music for the video."},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"So everything I do\nis very

interject,"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"Tess is actually a really easy\nperson to collaborate with too."},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"I think a lot of designers have\ngimmicks in each collection,"},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"or like maybe even a kind\nof extremely intense theme"},"647":{"dur":1,"text":"that continues throughout\ntheir collections."},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think in order to\ncollaborate with someone"},"652":{"dur":1,"text":"like that, you feel\nlike you really"},"653":{"dur":3,"text":"have to make something that\ngoes with the particular story"},"657":{"dur":0,"text":"or the theme."},"658":{"dur":3,"text":"But Tess' work is so\nopen that it really"},"662":{"dur":4,"text":"allows you to not only explore\nwithin your own

while"},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"actually, but hadn't had\nthe right opportunity."},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"And the clothes presented\nthe perfect way to do it."},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"But also, I think it allows\npeople to do something that's,"},"683":{"dur":3,"text":"like, peaceful and neutral\nand tasteful and textured."},"687":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's really a great\nenvironment to collaborate in."},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"JULIE GILHART: What's\nthe-- both of you"},"694":{"dur":3,"text":"all should comment--\nwhat's the process?"},"697":{"dur":3,"text":"Like, do you come\ntogether and say, well,"},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"what are we going to do?"},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"Or is it like, I have this\nidea, and you expand on it?"},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"How does that work, or is\nit

little\nfilms, or videos together."},"716":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think each time started\nwith a meeting, just talking,"},"721":{"dur":3,"text":"lunch, whatever-- talking\nabout what she was working on,"},"725":{"dur":1,"text":"what I was working on."},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"And then me looking\nat the clothes"},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"that she was working on that\nshe wanted to put in the video."},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, just thinking\nabout the practical stuff,"},"734":{"dur":1,"text":"like the music and the location."},"736":{"dur":3,"text":"And all of that comes\ntogether to-- it's"},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"not like we're working with\nmillion-dollar budgets,"},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"so you're not dreaming\nup fantasy worlds"},"745":{"dur":0,"text":"and making them happen."},"746":{"dur":1,"text":"You have to work\nwith what you have."},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"So the location, the music,\nthe clothes, all of it"},"751":{"dur":3,"text":"comes together to inspire\nwhat you end up with."},"754":{"dur":1,"text":"And what you end\nup with is usually"},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"a little bit different from\nwhat the original idea is."},"760":{"dur":4,"text":"Like, for the video that we\nall just worked on together,"},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"I had this idea of\nspiders in my head."},"767":{"dur":5,"text":"And Tess had this kind of giant\ncrochet piece in her runway"},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"show, and it kind of\nlooked like a spider web."},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"It just all felt right to me."},"778":{"dur":4,"text":"And now when you see the video,\nyou don't think of a spider."},"783":{"dur":3,"text":"There's no spiders in the video."},"787":{"dur":1,"text":"The clothes aren't spidery."},"788":{"dur":4,"text":"It sounds

Yeah."},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a fashion\nthing, I think, and I"},"799":{"dur":5,"text":"think if you're making films,\nor if you're making art,"},"804":{"dur":1,"text":"or whatever you're\nmaking, it always"},"806":{"dur":1,"text":"changes during the process."},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"It always changes\nas you're working."},"809":{"dur":6,"text":"JULIE GILHART: It's

have access to people that"},"834":{"dur":4,"text":"are doing things on a\nfashion level in places"},"838":{"dur":5,"text":"like Afghanistan or Nigeria\nor just crazy places"},"844":{"dur":5,"text":"that I would never look, or\nyou would never have access to."},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"But the thing that\nI look at the most"},"851":{"dur":4,"text":"is videos, because\nthey all have videos."},"855":{"dur":4,"text":"And so you're looking at\na picture of girls or men"},"859":{"dur":3,"text":"in clothing, and you're\nreading, and you're"},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"looking at all their facts--\nthe age of the designer,"},"865":{"dur":1,"text":"and how many collections\nthat they've done."},"867":{"dur":2,"text":"But it's really the\nvideo that speaks."},"869":{"dur":4,"text":"And then, addressing the\nmusic thing for a show,"},"874":{"dur":3,"text":"that is so much a\npart of the show."},"877":{"dur":5,"text":"You could have a great\nshow with great clothes,"},"882":{"dur":3,"text":"and if the music isn't\ngood, it can fall flat."},"886":{"dur":2,"text":"And it can actually change\nyour perception of the clothes."},"888":{"dur":2,"text":"It's distracting."},"891":{"dur":5,"text":"But the reverse, if you have\ngreat music, it can also--"},"896":{"dur":1,"text":"CAROLINE POLACHEK: It's\nso subconscious, too."},"898":{"dur":1,"text":"It totally sneaks\nin the back door."},"900":{"dur":1,"text":"You're looking at the\nclothes, and if the music"},"902":{"dur":1,"text":"is heavy and hard, you\ndon't even realize it,"},"904":{"dur":3,"text":"but you're attributing that\nenergy to the clothes, too."},"907":{"dur":2,"text":"Like, you could show a\npiece that's really dainty."},"909":{"dur":1,"text":"And if it's paired\nwith hard music,"},"911":{"dur":1,"text":"you all of a sudden\nimagine it being"},"912":{"dur":2,"text":"worn in a really specific way."},"915":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm kind of new to\nworking in fashion at all."},"919":{"dur":1,"text":"And one thing that I\nlove that designers"},"921":{"dur":2,"text":"say when they're designing,\nis they talk about their girl."},"923":{"dur":1,"text":"Like, who's your\ngirl this season?"},"925":{"dur":1,"text":"And at first I didn't\nreally understand"},"926":{"dur":1,"text":"what they were talking about."},"927":{"dur":1,"text":"But they visualize a person."},"929":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's not just the clothes."},"930":{"dur":1,"text":"You can visualize\nwhere it's going"},"932":{"dur":5,"text":"to be worn, where she\nlives, how old she is,"},"937":{"dur":0,"text":"what she listens to."},"938":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think the fashion\nshow is the manifestation"},"940":{"dur":1,"text":"not of just a\ncollection, but the girl."},"942":{"dur":2,"text":"And that plays back into\nmarketing and branding."},"944":{"dur":2,"text":"And that to me is
