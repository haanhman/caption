{"12":{"dur":4,"text":"I'd like to tell you a story\nabout death and architecture."},"16":{"dur":4,"text":"A hundred years ago, we tended to die\nof infectious diseases like pneumonia,"},"21":{"dur":3,"text":"that, if they took hold,\nwould take us away quite quickly."},"24":{"dur":3,"text":"We tended to die at home,\nin our own beds, looked after by family,"},"28":{"dur":1,"text":"although that was the default option"},"30":{"dur":2,"text":"because a lot of people\nlacked access to medical care."},"33":{"dur":2,"text":"And then in the 20th century\na lot of things changed."},"36":{"dur":2,"text":"We developed new medicines like penicillin"},"38":{"dur":2,"text":"so we could treat\nthose infectious diseases."},"40":{"dur":3,"text":"New medical technologies\nlike x-ray machines were invented."},"44":{"dur":2,"text":"And because they were\nso big and expensive,"},"46":{"dur":3,"text":"we needed large, centralized\nbuildings to keep them in,"},"49":{"dur":2,"text":"and they became our modern hospitals."},"51":{"dur":1,"text":"After the Second World War,"},"53":{"dur":2,"text":"a lot of countries set up \nuniversal healthcare systems"},"55":{"dur":2,"text":"so that everyone who needed\ntreatment could get it."},"58":{"dur":4,"text":"The result was that lifespans extended\nfrom about 45 at the start of the century"},"62":{"dur":2,"text":"to almost double that today."},"64":{"dur":4,"text":"The 20th century was this time of huge \noptimism about what science could offer,"},"69":{"dur":3,"text":"but with all of the focus on life,\ndeath was forgotten,"},"72":{"dur":2,"text":"even as our approach to death\nchanged dramatically."},"75":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, I'm an architect,"},"76":{"dur":3,"text":"and for the past year and a half\nI've been looking at these changes"},"80":{"dur":3,"text":"and at what they mean for architecture\nrelated to death and dying."},"83":{"dur":3,"text":"We now tend to die\nof cancer and heart disease,"},"86":{"dur":3,"text":"and what that means is that many of us\nwill have a long period of chronic illness"},"90":{"dur":1,"text":"at the end of our lives."},"92":{"dur":1,"text":"During that period,"},"93":{"dur":5,"text":"we'll likely spend a lot of time \nin hospitals and hospices and care homes."},"98":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, we've all been in a modern hospital."},"100":{"dur":3,"text":"You know those fluorescent lights\nand the endless corridors"},"104":{"dur":3,"text":"and those rows of uncomfortable chairs."},"107":{"dur":3,"text":"Hospital architecture\nhas earned its bad reputation."},"110":{"dur":3,"text":"But the surprising thing is,\nit wasn't always like this."},"114":{"dur":4,"text":"This is L'Ospedale degli Innocenti,\nbuilt in 1419 by Brunelleschi,"},"118":{"dur":3,"text":"who was one of the most famous\nand influential architects of his time."},"122":{"dur":3,"text":"And when I look at this building\nand then think about hospitals today,"},"125":{"dur":3,"text":"what amazes me is\nthis building's ambition."},"128":{"dur":1,"text":"It's just a really great building."},"130":{"dur":1,"text":"It has these courtyards in the middle"},"132":{"dur":2,"text":"so that all of the rooms\nhave daylight and fresh air,"},"134":{"dur":2,"text":"and the rooms are big\nand they have high ceilings,"},"137":{"dur":2,"text":"so they just feel\nmore comfortable to be in."},"139":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's also beautiful."},"141":{"dur":3,"text":"Somehow, we've forgotten\nthat that's even possible for a hospital."},"145":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, if we want better buildings\nfor dying, then we have to talk about it,"},"149":{"dur":2,"text":"but because we find the subject\nof death uncomfortable,"},"151":{"dur":1,"text":"we don't talk about it,"},"153":{"dur":3,"text":"and we don't question how we\nas a society approach death."},"156":{"dur":3,"text":"One of the things that surprised me\nmost in my research, though,"},"159":{"dur":2,"text":"is how changeable attitudes actually are."},"162":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the first crematorium in the U.K.,"},"164":{"dur":2,"text":"which was built in Woking in the 1870s."},"167":{"dur":3,"text":"And when this was first built,\nthere were protests in the local village."},"170":{"dur":4,"text":"Cremation wasn't socially acceptable,\nand 99.8 percent of people got buried."},"175":{"dur":3,"text":"And yet, only a hundred years later,\nthree quarters of us get cremated."},"179":{"dur":2,"text":"People are actually really open\nto changing things"},"182":{"dur":2,"text":"if they're given the chance\nto talk about them."},"184":{"dur":3,"text":"So this conversation\nabout death and architecture"},"187":{"dur":3,"text":"was what I wanted to start\nwhen I did my first exhibition on it"},"190":{"dur":3,"text":"in Venice in June,\nwhich was called \"Death in Venice.\""},"194":{"dur":3,"text":"It was designed to be quite playful"},"197":{"dur":2,"text":"so that people would\nliterally engage with it."},"199":{"dur":3,"text":"This is one of our exhibits,\nwhich is an interactive map of London"},"202":{"dur":2,"text":"that shows just how much\nof the real estate in the city"},"205":{"dur":1,"text":"is given over to death and dying,"},"207":{"dur":2,"text":"and as you wave your hand across the map,"},"209":{"dur":4,"text":"the name of that piece of real estate,\nthe building or cemetery, is revealed."},"214":{"dur":2,"text":"Another of our exhibits\nwas a series of postcards"},"217":{"dur":1,"text":"that people could take away with them."},"219":{"dur":2,"text":"And they showed people's homes\nand hospitals"},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"and cemeteries and mortuaries,"},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"and they tell the story\nof the different spaces"},"226":{"dur":2,"text":"that we pass through\non either side of death."},"229":{"dur":2,"text":"We wanted to show\nthat where we die"},"231":{"dur":3,"text":"is a key part of how we die."},"234":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, the strangest thing was the way\nthat visitors reacted to the exhibition,"},"239":{"dur":2,"text":"especially the audio-visual works."},"242":{"dur":3,"text":"We had people dancing\nand running and jumping"},"245":{"dur":2,"text":"as they tried to activate\nthe exhibits in different ways,"},"248":{"dur":2,"text":"and at a certain point\nthey would kind of stop"},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"and remember that they were in\nan exhibition about death,"},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"and that maybe that's not\nhow you're supposed to act."},"256":{"dur":2,"text":"But actually, I would question\nwhether there is one way"},"259":{"dur":2,"text":"that you're supposed to act around death,"},"261":{"dur":4,"text":"and if there's not, I'd ask you to think\nabout what you think a good death is,"},"266":{"dur":3,"text":"and what you think that architecture\nthat supports a good death might be like,"},"269":{"dur":4,"text":"and mightn't it be a little less like this\nand a little more like this?"},"274":{"dur":2,"text":"Thank you."},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"(Applause)"}}
