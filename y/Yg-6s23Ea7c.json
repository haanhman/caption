they?"},"777":{"dur":3,"text":"They have some wrinkles\nand some squishy parts,"},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"and underneath they aren't very nice."},"783":{"dur":3,"text":"And here, look at this\none, has all kinds of"},"788":{"dur":1,"text":"interesting things to it."},"790":{"dur":3,"text":"And these are black\nkrim and Morgan lifters,"},"796":{"dur":1,"text":"are what these

this is the kind of\ntomato we used to have,"},"822":{"dur":4,"text":"and the kind of tomato\nour mothers would can."},"826":{"dur":4,"text":"And but they're\nwonderful-tasting, but as you see,"},"831":{"dur":2,"text":"they aren't perfect."},"833":{"dur":4,"text":"So you do want to wash\nyour tomatoes and dry them,"},"837":{"dur":3,"text":"and then you want to blanch\nthem, so that you can"},"841":{"dur":2,"text":"take their skins off."},"843":{"dur":4,"text":"Now some people prefer that\nthey just use the skins, too."},"848":{"dur":3,"text":"And there are certainly\nvitamins in the skins."},"851":{"dur":4,"text":"I usually want to have my\ntomatoes peeled, and so"},"855":{"dur":4,"text":"what I do is I bring water\nto a boil in a kettle,"},"863":{"dur":4,"text":"just on the stove top, and\nI just drop my tomatoes"},"867":{"dur":1,"text":"into the boiling water."},"870":{"dur":3,"text":"And it usually, depending\non the size, and the"},"874":{"dur":3,"text":"ripeness of the tomato,\nit doesn't take long."},"877":{"dur":3,"text":"And then I just bring\nthem to the sink, submerge"},"880":{"dur":3,"text":"them in cold water, and the\nskin just peels right off,"},"884":{"dur":2,"text":"it's just amazing."},"886":{"dur":4,"text":"But I quarter mine, and\nthen cook them that way,"},"890":{"dur":1,"text":"and then can it hot."},"892":{"dur":4,"text":"I pour the liquid hot into\nthe hot jars, I have my"},"897":{"dur":2,"text":"jars that have been cleaned."},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"You should put them in\nboiling water so that they"},"902":{"dur":3,"text":"get very hot, and the\nbacteria's dead in there."},"906":{"dur":3,"text":"And then if we're going to\ndo tomatoes, which we are,"},"909":{"dur":4,"text":"that's what we are doing,\nbecause this has a higher pH,"},"916":{"dur":3,"text":"we want to lower it to\nat least a 4.5 or six,"},"921":{"dur":4,"text":"so what you will need to do,\nis before you put the tomatoes"},"926":{"dur":3,"text":"in, if it is a quart\njar, you need to to add"},"931":{"dur":4,"text":"two tablespoons of ReaLemon,\nRealLemon the brand name"},"937":{"dur":3,"text":"that you can

variety."},"948":{"dur":1,"text":"- That's exactly right."},"950":{"dur":2,"text":"Just like these vary with\nthe amount of acidity"},"952":{"dur":4,"text":"the have in by the\nvariety, lemons do also."},"957":{"dur":4,"text":"Now if you do pints, you\nonly put in one tablespoon."},"961":{"dur":2,"text":"- Now, I put a little bit\nof salt into my tomatoes too"},"964":{"dur":4,"text":"and is that for flavor\nor for preservation?"},"968":{"dur":3,"text":"- It will do both, it will\ndo both of those things."},"972":{"dur":3,"text":"A lot of people put salt in for flavor,"},"975":{"dur":4,"text":"especially if you're canning\nsomething like just tomatoes,"},"980":{"dur":1,"text":"like tomato juice."},"983":{"dur":2,"text":"- [Mary] Then how do we\nprepare the lids and the screw"},"985":{"dur":2,"text":"bands, do we have to do\nanything special with them?"},"988":{"dur":4,"text":"- Well then well you fill\nthem, and it's important"},"993":{"dur":4,"text":"that when the lid goes on,\nand you look at the jar,"},"998":{"dur":3,"text":"that there's a half an inch head space,"},"1001":{"dur":2,"text":"it's called the head space."},"1004":{"dur":3,"text":"Jams and jellies is a fourth of an inch,"},"1007":{"dur":3,"text":"most other things are a half inch."},"1010":{"dur":4,"text":"That space is there to create\nthe

want too\nlarge a space, because then"},"1025":{"dur":3,"text":"it doesn't have enough heat\nin there, it might seal it,"},"1029":{"dur":4,"text":"but there might also\nbe bacteria still alive"},"1033":{"dur":2,"text":"in there, and it has spoiled."},"1038":{"dur":3,"text":"And some of that is not\ngood for your health at all,"},"1042":{"dur":1,"text":"in fact, quite deadly."},"1044":{"dur":3,"text":"So just, even though it\nmight be your favorite thing,"},"1048":{"dur":3,"text":"and this is the last jar, so is life,"},"1052":{"dur":1,"text":"so throw it out."},"1054":{"dur":4,"text":"When you fill it, you might\nget a little tomato residue"},"1059":{"dur":4,"text":"liquid or whatever, and\nso you take a paper towel,"},"1067":{"dur":3,"text":"fold it up, and get hot\nwater on it, and clean"},"1073":{"dur":4,"text":"the edge of your jar, all the way around."},"1077":{"dur":1,"text":"Make sure it's nice and clean."},"1079":{"dur":3,"text":"I like to
