just"},"342":{"dur":3,"text":"fast fashion or high street fashion\nthat's become super fast,"},"345":{"dur":3,"text":"but also the luxury industry."},"350":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the way\nthat we really, really shop;"},"353":{"dur":4,"text":"we shop in a mob, we shop in bulk\nand we buy very cheap."},"357":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, one of the things\nI really like to do"},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"is to hang around outside shops,\nmaybe not as crowded as this,"},"362":{"dur":3,"text":"and actually go through people's bags,\nwith their consent,"},"366":{"dur":4,"text":"as they come out -- I do ask first --\nand it's amazing"},"370":{"dur":4,"text":"how many people buy in bulk\nand buy duplicates these days."},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"And one of my favourite observations,"},"376":{"dur":2,"text":"although it does not say\nparticularly good things,"},"379":{"dur":4,"text":"is that a colleague of mine was watching\noutside Primark one day,"},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"or just kind of loitering nearby,"},"386":{"dur":3,"text":"and a girl came out\nwith four of these bags."},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, it could have happened\nin lots of different stores,"},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"but Primark use these paper bags,\nand it was raining,"},"394":{"dur":3,"text":"it was really, really raining,\nthe bag got completely soaked,"},"397":{"dur":3,"text":"while she was waiting for a bus,\nor whatever, and it fell apart."},"401":{"dur":3,"text":"And she just left these clothes,\nthese brand new clothes,"},"404":{"dur":2,"text":"she just left them on the pavement\nand walked off."},"407":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, my contention is that if we produce,\nif we design for landfill,"},"411":{"dur":3,"text":"if we produce clothes that are\neffectively disposable,"},"415":{"dur":3,"text":"we will all start to treat them\nlike litter."},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, I'm not saying that this also\nhappens for luxury goods,"},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"because I think if you're spending\na grand on a handbag,"},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"you're probably going to be\na little bit more careful,"},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"but the same cycle and the same churn"},"428":{"dur":3,"text":"is starting to happen\nthroughout the fashion landscape."},"431":{"dur":3,"text":"So, effectively,\nthese designers that we saw,"},"435":{"dur":3,"text":"those shiny-faced, hopeful, big prospects\nof British fashion"},"438":{"dur":4,"text":"and all round the world in fact,\nactually are in a similar churn."},"443":{"dur":3,"text":"So, they're not just doing \nthe autumn\/winter, the spring\/summer,"},"446":{"dur":3,"text":"they're also having to work\non pre-fall\/fall

people\nthat they are designing for?"},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"Who has all these yachts?"},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"462":{"dur":4,"text":"So, let's just unravel fast fashion\njust a little bit."},"467":{"dur":3,"text":"So, there are some very good points\nabout fast fashion by the way."},"470":{"dur":4,"text":"First of all, it breeds life into\na rather stagnant British high street."},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"Those of you who are\nold enough to remember"},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"will remember there was\na certain lack of choice,"},"479":{"dur":3,"text":"a certain sort of look\nthat the high street had,"},"483":{"dur":4,"text":"maybe 20-25 years ago, which wasn't\nthat appealing, wasn't that aspirational."},"488":{"dur":3,"text":"So, the high street brands\nhave really democratized style,"},"491":{"dur":1,"text":"you're able to get hold of it."},"493":{"dur":3,"text":"I remember moving to London\nand coming back to the North West,"},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"and people used to come up to me and say,\n'Oh, did you get that in London?'"},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean that doesn't happen now,\nit happens in the reverse."},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, that's how democratize\nstyle has become."},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"So, 814 million garments a year,"},"509":{"dur":5,"text":"this is also an estimate, are produced\nby Zara\/Inditex, the Spanish brand."},"515":{"dur":1,"text":"That's a lot of clothes."},"516":{"dur":3,"text":"And they have 45,000 designs,\nso their designers"},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"are constantly coming up with trends,\nevery single year."},"523":{"dur":3,"text":"Not all of those will get into store,\nbut a large proportion of them will,"},"526":{"dur":4,"text":"which shows you where this engine\nis coming from, all these micro-trends."},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"When Zara started in the UK,\nnobody understood it,"},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"because you'd go in there,\nand the consumer would say,"},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"'Well, this is nice,\nmaybe a little bit expensive.'"},"539":{"dur":3,"text":"And then they'll say,\n'I'll think about it, I'll come back.'"},"542":{"dur":2,"text":"They'll come back\nand it wouldn't be there,"},"545":{"dur":3,"text":"because shops these days don't re-stock,\nthey don't need to,"},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"because they've moved\non to the next trend."},"550":{"dur":3,"text":"If you blink, you miss it."},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"Number 3 -- I'm still doing\nthe fashion in numbers thing."},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"This is the position of Amancio Ortega\nwho owns Zara,"},"560":{"dur":4,"text":"on the international rich list.\nHe's the 3rd richest man in the world."},"565":{"dur":3,"text":"There's a lot of money\nin this fast fashion business."},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"Here's Philip Green, maybe this is where\nall the resort yacht wear is going to,"},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"because he has a yacht."},"575":{"dur":4,"text":"And this is the little picture\nof a village, somewhere in England,"},"579":{"dur":3,"text":"a whole village, that has been bought\nby Stefan Persson,"},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"who is the CEO of H&M."},"585":{"dur":3,"text":"So, that gives you some idea of the riches\nthat we're talking about."},"589":{"dur":4,"text":"I mention that, not because it's illegal\nto make money, because it's not,"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"but just to show you\na little bit of disparity,"},"596":{"dur":6,"text":"because who is the real engine\nof this fashion churn, this fashion cycle?"},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"It happens in Bangladesh."},"605":{"dur":4,"text":"It happens in other countries too,\nbut Bangladesh, 80% of the GDP"},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"is constituted by\nthe ready-made garment industry,"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's the equivalent of $20 billion."},"616":{"dur":1,"text":"So, when we talk\nabout problems there,"},"618":{"dur":4,"text":"it is not feasible for companies to cut\nand run, because, as you can see,"},"622":{"dur":4,"text":"that economy is dependent on this trade."},"626":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, I put this in, because there was\na recent power list of fashion,"},"631":{"dur":4,"text":"and I counted 4 muses in the top 30."},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, I'm not really sure\nwhat a muse does,"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"but there were four muses and there was\nno mention of the people"},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"that actually make the clothes,"},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"which I thought was\nreally, really interesting,"},"645":{"dur":4,"text":"and I think this really shines a light\non a problem in the whole industry."},"650":{"dur":4,"text":"So, there's 101 processes\nto making a garment."},"654":{"dur":5,"text":"Just 6 to 8 of those are done\nin factories like the ones in Bangladesh."},"659":{"dur":6,"text":"And these are basically\nwhat the cut, make and trim army do."},"666":{"dur":5,"text":"And by conservative estimate,\nthere's 3 million, mainly young women,"},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"who work in this cut, make and trim army,"},"674":{"dur":3,"text":"and these are the core part\nof the supply chain,"},"677":{"dur":5,"text":"when they're actually\nputting the piece together."},"683":{"dur":3,"text":"These are vast factories,\nvast, vast production lines."},"686":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, 48.5 seconds is the time\nthat it's estimated it should take"},"692":{"dur":5,"text":"one of the people on this production stage\nto actually sew a seam."},"698":{"dur":3,"text":"It's relentless, relentless work.\nThis is a quote from Ali

I'm just being pedantic."},"734":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, in 1911 we have the biggest tragedy\nin the garment sector to date."},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"And that was the Triangle Shirtwaist
