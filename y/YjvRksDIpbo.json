presentation\nfor me for two reasons."},"59":{"dur":2,"text":"One is I'm very used to\ngetting up and talking"},"62":{"dur":1,"text":"about user experience design."},"63":{"dur":0,"text":"It's my passion."},"64":{"dur":1,"text":"It's my career and my field."},"65":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm not going to talk\nmuch about it today."},"67":{"dur":1,"text":"But I do want to\nsay the books

Google, we\ncall it Google Design Sprints."},"77":{"dur":3,"text":"Very similar to the lighting\nmethod that I'm used to using."},"81":{"dur":1,"text":"And they're not\neven released

they told me not\nto point them out,"},"101":{"dur":1,"text":"so now they're going\nto be mad at me."},"105":{"dur":1,"text":"And I also want to\nsay, I love being"},"106":{"dur":1,"text":"surrounded

like,\nwelcome to my world."},"122":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm really excited\nto have you all here."},"125":{"dur":2,"text":"So today, what I'm going\nto talk about-- and again,"},"128":{"dur":1,"text":"I've never really done\na presentation before"},"130":{"dur":1,"text":"about me and my career."},"131":{"dur":2,"text":"So bear with me, first time."},"134":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going to talk about\nsomething, which I'm calling"},"137":{"dur":1,"text":"white elephant opportunities."},"139":{"dur":2,"text":"So I was trying\nto think of a way"},"141":{"dur":3,"text":"to describe a little\nbit of the path"},"144":{"dur":2,"text":"that I've taken in my career--\nfor good and for bad--"},"147":{"dur":2,"text":"and hope that it might help you."},"149":{"dur":3,"text":"So how many of you have heard\nof white elephant parties?"},"153":{"dur":0,"text":"Some of you."},"154":{"dur":0,"text":"OK, a good chunk."},"155":{"dur":1,"text":"Because I've been\nasking all week"},"156":{"dur":1,"text":"with my team and\npeople are like,"},"158":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't know what that is."},"159":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm like, uh-oh."},"161":{"dur":2,"text":"So a white elephant party,\nin case you don't know,"},"163":{"dur":1,"text":"is a party where\nyou get invited."},"164":{"dur":1,"text":"You bring a gift,\nand then there's"},"166":{"dur":3,"text":"like-- it's also called a Yankee\nswap for those New Englanders"},"169":{"dur":1,"text":"in the room."},"171":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's usually kind of\na gift that nobody wants,"},"174":{"dur":1,"text":"or some gifts that nobody wants."},"175":{"dur":2,"text":"And then it's a game where\nyou kind of like-- you can"},"178":{"dur":1,"text":"trade the gifts and you barter."},"179":{"dur":1,"text":"And you try to\nget the good ones."},"181":{"dur":3,"text":"And the ones that you don't\nwant are called white elephants."},"184":{"dur":1,"text":"In preparation for\nthis talk, I actually"},"186":{"dur":1,"text":"looked up, where\ndid that come from?"},"187":{"dur":4,"text":"And it came from the King\nof Thailand, back many,"},"192":{"dur":3,"text":"many centuries ago, used to give\nwhite elephants to the people"},"195":{"dur":1,"text":"that he did not like."},"197":{"dur":3,"text":"And the reason that he did\nwas because they were sacred."},"201":{"dur":1,"text":"It was a religious symbol."},"202":{"dur":2,"text":"And so they were very\nvaluable in a way,"},"205":{"dur":2,"text":"but they were not\nallowed to do any work."},"207":{"dur":2,"text":"So when you received\na white elephant,"},"209":{"dur":1,"text":"you had to care for it\nfor the rest of its life,"},"211":{"dur":1,"text":"but it couldn't do\nanything for you."},"213":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's where it came from."},"215":{"dur":2,"text":"So anyways, I thought I\nwould use that as an analogy"},"218":{"dur":2,"text":"to opportunities that come\nalong that are kind of unique."},"221":{"dur":3,"text":"And that maybe you\nshould not resist."},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm going to talk a\nlittle bit about that."},"226":{"dur":2,"text":"So what is a white\nelephant opportunity?"},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"So for me, it's an\nopportunity that"},"231":{"dur":4,"text":"presents itself to you that\nmight not be obvious to you."},"235":{"dur":3,"text":"It might be something\nthat scares you."},"238":{"dur":2,"text":"That you feel like, I\nwould never do that."},"240":{"dur":0,"text":"I can't do that."},"241":{"dur":2,"text":"That's like way too much for me."},"244":{"dur":2,"text":"It's something that in\naddition to those things"},"246":{"dur":2,"text":"will attract you for some\nmaybe mysterious reason."},"248":{"dur":0,"text":"Like, huh."},"249":{"dur":1,"text":"But it seems kind of cool."},"250":{"dur":1,"text":"I wish I was one of\nthose people that"},"252":{"dur":2,"text":"could do that kind of thing."},"254":{"dur":4,"text":"And you may fail at a\nwhite elephant opportunity."},"259":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's actually\na good thing."},"260":{"dur":4,"text":"So I'm going to talk a little\nbit about how some of those"},"264":{"dur":1,"text":"came for me."},"266":{"dur":2,"text":"So some of you may have\nseen this drawing before."},"269":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is kind of what\npeople think about when"},"271":{"dur":1,"text":"they think about success."},"272":{"dur":1,"text":"And you may have in\nyour heads right now--"},"274":{"dur":2,"text":"and I know I did\nmany years back,"},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"and even today-- you have\nthis kind of line in your head"},"278":{"dur":2,"text":"like, I'm going to do this,\nand then this, and then this,"},"281":{"dur":1,"text":"and then I'm going\nto be successful."},"283":{"dur":1,"text":"Yay."},"284":{"dur":1,"text":"That's not how it works."},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"So success really, first\nof all, is something"},"289":{"dur":1,"text":"that you personally define."},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"It's something that\nis very unique to you."},"293":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's going to only work when\nyou feel that it works for you."},"298":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's something that\nyou find on your own."},"302":{"dur":3,"text":"Secondly, being successful is\nabout choosing the right path"},"306":{"dur":0,"text":"and the right journey."},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"And the path of success\nusually does look a little bit"},"309":{"dur":1,"text":"like the squiggly line."},"310":{"dur":1,"text":"It's funny because\nin design-- this"},"312":{"dur":1,"text":"is the same thing with design."},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"To get to a good\ndesign, you need"},"314":{"dur":1,"text":"to go through this\ncrazy process where"},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"you might end up\nin places you never"},"318":{"dur":1,"text":"thought you were going to."},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"And a lot of those\nplaces might actually"},"322":{"dur":1,"text":"be failures in the\ntraditional sense,"},"324":{"dur":1,"text":"but they actually\nmove you forward"},"326":{"dur":4,"text":"to get to a successful\ndesign and product."},"330":{"dur":1,"text":"OK, so I'm going to talk\na little bit about me"},"332":{"dur":4,"text":"and kind of how I followed my\nwhite elephant opportunities"},"336":{"dur":1,"text":"over the course of my career."},"337":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is me when I was a kid."},"338":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm the one in the very\ninteresting-looking dress."},"342":{"dur":3,"text":"I was the oldest of four kids\nraised in southern California."},"346":{"dur":6,"text":"And my family was very Catholic\nand fairly conservative."},"352":{"dur":4,"text":"And I had my first kind of\nwhite elephant opportunity"},"357":{"dur":1,"text":"when it comes to\nmy career happened"},"358":{"dur":1,"text":"the summer after eighth grade."},"360":{"dur":1,"text":"So I was 13 years old."},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"It was around the\ntime of this picture."},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"And I went to Catholic\nelementary school"},"366":{"dur":1,"text":"and it ended in eighth grade."},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"It was K through 8."},"370":{"dur":1,"text":"And it was run by nuns."},"371":{"dur":3,"text":"And my friends and I, we\ndid not like the nuns."},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"And especially, we did\nnot like our principal."},"376":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we made a vow that\nthe day after we graduated,"},"380":{"dur":1,"text":"we were going to do something."},"381":{"dur":2,"text":"And we were going to make\nthe world a better place"},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"and fix all of the problems."},"386":{"dur":1,"text":"So we came up with this plan."},"388":{"dur":1,"text":"And it was actually\nthe night after we"},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"graduated, we all\nsnuck out of our houses"},"392":{"dur":1,"text":"and went to the school."},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"And we TPed the school."},"395":{"dur":1,"text":"Meaning that we\nthrew toilet paper"},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"rolls all over the\ntrees and the buildings."},"399":{"dur":4,"text":"And the school also happened to\nbe a church, which-- because it"},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"was Catholic."},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"It also happened to\nhave a rectory, which"},"406":{"dur":1,"text":"is where the priest slept."},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"And somehow, while we were\nthrowing toilet paper,"},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"somebody heard us and ran out."},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"And we saw them and we ran away."},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"And nobody else could be\nidentified in the dark"},"418":{"dur":4,"text":"except for me\nbecause of my hair."},"422":{"dur":1,"text":"So I got home."},"423":{"dur":1,"text":"And I snuck back in my house."},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"And I didn't know what\nwas going to happen."},"426":{"dur":1,"text":"And I thought I was\nlike totally safe."},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"And I went up to my\nbed, which I had,"},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"by the way, set up to look\nlike a sleeping person."},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"And I opened the\ndoor to my bedroom"},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"and there was my mother\nsitting on the bed."},"437":{"dur":1,"text":"And to this day,\nshe tells me God"},"439":{"dur":4,"text":"told her that she had to\ncome up and check on me."},"443":{"dur":1,"text":"So anyways, I was caught."},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"So the end of the story,\nwhich is the important part,"},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"is I was grounded for the\nentire summer that summer."},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"And I couldn't leave the house\nexcept for a 10-minute walk."},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"And I couldn't watch TV."},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"And I couldn't use the phone."},"454":{"dur":3,"text":"So I was just bored\nout of my mind."},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"And my dad was actually\na computer programmer."},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"I think I have a picture of him."},"463":{"dur":0,"text":"There he is."},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"So my dad was a programmer."},"466":{"dur":1,"text":"And he was brilliant."},"467":{"dur":3,"text":"And he knew how to build\ncomputers and program them."},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"And all over the house, we had\nthese just parts of computers"},"474":{"dur":1,"text":"and whole computers."},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"And that was back in the\nday when you could just"},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"build a computer pretty easily."},"479":{"dur":3,"text":"So that summer, I\nlearned about computers."},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"And by the end of the\nsummer, I could build them."},"485":{"dur":0,"text":"I could replace them."},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"I had motherboards\nall over my bedroom."},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"To this day, I still\nhave my little kit"},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"with all my different\nkinds of screws"},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"because it reminds me of my dad."},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"But I learned all of that."},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"And I also learned\nhow to program."},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"So by the end of the\nsummer, I had written two"},"498":{"dur":0,"text":"really cool programs."},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"One was called\nEliza, which was one"},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"of the very first sort of\nways to model natural language"},"505":{"dur":0,"text":"processing."},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"So it was this program that\nyou'd say like, how are you?"},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"And it would go, how do you\nfeel about that question?"},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"So I wrote one of those."},"514":{"dur":1,"text":"And I also wrote a game\ncalled Sneaky Snake."},"516":{"dur":0,"text":"And it was awesome."},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"So that was kind of\nthis unexpected thing."},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'd never been interested\nin it before that time."},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's my first\nwhite elephant."},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"This is me and my dad\nwhen I was in college."},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"And the next kind of white\nelephant came along in college."},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"So I decided to pursue\nelectrical engineering."},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"Anyone in here electrical\nengineering majors?"},"536":{"dur":0,"text":"Great."},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"Awesome."},"540":{"dur":1,"text":"I was lucky enough\nto get a scholarship"},"541":{"dur":3,"text":"to go to a really fabulous\nschool called Tufts University."},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"And they have a\nschool of engineering."},"547":{"dur":4,"text":"I was the only female\nin my entire class."},"552":{"dur":3,"text":"And I started taking\nelectrical engineering."},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"And a couple things\nhappened there"},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"that really kind of formed\nmy next white elephant"},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"opportunity, that some\nof them were pure luck."},"562":{"dur":6,"text":"For one thing, I did not\nlike electrical engineering."},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"And I didn't like the people\nthat were doing it, either."},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"There was all these guys\nand they had these groups."},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"And they didn't want to\ninvite me into their groups."},"576":{"dur":3,"text":"And you know, they were sitting\naround these [INAUDIBLE]."},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"Anyways."},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"I was just like, I don't\nthink this is for me."},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"What do I do?"},"584":{"dur":4,"text":"Secondly, Tufts had a new major\nthen called engineering design."},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"And so that was interesting."},"590":{"dur":1,"text":"And it was part of the\nengineering school."},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"So I started taking\nsome classes in that."},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"And I thought it was so cool."},"595":{"dur":1,"text":"And then, third."},"597":{"dur":1,"text":"Tufts required that\nevery engineering student"},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"took a class called Intro\nto Engineering Design 101."},"602":{"dur":0,"text":"So I took that."},"603":{"dur":1,"text":"It was a big class."},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"It was like 100 kids\nin it, students."},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"And they assigned\nus a design problem."},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"It was kind of\nour main challenge"},"611":{"dur":3,"text":"for the semester, which\nwas design an oil change"},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"kit for a car."},"616":{"dur":1,"text":"So I don't know\nanything about oil."},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"I've never changed\na tire or oil."},"621":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not into that stuff."},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"Don't like getting\nmy hands dirty."},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"But I thought, you know,\nI'm going to rock this one."},"627":{"dur":0,"text":"I'm going to kill it."},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was in Boston at Tufts."},"631":{"dur":1,"text":"My family was in California."},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"I didn't have any money to\nfly home for Thanksgiving."},"634":{"dur":3,"text":"So I found myself alone\non campus for a whole week"},"637":{"dur":3,"text":"and just walked around, and\ncrawled underneath cars,"},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"and did all this research\non, how does this work?"},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, it turns out\nthere's this tank."},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a little screw on\nthe bottom and you unscrew it"},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"and the oil comes out, and then\nyou pour it back in the top."},"650":{"dur":1,"text":"It's pretty simple."},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"So what happened was most\nof the students I knew,"},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"they came up with a design\nthat was like, here's a bin."},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's some\nstuff like a funnel"},"660":{"dur":1,"text":"and some gloves\nand things in it."},"662":{"dur":1,"text":"And we just put\nSaran wrap around it"},"663":{"dur":1,"text":"and here was my design."},"665":{"dur":1,"text":"So I came up with\na design that was"},"666":{"dur":1,"text":"like-- do you know\nthose Pringles"},"668":{"dur":1,"text":"cans with the little pop up?"},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"So I thought, well,\nthose are really cool."},"672":{"dur":3,"text":"So what if you shrunk one down\nto this little size like this"},"676":{"dur":3,"text":"and you put in it a big plastic\nbag that could kind of compress"},"680":{"dur":1,"text":"down that didn't melt?"},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"And I researched\nall the materials."},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"And you turned it upside\ndown and you could actually"},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"screw it on to the oil tank."},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"Then when you wanted\nto change the oil,"},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"it would be super easy."},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"You could just pop the thing\noff and the bag would fall down"},"693":{"dur":1,"text":"and all the oil would go in it."},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"And you'd just throw it out\nand put your new one on."},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"So I came up with this\ndesign and I presented it."},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"And my professors just said,\noh my god, I have never"},"702":{"dur":0,"text":"seen anything like that."},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"That was awesome."},"704":{"dur":4,"text":"And I thought, maybe\nI'm a designer."},"709":{"dur":4,"text":"So that was really one of\nmy big white elephants."},"713":{"dur":4,"text":"So this story-- this is\nactually a dialog box."},"718":{"dur":4,"text":"It's really old and\nit looks really awful."},"722":{"dur":4,"text":"So the next thing I\ndid after college was I"},"727":{"dur":1,"text":"worked for this\ncompany called CLSI."},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"It was a library\nsystems company."},"731":{"dur":1,"text":"And I really wanted\nto be an engineer,"},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"but I couldn't get a job yet\nas one, even though I knew how"},"735":{"dur":0,"text":"to program."},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"So I got a job as a customer\nsupport representative."},"738":{"dur":1,"text":"So I was answering the calls."},"740":{"dur":1,"text":"And people would call\nin with their problems."},"742":{"dur":0,"text":"It was really hard."},"743":{"dur":1,"text":"And a great job, by the way."},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"I loved it because you find out\nso much about what's going on."},"747":{"dur":1,"text":"So one day, a\nlibrarian called in"},"749":{"dur":4,"text":"and she said to me--\nshe was actually crying."},"753":{"dur":3,"text":"And it took me a while to figure\nout what the heck is going on."},"756":{"dur":1,"text":"And then eventually,\nshe told me that she"},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"was crying because she had an\nerror message up on her screen"},"760":{"dur":1,"text":"that said a child has died."},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"So for those of you that might\nnot know what that means,"},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"our product was written in Unix."},"770":{"dur":2,"text":"And in Unix, the way it\nworks is-- you guys all know."},"773":{"dur":1,"text":"So you create a process\nand it's basically"},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"a child process has terminated."},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"So I knew what that meant\nand I knew what that was."},"781":{"dur":3,"text":"But that really got me\ngoing after that call."},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"And I thought, I'm\nreally interested in why."},"787":{"dur":4,"text":"Why would we put this\nmessage up to our users?"},"791":{"dur":1,"text":"And in the meantime,\nI had been spending"},"793":{"dur":1,"text":"a lot of time upstairs\nwith the programmers"},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"because I really wanted\nto be a programmer."},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was this very\nstrange person to them"},"799":{"dur":4,"text":"because it was like this little\nblonde girl from California."},"803":{"dur":2,"text":"But I realized\nthat they actually"},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"had an opening for somebody\nto do front end development."},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"And nobody there wanted to do\nthat because that wasn't cool."},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"That's not the cool kind of\nengineering, or it wasn't."},"814":{"dur":1,"text":"By the way, that's\ncompletely a myth"},"815":{"dur":1,"text":"because front end\nengineering rocks."},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"It's awesome."},"820":{"dur":3,"text":"Anyway, so I came up\nwith this before-- I"},"823":{"dur":1,"text":"wanted to become this thing."},"824":{"dur":3,"text":"So I came up with a whole set\nof user interface guidelines."},"828":{"dur":2,"text":"And also patterns, what\nwe call today patterns"},"831":{"dur":2,"text":"about how we should\nbe presenting"},"833":{"dur":1,"text":"user interface to our users."},"834":{"dur":1,"text":"And how we should be\ntalking to our users."},"836":{"dur":1,"text":"And people were so\nexcited

I went to Google."},"861":{"dur":2,"text":"So I actually worked at\nGoogle about 10 years ago."},"864":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's when I had sort\nof my next white

role."},"913":{"dur":2,"text":"It was leading this\nvery large team of UX."},"916":{"dur":1,"text":"It was a user experience role."},"918":{"dur":2,"text":"It was taking a whole slew\nof disparate

thing."},"936":{"dur":0,"text":"But I did."},"937":{"dur":1,"text":"And I ended up getting\nan offer and I took it."},"939":{"dur":2,"text":"So this was another one of\nthose times where part of

would actually\ncome up with designs."},"1147":{"dur":2,"text":"And we would test them\ntogether, and then we"},"1149":{"dur":0,"text":"would iterate together."},"1150":{"dur":2,"text":"And there is just no better\nway to, a, learn about design."},"1153":{"dur":1,"text":"But b, sort of bring\nthese teams together"},"1155":{"dur":2,"text":"and start realizing, oh,\nthat's why we're

initially"},"1191":{"dur":1,"text":"thought-- I wasn't sure about."},"1193":{"dur":2,"text":"But what had\nhappened in the years"},"1195":{"dur":3,"text":"before that is that Larry Page\nhad decided

two."},"1279":{"dur":5,"text":"So basically, this was a\nwhite elephant opportunity."},"1285":{"dur":0,"text":"It was very scary."},"1286":{"dur":1,"text":"When I was pregnant\nwith my first

so"},"1350":{"dur":2,"text":"you can start thinking\nabout these for yourselves."},"1352":{"dur":3,"text":"So first of all, it's an\nopportunity that may arise."},"1356":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not necessarily obvious."},"1357":{"dur":1,"text":"So you need to look for them."},"1359":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's going to\nbe unique to you."},"1360":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not going to be\nsomething that everyone's"},"1362":{"dur":1,"text":"going to jump on."},"1364":{"dur":2,"text":"It may not align with your\nperception of success."},"1366":{"dur":1,"text":"So you might have this\nline in your

there."},"1373":{"dur":1,"text":"It may scare you."},"1374":{"dur":2,"text":"And your initial response\nmay be, I couldn't do that."},"1377":{"dur":0,"text":"I just couldn't do

way."},"1383":{"dur":1,"text":"So take a risk."},"1384":{"dur":2,"text":"And sometimes, they might fail."},"1386":{"dur":1,"text":"I've had plenty of those, too."},"1388":{"dur":1,"text":"And I didn't really talk\ntoo much about them."},"1389":{"dur":2,"text":"But sometimes you jump on\nsomething and it fails."},"1392":{"dur":1,"text":"That's a learning\nexperience for you."},"1394":{"dur":2,"text":"And that will move you\nalong to your next one."},"1396":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, one other thing about\nwhite elephant opportunities"},"1399":{"dur":2,"text":"is one way to sort\nof generate more"},"1402":{"dur":2,"text":"is to find them and give\nthem to other people."},"1404":{"dur":1,"text":"This is going to sound\na little bit

say, oh,\nthat's really cool."},"1419":{"dur":1,"text":"And you over here\nwould be great at that."},"1421":{"dur":1,"text":"Bing."},"1422":{"dur":3,"text":"And sometimes, people\nare like, go away."},"1426":{"dur":3,"text":"But sometimes they say,\nI've never thought of that."},"1429":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's interesting\nbecause I have"},"1430":{"dur":3,"text":"someone on my team, a

just like what\nyou did for me."},"1445":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was like, what\ndid I do for you?"},"1447":{"dur":1,"text":"And she said, well,\nyou kept pushing"},"1449":{"dur":2,"text":"me to
