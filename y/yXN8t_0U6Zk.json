the"},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"inspectorates was that they weren't\njoined up and therefore one of those"},"613":{"dur":4,"text":"recommendations was that Ofsted, as\nthe children's inspectorate, should lead"},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"multi-agency inspections."},"620":{"dur":4,"text":"What they required though was that the\nother inspectorates would contribute to"},"625":{"dur":4,"text":"those multi-agency teams and one of\nthe big issues in children's safeguard is"},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"the health contribution to safeguarding."},"632":{"dur":3,"text":"So our predecessor body, the\nHealthcare Commission and CQC"},"636":{"dur":5,"text":"subsequently had significant\ncontributions to play towards those"},"641":{"dur":3,"text":"multi-agency inspection teams,\nas did the probationary inspectorate,"},"645":{"dur":6,"text":"as did the police inspectorate because,\nfor obvious reasons, they are involved"},"651":{"dur":8,"text":"in relation to a variety of parts where\nthe criminal justice system touches the\ninspection."},"660":{"dur":4,"text":"The decision was taken by Ofsted that\nthey wanted to focus on their own work"},"664":{"dur":5,"text":"and they have stood down, for a\ntwo-year period, the multi-agency\ninspections."},"670":{"dur":8,"text":"The issue that it then leaves for us is,\nnot just us but broader interest, I

taking place\nof the health contributions to children\nsafeguarding."},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's the issue I think\nwe need to be clear about."},"695":{"dur":4,"text":"And then I think there's secondary\nquestion about, is what we do effective?"},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's, what is the function\nwe are being asked to carry out?"},"704":{"dur":3,"text":"And in carrying out that

that."},"719":{"dur":3,"text":"Meanwhile we've got an inspection\npogramme that until we change it I think"},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"we should continue with\nthat inspection programme."},"727":{"dur":1,"text":">> Thanks."},"728":{"dur":5,"text":"It does seem like an anomaly that some\nof the most vulnerable people because"},"734":{"dur":5,"text":"of their health problems are not primarily\nour concern, if I can put it that way."},"740":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's not difficult to see how that\nhas come about because of a series of"},"743":{"dur":5,"text":"reports and investigations from a\nparticular perspective, from a social care"},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"perspective, from a\ncriminal justice perspective."},"751":{"dur":5,"text":"But the fact is that the other\norganisations have different priorities\nfrom us."},"756":{"dur":4,"text":"Their expertise is\nlikely to be less than ours."},"761":{"dur":5,"text":"Their interests are likely to be\nslightly different and yet the long term"},"766":{"dur":3,"text":"consequences of some of the children\nwe're talking about may well be more"},"770":{"dur":3,"text":"dependent on what happens to their\nhealthcare than it is on what happens to"},"773":{"dur":3,"text":"some of the other agency involvements."},"777":{"dur":3,"text":"So I can see why we are in the\nposition that we are in at the moment,"},"781":{"dur":3,"text":"but it doesn't feel like a very\ncomfortable position for the future."},"784":{"dur":5,"text":"So it would be useful to know what kind\nof reconsideration of this might happen?"},"789":{"dur":3,"text":"I understand the fact that the\nCQC has a broad agenda already."},"794":{"dur":6,"text":"Whether this is likely to change,\nwhether our role will be either cut out,"},"801":{"dur":3,"text":"sort of a discrete role where we cake\na responsibility for a particular bit of the"},"805":{"dur":4,"text":"care or whether our\ninvolvement will be greater, more formal."},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"One of the complaints of agencies\non the ground, by the way, is often that"},"811":{"dur":5,"text":"Health doesn't get involved very well,\nwhere Health is not the primary agency."},"816":{"dur":5,"text":"So we're not very good at being\nsecond in this multi-agency discussion."},"822":{"dur":7,"text":"And you could argue that one of the\nways in which that

possibility of change?"},"845":{"dur":3,"text":"And the send thing is, in the meantime\nbecause there will be a meantime"},"849":{"dur":4,"text":"anyway, do we know what happens\nonce we have made recommendations,"},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"once we've shared\nthe information with Ofsted?"},"855":{"dur":1,"text":"Do we know what then happens to that?"},"857":{"dur":5,"text":"Do they report back to us on how they\ndeal with that and do we have any follow"},"862":{"dur":1,"text":"up through the local authority?"},"865":{"dur":6,"text":">> So, I think we do have a primary\nrole and the primary

to check the effectiveness of those"},"885":{"dur":4,"text":"services in safeguarding, looked after\nchildren and safeguarding children who"},"890":{"dur":2,"text":"are in need and

future inspection plans of\nboth local authorities and local children's\nsafeguarding board."},"910":{"dur":3,"text":"My personal view about\nwhere we should go with this is,"},"914":{"dur":2,"text":"I think this is a key part of our role."},"917":{"dur":4,"text":"I think it's been scoped in our role, we've\nbeen given resources to take this role\nforward."},"926":{"dur":6,"text":"Your observation Louis that many\nother agencies reflect on the absence of"},"932":{"dur":4,"text":"Health at children's safeguarding\nmeetings and I think that's one of the"},"936":{"dur":4,"text":"reasons why safeguarding\ninspections need to be multi-agency."},"941":{"dur":4,"text":"I thought Lord Layman had it right,\nthat if we're wanting people to behave in"},"946":{"dur":3,"text":"a multi-agency way at a local level\nthen the inspection of that should be"},"950":{"dur":1,"text":"multi-agency as well."},"952":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think we
