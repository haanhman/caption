think I've heard\nsome things from you"},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"to suggest that those two\nitems may not be on the table,"},"794":{"dur":2,"text":"but I wanna let you talk\nabout that in your own

that"},"825":{"dur":4,"text":"our undergraduate student body here"},"829":{"dur":4,"text":"is one third from Pell\nGrant eligible families,"},"834":{"dur":3,"text":"so families making less than 45,
