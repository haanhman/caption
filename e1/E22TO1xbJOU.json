years."},"70":{"dur":9,"text":"I mean, we have ongoing, essentially, a technology-based\ndisruption of what is a huge and stable entrenched"},"79":{"dur":1,"text":"industry."},"80":{"dur":5,"text":"So the tobacco industry is about $800 billion\nworldwide."},"85":{"dur":5,"text":"So it's a huge industry selling about six\ntrillion cigarettes to around just about 1.3"},"91":{"dur":2,"text":"billion

technology."},"110":{"dur":5,"text":"Essentially, developments in batteries mean\nthat you can now heat a liquid, create a vapor"},"116":{"dur":5,"text":"aerosol, it will deliver nicotine to the lungs\nin a way that many smokers find satisfactory"},"122":{"dur":6,"text":"without all the stuff that goes with setting\nfire to tobacco leaf and inhaling it."},"128":{"dur":6,"text":"And it's that products of combustion of organic\nleaves that do all the damage associated with"},"134":{"dur":1,"text":"smoking."},"135":{"dur":6,"text":"So the experts in the UK have assessed the\nevidence, and they would say that e-cigarettes,"},"142":{"dur":7,"text":"vapor products, are likely to be at least\n95% less risky than smoking, and probably"},"149":{"dur":5,"text":"a lot lower than that even,

will be cured."},"212":{"dur":5,"text":"And what they did was conceive of these things\nas a treatment, like nicotine replacement"},"218":{"dur":6,"text":"therapy, or Chantix, or one of those medical\nthings, in which the medical profession intervenes"},"224":{"dur":3,"text":"to give a smoker a medical thing that cures\nthem of smoking."},"228":{"dur":3,"text":"Of course, that's not what

and that's"},"259":{"dur":2,"text":"one of the reasons why they are doing it."},"262":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's all going on in the marketplace."},"265":{"dur":4,"text":"Medical professionals are not

Right."},"288":{"dur":1,"text":"Why are they so attracted to them?"},"289":{"dur":1,"text":"What are the virtues that they say?"},"291":{"dur":5,"text":"Clive: It's fascinating because I think

once."},"301":{"dur":6,"text":"It's a delivery of nicotine in a way that\nprovides a meaningful physiological effect,"},"308":{"dur":1,"text":"you know, a buzz."},"309":{"dur":2,"text":"It replicates some of the throat effects."},"312":{"dur":1,"text":"It provides taste."},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"It provides warmth."},"314":{"dur":5,"text":"It provides something to have in the hands,\nbehavioral

kinds\nof objections that at least our public health"},"387":{"dur":7,"text":"community, not everyone, I mean, there are\nsome folks who are responsive to data, but"},"395":{"dur":5,"text":"there is a lot of ideology driving the resistance,\nand I'm gonna name the four basic arguments"},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"against it."},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"One is that it normalizes smoking."},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"A lot of this concern surrounds the children."},"408":{"dur":5,"text":"It normalizes smoking, it will be a gateway\nto smoking."},"413":{"dur":6,"text":"Dual use, in other words, continuing to smoke\nwhile you vape is not a good idea, and nicotine"},"420":{"dur":1,"text":"is dangerous."},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"Clive: Okay."},"423":{"dur":10,"text":"Okay, so renormalizing smoking, it's never\nbeen that obvious to me why the emergence"},"433":{"dur":4,"text":"of an alternative technology to smoking somehow\nnormalizes smoking."},"438":{"dur":5,"text":"Surely, what it does is normalize the alternative\nbehavior, which is giving up smoking by switching"},"444":{"dur":1,"text":"to vaping."},"445":{"dur":5,"text":"No one does ever provide any compelling evidence\nthat this is actually this bizarre thing."},"450":{"dur":4,"text":"When you think about it, it's a bizarre claim\nthat you launch a new product and actually"},"455":{"dur":3,"text":"what it does is increase sales and use of\nthe old product."},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"It doesn't do that."},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"It does exactly the opposite, and there's\nno evidence to support it."},"462":{"dur":5,"text":"It's just a made-up argument that has no basis\nin reality, and to be honest, it doesn't really"},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"have any basis in plausibility."},"470":{"dur":4,"text":"Adverts for e-cigarettes, marketing of e-cigarettes\nmarket e-cigarettes."},"474":{"dur":1,"text":"They market an alternative."},"478":{"dur":0,"text":"Clive: Gateway effect."},"479":{"dur":5,"text":"First of all, there are the people who talk\nabout the gateway effect."},"485":{"dur":4,"text":"When you actually say, \"Well, what exactly\ndo you mean by a gateway effect?\""},"490":{"dur":4,"text":"What you'll get is some slightly confused\nor very confused, often, things about, \"Well,"},"494":{"dur":3,"text":"they started on e-cigarettes and then they\nwent to cigarettes, okay?"},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"And that means the e-cigarettes were a gateway.\""},"500":{"dur":3,"text":"It doesn't mean that at all."},"503":{"dur":6,"text":"To understand whether there was a gateway,\nwhat you have to do is imagine a world without"},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"e-cigarettes and look at all patterns of smoking\nthere would be."},"513":{"dur":4,"text":"So some people never smoke, some people would\nsmoke."},"517":{"dur":4,"text":"And then you introduce e-cigarettes into that\nworld and those pathways all change."},"522":{"dur":5,"text":"So some people who smoke would switch to e-cigarettes\nand then maybe quit completely, and that's"},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"a gateway exit."},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"That's a good gateway."},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"Those are the gateways we want."},"533":{"dur":4,"text":"So then you have to find...to find a really\nharmful gateway, you have to find someone"},"537":{"dur":3,"text":"who would never have smoked, and bare in mind,\nit's hard to know that."},"541":{"dur":3,"text":"They have to then switch to e-cigarettes,\nwhich does them a bit of harm that they wouldn't"},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"have done to themselves otherwise."},"548":{"dur":4,"text":"And then they have to move on and graduate\nto the big harm, which is smoking."},"552":{"dur":4,"text":"So finding people that have gone down that\npathway is extremely difficult."},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"No one can really produce the people that\nhave done that."},"560":{"dur":5,"text":"None of the studies really do show that, and\nnone of them are set up to do that kind of"},"566":{"dur":4,"text":"follow-up work or to measure people as they\nprogress through these things."},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"So what happens is that people overclaim on\ngateway effects."},"574":{"dur":5,"text":"They find associations between vaping and\nsmoking and then they conclude that the vaping"},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"is causing the smoking."},"582":{"dur":4,"text":"What is much more likely, though, is that\nthe same things that incline people to smoke"},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"are the same things that incline them to vape."},"588":{"dur":4,"text":"In other words, there are same personality\ncharacteristics that cause the two things"},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"to happen."},"594":{"dur":5,"text":"And if they take up vaping and they would\nhave otherwise smoked, it's a benefit to them."},"599":{"dur":4,"text":"So I don't think there's anything in the gateway\neffect, and when the Royal College of Physicians"},"603":{"dur":4,"text":"look to this, and Public Health England, they\nsaid, \"First of all, the concept's so woolily"},"608":{"dur":1,"text":"defined, it shouldn't even be used.\""},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"And certainly, there's no evidence to suggest\nthat's happening on a meaningful scale."},"613":{"dur":4,"text":"Sally: Yeah, and the epidemiology certainly\nbears that out in that there are fewer and"},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"fewer teens who are smoking."},"621":{"dur":1,"text":"So if there were..."},"622":{"dur":1,"text":"That's the big story."},"624":{"dur":3,"text":"If there was a gateway effect, where are all\nthe people who are emerging the other side"},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"of the gate?"},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: Right, exactly."},"629":{"dur":1,"text":"Clive: You know, they're not there."},"630":{"dur":6,"text":"In fact, teenage smoking is falling to the\nlowest levels and at the fastest rate in history,"},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"coinciding with the rise of vaping."},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"So it suggests that if there's a gateway,\nit's an exit, not an entry to smoking."},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"The other one was dual use."},"645":{"dur":1,"text":"Clive: Okay."},"646":{"dur":5,"text":"So dual use, it's odd that people think that\ndual use is a bad thing."},"652":{"dur":5,"text":"If somebody starts using a different product\ninstead of smoking, there are a number of"},"657":{"dur":1,"text":"good things that could come out of that."},"659":{"dur":4,"text":"First of all, if they carry on, then their\nrisk is likely to be reduced."},"663":{"dur":4,"text":"Some of the health effects of smoking are\nproportional to exposure."},"668":{"dur":1,"text":"And therefore, if you reduce your exposure..."},"669":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: You have the respiratory effects."},"670":{"dur":1,"text":"Clive: Yeah, exactly."},"671":{"dur":1,"text":"And actually, cancer effects as well."},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"Sally: But the cardiovascular, we're not so\nsure."},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"Clive: Cardiovascular, there's some doubt\nabout where there's non-linear effects and"},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"so on, so there may not such a benefit there."},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"But hell, respiratory cancer, that's something."},"682":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: That's huge."},"683":{"dur":5,"text":"Clive: Then it's the argument that actually\nmany...you have to look at this dynamically."},"689":{"dur":5,"text":"So if you just take a snapshot, you may be\nmissing the fact that people are on a lengthy"},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"transition."},"695":{"dur":4,"text":"They're going from being 100% smokers and\nthey're gradually shifting through dual use"},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"to not smoking at all, or smoking on an occasional\nbasis."},"704":{"dur":5,"text":"And then the final thing I think to say about\ndual use is it's not one thing."},"709":{"dur":4,"text":"You know, somebody who vapes all the time\nand then smokes a bit at the weekend when"},"713":{"dur":3,"text":"they've had a few drinks, they're not at particular\nrisk."},"717":{"dur":1,"text":"Occasional smoking isn't a big deal."},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"It's daily smoking that you need to worry\nabout."},"721":{"dur":5,"text":"And of course, they are very different to\nsomebody who smokes all the time and vapes"},"726":{"dur":3,"text":"every now when, you know, they're not allowed\nto smoke."},"729":{"dur":4,"text":"So those are two people who would both be\nclassified as dual users, but their pattern"},"734":{"dur":4,"text":"of use is completely different, that it's\nmeaningless to lump them together in a single"},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"category."},"740":{"dur":4,"text":"So you need to dive into the data to understand\nwhat's going with dual use, but it's definitely"},"744":{"dur":1,"text":"not a bad thing."},"745":{"dur":3,"text":"It's only goodness comes from dual use, no\nbadness."},"749":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: Nicotine?"},"750":{"dur":7,"text":"Clive: Well, nicotine has been studied extensively\nfor many, many years in a way in which it's"},"757":{"dur":2,"text":"consumed separate to smoking."},"760":{"dur":7,"text":"So nicotine replacement therapy patches and\ngums and smokeless tobacco, Snus, for example."},"767":{"dur":3,"text":"It's pretty clear that nicotine is not the\nharmful agent."},"770":{"dur":5,"text":"It's not completely benign, but then caffeine\nisn't completely benign either."},"776":{"dur":3,"text":"Nicotine does have some effects on the body,\nso, you know, it changes pulse rate."},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"It has effects on the cardiovascular system."},"782":{"dur":3,"text":"And what people have been doing is they'd\nbeen measuring those effects and going, \"Oh,"},"786":{"dur":1,"text":"look, something bad is happening.\""},"787":{"dur":1,"text":"But actually, that's normal."},"789":{"dur":4,"text":"Those bad things happen when people take caffeine,\nwhen people go running, when people listen"},"794":{"dur":1,"text":"to rock music."},"796":{"dur":4,"text":"You see physiological responses to these things,\nbut they don't necessarily lead to people"},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"keeling over dead with heart attacks and strokes\nin the future."},"804":{"dur":4,"text":"Sally: And they tend not...in many of these\nstudies that look at the effects of vaping,"},"808":{"dur":3,"text":"they don't compare them to cigarettes because\nthe whole keyword here is \"relative.\""},"812":{"dur":4,"text":"Clive: Well, the Surgeon General did a very\nexhaustive review of the health effects of"},"817":{"dur":4,"text":"smoking, and the conclusion of that was that\nthe things that cause cardiovascular disease"},"822":{"dur":6,"text":"in nicotine is the products of combustion\nlike carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen."},"829":{"dur":4,"text":"They're just not present in e-cigarettes because\nthere's no combustion."},"833":{"dur":7,"text":"So I think they're trying to argue that nicotine\nis a harmful agent because it's integral to"},"841":{"dur":1,"text":"the product."},"842":{"dur":5,"text":"You obviously can't take it out or it's no\nlonger a substitute, but we've never heard"},"847":{"dur":2,"text":"in the past about passive nicotine exposure."},"850":{"dur":5,"text":"We've never really had the emphasis on nicotine\nas the harmful agent until now."},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"And the truth is it's not completely benign."},"858":{"dur":7,"text":"There may be issues for pregnant women or\nfor teenagers, but in all circumstances, it's"},"865":{"dur":4,"text":"better to take nicotine from an e-cigarette\nthan nicotine from a cigarette."},"870":{"dur":1,"text":"Absolutely no question."},"871":{"dur":2,"text":"Whether you're pregnant, whether you're four\nyears old."},"873":{"dur":1,"text":"That is always an improvement."},"875":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: Right."},"876":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'm just gonna add one more, which is\nflavors."},"880":{"dur":1,"text":"That's a big issue."},"881":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a way to lure children."},"883":{"dur":1,"text":"Clive: Yeah."},"884":{"dur":4,"text":"Flavors have been seen as the problem issue."},"889":{"dur":3,"text":"Of course, people say, \"Well, just ban flavors.\""},"893":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, if you're gonna ban flavors, you're\nbanning the product because all e-cigarettes"},"896":{"dur":2,"text":"use flavors of one form or another."},"898":{"dur":3,"text":"Sometimes it's a tobacco flavor, but it's\nstill a flavoring, okay?"},"902":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, the flavors argument is quite complicated,\nI think."},"906":{"dur":3,"text":"First of all, you'll see people that will\nsay, \"Ah, gummy bear."},"910":{"dur":3,"text":"That must be designed to appeal to kids.\""},"914":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not appealed to any kids that I know."},"916":{"dur":5,"text":"The adolescents that are vaping actually are\ntrying to do what adolescents normally do,"},"922":{"dur":1,"text":"which is try to look like adults."},"923":{"dur":4,"text":"They're not trying to do things that reinforce\ntheir childishness, which is what things like"},"928":{"dur":1,"text":"gummy bear do."},"929":{"dur":4,"text":"Most people using those sort of products are\nadults wanting a kind of retro feel."},"933":{"dur":4,"text":"They're wanting to sort of, you know, remember\ntheir childhood or whatever."},"938":{"dur":5,"text":"The second thing to say about flavors is supposing\nthey were a...sorry."},"944":{"dur":5,"text":"The second thing to say is they are very,\nvery important in the appeal to adults."},"949":{"dur":2,"text":"They are absolutely essential."},"951":{"dur":4,"text":"And if you're gonna give up on flavors, you're\nbasically going to be making the products"},"956":{"dur":4,"text":"less appealing to adults, which means fewer will\nswitch and more will relapse."},"960":{"dur":4,"text":"So there is a major price to pay if you're\ngoing to do something about flavors because"},"965":{"dur":3,"text":"that's integral to the value proposition."},"968":{"dur":4,"text":"So then you have to determine how harmful\nare flavors when it comes to young people."},"973":{"dur":3,"text":"First of all, there's very little evidence\nthat flavors are actually causing kids to"},"976":{"dur":1,"text":"vape at all."},"977":{"dur":3,"text":"They have preferences for flavors, but it's\nnot clear that it's the reason why they start"},"981":{"dur":1,"text":"vaping."},"982":{"dur":6,"text":"But even if it was, most of the kids who are\nvaping are people who would otherwise smoke"},"988":{"dur":1,"text":"or are already smokers."},"990":{"dur":3,"text":"If flavors attract them into vaping, it may\neven be a good thing."},"994":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, that's an argument you never hear reflected\non in the United States."},"998":{"dur":6,"text":"You know, attracting people to vaping when\nthey would otherwise smoke is a good thing."},"1004":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm not suggesting that, you know, you should\njust go around willy-nilly trying to track"},"1008":{"dur":7,"text":"kids to vaping, but there are public health\nconsequences with banning flavors that would"},"1015":{"dur":3,"text":"tend to increase the amount of smoking that\ngoes on."},"1019":{"dur":6,"text":"And the number of non-smokers that are attracted\nby flavors into vaping and then smoking, tiny."},"1025":{"dur":1,"text":"You can't find them."},"1026":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: Okay."},"1027":{"dur":7,"text":"So we have a product that is much safer than\ncigarettes, much less dangerous than cigarettes,"},"1035":{"dur":6,"text":"estimated as 95% less risk by the Royal College\nof Physicians, Public Health England, which"},"1041":{"dur":6,"text":"is the equivalent of our CDC here, from which\nyou would never hear such a message."},"1048":{"dur":5,"text":"In the short-term, people experience respiratory...who\nhave respiratory illnesses like asthma or"},"1053":{"dur":4,"text":"COPD actually do better."},"1058":{"dur":1,"text":"The gateway is going down."},"1060":{"dur":2,"text":"Granted, we can't say what certainty."},"1062":{"dur":4,"text":"There's a causal relationship, but at least\nit suppresses one of the bigger arguments"},"1067":{"dur":1,"text":"against it."},"1068":{"dur":6,"text":"In fact, the one that, again, the CDC is most\nconcerned about."},"1074":{"dur":5,"text":"There may be some long-term consequences of\ninhaling what's called propylene glycol for"},"1079":{"dur":4,"text":"20 years, although the consequences have not\nemerged yet."},"1084":{"dur":4,"text":"Clive: And if they do, you can do something\nabout them."},"1088":{"dur":5,"text":"The point is unlike combustion, which is essentially\nan uncontrolled reaction and you can't really"},"1094":{"dur":6,"text":"control the chemistry of what's in smoke once\nyou've had set fire to the tobacco leaf, you"},"1101":{"dur":3,"text":"can actually control what's in vapor because\nyou determine what goes into it by what you"},"1105":{"dur":1,"text":"put in."},"1106":{"dur":7,"text":"So if problems do emerge, it's a much controllable,\nmuch more stable product to engineer your"},"1113":{"dur":1,"text":"way out of difficulty."},"1114":{"dur":5,"text":"So even if ill effects do start to emerge,\nthe chance that you can do something about"},"1119":{"dur":4,"text":"them before they become of sort of epidemic\nproportions is much greater."},"1124":{"dur":8,"text":"Sally: And finally, the risk of cancer would\ndecline precipitously."},"1132":{"dur":4,"text":"This is something that it will take time,\nso we haven't seen that yet."},"1137":{"dur":5,"text":"So all these virtues, what's the problem,\nat least in the United States, and in much"},"1143":{"dur":7,"text":"of the world, actually, in

you\ncan measure that.\""},"2258":{"dur":2,"text":"You can measure that very well with a randomized\ncontrolled trial."},"2260":{"dur":1,"text":"You give some people the pill..."},"2261":{"dur":2,"text":"Sally: Yeah, because the doctor is making\nthe decision, as opposed to the consumer."},"2264":{"dur":1,"text":"Clive: Yeah."},"2265":{"dur":1,"text":"That's right."},"2266":{"dur":3,"text":"So, you know, you give them the pill, you\ngive someone else a placebo, and more or less,"},"2269":{"dur":4,"text":"you know that the people in the treatment\narm, if they get a lot better or more than"},"2274":{"dur":1,"text":"better than that game on, fine."},"2276":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay, that's good for assessing that kind\nof thing, or non-medical interventions."},"2280":{"dur":1,"text":"You make one change."},"2281":{"dur":3,"text":"You use a different method to teach reading,\nand you find that literacy rates are higher"},"2285":{"dur":1,"text":"in a classroom."},"2286":{"dur":1,"text":"Fine."},"2287":{"dur":3,"text":"As again, another subject for a randomized\ncontrolled trial."},"2290":{"dur":8,"text":"The problem with vaping is that it's a change\nhappening within a very complicated behavioral"},"2298":{"dur":1,"text":"ecosystem, okay?"},"2300":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'll just give you an example."},"2302":{"dur":6,"text":"The efficacy of vaping could...or vaping devices\ncould fall because there was a bad newspaper"},"2309":{"dur":3,"text":"article saying, \"Vaping causes harm.\""},"2312":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay?"},"2313":{"dur":2,"text":"And then people go, \"Well, I don't want to\ndo that then, so I'll give up.\""},"2315":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, it doesn't mean that the vaping device\nhas changed, but it means external behavioral"},"2320":{"dur":3,"text":"influences play a significant role."},"2323":{"dur":7,"text":"You also have things like learning, so people\nwill migrate through many devices."},"2330":{"dur":2,"text":"They'll have a period of experimentation."},"2333":{"dur":3,"text":"The way that they're using the products will\nchange overtime."},"2337":{"dur":6,"text":"The time for transition might be much longer\nthan the typical length of a randomized controlled"},"2343":{"dur":1,"text":"trial."},"2344":{"dur":7,"text":"And then finally, your point is if 80% of\npeople would like to try vaping as an alternative"},"2352":{"dur":7,"text":"to smoking, and only 5% would like to try\none of these antidepressant medications as"},"2359":{"dur":6,"text":"an alternative to smoking, that's a significant\ndifference that is captured in a randomized"},"2365":{"dur":3,"text":"controlled trial because everybody gets the\ntreatment or not."},"2368":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: Right."},"2369":{"dur":5,"text":"And especially since so many...in the real\nworld, in terms of ecological validity, so"},"2375":{"dur":4,"text":"many people approach vaping after they failed\neverything else."},"2379":{"dur":1,"text":"Clive: There's that."},"2380":{"dur":3,"text":"So the people who want to try...and they may\nnot even want to quit smoking."},"2383":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, a lot of people are coming at this\nthinking, \"Well, I smoke, but I'll try these"},"2386":{"dur":1,"text":"because it might be different.\""},"2387":{"dur":1,"text":"It's like trying a different brand."},"2389":{"dur":5,"text":"Or, \"I could use these at a time when it suites\nme, or actually I think this is quite nice."},"2394":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, I'm feeling a bit better.\""},"2396":{"dur":4,"text":"So they don't necessarily conceptualize themselves\nas quitting."},"2400":{"dur":4,"text":"They conceptualize themselves as getting the\npleasures from smoking in a different way"},"2405":{"dur":1,"text":"with less harm."},"2407":{"dur":1,"text":"That's a different

world."},"2414":{"dur":2,"text":"Clive: I think so, and nowhere in the world."},"2416":{"dur":4,"text":"We have quite detailed data in the UK now,\nbut we still ask fairly crude questions."},"2421":{"dur":1,"text":"We still..."},"2422":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Are you a smoker?"},"2423":{"dur":1,"text":"Are you a vaper?"},"2424":{"dur":1,"text":"Have you tried to

with\nsmoking and quitting."},"2439":{"dur":4,"text":"Sally: So let's get onto that, the second\noption you said, which is through a legal one."},"2444":{"dur":1,"text":"Clive: Yeah."},"2445":{"dur":8,"text":"So the FDA has been challenged in court by\nNicopure Labs and the Right to be Smoke-Free"},"2453":{"dur":9,"text":"Coalition on the basis that there are aspects\nof the way it went about making this regulation"},"2463":{"dur":2,"text":"the deeming rule that are unlawful, okay?"},"2465":{"dur":6,"text":"So it's just a form of judicial review of\nthe FDA's conduct."},"2472":{"dur":3,"text":"I think it's under the administrative practices\nact, Procedures Act."},"2475":{"dur":1,"text":"It's one of those things, anyway."},"2477":{"dur":7,"text":"Now, they are alleging, first of all, that\nFDA has massively extended the scope of its"},"2485":{"dur":4,"text":"deeming rule compared to what it's allowed\nto do under the act."},"2489":{"dur":6,"text":"So the act defines tobacco products as anything\nmade of or derived from tobacco."},"2496":{"dur":6,"text":"But the deeming rule includes things like\ndevices that are made of...and devices made"},"2502":{"dur":3,"text":"of stainless steel, batteries, software."},"2506":{"dur":6,"text":"All of these things are defined as tobacco\nproducts in the deeming rule, and therefore"},"2512":{"dur":4,"text":"have come under this pre-market tobacco authorization\nregime."},"2517":{"dur":4,"text":"And it would be very difficult for the FDA\nif they didn't do that."},"2521":{"dur":3,"text":"But what they're arguing is that, unfortunately,\nthe act doesn't give them the power to do"},"2524":{"dur":1,"text":"that."},"2525":{"dur":5,"text":"It's only tobacco products, products that\nare made or derived from tobacco designed"},"2531":{"dur":1,"text":"for human consumption."},"2532":{"dur":3,"text":"People don't consume big vaping devices."},"2536":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's one ground."},"2537":{"dur":10,"text":"The other ground is that essentially FDA hasn't\nproperly...has overstated the benefits and"},"2547":{"dur":1,"text":"understated the costs."},"2548":{"dur":5,"text":"In other words, its cost benefits analysis\nis inadequate to justify the regulation."},"2554":{"dur":3,"text":"I agree really strongly with their analysis\non that."},"2557":{"dur":2,"text":"They have hopelessly underestimated that."},"2560":{"dur":6,"text":"The only reason the costs are so low in the\nFDA, it's a paradox in a way, is the burdens"},"2566":{"dur":4,"text":"are so high, it wipes out loads of the companies\nso they never have to do the paperwork."},"2571":{"dur":4,"text":"It's a really bizarre paradox in a sense."},"2575":{"dur":6,"text":"You make the demand so great that no one even\ncontemplates taking them on."},"2581":{"dur":6,"text":"And then the final thing, I think, is a sort\nof invasion of free speech, The First Amendment"},"2588":{"dur":5,"text":"kind of provisions, in which they alleged\nthat the FDA is stopping them communicating"},"2593":{"dur":5,"text":"properly with consumers, stopping them saying\ntruthful and non-misleading things about the"},"2599":{"dur":1,"text":"product."},"2600":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: About the relative safety?"},"2602":{"dur":1,"text":"Clive: Yeah."},"2603":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean...or just factual things like it contains\nno tar."},"2604":{"dur":2,"text":"It does not produce ash, no smoke, you know."},"2607":{"dur":6,"text":"These are factual characteristics of the products\nwhich they think would be banned under the"},"2614":{"dur":4,"text":"rule, or they would need to get some special\napproval for."},"2619":{"dur":5,"text":"So truthful and non-misleading statements\nand provision of samples, which are regarded"},"2624":{"dur":2,"text":"also as a form of free speech."},"2627":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's basically the case in a nutshell."},"2629":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean, it looks very strong to me, but this\nis an area where, you know, lawyers have a"},"2634":{"dur":2,"text":"field day and sometimes the courts act politically."},"2636":{"dur":4,"text":"Sally: Well, one of the things strengthening\nit is you're a brilliant amicus that, at full"},"2641":{"dur":1,"text":"disclosure, I did sign onto that."},"2642":{"dur":1,"text":"Clive: You did?"},"2643":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes."},"2644":{"dur":1,"text":"No, it's great."},"2645":{"dur":6,"text":"So we got about 15 experts, which you're one,\nto sign up to an amicus brief, which is a"},"2652":{"dur":6,"text":"submission to the court that developed some\nof the points of legal arguments for the benefit"},"2659":{"dur":3,"text":"of the court, for the benefit of the judge\nto widen out her reading."},"2662":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, we took criticism off the cost benefits\nanalysis."},"2667":{"dur":5,"text":"We made the case that nothing much is going\nwrong and therefore FDA is putting in jeopardy"},"2673":{"dur":2,"text":"things that are going right."},"2675":{"dur":3,"text":"We made the argument that they'd overstated\nthe benefits because the things that they"},"2679":{"dur":5,"text":"were claiming weren't really benefits or already\ndone at state level."},"2685":{"dur":5,"text":"And that they grossly underestimated the risks\nof unintended consequences."},"2690":{"dur":6,"text":"And that were there any, and even if they\nwere very small, they would completely dominate"},"2696":{"dur":3,"text":"any benefits that would arise from that regulation."},"2700":{"dur":4,"text":"So you only need a small number of people\nrelapsing to smoking or not quitting."},"2704":{"dur":6,"text":"And because of the high value placed on life\nin these cost-benefit analyses, essentially"},"2711":{"dur":5,"text":"the whole cost-benefit analysis is blown apart,\nand they have not done any sensitivity analysis"},"2717":{"dur":4,"text":"on that, and they've not recognized that those\nare quite realistic dangers."},"2721":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: Right."},"2722":{"dur":5,"text":"So if availability and innovation were suppressed,\nthat could lead to more death."},"2727":{"dur":1,"text":"Clive: Yeah."},"2728":{"dur":6,"text":"If the consequence of taking 90% of the market\nout, reducing the piece of innovation, greatly"},"2735":{"dur":5,"text":"reducing the diversity and personalization\nmeans that there are more smokers than there"},"2740":{"dur":1,"text":"otherwise have been."},"2741":{"dur":5,"text":"That's a detriment that you ought to count\nin the cost-benefit analysis at cost."},"2747":{"dur":5,"text":"And as it turns out, those changes in smoking\nprevalence don't have to be very large before"},"2753":{"dur":4,"text":"you get enormous costs mounting up in the\ncost-benefit analysis."},"2757":{"dur":6,"text":"Sally: Can we end on an optimistic note?"},"2763":{"dur":1,"text":"That's the hardest question I asked."},"2765":{"dur":6,"text":"Clive: Well, there is...it's difficult to\nbe optimistic, to be honest."},"2771":{"dur":4,"text":"While we still have the public health community\nwho've made terrible judgments about this"},"2776":{"dur":4,"text":"with a lock on the democrats in congress,\nthat is going to be difficult."},"2781":{"dur":1,"text":"There are signs of light."},"2782":{"dur":3,"text":"Not all democrats are looking at this in the\nsame way, and I think there might be some"},"2786":{"dur":5,"text":"who want to take a more open-minded approach\nand see the public health benefits."},"2791":{"dur":4,"text":"There is more and more public health people\nwilling to say, like we do, that this is actually"},"2796":{"dur":1,"text":"a good thing."},"2797":{"dur":1,"text":"It's an opportunity, not a threat."},"2798":{"dur":4,"text":"So that might weaken that stance."},"2802":{"dur":7,"text":"There is a way to get what everybody wants,\nand that's a reason to be optimistic, which"},"2810":{"dur":3,"text":"is a proportionate non-discriminatory approach\nto regulation."},"2813":{"dur":6,"text":"It's a reasonably light touch that focuses\non the use of standards that are applicable"},"2819":{"dur":5,"text":"to all devices, much lower cost way of regulating,\nmuch lower cost for the regulator as well,"},"2825":{"dur":3,"text":"by the way, and much better for the consumers\nand the manufacturers because they know what"},"2829":{"dur":1,"text":"they're getting."},"2830":{"dur":5,"text":"And that's a framework within which people\ncan focus on innovation for consumers, rather"},"2836":{"dur":4,"text":"than innovating or spending all the technical\nresources, meeting regulatory requirements."},"2841":{"dur":6,"text":"It's possible that the legal case will succeed,\nbut, you know, that's a toss of the coin."},"2847":{"dur":1,"text":"Who knows?"},"2848":{"dur":3,"text":"Sally: So there is a good regulatory model."},"2851":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's just hope that it's adopted."},"2853":{"dur":2,"text":"Clive: Let's get busy on that."},"2855":{"dur":6,"text":"I think many of the advocates on the harm\nreduction side haven't made the reality of"},"2861":{"dur":2,"text":"that clear enough to the democrats in congress."},"2864":{"dur":6,"text":"They haven't given them reassurance that not\nwiping out the industry, which is what the"},"2871":{"dur":3,"text":"current thing will do, is the only way of\ncontrol."},"2874":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not a get-out-of-jail-free card."},"2877":{"dur":6,"text":"There is a middle ground in
