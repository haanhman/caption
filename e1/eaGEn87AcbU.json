I've got all my team through that website. Basically, with"},"567":{"dur":4,"text":"Upwork, you can post a job on the website. If you have a certain task that you"},"571":{"dur":3,"text":"outsource or your looking for someone, you post a job. You put in a"},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"title, a headline for the job and a description of what the job's about."},"579":{"dur":4,"text":"For example, if you're looking for a social media manager in your business,"},"583":{"dur":3,"text":"you post the job say, I'm looking for a social media manager."},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm looking for someone who has experience with Twitter and Instagram"},"589":{"dur":5,"text":"and Facebook.

You're hiring them through the"},"681":{"dur":4,"text":"website and so they take a fee from what you pay the"},"686":{"dur":4,"text":"freelancer and stuff like that. The benefit of using a website like Upwork"},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"is number 1, they have what's called a work diary."},"693":{"dur":3,"text":"If you're paying someone on an hourly basis, the work diary will take a"},"696":{"dur":5,"text":"screenshot of that persons screen and their activity every 5 to 10 minutes."},"702":{"dur":4,"text":"Every 10 minutes you're able to see their screen. You can see their activity"},"706":{"dur":3,"text":"level and see if they're actually doing the work that they're billing you for."},"709":{"dur":3,"text":"That's very valuable because oftentimes when you hire an employee"},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"and you're not there, their virtual, you can't see what they're doing."},"716":{"dur":5,"text":"They're billing you for hours in their time but you"},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"can't go to see if they're actually doing the work that you said. Upwork"},"725":{"dur":3,"text":"gives you a feature to look at the work diary and see the work that"},"728":{"dur":0,"text":"they're doing."},"729":{"dur":5,"text":"Also, Upwork acts as a third party to help protect you as the employer."},"735":{"dur":3,"text":"For example, if there's any issues that you might have with your employee, which"},"738":{"dur":4,"text":"everybody faces at some point when you have employees.

Reported him to Upwork. Upwork took immediate action. Suspended him from"},"766":{"dur":3,"text":"Reversed payments that I'd paid to him so I got reimbursed payments as well."},"771":{"dur":3,"text":"Sure enough it got sorted out. Also Upwork's great because your"},"774":{"dur":3,"text":"freelancers, the employees you hire, they don't want to jeopardize their"},"778":{"dur":3,"text":"relationship with Upwork.

I just find the peace of mind, everything has been"},"802":{"dur":1,"text":"really great."},"803":{"dur":3,"text":"Upwork is a great site for that. I'll have a link below."},"807":{"dur":3,"text":"Elance.com is another great one, similar to Upwork."},"810":{"dur":3,"text":"There's other sites as well, I'm not too familiar with, but there's like"},"813":{"dur":5,"text":"Freelancer.com.
