the\nlanguages - that reminded us of something"},"426":{"dur":5,"text":"that had already happened in our past - Israel's\npast."},"431":{"dur":3,"text":"Because there was an event in which

divided into seventy different\nlanguages representative of the seventy nations"},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"in Genesis ten."},"493":{"dur":6,"text":"The idea was that God communicated on that\nday the law so that everyone in their own"},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"language heard it."},"501":{"dur":6,"text":"So we knew that God was making an obvious\ncomparison to us."},"508":{"dur":5,"text":"And that was significant, because the day\nat Pentecost - a very important feast that"},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"took place seven weeks after Passover."},"516":{"dur":5,"text":"It originally celebrated the wheat

exactly what God was saying to\nus, because you see when God gave the law"},"538":{"dur":6,"text":"to Moses at Sinai, he was making a covenant\nwith the people of Israel."},"545":{"dur":4,"text":"And so when the same things happened on this\nday at Pentecost, we realized that God was"},"549":{"dur":6,"text":"making a new covenant not just with his people\nIsrael, but with everyone who would call on"},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"the name of Jesus."},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"We got that from Jesus himself on the night\nbefore he went to the cross."},"561":{"dur":4,"text":"He said with his body and blood he was making\na new covenant with us."},"566":{"dur":5,"text":"But that really wasn't a surprise to us, because\nthe prophets hundreds of years before had"},"571":{"dur":4,"text":"told us that God in fact was going to make\na brand new covenant with us."},"575":{"dur":4,"text":"For example, Jeremiah wrote these words: \"The\ndays are coming,\" declares the Lord, \"when"},"580":{"dur":4,"text":"I will make a new covenant with the people\nof Israel and with the people of Judah."},"584":{"dur":3,"text":"it will not be like the covenant I made with\ntheir

so much that they even\naccused some of us of being drunk."},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"It was only nine o'clock in the morning."},"678":{"dur":1,"text":"We weren't drunk."},"679":{"dur":1,"text":"I knew exactly what was happening."},"681":{"dur":4,"text":"The Holy Spirit had shown up and was doing\nsomething incredible."},"685":{"dur":5,"text":"And so, I knew I had to say something."},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"I knew I had to speak."},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"So I stood up and I started to speak."},"696":{"dur":5,"text":"Now if I was going to make any sense of what\nwas happening in that day to my Jewish friends,"},"702":{"dur":5,"text":"I would have to connect it to the Scriptures\n- you call it the Old Testament."},"707":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I knew I had to do that and I did."},"711":{"dur":4,"text":"Why, the Spirit brought to my remembrance\nthe prophet Joel, well known to the people"},"716":{"dur":5,"text":"I was speaking to, because he had made a

the end result?"},"764":{"dur":3,"text":"Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord\nwill be saved."},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"I can guarantee you something."},"770":{"dur":3,"text":"The people who were listening to me on that\nday?"},"773":{"dur":3,"text":"They had missed two significant things."},"776":{"dur":8,"text":"The first thing they missed was that God had\na universal activity."},"784":{"dur":7,"text":"You see my people - they thought that God\nhad confined His activity just to us."},"791":{"dur":6,"text":"But Joel, through the inspiration of the Spirit\nsaid, no, God is going to do a work much bigger"},"798":{"dur":1,"text":"than Israel."},"799":{"dur":4,"text":"He is going to pour out His Spirit on all\nflesh - not just a few, not just some, not"},"804":{"dur":4,"text":"just my people - but all flesh."},"808":{"dur":1,"text":"They had missed that."},"809":{"dur":4,"text":"But the second thing they had missed is that\nwhen Joel said that everyone who calls on"},"814":{"dur":6,"text":"the name of the Lord will be saved - they\nhad missed in the days in which we live that"},"820":{"dur":4,"text":"that Lord was Jesus."},"825":{"dur":4,"text":"Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord,\nJesus, will be saved because Jesus is the"},"830":{"dur":6,"text":"one who saves, and the Holy Spirit had been\npoured out to point people to Jesus."},"836":{"dur":6,"text":"And so I figured if the Spirit had been poured\nout to point people to Jesus, then that's"},"842":{"dur":1,"text":"exactly what I should do."},"844":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I began to talk about Jesus."},"847":{"dur":7,"text":"I began to talk about his life - how he had\ntraveled with us for forty-two months and"},"855":{"dur":6,"text":"we had seen God confirm that this Jesus was\nGod because he did things that only God could"},"862":{"dur":4,"text":"do and he said things that only God could\nsay."},"866":{"dur":1,"text":"And I knew he was God."},"868":{"dur":4,"text":"You might remember at Caesarea Philippi that\nI confessed that Jesus was the Christ - the"},"872":{"dur":2,"text":"Son of God."},"875":{"dur":2,"text":"We knew that he was God."},"877":{"dur":1,"text":"God had verified that."},"879":{"dur":3,"text":"But my people had missed that."},"883":{"dur":4,"text":"And I know they missed it because they had\njust, a few weeks before, called for his death"},"888":{"dur":3,"text":"and so I had to talk about his death."},"891":{"dur":4,"text":"You see my people had made sure that this\nJesus was dead."},"896":{"dur":4,"text":"And they sealed and guarded the tomb to make\nsure that he stayed dead."},"901":{"dur":6,"text":"That's funny to me, because there was no way\nany grave could hold the Son of God."},"907":{"dur":5,"text":"And God made sure of that by raising Jesus\nfrom the dead."},"913":{"dur":3,"text":"And we know that was so because we saw the\nempty tomb."},"916":{"dur":3,"text":"And we know that was so because we saw the\nresurrected

alive."},"927":{"dur":6,"text":"And that shouldn't have been a surprise to\nanyone because our beloved King David acting"},"933":{"dur":3,"text":"as a prophet actually talked about

grave because they're resurrected."},"973":{"dur":5,"text":"And my goodness, I was very clear to point\nout to everyone, even though it was obvious,"},"979":{"dur":2,"text":"there is no way David was talking about himself."},"981":{"dur":5,"text":"I mean, for heavens sake, when I was in the\nupper room, I was standing over the tomb of"},"987":{"dur":1,"text":"David."},"988":{"dur":3,"text":"I literally pointed down and said you know\nDavid is dead."},"992":{"dur":2,"text":"His bones are right there."},"994":{"dur":3,"text":"He's talking about the Messiah."},"998":{"dur":6,"text":"He's talking about how the Messiah will die\nbut God will raise him up."},"1004":{"dur":1,"text":"And he had!"},"1006":{"dur":2,"text":"But he didn't stop there."},"1008":{"dur":5,"text":"God not only raised his Son from the dead,\nhe also exalted him to the right hand until"},"1014":{"dur":2,"text":"he conquers every foe."},"1016":{"dur":2,"text":"David had said that, too."},"1018":{"dur":8,"text":"The Lord said to my lord: \"Sit at my right\nhand until I make your enemies a footstool"},"1027":{"dur":2,"text":"for your feet.\""},"1030":{"dur":4,"text":"Well I said a lot of things that day and you\ndon't need to hear them all."},"1034":{"dur":7,"text":"But I hear you're big on a big idea - kind\nof something to wrap your minds around."},"1041":{"dur":6,"text":"So here's my concluding point - here's what\nI said to them: \"Therefore let all Israel"},"1047":{"dur":9,"text":"be assured of this: God has made this Jesus,\nwhom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah.\""},"1056":{"dur":2,"text":"That's what I told them."},"1058":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'm going to tell you something else."},"1061":{"dur":2,"text":"It hit them pretty hard."},"1063":{"dur":5,"text":"Because this Lord and this Messiah, they had\njust crucified him."},"1069":{"dur":1,"text":"And so they were cut to the heart."},"1070":{"dur":2,"text":"You might use the word convicted."},"1073":{"dur":4,"text":"And that didn't surprise us either, because\nagain one of the last things that Jesus said"},"1078":{"dur":4,"text":"before he went back to the

world to be in the wrong\nabout sin and righteousness and judgment about"},"1090":{"dur":3,"text":"sin, because people do not believe in me.\""},"1093":{"dur":6,"text":"The one sin that separates people forever\nfrom God is that they don't believe in Jesus,"},"1099":{"dur":8,"text":"and so the activity of the Spirit was directing\npeople to Jesus."},"1107":{"dur":5,"text":"So convicted in the heart were they that they\nasked me what they should do."},"1113":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I told them."},"1115":{"dur":7,"text":"They should repent and be baptized, every\none of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for"},"1122":{"dur":1,"text":"the forgiveness of your sins."},"1124":{"dur":3,"text":"And you will receive the gift of the Holy\nSpirit."},"1128":{"dur":6,"text":"So I told them to repent, to change their\nminds about Jesus."},"1134":{"dur":5,"text":"The one that they thought was worthy of death\nis really worthy of worship."},"1140":{"dur":5,"text":"And I told them that they ought to be baptized\n- to place themselves under the water as a"},"1145":{"dur":7,"text":"means of identifying themselves with Jesus\nas their Savior and Lord."},"1152":{"dur":6,"text":"Well, the reason I told them to be baptized\nis because that's exactly what Jesus told"},"1158":{"dur":1,"text":"us to do."},"1159":{"dur":5,"text":"In fact, in what you know as the Great Commission\nhe had said this: \"Go and make disciples of"},"1164":{"dur":5,"text":"all nations, baptizing them in the name of\nthe Father and of the Son and of the Spirit,"},"1169":{"dur":2,"text":"and teaching them to

that\nday."},"1217":{"dur":4,"text":"Over three thousand people came to Christ."},"1222":{"dur":4,"text":"It was rather remarkable that at nine o'clock\nin the morning there were a hundred and twenty"},"1226":{"dur":3,"text":"of us who claimed the name of Jesus."},"1230":{"dur":4,"text":"By the end of the day, why I guess this room\ncouldn't fill them all."},"1235":{"dur":1,"text":"It went
