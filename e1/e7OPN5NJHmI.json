just talk to each other."},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"So please, do give it a shot."},"400":{"dur":1,"text":"So what have you\ngot lined up today?"},"402":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, we are doing

reflection."},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"That is my aim."},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"We can see today that\nwe've got about 46%."},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"So just under half\nof students doing"},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"FASS arts and social sciences."},"451":{"dur":3,"text":"And 32% doing science, or\nSTEM subjects, as well."},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's always\ngood for us to

session."},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"And I want to know\nabout your background"},"492":{"dur":0,"text":"in critical thinking."},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think everyone's\ngoing to say, well,"},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"how come you're here talking\nto us today about this?"},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"Why is this so important?"},"499":{"dur":1,"text":"JOHN BUTCHER: Well,\nit's really important"},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"because I think what you\nand the rest of the speakers"},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"are doing today is\nsomething terribly"},"505":{"dur":1,"text":"revolutionary in\nhigher education."},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"There's no food at\nthe studio at all."},"509":{"dur":1,"text":"JOHN BUTCHER: No, I\nhaven't been bribed."},"511":{"dur":3,"text":"This is because I\nthink for many years,"},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"academics have realised\nthe importance of critical"},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"We use it when we assess\nstudents' work, particularly"},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"in the higher bandings."},"522":{"dur":3,"text":"But I think we've been very\npoor about communicating"},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"the importance of critical\nthinking to our students."},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think this is kind of\nlevelling the playing field,"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"making things a bit\nmore transparent."},"532":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm here because I\nrecall critical thinking"},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"being really hard."},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"This is a difficult challenge."},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"I managed to enjoy\nand I did enjoy"},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"a degree in English and history\nand an MA in Victorian studies"},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"without really becoming a\ncritical thinker at all."},"549":{"dur":4,"text":"It wasn't until I did a master's\nin education and there was very"},"554":{"dur":3,"text":"clear information on the\nassessment criteria about how"},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"to get the higher grades that\nI realised the importance"},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"of critical thinking."},"562":{"dur":1,"text":"And then when I did\nmy own doctorate,"},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"it just became part of\nmy approach, really."},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"Particularly when I was doing\nthings like the literature"},"568":{"dur":3,"text":"review to put on a critical\npair of spectacles,"},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"if I can put it that way."},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"But it's not easy."},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"And it wasn't taught to me."},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"And it took me a\nlong while to get it."},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"So I hope students\nout there will really"},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"engage with this in a\nkind of very open way."},"584":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: We've only\ngot 20 minutes, John."},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"It's going to have to be\na brief helicopter view."},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"But one thing I really\nliked about what you said"},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"is that there's this idea\nthat it can be learned."},"591":{"dur":1,"text":"And also, that\nsometimes it can be"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"confusing to understand\nreally what that is all about."},"596":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'd like I ask you at home to\ncomplete our interactive tools,"},"599":{"dur":0,"text":"our widgets."},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"And we've got three that\nare going to pop up for you."},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"And we'd like to\nknow in three words,"},"604":{"dur":1,"text":"you can have two or\none if you want to."},"606":{"dur":1,"text":"Just put an x for the others."},"607":{"dur":3,"text":"In three words, what does\ncritical thinking mean to you?"},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"So just to get a snapshot view,\nI guess, of some of the things"},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"that spring to mind."},"616":{"dur":1,"text":"Also, yes or now."},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"Do you understand, or do you\nthink you understand what"},"619":{"dur":1,"text":"critical thinking is all about?"},"621":{"dur":3,"text":"And which aspects\nof the selected few"},"624":{"dur":3,"text":"that we have chosen is\nimportant in critical thinking?"},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"So have a go at those and we'll\nfeed those into the session."},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"So John, what is this idea?"},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"What is critical thinking?"},"634":{"dur":1,"text":"How would you define it?"},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"JOHN BUTCHER:\nWell, I think there"},"637":{"dur":1,"text":"are two areas to\nthink about really."},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"One is the skills\nbit of the phrase."},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"And we're talking here\nabout cognitive skills, not"},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"practical skills."},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is to do\nwith how we think."},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's been a lot of\nwork over the last few decades"},"650":{"dur":3,"text":"around notions of what's rather\npretentiously called perhaps"},"654":{"dur":4,"text":"\"metacognition,\" but is really\nthinking about thinking."},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think this is where the\nreflective element of this"},"660":{"dur":0,"text":"comes in."},"661":{"dur":4,"text":"And students being aware of\ntheir own thinking processes"},"666":{"dur":3,"text":"and becoming kind of active\nagents in that thinking."},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the opposite\nto just passively"},"671":{"dur":1,"text":"receiving information."},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"So the engagement with it\nthrough those cognitive skills"},"675":{"dur":1,"text":"is very important."},"676":{"dur":3,"text":"The second thing is, I\nguess, a kind of disposition."},"679":{"dur":6,"text":"So it's really helpful if you\nare open-minded, inquisitive,"},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"happy to take on other\npeople's points of view,"},"689":{"dur":3,"text":"and just generally\ncurious about things,"},"693":{"dur":1,"text":"curious about your studies."},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"That will get you there."},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"And then what you're\nprobably going to be doing"},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"is-- and in a sense, this is\nwhat's not critical thinking."},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"So what's not critical thinking\nis when you do your set tasks."},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"You do your thinking\nfor your OU studies,"},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"and you're really\njust reproducing"},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"what people already know."},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"You're describing things."},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"So assessors would\nalways talk about--"},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"try to analyse\nrather than describe."},"718":{"dur":4,"text":"So the analysis bit is hard, but\nit's about trying to evaluate,"},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"trying to judge different\nevidence sources."},"725":{"dur":3,"text":"And bringing evidence to\nbear on your own argument."},"729":{"dur":3,"text":"That's the quick\ndefinition, I think."},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Well, this\nis very interesting, John."},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"Because you've mentioned\na lot of things here."},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"And what's very interesting\nabout that is that when"},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"we started, before you\nsaid your first sentence,"},"741":{"dur":1,"text":"we had about 47% of\nour audience saying"},"743":{"dur":1,"text":"that they thought\nthey understood"},"744":{"dur":1,"text":"what critical thinking was."},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's rapidly declined\nas we've been talking."},"749":{"dur":1,"text":"Because you have mentioned\nquite a few points."},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"And I guess there's this\nidea about critical thinking."},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"We think, yes,\nthat's a good thing."},"755":{"dur":2,"text":"We also think, yes, it's\nabout thinking a lot."},"758":{"dur":1,"text":"But what you're\nsaying really is it's"},"759":{"dur":1,"text":"about the way in\nwhich you think."},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"And the way in which\nyou engage with things."},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"And also, the sense\nthat it's not just,"},"765":{"dur":1,"text":"I guess, dismissing things."},"767":{"dur":4,"text":"It's about how you actually use\nvarious frameworks to identify"},"771":{"dur":4,"text":"where the gaps are, where things\nare adding to other things,"},"775":{"dur":1,"text":"and how things are\npieced together."},"777":{"dur":1,"text":"JOHN BUTCHER: People can\nmisunderstand the word"},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"\"critical,\" which is
