just\u2026 it\u2019s tricky"},"325":{"dur":1,"text":"for me."},"326":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah."},"327":{"dur":7,"text":"So when I was\u2026 this all kind of came to\na head when I was in 7th grade and

really\nambitious and they wanted to go to, like,"},"343":{"dur":8,"text":"Exeter and, you know, just like these very\nchallenging academic high school programs."},"352":{"dur":5,"text":"And my teachers were concerned and so I went\nthrough a battery of tests and this is where"},"358":{"dur":4,"text":"I learned about the learning disabilities,\nbut there were also things that came out of"},"363":{"dur":5,"text":"it where I realized what my strengths were,\nand significant strengths."},"368":{"dur":7,"text":"And so what it basically was was that my,\nagain, I was in 7th grade, my math was at,"},"375":{"dur":4,"text":"like, a 4th grader\u2019s level, my spelling\nwas at a 2nd grader\u2019s level."},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"I think it still is,

challenges\nwith time and understanding spatial things"},"391":{"dur":1,"text":"as well."},"392":{"dur":7,"text":"But what came out of the test was that I am\nactually in the top 1% of the world for

learned that as I grew older\nand things became more about the big picture"},"413":{"dur":4,"text":"rather than the little details, that my mind\nwould work very well with that."},"417":{"dur":4,"text":"So the therapists were always kind of consoling\nmy parents and being like just to hang in"},"422":{"dur":3,"text":"with her, by the time she\u2019s an adult this\nis all gonna be ok."},"425":{"dur":6,"text":"It\u2019s, like, she\u2019s not gonna have to be\nputting together, I don\u2019t know, like grammatical"},"432":{"dur":3,"text":"structures and identifying the prepositions\nand identifying, you know, what the adverbs"},"436":{"dur":1,"text":"were."},"437":{"dur":3,"text":"That would be very hard for me still, but\nshe can write a story."},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, she can tell a story."},"442":{"dur":4,"text":"Like, this is\u2026 like, don\u2019t worry about\nall of that."},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"And, again, spell check."},"449":{"dur":5,"text":"So, anyway, what worked out for me with this\ntop 1% of having common sense, my best friend"},"455":{"dur":4,"text":"at the time, who is still one of my closest\nfriends, this incredible woman named Alice"},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"Levitt, and she is a genius."},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"She\u2019s like an off the charts genius, truly."},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"And she\u2026"},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"I basically did everything that she did."},"470":{"dur":4,"text":"So, like, whatever she was interested in,\nI was interested in."},"474":{"dur":6,"text":"And I admired her so much and I admired her\nintellect and her wit and her very weird interests"},"481":{"dur":5,"text":"in cinema, and\u2026 like, she got me into The\nRocky Horror Picture Show."},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"I just would really do anything that she would\ndo."},"489":{"dur":6,"text":"And she found this summer camp at Vassar,\nwhich was summer institute for the gifted"},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"where you could take college level courses."},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"And she was really at that stage in 7th grade."},"501":{"dur":5,"text":"And because she was going I was like, \u201cI\nwant to go,\u201d and my parents just kept saying,"},"506":{"dur":4,"text":"\u201cAre you sure you want to go to school in\nthe summer at a college?\u201d"},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"Like, they were really worried."},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"And I was like, \u201cNo, no, no, I wanna go\nwith Alice."},"514":{"dur":1,"text":"It\u2019s gonna be so fun.\u201d"},"516":{"dur":4,"text":"And so I remember looking at the application\nbecause they were kinda like, \u201cIf you wanna"},"520":{"dur":4,"text":"do this you need to do this by yourself, because\nyou probably won\u2019t want to do this and you\u2019ll"},"524":{"dur":3,"text":"probably wise up and quit before you actually\napply.\u201d"},"527":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I was sort of left on my own to figure\nout how to apply and I remember looking at"},"531":{"dur":5,"text":"the application and it actually said\u2026 it\nasked for transcripts, it asked for all of"},"537":{"dur":5,"text":"this, but it said that if you are in the top\n1 percentile in any area in a standardized"},"543":{"dur":4,"text":"test that\u2019s been acknowledged by the school,\nyou will gain admittance."},"547":{"dur":1,"text":"You\u2019ll get to go in."},"549":{"dur":5,"text":"And I busted out those scores from all my\ntests for learning disabilities and I was"},"554":{"dur":1,"text":"like, \u201cTop 1%!"},"556":{"dur":1,"text":"Common sense!\u201d"},"557":{"dur":7,"text":"And I got in and I ended up going several\nyears and it was wonderful."},"564":{"dur":7,"text":"And I actually did start to piece together\nthat having common sense is sort of maybe"},"572":{"dur":4,"text":"the most important thing to have in life."},"577":{"dur":5,"text":"And so I just kept kind of after going to\na, you know, a summer program for the gifted,"},"582":{"dur":4,"text":"it suddenly I was like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m one of\nthose gifted challenged people."},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"That\u2019s what I am.\u201d"},"590":{"dur":1,"text":"And it just\u2026"},"591":{"dur":4,"text":"I reconceptualized kind of everything and\nI started to believe in myself again."},"596":{"dur":3,"text":"Because when I went to school I wasn\u2019t the\nkid who was in special ed, I was the kid who"},"599":{"dur":8,"text":"was amongst these really impressive peers\nwho were all taking college courses in their"},"608":{"dur":1,"text":"free time."},"609":{"dur":1,"text":"And you probably felt inadequate."},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah."},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, I thought that I would feel inadequate."},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, not even."},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"No, I think I was a little deluded."},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"I think I\u2026"},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"I think I felt inadequate at school."},"621":{"dur":5,"text":"Yes, definitely I felt inadequate at school,\nbut when I saw that I could get admitted from"},"626":{"dur":4,"text":"that one thing I was like, \u201cI belong there.\u201d"},"631":{"dur":1,"text":"And my\u2026"},"632":{"dur":1,"text":"I just, I started feeling really confident."},"634":{"dur":9,"text":"And in 9th grade I was put in an English as\na second language class as my English class."},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"And I don\u2019t speak a second language."},"647":{"dur":5,"text":"And then by senior year I won the English\naward in my high school."},"652":{"dur":6,"text":"And so it was\u2026 there was definitely\u2026 there\nwas definitely a kind of a significant journey"},"659":{"dur":4,"text":"that happened in a very short period of time\nduring my youth."},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, it goes to show the power of recognizing\na strength."},"668":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes."},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"Something that you can do even if there are\nother areas that there are challenges, and"},"672":{"dur":3,"text":"that\u2019s why I was really interested to hear\nyou tell that story because I think so many"},"676":{"dur":3,"text":"of us can be in an environment where perhaps\nwe\u2019re not good at everything and we can"},"680":{"dur":3,"text":"start to have that self talk that we\u2019re\ndeficient, we\u2019re not good enough, we don\u2019t"},"683":{"dur":3,"text":"belong, and yet all it takes is that one discovery\nof something you are good at."},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"And I\u2019ll say, with common sense, it\u2019s\nreally funny."},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"My mom, who loves the show."},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"And, mom, I love you, she\u2019s always like,\n\u201cI wanna\u2026\u201d"},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"A, she always wants to see more funnies."},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"She wants to see me dancing more."},"699":{"dur":1,"text":"But she\u2019s like, \u201cYou know?"},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"Everything you say is really common sense,\nMarie.\u201d"},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"And I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah."},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"You\u2019re kinda right."},"705":{"dur":1,"text":"It is.\u201d"},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"So I do think it\u2019s good."},"708":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, let\u2019s fast forward a little bit."},"709":{"dur":4,"text":"Tell me about the trip that you took when\nyou were 16 with your grandma and the very"},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"important lesson she taught you playing the\nnickel slots."},"716":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes, yes, yes."},"717":{"dur":5,"text":"So my grandparents, they grew up in Oklahoma\nduring the Great Depression."},"723":{"dur":8,"text":"And my grandfather\u2019s family, they were farmers\nand my grandmother, her father was the town"},"731":{"dur":1,"text":"butcher."},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"And his name was Butch, and that was his given\nname."},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"Amazing."},"736":{"dur":1,"text":"So that was his destiny."},"737":{"dur":5,"text":"But\u2026 so they grew up in an environment where\nthey really learned about the importance of"},"743":{"dur":7,"text":"frugality and the importance of hard work\nand perseverance and that definitely impacted"},"751":{"dur":1,"text":"them significantly."},"752":{"dur":11,"text":"And so as\u2026 just in their life overall they\nwere just these very Midwestern, Zen, honorable"},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"individuals."},"765":{"dur":4,"text":"And I admired both of them so much and my\ngrandfather is still with us and I still admire"},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"him and look up to him."},"772":{"dur":5,"text":"And I would\u2026 any opportunity that I could\nget to spend time with them was something"},"777":{"dur":1,"text":"that I would just jump at."},"778":{"dur":5,"text":"So my grandmother and I in particular, we\nwere very, very, very close."},"784":{"dur":4,"text":"And when I was 16 years old, it\u2019s the age\nthat you have to be in order to legally walk"},"788":{"dur":1,"text":"the floors in Vegas."},"790":{"dur":3,"text":"You can\u2019t gamble yet, but you can actually\nbe there."},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"And my grandmother was so excited because\nshe just loved Vegas."},"796":{"dur":6,"text":"She would\u2026 her cap would be 20 dollars,\nso she would not spend more than 20 dollars"},"802":{"dur":1,"text":"there during the entire trip."},"804":{"dur":4,"text":"And she would use it all just in the nickel\nslots."},"809":{"dur":4,"text":"So she would just, yeah, she would just get\na big cup of nickels and she would play with"},"813":{"dur":1,"text":"it."},"814":{"dur":5,"text":"And I think it sort of symbolized, I think\nthe whole notion of gambling overall, symbolized"},"820":{"dur":5,"text":"sort of the industry that they had been in\nbecause they were actors and\u2026 and it\u2019s"},"826":{"dur":7,"text":"just a really kind of crazy, unwieldy, uncertain\nindustry."},"833":{"dur":7,"text":"And so basically what happened was I went\nwith them and my grandmother was playing the"},"841":{"dur":6,"text":"slot machine and she was losing and yet she\nwas still playing."},"847":{"dur":1,"text":"And she just out of nowhere\u2026"},"849":{"dur":3,"text":"I think she had the hunch that I wanted to\nbe an actor."},"852":{"dur":6,"text":"And she said to me, \u201cDo you know how many\nauditions the average working actor needs"},"858":{"dur":3,"text":"to go on typically before booking a job?\u201d"},"862":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is the average for people who are\npaying their SAG dues."},"865":{"dur":2,"text":"So they\u2019re making their living as actors."},"868":{"dur":3,"text":"And I guessed one in 10."},"871":{"dur":4,"text":"And she said to me, \u201cNo, it\u2019s 64."},"875":{"dur":3,"text":"One in 64 auditions.\u201d"},"879":{"dur":8,"text":"And it was just this clarifying moment for\nme to have an understanding of what the odds"},"888":{"dur":1,"text":"statistically were."},"890":{"dur":1,"text":"It didn\u2019t\u2026"},"891":{"dur":4,"text":"I feel like in creative businesses there\u2019s\nso much romance, it\u2019s like this person did"},"895":{"dur":4,"text":"this one thing and then they skyrocketed to\njust never ending success."},"900":{"dur":5,"text":"Or, you know, it\u2019s they did it within a\nyear, they did it within 3 months."},"906":{"dur":1,"text":"These unicorn stories."},"907":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes, unicorn stories."},"909":{"dur":5,"text":"And knowing the statistics is so grounding."},"914":{"dur":7,"text":"And so when I later when I started auditioning,\nand incidentally my grandmother had retired"},"922":{"dur":7,"text":"from acting during the child-rearing years\nwith my dad and my uncle and as the grandkids"},"929":{"dur":4,"text":"were being born she actually went back into\nacting in her sixties."},"934":{"dur":1,"text":"Love that."},"935":{"dur":1,"text":"I know."},"937":{"dur":4,"text":"And she\u2026 this is how determined she was."},"941":{"dur":4,"text":"She actually, she was counting the number\nof auditions she was going on and she got"},"945":{"dur":3,"text":"up to 100 without booking a job and then she\u2019s\nlike, \u201cOk, I\u2019m gonna start the count over"},"949":{"dur":4,"text":"at one and then we\u2019ll see if I make it to\n64.\u201d"},"953":{"dur":4,"text":"And then by 64 she did actually book a job,\nand then she had this tremendous hot streak"},"957":{"dur":2,"text":"for the last 10 years of her life."},"960":{"dur":5,"text":"So when I started auditioning after kind of,\nyou know, having an understanding of these"},"966":{"dur":6,"text":"odds and being very inspired by her stick-to-itness,\nI just started counting."},"973":{"dur":3,"text":"So one audition, 2 auditions."},"976":{"dur":4,"text":"And I promised myself I wasn\u2019t gonna get\nupset if I didn\u2019t book something before"},"981":{"dur":5,"text":"64 auditions because that would be deluded\nthinking because the reality is is that\u2019s"},"986":{"dur":1,"text":"the average."},"987":{"dur":1,"text":"And that\u2019s the average for a working actor."},"988":{"dur":1,"text":"For a working actor, a successful actor."},"989":{"dur":1,"text":"And you were just starting out."},"990":{"dur":3,"text":"Yes, and I actually said to myself also I\nwas like, you know, I think I\u2019ll do the"},"994":{"dur":1,"text":"same as my grandma."},"995":{"dur":2,"text":"I\u2019ll get up to a hundred and then start\nover again."},"997":{"dur":3,"text":"And then, you know, if I go 200 auditions\nwithout anything, I might\u2026"},"1001":{"dur":6,"text":"I might look around for some feedback and\nsee what I could maybe do differently."},"1007":{"dur":6,"text":"And it was I believe the 48th audition for\nme was\u2026"},"1014":{"dur":1,"text":"I got that job."},"1015":{"dur":7,"text":"And my agent then, who is still my agent today,\nso we\u2019ve worked together for 16 years, she"},"1022":{"dur":2,"text":"later asked me, because it was way over a\nyear."},"1025":{"dur":3,"text":"And she said, \u201cHow did you not quit?\u201d"},"1028":{"dur":3,"text":"She was like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to offend\nyou with this question,\u201d but she said, \u201cI"},"1031":{"dur":5,"text":"was really
