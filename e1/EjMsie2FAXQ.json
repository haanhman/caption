difference."},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"You can see that by in\nlarge 2012 is brighter."},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"But let's do a little bit\nof analysis on top of that."},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"So let's switch."},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's add some more code."},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the code\nwhat it looks like."},"430":{"dur":3,"text":"We're going to\nbasically instantiate"},"433":{"dur":3,"text":"the collection of all of\nthe lights at night images."},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"We're going to attach\nsome time stamps to them."},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"Then we're going to\ndo a linear regression"},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"across every pixel in the map."},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"So every pixel we're\ngoing to look back"},"447":{"dur":4,"text":"to 1992 and through present\nday and make a linear fit."},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"And then we're going to\ngo add that to the map"},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"and visualize it."},"457":{"dur":1,"text":"This is what we have."},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"So let me try and\nexplain what it"},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"is where we're looking at here."},"462":{"dur":1,"text":"We're seeing lights at night."},"464":{"dur":3,"text":"You can see where the lights\nand where they're not."},"467":{"dur":3,"text":"But the hue is now\nencoding whether the lights"},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"are increasing or decreasing."},"472":{"dur":1,"text":"The red areas are\nareas of increase,"},"474":{"dur":1,"text":"and you can see\na few places that"},"476":{"dur":1,"text":"are very strong in the red."},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"So up here we have\nPoland, for example,"},"480":{"dur":3,"text":"or all of China,\nthe southern part"},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"of India-- lots of\ninteresting places."},"487":{"dur":4,"text":"Places of blue are places where\nwe're decreasing the lights."},"491":{"dur":4,"text":"And perhaps we can zoom in\nhere to a really blue area."},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"And if we turn it\nof for a moment"},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"and you look--\nsee here's Poland."},"499":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's turn off and see\nwhere we are on the map."},"502":{"dur":3,"text":"It's this big, blue area that's\nbeen in the news recently."},"506":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is Ukraine."},"507":{"dur":4,"text":"So Ukraine is in the middle of\nPoland, Romania, and Russia,"},"511":{"dur":3,"text":"which are all showing\na lot of increase."},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"This is right on the border."},"518":{"dur":3,"text":"So lots of really interesting\nthings you can see in this map."},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"I want to zoom into\nthe United States."},"525":{"dur":1,"text":"And you'll see\nplaces where there's"},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"a lot of growth around\nthe urban areas."},"529":{"dur":3,"text":"So for example, Dallas Fort\nWorth area we see a lot of red"},"533":{"dur":1,"text":"where the lights\nhave been increasing."},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"We've been increasing\nthe urbanization--"},"538":{"dur":1,"text":"the urban footprint there."},"539":{"dur":3,"text":"And in the Northeast, we\nsee a lot of bluer areas."},"543":{"dur":1,"text":"And what's going on there?"},"544":{"dur":2,"text":"Have we really been\nlosing population?"},"547":{"dur":1,"text":"Only in a few places."},"548":{"dur":3,"text":"For example, Pittsburgh lost\na little bit of population"},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"during this time,\nbut not a whole lot."},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"Turns out what we're\nseeing here, by in large,"},"556":{"dur":4,"text":"is a side effect of energy\nefficiency and reduction"},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"of light pollution."},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you want to\nilluminate your streets"},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"and you're highways,\nyou want all the photons"},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"to be going down and\nnot so much going up."},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"So as we've been doing that\nmore and more efficiently,"},"570":{"dur":1,"text":"you can see the\nevidence from space."},"576":{"dur":1,"text":"Let me switch gears a bit."},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"So I talked about Earth\nEngine and kind of what's cool"},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"and how you can get involved\nlike very, very quickly"},"582":{"dur":1,"text":"and do some interesting stuff."},"584":{"dur":1,"text":"I want to switch\ngears and now talk"},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"about kind of the\nother team that's"},"587":{"dur":1,"text":"come together in this project."},"589":{"dur":3,"text":"So at the Carnegie

communities,"},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"around technology, around\ndata, around understanding."},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"Rebecca alluded to the\nExplorables project."},"607":{"dur":1,"text":"This is a project\nthat we're working on"},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"to try to make especially\ntime series data,"},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"whether it's perhaps time series\nimages of the planet or time"},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"series other sorts\nof things explorable"},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"and more understandable."},"619":{"dur":4,"text":"So when we got together\nand combined Explorables"},"623":{"dur":4,"text":"with what Earth Engine was\nstarting to put together,"},"627":{"dur":3,"text":"let me show you kind of\nwhat came out of that."},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going to zoom\nout of this map"},"633":{"dur":3,"text":"and make it full screen here."},"637":{"dur":3,"text":"Do you remember that the\ncloud-free mosaic that"},"640":{"dur":3,"text":"was built out of all\nthe Landsat scenes?"},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"What we've done\nhere in Earth Engine"},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"is build not one\ncloud-free mosaic,"},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"but 29 cloud-free mosaics."},"650":{"dur":4,"text":"So now we have an\nanimated map, if you will."},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"We've taken the 29, and\nwe're playing through them"},"657":{"dur":1,"text":"in a video."},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"So where kind of a normal\nGoogle Maps or Google Earth"},"661":{"dur":1,"text":"you can zoom in\nand see something,"},"663":{"dur":3,"text":"here we can zoom in\nand see it change."},"667":{"dur":6,"text":"So let's zoom in, for\nexample, to Southwestern US."},"673":{"dur":0,"text":"This is Las Vegas."},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"So you see over\nthe 29 years here,"},"682":{"dur":1,"text":"Las Vegas is growing a lot."},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"And we can zoom in even\nfurther and see kind"},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"of in great detail\nwhat's happening."},"689":{"dur":3,"text":"We can see the suburbs forming\nand expanding outwards."},"692":{"dur":3,"text":"We can see how the runways\nhave to double up here"},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"in the airport."},"699":{"dur":4,"text":"We also have pan to the\neast and look at Lake Mead."},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is the site\nof the Hoover Dam."},"705":{"dur":3,"text":"And at that same 29 years\nwhen Las Vegas is growing,"},"709":{"dur":1,"text":"Lake Mead is shrinking."},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can see this thing\nstarts off as an island,"},"713":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's not an\nisland by the end."},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can see, in\nseveral different ways,"},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"our footprint on the earth here."},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's move down to\nSouth America where"},"725":{"dur":4,"text":"we were looking at some of\nthe deforestation analysis."},"729":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's zoom in kind of as far\nas Landsat will let us go."},"733":{"dur":3,"text":"We're in the Brazilian\nstate of Rondonia."},"737":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'm going to slow down the\nanimation a little bit here."},"740":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's go to super slow here."},"742":{"dur":3,"text":"You'll see initially the\nroads all start to be built."},"745":{"dur":3,"text":"And around the roads\nthere are these farms."},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"And understand that from left to\nright here, from east to west,"},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"we're talking about\nmaybe 50 kilometers."},"753":{"dur":5,"text":"So these are big farms that are\nbeing cut out of the forest,"},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"primarily for soybean\nor for raising cattle."},"761":{"dur":3,"text":"You can see a small\ntown is forming"},"764":{"dur":4,"text":"in the middle of the image here."},"769":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's zoom out a bit."},"772":{"dur":1,"text":"So now we're seeing\nmaybe a quarter"},"774":{"dur":1,"text":"of the Brazilian\nstate of Rondonia."},"776":{"dur":1,"text":"We're going to speed back up."},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"And you can see this\nroad stretch out"},"784":{"dur":5,"text":"and how quickly this\nentire area kind of fills."},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"You can also see some\ninteresting shapes appear."},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"So now we're looking at the\nentire state of Rondonia."},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"And you'll see these\nfunny little cutout areas."},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"And we're going to get back\nto these in a little while."},"800":{"dur":2,"text":"But just keep in mind\nthat deforestation is not"},"803":{"dur":3,"text":"happening everywhere, but it's\nhappening a lot of places."},"807":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's zoom out even further."},"810":{"dur":2,"text":"Now we can clearly\nsee the Amazon River."},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"We can see a lot of\ndifferent things."},"816":{"dur":3,"text":"But if you look along the\nsouthern extent of the Amazon,"},"819":{"dur":1,"text":"you see it retreating."},"825":{"dur":3,"text":"And the scale is--\nfirst time I saw"},"829":{"dur":4,"text":"this I was blown away,\nbecause I didn't understand"},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"that if you could look at\nit from space like this,"},"836":{"dur":1,"text":"you could still\nsee it happening."},"837":{"dur":2,"text":"It's that big, what's going on."},"842":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'm going to zoom\nin to another spot."},"844":{"dur":6,"text":"So now we're at the tributaries\nto the Amazon in Bolivia."},"850":{"dur":3,"text":"And we're right off of\nthe Andes Mountains."},"854":{"dur":2,"text":"And here you see a different\nsort of thing happening."},"857":{"dur":1,"text":"Watch the rivers go."},"858":{"dur":4,"text":"These are called meanders,\nand the river is meandering."},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"And what that means is that\nas the sedimentation comes"},"865":{"dur":2,"text":"from the Andes and\ngets deposited,"},"868":{"dur":1,"text":"the river actually\nchanges its banks."},"869":{"dur":1,"text":"It moves to different places."},"871":{"dur":5,"text":"And you'll see in places\nwhere the rivers loop back so"},"877":{"dur":2,"text":"far that they meet\nthemselves and they end up"},"879":{"dur":2,"text":"orphaning these little\nringed lakes that"},"882":{"dur":1,"text":"are called oxbow lakes."},"883":{"dur":1,"text":"And if we follow this,\nwe can follow this"},"885":{"dur":5,"text":"all the way to the Amazon and\nsee this really impressive"},"890":{"dur":0,"text":"change happening."},"897":{"dur":5,"text":"Moving a little bit to the west\nhere and to be east in Bolivia"},"902":{"dur":1,"text":"and you'll see another spot."},"904":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is a spot where it's\nreally quite complicated what's"},"906":{"dur":0,"text":"going on."},"907":{"dur":1,"text":"So let me play it through\na few times faster"},"909":{"dur":1,"text":"and then I'll slow\nit down a bit."},"913":{"dur":1,"text":"So you see a lot of\ndeforestation happening."},"915":{"dur":3,"text":"You see a lot of forest\nturning into farm."},"918":{"dur":1,"text":"But this river is doing\nsomething kind of crazy."},"920":{"dur":2,"text":"You see, the river is actually\nbreaking free of its banks"},"922":{"dur":1,"text":"and going a different\npath, and then"},"924":{"dur":1,"text":"you've got a third\npath over here."},"926":{"dur":1,"text":"And if we slow it\ndown even further,"},"928":{"dur":1,"text":"you'll see as it breaks\nfree of it's path--"},"930":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going to pull back in\ntime just a little bit--"},"932":{"dur":2,"text":"so it breaks to its\nnew path, it actually"},"934":{"dur":1,"text":"floods this entire area."},"936":{"dur":3,"text":"So this area which had\nbeen farming basically"},"940":{"dur":1,"text":"got completely washed out."},"942":{"dur":1,"text":"So let's watch it again slowly."},"946":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is one of the things\nthat rivers do in areas"},"949":{"dur":1,"text":"where they're\ndepositing sedimentation"},"951":{"dur":0,"text":"over a large area."},"952":{"dur":2,"text":"So they evulse and they\nswitch between path and path,"},"955":{"dur":3,"text":"and they're basically\njust dumping"},"958":{"dur":2,"text":"sedimentation over this\nentire area over time."},"961":{"dur":3,"text":"You see the same thing\nlike in river deltas."},"965":{"dur":7,"text":"Let's look at some other things\nthat the water is doing here."},"972":{"dur":1,"text":"So we're going to\nget to Cape Cod."},"977":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the south\nend of Cape Cod."},"979":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's speed it back up."},"982":{"dur":4,"text":"What you see here is\nthe way that the beach"},"987":{"dur":1,"text":"is changing over time."},"988":{"dur":3,"text":"You'll see places where\nthings break through."},"991":{"dur":6,"text":"You'll see places where\nthe beach has rebuilt."},"997":{"dur":2,"text":"And you'll see that by in\nlarge, most of the sand"},"1000":{"dur":1,"text":"is moving towards the south."},"1007":{"dur":1,"text":"You can see similar\nsorts of things"},"1009":{"dur":2,"text":"on the outer banks\nof North

it's been shrinking."},"1047":{"dur":3,"text":"And most of the water that\nhas been historically going"},"1050":{"dur":2,"text":"into the lake is\nnow being diverted"},"1053":{"dur":1,"text":"into these agricultural areas."},"1054":{"dur":1,"text":"So you can see--\nyou know, first you"},"1056":{"dur":2,"text":"notice that the lake is\nshrinking over these 29 years,"},"1058":{"dur":2,"text":"but you can see these\nkind of green areas"},"1061":{"dur":5,"text":"around on each side, and that's\nwhere the water has been going."},"1066":{"dur":2,"text":"Because the water's\nbeen retreating,"},"1069":{"dur":3,"text":"the water becomes\nmore salty, things"},"1072":{"dur":3,"text":"like fertilizer and\npesticide concentrate,"},"1076":{"dur":4,"text":"so it becomes less and\nless good water for using."},"1080":{"dur":2,"text":"So you actually have,\nin the tributaries,"},"1083":{"dur":6,"text":"these sorts of dams being\nbuilt and new lakes being"},"1089":{"dur":2,"text":"formed to provide\nmore clean water."},"1092":{"dur":2,"text":"And of course that diverts even\nmore water from Lake Urmia."},"1094":{"dur":5,"text":"So Lake Urmia's days\nare numbered I fear."},"1100":{"dur":3,"text":"Move over to Aral Sea."},"1103":{"dur":1,"text":"Aral Sea is the\nsame sort of thing"},"1105":{"dur":2,"text":"happening, but on a\nmuch larger
