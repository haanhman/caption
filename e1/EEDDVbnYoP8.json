it's\nsorts of two different things."},"73":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, I kind of stumbled\ninto tech journalism."},"76":{"dur":2,"text":"I was a philosophy\nmajor at college."},"78":{"dur":2,"text":"So I had to find a\nway to feed myself."},"80":{"dur":2,"text":"And I had always\nwanted to be a writer,"},"83":{"dur":2,"text":"but I'd never really\nthought of being a reporter."},"85":{"dur":3,"text":"And I had graduated\nduring the dot-com boom."},"88":{"dur":1,"text":"And there were tons of jobs."},"90":{"dur":1,"text":"I wanted to live\nin San Francisco."},"91":{"dur":2,"text":"And there were tons\nof reporter jobs"},"94":{"dur":4,"text":"open for anyone who wanted to be\npaid very little and work hard."},"98":{"dur":1,"text":"So I did that."},"99":{"dur":1,"text":"And I ended up liking it."},"101":{"dur":3,"text":"I got thrown into covering\nsemiconductors and networking"},"104":{"dur":0,"text":"equipment."},"105":{"dur":2,"text":"I was working for a trade\npublication, basically,"},"107":{"dur":2,"text":"and knew nothing about\nany of the stuff."},"109":{"dur":5,"text":"So I downloaded Unix, started\nlearning about RISC chips,"},"114":{"dur":3,"text":"and then off I went."},"118":{"dur":1,"text":"The Elon thing, I\nmean, I guess it"},"119":{"dur":3,"text":"does sort of come out\nfrom that a little bit."},"123":{"dur":3,"text":"I was never the person that\ncovered consumer tech stuff"},"127":{"dur":4,"text":"and was never like\nreally into the-- I mean,"},"131":{"dur":1,"text":"I was into the\nweb, but not-- it's"},"133":{"dur":2,"text":"just never the area that I\nreally wrote about a lot."},"135":{"dur":3,"text":"I always wrote about companies\nthat actually made things"},"138":{"dur":1,"text":"and that had factories."},"139":{"dur":1,"text":"And I don't know why."},"141":{"dur":2,"text":"That's just kind of when\nI gravitated towards."},"143":{"dur":5,"text":"And so I was not like that\ninto Elon until about 2012"},"148":{"dur":1,"text":"and I did a cover story on him."},"150":{"dur":3,"text":"And when I saw Tesla's\nfactories and SpaceX factories--"},"153":{"dur":2,"text":"especially SpaceX-- I decided\nthat's what I had to do."},"156":{"dur":0,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: OK."},"157":{"dur":2,"text":"So was Elon on board\nfrom the beginning?"},"160":{"dur":1,"text":"How did that go?"},"162":{"dur":2,"text":"ASHLEE VANCE: So in 2012, I did\na \"Businessweek\" cover story"},"165":{"dur":1,"text":"on Elon."},"167":{"dur":3,"text":"And we got along pretty well."},"170":{"dur":2,"text":"I got to spend a bunch\nof time with him,"},"172":{"dur":1,"text":"going through the\nSpaceX factory."},"174":{"dur":2,"text":"We went to movie premieres\nand all this stuff."},"176":{"dur":4,"text":"And the companies\nwere very interesting."},"180":{"dur":1,"text":"And Elon was much\nmore interesting"},"182":{"dur":4,"text":"than I'd given him credit\nfor before the story."},"186":{"dur":3,"text":"I'd sort of pegged him as just\nlike a one-note techno-utopian"},"190":{"dur":2,"text":"And he turned out to be\nthis great interview."},"193":{"dur":2,"text":"He didn't have PR\nhandlers around him."},"196":{"dur":1,"text":"So you had access to him."},"197":{"dur":3,"text":"And he would answer just\nabout anything you asked him."},"201":{"dur":4,"text":"And so I decided\nthen, this is a guy"},"205":{"dur":1,"text":"I really want to write about."},"206":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'd been looking\nfor a book to do."},"208":{"dur":3,"text":"And so after I did the story,\na couple months went by."},"211":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I started to feel\nElon out about doing a book."},"214":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think I either\nsent him an email"},"217":{"dur":2,"text":"or called him on the phone."},"220":{"dur":1,"text":"And I said, this is\nwhat I want to do."},"222":{"dur":1,"text":"And he said, look,\na bunch of people"},"223":{"dur":4,"text":"have asked me in the past,\nand I'm not going to do it."},"227":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not going to\nhelp you do the book."},"229":{"dur":4,"text":"And then I went to New York,\nand I sold the book anyway."},"234":{"dur":3,"text":"And I thought I would sort of\nforce his hand a little bit."},"237":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I arranged\nanother meeting with him."},"239":{"dur":0,"text":"And I'll never forget."},"240":{"dur":2,"text":"It was on a Saturday at Tesla."},"242":{"dur":0,"text":"And I came in."},"243":{"dur":1,"text":"I was like, look,\nI've sold the book."},"244":{"dur":3,"text":"And he said, I'm still not\ngoing to cooperate with you."},"248":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I spent 18\nmonths interviewing"},"252":{"dur":0,"text":"hundreds of people."},"253":{"dur":4,"text":"I found all these SpaceX and\nTesla employees, most of whom"},"257":{"dur":0,"text":"had left."},"258":{"dur":2,"text":"All the Zip2, Paypal people\nthat he'd worked with,"},"260":{"dur":2,"text":"his ex-girlfriends,\nhis childhood friends,"},"263":{"dur":1,"text":"and all that stuff."},"264":{"dur":4,"text":"And then a lot of those\npeople would call back to Elon"},"269":{"dur":1,"text":"and say, should I\nspeak to him or not?"},"270":{"dur":1,"text":"And he was a pretty\ngood sport about it."},"272":{"dur":1,"text":"There's nobody that\nhe told not to."},"274":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I think that\nhappened enough times"},"276":{"dur":5,"text":"that after about 18 months\nof doing it, I was at home."},"282":{"dur":1,"text":"It was like 6:30 at\nnight on a weekday,"},"284":{"dur":4,"text":"and up on my caller\nID, it was Elon Musk."},"288":{"dur":1,"text":"And I picked up the phone."},"289":{"dur":3,"text":"And he said, look, I\ncan basically-- this"},"293":{"dur":1,"text":"is going to go one of two ways."},"294":{"dur":3,"text":"I can shut down all\nthese people that call me"},"297":{"dur":3,"text":"and ask whether I should\nlet them talk to you,"},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"or I could cooperate\nwith the book."},"303":{"dur":3,"text":"I was like, obviously, you\nshould choose option b."},"307":{"dur":5,"text":"And then we set up a\nmeeting to talk about it."},"312":{"dur":3,"text":"He wanted to be able\nto-- he wanted to have"},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"some control over it initially."},"317":{"dur":3,"text":"He wanted to be able to read\nthe book before it came out."},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"And then he wanted to put\nfootnotes in the book."},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you know\nanything about Elon,"},"325":{"dur":3,"text":"that would mean the footnotes\nwould be longer than the book"},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"and that the book would\nprobably never be published."},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I kind of pushed\nback on him on that."},"334":{"dur":1,"text":"I had this huge speech prepared."},"336":{"dur":3,"text":"And I got five minutes into\nit, and he just said, OK."},"339":{"dur":3,"text":"Yeah, to his credit,\nafter that, he gave me"},"343":{"dur":1,"text":"access to everybody I wanted."},"345":{"dur":3,"text":"And then he agreed to have a\nmeeting with me once a month,"},"349":{"dur":1,"text":"he said, for as long as it took."},"350":{"dur":1,"text":"It ended up being\nabout eight months."},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"And we would have three-,\nfour-, five-hour dinners."},"354":{"dur":0,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: Wow."},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"So the book, I have to say,\nespecially the beginning,"},"357":{"dur":1,"text":"it reads like a\nsuspense thriller,"},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"even though it's nonfiction\nbecause-- I don't"},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"want to give too much\naway, but it opens with you"},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"kind of showing up a little\nearly for this meeting,"},"366":{"dur":3,"text":"sitting down with a drink,\nwaiting for Elon to show up,"},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"knowing full well that this is\nkind of a make-or-break moment."},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"And it goes well, like you said."},"375":{"dur":3,"text":"I can't believe you didn't agree\nto his two demands, by the way."},"378":{"dur":1,"text":"They seemed reasonable, but--"},"380":{"dur":1,"text":"ASHLEE VANCE: There\nwas part of me"},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"that-- so Elon's got this\nvery unique writing style."},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, part of me,\nI thought it would"},"385":{"dur":5,"text":"be like a novelty to actually\nsee his thinking of some"},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"of this stuff."},"394":{"dur":3,"text":"And there was like a moment in\ntime where if he had really,"},"397":{"dur":1,"text":"really pushed on that, maybe."},"399":{"dur":3,"text":"But honestly, I could\nsee stuff in the book"},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"where it's like, oh, he had a\nturkey sandwich on this day."},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"And then it would be five\npages about why he could not"},"407":{"dur":1,"text":"have had a turkey sandwich."},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"And it had to be a ham\nsandwich because he--"},"411":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was just\ngoing to be a mess."},"414":{"dur":1,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: Fair enough."},"415":{"dur":1,"text":"So how does this\nconversation end?"},"416":{"dur":0,"text":"You get what you want."},"417":{"dur":1,"text":"How does it end?"},"418":{"dur":1,"text":"ASHLEE VANCE:\nWell, it was weird."},"420":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, the dinner went on."},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"I feel like that first one\nwas like two or three hours."},"423":{"dur":1,"text":"And it was all over the place."},"424":{"dur":3,"text":"We walked about Larry\nPage a bit and AI."},"428":{"dur":1,"text":"And then we had\nthese other things."},"430":{"dur":1,"text":"It was very Elon."},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"He's kind of like, I'm\nlooking for a PR person."},"433":{"dur":4,"text":"And they'd say, who's the\nbest PR person in the world?"},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"And the conversation went\nall these different ways."},"441":{"dur":4,"text":"And then, I'd thought he agreed\nto participate in the book."},"446":{"dur":3,"text":"And then right at the end,\nhe's kind of getting up."},"449":{"dur":1,"text":"And he stood up from\nthe table first."},"451":{"dur":3,"text":"And then he came back and he\nput both his hands on the table."},"454":{"dur":1,"text":"And he looked at me in the eye."},"455":{"dur":4,"text":"And then he said, do\nyou think I'm insane?"},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"I'd already been through\nthis whole huge test."},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"My brain is going, is this\nthe last sort of riddle?"},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"What does that mean?"},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"How am I supposed to\nanswer this question?"},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"Is this the final test to\nsee if he'll cooperate?"},"470":{"dur":3,"text":"And I remember all this stuff\nwas going through my brain"},"474":{"dur":3,"text":"so fast while he's still\nlooking at you in the eyes."},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think I just\nmumbled out something"},"479":{"dur":5,"text":"about-- it was like, no, I mean,\nI don't think you're crazy."},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"I think some of the stuff you\ndo could be perceived that way."},"488":{"dur":3,"text":"But no, I mean, I'm like\nat least into the companies"},"491":{"dur":1,"text":"or I wouldn't be doing this."},"493":{"dur":3,"text":"But ultimately I\ncame to just think--"},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't think anything I\nsaid would have mattered."},"498":{"dur":3,"text":"I think he was having\nthis one last gut"},"502":{"dur":3,"text":"check of whether I could\nbe at least quasi trusted."},"506":{"dur":1,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: Trusted, OK."},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"So if you said yes,\nI think you're crazy,"},"509":{"dur":1,"text":"you think he still would have--"},"510":{"dur":0,"text":"ASHLEE VANCE:\nYeah, I don't know."},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"I think it was a\nlooking into my eye"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"to sort of see what happened."},"515":{"dur":2,"text":"Or maybe, I also thought\nhe'd already made up his mind"},"518":{"dur":4,"text":"and he was just asking\nhimself a little bit."},"522":{"dur":0,"text":"I understand."},"523":{"dur":1,"text":"So what was the process like?"},"525":{"dur":1,"text":"You mentioned about eight\nmonths, once a month,"},"526":{"dur":0,"text":"you get together."},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"What is it like to spend\na few hours a month"},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"interviewing Elon Musk?"},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"ASHLEE VANCE: It was really fun."},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"At the beginning, it was\nnerve-wracking because I never"},"537":{"dur":1,"text":"knew how many of\nthese interviews"},"538":{"dur":1,"text":"I would actually get."},"539":{"dur":1,"text":"Even though he had\nagreed to it, I always"},"541":{"dur":3,"text":"figured that he\nmight do one and they"},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"he'd be like, OK, that's enough."},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"And then I thought he might\nget sick of it after a while"},"550":{"dur":0,"text":"and just cut me off."},"551":{"dur":4,"text":"So each one felt like\nan accomplishment."},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"But then it was frustrating\nbecause the first four,"},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"I really didn't-- I was\ngetting lots of useful stuff,"},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"but nothing that was-- I could\ntell he was still holding back"},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"And he was repeating\na lot of stories,"},"568":{"dur":3,"text":"if you watch Elon's\nspeeches and other talks,"},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"that you would\nhave heard before."},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that was frustrating."},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I'm still not\nsure exactly what happened,"},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"but around the\nfourth meeting-- we"},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"used to always do\nthe same thing."},"582":{"dur":1,"text":"We would get there."},"583":{"dur":0,"text":"He eats really late."},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"So it'd be like 8:30,\n9 o'clock at night."},"586":{"dur":3,"text":"And we would go a few times\n'til just everybody had left."},"590":{"dur":1,"text":"And it was kind of\none of those things."},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"There was like\nhardly anybody there."},"594":{"dur":3,"text":"And he just-- it was like a\nflip-- the switch flipped."},"597":{"dur":5,"text":"I think he had really\ncommitted to doing it."},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"And he became much more\nrelaxed and easygoing."},"606":{"dur":3,"text":"But on the whole, it's\nlike what I looked forward"},"609":{"dur":0,"text":"It was really fun."},"610":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean, if you consider the\nidea that he might actually"},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"be the first guy on\nMars, it was weird to be"},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"having dinner with this\nguy over and over again,"},"620":{"dur":1,"text":"and getting to ask him\nwhatever you wanted."},"622":{"dur":1,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: Very interesting."},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"So we'll talk a little bit\nabout his childhood upbringing"},"625":{"dur":0,"text":"in a moment."},"626":{"dur":1,"text":"But something that\nstuck out for me"},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"when I was reading\nthe beginning,"},"629":{"dur":1,"text":"you mentioned something\nfrom his youth."},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"I think he's in\nCanada at this point."},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"He's not even in college yet."},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not sure if he is."},"637":{"dur":1,"text":"And he's having\na birthday party."},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's the first time where\nromance appears in the book."},"642":{"dur":3,"text":"And he's sitting on this\ncouch with a young woman."},"645":{"dur":3,"text":"And one of the first\nthings he says to her is,"},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"if I didn't have\nto eat, I wouldn't."},"651":{"dur":3,"text":"If I could just\nget rid of eating"},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"and just work all the\ntime, I would just do that."},"657":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'm thinking,\nthis is the '90s."},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"This is way before\nSoylent or anything."},"661":{"dur":4,"text":"So what is it like to eat\nwith Elon Musk at 8:30?"},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"ASHLEE VANCE: Dinner with\nElon is an experience."},"667":{"dur":1,"text":"It's--"},"668":{"dur":0,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: Really?"},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"I've never been-- the\nactual act of eating."},"673":{"dur":0,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: I get it."},"674":{"dur":3,"text":"ASHLEE VANCE: I've\nnever seen anyone"},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"who eats as fast as Elon does."},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"In that first meeting,\nI didn't know how long"},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"I would have him there."},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I have my\ntape recorder on."},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"And I have my computer\non the side as well."},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"I always take notes even\nthough I'm recording."},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"It helps me to remember\nstuff and things."},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"And we're going along."},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"We ordered appetizer."},"701":{"dur":3,"text":"First of all, Elon\nhas to-- it takes"},"705":{"dur":3,"text":"him a while to figure\nout what he wants to eat."},"708":{"dur":4,"text":"I think he's used to having\na lot of this stuff taken"},"712":{"dur":1,"text":"care of for him."},"713":{"dur":1,"text":"His assistant, when I\nwould be at the office,"},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"she would just bring him food."},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"And he would just scarf it down."},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"And didn't even seem like\nhe was paying attention"},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"to what he was eating at all."},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"And when we'd go to\nthese restaurants,"},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"it was like, what\ndo you want to eat?"},"728":{"dur":1,"text":"And we would never get anywhere."},"730":{"dur":1,"text":"So I would make all\nthese decisions."},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"And we ordered a\nton of appetizers."},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"Instead of just getting one\nor two, then he would be like,"},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"let's just order\nlike six things."},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"And then I'm asking questions."},"741":{"dur":1,"text":"And he's talking."},"742":{"dur":3,"text":"So he's doing most of\ntalking, and he's still--"},"745":{"dur":1,"text":"they're just like\nall disappearing, one"},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'm like, this is\ngoing way too'fast."},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"I have to have this dinner\nlast as long as possible."},"753":{"dur":3,"text":"And they're all just-- I\nwould look down at my computer"},"757":{"dur":3,"text":"for a second and entire\nthings would just"},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"vanish with the plate."},"762":{"dur":1,"text":"And then the main courses came."},"763":{"dur":1,"text":"And the same thing\nwas happening again."},"765":{"dur":1,"text":"And I knew I was\nreally on the clock."},"767":{"dur":4,"text":"And so he had gotten\nsome sort of seafood."},"771":{"dur":3,"text":"I think it was octopus\nor squid in black ink."},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I-- Oh, no,\nit was lobster, fried,"},"777":{"dur":1,"text":"with black squid ink."},"778":{"dur":1,"text":"And then I got a steak."},"780":{"dur":1,"text":"And he'd already\nfinished his dinner."},"782":{"dur":1,"text":"And I was only two questions."},"783":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I cut off half my\nsteak and put it on his plate."},"787":{"dur":1,"text":"And I thought,\nthis will hold him."},"788":{"dur":1,"text":"It was like two bites."},"789":{"dur":1,"text":"And that was gone."},"791":{"dur":1,"text":"And then this repeated\nitself over and over."},"793":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean, I think for him\nfood really is just fuel."},"797":{"dur":1,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: I see that."},"798":{"dur":0,"text":"OK."},"799":{"dur":1,"text":"I promise we're going\nto leave this dinner"},"801":{"dur":0,"text":"after this question."},"802":{"dur":1,"text":"But one more thing came up."},"803":{"dur":2,"text":"You mentioned, I think,\nwhen we were talking before,"},"805":{"dur":2,"text":"that a few of these\ndinners, rambling,"},"808":{"dur":1,"text":"all sorts of subjects,\nbut one thing that"},"810":{"dur":2,"text":"comes up occasionally is\nElon's greatest mortal"},"812":{"dur":1,"text":"fear in the world."},"813":{"dur":3,"text":"And I wonder if you'd\nshare that with us."},"817":{"dur":4,"text":"ASHLEE VANCE: These days,\nit's AI and you guys, I think."},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, it's funny because\nhe's friends with Larry."},"823":{"dur":1,"text":"But OK, so at this\nfirst dinner, there's"},"825":{"dur":3,"text":"also like no small\ntalk with Elon."},"828":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'm coming into\nthis thing, it's"},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"like my whole life feels\nlike it's on the line."},"833":{"dur":2,"text":"I've made this huge\ngamble on this book."},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"And I have to convince\nhim to participate."},"841":{"dur":2,"text":"So I had

car."},"2107":{"dur":2,"text":"And so people would put\ndown $5,000 to get line,"},"2110":{"dur":1,"text":"but they were all\nwaiting to actually"},"2111":{"dur":3,"text":"convert that to a purchase\nuntil everything got worked out."},"2115":{"dur":3,"text":"And this was a huge\nproblem for Tesla."},"2119":{"dur":1,"text":"Because you're\nrunning a factory,"},"2121":{"dur":4,"text":"it's burning through tons of\nmoney if it's not being filled."},"2125":{"dur":4,"text":"And so it was\nbasically, I think it"},"2129":{"dur":6,"text":"was the second\nquarter of 2013, Elon"},"2135":{"dur":3,"text":"could plot out that they're\njust going to run out of money."},"2139":{"dur":1,"text":"And he was good\nfriends with Larry."},"2140":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think he

would"},"2149":{"dur":2,"text":"be sort of like into\nbuying the company,"},"2151":{"dur":3,"text":"but would see it through more\nthan maybe some other guys."},"2154":{"dur":4,"text":"And so he

think,"},"2164":{"dur":7,"text":"it was five years of time\nwithin the auspices of Google."},"2171":{"dur":2,"text":"And he wanted an\nimmediate guarantee"},"2174":{"dur":3,"text":"for-- it's in the

everything."},"2183":{"dur":2,"text":"And then this very\nElon thing happened."},"2186":{"dur":4,"text":"He basically took\neverybody in the company,"},"2191":{"dur":2,"text":"whether you were\nin HR

up."},"2217":{"dur":2,"text":"And then it became the best\nperforming stock of 2013."},"2219":{"dur":1,"text":"And so there was\nnever-- not only"},"2221":{"dur":3,"text":"did they have enough money\nto see through the quarter,"},"2225":{"dur":1,"text":"then Tesla became\nso expensive that it"},"2227":{"dur":2,"text":"was like-- I don't\neven think Google"},"2229":{"dur":1,"text":"would've

Yeah."},"2234":{"dur":6,"text":"I mean, it's a little tricky\nbecause some of the stuff"},"2240":{"dur":2,"text":"was sourced in the book, so\nthere's only so much I can

came--"},"2303":{"dur":3,"text":"your first point is the way\nI came to view the companies."},"2306":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, like the aerospace\nstuff in particular"},"2310":{"dur":1,"text":"is sort of depressing\noutside of SpaceX."},"2312":{"dur":4,"text":"I would go to launches of\nArianespace and-- I mean,"},"2316":{"dur":2,"text":"these companies\ndo amazing things."},"2318":{"dur":3,"text":"But the equipment looks\nlike it's from 1960s still."},"2322":{"dur":4,"text":"And you expect there to be\nthese kind of modern-- you just"},"2326":{"dur":1,"text":"expect it to be advanced."},"2328":{"dur":1,"text":"And it just hasn't been."},"2329":{"dur":3,"text":"And SpaceX definitely has\nput pressure on

way a\ncapsule should look."},"2340":{"dur":2,"text":"And Elon's going to come\nout with new spacesuits"},"2342":{"dur":1,"text":"soon that he says are crazy."},"2344":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, he's into\nall that stuff."},"2346":{"dur":3,"text":"And then I think that\nmodernization of Tesla's"},"2350":{"dur":1,"text":"pretty obvious, like\nbeyond the electric car"},"2352":{"dur":2,"text":"stuff, the software in the car."},"2354":{"dur":3,"text":"It's funny because people ask\nthe second part of the question"},"2357":{"dur":0,"text":"to me."},"2358":{"dur":2,"text":"Other times it's like,

run"},"2424":{"dur":3,"text":"your business, more like the\nway companies are run here,"},"2427":{"dur":2,"text":"and then the software\nethos and sort of push that"},"2430":{"dur":2,"text":"into these industries\nthat were not prepared yet"},"2432":{"dur":2,"text":"to move at that speed\nor think that way."},"2434":{"dur":5,"text":"There's examples\nin the book
