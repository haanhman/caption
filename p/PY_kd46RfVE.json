unusual,"},"21":{"dur":2,"text":"named Alice Stewart."},"23":{"dur":3,"text":"And Alice was unusual partly because, of course,"},"26":{"dur":3,"text":"she was a woman, which was pretty rare in the 1950s."},"29":{"dur":2,"text":"And she was brilliant, she was one of the,"},"32":{"dur":4,"text":"at the time, the youngest Fellow to be elected to the Royal College of Physicians."},"36":{"dur":3,"text":"She was unusual too because she continued to work after she got married,"},"40":{"dur":2,"text":"after she had kids,"},"42":{"dur":3,"text":"and even after she got divorced and was a single parent,"},"45":{"dur":2,"text":"she continued her medical work."},"48":{"dur":4,"text":"And she was unusual because she was really interested in a new science,"},"52":{"dur":2,"text":"the emerging field of epidemiology,"},"54":{"dur":3,"text":"the study of patterns in disease."},"58":{"dur":2,"text":"But like every scientist, she appreciated"},"60":{"dur":2,"text":"that to make her mark, what she needed to do"},"62":{"dur":4,"text":"was find a hard problem and solve it."},"67":{"dur":2,"text":"The hard problem that Alice chose"},"69":{"dur":3,"text":"was the rising incidence of childhood cancers."},"73":{"dur":2,"text":"Most disease is correlated with poverty,"},"75":{"dur":2,"text":"but in the case of childhood cancers,"},"77":{"dur":2,"text":"the children who were dying seemed mostly to come"},"80":{"dur":2,"text":"from affluent families."},"82":{"dur":1,"text":"So, what, she wanted to know,"},"84":{"dur":3,"text":"could explain this anomaly?"},"87":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, Alice had trouble getting funding for her research."},"90":{"dur":1,"text":"In the end, she got just 1,000 pounds"},"92":{"dur":2,"text":"from the Lady Tata Memorial prize."},"94":{"dur":2,"text":"And that meant she knew she only had one shot"},"97":{"dur":2,"text":"at collecting her data."},"99":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, she had no idea what to look for."},"101":{"dur":3,"text":"This really was a needle in a haystack sort of search,"},"104":{"dur":2,"text":"so she asked everything she could think of."},"107":{"dur":1,"text":"Had the children eaten boiled sweets?"},"109":{"dur":2,"text":"Had they consumed colored drinks?"},"111":{"dur":1,"text":"Did they eat fish and chips?"},"112":{"dur":2,"text":"Did they have indoor or outdoor plumbing?"},"114":{"dur":3,"text":"What time of life had they started school?"},"118":{"dur":3,"text":"And when her carbon copied questionnaire started to come back,"},"121":{"dur":2,"text":"one thing and one thing only jumped out"},"124":{"dur":2,"text":"with the statistical clarity of a kind that"},"127":{"dur":2,"text":"most scientists can only dream of."},"129":{"dur":1,"text":"By a rate of two to one,"},"131":{"dur":2,"text":"the children who had died"},"133":{"dur":6,"text":"had had mothers who had been X-rayed when pregnant."},"140":{"dur":4,"text":"Now that finding flew in the face of conventional wisdom."},"144":{"dur":1,"text":"Conventional wisdom held"},"146":{"dur":3,"text":"that everything was safe up to a point, a threshold."},"150":{"dur":2,"text":"It flew in the face of conventional wisdom,"},"152":{"dur":3,"text":"which was huge enthusiasm for the cool new technology"},"156":{"dur":3,"text":"of that age, which was the X-ray machine."},"160":{"dur":4,"text":"And it flew in the face of doctors' idea of themselves,"},"164":{"dur":3,"text":"which was as people who helped patients,"},"168":{"dur":2,"text":"they didn't harm them."},"170":{"dur":3,"text":"Nevertheless, Alice Stewart rushed to publish"},"174":{"dur":3,"text":"her preliminary findings in The Lancet in 1956."},"178":{"dur":4,"text":"People got very excited, there was talk of the Nobel Prize,"},"182":{"dur":2,"text":"and Alice really was in a big hurry"},"184":{"dur":3,"text":"to try to study all the cases of childhood cancer she could find"},"188":{"dur":2,"text":"before they disappeared."},"190":{"dur":4,"text":"In fact, she need not have hurried."},"194":{"dur":4,"text":"It was fully 25 years before the British and medical --"},"198":{"dur":2,"text":"British and American medical establishments"},"201":{"dur":6,"text":"abandoned the practice of X-raying pregnant women."},"207":{"dur":5,"text":"The data was out there, it was open, it was freely available,"},"213":{"dur":4,"text":"but nobody wanted to know."},"217":{"dur":2,"text":"A child a week was dying,"},"220":{"dur":2,"text":"but nothing changed."},"222":{"dur":6,"text":"Openness alone can't drive change."},"229":{"dur":5,"text":"So for 25 years Alice Stewart had a very big fight on her hands."},"234":{"dur":3,"text":"So, how did she know that she was right?"},"237":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, she had a fantastic model for thinking."},"241":{"dur":2,"text":"She worked with a statistician named George Kneale,"},"243":{"dur":2,"text":"and George was pretty much everything that Alice wasn't."},"246":{"dur":3,"text":"So, Alice was very outgoing and sociable,"},"249":{"dur":2,"text":"and George was a recluse."},"251":{"dur":4,"text":"Alice was very warm, very empathetic with her patients."},"255":{"dur":4,"text":"George frankly preferred numbers to people."},"259":{"dur":3,"text":"But he said this fantastic thing about their working relationship."},"263":{"dur":6,"text":"He said, \"My job is to prove Dr. Stewart wrong.\""},"270":{"dur":3,"text":"He actively sought disconfirmation."},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"Different ways of looking at her models,"},"275":{"dur":3,"text":"at her statistics, different ways of crunching the data"},"279":{"dur":3,"text":"in order to disprove her."},"282":{"dur":5,"text":"He saw his job as creating conflict around her theories."},"287":{"dur":3,"text":"Because it was only by not being able to prove"},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"that she was wrong,"},"293":{"dur":3,"text":"that George could give Alice the confidence she needed"},"296":{"dur":2,"text":"to know that she was right."},"299":{"dur":4,"text":"It's a fantastic model of collaboration --"},"304":{"dur":5,"text":"thinking partners who aren't echo chambers."},"309":{"dur":2,"text":"I wonder how many of us have,"},"311":{"dur":6,"text":"or dare to have, such collaborators."},"318":{"dur":3,"text":"Alice and George were very good at conflict."},"322":{"dur":3,"text":"They saw it as thinking."},"325":{"dur":4,"text":"So what does that kind of constructive conflict require?"},"329":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, first of all, it requires that we find people"},"333":{"dur":2,"text":"who are very different from ourselves."},"335":{"dur":4,"text":"That means we have to resist the neurobiological drive,"},"340":{"dur":4,"text":"which means that we really prefer people mostly like ourselves,"},"344":{"dur":2,"text":"and it means we have to seek out people"},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"with different backgrounds, different disciplines,"},"349":{"dur":4,"text":"different ways of thinking and different experience,"},"353":{"dur":3,"text":"and find ways to engage with them."},"357":{"dur":4,"text":"That requires a lot of patience and a lot of energy."},"361":{"dur":1,"text":"And the more I've thought about this,"},"363":{"dur":5,"text":"the more I think, really, that that's a kind of love."},"368":{"dur":3,"text":"Because you simply won't commit that kind of energy"},"371":{"dur":4,"text":"and time if you don't really care."},"376":{"dur":4,"text":"And it also means that we have to be prepared to change our minds."},"381":{"dur":2,"text":"Alice's daughter told me"},"383":{"dur":3,"text":"that every time Alice went head-to-head with a fellow scientist,"},"386":{"dur":4,"text":"they made her think and think and think again."},"390":{"dur":4,"text":"\"My mother,\" she said, \"My mother didn't enjoy a fight,"},"394":{"dur":5,"text":"but she was really good at them.\""},"399":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's one thing to do that in a one-to-one relationship."},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"But it strikes me that the biggest problems we face,"},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"many of the biggest disasters that we've experienced,"},"410":{"dur":1,"text":"mostly haven't come from individuals,"},"412":{"dur":1,"text":"they've come from organizations,"},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"some of them bigger than countries,"},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"many of them capable of affecting hundreds,"},"418":{"dur":4,"text":"thousands, even millions of lives."},"422":{"dur":4,"text":"So how do organizations think?"},"426":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, for the most part, they don't."},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"And that isn't because they don't want to,"},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"it's really because they can't."},"436":{"dur":3,"text":"And they can't because the people inside of them"},"439":{"dur":4,"text":"are too afraid of conflict."},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"In surveys of European and American executives,"},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"fully 85 percent of them acknowledged"},"449":{"dur":3,"text":"that they had issues or concerns at work"},"453":{"dur":3,"text":"that they were afraid to raise."},"456":{"dur":3,"text":"Afraid of the conflict that that would provoke,"},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"afraid to get embroiled in arguments"},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"that they did not know how to manage,"},"464":{"dur":4,"text":"and felt that they were bound to lose."},"468":{"dur":6,"text":"Eighty-five percent is a really big number."},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"It means that organizations mostly can't do"},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"what George and Alice so triumphantly did."},"480":{"dur":4,"text":"They can't think together."},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"And it means that people like many of us,"},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"who have run organizations,"},"489":{"dur":3,"text":"and gone out of our way to try to find the very best people we can,"},"492":{"dur":6,"text":"mostly fail to get the best out of them."},"498":{"dur":3,"text":"So how do we develop the skills that we need?"},"502":{"dur":4,"text":"Because it does take skill and practice, too."},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"If we aren't going to be afraid of conflict,"},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"we have to see it as thinking,"},"511":{"dur":4,"text":"and then we have to get really good at it."},"516":{"dur":4,"text":"So, recently, I worked with an executive named Joe,"},"520":{"dur":3,"text":"and Joe worked for a medical device company."},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"And Joe was very worried about the device that he was working on."},"526":{"dur":3,"text":"He thought that it was too complicated"},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"and he thought that its complexity"},"531":{"dur":4,"text":"created margins of error that could really hurt people."},"536":{"dur":4,"text":"He was afraid of doing damage to the patients he was trying to help."},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"But when he looked around his organization,"},"542":{"dur":4,"text":"nobody else seemed to be at all worried."},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"So, he didn't really want to say anything."},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"After all, maybe they knew something he didn't."},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe he'd look stupid."},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"But he kept worrying about it,"},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"and he worried about it so much that he got to the point"},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"where he thought the only thing he could do"},"561":{"dur":4,"text":"was leave a job he loved."},"565":{"dur":4,"text":"In the end, Joe and I found a way"},"569":{"dur":1,"text":"for him to raise his concerns."},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"And what happened then is what almost always"},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"happens in this situation."},"576":{"dur":3,"text":"It turned out everybody had exactly the same"},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"questions and doubts."},"581":{"dur":4,"text":"So now Joe had allies. They could think together."},"585":{"dur":3,"text":"And yes, there was a lot of conflict and debate"},"588":{"dur":4,"text":"and argument, but that allowed everyone around the table"},"592":{"dur":4,"text":"to be creative, to solve the problem,"},"596":{"dur":4,"text":"and to change the device."},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"Joe was what a lot of people might think of"},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"as a whistle-blower,"},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"except that like almost all whistle-blowers,"},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"he wasn't a crank at all,"},"611":{"dur":3,"text":"he was passionately devoted to the organization"},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"and the higher purposes that that organization served."},"618":{"dur":3,"text":"But he had been so afraid of conflict,"},"622":{"dur":5,"text":"until finally he became more afraid of the silence."},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"And when he dared to speak,"},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"he discovered much more inside himself"},"632":{"dur":5,"text":"and much more give in the system than he had ever imagined."},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"And his colleagues don't think of him as a crank."},"641":{"dur":5,"text":"They think of him as a leader."},"646":{"dur":4,"text":"So, how do we have these conversations more easily"},"650":{"dur":1,"text":"and more often?"},"652":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, the University of Delft"},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"requires that its PhD students"},"657":{"dur":3,"text":"have to submit five statements that they're prepared to defend."},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"It doesn't really matter what the statements are about,"},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"what matters is that the candidates are willing and able"},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"to stand up to authority."},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"I think it's a fantastic system,"},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"but I think leaving it to PhD candidates"},"675":{"dur":4,"text":"is far too few people, and way too late in life."},"680":{"dur":3,"text":"I think we need to be teaching these skills"},"683":{"dur":4,"text":"to kids and adults at every stage of their development,"},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"if we want to have thinking organizations"},"689":{"dur":3,"text":"and a thinking society."},"693":{"dur":5,"text":"The fact is that most of the biggest catastrophes that we've witnessed"},"699":{"dur":6,"text":"rarely come from information that is secret or hidden."},"705":{"dur":4,"text":"It comes from information that is freely available and out there,"},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"but that we are willfully blind to,"},"712":{"dur":3,"text":"because we can't handle, don't want to handle,"},"715":{"dur":4,"text":"the conflict that it provokes."},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"But when we dare to break that silence,"},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"or when we dare to see,"},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"and we create conflict,"},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"we enable ourselves and the people around us"},"730":{"dur":4,"text":"to do our very best thinking."},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"Open information is fantastic,"},"737":{"dur":3,"text":"open networks are essential."},"740":{"dur":1,"text":"But the truth won't set us free"},"742":{"dur":3,"text":"until we develop the skills and the habit and the talent"},"746":{"dur":4,"text":"and the moral courage to use it."},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"Openness isn't the end."},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"It's the beginning."},"757":{"dur":11,"text":"(Applause)"}}
