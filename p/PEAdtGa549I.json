problem."},"448":{"dur":4,"text":">> [LAUGH]\n>> And this, as I see it, is the problem."},"455":{"dur":4,"text":"This is, the fact that Nowadays\nwe are obsessed with what we eat,"},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"more than anything."},"461":{"dur":4,"text":"More and\nmore diets are coming out every week and"},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"despite this obsession with food and"},"469":{"dur":6,"text":"our diets in the last 30 years,\nrates of obesity have tripled."},"475":{"dur":5,"text":"And the same time doctors like myself\nhave been my patients it's simple."},"480":{"dur":4,"text":"You just eat less, exercise more,\ncalories in equals calories out,"},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"you will lose weight."},"487":{"dur":6,"text":"And this is found in every single country\nthat this line has been totted out."},"494":{"dur":4,"text":"So clearly, this is one of the major\nmyths that we're all facing and"},"499":{"dur":4,"text":"we are being mislead about the fact\nthat there is one diet that fits all."},"503":{"dur":6,"text":"WE are mislead about the fact that it\nis simple calorie counting would work."},"510":{"dur":3,"text":"We are misled by the fact that\nexercise makes you lose weight."},"513":{"dur":5,"text":"And endless other myths."},"518":{"dur":7,"text":"So let's find out a bit more why this is\nwrong and what else might be behind it."},"526":{"dur":5,"text":"We're told that these diets are crucial to\nus and there is a new best selling diet"},"531":{"dur":3,"text":"all the time,\nexcluding something from our diet and"},"535":{"dur":3,"text":"this is the secret, just exclude that and\neverything else will go our way."},"538":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's take away grains,\ngluten is deadly."},"541":{"dur":5,"text":"Let's just take away fats, and\nlet's take away carbohydrates."},"547":{"dur":4,"text":"Let's take away anything\nthat's unrefined

those."},"574":{"dur":4,"text":"And, this is the nub of the problem here,\nwe're stuck with these extremely"},"579":{"dur":5,"text":"restrictive diets and this is affecting\nus in ways we've never thought possible."},"586":{"dur":6,"text":"Now, another big myth that actually\nstarted predominantly in this country and"},"592":{"dur":5,"text":"spread across the world like a disease,\nwas the fact that fat is bad for you."},"599":{"dur":1,"text":"High fat diets bad for you."},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"They give you heart disease."},"603":{"dur":4,"text":"Fat equals fat,\nthat was a very simple message."},"608":{"dur":1,"text":"And everyone followed it."},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"Every doctor followed it,\nthey still do today."},"613":{"dur":3,"text":"And this study came out two years ago."},"617":{"dur":5,"text":"And it follows epidemiological evidence"},"622":{"dur":4,"text":"that the people that eat the most\nfat in Europe, live the longest."},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"These are the people in\nthe southern Mediterranean."},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"They eat two or three times as\nmuch fat as the average American."},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"And, they are the centenarians."},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"They're the ones laughing\nin their retirement,"},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"at age 100 in a nice, in the sun."},"639":{"dur":2,"text":">> [LAUGH]\n>> All that fat they're eating."},"643":{"dur":4,"text":"And, this study was the first randomized\ntrial that lasted five years, and"},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"has been the best study\never done on nutrition."},"650":{"dur":4,"text":"Seven-and-a-half thousand Spanish\npeople were randomized to two groups,"},"657":{"dur":6,"text":"and these were 60 year old Spaniards, who\nare a bit on the fat side, but no disease."},"663":{"dur":3,"text":"So, pretty average, and"},"666":{"dur":4,"text":"half of them were given the low fat diet\nas prescribed by every American physician."},"673":{"dur":5,"text":"And the other half were randomized\nto a high-fat Mediterranean diet,"},"678":{"dur":4,"text":"supplemented with extra olive oil,\nin case they didn't have enough, and"},"682":{"dur":4,"text":"extra nuts in case they didn't\nhave enough fat and calories."},"687":{"dur":3,"text":"And what happened,\nthe study was actually stopped early,"},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"because of an excess of deaths."},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"And that happened to be\nin the low fat group."},"701":{"dur":4,"text":"So, they had a third less heart disease,\nstroke, diabetes."},"706":{"dur":5,"text":"And even a third less, breast cancer."},"711":{"dur":6,"text":"And this is the final nail in the coffin,\nI think, for the low-fat hypothesis."},"717":{"dur":4,"text":"But this is one of these extra myths that\nwould be misled for so long that what"},"721":{"dur":6,"text":"we're eating is not just a simple\nidea of fat, protein, carbohydrates."},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"This reductionist idea,\nthere's much more to it."},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"It's more complex, and\nthere's an elephant in the room here and"},"733":{"dur":1,"text":"there's also an elephant on the slide."},"734":{"dur":4,"text":">> [LAUGH]\n>> And that is, we've been"},"739":{"dur":4,"text":"missing the most important organ in\nour bodies, that is our microbiome."},"745":{"dur":3,"text":"All of us have a hundred\nthousand microbes in us"},"749":{"dur":4,"text":"that are ten times more than\nwe have cells in our body, so"},"754":{"dur":3,"text":"we are 90 percent microbe and\nonly ten percent human."},"759":{"dur":4,"text":"And we're only about one percent\ngenetically human because we actually"},"763":{"dur":1,"text":"have 100 times more genes."},"765":{"dur":4,"text":"All of them pumping out chemicals and\nvitamins and"},"770":{"dur":4,"text":"hormones that we all need and keep us\nalive and until recently we thought they"},"775":{"dur":5,"text":"were just nasty things that we just had to\nget rid of with sprays and antibiotics."},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"They were deadly, because we\ncould just culture a few of them."},"783":{"dur":5,"text":"It turns out that with genetic technology\nwe can now measure hundreds and"},"788":{"dur":3,"text":"thousands of the different\nspecies very precisely and"},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"we know that 99% of them are good for us."},"795":{"dur":3,"text":"They're our friends and we've been\ntrying to kill them for decades."},"800":{"dur":4,"text":"And it also turns out this new technology\nthat when you study people and"},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"we've studied thousands of\npeople now in the population."},"808":{"dur":1,"text":"Everybody is quite unique."},"811":{"dur":6,"text":"We share only a small percentage of our\nmicrobes with the rest of the population."},"818":{"dur":3,"text":"Even the person sitting next to you,\neven in our families."},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"We have a unique finger print\nthat goes of us all our lives."},"825":{"dur":6,"text":"And this also explaining why perhaps one\ndiet, one idea doesn't fit everybody."},"831":{"dur":1,"text":"Because we're much more\ndifferent than we thought."},"835":{"dur":4,"text":"Now I've been studying twins as\nyou've heard for over 21 years."},"840":{"dur":1,"text":"And we have thousands of them."},"841":{"dur":2,"text":"And we've started looking\nat their microbes as well."},"845":{"dur":2,"text":"As you know,\nwhen identical twins are born,"},"848":{"dur":2,"text":"they are genetic clones, exactly the same."},"851":{"dur":6,"text":"But like any other babies when they're\nborn, they're born predominantly sterile,"},"857":{"dur":5,"text":"no microbes at all, and at birth,\nthose microbes get into the system and"},"863":{"dur":4,"text":"develop this community\nthat lasts all our lives."},"867":{"dur":5,"text":"And those first few days,\nmonths are really crucial to forming"},"872":{"dur":2,"text":"these microbes that play such\nan important role in our lives."},"876":{"dur":4,"text":"And it turns out that there\nare the major factors that alter this,"},"880":{"dur":5,"text":"that if natural birth\nwhich by evolution for"},"886":{"dur":5,"text":"millions of years has meant that\nthe babies face goes through the birth"},"891":{"dur":5,"text":"canal and get's exposed to all the mucky\nbits that come out is deliberate."},"897":{"dur":2,"text":"And it all gets in through the mouth and"},"899":{"dur":4,"text":"those microbes act as fertilizers for\nall the other things that happen,"},"904":{"dur":2,"text":"and allow the baby to then\ndigest breast milk, etcetera."},"908":{"dur":2,"text":"And also build the immune system."},"910":{"dur":4,"text":"Without it, babies would die very quickly\nand have no decent immune system or brain."},"916":{"dur":3,"text":"Now we now know that in the modern world,"},"919":{"dur":3,"text":"where everything is safety first,\nCaesarean sections rule."},"923":{"dur":1,"text":"And in the U.S."},"925":{"dur":5,"text":"over a third of babies are now brought\ninto life by Caesarean section."},"930":{"dur":5,"text":"And in places like New York and\ncertain bits of Boston, it's over 65%."},"935":{"dur":5,"text":"And this totally changes the microbes,\nand when we looked at twins."},"941":{"dur":4,"text":"The fact that they can differ\ndepends on who picked them up first"},"945":{"dur":0,"text":"in the delivery room."},"948":{"dur":3,"text":"I was delivered by Caesarean section, so"},"951":{"dur":5,"text":"I am desperately trying to find out\nwho that nurse was so I can blame her."},"957":{"dur":5,"text":"So these things are very important and\ntwins generally have similar microbes."},"962":{"dur":3,"text":"As they grow up, as all other things but\nthen they can separate and"},"966":{"dur":1,"text":"be quite different and so"},"967":{"dur":5,"text":"although we found on average there was\na genetic component to having no microbes."},"973":{"dur":5,"text":"There were individuals, twin pairs look\nquite different like this pair here who"},"978":{"dur":6,"text":"differed by about 30 pounds in weight and\nhad very different microbial compositions."},"984":{"dur":3,"text":"So it looks like, the microbes\ninside them are playing a role,"},"988":{"dur":1,"text":"in some of these metabolic differences."},"991":{"dur":4,"text":"And, we went on to look at over a thousand\nof these, looking at the role but"},"996":{"dur":2,"text":"putting which microbes might\nbe important in obesity."},"998":{"dur":4,"text":"And we did this with our\ncolleagues at Cornell University"},"1003":{"dur":4,"text":"who did all the genotyping and\nthe hard work."},"1007":{"dur":4,"text":"And what it showed was yes, there were\ncertain microbes that if you had them,"},"1012":{"dur":4,"text":"either made you more likely to get fat or\nless likely."},"1016":{"dur":5,"text":"And the one that the tabloid\nnewspapers in the UK called the fat"},"1021":{"dur":5,"text":"busting microbe is this one which most\npeople can't spell, christensenella."},"1026":{"dur":1,"text":"I can't even say

inside us."},"1074":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, what I've said for obesity"},"1078":{"dur":4,"text":"needs to be thought in a way of\nmany other disease, as a garden."},"1083":{"dur":2,"text":"Basically if

is a project that rally drew\nme into the field of Microbiome."},"2513":{"dur":5,"text":"So, Athos over at children's hospital came\nto me and said, Eric, we've got a problem."},"2518":{"dur":5,"text":"At this time, Athos ran the Pediatric\nInflammatory Bowel Disease Clinic"},"2524":{"dur":2,"text":"over at Children's Hospital."},"2526":{"dur":5,"text":"And he said we've got a problem because\non average there's a three year lag time"},"2532":{"dur":5,"text":"before the onset of disease, onset of\nIBD in children, and after a diagnosis."},"2537":{"dur":4,"text":"And what that means is that there's three\nyears go by before symptoms show up,"},"2542":{"dur":2,"text":"and patients get\nthe treatment they need and"},"2545":{"dur":2,"text":"often times that can\nlead to poor outcomes."},"2547":{"dur":3,"text":"So, often times, the first intervention\nhas to be surgical, okay, and"},"2551":{"dur":3,"text":"these kids have to have part\nof their colon removed."},"2554":{"dur":2,"text":"Whereas, if we had gotten them earlier,\nand"},"2556":{"dur":2,"text":"managed the disease,\nmaybe we could establish a better outcome."},"2560":{"dur":4,"text":"So he said, maybe there's some\nway that we could sequence"},"2565":{"dur":4,"text":"get us noninvasive stool sample, sequence\nit and determine if the patient had"},"2570":{"dur":5,"text":"inflammatory valve disease or\nmaybe just IBS, something like that."},"2577":{"dur":4,"text":"So the other option of course,\nthe gold standard, is colonoscopy."},"2582":{"dur":3,"text":"But, the downside here is, is every eight\nyear old child that comes into the clinic,"},"2586":{"dur":2,"text":"you don't wanna send them out for\na colonoscopy, right?"},"2588":{"dur":2,"text":">> [LAUGH]\n>> Colonoscopy is not very pleasant."},"2591":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, so\nthere's this fundamental tradeoff, and"},"2593":{"dur":2,"text":"Athos said, maybe we can do\nbetter with microbiome science."},"2596":{"dur":3,"text":"So what Athos did is he went out,\nand he took a good sample of,"},"2599":{"dur":3,"text":"folks that came to his clinic,\nthat he later diagnosed as"},"2603":{"dur":4,"text":"not having inflammatory bowel disease, so\nhe did a colonoscopy, he ruled IBD out."},"2608":{"dur":5,"text":"And then he recruited some patients that\nhad inflammatory disease and two different"},"2613":{"dur":4,"text":"versions, Crohn's disease and ulcerative\ncolitis, the two

every column in this\ngraph is a patient,"},"2624":{"dur":4,"text":"it's a sick kid and\nthese are the control kids."},"2629":{"dur":1,"text":"They're still sick."},"2631":{"dur":2,"text":"They're

clinic."},"2641":{"dur":4,"text":"But after it was later determined\nthat they did not have IBD."},"2645":{"dur":3,"text":"These are the children\nthat had Crohn's Disease,"},"2648":{"dur":4,"text":"and these are the children\nthat had ulcerative colitis."},"2652":{"dur":1,"text":"And on the rows, here,"},"2654":{"dur":4,"text":"what you see are all the different\nbacteria that we sequenced in their guts."},"2658":{"dur":1,"text":"So I want you to look at this and"},"2660":{"dur":4,"text":"tell me if you see any bacterium that\nis really indicative of disease."},"2665":{"dur":2,"text":"If they have this bacterium they're sick."},"2667":{"dur":1,"text":"That's the germ,\nthat's the one we need to get rid of."},"2669":{"dur":7,"text":">>

without IBD is E.coli."},"2699":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay, so all of the kids that had a lot\nof E.coli had inflammatory disease."},"2704":{"dur":4,"text":"But, if you're gonna use lots of\nE.coli as your biomarker for disease,"},"2708":{"dur":4,"text":"you'd only detect disease in about ten or\n15% of the kids."},"2713":{"dur":1,"text":"So on its own it's not good enough."},"2715":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's not a key hallmark\nchange in microbiome"},"2719":{"dur":3,"text":"that tells you whether a child\nhas inflammatory disease or not."},"2722":{"dur":4,"text":"But what we were able to do is we were\nable to take all these weak signals."},"2727":{"dur":5,"text":"All of these things that look like\nmaybe if they have a little bit"},"2732":{"dur":5,"text":"less clostridia than you would

calprotectin."},"2751":{"dur":4,"text":"So I would argue that this future's not\nvery far off, and one of the things"},"2756":{"dur":4,"text":"that we found in the study was that\nwhen we re-analyze

tell you a little story about\na self experimentation study that"},"2828":{"dur":1,"text":"I think Tim alluded to."},"2830":{"dur":3,"text":"So my student,\nLawrence Davin and I in

travel."},"2851":{"dur":6,"text":"Basically, everything we could think of,\nrecorded it for about a full year."},"2857":{"dur":3,"text":"Laurence said if I write an iPhone\napp to track that information,"},"2861":{"dur":1,"text":"can I charge an iPhone to the branch?"},"2862":{"dur":1,"text":"I said sure."},"2864":{"dur":2,"text":"So now there's an app for\nthat for anyone that's interested."},"2869":{"dur":0,"text":"And so this is what we found."},"2870":{"dur":4,"text":"In 2009 this is my microbiome in 2009."},"2874":{"dur":2,"text":"This is Lawrence's microbiome in 2009 and"},"2877":{"dur":3,"text":"the thing I want you guys to\nnotice is they're very distinct."},"2880":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, so\nthere's a lot of variation day to day."},"2882":{"dur":3,"text":"But I could pick any day from my time\nseries and show it to you and you wouldn't"},"2886":{"dur":3,"text":"need any fancy computer algorithms\nto figure out if it was my sample or"},"2889":{"dur":1,"text":"Lawrence's sample."},"2891":{"dur":3,"text":"So our microbiomes are very,\nvery distinct."},"2894":{"dur":1,"text":"They are very distinct ecosystems."},"2895":{"dur":3,"text":"And they change day to day but\nthey maintain their, sort of,"},"2898":{"dur":2,"text":"unique quality that's\ndifferent from each other."},"2901":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, so,\nwhat are the things that affected it?"},"2904":{"dur":2,"text":"Certainly, diet played a big role."},"2907":{"dur":4,"text":"But, one particular life\nevent really affected mine."},"2911":{"dur":5,"text":"So about three quarters of the way\ninto the study, actually I would say,"},"2917":{"dur":5,"text":"almost six years ago to the day,"},"2922":{"dur":4,"text":"[LAUGH] I took a colleague up\non an offer to go out to brunch."},"2926":{"dur":4,"text":"I made the mistake of ordering the chef's\nspecial french toast and 48 hours later,"},"2931":{"dur":4,"text":"I was deep in the throws of\na horrible salmonella infection and"},"2935":{"dur":2,"text":"you can see the salmonella down here."},"2938":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is my microbiome again."},"2940":{"dur":4,"text":"And here I've blown it up so every\nsingle row is a different bacterium, and"},"2945":{"dur":3,"text":"the red colors mean there's more of that\nbacteria on that day than other days, and"},"2948":{"dur":2,"text":"the blue colors mean there's\nless than on other days."},"2951":{"dur":4,"text":"And you can see, as soon as the salmonella\nappeared all of these bacteria"},"2956":{"dur":3,"text":"basically disappeared in\nabout a week after infection."},"2960":{"dur":4,"text":"Some of those bacteria came back, but\nthe majority went permanently extinct and"},"2964":{"dur":2,"text":"were sort of extinguished\nfrom my microbiome, but"},"2967":{"dur":2,"text":"they were replaced with all\nof these bacteria in here."},"2970":{"dur":4,"text":"And so we saw complete\nrestructuring of the microbiome as"},"2974":{"dur":2,"text":"the result of this life event."},"2977":{"dur":4,"text":"And what I think is fascinating is, even\nafter that total

still looks like me,\nit doesn't look like Lawrence."},"2990":{"dur":4,"text":"So my microbiome was able to\ncompletely reboot itself but"},"2994":{"dur":4,"text":"reboot sort of a different\noperating system than Lawrence had."},"2998":{"dur":0,"text":"And that's still, I think,"},"2999":{"dur":5,"text":"one of the mysteries from that study\nthat we still don't fully understand."},"3004":{"dur":2,"text":"So we know we can start\nto monitor these things."},"3006":{"dur":4,"text":"The technology's getting cheap enough\nthat we can really roll it out and"},"3010":{"dur":4,"text":"we're thinking of doing that next year for\ninflammatory bowel disease patients."},"3015":{"dur":2,"text":"Microbiome is only the beginning\nof the things we want to measure."},"3018":{"dur":1,"text":"So we want to use wearable devices and"},"3020":{"dur":4,"text":"a lot of technologies that are making all\nof this whole process quite a bit easier."},"3024":{"dur":1,"text":"We want to look at the immune system and"},"3026":{"dur":3,"text":"see how the body is responding to those\nmicrobes, not just look at the microbes."},"3029":{"dur":2,"text":"And so\nthat's what we see as kind of the future."},"3032":{"dur":5,"text":"I wanna talk about one more thing,\nso we talked about diagnosis but"},"3037":{"dur":2,"text":"I didn\u2019t tell you,\nI said wanna make drugs from bugs."},"3040":{"dur":1,"text":"How do we do that?"},"3041":{"dur":1,"text":"And the best model for"},"3043":{"dur":4,"text":"doing that we have right now is looking\nat Clostridium difficile infection."},"3047":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we wanna move from diagnosing\nto engineering the microbiome, but"},"3051":{"dur":3,"text":"let me tell you a little bit about\nthe course of the disease first."},"3054":{"dur":2,"text":"So what we have, we generally\nhave a person with a healthy gut."},"3057":{"dur":3,"text":"So all these germs and\nstuff, that's good, okay?"},"3060":{"dur":2,"text":"You guys should know that by\nthis point in the presentation."},"3064":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is a healthy microbiome."},"3066":{"dur":1,"text":"We hit it with antibiotics."},"3067":{"dur":4,"text":"And we sort of clear cut that beautiful\nforest or that beautiful English garden."},"3072":{"dur":4,"text":"And so now we have all this empty\nniche space that invasive species"},"3076":{"dur":1,"text":"can come in and get a foothold in."},"3078":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, so, if we deliver antibiotics, and"},"3081":{"dur":5,"text":"the patient is exposed to C difficile,\nthat C diff can basically take over."},"3086":{"dur":1,"text":"And, once C diff takes over,\nwhat do we do?"},"3089":{"dur":2,"text":"We give the patient antibiotics again,\nof course,"},"3091":{"dur":1,"text":"cuz now they have a terrible infection."},"3093":{"dur":5,"text":"In many cases, the antibiotics\nwill return us to this state."},"3098":{"dur":4,"text":"In which case, the patient will\nbecome reinfected with C difficile."},"3103":{"dur":4,"text":"Then it becomes even more likely that the\nnext time we treat him, and what do we do,"},"3107":{"dur":2,"text":"of course, we give him antibiotics again."},"3110":{"dur":3,"text":"It becomes more likely that\nthey're gonna recur with C diff."},"3114":{"dur":4,"text":"And after three or four or five cycles\nof antibiotics, it starts to become very"},"3119":{"dur":4,"text":"unlikely that the patient is ever going to\nrespond to another course of antibiotics."},"3123":{"dur":5,"text":"So they're sort of locked, sort of\nalternating between living on vancomycin,"},"3128":{"dur":3,"text":"which is not fun, and\nhaving C diff, which is less fun."},"3132":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay, and so two very terrible choices."},"3136":{"dur":4,"text":"But it turns out that there's a cure,\nand the cure is to treat"},"3141":{"dur":3,"text":"the patient with antibiotics and\nthen instead of waiting for"},"3145":{"dur":5,"text":"the patient to be exposed to C diff and\nrecur, we give him a fecal transplant."},"3150":{"dur":4,"text":"So we take bacteria from a healthy\ndonor and we infuse that into their"},"3155":{"dur":4,"text":"gut ecosystem, let those healthy bugs take\nover, and they sort of crowd out the,"},"3160":{"dur":4,"text":"we replace the clear cut forest with\nthe beautiful lush English garden and"},"3164":{"dur":1,"text":"then C diff can't get a foothold."},"3165":{"dur":3,"text":"And it is effective in\n85 to 90% of the cases."},"3171":{"dur":2,"text":"So we got involved in\na study at Mass General."},"3174":{"dur":3,"text":"This is a study where there were four\nhealthy donors that treated about 20"},"3178":{"dur":4,"text":"patients and\nabout 18 of those patients were recovered."},"3182":{"dur":3,"text":"Especially one of those donors\ntreated 12 patients, okay?"},"3185":{"dur":4,"text":"And this was a study that was\ncarried out by Libby Hohmann,"},"3190":{"dur":3,"text":"Ilan Youngster,\nJenny Sauk over at Mass General, and"},"3194":{"dur":2,"text":"Dirk Gevers and\nBruce Birren at the Broad Institute."},"3197":{"dur":4,"text":"And we used that, so we went in and\nwe looked at the clinical study and"},"3201":{"dur":1,"text":"we say, we wanna get some genomics."},"3203":{"dur":2,"text":"We wanna see what's really\ngoing on with those microbes."},"3205":{"dur":4,"text":"And so we did that, and so a really great\ngraduate student in my lab, Chris Smiley,"},"3210":{"dur":5,"text":"he's a computer scientist, he made this\ngraphic of what a patient looks like,"},"3215":{"dur":4,"text":"what their microbes look like,\njust coming off of vancomycin."},"3219":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is a patient with\nClostridium difficile, okay?"},"3222":{"dur":3,"text":"And so each one of these blue bands is\na different bacteria in our patient,"},"3226":{"dur":1,"text":"in our sick patient."},"3229":{"dur":4,"text":"Down here you see these are all different\nbacteria that where in the healthy person"},"3233":{"dur":4,"text":"that gave bacteria to the patient and\nyou can see they're very different."},"3237":{"dur":3,"text":"And now I want you to try to squint and\nsee if I combine,"},"3241":{"dur":4,"text":"if I add these bacteria to this patient,\nwhat's gonna happen."},"3245":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is what happens."},"3247":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is our patient after the patient\ngets a fecal transplant from this donor."},"3251":{"dur":1,"text":"And we squinted at that for"},"3253":{"dur":4,"text":"a long time, it doesn't look like just\nadding the two profiles together."},"3257":{"dur":1,"text":"It doesn't look like an AND gate or"},"3259":{"dur":4,"text":"an OR gate or any of the different\nthings that we could think of."},"3263":{"dur":2,"text":"The human eye is pretty good\nat pattern recognition, but"},"3266":{"dur":1,"text":"we didn't see any patterns here."},"3267":{"dur":1,"text":"But Chris went back."},"3268":{"dur":5,"text":"He built a machine learning algorithm\nto try to solve the problem of given"},"3273":{"dur":4,"text":"the patient and the donor, what are they\ngonna look like post fecal transplant?"},"3278":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is what he found."},"3280":{"dur":4,"text":"So he found, his algorithm was about\n86% accurate in actually predicting"},"3285":{"dur":3,"text":"what the patient would look like\nafter the fecal transplant."},"3288":{"dur":4,"text":"And the thing that's very exciting\nto us is that now it says,"},"3292":{"dur":2,"text":"if we know what the patient\nis supposed to look like, and"},"3295":{"dur":4,"text":"we know what they look like now,\nand we have a lot of different"},"3300":{"dur":4,"text":"possible donors to combine them with,\nthen we can sequence our patient."},"3304":{"dur":2,"text":"We can sequence all\nthe different donors and"},"3307":{"dur":4,"text":"we can ask our computer algorithm,\nwhich of the possible donors that"},"3312":{"dur":3,"text":"we could use to give a fecal\ntransplant to this patient will"},"3315":{"dur":4,"text":"transform this patient into what we think\nthe ideal healthy gut would look like."},"3320":{"dur":4,"text":"So the only other step that we\nneed to do that is we need a bank"},"3324":{"dur":4,"text":"of hundreds of different healthy donors\nthat we can just call up and say,"},"3329":{"dur":2,"text":"yeah, give us donor number 51."},"3331":{"dur":5,"text":">>

off."},"4756":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think we can, in a way,"},"4759":{"dur":4,"text":"safeguard ourselves against some of these\nproblems by increasing a variety of
