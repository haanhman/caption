{"0":{"dur":7,"text":"Translator: Camille Mart\u00ednez\nReviewer: Krystian Aparta"},"12":{"dur":3,"text":"Back in 2003,"},"15":{"dur":2,"text":"the UK government carried out a survey.a"},"19":{"dur":3,"text":"And it was a survey that measured\nlevels of numeracy"},"22":{"dur":1,"text":"in the population."},"23":{"dur":1,"text":"And they were shocked to find out"},"25":{"dur":3,"text":"that for every 100 working age\nadults in the country,"},"28":{"dur":3,"text":"47 of them lacked Level 1 numeracy skills."},"32":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, Level 1 numeracy skills --\nthat's low-end GCSE score."},"37":{"dur":3,"text":"It's the ability to deal with fractions,\npercentages and decimals."},"40":{"dur":4,"text":"So this figure prompted\na lot of hand-wringing in Whitehall."},"45":{"dur":1,"text":"Policies were changed,"},"46":{"dur":1,"text":"investments were made,"},"48":{"dur":3,"text":"and then they ran\nthe survey again in 2011."},"51":{"dur":2,"text":"So can you guess\nwhat happened to this number?"},"55":{"dur":1,"text":"It went up to 49."},"57":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"58":{"dur":2,"text":"And in fact, when I reported\nthis figure in the FT,"},"61":{"dur":1,"text":"one of our readers joked and said,"},"62":{"dur":3,"text":"\"This figure is only shocking\nto 51 percent of the population.\""},"66":{"dur":2,"text":"(Laughter)"},"69":{"dur":3,"text":"But I preferred, actually,\nthe reaction of a schoolchild"},"72":{"dur":3,"text":"when I presented\nat a school this information,"},"75":{"dur":1,"text":"who raised their hand and said,"},"76":{"dur":2,"text":"\"How do we know that the person\nwho made that number"},"79":{"dur":1,"text":"isn't one of the 49 percent either?\""},"81":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"82":{"dur":4,"text":"So clearly, there's a numeracy issue,"},"86":{"dur":2,"text":"because these are\nimportant skills for life,"},"88":{"dur":3,"text":"and a lot of the changes\nthat we want to introduce in this century"},"92":{"dur":2,"text":"involve us becoming\nmore comfortable with numbers."},"95":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, it's not just an English problem."},"96":{"dur":4,"text":"OECD this year released some figures\nlooking at numeracy in young people,"},"101":{"dur":2,"text":"and leading the way, the USA --"},"104":{"dur":4,"text":"nearly 40 percent of young people\nin the US have low numeracy."},"109":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, England is there too,"},"110":{"dur":5,"text":"but there are seven OECD countries\nwith figures above 20 percent."},"115":{"dur":2,"text":"That is a problem,\nbecause it doesn't have to be that way."},"118":{"dur":2,"text":"If you look at the far end of this graph,"},"120":{"dur":2,"text":"you can see the Netherlands and Korea\nare in single figures."},"124":{"dur":4,"text":"So there's definitely a numeracy\nproblem that we want to address."},"128":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, as useful as studies like these are,"},"131":{"dur":5,"text":"I think we risk herding people\ninadvertently into one of two categories;"},"136":{"dur":1,"text":"that there are two kinds of people:"},"138":{"dur":4,"text":"those people that are comfortable\nwith numbers, that can do numbers,"},"143":{"dur":2,"text":"and the people who can't."},"145":{"dur":2,"text":"And what I'm trying\nto talk about here today"},"147":{"dur":3,"text":"is to say that I believe\nthat is a false dichotomy."},"150":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not an immutable pairing."},"152":{"dur":3,"text":"I think you don't have to have\ntremendously high levels of numeracy"},"156":{"dur":1,"text":"to be inspired by numbers,"},"157":{"dur":3,"text":"and that should be the starting point\nto the journey ahead."},"161":{"dur":4,"text":"And one of the ways in which\nwe can begin that journey, for me,"},"165":{"dur":1,"text":"is looking at statistics."},"167":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, I am the first to acknowledge\nthat statistics has got somewhat"},"171":{"dur":1,"text":"of an image problem."},"172":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"173":{"dur":1,"text":"It's the part of mathematics"},"174":{"dur":3,"text":"that even mathematicians\ndon't particularly like,"},"178":{"dur":4,"text":"because whereas the rest of maths\nis all about precision and certainty,"},"182":{"dur":2,"text":"statistics is almost the reverse of that."},"184":{"dur":4,"text":"But actually, I was a late convert\nto the world of statistics myself."},"189":{"dur":2,"text":"If you'd asked my undergraduate professors"},"191":{"dur":4,"text":"what two subjects would I be least likely\nto excel in after university,"},"196":{"dur":2,"text":"they'd have told you statistics\nand computer programming,"},"199":{"dur":2,"text":"and yet here I am, about to show you\nsome statistical graphics"},"202":{"dur":1,"text":"that I programmed."},"203":{"dur":1,"text":"So what inspired that change in me?"},"205":{"dur":3,"text":"What made me think that statistics\nwas actually an interesting thing?"},"209":{"dur":2,"text":"It's really because\nstatistics are about us."},"211":{"dur":2,"text":"If you look at the etymology\nof the word statistics,"},"214":{"dur":2,"text":"it's the science of dealing with data"},"217":{"dur":2,"text":"about the state or the community\nthat we live in."},"219":{"dur":3,"text":"So statistics are about us as a group,"},"222":{"dur":1,"text":"not us as individuals."},"224":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think as social animals,"},"226":{"dur":3,"text":"we share this fascination about how\nwe as individuals relate to our groups,"},"230":{"dur":1,"text":"to our peers."},"231":{"dur":3,"text":"And statistics in this way\nare at their most powerful"},"234":{"dur":1,"text":"when they surprise us."},"236":{"dur":3,"text":"And there's been some really wonderful\nsurveys carried out recently"},"239":{"dur":1,"text":"by Ipsos MORI in the last few years."},"241":{"dur":2,"text":"They did some really interesting stuff."},"244":{"dur":2,"text":"They did a survey\nof over 1,000 adults in the UK,"},"246":{"dur":4,"text":"and said, for every 100 people\nin England and Wales,"},"251":{"dur":1,"text":"how many of them are Muslim?"},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"Now the average answer from this survey,"},"256":{"dur":3,"text":"which was supposed to be representative\nof the total population ..."},"260":{"dur":1,"text":"was 24."},"262":{"dur":1,"text":"That's what people thought."},"264":{"dur":3,"text":"British people think 24 out of every 100\npeople in the country are Muslim."},"267":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, official figures reveal\nthat figure to be about five."},"273":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's this big variation\nbetween what we think, our perception,"},"277":{"dur":2,"text":"and the reality as given by statistics."},"279":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think that's interesting."},"280":{"dur":3,"text":"What could possibly be causing\nthat misperception?"},"284":{"dur":1,"text":"And I was so thrilled with this study,"},"286":{"dur":3,"text":"I started to take questions out\nin presentations. I was referring to it."},"290":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, I did a presentation"},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"at St. Paul's School for Girls\nin Hammersmith,"},"293":{"dur":2,"text":"and I had an audience rather like this,"},"295":{"dur":3,"text":"except it was comprised entirely\nof sixth-form girls."},"299":{"dur":2,"text":"And I said, \"Girls,"},"303":{"dur":4,"text":"how many teenage girls do you think\nthe British public think"},"307":{"dur":1,"text":"get pregnant every year?\""},"309":{"dur":2,"text":"And the girls were apoplectic when I said"},"312":{"dur":3,"text":"the British public think that 15\nout of every 100 teenage girls"},"316":{"dur":1,"text":"get pregnant in the year."},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"And they had every right to be angry,"},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"because in fact, I'd have to have\ncloser to 200 dots"},"323":{"dur":1,"text":"before I could color one in,"},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"in terms of what\nthe official figures tell us."},"328":{"dur":3,"text":"And rather like numeracy,\nthis is not just an English problem."},"331":{"dur":4,"text":"Ipsos MORI expanded the survey\nin recent years to go across the world."},"336":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, they asked Saudi Arabians,"},"340":{"dur":2,"text":"for every 100 adults in your country,"},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"how many of them are overweight or obese?"},"346":{"dur":5,"text":"And the average answer from the Saudis\nwas just over a quarter."},"352":{"dur":1,"text":"That's what they thought."},"353":{"dur":2,"text":"Just over a quarter of adults\nare overweight or obese."},"356":{"dur":4,"text":"The official figures show, actually,\nit's nearer to three-quarters."},"361":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"So again, a big variation."},"365":{"dur":4,"text":"And I love this one: they asked in Japan,\nthey asked the Japanese,"},"369":{"dur":1,"text":"for every 100 Japanese people,"},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"how many of them live in rural areas?"},"374":{"dur":4,"text":"The average was about a 50-50 split,\njust over halfway."},"379":{"dur":4,"text":"They thought 56 out of every 100\nJapanese people lived in rural areas."},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"The official figure is seven."},"387":{"dur":4,"text":"So extraordinary variations,\nand surprising to some,"},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"but not surprising to people\nwho have read the work"},"394":{"dur":4,"text":"of Daniel Kahneman, for example,\nthe Nobel-winning economist."},"398":{"dur":5,"text":"He and his colleague, Amos Tversky,\nspent years researching this disjoint"},"403":{"dur":3,"text":"between what people perceive\nand the reality,"},"406":{"dur":3,"text":"the fact that people are actually\npretty poor intuitive statisticians."},"410":{"dur":1,"text":"And there are many reasons for this."},"412":{"dur":3,"text":"Individual experiences, certainly,\ncan influence our perceptions,"},"415":{"dur":3,"text":"but so, too, can things like the media\nreporting things by exception,"},"419":{"dur":1,"text":"rather than what's normal."},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"Kahneman had a nice way\nof referring to that."},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"He said, \"We can be blind\nto the obvious\" --"},"426":{"dur":1,"text":"so we've got the numbers wrong --"},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"\"but we can be blind\nto our blindness about it.\""},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"And that has enormous\nrepercussions for decision making."},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"So at the statistics office\nwhile this was all going on,"},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"I thought this was really interesting."},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"I said, this is clearly a global problem,"},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"but maybe geography is the issue here."},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"These were questions that were all about,\nhow well do you know your country?"},"448":{"dur":3,"text":"So in this case, it's how well\ndo you know 64 million people?"},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"Not very well, it turns out.\nI can't do that."},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"So I had an idea,"},"456":{"dur":3,"text":"which was to think about\nthis same sort of approach"},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"but to think about it\nin a very local sense."},"462":{"dur":1,"text":"Is this a local?"},"463":{"dur":1,"text":"If we reframe the questions and say,"},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"how well do you know your local area,"},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"would your answers be any more accurate?"},"471":{"dur":1,"text":"So I devised a quiz:"},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"How well do you know your area?"},"475":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a simple Web app."},"477":{"dur":1,"text":"You put in a post code"},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"and then it will ask you questions\nbased on census data"},"481":{"dur":1,"text":"for your local area."},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was very conscious\nin designing this."},"485":{"dur":4,"text":"I wanted to make it open\nto the widest possible range of people,"},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"not just the 49 percent\nwho can get the numbers."},"492":{"dur":1,"text":"I wanted everyone to engage with it."},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"So for the design of the quiz,"},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"I was inspired by the isotypes"},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"of Otto Neurath from the 1920s and '30s."},"502":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, these are methods\nfor representing numbers"},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"using repeating icons."},"510":{"dur":3,"text":"And the numbers are there,\nbut they sit in the background."},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's a great way\nof representing quantity"},"515":{"dur":2,"text":"without resorting to using terms\nlike \"percentage,\""},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"\"fractions\" and \"ratios.\""},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"So here's the quiz."},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"The layout of the quiz is,"},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"you have your repeating icons\non the left-hand side there,"},"527":{"dur":3,"text":"and a map showing you the area\nwe're asking you questions about"},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"on the right-hand side."},"531":{"dur":1,"text":"There are seven questions."},"532":{"dur":3,"text":"Each question, there's a possible answer\nbetween zero and a hundred,"},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"and at the end of the quiz,"},"538":{"dur":3,"text":"you get an overall score\nbetween zero and a hundred."},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"And so because this is TEDxExeter,"},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"I thought we would have\na quick look at the quiz"},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"for the first few questions of Exeter."},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"And so the first question is:"},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"For every 100 people,\nhow many are aged under 16?"},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, I don't know Exeter very well\nat all, so I had a guess at this,"},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"but it gives you an idea\nof how this quiz works."},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"You drag the slider\nto highlight your icons,"},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"and then just click \"Submit\" to answer,"},"565":{"dur":3,"text":"and we animate away the difference\nbetween your answer and reality."},"569":{"dur":4,"text":"And it turns out, I was a pretty\nterrible guess: five."},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"How about the next question?"},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"This is asking about\nwhat the average age is,"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"so the age at which half\nthe population are younger"},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"and half the population are older."},"581":{"dur":3,"text":"And I thought 35 -- that sounds\nmiddle-aged to me."},"584":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"Actually, in Exeter,\nit's incredibly young,"},"590":{"dur":4,"text":"and I had underestimated the impact\nof the university in this area."},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"The questions get harder\nas you go through."},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"So this one's now asking\nabout homeownership:"},"600":{"dur":3,"text":"For every 100 households, how many\nare owned with a mortgage or loan?"},"604":{"dur":1,"text":"And I hedged my bets here,"},"605":{"dur":3,"text":"because I didn't want to be\nmore than 50 out on the answer."},"608":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"And actually, these get harder,\nthese questions,"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"because when you're in an area,\nwhen you're in a community,"},"615":{"dur":5,"text":"things like age -- there are clues\nto whether a population is old or young."},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"Just by looking around\nthe area, you can see it."},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"Something like homeownership\nis much more difficult to see,"},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"so we revert to our own heuristics,"},"629":{"dur":4,"text":"our own biases about how many people\nwe think own their own homes."},"634":{"dur":3,"text":"Now the truth is,\nwhen we published this quiz,"},"637":{"dur":3,"text":"the census data that it's based on\nwas already a few years old."},"641":{"dur":3,"text":"We've had online applications\nthat allow you to put in a post code"},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"and get statistics back for years."},"647":{"dur":1,"text":"So in some senses,"},"648":{"dur":3,"text":"this was all a little bit old\nand not necessarily new."},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"But I was interested to see\nwhat reaction we might get"},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"by gamifying the data\nin the way that we have,"},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"by using animation"},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"and playing on the fact\nthat people have their own preconceptions."},"665":{"dur":3,"text":"It turns out, the reaction was, um ..."},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"was more than I could have hoped for."},"673":{"dur":3,"text":"It was a long-held ambition of mine\nto bring down a statistics website"},"676":{"dur":1,"text":"due to public demand."},"678":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"This URL contains the words\n\"statistics,\" \"gov\" and \"UK,\""},"683":{"dur":3,"text":"which are three of people's least\nfavorite words in a URL."},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"And the amazing thing about this\nwas that the website came down"},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"at quarter to 10 at night,"},"692":{"dur":3,"text":"because people were actually\nengaging with this data"},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"of their own free will,"},"697":{"dur":1,"text":"using their own personal time."},"699":{"dur":1,"text":"I was very interested to see"},"701":{"dur":3,"text":"that we got something like\na quarter of a million people"},"705":{"dur":3,"text":"playing the quiz within the space\nof 48 hours of launching it."},"708":{"dur":3,"text":"And it sparked an enormous discussion\nonline, on social media,"},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"which was largely dominated"},"714":{"dur":3,"text":"by people having fun\nwith their misconceptions,"},"718":{"dur":3,"text":"which is something that\nI couldn't have hoped for any better,"},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"in some respects."},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"I also liked the fact that people started\nsending it to politicians."},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"How well do you know the area\nyou claim to represent?"},"728":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"729":{"dur":1,"text":"And then just to finish,"},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"going back to the two kinds of people,"},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"I thought it would be\nreally interesting to see"},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"how people who are good with numbers\nwould do on this quiz."},"739":{"dur":3,"text":"The national statistician\nof England and Wales, John Pullinger,"},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"you would expect he would be pretty good."},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"He got 44 for his own area."},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"(Laughter)"},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"Jeremy Paxman -- admittedly,\nafter a glass of wine ..."},"755":{"dur":1,"text":"36."},"757":{"dur":1,"text":"Even worse."},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"It just shows you that the numbers\ncan inspire us all."},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"They can surprise us all."},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"So very often, we talk about statistics"},"765":{"dur":1,"text":"as being the science of uncertainty."},"767":{"dur":1,"text":"My parting thought for today is:"},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"actually, statistics is the science of us."},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's why we should\nbe fascinated by numbers."},"774":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you very much."},"775":{"dur":4,"text":"(Applause)"}}
