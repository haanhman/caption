you\nabout the new item GG0170C."},"36":{"dur":4,"text":"As you've heard today, this is a new measure\nthat is a covariate."},"41":{"dur":7,"text":"And that's a popular term today that does\nimpact the quality measure for percent of"},"49":{"dur":8,"text":"patients that have pressure ulcers that are\nnew or worsened."},"57":{"dur":5,"text":"So what we're going to be talking about today\nis really demonstrating a working knowledge"},"62":{"dur":1,"text":"of this new item."},"63":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm sure you've all heard about it."},"65":{"dur":1,"text":"What is it?"},"67":{"dur":2,"text":"GG0170C, mobility."},"70":{"dur":5,"text":"This is talking about moving from lying to\nsitting on the side of the bed, which is not"},"75":{"dur":2,"text":"new for any of us in home care."},"77":{"dur":1,"text":"It's just a new measure."},"78":{"dur":5,"text":"And we're going to be talking about really\nthe intent of the measure, how to interpret"},"84":{"dur":9,"text":"the coding options for GG0170C, and then apply\nthose instructions as Ann ended her presentation."},"93":{"dur":5,"text":"It's so important that you leave here today\nwith action steps so that you can instruct"},"99":{"dur":1,"text":"your staff."},"100":{"dur":5,"text":"So that is our objective, is that you will\nleave with that information following the"},"105":{"dur":3,"text":"presentation."},"109":{"dur":6,"text":"We did want to clarify, and you've heard Ann\nmention several times about code and coding."},"115":{"dur":6,"text":"We just wanted to clarify that in home care\nwe talk about coders, often about our ICD-10"},"121":{"dur":5,"text":"coders, those very special people that have\nthat training in ICD-10 coding."},"127":{"dur":4,"text":"We are talking, as I think you all know, about\nscoring the OASIS."},"131":{"dur":8,"text":"So the word \"code\" and \"coding\" is synonymous\nwith scoring."},"140":{"dur":5,"text":"So we talked a lot about the quality measure\ncovariates."},"145":{"dur":7,"text":"Both Nicole Keane and Ann Spenard talked about\ncovariates, that they are one of the three"},"152":{"dur":2,"text":"risk adjustment types."},"155":{"dur":7,"text":"And that they are patient characteristics\nthat affect a certain outcome for our patients."},"162":{"dur":6,"text":"And the items that you see on the screen here,\nAnn Spenard mentioned these, M1028, which"},"169":{"dur":7,"text":"is active diagnosis, 1060, height and weight,\nand 1620, bowel incontinence."},"176":{"dur":5,"text":"Those are three covariates that my colleague\nKathy Roby will be speaking to later today."},"182":{"dur":6,"text":"And we're going to be talking about the fourth,\nwhich is the GG0170C, lying to sitting on"},"189":{"dur":4,"text":"the side of the bed."},"193":{"dur":2,"text":"So you all know this is a new item."},"196":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't know if you've all found it in the\nOASIS."},"198":{"dur":9,"text":"I just thought I'd orient you it's in the\nADL\/IADLs section and found in between M1850,"},"207":{"dur":10,"text":"which is transferring, and before M1860, which\nis ambulation and locomotion."},"218":{"dur":8,"text":"And the item intent, so we read specifically\nwhat GG0170C says, which is, it identifies"},"226":{"dur":6,"text":"the patient's need for assistance with the\nmobility task of moving from lying on the"},"233":{"dur":7,"text":"back, to sitting on the side of the bed with\nfeet flat on the floor, with no back support."},"240":{"dur":4,"text":"So that's a real formal way of saying what\nwe do every day in home care."},"244":{"dur":7,"text":"We go in and we always want to assess how\nis the patient at moving from a lying position"},"251":{"dur":5,"text":"to sitting on the side of the bed and safely\nsitting with their feet on the floor."},"256":{"dur":3,"text":"That's something that we've been assessing\nfor years now."},"260":{"dur":6,"text":"But what's important, that this is a new measure\nthat's going to help us to quantify this and"},"266":{"dur":4,"text":"one of the IMPACT Act measures that we've\nall talked about."},"270":{"dur":5,"text":"So that we're going to have a consistent way\nof identifying the patient's ability to perform"},"276":{"dur":6,"text":"this task and whether they can do it by themselves,\nor whether they need assistance in doing that."},"283":{"dur":5,"text":"By using this measure, and again this is across\nall settings as the other speakers have talked"},"288":{"dur":4,"text":"about, we're going to have the uniformity\nof this data."},"292":{"dur":3,"text":"It will have that interoperability that's\nso important."},"296":{"dur":5,"text":"And also, this whole covariate piece, so that\nit's really looking at how does the patient's"},"302":{"dur":9,"text":"mobility impact the risk for pressure ulcers\nthat Ann Spenard spoke to earlier."},"311":{"dur":4,"text":"So the rationale I think has been talked about\nand we've all heard about in nursing school"},"316":{"dur":1,"text":"for many years."},"317":{"dur":6,"text":"And in our experience that it's no news that\nimmobility can lead to a higher risk for pressure"},"323":{"dur":1,"text":"ulcer."},"324":{"dur":2,"text":"It can adversely affect wound healing."},"327":{"dur":4,"text":"And it also can increase your risk for development\nof pressure ulcers."},"331":{"dur":11,"text":"So obviously, that's one of the main reasons\nwhy we're looking at GG0170C."},"342":{"dur":3,"text":"And what time points is this?"},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm sorry."},"348":{"dur":4,"text":"I didn't push the button."},"353":{"dur":1,"text":"Sorry."},"354":{"dur":2,"text":"What time points are we completing this?"},"356":{"dur":5,"text":"We're doing this at the start of care, which\nas we all know is within five days of the"},"361":{"dur":1,"text":"start of care date."},"363":{"dur":4,"text":"And we're doing this at the resumption of\ncare, which is within 48 hours of a return"},"367":{"dur":6,"text":"to home after an inpatient facility discharge."},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"So how do we complete this?"},"376":{"dur":1,"text":"How do we obtain this information?"},"378":{"dur":3,"text":"What are the steps for the assessment for\nGG0170C?"},"382":{"dur":7,"text":"The first, obviously is to observe and assess\nthe patient's ability to do this."},"390":{"dur":4,"text":"This is our greatest skill, one of our greatest\nskills in home health."},"394":{"dur":3,"text":"So have the patient perform the task."},"398":{"dur":3,"text":"We also want to get as full a picture as possible."},"401":{"dur":5,"text":"So obviously, ask the family members or the\ncaregivers how does the patient perform this"},"407":{"dur":1,"text":"task?"},"408":{"dur":6,"text":"So you're pulling all of the information together\nto assess what their ability is to move from"},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"lying to sitting on the side of the bed."},"418":{"dur":7,"text":"Again, the patient should be allowed to do\nthis independently, as much as they can, as"},"425":{"dur":1,"text":"long as it's safe."},"427":{"dur":6,"text":"And that's always a key factor for us in any\ncare setting is that we want to ensure that"},"433":{"dur":7,"text":"the patient is safe performing any of the\nactivities that we're asking them to do."},"440":{"dur":6,"text":"But if caregiver assistance is required because\nit's unsafe for them to do it themselves,"},"447":{"dur":7,"text":"we're going to be responding and scoring GG0170C\nbased on how much assistance do they require?"},"454":{"dur":11,"text":"And we'll be going through the scoring as\nto how you would do that."},"466":{"dur":5,"text":"Another important piece that we need to make\nnote of is the use of an assistive device"},"471":{"dur":6,"text":"and the fact that with GG0170C, the patient\ncan use an assistive device."},"478":{"dur":4,"text":"And that does not change the scoring at all\nfor this measure."},"483":{"dur":6,"text":"So if a patient needs to push off their bedside\ntable, that could be considered an assistive"},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"device."},"491":{"dur":1,"text":"That would not impact the scoring."},"493":{"dur":4,"text":"If they can do that independently, you would\nstill score them as independent."},"497":{"dur":6,"text":"I also, with a colleague, she received home\nphysical therapy."},"503":{"dur":7,"text":"Her physical therapist in home care instructed\nher to use a belt to move her legs from lying"},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"to the side of the bed."},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"That would still be considered independent."},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"She was able to perform that activity."},"518":{"dur":5,"text":"The assistive device of a belt or a strap,\nor whatever it is that the patient needs to"},"524":{"dur":6,"text":"use to move safely, independently from lying\nto sitting is still considered acceptable"},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"and does not impact the scoring."},"532":{"dur":5,"text":"So they would still be considered independent\nin that activity."},"538":{"dur":6,"text":"And the last step that we want to highlight\nfor you is that the patient's performance"},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"many times can vary."},"546":{"dur":5,"text":"So what we're looking for in the guidance\nfrom CMS is that we're looking at the patient's"},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"usual status."},"554":{"dur":6,"text":"So we wouldn't be taking their best performance,\nor maybe that one time that they really couldn't"},"560":{"dur":6,"text":"get out of that lying position because maybe\nthey had a bad night's sleep."},"566":{"dur":10,"text":"You want to take the patient's usual performance\nas the scoring for this measure."},"577":{"dur":7,"text":"So this is a screenshot of how the measure\ndoes appear on the OASIS."},"584":{"dur":5,"text":"You can see on the top, it does give you the\ncoding instructions for both the start of"},"590":{"dur":4,"text":"care performance, the SOC\/ROC Performance\nscoring."},"595":{"dur":6,"text":"And then also looking at coding the patient's\nDischarge Goal, and which coding items you"},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"can use for that."},"604":{"dur":4,"text":"On the left, you'll see the coding options\nthat you have."},"608":{"dur":4,"text":"And we'll be going into each of those in a\nfew minutes."},"613":{"dur":7,"text":"And the highlighted area, number one, so this\nis GG0170C1 which is the yellow column that"},"620":{"dur":6,"text":"you see, that will be the score that you give\nfor the SOC\/ROC Performance."},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"The second column is the Discharge Goal."},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"And you'll be determining that at the same\ntime."},"633":{"dur":6,"text":"But again, you're going to be using the patient's\ninput, your assessment, and the caregiver's"},"640":{"dur":2,"text":"to score the patient's Discharge Goal."},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"And again we'll be getting\ninto that."},"646":{"dur":4,"text":"But the measure, and again this is on the\nfar right side, looking at the definition"},"651":{"dur":3,"text":"of what we're actually trying to score here."},"654":{"dur":5,"text":"It's the patient's ability to safely move\nfrom lying on their back to sitting on the"},"660":{"dur":5,"text":"side of the bed with their feet flat on the\nfloor and no back support."},"666":{"dur":4,"text":"So that's really not rocket science if you\ntry to break it down."},"671":{"dur":4,"text":"And we just need to score them as to how well\nthey can do that on their own, or how much"},"675":{"dur":5,"text":"assistance that they need to perform that\nactivity."},"681":{"dur":7,"text":"So the coding instructions, we do have a 6-point\nscale that is pretty self explanatory."},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"We're going to go through each of those."},"691":{"dur":5,"text":"Code 06 is if the patient can perform this\nactivity independently."},"696":{"dur":5,"text":"Code 05 would be if they require setup or\nclean-up assistance."},"702":{"dur":7,"text":"Code 04 would be supervision or touching assistance."},"709":{"dur":4,"text":"Code 03 for partial or moderate assistance."},"713":{"dur":4,"text":"Code 02 is for substantial or maximal assistance."},"718":{"dur":5,"text":"And then Code 01 would be for a dependent\n-- excuse me, for a dependent patient would"},"724":{"dur":4,"text":"be Code 01."},"728":{"dur":7,"text":"And we do have options for if the patient\n-- we do not attempt this activity for a variety"},"735":{"dur":5,"text":"of reasons, or if the caregiver that is there\nto help the patient, we did not attempt the"},"741":{"dur":1,"text":"activity."},"743":{"dur":5,"text":"Those would be Code 07, which is when a patient\nwould refuse to do this."},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"Code 09 would be used if it's not applicable."},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"And again we'll get into the details of that."},"755":{"dur":12,"text":"And Code 88 would be used if it was not attempted\nbecause of a medical condition or safety concerns."},"767":{"dur":5,"text":"So looking at the actual screenshot of the\nmeasure, you can see the highlighted area"},"773":{"dur":3,"text":"which is the Code 06 for independent."},"776":{"dur":5,"text":"And this is, as I described earlier, if the\npatient can complete the activity by him or"},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"herself without any human assistance whatsoever."},"785":{"dur":5,"text":"So there would be no caregiver helping in\nany way."},"790":{"dur":3,"text":"The patient wakes up, and their alarm goes\noff."},"793":{"dur":5,"text":"And they're able to get up from lying to sitting\non the side of the bed and get their feet"},"799":{"dur":1,"text":"on the floor without any assistance."},"801":{"dur":5,"text":"That would be a Code 06, independent."},"807":{"dur":4,"text":"Code 05 is used for a setup or clean-up assistance."},"812":{"dur":6,"text":"And that's a fancy way of talking about a\npatient that really can do it pretty much"},"818":{"dur":5,"text":"independently, but prior to doing the activity,\nor immediately after the activity, they might"},"824":{"dur":3,"text":"need some setup assistance."},"827":{"dur":6,"text":"So an example of this would be a patient that\nrequires a sling on their shoulder to get"},"834":{"dur":4,"text":"up and they need a caregiver to help put that\nsling on."},"838":{"dur":5,"text":"So once the caregiver goes over and places\nthat sling on the patient, the patient's able"},"843":{"dur":3,"text":"to get up and swing their legs over and put\ntheir feet down."},"846":{"dur":3,"text":"So that would be a score 05."},"849":{"dur":5,"text":"Another example would be a patient that is\nunable to put the bedding, put their covers"},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"down at the bottom of the bed."},"858":{"dur":3,"text":"They can't get their feet untangled from their\ncovers."},"862":{"dur":4,"text":"So the caregiver would have to pull down the\ncovers and then the patient would be able"},"867":{"dur":4,"text":"to move their legs to the side of the bed\nsafely."},"871":{"dur":7,"text":"Another example, which was one of the questions\nthat had come up on the CMS site was for a"},"878":{"dur":2,"text":"patient that can't reach the floor."},"881":{"dur":5,"text":"My mom is like 4 foot 10 and she can't reach\nthe floor when she sits up."},"886":{"dur":2,"text":"She's so cute, little Italian lady."},"888":{"dur":1,"text":"We love her."},"889":{"dur":4,"text":"(Laughter) And we would need the put a little\nstool on the floor for her just so she could"},"894":{"dur":4,"text":"get her feet, especially when she comes to\nvisit me, because my bed is higher than her"},"898":{"dur":1,"text":"bed at home."},"900":{"dur":4,"text":"But that would be a setup so that she could\ndo the activity safely."},"904":{"dur":2,"text":"Again, it's not doing it for the patient."},"907":{"dur":6,"text":"You're not assisting them, other than to give\nthem assistance for setup and then maybe remove"},"913":{"dur":1,"text":"that stool."},"914":{"dur":1,"text":"So that would be the cleanup."},"916":{"dur":4,"text":"And you would score that patient as a 05,\njust needing that little bit of assistance"},"921":{"dur":6,"text":"prior to or after the activity."},"928":{"dur":4,"text":"Code 04 is used --- and again, we're going\nup in terms of assistance."},"933":{"dur":6,"text":"This would be used when the patient needs\nsome supervision or touching assistance."},"940":{"dur":4,"text":"And I know you're all picturing the little\nold lady in your head that you've seen, right,"},"944":{"dur":4,"text":"that is just laying in bed and needs maybe\na little coaxing, a little encouragement,"},"949":{"dur":1,"text":"you know \"you can do this.\""},"950":{"dur":5,"text":"Maybe putting your hand on their shoulder\nto just guide them, but really not physically"},"955":{"dur":6,"text":"helping them move from lying to sitting, but\njust coaxing them, giving them some supervision,"},"962":{"dur":1,"text":"some encouragement."},"964":{"dur":7,"text":"This would be a Code 04 . So again, it's assistance\nthat could be provided throughout the activity,"},"971":{"dur":5,"text":"or it could be provided just intermittently,\nor just at the beginning of the activity to"},"976":{"dur":7,"text":"just coax them and encourage them to move\nand get from lying to sitting on the side"},"983":{"dur":1,"text":"of the bed."},"985":{"dur":6,"text":"So again, it's an encouragement and supervision\nso that the patient will perform the activity,"},"992":{"dur":7,"text":"and that you're making sure that they're safe\nto do that."},"999":{"dur":4,"text":"Code 03 is used for partial or moderate assistance."},"1004":{"dur":4,"text":"And the keywords here, and you're going to\nbe hearing this for the next coding is the"},"1009":{"dur":1,"text":"\"amount of effort.\""},"1011":{"dur":9,"text":"So for Code 03, the partial or moderate assistance,\nwe're really looking at a patient that really"},"1020":{"dur":2,"text":"does more than half the effort."},"1022":{"dur":4,"text":"So the caregiver is providing less than half\nof the effort."},"1026":{"dur":6,"text":"So the caregiver could be lifting their trunk,\nhelping them move up to a sitting position."},"1033":{"dur":4,"text":"They could be lifting the legs a little bit\nto help them slide them over so that they"},"1038":{"dur":2,"text":"can put them, their feet on the floor."},"1041":{"dur":1,"text":"But it's less than half the effort."},"1042":{"dur":2,"text":"The patient's doing more than half."},"1045":{"dur":2,"text":"So again, that's a clinical judgment."},"1048":{"dur":4,"text":"But seeing whether it's less than half or\nmore than half is the distinction between"},"1053":{"dur":7,"text":"Code 03 and Code 02."},"1060":{"dur":5,"text":"So I've answered for Code 02, which is when\nthe caregiver does provide more than half"},"1066":{"dur":6,"text":"of the effort to move from sitting or lying\nto sitting on the side of bed."},"1072":{"dur":5,"text":"Again, the patient would be providing less\nthan half, so that the caregiver's really"},"1077":{"dur":3,"text":"doing more of the work than the patient is."},"1081":{"dur":8,"text":"And this is done again throughout the activity,\nboth Code 03 and Code 02 are support assistance"},"1089":{"dur":5,"text":"that the caregiver is providing throughout\nthe entire activity."},"1094":{"dur":6,"text":"This is compared to when they were providing\njust some cuing assistance or contact-guard"},"1100":{"dur":1,"text":"assistance."},"1101":{"dur":1,"text":"That could be intermittent."},"1103":{"dur":5,"text":"And the code that we talked about whether\nyou would do setup, that was really prior"},"1108":{"dur":1,"text":"to and after."},"1109":{"dur":6,"text":"So Code 03 and 02 are, they need assistance\nthroughout that whole movement to get from"},"1116":{"dur":6,"text":"lying to sitting on the side of the bed."},"1122":{"dur":2,"text":"And the last numeric code is Code 01."},"1125":{"dur":4,"text":"And that is for a dependent patient."},"1129":{"dur":6,"text":"This would be the patients that we know that\ncan't perform this activity at all."},"1135":{"dur":4,"text":"They would need 100% assistance."},"1140":{"dur":6,"text":"It would be by one caregiver, or it could\nbe two or three caregivers that are required"},"1146":{"dur":5,"text":"to get the patient from a lying to sitting\nposition with their feet on the floor."},"1152":{"dur":7,"text":"Again, this would obviously be someone that\ngets this assistance throughout the activity."},"1159":{"dur":5,"text":"So the caregiver or the family member would\nbe, you know, really providing all of that"},"1165":{"dur":10,"text":"assistance, doing all the effort for the patient\nso that they could complete this."},"1175":{"dur":6,"text":"So now we're moving on to the coding options,\nif the activity was not attempted and why"},"1181":{"dur":6,"text":"that would be justified and an appropriate\ncode or score to use."},"1187":{"dur":5,"text":"So Code 07 is when a patient refuses to complete\nthe activity."},"1193":{"dur":5,"text":"I'm sure all of you have patients that participate\nand cooperate 100% of the time, right?"},"1198":{"dur":3,"text":"(Laughter) That would be a wonderful world\nthat we'd live in."},"1201":{"dur":1,"text":"But we don't."},"1203":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's home care, and we know that we have\nall sorts of wonderful challenges."},"1208":{"dur":3,"text":"Actually we have that in all of our care settings."},"1211":{"dur":1,"text":"Pretty self explanatory."},"1212":{"dur":6,"text":"If the patient refuses to do this activity,\nand we know that we've had those, that patient"},"1219":{"dur":7,"text":"would be scored a 07, that they just refused\nto perform the activity."},"1227":{"dur":3,"text":"So Code 09 would be, not applicable."},"1230":{"dur":4,"text":"And this is really for a patient that would\nnot have been able to perform this activity"},"1234":{"dur":4,"text":"prior to the reason why we're providing home\ncare for them."},"1239":{"dur":5,"text":"So this would be your patient that would never\nhave been able to do this before, they maybe"},"1244":{"dur":6,"text":"had their knee replacement or whatever reason\nyou're in providing home care services for"},"1251":{"dur":1,"text":"them."},"1252":{"dur":6,"text":"So it wouldn't be applicable that we're in\nproviding a new episode of care to expect"},"1258":{"dur":3,"text":"that they would be able to do this, because\nthey couldn't do it before."},"1262":{"dur":1,"text":"So that would be a code of 09."},"1264":{"dur":7,"text":"And it would be not applicable."},"1272":{"dur":5,"text":"And Code 88 would be if the activity was not\nattempted."},"1277":{"dur":5,"text":"This would be due to a medical condition or\na safety concern that would prevent the clinician"},"1283":{"dur":2,"text":"from performing this activity."},"1286":{"dur":6,"text":"So this would be an appropriate code to use\nif their medical condition really prohibited"},"1292":{"dur":8,"text":"the patient from performing that activity."},"1300":{"dur":6,"text":"And the last coding option is the dash, which\nAnn Spenard had talked about earlier."},"1307":{"dur":10,"text":"The dash is a valid response for GG0170C1\nwhich is the SOC\/ROC Performance coding."},"1318":{"dur":4,"text":"It is a very rare occurrence that you would\nuse the dash."},"1322":{"dur":6,"text":"And CMS would expect that you really are not\nusing this as a frequent response."},"1328":{"dur":7,"text":"It would really most often occur if the patient\nwas unexpectedly transferred, or discharged,"},"1335":{"dur":4,"text":"or died prior to the assessment item being\ncompleted."},"1340":{"dur":9,"text":"So in that instance, it would be appropriate\nto use the dash."},"1349":{"dur":7,"text":"So some of the key coding questions that you\ncan use to help your clinician's, your nurses"},"1357":{"dur":6,"text":"decide how are they going to answer these\nquestions, a good way to approach it would"},"1363":{"dur":8,"text":"be, well, what questions could you ask yourself\nto help guide you in answering GG0170C accurately?"},"1372":{"dur":2,"text":"So the first question is, does the patient\nneed assistance?"},"1375":{"dur":2,"text":"That would be the first line."},"1378":{"dur":6,"text":"And obviously, if you said, no, the patient\ndoesn't require any assistance at all, then"},"1384":{"dur":5,"text":"this scoring would be 06, because they're\nindependent."},"1389":{"dur":4,"text":"If the clinician asked themselves, well does\nthe patient need just a setup or

sitting?"},"1403":{"dur":6,"text":"That would be the -- the belt would be a 06,\nthat would be independent."},"1409":{"dur":5,"text":"But if the patient needed setup, they need\nclean-up, they need the nurse or the caregiver"},"1415":{"dur":5,"text":"to help put a stool down as we described earlier,\nthen the answer would be, yes."},"1420":{"dur":6,"text":"It would be a Code

the effort?"},"1497":{"dur":5,"text":"If it's less than half, so the patient is\ndoing more of the effort, then the nurse would"},"1502":{"dur":1,"text":"say, yes."},"1503":{"dur":5,"text":"It's a Code 03."},"1509":{"dur":3,"text":"And in contrast to that would be Code 02."},"1512":{"dur":4,"text":"So does the patient need the caregiver to\ndo more than half of the

can arrive"},"1526":{"dur":4,"text":"at the proper code, whether it was more than\nhalf the effort."},"1531":{"dur":5,"text":"And when it's more than half, it would be\na code of 02, which is

question\nthat the nurses should be thinking to themselves"},"1550":{"dur":3,"text":"is, does the helper provide all of the effort?"},"1554":{"dur":7,"text":"And I think many times these dependent patients,\nthat we really have to provide 100% to help"},"1562":{"dur":2,"text":"them get from from lying to sitting on the\nside of the bed."},"1564":{"dur":3,"text":"Those seem to be the clearer scenarios."},"1568":{"dur":4,"text":"That would be obviously a dependent coding."},"1572":{"dur":5,"text":"That would be a Code 01 for dependent to move\nfrom lying to sitting on the side of the

07, which is if the\npatient refused."},"1596":{"dur":3,"text":"You have Code 09, which was the not applicable\ncode."},"1599":{"dur":6,"text":"So if the patient did not perform the activity\nprior to this current illness, you would be"},"1606":{"dur":2,"text":"coding them a 09."},"1608":{"dur":6,"text":"Or Code 88, which would be that you did not\nattempt the activity due to a medical condition"},"1615":{"dur":6,"text":"or a safety concern."},"1621":{"dur":2,"text":"So we do have some coding tips."},"1624":{"dur":7,"text":"And some of these were actually created because\nwe've been very happy to receive questions"},"1631":{"dur":4,"text":"from our home health colleagues throughout\nthe country."},"1635":{"dur":3,"text":"One of the questions, which we thought was\na really great question, and I know you'll"},"1639":{"dur":6,"text":"all be able to relate to is, what if the patient\ndoesn't sleep on a traditional bed?"},"1645":{"dur":4,"text":"And I know we all have those patients that\nlike to sleep in a recliner."},"1650":{"dur":5,"text":"I know my dad was guilty of that very often."},"1656":{"dur":4,"text":"These are patients that just don't like to\nsleep in a traditional bed for whatever reason."},"1660":{"dur":4,"text":"It might be a medical condition or it just\nmight be a preference."},"1664":{"dur":5,"text":"How do we score someone that does not sleep\nin a traditional bed when we're trying to"},"1670":{"dur":4,"text":"measure lying and moving to sitting on the\nside of the bed?"},"1674":{"dur":5,"text":"So we did obtain guidance from CMS on this\nquestion."},"1679":{"dur":7,"text":"And you basically would be scoring the patient\nas they are able to perform the activity in"},"1687":{"dur":3,"text":"this alternate sleep surface."},"1690":{"dur":4,"text":"So if they sleep in a recliner, you would\nbe assessing their ability to move from the"},"1695":{"dur":5,"text":"reclining position, which would be lying for\nthe patient, and how they're able to get up"},"1701":{"dur":3,"text":"and swing their legs over, get their feet\non the floor."},"1704":{"dur":2,"text":"And you would code them based on that."},"1707":{"dur":6,"text":"Again the assistance that they need to move\nfrom that other surface, I actually in home"},"1713":{"dur":5,"text":"health, we had a patient that slept on the\nfloor on a mattress."},"1718":{"dur":1,"text":"They were safe."},"1719":{"dur":1,"text":"It was their preference."},"1721":{"dur":5,"text":"Once we got over that, and I don't know if\nany of you have had patients that slept on"},"1726":{"dur":3,"text":"a mattress on the floor, but this was because\nof a back issue."},"1729":{"dur":2,"text":"And they were most comfortable."},"1731":{"dur":4,"text":"But they were able to get their legs down,\ntheir feet on the floor, and get right up"},"1736":{"dur":2,"text":"from that sleep surface."},"1738":{"dur":1,"text":"That would be independent."},"1740":{"dur":3,"text":"So again, there will take a little bit of\njudgment on this."},"1743":{"dur":7,"text":"But if that is their sleeping surface, that's\nwhat they consider their bed, you would assess"},"1751":{"dur":6,"text":"the measure with the same guidance that we've\ntalked about with the actual traditional bed."},"1757":{"dur":1,"text":"So I hope that that's clear."},"1759":{"dur":8,"text":"And we can talk about any questions if you\nhave questions on that."},"1767":{"dur":2,"text":"So what if the patient's feet don't touch\nthe floor?"},"1770":{"dur":9,"text":"I mentioned that in the example for the setup\nexample for the Code 05, when you put a stool"},"1780":{"dur":1,"text":"under the patient."},"1782":{"dur":3,"text":"But what if the patient, gets up, they're\nable to get from lying."},"1786":{"dur":3,"text":"They're able to swing their legs over by themselves."},"1789":{"dur":5,"text":"And they're able to sit very safely with their\nfeet just hanging without them on the floor."},"1794":{"dur":5,"text":"Is that a independent score for 06?"},"1800":{"dur":1,"text":"It would be."},"1801":{"dur":2,"text":"Because the patient's able to do that safely."},"1804":{"dur":5,"text":"And again, in home care, in all of our care\nsettings, we just need to remember that the"},"1809":{"dur":3,"text":"safety aspect of things, the patient's able\nto do that."},"1813":{"dur":2,"text":"They're safe sitting on the side of the bed."},"1815":{"dur":2,"text":"They don't need any support on their back."},"1818":{"dur":5,"text":"Even though their feet don't touch the floor\ninitially, and they scooch a little bit to"},"1823":{"dur":3,"text":"get their feet to the floor, that would still\nbe independent."},"1827":{"dur":6,"text":"And you would score that a 06."},"1833":{"dur":6,"text":"For the patient with the step stool that I\nmentioned previously, again the assessing"},"1840":{"dur":5,"text":"clinician feels that the patient is not safe\nsitting at the bedside without their feet"},"1845":{"dur":1,"text":"on the floor."},"1846":{"dur":1,"text":"I know we've all seen those patients, right."},"1848":{"dur":6,"text":"They sit up, and they try to swing their legs\nand then they're ready to fall back down."},"1854":{"dur":8,"text":"So a patient that's able to get their feet\nclose to the floor, but they can't reach the"},"1862":{"dur":4,"text":"floor and they're unsteady, and they're going\nto fall back."},"1867":{"dur":6,"text":"So by using a foot stool, you would be able\nto make this activity safe for them."},"1873":{"dur":2,"text":"You would be able to score them a 05."},"1875":{"dur":2,"text":"You wouldn't have to be supporting them."},"1878":{"dur":2,"text":"They're able to get up, get their feet down."},"1880":{"dur":4,"text":"And If you put a stool under their feet it\nwould be safe for them."},"1885":{"dur":10,"text":"So it would be the scoring of a 05 for setup\nand clean-up assistance."},"1896":{"dur":7,"text":"So again, for last but not least coding tips,\nwe really need to report the help that the"},"1904":{"dur":3,"text":"patient needs to complete this lying to sitting\ntransfer."},"1907":{"dur":6,"text":"And if you keep that in your mind and use\nthat as really the driving message to your"},"1913":{"dur":7,"text":"clinicians that you're really trying to just\nquantify how much help does the patient require"},"1921":{"dur":2,"text":"to move from lying to sitting?"},"1923":{"dur":3,"text":"And again, just keep remembering why we're\ndoing this."},"1927":{"dur":7,"text":"Because it is a covariate for the pressure\nulcer, worsening pressure ulcer quality measure."},"1935":{"dur":5,"text":"A patient that's not able to perform this\nactivity, they need assistance."},"1940":{"dur":2,"text":"That is something that is a risk."},"1943":{"dur":4,"text":"It is a risk adjuster for that quality measure."},"1948":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's important that we get it right."},"1951":{"dur":6,"text":"And we're just evaluating how much help they\nreally need to complete the activity."},"1957":{"dur":5,"text":"We do understand, and I mentioned earlier\nas well that clinical judgment is required"},"1963":{"dur":1,"text":"in everything that we do."},"1964":{"dur":5,"text":"I know all of you did a great job on all the\nscoring that Ann Spenard did with the pressure"},"1970":{"dur":1,"text":"ulcers."},"1971":{"dur":4,"text":"A lot of clinical judgment that comes into\nplay with that."},"1976":{"dur":7,"text":"And this applies as well for GG0170C, that\nyou're going to need to use clinical judgment"},"1983":{"dur":6,"text":"to make this determination with the usual\nstatus, with the amount of assistance that"},"1990":{"dur":1,"text":"the patient needs."},"1991":{"dur":5,"text":"And that will help you to make the

GG0170C2."},"2010":{"dur":5,"text":"So the C2 is the second column that you can\nsee highlighted on the screen now."},"2016":{"dur":9,"text":"And so basically for GG0170C2, we're going\nto be scoring what we feel, and what we feel"},"2025":{"dur":6,"text":"after discussing with the patient and other\nconditions that we'll talk about, how would"},"2032":{"dur":4,"text":"the patient's discharge performance look like?"},"2036":{"dur":7,"text":"We'll only be using the 0-06 scores."},"2043":{"dur":5,"text":"So the 6-point scale is really the only scoring\nthat would be appropriate for the

discharge?"},"2077":{"dur":7,"text":"How would we score them on discharge for this\nmeasure?"},"2084":{"dur":7,"text":"So some of the coding instructions for this,\nand again, I'm sure this is not new measures,"},"2092":{"dur":5,"text":"new information for you that the clinicians\nwould really need to be, considering various"},"2097":{"dur":8,"text":"factors when they're trying to code GG0170C2\nfor the Discharge Goal."},"2105":{"dur":5,"text":"You'd need to really consider the patient's\nmedical condition or conditions."},"2111":{"dur":6,"text":"So is that going to impact how well they're\ngoing to progress at discharge in getting"},"2117":{"dur":4,"text":"from this lying position to sitting on the\nside of the bed?"},"2121":{"dur":3,"text":"How about the expected treatments that we\nhave?"},"2125":{"dur":1,"text":"What are our orders?"},"2126":{"dur":2,"text":"What are we providing in home care?"},"2128":{"dur":5,"text":"And do we feel that the treatments that we'll\nbe providing is going to get the patient to"},"2134":{"dur":3,"text":"a better place or possibly not?"},"2138":{"dur":5,"text":"So that's part of how we're going to be considering\nwhat the appropriate Discharge Goal score"},"2143":{"dur":1,"text":"would be."},"2145":{"dur":2,"text":"What is the patient's motivation to improve?"},"2147":{"dur":4,"text":"We talked about the patient that refused to\ndo the activity."},"2151":{"dur":4,"text":"We have all varieties of patients in terms\nof their motivation."},"2156":{"dur":6,"text":"So we need to take into consideration in talking\nwith them and observing what their motivation"},"2162":{"dur":7,"text":"is to improve from where they are today at\nthe SOC\/ROC Performance and where do we feel,"},"2170":{"dur":6,"text":"based on all of these factors, will they be\nat the time of discharge?"},"2176":{"dur":5,"text":"We also are looking at what their prior self-care\nand mobility status is."},"2182":{"dur":5,"text":"Obviously that's a key issue as to how much\nbetter, how much improvement can we expect"},"2188":{"dur":2,"text":"based on what their prior level of function\nwas."},"2191":{"dur":6,"text":"So that will obviously be something that's\ngoing to impact the Discharge Goal."},"2197":{"dur":4,"text":"And then looking at whether there are current\nmultiple diagnoses that could be impacting"},"2201":{"dur":3,"text":"scoring as well."},"2204":{"dur":5,"text":"So again, we can't stress enough that the\nimportance of getting an accurate goal is"},"2210":{"dur":7,"text":"looking at all of those factors, but also\nhaving a very frank discussion with the patient"},"2217":{"dur":6,"text":"and the family, the caregivers, to really\ndetermine what is the appropriate

do you expect that patient to be at\nthe time of discharge for this measure?"},"2240":{"dur":8,"text":"So the use of the dash for the GG0170C2 is\nan appropriate or a valid response."},"2249":{"dur":4,"text":"Again we have to stress that it would be something\nthat would be rarely used."},"2254":{"dur":6,"text":"It's valid if the patient unexpectedly is\ntransferred or discharged so that you're not"},"2260":{"dur":4,"text":"able to complete this assessment at that time."},"2265":{"dur":2,"text":"So you would be able to use the dash."},"2267":{"dur":5,"text":"But again, it would be a rare time that you\nwould use dash as the code for the Discharge"},"2273":{"dur":4,"text":"Goal."},"2278":{"dur":5,"text":"So what would be the scenario that your nurses\nwould determine that the Discharge Goal is"},"2283":{"dur":4,"text":"higher than the SOC\/ROC Performance?"},"2287":{"dur":3,"text":"We'd like to think that all of our patients\nimprove."},"2290":{"dur":4,"text":"Sometimes there are reasons why the score\nwould not be better."},"2295":{"dur":5,"text":"But in the instance where the Discharge Goal\nis higher, it would be that the clinician"},"2301":{"dur":5,"text":"has determined with the patient and the family\nthat the patient should be expected to make"},"2306":{"dur":7,"text":"functional progress by discharge, and that\nthe response reported for the Discharge Goal"},"2314":{"dur":6,"text":"will be higher or more independent than the\nSOC\/ROC Performance response."},"2320":{"dur":6,"text":"So if your

improved"},"2334":{"dur":8,"text":"or higher score on the Discharge Goal versus\nthe start of care performance code."},"2342":{"dur":7,"text":"The Discharge Goal code being the same, there\nare instances that when your nurses, the clinician"},"2349":{"dur":5,"text":"talks with the patient and the family, they\ndetermine that due to the medical complexity"},"2355":{"dur":6,"text":"of the patient, that they are not expected\nto make progress during the home health episode."},"2362":{"dur":5,"text":"That it's expected that they're going to maintain\nthat level of function, but because of the"},"2367":{"dur":5,"text":"medical complexity of their condition, it's\ndetermined that the patient's score at the"},"2373":{"dur":7,"text":"start of care or the resumption of care for\nthis activity is not going to improve, but"},"2381":{"dur":2,"text":"it's not going to get worse either."},"2383":{"dur":9,"text":"So in that instance, the Discharge Goal would\nbe the same as the SOC\/ROC Performance code."},"2393":{"dur":6,"text":"And there are some instances that unfortunately\na patient's Discharge Goal would be lower"},"2399":{"dur":3,"text":"than the SOC\/ROC Performance code."},"2402":{"dur":8,"text":"This would be when the caregiver and the family,\nother members determine that the patient has"},"2411":{"dur":7,"text":"a progressive neurological dysfunction,

skilled\ntherapy services, skilled nursing services"},"2429":{"dur":3,"text":"possibly to slow that decline."},"2432":{"dur":8,"text":"But when you're considering all of the factors\nand trying to score GG0170C2 as a Discharge"},"2441":{"dur":5,"text":"Goal, you would not say that the patient's\ngoing to be improved or stay the same."},"2447":{"dur":4,"text":"Because of that neurological condition, you\nwould determine that the patient is going"},"2451":{"dur":6,"text":"to be at a lower scoring, again moving from\nlying to sitting on the side of the bed."},"2457":{"dur":5,"text":"So in that instance, it would be a lower score\nthan the start of care or resumption of care"},"2463":{"dur":5,"text":"performance."},"2469":{"dur":1,"text":"So we are getting to the fun part
