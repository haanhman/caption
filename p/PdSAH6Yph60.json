questions."},"3530":{"dur":1,"text":"You can pick them in order."},"3532":{"dur":2,"text":"First one is, what's the\ndifference a slit spectrograph"},"3535":{"dur":2,"text":"and a slitless

that?"},"3564":{"dur":3,"text":"- Okay, so let's\nsee, first question."},"3567":{"dur":2,"text":"(laughing)\nUh oh."},"3569":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Attendee] Slit and slitless."},"3571":{"dur":2,"text":"- Slitless and slitted, okay."},"3573":{"dur":4,"text":"So normally we wanna limit\nthe light that enters"},"3577":{"dur":4,"text":"the spectrograph, and so\nwe use a small slit so that"},"3582":{"dur":3,"text":"it isolates the galaxy or\nstar that we're looking at."},"3585":{"dur":2,"text":"What it is does is eliminates\nall the background from"},"3588":{"dur":1,"text":"the rest of the field of view,\nand so it lets us concentrate"},"3590":{"dur":2,"text":"on that one object."},"3592":{"dur":3,"text":"In a slitless spectrograph\nwe still use the prism"},"3595":{"dur":3,"text":"or grating or whatever\nthe spectrograph uses,"},"3598":{"dur":4,"text":"but now we don't isolate it,\nso we get light from every"},"3602":{"dur":3,"text":"point in the sky that\nenters the instrument."},"3605":{"dur":3,"text":"So what happens is with a\nslitted spectrograph you'll have"},"3609":{"dur":4,"text":"one micron light here,\nfive micron light there,"},"3613":{"dur":1,"text":"and you know exactly\nwhere everything is."},"3614":{"dur":4,"text":"With slitless one star's\none micron light be here,"},"3619":{"dur":3,"text":"but another star's one micron\nlight might be over here."},"3622":{"dur":3,"text":"And so you have a mixture\nof things, and so it's not"},"3625":{"dur":2,"text":"as sensitive, but if you\nhave a lot of bright objects,"},"3628":{"dur":4,"text":"it lets you get crude spectra\nof many things all at once."},"3632":{"dur":2,"text":"So there are advantages to both."},"3634":{"dur":4,"text":"Most of the time we use some\nversion of a slit spectrograph."},"3638":{"dur":2,"text":"But occasionally we\ndon't care so much."},"3640":{"dur":1,"text":"We just wanna look at\nsomething really bright,"},"3642":{"dur":2,"text":"and then we'll use the slitless."},"3645":{"dur":3,"text":"Little crazy, but\nit's all good stuff."},"3649":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, you're gonna\nhave to do it again."},"3651":{"dur":2,"text":"- [Attendee] Second question\nwas if there was any plans"},"3653":{"dur":3,"text":"for a non-colocated,\nnon-circular chronograph."},"3658":{"dur":4,"text":"- So there are studies of\nwhether you could fly something"},"3662":{"dur":3,"text":"in front of James Webb at\nsome point in the

right."},"3672":{"dur":3,"text":"They'll probably need a\ndedicated mission to do"},"3675":{"dur":1,"text":"something like that."},"3677":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a neat concept, and\nit will happen someday,"},"3681":{"dur":2,"text":"but I don't thing the Webb\nis quite the right time"},"3683":{"dur":1,"text":"to do that."},"3685":{"dur":2,"text":"And then the third one was?"},"3687":{"dur":1,"text":"- Station keeping."},"3688":{"dur":1,"text":"- Station keeping, yeah."},"3690":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, in that little video\nyou saw some momentum flaps"},"3692":{"dur":4,"text":"on the back, so it's a\nsomewhat standard system."},"3698":{"dur":2,"text":"It uses reaction wheels, it\nuses those momentum flaps"},"3700":{"dur":2,"text":"to help move things around."},"3703":{"dur":2,"text":"When it needs to do a small\ncourse correction to keep it"},"3705":{"dur":2,"text":"in that orbit around L2,\nthen it does use a little bit"},"3708":{"dur":1,"text":"of propellant."},"3710":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's sort of a mixture\nof all of them to make sure"},"3713":{"dur":3,"text":"it's pointing where\nwe want it to point."},"3716":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay?"},"3717":{"dur":1,"text":"- Thank you."},"3720":{"dur":2,"text":"- So I had a very fundamental\nquestion about the early,"},"3723":{"dur":1,"text":"early galaxies."},"3724":{"dur":3,"text":"So how do we actually see them?"},"3727":{"dur":2,"text":"So everything started\nwith the Big Bang and went"},"3729":{"dur":3,"text":"away from it, so how, I\nguess how is that light not"},"3732":{"dur":2,"text":"already, like how do\nwe actually see them?"},"3734":{"dur":1,"text":"How has that light not passed\nus since we don't travel"},"3736":{"dur":1,"text":"faster than light?"},"3738":{"dur":2,"text":"- So yeah, the universe is\nkind of a big time machine."},"3740":{"dur":2,"text":"It takes a certain amount\nof time for light from"},"3743":{"dur":2,"text":"that galaxy to get to us."},"3745":{"dur":4,"text":"So those galaxies that we see\n13.4 billion light years away,"},"3753":{"dur":2,"text":"that light left that long ago."},"3756":{"dur":2,"text":"So we only see the\ngalaxy at that age."},"3759":{"dur":1,"text":"We have no idea what\nit looks like now."},"3761":{"dur":4,"text":"So as the universe is expanding,\nthat light is red shifted,"},"3765":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's why we see\nit in the infrared."},"3768":{"dur":3,"text":"But we really are seeing\nit a long time ago."},"3771":{"dur":3,"text":"So I don't know if I\nanswered that very well,"},"3776":{"dur":3,"text":"but we are seeing the light\nthat travelled a long time"},"3779":{"dur":1,"text":"to get to us."},"3781":{"dur":2,"text":"- Okay, so it lasted long\nenough for us to essentially"},"3783":{"dur":2,"text":"travel all that distance,\nand then kept emitting."},"3785":{"dur":1,"text":"- Right, right, so that\nlight's catching up to us"},"3787":{"dur":2,"text":"as that galaxy's\nreceding away from us."},"3790":{"dur":0,"text":"Okay?"},"3794":{"dur":3,"text":"- My question has two parts,\nbut it's basically about"},"3797":{"dur":1,"text":"the sunshield."},"3800":{"dur":3,"text":"So is it true that this really\nhuge sunshield allows you"},"3807":{"dur":4,"text":"to do the cooling without\nhaving like liquid hydrogen"},"3812":{"dur":3,"text":"or liquid helium or something,\nand so therefore you won't"},"3815":{"dur":2,"text":"run out like you\ndid with Spitzer?"},"3818":{"dur":1,"text":"- Right, that's right."},"3819":{"dur":2,"text":"So the sunshield provides an\nenvironment where the telescope"},"3822":{"dur":3,"text":"and three of the four\ninstruments can cool to 40"},"3825":{"dur":2,"text":"to 50 kelvin on their own."},"3827":{"dur":2,"text":"There are some other radiators\nthat are kind of tucked"},"3829":{"dur":2,"text":"around the back to\nhelp with that process,"},"3831":{"dur":3,"text":"but yeah, that sunshield\nhas to work exactly the way"},"3835":{"dur":1,"text":"it's supposed to in order to--"},"3837":{"dur":1,"text":"- So that's a more\nambitious sunshield than you"},"3838":{"dur":1,"text":"ever had before."},"3840":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Michael] Yes, absolutely."},"3841":{"dur":4,"text":"- So then the next question,\npart of it is how much of"},"3845":{"dur":2,"text":"a constraint is the\nsunshield as far as where you"},"3847":{"dur":1,"text":"point the telescope?"},"3850":{"dur":2,"text":"Obviously you can't\npoint it towards the sun."},"3853":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Michael] Right."},"3855":{"dur":4,"text":"- So
