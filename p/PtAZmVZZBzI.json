-- because this is a"},"545":{"dur":4,"text":"-- obviously an issue that isn't just in the\npast, it's here now and people are arguing"},"550":{"dur":5,"text":"about it, why is it important to say

contradictory\nevidence."},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"Annette Gordon-Reed:\nAnd specifically about the Republicans, let"},"673":{"dur":5,"text":"me come back to that, what -- at what point\ndo they begin to develop a plan about this;"},"678":{"dur":4,"text":"you get some sense that there's consensus,\nthat they really are going to go after slavery?"},"683":{"dur":4,"text":"James Oakes:\nYeah, I -- it's pretty clear to me -- well,"},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"I backed into this."},"689":{"dur":4,"text":"I started the usual place that most historians\nstart this story of the emancipation, with"},"693":{"dur":3,"text":"Fortress Monroe, and then I went on to the\nFirst Confiscation Act, and I was trying to"},"697":{"dur":4,"text":"figure out most of the story to write about\nthe First

about?\""},"705":{"dur":3,"text":"And I discovered that they were all talking\nabout emancipation; it was understood to be"},"709":{"dur":4,"text":"an emancipation law, and I -- and I saw there\nwas a full-scale debate on emancipation."},"714":{"dur":4,"text":"This is the summer of 1861, the first summer\nof the war, Congress is called into a special"},"718":{"dur":4,"text":"session five months

days"},"728":{"dur":3,"text":"later the War Department issues the instructions\nto begin emancipating."},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"So -- well, they couldn't have thought this\nup right

going to start emancipating slaves.\""},"743":{"dur":1,"text":"And then I said, \"Where did that come from?\""},"745":{"dur":3,"text":"And I just came backing up and I ended up\nall the way in the 18th century, where these"},"749":{"dur":1,"text":"ideas come from."},"750":{"dur":1,"text":"[laughter]"},"751":{"dur":3,"text":"Edward Ayers:\nIt really is a grand old party."},"754":{"dur":3,"text":"James Oakes:\nBut it's -- one of the things -- I understand,"},"758":{"dur":4,"text":"actually -- I understand the resistance about\nLincoln, because I do think people have a"},"763":{"dur":4,"text":"hard time coming to any reasonable arguments\nabout Lincoln."},"768":{"dur":4,"text":"You -- the tendency to turning him into a\ngreat emancipator has the countertendency"},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"of turning him into this, you know, racist\nreluctant emancipator."},"776":{"dur":5,"text":"And it's very hard to find a middle ground\nwithin which he -- within which to place him"},"781":{"dur":1,"text":"historically."},"782":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think -- one of the things I try to\ndo in the book is just say, look, he's a Republican,"},"786":{"dur":4,"text":"and the Republicans have these ideas about\nwhat they can and can't do; they implement"},"790":{"dur":5,"text":"them very quickly, quicker than I expected\nthem to begin emancipating -- implementing"},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"them."},"797":{"dur":5,"text":"And they learned over the course of the next\nseveral years that this wasn't enough, they're"},"802":{"dur":3,"text":"going to have to go further, it's not working\nin the border states, we're going to have"},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"to shift our, you know, policy there."},"808":{"dur":6,"text":"And ultimately they end up where, you know,\nthey realize, by late 1863, early 1864, that"},"815":{"dur":5,"text":"none of these policies are actually enough,\nand they shift to a completely different policy"},"820":{"dur":6,"text":"that no one actually imagined before the Civil\nWar, which is the 13th amendment to the Constitution."},"826":{"dur":5,"text":"So it's about the evolution of a policy by\na party, not Lincoln as a great emancipator."},"831":{"dur":2,"text":"Annette Gordon-Reed:\nNot an evolution of Lincoln?"},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"James Oakes:\nWell, he's part of the evolution."},"836":{"dur":4,"text":"The whole party is changing; that is, they're\nresponding to the limits of their own policies"},"841":{"dur":1,"text":"as they're implementing them."},"842":{"dur":4,"text":"Annette Gordon-Reed:\nSo you start off with a -- at a conventional"},"846":{"dur":5,"text":"place, and then you feel you have to keep\ngoing back to the stories and pushing it back."},"852":{"dur":3,"text":"Do you have any idea why other people didn't\npush back?"},"855":{"dur":1,"text":"James Oakes:\nThat far, you mean?"},"857":{"dur":5,"text":"Annette Gordon-Reed:\nYeah, I mean, why is it just -- why are you"},"862":{"dur":1,"text":"coming to the point that --"},"863":{"dur":1,"text":"James Oakes:\nOh, well, I
