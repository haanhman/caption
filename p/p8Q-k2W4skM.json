other doctors start seeing\npatients with memory issues?"},"99":{"dur":2,"text":"Is there a typical age of onset?\n>>Dr. Ranchero:"},"102":{"dur":3,"text":"Sure.\nGenerally, we start seeing patients with dementia,"},"105":{"dur":4,"text":"or signs and symptoms of dementia, early stages,\nafter the age of 60."},"109":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, that said, have I seen patients with\nearly onset Alzheimer's or early onset dementia"},"114":{"dur":5,"text":"at age 30, 40, and 50?\nYes, and generally, those are patients that"},"120":{"dur":6,"text":"have some genetic disposition or genetic condition\nthat they suffer from that predisposes them"},"126":{"dur":3,"text":"to a dementia or memory, memory or cognitive\nproblem."},"130":{"dur":0,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nOkay."},"131":{"dur":4,"text":"So, you mentioned dementia and Alzheimer's.\nAre they the same thing, or two totally different"},"135":{"dur":3,"text":"Great question.\nAlzheimer's is a part of dementia."},"139":{"dur":4,"text":"Dementia just means that a person has a problem\nwith their memory, with their cognitive abilities."},"143":{"dur":3,"text":"And Alzheimer's is the most common form of\ndementia."},"147":{"dur":4,"text":"So, in dementia, is there something, what's\nhappening in your brain?"},"152":{"dur":3,"text":"Explain kind of the science of dementia.\n>>Dr. Ranchero:"},"155":{"dur":4,"text":"Sure.\nDementia can be caused by numerous things."},"159":{"dur":3,"text":"As I said, first is Alzheimer's disease is\nthe most common."},"162":{"dur":4,"text":"You can have people who suffer from dementia,\nagain, its just cognitive decline, decline"},"166":{"dur":2,"text":"in memory.\nThat can be due to drugs, alcohol, medical"},"169":{"dur":4,"text":"conditions.\nPatients that even suffer from depression,"},"174":{"dur":5,"text":"patients who had brain injuries, patients\nwho have problems with poor profusion or oxygenation"},"179":{"dur":3,"text":"to the brain.\nVascular dementia, that's the second most"},"183":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay.\nBut Alzheimer's actually, there is something"},"186":{"dur":1,"text":"different happening in the brain.\n>>Dr. Ranchero:"},"188":{"dur":1,"text":"Correct.\nWe do know pathologically what's going on"},"190":{"dur":6,"text":"with Alzheimer's disease, is that we get neurofibrillary\ntangles and amyloid plaques."},"196":{"dur":3,"text":"And why these happen, we necessarily don't\nknow."},"199":{"dur":6,"text":"But the most definitive way to diagnose someone\nwith Alzheimer's is by doing an autopsy and"},"206":{"dur":4,"text":"looking at the brain, and seeing these plaques\nand these tangles, and actually parts of the"},"211":{"dur":2,"text":"brain that have shrunk.\n>>Lori Casey:"},"213":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay.\nSo, is that, is Alzheimer's a fairly new disease,"},"218":{"dur":5,"text":"or do we think people always had it, and it's\njust now that we have kind of put a name to"},"223":{"dur":1,"text":"it?\n>>Dr. Ranchero:"},"224":{"dur":3,"text":"Alzheimer's was first, I guess, named in 1906\nby Dr. Alzheimer."},"228":{"dur":5,"text":"He had a patient that he noticed had this\ncognitive decline, had memory problems, speech"},"234":{"dur":3,"text":"problems, and eventually couldn't perform\nmany of her activities of daily living."},"238":{"dur":3,"text":"Couldn't function.\nAnd then, he performed an autopsy on the brain,"},"241":{"dur":4,"text":"and found these unusual hallmarks on the brain,\nthese plaques and tangles."},"246":{"dur":6,"text":"And ever since then, they've found that as\nwe age, we're at higher risk for developing"},"252":{"dur":3,"text":"Alzheimer's disease and this dementia.\n>>Lori Casey:"},"255":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay.\nSo, how do you know..."},"256":{"dur":5,"text":"I mean, I get forgetful and scattered some\ndays, and can't, you know, I've lost my keys,"},"262":{"dur":4,"text":"I can't remember where I left my purse.\nWe've all had that before."},"266":{"dur":6,"text":"How do we know when it's something more than\njust I, you know, don't have my act together"},"272":{"dur":1,"text":"today?\nAnd it could be something more."},"274":{"dur":2,"text":">>Dr. Ranchero:\nI think a lot of it is going to your doctor"},"277":{"dur":4,"text":"or, if you're concerned, if you have a family\nmember that you're concerned is suffering"},"281":{"dur":3,"text":"from dementia or Alzheimer's.\nGoing to the doctor and making sure there's"},"285":{"dur":3,"text":"not other causes.\nAgain, are they depressed?"},"288":{"dur":3,"text":"Do they have a problem with their electrolytes?\nDo they have a problem with profusion and"},"292":{"dur":3,"text":"getting oxygen to their brain?\nAre there other things that are going on?"},"295":{"dur":6,"text":"So, getting lab tests, getting diagnostic\nexams of the brain, having neurological tests"},"301":{"dur":5,"text":"done.\nAsking questions about their brain and asking"},"307":{"dur":3,"text":"questions of, can they do math, can they do\nword questions."},"310":{"dur":6,"text":"Your doctor can do tests to determine, are\nthere signs of some sort of cognitive function"},"317":{"dur":5,"text":"going on there.\nBut sometimes it's really the families saying"},"322":{"dur":5,"text":"something's gone on with this loved one.\nThe way they're handling money, the way they're"},"327":{"dur":7,"text":"driving.\nThe beginning stages of dementia and Alzheimer's"},"335":{"dur":5,"text":"is a stage we call mild cognitive impairment.\nThe inability to learn."},"340":{"dur":2,"text":"They're asking the same questions over and\nover again."},"343":{"dur":6,"text":"A spouse can't be corrected, or the other\nspouse is saying they just don't get it, and"},"350":{"dur":2,"text":"they're not learning.\nSo, it's simple things like that that you"},"353":{"dur":3,"text":"start to notice that, wait a second, there's\nbeen some change in personality, some change"},"357":{"dur":3,"text":"in behavior, some change in the way this person\noperates."},"360":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nOkay."},"361":{"dur":4,"text":"So, are there outside things, though, like\nstroke, you had mentioned depression, or even"},"366":{"dur":3,"text":"trauma that can trigger that or bring on dementia?\n>>Dr. Ranchero:"},"370":{"dur":2,"text":"And those are things that we need to look\nout for."},"373":{"dur":7,"text":"Because, we do know patients that suffer from\nAlzheimer's and dementia, they get worse when"},"380":{"dur":4,"text":"they're in a new environment, they get worse\nwhen things change, they get worse when they"},"384":{"dur":3,"text":"get stressed out.\nSometimes the worst thing you can do for an"},"387":{"dur":3,"text":"Alzheimer's patient is continually change\ntheir environment."},"391":{"dur":5,"text":"I knew a family, it was a large family, and\nthey continually shipped Grandma from house"},"397":{"dur":4,"text":"to house to house.\nAnd her behavior got worse, worse, and worse."},"401":{"dur":3,"text":"Because one of the best things you can do\nto help support an Alzheimer's patient is"},"405":{"dur":3,"text":"give them a structured environment.\nGive them an environment that they know what's"},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"going to happen, that there's going to be\nroutine, that it doesn't change."},"412":{"dur":2,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nSo, how do you, when you have a patient come"},"414":{"dur":5,"text":"in that is diagnosed with, you know, those\nearly stages, that's a tough thing to take"},"420":{"dur":3,"text":"in and realize this is what I'm going to live\nwith."},"423":{"dur":6,"text":"How do you help that person accept that, and\nthen sort of move forward from that diagnosis?"},"429":{"dur":3,"text":">>Dr. Ranchero:\nSometimes it's just letting the person know"},"433":{"dur":6,"text":"that I want to help them, help them to realize\nthat things have changed, that maybe their"},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"thinking has gone down, that their memory\nhas changed."},"441":{"dur":4,"text":"And it could be letting them know that through\ntests that, okay, things have changed, that"},"446":{"dur":4,"text":"in the future, that we might need to make\nsome changes, and that what are their wishes"},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"and what are their wants.\nAnd that we don't want to do anything that"},"454":{"dur":3,"text":"would make them scared or fearful.\nAnd let them know that we're going to give"},"457":{"dur":3,"text":"them as much control as we can give them.\nBut that they're cared for, and they're going"},"461":{"dur":1,"text":"to be cared for.\n>>Lori Casey:"},"462":{"dur":5,"text":"Is there, does it progress faster in some\npeople, slower in others?"},"467":{"dur":4,"text":"Is there anything that says, that gives you\nany indication that it will progress quickly?"},"472":{"dur":3,"text":">>Dr. Ranchero:\nI think a lot of it also has to do with the"},"475":{"dur":5,"text":"type of dementia that you do have.\nVascular dementia and other types of dementia"},"481":{"dur":7,"text":"can get worse significantly fast vs. Alzheimer's,\nwhich is usually a slow progression."},"489":{"dur":6,"text":"Maybe over months and years, they're unable\nto dress themselves, feed themselves, bathe"},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"themselves.\nBut that's over months to years."},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"Not all of a sudden, one week they can do\nsomething, and then next week they can't."},"500":{"dur":2,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nSo, why is the vascular a lot faster that"},"503":{"dur":0,"text":"Alzheimer's?\n>>Dr. Ranchero:"},"504":{"dur":4,"text":"Parts of the brain are dying because of strokes\nor poor oxygenation."},"508":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, we actually, with Alzheimer's we see\nparts of the brain do shrink and atrophy,"},"513":{"dur":6,"text":"but it's at a more steady decline vs. a rapid,\nweek to week, month to month, or even day"},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"to day.\n>>Lori Casey:"},"521":{"dur":4,"text":"So, do you find that the dementia\/Alzheimer's,\nis it hereditary?"},"525":{"dur":2,"text":">>Dr. Ranchero:\nThere is a genetic component, definitely."},"528":{"dur":3,"text":"But there's also environmental factors, and\nthere's also dietary factors."},"532":{"dur":4,"text":"There's also things we can do.\nYes, we can't change our genetics."},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"Can we somewhat modify our environment?\nYes."},"540":{"dur":5,"text":"But there's other things we can do to help\nprevent dementia, also Alzheimer's disease,"},"546":{"dur":4,"text":"but also prevent the decline into worsening\nAlzheimer's disease."},"550":{"dur":2,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nLet's talk about some of those preventative"},"553":{"dur":4,"text":"things that we can do to hopefully stave off\nthings like this."},"558":{"dur":3,"text":">>Dr. Ranchero:\nFrom a young age, number one is use safety"},"561":{"dur":4,"text":"equipment.\nWe do know that someone that is more likely,"},"566":{"dur":4,"text":"the more head injuries, the more concussions,\nthe more injuries to the brain that a person"},"570":{"dur":4,"text":"suffers from, they will develop Parkinson's\ndisease, dementia, Alzheimer's disease."},"575":{"dur":5,"text":"I mean, we could look at football players,\nboxers, professional athletes. People who"},"580":{"dur":5,"text":"have head injuries are more likely to develop\nAlzheimer's disease and dementia."},"585":{"dur":4,"text":"Staying active.\nOne thing, a study that came out decades ago"},"590":{"dur":5,"text":"showed, it was a study on nuns.\nAnd they looked at, the nuns were willing"},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"to donate their brains to science later one.\nAnd they said, and they were trying to look"},"599":{"dur":5,"text":"at, can we predict those people who have Alzheimer's?\nAnd what was found when they did the autopsies"},"604":{"dur":5,"text":"at the end, when the nuns passed away, is\nthe nuns, that even though their brains looked"},"610":{"dur":4,"text":"like they had Alzheimer's and dementia, they\ndidn't have any symptoms."},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"Why?\nThey stayed active."},"616":{"dur":2,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nActive physically, mentally, or both?"},"618":{"dur":1,"text":">>Dr. Ranchero:\nBoth."},"620":{"dur":5,"text":"And really, what we're seeing is staying physically\nactive is very important."},"625":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think part of that also has to do with\ngetting oxygen to the brain."},"628":{"dur":4,"text":"Getting the right amount of nutrients.\nBut also staying mentally active, staying"},"633":{"dur":5,"text":"social, challenging your mind, doing something\nyou enjoy, and not just being sedentary and"},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"laying back.\n>>Lori Casey:"},"640":{"dur":2,"text":"Mmhmm.\nSo, we see, you know, there's all these programs"},"642":{"dur":3,"text":"out there for brain training.\nDoes that work?"},"646":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean, is that, you know, is that going to\nmake it so I don't have dementia later on"},"651":{"dur":1,"text":"in life?\n>>Dr. Ranchero:"},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"I think the studies are not proof, showing\nthat."},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't know if there's positive proof of\nthat."},"658":{"dur":4,"text":"However, what I'd say is that that can definitely\nhelp keep you sharp."},"662":{"dur":3,"text":"Because, if you do have the genetic disposition,\nand you've had the environmental factors,"},"666":{"dur":3,"text":"maybe the brain injuries, maybe nothing will\nhelp prevent it."},"669":{"dur":4,"text":"However, knowing that, I think keeping active\nand keeping your mind active definitely would"},"674":{"dur":3,"text":"Because what does that, when you do stuff\nlike those brain training exercises, or even"},"678":{"dur":3,"text":"crossword puzzles and reading, what does that\ndo to your brain?"},"681":{"dur":1,"text":">>Dr. Ranchero:\nIt's making connections, it's keeping those"},"683":{"dur":4,"text":"connections, those neurons.\nYour brain is made of brain cells, nerve cells,"},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"neurons.\nSo, by doing those things, by challenging"},"690":{"dur":4,"text":"your mind, you're reactivating those connections,\nyou're firing those connections."},"694":{"dur":3,"text":"And you're keeping those connections alive.\n>>Lori Casey:"},"697":{"dur":4,"text":"Because when you have, like, Alzheimer's,\ndo those connections just quit?"},"702":{"dur":2,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nQuits making new ones?"},"704":{"dur":1,"text":">>Dr. Ranchero:\nThat is correct."},"706":{"dur":4,"text":"Oftentimes, what you'll see with Alzheimer's\npatients is parts of their brain actually"},"710":{"dur":4,"text":"shrink, parts of those neurons die.\nAnd we see that."},"715":{"dur":7,"text":"I've seen CT scans and MRIs, magnetic resonance\nimaging of patients' brains."},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"And when you see an Alzheimer's patient or\na patient that suffers from dementia, their"},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"brain is actually smaller.\n>>Lori Casey:"},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"Wow.\nSo, ways to prevent are, you know, keep active"},"731":{"dur":5,"text":"physically and mentally.\nWhat about diet and, you know, how much we"},"737":{"dur":3,"text":"weigh?\nWeight seems to play a big role in all sorts"},"740":{"dur":1,"text":"of medical conditions.\n>>Dr. Ranchero:"},"742":{"dur":5,"text":"We do know now that obesity, when people carry\na lot of adipose tissue or fat, it's not just"},"748":{"dur":1,"text":"fat.\nIt's an endocrine organ."},"749":{"dur":4,"text":"It's producing oxidants, it's producing free\nradicals."},"753":{"dur":7,"text":"Free radicals damage your cells.\nBrain cells, neurons cannot regenerate themselves."},"761":{"dur":7,"text":"So, if we can stay a healthy weight, that\nwill also help us maintain good blood sugars,"},"770":{"dur":5,"text":"prevent hypertension, prevent high cholesterol.\nAnd all those things, by staying healthy,"},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"will help our brains to stay even healthier.\nNow, can we eat well?"},"779":{"dur":4,"text":"Eating our five servings of fruits and vegetables\na day."},"783":{"dur":3,"text":"Keeping our brain active.\nMaking sure we're getting a lot of antioxidants,"},"787":{"dur":3,"text":"which are in the fruits and vegetables.\nOr taking supplements."},"790":{"dur":4,"text":"We do know people with higher levels of Vitamin\nD, for instance, not only do they live longer,"},"795":{"dur":3,"text":"but they have a lower incidence of developing\nAlzheimer's and dementia."},"799":{"dur":2,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nWhat about other types of supplements?"},"802":{"dur":3,"text":"In the materials you gave me, isn't one Ginkgo\nbiloba?"},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"Natural supplements, are there things that\nwe can take?"},"808":{"dur":1,"text":">>Dr. Ranchero:\nYou know what?"},"809":{"dur":4,"text":"I think when it comes to the natural supplements,\nthe studies go back and forth."},"814":{"dur":3,"text":"But the most, one of the most important things\nI tell my patients, especially when it comes"},"817":{"dur":5,"text":"to supplements, if it helps you and does no\nharm, then I don't have a problem with it."},"823":{"dur":6,"text":"The reason I say that, the reason that the\nFDA and the pharmaceutical community does"},"829":{"dur":5,"text":"placebo controlled studies is because 30 to\n40% of the time, you?re going to get better"},"834":{"dur":3,"text":"and you will respond because you think you're\ngoing to get better."},"838":{"dur":4,"text":"I remember when my niece and nephew were younger,\nand they'd say, oh I have a headache, or I've"},"843":{"dur":3,"text":"got this, I've got that.\nI would give them a Tic-Tac, and they would"},"846":{"dur":2,"text":"get better.\nLater on, as they got older, they'd say..."},"849":{"dur":2,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nThis tastes a little bit like a Tic-Tac, Uncle"},"851":{"dur":0,"text":"Bernie!\n>>Dr. Ranchero:"},"852":{"dur":3,"text":"Yeah, Uncle Bernie's giving us a Tic-Tac!\nAnd I say, well, but it worked because they"},"855":{"dur":6,"text":"thought it would get better.\nAnd sometimes supplementation and herbs, and"},"861":{"dur":6,"text":"other things like that, more alternative complementary\nmedicine, sometimes it's a matter of the mind"},"867":{"dur":1,"text":"over the body.\nAnd that's why it's powerful."},"869":{"dur":0,"text":"And that's why it works.\n>>Lori Casey:"},"870":{"dur":3,"text":"But any supplements you take, you probably\nneed to run those by your doctor to make sure"},"874":{"dur":2,"text":"that they don't--\n>>Dr. Ranchero:"},"876":{"dur":2,"text":"Do not cause harm.\nThat's the most important thing."},"878":{"dur":1,"text":"Do no harm.\n>>Lori Casey:"},"880":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay.\nSo, let's talk about is the, we'll speak specifically"},"884":{"dur":5,"text":"to Alzheimer's, as it progresses and gets\nworse, what kind of starts to happen to that"},"890":{"dur":5,"text":"patient?\nThey probably see an increase in other types"},"895":{"dur":1,"text":"of medical problems.\n>>Dr. Ranchero:"},"897":{"dur":2,"text":"Yes.\nAnd once you start to develop, going from"},"900":{"dur":6,"text":"the, there's three stages of Alzheimer's:\nmild Alzheimer's, moderate, and then severe."},"907":{"dur":3,"text":"And again, you might see in the mild cases\nthat they're able to function."},"910":{"dur":4,"text":"They can live independently.\nMaybe they need cues, maybe they need just"},"915":{"dur":4,"text":"a minor amount of assistance.\nBut as the disease progresses, they will need"},"919":{"dur":5,"text":"more and more care, more and more support.\nAnd unfortunately, oftentimes that patient"},"925":{"dur":6,"text":"is not aware that they're not, their hygiene\nis not good, that they're not eating correctly,"},"932":{"dur":4,"text":"that they're not dressing correctly, that\nmaybe, unfortunately, they're doing things"},"936":{"dur":4,"text":"that are unsafe.\nAnd we oftentimes see that, unfortunately,"},"940":{"dur":3,"text":"when someone's driving.\nMaybe they're getting into more accidents."},"944":{"dur":3,"text":"Driving can be a very, very complex and complicated\ntask."},"947":{"dur":4,"text":"They're not, and they're doing things because\nthey can't process all the stimuli that's"},"952":{"dur":2,"text":"coming at them, and what they need to do.\n>>Lori Casey:"},"954":{"dur":2,"text":"Right.\nSo, what kinds of care are available?"},"957":{"dur":3,"text":">>Dr. Ranchero:\nWell, I think it really depends on that person"},"960":{"dur":4,"text":"and their family structure, and the support\nsystem they do have."},"965":{"dur":3,"text":"It's nice, obviously, if a person can remain\nin their house, and maybe they have a caregiver."},"968":{"dur":3,"text":"Whether it's a relative or someone they hire\nout, I think that's a great option."},"972":{"dur":5,"text":"But sometimes that doesn't become an option,\nand the best thing to do is get more formal"},"978":{"dur":4,"text":"support for that patient, which can include,\nfirst of all, going to a place that has independent"},"982":{"dur":2,"text":"living.\nWhere they cook for you, where thy clean for"},"985":{"dur":3,"text":"you, where they make sure you're getting the\nthings you need to get done."},"989":{"dur":5,"text":"Where you don't have to worry about those\nthings that are important, but you can have"},"995":{"dur":3,"text":"someone else doing for you.\nAnd then, maybe as the disease progresses,"},"999":{"dur":4,"text":"you go to an assisted living or supportive\nliving, where someone is actually helping"},"1003":{"dur":3,"text":"you with your medications.\nMaybe they're helping you to get dressed,"},"1006":{"dur":4,"text":"maybe they're helping you to eat, maybe they're\nhelping you reminding you the medications"},"1010":{"dur":2,"text":"to take.\nAnd then eventually, as the disease progresses,"},"1013":{"dur":5,"text":"they need to go to a memory care unit, where\nthey're basically assisting you with everything,"},"1018":{"dur":5,"text":"with all your activities of daily living.\nAnd eventually, in the severe stages of Alzheimer's"},"1023":{"dur":4,"text":"disease, you'll need to be placed in
