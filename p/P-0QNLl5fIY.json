to say that it might sound like\nit's something obvious but because a diet"},"76":{"dur":3,"text":"doesn't it just last for six months it last\nfor years and years because the effect

can\nbuild it up into larger accomplishments later."},"113":{"dur":4,"text":"Some of the small things are there's a study\nthat shows that just managing your posture,"},"118":{"dur":4,"text":"keeping your back straight for two weeks,\njust stopping the swearing for two weeks,"},"123":{"dur":4,"text":"those people are able to manage more stressful\ntasks later, they're able to do more tasks"},"128":{"dur":3,"text":"that involve physical discomfort after that\ntwo week period."},"131":{"dur":4,"text":"So in a way they kind of start exercising\nself-control in one dimension but it's leading"},"135":{"dur":2,"text":"into this other realm as well."},"137":{"dur":5,"text":"And then there's another study were they pay\npeople to use a gym eight times in one month"},"143":{"dur":3,"text":"and they pay another group to use it once\na month and then they don't pay anyone at"},"147":{"dur":1,"text":"all the next month."},"148":{"dur":2,"text":"And the people who have been using the gym\nfor eight times, they were paid to go eight"},"151":{"dur":4,"text":"times they just start just using the gym without\ngetting paid and so they've built up this"},"156":{"dur":1,"text":"habit."},"157":{"dur":3,"text":"And so you can start small, start with small\nthings, make them a habit and then build up"},"160":{"dur":1,"text":"to bigger things."},"161":{"dur":3,"text":"There's also something called temptation bundling."},"165":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we compare a want activity with a should\nactivity."},"168":{"dur":3,"text":"No one really wants to do a should activity\nall the time."},"171":{"dur":5,"text":"But another study they had people listen to\na really juicy audio novel and some people"},"177":{"dur":3,"text":"could only listen at the gym while they work\nout, other people they say take it you can"},"180":{"dur":2,"text":"take it home listen whenever you want."},"183":{"dur":4,"text":"And the people where the novel is tied to\nthe gym they go to the gym much more frequently"},"187":{"dur":3,"text":"than the people who get to listen to this\nnovel all the time."},"190":{"dur":4,"text":"And in fact after the experiment is over that\ngroup of people actually wants to pay to stay"},"195":{"dur":4,"text":"on the experiment because it's so successful\nthat it forces them to go to the gym all the"},"199":{"dur":1,"text":"time."},"200":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we compare like a should activity with\na want activity to get us to do those things"},"204":{"dur":2,"text":"and hopefully those things then become habits\nover time."},"207":{"dur":4,"text":"But it is a muscle and even willpower you\nhave to give it a little bit of a break."},"212":{"dur":5,"text":"And so when people do a should activity all\nthe time they get fatigued and they show healthcare"},"217":{"dur":2,"text":"workers they're supposed to wash their hands\nall day."},"220":{"dur":3,"text":"And they start doing it less at the end of\nthe day."},"223":{"dur":3,"text":"And so when they give them longer breaks in\nbetween their shift they find that they'll"},"227":{"dur":3,"text":"continue to do it, they'll wash their hands\nthrough to the end of the day."},"230":{"dur":4,"text":"And so it's important to take the breaks,\nengineer in a break into this long-term regiment"},"235":{"dur":1,"text":"that you have."},"236":{"dur":3,"text":"Another good experiment that really illustrates\nthat is there's one where they have people"},"240":{"dur":4,"text":"hold hand exercising equipment, they have\nthem do this hand exercise."},"244":{"dur":3,"text":"And after a while they separate to the group\ninto two and let one group watch a really"},"248":{"dur":3,"text":"happy movie and one has to watch a sad movie."},"251":{"dur":4,"text":"And when they come back in the room and they're\nsupposed to continue this exercise the group"},"255":{"dur":3,"text":"that watched a happy movie they're ready to\ngo, they're at it, they're able to do it."},"259":{"dur":4,"text":"The group that watched a sad movie there depleted,\nthey just don't feel like doing this exercise"},"263":{"dur":1,"text":"any more."},"265":{"dur":3,"text":"So whatever is that really you motivate you,\nthat excites you, that gives you a little"},"268":{"dur":5,"text":"bit of a lift or a relieve, engineer that\ninto your day if you can somehow, into your"},"274":{"dur":1,"text":"week."},"275":{"dur":3,"text":"Make sure that you're relaxing every once\nin a while rewarding yourself in some way"},"278":{"dur":2,"text":"that this doesn't become a slog."},"281":{"dur":6,"text":"And the reason I do talk about willpower is\non the horizon right now there are some things"},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"you can do to manage weight."},"289":{"dur":5,"text":"We have gastric bypass surgery, we have hormone\nreplacement therapy if you really want that,"},"294":{"dur":3,"text":"there are diet pills you can get and then\nthere's diet and exercise."},"298":{"dur":4,"text":"And if you really need a medical intervention\neveryone of them has a risk benefit profile"},"303":{"dur":1,"text":"and you really need to discuss that with your\ndoctor."},"304":{"dur":4,"text":"If you've gotten that level where it's really\nmedically necessary for you to have one of"},"308":{"dur":2,"text":"those interventions that's a different discussion."},"311":{"dur":4,"text":"But for the here and now it's diet and exercise\nI'm sorry to say."},"315":{"dur":3,"text":"And there are things on the horizon, there's\npossibly lepton injections for people who've"},"318":{"dur":3,"text":"lost weight, there's possibly injecting brown\nfat, which we can get into that too."},"322":{"dur":4,"text":"There are things out there but for now we're\nstuck with what we have, the technologies"},"326":{"dur":2,"text":"we have and the abilities that we have."},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"And so diet and exercise is still important."},"331":{"dur":1,"text":"You have to be very smart about it."},"332":{"dur":3,"text":"You have to understand your hormones, your\nother things that are making you fat."},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"And then you have to be able to stay on whatever\nthat regiment is that you pick."},"338":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's why willpower comes in."},"340":{"dur":3,"text":"But the book is full of many more things than\njust willpower and diet and exercise."}}
