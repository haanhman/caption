protectionism"},"3567":{"dur":2,"text":"that Americans are buying to some degree"},"3570":{"dur":2,"text":"because they're frightened and they're anxious,"},"3572":{"dur":3,"text":"and they're angry,

me."},"3580":{"dur":4,"text":"He's unacceptable as a human being, but what he is saying"},"3585":{"dur":3,"text":"frightens me even more about those issues."},"3588":{"dur":2,"text":"- Mike Murphy who ran Jeb Bush's campaign,"},"3591":{"dur":2,"text":"has run other Republican campaigns in the past,"},"3593":{"dur":2,"text":"said that he blames this election on Fred

I just want to ask about whether,"},"3621":{"dur":3,"text":"you mentioned how these populist movements"},"3624":{"dur":2,"text":"often manage to build bridges between"},"3626":{"dur":1,"text":"deep ideological divisions."},"3628":{"dur":2,"text":"Like I heard Catholics and Atheists united together"},"3631":{"dur":2,"text":"at one point, and so, and you also talked about"},"3634":{"dur":2,"text":"the need for a President Hillary Clinton"},"3636":{"dur":2,"text":"to unite the center and the left, and is there anything"},"3639":{"dur":4,"text":"you think she can

it."},"3654":{"dur":4,"text":"I think she needs to lead, and that's easy to say,"},"3658":{"dur":1,"text":"and everyone says people need to lead,"},"3660":{"dur":2,"text":"but let me just explain that."},"3662":{"dur":2,"text":"She can't run away from the issues."},"3664":{"dur":2,"text":"She's got to address them directly."},"3667":{"dur":2,"text":"The American people have seen their society,"},"3669":{"dur":3,"text":"excuse me for talking just about the U.S. right now."},"3673":{"dur":3,"text":"Have seen a society change, and sociologically,"},"3677":{"dur":2,"text":"tremendous changes in our society."},"3680":{"dur":2,"text":"10 years ago, if I'd told you,"},"3682":{"dur":1,"text":"not you, probably, you're young enough"},"3684":{"dur":1,"text":"you would have believed it."},"3685":{"dur":1,"text":"That gay marriage would be accepted"},"3687":{"dur":1,"text":"all across the United States of America,"},"3689":{"dur":2,"text":"you would have thought I was out of my mind,"},"3691":{"dur":1,"text":"just 10 years ago!"},"3693":{"dur":3,"text":"Look at that sociological change, look at the LGBT community"},"3697":{"dur":4,"text":"and how people are accepted as they should be now,"},"3701":{"dur":3,"text":"not so just 10 years ago, 15 years ago."},"3704":{"dur":2,"text":"Look what's happened to us just in the last few years"},"3707":{"dur":3,"text":"in terms of race and color and immigration"},"3710":{"dur":1,"text":"and absorbing people."},"3712":{"dur":2,"text":"We have done a pretty good job here."},"3715":{"dur":3,"text":"Let me give everyone credit for this in this country,"},"3718":{"dur":2,"text":"but the change is frightening to people."},"3721":{"dur":2,"text":"They look around and say, these people don't look like

United States of America."},"3744":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a great thing, it's our strength."},"3746":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a way we've grown over the years,"},"3748":{"dur":2,"text":"but we've always had this reaction."},"3751":{"dur":3,"text":"Before we all panic too much, it's happened before."},"3755":{"dur":2,"text":"We've had riots and bombings and killings"},"3758":{"dur":2,"text":"and right

century?"},"3765":{"dur":2,"text":"And the reaction to what was going on in this country"},"3768":{"dur":3,"text":"and labor being dissatisfied, and the immigrants"},"3771":{"dur":2,"text":"pouring into the United States?"},"3773":{"dur":2,"text":"That's when my grandparents came here,"},"3776":{"dur":2,"text":"during that period of time."},"3778":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's not panic, we've been through it before."},"3781":{"dur":1,"text":"Other countries have been through it,"},"3782":{"dur":2,"text":"but it does exist, so let me go back to Hillary."},"3785":{"dur":4,"text":"She's gonna have to talk to the country directly about it."},"3789":{"dur":3,"text":"You can't avoid it, you can't run away from it."},"3793":{"dur":1,"text":"She's gonna have to say, let's just say"},"3794":{"dur":2,"text":"what we're talking about, trade today."},"3796":{"dur":2,"text":"You have to say to the country, we're in a global world,"},"3799":{"dur":3,"text":"we want rules, it's gonna mean trade agreements,"},"3802":{"dur":3,"text":"and I am gonna lead the way, and we are gonna do it"},"3806":{"dur":3,"text":"together because it's good for us, not bad for us."},"3809":{"dur":3,"text":"We play by the rules generally in the United States,"},"3812":{"dur":1,"text":"and some others don't."},"3814":{"dur":1,"text":"So we wanna level the playing field."},"3816":{"dur":2,"text":"It's very simply, but she's got to do it."},"3818":{"dur":3,"text":"In this campaign, one candidate doesn't understand it,"},"3822":{"dur":2,"text":"and the other has run away from it."},"3824":{"dur":3,"text":"So starting on the ninth, literally on the ninth,"},"3828":{"dur":2,"text":"she's going to have to start to bring the country together"},"3831":{"dur":2,"text":"and talk directly to it and be honest"},"3833":{"dur":3,"text":"with where we are and what we have to confront."},"3840":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Student] Thank you very much."},"3841":{"dur":1,"text":"This is a really wonderful conversation,"},"3842":{"dur":1,"text":"thanks to all of you."},"3843":{"dur":1,"text":"I just wanna throw out two questions."},"3845":{"dur":2,"text":"One is, this is always very nuanced,"},"3847":{"dur":2,"text":"but our other candidate, Hillary, is very fraud as well,"},"3849":{"dur":1,"text":"and we have WikiLeaks coming out,"},"3851":{"dur":2,"text":"and I think it's easy for to come out and say,"},"3853":{"dur":2,"text":"trust me, I know what's best for us,"},"3856":{"dur":1,"text":"we're now gonna come together."},"3858":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm just curious what you think about that"},"3860":{"dur":2,"text":"because more people are probably more anger"},"3862":{"dur":4,"text":"and angst-ridden about that as well, so I'm just curious."},"3869":{"dur":2,"text":"- I'm sorry, could you repeat the question?"},"3872":{"dur":2,"text":"(shouting)"},"3881":{"dur":2,"text":"- Okay, again, specific policies."},"3884":{"dur":4,"text":"What exactly are we going to do about economic inequality?"},"3889":{"dur":3,"text":"And again, a lot of this, as Mr. Kantor pointed out,"},"3893":{"dur":1,"text":"goes to education."},"3894":{"dur":2,"text":"Biggest gap, both economically"},"3897":{"dur":2,"text":"and politically, is eduction."},"3899":{"dur":2,"text":"If you have a college degree, odds are"},"3902":{"dur":1,"text":"you're probably gonna do pretty well in this economy."},"3904":{"dur":2,"text":"Not perfect, but overall pretty well."},"3906":{"dur":2,"text":"No college degree, not so well,"},"3909":{"dur":2,"text":"and those are the folks who are voting for Trump."},"3911":{"dur":1,"text":"So what do we do?"},"3912":{"dur":2,"text":"What specific policies can we have"},"3916":{"dur":2,"text":"to advance the economic standing"},"3919":{"dur":2,"text":"of people without four year college degrees?"},"3922":{"dur":3,"text":"Something very specific, she can emphasize something"},"3925":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that we desperately need in this country,"},"3927":{"dur":1,"text":"community colleges."},"3928":{"dur":3,"text":"We vastly under-invest in community colleges."},"3932":{"dur":3,"text":"They're a tremendous resource for people"},"3935":{"dur":2,"text":"who want to get technical skills"},"3937":{"dur":2,"text":"but don't necessarily wanna go on to a four year degree."},"3940":{"dur":3,"text":"And so if Hillary Clinton were standing here"},"3944":{"dur":3,"text":"and asked me what specific policy she could pursue,"},"3947":{"dur":3,"text":"improve the status of community colleges."},"3957":{"dur":2,"text":"- [Student] So I wanted to make a comment"},"3959":{"dur":4,"text":"and maybe from the professors, Pitney and Courser,"},"3963":{"dur":1,"text":"get a response."},"3966":{"dur":2,"text":"Professor Courser, you've mentioned Mike Murphy"},"3969":{"dur":1,"text":"who we all know and like very much."},"3971":{"dur":2,"text":"I actually think that he and Jeb are the reason"},"3974":{"dur":2,"text":"that we have Donald Trump."},"3976":{"dur":3,"text":"The reason for that is we have 140 million dollars"},"3979":{"dur":2,"text":"in the Right to Rise super PAC"},"3982":{"dur":2,"text":"and not a penny spent on opposition research,"},"3985":{"dur":2,"text":"not a penny spent on investigators."},"3989":{"dur":3,"text":"Not a penny spent eliciting information,"},"3992":{"dur":2,"text":"like the Clintons have done in their campaign"},"3995":{"dur":1,"text":"for more than a year."},"3997":{"dur":3,"text":"Dozens of people working, millions of dollars being spent"},"4000":{"dur":3,"text":"to uncover and unearth dirt on Donald Trump,"},"4005":{"dur":3,"text":"which now is making some difference in the campaign."},"4008":{"dur":3,"text":"But instead, Murphy spent 42 million trying"},"4011":{"dur":4,"text":"to wipe out Marco Rubio, and none of the other candidates"},"4017":{"dur":3,"text":"had a penny to spend on opposition research."},"4020":{"dur":3,"text":"So what they did was they said oh, Donald Trump went broke,"},"4024":{"dur":3,"text":"Donald Trump stuff, you know, stiffed a contractor,"},"4027":{"dur":1,"text":"doesn't mean anything."},"4028":{"dur":2,"text":"You have to spend the money and do the work."},"4030":{"dur":2,"text":"If Trump would have withstood that"},"4033":{"dur":2,"text":"and still been the nominee, it's unlikely,"},"4036":{"dur":2,"text":"but it would be a situation, but they spent all the money"},"4039":{"dur":4,"text":"on media, television mostly, that was completely worthless."},"4044":{"dur":2,"text":"- Here I am put in the position of defending Mike,"},"4046":{"dur":4,"text":"but I'll try, and I'll say this, a couple of things."},"4051":{"dur":1,"text":"One, I think..."},"4053":{"dur":2,"text":"If you wanna talk about Citizens United disrupting"},"4056":{"dur":3,"text":"our politics, I think this idea of creating a super PAC"},"4059":{"dur":3,"text":"that can take unlimited funds, but cannot coordinate execs,"},"4062":{"dur":2,"text":"its activities with the main presidential campaign"},"4065":{"dur":3,"text":"is a mistake, and I think to me that was the biggest mistake"},"4069":{"dur":2,"text":"is creating this huge amount of money in a super PAC."},"4072":{"dur":3,"text":"I keep using this lame sci-fi analogy,"},"4075":{"dur":1,"text":"but for those of you who like Star Trek,"},"4077":{"dur":3,"text":"you take the saucer section and the engineering section."},"4080":{"dur":2,"text":"You divide them, so you've got two ships basically"},"4082":{"dur":1,"text":"who can't talk to each other."},"4084":{"dur":2,"text":"You can send signals, these kinds of things."},"4086":{"dur":3,"text":"I think having Mike be more directly involved with Jeb"},"4090":{"dur":2,"text":"and having those funds be better coordinated"},"4093":{"dur":1,"text":"would have been an advantage for Jeb,"},"4094":{"dur":2,"text":"but to talk about the strategy,"},"4096":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't think the Bush campaign was alone"},"4100":{"dur":2,"text":"in just not seeing Donald Trump as a threat."},"4103":{"dur":4,"text":"I think Mike has said and I've heard from Cruz's"},"4107":{"dur":3,"text":"campaign chair as well that they had no idea"},"4111":{"dur":2,"text":"that Donald Trump would persist,"},"4114":{"dur":2,"text":"that he would be the challenge,"},"4117":{"dur":2,"text":"and they ended up basically aiming their fire"},"4120":{"dur":2,"text":"at each other and allowing Donald Trump to rise"},"4122":{"dur":2,"text":"sort of uncriticized, and then the last part of this"},"4125":{"dur":3,"text":"is that Mike and others, they did the testing"},"4129":{"dur":2,"text":"on Trump voters, they started throwing the horribles"},"4131":{"dur":2,"text":"at the Trump voters, saying who he was, what he did,"},"4134":{"dur":1,"text":"do you know who this guy is?"},"4136":{"dur":2,"text":"They don't care, they don't care."},"4138":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that's been consistently proven"},"4140":{"dur":1,"text":"by the fact that he became the nominee."},"4142":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, we may not have drilled down to the real dirt"},"4146":{"dur":2,"text":"of Donald Trump, but it was pretty much on the surface."},"4149":{"dur":2,"text":"He's not an angel, and he has a pretty dirty face."},"4152":{"dur":2,"text":"People knew that and they didn't care"},"4154":{"dur":2,"text":"I think because of a lot of things we've been talking about"},"4157":{"dur":2,"text":"in terms of frustration in the Republican electorate"},"4159":{"dur":2,"text":"at the so-called establishment."},"4162":{"dur":3,"text":"So I wouldn't blame the campaign chairs."},"4165":{"dur":4,"text":"I think I would blame them collectively for not seeing"},"4170":{"dur":3,"text":"what it was about Donald Trump that voters"},"4173":{"dur":2,"text":"really cared about, Republican primary voters in particular,"},"4176":{"dur":1,"text":"and that is he was speaking to them and saying,"},"4177":{"dur":1,"text":"you know what?"},"4179":{"dur":1,"text":"I see that there's something wrong with you guys,"},"4181":{"dur":1,"text":"and I'm gonna focus on it."},"4182":{"dur":2,"text":"He provides a kind of leadership, Donald Trump,"},"4184":{"dur":1,"text":"a very bad one, I think he leads us"},"4186":{"dur":2,"text":"to some pretty dark corners, but he is providing leadership"},"4189":{"dur":1,"text":"where really there was none on this issue of"},"4191":{"dur":3,"text":"what's going on in the middle of the country"},"4194":{"dur":3,"text":"with these white voters in particular"},"4197":{"dur":2,"text":"who don't have college educations?"},"4199":{"dur":1,"text":"When are we gonna talk to these people"},"4201":{"dur":3,"text":"and at least acknowledge their problems?"},"4204":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's what I would say about that."},"4206":{"dur":3,"text":"- If I may, there's an interesting point to be made here,"},"4209":{"dur":4,"text":"which is valid for both Europe and the United States is that"},"4215":{"dur":3,"text":"I think we've largely underestimated the degree"},"4219":{"dur":3,"text":"of complete separation and detachment"},"4222":{"dur":4,"text":"of populist voters both in Europe and the United States"},"4227":{"dur":2,"text":"from the mainstream parties."},"4229":{"dur":3,"text":"Most voters of the Front National in France"},"4233":{"dur":2,"text":"are not even receptive to any kind"},"4236":{"dur":4,"text":"of traditional political rhetoric whether it's about rights,"},"4242":{"dur":3,"text":"whether it's about economic benefits of trade,"},"4245":{"dur":4,"text":"whether it's about the necessity of a European policy,"},"4251":{"dur":3,"text":"of a foreign European policy, which we don't"},"4254":{"dur":2,"text":"really have for the time being."},"4257":{"dur":3,"text":"Those voters are now so totally detached"},"4263":{"dur":3,"text":"from traditional normative politics that"},"4268":{"dur":3,"text":"the parties, the traditional parties,"},"4271":{"dur":2,"text":"the government parties as we call them in Europe,"},"4274":{"dur":2,"text":"need to find another approach to that,"},"4277":{"dur":4,"text":"and there has been a lot of scholarship recently"},"4281":{"dur":2,"text":"on the responsibility, for example, in Europe"},"4284":{"dur":3,"text":"of center left parties in creating that vacuum"},"4289":{"dur":4,"text":"in which extreme right parties have surged literally,"},"4295":{"dur":3,"text":"but I do very much believe in your point that"},"4300":{"dur":3,"text":"those voters can no longer be reached"},"4305":{"dur":2,"text":"through traditional means."},"4308":{"dur":4,"text":"In France, for example, there was a debate this to"},"4312":{"dur":2,"text":"whether this was just a protest vote"},"4314":{"dur":4,"text":"and that those voters would come back into the fold"},"4319":{"dur":2,"text":"at one point, and this has gone..."},"4324":{"dur":2,"text":"We've gone way beyond that."},"4326":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Zachary] Jack, last word to you?"},"4327":{"dur":2,"text":"- Okay, unique challenge for opposition,"},"4330":{"dur":1,"text":"and I speak as an old oppo guy."},"4332":{"dur":1,"text":"Unique challenge for Trump is"},"4334":{"dur":1,"text":"it's not just votes and quotes."},"4335":{"dur":4,"text":"To do oppo on Trump, you need not only knowledge of policy"},"4340":{"dur":3,"text":"but the ability to read corporate documents,"},"4344":{"dur":3,"text":"to really drill down into the economics and financials"},"4348":{"dur":2,"text":"and understanding legal documents."},"4350":{"dur":3,"text":"You know who's uniquely qualified to do all that?"},"4353":{"dur":1,"text":"CMC students."},"4356":{"dur":4,"text":"So next time out, hire CMC students as oppo guys."},"4361":{"dur":1,"text":"- We've gotta stop now."},"4363":{"dur":1,"text":"Let me explain what's gonna happen."},"4364":{"dur":4,"text":"Our afternoon workers are gonna set up this room for lunch,"},"4370":{"dur":1,"text":"so we're gonna need to take a break."},"4372":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm gonna thank the panel, we'll have some applause"},"4374":{"dur":2,"text":"I hope, and then as soon as you can--"},"4376":{"dur":1,"text":"(applause)"},"4378":{"dur":1,"text":"And I wanna extend my thanks too."},"4380":{"dur":2,"text":"I think this was a really interesting

our students set up for lunch,"},"4388":{"dur":2,"text":"that'll make this whole process work easier."},"4391":{"dur":1,"text":"So thank you again for your attention,"},"4392":{"dur":1,"text":"and
