point."},"340":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'd like to try to characterize this wave"},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"and say that it is reminiscent if we talk about"},"349":{"dur":1,"text":"the two previous intifadas."},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"Intifada is the Arab word for uprising."},"353":{"dur":2,"text":"It is reminiscent of the first intifada"},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"that plagued Israel and the

approximately six years."},"368":{"dur":4,"text":"What characterized that first wave was individual attacks"},"374":{"dur":3,"text":"by Palestinians very much focusing on stabbings,"},"378":{"dur":3,"text":"Molotov cocktails, stone throwing, and the like,"},"381":{"dur":2,"text":"and in that regard, what we see now is very similar."},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"It's people taking the initiative,"},"386":{"dur":3,"text":"acting very much of their own volition."},"391":{"dur":3,"text":"Nevertheless there are a few remarkable differences."},"394":{"dur":3,"text":"Number one is that unlike the first Intifada and of course"},"398":{"dur":3,"text":"the second Intifada this one seems to be unorganized"},"402":{"dur":1,"text":"or unaffiliated."},"403":{"dur":3,"text":"The attackers in most cases have no criminal records"},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"and they don't belong to any official recognized"},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"Palestinian organization."},"411":{"dur":2,"text":"Part of the reason for that is because many of these attacks"},"413":{"dur":3,"text":"are eminent and from Jerusalem and Jerusalem itself,"},"417":{"dur":2,"text":"the city, the Palestinian population in Jerusalem"},"419":{"dur":3,"text":"is usually unaffiliated politically."},"423":{"dur":4,"text":"The parties, the factions, Fata, Hamas, the popular front"},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"for the liberation of Palestine, and other factions"},"431":{"dur":3,"text":"which exist very much in the west bank,"},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"and in Gaza have been almost annihilated"},"438":{"dur":4,"text":"or dissolved by Israeli authorities over the years"},"443":{"dur":1,"text":"in Jerusalem."},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"So a lot of the people here who come from"},"447":{"dur":3,"text":"the city of Jerusalem or its suburbs aren't affiliated."},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"The characteristic in this wave of violence"},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"which is not similar to the previous ones"},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"is the really young age of the perpetrators."},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"This is very much sometimes it's known as"},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"the Jerusalem Intifada or the third Intifada."},"463":{"dur":3,"text":"I would characterize it as the teenage Intifada."},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"The average age of the attackers from the Palestinian side"},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"is around 19 or 20 in average."},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"The youngest attacker we've seen was 13 years old,"},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"he critically injured another 13 year old in"},"478":{"dur":3,"text":"northern Jerusalem about two weeks ago."},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"So the young age is something that we also have to"},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"think about when we analyze this."},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"And finally, another interesting characteristic"},"490":{"dur":4,"text":"is the high participation of women in these acts."},"495":{"dur":4,"text":"Many more women involved this time than in previous rounds."},"499":{"dur":3,"text":"So what I'd like to do now is look at"},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"the narratives at how each side of this sees it"},"508":{"dur":4,"text":"and this is important because I think more than ever before"},"512":{"dur":3,"text":"we see discrepancy, a divergence in narrative,"},"516":{"dur":3,"text":"not only in interpreting what's happening on the ground"},"520":{"dur":4,"text":"and explaining what's happening, but even acknowledging"},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"the facts of the events themselves."},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"There's even a disagreement between Israelis"},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"and Palestinians as to whether someone was trying"},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"to stab someone else or whether someone was killed"},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"in cold blood on a street for no reason."},"537":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's start with the Palestinian narrative"},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"and this narrative of explaining why the violence erupted"},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"now focuses very much on the slogan of Al-Aqsa"},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"is in danger."},"555":{"dur":3,"text":"Now even the word Al-Aqsa itself needs some interpretation"},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"because what you see in the picture down here"},"562":{"dur":1,"text":"is a mosque called the Al-Aqsa Mosque."},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"It's on the southern edge of the temple mountain"},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"in the old city of Jerusalem."},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"It's one of the oldest Islamic structures"},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"in the world."},"572":{"dur":4,"text":"It was built very soon after the Muslim's occupied"},"576":{"dur":4,"text":"or conquered Jerusalem at the end of the 7th century"},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"and it continues to serve as a mosque til today."},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"But when Muslims and Palestinians say Al-Aqsa"},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"they don't just mean the mosque, they don't just"},"587":{"dur":1,"text":"mean the structure."},"589":{"dur":4,"text":"They mean the entire plaza of 37 acres which I'll show you"},"593":{"dur":1,"text":"in a slide in a minute."},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"So this slogan, Al-Aqsa is in danger as sort of a general"},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"call to arms or alert by Palestinians has taken"},"603":{"dur":4,"text":"various shades or various meanings by different people"},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"depending who's saying it."},"612":{"dur":3,"text":"The more moderate interpretation of this being used"},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"is that there's a danger that what is known as"},"617":{"dur":3,"text":"the status quo on Temple Mount will be changed"},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"somehow by Israel unilaterally without consulting"},"623":{"dur":1,"text":"the Palestinians."},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"So at the moment, the status quo and this has been"},"627":{"dur":3,"text":"a situation since 1967 when Israel occupied"},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"east Jerusalem and also the west bank,"},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"but the old city of Jerusalem came under Israel's possession"},"636":{"dur":0,"text":"in 1967."},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"The status quo has been that Muslims are allowed"},"642":{"dur":4,"text":"to pray on Temple Mount, namely in the Al-Aqsa Mosque"},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"and Jews and Christians and other religions"},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"are only allowed to go there as tourists"},"651":{"dur":3,"text":"and are completely prohibited from praying"},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"and this is being enforced by Jordanian officials,"},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"clerks of the Jordanian government known as"},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"the Islamic Waf, basically employees of the Ministry"},"663":{"dur":3,"text":"of Endowments of Jordan who monitor visitors"},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"to make sure that they don't pray."},"669":{"dur":1,"text":"And I actually visited the Temple Mount"},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"for the first time in my life even having grown up"},"673":{"dur":1,"text":"in Jerusalem."},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"I only visited there about a month ago"},"677":{"dur":3,"text":"for the first time and if you're suspected by the police"},"681":{"dur":3,"text":"coming into the mountain as someone who might cause trouble"},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"from the Jewish side I'm saying."},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're wearing one of these things on your head,"},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"a kippah, then you're immediately branded"},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"as someone who might cause trouble and you are"},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"grouped together with other people who look like you"},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"as potential dangers and then you are escorted"},"700":{"dur":4,"text":"by five policemen and five Waf people that was bigger"},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"than the group that I was in."},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"There are more people escorting you than the group"},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"and you're allowed to walk along the perimeter"},"712":{"dur":4,"text":"of the Temple Mount and not veer from there at all."},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"And all the while you have Jordanian or Palestinian"},"719":{"dur":1,"text":"officials with walkie talkies making sure"},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"that you don't mumble."},"723":{"dur":1,"text":"Some people do mumble by the way,"},"724":{"dur":1,"text":"and they don't always get away with it."},"726":{"dur":1,"text":"Sometimes they get arrested."},"727":{"dur":3,"text":"That has been the status quo and when people like"},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"Mahmoud Abbas for example, the Palestinian President,"},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"or Arab politicians, members of Conasit in Israel say,"},"737":{"dur":1,"text":"Al-Aqsa is in danger."},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"When they break it down they say what is in danger"},"742":{"dur":1,"text":"is the status quo."},"743":{"dur":3,"text":"Jews who have not been allowed to pray here before"},"746":{"dur":3,"text":"now want to push us out, they want to divide prayer times"},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"on the Temple Mount and they want to change the situation"},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"as it's been under Israel for almost 50 years"},"757":{"dur":3,"text":"and under Islamic rule for Millennia when Jews weren't"},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"allowed to pray there at all."},"763":{"dur":1,"text":"But there's a more extreme version of"},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"the Al-Aqsa is in danger which comes from people"},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"like the Islamic movement in Israel"},"771":{"dur":1,"text":"which is still a legal movement even though some people"},"773":{"dur":4,"text":"are working now to outlaw it, trying to do that,"},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"who talk about actually aspirations of certain Jewish"},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"groups to destroy the Al-Aqsa Mosque"},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"and here they actually do mean the physical structure"},"785":{"dur":4,"text":"in the picture and replace it with a third Jewish temple."},"790":{"dur":1,"text":"So when they talk about Al-Aqsa,"},"791":{"dur":1,"text":"people like the head of the Islamic movement in Israel"},"793":{"dur":4,"text":"Ride Salah, actually say the Jews want to destroy"},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"the structure, either this structure or the dome"},"799":{"dur":3,"text":"of the rock and replace it with another temple."},"804":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's the perceived immediate cause"},"807":{"dur":3,"text":"of this uprising from the Palestinian side."},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"A few words about, I've already gone into it a little bit,"},"815":{"dur":1,"text":"but let me expand a little bit about what"},"817":{"dur":1,"text":"the Temple Mount is."},"820":{"dur":4,"text":"So here's an ariel, a nice ariel picture I found."},"826":{"dur":2,"text":"The Temple Mount is basically a plaza that was"},"829":{"dur":3,"text":"constructed by King Herod 2000 years ago."},"832":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean the plaza existed, King Herod expanded it"},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"with the walls that you see and that surround it."},"838":{"dur":2,"text":"So the Western Wall where Jews traditionally pray"},"840":{"dur":3,"text":"is just the western wall of this supporting wall of this"},"843":{"dur":1,"text":"37 acre elevated plaza."},"847":{"dur":2,"text":"37 acres might not seem so big and it isn't huge"},"850":{"dur":2,"text":"but it still takes up about one sixth of the size"},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"of the old city of Jerusalem."},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"So the old city of Jerusalem which is very densely"},"857":{"dur":3,"text":"populated by Muslims, Christians, and Jews,"},"860":{"dur":2,"text":"there's this huge kind of park, open park,"},"863":{"dur":4,"text":"open plaza in the middle of it which has two imposing"},"867":{"dur":1,"text":"structures on it."},"868":{"dur":3,"text":"On the southern edge of it, and this is a view"},"871":{"dur":2,"text":"from the south, you can see the Al-Aqsa Mosque"},"874":{"dur":3,"text":"with the silver dome or the gray dome"},"878":{"dur":2,"text":"and in the center, right in the middle of the Temple Mount"},"881":{"dur":2,"text":"you see the dome of the rock."},"883":{"dur":3,"text":"The gold and the beautiful structure, this hexagon"},"886":{"dur":1,"text":"with a golden dome on it."},"888":{"dur":2,"text":"Both structures were built at the end of the 7th century"},"890":{"dur":3,"text":"by really the first Islamic rulers who ruled"},"895":{"dur":4,"text":"from Damascus, the Amiads, built not much more than 60 years"},"900":{"dur":1,"text":"after the death of the Prophet Mohammed,"},"902":{"dur":3,"text":"so really one of the oldest structures in Islam."},"905":{"dur":1,"text":"The reason why the dome of the rock"},"907":{"dur":2,"text":"is built where it is according to Islamic tradition"},"909":{"dur":4,"text":"is because that's where the sacrifice took place"},"914":{"dur":3,"text":"and that's the foundation rock of the world."},"917":{"dur":2,"text":"These are ancient traditions, these are ancient Christian"},"919":{"dur":1,"text":"and Jewish traditions that speak about the world"},"921":{"dur":2,"text":"being created from Jerusalem."},"924":{"dur":3,"text":"So this, so the dome of the rock is built"},"927":{"dur":2,"text":"as a dome structure over a central rock"},"930":{"dur":2,"text":"which pilgrims are supposed to circle"},"932":{"dur":3,"text":"as they come to the site and it was built very much"},"935":{"dur":4,"text":"to challenge or to imitate another very important"},"939":{"dur":3,"text":"structure in the old city, the church of the Holy Sepulcher"},"943":{"dur":4,"text":"where Jesus Christ is believed by Christians to have died"},"948":{"dur":3,"text":"and arisen and where people also circle the same

relic."},"959":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is the Temple Mount."},"961":{"dur":2,"text":"It's also the site needless to say where Jews believe"},"964":{"dur":2,"text":"and there's archeological evidence for this"},"966":{"dur":3,"text":"that the two temples that were the holiest site"},"970":{"dur":1,"text":"for Jews existed."},"971":{"dur":2,"text":"One that was destroyed at about 500 BCE"},"974":{"dur":3,"text":"by the Babylonians and the second which was destroyed"},"977":{"dur":1,"text":"at 70 by the Romans."},"980":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is a contested site."},"984":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a site that is holy to certainly to Islam"},"987":{"dur":2,"text":"and Judaism and is very much a contested site."},"990":{"dur":2,"text":"It's considered by Islam to be the third most important"},"993":{"dur":2,"text":"site after Mecca and Medina and by Judaism"},"995":{"dur":1,"text":"to be the most holy site."},"997":{"dur":2,"text":"So holy in fact that for
