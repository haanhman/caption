by\nan artist called Albert Irvin."},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"Interestingly, when this image\nwas dropped into Keynote,"},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"he actually cropped it,\nwhich wasn't

Albert."},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"I think at this point\nit's probably better"},"465":{"dur":4,"text":"I hand over to Paul, but as\na bit of a kind of segue,"},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"the point we'd reached\nthere after thinking of all"},"471":{"dur":3,"text":"these things was augmented\nreality-- what is it"},"474":{"dur":4,"text":"and how could we use\nit for this purpose?"},"478":{"dur":0,"text":"Yeah."},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"I guess I'm going to\ncome out on the design"},"481":{"dur":1,"text":"and the technical aspects."},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"I guess we were coming\nfrom this idea of what's"},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"the most advanced thing you can\ndo, because that would be cool."},"489":{"dur":3,"text":"But yet what's acceptable--\nboth acceptable to the user,"},"492":{"dur":4,"text":"but also acceptable to the\ngallery, because of the artists"},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"in terms of the work."},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I've shown the video."},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"I thought in terms of the\ndesign and the technical thing,"},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"I could tell you\nspecifically how we did it,"},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"but I guess I felt it was more\nimportant to say, what are"},"510":{"dur":3,"text":"the choices that you have to\nmake with augmented reality?"},"513":{"dur":0,"text":"What is it?"},"514":{"dur":1,"text":"And how does it work?"},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"So augmented reality fits\nin this thing from the real"},"518":{"dur":3,"text":"to the virtual, and it's\na specific point in space."},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"Augmented reality means\nwe take virtual objects"},"524":{"dur":3,"text":"and we've overlay them on\nthe real world video scene,"},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"usually."},"529":{"dur":3,"text":"Augmented virtuality is\nyou take a real object"},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"and you put it in a virtual\nworld, which is often"},"535":{"dur":3,"text":"used by doctors'\nsimulators, where"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"you put an object in that space."},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're working this\naugmented reality"},"542":{"dur":4,"text":"and it spatially combines\nreal and virtual in real time."},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"And the spatial thing\nis really important"},"549":{"dur":4,"text":"because it has to know\nwhere it's looking."},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"So when you see captions\nover a football match,"},"556":{"dur":1,"text":"that's not augmented reality."},"558":{"dur":1,"text":"That's just an overlay."},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"If it's not done in real time,\nfor movies, so Gollum is not"},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"augmented reality,\nthat's rendered offline."},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"So it has to work\nwhen the user moves it"},"569":{"dur":1,"text":"and it has to happen in a thing."},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's augmented reality."},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"In terms of mobile, you've\ngot a couple of choices"},"574":{"dur":0,"text":"at the moment."},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"You could either\ngo wearable, which"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"used to be like these giant\nhelmets you used to wear,"},"579":{"dur":0,"text":"which were great."},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"And you had a backpack\nfull of technology"},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"and you looked ridiculous."},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"So now we're moving to things\nlike Google Glass and Oculus"},"588":{"dur":3,"text":"So you can actually\nmake it more wearable"},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"and these are often\ncalled more immersive"},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"because it's always in vision."},"596":{"dur":3,"text":"The phone is often called\nthe magic lens approach"},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"where you've got a magic thing\nyou look through and see it."},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you want to\ndo more people,"},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"then the phone's\nthe obvious option,"},"608":{"dur":3,"text":"but you know that may well\nchange in a year or two."},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"In terms of what\nyou have to do is"},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"that you get a frame\nfrom the camera, a video,"},"617":{"dur":3,"text":"you have to know where this\ncamera is in space, so I have"},"620":{"dur":1,"text":"to know I'm looking\nat this screen."},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"I then have to take\nany virtual objects"},"625":{"dur":1,"text":"and put them where\nthey should be."},"626":{"dur":3,"text":"And then I have to\nrender the user import"},"630":{"dur":3,"text":"and I have to do that\nthirty times a second"},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"to make it look really good."},"636":{"dur":3,"text":"The biggest thing is\nestimating where the camera is,"},"640":{"dur":3,"text":"and this is where again you\nget different types of AR."},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"You can either do\nit by sensor base,"},"645":{"dur":4,"text":"so you can use GPS, compass,\nphone accelerometers, things"},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"like Wikitude does\nthat-- so then the app"},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"you see so it knows\nyou're in space."},"655":{"dur":1,"text":"The accuracy is pretty poor."},"657":{"dur":4,"text":"You've got 10 metres, maybe two\nor three metres on a good day."},"661":{"dur":1,"text":"So if you're trying\nto put somebody"},"663":{"dur":4,"text":"in front of a building,\nthen it'll be OK."},"668":{"dur":3,"text":"If you want to get down to\naccuracy say in a gallery,"},"671":{"dur":3,"text":"or in a museum where you want\nsomething to exist on a table,"},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"then you need other things."},"677":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's where the vision\nbonds comes in and use markers,"},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"because what you're\nlooking for, then"},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"you can estimate where\nto put it, basically."},"686":{"dur":1,"text":"And there are number\nof different ways."},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"The old way we use these\nblack and white things"},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"that look like bar codes."},"691":{"dur":1,"text":"Now we can use\npreset ones, so it"},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"could be any image\nwith a good texture."},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"Or what we're doing\nis letting the user"},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"define some of\ntheir own markers."},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"So what we want to\ndo is let people"},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"replace their\nphotographs and images"},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"at home with images\nfrom the gallery."},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"So you would look and you're\nsuddenly all your pictures"},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"change to things in the gallery."},"712":{"dur":3,"text":"You can use 3D objects what's\ncoming in the future will"},"715":{"dur":3,"text":"be that your phone actually\nacts like a 3D scanner"},"719":{"dur":3,"text":"and scans the whole environment\nand automatically does this."},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"But we'll need huge batteries\non our phones by then."},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"That may be some way off."},"728":{"dur":1,"text":"And we've also\nlooked at whether you"},"730":{"dur":1,"text":"do on device and in the cloud."},"732":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is really interesting\nin terms of the artwork."},"735":{"dur":5,"text":"If I make everything\nonline, on the device,"},"740":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm effectively loading all\nthe artwork on this phone."},"744":{"dur":1,"text":"And then if you know\nwhat you're doing,"},"745":{"dur":1,"text":"you could take it all off."},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"And we're trying to use really\nhigh Res images, so there's"},"749":{"dur":3,"text":"a balance between what you\nstore and what you give."},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"So the artists don't want us\nto store all their images,"},"755":{"dur":2,"text":"and then these go viral\nacross the network."},"758":{"dur":4,"text":"If you use the cloud for\neverything, so the images,"},"762":{"dur":4,"text":"then you're essentially\nrequiring a connection"},"766":{"dur":1,"text":"and a really good\none all the time."},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"You can come with\ncompromises in between."},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"So you only upload the\nreally low resolution ones"},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"at one time, and pull off\none's dynamically in the big."},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"But it's a choice to be\nmade, but it certainly"},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"has an effect in\nterms of the content."},"784":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's something we\nfound a lot with the work."},"787":{"dur":1,"text":"In terms of when we've\nbeen doing trials,"},"789":{"dur":3,"text":"there's some really unexpected\nthings you get with this."},"792":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is one of\nthe photographs"},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"that we've been using and\nall these magnificent men"},"799":{"dur":1,"text":"with tremendous moustaches."},"804":{"dur":2,"text":"One of the things where we\ngave the spotlight image"},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"was that things people started\nto look for the detail."},"809":{"dur":3,"text":"And what we found is that on one\nof the faces of the young boy,"},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"there's actually a\nfingerprint, which"},"815":{"dur":4,"text":"if you pick up the photograph,\nyou don't really notice."},"820":{"dur":3,"text":"But being able to go in and zoom\nin a look at the actual detail"},"824":{"dur":3,"text":"of it, you get this sort\nof fine granularity."},"827":{"dur":2,"text":"And you could pick out\nthese really weird things"},"830":{"dur":4,"text":"and see the brush\nstrokes on the work."},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"In terms of where\nwe're going next,"},"837":{"dur":3,"text":"we're changing the interface\nand we're and letting"},"840":{"dur":4,"text":"the users define\ntheir own markers."},"845":{"dur":2,"text":"And setting up a small\ncollection of three images"},"848":{"dur":2,"text":"that they can
