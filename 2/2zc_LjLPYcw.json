to\ncause someone,"},"324":{"dur":3,"text":"one side or the other, to\nsuffer as a result of it?"},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, a final point\nabout this, Mike,"},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's a really\nimportant one to bear in"},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"mind though, is that when\nyou look at it you can't"},"333":{"dur":2,"text":"just simply pull a\nsingular line out of a"},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"contract, you've got to\nlook at it in context,"},"337":{"dur":2,"text":"you've got to say how does\nthis fit into the contract"},"339":{"dur":2,"text":"as a whole and\nalso how clear,"},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"how transparent was this\nto the other side when"},"345":{"dur":1,"text":"they signed up?"},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"If they were\nwell-known to them,"},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"as we'll discuss later on,\nthen it may well be that"},"350":{"dur":1,"text":"it's not really unfair."},"351":{"dur":1,"text":"So there's some\nkey elements."},"353":{"dur":1,"text":"Mike?"},"354":{"dur":1,"text":"Look, well, thanks,\nthat's a very robust"},"355":{"dur":0,"text":"answer."},"356":{"dur":0,"text":"Thank you very much\nfor that,

I've got a slide\ncoming up here just to"},"365":{"dur":3,"text":"sort of give us a little\nbit of information here."},"368":{"dur":1,"text":"So if you could\ngive me some indications"},"370":{"dur":3,"text":"as to some of the - well,\nI'll actually tell you."},"374":{"dur":3,"text":"There's eight types of\nterms that the ACCC and"},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"ASIC consider to be\npotentially unfair and"},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"they are the right to\nunilaterally vary the"},"383":{"dur":3,"text":"contract, early\ntermination fees,"},"386":{"dur":3,"text":"limited

a"},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"larger business the right\nto unilaterally vary the"},"408":{"dur":1,"text":"contract?"},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"Yes, let's have a look at this\nidea of what's referred to"},"412":{"dur":3,"text":"as unilaterally varying\nsomething and really what"},"415":{"dur":3,"text":"that simply means is that\none side has the right to"},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"change part of the\ncontract without the"},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"agreement of the other\nside and that, of course,"},"423":{"dur":1,"text":"can be potentially unfair."},"425":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, sometimes these can\nbe about key elements of"},"428":{"dur":1,"text":"any contract."},"429":{"dur":1,"text":"For example, if one side\nin a commercial contract"},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"has the ability to change\nthe price the products are"},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"being offered, the\nnumber of products,"},"436":{"dur":2,"text":"the range of products\nthat its dealing with,"},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"then that can have a major\nimpact on the other party"},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"that have signed up to\nthe contract and it's"},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"especially unbalanced if\none side can do this,"},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"but the other one doesn't\nhave a reciprocal right."},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"For example, one firm may\nsay I'm going to change"},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"the price of a product,\nbut the other firm can't"},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"get out of the contract\neven if the new financial"},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"dynamics really don't make\nit worthwhile for it to"},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"stay in there anymore."},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"One of the examples we've\nalready encountered in the"},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"consumer area, but still\nhas relevance here to"},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"businesses, is ByteCard\nwhich was a case dealing"},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"with a firm that's also\nknown as NetSpeed Internet"},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"Communications and they\nhad an internet service"},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"arrangement that allowed\nthem to unilaterally,"},"477":{"dur":3,"text":"off their own back, vary\nthe price of the contract"},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"without giving their\ncustomers any right to"},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"terminate the contract."},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"So, in effect, the\ncustomer was trapped into"},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"the contract regardless\nand forced to pay whatever"},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"the new price\nmight be which,"},"491":{"dur":1,"text":"as I pointed\nout just then,"},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"could be set by the firm\nwhenever and however they"},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"wanted it to be."},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think most of us\nwould see that that's"},"499":{"dur":1,"text":"unfair and in this case\nthat was one that a court"},"500":{"dur":1,"text":"did find unfair."},"502":{"dur":1,"text":"Back to you, Mike."},"503":{"dur":0,"text":"Indeed."},"504":{"dur":1,"text":"Look, Brett, we haven't\nforgotten that you're"},"506":{"dur":0,"text":"there."},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"Could you please tell us\nabout early termination"},"508":{"dur":1,"text":"fees?"},"509":{"dur":0,"text":"Sure, Mike."},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll talk about it in\nthree specific areas."},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll talk firstly

an\nearly termination fee may"},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"actually look like in\nrespect of their day to"},"521":{"dur":1,"text":"day lives, and the third\nthing I'll talk about are"},"523":{"dur":4,"text":"what we look at or get\nconcerned about in respect"},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"of early termination fees."},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"So, in respect of what\nan early termination fee"},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"is, it's nothing more or\nless than somebody - one"},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"party to a contract having\nto pay the other party to"},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"the contract as a result\nof wanting to terminate"},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"their contract early."},"542":{"dur":2,"text":"The party that actually\nwants to terminate the"},"545":{"dur":3,"text":"contract early has to pay\nsomething as a result of"},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"having to do so and\nthe reason, Mike,"},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"that they do that is\nbecause it's quite"},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"appropriate and reasonable\nin certain circumstances"},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"for the party that is\nactually suffering a loss"},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"as a result of that\ntermination being entitled"},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"to a payment."},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's, in effect, what\nan early termination fee"},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"is or an early\ntermination clause is."},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"In respect of where our\nviewers might actually see"},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"it on a day to day basis,\nthe simplest example I can"},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"give is in respect\nof consumer leases."},"575":{"dur":4,"text":"So if you have a fixed\nterm contract to lease"},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"goods or services or a\nproduct for a fixed period"},"582":{"dur":3,"text":"of time, generally what\nhappens at the end of that"},"585":{"dur":3,"text":"period of time you have\nto make a decision do you"},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"want to continue\nwith the lease,"},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"at which time you\nwill roll it over,"},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"or do you want to get out\nof the lease and terminate"},"596":{"dur":1,"text":"the lease."},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"What often happens is\npeople don't make that"},"599":{"dur":1,"text":"determination."},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"That is, they don't\nactually make a decision"},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"that they want to stop the\nlease or they want it to"},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"roll over, so what\ngenerally happens is at"},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"the end of the fixed\nterm the contract will"},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"automatically roll over."},"612":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, if the contract\nautomatically rolls over"},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"and you, as the person\nthat's actually renting"},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"or leasing the goods or"},"620":{"dur":3,"text":"services want to get\nout of that contract,"},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"then you will\nhave to pay what we're"},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"talking about, the\nearly termination fee."},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's pretty\nmuch, Mike,"},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"how it works in respect\nof general day to day"},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"activities."},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"What do we get concerned\nabout in respect of early"},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"termination fees?"},"637":{"dur":1,"text":"There's a couple\nof things."},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"Michael Schaper has\nalready made mention of"},"640":{"dur":2,"text":"the term unilateral\nvariation."},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"One concern that we have\nabout early termination"},"645":{"dur":3,"text":"fees is where the party\nthat has to pay the early"},"649":{"dur":3,"text":"termination fee doesn't\nactually know that that"},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"termination fee is either\nin the contract or has"},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"been varied."},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"That's a concern for us."},"657":{"dur":3,"text":"So what are the key things\nthat we look at in respect"},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"of whether or not an early\ntermination fee may be"},"663":{"dur":1,"text":"unfair?"},"664":{"dur":2,"text":"We look at things such as\ndo both parties to the"},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"contract, including the\nparty that has to pay the"},"669":{"dur":4,"text":"early termination fee\nknow of its existence?"},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"That in itself is not\nnecessarily enough."},"675":{"dur":3,"text":"What we also are concerned\nabout ensuring is that the"},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"party that's paying the\nearly termination fees"},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"understands\nwhat the fee is,"},"684":{"dur":3,"text":"how much they have to\npay and, importantly,"},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"how that fee\nis calculated."},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"The third thing that we're\nreally focussed on making"},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"sure that people\nunderstand is that"},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"disclosure is really,\nreally important."},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"Parties have to understand\nwhen they can vary a"},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"contract, how they go\nabout varying the contract"},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"and, importantly, what the\ntermination fee looks like"},"705":{"dur":1,"text":"at the end."},"706":{"dur":4,"text":"So, in general, we look at\nall of those things in the"},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"holistic view."},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"An early termination fee\nin itself may not be"},"714":{"dur":1,"text":"unfair."},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"You need to look at those\nother issues that I've"},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"spoken about around\nwhat the fee is itself,"},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"how it's calculated,\nis there sufficient"},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"disclosure, et\ncetera, Mike,"},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"before making a\ndetermination that the"},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"early termination fee\nis in fact unfair."},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"Dr Michael\nSchaper, ACCC,"},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"has the ACCC got a view\nabout automatic renewals"},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"and can you please tell us\na little bit about this?"},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah, Mike, I think\nthat's a really important"},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"one of that list there of\nthe eight that we've got up"},"738":{"dur":1,"text":"there."},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"Automatic renewals are an\nimportant issue and this"},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"often occurs when\na

can\nput up another slide,"},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll give you an example\nof this here that we've"},"753":{"dur":1,"text":"encountered recently."},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"And we did this\nin our consumer unfair"},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"contract terms context,\nbut it's still very"},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"relevant, I think,\nin terms of the same"},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"situation applying\ndirectly to small"},"763":{"dur":1,"text":"businesses."},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, in the case of\nChrisco Hampers it wasn't"},"767":{"dur":1,"text":"quite an automatic\nrenewal,"},"769":{"dur":2,"text":"but if you have a look\nat the information there"},"771":{"dur":3,"text":"basically customers were\nsigning up and then unless"},"774":{"dur":3,"text":"they chose to opt out of\nthe contract with a very"},"778":{"dur":2,"text":"large degree of\nnotice beforehand,"},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"they were effectively\nlocked into a following"},"782":{"dur":1,"text":"contract the year after."},"783":{"dur":3,"text":"So, we've got some real\nconcerns about similar"},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"arrangements applying to\nsmall
