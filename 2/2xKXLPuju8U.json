right\nfor each other,"},"45":{"dur":2,"text":"or we don't have enough in common."},"48":{"dur":4,"text":"Look, it's not just you, or him, or her."},"53":{"dur":4,"text":"There's actually nothing more difficult\non the planet than another person."},"59":{"dur":1,"text":"Think about that."},"61":{"dur":1,"text":"We're all difficult;"},"63":{"dur":3,"text":"we all come to each new

relationships."},"73":{"dur":2,"text":"Between love and work,"},"75":{"dur":4,"text":"love is by far,\nmore complex and challenging."},"79":{"dur":5,"text":"Much of the reason for this is based\nin our automatic neurobiological reflexes,"},"84":{"dur":1,"text":"so let me explain."},"87":{"dur":4,"text":"Let's start with that fancy neocortex\nof yours, the high cortical areas."},"92":{"dur":4,"text":"For simplicity sake,\nlet's call them your ambassadors."},"97":{"dur":5,"text":"Your ambassadors are\nvery smart, deliberate, but slow;"},"102":{"dur":2,"text":"and they're very expensive to run."},"105":{"dur":5,"text":"They're really good at planning,\npredicting, organizing, languaging"},"110":{"dur":3,"text":"and if I may be frank,\nthey're really good at making shit up."},"114":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"115":{"dur":4,"text":"When you think of logic and reason,\nthink ambassadors."},"120":{"dur":5,"text":"The subcortical areas of your brain,\nlet's call them your primitives;"},"125":{"dur":5,"text":"they're very fast, memory-based,\nautomatic, and very cheap to run."},"131":{"dur":5,"text":"They're involved in love and sex,\nbut also threat detection"},"136":{"dur":5,"text":"by scanning for dangerous faces,\nvoices, gestures, movements,"},"141":{"dur":3,"text":"as well as dangerous words and phrases."},"144":{"dur":3,"text":"When you think fight or flight,\nthink primitives."},"149":{"dur":6,"text":"Thanks to your primitives,\nyour day is 99% fully automatic."},"156":{"dur":1,"text":"Your ambassadors love novelty,"},"158":{"dur":2,"text":"but they have to offload\nnewness to your primitives"},"161":{"dur":2,"text":"in order to conserve resources."},"163":{"dur":3,"text":"You can't possibly run your day\nwith your ambassadors in full gear;"},"167":{"dur":2,"text":"you would fry your brain."},"169":{"dur":3,"text":"So the primitives use something\ncalled procedural memory,"},"173":{"dur":3,"text":"otherwise known as body memory,\nand it works like this:"},"178":{"dur":3,"text":"you learn to ride a bike;\nand in the beginning,"},"181":{"dur":5,"text":"your primitives and ambassadors are\nin full gear to learn this new skill,"},"186":{"dur":4,"text":"but very soon, your primitives\nare going to automate bike riding"},"191":{"dur":2,"text":"without much need for your ambassadors."},"194":{"dur":2,"text":"It goes into procedural memory."},"197":{"dur":1,"text":"Pretty neat, huh?"},"199":{"dur":5,"text":"Now you fall in love with someone,\nand again, your brain is lit up;"},"204":{"dur":1,"text":"you want to know everything about them."},"206":{"dur":4,"text":"You want to touch them, taste them,\nsmell them, you can't get enough of them."},"210":{"dur":2,"text":"You are high on drugs."},"213":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"214":{"dur":2,"text":"Nature's drugs, not those!"},"217":{"dur":2,"text":"Dopamine for wanting more,"},"219":{"dur":3,"text":"noradrenaline for focus and attention,"},"223":{"dur":3,"text":"testosterone for you know what,"},"226":{"dur":5,"text":"and a distinct drop in serotonin\nso you can perseverate and obsess."},"231":{"dur":3,"text":"You're neurochemically addicted."},"235":{"dur":5,"text":"You spend all your time together\nfor weeks and months;"},"240":{"dur":4,"text":"you get serious, and this is\nwhen the fun begins,"},"245":{"dur":3,"text":"because very soon, your brain\nis going to automate this new person"},"248":{"dur":3,"text":"and theirs is going to automate you."},"251":{"dur":1,"text":"This is supposed to happen,"},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"it's what the brain does\nin order to function."},"256":{"dur":3,"text":"It'll make your relationship\nfeel a lot easier"},"260":{"dur":3,"text":"and it will lead you\nto your first really big mistakes"},"264":{"dur":2,"text":"because you think\nyou know each other already"},"266":{"dur":3,"text":"so you stop paying attention,\nyou stop being fully present."},"271":{"dur":3,"text":"Your primitives are relying on\nprocedural memory"},"275":{"dur":1,"text":"to run your relationship,"},"276":{"dur":3,"text":"and that memory includes\neveryone and everything"},"279":{"dur":2,"text":"of an emotional importance in your life."},"281":{"dur":3,"text":"That primitive brain of yours\nis going to read"},"285":{"dur":4,"text":"your partner's thoughts, feelings,\nand intentions through that memory lens."},"290":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's kind of like this,"},"294":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Why are you giving me that look?\""},"296":{"dur":1,"text":"\"I didn't give you any look.\""},"298":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Why are you using that tone\nof voice with

nervous systems misfiring,"},"309":{"dur":1,"text":"and that is our nature."},"311":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"312":{"dur":3,"text":"That will happen, and it will be a problem"},"316":{"dur":3,"text":"if you don't understand\nyour automatic brain."},"320":{"dur":1,"text":"As a couple's therapist,"},"321":{"dur":4,"text":"I can tell you that fighting\nin and of itself is inevitable."},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"There is no relationship without conflict."},"328":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, if you are a conflict avoider,"},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"you will appear\nthreatening to your partner."},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"The real problem isn't that you fight."},"338":{"dur":5,"text":"It's when you do, one or both of you\nthreatens to leave the relationship."},"344":{"dur":2,"text":"A relationship can survive fights,"},"346":{"dur":4,"text":"but what it cannot survive\nis loss of safety and security."},"352":{"dur":5,"text":"Communication, memory,\nperception - all error-prone."},"358":{"dur":3,"text":"Human communication,\neven on a good day, is terrible."},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"We're mostly misunderstanding\neach other much of the time;"},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"when we feel good,\nwe don't care that much,"},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"when we don't feel good,\nwe care a whole lot."},"368":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"371":{"dur":5,"text":"When stress goes up, human communication\ngets a whole lot worse."},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"Memory is unreliable."},"380":{"dur":4,"text":"Memory is faulty, folks,"},"384":{"dur":5,"text":"and in a fight for whose memory is right,\nyou're probably both wrong."},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"Your perceptions\nare like fun house mirrors."},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"Your perceptions are\nconstantly being altered"},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"by your state of mind\nand your memory."},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"They're constantly playing tricks on you."},"401":{"dur":1,"text":"If we assume"},"403":{"dur":5,"text":"our communication, our memory,\nour perception is the real truth,"},"408":{"dur":4,"text":"that's hubris,\nand that will get us into trouble."},"413":{"dur":4,"text":"Before I go on, I want\nto be clear about threat:"},"417":{"dur":3,"text":"if you're in an abusive relationship,\nyou must get out."},"420":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm not talking about big T threat;\nonly small T threat,"},"425":{"dur":3,"text":"the kind that we have to deal with\nday in and day out"},"429":{"dur":3,"text":"as we bump up\nagainst each other, and we fight."},"433":{"dur":3,"text":"But why do our fights spin out of control?"},"436":{"dur":3,"text":"It's because real time is too fast,"},"439":{"dur":3,"text":"and when we feel threatened,\nwe act, and react with our primitives."},"443":{"dur":3,"text":"Our ambassadors actually\nhave no idea how we got into this place."},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"It's what makes shit up!"},"448":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"449":{"dur":1,"text":"\"I'm right, dammit,"},"451":{"dur":3,"text":"and here's what sounds\nreally good to prove my point.\""},"454":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"You really have no idea\nwhat you're talking about"},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"but you sound so confident."},"463":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"I want to get to the fun part here."},"472":{"dur":4,"text":"Since all of you literally carry around\nyour own

time\na relationship moment turns tense,"},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"change your position;"},"491":{"dur":4,"text":"go eye-to-eye and face-to-face,\nnotice what happens."},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"And by the way,"},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"if you tend to fight a lot\nwhile driving in the car,"},"500":{"dur":3,"text":"it's because you're\nside-to-side and glance;"},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"a glance is a threat trigger,"},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"that's why you should never fight\nin the car, or on the phone,"},"508":{"dur":3,"text":"or while emailing, or while texting."},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"We're visual animals,\nand we need our eyes"},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"in order to regulate\neach other's nervous systems."},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"I want you to understand\nthat what I'm talking about
