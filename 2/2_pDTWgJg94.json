century."},"379":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think, one trend we'll see\nis the democratization of"},"382":{"dur":3,"text":"finance, that finance will\nbecome much more of

and\nmail in $100 to unicef.org,"},"491":{"dur":8,"text":"because the estimate, as of\n1996, is, that UNICEF can save"},"499":{"dur":3,"text":"a child's life for $3."},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"So, you will save the\nlives of 33 children"},"506":{"dur":1,"text":"for your $100 check."},"508":{"dur":0,"text":"How can they do that?"},"509":{"dur":1,"text":"How can they save a

are not getting."},"517":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, statistically, you can\nsave a child's life for $3."},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"So, he says, write out a check,\nbut of course, I can"},"526":{"dur":5,"text":"tell you what to do, and that\nis, just log on to that and"},"531":{"dur":1,"text":"get out your credit card."},"533":{"dur":4,"text":"And I don't know, if you can\nsave 33 lives with $100, but"},"538":{"dur":1,"text":"maybe you can."},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"So, when I first read the book,\nI thought about that,"},"544":{"dur":1,"text":"and then I turned the page --"},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"because most of us do --"},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"and I realized later, a month\nlater, that I never had"},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"written out $100 check."},"553":{"dur":1,"text":"So, I finally did."},"555":{"dur":4,"text":"I went on to unicef.org and\nI gave exactly $100, as he"},"559":{"dur":1,"text":"called for."},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"Then, I started --"},"562":{"dur":4,"text":"that was thought-provoking to\nthink about that, because why"},"567":{"dur":3,"text":"did I stop at $100?"},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"Why is it that most of\nus

and letting"},"611":{"dur":3,"text":"other people die."},"615":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think, it's really an\ninteresting book, because it"},"620":{"dur":3,"text":"is referring to a paradox\nof human behavior."},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"I think of this as at the\njuncture of philosophy and"},"626":{"dur":1,"text":"psychology."},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"And now, those two departments\nare starting to --"},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"I understand, I'm not in\neither one of them --"},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"they are starting to come\ntogether, because they're"},"633":{"dur":3,"text":"realizing that
