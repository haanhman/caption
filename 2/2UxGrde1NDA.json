instructions I was given,"},"75":{"dur":1,"text":"that it likes it dark and damp"},"77":{"dur":4,"text":"and its favorite food is porridge oats."},"81":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm an artist who's worked for many years"},"83":{"dur":2,"text":"with biology, with scientific processes,"},"86":{"dur":3,"text":"so living material is not uncommon for me."},"89":{"dur":2,"text":"I've worked with plants,

on,"},"232":{"dur":3,"text":"yet the slime mold slowed down in anticipation"},"235":{"dur":1,"text":"of it happening."},"236":{"dur":2,"text":"It somehow knew that it was about the time"},"239":{"dur":1,"text":"for the cold air that it didn't like."},"241":{"dur":1,"text":"The conclusion from their experiment"},"242":{"dur":3,"text":"was that the slime mold was able to learn."},"246":{"dur":1,"text":"A third experiment:"},"247":{"dur":1,"text":"the slime mold was invited"},"249":{"dur":4,"text":"to explore a territory covered in oats."},"253":{"dur":3,"text":"It fans out in a branching pattern."},"256":{"dur":2,"text":"As it goes, each food node it finds,"},"258":{"dur":2,"text":"it forms a network, a connection to,"},"261":{"dur":1,"text":"and keeps

there's nothing remarkable in this"},"271":{"dur":2,"text":"until you learn that the center oat that it started from"},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"represents the city of Tokyo,"},"275":{"dur":4,"text":"and

taken us well over 100 years"},"295":{"dur":3,"text":"took the slime mold just over a day."},"298":{"dur":1,"text":"The conclusion from their experiment"},"300":{"dur":2,"text":"was that the slime

lie?"},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is a microscopy, a video I shot,"},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's about 100 times magnification,"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"sped up about 20 times,"},"354":{"dur":1,"text":"and inside the slime mold,"},"356":{"dur":3,"text":"there is a rhythmic pulsing flow,"},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"a vein-like structure

understanding of its environment,"},"380":{"dur":3,"text":"but without any large-scale control center."},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"This is where its intelligence lies."},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's not just academic researchers"},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"in universities that are interested in this organism."},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"A few years ago, I set up SliMoCo,"},"394":{"dur":2,"text":"the

what amazing things it can do,"},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"and they design their own petri dish experiment,"},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"an environment for the slime mold to navigate"},"484":{"dur":1,"text":"so they can test its properties."},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"Everybody takes home a new pet"},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"and is invited to post their results"},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"on the Slime Mould Collective."},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"And the collective has enabled me"},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"to form collaborations"},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"with a whole array of interesting people."},"500":{"dur":1,"text":"I've been working with filmmakers"},"502":{"dur":3,"text":"on a feature-length slime mold documentary,"},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"and I

soon."},"513":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"It's also enabled me to conduct what I think is"},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"the world's first human slime mold experiment."},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"This is part of an exhibition in Rotterdam last year."},"523":{"dur":4,"text":"We invited people to become\nslime mold for half an hour."},"528":{"dur":3,"text":"So we essentially tied people together"},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"so they were a giant cell,"},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"and invited them to follow slime mold rules."},"537":{"dur":3,"text":"You have to communicate through oscillations,"},"540":{"dur":1,"text":"no speaking."},"541":{"dur":4,"text":"You have to operate as one entity, one mass cell,"},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"no egos,"},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"and the motivation for moving"},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"and then exploring the environment"},"552":{"dur":1,"text":"is in search of food."},"554":{"dur":3,"text":"So a chaotic shuffle ensued\nas this bunch of strangers"},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"tied together with yellow ropes\nwearing \"Being Slime Mold\"

sorts."},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"I can predict certain behaviors"},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"by understanding how it operates,"},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"but I can't control it."},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"The slime mold has the final say"},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"in the creative process."},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"And after all, it has its own internal aesthetics."},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"These branching
