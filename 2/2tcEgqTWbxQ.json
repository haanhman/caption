tell you"},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"how your supplements\nare interacting with things."},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"It's just really important\nfor you to do that,"},"631":{"dur":4,"text":"because things are really\nintertwined and interactive."},"635":{"dur":2,"text":"You generally want to get\nmost of your vitamins"},"638":{"dur":1,"text":"from fruits and vegetables,"},"640":{"dur":1,"text":"and not your supplements,"},"641":{"dur":3,"text":"but your doctor might ask you\nto use some supplements too."},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"And a good doctor knows how to do that."},"647":{"dur":5,"text":"So, for instance not having\nenough vitamin B12"},"652":{"dur":1,"text":"is linked to memory loss,"},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"but you can't just take supplements"},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"because you don't

driving."},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"The people who text\nhave 23 times the accident rate"},"707":{"dur":1,"text":"as the people who don't."},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"One study showed that it was equivalent"},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"to drinking four drinks\nand getting behind the wheel."},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"Someone's texting in the car,\ntell them to pull over."},"716":{"dur":1,"text":"If it's that important, pull over."},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"And second to last tip is"},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"the Mediterranean diet\nis fantastic for you."},"726":{"dur":3,"text":"It's one of the only proven diets\nto just really be good."},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"They also call it \"eating colorfully\"."},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"Mediterranean diet involves\nseven to ten servings"},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"of fruits and vegetables per day."},"737":{"dur":1,"text":"I know that sounds like a lot,"},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"but actually it's really hard\nto gain weight with fruits and vegetables."},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"So you actually end up\nfilling up with that"},"744":{"dur":1,"text":"and losing weight."},"745":{"dur":1,"text":"Fresh is best,"},"746":{"dur":1,"text":"thyme is second best."},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"Mediterranean diet people\nalso eat a lot of fish,"},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"preferably wild fish, twice a

a legume is."},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"763":{"dur":1,"text":"Those are peanuts and beans,"},"765":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"766":{"dur":4,"text":"and there's a real social component\nto the Mediterranean village diet as well."},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"So the last tip that I'm going to give you"},"773":{"dur":1,"text":"is that positive outlook matters,"},"775":{"dur":1,"text":"and it matters a lot."},"776":{"dur":3,"text":"If you would ask me as a scientist\nhow much I think this matters,"},"779":{"dur":1,"text":"I'd say it matters a little bit."},"781":{"dur":4,"text":"But it turns out that it matters\nmuch more than anybody ever thought."},"785":{"dur":4,"text":"What happens is that\nthere is a study called \"The Nun Study\"."},"790":{"dur":4,"text":"They tracked 600,078 nuns\nover the course of their lives,"},"794":{"dur":2,"text":"and a lot of the nuns even gave permission"},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"that upon

Alzheimer's."},"803":{"dur":1,"text":"They found that the nuns"},"804":{"dur":4,"text":"who had the highest usage\nof positive emotion words,"},"809":{"dur":1,"text":"so the highest positive outlook,"},"811":{"dur":2,"text":"not only aged better,"},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"and lived longer,\nand lived healthier lives,"},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"but also what was really startling was,"},"817":{"dur":3,"text":"in a few cases, when they opened up\nthe brains of these people,"},"821":{"dur":1,"text":"and they looked inside,"},"822":{"dur":3,"text":"there were tangles and plaques\nthat are associated with Alzheimer's,"},"825":{"dur":3,"text":"but they didn't have the symptoms\nthat are of Alzheimer's."},"828":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's this neuroprotective\neffect to positive outlook"},"832":{"dur":1,"text":"that is really, really great,"},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"and scientists are going\nto need to study it,"},"836":{"dur":1,"text":"but just so you know that's
