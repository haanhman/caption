thing."},"228":{"dur":1,"text":"swatching."},"229":{"dur":3,"text":"you definitely want to swatch before you start\nthis."},"232":{"dur":4,"text":"and i give you instructions for making this\ncute

your\nponcho turns out the same size."},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"and not huge or tiny compared to mine."},"256":{"dur":4,"text":"and what you're going to do is knit up a swatch,\nfollowing the instructions."},"261":{"dur":2,"text":"you can start with the same needle size that\ni used."},"263":{"dur":2,"text":"but your needle size may need to change."},"266":{"dur":1,"text":"and there is no

okay. we can adjust that with the\nneedle size."},"274":{"dur":5,"text":"so you'll knit up your swatch, you'll follow\nthe washing instructions on the yarn label."},"280":{"dur":3,"text":"to wash and block, or dry, your swatch."},"283":{"dur":4,"text":"and with this yarn that i used, i hand washed\nit in wool soap and set it out flat to dry."},"288":{"dur":3,"text":"and then once it's dry, you

and\nthe first thing that we're going to start"},"314":{"dur":9,"text":"with next is using the magic loop method."},"323":{"dur":1,"text":"i was just reminded of something."},"325":{"dur":3,"text":"i was going to call this the \"rodeo\" poncho."},"328":{"dur":3,"text":"and i decided against that, because in writing,\nit looks like 'rodeo' poncho."},"332":{"dur":3,"text":"which brings up a very different image of\nwhat this poncho looks like!"},"335":{"dur":1,"text":"[laughs]"},"336":{"dur":3,"text":"you wouldn't expect a rodeo poncho to be knit\nin cashmere yarn."},"340":{"dur":5,"text":"anyway, first up we're going to start with\nthe cast on, and using simple magic loop method."},"345":{"dur":4,"text":"and what i'm going to show you here is something\nyou can take on to lots of other projects."},"349":{"dur":5,"text":"because you'll find yourself knitting, wanting\nto make a hat, let's say, and a hat is not"},"355":{"dur":1,"text":"a very big tube."},"356":{"dur":3,"text":"but you only have long needles in the size\nthat you need to make this hat."},"360":{"dur":4,"text":"you can just use this magic loop method and\ncomplete the entire hat on the long circular"},"364":{"dur":1,"text":"needles."},"365":{"dur":5,"text":"it makes it so you don't have to have every\nsize, every length of circular needle."},"370":{"dur":2,"text":"um, we'll get started right on that."},"372":{"dur":4,"text":"let's go ahead and take a look first at my\nswatch."},"377":{"dur":4,"text":"i give instructions for knitting this in the\npattern because it has a garter stitch border"},"382":{"dur":3,"text":"and it just turned out to be such a beautiful\nswatch."},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"it was beautiful before i even blocked it."},"388":{"dur":2,"text":"the stitches just came out so evenly."},"391":{"dur":3,"text":"and looking at this, and seeing how nice the\nstitches look, this is a good argument for"},"394":{"dur":2,"text":"using luxury yarn, at least sometimes."},"397":{"dur":6,"text":"also with this yarn, um, the cashmere does\nwhat is called \"blooming\"."},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"it blooms as you knit with it."},"405":{"dur":5,"text":"the yarn looks really plain and just like\na regular worsted yarn until it passes through"},"410":{"dur":1,"text":"your fingers."},"411":{"dur":3,"text":"then the cashmere fluffs out, or that's what\nblooming is."},"415":{"dur":7,"text":"it fluffs out, or blooms a little bit, and\nit gives just barely a halo on the knitted"},"422":{"dur":1,"text":"piece."},"423":{"dur":5,"text":"and when i say luxury yarns, i guess maybe\ni should explain this a little bit."},"429":{"dur":3,"text":"i would say, if you don't want to use the\nyarn that i used here, another cashmere blend"},"432":{"dur":1,"text":"would be fine, of course."},"434":{"dur":6,"text":"or a merino, or an alpaca would also add a\nnice halo to the finished piece."},"440":{"dur":5,"text":"okay, let's look at an ideal situation here\nwith getting started."},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"these are 16\" circular needles."},"448":{"dur":7,"text":"and i happen to have an interchangeable set,\nwhich i am really glad i invested in."},"455":{"dur":5,"text":"and it's an interchangeable set where the\nneedle tips are really short, you see this"},"461":{"dur":1,"text":"here?"},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"they're really short to accomidate the really\nshort 16\" needle."},"465":{"dur":5,"text":"i'll give you a link to this Knitter's Pride\nneedle set in the video description below."},"470":{"dur":3,"text":"it wasn't very expensive, and it ended up\nbeing a pretty good investment."},"473":{"dur":6,"text":"and so to get started on the pattern, with\n16\" circular needles, it's really easy."},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's just a matter of joining in the round."},"482":{"dur":5,"text":"and please note, i'm using much bigger needles\nand much bulkier yarn than the pattern calls"},"488":{"dur":3,"text":"for, so that you can see what i'm doing."},"491":{"dur":4,"text":"so i cast on my stitches, and i used the long\ntail cast on i'll give you a link to this"},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"cast on method here on screen if you're not\nfamiliar with it."},"500":{"dur":1,"text":"just kind of a standard cast on."},"501":{"dur":5,"text":"i'm going to make sure that all of the knots\nfrom the cast on are on the inside of this"},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"loop, so it's not twisted."},"510":{"dur":3,"text":"i'm going to get my working yarn on the outside."},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"grab a stitch marker, put it on the right\nneedle."},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"make sure the stitches are all close to the\ntip of the needle."},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"and not twisted."},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"and then just start knitting."},"523":{"dur":7,"text":"i don't do anything fancy when i join."},"531":{"dur":3,"text":"and the first part of this pattern is garter\nstitch."},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"but because we're knitting it in the round,\nit's knit a row, purl a row, knit a row, purl"},"538":{"dur":1,"text":"a row."},"539":{"dur":5,"text":"so you see here that i am joined, and every\ntime i come up to the stitch marker it will"},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"count as one round."},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"something i want to show you."},"549":{"dur":4,"text":"you see here that i do have a gap at the join."},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"this is not an issue, unless it's really huge."},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"in subsequent rounds, this will disappear."},"559":{"dur":5,"text":"okay? so that is an ideal world, where everyone\nhas 16\" circulars."},"565":{"dur":5,"text":"let's get started on this with 32\" circulars."},"570":{"dur":5,"text":"so you see, my stitches here are never going\nto fit around on a cord this long."},"576":{"dur":1,"text":"that's where magic loop comes in!"},"577":{"dur":5,"text":"i have the same number of stitches cast on\nas i did for the short needles."},"583":{"dur":4,"text":"the first thing i want to do is find a spot\nsomewhere kind of in the middle of the stitches."},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"it does not matter."},"589":{"dur":3,"text":"and pull the cord long, right there."},"593":{"dur":5,"text":"so that your stitches all end up close to\nthe tip of the needle."},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"and i'm going to get them very close to the\ntip of the needle."},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"and now i want to make sure that nothing is\ntwisted."},"604":{"dur":4,"text":"and i can see that all of my knots are facing\ndown."},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"the working yarn is coming from the back needle."},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"and the needles are facing to the right."},"614":{"dur":3,"text":"this is the magic loop starting position."},"617":{"dur":4,"text":"you get youself into this position, and magic\nloop is a breeze from here on out."},"621":{"dur":5,"text":"so extra cord is hanging here, needles facing\nto the right, working yarn coming from the"},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"back needle."},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"grab the back needle and pull it long."},"631":{"dur":1,"text":"see there?"},"632":{"dur":8,"text":"now i have cord coming from two different\nspots."},"640":{"dur":5,"text":"i'm going to push the stitches very close\nto the tip of the left needle."},"645":{"dur":3,"text":"whoops! i forgot my stitch marker!"},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"my stitch marker goes there."},"652":{"dur":4,"text":"and i grab the working yarn, and not the tail."},"657":{"dur":4,"text":"and the first stitch is a little bit tricky,\nwhen you're starting, working in the round."},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"put my needle in, grab it, wrap it, and pull\nit through."},"664":{"dur":4,"text":"and then really give it a tug to eliminate\nthe drag between the two stitches."},"669":{"dur":1,"text":"and you're off!"},"670":{"dur":4,"text":"and you're going to have to wait for me to\nknit through this, half of the row, so i can"},"674":{"dur":10,"text":"show you what to do next."},"685":{"dur":26,"text":"the little metal stitch marker is hitting\nthe paper."},"712":{"dur":14,"text":"okay, so i've reached the end of this half,\nand there are no more stithes for me to work"},"726":{"dur":1,"text":"on the left needle."},"728":{"dur":4,"text":"so, i essentially turn the work."},"733":{"dur":4,"text":"and get myself back into the magic loop starting\nposition."},"738":{"dur":5,"text":"which is to get the needles both facing to\nthe right, both tips close together, stitches"},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"close to the tip of the left needle."},"746":{"dur":9,"text":"and then, just like i did before, i pull the\nback needle long, and then get going again."},"755":{"dur":3,"text":"and this one is going to be easier to start\nbecause i'm not joining in the round this"},"758":{"dur":3,"text":"time."},"762":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's it!"},"763":{"dur":1,"text":"that's how you work magic loop."},"765":{"dur":4,"text":"let me try to make this visually a little\neasier to understand."},"769":{"dur":5,"text":"i have extra cord coming out of two sides,\nand my stitches are kind of in the middle,"},"774":{"dur":1,"text":"as i work across."},"775":{"dur":6,"text":"once you get the hang of it, it's pretty easy."},"782":{"dur":14,"text":"next up we're going to go over make 1 stitches,\nand cable stitches, and counting cable rows."},"796":{"dur":3,"text":"once you get past the neck border, which is\njust knit a row, purl a row, that's when you"},"800":{"dur":2,"text":"start the \"meat\" of the poncho."},"802":{"dur":5,"text":"and really, things stay the same - they don't\nchange much from the neck border down to the"},"808":{"dur":1,"text":"bottom of the poncho."},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"there are really just a few things you have\nto learn."},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"and one of those is make 1 stitches."},"814":{"dur":3,"text":"and i know the first question i'm going to\nget from somebody about this pattern is \"can"},"818":{"dur":1,"text":"i use a different increase\"."},"819":{"dur":1,"text":"well, yes you can."},"820":{"dur":4,"text":"but i specifically chose make 1s for this\nbecause they are the most invisible."},"825":{"dur":8,"text":"and using make 1 left and make 1 right stitches\ndoes make - i like the way the mirror increases"},"833":{"dur":1,"text":"look on this."},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"it ends up being part of the desgin."},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"and not just part of the structure of the\nwhole thing."},"839":{"dur":3,"text":"you can use a different increase, and you\nmight even really like the way it looks, with"},"842":{"dur":1,"text":"the yarn that you're using and everythign\nelse."},"844":{"dur":4,"text":"or you could also consider this a really good\nopporutnity to get good at make 1 stitches."},"849":{"dur":5,"text":"let's go ahead and take a look at the little\nsample i have."},"855":{"dur":4,"text":"this is obviously a bulky sample, knit on\nhuge needles."},"859":{"dur":1,"text":"and knit flat and not in the round."},"861":{"dur":4,"text":"but it is an exact copy of what the back of\nthe poncho looks like."},"866":{"dur":4,"text":"right here we have - it's not exact, because\nit's knit flat, so these stitches don't look"},"871":{"dur":3,"text":"quite as nice as they do in the poncho, since\nit's knit in the round."},"874":{"dur":5,"text":"but these are knit through the back loops,\nwhich gives a ridge in the work, and i'll"},"880":{"dur":2,"text":"show you another example here in just a moment."},"882":{"dur":7,"text":"and then the stitches kind of grow out from\nthere at an angle, because of the increases."},"889":{"dur":3,"text":"and every time -well, the pattern, of course,\nspells this all out."},"893":{"dur":10,"text":"let me just get to the spot where we can do\nsome make 1 stitches."},"903":{"dur":5,"text":"the very center back of the poncho is the\nbeginning of the round."},"908":{"dur":5,"text":"and every time you come up, well, follow the\npattern, when you come to an increase row,"},"914":{"dur":6,"text":"you'll knit to one stitch from the marker,\nand we want to do a make 1 right on this side"},"920":{"dur":1,"text":"of the marker."},"921":{"dur":1,"text":"and a make 1 left on this side of the marker."},"923":{"dur":3,"text":"because they lean, and we want it to be decorative."},"926":{"dur":4,"text":"to do a make 1 right, you want to pick up\nthe bar between two stitches."},"931":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's pretty obvious, it's right there."},"933":{"dur":4,"text":"this is bulky yarn, but it's still pretty\nobvious when you're doing it in the poncho"},"937":{"dur":3,"text":"with the size needles and the yarn that we\nhave there."},"940":{"dur":5,"text":"so i'm going to pick this up from back to\nfront wtih the left needle."},"945":{"dur":1,"text":"from back to front."},"947":{"dur":2,"text":"and i actually am more coordinated with my\nright hand."},"949":{"dur":4,"text":"i usually pick it up wtih my left needle,\nand hand it over - backwards!"},"954":{"dur":3,"text":"i pick it up with my RIGHT needle, and hand\nit to my left needle."},"957":{"dur":2,"text":"so that's how it's going to be looped over\nthe needle."},"960":{"dur":3,"text":"we're going to knit this through the front\nloop, the normal way of knitting."},"964":{"dur":1,"text":"which is tricky."},"965":{"dur":4,"text":"make 1 stitches can be tricky because you\nhave to put a twist on the stitch to keep"},"969":{"dur":1,"text":"there from being a hole."},"971":{"dur":3,"text":"so i'm going to knit this through the front\nloop like this."},"975":{"dur":1,"text":"and that is a completed make 1 right."},"977":{"dur":1,"text":"let me show you one more time."},"979":{"dur":4,"text":"make 1 right is picking up the bar between\ntwo stitches from back to front."},"983":{"dur":1,"text":"and then knitting it through the front loop."},"985":{"dur":2,"text":"and one thing to make it easier - two things\nto make it easier."},"988":{"dur":4,"text":"first one is, you can use needles with pretty\nsharp tips that will make it easier to get"},"992":{"dur":1,"text":"the needle in there."},"994":{"dur":5,"text":"or what i do is i use my index finger and\ncreate some slack on that stitch to give my"},"999":{"dur":1,"text":"needle some room."},"1000":{"dur":2,"text":"okay, so that's a make 1 right."},"1003":{"dur":3,"text":"then i'm going to knit this through the back\nloop."},"1006":{"dur":3,"text":"slip the marker, knit the next one through\nthe back loop."},"1010":{"dur":2,"text":"and

through the front loop, which is\ntotally easy, and just slide my needle over"},"1040":{"dur":1,"text":"like that."},"1041":{"dur":3,"text":"but if you have, you can also just create\nsome slack on
