recipe."},"56":{"dur":6,"text":"I don\u2019t even really have a name for it,\nbut it has the traditional beer bread ingredients"},"62":{"dur":2,"text":"that we normally used in the past."},"64":{"dur":3,"text":"I\u2019m adding some dried tomatoes."},"68":{"dur":3,"text":"These are just absolutely wonderful."},"72":{"dur":6,"text":"I\u2019m going to be using a garlic and herb\nfeta cheese, and then a nice little combination"},"79":{"dur":4,"text":"of margarine and basil to give it a little\naccent and a little bit more of a flavor in"},"83":{"dur":1,"text":"there."},"84":{"dur":4,"text":"And that is all going to be blended together\nand cooked in our Big Gas Grill."},"89":{"dur":3,"text":"But first thing I\u2019ve got to do is I need\nto modify this a little bit."},"93":{"dur":5,"text":"I\u2019m going to be putting the beer bread in\nthe cast iron pan."},"98":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is just a basic loaf pan."},"101":{"dur":4,"text":"But if I put it directly on top of the cooking\ngrates on the Big Gas Grill, it\u2019s going"},"105":{"dur":3,"text":"to top out and I\u2019m afraid the beer bread\u2019s\ngoing to rise up to where it\u2019s going to"},"108":{"dur":4,"text":"hit the top of the grill cover."},"112":{"dur":3,"text":"So what I\u2019m going to do is I\u2019m going to\ntake one of the grates out and then I\u2019m"},"116":{"dur":3,"text":"going to drop the other one sideways down\nlow, so it\u2019s going to give me plenty of"},"119":{"dur":1,"text":"clearance in there."},"120":{"dur":1,"text":"So watch how I do that."},"122":{"dur":3,"text":"So let me show you what I\u2019m talking about."},"125":{"dur":5,"text":"And you can see the grates are right at the\ntop of the bottom of the grill box and if"},"131":{"dur":6,"text":"we put this pan right in the centre, there\u2019s\nvery little clearance in there."},"138":{"dur":5,"text":"I know you can\u2019t see that, but there\u2019s\nmaybe 1\/2 an inch or so clearance from the"},"143":{"dur":3,"text":"top of the bread pan to the hood of the grill."},"147":{"dur":2,"text":"So what I\u2019m going to do is I\u2019m going to\ntake one of these out."},"150":{"dur":3,"text":"Now I\u2019ve been cooking on mine a lot, so\nthey\u2019re a little dirty."},"153":{"dur":2,"text":"Get some nice gloves."},"155":{"dur":11,"text":"And what we\u2019ll do is we\u2019ll very gently\nremove one of these and we\u2019ll set it down"},"167":{"dur":1,"text":"here."},"168":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is all my cooking goodness."},"171":{"dur":6,"text":"And I think what I\u2019ll do is I\u2019ll drop\nthis down lower and what that\u2019s going to"},"178":{"dur":7,"text":"do is give me probably another inch of clearance\nand I think that\u2019s going to be enough."},"185":{"dur":4,"text":"So having done that, we\u2019re going to get\nthis preheated."},"189":{"dur":3,"text":"I\u2019m going to turn my burner on high."},"193":{"dur":3,"text":"That one\u2019s going."},"197":{"dur":6,"text":"And I\u2019m going to go between the medium and\nthe low setting on this."},"204":{"dur":5,"text":"I\u2019m going to get this up at about 325 degrees."},"209":{"dur":1,"text":"Around that range is what I\u2019m going to try\nto bake at."},"211":{"dur":4,"text":"So we\u2019ll preheat that while we\u2019re mixing\nup our bread recipe."},"215":{"dur":7,"text":"Okay, our basic beer bread recipe, if you\nremember, 3 cups of self-rising flour, 3 tablespoons"},"223":{"dur":4,"text":"of sugar and 1 teaspoon of salt and a can\nof very inexpensive beer."},"227":{"dur":3,"text":"Try different types of beers, they all add\ndifferent flavors and such."},"231":{"dur":4,"text":"This particular beer I\u2019m using right here\ngives me a little more hoppiness to it."},"236":{"dur":3,"text":"If you\u2019re a beer drinker, you know what\nI\u2019m talking about, but it\u2019s just a little"},"239":{"dur":1,"text":"bit of a different taste."},"240":{"dur":1,"text":"Didn\u2019t say it\u2019s bad."},"242":{"dur":1,"text":"Didn\u2019t say it\u2019s good."},"243":{"dur":1,"text":"It\u2019s just different."},"244":{"dur":4,"text":"And you need to experiment with brands that\nyou like because they all add a little different"},"249":{"dur":1,"text":"flavor."},"250":{"dur":1,"text":"But I think this is going to be really, really,\ngood."},"251":{"dur":5,"text":"So the first thing we\u2019re going to mix up\nour few dry ingredients and this is about"},"257":{"dur":7,"text":"a teaspoon of dried basil and dried margarine."},"264":{"dur":4,"text":"And if I didn\u2019t say that right, that\u2019s\nbecause it\u2019s me."},"268":{"dur":4,"text":"So, you know, wonderful, wonderful flavor\nhere."},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is dried, you could certainly use\nfresh."},"275":{"dur":1,"text":"In fact, I totally encourage it."},"277":{"dur":6,"text":"I have about a cup of these real nice dried\ntomatoes and they are very pungent, but it\u2019s"},"284":{"dur":4,"text":"going to add some wonderful color and I think\nsome really good flavor to them."},"288":{"dur":5,"text":"And these were already julienned in the little\nbag that I bought them in."},"293":{"dur":6,"text":"So we\u2019ll get that mixed in there."},"300":{"dur":9,"text":"And the cheese that I picked up, just at the\nlocal grocery, it is a basil--excuse me--a"},"309":{"dur":3,"text":"garlic herbed feta cheese."},"312":{"dur":3,"text":"And you know that I like feta a lot."},"316":{"dur":5,"text":"And so I think this is going to work out really,\nreally, nice."},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you haven\u2019t figured it out yet, I\u2019ve\nyet to make this bread."},"324":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is just off the top of my head, just\nanother idea I had."},"328":{"dur":6,"text":"If you buy the cheese in the block, it crumbles\nup larger chunks which I think adds some more"},"335":{"dur":3,"text":"flavor than if you were to buy it already\npre-crumbled."},"339":{"dur":5,"text":"That typically is very, very, tiny pieces\nand with anything that I cook in it\u2019s got"},"345":{"dur":1,"text":"to be chunky."},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"I want to taste everything."},"348":{"dur":6,"text":"And this is about I think it was a 1\/2 a pound,\nwhich may or may not be overkill."},"354":{"dur":7,"text":"And, yeah, 1\/2 a pound."},"362":{"dur":6,"text":"Let\u2019s mix this up here."},"368":{"dur":9,"text":"And I\u2019ve already mixed up the sugar and\nthe salt in with the self-rising flour, so"},"377":{"dur":3,"text":"that\u2019s ready to go there."},"380":{"dur":7,"text":"Now the big secret with beer bread is once\nwe add the beer that we do not over mix."},"388":{"dur":3,"text":"A couple people have written me back and said,\n\u201cOh, my beer bread just didn\u2019t rise."},"392":{"dur":1,"text":"It didn\u2019t do what it was supposed to do."},"394":{"dur":1,"text":"I was really disappointed.\u201d"},"396":{"dur":6,"text":"And they were out there really pretty much\nworking it like a traditional beer and it\u2019s"},"402":{"dur":1,"text":"not."},"403":{"dur":7,"text":"You just want to get the ingredients mixed\nup and a very wet solution and it plops into"},"411":{"dur":2,"text":"your pan."},"414":{"dur":10,"text":"I always pour about 3\/4 of my beer in to start\nwith."},"424":{"dur":12,"text":"And you can see that\u2019s not enough but I\nfind that it\u2019s better to go a little less"},"437":{"dur":1,"text":"than a little too much."},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"I don\u2019t want it to pour out of my bowl."},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"I want it to glop."},"442":{"dur":4,"text":"You can imagine what a glop is."},"447":{"dur":6,"text":"It\u2019s almost there."},"453":{"dur":4,"text":"Now say if you only had one beer and you ran\nout of beer, you could add a little bit of"},"458":{"dur":9,"text":"water, it\u2019s not going to hurt, but we\u2019re\ngetting all of our yeast from the beer and"},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"it\u2019s getting gloppy."},"470":{"dur":8,"text":"I\u2019m going to add the rest of the beer and\nI think it should turn out just to be perfect."},"478":{"dur":10,"text":"Also, been asked whether you could use a non-alcoholic\nbeer?"},"488":{"dur":1,"text":"I think so."},"489":{"dur":5,"text":"I haven\u2019t tried it yet and I definitely\nneed to add that to my recipe to see how that"},"494":{"dur":7,"text":"works, but really we\u2019re not in this for\nthe alcohol content, we\u2019re in it for the"},"502":{"dur":1,"text":"yeast factor."},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, now you can see how that looks."},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"That\u2019s really gloppy."},"508":{"dur":3,"text":"I\u2019ve already pre-greased my cast iron pan."},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"This is from Camp Chef."},"514":{"dur":7,"text":"This is one of their Sante line and, as you\nknow, Camp Chef is one of my sponsors."},"521":{"dur":8,"text":"And I\u2019m just going to put a little bit of\ncornmeal on the bottom of this just to give"},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"me a little bit better release."},"531":{"dur":6,"text":"And then all we\u2019re going to do is plop this\nin the pan."},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"And plop."},"540":{"dur":5,"text":"I didn\u2019t overwork it."},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"I just stirred it up enough to mix it up."},"548":{"dur":8,"text":"I\u2019m going to very roughly place it in there,\nshape it, if you will."},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"And then that\u2019s it."},"558":{"dur":6,"text":"I expect I\u2019m going to get a couple inches\nof rise out of that and if I don\u2019t, I\u2019m"},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"in trouble, but that should be the case."},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"And that\u2019s it, that\u2019s just another beer\nbread."},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"You can see by looking at it it\u2019s already\ngot some nice color to it."},"574":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think we\u2019re going to have a really\ngood one this time."},"577":{"dur":5,"text":"So my Camp Chef stove is right at 350."},"583":{"dur":4,"text":"I think we\u2019re going to drop it in there."},"588":{"dur":4,"text":"With the big gas grill we\u2019re going to control\nthe heat in two ways."},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"I\u2019m going to be adjusting the burners down\nbelow."},"596":{"dur":5,"text":"Definitely probably getting as it heats up\nmore and more closer to the low setting and"},"601":{"dur":6,"text":"then I\u2019ll also be adjusting the vent that\u2019s\nup on the top to control the heat."},"608":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, keep in mind that this vent gets really\nhot, so you don\u2019t want to just touch it"},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"with your bare hands."},"613":{"dur":3,"text":"And, you know, I always keep my Dutch oven\ngloves around."},"617":{"dur":6,"text":"And opening it up lets more heat out and I\nthink we\u2019re going to get-- in fact, I know"},"624":{"dur":4,"text":"we\u2019re going to get some additional flavor\non our bread because of all the stuff that"},"628":{"dur":3,"text":"I left in the bottom of this grill box from\nour previous meals."},"632":{"dur":3,"text":"We\u2019ll just call this barbecue beer bread."},"635":{"dur":6,"text":"Alright, let\u2019s drop this in there."},"642":{"dur":9,"text":"Okay, that\u2019s going to give me plenty of\nheight."},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"I\u2019ve turned these all the way down to low."},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"I\u2019m going to monitor the temperature here."},"657":{"dur":4,"text":"I\u2019m going to keep my eye on it the whole\ntime during the cooking process."},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"This is going to take 40-45 minutes."},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"It could be just a little bit less, but I\u2019m\nlooking at 45 minutes."},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"While this is cooking, we\u2019re making our\nsplit pea soup."},"670":{"dur":4,"text":"We\u2019re calling this Nancy\u2019s Split Pea Soup."},"675":{"dur":5,"text":"This recipe came from a friend of mine, Nancy\nSmith and Bryan, apparently this recipe was"},"680":{"dur":5,"text":"from her mom who found it in a magazine many\nyears ago."},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"So I don\u2019t know where this recipe originated."},"688":{"dur":6,"text":"I\u2019ve altered it slightly, just a little\nbit, but the ingredients it\u2019s really once"},"695":{"dur":3,"text":"you\u2019ve prepped a few things it\u2019s dump\nin a pot and cook it."},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"It is so simple."},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"And it\u2019s just rich and full and just absolutely\nwonderful."},"703":{"dur":7,"text":"I\u2019m going to be using a 12 inch Camp Chef\nDutch Oven on my Camp Chef Big Gas Grill."},"711":{"dur":3,"text":"The ingredients that are in this are about\n1 cup of onion."},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"It\u2019s actually half a small onion."},"717":{"dur":1,"text":"I\u2019ve got half a large onion."},"719":{"dur":1,"text":"I add a little bit more."},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"A cup of chopped celery."},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"One chopped garlic, I used 1."},"728":{"dur":1,"text":"Tablespoon of butter."},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"The recipe calls for bacon."},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"I like ham in mine, so I put some ham chunks."},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"I probably have roughly a cup there."},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"2 large carrots."},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"This is a bunch of little carrots."},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"Roughly a cup."},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"Let\u2019s see here."},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"A teaspoon of sugar."},"749":{"dur":7,"text":"Sorry, I got to read this I don\u2019t have it\nmemorized, so this is allspice."},"757":{"dur":3,"text":"Now it calls for whole allspice cloves, I\ndon\u2019t have any."},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"Or you can use a dash of allspice."},"764":{"dur":1,"text":"What\u2019s a dash?"},"765":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe 1\/8th of a teaspoon."},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"That\u2019s about all that\u2019s there."},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"Couple bay leaves."},"770":{"dur":3,"text":"We\u2019re going to take those out at the end."},"773":{"dur":3,"text":"1\/4 teaspoon of pepper."},"776":{"dur":5,"text":"A 1\/8th of a cup of barley."},"782":{"dur":5,"text":"And then 1 cup of dried split peas."},"788":{"dur":1,"text":"That\u2019s really it."},"790":{"dur":4,"text":"It\u2019s that-- oh, and 6 cups of chicken broth."},"794":{"dur":2,"text":"And that\u2019s just 1 large can about 49 ounces."},"797":{"dur":1,"text":"So that\u2019s it."},"798":{"dur":3,"text":"What I need to do now is I\u2019m going heat\nup my Dutch oven."},"802":{"dur":4,"text":"A couple of thoughts here on the Dutch oven,\nI\u2019m putting mine directly over the flame,"},"806":{"dur":1,"text":"so that means I\u2019ve got to be careful."},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"I\u2019d keep it turned down or I\u2019m going to\nbe scoring the bottom."},"810":{"dur":3,"text":"They make what\u2019s called a diffuser plate,\nwhich is a metal plate that can go between"},"814":{"dur":2,"text":"a gas burner and your Dutch oven."},"816":{"dur":3,"text":"I don\u2019t have one, so I\u2019m kind of going\nto play with it."},"819":{"dur":3,"text":"I originally thought well, I\u2019ll just put\nthe lid under there and then I\u2019ll heat the"},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"lid and I\u2019ll heat the pot, and you know\nwhat, I\u2019m just going to give this a shot"},"825":{"dur":1,"text":"right under the burner."},"827":{"dur":3,"text":"I\u2019m going to have to keep it down on low\nI\u2019m sure."},"830":{"dur":4,"text":"But this recipe typically takes about 2 hours\nto cook and I\u2019m going to speed a little"},"835":{"dur":4,"text":"bit of it up because I\u2019m going to cook in\nsome butter, my celery, and my onions, and"},"839":{"dur":2,"text":"my carrots and do a little precooking on that."},"841":{"dur":1,"text":"Just for a few minutes to get those things\ngoing."},"843":{"dur":3,"text":"Then we\u2019ll dump everything in there and\nthen we\u2019re going to let it simmer and cook"},"846":{"dur":4,"text":"and probably about an hour I\u2019m going to\nhave this bad boy ready, I\u2019m hoping, it"},"851":{"dur":1,"text":"might take longer."},"852":{"dur":1,"text":"So hang in there."},"853":{"dur":1,"text":"Let\u2019s see what we\u2019re going to do."},"855":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay, let\u2019s get this burner going."},"856":{"dur":1,"text":"I\u2019m going to take my lid off."},"858":{"dur":2,"text":"It\u2019s actually already hot from the sun."},"861":{"dur":2,"text":"And I\u2019m going to just put it over here."},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"And it is getting really hot."},"865":{"dur":6,"text":"So to turn this, just push to turn and you\nturn your starter."},"871":{"dur":1,"text":"And, boom, that\u2019s it."},"872":{"dur":2,"text":"Now I\u2019m going to get this way down on low."},"874":{"dur":2,"text":"And I\u2019ll play with it as we go."},"877":{"dur":3,"text":"I may want it higher, may want it lower."},"880":{"dur":2,"text":"I got to keep an eye on it is basically what\nI\u2019m telling you."},"882":{"dur":5,"text":"This traditionally maybe you could put it\nin a crock pot and just walk away from it,"},"888":{"dur":3,"text":"but I\u2019m not thinking I\u2019m going to have\nthat luxury because I got to monitor the bread,"},"891":{"dur":4,"text":"monitor the soup, so we\u2019re going to be keeping\na close eye on it this time."},"896":{"dur":9,"text":"Start out with our butter."},"905":{"dur":11,"text":"And then I\u2019m going to add my onions, my\ncelery and my carrots."},"917":{"dur":20,"text":"Okay, we\u2019ll get those going."},"938":{"dur":4,"text":"And I\u2019m just going to saut\u00e9 them until\nI get some color out of them, soften them"},"942":{"dur":3,"text":"up a bit and speed up the process."},"945":{"dur":3,"text":"And I\u2019ll be right back after I\u2019m done\ndoing that."},"948":{"dur":2,"text":"So we\u2019ve been saut\u00e9ing it a little bit."},"951":{"dur":2,"text":"The vegetables are kind of softened."},"954":{"dur":1,"text":"Got some color on the onions."},"955":{"dur":4,"text":"Now we\u2019re going to add all the dry ingredients\nstarting with the garlic because I want to"},"959":{"dur":5,"text":"smell that first."},"965":{"dur":7,"text":"Okay, that was 2 cloves of garlic."},"973":{"dur":4,"text":"Recipe only calls for one but got to kick\nit up a bit."},"977":{"dur":3,"text":"Let\u2019s get our ham in there."},"980":{"dur":2,"text":"And I just chunked this up."},"983":{"dur":4,"text":"You can dice it, you can mince it, whatever\nyou want to do, but I just chunked it up."},"987":{"dur":3,"text":"Some nice smoked ham."},"990":{"dur":3,"text":"And our pepper."},"993":{"dur":10,"text":"And a dash of allspice."},"1004":{"dur":5,"text":"I believe this was a teaspoon of sugar."},"1009":{"dur":5,"text":"1\/8th of a cup of dry barley."},"1014":{"dur":6,"text":"And a cup of our beans."},"1021":{"dur":8,"text":"2 bay leaves."},"1030":{"dur":4,"text":"Does call for one,

wonderful."},"1040":{"dur":4,"text":"But remember to take it out when you\u2019re\ndone cooking unless you like to eat it."},"1044":{"dur":3,"text":"I imagine some people are just going to chow\nthat down and not care about it, but I\u2019m"},"1047":{"dur":4,"text":"not too big of a fan of old dried out leaves\nin my soup."},"1052":{"dur":4,"text":"Let\u2019s get this mixed up."},"1057":{"dur":5,"text":"Oh, boy."},"1062":{"dur":4,"text":"That already smells incredible."},"1067":{"dur":10,"text":"So let\u2019s take our 6 cups of stock."},"1077":{"dur":11,"text":"Get that mixed up."},"1089":{"dur":11,"text":"What I\u2019m going to do is I\u2019m going to bring\nthis to a boil and once we get it up to boil"},"1101":{"dur":7,"text":"we\u2019re going to turn it down to a

do it with the lid on."},"1113":{"dur":3,"text":"I totally think it could be done with the\nlid off, in fact, I\u2019ve done it many times"},"1117":{"dur":5,"text":"with the lid off, but I got a lot

do."},"1126":{"dur":1,"text":"We got a ways to go."},"1127":{"dur":1,"text":"I\u2019m sure the bread\u2019s coming up nicely."},"1129":{"dur":2,"text":"It\u2019s been in there for a little bit now."},"1132":{"dur":3,"text":"We\u2019ll take a sneak peek about halfway through,\nsee how we\u2019re doing."},"1135":{"dur":2,"text":"Let\u2019s take a look at our beer bread."},"1138":{"dur":3,"text":"It should be done."},"1141":{"dur":2,"text":"Hmm."},"1144":{"dur":4,"text":"That looks fantastic."},"1148":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay, this is really

there."},"1169":{"dur":6,"text":"It should just roll out and hopefully we didn\u2019t\nburn the bottom."},"1175":{"dur":6,"text":"Always remember the cast iron is very hot."},"1181":{"dur":11,"text":"This should, in theory, just come out like\nso."},"1193":{"dur":4,"text":"Nice thump on the bottom."},"1197":{"dur":7,"text":"Browned nicely."},"1205":{"dur":2,"text":"Let that cool off while we finish cooking\nup our soup."},"1207":{"dur":8,"text":"Now, you heard me talking about these before\nand this is your lid trivet."},"1215":{"dur":6,"text":"This is what\u2019s going to go on the ground\nso that our lid does not go on the ground."},"1222":{"dur":1,"text":"Works really well."},"1224":{"dur":2,"text":"Keeps all the bugs and critters off of there."},"1226":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, wow, look at that."},"1230":{"dur":4,"text":"That\u2019s starting to thicken up."},"1235":{"dur":4,"text":"And getting just where we want it."},"1240":{"dur":7,"text":"A little something floating in there; let\nme get that out real quick."},"1248":{"dur":2,"text":"And that is thickening up very nicely."},"1250":{"dur":6,"text":"I would say we probably have, maybe, 30 minutes\nleft to go."},"1257":{"dur":3,"text":"Put that lid back on."},"1261":{"dur":9,"text":"Get it back up to a nice boil."},"1271":{"dur":2,"text":"We got split pea soup coming."},"1273":{"dur":2,"text":"The bread is done."},"1275":{"dur":5,"text":"It\u2019s been cooking, it cooked for 45-50 minutes\nroughly around there."},"1281":{"dur":5,"text":"The soup\u2019s ready to pull off and that is\nabsolutely almost done now."},"1286":{"dur":5,"text":"We\u2019ll do the final steps on all this and\nhopefully you can see in my minimal light"},"1292":{"dur":2,"text":"here, but I think we got something good going\non."},"1295":{"dur":4,"text":"So I\u2019m going to put a little paper towels\ndown here because I\u2019m going to set the Dutch"},"1300":{"dur":4,"text":"oven on top of my lid and it\u2019s going to\nhave a lot of moisture and stuff, so I\u2019m"},"1305":{"dur":12,"text":"going to try to pick up some of that without\nsoaking up our tablecloth."},"1317":{"dur":5,"text":"Reason I\u2019m putting the lid down first is\nsimply to protect my table surface."},"1323":{"dur":10,"text":"This is not nearly as hot as the Dutch oven\nitself."},"1333":{"dur":14,"text":"Now you can tell when this is done by the\nsimple fact that the peas have basically exploded,"},"1347":{"dur":3,"text":"everything is soft and tender."},"1351":{"dur":5,"text":"So what we need to do now, I need to mush\nthis up."},"1357":{"dur":6,"text":"And as I go through there I\u2019ll find my bay\nleaves and get them out."},"1363":{"dur":3,"text":"Now you could take this out and run it through\na blender if you want."},"1367":{"dur":2,"text":"There\u2019s nothing wrong with that."},"1369":{"dur":5,"text":"The only reason I don\u2019t do it in a blender\nis because I like it a little bit chunky."},"1375":{"dur":4,"text":"I don\u2019t want a creamy pea soup, if you will."},"1380":{"dur":4,"text":"I really like something I can taste the bits\nand pieces."},"1385":{"dur":3,"text":"So I just use a regular potato masher and\nthen when you\u2019re out camping this makes"},"1389":{"dur":5,"text":"it even easier to do this way because you\ndon\u2019t have to worry about getting one of"},"1395":{"dur":4,"text":"those expensive gas powered blenders."},"1399":{"dur":9,"text":"And just simply mix this up as much as you\nlike and you\u2019ll see the barley in there,"},"1408":{"dur":4,"text":"little pieces that look like rice."},"1412":{"dur":5,"text":"And this is getting pretty darn close to where\nI like it."},"1417":{"dur":7,"text":"And, oh, boy this sure smells just wonderful."},"1425":{"dur":2,"text":"Here\u2019s that other bay leaf."},"1427":{"dur":4,"text":"I knew that would show up sooner or later."},"1432":{"dur":4,"text":"And, for me, that\u2019s a good consistency."},"1436":{"dur":2,"text":"I like that."},"1439":{"dur":2,"text":"And let\u2019s see here, we\u2019ve got to slice\nup our bread."},"1442":{"dur":2,"text":"So let me move a couple of things around here."},"1445":{"dur":5,"text":"Been letting it cool off on a trivet."},"1450":{"dur":10,"text":"And let\u2019s see if we can do some rearranging\nreal quick here."},"1461":{"dur":6,"text":"Okay, soup to the side."},"1467":{"dur":6,"text":"Get our bread out and cut."},"1474":{"dur":3,"text":"See how we did there."},"1477":{"dur":9,"text":"Mm, I\u2019m thinking this is going to be just\nperfect."},"1486":{"dur":3,"text":"So crisp, crispy, crunchy?"},"1490":{"dur":5,"text":"Oh, yeah, got some nice color there."},"1496":{"dur":4,"text":"Those tomatoes are really pungent."},"1500":{"dur":12,"text":"And look at that."},"1513":{"dur":5,"text":"I would say that is a pretty darned decent\nloaf of bread there."},"1519":{"dur":2,"text":"Our typical 10,000 flies."},"1522":{"dur":10,"text":"Let\u2019s serve some of this up and we\u2019ll\ncall it a wrap."},"1532":{"dur":5,"text":"Nancy\u2019s Split Pea

40 really great wonderful comments\non there."},"1578":{"dur":3,"text":"I need 100, helps the show."},"1582":{"dur":8,"text":"Make sure above all else you go and say thank\nyou to my sponsors, Island
