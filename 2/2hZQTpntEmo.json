{"0":{"dur":4,"text":"Eric, thank you very much for coming over\nhere today to AEI to record this video."},"5":{"dur":3,"text":"You and I have put a lot of work in over the\nlast couple of years on our corporate tax"},"8":{"dur":3,"text":"reform project, so I think it's really great\nthat we have an opportunity to try to explain"},"12":{"dur":2,"text":"this to a general audience."},"15":{"dur":4,"text":"We know that corporate income tax is seriously\nflawed and that some of the reforms out there"},"19":{"dur":4,"text":"that have been put forward are really not\nup to the job of fixing the fundamental problems."},"23":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I'm really happy that you and I were\nable to put together a plan that's a little"},"27":{"dur":3,"text":"bit more fundamental and maybe gets at some\nof those basic flaws."},"30":{"dur":4,"text":"Now this is a complicated topic, so we're\ngoing to be trying to do this in a series of"},"35":{"dur":4,"text":"stages here today, exploring different aspects\nof the topic as we go along."},"40":{"dur":4,"text":"We're first going to start with a simple description\nof how the corporate income tax works today"},"44":{"dur":3,"text":"and then lay out what we see as being its\nmost basic flaws."},"47":{"dur":3,"text":"Then we'll look at some of the other proposals\nthat have been put forward to try to reform"},"51":{"dur":5,"text":"the system and show that while some of them\nhave some merit, they really aren't enough"},"56":{"dur":3,"text":"to fix the underlying problems that we've\nidentified."},"59":{"dur":4,"text":"So then we'll turn to the proposal that you\nand I worked so hard on, set forth some of"},"63":{"dur":4,"text":"its provisions and then describe why we think\nit does fix those flaws and the economic benefits"},"68":{"dur":2,"text":"that it will bring to the United States."},"70":{"dur":3,"text":"And then try to say a few words about what\nthe prospects might be for Congress and the"},"74":{"dur":4,"text":"president to actually do something, both in\nthe short run and in the long run."},"79":{"dur":3,"text":"So I guess we should start by just explaining\nhow the corporate income tax works today."},"82":{"dur":2,"text":"Eric: Okay, thank you, Alan."},"84":{"dur":2,"text":"It's been a great pleasure for me to work\non this project."},"87":{"dur":7,"text":"I've learned a lot and I think it's very important that the public understand what the problems are"},"94":{"dur":6,"text":"It's one of the biggest issues in our tax\nsystem now and one of the least well understood,"},"101":{"dur":1,"text":"so we'll give it a go."},"102":{"dur":5,"text":"So I'll first start by talking about what\nthe corporate tax is."},"107":{"dur":5,"text":"Corporate income tax is the third largest\nrevenue source in our federal tax system."},"113":{"dur":7,"text":"It raises a little over 10% of federal revenues,\nabout 2% of gross domestic product and it"},"120":{"dur":3,"text":"is a tax on the profits of corporations, as\nyou could imagine."},"123":{"dur":6,"text":"Profits are just simply, you get your revenues\nfrom all your sales and you deduct your costs"},"130":{"dur":2,"text":"and the difference is your profit."},"132":{"dur":6,"text":"Now the profit, the costs include things like\nwages you pay to your employees, purchases"},"138":{"dur":8,"text":"from other firms, interest that you pay to\nyour creditors and the cost of your equipment,"},"147":{"dur":5,"text":"which you get to write off over time...we\nwill discuss that a little further...but you"},"152":{"dur":6,"text":"get to deduct over time the cost of the equipment\nand buildings you buy as they wear out."},"158":{"dur":7,"text":"The one thing that is not deductible from\nyour revenues is the payments you make to"},"165":{"dur":3,"text":"your shareholders, to your owners, the dividends\nyou pay to your shareholders."},"169":{"dur":6,"text":"The shareholders pay tax and for all these\nother sources of income, the wages you pay"},"176":{"dur":5,"text":"for the workers, the taxes paid by the workers\nunder the individual income tax, your creditors"},"182":{"dur":5,"text":"pay tax on their interest under the individual\nincome tax and your shareholders pay tax on"},"187":{"dur":3,"text":"their dividends under the individual income\ntax."},"191":{"dur":4,"text":"So what you have is what's called the double\ntaxation of corporate dividends."},"195":{"dur":5,"text":"The revenue is taxed first at the corporate\nlevel and then it's taxed again when it's"},"201":{"dur":3,"text":"paid out to shareholders as dividends."},"205":{"dur":3,"text":"Alan: The capital gains are double taxed too\nreally."},"208":{"dur":4,"text":"Eric: That's correct, although they get to\nbe deferred until the gains are realized,"},"213":{"dur":3,"text":"something we will talk about a little bit\nlater."},"217":{"dur":3,"text":"Eric: So this is the basic structure of the\ncorporate tax."},"220":{"dur":2,"text":"The top rate on corporate income is a graduated\nrate."},"223":{"dur":2,"text":"The top rate is 35%."},"225":{"dur":6,"text":"Most corporate income comes from large corporations\nand most of it is paid at the top federal"},"232":{"dur":1,"text":"rate of 35%."},"234":{"dur":6,"text":"The states also tax corporate profits and\ntheir rates average a little over 6%, so when"},"240":{"dur":6,"text":"you take into account the interaction of the\ntwo, the average rate is about 39% on corporate profit."},"247":{"dur":7,"text":"However, corporations don't actually pay 39%\non their profits because of certain tax preferences"},"255":{"dur":2,"text":"and, Alan, your turn to talk about that."},"258":{"dur":3,"text":"Alan: Sure, yeah, so the corporate income\ntax does have a lot of provisions in there"},"261":{"dur":2,"text":"that offer companies a way to reduce their\ntaxes."},"264":{"dur":4,"text":"For example, there are special credits for\ndifferent types of activities, such as research"},"268":{"dur":4,"text":"and development expenditures that the company\nmay make and preferences for certain types"},"273":{"dur":1,"text":"of energy."},"274":{"dur":5,"text":"Also, Eric, you mentioned the depreciation\nthat can be claimed on equipment and structures"},"279":{"dur":4,"text":"and other things the business uses, how you\nwrite those off over time as they wear out,"},"284":{"dur":6,"text":"but in fact, the preference of the tax code\nis that you can write a lot of those off faster"},"290":{"dur":4,"text":"than they actually wear out and so that accelerated\ndepreciation is another tax preference that"},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"allows companies to reduce their tax liabilities."},"298":{"dur":2,"text":"Now those preferences are all available to\ncorporations that pay the corporate income"},"301":{"dur":4,"text":"tax, but they're also actually available to\nother businesses that don't pay the corporate"},"305":{"dur":1,"text":"income tax."},"306":{"dur":1,"text":"The pass-through businesses."},"307":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe you could talk a bit about pass-throughs."},"308":{"dur":3,"text":"Eric: So maybe I should interject a little\nbit about the pass-through businesses, because"},"312":{"dur":7,"text":"most businesses in the United States are not,\nover 90% are not organized as taxable corporations."},"319":{"dur":5,"text":"They're taxed as so-called pass-throughs,\nwhich means instead of the profits being taxed"},"324":{"dur":5,"text":"to the business, the profits are allocated\nto the shareholders, the owners, the partners"},"330":{"dur":5,"text":"in proportion to their ownership and they\npay individual income tax on that income."},"335":{"dur":8,"text":"Pass-throughs account for about 40% of revenues\nof U.S. businesses and about 60% of net profits."},"344":{"dur":4,"text":"Pass-throughs are very important and they've\nbecome increasingly important."},"349":{"dur":1,"text":"Now what are pass-throughs?"},"351":{"dur":3,"text":"People own their own businesses, they pay\ntax as an individual."},"354":{"dur":6,"text":"People form partnerships with other people\nand there are what are called Subchapter S"},"360":{"dur":6,"text":"Corporations under a certain chapter, Subchapter\nS of the Internal Revenue Code, and these"},"366":{"dur":4,"text":"corporations are allowed to be taxed, if\nthey meet certain tests...are allowed to be"},"371":{"dur":3,"text":"taxed as pass-throughs as well, so they do\nnot pay the corporate income tax."},"375":{"dur":9,"text":"Now when you look at the treatment of pass-throughs,\nthe benefit they have is they do not have"},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"to pay two levels of tax."},"387":{"dur":4,"text":"The payment of distribution of profits has\nno tax consequences."},"392":{"dur":5,"text":"All the profits are taxed once, whether they're\ndistributed or retained in the business."},"397":{"dur":5,"text":"Alan: So that's I think a overview of how\nthe corporate income tax and the taxation"},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"of pass-through businesses works."},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"There is..."},"405":{"dur":6,"text":"Eric: I did want to add one thing there also\nthat the advantage of being a corporation"},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"used to be that you had limited liability."},"415":{"dur":5,"text":"That is, the owners of the corporation were\nnot liable for anything beyond their investment"},"420":{"dur":3,"text":"in the corporation and that was not true for\npass-throughs."},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"However now we have more and more forms of\npass-throughs."},"427":{"dur":4,"text":"The S Corporations are one type, what's called\nlimited liability partnerships are another"},"432":{"dur":7,"text":"type, where there is the same feature of limited\nliability for the owners as for the owners"},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"of corporate shares."},"441":{"dur":6,"text":"So that's meant the advantage of being organized\nas a corporation is much less than it used to be."},"447":{"dur":3,"text":"Alan: It really does raise the question of\nwhy corporations are being singled out for"},"450":{"dur":1,"text":"that double taxation."},"452":{"dur":4,"text":"Maybe you should say a word, Eric, about how\nthe corporate income tax works in the open"},"456":{"dur":4,"text":"economy because that's important to why we\ndecided to pursue this reform."},"461":{"dur":5,"text":"Eric: Right, and so this is a increasing feature\nof the world economy."},"466":{"dur":1,"text":"It's become more globalized."},"468":{"dur":4,"text":"U.S. businesses have become more globalized\nand businesses that have started in other"},"473":{"dur":3,"text":"countries have become more important in the\nglobal economy."},"476":{"dur":6,"text":"So we have a situation today in which most\nof the largest corporations are global and multinational."},"483":{"dur":1,"text":"What does that mean?"},"484":{"dur":7,"text":"It means their workers, their employees, their\nproduction, is carried out in locations all"},"491":{"dur":1,"text":"over the world."},"492":{"dur":4,"text":"They source certain components in Brazil,\ncertain components in France, certain components"},"497":{"dur":4,"text":"in the United States, certain components in\nChina, everywhere."},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"The second feature of globalization is sales."},"505":{"dur":4,"text":"They sell in markets throughout the world\nand foreign markets have become increasingly"},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"important to U.S. corporations."},"512":{"dur":5,"text":"The third feature that's really important\nis shareholders."},"518":{"dur":6,"text":"Now you can buy shares in foreign corporations\nas well as U.S. corporations and U.S. corporations"},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"are marketing their shares to foreign investors."},"527":{"dur":6,"text":"The investors come from all over the world\nand even the R&D, even the headquarters functions,"},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"even central management, is becoming more\ndecentralized."},"538":{"dur":7,"text":"So in what sense is a company a U.S. company\nother than historically they started in the U.S.?"},"545":{"dur":6,"text":"Well, the way we define a U.S. corporation\nis something, a company that has a charter"},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"in the U.S."},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"It has been incorporated formally."},"554":{"dur":3,"text":"It has a piece of paper that says it's a U.S.\ncompany."},"558":{"dur":7,"text":"That's all what that means, but these multinational\ngroups are organized into separate corporations"},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"in all these different countries."},"568":{"dur":4,"text":"The charter is really where the parent corporation,\nthe one that's the head of the whole multinational"},"573":{"dur":3,"text":"group, is so-called resident."},"576":{"dur":7,"text":"U.S. is probably one of the only remaining\nlarge countries which taxes its resident corporations"},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"on its worldwide income."},"586":{"dur":4,"text":"However, that's a very gross simplification."},"591":{"dur":7,"text":"For two reasons: one, if a U.S. company's\naffiliates in a foreign country pay foreign"},"598":{"dur":6,"text":"income tax to that government, the U.S. will\ngive them a credit against U.S. tax liability"},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"for foreign income taxes paid."},"608":{"dur":6,"text":"The second reason is the profits that they\nearn in foreign countries are not taxable"},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"as they're earned."},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"This is a provision known as deferral."},"618":{"dur":5,"text":"They get to defer profits, any profits that\nare earned overseas that are reinvested, get"},"623":{"dur":6,"text":"to be deferred until they are paid back to\nthe U.S. in the form of a dividend."},"630":{"dur":8,"text":"That has a tremendous effect in reducing the\ntax on income in low tax foreign countries,"},"638":{"dur":5,"text":"way below the tax that's paid if those same\nprofits were earned in the United States."},"643":{"dur":4,"text":"Alan: There is still a significant difference\nthough between the U.S. chartered companies"},"648":{"dur":3,"text":"and the foreign chartered companies in the\nforeign chartered companies don't pay any"},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"U.S. tax at all on their overseas profits."},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"Those are really just outside our jurisdiction."},"655":{"dur":1,"text":"Eric: That's correct."},"656":{"dur":5,"text":"Alan: But the U.S. chartered companies, they\ndo pay some U.S. tax on their foreign profits,"},"662":{"dur":3,"text":"but they get those two key benefits that you\nmentioned: the credit for foreign income taxes"},"666":{"dur":3,"text":"and the deferral, which certainly ease that\nburden quite a bit."},"669":{"dur":5,"text":"Eric: The other feature of international tax\nrules that's worth mentioning is each country"},"674":{"dur":6,"text":"gets the first bite of income that's earned\nwithin their borders."},"681":{"dur":4,"text":"So any corporate profits that are earned from\nactivities in the United States, whether by"},"686":{"dur":6,"text":"a U.S. chartered company or a foreign chartered\ncompany, is in theory paying U.S. corporate"},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"income tax."},"694":{"dur":7,"text":"Similarly, any profits in France are paying\nFrench corporate income tax, regardless of"},"702":{"dur":5,"text":"whether it's a U.S. company, a British company,\na Chinese company or anything else."},"708":{"dur":7,"text":"So the first bite comes from the source country\nwhere the profits take place."},"715":{"dur":5,"text":"We'll get a little later soon to the issue\nof, well, where are those profits and how"},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"do you determine where they take place?"},"722":{"dur":4,"text":"Alan: In fact, that's a good segue I guess\nto talking about the real problems that the"},"726":{"dur":1,"text":"corporate income tax has today."},"727":{"dur":4,"text":"Economists have always been somewhat dubious\nabout the corporate income tax and historically"},"732":{"dur":4,"text":"the reason just has been because of some flaws\nthat it has, even in a closed economy."},"736":{"dur":4,"text":"Flaws that continue certainly in an open economy,\nbut that would occur even if it was closed."},"741":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'll just say a word about those quickly\nand then turn it back over to you to discuss"},"744":{"dur":4,"text":"the flaws that particularly arise in an open\neconomy, because that's what really drove"},"749":{"dur":1,"text":"us to this project."},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"But even in a closed economy, corporate income\ntax would be kind of problematic."},"754":{"dur":3,"text":"It has a number of economic distortions where\nit encourages people to do things for tax"},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"reasons that they wouldn't do for good business\nreasons."},"761":{"dur":3,"text":"There's a number of things that could be mentioned,\nbut I'll just focus on two big ones."},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"The distinction between debt and equity and\nthe distinction between corporate and pass-through"},"768":{"dur":1,"text":"businesses."},"770":{"dur":3,"text":"As you've already explained, Eric, the corporations\nare allowed to deduct the interest payments"},"773":{"dur":4,"text":"they make to their bondholders and then the\nbondholders pay taxes only one level of tax,"},"778":{"dur":1,"text":"when the corporation uses debt."},"779":{"dur":3,"text":"But then if they use equity, there's two levels\nof tax, the double taxation you mentioned"},"783":{"dur":5,"text":"earlier where the corporation pays tax and\nthen the individual stockholders pay tax on"},"788":{"dur":1,"text":"their dividends and capital gains."},"790":{"dur":4,"text":"They do get a preferential rate and the capital\ngains tax is deferred until they sell, but"},"794":{"dur":2,"text":"still there's a second level of tax there."},"796":{"dur":4,"text":"And so that artificially encourages companies\nto use debt when there might be good business"},"801":{"dur":3,"text":"reasons to issue stock or equity instead,\nso it would encourage companies to engage"},"804":{"dur":4,"text":"in more borrowing than they otherwise would\ndo and that's been a longstanding distortion"},"809":{"dur":1,"text":"of the corporate income tax."},"810":{"dur":3,"text":"Another distortion is just how you set up\nyour business because the corporate income"},"814":{"dur":4,"text":"tax only does apply to corporations and it\ndoesn't apply to all of those pass-throughs"},"818":{"dur":3,"text":"and so it gives an artificial tax advantage\nto the pass-throughs, causing them to become"},"822":{"dur":5,"text":"a bigger share of the economy and corporations\na smaller share of the economy than your business"},"827":{"dur":1,"text":"logic might otherwise dictate."},"829":{"dur":4,"text":"It's particularly odd to see that because\nas you mentioned, some of the pass-through"},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"businesses actually have characteristics that\nare very similar to corporations in terms"},"837":{"dur":2,"text":"of the liability protections for their owners."},"839":{"dur":5,"text":"And so even when people weren't really worried\nabout international investment and cross border"},"845":{"dur":3,"text":"activity, economists had said these are real\nproblems with the corporate income tax and"},"848":{"dur":3,"text":"it'd be good if a reform could be done that\nwould address them."},"852":{"dur":4,"text":"That's in and of itself, I think, a pretty\ndecent reason to be thinking about corporate"},"856":{"dur":5,"text":"tax reform, but I think it's really overshadowed\nby the bigger problems that are layered on"},"862":{"dur":3,"text":"top of these distortions once you think about\nthe open economy."},"865":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe you can say a bit about that."},"867":{"dur":3,"text":"Eric: Well, I can, but before I do that, I\nwant to ask you one question."},"870":{"dur":1,"text":"Alan: Sure."},"871":{"dur":3,"text":"Eric: And that is, given all the bad things\nyou've described about the corporate income"},"874":{"dur":2,"text":"tax, why don't we just get rid of it?"},"876":{"dur":3,"text":"Alan: Yeah, so there's certainly...it's an\nissue that you and I have certainly wrestled"},"880":{"dur":2,"text":"with and it's an issue economists have long\nwrestled with."},"883":{"dur":6,"text":"There's obviously some popularity from a political\nstandpoint of taxing corporations because"},"889":{"dur":2,"text":"people tend to think nobody's paying that\ntax."},"891":{"dur":1,"text":"That's of course a bad reason."},"892":{"dur":3,"text":"There are some good reasons though why people\nhave been reluctant to just scrap the corporate"},"896":{"dur":1,"text":"income tax."},"897":{"dur":5,"text":"Reasons why you need to think about any action\nthat you take: it does bring in revenue and"},"902":{"dur":3,"text":"also if you're not collecting the tax at the\ncorporate level, you probably do want to make"},"905":{"dur":3,"text":"sure that that income is going to be fully\ntaxed at the shareholder level."},"909":{"dur":3,"text":"Of course, that's the direction our reform\nplan ended up taking."},"912":{"dur":6,"text":"Eric: Okay, so let me go on to the issues\nof international again...we're going back"},"918":{"dur":5,"text":"and forth...but as I said before, we tax companies\non two bases."},"924":{"dur":4,"text":"Where the profits come from and where the\ncompany is resident."},"928":{"dur":6,"text":"Now from an economist's point of view, both\nof those criteria have problems."},"934":{"dur":6,"text":"If we only tax profits that come from the\nUnited States and don't tax profits that are"},"941":{"dur":5,"text":"earned overseas, we give U.S. companies an\nincentive to earn profits overseas, to push"},"946":{"dur":3,"text":"investment and jobs away from the United States."},"950":{"dur":7,"text":"That's been a theme of much of the Democratic\noratory in campaigns."},"957":{"dur":4,"text":"However we could solve that by having a worldwide\ntax."},"962":{"dur":5,"text":"If we had a worldwide tax and didn't have\ndeferral, we taxed everything as it was earned"},"968":{"dur":6,"text":"wherever it was earned, then we wouldn't be\ntreating foreign and domestic profits differently,"},"974":{"dur":5,"text":"but we would be vastly treating U.S. chartered\ncompanies different from foreign chartered"},"979":{"dur":5,"text":"companies and we'd give foreign companies\na tremendous competitive advantage, as many"},"984":{"dur":3,"text":"of the business people frequently point out."},"988":{"dur":1,"text":"So there's no good solution."},"990":{"dur":5,"text":"The problem is when independent countries\nare trying to have separate tax rules to meet"},"995":{"dur":8,"text":"their own needs and trying to address businesses\nthat are global in nature."},"1004":{"dur":5,"text":"It's very hard for separate countries to do\nthat and they can't do it in a perfect way."},"1009":{"dur":5,"text":"Now I've described the problem as a theoretical\neconomist would talk about it."},"1014":{"dur":1,"text":"Now let's get to the real world."},"1016":{"dur":4,"text":"Theoretical economists talk as if there was\nsuch a thing as the source of corporate profits"},"1021":{"dur":2,"text":"and the residence of corporations."},"1024":{"dur":6,"text":"However when you think about it, those are\nnot easy concepts and they're not clear concepts."},"1030":{"dur":9,"text":"Now you could say if you have a factory here,\nprofits produced by the workers in that factory"},"1040":{"dur":2,"text":"are profits that come from the United States."},"1042":{"dur":5,"text":"That is a pretty clear standard and when these\nrules were developed 100 years ago and source"},"1048":{"dur":5,"text":"was the main basis for international tax rules,\nthat was really where people...what people"},"1054":{"dur":7,"text":"thought of permanent establishments generating\nbusinesses, but today things are different."},"1061":{"dur":4,"text":"The real generator of value is not the manufacturing\nitself."},"1066":{"dur":3,"text":"It's the know how that enables the manufacturing."},"1069":{"dur":1,"text":"It's the patents."},"1070":{"dur":2,"text":"It's the techniques."},"1072":{"dur":3,"text":"It's the brand name reputation that allows\nyou to sell things."},"1076":{"dur":5,"text":"It's all of the collection of things that\nwe call intellectual property and intangible property."},"1082":{"dur":7,"text":"Apple has developed the skills and the techniques\nto produce an iPad."},"1089":{"dur":5,"text":"The profits from actually manufacturing the\niPad are not that great."},"1095":{"dur":7,"text":"The profits come from the iPad itself, the\ntechnology, and the technology can be owned"},"1102":{"dur":6,"text":"by a company anywhere in \nthe world."},"1109":{"dur":9,"text":"And it's unclear...there is no clear place to say, the technology is here. The technology is everywhere."},"1118":{"dur":8,"text":"So the concept of source falls down when companies\nare exchanging intellectual property for which"},"1127":{"dur":5,"text":"you can't tell what the right price is and\nputting intellectual property in all kinds"},"1132":{"dur":4,"text":"of different locations, usually low tax locations."},"1137":{"dur":2,"text":"Second issue: residence."},"1140":{"dur":7,"text":"As I said before, as we've discussed in our\npaper, residence is not really connected to"},"1147":{"dur":2,"text":"anything real about the company's activity."},"1150":{"dur":6,"text":"Not to its sales, not to its production, not\nto where its shareholders are."},"1156":{"dur":1,"text":"So what is residence?"},"1157":{"dur":2,"text":"It's where they have a piece of paper."},"1159":{"dur":5,"text":"If you try to tax residence...and granted\nthere are a lot of frictions in our system,"},"1164":{"dur":4,"text":"companies can't change residence easily all\nthe time...but if there is an incentive to"},"1169":{"dur":5,"text":"put your residence somewhere else for tax\nreasons, you can be sure that smart people"},"1175":{"dur":1,"text":"will figure out how to do it."},"1176":{"dur":1,"text":"Alan: We've certainly seen it happen, yeah."},"1177":{"dur":4,"text":"Eric: It happens and we've certainly seen\nit happen just as we've seen the location"},"1181":{"dur":1,"text":"of profits move."},"1182":{"dur":7,"text":"So we have a system that's really based on\nsand and this is the reason why we're seeing"},"1189":{"dur":5,"text":"an erosion of the corporate tax base, not\nonly in the United States, but throughout the world."},"1194":{"dur":8,"text":"Our view is we have this erosion of the corporate\ntax base at the same time we have high rates"},"1203":{"dur":4,"text":"that discourage certain kinds of businesses,\nparticularly domestic businesses and businesses"},"1208":{"dur":11,"text":"that don't have that much intellectual capital\nand cause residence of companies to move outside"},"1219":{"dur":1,"text":"of the United States."},"1221":{"dur":1,"text":"None of this is good."},"1222":{"dur":4,"text":"Alan: A lot of the attention has been paid\nto the so-called inversion transactions, where"},"1226":{"dur":5,"text":"an existing company basically swaps its U.S.\ncharter for a foreign charter, arranges it"},"1231":{"dur":4,"text":"so the parent of a corporate group has a piece\nof paper from a foreign country instead of"},"1236":{"dur":1,"text":"a U.S. company."},"1237":{"dur":4,"text":"And of
