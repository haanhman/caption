me."},"168":{"dur":7,"text":"And during the summers, I was working on farms\nand at home, I was helping in the kitchen."},"175":{"dur":3,"text":"And eventually, I went and worked in a restaurant."},"179":{"dur":7,"text":"And I just fell in love with it and I left\nschool and I started cooking."},"187":{"dur":2,"text":"And I worked my way up."},"189":{"dur":7,"text":"And I knew the

fine\ndining."},"315":{"dur":3,"text":"That was never a part of my plan."},"318":{"dur":4,"text":"I always detested the idea of working in these\nreally stuffy, formal environments."},"323":{"dur":5,"text":"And fine dining for me was the antithesis\nof who I was or what I wanted to represent."},"329":{"dur":6,"text":"But I loved working for Danny and he asked\nme to go work with Daniel as Eleven Madison"},"335":{"dur":1,"text":"Park was beginning its transformation."},"337":{"dur":1,"text":">>Female Presenter: Right."},"338":{"dur":1,"text":"So, tell us about that."},"339":{"dur":1,"text":"How did the partnership come to be?"},"341":{"dur":3,"text":"How did you guys find your way to Eleven Madison?"},"344":{"dur":1,"text":"You came through Danny."},"345":{"dur":1,"text":">>Will Guidara: Well, yeah."},"346":{"dur":1,"text":"So, it started with him."},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll let you actually start the story 'cause\nhe was at Campton Place."},"349":{"dur":6,"text":">>Daniel Humm: I was at Campton Place and\nI was in the US three years at that time."},"356":{"dur":5,"text":"And Danny called me and he said he had dinner\nat Campton Place and he loved it."},"362":{"dur":8,"text":"And he has this great restaurant in New York\nthat he wants to just make into a different"},"370":{"dur":8,"text":"restaurant because at that time, it was known\nto be a brasserie, and the food was like Cote"},"378":{"dur":4,"text":"de Boeuf , shellfish platters, French fries."},"382":{"dur":9,"text":"And Danny felt like Eleven Madison Park deserved\nto be a greater restaurant, a world class"},"392":{"dur":1,"text":"restaurant."},"393":{"dur":6,"text":"And at that time, I didn't know who Danny\nwas and I did some research and I only heard"},"399":{"dur":1,"text":"very positive things."},"401":{"dur":1,"text":"So, I started--."},"402":{"dur":1,"text":">>Female Presenter: Just Danny for everyone\nas a--."},"404":{"dur":1,"text":">>Daniel Humm: Danny Meyer."},"405":{"dur":1,"text":">>Female Presenter: Danny, yeah."},"406":{"dur":1,"text":">>Daniel Humm: Yes."},"407":{"dur":1,"text":">>Female

to."},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"[laughter]"},"425":{"dur":2,"text":">>Female Presenter: Those fries are no joke."},"427":{"dur":6,"text":">>Daniel Humm: And I had a great interview\nprocess with him because for me, as a chef"},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"coming to New York, it's tough."},"437":{"dur":8,"text":"And when don't get it right, I think in the\nbeginning, it's very hard to recover from"},"446":{"dur":1,"text":"it."},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"So, I really had to make--."},"448":{"dur":7,"text":"Because as a chef, all we have is reputation."},"456":{"dur":5,"text":"And this is like the thing that you have to\nreally be careful of, you know?"},"462":{"dur":5,"text":"And it can get damaged and then everything\nis down the drain."},"467":{"dur":6,"text":"And I've been cooking now for over 20 years,\nbut you really want to protect your reputation."},"474":{"dur":6,"text":"And coming to New York, I had to make sure\nI'm gonna work for the right guy, it's the"},"480":{"dur":4,"text":"right restaurant, it's the right time, and\nso forth."},"484":{"dur":9,"text":"And eventually, I decided to come and not\nfar into it, we also needed a strong person"},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"in the dining room."},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"And then, this is how we met."},"500":{"dur":8,"text":"Danny felt, and I think because Danny is a\nlot about the culture, that is unique and"},"509":{"dur":7,"text":"really powerful and different and he's been\na great mentor in that for me because nobody"},"517":{"dur":4,"text":"ever has taught me that side of the business."},"521":{"dur":6,"text":"But he felt that it was important to bring\nsomebody from within his organization who"},"527":{"dur":3,"text":"really knows the culture."},"530":{"dur":6,"text":"And we met briefly in meetings before and\nI asked."},"537":{"dur":1,"text":"I said, \"What about Will?\""},"538":{"dur":1,"text":"And--."},"539":{"dur":1,"text":">>Will Guidara: He pursued me."},"541":{"dur":1,"text":"[laughter]"},"542":{"dur":1,"text":">>Daniel Humm: Yeah."},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"And then, it was love at first sight."},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"[laughter]\n>>Will Guidara: We actually, whenever there"},"549":{"dur":4,"text":"was a GM there and Daniel and that GM weren't\ngetting along."},"553":{"dur":4,"text":"So, whenever it's that kind of thing, you\nneed to meet and get to know one another in"},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"clandestine ways."},"558":{"dur":4,"text":"So, we actually had, we met really, fully\nfor the first time right around the corner"},"563":{"dur":1,"text":"at Crispo."},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"Have you guys been to Crispo?"},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"And we gorged on pasta."},"568":{"dur":4,"text":"And then there's a little Dominican bar like,\nthree doors down from Crispo."},"572":{"dur":3,"text":"And we drank plenty of beers there."},"576":{"dur":6,"text":"And that gets me to where I was, where I didn't\nwant to be in fine dining, but I wanted to"},"582":{"dur":1,"text":"grow within Danny's company."},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"And he was a guy that I had a lot of respect\nfor."},"586":{"dur":5,"text":"And my dad, who's always played a very significant\nrole in my evolution, said, \"Listen, if this"},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"is a guy you respect and they ask you to do\nsomething, you should do it."},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"But put a time limit on it.\""},"597":{"dur":5,"text":"So, when I went to work with Daniel at Eleven\nMadison, it was supposed to be for a year."},"602":{"dur":5,"text":"And we'll tell the whole story of the evolution,\nbut within that year, what I hated about fine"},"608":{"dur":1,"text":"dining was that it needed to be stuffy."},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"It needed to be inaccessible."},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"It needed to be pretentious."},"613":{"dur":4,"text":"And I found though our youthfulness and through\nthe friendship that started to develop between"},"618":{"dur":3,"text":"the two of us, that it didn't actually need\nto be that way."},"622":{"dur":4,"text":"It was just that way because that's how it\nhad been before."},"626":{"dur":7,"text":"And within that year, we started approaching\nthe three Michelin star experience with a"},"634":{"dur":3,"text":"little bit more of a sense of humor."},"637":{"dur":3,"text":"And we started surrounding ourselves with\npeople who felt the same way."},"641":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, at the end of the year, they came\nback to me and they said, \"All right."},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"You've put in your year."},"645":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you."},"646":{"dur":1,"text":"It's time to move on.\""},"647":{"dur":1,"text":"And I said, \"No."},"648":{"dur":1,"text":"No, this is just starting to feel good.\""},"649":{"dur":4,"text":"And that was in 2007, so we've come a long\nway since then."},"653":{"dur":3,"text":">>Female Presenter: So, talk to us about that\nevolution because I remember going to Eleven"},"657":{"dur":1,"text":"Madison Park when I first moved to New York."},"659":{"dur":5,"text":"And I think my law firm took us there for\nsome sort of dinner and it was very different"},"664":{"dur":1,"text":"back then."},"665":{"dur":1,"text":"It was before you came on board."},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"It was much more upright, I guess."},"668":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, talk to us a little bit about the\nevolution that you came to create with your"},"672":{"dur":3,"text":"food and then how you came to influence that\nas well in the front."},"676":{"dur":4,"text":">>Will Guidara: I think in the beginning,\nit's clear."},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"When you're trying to make a restaurant better,\nthere's things that you know you need to do."},"683":{"dur":1,"text":"You need to have less seats."},"685":{"dur":4,"text":"When we got there, there were 190 seats in\nthe restaurant and that's just too many to"},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"do anything that's really world class."},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"So, we removed seats to get ahead."},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"We're now at 80 seats."},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"So, we've removed a ton of seats from the\nrestaurant."},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, you need to change the way that\nyou train your staff."},"701":{"dur":3,"text":"You need to get nicer china, nicer glassware,\nnicer silverware."},"705":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's all the obvious things."},"706":{"dur":5,"text":"But to Daniel's point, the thing that I think\nwe learned most from Danny, is the importance"},"712":{"dur":1,"text":"of culture."},"713":{"dur":4,"text":"And even beyond that, the importance of language\nto help define a culture."},"717":{"dur":4,"text":"We, at Eleven Madison Park, we have 150 people."},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"And now, with the new restaurant opening,\nwhich we'll talk about soon, we have 500 people"},"726":{"dur":1,"text":"in our company."},"727":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's a lot of people to get on the same\npage."},"731":{"dur":7,"text":"And I think language is really important to\nget people aligned in the spirit of our collective"},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"endeavor and the philosophy that we're trying\nto pursue."},"742":{"dur":5,"text":"So, the real evolution of Eleven Madison Park\nstarted--and you'll all see a picture of him"},"747":{"dur":5,"text":"if you bought the cookbook--with Miles Davis,\nwhich was our first review."},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"We got reviewed for the first time in the\nNew York Observer in 2006."},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"And it was a far better review than we deserved\nat the time."},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"We were not anywhere near as good as we wanted\nto be."},"763":{"dur":4,"text":"But at the end of the review, Moira Hobson,\nthe reviewer at the time, said that she wished"},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"we had a bit more Miles Davis."},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"And so we said, \"Wow."},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"That's really cool.\""},"771":{"dur":4,"text":"And then we're like, \"I have no idea what\nthat means.\""},"776":{"dur":1,"text":"[laughter]"},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"So, we started listening to a bunch of Miles\nand started reading a bunch about Miles."},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"And we came up with a list of 11 words."},"783":{"dur":6,"text":"And within that list were words like collaborative,\nfresh, endless reinvention, forward-moving."},"790":{"dur":3,"text":"And essentially, that list of words, which\nhangs in our kitchen now, along with a couple"},"794":{"dur":5,"text":"pictures of Miles, became our mission statement\nand essentially guided all of the decisions"},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"that we made."},"802":{"dur":4,"text":"When you listen to Miles' music, or when you\nread about Miles Davis, what you find is a"},"807":{"dur":1,"text":"guy that was instantly successful, right?"},"809":{"dur":4,"text":"With \"Kind of Blue,\" he released one of the\nmost seminal jazz albums in the history of"},"813":{"dur":1,"text":"jazz."},"815":{"dur":4,"text":"But then, rather than resting on his laurels,\nrather than sitting back and enjoying the"},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"ride, he completely changed his approach to\nmusic."},"823":{"dur":4,"text":"And then less than, I think it was five or\nsix years later, he released \"Bitches Brew,\""},"827":{"dur":4,"text":"where he was adding for the first time ever,\nelectric instrumentation to jazz, which is"},"831":{"dur":4,"text":"something that anyone who was a purist in\nthe art form at the time would've certainly"},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"said was going to fail."},"837":{"dur":6,"text":"And it was that approach to his music that\nmade him what we all know him now to be."},"843":{"dur":5,"text":"And the other thing that he did really, really\neffectively was he approached his music very"},"849":{"dur":1,"text":"collaboratively."},"850":{"dur":6,"text":"When you look at some of the great jazz musicians\nover time, most of them came from Miles' band."},"857":{"dur":5,"text":"And the reason that they went on to do such\ncool things is because it was never just Miles."},"862":{"dur":3,"text":"It was him and his entire band developing\nmusic together."},"865":{"dur":7,"text":"So, the evolution of Eleven Madison Park,\nI really believe, is due to--of that list"},"872":{"dur":3,"text":"of words--those two: endless reinvention and\ncollaborative."},"876":{"dur":2,"text":"Collaborative, starting with the two of us."},"878":{"dur":6,"text":"They're in restaurants, and you've seen Hell's\nKitchen or likely some of

friend."},"891":{"dur":2,"text":"Definitively, we should hate each other."},"894":{"dur":4,"text":"We should be yelling at each other throughout\nservice, but what we effectively realized"},"898":{"dur":4,"text":"was in order for work to A, be fun, in order\nfor us to have the capacity to do something"},"903":{"dur":3,"text":"significant in the dining room, we needed\nto be very collaborative in our approach."},"907":{"dur":2,"text":"It wasn't about the back of house and the\nfront of house."},"909":{"dur":3,"text":"It was about a restaurant that included a\nkitchen and a dining room."},"912":{"dur":1,"text":">>Female Presenter: You guys are really Bert\nand Ernie up here."},"914":{"dur":1,"text":">>Will Guidara: What's
