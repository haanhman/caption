response,\ninternet users have"},"416":{"dur":1,"text":"been ramping up on\ntheir side, too."},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"So when the government\nand authorities"},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"implement all sorts\nof new technology"},"422":{"dur":4,"text":"to monitor and surveil\ncitizens, and to censor content,"},"426":{"dur":1,"text":"internet users respond."},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"So one of the ways that\nI like to talk about"},"430":{"dur":3,"text":"is how government\nand the authorities"},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"figured out a way to really\nquickly highlight and figure"},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"out-- find posts-- that contain\nsensitive content by work"},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"searching for keywords."},"441":{"dur":1,"text":"In response, internet\nusers realized"},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"that governments and\nauthorities were doing this,"},"445":{"dur":3,"text":"and they decided to embed\ntheir text within images."},"449":{"dur":3,"text":"So sort of a

images,"},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"and doing sorts\nof image searches,"},"461":{"dur":1,"text":"and wiping them out right away."},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's a cat and mouse game\nthat goes back and forth,"},"465":{"dur":3,"text":"and it continues to this day."},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"So back to Weibo."},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"Some of the more specific ways\nthat the government actually"},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"does filter content on Weibo."},"475":{"dur":3,"text":"Posting certain keywords, either\nby themselves or in combination"},"479":{"dur":4,"text":"with other keywords, will give\nyou this really vague message"},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"that says, sorry, this content--\nand if you're interested,"},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"that keyword says\nWen Jiabao,

seeing"},"505":{"dur":0,"text":"what you get back."},"506":{"dur":4,"text":"So another way that they do\nit, simply by deleting content."},"510":{"dur":4,"text":"Content sometimes vanishes\nfrom Weibo without a trace,"},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"except there been websites like\nFree Weibo-- freeweibo.com--"},"518":{"dur":3,"text":"that actually suck up\nall the tweets that get"},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"posted on Weibo before\nthey get deleted."},"524":{"dur":1,"text":"And then when they\ndo get deleted,"},"525":{"dur":1,"text":"they actually\nretain a copy of it,"},"526":{"dur":1,"text":"and then share it with everyone."},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is an image that\ntook place in [?

then"},"551":{"dur":3,"text":"within a short amount of time,\nit was no longer on Weibo."},"555":{"dur":3,"text":"And actually, if you're trying\nto access it through the API,"},"558":{"dur":1,"text":"it'll give you a\nmessage that says,"},"559":{"dur":4,"text":"sorry, this content doesn't\nexist, or permission denied."},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's another\ntechnique that Weibo"},"567":{"dur":4,"text":"is very famed for using\nto get rid of content."},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"But my particular form\nof-- again, like I said,"},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"the information\ncontrol technique"},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"that I'm most interested\nin is the search blocks."},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"Search blocks are very

there."},"584":{"dur":1,"text":"However, what you're\ndoing is inhibiting people"},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"from finding information."},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's some sort\nof protest going

did this\nguy become a billionaire?"},"616":{"dur":1,"text":"His father, perhaps?"},"618":{"dur":6,"text":"So this sort of thing touches\non sensitive issues in China."},"624":{"dur":3,"text":"A lot of times, these words are\nblocked on Weibo in addition"},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"to being filtered in other ways."},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm not the only one\ndoing this sort of

fact"},"714":{"dur":1,"text":"that the government\nwanted to continue"},"716":{"dur":1,"text":"to allow citizens to\ncriticize him online."},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"So as you can see,\nthere's a correlation"},"720":{"dur":4,"text":"between online events\nand offline events, which"},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"seems fairly intuitive, but\nit's good to have the data there"},"726":{"dur":1,"text":"to actually show you."},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"So continuing on."},"730":{"dur":3,"text":"So what did I do?"},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"GreatFire, \"China Digital\nTimes,\" they do fantastic work"},"736":{"dur":3,"text":"in confirming, I think,\nwhat is sensitive"},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"and what isn't sensitive."},"740":{"dur":3,"text":"So for instance, Bo Xilai is\nin the news about a

thinks"},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"he's sensitive,\nand worth blocking."},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"However, what about all the\nwords that we don't know"},"753":{"dur":1,"text":"are sensitive?"},"755":{"dur":3,"text":"Like for instance, \"foot\nfetish,\" or other things"},"758":{"dur":0,"text":"like that?"},"759":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that's\nwhere I stepped in."},"761":{"dur":3,"text":"And what I did was I took\na giant list of words."},"764":{"dur":3,"text":"In this case, Wikipedia's\narticle titles"},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"in the Chinese

tested or not whether\nor not each word was blocked"},"779":{"dur":0,"text":"or not."},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I recorded\nthem into a database,"},"782":{"dur":3,"text":"and basically did

things."},"792":{"dur":4,"text":"So in the end, I came up\nwith 500 blocked keywords."},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"And in the book,\nI have 150 of them"},"798":{"dur":2,"text":"that I write up in\nmore
