instant."},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"You need to know as soon\nas a message arrives."},"712":{"dur":1,"text":"At the same time, it's\nalso crucial to use"},"714":{"dur":1,"text":"notifications wisely."},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"It's terrible to have too\nmany notifications."},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"It's worse than having\nnone at all."},"720":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's why on any version\nof

notifications\nthat would otherwise be"},"743":{"dur":4,"text":"displayed on top of one another,\nthe basic rule of"},"747":{"dur":3,"text":"thumb is that your app should\nnever appear more than once
