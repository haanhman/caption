about this session?"},"32":{"dur":1,"text":"- Well I think what's\n different, at least initially,"},"34":{"dur":1,"text":"is that there's really\n   not this incendiary

the analogy was"},"126":{"dur":1,"text":"it's like two\n  boxers, first round."},"127":{"dur":2,"text":"Just kind of feeling\n  each other out,"},"130":{"dur":2,"text":"nobody really throwing any\n punches or anything like that."},"132":{"dur":4,"text":"It's just because the oil\n  price is the real x-factor."},"137":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Mac] That is exactly right."},"138":{"dur":1,"text":"And we've got a lot of\n   issues that are coming up."},"140":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that the pace might\n  change a little bit here,"},"143":{"dur":1,"text":"as we get into\nbudgeting for higher

here in terms of pace"},"157":{"dur":1,"text":"picking up this session."},"158":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Dave] You know, you\n  mention the higher education"},"159":{"dur":3,"text":"and some of the other\n spending issues."},"163":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's jump into higher education"},"164":{"dur":2,"text":"because the higher\n   education budget"},"166":{"dur":2,"text":"was before I think, was\nit House

been talk about\n  the legislature taking back"},"177":{"dur":2,"text":"control of setting tuition."},"179":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's been\n   debate about that."},"181":{"dur":2,"text":"And of

it is a top down\n   chancellor driven system."},"257":{"dur":2,"text":"And there are pros\n and cons depending on"},"260":{"dur":1,"text":"which side you're on on that."},"261":{"dur":3,"text":"But I do think we've, in\nlarge, we have something"},"264":{"dur":1,"text":"very good going\n   on with higher ed."},"266":{"dur":1,"text":"And we can take it\n   to the next level"},"268":{"dur":1,"text":"with the good fortune\n that we've seen."},"269":{"dur":2,"text":"- With the resignation of\n the Board of Higher Education"},"272":{"dur":4,"text":"president, and the

detract\n   away from the opportunity"},"294":{"dur":2,"text":"that we have when it\n  comes to higher ed."},"296":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll be advancing a proposal,"},"297":{"dur":2,"text":"I believe it will be bipartisan\nat the end of the day,"},"300":{"dur":2,"text":"that would take the Foundation\n Aid Stabilization Fund"},"303":{"dur":2,"text":"and create a merit-based\nscholarship

that?"},"333":{"dur":2,"text":"- [Mac] I just think\nit became more an issue"},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"of personality\n  rather than policy."},"338":{"dur":3,"text":"I think it's perfectly\nfair to say that tuition"},"341":{"dur":1,"text":"should be lower."},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"It's perfectly fair to say\n  the board needs to do better"},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"when it comes to\n   open meeting laws."},"347":{"dur":1,"text":"But I think what\nhappened to Ms. Diedrich"},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"more approached\n  political bloodsport"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"and I think that just\n   detracts from the process."},"353":{"dur":2,"text":"- Is it some residual effect"},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"that the Measure 3 did not pass?"},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"- I hope it's not\n something that petty,"},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"but I can't say that\nthat's not part of that."},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a certain segment\n   of the legislature"},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"that they have it\n   out for higher ed."},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think the vast\nmajority of legislators,"},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"Democrat and Republican,\nI think they want"},"371":{"dur":1,"text":"to improve the system."},"373":{"dur":1,"text":"And so, I'd like to us go\n   forward with those kind of"},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"good faith discussions\n about higher ed,"},"377":{"dur":3,"text":"rather than, you know, more\n  battles over personality."},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"Now to talk to your\n proposal about taking"},"382":{"dur":1,"text":"the Foundation Aid\n   Stabilization Fund"},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"and having it a\n  scholarship program,"},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"what kind of traction are\n  you getting with that idea?"},"389":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Mac] Well I think it's\n   been pretty well received."},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"And obviously the proposals\n  not in the hopper yet,"},"393":{"dur":1,"text":"we're still working\n  on the fine-tuning."},"394":{"dur":1,"text":"Want to get as much\n  buy in as possible"},"396":{"dur":3,"text":"before you drop something\n   that is that bold."},"399":{"dur":2,"text":"But the idea's a\n   pretty basic one."},"401":{"dur":1,"text":"We have this fund,\n   the sleepy fund,"},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"Foundation Aids\n  Stabilization Fund."},"405":{"dur":1,"text":"It's boring in title even."},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"But it's brimming with\nabout a billion dollars."},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"We've only used it I believe\n  once about 20 years ago"},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"to stabilize foundation aid."},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"You know payments to\n  elementary schools"},"417":{"dur":2,"text":"and secondary schools\n throughout the state."},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's a fund that's\n  really outgrown its purpose."},"422":{"dur":3,"text":"And you can have this nearly\n  one billion dollar endowment"},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"to fund access to higher\ned forever essentially,"},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"without taking away from\nany other priorities."},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"So I really see it as seed corn."},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"You know this time\n of uncertainty caused"},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"by low oil prices should\nbe a soft lesson to us,"},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"that in the long-term we want\n to diversify our economy."},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'm not sure\n what the big industry"},"442":{"dur":1,"text":"is going to be 50\n  years down the road,"},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"but I can bet it would take\n  an education to get it."},"446":{"dur":1,"text":"So I think it's a great\n   way to take this one time"},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"development of our\n   natural resources"},"450":{"dur":1,"text":"and the revenue\n that's come from that"},"451":{"dur":1,"text":"and make a permanent\n   investment in our people."},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Dave] Well you\n  mention the one pot,"},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"which is the, as you\n   said, they're kind of the"},"456":{"dur":1,"text":"boring, sleepy fund."},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"But there are other\n   proposals to dip into it,"},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"one for a school owned\n construction fund."},"462":{"dur":5,"text":"Also to pay off the defined\n  benefit retirement plan"},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"and get employees,\n  new state employees"},"470":{"dur":3,"text":"going into a defined\n  contribution plan."},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"What do you think?"},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"- I'm not particular\n  enthusiastic about\n  using this fund"},"477":{"dur":1,"text":"for a retirement purpose."},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"I think this is\n   an education fund."},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I think we can have,\n  you know, disagreements"},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"about where that should go,"},"484":{"dur":1,"text":"but let's try to keep it\n   in the realm of education."},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"A revolving loan\n  fund for education,"},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"that's seems to be an\nappropriate purpose too."},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"And so what the size\n is of this endowment,"},"493":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that's something\nthe legislature"},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"should have a good debate about."},"496":{"dur":1,"text":"Take a look at Wyoming,"},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"their Hathaway\n scholarship endowment,"},"499":{"dur":1,"text":"I think it was\n  about $450 million,"},"500":{"dur":3,"text":"and that provides a lot\nof access to higher ed"},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"in that state for Wyoming's\n  best and brightest."},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"So you could do a lot with\n   a $500 million endowment"},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"and still have some left over\n for a revolving loan fund."},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"So it should be a\n  fun debate to have."},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"It's something where we\ncan think big thoughts"},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"and plan long-term\n   for the future."},"518":{"dur":1,"text":"Speaking of thinking\n big thoughts, you know"},"520":{"dur":4,"text":"there's been push for pre-K\n  education and childcare."},"525":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's stalled in\n  previous sessions."},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"Is there momentum now\nto do something on that?"},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Mac] I think there is."},"531":{"dur":1,"text":"And I want to give\n   a lot of credit to"},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"Senator Joan Heckaman\nand Senator Phil Murphy"},"535":{"dur":1,"text":"for their leadership\n  on this issue."},"537":{"dur":1,"text":"Senator Heckaman\n   being an educator."},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"Senator Murphy is\n  an educator as well,"},"541":{"dur":1,"text":"married to a\n kindergarten teacher."},"542":{"dur":1,"text":"And they've advanced this issue"},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"for every session that they've\n been in the legislature."},"547":{"dur":1,"text":"And you look at nationally\n   what's happening,"},"549":{"dur":3,"text":"states like Alabama,\n  Oklahoma, Georgia,"},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"you know, ruby red states\n   that are moving towards"},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"universal pre-K."},"556":{"dur":1,"text":"This is something\n   where North Dakota"},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"is way behind and we\n absolutely have the resources"},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"to catch up."},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"And so you're going\n  to see a proposal"},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"that would essentially\n   guarantee access to pre-K"},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"for every four year\n  old in North Dakota."},"568":{"dur":1,"text":"And if we don't get\n  there this session,"},"570":{"dur":1,"text":"we're going to get\n  there next session."},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"It's something that\n  absolutely is the right move"},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"for this state."},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"- Which is interesting\n in that you represent"},"576":{"dur":1,"text":"a border town."},"578":{"dur":0,"text":"Minnesota's going through\n   some of the same issues"},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"to with pre-K."},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Mac] That's right."},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"And you know\nMinnesota's ahead of us"},"582":{"dur":1,"text":"nearly every other\n  state is ahead of us"},"584":{"dur":1,"text":"when it comes to pre-K."},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, North Dakota we\ncan't say it's a matter"},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"of a lack of resources."},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"It's just a lack\n   of political will."},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"But I think the wheels\n are turning on that."},"593":{"dur":3,"text":"And certainly Senator\n Flakoll's advanced a proposal,"},"597":{"dur":1,"text":"as well co-sponsored\n  by Senator Heckaman."},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, I think there's\nagreement to, at\nleast in the Senate"},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"that we all should move\nin the same direction."},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"I guess, you know, we'd like\nto take it a little bit farther"},"605":{"dur":1,"text":"in that direction."},"606":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Dave] Yeah there\n are business interests"},"607":{"dur":1,"text":"who are basically saying\nthis is a good idea."},"609":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Mac] Yeah."},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"- Even, you know, just\nchildcare is a good idea"},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"that they've been trying for,"},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"because of the lack of workers."},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yes, it's both a\n   short-term and a long-term"},"619":{"dur":1,"text":"workforce issue."},"621":{"dur":3,"text":"When four year olds\n have access to pre-K,"},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"that's not only a\n  wonderful education"},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"and a start in life that\n  they wouldn't otherwise get."},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"It's also childcare and\n  equality childcare at that."},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"And so, and then long-term\n   obviously they're"},"634":{"dur":1,"text":"going to have the\n   benefits from starting out"},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"their education\nappropriately with that"},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"early childhood

an"},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"inter-Republican party\n   food fight at this point."},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't see anything\n wrong with the current"},"674":{"dur":1,"text":"North Dakota standards."},"676":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think that's\n  important to understand too."},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"This isn't something\nthat was foisted upon us"},"680":{"dur":1,"text":"by the federal

distract it from a lot"},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"of these other issues."},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"Our goal in this\nstate should be,"},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"with our tremendous\n  wealth that we have,"},"695":{"dur":1,"text":"it should be to have the\nbest education system"},"697":{"dur":3,"text":"in the country, from early\nchildhood through post-graduate."},"701":{"dur":3,"text":"And this fighting\n   over Common Core"},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"I think just takes\n   away from that."},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"- So if you were\n   a betting person,"},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"would you bet the

going to be"},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"a very brief, but\n   very intense fight"},"717":{"dur":1,"text":"on the floor of the House."},"719":{"dur":3,"text":"And then I think the effort\n  to repeal
