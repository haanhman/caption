chair."},"141":{"dur":1,"text":"I appreciate that."},"142":{"dur":1,"text":"Now the interesting\nthing about that story,"},"144":{"dur":1,"text":"though, is two really\nimportant points."},"146":{"dur":2,"text":"First of all, there's a lot\nmore space between yes and no"},"149":{"dur":1,"text":"than most of us realize."},"150":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, sometimes\nwe get into sort"},"152":{"dur":2,"text":"of a binary, on\/off,\nyes\/no sort of thing."},"155":{"dur":1,"text":"And we don't realize\nhow much space"},"157":{"dur":3,"text":"there really there if we\njust give the other side"},"160":{"dur":3,"text":"a little bit of time to sort of\nthink, a moment, if you will."},"163":{"dur":2,"text":"There's some data out there that\nindicates to us that a moment"},"166":{"dur":0,"text":"is just three seconds."},"167":{"dur":3,"text":"And three seconds can be an\neternity for a mind process."},"170":{"dur":2,"text":"So the other thing that's\nalso really interesting"},"172":{"dur":2,"text":"about that, and I think\nit's one of the completely"},"174":{"dur":1,"text":"different approaches\nwe take in the book,"},"176":{"dur":3,"text":"is what happens after\nthe other side says no?"},"179":{"dur":2,"text":"Now early on in my career,\nI came across a book"},"181":{"dur":3,"text":"that I still refer to all the\ntime called \"Start With No\""},"185":{"dur":1,"text":"by a guy named Jim Camp."},"186":{"dur":3,"text":"And Camp's theory was, if\nyou make the other side feel"},"190":{"dur":3,"text":"free that they can\nsay no at any time,"},"193":{"dur":1,"text":"then it respects their autonomy."},"195":{"dur":1,"text":"They'll relax a little bit more."},"196":{"dur":1,"text":"They'll be more willing\nto work with you just"},"198":{"dur":2,"text":"knowing that it's OK to say no."},"200":{"dur":1,"text":"So we decided to take\nit one step further"},"202":{"dur":4,"text":"and see what happens when\nsomeone actually says no."},"206":{"dur":4,"text":"And since yes is protection--\nor no, yes is commitment,"},"211":{"dur":2,"text":"and we don't know what\nwe've gotten ourselves into,"},"213":{"dur":2,"text":"which is why we're\nscared to say yes,"},"216":{"dur":2,"text":"but no is protection--\nthat typically what"},"219":{"dur":2,"text":"we find is as soon\nas somebody says no"},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"and if they feel protected,\nthey tend to relax."},"224":{"dur":1,"text":"They center a little bit more."},"225":{"dur":1,"text":"And they can think\nmore quickly, which is"},"227":{"dur":2,"text":"exactly what happened with you."},"229":{"dur":2,"text":"You inadvertently\ntriggered a no."},"231":{"dur":3,"text":"You remained very pleasant\nin the way you talked to her."},"235":{"dur":5,"text":"And we know that if we're\npleasant to interact with,"},"241":{"dur":2,"text":"it actually helps the\nother person think better."},"243":{"dur":2,"text":"Because your mind\nworks up to 31%"},"245":{"dur":2,"text":"more effectively if you're\nin a positive frame of mind."},"248":{"dur":1,"text":"So when you're in a\npositive frame of mind,"},"250":{"dur":1,"text":"it triggers it in somebody else."},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"And it makes them smarter\njust by smiling at them,"},"254":{"dur":3,"text":"having-- you've got a\nwonderful tone of voice."},"257":{"dur":2,"text":"So she's already making this\nperson smarter by the way"},"260":{"dur":2,"text":"she interacts with her."},"263":{"dur":3,"text":"Your counterpart says no,\nwhich she now sort of centers"},"267":{"dur":2,"text":"herself and triggers-- you\ngive her a moment of time."},"269":{"dur":2,"text":"And the next thing you know,\nshe's strong ideas at you"},"271":{"dur":1,"text":"and working it out."},"272":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's finding that\nspace between yes and no."},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"And many times,\nit's triggered when"},"278":{"dur":1,"text":"the other person\nactually says no,"},"280":{"dur":1,"text":"because they feel protected."},"281":{"dur":1,"text":"And they feel safe."},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"And people are more likely\nonce they feel protected"},"285":{"dur":1,"text":"and safe to interact with you."},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"So just in a few short\nmoments, you were brilliant."},"289":{"dur":1,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"290":{"dur":1,"text":"MAIRIN CHESNEY: Thank you."},"292":{"dur":5,"text":"So after that first\nno, kind of in general,"},"297":{"dur":2,"text":"what's the correct response?"},"300":{"dur":1,"text":"Earlier when we\nwere chatting, you"},"301":{"dur":3,"text":"said, well, you don't\nwant to ask a-- you don't"},"305":{"dur":1,"text":"want to attack in any way."},"306":{"dur":0,"text":"You don't want to--"},"307":{"dur":1,"text":"MAIRIN CHESNEY: So\nwhat's the right approach"},"309":{"dur":1,"text":"after that initial no?"},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"CHRIS VOSS: Well, first\nof all, just to hesitate,"},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"give them a chance to think."},"314":{"dur":1,"text":"Because you never\nknow what's going"},"315":{"dur":1,"text":"through the other\nperson's mind when"},"316":{"dur":0,"text":"you start talking with them."},"317":{"dur":1,"text":"There's probably\nfour or five things"},"319":{"dur":2,"text":"that have been going through\ntheir mind throughout the day."},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"So giving them a chance\nto sort of focus on you"},"323":{"dur":1,"text":"is the other thing that no does."},"325":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'll give you another hint."},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"Like, we never call\nanybody on the phone"},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"and say, have you got a\nfew minutes to talk-- ever."},"331":{"dur":1,"text":"Because if you say\nthat to somebody,"},"333":{"dur":1,"text":"a whole bunch of things start\ngoing through their mind--"},"335":{"dur":1,"text":"how long is a few minutes?"},"336":{"dur":0,"text":"Do I have a few minutes?"},"337":{"dur":1,"text":"Do I want to talk to you?"},"338":{"dur":0,"text":"Do I even like you?"},"339":{"dur":1,"text":"All these things go\nthrough their mind."},"341":{"dur":3,"text":"Whenever we call someone, we\nsay, is now a bad time to talk?"},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"And you get one of\ntwo responses on that."},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"The person will say no, no."},"350":{"dur":1,"text":"It's never a bad time to talk."},"351":{"dur":1,"text":"What do you want to talk about?"},"352":{"dur":1,"text":"And they're very focused."},"354":{"dur":1,"text":"Or they'll say yeah, as\na matter of fact it is."},"355":{"dur":1,"text":"But I can talk at\ntwo o'clock tomorrow."},"357":{"dur":3,"text":"And you get a\nscheduled time to talk."},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"Now the follow-up to that,\nif nothing good happens"},"363":{"dur":3,"text":"in that space that happens\nafter that, the next most"},"366":{"dur":3,"text":"important thing to do\nis get the other person"},"370":{"dur":5,"text":"the say that's right-- not\nyou're right, but that's right."},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"And you get a that's\nright when you"},"377":{"dur":3,"text":"summarize the situation from the\nother person's point of view."},"381":{"dur":4,"text":"Don't be afraid to summarize a\nsituation that sounds like it's"},"385":{"dur":1,"text":"against your best interests."},"387":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, that's\nactually the key to it."},"389":{"dur":3,"text":"And we've broken open a\nnumber of negotiations."},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"But it's a summary\nof the facts and how"},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"the other person sees them."},"398":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's right will\nthen move you forward in,"},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"like, ridiculously\nphenomenal ways."},"404":{"dur":2,"text":"It's actually-- there's a\nnumber of different reasons"},"406":{"dur":1,"text":"why we think that it works."},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"One of the reasons\nis-- my co-writer"},"410":{"dur":1,"text":"Talh Raz is brilliant."},"411":{"dur":4,"text":"And read anything he's written--\nTalh Raz-- T-A-H-L R-A-Z."},"416":{"dur":1,"text":"If he's written it,\nit's well written,"},"418":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's worth reading."},"419":{"dur":1,"text":"But we were going through this."},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"And he said, I think it\ntriggers a subtle epiphany."},"423":{"dur":1,"text":"Because think of\nthe number of times"},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"when you've heard\nsomeone on TV or you've"},"427":{"dur":3,"text":"seen a slogan that you\ntotally agreed with"},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"and your reaction\nis, that's right."},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, that's right\nis when you completely"},"435":{"dur":3,"text":"agree with something and you\nthink it's the complete truth."},"439":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's a powerful thing\nto get somebody to say."},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"The other thing I\nthink it is is-- we"},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"think it is is if\nsomeone you're talking"},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"to says that to you,\nthey're telling you they"},"450":{"dur":3,"text":"feel empathy with you\nat that brief moment."},"453":{"dur":3,"text":"And there's a difference\nbetween empathy and sympathy."},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"But when they feel\nempathy from you,"},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"they feel connected with you."},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"And they want to collaborate."},"462":{"dur":4,"text":"So if you get a no, the very\nnext most important thing"},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"to try to get out of\nsomebody is that's right."},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"MAIRIN CHESNEY: And so it\nsounds like the that's right"},"472":{"dur":3,"text":"is similar to oh, you get it."},"475":{"dur":0,"text":"CHRIS VOSS: Yeah, yeah."},"476":{"dur":1,"text":"MAIRIN CHESNEY: And there are--"},"477":{"dur":0,"text":"MAIRIN CHESNEY:\nThere are a couple"},"478":{"dur":1,"text":"of times where in\ndifferent ways,"},"480":{"dur":5,"text":"you sort of highlight the\nimportance of your counterpart"},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"feeling like you get it, you\nknow, finding their religion"},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"CHRIS VOSS: Yes."},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"MAIRIN CHESNEY: --you know,\ntriggering a that's right."},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"And so how is this\nempathy and oh,"},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"you understand important\nin a negotiation?"},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"CHRIS VOSS: You know,\nthat's a great question."},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"Because we believe the\nworld, the entire world"},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"breaks down into three basic\napproaches to conflict."},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's basically fight,\nflight, or make friends."},"509":{"dur":4,"text":"And each one, something\nis more important to them"},"513":{"dur":1,"text":"than making the deal."},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"The deal is secondary to each\none of those three types."},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"And one particular\ntype that I happen"},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"to belong to-- the assertive\ntype, the natural born"},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"assertives."},"524":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, we think\nof ourselves as being"},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"very direct and honest."},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"It's more important\nthat you actually"},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"understand where I'm coming\nfrom than you agree with me."},"534":{"dur":4,"text":"I want to know you\nknow what I mean."},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"If you know completely what\nmy perspective is and I'm"},"541":{"dur":3,"text":"satisfied that\nyou've heard me out,"},"544":{"dur":1,"text":"then there's a\npretty good chance"},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"that I'm going to\nagree to your deal"},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"as long as you know\nwhere I'm coming from."},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, it's sort\nof like if you work"},"552":{"dur":6,"text":"for a boss who wasn't doing\nwhat you want him or her to do,"},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"well, if you understood-- if\nthey knew that you knew where"},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"you were coming from,\nthey accepted everything"},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"that you said, you actually\nwouldn't have a problem if they"},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"didn't follow your advice just\nas long as you were 1,000% sure"},"570":{"dur":1,"text":"they knew where you\nwere coming from."},"572":{"dur":3,"text":"So the other two\ntypes, you know,"},"575":{"dur":4,"text":"what we call the accommodator,\nfriend-oriented person--"},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"they want to make sure that\nwe have a great relationship."},"582":{"dur":1,"text":"If we don't make\na deal, it's fine."},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"But as long as you know that\nI like you and I feel you"},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"like me-- that's important."},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"And then a third type\nis the analytical."},"590":{"dur":3,"text":"And they're highly\npragmatic, try"},"594":{"dur":4,"text":"very hard to make\ndispassionate decisions."},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"As long as they\nhave the opportunity"},"600":{"dur":4,"text":"to share their reason for what\nthey want, they're thinking,"},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"the results of their analysis,\nthen they're happy also."},"608":{"dur":1,"text":"So there are other\nthings more important"},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"than making a deal to all of us."},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"MAIRIN CHESNEY: Do you\nfind that people usually"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"fall pretty strongly into\none of these three camps?"},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"Or are some people\na combination of two"},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"or even a combination\nof all three?"},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"CHRIS VOSS: Well, you end up--\nthe more experienced you get,"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"you tend to pick up traits\nfrom the other two types."},"625":{"dur":4,"text":"Because to be a complete\nnegotiator or even a rainmaker,"},"629":{"dur":0,"text":"you need all three."},"630":{"dur":3,"text":"You need to be able to\nassert your best position."},"634":{"dur":1,"text":"You need to get\nalong with people."},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"And you need to be\nable to analyze."},"639":{"dur":5,"text":"So very few people are just like\nstone cold one of the three."},"644":{"dur":4,"text":"And then as we learn, we begin\nto pick up the other types."},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"So the assertives\nand the analysts"},"650":{"dur":4,"text":"tend to pick up the\naccommodators' characteristics,"},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"because there's some solid\ndata out there that indicates"},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"that you're six times\nmore likely to make"},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"a deal with somebody you like."},"663":{"dur":3,"text":"And as an assertive, I\nwant to know the better way"},"666":{"dur":0,"text":"to come to agreement."},"667":{"dur":1,"text":"So if you enjoy\ninteracting with me,"},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"that increases good chances\nthat I'll get what I want,"},"671":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm good with that."},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"MAIRIN CHESNEY: And then\ndo you have to sort of-- do"},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"you have to adapt your\ntechnique depending on who"},"677":{"dur":1,"text":"you're dealing with as well?"},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"CHRIS VOSS: Well, you\nlearn, and then you"},"680":{"dur":3,"text":"begin to understand that if you\nhave an impasse, if you have"},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"a disagreement, how\nthe other person might"},"687":{"dur":6,"text":"be looking at it in really\nbroad characteristics."},"693":{"dur":3,"text":"Like for example, just\nsilence-- dead silence--"},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"each one of those three\ntypes looks at silence"},"699":{"dur":1,"text":"very differently."},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"As an assertive,\nif you're quiet,"},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"I think that means you\nwant to hear more from me."},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I talk."},"707":{"dur":4,"text":"Where if you're an\nanalyst and you're quiet,"},"711":{"dur":1,"text":"you just want to think."},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"And I could completely\nmisinterpret that, you know?"},"716":{"dur":1,"text":"And you're happy\nwhen I go silent,"},"717":{"dur":3,"text":"because you're like thank god,\nhe shut up so I can think."},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"And then the accommodator,\nwho's very relationship"},"724":{"dur":1,"text":"focused, when there's\nsilence-- well,"},"725":{"dur":1,"text":"the only time the\naccommodator goes silent"},"727":{"dur":1,"text":"is when they're mad."},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"So if we're talking and\nyou go silent on me,"},"731":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm afraid you're mad at me."},"733":{"dur":3,"text":"So when there's an impasse,\nwhen there's a difference, when"},"736":{"dur":1,"text":"you having a\nproblem, it's usually"},"738":{"dur":2,"text":"a result of the three types."},"740":{"dur":0,"text":"MAIRIN CHESNEY: Mhm."},"741":{"dur":3,"text":"CHRIS VOSS: My co-writer\nThal is highly analytical."},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, he's a brilliant guy."},"748":{"dur":1,"text":"And I sent him an\ne-mail once

on."},"756":{"dur":1,"text":"I wanted it written a\nlittle bit differently."},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"And a writer will say,\nchange whatever you want."},"760":{"dur":1,"text":"But that's their
