life-changing magic\nof not giving a fuck happened to me."},"168":{"dur":1,"text":"Two and a half years ago,"},"170":{"dur":3,"text":"I was a senior editor\nat a major New York publishing house."},"174":{"dur":3,"text":"I had spent 15 years\nclawing my way up the corporate ladder,"},"177":{"dur":2,"text":"I had a roster of best-selling authors,"},"180":{"dur":4,"text":"and everything I

before turning around,"},"206":{"dur":3,"text":"going home, and doing it all over again."},"210":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I quit."},"213":{"dur":3,"text":"And making that decision\nwas also really hard."},"216":{"dur":2,"text":"A lot of red wine, a lot of tears."},"219":{"dur":4,"text":"But what came after I quit\nwas nothing short of life-changing."},"225":{"dur":3,"text":"Once I removed myself\nfrom the culture and lifestyle"},"229":{"dur":2,"text":"of a job that had been\nmaking me so unhappy,"},"232":{"dur":4,"text":"I was free to focus my time and energy\non what would make me happy -"},"237":{"dur":3,"text":"including working,\nbut just in a different way -"},"240":{"dur":5,"text":"and eventually, on moving\nfrom Brooklyn to a tropical island."},"245":{"dur":5,"text":"I stopped giving my fucks to working\nfor a corporation, wearing pants,"},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"and taking those long subway commutes."},"255":{"dur":5,"text":"And I started giving my fucks\nto working for myself, wearing bikinis,"},"260":{"dur":2,"text":"and taking long walks on the beach."},"262":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm telling you, life changing."},"266":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"267":{"dur":4,"text":"But none of that change happened\nbecause I had tidied up my apartment."},"272":{"dur":2,"text":"It happened because I cleared out my mind."},"276":{"dur":1,"text":"Let me try and explain."},"278":{"dur":3,"text":"Imagine your mind is a barn,"},"281":{"dur":3,"text":"and inside it is are all of the things\nthat bring you joy,"},"285":{"dur":4,"text":"but also, all of the stuff\nthat annoys you."},"290":{"dur":2,"text":"The potential for a happy life is there,"},"292":{"dur":3,"text":"but you have to clear out the annoy\nto make room for the joy."},"297":{"dur":3,"text":"This is mental de-cluttering,\nand it is magical."},"301":{"dur":3,"text":"I did it by accident when I quit my job,\nbut it was so amazing"},"305":{"dur":3,"text":"that I developed a way for you\nto do it on purpose."},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"I call it \"the not sorry method.\""},"313":{"dur":2,"text":"It has two steps."},"315":{"dur":4,"text":"Step one: Decide what\nyou don't give a fuck about."},"320":{"dur":3,"text":"Step two: Don't give a fuck\nabout those things."},"324":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"327":{"dur":1,"text":"Simple, right?"},"329":{"dur":1,"text":"But I know what you're thinking:"},"331":{"dur":3,"text":"This sounds like a recipe\nfor turning into an asshole."},"334":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"337":{"dur":1,"text":"It's okay, I get that a lot."},"339":{"dur":3,"text":"But that's where\nthe \"not sorry\" part comes in."},"343":{"dur":6,"text":"My method is all about not giving a fuck\nusing honesty and politeness."},"350":{"dur":2,"text":"So in the end,\nyou don't have to feel guilty."},"353":{"dur":4,"text":"You are on your best behavior, \nand you have nothing to apologize for."},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"You are quite literally not sorry."},"363":{"dur":1,"text":"You're also not an asshole."},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"So how might the not sorry\nmethod work for you?"},"370":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, let's say, you love\n'Game of Thrones'"},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"and you've been invited\nto a Sunday night dinner party"},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"that interferes with watching\nyour favorite show."},"381":{"dur":2,"text":"You feel bad about\nturning down the invite,"},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"but you really love 'Game of Thrones,'"},"385":{"dur":4,"text":"and you don't want to record it\nto watch later because... spoilers."},"390":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, you only have so much time, energy,\nand money to spend on Sunday night."},"397":{"dur":3,"text":"So, you need to consult your fuck budget."},"400":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"Decide which activity brings more joy"},"406":{"dur":3,"text":"and allocate your fuck bucks accordingly."},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"(Laughter)"},"411":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm telling you,"},"413":{"dur":3,"text":"if you respond in a timely fashion,"},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"\"No thanks, can't make it\nto that dinner party,\""},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"you've done nothing wrong."},"421":{"dur":4,"text":"You were honest, you were polite,\nand you don't have to be sorry about it."},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's just the tip of the fuck-berg."},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"(Laughter)"},"433":{"dur":3,"text":"You can apply the \"not sorry\"\nmethod to anything:"},"437":{"dur":3,"text":"tasks, events, obligations, even people."},"442":{"dur":4,"text":"You start by making a list of everything\nthat's cluttering up your mental barn;"},"447":{"dur":3,"text":"all of the impositions on your time,\nenergy, and money;"},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"the fucks you're being asked to give."},"455":{"dur":3,"text":"To keep it manageable, I go by category."},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"So for example, work is one category,"},"461":{"dur":6,"text":"and five fucks on your list might be\nmandatory meetings, conference calls,"},"468":{"dur":3,"text":"your coworkers charity half-marathon,"},"472":{"dur":3,"text":"a going away party for a coworker\nyou don't even like,"},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"and doing your actual job."},"478":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"480":{"dur":3,"text":"Once you've listed them all out,\nyou perform the \"not sorry\" method."},"484":{"dur":4,"text":"Step one: Decide what annoys you."},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"Non-essential stuff you don't care about."},"492":{"dur":6,"text":"Step two: Stop giving your fucks\nin the form of time, energy, and money"},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"to those things."},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"Then cross them off your list\nwith a big black marker."},"504":{"dur":3,"text":"It feels good, just go with it."},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"510":{"dur":4,"text":"What I'm saying is, yes, you may have to\nget up and go to work every day,"},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"and you may have to attend\nsome mandatory meetings."},"518":{"dur":3,"text":"But you do not have to attend\na going away party"},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"for a colleague you don't even like."},"526":{"dur":3,"text":"But if you are still having trouble\nnot giving that fuck?"},"529":{"dur":3,"text":"I recommend a visualization exercise."},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"Picture how you're going to feel\nwhen you walk into that party:"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"annoyed or full of joy?"},"540":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"It's been a long day, your feet hurt,"},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"you don't love socializing\nwith your colleagues at the office,"},"549":{"dur":1,"text":"let alone at a shitty bar."},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"552":{"dur":3,"text":"You really don't love pitchers\nof warm Coors Light."},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"So, what should you do?"},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"RSVP 'No' of course."},"561":{"dur":5,"text":"Why would you spend your fuck bucks\nor your actual bucks on this party?"},"568":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll tell you why."},"570":{"dur":4,"text":"You do it because you feel\nobligated and guilty."},"576":{"dur":4,"text":"You are psyching yourself out\nof a perfectly fine response, \"No,\""},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"before you even try it."},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"Most people just don't think\nthis stuff through."},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"They say \"Yes\" to things\nlike this right away,"},"589":{"dur":3,"text":"then wind up wasting time,\nenergy, and money"},"593":{"dur":3,"text":"on an annoying, unenjoyable night out."},"597":{"dur":4,"text":"You waste even more time and energy\njust dreading the party a week beforehand."},"602":{"dur":4,"text":"And even more, trying to come up with ways\nto weasel out of your commitment,"},"607":{"dur":4,"text":"then worrying you'll be seen as an asshole\nfor bailing at the last minute."},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"And honestly?"},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"If you do bail at the last minute,"},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"having never intended\nto go in the first place,"},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"then you are an asshole."},"619":{"dur":1,"text":"And you should feel bad about it."},"621":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"Instead, pause;"},"625":{"dur":1,"text":"visualize;"},"627":{"dur":4,"text":"and say a timely, polite,\n\"No, thanks.
