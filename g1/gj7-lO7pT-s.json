the\nSecond World War, it did."},"100":{"dur":3,"text":"I think that what was very\nstriking in the early 1960s"},"103":{"dur":2,"text":"was that there was an\ninflux of mathematicians"},"106":{"dur":2,"text":"and natural scientists\ninto economics."},"108":{"dur":3,"text":"And people wrote highly\nmathematical treatises"},"112":{"dur":3,"text":"and the old idea

in the\n'60s, as a student,"},"129":{"dur":3,"text":"that people were constructing\ncomputer models of the economy"},"132":{"dur":3,"text":"and applying control\nengineering techniques to it"},"136":{"dur":1,"text":"to optimize the\npart of the economy."},"137":{"dur":2,"text":"So you'd choose interest\nrates and fiscal policy"},"140":{"dur":2,"text":"to optimize that\npart of the economy."},"142":{"dur":3,"text":"And this was a tremendous,\nexciting development."},"146":{"dur":1,"text":"And it all failed."},"147":{"dur":1,"text":"Completely failed."},"148":{"dur":3,"text":"And the reason is that there's\na fundamental importance--"},"151":{"dur":1,"text":"and I don't think\nit's fully been"},"153":{"dur":3,"text":"grasped since-- that there\nare no natural

the bank and says,"},"314":{"dur":1,"text":"terribly sorry, I'd\nlike all my money out,"},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"the bank can't then turn around\nto the people it's lent to"},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"and say, well, I know I said\nI'll lend to you for 10 years."},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"Actually, the people that I got\nthe money from have now come in"},"324":{"dur":1,"text":"and asked their money back."},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"So could you please\nrepay your loan tomorrow."},"328":{"dur":3,"text":"And even if they did try to ask\npeople to

dancing."},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"And within two or three\nmonths, the music had stopped"},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"and he lost his job."},"422":{"dur":1,"text":"But the interesting\npoint about

he'd"},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"said that, then Citibank\nwould have been much less"},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"profitable in the\nintervening five years,"},"451":{"dur":1,"text":"and he would probably\nhave been sacked"},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"before we even got to 2007."},"454":{"dur":0,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: Because\nthe shareholder"},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"expectation wouldn't be met."},"456":{"dur":1,"text":"MERVYN KING: All the\nother banks would"},"457":{"dur":1,"text":"have been earning\na lot of money,"},"459":{"dur":1,"text":"because they were taking risks."},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"So Keynes once said,\nJohn Maynard Keynes"},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"once said, that\nit doesn't matter"},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"what risks you take as a bank,\nprovided all the other banks"},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"are taking the same risks."},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"And there was a similar\nproblem for central banks,"},"473":{"dur":3,"text":"because there was this downward\nmovement of interest rates,"},"477":{"dur":3,"text":"which started really after\nthe fall of the Berlin Wall"},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"when, you know,\ncommunism was said"},"483":{"dur":1,"text":"to have lost out to capitalism."},"485":{"dur":1,"text":"Now we saw all this."},"487":{"dur":1,"text":"And in fact, at\nthe same time, what"},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"we saw with China\nand other countries"},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"embracing a market economy\nwas that the number of people"},"494":{"dur":3,"text":"working in the manufacturing\nsector around the world who"},"498":{"dur":3,"text":"wanted to export their\nproduction probably trebled."},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"And that was partly\nresponsible for keeping wages"},"503":{"dur":4,"text":"of most people at low levels, or\nat least no increases in wages."},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"But it also meant\nthat these countries"},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"that wanted to export a lot\nwere saving a vast amount."},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"They were saving far more\nthan we were willing to spend."},"516":{"dur":1,"text":"And so they were\nputting this money"},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"into the capital market\naround the world."},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"It was a global capital\nmarket for the first time."},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"And interest rates\ndetermined by the balance"},"525":{"dur":5,"text":"between saving and investment\nkept pushing rates down."},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"And that meant that countries\nlike the UK and the US"},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"were facing trade deficits,\nfor different reasons."},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"China, other countries\nin Asia, on the one hand,"},"540":{"dur":4,"text":"and Germany on the other,\nwanted trade surpluses."},"544":{"dur":4,"text":"That meant that they were saving\nmore than they were investing."},"549":{"dur":4,"text":"We were on the other side of\nthat, with a trade deficit,"},"553":{"dur":4,"text":"we were borrowing\nmore than we were--"},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"we had to borrow from\nthe rest of the world"},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"to finance the trade deficit."},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"And our debts were\nspiraling upwards."},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"And everyone thought that\nwe could go on doing this."},"569":{"dur":1,"text":"But in the end, we couldn't."},"571":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's really what brought\nabout the crisis in itself."},"575":{"dur":4,"text":"So the symptom of the crisis\nwas that the banking system"},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"through which these flows\nof savings and investment"},"581":{"dur":3,"text":"were mediated, the banking\nsystem itself had borrowed"},"585":{"dur":3,"text":"a lot of money, taken\nin more deposits,"},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"and became very fragile."},"590":{"dur":1,"text":"So there were many\nbanks that had what"},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"are called leverage ratios."},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"That is, how much has\nthe bank itself borrowed"},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"from other people\nrather than financed"},"599":{"dur":1,"text":"through its own shareholders."},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"That was 50 to 1,\nwhich meant that if you"},"604":{"dur":4,"text":"had a bank with, say,\n$100 million of assets,"},"608":{"dur":4,"text":"you only had to have a fall\nin the value of those assets"},"612":{"dur":3,"text":"on average by 2% to mean\nthe bank was literally bust,"},"616":{"dur":0,"text":"insolvent."},"617":{"dur":1,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: So with\nthat 50 to 1 ratio,"},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"would the healthy\namount be 1 to 1?"},"620":{"dur":1,"text":"Is that the ideal?"},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"MERVYN KING: I don't think we\nknow what the ideal ratio is."},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is where\nexpectations come back,"},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"why this isn't an\nengineering phenomenon."},"628":{"dur":3,"text":"So ask yourself the\nquestion, how much money"},"631":{"dur":4,"text":"does a bank need to finance\nitself through equity in order"},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"to persuade other people that\nit's safe to lend to the bank,"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"and they can attract funds\nand do their business."},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"Before the crisis,\nwe know the answer"},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"to that, which is hardly any."},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"Because banks were able\nto get lots of money"},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"from elsewhere with\nvery little equity."},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"Immediately after the\ncrisis, the answer"},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"to that same question\nwas a hell of a lot,"},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"because people suddenly thought,\nGod, banks aren't safe anymore."},"659":{"dur":3,"text":"And the innocence of the\nbanking system was lost."},"662":{"dur":3,"text":"And the regulators really\nplayed no part in any of this."},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"This swing in sentiment\nfrom being wildly"},"668":{"dur":1,"text":"optimistic about\nwhat banks could"},"670":{"dur":3,"text":"do to being\nextremely pessimistic"},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"was a change in sentiment."},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"You couldn't claim that it\nwas obviously irrational"},"677":{"dur":1,"text":"in any way."},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"People were trying to cope\nwith an unknowable future."},"681":{"dur":1,"text":"They made this judgment."},"683":{"dur":3,"text":"And that is the danger with\nthe banking system, where"},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"if people can't get their\nmoney out and know that maybe"},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"if the bank is fragile they\ncan't get their money out,"},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"then they may be tempted to run."},"694":{"dur":4,"text":"And what happened in New York\nin September, October 2008,"},"698":{"dur":3,"text":"it wasn't that ordinary people,\nordinary depositors queued up"},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"outside the bank to\nget their money out."},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"It was wholesale depositors."},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"That is, financial institutions."},"709":{"dur":1,"text":"Money market funds."},"710":{"dur":0,"text":"Hedge funds."},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"All said to\nthemselves, these banks"},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"aren't as safe as we\nthought, we get our money out"},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"as soon as we can."},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"And that was the run\non the banking system"},"719":{"dur":3,"text":"that reached its peak in\nNew York in that period."},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: So you mentioned\nthe normal day-to-day"},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"depositors, the you and I.

I\ndon't think we should go"},"736":{"dur":3,"text":"into this with blaming people."},"740":{"dur":3,"text":"I think ordinary people\nare right to be angry."},"743":{"dur":1,"text":"But the reason they're\nright to be angry"},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"is because of a collective\nfailure of thinking and ideas,"},"747":{"dur":3,"text":"rather than the behavior\nof any one

crisis."},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"It was much deeper\nforces than that."},"762":{"dur":1,"text":"The difference\nbetween what happened"},"764":{"dur":4,"text":"in 2008 and the early 1930s\nin the Great Depression"},"768":{"dur":2,"text":"is that central\nbanks and governments"},"771":{"dur":3,"text":"in the latter instance,\nin 2008, expanded demand,"},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"cut interest rates, to prevent\na big rise in unemployment."},"778":{"dur":1,"text":"And that worked."},"779":{"dur":4,"text":"However, that kind\nof policy stimulus"},"784":{"dur":2,"text":"is a bit like a

see"},"805":{"dur":4,"text":"was, well, yes, we didn't see\na massive rise in unemployment."},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"We did see a considerable\nrise, but it was"},"812":{"dur":4,"text":"muted compared with the 1930s."},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"But we don't see a recovery."},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"We haven't got back to\nwhere we should have been."},"821":{"dur":4,"text":"In fact, I would reckon\nthat

number."},"833":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's an enormous\ncost of this crisis."},"837":{"dur":3,"text":"And therefore, there are\ntwo conclusions from that,"},"841":{"dur":3,"text":"One is that this\nshows the potential"},"844":{"dur":3,"text":"for rapid growth in the future,\nif we do tackle the underlying"},"848":{"dur":2,"text":"symptoms."},"850":{"dur":3,"text":"And secondly, it shows

done."},"859":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think it's been compounded\nby the fact that, certainly"},"862":{"dur":2,"text":"in the US and the\nUK, that people"},"865":{"dur":4,"text":"were taught that a
