{"1":{"dur":2,"text":"Today's video is an altered art project"},"4":{"dur":3,"text":"and for this, I am altering a Yankee Candle reed diffuser bottle."},"7":{"dur":3,"text":"To begin with I'm going to create a textured surface on the bottle"},"14":{"dur":2,"text":"so I've torn up some tissue paper"},"16":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'm going to adhere that to the bottle using Golden's Soft Gel Medium."},"19":{"dur":4,"text":"I've chosen a soft gel as it's stronger than a fluid matt medium"},"23":{"dur":3,"text":"and although it's not as strong as a regular gel,"},"26":{"dur":3,"text":"the soft gel's not as thick, so it's easier to work with,"},"30":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's the bottle totally covered"},"34":{"dur":4,"text":"and I also decided to add some of this decorative tissue paper"},"39":{"dur":2,"text":"just to add a little bit of interest."},"41":{"dur":2,"text":"A lot of this does get covered up eventually,"},"43":{"dur":3,"text":"but I wasn't too sure at this stage how much would get covered up"},"47":{"dur":6,"text":"so I wanted to make sure there was something of interest other than the plain tissue on the bottle"},"68":{"dur":2,"text":"Now I'm going to add some colour to the bottle"},"72":{"dur":3,"text":"and for this, I've selected Silks Acrylic Glazes"},"76":{"dur":3,"text":"in four different colours, although I actually only end up using 3 of these colours,"},"80":{"dur":2,"text":"the two blues and the lime green"},"82":{"dur":3,"text":"And I've chosen glazes because of their transparent nature"},"85":{"dur":3,"text":"so you are going to be able to see the pattern on that music paper"},"89":{"dur":5,"text":"The first colour that I'm covering the bottle completely with is the lighter blue."},"94":{"dur":1,"text":"This is Mediterranean Blue"},"118":{"dur":3,"text":"And the second colour I'm using here is the darker blue"},"122":{"dur":1,"text":"and this is Majestic Blue"},"131":{"dur":2,"text":"And finally, this is the Key Lime"},"134":{"dur":4,"text":"And then I go back with each of the colours again and just blend them through"},"146":{"dur":2,"text":"This is Pearlescent White by Lumiere"},"149":{"dur":3,"text":"and I'm using this to add some softness to the piece"},"153":{"dur":2,"text":"and to bring some highlights to it"},"179":{"dur":1,"text":"Now I want to age the bottle"},"181":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'm using Basics, Raw Umber"},"183":{"dur":1,"text":"And, this looks quite dramatic at first"},"185":{"dur":3,"text":"painting a layer of watered down paint all over the bottle"},"188":{"dur":4,"text":"But as you can see, I'm wiping most of it off with a baby wipe"},"193":{"dur":2,"text":"So that the dark brown colour"},"195":{"dur":3,"text":"Is only left in the crevices of the texture"},"198":{"dur":2,"text":"from the tissue paper"},"218":{"dur":4,"text":"The next thing I want to do is create some embellishments for the bottle"},"223":{"dur":1,"text":"so I'm using Premo by Sculpey"},"225":{"dur":2,"text":"and a hummingbird flexible mould"},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"This is from bestflexiblemoulds.com"},"230":{"dur":3,"text":"And I show the process of putting the clay into the mould"},"234":{"dur":1,"text":"I have been asked about this before"},"235":{"dur":3,"text":"So I tend to put a piece, a little oversized into the mould"},"239":{"dur":2,"text":"squeeze it in as much as I can, and then"},"242":{"dur":3,"text":"use a flexible blade to shave off the excess"},"245":{"dur":3,"text":"until it's flush with the top of the mould"},"249":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I usually put it into the fridge for a little while"},"252":{"dur":2,"text":"and that makes it easier to take it out"},"254":{"dur":1,"text":"without distorting the shape"},"256":{"dur":3,"text":"Then once they've been taken out of the mould,"},"259":{"dur":1,"text":"I bake them on a ceramic tile"},"261":{"dur":3,"text":"for about 15 minutes for little pieces like this"},"264":{"dur":2,"text":"and here they are, once they've been taken out"},"277":{"dur":2,"text":"Now I'm going to add some colour to the pieces"},"281":{"dur":2,"text":"I've chosen two Liquitex Basics paints"},"284":{"dur":2,"text":"in crimson and cadmium yellow"},"287":{"dur":3,"text":"and I add two coats of the paint"},"291":{"dur":3,"text":"Although you actually only see me apply one coat here"},"296":{"dur":2,"text":"The first coat tends to seep into the clay"},"299":{"dur":2,"text":"and is not particularly bright"},"301":{"dur":1,"text":"because clay is a porous surface"},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"so that's the reason for adding two coats"},"305":{"dur":3,"text":"and I'm just using a detail brush by Art Master"},"309":{"dur":2,"text":"and a pair of tweezers to hold them"},"312":{"dur":3,"text":"since they are particularly small and fiddly pieces"},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"and they do want to move around a great deal"},"370":{"dur":2,"text":"And once the flowers have been painted"},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"I start to paint the little hummingbirds"},"375":{"dur":1,"text":"and I moulded"},"376":{"dur":2,"text":"four humingbirds in total for this project"},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"so I'm just going to show you one of them"},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"This again, is Liquitex basics paint"},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"in Light Green Permanent to begin with"},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"And now I'm going back to the crimson colour"},"399":{"dur":2,"text":"the same crimson that I used on the flowers"},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"and also the Lumiere"},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"Pearlescent white that I used on the bottle"},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"at the very start of the video"},"412":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is Lumiere Halo Blue Gold"},"416":{"dur":5,"text":"and this is so I can add that irridescence that hummingbirds have to their wings"},"423":{"dur":5,"text":"And you'll also notice that the hummingbird's beak and eye have been coloured"},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"with some black which I did off camera"},"453":{"dur":3,"text":"And whilst I'm waiting for those clay pieces to dry"},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm taking some Junkyard Findings by Prima"},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"These are the Rose Heart Corners"},"463":{"dur":4,"text":"and I'm going to paint these with the Lumiere Pearlescent White"},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"to match other elements of the project"},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"This is Brilliant Yellow Green from Basics"},"499":{"dur":1,"text":"and these are little leaves"},"501":{"dur":4,"text":"from the same mould as the flowers and hummingbirds"},"506":{"dur":4,"text":"and just like those elements they're getting two coats of this paint"},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"And now back to the Prima pieces"},"519":{"dur":5,"text":"and I'm aging these in the same way that I did the bottle at the start of the video"},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"So I've just applied a layer of brown paint"},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"thats been watered down slightly"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"brushing it into all the crevices"},"532":{"dur":3,"text":"and then dabbing it off with a baby wipe"},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"so that it is only left in some areas"},"538":{"dur":5,"text":"And I apply the same aging technique to all the clay elements in the project"},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"Now I'm using Glossy Accents by Ranger"},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"to adhere the Prima pieces down"},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"And I've chosen Glossy Accents"},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"over something like a hot glue because"},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"you have time to manipulate the pieces before it dries"},"569":{"dur":1,"text":"Now back to the leaves"},"571":{"dur":3,"text":"and I'm just adding a little bit of the Lumiere paint"},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"to darken them a little bit"},"577":{"dur":1,"text":"and to add some irridescence"},"598":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, I decide to add some of the Brilliant Yellow Green"},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"onto the leaves of the Prima pieces"},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's what you can see me doing here"},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"and again, I add two coats of this paint"},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"Next, I'm using Ranger Glossy Accents again"},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"to adhere the little clay embellishments that I've made"},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"onto the bottle and form my design"},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"Once the Glossy Accents has had time to set"},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going back to the Silks Paints"},"728":{"dur":1,"text":"This is the Majestic Blue"},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'm going to start to add some shadows"},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"underneath the clay embellishments"},"736":{"dur":3,"text":"So, as I say, I'm starting off here with the Majestic Blue"},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"which was the darkest of the two blues"},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"I used at the start of the project on the bottle"},"745":{"dur":4,"text":"Then, later on, I use Golden's Fluid Acrylic in Payne's Grey"},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"just to add the very darkest areas of shadow"},"847":{"dur":3,"text":"Now that the front of the bottle is complete"},"850":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm going to work on a design on the back of the bottle"},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I'm using the same elements as before"},"856":{"dur":1,"text":"Some of the Prima pieces"},"859":{"dur":4,"text":"and also the clay embellishments that I made from the mould"},"1034":{"dur":2,"text":"Now I have both sides of the bottle complete"},"1037":{"dur":2,"text":"with the clay embellishments and design"},"1040":{"dur":3,"text":"I decided to add a border"},"1043":{"dur":3,"text":"or frame, around the sides of the bottle"},"1046":{"dur":2,"text":"using Payne's Grey"},"1087":{"dur":4,"text":"Now I'm adding some of the clay flowers and leaves to the sides of the bottle"},"1092":{"dur":3,"text":"so that no matter what angle you are viewing the bottle"},"1096":{"dur":1,"text":"when it's on display"},"1097":{"dur":2,"text":"there will be some area of interest"},"1099":{"dur":2,"text":"and it is fully embellished"},"1128":{"dur":2,"text":"For the final part of the project"},"1131":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm adding some fibres around the neck of the bottle"},"1133":{"dur":4,"text":"in shades of blue that compliment the rest of the project"},"1153":{"dur":2,"text":"And here is the finished bottle"},"1155":{"dur":4,"text":"I hope you enjoyed watching the process as much as I did creating it"},"1161":{"dur":4,"text":"There'll be a link to the full materials list in the video description"},"1165":{"dur":2,"text":"and if you click \"show more\""},"1167":{"dur":2,"text":"you'll find both the link to the project materials"},"1170":{"dur":2,"text":"as well as my social media links"},"1172":{"dur":1,"text":"so if you wanted to follow me"},"1174":{"dur":4,"text":"on my blog or Ustream,
