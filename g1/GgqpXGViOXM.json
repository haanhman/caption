role"},"707":{"dur":4,"text":"that that picture has played\nin our popular culture."},"712":{"dur":4,"text":"And when I was starting to think\nabout the legacy of Tiananmen"},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"in

are\n650 million Chinese people"},"731":{"dur":0,"text":"online."},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"And although the internet\nis very heavily censored,"},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"there's a lot that gets through."},"736":{"dur":3,"text":"It's quite a leaky system,\nand a lot of young people"},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"know how to circumvent\nthe censorship."},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"So one of the\nexperiments that I did"},"744":{"dur":4,"text":"was to take this picture,\nthe picture of Tank Man,"},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"around four Beijing\nuniversities."},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"And they were the\nfour universities"},"754":{"dur":4,"text":"that were most instrumental\nin 1989 in the protests."},"758":{"dur":3,"text":"And I asked students do\nyou recognize this image?"},"762":{"dur":1,"text":"And if they said\nyes, I would double"},"764":{"dur":4,"text":"check with them to see if they\nreally did know what it was."},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"And I remember in this room\n100% of people knew this image."},"772":{"dur":4,"text":"I was really surprised to\nfind only 15% of the students"},"777":{"dur":3,"text":"that I talked could\nidentify this image."},"781":{"dur":3,"text":"And you may ask, well, how can\nyou tell if people are lying?"},"784":{"dur":1,"text":"And that was something\nthat I didn't"},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"know when I started whether\nI would be able to tell."},"789":{"dur":1,"text":"And it was really\nsurprising to me"},"791":{"dur":2,"text":"that you can\nimmediately tell because"},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"of the power of the image."},"795":{"dur":5,"text":"Those students who knew\nwhat that image was,"},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"they have this\nphysical reaction."},"803":{"dur":1,"text":"They would look at\nthe picture, and they"},"805":{"dur":2,"text":"would shy away from it."},"808":{"dur":1,"text":"Some of them gasped."},"809":{"dur":3,"text":"One of them said, oh my god."},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was clear if\nthey knew what it was."},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, there was one\nyoung man who even said,"},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"I do not know what this image\nis, but it's too controversial"},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"and I can't talk\nto you about it."},"823":{"dur":1,"text":"So he knew."},"824":{"dur":4,"text":"Whilst the 85 students I\nspoke to who couldn't identify"},"828":{"dur":1,"text":"the image, when they\nlooked at it, when"},"830":{"dur":3,"text":"they looked at the Tank Man\npicture, they would lean in."},"833":{"dur":1,"text":"And they would point to things."},"835":{"dur":1,"text":"And they would ask questions."},"836":{"dur":3,"text":"So I was asked is\nit South Korea?"},"839":{"dur":2,"text":"Is it Kosovo?"},"842":{"dur":2,"text":"One student pointed\nat the lamppost, which"},"844":{"dur":5,"text":"is really distinctive-- they're\nonly in Tiananmen Square--"},"849":{"dur":3,"text":"and said well, it really\nlooks like Tiananmen,"},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"but it can't be."},"855":{"dur":8,"text":"So it was clear that although\nthe censorship is leaky,"},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"that it is actually\nworking when it comes"},"866":{"dur":2,"text":"to a large proportion\nof people in China"},"869":{"dur":2,"text":"and young people in China."},"871":{"dur":2,"text":"Those students who did\nknow what the picture was,"},"874":{"dur":5,"text":"often they would defend the\nbehavior of the government."},"879":{"dur":5,"text":"And they would say things\nlike China's economic progress"},"885":{"dur":4,"text":"in the last 30 years was only\npossible because of the actions"},"889":{"dur":3,"text":"that the government took\nin Tiananmen Square."},"893":{"dur":3,"text":"So it was really a\nretrospective

line as well."},"905":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's a line which\na lot of Chinese people"},"909":{"dur":4,"text":"both believe in and agree with."},"913":{"dur":5,"text":"So actually 19 of\nthe students that I"},"919":{"dur":4,"text":"spoke to believe that it was a\nmilitary parade, this picture."},"923":{"dur":3,"text":"Because they just couldn't\nconceive of any other reason"},"927":{"dur":2,"text":"why there would be tanks\nrunning down that road."},"930":{"dur":2,"text":"So that was one of the\nthings that I discovered."},"932":{"dur":2,"text":"And the other thing\nthat I discovered"},"934":{"dur":4,"text":"was how nervous it\nmade me walking around"},"939":{"dur":2,"text":"university campuses with\nthis Tank Man picture."},"942":{"dur":1,"text":"And I was really\nsurprised by that."},"943":{"dur":3,"text":"Because at that stage I'd\nbeen a journalist in China"},"947":{"dur":1,"text":"for more than 10 years."},"949":{"dur":2,"text":"And let's be honest."},"952":{"dur":1,"text":"I had a license."},"953":{"dur":3,"text":"I had a literal license, a\njournalist card in my pocket"},"956":{"dur":3,"text":"which allowed me to go and\nask sensitive

walking\naround with a photograph asking"},"973":{"dur":3,"text":"questions was making me\nreally paranoid and scared."},"977":{"dur":4,"text":"And I also realized if I, who\nhad a license to be doing this,"},"982":{"dur":2,"text":"if I was so nervous,\nwhat was it like"},"984":{"dur":4,"text":"for ordinary Chinese people\nwho I was talking to you?"},"989":{"dur":2,"text":"So it really made me

of the reasons."},"1000":{"dur":3,"text":"If you search on\nGoogle for Tiananmen,"},"1004":{"dur":4,"text":"you will get immediately\npictures of Tank Man."},"1008":{"dur":3,"text":"You'll get the
