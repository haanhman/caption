Google,"},"42":{"dur":3,"text":"since I live on Google."},"45":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a researcher's dream to\nbe able to Google everything"},"48":{"dur":0,"text":"instantly."},"49":{"dur":1,"text":"You don't understand\nsomething, Google it."},"51":{"dur":2,"text":"Understand something, Google it."},"53":{"dur":1,"text":"I remember one of my\nmentors a long time"},"55":{"dur":2,"text":"ago was saying that if, when\nyou're speaking, if you use one"},"58":{"dur":3,"text":"word that somebody\ncan't understand,"},"61":{"dur":2,"text":"then they tend to blank out\non everything else you say."},"64":{"dur":1,"text":"And one of the great\nthings for Google for me"},"66":{"dur":1,"text":"is I'll be reading\nresearch and this and this,"},"68":{"dur":1,"text":"and if a word comes\nalong I don't understand,"},"69":{"dur":2,"text":"I can immediately Google\nthat and come back."},"72":{"dur":1,"text":"Because to truly\nunderstand something,"},"74":{"dur":2,"text":"you have to actually\nunderstand every word."},"76":{"dur":2,"text":"But we intuitively think we're\ngoing to get it at the end,"},"79":{"dur":1,"text":"but we don't."},"81":{"dur":1,"text":"So in my message on\n\"Men Are from Mars,"},"83":{"dur":3,"text":"Women Are from Venus,\" what's so\nmuch fun for me is, typically,"},"86":{"dur":2,"text":"people can relate\nto the examples"},"89":{"dur":2,"text":"from your own\npersonal experience."},"91":{"dur":1,"text":"So just to know you a\nlittle bit as my audience"},"93":{"dur":4,"text":"so I give the right talk, who\nhas read \"Men Are from Mars,"},"97":{"dur":0,"text":"Women Are from Venus\"?"},"98":{"dur":1,"text":"How many of you read it?"},"100":{"dur":1,"text":"So a lot of you haven't."},"101":{"dur":3,"text":"OK, now, how many of you who\nhaven't have heard of it?"},"105":{"dur":2,"text":"So your parents read it, right?"},"108":{"dur":1,"text":"That was when I knew\nI was getting old,"},"109":{"dur":0,"text":"when people would\ncome up and they'd go,"},"110":{"dur":2,"text":"oh, I love your book,\nand my parents read it."},"115":{"dur":1,"text":"They started going\non walks together."},"117":{"dur":2,"text":"They actually are so\nmuch happier afterwards,"},"119":{"dur":0,"text":"so they thank me."},"120":{"dur":1,"text":"And I said, well,\nwhen you get ready,"},"121":{"dur":1,"text":"you'll probably want\nto read the book, too."},"123":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm going to give-- for those\nof you haven't read \"Men Are"},"126":{"dur":2,"text":"from Mars\"-- some of the basic\nideas of that in our short"},"128":{"dur":2,"text":"presentation, and we'll\nalso have room for question"},"131":{"dur":1,"text":"and answers, if you\nlike to ask questions."},"132":{"dur":3,"text":"I'll also briefly talk about\nmy most recent book, which"},"136":{"dur":3,"text":"is called \"Work with Me,\"\nwhich is about 25 books later."},"139":{"dur":2,"text":"I've applied the\nprinciples of understanding"},"142":{"dur":3,"text":"gender differences\nin a positive way."},"145":{"dur":1,"text":"Because so much of the\ntime, when men and women"},"147":{"dur":2,"text":"show up differently\nin a relationship,"},"150":{"dur":3,"text":"we often have an intuitive\nreaction, which is wrong."},"153":{"dur":2,"text":"How many of you have read the\nbook called \"Slow Thinker, Fast"},"156":{"dur":1,"text":"Thinker\"?"},"157":{"dur":2,"text":"It was a good book,\nbut it talks about most"},"159":{"dur":3,"text":"of our interpretation\nof reality is automatic,"},"163":{"dur":2,"text":"kind of like I know that that\nbuilding's quite far away,"},"165":{"dur":1,"text":"and you're closer to me."},"167":{"dur":2,"text":"And when we're in relationships,\nwhen our partners say or do"},"170":{"dur":2,"text":"things, we have an\nautomatic interpretation,"},"172":{"dur":3,"text":"which is often\nwrong, particularly"},"175":{"dur":2,"text":"when it's the opposite sex."},"178":{"dur":2,"text":"So a lot of my ideas,\nI think the popularity"},"180":{"dur":1,"text":"of \"Men Are from Mars\"\nwas that you really"},"182":{"dur":2,"text":"don't have to do\nanything to change"},"184":{"dur":2,"text":"your relationship to the better."},"186":{"dur":1,"text":"Because so many of the\nproblems that couples"},"188":{"dur":3,"text":"have in relationships\nis misinterpretation."},"192":{"dur":2,"text":"And so if you can start\nto interpret a situation"},"194":{"dur":2,"text":"correctly, you find\nout the problem"},"197":{"dur":2,"text":"is not as big as\nyou thought it was."},"199":{"dur":2,"text":"There's an old\nEastern Indian story"},"202":{"dur":3,"text":"of the person who sees a snake\non the ground, and it's dark,"},"205":{"dur":3,"text":"and they start yelling and\nscreaming, snake, snake."},"208":{"dur":3,"text":"And somebody turns on the\nlight, and it's a stick."},"211":{"dur":2,"text":"So so many of the problems\nI see with my couples"},"214":{"dur":2,"text":"as a marriage counselor\nare big problems to them,"},"217":{"dur":2,"text":"and then I explain it to\nthem, and it's a stick,"},"219":{"dur":2,"text":"and then you can\nwork with the stick."},"222":{"dur":3,"text":"So in \"Work with Me\"--\nthat's the second book"},"225":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll be briefly talking about."},"226":{"dur":2,"text":"That's my most recent\npublished book."},"229":{"dur":2,"text":"It talks about gender\ndifferences in the workplace,"},"232":{"dur":3,"text":"and how are these basic blind\nspots between men and women."},"235":{"dur":2,"text":"And we teach through\nhuman resources"},"238":{"dur":0,"text":"in different companies."},"239":{"dur":3,"text":"We go in, and we do these\nworkshops sometimes."},"242":{"dur":4,"text":"And we did a survey of\nover 100,000 men and women"},"247":{"dur":2,"text":"So they filled out this survey\nbefore they took the course."},"250":{"dur":2,"text":"And we found that there are\nthese basic blind spots."},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"There's eight that I focus\non, but I'll mention one"},"255":{"dur":4,"text":"right now, which is\nwe asked the women,"},"259":{"dur":2,"text":"do you feel appreciated\nin the workplace?"},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"And over half of the\nwomen felt they were not"},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"being appreciated by men."},"268":{"dur":2,"text":"And then we ask the men,\ndo you appreciate women"},"271":{"dur":1,"text":"in the workplace?"},"272":{"dur":4,"text":"And over 90% of men\nsaid, of course."},"277":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's a blind spot."},"279":{"dur":3,"text":"Men think that they're\ncommunicating appreciation,"},"282":{"dur":3,"text":"but women often not\nfeeling appreciated."},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"And this gives rise to one\nof the basic differences"},"288":{"dur":3,"text":"between men and women, which\nis that women feel valued"},"291":{"dur":3,"text":"and appreciated when\nyou know what they do."},"295":{"dur":3,"text":"When a man gets paid, get\nacknowledged for the result--"},"299":{"dur":3,"text":"good job, you did this, now you\nget this promotion or whatever."},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"That makes a man feel\nvalued and appreciated."},"305":{"dur":1,"text":"Acknowledge what I do."},"307":{"dur":3,"text":"But for a woman, she wants to be\nacknowledged for what she does,"},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"but she also wants to be seen."},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"She wants to be heard."},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"She wants to be understood."},"317":{"dur":2,"text":"And this was my first insight\ninto the world of \"Men Are from"},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"Mars, Women Are from\nVenus\"-- what was it--"},"322":{"dur":3,"text":"over 30 years ago."},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"Before I realized it, before\nI was even married to my wife."},"328":{"dur":1,"text":"We've been married 28 years."},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"But Helen is my\nassistant 30 years ago."},"333":{"dur":2,"text":"And Helen comes to me and\nsays she wants to quit."},"335":{"dur":1,"text":"And I said, why would\nyou want to quit?"},"337":{"dur":0,"text":"You're the best."},"338":{"dur":1,"text":"I just gave you a raise."},"339":{"dur":2,"text":"You make as much\nas me, basically."},"341":{"dur":3,"text":"And she said, it's\nnot about the money."},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"I just don't feel appreciated."},"348":{"dur":0,"text":"And I said, all right."},"349":{"dur":1,"text":"Why don't you feel appreciated?"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"Because I thought she\nwas a gift from heaven."},"354":{"dur":4,"text":"And she said, well, John, you\ndon't even know what I do."},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"And my reaction as\na man was, that's"},"360":{"dur":3,"text":"why I appreciate you so much."},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"And we laugh because we\ncan see the logic of that."},"366":{"dur":0,"text":"I don't have to think."},"367":{"dur":0,"text":"I don't have to plan."},"368":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't have to do anything."},"369":{"dur":1,"text":"She made all the arrangements."},"371":{"dur":1,"text":"She put the money in the bank."},"372":{"dur":1,"text":"She organized my seminars."},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"She handled all my clients."},"376":{"dur":3,"text":"I just showed up at work and\ncounseled eight women today."},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"Which, by the way, when \"Men\nAre from Mars\" came out,"},"381":{"dur":2,"text":"everybody was so upset at me."},"384":{"dur":0,"text":"Some people still are."},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"I said, well, my\ncredentials, basically,"},"388":{"dur":2,"text":"as a counselor-- how many\nmen have sat in a room"},"391":{"dur":3,"text":"and listened to women talk for\neight hours a day for 10 years?"},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"You have to get paid a lot\nof money to do that job."},"403":{"dur":4,"text":"So I said to her, just\nlet me-- she said,"},"408":{"dur":1,"text":"you don't even know what I do."},"410":{"dur":1,"text":"And so I caught on very quickly."},"411":{"dur":3,"text":"I said, well, give me\na week, and let's see."},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"So Helen continued to\nwork for me for years."},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"I just celebrated her birthday\nwith her just recently."},"418":{"dur":4,"text":"And all I did differently--\nand Helen stayed with me"},"423":{"dur":1,"text":"and felt valued\nand appreciated--"},"425":{"dur":5,"text":"was I took five extra minutes\na day to find out what she did."},"430":{"dur":4,"text":"And once I knew what she did,\nthen she felt part of a team."},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"Very important for women\nto feel part of a team,"},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"not to feel isolated."},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"Second thing is she\nfelt seen, and that I"},"442":{"dur":3,"text":"come in and actually\nlook at her."},"446":{"dur":4,"text":"If you're a programmer, an\nengineer brain, you're a guy,"},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"eye contact is not\nso important for you."},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"But to women, it is."},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"Watch women talk, they'll\nbe looking at each other,"},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"whereas guys could be looking\noff or looking down or looking"},"459":{"dur":1,"text":"around, sometimes\nlooking at each other,"},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"but always when there's a point."},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're talking\nsocial talk with guys,"},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"we have to be looking at a\nfootball game or a computer"},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"screen."},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"It was just the other\nnight, I was at a party"},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"with one of my old friends\nwho was sitting next to me."},"475":{"dur":1,"text":"And my wife is\nsitting over here."},"476":{"dur":1,"text":"Actually, it was\nHelen's birthday,"},"478":{"dur":1,"text":"and she's sitting in front."},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'm talking to\nMartin, his name is,"},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"and my wife points out\nto me 3\/4 of the way"},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"into the evening,\nJohn, you're not"},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"looking at Martin when you talk."},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"You need to look at him."},"493":{"dur":1,"text":"I said, OK, honey."},"494":{"dur":0,"text":"I looked at Martin."},"495":{"dur":3,"text":"He didn't even notice either."},"499":{"dur":3,"text":"So what I focus on is\nthe little differences"},"502":{"dur":1,"text":"between men and women."},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not like a woman\ncan't do what a man does."},"505":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not that a man can't\ndo what a woman does."},"507":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's not that all men and\nall women fit into these slots"},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"so neatly."},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"Generally, about\n10% of men will tend"},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"to relate more the\nfemale examples."},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"10% of women will relate\nmore to the male examples."},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"Women often come up\nto me and say, gee,"},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"I feel like I'm from Mars."},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"And I say, well,\nthat's conditioning,"},"524":{"dur":1,"text":"to a great extent."},"526":{"dur":1,"text":"Women today are\nconditioned to be like men,"},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"and there's no\nsafety to acknowledge"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"feminine aspects of who you are."},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"And part of my message\nis to validate that,"},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"but not to negate if you're\nmore on your masculine side."},"537":{"dur":0,"text":"That's great."},"538":{"dur":3,"text":"That allows you to\noften fit into the work"},"541":{"dur":1,"text":"world much better."},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"And women will say to me\nafter they read my book,"},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"they say, yeah, I feel\nlike I've become a man"},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"to become successful, and I'm\nvery confused when I get home."},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"It's like I feel split."},"552":{"dur":4,"text":"So I wrote a book, which is\ncalled \"Why Mars and Venus"},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"Collide\" before I\nwrote this book."},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"And \"Why Mars and\nVenus Collide\" is--"},"562":{"dur":5,"text":"what's happening today is that\nwomen go into the workplace."},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"The workplace stimulates\ncertain hormones."},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, that hormone is the\nhormone is the hormone that"},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"gets produced when\nyou're solving problems"},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"and particularly when you\nhave a responsibility,"},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's all up to you, and\nyou're solving a problem."},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, what hormone would that be?"},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"That hormone is\ncalled testosterone."},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"It's the emergency hormone."},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"It's the hormone when\nyou feel pressured,"},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"when you feel a sense\nof got to go fast."},"591":{"dur":1,"text":"Got to get this done."},"592":{"dur":0,"text":"It's up to me."},"593":{"dur":1,"text":"Nobody else is going to do it."},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"Or you sacrifice because\nit's a difficult thing,"},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"but you say, I can handle\nit, because I'm getting paid,"},"600":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's my job."},"602":{"dur":1,"text":"That's the hormone\nonly gets produced."},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"It's testosterone."},"605":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, the difference between a\nwoman's body and a man's body"},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"is hormonal."},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"These are real\nphysiological differences."},"614":{"dur":4,"text":"The average male\nneeds 30 times more"},"619":{"dur":3,"text":"testosterone to\nbe in a good

problems."},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"A man has one year before\nhis first heart attack."},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"This is a statistical fact."},"668":{"dur":1,"text":"So a statistical fact."},"670":{"dur":1,"text":"Not every man."},"671":{"dur":1,"text":"But men need to work."},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"Men need to go out there\nand solve problems,"},"675":{"dur":3,"text":"because
