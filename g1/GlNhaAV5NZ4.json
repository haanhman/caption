I mentioned"},"830":{"dur":6,"text":"in the introduction you are one of the people\nwho has brought it into the quantitative era?"},"836":{"dur":6,"text":"STEVE: I have always been interested in how\nvolcanoes work, in the physics of volcanoes"},"843":{"dur":7,"text":"and why they erupt when they erupt, I have\nbeen interested in understanding the flow"},"850":{"dur":6,"text":"processes.

And one of\nthe strands of research that has kept me occupied"},"971":{"dur":7,"text":"over the last ten or 15 years looking at the\nstatistics of volcanic eruptions. What we"},"978":{"dur":6,"text":"can do is, we can look back at the historical\nrecord of volcanoes and the geological record"},"985":{"dur":7,"text":"of volcanoes, which takes us much further\nback in time. Then we can look at that data"},"992":{"dur":7,"text":"and we can ask the question how often does\na volcano like Yellowstone erupt in the world."},"1000":{"dur":7,"text":"It is quite reassuring because the answer\nis that an eruption that formed the Yellowstone"},"1008":{"dur":6,"text":"caldera, which is a gigantic crater, probably\nhappens on the earth every 30,000 years or"},"1015":{"dur":7,"text":"so.

I think"},"1052":{"dur":7,"text":"what is a more interesting question is this:\nas you go down in size you go up in frequency,"},"1060":{"dur":9,"text":"so if you go to an eruption which is tentimes\nless than Yellowstone, then you start to get"},"1069":{"dur":5,"text":"into the sorts of eruptions which maybe we\nshould be worrying about in the same way we're"},"1075":{"dur":3,"text":"worrying about meteorites coming into the\nearth and causing problems."},"1078":{"dur":5,"text":"JIM: The same probabilities?\nSTEVE: That's right.
