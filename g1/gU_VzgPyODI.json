{"14":{"dur":2,"text":"Dr. Wall, thanks for joining me."},"16":{"dur":0,"text":"My pleasure."},"17":{"dur":3,"text":"So this Child X, this\nis your brain child."},"20":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a really\nexciting conference."},"22":{"dur":3,"text":"What gave you the\nidea to create this?"},"25":{"dur":2,"text":"Many of my colleagues\nin pediatrics"},"28":{"dur":2,"text":"have recognized,\nmyself included,"},"30":{"dur":3,"text":"the lack of a pediatrics\ninnovation conference,"},"34":{"dur":4,"text":"and that it's a really important\nunmet need in the field,"},"39":{"dur":2,"text":"that we have to have a\nway to bring together"},"41":{"dur":2,"text":"key thinkers of cross\ndisciplinary nature"},"44":{"dur":4,"text":"who can collectively define the\nmajor health problems we face"},"49":{"dur":3,"text":"with child and maternal\nhealth and the desire"},"52":{"dur":1,"text":"to fill that unmet need."},"54":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think the third thing\nis really the uniqueness"},"57":{"dur":3,"text":"that Stanford has with\nrespect to interdisciplinary"},"61":{"dur":4,"text":"collaboration across\nthe medical school,"},"66":{"dur":2,"text":"but also across the campus\ninto humanities and sciences"},"68":{"dur":3,"text":"and biodesign and other things."},"71":{"dur":2,"text":"Do we need to innovate\ndifferently for children?"},"74":{"dur":2,"text":"I think a lot of the talks\nthat we've heard today"},"77":{"dur":2,"text":"have really stressed that point."},"79":{"dur":3,"text":"Things that we do in\nadults don't work in kids"},"82":{"dur":3,"text":"and there's lots of good\nreasons for that-- mechanistic,"},"86":{"dur":1,"text":"biological,\nphysiological reasons,"},"87":{"dur":3,"text":"but practical reasons,\nlike they won't"},"91":{"dur":3,"text":"sit in an MRI for 90 minutes."},"94":{"dur":4,"text":"Those sorts of things\nreally force the fact"},"98":{"dur":2,"text":"that we must innovate\ndifferently-- very differently."},"101":{"dur":1,"text":"Is there something\nthat you've heard,"},"103":{"dur":1,"text":"some kind of idea\nthat has really"},"104":{"dur":2,"text":"gotten you excited today?"},"107":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, I think the\nrepurposing of drugs"},"108":{"dur":3,"text":"that we heard in the\nAccelerating Innovation panel"},"112":{"dur":3,"text":"from Daria Mochly-Rosen\nand from Dr. Garner,"},"115":{"dur":3,"text":"but also earlier in the day from\nDon Mabbott, the notion that we"},"119":{"dur":4,"text":"can repurpose existing drugs\nand do so efficaciously, faster,"},"124":{"dur":1,"text":"and they seem to be working."},"125":{"dur":4,"text":"So metformin, diabetes,\nhaving an improved outcome"},"130":{"dur":2,"text":"on cognitive\nfunctioning kids who've"},"132":{"dur":2,"text":"had brain tumors removed\nand other things like that"},"134":{"dur":2,"text":"are really exciting."},"137":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's on the drug side."},"138":{"dur":3,"text":"I think in terms of other topics\nthat I'm very, very excited"},"142":{"dur":4,"text":"about, it's just the notion\nthat come from my lab"},"147":{"dur":3,"text":"and from other labs that we can\ncapitalize on citizen science"},"151":{"dur":4,"text":"and patient driven data\nacquisition to accelerate"},"155":{"dur":3,"text":"the pace of big data generation\nthat enables us to more"},"158":{"dur":5,"text":"quickly validate our\nmethods, our models,"},"163":{"dur":2,"text":"and that can also,\nonce validated,"},"166":{"dur":5,"text":"be quickly transformed\ninto a clinical solution."},"171":{"dur":3,"text":"What I mean by that is you\nhave an app on your iPhone"},"174":{"dur":4,"text":"that measures something--\nfinger taps, for example--"},"179":{"dur":1,"text":"and that finger\ntapping turns out"},"181":{"dur":3,"text":"to be strongly linked to the\nseverity of a concussion."},"184":{"dur":2,"text":"Once we know that, we\ncan convert the app"},"187":{"dur":1,"text":"into a clinical\nuse tool that can"},"189":{"dur":3,"text":"be used on the soccer fields\nor on the football fields,"},"193":{"dur":1,"text":"so it's very exciting."},"194":{"dur":2,"text":"Your work focuses\nspecifically on autism."},"197":{"dur":1,"text":"Are there any\ninnovations that you're"},"199":{"dur":3,"text":"excited about in that field?"},"203":{"dur":2,"text":"Yes, many."},"205":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact, we're working\non many right now."},"207":{"dur":2,"text":"We've developed\nmachine learning models"},"210":{"dur":5,"text":"that we believe can identify\nsigns and symptoms of autism"},"215":{"dur":3,"text":"in minutes as\nopposed to hours that"},"218":{"dur":3,"text":"can be done from home\nusing home videos."},"222":{"dur":1,"text":"We've done that kind of work."},"224":{"dur":1,"text":"We've licensed some\nof that technology"},"225":{"dur":1,"text":"to a company called\nCognoa and they're"},"227":{"dur":3,"text":"taking it forward and trying to\nunderstand how to position it,"},"230":{"dur":2,"text":"so it fits very well with\nthis conference in the sense"},"232":{"dur":1,"text":"that it's an accelerated\ninnovation that"},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"has the potential to be a\nhandheld digital solution"},"237":{"dur":2,"text":"for families who\nface risks of autism"},"240":{"dur":1,"text":"or other developmental delays."},"241":{"dur":3,"text":"That's really for\nscreening and for bridging"},"245":{"dur":2,"text":"the gap between families and\nclinicians who can help them,"},"248":{"dur":1,"text":"giving them knowledge,\nand knowledge"},"249":{"dur":1,"text":"is power and all of that."},"251":{"dur":1,"text":"But then once they\nknow, once they"},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"have that definitive\ndiagnosis, there's"},"255":{"dur":2,"text":"another need there that\nneeds to be addressed,"},"257":{"dur":2,"text":"which is access to\ntherapeutic programs,"},"260":{"dur":6,"text":"and so we've begun to work on\nthe Google Glass technologies."},"266":{"dur":3,"text":"We've developed face\ntracking systems"},"269":{"dur":4,"text":"that we've harnessed to\ndo emotional detection"},"273":{"dur":3,"text":"of the person with whom\nthe wearer is interacting,"},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's very, very\nefficacious so far."},"279":{"dur":1,"text":"We believe it could\nbe a natural way"},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"to provide continuous\ntherapeutic intervention"},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"for kids who lack the\nability to detect emotions"},"285":{"dur":4,"text":"in faces on a continual basis,\nbut also in a natural setting."},"290":{"dur":1,"text":"That's really cutting edge."},"291":{"dur":0,"text":"I think so."},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"I hope so."},"294":{"dur":3,"text":"For this conference,\nif you had to guess,"},"298":{"dur":3,"text":"what would be the next big\nbreakthrough, or even category"},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"of breakthrough for pediatrics?"},"303":{"dur":2,"text":"What would it be?"},"306":{"dur":1,"text":"That's a great question."},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"I think there's many that are\nswarming around in my mind."},"310":{"dur":4,"text":"So let's take measuring\nglucose levels"},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"to keep your diabetes in check."},"317":{"dur":1,"text":"It's done now in\na very painful way"},"319":{"dur":1,"text":"but it's possible\nthat we could do it"},"320":{"dur":3,"text":"by combining a very simple\ndevice that a person could wear"},"324":{"dur":3,"text":"that interacts via Bluetooth\nwith a device like an iPhone"},"327":{"dur":5,"text":"or an iPad, and that will\nenable continuous measurements"},"333":{"dur":2,"text":"of glucose levels which\nwe can't do today."},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"It's done very sporadically."},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"This is actually happening\nhere at Stanford,"},"340":{"dur":3,"text":"not by me but by colleagues\nof mine working in pediatrics,"},"343":{"dur":3,"text":"trying to develop new ways that\npeople take home that provide"},"347":{"dur":1,"text":"continuous measurements\nof glucose levels"},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"that enable better\nmanagement of diabetes."},"351":{"dur":1,"text":"So I think that will be done."},"353":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that will happen."},"354":{"dur":5,"text":"I think the work that we've\ndone with at home screening,"},"360":{"dur":3,"text":"early detection of signs of\ndevelopmental delay and autism"},"363":{"dur":3,"text":"will be a realized\nmechanism that"},"366":{"dur":3,"text":"can streamline the\nprocess that exists today"},"370":{"dur":1,"text":"as a standard of\ncare and get families"},"371":{"dur":1,"text":"to the front of the line faster."},"373":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that will happen."},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"I think we'll have\nparents providing"},"376":{"dur":3,"text":"increasingly larger\namounts of data"},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"that not only are\nsurvey based data,"},"382":{"dur":4,"text":"but that are biological,\nso genetics information"},"387":{"dur":4,"text":"and microbiological information\nthat we can use to reciprocally"},"391":{"dur":3,"text":"illuminate what's happening\nwith a specific disease."},"395":{"dur":1,"text":"I think about autism, of course."},"396":{"dur":3,"text":"So there, we can try to\nidentify combined modalities."},"399":{"dur":2,"text":"There's genetic changes\nhere that correlate"},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"with microbiological\nchanges here"},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"that correspond to a\nseverity of phenotype,"},"405":{"dur":1,"text":"and therefore, we\nbecome predictive,"},"407":{"dur":1,"text":"and that prediction\nbecomes something"},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"we can turn into a\nclinical translation event"},"411":{"dur":1,"text":"very immediately."},"412":{"dur":0,"text":"That's really amazing."},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"I think you can just really\nfeel the innovation here."},"415":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you so much\nfor speaking with me."},"416":{"dur":1,"text":"Really appreciate it."},"417":{"dur":0,"text":"My pleasure."},"418":{"dur":1,"text":"Thanks, Dr. Wall."}}
