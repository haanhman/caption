things--"},"3689":{"dur":3,"text":"that that can be very\nhealing and very spiritual."},"3692":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think we tend to\ndenigrate recreational use."},"3695":{"dur":2,"text":"It's somehow lower."},"3697":{"dur":3,"text":"But I think that it's\npeople's attitudes."},"3701":{"dur":1,"text":"When you open up\nyour mind, and if you"},"3702":{"dur":2,"text":"say I only want a\ngood

set up,"},"3723":{"dur":3,"text":"people will be able to have a\ndeeper understanding of what"},"3727":{"dur":1,"text":"these drugs really do."},"3728":{"dur":2,"text":"And also, as the rules\nabout

we'll have a lot."},"3743":{"dur":2,"text":"But I do think that,\nculturally, we're"},"3745":{"dur":3,"text":"past the point where tragedies\nfrom the hedonistic use"},"3749":{"dur":1,"text":"will doom the medical use."},"3751":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think now, the data\nabout the medical use"},"3754":{"dur":4,"text":"is so compelling and the need\nis so great that, now, I'm"},"3758":{"dur":0,"text":"not worried about it."},"3759":{"dur":2,"text":"But I do think we need to\nredefine recreational use"},"3762":{"dur":2,"text":"and not just think\nof it as

Oh."},"3771":{"dur":2,"text":"AUDIENCE: Thanks so much for\ncoming and speaking to us."},"3773":{"dur":1,"text":"And I have a question\nin a similar vein,"},"3775":{"dur":2,"text":"where the data

out."},"3783":{"dur":3,"text":"But at some point, politically,\nsome aspiring politician"},"3787":{"dur":3,"text":"may think, oh, this is\nsomething that I can just"},"3790":{"dur":1,"text":"go after and say,\nhey, drugs are bad."},"3792":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is what's\ngoing to get me elected."},"3794":{"dur":2,"text":"So what do you really\nthink is that critical

no, MDMA,"},"3802":{"dur":1,"text":"LSD, psilocybin is terrible."},"3804":{"dur":2,"text":"And you guys should keep\nyour kids away from it."},"3806":{"dur":1,"text":"And you shouldn't be doing

less."},"3812":{"dur":2,"text":"I think the critical\nturning point"},"3814":{"dur":4,"text":"is going to be when FDA says yes\nto making these into medicines."},"3819":{"dur":1,"text":"And that'll be six years."},"3820":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think it's perilous,\nyou could say, between now"},"3822":{"dur":0,"text":"and then."},"3823":{"dur":2,"text":"Another turning point\nis going to be sooner."},"3825":{"dur":2,"text":"In this coming year, when\nwe negotiate with FDA"},"3828":{"dur":2,"text":"and the Heffter people\nnegotiate about psilocybin"},"3831":{"dur":2,"text":"and move to Phase\n3-- once they say,"},"3833":{"dur":3,"text":"yes, you can go to Phase 3,\nthat's a strong endorsement."},"3837":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, I think it will\nnot be possible to block"},"3839":{"dur":2,"text":"what we're doing, at least\nuntil it gets to the point"},"3842":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, the question is,\ndoes it become approved?"},"3845":{"dur":2,"text":"But I think this idea\nof politicians saying,"},"3848":{"dur":2,"text":"let's ramp up the\ndrug war-- that there"},"3850":{"dur":3,"text":"is rare bipartisan\nanything in Washington."},"3853":{"dur":4,"text":"But there is a fair amount\nof bipartisan recognition"},"3858":{"dur":4,"text":"that mass incarceration has\nbeen a disaster for America"},"3862":{"dur":3,"text":"and has been incredibly\nracist, incredibly destructive."},"3865":{"dur":3,"text":"And you know, the\nChinese say, crisis"},"3869":{"dur":1,"text":"is danger and opportunity."},"3870":{"dur":3,"text":"So right now, the fact\nthat heroin and phentynol"},"3874":{"dur":2,"text":"are now used by more\nand more white people"},"3876":{"dur":1,"text":"and there is more\nand more deaths"},"3877":{"dur":4,"text":"from opiate addiction, that is\nchanging people's attitudes."},"3881":{"dur":2,"text":"And now, there is a more\ncompassionate approach,"},"3884":{"dur":1,"text":"in a lot of places,\ntowards treatment"},"3886":{"dur":1,"text":"instead of incarceration."},"3888":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think those\nvoices that are saying,"},"3890":{"dur":3,"text":"ramp up the drug\nwar-- they don't"},"3894":{"dur":1,"text":"have as much power anymore."},"3895":{"dur":3,"text":"But I am sensitive to\nthe potential backlash."},"3899":{"dur":5,"text":"But I feel fairly hopeful that\nwe will be able to continue."},"3905":{"dur":3,"text":"But it is still risky."},"3908":{"dur":2,"text":"And the other part of\nit is the veterans."},"3911":{"dur":3,"text":"So when you talk about\nhealing people that"},"3915":{"dur":2,"text":"are held in high\nesteem by our culture--"},"3918":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm not trying to say I'm\npro-war and everything"},"3920":{"dur":1,"text":"the military does is great."},"3921":{"dur":2,"text":"But by healing\nveterans-- veterans"},"3924":{"dur":4,"text":"are a counter-force to\nthe police, to the DEA."},"3928":{"dur":4,"text":"And in fact, in our study, we've\nsaid, for political reasons,"},"3932":{"dur":2,"text":"we're going to change\nthe title of the

9\/11."},"3947":{"dur":3,"text":"And we had one police\nofficer volunteer."},"3951":{"dur":1,"text":"And so, when you think\nabout it, there's"},"3953":{"dur":3,"text":"very few jobs in America that\nare as traumatizing as being"},"3956":{"dur":1,"text":"a police officer."},"3958":{"dur":2,"text":"And because of\nthe drug war, I've"},"3961":{"dur":2,"text":"not had much compassion\nfor the police."},"3963":{"dur":3,"text":"I felt like, I'm the prey\nand they're the hunter."},"3967":{"dur":3,"text":"But to try to get out\nof that kind of mindset,"},"3970":{"dur":3,"text":"I think showing to the police\neven that MDMA therapy can"},"3974":{"dur":2,"text":"help them in their\nown-- there is just"},"3977":{"dur":4,"text":"a lot of terrible situations\nthat police have to see."},"3981":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're doing what\nwe can to cross"},"3983":{"dur":2,"text":"those divides and\nundercut arguments"},"3985":{"dur":3,"text":"that we need to protect the kids\nor we need to protect America"},"3988":{"dur":4,"text":"by ramping up the drug war."},"3993":{"dur":2,"text":"AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was\nwondering, how broad"},"3995":{"dur":1,"text":"is the term \"psychedelic\"?"},"3997":{"dur":3,"text":"In the sense of, what are\nsome of the differences"},"4000":{"dur":2,"text":"in the mechanisms and effects\nwhen you talk about LSD"},"4003":{"dur":2,"text":"or psilocybin or MDMA?"},"4005":{"dur":1,"text":"RICK DOBLIN: Yeah,\ngreat question."},"4007":{"dur":3,"text":"So I would say that\nthere is a group of drugs"},"4011":{"dur":1,"text":"that we call the\nclassic psychedelics."},"4012":{"dur":3,"text":"And those are like LSD,\nmescaline from peyote,"},"4016":{"dur":2,"text":"mushrooms, ayahuasca, ibogaine."},"4019":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's been\nincredible research"},"4022":{"dur":3,"text":"now with brain scans with\npeople under the influence"},"4025":{"dur":2,"text":"So we have not just\npsychedelic psychotherapy,"},"4027":{"dur":2,"text":"but psychedelic\nneuroscience is happening."},"4030":{"dur":1,"text":"And so there's two\ndifferent things"},"4032":{"dur":1,"text":"that happen with the\nclassic psychedelics"},"4034":{"dur":2,"text":"and then what's happened with\nMDMA and drugs like that."},"4036":{"dur":3,"text":"And the difference is that,\nwith the classic psychedelics,"},"4040":{"dur":3,"text":"there's a network in the\nbrain called the Default Mode"},"4043":{"dur":0,"text":"Network."},"4044":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's more\nor less identified"},"4046":{"dur":1,"text":"as the ego structures."},"4047":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's like, when you're not\ndoing anything in particular,"},"4050":{"dur":1,"text":"you're kind of scanning\nthe environment,"},"4051":{"dur":1,"text":"you're looking for\nwhat's important to you"},"4053":{"dur":2,"text":"for your different\nhierarchy of needs,"},"4055":{"dur":2,"text":"but you're kind of ego-focused,\ncentered in yourself."},"4058":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's actually\nso much information"},"4060":{"dur":1,"text":"that we're perceiving\nall the time,"},"4061":{"dur":1,"text":"but we don't pay\nattention to it all."},"4063":{"dur":1,"text":"It would be overwhelming."},"4064":{"dur":3,"text":"So the Default Mode Network\nfilters out everything"},"4067":{"dur":1,"text":"that you think is not important."},"4069":{"dur":2,"text":"Like there's noises of\nthe air conditioning."},"4072":{"dur":2,"text":"There's noises that we're not\nreally paying attention to."},"4074":{"dur":2,"text":"So what the classic\npsychedelics do"},"4076":{"dur":3,"text":"is they weaken the\nDefault Mode Network."},"4080":{"dur":4,"text":"And they permit a flood\nof perceptions to emerge."},"4084":{"dur":4,"text":"The woman, Amanda Fielding--\nshe heads the Beckley"},"4088":{"dur":0,"text":"Foundation in England."},"4089":{"dur":1,"text":"She funded this research."},"4091":{"dur":2,"text":"And what I'm so\nproud of her for is"},"4093":{"dur":3,"text":"that she thought, since the\n'60s, from her experiences"},"4097":{"dur":3,"text":"with LSD, that LSD must increase\nblood flow in the brain."},"4100":{"dur":2,"text":"It must increase your activity."},"4102":{"dur":1,"text":"But actually it doesn't."},"4103":{"dur":3,"text":"It decreases activity in\nthese Default Mode Networks."},"4107":{"dur":1,"text":"MDMA doesn't really do that."},"4109":{"dur":3,"text":"What MDMA does is\nit reduces activity"},"4112":{"dur":2,"text":"in the amygdala, which\nis the fear processing"},"4114":{"dur":0,"text":"part of the brain."},"4115":{"dur":3,"text":"And it enhances activity in\nthe frontal cortex, where"},"4119":{"dur":1,"text":"you put things in associations."},"4121":{"dur":2,"text":"So you have a reduced\nfear about trauma."},"4124":{"dur":3,"text":"And then, when you're\nable to recall the memory,"},"4127":{"dur":2,"text":"you can really set\nit in to the past"},"4130":{"dur":2,"text":"instead of constantly\nintruding on the present."},"4132":{"dur":3,"text":"And MDMA doesn't\ndissolve the ego the way"},"4136":{"dur":1,"text":"the classic psychedelics do."},"4137":{"dur":2,"text":"But it helps people feel\nso grounded and centered"},"4140":{"dur":3,"text":"in themself that, then, they\ncan see the wider world."},"4143":{"dur":4,"text":"Stan Groff has talked\nabout it as, you're"},"4148":{"dur":2,"text":"transparent to the transcendent."},"4150":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's more like MDMA."},"4152":{"dur":2,"text":"You become transparent\nto the transcendent."},"4154":{"dur":2,"text":"Whereas LSD sort of\ndissolves everything that"},"4157":{"dur":3,"text":"keeps you feeling
