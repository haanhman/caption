particular focus on its command and\ncontrol systems."},"129":{"dur":4,"text":"So, to talk about the 9th Brigade first."},"133":{"dur":3,"text":"They were formed in late 1915, early 1916"},"137":{"dur":4,"text":"and constituted the 33rd, 34th, 35th and 36th Battalions."},"141":{"dur":6,"text":"And the brigade had a very distinct regional identity."},"147":{"dur":5,"text":"In a way it's quite similar to our own 'Pals'\nbattalions in the UK."},"152":{"dur":3,"text":"The 33rd Battalion was drawn from the New\nEngland district,"},"156":{"dur":5,"text":"largely from Armidale, and they were known\nas 'New England's Own'."},"161":{"dur":3,"text":"So you are kind of getting the resonance here\nwith our 'Pals' battalions."},"164":{"dur":4,"text":"The 34th Battalion were largely drawn from\nMaitland, just here,"},"169":{"dur":3,"text":"and there were known as 'Maitland's Own'."},"172":{"dur":6,"text":"The 35th Battalion were drawn from Newcastle,\nbut also from the wider Hunter region,"},"178":{"dur":1,"text":"and they were known as 'Newcastle's Own'."},"180":{"dur":3,"text":"And what was important, I suppose, with the\n35th Battalion"},"183":{"dur":4,"text":"is that there was a high proportion of miners\nwithin that battalion as well,"},"187":{"dur":4,"text":"so it lent a social dimension alongside its\nregional affinity."},"192":{"dur":5,"text":"The 36th Battalion, however, were recruited\nsomewhat differently."},"197":{"dur":2,"text":"They were known as 'Carmichael's Thousand'."},"200":{"dur":4,"text":"The battalion was recruited from local

year when\nit attacked on 12 October 1917."},"317":{"dur":7,"text":"It had undertaken a large raid near Houplines,\nnear Armenti\u00e8res, in early 1917."},"324":{"dur":6,"text":"However, its real baptism of fire didn't come\nuntil the Battle of Messines in June 1917."},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think it is important to point out at\nthis point"},"333":{"dur":3,"text":"that it performed well in both of these operations."},"336":{"dur":7,"text":"So, where does First Passchendaele fit within\nthe wider Third Ypres campaign?"},"344":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, it feels a bit like teaching

Third Ypres campaign began on 31 July\n1917 with clear strategic goals."},"358":{"dur":5,"text":"Its aim was to drive the German Army off the\nridges east of Ypres,"},"364":{"dur":4,"text":"before

it would also create a strategic pincer\nmovement forming a flank"},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"around which the Allies could attack the Germans\nin the rear."},"396":{"dur":5,"text":"So this seems like eminently sensible clear\nstrategic goals."},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"Responsibility for the campaign was initially\ngranted to"},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"General Sir Hubert Gough, commander of the\nFifth Army."},"408":{"dur":4,"text":"The attacks of August 1917 had \nover-ambitious objectives"},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"and they were extremely costly."},"415":{"dur":3,"text":"Not only were the operations

formations to leapfrog one another"},"447":{"dur":5,"text":"and they benefit from very heavy creeping\nand standing barrages."},"452":{"dur":3,"text":"Between late September and early October 1917,"},"456":{"dur":6,"text":"the Battles of Menin Road, Polygon Wood, and\nBroodseinde were fought to great effect"},"463":{"dur":3,"text":"and they appeared to vindicate bite-and-hold

October"},"478":{"dur":4,"text":"and there followed the heaviest rainfall in\nthe region in 75 years."},"483":{"dur":4,"text":"And the thing with this dry weather, prior\nto the downfall,"},"487":{"dur":4,"text":"is that it actually masked the reality of\na forward communications system"},"491":{"dur":4,"text":"that was completely inadequate and close to collapse."},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"But in spite of this inadequacy \nand the torrential rain,"},"500":{"dur":5,"text":"two further assaults were agreed forming the\nthird phase of this

in Second Anzac [Corps], the 49th\nand the 66th."},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"The result was a costly failure."},"520":{"dur":5,"text":"Poor preparation, poor communications and\nweak artillery support"},"525":{"dur":4,"text":"contributed significantly to this operation's failure."},"529":{"dur":4,"text":"The decision to attack again three days later\non 12 October"},"533":{"dur":4,"text":"was to gain the last section of high ground\nbefore the winter set in."},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"Preparation time was seriously reduced"},"541":{"dur":4,"text":"to the detriment of both logistic \nand artillery support."},"545":{"dur":5,"text":"In my very humble opinion First Passchendaele\nwas simply an operational step too far."},"551":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, what I want to do for this next section\nis again talk you through the battle"},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"and pull out some of these key personalities\nand actions."},"560":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I hope you can see some of the maps."},"564":{"dur":3,"text":"I will use the laser if not."},"568":{"dur":3,"text":"The First Battle of Passchendaele was very\nmuch a Second Anzac operation."},"571":{"dur":5,"text":"It operates with the New Zealand Division\nand the 3rd Australian Division in the front."},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"It does have support from First Anzac Corps"},"580":{"dur":4,"text":"in the form of the 12th Brigade that are drawn\nfrom the 4th Division."},"584":{"dur":3,"text":"The tasks for the divisions on the day:"},"588":{"dur":7,"text":"New Zealand Division were to take the Bellevue\nSpur on the left here;"},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"the 3rd Division were to take the main Passchendaele\nRidge here;"},"598":{"dur":5,"text":"and the 12th Brigade were to provide a flank\nguard for the 3rd Division."},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, I think if any of you have been across\nthis ground"},"607":{"dur":7,"text":"you will know that this area is dominated\nby three spurs that sit in an E shape here."},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"And basically what this means is that defenders\non each spur"},"620":{"dur":3,"text":"can support each other with flanking fire."},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"And 9th Brigade itself is subject to both\nreverse fire"},"627":{"dur":5,"text":"and enfilade fire throughout \nthe operation itself."},"632":{"dur":3,"text":"The objectives for 3rd Division's attack:"},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"the first objective - the red line -"},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"that's an initial advance of 1,200 yards [1,100m];"},"640":{"dur":1,"text":"the blue line - second objective -"},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"a further 500 yards [460m];"},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"and the green line - just beyond \nPasschendaele village -"},"647":{"dur":4,"text":"is a final 765 yards [700m]."},"652":{"dur":5,"text":"The total depth of attack on 12 October is\napproximately 2,500 yards [2,300m]."},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"These objectives were almost double those set"},"660":{"dur":6,"text":"to the 49th and 66th Divisions on 9 October,\nthree days earlier."},"667":{"dur":3,"text":"To focus down on a bit of the nitty-gritty here."},"670":{"dur":6,"text":"The axis of 9th Brigade's assault actually\nruns diagonal to the axis of the ridgeline."},"676":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, if anyone's tried to negotiate this,"},"680":{"dur":3,"text":"it generally goes against the tendency to\nfollow the contour line."},"684":{"dur":3,"text":"So, basically what you get here is a kind\nof a wedge developing,"},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"where battalions start following the ridgeline,"},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"which causes all kinds of contact problems\nwith this formation here."},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"So, 9th Brigade start going up here."},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"And, as we'll see later, those contact problems and"},"699":{"dur":3,"text":"communication problems are incredibly important."},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"The taking of objectives."},"706":{"dur":5,"text":"This is the typical Second Army way of doing\nthings in operations -"},"711":{"dur":1,"text":"they leapfrog battalions."},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"So, the 34th Battalion is to take the red line,"},"716":{"dur":3,"text":"35th Battalion to pass through them to take\nthe blue line,"},"720":{"dur":4,"text":"and 36th Battalion to pass through both of\nthem to take the green line."},"724":{"dur":5,"text":"33rd Battalion down here are held in \ndivisional reserve,"},"730":{"dur":4,"text":"before being passed to command of brigade\nat midday."},"734":{"dur":6,"text":"But they were only to be used if the 10th\nBrigade, operating in this sector, gets held up."},"741":{"dur":5,"text":"This is an incredibly contentious issue between\nRosenthal and Monash."},"746":{"dur":3,"text":"It highlights a number of command \nand exploitation problems,"},"750":{"dur":4,"text":"which I will discuss later on in the talk."},"754":{"dur":1,"text":"The battle itself."},"756":{"dur":4,"text":"It commences at 5:25 in the morning \non 12 October."},"761":{"dur":3,"text":"The approach march and the initial stages\nare incredibly difficult."},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"Not only does it take approximately four hours"},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"to traverse the one mile [1.6km] between Zonnebeke\nand Tyne Cot,"},"771":{"dur":5,"text":"the approach is hampered by enemy shelling\nand heavy machine-gun fire."},"777":{"dur":5,"text":"In fact, intelligence reports from Second\nAnzac suggests that the 6th and 8th J\u00e4ger Regiments,"},"782":{"dur":4,"text":"part of the 195th Division that are facing\nSecond Anzac,"},"787":{"dur":3,"text":"actually have double allowances of light and\nheavy machine guns,"},"791":{"dur":2,"text":"and these are all employed in depth."},"793":{"dur":4,"text":"This attack is not a surprise to \nthe Germans opposite."},"798":{"dur":4,"text":"But, in spite of that, the 34th Battalion\ndo manage"},"803":{"dur":3,"text":"to take their objective at 7:00 in the morning,"},"806":{"dur":6,"text":"which - an hour and thirty-five minutes after\nthe start of the attack - is pretty good going."},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"This picture - again it feels a bit strange\nshowing this picture"},"815":{"dur":5,"text":"because it's a beautiful sunny day in Belgium,\nand obviously it wasn't on 12 October 1917"},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"but this is to provide a bit of context."},"823":{"dur":3,"text":"So you've got Passchendaele church in the\nbackground there."},"827":{"dur":3,"text":"This line really is about where the red line was."},"830":{"dur":3,"text":"And this picture is taken on the 9th and 12th\nBrigade boundary,"},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"so we're looking north up the battlefield."},"837":{"dur":3,"text":"And this position here is just in front of\nthe blue line,"},"841":{"dur":5,"text":"so you get a bit of a sense of the kind of\ndistances they're traversing."},"846":{"dur":3,"text":"We have the 34th Battalion on the red line,"},"849":{"dur":5,"text":"so at this point it is the 35th Battalion's\nturn to move through them to take the blue line."},"855":{"dur":3,"text":"But unfortunately the 35th Battalion are unable\nto do this."},"858":{"dur":2,"text":"They can't take the blue line without assistance."},"861":{"dur":2,"text":"They've suffered a number of heavy casualties"},"863":{"dur":3,"text":"owing to this heavy enemy shelling \nand machine-gun fire."},"866":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's around about this point in the battle"},"869":{"dur":3,"text":"that Clarence Jeffries wins his Victoria Cross."},"872":{"dur":6,"text":"Now, I want to dial back a bit here in that\nJeffries is an officer in the 34th Battalion."},"879":{"dur":3,"text":"The 34th Battalion were on their approach\nto the red line."},"882":{"dur":3,"text":"They get held up by a German pillbox on the\nPasschendaele Ridge,"},"885":{"dur":2,"text":"and it begins to hold up the advance."},"888":{"dur":4,"text":"So Jeffries, using his initiative, organises\na group of his men."},"893":{"dur":6,"text":"He attacks and captures the position and takes\nfour guns and 35 prisoners,"},"899":{"dur":4,"text":"which is fantastic, which means that 35th\nBattalion can now pass through"},"903":{"dur":1,"text":"and take the blue line."},"904":{"dur":2,"text":"But unfortunately their advance is held up."},"907":{"dur":5,"text":"There is a machine-gun position at Tiber,\nthe position that I highlighted earlier,"},"913":{"dur":1,"text":"and it holds up their advance."},"914":{"dur":4,"text":"Jeffries, again realising that it is important\nfor him to use his initiative,"},"919":{"dur":3,"text":"again mobilises a group of men."},"922":{"dur":3,"text":"He comes up from the red line, makes for this\ngun position,"},"926":{"dur":5,"text":"deploys his men, rushes the emplacement and\nis killed in doing so."},"931":{"dur":3,"text":"His men manage to work around the position\nand take the prisoners,"},"935":{"dur":2,"text":"and they take the pillbox."},"938":{"dur":2,"text":"But unfortunately he is killed in doing so."},"941":{"dur":4,"text":"And Jeffries is buried in Tyne Cot cemetery\nand some of you may have visited his grave."},"945":{"dur":1,"text":"And, as you can see from the picture,"},"947":{"dur":6,"text":"it is one of the most visited graves probably\nin that cemetery."},"953":{"dur":5,"text":"Following Jeffries's action, the 34th Battalion\nactually move up"},"958":{"dur":3,"text":"to help the 35th, reinforcing on the right."},"962":{"dur":4,"text":"And the 36th Battalion, rather than pushing\non to the green line,"},"966":{"dur":1,"text":"decide to reinforce on the left."},"968":{"dur":2,"text":"This happens at around about 10:00 \nin the morning."},"971":{"dur":3,"text":"So by 10:00 in the morning the left-hand side\nof the blue line"},"974":{"dur":2,"text":"is in a fairly well-consolidated position."},"977":{"dur":3,"text":"But the problem is it involves \nall three assaulting battalions,"},"980":{"dur":2,"text":"which means that it is going to be \nvery difficult for them"},"983":{"dur":3,"text":"to push on and take the final objective."},"986":{"dur":3,"text":"And you will also see that there's a large\nswath of the blue line here"},"990":{"dur":7,"text":"that remains uncaptured and will remain uncaptured\nfor the rest of the day."},"998":{"dur":1,"text":"Throughout this battle, as I alluded to earlier,"},"999":{"dur":5,"text":"the 9th Brigade are subject to heavy enfilade\nfire, particularly on its left flank,"},"1005":{"dur":3,"text":"and this comes from positions such as Crest Farm,"},"1008":{"dur":2,"text":"but also from Passchendaele village itself."},"1011":{"dur":3,"text":"And the problem with the left flank is really\nbecause the New Zealand Division,"},"1015":{"dur":5,"text":"who are operating here, are unable to capture\nthe Bellevue Spur."},"1020":{"dur":3,"text":"They actually get stopped in front of Bellevue Farm,"},"1023":{"dur":6,"text":"which is really just before all the red barbed wire."},"1029":{"dur":4,"text":"This account on screen is taken from the 40th\nBattalion's regimental history -"},"1034":{"dur":3,"text":"40th Battalion were in the 10th Brigade serving\nnext to the New Zealanders -"},"1038":{"dur":6,"text":"and I think you'll agree that it makes for\nvery harrowing reading."},"1045":{"dur":7,"text":"And not only was enfilade fire received from\nthe left flank,"},"1055":{"dur":5,"text":"but it was also received on the right, again\nfrom this position Tiber, Assyria"},"1061":{"dur":4,"text":"and also a position that's just off the screen\ndown here called the Keiburg."},"1066":{"dur":4,"text":"And the Keiburg is really a small ridgeline\nthat runs off the main Passchendaele Ridge"},"1070":{"dur":7,"text":"and causes all sorts of issues with 9th Brigade\nand their advance."},"1079":{"dur":5,"text":"The 9th Brigade, unsurprisingly perhaps, are\nunable to hold onto the blue line"},"1084":{"dur":5,"text":"owing to heavy fire and a loss of support\non both flanks."},"1089":{"dur":2,"text":"The blue line is on a forward slope,"},"1092":{"dur":4,"text":"which means that it's under direct observation\nfrom the east,"},"1096":{"dur":4,"text":"but also from the south positions here."},"1101":{"dur":3,"text":"Divisional orders are for the blue line to\nbe held at all costs,"},"1104":{"dur":4,"text":"but this was simply impossible due to fire\nand heavy casualties."},"1109":{"dur":4,"text":"So the 9th Brigade decide to withdraw from\nthe blue line"},"1113":{"dur":3,"text":"between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon."},"1117":{"dur":5,"text":"They had been in this position for six hours\nsustaining incredibly heavy casualties."},"1122":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, unfortunately, there was no chance to\nreconnoitre the positions behind them"},"1128":{"dur":3,"text":"and they ended up withdrawing beyond the red line"},"1131":{"dur":5,"text":"and actually dug in just in advance of their\njump off point."},"1136":{"dur":4,"text":"The order to withdraw was given by Major Henry Carr,"},"1141":{"dur":3,"text":"an officer in the 35th Battalion"},"1144":{"dur":2,"text":"and the senior officer on the blue line \nat that time -"},"1147":{"dur":3,"text":"so it was his judgement call to make."},"1150":{"dur":2,"text":"And his actions resulted in a Court of Enquiry"},"1153":{"dur":6,"text":"to ascertain why the 9th Brigade decided to\nwithdraw from this position."},"1159":{"dur":2,"text":"Prior to the withdrawal, \nas you can see from the map,"},"1161":{"dur":4,"text":"they made a fairly substantial advance of\nabout 1,700 yards [1,500m] -"},"1166":{"dur":5,"text":"the furthest advance on 12 October - but this\ncame at a heavy cost."},"1172":{"dur":3,"text":"They were suffering about \n70 per cent officer casualties"},"1175":{"dur":3,"text":"and about 67 per cent casualties \nfor other ranks,"},"1179":{"dur":4,"text":"so this was not a cheap operation."},"1183":{"dur":3,"text":"And this picture on the screen is the Defy Crossing"},"1187":{"dur":4,"text":"and this marks the limit of the Australians'\nadvance on 12 October."},"1191":{"dur":4,"text":"And the reason I put that up is to show you\nthe type of churned-up terrain"},"1195":{"dur":4,"text":"that these troops are having to attack across\non 12 October."},"1200":{"dur":2,"text":"So that was the battle."},"1202":{"dur":5,"text":"What can we deduce then about 9th Brigade's\nperformance in this operation?"},"1208":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, in my view, past performance, \nparticularly at Messines,"},"1213":{"dur":3,"text":"suggests that the 9th Brigade was a good,\nsteady formation."},"1216":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think this is really evidenced \nby the six hours"},"1219":{"dur":2,"text":"it spent on the blue line \nunder very heavy fire."},"1222":{"dur":4,"text":"But I do think its performance was subject\nto factors,"},"1226":{"dur":2,"text":"some of which were outside of its control."},"1229":{"dur":3,"text":"First, I would say, is the lack of preparation time."},"1233":{"dur":3,"text":"The brigade had at best three days to prepare\nfor this attack"},"1236":{"dur":5,"text":"and this detrimentally affected their artillery\nand logistic support."},"1241":{"dur":2,"text":"Second point: inclement weather."},"1244":{"dur":2,"text":"The rain was unseasonably heavy for the time of year."},"1247":{"dur":4,"text":"In fact, it was twice the average rainfall\nfor October and November."},"1251":{"dur":2,"text":"This affected the state of the ground,"},"1253":{"dur":4,"text":"it slowed the infantry and their ability to\nkeep up with the artillery barrage."},"1258":{"dur":3,"text":"And, of course, because of the state of the ground,"},"1261":{"dur":3,"text":"it meant that the graze fuse on the shells\ndidn't have enough resistance to
