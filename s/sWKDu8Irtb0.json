funny, I started writing\nmy first book many years ago."},"72":{"dur":2,"text":"My first two books were actually\non the chemistry of cooking."},"75":{"dur":2,"text":"I realized what was\nhappening in my lab."},"77":{"dur":2,"text":"I knew that in great depth,\nbut not in my kitchen."},"79":{"dur":1,"text":"And I made a list of\nall the questions I had,"},"81":{"dur":1,"text":"and I couldn't find the answers."},"83":{"dur":3,"text":"It was way back in 1991\nwhen that book came out."},"86":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I figured I better write\na book to find the answers."},"89":{"dur":2,"text":"So I am very curious."},"92":{"dur":3,"text":"And I, in teaching classes\non creativity and innovation"},"95":{"dur":4,"text":"for the last 15 years,\nrealized there was a big hole."},"99":{"dur":1,"text":"There was a big missing piece."},"101":{"dur":2,"text":"And I know you teach\na very similar class,"},"103":{"dur":1,"text":"so I'm hoping that\nmy contributions also"},"105":{"dur":1,"text":"help you as well."},"107":{"dur":4,"text":"I realize that we use the terms\nimagination and

lot of people use\nthe terms innovation"},"118":{"dur":1,"text":"and entrepreneurship\ninterchangeably."},"120":{"dur":3,"text":"And what happens is\nthis sloppiness results"},"123":{"dur":0,"text":"in a lot of problems."},"124":{"dur":1,"text":"One of the biggest\nproblems is that people"},"126":{"dur":1,"text":"think you can't teach this."},"127":{"dur":2,"text":"They don't know\nwhat it exactly is."},"129":{"dur":1,"text":"And they assume\nit's just innate."},"131":{"dur":2,"text":"And therefore, they\ndon't put any effort"},"133":{"dur":2,"text":"into thinking that they\ncould actually get better."},"135":{"dur":1,"text":"And so I realized\nI really wanted"},"137":{"dur":3,"text":"to put a stake in the ground in\nterms of what these things are"},"140":{"dur":3,"text":"and actually how one could\nmove through the process"},"144":{"dur":2,"text":"of generating the idea and\nthen bringing it to life."},"146":{"dur":2,"text":"FREDERICK: And as you mentioned,\nwe teach both a course"},"149":{"dur":1,"text":"on innovation and creativity."},"151":{"dur":1,"text":"So I think we share the\nbelief that everybody"},"153":{"dur":3,"text":"is a creative person and\na creative individual."},"156":{"dur":2,"text":"And you help really\nexplore people,"},"158":{"dur":3,"text":"their identity as an\ninnovator and find confidence"},"162":{"dur":1,"text":"and creativity as well."},"163":{"dur":3,"text":"So what are some practical tips\nyou can give us to really bring"},"167":{"dur":1,"text":"the best out of ourselves?"},"168":{"dur":0,"text":"TINA SEELIG: Great."},"169":{"dur":2,"text":"So there are so many\nthings that you can"},"171":{"dur":2,"text":"do to increase your creativity."},"173":{"dur":1,"text":"And I do agree."},"174":{"dur":1,"text":"I think we're all creative."},"176":{"dur":1,"text":"But in the same\nway that we all can"},"178":{"dur":3,"text":"learn about math or\nhistory or music or sports."},"181":{"dur":1,"text":"We have very different\nstarting points."},"183":{"dur":2,"text":"There's some people who are\nnaturally very creative."},"185":{"dur":2,"text":"Others really need\nmuch more coaching."},"188":{"dur":1,"text":"But there are definitely tools."},"189":{"dur":4,"text":"There's a combination of\nknowledge, skills, and mindset."},"193":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is very important."},"195":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not just what\nyou do, it's also"},"197":{"dur":1,"text":"the way you approach problems."},"199":{"dur":3,"text":"So what I do in my class,\nand I know you do as well,"},"202":{"dur":2,"text":"is focus a lot on\nhelping students"},"204":{"dur":2,"text":"push through the first\nwave of solutions"},"207":{"dur":1,"text":"to come up with\nreal innovations."},"209":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is one of the\nkey goals is teaching them"},"212":{"dur":3,"text":"how to look at the problems\nthey ask in the first place."},"215":{"dur":2,"text":"Sort of reframing the problem."},"217":{"dur":3,"text":"We so often go with\nthe first framing"},"221":{"dur":1,"text":"of a problem we come up with."},"223":{"dur":2,"text":"And that often might\nnot be the best way"},"225":{"dur":1,"text":"to think of the solutions."},"226":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll give you just\na simple example."},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"Does anyone in this\nroom have a birthday"},"231":{"dur":1,"text":"this week, or coming up?"},"232":{"dur":1,"text":"Actually, today's my\nfather's birthday,"},"233":{"dur":1,"text":"so we'll do it\nwith my father, OK?"},"235":{"dur":1,"text":"He's 89 today."},"237":{"dur":3,"text":"We could go out of our way\nto brainstorm about the best"},"240":{"dur":2,"text":"birthday party for my dad."},"242":{"dur":1,"text":"And that might be a great idea."},"244":{"dur":2,"text":"But if we change one word\nin that prompt to let's"},"247":{"dur":3,"text":"plan the best birthday\ncelebration-- what happened"},"250":{"dur":2,"text":"to the set of solutions?"},"253":{"dur":1,"text":"It expanded dramatically."},"255":{"dur":2,"text":"OK, what if we said we wanted\nto come up with the best way"},"257":{"dur":1,"text":"to mark my father's birthday?"},"259":{"dur":2,"text":"That would expand even larger."},"261":{"dur":2,"text":"And the profound piece\nof this-- and I really"},"264":{"dur":3,"text":"think it's quite profound--\nIs it the answer was actually"},"267":{"dur":1,"text":"baked into the question."},"269":{"dur":2,"text":"If you said let's\nplan a birthday party,"},"271":{"dur":2,"text":"the assumption was\nthat it was a party."},"274":{"dur":1,"text":"If you said let's\nplan a celebration,"},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"the assumption is that\nit's a celebration."},"278":{"dur":2,"text":"And so if you don't question\nthe questions you ask,"},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"you really are missing\na huge opportunity."},"282":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's one way that\nyou help people unpack"},"286":{"dur":1,"text":"their own creativity\nis just even thinking"},"288":{"dur":1,"text":"about the questions\nthey're asking."},"289":{"dur":2,"text":"FREDERICK: I think you quote\nat some stage Larry Page"},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"about moonshots and\nsetting ambitious goals."},"294":{"dur":2,"text":"So tell us a little bit\nmore about this concept"},"296":{"dur":2,"text":"and what inspires\nyou around that?"},"298":{"dur":1,"text":"TINA SEELIG: Yeah,\nyou know, it's"},"300":{"dur":4,"text":"fascinating because\neverybody figures out"},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"what stage they want\nto play out their life."},"306":{"dur":3,"text":"They figure out the\nimpact they want to have."},"309":{"dur":1,"text":"An example, a simple\nexample would be you"},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"could design a brand new\ncookie in your kitchen."},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"You can add some\ninteresting ingredients"},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"and come up with something\nthat no one has done before."},"317":{"dur":2,"text":"And you could just share it with\nyour friends and your family."},"320":{"dur":4,"text":"Or you could say, hey, I'm going\nto sell it at the local farmers"},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"Or I'm going to open\nup a cookie store."},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"Or I'm going to start a\nnational cookie chain."},"329":{"dur":3,"text":"Or I'm going to open up an\nentire global baking business."},"333":{"dur":1,"text":"That all starts with one cookie."},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"And so if you have\nthe idea that you"},"337":{"dur":1,"text":"want to do something\nbig and bold,"},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"you're going to give yourself\npermission to come up"},"340":{"dur":1,"text":"with these big, bold ideas."},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, it takes-- we all\nhave the same 24 hours in a day,"},"344":{"dur":1,"text":"And so it takes\njust as much time"},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"to do something big and bold as\nit does to do something small."},"349":{"dur":3,"text":"So giving yourself permission\nto think in really big,"},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"broad, bold strokes\nis really powerful."},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"And of course Google is such\nan amazing example of that."},"358":{"dur":3,"text":"I use lots of examples\nfrom Google all the time,"},"361":{"dur":3,"text":"and I think we should all look\nto Google as an inspiration"},"365":{"dur":3,"text":"because not only the\nimpact the company's had"},"368":{"dur":3,"text":"on our everyday lives, but\nthe culture of experimentation"},"372":{"dur":3,"text":"and really taking on\nvery big challenges."},"376":{"dur":4,"text":"FREDERICK: So I think setting\nyourselves ambitious goals is"},"380":{"dur":1,"text":"one thing, or having ideas."},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"But how can we actually get\nthose ideas out of our head"},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"and into the real world?"},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"Because I think that's\nalso your tagline here."},"388":{"dur":2,"text":"So can you give us a\nrecipe how we can actually"},"390":{"dur":0,"text":"make those ideas a reality."},"391":{"dur":1,"text":"TINA SEELIG: Yeah,\nit's interesting,"},"392":{"dur":1,"text":"I was mentioning\nbefore we started"},"394":{"dur":2,"text":"that I did a Reddit\nAMA last week, which"},"396":{"dur":1,"text":"was totally amazing."},"398":{"dur":3,"text":"And the thing that came up\nafter the thousands of people"},"401":{"dur":3,"text":"who signed into the conversation\nwas their frustration"},"405":{"dur":1,"text":"with the same problem."},"406":{"dur":1,"text":"They said I have all\nthese great ideas,"},"408":{"dur":1,"text":"but I don't know\nwhat to do next."},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm afraid that someone\nis going to steal my idea."},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"Or I'm afraid that if I\ndo it, it's going to fail."},"414":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's such an\ninteresting thing"},"416":{"dur":1,"text":"to see that people\nactually haven't"},"418":{"dur":1,"text":"been taught that process."},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"So here's the model that I've\npresented in the book, which"},"422":{"dur":1,"text":"I call the invention cycle."},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"And the idea-- you'll see\nat theend why it's a cycle--"},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"the idea is that you\nstart with imagination."},"429":{"dur":3,"text":"Imagination takes two things."},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"It requires one\nmindset, and one action."},"435":{"dur":1,"text":"The mindset is engaging."},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"Engaging with the\nworld, and then"},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"actively envisioning\nwhat could be different."},"442":{"dur":1,"text":"This is something a\nlot of people don't do,"},"444":{"dur":1,"text":"but the idea is that\nevery single day,"},"446":{"dur":1,"text":"you're going down the street."},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"You're going to see\nopportunities of problems that"},"449":{"dur":1,"text":"need to get solved, and\nthen you can envision"},"451":{"dur":1,"text":"what you'd do differently."},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact, before something is\nyour passion and something"},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"that you dive into,\nit's likely something"},"459":{"dur":1,"text":"that you know nothing about."},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's so many\nexamples of that."},"462":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm sure that all\nthe people who are"},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"in this room or the\npeople who are watching"},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"are doing things in their\nlives that at some point,"},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"they didn't know anything about."},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"But once they got\nengaged with it,"},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"the opportunities start\nopening up for them."},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's the imagination stage."},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"But now that you've envisioned\nwhat might be different,"},"477":{"dur":1,"text":"you move on to the\ncreativity stage."},"479":{"dur":3,"text":"And that requires motivation\nand experimentation."},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"Now the wonderful\nthing is, you can"},"484":{"dur":1,"text":"start with a little\nbit of motivation."},"485":{"dur":1,"text":"You don't need a lot."},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"A little bit of motivation\nleads to small experiments."},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"I know you spend a lot\nof time teaching people"},"491":{"dur":1,"text":"how to prototype."},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"And that is such an\nincredible skill, to say,"},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't have to do everything."},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, I can just with\na little bit of curiosity"},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"and motivation, do\nsome quick prototypes"},"502":{"dur":1,"text":"to see what might happen."},"504":{"dur":1,"text":"And of course, the\nresults of that--"},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"whether they work or they\ndon't-- will then fuel"},"508":{"dur":0,"text":"your motivation."},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"And so you end up getting this\nwonderful cycle of motivation"},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"and experimentation\nthat leads you"},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"ultimately to the next\nstep, which is innovation."},"516":{"dur":4,"text":"So creative ideas are new to\nyou, but not new to the world."},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"But when you then get\nto the innovation stage,"},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"that's when you push through."},"524":{"dur":4,"text":"That's with great focus, so\nthe mental state of focusing,"},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"leads to then reframing."},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"And we talked about\nthat a minute ago,"},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"the sort of the birthday party,\nthe birthday celebration."},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"By reframing, that's\nwhen you come up"},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"with real innovations that\nare not just new to you."},"539":{"dur":1,"text":"They're also new to the world."},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"And once you've mastered that--\nand each one of these steps"},"544":{"dur":1,"text":"gets harder than\nthe one before--"},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"but once you've\nmastered that, you then"},"547":{"dur":1,"text":"go to the\nentrepreneurship stage,"},"549":{"dur":3,"text":"which requires great persistence\nand inspiring others."},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"You can not do\nthese things alone."},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, look at\nthis amazing company"},"556":{"dur":1,"text":"with all of these people."},"558":{"dur":1,"text":"The things that\nare happening here"},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"would only happen\nbecause other people have"},"562":{"dur":1,"text":"been inspired to join the team."},"563":{"dur":4,"text":"And that is the cycle aspect, is\nyou get to the entrepreneurship"},"567":{"dur":4,"text":"stage, where you inspire others\nimagination, which then started"},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"their cycle all over again."},"574":{"dur":0,"text":"FREDERICK: Great."},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"Let me come back to the\nentrepreneurship in a second."},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"I want to stay a little bit\nlonger on the experimentation"},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"and prototyping."},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"Again, I find it\ntruly inspiring how"},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"you talk about this as well."},"587":{"dur":1,"text":"And you mention in\nyour book something"},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"where we can learn a lot\nfrom children actually"},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"and how they experiment\nand try out new things."},"593":{"dur":1,"text":"Can you talk a little\nbit more about that?"},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"TINA SEELIG: Yeah.\nisn't it true?"},"596":{"dur":3,"text":"I often ask people in\naudiences were you creative"},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"when you were a kid and ask, do\nyou have kids who are creative?"},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"You've got kids,\nare they creative?"},"604":{"dur":1,"text":"FREDERICK: Absolutely,\nI think so."},"606":{"dur":0,"text":"Like every other kid."},"607":{"dur":1,"text":"TINA SEELIG: Like every\nother kid, exactly."},"608":{"dur":1,"text":"And then what happens?"},"609":{"dur":1,"text":"And you'd ask adults\nare you creative?"},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"And a huge number say no."},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"And we say what happened?"},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"There are very\nfew other things I"},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"can think of besides learning\nnew languages that we"},"619":{"dur":1,"text":"get worse as we get older."},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, isn't that\ntotally crazy that people"},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"get worse at being\ncreative as they get older."},"625":{"dur":3,"text":"And it certainly comes down\nto our school systems--"},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"people are very\nresponsive to the rules,"},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"the rewards, the incentives\nthat are put in place."},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"And our schools are set\nup in so many places--"},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean not everywhere,\nbut in so many"},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"places-- where there's\none right answer,"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"and you are not encouraged\nto come up with really"},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"creative solutions to problems."},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"So the thing that\nwe have to do is"},"645":{"dur":5,"text":"sort of unlearn that and to\ngive people the permission"},"650":{"dur":4,"text":"to think the same way that\nthey did when they were kids."},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"FREDERICK: So we\nboth sailed on a ship"},"657":{"dur":3,"text":"called \"The Entrepreneurship\"\nin March 2013."},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"Just a fascinating experience."},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"So we passed glaciers\nin Patagonia in Chile,"},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"and experienced wild waters."},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"I think we both got\nseasick at some time."},"672":{"dur":6,"text":"And we also went to Cape\nHorn with about 90 students"},"678":{"dur":4,"text":"from Chile and Stanford who\nwanted to become entrepreneurs."},"682":{"dur":3,"text":"So what did you take\naway from this experience"},"686":{"dur":1,"text":"around entrepreneurship?"},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"And how do you describe\nthat in your book?"},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"TINA SEELIG: And so this is\nsort of an interesting story."},"691":{"dur":0,"text":"I was down in Chile."},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"I do a lot of work in Chile\nwith university down there."},"695":{"dur":1,"text":"And we're partners."},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was trying to get\nthem to think really"},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"big, the sort of the moon shot."},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"They were coming\nup with all sorts"},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"of ideas for their programs\nthat were very incremental."},"705":{"dur":1,"text":"And I said you\nneed to think big."},"706":{"dur":0,"text":"You need to think."},"707":{"dur":0,"text":"what if we had a ship."},"708":{"dur":1,"text":"What if we had an\nentrepreneurship?"},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"And of course once you\ncome up with the idea"},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"for an entrepreneurship,\nyou have to do it, right?"},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"So as I write about\nin the book, this"},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"was a true entrepreneurial\nendeavor to make this happen."},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"Once we came up\nwith the idea, it"},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"was a very bold,\nnew innovative idea."},"723":{"dur":4,"text":"But getting other people\ninvolved was quite a challenge."},"728":{"dur":1,"text":"It was expensive."},"729":{"dur":1,"text":"It was politically challenging."},"731":{"dur":1,"text":"We had to recruit\nall sorts of people."},"732":{"dur":3,"text":"And it took us two years to\nmake that idea come to life."},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"But it was such a\nwonderful experience."},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"So we took, as you said,\nabout 90 students and probably"},"742":{"dur":3,"text":"around 20 faculty members from\nseveral different institutions"},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"And over the course of\nthis time together, they"},"749":{"dur":1,"text":"were given local challenges."},"751":{"dur":3,"text":"So we had people who brought\nin problems from the region."},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, how do you\nincrease ecotourism?"},"756":{"dur":5,"text":"How to help the school system\nthat was down in Chile?"},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"Taking one of the ports\nthere and figuring out"},"763":{"dur":4,"text":"how to increase their\neconomic

really remarkable ways"},"776":{"dur":1,"text":"to work together."},"777":{"dur":1,"text":"I think they didn't\nquite know how"},"779":{"dur":1,"text":"that was going to\nwork-- from very"},"781":{"dur":1,"text":"different cultures,\ndifferent languages,"},"782":{"dur":0,"text":"different backgrounds."},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"But by bringing them together\nwith very, very different"},"786":{"dur":1,"text":"points of view, they\nwere able to come up"},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"with some very exciting ideas."},"790":{"dur":0,"text":"FREDERICK: Fantastic."},"791":{"dur":4,"text":"So what's the one thing based\non what you write in your book"},"795":{"dur":3,"text":"here, \"Inside Out\" or your\nother books, what you would

come up with some very,\nvery different points of view."},"929":{"dur":2,"text":"So I can even give\nyou examples of that,"},"931":{"dur":1,"text":"where I start out\nthinking one

teaching\nin the program myself,"},"1279":{"dur":3,"text":"and found it incredibly moving."},"1282":{"dur":3,"text":"It was incredible to\nteach these men who"},"1285":{"dur":2,"text":"are hungry for

are\ngoing to be really socially"},"1299":{"dur":1,"text":"responsible?"},"1300":{"dur":3,"text":"So the students got to teach\nclasses up there and came back,"},"1304":{"dur":3,"text":"and their job

there's\nguidelines in the book."},"1330":{"dur":3,"text":"But then they also ask\nfor quantitative backing"},"1334":{"dur":0,"text":"to back it up."},"1335":{"dur":3,"text":"So is
