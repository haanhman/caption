just\nout of curiosity,"},"460":{"dur":3,"text":"have just selected an\nexternal negotiation?"},"463":{"dur":1,"text":"That was what came\nto mind when you"},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"were thinking about\na problematic one."},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"How about internal?"},"469":{"dur":3,"text":"OK, a lot of\ninternal-- and so if I"},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"ask you this question\nof if you were"},"475":{"dur":1,"text":"to make a broad\ngeneralization, just"},"477":{"dur":4,"text":"from your own experience, which\nis more problematic for you--"},"481":{"dur":3,"text":"the external

organizations,"},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"societies get to yes, from\nfamily feuds to boardroom"},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"battles, from labor\nstrikes to civil wars"},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"in different

very difficult,\nwhat I've gradually come"},"531":{"dur":5,"text":"to realize is that the\nnegotiation with ourselves--"},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"you know, what could be more\ninternal than the negotiation"},"540":{"dur":1,"text":"Because it seems\nlike we experience"},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"internal negotiations\nas more problematic,"},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"but perhaps the most

most difficult\nperson we have to deal with"},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"is-- I have to deal with,\nat least-- is right here."},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"It's myself."},"587":{"dur":4,"text":"We are, in some

will give\nyou the most trouble in life,"},"610":{"dur":3,"text":"you would not sit for a month."},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"We are often our\nown worst enemies"},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"because we human

interests."},"628":{"dur":11,"text":"And so my question is, how\ndo we turn that biggest"},"639":{"dur":5,"text":"opponent of ours into\nour biggest ally?"},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"That's what I think\nof as the process"},"647":{"dur":1,"text":"of getting to yes with yourself."},"648":{"dur":3,"text":"How do you turn your own\nopponent, yourself as opponent,"},"652":{"dur":1,"text":"into an ally?"},"653":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not easy."},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"And what I've found is\nthat what we tend to do"},"657":{"dur":4,"text":"is it's almost as if\nwe get in our own way."},"661":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's almost as if\nwe've been negotiating."},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"And the way I've tended to\nfocus on negotiation, always"},"668":{"dur":1,"text":"on the other side of the table."},"669":{"dur":1,"text":"And I realize that\npart the problem"},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"is on this side of the table."},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's almost as if we've been\nnegotiating with one arm tied"},"676":{"dur":4,"text":"behind our back because\nwe're negotiating just"},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"focused on the external,\ninfluencing the other person,"},"683":{"dur":1,"text":"when in fact our\nbiggest opportunity"},"685":{"dur":3,"text":"is to start off by influencing\nthis person right here."},"689":{"dur":5,"text":"And so what I'd like to do\nwith you for a moment is just--"},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"from that realization,\nI've kind of"},"696":{"dur":3,"text":"come to realize that getting\nto yes is an inside job."},"700":{"dur":4,"text":"And so what I'd like to do is\ntalk about how do we do that."},"704":{"dur":3,"text":"How do we handle that first\nand perhaps most important"},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"negotiation that\nwe ever engage in,"},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"the one that starts from within?"},"711":{"dur":5,"text":"What are some principles of how\ndo you get to yes with yourself"},"716":{"dur":4,"text":"as the first step towards\ngetting to yes with others?"},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"How do we do that\nin our homework?"},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"And I know here-- I\njust had the pleasure"},"725":{"dur":1,"text":"of spending several\nhours with Meng,"},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"and I know you\nhave these courses"},"729":{"dur":3,"text":"about searching Inside yourself\nand doing that work of self"},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"awareness and of attention\ntraining and so on."},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"So this will be very congruent\nwith that kind of work."},"742":{"dur":1,"text":"What I'd like to do is\njust review with you"},"744":{"dur":1,"text":"just a few principles."},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I'd like to leave\ntime for some questions,"},"747":{"dur":1,"text":"so we can go into any\nof your situations"},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"or any questions you might\nhave about negotiation."},"751":{"dur":3,"text":"But I'm going to go over\nsome principles that"},"755":{"dur":3,"text":"are the very same principles\nwe might apply outwards,"},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"but to apply them inwards first."},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"I think of them as the\npsychological antecedents"},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"to the process of\ngetting to yes."},"769":{"dur":4,"text":"So the first, and\nmaybe the foundation,"},"773":{"dur":3,"text":"that I've been teaching for\nmany years around negotiation"},"776":{"dur":2,"text":"is the ability\nto-- I like to use"},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"the metaphor of\ngoing to the balcony."},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"The balcony,\nbasically, it's almost"},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"like you're negotiating\nup here on a stage."},"787":{"dur":4,"text":"Part of your mind goes to a\nmental or emotional balcony"},"792":{"dur":3,"text":"overlooking that stage, which\nis a place of perspective."},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a place of calm."},"797":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a place of clarity."},"798":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a place of self control."},"801":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a place where you can\nkeep your eyes on the prize,"},"805":{"dur":2,"text":"because so often,\nwe're reacting."},"807":{"dur":1,"text":"We're often reacting\nout of fear."},"809":{"dur":1,"text":"We're reacting out of anger."},"811":{"dur":3,"text":"And as the old saying\ngoes, when angry,"},"814":{"dur":4,"text":"you will make the best\nspeech you will ever regret."},"818":{"dur":5,"text":"And we sometimes get brought\ninto a process of either"},"823":{"dur":3,"text":"attacking

tendency to avoid?"},"858":{"dur":5,"text":"OK, and sometimes we use a\ncombination of all of them."},"864":{"dur":3,"text":"We may accommodate for a\nlong time with our child,"},"867":{"dur":2,"text":"and then we suddenly lose it."},"869":{"dur":1,"text":"You've been to that\nmovie, you know?"},"871":{"dur":2,"text":"And then we attack, and\nthen we go back to avoiding."},"876":{"dur":1,"text":"The question is, is\nthere a better way?"},"878":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think there\nis a better way"},"879":{"dur":1,"text":"of getting to yes, which\nis actually engaging"},"881":{"dur":1,"text":"the differences in\na constructive way."},"883":{"dur":1,"text":"But in order to do\nthat, it requires"},"885":{"dur":1,"text":"us to go to the

of feel\nticked off and irritated."},"912":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's just very natural\nto compose a reply."},"916":{"dur":1,"text":"You get that\ninstant satisfaction"},"918":{"dur":1,"text":"of hitting the Reply button."},"919":{"dur":1,"text":"But you don't just\nhit the Reply button,"},"921":{"dur":2,"text":"you hit the Reply All button."},"923":{"dur":2,"text":"And then it goes out to\nthe entire organization"},"926":{"dur":2,"text":"and you start to see\nconflicts start to escalate."},"929":{"dur":3,"text":"There is a button on that\nscreen that is often rarely used"},"932":{"dur":1,"text":"that I think of as\nthe balcony button,"},"934":{"dur":3,"text":"and it says, Save as Draft."},"937":{"dur":2,"text":"That's the one where you\nget it out of your system."},"939":{"dur":1,"text":"You save it as a draft."},"941":{"dur":2,"text":"Then everyone has their\nfavorite techniques"},"943":{"dur":1,"text":"for going to the balcony."},"944":{"dur":2,"text":"Some people might, you\nknow, breathe or meditate."},"947":{"dur":3,"text":"Some people might go for a walk\nin these lovely

minutes"},"956":{"dur":0,"text":"or a few hours."},"957":{"dur":1,"text":"You're going to\nlook at that email"},"958":{"dur":2,"text":"and you're going to ask\nyourself the important question."},"961":{"dur":3,"text":"Is this going to\nadvance my interests?"},"964":{"dur":3,"text":"Is this really going to serve\nthe needs of the situation?"},"967":{"dur":3,"text":"And most likely

however"},"975":{"dur":1,"text":"to try to resolve the situation."},"977":{"dur":3,"text":"Because email as it turns\nout, while it's a great way"},"980":{"dur":3,"text":"to convey information,\nis not such a great way"},"984":{"dur":3,"text":"to deal with anything\nthat's emotionally delicate."},"987":{"dur":5,"text":"So those are all ways\nof going to the balcony."},"992":{"dur":1,"text":"But

natural."},"998":{"dur":2,"text":"And so the question is how\ncan we say on the balcony?"},"1000":{"dur":4,"text":"And so this brings me\nto the next principle,"},"1004":{"dur":2,"text":"which is one
