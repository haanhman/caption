that's\nreally a great question."},"2635":{"dur":3,"text":"I guess my first\nanswer is probably one"},"2639":{"dur":2,"text":"that maybe I shouldn't\nthink of as a teacher,"},"2641":{"dur":4,"text":"but not listening\nto their teachers."},"2645":{"dur":4,"text":"Alexander was famously taught\nby Aristotle, the philosopher."},"2650":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think

conclusions"},"2659":{"dur":2,"text":"that Aristotle\nwanted him to reach."},"2662":{"dur":2,"text":"Aristotle was a great\nthinker, but Aristotle"},"2664":{"dur":1,"text":"was quite an

all."},"2679":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, he wanted to create\na new ruling group that mixed"},"2683":{"dur":2,"text":"Greeks with Iranians."},"2685":{"dur":2,"text":"So Aristotle wouldn't have\nbeen

the paradigms\nrather than the content."},"2705":{"dur":1,"text":"Looks like we have a\nquestion from the audience."},"2707":{"dur":1,"text":"Thanks for an interesting talk."},"2709":{"dur":2,"text":"I think I'd like to\nwork with Hannibal."},"2711":{"dur":2,"text":"He seemed the most interesting."},"2714":{"dur":2,"text":"One of the leaders around\nSilicon Valley that's fairly"},"2716":{"dur":1,"text":"well known is Steve Jobs."},"2718":{"dur":3,"text":"Could you briefly compare\nhis leadership style"},"2722":{"dur":2,"text":"with that of the

his desire to build\nsomething very big,"},"2739":{"dur":6,"text":"and also, I suppose,\nin the sense"},"2746":{"dur":7,"text":"that he wasn't worried\nabout who he might

left\nyou with the idea"},"2761":{"dur":3,"text":"that these commanders\nwere nice folks,"},"2765":{"dur":1,"text":"because they were ruthless."},"2767":{"dur":4,"text":"And Steve Jobs was\ncertainly ruthless."},"2771":{"dur":2,"text":"But I think all\nthree of them-- what"},"2774":{"dur":2,"text":"they share with\nSteve Jobs is there's"},"2776":{"dur":3,"text":"a visionary quality\nto what they did."},"2780":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that Caesar\nin particular"},"2782":{"dur":4,"text":"understood that the Roman\nRepublic was simply incapable"},"2786":{"dur":1,"text":"of dealing with\nthe Roman Empire."},"2788":{"dur":3,"text":"The Romans had conquered\nmaybe 50 million people"},"2792":{"dur":1,"text":"at this point in history."},"2793":{"dur":2,"text":"And yet the defenders\nof the republic"},"2796":{"dur":2,"text":"thought that a few hundred\nfamilies, descended"},"2798":{"dur":1,"text":"from the Roman\nnobility, could go"},"2800":{"dur":3,"text":"on governing 50 million people\naround the Mediterranean world"},"2804":{"dur":3,"text":"without sharing power in any\nmeaningful way with this wider"},"2807":{"dur":0,"text":"group."},"2808":{"dur":3,"text":"I think Caesar understood\nthat that was not acceptable"},"2812":{"dur":1,"text":"and that they really\nneeded to shift"},"2813":{"dur":2,"text":"the paradigm in massive ways."},"2815":{"dur":2,"text":"It's one of the reasons why\nhe was so controversial,"},"2818":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's one of the reasons why\nhe gets killed-- because people"},"2821":{"dur":2,"text":"don't want to share power."},"2824":{"dur":3,"text":"Likewise, Caesar was\nahead of his time--"},"2827":{"dur":2,"text":"perhaps not in such a good\nway-- in that he believed"},"2829":{"dur":3,"text":"that monarchy was really\nthe only way to run Rome,"},"2833":{"dur":3,"text":"and that the Republic, which\nwas kind of ruled by committee,"},"2836":{"dur":2,"text":"was not something\nthat can continue."},"2839":{"dur":3,"text":"Steve Jobs clearly is\nalso a visionary person."},"2843":{"dur":3,"text":"And like Caesar, I think\nhe saw that people--"},"2850":{"dur":2,"text":"he saw something that\npeople needed before they"},"2852":{"dur":1,"text":"knew they needed it."},"2854":{"dur":1,"text":"They shared that in common."},"2855":{"dur":1,"text":"But you asked about Hannibal."},"2857":{"dur":2,"text":"So a way in which Steve\nJobs is similar to Hannibal"},"2860":{"dur":3,"text":"is they both saw\nthemselves as liberators."},"2863":{"dur":2,"text":"They both saw themselves\nwho were freeing people"},"2866":{"dur":3,"text":"and who were going to create\na better world in that sense."},"2869":{"dur":2,"text":"Hannibal really didn't\nwant to destroy Rome."},"2871":{"dur":3,"text":"He had no intention of\nburning Rome to the ground."},"2875":{"dur":3,"text":"He wanted the Romans to simply\nagree to give up their power"},"2878":{"dur":3,"text":"and admit the fact\nthat they were beat"},"2882":{"dur":2,"text":"and that he had defeated them."},"2885":{"dur":2,"text":"So he wanted to--"},"2888":{"dur":1,"text":"he was not a destroyer."},"2889":{"dur":1,"text":"He saw himself as a builder."},"2890":{"dur":1,"text":"So maybe in that sense,\nsomething in common"},"2892":{"dur":2,"text":"with Steve Jobs as well."},"2894":{"dur":2,"text":"PRESENTER: Question\nfor you on the brand"},"2897":{"dur":1,"text":"that seems so strong\nfor all of them."},"2898":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is obviously a\ntime before there was"},"2900":{"dur":1,"text":"widespread internet technology."},"2902":{"dur":1,"text":"And a couple of the\nways that you highlight"},"2904":{"dur":1,"text":"that they spread\ntheir personal brand"},"2906":{"dur":1,"text":"was through and public artwork."},"2908":{"dur":3,"text":"Were there other techniques they\nemployed to get the word out"},"2911":{"dur":1,"text":"and recruit people\nto their armies?"},"2913":{"dur":1,"text":"BARRY STRAUSS: Yes."},"2915":{"dur":1,"text":"So great question."},"2916":{"dur":3,"text":"Cesar, again, is a really\ngood example of this,"},"2920":{"dur":2,"text":"because he writes these books--"},"2922":{"dur":1,"text":"the first campaign\nbooks, if you will--"},"2924":{"dur":2,"text":"the commentaries on the\nGallic Wars and commentary"},"2927":{"dur":1,"text":"on the Civil War."},"2928":{"dur":2,"text":"And these books are\nwritten as annual reports"},"2931":{"dur":2,"text":"that he sends home to Rome."},"2933":{"dur":4,"text":"And they are read\nby people in public."},"2937":{"dur":3,"text":"And they are ways to\ngive certain messages--"},"2940":{"dur":2,"text":"one, that Caesar is\nreally doing great things"},"2943":{"dur":3,"text":"for the Roman people, two, that\nCaesar is a friend of the Roman"},"2946":{"dur":3,"text":"people, and three, that you\ndon't want to mess with Caesar."},"2949":{"dur":3,"text":"These are the messages that\nhe's sending home in that way."},"2953":{"dur":3,"text":"Another way in which people\ncommunicate their message"},"2957":{"dur":1,"text":"was through religion."},"2958":{"dur":2,"text":"Religion was very\nimportant for all of them."},"2961":{"dur":3,"text":"Hannibal associating\nhimself with Hercules"},"2964":{"dur":3,"text":"before he goes on his\nmission of conquest--"},"2967":{"dur":3,"text":"he goes to the Temple of\nHercules on the Atlantic Ocean,"},"2971":{"dur":2,"text":"and he lets it be\nknown that he's"},"2973":{"dur":3,"text":"in touch with Hercules himself\nbefore he goes on that mission."},"2976":{"dur":3,"text":"He also has visions, and he lets\npeople know about his dreams"},"2980":{"dur":2,"text":"and visions everywhere he goes."},"2983":{"dur":5,"text":"So that is another way\nto get the message out."},"2988":{"dur":1,"text":"PRESENTER: So some\nof the companies"},"2990":{"dur":3,"text":"that we see more and more in the\nmodern era have a somewhat less"},"2994":{"dur":2,"text":"hierarchical structure,\nespecially in Silicon

would you\ndraw between the cultures"},"3003":{"dur":2,"text":"that they tried to\nintentionally create?"},"3005":{"dur":2,"text":"Were they more or\nless hierarchical?"},"3008":{"dur":2,"text":"Did it depend on the leader?"},"3010":{"dur":0,"text":"BARRY STRAUSS: Yeah."},"3011":{"dur":1,"text":"Obviously, there's\na long, long way"},"3012":{"dur":2,"text":"from these armies\nto Silicon Valley."},"3015":{"dur":5,"text":"But the one way in which I think\nthere is something similar--"},"3020":{"dur":1,"text":"particularly,\nagain, with Caesar--"},"3021":{"dur":4,"text":"is the attempt to reach\noutside of the narrow circles"},"3025":{"dur":3,"text":"of the senior officers to\nfind out what should be done."},"3029":{"dur":3,"text":"It was really very unusual\nfor the commanding officer"},"3032":{"dur":2,"text":"to say I want to\ntake these captains,"},"3034":{"dur":2,"text":"and I want them to\nbe in the meeting"},"3036":{"dur":3,"text":"when we decide what to do."},"3039":{"dur":1,"text":"That really is very unusual."},"3041":{"dur":2,"text":"And then to write\nbooks in which he"},"3043":{"dur":3,"text":"advertises to people that\nhe's talking to the captains--"},"3047":{"dur":3,"text":"again, that is a very\nunusual thing to do."},"3051":{"dur":2,"text":"Caesar's own style\nwas not particularly"},"3054":{"dur":2,"text":"approachable or personable."},"3056":{"dur":4,"text":"But in practice,\nin his own way, he"},"3061":{"dur":3,"text":"was reaching out to a much\nwider group of people."},"3064":{"dur":6,"text":"Likewise, Caesar, in\nterms of his advisors,"},"3071":{"dur":4,"text":"he's reaching outside of the\nusual circle of the Roman"},"3075":{"dur":0,"text":"nobility."},"3076":{"dur":2,"text":"He's consulting foreigners,\nand he brings them"},"3078":{"dur":2,"text":"into his inner\ncircle, or people who"},"3081":{"dur":2,"text":"were foreigners who had been\ngiven the Roman citizenship."},"3084":{"dur":1,"text":"Because Romans did that."},"3086":{"dur":2,"text":"And he makes them some\nof his chief advisers."},"3088":{"dur":2,"text":"This is shocking\nto traditionalists,"},"3091":{"dur":3,"text":"but it is a way in which he's\nflattening his organization"},"3094":{"dur":1,"text":"just a little bit."},"3096":{"dur":3,"text":"Alexander also is reaching\nout to foreigners."},"3100":{"dur":3,"text":"He's horrifying\ntraditionalists from Macedon"},"3103":{"dur":2,"text":"who are saying, hey,\nwe thought that we"},"3105":{"dur":1,"text":"were going to be the rulers."},"3107":{"dur":1,"text":"What does this mean\nthat you are talking"},"3109":{"dur":1,"text":"to people who we've conquered?"},"3110":{"dur":4,"text":"And Alexander marries women\namong the conquered people."},"3115":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's also a way in which\nhe's reaching out and shocking"},"3118":{"dur":1,"text":"and horrifying his

for their time."},"3124":{"dur":1,"text":"PRESENTER: One last\nquestion, then."},"3126":{"dur":3,"text":"You mentioned that they had,\nobviously, their qualities that"},"3129":{"dur":1,"text":"allowed them to inspire\nfollowership, and be"},"3131":{"dur":3,"text":"great leaders, and have\nvery impressive victories"},"3134":{"dur":3,"text":"and conquests in\nmultiethnic
