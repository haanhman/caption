story."},"537":{"dur":5,"text":"What do you think today is a bigger killer\nthan a lifetime of smoking?"},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"It's loneliness."},"547":{"dur":4,"text":"According to government

people,"},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"doesn't speak to anyone else in a month."},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"And we're not the only people\nwith this problem;"},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"this problem touches the whole\nof the Western world."},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's even more acute\nin countries like China,"},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"where a process of rapid urbanization,\nmass migration, has left older people"},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"alone in the villages."},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"And so the services that Beveridge\ndesigned and exported --"},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"they can't address this kind of problem."},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"Loneliness is like a collective\nrelational challenge,"},"584":{"dur":3,"text":"and it can't be addressed\nby a traditional bureaucratic response."},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"So some years ago,\nwanting to understand this problem,"},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"I started to work with a group\nof about 60 older people"},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"in South London, where I live."},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"I went shopping, I played bingo,"},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"but mainly I was just\nobserving and listening."},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"I wanted to know\nwhat we could do differently."},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you ask them, people tell you\nthey want two things."},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"They want somebody to go up a ladder\nand change a light bulb,"},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"or to be there when they\ncome out of hospital."},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"They want on-demand, practical support."},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"And they want to have fun."},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"They want to go out, do interesting things\nwith like-minded people,"},"619":{"dur":3,"text":"and make friends like we've all\nmade friends at every stage of our lives."},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"So we rented a phone line,\nhired a couple of handymen,"},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"and started a service we called \"Circle.\""},"628":{"dur":3,"text":"And Circle offers its local membership\na toll-free 0 800 number"},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"that they can call on demand\nfor any support."},"635":{"dur":2,"text":"And people have called us\nfor so many reasons."},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"They've called because\ntheir pets are unwell,"},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"their DVD is broken, they've forgotten\nhow to use their mobile phone,"},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"or maybe they are coming out of hospital"},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"and they want someone to be there."},"646":{"dur":3,"text":"And Circle also offers\na rich social calendar --"},"649":{"dur":4,"text":"knitting, darts, museum tours,\nhot air ballooning -- you name it."},"654":{"dur":4,"text":"But here's the interesting thing,\nthe really deep change:"},"658":{"dur":3,"text":"over time, the friendships\nthat have formed"},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"have begun to replace the practical offer."},"664":{"dur":1,"text":"So let me tell you about Belinda."},"666":{"dur":4,"text":"Belinda's a Circle member, and she was\ngoing into hospital for a hip operation,"},"670":{"dur":3,"text":"so she called her local Circle to say\nthey wouldn't see her for a bit."},"674":{"dur":3,"text":"And Damon, who runs the local Circle,\ncalls her back and says, \"How can I help?\""},"678":{"dur":1,"text":"And Belinda says, \"Oh no, I'm fine

five Circle members\nhad organized themselves"},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"to take care of Belinda."},"692":{"dur":3,"text":"And Belinda's 80, although she says\nthat she feels 25 inside,"},"695":{"dur":1,"text":"but she also says"},"697":{"dur":3,"text":"that she felt stuck and pretty down\nwhen she joined Circle."},"701":{"dur":4,"text":"But the simple act of encouraging her\nto come along to that first event"},"705":{"dur":3,"text":"led to a process where\nnatural friendships formed,"},"708":{"dur":4,"text":"friendships that today are replacing\nthe need for expensive services."},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"It's relationships\nthat are making the difference."},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think that three factors\nhave converged"},"720":{"dur":2,"text":"that enable us to put relationships\nat the heart and center"},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"of how we solve social problems today."},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"Firstly, the nature of the problems --"},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"they've changed, and they require\ndifferent solutions."},"731":{"dur":4,"text":"Secondly, the cost, human as much\nas financial, of doing business as usual."},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"And thirdly, technology."},"738":{"dur":2,"text":"I've talked about the first two factors."},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"It's technology that enables\nthese approaches to scale"},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"and potentially now support\nthousands of people."},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"So the technology we've used\nis really simple,"},"749":{"dur":3,"text":"it's made up of available things\nlike databases, mobile phones."},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"Circle has got this very simple\nsystem that underpins it,"},"755":{"dur":3,"text":"enables a small local team to support\na membership of up to a thousand."},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can contrast this\nwith a neighborhood organization"},"762":{"dur":1,"text":"of the 1970s,"},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"when this kind of scale\njust wasn't possible,"},"765":{"dur":4,"text":"neither was the quality or the longevity\nthat the spine of technology can provide."},"769":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's relationships\nunderpinned by technology"},"772":{"dur":2,"text":"that can turn the Beveridge\nmodels on their heads."},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"The Beveridge models are all\nabout institutions with finite resources,"},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"anonymously managing access."},"781":{"dur":1,"text":"In my work at the front line,"},"783":{"dur":3,"text":"I've seen again and again how\nup to 80 percent of resource"},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"is spent keeping people out."},"789":{"dur":1,"text":"So professionals have to administer"},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"these increasingly complex forms\nof administration"},"793":{"dur":3,"text":"that are basically about stopping people\naccessing the service"},"796":{"dur":1,"text":"or managing the queue."},"798":{"dur":4,"text":"And Circle, like the relational services\nthat we and others have designed,"},"803":{"dur":1,"text":"inverts this logic."},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"What it says is, the more people,\nthe more relationships,"},"808":{"dur":2,"text":"the stronger the solution."},"811":{"dur":2,"text":"So I want to tell you my third\nand final story,"},"814":{"dur":1,"text":"which is about unemployment."},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"In Britain, as in most places\nin the world,"},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"our welfare states were primarily designed"},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"to get people into work,"},"825":{"dur":1,"text":"to educate them for this,"},"827":{"dur":1,"text":"and to keep them healthy."},"829":{"dur":2,"text":"But here, too, the systems are failing."},"831":{"dur":1,"text":"And so the response has been"},"832":{"dur":3,"text":"to try and make these old systems\neven more efficient and transactional --"},"836":{"dur":3,"text":"to speed up processing times, divide\npeople into ever-smaller categories,"},"840":{"dur":3,"text":"try and target services at them\nmore efficiently -- in other words,"},"843":{"dur":2,"text":"the very opposite of relational."},"847":{"dur":3,"text":"But guess how most people find work today?"},"851":{"dur":1,"text":"Through word of mouth."},"853":{"dur":4,"text":"It turns out that in Britain today,\nmost new jobs are not advertised."},"858":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's friends that tell you about a job,"},"860":{"dur":2,"text":"it's friends that recommend you for a job,"},"862":{"dur":4,"text":"and it's a rich and diverse social network\nthat helps you find work."},"866":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe some of you here\nthis evening are thinking,"},"869":{"dur":1,"text":"\"But I found my job through an advert,\""},"871":{"dur":3,"text":"but if you think back, it was probably\na friend that showed you the ad"},"874":{"dur":1,"text":"and then encouraged you to apply."},"875":{"dur":1,"text":"But not surprisingly,"},"877":{"dur":3,"text":"people who perhaps most need\nthis rich and diverse network"},"880":{"dur":2,"text":"are those who are most isolated from it."},"883":{"dur":1,"text":"So knowing this,"},"884":{"dur":3,"text":"and also knowing about the costs\nand failure of current systems,"},"887":{"dur":2,"text":"we designed something new\nwith relationships at its heart."},"890":{"dur":5,"text":"We designed a service\nthat encourages people to meet up,"},"896":{"dur":1,"text":"people in and out of work,"},"897":{"dur":1,"text":"to work together in structured ways"},"899":{"dur":1,"text":"and try new opportunities."},"902":{"dur":3,"text":"And, well, it's very hard to compare\nthe results of these new systems"},"906":{"dur":1,"text":"with the old transactional models,"},"907":{"dur":2,"text":"but it looks like,\nwith our first 1,000 members,"},"910":{"dur":2,"text":"we outperformed existing services\nby a factor of three,"},"913":{"dur":1,"text":"at a fraction of the cost."},"915":{"dur":2,"text":"And here, too, we've used technology,"},"918":{"dur":3,"text":"but not to network people in the way\nthat a social platform would do."},"921":{"dur":3,"text":"We've used it to bring people face to face\nand connect them with each other,"},"925":{"dur":3,"text":"building real relationships\nand supporting people to find work."},"930":{"dur":2,"text":"At the end of his life, in 1948,"},"933":{"dur":1,"text":"Beveridge wrote a third report."},"935":{"dur":3,"text":"And in it he said he had made\na dreadful
