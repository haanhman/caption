As you can see, this"},"166":{"dur":2,"text":"is why you should because different companies"},"168":{"dur":1,"text":"have different laws of things like drinking"},"170":{"dur":7,"text":"alcohol. We're going to leave it as just \"anyone\""},"177":{"dur":3,"text":"because SEO is suitable for anyone. So once"},"180":{"dur":2,"text":"you've clicked that and agreed to the terms,"},"182":{"dur":7,"text":"you click create. Now the profile's starting to"},"190":{"dur":2,"text":"be created now. We've got to start with what's"},"192":{"dur":2,"text":"known as the \"Tagline\". This is displayed just"},"195":{"dur":1,"text":"under the company name and should be something"},"197":{"dur":3,"text":"that's catchy, something that's more promotional"},"201":{"dur":6,"text":"than optimised to bring in the customers."},"207":{"dur":3,"text":"For our tagline, we'll leave it as something like"},"210":{"dur":6,"text":"\"Here at Example SEO, your success is our"},"216":{"dur":3,"text":"success.\" So it's something nice, short, sweet"},"220":{"dur":4,"text":"and catchy, yet it has \"SEO\" in the title."},"225":{"dur":3,"text":"So if we were a real SEO company, if Example was"},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"a real SEO company, then that would be a keyword"},"230":{"dur":1,"text":"they would be targeting, so it's always good"},"232":{"dur":3,"text":"to include it in your profile. Now the next thing"},"235":{"dur":2,"text":"we need to do is add a profile picture, which"},"238":{"dur":1,"text":"couldn't be more simple. Once you've clicked that"},"240":{"dur":5,"text":"do is just as it says really, drag an image over"},"245":{"dur":4,"text":"to it. If you don't want to drag one, you could"},"250":{"dur":1,"text":"select it and then browse through your computer"},"252":{"dur":4,"text":"but I find this way to be easier. Once it's"},"256":{"dur":1,"text":"uploaded, you'll want to crop it to the right"},"258":{"dur":1,"text":"dimensions to make sure that all of the"},"260":{"dur":4,"text":"image is shown. Usually this profile picture"},"264":{"dur":2,"text":"would be a company logo or something similar."},"267":{"dur":5,"text":"We'll add the caption of well, exactly that,"},"273":{"dur":11,"text":"we'll put \"Example SEO Company Logo.\""},"284":{"dur":2,"text":"Once you've set that as your profile picture,"},"286":{"dur":1,"text":"you can move on, you just have to click"},"288":{"dur":5,"text":"continue.

Once you've"},"327":{"dur":1,"text":"done that, you click \"finish\". The first thing I"},"329":{"dur":6,"text":"usually do when creating profiles is to get the"},"335":{"dur":5,"text":"Google+ badge. You get this badge to display"},"341":{"dur":3,"text":"it on your website. This is the default layout"},"344":{"dur":4,"text":"for the Google+ badge. There's a lot of"},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"parameters that you can alter to make it your"},"351":{"dur":3,"text":"own and make it fit in with your website. To"},"354":{"dur":1,"text":"start with, I'm not going to have it in Arabic"},"356":{"dur":1,"text":"because I'm based in the UK. So I'll change this"},"357":{"dur":9,"text":"to English. Right now you can change it from the"},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"standard size, which will appear to be about"},"368":{"dur":1,"text":"that big. Or you could make it a smaller badge,"},"370":{"dur":5,"text":"or you could even just make it as big as an icon."},"376":{"dur":2,"text":"For this, we'll use the standard badge."},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"For the developers out there, you have these"},"381":{"dur":3,"text":"advanced options that let you even further define"},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"what you want your badge to look like. You can"},"388":{"dur":3,"text":"actually alter the size, the colour themes. You"},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"can have it as light as it's displayed there, or"},"394":{"dur":1,"text":"you can have it as dark. That would depend on"},"396":{"dur":3,"text":"the layout and style of your website entirely."},"400":{"dur":4,"text":"You should always leave this box ticked."},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"If you have an HTML5 site, then it might be worth"},"408":{"dur":3,"text":"ticking this box. That's because it's going to"},"411":{"dur":6,"text":"add it in HTML 5 valid syntax. This is the code"},"417":{"dur":5,"text":"for your actual badge. It is more for the"},"423":{"dur":4,"text":"development side. You'll want to grab from here,"},"428":{"dur":3,"text":"to here and place this is the <head> tag of your"},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"website. Either in your template, or whichever"},"433":{"dur":3,"text":"individual page you want the badge to appear on."},"437":{"dur":1,"text":"Once you've done that, you get this part of the"},"439":{"dur":4,"text":"code. Then copy and paste that into where on your"},"443":{"dur":1,"text":"website you want the badge to be displayed."},"445":{"dur":6,"text":"Simple enough really. So once you've got the"},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"code and added it to your site, you can carry on"},"453":{"dur":4,"text":"with optimising your profile page. Now that we've"},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"created it, we can go to the profile and you"},"461":{"dur":3,"text":"can do that by clicking on the name here, or this"},"464":{"dur":3,"text":"little icon here. Click on the name and it will"},"467":{"dur":1,"text":"take you to this page. As you can see, it's quite"},"469":{"dur":3,"text":"empty at this time but that will change. We'll"},"473":{"dur":5,"text":"go to \"Edit Profile\" at the top. To begin with,"},"478":{"dur":1,"text":"we'll add an introduction. As it says here, \"put"},"480":{"dur":1,"text":"a little about your page here so people will"},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"know they've found the correct Example SEO.\" So"},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"that can be anything really, it's doesn't have to"},"486":{"dur":6,"text":"be too long but it is advised to do quite a bit,"},"493":{"dur":33,"text":"but not too much. So let's say \"This is the"},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"Google+ page for Example SEO, a professional"},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"SEO and Internet marketing company based in"},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"Blackburn.\" Something that's nice, short, sweet"},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"and sticks to the point really. It gives enough"},"538":{"dur":3,"text":"description so whoever's on the page will realise"},"541":{"dur":4,"text":"what this kind of page is straight away. After"},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"you save that, you move down to contact"},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"info. It's important to put as many of these in"},"550":{"dur":3,"text":"as you can. As you can see, there's a little box"},"554":{"dur":1,"text":"here that says \"phone\", once you click this, a"},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"drop down box appears with all these different"},"557":{"dur":4,"text":"contact options. As I've already said, it's"},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"important to add as many of these as you can"},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"because not only is that better for the end user,"},"566":{"dur":4,"text":"because it's giving more ways to contact you, but"},"570":{"dur":1,"text":"it's better for Google because Google just like"},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"as much detail as possible on this front. For"},"574":{"dur":3,"text":"this, we'll add the Weblinx number that's \"01254"},"577":{"dur":8,"text":"267360\". Aside from that, you can add more"},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"mobile numbers or email addresses. Once you've"},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"added an email address, you can go on to the page"},"591":{"dur":3,"text":"and you should actually get it verified. To do"},"594":{"dur":3,"text":"that, you click next to the email adress because"},"597":{"dur":1,"text":"there's a little tick and then it'll send the"},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"email address an email with a verification link."},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"Once you've clicked that, your email is verified."},"605":{"dur":1,"text":"A verified email will always look better than an"},"607":{"dur":5,"text":"unverified one. The address is something that is"},"612":{"dur":3,"text":"extremely important if you're targeting local"},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"terms and going for local SEO so once again, I'll"},"619":{"dur":25,"text":"use the Weblinx details. It's the \"Blackburn"},"645":{"dur":1,"text":"Technology Centre, Challenge Way, Blackburn, BB1"},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"5QB.\" Once I've added that, I'll click \"save\"."},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"Where you entered the website earlier, is being"},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"displayed here. It's worth mentioning that with"},"653":{"dur":3,"text":"Google+ unlike a lot of other social networks,"},"657":{"dur":3,"text":"the links that are displayed on any profiles are"},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"all followed links. Which means that the Google"},"662":{"dur":1,"text":"spiders will actually follow them and crawl the"},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"pages that they're attached to. A very very"},"667":{"dur":3,"text":"useful tool. If you can see this recommended"},"670":{"dur":5,"text":"links section here, this is supposed to be links"},"676":{"dur":3,"text":"that this profile is recommending. This is used"},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"for a lot of different types of links. We use it"},"682":{"dur":3,"text":"for our social media links so we've linked our"},"685":{"dur":4,"text":"other social media accounts to this page and also"},"689":{"dur":3,"text":"our blog links. For the purpose of example, we'll"},"692":{"dur":4,"text":"just add a link to the Weblinx Blog. The label"},"696":{"dur":4,"text":"is the text that will appear in front of the link."},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"So if we're linking to the Weblinx Blog, we'll"},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"make the label as relevant as possible and just"},"705":{"dur":15,"text":"call it \"The Weblinx Blog.\". next you enter the URL"},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"If you wanted to add more, you just click"},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"\"add custom link\" so you can add as many"},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"as you like. Although it's worth being cautious"},"727":{"dur":3,"text":"because if you add too many links and they're"},"730":{"dur":3,"text":"all irrelevant, people might not like it as much"},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"and it might not give you the interest you're"},"736":{"dur":7,"text":"looking for. Once you've saved that, this is"},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"where you start to add a bit more personalisation"},"745":{"dur":3,"text":"to your profile. If you can see this top along"},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"here, this is known as \"The Scrapbook Photos\""},"751":{"dur":3,"text":"This stores 5 photos across here and can be used"},"755":{"dur":2,"text":"for anything from adding a team page, to a"},"757":{"dur":3,"text":"graph, to loads of things really. We'll click on"},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"this just to show you how it works and how"},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"they're uploaded. So once you've clicked on that,"},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"it comes up here \"Add a Photo\". So click on that"},"768":{"dur":2,"text":"and it works in the same way that it did when we"},"771":{"dur":3,"text":"were adding the profile picture. We'll just drag"},"774":{"dur":10,"text":"a picture across and upload it. If you've"},"785":{"dur":3,"text":"noticed, it's on public. You can change these"},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"settings but we're going to leave it on public,"},"791":{"dur":2,"text":"thus to increase exposure. You can carry on and"},"794":{"dur":2,"text":"add up to 5 photos on here. We're just going to"},"796":{"dur":5,"text":"add 1. So after you click continue, you can see"},"802":{"dur":6,"text":"how it is displayed. Next is adding photos."},"809":{"dur":6,"text":"This works in the exact same way."},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're on \"Edit Profile\" and you go on to the"},"818":{"dur":3,"text":"photos tab, it'll give you a variety of options"},"821":{"dur":3,"text":"you can use to change how Google detects photos"},"824":{"dur":4,"text":"of me. This isn't as useful with business pages"},"829":{"dur":5,"text":"as it is with personal pages because a lot of it"},"834":{"dur":1,"text":"is because of this option, the \"Find my face in"},"835":{"dur":1,"text":"photos and prompt people I know to tag me.\""},"837":{"dur":2,"text":"option. This is because if you're a company,"},"839":{"dur":3,"text":"you don't really have a face. We'll click"},"842":{"dur":3,"text":"finished editing because the \"About Us\" is done"},"845":{"dur":3,"text":"To upload photos, you go to \"photos\", and simply"},"849":{"dur":7,"text":"go on \"upload new photos\". This is where you"},"856":{"dur":4,"text":"get to design an album name. A lot of companies"},"860":{"dur":5,"text":"would use this for, well it depends entirely on"},"866":{"dur":1,"text":"what industry you're in. So if you're a web"},"867":{"dur":1,"text":"design company, you might upload an album"},"869":{"dur":2,"text":"entitled \"Web Design Portfolio\" where you only"},"872":{"dur":4,"text":"upload images of the websites you've designed."},"876":{"dur":2,"text":"It works in the exact same way as whenever you've"},"879":{"dur":1,"text":"uploaded anything else. You just drag a file into"},"880":{"dur":5,"text":"the area and it uploads. It works in the exact"},"885":{"dur":5,"text":"same way for videos. You can even create albums"},"891":{"dur":5,"text":"for videos as well. Right now we're coming into"},"896":{"dur":4,"text":"circles, now Google+ have made circles in replace"},"901":{"dur":5,"text":"of friends or followers on Twitter. The aim of"},"906":{"dur":2,"text":"circles is to sort of be a hybrid between"},"908":{"dur":2,"text":"Facebook friends and Twitter followers."},"911":{"dur":4,"text":"This is because they are 'friends' but people can"},"916":{"dur":2,"text":"add other people and follow them without actually"},"919":{"dur":8,"text":"having to have had them in their friends already."},"927":{"dur":7,"text":"We'll go on circles now. As you can see, Google"},"935":{"dur":1,"text":"have already given us 4 circles to add people to"},"936":{"dur":0,"text":"so that's \"Following\", \"Customers\", \"VIPs\" and"},"937":{"dur":0,"text":"\"Team Members\". Now following, that kind of"},"938":{"dur":5,"text":"circle would be just for, like on Twitter when"},"944":{"dur":1,"text":"people follow celebrities and such. It might not"},"945":{"dur":1,"text":"be people we personally know but you might be"},"947":{"dur":2,"text":"interested in their posts. Then you have your"},"949":{"dur":2,"text":"customers, which is pretty self explanetory."},"951":{"dur":0,"text":"Then you've got the VIPs and Team Members."},"952":{"dur":2,"text":"To create a new circle for something specific"},"955":{"dur":3,"text":"you want, just hover over this far left circle"},"959":{"dur":3,"text":"called \"Create a circle\". For the purpose of the"},"962":{"dur":8,"text":"video, we'll call it business partnerships."},"970":{"dur":1,"text":"So once you've typed in the name of the circle,"},"972":{"dur":3,"text":"you click \"create empty circle\"."},"976":{"dur":1,"text":"Now we've done this, you can see it appearing"},"977":{"dur":4,"text":"right here. But how do we add someone to it?"},"982":{"dur":1,"text":"Well I'll show you."},"984":{"dur":3,"text":"With Google+, unlike other social networks,"},"987":{"dur":4,"text":"if you're a business page, you can't add people"},"992":{"dur":1,"text":"or personal pages without them already adding"},"994":{"dur":1,"text":"you first. But you can add other businesses."},"996":{"dur":7,"text":"So this is why I've searched for Weblinx."},"1003":{"dur":2,"text":"If I was to go in to the Weblinx profile, see up"},"1006":{"dur":2,"text":"here there's a little red box that says \"follow\""},"1009":{"dur":4,"text":"If you highlight over that, a drop box will appear"},"1014":{"dur":4,"text":"Simply choose which circle to add them to."},"1018":{"dur":3,"text":"So if I add them to the business partnerships,"},"1021":{"dur":4,"text":"it tells you what happens and how it communicates."},"1025":{"dur":1,"text":"And also what they will see and what you will"},"1027":{"dur":3,"text":"see etc. Okay I've got that. Now you can see"},"1030":{"dur":3,"text":"it's turned green and says business partnerships."},"1034":{"dur":1,"text":"That's because it's in our business partnerships"},"1035":{"dur":5,"text":"circle. The thing about Google+ is you can add"},"1040":{"dur":3,"text":"people to more than one circle which makes"},"1044":{"dur":2,"text":"sense really. You could have a customer that"},"1047":{"dur":1,"text":"you're following because you're interested"},"1049":{"dur":4,"text":"in their posts. Now you can see that it says"},"1053":{"dur":2,"text":"\"2 circles\". This can be for as many circles as"},"1055":{"dur":6,"text":"you have. If we're to go back to circles here,"},"1062":{"dur":2,"text":"we can see that now we've added Weblinx,"},"1064":{"dur":3,"text":"There's 1 in the business partnerships and when"},"1067":{"dur":4,"text":"you click on the circle, it goes up here and opens."},"1071":{"dur":4,"text":"This is so you can see in this circle that there"},"1075":{"dur":1,"text":"is just one - Weblinx. From here you can edit"},"1077":{"dur":1,"text":"the circle so that's changing the name or"},"1079":{"dur":10,"text":"adding a description. I'll put \"These are our"},"1089":{"dur":6,"text":"SEO Business Partnerships.\" As you can see,"},"1096":{"dur":2,"text":"I've also took this opportunity to include the"},"1098":{"dur":2,"text":"keyword once again. it's just little things like"},"1101":{"dur":2,"text":"this, little subtleties that really help you be"},"1103":{"dur":5,"text":"successful on Google+. Next I'll save that."},"1109":{"dur":2,"text":"From this menu, you can also, after editing it,"},"1111":{"dur":2,"text":"share the circle. So if you've got a circle that"},"1114":{"dur":1,"text":"you want to share with your friends and say that"},"1116":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Look this list of people are great, add them.\""},"1119":{"dur":1,"text":"then that's how you can do it. Or if you've"},"1120":{"dur":1,"text":"fallen out with a load of people, you can just"},"1122":{"dur":4,"text":"delete the full circle and that's all of them gone."},"1127":{"dur":3,"text":"Now that's pretty much it in terms of what"},"1131":{"dur":3,"text":"you can do to your page. So let's see one that's"},"1135":{"dur":3,"text":"already been done - Weblinx. We've gone for the"},"1138":{"dur":2,"text":"team approach across the top so we've added"},"1140":{"dur":2,"text":"5 profiles of our team along this. So you've got"},"1142":{"dur":3,"text":"Craig the MD, Nadz the Director, Me an"},"1146":{"dur":2,"text":"Internet Marketing Developer, Marcus a Social"},"1149":{"dur":3,"text":"Media Strategist and Adam, our Technical manager."},"1152":{"dur":2,"text":"So we've just got them across the top, just to add"},"1155":{"dur":3,"text":"a more personal feel, if you can see some of our"},"1158":{"dur":4,"text":"posts down there. If you go to the \"About Us\","},"1162":{"dur":1,"text":"you can see that we've filled this out. We've"},"1164":{"dur":1,"text":"also added our recommended links."},"1166":{"dur":3,"text":"This is what a finished profile would look like."},"1169":{"dur":6,"text":"Now with Google+, you don't have to just have one"},"1176":{"dur":4,"text":"person in control of the profile. To give other"},"1180":{"dur":3,"text":"people admin capabilities, all you need to do is"},"1184":{"dur":2,"text":"go back to home as I've just clicked and click the"},"1186":{"dur":1,"text":"little arrow again.. Then you go down to \"Manage"},"1188":{"dur":5,"text":"Your Pages\".

So there's also a"},"1225":{"dur":3,"text":"variety of other little things you can change in"},"1229":{"dur":3,"text":"here such as when Google will notify you"},"1232":{"dur":3,"text":"basically. It's up to the individual how much"},"1236":{"dur":1,"text":"they want to be notified by Google"},"1238":{"dur":1,"text":"or it depends onhow much they check on the"},"1239":{"dur":3,"text":"account.
