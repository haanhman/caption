to be innovators."},"271":{"dur":3,"text":"But the real gap is\nwith innovation leaders."},"275":{"dur":3,"text":"Not many people know\nhow to lead innovation."},"278":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's what

decade"},"288":{"dur":3,"text":"and then kind of move on to what\nit takes to be an innovation"},"291":{"dur":3,"text":"leader in today's world, because\nI think this is something that"},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"is not well understood."},"297":{"dur":5,"text":"So let me start with\ntalking about how"},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"leadership has changed\ndramatically over the last 10"},"305":{"dur":1,"text":"years."},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, when I was\ngrowing up, leadership"},"309":{"dur":2,"text":"was very hierarchical."},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"And we had very highly\nstructured companies"},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"like AT&T and General Motors."},"316":{"dur":3,"text":"And today it's all\nabout empowerment."},"319":{"dur":3,"text":"And, to be honest, those of you\nwho are millennials or Gen Xers"},"323":{"dur":3,"text":"like my family is\naren't going to work"},"326":{"dur":1,"text":"in an hierarchical organization."},"327":{"dur":1,"text":"You don't want to be directed."},"329":{"dur":3,"text":"You want to have the freedom to\ngo out and innovate yourself."},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think that is-- why not?"},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"But why do we create these\nhierarchical structures?"},"337":{"dur":1,"text":"They made everyone comfortable."},"339":{"dur":1,"text":"Even the military's\ngone away from it."},"340":{"dur":2,"text":"So the second thing\nis bureaucracy."},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"No one wants to work in a\nbureaucratic organization."},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"How do you create a series\nof interdependent units?"},"348":{"dur":1,"text":"You're trying to do\nthat with Alphabet."},"349":{"dur":1,"text":"You've done it within Google."},"351":{"dur":1,"text":"How do you have\ninterdependent teams"},"352":{"dur":3,"text":"so you can learn from each\nother, build on each other,"},"355":{"dur":3,"text":"but have the freedom to go\noff and do your own thing?"},"358":{"dur":1,"text":"The third thing is\nwe've gone from an era"},"360":{"dur":3,"text":"of limited information\nto full transparency."},"363":{"dur":3,"text":"Obviously Google's mission is\nto support that and help that."},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"But think what\nhappened last week"},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"in the congressional testimony."},"371":{"dur":3,"text":"The CEO of Volkswagen\nUS, after having admitted"},"375":{"dur":3,"text":"that the engineers intentionally\nfalsified emissions tests"},"378":{"dur":3,"text":"in cars for 11 million\ncars, blamed it"},"382":{"dur":1,"text":"on the lowest level engineers."},"384":{"dur":0,"text":"I'm very cynical."},"385":{"dur":1,"text":"I wrote in the\narticle that's going"},"386":{"dur":1,"text":"to come out tomorrow\non this subject"},"388":{"dur":1,"text":"because we'll blame\nit on the engineers."},"390":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's forget about the\nfact that the high level"},"392":{"dur":1,"text":"executives support it."},"393":{"dur":3,"text":"And he said, no, we're not\ngoing to disclose any documents."},"397":{"dur":1,"text":"They've committed a crime."},"398":{"dur":1,"text":"That's the reality."},"399":{"dur":3,"text":"It's against the law to\nfalsify emissions tests."},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"And they're going to\nbe held to account."},"404":{"dur":2,"text":"And you know that the\ncourts and the lawyers"},"407":{"dur":1,"text":"are going to get out\nall the documents."},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"So today you have to\nbe fully transparent."},"411":{"dur":2,"text":"I always tell CEOs\nyou're a public figure."},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"Everything you say\nand think in private,"},"416":{"dur":1,"text":"it's going to be\noutside the company."},"418":{"dur":1,"text":"Everything you do\non your own time,"},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"somebody is going to take\na Facebook picture of you,"},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"or a movie of you, or\ntape record what you said."},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"It's all public, so be\ncareful what you say."},"427":{"dur":1,"text":"You just get over there,\nthat's the reality."},"429":{"dur":1,"text":"And a lot of people at\nheads of organizations"},"430":{"dur":1,"text":"are very uncomfortable."},"432":{"dur":1,"text":"But today we live in\na transparent world."},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that's a good thing."},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"I think we should have access\nto all the information."},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"In my day, it was\nall about charisma."},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"So you didn't feel\nlike yourself."},"441":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not charismatic,\nso I can't be a leader."},"443":{"dur":3,"text":"Yeah, a lot of the best leaders\nare not very charismatic."},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"Do they have to be\nlike Jack Welch?"},"449":{"dur":1,"text":"Do they have to learn\nto fake it to make it?"},"450":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't think so."},"452":{"dur":3,"text":"I think it's really all\nabout being who you are."},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"It's being authentic\nand being real."},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's what\nleadership is all about."},"461":{"dur":5,"text":"And then I think we were trained\nin an era of self interest."},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"Today's era, particularly\nwith Gen Xers and millenials"},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"has really changed."},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"I think we're in an era where\nwe're actually trying to make"},"472":{"dur":0,"text":"a difference in the world."},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"We're not just trying\nto make a lot of money."},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"You can make a lot of money\nand live a miserable life."},"477":{"dur":1,"text":"We could all do\nwell financially,"},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"but that's not the question."},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"The question is, what are\nyou going to leave behind?"},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"How are you going to\nmake a difference?"},"484":{"dur":1,"text":"And how can you work\nto serve others?"},"486":{"dur":3,"text":"Because I believe the best\nleaders are servant leaders."},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"So let me site for things\nthat have really changed."},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"The first of them\nis globalization."},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"We live in a global world."},"496":{"dur":1,"text":"Why would we fight immigration?"},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"We're a nation of immigrants."},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"All of us-- except\nif anyone in the room"},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"is a pure native American-- have\nall immigrated from somewhere."},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"Our families have\ncome from somewhere."},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"We live in a global world."},"508":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's honor that global world."},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"And the global\ndiversity that brings us"},"511":{"dur":3,"text":"makes us that much stronger."},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"The second thing, technology\nhas changed everything."},"518":{"dur":1,"text":"It's brought us\nthis transparency."},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"Its brought us\ninstant communication."},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"It's brought us instant\naccess to what's going on."},"525":{"dur":1,"text":"You can't just read\nthe newspaper anymore,"},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"you have to be on\nGoogle News to find out"},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"what happened in the last hour."},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"Third, I think the millennials\nhave changed everything"},"534":{"dur":4,"text":"because they are going to\nnot just ask for, but seek"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"out and demand\nopportunities to make"},"540":{"dur":1,"text":"a difference at a young age."},"541":{"dur":3,"text":"I had my first general\nmanagement position at age 27."},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"Someone gave me an opportunity."},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"It was my first leadership role."},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"But, I tell you, it was\nthe best learning I had."},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"I made a lot of mistakes, but\nit was the best learning I ever"},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"had having that kind of role."},"554":{"dur":3,"text":"And then finally back to the\nwhole immigration question."},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"We should honor diversity."},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"See, I don't believe in quotas."},"562":{"dur":1,"text":"I never have believed in quotas."},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"What I think you should bring\nis people with diverse life"},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"experiences around the table."},"567":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't care what their gender,\ntheir race, their religion,"},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"their sexual preference,\nnational origin."},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"That's not what matters."},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"It's getting diverse\npeople around the table,"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"and I think you're going\nto make better decisions"},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"and you're going to\nlearn a lot more."},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're just with people of\nyour own tribe, so to speak,"},"584":{"dur":3,"text":"you won't really learn about how\nthe rest of the world operates."},"588":{"dur":0,"text":"OK?"},"589":{"dur":3,"text":"So let me just compare the\nold world we grew up in"},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"and how it has changed\ntoday in what I call"},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"the authentic leader's view."},"597":{"dur":3,"text":"And, unfortunately, we\nhaven't overcome our tendency"},"600":{"dur":1,"text":"to maximize short term value."},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact, one of the clever\nthings about the Google two"},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"class voting structure gives\nyou some freedom from that."},"607":{"dur":3,"text":"But I worked a lot with DuPont,\nand last week Ellen Kullman"},"610":{"dur":3,"text":"resigned, was fired,\ndraw your own conclusion,"},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"but it's a real sad\nthing because she"},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"was doing, in my opinion,\na terrific job for DuPont."},"620":{"dur":1,"text":"But it is such a\nshort term world."},"621":{"dur":1,"text":"She had a bad quarter."},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"I can tell you as a leader,\nyou can have a bad quarter."},"625":{"dur":1,"text":"You will of a bad quarter."},"626":{"dur":1,"text":"You'll miss your budget."},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"The numbers won't go your way."},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're generating revenues,\nthey won't always hit."},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"There's no such thing as\nup, up, and straight up."},"634":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not like you're\non a rocket ship"},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"to the moon with no deviations."},"637":{"dur":1,"text":"You're going to hit bad times."},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"Things are not going\nto go your way."},"640":{"dur":1,"text":"And, frankly,\nthat's a real test."},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think you've got to\nbuild for the long term."},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"How do you sustain success?"},"645":{"dur":3,"text":"Achieve short term results,\nbut sustain success"},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"for the long term."},"651":{"dur":1,"text":"I think we've lived\nin a world which"},"653":{"dur":1,"text":"is very shareholder focused."},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think it's really\nall about the customers."},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"One of the people\nI really admire--"},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"and I focus in the book--\nis Narayana Murthy,"},"662":{"dur":3,"text":"the CEO of Infosys, and he\nsaid something very perceptive."},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"He said, unless you\ncreate sustainable value"},"668":{"dur":3,"text":"for your customers, you cannot\ncreate sustainable value"},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"for your shareholders."},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"In other words, unless you're\nproviding value to the people"},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"you serve-- Medtronic at\nproviding genuine value"},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"from its products,\nits defibrillators,"},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"its spinal products,\nits diabetes products--"},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"unless it's better than\nany of the competitors,"},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"Medtronics is going\nto go out of business."},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"That's what happened\nto General Motors."},"688":{"dur":3,"text":"They lost 65% of\ntheir US market share."},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"And they wound up in bankruptcy."},"695":{"dur":3,"text":"The reason was not because\nof any exogenous factors."},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"It was all because\nthey had failed"},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"to meet their customer's\nneeds and no one"},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"drove their automobiles anymore."},"704":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think it's all about how\ndo you provide sustainable"},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"value to your customers."},"709":{"dur":4,"text":"Third, most companies have\nbeen driven as multinationals."},"713":{"dur":3,"text":"You have a strong center and you\nbranch out to the other areas."},"717":{"dur":4,"text":"Today we're learning what we\ncan learn so much by engagement"},"721":{"dur":0,"text":"of the markets."},"722":{"dur":1,"text":"We let that come back here."},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"And what people really\nwant is very different."},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"Unilever, a great\nconsumer products company,"},"728":{"dur":3,"text":"has got 65% of its business\ncomes from emerging markets."},"731":{"dur":4,"text":"Not from non-US, but\nfrom emerging markets."},"736":{"dur":3,"text":"And they have a formula where\nthey go in and really learn"},"739":{"dur":0,"text":"about the markets."},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"So the soups people\nwant in Vietnam"},"742":{"dur":3,"text":"are different than the\nsoups people want in China."},"745":{"dur":1,"text":"Sometimes they come\nup with great products"},"747":{"dur":1,"text":"that are a result of that."},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"And then they leverage\ntheir corporate strengths"},"751":{"dur":1,"text":"against those needs."},"753":{"dur":1,"text":"But it all starts\nwith understanding"},"754":{"dur":1,"text":"what are people's needs."},"756":{"dur":1,"text":"And I know you face\nsome difficulties"},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"in certain countries like China."},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"We'll find a way eventually\nI think through that."},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"It's too important of a country."},"765":{"dur":1,"text":"And there are ways around that."},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"But there are differences\nin laws and regulations."},"769":{"dur":2,"text":"And so got to find\nour way through that."},"771":{"dur":1,"text":"Leadership is no longer\njust from the top."},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think this company\nillustrates that very well."},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"We need leaders at all levels\nand we need ideas bubbling up."},"779":{"dur":3,"text":"I've found and I\ntell leaders today"},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"find out who the informal\nleaders in your organization"},"785":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe they have\nno direct reports."},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe they're an

them."},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"Let them guide you."},"796":{"dur":1,"text":"If you do that, your\ncompany is going"},"798":{"dur":2,"text":"to be much more successful."},"801":{"dur":1,"text":"So you need leaders\nat all levels."},"803":{"dur":2,"text":"We were just working on a\nvideo for future leaders."},"806":{"dur":1,"text":"It's hard to develop leaders."},"807":{"dur":1,"text":"It's hard to

need to do\nthat, otherwise you'll"},"815":{"dur":1,"text":"get very stale."},"817":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think today you\nneed to really flatten"},"819":{"dur":3,"text":"your organization\nat the
