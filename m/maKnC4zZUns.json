was no plan."},"2115":{"dur":4,"text":"So I said to them, here's what I think happens."},"2119":{"dur":5,"text":"I think what happens is that when some report\ncomes out, or when some extreme weather

such a serious problem after all."},"2141":{"dur":1,"text":"That was my reading."},"2143":{"dur":1,"text":"And so we put our plan together."},"2144":{"dur":1,"text":"And our plan has five parts."},"2145":{"dur":3,"text":"The first is there's got to be a reliable\nprice on carbon."},"2149":{"dur":1,"text":"And I don't know how we're going to do it."},"2151":{"dur":3,"text":"It's going to be really hard, but we've got\nto find a way to put a price on carbon."},"2154":{"dur":2,"text":"The second is we've got to remove fuel subsidies."},"2157":{"dur":2,"text":"Egypt is facing many, many different problems."},"2160":{"dur":6,"text":"One of the biggest ones is they spend 8 percent\n-- 8 percent of GDP goes for subsidies of"},"2166":{"dur":1,"text":"all sorts."},"2168":{"dur":6,"text":"They've got to remove fuel subsidies because\nit's both bad for the -- bad for the air and"},"2175":{"dur":1,"text":"also very bad for governments."},"2177":{"dur":1,"text":"This is a huge expense."},"2178":{"dur":2,"text":"It's just very politically unpopular to remove\nthem."},"2181":{"dur":3,"text":"We want to work with countries to remove fuel\nsubsidies."},"2184":{"dur":3,"text":"And the other three -- one is cleaner cities."},"2187":{"dur":4,"text":"That's why we worked with China on this urbanization\nreport, because we think that there are -- there"},"2191":{"dur":5,"text":"are tremendous innovations in building cleaner\ncities that are just not being used."},"2197":{"dur":2,"text":"Cities are being built on the basis of sprawl."},"2199":{"dur":5,"text":"And the lack of planning is causing carbon\noutput to go up."},"2205":{"dur":5,"text":"And we now know that there are fantastic examples\nof being able to reduce carbon output from"},"2210":{"dur":1,"text":"cities -- New York, for example."},"2211":{"dur":1,"text":"This is an amazing example."},"2213":{"dur":4,"text":"Mike Bloomberg said we're going to reduce\nour carbon footprint by 30 percent by 2030."},"2217":{"dur":3,"text":"They're going to get the job done by 2017."},"2220":{"dur":1,"text":"So the examples are out there."},"2222":{"dur":3,"text":"We have to be the organization that takes\nthe great solutions that are already out there"},"2226":{"dur":2,"text":"and spreads them around the world."},"2228":{"dur":4,"text":"Another is access to finance for sustainable\nenergy."},"2233":{"dur":5,"text":"We do not yet have the kind of access to finance\nfor sustainable energy sources that people"},"2238":{"dur":1,"text":"need."},"2239":{"dur":9,"text":"There's not enough financing to meet the demand\nfor solar and wind -- wind energy, for example,"},"2248":{"dur":1,"text":"in Africa."},"2249":{"dur":1,"text":"We need to do that."},"2250":{"dur":3,"text":"And finally, there's this thing that we call\nclimate-smart agriculture."},"2253":{"dur":7,"text":"There are so many great examples of how individual\ncountries, individual states, individual farmers,"},"2260":{"dur":7,"text":"even, have brought to the table really innovative\nways of not only increasing productivity,"},"2268":{"dur":1,"text":"but actually putting carbon back into the\nground."},"2270":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, I just had a great conversation with\nBill Gates about this issue."},"2274":{"dur":4,"text":"And he -- he's very interested, of course,\nin agriculture and health."},"2278":{"dur":4,"text":"And he points out that everything you need\nto do to increase the productivity of small"},"2283":{"dur":6,"text":"holder farmers in Africa, for example, is\nexactly the same thing that you need to do"},"2289":{"dur":2,"text":"to create more climate-smart agriculture."},"2291":{"dur":4,"text":"So it -- so there are at least these five\nthings that we know we could do right now."},"2296":{"dur":2,"text":"These are all win-win propositions."},"2298":{"dur":4,"text":"These are things that -- that -- that I think\nthere is general agreement on."},"2302":{"dur":2,"text":"I think the most controversial one is the\nprice on carbon."},"2305":{"dur":3,"text":"But the other four, boy, I think we generally\nagree on this."},"2309":{"dur":6,"text":"If we could just make those four or five things\nhappen, it's in my view the beginning of a"},"2315":{"dur":1,"text":"plan."},"2316":{"dur":5,"text":"But the basic point is this, why are we not\nas serious about climate change as we were"},"2322":{"dur":1,"text":"about HIV?"},"2323":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, part of it is we had Harold and others\nwho led -- who led the charge."},"2327":{"dur":6,"text":"But another part of it is I just -- I think\nwe're not yet alive to the science of what"},"2334":{"dur":1,"text":"the IPCC's telling us."},"2335":{"dur":4,"text":"CARUSO-CABRERA: As you know there are, there's\ncriticisms, though, of -- a lot of people"},"2339":{"dur":2,"text":"would say mission creep (ph) by the World\nBank."},"2341":{"dur":5,"text":"If your mission is to alleviate poverty, and\nthen you're focused on climate change, as"},"2346":{"dur":4,"text":"we discussed before, sometimes there's a choice\nmade between the two, right?"},"2351":{"dur":1,"text":"Ultimately do you lean towards for the first?"},"2352":{"dur":1,"text":"KIM: Sure."},"2353":{"dur":5,"text":"Whether we're -- as we look at the potential\nimpacts of climate change, for example, one"},"2359":{"dur":3,"text":"of our -- our biggest clients is Bangladesh,\nright."},"2362":{"dur":5,"text":"Bangladesh, if you look at what's happening\nwith even a small rise in the oceans and look"},"2368":{"dur":3,"text":"at how much land they're going to lose, this\nis going to be the number-one poverty issue"},"2371":{"dur":1,"text":"for them."},"2372":{"dur":7,"text":"If you look at the coastal city, the -- one\nof the predictions is that if we get to where"},"2379":{"dur":3,"text":"we think we're going to get in terms of temperature\nrise and sea rise, Bangkok could be underwater"},"2383":{"dur":1,"text":"by 2030."},"2384":{"dur":4,"text":"So we feel that tackling climate change is\ncritical to tackling extreme poverty."},"2389":{"dur":2,"text":"CARUSO-CABRERA: But is the World Bank the\nbest mechanism?"},"2392":{"dur":5,"text":"KIM: Well, when I came on board, I was hoping\nthat they would say, hey, here's the plan."},"2397":{"dur":2,"text":"We have a plan and we want you to do this\npart of it."},"2400":{"dur":1,"text":"That would have been great."},"2401":{"dur":3,"text":"We would have gone off and said, OK, great,\nI'm glad you have a plan."},"2404":{"dur":1,"text":"We'll do our part."},"2405":{"dur":1,"text":"CARUSO-CABRERA: But you agree?"},"2406":{"dur":3,"text":"You think the World Bank can execute on that\nmission in a leadership way?"},"2409":{"dur":4,"text":"KIM: Well, we -- we can -- we can scale-up\nclimate-smart agriculture."},"2414":{"dur":2,"text":"We can provide better financing for renewable\nenergy."},"2417":{"dur":1,"text":"We definitely can help people build cleaner\ncities."},"2418":{"dur":3,"text":"CARUSO-CABRERA: Even though the reason solar\nand wind don't get a lot of investment is"},"2421":{"dur":3,"text":"because it's not profitable in a lot of places?"},"2425":{"dur":5,"text":"KIM: Well, you know, the -- the -- the profitability\nis one aspect of it."},"2430":{"dur":3,"text":"But the real problem is in our understanding\nthat you need long-term financing and it's"},"2434":{"dur":5,"text":"just very difficult to find long-term financing\nanywhere in -- in the developing world."},"2440":{"dur":6,"text":"And the -- the real issue, and the reason\nwhy so many developing country leaders are"},"2446":{"dur":4,"text":"so worried is that even at times of very low\ninterest rates, it was still hard to find"},"2450":{"dur":3,"text":"long-term financing for things like infrastructure,\nfor energy."},"2453":{"dur":2,"text":"And now with interest rates going up, the\nquestion is..."},"2456":{"dur":1,"text":"CARUSO-CABRERA: It's going to be harder."},"2457":{"dur":1,"text":"KIM: ... Will it get even harder?"},"2458":{"dur":1,"text":"And so that's our role."},"2459":{"dur":1,"text":"We always play a countercyclical role."},"2461":{"dur":4,"text":"And so in this particular case, it's making\nfinancing available for those things that"},"2466":{"dur":2,"text":"we know are both good for people and good\nfor the environment."},"2468":{"dur":1,"text":"CARUSO-CABRERA: All right."},"2469":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's go to the back."},"2470":{"dur":3,"text":"The woman in the very back row?"},"2473":{"dur":3,"text":"In the purple."},"2476":{"dur":2,"text":"QUESTION: Thank

fully."},"2530":{"dur":8,"text":"So one of the most important studies that\nhave ever been done in the world of health"},"2538":{"dur":2,"text":"and especially global health just came out\nrecently."},"2541":{"dur":8,"text":"Larry Summers and Dean Jamison did a review\nof -- of 20 years of investing in health."},"2549":{"dur":4,"text":"And they were responsible for the 1993

stunning."},"2566":{"dur":9,"text":"One was that from 2000 to 2011, during that\nperiod, they estimated that 24 percent of"},"2576":{"dur":4,"text":"economic growth in that period was related\nto improved health."},"2580":{"dur":7,"text":"And so, they made the case that now it's not\njust a question of investing in health because"},"2588":{"dur":3,"text":"it's the right thing to do morally or ethically."},"2591":{"dur":3,"text":"Investing in health is the right thing to\ndo economically."},"2594":{"dur":3,"text":"And we've never had that kind of number in\nthe world before."},"2597":{"dur":4,"text":"This was -- it was a stunning number."},"2601":{"dur":2,"text":"In education, just to give you another example."},"2604":{"dur":4,"text":"The OECD puts out something

does."},"2620":{"dur":4,"text":"So now we have direct evidence that investing\nin education and investing in health is actually"},"2624":{"dur":1,"text":"good for economic growth."},"2626":{"dur":3,"text":"We really didn't have those kinds of numbers\n20 years ago."},"2629":{"dur":4,"text":"And people like me who are health activists\nwere sort of using a moral, ethical argument"},"2633":{"dur":1,"text":"to invest in health and education."},"2635":{"dur":2,"text":"But now we've got the economic argument."},"2637":{"dur":1,"text":"You need to invest in your people."},"2639":{"dur":6,"text":"In that study, one of the clearest no-brainers\nis stopping tobacco use or slowing down tobacco"},"2645":{"dur":1,"text":"use."},"2646":{"dur":3,"text":"And so it's something that we simply have\nto look at."},"2649":{"dur":8,"text":"And what we're now trying to look at is how\ncan we provide everyone some sort of security"},"2657":{"dur":1,"text":"in healthcare?"},"2658":{"dur":2,"text":"Universal health coverage is the language\nthat we're using."},"2661":{"dur":1,"text":"And so we're very involved in that."},"2662":{"dur":2,"text":"We've become
