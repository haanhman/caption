2010,"},"15":{"dur":2,"text":"and she wore this strange\nthing on her arm,"},"17":{"dur":1,"text":"this shiny thing."},"18":{"dur":2,"text":"She didn't know the technology behind it"},"20":{"dur":1,"text":"but her friends were jealous"},"21":{"dur":2,"text":"and they all asked\nwhere they could buy one."},"23":{"dur":2,"text":"Her response was, \"You can't.\""},"26":{"dur":2,"text":"Because it was 3D-printed just for her."},"28":{"dur":2,"text":"It's the only one of its kind."},"31":{"dur":1,"text":"So they asked the next best thing,"},"32":{"dur":1,"text":"which was, \"Can we try it on?\""},"34":{"dur":1,"text":"And she said, \n\"No, no, no."},"35":{"dur":1,"text":"You can't do that either.\""},"37":{"dur":3,"text":"Because it was created\nusing a 3D-scan of her arm,"},"40":{"dur":2,"text":"so even though it fit her perfectly"},"42":{"dur":2,"text":"it wouldn't fit anyone else at all."},"45":{"dur":3,"text":"Besides, the designer and the doctor\nwho made it for her"},"48":{"dur":2,"text":"told her to not take it off for 4 weeks."},"50":{"dur":2,"text":"Because, see, she had fallen off the swing"},"52":{"dur":2,"text":"the week before \nand broken her arm severely"},"54":{"dur":2,"text":"and this was the cast\nthat was helping her to heal."},"57":{"dur":1,"text":"But what's more remarkable"},"59":{"dur":1,"text":"is that when she was finished,"},"61":{"dur":2,"text":"when she was healed, 4 weeks later,"},"63":{"dur":2,"text":"she didn't want to give the cast back."},"65":{"dur":0,"text":"(Laughter)"},"66":{"dur":1,"text":"See, by then it had become jewelry,"},"68":{"dur":2,"text":"it had become fashion to her, \nshe loved it."},"71":{"dur":2,"text":"The strange thing,\nthis is what surprised us,"},"73":{"dur":2,"text":"she actually tanned \nher name into her arm."},"76":{"dur":2,"text":"So in that day a strange thing happened,"},"79":{"dur":2,"text":"because the line between design"},"81":{"dur":1,"text":"and technology and fashion,"},"83":{"dur":2,"text":"3 somewhat unrelated fields,"},"85":{"dur":1,"text":"was somehow blurred."},"87":{"dur":1,"text":"They all became one."},"89":{"dur":2,"text":"And in a sense we ask,\nwhy shouldn't they be?"},"91":{"dur":3,"text":"Why shouldn't this be the way\nit is for all medical devices?"},"94":{"dur":2,"text":"Because when we think of medical products,"},"96":{"dur":2,"text":"we think of things that are brutal,"},"98":{"dur":4,"text":"things that are utilitarian and functional\nbut to an extreme."},"103":{"dur":1,"text":"We think of the problem,"},"104":{"dur":2,"text":"we don't think of the person."},"107":{"dur":1,"text":"We never think of beauty,"},"108":{"dur":1,"text":"because the idea of beauty"},"110":{"dur":2,"text":"would undermine \nthe credibility of the medicine."},"112":{"dur":1,"text":"Because we have it in our heads that,"},"114":{"dur":1,"text":"if medicine doesn't taste bad,"},"115":{"dur":1,"text":"then it can't possibly work."},"117":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"118":{"dur":2,"text":"And so perhaps that leads\nto an antagonistic relationship"},"120":{"dur":2,"text":"between the products\nthat are here for our benefit"},"123":{"dur":2,"text":"and the people\nthat they are there to serve."},"125":{"dur":1,"text":"But what if we shook things up a bit?"},"127":{"dur":1,"text":"What if we changed this all?"},"128":{"dur":2,"text":"And said, instead of thinking \nof design as design,"},"131":{"dur":1,"text":"and medicine as medicine,"},"132":{"dur":2,"text":"what if we thought of design as medicine?"},"135":{"dur":1,"text":"What would that do?"},"136":{"dur":2,"text":"What would happen if these were,\ninstead of antagonist,"},"139":{"dur":2,"text":"if these were collaborative fields?"},"141":{"dur":1,"text":"What might that bring?"},"142":{"dur":1,"text":"Because, in a sense, they both offer"},"144":{"dur":1,"text":"something the other can't."},"146":{"dur":2,"text":"They amplify each other."},"148":{"dur":1,"text":"What would it take for us"},"149":{"dur":2,"text":"to fall in love with those products\nthat are here to serve us?"},"152":{"dur":2,"text":"Because, after all, these products\nare here for us alone."},"155":{"dur":1,"text":"And then, to throw into the mix,"},"157":{"dur":1,"text":"we have the new technologies."},"158":{"dur":2,"text":"Specifically, 3D-scanning and 3D-printing."},"160":{"dur":2,"text":"Technologies that are \nso versatile and so enabling"},"163":{"dur":1,"text":"that they not only change"},"165":{"dur":2,"text":"the way we create products,"},"167":{"dur":1,"text":"they change the way we think"},"168":{"dur":2,"text":"about creating problem-solving products."},"171":{"dur":3,"text":"The way we actually address\nsome of the challenges that we face."},"174":{"dur":2,"text":"Sometimes it's the revolution \nin the technology"},"177":{"dur":2,"text":"that leads to the change of thinking."},"180":{"dur":2,"text":"When you combine design and medicine,"},"183":{"dur":1,"text":"you open the doors for new opportunities"},"185":{"dur":2,"text":"for human care and quality of life."},"187":{"dur":2,"text":"These girls, for example, had broken legs."},"190":{"dur":3,"text":"But they live at the beach,\nthey spend their time in the sand."},"193":{"dur":2,"text":"So the casts that were created \nfor their legs"},"195":{"dur":3,"text":"were 3D-scanned from their bodies\nand 3D-printed."},"198":{"dur":1,"text":"So they could go to the beach,"},"200":{"dur":2,"text":"they could play in the sands,\nthey could play in the water,"},"202":{"dur":2,"text":"and when they get home,\nthe patterning in the braces"},"205":{"dur":2,"text":"not only ventilated them\nand kept them comfortable,"},"208":{"dur":2,"text":"but it let the sand go away,"},"210":{"dur":2,"text":"and let them sleep in it\nand be comfortable in their braces."},"213":{"dur":2,"text":"And perhaps as significantly,\nwhen they were healed,"},"215":{"dur":2,"text":"the braces came off simply\nby opening the hinge,"},"218":{"dur":2,"text":"not with the buzz-saw \nthat terrifies children."},"222":{"dur":2,"text":"When you look at scoliosis treatment,"},"224":{"dur":3,"text":"traditional medical treatment\nmeans the child wears a brace"},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"that forces the spine \ninto the correct orientation."},"230":{"dur":3,"text":"And this works great,\nprovided that the patient"},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"wears the brace extensively\nfor several years."},"237":{"dur":3,"text":"In other words, if the patient\nsimply does not like the brace,"},"240":{"dur":1,"text":"she won't wear the brace"},"242":{"dur":2,"text":"and if she doesn't wear the brace\nshe won't be healed"},"244":{"dur":1,"text":"and all the medicine is for nothing."},"246":{"dur":2,"text":"So in a sense you could say\nthat the medical role"},"249":{"dur":2,"text":"is to make the patient like the brace."},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"So, instead, if we design a fashion item"},"254":{"dur":2,"text":"that happens to serve a medical purpose,"},"257":{"dur":2,"text":"we can open up a new opportunity,"},"259":{"dur":2,"text":"we can re-phrase the experience"},"261":{"dur":3,"text":"and open up a new look\nat the medical quality of her care."},"266":{"dur":3,"text":"This brace was created \nwith a 3D-scan of her body,"},"269":{"dur":3,"text":"digitally corrected, and then 3D-printed."},"272":{"dur":2,"text":"So it wasn't as much made for her"},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"as it was made from her."},"278":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a perfect fit to her body,\nso it's invisible under clothing,"},"281":{"dur":1,"text":"but when you look at the pattern,"},"283":{"dur":1,"text":"the pattern is what really adds"},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"the design, the medicine, \nand the magic to it."},"287":{"dur":3,"text":"Because the pattern not only\nmakes the brace lighter,"},"291":{"dur":1,"text":"because it's less material,"},"293":{"dur":2,"text":"and it makes it less expensive,\nwhich is important,"},"296":{"dur":3,"text":"because in 3D-printing\nyou pay by the material."},"299":{"dur":2,"text":"It also makes your skin breathe,\nso she's more comfortable."},"301":{"dur":1,"text":"But, most importantly of all,"},"303":{"dur":2,"text":"she gets to choose the pattern."},"306":{"dur":1,"text":"That we give her agency in the process."},"308":{"dur":2,"text":"We invite her into the process,\nlet her be the co-designer"},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"of the product that is going to be\na big part of her life"},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"in the next couple of years."},"314":{"dur":3,"text":"By her engaging in the product's creation"},"318":{"dur":1,"text":"that is for her body,"},"319":{"dur":1,"text":"she will then like it more."},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"And if she likes it more,\nshe wears it more."},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"If she wears it more,\nshe will be fixed."},"326":{"dur":3,"text":"And so in this case, the best design\nis the best medicine."},"331":{"dur":1,"text":"Or we look at prosthetic limbs."},"333":{"dur":2,"text":"They can do amazing things for the body"},"335":{"dur":1,"text":"as far as restoring our ability"},"336":{"dur":3,"text":"to walk and run and perform\nregular activities."},"340":{"dur":2,"text":"But what they don't do is they don't look"},"342":{"dur":1,"text":"at those components of being human"},"344":{"dur":3,"text":"that go beyond the mechanical \naspects of walking."},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"They don't look at our individuality,"},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"our uniqueness, \nour personality, our style."},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"They leave it at our ability to walk."},"353":{"dur":2,"text":"But what if instead, we went beyond that"},"356":{"dur":4,"text":"and tried to treat the product\nas a vehicle for art and design?"},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"What if we treated it as a thing\nof fashion and beauty,"},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"if we tried to elevate it\ninto the world of art,"},"365":{"dur":1,"text":"beyond the world of machine?"},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"What if we re-phrased the story"},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"and took something that \nhad been a source of discomfort"},"373":{"dur":3,"text":"and turned it into an opportunity \nfor social engagement?"},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"Because we can 3D-scan and 3D-print,"},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"we can create something \nunimaginable otherwise,"},"381":{"dur":2,"text":"we can recreate symmetry and body form"},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"and uniqueness in the body."},"386":{"dur":3,"text":"We can take something that\nwould have been mechanical and utilitarian"},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"and turn it into something expressive."},"392":{"dur":1,"text":"We can let the person turn their body"},"394":{"dur":1,"text":"into their art and their sculpture,"},"396":{"dur":3,"text":"which is what it really is, \nafter all, isn't it?"},"399":{"dur":1,"text":"We can take the attention away"},"400":{"dur":1,"text":"from the machinery and the hardware"},"402":{"dur":1,"text":"and turn it back to the person"},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"and their fashion, their style,\ntheir individuality."},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"We can re-engage the person with society"},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"and change the way they see their self,"},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"see their body, see themself in the way"},"414":{"dur":1,"text":"society interacts with them."},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's really not art or medicine."},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"It's art and medicine."},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"Amanda, here, broke her spine"},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"in a ski accident several years ago"},"427":{"dur":4,"text":"and, although she can't walk\nwithout the assistance of this robot,"},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"now she's able to engage \nwith people eye to eye."},"434":{"dur":1,"text":"She's able to walk."},"435":{"dur":1,"text":"She's able to interact."},"437":{"dur":3,"text":"Because the robot now \nthat she wears lets her walk."},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"But now what is, in our mind's eye,"},"442":{"dur":3,"text":"something equally exciting, \nis where this goes next."},"446":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe at this we'll reach a point"},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"where it's not a robot that she straps on,"},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"but it will be more like\nfashion that she wears."},"452":{"dur":3,"text":"That would be the truly\nrevolutionary difference."},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"When we can 3D-scan her body"},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"and turn her into part\nof the design process,"},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"she becomes the first\ningredient in the process."},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"It re-writes the way we design a product."},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"Instead of making her the last ingredient\nin the equation,"},"470":{"dur":3,"text":"we make her the first ingredient\nin the equation."},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"And suddenly, as we're printing the parts,"},"475":{"dur":3,"text":"we're able to create parts\nthat are directly aimed at the intent,"},"479":{"dur":3,"text":"rather than the intent as limited\nby the means of production."},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"And we can start creating a product now"},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"that uses her own body as its canvas,"},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"as its underlay, as its reference model."},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"All of a sudden, the parts become\ninterstitial components"},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"that connect her body to the robot,"},"497":{"dur":4,"text":"into one single symbiotic kinematic form."},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"The parts can be designed\nin such a way that"},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"\u2013 in this case they're patterned \u2013"},"505":{"dur":1,"text":"not only does that make it stronger"},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"and more flexible and lighter,"},"509":{"dur":1,"text":"but also there's a visual metaphor"},"510":{"dur":3,"text":"for the musculature that this replaces."},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"And of course with 3D-printed\nsterling silver jewellery,"},"517":{"dur":3,"text":"because we decided\nthat this robot needed jewellery."},"520":{"dur":3,"text":"So the final form is as much\nan expression of her body"},"523":{"dur":3,"text":"as it is an extension of her personality\nand her sense of style."},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"Amanda took her very first steps"},"529":{"dur":3,"text":"in this robot about 6 months ago,"},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"not far from here."},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"And it served to remind us that"},"537":{"dur":3,"text":"(Applause)"},"541":{"dur":5,"text":"the ability to go from atoms\ninto bits and back into atoms"},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"creates opportunities to address\nneeds of the human"},"549":{"dur":3,"text":"and quality of life issues that really\ncan't be done in any other way."},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"(Applause)"},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a reminder also that every one of us"},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"is, was, or will be disabled."},"565":{"dur":4,"text":"So the value of the marriage \nbetween design and medicine,"},"570":{"dur":1,"text":"as enabled by technology,"},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"is really something \nthat's here for all of us."},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you."},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"(Applause)"}}
