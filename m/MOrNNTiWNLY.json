do either"},"500":{"dur":3,"text":"by having a mouthful-- and cork\ntaint should be perceptible"},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"just on the nose, as we say."},"507":{"dur":4,"text":"But if you have a mouthful,\nor feel the glass,"},"511":{"dur":3,"text":"you can check whether the\nwine's at the right temperature,"},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"because wine is amazingly\nsensitive to
