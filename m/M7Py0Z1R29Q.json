this, in talking about\ndecision-making--"},"364":{"dur":6,"text":"that Blair and the Labour\ngovernment made a big bet."},"371":{"dur":3,"text":"They actually invested very\nheavily in the NHS, and they"},"374":{"dur":3,"text":"made it one of the cornerstone\nissues for their government"},"378":{"dur":2,"text":"and their government's\nsuccess."},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"So it was a really significant\nmoment."},"383":{"dur":3,"text":"And my very simple picture of it\nis I think between 2000 and"},"387":{"dur":1,"text":"about 2009, we saved the NHS."},"388":{"dur":1,"text":"We got it back on track."},"390":{"dur":1,"text":"But it's not sustainable."},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"The second half is\nstill to come."},"394":{"dur":3,"text":"And the second half of what\nthe NHS needs to do,"},"398":{"dur":3,"text":"unfortunately, the current\ngovernment isn't doing."},"401":{"dur":3,"text":"But what it needs to do is\nto make that shift from a"},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"hospital- and doctor-based\nservice to a community- and"},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"people-based service, in\nresponse to the change in"},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"epidemiology, which everyone\nin this room knows"},"412":{"dur":0,"text":"better than I do."},"413":{"dur":3,"text":"It needs another big shift,\nand that's yet to come."},"416":{"dur":1,"text":"That's the next installment."},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"Let me talk a bit about\nleadership and decision-making"},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"and sort of unpack\nsome of that."},"422":{"dur":3,"text":"Because I think that's the\ntheme of your event here."},"426":{"dur":1,"text":"First thing I wanted to\nsay, in talking about"},"428":{"dur":1,"text":"decision-making, of course when\nyou're the leader, of"},"430":{"dur":1,"text":"course decision-making\nis important."},"431":{"dur":1,"text":"But actually, you need\nto get other"},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"people to make decisions."},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"And I have seen many people\nfailing because they drew all"},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"the decisions up to the top."},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"And actually, if you think\nabout it, when you're"},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"operating at this level and you\nget promoted up to this"},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"level, people still ask you to\nmake the decisions you were"},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"making at the level one down."},"450":{"dur":1,"text":"And you're comfortable doing\nit, because it's in your"},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"comfort zone."},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"But actually, when you're up\nat the next level up, you"},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"should be doing only the stuff\nthat you need to be doing."},"458":{"dur":5,"text":"And therefore, it's quite clear\nthat for leaders, and"},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"particularly very big\norganizations, I actually"},"465":{"dur":3,"text":"don't actually make terribly\nmany decisions."},"468":{"dur":3,"text":"My job as leader was to make\nsure we set a direction, was"},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"to appoint the right people and\ngive them space to carry"},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"on, and then, of course,\nto challenge them."},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"But you know, you may be the\nleader, but you're not the"},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"brightest person in\nthe organization."},"480":{"dur":1,"text":"You certainly don't know\neverything else"},"482":{"dur":0,"text":"that's going on."},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you're running the Health\nService, what do I know"},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"about mental health?"},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"And actually, I need people\nto be thinking and"},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"making those decisions."},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"And I need a method of making\nsure that I'm confident that"},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"those are as good a decisions\nas being made."},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"So decision-making is quite an\ninteresting art, when you're"},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"at that senior level."},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"Let me give you two examples\nfrom my time as a chief"},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"executive of a hospital, and\nthen let me move into the"},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"Does that seem like\na fair way to go?"},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"When I was chief executive, I\nwas chief executive of the"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"Oxford Radcliffe Hospital, which\nis the John Radcliffe"},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"and the Churchill, if people\nwill know of it."},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"JENNIFER LEANING: It's\na very, very famous"},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"and esteemed hospital."},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"One of the best."},"524":{"dur":1,"text":"LORD NIGEL CRISP: I always think\nOxford and Harvard, I"},"525":{"dur":3,"text":"think, think of themselves\nas--"},"528":{"dur":3,"text":"I used to joke with my friends\nthere that they thought of"},"531":{"dur":1,"text":"themselves as a center\nof excellence."},"533":{"dur":1,"text":"But of course, there were really\na center of arrogance."},"535":{"dur":1,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"LORD NIGEL CRISP: You may\nrecognize some of that."},"539":{"dur":1,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"540":{"dur":0,"text":"JENNIFER

have."},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"I had a trauma surgeon come to\nme, and he said, Nigel, I want"},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"to change our trauma service."},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"I know the evidence."},"562":{"dur":4,"text":"The evidence is that at the\nmoment in the NHS, the sickest"},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"people are seen by the\nmost junior staff."},"569":{"dur":1,"text":"You turn up at the middle of the\nnight, and you're seen by"},"571":{"dur":3,"text":"junior, and you won't see the\nconsultant or the attending"},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"till the middle of the\nnext morning or"},"575":{"dur":0,"text":"something of that sort."},"576":{"dur":1,"text":"We've got to change it."},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"We want to change it so that\nwe've got the consultant there"},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"24 hours a day."},"582":{"dur":1,"text":"Live in the hospital, awake."},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"First person you see\nis a consultant, if"},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"you're a trauma patient."},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"I said, OK, Keith."},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"And he came to me with\nthis whole plan."},"591":{"dur":1,"text":"And my decision was\nto back him."},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"Was to actually test him out and\nto back him, and then to"},"596":{"dur":3,"text":"give him air cover, if\nthat makes sense."},"599":{"dur":1,"text":"Because actually, the\nother doctors in the"},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"hospital hated it."},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"The trauma surgeons wanted to\ndo this, but all the other"},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"doctors said, so, is this the\nthin end of the wedge?"},"607":{"dur":4,"text":"Are you going to make us be in\nthe hospital 24 hours a day?"},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"Also had some really interesting\nknock-on effects."},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"Because the agreement was that\nthey were in hospital for 24"},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"hours, and then they weren't\nallowed back in the hospital"},"617":{"dur":1,"text":"for the next 24 hours,\nbecause they'd be"},"619":{"dur":1,"text":"dangerous, wouldn't they?"},"620":{"dur":1,"text":"Or potentially so."},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"And the consequence of that, of\ncourse, is that continuity"},"625":{"dur":1,"text":"of care passed to the nurses."},"627":{"dur":3,"text":"So the only people who could\ndischarge from the trauma"},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"wards in the JR were nurses."},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"Again, powers that be\ndidn't like that."},"635":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can imagine, the sort of\ndecision-making role for me"},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"was backing that and actually\nseeing where the fight was"},"640":{"dur":1,"text":"going to come from."},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"JENNIFER LEANING: Now\nwhy did you--"},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"why did you know that was\nthe right decision?"},"646":{"dur":3,"text":"LORD NIGEL CRISP: Well, I think\nit was interesting."},"649":{"dur":0,"text":"One of the decisions--"},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"and I went through a few\ndifferent sorts of decisions."},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"But this was one of those\ndecisions where the evidence"},"655":{"dur":1,"text":"was very clear."},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"I think if you'd ask any doctor\naround to look at the"},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"evidence, they would have said\nthe golden hour, the first"},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"hour for trauma, is really\nserious and significant."},"664":{"dur":1,"text":"It was well-established."},"665":{"dur":1,"text":"But nobody did it."},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"Don't know how well you do it\nin the US, but actually, in"},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"the UK, basically we still had\nthe process that actually, if"},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"you turned up in the middle\nof the night, you"},"675":{"dur":1,"text":"saw the junior person."},"677":{"dur":1,"text":"So the evidence was\nvery clear there."},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"And the other thing that was\nright for me is that he was"},"681":{"dur":3,"text":"going to deal with it himself."},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"He was a leader who was going\nto make it happen."},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"JENNIFER LEANING: How many years\ninto your tenure did"},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"this proposal come

him."},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"JENNIFER LEANING: So there's\nsomething instinctive about"},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"how you assess people."},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"LORD NIGEL CRISP:\nWell, there is."},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"You can know a good proposal."},"704":{"dur":3,"text":"But I have to say, I also went\nand rang up the

good?"},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"So you did get some\ncross-references."},"717":{"dur":1,"text":"Let me tell you another story,\nthough, about that hospital,"},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"before we get on to the\npolitics, which is that about"},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"a year later, a GP\ncame and saw me."},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"And she'd got breast cancer, and\nshe said, Nigel, you run"},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"an awful service in\nthis hospital."},"729":{"dur":1,"text":"Absolutely awful."},"730":{"dur":1,"text":"Do you know what you do with\nwomen with breast cancer?"},"731":{"dur":0,"text":"You put them in with\nall the other"},"732":{"dur":1,"text":"general surgery patients."},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"And there, they're disdressed\nfor surgery and they're stuck"},"737":{"dur":3,"text":"in with people who've got\nhernias and completely"},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"You should be taking\nthem out of that."},"742":{"dur":1,"text":"So I listened to that."},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was a powerful and\nemotive argument."},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"And I took it to the surgeons\nand the others."},"749":{"dur":1,"text":"And the nurses said,\nyeah, of course,"},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"The surgeons said, well, that'd\nbe impossible, really,"},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"because actually, we've got our\noperating schedules, and"},"755":{"dur":1,"text":"we can't do it."},"757":{"dur":1,"text":"It won't work."},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"And the nurses I then ended up\nworking with-- and this is an"},"761":{"dur":4,"text":"example where I actually had to\nput my foot down, where the"},"765":{"dur":1,"text":"nurses and people actually\npointed out, you could"},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"actually go into the operation\nin the Churchill Hospital, as"},"769":{"dur":3,"text":"opposed to the JR Hospital,\nwhich is half a mile away."},"773":{"dur":3,"text":"And people didn't particularly\nwant to do that, because it"},"776":{"dur":2,"text":"did involve moving across."},"779":{"dur":3,"text":"But the surgeons and all took\nthe view that actually, OK,"},"782":{"dur":3,"text":"maybe we should do that-- all\nexcept for one individual."},"785":{"dur":1,"text":"And in the end, I had to have\nhim in my office and say,"},"787":{"dur":1,"text":"actually, we're going to do\nthis, and you're either on"},"789":{"dur":1,"text":"board or you're off board."},"791":{"dur":4,"text":"And what was interesting there\nis that actually, I got away"},"795":{"dur":4,"text":"with that because of passive\nresistance rather than active"},"799":{"dur":0,"text":"resistance."},"800":{"dur":1,"text":"People knew that was the right\ndecision, and therefore, it"},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"was acceptable for me as a\nmanager to be taking that"},"804":{"dur":2,"text":"strong line and pushing it."},"807":{"dur":3,"text":"Because there's an issue here\nabout context, isn't it?"},"810":{"dur":3,"text":"And in health care, there are\nso many powerful people."},"813":{"dur":3,"text":"Decisions aren't clean cut as\nthey are in some other places."},"816":{"dur":1,"text":"You've got to take\npeople with me."},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"So on the one example, I had\nthese clinicians leading the"},"820":{"dur":4,"text":"way and wanting to make the\nchange happen, and I had to"},"824":{"dur":0,"text":"provide air cover."},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"And on this other one,\nI had to make the"},"827":{"dur":2,"text":"decisions and push it."},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"And I wasn't opposed."},"832":{"dur":1,"text":"And that was a really\ninteresting point."},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"And they're two very different\nsorts of decisions,

an"},"850":{"dur":2,"text":"extraordinarily larger\nscale when you came"},"852":{"dur":1,"text":"in to lead the NHS--"},"854":{"dur":3,"text":"that is, passive resistance\nor a clinician leader."},"858":{"dur":1,"text":"Did that pattern come--"},"859":{"dur":1,"text":"LORD NIGEL CRISP: Well, it got\nmuch more complicated."},"861":{"dur":3,"text":"Because as we've already said in\nthat first bit, the context"},"865":{"dur":1,"text":"and power are very important."},"866":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, just because you're\nlabeled chief executive, it"},"868":{"dur":1,"text":"does mean to say you're\npowerful."},"870":{"dur":2,"text":"Don't be misled by titles."},"872":{"dur":2,"text":"You've actually got to work out\nwhere the power is and how"},"875":{"dur":2,"text":"you use it."},"877":{"dur":3,"text":"And of course, in government,\nyou've then got politics at a"},"880":{"dur":0,"text":"major scale."},"881":{"dur":2,"text":"And this was serious,\nheavy politics,
