in"},"478":{"dur":4,"text":"She wasn't able to negotiate tight spaces very well"},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"She would just walk straight to Bhagavan"},"485":{"dur":1,"text":"because she loved him so

animal"},"517":{"dur":4,"text":"Now Lakshmi grew up, became a full-sized cow"},"521":{"dur":4,"text":"and started to have calves of her own"},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"and what is quite

that"},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"Lakshmi liked iddlis"},"596":{"dur":3,"text":"Iddlis are the standard South Indian breakfast"},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"And one day, Lakshmi walked into the

respond in the way he did"},"868":{"dur":3,"text":"because she had such unconditional love for him"},"872":{"dur":3,"text":"There is one story that is reported by"},"875":{"dur":1,"text":"Shantammal,

then, as everyone was dispersing"},"1052":{"dur":3,"text":"Bhagavan took Annamalai Swami aside"},"1056":{"dur":4,"text":"and said that, \"I don't want a cowshed in this
