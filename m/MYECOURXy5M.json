camera gear,"},"17":{"dur":1,"text":"across the coast of Canada,"},"19":{"dur":3,"text":"I just wanted to give you\na little bit of background,"},"23":{"dur":2,"text":"so I'm based in\nBozeman, Montana,"},"25":{"dur":3,"text":"it's so beautiful, and\nthis is a little cabin"},"29":{"dur":2,"text":"that I stay at quite often,"},"31":{"dur":3,"text":"but most of the time,\nI'm on the road."},"34":{"dur":3,"text":"And I know most of you\nhave houses or apartments,"},"38":{"dur":3,"text":"and maybe you're looking out\nthe door at a front yard,"},"41":{"dur":4,"text":"or backyard, but my view\noften looks like this."},"46":{"dur":3,"text":"This is my front\nyard, or back yard."},"49":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm also based out of my bright\nyellow truck, named Happy,"},"55":{"dur":4,"text":"very unstealthy, it's about\nNational Geographic yellow,"},"61":{"dur":4,"text":"but this is my view a lot of\ntimes when I'm on the road,"},"65":{"dur":3,"text":"and I was spending so much\ntime on the road last year,"},"68":{"dur":1,"text":"that I actually\nhad a friend help"},"70":{"dur":3,"text":"build me a bed in the\nback of the truck,"},"73":{"dur":1,"text":"it's way more\ncomfortable that way,"},"75":{"dur":3,"text":"so you can see the two\nstorage systems on the side,"},"78":{"dur":3,"text":"and then I have this\nbed in the middle,"},"81":{"dur":3,"text":"which my dog and I fit\nperfectly in that little nook,"},"84":{"dur":4,"text":"and obviously, a coffee\ndevice, in the corner."},"88":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughter)"},"90":{"dur":2,"text":"And I would argue\nthat this is actually"},"92":{"dur":3,"text":"more comfortable\nthan my bed at home."},"95":{"dur":3,"text":"So I know I just said I\nspend a lot of time outside,"},"99":{"dur":2,"text":"or on the road, but I\njust wanted to give you"},"101":{"dur":1,"text":"some statistics about how much"},"103":{"dur":2,"text":"time I actually spend outside,"},"106":{"dur":2,"text":"so last year, I kept track,"},"108":{"dur":3,"text":"and last year, I slept\noutside for 242 nights,"},"114":{"dur":4,"text":"which estimates to be roughly\neight months of the year,"},"119":{"dur":3,"text":"that means I was inside\nabout 123 nights,"},"124":{"dur":1,"text":"which also means,"},"125":{"dur":3,"text":"I only took about 123\nshowers last year,"},"129":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughter)"},"131":{"dur":2,"text":"which is not that much,\nbut don't be

most of my showers\nlooked like this,"},"143":{"dur":3,"text":"so being an adventure\nphotographer means"},"148":{"dur":3,"text":"I get to see incredible places,"},"151":{"dur":2,"text":"my day is not ever the same,"},"156":{"dur":2,"text":"it just keeps me on my toes,"},"158":{"dur":2,"text":"as you can see, there's\nquite a diversity"},"160":{"dur":2,"text":"of images in this picture."},"163":{"dur":2,"text":"But yeah, it's always different,"},"165":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's part of the\nreason I love this job,"},"168":{"dur":2,"text":"the only thing\nconsistent is I drink"},"170":{"dur":4,"text":"a very, very strong cup\nof coffee every morning."},"175":{"dur":2,"text":"But 90% of my job is really fun,"},"178":{"dur":2,"text":"and right now, I'm working for\na lot of outdoor companies,"},"180":{"dur":1,"text":"creating content,"},"182":{"dur":3,"text":"a few of these photos have\nnot yet been published,"},"185":{"dur":2,"text":"so you get to see them first,"},"188":{"dur":1,"text":"so yes, quite diversity."},"189":{"dur":2,"text":"90% of my job is really fun,"},"192":{"dur":3,"text":"and the other 10% is\ntotally

the\npoint where it was"},"223":{"dur":2,"text":"such a terrible\nblizzard outside,"},"226":{"dur":1,"text":"that I could no\nlonger see the people"},"227":{"dur":2,"text":"I was taking photos

okay,"},"237":{"dur":1,"text":"we could go home."},"240":{"dur":1,"text":"Or there's days like this,"},"241":{"dur":1,"text":"where the elements turned me"},"243":{"dur":2,"text":"into a beautiful

wearing five\njackets, in this picture,"},"257":{"dur":1,"text":"and the condensation\nfrom my breath,"},"259":{"dur":2,"text":"because it was\nso cold outside,"},"261":{"dur":3,"text":"created this awesome\nice beard in my hair,"},"264":{"dur":3,"text":"and I couldn't pull it\napart, until it melted,"},"268":{"dur":3,"text":"which wasn't until about\n11:00 in the morning."},"272":{"dur":1,"text":"And at these\ntemperatures, you're also,"},"274":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm being very\naware of frostbite,"},"277":{"dur":2,"text":"and one of the people I was with"},"279":{"dur":2,"text":"started to get\nfrostbite on her toes,"},"281":{"dur":2,"text":"so again, turned\naround and went back,"},"284":{"dur":4,"text":"because, also part of this job\nis knowing when to call it."},"290":{"dur":2,"text":"Or there are days like this,"},"292":{"dur":1,"text":"it poured rain,"},"294":{"dur":3,"text":"last year, I was on an\nexpedition with this

finished\nits last episode,"},"309":{"dur":2,"text":"so you can still watch\nit, check it out."},"312":{"dur":2,"text":"But in this photo,\nwe're about 75 miles"},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"off the coast of\nVancouver Island,"},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"we're the only\npeople on the island,"},"320":{"dur":1,"text":"and we waved at our float plane"},"321":{"dur":1,"text":"as they dropped us off,"},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"hoping that we had\nenough food and gear,"},"325":{"dur":3,"text":"and that our sat\nphone was working."},"328":{"dur":3,"text":"And Bertie is building\na wildlife hide,"},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"which is, basically,\na wildlife blind,"},"334":{"dur":1,"text":"and it breaks up your shape,"},"336":{"dur":1,"text":"because we were on the coast,"},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"and we wanted to try and find"},"340":{"dur":3,"text":"coastal wolves for\nthis expedition,"},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"we needed a way to\nbreak up the shapes,"},"345":{"dur":1,"text":"so we would sit in this hide,"},"347":{"dur":3,"text":"and this actually\ncontributed to about"},"350":{"dur":2,"text":"one month's of my not showering,"},"353":{"dur":2,"text":"because you can't\nalter your scent,"},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"wolves will smell you,"},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"or wildlife has pretty\ngreat sense of smell."},"360":{"dur":4,"text":"So no showering was a\nstrict rule for this trip,"},"365":{"dur":2,"text":"and I feel bad for\nour float plane pilot,"},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"that had to take us home."},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"But in situations like this,\nwhere it's pouring rain,"},"374":{"dur":4,"text":"you're starting to be kind\nof concerned about your gear,"},"378":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's a question\nthat I get a lot is,"},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"how are you dealing\nwith your gear"},"383":{"dur":1,"text":"when you're out in the field"},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"in the elements\nfor the whole time?"},"386":{"dur":3,"text":"And the truth is, it gets\nfirst priority in your tent,"},"389":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughter)"},"391":{"dur":1,"text":"you must have a good tent,"},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"you need to really\ntrust your equipment."},"395":{"dur":3,"text":"But this is about a\nquarter of our gear,"},"400":{"dur":1,"text":"actually, I'm\nholding one camera,"},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"there's a few more behind\nme that you can't see,"},"404":{"dur":2,"text":"this is a four person tent,"},"407":{"dur":1,"text":"and in the spaces\nwhere two other people"},"409":{"dur":4,"text":"would typically lay, was\nall of our camera gear."},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"When you want to\nstretch out, you can't,"},"414":{"dur":3,"text":"because there's batteries behind\nyou, batteries beside you,"},"418":{"dur":1,"text":"and we had to start sleeping"},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"with batteries in\nour sleeping bags,"},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's not because they're,"},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"like, I have a weird\nthing with batteries,"},"427":{"dur":3,"text":"it actually helps\nprolong the life of them,"},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"so if they're not, warmingup \nand cooling,"},"432":{"dur":1,"text":"and warming up and cooling,"},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"you can just stick them\nin your sleeping bag,"},"436":{"dur":1,"text":"and your body heat\nhelps keep them warm"},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"and they last longer."},"443":{"dur":3,"text":"But I haven't always been\nan adventure photographer,"},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"I haven't always\nbeen on Instagram,"},"450":{"dur":1,"text":"which I will tell you about,"},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"but I started Instagram in 2012,"},"455":{"dur":4,"text":"and at the time, it was just\nbeing used as a really casual"},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"way to share parts of your life."},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"And no one was really\nusing it for business"},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"or for promotion\nand so part of a,"},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"a really fun part of pulling\ntogether this presentation,"},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"is I dug through my images"},"475":{"dur":3,"text":"and found my very\nfirst Instagram photo,"},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"which I am so\nexcited to show you."},"481":{"dur":1,"text":"It's really compelling,"},"482":{"dur":0,"text":"(laughter)"},"483":{"dur":0,"text":"my dog,"},"484":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughter)"},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"this is my dog Vedauwoo,"},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"this is her sun\nbathing position,"},"494":{"dur":3,"text":"and I saw her draped over this\ngarden hose in the back yard,"},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"I thought it was funny,"},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"because she pulls her\nlegs up like a T-Rex,"},"501":{"dur":1,"text":"when she gets like that."},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"And obviously, pretty comedic,"},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"so on my iPhone, I\nthough it was funny,"},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"snapped a photo, put\nlike four filters on it,"},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"because that's what you did,"},"515":{"dur":1,"text":"and then posted it to Instagram,"},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"so not a lot of forethought."},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"Also, my favorite\nsection of the bookstore,"},"523":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughter)"},"525":{"dur":3,"text":"again, though it was funny,\ntook a photo with my iPhone,"},"528":{"dur":4,"text":"posted it immediately,\nnot a lot of forethought."},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"So I had, Instagram, as an app,"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"and I was also\nstorytelling on the side,"},"541":{"dur":1,"text":"but it never really\noccurred to me"},"542":{"dur":1,"text":"that I could do both,"},"544":{"dur":1,"text":"that I could\ncombine that effort,"},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"because no one was really\nusing it like that."},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"So in 2010, I had won a grant,"},"552":{"dur":1,"text":"from the University of Wyoming,"},"554":{"dur":3,"text":"to go document post Hurricane\nKatrina in New Orleans,"},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"and how they were recovering,"},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"so this was kind of my first\nexperience in the field,"},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"and that project led to\na National Geographic"},"567":{"dur":3,"text":"Young Explorer's grant\nto document post tsunami,"},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"Banda Aceh, Sumatra,"},"572":{"dur":3,"text":"that was pretty\ndecimated by the

opportunity,"},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"and please come talk\nto me afterwards,"},"590":{"dur":3,"text":"because it got my foot in the\ndoor with National Geographic,"},"594":{"dur":3,"text":"and it funded my first\nbig field project"},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"was documenting the tsunami,"},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"and I had a kind of similar idea"},"603":{"dur":1,"text":"for my Young Explorers grant"},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"on how Banda Aceh\nwas recovering,"},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"and I feel like this\nphoto really sums it up,"},"612":{"dur":3,"text":"in my entire project,\ninto this image."},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"I like to play a\ngame with this photo,"},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"called find the boat,"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"yeah, sort of in the middle."},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"This barge had floated inland,"},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"and you can see the coastline,"},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"in this photo, so a couple\nmiles it floated in,"},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"and it settled there,"},"635":{"dur":2,"text":"and instead of tear it apart,"},"637":{"dur":3,"text":"the Indonesians decided,\nwe'll just build around it."},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can pay a penny,"},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"and you can walk\nup onto the barge,"},"644":{"dur":4,"text":"and look out over the city\nof Banda Aceh, Sumatra."},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"But really, really interesting."},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"So I came back from my\nYoung Explorers project,"},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"so jazzed about photography,"},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"like, this is what I \nwanted to do,"},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"I was living my dream."},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"But there was this\nbig jump in my head"},"665":{"dur":3,"text":"between what I just\ngot to do as a grantee,"},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"and being a full\ntime photographer,"},"671":{"dur":3,"text":"and I didn't really know\nhow to make that jump."},"677":{"dur":3,"text":"So I was working for\nthe State of Wyoming,"},"680":{"dur":1,"text":"as a grant writer,"},"682":{"dur":1,"text":"and I decided to save\nup a bunch of money,"},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"and that I would go travel."},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"So I ended up taking\ntime off of that job,"},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"and traveling to\njust shoot photos,"},"692":{"dur":3,"text":"because that's the only\nthing I knew how to do,"},"695":{"dur":3,"text":"and the only thing I\nreally wanted to do."},"699":{"dur":3,"text":"So this road trip ended up\nbeing about 32,000 miles"},"703":{"dur":4,"text":"around the American West,\njust with my dog and I,"},"707":{"dur":1,"text":"this is on a small break."},"709":{"dur":3,"text":"A mouse had climbed into\nmy engine compartment,"},"713":{"dur":3,"text":"and at the time, I was\nsleeping in this vehicle,"},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"like, I was sleeping\nin the truck,"},"718":{"dur":1,"text":"and the entire night,"},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"I could hear it run\nacross the dashboard,"},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"and it kept me up all night,"},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"so this is like 5:00\nam in the morning."},"728":{"dur":1,"text":"And little did I know,"},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"my traveling around the West\nand creating these images,"},"735":{"dur":3,"text":"just because I wanted to,\nand because I loved it."},"738":{"dur":4,"text":"It was creating this kind of\nvisual diary on Instagram,"},"742":{"dur":4,"text":"I made the switch, I stopped\ntaking pictures with my iPhone,"},"746":{"dur":3,"text":"and posting them, just\ntaking photos with my camera,"},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"and posting them there."},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"And I had no idea that\npeople were paying attention"},"755":{"dur":3,"text":"until I started to\ngather this audience,"},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"and when I hit 20,000 followers,"},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"my mom wanted to get me a cake,"},"764":{"dur":0,"text":"(laughter)"},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"and I was like, no, no, no."},"768":{"dur":1,"text":"No, no, no, people don't\ndo that, thank you though,"},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"very, very kind."},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"But I didn't really realize that"},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"people wanted to see\nwhat I was shooting"},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"until I started to\ngather this audience."},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"So at the very end\nof 2014, I decided,"},"784":{"dur":3,"text":"I would make the jump into\nfull time freelancehood,"},"787":{"dur":4,"text":"and it was like, a major,\nmajor leap of faith for me."},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"And, so as soon as I, like,"},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"publicly announced that I was"},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"going into full\ntime photography,"},"799":{"dur":3,"text":"I immediately panicked,\nI was like, oh no,"},"803":{"dur":1,"text":"maybe this isn't right."},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"And so when I panic,\nI go fly fishing,"},"809":{"dur":3,"text":"so I left for a week\non a fly fishing trip"},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"in the back country of Montana."},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"And when I came out\nof the back country,"},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"I had an email from someone,"},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"and I thought it was spam,"},"823":{"dur":2,"text":"it wasn't spam, it was\nfrom a fly fishing company"},"826":{"dur":4,"text":"that wanted me to shoot their\nentire campaign for that year,"},"831":{"dur":2,"text":"and when I finally spoke\non the phone to them,"},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"and asked them how on\nEarth they had found me,"},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"they said, through Instagram."},"839":{"dur":2,"text":"And that was my first\nfreelance job was,"},"842":{"dur":1,"text":"they found me there."},"846":{"dur":8,"text":"So, for most of the half of\nthe 2015, the first half,"},"854":{"dur":4,"text":"this is last year, I got\nthat fly fishing job in 2014,"},"858":{"dur":3,"text":"and then I didn't get\nanother email for months."},"862":{"dur":1,"text":"Again, panic,"},"865":{"dur":1,"text":"so I decided, okay,"},"868":{"dur":1,"text":"I would go on more trips,"},"870":{"dur":3,"text":"because I knew that\nit was a gamble,"},"873":{"dur":3,"text":"but it was an investment\nin making more images,"},"877":{"dur":1,"text":"things that were compelling,"},"878":{"dur":1,"text":"and things that I wanted to see."},"880":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think it shines through,"},"882":{"dur":4,"text":"when you're doing something\nthat you really love."},"886":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, I started\ncreating things like this,"},"889":{"dur":1,"text":"just totally diverse,"},"891":{"dur":2,"text":"and then it struck me\npart way through 2015,"},"894":{"dur":3,"text":"that I could kind of start\nleveraging the audience"},"898":{"dur":4,"text":"that I had built on\nInstagram to companies,"},"902":{"dur":2,"text":"or for projects\nthat I wanted to do,"},"905":{"dur":1,"text":"I wanted to travel,"},"906":{"dur":2,"text":"and so I would send\nout notes to companies,"},"908":{"dur":3,"text":"and say, \"are you interested\nin this expedition?\""},"911":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's how the expedition\nto Panama was born."},"916":{"dur":2,"text":"This is my friend\nClare Fieseler,"},"919":{"dur":3,"text":"who is a fellow Young\nExplorer grantee,"},"922":{"dur":2,"text":"and my favorite\nexpedition partner."},"925":{"dur":4,"text":"And we had been in\ncontact with this company"},"930":{"dur":3,"text":"called Oru Kayak,\nand we had proposed,"},"933":{"dur":1,"text":"it was Clare's idea,"},"936":{"dur":2,"text":"to circumnavigate this island"},"938":{"dur":3,"text":"outside of Panama\ncalled Bastimentos,"},"942":{"dur":3,"text":"and you can see it up\nthere, with the little pin,"},"945":{"dur":2,"text":"it doesn't look that big,"},"947":{"dur":2,"text":"but it was a four day trip."},"951":{"dur":3,"text":"And we had two\nobjectives for the trip,"},"955":{"dur":3,"text":"one, do a social media\nstory for Oru

we decided we\nshould probably"},"993":{"dur":2,"text":"make sure we like each other,"},"996":{"dur":4,"text":"before we jump into\na multi-month trip."},"1000":{"dur":3,"text":"So we started having\nthese Skype phone calls,"},"1003":{"dur":3,"text":"and we're, at this time,\nin two different countries,"},"1006":{"dur":3,"text":"and both of us are\ntraveling really frequently."},"1009":{"dur":2,"text":"So this Skype conversation\nwas the last one"},"1011":{"dur":2,"text":"before I went to Panama,"},"1014":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'm, obviously\nhad a headlamp
