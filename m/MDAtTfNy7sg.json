candidate shapes"},"568":{"dur":5,"text":"has soared to about 10 to the 500."},"573":{"dur":3,"text":"So, what to do?"},"576":{"dur":3,"text":"Well some researchers lost

physics"},"730":{"dur":3,"text":"giving us definitive explanations for the features we observe."},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"But the point is,"},"735":{"dur":3,"text":"if the feature you're

reality,"},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"then thinking one explanation"},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"for a particular value"},"749":{"dur":3,"text":"is simply misguided."},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"An early example"},"754":{"dur":3,"text":"comes from the great astronomer Johannes Kepler"},"757":{"dur":2,"text":"who was obsessed with understanding"},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"a different number --"},"761":{"dur":4,"text":"why the Sun is 93 million miles away from the Earth."},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"And he worked for decades trying to explain this number,"},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"but he never

planets"},"778":{"dur":3,"text":"at a wide variety of different distances from their host stars."},"781":{"dur":3,"text":"So hoping that the laws of physics"},"784":{"dur":3,"text":"will explain one
