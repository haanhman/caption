{"11":{"dur":6,"text":"I'm going to give you some of the secrets about how we make you buy what we want you to buy."},"18":{"dur":4,"text":"So, as a marketer, when I'm first giving you a product, what's my job?"},"22":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, my job is to make you want it, to crave it, to need it."},"27":{"dur":5,"text":"To think that is the best innovation in food since, well, since sliced bread."},"33":{"dur":1,"text":"But how do we do it?"},"34":{"dur":3,"text":"Well I'm going to give you a really big example later that I'm going to break right down for you,"},"38":{"dur":2,"text":"but let's just start by look at a few fun little things."},"41":{"dur":7,"text":"So here we have 'Shreddies', an old favourite, been around for years, very popular in the UK and Canada."},"48":{"dur":5,"text":"Without changing a single little thing about that product, they re-marketed them, re-branded them,"},"54":{"dur":6,"text":"as brand new 'Diamond Shaped Shreddies'. Food marketing genuis right there."},"62":{"dur":7,"text":"In the 1950s there was a very important innovation in food, the instant mix cake. One of my personal favourites."},"69":{"dur":5,"text":"When they were first brought out all you needed to do was to add a little bit of water, who's not going to love that?"},"75":{"dur":3,"text":"Well actually no one loved it, no one bought the bloody things."},"79":{"dur":8,"text":"So they did a bit of research and what they found was that the main consumer, the target consumer, the housewife, felt that it was cheating."},"87":{"dur":6,"text":"They didn't want to pass off such an easy thing as their own baking to their partners, their husbands, their families, whatever."},"95":{"dur":1,"text":"So what did the producers have to do?"},"97":{"dur":7,"text":"They had to make it harder, so now you had to add water and an egg. And sales eggsploded!"},"107":{"dur":4,"text":"But these examples, these are just chicken feed compared to what I really want to talk about tonight,"},"111":{"dur":3,"text":"and that is chickens, and pigs and cows."},"115":{"dur":8,"text":"So when we think about where chickens etcetera come from, we think about it a bit like that, that's sort of our insinctive idea."},"123":{"dur":5,"text":"But we all know if we really think about it, if we think about it deeply, it's probably a little bit more like that."},"128":{"dur":3,"text":"But that's a lot nicer, it's a lot more romantic."},"132":{"dur":4,"text":"So how do we give you this impression? Well, there are three techniques that we use,"},"137":{"dur":6,"text":"the third of which is our secret weapon and I am going to blow it for you tonight so please stay primed for that."},"143":{"dur":5,"text":"Let's look at technique number one: everybody believes what's on the label."},"150":{"dur":4,"text":"So let's look at some examples, some of my favourites, some of the ones I use all the time."},"154":{"dur":7,"text":"I'll use 'Farm Fresh', I'll use '100% natural, I'll use 'Butcher's choice'."},"161":{"dur":5,"text":"But what does that really actually mean? Well truthfully it doesn't mean very much."},"167":{"dur":2,"text":"We see that on the label, we feel a bit more confident."},"169":{"dur":3,"text":"But let's look at what a farm really looks like, it probably looks like that."},"172":{"dur":3,"text":"Now this is a concentrated animal feeding operation."},"177":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm going to run that past you again, it's a concentrated animal feeding operation."},"180":{"dur":3,"text":"That's not going to look great on a label, hence we use 'Farm Fresh'."},"185":{"dur":4,"text":"Innovation number two, this is what we use, we focus on progress."},"190":{"dur":4,"text":"Intensive farming was born out of necessity."},"194":{"dur":5,"text":"At the end of the Second World War, resources were extremely tight."},"199":{"dur":5,"text":"Farming had to be, it had to be by necessity very, very economical."},"205":{"dur":6,"text":"And we've learnt from that and we've built from that and we're able to now raise more and more animals in smaller and smaller spaces."},"211":{"dur":5,"text":"So we've got extremely good at it. If we looked at room about this size and this was turned into a chicken barn,"},"217":{"dur":4,"text":"it's a one hundred seat theatre, how many chickens could we probably fit in this room now?"},"222":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm going to say about four thousand. It's pretty impressive isn't it?"},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"It would probably look a little bit like that."},"230":{"dur":5,"text":"Now the public aren't going to be massively keen on that, it's my job to make them feel a little bit better about it."},"236":{"dur":4,"text":"So how do I do it? Well, a basic principal in marketing."},"240":{"dur":8,"text":"We use the right choice of words, and by using the right choice of words, we can focus the conversation the way we want it to."},"249":{"dur":3,"text":"So we use an example like this. When you look at that picture where is your eye drawn?"},"252":{"dur":4,"text":"It's drawn right to the middle of the page, massive letters, we've got 'strive to optimize'."},"256":{"dur":4,"text":"What we're looking at in the picture, in reverse, looks a bit like that."},"260":{"dur":6,"text":"But this looks a lot nicer because we're looking at 'strive to optimize', it makes us feel like there's progress, we feel good."},"268":{"dur":5,"text":"So the challenge for the marketers is to make the public feel comfortable about what they're seeing."},"274":{"dur":7,"text":"One of the side effects of intensive farming, of having so many animals in such a small space, unfortunatly, is obviously disease."},"281":{"dur":3,"text":"Because you put so many animals in a small space, they're going to get sick."},"285":{"dur":5,"text":"It is no secret that fifty percent of all the antibiotics in the world are used on farmed animals."},"291":{"dur":3,"text":"So how do you make the public feel okay with this? How does that happen?"},"295":{"dur":5,"text":"My Job! How do I do it? I use the language of innovation."},"300":{"dur":4,"text":"So we go back to our old friends at porkcares.org, and what they do is, they say:"},"304":{"dur":6,"text":"As farming has become more efficient, veterinarians have incorporated new technologies and methods into practice."},"310":{"dur":3,"text":"This makes us feel good, this is positive, yes? This is progress."},"314":{"dur":6,"text":"And when we're then marketing to future consumers, we would perhaps use something like this."},"321":{"dur":3,"text":"This is a colouring book. 'Pigs and Pork'."},"325":{"dur":1,"text":"It's absolutely gorgeous."},"326":{"dur":4,"text":"What we're doing here is we're getting the children to focus on the fact that we're using innovation."},"330":{"dur":5,"text":"So by bringing the pigs out from the muddy fields and into the clean barns,"},"335":{"dur":7,"text":"we're taking them away from all that nasty dirty mud and all the diseases that are lurking there within. Positive."},"342":{"dur":3,"text":"So onto our secret weapon, this is what we really need to focus on."},"346":{"dur":6,"text":"So these two techniques alone, they are not going to work, we need a secret weapon, number three."},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"It is actually in this room right now."},"355":{"dur":1,"text":"*Calls out* Secret weapon!"},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"It is... You!"},"362":{"dur":1,"text":"But how do we do it?"},"365":{"dur":4,"text":"When you're in the supermarket, you don't want to want to think about where those products have come from."},"369":{"dur":4,"text":"You don't want to think about how those animals have been reared, how they've been treated."},"374":{"dur":5,"text":"The power of willful ignorance cannot be overstated."},"381":{"dur":3,"text":"This is systemised cruelty on a massive scale,"},"385":{"dur":5,"text":"and we only get away with it because everyone is prepared to look the other way."},"393":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you."}}
