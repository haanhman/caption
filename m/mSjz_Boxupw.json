it."},"347":{"dur":1,"text":"Not sure what that\nmeans, but I'm kind of"},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"trying to follow that advice."},"351":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm kind of curious,\nwhat have you

an\narticle recently,"},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"but you kind of made a\ncomment that you felt this way"},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"at one point in your career."},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"ALAINA PERCIVAL: I definitely\nfelt this way myself."},"371":{"dur":4,"text":"I'd been working with Women\nWho Code for over two years."},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"I was a leader in\nthe

am."},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"And so finally, I just had to\nsay to myself, you know what?"},"408":{"dur":1,"text":"If a software engineer\ntakes this role,"},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"then we're actually going\nagainst our mission,"},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"because she wouldn't\nbe a software engineer."},"414":{"dur":1,"text":"So I guess I can do this."},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I had to\nactually

opportunity."},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"It was a huge organization."},"480":{"dur":3,"text":"I was taking on a team of 600\nemployees, 600 contractors."},"486":{"dur":4,"text":"I'd managed a team of\nabout 150 at max before."},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"So it was one of those\nopportunities where"},"494":{"dur":3,"text":"I kept saying, I can't\npossibly be qualified for it."},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"But everyone kept\nsaying, no, we actually"},"499":{"dur":1,"text":"want you to take the role."},"501":{"dur":1,"text":"And I did."},"502":{"dur":6,"text":"And what I'll say is I\nlearned a lot about myself"},"509":{"dur":1,"text":"through the process."},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think-- I\nread a lot about,"},"512":{"dur":3,"text":"sometimes we have to take\nthe opportunities that"},"516":{"dur":3,"text":"are presented sometimes, even\nif they seem like they're well"},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"beyond something\nwe can actually do,"},"522":{"dur":3,"text":"because everyone knew\nthat I hadn't been a CIO."},"525":{"dur":3,"text":"I had a lot of resources, a\nlot of people, a lot of advice,"},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"a lot of mentors."},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was really incredible."},"533":{"dur":3,"text":"And the good thing is that now\nI've learned a lot about myself"},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"through that, which\nis really important."},"538":{"dur":1,"text":"ALAINA PERCIVAL: So\nwith Women Who Code,"},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"we really work to make sure that\nyou have a network of people,"},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"so that when you start to run\nthese things through your mind,"},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"like can I be the\nCIO of Motorola?"},"549":{"dur":0,"text":"Yes."},"550":{"dur":0,"text":"Yes, you can."},"551":{"dur":0,"text":"That's fantastic."},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"JULIE PEARL: Should have\ncalled you at the

it."},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"They're not going to give\nyou a job until you're ready."},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"So just go ahead and do it."},"577":{"dur":4,"text":"And so having that network, and\nbuilding those relationships,"},"581":{"dur":3,"text":"and being really authentic\nfrom the beginning,"},"584":{"dur":3,"text":"it doesn't matter if your goal\nis coming out two years later,"},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"or five years later."},"589":{"dur":4,"text":"You're taking those\nsteps, and it becomes fun."},"594":{"dur":4,"text":"And what happens is that those\nopportunities open up for you."},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"JULIE PEARL: That's great."},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"So Google's developed\nthis program"},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"we call Unconscious Bias."},"605":{"dur":0,"text":"And--"},"606":{"dur":1,"text":"JULIE PEARL: Yeah, it's\nreally fascinating."},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"And employees are going through\nthis training by which we're"},"611":{"dur":4,"text":"really learning about what--\nin many ways, how decisions are"},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"being made, and what the\ninformation is that we're"},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"using to make those decisions."},"620":{"dur":5,"text":"And I'm kind of curious,\nyour take on examples"},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"of unconscious bias that\nyou've seen that maybe you"},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"could share with us."},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"ALAINA PERCIVAL: So I think this\none is incredibly important."},"632":{"dur":4,"text":"And as I'm saying big numbers\nlike, hey, Woman Who Code,"},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"our goal is to reach\na million women."},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"We're currently\nreaching over 25,000."},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"Actually, I'm realizing\nthat we have a lot of power"},"644":{"dur":5,"text":"with the over 100 companies that\nare supporting Women Who Code."},"650":{"dur":4,"text":"And so what we're\nhearing is, hey, it's"},"654":{"dur":5,"text":"not some big dramatic thing that\ncauses you to run out the door."},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"It's little tiny things\nthat are happening day"},"662":{"dur":4,"text":"after day that make\nyou wonder if this"},"666":{"dur":1,"text":"is the right career\nfor you, make"},"667":{"dur":5,"text":"you wonder if you're good enough\nfor the role that you're doing."},"672":{"dur":6,"text":"And so I hear everything from\nI create colorful spreadsheets,"},"679":{"dur":1,"text":"and my team makes fun of me."},"681":{"dur":3,"text":"Or a woman told me\nrecently-- and she's"},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"in a very senior position."},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"And she was working\nwith a French colleague,"},"689":{"dur":5,"text":"and he said, oh, I've never\nhad to explain infrastructure"},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"to a woman before."},"695":{"dur":3,"text":"And she's like, just\nimagine me to be Tom."},"699":{"dur":0,"text":"Don't worry."},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"And those are really clear."},"703":{"dur":4,"text":"But then there's the more\nsubtle things that-- project"},"707":{"dur":1,"text":"distribution, something\nthat you were really"},"709":{"dur":3,"text":"wanting to get on that\nother people somehow"},"712":{"dur":1,"text":"managed to get on it."},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"And you know, was\nI not good enough?"},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"Was there hidden bias there?"},"718":{"dur":3,"text":"And so it's sometimes\neasier to process"},"722":{"dur":1,"text":"the things that\nare clearly like,"},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"oh, they just didn't get it."},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"But sometimes, there's the\nmore subtle things that"},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"make you wonder, was it me?"},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"And they're little,\nlittle tiny things"},"733":{"dur":3,"text":"that happen day after day."},"736":{"dur":6,"text":"But I think that with hidden\nbias training and building"},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"awareness that\nthis exists, we're"},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"able to process it better, and\nhopefully improve the workplace"},"748":{"dur":4,"text":"environment, so that it's\nhappening less frequently."},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"JULIE PEARL: I work with\nsome female engineers who"},"755":{"dur":5,"text":"have been complaining recently\nbecause we've had some events"},"760":{"dur":1,"text":"with the outside community."},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"And they often believe that the\nGoogle engineers at the event"},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"are coordinating, or\npart of marketing,"},"769":{"dur":4,"text":"and they're not being recognized\nimmediately as engineers."},"773":{"dur":6,"text":"And how do we make sure that\neven other people at the event"},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"can call people\non that behavior,"},"782":{"dur":4,"text":"and not making assumptions\nabout what people's roles are?"},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"ALAINA PERCIVAL: I\nhad a couple of women"},"790":{"dur":3,"text":"who had come to Google I\/O, and\nthis was not at a Google event,"},"793":{"dur":1,"text":"but it was at an after party."},"795":{"dur":3,"text":"And this young engineer was\nlike, well, why are you here?"},"798":{"dur":3,"text":"And they said, oh,\nwe're Android engineers."},"802":{"dur":1,"text":"We're here for the conference."},"804":{"dur":4,"text":"And he was mortified, of course."},"808":{"dur":3,"text":"JULIE PEARL: We have a\nlot of improvement to do."},"811":{"dur":1,"text":"ALAINA PERCIVAL: That\nwas completely unrelated."},"813":{"dur":1,"text":"JULIE PEARL: Oh, yeah."},"814":{"dur":2,"text":"So we've seen a lot of\ncompanies recently releasing"},"817":{"dur":1,"text":"their diversity data."},"819":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think it's a great thing\nin terms of being transparent."},"822":{"dur":4,"text":"But obviously, we have\na long way to go there."},"827":{"dur":2,"text":"What do you think\ncompanies can do"},"829":{"dur":4,"text":"to increase the diversity of\ntheir employee population?"},"833":{"dur":2,"text":"ALAINA PERCIVAL: So these\nnumbers when they come out,"},"836":{"dur":4,"text":"they are disappointing."},"840":{"dur":3,"text":"But the fact that companies\nare putting this information"},"844":{"dur":2,"text":"out there is a commitment\nto seeing change."},"846":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is incredibly exciting."},"849":{"dur":6,"text":"And so the next steps are, like\nyou said, how do we do this?"},"855":{"dur":3,"text":"And one is increasing\nthe pipeline."},"859":{"dur":3,"text":"Two is making sure that you're\nreaching a broad community"},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"in your recruiting."},"865":{"dur":5,"text":"And then the other side is\nthat numbers are coming out,"},"870":{"dur":4,"text":"like 56% of women are leaving\ntheir technical careers"},"874":{"dur":5,"text":"at the mid-career level,\nafter about 10 years."},"880":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is a major\nleaky bucket issue."},"882":{"dur":3,"text":"And if we can't correct that,\nwe're not going to reach 50%."},"886":{"dur":2,"text":"Women aren't a minority."},"888":{"dur":3,"text":"Women are actually\n51% of the population."},"892":{"dur":3,"text":"And so really\nworking-- and I think"},"895":{"dur":2,"text":"that Google's in an\namazing position,"},"897":{"dur":5,"text":"because you love doing research,\nand you have the ability"},"902":{"dur":6,"text":"to find out really\nwhat's happening here,"},"909":{"dur":1,"text":"and how can we change it."},"911":{"dur":4,"text":"And so really\ncreating opportunities"},"915":{"dur":3,"text":"where women understand\nthat, hey, there"},"918":{"dur":4,"text":"are next steps in your\ncareer-- creating mentorship"},"922":{"dur":6,"text":"and advocacy programs in the\ncompany, checking to make sure"},"928":{"dur":2,"text":"that there's not a wage gap."},"930":{"dur":5,"text":"And it's tough to tell a company\nto make a decision that's"},"935":{"dur":3,"text":"not fiscally responsible."},"939":{"dur":6,"text":"But the reality is is if you\nknow that you're earning less"},"945":{"dur":3,"text":"than your male counterpart,\nand you have an opportunity"},"949":{"dur":2,"text":"to change careers, or\nyou have an opportunity"},"952":{"dur":2,"text":"to drop out of\nyour career, you're"},"954":{"dur":1,"text":"a little bit more\nlikely to do that."},"956":{"dur":5,"text":"And so you're missing out on\nthat 20 years of a woman's"},"962":{"dur":3,"text":"career where she is in the most\nsenior position, where she's"},"965":{"dur":2,"text":"providing the most\nvalue to the company,"},"967":{"dur":2,"text":"and when she's\nalso in a

10-year mark on average?"},"992":{"dur":1,"text":"Or examples?"},"994":{"dur":4,"text":"I think some companies are\nstarting to look at job shares."},"998":{"dur":2,"text":"Are there other things

certainly"},"1004":{"dur":3,"text":"having a lot of\nadvocacy programs,"},"1008":{"dur":2,"text":"so making sure that\nwomen have mentors,"},"1011":{"dur":4,"text":"creating a culture\nof celebrating
