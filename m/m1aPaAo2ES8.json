avoid\narmchair activism."},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"Can you start there?"},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"TOM FLETCHER: Yeah."},"690":{"dur":4,"text":"So my main worry\nabout social

in\ncompletely different ways."},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"So, for example, when the\nIranian embassy was blown up,"},"707":{"dur":3,"text":"rather than deliver a speech--\nI couldn't go down and shake"},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"hands with the ambassador\nbecause we didn't have"},"713":{"dur":3,"text":"diplomatic relations-- I\nwent down and donated blood"},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"and then tweeted the photo\nand it went viral in Tehran."},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was one way of\nshowing the Iranian people"},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"that what they were being told\nabout Britain and the West--"},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"you know, just challenge\nit a little bit."},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we found ways\nto do things like that."},"729":{"dur":1,"text":"They were stunts."},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"And many of my colleagues said\nthese are just ridiculous,"},"733":{"dur":1,"text":"attention-grabbing stunts."},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"But they were stunts\nthat had a purpose."},"736":{"dur":1,"text":"We were trying to\nuse these new tools,"},"738":{"dur":1,"text":"trying to build that\nplane as we flew it,"},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"to find different ways to

Absolutely."},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"TOM FLETCHER: But in that\nspace that we're competing for,"},"750":{"dur":1,"text":"you've got obviously\nthe bad guys."},"751":{"dur":3,"text":"And Islamic State are\ndoing a fantastic job,"},"755":{"dur":1,"text":"from their perspective,\nof using gaming,"},"757":{"dur":2,"text":"for example, to\nradicalize people."},"759":{"dur":1,"text":"And then you've got\na bunch of people"},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"who are just being\ndistracted, and for whom"},"763":{"dur":4,"text":"social media is making them a\nbit more apathetic, a bit more"},"768":{"dur":1,"text":"It's sort of switching them off."},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's one of the\nreasons, I think,"},"772":{"dur":4,"text":"why people are trusting\nmy world of maps and

looks\nlike authority"},"785":{"dur":3,"text":"just provokes a sort\nof cynical backlash."},"788":{"dur":0,"text":"FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah."},"789":{"dur":0,"text":"TOM FLETCHER: And\nso somehow, we have"},"790":{"dur":1,"text":"to find a way to ensure\nthat people aren't just"},"792":{"dur":3,"text":"using social media\njust to flirt or look"},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"at pictures of cute

diplomacy."},"802":{"dur":1,"text":"And they're insane."},"804":{"dur":1,"text":"They're absolutely\ninsane, right?"},"805":{"dur":1,"text":"So like letting every\nother

some of these\ntraditions maybe"},"856":{"dur":2,"text":"should be disrupted\nregardless, or were in line"},"858":{"dur":1,"text":"to be disrupted regardless."},"860":{"dur":1,"text":"So I look at
