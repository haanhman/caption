it\nwas San Antonio, Texas."},"203":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I really started\ngrowing up there."},"206":{"dur":3,"text":"And I have to say that I never\nthought of fashion as fashion,"},"209":{"dur":3,"text":"like I didn't know the\nfashion industry existed."},"212":{"dur":2,"text":"In the former\nSoviet Union, it was"},"214":{"dur":2,"text":"like everybody was wearing

I decided to go shopping."},"272":{"dur":2,"text":"And I went on\nWilshire Boulevard."},"275":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'm just walking on Wilshire."},"276":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't know if you\nguys, any of you know LA?"},"278":{"dur":2,"text":"But it's like a-- anyway,\nthere's large department stores"},"281":{"dur":2,"text":"So I was walking by one\nof the department

was the most beautiful\nthing I've ever had on."},"317":{"dur":1,"text":"I started twirling in the dress."},"319":{"dur":6,"text":"I mean just having a good time,\nuntil I saw the price

$1,500."},"334":{"dur":0,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"So that it was\nnot going to work."},"337":{"dur":3,"text":"And at that moment,\nas I was looking"},"341":{"dur":3,"text":"at myself in the mirror, at\nthat moment that pain hit me."},"344":{"dur":2,"text":"The pain was that\nI'm not good enough."},"347":{"dur":0,"text":"What am I doing here?"},"348":{"dur":3,"text":"People like me don't\nwear clothes like that."},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"Really, like all\nthe negative things"},"354":{"dur":2,"text":"just started flowing through me."},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"And I started crying, but\nsort of tearing up more."},"359":{"dur":1,"text":"And then I pulled\nmyself together."},"361":{"dur":3,"text":"I looked in the mirror\nand I said, if I ever,"},"364":{"dur":1,"text":"ever become a\ndesigner, I will never"},"366":{"dur":1,"text":"make clothes that\nare that expensive."},"368":{"dur":4,"text":"I will never make a\nwoman feel this pain."},"372":{"dur":3,"text":"Nobody deserves\nto feel this pain."},"375":{"dur":1,"text":"And I made that promise."},"376":{"dur":1,"text":"I took off my dress."},"378":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, again, I didn't know it\nthat I wanted to be a designer."},"381":{"dur":1,"text":"I had no idea."},"382":{"dur":1,"text":"Took off the dress,\nput it on the hanger,"},"384":{"dur":5,"text":"zipped it up, thanked the\nsales people, and left."},"389":{"dur":1,"text":"Next day, believe it\nor not-- not next day,"},"391":{"dur":3,"text":"but like two days after,\na fashion school came in."},"395":{"dur":3,"text":"And I filled out,\nsaying I liked fashion."},"398":{"dur":1,"text":"I like this."},"399":{"dur":3,"text":"My whole life from that moment\non-- it's like in that movie"},"403":{"dur":3,"text":"when you make a promise,\neverything, like, starts"},"407":{"dur":3,"text":"opening for you, everything\nin my life from that point on."},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"I went to fashion school-- well,\nI filled out a application."},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"The next thing I knew, I\nwas in the fashion school."},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"The next thing I\nknew, I had a job."},"418":{"dur":4,"text":"It was just everything\nwas just incredibly--"},"422":{"dur":3,"text":"it's like my destiny was\ncreated at that moment."},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"And I don't know if any of\nyou had that experience."},"427":{"dur":3,"text":"But it's just sort of, you do\nthing and you make a promise."},"431":{"dur":1,"text":"And then everything\nin your life changes."},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"And so to me,\nfashion represents--"},"436":{"dur":1,"text":"it's not just about clothes."},"437":{"dur":1,"text":"But it's about\nmaking a difference."},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"Do you know I'm saying?"},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"I believe that if you make a\nwoman feel and look beautiful,"},"443":{"dur":1,"text":"she can make this\nworld a better place."},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"LISA LEE: So it looks like\nit all crystallized for you."},"446":{"dur":0,"text":"LUBOC AZRIA: Yeah."},"447":{"dur":0,"text":"Yeah."},"448":{"dur":1,"text":"LISA LEE: And so\nfrom that point on,"},"449":{"dur":3,"text":"how does that experience--\nhow does that translate"},"453":{"dur":4,"text":"to your designs today, and\nthe labels, and what you do?"},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"LUBOC AZRIA: Well, it\ntranslates in every way."},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean until this day, I\nfit every single piece."},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"I also kind of realized\nthat-- for example, I"},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"don't know if you know\nanything about making clothes."},"468":{"dur":3,"text":"But you can take a dress that\nyou're wearing, for example."},"474":{"dur":1,"text":"You can take a dress\nlike this and you"},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"can have it 10 times\nmore expensive,"},"478":{"dur":3,"text":"if you don't think about the\nmarker, and the fabrication,"},"481":{"dur":0,"text":"and how it moves."},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"So we really engineer\neverything to give you"},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"the best price that we can."},"488":{"dur":3,"text":"Because I believe that a\nwoman has to feel good."},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"Most designers\ndon't appreciate, I"},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"think, the consumer and\ntheir spending power."},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"Or their knowledge, I\nthink I would want to say."},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"Like, women are so much smarter."},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"You don't have to be in fashion\nbusiness to understand fashion."},"504":{"dur":1,"text":"You don't have to be."},"505":{"dur":1,"text":"You know what you like."},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's the most\nimportant thing."},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"Fashion is about\nconnecting with something."},"512":{"dur":3,"text":"So what I do is I create\nclothes that I want to wear."},"515":{"dur":2,"text":"It's so interesting because\nin design, we always"},"518":{"dur":1,"text":"think that we're somebody else."},"519":{"dur":0,"text":"But we're not."},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"We're women."},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"The majority of my\nteam is also females."},"524":{"dur":1,"text":"And then we love what we do."},"526":{"dur":1,"text":"We get excited\nabout the product."},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"We can't wait to\nwear it ourselves."},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"We can't wait to create\na product that we"},"532":{"dur":1,"text":"respect and want to wear."},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think that's\nthe difference."},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"We don't have to\ndo a lot of things."},"537":{"dur":5,"text":"Like I will not create clothes\njust to create clothes."},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"I really want somebody\nwearing it and feeling"},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"beautiful and elegant."},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"And I believe that\nyou live one life."},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"How do you want\nto live your life?"},"552":{"dur":1,"text":"Do you want to\nhide behind clothes"},"553":{"dur":1,"text":"or do you want to\ncelebrate yourself?"},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"And if somebody would\ntake a picture of you"},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"every single day, would\nyou be proud of that?"},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, one life."},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"And so to me, that's\nvery important."},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"LISA LEE: That's really,\nreally inspirational."},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think it's something\nfor people to keep in mind."},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"But many of us\nhere, I'm sure, are"},"573":{"dur":4,"text":"busy working women, as well\nas some of us have kids."},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"And so how do you\nbalance that in terms"},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"of getting up every day and\nto think about yourself first,"},"582":{"dur":3,"text":"as opposed to your family and\nall the other responsibilities?"},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"LUBOC AZRIA: Well, like I said,\nthink about yourself first."},"587":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean there's a safety\nmessage on the plane."},"591":{"dur":4,"text":"It says when the\noxygen mask comes down,"},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"put it on yourself first,\nand then on your children."},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think a lot of\nwomen don't do that."},"600":{"dur":1,"text":"We tend to take care\nof everybody else."},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"And then we feel like\nsomething's wrong with us."},"605":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think truly taking care\nof yourself is so important."},"608":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'm not talking\nabout that idea."},"609":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm talking about exercising,\neating right, doing the things"},"613":{"dur":0,"text":"that you love."},"614":{"dur":3,"text":"If you love, for example, I\ndon't know, roller blading,"},"617":{"dur":0,"text":"go rollerblade."},"618":{"dur":3,"text":"If you love, making jewelry--\nif you love anything,"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"do you know what I'm saying,\nmake sure you're doing it."},"624":{"dur":3,"text":"Because that is what's\ngoing to satisfy who you are"},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"and create-- in life,\nyou don't find yourself."},"629":{"dur":0,"text":"You create yourself."},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"So create the type of\nperson that you want to be."},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"Most people go around\nthe world and go, oh,"},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"this person is so chic."},"636":{"dur":0,"text":"She was born that way."},"637":{"dur":1,"text":"She wasn't born that way."},"638":{"dur":1,"text":"She created herself."},"640":{"dur":1,"text":"Do you now what I'm saying?"},"641":{"dur":0,"text":"She learned."},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"And she wanted to\nbe that person."},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"So you become that."},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think in terms of\nbalance and being a mom,"},"648":{"dur":1,"text":"I think being a mom\nis one of the greatest"},"650":{"dur":1,"text":"gifts in the world."},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean those kids are\nour greatest teachers."},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"And yes, they're tough."},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"But that's because they're\ntrying to find who they are."},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"And we just have\nto let them grow."},"662":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think being friends with\nyour children is so important."},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"I think we're always trying\nto tell them what to do."},"667":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think, don't."},"669":{"dur":1,"text":"I think they'll do\nthe right thing."},"670":{"dur":1,"text":"I notice the less I\ntell them what to do,"},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"the more strict they\nare on themselves."},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"And I have five\ndaughters so it's"},"676":{"dur":1,"text":"kind of like-- it's\na party at the house."},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"LISA LEE: So I have to\nask, because my daughter,"},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"they always decide\nwhat they want to wear."},"682":{"dur":1,"text":"And it doesn't always match."},"684":{"dur":0,"text":"LUBOC AZRIA: Oh."},"685":{"dur":0,"text":"LISA LEE: And you're\nlike, do you really"},"686":{"dur":1,"text":"want to put those\ntwo things together?"},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"So do you let them\nexperiment and let them?"},"689":{"dur":0,"text":"LUBOC AZRIA: Yes."},"690":{"dur":4,"text":"Actually, I think that's how you\ncreate fashion, by being wrong."},"694":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't think fashion should--\nI mean we don't match here."},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a piece that she likes."},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"She probably likes this\ngreat pair of shoes"},"701":{"dur":3,"text":"and she just wants-- it's about\ncertain things that they love."},"705":{"dur":1,"text":"And let them do it."},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean I remember my kids,\nI couldn't get them out"},"709":{"dur":4,"text":"of Halloween costumes\nfor, like, a year."},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"And I said, hey, if you want\nto be a superwoman, go ahead,"},"716":{"dur":3,"text":"every single day, or tutus."},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean that was, like, number\none search word, right?"},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"Or like a item, tutu

is."},"733":{"dur":1,"text":"Just let her be."},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean obviously she\nhas a reason for it."},"737":{"dur":1,"text":"How beautiful is that?"},"738":{"dur":0,"text":"LISA LEE: Right."},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"And so you often hear\npeople define their style."},"741":{"dur":6,"text":"They saying I'm casual or\nI like the bohemian look."},"747":{"dur":0,"text":"Do you believe in that?"},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"Or do you feel like it's-- like\nyou talked about experimenting."},"751":{"dur":3,"text":"And so what is behind\nthat definition"},"755":{"dur":2,"text":"and do you encourage women\nto sort of throw that"},"758":{"dur":1,"text":"out the window and\nsay just wear what"},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"you feel is most comfortable\nand defines you for the day?"},"761":{"dur":0,"text":"LUBOC AZRIA: Uh-uh."},"762":{"dur":1,"text":"I think it depends\non your lifestyle."},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that most\nof us-- I mean,"},"766":{"dur":1,"text":"it depends if you\nwant to blend in."},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"Like, I think that women\nshould experiment with stuff."},"771":{"dur":0,"text":"I think that's playing."},"772":{"dur":2,"text":"Do you remember when we used\nto play with clothes, dress-up,"},"775":{"dur":0,"text":"and all this?"},"776":{"dur":0,"text":"We stopped playing."},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"We stopped experimenting."},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"We stopped living."},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're taking fashion too\nserious, you're doing it wrong."},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"You're supposed to go in and try\nevery single thing in the store"},"788":{"dur":1,"text":"and have fun."},"789":{"dur":3,"text":"Because women do not\ndress based on trends."},"792":{"dur":3,"text":"They dress based on\ntheir body shape, period."},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"You know what's going to\nlook good on you, right away."},"798":{"dur":1,"text":"You don't need a\nsalesperson to tell you."},"800":{"dur":2,"text":"So you know if you look\ngood in strapless dresses,"},"802":{"dur":1,"text":"you wear strapless dresses."},"803":{"dur":2,"text":"If you look good in v-neck,\nyou look good in v-neck."},"808":{"dur":1,"text":"That's because you know it."},"810":{"dur":2,"text":"You put it on and it's right."},"812":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's the difference."},"815":{"dur":1,"text":"Comfort, obviously, is\nextremely important."},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"But you can be\nelegantly comfortable."},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"LISA LEE: So when you are\nfeeling a little down or maybe"},"823":{"dur":2,"text":"feeling you don't quite\nhave the confidence,"},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"what's your go-to outfit that\nyou'd sort of recommend

influenced\nyour focus on comfort?"},"860":{"dur":1,"text":"Because obviously\nas a dancer, you"},"861":{"dur":1,"text":"need to be able to\nflow with the clothes."},"863":{"dur":1,"text":"And how has that\ninfluenced your life?"},"865":{"dur":2,"text":"LUBOC AZRIA: Well, I think\nas a dancer, one thing that I"},"867":{"dur":1,"text":"learned is discipline."},"868":{"dur":2,"text":"I think you have
