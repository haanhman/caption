program,"},"330":{"dur":3,"text":"and many of you or some of you \nmay have done the program like this."},"333":{"dur":3,"text":"So picture a team of faculty, \nkind of your dream team of

it"},"357":{"dur":3,"text":"with that team of instructors\nand develop that rapport."},"361":{"dur":3,"text":"And then using technology \nthat we have now,"},"364":{"dur":3,"text":"we could secure an online class room,"},"368":{"dur":4,"text":"so that, that dream team moves,\na few weeks later, to another prison."},"372":{"dur":4,"text":"And you start to build a series \nof concurrent online

You can do something\nwith a history degree!"},"392":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"395":{"dur":3,"text":"You can have science degrees, \nyou can have engeneering,"},"398":{"dur":3,"text":"there's so

services."},"407":{"dur":1,"text":"What else can we do?"},"408":{"dur":1,"text":"So we take that dream team,"},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"and we also add to it\ncompetency-based degrees."},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"And we take \nthe life experience of inmates."},"416":{"dur":4,"text":"Our inmates come to us\nwith a lifetime of experience."},"421":{"dur":4,"text":"And while they are in prison,\nthey gain a lifetime of experience."},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"And we evaluate it,\nthrough careful assesments,"},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"and we identify\nwhat are those skills that they have?"},"430":{"dur":1,"text":"What are those skills they need?"},"432":{"dur":2,"text":"And you combine that \nwith that low-residency program"},"435":{"dur":3,"text":"and now you can get \nthat much closer to degrees,"},"438":{"dur":3,"text":"opening up the number of possibilities\nfor our students."},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, we add other technologies."},"446":{"dur":4,"text":"So we added a tablet, a simple tablet"},"450":{"dur":3,"text":"like a iPad kind of thing,"},"454":{"dur":4,"text":"that we load with all the lectures, \nall the materials, the textbooks,"},"458":{"dur":3,"text":"in our case, we would use \nopen educational resources"},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"because they come \nwith the amazing price of free,"},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"and we load that textbook"},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"with everything \nthat an inmate student would need."},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"So when a two-week lock-down happens,"},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"the education doesn't end,"},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"and with that tablet"},"478":{"dur":3,"text":"we combine that \nwith this form of education."},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"And we expand those possibilities."},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"And these are all using technologies \nthat exist now!"},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"We're moving them from the streets,"},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"securely moving them into the prison!"},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"But then there's preschool."},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"Preschools and prisons \nhave a lot in common."},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"They all have similar rules:"},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"Keep your hands \nand your feet to yourself,"},"508":{"dur":5,"text":"no biting, hitting, spitting, no running."},"517":{"dur":4,"text":"Prisons have wreck,\npreschools have recess,"},"522":{"dur":5,"text":"prisons have hobby-craft, \npreschools have arts and crafts,"},"527":{"dur":3,"text":"prisons and preschools, both have music,"},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"and they both, \nhave lots and lots of drama."},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"538":{"dur":3,"text":"But they also share\none other thing in common:"},"541":{"dur":3,"text":"They are both about creating a space,"},"544":{"dur":4,"text":"a space where the individual \ncan learn or re-learn,"},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"how to be in the world."},"552":{"dur":4,"text":"So let me draw on two examples \nfrom our preschool program."},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"Many of you wil remember\nhaving Lincoln Logs sets,"},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"those little logs, with the little pieces"},"561":{"dur":2,"text":"and you put them together to build forts."},"564":{"dur":4,"text":"At our preschool, we recently made\na real Lincoln logs set,"},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"and I mean 6 foot long Lincoln Logs."},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"And we did that intentionally,"},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"because the only way to make it work,"},"576":{"dur":4,"text":"is for those children to work together."},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"Because no one child can move \na 6 foot long Lincoln log!"},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"They have to work together to build"},"586":{"dur":4,"text":"and so they learn through that exercise\nthe joy of creating,"},"590":{"dur":1,"text":"when you get to create something,"},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"when you get to destroy something,"},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"that you get the owners permission."},"597":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"598":{"dur":4,"text":"You have that opportunity\nto build together."},"603":{"dur":1,"text":"The other thing we know"},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"is that no significant learning happens"},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"without a significant relationship."},"610":{"dur":3,"text":"And we know, when you think back \nto your experiences as a child,"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"that it is those early relationships"},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"with those teachers that are so vital."},"620":{"dur":1,"text":"So we take those 2 ideas"},"622":{"dur":3,"text":"and how do we incorporate those\ninto this furture vision?"},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"Well we do it in subtle ways."},"629":{"dur":1,"text":"I used to work with an inmate"},"631":{"dur":3,"text":"who had committed\nabsolutely terrible crimes."},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"And even when he was incarcerated,"},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"he committed some terrible assaults."},"640":{"dur":3,"text":"But he had changed,\nmade some other decisions,"},"644":{"dur":3,"text":"and now he was working\nin our adult basic education classroom."},"648":{"dur":3,"text":"And he was learning \nhow to take cassette tapes..."},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"--some of you may not know \nwhat those are--,"},"655":{"dur":0,"text":"(Laughter)"},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"--I 've just realized that!--,"},"658":{"dur":4,"text":"and digitizing them \nand putting them next to books"},"662":{"dur":1,"text":"so that low literacy students"},"664":{"dur":2,"text":"could read and hear the words \nat the same time."},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"It was really frustrating for him."},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"As he's working through that \nhe'd come to me:"},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Mr Walsh, I don't know how to do this!\""},"674":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'd say:"},"675":{"dur":4,"text":"\"I don't know how to do it either,\nbreak it 'till it works!\""},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"And he'd go back, and he'd work on it"},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"and he'd work on it, \nand he'd come to me and say:"},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"\"I broke it again, I got to restore it!"},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"I broke it again, but i'm getting closer!"},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm breaking it till it works!\""},"690":{"dur":3,"text":"And he's experiment with it\nin a safe enviroment."},"696":{"dur":3,"text":"In our horticulture program \nI had a student"},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"who had never once gardened,"},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"who had never had\nanything to do with plants."},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"And we know\nthat horticulture is theraputic."},"706":{"dur":3,"text":"And he came to me, or I came to him"},"710":{"dur":3,"text":"and he was showing me \nwith just this utter joy on his face,"},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"what he was able to bring into the world:"},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"a garden plot that he had planted,"},"718":{"dur":1,"text":"that he had taken care of,"},"720":{"dur":4,"text":"and at the same time\nhe was learning botany and biology."},"726":{"dur":4,"text":"I had a student who I had expelled \nfrom our business program."},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"It was really not a good fit \nfor him there,"},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"and so he'd eventually chosen \nto end up in our baking program."},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"And the one thing I know \nabout that baking program"},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"is that I have an instructor, \nwho everyday, when I ask him"},"744":{"dur":1,"text":"how things are going, he says:"},"746":{"dur":3,"text":"\"I'm just having so much fun!\""},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"And this student, in that class,\ncould make"},"753":{"dur":3,"text":"the most beautiful braided breads \nthat you've ever seen."},"757":{"dur":1,"text":"He'd make challah, and I can guarantee"},"759":{"dur":4,"text":"we were the only challah producer \nfor about 70 miles on the

completed changed\nwhen he found that place"},"773":{"dur":3,"text":"where he could connectedly,\nand artistically, express himself."},"778":{"dur":1,"text":"In our business
