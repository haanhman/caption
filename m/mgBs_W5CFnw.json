person,"},"85":{"dur":3,"text":"and over all of the years\nthat I have been doing therapy,"},"89":{"dur":3,"text":"I would say that the biggest\nsuffering that I meet"},"93":{"dur":2,"text":"is people

years,"},"104":{"dur":3,"text":"or you have done wonderful\nprojects in the world,"},"107":{"dur":5,"text":"seems to be a very troubling situation\nin our society today."},"113":{"dur":4,"text":"It's

I'm defining it,"},"135":{"dur":4,"text":"is actually the tendency that we have"},"140":{"dur":3,"text":"to make ourselves\nthe center of our experience."},"144":{"dur":5,"text":"That is, that we imagine\nthat we control our lives;"},"150":{"dur":2,"text":"we imagine that we can manage things;"},"153":{"dur":5,"text":"we imagine that our consciousness\ncomes from, somehow, inside ourselves,"},"159":{"dur":3,"text":"from our brain or from\nour awareness or whatever."},"163":{"dur":3,"text":"And then, with this sense\nof self-importance,"},"167":{"dur":6,"text":"that is, this focus on ourself as center,\nwe don't feel important at all."},"174":{"dur":5,"text":"Instead, actually, we often feel\nhaunted by negative commentary,"},"179":{"dur":4,"text":"like judging ourselves\nin terms of the way we look;"},"183":{"dur":3,"text":"what we are capable of doing;"},"187":{"dur":4,"text":"we compare ourselves to others\nin terms of our thinness,"},"191":{"dur":4,"text":"our wealth, our fastness, our smarts,"},"196":{"dur":3,"text":"and we always come up lacking."},"200":{"dur":1,"text":"Even if we feel superior,"},"202":{"dur":2,"text":"we come up lacking\nbecause we feel superior."},"205":{"dur":2,"text":"I had a young man come\nto see me in therapy one day,"},"207":{"dur":2,"text":"and he sat down across from me -"},"211":{"dur":3,"text":"very nice looking, graduated\nfrom a college like Middlebury,"},"214":{"dur":3,"text":"it wasn't Middlebury -\nand I said, \"So what's up?\""},"217":{"dur":3,"text":"And he said, \"I am suffering\nfrom feelings of superiority.\""},"221":{"dur":3,"text":"And, of course, those feelings\nmade him feel very bad about himself."},"224":{"dur":4,"text":"So, this tendency\nto feel that we control our lives,"},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"and that we manage things ourselves,"},"231":{"dur":2,"text":"actually has been enhanced\nin this period of time;"},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"you must recognize that."},"236":{"dur":2,"text":"And it is a very big mistake."},"239":{"dur":3,"text":"We are not the fixers\nor the fashioners of our own lives,"},"242":{"dur":2,"text":"but it's a mistake\nthat we're making a lot,"},"245":{"dur":5,"text":"and pretty much, I think,\nuntroubled by reality in making it."},"251":{"dur":3,"text":"So, let me look at happiness, then,\nin the way that I'm defining it,"},"254":{"dur":3,"text":"because I think that happiness"},"257":{"dur":3,"text":"is something you all recognize\nfrom your own experience."},"262":{"dur":4,"text":"And I'm defining happiness\nas that state of being"},"266":{"dur":2,"text":"in which you do not\nwant to be in another state."},"270":{"dur":3,"text":"When you're happy, you're not restless,\nyou're not distracted."},"274":{"dur":2,"text":"You don't have a desire\nto be doing something else."},"277":{"dur":5,"text":"In fact, you're completely engaged\nand involved in your direct experience."},"283":{"dur":3,"text":"And you recognize this\nfrom your own experience:"},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"it occurs when you're making love -"},"290":{"dur":1,"text":"not always, but sometimes -"},"292":{"dur":3,"text":"it occurs when you're,\nmaybe, rock climbing -"},"296":{"dur":3,"text":"maybe again, not always,\nbut a lot of the time -"},"300":{"dur":2,"text":"sometimes when you're\ndoing yoga, meditating,"},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"problem-solving certain kinds of problems,"},"306":{"dur":1,"text":"certain kinds of creativity."},"308":{"dur":2,"text":"It's been widely studied,\nand sometimes it's called"},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"'being in the flow'\nor 'being in the zone.'"},"314":{"dur":3,"text":"So what happens to your self\nwhen you're really happy"},"317":{"dur":3,"text":"is that that sense of self\ndrops away altogether, doesn't it?"},"321":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, you forget yourself."},"322":{"dur":4,"text":"You're certainly not comparing yourself\nto someone else at those moments"},"327":{"dur":1,"text":"or you lose that flow."},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"We all know that in our experience."},"332":{"dur":3,"text":"Also, when we're in this state\nof happiness, as I'm calling it,"},"336":{"dur":5,"text":"we don't have the experience or the sense\nthat we are fashioning our own world."},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"Instead, our ideas come to us."},"345":{"dur":3,"text":"And they seem to come in a way\nthat's kind of like a flow,"},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"in other words,\nwhether we want them or not."},"351":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, instead of having this sense\nthat we're thinking things up,"},"354":{"dur":1,"text":"or we're making something happen,"},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"it seems as though\nthings are happening to us."},"359":{"dur":4,"text":"So, you can see right off\nthat there's a real contrast"},"363":{"dur":4,"text":"between this kind of self-importance\nin which we don't feel important at all,"},"368":{"dur":4,"text":"and happiness, in which\nthe sense of self disappears."},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"I became a Buddhist a long time ago -"},"376":{"dur":4,"text":"it seems embarrassingly long, actually,\nI think I may be 105 up here;"},"381":{"dur":3,"text":"actually I'm older than I look,\nand I don't like to talk about my age,"},"384":{"dur":4,"text":"because I feel there's a lot of prejudice,\nso I'm not going to tell you how old I am;"},"388":{"dur":1,"text":"you can find out easily."},"390":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"Everything's on the web these days."},"394":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I did take vows in 1971,"},"398":{"dur":3,"text":"and I practice something\ncalled Zen Buddhism"},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"and also something called Vipassana,"},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"and I've been practicing for many years;"},"406":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm now a meditation teacher\nas well as a lot of other things."},"410":{"dur":4,"text":"Also, I became a psychologist,\nin 1980 I finished my PhD."},"415":{"dur":3,"text":"And in 1986 I became a Jungian analyst,"},"419":{"dur":3,"text":"so I did a lot of 'becoming'\nfor a long time."},"422":{"dur":3,"text":"And then I've done a lot\nof practicing of those things."},"426":{"dur":6,"text":"And over these years I've really wondered\nabout trying to put together two things"},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"that come from these practices\nthat are hard to convey."},"436":{"dur":5,"text":"One thing is a self - the sense of\nwhat is an individual self?"},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"If I ask you guys,\n\"What do you think a self is?\""},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"I'd get as many answers\nthat there are people in the room."},"448":{"dur":1,"text":"And the other thing"},"450":{"dur":3,"text":"is this Buddhist teaching\nof no-self or non-self"},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"- very hard to convey to people,"},"454":{"dur":4,"text":"even though it's kind of available to you\nwhen you're having direct experience,"},"459":{"dur":1,"text":"as I implied a moment ago."},"461":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I have actually\nbrought along a painting"},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"that could help us a little bit"},"468":{"dur":3,"text":"in putting together these two concepts\nthat are hard to teach."},"472":{"dur":3,"text":"This is actually a contemporary replica"},"475":{"dur":5,"text":"of a fifth or sixth century\ntype of Chinese landscape painting."},"482":{"dur":6,"text":"As you see, the world is presented\nas a vast and mysterious place."},"489":{"dur":3,"text":"And over here, on a cliff,"},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"those are us, there; that's you."},"496":{"dur":5,"text":"Tiny little being, intense little being,\nlittle story-telling being"},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"that stands on the edge of the cliff"},"504":{"dur":4,"text":"and looks out at this vast world\ntelling stories."},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, the Chinese meant to indicate"},"512":{"dur":5,"text":"that we should pay much more attention\nto this vast and mysterious world"},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"than to this little point over here,"},"521":{"dur":4,"text":"because they believed that nature\nwas actually making us conscious,"},"525":{"dur":1,"text":"that it was teaching us."},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, in this period of time,"},"529":{"dur":5,"text":"we have a much more complex sense\nof a lot of things than the Chinese had."},"535":{"dur":4,"text":"But I think this painting helps\nin one very important way,"},"539":{"dur":6,"text":"which is that the world\nas it is appearing to you and to me,"},"545":{"dur":3,"text":"in this moment,\nwe are in this space together,"},"550":{"dur":3,"text":"all together and all at once."},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"That means I'm not over here\nwith my little separate self,"},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"and you're over there with yours;"},"559":{"dur":4,"text":"we are participating in a fabric of being\nthat we do not understand."},"564":{"dur":5,"text":"And if you are not fascinated\nby that all of the time,"},"570":{"dur":5,"text":"it is because you're collapsing\nback into this tiny little center,"},"575":{"dur":4,"text":"and you are worrying yourself to death\nwith your self-consciousness."},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"So, why do we do this?"},"584":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, psychology has helped us understand"},"588":{"dur":4,"text":"that there are certain emotions\nthat motivate human beings,"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"that do not motivate the other animals."},"595":{"dur":4,"text":"We often talk about how we're animals,\nand how we're like the other animals,"},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"but there are some ways\nthat we're really different."},"603":{"dur":5,"text":"And one of those ways\nis our self-conscious emotions."},"608":{"dur":6,"text":"These emotions begin to develop\nin the second half of the first year -"},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"18 months to two years."},"617":{"dur":4,"text":"By the two year time,\nwe have what we call the 'terrible twos,'"},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"because the toddler is saying,"},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"\"No. I'm in here; the world is out there."},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"This is mine; and no.\""},"629":{"dur":5,"text":"And that's the beginning of the birth\nof the ego in the human being,"},"634":{"dur":4,"text":"and then that development\nof the self-conscious emotions,"},"638":{"dur":4,"text":"it continues, particularly\nthrough our maturation,"},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"until about 25 years old,"},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"and gives us what we call\n'executive functioning' -"},"647":{"dur":3,"text":"our ability to govern our lives,\nto make decisions for ourselves."},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"At the same time,\nthese self-conscious emotions"},"655":{"dur":5,"text":"do not drop away once\nthey're no longer needed for motivation,"},"660":{"dur":5,"text":"but they actually organize our being,\nmoment to moment,"},"666":{"dur":3,"text":"when our, you might say, ego is aroused."},"670":{"dur":3,"text":"And at that moment,\nwe're motivated to feel"},"673":{"dur":3,"text":"that we are separate\nfrom everything that's out there"},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"and to compare ourselves to others."},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"That's what these emotions do."},"682":{"dur":4,"text":"They do many good things for us,\nbut they also load onto us"},"687":{"dur":3,"text":"an enormous load of negativity,\nif we engage in them."},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"So, I've put four"},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"of the self-conscious emotions up here"},"695":{"dur":3,"text":"that are an example\nof the way that they motivate us."},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"This is not the whole list."},"700":{"dur":4,"text":"I will just say that the others\nthat are often talked about"},"705":{"dur":4,"text":"are pride, and self-pity,\nand embarrassment,"},"710":{"dur":5,"text":"but these four are biggies when it comes\nto how you feel about yourself."},"715":{"dur":3,"text":"So let me focus\nespecially first on 'shame.'"},"718":{"dur":5,"text":"Shame is one of the self-conscious\nfeelings that the very best people"},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"that come to see me in therapy\ngenerally feel a lot of;"},"728":{"dur":6,"text":"and this is the desire\nto hide, cover up, lie, or die"},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"because you feel defective,"},"737":{"dur":3,"text":"because you feel like\nthere's something about you"},"741":{"dur":3,"text":"that you cannot change, that is just you,"},"745":{"dur":3,"text":"but it's different from other people\nin a defective way."},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"And of course, it might\nbe feelings of inferiority -"},"751":{"dur":1,"text":"more often it's that -"},"753":{"dur":1,"text":"sometimes feelings of superiority,"},"755":{"dur":5,"text":"as the young man who sat across from me\nand said he was suffering from that."},"761":{"dur":4,"text":"But the feeling of shame is not\nthe same thing as the feeling of guilt."},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"Guilt is the desire to repair wrong-doing."},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"Shame is the desire\nto hide it, to cover it up."},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"And so when you feel shame,\nwhen you feel defective,"},"775":{"dur":5,"text":"the only thing you can do is\nstay at home, cover up, lie, disappear."},"781":{"dur":5,"text":"And when you feel guilty, you can repair\nyour wrong-doing or your bad action"},"786":{"dur":3,"text":"because you feel responsible\nfor what you've done."},"790":{"dur":4,"text":"But even then, guilt is an uncomfortable\nself-conscious emotion."},"794":{"dur":5,"text":"Many people feel responsible\nfor having created a life"},"799":{"dur":4,"text":"in which they feel they've made\nthe decisions that led to this or that."},"804":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, I'm going to say a few things\nabout responsibility in a moment,"},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"but let me just touch\non envy and jealousy."},"812":{"dur":4,"text":"Envy is the motivation to destroy\nor attack what someone else has"},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"because you don't feel\nyou can get it for yourself."},"819":{"dur":4,"text":"And jealousy is the desire\nto compete with someone else"},"824":{"dur":2,"text":"who has what you want\nbecause you do feel you could get it."},"827":{"dur":3,"text":"So envy and jealousy,\nin these self-conscious emotions,"},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"motivate very different things,"},"832":{"dur":3,"text":"but in both cases they make us restless."},"836":{"dur":4,"text":"Envy makes us restless in terms\nof attacking what someone else has,"},"840":{"dur":4,"text":"like putting it down,\nbelittling it, minimalizing it,"},"844":{"dur":4,"text":"or even sometimes\nattacking the other person outright."},"849":{"dur":5,"text":"And jealousy, to compete with others,\nand to see ourselves, really, always"},"854":{"dur":5,"text":"as not having enough, somehow, to succeed."},"860":{"dur":4,"text":"So, these self-conscious emotions\nmotivate us in a way"},"864":{"dur":4,"text":"that make us feel like we can control\nour lives and our decision-making,"},"869":{"dur":2,"text":"and that we should manage everything."},"872":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, of course, we are\nresponsible for our actions,"},"876":{"dur":2,"text":"and we're responsible for our speech,"},"878":{"dur":4,"text":"but we are not responsible\nfor all the contingencies in our lives"},"883":{"dur":3,"text":"and that sort of mysterious universe"},"886":{"dur":4,"text":"that, actually, is always\na point of fascination."},"891":{"dur":5,"text":"So, what to do\nin order to arrive at a point"},"897":{"dur":5,"text":"where you can feel genuine happiness\non a moment-to-moment basis"},"902":{"dur":3,"text":"without years of sitting meditation,"},"905":{"dur":3,"text":"without having a direct\nexperience of the no-self:"},"909":{"dur":4,"text":"how can you shift your view a little bit\nand come back to a point of view"},"914":{"dur":2,"text":"that I think people\nhave had traditionally?"},"917":{"dur":3,"text":"So first, I would recommend\nthat you experiment,"},"920":{"dur":4,"text":"and experiment with these three things\nthat I've put up on the board."},"925":{"dur":3,"text":"The first one is to go back\nto that Chinese painting"},"928":{"dur":4,"text":"and imagine that you are tiny\nand the world is large."},"933":{"dur":3,"text":"And at any moment that you feel bored,"},"936":{"dur":2,"text":"that you feel bored with yourself,"},"939":{"dur":4,"text":"stop, and be in contact\nwith the world in a simple way:"},"943":{"dur":1,"text":"feel the air on your face;"},"944":{"dur":1,"text":"look at the light in the room;"},"946":{"dur":2,"text":"see the colors, they're not personal."},"949":{"dur":2,"text":"But you can be in contact with the world"},"951":{"dur":3,"text":"in a very simple\nand fascinating way quickly,"},"955":{"dur":3,"text":"and it will change,\nit will shift your point of view."},"959":{"dur":4,"text":"Second, spend a day or two or three\nwithout looking in a mirror."},"964":{"dur":3,"text":"We are obsessed with the way\nwe look in this period of time."},"968":{"dur":2,"text":"People did not live\nwith mirrors or photographs"},"970":{"dur":3,"text":"or anything like this,\ncertainly not Facebook,"},"973":{"dur":2,"text":"for eons of time,"},"976":{"dur":3,"text":"and so they weren't removed\nfrom their experience"},"980":{"dur":1,"text":"by looking at themselves."},"982":{"dur":3,"text":"Thirdly, become engaged\nin your immediate world."},"986":{"dur":1,"text":"People often talk about,"},"987":{"dur":3,"text":"and many wonderful things\nhave been said here today,"},"991":{"dur":2,"text":"about how to help in the world out there."},"994":{"dur":3,"text":"But also look at the immediate environment"},"997":{"dur":3,"text":"in which you are arising,\nmoment to moment."},"1001":{"dur":3,"text":"That is, the room that you're in\nwhen you walk through a door,"},"1005":{"dur":4,"text":"when you look up from\nwhat you're focusing on within yourself,"},"1009":{"dur":4,"text":"look up and see if someone needs help,\nif someone needs a smile,"},"1014":{"dur":2,"text":"if a door needs to be opened."},"1016":{"dur":5,"text":"I guarantee, if you do that, you will find\nthat the world is reaching out to you"},"1022":{"dur":1,"text":"all of the time."},"1023":{"dur":2,"text":"And so if you put\nthese three things together,"},"1026":{"dur":6,"text":"and you recognize how fascinating\nthis world is, always,"},"1032":{"dur":3,"text":"and you stop looking\nat yourself in the mirror,"},"1036":{"dur":4,"text":"and you open yourself to the way\nthat the world is reaching out to you,"},"1041":{"dur":4,"text":"happiness is guaranteed almost 24\/7."},"1046":{"dur":3,"text":"Thank you very much,\nI hope that you find it,"},"1049":{"dur":2,"text":"and I wish you blessings."},"1051":{"dur":2,"text":"(Applause)"}}
