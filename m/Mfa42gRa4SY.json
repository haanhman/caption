design."},"32":{"dur":5,"text":"We're also fortunate to have with\nus Julio Grata and Craig Sapp."},"37":{"dur":4,"text":"They wrote some of the software\nthat we're going to spotlight in"},"41":{"dur":1,"text":"the presentation today."},"44":{"dur":3,"text":"So we're gonna talk about a couple\nof courses that the vice provost for"},"47":{"dur":4,"text":"teaching and learning has put out through\nits online portal Stanford Online."},"53":{"dur":4,"text":"The first course is Defining\nthe String Quartet: Haydn."},"58":{"dur":7,"text":"This is a self paced MOOC that\njust came out about a month ago."},"66":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a collaboration\nbetween professor of music,"},"69":{"dur":5,"text":"Stephen Hinton and the ensemble in\nresidence, the St Lawrence String Quartet."},"76":{"dur":5,"text":"So this course features conversations\nbetween Stephen and the Quartet."},"81":{"dur":3,"text":"Stephen talks about the genre\nof the string quartet and"},"85":{"dur":2,"text":"how it was developed by Haydn."},"88":{"dur":3,"text":"He might talk about a certain form or\ngesture."},"91":{"dur":1,"text":"The quartet would play it,"},"93":{"dur":4,"text":"it was beautifully shot by\nour team back here actually."},"98":{"dur":3,"text":"They did a great job in our\nbeautiful new Bing Concert Hall."},"101":{"dur":5,"text":"And this course featured\na challenge which many MOOCs"},"106":{"dur":4,"text":"present to instructional\ndesigners which is,"},"111":{"dur":6,"text":"how do you present to a very\nbroad audience using this medium."},"117":{"dur":3,"text":"So Stephen wanted to really be able\nto dig into the meat of the matter."},"121":{"dur":3,"text":"He wanted to be able to\nget into the analysis,"},"124":{"dur":2,"text":"to talk deeply about the history."},"127":{"dur":3,"text":"But he also didn't want to alienate\nlearners who didn't know how to"},"130":{"dur":4,"text":"read music, who had no experience\nwhatsoever with music."},"136":{"dur":2,"text":"So we had a number of different ideas for"},"139":{"dur":4,"text":"how to tackle this challenge which\nI'm going to present to you."},"143":{"dur":4,"text":"The first one was to use layered content."},"148":{"dur":4,"text":"So some of the content in the course\nis quite advanced, some of it is"},"153":{"dur":4,"text":"fairly basic, and so there's a little\nbit of something there for everybody."},"157":{"dur":5,"text":"There are also two types of statement of\naccomplishment that students can earn."},"163":{"dur":3,"text":"There's a basic statement\nof accomplishment and"},"166":{"dur":2,"text":"there's an advanced\nstatement of accomplishment."},"168":{"dur":5,"text":"Corresponding to these two statements,\nthere are two different types of problems"},"174":{"dur":7,"text":"that we marked with a single eighth\nnote and a double eighth note."},"181":{"dur":4,"text":"So if you do only the single eighth note\nproblems, you can earn a basic statement."},"185":{"dur":5,"text":"And if you do the double eighth note\nproblems, you can earn the advanced one."},"190":{"dur":4,"text":"We wanted to make sure though,\neven still that students who"},"195":{"dur":5,"text":"didn't know how to read music could\naccess as much of the course as possible."},"200":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we actually have a lot of\nmessaging in the course encouraging"},"204":{"dur":2,"text":"them to try the double\neighth note problems"},"206":{"dur":4,"text":"even if they don't read music because\na lot of them actually are accessible, and"},"210":{"dur":3,"text":"we also have some other\nsoftware solutions for this."},"216":{"dur":4,"text":"So Solution #2 is dynamic scores or\ninteractive scores."},"223":{"dur":4,"text":"So you're all familiar with\nthe Open edX platform, and you"},"227":{"dur":4,"text":"know how it has the scrolling captions on\nthe side that highlight what's being said."},"232":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, Craig here designed a platform\nthat does the same thing, but for music."},"237":{"dur":3,"text":"So you've got the music playing and\nthere's a scrolling score and"},"240":{"dur":2,"text":"it highlights the notes\nthat are being played."},"243":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm going to show you a little clip."},"245":{"dur":5,"text":"Let's see, uh-oh,"},"251":{"dur":3,"text":"there we go."},"254":{"dur":4,"text":"[MUSIC]"},"263":{"dur":5,"text":"So you can see there that as a note is\nplayed, it gets highlighted in red."},"269":{"dur":3,"text":"Much like on the Open edX platform,"},"273":{"dur":3,"text":"you can also click on a specific note and\nhave it jump there."},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"So let me show you how that works."},"279":{"dur":1,"text":"You'll see the mouse click in a minute."},"281":{"dur":10,"text":"[MUSIC]"},"292":{"dur":5,"text":"Now there've already been some comments\nin the discussion forum about this tool."},"298":{"dur":3,"text":"People are saying, hey, this is pretty\nnifty, and I don't know how to read music"},"302":{"dur":3,"text":"but I actually feel like I get\na sense now of what those dots and"},"305":{"dur":5,"text":"lines mean, based on watching\nthe score as I listened to the music."},"311":{"dur":3,"text":"And now since we have some developers in\nthe audience, I thought it would be nice"},"314":{"dur":4,"text":"to have Craig come up on stage and tell\nyou a little bit about how he did this."},"319":{"dur":4,"text":"So Craig is a consulting assistant\nprofessor in the Center for"},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"Computer Assisted Research and\nthe Humanities."},"326":{"dur":2,"text":">> Yeah.\nSo I'll just give a very brief overview"},"328":{"dur":2,"text":"and if people wanna have more\ndetail afterwards they can come and"},"331":{"dur":1,"text":"ask me questions."},"332":{"dur":3,"text":"So here's kind of the basic\noverview of how it works."},"336":{"dur":5,"text":"So I work with HTML5 audio and\nvideo interface with a little"},"341":{"dur":4,"text":"loop that runs whenever you\nstart playing the video and"},"346":{"dur":5,"text":"then it keeps track of kind of\na table between the score time and"},"351":{"dur":3,"text":"the physical time and the performance."},"355":{"dur":5,"text":"And then, depending on what time,\nif it's time for something to happen,"},"361":{"dur":5,"text":"like turning on our note off in\nthe notation, it'll go to the <svg> and"},"367":{"dur":5,"text":"put in little class tags to turn things\non or remove them to turn them off."},"372":{"dur":4,"text":"So the core of the system is the alignment\nbetween the audio and the notation."},"377":{"dur":7,"text":"So I do analysis on performance\nanalysis of piano pieces."},"385":{"dur":4,"text":"And so\nI've written some audio mark up tools for"},"389":{"dur":3,"text":"a program called Sonic Visualizer,\nwhich is an annotation tool for audio."},"393":{"dur":5,"text":"There's also been, I've seen a few online\nweb interfaces that do similar things,"},"399":{"dur":4,"text":"but this is more for scientific research,\nso I can get very accurately alignment."},"406":{"dur":5,"text":"So what I do is I basically have,\nthe orange thing is the audio wave form."},"411":{"dur":2,"text":"The purple vertical lines\nare where I'm putting my marks."},"414":{"dur":3,"text":"And then I label which measure and\nwhich beat."},"418":{"dur":5,"text":"And then this black kind of little curve\nunderneath is a marker for where note"},"423":{"dur":4,"text":"onsets are occurring so I can kind of see\nwhere these things are occurring visually."},"427":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's not very obvious in\nthe orange waveform, and then I have"},"430":{"dur":4,"text":"a form of spectrogram underneath that\nalso helps me decide on the alignment."},"436":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's kind of a semi-automated process."},"438":{"dur":4,"text":"So there are ways of doing it fully\nautomated, but you'll get errors and for"},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"visual and audio alignment you\ndon't need to be too accurate."},"446":{"dur":4,"text":"But in general I work on more\nhighly accurate alignment for"},"450":{"dur":1,"text":"performance analysis."},"453":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is the kinda map between"},"457":{"dur":5,"text":"time in the score which is the pinkish\ncolor to time in the recording in red."},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"And so this is kind of an example\nof how the score is marked up."},"465":{"dur":3,"text":"So what I do is in the score I just\ndo the number of quarter notes since"},"469":{"dur":4,"text":"the beginning of the piece, so it's\njust the continuous sequence of numbers."},"473":{"dur":3,"text":"It just counts how many quarter\nnote since beginning in the piece."},"477":{"dur":0,"text":"So every note And"},"478":{"dur":3,"text":"the score gets labeled with a time\nstamp in terms of quarter notes."},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"So I don't put real time in there."},"484":{"dur":4,"text":"That's cut in the table of the time map."},"489":{"dur":8,"text":"So let me see then in the score\nI prepare it, it's an SVG image."},"497":{"dur":5,"text":"And for every graphical objects that I\nneed to highlight I wrap it in a G element"},"503":{"dur":4,"text":"which has in this case note on dash 95 and\nnote on 96."},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"That means turn on the note\nthat quarter note 96 and"},"510":{"dur":4,"text":"turn it off at, I mean turn it\non at 95 and turn it off at 96."},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"So then what happens, so the big, so"},"517":{"dur":5,"text":"all I have to do when I'm performing\nis I put a little on tag and"},"523":{"dur":4,"text":"I have a css style for the SVG,\nwhich turns it red if it has the on class."},"528":{"dur":6,"text":"When it's time to turn off, I just remove\nthe on tag and it goes back to black."},"536":{"dur":3,"text":"Some I'm kind of working on generalizing\nthe software that's used in the class."},"540":{"dur":4,"text":"At the moment it only works on\nHTML 5 elements of audio and"},"544":{"dur":5,"text":"video but eventually I want to also do\nit for YouTube which is more complicated"},"550":{"dur":4,"text":"process because I can't access the time\nas fast as I can with audio element."},"556":{"dur":4,"text":"And some working eventually\nto have a not so"},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"great working version of\nthe software up online already."},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you're interested,\nI can give you updates, or"},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"you can help me with it in the future."},"568":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's my part of the presentation."},"571":{"dur":5,"text":"[APPLAUSE]\n>> And if you have questions for Craig,"},"577":{"dur":7,"text":"there will be some time for\nQ and A at the end of this."},"584":{"dur":5,"text":"There's one more solution that we\nstumbled upon for the Haydn course."},"591":{"dur":4,"text":"Really something that people use\nall the time, learning by doing."},"596":{"dur":4,"text":"We still wanted students to have more\nopportunities to learn about reading"},"601":{"dur":5,"text":"music without adding more videos,\nand lectures and readings."},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"So we just created a series of problems."},"608":{"dur":3,"text":"Very simple problems where\nthe student is asked,"},"612":{"dur":4,"text":"they're given a score and they're asked to\nclick on the highest pitch for example."},"617":{"dur":5,"text":"They're not instructed what these\npitch things are or notes are,"},"622":{"dur":4,"text":"what are these dots and lines,\nbut they are given an audio clip."},"627":{"dur":3,"text":"[MUSIC]"},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"Which corresponds to\nthe notes that they see."},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"And if they need extra\nhelp there's a hint button"},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"which tells them that the ovals\ncorrespond to pitches."},"648":{"dur":6,"text":"Further, we have a piano gadget\nwhich we've included in the course."},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"Now this is a piano\nthat students can play."},"658":{"dur":3,"text":"When they click on a note\nthey will hear a pitch and"},"662":{"dur":4,"text":"they will also see the corresponding\nnote on the staff."},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'll show you what\nthat looks like as well."},"671":{"dur":10,"text":"[MUSIC]"},"683":{"dur":4,"text":"So this kinda lets the student\nexperiment and figure out for"},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"themselves what these notes mean."},"690":{"dur":5,"text":"Now we have Julio here to tell us a little\nbit about how he wrote the code for"},"696":{"dur":0,"text":"this piano."},"697":{"dur":7,"text":">> So this is actually a fairly simple, it\nseems really complicated but really isn't."},"705":{"dur":5,"text":"It was built as part of a hack-a-thon that\nwe were doing when js input first came out"},"710":{"dur":4,"text":"on edX which is actually quite a bit long\ntime ago, one and a half years now but,"},"715":{"dur":3,"text":"and so, we were just trying to play\nwith what js input could do and so"},"719":{"dur":4,"text":"I did this and another even simpler\none but this is really all it is."},"723":{"dur":4,"text":"It's just joining three\ndifferent JavaScript"},"727":{"dur":4,"text":"libraries Raphael is just SVG\nas it says there canvas drawing."},"732":{"dur":4,"text":"Vex flow is to draw the little\nstaff with the note depending on"},"737":{"dur":1,"text":"what input you give it and"},"739":{"dur":5,"text":"qwerty Hancock is an incredibly well-named\nlittle to the piano is actually that one."},"744":{"dur":6,"text":"And that just uses the JavaScript\naudio library to generate audio waves."},"751":{"dur":3,"text":"So in this case I think I'm using\na saw tooth wave for those things."},"755":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah and\nthat's where the code is available there."},"757":{"dur":2,"text":"Including a bunch of other\nstuff from us for js inputs."},"760":{"dur":4,"text":"[APPLAUSE]\n>> Great so"},"765":{"dur":6,"text":"that's it for Hyden."},"771":{"dur":4,"text":"Now we have another course that had\na strange notation that students"},"776":{"dur":5,"text":"needed to learn how to translate\ninto something they can understand."},"781":{"dur":6,"text":"And we have Kenny to talk to us\nabout taking deeper, thank you."},"791":{"dur":8,"text":">> Okay, so Digging Deeper is a sequence\nof courses on medieval manuscripts."},"799":{"dur":4,"text":"It was created by Professor Elaine\nTreharne at Stanford collaborating with"},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"librarians at\nCambridge University Library and"},"808":{"dur":3,"text":"Stanford University Library and\nalso faculty at Cambridge."},"811":{"dur":5,"text":"And the motivation for\nthis course is that a lot of"},"816":{"dur":3,"text":"manuscript material is out there in\nsome form, much of this being digitized."},"820":{"dur":5,"text":"People can see medieval manuscripts but\nthey have no way to dig deeper"},"825":{"dur":3,"text":"as it were to find out what\nthe heck this stuff actually means."},"829":{"dur":4,"text":"And the professor is very\ninvested in opening access."},"834":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean manuscripts are our best\nwindow into the medieval world,"},"837":{"dur":2,"text":"this thousand year period of history."},"839":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a lot that you can get but"},"842":{"dur":3,"text":"you need to be able to get into\nthe manuscripts a little bit."},"845":{"dur":2,"text":"So how do you do that?"},"848":{"dur":5,"text":"The main challenge is to teach close\nanalysis of medieval handwriting and"},"854":{"dur":7,"text":"that is not a trivial challenge in\nan online environment or anywhere."},"861":{"dur":2,"text":"This medieval handwriting\nis actually not bad."},"866":{"dur":3,"text":"This is actually English,\nthis is Latin, but this is English, but"},"869":{"dur":4,"text":"it's really hard to read and\nin order for learners"},"874":{"dur":4,"text":"to make substantial progress in this,\nthey have to get into this in some way."},"880":{"dur":5,"text":"So what to do,\nthe first solution is the sort of easy or"},"885":{"dur":5,"text":"basic solution, which is to give people\na deep background on Medieval Culture."},"891":{"dur":4,"text":"And we did this basically with videos and\nmultiple choice assessments."},"896":{"dur":6,"text":"So basically, Elaine would talk about\nwhere manuscripts were produced, why"},"902":{"dur":4,"text":"they were produced, how a scholar begins\nto look at them, the materials used."},"907":{"dur":1,"text":"So there be a video and"},"908":{"dur":4,"text":"then some multiple choice to show that\nyou have paid attention to the video."},"913":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can get a certain\ndistance with that."},"917":{"dur":4,"text":"Here is a manuscript,\nI know nothing about it."},"921":{"dur":5,"text":"But I know what paper looks like, papyrus\nlooks like and what parchment looks like"},"926":{"dur":3,"text":"and I know that these are associate\nwith particular periods,"},"929":{"dur":5,"text":"with specific levels of affluence,\nwith specific historical events."},"934":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, so I can get a little\nbit further into these texts."},"938":{"dur":7,"text":"But the difficult problem remains\nthat you have to tackle paleography,"},"945":{"dur":6,"text":"the study of handwriting, and\nagain this is a serious Hurdle."},"952":{"dur":6,"text":"Traditionally you'll get a book like this,\nIntroduction to Manuscripts Studies."},"958":{"dur":5,"text":"And you'll sit with a world expert in\nspecial collections for about five"},"963":{"dur":6,"text":"years going through manuscripts and\ntranscribing them with paper and pencil."},"969":{"dur":5,"text":"So that's a little hard\nto replicate in a MOOC."},"975":{"dur":4,"text":"So what we did was,\nElaine made a video in which she"},"980":{"dur":5,"text":"basically had a text from\nspecial collections, a pencil,"},"985":{"dur":6,"text":"and she showed this is how medievalist\nactually learned to do what they do."},"992":{"dur":2,"text":"They sit down,\nthey look at a manuscript and"},"995":{"dur":4,"text":"they transcribe it by a set of rules\nthat medievalists have come up with."},"999":{"dur":5,"text":"And Elaine said,\nwe have to make this work online."},"1004":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'm gonna confess."},"1006":{"dur":3,"text":"I think this is the best thing that came\nout of this course in a lot of ways."},"1011":{"dur":4,"text":"My response to the instructional\ndesigner was, that's a terrible idea."},"1015":{"dur":5,"text":"We shouldn't even touch this because,\nfirst of all,"},"1021":{"dur":2,"text":"we don't have really\na good way to assess this."},"1023":{"dur":3,"text":"We didn't come up with\na way that we'd check"},"1027":{"dur":2,"text":"that you were doing this\nin any way correctly."},"1030":{"dur":3,"text":"Also, I said this all very\npolitely obviously, but"},"1034":{"dur":2,"text":"I said,\nwhy would anyone want to do that anymore?"},"1036":{"dur":2,"text":"This is from an age when people had to,"},"1039":{"dur":4,"text":"you go to the library at York and\nthe only way that other medievalists"},"1044":{"dur":4,"text":"are gonna know what you thought is you\ntranscribe it correctly with your pencil."},"1049":{"dur":2,"text":"But you can take a picture\nwith your iPhone now."},"1051":{"dur":4,"text":"You don't need to do this anymore and\nElaine said, if you don't learn this,"},"1056":{"dur":2,"text":"you'll never learn what\nyou're looking at at all."},"1059":{"dur":0,"text":"So it's like, okay."},"1060":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, we better do it."},"1062":{"dur":3,"text":"So the first version of this was\nwe have a page of a manuscript for"},"1066":{"dur":4,"text":"people to look at, and we have a text box,\nand we give them certain rules for"},"1071":{"dur":2,"text":"transcribing what they see."},"1073":{"dur":6,"text":"So it's very imperfect in that many, many,\nmany, many, many medieval manuscripts"},"1080":{"dur":5,"text":"contain letters that no longer exist and\npunctuation that no longer exists."},"1087":{"dur":4,"text":"Also, there are things that you can do\non paper more easily, like underline,"},"1091":{"dur":2,"text":"that we didn't have\na good option with here."},"1094":{"dur":2,"text":"So we had good responses from people."},"1096":{"dur":3,"text":"This is what it looks like when\nsomebody actually puts something in and"},"1100":{"dur":2,"text":"this is the attempt to replicate it."},"1102":{"dur":4,"text":"We could give a special character bank\nhere for people to copy and paste but"},"1107":{"dur":4,"text":"still we felt like this was a pretty\nimperfect way of tackling the problem and"},"1111":{"dur":4,"text":"we wanted to bring people a lot closer to\nwhat the manuscripts were actually saying."},"1116":{"dur":5,"text":"And we could only do that with\nthe help of Julio, again."},"1121":{"dur":5,"text":">> All right, so I found online\nthat there's actually an initiative"},"1127":{"dur":7,"text":"by medievalists, something called MUFI, or\nM-U-F-I, Medieval Unicode Font Initiative."},"1135":{"dur":5,"text":"So there's this bank of Unicode\ncharacters that are sort of left open for"},"1140":{"dur":1,"text":"people to play with and"},"1141":{"dur":6,"text":"do other things with that really don't\nhave anything specific to be used for."},"1147":{"dur":4,"text":"And so there are special fonts, including\none that I ended up using for this,"},"1152":{"dur":3,"text":"which I guess is not on this screen but\nyou'll see it in the next slide."},"1155":{"dur":3,"text":"That actually used those\nUnicode characters and"},"1159":{"dur":3,"text":"mapped them to specific\nmedieval characters."},"1162":{"dur":5,"text":"And so all I ended up doing was basically\nbuilding a little mini text editor,"},"1168":{"dur":3,"text":"kind of, using the same\nfunctions as Google Docs uses."},"1172":{"dur":4,"text":"Just JavaScript functions that detect\nkeystrokes for bolding and underlining,"},"1176":{"dur":1,"text":"and things like that."},"1178":{"dur":7,"text":"And also just insert characters and change\nsort of the color and size of characters."},"1186":{"dur":5,"text":"So a lot of it I think was actually\nbuilt on the X block hackathon."},"1193":{"dur":6,"text":"Yeah, let me know if anybody needs or\nwants more information on how these work."},"1199":{"dur":1,"text":">> Go hackathons!"},"1200":{"dur":4,"text":"[LAUGH] Some pretty good\nstuff comes out of those."},"1205":{"dur":4,"text":"what we got to implement in the second\ncourse was a new transcription tool."},"1210":{"dur":5,"text":"And so you see again,\nwe have a page of medieval manuscript and"},"1216":{"dur":3,"text":"down here is where you can input stuff."},"1220":{"dur":3,"text":"And magically,\nthis meaning from the humanities,"},"1223":{"dur":4,"text":"magically you now have all these\ncharacters that you didn't have before and"},"1228":{"dur":4,"text":"you've maybe never seen\nrepresented on a computer screen."},"1232":{"dur":0,"text":"This is terrific."},"1233":{"dur":3,"text":"Now you can put any of them in."},"1237":{"dur":3,"text":"So you have like all these\nweirdo bits of punctuation,"},"1240":{"dur":3,"text":"you have that which is the T-H sound,\nand also to represent,"},"1244":{"dur":3,"text":"it's called lideo or\nnotabilis, like a big letter."},"1247":{"dur":2,"text":"You can make the letter big."},"1250":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can make it colored,\nthe colors were significant too."},"1253":{"dur":4,"text":"So we thought that this was a huge\nwin when we had a really good"},"1258":{"dur":4,"text":"reaction from the community\naround the course about this."},"1265":{"dur":5,"text":"And we also just had a lot of\nsuccess with the palaeography"},"1270":{"dur":4,"text":"exercises even though they\nwere really difficult."},"1275":{"dur":5,"text":"So here, orange and\nyellow are course one and"},"1280":{"dur":4,"text":"green and brown are course two."},"1285":{"dur":1,"text":"There's the usual sort of big drop-off,"},"1287":{"dur":4,"text":"but the overall attrition\nwe had was pretty good."},"1291":{"dur":2,"text":"Completion rates were around 25% for\nboth courses."},"1294":{"dur":5,"text":"And what was really significant\nto me was that orange, here,"},"1300":{"dur":6,"text":"this unit completion, is the bread and\nbutter part of the course."},"1306":{"dur":1,"text":"It's the stable part of the course."},"1307":{"dur":2,"text":"It's the videos with\nthe main materials and"},"1309":{"dur":3,"text":"the multiple choice quizzes\nwhich were pretty easy."},"1314":{"dur":3,"text":"And yellow is the paleography exercises."},"1317":{"dur":4,"text":"So in Course 1, you can see that\nafter the first week, more people"},"1322":{"dur":4,"text":"are doing the paleography exercises than\nare actually just watching the videos and"},"1326":{"dur":4,"text":"doing the multiple choice, than\nare interacting with the core content."},"1331":{"dur":4,"text":"So the much harder part of this is\nwhat people were more drawn to."},"1335":{"dur":5,"text":"And similarly in course two, this is where\nwe implemented the new paleography tool."},"1343":{"dur":4,"text":"The paleography tool became
