that,"},"62":{"dur":1,"text":"it wouldn't help society,"},"64":{"dur":2,"text":"so in the end, it wouldn't\nreally be that fulfilling."},"68":{"dur":1,"text":"I was left with the question,"},"70":{"dur":2,"text":"\"How could I choose a fulfilling career?\""},"72":{"dur":3,"text":"And, maybe many of you\nhave asked yourself the same question."},"76":{"dur":1,"text":"I thought about this question,"},"77":{"dur":3,"text":"I realized I didn't even know\nhow to go about choosing a career,"},"80":{"dur":3,"text":"and I, you know, read books,\nI went to careers

of, delay the decision\nby a few years."},"101":{"dur":2,"text":"Instead of actually settling on a career,"},"103":{"dur":3,"text":"I founded an organization\ndedicated to researching the

career?\""},"148":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, it's true that one\nof the main things we discovered"},"151":{"dur":2,"text":"is that we have a lot to learn."},"154":{"dur":3,"text":"Choosing a career is a complex problem\nand not enough serious research"},"158":{"dur":2,"text":"has been done into how best to do it."},"161":{"dur":1,"text":"But we have spent the last three years"},"163":{"dur":3,"text":"doing research with academics\nof University of Oxford,"},"166":{"dur":1,"text":"and most importantly,"},"167":{"dur":3,"text":"we've coached hundreds of people\non how to make real career decisions."},"172":{"dur":3,"text":"All this research and thinking\nhas led us to the conclusion"},"175":{"dur":3,"text":"that careers advice today\nfocuses on the wrong thing."},"181":{"dur":1,"text":"Throughout most of history"},"182":{"dur":2,"text":"people basically did\nwhat their parents did."},"185":{"dur":3,"text":"Some people in the 1980s thought,"},"189":{"dur":1,"text":"\"The greed is good,\""},"190":{"dur":2,"text":"and they focused on making money."},"192":{"dur":3,"text":"But our generation grew up\nwith some different careers advice,"},"195":{"dur":3,"text":"and that's that you should\nfollow your passion."},"199":{"dur":2,"text":"You can see that use of this phrase"},"201":{"dur":3,"text":"increased dramatically\nfrom the mid-nineties."},"205":{"dur":3,"text":"But today I think need to move\nbeyond \"Follow your passion,\""},"208":{"dur":2,"text":"as the career advice to focus on,"},"211":{"dur":3,"text":"and instead of asking\nwhat our own interests and passions are,"},"215":{"dur":1,"text":"we should be focusing much more"},"217":{"dur":3,"text":"on what we can do for other people,\nand to make the world a better place."},"222":{"dur":2,"text":"Ok, so let's go back to my decision,"},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"how would \"follow your passion\"\napply to me?"},"227":{"dur":3,"text":"I think what \"Follow your passion\"\ntells you to do is three things:"},"230":{"dur":3,"text":"the first is to identify\nyour greatest interests;"},"234":{"dur":4,"text":"second, find careers\nthat match those interests;"},"238":{"dur":2,"text":"thirdly, pursue those careers,\nno matter what."},"241":{"dur":1,"text":"Finding a fulfilling career"},"242":{"dur":3,"text":"is just a matter of having the courage\nto pursue your passion."},"247":{"dur":1,"text":"In my case,"},"248":{"dur":3,"text":"I was interested in martial arts\nand philosophy, remember?"},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"So, which career should I pick?"},"254":{"dur":1,"text":"Any ideas?"},"257":{"dur":3,"text":"I should obviously become a Shaolin monk -"},"260":{"dur":2,"text":"Buddhism and martial arts, together."},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"What's the theory behind this advice?"},"268":{"dur":1,"text":"You get passion match,"},"269":{"dur":2,"text":"then you really enjoy your work,\nyou're really motivated,"},"272":{"dur":2,"text":"so you're more likely to be successful,"},"274":{"dur":3,"text":"and if you are successful\ndoing something you're passionate about,"},"277":{"dur":2,"text":"then you have a fulfilling career."},"280":{"dur":1,"text":"And, spelled out like that,"},"282":{"dur":3,"text":"this really does sound\nlike pretty reasonable advice, right?"},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"I can maybe get behind that."},"289":{"dur":3,"text":"But let's just think about it\nin a bit more depth."},"293":{"dur":4,"text":"Turns out if you follow your passion,\nyou're probably going to fail."},"299":{"dur":1,"text":"Why do I say that?"},"300":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's look at the data."},"303":{"dur":3,"text":"A survey of 500 Canadian students\nfound that their greatest passions"},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"were ice-hockey and dance."},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"Ninety percent of them were passionate"},"312":{"dur":3,"text":"about sports, arts,\nmusic, something like that."},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"But if we look at census data we can see"},"319":{"dur":4,"text":"that only three percent of jobs\nare in art, sport, and music."},"323":{"dur":1,"text":"So it just has to be the case"},"325":{"dur":3,"text":"that even if only one in ten people\nfollowed their passion,"},"328":{"dur":3,"text":"still, the majority would\nfail to be successful."},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"So this first step just doesn't work."},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"I think the second step\nis also not reliable."},"339":{"dur":4,"text":"In that, even if you match\nyour passion with your work,"},"344":{"dur":1,"text":"and you're successful,"},"345":{"dur":3,"text":"you can stlll quite easily fail\nto have a fulfilling career,"},"348":{"dur":3,"text":"that's because you might not\nfind the work meaningful."},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"This was a bit like me\ndeciding not to go into finance,"},"354":{"dur":1,"text":"I thought, well, I was interested in it,"},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"maybe I could be successful\nbut I wouldn't make a difference,"},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"maybe it would still end up\nnot being fulfilling,"},"362":{"dur":3,"text":"so I think the second step\ndoesn't work either."},"365":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, at this point you might be thinking,"},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Sure, passion\nisn't the only thing that matters,"},"371":{"dur":3,"text":"if I follow my passion,\nit doesn't guarantee that I'll succeed,"},"375":{"dur":3,"text":"but maybe at least makes me\nmore likely to succeed,"},"379":{"dur":1,"text":"and to have a fulfilling career.\""},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"As a career advice,\nthis is the best we can do."},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"But I think that is wrong as well."},"386":{"dur":4,"text":"Picture to yourself now,\nthe most assertive person you know,"},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"who' s really passionate\nabout selling and persuading,"},"394":{"dur":2,"text":"and they're really extroverted."},"396":{"dur":1,"text":"Surely someone like that should go"},"398":{"dur":5,"text":"and become an advertising\naccounts manager, like in Mad Men,"},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"or they should become a car salesman,\nor something like that,"},"406":{"dur":4,"text":"something which involves selling,\nbeing extroverted, and talking to people."},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, it turns out that would\nbe a really bad decision:"},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"analysis of a determined study showed"},"415":{"dur":4,"text":"that really passionate sales people\nreally persuasive, assertive types"},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"who went into those kinds of sales jobs"},"422":{"dur":4,"text":"actually ended up more likely\nto burn out and in fact died younger"},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"than normal people who take those jobs."},"429":{"dur":3,"text":"Following their passion\nactually made them more likely to die."},"432":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"436":{"dur":3,"text":"And more generally, researchers have tried\nto show for decades"},"439":{"dur":4,"text":"that there's a strong relationship\nbetween interest match"},"443":{"dur":4,"text":"and how successful and happy\npeople end up in their work,"},"448":{"dur":3,"text":"but so far, they failed to show\na strong connection between the two."},"452":{"dur":3,"text":"I think this isn't because your interests\njust don't matter,"},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"but it's just that when it comes\nto real career decisions,"},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"your interests are just not\na decisive factor,"},"461":{"dur":1,"text":"other things matter much more,"},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"like what your skills are,\nand what your mindset is."},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"Indeed, we think our interests matter\na lot more than they do,"},"470":{"dur":3,"text":"because we really underestimate\nhow much they change:"},"473":{"dur":5,"text":"just think about your own interests\nfive or ten years ago,"},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"and how different they are from today."},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, back then,\nyou're probably this tall,"},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"and you're probably interested\nin completely different things."},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"Five or ten years time,"},"488":{"dur":3,"text":"you will be interested\nin totally different things again."},"492":{"dur":3,"text":"All this means that your present interests"},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"are just not a solid basis\non which to chose a career."},"499":{"dur":3,"text":"So, if we're not going to focus\non interests,"},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"what should we focus on?"},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're not just going\nto follow your passion,"},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"what should you do instead?"},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"If I had to sum up careers advice\nas a single slogan,"},"512":{"dur":3,"text":"here's what I would choose:\n\"Do what's valuable.\""},"518":{"dur":1,"text":"By this I mean"},"520":{"dur":3,"text":"focus on getting good at something\nthat genuinely helps others,"},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"and makes the world a better place."},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"That's the secret to a fulfilling career."},"532":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, obviously doing what's valuable\nis going to be better for the world,"},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"you're going to do more good like that,"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"but people have also thought for millennia"},"541":{"dur":3,"text":"that helping others is the secret\nto be personally fulfilled and happy."},"544":{"dur":2,"text":"I've just got a representative\ncouple of quotes here"},"547":{"dur":1,"text":"just read out the first one:"},"548":{"dur":3,"text":"\"A man true wealth\nis the good he does in this world.\""},"554":{"dur":4,"text":"Today we actually\nhave hard data to back this up."},"559":{"dur":4,"text":"Professor of Psychology Martin Seligman\nin his 2011 book: Flourish,"},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"aimed to sum up the last couple of decades\nof empirical research"},"567":{"dur":4,"text":"into what really causes people\nto be satisfied and happy in their lives."},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"And two of the key ingredients\nhe identifies"},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"just are doing what's valuable."},"576":{"dur":4,"text":"The first of these is achievement,\nor sometimes called mastery,"},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"and this means getting really\ngood at something,"},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"working hard and getting good\nat something."},"586":{"dur":3,"text":"The second is meaning,\nalso called purpose,"},"589":{"dur":3,"text":"and this means striving to do something\ngreater than just make yourself happy,"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"so it means making\nthe world a better place."},"595":{"dur":1,"text":"Put the two together,"},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"get good at something\nit makes the world a better place,"},"599":{"dur":1,"text":"do what's valuable."},"601":{"dur":4,"text":"I think, doing what's valuable has\nlots of other personal benefits as well."},"605":{"dur":1,"text":"For instance,"},"606":{"dur":4,"text":"even if you work in a charity,\nthe people who have the greatest impact,"},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"do the most valuable things,"},"612":{"dur":3,"text":"find it easier to raise fundings,\nand therefore pay their bills,"},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's important, too."},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"I have at least found\nin my own experience,"},"620":{"dur":3,"text":"if you focus on helping others,\nthen lots of people want you to succeed,"},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"so it's actually easier\nto be successful as an altruist"},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"compared to just being in it for yourself."},"630":{"dur":3,"text":"So, it now turns out that actually\nthe advice \"Follow your passion,\""},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"just gets things backwards."},"637":{"dur":3,"text":"Rather than start from what we happen\nto be passionate about now"},"640":{"dur":3,"text":"and then hope that success\nand a fulfilling career will follow,"},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"instead, it's much more true to say"},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"that we should focus\non doing what's valuable,"},"647":{"dur":3,"text":"and then that will lead to passion\nand a fulfilling career."},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"I've definitely found this\nin my own experience."},"655":{"dur":4,"text":"If when I was 16,\nyou had given me this careers test:"},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Would you like to give\ncareer guidance to people?\""},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"I'd have clicked the \"Hate it\" button."},"664":{"dur":1,"text":"I was pretty shy and into science,"},"666":{"dur":3,"text":"and the idea of giving careers advice\nto people was not appealing at all."},"670":{"dur":3,"text":"But now I spend all of my time\nthinking about careers advice,"},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"and am absolutely obsessed\nand fascinated by it."},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"Focusing on doing what's valuable"},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"has given me clear, concrete,\nmeaningful goals,"},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's made my life a lot better."},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"There's no more endless reflection"},"687":{"dur":3,"text":"on which of my interests\nrepresents my true calling,"},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"which doesn't exist anyway."},"694":{"dur":3,"text":"So, how can you actually do\nwhat's valuable in your careers,"},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"what practical steps should you follow?"},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"This is what we spend most of our time"},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"trying to work out at 80000Hours,"},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm just going to give you\na super-quick summary"},"706":{"dur":3,"text":"of three things we'd say that you can do."},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"The first of these is to explore,"},"712":{"dur":1,"text":"learn what you can about the world,"},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"and test yourself out in different things."},"716":{"dur":1,"text":"If you want to do what's valuable,"},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"you have to discover that\nout there in the world,"},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"you can't figure it out just by thinking\nabout your own interests."},"725":{"dur":4,"text":"Secondly, go after some skills,\nand try and get good at them,"},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"these are skills\nthat are really in demand,"},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"and can be used in many different areas."},"734":{"dur":5,"text":"I might pick computer programming\nas an example for the next decade."},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"This bit is where your passions\ndo come in,"},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"thinking about your passions does come in."},"744":{"dur":1,"text":"Because what you're passionate about now"},"746":{"dur":3,"text":"can give you clues about what you can get\nreally good at in the future,"},"750":{"dur":1,"text":"so that's worth thinking about,"},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"but they're not\nthe only thing that matters."},"754":{"dur":1,"text":"And then when you get those skills,"},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"go and find the biggest, \nmost pressing social problems you can,"},"760":{"dur":3,"text":"and apply your skills to solving them."},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"Don't just pick a problem\nthat is important,"},"765":{"dur":4,"text":"try and find one that's been unfairly\nneglected by other people,"},"770":{"dur":2,"text":"because that's where you'll have\nthe greatest impact."},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"And finally, don't think\nthat in order to do what's valuable,"},"776":{"dur":3,"text":"you have to become a doctor,\nand personally go to Africa,"},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"and help people with your own two hands."},"782":{"dur":1,"text":"Big social problems can be,"},"784":{"dur":5,"text":"and often are solved by research,\nby developing new technology,"},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"by spreading big ideas in the arts."},"793":{"dur":1,"text":"The key is to work out"},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"where your skills can fit in\nto have the greatest impact."},"800":{"dur":3,"text":"I think the idea that we should\nfocus on doing what's valuable"},"803":{"dur":2,"text":"is actually really intuitive one."},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"I want you now to imagine\nthat you are on your deathbed,"},"808":{"dur":3,"text":"and you are looking back\nat your 80,000 hours career,"},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"rather than just about to start it,"},"814":{"dur":4,"text":"and picture to yourselves two ways,\nyou could have gone."},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"In the first you say to yourself,"},"821":{"dur":3,"text":"\"I was good at what I did,\nI enjoyed what I did,"},"825":{"dur":4,"text":"I made lot of money,\nnow I have two houses, and a yacht,"},"829":{"dur":2,"text":"but what was it all for? \""},"832":{"dur":2,"text":"In the second you say to yourself,"},"834":{"dur":4,"text":"\"I absolutely worked my arse off\nat a charity, and it often wasn't easy,"},"838":{"dur":1,"text":"but through my efforts"},"840":{"dur":4,"text":"I was able to prevent the deaths\nof 100 children due to malaria,"},"844":{"dur":1,"text":"but what was it all for?\""},"847":{"dur":2,"text":"The first scenario happens all the time,"},"849":{"dur":3,"text":"but the second scenario\nis almost unimaginable,"},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"of course, that was a worthwhile career."},"856":{"dur":3,"text":"Altruism is one thing you'll never regret,"},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"if we really want to be fulfilled\nin our own careers,"},"862":{"dur":2,"text":"we have to stop focusing so much\non our own interests,"},"865":{"dur":3,"text":"and instead, ask what we can do\nfor other people."},"868":{"dur":4,"text":"Imagine a world in which\nthat was the thought on everyone's minds."},"873":{"dur":4,"text":"So, to find a work you love,\ndon't just follow your passion,"},"878":{"dur":1,"text":"rather do what's valuable."},"880":{"dur":3,"text":"Explore, build skills, \nsolve big pressing problems."},"886":{"dur":1,"text":"And from that,"},"887":{"dur":3,"text":"fulfillment and a passionate\ncareer will emerge."},"890":{"dur":2,"text":"You've got 80,000 hours in your career,"},"893":{"dur":2,"text":"don't waste them, do what's valuable."},"896":{"dur":2,"text":"(Applause)"}}
