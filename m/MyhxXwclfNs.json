all of you"},"25":{"dur":3,"text":"for inviting me to come and to talk to you"},"29":{"dur":4,"text":"about well-being and making bridges\nacross disciplines."},"35":{"dur":4,"text":"As you've heard, there's a background\nof many different approaches."},"40":{"dur":1,"text":"Today you've heard from artists,"},"42":{"dur":1,"text":"you've heard from people"},"43":{"dur":3,"text":"who are really trying\nto make the world a better place,"},"46":{"dur":2,"text":"trying to find meaning in life."},"48":{"dur":3,"text":"When we think about well-being in life,"},"52":{"dur":3,"text":"I want to introduce you to one idea,"},"55":{"dur":4,"text":"and we'll explore if that idea\nhas relevance for you."},"60":{"dur":4,"text":"That's the idea called integration."},"65":{"dur":3,"text":"Integration is a word we use"},"68":{"dur":5,"text":"to describe how different elements\ncan be brought together"},"74":{"dur":1,"text":"in a functional way,"},"76":{"dur":4,"text":"so that you can create\nharmony in your life."},"80":{"dur":2,"text":"Integration is an amazing concept"},"83":{"dur":3,"text":"that has implications\nfor what we do as a society,"},"87":{"dur":3,"text":"and it even has implications\nfor what we do"},"90":{"dur":2,"text":"inside of our own reflective inner life."},"94":{"dur":1,"text":"Let me share with you a story"},"95":{"dur":4,"text":"about how this notion of well-being\nand integration first came about,"},"100":{"dur":1,"text":"and then I'm going to ask you"},"102":{"dur":4,"text":"to reflect in your own life\non some aspects of integration."},"107":{"dur":2,"text":"For me, when I was in college,"},"109":{"dur":4,"text":"I was very interested\nin how life created itself,"},"114":{"dur":3,"text":"and I was studying the fish 'salmon'"},"118":{"dur":3,"text":"that could move from fresh water,\nwhere it hatched,"},"122":{"dur":2,"text":"to salt water, where it could\nlive most of its life."},"125":{"dur":5,"text":"I was very interested in knowing\nhow a salmon could survive that change"},"130":{"dur":4,"text":"from fresh water to salt water, which is\nan extremely big change in its life."},"135":{"dur":2,"text":"So we went searching for the enzyme,"},"138":{"dur":3,"text":"the molecule that could allow\nthe salmon to do that."},"142":{"dur":3,"text":"During the daytime,\nwhen I was trying to find that enzyme,"},"146":{"dur":2,"text":"I was also being trained\nto work in the evening"},"150":{"dur":2,"text":"on a suicide prevention service."},"153":{"dur":2,"text":"And I know here in Prague,\nlike in many cities,"},"156":{"dur":4,"text":"you have had a number of suicides\ngoing on on the local bridge,"},"161":{"dur":4,"text":"as we had had, too,\nin Southern California and other areas."},"165":{"dur":6,"text":"What struck me about suicide was\nthat someone had reached"},"172":{"dur":3,"text":"such a point of pain in their life,\nsuch a point of isolation,"},"176":{"dur":5,"text":"that they would make a decision\nand carry out an act to end their life."},"181":{"dur":4,"text":"What was going on when that was\nthe opposite of well-being?"},"185":{"dur":3,"text":"So, in the evening I was\nworking on a phone service,"},"188":{"dur":1,"text":"and what we learned was"},"190":{"dur":4,"text":"that the way you communicated\nas a worker on the phone line"},"194":{"dur":5,"text":"about the emotions of another human being"},"200":{"dur":3,"text":"could actually make the difference\nbetween life and death."},"204":{"dur":1,"text":"So, in the evenings I was learning"},"205":{"dur":3,"text":"that emotions had something to do\nwith life and death,"},"209":{"dur":1,"text":"and during the day I was learning"},"210":{"dur":3,"text":"that enzymes had something to do\nwith life or death."},"214":{"dur":4,"text":"The thing that really bugged me was:"},"218":{"dur":5,"text":"could you find something in common\nbetween communication about emotions"},"224":{"dur":3,"text":"- the feelings we have,\nthe inner subjective life,"},"227":{"dur":3,"text":"the thing that gives us hope,\nthat which gives us vitality in life -"},"232":{"dur":3,"text":"and also the molecules that kept us alive?"},"237":{"dur":1,"text":"In the intervening years"},"238":{"dur":3,"text":"of going from being\na biochemistry undergraduate student"},"241":{"dur":3,"text":"to a medical student,\nto entering in pediatrics and psychiatry,"},"245":{"dur":1,"text":"and then doing research,"},"247":{"dur":4,"text":"what became amazing was\nthat in the patients I was seeing,"},"252":{"dur":3,"text":"we, at that time,\nin the field of mental health,"},"255":{"dur":1,"text":"were struggling with this tension"},"257":{"dur":4,"text":"that was the same thing\nthat had come out in college:"},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"was the human mind just something"},"264":{"dur":4,"text":"that came from the way\nmolecules were interacting in the brain?"},"270":{"dur":4,"text":"Were our lives just about enzymes?"},"274":{"dur":2,"text":"Or was there something real\nabout emotions?"},"278":{"dur":2,"text":"What was amazing was"},"280":{"dur":6,"text":"that for many people\nthe inner life of emotions was everything,"},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"but for many of my teachers,"},"289":{"dur":3,"text":"they didn't even know\nthat we had emotions as students,"},"292":{"dur":1,"text":"or that their patients had emotions,"},"294":{"dur":1,"text":"and you'd find people"},"296":{"dur":3,"text":"who somehow didn't see\nthat other people had emotions."},"299":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't know if you've ever met\nanyone like that, but if you have,"},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"what does it feel like inside of you"},"305":{"dur":3,"text":"when someone doesn't recognize\nthat you have an inner core,"},"309":{"dur":4,"text":"an inner subjective center\nof your narrative self?"},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"If they ignore that?\nWhat does that feel like for you?"},"317":{"dur":1,"text":"Does it feel good?"},"321":{"dur":1,"text":"Or does it feel bad?"},"323":{"dur":1,"text":"(Audience) Bad."},"324":{"dur":1,"text":"It feels bad."},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"There's something very disconnecting"},"328":{"dur":5,"text":"when another human being doesn't see\nthat you have differentiated self,"},"333":{"dur":4,"text":"that you have your own\ninternal sense of being."},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"What struck me\nwhen I became a psychiatrist was"},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"there was something about that,"},"343":{"dur":3,"text":"that when we could honor the differences"},"347":{"dur":3,"text":"between you and me in a relationship,"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"that something very special happened."},"355":{"dur":4,"text":"And when we produced linkages,\ncompassionate communication,"},"360":{"dur":3,"text":"something almost magical happened:"},"364":{"dur":3,"text":"vitality emerged, harmony emerged,"},"367":{"dur":3,"text":"a sense of well-being in a relationship"},"370":{"dur":5,"text":"seemed to come when we would honor\ndifferences and promote linkages"},"376":{"dur":3,"text":"by ways of compassionate communication."},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"What was amazing about that was:"},"383":{"dur":4,"text":"in my work with enzymes,\nenzymes did a similar kind of thing."},"387":{"dur":4,"text":"They took different elements\nof what was going on in the cell,"},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"and could coordinate and balance"},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"the different elements\nof the cellular system"},"398":{"dur":6,"text":"to allow the organism to reproduce,\nto grow, to develop, to adapt,"},"405":{"dur":5,"text":"and that this honoring differences\nand promoting linkages within molecules,"},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"which we call integration,"},"414":{"dur":5,"text":"seemed to be identical to the process\nthat happened in relationships."},"420":{"dur":3,"text":"At that time, what I wanted to know was:"},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"if this honoring of differences\nand promoting linkages"},"427":{"dur":1,"text":"was the basis of health,"},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"and the word we use for that\nis integration,"},"432":{"dur":2,"text":"what could science tell us?"},"435":{"dur":1,"text":"What could everyday living tell us?"},"436":{"dur":1,"text":"What could jokes tell us?"},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"What could creativity tell us?"},"440":{"dur":4,"text":"What could art tell us\nabout the centrality of integration?"},"445":{"dur":3,"text":"It turns out that when you look\nat the mathematics of integration,"},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"an amazing thing happens."},"453":{"dur":4,"text":"Have you ever walked\nalong the [bank] of a river?"},"457":{"dur":1,"text":"Any of you ever do that?"},"459":{"dur":1,"text":"(Audience) Yes."},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"You noticed how the river\nflows in a certain way,"},"464":{"dur":4,"text":"and it has one bank on one side,\nand then you have the other side."},"468":{"dur":4,"text":"You can go on either side\nof the river, or go down the river."},"473":{"dur":3,"text":"It turns out that integration\nis like a river."},"477":{"dur":3,"text":"Integration is \nwhere there's a sense of harmony"},"481":{"dur":4,"text":"that's flexible, and adaptive,\nand full of vitality."},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"But when you don't link\ndifferentiated parts,"},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"when you don't have integration,"},"492":{"dur":4,"text":"it turns out that the science\nof integration from mathematics says,"},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"\"You're going to go on one of two banks,\""},"498":{"dur":3,"text":"as if you're leaving the river of harmony."},"502":{"dur":3,"text":"One bank is the bank of chaos,"},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"where things are out of control,\nunpredictable, flooding you,"},"510":{"dur":3,"text":"and the other bank\nis the bank of rigidity."},"515":{"dur":2,"text":"When I read that, it blew my mind"},"518":{"dur":5,"text":"because every patient, every person\nI was seeing for psychotherapy,"},"523":{"dur":4,"text":"in my experience, was coming in\nfrom either chaos, or rigidity, or both."},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"If someone has been\ntraumatized, for example,"},"530":{"dur":4,"text":"they'd be rigidly avoiding\nthe experiences that they had had,"},"534":{"dur":4,"text":"or in contrast, the same person\nwould also be flooded with feelings,"},"539":{"dur":1,"text":"and flooded with images,"},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"and flooded with memories\nof the traumatic event."},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"That would be an example\nof chaos or rigidity."},"546":{"dur":4,"text":"Or if someone had a difficulty\nnot related to a trauma,"},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"but related perhaps to their genes,"},"553":{"dur":4,"text":"and they had a disorder like, for example,\nmanic-depressive illness,"},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"also called bipolar disorder,"},"560":{"dur":4,"text":"they could be shut down in depression,\nwhich would be the rigidity part,"},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"or they'd be flooded with mania"},"567":{"dur":3,"text":"- thoughts intruding,\nbehaviors intruding, emotions intruding."},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"Then I turned to the psychiatric Bible."},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"\"The diagnostic and statistical\nmanual of mental disorders\","},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"that we\u2019ve now been using\nfor a third of a century."},"583":{"dur":5,"text":"It turns out that every symptom\nof every single syndrome"},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"in that entire book"},"591":{"dur":3,"text":"can be understood\nas either chaos or rigidity."},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"Then the question came up:"},"596":{"dur":5,"text":"could it be that well-being\nis integration,"},"603":{"dur":5,"text":"and impairments to mental well-being\n- as we call that in mental health -"},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"when you have an impairment,\nit's impairments to integration,"},"612":{"dur":3,"text":"and so you become either chaotic or rigid."},"616":{"dur":4,"text":"What happened in the last 12 years"},"620":{"dur":3,"text":"is we now have evidence\nto support that perspective."},"624":{"dur":3,"text":"Then, in fact, the major\npsychiatric disorders,"},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"whether they're caused\nby genes, or toxins,"},"631":{"dur":1,"text":"or other elements in the environment,"},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"not from experience,"},"635":{"dur":2,"text":"these disorders,\nlike manic depressive illness,"},"637":{"dur":1,"text":"or schizophrenia, or autism,"},"639":{"dur":5,"text":"they all are examples in the brain\nwhere you aren't differentiating areas,"},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"or you're not linking those areas\nthat are differentiating."},"648":{"dur":1,"text":"So, it's an impairment to integration."},"650":{"dur":4,"text":"Even in the disorder of people\nwho are abused, you've got this situation."},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"An incredible opportunity then became:"},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"could we take a science"},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"that you may have heard about,\ncalled neuroplasticity,"},"664":{"dur":5,"text":"the division of neuroscience that says\nyou can actually change your brain"},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"throughout your entire lifetime?"},"672":{"dur":4,"text":"Not just during the early years,\nduring childhood and beyond,"},"677":{"dur":1,"text":"but throughout your lifetime."},"679":{"dur":1,"text":"If that were true,"},"681":{"dur":5,"text":"could you actually create an approach\nthat helped people integrate their brains?"},"687":{"dur":3,"text":"Could you actually change\nthe structure of the brain?"},"692":{"dur":3,"text":"It turns out that we're now\ngetting evidence that you can do that."},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"There are number of approaches to show"},"697":{"dur":4,"text":"that you can stream\nenergy and information,"},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"the physical aspect of life,"},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"where you actually think\na certain thought,"},"707":{"dur":1,"text":"or focus your attention."},"708":{"dur":1,"text":"What you're basically doing"},"710":{"dur":3,"text":"is streaming energy and information\nthrough your brain."},"714":{"dur":4,"text":"It's basically a part of what neuroscience\ntells us the brain does."},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"If you can do this in a way"},"721":{"dur":3,"text":"to actually get the brain\nto differentiate its parts"},"725":{"dur":1,"text":"- like the left side and the right side,"},"727":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't know if you've ever heard\nIain McGilchrist beautiful work"},"731":{"dur":5,"text":"on left-right brain differences\nthat he's summarized in his writings -"},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"but what you can find is\nyou can actually find a way"},"739":{"dur":4,"text":"to differentiate the left\nfrom the right, and then link them."},"743":{"dur":5,"text":"So, you can take the linguistic\nand language-based logical ways of being"},"749":{"dur":3,"text":"that the left creates\nin tearing things down,"},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"and the way the right\nkind of pulls things together,"},"755":{"dur":2,"text":"seeing the context\nand the whole of everything."},"758":{"dur":3,"text":"When you bring them together:\ncreativity emerges."},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"When we think\nabout all of the different talks"},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"that you've heard before,\nthat you'll hear in this set,"},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"you can think about\nhow does the creativity"},"772":{"dur":4,"text":"that comes from a person\npursuing a passion,"},"777":{"dur":3,"text":"or an individual finding\nan artistic expression,"},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"or someone dealing with something\nas overwhelming as you'll hear about,"},"783":{"dur":1,"text":"as the Holocaust."},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"How do you actually find\na creative way of living"},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"that brings vitality and well-being?"},"791":{"dur":1,"text":"What I\u2019m going to suggest to you is"},"792":{"dur":4,"text":"that each of those are examples\nof creating integration in your life."},"798":{"dur":4,"text":"One way we can approach this\nis in our individual work."},"803":{"dur":1,"text":"There are all sorts of studies now"},"804":{"dur":2,"text":"to show you can integrate the brain"},"807":{"dur":4,"text":"by doing something\ncalled mindfulness training."},"811":{"dur":5,"text":"You can integrate the brain\nby pursuing creative activities."},"817":{"dur":4,"text":"When you see what Sir Ken Robinson,\nfor example, does in his beautiful work"},"821":{"dur":5,"text":"on finding your element and seeing\nhow creativity can inform schools."},"827":{"dur":3,"text":"Creativity emerges from integration."},"831":{"dur":4,"text":"So, what I'd like to live you with\nis this incredible opportunity you have."},"837":{"dur":4,"text":"Right now, think for a moment\nabout times in your life"},"842":{"dur":4,"text":"when your life may have become\nrigid, shutdown, not moving."},"849":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, think about a time, at that moment"},"853":{"dur":4,"text":"where something in your life going on\ndidn't honor differences,"},"860":{"dur":2,"text":"like between you and someone else,"},"863":{"dur":3,"text":"or didn't promote linkages\nbetween you and someone else,"},"867":{"dur":2,"text":"or even these things\ncan be going on inside of you,"},"869":{"dur":5,"text":"a part of you really wants to be wild,\ngoing out and exploring things;"},"874":{"dur":2,"text":"another part of you wants\nto be domestic and stay at home."},"877":{"dur":3,"text":"How do you actually honor\nthose differences and promote linkages?"},"880":{"dur":1,"text":"Think about the time when you were rigid,"},"882":{"dur":2,"text":"and maybe even it was a time\nwhen you also became chaotic,"},"885":{"dur":3,"text":"exploding in anger,\nor being really frustrated."},"889":{"dur":3,"text":"As you reflect on that, think about how,"},"893":{"dur":3,"text":"if you would introduce\nthe idea of integration then,"},"897":{"dur":3,"text":"and now, from this day forward,\nif you introduce the idea of integration,"},"901":{"dur":3,"text":"how can you literally\nreflect on your life,"},"904":{"dur":4,"text":"either what's going on inside of you,\nor between you and others,"},"909":{"dur":4,"text":"and then find a way\nto honor the differences"},"913":{"dur":2,"text":"going on inside you or between you,"},"916":{"dur":1,"text":"and then promote linkages."},"918":{"dur":3,"text":"What I want to urge you to consider\nis that if you do that,"},"922":{"dur":5,"text":"you'll find you empower yourself\nto use all the science of the brain"},"927":{"dur":5,"text":"and all the science of the well-being\nto actually bring vitality to yourself."},"933":{"dur":2,"text":"Not only will you make\nyour life more

schools,"},"946":{"dur":2,"text":"and trying to bring this out\ninto the communities,"},"949":{"dur":3,"text":"what's been absolutely incredible"},"952":{"dur":3,"text":"was to realize\nwhen this process of integration"},"956":{"dur":5,"text":"that we create inside of ourselves\nand with others is made visible,"},"962":{"dur":6,"text":"the outcome of such a process\nis kindness and compassion."},"970":{"dur":1,"text":"And if you have an interest"},"972":{"dur":2,"text":"in not only bringing\nwell-being into your life,"},"975":{"dur":4,"text":"but also creating more kindness\nand
