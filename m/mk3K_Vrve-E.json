one, anger."},"515":{"dur":1,"text":"And it brings me to the crux"},"517":{"dur":3,"text":"of what's going on, or what I perceive as going on,"},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"in the world

this."},"585":{"dur":3,"text":"And what they've realized"},"589":{"dur":4,"text":"is that using violence in the situations they operate in"},"594":{"dur":4,"text":"is not only less humane,"},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"but it's less effective"},"601":{"dur":6,"text":"than using methods that connect people with people, that rebuild."},"607":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think that the U.S. military"},"611":{"dur":6,"text":"is finally beginning to get this."},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"Up to now their counter-terrorism policy"},"621":{"dur":4,"text":"has been to kill insurgents at almost any cost,"},"625":{"dur":3,"text":"and if civilians get in the way,"},"629":{"dur":4,"text":"that's written as \"collateral damage.\""},"633":{"dur":6,"text":"And this is so infuriating and humiliating"},"640":{"dur":2,"text":"for the population of Afghanistan,"},"642":{"dur":4,"text":"that it makes the recruitment for al-Qaeda very easy,"},"646":{"dur":3,"text":"when people are so

cue from,"},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"and that's a brilliant U.S. lieutenant colonel"},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"called Chris Hughes."},"673":{"dur":4,"text":"And he was leading his men down the streets of Najaf --"},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"in Iraq actually --"},"680":{"dur":5,"text":"and suddenly people were pouring out of the houses on either side of the road,"},"685":{"dur":4,"text":"screaming,

ground."},"716":{"dur":6,"text":"And complete silence fell."},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"And after about two minutes,"},"725":{"dur":4,"text":"everybody moved aside and went home."},"729":{"dur":5,"text":"Now that to me is wisdom in action."},"734":{"dur":4,"text":"In the moment, that's what he did."},"739":{"dur":5,"text":"And it's happening everywhere

fuel,"},"864":{"dur":2,"text":"cooperating with others,"},"867":{"dur":1,"text":"banding together with others,"},"869":{"dur":2,"text":"courage,"},"871":{"dur":6,"text":"and most importantly, commitment to active non-violence."},"878":{"dur":4,"text":"Now I don't just believe in non-violence."},"882":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't have to believe in it."},"885":{"dur":3,"text":"I see evidence

can bring to an end"},"904":{"dur":4,"text":"the bloodiest century that humanity has ever known."},"909":{"dur":7,"text":"And we can organize to overcome oppression"},"917":{"dur":2,"text":"by opening our hearts"},"919":{"dur":5,"text":"as well as strengthening this incredible resolve."},"925":{"dur":4,"text":"And this open-heartedness is exactly what I've experienced"},"930":{"dur":4,"text":"in
