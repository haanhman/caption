all going to enjoy it,"},"28":{"dur":3,"text":"is because TED audiences\nare always fantastic."},"32":{"dur":1,"text":"I think they are charming,"},"33":{"dur":1,"text":"they are intelligent,"},"35":{"dur":1,"text":"and they are attractive."},"36":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll just try to prove that now."},"38":{"dur":2,"text":"Hands up if you are sitting\nnext to somebody"},"41":{"dur":2,"text":"charming, intelligent, and attractive."},"43":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"44":{"dur":1,"text":"You see?"},"45":{"dur":3,"text":"I was right to be optimistic,\nI really was!"},"49":{"dur":3,"text":"I know we've all heard of glass\nhalf-empty and glass half-full,"},"52":{"dur":3,"text":"but I like to look at things\nin a slightly different way."},"57":{"dur":2,"text":"Here's a brilliant cartoon by Janet Brown,"},"60":{"dur":1,"text":"it's not about half-empty and half-full,"},"62":{"dur":1,"text":"it's about \"not what I ordered.\""},"63":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"64":{"dur":2,"text":"An outrageous optimism is about having"},"67":{"dur":2,"text":"a full glass of exactly what you ordered,"},"70":{"dur":1,"text":"and I'd like to talk to you"},"71":{"dur":4,"text":"about how that worked for me\nand for the little village where I live."},"75":{"dur":3,"text":"I'd like to start by

\"The Family of Man.\""},"85":{"dur":2,"text":"I've always loved that photo"},"87":{"dur":3,"text":"because I like seeing people\nhaving a good time."},"91":{"dur":3,"text":"Radical, I know, but just bear with me."},"94":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't know what these guys were doing,"},"97":{"dur":3,"text":"that could be in an early TED talk,\nthey could be watching a funny film."},"101":{"dur":3,"text":"I noticed that there aren't\nmany funny films out there"},"104":{"dur":2,"text":"which is a shame because\neverybody loves funny films."},"107":{"dur":3,"text":"So I thought: \"I know.\nI'm going to make a funny film.\""},"110":{"dur":4,"text":"And I thought I'm not just going to make\nthis on my phone and put it on YouTube"},"115":{"dur":2,"text":"because that would be cautious optimism,"},"117":{"dur":4,"text":"and cautious optimists are basically\npessimists having a good day."},"122":{"dur":2,"text":"(Laughter)"},"124":{"dur":3,"text":"So I thought I'm going to be\noutrageously optimistic."},"128":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to write this,"},"129":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to direct it,"},"131":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm going to put the whole thing on\nand not only that,"},"134":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm going to premiere in Leicester Square."},"138":{"dur":4,"text":"And as anybody who knows\nanything about film will tell you,"},"142":{"dur":2,"text":"that is absolute madness."},"145":{"dur":3,"text":"But fortunately, I didn't know\nanything about film."},"149":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"150":{"dur":2,"text":"And, in fact, had I known\nwhat I was doing,"},"152":{"dur":2,"text":"I would not have got anywhere."},"155":{"dur":3,"text":"But I decided the only way\nI was going to make this film,"},"158":{"dur":4,"text":"was to get the whole village\nwhere I live to make it with me."},"162":{"dur":1,"text":"I live in a small village in Oxfordshire."},"164":{"dur":4,"text":"We have a few houses, some nice farms,\nand a little stately home in the middle."},"169":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, one evening\nI went out into the village,"},"172":{"dur":3,"text":"and I put these posters\nall over the village, and they said:"},"175":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Brad Pitt won't be in it,"},"179":{"dur":1,"text":"but you could be!\""},"180":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"182":{"dur":1,"text":"I called a meeting at the village hall,"},"184":{"dur":2,"text":"and I thought no one\nis going to turn up at all,"},"186":{"dur":2,"text":"but that village hall\nwas absolutely packed."},"189":{"dur":3,"text":"I learned the first thing\nabout outrageous optimism,"},"193":{"dur":4,"text":"that if you share your dream,\npeople will come."},"197":{"dur":2,"text":"The village started to get to work."},"199":{"dur":1,"text":"We knew three things about Hollywood."},"201":{"dur":1,"text":"We knew it's not about the art,"},"203":{"dur":3,"text":"it's about power, money, and sex."},"206":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"207":{"dur":3,"text":"And in Kingston Bagpuize, in Oxforshire,\nwe don't have any of those."},"210":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"212":{"dur":1,"text":"We don't have any of those,"},"213":{"dur":2,"text":"so the only way we were\ngoing to get them was by asking,"},"216":{"dur":1,"text":"so we started asking."},"217":{"dur":2,"text":"The first thing we needed was power."},"219":{"dur":2,"text":"The power in Kingstone Bagpuize\nis the parish council,"},"222":{"dur":3,"text":"they decide what happens in the village\nand what doesn't happen."},"225":{"dur":1,"text":"We asked the parish council"},"227":{"dur":1,"text":"\u2014 here they are! \u2014"},"228":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"229":{"dur":2,"text":"practicing for the village fate,\nso, obviously,"},"231":{"dur":3,"text":"they're the right kind of people,\nthey said yes immediately."},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"I thought: \"Well, this asking\npeople in power works,"},"237":{"dur":3,"text":"so I'll move up the food chain\nand I'll ask our MP.\""},"241":{"dur":3,"text":"This is him shortly after I asked him."},"244":{"dur":5,"text":"I said: \"We are making a film\nin the village with 2000 of your voters."},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"Would you like to help?\""},"254":{"dur":2,"text":"Funny enough, he did.\nHis name is Ed."},"256":{"dur":3,"text":"I learned something\nalso about asking people."},"261":{"dur":2,"text":"First of all, people in power\nare just people like us,"},"263":{"dur":2,"text":"normal people\nwith slightly bigger offices,"},"266":{"dur":1,"text":"and, most importantly,"},"268":{"dur":4,"text":"people in power are often\nas surprised as you are"},"272":{"dur":1,"text":"that they are in power."},"274":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"275":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes."},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"So don't ever hesitate\nto ask them anything."},"279":{"dur":1,"text":"So, we had the power."},"281":{"dur":2,"text":"Then we needed the money."},"284":{"dur":3,"text":"We asked the people we knew,\nand they asked people they knew."},"287":{"dur":3,"text":"We unleashed the power of social media,"},"290":{"dur":4,"text":"which in Kingstone Bagpuize means\nputting a little note up the bus stop,"},"294":{"dur":0,"text":"(Laughter)"},"295":{"dur":1,"text":"and then we raised the money."},"297":{"dur":3,"text":"We didn't raise a huge amount\nof money, but we raised enough."},"301":{"dur":3,"text":"What was really important\nis the money we didn't spend."},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"And the money we didn't spend\nwas on two things:"},"307":{"dur":4,"text":"it was on accommodation \nand hotels, and it was on catering"},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"because they cost \na fortune in making a film."},"314":{"dur":3,"text":"Instead, I went to the Women's Institute,"},"317":{"dur":1,"text":"\u2014 here they are \u2014"},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"and I said: \"Would you mind\ndoing the catering for the film?\""},"321":{"dur":1,"text":"They said: \"Yes, of course!"},"323":{"dur":3,"text":"We'll do a few scones,\nand we'll use the big teapot.\""},"326":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"327":{"dur":5,"text":"It turned out in the end\nthey catered for up to 60 people,"},"333":{"dur":1,"text":"three times a day,"},"334":{"dur":1,"text":"for six weeks,"},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"and that is a hell of a teapot."},"338":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"339":{"dur":2,"text":"The most wonderful thing\nwas [that] a woman came to me,"},"342":{"dur":1,"text":"she's not on that photo, and she said:"},"343":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Guy, I know nothing about film,\nbut I do know about making fairy cakes,"},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going to make you\na thousand fairy cakes.\""},"349":{"dur":4,"text":"That's what she did, and here they are \u2014"},"353":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"We didn't spend any money\non hotels either,"},"357":{"dur":2,"text":"because all the professional\ncast and crew,"},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"stayed with people in the village,"},"362":{"dur":1,"text":"and that worked really well."},"363":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, some of them are still there,\nhaven't got rid of them yet."},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"So, we had the money, we had the power,"},"369":{"dur":1,"text":"and the last thing we needed was the sex."},"371":{"dur":3,"text":"We wanted to do a romantic comedy,\nso we needed somebody good-looking,"},"375":{"dur":3,"text":"and, sadly, there are no good looking\npeople in Kingstone Bagpuize,"},"379":{"dur":4,"text":"apart from the Women's Institute,\nobviously, just making that clear."},"383":{"dur":1,"text":"But I had a friend,"},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"I had a friend, and he said he knew"},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"a very good-looking guy\nwho lived in London."},"389":{"dur":3,"text":"I thought: \"Well, if he lives in London,\nhe must be attractive!\""},"392":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"394":{"dur":3,"text":"Here he is, Tom Mitchelson,\nand he's a very great-looking guy."},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"I had lunch with him and I said:"},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Would you like to be\nthe star in our film?\""},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"He said yes immediately,\nand he told me afterwards"},"405":{"dur":4,"text":"he just wanted to get out\nof the restaurant as quickly as possible,"},"409":{"dur":1,"text":"because there is a very fine line"},"411":{"dur":5,"text":"between being an outrageous optimist\nand being a crazed fantasist."},"417":{"dur":1,"text":"But the other lesson there"},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"is when you're outrageously optimistic,\npeople often say yes"},"421":{"dur":3,"text":"because they don't believe\nanything is ever going to happen,"},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"and when it does, it's too late."},"427":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"So, we had the money, we had the power"},"431":{"dur":1,"text":"and we had the good-looking cast."},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"Then we started to make the film."},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"Six weeks the whole village\nworked together."},"437":{"dur":3,"text":"When the whole community works together\nand everyone knows each other,"},"441":{"dur":1,"text":"that changes the community forever."},"443":{"dur":1,"text":"So, we made our film,"},"444":{"dur":1,"text":"everybody went home,"},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"and I sat down to edit\nthe whole thing together."},"448":{"dur":3,"text":"The good news was it was in focus."},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"The bad news was it was 4 hours long,"},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"it wasn't funny, it didn't make any sense"},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"[it] didn't make any sense at all."},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"So we knew that the critics would love it!"},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"466":{"dur":1,"text":"But obviously, we didn't,\nit was our film,"},"468":{"dur":3,"text":"and I've promised the whole village\nthat we're going to Leicester Square,"},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'd just given them a big mess\nthat was not going anywhere."},"474":{"dur":1,"text":"It was about this time"},"475":{"dur":3,"text":"when I stopped going out\ninto the village during daylight hours."},"478":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"479":{"dur":3,"text":"But the thing about outrageous optimism"},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"is that it works best\nwhen things are at their bleakest."},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"I didn't know how we\nare going to move forward,"},"488":{"dur":3,"text":"but I was sure that the universe\nwould provide some way of moving forward."},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"What the universe provided, was a woman,"},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"a very special woman called Beverly Mills."},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"She had seen this 4-hour epic,\nand she said to me:"},"499":{"dur":4,"text":"\"Guy, you've got a good film\nin there, but that's not it.\""},"504":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"505":{"dur":1,"text":"I listened to her very, very carefully,"},"507":{"dur":3,"text":"because she was and is\na BAFTA-award-winning editor,"},"510":{"dur":4,"text":"and she reedited our entire film\nfor nothing, between Hollywood epics,"},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"and I didn't even have to ask her."},"517":{"dur":3,"text":"The wonderful thing was she gave us\nthis fantastic 90-minute film"},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"called \"Tortoise in Love.\""},"522":{"dur":4,"text":"The only downside was that half\nof my friends, neighbours, and relatives"},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"were now on the cutting room floor."},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"So I had to options:"},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"one, I could emigrate to Canada,"},"533":{"dur":4,"text":"or we could have outtakes\nthat were twice as long as the film,"},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"and, obviously, that's what we went for."},"539":{"dur":1,"text":"So, we had the film,"},"541":{"dur":3,"text":"and then for the first time\nI went to Leicester Square."},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"By myself, I looked around\nLeicester Square,"},"547":{"dur":4,"text":"and I noticed that they\nwere rebuilding it for the Olympics."},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"So, right then and there,\nin Leicester Square,"},"554":{"dur":3,"text":"I got my phone out,\nand I phoned Westminster Council."},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"And the miracle happened,"},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"they answered the phone."},"562":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"They answered the phone and I said:"},"565":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Look, you're rebuilding the square,\nyou'll need to reopen it,"},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"you'll need to celebrate\nthe reopening it,"},"571":{"dur":3,"text":"you don't want some tired,\nold Batman-Superman premiere"},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"with A-list celebrities\nclogging up the red carpet."},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"What you want is 2,000 yocals,"},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"driving their tractors\ninto Leicester Square"},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"to see a film\nthat they've made themselves.\""},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"They said, \"We'll think about it.\""},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"589":{"dur":3,"text":"They thought about it\nfor 3 months in total silence,"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"and then something\ntruly wonderful happened,"},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"[that] is that our friendly MP, Ed,"},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"was made Minister for Film."},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"605":{"dur":4,"text":"You won't believe the strings\nI had to pull to get him that one!"},"609":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"Of course, then things got a bit easier,"},"614":{"dur":3,"text":"but though Ed was really helpful,\nit wasn't just Ed."},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"It was because people could see"},"619":{"dur":1,"text":"that the dream was about to come true."},"621":{"dur":3,"text":"When that happens,\neverybody is prepared to help."},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"So we got our film to Leicester Square,"},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"we took the village\nall the way to Leicester Square."},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"Here's my friend, a dairy farmer,"},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"who drove his tractor\ninto Leicester Square,"},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"onto the red carpet,"},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"with a matching tractor."},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, that is A-list behaviour."},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"Here is the picture\nthat makes me really, really happy."},"644":{"dur":3,"text":"This is our village in the cinema,\nin Leicester Square,"},"647":{"dur":4,"text":"and, as you'll see, it is very, very much\nlike the first photo I showed you."},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"What makes me really happy,"},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"is there's a lady in the back\nof that photograph,"},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"she wrote to me afterwards, and she said:"},"658":{"dur":4,"text":"\"Guy, until the premiere,\nI had never ever been to London,"},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"and now you've ruined it for me.\""},"665":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Because every time I go to London,"},"669":{"dur":1,"text":"I will expect a red carpet.\""},"671":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"I learned two things"},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"about outrageous optimism\nin that whole project."},"676":{"dur":4,"text":"The first thing I learned\nwas the absolute power of asking people,"},"680":{"dur":4,"text":"and I firmly believe that everybody\nhas a big yes inside them"},"685":{"dur":2,"text":"that's just waiting to get out."},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"The second thing I learned\nwith outrageous optimism,"},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"is you can't do everything yourself."},"693":{"dur":4,"text":"But, that if your roll \nthe red carpet out for other people,"},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"they'll roll the red carpet out for you."},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"That's outrageous optimism."},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you very much indeed."},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you."},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"(Applause)"}}
