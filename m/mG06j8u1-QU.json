number one reason is they did not\ndo well in the first-year courses."},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"And the fact is when people say, it is a K-12\nproblem."},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"No, we know we have to continue to improve\nK-12."},"527":{"dur":5,"text":"But the fact is large numbers of students\nwith 5 on AP exams with perfect math scores"},"533":{"dur":4,"text":"that go to the most prestigious

the background a student"},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"needs?"},"552":{"dur":1,"text":"What kind of math background does a student\nneed?"},"554":{"dur":4,"text":"How are you going to go about making sure\nthat you got faculty ready to work with that"},"558":{"dur":1,"text":"student?"},"559":{"dur":4,"text":"And most important, how will you measure success\nas you look at what happens with students?"},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"So high expectations."},"565":{"dur":3,"text":"The notion of building community among the\nstudents."},"568":{"dur":5,"text":"If you majored in science and engineering\nin this country in the last 25 years, you"},"574":{"dur":6,"text":"know that much of the work is based on a competitive\nbasis, that often we're talking about

everybody knows that you have to be very\ncareful because, quite frankly, if somebody"},"591":{"dur":3,"text":"else gets a higher grade, it means you may\nget a lower grade."},"594":{"dur":5,"text":"So the mind-set, the culture in science teaching\nand learning has to do with a cut-throat approach"},"600":{"dur":1,"text":"too often."},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"And, secondly, the assumption is most people\nwon't make it."},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"I can prove it to you very easily."},"607":{"dur":6,"text":"If you look at the number of seats in the\nsecond-year's work in engineering or in science,"},"614":{"dur":4,"text":"you will see it is about 1\/3 the number of\nseats as in the first-year's work because"},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"the assumption is most won't make it."},"620":{"dur":3,"text":"And as a result, it is a self-fulfilling prophecy."},"624":{"dur":5,"text":"So the question is: How do you build a community\nof students and faculty with this notion
