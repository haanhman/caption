Why should we trust the laws of nature?"},"9123":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, are they going to be the same tomorrow as they were yesterday?"},"9126":{"dur":7,"text":"In fact, some of the greatest scientists that ever lived: Isaac Newton, James Clerk Maxwell, Michael Faraday were creationists."},"9134":{"dur":3,"text":"And as one of them said, you know, he's thinking God's thoughts after Him."},"9137":{"dur":6,"text":"And that's really, modern science came out of that thinking, that we can do experiments today,"},"9143":{"dur":5,"text":"and we can do the same tomorrow.

And you say there are no examples in nature."},"9267":{"dur":4,"text":"There are countless examples of how the process of science makes predictions."},"9271":{"dur":5,"text":"Moderator: Mr. Nye, since evolution teaches that man is evolving and growing smarter over time,"},"9276":{"dur":5,"text":"how can you explain the numerous evidences of man's high intelligence in the past?"},"9282":{"dur":5,"text":"Bill Nye: Hang on, there's no evidence that man or humans are getting smarter."},"9287":{"dur":8,"text":"No, especially if you ever met my old boss. Heh, heh, heh."},"9296":{"dur":9,"text":"No, it's that what happens in evolution. And there's, it's a British word that was used in the middle 1800's."},"9305":{"dur":7,"text":"It's survival of the fittest. And this usage, it doesn't mean the most push-ups or the highest scores on standardized tests."},"9312":{"dur":8,"text":"It means that those that \"fit in\" the best.

Here's an example. These fish have evolved the ability not to see.\""},"9418":{"dur":3,"text":"And, he was going to give an example of blind cave fish."},"9421":{"dur":6,"text":"And he said, \"See, in this cave, they're evolving, because now the ones that are living there, their ancestors had eyes."},"9427":{"dur":4,"text":"Now these ones are blind.\" And I remember, I was talking to my professor, \"But wait a minute!"},"9432":{"dur":4,"text":"Now they can't do something that they could do before.\" Yeah, they might have an advantage in this sense."},"9437":{"dur":3,"text":"In a situation that's dark like that, those with eyes might have got diseases and died out."},"9441":{"dur":4,"text":"Those that had mutations for no eyes are the ones that survived."},"9445":{"dur":3,"text":"It's not survival of the fittest. It's survival of those who survive."},"9448":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's survival of those that have the information in their circumstance to survive,"},"9453":{"dur":3,"text":"but you're not getting new information. You're not getting new function."},"9456":{"dur":6,"text":"There's no example of that at all. So, we need to correctly understand these things."},"9462":{"dur":4,"text":"Moderator: Alright. Um, we're down to our final question here, which I'll give to both of you."},"9467":{"dur":4,"text":"And in the interest of fairness here, because it is a question to the both of you,"},"9471":{"dur":3,"text":"let's give each man two minutes on this if we can, please."},"9475":{"dur":3,"text":"And also, in the interest of you having started first, Mr. Ham, I will have you start first here."},"9478":{"dur":2,"text":"You'll have the first word.

It's very different to any other book out there."},"9503":{"dur":5,"text":"In fact, I don't know of any other religion that has a book that starts off by"},"9509":{"dur":4,"text":"telling you that there's an infinite God, and talks about the origin of the universe,"},"9513":{"dur":2,"text":"and the origin of matter, and the origin of light, and the origin of darkness,"},"9515":{"dur":5,"text":"and the origin of day and night, and the origin of the earth, and the origin of dry land,"},"9521":{"dur":3,"text":"and the origin of plants, and the origin of the sun, moon and stars, the origin of sea creatures,"},"9524":{"dur":3,"text":"the origin of flying creatures, the origin of land creatures, the origin of man,"},"9528":{"dur":4,"text":"the origin of woman, the origin of death, the origin of sin, the origin of marriage,"},"9533":{"dur":4,"text":"the origin of different languages, the origin of clothing, the origin of nations,"},"9537":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean it's a very, very specific book."},"9539":{"dur":5,"text":"And it gives us an account of a global flood and the history and the tower of Babel,"},"9545":{"dur":4,"text":"and if that history is true, then what about the rest of the book?"},"9550":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, that history also says man is a sinner and it says that man is separated from God."},"9555":{"dur":5,"text":"And it gives us a message, that we call the gospel, the message of salvation, that God's son stepped in history"},"9561":{"dur":2,"text":"that God's son stepped in history to die on the cross, to be raised from the dead,"},"9563":{"dur":2,"text":"and offers a free gift of salvation."},"9565":{"dur":3,"text":"Because the history is true, that's why the message based on history is true."},"9569":{"dur":3,"text":"I actually went through some predictions and listed others, and there's a lot more that you can look at,"},"9573":{"dur":5,"text":"and you can go and test it for yourself. If this book really is true,"},"9579":{"dur":1,"text":"it is so specific, it should explain the world, it should make sense of what we see."},"9580":{"dur":2,"text":"The flood. Yeah, we have fossils all over the world."},"9582":{"dur":2,"text":"The tower of Babel, yeah, different people groups, different languages,"},"9585":{"dur":5,"text":"they have flood legends very similar to the Bible. Creation legends similar to the Bible."},"9590":{"dur":2,"text":"There's so much you can look at, and prophesy and so on."},"9593":{"dur":3,"text":"Most of all, as I said to you, the Bible says, if you come to God, believing that he is,"},"9596":{"dur":3,"text":"he'll reveal himself to you. You will know. If you search after truth,"},"9600":{"dur":3,"text":"you really want God to show you, as you would search after silver and gold,"},"9603":{"dur":2,"text":"he will show you. He will reveal himself to you."},"9606":{"dur":1,"text":"Moderator: Mr. Nye?"},"9608":{"dur":5,"text":"Mr. Nye: Would you repeat the question?"},"9613":{"dur":2,"text":"Moderator: The question is: What is the one thing, more than anything else, upon which you base your belief?"},"9616":{"dur":7,"text":"Mr. Nye: As my old professor Carl Sagan said so often,"},"9623":{"dur":9,"text":"when you're in love, you want to tell the world. And I base my beliefs on the information"},"9632":{"dur":4,"text":"and the process that we call science."},"9636":{"dur":2,"text":"It fills me with joy to make discoveries every day of things I'd never seen before."},"9639":{"dur":4,"text":"It fills me with joy to know that we can pursue these answers."},"9643":{"dur":6,"text":"It is a wonderful and astonishing thing to me, that we are, you and I,"},"9650":{"dur":6,"text":"are somehow, at least one of the ways that the universe knows itself."},"9656":{"dur":6,"text":"You and I are a product of the universe. It's astonishing. I admit, I see your faces."},"9663":{"dur":5,"text":"That we have come to be because of the universe's existence."},"9668":{"dur":5,"text":"And we are driven to pursue that. To find out where we came from."},"9673":{"dur":1,"text":"And the second question we all want to know:"},"9675":{"dur":9,"text":"Are we alone? Are we alone in the universe? And these questions are deep within us,"},"9685":{"dur":4,"text":"and they drive us. So the process of science, the way we know nature is the most compelling thing to me."},"9690":{"dur":5,"text":"And I just want to close by reminding everybody what's at stake here."},"9696":{"dur":8,"text":"If we abandon all that we've learned, our ancestors, what they've learned about nature and our place in it,"},"9704":{"dur":3,"text":"if we abandon the process by which we know it,"},"9707":{"dur":4,"text":"if we eschew, if we let go of everything that people have learned before us,"},"9712":{"dur":7,"text":"if we stop driving forward, stop looking for the next answer to the next question,"},"9720":{"dur":6,"text":"we, in the United States, will be outcompeted by other countries, other economies."},"9726":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, that would be okay, I guess, but I was born here. I'm a patriot."},"9730":{"dur":5,"text":"So we have to embrace science education. To the voters and taxpayers that are watching,"},"9735":{"dur":7,"text":"please keep that in mind. We have to keep science education in science and science classes. Thank you."},"9743":{"dur":5,"text":"Moderator: One tiny bit of important housekeeping for everyone here, the county is now under a level two snow emergency."},"9748":{"dur":4,"text":"Drive home carefully.
