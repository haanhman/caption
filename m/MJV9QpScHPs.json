about\nthe nature of the disorder."},"23":{"dur":2,"text":"What a TMJ disorder really is."},"25":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm going to also talk about\nwho is at risk for TMD."},"31":{"dur":3,"text":"And finally, I will touch on\nthe common treatments that"},"34":{"dur":4,"text":"are recognized as\nevidence-based treatment for"},"38":{"dur":0,"text":"TMJ disorders."},"39":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I guess it's customary to"},"45":{"dur":4,"text":"talk about disclosures as\nto if I'm affiliated with"},"50":{"dur":2,"text":"any kind of pharmaceutical\ncompany or anything like that."},"53":{"dur":1,"text":"I have no disclosures\nto be done."},"55":{"dur":6,"text":"So, I wanted to first show\nyou the anatomy of a TMJ."},"61":{"dur":4,"text":"It's a joint that is\nvery unique in the body."},"65":{"dur":1,"text":"It's one of a kind."},"68":{"dur":3,"text":"There is a one disc, and\nyou can picture it as a donut."},"73":{"dur":4,"text":"So, it's a circular,\nbiconcave, just a donut,"},"77":{"dur":2,"text":"just doesn't have the actual\nhole in the middle."},"80":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's kind of like\na donut shape, and"},"82":{"dur":5,"text":"it separates the jawbone,\nwhich you see as the rounded"},"87":{"dur":3,"text":"bone in the picture,\nfrom the skull."},"90":{"dur":3,"text":"And particularly, the fossa,\nthe articular fossa, and"},"94":{"dur":4,"text":"the eminence that you see\nto the right of the fossa."},"98":{"dur":3,"text":"So the disc is flexible."},"101":{"dur":1,"text":"It's fiber cartilage, and"},"103":{"dur":5,"text":"it offers a perfect interface\nbetween the skull and the jaw."},"108":{"dur":5,"text":"It allows for smoother motion."},"114":{"dur":4,"text":"The joint is also particular\nin a sense that not only"},"118":{"dur":4,"text":"it allows rotation of\nthe joint, but it allows for"},"122":{"dur":2,"text":"forward motion of the jaw."},"125":{"dur":3,"text":"So, if you put your hand\nlike slightly over your,"},"129":{"dur":4,"text":"in front of your ear and you\nopen your jaw wide and slow,"},"133":{"dur":2,"text":"you can see that initially,\nit just starts rotating and"},"136":{"dur":3,"text":"then you can feel it\nactually advance forward."},"141":{"dur":3,"text":"And for some people, you can\nactually feel it coming out"},"144":{"dur":4,"text":"slightly, because even though\nthe jaw is seemingly fixed,"},"149":{"dur":3,"text":"the suture that is in\nthe front, it allows for"},"153":{"dur":3,"text":"certain flexibility in and\nout of the joint itself."},"159":{"dur":3,"text":"So, what is a TMJ disorder?"},"165":{"dur":4,"text":"So, a TMJ disorder\nis defined by pain,"},"171":{"dur":2,"text":"either at rest or\nupon function."},"174":{"dur":5,"text":"It is defined by something\nthat is a painful noise."},"180":{"dur":2,"text":"It can also be just\na dysfunction,"},"182":{"dur":4,"text":"like a limited range of\nmotion, or a jaw deviation"},"187":{"dur":4,"text":"such as this, like when you\nopen you go to one side or"},"192":{"dur":4,"text":"you are unable to go from\none side to the other."},"197":{"dur":3,"text":"Or a sudden unexplained bite\nchange, like you wake up and"},"200":{"dur":3,"text":"your jaw is to the front,\nor to the side."},"204":{"dur":2,"text":"Those are considered\nTMJ disorders."},"207":{"dur":4,"text":"They can be associated\nwith headaches, and"},"211":{"dur":2,"text":"ear aches, or ear pain."},"213":{"dur":4,"text":"So, the prevalence\nis 5 to 12%."},"219":{"dur":1,"text":"Vast majority of them women."},"220":{"dur":4,"text":"And the age group is between\npuberty and menopause."},"225":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's some research\nsuggest that there's a link"},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"with hormones as\nthe cartilage and"},"230":{"dur":3,"text":"the TMJ has\nestrogen receptors."},"234":{"dur":3,"text":"So that would make sense since\nthe age group is, you know,"},"237":{"dur":1,"text":"puberty to menopause."},"239":{"dur":4,"text":"So that leaves us to,\nwhat is not a TMJ disorder?"},"243":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's pretty obvious."},"247":{"dur":2,"text":"If there's no pain,\nno dysfunction."},"251":{"dur":3,"text":"Dysfunction is if you're able\nto open your mouth wide,"},"255":{"dur":2,"text":"if you're able to\nchew without pain,"},"258":{"dur":1,"text":"you don't have a TMJ disorder."},"260":{"dur":2,"text":"You may have noises,\nyou may have joint noises, but"},"263":{"dur":3,"text":"you do not have,\nby definition, a TMJ disorder."},"267":{"dur":4,"text":"You can have abnormal\nfindings in an MRI or"},"271":{"dur":4,"text":"an X-ray without\nhaving a TMJ disorder."},"276":{"dur":3,"text":"There are a lot of people,\nand certainly, most of us"},"279":{"dur":4,"text":"over 40 will have some type\nof changes on an X-ray, even"},"283":{"dur":3,"text":"though we are still completely\nasymptomatic, and we can chew,"},"287":{"dur":4,"text":"and we can open our mouth\nwithout any restrictions."},"292":{"dur":3,"text":"So, that's kind of something\nthat comes up a lot."},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, I get patients\nwho come in because"},"298":{"dur":1,"text":"they have joint noises."},"300":{"dur":2,"text":"Because they have been\ntold by their dentist that"},"302":{"dur":1,"text":"they had a TMJ disorder."},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"Or because the dentist\nsaw on the X-ray that"},"306":{"dur":1,"text":"there was something abnormal."},"308":{"dur":1,"text":"So, of course,\nwe can determine it."},"309":{"dur":3,"text":"But by, as a rule of thumb,\nif you don't have any pain or"},"313":{"dur":2,"text":"dysfunction, you don't\nhave a TMJ disorder."},"315":{"dur":0,"text":"You don't have to worry, 'kay?"},"317":{"dur":2,"text":"60% of people pop and\nclick, so"},"320":{"dur":3,"text":"it's a very common incidence."},"324":{"dur":5,"text":"They don't really consider\nit a disorder because"},"330":{"dur":5,"text":"it's a variation of normal,\nat this point."},"335":{"dur":3,"text":"I will come back later about\nthe popping, the mechanism for"},"338":{"dur":1,"text":"popping and clicking."},"340":{"dur":3,"text":"But I wanna touch on\nremodeling of the TMJ,"},"344":{"dur":4,"text":"which sometimes occurs in,\nyou see on an X-ray."},"348":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you look at this X-ray,\nthe TMJ's right,"},"352":{"dur":3,"text":"this is one TMJ,\nthis is the other TMJ, right?"},"355":{"dur":1,"text":"Right and left."},"357":{"dur":2,"text":"So it should be\nkind of rounded and"},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"it should have a continuous\nwhite line around it."},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"And you see here,\nit is a little bit flatter"},"367":{"dur":3,"text":"on the top but it has\na white line around it so."},"370":{"dur":2,"text":"When it has a white line\naround the perimeter"},"373":{"dur":3,"text":"of the condyle, it's\nconsidered remodeling, and"},"376":{"dur":3,"text":"remodeling is a process\nof bone changes."},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"And the bone is\na dynamic structure,"},"382":{"dur":1,"text":"it's not like there to stay."},"384":{"dur":3,"text":"Like for example, if you've\never had braces, what"},"387":{"dur":4,"text":"allows the teeth to move is\nactually the bone remodeling."},"391":{"dur":1,"text":"On one part,"},"392":{"dur":5,"text":"you have some bone destruction\nthat allows it to move,"},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"and then the bone rebuilds on\nthe other side of the tooth,"},"400":{"dur":1,"text":"so it's a completely\nnormal and"},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"natural phenomenon\nto a certain extent."},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"So, if it's a slow process,"},"407":{"dur":5,"text":"and if it's an adaptation\nprocess, it's normal and"},"412":{"dur":3,"text":"it doesn't give people\nany trouble whatsoever."},"415":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is considered\na very normal cone beam CT"},"420":{"dur":0,"text":"scan of the jaw."},"422":{"dur":1,"text":"Which doesn't mean\nthe patient is asymptomatic,"},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"they can have pain\nwith a normal X-ray."},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"That's the other thing.\nYou can have absolutely no"},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"pain with a terrible\nlooking X-ray, and"},"432":{"dur":2,"text":"we can have pain\nwith a normal X-ray."},"435":{"dur":6,"text":"So, what types of TMJ\ndisorder are there?"},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, we classify them as"},"445":{"dur":4,"text":"TMJ disorders involving\nthe muscles of mastication,"},"450":{"dur":5,"text":"involving the joint itself or\npart of a systemic disease."},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"So the muscle disorders\nare for the TMJ, and"},"463":{"dur":4,"text":"the muscles of mastication are\njust exactly the same as for"},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"any muscles in your body."},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"There is muscle ache,"},"472":{"dur":5,"text":"restriction of range of\nmotion, fibrosis, tendinitis."},"477":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, you've had."},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"Some people with tennis elbow,"},"481":{"dur":3,"text":"you can have tendonitis\nof the jaw as well."},"485":{"dur":4,"text":"So, the muscles of\nmastication, and"},"490":{"dur":5,"text":"you can feel those as well,\nare usually for the most part."},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"The masseter and\nthe temporalis muscles."},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"Those are the ones that give\npeople the most trouble."},"499":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you feel here, and you\nput your teeth together, and"},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"then you clench really hard,\nyou will actually"},"506":{"dur":5,"text":"feel a bulge, and\nthat is your masseter muscle."},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"If you put your hands up\nhere by your temples, and"},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"do the same motion."},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"You can also feel\na muscle bulge, and"},"518":{"dur":1,"text":"that's the temporalis muscle."},"520":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a fairly thin muscle,\nbut very, very wide."},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"Both of these muscles help\nto bring the jaw closed."},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"So, a lot of patients\nwho come to our practice"},"533":{"dur":4,"text":"have myalgia or myofascial\npain in the temporalis muscle,"},"537":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean temporalis muscle,\nsorry or the masseter muscle."},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"And that translates\ninto very often,"},"544":{"dur":2,"text":"limitation of their\nrange of motion."},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"They cannot open their\nmouth really wide or"},"549":{"dur":1,"text":"they develop pain."},"550":{"dur":4,"text":"So that's a very\ncommon TMJ disorder."},"555":{"dur":4,"text":"Medial pterygoid is the one\nthat is the mate, if you wish,"},"559":{"dur":4,"text":"of the masseter muscle, but\non the inside of the jaw."},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"And the lateral pterygoid is\nthe muscle that allows you"},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"to bring your jaw from\nside-to-side, and"},"569":{"dur":1,"text":"bring your jaw forward."},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"So, it's a tiny little muscle."},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"We can't palpate it,\nbut occasionally,"},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"it causes problem,\neven though it's pretty rare."},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"Then moving on to\njoint disorders."},"585":{"dur":3,"text":"We can have a joint\ndisorder that is"},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"directly associated with\na disc dysfunction."},"591":{"dur":3,"text":"Remember that little donut\nthat I was showing you?"},"594":{"dur":4,"text":"It's held by ligaments and\nit goes forward and backwards."},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's a lot of\npossibilities for"},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"things to go wrong as\nfar as this little disc."},"604":{"dur":4,"text":"There are, there's trauma of\ncourse, I mean fractures and"},"609":{"dur":4,"text":"so on as well as systemic\ndiseases such as arthritis,"},"613":{"dur":3,"text":"rheumatoid arthritis,\nlupus, and the likes."},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"As well as, of course\nI didn't mention this,"},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"I have some slides on\ntumors of the jaw."},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"So again this is\nthe same slide."},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm never really quite sure\nhow you pronounce this."},"632":{"dur":4,"text":"I usually say\nginglymoid-arthodial joint,"},"636":{"dur":3,"text":"which is the type of\njoint that the TMJ is."},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"So it just means it\nrotates and it slides."},"643":{"dur":4,"text":"So the rotation, lower part"},"648":{"dur":4,"text":"of the joints or the disc with\nthe condyle, so the condylar"},"653":{"dur":4,"text":"rotates in relation to\nthe disc and the translation"},"657":{"dur":3,"text":"is the whole disc, and\ncondyle move forward."},"662":{"dur":4,"text":"I tried to find a video, but I\ncould only go through YouTube"},"666":{"dur":3,"text":"and they were mostly\ndissection videos [LAUGH] so"},"670":{"dur":3,"text":"I didn't think that\nit was a good idea."},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"This is an MRI\npicture of the disk."},"676":{"dur":3,"text":"If you see a little hourglass,\ndarker."},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"Can you see a little\ndarker shadow"},"683":{"dur":1,"text":"in the shape of an hourglass?"},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, this is what\na normal disk looks."},"689":{"dur":4,"text":"And it is held by ligaments\non this side, ligaments and"},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"muscles on this side."},"695":{"dur":4,"text":"So, here, it is the same disc,"},"701":{"dur":5,"text":"but in a more, in a mouth that\nis wider open, and you can see"},"707":{"dur":5,"text":"that the disc is moved forward\nin relation to this eminence."},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"So again,\nthis is a closed mouth,"},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"and this is an open mouth."},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is a normal\nposition of the disc and"},"719":{"dur":1,"text":"normal position\nof the condyle."},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"So, what kind of\ndysfunctions are there?"},"729":{"dur":3,"text":"So we'll start with probably\nthe most common, and"},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"it is when the disc."},"735":{"dur":3,"text":"Which you can see here in the\npicture or here in the model"},"739":{"dur":4,"text":"is completely interior\nto the condyle."},"743":{"dur":3,"text":"If you look back at this one,\nthe back of the disc is"},"747":{"dur":3,"text":"located as 12 'o' clock in\nrelationship to the condyle."},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"On the anterior disc displace,"},"755":{"dur":4,"text":"it's actually way,\nway, way forward."},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's impossible for"},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"the condyle to get into\nthe middle of this disc."},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"It's kinda stuck behind it."},"768":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, usually,\nit's something that"},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"happens very suddenly either\nwhile you're eating or"},"774":{"dur":4,"text":"sometimes when you're yawning\nor pretty abrupt motion."},"779":{"dur":1,"text":"And, all of the sudden,"},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"you won't be able\nto open your mouth."},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a very sudden event."},"786":{"dur":4,"text":"And, sometimes it will\nlast for several hours."},"790":{"dur":4,"text":"And, also,\nit will suddenly get better."},"794":{"dur":1,"text":"Or, you'll have to\ngo to a dentist,"},"796":{"dur":1,"text":"and help put it back in place."},"801":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is is\nthe unfortunately,"},"804":{"dur":2,"text":"this is in an opening motion."},"806":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is closed jaw and this\nis a little bit further open."},"811":{"dur":1,"text":"But you get the idea."},"812":{"dur":5,"text":"It usually is painful,\nbut not necessarily."},"820":{"dur":1,"text":"But, if you try to open,"},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"it will be like you're\nhitting a brick wall."},"824":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, it, there's just\nno give whatsoever."},"829":{"dur":2,"text":"And, this is where I come back\nto the benign clicking that I"},"831":{"dur":1,"text":"was talking to you about."},"833":{"dur":1,"text":"The benign clicking."},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"Oh, there's a spelling\nmistake there."},"837":{"dur":0,"text":"Sorry about that."},"839":{"dur":0,"text":">> No, no."},"840":{"dur":1,"text":"There is no scent, oh, good,"},"841":{"dur":1,"text":"good.\nOkay, good."},"842":{"dur":4,"text":"So, the benign clicking,\nthe clicking that 60% of"},"847":{"dur":3,"text":"people have and don't have any\nproblem with it, actually, one"},"851":{"dur":3,"text":"of our camera people showed\nthat to me earlier today."},"856":{"dur":1,"text":"How many of you have clicking?"},"860":{"dur":2,"text":"Do you have any symptoms\nassociated with it or"},"862":{"dur":1,"text":"do you just have\nbenign clicking?"},"865":{"dur":1,"text":"No dysfunction."},"867":{"dur":2,"text":"Like most people\nhave that situation."},"870":{"dur":4,"text":"So what it is, is in here\nas you can see in figure a,"},"874":{"dur":2,"text":"the disc is also\nanteriorly displaced."},"877":{"dur":4,"text":"But, during the opening motion\nthe condyle is actually able"},"882":{"dur":3,"text":"to go past the posterior part\nof the disc, which is slightly"},"885":{"dur":3,"text":"thicker to get and fall into\nthe middle of the disc."},"889":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is the passing\nthrough and"},"891":{"dur":2,"text":"over the back of the disc\nthat creates the noise."},"897":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's just\na functional noise,"},"900":{"dur":2,"text":"I consider it a nuisance."},"902":{"dur":2,"text":"There's nothing you\nwant to do about it,"},"905":{"dur":1,"text":"there's nothing you\nshould be doing about it,"},"907":{"dur":2,"text":"no surgeries,\nno treatment whatsoever."},"910":{"dur":2,"text":"During the course of your\nlifetime it might change,"},"913":{"dur":4,"text":"it might become a little\nbit later in the motion."},"917":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's say when you're 18, it\nmight be really early because"},"920":{"dur":3,"text":"the disk is just a little\nbit anteriorly displaced."},"924":{"dur":3,"text":"And then as you get\nolder it might be,"},"927":{"dur":3,"text":"you only have a click when you\nopen your mouth really wide."},"931":{"dur":2,"text":"I only have a click\nnow when I yawn, but"},"934":{"dur":1,"text":"I used to have\na click all the time."},"936":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was very\nconvenient because"},"938":{"dur":2,"text":"I could demonstrate it to\nmy patients, you know."},"944":{"dur":5,"text":"So, this is not necessarily\ngoing to evolve to a lock."},"949":{"dur":3,"text":"For the vast majority of\npeople clicking will never"},"953":{"dur":1,"text":"evolve to a lock, but"},"955":{"dur":3,"text":"it's not,\nnobody's able to predict it."},"961":{"dur":5,"text":"This is another one that\npeople have probably heard of."},"966":{"dur":3,"text":"It is an open lock, and\nit's actually a subluxation of"},"970":{"dur":4,"text":"the entire joint in front\nof the articular eminence."},"976":{"dur":3,"text":"And the joint is basically\nnot able to come back"},"979":{"dur":4,"text":"over this bump here and it's\nbeing stuck because the pull"},"984":{"dur":3,"text":"of the muscle's actually\nmaintaining it in that fascia."},"987":{"dur":2,"text":"So the more people try\nto close their mouth,"},"992":{"dur":3,"text":"the least they're likely to\nbecause the pull of the muscle"},"995":{"dur":1,"text":"does not allow\nthe jaw to go back."},"999":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is fairly rare but"},"1001":{"dur":3,"text":"it is an emergency\nbecause you cannot eat,"},"1005":{"dur":3,"text":"you can hardly swallow,\nyou cannot talk and it is"},"1008":{"dur":3,"text":"something that necessitates\nmedical attention to reduce."},"1013":{"dur":2,"text":"And usually I don't see\nthose patients because those"},"1016":{"dur":2,"text":"patients go to an emergency\nroom right away."},"1020":{"dur":2,"text":"I do see quite a bit of close\nlock, and unfortunately,"},"1023":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't see them as\nearly as I should, and"},"1026":{"dur":3,"text":"by the time I see them, the\ntreatments are more limited."},"1030":{"dur":3,"text":"But the open locks, they go\nto the emergency room, and"},"1034":{"dur":1,"text":"rightfully so."},"1038":{"dur":2,"text":"This is a posterior disc\ndisplacement with the disc"},"1041":{"dur":2,"text":"instead of going forward,\ngoes backwards."},"1044":{"dur":1,"text":"This is very rare."},"1046":{"dur":2,"text":"I've actually never\nseen a single one and"},"1048":{"dur":3,"text":"I was unable to find a single\npicture online [LAUGH]."},"1051":{"dur":3,"text":"But it does happen and\nin those situations,"},"1055":{"dur":1,"text":"extremely painful."},"1057":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a very,\nvery painful condition."},"1058":{"dur":3,"text":"Also, rather suddenly, and it\ntranslate the symptoms is that"},"1062":{"dur":3,"text":"you are no longer able to\nbite down completely and"},"1066":{"dur":3,"text":"it's very, very painful to try\nto put your teeth together."},"1073":{"dur":4,"text":"Then we come to arthritis,\na systemic disease, and"},"1077":{"dur":3,"text":"all of them will kinda\nlike this on an X-ray,"},"1081":{"dur":2,"text":"a lot of degeneration\nof the bone."},"1083":{"dur":2,"text":"It's only further testing\nthat will show what kind of"},"1086":{"dur":1,"text":"disorder it is."},"1088":{"dur":3,"text":"Of course, osteoarthritis\nbeing the most common."},"1093":{"dur":3,"text":"The great news in terms of\nthe osteoarthritis of the TMJ"},"1097":{"dur":4,"text":"is that it is unlike\nosteoarthritis of the knee,"},"1102":{"dur":2,"text":"which is a situation where\nyou have the knee that"},"1104":{"dur":3,"text":"degrades to the

burn out."},"1116":{"dur":2,"text":"And the reason for that, is\nthat, as opposed to the knee,"},"1119":{"dur":3,"text":"that has high line cartilage,\nwhich is a type of cartilage,"},"1122":{"dur":3,"text":"where it doesn't have any\nkind of blood supply in it,"},"1126":{"dur":4,"text":"the TMJ is covered with\nfiber cartilage, and"},"1130":{"dur":3,"text":"so the
