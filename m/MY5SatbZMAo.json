information."},"110":{"dur":1,"text":"We got there,"},"111":{"dur":1,"text":"and one of the first things I noticed"},"113":{"dur":3,"text":"was that the other kids' hair\nwas several shades of blonde,"},"116":{"dur":2,"text":"and most of them had blue eyes."},"119":{"dur":2,"text":"Meanwhile, this is what we looked like."},"123":{"dur":3,"text":"The first night, the camp director\ngathered everyone around the campfire"},"127":{"dur":1,"text":"and said,"},"128":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Kids, we have a very\ninternational camp this year;"},"132":{"dur":2,"text":"the Atencios are here from Venezuela.\""},"134":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"135":{"dur":3,"text":"The other kids looked at us\nas if we were from another planet."},"139":{"dur":1,"text":"They would ask us things

they were not trying to be mean;"},"154":{"dur":2,"text":"they were just trying\nto understand who we were,"},"157":{"dur":2,"text":"and make a correlation\nwith the world they knew."},"160":{"dur":1,"text":"We could either be like them,"},"161":{"dur":3,"text":"or like characters out of a book\nfilled with adventures,"},"164":{"dur":2,"text":"like Aladdin or the Jungle Book."},"167":{"dur":1,"text":"We certainly didn't look like them,"},"169":{"dur":1,"text":"we didn't speak their language,"},"171":{"dur":1,"text":"we were different."},"172":{"dur":2,"text":"When you're seven years old, that hurts."},"175":{"dur":2,"text":"But I had my little sister\nto take care of,"},"178":{"dur":2,"text":"and she cried every day at summer camp."},"181":{"dur":2,"text":"So I decided to put on a brave face,"},"183":{"dur":3,"text":"and embrace everything I could\nabout the American way of life."},"188":{"dur":3,"text":"We later did what we called\n\"the summer camp experiment,\""},"191":{"dur":4,"text":"for eight years in different cities\nthat many Americans haven't even heard of."},"197":{"dur":4,"text":"What I remember most about these moments\nwas when I finally clicked with someone."},"202":{"dur":3,"text":"Making a friend was a special reward."},"206":{"dur":2,"text":"Everybody wants to feel\nvalued and accepted,"},"208":{"dur":3,"text":"and we think it should happen\nspontaneously, but it doesn't."},"213":{"dur":3,"text":"When you're different,\nyou have to work at belonging."},"217":{"dur":3,"text":"You have to be either\nreally helpful,

me"},"251":{"dur":3,"text":"that my assigned roommate\nis eagerly waiting."},"255":{"dur":1,"text":"I opened the door,"},"256":{"dur":2,"text":"and there she was, sitting on the bed,"},"259":{"dur":1,"text":"with a headscarf."},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"Her name was Fatima,\nand she was Muslim from Bahrain,"},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"and she was not what I expected."},"268":{"dur":2,"text":"She probably sensed my disappointment\nwhen I looked at her"},"271":{"dur":2,"text":"because I didn't do too much to hide it."},"274":{"dur":2,"text":"See, as a teenager,\nI wanted to fit in even more,"},"277":{"dur":2,"text":"I wanted to be popular,"},"279":{"dur":2,"text":"maybe have a boyfriend for prom,"},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"and I felt that Fatima just got in the way"},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"with her shyness\nand her strict dress code."},"289":{"dur":2,"text":"I didn't realize\nthat I was making her feel"},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"like the kids at summer camp made me feel."},"294":{"dur":2,"text":"This was the high school\nequivalent of asking her,"},"297":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Do you know what a hamburger is?\""},"300":{"dur":2,"text":"I was consumed by my own selfishness"},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"and unable to put myself in her shoes."},"306":{"dur":1,"text":"I have to be honest with you,"},"308":{"dur":2,"text":"we only lasted a couple\nof months together,"},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"because she was later sent\nto live with a counselor"},"314":{"dur":1,"text":"instead of other students."},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"I remember thinking, \"Ah, she'll be okay."},"319":{"dur":1,"text":"She's just different.\""},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"You see, when we label\nsomeone as different,"},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"it dehumanizes them in a way."},"326":{"dur":1,"text":"They become \"the other.\""},"327":{"dur":3,"text":"They're not worthy of our time,\nnot our problem,"},"331":{"dur":5,"text":"and in fact, they, \"the other,\"\nare probably the cause of our problems."},"337":{"dur":2,"text":"So, how do we recognize our blind spots?"},"340":{"dur":4,"text":"It begins by understanding\nwhat makes you different,"},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"by embracing those traits."},"347":{"dur":4,"text":"Only then can you begin to appreciate\nwhat makes others special."},"352":{"dur":1,"text":"I remember when this hit me."},"354":{"dur":2,"text":"It was a couple months after that."},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"I had found that boyfriend for prom,"},"358":{"dur":1,"text":"made a group of friends,"},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"and practically forgotten about Fatima,"},"362":{"dur":4,"text":"until everybody signed on to participate\nin this talent show for charity."},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"You needed to offer a talent for auction."},"370":{"dur":3,"text":"It seemed like everybody\nhad something special to offer."},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"Some kids were going to play the violin,"},"376":{"dur":2,"text":"others were going to recite\na theater monologue,"},"379":{"dur":1,"text":"and I remember thinking,"},"381":{"dur":2,"text":"\"We don't practice talents\nlike these back home.\""},"384":{"dur":3,"text":"But I was determined\nto find something of value."},"387":{"dur":1,"text":"The day of the talent show comes,"},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"and I get up on stage\nwith my little boom box,"},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"and put it on the side and press \"Play,\""},"394":{"dur":4,"text":"and a song by my favorite\nemerging artist, Shakira, comes up."},"399":{"dur":5,"text":"And I go, \"Whenever, wherever,\nwe're meant to be together,\""},"404":{"dur":4,"text":"and I said, \"My name is Mariana,\nand I'm going to auction a dance class.\""},"410":{"dur":3,"text":"It seemed like the whole school\nraised their hand to bid."},"414":{"dur":1,"text":"My dance class really stood out"},"416":{"dur":3,"text":"from, like, the 10th violin class\noffered that day."},"419":{"dur":3,"text":"Going back to my dorm room,\nI didn't feel different."},"422":{"dur":1,"text":"I felt really special."},"424":{"dur":3,"text":"That's when I started\nthinking about Fatima,"},"428":{"dur":4,"text":"a person that I had failed to see\nas special, when I first met her."},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"She was from the Middle East,"},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"just like Shakira's family\nwas from the Middle East."},"437":{"dur":3,"text":"She could have probably taught me\na thing or two about belly dancing,"},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"had I been open to it."},"443":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, I want you all to take that sticker"},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"that was given to you \nat the beginning of our session today,"},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"where you wrote down\nwhat makes you special,"},"450":{"dur":1,"text":"and I want you to look at it."},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're watching at home,\ntake a piece of paper,"},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"and write down what makes you different."},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"You may feel guarded when you look at it,"},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"maybe even a little ashamed,\nmaybe even proud."},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"But you need to begin to embrace it."},"466":{"dur":5,"text":"Remember, it is the first step\nin appreciating what makes others special."},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"When I went back home to Venezuela,"},"475":{"dur":4,"text":"I began to understand\nhow these experiences were changing me."},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"Being able to speak different languages,"},"482":{"dur":3,"text":"to navigate all these\ndifferent people and places,"},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"it gave me a unique sensibility."},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"I was finally

others,\""},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"I wanted to do something to change that."},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"It was right around the time, however,"},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"when the Venezuelan government shut down"},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"the biggest television station\nin our country."},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"Censorship was growing,"},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"and my dad came up to me\nonce again and

me."},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"That's what he had been preparing me for."},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"That is what the future held for me."},"537":{"dur":5,"text":"So in 2008, I packed my bags,\nand I came to the United States,"},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"without a return ticket this time."},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"I was painfully aware\nthat, at 24 years old,"},"550":{"dur":5,"text":"I was becoming a

night."},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"When it became apparent\nthat Donald Trump was winning,"},"705":{"dur":3,"text":"this eight-year-old girl named Angelina\nrushed up to me in
