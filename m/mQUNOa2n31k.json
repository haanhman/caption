think,"},"817":{"dur":1,"text":"one of the leading issues of the day,"},"819":{"dur":3,"text":"and it encapsulates so many issues"},"822":{"dur":3,"text":"about not just criminal\njustice, but justice overall,"},"826":{"dur":2,"text":"and not just the criminal justice system,"},"828":{"dur":1,"text":"but the legal system, and not just"},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"people's connection to the

about"},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"- Sure.\n- what exactly the issue is."},"861":{"dur":0,"text":"I think the issue, and the issue"},"862":{"dur":1,"text":"looks different to different people"},"864":{"dur":1,"text":"because we all come from different places"},"866":{"dur":1,"text":"and we have different perspectives,"},"867":{"dur":0,"text":"but you're right."},"868":{"dur":1,"text":"The day I was sworn in,"},"869":{"dur":1,"text":"was the day of Freddie Gray's funeral,"},"871":{"dur":3,"text":"and that was the first night\nof violence in Baltimore."},"874":{"dur":1,"text":"That was when things\nreally, really escalated."},"876":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact, the morning I was sworn in,"},"878":{"dur":1,"text":"and then, that afternoon,"},"880":{"dur":3,"text":"my first briefing with the\npresident was on that situation,"},"884":{"dur":1,"text":"after I met with my team on it."},"886":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, it has been an important issue,"},"889":{"dur":1,"text":"and I think it's been the lens,"},"890":{"dur":0,"text":"as I mentioned before,"},"891":{"dur":2,"text":"through which we're gonna\nsee so many other issues."},"893":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, for me, and particularly\nhaving been in New York,"},"896":{"dur":2,"text":"as you know, a diverse community,"},"899":{"dur":1,"text":"a lot of different issues there"},"900":{"dur":2,"text":"about policing, about community members,"},"902":{"dur":3,"text":"about the minority community,"},"906":{"dur":2,"text":"and when I went to\nBaltimore that second week,"},"908":{"dur":2,"text":"what struck me most was how,"},"912":{"dur":3,"text":"how separate people were in\nterms of their reactions."},"915":{"dur":3,"text":"People do see incidents\nvery, very differently,"},"918":{"dur":3,"text":"but how united they were in their goals,"},"921":{"dur":3,"text":"and everyone I met in\nBaltimore was, ultimately,"},"925":{"dur":2,"text":"after expressing a

that really began to frame"},"943":{"dur":1,"text":"how I looked at those\nissues, because I always felt"},"945":{"dur":3,"text":"that where you find the\nkind of common ground,"},"949":{"dur":2,"text":"and a common allegiance\nto something like that,"},"951":{"dur":2,"text":"then you can build communication"},"953":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's how I've tried to\nframe
