on\nvacation, or somewhere, you know, and you"},"117":{"dur":4,"text":"need to be able to look at your animal and\ndiagnose and decide, is it something that"},"121":{"dur":4,"text":"I can take care of

get into a lot of things."},"144":{"dur":2,"text":">>Chelsea Ballinger:\nOh yeah, definitely."},"146":{"dur":5,"text":"So yeah, whenever you are getting a new puppy,\nor a new dog, cat, whatever, you

whether that's, if you have to child-proof,\nlock your cabinet, or whatever, you definitely"},"163":{"dur":1,"text":"want to take precaution."},"164":{"dur":5,"text":"Whether it's like household

any rat bait that could\nbe around your house or in your garage or"},"178":{"dur":3,"text":"whatever, that's definitely important to keep\ncleaned up, too, so they can't get into it."},"182":{"dur":1,"text":">>Kelly Runyon:\nWhat are some foods?"},"183":{"dur":5,"text":"You know, I think all of us that have been\npet owners, we're very anxious to give our"},"189":{"dur":3,"text":"animals food around the house, but that's\nnot such a good idea."},"193":{"dur":1,"text":">>Chelsea Ballinger:\nRight, yeah."},"194":{"dur":6,"text":"So, we try to stay away from people food,\nfeeding dogs, and even cats, too."},"200":{"dur":5,"text":"But a lot of owners, a lot of pet owners think\nthat they need to feed their pets some extra"},"205":{"dur":1,"text":"treats."},"207":{"dur":7,"text":"So, foods to stay away from: grapes, raisins,\nchocolate is a big one, especially around"},"215":{"dur":6,"text":"like Christmastime or

pretty"},"227":{"dur":1,"text":"sick with that, so."},"228":{"dur":2,"text":">>Kelly Runyon:\nThere's also, and you mentioned a few at the"},"230":{"dur":4,"text":"beginning of the interview, that

know!"},"239":{"dur":2,"text":"I give out the vibe that I like animals."},"241":{"dur":1,"text":"And cold weather hazards."},"242":{"dur":6,"text":"So, let's talk about some of the warm weather\nhazards that you might, and you mentioned"},"248":{"dur":3,"text":"some, and you're welcome to repeat them, but\nsome of the others that people might not realize"},"252":{"dur":1,"text":"around the house."},"253":{"dur":4,"text":">>Chelsea Ballinger:\nYeah, so any type of like household cleaners,"},"257":{"dur":6,"text":"like I was saying, and also like citronella\ncandles that you leave, sit outside, they"},"264":{"dur":1,"text":"can't get into those."},"265":{"dur":5,"text":"It can make them pretty sick if they eat it\nor lick it or

outside."},"274":{"dur":1,"text":"Where are you going?"},"276":{"dur":1,"text":"sit down."},"277":{"dur":3,"text":"You don't want to leave them outside for too\nlong, and especially not without water on"},"280":{"dur":1,"text":"these hot days."},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"So, that's something to take into consideration,\nas well."},"284":{"dur":1,"text":">>Kelly Runyon:\nCold weather hazards?"},"286":{"dur":1,"text":"Like ice melt."},"287":{"dur":7,"text":"I tell you, and I've put it up, I had in my\ngarage just a bag of ice melt, and I noticed"},"295":{"dur":3,"text":"that the bag had ripped and some of the pellets\nhad gone on the garage floor."},"298":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's probably not a good thing."},"299":{"dur":2,"text":">>Chelsea Ballinger:\nIt's not a good thing for them to get into."},"301":{"dur":5,"text":"They do make pet safe ice melts now that you\ncan get."},"306":{"dur":4,"text":"But definitely, the regular stuff you don't\nwant them to get into."},"311":{"dur":5,"text":"And even, I don't know, I'd be pretty nervous\nletting them get into the pet friendly stuff."},"316":{"dur":4,"text":"And also, like anti-freeze, anti-freeze for\nsome reason tastes really good to dogs, for"},"320":{"dur":1,"text":"whatever reasons."},"321":{"dur":3,"text":"You want to make sure that that's not leaking\nin the garage or wherever they're going to"},"325":{"dur":1,"text":"be at, so."},"327":{"dur":4,"text":">>Kelly Runyon:\nMedications for humans, that's another, that's"},"331":{"dur":3,"text":"something else that people should consider\nputting up."},"335":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, if you have them on the counter,\nyour vanity, it's very easy for a dog like"},"339":{"dur":1,"text":"Charlie to pop up there."},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"So, do you want to talk about human medications?"},"343":{"dur":1,"text":">>Chelsea Ballinger:\nYeah."},"345":{"dur":4,"text":"So, human medications, some of them can be\nused for animals."},"349":{"dur":3,"text":"But usually, more often than not they cannot\nbe."},"353":{"dur":2,"text":"It's better to be safe than sorry."},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"You don't want to give your pets any kind\nof your medications."},"358":{"dur":3,"text":"You want to keep them locked up in a cabinet,\nlike we said earlier."},"362":{"dur":5,"text":"And keep them away from the medications as\nmuch as you possibly can."},"367":{"dur":6,"text":"It's just safer to not even let them get into,\nso, and not even give it to them, so."},"373":{"dur":4,"text":">>Kelly Runyon:\nSo, if your dog or, you know, cat, too, in"},"377":{"dur":6,"text":"an event gets into something, and you notice\nthat something is not right with your animal."},"384":{"dur":3,"text":"And you know, you want to act."},"387":{"dur":4,"text":"I think ti's, and you can probably attest\nto this, it's important first to know your"},"392":{"dur":1,"text":"pet's vital signs."},"393":{"dur":8,"text":"So, how do you go about checking your animal\nfor breathing, for heart rate, for, you know,"},"401":{"dur":1,"text":"for the important vital signs?"},"403":{"dur":4,"text":">>Chelsea Ballinger:\nYeah, so a good way to check, and I'll show"},"407":{"dur":1,"text":"you if he'll cooperate."},"409":{"dur":1,"text":"Down."},"410":{"dur":1,"text":"Good boy."},"411":{"dur":1,"text":"You can always check their color."},"412":{"dur":4,"text":"So, a lot of times with like rat poisons and\nstuff like that, that messes with the vitamin"},"417":{"dur":3,"text":"K and their coagulation factors and stuff."},"421":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, when you lift up their lip, you see\ntheir gums, and you want them to be nice and"},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"pink."},"426":{"dur":5,"text":"Sometimes when they get into rat bait or something\nelse that's going to mess up their blood circulation,"},"431":{"dur":1,"text":"they'll be super white under there."},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"So, that's a good way to check."},"435":{"dur":4,"text":"Breathing, you can watch their chest for respiration\nrate."},"439":{"dur":4,"text":"We have stethoscopes that we use to listen\nto their heart and see how their heart and"},"443":{"dur":1,"text":"lungs both sound."},"445":{"dur":4,"text":"People, I mean, won't have stethoscopes at\nhome, so you might not be able to do that."},"449":{"dur":5,"text":"But you can definitely watch for respiration\nrates by watching their chest move up and"},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"down."},"456":{"dur":3,"text":"And temperature, if you have a thermometer\nat home that you can use, that you use strictly"},"459":{"dur":4,"text":"for your animals, you can always take their\ntemperature and see where they're at, especially"},"463":{"dur":6,"text":"if it's like hyperthermia or hypothermia case\nwhere they're really cold or really hot."},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"That's another good way to tell."},"471":{"dur":1,"text":"Hey, here."},"472":{"dur":1,"text":"Sit."},"473":{"dur":2,"text":">>Kelly Runyon:\nI think Charlie's probably, he said \"I'm tired"},"476":{"dur":1,"text":"of being checked over.\""},"478":{"dur":6,"text":"[laughs]\nSo, again, if, once you kind of recognize"},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"that there is something wrong, do you write\ndown all of that information?"},"488":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean, what, are statistics the same for\nhumans as they are for animals?"},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"And should you write all that down in the\nevent that when you take it to your vet, you've"},"496":{"dur":1,"text":"got all that information for them?"},"497":{"dur":5,"text":">>Chelsea Ballinger:\nIf it is a serious, like life or death situation,"},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"I say your best bet is to probably call the\nvet and say, I'm going to head over to the"},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"clinic, meet me there because it's a serious\nsituation."},"510":{"dur":5,"text":"If it's something where they might have a\ncut on their foot or something like that,"},"515":{"dur":5,"text":"where you can get the bleeding stopped and\nget them kind of where they're stable enough"},"520":{"dur":4,"text":"to take them into the vet's office, it's fine\nto go ahead and take their temperature, respiration"},"525":{"dur":1,"text":"rate, stuff like that."},"526":{"dur":1,"text":"And if you want to write it down, you can."},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"Otherwise, just remember it."},"529":{"dur":3,"text":"If they ask you whenever you get there, you\ncan tell them, so."},"532":{"dur":3,"text":">>Kelly Runyon:\nWhat are some common situations that require"},"535":{"dur":1,"text":"first aid?"},"537":{"dur":5,"text":"I know that there's a laundry list, and there's\nprobably, you know, a dozen that are pretty"},"542":{"dur":2,"text":"common that we should probably talk about."},"544":{"dur":1,"text":">>Chelsea Ballinger:\nYeah."},"545":{"dur":1,"text":">>Kelly Runyon:\nBleedings probably tops the list."},"547":{"dur":1,"text":">>Chelsea Runyon:\nDefinitely."},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah, definitely."},"549":{"dur":4,"text":"And I had a situation just this past year\nwith Charles here."},"554":{"dur":3,"text":"He decided to cut the bottom of his paw on\nsomething."},"557":{"dur":5,"text":"And it was right around finals time, of course,\nso I'm super stressed with finals."},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"But, and I couldn't get it to stop bleeding\nfor the longest time."},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"And I finally decided that if I couldn't get\nit stopped in the next 10 minutes, we're going"},"570":{"dur":1,"text":"to the E.R."},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"But eventually, I got it to stop bleeding,\nand it was fine."},"574":{"dur":4,"text":"And we took him the next day to the vet clinic\nand got it sewed up, and he was alright."},"579":{"dur":4,"text":"But even just situations, like if they eat\nsomething they shouldn't."},"584":{"dur":5,"text":"So, whether that's chocolate, grapes, raisins,\nsome of the stuff that we mentioned earlier,"},"589":{"dur":3,"text":"any of that stuff, that can be an emergency\nsituation."},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"Especially if they eat it in a large amount."},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"And even, just things like seizures."},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"A lot of people have dogs that have seizures."},"601":{"dur":4,"text":"And if it's the first one that they've ever\nseen their pet have, that can be super scary."},"606":{"dur":1,"text":">>Kelly Runyon:\nit's very scary."},"608":{"dur":1,"text":"I've been a part of that."},"609":{"dur":1,"text":"So, what do you do?"},"611":{"dur":5,"text":"I think in my situation, you're just very\nupset, and you don't know what to do."},"616":{"dur":3,"text":">>Chelsea Ballinger:\nYeah, so in that situation, you want to keep"},"619":{"dur":1,"text":"them as calm as possible."},"621":{"dur":6,"text":"Seizures can be really variable in dogs, so\nthey can show different signs and symptoms"},"627":{"dur":5,"text":"depending on what kind of seizure they're\nhaving and how long that it goes on and everything"},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"like that."},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"But the best thing is to keep them as quiet\nas possible."},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"You don't want to put your hands up towards\ntheir face, because you don't want to get"},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"bitten."},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"And a lot of times, they're not aware of what's\ngoing on whenever they're having a seizure,"},"647":{"dur":6,"text":"so you want to be sure and keep your hands\naway from their face and stuff while they're"},"653":{"dur":1,"text":"having the seizure."},"654":{"dur":4,"text":"And then, the best way to do that, you can\ntake them in, have your vet look them over,"},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"make sure that they're doing okay."},"660":{"dur":1,"text":">>Kelly Runyon:\nCharlie!"},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"I do like you, but we're getting a little...\n[laughs]"},"664":{"dur":1,"text":">>Chelsea Ballinger:\nSit."},"666":{"dur":2,"text":">>Kelly Runyon:\nOh, Charles."},"668":{"dur":1,"text":"Getting a little rambunctious."},"670":{"dur":1,"text":">>Chelsea Ballinger:\nUh huh."},"672":{"dur":3,"text":"But yeah, you can take them into your vet,\nget them checked over the next day, make sure"},"675":{"dur":1,"text":"everything's okay."},"676":{"dur":3,"text":"And then, after that they usually tell you\nto keep a journal or write it on the calendar."},"680":{"dur":3,"text":"Because sometimes, a dog or a cat can have\na seizure, and they don't have another one"},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"for like a year or two later."},"687":{"dur":3,"text":"And you don't want to start them on medication\nuntil it's like a consistent thing, so."},"690":{"dur":3,"text":">>Kelly Runyon:\nWhat about vomiting, or if their stomach starts"},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"to bloat?"},"695":{"dur":5,"text":"Or something along those lines where, you\nknow, you think vomiting might be something"},"701":{"dur":4,"text":"that happens frequently with dogs, but it\ncould be something more."},"706":{"dur":1,"text":">>Chelsea Ballinger:\nRight."},"707":{"dur":4,"text":"With vomiting, you can have, so many different\nproblems can cause vomiting."},"712":{"dur":4,"text":"Whether that's liver and kidney function,\nwhether that's a foreign body, if they've"},"716":{"dur":1,"text":"eaten something."},"717":{"dur":5,"text":"Labs are notorious for eating toys, or socks,\nor anything that they can find."},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"And that can cause vomiting a lot of times."},"725":{"dur":3,"text":"And sometimes, you know, it's just kind of\nlike a stress colitis."},"729":{"dur":3,"text":"They get stressed out about something, and\nit causes them to vomit."},"733":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's all that it is."},"734":{"dur":7,"text":"But you never want to be, you never want to\njust assume that it's something simple, and"},"741":{"dur":1,"text":"that it's going to cure itself."},"743":{"dur":3,"text":"Because, vomiting can be a pretty severe thing."},"747":{"dur":1,"text":">>Kelly Runyon:\nAnd so can heat stroke."},"748":{"dur":1,"text":">>Chelsea Ballinger:\nRight."},"749":{"dur":2,"text":">>Kelly Runyon:\nLet's talk about that."},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"What causes the heat stroke in dogs, and if\nyou notice, you know, maybe you do have an"},"756":{"dur":4,"text":"outside dog, and you've taken all the precautions\nthat you should."},"760":{"dur":3,"text":"But if you notice some of the symptoms that\nyou notice."},"764":{"dur":4,"text":"And what can a person do to help get their\npet's body temperature back to where it should"},"768":{"dur":1,"text":"be?"},"769":{"dur":1,"text":">>Chelsea Ballinger:\nYeah, especially on these hot days that we've"},"771":{"dur":1,"text":"had."},"773":{"dur":1,"text":"Sit."},"775":{"dur":1,"text":"Sit."},"776":{"dur":2,"text":"On these hot days that we've had these summer."},"778":{"dur":4,"text":"It's super important to make sure they have\nplenty of water when they're outside."},"783":{"dur":4,"text":"And we're going to give him some treats so\nhe'll cooperate."},"787":{"dur":5,"text":"And so, you also want to make sure, like,\nwhenever you go out, you want to check on"},"793":{"dur":3,"text":"your dog as much as you possibly can."},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"But sometimes, you know, people leave for\nwork, and they're gone for the day, and they"},"800":{"dur":2,"text":"don't get back until later in the evening."},"802":{"dur":6,"text":"So, you want to be sure and, if you go out\nand find your dog, a lot of times when they're"},"808":{"dur":3,"text":"too hot, they'll just be laying out flat on\ntheir sides."},"812":{"dur":6,"text":"They won't really respond, depending on how\nhot they actually get."},"818":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, you want to get them cooled down as\nsoon as you can."},"821":{"dur":3,"text":"So, whether that's hosing them down, if that's\nthrowing them in the bathtub."},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, get them cooled down as soon as\nyou can."},"828":{"dur":4,"text":"That's another situation where you're having\na thermometer and taking their temperature,"},"832":{"dur":3,"text":"and seeing where they're at, so that way you\ncan see where they're at as soon as you get"},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"home and how much that drops."},"837":{"dur":1,"text":"And especially--\n>>Kelly Runyon:"},"838":{"dur":4,"text":"When you put them in the bath, it's my understanding\nyou shouldn't put them in ice cold water."},"842":{"dur":3,"text":"You should have it in lukewarm water to help\nwith that."},"845":{"dur":1,"text":">>Chelsea Ballinger:\nExactly."},"846":{"dur":3,"text":"Yeah, you don't want to cool them down too\nfast, but you want to get them to where their"},"850":{"dur":2,"text":"body temperature gets down."},"852":{"dur":6,"text":"So, it's kind of a sketchy situation, because\nyou want to get them cooled down, but you"},"859":{"dur":1,"text":"don't want to do it too fast, so."},"860":{"dur":2,"text":">>Kelly Runyon:\nThree others that come to mind, as far as"},"863":{"dur":7,"text":"something that could happen to pet owners\nat home, would be limping, stings, bee stings,"},"870":{"dur":2,"text":"wasp stings, and choking."},"873":{"dur":5,"text":"So, why don't you address those, if that is\nsomething that happens to someone at home."},"878":{"dur":4,"text":">>Chelsea Ballinger:\nYeah, limping, so limping can be caused by"},"882":{"dur":1,"text":"numerous different things."},"884":{"dur":4,"text":"Sometimes if they've pulled a muscle or something\nin their leg."},"888":{"dur":4,"text":"A lot of, other times it could be they have\nsomething stuck up in their paw pad, you know."},"893":{"dur":6,"text":"Just, you want to kind of take their leg gently\nand see, just look, start at the bottom and"},"900":{"dur":1,"text":"work your way up."},"901":{"dur":2,"text":"So, if you start at the bottom, you don't\nsee anything in the paw pad, you can kind"},"904":{"dur":1,"text":"of work your way up."},"905":{"dur":4,"text":"And a lot of times, you can feel joints, and\nif the joints feel hotter than normal, that"},"909":{"dur":4,"text":"can be a sign that there's something going\non there."},"913":{"dur":4,"text":"And then, you'd want to take them, if it continues,\nyou'd want to take them into the vet and get"},"917":{"dur":3,"text":"them checked over, and make sure they don't\nhave a broken bone or something."},"920":{"dur":3,"text":"They can take X-rays to rule that out."},"923":{"dur":4,"text":">>Kelly Runyon:\nIs it something you should, you know, set"},"927":{"dur":1,"text":"when you're at home?"},"928":{"dur":2,"text":"Like make sure it's stabilized at home?"},"931":{"dur":1,"text":"Is that something that you should do?"},"932":{"dur":3,"text":">>Chelsea Ballinger:\nYeah, I mean, if it's broken, like if they,"},"936":{"dur":4,"text":"say they get hit by a car or something, they're\ngoing to be in shock for a while."},"940":{"dur":4,"text":"So, you want to be really careful, because\na lot of times it can be super painful."},"945":{"dur":5,"text":"Sometimes you don't necessarily want to mess\nwith it too much, because then they could"},"950":{"dur":2,"text":"try to bite you or whatever just because it\nhurts so bad."},"953":{"dur":6,"text":"So, you kind of have to know your own pet\na little bit, and know what's happened."},"959":{"dur":3,"text":"And, like if you know that they've been hit\nby a car, and it's super painful, then you"},"963":{"dur":1,"text":"probably don't want to mess with it much."},"964":{"dur":3,"text":"If you think that it's something where they\njust kind of, they were running around in"},"968":{"dur":4,"text":"the yard, and they tweaked a muscle or something,\nthen it's okay to kind of feel around on it"},"973":{"dur":1,"text":"and see what's going on."},"974":{"dur":1,"text":">>Kelly Runyon:\nWhat about stings?"},"976":{"dur":5,"text":"I had a black lab at one time in my life,\nand they were stung by something; I don't"},"981":{"dur":1,"text":"know what it was."},"982":{"dur":4,"text":"But in the middle of the night, her head swelled\nup."},"986":{"dur":2,"text":"and I was, oh my gosh, what's wrong?"},"989":{"dur":4,"text":"So, that can be something that could be a\npretty serious situation."},"994":{"dur":2,"text":"And other times, it's just like if we get\nstung by a bee."},"996":{"dur":6,"text":"You put an ointment or baking soda and water\non the area."},"1002":{"dur":4,"text":"What should you do if you think, you witnessed\nyour animal being stung?"},"1006":{"dur":3,"text":">>Chelsea Ballinger:\nYeah, so if you have seen, like seen them"},"1010":{"dur":3,"text":"get stung, you know that they've gotten stung,\nif they're breaking out in
