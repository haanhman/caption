didn't\nrealize how big the field was, but also they"},"370":{"dur":1,"text":"didn't have the tools."},"371":{"dur":4,"text":"And that sounded very familiar to us because\nwe had been addressing these

went."},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"I came back about nine months later on a combat."},"522":{"dur":3,"text":"And there was a pile of junk in the corner\nof the laboratory."},"525":{"dur":5,"text":"And

of the great things that we can do is\nwe can make nanofibers out of proteins."},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"We weren't talking about just any proteins."},"570":{"dur":4,"text":"It turns out that when you do a surgery on\na baby inside the womb, when the baby is born,"},"574":{"dur":5,"text":"there is no scar because there is a certain\nclass of proteins that causes a scarless wound"},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"healing in the baby."},"581":{"dur":5,"text":"And so we figured, hey, listen, if we can\ntake these same proteins and we can make nanofibers,"},"586":{"dur":4,"text":"can we make wound dressings out of these proteins\nin such a way that we don't have these debilitating"},"590":{"dur":6,"text":"scars that can heal faster, less infections\nand they will also get hair regrowth?"},"597":{"dur":1,"text":"So it turned out that we did."},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"We were able to do that."},"599":{"dur":4,"text":"And the early animal

look at the histology, you can see"},"607":{"dur":1,"text":"that we are getting hair follicles early on."},"609":{"dur":1,"text":"The wounds are closed with no infection."},"610":{"dur":4,"text":"The whole idea is to develop a set of wound\ndressings so we can take this beautiful child"},"614":{"dur":5,"text":"and make her fell as good about herself as\nwe feel about

there."},"627":{"dur":4,"text":"And one of the reasons why is because the\nArmy had made this decision that they were"},"632":{"dur":4,"text":"going to make one camouflage pattern that\nwas going to be good for all environments."},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"How many of you have ever used a universal\ntool?"},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"A tool that's good for everything?"},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"Your

that."},"657":{"dur":1,"text":"That doesn't fit in there."},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"And so I started thinking about camouflage."},"659":{"dur":3,"text":"This was a $1 billion mistake made by the\nU.S. Army."},"663":{"dur":4,"text":"And right after October 1st, you are going\nto see the announcement of another camouflage"},"668":{"dur":1,"text":"pattern that they are going to replace this."},"669":{"dur":1,"text":"They had Congressional hearings about this."},"670":{"dur":1,"text":"This was bad."},"671":{"dur":3,"text":"I was only slightly less conspicuous than\nif I had a road flare duct taped to my forehead"},"674":{"dur":1,"text":"out there."},"675":{"dur":4,"text":"And it turned out that all of the services\nhad decided with all their flush -- all the"},"680":{"dur":3,"text":"flush money they had from the war on terror\nthat they were going to develop all different"},"683":{"dur":4,"text":"camouflage patterns so now every service has\ntheir own camouflage pattern."},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"So there is a couple things that you see right\naway here."},"691":{"dur":5,"text":"First of all, that there is -- obviously the\nsame science is not behind all these camouflage"},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"patterns."},"697":{"dur":4,"text":"And second of all, some of these services\nare making a fashion statement in their camouflage"},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"pattern."},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"And I would argue that if the objective of\nthe camouflage is to not be seen, that's the"},"706":{"dur":3,"text":"inverse problem of fashion, which is to be\nseen and make a statement."},"709":{"dur":5,"text":"So you are seeing a pretty serious mistake\nhere, and it's cost you a lot of money."},"715":{"dur":4,"text":"I say \"my Army\" when I am a proud of it, but\nit is \"your Army\" when I'm not."},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"And it was \"your Army\" that made this, this\ndecision."},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"So we started this effort at Harvard."},"726":{"dur":4,"text":"It turns out that, you know, nature does natural\ncamouflage all the time."},"730":{"dur":3,"text":"Cephalopods, cuttlefish, octopus, squids,\nthey have natural coloration changes."},"734":{"dur":1,"text":"They can adapt to their environment."},"736":{"dur":3,"text":"So that means there is no physical laws against\nadaptive camouflage."},"740":{"dur":4,"text":"And it turns out that these sea creatures\nhave these very unique bionanophotonic structures"},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"in their skin that allow them to adapt into\nany type of environment."},"747":{"dur":5,"text":"And at the same time, I started teaching classes\nin fashion design at the engineering school."},"752":{"dur":1,"text":"You can imagine how well that went over."},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"Let me tell you a funny story about this."},"756":{"dur":7,"text":"I called a neuroscientist at Harvard to ask\nher to help us teach this fashion class."},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"And she said, What do a bunch of guys know\nabout fashion?"},"766":{"dur":3,"text":"I said, Well, first of all, men know a lot\nabout fashion."},"770":{"dur":2,"text":"Second of all, we have female engineers at\nHarvard."},"773":{"dur":6,"text":"[ Applause ]\n>>Kevin Kit Parker: Maybe not other places."},"779":{"dur":3,"text":"We started teaching this class and started\nmaking models or demos."},"782":{"dur":3,"text":"The whole idea was to make fashions that were\nbigger than the garment."},"785":{"dur":1,"text":"We put sensors in them."},"786":{"dur":1,"text":"We put light sources."},"788":{"dur":1,"text":"We put fiberoptics."},"789":{"dur":3,"text":"The whole idea, to start to understand what\nit would be like to instrument a clothing"},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"item."},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"And what we did was on the cuttlefish -- in\nthe meantime, with the cuttlefish, what we"},"798":{"dur":5,"text":"did was we reverse engineered these nanophotonic\nstructures that you see in their skin."},"803":{"dur":4,"text":"We found out it is this really -- this collective\nnetwork of proteins that allow you to modulate"},"808":{"dur":1,"text":"light."},"809":{"dur":1,"text":"They fluoresce."},"810":{"dur":1,"text":"They reflect light."},"811":{"dur":1,"text":"They absorb light."},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"Then we went back to our cotton candy machine\nafter we had extracted these proteins and"},"815":{"dur":1,"text":"we started building these things into fibers."},"816":{"dur":4,"text":"And now the whole idea is we want to make\ntextiles that have these same types of photonic"},"820":{"dur":4,"text":"structures that you see in a cuttlefish so\nI can have that adaptive camouflage."},"825":{"dur":5,"text":"Really what I want to do is have an invisible\nsuit when I am getting chased by someone with"},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"a honey-do list."},"831":{"dur":3,"text":"[ Laughter ]\n>>Kevin Kit Parker: So the thing that bothered"},"835":{"dur":3,"text":"me the most about the war was the way we were\nfighting."},"838":{"dur":4,"text":"So we have an entire military and defensive\nindustrial complex which is predicated on"},"843":{"dur":3,"text":"the assumption that war is an acute event."},"847":{"dur":4,"text":"And in that model of warfare, the primary\nobjective is to kill people and break things."},"851":{"dur":5,"text":"But we're fighting in third world countries\nand in cultures where war is a chronic condition."},"857":{"dur":2,"text":"And we're fighting counterinsurgency."},"860":{"dur":4,"text":"And so the primary objective of counterinsurgency\nis not to kick a door and break down things"},"864":{"dur":1,"text":"and kill people."},"865":{"dur":2,"text":"It is to go in and make a friend."},"868":{"dur":2,"text":"You go in and you make a friend."},"870":{"dur":3,"text":"And your friend either leads you to the enemy\nor you empower that friend to go find their"},"873":{"dur":3,"text":"enemy and get rid of them."},"876":{"dur":4,"text":"This is important because insurgents, bad\npeople, they live off the passive support"},"881":{"dur":1,"text":"of the good people."},"882":{"dur":1,"text":"They get right up close."},"883":{"dur":3,"text":"Your primary objective when you are doing\ncounterinsurgency is to peel

their\nbutt off."},"1166":{"dur":1,"text":"We came in."},"1167":{"dur":4,"text":"We developed a whole set of analytics to analyze\nthis neighborhood, everything from

got to be really quick here."},"1214":{"dur":3,"text":"Remember I told you at the beginning that\nI was interested in heart."},"1218":{"dur":3,"text":"So all of this time I am doing all this war\nscience, I was still thinking about the heart"},"1222":{"dur":1,"text":"in the back of my mind."},"1223":{"dur":2,"text":"And I really wanted to make a big advance."},"1225":{"dur":1,"text":"Very frustrated with the way we treated heart\ndisease."},"1226":{"dur":1,"text":"I decided, I said, Hey, listen."},"1228":{"dur":2,"text":"What I got do is I got to flank the problem\nbecause I don't want

pump."},"1240":{"dur":2,"text":"And, you know, I can build that."},"1243":{"dur":4,"text":"So the whole idea was, hey, what if one of\nthe reasons why we're not good at solving"},"1247":{"dur":3,"text":"heart disease is because we don't understand\nthe fundamental laws of muscular pumps."},"1251":{"dur":1,"text":"What if that's the problem?"},"1252":{"dur":4,"text":"And any engineer will tell you if you try\nto build something, you can usually learn"},"1256":{"dur":1,"text":"something about it."},"1257":{"dur":3,"text":"And you start to take a look at the spatial\nscales of the jellyfish and the heart."},"1260":{"dur":3,"text":"They are not very similar until you get to\nthe subcellular level."},"1264":{"dur":1,"text":"So we had this idea."},"1265":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's study the jellyfish."},"1266":{"dur":3,"text":"When we studied the jellyfish, what we found\nwas electrically and mechanically it behaves"},"1270":{"dur":3,"text":"just like the heart, just like the heart."},"1273":{"dur":4,"text":"So we took the jellyfish and we made a map\nof where every cell was in the jellyfish."},"1277":{"dur":5,"text":"And then we took a rat apart and we built\nit cell by cell as a jellyfish."},"1283":{"dur":4,"text":"So we took the stem cell technology I told\nyou about, the outer coating of a breast implant,"},"1287":{"dur":5,"text":"we took a map -- a template for the map of\nwhere all the cells were in the jellyfish"},"1292":{"dur":2,"text":"and we built it onto this polymer thin film."},"1295":{"dur":5,"text":"Then we took the rat cells and put them down\non there, and they self-organized into a muscular"},"1300":{"dur":3,"text":"structure that looks very much like the jellyfish."},"1303":{"dur":1,"text":"We matched it almost precisely."},"1304":{"dur":4,"text":"These are the rat cells coming down onto the\nmap of where the jellyfish muscle cells were."},"1309":{"dur":6,"text":"They self-organized, formed a tissue."},"1316":{"dur":3,"text":"This is what we built."},"1320":{"dur":1,"text":"This is what the jellyfish was."},"1321":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the jellyfish architecture, so we\nare pretty close."},"1324":{"dur":4,"text":"We quantified it using fingerprint software\nthat we got from a law enforcement agency."},"1329":{"dur":4,"text":"We put it in a bucket of saltwater and put\na pacemaker in there."},"1333":{"dur":1,"text":"You can see the heart cells beating there."},"1335":{"dur":1,"text":"Those are rat cells."},"1336":{"dur":6,"text":"What you are seeing here is the jellyfish,\nwhich is going to take its first swim strokes,"},"1342":{"dur":2,"text":"it is a little bit awkward when it starts\nout."},"1345":{"dur":4,"text":"We are peeling it off of the substrate there."},"1349":{"dur":1,"text":"These are the first swim strokes of this jellyfish."},"1351":{"dur":6,"text":"And it is

this?"},"1372":{"dur":1,"text":"Why did we do this?"},"1373":{"dur":1,"text":"Because I want to be called Frankenstein?"},"1375":{"dur":1,"text":"No."},"1376":{"dur":1,"text":"This is a training exercise."},"1377":{"dur":1,"text":"I want to build a heart, right?"},"1378":{"dur":2,"text":"I want to replace hearts in patients that\nneed them."},"1380":{"dur":1,"text":"But I needed to build a
