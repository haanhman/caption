At the front"},"441":{"dur":4,"text":"of the crane all four axles are linked together,\nand it is a model engineering challenge to"},"445":{"dur":6,"text":"get all four axles to steer, and steer proportionately.\nMoving out on to the test track and the crane"},"452":{"dur":4,"text":"rolls along well in a straight line. All of\nthe tyres are properly grounded and each of"},"456":{"dur":4,"text":"the axles holds its position. Let's now give\nit a test of the steering and the four front"},"461":{"dur":5,"text":"axles are linked together, as are the two\nrear axles, and with that the crane is able"},"466":{"dur":4,"text":"to follow a shallow curve. There are some\nvery small working features on the carrier"},"471":{"dur":5,"text":"and that includes fold-down access ladders,\nand the cover on the control console for the"},"476":{"dur":5,"text":"outriggers also opens. With the access ladders\ndown, we can begin to set up the crane, and"},"482":{"dur":5,"text":"we'll start by unloading the outrigger pads.\nWith the pads laid out we can then pull out"},"487":{"dur":7,"text":"the two-stage outrigger beams. and these can\nbe set at either 50% or 100% extension. The"},"494":{"dur":5,"text":"pistons just unscrew to reveal a smooth piston\nsurface, and another very nice touch on the"},"499":{"dur":4,"text":"model is that the pads are magnetic so they\nwill stick on to the pistons while you put"},"503":{"dur":5,"text":"in the spreader plates underneath. Another\nvery tiny detail is that locking pins are"},"508":{"dur":4,"text":"provided to be able to lock the extension\nof the outrigger beams. The whole outrigger"},"513":{"dur":5,"text":"arrangement is strong on the model because\nit will support the crane wheels-free. Next"},"519":{"dur":6,"text":"we can fire-up the crane and start by swinging\nthe cab into its operating position. Next"},"525":{"dur":4,"text":"we will take off the cover cap for the ram\nscrews, and then we can smoothly raise the"},"530":{"dur":6,"text":"boom into an operating position. Once it is\nthere it is locked into place with the screws."},"536":{"dur":4,"text":"The counterweight attaches to a secondary\nwinch assembly and to make that look a bit"},"540":{"dur":4,"text":"more realistic, we can add the thread that\nis left over on the spool and to do that we"},"544":{"dur":4,"text":"will tie the end on to the winch drum and\nthen wind all the thread on using some nifty"},"549":{"dur":5,"text":"wrist action, and that leaves us with the\nwinch drum looking more realistic. The winch"},"554":{"dur":5,"text":"assembly sits on top of the main counterweight\nplates, and it is secured in position using"},"559":{"dur":5,"text":"some more of the very tiny pins. Once it is\nfixed the real crane would turn around and"},"564":{"dur":4,"text":"pick up its counterweight but in the model\nworld you need to manually fit the counterweight"},"569":{"dur":5,"text":"on. To secure it there is another piece of\nmicro-model engineering combined with yet"},"574":{"dur":5,"text":"another small pin. Again this is all very\nhigh quality model engineering and it also"},"580":{"dur":5,"text":"includes connecting up some hydraulic lines\nto the main crane body. With the counterweight"},"585":{"dur":7,"text":"attached you can then load up with more blocks\nif you want. Another great detail to improve"},"593":{"dur":4,"text":"the look of the model is this piece which\ngoes in to the secondary winch assembly. For"},"598":{"dur":4,"text":"the next part we have detached the superlift\nassembly and we can telescope the boom. A"},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"great feature of the model is that it replicates\nthe locking pins that the real crane used"},"606":{"dur":4,"text":"to have, and they are spring-loaded and you\npull them out so you can raise the telescopic"},"610":{"dur":6,"text":"boom section. The model also accurately replicates\nthe real machine because it has boom locking"},"616":{"dur":7,"text":"holes at the 50% 92% and 100% extension positions.\nAnd here the crane is set up with all sections"},"624":{"dur":7,"text":"at the 50% boom lock. To open up the superlift\nyou use a special key in the superlift winch,"},"638":{"dur":4,"text":"and you carefully unwind it as you raise up\nthe superlift.

Well with the"},"658":{"dur":5,"text":"tape out it is about 42 inches or 107 centimetres.\nThere are plenty of other features on the"},"663":{"dur":5,"text":"model including opening driving cab doors,\nand the two covers for the engine in the carrier"},"669":{"dur":5,"text":"also open, and that lets you see a really\nnicely detailed metal engine. The crane cab"},"675":{"dur":5,"text":"also features a nice tilting mechanism, and\nit has also got a sliding door which works"},"680":{"dur":5,"text":"quite well too. But there is more because\nthere is opening engine covers on the crane"},"685":{"dur":3,"text":"and the silver heads that you can see are\nmagnets which are used to keep the covers"},"689":{"dur":7,"text":"shut in a closed position. Even the optional\ntoolbox at the rear has got opening doors."},"699":{"dur":5,"text":"In summary YCC has produced a very high quality\nprecision model.
