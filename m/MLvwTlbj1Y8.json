go."},"381":{"dur":2,"text":"And Jesse's a good crane operator,"},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"and he did okay by our standards."},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"He also required a revision surgery on his chest."},"388":{"dur":2,"text":"And that gave us the opportunity"},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"to do targeted reinnervation."},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"So my colleague, Dr. Greg Dumanian, did the surgery."},"395":{"dur":3,"text":"First, we cut away the nerve to his own muscle,"},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"then we took the arm nerves"},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"and just kind of had them shift down onto his chest"},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"and closed him up."},"404":{"dur":2,"text":"And after about three months,"},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"the nerves grew in a little bit and we could get a twitch."},"408":{"dur":3,"text":"And after six months, the nerves grew in well,"},"411":{"dur":2,"text":"and you could see strong contractions."},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is what it looks like."},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"This is what happens when Jesse thinks"},"417":{"dur":2,"text":"open and close his hand,"},"419":{"dur":3,"text":"or bend or straighten your elbow."},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"You can see the movements on his chest,"},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"and those little hash marks"},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"are where we put our antennae, or electrodes."},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"And I challenge anybody in the room"},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"to make their chest go like this."},"432":{"dur":2,"text":"His brain is thinking about his arm."},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"He has not learned how to do this with the chest."},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"There is not a learning process."},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"That's why it's intuitive."},"441":{"dur":3,"text":"So here's Jesse in our first little test with him."},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"On the left-hand side, you see his original prosthesis,"},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"and he's using those switches"},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"to move little blocks from one box to the other."},"451":{"dur":3,"text":"He's had that arm for about 20 months, so he's pretty good with it."},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"On the right side,"},"456":{"dur":3,"text":"two months after we fit him with his targeted reinnervation prosthesis --"},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"which, by the way, is the same physical arm,"},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"just programmed a little different --"},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"you can see that he's much faster"},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"and much smoother as he moves these little blocks."},"469":{"dur":3,"text":"And we're only able to use three of the signals at this time."},"472":{"dur":5,"text":"Then we had one of those little surprises in science."},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're all motivated to get motor commands"},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"to drive robotic arms."},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"And after a few months,"},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"you touch Jesse on his chest,"},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"and he felt his missing hand."},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"His hand sensation grew into his chest again"},"490":{"dur":3,"text":"probably because we had also taken away a lot of fat,"},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"so the skin was right down to the muscle"},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"and deinnervated, if you would, his skin."},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"So you touch Jesse here, he feels his thumb;"},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"you touch it here, he feels his pinky."},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"He feels light touch"},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"down to one gram of force."},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"He feels hot, cold, sharp, dull,"},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"all in his missing hand,"},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"or both his hand and his chest,"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"but he can attend to either."},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is really exciting for us,"},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"because now we have a portal,"},"518":{"dur":4,"text":"a portal, or a way to potentially give back sensation,"},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"so that he might feel what he touches"},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"with his prosthetic hand."},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"Imagine sensors in the hand"},"528":{"dur":3,"text":"coming up and pressing on this new hand skin."},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"So it was very exciting."},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"We've also gone on"},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"with what was initially our primary population"},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"of people with above-the-elbow amputations."},"539":{"dur":3,"text":"And here we deinnervate, or cut the nerve away,"},"542":{"dur":2,"text":"just from little segments of muscle"},"544":{"dur":2,"text":"and leave others alone"},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"that give us our up-down signals"},"548":{"dur":3,"text":"and two others that will give us a hand open and close signal."},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"This was one of our first patients, Chris."},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"You see him with his original device"},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"on the left there after eight months of use,"},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"and on the right, it is two months."},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"He's about four or five times as fast"},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"with this simple little performance metric."},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"All right."},"567":{"dur":3,"text":"So one of the best parts of my job"},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"is working with really great patients"},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"who are also our research

down"},"800":{"dur":3,"text":"and a few that I've borrowed from around the world."},"803":{"dur":3,"text":"It's about seven pounds,"},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"which is probably about what my arm would

Amanda, when you first started using this arm,"},"838":{"dur":3,"text":"how long did it take to use it?"},"841":{"dur":2,"text":"AK: It took just about probably three to four hours"},"843":{"dur":2,"text":"to get it to train."},"845":{"dur":2,"text":"I had to hook it up to a computer,"},"847":{"dur":2,"text":"so I couldn't just train it

minute."},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"TK: So we're really excited,"},"865":{"dur":3,"text":"because now we're getting to a clinically practical device."},"868":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's where our goal is
