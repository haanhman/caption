extremely,"},"299":{"dur":6,"text":"extremely careful about the role\nthat we play, who's feet we step on."},"305":{"dur":3,"text":"To the extent that we do something like,\nVisa Checkout, which is something which"},"309":{"dur":3,"text":"appears to be direct to consumer,\nthere has to be a good reason for it."},"312":{"dur":4,"text":">> Or, we have to be willing\nto take on our

this infrastructure."},"334":{"dur":5,"text":"We are a network, but we rely on\nnetworks to help deliver our products."},"340":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, we have to be really thoughtful\nabout what it means to go beyond that."},"344":{"dur":3,"text":"And so when we think about what happens\ntoday, I know, I mean it sounds very,"},"347":{"dur":4,"text":"very complicated when you draw, I mean\nmost

should that change,"},"379":{"dur":4,"text":"I personally think the basic\nstructure of that,"},"384":{"dur":5,"text":"is something that will be hard to\nchange at the scale that we do it."},"389":{"dur":3,"text":"They're absolutely people that can\nwin the Longtel transactions and"},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"do things that are very\ndifferent than that."},"395":{"dur":3,"text":"But

worlds."},"421":{"dur":4,"text":"And I guess you all stressed this question\na little bit about priorities and whatnot."},"425":{"dur":3,"text":"And they're three very distinct worlds,\nand we're not picking and"},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"choosing between the three,\nwe're dealing with all three."},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"Number one is,\nwe do have a traditional business,"},"434":{"dur":4,"text":"most of which is physical cards where\nwe deal with issuers and acquirers."},"438":{"dur":5,"text":"And we compete every single\nday with MasterCard,"},"443":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's going to be UnionPay in China,\nand it's local networks, and"},"447":{"dur":3,"text":"it's America Express on co-brands,\nand they're all tough competition."},"450":{"dur":1,"text":"And if you ask me how I spend my time,"},"452":{"dur":3,"text":"there's more significant portion\nof my time than you would expect,"},"456":{"dur":3,"text":"dealing with these big relationships,\nbecause that is our life blood today."},"460":{"dur":3,"text":"Second piece of it,\nis the developing world, right?"},"463":{"dur":4,"text":"And so,\nthere is a lot of dark space out there,"},"467":{"dur":5,"text":"which is huge opportunity for\nus and it's not just Africa."},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"It's parts of the United States."},"474":{"dur":3,"text":"In the United States, half the\ntransactions still aren't electronic here."},"478":{"dur":3,"text":"And yes, so the growth rates in the US\nare half of what they are in the rest of"},"482":{"dur":3,"text":"the world, but it's a lot of dollars for\nus to go after."},"486":{"dur":4,"text":"So the idea of continuing to penetrate\nelectronic payments of which there's."},"490":{"dur":3,"text":"When we went public in 2008, there was\nsomething like, my numbers will be"},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"a little bit wrong, 6 or 7 trillion\ndollars of cash in the world in commerce."},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"Today that number's 11 or 12, so there's\nmore cash today than there was when we"},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"went public, and\nwe have more to this than ever."},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"And so the third bucket is digital."},"506":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's what I said before which is,\nwe have to deliver our products and"},"510":{"dur":3,"text":"our

way,"},"518":{"dur":1,"text":"shape, or form."},"520":{"dur":4,"text":"And we have to be there where digital\ntransactions are taking place."},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's very different from\nwhat we've done in the past."},"527":{"dur":1,"text":">> So not everybody can win though,"},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"as we move from an industrial\nworld to the digital one."},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"And so in this new sort of restructuring,"},"533":{"dur":5,"text":"who do you think is under pressure in that\nvalue chain that we've talked about

that transaction\nshould be scared to death."},"562":{"dur":5,"text":"And you can look at whether it's the bank,\nwhether it is the network,"},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"whether it's the acquirer

something that we worry about"},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"in the next four or five years,\nbut absolutely beyond that."},"663":{"dur":5,"text":">> So if your customer and your kind of\nkey partner in this effort is the bank,"},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"but the consumer is the end user and"},"671":{"dur":4,"text":"you sort of are relying on them as\na channel, how do you deal with the

into?"},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"You said stepping on people's toes."},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"How do you deal with\nthat whole complexity?"},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"I guess, first and"},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"foremost, the resources-\n>> And,"},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"most importantly,\n>> Deal with in such a way where somebody"},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"disrupting you doesn't

Right."},"705":{"dur":6,"text":"Talk about people going around us,\njust think about how hard it is for"},"712":{"dur":4,"text":"someone to do everything that you can\nto connect two and half billion people"},"716":{"dur":4,"text":"with 50 million merchants in 200-some\nodd locations around the world."},"721":{"dur":3,"text":"And people, and so there are domestic\nnetworks across the
