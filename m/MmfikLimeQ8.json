there,"},"161":{"dur":2,"text":"please, don't make us do \nanything really stupid.\""},"163":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, maybe for some other people,"},"166":{"dur":3,"text":"maybe for some other

to do?"},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"So I started to look around for jobs,"},"288":{"dur":3,"text":"and I was looking around and found\nabsolutely nothing appealing."},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I was looking around \nfor more opportunities,"},"294":{"dur":2,"text":"and eventually found this opportunity."},"296":{"dur":4,"text":"It was to start my very own \nmobile phone unlocking business"},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"which basically meant \nthat if you have a mobile phone,"},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"and it was locked to a certain network,"},"306":{"dur":2,"text":"and say you want to go\ntravelling to Australia"},"308":{"dur":1,"text":"and use an Australian sim card,"},"309":{"dur":2,"text":"you could come to the website \nand unlock your phone."},"312":{"dur":2,"text":"There were just a few massive \nproblems with this;"},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"first, I didn't know \nmuch about mobile phones"},"317":{"dur":2,"text":"beyond the fact that they\nmade calls and sent texts,"},"319":{"dur":1,"text":"let alone mobile phone unlocking."},"321":{"dur":3,"text":"And I had no idea how to build \nan online business."},"325":{"dur":3,"text":"But the only other opportunity\nwas to sell sweets at Cirque du Soleil."},"328":{"dur":2,"text":"so I was like sell sweets \nat Cirque du Soleil,"},"330":{"dur":1,"text":"or start my own business."},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I went with the idea\nof starting my own business,"},"334":{"dur":1,"text":"it sounded a way more adventurous."},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I got started,\nand I realised really quickly,"},"339":{"dur":2,"text":"that when you don't have \na clue of what to do,"},"341":{"dur":3,"text":"the only thing you can do\nis ask for help, and that is what I did."},"344":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I asked for help and within\na few short weeks,"},"347":{"dur":3,"text":"I put together probably \nthe world's worst website."},"350":{"dur":4,"text":"I discovered Google AdWords\nas a way to drive traffic to the website,"},"355":{"dur":3,"text":"and with a credit card\nand spending a limit of \u00a330 a day,"},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"my business was officially up and running."},"361":{"dur":3,"text":"Then over the next couple of years,\nwhen I wasn't studying for my degree,"},"365":{"dur":2,"text":"I was learning how to build this business;"},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"I was reading books,"},"369":{"dur":1,"text":"I was listening to audio programs,"},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"and in my final year,\nI went to night school"},"373":{"dur":1,"text":"to learn more about web development."},"375":{"dur":3,"text":"I graduated in 2007 \nwith an amazing degree"},"378":{"dur":2,"text":"and a business that was flying."},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"And I decided that being an entrepreneur"},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"was going to be way more fun \nthan being a lawyer."},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"So I set my sights high \nand I decided to build,"},"389":{"dur":1,"text":"- to take the business global -"},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"to build a successful global business."},"393":{"dur":1,"text":"So, we got a new supplier based in America"},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"who can unlock practically \nevery phone under the sun."},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"We redid the website,\nwe expanded the team,"},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"we got real good at online marketing,"},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"and within a few years, we were receiving"},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"over 100 000 hits\nto the website every month."},"408":{"dur":3,"text":"And we were selling thousands \nand thousands of codes every single month,"},"411":{"dur":3,"text":"and I had reached my goal\nto build a successful global business."},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"But there was one massive problem."},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"I was miserable."},"421":{"dur":3,"text":"I was running this business\npredominantly from my home office,"},"424":{"dur":3,"text":"where I lived in an apartment; my second \nbedroom was turned into an office."},"428":{"dur":4,"text":"And I felt completely lonely,\ntotally isolated and lost."},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"Something that I think \nso many people experience"},"435":{"dur":1,"text":"but not very many of us talk about."},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"And I crumbled."},"439":{"dur":4,"text":"I started to question everything\nand I started to think questions like:"},"444":{"dur":1,"text":"What am I doing?"},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"What is the point of all of this?"},"447":{"dur":3,"text":"The more I thought about those\nquestions, the more confused I felt."},"450":{"dur":1,"text":"And the more confused I felt,"},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"the more these negative thoughts \nwhich cloud my mind,"},"454":{"dur":3,"text":"the more I began to doubt everything,\nand worry about everything,"},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"and just question everything."},"460":{"dur":3,"text":"And as the months rolled by,\nI became more and more negative,"},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"more and more self-defeatist,"},"465":{"dur":5,"text":"and literally, this positive optimistic\nand \"go get it \"person that I once was,"},"471":{"dur":1,"text":"had just disappeared."},"472":{"dur":3,"text":"I'd become totally negative \nand self-sabotaging."},"475":{"dur":1,"text":"I'd come up with ideas,"},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"I'd shoot them down,\nI'd talk to myself out of it."},"479":{"dur":4,"text":"Then it got to 2010 and I felt like \nI was in complete despair."},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I packed my bags \nand I went travelling to Australia"},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"in the hope of having an epiphany."},"491":{"dur":4,"text":"Spent three months traveling \naround Australia, no epiphany,"},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"and I was just like: \nwhat am I supposed to do?"},"498":{"dur":4,"text":"So then I came back to the UK, and well,\neven more miserable than before,"},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"because all of my problems \nwere still waiting for me,"},"505":{"dur":1,"text":"and the weather was rubbish."},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"Then I was like, \"What am I going to do?\""},"509":{"dur":4,"text":"So the next few months, I found myself\nbeing suffocated by my problems."},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"you know where you feel like\nyou can't get rid of these doubts"},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"and these worries \nand it was all I'd focus on."},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"I'd come up with ideas,\nI'd find opportunities,"},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"and I'd just talk myself out of it,\nthinking that I couldn't do it."},"524":{"dur":5,"text":"And then finally, in 2011,\nI figured out where I was going wrong."},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"And I believe I was going wrong \nfor two massive reasons:"},"533":{"dur":4,"text":"the first reason was that\nyes, I wanted to be successful,"},"537":{"dur":1,"text":"and quite frankly,"},"539":{"dur":3,"text":"doesn't every single person \nin this room wants to be successful?"},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"But mobile phone unlocking\nwas not my dream."},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"At the time, I was reading this book\nby Michael Gerber called \"The E-Myth\","},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"and in \"The E-Myth\",\nthere is a chapter on primary aims."},"553":{"dur":4,"text":"Michael Gerber says:\nImagine walking into a room;"},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"sat in the room,\nare your friends and family,"},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"and as you walk down the center\nof the room, you see a box."},"565":{"dur":4,"text":"And as you get to the front of the room\nyou realize that you are in the box,"},"569":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's your funeral."},"571":{"dur":4,"text":"And he says, \"What kind of things\ndo you want people to be saying"},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"about the kind of life that you lived,"},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"about the kind of person that you were,"},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"and the kind of things that you achieved?\""},"583":{"dur":3,"text":"And I realized, I had no idea."},"587":{"dur":3,"text":"So there was no wonder \nthat I felt so off track."},"590":{"dur":3,"text":"I had never ever been on track"},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"And the second reason \nwhy I think went wrong,"},"597":{"dur":3,"text":"is because of what was going on up here;\nwhat was going on in my head."},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"All these doubts, all these worries,\nall this self-limiting belief."},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"I came across a quote \nby Anthony Robbins that said,"},"607":{"dur":6,"text":"\"Your destiny is determined by the choices\nyou make. Choose now. Choose well.\""},"614":{"dur":4,"text":"And I realized that I was \nresponsible for this misery;"},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"I was responsible for the fact \nthat I was stuck in a rut."},"622":{"dur":3,"text":"I remember looking at my life thinking\nI am waking up every single day"},"625":{"dur":1,"text":"and focusing on my problems."},"627":{"dur":4,"text":"I am waking up every day and giving\nso much focus and attention"},"632":{"dur":4,"text":"to all of these awful thoughts,\nthese doubts, and these worries."},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"I am coming up with ideas\nand I am shooting them down,"},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"I am talking myself out of doing\nanything whatsoever."},"642":{"dur":4,"text":"And I realized that if I wanted\nto live an incredible life"},"646":{"dur":3,"text":"and achieve amazing things,\n- and I really did -"},"649":{"dur":3,"text":"that I had to get my mind to be \non the same wavelength as me."},"653":{"dur":4,"text":"I realized that I had to figure out \nwhat it was that I wanted to achieve;"},"658":{"dur":3,"text":"why I was wanted to achieve it,\nwhy it actually meant something to me."},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"I had to figure out the kind of person\nthat I needed to become,"},"665":{"dur":1,"text":"in order to make it happen."},"666":{"dur":4,"text":"And then, I had to program \nmy mind to make it happen."},"671":{"dur":3,"text":"I had to program my mind for success."},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"And that is exactly what I ended up doing,"},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Mission Success\" began."},"679":{"dur":4,"text":"And so I started this off by thinking \nabout: what do I actually want?"},"684":{"dur":4,"text":"And so I looked at my life and I thought,\n\"I love being an entrepreneur,"},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"I love coming up with ideas \nand turning them into reality"},"691":{"dur":1,"text":"it is so much fun.\""},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"And then looked \nat my problems and thought,"},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"\"I feel really lonely and lost \nas an entrepreneur.\""},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"And I looked at them with \na different perspective."},"699":{"dur":3,"text":"Rather than feeling bad about it,\nI thought, \"What can I do about it?"},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"There must be other people out there that\nare in exactly the same position as me.\""},"706":{"dur":5,"text":"So I came up with this idea to create \nthe Female Entrepreneur Association,"},"711":{"dur":1,"text":"and it sounded so official."},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was doing it,\nand I had this massive idea,"},"716":{"dur":1,"text":"I would create this global network"},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"of thousands of women \nfrom all over the world"},"720":{"dur":2,"text":"and help to inspire them and connect them"},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"and just help to empower them \nto build successful businesses."},"726":{"dur":3,"text":"But I had no idea, \nhow I was going to do this."},"729":{"dur":3,"text":"Then I was like, \"Right, I need to program\nmy mind to make this happen.\""},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"So I started by becoming consciously aware"},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"of the things I was thinking every day,"},"738":{"dur":2,"text":"and whenever I caught myself \nthinking of something like,"},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Carrie, who is going to come\nto this website?"},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"Who are you to give advice to anyone?"},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"This is rubbish,\nthis is a ridiculous idea,"},"747":{"dur":1,"text":"you're never going to be able to do it.\""},"749":{"dur":3,"text":"Every time I caught myself saying\nsomething like that,I would stop myself,"},"753":{"dur":4,"text":"and I realized that I had the power \nto take control over my thoughts"},"757":{"dur":2,"text":"rather than letting them control me."},"759":{"dur":4,"text":"I knew that I could stop myself \nfrom thinking these things."},"763":{"dur":1,"text":"And I did,"},"764":{"dur":3,"text":"I replaced the negative rubbish \nannoying thoughts,"},"767":{"dur":1,"text":"and told them to shut up,"},"769":{"dur":3,"text":"and I replaced them with positive \nthoughts that were empowering me,"},"773":{"dur":3,"text":"thoughts that were actually helping me\nto move towards my goal."},"776":{"dur":2,"text":"I also started to listen \nto guided visualization,"},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"to program my subconscious\nmind for success."},"782":{"dur":3,"text":"And I got really into doing visualizations"},"785":{"dur":3,"text":"vividly picturing what I wanted \nto achieve, seeing it happen,"},"789":{"dur":3,"text":"and then feeling it happen, like\nit was happening right then and there,"},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"just like all the top athletes do."},"795":{"dur":3,"text":"I got so clear on what\nI wanted to make happen,"},"798":{"dur":3,"text":"and since then my life \nhas totally changed."},"802":{"dur":3,"text":"I've built one of the largest online\nnetworking groups of female entrepreneurs,"},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"with over 100 000 women involved."},"808":{"dur":3,"text":"And then I came up with this crazy \nidea to launch a digital magazine,"},"812":{"dur":3,"text":"which then became the fastest growing \ndigital magazine for female entrepreneurs."},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"When I created it, I made\nthis wish list in my mind"},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"of all the people I wanted \non the front cover;"},"820":{"dur":3,"text":"these best-selling authors,\nthese incredibly successful entrepreneurs."},"824":{"dur":3,"text":"I had no idea how I would make it happen,\nbut I was so convinced it would."},"828":{"dur":3,"text":"I then put their faces\non mock-ups of the front cover,"},"831":{"dur":2,"text":"printed them off and stuck them \non my goal board,"},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"and just visualized them\nbeing on the front cover;"},"837":{"dur":2,"text":"visualized what it would \nfeel like the moment"},"839":{"dur":1,"text":"I'd send out an email to my network."},"841":{"dur":1,"text":"And I could say to them,\n\"Hey everyone,"},"843":{"dur":2,"text":"this person's on the front cover \nthis month, how exciting!\""},"845":{"dur":3,"text":"I got so unbelievably clear \nabout what I wanted to do."},"848":{"dur":1,"text":"People would come up to me and say,"},"850":{"dur":1,"text":"\"How are you going\nto make this happen?\""},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"I was like, \"I don't know, \nbut I am going to make it happen.\""},"855":{"dur":0,"text":"And it did happen,"},"856":{"dur":1,"text":"So then I thought,"},"857":{"dur":2,"text":"\"What other crazy goals\ncould I make happen?"},"860":{"dur":1,"text":"What else is possible?\""},"861":{"dur":1,"text":"So I set more crazy goals for myself."},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"I was like, \"I want to go \nto Buckingham Palace,"},"866":{"dur":3,"text":"I want to go to the House of Lords,\nI want to speak at the House of Commons.\""},"869":{"dur":2,"text":"And I set more crazy goals for myself."},"871":{"dur":2,"text":"And last year every single one \nof them happened."},"874":{"dur":5,"text":"And I realized that if I could \nget my mind to be certain,"},"880":{"dur":2,"text":"that I could make something happen,"},"882":{"dur":4,"text":"that somehow I would figure out\na way, and I always have."},"887":{"dur":2,"text":"Because success is no
