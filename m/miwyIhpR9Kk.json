This was my existential moment.\nI had recently turned 50. I had a child. And"},"706":{"dur":8,"text":"I had serious medical problem. So, this was\nmy intimation of mortality and the thought"},"715":{"dur":4,"text":"was looking, \"Now, what are you doing to do\nwhen you grow up? It's time to settle down,"},"719":{"dur":5,"text":"buckle down, and try to do something with\nyour life, Randall, for God's sake.\""},"724":{"dur":10,"text":"So, the first thing I thought is Bonny Doon\nis just way too complex. Too many moving parts."},"734":{"dur":7,"text":"We were producing, in the heyday, about 450\nthousand cases annually, which made us the"},"741":{"dur":5,"text":"28th largest winery in the United States.\nAnd this meant that we actually had to compete"},"747":{"dur":3,"text":"with people, who actually knew what they were\ndoing, who actually really were in the wine"},"751":{"dur":1,"text":"business and could do all these things."},"752":{"dur":7,"text":"So, we accidentally became a large winery.\nAnd we're very leveraged and very, all the"},"760":{"dur":5,"text":"things that are very dangerous about being\nin business. So, the first thought was, \"I"},"766":{"dur":3,"text":"gotta sell Bonny Doon. I just have to do it.\"\n'Cause the problem of course was that nobody"},"770":{"dur":4,"text":"wanted to buy Bonny Doon for more than like,\nsix cents."},"774":{"dur":6,"text":"So, I ended up selling off those assets that\nwere semi-detachable. And it turns out, in"},"781":{"dur":5,"text":"fact, that these were the assets that I least\ndetached to. So, I sold off our large brands."},"786":{"dur":6,"text":"I sold off Big House and Cardinal Zin. Shrunk\nthe production. Simplified the production."},"792":{"dur":5,"text":"And then started focusing in on the idea of\nfinding a place where I could grow grapes"},"798":{"dur":10,"text":"and possibly do something in a true vin de\nterroir. So, a couple years go by. It turns"},"808":{"dur":8,"text":"out that it's really hard to rebrand yourself\nwhen people think you are this goofy, happy-go-lucky,"},"817":{"dur":8,"text":"anything for a joke kind of winery with funny\nlabels and this whatever insouciant attitude"},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"that you have, allegedly insouciant attitude."},"828":{"dur":8,"text":"It's hard to get people to take the wine seriously.\nSo, it has been a bit of a struggle. And we've"},"836":{"dur":5,"text":"continued to shrink the production. And then\nlast year, I sold off this other brand we"},"841":{"dur":5,"text":"had, which was called Pacific Rim. And that\nwas a wine we had spun off in Washington."},"847":{"dur":6,"text":"And all along the way, I'd been like, \"How\ncan I get escape velocity and do this next"},"853":{"dur":8,"text":"thing?\" So, I'd been looking at a lot of property\nand going on a lot of realtor dates, if you"},"861":{"dur":8,"text":"will. And one property's nice and another\nproperty's nice. And I never really was all"},"870":{"dur":3,"text":"that excited about any of them until this\none property I came too."},"873":{"dur":5,"text":"It actually turned out that I had dreamt about\nthis property. And when I saw it, I said,"},"878":{"dur":5,"text":"\"Hmm. I remember this property. This is quite\namazing.\" And sure enough, this was the property."},"884":{"dur":6,"text":"And it's in San Juan Batista and I ended up\nbuying it. It gets even stranger 'cause I"},"891":{"dur":5,"text":"also dreamt about a mountain lion on this\nproperty and I saw the mountain lion recently,"},"896":{"dur":1,"text":"which was also quite interesting."},"898":{"dur":4,"text":"And luckily for me, it was quite far away,\nbut my colleague, Philippe, got to see it"},"903":{"dur":4,"text":"at very close range. And that was a little\nmore challenging for him. About 20 feet away,"},"907":{"dur":7,"text":"so that scared the heck out of him. Anyways,\nso now I've got the property. Now what do"},"915":{"dur":1,"text":"I do?"},"916":{"dur":7,"text":"And so, the expressed intention is, how do\nyou make a vin de terroir? And the problem"},"924":{"dur":7,"text":"is, how do you do it, essentially, in a short\nlifetime or what is left of one's lifetime?"},"932":{"dur":4,"text":"There's basically two ways of doing it, I\nthink. Well, there's the European way, which"},"936":{"dur":6,"text":"is to iterate and observe over 500 to 800\nyears. This is not a practical way."},"943":{"dur":1,"text":"[small laughter]"},"945":{"dur":7,"text":"It's OK if you can consistently reincarnate\nyourself with some degree of precision, it"},"952":{"dur":6,"text":"works. But failing that, less well. So essentially,\nI think there's only two ways to approach"},"959":{"dur":10,"text":"it. One is decide you love X grape. You are\njust crazy about X grape and then figure out"},"969":{"dur":4,"text":"how are you going to make your X grape somewhere."},"973":{"dur":4,"text":"In other words, how can you find conditions\nthat you know or believe will be brilliant"},"978":{"dur":4,"text":"for this grape? Pinot Noir is a good example.\nWe've got a lot of people running around who"},"983":{"dur":5,"text":"are obsessed with Pinot Noir. Most of them\nare men. Why? Because it's really, really"},"988":{"dur":1,"text":"difficult."},"989":{"dur":5,"text":"And if you're a guy, you are just genetically\npredisposed to do things that are like, pretty"},"995":{"dur":6,"text":"much impossible because that's how you know\nthat you're a real guy. So, you got all these"},"1001":{"dur":9,"text":"people out chasing this Holy Grail. And the\nproblem with this, I believe, is that at the"},"1011":{"dur":6,"text":"end of the day, the very best thing you can\ndo is produce something that tastes vaguely"},"1017":{"dur":1,"text":"Burgundian."},"1018":{"dur":5,"text":"It will never be as interesting as proper\nBurgundy. However, it will be like ten times"},"1023":{"dur":5,"text":"as expensive as proper Burgundy because the\neffort that you have to put into replicating"},"1028":{"dur":8,"text":"these conditions is so wildly expensive. And\nat the end of the day, I'm not sold that you're"},"1037":{"dur":3,"text":"really gonna come up with anything all that\noriginal."},"1040":{"dur":5,"text":"So that's one way of doing it. The other way\nof doing it, I believe, maybe there's other"},"1045":{"dur":6,"text":"ways, but I haven't thought of them. The other\nway is find a piece of property that you imagine,"},"1052":{"dur":10,"text":"rightly or wrongly, possesses the possibility\nof expressing terroir. Now, it's a little"},"1062":{"dur":1,"text":"bit tautological."},"1063":{"dur":5,"text":"What is terroir? Terroir is the sense of place.\nOK, well every place then, expresses a sense"},"1068":{"dur":10,"text":"of place by definition. Not all places are\nas interesting or as expressive or as eloquent"},"1079":{"dur":4,"text":"as others. Some don't have a lot--. It's like\npeople. Some people just don't have a lot"},"1083":{"dur":1,"text":"to say."},"1084":{"dur":4,"text":"Some people have a lot to say. Some terroirs\nhave a lot to say. Those are the ones that"},"1089":{"dur":14,"text":"are interesting. Terroir is essentially the\nability of a site and a plant to solve each"},"1104":{"dur":5,"text":"other\u2019s problems. So in other words, a brilliant\nterroir is one that solves the problems more"},"1110":{"dur":10,"text":"elegantly than the other surrounding areas\nmost of the time, such that it's able to impart"},"1120":{"dur":3,"text":"distinctiveness to that wine."},"1123":{"dur":6,"text":"And in Europe, it's quite extraordinary where\nliterally the different terroir, or the different"},"1129":{"dur":6,"text":"cru, or vineyards, are separated sometimes\nby 30 feet or 40 feet and they will be very"},"1136":{"dur":5,"text":"different, one from the other. So, this is\nreally, really extraordinary. So, how can"},"1142":{"dur":2,"text":"you get at this?"},"1144":{"dur":6,"text":"How can you illuminate this in a short period\nof time? So many of these decisions seemed"},"1151":{"dur":4,"text":"utterly arbitrary. What kind of root stock\ndo you grow? What kind of variety do you grow?"},"1156":{"dur":3,"text":"What kind of spacing do you grow? What sort\nof row orientation do you grow?"},"1159":{"dur":9,"text":"Do you plant them on--? How do you trellis\nthem? Do you irrigate? Do you not irrigate?"},"1168":{"dur":9,"text":"OK. So, I've had this idea that there's certain\nthings that need to be observed. So, let me"},"1178":{"dur":9,"text":"get back to what I think is really the gist\nof terroir, or the gist of a great wine. The"},"1187":{"dur":9,"text":"gist of a great wine is, I believe, a grape\nvariety or a blend of grape varieties that"},"1197":{"dur":8,"text":"somehow have a perfect congruency to the site\non which they're grown."},"1206":{"dur":4,"text":"So in other words, Pinot noir is a brilliant\ngrape, but it's not a brilliant grape when"},"1211":{"dur":3,"text":"you grow it in Fresno. It's a ridiculous grape\nwhen you grow it in Fresno. But when you grow"},"1214":{"dur":7,"text":"it in Maurice Saint-Denis, or von Romenay,\nor Chambretaud, it's totally brilliant. Nebbiolo"},"1222":{"dur":7,"text":"is a brilliant grape when you grow it in Barolo,\nnot very many other places."},"1229":{"dur":7,"text":"Cabernet is a pretty good grape when you grow\nit in Napa Valley, but it's an extraordinary"},"1237":{"dur":8,"text":"grape when you grow it in the Medoc. So, my\nbelief is that there's not necessarily--."},"1245":{"dur":3,"text":"There are some grapes that are more interesting\nthan others. That's for sure."},"1249":{"dur":3,"text":"And there's some grapes that are not very\ninteresting at all. But essentially, what"},"1252":{"dur":5,"text":"is interesting about a grape is how well-suited\nit is to the place where it's grown. So, the"},"1258":{"dur":5,"text":"real question is how do you find that congruency\nbetween the grape and the place that it's"},"1263":{"dur":2,"text":"grown?"},"1265":{"dur":5,"text":"So, here's how I've broken down the problem.\nThe first problem is I decided if you wanna"},"1271":{"dur":7,"text":"grow a grape that expresses terroir, you need\nto amplify the signal. And it's basically"},"1279":{"dur":5,"text":"kind of a physics or electronics problem.\nWhat you want to do is amplify the signal"},"1284":{"dur":1,"text":"without distorting it."},"1286":{"dur":7,"text":"So, its signal to noise ratio. So, how do\nyou boost the signal without distorting it,"},"1293":{"dur":9,"text":"creating noise? One of the ways is not irrigate.\nIn other words, if you have grape vines that"},"1302":{"dur":6,"text":"are exploring a large volume of soil territory,\nthey're imprinting on more of the qualities"},"1309":{"dur":7,"text":"of the site and expressing it and distilling\nit, if you will, into the wine that's expressed."},"1316":{"dur":7,"text":"You want to have probably limited production.\nSo in other words again, this concentration"},"1323":{"dur":9,"text":"effect. Lots of roots, very little fruit.\nIt's kind of again, concentrating the signal."},"1333":{"dur":3,"text":"You don't want to deform the wine in the winery.\nYou don't want to use a lot of new oak."},"1336":{"dur":5,"text":"You don't want to pick it overripe. You don't\nwant to use cultured yeast. You don't wanna"},"1341":{"dur":8,"text":"use high-tech methods of reverse osmosis.\nAll those things, essentially, deform the"},"1350":{"dur":8,"text":"intrinsic character of the wine. So, I came\nto this like, \"OK, I need to dry farm. I need"},"1358":{"dur":1,"text":"to grow grapes without irrigation."},"1359":{"dur":6,"text":"I've got this land. It's got really interesting\nsoil. But you know, it only rains about 16"},"1366":{"dur":4,"text":"inches a year in San Juan Batista.\" In a good\nyear, it might be 20, but most of the time,"},"1370":{"dur":7,"text":"it's like 15 or 16, which is pretty marginal.\nSome of our soils are nice and deep and hold"},"1377":{"dur":1,"text":"a lot of moisture."},"1378":{"dur":7,"text":"Others are sandy, not so deep, not a lot of\nmoisture. I ran into a friend of mine a couple"},"1385":{"dur":6,"text":"of years ago at a barbecue who follows these\nthings. And I said, \"You know, Greg.
