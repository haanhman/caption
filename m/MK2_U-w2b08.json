going to catch up,"},"312":{"dur":3,"text":"but then we have two more\nsignificant problems."},"315":{"dur":3,"text":"The second one has to do with price and\nsecurity, privacy,"},"319":{"dur":3,"text":"a loss of control consumers\nare kinda freaked out"},"322":{"dur":4,"text":"about what it might mean to bring\nthese devices into the

on the individual"},"397":{"dur":4,"text":"products, the thermostats, the light\nbulbs, the refrigerators, the cameras and"},"402":{"dur":1,"text":"the specific use cases."},"403":{"dur":4,"text":"So,

thing, but I'm going to\nargue today that the value is among"},"418":{"dur":4,"text":"the interaction among the devices, not\namong the individual devices themselves."},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, we think that the smart\nhome values actually embedded"},"426":{"dur":3,"text":"in what the smart home identity\nmeans to consumers, and"},"430":{"dur":5,"text":"what kind of experiences emerge

things."},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"And so let me take a few\nminutes to talk about that."},"442":{"dur":1,"text":"One of the things we've noticed,"},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"and a lot of the work we do\nwith companies suggests that"},"447":{"dur":3,"text":"at the beginning consumers get one device,\nthey get another device into the home."},"450":{"dur":3,"text":"And then something really\ninteresting starts to happen."},"454":{"dur":3,"text":"Pretty soon they want the devices\nto talk to each other."},"457":{"dur":1,"text":"They want the devices to connect."},"459":{"dur":4,"text":"They want some sort of interaction, and\nthey want something more to happen than"},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"just what the individual\ndevices can do themself."},"466":{"dur":4,"text":"And so what happens is the interaction\namong the devices becomes much more"},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"important than the single devices."},"473":{"dur":4,"text":"And from that, consumer experience\nhas the potential to emerge."},"478":{"dur":3,"text":"And so when you think about what\nkind of framework would be useful"},"482":{"dur":4,"text":"to help us understand what can emerge\nfrom all of these interactions."},"486":{"dur":3,"text":"We're drawing a lot of our framework\nfrom something called assemblage theory."},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm gonna spend like a minute\ntalking about it, but"},"492":{"dur":4,"text":"it's a really interesting theory from\nthe neorealist school of philosophy."},"496":{"dur":4,"text":"And it basically helps us understand\nhow all the interactions among"},"501":{"dur":4,"text":"entities can create a whole that\nis more than the sum of the parts."},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's take a look at one of\nthe key idea forum this theory,"},"509":{"dur":4,"text":"the idea we're arguing is that\nthe fundamental unit of analysis."},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"When we wanna think about consumer\nexperience in the smart home"},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"Is not to think about\nthe individual devices, but"},"520":{"dur":3,"text":"instead to think about\nthe interactions among those devices."},"524":{"dur":3,"text":"And we consider those in the context\nof what we call paired capacities."},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"And so for example,\nyou can see here in this figure,"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"there's a consumer might be\ninteracting with a device."},"533":{"dur":3,"text":"So, if a consumer triggers\na beacon when they enter a room,"},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"then maybe the Philips Hue\nturns on the light."},"539":{"dur":3,"text":"Or similarly if a motion\ncensor detects activity,"},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"then my security camera starts recording."},"546":{"dur":4,"text":"So the big idea here is these\ninteractions always happen together in"},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"this paired capacity."},"552":{"dur":4,"text":"Where the capacity of one device\nhas the capacity to affect and"},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"the other device has\nthe capacity to be affected."},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"And this simple concept turns out to\nbe really important when we wanted to"},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"understand interaction."},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"And the other thing I wanna point out\nhere is you have all these individual"},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"interaction events, and then you\nhave this events stream over time."},"573":{"dur":4,"text":"And these interactions together\nfrom this what can emerge"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"are different kinds of experiences."},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's take one example of\nsome of these interactions."},"584":{"dur":4,"text":"Now some of these interactions, so for\nexample in that slide I just showed you,"},"589":{"dur":3,"text":"they define what the marketing\nexperts would call used cases."},"593":{"dur":3,"text":"So for example, when the garage\ndoor opens or closes in my house,"},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"then turn the kitchen lights red for\nthat moment."},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's a kind of a red\nalert kind of use case."},"602":{"dur":5,"text":"And that can lead to the use case that the\nindustry would call safety and security."},"608":{"dur":4,"text":"And use cases in fact dominate\ncurrent smart home marketing."},"612":{"dur":3,"text":"IBM five, now six years ago,\nintroduced a white paper,"},"616":{"dur":4,"text":"suggesting there would only be several use\ncases that would help define the industry."},"620":{"dur":1,"text":"And then five years later,"},"622":{"dur":3,"text":"Lowe's Iris is marketing still\non the basis of those use cases."},"626":{"dur":3,"text":"Smart Things is still marketing\non the basis of those use cases."},"629":{"dur":4,"text":"And in fact, many marketers in\nthe industry are saying what will be that"},"634":{"dur":4,"text":"secret sauce combination of use cases\nthat will get consumers to adopt?"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"But we think that's the wrong question."},"642":{"dur":5,"text":"Instead, if you think about it,\nuse cases don't explain what can emerge."},"647":{"dur":3,"text":"So you have all of this multitude\nof interactions constantly"},"651":{"dur":3,"text":"happening in a dynamic and\nheterogeneous way inside the home."},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"And something really\ninteresting emerges from that."},"657":{"dur":4,"text":"In just this example, all these different\nthings happening in the background,"},"662":{"dur":3,"text":"one experience could emerge, hey,\nmy house really cares about me."},"666":{"dur":1,"text":"It's really taking care of me."},"668":{"dur":1,"text":"And so these experiences,"},"669":{"dur":4,"text":"we think become really important in\nthinking about smart home marketing."},"673":{"dur":3,"text":"So just sort of a quick\nsummary of our framework."},"676":{"dur":3,"text":"We're gonna argue that the smart home\nrepresents these interactions involving"},"680":{"dur":3,"text":"the exchange of these compared capacities."},"683":{"dur":4,"text":"The capacity of one component to affect\nis always compared with the capacity of"},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"another component to to be affected."},"689":{"dur":4,"text":"And the smart home experience will emerge\nfrom all these paired capacities that"},"694":{"dur":4,"text":"are exercised in all of these ongoing\ninteractions that are occurring in"},"698":{"dur":0,"text":"the smart home."},"699":{"dur":3,"text":"And so it's this experience that\nturns out to be really important,"},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"not the individual devices themselves."},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"And just to give you an example\nof what I'm taking about and"},"708":{"dur":1,"text":"why we think this is really important."},"710":{"dur":4,"text":"Both the home and the consumer can\ndevelop these emerging capacities and"},"714":{"dur":3,"text":"from these emerging capacities,\nexperience can emerge."},"718":{"dur":4,"text":"So for example, the home has the capacity\nto track the behavior of its occupants,"},"723":{"dur":1,"text":"say for example with a smart camera."},"725":{"dur":4,"text":"Then the home has a capacity to use smart\nbehavior to suggest how things can change."},"729":{"dur":3,"text":"So for example maybe the home recognizes\nyou're using too much energy and"},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"it might make a suggestion\nto turn the thermostat down."},"736":{"dur":5,"text":"And then from this, what can emerge is the\ncapacity of the home to actually be smart."},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"So rather than marketing\nthe home as smart, the home"},"744":{"dur":4,"text":"actually could develop the capacity to be\nsmart through all of these interactions."},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"At the same time,\nconsumers have capacities."},"752":{"dur":4,"text":"So the consumer could develop the capacity\nto feel this sort of tangible sense of"},"756":{"dur":4,"text":"presence in the home from all these\nongoing background interactions,"},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"some background, some explicit."},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"The consumer might have the capacity\nto feel the home is alive to them."},"766":{"dur":1,"text":"And then I think this\none's really interesting."},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"The consumer might have the capacity\nto feel the home is with them even when"},"772":{"dur":0,"text":"they're away."},"773":{"dur":3,"text":"And if any of you have second homes and\nhave installed cameras and"},"776":{"dur":4,"text":"other devices in those homes, which you\nkeep watch on through your smartphone."},"780":{"dur":4,"text":"You know exactly what I'm talking about\nbecause it's actually a sense of I'm there"},"785":{"dur":1,"text":"even when I'm not there."},"786":{"dur":1,"text":"That's an emergent capacity and"},"788":{"dur":3,"text":"we think those kinds of experiences\nare going to be really important."},"791":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay, so I've got about five minutes left\nto share seven important insights derived"},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"from my framework, so let me get to those."},"798":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, the first recommendation we have for"},"801":{"dur":4,"text":"marketers is to market from the bottom-up\ninteractions, not just the top-down."},"805":{"dur":1,"text":"What this means is we want to,"},"807":{"dur":3,"text":"rather than telling consumers what\nthey should in the smart home,"},"811":{"dur":4,"text":"we want consumers to intercreate\ntheir own bottom of the interactions."},"816":{"dur":4,"text":"And so from this, these different\nopportunities and experiences will emerge."},"820":{"dur":4,"text":"In fact, saying that the smart\nhas five use cases is like"},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"saying the Internet has five uses."},"828":{"dur":4,"text":"And so we wanna be really careful about\nmaking sure we're not doing this sort of"},"832":{"dur":2,"text":"only this top down marketing."},"834":{"dur":4,"text":"Number two, when we market the smart home,\nwe want to think back to Steve Jobs."},"839":{"dur":3,"text":"When Steve Jobs first introduced and\nmarketed the iPad,"},"843":{"dur":3,"text":"he didn't market it on\nthe basis of use cases."},"846":{"dur":4,"text":"Instead, he said this is everything\nyou already understand but more."},"851":{"dur":4,"text":"He suggested it was magical,\nhe suggested it was revolutionary."},"855":{"dur":3,"text":"And if you remember when the iPad\ncame out a scant six years,"},"859":{"dur":4,"text":"there was a lot of the name was mocked,\npeople were really confused."},"864":{"dur":1,"text":"What is it, a giant iPhone?"},"865":{"dur":4,"text":"And it was very not clear\nhow to categorize it."},"869":{"dur":3,"text":"And the smart home is like\nthat early iPad at this point,"},"873":{"dur":3,"text":"we're not really sure what\nto do what to do with it."},"876":{"dur":2,"text":"We're not really sure what these\ninteractions are going to produce, but"},"879":{"dur":4,"text":"we need the opportunity to think of\nit from those bottom-up interactions."},"883":{"dur":4,"text":"Number three, marketers need to focus and\nencourage on habitual repetition."},"888":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is repeating the same sort\nof interactions over and over again."},"892":{"dur":3,"text":"When my wash is done, send me a text,\nwhen I run out of Tide,"},"896":{"dur":1,"text":"hit the Amazon Dash button."},"897":{"dur":3,"text":"When it's dusk, turn on the lights,\nwhen it's midnight turn them off."},"901":{"dur":2,"text":"Through these habitual interactions,"},"903":{"dur":4,"text":"consumers get into the habit of learning\nthese interactions in the home."},"907":{"dur":3,"text":"So we need to get these devices into\nthe home as quickly as possible, and"},"911":{"dur":4,"text":"then we need to encourage\nthese ongoing habits of use."},"916":{"dur":3,"text":"Now one of the things that's really\ngonna be important is we wanna focus on"},"919":{"dur":1,"text":"the ambient interactions."},"921":{"dur":3,"text":"Now remember I said at the beginning here\nthat what I thought was going to be really"},"925":{"dur":3,"text":"important were going to be these\ndevice-to-device interactions."},"928":{"dur":4,"text":"And that they might be even more important\nthan the interactions that we as consumers"},"932":{"dur":1,"text":"have with our devices."},"934":{"dur":3,"text":"And one of the reasons for this is\nbecause these ambient interactions,"},"937":{"dur":3,"text":"these interactions going on in\nthe background on a regular basis."},"941":{"dur":3,"text":"That we aren't even involved\nin because they're autonomous,"},"944":{"dur":3,"text":"those are the kind of interactions\nthat help build trust."},"948":{"dur":4,"text":"And then we can start to feel that\nthe house can reliably do what"},"953":{"dur":1,"text":"we programmed it to do."},"955":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's gonna be really important as we\nstart to think about marketing this going"},"959":{"dur":3,"text":"forward, so that consumers can\ngenerate these feelings of trust."},"963":{"dur":4,"text":"Now might seem a little bit contradictory,\nbut at the same time that we're trying to"},"967":{"dur":3,"text":"encourage this habitual repetition to\ngenerate these consistence sets of"},"971":{"dur":3,"text":"interactions, we also need to\ndo a little bit of shaking up."},"974":{"dur":4,"text":"I don't have time to talk about this\nwhole framework we've developed here, but"},"979":{"dur":4,"text":"the basic idea of what I've been talking\nabout here is these are these habitual"},"984":{"dur":3,"text":"interactions and\na routine use we wanna stimulate."},"987":{"dur":2,"text":"But consumers have the natural\ntendency to get bored."},"990":{"dur":3,"text":"Particularly, as these simple devices\nwe sort of begin to master them and"},"994":{"dur":1,"text":"figure out how to use them."},"995":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, at the same time\nmarketers have to destabilize"},"999":{"dur":3,"text":"to keep consumers interested as\nthe environment gets more complex."},"1002":{"dur":4,"text":"And that can be done through notifications\nand add-ons and software updates and"},"1007":{"dur":3,"text":"new products and things of that nature\nto keep that market developing."},"1012":{"dur":4,"text":"My sixth recommendation,\ninsight derived from our analysis,"},"1016":{"dur":5,"text":"is that marketers need to pay attention to\nemergent individual smart home identities."},"1022":{"dur":4,"text":"And in other words, what's happening\nin these individual homes as consumers"},"1027":{"dur":3,"text":"are interacting with all\nof these different devices."},"1030":{"dur":3,"text":"And the reason they need to do this\nis because what's happening in any"},"1034":{"dur":3,"text":"one individual home isn't\ngonna be that important."},"1037":{"dur":4,"text":"Because from our theory, it's very\nclear that homes, interactions in"},"1042":{"dur":5,"text":"homes are going to sort of tend and\nclump toward interesting patterns."},"1047":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's those patterns we\nneed to be aware of, so"},"1050":{"dur":2,"text":"that we can see what\nthe themes are in use."},"1053":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, the marketers out there will\nrecognize those clumps and patterns."},"1057":{"dur":2,"text":"Those are emergent market segments."},"1059":{"dur":1,"text":"And though I won't have time\nto talk about it today,"},"1061":{"dur":2,"text":"there's a lot of interesting\nanalytic work we're also doing."},"1063":{"dur":5,"text":"Looking at these event streams to deduce\nwhat those patterns actually look like in"},"1069":{"dur":5,"text":"the millions of interactions that we have\nfrom this kind of IOT event stream data."},"1075":{"dur":4,"text":"My final recommendation, maybe a little\ncontroversial, I believe that there's"},"1080":{"dur":4,"text":"going to be a something more that\nemerges that's going to trump privacy."},"1084":{"dur":3,"text":"And if we think about that."},"1087":{"dur":4,"text":"It's possible that there will be\nsomething will happen in the home"},"1092":{"dur":3,"text":"that will make consumers feel\nthat the benefits are so"},"1096":{"dur":3,"text":"great it's worth trading\noff
