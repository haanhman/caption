{"0":{"dur":7,"text":"Translator: Yasmine Wong\nReviewer: ali alshalali"},"8":{"dur":1,"text":"Well,"},"9":{"dur":2,"text":"what I want to communicate to you today"},"11":{"dur":3,"text":"is my enthusiasm for language,"},"15":{"dur":3,"text":"and language as a bridge to other people,"},"18":{"dur":2,"text":"and language as a joy in itself."},"21":{"dur":2,"text":"I grew up in England, many years ago,"},"24":{"dur":2,"text":"and was fortunate in learning."},"26":{"dur":1,"text":"First, a little German,"},"27":{"dur":1,"text":"when I was very small,"},"29":{"dur":2,"text":"but, then, French, very steadily,"},"31":{"dur":2,"text":"from the age of 7 onwards."},"34":{"dur":2,"text":"Very well educated in French."},"36":{"dur":1,"text":"But, not traveling to France,"},"38":{"dur":2,"text":"I never had any money\nto travel to France,"},"40":{"dur":1,"text":"and not really using my French."},"42":{"dur":2,"text":"Very bookish French,\nbut I was good at it."},"45":{"dur":2,"text":"But I refused, I defied my school,"},"47":{"dur":2,"text":"that wanted me to go on with languages"},"49":{"dur":1,"text":"and go to Oxford."},"51":{"dur":1,"text":"I wanted to go to Cambridge,"},"52":{"dur":1,"text":"and I wanted to do mathematics."},"54":{"dur":1,"text":"I defied them, I managed it,"},"56":{"dur":1,"text":"and I got to Cambridge."},"58":{"dur":2,"text":"I became a mathematician,\nthen a scientist."},"60":{"dur":1,"text":"Not a very good mathematician,"},"62":{"dur":1,"text":"but, a better scientist."},"63":{"dur":2,"text":"During that period,"},"66":{"dur":2,"text":"I kept a promise to myself"},"68":{"dur":2,"text":"that I would continue only to read French"},"70":{"dur":2,"text":"for pleasure, not other languages."},"73":{"dur":2,"text":"That meant while I was\nstudying Psychology,"},"76":{"dur":2,"text":"for three years, I was reading,"},"80":{"dur":2,"text":"The obvious, romantic novelists,"},"82":{"dur":1,"text":"Stendhal, Flaubert,"},"83":{"dur":3,"text":"and reading also, poets."},"87":{"dur":1,"text":"This kind of things, not science."},"89":{"dur":2,"text":"So I had a scholarly French,"},"91":{"dur":2,"text":"A literary French and an unusable French,"},"94":{"dur":1,"text":"because I wasn't speaking it."},"97":{"dur":3,"text":"The war came and then,\nfor various reasons,"},"100":{"dur":1,"text":"we had the chance,"},"102":{"dur":1,"text":"I married Peter Milner, physicist,"},"104":{"dur":2,"text":"and we were told we were going"},"106":{"dur":3,"text":"with a group of other\nphysicists to Canada."},"109":{"dur":1,"text":"We didn't know where --"},"111":{"dur":2,"text":"to begin the study of

where\nwe going to end up."},"122":{"dur":1,"text":"We took the train up from Boston,"},"123":{"dur":2,"text":"and lo and behold, I was in Montreal."},"126":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, I had never been out of England,"},"129":{"dur":3,"text":"and I had dreamed of a French milieu,"},"132":{"dur":1,"text":"of a chance to speak French,"},"133":{"dur":1,"text":"and here I was, right there,"},"135":{"dur":1,"text":"in a French speaking city."},"137":{"dur":1,"text":"But, it got better,"},"138":{"dur":2,"text":"because the first job I was offered"},"141":{"dur":2,"text":"was at Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"},"144":{"dur":3,"text":"where they were just starting\na new department of Psychology,"},"147":{"dur":3,"text":"and they wanted me to teach\nexperimental psychology, and run a lab,"},"151":{"dur":3,"text":"and teach, the psychology of memory\nin French."},"155":{"dur":2,"text":"This was a triple challenge."},"158":{"dur":3,"text":"First of all: I had never taught."},"161":{"dur":2,"text":"Secondly: I had never really"},"163":{"dur":2,"text":"used my French beyond, you know,"},"166":{"dur":2,"text":"a few courtesies here and there."},"169":{"dur":2,"text":"And thirdly: my French was literary,"},"172":{"dur":3,"text":"I didn't have the vocabulary\nto teach science in French."},"175":{"dur":2,"text":"So, it took me hours\nto prepare my lectures."},"178":{"dur":4,"text":"But, I never hesitated to accept\nthe challenge, in fact, I welcomed it."},"182":{"dur":3,"text":"I was so excited that\nI would be teaching there."},"185":{"dur":1,"text":"And the students welcomed me,"},"187":{"dur":2,"text":"because, they had no\nexperimental psychology,"},"189":{"dur":2,"text":"it was very clinical at UdeM\nin those days."},"192":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I taught them what they wanted,"},"194":{"dur":1,"text":"and they taught me."},"195":{"dur":1,"text":"They would say,"},"197":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Madame Milner, do you want\nto learn a new word?\""},"199":{"dur":1,"text":"And I said, \"Yes, please!\""},"201":{"dur":2,"text":"\"As many words as possible.\""},"203":{"dur":1,"text":"So I got to be a part of this."},"205":{"dur":2,"text":"The French became part of my life,"},"208":{"dur":1,"text":"as I lived it."},"210":{"dur":2,"text":"It was very enriching, and till this day,"},"212":{"dur":1,"text":"friends from those days"},"214":{"dur":1,"text":"when I spend every New Year's Eve"},"216":{"dur":1,"text":"with friends that I made"},"217":{"dur":1,"text":"during those first years,"},"219":{"dur":3,"text":"because my students were only\nabout two years younger than me."},"222":{"dur":2,"text":"So, this was a wonderful start."},"225":{"dur":2,"text":"But, I owed it of course to having had"},"227":{"dur":3,"text":"this very good grounding\nfrom the beginning"},"230":{"dur":1,"text":"in French,"},"231":{"dur":2,"text":"and it made me feel so strongly,"},"233":{"dur":1,"text":"how useful this was."},"235":{"dur":1,"text":"But of course,"},"236":{"dur":1,"text":"I still hadn't been anywhere,"},"238":{"dur":2,"text":"well, I'd been across the Atlantic,\nbig distance,"},"241":{"dur":1,"text":"but, I hadn't yet been into Europe."},"242":{"dur":1,"text":"But, a few years passed,"},"244":{"dur":2,"text":"I got a little more money,\nthings got easier."},"246":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was even invited to France,"},"248":{"dur":1,"text":"because of my work here,"},"250":{"dur":3,"text":"and there, suddenly,\nI found such a welcome."},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"People just greet you,"},"256":{"dur":3,"text":"you just make a few steps,\nand people greet you."},"259":{"dur":2,"text":"I also discovered, living in\nthis French environment,"},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"how one's personality\neven changes a little."},"264":{"dur":1,"text":"I feel, every time I switch,"},"265":{"dur":1,"text":"of course, I'm switching all the time,"},"267":{"dur":1,"text":"between French and English."},"269":{"dur":1,"text":"I didn't tell you that I,"},"271":{"dur":0,"text":"as a hobby,"},"272":{"dur":1,"text":"late in the war in England,"},"274":{"dur":2,"text":"I began to learn Italian."},"277":{"dur":3,"text":"My Italian was more imperfect in a way,"},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"but, Italians were very welcoming."},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"I made Italian colleagues,"},"284":{"dur":2,"text":"and one day, I arrived in Italy,"},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"expecting to give a lecture in French"},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"because they said that\nit was easier than English"},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"and they said, \"Brenda!\nWe have a surprise for you.\""},"293":{"dur":3,"text":"\"We decided that you're going\nto lecture in Italian tonight.\""},"296":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"298":{"dur":2,"text":"And, from then on,\nbelieve it or not, I did."},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"And this has gone on."},"303":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I really believe in languages"},"306":{"dur":2,"text":"as a builder of bridges,"},"309":{"dur":2,"text":"as a great joy to oneself."},"311":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, but, I'm a brain scientist,"},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"what do brain scientists"},"315":{"dur":1,"text":"have to say about language."},"316":{"dur":1,"text":"And, about this switching,"},"317":{"dur":2,"text":"first, this switching that I do all day,"},"320":{"dur":1,"text":"the grocery store, then at the lab,"},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"so on, back and forth, English and French,"},"324":{"dur":1,"text":"what do they say about it?"},"325":{"dur":1,"text":"They say it's very good for the brain,"},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"you are using the frontal lobes\nof the brain"},"329":{"dur":1,"text":"to do this kind of switching."},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a kind of multitasking,\nit doesn't have to be language."},"334":{"dur":1,"text":"In my case, it's language."},"335":{"dur":1,"text":"But, it's good for the brain."},"337":{"dur":4,"text":"And, what else do you know?\nYou know that if you have Alzheimer,"},"341":{"dur":1,"text":"Bilingualism is not going to protect you"},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"from Alzheimer, unfortunately."},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"But, if you have that devastating disease,"},"348":{"dur":1,"text":"it can affect the course of it,"},"350":{"dur":3,"text":"if you have a bilingual\nor multilingual brain,"},"354":{"dur":2,"text":"your decline, your inevitable decline"},"357":{"dur":2,"text":"with Alzheimer will be slowed."},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"So the message from brain science"},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"is that this is a good thing."},"364":{"dur":3,"text":"But, now I come back\nto the reality of today,"},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"and why should we especially,"},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"in this wonderful city of Montreal"},"372":{"dur":1,"text":"take care of this."},"374":{"dur":3,"text":"It is that, we are here\nwith this opportunity,"},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"you know, I don't think I would be happy"},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"living in a uni-lingual city anymore."},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"I'd be back in my beloved England,"},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"and in many ways, a wonderful place."},"387":{"dur":1,"text":"But, after a while I say,"},"388":{"dur":2,"text":"why is everybody speaking English?"},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"(Laughter)"},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"I want to hear something else."},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"Of course, you can in London,\nin the streets."},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"But, hearing in the streets\nis not the same thing."},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"I am very frustrated\nin the grocery stores,"},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"because, we have now\nmany people from Asia,"},"404":{"dur":2,"text":"and I hear this melodious,"},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"up and down sounds that\nI can't pause at all,"},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"that I'm so frustrated,"},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"I wish I had that also to excite me."},"414":{"dur":3,"text":"But in this amazing city\nthat invites us,"},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"why do we not and\nwhy the Anglophone"},"422":{"dur":1,"text":"part of the city"},"423":{"dur":1,"text":"why do we not go out more,"},"425":{"dur":1,"text":"and speak more in French?"},"426":{"dur":1,"text":"There are many reasons."},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"One is that people are afraid"},"430":{"dur":1,"text":"that they would make a mistake."},"432":{"dur":2,"text":"Something very curious\nhappened last night."},"434":{"dur":1,"text":"Really, this is true."},"436":{"dur":2,"text":"I went home from the rehearsal here,"},"438":{"dur":3,"text":"and I got in the elevator\nin my apartment building,"},"441":{"dur":1,"text":"and a gentleman who I very rarely see"},"443":{"dur":1,"text":"because our work times are different,"},"445":{"dur":3,"text":"who is a school teacher\nin the French system,"},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"we got on, and we exchanged greetings"},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"and I said, in French,"},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Oh, I have been talking about language.\""},"455":{"dur":0,"text":"And he said,"},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Today, I was telling people\nat the school"},"458":{"dur":3,"text":"that children should\nlearn three languages"},"461":{"dur":1,"text":"before the age of 7"},"463":{"dur":1,"text":"because they are not self-conscious yet,"},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"and they are not afraid\nof making mistakes.\""},"467":{"dur":1,"text":"\"I'm going to tell them that tomorrow.\""},"469":{"dur":0,"text":"(Laughter)"},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"It really happened last night"},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"and I believe it thoroughly."},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"I was thinking that a lot of people"},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"One of the problems is that people seem"},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"to find English superficially easy."},"483":{"dur":1,"text":"So, if you're a little hesitant,"},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"and you're a little scared\nof speaking French,"},"487":{"dur":1,"text":"German, Italian, or whatever,"},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"the person in the other nationality comes"},"492":{"dur":1,"text":"rushing in, English,"},"493":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Don't worry about the French."},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"I speak English.\""},"496":{"dur":1,"text":"And you retreat and say,"},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"wasn't that fine, I did make an effort\nbut, I don't have to try, really."},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"This is wrong."},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"we heard today, as I heard yesterday,"},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"we heard today, being told,"},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"that making mistakes is helpful."},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"Psychologists know we learn\nby making mistakes."},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"Also, in many ways,\nthe speaking of a language,"},"516":{"dur":3,"text":"is not only learning\nthe vocabulary, or the syntax,"},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"it's actually practicing it."},"521":{"dur":1,"text":"It's also a motor skill also."},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"And, you know very well,"},"524":{"dur":3,"text":"you don't improve\na sport except by doing it."},"528":{"dur":3,"text":"You're going to come to a plateau\nand be discouraged,"},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"unless you

culture,"},"539":{"dur":1,"text":"the broadening of your knowledge"},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"of yourself is just so amazing,"},"543":{"dur":0,"text":"and we,"},"544":{"dur":1,"text":"we here today,"},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"are so privileged to be in a city where"},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"we can do this as often as we want,"},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"walking around the streets,"},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"whereas other people have to travel"},"554":{"dur":1,"text":"in order to have the opportunity"},"556":{"dur":1,"text":"to speak another language."},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"So let us profit by our great fortune,"},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"and please,"},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"let us all go in a Tower of Babel"},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"Talking as many languages as we can\nto one another."},"568":{"dur":1,"text":"It's good for our brain,"},"569":{"dur":1,"text":"it's good for our
