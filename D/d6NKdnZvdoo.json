productivity"},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"have been decoupled from increases"},"768":{"dur":1,"text":"in wages and employment."},"769":{"dur":2,"text":"That means that our countries are getting richer,"},"772":{"dur":2,"text":"our companies are getting more efficient,"},"775":{"dur":1,"text":"but we're not creating more jobs"},"777":{"dur":3,"text":"and we're not paying people, as a whole, more."},"781":{"dur":4,"text":"One scary conclusion you could draw from all of this"},"785":{"dur":3,"text":"is to worry about structural unemployment."},"789":{"dur":3,"text":"What worries me more is a different nightmare scenario."},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"After all, in a totally free labor market,"},"795":{"dur":3,"text":"we could find jobs for pretty much everyone."},"798":{"dur":2,"text":"The
