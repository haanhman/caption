great founder."},"396":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, the reason is, is\nbecause what fo,"},"399":{"dur":2,"text":"great founders do is seek the\nnetworks that will be"},"402":{"dur":3,"text":"essential to

here."},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"And so it's actually not a\nsurprise that actually,"},"501":{"dur":4,"text":"in fact, Groupon require, was\nrequired to be actually in"},"505":{"dur":1,"text":"Chicago, which is really good\nat this."},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"As a way of actually kind of\ngetting going, and showing"},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"that even software startups\ncan be in other

a\ngreat idea."},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"Right not saying the fashion\ncompany might be a great idea"},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"but you want the networks that\nsupport what you're doing."},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"And so part of the reason why\nwhere I,"},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"where I locate my startup is a\ntest for thinking"},"548":{"dur":4,"text":"about am I a great founder

so"},"571":{"dur":4,"text":"you're taking every possible\nchance to actually win."},"576":{"dur":1,"text":"And so great founders go,\nlook,"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll move to what the network\nis

things\nyou"},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"should think about whether or\nnot it's a different location."},"593":{"dur":3,"text":"Now here's something that, you\nknow,"},"596":{"dur":1,"text":"it's very in vogue, all right,"},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"very conventional, to say\nyou're contrarian these days."},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, let's talk a little\nbit about what contrarianness"},"606":{"dur":1,"text":"actually in fact is."},"608":{"dur":3,"text":"so, it's actually pretty easy\nto be contrarian."},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"It's hard to be contrarian and\nright."},"613":{"dur":3,"text":"And in particular, when you're\nthinking about,"},"617":{"dur":3,"text":"is my idea contrarian or\ncontrarian enough."},"620":{"dur":4,"text":"It's how does a smart person\nactually disagree with"},"624":{"dur":0,"text":"me right?"},"625":{"dur":3,"text":"Is, because if you can't think\nof a smart person-"},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"Who isn't like ignorant or\njust crazy or isn't, but"},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"is a smart person who is\nsomewhat expert in that so"},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"thinks that your idea has some\nserious challenges,"},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"then it actually isn't\ncontrarian."},"640":{"dur":0,"text":"Right?\nSo contrarian, and"},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"contrarian is also is always,"},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"actually this is one of the\nthings that Sam and"},"644":{"dur":3,"text":"I talked about at startup\nschool is contrarian is"},"647":{"dur":1,"text":"actually relative to an\naudience, right?"},"649":{"dur":0,"text":"So."},"650":{"dur":0,"text":"When you want to be, when\nyou're,"},"651":{"dur":3,"text":"when you're thinking about\ncontrarian in terms of,"},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"like a really good contrarian\nidea is like okay,"},"656":{"dur":3,"text":"what would other, say it's\nconsumer Internet,"},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"good consumer Internet people\nthink is actually in"},"662":{"dur":1,"text":"fact not yet a good idea."},"663":{"dur":3,"text":"And part of what you think\nabout contrarian is to say,"},"667":{"dur":4,"text":"okay, what's the way that what\ndo"},"672":{"dur":3,"text":"I know that other people don't\nknow?"},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"Because it isn't just that I'm\nbrilliant and"},"678":{"dur":1,"text":"other people aren't and"},"679":{"dur":1,"text":"that's reason why contrarian\nthing is right."},"681":{"dur":1,"text":"That's a very bad test."},"682":{"dur":0,"text":"Right, it happened to be true."},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"Of course, lightening could\nalso strike you in the field."},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, so, think a lot\nabout, like,"},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"what is that I know that other\npeople don't know?"},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"So, for example, in the very\nearly days of LinkedIn,"},"692":{"dur":3,"text":"part of what I advised all\nfounders to do was go talk to"},"695":{"dur":1,"text":"every smart person who will\ntalk to you and"},"697":{"dur":1,"text":"give you feedback."},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"So, at LinkedIn I walked\naround and"},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"said here's my idea, what do\nyou think?"},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"Two thirds or more of my\nnetwork, including some of"},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"the very, very smart people,\nall thought I was nuts."},"707":{"dur":1,"text":"And they reason why they\nthought I was nuts was because"},"708":{"dur":1,"text":"they said well look, it's a\nnetwork product, it's only"},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"valuable with a bunch of\npeople in it, first person no"},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"value, invite second person,\nsecond person first person,"},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"no value for either of them,\nthey already know each other."},"716":{"dur":0,"text":"When do you,"},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"when do you actually begin to\ndeliver on your use case."},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"Which is like 500k to a\nmillion people."},"722":{"dur":0,"text":"Right."},"723":{"dur":1,"text":"And so, you're never going to\nget to size,"},"724":{"dur":1,"text":"you're never going to grow."},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"Now what I knew that the\ncritique,"},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"the critics didn't know."},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"Was that I could think of a\nset of different ways by which"},"733":{"dur":1,"text":"people could say, look it's\npretty easy to say, look I"},"734":{"dur":1,"text":"believe in the vision of this,\nor I think it's interesting,"},"736":{"dur":1,"text":"or I think a product like this\nshould exist, or"},"738":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm willing to play around\nwith it and I can use,"},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"leverage, those sets of\ninterests to grow the network,"},"743":{"dur":3,"text":"to get to enough size that you\ncould begin to deliver on"},"746":{"dur":1,"text":"the value propositions in\nwhich LinkedIn had."},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"And that was the specific\nthing that I knew"},"751":{"dur":1,"text":"that the critics weren't\nthinking about."},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"And so when you think about\nbeing contrarian, you have to"},"755":{"dur":2,"text":"think about how is it that\nsmart people disagree with me?"},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"They disagree with me from a\nposition of"},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"intelligence right."},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's something that I\nknow that they don't"},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"know that actually in fact\nwill play out to be true."},"767":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, in this case, in general\nas a, as a founder it's good"},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"to be contrarian in the real\nsense and right."},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"Now the other last part on the\ncontrariness is to think about"},"779":{"dur":1,"text":"there's a lot of different\nways to be contrarian."},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"So for example, a frequent one\nwill be is like, oh yeah,"},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"that's a good small idea but\nactually not so"},"785":{"dur":1,"text":"small it's large."},"787":{"dur":4,"text":"Or you know, actually in fact\nyou can assemble the talent or"},"791":{"dur":3,"text":"while most consumer internet\nstart ups tend to be like for"},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"example, this is another\nLinkedIn example tend to be"},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"only successful through rocket\nships."},"799":{"dur":3,"text":"Actually a gradual compounding\ncurve can actually be very,"},"803":{"dur":1,"text":"very valuable."},"804":{"dur":1,"text":"LinkedIn never had its rocket\nship moment."},"806":{"dur":1,"text":"It was, it was kind of\ncompound year by year."},"807":{"dur":1,"text":"But that in the consumer\ninternet,"},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"tends to be a atypical to the\npattern."},"813":{"dur":3,"text":"So here you begin to get to a\nbunch of sorts of"},"817":{"dur":5,"text":"problems that, essentially\nfounders run into,"},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"which is like, well should I\nbe doing the work or"},"824":{"dur":2,"text":"should be recruiting people\nand delegating the work."},"827":{"dur":2,"text":"And classically the answer to\nthis is,"},"829":{"dur":1,"text":"actually in fact you need to\ndo both."},"831":{"dur":4,"text":"Right, and, in fact, not only\ndo you need to do both,"},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"you need to do sometimes one\nat 100% and"},"838":{"dur":1,"text":"sometimes the

is actually classic"},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"when you begin thinking about\nwhat is a great founder?"},"851":{"dur":3,"text":"Is you navigate what is\napparent paradoxes?"},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"So another one that I\nfrequently talk about is,"},"857":{"dur":2,"text":"you got to be both flexible\nand persistent."},"859":{"dur":1,"text":"And the reason for this
