when we have an idea,\nas Jeff said,"},"1155":{"dur":3,"text":"we can grab a napkin or\na pencil and paper."},"1160":{"dur":2,"text":"It's the 21st century, so\nI'm gonna grab my pen

doing."},"1180":{"dur":2,"text":"All right, so\nwe can click on the pen and"},"1183":{"dur":1,"text":"we could bring up OneNote."},"1185":{"dur":1,"text":"Aren't we familiar with this,\nMicrosoft

that."},"1459":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's move on to another piece\nof software from Siemens."},"1461":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is Solid Edge, this is\nwhat Jeff was talking about."},"1465":{"dur":3,"text":"What we can do is we can take\nexactly this these line that"},"1468":{"dur":4,"text":"kind of lines and circles and\nwhatever that data is and bring"},"1473":{"dur":2,"text":"it into Solid Edge and make\nuse of that, pull it into 3D."},"1475":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's revisit,"},"1478":{"dur":2,"text":"my colleague again who is still\non the

and"},"1487":{"dur":2,"text":"making them into 3D like\nrevolving it around an axis."},"1490":{"dur":3,"text":"Here he is like pushing a spear\ninto it to add a bit of"},"1494":{"dur":2,"text":"You can hollow it out,"},"1496":{"dur":3,"text":"just a whole host of features\nof how you can create shapes."},"1500":{"dur":3,"text":"The key thing here is\nreusing this Catchbook

you can start\nto think of weight,"},"1510":{"dur":1,"text":"central gravity, all that kind."},"1513":{"dur":2,"text":"And dragging areas out\ninto 3D or keep going."},"1515":{"dur":2,"text":"We'll do another revolve\nhere and make that into 3D."},"1521":{"dur":1,"text":"And also get to finish one half,"},"1523":{"dur":3,"text":"of course we can do the same\nas what we did in 2D and"},"1526":{"dur":2,"text":"mirror it across so we can\nmirror all that 3D geometry."},"1529":{"dur":2,"text":"But then we can even simulate\nthe motion of it, so"},"1532":{"dur":1,"text":"you can really understand\nwhat's going on."},"1533":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can see the blade\nthat we just zoomed into."},"1536":{"dur":1,"text":"Though you can not\nadd motors to it, so"},"1538":{"dur":3,"text":"now does that make more,\nmore, makes more sense."},"1542":{"dur":2,"text":"The orange gets rubbed\ninto these two cups."},"1545":{"dur":1,"text":"It gets taken onto\nthat knife blade."},"1547":{"dur":0,"text":"It's split into two."},"1548":{"dur":1,"text":"And then those presses come in."},"1549":{"dur":1,"text":"And they squeeze\nthe juice out of it."},"1551":{"dur":2,"text":"So does that make a bit\nmore sense now, a bit"},"1554":{"dur":2,"text":"better than this, kind of get an\nidea of how this is gonna work."},"1557":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's how Solid Edge can\nhelp in kinda take an idea and"},"1561":{"dur":0,"text":"developing it into 3D."},"1562":{"dur":3,"text":"So the key thing that maybe\nyou slightly missed there,"},"1566":{"dur":1,"text":"that was still all\nin the Surface Pro."},"1567":{"dur":3,"text":"So the Surface Pro we\nfound it to be awesome and"},"1570":{"dur":2,"text":"our customers feel the same,\nthat it doesn't just do this"},"1573":{"dur":3,"text":"kind of maybe simpler,\njust lines on a piece of paper,"},"1577":{"dur":2,"text":"but it works with\nthese full 3D models."},"1580":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact so much so,\nlet me pull it up right now."},"1585":{"dur":2,"text":"So let's open up\nSolid Edge here."},"1588":{"dur":5,"text":"I can click into using like\na docking station with this."},"1594":{"dur":2,"text":"Plug in a mouse,\nuse it that way if I wish."},"1596":{"dur":2,"text":"Or, I can still use my fingers\nto gesture it to zoom in

full screen."},"1672":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's the same thing\nthat was in Solid Edge."},"1675":{"dur":3,"text":"And I can manipulate this,\nI can rotate it round,"},"1678":{"dur":3,"text":"have a look at the details\nof it, zoom in and out."},"1681":{"dur":3,"text":"If we wanted to collaborate on\nthis in terms of the design,"},"1685":{"dur":3,"text":"maybe we want a different LED
