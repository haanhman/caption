I'm here and I feel like\neveryone else is around here"},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"in terms of skill level,\nwell, then I can do more.\""},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"So I went to apprentice\nunder Charlie

do\nanger management well."},"3491":{"dur":1,"text":"We think we're pretty temperate,"},"3492":{"dur":2,"text":"but we don't teach the class--\nthat's not our forte,"},"3495":{"dur":2,"text":"so we have an agency\nthat would do that no problem."},"3498":{"dur":2,"text":"The same thing goes\nwith literacy and et cetera,"},"3500":{"dur":2,"text":"but any time there's\nan old habit that flares up,"},"3503":{"dur":1,"text":"it's--you have to understand,"},"3505":{"dur":2,"text":"one, someone is there\n40 to 50 hours a week,"},"3508":{"dur":3,"text":"and we're able to gauge\non how someone works,"},"3511":{"dur":2,"text":"how they're doing in life."},"3514":{"dur":1,"text":"So if someone's got\nlike a really down day,"},"3515":{"dur":1,"text":"it's like we notice that\nbecause we're

on?"},"3528":{"dur":1,"text":"You're not usually like this.\""},"3529":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's about listening,"},"3531":{"dur":1,"text":"it's about finding out\nwhat the problem is,"},"3533":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's about\nfinding the solution"},"3534":{"dur":2,"text":"to help that problem subside."},"3537":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's very boutique,\nit's very hands-on,"},"3538":{"dur":2,"text":"but it revolves around care."},"3541":{"dur":2,"text":"So yeah, we do see it,\nbut we attack it,"},"3544":{"dur":2,"text":"and we solve it."},"3546":{"dur":1,"text":"Really good question."},"3555":{"dur":3,"text":"So if 100 graduate\nand double that..."},"3559":{"dur":1,"text":"lose about ten percent,"},"3560":{"dur":2,"text":"so we

again,"},"3568":{"dur":1,"text":"and then once\nthe three weeks pass,"},"3570":{"dur":2,"text":"we only lose\nabout five, ten percent."},"3572":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's very successful\nafter
