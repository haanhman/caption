lot."},"575":{"dur":5,"text":"But anyway, when we finally got there, this\nchurch had been shaped around those years"},"580":{"dur":6,"text":"of teaching the Word of God, and the key men\nin

putting it together."},"693":{"dur":4,"text":"But I worked my way through that book because\nit was a biblical ecclesiology and it became"},"698":{"dur":5,"text":"kind of my pattern to understand because it\nwas purely based on what the New Testament"},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"taught."},"704":{"dur":5,"text":"And so I cancelled out all the past and all\nof the different forms of church polity
