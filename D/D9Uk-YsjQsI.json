could."},"503":{"dur":5,"text":"And so the fact that people\nare incapable of figuring out"},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"how much they need to\nsave for retirement"},"511":{"dur":4,"text":"doesn't matter as long as\nthey behave as if they can."},"515":{"dur":9,"text":"And this was taken to-- this was\na winning argument for 30 years"},"524":{"dur":3,"text":"until two psychologists named\nDaniel

people"},"539":{"dur":3,"text":"make predictable mistakes."},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"So for example, they coined\nthe term \"the availability"},"545":{"dur":4,"text":"heuristic,\" which is when\npeople

think"},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"of lots of examples of them."},"564":{"dur":5,"text":"John is a common name, and you\nknow lots of people named John,"},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"but it sometimes\ncan lead you astray."},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"So for example,\npeople think there"},"574":{"dur":4,"text":"are more homicides than suicides\nwhen, in fact, there are"},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"about twice as many suicides."},"581":{"dur":4,"text":"But homicides get more press,\nand so they're more available."},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"And so we make a mistake."},"587":{"dur":5,"text":"And this example illustrates\na simple refutation"},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"of the as if argument, or\nthe more general argument"},"596":{"dur":1,"text":"that we don't care\nwhether people"},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"make mistakes, because\nif they cancel out,"},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"we'll still be right."},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"And the point is,\nthey don't cancel out,"},"606":{"dur":1,"text":"because the errors\nare systematic."},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"Another argument I\ngot for many years"},"613":{"dur":4,"text":"is, OK, you run some\nexperiment, and people screw up,"},"618":{"dur":4,"text":"but if we get the\nstakes high enough,"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"then people will get it right."},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"And another argument\nI would hear-- often"},"627":{"dur":6,"text":"from the same person-- would\nbe, and in your experiment,"},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"there's no real\nopportunity to learn."},"636":{"dur":3,"text":"So I ask you the homicide\nsuicide question once,"},"640":{"dur":1,"text":"and you get it wrong."},"641":{"dur":5,"text":"But if I asked you 100 times and\npresumably told you the answer,"},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"then you'd get it right."},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'd hear these two arguments."},"650":{"dur":4,"text":"And in fact, once\nat a conference,"},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"I was hearing both of\nthose from an economist"},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"called Ken Binmore."},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"And it caused me to\ncreate what I now"},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"call the Binmore\ncontinuum, which"},"665":{"dur":7,"text":"is-- think about the frequency\nwith which you buy stuff."},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's some stuff\nlike milk that you"},"675":{"dur":4,"text":"buy almost every time you\ngo to the grocery store."},"680":{"dur":6,"text":"Then suits-- maybe once a year."},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"More often, I guess, if you\nhave to wear them

reducing the number\nof times you get to do it."},"720":{"dur":4,"text":"So in fact, there's\nsimply no reason"},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"to think that when\nthe stakes go up,"},"727":{"dur":4,"text":"people are going to get it right\nmore often, because they've"},"732":{"dur":3,"text":"had no opportunity to learn."},"735":{"dur":3,"text":"Another argument I would\nhear is, well, look,"},"738":{"dur":2,"text":"if the stakes are\nhigh enough, people"},"741":{"dur":3,"text":"will hire some\nexpert to help them."},"744":{"dur":5,"text":"But here are three examples\nof high stakes decisions."},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"Do we really think experts\nare jumping in and helping"},"753":{"dur":4,"text":"people make great decisions?"},"758":{"dur":0,"text":"I don't think so."},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"The whole financial\ncrisis really"},"764":{"dur":5,"text":"was caused by-- it started at\nthe bottom of mortgage brokers"},"770":{"dur":3,"text":"who were being paid

know\nyou think is an idiot,"},"897":{"dur":4,"text":"but the agents in your\nmodels are geniuses."},"902":{"dur":0,"text":"What gives?"},"905":{"dur":6,"text":"And Mike was nonplussed\nby this

is\nprobably the smartest person"},"923":{"dur":3,"text":"There's hardly anything he\ndidn't understand or couldn't"},"927":{"dur":1,"text":"understand."},"929":{"dur":4,"text":"So what is it that Jensen\nthought he didn't understand?"},"934":{"dur":3,"text":"He didn't understand markets."},"937":{"dur":5,"text":"And Jensen launched\ninto what, in the book,"},"943":{"dur":3,"text":"I call the invisible hand wave."},"946":{"dur":3,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"951":{"dur":3,"text":"Here's the way the invisible\nhand wave argument goes."},"959":{"dur":5,"text":"Yeah, in your laboratories,\npeople

still."},"978":{"dur":3,"text":"It's simply not\npossible to do it."},"981":{"dur":6,"text":"So what exactly is\ngoing to happen?"},"988":{"dur":4,"text":"Suppose that I choose\nthe wrong career."},"995":{"dur":1,"text":"I probably did\nbecoming an economist."},"1000":{"dur":2,"text":"And what can you do about it?"},"1003":{"dur":2,"text":"You can't short my
