stories."},"314":{"dur":5,"text":"The initial plan was that\nwe would improvise or find"},"320":{"dur":4,"text":"formulas to turn people's\nstories into movement"},"324":{"dur":3,"text":"and choreographically develop\nthat, and show the process,"},"328":{"dur":2,"text":"and then create a performance\nat the end of an evening."},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"So the whole thing happens from\nwhen

the work, which is\nthree, four, maybe five"},"387":{"dur":3,"text":"months, two systems--\na choreographic system"},"390":{"dur":1,"text":"and a digital system."},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"And we were

the\nfirst public test--"},"467":{"dur":4,"text":"it kind of changed in a big\nway for lots of reasons."},"472":{"dur":5,"text":"And what happened\nwas initially--"},"477":{"dur":4,"text":"because the marketing\nmaterial had to be ready"},"481":{"dur":3,"text":"months in advance-- the brochure\nwas going out-- the venue"},"485":{"dur":1,"text":"marketing department\nwere talking to us"},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"about what is it\nthat you're doing."},"488":{"dur":1,"text":"And we're saying,\nwell, we're research,"},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"and we want to test\nit with the

until\nwe get on the stage"},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"and the audience starts\nusing their phones"},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"to share their stories with us."},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"And then they were saying, well,\nwhat do we put in the brochure"},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"And it was really\ndifficult to try and get"},"510":{"dur":3,"text":"the venue to understand\nwhat we were trying to do."},"513":{"dur":1,"text":"The venue itself\nwas too big really."},"515":{"dur":1,"text":"We wanted it to\nbe in the studio."},"516":{"dur":1,"text":"It didn't happen that way."},"518":{"dur":4,"text":"And things happened, like,\nwhen the doors opened,"},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"and we were ready for\nthe audience to come in,"},"524":{"dur":1,"text":"there was an announcement\nasking people"},"526":{"dur":1,"text":"to turn off their\nmobile phones--"},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"--which we had no control over."},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"Somebody had just gone\nbackstage and pressed a button."},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"And that kind of confused\npeople from the outset."},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"538":{"dur":3,"text":"What we did, we'd spend a week\non stage with various students."},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"We tend to work quite closely\nwith a dance degree course."},"545":{"dur":3,"text":"And we'd been developing\nhow the movement--"},"549":{"dur":1,"text":"the choreographic\nsystem-- would work."},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"And the guys from\nMoon were there"},"552":{"dur":1,"text":"at the same time\nthroughout the week,"},"553":{"dur":4,"text":"making sure that the system was\nrobust enough, and testing it."},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"And then we opened up\non the Friday night."},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"And we had 130 people\nin, which is fantastic."},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"And the system

was\nactually too complicated."},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"What we had done, we\ndesigned it all on paper"},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"and then replicated that\nthroughout the

color-coded,"},"604":{"dur":1,"text":"each would choose a story."},"605":{"dur":5,"text":"That story was\nallocated to a colour."},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"So the audience could\nuse their devices"},"613":{"dur":5,"text":"to find out how the\ndancers were transforming"},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"their story into movement."},"620":{"dur":4,"text":"And they were using a formula\nlike this, which instantly"},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"abstracted, because we didn't\nwant the dancers to be miming"},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"the stories."},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"So it became a very abstract\nchoreographic process"},"633":{"dur":4,"text":"whereby they split\nthe story into words"},"637":{"dur":3,"text":"and then moved different\nbody parts according to where"},"640":{"dur":2,"text":"the words fall in the story."},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"And then we were adding\nemotional stuff later on."},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"We thought we were\nbeing clever about it."},"648":{"dur":3,"text":"But it was a little bit\ntoo clever in the end."},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"Throughout the\ncourse of the event,"},"655":{"dur":1,"text":"people's phones would\nvibrate, and then they"},"657":{"dur":4,"text":"would be asked to attach\nan icon to each group."},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"So we had, like,\ncolor-coded icons coming up."},"664":{"dur":4,"text":"And these all meant a lot to us."},"675":{"dur":1,"text":"The voting was coming\nup on the screen,"},"676":{"dur":1,"text":"and everybody could see\ntheir votes instantly,"},"678":{"dur":1,"text":"which was quite nice feedback."},"680":{"dur":5,"text":"If the blue group had-- say,\nthe snake was voted for."},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"Then they would\ndevelop their movement"},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"into something that was\nkind of lower and slower."},"690":{"dur":3,"text":"And a butterfly would have\na different kind of dynamic."},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"So we looked at dynamics,\nspacing, and grouping."},"697":{"dur":1,"text":"And throughout the\ncourse of the event,"},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"the audience were\nbombarded with these icons."},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"We thought what\nthey'd do, if they"},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"see how an icon is\nattached to the movement,"},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"and then they can\nwatch the process,"},"708":{"dur":1,"text":"watch the movement develop."},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"They can sort of make the\nconnection for themselves,"},"711":{"dur":1,"text":"and kind of get the\njoke, and work out"},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"what we're talking\nabout with pictures"},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"of fleas and sperms and stuff."},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"But what happened was,\neverybody voted for sperms,"},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"because everybody liked sperms."},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"726":{"dur":1,"text":"And we had this\nother thing, as well,"},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"whereby every now and again,\nbecause I was controlling"},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"the sound and the video\nand the lighting on stage,"},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"but every now and again, I'd\nsend controls to the audience."},"737":{"dur":3,"text":"So one member of the audience\nwould get a slider that said,"},"740":{"dur":3,"text":"you are now in\ncontrol of the sound."},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"And technologically,\nit was really nice,"},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"because they could control\nelements of the sound"},"749":{"dur":0,"text":"from their phone."},"750":{"dur":1,"text":"But what they did was,\nthey got the slider,"},"752":{"dur":1,"text":"they went, oh,\nwhat does this do."},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not doing\nanything, because there"},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"were just too many variables."},"758":{"dur":1,"text":"And it was all a\nlittle too loose."},"760":{"dur":1,"text":"It wasn't specific enough."},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"So what we ended up with at\nthe end of the night was this."},"765":{"dur":1,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"768":{"dur":4,"text":"In fact, no, the feedback\nwe got-- we spoke to people."},"773":{"dur":1,"text":"The venue had put\nchalkboards out,"},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"which was kind of\nincongruous technologically."},"778":{"dur":3,"text":"But it worked, because the\npeople that hated it and were"},"782":{"dur":1,"text":"in and out to the\nbar and storming off"},"783":{"dur":3,"text":"to go home and stuff, they\nwrote why they hated it"},"787":{"dur":0,"text":"on the blackboard."},"788":{"dur":1,"text":"And then the people\nthat stayed to the end"},"789":{"dur":1,"text":"and really enjoyed\nthe performance"},"791":{"dur":2,"text":"and enjoyed the process,\nwhich was generally"},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"dance people that kind\nof understood it--"},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"so they weren't the target\naudience-- but they were,"},"798":{"dur":1,"text":"like, this is great,\nyou just didn't get it."},"800":{"dur":2,"text":"You didn't get it all\nall, because we loved it."},"802":{"dur":5,"text":"So what we did is, we\nlistened to those people"},"808":{"dur":1,"text":"who were our target\naudience-- those people that"},"810":{"dur":1,"text":"had never been to see dance."},"812":{"dur":4,"text":"And we realised that, actually,\nyeah, we'd made some

failure,"},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"which is quite hard for us,\nbecause it was in our hometown."},"832":{"dur":1,"text":"And there was quite\na good audience."},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"And as the artistic\norganisation,"},"837":{"dur":3,"text":"our name was attached\nquite heavily to it."},"840":{"dur":4,"text":"And we had another show in\nthe same space a month

the first one"},"851":{"dur":4,"text":"and come back and see something\nthat was a little bit more"},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"polished, a bit more artistic."},"857":{"dur":2,"text":"So what we had to\ndo, what we found"},"860":{"dur":3,"text":"worked best was to\ncommunicate with these people."},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"And we instantly\nstarted blogging"},"865":{"dur":4,"text":"about how we had failed, and\nthe decisions that we'd made,"},"869":{"dur":3,"text":"and how the feedback\nfrom the audience"},"872":{"dur":5,"text":"could inform how we then\ntake it on and do

difficult."},"910":{"dur":1,"text":"And we thought we\nwere OK with it."},"911":{"dur":2,"text":"But then, finally, when lots of\nthings went wrong, and the fact"},"914":{"dur":3,"text":"that we were

barriers,"},"923":{"dur":1,"text":"because the system\nkept breaking,"},"924":{"dur":2,"text":"and people were just\ngetting pissed off with it."},"927":{"dur":2,"text":"So we went back to\nsquare one, and we"},"930":{"dur":5,"text":"told everybody-- we got in touch\nwith some of the people who'd"},"935":{"dur":2,"text":"been quite vocal on\nTwitter during the-- they"},"938":{"dur":3,"text":"couldn't actually be vocal\non Twitter during the event,"},"942":{"dur":1,"text":"because we had set it\nup as a closed network."},"944":{"dur":2,"text":"So they couldn't get\non to social media."},"946":{"dur":1,"text":"As soon as they\ngot into the bar,"},"948":{"dur":3,"text":"they sort of reset their DNS\nand did complicated things

these are\npeople that we can talk to."},"961":{"dur":3,"text":"And we had meetings with\npeople who had given feedback."},"964":{"dur":3,"text":"And somebody wrote an essay\nfor us of all the
