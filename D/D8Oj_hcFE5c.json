turns out,"},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"because of these virtual particles\nbeing everywhere,"},"371":{"dur":3,"text":"to depend on particles\nthat don't exist in the usual

0.9 GeV."},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"So, these particles are much heavier\nthan the proton,"},"430":{"dur":4,"text":"even though they're much smaller."},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, when they're made,\nthey're very unstable"},"436":{"dur":2,"text":"and they decay almost instantly."},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"And we can see the tracks\nof the decay products"},"441":{"dur":4,"text":"and we can see

count the number of events\nat different mass values,"},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"you'd expect to find a peak."},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"This is what\na particle resonance looks like,"},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"a peak at the mass of 91.1."},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"And then there's some background\nfrom other things."},"475":{"dur":5,"text":"Now let me show you\nwhat we actually see \u2013 this is it."},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"The black dots show our measurements."},"482":{"dur":3,"text":"So the Z and the W were exactly\nas we predicted they would be,"},"486":{"dur":5,"text":"and this really made us take this idea\nof the Higgs very seriously."},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"Now there are fundamental connections\nbetween particles"},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"and this is where\nit gets kind of interesting."},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"Fundamental particles actually\nall interact with each other all the time,"},"499":{"dur":4,"text":"through these virtual reality\nkind of interactions that I mentioned."},"504":{"dur":3,"text":"So the mass of the W particle,\nfor instance, depends a lot on the mass"},"507":{"dur":3,"text":"of the top quark and a little bit\non the mass of the Higgs."},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"And it is through \nthis kind of a process"},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"a W can decay into a top \nand a bottom quark,"},"517":{"dur":4,"text":"and then those can fuse back together\nand become a W again."},"521":{"dur":4,"text":"A W can radiate a Higgs and re-absorb it\nand become a W again."},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"These things are happening all the time."},"528":{"dur":3,"text":"Basically the identity of any\nof these elementary particles"},"532":{"dur":4,"text":"is really not

a good way to visualize it."},"545":{"dur":5,"text":"The vacuum of space-time\nis really a very interesting place."},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"Imagine that you have\nkind of an invisible fabric,"},"552":{"dur":3,"text":"that cloaks all these particles\nthat could exist"},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"and encodes how they could interact."},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"That's really what space-time is."},"559":{"dur":5,"text":"Not anything can happen in space-time,\nonly these kind of things."},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"These virtual particles are always waiting"},"567":{"dur":4,"text":"for an opportunity to interact\nwith real particles."},"571":{"dur":4,"text":"So if you provide enough energy\nin a very small region,"},"575":{"dur":4,"text":"you can pull particles\nfrom this fabric into our reality."},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"And to some extent\nthat's exactly what we do."},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact if the energy is large enough,\nwe can pull up particles"},"585":{"dur":3,"text":"that are very heavy, \nthat we've never seen before."},"589":{"dur":5,"text":"And these are the keys to understanding\nthe underlying code of our universe."},"594":{"dur":4,"text":"So, how do you get a lot of energy\nin one small spot?"},"598":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, we do it with what we call:\n\"Large Hadron Collider\"."},"603":{"dur":4,"text":"Let me show you that,\n[I] have a nice picture of it."},"611":{"dur":5,"text":"Basically we have rings of magnets\nthat focus beams and circulate them."},"617":{"dur":4,"text":"Each time they go round we give them \na little acceleration with an electric field."},"621":{"dur":3,"text":"And then when they get energetic enough\nwe switch them to another ring that's bigger,"},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"we can make the particles accelerate\nto even higher energies"},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"and then finally to this yellow one\nwhich is the Large Hadron Collider."},"630":{"dur":3,"text":"And it shows you the scale of things,\n100 meters underground."},"634":{"dur":4,"text":"It took a long time\nto paint those stripes by the way."},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"And here's another view of it,"},"640":{"dur":3,"text":"and you can now get kind of a sense\nof how big it is, because you can see"},"644":{"dur":3,"text":"Geneva airport, there,\nit's really quite a huge machine."},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"And it is so huge\nbecause the particles are accelerated"},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"to such high energies\nthat the magnets"},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"are limited in how well\nthey can keep them on track."},"656":{"dur":4,"text":"So we have to build a very big machine,\nand there we have four experiments."},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"Two of them I'll talk about a little bit today:\nmy experiments at CMS,"},"663":{"dur":4,"text":"or an experiment I'm part of,\nI don't own it, and ATLAS."},"667":{"dur":3,"text":"But there are couple of others,\nLHCb and ALICE"},"670":{"dur":4,"text":"that are very dedicated to very specific things\nand I won't go into those."},"674":{"dur":5,"text":"It's a bit like Swiss chocolate;\nI'll let you think about that for a second."},"680":{"dur":3,"text":"The LHC magnets that keep\nthe particles on their track,"},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"they store a huge amount of energy."},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact, it's enough\nto melt 12 tons of copper,"},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"that's how much energy\nthere is in these magnets."},"690":{"dur":4,"text":"It is the kinetic energy\nof an A380 at 700 km\/h."},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"How much energy is stored\nin the actual beams?"},"697":{"dur":6,"text":"Well, it's equivalent to 90kg of TNT\nor 15kg of chocolate."},"704":{"dur":5,"text":"I bet you didn't know that chocolate\nhas more calories than TNT."},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"OK, now let me tell you\nabout the experiments."},"711":{"dur":1,"text":"The experiments are very big"},"712":{"dur":3,"text":"because we ram these protons together\nat really high energy."},"716":{"dur":3,"text":"Things can come out at really high energy\nand we want to measure those things."},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"We have to build\nvery, very large experiments"},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"to be able to bend the particle tracks\nin magnetic fields"},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"and actually measure their momenta."},"728":{"dur":4,"text":"So here's ATLAS and I'll show you\nhow it looked as it was being built."},"732":{"dur":4,"text":"This is 30 storeys underground"},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"and there you see\na person standing amids it."},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"Now lots get filled in here in fact"},"743":{"dur":3,"text":"and I'll show you in fact\nwith CMS a little bit more."},"746":{"dur":3,"text":"ATLAS is just like CMS in the sense\nthat there's about 40 countries involved,"},"750":{"dur":5,"text":"hundreds of institutions\nand thousands of physicists."},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"So CMS, this is the experiment\nI'm heading right now,"},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"we had to build it on the surface\nand then lower it."},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"And this piece right here,\nthe central piece of the experiment,"},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"is 4.4 million pounds"},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"and had to be lowered 30 stories\nwith only, if you look there,"},"772":{"dur":4,"text":"we had 3 inches of clearance,\nso it was quite tricky to do that."},"776":{"dur":2,"text":"And here, this sets the scale,\nif you go back to this picture,"},"779":{"dur":4,"text":"you see the magnets, comes hard to tell\nhow big this giant solenoid magnet is,"},"784":{"dur":4,"text":"if come here you can see, it's quite big,\nit's the largest magnet ever built."},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"We also recycled some things to build,"},"792":{"dur":3,"text":"actually old casings\nfrom the Russian military,"},"795":{"dur":4,"text":"were made into\nparts of our experiment."},"799":{"dur":6,"text":"And here I show what's happening \nas we're inserting the central tracking system."},"806":{"dur":3,"text":"OK, and then this is the picture\nI showed at the beginning,"},"809":{"dur":1,"text":"this is when the detector\nwas ready to close"},"811":{"dur":3,"text":"this is actually the beam line here \u2013\nOK?"},"814":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's where the protons go\nand then they collide"},"817":{"dur":3,"text":"in the center of the detector\nwhich is a bit over here to the left."},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"OK, there are a lot of people involved,"},"824":{"dur":3,"text":"this is 1\/8th of the people\nthat were involved in the CMS experiment."},"827":{"dur":2,"text":"And as the presenter mentioned\nbefore me"},"829":{"dur":3,"text":"there were about 4000 people\ninvolved altogether."},"832":{"dur":5,"text":"OK, so how do we reconstruct\nwhat happens in a collision?"},"837":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the detector looked at end on"},"840":{"dur":3,"text":"and you notice it's kind of got\na lot of cylinders involved."},"844":{"dur":3,"text":"And if I replace it with a cartoon,\nyou can see this."},"847":{"dur":2,"text":"All the different cylinders\nare different kinds of detectors"},"849":{"dur":3,"text":"that detect different properties of the particles \nas they pass through them."},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"And when we sum up all the information\nfrom all the different layers,"},"856":{"dur":4,"text":"we can tell if they're pions,\nmuons, kaons, etc."},"861":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's how we reconstruct\nthese things."},"863":{"dur":3,"text":"Now we collide these two beams\nof protons, as I mentioned,"},"866":{"dur":5,"text":"each beam has 1380 bunches,\neach bunch has 160 billion protons."},"872":{"dur":3,"text":"Lots of numbers,\nthey collide 4 different places,"},"876":{"dur":1,"text":"and whenever they cross,"},"877":{"dur":2,"text":"even though there's a 160 billion protons\nin each bunch,"},"880":{"dur":4,"text":"you only get about 20 or 30 pairs\nof protons that collide."},"885":{"dur":2,"text":"And usually what happens is,\nthey just break up."},"887":{"dur":3,"text":"The proton breaks up,\nthe quarks go flying out,"},"890":{"dur":3,"text":"and you make new particles,\nbut it's not very interesting."},"893":{"dur":2,"text":"Sometimes though,\nit gets very interesting."},"895":{"dur":6,"text":"Let me just show you a simple event,\nthis is our first event of the 2012 era,"},"902":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is a real event,\neverything you're seeing now is simulated,"},"904":{"dur":3,"text":"but you'll see what the event actually\nlooks like when the two bunches cross \u2013"},"907":{"dur":2,"text":"Here's 30 pairs of protons fly,"},"910":{"dur":2,"text":"and those are the tracks\nof the particles coming out,"},"913":{"dur":2,"text":"and the blue represent energy deposits"},"915":{"dur":3,"text":"in the energy measuring part \nof the experiment."},"922":{"dur":2,"text":"OK, we're done, come on."},"931":{"dur":4,"text":"Aha good, I can't see \nwe get past this one."},"935":{"dur":4,"text":"Ah, very good.\nNow, if two quarks inside hit very hard,"},"939":{"dur":4,"text":"you can have so much energy that\nyou can produce something really interesting."},"944":{"dur":3,"text":"Here I show for instance a diagram\nof two quarks interacting,"},"947":{"dur":3,"text":"forming a very energetic gluon\nand then decaying to top quarks."},"950":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, you've not seen\nthese kind of diagrams before,"},"955":{"dur":1,"text":"but if I showed you\nthe masses involved,"},"956":{"dur":2,"text":"it's kinda like throwing\n2 ping-pong balls at each other,"},"959":{"dur":2,"text":"and having 2 bowling balls come out,"},"961":{"dur":3,"text":"as the top quarks\nare so much more massive."},"964":{"dur":4,"text":"Let me show you the lead-lead collision,\nthis is just fun."},"969":{"dur":1,"text":"Now we're throwing 2 lead atoms\nat each other,"},"971":{"dur":3,"text":"so you have 400 protons\nand neutrons colliding."},"974":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's what that looks like."},"984":{"dur":5,"text":"So, we often talk about these detectors\nas something like a camera."},"989":{"dur":5,"text":"They have about 80 million pixels,\nbut they're not ordinary cameras."},"995":{"dur":4,"text":"They take up to 40 million pictures per

are\nthat these collisions are very frequent."},"1014":{"dur":3,"text":"Right now\nthere's about 16 million per second"},"1018":{"dur":3,"text":"and the things we're looking for\nare really rare."},"1021":{"dur":3,"text":"So the Higgs events we're looking for,\nsome are 1 in a trillion."},"1025":{"dur":3,"text":"So we have to run a long time,\ncontinuously round the
