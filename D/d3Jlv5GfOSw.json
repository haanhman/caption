it."},"36":{"dur":6,"text":"So let's just dive right in because we don't\nhave a ton of time."},"43":{"dur":5,"text":"My first question kind of relates to what's\nhappening at AEI amongst some of our younger"},"48":{"dur":1,"text":"people."},"49":{"dur":4,"text":"It's graduate school application time."},"53":{"dur":4,"text":"We are in the quarter-life crisis period right\nnow, and that's starting to resolve itself"},"58":{"dur":5,"text":"a little bit, and people are getting ready\nfor their graduate school deadlines."},"64":{"dur":4,"text":"You've had a really varied career, but it\nstarted as a physician, and I was wondering"},"68":{"dur":3,"text":"if you could just let us know why you wanted\nto become a physician."},"72":{"dur":5,"text":"Sue: Oh, I wanted to become a physician because\nI wanted to help patients."},"77":{"dur":7,"text":"I was very motivated by my experience growing\nup with my dad, who is a pharmacist, and our"},"85":{"dur":4,"text":"family doctor, Noah Smirnoff, who was just\na terrific guy."},"89":{"dur":5,"text":"And seeing Dr. Smirnoff and my dad and their\ninteraction with people, and how much they"},"94":{"dur":3,"text":"helped people was a big motivator for me."},"98":{"dur":6,"text":"And then as I got older, I knew that I loved\nscience and I loved math, and so going to"},"105":{"dur":3,"text":"medical school, I also got to take the classes\nI liked the most."},"108":{"dur":1,"text":"Michael: Well, that helps."},"109":{"dur":2,"text":"Sue: Which was useful, yeah."},"112":{"dur":6,"text":"Michael: You credit moving to Uganda in 1989\nto work on HIV\/AIDS and cancer, as a major"},"118":{"dur":1,"text":"turning point in your life."},"120":{"dur":3,"text":"Why did you make that move in the first place?"},"123":{"dur":9,"text":"Sue: In 1982, I became an intern in San Francisco,\nand in 1981, HIV\/AIDS was first described."},"133":{"dur":6,"text":"So like a lot of trainees in the '80s, my\nexperience as a young doctor was incredibly"},"139":{"dur":2,"text":"impacted by the HIV epidemic."},"142":{"dur":6,"text":"And my specialty as an oncologist was Kaposi\nsarcoma, the cancer that affects HIV\/AIDS"},"148":{"dur":1,"text":"infected patients."},"150":{"dur":6,"text":"And so when the world started to get worried\nabout heterosexual transmission of HIV infection,"},"156":{"dur":5,"text":"the Rockefeller Foundation funded UCSF to\nstudy heterosexual transmission in Sub-Saharan"},"162":{"dur":5,"text":"Africa, and UC San Francisco loaned my husband,\nNick Hellmann, an infectious disease doctor,"},"168":{"dur":6,"text":"and I, to Makerere University in Kampala,\nUganda, to start to understand what was going"},"174":{"dur":5,"text":"on, that was very different than the experience\nin the U.S. had been so far with the main"},"180":{"dur":3,"text":"population affected being gay men."},"183":{"dur":2,"text":"Michael: That's fascinating."},"186":{"dur":1,"text":"And so that's how you got there."},"187":{"dur":1,"text":"Sue: That's how I got there."},"188":{"dur":4,"text":"Michael: And it seems like there was a lot\nof circumstance that kind of led you there."},"192":{"dur":3,"text":"Once you were there, why did it become such\na turning point for you?"},"195":{"dur":5,"text":"Sue: In every way, it changed how I thought\nabout the world."},"201":{"dur":2,"text":"It changed how I thought about poverty."},"203":{"dur":3,"text":"It changed how I thought about myself."},"207":{"dur":8,"text":"I was able to be a leader in Uganda in ways\nthat in a big university, just didn't happen"},"215":{"dur":1,"text":"spontaneously."},"217":{"dur":7,"text":"And I think the combination of those things,\ngetting to be a leader and seeing how much"},"225":{"dur":8,"text":"human potential was really not able to live\nup to their capabilities because of that extreme"},"233":{"dur":5,"text":"poverty, that extreme disadvantage, I think\nI just held myself accountable for making"},"238":{"dur":5,"text":"a difference in the world in ways that just\ndidn't feel real for me before I had that"},"243":{"dur":1,"text":"experience."},"244":{"dur":1,"text":"Michael: I see."},"246":{"dur":3,"text":"The Gates Foundation strives to advance a\nvision of the world in which every person"},"250":{"dur":4,"text":"has the opportunity to lead a healthy life."},"254":{"dur":1,"text":"What do you mean by health?"},"256":{"dur":1,"text":"Sue: Ah."},"258":{"dur":9,"text":"The most important thing that we mean by health\nis not to be threatened, especially from an"},"267":{"dur":4,"text":"early age, by things that are so consequential."},"272":{"dur":7,"text":"So it just doesn't seem right to us that any\nchild should suffer or die from a vaccine-preventable"},"279":{"dur":1,"text":"disease."},"281":{"dur":4,"text":"That shouldn't happen in 2016, much less ever."},"285":{"dur":4,"text":"So we're obsessed with vaccines in a very\npositive way."},"289":{"dur":6,"text":"A vaccine-preventable disease might mean for\na few pennies, a child can go without measles,"},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"rubella, diarrheal disease, pneumonia."},"298":{"dur":2,"text":"These are things that really have meaning\nfor us."},"301":{"dur":6,"text":"We invest in nutrition

than"},"312":{"dur":5,"text":"you would be, but your cognitive development,\nis not as much as it should be."},"317":{"dur":6,"text":"So what we mean by health is stacking the\ndeck in favor of that child being able to"},"324":{"dur":6,"text":"thrive, being able to learn, to have a job,\nto go to school, to have a life that we think"},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"anybody should have the possibility for."},"333":{"dur":4,"text":"Michael: Listening to your answer, which is\nvery compelling, it reminds me of some conversations"},"338":{"dur":5,"text":"I've had recently with parents of newborns\nabout vaccinations here in the United States."},"343":{"dur":4,"text":"And I've read some news reports that whooping\ncough is breaking out in some parts of the"},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"country which is really troubling."},"349":{"dur":4,"text":"Do you have any thoughts you'd like to share\non vaccinations here at home?"},"354":{"dur":6,"text":"Sue: Actually, vaccinations and health prevention\nmeasures are something that as a public health"},"360":{"dur":7,"text":"person myself, I think it's really, it's so\nimportant not to get complacent."},"367":{"dur":4,"text":"And something that I think has happened in\nthe U.S. is a certain amount of complacency"},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"about vaccine-preventable illnesses."},"375":{"dur":4,"text":"Things like measles, things like whooping\ncough, we tend to take for granted that those"},"379":{"dur":5,"text":"aren't problems anymore, and in most communities,\nthey aren't problems because of vaccines."},"385":{"dur":6,"text":"So it takes vaccination to prevent those diseases,\nwhich feels obvious, but if too many people"},"391":{"dur":6,"text":"opt out of vaccines, then we actually have\na troubling fact, which is, what should be"},"398":{"dur":5,"text":"completely gone, like measles, like whooping\ncough, from places like the United States,"},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"can come back, and come back fast and furious."},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"Michael: That makes perfect sense."},"408":{"dur":3,"text":"Let me talk a little about your career."},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"You've had an extremely successful private\nsector career."},"414":{"dur":5,"text":"You helped develop two of the first gene-targeted\ntherapies for cancer, you were named by Forbes"},"420":{"dur":4,"text":"as one of the world's seven most powerful\ninnovators in 2009, and for seven years, you"},"424":{"dur":3,"text":"were listed among Fortune's top 50 most powerful\nwomen in business."},"428":{"dur":3,"text":"A lot of power there."},"431":{"dur":6,"text":"So you were really at the pinnacle, and then\nyou left and became chancellor of a university."},"438":{"dur":5,"text":"What made you want to leave the private sector,\nand take a leadership role at a university?"},"443":{"dur":7,"text":"Sue: Well, I had been president at Genentech\nfor about five years, and in 2009, our majority"},"451":{"dur":4,"text":"shareholder, Hoffmann-La Roche, bought the\nremainder of Genentech."},"455":{"dur":7,"text":"And so the company was the focus of what people\ncall in the business world the squeeze-out."},"463":{"dur":7,"text":"And when Roche bought the company, it would\nhave meant going from an 11,000-person biotech"},"470":{"dur":6,"text":"company in south San Francisco, to being part\nof a 90,000-person international drug company."},"476":{"dur":4,"text":"That wasn't as compelling to me as what I\nhad been doing, and so the University of California,"},"481":{"dur":5,"text":"San Francisco, which is where I had done my\nmedical training and fellowship, had asked"},"487":{"dur":3,"text":"me to look at the job as chancellor."},"491":{"dur":7,"text":"And given that transition time for myself\nof going from Genentech to the Roche acquisition,"},"498":{"dur":3,"text":"I interviewed for the job, not thinking that\nthey would select someone from the private"},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"sector which was unusual."},"505":{"dur":6,"text":"And so in 2009, I became their first female\nchancellor which was a first."},"512":{"dur":5,"text":"But I think a bigger first was the first private\nsector chancellor because I'd been 16 years"},"517":{"dur":6,"text":"in the private sector, but had an adjunct\nappointment and still taught at UCSF, at Stanford,"},"524":{"dur":1,"text":"and at UC Berkeley."},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"I actually taught about portfolio management\nin the business school."},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"Michael: Oh, is that right?"},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"Sue: Which was kind of funny to do that."},"532":{"dur":4,"text":"But I enjoy teaching, and I enjoyed scholarship."},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"So it wasn't too crazy."},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"But it was definitely unusual."},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"Michael: So it is very unusual."},"543":{"dur":5,"text":"And do you think having a private sector background\nhelped you to succeed as a university chancellor?"},"549":{"dur":3,"text":"Sue: I think the private sector background\nwas helpful."},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think I had a lot to learn."},"555":{"dur":5,"text":"I'll give you one example that people who\nknow academia would chuckle about."},"560":{"dur":4,"text":"The concept of shared governance, when I first\nheard that..."},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"Michael: We have a lot of fun with that here\ntoo."},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"Sue: Yeah."},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"When I first heard about shared governance\nas being the faculty and the chancellor, I"},"570":{"dur":1,"text":"said, \"Are you kidding me?\""},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"Like that makes no sense."},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"Sharing is hard, you know."},"578":{"dur":4,"text":"And so I learned a lot as chancellor, about\nthat."},"582":{"dur":4,"text":"On the other hand, we had a major academic\nmedical center."},"586":{"dur":6,"text":"UCSF Medical Center is a big, big medical\ncenter, and it's a big business."},"593":{"dur":6,"text":"And so I definitely brought during that really\ntough time, the big recession, a lot of business"},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"savvy to the university which I think was\nvery helpful."},"603":{"dur":5,"text":"And I learned a lot about shared governance,\nabout student life, about really thinking"},"608":{"dur":8,"text":"about things that I was either not very knowledgeable\nabout, or had to catch up on, like what it's"},"616":{"dur":6,"text":"like to work off of NIH grants, how to run\na lab in a world where the researchers feel"},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"small and the expenses seem big, and some..."},"626":{"dur":1,"text":"Michael: Yeah."},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"And are growing."},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"Sue: And are growing."},"629":{"dur":5,"text":"So I learned a lot more than I had remembered\nabout academic life and what it's really like"},"634":{"dur":3,"text":"to be a faculty member in these times."},"637":{"dur":1,"text":"Michael: Yeah."},"638":{"dur":5,"text":"It's not a...gathering a group of 22-year-olds\nat your feet and talking about Aristotle anymore."},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"Sue: No."},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"It's definitely not that."},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"And student life has changed a lot."},"648":{"dur":6,"text":"Student life has changed, and students' aspirations\nand their expectations are different than"},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"mine were when I went to medical school, now\na long time ago."},"657":{"dur":1,"text":"Michael: In what way?"},"658":{"dur":6,"text":"Sue: I would say that students' expectations\nfor how they have a well-rounded life or how"},"665":{"dur":6,"text":"they have a life outside of medicine in a\npositive way is different than what I expected."},"671":{"dur":5,"text":"I expected that I would be immersed in medical\nschool and in my internship and residency."},"676":{"dur":4,"text":"In fact, now there's laws that govern the\nhours of residents."},"681":{"dur":1,"text":"Those laws didn't exist when I was in training."},"683":{"dur":1,"text":"Michael: Do you think those are good laws?"},"685":{"dur":3,"text":"Sue: I think that those laws are generally\ngood."},"689":{"dur":5,"text":"I think it's really important for the health\nand safety of the patients you're caring for"},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"and for the residents themselves."},"695":{"dur":3,"text":"There are some down sides to the laws."},"699":{"dur":4,"text":"You have to do a lot of hand offs when you\nhave duty hours laws, and the hand offs aren't"},"704":{"dur":3,"text":"good for patients, and aren't actually good\nfor learning."},"707":{"dur":9,"text":"And so now there's a very healthy inquiry\nabout how do you protect those trainees and"},"716":{"dur":4,"text":"the patients they care for while giving the\npatients that continuity that they got when"},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"I was in the hospital for 36 hours straight."},"724":{"dur":4,"text":"So trying to make sure you get continuity\nand great training at the same time as you"},"728":{"dur":4,"text":"don't do things that...I mean, if you just\nsay out loud 36 hours straight at a job, you"},"733":{"dur":1,"text":"know that makes no sense, right?"},"734":{"dur":4,"text":"Michael: The thought of being treated by somebody\non their 35th consecutive hour always gave"},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"you the willies a little bit."},"740":{"dur":1,"text":"Sue: Yeah."},"741":{"dur":6,"text":"No, I think those are things that you have\nto balance in how you learn with supervision,"},"747":{"dur":1,"text":"so that..."},"748":{"dur":4,"text":"I always used to say that one of the things\nthat I learned in medical training is the"},"753":{"dur":3,"text":"difference between the hairs being up on the\nback of your neck, and the hairs being up"},"756":{"dur":1,"text":"on the back of my neck."},"758":{"dur":4,"text":"Like that sense that I'm on the spot and this\npatient's dependent on me, you need that in"},"763":{"dur":3,"text":"your training, but you don't wanna put that\npatient at risk."},"767":{"dur":5,"text":"Those are some of the nuances of medical training\nthat are really tough."},"772":{"dur":6,"text":"But the great news is, and I'd learned this\nas chancellor, there are experts in clinical"},"779":{"dur":6,"text":"education, be it medical, nursing, pharmacy,\ndentistry, which is the areas that are clinically"},"785":{"dur":1,"text":"trained at UCSF."},"787":{"dur":3,"text":"There's actually a lot of scholarship on that\nnow."},"790":{"dur":5,"text":"Best ways of learning, best ways of experiencing,\nso you can maximize technical proficiency"},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"and empathy."},"796":{"dur":1,"text":"So we all want..."},"797":{"dur":1,"text":"Michael: Yeah."},"798":{"dur":1,"text":"You gotta balance."},"799":{"dur":1,"text":"Sue: We want a good doctor who has a good\nbedside manner as well."},"801":{"dur":1,"text":"Michael: That's right."},"802":{"dur":5,"text":"One of your many contributions as a public\nintellectual is this concept of precision"},"808":{"dur":1,"text":"public health."},"810":{"dur":1,"text":"What is that, and why is it important?"},"812":{"dur":5,"text":"Sue: So precision public health for me is\nimportant because it takes the incredibly"},"818":{"dur":5,"text":"powerful concept of precision medicine: right\ndrug, right patient, right time, and applies"},"823":{"dur":3,"text":"it to public health and global health."},"827":{"dur":6,"text":"So you think about the right set of interventions\nfor the right population, in the right geography."},"834":{"dur":4,"text":"If you're a minister of health in Ethiopia,\nyou've got frontline healthcare workers who"},"838":{"dur":7,"text":"might have a 10th-grade education, who might\nhave limitations in budget."},"846":{"dur":6,"text":"And you've gotta pick 10 things that she has\nin her bag that she goes out and carries to"},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"somebody in her village."},"854":{"dur":3,"text":"What should be in that set of 10 interventions?"},"858":{"dur":1,"text":"What belongs there?"},"859":{"dur":1,"text":"What should she be trained to do?"},"861":{"dur":1,"text":"That's a tall order."},"863":{"dur":1,"text":"That is a tall order."},"865":{"dur":8,"text":"So precision public health, for me, is the\nconcept of using data and monitoring and feedback"},"873":{"dur":4,"text":"to give those caregivers and the decision-makers\nin the Ministry of Health, no matter where"},"878":{"dur":4,"text":"you are in the world, or the Department of\nPublic Health, if you're here in Washington,"},"882":{"dur":6,"text":"D.C., the right information to maximize the\nvalue of every penny spent on health in service"},"888":{"dur":1,"text":"of that community."},"890":{"dur":10,"text":"It really is a transition from a highly individualistic\nprecise way of thinking to a more prevention-oriented,"},"900":{"dur":6,"text":"more community-oriented way of thinking about\nbeing productive with the resources including"},"907":{"dur":3,"text":"the human resources you have to keep a community\nhealthy."},"910":{"dur":4,"text":"Michael: Do you have an example of where that's\nbeing done particularly well?"},"915":{"dur":5,"text":"Sue: Well, actually I think we all are seeing\nan example of how that can be done well with"},"920":{"dur":1,"text":"the Zika virus epidemic."},"922":{"dur":6,"text":"If you look at how we know where Anopheles\nmosquitoes are, that's the malaria mosquito,"},"928":{"dur":1,"text":"we've used that for malaria control."},"930":{"dur":6,"text":"The Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is the source\nof Zika and dengue fever and chikungunya,"},"937":{"dur":4,"text":"some of the things people have been reading\nabout, we know where the Aedes aegypti mosquito"},"942":{"dur":5,"text":"is, we know where Zika has traveled, we know\ncommunity by community."},"947":{"dur":3,"text":"Yesterday we knew that there was a case of\nZika in Texas."},"950":{"dur":1,"text":"That's precision public health."},"952":{"dur":6,"text":"Knowing precisely what community, where the\npatient was, what the transmission route was."},"959":{"dur":6,"text":"And that allows caregivers and decision makers\nnot to just say, \"Okay, everybody in America"},"965":{"dur":1,"text":"should be worried about Zika.\""},"967":{"dur":3,"text":"That makes no sense, and it's cost-prohibitive."},"970":{"dur":5,"text":"But if you know the very communities, you\ncan target vector control, getting rid of"},"975":{"dur":6,"text":"the mosquitoes, you can target messages for\nwomen who are pregnant or who might become"},"982":{"dur":5,"text":"pregnant, you can target messages for males\nwho can transmit Zika to their partners."},"987":{"dur":5,"text":"And both the public health messages on the\ncommunication front and the interventions"},"992":{"dur":5,"text":"on vectors and virus can be much more precisely\ndelivered."},"997":{"dur":4,"text":"That's a good example of where, with the right\nresources and the right data, we can make"},"1001":{"dur":1,"text":"a huge difference."},"1002":{"dur":6,"text":"Michael: So would it be fair to summarize\nthis as getting the right information out,"},"1009":{"dur":2,"text":"and acting on it appropriately?"},"1011":{"dur":1,"text":"Sue: Absolutely."},"1012":{"dur":1,"text":"And it starts with getting the right information."},"1014":{"dur":4,"text":"It's amazing how often we're nearly flying\nblind."},"1018":{"dur":6,"text":"And one of the aspects that we've been investing\nin at the foundation, is the causes of neo-natal"},"1025":{"dur":1,"text":"mortality."},"1026":{"dur":5,"text":"So there's a period of life, actually, your\nmost scary day is your birthday."},"1031":{"dur":1,"text":"The first day of life."},"1032":{"dur":1,"text":"Michael: Is that right?"},"1033":{"dur":3,"text":"Sue: Under-five mortality is the highest in\nthe first day of life."},"1036":{"dur":4,"text":"And in too many of those cases, we don't actually\nknow why those children are dying."},"1041":{"dur":6,"text":"If we had that knowledge, if we had the information,\nmuch better information on all causes of death"},"1047":{"dur":5,"text":"in the first 30 days, only then can we more\nprecisely give a remedy."},"1052":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll give you a really easy example."},"1055":{"dur":6,"text":"So Group B Strep is a bacterial infection\nthat causes fatalities very early in life."},"1061":{"dur":6,"text":"If a woman's baby dies of Group B Strep, she\nhas seven times the chance that her next baby"},"1067":{"dur":3,"text":"will also die of Group B Strep, this bacterial\ninfection."},"1071":{"dur":5,"text":"And it can be prevented with penicillin, pennies\na dose, right?"},"1077":{"dur":7,"text":"So that's a good example of where that data,\nthat information getting back to those communities"},"1084":{"dur":5,"text":"if you're seeing Group B Strep as a cause\nof mortality, that community needs penicillin"},"1089":{"dur":1,"text":"for those women."},"1090":{"dur":2,"text":"So a really simple remedy."},"1093":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not talking rocket science."},"1094":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm talking penicillin for heaven's sakes."},"1096":{"dur":3,"text":"You would only do that if you were able to\ndiagnose the Group B Strep."},"1100":{"dur":1,"text":"Michael: Yeah, yeah."},"1101":{"dur":1,"text":"That makes sense."},"1103":{"dur":2,"text":"You mentioned Zika."},"1105":{"dur":2,"text":"Are you worried about pandemics in general?"},"1107":{"dur":4,"text":"Do you think that the world is ready for a\nfull-scale pandemic?"},"1112":{"dur":3,"text":"Sue: I'm very worried about pandemics."},"1115":{"dur":6,"text":"Since I've been at the foundation, we've actually...the\nworld has seen both Ebola and Zika, and the"},"1122":{"dur":6,"text":"foundation didn't intend to invest or specialize\nin pandemics, but we've gotten very involved"},"1129":{"dur":5,"text":"because it's clear to us and the global health\ncommunity that the world isn't ready for the"},"1134":{"dur":4,"text":"biggest threat of all which almost surely\nis influenza."},"1139":{"dur":8,"text":"We have been lucky as a globe that Ebola is\nactually not as contagious as influenza."},"1147":{"dur":5,"text":"That Zika, while horrible for the families\ninvolved because it causes a terrible birth"},"1153":{"dur":6,"text":"defect, is very limited, and in most people,\ndoesn't cause a difficult disease."},"1159":{"dur":2,"text":"It's much more like a flu."},"1161":{"dur":5,"text":"If the world saw pandemic flu, we are not\nready."},"1167":{"dur":6,"text":"And so our foundation with the global community\nhas gotten involved in governance issues,"},"1174":{"dur":3,"text":"surveillance issues, and in getting better\ntools."},"1177":{"dur":6,"text":"We need better tools, be they diagnostics,\ntherapeutics, vaccines."},"1184":{"dur":5,"text":"The world needs to have things in our tool\nkit so that we can respond more rapidly."},"1189":{"dur":6,"text":"What we found with Ebola, in particular, is\nthat the vaccinations were ready when the"},"1196":{"dur":1,"text":"epidemic was finished."},"1197":{"dur":1,"text":"Michael: Yeah."},"1199":{"dur":1,"text":"That sounds worrying."},"1200":{"dur":7,"text":"So if this flu season turned out to be a really\nbad one, do you think we'd be able to step"},"1208":{"dur":2,"text":"in and take the kind of measures that we needed\nto?"},"1211":{"dur":4,"text":"Sue: So the seasonal flu, we're on it."},"1216":{"dur":5,"text":"Seasonal flu,
