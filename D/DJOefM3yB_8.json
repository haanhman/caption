the"},"104":{"dur":7,"text":"entrance and exits to the tunnel network just\nby using two parking spaces."},"111":{"dur":1,"text":"And then the car gets on a skate."},"113":{"dur":5,"text":"There's no

beyond"},"235":{"dur":1,"text":"that."},"236":{"dur":5,"text":"So the first thing to do is to cut the tunnel\ndiameter by a factor of two or more."},"241":{"dur":5,"text":"So a single road lane tunnel

stop, and then the"},"282":{"dur":4,"text":"rest of the time is putting in reinforcements\nfor the tunnel wall."},"286":{"dur":4,"text":"So if you design the machine instead to do\ncontinuous tunneling and reinforcing, that"},"290":{"dur":2,"text":"will give you a factor of two improvement."},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"Combine that and that's a factor of eight."},"295":{"dur":4,"text":"Also
