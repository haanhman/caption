what we think\nis the most meaningful gift"},"74":{"dur":1,"text":"in the world."},"75":{"dur":1,"text":"We're going to talk about stats."},"77":{"dur":2,"text":"How do strong social ties and\nrelationships affect our brains"},"80":{"dur":1,"text":"and affect our bodies?"},"81":{"dur":2,"text":"And we're going to talk\nabout tangible takeaways."},"84":{"dur":2,"text":"So how we can actually\ncommunicate to connect."},"87":{"dur":1,"text":"So those are those\nthree components."},"88":{"dur":3,"text":"And before we start, it's always\nnice to actually establish,"},"92":{"dur":2,"text":"what is human connection?"},"94":{"dur":3,"text":"And my favorite definition\nis this one by Brene Brown."},"97":{"dur":4,"text":"\"I define connection as energy\nthat exists between people when"},"102":{"dur":2,"text":"they feel seen, and\nheard, and valued;"},"104":{"dur":2,"text":"and when they can give and\nreceive without judgment;"},"107":{"dur":2,"text":"and when they derive\nstrength and sustenance"},"110":{"dur":2,"text":"from the relationship.\""},"113":{"dur":1,"text":"A beautiful articulation\nof that energy"},"115":{"dur":3,"text":"that exists between two\npeople when we feel connected."},"118":{"dur":3,"text":"And at Tribute, we've actually\nbroken that down even further."},"122":{"dur":1,"text":"So we've created\na construct that"},"123":{"dur":3,"text":"can allow people to evaluate the\ndepth of their relationships,"},"127":{"dur":2,"text":"that which they have an\nabundance of, that which"},"129":{"dur":1,"text":"they're really seeking."},"131":{"dur":1,"text":"And we call that AVS."},"132":{"dur":5,"text":"So AVS is a mutual feeling\nof A, appreciation,"},"138":{"dur":3,"text":"mutual recognition\nof the other person."},"141":{"dur":1,"text":"Do you see that person?"},"142":{"dur":2,"text":"Do you appreciate who they are?"},"144":{"dur":2,"text":"Needs to exist for\nhuman connection."},"147":{"dur":4,"text":"Second, vulnerability."},"151":{"dur":2,"text":"Can I be honest\nwith this person?"},"153":{"dur":2,"text":"Can I be truthful\nwith this person?"},"156":{"dur":3,"text":"Can I be fully myself\nwith this person?"},"160":{"dur":4,"text":"Vulnerability is the\nbridge to connection."},"164":{"dur":2,"text":"Next is support, and\nsupport's a beautiful thing."},"167":{"dur":2,"text":"And the way you think about\nit in human connection"},"169":{"dur":4,"text":"is a natural call to\nsupport and be supported."},"173":{"dur":1,"text":"And so these are\nthe three components"},"175":{"dur":4,"text":"that we can break down when\nhuman connection truly exists."},"179":{"dur":2,"text":"An easy way to evaluate\nyour friendships, as well as"},"182":{"dur":3,"text":"those new relationships\nthat you're adding depth to."},"185":{"dur":1,"text":"That's our definition\nof human connection."},"187":{"dur":1,"text":"So we all know that\nhuman connection"},"188":{"dur":3,"text":"is important to experience,\nto have fun, to magnify joy."},"192":{"dur":2,"text":"But I also want to introduce\nyou to why we should really"},"195":{"dur":2,"text":"care about our social\nties, our relationships."},"197":{"dur":2,"text":"And to do that, I'm going\nto introduce you to a guy"},"199":{"dur":2,"text":"named Dr. Robert Waldinger."},"201":{"dur":3,"text":"So Dr. Waldinger did the\nlongest study on happiness"},"204":{"dur":1,"text":"in our history."},"206":{"dur":5,"text":"It's a 75-year longitudinal\nstudy of 750 people."},"211":{"dur":2,"text":"When they released his research,\nhe gave this famous TED Talk."},"214":{"dur":1,"text":"And also, as I was perusing\nthrough the results"},"216":{"dur":2,"text":"of that research,\nthere was one statement"},"218":{"dur":1,"text":"that they literally\nhighlighted and bolded"},"220":{"dur":1,"text":"to emphasize its importance."},"222":{"dur":2,"text":"And that statement was this."},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"\"The clearest message\nwe got from this study"},"226":{"dur":3,"text":"is that good relationships\nkeep us happier and healthier."},"230":{"dur":1,"text":"Period."},"232":{"dur":3,"text":"Good relationships keep\nus happier and healthier."},"235":{"dur":2,"text":"Period.\""},"237":{"dur":2,"text":"So from this research,\nwe can assume"},"239":{"dur":2,"text":"that strong social ties,\ninvesting in our relationships,"},"242":{"dur":1,"text":"is probably the smartest\ninvestment we can"},"244":{"dur":1,"text":"make in our overall happiness."},"245":{"dur":2,"text":"But it goes beyond\njust happiness."},"247":{"dur":0,"text":"What about our health?"},"248":{"dur":0,"text":"What about our brains?"},"249":{"dur":2,"text":"What about our bodies?"},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"So recent research\nalso shows, people"},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"who have strong social\nties, the medical term"},"256":{"dur":4,"text":"to connotate relationships,\nhave longer lives, stronger"},"260":{"dur":3,"text":"immune systems, literally higher\nlevels of white blood cells"},"263":{"dur":3,"text":"to fight off disease, lower\nlevels of stress and

said this."},"276":{"dur":4,"text":"Having weak social ties is\nas harmful to ongoing health"},"280":{"dur":5,"text":"as being an alcoholic and\ntwice as harmful as obesity.\""},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"So again, when we\nhave weak social ties,"},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"it's not just a detriment\nto our happiness."},"291":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a detriment to our health\nand our mental well-being."},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's something that\nwe need to care about."},"298":{"dur":2,"text":"And so now I want to tell you\nguys a little bit about how"},"300":{"dur":1,"text":"I got into this\nline of work, how"},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"I was able to study\nhuman connection,"},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"start businesses that are\nbolstering relationships"},"306":{"dur":1,"text":"and gratitude in the\nworld, and started"},"308":{"dur":1,"text":"when I was 10 years old."},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"The first job I can remember\nis selling these books"},"312":{"dur":1,"text":"in a back of a room for my mom."},"314":{"dur":1,"text":"My mom's an eight-time\npublished author."},"315":{"dur":3,"text":"She talks about communication,\nnetworking, articulating"},"318":{"dur":1,"text":"the value of your ideas."},"320":{"dur":1,"text":"So this thread of\ncommunicating to connect"},"322":{"dur":3,"text":"was something that was ingrained\nin me at a very young age."},"326":{"dur":3,"text":"And so one of the common\nthreads through my childhood"},"329":{"dur":1,"text":"was sports."},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"It was how I connected,\nplaying basketball, football,"},"333":{"dur":1,"text":"and lacrosse."},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"Right before I graduated,\nI was enlightened"},"337":{"dur":2,"text":"to the power of\nadaptive athletics,"},"339":{"dur":2,"text":"helping young people\nwith disabilities"},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"to unite with their\npeers through sports."},"344":{"dur":1,"text":"And that inspired\nme to start dreams"},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"for Kids DC, a community\nthat brought kids together"},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"to play all these incredible\nthings you see up here."},"350":{"dur":3,"text":"Water skiing, outdoor\nadventures, hockey, lacrosse."},"353":{"dur":3,"text":"Using sport as a facilitator\nof human connection."},"357":{"dur":1,"text":"Then I got really\ninterested in tech,"},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"and I started to look at\nbigger problems affecting"},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"the people with disabilities\nin their community."},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we built Ability\nList, an online platform"},"366":{"dur":1,"text":"that allows people\nwith disabilities"},"368":{"dur":4,"text":"to share the resources they\nknow about and that they need."},"372":{"dur":4,"text":"So again, building community\nwith an online platform."},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"So this passion for\nconnection, this curiosity"},"380":{"dur":3,"text":"about communication took a\nstep up to the next level"},"383":{"dur":5,"text":"when I was 27 years old, and\nit all started with a gift."},"388":{"dur":3,"text":"So my fiance Miki is in the\nback of the room right now,"},"391":{"dur":1,"text":"and on my 27th birthday,\nshe took me out"},"393":{"dur":1,"text":"to dinner in Brooklyn\nwhere we live."},"395":{"dur":1,"text":"We come back to our\napartment, and I'll always"},"397":{"dur":1,"text":"remember that I swing the\ndoor open, thinking that we're"},"399":{"dur":1,"text":"going to have a low-key night."},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"Then there's a silence."},"403":{"dur":5,"text":"And then three, two, one,\nall these people jump out."},"408":{"dur":1,"text":"She had planned

party,\nMiki jumps up on a chair"},"417":{"dur":3,"text":"and she yells, (YELLING)\neveryone in the living room!"},"420":{"dur":1,"text":"So everyone runs\ninto the living room."},"422":{"dur":1,"text":"She sits me right in\nthe back, and she had"},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"rented this projection screen."},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"So she puts it up on the wall."},"428":{"dur":4,"text":"I have no idea what's going\non, and I would soon find out."},"432":{"dur":1,"text":"So Miki had taken\nthe time to reach out"},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"to 25 of my closest friends\nand all my family members."},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"She asked each one of them\nto submit a one-minute video"},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"telling me why they love me."},"443":{"dur":3,"text":"Even telling you this, I get\ngoosebumps over my entire body."},"446":{"dur":1,"text":"So as I sat there in\nthe back of the room,"},"448":{"dur":1,"text":"these videos started to stream."},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"My best friend in New York\ncalling me his best friend"},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"for the first time ever."},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"My brother telling\nme how grateful"},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"he is that we're\nfinally friends again."},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"My mom telling me how\nproud of me she is."},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"And that was about\nthe moment that--"},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"what Alan Watts would call tears\nof wonder joy started to flow."},"466":{"dur":4,"text":"Not even a cute little cry, but\nlike a big, ugly, like, massive"},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"drops coming down."},"471":{"dur":1,"text":"One of those cries."},"473":{"dur":3,"text":"And I did that for the\nnext 20 minutes straight."},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"So I remember when it\nstopped, the first thought"},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"I had in my head was, wow."},"480":{"dur":4,"text":"I just watched my\neulogy at 27, which"},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"is a much better time to watch\nyour eulogy, in my opinion."},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"So I needed a break, and I\nwalked over to the next room,"},"491":{"dur":1,"text":"and I just looked\nat Miki, and I said,"},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"that was the best gift\nI've ever received."},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"And I said, how did you do it?"},"496":{"dur":1,"text":"And she just looks back\nat me and she says,"},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"well, it was terrible."},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"And so she says\nagain, it was hundreds"},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"of emails to remind people\nto submit their videos,"},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"collecting files through\nDropbox, drive, text message."},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"And last but not least, editing\neverything together in iMovie."},"513":{"dur":1,"text":"So it took her about 15 hours."},"515":{"dur":2,"text":"It was then and there, I had\nthis innate understanding"},"518":{"dur":1,"text":"of the power of this gift."},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"And I realized the\nonly reason more people"},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"didn't get it was because of\nhow difficult it was to create."},"524":{"dur":3,"text":"So then and there,\nTribute was born."},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"And so Tribute is\nour website that"},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"automates the\nprocess of building"},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"one of these gratitude-filled\nvideo montages."},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"It automates the process\nof inviting your friends,"},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"of collecting videos."},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"And we built the first web-based\ncollaborative video editor"},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"to easily put these\nthings together."},"542":{"dur":1,"text":"And it started as\na simple mission"},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"to share that joy, those\ntears of wonder joy"},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"that I felt in the back of\nthe room with the world."},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"And the last two years\nhave been really fun."},"551":{"dur":3,"text":"So over 50,000 tributes in 40\ncountries around the world."},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"Yep, that's Regis, checking\nus out on \"The Today

to our users'"},"579":{"dur":3,"text":"offline relationships?"},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"And we think that this\nis not only something"},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"that we are personally\npassionate about, but something"},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"that is incredibly\nrelevant right now."},"590":{"dur":3,"text":"Because as a society,\nwe are more connected"},"593":{"dur":1,"text":"than we have ever\nbeen,

little nervous\nfor the younger generations,"},"2040":{"dur":2,"text":"just because this\nstyle of communication"},"2042":{"dur":1,"text":"now is all they know."},"2043":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think for a lot of\nus in this room kind of"},"2046":{"dur":1,"text":"got the best of both worlds."},"2048":{"dur":4,"text":"So we have the ability to tap\ninto a lot of what you said."},"2052":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm just curious if you've\nthought at all about how"},"2054":{"dur":2,"text":"to reach a younger\naudience, or how"},"2056":{"dur":1,"text":"to kind of tackle those things."},"2057":{"dur":2,"text":"Because I found it really\nhard for the girls to,"},"2060":{"dur":4,"text":"A, be vulnerable, and that\nwhole, like, self-doubt thing."},"2064":{"dur":1,"text":"They had no confidence\nin themselves."},"2066":{"dur":2,"text":"So I was just\ncurious, like your--"},"2068":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't know-- ideas on\ntargeting a younger audience."},"2070":{"dur":2,"text":"ANDREW HORN: Yeah, you know, so\nTribute's target demographics"},"2073":{"dur":2,"text":"and where we focus on\nis on the 18 and above."},"2076":{"dur":2,"text":"So where people kind of\nhave a little more emotional"},"2078":{"dur":2,"text":"intelligence and are capable\nof articulating these things."},"2081":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's not where I've spent\nmost of my time at Tribute,"},"2083":{"dur":2,"text":"but it was where I spent a great\ndeal of my time with Dreams"},"2086":{"dur":1,"text":"For Kids."},"2088":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think that\nwhat we always lead"},"2089":{"dur":2,"text":"with when it comes to kids,\nagain, are some of these values"},"2092":{"dur":2,"text":"that we talked about of leading\nwith kindness before we get"},"2095":{"dur":1,"text":"to the communication aspect."},"2096":{"dur":2,"text":"It's establishing that as\nthe foundation of interaction"},"2099":{"dur":2,"text":"between people of just\nbeing able to ask yourself,"},"2102":{"dur":1,"text":"is this a kind thing?"},"2103":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I mean, when we\nwere at Dreams For Kids, we"},"2106":{"dur":3,"text":"had this thing that we embraced\nat any one of our events,"},"2110":{"dur":3,"text":"because we were dealing with a\nlot of kids with disabilities,"},"2113":{"dur":5,"text":"is if you're ever unsure,\nthe general consensus"},"2118":{"dur":2,"text":"was that you just\ngo over and you ask."},"2120":{"dur":2,"text":"And everyone just\nseeks to understand."},"2122":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was basically\nsetting this baseline"},"2124":{"dur":3,"text":"of understanding between people\nrather than making judgments,"},"2128":{"dur":1,"text":"and all these other things."},"2129":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think, again, you know,\nI don't do a lot of work"},"2131":{"dur":0,"text":"directly with kids."},"2132":{"dur":2,"text":"But I think that establishing\nthat understanding"},"2135":{"dur":2,"text":"of seeking to understand\nyour counterpart"},"2137":{"dur":3,"text":"and asking questions will still\nbe a virtuous path, right?"},"2141":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, when you think about\nyour time as a counselor,"},"2143":{"dur":2,"text":"what were the biggest\nchallenges that young girls were"},"2145":{"dur":1,"text":"finding with being vulnerable?"},"2147":{"dur":1,"text":"Just that they were\nbeing attacked,"},"2148":{"dur":1,"text":"or they weren't receiving\nthat back to them, or--"},"2150":{"dur":1,"text":"A little bit of everything."},"2151":{"dur":2,"text":"I think part of it was\ntoo, like, they couldn't"},"2153":{"dur":3,"text":"find an authentic voice,\nbecause everything"},"2156":{"dur":4,"text":"was done for a like on\nInstagram or for a retweet,"},"2161":{"dur":1,"text":"or whatever it was."},"2162":{"dur":2,"text":"And they would give each\nother compliments on Instagram"},"2165":{"dur":2,"text":"just to get it back so\nthat they could look at it"},"2167":{"dur":3,"text":"and say, I have 500 comments\nof how great I look, you know?"},"2170":{"dur":1,"text":"ANDREW HORN: So I'm so\nhappy you said that,"},"2172":{"dur":2,"text":"because it really did just\ntrigger something in me."},"2174":{"dur":3,"text":"And you know, my reality is\nthat I wasn't a great student"},"2177":{"dur":1,"text":"throughout high school\nand even college."},"2179":{"dur":2,"text":"It's kind of like, I went\nthrough and I got grades,"},"2181":{"dur":3,"text":"but I was never fully\npresent there or valued it."},"2185":{"dur":2,"text":"And no kind of\nguidance, no speakers,"},"2188":{"dur":2,"text":"no counselors ever\nconnected with me"},"2190":{"dur":3,"text":"and gave me insight or advice\nabout how to evaluate the world"},"2193":{"dur":2,"text":"or how I wanted to live my\nlife that really connected."},"2196":{"dur":1,"text":"And so when we\ntalk about starting"},"2198":{"dur":2,"text":"with the art of meaningful\nconversation and questions,"},"2200":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that, again, is\nthe best place to start."},"2203":{"dur":2,"text":"Because if you\nempower young people"},"2205":{"dur":3,"text":"at a young age with a\nfoundational sense of self--"},"2208":{"dur":1,"text":"who they are, what's\nimportant to them--"},"2210":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that that's the\nmost important thing."},"2212":{"dur":3,"text":"And again, you can give\nthat to a younger person"},"2215":{"dur":2,"text":"and say, here are\nsome of the questions"},"2217":{"dur":1,"text":"that you can explore\nfor yourself."},"2218":{"dur":1,"text":"And when you can relay\nthat directly back"},"2220":{"dur":2,"text":"to social anxiety and shyness\nand some of those things"},"2223":{"dur":2,"text":"that are much more prevalent\nin high school and college,"},"2226":{"dur":2,"text":"then what happens is that\nyou give people a foundation"},"2228":{"dur":3,"text":"to say, before you can feel\nconfident in these situations,"},"2232":{"dur":2,"text":"like, the most important\nthing is truly understanding,"},"2235":{"dur":1,"text":"trusting, and loving yourself."},"2237":{"dur":1,"text":"And so we can give\nthat to young people."},"2238":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that that's always\nwhere I would start,"},"2240":{"dur":1,"text":"is not telling one\nto do anything,"},"2242":{"dur":2,"text":"but providing them with the\nconstruct to actually perform"},"2244":{"dur":2,"text":"that kind of\nintrospection that leads"},"2247":{"dur":1,"text":"to virtuous\ninteractions, connection,"},"2248":{"dur":2,"text":"connecting with the type\nof people that we need to."},"2251":{"dur":1,"text":"It's like almost\ntrying to get it"},"2252":{"dur":2,"text":"proactive rather than reactive,\nbecause that was like--"},"2254":{"dur":2,"text":"we were trying to put out\nfires almost, you know?"},"2257":{"dur":1,"text":"And it was hard to\ndo at that point."},"2259":{"dur":1,"text":"ANDREW HORN: Yeah,\nmy mom always says"},"2260":{"dur":5,"text":"that the wisest

absolutely."},"2276":{"dur":1,"text":"AUDIENCE: This is a really\nwelcome interruption"},"2278":{"dur":0,"text":"[LAUGH]"},"2279":{"dur":1,"text":"I imagine the\npeople in this

you"},"2295":{"dur":1,"text":"navigate this when you're\nmeeting somebody who"},"2297":{"dur":2,"text":"is unwilling to meet\nyou at that level,"},"2300":{"dur":2,"text":"and who is uncomfortable

you\nspeaking in a business context"},"2310":{"dur":0,"text":"or social?"},"2311":{"dur":1,"text":"AUDIENCE: I think\nit applies to both."},"2312":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'd be curious--"},"2313":{"dur":1,"text":"ANDREW HORN: Yeah, absolutely."},"2315":{"dur":1,"text":"So let's start with social."},"2316":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is something\nthat I've had"},"2318":{"dur":2,"text":"to come to grips with\nas well, is again,"},"2320":{"dur":2,"text":"dealing with my own\nanxieties and shyness"},"2322":{"dur":1,"text":"with social\ninteraction, and how I"},"2324":{"dur":1,"text":"wanted to show up in the world."},"2326":{"dur":2,"text":"One thing that I've become\nvery clear on later in life"},"2328":{"dur":3,"text":"is that it is not\nour responsibility"},"2331":{"dur":2,"text":"to make people feel comfortable."},"2334":{"dur":3,"text":"It is our responsibility\nto be honest to ourselves."},"2337":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is within the\nconstruct of, again,"},"2339":{"dur":2,"text":"leading with kindness, is\nthat we cannot harm people,"},"2342":{"dur":1,"text":"so we need to lead\nwith kindness."},"2343":{"dur":2,"text":"But that ultimately, it\nis not our responsibility"},"2346":{"dur":1,"text":"to make people comfortable."},"2347":{"dur":3,"text":"It is our responsibility to\nbe honest with ourselves."},"2350":{"dur":2,"text":"And if we're accepting of\nsome of these principles"},"2352":{"dur":3,"text":"about asking questions\nand knowing who we are"},"2356":{"dur":4,"text":"and being fully present,\nI think that sometimes you"},"2360":{"dur":2,"text":"are going to\ninteract with people"},"2362":{"dur":2,"text":"who don't connect with you,\nwho are not on your frequency."},"2365":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think that knowing that\nyou've showed up in integrity"},"2368":{"dur":3,"text":"in those moments as yourself\nallows you to not get"},"2372":{"dur":2,"text":"hung up on them, allows\nyou to move forward."},"2375":{"dur":2,"text":"And the reality is that\nyou only have limited time"},"2377":{"dur":2,"text":"on this Earth, and\nso those people who"},"2379":{"dur":2,"text":"aren't able to meet\nyou where you're at"},"2382":{"dur":1,"text":"are oftentimes not\nthose people that you're"},"2384":{"dur":0,"text":"going to connect with."},"2385":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, I'd say that, again,\nin the professional context,"},"2389":{"dur":3,"text":"seeking to understand people\nis this virtuous path where"},"2393":{"dur":2,"text":"if people aren't going to\nmeet you all the way at what's"},"2395":{"dur":2,"text":"your dream, and you're\nmeeting them at--"},"2398":{"dur":2,"text":"whether it's like Penn\nStation or whatever it is--"},"2400":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that there's\na way that you can"},"2402":{"dur":2,"text":"start earlier on to get there."},"2404":{"dur":2,"text":"And so again, I think that just\nbecause someone can't meet you"},"2407":{"dur":1,"text":"there, like, if you were\nto break down again--"},"2409":{"dur":2,"text":"and you talked about, when we\nwere chatting right here, like,"},"2412":{"dur":2,"text":"your perception of\npeople right off the bat."},"2414":{"dur":3,"text":"And I love the idea that\nyour first question is not"},"2418":{"dur":1,"text":"your real question."},"2419":{"dur":2,"text":"It's that for a lot\nof people, like, they"},"2422":{"dur":2,"text":"won't be able to go\nthere right off the

curiosity"},"2430":{"dur":1,"text":"and what you want to\nknow about that person."},"2432":{"dur":2,"text":"So if they're not willing\nto talk about their dreams"},"2434":{"dur":4,"text":"or what they care about, what\ndo you want to know about them,"},"2439":{"dur":2,"text":"and why they're not\nwilling to go there?"},"2441":{"dur":2,"text":"It's, again, just giving\nyourself to that process"},"2443":{"dur":1,"text":"and seeing where that\ntakes you I think"},"2444":{"dur":2,"text":"is always going to\nbe a virtuous path."},"2447":{"dur":0,"text":"Does that make

there good tricks to\ndo that I guess is my question."},"2568":{"dur":1,"text":"ANDREW HORN: Absolutely."},"2569":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, I'll expand on\nthe comparison

comparing,"},"2602":{"dur":2,"text":"my first thought there, and\nwhat I've trained myself to do"},"2604":{"dur":3,"text":"is to realize that that\ncomparison and that

insecurities."},"2632":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's that shift from\ncomparing to celebrating."},"2635":{"dur":2,"text":"And if we cannot celebrate,\nwe can acknowledge that"},"2638":{"dur":1,"text":"it's because of our\nown insecurities,"},"2639":{"dur":3,"text":"and something to be worked\non, because no one is perfect."},"2643":{"dur":2,"text":"And as it relates\nto young people,"},"2645":{"dur":2,"text":"I think, again,\nrather than telling"},"2647":{"dur":3,"text":"them what to do, the\nbest thing that we"},"2650":{"dur":2,"text":"can do with young\npeople is to ask

like."},"2678":{"dur":2,"text":"And again, we all remember\nour younger years,"},"2680":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's like, we are\nhardwired to rebel."},"2683":{"dur":1,"text":"And so when someone\nis telling us"},"2685":{"dur":1,"text":"that this is the\nway to do something,"},"2686":{"dur":2,"text":"we're going to be very\nresistant for anyone to tell us"},"2689":{"dur":3,"text":"what to do when
