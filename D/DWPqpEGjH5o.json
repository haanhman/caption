stream are high."},"285":{"dur":4,"text":"As those sugars float through the blood stream,\nthey cause changes and they deposit into the"},"290":{"dur":4,"text":"walls of the blood vessels, which leads

that?"},"333":{"dur":1,"text":"Because that does sound like a good thing."},"335":{"dur":3,"text":">> Dr. Ryan Pine:\nIt does, the new blood vessels, they're not"},"339":{"dur":5,"text":"as good as the ones you're born with, they're\nvery leaky and they tend to close off and"},"344":{"dur":6,"text":"scar and pull on the retina and cause retinal\ndetachments or large bleeds in the back

talking\nabout here?"},"355":{"dur":3,"text":">> Ryan Pine:\nIt is, and that kind of goes through the stages."},"358":{"dur":5,"text":"Early changes from diabetic retinopathy may\nbe just a few little

retinopathy."},"379":{"dur":3,"text":"Non-proliferative just means there's no growth\nof blood vessels yet, and that's subdivided"},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"into like mild, moderate, and severe."},"386":{"dur":4,"text":"With proliferative diabetic retinopathy, it's\nthe more advanced stage where new blood vessels"},"391":{"dur":5,"text":"are growing and have a very high potential\nthat can cause vision loss or blindness."},"396":{"dur":2,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nSo, are there some sort of symptoms if someone's"},"399":{"dur":4,"text":"sitting at home, like can they

the"},"417":{"dur":2,"text":"vision, maybe blurring of the central vision."},"419":{"dur":4,"text":"Sometimes, that just comes from cataracts,\nsometimes it comes from swelling or bleeding"},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"in the back of the eye."},"425":{"dur":3,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nSo, when you look at your diabetic patients"},"428":{"dur":5,"text":"who typically is at the greater

worsen."},"451":{"dur":5,"text":"Essentially, it comes down to, the longer\nyou've had diabetes, the higher your risk"},"456":{"dur":1,"text":"of having findings of it."},"457":{"dur":3,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nSo, I know that there is this connection between"},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"A1C level and retinopathy."},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"But first, talk about what A1C is."},"466":{"dur":4,"text":">> Dr. Ryan Pine:\nSure, hemoglobin A1C is a blood draw or a"},"470":{"dur":3,"text":"blood test that your primary care doctor or\nwho's managing your diabetes will check for"},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"you every three to four months."},"477":{"dur":5,"text":"That lab test looks at changes in the red\nblood cells that are caused by high sugar"},"482":{"dur":3,"text":"levels surrounding them."},"485":{"dur":6,"text":"We know that a normal hemoglobin A1C is around\n6% or less."},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"In diabetics, it's often a little bit higher."},"494":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nOkay."},"495":{"dur":1,"text":">> Dr. Ryan Pine:\nThe reason it's important, in my opinion,"},"497":{"dur":4,"text":"the reason patients, I think, should make\na goal of knowing what their A1C is and trying"},"501":{"dur":5,"text":"to keep that number low, is because that three\nmonth average of blood sugars, we have studied"},"507":{"dur":4,"text":"that in ophthalmology wondering who's at risk\nfor going blind?"},"511":{"dur":6,"text":"And what we found was patients whose hemoglobin\nA1C was less than 8%, have a significant decreased"},"518":{"dur":1,"text":"risk of going blind."},"519":{"dur":6,"text":"So, the-- it's not to say 7.9 is as good as\n6.9, but I think a target of at least less"},"525":{"dur":3,"text":"than 8%, at least early on in diabetes, is\na great goal."},"529":{"dur":3,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nSo, for someone who has diabetes, they want"},"532":{"dur":4,"text":"to be less than 8%, is that what you said,\nor what's a level?"},"536":{"dur":2,"text":">> Dr. Ryan Pine:\nIt is tailored in a little bit."},"539":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nOkay."},"540":{"dur":1,"text":">> Dr. Ryan Pine:\nIndividually and the primary care doctors"},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"and endocrinologists are very good at that."},"543":{"dur":6,"text":"But in my opinion, less than 8% is a goal\nthat everyone should have."},"549":{"dur":5,"text":"Some doctors prefer their patients closer\nto 5 and a half to 6% range, some think it's"},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"okay for them to be in the upper sixes."},"557":{"dur":2,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nSo, what do you, as the ophthalmologist, when"},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"you get those A1C results, how do you use\nthat information?"},"562":{"dur":3,"text":">> Dr. Ryan Pine:\nWell, I typically, I don't get the results"},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"sent to me, I usually ask the patient."},"567":{"dur":5,"text":"And that's always a telltale sign of how involved\nin their care they are."},"572":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nOkay."},"573":{"dur":1,"text":">> Dr. Ryan Pine:\nSome have no idea what an A1C is."},"574":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nOkay."},"575":{"dur":2,"text":">> Dr. Ryan Pine:\nSome have no idea what the number is, and"},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"others know it very well."},"579":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, I typically try to explain to them\nabout the hemoglobin A1C and that a target"},"584":{"dur":5,"text":"of less than 8% is important for the vision\nand explain why as we just discussed."},"589":{"dur":3,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nif you have someone-- let's talk about treatment,"},"593":{"dur":4,"text":"if someone does have diabetic retinopathy,\nhow do you, obviously determine the stage,"},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"then how you do you determine the course of\ntreatment for them?"},"600":{"dur":3,"text":">> Dr. Ryan Pine:\nIt can range very much accordingly to what"},"604":{"dur":1,"text":"we see in the back of the eye."},"605":{"dur":5,"text":"Very early stages, we may just observe because\nthey're reversible in early stages."},"611":{"dur":7,"text":"If the patient maybe increases their overall\nactivity and their management or their management."},"619":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nThe things that they should be doing to manage"},"621":{"dur":1,"text":"their diabetes in the first place."},"622":{"dur":2,"text":">> Dr. Ryan

swelling."},"638":{"dur":4,"text":"We can use certain lasers to the back of the\neye to help prevent those blood vessels that"},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"are bleeding to help them dry up."},"645":{"dur":6,"text":"In the more severe, advanced stages like proliferate\ndiabetic retinopathy, we use lots of lasers"},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"and combinations of injections and

hospital,\nbut most of the stuff that we're able to do,"},"669":{"dur":1,"text":"we're able to do in the exam chairs."},"670":{"dur":3,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nSo, if someone has maybe the lasers or the"},"673":{"dur":4,"text":"injections, does the-- are the results, do\nthey take a couple weeks to take affect?"},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"Or is it kind of an instant sort thing?"},"680":{"dur":1,"text":">> Dr. Ryan Pine:\nIt's definitely not instant."},"682":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nOkay."},"683":{"dur":3,"text":">> Dr. Ryan Pine:\nIt's definitely not instant,

together over those next"},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"few months; we make things a lot better."},"698":{"dur":3,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nOkay, if someone has the treatment, does that"},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"mean they can't get it again?"},"704":{"dur":5,"text":">> Dr. Ryan Pine:\nUnfortunately, no."},"710":{"dur":6,"text":"The underlying disease, if it's under

and turned over."},"1162":{"dur":3,"text":"So, there's a faucet where the fluid comes\nfrom and there's a drain where that comes"},"1165":{"dur":1,"text":"from."},"1166":{"dur":3,"text":"And sometimes, it's just an imbalance in that\nsituation that leads to an increased pressure."},"1170":{"dur":3,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nOkay, and if you had been to the eye doctor"},"1173":{"dur":5,"text":"over the years, some places still use it,\nthat puff of air."},"1178":{"dur":2,"text":"But you said there's different ways now of\ntesting

somebody shook up a snow globe."},"1307":{"dur":5,"text":"Oftentimes, that bunch of floaters is associated\nwith bright flashing lights like lightning"},"1313":{"dur":3,"text":"and then maybe in a
