there's an important\ndistinction I'm going"},"389":{"dur":1,"text":"to make throughout this chapter."},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm going to start off\nwith a 4 carbon

the CC triple\nbond is in the middle."},"405":{"dur":3,"text":"So 4 carbons, that's butane,\nbut these are both butynes,"},"410":{"dur":4,"text":"right butane has no\nunsaturation in it."},"414":{"dur":1,"text":"This clearly has an alkyne."},"416":{"dur":1,"text":"So let me right butyne here."},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"And if the highest priority\nfunctional group is an

butyne."},"432":{"dur":3,"text":"So you would count the other\ndirection and make it 3 butyne."},"436":{"dur":3,"text":"And over here it's arbitrary\nwhich side I start from."},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"No matter which side\nI start numbering"},"441":{"dur":3,"text":"from this particular\nbutyne will be 2 butyne."},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's IUPAC

exams."},"454":{"dur":1,"text":"But I might ask you a question"},"456":{"dur":3,"text":"where I say synthesize the\nfollowing internal alkyne"},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"or terminal alkyne."},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"And those are phrases I want you\nto know because I'll use them."},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"They're kind of useful phrases."},"467":{"dur":4,"text":"So how would I distinguish this\nalkyne that has a CH at the end"},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"versus an alkyne that has\nalkyl groups at the end?"},"474":{"dur":1,"text":"So this we call a\nterminal alkyne."},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"That means it's at the\nend of the molecule."},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's all kinds"},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"of distinctive chemistry\nrelated to that."},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's why I want you to\nknow what a terminal alkyne is"},"486":{"dur":0,"text":"when I refer to that."},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"And this other one where\nthere's

to those terms."},"509":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay so, you know, as far"},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"as physical properties\nthere's not a whole lot"},"513":{"dur":1,"text":"for us to say about alkynes."},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"I'll simply point out that\nthe alkyne function group is,"},"519":{"dur":3,"text":"it's not like there's\noxygen or some sort"},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"of

and organic chemistry."},"537":{"dur":3,"text":"We use that for chromatography\nspecifically"},"541":{"dur":1,"text":"because it's non-polar."},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I'll just write out here\nhexyne so we can compare that."},"547":{"dur":4,"text":"And so let's imagine\nadding an alkene to that,"},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"introduce some unsaturation."},"553":{"dur":5,"text":"That would be hexyne,\nspecifically 1 hexyne,"},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm not going to\nworry about that."},"561":{"dur":2,"text":"And now let me draw\na 4 carbon chain,"},"564":{"dur":3,"text":"here's 3 carbons,\n4, 5 and 6 carbons."},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"So this would be 1 hexyne."},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"And if we compare\nthe boiling points"},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"of these molecules they all have"},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"about the same boiling\npoint, same sort of range."},"579":{"dur":5,"text":"Boiling points are around 60 to\n80 degrees for these, Celsius."},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay

carbon,"},"600":{"dur":1,"text":"simple carbon based\nfunctional group."},"602":{"dur":1,"text":"So in other words there's all\nthese sections in the book"},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"that talk about the\nnaming of alkynes."},"606":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not going to ask you\nhow IUPAC nomenclature"},"608":{"dur":1,"text":"or the properties of alkynes."},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's not a whole\nlot to discuss as far"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"as hydrogen bonding\nor boiling points."},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"And then in section 11.4 they\ntalk about examples of alkynes."},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"And I want to encourage you to\nread through that section just"},"621":{"dur":3,"text":"to understand why should I spend\ntime learning about

some,"},"634":{"dur":3,"text":"a frog [phonetic] toxin\ncalled histrionica toxin"},"637":{"dur":4,"text":"or the birth control\ncompound ethinyl estradiol"},"642":{"dur":3,"text":"but again I don't

of atoms and bombs."},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"So let's talk about\nsome chemical reactions."},"669":{"dur":1,"text":"So how do you make alkynes?"},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's go ahead and start\noff right out the gate here"},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"with a reaction that you\nhave quite seen before."},"676":{"dur":0,"text":"What I'm going to\ndo is I'm going"},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"to show you two

moment."},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'll show you a reaction\nwhere you take a strong base,"},"693":{"dur":1,"text":"an immensely powerful base."},"695":{"dur":4,"text":"So you can see I've\ngot 2 isopropyl groups."},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"And in between these 2 isopropyl\ngroups I've got 2 carbons."},"705":{"dur":3,"text":"And so if I want to make an\nalkyne I can't just have a"},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"single bromide out of there\nbecause if I treat this"},"711":{"dur":1,"text":"with a base all I'll\nget is an alkene."},"713":{"dur":1,"text":"So here's one way\nto make an alkyne."},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"Is you have to have 2 BRs."},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"So we can eliminate HBr twice."},"719":{"dur":4,"text":"So if we do two eliminations\nof HBr."},"723":{"dur":3,"text":"And we're going to want to use\nsome powerfully basic conditions"},"727":{"dur":1,"text":"in order to make this happen."},"729":{"dur":3,"text":"And so in this particular case\nwe have to eliminate HBr once"},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"and the twice, we do\nthat all in the same pot."},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"And so we're going to\nadd two

that's basic."},"750":{"dur":4,"text":"God, that is so,\nwe'll talk about that."},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"It's super basic, sodium amide."},"757":{"dur":3,"text":"So again what you can't see\nand I'll draw it for you."},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"And I want to draw it small"},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"because typically I wouldn't\ndraw these hydrogen atoms"},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"for you but I'm just\ngoing to remind you"},"766":{"dur":1,"text":"that there's a hydrogen\natom here"},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"and then there's a\nhydrogen atom down here."},"772":{"dur":1,"text":"And so you're losing 2 HBrs."},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"You're just doing to\n2 E2 eliminations."},"776":{"dur":3,"text":"We'll talk about this\nmore in just a little bit."},"780":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay, so what's another type"},"781":{"dur":4,"text":"of [inaudible] you could\nuse to make an alkyne?"},"787":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll draw another halide here."},"789":{"dur":9,"text":"[ pause ]"},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"And you could do the\nsame two equivalents"},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"of sodium amide base."},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, in terms of\nnomenclature that you would call"},"809":{"dur":3,"text":"that amide, sodium amide."},"812":{"dur":3,"text":"But I try to emphasize\nwhat the word amide"},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"because there's another\nfunctional group called an amide"},"818":{"dur":1,"text":"and I don't want to\ndistinguish that."},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"So if it irritates\nyou just get over it"},"822":{"dur":1,"text":"that I'm calling it amide."},"824":{"dur":2,"text":"Chemists might say gee, why\nare you distorting the name"},"827":{"dur":0,"text":"like that?"},"828":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I'm going to write\npotassium t-butoxide."},"830":{"dur":3,"text":"The book writes the molecular\nformula, the structural formula"},"834":{"dur":1,"text":"out but you'll find I'm going"},"835":{"dur":3,"text":"to start abbreviating\npotassium t-butoxide like this."},"839":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I'll expect you to know\nthat that means t-butoxide."},"843":{"dur":6,"text":"So tert-butyl [inaudible] or\nI might draw a t-bo potassium."},"850":{"dur":2,"text":"But this is potassium t-butoxide"},"853":{"dur":1,"text":"that you've already\nseen a lot of."},"854":{"dur":3,"text":"Now as we will see shortly\npotassium t-butoxide is nowhere"},"858":{"dur":2,"text":"near as powerful\nas sodium amide."},"861":{"dur":2,"text":"So whether the book does\nit or not, if you're trying"},"864":{"dur":2,"text":"to make an

this reaction."},"897":{"dur":4,"text":"Here's two of the three H's on\nthat carbon atom at the end."},"902":{"dur":2,"text":"So, okay, so two\ndifferent reactions."},"905":{"dur":3,"text":"You could

that."},"915":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can see that\nthese two types"},"917":{"dur":1,"text":"of substrates are\nsubtly different."},"919":{"dur":3,"text":"So on the top substrate\nI've got the two

you get\nwhen you add bromide"},"931":{"dur":0,"text":"across a double bond."},"932":{"dur":2,"text":"So you already know how to\nmake substrates like this."},"935":{"dur":2,"text":"We called this a\nvicinal dibromide."},"938":{"dur":4,"text":"And that means they're\non neighboring carbons."},"943":{"dur":3,"text":"And down over here where the two\nhalogens are on the same
