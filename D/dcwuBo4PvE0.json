--"},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"(Applause)"},"662":{"dur":5,"text":"How can we rebuild respect for truth\nand evidence into our liberal democracies?"},"668":{"dur":1,"text":"It has to begin with education,"},"670":{"dur":3,"text":"but it has to start with the recognition\nthat there are huge gaps."},"674":{"dur":4,"text":"In 2014, the pollster Ipsos MORI"},"678":{"dur":3,"text":"published a survey\non attitudes to immigration,"},"681":{"dur":4,"text":"and it showed that as numbers\nof immigrants increase,"},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"so public concern\nwith immigration also increases,"},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"although it obviously\ndidn't unpack causality,"},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"because this could equally be to do\nnot so much with numbers"},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"but the political\nand media narrative around it."},"697":{"dur":3,"text":"But the same survey also revealed"},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"huge public misinformation"},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"and misunderstanding\nabout the nature of immigration."},"707":{"dur":3,"text":"For example, in these attitudes\nin the United Kingdom,"},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"the public believed that levels of asylum"},"713":{"dur":3,"text":"were a greater proportion\nof immigration than they were,"},"716":{"dur":3,"text":"but they also believed\nthe levels of educational migration"},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"were far lower as a proportion\nof overall migration"},"723":{"dur":1,"text":"than they actually are."},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"So we have to address this

schools,"},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"although that's important\nto begin at an early age."},"737":{"dur":3,"text":"It has to be about lifelong\ncivic participation"},"740":{"dur":4,"text":"and public engagement\nthat we all encourage as societies."},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"The second thing\nthat I think is an opportunity"},"748":{"dur":4,"text":"is the idea to encourage more interaction\nacross diverse communities."},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"(Applause)"},"757":{"dur":2,"text":"One of the things that stands out\nfor me very strikingly,"},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"looking at immigration attitudes\nin the United Kingdom,"},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"is that ironically,\nthe regions of my country"},"766":{"dur":1,"text":"that are the most tolerant of

know"},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"and whose views we might\nnot necessarily agree with."},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"The third thing that I think\nis crucial, though,"},"809":{"dur":1,"text":"and this is really fundamental,"},"811":{"dur":2,"text":"is we have to ensure that everybody shares"},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"in the benefits of globalization."},"816":{"dur":4,"text":"This illustration from the

ideas\nI spent a lot of my time preaching,"},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"mainly to developing countries\naround the world,"},"855":{"dur":3,"text":"is that in order to encourage\nthe integration of refugees,"},"858":{"dur":2,"text":"we can't just benefit\nthe refugee populations,"},"861":{"dur":5,"text":"we also have to address the concerns\nof the host communities in local areas."},"867":{"dur":1,"text":"But in looking at that,"},"868":{"dur":3,"text":"one of the policy prescriptions\nis that we have to provide"},"871":{"dur":3,"text":"disproportionately better\neducation facilities, health facilities,"},"875":{"dur":1,"text":"access to social services"},"877":{"dur":2,"text":"in those regions of high immigration"},"879":{"dur":2,"text":"to address the concerns\nof those local populations."},"882":{"dur":2,"text":"But while we encourage that\naround the developing world,"},"885":{"dur":1,"text":"we don't take those lessons home"},"886":{"dur":2,"text":"and incorporate them in our own societies."},"890":{"dur":3,"text":"Furthermore, if we're going\nto really take seriously"},"893":{"dur":3,"text":"the need to ensure people share\nin the economic benefits,"},"896":{"dur":3,"text":"our businesses and corporations\nneed a model of globalization"},"900":{"dur":3,"text":"that recognizes that they, too,\nhave to take people with them."},"905":{"dur":3,"text":"The fourth and final idea\nI want to put forward"},"908":{"dur":2,"text":"is an idea that we need\nmore responsible politics."},"912":{"dur":3,"text":"There's very little\nsocial science evidence"},"915":{"dur":2,"text":"that compares attitudes on globalization."},"918":{"dur":2,"text":"But from the surveys that do exist,"},"920":{"dur":4,"text":"what we can see is there's huge variation\nacross different countries"},"925":{"dur":2,"text":"and time periods in those countries"},"927":{"dur":1,"text":"for attitudes and tolerance"},"929":{"dur":3,"text":"of questions like migration\nand mobility on the one hand"},"932":{"dur":2,"text":"and free trade on the other."},"934":{"dur":5,"text":"But one hypothesis that I think emerges\nfrom a cursory look at that data"},"940":{"dur":6,"text":"is the idea that polarized societies\nare far less tolerant of globalization."},"946":{"dur":2,"text":"It's the societies\nlike Sweden in the past,"},"949":{"dur":1,"text":"like Canada today,"},"950":{"dur":1,"text":"where there is a centrist politics,"},"952":{"dur":2,"text":"where right and left work together,"},"954":{"dur":4,"text":"that we encourage supportive attitudes\ntowards globalization."},"958":{"dur":3,"text":"And what we see around the world today\nis a tragic polarization,"},"962":{"dur":3,"text":"a failure to have dialogue\nbetween the extremes in politics,"},"965":{"dur":2,"text":"and a gap in terms\nof that liberal center
