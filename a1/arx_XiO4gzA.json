It"},"543":{"dur":7,"text":"is a really powerful concept when you actually\ntake the time to sit, digest and actually"},"550":{"dur":7,"text":"apply it to your business. I first saw this\nbeing applied really well from an investing"},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"standpoint. And obviously, we speak more about\nmarketing and business and stuff like that,"},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"and we'll definitely combine it back to that\nin a moment."},"564":{"dur":5,"text":"But a really good way of seeing and gaining\nsome clarity around this Zero Based Thinking"},"570":{"dur":7,"text":"is from an investment standpoint. Let me say\nit a different way. One of my very first stockbrokers"},"577":{"dur":6,"text":"or advisers told me years and years ago was\nbasically like, if you consider midnight every"},"583":{"dur":5,"text":"night you sell your shares and you buy them\nback with no brokerage fee l so basically,"},"589":{"dur":5,"text":"midnight every night, you have to physically\nwipe your stock and re-buy it.

I'll"},"626":{"dur":4,"text":"make more money.'' They hold onto the losers\nand kill the winners. Everyone has heard that"},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"sort of analogy with stock market trading,\nright?"},"634":{"dur":4,"text":">> Dom: Yeah, yeah.\n>> Pete: So basically, that's a similar concept"},"639":{"dur":4,"text":"of Zero Based Thinking. At midnight, you wipe\nthe slate clean, you wipe you trading account"},"644":{"dur":5,"text":"clean, you go to a zero base. Would you buy\nthose stocks again? And so many people actually"},"649":{"dur":5,"text":"wouldn't, yet they still happen to hold onto\ntheir stocks. It's just a very poor investment"},"655":{"dur":6,"text":"choice because it means you're chasing your\nlosers. Having that question answered with"},"661":{"dur":4,"text":"some clarity helps you to take the emotion\nout of the stock trading, which I think is"},"665":{"dur":5,"text":"really cool.\nI heard this again applied in another sort"},"670":{"dur":5,"text":"of investing space from a friend of mine,\nSteve McKnight, who's the No. 1 bestselling"},"676":{"dur":7,"text":"author in Australia around property investing.\nHe spoke about this concept in the concept"},"684":{"dur":5,"text":"of holding real estate as well. There are\nso many people who have an investment property"},"689":{"dur":5,"text":"and they have all this money tied up into\nproperty, all this equity. Now, if you had"},"695":{"dur":4,"text":"that equity in your bank today, if you had\n$100,000 of equity sitting in your bank, would"},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"you buy that property or would you go and\nleverage that money better and buy two or"},"704":{"dur":5,"text":"three properties at a higher loan ratio or\nsomething like that?"},"709":{"dur":5,"text":"That concept is, again, a Zero Based Thinking-type\nof approach.

Again, it's another way"},"752":{"dur":5,"text":"to apply Zero Based Thinking to an asset.\nIn this instance, a property. And then obviously,"},"758":{"dur":6,"text":"we can go and start applying this to your\nbusiness and your marketing because it's really"},"764":{"dur":6,"text":"important to assess your business on a regular\nbasis, taking this Zero Based approach."},"771":{"dur":7,"text":">> Dom: That's really cool, I really like\nthat.
