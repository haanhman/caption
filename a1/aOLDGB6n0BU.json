Most people"},"140":{"dur":3,"text":"didn't travel more than about 20\nkilometers from where they were born"},"143":{"dur":4,"text":"through most of their lives. And it's\nonly in the last 150"},"148":{"dur":5,"text":"years or so that unless you were a soldier or you went to sea that you actually traveled"},"153":{"dur":5,"text":"a significant distance from where you\nwere born during a lot of your life. So"},"158":{"dur":7,"text":"in periods before that actually it wasn't\nseen as something you had any"},"166":{"dur":5,"text":"expectation of being able to achieve,\ntravel. It's a relatively recent"},"171":{"dur":6,"text":"phenomenon in generational terms. Now we tend to regard the opportunity to travel"},"178":{"dur":4,"text":"as a human right.  If you've got the money\nyou can travel anywhere on the planet"},"182":{"dur":3,"text":"and I've just done that in terms of going\nhalfway around the planet"},"185":{"dur":5,"text":"to be here. And it's purely a matter of\neconomics and finance as to whether or"},"190":{"dur":1,"text":"not you can do it."},"192":{"dur":4,"text":"Plus or minus those countries that limit\nthe ability of their citizens to travel,"},"196":{"dur":5,"text":"and sadly that's just a piece of paper\nor not having a piece of paper which is"},"201":{"dur":8,"text":"a sad situation with regard to the human\nrace. So the infrastructure that supports"},"209":{"dur":3,"text":"travel is also therefore a relatively\nnew phenomenon, whether its roads or"},"213":{"dur":7,"text":"canals or railway systems or aviation\nsystems. And if you look again at the"},"221":{"dur":5,"text":"history particularly in, I will say no more about western Europe. Is the roads that we've"},"226":{"dur":4,"text":"inherited in England were largely roads\nthat were built by the military in Roman"},"231":{"dur":3,"text":"times and they're dead straight lines\nthat go between where they had big"},"235":{"dur":4,"text":"encampments. So a lot of our main\nroads in London, sorry in Britain, are still"},"239":{"dur":4,"text":"built on the back of those Roman roads. If you put one on top of the other you find we"},"243":{"dur":5,"text":"haven't moved those roads very much. That is an example of the legacy of the"},"249":{"dur":5,"text":"infrastructure to support transport and\ntravel which we've inherited and indeed"},"255":{"dur":3,"text":"every city now has inherited.  In the sense\nthat the first generation of"},"259":{"dur":3,"text":"infrastructure that supports travel that\nis put in by the first generation that"},"263":{"dur":5,"text":"live in a city, make it quite difficult\nfor any subsequent generations to change"},"268":{"dur":4,"text":"what it was was put in at the first time.\nin London we're investing a huge amount"},"272":{"dur":5,"text":"of money at the moment transforming some of that because London as the megacity"},"277":{"dur":3,"text":"of Europe has realized that unless it does\nthat it's not going to sustain itself"},"280":{"dur":3,"text":"for the next twenty or thirty years, so\nwe're spending tens of billions of"},"284":{"dur":4,"text":"pounds in London transforming the way in\nwhich our travel infrastructure and"},"288":{"dur":4,"text":"transport infrastructure is constructed\nand it's different from what we have had"},"293":{"dur":5,"text":"that was built in Victorian times.  So I\nwanted to touch on that because travel"},"298":{"dur":4,"text":"is to some extent limited by the\nphysical infrastructure that we have put"},"303":{"dur":5,"text":"in over over a period of decades or\ncenturies and that limitation is"},"308":{"dur":3,"text":"something one has to take account of it\nis clearly something that in this"},"311":{"dur":1,"text":"country you also have to take"},"312":{"dur":5,"text":"account of even though you're a much younger country than we are. So what I first want to"},"318":{"dur":4,"text":"just make sure we understand is the\nmodes of travel that we think we're"},"323":{"dur":4,"text":"going to be able to use. So this is just\na cartoon of all the things that are"},"328":{"dur":5,"text":"relevant to your ability to think about\ntraveling. And you'll recognize most of"},"333":{"dur":6,"text":"those that you either use or  have used either for business purposes"},"339":{"dur":6,"text":"or for leisure purposes, both within New\nZealand and outside New Zealand. And that"},"346":{"dur":5,"text":"of course applies everywhere. One of the\nthings that most of you will also realize is"},"351":{"dur":5,"text":"that with one or two exceptions they all\nneed energy. So you can't actually say"},"357":{"dur":5,"text":"very much about traveling unless you've\ngot energy sources. And some of them of"},"362":{"dur":3,"text":"course like a balloon, the energy sources\nare a somewhat random one, it's the wind"},"366":{"dur":3,"text":"and you go where the wind takes you\nand that actually is more of an"},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"exploration than a journey because you\nactually don't know we're going to end"},"373":{"dur":3,"text":"up. And a journey where you know where you want to end up, a balloon is not a"},"377":{"dur":4,"text":"particularly helpful device to use. So all the \nothers need energy in order to direct"},"381":{"dur":3,"text":"you to where you want to be. So one of\nthe things we've discovered, which may"},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"sound a bit but philosophical, is that\nyou can't talk about travel without"},"388":{"dur":4,"text":"talking about energy. And if you don't\nhave sustainable reliable resilient"},"392":{"dur":4,"text":"energy sources of the right type then\nyour travel options are somewhat limited."},"397":{"dur":5,"text":"And as we enter into an era of trying to\nreduce the amount of fuel we burn"},"402":{"dur":6,"text":"in from hydrocarbon sources to enable\ntravel systems to work. That becomes a"},"409":{"dur":5,"text":"problem. In our country, half the energy\nthat we use is in the form of fuel in"},"414":{"dur":7,"text":"transport, half.  So people talk about\nreduction in energy consumption as if"},"422":{"dur":4,"text":"reducing electricity consumption is\ngoing to be - or  changing the way"},"426":{"dur":3,"text":"in which we source electricity - is going to\nbe the right way of dealing with the"},"430":{"dur":4,"text":"carbon emissions problem.  It will only\nreduce it if you do something to"},"434":{"dur":5,"text":"transport as well.  And that's a really\nimportant factor and I'll say something"},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"about electric vehicles and autonomous"},"441":{"dur":5,"text":"vehicles later. So the other aspect\nof travel is you need infrastructure on"},"447":{"dur":7,"text":"which to run your transport systems and\nsome of them are sort of interlinked. You"},"454":{"dur":4,"text":"may be able to recognize,  this is a set\nof roads adjacent to an airport.  So we're"},"459":{"dur":7,"text":"using roads and aviation as a coupled\nset of systems. And we also forget on"},"466":{"dur":5,"text":"occasions that most of us who import and\nexport goods rely heavily on the ability"},"472":{"dur":4,"text":"for ports to operate effectively and\nefficiently, and in our country we've got"},"477":{"dur":5,"text":"about three weeks of food in the UK. We\nimport a lot. You import quite a lot of"},"482":{"dur":5,"text":"manufactured goods in this country, so\nthe efficiency of ports operating is"},"488":{"dur":3,"text":"really very important. And I will come back\nto one of the factors that makes ports"},"492":{"dur":5,"text":"work very efficiently in a moment because you might not know that it's a factor. We"},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"like you have a certain amount of\nrailway systems. We have a lot of railway"},"500":{"dur":4,"text":"systems actually.  Most of our systems\nwere built in the 19th century. We"},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"decommissioned about a third of it in\nthe 1960s and now we're"},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"trying to put some of it back because the\narguments on which we decommissioned"},"512":{"dur":9,"text":"it were fallacious and driven by pure economics.  If that's not a misrepresentation of"},"521":{"dur":5,"text":"economics and lastly of course we have\nto see that all of these modes of"},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"transport are interlinked with each\nother.  So"},"530":{"dur":5,"text":"they share this space. It's quite important to realize that certain modes of transport"},"535":{"dur":4,"text":"share infrastructure space and some\ndon't.  And its roads that are the major"},"539":{"dur":5,"text":"problem, in the sense that roads are the\ninfrastructure space that is"},"545":{"dur":5,"text":"shared by a number of different modes of\ntransport. Aviation is sort of only"},"551":{"dur":7,"text":"aircraft and ships are the only form on\nthe sea and railways."},"558":{"dur":5,"text":"So roads are an interesting phenomena\nin terms of the infrastructure in that"},"564":{"dur":3,"text":"it is shared between bicycles and\nmotorbikes and cars and lorries and"},"568":{"dur":7,"text":"trucks and buses.  All the others tend\nto be mono vehicle. The other aspect I"},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"want to talk about is our appetite for\nrisk before I start talking a bit more"},"578":{"dur":4,"text":"about where travel is going and a little bit  about history.  When we built a lot of"},"583":{"dur":4,"text":"our infrastructure in Victorian times in\nthe 19th century, the appetite for"},"587":{"dur":5,"text":"risk taking in the building of \nthose systems was huge, partly because"},"592":{"dur":4,"text":"the way in which we went about doing it\nwas owned by very few, very rich people."},"597":{"dur":6,"text":"Like a few thousand people.  They owned\nall the land, all the money.  They weren't"},"603":{"dur":3,"text":"taxed. They bribed their way into\nParliament so they owned all the"},"606":{"dur":5,"text":"executive decisions, and without making\nany ethical statement, labor was free and"},"612":{"dur":4,"text":"disposable.  It either came from Ireland\nor  it came from some other part of"},"617":{"dur":3,"text":"the Commonwealth. What we would now call the Commonwealth was called the Empire"},"620":{"dur":6,"text":"at the time. So between about 1840 and 1880 we did some fantastic civil engineering"},"627":{"dur":4,"text":"constructions, which built our railway\nsystem, some of our Turnpike's which then"},"631":{"dur":5,"text":"turned into our main roads. And as a\nresult, we now, 150 years on"},"637":{"dur":4,"text":"have inherited a hugely capable, but now\naging and decaying, railway infrastructure."},"642":{"dur":7,"text":"The health of which we know very little\nabout because  it wasn't very little design was"},"649":{"dur":3,"text":"put on the ground they just built it. We\ndon't know what's underneath the"},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"foundations of a lot of it.  We have\n40,000 bridges in the railway system"},"656":{"dur":3,"text":"system and a lot of them are more than a\nhundred years old and we are now running"},"660":{"dur":4,"text":"more trains, heavier trains, faster trains\nand it's slightly worrying that that is the"},"664":{"dur":5,"text":"case.  So the attitude to risk taking was\nhuge and now we're in a position where"},"669":{"dur":5,"text":"not only are we as engineers and\nscientists and builders and architects"},"674":{"dur":5,"text":"more risk averse. What is also true is\nour politicians - sorry if there are any  politicians in"},"679":{"dur":4,"text":"the room - are also very risk averse.\nPartly because the media won't let them"},"684":{"dur":5,"text":"take risks. So there is a media\/political\/\ncapital intersection around not only"},"690":{"dur":6,"text":"transport and journeys but also\naround infrastructure in general. And one"},"697":{"dur":4,"text":"of our anxieties is if we don't manage to\nstart managing taking bigger risks."},"701":{"dur":5,"text":"Not taking bigger risks without managing\nthem, we won't be able to modernize our"},"706":{"dur":3,"text":"infrastructure into the place which\nmakes it fit for the next century."},"710":{"dur":3,"text":"So we have to find a way of taking more\nrisk but in a controlled and managed way"},"713":{"dur":4,"text":"than we've been doing for the last forty or\nfifty years. And that is why I just wanted to say"},"718":{"dur":4,"text":"something about risk-taking as well as\nrisk managing because when you are in a"},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"situation where your first or second\ngeneration of transport infrastructure"},"726":{"dur":4,"text":"is limiting your ability to travel. And in\norder to get out of that lock-in"},"730":{"dur":3,"text":"situation, you've got to take some risks, and that means managing them in order that"},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"you don't produce perverse outcomes. And\nit's not just technical risk, it's"},"738":{"dur":2,"text":"political and financial risk."},"740":{"dur":6,"text":"Emphasised managing them, not just taking them. So what we are now dealing with is"},"747":{"dur":6,"text":"increasingly complex systems in which we\nare attempting to travel.  Transport as I"},"754":{"dur":5,"text":"indicated is not isolated from a lot of\nother areas. And there is two in this diagram which I"},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"wanted to touch on as all those things\ncame up and I hope you recognize most of"},"763":{"dur":4,"text":"them as they built. Is firstly on the\nbottom right hand corner, the cloud, the"},"767":{"dur":3,"text":"IT people in the world will say no\nit's a datacentre. Well it is, but it's"},"770":{"dur":4,"text":"what now most people call the cloud. And\nif you think you're going to build a"},"775":{"dur":4,"text":"smart infrastructure in order to provide\nsmart journeys, the data and the"},"779":{"dur":4,"text":"information gets held and processed\nsomewhere. And the cloud is where it"},"783":{"dur":0,"text":"happens."},"784":{"dur":5,"text":"But you may not know where the data\ncentre is that makes up the cloud, and that"},"789":{"dur":4,"text":"matters if it's personal information,\nwhich increasingly you want because you want"},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"personalised journey optimisation."},"796":{"dur":3,"text":"It matters where it's held because if\nyour personal information is held in a"},"799":{"dur":4,"text":"country other than the one in which you\nhave the jurisdiction, you won't be able"},"803":{"dur":5,"text":"to control the exploitation of your\npersonal data.  And that for some countries is"},"809":{"dur":4,"text":"a really big issue.  It's a big issue in\nour country at the moment and people"},"813":{"dur":5,"text":"are really worried about identity management and identity fraud and personal information"},"818":{"dur":4,"text":"being exploited for the wrong purposes\nas they see it.  The second area which is"},"822":{"dur":3,"text":"important is in the top right corner. You\nmay think what have satellites got to do"},"826":{"dur":2,"text":"with my journey."},"829":{"dur":3,"text":"Well first of all the clock of the world\nis on the GPS network of satellites."},"833":{"dur":4,"text":"Everything in this room would stop\ninstantly if the GPS satellites went"},"837":{"dur":3,"text":"down.  All your mobile phones would stop\nworking. All the lights would go out. This"},"840":{"dur":1,"text":"microphone would stop working."},"842":{"dur":4,"text":"The clocks that drive everything are \ndriven by GPS.  There is almost no redundancy"},"846":{"dur":4,"text":"being put into new systems because\nit's too expensive to do that because"},"850":{"dur":4,"text":"GPS is for free. It's in your mobile\nphones and you don't even know most of"},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"the time that's what's keeping\neverything running in your phone and all"},"858":{"dur":4,"text":"the backbone of your phones. But it also,\nsatellite's not just GPS that provides"},"863":{"dur":3,"text":"meteorological information, provides earth resource information, communication"},"866":{"dur":4,"text":"satellites and a lot of what we now\noperate with is actually dependent upon"},"871":{"dur":1,"text":"space systems working properly"},"873":{"dur":6,"text":"all the time 24 by 7.  And that dependency\nreally does impact transport. Almost all"},"879":{"dur":6,"text":"transport would stop. And I did mention\njust now the issue of ports. Big tankers"},"886":{"dur":6,"text":"and big freighters are docks using GPS\nwith minimetric accuracy. And about four"},"892":{"dur":4,"text":"weeks ago,  the US government\ndecommissioned one of the GPS satellites"},"897":{"dur":4,"text":"in order to upload some new software to it. But they"},"902":{"dur":3,"text":"forgot to put in the corrections to all\nthe other satellites that needed to be"},"906":{"dur":4,"text":"because one was taken out, and that meant the locational accuracy in certain parts"},"911":{"dur":6,"text":"of the world was 400 metres out.  If you're \ndocking a 200,000 tonne tanker by GPS"},"918":{"dur":3,"text":"without knowing exactly where it is.  If\nno one looked out the window at the"},"921":{"dur":4,"text":"point you could do billions of\ndollars worth of damage to your port"},"926":{"dur":5,"text":"and your tanker as it ran into the\nground at whatever speed it was going. So"},"931":{"dur":3,"text":"I just wanted to make sure we understood\nthat when we talk about travel, we're"},"934":{"dur":3,"text":"talking about it in the context\nof a whole set of complex engineered"},"938":{"dur":5,"text":"systems. And in some socio-technical\nsystems as well, one of which is"},"943":{"dur":4,"text":"illustrated by the tower in which the\nclock Big Ben sits because that's the"},"948":{"dur":4,"text":"complexity of a democratic government.\nAnd that in itself is a complex socio-political"},"953":{"dur":4,"text":"system and you have a\nversion of it here as well. It's different"},"958":{"dur":3,"text":"from ours. And every \ndeveloped democratic country is"},"961":{"dur":4,"text":"different. In fact, every country is different. So we depend upon the complex social system"},"966":{"dur":4,"text":"of governance as well as the engineered\nsystems and that affects how we think"},"970":{"dur":5,"text":"about travel as well. So, these are the\nsorts of things that make up this"},"976":{"dur":5,"text":"complex system. First of all the things\nare rapidly changing and uncertain, so we"},"981":{"dur":4,"text":"have to make decisions as has been\nillustrated in the briefing about the"},"986":{"dur":6,"text":"engagement for for this project just now\nin a rapidly changing world. There is"},"992":{"dur":4,"text":"uncertainty. So we need to find\nmechanisms by which we handle"},"996":{"dur":5,"text":"that uncertainty. In certain areas its global\nof course.  If you're talking aviation or logistics"},"1001":{"dur":5,"text":"for long haul freight, a lot of our transport and"},"1007":{"dur":4,"text":"journey enabling systems are privatized\nwe have found it to be more economically"},"1011":{"dur":5,"text":"efficient, financially efficient, but is\nit more effective. Well we're still"},"1017":{"dur":3,"text":"experimenting with the balance between\nprivate ownership and non private"},"1020":{"dur":4,"text":"ownership in transport systems. In our\ncountry we've gone really overboard to"},"1024":{"dur":3,"text":"privatize. Personal opinion, I'm not sure\nwe've got that exactly"},"1028":{"dur":4,"text":"in the right place.  Financial and\neconomic efficiency may not deliver"},"1032":{"dur":5,"text":"social effectiveness. We need to achieve\nsustainability. I was talking to colleagues"},"1037":{"dur":3,"text":"about sustainability earlier. What do we\nreally mean by sustainability over what"},"1041":{"dur":4,"text":"period. Because sustainability can lock you in, but it can also give you adaptability."},"1045":{"dur":4,"text":"And of course we're trying to achieve a\nmuch lower, if not zero carbon emission"},"1049":{"dur":5,"text":"from transport systems. We want more\nengagement, as is absolutely true this"},"1055":{"dur":4,"text":"evening, in democratization of\nengagement of processes in"},"1059":{"dur":4,"text":"journey planning so that our journeys\nand hence our travel experiences is"},"1064":{"dur":5,"text":"better democratized.  And how we create\nvalue in our society as a result of the"},"1069":{"dur":3,"text":"journey,  rather than lack of value,\nbecause we get fed up with"},"1072":{"dur":5,"text":"congestion or overcrowding or delay or  accidents. The internet of things"},"1077":{"dur":5,"text":"may be a way in which we enable \ntransport and journeys to be better. But"},"1083":{"dur":4,"text":"it may also be a vulnerability because\nit may also become a a dependency we"},"1087":{"dur":4,"text":"don't know how to handle. We are\ndependent on global supply. We are"},"1091":{"dur":6,"text":"dependent upon innovation, but it may be\nconstrained by safety.  And as I've"},"1097":{"dur":4,"text":"already indicated I hope, the\ninfrastructure in support of travel is"},"1102":{"dur":3,"text":"one which where the interdependencies\nwith all the other infrastructure"},"1105":{"dur":4,"text":"components is getting deeper and richer...\nand is yet relatively ungoverned because"},"1110":{"dur":3,"text":"it tends to be an operational issue that is\nfixed at the time of building things"},"1114":{"dur":5,"text":"rather than designed at the point\nof early stages of programme"},"1119":{"dur":5,"text":"conceptualisation. So the nature of\ntravel first of all, is what's the"},"1124":{"dur":4,"text":"purpose?  Why are we travelling? And if you can't answer that question in terms of"},"1129":{"dur":1,"text":"investment, then"},"1130":{"dur":5,"text":"don't do it. So one of the issues that I\nthink we're facing across the world is"},"1136":{"dur":4,"text":"are there alternatives to travel, where\nthe cost of putting in the means by"},"1140":{"dur":3,"text":"which we would otherwise do it  become prohibitive. And I say costs in the"},"1144":{"dur":4,"text":"broadest sense of the word cost, because if we don't understand the purpose.  Is it to"},"1148":{"dur":3,"text":"get people to work? Is it to get people\nto school? Is it to get people to see"},"1151":{"dur":3,"text":"their family? Is it to go for leisure\nactivities? The answer could be all of"},"1155":{"dur":4,"text":"those, and a mixture of them.  But if you\ncan't articulate it then why would you do"},"1159":{"dur":5,"text":"it. And what is the value to I, myself\nas an individual, and to the community"},"1164":{"dur":4,"text":"which is affected by my traveling\npurpose is also something that needs to"},"1169":{"dur":3,"text":"be articulated. It is not just about me.  It\nis about the use of the shared"},"1173":{"dur":4,"text":"infrastructure and the shared platforms\non which we travel. Now actually, the"},"1177":{"dur":4,"text":"private car, of course, is the epitome of\nmy castle on wheels that I travel around"},"1182":{"dur":6,"text":"in a shared space. It's the nearest thing I can do to not share in a travel"},"1189":{"dur":3,"text":"experience because all public forms of transport are like that.  Of course, your bicycle is also a"},"1193":{"dur":4,"text":"private space but it's a bit\nmore exposed than your car. But"},"1197":{"dur":6,"text":"never-the-less the value to me is that. Now\nto whom does the value accrue, when you"},"1203":{"dur":5,"text":"compare it with, the cost that\nI'm going to incur. And quite often the cost"},"1209":{"dur":4,"text":"is is placed in one place and the value accrues somewhere else. And our accounting"},"1213":{"dur":5,"text":"systems do not take very good account of that. We do the cost accounting"},"1219":{"dur":4,"text":"around where the implementation costs\nare and yet the value accrues"},"1224":{"dur":5,"text":"somewhere else. In my time at the DFT I\nsaw massive numbers of examples where"},"1229":{"dur":3,"text":"the accounting principles were\nreally getting in the way of doing the"},"1233":{"dur":5,"text":"right thing.  Everyone knew what the right\nthing was, but the accounting processes and"},"1238":{"dur":5,"text":"the contracting processes limited\nour ability to deliver on"},"1244":{"dur":6,"text":"that. And so going further and saying, so\nif I did all of that, you still have"},"1251":{"dur":4,"text":"to worry about how acceptable the solutions that you might come up with, with regard to my, or my"},"1255":{"dur":7,"text":"community's desires to achieve a travel purpose might be.
