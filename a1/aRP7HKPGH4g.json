was raised there."},"52":{"dur":2,"text":"And I moved to Holland when\nI was 10 years old."},"55":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'm a bit of everything, as\nI believe that you are all a"},"58":{"dur":4,"text":"bit of everything, coming from\nall parts of the world."},"63":{"dur":4,"text":"I would like to tell you a bit\nabout how I actually came here"},"67":{"dur":3,"text":"to stand here in front of you,\nbecause my life did not start"},"70":{"dur":2,"text":"off that way."},"73":{"dur":4,"text":"My dad was a landscape\narchitect, and he wanted to"},"77":{"dur":2,"text":"move from Holland."},"79":{"dur":1,"text":"My parents were both Dutch."},"80":{"dur":2,"text":"He wanted to move from Holland\nto Ireland because it was a"},"83":{"dur":2,"text":"more freer spirit at the time."},"85":{"dur":3,"text":"It was the late '60s, beginning\nof the '70s."},"88":{"dur":2,"text":"And so they started their\nfamily there."},"91":{"dur":1,"text":"They had me and my sister."},"93":{"dur":5,"text":"And we were very much encouraged\nto be artistic."},"98":{"dur":4,"text":"So after spending 10 years\nthere, we moved back to"},"102":{"dur":7,"text":"Amsterdam, and I went to the\nsecondary school in Holland."},"109":{"dur":3,"text":"After staying there, I thought\nI would like to be an artist."},"113":{"dur":3,"text":"My parents had very much\ntold me to be artistic."},"116":{"dur":3,"text":"They had given me all kinds of\npaint and paper and all kinds"},"120":{"dur":3,"text":"of things to encourage us--\nme and my sister both."},"124":{"dur":5,"text":"So I went to the School of the\nArts in Belgium, and when I"},"130":{"dur":3,"text":"was there, I realized, well, I\nmight not be a real artist."},"136":{"dur":2,"text":"It was very hard for\nme, actually."},"138":{"dur":4,"text":"I could do the drawing part, but\nI felt very strange being"},"142":{"dur":3,"text":"in front of big white\nscreens of paper and"},"145":{"dur":0,"text":"thinking, oh my god."},"146":{"dur":2,"text":"What should I paint on this?"},"149":{"dur":6,"text":"So actually, I decided then to\nmove up to the Hague and go"},"156":{"dur":0,"text":"[INAUDIBLE]"},"157":{"dur":2,"text":"be a interior architect."},"159":{"dur":4,"text":"So I studied there for many\nyears in the

everywhere."},"171":{"dur":2,"text":"And because I have been studying\nfor a very long time,"},"174":{"dur":3,"text":"I've been cooking for a\nvery long time, too."},"177":{"dur":1,"text":"I've actually started off\ncooking when I was"},"179":{"dur":1,"text":"only four years old."},"181":{"dur":5,"text":"I would be standing beside my\nmother, and she would cook in"},"186":{"dur":2,"text":"her kitchen, and I would be just\nbeside her on a little"},"189":{"dur":3,"text":"stool and drawing everything\nshe would be cooking."},"192":{"dur":2,"text":"Because when I was four years\nold, I was not able to write,"},"195":{"dur":1,"text":"so I made little drawings."},"196":{"dur":1,"text":"And you will see them back in\nthe book, as I've never"},"198":{"dur":2,"text":"changed that way of\ndrawing things."},"201":{"dur":4,"text":"Sometimes I find that drawings\nare quicker because if you"},"206":{"dur":3,"text":"need to put a sentence down like\n\"pour this into the pot,\""},"209":{"dur":2,"text":"that would be just one\narrow to draw."},"212":{"dur":2,"text":"So sometimes that was quicker."},"214":{"dur":3,"text":"So you will find those things\nback in my work, too."},"217":{"dur":4,"text":"I was doing all these drawings\nat the same time just for fun,"},"222":{"dur":2,"text":"and also for the restaurant\nwhere I worked at."},"225":{"dur":1,"text":"They enjoyed my drawings, too."},"227":{"dur":4,"text":"So I was doing the menus there\nand just doing these little"},"231":{"dur":3,"text":"things on the side while I\nwas studying at school."},"234":{"dur":4,"text":"And we were working in a very\nsmall little breakfast and"},"239":{"dur":2,"text":"lunch joint, where we\nwould cater from at"},"242":{"dur":1,"text":"that particular time."},"244":{"dur":2,"text":"I was working in the kitchen\nwith a very good friend of"},"246":{"dur":4,"text":"mine, and a lot of people came\nup to our kitchen and asked"},"251":{"dur":3,"text":"for recipes because I think our\ncakes were really good."},"254":{"dur":2,"text":"So they were all coming\nup and asking for, can"},"257":{"dur":0,"text":"we have your recipe?"},"258":{"dur":2,"text":"And I would write them down\nfor everybody personally."},"261":{"dur":2,"text":"So we were getting a little\nbit fed up of this because"},"263":{"dur":2,"text":"there were a lot of people\ncoming over."},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"So we decided to make\nour first book."},"268":{"dur":3,"text":"So I talked to the owner of\nthe shop, and they decided"},"271":{"dur":1,"text":"that would be a very\ngood idea."},"273":{"dur":4,"text":"So I wrote the whole book by\nhand at night after school"},"277":{"dur":2,"text":"because I did not know how\nto work a computer."},"279":{"dur":3,"text":"I had never sat beside a\ncomputer before, so I did"},"283":{"dur":3,"text":"everything by hand, and then the\npublisher would scan all"},"287":{"dur":1,"text":"my drawings in."},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"And when I finished the book,\nwe needed a cover."},"291":{"dur":3,"text":"Because we didn't have any\nphotography in it, I made all"},"294":{"dur":4,"text":"the drawings of the\ndishes myself."},"298":{"dur":4,"text":"So for my former work, where I\nworked before, I had met this"},"303":{"dur":4,"text":"nice guy who actually became\na very good friend of mine."},"307":{"dur":1,"text":"So I said, I know\na very nice guy."},"309":{"dur":5,"text":"We can call him and ask him\nif he can shoot our cover."},"314":{"dur":1,"text":"So that was Oof."},"318":{"dur":3,"text":"We went to his studio in\nAmsterdam, and when we"},"322":{"dur":4,"text":"finished the pictures, my two\nfriends who were with me from"},"326":{"dur":4,"text":"the kitchen made a bet that we\nwould be together after that"},"330":{"dur":3,"text":"because we were falling in\nlove over the camera."},"333":{"dur":4,"text":"And we have stayed together\never since."},"337":{"dur":3,"text":"So that was a very nice start\nof my career in cookbooks."},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"But I did not know that at\nthat time, because I"},"343":{"dur":1,"text":"was still in school."},"344":{"dur":4,"text":"I needed to finish my school to"},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"become an interior designer."},"351":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I finished that,\nand I opened up my"},"354":{"dur":2,"text":"first design office."},"357":{"dur":5,"text":"I did this with my sister\nbecause my sister had done a"},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"similar school of the arts in\nAmsterdam, and she was a"},"365":{"dur":1,"text":"graphic designer."},"366":{"dur":5,"text":"So we were both doing jobs,\nespecially for hotels and"},"371":{"dur":1,"text":"restaurants."},"372":{"dur":3,"text":"We would do the menus, do\nthe interior, would"},"375":{"dur":1,"text":"do all these things--"},"376":{"dur":5,"text":"the signing and all these\noutings that they would need."},"382":{"dur":4,"text":"And we were working as designers\nat that time, and I"},"386":{"dur":3,"text":"was missing cooking terribly,\nterribly, because I did not"},"390":{"dur":1,"text":"work as a cook at that time."},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"I would work as a designer."},"394":{"dur":4,"text":"So often, Oof would ask\nme, would you mind?"},"398":{"dur":1,"text":"Just help me out."},"399":{"dur":2,"text":"We have a picture coming in\ntomorrow, and I need someone"},"402":{"dur":3,"text":"to cook a dish because there\nhas to be some food in it."},"405":{"dur":1,"text":"And at that time, I did\nnot know of the"},"407":{"dur":1,"text":"job of a food stylist."},"408":{"dur":1,"text":"I did not know that\nthis existed."},"410":{"dur":4,"text":"It wasn't a real school for\nit or anything, so I just"},"415":{"dur":6,"text":"accidentally got into this job\nas a sort of side job making"},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"lovely plates."},"422":{"dur":4,"text":"And actually, for me, that was\nthe same as working as an"},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"artist because you had to\nmake a composition."},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"You had to really think about\nwhat you were putting on the"},"432":{"dur":4,"text":"plate, trying to put the colors\nand arranging them"},"437":{"dur":3,"text":"differently, and also knowing\nabout cooking because you need"},"441":{"dur":4,"text":"to know how to cook everything\nproperly to make it look good"},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"on a picture."},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"So this was a really,\nreally nice job."},"449":{"dur":0,"text":"I really enjoyed it."},"450":{"dur":3,"text":"And through Oof, and through his\nnetwork of people he knew"},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"at magazines, I got more\nlittle jobs like this."},"456":{"dur":3,"text":"So I was doing this food styling\nthing on the side, and"},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"I got to do little drawings for\nmagazines, or I would be"},"463":{"dur":4,"text":"writing recipes, or all kinds\nof things like that."},"468":{"dur":4,"text":"And this was all my side jobs\njust beside my designing job."},"472":{"dur":6,"text":"So after a couple of years,\nI was working quite hard."},"478":{"dur":4,"text":"And at night, I would say to\nOof, I would really, really"},"483":{"dur":1,"text":"rather bake cakes."},"484":{"dur":4,"text":"I think baking cakes is nicer\nthan walking around building"},"488":{"dur":4,"text":"sites wearing a helmet, talking\nto all these guys who"},"492":{"dur":4,"text":"are doing their work or\njobs well or not."},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"So I thought I might\ngo for it."},"500":{"dur":3,"text":"So I talked to my sister about\nit, and she was actually quite"},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"happy, because she wanted\nto be an artist."},"506":{"dur":4,"text":"And she became one after,\nso that's great."},"511":{"dur":5,"text":"And so we closed down our design\nshop, and I started off"},"516":{"dur":7,"text":"with a catering business\nfrom my home, which was"},"523":{"dur":1,"text":"tough, but it worked."},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"We rented fridges."},"527":{"dur":3,"text":"We lived in Amsterdam at that\ntime, and we had a quite small"},"531":{"dur":3,"text":"house, because in Amsterdam, the\nhouses are not very big."},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"So we had a small house,\nbut a big kitchen."},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"It was actually a big kitchen\nand a bedroom,"},"538":{"dur":0,"text":"something like that."},"539":{"dur":1,"text":"You should think\nof it that way."},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"And we would have all kinds of\nfridges that I would rent down"},"544":{"dur":4,"text":"our living room, and all rental\ncrates with cups and"},"549":{"dur":3,"text":"saucers and everything that came\nin for special occasions"},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"and weddings, and we had\nto carry them all out."},"554":{"dur":5,"text":"And we had groceries down\nthe hallway piling up."},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"So I did this for a couple\nof years like that."},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was working as a food\nstylist, recipe writer."},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"I would do all these\nkinds of jobs, too."},"569":{"dur":4,"text":"So this was getting\na bit out of hand."},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"The jobs were getting bigger."},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"First, I was starting off\ncooking for 30 people."},"577":{"dur":4,"text":"I ended up cooking for 80, 90,\n100 people at that time."},"582":{"dur":5,"text":"So I had a lot of help\nof my cousin, Joris."},"587":{"dur":1,"text":"And he came in."},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"And he was working in a hotel\nat the time, and he came to"},"591":{"dur":5,"text":"He would get people to serve,\nand we were setting out all"},"597":{"dur":3,"text":"the tables while I was\ncooking at events."},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"And he said, well, you\nknow, we need to"},"604":{"dur":1,"text":"find a space together."},"606":{"dur":3,"text":"We could collaborate\nreally well."},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"So we need to find\na space together."},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"So he was really excited."},"613":{"dur":3,"text":"He's a lot younger than I am,\nand he's very, very energetic"},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"and funny and great."},"620":{"dur":3,"text":"So he was running around\nAmsterdam looking for a place."},"623":{"dur":6,"text":"So he found this very tiny\nlittle snack bar in the"},"629":{"dur":4,"text":"eastern part of the center of\nAmsterdam, which was by then--"},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"I think it's seven\nyears ago, Oof?"},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah."},"637":{"dur":1,"text":"Was then a bit of\na run down area."},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"So we could get the space\nfor quite cheap."},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"And it had a great back space,\nso we could put all our"},"646":{"dur":4,"text":"fridges and all our dishes and\nchina and everything could be"},"650":{"dur":0,"text":"stacked up there."},"651":{"dur":1,"text":"So that was terrific."},"652":{"dur":4,"text":"And we started at the snack bar\nto clean it out, and we"},"656":{"dur":4,"text":"thought we would be open in\nabout six weeks or something."},"661":{"dur":1,"text":"That became six months."},"662":{"dur":3,"text":"So we were doing the whole place\nourselves because we"},"666":{"dur":1,"text":"wanted to save some money."},"667":{"dur":4,"text":"So I think our restaurant was\nreally homemade, too."},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"We had taken off every tile."},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"We had put back every\npiece of platter."},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"We'd been painting everything."},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"And then finally, we\nopened our doors."},"681":{"dur":4,"text":"And we started off as a\nbreakfast and lunch"},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"restaurant, and actually, we\njust wanted to do catering"},"688":{"dur":3,"text":"jobs, and we thought people can\ncome in if they wanted a"},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"sandwich or anything."},"693":{"dur":3,"text":"But it was becoming quite a\nbig business, and we were"},"697":{"dur":1,"text":"having groups in--"},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"people renting the place\nfor special occasions"},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"It was a very small\nrestaurant."},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not huge."},"705":{"dur":6,"text":"So we worked very hard at the\ntime, too, trying to get"},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"everybody in, and also learning\nhow to build up a"},"714":{"dur":3,"text":"restaurant, which is quite a\njob if you have never done"},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"that before."},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"And then something a little\nbit sad happened."},"724":{"dur":4,"text":"I had a sort of medical horrible\nthing with my back"},"729":{"dur":1,"text":"because it's just a hard job."},"730":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean, carrying things around\nfor catering for 20 years is"},"735":{"dur":3,"text":"sort of being like a\nmover or something."},"739":{"dur":3,"text":"So I needed to stop for a\nmoment, and I needed to take"},"742":{"dur":1,"text":"some time off."},"743":{"dur":1,"text":"I was waiting for\nan operation."},"745":{"dur":0,"text":"Boring story."},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"Anyway, I was at home,\nso I needed to do"},"748":{"dur":1,"text":"something with my time."},"750":{"dur":6,"text":"And I thought, well, this is\nthe perfect moment to start"},"756":{"dur":1,"text":"and write a book."},"758":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is actually\nmy third book."},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"But I had two of them\nbefore this."},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I was at home."},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"I was a very fond reader\nof cookbooks."},"769":{"dur":2,"text":"I could read cookbooks\nas novels, actually."},"772":{"dur":2,"text":"I would read them going to\nbed or in the bathtub."},"774":{"dur":4,"text":"Even in the toilet, we have\ncookbooks everywhere piled up."},"778":{"dur":5,"text":"So I was looking at books\nhow I like them."},"784":{"dur":4,"text":"Some books I really enjoyed the\nwriting-- the stories that"},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"the cookbook writers\nwould tell."},"791":{"dur":1,"text":"Some books were really pretty."},"792":{"dur":4,"text":"I loved the pictures in it,\nor the way that they were"},"797":{"dur":3,"text":"illustrated, or all these\nkind of things."},"800":{"dur":3,"text":"So I imagined my own book,\nputting all these things I"},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"loved so much from other books\ntogether in my own head and"},"808":{"dur":4,"text":"tried to express myself\nin my special way."},"813":{"dur":6,"text":"So I had never written a book\nbefore, and I went up to my"},"819":{"dur":4,"text":"publisher, who is my publisher\nnow in Holland, and I asked"},"823":{"dur":4,"text":"him, could I show\nyou my proposal?"},"828":{"dur":2,"text":"I just made a couple of pages."},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"I would like to see if\nyou're interested."},"832":{"dur":3,"text":"So with trembling knees, I\nwent up to his office and"},"836":{"dur":5,"text":"showed him my first example\nof how my book would be."},"842":{"dur":1,"text":"I had made a table\nof contents."},"843":{"dur":2,"text":"I had talked about it a bit."},"846":{"dur":4,"text":"And I had also made some\ndrawings, and I also do the"},"850":{"dur":1,"text":"whole design of the book."},"852":{"dur":0,"text":"So I had done everything."},"853":{"dur":4,"text":"I made the cover, I had done\nsome shots with Oof, and"},"857":{"dur":0,"text":"showed it to him."},"858":{"dur":2,"text":"And he said, yes,\nyou can do it."},"860":{"dur":1,"text":"So I was thrilled to bits."},"861":{"dur":2,"text":"I was actually so happy."},"863":{"dur":4,"text":"I didn't imagine it\nto be so easy."},"867":{"dur":5,"text":"So I went home, and we started\noff on this book."},"872":{"dur":1,"text":"And it was quite a journey."},"874":{"dur":2,"text":"It was called \"Home Made.\"\nIt's my first book."},"876":{"dur":1,"text":"And you will recognize\nit because it has big"},"878":{"dur":1,"text":"tomatoes on the front."},"879":{"dur":2,"text":"It's blue and red."},"881":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's a book about\neverything homemade,"},"884":{"dur":6,"text":"obviously, because I had been\nwriting for so many magazines"},"890":{"dur":3,"text":"for so many years for so many\ngroups of people, like"},"894":{"dur":2,"text":"housewives, or young girls."},"896":{"dur":3,"text":"These magazines all have their\nown groups that they are"},"900":{"dur":4,"text":"So I had to write for all\nthese kinds of people."},"904":{"dur":5,"text":"So I really found out that a\nlot of people were actually"},"910":{"dur":3,"text":"afraid of starting to cook."},"914":{"dur":5,"text":"And also, they would not know\nthat things would be so easy."},"920":{"dur":3,"text":"Like, I grew up, my mom would\nteach me how to make cheese."},"924":{"dur":1,"text":"This was a very easy thing."},"925":{"dur":4,"text":"You would heat up milk, add some\nacid to it, and then it"},"930":{"dur":2,"text":"would curdle, and then you would\nput it in a sieve, and"},"933":{"dur":2,"text":"we would hang it in our tree."},"935":{"dur":2,"text":"We had a lilac tree in the\ngarden that had low branches,"},"938":{"dur":4,"text":"and we would hang it in the\ntree and just wait to soak"},"942":{"dur":1,"text":"out, or what do you call it?"},"944":{"dur":5,"text":"And we would keep a little\ncheese at the end."},"949":{"dur":1,"text":"So that was really great."},"950":{"dur":3,"text":"These things that I thought were\nvery normal to me were"},"954":{"dur":1,"text":"not normal to all\nthese people."},"955":{"dur":1,"text":"So I decided to put this\nall in a book."},"957":{"dur":3,"text":"So how to pickle things, or\nhow to make a smoker oven"},"961":{"dur":6,"text":"without using difficult\nappliances like smoker ovens"},"968":{"dur":3,"text":"or ice makers."},"971":{"dur":4,"text":"Just a knife or a cutting board\nor a piece of tin foil."},"976":{"dur":1,"text":"Just things that you would\nhave lying around."},"978":{"dur":3,"text":"Making cheese without\nusing a rennet."},"981":{"dur":3,"text":"Things that are available\nin the stores."},"985":{"dur":2,"text":"Not very hard, and not too\ndifficult to find."},"987":{"dur":2,"text":"But also, I wanted to make a\nbook that made you turn every"},"990":{"dur":3,"text":"page-- that every picture\nwould be different."},"994":{"dur":3,"text":"That I would make drawings just\nto make it different,"},"997":{"dur":2,"text":"just to make you turn\nthe pages again."},"1000":{"dur":4,"text":"I would make cutouts out of\npaper to design my chapters."},"1004":{"dur":3,"text":"I just made all these things to\ntempt people just to turn"},"1008":{"dur":2,"text":"the next page and read again\nabout everything."},"1011":{"dur":2,"text":"And I tried to make a book that\nwas very personal to me"},"1013":{"dur":3,"text":"because it was my story."},"1017":{"dur":4,"text":"And that really worked out."},"1021":{"dur":3,"text":"We worked on the book for about,\nI think, a year, a year"},"1025":{"dur":1,"text":"and a half."},"1026":{"dur":3,"text":"And then it came out, and we had\nquite a success with it."},"1029":{"dur":3,"text":"I was so surprised because I\ninitially made the book just"},"1033":{"dur":0,"text":"for myself."},"1034":{"dur":4,"text":"I just wanted to have a book--\nto hold it in my hands, and to"},"1038":{"dur":4,"text":"have something that\nI actually made."},"1042":{"dur":5,"text":"And we won prizes with it, and\nwe got published in all"},"1048":{"dur":3,"text":"Not only here in America,\nbut all over the world."},"1052":{"dur":3,"text":"The book got translated in\nGerman, and it got translated"},"1055":{"dur":1,"text":"into French."},"1056":{"dur":4,"text":"So that was really terrific, and\nespecially for just a girl"},"1061":{"dur":2,"text":"coming from Holland teaching\nfriends how to cook."},"1063":{"dur":3,"text":"That was really nice."},"1066":{"dur":3,"text":"So then my publisher asked me,\ncould you make another one?"},"1069":{"dur":2,"text":"Because this one is\ndoing so well."},"1072":{"dur":3,"text":"And we decided not to make\none but make two."},"1076":{"dur":2,"text":"One was called \"Home Made\nWinter,\" and the other one is"},"1078":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Home Made Summer.\" It's the\nbook you are all holding in"},"1081":{"dur":1,"text":"your hands."},"1083":{"dur":4,"text":"It's the same principle I kept\nof teaching people how to make"},"1087":{"dur":4,"text":"simple things like yogurt or\ncheese or all kinds of things."},"1092":{"dur":4,"text":"Mustard or ketchup or all these\nthings yourself, but"},"1096":{"dur":1,"text":"keeping it very seasonal."},"1097":{"dur":4,"text":"So my winter book was more about\nthe winter, and long"},"1102":{"dur":2,"text":"nights, and-- well, you\ndon't have

and"},"1304":{"dur":1,"text":"say, I want to try this."},"1305":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe this will work."},"1307":{"dur":2,"text":"Like, why go towards basil\nversus

available."},"1327":{"dur":2,"text":"But I like to do little\nsurprises."},"1330":{"dur":5,"text":"So like you said, this was a\nvery strange combination."},"1336":{"dur":2,"text":"I actually write these\nrecipes in my head."},"1338":{"dur":4,"text":"So I would first think of them,\nand then I'll try them."},"1342":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'll write them out."},"1343":{"dur":3,"text":"And because I

actually always looking at\nthe very regular palates."},"1359":{"dur":6,"text":"Like, you would use sour to\nbalance out sweetness, or you"},"1365":{"dur":2,"text":"would use saltiness to balance\nout sweetness."},"1368":{"dur":2,"text":"You always have these things\nthat always work."},"1370":{"dur":5,"text":"Like, a very traditional way\nof eating cantaloupe in"},"1375":{"dur":4,"text":"France,

the"},"1386":{"dur":2,"text":"sweetness of the cantaloupe."},"1388":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you think a little bit\nfurther, you could say, well,"},"1392":{"dur":3,"text":"ham is salty, but cheese\ncould also be salty."},"1395":{"dur":1,"text":"So let's try that out."},"1396":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I would add\nbasil just to use"},"1399":{"dur":1,"text":"something really fragrant."},"1401":{"dur":3,"text":"But also, I was thinking of\nthe colors on your plate."},"1404":{"dur":2,"text":"You have an orange soup with\nthese white spots and

happens."},"1413":{"dur":0,"text":"Yeah."},"1414":{"dur":4,"text":"It's funny, but it's always a\nsort of mixture of visual and"},"1418":{"dur":4,"text":"tasting and then trying it out\nat home,

much more\nvegetables than I think our"},"1584":{"dur":1,"text":"parents did."},"1585":{"dur":2,"text":"So I would mix that in\nmuch more, yeah."},"1588":{"dur":4,"text":"AUDIENCE: I was wondering

cooking."},"1664":{"dur":3,"text":"You always have a big pan\nof broth lying around."},"1667":{"dur":4,"text":"You always have super\nmeats and things."},"1672":{"dur":3,"text":"So you always have to

about."},"1698":{"dur":2,"text":"You have to think of\nyour audience."},"1700":{"dur":3,"text":"And if I'm writing a recipe for\npeople living in villages,"},"1703":{"dur":1,"text":"I would never use ingredients\nthat you"},"1705":{"dur":2,"text":"can only buy in cities."},"1708":{"dur":4,"text":"So that is something\nI really look at."},"1712":{"dur":5,"text":"And I could tweak existing\nrecipes

question is, you\nstarted off with one cookbook"},"1766":{"dur":2,"text":"and decided that you were going\nto put some things that"},"1768":{"dur":1,"text":"were really valuable, what\nyou thought were very"},"1770":{"dur":3,"text":"important but easy."},"1773":{"dur":1,"text":"And then you ended up\ngoing to three."},"1774":{"dur":1,"text":"YVETTE VAN BOVEN: Yeah."},"1776":{"dur":0,"text":"AUDIENCE: What happened?"},"1777":{"dur":2,"text":"How did you decide what to put\nin the first one, and then did"},"1779":{"dur":1,"text":"you run out of material and

book."},"1802":{"dur":6,"text":"So I would say the first book\nI was really focused on all"},"1809":{"dur":4,"text":"these different kinds of curing,\nor making cheese, or"},"1813":{"dur":3,"text":"making sweets, or making snacks,\nor making all these."},"1817":{"dur":4,"text":"So I made a real strict\ntable of contents"},"1821":{"dur":2,"text":"to keep myself focused."},"1824":{"dur":2,"text":"Obviously, I had more recipes\nlaying around."},"1827":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm writing, I think, about\n15 to 20 recipes a"},"1831":{"dur":2,"text":"week for all my

almonds,\ngreen seedless grapes,"},"1956":{"dur":4,"text":"cucumber, and some vegetable\nbroth, and I mix it up."},"1960":{"dur":6,"text":"And then I added things like\nvinegar-- just a little bit to"},"1966":{"dur":2,"text":"balance out the sweet\nsour balance--"},"1969":{"dur":2,"text":"and white bread to make\nit nice and soft."},"1971":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you put it in a blender\nand

really"},"1991":{"dur":2,"text":"funny, but it was\nan amazing soup."},"1994":{"dur":1,"text":"I was very happy with that."},"1995":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's also nice because\nit's a two-minute
