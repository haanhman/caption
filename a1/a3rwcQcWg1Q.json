Now it's important to dice\nthe butter. Little pinch of salt and sugar."},"34":{"dur":5,"text":"About a teaspoon full of sugar and always,\na little touch of salt."},"39":{"dur":5,"text":"Now get this on the heat and start this to\ncome to the boil.

Now, two things with this:\nyou're mixing it together to a roux but also"},"60":{"dur":4,"text":"you're mixing it together to a texture that's\nperfect for choux pastry. Keep mixing it at"},"64":{"dur":4,"text":"this point and you can do that and tell when\nit's ready by watching it and it goes into"},"69":{"dur":6,"text":"this thickened roux but also by listening\nto it. When it starts to pop, give this another"},"76":{"dur":7,"text":"20 seconds. Get yourself a tray, tip this\nout on the tray and spread that out. You want"},"84":{"dur":4,"text":"it to cool as quick as possible. Because again,\nlook at all this steam coming off it."},"89":{"dur":4,"text":"The more steam we keep in the choux pastry,\nthe better it's going to be.

You fill it up."},"154":{"dur":4,"text":"And then really piping is all about practice.\nThe more you do it , the better you'll get."},"159":{"dur":4,"text":"But the first thing you do is hold it like\nthis, so you tighten up the bag on the end"},"163":{"dur":5,"text":"and this hand is squeezing the mixture through.\nAll this is doing is directing where the bag"},"168":{"dur":5,"text":"is going.

Just to keep cool."},"288":{"dur":6,"text":"Right, turn my attention now to the fondant\nicing. So icing sugar, water and a bit of"},"295":{"dur":5,"text":"coffee essence really. Good drizzle of that\nin first. Then I use a combination of a whisk"},"301":{"dur":5,"text":"with a spatular. What you start with is just\nplain water. You add a little bit of water"},"307":{"dur":5,"text":"in at a time. Now what you're creating first\nof all is a paste.
