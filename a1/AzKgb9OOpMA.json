that."},"319":{"dur":1,"text":"And we had to learn how\nto use it ourselves,"},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"but we made sure that\nin that process--"},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"Shall I just say, when he\ntalks about what's out there,"},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"in terms of technologies\nand various kind"},"328":{"dur":2,"text":"of interface devices\nthat we could try and use"},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"in a sort of musical\nenvironment in Heart and Soul."},"332":{"dur":1,"text":"A massive long list."},"334":{"dur":0,"text":"Yeah, that was--"},"335":{"dur":3,"text":"It was huge."},"338":{"dur":1,"text":"And so we were trying to\nget through that list,"},"340":{"dur":1,"text":"but work with people\nat the same time"},"342":{"dur":4,"text":"to just sort of find out what\nwas accessible for people."},"346":{"dur":1,"text":"And then once we'd\nsort of collected"},"348":{"dur":3,"text":"a group of technologies that we\nwere comfortable with working,"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"and other people were\ncomfortable with working, just"},"354":{"dur":2,"text":"finding how they work together."},"356":{"dur":5,"text":"So things might stand alone\nas usable and accessible"},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"technology, but they might\nnot interact with other things"},"364":{"dur":1,"text":"And because the\nwhole thing is just"},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"trying to grab a broad\nspectrum of devices"},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"from things that\nare free on an iPad,"},"372":{"dur":7,"text":"to maybe something more\nexpensive, more technology."},"379":{"dur":3,"text":"And then we wanted to\ntry and really push"},"382":{"dur":1,"text":"how accessible they were."},"384":{"dur":4,"text":"So initially we went on the\nroot of creating a framework"},"388":{"dur":4,"text":"that anybody could\ncome up and basically"},"393":{"dur":3,"text":"have an instant music\nmaking experience"},"396":{"dur":1,"text":"in a group with other people."},"398":{"dur":6,"text":"And so we were basically\ncreating this frame"},"404":{"dur":4,"text":"that of any age, any ability,\nany sort of musicality"},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"could come up and\nengage with other people"},"410":{"dur":4,"text":"within a matter of minutes."},"414":{"dur":1,"text":"And to have a meaningful\ngroup experience."},"416":{"dur":1,"text":"And then this\nactually brought up"},"418":{"dur":6,"text":"loads of questions about what\nwe were doing to the people that"},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"participating, and\nwe're essentially"},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"creating passive\nparticipants that"},"429":{"dur":3,"text":"were using what we were\ngiving them to make music."},"433":{"dur":3,"text":"And we were kind of the\nactive part of the process."},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"And so right now we're\nat the point where"},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"we're trying to\nreverse that, and we're"},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"trying to make active\nparticipants who"},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"have more ownership over the\nmusic that they're making."},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"So they're the ones\ncreating the sounds,"},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"they're the ones--\nthey're making"},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"more of the decisions\naround what they're actually"},"454":{"dur":1,"text":"working with."},"455":{"dur":3,"text":"And we're being the passive\nsort of facilitators,"},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"and essentially trying to be\ninvolved as little as possible."},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"It's just kind of interesting,\nbecause in R&D, you"},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"can, if you're a\nparticipant, feel"},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"like someone's doing an\nexperiment on you all the time."},"468":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think there was a real\nmoment where we just listening"},"472":{"dur":1,"text":"to what people were telling us."},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's actually\nno, we got to change"},"476":{"dur":1,"text":"the way we're doing this."},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's been really\nsignificant, but fantastic"},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"actually."},"481":{"dur":1,"text":"Three minutes left."},"483":{"dur":1,"text":"That's the first question."},"484":{"dur":1,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"489":{"dur":4,"text":"So how do we make the\nmost of the-- yeah."},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"In a way actually, how\ndo we make most of it?"},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"We've all actually worked\ntogether beforehand anyway."},"499":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, I've obviously known\nMarc for quite a long time."},"502":{"dur":7,"text":"And actually when I left the\ngames industry in 2010-- sorry."},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"When I left the games\nindustry in 2010,"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"the first thing I did was work\nwith Mark on a project, which"},"515":{"dur":1,"text":"was at the Royal\nFestival Hall, then"},"517":{"dur":3,"text":"went to Lincoln Centre, which\nwas a big live, interactive 3D"},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"show with performers."},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"So we actually had\nexperience working"},"524":{"dur":1,"text":"together before, and\nthen that led to Mark"},"526":{"dur":1,"text":"working with Goldsmiths."},"527":{"dur":4,"text":"Yeah, we did with Goldsmiths\nactually Sue, who's over there,"},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"was another of the\nunlimited artists who"},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"was commissioned in 2012."},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"We had the Dean Rodney\nSingers project,"},"538":{"dur":5,"text":"which was-- we found basically\n72 people from seven countries"},"543":{"dur":1,"text":"across the world\nwho came together"},"545":{"dur":3,"text":"to create 23 new pieces\nof music, which was shared"},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"in an installation\nat the South Bank,"},"550":{"dur":3,"text":"which Goldsmiths helped\ncreate a psychedelic arcade."},"553":{"dur":1,"text":"And then we made\ntwo apps with them."},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's been our\njourney so far."},"557":{"dur":5,"text":"And then also the importance\nof not only ensuring"},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"the tech work, but then also\nthat it worked with people"},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"and discovering what the\nvalue of that technology"},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"was to people that\nwe're working with."},"572":{"dur":4,"text":"Yeah, I think that's actually\nkey from the technology side,"},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"is actually just instead of\nlooking at the technology"},"578":{"dur":3,"text":"as like-- because you can\nget excited about tech stuff,"},"581":{"dur":4,"text":"and making something cool, but\nthe idea that actually it's"},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"just really\nfacilitated for people"},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"making and performing\nmusic ultimately"},"590":{"dur":1,"text":"became the main thing."},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that really guided it."},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"The technology for us is\njust about another means"},"597":{"dur":1,"text":"of people being able\nto express themselves."},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"That's what it's all been about."},"601":{"dur":0,"text":"One minute left."},"602":{"dur":1,"text":"We can do this."},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"I think I know the\nanswer to that."},"607":{"dur":1,"text":"How did we work\nwith participants"},"609":{"dur":1,"text":"to develop our understanding?"},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"I think the most\nimportant thing was"},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"that from the very\nfirst through meeting,"},"615":{"dur":4,"text":"there were-- the participants\nwere involved in table"},"619":{"dur":1,"text":"[INAUDIBLE],\neverything we do and"},"620":{"dur":3,"text":"throughout the whole process\nwe haven't

one."},"634":{"dur":1,"text":"Very interesting."},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"Talking to technology companies,\nand explaining the project"},"638":{"dur":4,"text":"has just meant that people\nhave given us loads of stuff."},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"And it means we're just kind of\nconstantly getting new stuff."},"646":{"dur":3,"text":"Alpha spheres, Moog\nthereminis, little bits."},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"It's been fantastic."},"651":{"dur":3,"text":"So just again, clear\nexplanation of a project."},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a good thing\npeople want

with\nthe idea that-- oh yeah, OK."},"678":{"dur":1,"text":"Probably short amount of time."},"679":{"dur":1,"text":"That we wanted to\ntry and find a way"},"681":{"dur":4,"text":"to interface with off-the-shelf\ndevices, including smartphones,"},"685":{"dur":2,"text":"maybe Kinect controllers,\ngame controllers."},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"Anything that people\ncan buy that's"},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"not exactly a huge\namount of outlay,"},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"and try and use those\nin a musical context."},"695":{"dur":3,"text":"So we wrote, effectively,\na code framework"},"698":{"dur":4,"text":"to try and address all of those\ndevices in a very generic way."},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"And we did actually plug in\na bit of machine learning"},"705":{"dur":1,"text":"as well, which you were\nmentioning earlier on"},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"to try and address\nthe data space"},"709":{"dur":3,"text":"that some of those instruments\nare kind of passing through."},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"And at the moment-- because\nwe've still got a few minutes"},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"left-- but we really\ncoalesced on final output,"},"718":{"dur":3,"text":"which is Ableton Live, which is\nthe main programme that's Heart"},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"and Soul are using to produce\nand perform music with."},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're just\ncoming to the point"},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"now we have an app-- well,\nit's not really an app,"},"729":{"dur":1,"text":"in terms of a smartphone app."},"730":{"dur":1,"text":"It runs on Mac at the moment."},"732":{"dur":4,"text":"But it's a way to\neffectively forms"},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"a bridge between Ableton and all\nthe devices that we're using."},"739":{"dur":3,"text":"So we can read the information\nthat Ableton-- when people put"},"743":{"dur":0,"text":"tracks in."},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"And then expose\nthose to the devices"},"746":{"dur":1,"text":"that were through\nthe code framework,"},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"in a kind of very simple\ndrag and drop manner."},"751":{"dur":4,"text":"That's the current phase\nof things, I guess."},"755":{"dur":1,"text":"Does that answer the question?"},"757":{"dur":1,"text":"Essence of the\ntechnology challenge."},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"We're still learning,\nsince we haven't finished."},"769":{"dur":5,"text":"Just in more terms\nof like things"},"774":{"dur":4,"text":"we learned about just the\nactual technologies, just things"},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"like the player needs to\nknow what they're doing"},"781":{"dur":1,"text":"and what the system is doing."},"782":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's just about\nfeedback from the objects,"},"786":{"dur":4,"text":"the technology, and kind\nof like really ensuring"},"790":{"dur":1,"text":"that the natural\nmapping of things"},"792":{"dur":5,"text":"works so there isn't a\ndisconnect between the

a sort of\ncentral control hub,"},"808":{"dur":2,"text":"and I think that's\nkind of important."},"810":{"dur":1,"text":"Because we found\nwith Ableton, it's"},"812":{"dur":1,"text":"quite a sophisticated\npiece of software."},"814":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's not necessarily\nthe sort of thing"},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"which people with\nlearning disabilities"},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"are
