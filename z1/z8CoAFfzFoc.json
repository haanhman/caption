biodiversity \n and conservation biology."},"36":{"dur":3,"text":"Dr. Anthony Barnosky, \n of the University of California,"},"40":{"dur":4,"text":"Berkley; Dr. Elizabeth Hadly, \n of Stanford University;"},"45":{"dur":2,"text":"and Dr. Stephen Palumbi,"},"47":{"dur":2,"text":"also of Stanford University."},"51":{"dur":5,"text":"The fifth lecture is titled \"Ocean \n Species Respond to Climate Change.\""},"57":{"dur":2,"text":"And now, Dr. Stephen Palumbi."},"59":{"dur":6,"text":"[applause]"},"65":{"dur":1,"text":"[PALUMBI:] Welcome back."},"67":{"dur":1,"text":"Thanks for coming back."},"68":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm going to talk \n about climate change in the oceans."},"71":{"dur":4,"text":"And when we think about climate change \n it's a global issue."},"76":{"dur":2,"text":"Liz and Tony have talked \n a lot about it a lot,"},"78":{"dur":3,"text":"and there's features of climate change \n in the ocean and on land"},"82":{"dur":1,"text":"that are pretty much the same,"},"83":{"dur":3,"text":"particularly at the borders of the ocean \n and the land where rising sea level"},"86":{"dur":5,"text":"and increased storms increasingly \n mean that our coastlines are pummeled"},"92":{"dur":7,"text":"by waves and the destruction \n of large storms like Hurricane Sandy."},"99":{"dur":4,"text":"And that is something \n that we can understand from both sides,"},"103":{"dur":1,"text":"the terrestrial and the ocean side."},"105":{"dur":1,"text":"Well there are a couple things \n about climate change"},"107":{"dur":2,"text":"that are really different in the ocean."},"109":{"dur":4,"text":"And probably the most \n important one is ocean acidification."},"114":{"dur":3,"text":"Now ocean acidification comes about \n because as we pump CO2"},"117":{"dur":1,"text":"into the atmosphere,"},"119":{"dur":4,"text":"then that dissolves back into the ocean \n and makes carbonic acid."},"124":{"dur":5,"text":"That carbonic acid increases the acidity \n of the ocean and affects marine life."},"129":{"dur":4,"text":"Now I've just dropped here \n a piece of coral in vinegar."},"133":{"dur":4,"text":"Now vinegar is 100,000 times \n more acidic than the ocean"},"138":{"dur":4,"text":"will ever be and these corals \n are bubbling because the acid"},"142":{"dur":3,"text":"and the calcium carbonate \n are interacting to release CO2."},"146":{"dur":3,"text":"That is not going to happen \n in the future oceans"},"149":{"dur":1,"text":"because this is vinegar,"},"151":{"dur":1,"text":"but the principle is the same."},"153":{"dur":2,"text":"That, as the acidity \n of the ocean goes up,"},"155":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's increased 26% \n over the last couple decades,"},"158":{"dur":2,"text":"those shells--the skeletons of corals,"},"161":{"dur":5,"text":"the shells of gastropods--are harder \n to make and easier to dissolve."},"167":{"dur":4,"text":"And so that changes the way \n ocean life lives and our entire ocean."},"171":{"dur":4,"text":"Now I mentioned in the last lecture \n that it's the biggest biological habitat"},"176":{"dur":4,"text":"known in the universe \n and we're changing its basic chemistry."},"180":{"dur":2,"text":"Not only are shells harder to make,"},"182":{"dur":3,"text":"but actually nervous systems \n are harder to work."},"186":{"dur":2,"text":"Some really interesting research \n out of Australia"},"189":{"dur":4,"text":"has shown that when fish are subjected \n to very high levels of CO2 in the water,"},"194":{"dur":3,"text":"it changes the pH and it changes the way \n their nervous systems function."},"197":{"dur":3,"text":"They no longer evaluate the risk \n of predators correctly"},"201":{"dur":6,"text":"and so they leave themselves out to \n predation risk to a much higher degree."},"207":{"dur":3,"text":"Their growth rate suffers, \n the growth rate of many marine species"},"210":{"dur":5,"text":"suffer when acidification becomes \n more and more and more of a problem."},"217":{"dur":3,"text":"The other major threat, \n the fourth major threat"},"220":{"dur":2,"text":"of climate change \n in the oceans is warming."},"222":{"dur":3,"text":"Similar to on land, \n but what I'm going to talk to you"},"226":{"dur":2,"text":"about is how that affects \n particular ocean species."},"229":{"dur":3,"text":"This is a map \n from earlier this month of the Pacific."},"232":{"dur":3,"text":"Now the red and the dark red colors \n are areas of the Pacific"},"235":{"dur":3,"text":"that are a degree or two warmer \n than expected for this time of year,"},"239":{"dur":1,"text":"temperature anomalies."},"241":{"dur":3,"text":"Now those areas \n are washing across the Pacific."},"245":{"dur":3,"text":"About a week \n ago I was on the big island of Hawaii,"},"248":{"dur":2,"text":"which is that little spot \n right down there,"},"250":{"dur":3,"text":"and what we were seeing \n there was coral bleaching,"},"254":{"dur":4,"text":"that is we were seeing the reaction \n of corals to this warm water"},"258":{"dur":3,"text":"in ways that are very detrimental \n to the reefs themselves."},"262":{"dur":3,"text":"So we've got good satellite maps \n of what's happening out there"},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"in terms of the temperature of the ocean"},"267":{"dur":1,"text":"and what I'm going to talk to you a bit"},"269":{"dur":4,"text":"about is how species \n respond to that and then what we"},"273":{"dur":5,"text":"know about how they might actually \n survive it or not in the future."},"278":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to talk to you \n a lot about corals"},"280":{"dur":4,"text":"and I'm going to talk to you \n about how they interact with the climate"},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'm going to sort of present them \n in at first a little bit"},"288":{"dur":1,"text":"of a sort of paleontological way,"},"290":{"dur":1,"text":"like Tony said,"},"292":{"dur":6,"text":"because in a lot of ways corals \n have been major survivors in our planet."},"298":{"dur":5,"text":"They were born as a group of organisms \n about 250 million years ago."},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"They have survived two mass extinctions,"},"307":{"dur":4,"text":"they have been major players \n of the oceans of the planet"},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"for most of that 250 million years."},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"So from that standpoint \n they seem like survivors,"},"317":{"dur":1,"text":"they're good at mass extinctions,"},"319":{"dur":1,"text":"they're good at all kinds \n of environmental change,"},"321":{"dur":3,"text":"but when we turn around we \n see that in fact a lot of the things"},"325":{"dur":4,"text":"that we do on our planet \n right now seem to be killing them."},"331":{"dur":4,"text":"Loss of coral cover over the last couple \n of decades is up to about 40%,"},"336":{"dur":3,"text":"and that's because of sedimentation \n kills corals, pollution kills corals,"},"340":{"dur":3,"text":"overfishing kills corals because algae \n grew up all over the corals,"},"344":{"dur":4,"text":"acidification slows down their growth \n and the temperature of the water"},"349":{"dur":4,"text":"when it goes up causes corals \n to bleach and die."},"353":{"dur":1,"text":"So here's the conundrum, \n they're survivors,"},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"they live through a quarter \n of a billion years,"},"358":{"dur":3,"text":"and they're dying now every time \n we do something."},"361":{"dur":5,"text":"What is that? How can they be so strong \n and so wimpy at the same time?"},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"Well you can boil that \n down into a couple"},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"of different hypotheses \n about what might be going on,"},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"and here's two \n that seem to be the strong ones."},"373":{"dur":3,"text":"Maybe, even though they've lived \n a quarter of a billion years,"},"377":{"dur":3,"text":"what we're doing on the planet \n now is on an unprecedented scale"},"380":{"dur":3,"text":"and rate of environmental change, \n they just cannot handle."},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"Or maybe corals \n have really unknown abilities"},"387":{"dur":3,"text":"to survive and deal \n with strong environmental change"},"391":{"dur":4,"text":"that we don't know about yet \n that they've used to survive cataclysm's"},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"even though right now we \n see their numbers dropping."},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm going to go through these two \n and look at them."},"400":{"dur":1,"text":"It turns out they're both true."},"402":{"dur":4,"text":"And the fact that it's \n such an unprecedented rate of change"},"406":{"dur":3,"text":"is really directed our research \n over the last 10 years"},"410":{"dur":3,"text":"to look for how corals are reacting."},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"The example that we're going to use \n is the rate of change,"},"415":{"dur":1,"text":"Tony talked about the rate of extinction"},"417":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'm going to talk about the rate \n of temperature change."},"420":{"dur":5,"text":"What's shown here on the left-hand side \n is the last 150,000 years."},"426":{"dur":4,"text":"In particular I want you to focus \n on the last 20,000 years ago or so."},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the recovery \n from a major ice age,"},"433":{"dur":5,"text":"the temperatures in the world \n increased by about 7 degrees Centigrade,"},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"so what's the rate \n of temperature increase"},"440":{"dur":3,"text":"in this really strong recovery \n from an ice age?"},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"We draw the line, \n 7 degrees over 10,000 years is"},"446":{"dur":4,"text":".07 degrees Centigrade per century."},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"How does that compare \n with the increase in temperature"},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"that we're seeing now in the world?"},"456":{"dur":1,"text":"That's the right-hand graph"},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"that's the increase \n in global average temperatures"},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"in the oceans over the last 100 years \n or so."},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"We draw the same kind of line and it's"},"465":{"dur":1,"text":".8 degrees in a century."},"467":{"dur":4,"text":"That's 11 times higher than that,"},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"which means \n that as we are changing the world,"},"474":{"dur":1,"text":"not only are we \n increasing the temperature,"},"475":{"dur":6,"text":"but we're doing it at 11 times the rate \n that occurred even if we pick one"},"482":{"dur":4,"text":"of the biggest changes of temperature \n in the recent history of life."},"486":{"dur":3,"text":"So we are having a really big impact \n on the world."},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"It may be unprecedented."},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"And let's go to the next question"},"494":{"dur":6,"text":"and say well okay how do corals \n then react when these changes happen?"},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"I've mentioned bleaching a couple \n of times. What is that?"},"504":{"dur":4,"text":"A coral animal is a skeleton \n with a tissue layer on top of it."},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"The tissue layer \n is generally tan or brown,"},"513":{"dur":1,"text":"but it's not because of the coral."},"515":{"dur":4,"text":"It's tan or brown because corals \n have an internal cellular symbiont,"},"520":{"dur":3,"text":"an dinoflagellate alga \n called Symbiodinium,"},"523":{"dur":5,"text":"and heating causes the Symbiodinium \n to be expelled from the corals"},"528":{"dur":5,"text":"and what you see \n is the transparent tissue of the coral"},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"with the white skeleton underneath,"},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"that's coral bleaching."},"537":{"dur":5,"text":"Well it turns out that understanding \n that involves an incredible integration"},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"of remote sensing in the world,"},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"ecology,"},"547":{"dur":1,"text":"the cell biology of corals,"},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"even the molecular biology \n of photosynthesis."},"551":{"dur":4,"text":"And what I want to do \n is take you on a little tour of that now"},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"just to see how this works."},"558":{"dur":1,"text":"Now corals are small animals,"},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"but they build structure \n that you could actually see from space."},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"And as we zoom in we see the reefs \n where I work on a little island"},"567":{"dur":5,"text":"called Ofu in America Samoa, the ridge \n there, the edge is the coral reef"},"572":{"dur":3,"text":"and as we zoom in we \n see what those reefs are."},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"Now the reefs are made \n of individual coral colonies"},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"like we see now."},"581":{"dur":4,"text":"That coral then is actually made up \n of a whole series"},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"of small polyps they're called."},"587":{"dur":1,"text":"This is a colonial organism,"},"590":{"dur":4,"text":"and the polyps themselves have \n all the structures that an animal needs."},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"It has a mouth, it has tentacles, \n it has gonads, it can live,"},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"it can reproduce, it can grow."},"599":{"dur":4,"text":"They're in a colony \n of genetically identical polyps."},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"Now the color on these tentacles, \n like I said,"},"606":{"dur":1,"text":"is not the color of the coral itself,"},"608":{"dur":1,"text":"it's the color of the symbiont,"},"610":{"dur":3,"text":"and as the focus racks \n in and out a little bit here,"},"613":{"dur":6,"text":"then what we see is that we can just see \n the little globules of the symbiont."},"620":{"dur":1,"text":"Well let's take a closer look."},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"We'll go into a tentacle and see those."},"624":{"dur":3,"text":"These cells, the symbionts, \n are not just floating around,"},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"they're actually inside the coral cells."},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"Corals are simple, \n they just have two cells layers:"},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"an epidermis and a gastrodermis inside."},"634":{"dur":3,"text":"The symbionts \n are inside the gastrodermis,"},"638":{"dur":1,"text":"and you can see it there."},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"Now this is a life form \n called a dinoflagellate."},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"It has chloroplasts \n because it's photosynthetic,"},"644":{"dur":4,"text":"but it has very odd-shaped chloroplasts \n like these yellow structures here."},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"We're going to zoom \n in to the chloroplast itself"},"652":{"dur":4,"text":"because that's where the damage \n happens during bleaching."},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"What do chloroplasts have in them?"},"657":{"dur":3,"text":"They have membranes \n called thylakoid membranes."},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"Those membranes hold the proteins \n called the photosystems"},"664":{"dur":4,"text":"that then capture light energy \n and turn it into chemical energy."},"668":{"dur":3,"text":"It's the molecules \n that capture all of the sunlight"},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"that we get on the planet \n to make the food that we eat."},"674":{"dur":3,"text":"The rain of photons \n down here hits these photosystems"},"677":{"dur":1,"text":"and they gather them up."},"679":{"dur":4,"text":"Now if the temperature goes up \n and if the light goes up,"},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"then they freak out."},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"There's too much energy, \n the photosystems break"},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"and they no longer \n can function the way they do,"},"692":{"dur":4,"text":"but the rain of photon \n keeps going, the energy is still there,"},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"and as a consequence"},"697":{"dur":4,"text":"that energy is now turned \n into making reactive oxygen molecules"},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"Those are damaging to cells, so \n it damages the inside of the symbiont,"},"706":{"dur":4,"text":"it damages the inside of the coral cell \n and they spit the symbiont out."},"711":{"dur":3,"text":"That spitting of the symbiont \n out by one coral cell isn't bad,"},"714":{"dur":4,"text":"but if the entire colony does it, \n then that's coral bleaching."},"719":{"dur":3,"text":"What you can see here \n is simulated of the spitting"},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"out of these symbionts \n and the gradual whitening"},"725":{"dur":4,"text":"of this particular part \n of this particular coral colony."},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"Well when that happens \n across an entire colony,"},"732":{"dur":3,"text":"then the coral turns \n from its normal tan color"},"736":{"dur":1,"text":"into a white color."},"737":{"dur":1,"text":"What difference does that make?"},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"The symbiont provides 75-80% \n of the energy the coral needs"},"742":{"dur":1,"text":"to survive and without that energy,"},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"it can't make a skeleton \n and it can't live very long."},"747":{"dur":4,"text":"So as a consequence a lot of the corals \n that bleach eventually die,"},"751":{"dur":5,"text":"then that destroys the reef \n in a very severe bleaching event,"},"756":{"dur":5,"text":"then many corals on a reef will succumb \n and take decades to recover."},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"Well we were interested in this process,"},"765":{"dur":1,"text":"we were interested in how corals"},"766":{"dur":3,"text":"might actually not just \n be affected by this,"},"770":{"dur":5,"text":"but also how we might work \n with different systems"},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"to try to find out what corals can do \n to circumvent some of these problems,"},"779":{"dur":3,"text":"or that anything \n they could do to survive better"},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"in the case of bleaching conditions."},"784":{"dur":1,"text":"We found a place to do that,"},"786":{"dur":3,"text":"which is in Ofu Island, \n in American Samoa,"},"790":{"dur":3,"text":"because it's one \n of the best laboratories"},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"for coral science \n that we've been able to find."},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"[PALUMBI (in video):] Ofu Island \n and the lagoon behind the reef"},"799":{"dur":3,"text":"here is one of the best coral \n laboratories in the world."},"802":{"dur":3,"text":"Because the best low tides \n are often during the middle of the day,"},"805":{"dur":1,"text":"these back reef lagoons"},"807":{"dur":3,"text":"heat up to an extraordinary degree \n for a coral reef."},"810":{"dur":5,"text":"They heat up to 32, 33, 34\u00b0 centigrade."},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"That's above the temperature"},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"in which most corals \n will bleach and die,"},"820":{"dur":4,"text":"yet these lagoons \n are full of thriving, growing corals"},"825":{"dur":1,"text":"of many, many species."},"826":{"dur":2,"text":"So the question \n is how do these corals do it?"},"829":{"dur":2,"text":"How do they live \n in such warm temperatures?"},"831":{"dur":4,"text":"Because the theory is \n those temperatures should kill corals."},"836":{"dur":1,"text":"[PALUMBI:] So how do we do that,"},"838":{"dur":6,"text":"how do we work with the corals \n in places like American Samoa"},"845":{"dur":4,"text":"to try to understand how they're related \n to bleaching and heat resistance?"},"849":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is the lab \n that we've built in America Samoa."},"853":{"dur":1,"text":"It may not look like much,"},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"but it's actually \n an incredibly important facility for us"},"858":{"dur":4,"text":"because we've been able \n to standardize the heat stress"},"862":{"dur":1,"text":"that we can apply to corals."},"863":{"dur":3,"text":"We can provide them with a mimic \n of the kinds of heat"},"867":{"dur":2,"text":"they'll get actually \n on an Ofu coral reef"},"870":{"dur":1,"text":"and see how they react."},"871":{"dur":3,"text":"So these tanks actually have heaters \n and chillers in them, they have lights,"},"874":{"dur":1,"text":"they have flow-through water system,"},"876":{"dur":2,"text":"they're controlled by that laptop \n on the right-hand side,"},"878":{"dur":2,"text":"and we can use those little tanks"},"881":{"dur":4,"text":"to mimic what these corals will see \n during a very strong bleaching day"},"886":{"dur":2,"text":"out there in Ofu."},"888":{"dur":2,"text":"What do we see? We see this."},"891":{"dur":3,"text":"We see corals that come out \n of the same tank looking very different."},"894":{"dur":3,"text":"The coral on your left is bleached."},"898":{"dur":3,"text":"It's lost most of its symbionts."},"901":{"dur":2,"text":"The coral on the right \n though is not bleached."},"903":{"dur":1,"text":"It came out of the same tank,"},"904":{"dur":2,"text":"it got the same heat, \n it's the same species."},"907":{"dur":1,"text":"The only difference is that,"},"908":{"dur":3,"text":"the coral on your left was living \n in a very cool part of the reef,"},"912":{"dur":2,"text":"but the coral \n on the right, same species,"},"914":{"dur":2,"text":"was living in a warmer part of the reef."},"916":{"dur":3,"text":"So we know from this \n that different corals react differently"},"919":{"dur":1,"text":"to the same bleaching temperatures."},"921":{"dur":2,"text":"Some bleach like they're predicted to,"},"924":{"dur":2,"text":"but some are resistant to that."},"926":{"dur":2,"text":"So the question that we really \n began to ask is how do they do that?"},"929":{"dur":3,"text":"How do corals \n become resistant to bleaching?"},"933":{"dur":1,"text":"Does it happen quickly?"},"934":{"dur":1,"text":"Can all corals do that?"},"936":{"dur":4,"text":"That's why Ofu has been a really \n important research site for this."},"940":{"dur":1,"text":"How would you find that out?"},"941":{"dur":3,"text":"Well the way we approached \n that was by transplanting them."},"945":{"dur":4,"text":"Corals are really \n effectively great experimental animals"},"949":{"dur":1,"text":"because you can break them"},"951":{"dur":2,"text":"and you can transplant them \n to different parts of the reef."},"953":{"dur":2,"text":"These are just some corals that have \n been living on a different part"},"956":{"dur":3,"text":"of the reef for about two, three years."},"959":{"dur":2,"text":"The numbers there is the number \n of the colony."},"962":{"dur":3,"text":"We know where it's from, \n we can transplant them."},"965":{"dur":3,"text":"So the way this experiment works is \n that well we find a coral on the reef,"},"969":{"dur":2,"text":"we number it \n and tag it and measure its temperature,"},"971":{"dur":2,"text":"we take it, break it in two,"},"974":{"dur":3,"text":"and then we transfer one part \n to the warmer part of the reef."},"977":{"dur":3,"text":"We transfer the other part \n to a cooler pool in the same reef,"},"981":{"dur":2,"text":"let them grow for a couple \n of years, monitor them,"},"983":{"dur":2,"text":"take pictures of them, \n keep track of how they're doing,"},"986":{"dur":4,"text":"and then we put them \n back in the coral stress tank."},"992":{"dur":2,"text":"We then look to see for the same coral"},"994":{"dur":2,"text":"that has been living for a couple years \n in different environments"},"997":{"dur":2,"text":"how that affects \n their bleaching resistance."},"999":{"dur":6,"text":"And this graph here shows that the coral \n in this one colony named colony AH02"},"1005":{"dur":2,"text":"that was living in the warmer pool,"},"1008":{"dur":3,"text":"that colony has a much higher resistance \n to bleaching"},"1011":{"dur":3,"text":"than the exact same genetic colony"},"1014":{"dur":2,"text":"that was living for two years \n in the cooler pool."},"1016":{"dur":3,"text":"That's the blue bar there. \n We can do that a lot."},"1020":{"dur":2,"text":"These are all different colonies \n of the same species"},"1022":{"dur":1,"text":"from different parts of the reef,"},"1023":{"dur":2,"text":"and every time we move them \n into the warmer pool"},"1026":{"dur":1,"text":"they gain heat resistance,"},"1027":{"dur":2,"text":"and every time we \n move them to the cooler pool"},"1029":{"dur":1,"text":"they lose heat resistance."},"1031":{"dur":4,"text":"It means that in fact they can acquire \n this trait, heat resistance,"},"1035":{"dur":1,"text":"at least to some extent."},"1038":{"dur":1,"text":"Well what is that called?"},"1039":{"dur":1,"text":"That's actually called acclimation."},"1041":{"dur":4,"text":"So two responses \n to changing environments"},"1046":{"dur":3,"text":"that most organisms \n and populations have are acclimation."},"1049":{"dur":4,"text":"That's the adjustment of an individual's \n physiology to new conditions."},"1054":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, we can do that."},"1055":{"dur":3,"text":"For example Liz was telling you \n that if you move to Denver"},"1058":{"dur":1,"text":"you'd have 83%"},"1060":{"dur":3,"text":"of the oxygen available to you \n than if you lived at sea level."},"1063":{"dur":2,"text":"And if we do that not only \n would we breathe a little heavily,"},"1066":{"dur":3,"text":"but we'll start making more hemoglobin \n in our red blood cells."},"1069":{"dur":3,"text":"That's an acclimation to high elevation."},"1072":{"dur":4,"text":"Well the reaction that corals \n have to temperature is an
