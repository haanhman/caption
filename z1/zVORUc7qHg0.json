I think, the older I got, I quickly realized\nthat, my parents didn't have a problem with"},"570":{"dur":5,"text":"me being an actor.

Em, yeah, parents are a funny thing.\nEm, they they just want the best for you I"},"614":{"dur":3,"text":"guess, bt yeah.\nSo the question of influences is really important"},"618":{"dur":6,"text":"isn't it. Because you are talking about influences\nthat are quite universal in your own career"},"625":{"dur":8,"text":"now as opposed to quite community ethnic,\nyou know, that that sort of influence. So,"},"633":{"dur":6,"text":"do you still have an association through your\nwork, with the South Asian community. Like"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"for example, this play that you are working\non."},"642":{"dur":4,"text":"Yes. Well ay the moment, we are working on\na play based on the South Asian gay community"},"647":{"dur":4,"text":"and we're asking a question of what is their\nvoice and how can we, how can we hear their"},"652":{"dur":8,"text":"voice. For me, it doesn't matter what the\nwhat the identity of the company is. What"},"660":{"dur":7,"text":"matters to me is the content. So you could\nsay that I've done four projects which was"},"668":{"dur":6,"text":"classify as South Asian. Er one of them was\npretty much after the 7\/7 bombings with Rasa"},"674":{"dur":8,"text":"and we worked on a production where about\na young, a family, a family who encounter"},"683":{"dur":7,"text":"a, whose youngest son, whose oldest son is\na, an Imam, and the youngest son is caught"},"690":{"dur":5,"text":"up in this radical, the radical views. It's\nan interesting story because it tells the"},"696":{"dur":6,"text":"story of the family, em, and where they are,\nat that state in time when we face the 7\/7"},"703":{"dur":6,"text":"bombings. The second project I worked on was\nwith Many Younis, em, was about a young boy"},"709":{"dur":6,"text":"dying in police custody and what affect that\nhas on the family. And also the fact that,"},"715":{"dur":5,"text":"at the time, not not a single policeman had\nbeen convicted of death death in custody since"},"721":{"dur":8,"text":"the 60s. That was for me a fascinating subject.\nThe 7\/7 was a fascinating subject. Em, I worked"},"729":{"dur":5,"text":"with Kali, er, on Tagore's women, and for\nme, Tagore's women is a fascinating subject,"},"735":{"dur":9,"text":"Er, well Tagore is a, I mean, he is someone\nwe all admire, er, from South Asian community,"},"744":{"dur":5,"text":"because he was ahead of his time. He was the\none that advocated women's rights and voices."},"750":{"dur":6,"text":"He, he was a lothario wasn't he slept with\nmany women. He wrote beautiful poetry. He"},"757":{"dur":6,"text":"was well educated. He didn't come from a,\nfrom a hard background. He was, he came from"},"763":{"dur":9,"text":"an affluent background. But still a magical\nman. Em, yeah. This, and of course this project"},"773":{"dur":7,"text":"which is again voicing the voices which we\ndon't really hear in South Asian communities."},"780":{"dur":8,"text":"And so for me it's not about the, the, where\nthe company is from. It's more about the project"},"789":{"dur":7,"text":"that we do. In ten years, it must say a lot\nfor a young performer, whose only done four"},"796":{"dur":7,"text":"projects, er, with what we identify as South\nAsian theatre companies. Because, yeah, because"},"804":{"dur":7,"text":"I don't feel I can identify with them. What\nI can identify with is the content. The project,"},"811":{"dur":6,"text":"the project's content. Like the 7\/7 bombings\nin my beautiful city. Like someone dying in"},"817":{"dur":6,"text":"police custody and no one being responsible\nfor it and how that affects a family. Em,"},"824":{"dur":5,"text":"Tagore, someone that you grow up with admiring,\nand the gay community, which doesn't have"},"830":{"dur":6,"text":"a voice in our own what we describe as South\nAsian community. So those are interesting"},"836":{"dur":6,"text":"subjects for me.\nAnd em, would you consider that the em, label"},"842":{"dur":5,"text":"like South Asian theatre is useful or not\nuseful?"},"847":{"dur":4,"text":"I think, do you know, I was thinking about\nthis, and I've been thinking about this for"},"852":{"dur":6,"text":"a long time, and I think for me, as time's\ngone on, I've, to begin with, I'd never accepted"},"858":{"dur":5,"text":"it. I hated it. I hated the, the notion of\nit. Because it pigeon holes you. It turns"},"864":{"dur":7,"text":"you into something you may not be.

You're you're judging someone and their"},"883":{"dur":7,"text":"experiences based on the colour of your skin.\nAnd I don't identify with those stories that"},"891":{"dur":7,"text":"are told in those South Asian communities.\nI had a very different upbringing. Em, we"},"898":{"dur":6,"text":"were very family orientatated. We were very\nclose, you know. We we grew up in Whitechapel."},"905":{"dur":5,"text":"We had dogs. We, we lived above a shop, you\nknow. So in some ways you could say it's a"},"910":{"dur":7,"text":"typical existence, but fundamentally, we're\nhuman beings aren't we.

Their their constant, I just have"},"935":{"dur":9,"text":"a human story. I don't have an ethnic story.\nI I find that hard to comprehend because,"},"945":{"dur":6,"text":"by labeling, what we do is we stop are society\nfrom moving on. We we, we stop ourselves from"},"952":{"dur":7,"text":"evolving. Em, em and that's what I love about\nLondon. It's a community. It's, when the 7\/7"},"960":{"dur":4,"text":"bombings happened, we as a community rallied\ntogether and it was, it was a magnificent"},"964":{"dur":5,"text":"sight. I can't stop looking outside your window\n'cause it's my city. It's the noises that"},"970":{"dur":6,"text":"I love, and, so it reminds me, yeah. I don't\nthink it is helpful."},"976":{"dur":7,"text":"So, do you think there's a kind of transnationalism\nthat actually informs your identity."},"984":{"dur":6,"text":"Yeah, of course. You can't.

I'm I'm I'm happy to say that.\nAnd it's something we talk we talk about in"},"1007":{"dur":5,"text":"the play at the moment. And I don't think\nthere's anything wrong with being a coconut,"},"1012":{"dur":8,"text":"because actually, what you're open to, is\ncultures.
