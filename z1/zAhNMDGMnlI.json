distance\nthat most astronomers use."},"322":{"dur":4,"text":"And the reason that\nit's named a parsec"},"327":{"dur":5,"text":"is that it is the\nangular shift that you"},"332":{"dur":5,"text":"see

this\nroom is familiar with it--"},"353":{"dur":3,"text":"if you hold your arm out,\nor your finger out at arm's"},"357":{"dur":2,"text":"length, and blink your\neyes back and forth,"},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"you'll see your finger move\nacross distant background"},"361":{"dur":1,"text":"objects."},"363":{"dur":3,"text":"You bring your finger\ncloser to your nose,"},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"and that shift becomes\ngreater and greater."},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"The same thing\nhappens with stars."},"370":{"dur":4,"text":"So a nearby star, shown in\nblue here, if one eyeball"},"375":{"dur":5,"text":"is in July-- you'd take an image\nof that field of stars in July,"},"381":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's like blinking\nyour eye back and forth--"},"383":{"dur":3,"text":"you take the same image again\nsix months later in January,"},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"and that nearby star\nwill appear to shift"},"390":{"dur":3,"text":"its position with respect\nto more distant stars."},"393":{"dur":3,"text":"And so that shift is known\nas the parallactic angle."},"397":{"dur":3,"text":"It is a key distance indicator\nfor all of astronomy."},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"The reason that this is so\nimportant and so fundamental--"},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'll come back\nto this a few times--"},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"is that we can\nmeasure the distance"},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"to nearby stars\nwith no assumptions."},"411":{"dur":3,"text":"This is a purely\ngeometric measurement."},"414":{"dur":1,"text":"It's very hard to do."},"416":{"dur":3,"text":"So an arc second is an\nextremely small angle."},"419":{"dur":4,"text":"Most stars have shifts that\nare nearly 100 times smaller"},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"than that."},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"And so the limit that\nwe can get out to"},"427":{"dur":3,"text":"is something like 50 to\n100 parsecs, currently."},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that means that\nthere's only a few hundred,"},"433":{"dur":4,"text":"maybe about 1,000 stars, where\nwe can measure their distances"},"438":{"dur":3,"text":"directly using this technique."},"441":{"dur":1,"text":"But they're very, very valuable."},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"They're what's known\nas a fundamental"},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"wrong on the distance ladder."},"447":{"dur":4,"text":"Because if we can get\nthe distance directly,"},"451":{"dur":1,"text":"then we can calculate\nsomething known"},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"as the absolute magnitude."},"454":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is the only equation\nthat will appear in the talk."},"457":{"dur":3,"text":"If you have the apparent\nmagnitude of a star, which"},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"is just what you would see\nif you just measured it."},"463":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's saying that star is\nbright, that star is faint."},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"If you have the\ndistance here, then"},"469":{"dur":3,"text":"you can calculate the absolute\nmagnitude of the star."},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"And why that's important,\nthe absolute magnitude"},"475":{"dur":3,"text":"is a tracer of the star's\nfundamental properties."},"478":{"dur":1,"text":"So if you know the\nabsolute magnitude,"},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"you know something about\nthe size of the star,"},"482":{"dur":3,"text":"you know something\nabout its mass,"},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"potentially about\nits composition."},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"And so it becomes\nvery, very valuable"},"491":{"dur":4,"text":"to use these nearby stars\nto calibrate relations"},"495":{"dur":5,"text":"between absolute magnitude\nand other observables."},"500":{"dur":4,"text":"And for those of you who are\nup on your logarithm scales,"},"505":{"dur":1,"text":"the absolute\nmagnitude is formally"},"507":{"dur":3,"text":"defined as what the star's\napparent magnitude would"},"510":{"dur":3,"text":"be at a distance of 10 parsecs."},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"You plug in 10 here,\nthis side is zero."},"516":{"dur":6,"text":"And so it places all stars on\nthe same fundamental scale."},"523":{"dur":3,"text":"And so if you don't\nknow the distance,"},"527":{"dur":3,"text":"if the star is beyond\nour current capabilities"},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"of measuring a\nparallactic angle shift,"},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"then we need to use\nthe star's color"},"536":{"dur":3,"text":"to infer its absolute magnitude."},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"And the way this is\ndone is with images"},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"like the one that's\nbeing shown here."},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"This is an image of\na cluster of stars"},"547":{"dur":4,"text":"and it essentially-- I'll\nstep

brightness,"},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"their absolute magnitude."},"563":{"dur":4,"text":"So this image is actually\na little bit of a fake."},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"So the images that we\nget from the telescope"},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"don't actually appear in color."},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"We use filters."},"574":{"dur":3,"text":"And so the combination\nof different filters"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"give you the nice color\nimage that you see here."},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"And this was taken with\nthe Hubble Space Telescope."},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"So astronomers will\nuse a blue filter"},"586":{"dur":5,"text":"and recover only the blue\nlight from a particular star,"},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"a green filter that looks\nat only the green part"},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"of the electromagnetic\nspectrum, and a red filter"},"599":{"dur":4,"text":"to produce the full color\nimage that you see here."},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"And so you can see that,\ndepending on whether or not"},"606":{"dur":3,"text":"a star is intrinsically\nred, like the one"},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"in the upper right hand part of\nthe diagram that contains quite"},"612":{"dur":4,"text":"a lot of red light, or a\nblue star like these two"},"617":{"dur":4,"text":"here on the bottom-- let's\nskip back just a little bit--"},"621":{"dur":3,"text":"those intrinsically are\nproducing more blue light"},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"then the red stars that we see."},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"So the color of stars\nactually gives us"},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"a lot information\nabout the stars."},"632":{"dur":4,"text":"And my wife may actually\ndisagree about this,"},"636":{"dur":3,"text":"but astronomers really like\nto be orderly and organized."},"640":{"dur":2,"text":"And so they always try\nto sort things out."},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we like to put red\nstars on the right, blue stars"},"646":{"dur":1,"text":"on the left."},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"So we'll do that."},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"And we also like to characterize\nthings by their brightness."},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"And typically, the\nintrinsically bright stars"},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"are placed on the\ntop of diagrams,"},"658":{"dur":4,"text":"and the intrinsically faint\nstars are placed on the bottom."},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"And so what this\ndiagram really is,"},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"it's known as a color\nmagnitude diagram."},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"So on the x-axis,\nwe talk about color."},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"We put blue stars on the\nleft, red stars on the right."},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"And the magnitude, short\nfor absolute magnitude,"},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"we take stars that are\nintrinsically

the stars that\nare on the bottom part"},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"of the main sequence,\nthe cool red dwarfs,"},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"are putting out something\nlike 1\/100th to
