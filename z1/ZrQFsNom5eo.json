he grew up with this kind\nof hatred of Freud."},"214":{"dur":3,"text":"And when he took over the\neditorship of the DSM, he"},"217":{"dur":3,"text":"decided that it was his destiny\nto eradicate Freud"},"221":{"dur":3,"text":"from psychiatry and replace all\nthat sleuthing around the"},"224":{"dur":4,"text":"unconscious with checklists."},"229":{"dur":2,"text":"So he called all his like-minded\npeople into"},"231":{"dur":2,"text":"conference rooms at Columbia,\nand he'd say, who's got ideas"},"233":{"dur":1,"text":"for the mental disorders?"},"235":{"dur":1,"text":"And people would go, oh, ADHD!"},"236":{"dur":1,"text":"And he'd go, what's\nthe checklist?"},"238":{"dur":2,"text":"And he'd type it into\nhis typewriter."},"240":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's how ADHD came to\nbe a mental disorder."},"244":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's how bulimia came to\nbe in the DSM, and so on."},"248":{"dur":3,"text":"The person who shouted the\nloudest, he would listen to"},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"them, and he'd type it into his\nold typewriter, and there"},"254":{"dur":1,"text":"it was, sealed in stone."},"256":{"dur":3,"text":"And I said to him, when I met\nhim in Princeton, a couple of"},"259":{"dur":4,"text":"years ago, I said, were there\nany proposed mental disorders"},"264":{"dur":1,"text":"that you rejected?"},"266":{"dur":3,"text":"And he said, yeah,\nthere was one."},"269":{"dur":3,"text":"Atypical child syndrome."},"272":{"dur":3,"text":"He said the problem with it\nwas when I asked the man"},"276":{"dur":3,"text":"proposing it what the shared\ncharacteristics were, he said,"},"279":{"dur":1,"text":"that's very hard to\nsay, because the"},"280":{"dur":1,"text":"children are very

changed\nthe name to self-defeating"},"298":{"dur":3,"text":"personality disorder and shoved\nit in the appendix."},"301":{"dur":3,"text":"So this was much later."},"305":{"dur":3,"text":"And when I

meet a\ncritic of psychiatry to get"},"317":{"dur":4,"text":"their view, which is how I ended\nup having lunch with the"},"321":{"dur":1,"text":"Scientologists."},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was a crack team\nof Scientologists."},"326":{"dur":0,"text":"This was in London."},"327":{"dur":1,"text":"They're called the CCHR."},"328":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's their destiny\nto

your\nideology to me?"},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"And he said, yes, I can\nprove it to you."},"357":{"dur":1,"text":"And I said, how?"},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"And he said, I can introduce\nyou to Tony."},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"And I said, who's Tony?"},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"And he said, Tony's\nin Broadmoor."},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"And Broadmoor is Broadmoor\nHospital."},"368":{"dur":5,"text":"It was Britain's most notorious,\nmythologically"},"373":{"dur":4,"text":"notorious asylum for the\ncriminally insane."},"378":{"dur":2,"text":"It's now called, of course,\nBroadmoor Hospital."},"380":{"dur":3,"text":"And I said, what did Tony do?"},"384":{"dur":3,"text":"And Brian said, hardly\nanything."},"388":{"dur":2,"text":"He beat someone up\nwith something."},"390":{"dur":4,"text":"But the point is, he decided to\nfake madness to get out of"},"394":{"dur":3,"text":"a prison sentence, and he faked\nit too well, and now"},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"he's stuck in Broadmoor."},"399":{"dur":2,"text":"And the more he tries to\nconvince the psychiatrists"},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"there that he's sane, the more\nthey take it as evidence that"},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"he's crazy."},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"Do you want us to get you into\nBroadmoor to meet Tony?"},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"So I said, yes, please."},"410":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'm going to read a tiny\nbit from \"The Psychopath"},"412":{"dur":3,"text":"Test,\" what happened when\nI went to Broadmoor."},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"I got the train there."},"417":{"dur":3,"text":"I began to yawn uncontrollably\naround Kempton Park, which is"},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"what dogs also do\nwhen anxious."},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"And I got to Broadmoor, and I\nmet Brian, and we were taken"},"426":{"dur":4,"text":"through high-security gate after\ngate after gate into the"},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"Wellness Center, which\nis where you"},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"get to meet the patients."},"434":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's all calming colors,\nlike peaches and pine."},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'm going to do a little\nmicrophone

was getting a--"},"446":{"dur":1,"text":"great."},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"OK."},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"So the Wellness Center at\nBroadmoor, it's all peach and"},"451":{"dur":1,"text":"pine and calming colors."},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"It looks like a kind\nof travel inn."},"456":{"dur":5,"text":"And the only bold colors are the\nreds of the panic buttons."},"461":{"dur":4,"text":"And Brian said to

Center."},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"And I said, what does\nDSPD stand for?"},"473":{"dur":3,"text":"And Brian said, Dangerous and\nSevere Personality Disorder."},"476":{"dur":3,"text":"And I said, is Tony in the part\nof Broadmoor that houses"},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"the most dangerous people?"},"481":{"dur":3,"text":"And Brian said, yeah,\nisn't that insane?"},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"And then the patients started\ndrifting in, and they're all"},"488":{"dur":5,"text":"quite overweight and wearing\nsweatpants and shuffling, and"},"493":{"dur":1,"text":"they had sort of doleful eyes."},"495":{"dur":3,"text":"And Brian whispered to me,\nthey're medicated."},"498":{"dur":3,"text":"Which, to a Scientologist, is\nlike the worst evil in the"},"502":{"dur":3,"text":"world, but I'm thinking it's\npresumably a good idea."},"505":{"dur":4,"text":"And then Brian said,\nhere's Tony."},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"And a man was walking towards\nme, and he wasn't overweight."},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"He was in excellent physical\ncondition."},"515":{"dur":1,"text":"And he wasn't wearing\nsweatpants."},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"He was wearing a\npinstripe

said, is\nit true that you faked your"},"528":{"dur":0,"text":"way in here?"},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"And he said, yeah, absolutely."},"530":{"dur":5,"text":"I beat a man up in Reading,\nwhich is just west of London."},"536":{"dur":3,"text":"And I was on remand, and my\ncellmate said, you're looking"},"540":{"dur":1,"text":"at five to seven\nyears for this."},"542":{"dur":2,"text":"What you have to do\nis fake madness."},"544":{"dur":1,"text":"Tell them you're mad."},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"You'll get sent to some\ncushy hospital."},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"You'll have your own\nPlayStation."},"549":{"dur":3,"text":"Nurses will bring you pizzas."},"552":{"dur":1,"text":"So he says, so that's\nwhat I did."},"554":{"dur":1,"text":"And I said, how to do it?"},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"He said, well, I asked to see\nthe prison psychiatrist."},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'd just seen a film called\n\"Crash,\" in which"},"560":{"dur":4,"text":"people get sexual pleasure from\ncrashing cars into walls."},"564":{"dur":3,"text":"So I said to the psychiatrist,\nI get sexual pleasure from"},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"crashing cars into walls."},"569":{"dur":1,"text":"And I said, what else?"},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"And he said, oh, I told the\npsychiatrist that I wanted to"},"574":{"dur":3,"text":"watch women as they died,\nbecause it would make me feel"},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"more normal."},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"And I said, where'd\nyou get that from?"},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"And he said, oh, from a\nbiography of Ted Bundy that"},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"they had in the prison\nlibrary."},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"So anyway, I faked\nmadness too well."},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"They didn't send me some\ncushy

the"},"595":{"dur":0,"text":"psychiatrist."},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"I said, there's been a terrible\nmisunderstanding."},"599":{"dur":1,"text":"I said, how long have\nyou been here

actual\ninvisibility?"},"711":{"dur":4,"text":"And he said, at first, but after\na while, we adapted it"},"716":{"dur":3,"text":"to just trying to find a\nway of not being seen."},"719":{"dur":1,"text":"So I said, like camouflage?"},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"And he went, no."},"722":{"dur":1,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"He said, level four was we had\na master sergeant that could"},"728":{"dur":4,"text":"stop the heart of a goat just\nby wanting it to stop."},"732":{"dur":1,"text":"And I said, did he\never manage it?"},"734":{"dur":1,"text":"And he

only in Broadmoor would not\nwanting to hang out with"},"802":{"dur":3,"text":"serial killers be considered\na sign of madness."},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"Anyway, Tony seemed completely\nfine to me."},"809":{"dur":1,"text":"Just normal and sane."},"810":{"dur":1,"text":"But obviously, what\ndid I know?"},"812":{"dur":3,"text":"So when I got home, I wrote to\nhis clinician, Anthony
