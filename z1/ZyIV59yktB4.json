{"0":{"dur":4,"text":"Janice Dundas: Okay so we're going to be working\nthrough a problem today that we did in class,"},"4":{"dur":4,"text":"and there's actually four sections to this\nproblem, and it's all under this heading of"},"8":{"dur":4,"text":"biomechanical modelling. So if you remember\nthe different methodological areas of occupational"},"13":{"dur":6,"text":"biomechanics, the one involved with biomechanical\nmodelling is where we analyze all the forces"},"19":{"dur":5,"text":"and all the different torques that are happening\nat a particular linked segment, in order to"},"24":{"dur":5,"text":"see sort of the hardship that the joints are\ntaking, and when we finally figure out what's"},"30":{"dur":7,"text":"going on with a particular person in the workplace\narena, we can go back and look at what joints"},"37":{"dur":5,"text":"statistically are able to handle, with respect\nto forces, and we can see whether the person"},"42":{"dur":5,"text":"is being set up for a disability or an injury\nor some type of strain and we can avoid it"},"47":{"dur":4,"text":"by altering the loads that they have. So what\nI want to do is I want to work through the"},"52":{"dur":6,"text":"problem with you, and you can pause the computer\nat any time. I want you to have the problem"},"58":{"dur":3,"text":"in front of you. So we did one in class. So\nI want you to go through it again. That's"},"62":{"dur":4,"text":"the one that we're doing. And I gave you one\nto do at home. So we will be looking at the"},"67":{"dur":5,"text":"one I gave you at home next week when we come\nback to class. So I want you to work through"},"72":{"dur":3,"text":"that, but use this as your foundational knowledge,\nand just keep reviewing it and reviewing it."},"76":{"dur":3,"text":"Because it's really important when we get\nto our application forces, our application"},"80":{"dur":5,"text":"plans, coming up next week. Okay, so the first\nproblem is we are dealing with somebody who"},"85":{"dur":6,"text":"is anthropometrically average sized. So they're\nholding a load in both hands. So it's a static"},"92":{"dur":3,"text":"model. That's what we talked about. We're\nnot going to be looking at dynamic models."},"95":{"dur":4,"text":"At about waist height, and they're holding\nthis mass in front of their body. The load"},"100":{"dur":3,"text":"is equally balanced between both hands, and\nit's important to understand that. And the"},"103":{"dur":5,"text":"forearms are horizontally located. And the\nmass is 10 kilograms. So I'm going to write"},"108":{"dur":4,"text":"that down. 10 kilograms. So that's the mass\nthat we're looking at, that they\u2019re holding,"},"113":{"dur":4,"text":"in this type of position. Okay, so the first\none is to determine the weight of the load."},"118":{"dur":5,"text":"So in class, we learnt that when you're looking\nat weight you're looking at the mass times"},"123":{"dur":8,"text":"the effect of gravity. Well, the mass we know\nhere is 10 kilograms, and gravity is 9.8 metres"},"132":{"dur":6,"text":"per second squared. So when we're looking\nat weight and we multiply 10 kilograms times"},"138":{"dur":7,"text":"9.8, we end up with 98 newtons. So that's\nwhat the weight is of this load. And if you"},"145":{"dur":5,"text":"remember, when we talked about forces, forces\nare always recognized by vector, by a direction"},"151":{"dur":6,"text":"of the vector, and by point of application\nof where the force is. So this is a weight."},"157":{"dur":5,"text":"It's going down. So it's negative. And if\nwe were looking at the mass, and we were looking"},"163":{"dur":6,"text":"at the hand, I'll just draw it quick here.\nIt's right at the centre, and it's going down"},"169":{"dur":5,"text":"at 98 newtons. So that would be our drawing\nthat would represent this force. Okay so that's"},"175":{"dur":4,"text":"the first question. So it asked you to identify\nthe weight of the load. And then it asks you"},"179":{"dur":6,"text":"to identify the characteristics of this particular\nvector. So it says the magnitude. We know"},"186":{"dur":6,"text":"the magnitude is 98 newtons. It says the direction,\nit's going downward, so we don't have to put"},"193":{"dur":4,"text":"negative because we put the vector already\nthere representing a downward direction. If"},"198":{"dur":4,"text":"it was going upward, that would be a positive.\nSo it's an external load. Line of action is"},"202":{"dur":4,"text":"vertical because it's happening in the line\nof gravity, and the point of application is"},"206":{"dur":4,"text":"the centre of the hand. So right where the\ncentre of this mass is, so if you had this"},"211":{"dur":4,"text":"big load, it would be the centre of the mass\nof the big load, which we'll just put right"},"216":{"dur":3,"text":"in the centre of the hand. So those are our\ndifferent characteristics, that this weight"},"220":{"dur":6,"text":"vector that we're looking at. So it asks you\nnext, in question number 3, it says since"},"227":{"dur":5,"text":"the load is in a state of equilibrium, static,\nthe upward force of the hands are acting to"},"232":{"dur":5,"text":"equally balance this negative weight going\ndown. So we call this a summation of forces."},"237":{"dur":5,"text":"It's Newton's Law, it's the third law, that\nthere's always an equal and opposite reaction."},"243":{"dur":5,"text":"So when you're looking at this particular\nvector, we know that the reacting vector of"},"248":{"dur":6,"text":"this hand would be exactly 98 newtons going\nupwards. Okay? So the reactive equals the"},"255":{"dur":7,"text":"reactive, so we're going to put R for reactive\nforce, and the reactive force equals the weight,"},"263":{"dur":7,"text":"so the reactive force equals 98. But it's\ngoing up, so it's 98 newtons going up. Okay,"},"270":{"dur":6,"text":"so now what we're going to do is we're going\nto determine what the reactive force is for"},"276":{"dur":6,"text":"each hand. So as we said in our model, two\nhands are holding this. So we want to break"},"283":{"dur":3,"text":"it up. And it says that they're taking equal\nweight. Well, it's easy. We can figure that"},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"out right away, but I'm going to show you\nthe formula that you can use, because it says"},"289":{"dur":4,"text":"one hand is carrying two-thirds of the load,\nand whatever, you can work it through. So"},"293":{"dur":1,"text":"we know the sum of the forces"},"299":{"dur":0,"text":"equals zero."},"302":{"dur":3,"text":"So we know weight, plus the reactive force,"},"305":{"dur":10,"text":"equals zero. So the weight is negative 98\nnewtons, and the reactive force is 98 newtons."},"316":{"dur":5,"text":"So we want to divide this up because this\nrepresents both hands. So let's do it weight"},"322":{"dur":8,"text":"plus 2, reactive forces of the hands, equals\nzero. So we have negative 98, and this two"},"331":{"dur":7,"text":"reactive forces, is worth 98 plus 2 reactive\nforces of the hands, equals zero. So let's"},"339":{"dur":4,"text":"relocate things. I'll just make this a little\ncleaner. Let's relocate things so that we"},"343":{"dur":9,"text":"can solve for R. And so we have 2R of the\nhands, equal 98, because we've just relocated"},"352":{"dur":5,"text":"the 98 over, so we lose the negative. We added\n98 here, we're adding 98 here. So our reactive"},"358":{"dur":5,"text":"force of our hand, I'm going to take out.\nI'm going to take out the S there. Reactive"},"364":{"dur":8,"text":"force of the hand equals 98, divided by 2,\nwhich equals 49 newtons. So that is a reactive"},"372":{"dur":6,"text":"force of the hand. So one hand would be 49\nnewtons going upwards. Okay. Now, we have"},"378":{"dur":3,"text":"assumed that the centre of mass, it says here\nright in your questions, it says assume the"},"382":{"dur":3,"text":"centre of mass is directly between the two\nhands. If not, we'd have to alter it, and"},"386":{"dur":3,"text":"we'd have to change our investigation a little\nbit. Okay, so now what we're going to do is"},"390":{"dur":4,"text":"we're going to do our free body diagram, that\nrepresents the forces that are exerted. So"},"394":{"dur":3,"text":"we're going to look at just the forearm, and\nthe hand, and we're going to look at them"},"398":{"dur":6,"text":"as one unit together. So here is some different\ndelineations of things that have been given"},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"to you. So I'm going to put a little line\nhere and we're going to head over. And so"},"408":{"dur":3,"text":"first of all, we've given the link length\nof the forearm and the hand, so forearm and"},"412":{"dur":3,"text":"hand, I'll do that. Link length"},"418":{"dur":6,"text":"equals, and\nwe've been given 35.5 cm. So that's the link"},"425":{"dur":4,"text":"length from the elbow to the middle of the\nhand, as we've identified last, when we did"},"429":{"dur":7,"text":"it a couple of weeks ago in our anthropometric\nmeasures. The centre of mass from proximal"},"439":{"dur":8,"text":"has been identified as being 17.2 centimetres.\nThe weight of that, so the weight"},"449":{"dur":0,"text":"of forearm,"},"453":{"dur":6,"text":"and hand, equals negative, so you should already\nunderstand what that means, that means that"},"460":{"dur":9,"text":"it's going downwards. So negative 15.8 newtons,\nand the weight of--we're going to do just"},"469":{"dur":5,"text":"one hand now--the weight of the load in one\nhand"},"477":{"dur":0,"text":"equals"},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"again negative, and we have 49 newtons."},"482":{"dur":5,"text":"So let's draw our free body diagram.\nWe have here representing our elbow, and there"},"487":{"dur":5,"text":"is a nice diagram in your actual thing, when\nyou look at the answers that I've uploaded,"},"493":{"dur":5,"text":"and you've got this mass that is being held\nhere. And this is the centre of your hand."},"498":{"dur":4,"text":"So when we do the centre of mass, let's do\nit approximately here. We know that the distance"},"503":{"dur":9,"text":"from proximal is 17.2 cm. So let's draw that\non. We also know the weight of the centre"},"512":{"dur":6,"text":"of the mass, it's going down, is negative\n15.8, we don't have to put negative because"},"519":{"dur":8,"text":"we already identified it. So 15.8 newtons.\nSo that's the one particular force and location"},"527":{"dur":8,"text":"from the axis. So let's look at the next one.\nRemember, vector size, also, this isn't exactly"},"536":{"dur":4,"text":"proportionate, but the larger the vector it\nmeans the larger the force. So this is 49."},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"We determined that's the weight of one hand,\nif I were to draw your hand here, it would"},"543":{"dur":7,"text":"be holding that weight. And the distance was given to you of 35.5 centimetres."},"553":{"dur":5,"text":"Okay, so that's our thing. Now, I want to take a little aside here, and I want you to get out your"},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"handout that we had in lab. So I want you\nto take a pause on your computer, and I want"},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"you to get your handout, and I want to do\none little quick exercise with you to see"},"566":{"dur":7,"text":"if you could go backwards in order to identify\nthe particular height and weight of this person."},"574":{"dur":5,"text":"Okay? So get your handout out, and let's do\nit. Okay, so now I want to work backwards"},"579":{"dur":4,"text":"a little bit with this, and I want you to\ntell me what the weight of this man is. So"},"584":{"dur":5,"text":"I gave you these particular dimensions, but\nwe can use them to backtrack and find out"},"589":{"dur":3,"text":"what the weight--so we know the weight of\nthe forearm and the hand. So let's just do"},"593":{"dur":6,"text":"it without any kind of--the weight of the\nforearm and the hand is 15.8 newtons, so we"},"600":{"dur":3,"text":"won't put negative. It is going down, but\nwe won't put that on there. So we know it's"},"604":{"dur":5,"text":"15.8 newtons. And if you look back at this\nwinter's table that I gave you in lab, we"},"610":{"dur":7,"text":"can see that when you look at forearm and\nhand, that the weight segment is .022,"},"618":{"dur":6,"text":"of the total body mass, so when you put this into a formula and you look at the formula"},"625":{"dur":7,"text":"that you're doing, you would do .022 times\nthe total body weight, because we're looking"},"633":{"dur":6,"text":"in newtons now, we're not talking about mass,\nwe're looking in newtons. And that would equal"},"639":{"dur":6,"text":"the weight of the forearm and hand. Okay so\nwe know what the weight of the forearm and"},"645":{"dur":10,"text":"hand is, so let's plug that in. So .022 times\nthe total body weight--whoops! Equals 15.8"},"655":{"dur":6,"text":"newtons. So when we take and we do our formula\nand take this side over, we need to divide"},"661":{"dur":6,"text":"this side by .022 to get rid of it, and we\nneed to divide that side as well. So total"},"668":{"dur":11,"text":"body weight equals 15.8 newtons divided by\n.022. So the total body weight of this individual"},"680":{"dur":7,"text":"is as I came out with my calculations, is\n718 newtons. So now you can use that to go"},"687":{"dur":4,"text":"back and calculate the segment length for\nthe rest of his body and you could apply all"},"692":{"dur":3,"text":"this together. So that's a little back track\nto show that you could do that also with centre"},"695":{"dur":7,"text":"of mass, and with link length to find out\nthe height. Okay, so now let's go back. And"},"703":{"dur":4,"text":"that was just a little aside. So now I want\nyou to go back to number 4 of this particular"},"707":{"dur":4,"text":"problem. And it gave us all the different\ncomponents. We drew our free body diagram,"},"712":{"dur":5,"text":"and if you go down to the bottom it says draw\non the reactive force. So we've got the forces"},"717":{"dur":4,"text":"going down, but we know there's always an\nequal and opposite reaction. So this is where"},"721":{"dur":5,"text":"our occupational biomechanical sort of investigation\ncomes in, because if we're exerting this force,"},"727":{"dur":4,"text":"we know that the elbow is going to take the\nblunt--the brunt--of it. And so what we need"},"731":{"dur":5,"text":"to do is we need to draw on, and I'm just\ngoing to use this here--a reactive force."},"736":{"dur":3,"text":"So again, if you remember Newton's Third Law,\nfor every action there is an equal and opposite"},"740":{"dur":5,"text":"reaction, and so these are the forces going\ndown. So the reactive force at the elbow would"},"746":{"dur":4,"text":"be the sum of these two. And so if you were\nto add up the reactive forces, this is the"},"750":{"dur":4,"text":"sum of the forces, I'm going to do it down\nhere. Sum of, so the reactive force, we always"},"755":{"dur":5,"text":"do that in R. And then we will do the weight,\ngoing down, the external weights, in W. So"},"760":{"dur":10,"text":"the reactive force equals the sum of the forces.\nGoing down so the negative sum. Another way"},"770":{"dur":9,"text":"you can write it is the total sum of the forces\nequals zero. So all of these forces equal"},"780":{"dur":11,"text":"zero. So now we have the R, the reactive force,\nplus the negative force, negative 15.8, plus,"},"791":{"dur":6,"text":"because it's going downwards, negative 49\nequals zero. So we're going to relocate. We're"},"798":{"dur":4,"text":"going to relocate these over, so I'm going\nto just go up here, and I'm going to say R"},"802":{"dur":11,"text":"equals 15.8, plus 49. So the reactive force\nat the elbow should come out to 64.8 newtons."},"814":{"dur":6,"text":"Now, I don't have to put a negative there.\nI can just leave it. But if you wanted just"},"820":{"dur":3,"text":"a representation it's positive, it means it's\ngoing up, but you don't ever have to assume."},"824":{"dur":5,"text":"They assume it's positive if you put it there.\nOkay? So that's 64. So let me label it here,"},"830":{"dur":8,"text":"64.8 newtons going up. So there's our forces.\nSo that's our free body diagram. Now we know"},"838":{"dur":5,"text":"that as it says down here, these are all linear\nforces, but we know that our body doesn't"},"844":{"dur":5,"text":"work linearly, it works on an angular movement.\nAnd we talked a little about that with torque,"},"849":{"dur":6,"text":"and we did some problems last class in order\nto identify what torque is. So definition"},"856":{"dur":6,"text":"of torque is force times your moment arm.\nSo if I were to look at the torque, or we"},"862":{"dur":4,"text":"call it the moments, happening, we know that\nthis force is pushing it down, so we're going"},"866":{"dur":5,"text":"to look at this torque, we're going to look\nat this torque, and then this one is going"},"872":{"dur":7,"text":"up, so we're going to look at this torque.\nNow this torque is easy to find once we know"},"879":{"dur":4,"text":"these, because again, we revert back to Newton's\nThird Law, and for every action there is an"},"884":{"dur":4,"text":"equal and opposite reaction. So if we figure\nout these two torques, we can easily figure"},"888":{"dur":4,"text":"out that torque because it is equal to both\nof those together. So let's look, and it says"},"893":{"dur":3,"text":"here, the loads are located away from the\naxis. I'll read through your problem with you."},"896":{"dur":4,"text":"Number six we are looking at. And they\ncreate a moment, or a torque. That's another"},"901":{"dur":6,"text":"term for it. And it's simply the force times\nthe perpendicular distance away. So what we"},"907":{"dur":4,"text":"want to do is we want to find the moment or\nthe torque of the load. So we're looking at"},"911":{"dur":5,"text":"this one here. And so when we're looking at\nthe torque of the load, or the moment of the"},"917":{"dur":8,"text":"load, we look at force, which is 49, times\nthe perpendicular distance. Now, torque is"},"926":{"dur":3,"text":"done in newton metres, and so we know that\nthis is in centimetres. So we need to convert"},"930":{"dur":3,"text":"it to metres. So we're just going to take\nthe decimal point back two places. And so"},"934":{"dur":7,"text":"we're going to do it times .355, so it's newtons,\nand we have metres. Our answer is always in"},"941":{"dur":8,"text":"newton metres for torque. So we have .355\ntimes 49, and it's always good to keep your"},"949":{"dur":7,"text":"mind active as to what the direction is. So\nI always suggest that we put in the sign here."},"956":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'm just going to leave that out, we don't--you\ndon't ever--you don't have to put in newtons"},"959":{"dur":5,"text":"in centimetres or metres when you're doing\nthat. So when you look at the torque here,"},"965":{"dur":11,"text":"and you multiply 49 times .355 what you get\nis negative 17.4. So that is the torque right"},"976":{"dur":6,"text":"here, 17.4. And that is in newton metres.\nAnd that is what is going down. So that is"},"983":{"dur":4,"text":"the first moment that is taking place. The\nsecond moment is the moment or the torque"},"987":{"dur":4,"text":"that is caused by the weight of your forearm\nand your hand. So let's do this--forearm and"},"992":{"dur":7,"text":"hand, and that equals, we have 15, so we're\ngoing to put it negative 15.8, and again,"},"999":{"dur":2,"text":"it's in newtons, but we're not going to do\nthat, and times, we're going to take this"},"1001":{"dur":9,"text":"back to metres, .172 metres. And our resulting\nanswer is negative 2.7. So if we draw this"},"1011":{"dur":8,"text":"on right here, we can say 2.7 newton metres.\nOkay so a little bit of a test for you. If"},"1020":{"dur":5,"text":"this is 17.4 newton metres, and this is 2.7\nnewton metres, you should be able to figure"},"1026":{"dur":6,"text":"out what this torque is because they have\nto balance out. So let's just write this down."},"1032":{"dur":8,"text":"The torque at the elbow plus the torque from\nthe forearm and the hand, plus the torque"},"1040":{"dur":6,"text":"from the load. They have to sum up and equal\nzero. So let's isolate, and let's take these."},"1046":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, let's put the values in actually first.\nSo the torque of the elbow plus, and it's"},"1051":{"dur":9,"text":"negative here, so we always need to put it\nin brackets. Negative 2.7 plus negative 17.4,"},"1061":{"dur":4,"text":"equals zero. So now we're going to relocate\nthese to the other side of the equation."},"1065":{"dur":13,"text":"So the torque of the elbow equals 2.7 plus 17.4.\nWhich equals 20.1 newton metres."},"1079":{"dur":8,"text":"So that is the value for this. So now we can look back statistically and we can say can our elbow"},"1087":{"dur":5,"text":"handle that kind of force? Is the load too\nheavy? And we have a lot of statistical data"},"1092":{"dur":4,"text":"in order to tell us what the average man of\nthis particular height and this particular"},"1097":{"dur":4,"text":"stature can handle. So that's what we take\nback. We do an analysis of this particular"},"1102":{"dur":4,"text":"weight loading component of their job, and\nwe can go back and we can figure it out, and"},"1106":{"dur":3,"text":"so we either need to change their job description\nso that they lower the load, or it's okay"},"1110":{"dur":7,"text":"for the average person that is involved in\nthat work. Okay, so that's it for this particular one."},"1117":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to change it, and we're going to have"},"1122":{"dur":6,"text":"the load be--and we talked about this last\ntime--at 20 degrees below horizontal. So sometimes"},"1128":{"dur":3,"text":"you're not always carrying at 90 degrees.\nSo we're going to go 20 degrees below, and"},"1132":{"dur":4,"text":"we're going to see how the value changes.\nSo I'm not going to erase all this right now,"},"1137":{"dur":6,"text":"because it's an easy formula to do. And when\nI gave this to you in class, I showed you"},"1143":{"dur":5,"text":"this chart, which shows the cosine values.\nSo if you go down on the cosine values, and"},"1149":{"dur":5,"text":"you go down to 20 degrees, you will see across\ncosine, because it goes sine, cosine, and"},"1154":{"dur":8,"text":"tangents, that there is a value there of .9397.\nSo I'm just going to write this down, .9,"},"1162":{"dur":9,"text":"let me just do 397. So we know that if we're\nlooking at any kind of value for torque, if"},"1172":{"dur":4,"text":"we simply multiply it by the cosine of the\nangle, so we've got a 20 degree angle now"},"1177":{"dur":4,"text":"happening, then we get the new torque. So\nyou don't have to redo any calculations or"},"1181":{"dur":5,"text":"any kind of moments or anything like that.\nAll you have to do is multiply the torque"},"1187":{"dur":7,"text":"by that cosine value. So let's do that. And\nlet's figure out what the answer is here."},"1194":{"dur":7,"text":"So when we multiply it, we will do .9, so\nhere's our formula, .9397 and we're just going"},"1201":{"dur":8,"text":"to do the elbow, which is 20.1, so this is\nwhat we're talking about, the new torque"},"1210":{"dur":10,"text":"at 20 degrees equals .9397 times our old torque,\nwhich is 20.1, and it equals, when we get"},"1221":{"dur":6,"text":"to our value, of 18.8 newton metres. So I\nwant you to look at this, and I want you to"},"1228":{"dur":5,"text":"compare. So when they were holding it here,\nthe torque that was being assumed was 20.1,"},"1234":{"dur":5,"text":"but when they go down 20 degrees, now the\ntorque is 18.8, so by lowering the load they"},"1239":{"dur":3,"text":"decrease the torque that's happening. At the\nelbow. So that's another thing that you can"},"1243":{"dur":4,"text":"apply to occupational biomechanics, where\nyou can take the load, and if you lower it,"},"1248":{"dur":4,"text":"then you decrease the actual strain that's\nhappening at the elbow. And we saw that in"},"1252":{"dur":4,"text":"the values, when we did it a couple weeks\nago and looked at it. Okay so from here, up"},"1257":{"dur":4,"text":"until now, we've looked at a single.

And so that the person"},"1295":{"dur":3,"text":"is now holding it out, and it's going to be\nreally interesting to see what happens at"},"1299":{"dur":4,"text":"the shoulder with respect to the strain that\nyou put on it when you do that. So I'm going"},"1303":{"dur":3,"text":"to take a few seconds and I'm going to draw.\nI think you already have it in your notes,"},"1307":{"dur":4,"text":"but I'm going to draw the free body diagrams\nthat are associated with this. So you're already"},"1311":{"dur":6,"text":"given the diagrams. So this is the forearm,\nand the hand, and then this is going to be"},"1317":{"dur":5,"text":"the shoulder to the elbow. Okay? So elbow\nto hand, and shoulder. So I'm going to write"},"1322":{"dur":6,"text":"elbow here, and I'm going to write hand here.\nAnd I'm going to write elbow here."},"1330":{"dur":5,"text":"And I'm going to write shoulder. It\u2019d be nice if I could actually draw the body parts, but"},"1335":{"dur":5,"text":"that's not going to work out. So, anyways,\nlet's re-label it and let's do a free body diagram."},"1340":{"dur":5,"text":"So when we're looking at this we're\nactually not holding, we're not going to put"},"1346":{"dur":6,"text":"the load on necessarily, so we're just going\nto put overall the effect that we found out,"},"1352":{"dur":6,"text":"and when you add the load onto the weight\nof the forearm and hand, we know that it totaled"},"1358":{"dur":5,"text":"to be 15.8 newtons. So let's just do that\nto be nice. So if you look back on your things,"},"1363":{"dur":4,"text":"you will see how if you add these two together\nit equals 15.8, it's just going to make it"},"1367":{"dur":4,"text":"nicer. Then we're going to put the reactive\nforce which should be the same size vector,"},"1371":{"dur":8,"text":"but I've run out of space here, 15.8 newtons.\nOkay, good. So now we have, we know, we have"},"1380":{"dur":5,"text":"the moment. So if you look back, when you\nlook back on this, and you can see the overall"},"1385":{"dur":9,"text":"moment of this, so let's just draw this, 17.2\ncentimetres. Okay good. So if you're looking"},"1394":{"dur":10,"text":"at this and you're seeing 17.2 when you multiply\n15.8 by .2, .172, you can see that the torque"},"1405":{"dur":7,"text":"that happens is 2.7. So I'll let you stop\nand you can do that, but you can also add"},"1412":{"dur":5,"text":"it up and figure out that it's 2.7. So we\nknow that the torque going this way causing"},"1418":{"dur":7,"text":"our forearm to push down that way is 2.7,\nso there must be, again, the equal reactive"},"1425":{"dur":6,"text":"torque which is 2.7. Now, I didn't have to\nput in any negative or positive, because of"},"1432":{"dur":3,"text":"the direction of the arrow. Whenever the arrow\nis going down it's negative, and whenever"},"1436":{"dur":6,"text":"the arrow is going up it's positive. So we\nhave a torque here of 2.7, a torque here of"},"1442":{"dur":8,"text":"2.7, we have a weight of 15.8, and we have\na reactive weight of 15.8 newtons. Okay, now,"},"1450":{"dur":5,"text":"I think that's it for this one. Now let's\ngo and let's drawn on the new data on the"},"1456":{"dur":6,"text":"shoulder. So this is what we're given, all\nthis data, so we've gone through the centre"},"1462":{"dur":6,"text":"of mass, centre of mass here, so the centre\nof mass. And we've got the weight of the upper"},"1469":{"dur":7,"text":"extremity, of the upper arm, and it equals\n20.6. Okay so it's 20.6 newtons going down,"},"1476":{"dur":7,"text":"we don't have to put the negative. This distance is 13.2 centimetres."},"1488":{"dur":2,"text":"We also know that we've"},"1490":{"dur":6,"text":"attached this lower part of our arm, from\nour elbow down on, so it's holding the weight"},"1497":{"dur":4,"text":"of the lower arm. So we need to make sure\nthat all the weights are balanced out. And"},"1502":{"dur":4,"text":"this is where I think the most confusing part\nof the whole process is. So you may need to"},"1506":{"dur":4,"text":"look at this a few times in order to grasp\nwhat's going on. And that's okay. And if you"},"1510":{"dur":8,"text":"still have issues, come and see me. So because\nwe have 15.8 going up, the reaction when you"},"1518":{"dur":7,"text":"attach it to the other part of the humerus,\nto the distal part of the humerus is 15.8 newtons"},"1526":{"dur":4,"text":"going down. So these have to equal.\nThat balanced that, and now you've attached"},"1530":{"dur":5,"text":"it, so what's going up, the reactive force\ngoes down here. Because there is 2.7 newton"},"1536":{"dur":5,"text":"metre torque going up, again for every action\nthere is an opposite and equal reaction, we"},"1541":{"dur":6,"text":"have 2.7 newton metres going down. I hope\nyou can see that. That's newton metres going down."},"1549":{"dur":6,"text":"Okay. So that's the force of that. Now,\nwe've added the force of the lower part of"},"1555":{"dur":5,"text":"our arm onto our elbow. We need to know the\ndistance that that force is."},"1562":{"dur":10,"text":"From our axis, of our shoulder. And you're given that, of\n32.9 centimetres. Okay. So we balanced out"},"1573":{"dur":5,"text":"everything. And now what we're going to do is we're going to figure out what the torques are here."},"1579":{"dur":3,"text":"So we know that the first torque\nis from the weight of the upper extremity,"},"1582":{"dur":8,"text":"and so let's try and find the torque of the\nupper extremity equals 20.6 times .132 and"},"1591":{"dur":16,"text":"that equals when you're looking at it 20.6\ntimes .132 which equals negative 2.7 newton metres."},"1608":{"dur":5,"text":"So this is negative, or we'll just\nwrite 2.7. So that's the torque of that one"},"1613":{"dur":5,"text":"going down, which is interesting, but just\ncoincidental, that has 2.7 newton metres going"},"1619":{"dur":7,"text":"down. Now, we need to find the torque of the\nwhole, the weight, of the lower arm on the"},"1627":{"dur":7,"text":"elbow. And so we're going to find the torque\nof the elbow. And I'd like you to try and"},"1634":{"dur":3,"text":"think through that. What would be the values that you would put there?"},"1642":{"dur":7,"text":"So you'd want to take the force, which is 15.8, and you want to times it by the distance, which is .329,"},"1650":{"dur":9,"text":"because we put it into metres. And so the\ntorque of the elbow equals 5.2 newton metres."},"1662":{"dur":5,"text":"Okay, so I drew this one on. And now what\nI'm going to do is I'm going to draw the overall"},"1668":{"dur":12,"text":"torque on top of this one, which is 5.7, 5.2\nnewton metres. Okay. So I hope you're still with me."},"1680":{"dur":4,"text":"So now what we have is we have these\ntwo torques, I'm just going to--I'm going"},"1685":{"dur":8,"text":"to take out a different coloured pen here.\nAnd we have these two torques that are canceling"},"1693":{"dur":3,"text":"each other out. It's not really the greatest\ndifference in colour. But these two torques"},"1697":{"dur":3,"text":"are canceling each other out--that one is\ngoing up, that one is going down, so we don't"},"1700":{"dur":4,"text":"have to even look at those ones. What we're\ngoing to add up is all the other torques that"},"1705":{"dur":5,"text":"are leftover. So if we want to find out the\ntorque that is happening at the shoulder,"},"1712":{"dur":7,"text":"what we add up is this torque, these two balance\nout, that torque, and that torque. So we know"},"1719":{"dur":8,"text":"the sum of all of them equals zero. So let's\ndo the torque of the shoulder plus the torque"},"1727":{"dur":9,"text":"of the upper arm, plus torque of the elbow.\nPlus the torque of the lower arm, of let's"},"1736":{"dur":4,"text":"just say the forearm and hand, so we just\nstay consistent, it equals zero. So the sum"},"1741":{"dur":3,"text":"of the forces equal zero because it's in a\nstatic situation, it's standing there."},"1745":{"dur":4,"text":"So let's isolate, and let's move all of these\nover. So let's do the torque of the shoulder,"},"1752":{"dur":5,"text":"oops, sorry, plus, what's the torque of the\nupper arm when you're looking at it? We found"},"1757":{"dur":6,"text":"it to be, but it's negative, so it's 2.7 plus\nthe torque of the elbow, which is negative"},"1764":{"dur":7,"text":"5.2, plus, coincidentally, the torque of the\nforearm and hand, which is negative 2.7."},"1773":{"dur":3,"text":"When you take all these over, because you have to add here, you add there, you have to add"},"1777":{"dur":5,"text":"here you add there, because they're negative\nvalues, you have the torque of the shoulder,"},"1782":{"dur":11,"text":"equals 2.7 plus 5.2, plus 2.7 which equals--let\nme just make sure I have my thing here, with"},"1793":{"dur":7,"text":"the answer. 10.6 newton metres. So that's\nthe torque of the shoulder. Let's put it up"},"1801":{"dur":6,"text":"here. 10.6 newton metres. Now, I want you\nto look here at the difference right away,"},"1807":{"dur":3,"text":"before we find out the force, because that's\neasy to do now. The torque is the hardest"},"1811":{"dur":7,"text":"thing. So I want you to look at this. If I\nwere just holding this weight with my elbows"},"1818":{"dur":6,"text":"bent, the torque or the force, the torque,\nthe rotary force at the elbow is 2.7, but"},"1825":{"dur":6,"text":"as soon as I hold an item out, the torque\nat my shoulder goes up exponentially to 10.6"},"1831":{"dur":5,"text":"newton metres. And that's why we all know\nyou hold loads closer to you. Now, if you"},"1837":{"dur":4,"text":"add in the cosine value to it and you lower\nit, you decrease the force even more. So that's"},"1841":{"dur":6,"text":"what we're trying to do when we look at modifications\nto workplaces. We look at the forces involved,"},"1848":{"dur":4,"text":"the torques involved, and we try to get as\nminimal effect on the joints as possible."},"1853":{"dur":5,"text":"Okay, so there is two last things to do with\nrespect to this problem and the first one"},"1858":{"dur":7,"text":"is that you've already been given the reactive\nforce on your free body diagram of 36.4. So"},"1866":{"dur":3,"text":"that's a reactive force that's happening at\nthe shoulder, that's in balance with all of"},"1869":{"dur":3,"text":"these. But I want you to figure out, I want\nto work together to figure out where we got"},"1873":{"dur":6,"text":"that particular value from, is 36.4 newtons.\nSo if you add up all of the forces that are"},"1879":{"dur":5,"text":"taking place, we know they should sum zero.\nSo we're going to use W for the weights, and"},"1885":{"dur":4,"text":"the loads, and we're going to use R for the\nreactive forces going up. So let's sum them"},"1889":{"dur":4,"text":"all up and then we'll isolate and we'll figure\nout what it is. So we first have the reactive"},"1894":{"dur":2,"text":"force of the shoulder, but we're going to\npretend we don't know that. So let's do reactive"},"1897":{"dur":7,"text":"force at the shoulder plus we have the weight\nhere, so the weight of the upper extremity,"},"1905":{"dur":9,"text":"plus we have the weight here at the elbow.\nPlus we have the reactive force at the elbow."},"1915":{"dur":8,"text":"Plus last one we have the weight of the upper\narm. And all these should equal and the forearm"},"1924":{"dur":4,"text":"and arm, and no sorry, this should be forearm\nand hand, let's just--it's not upper arm,"},"1928":{"dur":4,"text":"it's forearm and hand. And it should all equal\nzero. So let's put in the values, and then"},"1932":{"dur":7,"text":"we're going to isolate for this and then I'm\ngoing to show you the last stage in this problem."},"1940":{"dur":8,"text":"So. The weight of the upper extremity is negative\n20.6, the weight of the elbow is plus,"},"1948":{"dur":8,"text":"we're going to add, negative 15.8 plus we're going to add the reaction at the elbow, which is"},"1957":{"dur":8,"text":"positive 15.8, plus we're going to add the\nweight of the forearm and hand, which is negative"},"1965":{"dur":7,"text":"15.8. So when we isolate for it, we're going\nto end up with the reaction at the shoulder"},"1973":{"dur":5,"text":"equals, and we're going to take all of these\nover. And you can see that these ones are"},"1978":{"dur":5,"text":"going to balance out and cancel each other\nout, so but I'll let you figure out and we'll"},"1983":{"dur":9,"text":"do it, so we'll do 20.6, because it's negative,\nwe're taking over positive, plus 15.8, minus"},"1993":{"dur":12,"text":"15.8, plus 15.8. And we add all of those together,\nyou get a reaction force of 36.4 newtons."},"2006":{"dur":3,"text":"So that is how we got that value. You were\ngiven it on your free body diagram, but I"},"2009":{"dur":4,"text":"just want to show you how you add all those\nforces up. So we have this reaction force"},"2014":{"dur":5,"text":"of 36.4, when we held it down we had a reaction\nforce at the elbow of 15.8, so again it shows"},"2020":{"dur":4,"text":"you how much more strain happens when you\nmake the lever longer, when you make it higher"},"2024":{"dur":4,"text":"and different things. So if you have to work\nat this, let's use the principle that we learnt"},"2029":{"dur":3,"text":"when we were talking about the forearm and\nhand, and we lowered it by 20 degrees and"},"2032":{"dur":6,"text":"we decreased the force that was happening\nat the shoulder. So pretend that I tell you,"},"2039":{"dur":7,"text":"in your very last thing, that you are to hold\nthe load 20 degrees below horizontal. So you"},"2046":{"dur":3,"text":"are no longer holding it right at 90 degrees\nat the shoulder. Now we're pretending that"},"2050":{"dur":5,"text":"we're holding the load at 20 degrees below\nhorizontal. So if you remember from before,"},"2055":{"dur":5,"text":"all you need to do is take the torque that\nyou found and multiply it by a cosine of 20."},"2061":{"dur":3,"text":"You don't have to go through, you could do\nit in each one, cosine of 20 of this one,"},"2065":{"dur":4,"text":"cosine of 20 of that one, cosine of 20 of\nthat one, that one, that one, you could do--that"},"2070":{"dur":3,"text":"one, you could them all. All the torques,\nand you could figure it out. But really once"},"2074":{"dur":3,"text":"we've figured out the final one, all we need\nto do is do it, and you add them all up, it"},"2077":{"dur":3,"text":"would come up to the same value if you did\nit on the final one. Okay so when we're looking"},"2081":{"dur":3,"text":"at figuring out this, we want to go to our\ncosine chart, and when you look down, again"},"2084":{"dur":5,"text":"at 20 degrees, we know if we multiply the\ntorque that we figured out by this cosine"},"2090":{"dur":5,"text":"value, we'll have the new torque at 20 degrees\nbelow. So our torque here is--I'm going to"},"2096":{"dur":6,"text":"go right down here and finish off everything\ndown here--our torque is 10.6. So it's 10.6"},"2103":{"dur":6,"text":"newton metres, and our cosine value that we\nfigured out before is .9397. So let's multiply"},"2109":{"dur":8,"text":".9397 times this 10.6 newton metres, so that's\n20 degrees below horizontal, and what we're"},"2117":{"dur":5,"text":"going to end up with is our new torque, and\nour new torque value is"},"2127":{"dur":2,"text":"9.96 newton metres."},"2131":{"dur":5,"text":"So you can see just by holding it, it's not\nas drastic as it was at the elbow when you"},"2137":{"dur":4,"text":"lowered it.
