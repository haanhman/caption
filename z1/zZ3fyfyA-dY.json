time"},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"we had talked, the Carneiro\nproject was front and center."},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'll talk just\nvery briefly about how"},"442":{"dur":1,"text":"I got from one to the other."},"443":{"dur":1,"text":"But the book manuscript\nI'm working on right"},"445":{"dur":4,"text":"now is-- this is the title of\nthe actual book manuscript."},"450":{"dur":3,"text":"But it's really sort of\nin its initial stages."},"453":{"dur":4,"text":"And so I explore-- I'm\nassuming most of you,"},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"maybe not all of you,\nknow who Zumbi is."},"460":{"dur":3,"text":"So he was the last leader of\nBrazil's great 17th century"},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]."},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"And the way that he died has\nbeen speculation of debate"},"468":{"dur":3,"text":"and contention for centuries."},"471":{"dur":4,"text":"And one of the more famous\naccounts is depicted here."},"476":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is from\nabout 2007 or 2010."},"480":{"dur":0,"text":"I forgot."},"481":{"dur":1,"text":"There was a graphic\nnovel depiction"},"482":{"dur":3,"text":"of Jorge Amado's Jubiaba,\nthis great proletarian novel"},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"from the 1930s."},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"And Zumbi appears in the novel."},"490":{"dur":3,"text":"But this is a\npictorial depiction."},"493":{"dur":3,"text":"And so the blacks, not\nwanting to be slaves anymore,"},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"when they saw that\nall was lost, Zumbi"},"499":{"dur":6,"text":"threw himself from the hill and\nall the others followed him."},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"And so this is this very\nlong-standing account"},"508":{"dur":3,"text":"of how Palmares ended and\nhow Zumbi died was suicide."},"512":{"dur":3,"text":"They saw all that was\nlost-- they saw all was lost"},"515":{"dur":1,"text":"and they decided to kill\nthemselves rather than"},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"return to slavery."},"519":{"dur":7,"text":"Now it's been dis-proven\nfor many years"},"527":{"dur":4,"text":"that this was actually\nhow the story ended."},"531":{"dur":4,"text":"But this version, as we can\nsee from a recent depiction,"},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"it's not something\nthat's died altogether."},"538":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's always\ninterested me why"},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"people invest meaning\nand commitment"},"544":{"dur":3,"text":"in the actual suicide story,\nand then why for others it's"},"547":{"dur":1,"text":"important to disprove it."},"548":{"dur":3,"text":"And so this is where,\njust to talk briefly,"},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"where the two projects\nsort of come together"},"554":{"dur":1,"text":"and where one came\nfrom the other."},"555":{"dur":3,"text":"So I was doing this project on\nCarneiro, who's pictured here,"},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"and his book O Quilombo dos\nPalmares, which came out"},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"in the 1940s right after\nVargas stepped down"},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"from power for the first time."},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"And in this book, this is like\nremains a classic on Palmares,"},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"he really insists-- Carneiro\nis like, he, Zumbi, did not"},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"And it is very\nimportant to know that."},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"And he-- there are a lot\nof interesting meanings"},"578":{"dur":4,"text":"I think that have to do\nwith self-governance,"},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"things going through the\nCommunist party with race"},"584":{"dur":1,"text":"at that time."},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"But there are many--\nbut it's really"},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"an important point to him."},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"And I really became\nfixated on it."},"591":{"dur":1,"text":"Why is it so important?"},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"And I didn't know\nthe whole history"},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"that there was this debate."},"595":{"dur":1,"text":"But I could tell from\nCarneiro's book--"},"597":{"dur":3,"text":"this was at the very beginning--\nit's very important to him"},"600":{"dur":3,"text":"to show that Zumbi did\nnot commit suicide."},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that is really\nthe seed of what"},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"now has become this\nbook that is trying"},"608":{"dur":3,"text":"to trace meanings\nattached to Zumbi's death"},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"over three centuries."},"614":{"dur":7,"text":"And what I'm going to talk\nabout today is especially"},"622":{"dur":1,"text":"in progress, I'll say."},"623":{"dur":1,"text":"And so I'm really\nlooking forward"},"625":{"dur":3,"text":"to having comments and\ncritiques and questions."},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"This is probably going\nto be the third chapter."},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"And it is concerned\nprimarily with linguistic,"},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"discursive, and\nmetaphorical death,"},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"and the lines, as we'll\nsee, between the human"},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"and the supernatural and\nbetween the living and the dead."},"642":{"dur":3,"text":"And I want to start off I\nthink just to orient people,"},"645":{"dur":3,"text":"even for folks who are very\nwell-versed in Brazilian"},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"history and who are even\nBrazilian, I think there's"},"650":{"dur":1,"text":"a few words, because\nwe're going to be"},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"going back and forth a little\nbit between Africa and Brazil."},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"There's a few words that I want\nto just put out there and give"},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"basic definitions of."},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"So the first one is\nZumbi dos Palmares."},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is Zumbi\nwith a capital Z."},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the person who\nwe've been talking about,"},"668":{"dur":1,"text":"the last leader of Palmares."},"669":{"dur":1,"text":"The second word is\nzumbi, and you'll"},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"see here with lowercase z."},"673":{"dur":1,"text":"And so in Central\nand West Africa,"},"675":{"dur":3,"text":"and as we'll see, also in\nBrazil, zumbi with lowercase z"},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"has many different\nmeanings, but the basic one"},"681":{"dur":3,"text":"is soul of the deceased,\na spirit, sometimes used"},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"as like an affliction."},"686":{"dur":1,"text":"This is something that\nthe next-- this one"},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"you don't have to\nworry about too much,"},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"but it will come\nup a little bit."},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"Ganga zumbi, or gangas--\nthese are religious mediums"},"694":{"dur":0,"text":"or authorities."},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"And they would be\nable to, in Brazil"},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"and in Angola,\nprincipally, who would"},"701":{"dur":4,"text":"be able to just sort of\nput a zumbi on someone,"},"705":{"dur":4,"text":"or more often, heal someone\nwho is afflicted by a zumbi."},"710":{"dur":5,"text":"And then finally, Zambi\nand N'gana Zambi, and this"},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"is a supreme being,\ngodlike figure."},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"And you don't need\nto memorize these."},"720":{"dur":2,"text":"I think the thing\nwe're going to focus on"},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"is the difference between\ncapital Z and lowercase z"},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"zumbi, and also Zambi,\none of the main sort"},"728":{"dur":3,"text":"of etymological roots of this\nis a lot of people in Brazil"},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"will say that Zumbi really,\nhis real name was Zambi,"},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"and that this was a,\ndepending on who you ask,"},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"this was an error that\nslaves or former slaves"},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"sort of forgot their culture\nor historians since then"},"742":{"dur":1,"text":"have made a misspelling."},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"So they really divided\nthese three things-- Zambi,"},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"Zumbi with a capital\nZ, and lowercase z."},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"And so what I\nreally want to do is"},"751":{"dur":3,"text":"think about what happens\nwhen we don't understand"},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"these lines being as fixed,\nas people Nino Rodriguez,"},"757":{"dur":3,"text":"Camara Cascudo, very\ninfluential scholars,"},"760":{"dur":1,"text":"have really made the division."},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"So what happens if we\nsort of question, one,"},"764":{"dur":1,"text":"why they made those\ndivisions, and two,"},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"what happens when we think\nabout things more fluidly."},"770":{"dur":2,"text":"And again, this will be\nreally the principal kind"},"772":{"dur":4,"text":"of difference between\nupper and lower case."},"776":{"dur":5,"text":"And one more point is\njust that the separation"},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"between these two things\noften also involves"},"785":{"dur":3,"text":"drawing an indelible line\nbetween Africa and Brazil."},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"And so zumbi with\nlowercase z, this"},"791":{"dur":2,"text":"is something that\nhappened in Africa."},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"When we get to Brazil, we sort\nof lost track of all this."},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is a fetish is the word\npeople are going to use a lot."},"798":{"dur":3,"text":"This is not only a non-Christian\nthing, the meaning in Brazil,"},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"but it's also not even\ntrue to African roots."},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"So zumbi with the\nlowercase z in Brazil"},"808":{"dur":2,"text":"is often understood\nto be sort of severed"},"810":{"dur":5,"text":"from both Zumbi the person\nand African zumbi, the souls."},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"So again, I'll be going--\nit may be confusing,"},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"but I'll try and hit\nback into this a lot"},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"and will hopefully\nkeep things straight."},"823":{"dur":4,"text":"I want to start off-- so how I\ngot on to this specific piece."},"828":{"dur":2,"text":"I really started\nthinking about things"},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"when I came across two\nvery interesting cases"},"832":{"dur":1,"text":"from either side\nof the Atlantic."},"833":{"dur":2,"text":"And I've been guided so far\nby this really wonderful quote"},"836":{"dur":1,"text":"by Maya Angelou."},"837":{"dur":1,"text":"\"A bird doesn't sing\nbecause it has an answer,"},"839":{"dur":1,"text":"it sings because it has a song.\""},"840":{"dur":7,"text":"And we'll see sort of what that\nmeans in just a little bit."},"848":{"dur":2,"text":"The basic point is\nthat I'm not searching"},"850":{"dur":3,"text":"here for like a definitive\netymological linguistic origin"},"854":{"dur":1,"text":"of the word zumbi."},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"Lots of people have\ndone that, and I"},"857":{"dur":1,"text":"think it's probably\nan impossible task,"},"859":{"dur":1,"text":"but also I don't think\nit's as fruitful as what"},"861":{"dur":1,"text":"do we think about when\nwe're not looking just"},"862":{"dur":1,"text":"for a precise answer\nabout this one word,"},"864":{"dur":4,"text":"but a larger symphony\nmeaning, if you will."},"869":{"dur":1,"text":"So two references."},"870":{"dur":4,"text":"So the first one\ncomes from Angola."},"874":{"dur":3,"text":"And both these\nreferences, I should say,"},"878":{"dur":1,"text":"are from the early 1880s."},"879":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is a unique moment of\nthinking about these things."},"882":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'll talk about that a bit."},"884":{"dur":4,"text":"So in 1881 the Portuguese Naval\nofficers Hermenegildo Cappello"},"888":{"dur":1,"text":"and Roberto Ivans,\nthey published"},"890":{"dur":1,"text":"this account of an\nexpedition they'd"},"891":{"dur":1,"text":"taken recently in Angola."},"893":{"dur":4,"text":"And at one stop in the\nvoyage, some 700 kilometers"},"897":{"dur":3,"text":"from the coast, they\nencountered a man"},"900":{"dur":1,"text":"who showed them a\nwooden object made"},"902":{"dur":1,"text":"to look like a small chapel."},"904":{"dur":2,"text":"And on the inside,\nand I'm quoting here,"},"906":{"dur":1,"text":"\"there was a small\nfigure representing"},"908":{"dur":3,"text":"a man with outstretched\narms and another above that"},"912":{"dur":4,"text":"looked like a small bird\nsaid to be the N'gana Zambi.\""},"916":{"dur":2,"text":"Now Cappello and Ivans\ntext like immediately"},"919":{"dur":2,"text":"became a point of\nreference for Brazilians"},"921":{"dur":1,"text":"who were interested in\ntracing African origins"},"923":{"dur":1,"text":"of local languages and customs."},"925":{"dur":3,"text":"And this specific reference\nto N'gana Zambi has often been"},"929":{"dur":2,"text":"called upon as evidence\nthat Zumbi dos Palmares,"},"931":{"dur":1,"text":"his real name, he\nreally was Zambi,"},"933":{"dur":1,"text":"and this was sort\nof a corruption"},"935":{"dur":5,"text":"of [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] that\nhad been confused over time."},"940":{"dur":2,"text":"But for all the times that this\nspecific reference to N'gana"},"943":{"dur":4,"text":"Zambi has been cited,\nthere's two important details"},"947":{"dur":3,"text":"that have received little\nor perhaps no attention."},"950":{"dur":2,"text":"So first, there is the\npresence of this bird."},"953":{"dur":3,"text":"And Cappello and Ivans actually\nsay that in inter local tour"},"956":{"dur":2,"text":"said that the N'gana Zambi\nis the bird, not the man."},"959":{"dur":2,"text":"It's the bird above."},"962":{"dur":2,"text":"But Cappello and Ivans, like\nmany travelers at the time,"},"964":{"dur":2,"text":"they seem much more\ninterested in sort of saying,"},"967":{"dur":4,"text":"oh, well these Africans are\nbackwards and more interested"},"971":{"dur":1,"text":"in the idea of a\nhuman-like deity."},"972":{"dur":3,"text":"So on the very next page they\nsay, well, in fact, one of us,"},"976":{"dur":2,"text":"it was
