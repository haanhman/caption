{"7":{"dur":3,"text":"Welcome to the second part of this three-part lecture"},"11":{"dur":3,"text":"series that I'll be giving on telomeres and telomerase. In"},"14":{"dur":3,"text":"part two, I'm going to discuss telomeres and telomerase in"},"18":{"dur":4,"text":"human cells, and particularly I'm going to emphasize the"},"22":{"dur":4,"text":"setting of cancer cells. Now you may recall from the first"},"27":{"dur":4,"text":"lecture that the function of telomerase is to maintain the"},"31":{"dur":4,"text":"telomeres and prevent them from shortening as cells"},"36":{"dur":2,"text":"divide, because telomere shortening would otherwise"},"39":{"dur":3,"text":"occur in the absence of telomerase, to compensate for"},"42":{"dur":4,"text":"the shortening processes. And so, maintaining telomeres"},"46":{"dur":7,"text":"allows the cells to keep on dividing. In human cells, we"},"54":{"dur":4,"text":"can also see though that telomerase itself is protecting"},"58":{"dur":2,"text":"telomeres, and so I want to show you one kind of"},"61":{"dur":6,"text":"experiment for that. And the conclusion is going to be that"},"68":{"dur":3,"text":"it's not just the bulk telomere length that matters, but the"},"71":{"dur":3,"text":"presence of telomerase can determine whether a"},"75":{"dur":6,"text":"telomere is seen by the cell as sufficiently long or not. The"},"81":{"dur":3,"text":"experiment I'll show you was done in cultured human"},"85":{"dur":3,"text":"cells. These were not cancer cells, and these were cells"},"88":{"dur":2,"text":"that have normally extremely, extremely low levels of"},"91":{"dur":3,"text":"telomerase, effectively, for our purposes, essentially no"},"95":{"dur":2,"text":"measurable telomerase activity, and certainly their"},"97":{"dur":3,"text":"telomeres are not maintained. Now I've shown you in very"},"100":{"dur":3,"text":"simple diagrammatic form human telomerase, so this"},"104":{"dur":3,"text":"would be the template sequence of the human"},"107":{"dur":5,"text":"telomerase RNA, and this is the overhanging G-rich"},"113":{"dur":3,"text":"strand. It's actually usually longer than this, but I've just"},"116":{"dur":3,"text":"shown it as a simple diagrammatic form here. And this of"},"120":{"dur":5,"text":"course is the duplex telomeric DNA that will be consisting"},"126":{"dur":2,"text":"of hundreds or thousands of telomeric repeats, as you go"},"129":{"dur":4,"text":"in toward the chromosome interior. And just as I showed"},"134":{"dur":3,"text":"you for Tetrahymena telomerase, the template region is"},"137":{"dur":4,"text":"copied, and so the DNA... for example, a DNA with three"},"142":{"dur":2,"text":"Gs, two Ts, and an A, would sit down here on the"},"145":{"dur":2,"text":"template, and then nucleotides would added, extending"},"148":{"dur":5,"text":"along the template, thereby lengthening the DNA in this"},"154":{"dur":5,"text":"reverse transcriptase reaction that telomerase carries out."},"159":{"dur":4,"text":"So what was done was to compare cells in which"},"163":{"dur":5,"text":"telomerase was being expressed or not being expressed,"},"169":{"dur":3,"text":"and look at the growth of the cells and the telomere"},"172":{"dur":4,"text":"length. Now the protein TERT is the core protein that has"},"177":{"dur":4,"text":"this enzymatic activity: the reverse transcriptase activity,"},"181":{"dur":5,"text":"and probably other activities, as I will allude to. And so, in"},"186":{"dur":4,"text":"these experiments, a particular mutation was made on the"},"191":{"dur":2,"text":"TERT protein, it happened to be a very small change of a"},"193":{"dur":5,"text":"few amino acids added to the very C-terminus, and what"},"198":{"dur":3,"text":"this does is it doesn't affect the enzymatic activity, but it"},"202":{"dur":4,"text":"does affect the ability of this enzyme to elongate"},"207":{"dur":5,"text":"telomeres in cells, and it's called a hypomorph because"},"212":{"dur":5,"text":"that refers to the fact that it has an insufficient function,"},"217":{"dur":3,"text":"but it showed something useful. Now here's the"},"220":{"dur":2,"text":"experiment, and I'm going to walk you through this rather"},"223":{"dur":3,"text":"complex-looking slide. First of all, I want to show you a"},"227":{"dur":3,"text":"growth curve of human fibroblasts in culture. What"},"231":{"dur":3,"text":"normally happens is, if we look at the... this is cumulative"},"235":{"dur":2,"text":"dilutions, which is just an operational term telling you how"},"237":{"dur":2,"text":"many cell divisions are going on, and this is the number of"},"240":{"dur":3,"text":"days. So if you culture human fibroblasts, normally what"},"244":{"dur":3,"text":"you find is that the cells will continue to multiply for a"},"248":{"dur":3,"text":"while, and then they'll cease multiplying any further, so the"},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"curve flattens out, so you see they've undergone"},"254":{"dur":4,"text":"something like 50 or so divisions. And if you put in a"},"259":{"dur":3,"text":"control vector, which would be important, you get the"},"262":{"dur":4,"text":"same curve. But if you put in the test vector, which"},"266":{"dur":4,"text":"actually is expressing this form of the human telomerase"},"271":{"dur":4,"text":"core protein TERT, because the fibroblast cells naturally"},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"have enough telomerase RNA and the other components"},"278":{"dur":2,"text":"of telomerase, all they're missing is the TERT, you just"},"280":{"dur":3,"text":"have to add this in, and now you can restore telomerase"},"284":{"dur":3,"text":"activity. But what's very interesting is the telomeres and"},"287":{"dur":3,"text":"the cell growth. What you can see is, first of all, the cell"},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"growth has been greatly extended. We've now made"},"294":{"dur":4,"text":"these cells very much elongated in their lifespan"},"299":{"dur":4,"text":"compared with the controls or the parental cells. Now let's"},"303":{"dur":4,"text":"look at the telomeres. If we look at the telomeres in these"},"307":{"dur":4,"text":"cells, the controls, we find that they're gradually becoming"},"312":{"dur":3,"text":"somewhat shorter, and at this point here, they've pretty"},"315":{"dur":3,"text":"much ceased to divide, so we're out here, they pretty"},"318":{"dur":3,"text":"much cease dividing. So the telomeres on average are"},"321":{"dur":3,"text":"about this long, and the cells have picked up the signal,"},"324":{"dur":3,"text":"they've said the telomere length is shorter here than here,"},"328":{"dur":1,"text":"and they've picked up the signal, and they've said we're"},"329":{"dur":3,"text":"not going to divide any further. Now we've added the"},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"hTERT. Now actually what happened was that, I told you"},"335":{"dur":3,"text":"the cells continue to grow a long, long time. The"},"339":{"dur":4,"text":"telomeres shorten, and then they steady out at some"},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"much shorter length, so through here and through here,"},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"they're actually growing quite well, but they're going with"},"348":{"dur":6,"text":"much shorter telomeres. So in other words, these cells"},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"can keep dividing for a long time with very short"},"358":{"dur":3,"text":"telomeres, and the difference was they had telomerase"},"362":{"dur":4,"text":"being expressed. So we used a trick just to separate out"},"366":{"dur":3,"text":"the telomere lengthening property of telomerase from its"},"370":{"dur":3,"text":"ability to stabilize telomeres, and we saw that in fact if you"},"373":{"dur":3,"text":"have this telomerase present throughout, even though"},"377":{"dur":4,"text":"the telomeres maintain short, they are perfectly stable,"},"381":{"dur":4,"text":"and the cells can keep dividing. So this is the second"},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"piece of evidence, I showed you the first piece of"},"389":{"dur":4,"text":"evidence for you in yeast systems in the first part of this"},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"lecture series, and now this is the second piece of"},"395":{"dur":3,"text":"evidence that telomerase is having a protective function,"},"399":{"dur":3,"text":"in this case, it's in human cells, and it's stabilizing"},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"telomeres that otherwise would've been too short in its"},"405":{"dur":3,"text":"absence. This is not unique to human cells, it's been seen"},"408":{"dur":5,"text":"in yeast systems as well experimentally. So I just talked to"},"414":{"dur":4,"text":"you about normal cells, and I told you that, in those"},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"human fibroblasts grown in culture, there's very little"},"421":{"dur":8,"text":"telomerase. So, now let's talk about where do we normally"},"430":{"dur":10,"text":"find telomerase in human cells? Well, if you look in cells,"},"440":{"dur":3,"text":"you find that it actually is on at times when the cells are"},"443":{"dur":3,"text":"greatly proliferating during fetal development, and it does"},"446":{"dur":4,"text":"remain active in certain proliferative cells. It's also found"},"451":{"dur":4,"text":"active in stem cells, in cells that are activated to"},"455":{"dur":5,"text":"proliferate, such as lymphocytes proliferating under the"},"461":{"dur":5,"text":"response to, for example, a pathogen. One finds stem"},"467":{"dur":4,"text":"cells, for example, in hair follicles; those have telomerase."},"471":{"dur":3,"text":"So one does find telomerase in cells that are stem cells"},"474":{"dur":7,"text":"and various sorts of cells that are induced to proliferate."},"482":{"dur":4,"text":"And in fact in most other cells, one can find telomerase,"},"486":{"dur":3,"text":"but it's in very low levels. So initially people thought there"},"490":{"dur":3,"text":"was no telomerase in normal epithelial cells or fibroblasts"},"493":{"dur":4,"text":"or endothelial cells, but closer scrutiny showed that in fact"},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"there were real, definitely low and very downregulated,"},"501":{"dur":7,"text":"but real levels of telomerase. And in the third part of this"},"509":{"dur":5,"text":"three-lecture series, I will talk more about the telomerase"},"514":{"dur":5,"text":"in the normal cells of people and tell you about some in"},"520":{"dur":5,"text":"vivo studies that have been done. Now, cancer cells."},"525":{"dur":4,"text":"Cancer cells are infamous for their ability to keep on"},"530":{"dur":4,"text":"multiplying. Now, they can do this for a variety of different"},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"reasons. They lose their system of checks and balances"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"that prevent them from overmultiplying, and that's"},"541":{"dur":3,"text":"because of a lot of genetic and epigenetic changes that"},"544":{"dur":3,"text":"have taken place in their progression to become a"},"548":{"dur":5,"text":"malignant cancer cell. Now, they are immortal cells, and"},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"indeed, as you might expect, telomerase is on in these"},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"cells, and in fact it's very high in the vast majority of"},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"human cancers, particularly as they've got to the invasive"},"563":{"dur":4,"text":"stages. And that makes a lot of sense based on what I"},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"just told you, because if the cells are to keep on"},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"multiplying, then they have to keep on replenishing their"},"574":{"dur":4,"text":"telomeres. Now I'll you some more recent results in the"},"578":{"dur":3,"text":"last few years, which also suggest telomerase may be"},"582":{"dur":3,"text":"doing other things in human cancer cells. It is certainly"},"586":{"dur":3,"text":"maintaining the telomeres, and that is important, but there"},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"may be other functions as well. So I'll tell you some newer"},"592":{"dur":5,"text":"findings about that. So, let's just recapitulate what I said"},"598":{"dur":3,"text":"about where we find telomerase in humans. So it keeps"},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"telomeres elongating and replenished, and therefore cells"},"604":{"dur":5,"text":"can keep dividing in stem cells and, of course, I didn't"},"610":{"dur":3,"text":"mention germ cells. Now of course we wouldn't be here if"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"we didn't have maintenance of telomeres from generation"},"616":{"dur":4,"text":"to generation. Telomerase indeed is active in germ cells,"},"620":{"dur":3,"text":"as well as stem cells of various kinds. As I said, it's"},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"detectable in many normal cell types, and highly active in"},"627":{"dur":5,"text":"the great majority of human cancers. And by the way, in"},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"some of those human cancers in which you don't find the"},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"high telomerase, one actually often finds this ALT"},"639":{"dur":4,"text":"mechanism, but it's only a particular subset of cancers in"},"643":{"dur":4,"text":"which one finds ALT being a prominent means of"},"647":{"dur":3,"text":"maintaining telomeres. The great majority of the common"},"650":{"dur":5,"text":"human tumors have highly active telomerase. So,"},"656":{"dur":6,"text":"telomerase is highly active in human tumors. So one could"},"662":{"dur":4,"text":"imagine inhibiting telomerase, and this might be a good"},"667":{"dur":4,"text":"target for trying to inhibit the growth of cancer cells, if you"},"672":{"dur":4,"text":"could inhibit telomerase in cancer cells. And so in"},"677":{"dur":4,"text":"investigating this, some interesting things emerged. So"},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"let's just think about what is expected to happen if you"},"684":{"dur":3,"text":"don't have telomerase in the cancer cells. Well, as you"},"687":{"dur":3,"text":"know, cells multiply, and their telomeres will progressively"},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"become shorter and shorter if there isn't telomerase to"},"693":{"dur":3,"text":"counteract that shortening, and so eventually when the"},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"telomeres get too short, the cells would eventually cease"},"700":{"dur":5,"text":"to divide, and the cells respond to those short telomeres"},"705":{"dur":3,"text":"by either what's call the \"senescence response,\" in which"},"709":{"dur":4,"text":"the cells simply won't replicate their DNA anymore, or a"},"713":{"dur":3,"text":"cell death response that can include an apoptotic"},"716":{"dur":4,"text":"response, which involves an active cell suicide program"},"721":{"dur":4,"text":"that can be induced by dysfunctional telomeres. Whether"},"725":{"dur":3,"text":"it's senescence or cell death does depend upon the cell"},"729":{"dur":4,"text":"type. So, the simple prediction, diagrammatically, would"},"734":{"dur":4,"text":"be, if you didn't have telomerase, the cells now would"},"738":{"dur":2,"text":"have shorter and shorter telomeres, and after some"},"740":{"dur":6,"text":"number of divisions, eventually there would be cell death."},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"Without telomerase, it's been observed experimentally,"},"750":{"dur":4,"text":"typically human cells lose their telomeric DNA at this kind"},"754":{"dur":4,"text":"of rate. I've put 150-200 base pairs per cell division; that's"},"759":{"dur":5,"text":"seen in a number of cultured cells and also in some"},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"cancer cells in which telomerase has been inhibited."},"768":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, I told you that human telomeres are typically made"},"773":{"dur":6,"text":"of hundreds, even thousands, of copies of telomeric"},"779":{"dur":3,"text":"repeats, they're thousands of base pairs long, so at this"},"782":{"dur":3,"text":"rate, it's going to take quite a lot of cell divisions before"},"786":{"dur":3,"text":"the telomere gets short enough that the cells will have this"},"789":{"dur":5,"text":"response. So that in fact is the prediction, and if you"},"795":{"dur":3,"text":"inhibit the telomerase enzyme using, for example, a small"},"799":{"dur":4,"text":"molecule inhibitor that inhibits the catalytic function of"},"804":{"dur":4,"text":"telomerase that prevents it from carrying out that DNA"},"808":{"dur":3,"text":"polymerase reaction by the reverse transcriptase"},"811":{"dur":3,"text":"mechanism, if you inhibit telomerase in such a way,"},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"indeed this is the observation. There's a gradual"},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"shortening of telomeres, and eventually the cells cease to"},"821":{"dur":3,"text":"divide. So this is seen in cancer cells in culture treated"},"824":{"dur":6,"text":"with such an inhibitor. Now I've put a noted point up here:"},"830":{"dur":4,"text":"but you're still keeping the telomerase ribonucleoprotein"},"835":{"dur":5,"text":"(RNP) level high. You're not depleting the cells of the"},"840":{"dur":7,"text":"enzyme, you are simply rendering that enzyme inactive."},"847":{"dur":3,"text":"And I make that distinction because of the next results I"},"850":{"dur":6,"text":"want to tell you about. So, what was observed was quite"},"857":{"dur":4,"text":"surprising. If one depleted telomerase, and the particular"},"862":{"dur":4,"text":"way to knock the telomerase RNA down, then one found"},"866":{"dur":4,"text":"there was a very rapid effect on human cancer cells. One"},"870":{"dur":6,"text":"didn't see the long delay ensuing before the effect was"},"877":{"dur":5,"text":"observed. So, now I'll tell you about those experiments."},"882":{"dur":2,"text":"So, reminding you again, here's human telomerase, it's"},"885":{"dur":5,"text":"copying its RNA template, and of course the enzyme has"},"890":{"dur":3,"text":"the TERT protein and the telomerase RNA, and it's the"},"894":{"dur":5,"text":"RNA that is going to be depleted in these experiments."},"899":{"dur":3,"text":"How's the RNA depleted? A now commonly used"},"902":{"dur":3,"text":"technique, which is called a knockdown using RNA"},"906":{"dur":4,"text":"interference. Now the particular technique was to express"},"911":{"dur":4,"text":"from a lentiviral vector, which you can introduce efficiently"},"916":{"dur":5,"text":"into cells, a particular sequence which forms a double-"},"921":{"dur":2,"text":"stranded RNA, and I've just shown the corresponding"},"923":{"dur":3,"text":"DNA sequence here, and that double-stranded RNA can"},"927":{"dur":4,"text":"interact with a cellular RNA that matches its sequence,"},"932":{"dur":4,"text":"and eventually cause the breakdown of that RNA"},"937":{"dur":2,"text":"through a complicated process known as RNA"},"939":{"dur":5,"text":"interference. And so, siRNA refers to \"short interfering"},"944":{"dur":4,"text":"RNA,\" because such a short interfering RNA, which"},"949":{"dur":4,"text":"involves introducing two strands of RNA complementary"},"953":{"dur":4,"text":"to the target RNA, that is what causes the breakdown to"},"958":{"dur":3,"text":"occur. Now when we did this experiment, so here's a"},"961":{"dur":2,"text":"control where we're looking at a reference amount, here's"},"964":{"dur":4,"text":"the telomerase RNA, one found that in fact the method of"},"969":{"dur":4,"text":"introducing such a short interfering RNA by this kind of"},"974":{"dur":3,"text":"construct here (the details don't matter), one could in fact"},"978":{"dur":4,"text":"quite efficiently knock down the telomerase RNA in"},"982":{"dur":3,"text":"human cancer cells grown in culture, for example, in"},"985":{"dur":4,"text":"these breast cancer cells grown in culture. And so one"},"990":{"dur":6,"text":"could knock it down almost down to about 10-12% of the"},"996":{"dur":5,"text":"original level that one sees in the controls. So what"},"1001":{"dur":5,"text":"happens then? Now, if what I had told you was the case,"},"1007":{"dur":2,"text":"that we knock down the telomerase, then we would"},"1009":{"dur":3,"text":"expect to have to wait for a long time for the telomeres to"},"1013":{"dur":3,"text":"get short enough, if that were the only thing going on,"},"1017":{"dur":2,"text":"then we would have to wait before we saw any effect."},"1019":{"dur":3,"text":"But right away, there was an effect on the growth of the"},"1022":{"dur":5,"text":"cells. Now just to put this into perspective here, I'll just"},"1027":{"dur":2,"text":"walk you through a couple of graphs. Here's the controls"},"1030":{"dur":4,"text":"of two kinds, and this is the number of cells here. And so"},"1034":{"dur":2,"text":"what you can see is that the cell number goes up and up"},"1037":{"dur":5,"text":"and up, as you might expect. The cells are dividing once"},"1042":{"dur":3,"text":"every day or two, and so you can see, after about four or"},"1045":{"dur":4,"text":"five days after the introduction of the construct that"},"1049":{"dur":4,"text":"knocked the telomerase RNA level down, that the cells"},"1054":{"dur":5,"text":"that received this are quite quickly growing more slowly"},"1060":{"dur":3,"text":"than the controls. So this must be occurring within a"},"1063":{"dur":3,"text":"couple of cell divisions. And here are some more controls"},"1067":{"dur":5,"text":"in which, here's the empty vector, here is the short"},"1072":{"dur":3,"text":"interfering RNA targeting telomerase RNA, and here's a"},"1076":{"dur":4,"text":"control version of that, in which it now no longer can"},"1080":{"dur":2,"text":"target the telomerase RNA, but everything else is the"},"1083":{"dur":2,"text":"same, and as you can see it behaves like the controls."},"1086":{"dur":3,"text":"And so a great many control experiments were done to"},"1089":{"dur":3,"text":"show that this was a specific effect specific to knocking"},"1093":{"dur":6,"text":"down the telomerase RNA. This was done on bulk,"},"1100":{"dur":6,"text":"unselected cell populations. The cells were a melanoma"},"1107":{"dur":4,"text":"cell line that normally has very long telomeres. The bulk,"},"1112":{"dur":4,"text":"unselected populations is significant because what it"},"1116":{"dur":4,"text":"meant was that one could put the siRNA, the agent that"},"1121":{"dur":4,"text":"knocks the telomerase RNA down, into the cells at day"},"1125":{"dur":5,"text":"zero, and without even any selection, one could get"},"1131":{"dur":3,"text":"something like 80-90% of the cells that received this"},"1134":{"dur":3,"text":"construct, and in fact the ones that did grow out were"},"1137":{"dur":3,"text":"that low percentage that didn't receive the construct. So"},"1141":{"dur":3,"text":"in fact the effect is even stronger than what these curves"},"1145":{"dur":3,"text":"would indicate, because these ones that are growing out"},"1149":{"dur":7,"text":"are largely the ones that just didn't receive the construct."},"1157":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, one of the things that is very important in human"},"1161":{"dur":4,"text":"cells to respond to DNA damage such as certain kinds of"},"1166":{"dur":6,"text":"telomeric DNA damage is the gene p53.

So this is a different response from a classic DNA"},"1205":{"dur":3,"text":"damage response, and in fact we did not see DNA"},"1208":{"dur":5,"text":"damage response genes being induced here. We looked"},"1214":{"dur":7,"text":"at the telomeres by some molecular probing mechanisms"},"1221":{"dur":3,"text":"that allow one to see if the telomeres are uncapped, and"},"1225":{"dur":5,"text":"in fact they were not uncapped either.

That's not the"},"1261":{"dur":3,"text":"cause of the growth inhibition of these human cancer"},"1264":{"dur":5,"text":"cells. But interesting things happen very quickly to these"},"1270":{"dur":4,"text":"cells when you knock down telomerase RNA. I'm going to"},"1275":{"dur":6,"text":"show you this one experiment in which, in this experiment,"},"1282":{"dur":3,"text":"melanoma cells were grown in culture, and the RNA level"},"1285":{"dur":3,"text":"was knocked down by a completely different mechanism,"},"1288":{"dur":7,"text":"it's called a \"ribozyme,\" and the purpose of it is to cleave"},"1296":{"dur":3,"text":"the telomerase RNA, causing it to break down, and so it"},"1299":{"dur":3,"text":"has exactly the same effect that I showed you for the"},"1303":{"dur":3,"text":"RNA interference: you knock down the telomerase RNA"},"1306":{"dur":5,"text":"level.
