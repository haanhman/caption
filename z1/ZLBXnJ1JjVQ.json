one of\ntheir main questions was to"},"463":{"dur":3,"text":"answer, was there water on Mars,\nand they definitely answered"},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"that, Mars was\nonce soaked in

that"},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"there is\nsignificant water on Mars,"},"535":{"dur":3,"text":"particularly towards the\nPolar Regions that there is"},"538":{"dur":0,"text":"significant water."},"539":{"dur":3,"text":"What we didn't know is\nhow that exists on Mars."},"542":{"dur":1,"text":"Is it large chunks of\nice under the surface,"},"544":{"dur":5,"text":"is it actually could be

surface."},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"So, that's a\nsignificant amount of water."},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"So, what we did then is we\ntook the Phoenix Lander."},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"So, now we knew\nthere was water there,"},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"but we didn't\nknow, as I mentioned,"},"582":{"dur":1,"text":"what form it was in, so we\nlaunched Phoenix and sent that"},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"to Mars and landed it\nin the Polar Region,"},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"and one of the things\nwe noticed right away,"},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"from one of the\nfirst images back,"},"591":{"dur":1,"text":"right after landing, this\nis underneath the lander,"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"you will see that the landing\nrocket sort of cleared away an"},"596":{"dur":3,"text":"area and there is this nice\nshiny smooth surface there."},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"So is that ice, what is that?"},"602":{"dur":4,"text":"So, we took the arm which has a\nshovel on the end of it outright"},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"the side of the lander and\ndug just a couple of inches in,"},"609":{"dur":4,"text":"and what you see here this white\narea is actually frozen

Mars."},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"But what we also found, which is\nhard to see in this bottom left"},"624":{"dur":3,"text":"corner, its blown up there, are\nthese other little chunks and"},"627":{"dur":3,"text":"then within a few hours of\nthat they actually disappeared,"},"631":{"dur":1,"text":"so the water sublimated."},"633":{"dur":3,"text":"So we dug later, brought\nthose up into our ovens and our"},"636":{"dur":5,"text":"sensors and we were able to\nprove that that water ice,"},"641":{"dur":3,"text":"very easy to get to\nwithin the surface of Mars."},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"So there is\nsignificant water on Mars."},"647":{"dur":3,"text":"It exists as ice within the soil\nas well as potentially deeper"},"650":{"dur":4,"text":"down it could be liquid\nwater, we don't know that yet,"},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"but there is\nsignificant water on Mars."},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"As I mentioned,\nwhat's the next decade?"},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"So we are moving from follow\nthe water to looking"},"663":{"dur":1,"text":"for the signs of life."},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's what our latest\nmission that you may have heard"},"668":{"dur":4,"text":"of the Mars Science Laboratory\nis part of that transition."},"672":{"dur":3,"text":"With the Mars Science Laboratory\nwe landed the Curiosity

on Mars\ntheir environments there,"},"695":{"dur":4,"text":"life as we know it here on\nEarth could have survived."},"699":{"dur":3,"text":"So, it looked at the\nconcentrations of carbon,"},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"hydrogen, nitrogen,\noxygen, phosphorus,"},"705":{"dur":3,"text":"and sulfur, they are all there\nin the right concentrations."},"708":{"dur":3,"text":"They also found, looked at the\nmineralogy and the clays that"},"711":{"dur":3,"text":"were found in that area and\nfound that there was significant"},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"fresh water actually, not\nvery salty water at all."},"717":{"dur":3,"text":"And in fact they believe if we\nhad been there we could have"},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"dipped a cup in the water and\ndrank it without any issue."},"723":{"dur":4,"text":"So Mars did have\nhabitable environments."},"728":{"dur":4,"text":"We do not know to be clear, we\ndo not know if life ever arose"},"732":{"dur":3,"text":"or currently may exist on Mars,\nbut we do we know that there"},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"used to environments\nwhere it could have."},"737":{"dur":6,"text":"So, Curiosity is the really\nthe monster truck of rovers."},"744":{"dur":1,"text":"If you look here these are the\nother rovers that we have sent"},"746":{"dur":3,"text":"to Mars, our very first one here\nwith path finder and then the"},"749":{"dur":4,"text":"Mars exploration rovers and then\nthe Mars Science Laboratory at"},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"about 1 metric ton."},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"And that 1 metric ton represents\nthe limits of our current entry,"},"760":{"dur":1,"text":"descent, and\nlanding capabilities."},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"So, this rover is the biggest\nthing that we know currently how"},"765":{"dur":1,"text":"to put down on the\nsurface of Mars,"},"767":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's based on significant\ntechnology investments that were"},"769":{"dur":5,"text":"made in the '60s and the\n'70s leading up to the Viking"},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"Missions, the Viking Program."},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"We humans have sent 40 missions\nto the surface"},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"of Mars from Earth.\nMany of those have failed."},"784":{"dur":2,"text":"It is a very hard place to go."},"786":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact if you\nare keeping score,"},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"we have had 16 successful\nmissions versus"},"791":{"dur":2,"text":"24 failures from Earth."},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"But since we are\ntalking about landers today,"},"796":{"dur":3,"text":"we have had seven successful\nlanders and we have had eight"},"799":{"dur":1,"text":"that have failed."},"801":{"dur":3,"text":"So, let's start talking about\nwhat it takes first to how do we"},"804":{"dur":1,"text":"get to Mars."},"805":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, you all had a presentation\non the Space Launch System,"},"808":{"dur":3,"text":"I believe it was last week,\nand so the first thing you need,"},"811":{"dur":1,"text":"and won't go into detail because\nyou already know about that,"},"813":{"dur":4,"text":"is a big rocket, and this is the\nSLS and it begins with the 70"},"818":{"dur":4,"text":"metric ton capability and will\ngrow to a 130 metric ton launch"},"822":{"dur":1,"text":"capability."},"824":{"dur":4,"text":"So, let's talk little bit about\nhow the launch affects entry,"},"828":{"dur":2,"text":"descent, and landing."},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"So, with your big rocket you\nhave to package your payload up"},"832":{"dur":5,"text":"on the top of this\nrocket inside of a ferring."},"838":{"dur":3,"text":"Now that ferring size is limited\nby what the rocket can launch"},"841":{"dur":2,"text":"and the aerodynamic loads\nthat are going to be on and it's"},"844":{"dur":3,"text":"purpose is to protect your\npayload whatever we are wanting"},"847":{"dur":3,"text":"to send to Mars from the\natmosphere of Earth as we are"},"850":{"dur":2,"text":"trying to push\nthrough it really quickly."},"853":{"dur":4,"text":"But the size of that ferring\nlimits the size or the diameter"},"857":{"dur":2,"text":"of the vehicle that\nwe can send to Mars."},"859":{"dur":1,"text":"And so what is that\nimportant to entry,"},"861":{"dur":1,"text":"descent, landing?"},"863":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, the larger diameter\nvehicle that we can get to Mars,"},"867":{"dur":2,"text":"the more drag we can create\nas we are trying to enter that"},"870":{"dur":3,"text":"atmosphere and slow down and\ntherefore more mass we can get"},"873":{"dur":1,"text":"to the surface of Mars."},"874":{"dur":2,"text":"But right now with our\ncurrent limitations,"},"876":{"dur":2,"text":"as I mentioned before, we are\nlimited to about 1 metric ton to"},"879":{"dur":1,"text":"the surface of Mars."},"881":{"dur":3,"text":"So, with that ferring up there\nwe have our vehicle packaged in"},"884":{"dur":2,"text":"it, we launch, we accelerate,\nafter we get out of Earth's"},"886":{"dur":2,"text":"atmosphere, we have\ndropped the ferring,"},"889":{"dur":1,"text":"we now get up into orbit."},"891":{"dur":2,"text":"We check our

an"},"1082":{"dur":2,"text":"awful lot of force\nfrom the vehicle,"},"1084":{"dur":3,"text":"there is an awful lot of\nheating on the vehicle and the"},"1087":{"dur":1,"text":"atmosphere itself\nhas

one."},"1217":{"dur":3,"text":"But one of the things we didn't\nknow before sending the Mars"},"1220":{"dur":3,"text":"exploration rovers is how\nprevalent or how common

only"},"1230":{"dur":4,"text":"designed for a 90-day life\nbecause one of the main reasons"},"1234":{"dur":2,"text":"is we thought that dust would\ncollect on the solar cells

off"},"1250":{"dur":2,"text":"the solar cells, pops back up."},"1252":{"dur":4,"text":"So we have had these exploration\nrovers up there for many,"},"1256":{"dur":2,"text":"many years, like they

the point is we do\nknow a lot more"},"1328":{"dur":1,"text":"now than we used to."},"1329":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you look here in the\nViking area at the same scale,"},"1332":{"dur":2,"text":"we

right?"},"1570":{"dur":4,"text":"But for current state of the\nart it is experiencing 10 Gs and"},"1574":{"dur":3,"text":"then we start maneuvering,\nessentially doing S turns in the"},"1578":{"dur":3,"text":"atmosphere to help us slow down\nand as we get down closer to"},"1581":{"dur":3,"text":"Mach 2 we can deploy the\nsupersonic parachute which helps"},"1584":{"dur":4,"text":"us slow down a lot more.\nWe drop the heat shield."},"1588":{"dur":3,"text":"The radar system then is looking\nfor the surface to find out"},"1591":{"dur":2,"text":"exactly how high we are\nand how fast we are moving,"},"1594":{"dur":2,"text":"and once it finds that\nit drops the payload,"},"1597":{"dur":5,"text":"in this case for

show you a little bit\nmore of that in a few minutes."},"1616":{"dur":5,"text":"But while flying through the\nEDL sequence the vehicle system"},"1622":{"dur":3,"text":"needs to be able to land\nwithin

the landing area\nfor that Mars Science Laboratory"},"1632":{"dur":3,"text":"Mission, and we\ntargeted Gale Crater,"},"1635":{"dur":4,"text":"but that was impossible just a\nfew years ago because like when"},"1639":{"dur":3,"text":"we did the Path Finder Mission\nit is landing uncertainty was"},"1643":{"dur":2,"text":"larger than the\ncrater itself, right?"},"1646":{"dur":2,"text":"But we have gotten a\nlot better since then,"},"1648":{"dur":3,"text":"so here is the landing ellipse\nor the landing uncertainty is"},"1652":{"dur":2,"text":"what we call it, for the Mars\nScience Laboratory Mission."},"1654":{"dur":3,"text":"So, after all the calculations\nwe do and understanding how this"},"1658":{"dur":3,"text":"EDL system will perform we\nare very confident it will land"},"1662":{"dur":1,"text":"somewhere in that ellipse."},"1663":{"dur":3,"text":"The target of\ncourse is the center,"},"1666":{"dur":2,"text":"and in this case for MSL we\nactually did pretty well,"},"1669":{"dur":2,"text":"we were only about 2 kilometers\naway from the very center of"},"1671":{"dur":4,"text":"that ellipse, but the point is\nfor humans we need to be able to"},"1676":{"dur":3,"text":"land in an area that is 10\ntimes smaller than that even."},"1679":{"dur":5,"text":"So, within about 0.1 kilometers\nof our targeted landing area."},"1685":{"dur":2,"text":"So, let's take a quick look\nat how sort of the history of"},"1688":{"dur":4,"text":"entry, descent, landing at Mars.\nI mentioned the Viking Mission."},"1692":{"dur":2,"text":"So, Viking sent\ntwo probes to Mars,"},"1695":{"dur":3,"text":"they were landers, they entered\nwith a rigid 70-degree sphere"},"1698":{"dur":3,"text":"cone

'70s."},"1716":{"dur":3,"text":"Those activities made it\npossible for us to understand"},"1719":{"dur":2,"text":"the 70-degree sphere cone\naeroshell and how"},"1721":{"dur":1,"text":"that was going

the"},"1729":{"dur":1,"text":"autonomous propulsive landing."},"1731":{"dur":2,"text":"So, if we look at some of\nthe more recent missions,"},"1733":{"dur":3,"text":"Mars Path Finder, it\nlanded a

was\nthat its computer was listening"},"1756":{"dur":3,"text":"to its touchdown\nsensor too early,"},"1759":{"dur":3,"text":"so this touchdown sensor is\nlooking for a shock when it"},"1762":{"dur":3,"text":"touches on the surface to\nturn off its landing engines."},"1765":{"dur":2,"text":"And so what most likely happened\nis it was listening to it too"},"1767":{"dur":4,"text":"early and then it deployed its\nlanding legs and shocked the"},"1772":{"dur":2,"text":"system and the sensor\nthought it touched down,"},"1774":{"dur":2,"text":"it turned off the engine and\nmost likely fell the last 60"},"1777":{"dur":1,"text":"meters to the surface."},"1779":{"dur":3,"text":"So, we then did the\nMars Exploration Rovers,"},"1782":{"dur":4,"text":"so let's take a look at\ntheir EDL architecture."},"1786":{"dur":4,"text":"So again we have 70-degree\nsphere cone aeroshell separate"},"1791":{"dur":3,"text":"from the crew stage and we\nare coming straight in to"},"1794":{"dur":3,"text":"ballistically into\nthe Mars atmosphere."},"1798":{"dur":2,"text":"So that heat shield protecting\nus from the air heating,"},"1800":{"dur":3,"text":"we are

these\ntechnologies together for humans"},"2649":{"dur":3,"text":"to actually get to and\nexplore the surface of Mars?"},"2652":{"dur":1,"text":"So, NASA has done\nlot of studies."},"2654":{"dur":2,"text":"This I am not expecting to go\nthrough in detail but this is"},"2657":{"dur":1,"text":"looking at different\ncombinations of these"},"2659":{"dur":2,"text":"technologies and we are running\nsimulations to understand how"},"2661":{"dur":3,"text":"those might work and which\nones are more

is\na better way to go."},"2703":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's the thing."},"2704":{"dur":3,"text":"If we were to pick today how we\nare going to get humans to the"},"2708":{"dur":2,"text":"surface of

there is a lot\nof work to get there,"},"2741":{"dur":3,"text":"but there is nothing that\nsay that it can't be done."},"2744":{"dur":1,"text":"So, let's talk about\nsome of those

of the"},"2761":{"dur":1,"text":"atmosphere into orbit."},"2763":{"dur":2,"text":"So you didn't have to\ncarry a bunch of"},"2766":{"dur":1,"text":"rocket fuel to slow\nyourself down."},"2768":{"dur":3,"text":"You use the atmosphere, and this\nallows you to use a smaller more"},"2771":{"dur":3,"text":"affordable launch vehicles to\nget the system there and also"},"2775":{"dur":3,"text":"allows you to have a\nhigher payload fraction,"},"2778":{"dur":2,"text":"meaning, since you don't\nhave all that propulsion or the"},"2781":{"dur":1,"text":"propulsive capability\nthat you brought with you,"},"2783":{"dur":2,"text":"you can have more\npayload, and the example here,"},"2786":{"dur":3,"text":"if you are really using\naerocapture you can have 80% of"},"2789":{"dur":2,"text":"your vehicle system to your\npayload as opposed to if you are"},"2792":{"dur":2,"text":"doing propulsive\nit is about 20%."},"2794":{"dur":2,"text":"So it makes a big difference\nin the architecture studies."},"2797":{"dur":2,"text":"So, we need to slow\ndown more mass at"},"2800":{"dur":1,"text":"higher altitudes we\nhave talked about."},"2802":{"dur":1,"text":"So the limit of\nthat ferring size,"},"2804":{"dur":4,"text":"the size of the aeroshell that\nwe can bring to Mars and help us"},"2808":{"dur":1,"text":"slowdown is a big limit."},"2809":{"dur":2,"text":"Just have a small\nimage here on that,"},"2812":{"dur":2,"text":"but this is supposed to\nrepresent the rocket ferring and"},"2815":{"dur":4,"text":"then that was the

with"},"2827":{"dur":2,"text":"us, I mean we can store it and\nlaunch it and everything and"},"2829":{"dur":3,"text":"then we are able to deploy it or\ninflate it as we get to Mars and"},"2833":{"dur":2,"text":"it is a much larger drag area."},"2837":{"dur":3,"text":"So, the anatomy of this, you\nhave an inflatable structure,"},"2840":{"dur":1,"text":"those are two main things,
