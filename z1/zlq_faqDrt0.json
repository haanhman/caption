familiar, it makes the unfamiliar\nmore familiar, more understandable."},"637":{"dur":5,"text":"So when you're dealing with ethereal truths,\ncome up with a practical story, and the

story with\na heavenly meaning."},"651":{"dur":6,"text":"But it's just better to see it as a human\nexample or story that brings you in."},"658":{"dur":7,"text":"It usually has just one major point, but it\nhighlights, it illustrates something of heavenly"},"665":{"dur":3,"text":"value, some great truth."},"669":{"dur":5,"text":"And so Jesus placed alongside of what he was\nteaching these familiar stories."},"674":{"dur":8,"text":"By the way, it was one of most rabbis' favorite\nways to teach their disciples."},"683":{"dur":4,"text":"So here's the parable: \" 'A sower went out\nto sow

Christ?"},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm not asking you to answer that all at one\ntime out loud."},"838":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a rhetorical, sort of inward question."},"841":{"dur":1,"text":"But think of

is the soil---the\nseed, the sower, and the soil---the soil turns"},"946":{"dur":3,"text":"out to be the heart."},"949":{"dur":4,"text":"And there's four different conditions of the\nheart that Jesus describes."},"953":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, this is interesting to me: he gives the\nparable, and \"When he had said these things,\""},"959":{"dur":5,"text":"verse 8, \"he cried, 'He who has ears to

parable mean?'"},"987":{"dur":6,"text":"\" So, he told a beautiful little story, very\nshort story, and they went \"Huh?\""},"993":{"dur":7,"text":"So they obviously didn't seem to have great\nears to hear it, said, \"What does it mean?\""},"1000":{"dur":6,"text":"And he says in verse 10, \" 'To you, to you\nit has been given to know the mysteries of"},"1007":{"dur":7,"text":"the kingdom of God,
