think about her, her generosity,"},"82":{"dur":4,"text":"her toughness and many like her in that generation."},"87":{"dur":3,"text":"But let's talk about resilience today."},"90":{"dur":2,"text":"This is a picture of the Hotel Montana"},"93":{"dur":2,"text":"taken in Port-au-Prince, Haiti"},"95":{"dur":4,"text":"just after the devastating earthquake in 2010."},"100":{"dur":2,"text":"As you can see,

than tripled."},"122":{"dur":3,"text":"The number of natural disasters has actually doubled."},"126":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's look at the numbers."},"129":{"dur":1,"text":"Over the past 30 years,"},"130":{"dur":3,"text":"in low-income and middle-income countries alone"},"134":{"dur":5,"text":"we have lost 1.2 trillion dollars due to damage."},"139":{"dur":5,"text":"That is equivalent to the GDP annually of Mexico."},"144":{"dur":2,"text":"Another way to think of it is that it is equivalent"},"147":{"dur":2,"text":"to a third of all the official development assistance"},"150":{"dur":2,"text":"that we've given in the same time period."},"152":{"dur":2,"text":"So think, that for every three dollars of"},"155":{"dur":3,"text":"overseas development aid that we've given,"},"159":{"dur":3,"text":"we've taken one and thrown it away."},"162":{"dur":2,"text":"In the same period, the same 30 years,"},"165":{"dur":3,"text":"2.3 million people have perished."},"168":{"dur":3,"text":"That's the population of Namibia."},"171":{"dur":4,"text":"This is something that we need to pay attention to."},"176":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's getting more difficult."},"179":{"dur":3,"text":"Climate change is ravaging\nespecially poor countries."},"182":{"dur":2,"text":"Already this is not a phenomena for the future,"},"185":{"dur":2,"text":"it's for us today."},"187":{"dur":4,"text":"Already countries are trying to work\ntheir way through the complex nexus"},"191":{"dur":4,"text":"between a food crisis, a water crisis\nand an energy crisis"},"196":{"dur":2,"text":"and climate change is just making it more difficult"},"199":{"dur":2,"text":"and raising uncertainty."},"202":{"dur":2,"text":"At the same time, over the next 40 years"},"204":{"dur":4,"text":"we will add 2.6 billion people to the cities of the world"},"209":{"dur":2,"text":"most of that in developing countries."},"212":{"dur":4,"text":"In fact, 90% of that growth\nwill be in South Asia and Africa."},"217":{"dur":4,"text":"And, between now and 2050,\nwe will double the number of"},"221":{"dur":4,"text":"people exposed to cyclones, and mudslides"},"225":{"dur":2,"text":"and collapse as a result of natural disasters"},"228":{"dur":5,"text":"in urban settings to more than 1.5 billion people."},"233":{"dur":2,"text":"The lack of building codes, the lack of"},"236":{"dur":5,"text":"enforced building codes,\nwill punish these people."},"241":{"dur":2,"text":"And it will be the poor,\nfor it is always the poor,"},"244":{"dur":3,"text":"the most vulnerable that will suffer most."},"248":{"dur":3,"text":"So think of the story that we are\nbeginning to understand."},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"We have more and more disasters."},"254":{"dur":3,"text":"Their intensity is being developed by climate change."},"257":{"dur":2,"text":"Climate change is adding to uncertainty"},"259":{"dur":2,"text":"and we have a path of urbanization"},"262":{"dur":3,"text":"that this civilization has never seen before."},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"How do we invest in our resilience?"},"268":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, there are two key ways."},"271":{"dur":3,"text":"First of all, we actually have to change our growth path."},"275":{"dur":4,"text":"We need to move to a greener\nand more inclusive growth now."},"279":{"dur":2,"text":"Every country can start on that journey"},"281":{"dur":3,"text":"we must mitigate and adapt to climate change."},"285":{"dur":5,"text":"At the same time, we need to invest\nin disaster risk management."},"290":{"dur":3,"text":"Disaster risk management must be part of development."},"294":{"dur":3,"text":"But it must also be considered a first line of defence"},"298":{"dur":4,"text":"against the uncertainty that is coming tomorrow."},"302":{"dur":1,"text":"We need action in the public sector"},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"we need frameworks in public policy"},"306":{"dur":3,"text":"we need awareness and investment in the private sector"},"309":{"dur":4,"text":"and we need civil society\nand communities to engage."},"314":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, I talked to you earlier on\nabout the hotel in Haiti"},"317":{"dur":3,"text":"the Hotel Montana, that had pancaked,\nthat had collapsed --"},"320":{"dur":3,"text":"this is where we are today,\nthis is the Westin in Sendai"},"323":{"dur":4,"text":"a gorgeous 37 storey hotel that survived"},"327":{"dur":4,"text":"the catastrophic earthquake on March 11th, 2011,"},"332":{"dur":1,"text":"the great Japan earthquake,"},"333":{"dur":1,"text":"with almost no damage at all."},"335":{"dur":4,"text":"In fact it served as a disaster response centre."},"340":{"dur":3,"text":"Disaster risk management is\nin the building code in Japan"},"343":{"dur":5,"text":"disaster risk management in the building code\nis enforced in Japan."},"348":{"dur":4,"text":"Disaster risk management is part\nof the curricula in schools in Japan"},"352":{"dur":3,"text":"and disaster risk management, not disaster"},"356":{"dur":5,"text":"is part of the public discourse, here in Japan."},"362":{"dur":4,"text":"So, every country, every government,\ncan take steps now,"},"366":{"dur":3,"text":"no matter where they are\non the development trajectory,"},"369":{"dur":4,"text":"to try to start to invest in their own resilience."},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"But there is much more that can be done by"},"376":{"dur":1,"text":"the international community as well."},"378":{"dur":5,"text":"Often, we offer too little, too late."},"383":{"dur":4,"text":"Between 1980 and 2009, the international community"},"388":{"dur":6,"text":"spent 90 billion US dollars\non disaster-related assistance."},"394":{"dur":4,"text":"But of that 90 billion, only 3.6%"},"399":{"dur":3,"text":"was invested in prevention and preparedness."},"403":{"dur":3,"text":"The other 96% plus was invested in emergency"},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"response and reconstruction."},"409":{"dur":3,"text":"We have to change those numbers."},"412":{"dur":3,"text":"We have to switch that graph around."},"415":{"dur":4,"text":"In fact, we have to move\nfrom a tradition of response"},"419":{"dur":4,"text":"to a culture of prevention,\na culture of resilience."},"424":{"dur":3,"text":"But let me give you an example\nof what does seem to start working."},"428":{"dur":3,"text":"This is the island of Saint Lucia, in the Caribbean"},"432":{"dur":3,"text":"a small island developing state buffeted by storms"},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"and hurricanes where landslides are,"},"437":{"dur":4,"text":"unfortunately far too often,\npart of the rhythm of life there."},"442":{"dur":5,"text":"In 2008, the World Bank, working\nwith 5 communities on the island"},"447":{"dur":4,"text":"started to try to invest in the resilience\nof these communities"},"451":{"dur":3,"text":"and their ability to withstand and to avoid landslides."},"455":{"dur":3,"text":"And we built these hillside drains."},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"In 2010, when Hurricane Tomas hit the island"},"463":{"dur":3,"text":"unfortunately many communities\nsuffered the landslides"},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"that are so often part of the rhythm of life there"},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"but the five communities where these hillside drains"},"472":{"dur":3,"text":"had been built suffered no losses at all."},"476":{"dur":4,"text":"It's important to understand\nthe economics of this project as well."},"481":{"dur":4,"text":"For every dollar that the community\ninvested in these drains"},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"it saved another three dollars\nthat it would have had"},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"to spend on response and on reconstruction"},"492":{"dur":5,"text":"if they had not taken the steps\ntowards preparedness."},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"So, if disaster risk resilience seems to make"},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"such economic and business sense"},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"is the private sector interested?"},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"Is the private sector investing?"},"507":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, the good news is that leaders are."},"510":{"dur":4,"text":"This is a picture of the Port of Cartagena, in Colombia"},"515":{"dur":4,"text":"which is operated by a private firm, Muelles de Bosque"},"519":{"dur":3,"text":"on a long term government concession."},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"Recently they undertook a study together with"},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"the International Finance Corporation the private sector"},"527":{"dur":3,"text":"lending arm of the World Bank where they looked at"},"531":{"dur":4,"text":"the risks to the port operating environment from"},"535":{"dur":3,"text":"changes in climate and changes in weather pattern."},"539":{"dur":1,"text":"What was interesting was that"},"541":{"dur":1,"text":"in order to get the data for the report"},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"they had to go to 30 different\npublic and private sources"},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"which shows that there is\nmuch to be done to make"},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"the data and awareness of these issues"},"550":{"dur":3,"text":"more available to public and private sector alike."},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"But the report resulted in recommendations"},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"from changing the dredging regime"},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"for the way that ships approach the port"},"561":{"dur":4,"text":"to drainage to onside land operations."},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"So, for example, changing the heights of roads"},"568":{"dur":1,"text":"and things like this."},"570":{"dur":1,"text":"And as a result of those recommendations"},"572":{"dur":3,"text":"Muelles de Bosque invested 30 million dollars"},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"in new capital construction"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"in order to make them more resilient"},"580":{"dur":4,"text":"in order to improve their operations going forward."},"585":{"dur":3,"text":"So this port company was able to see the benefit"},"589":{"dur":3,"text":"from investing in their ability to be resilient going forward"},"593":{"dur":3,"text":"and that this was a commercial advantage to them."},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"So I've talked about the public sector"},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"and I've talked about the private sector"},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"and now we need to talk about community."},"606":{"dur":3,"text":"We know empirically that communities that have"},"609":{"dur":5,"text":"stronger social bonds do better in disaster."},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"We know that in fact those strong social bonds"},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"are one of the strongest determinants"},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"of resilience within the community."},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, it makes intuitive sense"},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"neighbours know which neighbour needs help"},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"which neighbour is vulnerable"},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"which neighbour is weakest."},"631":{"dur":3,"text":"We also know that families,\nneighbours and friends"},"634":{"dur":6,"text":"are the ones that help reconstruct\nfirst after disaster has hit."},"640":{"dur":1,"text":"And so when we think of resilience"},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"this is not an adapt construct"},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"it's not just a word"},"647":{"dur":1,"text":"that is thrown around in development circles."},"649":{"dur":5,"text":"Resilience is, both, the need for public policy"},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"and the need for private investment."},"656":{"dur":3,"text":"It's also about a different response\nfrom the international community"},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"and it is about the local municipal leaders"},"663":{"dur":1,"text":"the mayors that we elect"},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"to lead us through these uncertain times."},"668":{"dur":4,"text":"But resilience, very importantly, is about community."},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"I think the people of Japan know that."},"675":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that my grandmother"},"676":{"dur":1,"text":"her friends and others in our community"},"678":{"dur":3,"text":"when I was growing up knew that too."},"681":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, for me personally,\nwhen I think of resilience"},"684":{"dur":3,"text":"I think of top-down policy\nand investment flows"},"688":{"dur":3,"text":"but I think of bottom-up building of community."},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"For me, resilience is about you and me"},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"and the bonds that bring us together."},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you."},"698":{"dur":4,"text":"(Applause)"}}
