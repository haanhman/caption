If we don't"},"48":{"dur":4,"text":"keep them going, they're not gonna be there for much longer. Exactly right, so we've got"},"53":{"dur":3,"text":"this lovely bit of pork belly, and we're gonna really blast this on the barbecue to get that"},"57":{"dur":4,"text":"crackling going, then reduce the temperature right down, do it low and slow, a proper barbecue."},"61":{"dur":5,"text":"At the same time, we're gonna be making this really delicious, it's a cider gravy. We've"},"67":{"dur":4,"text":"got all these, got celery, carrots, onions\nand this lovely British cider here and we're"},"71":{"dur":3,"text":"gonna make this lovely cider gravy to go with that. Do we get to drink some of that? I've"},"74":{"dur":3,"text":"got a couple of spare ones here. Right lovely. We are gonna have about 4 hours where we don't"},"77":{"dur":4,"text":"have to do anything at all. We need to be\nsteady. Yeah, so we'll have just one. Yeah."},"82":{"dur":3,"text":"So that is what we're gonna be doing and it\nis going to be delicious. Okay so what're"},"86":{"dur":4,"text":"we gonna cook on? We're gonna cook on this Weber One Touch 57cm Premium. Fantastic product,"},"91":{"dur":4,"text":"I love this product, I cook on it all the\ntime. I love gas as well, but I love this"},"95":{"dur":7,"text":"product even more, it's brilliant. Nice charcoal. Fire lighters. Nice and easy to light. Yeah,"},"106":{"dur":3,"text":"as always it's about quality isn't it? You\nget like a really cheap fire-lighter, it doesn't"},"110":{"dur":3,"text":"work as well. Every single time this is going\nto work isn't it? Yeah. Nice little lighter"},"113":{"dur":6,"text":"from Weber. Nice and easy. Straight away.\nYeah, and they do light very quickly. There"},"119":{"dur":6,"text":"you go, job done. And when you have the Weber Chimney Starter full with the briquettes,"},"126":{"dur":4,"text":"these briquettes are brilliant. Last 4 to\n6 hours, at a really maximum heat. You can"},"130":{"dur":3,"text":"go out and buy cheap ones out there. Just\nnot worth it. Yeah, don't bother. It's well"},"134":{"dur":3,"text":"worth its money. We'll just leave that now\nfor about 20 minutes and that'll be fine."},"138":{"dur":5,"text":"Now do you want to cook on direct heat or\nin-direct heat? For this pork, I'm gonna do"},"143":{"dur":6,"text":"in-direct for this one. These chimney starters are absolutely brilliant aren't they? Oh yeah."},"150":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're gonna have a charcoal barbecue,\nyou've got to have a Chimney Starter. It makes"},"153":{"dur":5,"text":"life so much easier. You then, when you're\ncontrolling which way you want to cook, whether"},"158":{"dur":4,"text":"it's direct heat or in-direct heat, you simply\npick it up, with a pair of gloves and place"},"162":{"dur":4,"text":"it either side, or in the middle. Superb and\nI've noticed a couple of things there I just"},"166":{"dur":3,"text":"wanna try and talk about. First thing I've\nnoticed is you've got this right down on the"},"169":{"dur":3,"text":"charcoal grate. Yeah. Is that kind of a little\nsafety tip. No, I like it from the safety"},"173":{"dur":3,"text":"point of view, some people like to put it\non the top, but I like it on the safety point"},"176":{"dur":4,"text":"of view that, it's down there, it's out of\nthe way and it gets a good draft coming up"},"181":{"dur":3,"text":"as well. So you can almost see the flames,\nthat's been going for about two minutes, you"},"185":{"dur":6,"text":"can almost see the flames coming up here already. It's really driving that heat, right up through"},"191":{"dur":3,"text":"the middle, very quickly. The other thing\nI've noticed is you've got the coals, in this"},"195":{"dur":2,"text":"case, right up to the top. That's cause we\nwanna get a really high temperature. We've"},"198":{"dur":6,"text":"got to be at 500 for that, for the crackling.\nReally nice heat and then drop it back down,"},"204":{"dur":3,"text":"where we can shut the vents down a little\nbit and reduce that heat down. Because it's"},"207":{"dur":4,"text":"gonna be a long slow cook isn't it? Exactly,\nso that's kind of grilling temperature to"},"212":{"dur":2,"text":"start with. But if you wanted to do a kind\nof roasting temperature 180-200 where would"},"214":{"dur":5,"text":"you be on that. About 3 quarters but don't\nforget, the tip is with this. Is that with"},"220":{"dur":5,"text":"these briquettes, they are so intense in heat, so if you're doing just a couple of burgers"},"225":{"dur":4,"text":"or something. Just put a quarter of a chimney\nstarter in there and it's gonna work and you"},"230":{"dur":4,"text":"don't waste any of the charcoal, it's brilliant.\nOr briquettes in this case. Yeah, exactly."},"234":{"dur":3,"text":"If you've got one of the smaller barbecues\nof course, they make a little mini version"},"238":{"dur":2,"text":"of the chimney starters as well don't they?\nYeah and that's just for the small ones. So"},"241":{"dur":3,"text":"like, your Weber Go Anywhere any of those type of barbecues. Or Weber Smokey Joe? Yeah,"},"244":{"dur":3,"text":"Smokey Joe, perfect for that. So just seriously, if you're gonna do a barbecue you should not"},"248":{"dur":3,"text":"be without one of those. Yeah, and look at\nthat. That's already about 10 years old, it's"},"251":{"dur":3,"text":"been thrown around, we leave it out it the\nwinter, look at it. Still nearly as good as"},"255":{"dur":3,"text":"the day it was bought and that's gonna last\nanother ten years I reckon. Just brilliant."},"258":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, so we can literally walk away from that now. Oh yeah, leave it, let it get on with"},"261":{"dur":3,"text":"it. Let\u2019s have a little look at what we've\ngot here then. Whilst that's doing its thing,"},"265":{"dur":4,"text":"all we need to do is get on with this. So\na couple of things I've gotta show you here."},"269":{"dur":3,"text":"I've already got some celery, carrots and\nonions in there, I'm just gonna put a few"},"272":{"dur":4,"text":"more in. As always. I'm gonna do a lot of\ncooking, a lot of barbecuing, If you're gonna"},"277":{"dur":4,"text":"do anything, get yourself a decent knife.\nSo again this is a flint and flame knife,"},"281":{"dur":4,"text":"this one is called a 7 and a half inch santoku. It's a bit like a chef\u2019s knife but it's"},"285":{"dur":5,"text":"got a bit more of a rock on it. Yeah. It's\na absolutely beautiful knife and super sharp."},"291":{"dur":6,"text":"So I've got a couple of carrots and bits of\ncelery here. So all you need to do here, literally"},"297":{"dur":7,"text":"there is no finesse involved in this. Just\ngive it a bit of a rough chop, chuck it in."},"305":{"dur":5,"text":"There's nothing difficult about this at all,\nget a couple of carrots in there. Again always"},"310":{"dur":5,"text":"keep your fingers tucked away underneath,\ndon't rush this part. You wouldn't wanna cut"},"315":{"dur":4,"text":"your fingers with that knife would you? It's\ntoo sharp. There's this thing, it's a genuine"},"319":{"dur":6,"text":"truth. A sharp knife is a safe knife. In the\nunlikely event that you're gonna cut yourself,"},"326":{"dur":5,"text":"what's better is to have a clean cut, cause\na clean cut will feel a bit better. But if"},"331":{"dur":3,"text":"you just do something sensible likes this,\nthis is a nice little tip for you if you're"},"335":{"dur":5,"text":"cutting anything. When you've got your fingers, little claw, bring them in like that and then"},"341":{"dur":4,"text":"that way you'll see that this part of the\nknife is on the back part of your fingers"},"345":{"dur":6,"text":"and that way you're not gonna cut anything\nand just pay attention. Okay, it's very, very"},"351":{"dur":5,"text":"simple okay. So we'll put those in there.\nI've got a mix of red onions and white onions."},"356":{"dur":4,"text":"Yeah lovely, that's some really good flavour. One thing we'll do as well, I always like"},"361":{"dur":4,"text":"to do a little knife sharpening exercise.\nMost people have knifes at home and even a"},"365":{"dur":4,"text":"good knife needs sharpening. Yeah. Okay, particularly after you haven't sharpened it for quite some"},"370":{"dur":4,"text":"time. So this little bit of kit here, this\nis a ceramic sharpener. And there's a little"},"374":{"dur":5,"text":"ceramic wheel in there, little bit of water\nand the wheel moves backwards and forwards"},"380":{"dur":5,"text":"along the knife. And its set at 18 degrees,\nwhich is the optimum sharpening angle. And"},"385":{"dur":6,"text":"I'm gonna show you how hard it is to sharpen a knife, okay? So here we go. Put your fingers"},"392":{"dur":4,"text":"on, now not putting any particular downward pressure on this. I'm just kinda letting the"},"397":{"dur":4,"text":"weight of the knife do the work. Look how\nsimple that is. That's it. Is that it? Yeah,"},"401":{"dur":3,"text":"you're done. And what you should be doing. Don't be surprised if that's missing by the"},"405":{"dur":4,"text":"end of this demonstration. This is such a\nfantastic bit of kit. They're just brilliant."},"409":{"dur":4,"text":"So that's that, we've got our knife sharpened. And what we're gonna do now is we're gonna"},"414":{"dur":5,"text":"move onto the pork, okay. So again, nice sharp knife. Got this lovely bit of pork, we said"},"419":{"dur":3,"text":"earlier it was Iver and John at G Picket Family Butchers and I just love the fact. They're"},"423":{"dur":4,"text":"great butchers they really are. Just round\nthe corner. Yeah. Perfect. Yeah. Now you don't"},"427":{"dur":4,"text":"wanna spur the horses on this. There's a big bit of skin there and you're gonna really"},"432":{"dur":7,"text":"need to get all the way through it or almost\nall the way through. But also the great thing"},"440":{"dur":3,"text":"with this Andrew is that this is a cheap joint\nisn't it? Yeah. It's not expensive for the"},"444":{"dur":4,"text":"size of it. Yeah, exactly. Now this, this\nis only kind of 3 and a half, 4 kilogram piece."},"449":{"dur":5,"text":"But can you imagine how many people you could feed with this. Yeah. And this is the other"},"455":{"dur":4,"text":"thing. I love a burger, I absolutely love\na really good burger made with chuck steak,"},"460":{"dur":4,"text":"that kinda thing. But do you know what? If\nyou've got a beautiful barbecue like this."},"464":{"dur":5,"text":"Get something big in it. Do some proper barbecuing. Yeah. It's really, really simple. We're doing"},"470":{"dur":5,"text":"a little bit of prep now. You can see I'm\nmaking sure that I'm really getting that skin"},"475":{"dur":3,"text":"and back all the way. This is the bit you\nwanna take a little bit of time with. Again"},"479":{"dur":4,"text":"you notice that my fingers, I've still got\nthem in like this, the knife is coming this"},"483":{"dur":4,"text":"way, my fingers are not in the way. That is\ngonna make super crackling isn't it? Exactly"},"488":{"dur":5,"text":"yeah and what I might do this time. Normally I do just score this way, but I think what"},"494":{"dur":5,"text":"we'll do is we'll score it the other way as\nwell and get some nice little square bits"},"499":{"dur":6,"text":"going. Now this will take a little bit of\ntime, so we'll just keep doing this. One of"},"505":{"dur":5,"text":"the things that I think is beautiful about\nbarbecuing, you can go anywhere with it can\u2019t"},"511":{"dur":4,"text":"you? Oh yeah. I mean, I'm gonna do a fairly simple rub today on this one. I'm gonna use"},"515":{"dur":4,"text":"one of Weber's amazing; I've got 3 different\nrubs here. I'm gonna use one them. It's a"},"519":{"dur":5,"text":"kinda herb rub they do, lovely bit of oregano, bit of garlic, salt, pepper, there's a little"},"524":{"dur":4,"text":"touch of Demerara sugar in there as well.\nYeah, just gives you a bit of sweetness. So"},"529":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm just gonna go with that, if you're kind\nof new to barbecuing just use something like"},"533":{"dur":4,"text":"that. Lower on down the line as you get more kind of proficient, we've got people making"},"538":{"dur":5,"text":"lovely Asian spiced rubs, they're doing beautiful Indian rubs. All sorts of different things,"},"543":{"dur":4,"text":"you know. Persian spices you can get in there, you can do all sorts of different things."},"547":{"dur":6,"text":"So, the sky is the limit really, but we're\ngonna start fairly, simply here. And it's"},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"worth spending the time doing this, to get\nthis crackling right. Absolutely, I mean the"},"557":{"dur":4,"text":"crackling is gonna be perfect. I mean for\nme this is part of the fun of it. Yeah. This"},"562":{"dur":6,"text":"is the idea and we'll have a really good time doing this. That's looking really good isn't"},"568":{"dur":4,"text":"it? Exactly, you know what? It's worth spending a few minutes doing this. And just really"},"573":{"dur":4,"text":"have a bit of fun with it; I love this part\nof it. It's really lovely. Okay, so last little"},"577":{"dur":5,"text":"one there. Just make sure you get that skin\nreally, really nicely. Nice little groove"},"583":{"dur":4,"text":"in there. There we go. That's what we want. That knife really cuts into it, doesn't it?"},"587":{"dur":4,"text":"It does. I mean, the skin is pretty tough\nyou know. Oh yeah, so you do need a nice,"},"591":{"dur":4,"text":"good, sharp knife for that. Now what we're\ngonna do next. Now this, as you can see, we've"},"596":{"dur":6,"text":"still got the bone in. To be honest, bone\nin, bone out, it's up to you. I don't wanna"},"602":{"dur":4,"text":"mess about then particularly so I'm gonna\nget the bone in. And later on you'll see when"},"606":{"dur":4,"text":"we've cooked this, it'll just fall off. So\nthe next thing I've got some lovely rope seed"},"611":{"dur":7,"text":"oil here. I'm a huge fan of rope seed oil,\nfor several different reasons. The first one"},"619":{"dur":5,"text":"is that it is a whole British product. You\nsee the fields everywhere, it's a fantastic"},"625":{"dur":4,"text":"product, really, really great product and\nwe should all be using it to support all the"},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"British farmers. And look, I mean look at\nthe colour on it. It's a beautiful colour;"},"632":{"dur":4,"text":"I've never used it before I've always used\nolive oil. Right, so I love olive oil, don't"},"636":{"dur":3,"text":"get me wrong. But here's another reason why you should use rope seed oil when your barbecuing."},"640":{"dur":5,"text":"Rope seed oil has a massively high smoke point. Oh right. So it is very, very difficult to"},"646":{"dur":4,"text":"burn it, where as olive oil. You can actually\nburn it quite easily. Yeah, I have noticed"},"650":{"dur":3,"text":"that. And then you get that slightly bitter\ntaste. Yeah. But you won\u2019t get that with"},"654":{"dur":4,"text":"this. So that's another great reason to use\nit and of course another reason, it's about"},"658":{"dur":5,"text":"half the cholesterol of olive oil and that's\na health point.Something I have to worry about."},"663":{"dur":3,"text":"Well I wasn't going to say anything Russell\nbut there you go. So look, we've got some"},"666":{"dur":5,"text":"rope seed oil on that okay. We talked before about, you can go as far as you want with"},"672":{"dur":3,"text":"this. When you're a bit more proficient you\ncan start using all sorts of spice, rubs,"},"675":{"dur":4,"text":"you can make your own, it's great fun to do\nit. But if you're just starting out. There"},"679":{"dur":4,"text":"are plenty of great rubs out there. So we've\ngot 3 here, this is a pepper blend, that Weber"},"684":{"dur":4,"text":"make, black, white, green and red bell peppers that's one of them. This one, American BBQ"},"689":{"dur":4,"text":"sea salt, tomato, garlic and a load of other\nspices as well. But today what we're gonna"},"693":{"dur":5,"text":"use is this one, this is the herb salt. So\nsea salt, rosemary, garlic and oregano or"},"698":{"dur":4,"text":"oregano, if you're from America. But the salt is really gonna bring out flavour in that"},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"isn't it? Yeah, you want a nice bit of salt,\nI may even put a touch more on that skin."},"707":{"dur":4,"text":"I was gonna say I always put plenty of salt\non the skin. Again, just get this. So we've"},"711":{"dur":4,"text":"got the rope seed oil on and this is the other reason for using the rope seed oil. Let's"},"715":{"dur":6,"text":"do the bottom first. Now I'm gonna just get\nkind of half of this on the bottom and half"},"721":{"dur":5,"text":"on the top. And what the rope seed oil does is it kind of within effect keeps the herbs"},"727":{"dur":7,"text":"on the meat. Aw, I can smell those herbs , lovely, absolutely gorgeous. Seriously this is not"},"734":{"dur":7,"text":"difficult okay? That really is, that is good.\nAbsolutely brilliant. Proper sea salt in there"},"742":{"dur":4,"text":"as well. So that's on the bottom because we don't want the bottom to be neglected. And"},"746":{"dur":3,"text":"then what we'll do is sprinkle. Look at those\nbig chunks of salt on there, it's gonna be"},"749":{"dur":4,"text":"lovely in that meat. And the rest of that\non there and then we'll get the old fingers"},"754":{"dur":4,"text":"in there and work that all in. That's it,\nnow start getting all that in there. Make"},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"sure you try and get it down in amongst these little grooves there. It's amazing the colour"},"762":{"dur":4,"text":"it's changing it isn't it? It's giving it\na nice colour as well. Exactly and the rope"},"766":{"dur":3,"text":"seed oil on it is just superb. Also and you'll\nnotice, there is a little bit of Demerara"},"770":{"dur":5,"text":"sugar in here, so that's really undefined\ndererara sugar. Little bit of sweetness. Look"},"776":{"dur":4,"text":"at that, there we go. Get all that in there.\nAnd give it a really good rub and make sure"},"781":{"dur":3,"text":"you get that everywhere. Absolutely perfect. And this is another thing I really. And I"},"784":{"dur":4,"text":"look, move that over, so you can get everything you can on there. We've got a couple more"},"789":{"dur":3,"text":"minutes ready for this chimney starter to\nbe emptied out. We can now start seeing the"},"792":{"dur":4,"text":"flames coming up. Fifteen minutes and you're just starting to see the flames coming up."},"797":{"dur":5,"text":"Often the question we get asked on this is.\nWhen is it ready? When it's just going that"},"802":{"dur":4,"text":"silvery gray, that's the time to start transferring. Don't let it go too far. So we're all good"},"807":{"dur":5,"text":"here to go. Last thing, we've got this. I\nknow a bit of a British thing at the moment."},"812":{"dur":4,"text":"It's great, there's nothing wrong about that.\nSo I've got this. I mean delicious, this is"},"817":{"dur":5,"text":"Henny's dry cider, now I'm not sponsored by them. Are we gonna get paid or not? Well I"},"823":{"dur":5,"text":"dunno but we have got a few more, we'll have one in a minute. So here's another nice thing,"},"828":{"dur":6,"text":"ready? Just get all that in thereYou can smell that as well can't you? I mean look this is"},"834":{"dur":4,"text":"the thing isn't it. Pork and apple sauce.\nWe're gonna do this lovely pork belly and"},"839":{"dur":4,"text":"a lovely cider gravy. I mean, what could be\nbetter than that? Brilliant. Exactly that."},"843":{"dur":4,"text":"And what's gonna happen here is, we're gonna get this lovely bit of pork and plonk that"},"848":{"dur":6,"text":"straight in there. You only just got that\nin there. It is. That's good isn't it. Now"},"854":{"dur":7,"text":"look, waste not want not. Nice little bit\nthere, get all that in there like that. Now"},"864":{"dur":7,"text":"we haven't even this cooked yet. But already smelling that cider. You can smell it can't"},"872":{"dur":3,"text":"you, you can just smell it. Yeah and what's\ngonna happen here is we're cook this, we talked"},"876":{"dur":3,"text":"about doing in-direct didn't we so we're gonna have a slab of coals on either side of the"},"880":{"dur":4,"text":"barbecue, this is going to go right in the\nmiddle, the lid will go on and what we're"},"884":{"dur":3,"text":"gonna do is we're gonna get this kind of convection effect. Yeah. Okay so it's not direct heat"},"888":{"dur":3,"text":"under here. But what's gonna happen is as\nthis all starts cooking , all those juices"},"892":{"dur":5,"text":"start going down into the onions, the carrots and the celery at the same time. That cider"},"897":{"dur":4,"text":"is gonna start to evaporate slowly and all\nthat steam is gonna go up into the pork. It's"},"901":{"dur":4,"text":"gonna be a slow cook isn't it? Exactly and\nthis is what we're on about, high heat first"},"906":{"dur":5,"text":"to get this crackling going, then we'll reduce it down and we'll walk away for 3 to 4 hours"},"911":{"dur":4,"text":"and we'll come back and that'll be done. If\nyou'll pass us those gloves and we'll just"},"915":{"dur":7,"text":"get these briquettes poured. Now these, these are awesome I've got the mitt which are fantastic."},"924":{"dur":4,"text":"Yeah, they're good. Not as good as these.\nThis is a whole another thing though isn't"},"928":{"dur":4,"text":"it. I love the mitt but you've got more control especially with this, as long as you've got"},"933":{"dur":6,"text":"this on the inside, on your palm then it's\ngoing to be perfect. People always say, \"Oh"},"940":{"dur":5,"text":"I'm gonna burn my hands or anything\" but these are fantastic. I'll tell you an interesting"},"945":{"dur":4,"text":"little story about these, when they came out and I've obviously got some now, my wife's"},"949":{"dur":4,"text":"mother is a fantastic cook. But as she's got\na little bit older she's discovered that when"},"954":{"dur":4,"text":"she's using oven gloves that she finds it\na little. A little bit more difficult to get"},"958":{"dur":5,"text":"the grip that she needs and the kind of tactility because it's a big mitt. This is like a standard"},"964":{"dur":6,"text":"pair of oven gloves. I bought her a pair of\nthese for Christmas okay. She absolutely loves"},"970":{"dur":6,"text":"them because she's got. She's got the control. She's got the control, it's really, really,"},"976":{"dur":4,"text":"safe. Literally that is it, she will never\ngo back now. Yeah. They're just brilliant."},"981":{"dur":5,"text":"Absolutely fantastic piece. So I can see now we've got these flames coming up there. So"},"986":{"dur":7,"text":"there's your front handle and then you simply pour don't worry about a few old sparks, my"},"993":{"dur":6,"text":"new shirt on. And this is what's great about\nthis. You can see it, look at the colour of"},"1000":{"dur":7,"text":"that. It's pouring out there and you can pour it exactly where it needs to go. Look at that,"},"1008":{"dur":7,"text":"just superb. Well you just pour half each\nside, then away you go. And if you get the"},"1016":{"dur":7,"text":"odd runaway, big pair of proper barbecue tongs, move that to one side. Remember that this"},"1023":{"dur":6,"text":"hot, so from a health and safety point of\nview always make sure this is put away safely."},"1029":{"dur":4,"text":"This is a really important thing isn't it\nI think one of the places some people go wrong"},"1034":{"dur":6,"text":"and I certainly know this from friends I've\nhad to teach. They don't understand the idea"},"1041":{"dur":4,"text":"of direct and in-direct heat do they? No,\nthey certainly don't. Especially when you're"},"1045":{"dur":3,"text":"cooking chicken legs and things like that,\nthat's where in-direct heat is absolutely"},"1049":{"dur":3,"text":"brilliant because you've not got it directly\nover the top and you can always transfer it"},"1052":{"dur":7,"text":"over. Now, there's my faithful old grate.\nAs you can clearly see. It never gets cleaned."},"1062":{"dur":5,"text":"My wife always has a heart attack when she looks at this, but. In 2 minutes When I've"},"1067":{"dur":4,"text":"got this lid back on, get it up to maximum\nheat and that'll clean off easily. And whilst"},"1072":{"dur":5,"text":"we lift that lid up. Did you know why this\nis here? Well, I do loads of people don't"},"1077":{"dur":4,"text":"do they? Including people who have owned these for several years. Yeah. That is the hook"},"1082":{"dur":4,"text":"and you simply place. Show them Andrew, It is so simple. Right, this is how simple it"},"1087":{"dur":3,"text":"is and it does make you wonder how people don't realise this. There's the little hook,"},"1090":{"dur":5,"text":"so rather than putting this on your grass\nand making a nice burn ring. Simply put it"},"1096":{"dur":4,"text":"like that and do that. Yeah and you always\nknow where the hook is because it's right"},"1101":{"dur":5,"text":"by the vent. Exactly. You just can't go wrong. So put the lid on. So stick that lid on there."},"1107":{"dur":5,"text":"And we're gonna watch that temperature shoot right up. That's gonna take probably 2 or"},"1112":{"dur":3,"text":"3 minutes because the coals are very hot and you can see straight away the temperature"},"1116":{"dur":4,"text":"is coming up and it is gonna come up very\nquickly. That's really starting to go up already."},"1121":{"dur":3,"text":"Those coals have only been on for 15 minutes. Yeah. If anything I could of left them in"},"1125":{"dur":5,"text":"there for a couple more minutes but I'm keen to start to cooking that pork. Exactly. Look"},"1130":{"dur":6,"text":"at that, less than 5 seconds we're running\nup to about 250. It's amazing isn't it. It's"},"1137":{"dur":4,"text":"creeping up very, very quick. Leave that in\nthere for 2 or 3 minutes and then we'll get"},"1141":{"dur":4,"text":"our Weber T Brush out and away we go. And just while we're doing that, I've got to have"},"1145":{"dur":4,"text":"a few words about this background we've got here. Isn't it brilliant? This little gazebo"},"1150":{"dur":7,"text":"is something else isn't it? And this is where\nyou have loads of your customers, they come"},"1157":{"dur":3,"text":"in and they actually cook here don't they.\nOh yeah, we use all the barbecues here and"},"1161":{"dur":4,"text":"you know. We even had a customer who wanted to cook a leg of lamb so we said to him. Right"},"1165":{"dur":4,"text":"all you've got to do is swim over that river\nand there's the sheep over there. But he couldn't"},"1169":{"dur":5,"text":"catch one fortunately. So you bought one instead. So we had to go and buy one. So he then came"},"1174":{"dur":3,"text":"back to cook his leg of lamb. He actually\ncooked it on the big Weber Summit and we use"},"1178":{"dur":3,"text":"this Summit all the time as well. It's beautiful when you are doing rotisserie or things like"},"1182":{"dur":4,"text":"that. So this is the whole point of this,\nisn't it? The barbecue centre is here so that,"},"1186":{"dur":3,"text":"if you're a little bit worried, you've never\ndone it before. You can come and have a go"},"1190":{"dur":4,"text":"on all of these barbecues, so you know which one to buy for you. Yeah, it's perfect. I"},"1194":{"dur":3,"text":"have also noticed you've got a couple of Lamas sitting over here as well. Yeah and a baby."},"1198":{"dur":3,"text":"Is just sitting over there in the field. It's\namazing isn't it. I must admit, I've never"},"1202":{"dur":7,"text":"had lama. I am intrigued. Yeah but could we get away with it? So, anyway. We're already"},"1209":{"dur":5,"text":"up to 400 and it's literally it's just climbing,\nyou can feel the heat coming out of it. You"},"1215":{"dur":5,"text":"see, the heat coming off of these briquettes\nare incredible and that's why I always say."},"1220":{"dur":5,"text":"Don't, whatever you do, buy the cheap briquettes. Every time we get a question. We get lots"},"1225":{"dur":4,"text":"of questions through YouTube. I've bought\na barbecue, it's not performing, it's not"},"1230":{"dur":5,"text":"cooking well and I go straight to the source, charcoal. Where has the charcoal come from?"},"1235":{"dur":5,"text":"I've bought it from a local store and it's\nnot Weber. That's your problem. Forget about"},"1241":{"dur":7,"text":"it. You've got a bag here, that's what's in\nthere. So particularly these, for what we're"},"1248":{"dur":3,"text":"doing here. If we wanna do a low and slow\ncook a good 4 hours or so. Now we're pretty"},"1252":{"dur":4,"text":"much good to do this with 1 set of charcoal. Oh yeah, we'll cook that, no problem at all,"},"1257":{"dur":3,"text":"with that charcoal. Now if you were to buy\na cheap make, you would need to top that up"},"1260":{"dur":4,"text":"at least 3 or 4 times. You're lifting it and\nchanging your temperature all the time. Every"},"1265":{"dur":3,"text":"time the lid comes off the temperature goes\ndown. And whilst you're looking, you're not"},"1268":{"dur":4,"text":"cooking. And that's really important and I\nlearnt that from one of the Weber guys so"},"1273":{"dur":4,"text":"he's gonna be annoyed that I'm using that,\nthat is actually very true. Got his catch"},"1278":{"dur":7,"text":"phrase now, I love it. So we're up to 500\nnow. So really, the heat has increased really,"},"1285":{"dur":3,"text":"really quickly and I'm just gonna give that\nabout another 30 seconds and then I'll be"},"1288":{"dur":6,"text":"ready to clean that grate off. But the answer is, get the right coals and I can't really"},"1295":{"dur":3,"text":"push that point enough. Some of the other\ncoals you can buy have got interesting chemicals"},"1298":{"dur":3,"text":"in them, binding agents, this kind of stuff\nnow you're talking about if you start cooking"},"1302":{"dur":4,"text":"to soon, there's interesting things going\non with your food. But there's none of that"},"1307":{"dur":4,"text":"with this is there? No. This is literally,\nbriquettes and nothing else. That's right."},"1311":{"dur":4,"text":"I don't like cooking things with chemicals,\nit's not right. Right we're ready for this"},"1315":{"dur":5,"text":"you know. I mean look at that, that is literally a couple of minutes, 500 degrees. Just what"},"1321":{"dur":7,"text":"we want. Now, remember. This is where the hook is, by the vent. So, simply do this and"},"1329":{"dur":6,"text":"you can see that is just coming off of there.\nAnd you can see the little bit of smoke coming"},"1336":{"dur":4,"text":"off of the side there, where the bits are\ndropping off. I mean, at the point where you've"},"1340":{"dur":6,"text":"got 500 degrees fahrenheit on there, no bacteria will survive in that. No, no chance. And also"},"1346":{"dur":4,"text":"another thing is, because you are cleaning\nthat with a T Brush, it's dry isn't it? That's"},"1351":{"dur":4,"text":"a big mistake, people that try and clean there barbecue after they've cooked it's full of"},"1356":{"dur":4,"text":"greasy fat and that fat protects the grate\ndoesn't it for a start. Just leave it, forget"},"1360":{"dur":6,"text":"it. And also if you're cleaning a barbecue\nafter you've just cooked, well you're not"},"1367":{"dur":3,"text":"sat down enjoying your food. No. And you're not having a beer. No. Well that's not what"},"1371":{"dur":5,"text":"barbecues about. No not at all, I'm always\namazed that you know. You go to someone's"},"1376":{"dur":4,"text":"house and they've cooked this beautiful meal and then where is he? Oh he's cleaning the"},"1381":{"dur":6,"text":"barbecue. Completely pointless. Absolutely\nmad. If you come here, sometimes we have mould,"},"1388":{"dur":4,"text":"about that thick on the top and does it matter? No it doesn't. And we've proved this, we've"},"1392":{"dur":4,"text":"cooked time after time and look at that grate now, it's clean. Yup, absolutely superb. So"},"1396":{"dur":5,"text":"can quite happily cook of that and it's completely safe. And we're straight back up to 300, let"},"1402":{"dur":4,"text":"that creep into 500 and we're ready to go.\nWe really wanna blast this now don't we, to"},"1406":{"dur":4,"text":"get the crackling going first of all. So the\nset up for the moment with the vents, how"},"1411":{"dur":4,"text":"does that work. So the vents at the moment, we've got them full open. So open at the bottom"},"1415":{"dur":5,"text":"and open at the top. So when we want to reduce our heat, we're gonna simply just turn that"},"1421":{"dur":3,"text":"and reduce the amount of air going through\nand that will reduce our heat down. And we'll"},"1424":{"dur":5,"text":"just check it on our temperature gauge and\nthat's good to go. And on the bottom is that"},"1429":{"dur":5,"text":"pretty simple? Yeah, you've got the vent here which is quite simple and that vent also acts"},"1434":{"dur":5,"text":"as a cleaner. So to get rid of the ash. And\ndrop into the ash catcher. It's beautiful"},"1439":{"dur":5,"text":"because you know, that's the only disadvantage with the Weber Originals is that you can end"},"1445":{"dur":4,"text":"up with the ash dropping onto the open pan and blowing all over the place, which is the"},"1449":{"dur":3,"text":"beauty with this, you know, you don't get\nany problems. So although this one is still"},"1453":{"dur":4,"text":"no problem, just be a bit careful if it is\na windy day. That's right. Exactly. We're"},"1457":{"dur":6,"text":"now up to 500, we're ready to go. Excellent, good stuff. What we'll do, I'll get this put"},"1464":{"dur":4,"text":"it on and then you'll get the lid back on.\nAnd again as always we're saying lid on, do"},"1468":{"dur":4,"text":"what you need to do, sorry lid off. Do what\nyou need to do, get it back on again as quick"},"1472":{"dur":4,"text":"as you can. Yeah, let's go with it. Now that\nalready looks good to me. Yeah. Right, shall"},"1477":{"dur":5,"text":"we go for it. Yeah. Now again I'm gonna place that, here we go. Coals either side, that's"},"1483":{"dur":3,"text":"gonna go right in the middle. So now we get that heat going across and back and we get"},"1486":{"dur":7,"text":"this kind of convection oven type effect.\nNow. Half an hour? Half an hour at 500. Then"},"1494":{"dur":4,"text":"come back and look at that. Yeah. Then we'll have a beer, leave it for 4 hours. Exactly"},"1498":{"dur":7,"text":"500 degrees fahrenheit so about 250 degrees celsius. Yeah. We do need to make that point."},"1506":{"dur":5,"text":"I think it's time for a cider. Shall we wait\nfor the half hour? I don't think I can wait."},"1512":{"dur":4,"text":"No, come on. Let's have a cider. Andrew, this has been on the go for half an hour now at"},"1517":{"dur":7,"text":"about 500 degrees and I can't wait any longer. Yeah the good thing is, we've had the courage"},"1524":{"dur":3,"text":"to not lift the lid and let that temperature\ngo out and that is a real important thing"},"1528":{"dur":3,"text":"about barbecuing. You've got to have the courage to just leave it alone, as soon as you take"},"1532":{"dur":3,"text":"that lid off, all your temperature goes. So\nwe've left it on. Get it off Andrew. This"},"1535":{"dur":5,"text":"is the moment. I love this moment. Can I do the honours? You certainly can. Here we go,"},"1541":{"dur":7,"text":"let's see how we're doing. Oh my god. Look at that. Yeah. Aw that is perfect. Spot on."},"1549":{"dur":3,"text":"Now this is why we got that temperature really high, cause we wanted to really get this crackling"},"1553":{"dur":4,"text":"going. And we're there, I mean. Look at it.\nAlready the smells coming off that, that cider."},"1557":{"dur":6,"text":"I just want to eat it. Yeah, absolutely right.\nCheers. We've had a drink as well. So next"},"1563":{"dur":5,"text":"thing. We now need to do the proper low and slow barbecue now, this is what it's all about."},"1568":{"dur":4,"text":"Get that temperature down from 500 fahrenheit which is 250 degrees c. We wanna get that"},"1573":{"dur":5,"text":"right down to 300-325 fahrenheit that's about 150 degrees. Yeah. And then we low and slow"},"1578":{"dur":7,"text":"that for a good couple of hours now. So lid\nback on and then. What I would say about,"},"1586":{"dur":7,"text":"just reduce the vents by about half. Top and bottom. And that should just about be right."},"1595":{"dur":4,"text":"This is how simple it is isn't it. All you've\ndone there, you've restricted the amount of"},"1599":{"dur":3,"text":"oxygen in, that'll just keep the temperature\ndown a bit. Yeah, you can see the temperature"},"1603":{"dur":3,"text":"is dropping. And all we'll need to do is.\nWe'll keep an eye on that won't we? We'll"},"1607":{"dur":5,"text":"make sure that we get it around 300-325 fahrenheit and you can open up a little bit, close it"},"1613":{"dur":3,"text":"a little bit until we get what you want. So\nbasically again now and again this is just"},"1617":{"dur":5,"text":"for me, the whole point about barbecuing.\nWe can now walk away from that for about 3"},"1622":{"dur":4,"text":"to 4 hours now. And we know that's just gonna do it's own thing, that low and slow and all"},"1626":{"dur":4,"text":"those little connective tissues are gonna\nstart to dissolve and go into that lovely"},"1631":{"dur":4,"text":"gravy we're gonna have later on. So let's\ngo and finish our drinks and we'll come back"},"1635":{"dur":6,"text":"in what? 3 and a half hours? Yeah I think\nso. 3-4 hours. Perfect, lovely. Andrew, 4"},"1641":{"dur":5,"text":"hours later, I don't know about you but I'm\nexcited. Me too, the smells coming out of"},"1646":{"dur":4,"text":"there are amazing. Key point, we've not touched it. Nope. We've just left it, that's the whole"},"1650":{"dur":6,"text":"point of this isn't it, it's super easy. Okay,\nready? Yup. Here we go. Oh look at that. Fantastic!"},"1657":{"dur":6,"text":"And just look at that little, that crackling\nis now perfect. You've got the probe there."},"1663":{"dur":5,"text":"I certainly have. Very, very important. We're looking for anything above 75 degrees right"},"1668":{"dur":5,"text":"in the thickest part of that meat. Yeah, we're 84 and still climbing, so that's cooked well."},"1674":{"dur":4,"text":"So we know, that is absolutely safe to eat\nnow. I can see obviously. Oh yeah definitely,"},"1679":{"dur":4,"text":"it's very important always, every time you\nuse that probe it's very important. So anti"},"1683":{"dur":4,"text":"bacterial wipe, straight back in there, you're\nperfect. Job done. Okay so. Look how much"},"1688":{"dur":4,"text":"coal is still left there. That's still doing\nit's thing isn't it. 4 hours later. Incredible."},"1693":{"dur":5,"text":"And that's why you buy quality coal. Exactly. Or charcoal is this case. Something about"},"1699":{"dur":3,"text":"the tongs, now earlier on we didn't actually\nuse the tongs to handle the meat. I just put"},"1702":{"dur":4,"text":"it in then cleaned my hands, but lets just\nsay you had used the tongs to put the meat"},"1707":{"dur":4,"text":"in this roasting dish okay? What you have\nthere is raw meat on there, so little tip"},"1712":{"dur":4,"text":"again. Hygiene, hygiene, hygiene. Before I\nnow handle this cooked meat, all I do is give"},"1716":{"dur":5,"text":"those a quick wash or again anti bacterial\nwipe. Just give them a clean, it's the simplest"},"1721":{"dur":4,"text":"thing, once you get used to it. This of course is what you'd be doing inside the house, so"},"1726":{"dur":4,"text":"you just do that outside. Okay now. You can see we have got a yellow board now, that's"},"1731":{"dur":5,"text":"the kind of board for cooked meat. This is\nthe slightly tricky bit. Cause this is such"},"1736":{"dur":3,"text":"a big piece of pork belly. We do have to have to be a bit careful with it. So what I'm gonna"},"1740":{"dur":5,"text":"do is I'm gonna try and get right under there with these massive. Look at how juicy that"},"1745":{"dur":4,"text":"is. That is really cooked to perfection. And\nI'm gonna come in here. Now this pork belly"},"1750":{"dur":5,"text":"was on the bone doesn't really make much difference. Aww, now then. Ready? Yeah, I'm ready. Okay"},"1755":{"dur":5,"text":"now get ready for the weight, cause that is\na big piece of pork belly. Oh look at that."},"1760":{"dur":6,"text":"Now, ooh look at that. That's what it's all\nabout. That is fantastic. But the thing about"},"1766":{"dur":4,"text":"this is, this hasn't been much work. No. Cause we haven't done anything, we've just left"},"1771":{"dur":4,"text":"it. What we do need to do now very, very important is to let this rest. A good 20 minutes, half"},"1775":{"dur":3,"text":"an hour because this is such a big piece okay? And all you do when you leave something to"},"1779":{"dur":7,"text":"rest, get a nice bit of foil. The wind is\npicking up a little bit now. It is yeah. It's"},"1786":{"dur":7,"text":"a bit later on in the day, the sun is coming\ndown. Tuck that in there, like that. Perfect."},"1796":{"dur":5,"text":"Now what's gonna happen now is all those lovely juices which are kind of a little bit tight"},"1801":{"dur":4,"text":"at the moment. They're all gonna start to\nrelax back into that. 20 - 30 minutes time"},"1805":{"dur":4,"text":"we'll be good to go and that will still be\nlovely and hot inside. I can't wait. Also."},"1810":{"dur":5,"text":"We talked about doing a lovely cider gravy\ndidn't we. Yeah. So what we had in here as"},"1815":{"dur":5,"text":"we knew from before is carrots, celery, onions, that lovely Henny's dry cider and all that"},"1821":{"dur":6,"text":"steam has been going up into that pork as\nwell, so all that flavour is in there. So"},"1827":{"dur":5,"text":"what I'm gonna do. We've got one of these\nsaucepans, now Weber made these again. Do"},"1833":{"dur":2,"text":"you wanna show me how these work? Have you seen these work? They're brilliant. Absolutely"},"1835":{"dur":6,"text":"fantastic. These handles, you just simply\nclip it in, push that down and there you are."},"1842":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can put that on the barbecue. Take\nthe handle off. Take the handle off and away"},"1845":{"dur":3,"text":"you go and that has a frying pan and all sorts of things. Yeah, exactly and we'll be using"},"1848":{"dur":7,"text":"this in a minute. So what we're gonna do.\nI'll have to scoop this very carefully. And"},"1856":{"dur":5,"text":"what's amazing is it's not oozing of huge\namounts of fat is it. No, no. The fat has"},"1862":{"dur":5,"text":"stayed in the meat. Exactly and crisp up and that lovely crackling as well. Look at those"},"1868":{"dur":4,"text":"vegetables, aren't they fantastic? So what\nI'll do now, I'll just put this down. What"},"1872":{"dur":7,"text":"I'll do now. Thank you very much I'm gonna\nget. I don't like waste Russell. Nor do I."},"1880":{"dur":4,"text":"Get plenty of that in there and all this,\nhas taken up all that flavour, that lovely"},"1884":{"dur":6,"text":"pork. we've got a lot here, you'll get a lot\nof gravy out of this. Isn't that fantastic."},"1891":{"dur":4,"text":"And I've reserved a little bit of that juice,\njust in case we need a bit more. So let's"},"1896":{"dur":5,"text":"leave that there for 2 minutes. Now what we're gonna do, this is a bit of fun. Let's say"},"1901":{"dur":4,"text":"this was like a alternative Sunday lunch or\nsomething like that. You've now got half an"},"1906":{"dur":4,"text":"hour to get everything else ready if you've\ngot some mash potatoes going, some lovely"},"1910":{"dur":5,"text":"bit carrots, honey glazed carrots, that kinda\nthing. So what I'll do now, stick blender."},"1915":{"dur":7,"text":"And I'm just gonna start doing this and look, those vegetables are so soft now. They've"},"1924":{"dur":7,"text":"had kinda of 4-5 hours in there. I mean look, this is so simple. Remember, this is a new"},"1932":{"dur":7,"text":"shirt. So we'll give this a good go. And take\nyour time with it, don't rush. You know, make"},"1941":{"dur":5,"text":"sure you get every single part of that. Now\nif this was me, cause I'm quite chefy. What"},"1946":{"dur":6,"text":"I would be doing now, is I would give this\na really, really good blitz, then I would"},"1952":{"dur":6,"text":"take a sieve, I think you've got one here.\nI'd take the sieve over another saucepan and"},"1959":{"dur":4,"text":"I would put all of this through the sieve\nand I would get a wooden spoon and push it"},"1963":{"dur":4,"text":"all the way through and what that would do, is that would just take out any little tiny"},"1968":{"dur":6,"text":"lumps and what you'll end up with is this\nsuper smooth gravy. Okay. Look at that. It"},"1974":{"dur":3,"text":"really doesn't take long at all, Yeah, I'll\ngive it a really good go cause we wanna make"},"1978":{"dur":5,"text":"sure we don't get any big lumps in there.\nBut do you know what? The question is, it's"},"1984":{"dur":5,"text":"up to you isn't it. If you wanna go to that\nkind of extra effort then please do. Now if"},"1989":{"dur":6,"text":"you put those on for me. This is mixed up\nis quite thick, so I reserved some of that"},"1996":{"dur":3,"text":"liquid, some of that lovely cider so what\nwe're gonna do is we're gonna put a bit more"},"1999":{"dur":6,"text":"in there. And that way, what will happen is\nwe'll just get this to the right consistency."},"2006":{"dur":5,"text":"Yeah. Okay. And seriously this will be, I\nmean that joint there I mean you could get"},"2011":{"dur":5,"text":"10 people out of that, no problem. And this\ngravy as well again, you'll get a good 10"},"2016":{"dur":5,"text":"people out of that. Lovely, so if I get this.\nI'll stop all that coming in, so I'm just"},"2022":{"dur":7,"text":"looking for a bit more of the liquid now.\nThere we go. Wait and you know what, don't"},"2031":{"dur":5,"text":"waste it. You could serve this up as well\ncouldn't you. Oh yeah, on the side, I mean"},"2036":{"dur":7,"text":"it's perfect. Now if you thought that had\na good aroma now, just have a little. Aw,"},"2045":{"dur":5,"text":"I just can't wait to eat this. And what's\nhappened is most of the fat has kind of either"},"2051":{"dur":4,"text":"gone through the meat, we've got that lovely crackling there, crisped up beautifully. But"},"2056":{"dur":4,"text":"a little bit of that fat will have dripped\nthrough, that's flavour, because we're blitzing"},"2060":{"dur":4,"text":"it, it's emulsifying all that together so\nnow we've got this really smooth, lovely sauce."},"2064":{"dur":6,"text":"Or this lovely gravy. Funnily enough I did\nthis a couple of weeks ago, I had a couple"},"2070":{"dur":3,"text":"of friends come over from Florida they live\nin Sarasota. Now so they're american, they"},"2074":{"dur":4,"text":"know their barbecue. So I was taking a big\nrisk by doing something like this with this"},"2078":{"dur":4,"text":"gravy, this is not normally what they would\ndo. They came over, the pork they loved because"},"2083":{"dur":6,"text":"it was just good but when they had some of\nthis, they were blown away. Americans at the"},"2089":{"dur":5,"text":"moment, I've got to say. Americans are much better barbecue in this country, but that's"},"2094":{"dur":1,"text":"what we wanna change isn't it? Yeah definitely, we're not gonna be far behind them. There"},"2096":{"dur":7,"text":"we go. Now I think, that's gonna do. Now again, as I said to you. If you wanted to go the"},"2107":{"dur":4,"text":"extra mile, what you could do there now is\nyou could take that, pass that through a sieve"},"2111":{"dur":4,"text":"and you will get a super smooth, beautiful\ngravy. Yeah. Absolutely delicious. Where should"},"2116":{"dur":6,"text":"we put those? Pit those over there for the\ntime being, there we go. And here's the other"},"2122":{"dur":4,"text":"nice thing. This is the next thing, you mentioned this. I'm gonna get these gloves, I'm gonna"},"2127":{"dur":7,"text":"take our tray out, we've got our coals now\non pretty low. I'll put that there. And this"},"2135":{"dur":2,"text":"is exactly what you said, we want to keep\nthat gravy warm cause we've got another 20"},"2137":{"dur":6,"text":"minutes to wait here haven't we? Yeah. So\nI'll put that there, take my glove off. That's"},"2144":{"dur":7,"text":"it. There you go. It's quite simple and what\nI'm gonna do, I'll put that lid back on but"},"2151":{"dur":3,"text":"now I'm gonna take the opportunity to shut\nthese vents down. Yeah. Cause it's perfect."},"2154":{"dur":4,"text":"That's gonna keep hot in there. Shut them\ndown, so I can maximise on those coals which"},"2158":{"dur":5,"text":"are still there.
