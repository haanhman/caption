I was"},"626":{"dur":6,"text":"basically in an American environment for 12,\n13 hours every day and you learn very fast"},"633":{"dur":4,"text":"when you're a kid like that. And now, I remember\nthe exact moment that I realized I speak English"},"637":{"dur":4,"text":"because we were having a game of kickball\nand outside and they explained to me the rules"},"642":{"dur":6,"text":"but I knew the rules.

That was the moment\nthat I remember it was like that. So the fifth"},"667":{"dur":5,"text":"sort of native language that I had acquired\nas a child was German. I started to have compulsory"},"673":{"dur":7,"text":"German classes in school when I was 12 and\nI failed miserably. I mean, on the first exam"},"681":{"dur":9,"text":"I wrote 16 mistakes.

And"},"741":{"dur":4,"text":"after one summer somehow when you're young,\nyou really learn so fast. So everything just"},"746":{"dur":5,"text":"got activated and yeah, ache basically say\nthat -- of course not now. I speak much worse"},"752":{"dur":5,"text":"German or Hungarian but at that time, I had\nmaybe five languages that I spoke at a native"},"757":{"dur":13,"text":"level by the time I was 13.

And\nshe made me go to her house every Friday after"},"777":{"dur":4,"text":"school while everyone else was out enjoying\nthemselves.

And I had to go to\nher place to talk to her in Hungarian."},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"She spoke Hungarian and then I had to be there\nfor two hours. The first two hours, we would"},"791":{"dur":5,"text":"speak Hungarian and then the other hour, she\nwas trying to teach me some French. The basic"},"796":{"dur":5,"text":"poems, some basic grammar. So I would learn\nat least something. And that was basically"},"802":{"dur":6,"text":"my childhood. And maybe it sounds like it's\nmore... like five languages at such a high"},"808":{"dur":5,"text":"level. It's a little bit more but believe\nme, in my country it was very, very -- it"},"814":{"dur":4,"text":"was a frequently thing that someone spoke\ntwo languages. It wasn't uncommon for someone"},"818":{"dur":4,"text":"to speak three. And everyone had to learn\nEnglish and German in school. So it was a"},"823":{"dur":5,"text":"question of how well did you speak those languages,\nnot how many. I think that was the case. So"},"828":{"dur":7,"text":"I didn't feel any special -- or it didn't\ncross my mind to learn languages because I"},"835":{"dur":5,"text":"wanted to. Why would I, if I could be outside\nwith my friends, why should I be learning"},"840":{"dur":5,"text":"languages? It just really accumulated at that\npoint. And then high school happened. Where"},"846":{"dur":10,"text":"I didn't do much except for party and that.\nAnd there was no incentive to learn more."},"857":{"dur":6,"text":"And all the way to my university studies where\nsuddenly I met people who were really, really"},"863":{"dur":3,"text":"extremely talented, you know, they might have\nspoken better English but this were definitely"},"867":{"dur":7,"text":"people who spoke better German and Hungarian.\nIn Slovakia, maybe other countries have it,"},"874":{"dur":6,"text":"too, bilingual high schools. So basically\nall subjects would be, depending on the high"},"881":{"dur":5,"text":"school, in Italian, English, German, or French\ndepending on what kind of a high school it"},"886":{"dur":6,"text":"was. So these people spoke amazing French\nbecause they had four years of high school"},"893":{"dur":7,"text":"studies in French so it was just unbelievable.\nSo I kind of woke up at that point because"},"900":{"dur":6,"text":"I had an incentive to learn more. And we had\nthe chance to study Spanish and Russian at"},"906":{"dur":5,"text":"the university -- the university of international\nrelations and I failed miserably, I failed"},"912":{"dur":5,"text":"in both, I think Richard Simcott failed too\ngiven the system in which we were learning"},"918":{"dur":6,"text":"the languages. The Spanish classes were at\n7:30 in the morning on Monday in a classroom"},"925":{"dur":6,"text":"that was twice the size of this. 200 people.\nEasily, there with a small teacher, a small"},"931":{"dur":6,"text":"teacher whom I couldn't even hear. And that\ndoesn't even matter how tall she was. I just"},"938":{"dur":3,"text":"couldn't hear. It was so far. And she was\njust reading what was in the textbook. She"},"942":{"dur":6,"text":"was just reading it. And we were expected\nto take the test next week from what we were"},"948":{"dur":5,"text":"talking about. So of course, how can you learn\na language like that? And the Russian words"},"954":{"dur":4,"text":"was -- we didn't have have such a big group.\nThere weren't 200 students. There were maybe"},"958":{"dur":6,"text":"15 of us. But the teacher was too nice. We\ndidn't even study Russian during that course."},"965":{"dur":8,"text":"And I passed the test in Spanish and Russian\nbut I didn't learn neither of the two languages."},"973":{"dur":4,"text":"And it wasn't until I was in my first year\nof masters when I had the chance to go to"},"978":{"dur":8,"text":"Italy on an exchange sort of study.

So I had\na roommate from south Italy, and one guy from"},"1013":{"dur":8,"text":"Milan, and one from Modena. And so the first\nday I bought a book, in Italian. And I started"},"1022":{"dur":5,"text":"reading the dictionary, so the first seven\npages I was reading for three hours. But I,"},"1027":{"dur":3,"text":"you know, 'cause I had the feeling that Italian\nis a very transparent language and I could,"},"1031":{"dur":3,"text":"you know, you can sort of understand when\nyou don't understand so I tried to decipher"},"1035":{"dur":5,"text":"the language on my own and the rest of the\ntime, I would not go to classes, but I would"},"1040":{"dur":3,"text":"talk to my Italian roommates."},"1043":{"dur":6,"text":"And, I think I went to Italy when I was about\n-- it was February in June, it was about first,"},"1050":{"dur":5,"text":"June, I think. I had the first university\noral exam in history. it was history of Eastern"},"1056":{"dur":5,"text":"Europe in Italian.

And then I stayed with\nItalian and I learned more. And I tried to"},"1082":{"dur":6,"text":"develop as much as I could. And a very important\nthing happened in Italy -- I met a guy who's"},"1088":{"dur":5,"text":"very similar to a lot of people who are here\ntoday at the conference. He was very passionate"},"1094":{"dur":5,"text":"about the languages and he was learning languages\nlike Richard said it. He was learning for"},"1099":{"dur":5,"text":"no apparent reason whatsoever. He liked to\nlearn language and he went to his home and"},"1105":{"dur":7,"text":"he had dictionaries in Arabic, in Finnish,\nand in Japanese and I was like, \"Why are you"},"1112":{"dur":4,"text":"learning all these languages?\" And he asked\nme, why didn't you ever learn a difficult"},"1116":{"dur":6,"text":"language? And he had kind of a little... you\nknow, irony in his voice. It's like yeah,"},"1123":{"dur":6,"text":"you speak five, six languages but to Chinese.\nAnd you know, I started to think about it."},"1129":{"dur":7,"text":"And -- for me, that never crossed my mind.\nI'm from Kosice, which is a city of 240,000"},"1137":{"dur":8,"text":"people in the middle of nowhere.

There were\nvery few Chinese people. Some Vietnamese people"},"1155":{"dur":6,"text":"but I didn't know any. And so I never really\nhad the thought cross my mind. I was just"},"1162":{"dur":6,"text":"this guy from Eastern Europe who came to Italy\nand, you know, started to learn Italian but"},"1168":{"dur":4,"text":"it sort of clicked with me and so I said,\n\"All right. Let me try it. Maybe it was really"},"1172":{"dur":4,"text":"just a coincidence that I learned all these\nlanguages.\" And I went back home and I decided"},"1176":{"dur":5,"text":"that I would like to learn either Arabic or\nChinese. And I decided for Arabic. And I started"},"1182":{"dur":6,"text":"looking for Arabic tutors. I found appear\nArabic tutor and she said, fantastic going"},"1189":{"dur":4,"text":"to teach you but I have to go on vacation\nfor two weeks, so is that all right? So I"},"1193":{"dur":4,"text":"said all right. We can start that have. But\nI was so eager to learn a difficult language"},"1198":{"dur":5,"text":"that the next day I had already started researching\nabout Chinese and I started learning Chinese"},"1203":{"dur":4,"text":"and I never learned Arabic, and I became an\ninterpreter for Chinese ten years later. So"},"1207":{"dur":5,"text":"small things like that determine your destiny.\nAnd yeah, so I started learning Chinese but"},"1213":{"dur":4,"text":"I understood that it was going to be too difficult\nto learn on my own. No matter how I looked"},"1217":{"dur":5,"text":"at it. It was just too hard and I realized\nthat I would have to go to Taiwan or China"},"1223":{"dur":5,"text":"and spend some time there. And I graduated\nwith my masters from the university that I"},"1229":{"dur":5,"text":"was at. In international relations. I took\na year after. Came to New York, worked in"},"1234":{"dur":5,"text":"Times Square. Tried to learn Spanish. The\nway I did, I was commuting to New York. It"},"1240":{"dur":2,"text":"took me an hour and during that hour, I would\nlisten to Spanish news. And I didn't speak"},"1242":{"dur":7,"text":"a word of Spanish. But it was so transparent\nso what I tried to do was without a dictionary"},"1250":{"dur":5,"text":"or anything, tried to understand the news.\nJust concentrate really, really hard. And"},"1256":{"dur":3,"text":"with the knowledge of Italian and English\nsort of understand what they're talking about."},"1259":{"dur":7,"text":"And unbelievably it word. I first started\nto separate the sentences and separate the"},"1266":{"dur":4,"text":"words, and then individually find the words\ntrauma Italian, and have them sort of demask"},"1270":{"dur":6,"text":"itself and then I had colleagues from the\nDominican Republic and Panama, and I would"},"1277":{"dur":7,"text":"have them read books in Spanish. And after\na few months.

I certainly"},"1297":{"dur":5,"text":"do speak fantastic Spanish when I thought\nI was okay. And I thought that I wanted to"},"1303":{"dur":9,"text":"go to a Spanish-speaking country. I came back.\nAnd I started listening to a lot of Russian."},"1313":{"dur":4,"text":"Almost eight hours a day of Russian news.\nAnd same thing no dictionary. Well, actually"},"1317":{"dur":6,"text":"I did use a dictionary already. And same thing\nabout a month in, Russian is very close to"},"1324":{"dur":4,"text":"Slovak and Czech so it was easier. Easier\nto understand but not so easy to speak. I"},"1328":{"dur":7,"text":"went to Russia I was there for one month.\nAnd yeah, it was pretty much enough to get"},"1335":{"dur":6,"text":"to the level that I wanted to. Again I don't\nspeak fabulous Russian. I mean, I have friends"},"1342":{"dur":4,"text":"who can testify to that. But when I'm really\npracticing, when I'm really at my best, C1"},"1346":{"dur":7,"text":"level, C1 +, maybe especially because it's\nso close to Slovak. And then the big decision"},"1354":{"dur":8,"text":"came to go to Taiwan to learn Chinese but\nany way I looked at it it was too expensive."},"1362":{"dur":6,"text":"It cost me about 20, 30,000 U.S. dollars.\nI mean, I'm going to find a different way"},"1368":{"dur":4,"text":"around it. And my friend, a Czech friend told\nme, why don't you try to study Chinese at"},"1372":{"dur":6,"text":"the Chinese department in Prague? 'Cause the\nrelations between Czech Republic and Slovakia"},"1378":{"dur":6,"text":"are fantastic. So if you pass the exam for\nany Czech university, you get in for free."},"1384":{"dur":5,"text":"You can get into the dorm, and scholarship.\nYou just have to pass the test and the ratio"},"1389":{"dur":9,"text":"between who actually get in, and who wanted\nto, was terrible. Only 15 pass. Just that?"},"1399":{"dur":8,"text":"And I passed. I was 15th. I was the last person\nwho would get in. So a very small thing that"},"1408":{"dur":7,"text":"would determine your entire future. So I would\nbe in Prague, studying Chinese and Chinese"},"1415":{"dur":5,"text":"literature, classical Chinese which is another\nlanguage. But I think that -- yeah, it's difficult"},"1421":{"dur":5,"text":"to say how well you can speak a dead language\nbecause it's hard but I was working on a dictionary"},"1427":{"dur":5,"text":"of Chinese characters and etymology when I\nwas working with materials only written in"},"1432":{"dur":6,"text":"classical Chinese.

For me, always when I was learning\na language, and, I guess, as I explained it,"},"1523":{"dur":4,"text":"was to be completely fluent in it. Like, to\nbe able to read anything I want.

And after five"},"1555":{"dur":6,"text":"years when I was really, really exhausted,\nI said, yeah, that's probably enough. So I"},"1562":{"dur":7,"text":"decided to go back home.
