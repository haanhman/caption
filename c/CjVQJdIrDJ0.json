It is true of impression.\nAnd it is true in general what we call intuitive"},"402":{"dur":7,"text":"thinking. It just happens. It comes from somewhere.\nAnd we are not the author of it. Now, there"},"409":{"dur":6,"text":"is another way that thoughts come to mind\nand here I suppose essentially nothing came"},"416":{"dur":9,"text":"to your mind, but the answer is 408. To produce\nthe 408, requires a completely different kind"},"425":{"dur":5,"text":"of operation. You have to retrieve the program\nthat you learned in school. The program consists"},"431":{"dur":5,"text":"of steps. You have to go through the steps.\nYou've got to pay attention successively to"},"436":{"dur":4,"text":"partial products and so on. And keep things\nin mind and keep the whole program in mind."},"441":{"dur":5,"text":"This is how it works. This is something that\nyou do. It is not something that happens to"},"446":{"dur":11,"text":"you. And there are many indications that this\nis how it works. One is that Physiology indicates"},"457":{"dur":4,"text":"and this is how it works: pupil dilates. This\nis something that I studies many, many years"},"462":{"dur":5,"text":"ago that people really on a program like that\nif you're on a problem like that if you're"},"467":{"dur":8,"text":"going to do it in your head, your pupil will\ndilate.

And it will\nstay dilated as long as you're working and"},"481":{"dur":7,"text":"it will sort of collapse back to normal size\neither when you quit or when you find the"},"488":{"dur":5,"text":"answer. So this is another way thoughts come\nto mind. And this is definitely not the intuitive"},"494":{"dur":6,"text":"way. Here we are we feel a sense of urgency.\nWe feel something deliberate is happening"},"501":{"dur":7,"text":"and a very important aspect of it this is\neffortful and what psychologists mean by effort"},"508":{"dur":6,"text":"is basically, if you want the quick introduction\nto what effort is, this is something you cannot"},"515":{"dur":6,"text":"do while making a left turn into traffic.\nYou cannot do it and you shouldn't try. And"},"521":{"dur":6,"text":"the reason is that there is limited capacity\nto exert effort. And if you are engaged that"},"527":{"dur":9,"text":"capacity or those resources at one task less\nis available for another task. Now, there"},"537":{"dur":5,"text":"is another function of System 2. And here\nI'm going to tell you a riddle. Most of you"},"542":{"dur":7,"text":"are familiar with it. A bat and a ball together\ncosts 1.10. The bat costs more than the ball."},"549":{"dur":6,"text":"Of course how much does the ball cost? How\nmany people know this riddle by the way? Oh,"},"556":{"dur":6,"text":"okay. So it's still usable. The point about\nthis riddle is that the number came to your"},"562":{"dur":8,"text":"mind. And the number is ten cents. And everybody\njust, I think. Maybe here they're exception,"},"570":{"dur":4,"text":"very few exceptions. People confess that the\nnumber ten cents immediately came to mind."},"575":{"dur":8,"text":"Now, it's wrong. Ten cents and dollar 10 is\na dollar 20. The solution is five cents. What"},"584":{"dur":10,"text":"is interesting here is that at Princeton,\nat MIT at Harvard and I don't know about Stanford"},"595":{"dur":7,"text":"or CalTech about 50% of students asked this\nquestion of undergraduates say ten cents."},"603":{"dur":6,"text":"And we learn something very interesting when\nsomebody says ten cents. We learn that they"},"609":{"dur":7,"text":"didn't check because if they had checked,\nthey wouldn't say ten cents. So, there is"},"616":{"dur":6,"text":"a sense of confidence that people have that\nthese people in particular have and it brings"},"623":{"dur":7,"text":"us to another function of what I'll call System\n2. System 1 is the intuitive one; they perform"},"630":{"dur":10,"text":"those automatic and activities and System\n2 is the effortful one the one that the deliberate"},"640":{"dur":7,"text":"one. And the reason that I classify this as\nSystem 2 operation is that self-control and"},"648":{"dur":7,"text":"controlling your attention and deliberate\nexertion of effort are impaired when by other"},"655":{"dur":9,"text":"activities. So, if for example, a trivial\nexample, if somebody is asked to retain seven"},"664":{"dur":5,"text":"digits in their head and you then give them\na choice between chocolate cake, sinful chocolate"},"670":{"dur":5,"text":"cake and virtuous fruit salad they're more\nlikely to choose the chocolate cake than they"},"675":{"dur":5,"text":"would if they didn't have seven digits in\ntheir head. It takes effort to control your"},"680":{"dur":10,"text":"impulses even such mild impulses as a preference\nfor chocolate cake. So"},"691":{"dur":5,"text":"you should be aware of that difference between\nSystem 1 operations, the automatic ones and"},"697":{"dur":7,"text":"System 2 operations, the deliberate ones,\nit comes very clearly when in driving. So"},"704":{"dur":7,"text":"driving is a skill. And any skilled activity\nmeasure of skill is that things begin to happen"},"711":{"dur":7,"text":"automatically. So you can drive and conduct\na conversation. You cannot make a left turn"},"718":{"dur":6,"text":"into traffic, but by and large, we can drive\nand talk. So driving is largely automatic."},"725":{"dur":5,"text":"Braking, when there is any sign of danger,\nbraking is completely automatic. That is,"},"731":{"dur":6,"text":"you can notice while you're braking, but you\nfirst respond so that the response is immediate,"},"737":{"dur":8,"text":"it is fully automatic. Now, in some places,\nnot here where people drive in snow or ice,"},"746":{"dur":7,"text":"they learn about skids. And then, occasionally,\nyou'll find yourself as a driver in a skid."},"753":{"dur":5,"text":"And then System 2 will be mobilized because\nin a skid you're not supposed to do anything"},"758":{"dur":5,"text":"that comes naturally to you. You shouldn't\nbrake and you shouldn't steer away from the"},"763":{"dur":4,"text":"skid. You should leave the brakes alone and\nsteer into the skid, completely non-intuitive."},"768":{"dur":8,"text":"Now, when people have a lot of practice with\nskids that too becomes automatic. So one thing"},"777":{"dur":6,"text":"that we can tell about System 1 and System\n2 those two types of operations, is some of"},"783":{"dur":7,"text":"the basic innate operations, functions that\nwe have such as having emotional reactions"},"791":{"dur":8,"text":"to things, all this is System 1. We don't\nchoose to do it. It just happens to us. But"},"799":{"dur":8,"text":"also System 1 is where skill is. That is when\nwe get to be skilled at something it becomes"},"808":{"dur":6,"text":"automatic and it demands your resources and\nwe get to be very good at it. Now, the issue"},"814":{"dur":6,"text":"of intuition and here I'm not sure, but I\nsuspect that Malcolm Gladwell really did us"},"821":{"dur":5,"text":"a disservice by giving us a sense there is\nmagic to intuition. There really is no magic"},"826":{"dur":8,"text":"at all and we should understand how it works.\nIntuition and Herbert Simon who was Psychologist"},"834":{"dur":5,"text":"then and economist and a political scientist\nNobel Laureate, Herbert Simon gave a very"},"840":{"dur":6,"text":"good definition about what intuition is. It\nis simply recognition. There is really no"},"846":{"dur":5,"text":"difference between the physician recognizing\na disease, you know, a particular disease"},"852":{"dur":6,"text":"from a facial expression or something and\na little child learning, pointing to something"},"858":{"dur":5,"text":"and saying doggie. The little child has no\nidea what the clues are but he just said."},"864":{"dur":8,"text":"He just knows this is dog without knowing\nwhy he knows. And once you think about it"},"873":{"dur":7,"text":"this way, this really demystifies intuition\nto a very considerable extent. And it also"},"880":{"dur":6,"text":"leads you to sort of a solution to the problem\nGary Klein and I were trying to solve. When"},"886":{"dur":7,"text":"can you trust intuition and when can't you?\nAnd then it becomes an issue of is the world"},"893":{"dur":9,"text":"regular enough so that you can learn to recognize\nthings? Or and then did that particular individual"},"902":{"dur":7,"text":"have an opportunity to learn the regularities\nof the world? And so, the world of chess players"},"909":{"dur":5,"text":"is highly regular. And statistically, the\nworld of poker players is very regular. So"},"914":{"dur":7,"text":"there is an element of chance, but there are\nrules and the mind is so set that if there"},"922":{"dur":6,"text":"are rules in the environment and we're exposed\nto them for a long time, and we get immediate"},"928":{"dur":6,"text":"feedback on what is right and wrong, or fairly\nimmediate feedback, we would acquire those"},"934":{"dur":9,"text":"rules. So all of us have expert intuition\neven if we are not physicians and we're not"},"943":{"dur":9,"text":"master chess players. I recognize my wife's\nmood from one word on the telephone. You know,"},"953":{"dur":5,"text":"most of you can do that. There's people that\nyou know very well. All of us recognize dangerous"},"958":{"dur":6,"text":"driver on the next lane. And you know we get\ncues and we don't necessarily know what is"},"965":{"dur":6,"text":"the cue but this person is driving erratically\nand could do something dangerous. And this"},"971":{"dur":9,"text":"is a lot of reinforced practice and we're\nvery good at that. We can learn about those,"},"980":{"dur":10,"text":"there are differences. Among experts, among\nprofessionals, in the level of expertise that"},"991":{"dur":5,"text":"they have and they depend in the level of\nintuitive expertise that they can develop."},"997":{"dur":6,"text":"So for example, compare anesthesiologists\nto radiologists. Anesthesiologists get very"},"1003":{"dur":5,"text":"good feedback, an immediate feedback whenever\nthey do anything wrong. You know they have"},"1009":{"dur":8,"text":"those measurements in real time. Radiologists\nget really miserable feedback about whether"},"1017":{"dur":5,"text":"they're right or wrong. So you could expect\nan anesthesiologist to develop intuition much"},"1023":{"dur":7,"text":"more than you would expect radiologist to\ndevelop intuition. And so, that is part of"},"1030":{"dur":7,"text":"the answer about intuitive expertise. We don't\nneed to disagree about that because we know"},"1038":{"dur":6,"text":"pretty much when intuitive expertise is likely\nto develop. And as I said, we also that means"},"1044":{"dur":6,"text":"that intuitive expertise is not going to develop\nin a chaotic universe or in a chaotic world."},"1051":{"dur":9,"text":"So for example, I personally do not believe\nthat that's stopped because people pick stocks"},"1060":{"dur":6,"text":"to invest in can develop intuition because\nsimply the market takes care of it. There"},"1067":{"dur":5,"text":"isn't enough regularity in what's going to\nhappen to prices for intuitions to develop."},"1073":{"dur":6,"text":"We also know about political forecasters when\nthey forecast long-term, they are really no"},"1080":{"dur":6,"text":"better than a dart-throwing monkey.

It is really"},"1100":{"dur":6,"text":"not their fault that they cannot predict the\nlong range future 10 or 15 years. They are"},"1106":{"dur":5,"text":"quite good at short-term predictions. They\nare really not good at all in long-term predictions."},"1111":{"dur":6,"text":"It's not their fault. It's the fault of the\nworld. The world is probably not predictable."},"1118":{"dur":5,"text":"And if the world is not predictable, then\nyou are not going to predict it. When there"},"1123":{"dur":7,"text":"are marginal situations where there is some\npredictability but poor formulas do better"},"1130":{"dur":7,"text":"than individuals. That is the domain where\nformulas beat individuals regularly is a domain"},"1138":{"dur":5,"text":"of fairly low predictability. Because when\nthere are weak cues, people are not very good"},"1143":{"dur":7,"text":"at picking them up and are not good at using\nthem consistently.

Okay."},"1159":{"dur":7,"text":"Now, I've introduced you to System 1 and System\n2 and I've told you something about skill"},"1166":{"dur":13,"text":"and about skill in System 1.

I use System 1 and System 2\nthose terms and very shocking terms in my"},"1235":{"dur":6,"text":"discipline. You are really not supposed to\ndo that. Because every psychologist gets told"},"1242":{"dur":5,"text":"fairly early you're not supposed to explain\nwhat happens in the mind by invoking little"},"1248":{"dur":5,"text":"agents inside the mind and explain what the\nmind does by what the little agents do. Those"},"1253":{"dur":7,"text":"are homunculi and that's a bad word in psychology.\nI'm going to use System 1 and System 2 absolutely"},"1261":{"dur":9,"text":"as homunculi.

That\nis, the confidence that we experience is a"},"2239":{"dur":14,"text":"judgment of probability. Now, I'm going to\nskip the other example.

And that people are confident in judgments"},"2262":{"dur":8,"text":"that are not necessarily true. And I would\nlike to sort of present a tentative theory"},"2270":{"dur":7,"text":"about how that happened. And the general idea\nis very straightforward.

The\nquestion here would be, \"Which of the three"},"2410":{"dur":12,"text":"figures is larger on the screen?\" And the\nanswer is, \"they're equal.\" All three figures"},"2423":{"dur":7,"text":"on the screen are of equal size.
