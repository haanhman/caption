poverty and"},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"the engineering skills that,\nwhat little I may have had."},"451":{"dur":4,"text":"And I decide, well let me go back to\nPeru and take a break from academics,"},"455":{"dur":3,"text":"probably for 10 months, a year, and\nthen probably go back to an academic job."},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I thought I'd apply for\na Fulbright

before the Internet, and"},"483":{"dur":3,"text":"I realized that they\nspeak English in Kenya."},"486":{"dur":4,"text":"And I flipped my application\nto go to Kenya [LAUGH] and"},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"got lucky enough to get a Fulbright."},"493":{"dur":4,"text":"And went down to Kenya, this was back\nin 1985 and yes, I was young and"},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"good looking once too, so."},"499":{"dur":4,"text":"[LAUGH] And I went to Kenya."},"503":{"dur":4,"text":"Which is, of course,\nin sub-Saharan Africa."},"507":{"dur":6,"text":"And really which is one of the world's\nvery, very poorest places."},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"You've got a population of about\n1.1 billion people living there."},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"Almost half of them live\nbelow the poverty

Africa by 2100."},"549":{"dur":4,"text":"Now this is assuming, this assumptions\nare assuming that every woman and"},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"girl alive today only has two children."},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"And the reason for this is, cuz you've\ngot a huge number of youngsters, and"},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"very few old people."},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"So you got a population\nthat looks like this now."},"563":{"dur":1,"text":"You can imagine, if that fills in."},"565":{"dur":3,"text":"So you got 3 billion people\nextra in Africa by 2100."},"568":{"dur":3,"text":"Only one billion more people\nin the rest of the world."},"572":{"dur":3,"text":"But clearly, the challenge in\nAfrica is absolutely huge."},"575":{"dur":4,"text":"I always say that, we'll be able to walk\nacross the Mediterranean Sea on rubber"},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"dinghys at that time."},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"You won't need to actually\nget your own boat."},"582":{"dur":3,"text":"There'll be so\nmany people coming to Europe."},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"So already you've got a continent\nthat can't feed itself, and"},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"is growing very rapidly."},"589":{"dur":0,"text":"So something has to be done."},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"So then I didn't really know what, but"},"593":{"dur":3,"text":"I went down on my Fulbright fellowship\nto look at poverty and technology."},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"I thought that I'd jump right into\nthe appropriate technology movement,"},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"which is a movement that\nstarted in the 80s or"},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"70s when Schumacher wrote\na book Small Is Beautiful."},"604":{"dur":4,"text":"Everybody got very excited about local\nsmall scale technology to help the poor."},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"And I thought I'd jump right into that,\nbut in 1985, it turned out,"},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"that was old news."},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"Nobody cared about that anymore, and"},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"nobody was working on technology for\npoverty alleviation."},"618":{"dur":3,"text":"Many lessons that had not been\nlearned about why it didn't work."},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"But nonetheless, that's what happened."},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I did find a small group\nat a place called ActionAid,"},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"which is a nonprofit similar\nto Save the Children."},"629":{"dur":1,"text":"And I met a man there called Nick Moon."},"631":{"dur":3,"text":"And Nick was a carpenter and\nan entrepreneur,"},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"who was now building low\ncost primary schools."},"637":{"dur":3,"text":"And I joined him as a volunteer to\nbegin with for a couple years and"},"641":{"dur":3,"text":"then later as a job, and\nan ActionAid I did a number of things."},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"As you've heard little bit about, but\nI established one became one of the very"},"647":{"dur":4,"text":"largest world water programs in Kenya,\nwhere we're going to rural communities,"},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"we dig wells, put in pumps,\nwe build a water catchments."},"656":{"dur":3,"text":"And that was a very big\nprogram that I ran there."},"660":{"dur":5,"text":"I helped youth groups and women's group to\nget into employment, working as groups."},"666":{"dur":4,"text":"I set up a couple rural workshops where\nwe mass produced farm equipment into"},"670":{"dur":4,"text":"specially ox drawn plows, and arrows and\nox carts and we gave them away to farmers."},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"But so often with my academic training,\nI look back on it and"},"677":{"dur":3,"text":"I realize, very often we were\nactually not having much impact?"},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"And sometimes actually doing\nmore damage than good."},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"Putting a nice clean\nwater point in a village."},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"It turns out, doesn't actually do\na whole lot for health by itself."},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"Because by the time the water gets home,\nit's dirty."},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"But much more than that\nis we would come in,"},"695":{"dur":3,"text":"we would put this in place, we would\ntrain the community look after them, but"},"699":{"dur":3,"text":"by the time it broke down of course\nall that training had been forgotten."},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"And africa is leaded with about 200,000,"},"705":{"dur":3,"text":"300,000 broken down\ncommunity border points,"},"708":{"dur":4,"text":"we continue to put them in over one side\nput in back in the 80s, 90s are gone."},"713":{"dur":3,"text":"So giving farm equipment away sounds\nlike a nice idea, but of course,"},"716":{"dur":4,"text":"the farmers maybe don't appreciate it that\nmuch cuz it might not have been what they"},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"wanted in the beginning."},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"But much worse than that, there's a guy\ndown the road producing farm equipment and"},"725":{"dur":1,"text":"of course, we put him out of business."},"727":{"dur":4,"text":"And then, when the project runs out,\nthere's no farm equipment locally."},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"Building low cost schools is nice,\nbut it's not actually"},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"the highest priority to get the building,\nyou don't have any teachers."},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"And youth groups and women's groups,\ngreat to set them up in businesses,"},"741":{"dur":3,"text":"but the truth is, it's very difficult\nto run a business as a group."},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"Even running a business with\ntwo people is difficult."},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we would hold their hands and\neverything and it would work, but"},"750":{"dur":1,"text":"the minute we let go it would fall apart."},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"And meanwhile there's an entrepreneur down\nthe road, who would like to have started"},"755":{"dur":2,"text":"a business and\nwe were keeping him out of the business."},"757":{"dur":1,"text":"So learn a lot about what doesn't work and"},"759":{"dur":4,"text":"a few things about what do work, but\nindividual family owned is best."},"764":{"dur":3,"text":"Sell products, don't give them away\nbecause it's fairer, it's cheaper and"},"768":{"dur":1,"text":"it's more sustainable."},"769":{"dur":4,"text":"I became, when I went over probably\na socialist thinking I'm gonna go and"},"774":{"dur":4,"text":"help and I became sort of a small\nfee capitalist, realizing that is"},"778":{"dur":3,"text":"actually the job and other things\nthat that are gonna help more."},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"But the other thing you learned in\ndevelopment, is nothing scaled with sorts"},"784":{"dur":3,"text":"of islands of success,\nsmall things that work on small scale."},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"But nothing is really having an impact\non a large scale in development."},"793":{"dur":4,"text":"So, the biggest lesson I learned though,\nwas something when I really asked"},"797":{"dur":3,"text":"the question is,\nwhat did the poor want and need?"},"800":{"dur":1,"text":"What do they actually want and need?"},"801":{"dur":1,"text":"Well it was a long list."},"803":{"dur":2,"text":"Not that long, but they need food\nobviously, staples and processed."},"805":{"dur":1,"text":"They need farm inputs, and tools."},"807":{"dur":6,"text":"They need clothing and shelter, education,\nhealthcare, cooking fuel, lighting,"},"814":{"dur":6,"text":"transport, communication, things like\nsoap and cosmetics, water and sanitation."},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not a very long list but\nthese are the things that people want,"},"823":{"dur":1,"text":"just living their lives."},"824":{"dur":4,"text":"But the number one need, if anyone is\npoor anywhere in the world is really only"},"829":{"dur":2,"text":"one thing and\nthat is a way to make more money."},"833":{"dur":2,"text":"Because all of these things\non the list above cost money."},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"Bottom line is, if you have\na way to make money, guess what?"},"839":{"dur":0,"text":"You can get all these things."},"840":{"dur":3,"text":"If you don't, you never will and\nyou'll never get out of poverty."},"844":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's great."},"845":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, the world's most urgent problem"},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"is the fact that something like\n2.5 billion people in the world,"},"851":{"dur":3,"text":"500 million families,\nneed a way to make a lot more money."},"855":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's not that they're making no many,\nthey're making some money, but"},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"they're just not making it enough."},"861":{"dur":2,"text":"And so people think that the formal\nprivate sector is gonna help solve this"},"864":{"dur":2,"text":"problem, by creating big\ncompanies that create jobs."},"867":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's a nice idea."},"868":{"dur":4,"text":"But if you look in Kenya, 7% of the labor\nforce works in the formal private sector."},"873":{"dur":3,"text":"Tanzania at 3.5%."},"876":{"dur":1,"text":"Sudan is 1.5%."},"878":{"dur":4,"text":"But even in India, which we think of\nas a developed country, is only 10%."},"883":{"dur":2,"text":"We're working in\nthe formal private sector."},"885":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's great that we\nstart big businesses,"},"886":{"dur":3,"text":"but that's not actually solving\nthe problem for unemployment."},"889":{"dur":1,"text":"So what is solving the problem."},"891":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, it's actually the people who\nare solving the problem themselves."},"894":{"dur":1,"text":"They need money, they're entrepreneurial."},"895":{"dur":1,"text":"They have to be just to survive."},"897":{"dur":0,"text":"So what do they do?"},"898":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, they grow crops if they're farmers."},"900":{"dur":2,"text":"And they sell the crops, because they need\nthe money more than they need the food."},"906":{"dur":3,"text":"And then later on of course\nthey have to buy back food."},"910":{"dur":2,"text":"And they all plant at the same time,\nthey all grow at the same time."},"913":{"dur":1,"text":"They sell into the same market."},"914":{"dur":2,"text":"Of course, they don't make a lot\nof money when they do that."},"917":{"dur":1,"text":"But they make a little bit."},"919":{"dur":1,"text":"Or they join the informal sector."},"920":{"dur":1,"text":"Now the informal sector,"},"921":{"dur":4,"text":"which is where most people work, is made\nup primarily of people doing petty trade."},"926":{"dur":3,"text":"People sitting on the side of the road\nbuying and selling the same things."},"929":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm doing the same, you're doing the same,\nwe're all doing the same."},"931":{"dur":3,"text":"Our margins are tiny,\nwe're making a little bit of money, but"},"935":{"dur":1,"text":"we're not making a lot."},"936":{"dur":3,"text":"Or if it's not petty trade, there's a list\nof about ten other businesses that people"},"940":{"dur":2,"text":"do, metal work, carpentry,\ntailoring, food preparation."},"943":{"dur":4,"text":"There's a list of about ten and that's 99%\nof the informal sector, everybody doing"},"947":{"dur":4,"text":"the same thing, competing with each other,\nmaking very small margins and staying in"},"951":{"dur":5,"text":"poverty, surviving, yes, because they make\na little bit, but not escaping poverty."},"956":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you look at that from\na business point of view."},"960":{"dur":0,"text":"What's the problem?"},"962":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, the problem is that they're\nall in the wrong business."},"965":{"dur":1,"text":"Right, because they're\nall doing the same thing."},"967":{"dur":2,"text":"And kind of not suprising,\nhey it's even hard for"},"969":{"dur":3,"text":"us, the best educated people in the world\nto come up with a new business idea."},"974":{"dur":4,"text":"Obviously much harder for the target\naudience that we're talking about here."},"979":{"dur":2,"text":"And even if they can come up\nwith a new business idea,"},"981":{"dur":3,"text":"they can't access the tools and equipment\nthey need to make that business viable."},"984":{"dur":1,"text":"That is what we realize."},"986":{"dur":2,"text":"Those tools and\nequipment are not available,"},"989":{"dur":4,"text":"certainly not where they are, and\nvery often, not anywhere in the world."},"993":{"dur":2,"text":"So, they need help identifying\nthose businesses and"},"995":{"dur":2,"text":"accessing the right technologies for\nthose businesses."},"999":{"dur":4,"text":"So Nick and I at ActionAid we told our\nbosses this is what had to happen and"},"1003":{"dur":3,"text":"that we needed to do this kind of work,\ndesigning technology for"},"1006":{"dur":1,"text":"people to start businesses."},"1008":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, they didn't like that idea very\nmuch and they asked us to leave."},"1012":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact they kinda charged me\nwith gross insubordination."},"1015":{"dur":1,"text":"I had to look at up in the dictionary."},"1016":{"dur":5,"text":"[LAUGH] And I had to leave ActionAid,\nas did Nick."},"1022":{"dur":4,"text":"But we managed to convince them to\nlet us stay for about six months."},"1026":{"dur":4,"text":"And in that time, we established\na what was back then a

their founders and\nI didn't do"},"1047":{"dur":2,"text":"anything about it at the time because they\nnever thought they would go very far."},"1051":{"dur":3,"text":"That's why I'm not an investor

oil,"},"1528":{"dur":3,"text":"was a machine for making cooking oil,\nlow cost cooking oil, in the rural area."},"1531":{"dur":1,"text":"Now if you're a farmer and"},"1532":{"dur":3,"text":"you grow sunflower seed,\nyou can't process it yourself."},"1536":{"dur":3,"text":"So you sell it to a middle man, who sells\nit to the factory, who processes it,"},"1539":{"dur":2,"text":"who brands it, who

cheaper."},"1560":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we had a machine for\nmaking cooking oil out of sunflower seed."},"1563":{"dur":1,"text":"A very profitable business too."},"1564":{"dur":1,"text":"We sold thousands of those."},"1565":{"dur":1,"text":"You also get the animal\nfeed as a nice byproduct."},"1569":{"dur":1,"text":"And then a machine for bailing hay."},"1570":{"dur":3,"text":"It turns out that bailing hay is\na great business in East Africa."},"1574":{"dur":3,"text":"Because if you have a farm, you wanna\nkeep a cow so you can milk your cow."},"1578":{"dur":6,"text":"If you let that cow graze, guess what,\nit eats all your crops in the crop season."},"1584":{"dur":4,"text":"So you have to keep it in a cage and\nthen you have to buy fodder to feed it."},"1589":{"dur":2,"text":"And in the dry season,\nyou have to buy hay."},"1591":{"dur":3,"text":"And hay has to be baled, otherwise\nit rots in order to transport it."},"1594":{"dur":4,"text":"And I just got back from Kenya last week,\nand right now in the dry season,"},"1598":{"dur":3,"text":"one bale of hay is selling for\n$5 on the side of the road."},"1602":{"dur":2,"text":"Because only people who can bale\nit are the big

days."},"1622":{"dur":2,"text":"Anyway, so\nthat sold hundreds of those machines too."},"1625":{"dur":3,"text":"And we said great, so we can create\ntens of thousands of businesses, but"},"1629":{"dur":1,"text":"we need to create millions."},"1632":{"dur":3,"text":"What business can millions\nof people in Africa start"},"1635":{"dur":1,"text":"that's gonna be very profitable?"},"1636":{"dur":2,"text":"What is that business, right?"},"1638":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, it turns out that 40% of\nthe people in the world and"},"1642":{"dur":5,"text":"80% of the poor in Africa are one thing,\nand that is small holder rural farmers."},"1647":{"dur":3,"text":"And they're struggling on small plots of\nland with very primitive tools just to"},"1651":{"dur":3,"text":"make a living, with their machete and\ntheir handheld hoe."},"1654":{"dur":4,"text":"And so what business can they start,\nright, to make a lot of money?"},"1659":{"dur":4,"text":"Well it turns out that in Sub-Saharan\nAfrica, by far the best way for millions"},"1664":{"dur":4,"text":"of farmers to start a business and\nmake a lot more money is one simple thing."},"1668":{"dur":5,"text":"And that is to move from rain fed\nfarming to irrigated farming."},"1673":{"dur":0,"text":"And the reason for"},"1674":{"dur":3,"text":"this is right now, they all plant at\nthe same time when the rains come."},"1678":{"dur":1,"text":"They all harvest at the same time."},"1679":{"dur":1,"text":"They can't sell to their neighbors."},"1681":{"dur":1,"text":"That's their market,\nthey're other poor people."},"1683":{"dur":1,"text":"They can't sell to them,\ncuz they have a crop too."},"1685":{"dur":2,"text":"So they're stuck selling to middle men,\nget very low prices,"},"1687":{"dur":2,"text":"because everybody's trying\nto sell at the same time."},"1690":{"dur":4,"text":"And in fact, not only that,\nflooded markets, low prices, but"},"1694":{"dur":4,"text":"45% of the produce they grow in the rainy\nseason rots before it's eaten at all."},"1700":{"dur":2,"text":"Which is a tragedy in a place where\npeople are hungry, because three, four,"},"1702":{"dur":1,"text":"five months later, there's no food."},"1704":{"dur":2,"text":"And they call it the hunger season,\nthe dry season."},"1709":{"dur":5,"text":"With irrigation on the other hand,\nyear-round high prices at the farm gate."},"1714":{"dur":1,"text":"Because you're the only\nperson in the game."},"1715":{"dur":2,"text":"And just to show this a little bit more\nclearly, if this is a typical place in"},"1718":{"dur":2,"text":"Zambia where you have one rainy\nseason on many places in Africa."},"1721":{"dur":1,"text":"You got the months going out across there."},"1723":{"dur":2,"text":"You got the rains shown there."},"1725":{"dur":1,"text":"It's starting to rain."},"1726":{"dur":3,"text":"So you plant your rainfed\ncrops sometime there."},"1729":{"dur":1,"text":"And then we got your rainfed harvest."},"1731":{"dur":2,"text":"Well you start by harvesting\nthe vegetables and"},"1733":{"dur":1,"text":"legumes right after the rains."},"1735":{"dur":1,"text":"You make a bit of money there."},"1736":{"dur":2,"text":"And then you go into a hungry\nseason with no food."},"1739":{"dur":1,"text":"And then you get your maize harvest."},"1741":{"dur":0,"text":"And again you got some money."},"1742":{"dur":2,"text":"You got some food, but there's\na hungry season there, and guess what?"},"1745":{"dur":3,"text":"There's another hungry season\nnow coming up to the next rains."},"1749":{"dur":2,"text":"Right?\nIf you irrigate, you can fill in those"},"1752":{"dur":4,"text":"hungry seasons right there, get the high\nprices growth throughout the year and"},"1756":{"dur":3,"text":"multiple harvest, many buyers,\nhighest prices, no waste."},"1759":{"dur":3,"text":"And nowadays, of course, with climate\nchange, and Africa's getting hit very"},"1763":{"dur":4,"text":"hard with climate change, it's even more\nimportant even to save your rainfed crops."},"1768":{"dur":0,"text":"Irrigation is critical."},"1771":{"dur":4,"text":"So with irrigation, you get two and half\ntimes your yield because you grow multiple"},"1775":{"dur":2,"text":"cycles per year compared to rainfed."},"1777":{"dur":4,"text":"But you get about four times your income,\ncompared to rainfed."},"1781":{"dur":3,"text":"Now if you combine that with\nbetter season fertilizer as well,"},"1784":{"dur":3,"text":"you can actually get ten times the income\ncompared to what you were doing with"},"1788":{"dur":2,"text":"poor season fertilizer or\nno season fertilizer."},"1790":{"dur":4,"text":"Just the normal traditional way\nof farming without irrigation."},"1795":{"dur":4,"text":"So irrigation is hugely profitable,\nlike I say multiple harvests,"},"1800":{"dur":2,"text":"higher prices, higher value."},"1802":{"dur":7,"text":"So 20% of farmland globally is irrigated,\nproducing 40% of our food, okay?"},"1810":{"dur":1,"text":"35% is already irrigated in India."},"1812":{"dur":2,"text":"40% is already irrigated across Asia."},"1815":{"dur":5,"text":"But in Sub-Saharan Africa,\nonly 4% of the farmland is irrigated."},"1820":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is precisely why it's so\nprofitable."},"1823":{"dur":3,"text":"Right?\nBecause nobody else is growing any food."},"1826":{"dur":3,"text":"And of that, 65% of that is in Sudan,\nSouth Africa and"},"1829":{"dur":2,"text":"Madagascar, and 40% of it is large farms."},"1832":{"dur":4,"text":"So the amount done by small\nholders is tiny, right?"},"1836":{"dur":1,"text":"So how do we tackle this problem?"},"1837":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, if a farmer wants to irrigate,\nwhat do they need?"},"1839":{"dur":1,"text":"They need a pump in order to get the food,\nsorry,"},"1841":{"dur":3,"text":"in order to get the water out\nof a well and to the field."},"1845":{"dur":4,"text":"And they have a choice, they can use\na bucket to pull it up and walk and"},"1849":{"dur":4,"text":"do that or they could try to get\na petrol pump, which is a bit expensive."},"1854":{"dur":3,"text":"But very expensive to maintain and\nuse cuz you gotta buy petrol every day."},"1857":{"dur":3,"text":"And in the rural areas, there isn't any\npetrol, you can't store it when you get"},"1860":{"dur":2,"text":"it, and then when it breaks down,\nyou don't have spare parts."},"1863":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is why we designed\nthese human powered pumps."},"1867":{"dur":3,"text":"This is a pump I'll show you in a second,\nwe originally, starting in 1999 called"},"1871":{"dur":4,"text":"the Super MoneyMaker Max,\na little StairMaster machine."},"1875":{"dur":1,"text":"And our brand is MoneyMaker."},"1877":{"dur":3,"text":"Why?\nBecause people cared about making money,"},"1880":{"dur":1,"text":"so that's our brand."},"1882":{"dur":1,"text":"It was either that or sex."},"1883":{"dur":1,"text":">> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So,"},"1885":{"dur":2,"text":"it's efficient hose pipe irrigation,"},"1887":{"dur":5,"text":"where you actually take a hose pipe to the\nfield and put it right onto the plants."},"1893":{"dur":1,"text":"Just like you would with\na garden hose pipe."},"1895":{"dur":2,"text":"So you have very efficient use of water,\nright?"},"1897":{"dur":5,"text":"And it's now more often to this pump here,\nwhich is the MoneyMaker Max,"},"1903":{"dur":3,"text":"little StairMaster machine,\njust walk back and forth like this."},"1906":{"dur":2,"text":"You have a hose pipe here\ngoing down into the well,"},"1908":{"dur":1,"text":"a hose pipe there going\noff into the field."},"1910":{"dur":1,"text":"You can put sprinklers on it,\nbut you don't need it."},"1912":{"dur":3,"text":"It's just to pressurize\nhose pipe irrigation."},"1916":{"dur":4,"text":"So this nice little pump here\ngives you some good exercise, but"},"1920":{"dur":2,"text":"it can irrigate two acres of land."},"1922":{"dur":2,"text":"If you work a couple of hours in the\nmorning, a couple of hours in the evening,"},"1924":{"dur":4,"text":"which is when you wanna irrigate And\nwith the hosepipes, it retails at $160."},"1929":{"dur":4,"text":"That's with all the mark ups and the hose\npipes, and everything for a farmer."},"1934":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's a lot of money,\nbut we sold a lot of those."},"1938":{"dur":3,"text":"But it's a little bit too much money,\nso we said let's design a cheaper pump."},"1942":{"dur":2,"text":"So, we designed this pump here."},"1945":{"dur":2,"text":"So this looks like a bicycle pump."},"1947":{"dur":2,"text":"And sure enough,\nif you get on it here and you do this."},"1950":{"dur":2,"text":"Your arms get tired very, very quickly."},"1953":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe they're already tired."},"1955":{"dur":3,"text":"But if you operate like this, because it's\ngot a pivot, you can do this all day."},"1959":{"dur":4,"text":"So just by simply changing the ergonomics,\nyou can make a pump that operates all day."},"1963":{"dur":2,"text":"Again, it sucks water from as deep,\nboth these pumps,"},"1965":{"dur":2,"text":"from as deep as seven meters deep,\nalmost 30 feet deep."},"1968":{"dur":3,"text":"And then pressurizes another seven or\neight meters vertically."},"1971":{"dur":3,"text":"So you've got 200 meters along\nflat ground, or up a hill."},"1975":{"dur":2,"text":"And so with that rocking motion there,"},"1977":{"dur":4,"text":"this pump retails including the host\npipes so expensive for about $90."},"1984":{"dur":1,"text":"Irrigate about one and a quarter acres."},"1985":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'm just gonna tell you one\nstory about a

150%."},"2512":{"dur":7,"text":"And that's the sort of areas of high\npotential for irrigation on rural poverty."},"2520":{"dur":2,"text":"But for Africa to feed itself,"},"2522":{"dur":6,"text":"we have to get close to the global average\nof 20% of the land irrigated, okay?"},"2528":{"dur":1,"text":"So we need to massively scale."},"2530":{"dur":1,"text":"So I've just been told I have\nvery little time left but"},"2532":{"dur":2,"text":"I might stretch that a little bit."},"2535":{"dur":4,"text":"[LAUGH] So we put together\na new strategic plan to scale."},"2540":{"dur":3,"text":"And we wanna enable another million\npeople to climb out of poverty by 2021."},"2543":{"dur":2,"text":"But to do that,\nwe have to work differently."},"2546":{"dur":2,"text":"What we realized is that\ndoing retail sales,"},"2549":{"dur":3,"text":"our staff getting out there, meeting\nfarmers, convincing them to buy a pump,"},"2552":{"dur":4,"text":"was extremely expensive\nway to sell a pump."},"2557":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's why we could never\nbe anywhere close to profitable."},"2560":{"dur":2,"text":"Why we had to use donor funds\nto do all that education."},"2563":{"dur":2,"text":"Because we're looking for\na huge behavior change."},"2565":{"dur":4,"text":"So instead, we've gone to a leveraged\npartnership model, where we now work with"},"2569":{"dur":4,"text":"organizations that are already working\nwith thousands of farmers on the ground."},"2574":{"dur":5,"text":"We convinced them that they should\nintroduce pumps into their programs,"},"2579":{"dur":1,"text":"to their farmers."},"2580":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's highly leveraged."},"2583":{"dur":4,"text":"And in that way, we spend our effort now\nworking with the partners who then talk to"},"2588":{"dur":4,"text":"the farmers, instead of us spending a lot\nof effort down working with the farmers."},"2592":{"dur":3,"text":"To do this, we had to completely\nswap out our sales team."},"2596":{"dur":3,"text":"Those distributors, by the way,\nwill also sell to retail shops."},"2599":{"dur":5,"text":"And we had to teach a whole new way\nof selling to sales team,

solve their problems by"},"2614":{"dur":4,"text":"having them introduce the right pumps and\nirrigation to their farmers."},"2620":{"dur":3,"text":"We said, let's work in the 16 highest\npotential countries across Africa."},"2624":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're working out of three hubs\nin West Africa, East Africa, and"},"2627":{"dur":2,"text":"Southern Africa with these 16 countries."},"2631":{"dur":3,"text":"And like I said, we partner now\nwith every type of NGO, with"},"2635":{"dur":4,"text":"government organizations, with private\nsector organizations in these

farmers."},"2644":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's very high leverage\nwith a very low marginal cost."},"2647":{"dur":4,"text":"And then at the same time, we need to\nhave a private sector supply chain."},"2651":{"dur":3,"text":"So we work with the biggest importers and\ndistributors in these countries, so"},"2655":{"dur":4,"text":"that the pumps and the spare parts are\nlocally available
