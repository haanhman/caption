out,"},"4009":{"dur":4,"text":"comes from Russia, perhaps in Russia it existed in theory,"},"4014":{"dur":3,"text":"I have never seen it implemented in practice"},"4017":{"dur":2,"text":"in mathematical education."},"4020":{"dur":3,"text":"So has this actually been done in China?"},"4025":{"dur":2,"text":"- Let me separate this in two ways."},"4027":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think it's fair to say that in China,"},"4032":{"dur":2,"text":"during the Cultural Revolution, if you're a mathematician"},"4034":{"dur":2,"text":"and if you wanted to be able to do your mathematics,"},"4037":{"dur":3,"text":"this provided you with a justification"},"4041":{"dur":2,"text":"for doing mathematics and in fact maybe legitimately"},"4043":{"dur":1,"text":"trying to find better foundations,"},"4045":{"dur":1,"text":"better ways to do teaching."},"4047":{"dur":3,"text":"So it offered them that justification."},"4051":{"dur":2,"text":"This is during the Cultural Revolution."},"4053":{"dur":2,"text":"Within two years of the Cultural Revolution's being over,"},"4055":{"dur":2,"text":"however, you've seen what mathematicians"},"4058":{"dur":3,"text":"were

institutes,"},"4066":{"dur":3,"text":"my own institute 10 years after the Cultural Revolution,"},"4070":{"dur":2,"text":"they were still having their indoctrination meetings,"},"4072":{"dur":2,"text":"and they would have to go and sit there,"},"4074":{"dur":1,"text":"and there would be somebody reading,"},"4076":{"dur":2,"text":"and they would all be reading the newspaper,"},"4078":{"dur":1,"text":"but they had to go."},"4080":{"dur":2,"text":"But I don't know that they actually incorporated it"},"4082":{"dur":4,"text":"into what they were doing in text book writing, for example,"},"4086":{"dur":1,"text":"and things like that."},"4088":{"dur":2,"text":"It may be similar to what I remember"},"4091":{"dur":3,"text":"when I was in Berlin in the late 1960s"},"4094":{"dur":2,"text":"and the Berlin Wall was still up."},"4096":{"dur":2,"text":"And I had to live in west Berlin, but I would go"},"4099":{"dur":2,"text":"across the Berlin Wall every day into east Berlin"},"4101":{"dur":2,"text":"because I was working at Akademie der Wissenschaften"},"4103":{"dur":2,"text":"which was (mumbles) in the east"},"4105":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's where the mathematical archive was"},"4108":{"dur":2,"text":"and all the papers I wanted to see of Weierstrass"},"4110":{"dur":1,"text":"and other mathematicians were there."},"4112":{"dur":1,"text":"I would go back and forth."},"4114":{"dur":3,"text":"You would see the works that the historians of mathematics"},"4117":{"dur":3,"text":"working in east Germany would write,"},"4120":{"dur":2,"text":"and they would all begin with a preface,"},"4123":{"dur":1,"text":"they would talk about Marx and Lenin"},"4125":{"dur":1,"text":"and all the things that the dialectic had to do"},"4126":{"dur":2,"text":"with the books that they were writing."},"4129":{"dur":1,"text":"Then you'd read the book and there was no further mention"},"4131":{"dur":1,"text":"of Marx or Lenin."},"4132":{"dur":3,"text":"It was all part of the window dressing"},"4136":{"dur":1,"text":"that made it possible for them to do what they did,"},"4138":{"dur":2,"text":"and if they didn't do that they would never get published."},"4141":{"dur":4,"text":"So my sense is that during the Cultural Revolution,"},"4145":{"dur":2,"text":"of course, people did this because it was a means"},"4148":{"dur":2,"text":"to allow them to do what they really wanted to do."},"4150":{"dur":2,"text":"And if they didn't do it, they couldn't."},"4153":{"dur":4,"text":"And then you have people like Hua Lu-gung or Wu Wenjun,"},"4157":{"dur":2,"text":"prominent mathematicians who did go into factories"},"4160":{"dur":1,"text":"and tried to use operations research"},"4162":{"dur":3,"text":"and tried to find ways to

they really try to teach the workers"},"4174":{"dur":3,"text":"how they could use this mathematics to improve"},"4177":{"dur":1,"text":"what the factories and the workers"},"4179":{"dur":2,"text":"were supposed to be doing."},"4181":{"dur":2,"text":"And it always seem to me that one of the legacies"},"4184":{"dur":2,"text":"of the Cultural Revolution that is often forgotten"},"4186":{"dur":3,"text":"is that it did tend to create in China"},"4190":{"dur":2,"text":"a very different society because the intellectuals"},"4193":{"dur":1,"text":"were sent out to live with the peasants"},"4194":{"dur":3,"text":"and the peasantry learned more about what it was like"},"4198":{"dur":3,"text":"in the cities and it was, I think, a kind

Beijing."},"4250":{"dur":2,"text":"15 years later I'm in Beijing,"},"4253":{"dur":3,"text":"their young son Xin Yi is grown up, 15 years,"},"4256":{"dur":1,"text":"and they say, \"Our son has no

their children were now in the cities doing their things"},"4282":{"dur":3,"text":"but the parents in that generation were still there."},"4285":{"dur":0,"text":"It was just extraordinary."},"4286":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think the Cultural Revolution is sometimes seen"},"4289":{"dur":2,"text":"as an entirely negative experience."},"4292":{"dur":1,"text":"And for many people it was and what the red guards"},"4294":{"dur":3,"text":"did to many people, particularly if they were very educated"},"4297":{"dur":2,"text":"and privileged and maybe had abused at"},"4300":{"dur":2,"text":"suffered tremendously and people have written books"},"4303":{"dur":1,"text":"about that which anyone can read."},"4304":{"dur":2,"text":"But for many people, I think it was"},"4308":{"dur":1,"text":"an extraordinary experience in China"},"4310":{"dur":2,"text":"and the barefoot doctors movement all of those things"},"4312":{"dur":2,"text":"did things in China that
