billion."},"394":{"dur":3,"text":"And the reason for\nthat is, in part,"},"398":{"dur":5,"text":"that Iran has a lot of\nbills that have come due,"},"403":{"dur":4,"text":"and so much of the sanctions\nrelief that they will"},"407":{"dur":5,"text":"receive will immediately be\ndevoted to paying off debts"},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"that they have incurred."},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"The second thing that's\nimportant for people to"},"417":{"dur":3,"text":"understand is that the\nsanctions relief that they"},"420":{"dur":4,"text":"receive will merely allow\nthem to get access to

anything."},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm just suggesting that\nthey're not getting any"},"464":{"dur":3,"text":"financial resources\nfrom the United States."},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"It's their own

precise\ncalculation I'd refer you to"},"478":{"dur":1,"text":"the Treasury Department."},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"And the reason that I wanted\nto go through this exercise"},"481":{"dur":3,"text":"is it's often described by\nour critics as what Iran is"},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"getting, but they fail to\nnote what the international"},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"community is getting and\nwhat the United
