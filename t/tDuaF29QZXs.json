So, as they crossed a high bridge,"},"814":{"dur":3,"text":"between them they managed to throw this package\nof documents into the river and"},"817":{"dur":5,"text":"it was washed away.

So, she thought,"},"864":{"dur":3,"text":"'They've got another motive here: it's not\njust politics, it's money involved.'"},"867":{"dur":4,"text":"So, she was wearing underneath her shirt a\nbeautiful cut-glass necklace that Wladimir"},"872":{"dur":3,"text":"had given her as a love token. And she leant\nforward, as if nervously and distracted,"},"875":{"dur":5,"text":"and started saying, 'Oh, my diamonds, my diamonds!'\nand pulling this necklace about.

And as they did so she broke"},"885":{"dur":4,"text":"the string so the diamonds tumbled into the\nwet grass. And they swung the torch down to"},"890":{"dur":4,"text":"catch where these beads had gone.
