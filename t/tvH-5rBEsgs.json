have said\n\"Welcome to Blue Book,\""},"30":{"dur":3,"text":"but a lot of people here\nhaven't seen it yet."},"34":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's talk a little bit\nabout first, your background."},"37":{"dur":4,"text":"You started mostly as a\nwriter and then producer,"},"41":{"dur":1,"text":"and director of some things."},"43":{"dur":0,"text":"ALEX GARLAND: Yeah."},"44":{"dur":1,"text":"DANA HAN-KLEIN: You're a writer."},"46":{"dur":2,"text":"So what was it about\nthis subject matter"},"48":{"dur":1,"text":"in this film that\nmade you go, this"},"50":{"dur":1,"text":"is the one I want to direct?"},"52":{"dur":1,"text":"ALEX GARLAND: Oh."},"53":{"dur":1,"text":"Nothing."},"55":{"dur":1,"text":"DANA HAN-KLEIN: All right, then."},"56":{"dur":3,"text":"ALEX GARLAND: It was that I\nkeep having this conversation."},"60":{"dur":2,"text":"And I realize why, I guess."},"63":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's because we dignify\nthe role of a director,"},"66":{"dur":1,"text":"and it seems like\na really big deal."},"67":{"dur":3,"text":"I've been working film for\nabout 15 years, a lot of it"},"70":{"dur":1,"text":"with the same group of people."},"72":{"dur":1,"text":"To me, this is just\npart of a continuum."},"74":{"dur":3,"text":"It's just another film with the\nsame group of people, largely."},"77":{"dur":3,"text":"And there was no really\nsignificant difference"},"80":{"dur":1,"text":"between this, and\nthe one before,"},"82":{"dur":0,"text":"and the one before that."},"83":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's because the\nquestion stems from the fact"},"86":{"dur":1,"text":"that we overstate the\nrole of the director."},"88":{"dur":1,"text":"That's what I would say."},"90":{"dur":1,"text":"DANA HAN-KLEIN: But at\nthe same time, I think,"},"91":{"dur":1,"text":"depending on the relationship\nyou have with someone"},"93":{"dur":2,"text":"who's directing\nyour own material,"},"95":{"dur":1,"text":"you have a lot of\ntrust in them to--"},"97":{"dur":1,"text":"DANA HAN-KLEIN: --be\ntrue to whatever"},"98":{"dur":1,"text":"your original intention was."},"100":{"dur":3,"text":"And that applies the editor\nand the actors, as well."},"103":{"dur":2,"text":"But by being both the\nwriter and director,"},"105":{"dur":3,"text":"you do have an extra\nlevel of control."},"109":{"dur":2,"text":"ALEX GARLAND: But now, you've\nshifted the presupposing"},"111":{"dur":1,"text":"onto the other\ndirectors, and assuming I"},"113":{"dur":2,"text":"gave them that level of\ncontrol, if you see what I mean."},"115":{"dur":4,"text":"And really, what it is,\nthe key thing you said"},"120":{"dur":7,"text":"is that the editor, the DOP,\nthe actors, film is broadly"},"127":{"dur":1,"text":"a collaborative process."},"128":{"dur":3,"text":"Having come from books, which\nis not a collaborative process,"},"131":{"dur":2,"text":"for the most part,\nI can state film"},"134":{"dur":1,"text":"is, I think it would\nbe fair to say."},"135":{"dur":4,"text":"And all the people in that film\nhave a real and significant"},"140":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's not just paying\nlip service to it."},"142":{"dur":1,"text":"They really, really do."},"143":{"dur":2,"text":"That's why production\ncompanies fight like crazy"},"146":{"dur":2,"text":"over who the DOP is or the\nproduction designer is."},"148":{"dur":3,"text":"If it was just observing\nthe vision of the director,"},"152":{"dur":2,"text":"what difference?"},"154":{"dur":2,"text":"DANA HAN-KLEIN: Fair

things"},"174":{"dur":1,"text":"that you drew from?"},"175":{"dur":3,"text":"ALEX GARLAND: Well,\nalthough it may not"},"178":{"dur":3,"text":"look like it from the\nstories and zombie movies"},"181":{"dur":2,"text":"and stuff I've\nworked on previously,"},"183":{"dur":2,"text":"I try to draw as much from\nreal-life observation as"},"186":{"dur":1,"text":"possible."},"187":{"dur":3,"text":"I had got involved with\na long-running argument--"},"191":{"dur":2,"text":"a good-natured argument,\nbut still an argument--"},"193":{"dur":1,"text":"with a neuroscientist\nfriend of mine"},"194":{"dur":3,"text":"who comes from that very\nrespectable position that"},"198":{"dur":3,"text":"exists within the

something particular\nabout human consciousness"},"209":{"dur":1,"text":"that hasn't been understood yet."},"210":{"dur":1,"text":"When we do understand\nit, we will"},"212":{"dur":4,"text":"see why machines are precluded\nfrom ever being sentient."},"216":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think on an instinctive\nlevel, I disagreed with him."},"220":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, we argued over years."},"222":{"dur":3,"text":"And mainly, this film\ncomes out of that argument."},"226":{"dur":2,"text":"I finally came\nacross a book written"},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"by the professor of\ncognitive robotics"},"230":{"dur":2,"text":"at Imperial, which is\nlike our version of MIT."},"233":{"dur":1,"text":"And it was about\nthe relationship"},"235":{"dur":1,"text":"between consciousness\nand embodiment."},"236":{"dur":3,"text":"And he has a really beautiful,\nelegant argument in it"},"239":{"dur":2,"text":"which combats, I think\nquite

me to read that book."},"250":{"dur":1,"text":"I could only read\nsections of it."},"251":{"dur":1,"text":"It's like mountain\nclimbing for me."},"253":{"dur":4,"text":"But while I was reading that\nbook, the idea for this film"},"257":{"dur":1,"text":"arrived."},"258":{"dur":1,"text":"DANA HAN-KLEIN: So\nyou definitely delve"},"260":{"dur":5,"text":"into some of the headier\nissues of what is humanity?"},"265":{"dur":0,"text":"What is personality?"},"266":{"dur":4,"text":"What is a sentient creature?"},"270":{"dur":4,"text":"And so what were some of\nthe challenges of getting"},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"this heady topic material,\nsubject matter-- and it"},"277":{"dur":2,"text":"has a lot of scientific\nimplications--"},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"to translate to a\ncinematic story,"},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"as well as something that\nis also a human story,"},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"and not getting too bogged\ndown in the science,"},"288":{"dur":1,"text":"but still conveying--\nit was a challenge."},"289":{"dur":3,"text":"You picked a big challenge\nfor your subject matter."},"296":{"dur":1,"text":"ALEX GARLAND: Yeah."},"298":{"dur":0,"text":"It was."},"299":{"dur":1,"text":"I guess there was a\nchallenge involved."},"301":{"dur":1,"text":"I was just trying\nto be, I was trying"},"303":{"dur":1,"text":"to be fair to the\nsubject matter,"},"305":{"dur":1,"text":"I guess, and tried to\nbe respectful about it,"},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"and tried really\ntry to understand it"},"309":{"dur":2,"text":"within my own limitations\nas best as I could"},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"before writing it."},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"Partly, because I\nthink it's interesting."},"315":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's an area\nwhere-- though this"},"319":{"dur":1,"text":"is true of lots\nof area of science"},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"at the moment, where\nthere's a kind of increasing"},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"vacuum between the people who\nare actually doing this stuff"},"326":{"dur":2,"text":"and the rest of us who are\ntrying to understand it."},"328":{"dur":2,"text":"So some of it's about trying to\nbridge that vacuum as best as"},"331":{"dur":0,"text":"possible."},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"But it's really\ntough to do that."},"335":{"dur":4,"text":"The things about it is, is\nthat any look at strong

will necessarily be\nlike us in many ways."},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"It may be completely different\nfrom us in almost all ways."},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"But the issues and\nthe conversations"},"360":{"dur":3,"text":"in this current state of not\nunderstanding are very related."},"367":{"dur":3,"text":"DANA HAN-KLEIN: Let's talk\nabout the more human factors."},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"You had a really wonderful cast."},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"I thought that Alicia?"},"376":{"dur":1,"text":"ALEX GARLAND: Alicia, yes."},"377":{"dur":3,"text":"DANA HAN-KLEIN: She brought\njust this really great quality"},"380":{"dur":4,"text":"of inhuman but human to\nthe character of Ava."},"385":{"dur":4,"text":"And I'm sure that's exactly what\nyou wanted her to bring to it."},"390":{"dur":1,"text":"Were there things\nthat you worked on"},"391":{"dur":6,"text":"to get her to telegraph\nthat human but not?"},"398":{"dur":3,"text":"ALEX GARLAND: She\narrived with it."},"402":{"dur":1,"text":"I'd seen her in other movies."},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"And we had various\nconversations and stuff."},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"But when she arrived,\nshe had this idea."},"407":{"dur":1,"text":"She's a ballerina by training."},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"So she has a terrific\ncontrol over her physicality,"},"412":{"dur":1,"text":"as well as being a\nvery, very good actor."},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"She was very graceful."},"414":{"dur":1,"text":"ALEX GARLAND: She's\nvery graceful."},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"DANA HAN-KLEIN: Almost\nunsettling in a character way."},"418":{"dur":1,"text":"ALEX GARLAND: Well, exactly."},"420":{"dur":1,"text":"So do you know the VFX?"},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"You know the VFX, because\nyou used to work in VFX."},"423":{"dur":0,"text":"DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yes."},"424":{"dur":0,"text":"DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yes."},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"ALEX GARLAND: So what she did\nwas a kind of uncanny valley"},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"version of human motion."},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"She said, I'm not going\nto act like a robot."},"432":{"dur":1,"text":"What I'm going to\ndo is human actions,"},"434":{"dur":1,"text":"but I'm going to\ndo them perfectly."},"436":{"dur":3,"text":"And that perfection will\ncreate a sense of otherness."},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"Because when I'm sat on\nthis chair-- actually,"},"441":{"dur":1,"text":"you're sort of graceful."},"443":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not."},"444":{"dur":0,"text":"And I slouch."},"445":{"dur":3,"text":"And if I get up, I\nhave to shove myself"},"448":{"dur":3,"text":"up and combat my middle age\nand all that kind of stuff."},"451":{"dur":4,"text":"So whereas she does it with\nthis amazing dancer's poise."},"456":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's hard to\nlook at it and say"},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"anything she does is sort\nof, quote unquote, wrong."},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"But together, it creates\nthis uncanny valley,"},"463":{"dur":1,"text":"slightly unnatural quality."},"464":{"dur":0,"text":"DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yes."},"465":{"dur":3,"text":"So you brought up\nthe uncanny valley."},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"I was almost afraid,\nseeing the trailers."},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"All the footage was beautiful."},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"I was like, OK, I don't think\nthey're going to hit it."},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"And you didn't fall into\nthat, which was amazing."},"476":{"dur":3,"text":"But it's a challenge,\nespecially considering"},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"the anatomy of\nthe main character"},"481":{"dur":1,"text":"for the majority of the film."},"483":{"dur":4,"text":"We see her in this\nrobotic hybrid synthetic,"},"488":{"dur":1,"text":"with a human face."},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's a little unsettling."},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"At times, she's just\nso perfect-looking."},"494":{"dur":3,"text":"But you managed to still\ncapture a human-ish element,"},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"so it didn't hit the too\ncartoonish and too humanoid."},"503":{"dur":0,"text":"Yeah."},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"Congratulations on that."},"506":{"dur":1,"text":"ALEX GARLAND: Thanks, sort of."},"508":{"dur":3,"text":"The funny thing\nis about people is"},"511":{"dur":6,"text":"that our urge is to project\nhumanlike qualities into almost"},"517":{"dur":1,"text":"everything."},"519":{"dur":3,"text":"It's almost an effort\nto stop it happening."},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"There is this incredibly\nbeautiful VFX,"},"524":{"dur":1,"text":"and there's beautiful\nproduction design,"},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's beautifully shot,\nand it's beautifully lit,"},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"and all those kinds of things."},"530":{"dur":6,"text":"But that thing of making this\nstrange machine, believing that"},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"has the qualities\nthat we have, that's"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"actually really quite easy."},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"That is to say, you can\ntake it with a child."},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"It's probably quite\nhard to find children"},"545":{"dur":3,"text":"who don't attribute sentience\nto their cuddly toys,"},"549":{"dur":1,"text":"right, in some ways?"},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's where,\nI guess, it begins."},"552":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, in fact, it\nprobably begins"},"554":{"dur":3,"text":"because it's semi coded\ninto us in some respects."},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"I was driving not that\nlong ago with an adult who"},"561":{"dur":4,"text":"was feeling pissed off with\ntheir car and critical of it,"},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"but didn't want to say\nso in front of the car,"},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"in case it hurt the\ncar's feelings, right?"},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, that's a grown-up."},"572":{"dur":7,"text":"And cars don't look much\nlike us, more or less."},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"So yeah."},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"I know you're being\nkind about the film."},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm not trying\nto be combative."},"587":{"dur":1,"text":"DANA HAN-KLEIN: It's your film."},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"ALEX GARLAND: It's a collective."},"591":{"dur":1,"text":"DANA HAN-KLEIN:\nI think there are"},"592":{"dur":4,"text":"a lot of times when we see these\nrepresentations of humanity"},"597":{"dur":4,"text":"but not humanity, and you\nreally want to project onto it."},"601":{"dur":5,"text":"And what you had to do is\ncombat that a little bit."},"607":{"dur":4,"text":"A lot of the plot of it\nhinges on us accepting"},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"this artificial element to it."},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"ALEX GARLAND: True, true."},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"So initially what you do is, in\na very up-front way, you say,"},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"this is a machine."},"620":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's no ambiguity."},"621":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a machine."},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's all sorts of things\nto force you to think that way."},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"There's cavities where\nthere shouldn't be cavities."},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"And you can see\nthrough her in a way"},"629":{"dur":6,"text":"that removes her being like\nus, a girl in a suit, say."},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"And then, the task of\nthe film is to gradually"},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"have that machine\nquality fall away,"},"641":{"dur":3,"text":"even though she looks the same."},"645":{"dur":4,"text":"And to show just by behavior,\nwe will forget the thing"},"649":{"dur":3,"text":"that's right in front of us."},"653":{"dur":3,"text":"DANA HAN-KLEIN: So the VFX team\nbehind this did an amazing job."},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"It was fantastic."},"657":{"dur":1,"text":"And a shout-out to them."},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"Can you talk about working\nwith them, especially having,"},"661":{"dur":1,"text":"basically, one of your\nprotagonist characters"},"663":{"dur":3,"text":"be mostly CG for a good\nportion of the movie?"},"666":{"dur":1,"text":"ALEX GARLAND: Yeah."},"668":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, they were run, it's\na company DNeg, or Double"},"671":{"dur":3,"text":"Negative, which are based in\nLondon, where I live and work."},"675":{"dur":3,"text":"And our team was run by a\nguy called Andrew Whitehurst."},"678":{"dur":3,"text":"And in the course of my\nlife, every now and then,"},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"I've met some really,\nreally smart people."},"684":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think he may be the\nsmartest guy I've ever met."},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"He may or may not."},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"But he's certainly going\nto be in the top tier."},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"The thing about him\nthat's so interesting"},"693":{"dur":4,"text":"is he's got a real gift for\npoetry, in a way, the beauty,"},"698":{"dur":0,"text":"and things like that."},"699":{"dur":1,"text":"So I remember one\nday he said, look,"},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"I've got this great\nidea, which is"},"702":{"dur":4,"text":"to hang plastic strips inside\nher form which will diffuse"},"707":{"dur":1,"text":"the light in a\nparticular kind of way,"},"709":{"dur":1,"text":"and make her slightly\nmore mysterious,"},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"even though you can\nsee the machinery."},"712":{"dur":3,"text":"And so that's a\nlovely poetic idea."},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"And then another day, we ran\ninto this massive quality"},"719":{"dur":0,"text":"control issue."},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"It's kind of\ntechnical, and I will"},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"fail to explain it properly."},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"But basically, we were\ngetting, because of the way"},"725":{"dur":3,"text":"the images on the Sony cameras\nwe'd use were being processed,"},"729":{"dur":1,"text":"or something-- I don't\nknow-- we were getting"},"730":{"dur":1,"text":"these weird stray pixels."},"732":{"dur":3,"text":"And in big flat areas of\ncolor, suddenly there'd"},"736":{"dur":1,"text":"be these stray pixels."},"737":{"dur":1,"text":"And we had a problem,\nbecause we were"},"738":{"dur":2,"text":"going to fail a quality control\nthing to do the distributor"},"741":{"dur":1,"text":"when we handed the film over."},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"And he said, don't\nworry, I'll fix that."},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"He wrote some piece of\ncode over, like, a week."},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"And it reprocessed\nall of the imagery."},"750":{"dur":1,"text":"And it fixed it and\nmade it go away."},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm thinking, I don't\nknow how to talk to this guy"},"754":{"dur":1,"text":"He's just got a\nrange of abilities."},"756":{"dur":1,"text":"It's just unreal."},"757":{"dur":1,"text":"DANA HAN-KLEIN:\nThat's impressive."},"759":{"dur":1,"text":"ALEX GARLAND: Yes, it is."},"762":{"dur":1,"text":"DANA HAN-KLEIN: What\nsort of mixture of it"},"764":{"dur":3,"text":"was working with that team,\nand working with the actors,"},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"in terms of integrating\nthis character?"},"769":{"dur":2,"text":"Because if it had gone\nwrong, we would've"},"772":{"dur":1,"text":"been lost as an audience."},"773":{"dur":1,"text":"You would have been\nsnapped out of it."},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"And it would have, probably,\nhit that weird uncanny valley--"},"777":{"dur":0,"text":"ALEX GARLAND: In the wrong way."},"778":{"dur":0,"text":"Yes."},"781":{"dur":0,"text":"ALEX GARLAND: Yeah."},"782":{"dur":5,"text":"My approach to filmmaking-- and\nmy approach very much played"},"787":{"dur":3,"text":"out in this film--\nis about-- this"},"791":{"dur":2,"text":"is going to sound like\ncorporate speak, all right?"},"793":{"dur":3,"text":"But it's about these\ndifferent departments"},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"having a lot of communication\nbetween each other,"},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"and also a lot of autonomy."},"802":{"dur":1,"text":"And that would\ninclude the actors."},"803":{"dur":2,"text":"And it would include the\nVFX team, and the composers,"},"806":{"dur":0,"text":"and so on."},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's not separate group."},"810":{"dur":3,"text":"It's roughly like\nwhat you'd imagine"},"813":{"dur":3,"text":"anarchy would be like ideally,\nwhere you have autonomous"},"817":{"dur":6,"text":"groups, not chucking bricks, but\nagreeing about a common goal."},"823":{"dur":3,"text":"I think that's the key, is\nagreeing about a common goal."},"826":{"dur":1,"text":"And then, having a\nlot of independence"},"828":{"dur":1,"text":"and autonomy within it."},"829":{"dur":4,"text":"And any department\nyou could mention,"},"834":{"dur":1,"text":"that would've been the approach."},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"DANA HAN-KLEIN: Well, speaking\nof capturing the subject"},"838":{"dur":4,"text":"matter, that, and working with\ntechnically challenging things,"},"842":{"dur":4,"text":"a lot of your subject\nmatter is this futuristic,"},"847":{"dur":2,"text":"I want to say a little bit\napocalyptic, in terms of, like,"},"849":{"dur":3,"text":"\"28

challenge of\nit ever influenced you?"},"870":{"dur":2,"text":"Have you ever thought, oh,\nmaybe, I want to do this?"},"872":{"dur":1,"text":"Or you just go with\nthe creative process,"},"874":{"dur":2,"text":"and trust your teams\nto make it work?"},"877":{"dur":2,"text":"ALEX GARLAND: Well,\nyou've got to aim high."},"879":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think one of the things\nis that broadly speaking,"},"883":{"dur":1,"text":"if people feel like\nthey're aiming high,"},"885":{"dur":1,"text":"and they're having\nto work slightly"},"886":{"dur":2,"text":"outside of their comfort\nzone, they raise their game."},"889":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's just what happens."},"891":{"dur":5,"text":"And the key is the\nvibe, in a way."},"897":{"dur":3,"text":"It's like the
