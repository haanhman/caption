using\ntechnology to change the world."},"266":{"dur":2,"text":"And I just want to be like him."},"268":{"dur":3,"text":"And that night I wrote a letter\nto my family and telling

this\nidea of dominating the world"},"281":{"dur":1,"text":"and buying everyone."},"283":{"dur":1,"text":"And then I didn't make this up."},"285":{"dur":1,"text":"I did write that letter."},"286":{"dur":0,"text":"And here's that letter."},"289":{"dur":2,"text":"The first line says, no, I'm not\ngoing to go through this line"},"292":{"dur":1,"text":"But I did highlight\nsome key words"},"294":{"dur":2,"text":"so you know what\nI'm talking about."},"296":{"dur":5,"text":"In that letter, I also wrote I\nwill come to the United States"},"301":{"dur":3,"text":"someday to fulfill

hanging on helicopters\nand saving the world."},"329":{"dur":1,"text":"And I am like that's America."},"331":{"dur":1,"text":"That's where I want to be."},"332":{"dur":5,"text":"So I came when I was 16 under\na cultural exchange program"},"338":{"dur":1,"text":"as a cultural exchange student."},"340":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I thought that's\nthe start of my dream--"},"342":{"dur":1,"text":"my entrepreneur dream."},"344":{"dur":3,"text":"And then fast forward\nanother 14 years."},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"I was 30."},"350":{"dur":3,"text":"And I did not build the\nbiggest company in the world."},"354":{"dur":1,"text":"I didn't even start."},"355":{"dur":4,"text":"And even at work, I\nfeel very stagnant."},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"I just felt-- I\nmean, from outside"},"362":{"dur":1,"text":"I was doing pretty fine."},"363":{"dur":3,"text":"I was working in one of the\nbiggest companies in the world."},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was collecting\ngood income."},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"A lot of people were\nasking me for jobs."},"371":{"dur":4,"text":"But then I-- but I still didn't\ndo the things I wanted to do."},"376":{"dur":2,"text":"I didn't go after my dreams."},"378":{"dur":4,"text":"Even at work, every time I\nfeel like I have a new idea--"},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"every time I want to make\na new proposal-- every time"},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"I want to speak in a\ngroup-- every time I want"},"388":{"dur":2,"text":"to step up and do\nsomething, I just"},"390":{"dur":4,"text":"felt there was this constant\nbattle between the six-year-old"},"395":{"dur":1,"text":"and the 14-year-old."},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"One wanted to change the world."},"398":{"dur":1,"text":"Another was afraid of rejection."},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"And every time that\nsix-year-old won out."},"407":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I just feel maybe\nI missed the boat-- maybe"},"411":{"dur":1,"text":"I got too old."},"413":{"dur":4,"text":"And so I started my-- this\nfear of rejection even extended"},"417":{"dur":2,"text":"after I started my own company."},"419":{"dur":1,"text":"I started my own\ncompany when I was 30."},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"If you're going\nto be Bill Gates,"},"422":{"dur":1,"text":"you got to start\nsooner or later, right?"},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"So I started my company."},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"And four months\ninto my venture, I"},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"was rejected with\nthe investment."},"431":{"dur":1,"text":"And I was hurt."},"433":{"dur":5,"text":"I was hurt so bad that I\nwanted to quit right there."},"438":{"dur":3,"text":"I was just having-- I just\nthought this six-year-old was"},"441":{"dur":1,"text":"whispering in my ear again."},"442":{"dur":1,"text":"Who do you think you are?"},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"Start ups are for the\ngeniuses like Bill Gates"},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"and Steve Jobs or Larry Page."},"449":{"dur":1,"text":"You are just a wanna be."},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"And your friends are\ngoing to laugh at you."},"453":{"dur":4,"text":"And your in-laws are going to\nhate you probably even more."},"458":{"dur":5,"text":"So you should quit and\nstop embarrassing yourself."},"464":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's where\nit clicked for me."},"468":{"dur":3,"text":"And I thought would\nBill

rejection?"},"480":{"dur":3,"text":"Would anyone successful in\ntheir career give up like that?"},"483":{"dur":1,"text":"No way."},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"So I have to really put\nthis six year old back"},"488":{"dur":3,"text":"to his place once and for all."},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"I cannot let him\ndictate my life anymore."},"493":{"dur":5,"text":"So I found how can I do this?"},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"How can overcome this\nfear of rejection"},"500":{"dur":1,"text":"that's been bothering\nme my whole life?"},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"So I searched online."},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"Google was my friend."},"507":{"dur":3,"text":"I just googled how do I\novercome the fear of rejection."},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"And then I came\nup-- first of all,"},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"I came up with a bunch\nof psychology articles"},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"about where the pain and\nfears are coming from."},"517":{"dur":1,"text":"That didn't say anything to me."},"518":{"dur":4,"text":"Then I ran through a bunch of\ninspirational ra ra articles"},"522":{"dur":4,"text":"that talks about, hey, don't\ntake rejection personally."},"527":{"dur":0,"text":"Just overcome it."},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'm like who doesn't\nknow that already?"},"531":{"dur":4,"text":"If it's that simple, why\nwas that hurt this bad."},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I came to a website."},"538":{"dur":3,"text":"It's called\nrejectiontherapy.com."},"541":{"dur":3,"text":"How many of you have heard of\nrejection therapy, by the way?"},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"No one."},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"Someone has to."},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"OK, I'll explain this to you."},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"Rejection therapy is a game."},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a card game."},"553":{"dur":4,"text":"It was started by this\nCanadian guy-- an entrepreneur."},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"His name is Jason Comely."},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, basically,\nit's a game that"},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"is a flash card\ngame that asks you"},"562":{"dur":4,"text":"to look for rejection every day\ninstead of avoiding rejection."},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"So they give you a\n30-day challenge."},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"So every day it asks you to\nget rejected at something--"},"571":{"dur":4,"text":"maybe just ask strange stuff."},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"But in 30 days,\nyou get rejected."},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"But after 30 days, you\nbecame like a badass"},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"because you desensitize yourself\nfrom the pain of rejection."},"584":{"dur":1,"text":"And I just loved this idea."},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"I thought I'm going to do this."},"587":{"dur":5,"text":"I'm going to do this not only\nfor-- not just for 30 days."},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'll do this for 100 days."},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'll come up with my\nown rejection attempt."},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm not going to listen to\nwhat a flash card tells me"},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"because I have a little\nbit of an authority issue."},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I'm just\nusing my imagination"},"604":{"dur":1,"text":"to come up with my\nown rejection attempt."},"606":{"dur":1,"text":"And I will do this for 100 days."},"607":{"dur":1,"text":"And I will use my\nphone to film it."},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'll put it on YouTube\nto make a video blog or vlog."},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"And also, I will tell\nthe world about it"},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"so they will hold\nme accountable."},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"Otherwise, I would probably\njust quit pretty quickly."},"619":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is what I did."},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"This is what the\nwebsite looked then."},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe you can see\nrejection one--"},"626":{"dur":1,"text":"borrow $100 from a stranger."},"630":{"dur":1,"text":"I was working in\nthis big building"},"632":{"dur":1,"text":"in Austin Texas at the time."},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"And I just one day\nI finished work."},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"I came down I saw this big\nguy sitting behind a desk."},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"He looked like a security guard."},"642":{"dur":4,"text":"So I just approached him and\nas I was a walking toward him,"},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"I could just feel the hair\nat the back of my neck"},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"was standing up."},"651":{"dur":1,"text":"I was sweating."},"652":{"dur":1,"text":"My heart was pounding."},"653":{"dur":4,"text":"And as he came, I said, hey,\ncan I borrow $100 from you?"},"658":{"dur":4,"text":"And he looked up me\nand was like, no, why?"},"662":{"dur":3,"text":"And I just turned around\nand just said, I'm sorry."},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"I just ran as fast as I could."},"668":{"dur":1,"text":"I just felt so embarrassed."},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"And that night--\nbut you got to--"},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"because I was doing the\nvideo because I filmed myself"},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"with my phone, I had to\nexperience this twice."},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"So that night I\nwas seeing myself."},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"I had to upload the\nvideo on YouTube, right?"},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"And I just saw myself\nframe by frame."},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"I just saw how scared I was."},"687":{"dur":3,"text":"I looked like this kid from\nthe movie \"Sixth Sense.\""},"690":{"dur":3,"text":"I saw dead people."},"693":{"dur":1,"text":"And then I saw this guy."},"695":{"dur":3,"text":"He was a chubby looking guy."},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"But he was pretty lovable."},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"He wasn't menacing."},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"And he didn't pull out a club."},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"He didn't use pepper\nspray or call the police."},"707":{"dur":1,"text":"He was just saying no."},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"And he asked me why."},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact, he was inviting\nme to explain myself."},"714":{"dur":1,"text":"I could have said many things."},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"I could have said,\nwell, I'm trying"},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"to overcome my\nfear of rejection."},"719":{"dur":1,"text":"That's why I'm\ntrying to do this."},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"Or I could have\nsaid, OK, I'm just"},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"trying to try something new\nto see if it's possible."},"726":{"dur":4,"text":"If you give me $100 and trust\nme, I'll give you $110 back."},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"That's 10% rate of return."},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"You're not going to get that\nin the stock market in one day."},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"And I worked upstairs."},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"If you don't trust me,\nhere's my driver's license."},"738":{"dur":1,"text":"I could have negotiated."},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"I could say if\nyou can't do $100,"},"741":{"dur":3,"text":"I can do $50--\nsomething like that."},"745":{"dur":1,"text":"But I didn't do any of that."},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"I just ran as fast as I could."},"749":{"dur":5,"text":"And I'm like, wow, this\nis a microcosm of my life."},"754":{"dur":1,"text":"Every time I get\nrejected at something,"},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"I would just run because\nit was so painful for me."},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"So I said the next day,\nno matter what happens,"},"762":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not going to run."},"764":{"dur":0,"text":"I'll stay engaged."},"765":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'll chat."},"766":{"dur":4,"text":"So rejection two--\nrequest a burger refill."},"773":{"dur":1,"text":"Of course, I didn't\nwork at Google."},"774":{"dur":1,"text":"So you can pull this off here."},"776":{"dur":1,"text":"You get free burgers\nif you are here."},"777":{"dur":3,"text":"But I went to a burger joint."},"781":{"dur":4,"text":"And after having a very\njuicy burger for lunch,"},"785":{"dur":3,"text":"I went to the cashier and said,\nhey, can I get a burger refill?"},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"I was like what's\na burger refill?"},"791":{"dur":3,"text":"Just like a drink refill,\nbut with a burger."},"794":{"dur":3,"text":"And he was like, sorry, we\ndon't do burger refills, man."},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"And so this is where\nthe rejection happened."},"800":{"dur":3,"text":"And I could have just ran\nright there like I did before."},"803":{"dur":1,"text":"But this time I stayed."},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"I said, well, I love you burger."},"807":{"dur":1,"text":"It's so good."},"808":{"dur":3,"text":"If you guys do burger refills,\nI'll love you guys even more."},"811":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'll come back\nhere every day."},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was like, oh, thank\nyou for the compliment."},"815":{"dur":1,"text":"But sorry, we can't\ndo a burger refill."},"816":{"dur":0,"text":"I'll tell my managers."},"817":{"dur":1,"text":"And maybe we'll do it someday."},"819":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't think they ever did\nburger refills because I think"},"822":{"dur":3,"text":"that restaurant is still there."},"826":{"dur":4,"text":"But when I left that day, that\nlife and death feeling-- it"},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"was still awkward."},"832":{"dur":1,"text":"It was still weird."},"833":{"dur":0,"text":"I was still nervous."},"834":{"dur":1,"text":"I was still nervous."},"835":{"dur":3,"text":"But that life and death\nfeeling was not there anymore."},"839":{"dur":1,"text":"So I thought, wow, great!"},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, two days in, I'm\nalready learning stuff."},"842":{"dur":3,"text":"If I just don't run,\nthings can happen."},"846":{"dur":4,"text":"And I just-- I don't have to\nfeel the fear if I just stay"},"850":{"dur":1,"text":"engaged."},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"Then something happened--\nlike something strange--"},"855":{"dur":1,"text":"really strange happened."},"857":{"dur":2,"text":"People started to say yes to me."},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"And more than once."},"861":{"dur":3,"text":"So, for example, let me\nsee-- rejection six-- play"},"865":{"dur":1,"text":"soccer in someone's backyard."},"867":{"dur":1,"text":"All right, so one day\nI held a soccer ball"},"868":{"dur":3,"text":"and knocked on a stranger's\ndoor with my cleats"},"872":{"dur":2,"text":"and shin guards all

come on in."},"895":{"dur":1,"text":"I was just confused as ever."},"897":{"dur":3,"text":"So I went into his backyard\nand just bounced the ball"},"900":{"dur":2,"text":"with my foot and had him\ntake a picture of me."},"903":{"dur":2,"text":"So before leaving I said,\nhow can you say yes?"},"906":{"dur":5,"text":"And he said, this is so off\nthe wall, how can I say no?"},"911":{"dur":6,"text":"OK, then one day I--\none day I was driving."},"918":{"dur":1,"text":"I saw a police car."},"919":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was-- I flagged him down."},"921":{"dur":4,"text":"I pulled the police\nofficer over for revenge."},"926":{"dur":2,"text":"And I said, officer,\ncan I drive your car."},"929":{"dur":2,"text":"And he was-- I'm not\ngoing to drive it away"},"931":{"dur":2,"text":"because if I do that, I'll\nprobably get in trouble."},"934":{"dur":3,"text":"But can I just sit there\nand listen to your radio"},"937":{"dur":2,"text":"and

why?"},"2184":{"dur":2,"text":"When people say no\nto you, ask why?"},"2186":{"dur":0,"text":"Always."},"2187":{"dur":3,"text":"So one day I went into-- I went\nto knock on a stranger's

doors."},"2197":{"dur":1,"text":"That was fun."},"2198":{"dur":3,"text":"But I said can I plant this\nflower in your backyard?"},"2201":{"dur":3,"text":"And he was like, plant\nflower map backyard sorry"},"2205":{"dur":3,"text":"could you do that but\nbefore he could turn away"},"2208":{"dur":3,"text":"I said why just\nlike an mean issues"},"2212":{"dur":2,"text":"this older gentleman\nwas like, well,"},"2214":{"dur":3,"text":"I have a dog that would dig up\nanything I put in the backyard."},"2217":{"dur":1,"text":"And if you want to\ndo this, I don't"},"2219":{"dur":1,"text":"want to destroy your flower."},"2220":{"dur":1,"text":"If you want to do this,\ngo across the street"},"2222":{"dur":0,"text":"and talk to Connie."},"2223":{"dur":1,"text":"Connie loves

me."},"2230":{"dur":1,"text":"And I was like, this\nis flower is awesome."},"2232":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah, let's do it!"},"2233":{"dur":3,"text":"So half an hour later, there was\na flower in Connie's backyard."},"2237":{"dur":4,"text":"And but the thing is had I left\nafter the initial rejection,"},"2241":{"dur":2,"text":"I would have thought, OK,\nof course she would say no"},"2244":{"dur":1,"text":"because this was really weird."},"2246":{"dur":2,"text":"He probably didn't trust me."},"2248":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, I probably wasn't\ngood looking enough or whatever."},"2252":{"dur":1,"text":"But it turned out\nto be none of that."},"2254":{"dur":2,"text":"It's what I offered\ndid not fit his needs."},"2257":{"dur":4,"text":"He trusted me enough to give me\na referral, using a sales term,"},"2261":{"dur":2,"text":"and I converted that referral."},"2264":{"dur":4,"text":"So and then I also learned\nthat you can actually"},"2268":{"dur":5,"text":"say no to people in a nice\nway that makes them your fan."},"2274":{"dur":3,"text":"I found out that\nit's tougher for me"},"2277":{"dur":2,"text":"to say no than get rejected."},"2280":{"dur":1,"text":"It's tougher for\nme to reject people"},"2281":{"dur":1,"text":"than getting rejected\nbecause there's"},"2283":{"dur":1,"text":"a flip side of rejection, right?"},"2284":{"dur":3,"text":"If you say no to people, you\nare afraid to feel like a jerk."},"2288":{"dur":2,"text":"You're afraid to be\nrejected by them in turn."},"2291":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's the same type\nof fear, but just a"},"2293":{"dur":1,"text":"of flip side of the coin."},"2294":{"dur":2,"text":"And so but I learned\nthat sometimes you"},"2297":{"dur":2,"text":"can say the right thing and\ngive them the right rejection."},"2300":{"dur":2,"text":"And they can feel pretty good."},"2302":{"dur":2,"text":"So I went through-- tons of--\nwent though tons of rejections."},"2305":{"dur":3,"text":"Some of the rejections were bad,\nmeaning will people be mean."},"2309":{"dur":2,"text":"But there were some rejections\nthat were really good."},"2312":{"dur":1,"text":"I would just walk\nout a huge fan."},"2313":{"dur":2,"text":"So one thing I\nlearned is you can"},"2316":{"dur":2,"text":"act-- when you reject\npeople, show them"},"2318":{"dur":2,"text":"an alternative to get a yes."},"2321":{"dur":2,"text":"So you are showing that\nyou're not just rejecting them"},"2323":{"dur":2,"text":"as a person, but you are\nrejecting their request"},"2325":{"dur":0,"text":"for a reason."},"2326":{"dur":1,"text":"And you're helping them."},"2327":{"dur":3,"text":"And so one day I went to\na Costco-- love Costco,"},"2331":{"dur":1,"text":"I went to a Costco and\ntalked to the manager."},"2333":{"dur":2,"text":"I said, hey, can I speak\nover your intercom?"},"2335":{"dur":1,"text":"I just want to say\nhi to the customers."},"2337":{"dur":2,"text":"And he said, sorry,\ncan't let you do that."},"2340":{"dur":2,"text":"But I said, I'm a member--\nhis membership card."},"2343":{"dur":3,"text":"I spent thousands of\ndollars here every year."},"2346":{"dur":3,"text":"It was like, wow, you're\na really good member."},"2350":{"dur":4,"text":"But if you want to say\nnice things about Costco,"},"2354":{"dur":3,"text":"we can offer you to write a\ncolumn in our magazine called"},"2357":{"dur":0,"text":"\"Costco Connect.\""},"2358":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm sure you get\nthose in your mailbox."},"2359":{"dur":3,"text":"And you can-- we love\nthe stories from you."},"2363":{"dur":1,"text":"And then so he showed\nme an alternative."},"2365":{"dur":3,"text":"And I said, I would really\nlove to speak on your intercom."},"2368":{"dur":2,"text":"And he's like, are you hungry?"},"2371":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm like, excuse me?"},"2372":{"dur":1,"text":"He's like, are you hungry?"},"2373":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm like, yeah, why?"},"2375":{"dur":1,"text":"How about I buy you dinner?"},"2377":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm sorry I can't let you do\nthis-- speak over the intercom."},"2379":{"dur":2,"text":"But I can buy you\npizza and hot dogs"},"2381":{"dur":2,"text":"and order whatever you want."},"2383":{"dur":3,"text":"And I walk out with a\nfull stomach that day."},"2386":{"dur":2,"text":"And I became an even\nbigger fan of Costco."},"2389":{"dur":3,"text":"And I spent a lot more\nmoney there afterwards."},"2392":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm sure those pizza\nand hot dogs are worth it."},"2394":{"dur":3,"text":"Of course, that video got viewed\nby tons of people as well."},"2398":{"dur":3,"text":"But the thing is not only\nhe showed me an alternative."},"2401":{"dur":2,"text":"He also made me a concession."},"2403":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, concession not--\npizza and hot dogs."},"2406":{"dur":1,"text":"That's not what I mean."},"2407":{"dur":3,"text":"But he made a concession\nto give me something."},"2410":{"dur":2,"text":"So how can I feel bad when\nI get rejected like that?"},"2413":{"dur":2,"text":"So there are just a lot\nof lessons I learned."},"2416":{"dur":1,"text":"For time-- for reason\nof time, there's"},"2417":{"dur":1,"text":"one last thing I\njust want to share"},"2419":{"dur":1,"text":"with you is just two words."},"2420":{"dur":2,"text":"Just ask."},"2423":{"dur":4,"text":"This is the most important\nlesson I learned."},"2427":{"dur":3,"text":"I remember, I told you flew\nsomeone's plane right once."},"2431":{"dur":0,"text":"It was awesome."},"2432":{"dur":1,"text":"When I think about\nflying, I really"},"2434":{"dur":3,"text":"think about just going to the\nairport, taking off my belt"},"2438":{"dur":2,"text":"and shoes walking through\nthat security check"},"2440":{"dur":2,"text":"and get scanned by\nthat bone scanner."},"2443":{"dur":3,"text":"And it will give me\ncancer some day for sure."},"2446":{"dur":3,"text":"And just charging my phones--\nsitting on dirty carpet."},"2449":{"dur":2,"text":"That's my thought of flying."},"2451":{"dur":3,"text":"That day I flew like a bird."},"2454":{"dur":1,"text":"It was awesome."},"2456":{"dur":2,"text":"And just for one minute,\nI was a couple feet"},"2458":{"dur":1,"text":"above the cornfield."},"2460":{"dur":3,"text":"I felt like a seagull looking\nfor fish above the ocean."},"2463":{"dur":2,"text":"And next minute I was like\n1,000 feet in the air."},"2466":{"dur":1,"text":"There was a cloud all around me."},"2467":{"dur":0,"text":"I was kissing it."},"2468":{"dur":1,"text":"I felt like an eagle."},"2470":{"dur":1,"text":"It was the best flying\nexperience in my life."},"2471":{"dur":2,"text":"I never thought flying\nwas possible like that."},"2474":{"dur":2,"text":"But then all this\ntime, there's only one"},"2477":{"dur":3,"text":"thing I could think\nabout was what"},"2480":{"dur":2,"text":"if I hadn't asked this person?"},"2483":{"dur":2,"text":"I would not have that\namazing experience."},"2486":{"dur":2,"text":"Then in our lives what\nif we don't ask stuff?"},"2488":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe companies\nmight not be built."},"2491":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe art may not be shared."},"2493":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe careers may\nnot be advanced."},"2494":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe business\nopportunities might be lost."},"2497":{"dur":2,"text":"The reason we don't\nask is because we"},"2500":{"dur":4,"text":"think the rejection is something\nso painful and so negative."},"2504":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's a biological\nreason for that"},"2506":{"dur":3,"text":"as well going back to our\nancient hunter and gatherer"},"2509":{"dur":0,"text":"days."},"2510":{"dur":1,"text":"But we feel that pain."},"2511":{"dur":2,"text":"We would try everything to\navoid being in that situation."},"2514":{"dur":1,"text":"So we don't ask."},"2515":{"dur":4,"text":"And so by avoiding a negatives,\nwe're getting positive, right?"},"2519":{"dur":2,"text":"That's actually just a\nlie we tell ourselves"},"2521":{"dur":2,"text":"every day because when we're not\ngoing in there getting rejected"},"2524":{"dur":3,"text":"and asking, we're just getting--\nwe're basically rejecting"},"2528":{"dur":4,"text":"ourselves by default. And we're\ngetting ignored by the world."},"2532":{"dur":1,"text":"So I just tell you,\nno matter what,"},"2534":{"dur":2,"text":"don't get ignored by the world."},"2536":{"dur":2,"text":"So what's next for me?"},"2539":{"dur":4,"text":"Remember, I told you about the\nstory of getting gifts, right?"},"2543":{"dur":3,"text":"Rejection was my\ncurse-- was my bogeyman."},"2546":{"dur":6,"text":"It haunted my whole\nlife until into my 30s."},"2553":{"dur":3,"text":"But as soon as I stopped\nrunning away from rejection"},"2556":{"dur":2,"text":"and started embracing\nrejection, I"},"2559":{"dur":5,"text":"turned this into my biggest\nopportunity and gift."},"2564":{"dur":1,"text":"I did my blog."},"2565":{"dur":3,"text":"And the blog I was invited\nto speak

help people to overcome"},"2585":{"dur":1,"text":"their fear of rejection."},"2586":{"dur":2,"text":"So it really became\nmy biggest gift."},"2588":{"dur":3,"text":"So I want to tell you when you\nare getting rejected next time"},"2591":{"dur":4,"text":"or maybe when you face a failure\nor maybe when you are seeing"},"2596":{"dur":1,"text":"obstacles, just consider this."},"2598":{"dur":2,"text":"This might be your gift as well."},"2600":{"dur":1,"text":"So thank you guys."},"2601":{"dur":0,"text":"Thank

people are\ntotally risk averse."},"2644":{"dur":1,"text":"They don't want to\ndeal anything with it."},"2646":{"dur":2,"text":"So it really depends\non this-- it totally"},"2648":{"dur":1,"text":"depends on the other person."},"2649":{"dur":2,"text":"I couldn't make the same request\nto so 10 different people."},"2652":{"dur":2,"text":"And they gave me-- each
