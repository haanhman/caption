way we do that is we\nengineer specialized proteins"},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"that are designed\nto recognize the DNA"},"306":{"dur":2,"text":"sequence around the mutation."},"308":{"dur":3,"text":"And now there are a number of\ndifferent classes of proteins"},"312":{"dur":4,"text":"called ZFNs, TALENs, homing\nendonucleases, CRISPR\/Cas9,"},"317":{"dur":2,"text":"all of who fundamentally act\nthrough the same way, which"},"320":{"dur":1,"text":"is they are designed\nto recognize"},"321":{"dur":1,"text":"a specific site in the genome."},"323":{"dur":1,"text":"They create a\ndouble-stranded break"},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"in that genome, depicted\nhere as splitting"},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"that blue bar into two."},"329":{"dur":3,"text":"And what we then do is\nwe

has"},"339":{"dur":1,"text":"the mutation."},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"And the cell, using a\nprocess called homologous"},"344":{"dur":4,"text":"recombination, will integrate\nthat donor correction DNA"},"348":{"dur":1,"text":"and correct the mutation."},"350":{"dur":3,"text":"It's actually, functionally,\na copy and paste mechanism."},"353":{"dur":3,"text":"So an Apple C, Apple\nV sort of approach"},"357":{"dur":1,"text":"that we're taking\nadvantage of here."},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"And so what we end\nup with is a cell"},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"with a mutation and\nthe gene corrected."},"364":{"dur":3,"text":"And this process gives\nus nucleotide resolution"},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"and is true precision\ntherapy in terms of we"},"370":{"dur":2,"text":"know exactly what we're\ndoing to the genome."},"372":{"dur":5,"text":"It was also mentioned earlier\nwas the problem of not"},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"every protein is druggable."},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"But because our\nnucleases can be designed"},"382":{"dur":3,"text":"to recognize essentially\nevery site in the genome,"},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"we can target every\nsingle site in the genome."},"388":{"dur":1,"text":"We can correct every gene."},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"We could correct\nany genetic defect."},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"So fundamentally, this\napproach allows us"},"394":{"dur":2,"text":"to say nothing is undruggable."},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"So schematized, we have a cell."},"399":{"dur":1,"text":"We introduce our\ncorrection fragment,"},"401":{"dur":3,"text":"and voila, we correct the gene."},"404":{"dur":4,"text":"And the strategy is much\nas Dr. Andrews described,"},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"is what we would like to do is\nidentify a patient at birth,"},"411":{"dur":1,"text":"perhaps through a\nnewborn screening,"},"412":{"dur":3,"text":"or perhaps even better,\nwhich is prenatally"},"415":{"dur":3,"text":"through genetic diagnosis,\nharvest the hematopoietic"},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"stem cells from that patient,\nuse our gene correction"},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"strategy ex vivo,\ncorrect the gene,"},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"take those corrected cells\nand transplant them back"},"427":{"dur":1,"text":"into the patient."},"428":{"dur":3,"text":"So if we could do\nthat, then this idea,"},"432":{"dur":2,"text":"because we have\nprecision therapy,"},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"then could be expanded into\na number of different axes."},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"So the obvious axis is\nthat you could say, well,"},"440":{"dur":3,"text":"if you're correcting sickle cell\ndisease or SCID, we could start"},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"using this approach to correct\nother genetic diseases,"},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"such as hemophilia,\nor cystic fibrosis,"},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"or the whole list\nof 10,000 diseases."},"452":{"dur":4,"text":"But the ability to precisely\nmodify the genome of a cell"},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"also allows us to think\nabout engineering cells"},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"to secrete therapeutic proteins."},"461":{"dur":1,"text":"And those therapeutic\nproteins might"},"462":{"dur":5,"text":"be useful in treating rare but\ncurrently incurable diseases,"},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"such as congenital heart\ndisease or type 1 diabetes."},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"They may also be able-- you\ncould use a cell-based therapy"},"473":{"dur":3,"text":"that's delivering a protein\ntherapeutic that might cure"},"477":{"dur":3,"text":"common but currently incurable\ndiseases, such as cancer,"},"480":{"dur":3,"text":"neurodegenerative\ndiseases, allergy, and HIV."},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"So what are we going to need\nto do to achieve this here"},"486":{"dur":0,"text":"at Stanford?"},"487":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, it's going to take\na vibrant, collaborative,"},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"and an interactive\ncommunity to succeed."},"492":{"dur":3,"text":"We need to have the technical\nexpertise in both stem cell"},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"biology, transplantation\nmedicine, genome editing"},"499":{"dur":0,"text":"to occur."},"500":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'm wonderfully\nsituated in the Lokey Stem"},"504":{"dur":1,"text":"Cell Building to do this."},"505":{"dur":1,"text":"We need the support\nof the university."},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"We need the support of the\nStanford School of Medicine."},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"We need the support of the\nLucile Packard Children's"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"And we need the support of\nour local community, shown"},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"in the lower right-hand corner."},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"And all of that is\nwhat's going to need"},"520":{"dur":3,"text":"to be done to really\ntranslate this process."},"524":{"dur":1,"text":"We're going to need\nsupport to convert"},"526":{"dur":3,"text":"what we do in the laboratory\nto a clinical scale process."},"529":{"dur":3,"text":"So in my laboratory, we can\ntake about a million cells,"},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"and we can deliver our\nnucleases and our donor vector."},"535":{"dur":3,"text":"And we can get correction\non the order of 1% to 5%,"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"which is actually\nclinically reasonable."},"541":{"dur":1,"text":"But what we're going to\nhave to do clinically"},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"is we're going to have to scale\nthat up by 100 to 200-fold."},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"And so you can sort\nof see that process."},"548":{"dur":5,"text":"And that's not an easy\nprocess, but we can do it."},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"The other thing we need\nis a specialized facility,"},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"a specialized\nmanufacturing facility,"},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"that will allow us to engineer\nthese cells such that they're"},"562":{"dur":1,"text":"safe to give to patients."},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"And Stanford has now committed\nto building this facility,"},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's going to be\nonline in January of 2016."},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"And we need to recruit someone\nskilled to run this facility."},"573":{"dur":3,"text":"And again, we're very fortunate\nto have recruited Dr. DiGiusto"},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"from City of Hope to\nrun this facility,"},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"a tremendous experience."},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"Ultimately, what we need to\ndo is not clone Dr. DiGiusto."},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that might\nbe a bit much."},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"But we're going to need\nto build bigger facilities"},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"and recruit more people because\nthe idea is not necessarily"},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"just to treat one, two,\nthree, or four patients,"},"593":{"dur":3,"text":"but to treat tens, hundreds,\nand thousands of patients."},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"We need the support of Lucile\nPackard Children's Hospital"},"599":{"dur":1,"text":"because these first\npatients are going to need"},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"to be specialized housed."},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"We're going to need to have\nthe specialized infrastructure."},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"And again, the extension\nof the new hospital"},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"provides us with\nthat infrastructure."},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"And ultimately, we want\nto have partnerships"},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"with industry and biotech."},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"Because as much as we're\nproud about bringing"},"617":{"dur":3,"text":"these novel curative\ntherapies to Stanford"},"620":{"dur":3,"text":"and delivering them at Lucile\nPackard Children's Hospital,"},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"ultimately these patients\nlive around the world,"},"625":{"dur":1,"text":"and we want to be\nable to deliver"},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"these innovative therapies\naround the world."},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"And the best way of\ndoing so is partnering"},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"with companies that have the\ninfrastructure, resources,"},"634":{"dur":3,"text":"and expertise in\nterms of doing this."},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"I will say there's always going\nto be a role for academics"},"640":{"dur":1,"text":"in this process."},"641":{"dur":3,"text":"First of all, biotech and\npharma, for very good reasons,"},"645":{"dur":3,"text":"is less prone to take on\nhigh-risk, proof-of-concept"},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"curative studies, and\nthat's where we fit in."},"651":{"dur":5,"text":"Second of all, while\nDr. Andrews suggested"},"657":{"dur":3,"text":"that GSK is willing to take\non ultra-rare diseases,"},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"we know that there's going to\nbe N-of-1, N-of-few diseases."},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"And again, I think academics\nplays an important

we come from perhaps\na more idealistic setting,"},"676":{"dur":3,"text":"we can be advocates to make sure\nthat these curative therapies"},"679":{"dur":1,"text":"don't just get to our\nlocal
