the drive home that night,"},"375":{"dur":1,"text":"we talked about how great it was"},"376":{"dur":2,"text":"to finally be able to go\nback to that place,"},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"and remember my

could,"},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"not just to create good habits in my life,"},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"but to get rid of those small habits,"},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"no matter how small they might

my loved ones?\""},"509":{"dur":4,"text":"\"This isn't fair.\""},"513":{"dur":1,"text":"But if I'd learned anything,"},"514":{"dur":4,"text":"it was that that way of thinking\nwould hold me

loss."},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"So I sat down and I wrote a list"},"528":{"dur":4,"text":"of all the things mentally\nstrong people don't do."},"532":{"dur":1,"text":"And I read over that

kept reading\nthat list over and over."},"543":{"dur":1,"text":"And I really needed it."},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"Because within a few weeks of writing it,"},"547":{"dur":4,"text":"Steve's dad passed away."},"552":{"dur":4,"text":"My journey taught me that the secret\nto being mentally strong,"},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"was that you had to give up\nyour bad mental habits."},"561":{"dur":2,"text":"Mental strength is a lot\nlike physical strength."},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"If you wanted to be physically strong,"},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"you'd need to go to the gym\nand lift weights."},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"But if you really wanted to see results,"},"571":{"dur":3,"text":"you'd also have to give up\neating junk food."},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"Mental strength is the same."},"576":{"dur":1,"text":"If you want to be mentally strong,"},"578":{"dur":3,"text":"you need good habits\nlike practicing gratitude."},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"But you also have to give up bad habits,"},"583":{"dur":3,"text":"like resenting somebody else's success."},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"No matter how often that happens,"},"589":{"dur":3,"text":"it will hold you back."},"593":{"dur":4,"text":"So, how do you train\nyour brain to think differently?"},"597":{"dur":3,"text":"How do you give up those bad mental habits"},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"that you've carried around with you?"},"603":{"dur":4,"text":"It starts by countering those\nunhealthy beliefs that I talked about,"},"607":{"dur":3,"text":"with healthier ones."},"610":{"dur":3,"text":"For example, unhealthy\nbeliefs about ourselves"},"613":{"dur":3,"text":"mostly come about because we're \nuncomfortable with our feelings."},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"Feeling sad, or hurt, or angry, or scared,"},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"those things are all uncomfortable."},"622":{"dur":3,"text":"So we go to great lengths\nto avoid that discomfort."},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"We try to escape it"},"628":{"dur":3,"text":"by doing things like hosting a pity party."},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"And although that's\na temporary distraction,"},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"it just prolongs the pain."},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"The only way to get through \nuncomfortable emotions,"},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"the only way to deal with them,\nis you have to go through them."},"642":{"dur":3,"text":"To let yourself feel sad,\nand then move on."},"646":{"dur":1,"text":"To gain confidence in your ability"},"647":{"dur":3,"text":"to deal with that discomfort."},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"Unhealthy beliefs about others come about"},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"because we compare\nourselves to other people."},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"We think that they're\neither above us or below us."},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"Or we think that they can\ncontrol how we feel."},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"Or that we can control how they behave."},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"Or we blame them for holding us back."},"667":{"dur":3,"text":"But really, it's our own\nchoices that do that."},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"You have to accept\nthat you're your own person,"},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"and other people are separate from you."},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"The only person you should\ncompare yourself to,"},"678":{"dur":4,"text":"is the person that you were yesterday."},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"And unhealthy beliefs\nabout the world come about"},"685":{"dur":3,"text":"because deep down,\nwe want the world to be fair."},"689":{"dur":3,"text":"We want to think that if we\nput in enough good deeds,"},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"enough good things will happen to us."},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"Or if we tough it out\nthrough enough bad times,"},"697":{"dur":3,"text":"we'll get some sort of reward."},"700":{"dur":4,"text":"But ultimately you have\nto accept that life isn't fair."},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"And that can be liberating."},"706":{"dur":3,"text":"Yeah, it means you won't necessarily\nbe rewarded for your goodness,"},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"but it also means no matter\nhow much you've suffered,"},"712":{"dur":3,"text":"you're not doomed to keep suffering."},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"The world doesn't work that way."},"719":{"dur":3,"text":"Your world is what you make it."},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"But of course before you\ncan change your world,"},"725":{"dur":3,"text":"you have to believe\nthat you can change it."},"728":{"dur":4,"text":"I once worked with this man\nwho had been diabetic for years."},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"His doctor referred him to therapy"},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"because he had some bad mental habits"},"737":{"dur":3,"text":"that were starting to affect\nhis physical health."},"741":{"dur":4,"text":"His mother had died from complications\nof diabetes at a young age,"},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"so he just believed he was doomed,"},"747":{"dur":4,"text":"and he'd given up trying to manage\nhis blood sugar altogether."},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact, his blood sugar\nhad gotten so high lately,"},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"that it was starting to affect his vision."},"757":{"dur":3,"text":"And he had his driver's\nlicense taken away."},"760":{"dur":3,"text":"And his world was shrinking."},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"When he came into my office, it was clear"},"766":{"dur":3,"text":"he knew all the things\nhe could do to manage his blood sugar."},"770":{"dur":4,"text":"He just didn't think\nit was worth the effort."},"774":{"dur":4,"text":"But eventually, he agreed\nto make one small change."},"778":{"dur":3,"text":"He said, \"I'll give up\nmy two liter-a-day Pepsi habit,"},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'll trade it in for Diet Pepsi.\""},"785":{"dur":5,"text":"And he couldn't believe how quickly\nhis numbers started to improve."},"790":{"dur":1,"text":"And even though he came every week"},"792":{"dur":4,"text":"to remind me how horrible\nDiet Pepsi tasted,"},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"he stuck with it."},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"And once he started to see\na little bit of improvement,"},"802":{"dur":3,"text":"he said, \"Well, maybe I could\nlook at some of my other habits.\""},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"He said, \"I could trade in\nmy nightly bowl of ice

beat-up\nold exercise bike."},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"He bought it for a couple of bucks,"},"820":{"dur":3,"text":"and he brought it home,\nand he parked it in front of his TV."},"824":{"dur":1,"text":"And he started to pedal"},"825":{"dur":4,"text":"while he'd watch some\nof his favorite shows every night."},"829":{"dur":2,"text":"And not only did he lose weight,"},"831":{"dur":3,"text":"but one day, he noticed\nhe could see the TV"},"835":{"dur":4,"text":"just a little bit more clearly\nthan he had before."},"839":{"dur":2,"text":"And suddenly it occurred to him,"},"841":{"dur":4,"text":"maybe the damage done\nto his eyesight wasn't permanent."},"846":{"dur":1,"text":"So he set a new goal for himself--"},"848":{"dur":2,"text":"to get his driver's license back."},"851":{"dur":3,"text":"And from that day forward, he was on fire."},"854":{"dur":2,"text":"By the end of our time together,\nhe was coming in every week"},"857":{"dur":3,"text":"saying, \"OK, what are we\ngoing to do this week?\""},"861":{"dur":3,"text":"Because he finally believed\nthat he could change his world."},"864":{"dur":3,"text":"And
