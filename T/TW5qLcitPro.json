reception, though?"},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"SIMONE GIERTZ: But you\nkind of slid out of it"},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"because it's very just round."},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"So I built a little\npodium under it."},"513":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that was the first."},"514":{"dur":0,"text":"But I did also--"},"515":{"dur":2,"text":"I remember I attempted\nto build a robot when"},"517":{"dur":1,"text":"I was seven or eight."},"519":{"dur":3,"text":"And I had this grand idea\nwhat this robot would be."},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"But all I got to was\nI got a block of

you"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"wiggled one end of the stick,\nthe other end would move, too."},"533":{"dur":0,"text":"I just built a robot."},"534":{"dur":0,"text":"It wasn't that

see the\nlittle videos of my projects,"},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, it looks like\nit's something for kids."},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"But then I'm just\nnot very

much."},"588":{"dur":0,"text":"No."},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah."},"591":{"dur":5,"text":"So I'm trying to find ways\nin which I can give kids"},"597":{"dur":1,"text":"good content to watch\nor watch
