that their\nclock slows down, and it slows"},"245":{"dur":2,"text":"down by a particular factor."},"248":{"dur":4,"text":"So if we were to work out what\nUsain Bolt's time is,

more"},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"accurately and this should\nbe a 7, 8 there."},"344":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is the number that Usain\nBolt actually ran the"},"347":{"dur":10,"text":"time that he

about the implication."},"371":{"dur":1,"text":"You could ask the question\nthe question."},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"So he's running it in a shorter\ntime it would seem."},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"Does

is completely\nequivalent."},"397":{"dur":3,"text":"So there is no change\nin their speeds."},"401":{"dur":1,"text":"So what's changing, then?"},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, actually, the answer\nis even more remarkable."},"405":{"dur":3,"text":"The answer is that from Usain\nBolt's perspective, that track"},"408":{"dur":3,"text":"is moving, and then because\nthat track is moving, it"},"412":{"dur":3,"text":"actually shrinks a little bit\nfrom his perspective by about"},"416":{"dur":1,"text":"50 millionths of a nanometer."},"417":{"dur":5,"text":"So he clocks a shorter time\nbasically because the track"},"423":{"dur":1,"text":"shrunk a little bit for him."},"424":{"dur":3,"text":"So you could say that he didn't\ncomplete 100 meters."},"427":{"dur":3,"text":"They
