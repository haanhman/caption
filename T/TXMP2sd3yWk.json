is actually the cast on right here."},"329":{"dur":6,"text":"And you're going to work ridges, then a mitered\ncorner, a mitered corner, more ridges, mitered"},"336":{"dur":6,"text":"corner, ridges, mitered corner, and we connect\nit to itself as we go around."},"342":{"dur":5,"text":"There are never more than ten stitches at\na time, on the needles, for this

needles possible, which"},"355":{"dur":1,"text":"is why I stuck to double pointed needles."},"357":{"dur":6,"text":"There is a little bit of risk of stitches\nsliding off one of the two ends, but I didn't"},"363":{"dur":1,"text":"have a problem with it."},"364":{"dur":3,"text":"But if they do slide off, it's only ten stitches\nto pick up."},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is the front."},"368":{"dur":5,"text":"The front of the blanket really shows what\nI call the bones of the blanket."},"373":{"dur":3,"text":"The back of the blanket, you can see, still\nvery pretty."},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"But you don't get the ridges."},"379":{"dur":3,"text":"Yeah, you get a ridge, they're both pretty."},"382":{"dur":4,"text":"Both sides seem like the right side on this."},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay."},"389":{"dur":8,"text":"So if you take a look at the pattern, it says\ncast on ten stitches, and slipping all first"},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"stitches, knit nine ridges."},"399":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's exactly what I've done here."},"401":{"dur":3,"text":"I've got a snag in my work."},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"Exactly what I've done here."},"405":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm going to encourage you throughout this\npattern -- don't count rows."},"410":{"dur":1,"text":"Count ridges."},"411":{"dur":2,"text":"You see these ridges here?"},"414":{"dur":1,"text":"All in garter stitch."},"415":{"dur":4,"text":"These are garter stitch ridges, and they're\nmade by knitting two rows, down and back,"},"419":{"dur":1,"text":"that gives you one ridge."},"420":{"dur":6,"text":"So give your row counter a rest, take it easy,\nuse just the easy way of counting ridges throughout"},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"instead of counting rows."},"428":{"dur":4,"text":"I will tell you that if you want to count\nrows on this first little section, that is"},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"fine."},"435":{"dur":4,"text":"The pattern tells you to knit nine ridges,\nor 18 rows."},"439":{"dur":4,"text":"But keep this in mind, your cast on will create\nhalf of a ridge."},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's actually casting on and knitting 17\nrows."},"447":{"dur":3,"text":"Once you get that you're here and you're ready\nto go."},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the easiest part, I'm not going to\ndemonstrate this

mitered corners."},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay."},"474":{"dur":5,"text":"So this is what you want to follow if you\nare keeping count of your rows, which I encourage"},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"for the mitered corners only."},"482":{"dur":5,"text":"Because it is 18 rows and then 16 rows, and\nthat's what I'm going to show you how to do"},"487":{"dur":3,"text":"right now."},"491":{"dur":4,"text":"On this little piece we're going to work a\nmitered corner to get us here, and then a"},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"mitered corner to get us here."},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"This is the only part of the blanket

you otherwise."},"516":{"dur":16,"text":"So I'm going to slip 1, knit 8."},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I'm going to do a wrap and turn."},"536":{"dur":3,"text":"But don't worry, because I'm not

have to."},"544":{"dur":7,"text":"You're going to yarn forward, slip that last\nstitch purlwise, and then it says yarn back,"},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"and turn."},"552":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay."},"554":{"dur":3,"text":"Now we're going to work the wrong side row\nhere."},"557":{"dur":4,"text":"Slip 1 purlwise, then put the yarn back between\nthe two needles."},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"This is all spelled out in the pattern."},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"And knit 9, which is to the end of the row."},"566":{"dur":17,"text":"And I want to keep track of

this\ntime."},"612":{"dur":4,"text":"And then I'm going to do another wrap and\nturn, not finishing up the end of this row."},"617":{"dur":7,"text":"So pull the yarn forward between the two needles,\nslip one stitch, yarn back, and turn the work."},"624":{"dur":5,"text":"Then Row 4, I slip that stitch back, and you\nsee I've given myself a little wrap around"},"630":{"dur":1,"text":"this stitch."},"631":{"dur":16,"text":"Then I yarn back, and I'm going to knit 8."},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"So you see what's happening here."},"650":{"dur":6,"text":"On Row 1 I knit 8, on Row 3, I knit 7,

it is easier."},"805":{"dur":2,"text":"You don't have to think about each step."},"808":{"dur":3,"text":"Slip 1, and knit 2."},"811":{"dur":4,"text":"I actually lost count, and I went and looked."},"816":{"dur":4,"text":"And I saw that I had a wrap on this one, and\nnot a wrap on this one, so I knew this was"},"820":{"dur":7,"text":"my next one."},"827":{"dur":13,"text":"Row 15."},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"Slip 1, knit 1."},"843":{"dur":5,"text":"And wrap the third stitch."},"849":{"dur":7,"text":"Yarn back and knit 2."},"857":{"dur":2,"text":"The rows are very short right

1 and wrap the second stitch."},"870":{"dur":6,"text":"I just slip 1, no knitting, wrapping the next\nstitch."},"877":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay."},"881":{"dur":6,"text":"So, Row 17 is the last row."},"888":{"dur":1,"text":"Look at how cool this is."},"889":{"dur":1,"text":"I love knitting in shapes."},"890":{"dur":4,"text":"We're actually not going to slip 1 on Row\n17."},"894":{"dur":3,"text":"We just knit that first one and wrap the next\nstitch."},"897":{"dur":2,"text":"It looks like I already did that one!"},"899":{"dur":1,"text":"Did I?"},"901":{"dur":4,"text":"Could be an optical illusion."},"905":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay."},"907":{"dur":3,"text":"That is the first half of the mitered corner."},"911":{"dur":5,"text":"And now we're going to work the second half\nto get us into a square and ready to start"},"916":{"dur":1,"text":"the other direction."},"918":{"dur":4,"text":"And so Row 1, we reverse the process on this,\nstarting over with Row 1."},"922":{"dur":10,"text":"We slip 1, we knit one, and you're going to\nput another wrap on this stitch."},"933":{"dur":6,"text":"So it's exactly like we were doing before,\nexcept we're going to add a stitch each time."},"939":{"dur":4,"text":"And then Row 3, slip 1 knit 2."},"944":{"dur":4,"text":"Row 4, or Row 5, slip 1 knit 3."},"948":{"dur":10,"text":"And you're going to start increasing that\nnumber every time."},"959":{"dur":5,"text":"So that all the stitches are once again live\nand active on the needle."},"964":{"dur":7,"text":"And nicely, Frankie has written this out row\nby row for us."},"972":{"dur":4,"text":"So the first time you work it, first couple\ntimes you work it, you might want to do, use"},"976":{"dur":2,"text":"your row counter and make sure

here."},"1056":{"dur":3,"text":"And here is the flat side that I'm going to\nstart now."},"1059":{"dur":5,"text":"What's going to happen is I'm going to work\nacross, and pick up a stitch, and decrease,"},"1064":{"dur":4,"text":"and work back, and that's going to attach\nit as I move along."},"1069":{"dur":2,"text":"With never more than ten stitches on the needle."},"1071":{"dur":1,"text":"Now let's talk about attaching."},"1073":{"dur":5,"text":"This is where, working the flat side, we're\ngoing to count ridges, not rows."},"1078":{"dur":6,"text":"We worked 18 rows here for 9 ridges at the\nvery beginning, from the cast on."},"1085":{"dur":4,"text":"We want to pick up 9 rows along here."},"1089":{"dur":1,"text":"This is what I do."},"1091":{"dur":1,"text":"I count."},"1092":{"dur":4,"text":"And this time I only have 9 to pick up, because\nthis is a very short side."},"1096":{"dur":5,"text":"But these little bumps in the fabric right\nhere is where I know I want to pick up."},"1101":{"dur":3,"text":"And those slipped stitches really help with\nseeing that."},"1105":{"dur":3,"text":"This is going to be the last one,

the\ntechnique."},"1141":{"dur":5,"text":"I'm going to pick up 9 rows here."},"1147":{"dur":5,"text":"So I slip the first stitch, and knit across."},"1153":{"dur":4,"text":"8

up and knit a stitch right\nhere in the very very corner."},"1172":{"dur":2,"text":"This is different from how the other ones\nare going to go."},"1175":{"dur":4,"text":"So I put my needle in, wrap it and pull it\nthrough, and suddenly I have 11 stitches,"},"1179":{"dur":1,"text":"which is too many."},"1181":{"dur":5,"text":"So I'm going to pass that last slipped stitch\nover the stitch I just picked up."},"1186":{"dur":2,"text":"Like binding one stitch off."},"1188":{"dur":2,"text":"Now I'm going to turn the work, and work back."},"1191":{"dur":4,"text":"And this -- we're going to pause

to stab it in right in the middle of\nthat loop."},"1334":{"dur":1,"text":"Of that bump at the end."},"1335":{"dur":1,"text":"I pick that one up."},"1337":{"dur":4,"text":"I pass the slipped stitch

rest."},"1355":{"dur":6,"text":"Okay."},"1362":{"dur":9,"text":"We can start to see the connecting stitch\ncoming out here."},"1372":{"dur":5,"text":"And, I can tell I've knit 1, 2 ridges of the\nnine

V,"},"1393":{"dur":2,"text":"as you work across and pick up the stitches."},"1395":{"dur":3,"text":"Rather than poking into one of the garter\nstitch ridges."},"1398":{"dur":4,"text":"Then you'll work another mitered corner, and\nthis is where it starts to get interesting,"},"1402":{"dur":3,"text":"because the sides are longer."},"1406":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's what we're going to talk about\nnext."},"1408":{"dur":9,"text":"Placing markers to keep really careful count\nas you move along."},"1418":{"dur":9,"text":"Okay, you've made it through the trickiest\nparts of the blankets."},"1427":{"dur":5,"text":"I just want to show you how I use stitch markers\nto keep really careful count of what I'm doing."},"1433":{"dur":3,"text":"And before I go any further, you don't have\nto keep the careful count that I keep."},"1437":{"dur":2,"text":"I like doing that."},"1439":{"dur":4,"text":"And if you're just more relaxed about your\nblanket and everything, that's fine,

would have only two stitches."},"1453":{"dur":4,"text":"Everything turned out to be perfectly on track\nevery time when I counted it, and it was only"},"1458":{"dur":3,"text":"two stitches, two times in the blanket that\nI had to squeeze in an extra stitch."},"1461":{"dur":1,"text":"Because the count wasn't perfect."},"1463":{"dur":2,"text":"But I'm going to show you how to do it, maybe\nyou'll like it."},"1465":{"dur":2,"text":"It's kind of like a crossword puzzle or something\nfor me."},"1468":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's take a look."},"1471":{"dur":3,"text":"Here is a blanket with a little bit more done,\nas you can see."},"1474":{"dur":5,"text":"Umm, here are my first two corners, the first\nedge, another corner, picking up from the"},"1480":{"dur":1,"text":"cast on edge, another corner."},"1482":{"dur":1,"text":"And this starts to get longer."},"1484":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's what most of this blanket is going\nto be."},"1486":{"dur":1,"text":"These long knitted sides."},"1488":{"dur":3,"text":"And the corners will be fewer and farther\nbetween."},"1491":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'm ready to start this side."},"1493":{"dur":4,"text":"And this side I have, it's always a multiple\nof 9 that I have to pick up."},"1498":{"dur":5,"text":"And I can see here that I have 9 once and\n9 twice to pick up."},"1504":{"dur":5,"text":"I've already counted 9 ridges and placed a\nmarker -- well, I went this way."},"1509":{"dur":2,"text":"I counted 9 ridges, and placed a marker."},"1512":{"dur":5,"text":"Then counted 9 ridges and as it gets longer,\nI'll be placing more markers to mark each"},"1517":{"dur":1,"text":"section of 9."},"1519":{"dur":5,"text":"And after I work the first ridge and back,\nlike I showed you in the last video, I always"},"1525":{"dur":3,"text":"put a clippie marker to mark the first ridge."},"1528":{"dur":4,"text":"Then as I finish up 9, I put a clippie marker\nin the next section."},"1533":{"dur":2,"text":"So I always know right where I am."},"1535":{"dur":7,"text":"It's not totally necessary, but it does make\nit easier if I am unsure about the count,"},"1543":{"dur":2,"text":"the most I ever have to count back is 9."},"1545":{"dur":4,"text":"And as you get further into the blanket, it's\nkind of a bigger deal, because you end up"},"1549":{"dur":4,"text":"with dozens of stitches to pick up, and you\ndon't want to have to count back through all"},"1554":{"dur":1,"text":"of those each time."},"1556":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's how I do it."},"1558":{"dur":4,"text":"The markers here, that I'm picking up, and\nkeeping track of how many that I've already"},"1562":{"dur":2,"text":"picked up, with clippie markers."},"1565":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'll give you a link to where you can\nfind clippie markers like this."},"1568":{"dur":4,"text":"You can also use safety pins or scraps of\nyarn, but these are easier to take out than"},"1573":{"dur":1,"text":"scraps of yarn."},"1574":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay, another thing I want to show you is\nchanging color."},"1578":{"dur":4,"text":"And I will give you, in

changing"},"1587":{"dur":1,"text":"color."},"1588":{"dur":4,"text":"I just want to show you that you have options\nfor how you want to do this."},"1593":{"dur":2,"text":"I wanted to work this blanket square."},"1595":{"dur":4,"text":"So I worked, there's my center square, there's\nmy next square."},"1600":{"dur":4,"text":"I worked three strips all the way around to\nmake a perfect square, and then I changed"},"1605":{"dur":1,"text":"color."},"1606":{"dur":5,"text":"If you want to make this blanket a rectangle,\nyou can actually take the color around one"},"1611":{"dur":6,"text":"more wrap, and

you that is how I changed\ncolors."},"1624":{"dur":1,"text":"At the square."},"1625":{"dur":2,"text":"Does that make sense?"},"1627":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes."},"1628":{"dur":4,"text":"The specific

blanket."},"1661":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm going to show you how to super secure\nyour blanket, so it can be machine washed"},"1665":{"dur":4,"text":"and dried, if that's the kind of yarn that\nyou chose to use."},"1669":{"dur":7,"text":"The one that I knit is a wool and synthetic\nblend which is machine washable, so this is"},"1677":{"dur":1,"text":"what I did."},"1678":{"dur":3,"text":"The thing -- I always tie knots and do this\nmethod, I've shown this in videos before."},"1681":{"dur":4,"text":"Because I would just be mortified, if I gave\nsomeone a baby gift, and they washed it, and"},"1686":{"dur":1,"text":"it started falling apart."},"1687":{"dur":5,"text":"So this is my super secure way of tying off\nthe ends so nothing can come unraveled."},"1692":{"dur":4,"text":"Let's go ahead and take a look."},"1696":{"dur":5,"text":"I'm going to show you on this sample, which\nclearly isn't finished yet, but I can demonstrate."},"1702":{"dur":1,"text":"And I have my tapestry needle right here."},"1703":{"dur":3,"text":"I thought I was funny, by doing that."},"1707":{"dur":6,"text":"I'm going to poke this end through to the\nback, because I'm going to consider this the"},"1713":{"dur":1,"text":"front of the work."},"1714":{"dur":4,"text":"So to get started I'm going to poke that through\nto the back, and weave it in back here."},"1719":{"dur":5,"text":"And if you're using a wool yarn that's going\nto be sticky and stick to itself, and not"},"1724":{"dur":5,"text":"be machine washed, you can just do a regular\nweaving in in garter stitch."},"1730":{"dur":3,"text":"I'll give you a link to the video I have on\nthat right here."},"1733":{"dur":3,"text":"This is the super secure way."},"1736":{"dur":6,"text":"I'm going to just weave this in, just a couple\nof stitches."},"1742":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not even anything fancy."},"1745":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, this is where the fancy trick comes\nin."},"1748":{"dur":5,"text":"I'm going to untwist the plies, half and half."},"1753":{"dur":4,"text":"And this is actually a wool yarn, that is\nclearly sticky!"},"1758":{"dur":3,"text":"And doesn't need to be woven in like this."},"1761":{"dur":2,"text":"If I wanted it to be really secure, I could."},"1764":{"dur":5,"text":"This is a two ply yarn, I've separated the\nplies, two and two."},"1769":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm going to thread half of those plies on\nthe tapestry needle."},"1773":{"dur":3,"text":"And then just take that half a stitch away."},"1777":{"dur":5,"text":"So that the two ends are coming out of places\nright next to each other."},"1783":{"dur":4,"text":"Then tie a double knot with those two ends."},"1787":{"dur":5,"text":"And really pull it tightly."},"1792":{"dur":5,"text":"Don't break the yarn, just shy of breaking\nthe yarn really."},"1798":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's really secure."},"1800":{"dur":1,"text":"And I can cut it really short."},"1802":{"dur":4,"text":"And it can go in the washing machine, and\nit's almost invisible."},"1806":{"dur":5,"text":"That's it, the Ten Stitch Blanket."},"1812":{"dur":3,"text":"Many thanks to
