What he doesn\u2019t do is say I exhale\ncarbon dioxide. He actually starts with an"},"598":{"dur":4,"text":"observation. He leads us really logically\nthrough this.

He can show\nthat it must be what he calls the bad air"},"699":{"dur":4,"text":"or our exhaled air, the carbon dioxide.\nBill: It\u2019s interesting that that highlights"},"703":{"dur":4,"text":"that there is a change. We breathe in air\nand we breathe out something. Naively and"},"708":{"dur":4,"text":"not unreasonably we would think that would\nbe air also. He\u2019s showing here that a chemical"},"712":{"dur":3,"text":"reaction has happened.\nDon: At this point, Faraday used an interesting"},"716":{"dur":5,"text":"phrase. He said that the atmosphere is \"spoiled\"\nby us breathing; kind of like saying bad air."},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"He doesn\u2019t really explain what this means\nyet. He will later and we\u2019ll see that it\u2019s"},"725":{"dur":4,"text":"spoiled for us but not for the plants.\nBill: So now what comes up next is really"},"730":{"dur":4,"text":"a key section of all five lectures. It\u2019s\nhis big unity of science moment. He shows"},"735":{"dur":4,"text":"us the analogy really deeper than that between\nrespiration and the candle."},"739":{"dur":4,"text":"Faraday: We consume food.

We may thus look\nupon the food as fuel."},"787":{"dur":6,"text":"Don: So a great point Faraday just made here\nis that we as humans rely on chemical reactions"},"793":{"dur":4,"text":"to survive, and that\u2019s something that\u2019s\nnot really an obvious point. These chemical"},"798":{"dur":4,"text":"reactions of course he\u2019s discussed at length\nand he\u2019s differentiated from physical changes."},"802":{"dur":4,"text":"He also then as Bill mentioned earlier, he\u2019s\nmaking a nice analogy here between our respiration"},"807":{"dur":5,"text":"and then the combustion of a candle.

Well,"},"826":{"dur":4,"text":"almost at least. He\u2019s going to show in a\nmoment that respiration produces CO2, but"},"831":{"dur":5,"text":"for now what he wants to do is just show that\nsugar contains carbon, which we know is necessary"},"836":{"dur":3,"text":"for fuel. He\u2019s made that point earlier.\nIn fact, we know from his many demonstrations"},"839":{"dur":3,"text":"and comments so far that carbon is produced\nwhen a candle is burned \u2014 it goes off as"},"843":{"dur":4,"text":"CO2 \u2014 although, recall with a piece of wood,\nwe also made carbon in that way. Here what"},"848":{"dur":4,"text":"we see - what we\u2019re going to see clearly\nhere is that carbon is produced when sugar"},"853":{"dur":3,"text":"is \u2014 and I\u2019ll put it in quotes here \u2014 \u201cburned.\u201d\nAlthough, it\u2019s a chemical reaction happening"},"856":{"dur":4,"text":"here, not really strictly combustion.\nDon: Yeah. We can see here, we have some time"},"860":{"dur":3,"text":"left, what\u2019s going on. It takes a few minutes,\nbut what\u2019s happening here is that the sulfuric"},"864":{"dur":5,"text":"acid removes the oxygen and the hydrogen from\nthe sugar and it leaves only carbon. Now the"},"869":{"dur":4,"text":"analogy here is really deep. To bring these\ntwo processes together calls for a sophisticated"},"873":{"dur":5,"text":"theory of chemical reactions. So his discussion\nis part analogy that humans and candles make"},"879":{"dur":4,"text":"carbon as a byproduct and this produces heat,\nbut it\u2019s part exact as well once we have"},"883":{"dur":4,"text":"a theory of chemical reactions. It\u2019s not\nmerely an analogy, although you have to dig"},"888":{"dur":3,"text":"really deeply into the chemistry to see how\nthe combustion of the candle and the reaction"},"892":{"dur":2,"text":"of the sugar and the sulfuric acid are deeply\nrelated."},"895":{"dur":1,"text":"So what\u2019s coming up next is Faraday"},"897":{"dur":4,"text":"is going to remind us of when he added the\npotassium to water. His point here is that"},"902":{"dur":4,"text":"a candle doesn\u2019t always burn even though\nwe know that it will burn if we start the"},"906":{"dur":4,"text":"wick on fire. Just being in contact, the wick\nin contact with the air won\u2019t have it burn,"},"911":{"dur":5,"text":"but if potassium is in contact with water,\nit happens right away.

He told us early in the lectures"},"926":{"dur":4,"text":"that there is no better window into science\nthan studying the candle. Notice what he\u2019s"},"930":{"dur":4,"text":"doing now.
