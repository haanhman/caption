recently."},"28":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah, I thought I should,"},"30":{"dur":2,"text":"I've been feeling quite bad for quite a while"},"32":{"dur":3,"text":"so I thought maybe it's time to see someone about it"},"35":{"dur":2,"text":"because I don't want to feel like this anymore."},"38":{"dur":5,"text":"Okay, so from your notes I saw\nthat you saw the GP about three months ago."},"43":{"dur":0,"text":"Yeah."},"44":{"dur":3,"text":"So how long have you been feeling down all together?"},"47":{"dur":2,"text":"Quite a few months before that as well actually,"},"50":{"dur":4,"text":"but it's gotten pretty bad these past few months"},"54":{"dur":2,"text":"so that's kind of why I came."},"56":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, so has it got worse since you saw your GP?"},"59":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah, yeah."},"60":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, so tell me how are things at the moment?"},"64":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, I kind of started just feeling a bit low"},"67":{"dur":2,"text":"and wound up about things,"},"70":{"dur":3,"text":"but I don't know, just recently"},"73":{"dur":2,"text":"I just can't really be bothered to do anything."},"76":{"dur":3,"text":"I kind of find it hard to get motivated for things."},"80":{"dur":2,"text":"I want to be, I really want to be better,"},"82":{"dur":3,"text":"but it's just kind of reaching the end now"},"85":{"dur":3,"text":"where I just want to do something about it."},"89":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay, so you said that you're feeling really down, really sad."},"93":{"dur":0,"text":"Yeah."},"94":{"dur":5,"text":"And you feel like you haven't got any motivation."},"99":{"dur":1,"text":"Are you okay?"},"101":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah, I'm fine, sorry."},"103":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, and you haven't got any motivation,"},"105":{"dur":2,"text":"but it sounds like you're putting quite a lot of pressure on yourself"},"108":{"dur":1,"text":"to try and feel a bit better."},"109":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah, I just, it's kind of hard as well"},"112":{"dur":3,"text":"because there's not really anyone to talk about some."},"115":{"dur":3,"text":"I just kind of stay on my own trying to."},"118":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't like to think about it but."},"121":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay, so you say you've been feeling quite isolated,"},"125":{"dur":1,"text":"there's not many people around."},"126":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah, there's no one in can talk\nto about it."},"129":{"dur":2,"text":"No one would listen or understand, anyway."},"131":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, so I'm just gonna try and\nfind out a little bit more about you."},"135":{"dur":3,"text":"So I understand that you're an English student at uni."},"139":{"dur":3,"text":"And you live away from home with some friends, is that right?"},"143":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah, I live, yeah."},"144":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, so you don't live far from the uni,"},"148":{"dur":1,"text":"but you say you live with your friends"},"149":{"dur":1,"text":"but you don't feel like you can talk to them."},"151":{"dur":4,"text":"Yeah, I mean they're lovely, I get on really well with them,"},"156":{"dur":5,"text":"but I don't know, recently\nwhenever they want to go out or stuff,"},"161":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't want to bring them down."},"164":{"dur":1,"text":"They don't understand what I'm going through."},"165":{"dur":3,"text":"They kind of, I don't know, they don't make fun of how I feel"},"169":{"dur":3,"text":"but they don't really understand what it's like."},"172":{"dur":4,"text":"I don't want to go out with them and bring them down or stuff."},"176":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, so it sounds do you try\nand hide the way you're feeling from them?"},"180":{"dur":2,"text":"I guess."},"182":{"dur":2,"text":"It's easier to hide it than to try and explain it all the time"},"185":{"dur":3,"text":"when no one really wants to know."},"189":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, so it sounds like you've been feeling down,"},"191":{"dur":3,"text":"you've been feeling unmotivated."},"194":{"dur":1,"text":"You feel like you want to be better"},"196":{"dur":2,"text":"but actually it sounds like you\nfeel like you can't reach out for help,"},"198":{"dur":1,"text":"you can't speak to anybody."},"200":{"dur":3,"text":"No, I don't really talk to my parents about it either."},"204":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's kind of hard."},"206":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, I'm just gonna go back in time a little bit."},"208":{"dur":2,"text":"I suppose I'm just wondering when did all of this start?"},"211":{"dur":2,"text":"You said it's been going on for quite a few months."},"213":{"dur":8,"text":"Yeah, I guess it kind of started"},"222":{"dur":3,"text":"actually when I was revising for my exams."},"225":{"dur":1,"text":"I guess the stress."},"226":{"dur":2,"text":"I put a lot of stress on myself I think."},"229":{"dur":1,"text":"I've always wanted to do well for me"},"231":{"dur":4,"text":"and I guess for my parents, so the stress of exams,"},"235":{"dur":3,"text":"and it was also kind of hard because my parents were going"},"239":{"dur":3,"text":"through a bit of a troubled time then so."},"242":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, so this would be like last March, last April?"},"246":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah, I think so."},"248":{"dur":3,"text":"Around that time, so about six months-ish,"},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"and it sounds like a lot was happening."},"254":{"dur":2,"text":"So you had a lot of uni pressure on"},"256":{"dur":4,"text":"and you said that your parents were having marital problems."},"261":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah."},"263":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay, and it sounds like that was a real shock to you."},"267":{"dur":3,"text":"Yeah, I guess it was hard as well because"},"271":{"dur":4,"text":"I wasn't doing well at uni and I guess I just felt a bit guilty."},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"I know it sounds silly but I felt"},"278":{"dur":3,"text":"like maybe if I could do better then they would get better"},"281":{"dur":3,"text":"but it just wasn't really happening."},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, so it sounds like you were trying to work hard."},"287":{"dur":0,"text":"Yeah."},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"And be more successful because you thought that that would"},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"make them happier and try and fix things."},"294":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah, I wanted to make them feel better"},"296":{"dur":4,"text":"but it just kind of backfired a little I guess."},"300":{"dur":1,"text":"How did it backfire?"},"302":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, it just ended up with them getting worse"},"305":{"dur":3,"text":"and I've just been feeling worse since then."},"309":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay, so after the summer, after the exam period,"},"313":{"dur":2,"text":"and how did that exam period go for you in the end?"},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"Not very well."},"318":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, that's an awful lot of pressure to put on yourself"},"321":{"dur":0,"text":"that you I suppose to think."},"322":{"dur":3,"text":"It's just annoying because I know I should have done better"},"325":{"dur":5,"text":"and I just didn't and I guess I beat myself up a lot about it."},"331":{"dur":0,"text":"Mm hmm."},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"So you say I know I should have done better."},"334":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah."},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean I suppose hearing it from my perspective"},"339":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm thinking it sounds like you\nhad an awful lot going on at the time."},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"It would be understandable absolutely"},"343":{"dur":3,"text":"that you wouldn't do as well as normal."},"347":{"dur":4,"text":"I suppose I'm just wondering if\nyou have very high standards for yourself?"},"351":{"dur":3,"text":"Probably, maybe more than other people."},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"My parents have always kind of taught me,"},"358":{"dur":4,"text":"in a loving way I guess, but that you should do your best"},"362":{"dur":4,"text":"but also get the best, and I agree with that."},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that's the right thing to think,"},"369":{"dur":4,"text":"but when I don't do that, I don't know,"},"373":{"dur":4,"text":"it annoys me a lot and I worry that it annoys them."},"377":{"dur":3,"text":"So it sounds like you feel you should always do your best."},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"Is that the words you used, yeah,"},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"and that there isn't any kind of exceptions for that but."},"385":{"dur":1,"text":"No."},"387":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay, so I can see then that\nthat was a really difficult time for you"},"391":{"dur":3,"text":"and that was when your mood started to get lower"},"394":{"dur":1,"text":"and things are still quite bad now."},"396":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean what's the situation with your parents at the moment?"},"401":{"dur":3,"text":"I think it doesn't sound good."},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't really talk to them a lot"},"406":{"dur":3,"text":"but I don't think they're going through very good things."},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't like to talk to them about it"},"411":{"dur":1,"text":"because it just makes me feel worse."},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay."},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"But I don't think it's getting any better."},"417":{"dur":2,"text":"Were you home over the summer?"},"419":{"dur":1,"text":"For a little bit, yeah."},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"Mm hmm, and how was that?"},"423":{"dur":1,"text":"Not very fun."},"425":{"dur":4,"text":"No, it was quite tense all the time."},"429":{"dur":4,"text":"It stressed me out more than\nrelaxed me over the summer I guess."},"433":{"dur":3,"text":"Mm hmm, okay."},"436":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, so it sounds then like quite a lot has been happening."},"440":{"dur":3,"text":"You've been feeling very low, you've had uni pressure on,"},"443":{"dur":3,"text":"you've had problems with your parents' marriage"},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"and sounds like you feel that\nyou can't really reach out to anyone,"},"449":{"dur":3,"text":"they can't understand, that you\ncan't really reach out to your parents right now."},"452":{"dur":0,"text":"Yeah."},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"You can't really confide in your friends."},"456":{"dur":1,"text":"So I suppose I'm just wondering if you can tell me a bit more"},"458":{"dur":4,"text":"about how you've been feeling, say this past week?"},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"Really not good to be honest."},"465":{"dur":3,"text":"I actually if I don't have to"},"469":{"dur":3,"text":"then I don't really leave the house or get out of bed."},"472":{"dur":3,"text":"I can't find the motivation for the things I used to join."},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"I used to love doing sports or going out"},"479":{"dur":4,"text":"and now I just prefer to lie in bed and not really do anything."},"483":{"dur":0,"text":"Okay."},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"I missed a few lectures this\nweek that I should have gone to but."},"487":{"dur":3,"text":"Right, so I suppose I'm just wondering then"},"490":{"dur":5,"text":"let's see if we can think about one thing, say a lecture,"},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"and what kind of thoughts do you have about"},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"going to that lecture before it happens?"},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't really see the point anymore."},"502":{"dur":4,"text":"If I can't do as well as I should be doing"},"506":{"dur":6,"text":"then what's the point in putting myself in those positions."},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"I can't be bothered anymore to try."},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"It just stresses me out more than it needs to."},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, so it sounds like the kind\nof thoughts you've got in your head"},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"are it's pointless, it's not worth it."},"525":{"dur":1,"text":"Do you have any other thoughts in your head"},"527":{"dur":4,"text":"when you're just at that point before you go to the lecture?"},"531":{"dur":7,"text":"So like, I don't know, I don't really even deserve to be here"},"538":{"dur":1,"text":"if I can't do well enough."},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"I feel these other students are doing well"},"543":{"dur":4,"text":"and doing better and want to be there."},"547":{"dur":4,"text":"I don't know why I'm here even at uni to be honest."},"552":{"dur":3,"text":"So it sounds like you feel like\nyou're not as good as other people here."},"555":{"dur":0,"text":"Yeah."},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, I'm just."},"559":{"dur":1,"text":"Sorry, is it okay if I take notes as we go through?"},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"It's just I'm trying to I guess understand what you're telling me"},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"and it helps me just to write it\ndown and I'll share this with you later."},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah, sure."},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, so it sounds like those\nare some quite negative thoughts to have."},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"You're kind of saying it feels like it's pointless,"},"575":{"dur":4,"text":"it's more effort than it's worth and I don't deserve to be here."},"580":{"dur":5,"text":"I mean when you have those thoughts how do you feel?"},"585":{"dur":4,"text":"Very unworthy probably would be the best way to put it."},"590":{"dur":7,"text":"Kind of, I don't know, just lower than normal."},"597":{"dur":0,"text":"Okay."},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"The thing it makes me think about"},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"all the things I should have been doing better."},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, so what you described\nthere when you said I'm unworthy,"},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"I should be doing lots of things better,"},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"those are kind of what I would call thoughts."},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"Actually I suppose I'm trying to understand what it feels like"},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"in your gut, what kind of emotions."},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"Do you feel happier, do you feel sad?"},"619":{"dur":4,"text":"What kind of emotions are you\nfeeling when you have those thoughts?"},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"Sad."},"626":{"dur":1,"text":"Not happiness."},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"No, sad."},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"A bit of kind of anger and frustration as well."},"633":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay."},"637":{"dur":1,"text":"I noticed when you're kind of telling me this,"},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"and I know this is quite a heavy topic,"},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"but you're kind of laughing"},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"and I suppose I wonder a little bit are you a bit,"},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"how do you feel about having these emotions,"},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"talking about these emotions?"},"650":{"dur":5,"text":"I guess embarrassed."},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"I've never yet to talk about it so it's quite uncomfortable"},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"to be in this situation."},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, well, you're doing a great\njob cause I know that this can be difficult."},"664":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay, so it sounds like some of the thoughts"},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"you are describing are it's pointless,"},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"it's more than it's worth,"},"671":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't deserve to be here, I'm unworthy."},"674":{"dur":4,"text":"And those kind of thoughts it\nsounds like they just flip through your mind"},"678":{"dur":3,"text":"and then you're kind of describing different emotions that those lead to."},"682":{"dur":3,"text":"You're kind of describing sad, anger, frustration, embarrassed."},"685":{"dur":2,"text":"What about in your body, what happens?"},"688":{"dur":3,"text":"How do you feel kind of physically?"},"691":{"dur":4,"text":"I used to be I think from those emotions very wound up,"},"696":{"dur":3,"text":"very kind of stressed all the time,"},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"but recently it's just been a lot more draining than anything."},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"Just quite lethargic"},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"and I just can't be bothered anymore"},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"and my body reflects that, but then when I try and sleep"},"712":{"dur":4,"text":"I just can't seem to have a satisfied night's sleep."},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"It's really, really frustrating."},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"So it sounds like this is affecting you,"},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"it's draining you of your energy"},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"like your body can't be bothered,"},"725":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that's a really good way of describing it,"},"727":{"dur":1,"text":"and you're noting sleep problems as well,"},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"and then what do you do?"},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is say we're back to the point before the lecture."},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"So you start having these thoughts, these emotions,"},"737":{"dur":1,"text":"and you know your body I guess it sounds like"},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"those thoughts are quite draining,"},"740":{"dur":1,"text":"so we're draining your energy."},"742":{"dur":6,"text":"What then happens? What do you do next?"},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"I kind of focus on the negative thoughts"},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"when I probably should not think about them,"},"752":{"dur":4,"text":"but I focus on them and then\nI don't really want to do anything,"},"757":{"dur":1,"text":"kind of stay in bed or."},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"So you think even more about\nthose kind of worries that you have?"},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah, dwell on them."},"763":{"dur":4,"text":"So you do a bit of dwelling and you stay in bed,"},"767":{"dur":1,"text":"and it sounds like you don't,"},"768":{"dur":2,"text":"you haven't tried speaking to your friends about it"},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"No, I don't see the point."},"773":{"dur":1,"text":"or speaking to family."},"774":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay, and then after you've done that,"},"776":{"dur":1,"text":"so after you've not gone to the lecture,"},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"you've stayed in bed, you kind of spent time"},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"as you said focusing on those thoughts,"},"782":{"dur":3,"text":"those negative thoughts, how do you feel after that?"},"785":{"dur":3,"text":"Do you feel better or do you feel worse?"},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"I guess I feel slightly worse"},"791":{"dur":4,"text":"but then a bit numb in a way,"},"795":{"dur":5,"text":"kind of once you've felt that\ncause I do feel tired all the time."},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"I just try and push it out"},"803":{"dur":1,"text":"and then you don't really think about anything,"},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's almost nicer that way than to"},"808":{"dur":2,"text":"keep focusing on how much you're getting wrong"},"811":{"dur":1,"text":"and how much you can't do stuff."},"813":{"dur":4,"text":"Sometimes it's better just to not think about it at all."},"818":{"dur":3,"text":"So it sounds like in some ways\nit's a bit of a relief to do that."},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"But in other ways maybe you\nthink it might make things worse."},"824":{"dur":3,"text":"Probably in the long run, yeah."}}
