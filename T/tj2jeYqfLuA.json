just\nsuch a simple tool that I learnt."},"29":{"dur":5,"text":"The way of being is this\n- Sorry, mother -"},"35":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Illegitimi non carborundum\";"},"38":{"dur":4,"text":"in essence, this means to be courageous."},"42":{"dur":5,"text":"It means to have tenacity, it means\nto have a huge amount of resilience."},"48":{"dur":5,"text":"It's the thousand things that go wrong\nbefore

happen."},"96":{"dur":2,"text":"I've seen that technology\ncan be the difference"},"98":{"dur":1,"text":"between first and second place."},"101":{"dur":2,"text":"I've seen that with technology,"},"104":{"dur":3,"text":"human potential can get\nto the highest possible levels,"},"107":{"dur":4,"text":"and human performance can do things\nthat we never realized would be possible."},"114":{"dur":4,"text":"It's been really a pleasure to work\nwith athletes all over the world"},"118":{"dur":1,"text":"to change the shapes of their bodies"},"120":{"dur":2,"text":"as they

the people\nthat create those shifts in the world."},"230":{"dur":1,"text":"I made a declaration,\nright then and there"},"232":{"dur":1,"text":"- as a petulant 15 year old -"},"233":{"dur":2,"text":"that I would create shifts in the world."},"237":{"dur":4,"text":"That's what I've been doing ever since\nliving under these words."},"243":{"dur":4,"text":"Yet, a really interesting thing\nstarted to happen."},"249":{"dur":1,"text":"Because every now and again,"},"251":{"dur":4,"text":"those marginal gains you were so convinced\nthat you're going to achieve"},"255":{"dur":2,"text":"didn't get the results you would expect."},"258":{"dur":2,"text":"The athlete wouldn't win."},"261":{"dur":4,"text":"Something else was happening,\nit's human will."},"265":{"dur":3,"text":"You all heard of the old adage\nof \"where there's a will, there's a way\"."},"269":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, absolutely."},"272":{"dur":4,"text":"But breaking habits, encouraging\npeople to smash their paradigms"},"277":{"dur":1,"text":"is the most challenging"},"279":{"dur":3,"text":"because also, where there is a will,\nthere is no way."},"282":{"dur":5,"text":"I've seen many raised eyebrows,\n\"Are you sure?\", \"I don't think so,\""},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"\"How much?\""},"290":{"dur":6,"text":"You realize that being in somewhat\nof a technical arms race"},"296":{"dur":2,"text":"is no way you see success."},"299":{"dur":2,"text":"Similarly, in a business environment,"},"302":{"dur":3,"text":"where, after five years\nand millions of dollars"},"305":{"dur":2,"text":"you have this wonderful,\nbeautiful technology"},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"that you know it could change the world;"},"310":{"dur":5,"text":"you

cheers,"},"321":{"dur":5,"text":"now, you'll hear people running away\nlike you just dropped the proverbial bomb."},"328":{"dur":4,"text":"So again, something else has to happen,\nand I figured you

critical"},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"of other technologies\nthat were just better."},"391":{"dur":4,"text":"I look at a lot of wearable technology\nthat fills our drawers and

responsible"},"444":{"dur":4,"text":"for selling rainbows\nwhere there's perhaps not a pot of gold."},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"So where are you in?"},"451":{"dur":3,"text":"Top right: technical epiphanies"},"454":{"dur":4,"text":"where technology enables\na new meaning in the world."},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"Because with new meanings,\nyou create new perspectives,"},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"and people start to perceive\nthe world differently."},"467":{"dur":3,"text":"When you perceive the world differently,\nbecause perception is reality,"},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"what you feel is what you believe,"},"473":{"dur":4,"text":"the behavior starts to change,\nthe movement starts to shift."},"477":{"dur":3,"text":"There are some really wonderful examples\nthat are set up here,"},"480":{"dur":3,"text":"some of you, I'm sure,\nyou're very familiar with."},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"There was a race for some time\nup and down this vertical

things;"},"546":{"dur":4,"text":"that's why I come back to this:\n'Illegitimi non carborundum.'"},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"the way of being,"},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"which by the way,\nthe literal translation is,"},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Don't let the bastards grind you down.\""},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"(Laughter)"},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"Because the world of technology\nwill continue to
