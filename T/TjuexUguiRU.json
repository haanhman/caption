of a room of people"},"78":{"dur":1,"text":"at all."},"79":{"dur":4,"text":"Because a few short years\nago, I was extremely shy."},"83":{"dur":2,"text":"Actually, shy is not even a\nword for it, actually at all."},"86":{"dur":2,"text":"It was more like\ncrippling anxiety."},"89":{"dur":2,"text":"Especially as a kid, I\nhated being in school."},"91":{"dur":1,"text":"I hated being\naround other people."},"93":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't know, something like,\nthey're all looking at me."},"95":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm sure one or two\nof you in the audience"},"97":{"dur":2,"text":"have seen or felt like that\nat some point in your life,"},"100":{"dur":1,"text":"especially when you're younger."},"102":{"dur":4,"text":"And so I started\nskipping school a lot."},"107":{"dur":2,"text":"And it went a little\nsomething like this."},"109":{"dur":3,"text":"Get up, get dressed, get\non the bus, go to school,"},"113":{"dur":3,"text":"and then immediately show\nup for maybe one class,"},"116":{"dur":3,"text":"or try to show up for a few\nclasses, or just turn around"},"119":{"dur":0,"text":"and walk home."},"120":{"dur":1,"text":"And it wasn't the\ncool kind of skipping"},"122":{"dur":2,"text":"school where you're going\nto fancy restaurants"},"124":{"dur":2,"text":"and dancing on parade\nfloats like Ferris Bueller,"},"127":{"dur":2,"text":"but the kind of skipping school\nwhere your parents come home"},"129":{"dur":1,"text":"at 4 PM or 5 PM and\nfind you playing"},"131":{"dur":2,"text":"video games in your underwear."},"133":{"dur":3,"text":"So that system, the education\nthing, the formal education"},"137":{"dur":3,"text":"thing really wasn't\nworking for me at all."},"140":{"dur":1,"text":"And I started to\nget my act together"},"142":{"dur":3,"text":"a little bit when I was\nolder, in high school\/college."},"145":{"dur":3,"text":"And I graduated from the\nUniversity of Michigan"},"148":{"dur":1,"text":"undergrad."},"149":{"dur":2,"text":"And my friends all had\nbright futures ahead of them."},"152":{"dur":1,"text":"They were going to\nwork at AOL, which"},"153":{"dur":4,"text":"was a big deal at that point\nin time, right, heard of that?"},"157":{"dur":2,"text":"And other people were working\nin finance and things like that,"},"160":{"dur":4,"text":"and buying their newly back\nin fashion acid wash jeans,"},"164":{"dur":1,"text":"and heading off to New York."},"166":{"dur":2,"text":"And I wasn't really sure\nwhat I wanted to do."},"168":{"dur":2,"text":"I needed a little bit more\ntime to figure it out."},"171":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm sure we've all\nheard that phrase,"},"172":{"dur":2,"text":"or used that phrase\nbefore as well."},"175":{"dur":2,"text":"And so one day, I got\nup bright and early,"},"178":{"dur":3,"text":"because I needed a new Discman,\nthe one with anti-skip,"},"181":{"dur":1,"text":"because when you're\nrollerblading,"},"183":{"dur":0,"text":"that's what you need."},"184":{"dur":1,"text":"Otherwise it bumps around\nall over the place."},"185":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think I just ripped\nspace-time with that"},"187":{"dur":1,"text":"'98 reference there."},"189":{"dur":1,"text":"But you need to\nhave the mega bass."},"190":{"dur":1,"text":"You need to have the anti-skip."},"192":{"dur":2,"text":"And frankly, 2 PM was\nabout the time I rolled in."},"194":{"dur":1,"text":"Because it was college,\nso bright and early"},"196":{"dur":1,"text":"is a relative term."},"197":{"dur":2,"text":"But I started talking with the\nguy that worked at Best Buy."},"200":{"dur":2,"text":"And he said you know a\nlot about this stuff, what"},"202":{"dur":1,"text":"are you doing after college?"},"203":{"dur":2,"text":"And I thought, well,\nyou're looking at it, man."},"206":{"dur":1,"text":"This is what I'm\ndoing right now,"},"207":{"dur":1,"text":"and maybe I should work\nhere for the summer."},"209":{"dur":1,"text":"I know how to fix computers."},"210":{"dur":1,"text":"I know how to build computers."},"211":{"dur":1,"text":"I can install software,\nremove software."},"213":{"dur":3,"text":"This is the late '90s or early\n2000s at this point, I think."},"217":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is a perfect\njob for me, right?"},"220":{"dur":2,"text":"I can easily fall\ninto this field."},"223":{"dur":1,"text":"And he said, slow\nyour roll, man."},"224":{"dur":3,"text":"You have to work selling\nmusic, CDs, and things"},"228":{"dur":3,"text":"like that, the remnants of the\ncassette section at Best Buy,"},"231":{"dur":3,"text":"before you can move up to\ncomputer repair and customer"},"235":{"dur":0,"text":"service."},"236":{"dur":2,"text":"So all my friends with\ntheir bright futures--"},"239":{"dur":3,"text":"I saw my bright future\ngo down the toilet"},"242":{"dur":3,"text":"in front of a life-sized\ncut out of Britney Spears."},"245":{"dur":1,"text":"So that system wasn't\nworking for me,"},"247":{"dur":2,"text":"still not working for me."},"249":{"dur":3,"text":"And I did what a\nlot of people do"},"252":{"dur":2,"text":"when they run out of\ncareer options entirely"},"254":{"dur":1,"text":"and they're backed\nagainst the wall"},"256":{"dur":4,"text":"and they feel like they have no\nfuture, and I became a lawyer."},"261":{"dur":3,"text":"And so of course, I'm stuck\nin law school thinking, OK,"},"265":{"dur":1,"text":"this just bought me\nthree more years."},"266":{"dur":0,"text":"Good plan."},"267":{"dur":1,"text":"Everybody says you\ncan get a great job"},"269":{"dur":1,"text":"once you get out of law school."},"271":{"dur":2,"text":"This is for sure going to be\na winning strategy for me."},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"And I really felt out of\nplace most of the time,"},"275":{"dur":1,"text":"if not the entire time."},"277":{"dur":2,"text":"I felt out of place the\nvast majority of the time."},"279":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's called\nimposter syndrome,"},"281":{"dur":1,"text":"and pretty much\neverybody has this."},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't know how you felt when\nyou got hired here at Google."},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"And everywhere that I go speak,\nthere's always some measure"},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"of people-- and we won't\neven do a show of hands,"},"290":{"dur":2,"text":"because it's so predictable\nevery single time--"},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"there's always some measure\nof people, the majority,"},"294":{"dur":3,"text":"in fact, who think that they're\nthe group or the person that"},"297":{"dur":2,"text":"slipped through the cracks,\nand that at some point,"},"300":{"dur":1,"text":"they're going to get found\nout, that they don't really"},"301":{"dur":1,"text":"know what they're doing,\nor they're not really"},"303":{"dur":1,"text":"as talented as everybody\nelse in the room."},"305":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's only a matter\nof time until they"},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"get found out, and\npossibly or likely fired."},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"And that is what\nI had in my head"},"312":{"dur":2,"text":"when I started working\non Wall Street."},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, the guy who hired\nme, his name was Dave."},"317":{"dur":1,"text":"And Dave was cool."},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"And no lawyers\nwere cool, really."},"320":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's kind\nof a general rule,"},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"but especially at\nthis particular firm,"},"324":{"dur":1,"text":"there weren't a\nwhole lot of guys"},"326":{"dur":1,"text":"that were doing finance\nthat were really"},"327":{"dur":1,"text":"well-respected by everybody."},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"And everybody thought\nDave was just the man."},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"And he was a guy from\nBrooklyn, and he had a tan."},"334":{"dur":3,"text":"So obviously, he knew something\nthat other people did not know."},"337":{"dur":2,"text":"When you're from Brooklyn and\nyou have a tan, take notes,"},"340":{"dur":1,"text":"Everybody needs to\ntake notes on that."},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"And this guy was never\nin the office, ever."},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"And if there's something that\nyou might know about lawyers,"},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"it's that they bill in\nsix-minute increments"},"349":{"dur":0,"text":"generally."},"350":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is what they're\ndoing when they're"},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"in every phase of\ntheir work day,"},"354":{"dur":2,"text":"they're billing in these\nlittle increments of time."},"357":{"dur":3,"text":"So they stay in the office\nall day, oftentimes all night."},"360":{"dur":3,"text":"And everybody was working\nall the time, especially"},"363":{"dur":3,"text":"on Wall Street in 2007-2008."},"367":{"dur":4,"text":"One time I went up to my office\non a Saturday night, maybe even"},"371":{"dur":1,"text":"a Friday night, to show\nit off to my friends."},"373":{"dur":1,"text":"This is probably my\nfirst month on the job."},"374":{"dur":1,"text":"And I thought, I'm going to\ngo up in this big Manhattan"},"376":{"dur":1,"text":"skyscraper, open up\na bottle of whisky."},"378":{"dur":1,"text":"We're going to hang\nout in my office,"},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"and talk about how we all\nfinally made it to New York"},"382":{"dur":1,"text":"and we're doing really well."},"383":{"dur":1,"text":"And when I opened\nthe elevator door"},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"on the 42nd floor of\nWorld Financial Number 2,"},"388":{"dur":2,"text":"the place looked\nlike Monday morning."},"390":{"dur":1,"text":"Everybody was in there."},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm talking everybody,\nexcept for our summer"},"394":{"dur":1,"text":"class, which is what I was in."},"395":{"dur":1,"text":"All the partners were there."},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"All of the associates,\njunior and senior were there."},"400":{"dur":1,"text":"They were closing\nsome deal, and it"},"401":{"dur":1,"text":"was kind of a normal situation."},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"I didn't know that at the time."},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"I actually went back\nin the elevator,"},"406":{"dur":1,"text":"pushed the ground floor button,\nand got the hell out of there,"},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"obviously, as fast as I\ncould, before they gave me"},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"some paperwork or some\ndocuments to review."},"412":{"dur":1,"text":"Because I wanted\nto continue my life"},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"and my evening and my weekend."},"415":{"dur":1,"text":"But what ended up being\nreally frightening"},"417":{"dur":2,"text":"was when I went back to\nwork on Monday morning,"},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"I asked a senior\nassociate, what's the deal?"},"421":{"dur":3,"text":"Why are there so many people\nin the office on a weekend?"},"425":{"dur":1,"text":"Are we closing a big deal?"},"427":{"dur":1,"text":"Or we short-staffed?"},"428":{"dur":0,"text":"What's the problem?"},"429":{"dur":3,"text":"And he said, no man, we're\nalways here at this time."},"432":{"dur":2,"text":"There's not a weekend that goes\nby that we're not here 10:00"},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"PM, 11:00 PM, 1:00-2:00\nin the morning."},"437":{"dur":1,"text":"If there's any work to\nbe had, we're doing it."},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, we bill in\nsix-minute increments."},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"There's one guy that wasn't\nthere, besides me of course."},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"Dave was not there."},"446":{"dur":1,"text":"Dave was nowhere to be found."},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"Dave wasn't there at\n2:00 AM on a Saturday,"},"450":{"dur":3,"text":"and he certainly wasn't there\nat 2:00 PM on a Tuesday."},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"And this was so confusing to me."},"456":{"dur":3,"text":"And luckily, Dave was assigned\nby HR to be my mentor,"},"460":{"dur":3,"text":"and not the kind of mentor\nwhere it's like, oh,"},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"we're on the top floor,\ndoing oyster shooters"},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"with Matthew McConaughey like\non \"Wolf of Wall Street.\""},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"Not that kind of mentor."},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"This is the kind\nof mentor where HR"},"471":{"dur":1,"text":"is like, you have to\nhang out with this guy"},"473":{"dur":4,"text":"twice, check the boxes when you\ndo so that we know you mentored"},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"this person during the summer."},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"And he was thrilled about\nit, as you might imagine."},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"Everybody else that was on\nthis mentorship program that"},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"was in the law firm was\ngoing to see Blue Man Group,"},"488":{"dur":1,"text":"to put a little bit\nof a time stamp on it."},"490":{"dur":4,"text":"To go out for drinks and\nhave $190 seafood lunches."},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"And my mentor was being\nforced at this point,"},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"now that I ratted\nhim out-- pro tip,"},"499":{"dur":3,"text":"never do that-- to HR, he was\nbeing forced to take me out"},"502":{"dur":3,"text":"for coffee in essentially,\nthe basement of our building,"},"506":{"dur":1,"text":"and mentor me by force."},"508":{"dur":4,"text":"And what that entailed was him\nbanging away on his BlackBerry"},"512":{"dur":3,"text":"with a full keyboard and\nblack and white screen,"},"516":{"dur":1,"text":"probably playing\n\"Brick Breaker,\" which"},"517":{"dur":1,"text":"is still one of the\nbest games of all time"},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"on any mobile platform."},"521":{"dur":4,"text":"He asked me-- or told me,\nrather-- to ask him anything."},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"And at this point, I\ndidn't have a whole lot"},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"of questions lined up, right?"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"I had just figured mentorship\nwas kind of unidirectional."},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"I didn't know that I had to\nplay a part in this other"},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"than showing up, which shows\nmy understanding of Wall"},"538":{"dur":1,"text":"Street at that time."},"539":{"dur":1,"text":"But he didn't have\na clue either."},"541":{"dur":1,"text":"So the first\nquestion that I asked"},"542":{"dur":1,"text":"him was something\nthat I was pretty sure"},"544":{"dur":1,"text":"was going to get me fired."},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"But I didn't care at this point."},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"Because again, I thought\nit's only a matter of time"},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"till they find me out\nanyway, I might as well get"},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"this one of my chest."},"552":{"dur":3,"text":"And I said, how come everyone\nis always in the office, always"},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"billing hours, always billing\nin six-minute increments,"},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"but you're never here."},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"What are you doing all day?"},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"What do you do at our law firm?"},"565":{"dur":4,"text":"And he put down his BlackBerry,\nand he leaned in, and he said,"},"569":{"dur":1,"text":"who's talking about\nwhat I do all day?"},"570":{"dur":1,"text":"And at this point,\nI'm just like,"},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"this is how you get\nfired at Starbucks."},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"For sure, in front\nof all these people,"},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going to get reamed out\nby a partner and walk home."},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"I'mma leave my phone there."},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not going to\ngo back and get it."},"582":{"dur":0,"text":"This is the end."},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"It's going to be the most\nembarrassing time in my life."},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"And of course, I\nbacktracked like crazy."},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"And I said, well,\nsome people here maybe"},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"have mentioned that you're just\nnot around a lot, I don't know."},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm busy working, so\nI didn't even notice."},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"596":{"dur":3,"text":"But he goes well look, let\nme be honest with you man,"},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"I bring in all of the deals\nfor our real estate department."},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"I go out and I meet potential\nclients, which at that point"},"605":{"dur":1,"text":"were investment bankers."},"606":{"dur":3,"text":"And I do things with them\nthat create relationships,"},"609":{"dur":1,"text":"and then they give us business."},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"That's why we have new\nmillion dollar deals"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"every couple of months, or\nevery quarter here at the firm."},"616":{"dur":1,"text":"And I was\nsuper-confused by this,"},"618":{"dur":4,"text":"because it didn't occur to\nme that going out and getting"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"relationships with people\nwould somehow bring benefit."},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"I thought people found law\nfirms in the Yellow Pages,"},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"and hired them and that was it."},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"Or maybe they were\nreally good at something,"},"631":{"dur":1,"text":"and so people noticed,\nand then they hired them"},"632":{"dur":0,"text":"because of that reason."},"633":{"dur":3,"text":"And that turns out to be\nonly part of the equation."},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"So what Dave was actually\ndoing was lead gen,"},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"business development,\nnetworking,"},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"relationship development,\nwhatever you want to call it."},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"But it was very informal."},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"The reason he had a tan\nwas because he was always"},"647":{"dur":4,"text":"outside golfing, or running,\nor cycling with these bankers."},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"He did ju jitsu, which\nmade him walk with a limp."},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"By the way, I don't know\nwhy people still do that."},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"Everybody I know who\ndoes ju jitsu is injured."},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"But he would go on\ncharity cruises."},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"He would go out to lunch\nwith people all the time."},"663":{"dur":1,"text":"He would go on charity dinners."},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"He was always gone for the\nweekend at someone's house"},"667":{"dur":1,"text":"in the Hamptons."},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"And at that time,\nbeing 26, 27 years old,"},"671":{"dur":3,"text":"that sounded amazing, not just\nbecause it sounded relatively"},"674":{"dur":3,"text":"easier than checking for\ncommas in 800-page documents,"},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"which is what I was\ndoing most of the time,"},"679":{"dur":4,"text":"but because I actually had\nsome inkling that I would never"},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"get better at the\nlawyer side of things."},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"I couldn't make myself smarter."},"688":{"dur":3,"text":"And my competitive\nadvantages had evaporated."},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"Because when I was a kid,\nI got by a little bit"},"693":{"dur":1,"text":"on general smarts."},"695":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm sure y'all are\nfamiliar with that."},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"You go to school, and\nyou just kind of show up,"},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's not that hard, right?"},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"All the way through high school,\nbut then you get to college,"},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"and even if everyone is as\nsmart as you, 90% of the people"},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"there are drinking their\nface off every single day."},"707":{"dur":3,"text":"And you just kind of have\nto focus in even a minor way"},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"to outdo those folks,\nand outwork them."},"713":{"dur":1,"text":"And that worked in\nlaw school as well."},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"But by the time you\nget to Wall Street,"},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"everybody is willing to\nwork, and everybody is smart."},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"And I was sure as heck convinced\nthat they were smarter than me."},"724":{"dur":1,"text":"And that became a\nhuge problem, because"},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"any competitive advantage\nthat I had been leaning on"},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"for my entire life\nhad essentially"},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"evaporated the moment I walked\nin the door of that firm."},"732":{"dur":1,"text":"And I started at the\nbottom of the totem pole,"},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"with no plan on how\nto work my way up."},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"And so the things that\nDave was talking about,"},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"this networking, this\nrelationship development, this"},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"changed the way that I\nlooked at work forever."},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"Because if he can\nlearn this skill set,"},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"or if he can have this,\nand I can maybe figure out"},"749":{"dur":1,"text":"how to do part of that stuff--"},"751":{"dur":3,"text":"if I can figure out some ways in\nwhich I can increase my skills"},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"in that area, by the time all\nthese really smart people that"},"757":{"dur":3,"text":"are working with me on the same\nlevel figure out they even need"},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"to do this, I'll already\nhave a four-, five-,"},"763":{"dur":0,"text":"six-year advantage."},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll have a long\nleg up in this race."},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"This is kind of a tortoise and\nthe hare-type thing, right?"},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"So if I start now, maybe if\nI stick around long enough"},"772":{"dur":1,"text":"and don't get fired\nbefore then, I'll"},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"actually have a fighting\nchance at making partner."},"776":{"dur":3,"text":"That's my plan to get to\nthe top of the law game."},"779":{"dur":1,"text":"You know how that\nturned out, so I"},"780":{"dur":1,"text":"don't need to explain that one."},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"But this was just such a\nmassive, massive realization"},"784":{"dur":0,"text":"for me."},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"And it really, really\nchanged the way"},"787":{"dur":1,"text":"that I started to think\nabout
