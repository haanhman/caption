I'm here\nto tell you a bit of a story about"},"20":{"dur":5,"text":"why I got interested in the link between\ncorporate psychopaths and bullying."},"26":{"dur":2,"text":"A long time ago, in a land far away,"},"29":{"dur":2,"text":"I was running a business\nin the Far East,"},"31":{"dur":2,"text":"and, as a part of that,\nI was moved offices."},"34":{"dur":4,"text":"And when I was moved offices,\nI was told I was getting a new boss."},"39":{"dur":2,"text":"And various people\ncame up to me and said,"},"41":{"dur":3,"text":"\"You have to be careful about this\nnew guy, this new boss you're getting."},"45":{"dur":3,"text":"He's very manipulative,\nhe's very ruthless, very cunning,"},"48":{"dur":2,"text":"and he's almost downright evil."},"51":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I thought, hm, this guy sounds\nlike a bit of a monster, a bit of a devil."},"55":{"dur":3,"text":"And when people say things like\nthat to you, that's what you expect."},"58":{"dur":2,"text":"You expect to meet a monster."},"60":{"dur":3,"text":"What you actually meet\nis an utterly charming man,"},"64":{"dur":3,"text":"in a well-cut suit,\nwho looks very attractive."},"67":{"dur":4,"text":"He's very sociable, very extroverted\nand he doesn't look like a monster at all."},"72":{"dur":3,"text":"He looks like your next best friend.\nAnd so, you get confused."},"76":{"dur":2,"text":"Then you think that these people\nmust have been wrong."},"80":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going to really enjoy working\nwith this person.\""},"82":{"dur":3,"text":"Looking back years later,\npeople would say to me,"},"85":{"dur":5,"text":"\"Well, how did you end up in\nthe circumstances that you ended up with?\""},"90":{"dur":5,"text":"And I could never answer that,\nuntil I read about corporate psychopaths."},"96":{"dur":2,"text":"And then it all clicked together."},"98":{"dur":4,"text":"So, that's my personal reason\nfor getting involved in psychopathy"},"102":{"dur":2,"text":"and corporate psychopaths."},"104":{"dur":5,"text":"And, as I started to read about bullying\nas a different part of my academic job,"},"110":{"dur":3,"text":"I realized there's probably\na large area of crossover"},"113":{"dur":4,"text":"between bullies and psychopaths\nin the workplace."},"117":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I started to look at bullying itself."},"122":{"dur":6,"text":"It's usually described as being\nthe regular and repeated belittling,"},"128":{"dur":5,"text":"or humiliating, or, in some way,\nintimidating a person,"},"133":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's usually a single person,\nin the workplace,"},"137":{"dur":2,"text":"on a regular basis, as I said."},"139":{"dur":6,"text":"So, it involves things like regular\nconflict, arguments, yelling,"},"147":{"dur":4,"text":"rudeness in the workplace,\ndirected at a single person."},"154":{"dur":3,"text":"It seems to be all over\nthe place, basically."},"157":{"dur":2,"text":"If you look at the papers\nto do with bullying,"},"159":{"dur":5,"text":"it seems to be in every organization,\nand significant numbers of people"},"164":{"dur":4,"text":"have experienced it. Usually\nit's in the 30 and 40 percentages."},"169":{"dur":3,"text":"And even organizations like"},"173":{"dur":2,"text":"the Departments of Consumer\nand Employment Protection,"},"175":{"dur":3,"text":"in Western Australia,\nwhere I was at the time,"},"179":{"dur":2,"text":"whose job is to prevent bullying,"},"182":{"dur":4,"text":"were accused by their own staff\nof having a culture of bullying."},"187":{"dur":3,"text":"And the staff insisted that they\nbring in private investigators"},"190":{"dur":4,"text":"to investigate the bullying\nthat was going on in the organization,"},"194":{"dur":4,"text":"that was there to prevent bullying.\nSo, it's all over the place."},"198":{"dur":4,"text":"So, that made me think,\n\"But, why? Why is it all over the place?\""},"204":{"dur":3,"text":"And the other thing that struck me\nin reading about it"},"208":{"dur":3,"text":"is that companies and corporations\nand organizations"},"211":{"dur":2,"text":"don't seem to know what to do about it."},"213":{"dur":5,"text":"They tend to want to sweep it under\nthe carpet, to pretend it doesn't exist."},"219":{"dur":1,"text":"And quite often, they'll do things like,"},"220":{"dur":4,"text":"they'll pay off the people\nwho are being bullied,"},"224":{"dur":4,"text":"and they'll insert a clause into that payoff,\ninto that contractual arrangement,"},"229":{"dur":3,"text":"whereby they're not allowed\nto talk about it."},"232":{"dur":1,"text":"So it all gets swept under the carpet."},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"The bully, in the meantime,\ngets promoted,"},"237":{"dur":5,"text":"and they're the only one that's\nleft in the organization."},"242":{"dur":3,"text":"But there are many ethical\nand financial reasons"},"245":{"dur":3,"text":"why bullying should not be swept\nunder the carpet,"},"249":{"dur":2,"text":"and some of these are to do\nwith individual reasons."},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"So, the negative effects,"},"254":{"dur":4,"text":"the psychological effects on the individual\nconcern are quite devastating."},"258":{"dur":2,"text":"So, they feel humiliated, belittled,"},"262":{"dur":3,"text":"their careers quite often\nget ruined or disjointed."},"266":{"dur":2,"text":"They'll try and withdraw\nfrom the workplace,"},"268":{"dur":3,"text":"they'll seek other jobs,"},"272":{"dur":5,"text":"and they end up in lesser positions,\nor unemployed,"},"277":{"dur":2,"text":"or in jobs they don't really want to do."},"279":{"dur":5,"text":"And their confidence and motivation\nis destroyed at a personal level."},"285":{"dur":5,"text":"But it also has an effect at a corporate\nlevel or an organizational level as well,"},"290":{"dur":6,"text":"because there's a typical\nfight-or-flight response to being"},"296":{"dur":2,"text":"in a conflict situation\nor to being bullied."},"299":{"dur":3,"text":"So, in terms of flight,"},"303":{"dur":2,"text":"people withdraw\ntheir time and effort."},"305":{"dur":7,"text":"So, they'll stop doing overtime, they'll\nstop their extracurricular activities,"},"313":{"dur":5,"text":"in terms of commitment to the organization\nand helping the organization grow."},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"And they'll fight back"},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"in terms of things like\ncounterproductive work behavior."},"323":{"dur":3,"text":"So, typically, if the bully\nis your manager,"},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"or your supervisor,\nor your boss in some way,"},"329":{"dur":4,"text":"you take him or her\nas a representative of the company."},"333":{"dur":4,"text":"And, therefore, your revenge is not\non them particularly, as an individual."},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"It tends to be against the company."},"340":{"dur":5,"text":"So, you'll stop working properly,\nyou'll sabotage normal work processes,"},"346":{"dur":5,"text":"you'll withdraw your effort and your\ncommitment, as I said, to what you're doing."},"351":{"dur":3,"text":"And the result of all that is just\nfurther conflicts within the organization."},"355":{"dur":5,"text":"The ethical and moral climate\nof the organization starts to diminish,"},"361":{"dur":4,"text":"and that has knock-on effects in terms\nof how you treat your suppliers,"},"365":{"dur":5,"text":"how you treat your tax returns\nand everything else to do with the company."},"373":{"dur":3,"text":"So, reading some of the literature\non bullies and bullying,"},"377":{"dur":5,"text":"there seems to be a sort of unspoken,\nunderlying sense of bewilderment,"},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Who are these people?"},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"Who are these people\nthat enjoy watching people get hurt?\""},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"'Cause it doesn't seem\na normal thing to do,"},"392":{"dur":4,"text":"a normal thing to want to do or to enjoy\ndoing, and they clearly enjoy it."},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"Reading about bullies,"},"399":{"dur":3,"text":"the words that are used to describe them\nare on the screen there."},"402":{"dur":3,"text":"So, they enjoy hurting other people,\nthey're cruel, they're selfish,"},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"they're parasitic, Machiavellian,"},"408":{"dur":3,"text":"and you start to get in the literature\na lot of words"},"411":{"dur":4,"text":"to do with a dissocial personality."},"415":{"dur":6,"text":"So, antisocial personality disorder,\nsociopathy, psychopathy"},"421":{"dur":3,"text":"and lots of these words\nare similar to words"},"425":{"dur":3,"text":"used to identify corporate psychopaths."},"429":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, corporate psychopaths\nare those psychopaths"},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"who are about 1% of the population,"},"435":{"dur":4,"text":"and just by the way, who go into\norganizational and corporate positions,"},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"rather than into a criminal career."},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"And psychologists have slowly\ncome to realize"},"445":{"dur":5,"text":"that those from better socioeconomic\nbackgrounds, perhaps with a good education,"},"450":{"dur":5,"text":"good family background, work out\nfairly early, that it's far easier"},"457":{"dur":4,"text":"to get the power, the prestige,\nand the money that they want"},"461":{"dur":3,"text":"from a corporate career\nthan it is from a criminal career."},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, they go into\nthe corporate world."},"467":{"dur":3,"text":"So, the same words are used\nto describe them, these psychopaths,"},"471":{"dur":5,"text":"as I used to describe bullies,\nwith the exception that psychopaths,"},"476":{"dur":4,"text":"the outstanding thing about psychopaths\nis they have absolutely no conscience."},"481":{"dur":4,"text":"So, there's nothing that inhibits them,\nin terms of how they behave."},"485":{"dur":4,"text":"They can be totally ruthless\nand sleep perfectly well that night,"},"490":{"dur":3,"text":"because nothing they do bothers them,\nbecause they don't have a conscience,"},"493":{"dur":6,"text":"and there's no feeling,\nno emotion in their lives."},"500":{"dur":4,"text":"So, having realized that there's\nprobably a large link"},"504":{"dur":3,"text":"between psychopathy and psychopaths\nand bullying,"},"508":{"dur":4,"text":"I thought it would be interesting\nto do some research"},"512":{"dur":3,"text":"to see how large that link actually is."},"515":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I took a psychopathy measure"},"517":{"dur":4,"text":"from reading 200 and odd psychology\npapers on psychopaths,"},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"and embedded it\nin a management survey"},"524":{"dur":5,"text":"of management behavior,\nfirstly doing this in Australia."},"530":{"dur":5,"text":"And what I found was one\nof the most outstanding things."},"535":{"dur":4,"text":"I found that psychopaths"},"540":{"dur":4,"text":"seemed to account for around 26%\nof all bullying"},"544":{"dur":3,"text":"in that particular sample of managers,\nof Australian managers."},"547":{"dur":6,"text":"It was 346 managers,\nresearch carried out in 2008, I think."},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"And there were quite a few other\ninteresting statistics there, as well."},"561":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, under normal managers,"},"563":{"dur":4,"text":"employees encountered bullying\nless than once a month."},"568":{"dur":3,"text":"If there were corporate psychopaths\nin the organization,"},"571":{"dur":4,"text":"then bullying went up to\nmore than once a week."},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"1.3 times a week,\nI think it was."},"578":{"dur":3,"text":"- And I measured lots\nof other things as well, besides bullying,"},"582":{"dur":4,"text":"but that was the interesting thing\nfor the purposes of today -"},"586":{"dur":5,"text":"Because those results were so dramatic,\nI repeated it again in the U.K."},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"And - Let's get the right slide.\nThat one -"},"599":{"dur":4,"text":"And I found even more bullying\nin the U.K. than I found in Australia."},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"And I found that psychopaths\nand corporate psychopaths"},"607":{"dur":5,"text":"were accounted for more of that bullying\nthan they did in Australia."},"612":{"dur":4,"text":"So, up to 36% of all bullying is down\nto the presence of corporate psychopaths"},"617":{"dur":3,"text":"in an organization, in this sample."},"621":{"dur":4,"text":"And the knock-on effects,\nmore yelling, more arguments,"},"625":{"dur":4,"text":"more disruption, more conflict,\nthen, when psychopaths are there,"},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"compared to when they're not there."},"632":{"dur":5,"text":"So, under normal managers,\neverything is, in terms of conflict,"},"637":{"dur":3,"text":"everything is lowered,\nand much more sedate,"},"640":{"dur":3,"text":"and much more smooth,"},"644":{"dur":3,"text":"and much less chaotic,\nand less confusion."},"647":{"dur":3,"text":"So...\nWhere are we?"},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"In conclusion, I think that what I've \u2014"},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"Having established the link between\ncorporate psychopaths and bullying,"},"659":{"dur":6,"text":"it starts to explain some of the big\nquestions that are to do with bullyings."},"665":{"dur":3,"text":"For example, why is it so pervasive\nin all companies,"},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"around the world and in all countries?"},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, the answer to that might be that,"},"675":{"dur":3,"text":"because psychopaths are 1%\nof the population."},"678":{"dur":4,"text":"If we assume they are normally\ndistributed across the whole population,"},"682":{"dur":3,"text":"then, in every major company\nthere will be psychopaths."},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"And if there are psychopaths,\nthere will be bullying."},"688":{"dur":5,"text":"So, that explains why bullying\nis so common."},"693":{"dur":5,"text":"The other thing it explains is\nwhy bullying occurs in the first place."},"699":{"dur":3,"text":"Psychopaths bully for two main reasons.\nOne of them is predatory."},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"So they do it because they like it.\nThey do it because they enjoy it."},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"They do it because they like\nto see people squirm."},"709":{"dur":3,"text":"They like just to hurt people,\nthey like to damage their careers,"},"712":{"dur":3,"text":"and that's the thing that's hard\nfor the rest of us to understand."},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"It's enjoyable. That's one\nof the reasons they do it."},"718":{"dur":4,"text":"The other reason they do it is\nwhat I've called instrumental bullying."},"722":{"dur":6,"text":"So, they're doing it quite often to create\nconfusion and chaos all around them,"},"729":{"dur":5,"text":"so that they can forward their own\npolitical and social and career agendas,"},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"while everybody else\nis emotionally distracted."},"738":{"dur":5,"text":"So, it creates a smokescreen for them\nto get on with what they're really doing,"},"743":{"dur":3,"text":"which is gaining power, and influence,\nand prestige,"},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"and money within the corporation."},"749":{"dur":3,"text":"So, anybody, for example, a boss\nlooking down on this whole situation"},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"of bullying and emotional reactions"},"755":{"dur":5,"text":"will see that the only person that seems\nto have kept their cool is this psychopath,"},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"because he started it all\nin the first place."},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"And therefore, the only person\nthat seems like they want..."},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"deserves promotion is the psychopath."},"769":{"dur":3,"text":"So, that's why it helps\nto answer the question"},"773":{"dur":4,"text":"of why psychopaths seem\nto get promoted at the hierarchy"},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"more than ordinary people do."},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"Because they create\nconfusion around them"},"781":{"dur":5,"text":"and that enables them to forward their\nown agenda to promote themselves."},"789":{"dur":4,"text":"So, if you link it\nat an organizational level,"},"794":{"dur":5,"text":"companies like Enron, which was\nthe biggest fraud in history at the time,"},"799":{"dur":3,"text":"before the global financial crisis\nand things like that,"},"802":{"dur":3,"text":"was reported to have a culture\nof bullying within it."},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"And they bullied their agencies,\nthey bullied their advisers,"},"808":{"dur":6,"text":"they bullied their suppliers to keep them\nin check and to stop them asking questions,"},"815":{"dur":3,"text":"so that they could perpetuate this massive\nfraud that was going on for years."},"819":{"dur":4,"text":"So, it's a means to an end,\nas well as an end in itself."},"826":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think bullying in corporate banks,\nfor example,"},"831":{"dur":3,"text":"and linking it to the global\nfinancial crisis, was very evident as well."},"834":{"dur":4,"text":"There is a culture of, \"Don't ask questions,\nor you'll get into trouble.\""},"839":{"dur":4,"text":"So, no ethical questions\nare allowed in these institutions,"},"843":{"dur":3,"text":"and it enables them to get on\nwith what they're doing, with their fraud,"},"847":{"dur":5,"text":"and it prevents people from exposing it."},"853":{"dur":3,"text":"If anyone is interested in finding out\nmore about any of these things,"},"856":{"dur":4,"text":"those are the things to look up\nin your search engine."},"861":{"dur":2,"text":"Thank you for listening.\nGoodbye."},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"(Applause)"}}
