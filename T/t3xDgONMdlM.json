stuff I've\nlearned over the past year."},"204":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm going to talk\nabout these four things."},"207":{"dur":1,"text":"The first is what\nevery traditional film"},"208":{"dur":2,"text":"person faces, which is a\nloss of a frame as a device."},"211":{"dur":2,"text":"The second is what\nthat means for editing"},"213":{"dur":1,"text":"and how something\nlike editing can"},"215":{"dur":3,"text":"be reworked to suit what we\nwant to accomplish in VR."},"218":{"dur":3,"text":"The third is the realization\nthat even though it's a camera,"},"222":{"dur":3,"text":"the camera actually represents\na human the entire way through."},"225":{"dur":2,"text":"And the fourth is the\nquestion on everyone's mind,"},"228":{"dur":4,"text":"storytelling, and how\nto do story in VR."},"232":{"dur":2,"text":"So let's talk about the frame."},"235":{"dur":3,"text":"The frame is a precious\nthing for a filmmaker."},"238":{"dur":1,"text":"It's our medium."},"239":{"dur":3,"text":"So we aspire to be masters at\ncrafting this kind of window"},"243":{"dur":0,"text":"into another world."},"247":{"dur":1,"text":"But a frame doesn't\nmean jack when"},"249":{"dur":2,"text":"someone can do this, right?"},"252":{"dur":2,"text":"And the whole point of film\nis that your audience never"},"254":{"dur":2,"text":"does this."},"257":{"dur":2,"text":"But in VR you do this,\nbecause if you don't do this,"},"260":{"dur":3,"text":"you're doing it wrong, right?"},"263":{"dur":1,"text":"So in traditional cinema,\nwe use the concept"},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"of the frame to make sure\npeople pay attention to what we"},"267":{"dur":1,"text":"want them to pay attention to."},"269":{"dur":3,"text":"We think if we lose the frame,\nwe lose complete control."},"272":{"dur":2,"text":"And this makes\nfilmmakers-- a lot of them"},"274":{"dur":2,"text":"are credible ones that have\nbeen around for a while-- makes"},"277":{"dur":5,"text":"them freak out, like this is\nhorrible, this is dangerous,"},"282":{"dur":0,"text":"and so on."},"283":{"dur":3,"text":"But let's just\nbreathe for a second."},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"Have we lost complete control?"},"288":{"dur":4,"text":"Or maybe it just lives\nsomewhere else in this."},"292":{"dur":1,"text":"Us humans have a\nknack for following"},"294":{"dur":2,"text":"what calls attention to\nitself, no matter where"},"297":{"dur":3,"text":"it is, no matter where it goes."},"300":{"dur":1,"text":"And in VR, we've been\ncalling these elements"},"302":{"dur":1,"text":"points of interest or POIs."},"303":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's important to note,\nthis does not just mean visuals."},"306":{"dur":2,"text":"We tend to hear things\nbefore we see them."},"308":{"dur":3,"text":"So spatial audio plays a\nbig role in this as well."},"312":{"dur":2,"text":"So let's take this\nglacier climber."},"314":{"dur":1,"text":"That's one point of interest."},"316":{"dur":1,"text":"He's the only human."},"317":{"dur":1,"text":"He's the only one\nmaking a sound."},"319":{"dur":2,"text":"And although we can't be\n100% sure, because we never"},"321":{"dur":1,"text":"can in VR, we can make\na pretty solid bet"},"323":{"dur":1,"text":"that someone will focus on him."},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"That's one POI."},"328":{"dur":2,"text":"It can become very\ncomplex rather quickly,"},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"because life is\nvery complex, too."},"332":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you take this tram scene,\nit doesn't present just one."},"335":{"dur":3,"text":"But it presents four\nor more possible POIs."},"339":{"dur":5,"text":"Or something like rocks,\nwhich is utter chaos."},"345":{"dur":1,"text":"But to be honest,\nthat just means"},"346":{"dur":3,"text":"that potentially everything\nis interesting to someone."},"349":{"dur":4,"text":"I just can't take any bets\nor place any bets on them."},"353":{"dur":2,"text":"So our control as creators\nis in this understanding"},"356":{"dur":3,"text":"of the potential experiences a\nworld contains so that we can"},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"prepare for this,\nprepare for how someone"},"361":{"dur":1,"text":"might engage with the space."},"363":{"dur":1,"text":"And our craft is really\nmore about, as creators,"},"365":{"dur":2,"text":"how do we respond to the\npotential experiences"},"367":{"dur":5,"text":"that someone has, if at all?"},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"Which brings me to this."},"374":{"dur":1,"text":"So when filmmakers\ntalk about editing,"},"376":{"dur":3,"text":"we talk about putting frames\nor shots in a linear construct,"},"379":{"dur":0,"text":"right?"},"380":{"dur":1,"text":"There's nuance\nand there's craft,"},"381":{"dur":1,"text":"but generally that's\nwhere we're going."},"382":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's what we talk about\nwhen we talk about editing."},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"It's shot to shot\nand frame to frame."},"386":{"dur":5,"text":"Now when we try this in VR, the\ncuts felt jarring and weird,"},"391":{"dur":4,"text":"and we pretty quickly\nknew that it did not work."},"395":{"dur":1,"text":"So what happened?"},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, for one, when we think\nabout representation of editing"},"399":{"dur":2,"text":"in VR, we think about\na predetermined frame"},"402":{"dur":1,"text":"to frame visual."},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's probably\nthe wrong approach,"},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"especially when the potential\nof the frame could be anywhere."},"408":{"dur":1,"text":"And so VR needs a\ndifferent visual"},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"for understanding\nthis potential."},"411":{"dur":2,"text":"And in trying to figure out\nwhat that visual could be,"},"414":{"dur":6,"text":"I started drawing lots of\ncircles, and lots more circles."},"420":{"dur":1,"text":"And each of these\ncircles was an attempt"},"422":{"dur":1,"text":"at mapping out the\nworld of a given shot,"},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"basically taking this\nand thinking of this."},"433":{"dur":6,"text":"So each shot is an experiential\nworld, the fundamentals"},"440":{"dur":11,"text":"being the visitor, the visitor's\nabilities, and the world."},"451":{"dur":1,"text":"Now I've actually\nbeen using this graph"},"453":{"dur":4,"text":"as a way of kind of getting\nthrough all my crazy thinking."},"457":{"dur":5,"text":"And my colleagues now call them\nmy crazy blue damn circles."},"462":{"dur":1,"text":"And I accept that."},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"It's mine."},"465":{"dur":0,"text":"I'll take it."},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"But that also means that editing\nin VR can't be frame to frame,"},"472":{"dur":1,"text":"right?"},"473":{"dur":4,"text":"So instead of frame to frame, we\nthink of it as world to world."},"477":{"dur":3,"text":"And now I can see the\npotential for everything,"},"481":{"dur":3,"text":"where the frame is everywhere."},"484":{"dur":1,"text":"Which is to say our\njobs as creators is not"},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"to preciously craft something\nthat someone may never"},"487":{"dur":1,"text":"look at and then\nforget the rest of it,"},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"but instead to guide visitors\nthrough a crafted universe."},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"And at the forefront\nof every new medium,"},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"we get the benefit of\ncoming up with terms."},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is one of those terms,\nprobabilistic experiential"},"502":{"dur":1,"text":"editing."},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"It has a really\nunfortunate acronym."},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"510":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, I can't do\nanything about that."},"514":{"dur":1,"text":"So let me explain\nwhat I mean by this."},"515":{"dur":2,"text":"Probabilistic experiential\nediting, at its core,"},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"is about understanding a\nvisitor's likely interaction"},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"with the world around them."},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"So first, let's get back\nto this idea of attention."},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"If I make a solid bet\non a particular POI,"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"like this glacier\nclimber, then I"},"532":{"dur":1,"text":"can make something\nor do something"},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"much like matching-- I call\nit matching on attention."},"537":{"dur":1,"text":"We do match on action\nin editing, too."},"539":{"dur":1,"text":"We cut to something\nelse that's moving."},"541":{"dur":1,"text":"With this, it's about\nattention, cutting"},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"from someone's attention\npoint to another thing"},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"that I may want them to see."},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"So taking something\nlike this where"},"549":{"dur":1,"text":"I can gauge where someone\nmight be, determine where"},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"our visitor's attention\nwill most likely land,"},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"and then align the following\nworld so that attention"},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"point matches with\nsomething else"},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"I'd want a visitor\nto pay attention to."},"561":{"dur":2,"text":"It could go from an attention\npoint to something else"},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"that I want a visitor\nto see, much like this."},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"Or it could just\nbe a spatial thing."},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"I just want you to feel\nspecially comfortable."},"574":{"dur":4,"text":"So keep things spatially similar\nto reinforce an engagement"},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"in a particular direction."},"582":{"dur":3,"text":"And the visitor rarely starts\nand ends at the same place."},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"If you do your job right,\nthey're looking around."},"588":{"dur":3,"text":"So as their attention\nshifts, our attention"},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"needs to shift with it."},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"And then you start to get\nthis kind of weird editing"},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"flow, kind of a\nbit like how we've"},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"thought about it in outpoints."},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"Except now it's not where I\nthink you should start and end."},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"It's me understanding where you\nwould like to start and end,"},"605":{"dur":1,"text":"and then responding to it."},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"And by doing this we start to\nlay the foundation of a pathway"},"609":{"dur":1,"text":"through the overall\nexperience, like creating"},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"a conversation or\na dance of sorts"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"with experiences of a visitor\nand the potential experiences"},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"of the worlds we create,\nkind of like unlocking"},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"an intricate cipher."},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"And I've been calling it,\nand consequently we've"},"623":{"dur":1,"text":"been calling it,\nthe hero's journey."},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is a potential journey\nwe can craft for a visitor."},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"There is no guarantee a\nvisitor is going to do this."},"630":{"dur":1,"text":"In fact, what's\nbeen really fun is"},"631":{"dur":1,"text":"when the visitor\nstarts doing that,"},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"and then goes away,\nand then comes back."},"635":{"dur":2,"text":"And I can see that based\nupon their orientation"},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"of how they're turning\nduring an experience, which"},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"is pretty cool."},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"And it gives the\nuniverse coherence."},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"It feels like it's all\npart of the same thing."},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"Even if someone's not\ngoing down that path,"},"649":{"dur":3,"text":"there is this vibe that\npeople feel like it's actually"},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"one long experience."},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's more to this,\nbut I can't go through it"},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"because it would take forever."},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"So consider this a primer."},"663":{"dur":3,"text":"So we as filmmakers consider\nthe camera to be this tool."},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"And we move a tool\naround a lot, and kind"},"668":{"dur":1,"text":"of frantically sometimes."},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"And we put in\nprecarious situations."},"672":{"dur":3,"text":"But in VR, whatever\nhappens to that rig"},"675":{"dur":1,"text":"happens to a human being."},"677":{"dur":1,"text":"So you can't just move the rig."},"678":{"dur":1,"text":"That's like OK,\nI'm like, I mean--"},"680":{"dur":1,"text":"that goes into a\nwhole other thing."},"682":{"dur":3,"text":"But if I'm standing\nand I'm looking out"},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"at a really beautiful\nthing, and then"},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"suddenly I get picked up\nand then put somewhere else,"},"690":{"dur":0,"text":"I would hate that."},"691":{"dur":1,"text":"Most people would hate that."},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"So we have to actually\nthink about what"},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"a human being will feel like\nif we do anything to that rig."},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"Like OK, I'm going to\ndo this to this rig."},"698":{"dur":3,"text":"How would I feel like if\nI had that happen to me?"},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"So a visitor doesn't show up\nwhen she puts on her headset."},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"She shows up as soon as you\npress the Record button."},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that's a really\nhuge thing that we"},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"need to accept as part of this."},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"So last year when we came back\nfrom a pretty intense film"},"713":{"dur":4,"text":"shoot, we drew up a\nvery high tech chart"},"717":{"dur":1,"text":"to analyze the\nimpact of everything"},"719":{"dur":3,"text":"we captured because we need some\nway to call down these shots."},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"I had to make it a little\nbit more PG rated because"},"725":{"dur":4,"text":"But you can see \"looks awesome,\"\n\"looks not so awesome\" there."},"730":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Sounds awesome,\" \"sounds\nnot so awesome\" there."},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"What we called the \"vortex\nof confusion\" where"},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"no one knows what's going on."},"739":{"dur":3,"text":"And then the \"I feel\nawesome\" or the impact."},"742":{"dur":3,"text":"And it turns out that horses\nis the experience to beat."},"748":{"dur":1,"text":"So what is \"I feel awesome\"?"},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"If the power of the frame\nis what we're after,"},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"and a frame is determined\nby where the visitor looks,"},"755":{"dur":1,"text":"then we need to\nchampion the visitor."},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"We need to care about how this\nexperience makes people feel."},"759":{"dur":0,"text":"So again, it gets complex."},"760":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's many ways to do it."},"761":{"dur":3,"text":"But for the sake of time,\nhere are three examples."},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"The first is having an identity."},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"A rig in a space is always\nregarded as something."},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"But when a person\nputs on a headset"},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"and they're in the\nspace, they expect"},"772":{"dur":2,"text":"to be regarded as someone."},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"So how do we do that?"},"777":{"dur":3,"text":"So the height of the rig,\nwhich we cannot see here,"},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"but imagine if you were a\nrig and you were my height,"},"784":{"dur":1,"text":"that would feel fine."},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"You relate to me."},"788":{"dur":1,"text":"Oh, this is fun."},"789":{"dur":3,"text":"But if we were a young kid--\nbut if I wanted to actually"},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"sit with you guys in\nthe audience right now,"},"794":{"dur":2,"text":"and I sat down, I would\nbe one of you versus me."},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think none of these work."},"799":{"dur":3,"text":"OK, let's just think about\nthis space right now."},"803":{"dur":1,"text":"If I was a rig and\nI wanted someone"},"805":{"dur":2,"text":"to be the presenter, which would\nbe terrifying because you can"},"807":{"dur":1,"text":"imagine being a presenter\nis pretty terrifying,"},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"I would actually have a rig\nhere at a level of mine."},"812":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's authoritative."},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"I look down on you guys and\nI'm like I'm the presenter."},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"But if I wanted the person\nthat is in the experience"},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"to feel like you, I would\nactually have the rig"},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"at your height, below."},"822":{"dur":1,"text":"And that actually\nmakes me relate"},"824":{"dur":1,"text":"to the audience instead of me."},"825":{"dur":1,"text":"Now granted, what\npeople end up doing is"},"827":{"dur":1,"text":"they'll put the rig here."},"828":{"dur":1,"text":"And the presenter will be here."},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"And the people will be here."},"831":{"dur":3,"text":"And then who the heck are you?"},"835":{"dur":0,"text":"Who am I?"},"836":{"dur":1,"text":"Like, I'm not the presenter\nbecause there's a presenter."},"837":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'm not you because\nI'm taller than you."},"839":{"dur":0,"text":"So what am I?"},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's a question you\nreally have to ask yourself."},"843":{"dur":1,"text":"We think of cameras\nas just capturing."},"844":{"dur":1,"text":"But if we're\ncapturing an identity,"},"845":{"dur":1,"text":"we really need to\nthink about what"},"847":{"dur":2,"text":"that identity is, what\nthe positioning is,"},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"what the height is."},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is actually a\nscene from something"},"855":{"dur":3,"text":"that released recently\nfor the Montreal Canadiens"},"858":{"dur":2,"text":"called \"Go Habs Go,\" which\nwe're really excited about."},"860":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a new Jump film."},"862":{"dur":3,"text":"And there was a moment\nthat I saw on this."},"865":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'm like OK, I know\nthat people are probably"},"867":{"dur":2,"text":"going to be looking at\nthe torch ceremony folks,"},"869":{"dur":1,"text":"so I got to put this in."},"870":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm going to talk about\neye contact for a second."},"873":{"dur":2,"text":"You can connect with someone\nin a very profound way"},"875":{"dur":1,"text":"through eye contact."},"876":{"dur":1,"text":"You probably shouldn't\ndo it all the time,"},"878":{"dur":1,"text":"because that makes you\nfeel kind of weird."},"879":{"dur":1,"text":"Like if someone kept\nkind of staring at you,"},"880":{"dur":1,"text":"would you feel cool with that?"},"882":{"dur":1,"text":"Probably not."},"883":{"dur":3,"text":"But if you nuance\nit and do it right,"},"887":{"dur":3,"text":"it actually ends up being\na really intimate moment."},"891":{"dur":2,"text":"It's basically a close-up."},"893":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's see it play here."},"897":{"dur":1,"text":"Oh, no."},"898":{"dur":1,"text":"Can we go back a slide?"},"899":{"dur":1,"text":"I really want people\nto see
