this."},"4346":{"dur":4,"text":"And so I think and Mark touched on many of these\npoints, again going back to the source document."},"4354":{"dur":5,"text":"We define a coin as a chain\nof digital signatures."},"4364":{"dur":1,"text":"Think about that, that's a bit of a mind bend."},"4366":{"dur":7,"text":"A lot of people think bitcoin and they start to\nthink oh it's like digital gold or they

property."},"4421":{"dur":3,"text":"You know that's very problematic because now\nyou don't have a clear record of ownership."},"4426":{"dur":3,"text":"Well the way bitcoin solves this\nproblem is in really two steps."},"4431":{"dur":4,"text":"First, is that the transactions\nmust be publicly announced."},"4438":{"dur":2,"text":"This I think was the real innovation."},"4442":{"dur":7,"text":"Rather than transactions being private and\nthen trying to secure that information,"},"4449":{"dur":1,"text":"which is what we do in our current system."},"4452":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's make it public, let's\nput it on the web itself."},"4457":{"dur":5,"text":"And so many people when they think about\ntransactions they think about security"},"4463":{"dur":3,"text":"in the sense of like let me put it on my\nserver and try and keep everybody else out."},"4468":{"dur":4,"text":"This is let's put it out there\npublicly so that everyone can see it."},"4473":{"dur":7,"text":"And then step two a system for\nparticipants to agree on a single history."},"4480":{"dur":6,"text":"And so if we want to verify these transactions\nwe need to have everyone agree on what"},"4487":{"dur":2,"text":"that history of those transactions are, okay."},"4490":{"dur":6,"text":"That's about the level I would\ndo with business school students."},"4496":{"dur":4,"text":"Our computer science department,\nmy colleagues Corin Pitcher,"},"4501":{"dur":5,"text":"Massimo DiPierro they're teaching this\nmore from the cryptographic perspective."},"4508":{"dur":3,"text":"Because cryptocurrency is\nultimately about cryptography."},"4513":{"dur":6,"text":"And so this peer to peer system is\na distributed time stamp server."},"4520":{"dur":8,"text":"Distributed public time stamp series of\ntransactions out there in this public space."},"4530":{"dur":4,"text":"And so the transfer of these coins\nis actually what's most important."},"4534":{"dur":5,"text":"Because you have a hashing, which is\na verification of those transactions"},"4540":{"dur":5,"text":"and you have public keys for the next owner\nrather than all of everything being private."},"4548":{"dur":10,"text":"Now I would argue that this approach\nis unique in that it is so public."},"4558":{"dur":8,"text":"And so this, the word blockchain does not appear\nin that white paper, but see this last quote,"},"4567":{"dur":4,"text":"nodes, which are these participants in the\nnetwork express their acceptance of a block"},"4572":{"dur":3,"text":"by working on creating the\nnext block in the chain."},"4576":{"dur":5,"text":"And so as these transactions are publicly\nannounced, as they're publicly verified,"},"4582":{"dur":5,"text":"the chain is
