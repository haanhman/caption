LITTLE EM'LY"},"3":{"dur":11,"text":"There was a servant in that house, a man who, I understood, was usually with Steerforth, and had come into his service at the University, who was in appearance a pattern of respectability."},"15":{"dur":4,"text":"I believe there never existed in his station a more respectable-looking man."},"19":{"dur":12,"text":"He was taciturn, soft-footed, very quiet in his manner, deferential, observant, always at hand when wanted, and never near when not wanted; but his great claim to consideration was his respectability."},"32":{"dur":8,"text":"He had not a pliant face, he had rather a stiff neck, rather a tight smooth head with short hair clinging to it at the sides, a soft way of speaking,"},"41":{"dur":10,"text":"with a peculiar habit of whispering the letter S so distinctly, that he seemed to use it oftener than any other man; but every peculiarity that he had he made respectable."},"51":{"dur":8,"text":"If his nose had been upside-down, he would have made that respectable. He surrounded himself with an atmosphere of respectability, and walked secure in it."},"60":{"dur":9,"text":"It would have been next to impossible to suspect him of anything wrong, he was so thoroughly respectable. Nobody could have thought of putting him in a livery, he was so highly respectable."},"70":{"dur":6,"text":"To have imposed any derogatory work upon him, would have been to inflict a wanton insult on the feelings of a most respectable man."},"77":{"dur":12,"text":"And of this, I noticed--the women-servants in the household were so intuitively conscious, that they always did such work themselves, and generally while he read the paper by the pantry fire."},"89":{"dur":8,"text":"Such a self-contained man I never saw. But in that quality, as in every other he possessed, he only seemed to be the more respectable."},"97":{"dur":9,"text":"Even the fact that no one knew his Christian name, seemed to form a part of his respectability. Nothing could be objected against his surname, Littimer, by which he was known."},"107":{"dur":6,"text":"Peter might have been hanged, or Tom transported; but Littimer was perfectly respectable."},"114":{"dur":8,"text":"It was occasioned, I suppose, by the reverend nature of respectability in the abstract, but I felt particularly young in this man's presence."},"123":{"dur":10,"text":"How old he was himself, I could not guess--and that again went to his credit on the same score; for in the calmness of respectability he might have numbered fifty years as well as thirty."},"133":{"dur":7,"text":"Littimer was in my room in the morning before I was up, to bring me that reproachful shaving-water, and to put out my clothes."},"140":{"dur":9,"text":"When I undrew the curtains and looked out of bed, I saw him, in an equable temperature of respectability, unaffected by the east wind of January, and not even breathing frostily,"},"150":{"dur":7,"text":"standing my boots right and left in the first dancing position, and blowing specks of dust off my coat as he laid it down like a baby."},"157":{"dur":3,"text":"I gave him good morning, and asked him what o'clock it was."},"161":{"dur":6,"text":"He took out of his pocket the most respectable hunting-watch I ever saw, and preventing the spring with his thumb from opening far,"},"168":{"dur":8,"text":"looked in at the face as if he were consulting an oracular oyster, shut it up again, and said, if I pleased, it was half past eight."},"176":{"dur":4,"text":"'Mr. Steerforth will be glad to hear how you have rested, sir.'"},"181":{"dur":5,"text":"'Thank you,' said I, 'very well indeed.

He had been doubtful at first whether to take Littimer or not, but decided to leave him at home."},"368":{"dur":7,"text":"The respectable creature, satisfied with his lot whatever it was, arranged our portmanteaux on the little carriage that was to take us into London,"},"376":{"dur":8,"text":"as if they were intended to defy the shocks of ages, and received my modestly proffered donation with perfect tranquillity."},"384":{"dur":7,"text":"We bade adieu to Mrs. Steerforth and Miss Dartle, with many thanks on my part, and much kindness on the devoted mother's."},"391":{"dur":7,"text":"The last thing I saw was Littimer's unruffled eye; fraught, as I fancied, with the silent conviction that I was very young indeed."},"398":{"dur":9,"text":"What I felt, in returning so auspiciously to the old familiar places, I shall not endeavour to describe. We went down by the Mail."},"408":{"dur":7,"text":"I was so concerned, I recollect, even for the honour of Yarmouth, that when Steerforth said, as we drove through its dark streets to the inn,"},"415":{"dur":7,"text":"that, as well as he could make out, it was a good, queer, out-of-the-way kind of hole, I was highly pleased."},"422":{"dur":9,"text":"We went to bed on our arrival (I observed a pair of dirty shoes and gaiters in connexion with my old friend the Dolphin as we passed that door), and breakfasted late in the morning."},"432":{"dur":9,"text":"Steerforth, who was in great spirits, had been strolling about the beach before I was up, and had made acquaintance, he said, with half the boatmen in the place."},"441":{"dur":7,"text":"Moreover, he had seen, in the distance, what he was sure must be the identical house of Mr. Peggotty, with smoke coming out of the chimney;"},"449":{"dur":6,"text":"and had had a great mind, he told me, to walk in and swear he was myself grown out of knowledge."},"456":{"dur":5,"text":"'When do you propose to introduce me there, Daisy?' he said. 'I am at your disposal. Make your own arrangements.'"},"461":{"dur":9,"text":"'Why, I was thinking that this evening would be a good time, Steerforth, when they are all sitting round the fire. I should like you to see it when it's snug, it's such a curious place.'"},"471":{"dur":3,"text":"'So be it!' returned Steerforth. 'This evening.'"},"475":{"dur":5,"text":"'I shall not give them any notice that we are here, you know,' said I, delighted. 'We must take them by surprise.'"},"481":{"dur":6,"text":"'Oh, of course! It's no fun,' said Steerforth, 'unless we take them by surprise. Let us see the natives in their aboriginal condition.'"},"488":{"dur":4,"text":"'Though they ARE that sort of people that you mentioned,' I returned."},"492":{"dur":7,"text":"'Aha! What! you recollect my skirmishes with Rosa, do you?' he exclaimed with a quick look. 'Confound the girl, I am half afraid of her."},"500":{"dur":6,"text":"She's like a goblin to me. But never mind her. Now what are you going to do? You are going to see your nurse, I suppose?'"},"507":{"dur":3,"text":"'Why, yes,' I said, 'I must see Peggotty first of all.'"},"510":{"dur":8,"text":"'Well,' replied Steerforth, looking at his watch. 'Suppose I deliver you up to be cried over for a couple of hours. Is that long enough?'"},"519":{"dur":5,"text":"I answered, laughing, that I thought we might get through it in that time, but that he must come also;"},"524":{"dur":5,"text":"for he would find that his renown had preceded him, and that he was almost as great a personage as I was."},"530":{"dur":10,"text":"'I'll come anywhere you like,' said Steerforth, 'or do anything you like. Tell me where to come to; and in two hours I'll produce myself in any state you please, sentimental or comical.'"},"540":{"dur":11,"text":"I gave him minute directions for finding the residence of Mr. Barkis, carrier to Blunderstone and elsewhere; and, on this understanding, went out alone."},"551":{"dur":11,"text":"There was a sharp bracing air; the ground was dry; the sea was crisp and clear; the sun was diffusing abundance of light, if not much warmth; and everything was fresh and lively."},"563":{"dur":8,"text":"I was so fresh and lively myself, in the pleasure of being there, that I could have stopped the people in the streets and shaken hands with them."},"571":{"dur":6,"text":"The streets looked small, of course. The streets that we have only seen as children always do, I believe, when we go back to them."},"577":{"dur":5,"text":"But I had forgotten nothing in them, and found nothing changed, until I came to Mr. Omer's shop."},"583":{"dur":11,"text":"OMER AND Joram was now written up, where OMER used to be; but the inscription, DRAPER, TAILOR, HABERDASHER, FUNERAL FURNISHER, &c., remained as it was."},"594":{"dur":8,"text":"My footsteps seemed to tend so naturally to the shop door, after I had read these words from over the way, that I went across the road and looked in."},"603":{"dur":7,"text":"There was a pretty woman at the back of the shop, dancing a little child in her arms, while another little fellow clung to her apron."},"610":{"dur":4,"text":"I had no difficulty in recognizing either Minnie or Minnie's children."},"614":{"dur":8,"text":"The glass door of the parlour was not open; but in the workshop across the yard I could faintly hear the old tune playing, as if it had never left off."},"622":{"dur":5,"text":"'Is Mr. Omer at home?' said I, entering. 'I should like to see him, for a moment, if he is.'"},"628":{"dur":8,"text":"'Oh yes, sir, he is at home,' said Minnie; 'the weather don't suit his asthma out of doors. Joe, call your grandfather!'"},"637":{"dur":9,"text":"The little fellow, who was holding her apron, gave such a lusty shout, that the sound of it made him bashful, and he buried his face in her skirts, to her great admiration."},"646":{"dur":9,"text":"I heard a heavy puffing and blowing coming towards us, and soon Mr. Omer, shorter-winded than of yore, but not much older-looking, stood before me."},"655":{"dur":9,"text":"'Servant, sir,' said Mr. Omer. 'What can I do for you, sir?' 'You can shake hands with me, Mr. Omer, if you please,' said I, putting out my own."},"665":{"dur":4,"text":"'You were very good-natured to me once, when I am afraid I didn't show that I thought so.'"},"670":{"dur":8,"text":"'Was I though?' returned the old man. 'I'm glad to hear it, but I don't remember when. Are you sure it was me?'"},"679":{"dur":7,"text":"'I think my memory has got as short as my breath,' said Mr. Omer, looking at me and shaking his head; 'for I don't remember you.'"},"687":{"dur":6,"text":"'Don't you remember your coming to the coach to meet me, and my having breakfast here, and our riding out to Blunderstone together:"},"694":{"dur":5,"text":"you, and I, and Mrs. Joram, and Mr. Joram too--who wasn't her husband then?'"},"699":{"dur":9,"text":"'Why, Lord bless my soul!' exclaimed Mr. Omer, after being thrown by his surprise into a fit of coughing, 'you don't say so!"},"709":{"dur":6,"text":"Minnie, my dear, you recollect? Dear me, yes; the party was a lady, I think?'"},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"'My mother,' I rejoined."},"718":{"dur":9,"text":"'To--be--sure,' said Mr. Omer, touching my waistcoat with his forefinger, 'and there was a little child too! There was two parties."},"728":{"dur":9,"text":"The little party was laid along with the other party. Over at Blunderstone it was, of course. Dear me! And how have you been since?'"},"737":{"dur":3,"text":"Very well, I thanked him, as I hoped he had been too."},"741":{"dur":8,"text":"'Oh! nothing to grumble at, you know,' said Mr. Omer. 'I find my breath gets short, but it seldom gets longer as a man gets older."},"749":{"dur":4,"text":"I take it as it comes, and make the most of it. That's the best way, ain't it?'"},"753":{"dur":9,"text":"Mr. Omer coughed again, in consequence of laughing, and was assisted out of his fit by his daughter, who now stood close beside us, dancing her smallest child on the counter."},"763":{"dur":9,"text":"'Dear me!' said Mr. Omer. 'Yes, to be sure. Two parties! Why, in that very ride, if you'll believe me, the day was named for my Minnie to marry Joram."},"773":{"dur":8,"text":"\"Do name it, sir,\" says Joram. \"Yes, do, father,\" says Minnie. And now he's come into the business. And look here! The youngest!'"},"781":{"dur":9,"text":"Minnie laughed, and stroked her banded hair upon her temples, as her father put one of his fat fingers into the hand of the child she was dancing on the counter."},"790":{"dur":7,"text":"'Two parties, of course!' said Mr. Omer, nodding his head retrospectively. 'Ex-actly so!"},"798":{"dur":11,"text":"And Joram's at work, at this minute, on a grey one with silver nails, not this measurement'--the measurement of the dancing child upon the counter--'by a good two inches.---Will you take something?'"},"810":{"dur":2,"text":"I thanked him, but declined."},"812":{"dur":12,"text":"'Let me see,' said Mr. Omer. 'Barkis's the carrier's wife--Peggotty's the boatman's sister--she had something to do with your family? She was in service there, sure?'"},"824":{"dur":3,"text":"My answering in the affirmative gave him great satisfaction."},"828":{"dur":5,"text":"'I believe my breath will get long next, my memory's getting so much so,' said Mr. Omer."},"833":{"dur":7,"text":"'Well, sir, we've got a young relation of hers here, under articles to us, that has as elegant a taste in the dress-making business--"},"841":{"dur":4,"text":"I assure you I don't believe there's a Duchess in England can touch her.'"},"845":{"dur":3,"text":"'Not little Em'ly?' said I, involuntarily."},"848":{"dur":11,"text":"'Em'ly's her name,' said Mr. Omer, 'and she's little too. But if you'll believe me, she has such a face of her own that half the women in this town are mad against her.'"},"860":{"dur":3,"text":"'Nonsense, father!' cried Minnie."},"863":{"dur":12,"text":"'My dear,' said Mr. Omer, 'I don't say it's the case with you,' winking at me, 'but I say that half the women in Yarmouth--ah! and in five mile round--are mad against that girl.'"},"875":{"dur":8,"text":"'Then she should have kept to her own station in life, father,' said Minnie, 'and not have given them any hold to talk about her, and then they couldn't have done it.'"},"883":{"dur":6,"text":"'Couldn't have done it, my dear!' retorted Mr. Omer. 'Couldn't have done it! Is that YOUR knowledge of life?"},"889":{"dur":7,"text":"What is there that any woman couldn't do, that she shouldn't do--especially on the subject of another woman's good looks?'"},"897":{"dur":5,"text":"I really thought it was all over with Mr. Omer, after he had uttered this libellous pleasantry."},"902":{"dur":9,"text":"He coughed to that extent, and his breath eluded all his attempts to recover it with that obstinacy, that I fully expected to see his head go down behind the counter, and his little black breeches,"},"912":{"dur":5,"text":"with the rusty little bunches of ribbons at the knees, come quivering up in a last ineffectual struggle."},"917":{"dur":7,"text":"At length, however, he got better, though he still panted hard, and was so exhausted that he was obliged to sit on the stool of the shop-desk."},"925":{"dur":9,"text":"'You see,' he said, wiping his head, and breathing with difficulty, 'she hasn't taken much to any companions here;"},"935":{"dur":6,"text":"she hasn't taken kindly to any particular acquaintances and friends, not to mention sweethearts."},"941":{"dur":5,"text":"In consequence, an ill-natured story got about, that Em'ly wanted to be a lady."},"947":{"dur":5,"text":"Now my opinion is, that it came into circulation principally on account of her sometimes saying, at the school,"},"953":{"dur":6,"text":"that if she was a lady she would like to do so-and-so for her uncle--don't you see?--and buy him such-and-such fine things.'"},"960":{"dur":6,"text":"'I assure you, Mr. Omer, she has said so to me,' I returned eagerly, 'when we were both children.'"},"966":{"dur":12,"text":"Mr. Omer nodded his head and rubbed his chin. 'Just so. Then out of a very little, she could dress herself, you see, better than most others could out of a deal, and that made things unpleasant."},"979":{"dur":7,"text":"Moreover, she was rather what might be called wayward--I'll go so far as to say what I should call wayward myself,' said Mr. Omer;"},"986":{"dur":7,"text":"'--didn't know her own mind quite--a little spoiled--and couldn't, at first, exactly bind herself down."},"993":{"dur":2,"text":"No more than that was ever said against her, Minnie?'"},"996":{"dur":4,"text":"'No, father,' said Mrs. Joram. 'That's the worst, I believe.'"},"1000":{"dur":13,"text":"'So when she got a situation,' said Mr. Omer, 'to keep a fractious old lady company, they didn't very well agree, and she didn't stop. At last she came here, apprenticed for three years."},"1013":{"dur":7,"text":"Nearly two of 'em are over, and she has been as good a girl as ever was. Worth any six! Minnie, is she worth any six, now?'"},"1020":{"dur":4,"text":"'Yes, father,' replied Minnie. 'Never say I detracted from her!'"},"1025":{"dur":2,"text":"'Very good,' said Mr. Omer. 'That's right."},"1028":{"dur":11,"text":"And so, young gentleman,' he added, after a few moments' further rubbing of his chin, 'that you may not consider me long-winded as well as short-breathed, I believe that's all about it.'"},"1039":{"dur":12,"text":"As they had spoken in a subdued tone, while speaking of Em'ly, I had no doubt that she was near. On my asking now, if that were not so, Mr. Omer nodded yes, and nodded towards the door of the parlour."},"1051":{"dur":7,"text":"My hurried inquiry if I might peep in, was answered with a free permission; and, looking through the glass, I saw her sitting at her work."},"1058":{"dur":6,"text":"I saw her, a most beautiful little creature, with the cloudless blue eyes, that had looked into my childish heart,"},"1065":{"dur":13,"text":"turned laughingly upon another child of Minnie's who was playing near her; with enough of wilfulness in her bright face to justify what I had heard; with much of the old capricious coyness lurking in it; but with nothing in her pretty looks,"},"1078":{"dur":7,"text":"I am sure, but what was meant for goodness and for happiness, and what was on a good and happy course."},"1085":{"dur":8,"text":"The tune across the yard that seemed as if it never had left off--alas! it was the tune that never DOES leave off--was beating, softly, all the while."},"1094":{"dur":8,"text":"'Wouldn't you like to step in,' said Mr. Omer, 'and speak to her? Walk in and speak to her, sir! Make yourself at home!'"},"1103":{"dur":9,"text":"I was too bashful to do so then--I was afraid of confusing her, and I was no less afraid of confusing myself.--but I informed myself of the hour at which she left of an evening,"},"1112":{"dur":10,"text":"in order that our visit might be timed accordingly; and taking leave of Mr. Omer, and his pretty daughter, and her little children, went away to my dear old Peggotty's."},"1122":{"dur":8,"text":"Here she was, in the tiled kitchen, cooking dinner! The moment I knocked at the door she opened it, and asked me what I pleased to want."},"1131":{"dur":8,"text":"I looked at her with a smile, but she gave me no smile in return. I had never ceased to write to her, but it must have been seven years since we had met."},"1139":{"dur":5,"text":"'Is Mr. Barkis at home, ma'am?' I said, feigning to speak roughly to her."},"1145":{"dur":4,"text":"'He's at home, sir,' returned Peggotty, 'but he's bad abed with the rheumatics.'"},"1150":{"dur":4,"text":"'Don't he go over to Blunderstone now?' I asked."},"1154":{"dur":2,"text":"'When he's well he do,' she answered."},"1157":{"dur":3,"text":"'Do YOU ever go there, Mrs. Barkis?'"},"1160":{"dur":5,"text":"She looked at me more attentively, and I noticed a quick movement of her hands towards each other."},"1166":{"dur":7,"text":"'Because I want to ask a question about a house there, that they call the--what is it?--the Rookery,' said I."},"1173":{"dur":6,"text":"She took a step backward, and put out her hands in an undecided frightened way, as if to keep me off."},"1180":{"dur":2,"text":"'Peggotty!' I cried to her."},"1182":{"dur":7,"text":"She cried, 'My darling boy!' and we both burst into tears, and were locked in one another's arms."},"1190":{"dur":6,"text":"What extravagances she committed; what laughing and crying over me; what pride she showed, what joy,"},"1196":{"dur":7,"text":"what sorrow that she whose pride and joy I might have been, could never hold me in a fond embrace; I have not the heart to tell."},"1204":{"dur":11,"text":"I was troubled with no misgiving that it was young in me to respond to her emotions. I had never laughed and cried in all my life, I dare say--not even to her--more freely than I did that morning."},"1216":{"dur":7,"text":"'Barkis will be so glad,' said Peggotty, wiping her eyes with her apron, 'that it'll do him more good than pints of liniment."},"1223":{"dur":3,"text":"May I go and tell him you are here? Will you come up and see him, my dear?'"},"1227":{"dur":1,"text":"Of course I would."},"1229":{"dur":5,"text":"But Peggotty could not get out of the room as easily as she meant to, for as often as she got to the door and looked round at me,"},"1234":{"dur":4,"text":"she came back again to have another laugh and another cry upon my shoulder."},"1239":{"dur":11,"text":"At last, to make the matter easier, I went upstairs with her; and having waited outside for a minute, while she said a word of preparation to Mr. Barkis, presented myself before that invalid."},"1250":{"dur":10,"text":"He received me with absolute enthusiasm. He was too rheumatic to be shaken hands with, but he begged me to shake the tassel on the top of his nightcap, which I did most cordially."},"1260":{"dur":8,"text":"When I sat down by the side of the bed, he said that it did him a world of good to feel as if he was driving me on the Blunderstone road again."},"1269":{"dur":10,"text":"As he lay in bed, face upward, and so covered, with that exception, that he seemed to be nothing but a face--like a conventional cherubim--he looked the queerest object I ever beheld."},"1279":{"dur":6,"text":"'What name was it, as I wrote up in the cart, sir?' said Mr. Barkis, with a slow rheumatic smile."},"1286":{"dur":4,"text":"'Ah! Mr. Barkis, we had some grave talks about that matter, hadn't we?'"},"1290":{"dur":3,"text":"'I was willin' a long time, sir?' said Mr. Barkis."},"1294":{"dur":2,"text":"'A long time,' said I."},"1296":{"dur":9,"text":"'And I don't regret it,' said Mr. Barkis. 'Do you remember what you told me once, about her making all the apple parsties and doing all the cooking?'"},"1305":{"dur":2,"text":"'Yes, very well,' I returned."},"1308":{"dur":13,"text":"'It was as true,' said Mr. Barkis, 'as turnips is. It was as true,' said Mr. Barkis, nodding his nightcap, which was his only means of emphasis, 'as taxes is. And nothing's truer than them.'"},"1322":{"dur":6,"text":"Mr. Barkis turned his eyes upon me, as if for my assent to this result of his reflections in bed; and I gave it."},"1329":{"dur":9,"text":"'Nothing's truer than them,' repeated Mr. Barkis; 'a man as poor as I am, finds that out in his mind when he's laid up. I'm a very poor man, sir!'"},"1339":{"dur":2,"text":"'I am sorry to hear it, Mr. Barkis.'"},"1342":{"dur":4,"text":"'A very poor man, indeed I am,' said Mr. Barkis."},"1347":{"dur":10,"text":"Here his right hand came slowly and feebly from under the bedclothes, and with a purposeless uncertain grasp took hold of a stick which was loosely tied to the side of the bed."},"1357":{"dur":6,"text":"After some poking about with this instrument, in the course of which his face assumed a variety of distracted expressions,"},"1364":{"dur":5,"text":"Mr. Barkis poked it against a box, an end of which had been visible to me all the time."},"1369":{"dur":2,"text":"Then his face became composed."},"1371":{"dur":3,"text":"'Old clothes,' said Mr. Barkis."},"1375":{"dur":1,"text":"'Oh!' said I."},"1376":{"dur":4,"text":"'I wish it was Money, sir,' said Mr. Barkis."},"1381":{"dur":3,"text":"'I wish it was, indeed,' said I."},"1384":{"dur":5,"text":"'But it AIN'T,' said Mr. Barkis, opening both his eyes as wide as he possibly could."},"1389":{"dur":6,"text":"I expressed myself quite sure of that, and Mr. Barkis, turning his eyes more gently to his wife, said:"},"1396":{"dur":8,"text":"'She's the usefullest and best of women, C.
