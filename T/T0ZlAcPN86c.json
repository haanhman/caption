longer"},"20":{"dur":3,"text":"before you guys get some beers."},"23":{"dur":3,"text":"But for now, you're\nstuck with me."},"27":{"dur":2,"text":"So a quick show of hands,\nhow many developers have we"},"29":{"dur":1,"text":"got in the room?"},"31":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, we're going to have\nsome code samples for you,"},"34":{"dur":2,"text":"so hopefully that will\nkeep you entertained."},"36":{"dur":4,"text":"So whether you're an ISV, so\nan independent software vendor,"},"41":{"dur":4,"text":"or an enterprise developer\nor a development

enterprise."},"54":{"dur":4,"text":"First of all though, why\nare we investing in mobile?"},"58":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, mobile is now\nbecoming a significant part"},"62":{"dur":4,"text":"of most enterprises'\ndigital strategies."},"66":{"dur":3,"text":"And let's actually look at\nsome data as to why is mobile"},"70":{"dur":1,"text":"so important."},"71":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, first of all, it's about\nincreasing sales and revenue."},"77":{"dur":3,"text":"It's about improving\nemployee productivity,"},"81":{"dur":2,"text":"and then decreasing costs."},"83":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's many other\nreasons for it as well,"},"86":{"dur":3,"text":"but those are really\nsome of the top ones."},"89":{"dur":2,"text":"Then in terms of\nAndroid, Android"},"91":{"dur":3,"text":"is the biggest\noperating system in"},"95":{"dur":4,"text":"mobile across smartphone\ndevices today."},"99":{"dur":2,"text":"And that extends\ninto enterprise."},"101":{"dur":5,"text":"68% of mobile devices shipped\nthrough an enterprise channel"},"107":{"dur":3,"text":"were Android last year."},"110":{"dur":4,"text":"And Android has a huge range\nof devices that it works on,"},"115":{"dur":7,"text":"so everything from a smartwatch\nto smartphones, tablets."},"122":{"dur":2,"text":"And then recently\nlast year we've"},"124":{"dur":3,"text":"announced Android apps\nrunning on Chrome OS."},"127":{"dur":3,"text":"So you've now got Android\napps running on laptop devices"},"131":{"dur":3,"text":"and on large screen devices."},"134":{"dur":4,"text":"So Chrome OS version 53 and\nbeyond on selected models,"},"139":{"dur":3,"text":"and then all Chrome OS devices\nlaunched from this year onwards"},"143":{"dur":2,"text":"will be able to\nsupport Android apps."},"145":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you're thinking about\ndeveloping on Android,"},"148":{"dur":3,"text":"this is a really good time."},"152":{"dur":4,"text":"So let's also have a look at\nthe nature of mobile apps."},"156":{"dur":7,"text":"Well, although hybrid-type apps\nand web-type apps on mobile"},"163":{"dur":2,"text":"are inherently\ncross-platform, actually"},"166":{"dur":1,"text":"what we see in\nenterprises is they"},"168":{"dur":3,"text":"continue to develop\non the native platform"},"171":{"dur":4,"text":"itself, even though most\nenterprises are cross-platform"},"176":{"dur":0,"text":"in their nature."},"177":{"dur":2,"text":"So they have employees\nthat are using"},"179":{"dur":2,"text":"iOS as well as Android devices."},"182":{"dur":2,"text":"So we are really going to focus\nhere on native Android app"},"185":{"dur":2,"text":"development."},"187":{"dur":3,"text":"And then in terms of how do\nthose Android apps actually"},"190":{"dur":2,"text":"interact with other\nservices, well,"},"192":{"dur":2,"text":"when we surveyed\ndevelopers, we found"},"195":{"dur":5,"text":"that the vast majority, well\nover 90% of Android apps,"},"200":{"dur":3,"text":"are actually part of a\nbigger software solution."},"204":{"dur":4,"text":"So they are communicating\nwith a cloud back end."},"208":{"dur":3,"text":"So we're going to assume for the\npurposes of this presentation"},"212":{"dur":4,"text":"that that's going to\nbe the architecture."},"216":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's just structure\nthis session briefly."},"219":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're going to talk\nin three sections."},"222":{"dur":1,"text":"First of all we're\ngoing to focus"},"223":{"dur":2,"text":"on some aspects of design."},"225":{"dur":3,"text":"Then we're going to talk about\nbuilding Android apps, and then"},"229":{"dur":4,"text":"finally deploying those\napps out to enterprises."},"234":{"dur":3,"text":"We're going to talk about\nsome critical best practices."},"237":{"dur":6,"text":"And a lot of these have got\nmuch more detailed documentation"},"244":{"dur":1,"text":"available on the web."},"245":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going to show\na bunch of QR codes"},"247":{"dur":1,"text":"in the corners of the slides."},"249":{"dur":2,"text":"You can then use those to\nlook up that documentation."},"252":{"dur":2,"text":"Some of them are\nthings like video links"},"254":{"dur":2,"text":"which you can go and have\na look at when you're back"},"256":{"dur":0,"text":"in the office."},"260":{"dur":3,"text":"So first of all, let's\ntalk about design."},"264":{"dur":4,"text":"Why does it matter you\nspend time on design?"},"268":{"dur":2,"text":"From an enterprise\nperspective, it's"},"271":{"dur":2,"text":"about cost of your operations."},"273":{"dur":3,"text":"Huh, what you mean cost?"},"276":{"dur":8,"text":"Well, we've seen that mobile is\nabout increasing productivity."},"284":{"dur":2,"text":"And if that's the main reason\nthat you're rolling out"},"287":{"dur":3,"text":"your apps and\nservices to mobile,"},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"then there's a few things\nthat we need to think about."},"293":{"dur":2,"text":"Those apps need to be\nquick for the employees"},"296":{"dur":3,"text":"to use, which means\nthe lower time cost."},"299":{"dur":3,"text":"They've got to be easy to use\nas well so that you don't need"},"302":{"dur":3,"text":"to have support\nor lower support,"},"306":{"dur":2,"text":"and minimal training required--"},"308":{"dur":2,"text":"again, lower time cost."},"311":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you don't carefully\ninvest in design"},"315":{"dur":1,"text":"when you're building\nyour app, you"},"317":{"dur":3,"text":"can actually risk missing out\non some of the key benefits"},"321":{"dur":1,"text":"that you set out to\nwhen you originally"},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"decided to go mobile."},"326":{"dur":4,"text":"So how can mobile really\nbenefit your users?"},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"We're going to\nfocus, first of all,"},"332":{"dur":4,"text":"on how you can use all of the\nsensors and peripherals that"},"337":{"dur":4,"text":"are built into modern\nmobile devices."},"341":{"dur":5,"text":"Because those are really going\nto help your users quickly"},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"get information into\napps rather than having"},"349":{"dur":3,"text":"to type everything manually."},"352":{"dur":4,"text":"So mobile devices have a wealth\nof sensors and peripherals."},"356":{"dur":3,"text":"You've got cellular\nconnectivity as well as Wi-Fi."},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"You've got GPS location."},"363":{"dur":3,"text":"You've got motion sensors\nlike a gyro and accelerometer."},"366":{"dur":5,"text":"You've got proximity\nNFC for swiping badges,"},"371":{"dur":3,"text":"Bluetooth for local\nconnectivity, but also"},"375":{"dur":3,"text":"potentially indoor location\nusing Bluetooth beacons,"},"379":{"dur":5,"text":"cameras for QR codes,\naugmented reality, microphones"},"384":{"dur":3,"text":"for things like\nvoice recognition,"},"388":{"dur":3,"text":"a flashlight or torch, depending\non which side of the pond"},"391":{"dur":5,"text":"you're from, for providing\nlight and then fingerprints,"},"396":{"dur":3,"text":"which make your security\nworkflows, your sign"},"400":{"dur":3,"text":"in workflow much slicker."},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"So let's just look\nat a few examples"},"405":{"dur":4,"text":"to illustrate some\nopportunities here."},"409":{"dur":5,"text":"Sometimes it's some really\nvery simple things that help."},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"In this example,\nBritish Gas have"},"417":{"dur":3,"text":"added just a light function\nto their meter reading app."},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"What they realized\nwas gas meters"},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"are often in dark places."},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"And having that\nlight quickly to hand"},"427":{"dur":4,"text":"when they're entering in\nthe meter reading actually"},"432":{"dur":2,"text":"made it much quicker\nto read a meter."},"435":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's just look\nquickly at the code here."},"439":{"dur":3,"text":"So the light on a\nsmartphone is actually"},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"part of the camera module."},"445":{"dur":4,"text":"And there are multiple camera\nmodules on many smart devices."},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"So you need to then\niterate through those"},"451":{"dur":4,"text":"and identify, well, which is the\ncamera module that the light is"},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"associated with, and\nthen switch that on,"},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"and then returning the state\nback to the calling method"},"461":{"dur":5,"text":"so it knows that I've found\nthe light to switch on."},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"You could also be a little bit\nmore ambitious with something"},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"like augmented reality."},"472":{"dur":3,"text":"So here's an example\nfrom the marine industry,"},"475":{"dur":4,"text":"helping mariners add\nimportant information"},"480":{"dur":3,"text":"about local shipping."},"483":{"dur":3,"text":"So to get started with\naugmenting reality,"},"487":{"dur":4,"text":"one of the things that you\nneed is a fixed reference point"},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"in order to match the image\noverlay with the image"},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"that you're getting\nfrom the camera."},"498":{"dur":3,"text":"There's a really, really\ngood reference point,"},"502":{"dur":1,"text":"which is gravity."},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"Gravity is always pointing down."},"506":{"dur":4,"text":"And conveniently,\nAndroid provides a sensor"},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"for the gravity vector."},"512":{"dur":4,"text":"So you can look at or\nyou can get the gravity"},"517":{"dur":3,"text":"sensor from the sensor\nservice within Android,"},"520":{"dur":3,"text":"create a callback\nmethod which then,"},"523":{"dur":4,"text":"for each update of that gravity\nvector that the sensor is"},"527":{"dur":3,"text":"taking, you can\nextract that vector"},"530":{"dur":4,"text":"and then use that to update\nyour overlay over the image"},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"that your camera is taking."},"537":{"dur":5,"text":"And then of course we need to\nenable that callback method"},"543":{"dur":4,"text":"by registering it as a listener\nfor updates from the gravity"},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"sensor."},"549":{"dur":1,"text":"And then finally\nI want to give you"},"551":{"dur":3,"text":"an example of an\ninternal app from Google"},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"called Google Fixit."},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"Fixit is used by\nGooglers in order"},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"to report problems\nwith our building"},"562":{"dur":5,"text":"facilities and IT equipment\nthat's around our buildings."},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"As you can see from\nthis screenshot,"},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"before I've even\nentered a location,"},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"it already knows that\nI'm on the 10th floor"},"576":{"dur":3,"text":"of the building I was in\nwhen I took the screenshot."},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"And when I then start\nto enter the exact room,"},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"it will autocomplete for me."},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"So there's three things\nthat we really need"},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"to get that kind of experience."},"591":{"dur":3,"text":"Number one is get the location."},"594":{"dur":3,"text":"Secondly is to look up against\na series of points of interest"},"598":{"dur":3,"text":"that might be interesting\nin your application,"},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"and then of course\ndo the autocomplete."},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going to focus specifically\non the location piece"},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"because that's the mobile bit."},"609":{"dur":4,"text":"The rest you'll probably\nalready be doing in the cloud."},"613":{"dur":3,"text":"So on the location side, there's\nreally two techniques for this."},"617":{"dur":5,"text":"Android already keeps a\nregular poll of your location."},"623":{"dur":5,"text":"So you can just look up the last\nknown location of the device."},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"But that's sometimes\nnot entirely accurate"},"630":{"dur":3,"text":"because it only does that with\na relatively low frequency"},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"in order to conserve\nbattery life."},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"But it might be useful\nif you know your user has"},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"been stationary for a while."},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"It's also very quick because\nthat location is already"},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"stored in memory."},"646":{"dur":3,"text":"The second approach\nis then to start"},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"listening for location updates."},"652":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is then activating a\nparticular location provider."},"657":{"dur":3,"text":"In this example, I've got GPS."},"660":{"dur":1,"text":"And as you probably\nknow, it takes"},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"a little while for a GPS\nchipset to actually acquire"},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"a good fix of satellites."},"667":{"dur":4,"text":"So you can start\nsampling location updates"},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"and then provide\nthose location updates"},"674":{"dur":5,"text":"to a short method, which can\nthen determine for you which"},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"is the most accurate take."},"681":{"dur":3,"text":"So for this particular\nexample, one way"},"685":{"dur":4,"text":"to get a combination of accuracy\nand a good user experience"},"689":{"dur":4,"text":"is as soon as the user first\nclicks into the autocompleting"},"694":{"dur":7,"text":"text field is to first call the\nget last known location method."},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"So you can get\nsomething quickly,"},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"responsively for the\nuser to start typing,"},"706":{"dur":6,"text":"but at the same time start\nsampling for a new, more"},"713":{"dur":1,"text":"accurate location."},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"And as your user\nis typing, you're"},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"anyway updating your\nautocomplete list."},"719":{"dur":4,"text":"You can also be using an\nupdated location in parallel"},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"in order to refine that list,\nand therefore minimizing"},"726":{"dur":3,"text":"the amount of time that\nyour user needs to spend"},"729":{"dur":4,"text":"when entering this information."},"734":{"dur":1,"text":"So we're going to change\ngears now and talk"},"735":{"dur":4,"text":"about some techniques\nfor building your app."},"740":{"dur":4,"text":"The first one, of\ncourse, is security."},"744":{"dur":4,"text":"So I could probably spend\nmost of today talking"},"748":{"dur":1,"text":"about security on Android."},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"And there has already\nbeen a number of talks"},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"about that this week."},"755":{"dur":2,"text":"But let's just structure this,\nand then we can focus down"},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"on a particular area."},"760":{"dur":3,"text":"So I've got three\nareas here-- first"},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"of all, platform security."},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"We harden the Android platform\nagainst direct attack."},"769":{"dur":4,"text":"Ecosystem security-- we're\nproviding security updates"},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"for device OEMs."},"777":{"dur":3,"text":"We're also putting in\na lot of app scanning"},"781":{"dur":3,"text":"and other tools\nwithin Google Play"},"784":{"dur":3,"text":"to make sure our users are\nconfident that apps that they"},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"are installing are safe."},"789":{"dur":5,"text":"And then finally, the apps\nthemselves, your apps,"},"795":{"dur":3,"text":"need to be themselves\nfree from vulnerabilities."},"798":{"dur":4,"text":"So Adrian Ludwig, our\nsecurity director for Android,"},"802":{"dur":1,"text":"spoke yesterday."},"803":{"dur":2,"text":"And he really focused\non numbers one and two."},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm going to focus\nhere on some techniques"},"808":{"dur":2,"text":"that you should think\nabout in number three,"},"810":{"dur":2,"text":"really making sure\nthat your apps are"},"813":{"dur":3,"text":"free from vulnerabilities."},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"So the top three things--"},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"if there's just three\nthings you think"},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"about when securing\nyour app, these"},"824":{"dur":1,"text":"are the three that\nwe recommend--"},"826":{"dur":4,"text":"firstly, making sure you're\nusing only secure network"},"830":{"dur":4,"text":"protocols; secondly, using the\ndefault local storage that's"},"835":{"dur":4,"text":"provided by Android; and\nthen thirdly, checking that"},"839":{"dur":3,"text":"the device is authentic\nand uncompromised"},"843":{"dur":1,"text":"when you're running on it."},"844":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a full list\nactually at this QR code"},"847":{"dur":3,"text":"here with extensive\ndetails about how"},"850":{"dur":2,"text":"to further secure your apps."},"853":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's just go into a\nfew more details though."},"857":{"dur":3,"text":"It might be stating the obvious,\nbut we see this time and time"},"860":{"dur":2,"text":"again that apps are\nstill communicating"},"863":{"dur":3,"text":"to their back ends\nin clear text."},"867":{"dur":1,"text":"So let's just reiterate this."},"869":{"dur":4,"text":"Securing and encrypting\nyour app's communications"},"873":{"dur":4,"text":"to its back end is absolutely\ncritical in protecting data"},"877":{"dur":1,"text":"in transit."},"879":{"dur":2,"text":"The most effective\nway of doing this"},"881":{"dur":3,"text":"is to tell Android to stop\nyour app from actually"},"885":{"dur":2,"text":"using clear text protocols."},"887":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can do that in\nyour app's manifest."},"889":{"dur":4,"text":"You can simply set up a\nnetwork security configuration"},"893":{"dur":5,"text":"to ensure that cleartext\ntraffic is not permitted."},"899":{"dur":1,"text":"This is particularly\nimportant when"},"901":{"dur":2,"text":"you're using third party SDKs."},"903":{"dur":2,"text":"You can set up development\nprocesses internally"},"906":{"dur":4,"text":"to make sure that you\nare yourselves writing"},"911":{"dur":2,"text":"SSL-based communications."},"914":{"dur":2,"text":"But if you're using third\nparty SDKs that might also"},"917":{"dur":3,"text":"be communicating to\nsome back end, enforcing"},"920":{"dur":2,"text":"this here will mean\nthat those SDKs also"},"923":{"dur":3,"text":"can't use cleartext protocols."},"926":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're using\nFirebase for your app,"},"928":{"dur":2,"text":"then that already uses\nsecure protocols back"},"931":{"dur":4,"text":"to Google's back end."},"935":{"dur":3,"text":"While on the subject\nof secure protocols,"},"939":{"dur":3,"text":"you should also be aware\nthat many enterprises"},"943":{"dur":7,"text":"use content proxying as another\nmeasure to secure their data."},"950":{"dur":2,"text":"The way that works is\nthat the enterprise"},"953":{"dur":4,"text":"would deploy a SSL certificate,\na custom certificate,"},"957":{"dur":5,"text":"on the device, and use\nthat for the SSL encryption"},"962":{"dur":1,"text":"to the proxy."},"963":{"dur":1,"text":"And then the proxy back\nto the service back end"},"965":{"dur":4,"text":"would then use the\nservice's own certificate."},"970":{"dur":2,"text":"So in that case,\nyou're effectively"},"972":{"dur":4,"text":"man in the middling\nyour own app."},"977":{"dur":7,"text":"Since Android Nougat, we've\nmade some security changes such"},"985":{"dur":4,"text":"that Android actually ignores\nthose custom certificates"},"989":{"dur":5,"text":"and lets an app\nexplicitly opt in."},"995":{"dur":2,"text":"So here you have, in\nthe manifest then,"},"998":{"dur":3,"text":"a way to actually\nopt in for that."},"1001":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're a development\nagency or you're"},"1003":{"dur":2,"text":"an internal\nenterprise developer,"},"1006":{"dur":2,"text":"then actually finding\nthe list of domains"},"1008":{"dur":3,"text":"that you need to whitelist\nis probably straightforward,"},"1012":{"dur":2,"text":"and that list is\nrelatively small."},"1014":{"dur":3,"text":"So you can set up a\nwhitelist a lot like this."},"1017":{"dur":6,"text":"If you're an ISV and potentially\nusing or distributing your app"},"1024":{"dur":3,"text":"to many customers, then\nthat list of domains"},"1027":{"dur":1,"text":"is going to be very, very long."},"1028":{"dur":5,"text":"So you should consider\nenabling that for all domains."},"1034":{"dur":3,"text":"And you can set that\nas a base configuration"},"1038":{"dur":3,"text":"within your network\nsecurity policy."},"1041":{"dur":3,"text":"Obviously that opens\nthings up a little bit."},"1045":{"dur":2,"text":"So the way the\nenterprise can then"},"1047":{"dur":6,"text":"resecure that to make sure\nthat we haven't introduced"},"1053":{"dur":3,"text":"any additional\nsecurity holes there"},"1057":{"dur":2,"text":"is to use device\nmanagement where"},"1059":{"dur":3,"text":"they can restrict and manage\nwhich certificates are actually"},"1062":{"dur":0,"text":"deployed to the device."},"1066":{"dur":4,"text":"So let's move on now to\ndata storage on the device"},"1071":{"dur":4,"text":"so Android uses a sandbox\nexecution environment such"},"1075":{"dur":2,"text":"that all of an\napp's data is only"},"1078":{"dur":5,"text":"available to that app itself\nunless it's explicitly shared."},"1083":{"dur":3,"text":"Also from Marshmallow\nonwards, we've"},"1086":{"dur":3,"text":"required the device\nstorage encryption"},"1090":{"dur":2,"text":"to be implemented as standard."},"1093":{"dur":3,"text":"And if the device is managed by\nan enterprise mobility manager"},"1096":{"dur":2,"text":"or device management\nsystem, then that actually"},"1099":{"dur":3,"text":"might being required by policy."},"1103":{"dur":3,"text":"Also in Android\nNougat and beyond,"},"1107":{"dur":3,"text":"we can also use\nseparate encryption keys"},"1110":{"dur":3,"text":"for work data versus\npersonal data in storage."},"1114":{"dur":1,"text":"And we're going\nto talk about data"},"1115":{"dur":3,"text":"separation in a little bit."},"1119":{"dur":3,"text":"On external storage\nthen, external storage"},"1122":{"dur":2,"text":"is globally readable\nand writable."},"1124":{"dur":3,"text":"It's not part of that sandbox\nexecution environment."},"1128":{"dur":3,"text":"So you really shouldn't store\nany sensitive information"},"1132":{"dur":2,"text":"in that area."},"1134":{"dur":3,"text":"Also an administrator might\nset policies to actually block"},"1138":{"dur":2,"text":"the use of external storage."},"1140":{"dur":2,"text":"So you should certainly\nhave a fallback position"},"1142":{"dur":3,"text":"if you do need to use that."},"1146":{"dur":2,"text":"Also if you do\nneed to use it, do"},"1148":{"dur":3,"text":"make sure you perform input\nvalidation when reading back"},"1151":{"dur":2,"text":"from that external\nstorage as you"},"1154":{"dur":3,"text":"would for any other\nuntrusted source of data."},"1160":{"dur":3,"text":"And then finally,\nhow do you know"},"1164":{"dur":2,"text":"that the device that\nyour app is running on"},"1167":{"dur":3,"text":"is not vulnerable\nor compromised?"},"1170":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, the SafetyNet\nAttest API, which"},"1172":{"dur":3,"text":"is part of Google's\nmobile services,"},"1176":{"dur":2,"text":"provides that capability."},"1179":{"dur":3,"text":"It examines the software\nand hardware information"},"1182":{"dur":4,"text":"about the device that\nyou're running on,"},"1186":{"dur":3,"text":"and it attempts to match\nthat software and hardware"},"1190":{"dur":4,"text":"fingerprint against a\nset of known fingerprints"},"1194":{"dur":3,"text":"that Google maintains."},"1197":{"dur":3,"text":"It does basic device\nintegrity checking,"},"1200":{"dur":6,"text":"and it also can

apps--"},"2700":{"dur":2,"text":"for example, the\nconsumer Play Store--"},"2703":{"dur":3,"text":"which is there which is allowing\nthe user to install apps"},"2706":{"dur":2,"text":"in an uncontrolled way."},"2709":{"dur":5,"text":"So we've introduced management\ncapabilities within Google Play"},"2714":{"dur":5,"text":"to provide an enterprise\napp store for users."},"2720":{"dur":3,"text":"IT administrators are\nable to curate the app"},"2723":{"dur":2,"text":"store for their\nusers, laying out"},"2726":{"dur":3,"text":"those apps into\nclusters and

think,"},"2760":{"dur":1,"text":"during this conference."},"2762":{"dur":3,"text":"But this is really the\ncritical part of it."},"2765":{"dur":4,"text":"Google Play is a secure\nsource of

else?"},"2824":{"dur":4,"text":"Well Google Play as a platform\nhas a number of big benefits."},"2828":{"dur":1,"text":"Firstly, it's secure."},"2830":{"dur":3,"text":"We're using strong\nauthentication"},"2833":{"dur":3,"text":"with encrypted delivery of\nthose apps down to your device."},"2836":{"dur":1,"text":"And those apps are all signed."},"2838":{"dur":5,"text":"And we're making sure\nthat any updates of apps"},"2844":{"dur":4,"text":"are signed by the same key\nas the original app itself."},"2848":{"dur":2,"text":"We have a global\nserver footprint."},"2851":{"dur":3,"text":"Urs talked a lot about\nthat this morning."},"2854":{"dur":4,"text":"We use patch updates rather\nthan sending the whole APK down"},"2859":{"dur":1,"text":"for every update."},"2860":{"dur":1,"text":"We only send down\nthe differences"},"2862":{"dur":1,"text":"in a compressed format."},"2864":{"dur":4,"text":"That significantly reduces\nbandwidth requirement
