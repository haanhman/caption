{"7":{"dur":4,"text":"Tansi.\nWelcome to our second topic of the course,"},"11":{"dur":2,"text":"the history of Indigenous education."},"14":{"dur":4,"text":"In topic two, I will address the history of Indigenous education,"},"18":{"dur":3,"text":"speaking specifically to the Canadian context."},"21":{"dur":4,"text":"So while I'll speak of Canada's history of Aboriginal education,"},"25":{"dur":3,"text":"this history is very similar to those of Native American peoples"},"29":{"dur":3,"text":"in the United States, Aboriginal and Torres Island Strait"},"33":{"dur":2,"text":"history of education in Australia."},"36":{"dur":3,"text":"And some of the features I will discuss within certain phases of education"},"40":{"dur":3,"text":"are certainly familiar within traditional approaches"},"43":{"dur":2,"text":"to Maori education."},"45":{"dur":3,"text":"This topic is intended to provide a historical backdrop"},"48":{"dur":4,"text":"important to understanding what Indigenous peoples want and value"},"52":{"dur":4,"text":"in education, as well as an introduction to the colonial history of schooling"},"57":{"dur":3,"text":"relevant to the processes of reconciliation"},"60":{"dur":2,"text":"that we want to achieve in this course."},"63":{"dur":5,"text":"The content of this topic focuses on the significant colonial experiences"},"68":{"dur":2,"text":"of residential schools in Canada."},"71":{"dur":3,"text":"These institutions were a dominating force of assimilation."},"75":{"dur":2,"text":"And, as some argue, the goal of these schools"},"78":{"dur":5,"text":"were to really eliminate Indigenous peoples from emerging settler societies"},"83":{"dur":2,"text":"in North America and certainly Australia."},"86":{"dur":2,"text":"A further goal of the topic is to introduce you"},"89":{"dur":3,"text":"to a set of strategies and resources for teaching"},"92":{"dur":2,"text":"this history in the curriculum of schools"},"94":{"dur":3,"text":"and to contextualize for educators Indigenous peoples'"},"98":{"dur":3,"text":"participation in education today."},"101":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, history is usually presented to us in a linear form, where there's"},"106":{"dur":3,"text":"a starting point and an endpoint for situating events."},"110":{"dur":5,"text":"That is, we begin somewhere, and then perhaps moving to where we are now,"},"115":{"dur":5,"text":"and significant events and themes in our history are sequenced chronologically."},"120":{"dur":4,"text":"For example, many of us have learned through history and social studies"},"124":{"dur":2,"text":"that the history of Indigenous peoples really"},"127":{"dur":4,"text":"only began at the point of contact with newcomers to their lands."},"131":{"dur":4,"text":"Historical timeline would take us from a point of where,"},"136":{"dur":3,"text":"\"In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue,\""},"139":{"dur":2,"text":"a poem some of you might be familiar with,"},"141":{"dur":4,"text":"to where we are now today dealing with treaties, self-determination,"},"146":{"dur":2,"text":"and reconciliation."},"148":{"dur":4,"text":"I want to take an Indigenous approach to viewing history,"},"152":{"dur":4,"text":"which draws on a circular framework for viewing events and themes"},"157":{"dur":3,"text":"and where the past not only informs the present,"},"161":{"dur":4,"text":"but where we can return to histories over and over again."},"165":{"dur":3,"text":"This circular approach of history is reiterative,"},"169":{"dur":3,"text":"and it allows for us to see patterns in history"},"172":{"dur":2,"text":"as it moves in cycles, spiralling."},"175":{"dur":4,"text":"For Indigenous peoples, this is how we make sense of our past."},"179":{"dur":4,"text":"Unlike linear notions of time, an Indigenous circular framework"},"184":{"dur":4,"text":"does not have to assume a starting point, other than perhapsour creation stories."},"189":{"dur":4,"text":"But, even then, these stories are not fully concerned about origins."},"193":{"dur":3,"text":"These stories reflect our understanding of the world"},"196":{"dur":2,"text":"and connect us to place and land."},"199":{"dur":2,"text":"So in this circular framework of history,"},"202":{"dur":4,"text":"I want to suggest that events and themes are fluid and interconnected."},"208":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going to use the concept of the circle"},"210":{"dur":3,"text":"to talk about the history of Indigenous education with specific reference"},"214":{"dur":2,"text":"to the Canadian experience."},"217":{"dur":3,"text":"It is my hope that you can then make connections"},"220":{"dur":5,"text":"to features that characterize Indigenous education that have spiralled"},"225":{"dur":3,"text":"and continue to spiral, in your own locations."},"229":{"dur":3,"text":"There's a circular framework in Cree\/Plains"},"233":{"dur":2,"text":"tradition known as the Medicine Wheel."},"235":{"dur":4,"text":"While it may only be specific to certain Aboriginal groups and their traditions,"},"240":{"dur":3,"text":"given the diversity of Aboriginal people in Canada,"},"243":{"dur":3,"text":"I'd like to use it as an organizing framework."},"246":{"dur":5,"text":"This is a framework that has certainly been used in curriculum development and research contexts,"},"252":{"dur":4,"text":"and it gives us a holistic view of Indigenous education,"},"257":{"dur":3,"text":"allowing us to see connections between historical moments."},"261":{"dur":3,"text":"I'll map out four phases of Indigenous education."},"264":{"dur":4,"text":"I choose four because of its significance for Indigenous people,"},"269":{"dur":2,"text":"certainly here in North America."},"271":{"dur":4,"text":"The world can be observed in patterns of four, the four directions"},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"the four elements, the four seasons."},"279":{"dur":5,"text":"And I also want to point out themes of resistance and agency"},"284":{"dur":3,"text":"within the phases I'm going to describe-- agency referring"},"288":{"dur":4,"text":"to strategic and deliberate choices Indigenous peoples make"},"293":{"dur":5,"text":"about education and resistance, whereby even within colonial paradigms"},"298":{"dur":4,"text":"Indigenous peoples resisted events or experiences that"},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"were imposed upon them."},"304":{"dur":3,"text":"I will ask you to envision a circle in four quadrants."},"308":{"dur":4,"text":"And as we enter the circle, I describe features of traditional approaches"},"312":{"dur":1,"text":"to learning."},"313":{"dur":3,"text":"These were ways of living that ensured the survival of our families"},"317":{"dur":1,"text":"and communities."},"318":{"dur":5,"text":"So language, story, and experiences, these were primary modes for learning."},"323":{"dur":4,"text":"Ancestral languages transmitted a particular worldview."},"329":{"dur":3,"text":"Stories were-- they were not just about entertainment,"},"332":{"dur":3,"text":"but stories tell us who we are and how to be in the world"},"336":{"dur":3,"text":"by communicating values or our values to us."},"340":{"dur":3,"text":"They explain things for us and help us make sense of the world."},"343":{"dur":3,"text":"Learning was experiential, promoting looking,"},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"listening, and learning by doing."},"350":{"dur":5,"text":"Learning connected us to our ancestral, natural, and material worlds."},"355":{"dur":4,"text":"Land, family, and stories are sources of knowledge."},"359":{"dur":4,"text":"Our Elders, our families, extended families, knowledge keepers,"},"364":{"dur":3,"text":"and community members all share in the responsibility"},"367":{"dur":3,"text":"for helping young children to live in a good way."},"371":{"dur":4,"text":"Leading Mi'kmaq scholar Dr. Marie Battiste describes the nature of this"},"376":{"dur":4,"text":"knowledge and these ways of knowing as a complete knowledge system."},"380":{"dur":5,"text":"She tells us that Indigenous knowledge reveals the wealth and richness"},"385":{"dur":6,"text":"in our languages, worldviews, teachings, pedagogies, and experiences,"},"391":{"dur":4,"text":"which have been systematically excluded from educational institutions"},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"and from Eurocentric knowledge systems."},"398":{"dur":4,"text":"With newcomers to our lands, traditional forms of learning began to change."},"403":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is where we begin to shift about the circle."},"406":{"dur":4,"text":"It was missionaries who introduced formalized schooling approaches that"},"411":{"dur":2,"text":"included day schools or mission schools."},"413":{"dur":4,"text":"Their emphasis was on conversion of Indigenous peoples to newcomer ways,"},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"but that also included spiritual and religious conversion."},"422":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, in these phases, missionaries valued alliances"},"426":{"dur":4,"text":"with Indigenous peoples, and this is because their conversion practices"},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"required them to learn First Peoples languages."},"433":{"dur":5,"text":"There were competing religious factions, and missionaries really"},"439":{"dur":3,"text":"needed to recruit to their specific group or religion."},"442":{"dur":4,"text":"And here, Indigenous peoples exercised some choice in these instances,"},"447":{"dur":5,"text":"choosing to align themselves with specific missionary groups knowing"},"452":{"dur":3,"text":"that missionaries could be conduits to government officials."},"456":{"dur":4,"text":"As well, the practices of the Bible gave access to print forms of literacy"},"460":{"dur":4,"text":"so that learning the Bible meant learning to read and write."},"465":{"dur":5,"text":"Indigenous peoples knew the ways of the world were changing with the newcomers,"},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"and they could accommodate this change."},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"Not that they wanted to adapt or convert,"},"476":{"dur":3,"text":"but that they could be effective agents in the creation"},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"of their own world at this particular time."},"482":{"dur":4,"text":"But these relationships would change dramatically when Indigenous peoples"},"486":{"dur":4,"text":"were no longer needed as allies and really became simply"},"491":{"dur":4,"text":"threats to settler expansion that required land and resources."},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"Indigenous peoples became a problem, or the Indian problem,"},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"as it has been referred to in Canadian history."},"502":{"dur":3,"text":"This necessitated a set of policies and practices"},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"that could control Indigenous peoples."},"508":{"dur":4,"text":"One such example is the Indian Act established in 1876"},"513":{"dur":5,"text":"and continues to exert probably the greatest control on Canada's First Nations people."},"518":{"dur":4,"text":"Not only does it legally set out categories of Indigenous identity"},"523":{"dur":3,"text":"in Canada, it regulates every aspect of their lives."},"527":{"dur":3,"text":"While it's undergone changes over time, it"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"is still applied to First Nations people."},"533":{"dur":4,"text":"And this is a legislation based on the values of a dominant society"},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"and reflects their worldview."},"539":{"dur":5,"text":"It is described as both paternalistic and racist here in Canada today."},"544":{"dur":5,"text":"As part of this larger colonial agenda of eliminating the Indian problem,"},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"a system of schooling known as residential schools"},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"were established by the federal government"},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"and run by various religious denominations."},"559":{"dur":6,"text":"This system of education operated across Canada spanning over 100 years,"},"565":{"dur":6,"text":"approximately 1850s to the 1950s, with the last one closing in 1996."},"572":{"dur":3,"text":"These schools were pervasive, systematic,"},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"and totalizing in their control over Indigenous peoples."},"578":{"dur":5,"text":"This form of schooling was characterized by very destructive features that"},"584":{"dur":4,"text":"included the denigrating of belief systems, traditions, languages"},"589":{"dur":4,"text":"for students who attended these schools and, as a result,"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"generations of Aboriginal people."},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"These schools forced separation of children"},"597":{"dur":3,"text":"from their lands, families, and traditions, the very links"},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"to their cultural identity."},"604":{"dur":4,"text":"It was an education that emphasized vocational skills"},"608":{"dur":1,"text":"and religious training."},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"And this was seen in the half-day curriculum of the schools, whereby"},"613":{"dur":4,"text":"children were forced to work part of the school day within the schools"},"617":{"dur":4,"text":"to sustain their operations, as they were-these schools were seriously underfunded."},"622":{"dur":6,"text":"But what cannot go untold about these schools is the spiritual, emotional,"},"628":{"dur":4,"text":"physical, and sexual abuse that children suffered at the hands"},"633":{"dur":4,"text":"of their caregivers: religious staff, and the many unprepared teachers who"},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"couldn't get jobs in public schools."},"640":{"dur":3,"text":"I know some people have described some of the positive contributions"},"644":{"dur":4,"text":"that these schools possibly made to the lives of Aboriginal people,"},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"and there's certainly some of those stories."},"651":{"dur":5,"text":"But as I said, this is a system that was totalizing, pervasive, and systematic,"},"657":{"dur":4,"text":"and the impacts are so large-scale on Aboriginal people."},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"These effects have been described as intergenerational."},"665":{"dur":4,"text":"There were generations of children who attended these schools"},"669":{"dur":4,"text":"over a 100-year period, and the effects of this schooling"},"674":{"dur":3,"text":"are seen in the erosion of our family systems."},"678":{"dur":3,"text":"We learn to parent by being parented, by being nurtured,"},"682":{"dur":3,"text":"and these are children who, for generations, simply"},"685":{"dur":2,"text":"did not have these kinds of models."},"688":{"dur":5,"text":"And secondly, the loss of culture, languages, our ways of knowing"},"693":{"dur":5,"text":"had very serious consequences for identity and self-worth."},"699":{"dur":4,"text":"So many of the conditions endemic in our families and communities"},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"today have their roots in this history."},"706":{"dur":3,"text":"And yet there were students who resisted and survived"},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"this brutalizing form of schooling."},"712":{"dur":1,"text":"Students ran away from schools."},"714":{"dur":3,"text":"They continued to speak in their language groups"},"717":{"dur":3,"text":"and continued to practice cultural ceremonies."},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"There were even families that were able to hide their children when"},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"the Indian agent came to take-to take children away."},"727":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, it would be impossible to give-do justice"},"731":{"dur":4,"text":"to this history in the limited time that we have in this topic"},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"and certainly within the course."},"738":{"dur":2,"text":"So I encourage you to follow up with some"},"741":{"dur":4,"text":"of the very important writing on the significant shared colonial history of schooling."},"746":{"dur":4,"text":"Two comprehensive works in Canada include"},"750":{"dur":4,"text":"J.R. Miller's \u201cShingwauk's Vision\u201d and John Milloy's \u201cA National Crime\u201d."},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"They give a comprehensive history of this schooling."},"757":{"dur":2,"text":"There's also a growing body of literature"},"759":{"dur":4,"text":"that documents the experience of residential school survivors."},"763":{"dur":6,"text":"I think about Isabelle Knockwood's \u201cOut of the Depths\u201d, Basil Johnston's \u201cIndian School Days\","},"770":{"dur":2,"text":"and the book \u201cKamloops Indian Residential School\u201d,"},"773":{"dur":5,"text":"which is a set of narratives compiled by the Secwepemc Cultural Society,"},"778":{"dur":4,"text":"as well as recent publications by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission"},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"such as \u201cSpeaking My Truth\u201d."},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"These are only a few."},"788":{"dur":3,"text":"But for educators, we are seeing residential school accounts"},"791":{"dur":3,"text":"narrated in young adolescent and children's literature."},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think this is very important for thinking"},"797":{"dur":3,"text":"about this history in schooling."},"800":{"dur":4,"text":"So, \u201cMy Name Is Seepeetza\u201d by Nlaka'pamux author Dr. Shirley Sterling,"},"805":{"dur":5,"text":"and there are certainly accompanying curriculum documents with this"},"810":{"dur":2,"text":"particular text that are available online."},"812":{"dur":4,"text":"\u201cFatty Legs\u201d, which is co-constructed by Margaret Pokiak-Fenton"},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"and her daughter-in-law, Christy Jordan Fenton,"},"819":{"dur":4,"text":"and then a version for younger children of this story called \u201cWhen I Was Eight\u201d."},"824":{"dur":2,"text":"And of course, the beautiful books written by"},"827":{"dur":2,"text":"St\u00f3:lo author Nicola Campbell."},"829":{"dur":2,"text":"She's produced two excellent children's books,"},"831":{"dur":3,"text":"\u201cShi-shi-etko\u201d as well as \u201cShin-chi's Canoe\u201d."},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"And these are very important contributions"},"837":{"dur":3,"text":"that can introduce young children to the significant experience"},"841":{"dur":2,"text":"of residential schools."},"843":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, for some of you, you may be learning"},"845":{"dur":3,"text":"about this very dark part of Canadian history for the first time,"},"849":{"dur":3,"text":"and for others it contributes to your ongoing journey"},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"in Indigenous education."},"855":{"dur":4,"text":"But this is a history that we cannot deny, erase, or even forget about."},"860":{"dur":2,"text":"This is a history that is not over."},"862":{"dur":4,"text":"Our families and communities still carry the effects of this schooling,"},"866":{"dur":3,"text":"even if they themselves did not attend these schools."},"870":{"dur":4,"text":"Our circular framework allows us to return to this history,"},"875":{"dur":3,"text":"not that we would ever return to this form of schooling,"},"878":{"dur":6,"text":"but return to this history to remember, to heal, and to help us, all of us,"},"884":{"dur":2,"text":"understand the intergenerational legacy."},"887":{"dur":3,"text":"As Indigenous and non-Indigenous educators,"},"890":{"dur":4,"text":"we are responsible for this history, whether we were present at the time or not."},"895":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a history that belongs to all of us,"},"898":{"dur":3,"text":"and we are all inheritors of this history and, as such,"},"902":{"dur":2,"text":"need to redress this past."},"904":{"dur":4,"text":"I now turn to the fourth phase of education and the final turn"},"909":{"dur":1,"text":"to complete our circle."},"911":{"dur":2,"text":"The fourth phase represents contemporary forms"},"914":{"dur":2,"text":"of schooling for Aboriginal learners."},"916":{"dur":4,"text":"Before I describe some of the features of Indigenous education in this phase,"},"921":{"dur":2,"text":"I want to acknowledge the landmark policy"},"923":{"dur":3,"text":"of Indian Control of Indian Education, which was really"},"927":{"dur":3,"text":"a catalyst for educational change for our people."},"930":{"dur":4,"text":"It was a policy that emerged in 1972 as part of a larger shift in policy"},"935":{"dur":2,"text":"directed at Indigenous peoples."},"938":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's important because it entrenched Indigenous peoples'"},"941":{"dur":3,"text":"right to make decisions about their children's education."},"944":{"dur":4,"text":"It acknowledged Indigenous culture, language, and traditions"},"949":{"dur":1,"text":"as foundations for learning."},"950":{"dur":4,"text":"And finally, it intended to ensure parental involvement."},"955":{"dur":2,"text":"While significant as this policy has been"},"957":{"dur":4,"text":"to ensure Indigenous peoples' control over educational processes"},"962":{"dur":3,"text":"that impact on their children, Indigenous children"},"965":{"dur":5,"text":"have still not achieved academic parity as compared to their non-Indigenous peers."},"971":{"dur":3,"text":"More recently, a second legislation was proposed,"},"974":{"dur":5,"text":"Bill C-33, the First Nations Control of First Nations Education Act."},"980":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, this legislation was intended to provide First Nations students"},"984":{"dur":3,"text":"with education standards, supports, and opportunities"},"988":{"dur":4,"text":"that would lead to equitable education for Indigenous students."},"992":{"dur":4,"text":"It emphasized a core curriculum that would be taught in First Nations schools"},"997":{"dur":4,"text":"so that students could transfer between schools on- and off-reserve,"},"1001":{"dur":4,"text":"as well as improving school attendance and the quality of teaching."},"1006":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, the legislation has been rejected by First Nations governments and their leaders"},"1011":{"dur":4,"text":"as the legislation really does not give control to First Nations."},"1015":{"dur":4,"text":"Rather the federal government would maintain governing structures"},"1019":{"dur":2,"text":"and continue to regulate standards."},"1022":{"dur":4,"text":"In addition, it does not address the challenges facing First Nations"},"1026":{"dur":3,"text":"education that relate to the lack of adequate funding."},"1030":{"dur":3,"text":"These are only a few of the limitations of this bill that"},"1034":{"dur":3,"text":"may offer potential change in the curriculum of schooling"},"1038":{"dur":4,"text":"serving First Nations students, certainly in on-reserve communities,"},"1042":{"dur":2,"text":"and address issues of accountability."},"1045":{"dur":4,"text":"But the bill itself continues to undermine First Nations"},"1050":{"dur":2,"text":"control of First Nations education."},"1053":{"dur":3,"text":"Again, the development of Indian Control of Indian Education"},"1057":{"dur":3,"text":"as a response to larger policy directed at Aboriginal people in Canada"},"1060":{"dur":3,"text":"and the rejection of this newly-proposed legislation"},"1064":{"dur":5,"text":"are demonstrations of Indigenous peoples' agency and resistance."},"1070":{"dur":3,"text":"I'd like to turn now to the features that"},"1073":{"dur":3,"text":"characterize this phase of contemporary education."},"1076":{"dur":4,"text":"In this phase, we see the emergence of First Nations community"},"1080":{"dur":4,"text":"control of schools and supporting structures for these schools."},"1085":{"dur":3,"text":"I use the example of the First Nations Education Steering Committee"},"1089":{"dur":3,"text":"here in British Columbia, which is doing excellent work to advance"},"1092":{"dur":3,"text":"educational priorities not only for First Nations schools,"},"1096":{"dur":3,"text":"but to provincial education programming."},"1099":{"dur":4,"text":"And I'm referring here to current curriculum resources that"},"1103":{"dur":4,"text":"include English First Peoples 11, English First Peoples 12,"},"1107":{"dur":1,"text":"and First Peoples Math."},"1109":{"dur":2,"text":"And these are resources that are available online,"},"1112":{"dur":3,"text":"and they validate the ways that Indigenous content"},"1116":{"dur":2,"text":"can be linked to provincial curriculum."},"1119":{"dur":2,"text":"There is also a greater range of schooling options"},"1122":{"dur":3,"text":"for Indigenous learners in the Canadian education landscape."},"1125":{"dur":3,"text":"So, for example, Aboriginal Focus Schools have"},"1129":{"dur":2,"text":"been developed within provincial school boards."},"1132":{"dur":4,"text":"And I'm thinking here about the Joe Duquette secondary school,"},"1136":{"dur":2,"text":"Now known as Oskayak."},"1139":{"dur":4,"text":"The Vancouver School Board has an Aboriginal Focus School, as well as"},"1143":{"dur":3,"text":"one in Prince George, both in British Columbia, Canada."},"1147":{"dur":2,"text":"While not specific to K to 12 schooling,"},"1150":{"dur":4,"text":"I want to introduce you to an early childhood intervention program,"},"1155":{"dur":2,"text":"the Aboriginal Head Start program."},"1157":{"dur":3,"text":"This is a national program in Canada"},"1160":{"dur":3,"text":"operating in urban, rural, and First Nations communities."},"1164":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's very different from the Head Start model in the US,"},"1168":{"dur":4,"text":"as this program was developed based on national consultation"},"1173":{"dur":2,"text":"with Canada's Aboriginal people."},"1175":{"dur":2,"text":"And it operates on foundational principles"},"1178":{"dur":4,"text":"that include culture and language, family involvement,"},"1182":{"dur":4,"text":"social support for Aboriginal children, but also school readiness."},"1188":{"dur":5,"text":"This program contributes to a holistic view of Indigenous education"},"1193":{"dur":4,"text":"as it links early childhood to elementary schools."},"1198":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, what these contemporary examples demonstrate for us"},"1201":{"dur":5,"text":"are the very values and practices within traditional approaches to learning"},"1207":{"dur":4,"text":"that I described earlier or at the beginning phase of the circle."},"1212":{"dur":2,"text":"These examples, among numerous others,"},"1215":{"dur":3,"text":"centre Indigenous ways of knowing in the learning processes."},"1219":{"dur":1,"text":"Learning is holistic."},"1220":{"dur":3,"text":"It engages families and communities in education,"},"1224":{"dur":2,"text":"draws on Indigenous pedagogies."},"1226":{"dur":4,"text":"So that the sources of knowledge, the processes of learning,"},"1231":{"dur":4,"text":"and even the functions that learning serves -We return to these-"},"1235":{"dur":3,"text":"or we return to traditional forms with these examples."},"1239":{"dur":4,"text":"So as we come full circle, this view of history"},"1243":{"dur":3,"text":"ensures that we do not move forward without looking back and engaging"},"1247":{"dur":2,"text":"and engaging with a shared past."}}
