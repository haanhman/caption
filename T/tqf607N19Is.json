issues\nand mental illnesses"},"208":{"dur":1,"text":"are distinct from one another."},"210":{"dur":1,"text":"So going back to my broken leg analogy,"},"212":{"dur":4,"text":"that would be, 'Well, you are exhibiting\nall the symptoms of a broken leg,"},"216":{"dur":3,"text":"but that's distinct\nfrom actually having a broken leg.'"},"219":{"dur":1,"text":"And that sounds stupid,"},"221":{"dur":3,"text":"but there is actually some really\ngood evidence to support that theory,"},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"that the two are distinct\nfrom one another."},"227":{"dur":3,"text":"I meander between the two;\nI can be convinced either way."},"231":{"dur":3,"text":"However, whichever theory\nyou subscribe to,"},"235":{"dur":2,"text":"the solution

unemployment;"},"289":{"dur":3,"text":"that they were worried\nabout leaving university"},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"with record amounts of debt;"},"295":{"dur":5,"text":"that they were worried that a

cases, an economic issue."},"350":{"dur":3,"text":"Because 49% of sixth-formers"},"353":{"dur":2,"text":"say that concerns about their future"},"356":{"dur":5,"text":"are a significant reason\nwhy
