that\nis what I'm quite interested"},"103":{"dur":4,"text":"in because the west coast\nsalmon have this habit of --"},"108":{"dur":3,"text":"Nearly all of them die -- All\nbut one die after

years of growth."},"118":{"dur":4,"text":"They come back and they die\nand they don't go quietly."},"122":{"dur":1,"text":"They can die in very large numbers."},"124":{"dur":2,"text":"They can wash up

coming up the streams every fall"},"150":{"dur":2,"text":"and this goes on over a very large area."},"153":{"dur":4,"text":"And so the area I'm interested in\napplying this to is our understanding"},"158":{"dur":3,"text":"of how cross-boundary nutrient subsidies\nwork, and there are other examples."},"162":{"dur":5,"text":"So, for example, on islands well known examples\nare seaweed washing up, as you can see here,"},"167":{"dur":4,"text":"or bird colonies, where you\nhave lots of guano deposited."},"171":{"dur":5,"text":"These are marine derived nutrients, and

productivity is driven by\nnutrients coming from the sea."},"188":{"dur":1,"text":"And, of course, they can go the other way."},"189":{"dur":5,"text":"So, freshwater people are quite\nused to the idea

the way from California\nand up and around to Japan and Korea,"},"239":{"dur":5,"text":"and this shows how far inland they penetrate\nfrom the various species that are

Fisheries"},"297":{"dur":4,"text":"and Oceans wrote on salmon carcass-planting\nprocedures for Vancouver Island."},"303":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't know why Vancouver Island has\na different handbook from other places"},"306":{"dur":1,"text":"or maybe they just didn't get around to it."},"308":{"dur":3,"text":"But there is already this idea that\nthese carcasses could be important"},"311":{"dur":3,"text":"and sustaining our freshwater\nriparian ecosystems."},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"But there's a bit more to\nthe story, isn't there?"},"317":{"dur":2,"text":"If any of you have ever watched salmon spawning,"},"319":{"dur":2,"text":"here's a video I took a few\nyears ago up in our study area."},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's just think about what's happening."},"325":{"dur":0,"text":"These are chum salmon."},"326":{"dur":5,"text":"So, here are some males fighting,\njockeying for position."},"332":{"dur":6,"text":"You can see they are not subtle and\nthey are smashing the rocks around."},"338":{"dur":3,"text":"The females are digging nests with\ntheir tails, smashing things around."},"341":{"dur":3,"text":"They're going to be suspending\na lot of particulate matter."},"345":{"dur":4,"text":"They're going to be clearing\noff and scouring the area --"},"349":{"dur":4,"text":"You see there's a bit of a mosaic here of areas\nwith algae on the rocks and areas without algae,"},"354":{"dur":5,"text":"and so there's a whole lot of perturbation\nand engineering going on as a result"},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"of their spawning activities, and\nso some people have actually argued"},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"that they might actually be exporting\nmore nutrients than they're bringing"},"365":{"dur":5,"text":"in because they're actually sending these\nthings downstream; and in a coastal stream,"},"370":{"dur":2,"text":"they might be sending them\nright out of the system."},"372":{"dur":4,"text":"So, it's not as simple as the person\nwith the dead carcass might think."},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"They might think they're\nhaving some sort of an effect,"},"379":{"dur":4,"text":"but we're certainly not mimicking\nwhat actually goes on in wild streams."},"385":{"dur":1,"text":"Here's another way to look at it."},"386":{"dur":5,"text":"This is a photograph from the Skeena\nRiver in northern British Columbia."},"392":{"dur":4,"text":"It's a very, very large and complicated\nwatershed that it's part of here."},"396":{"dur":7,"text":"And these here are basically gravel\nbars that have been created as a result"},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"of the spawning behaviour of Chinook salmon."},"406":{"dur":1,"text":"Chinook salmon can be very big."},"407":{"dur":3,"text":"It's the biggest salmon and they\ncan move very large boulders"},"411":{"dur":3,"text":"when they're digging and\nthen these are accumulating."},"414":{"dur":3,"text":"These are the result of their\nactual spawning behaviour."},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"They roll downstream and they're\naccumulating in these patterns."},"420":{"dur":4,"text":"So, when we say \"ecosystem engineer\",\nthat's probably an apt description here."},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"Again, just to emphasize\nthat they're having more"},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"than just a nutrient input\neffect on the streams."},"429":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I wanted to ask what are\nthe ecosystem effects of salmon,"},"433":{"dur":4,"text":"and toward the end I'll just\ntake maybe three slides just sort"},"437":{"dur":1,"text":"of with some thoughts and I don't have answers."},"438":{"dur":4,"text":"This really is a question that stays a question,\nbut some thoughts about what we might do"},"443":{"dur":3,"text":"with this information if we're\ninterested in ecosystem-based management."},"446":{"dur":5,"text":"How could we incorporate this information into\nwhat we might be trying to accomplish in terms"},"452":{"dur":3,"text":"of conservation of salmon as\nwell as their wider ecosystems."},"458":{"dur":5,"text":"So, we're set up in an area\ncalled the Great Bear Rainforest."},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"This you can see it's a big\narea here from adjacent"},"466":{"dur":8,"text":"to northern Vancouver Island all the way up to\nthe Alaskan border, and you see how green it is."},"475":{"dur":4,"text":"This is a map of logging that\nhas occurred in B.C. since 1970."},"480":{"dur":5,"text":"So, it gives you some idea that it's a little\ndifferent from everywhere else in southern"},"485":{"dur":4,"text":"and middle B.C. in that it hasn't been\nlogged nearly as much as many other areas."},"490":{"dur":5,"text":"Even in Haida Gwaii here, which we think of\noften, you know, for its wonderful

there."},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"But the thing here is that there\nare no roads into this zone here."},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"There are no roads at all, and\nso it's very difficult to get to,"},"508":{"dur":3,"text":"and the loggers didn't get there,\nexcept for some selective high grading"},"512":{"dur":3,"text":"in some of the coastal river valleys."},"515":{"dur":2,"text":"So, it's a good place to look\nif you want to go to somewhere"},"518":{"dur":3,"text":"where there might be somewhat\nsemi-natural ecosystems."},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"This is not say it's never\nbeen impacted by people."},"523":{"dur":4,"text":"It's been heavily impacted by the\nfact that there are 10 to 11,000 years"},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"of continuous occupation by\nfirst nations people there."},"531":{"dur":4,"text":"For sure, if you have your eye in and you go out\nwith archeologist, they'll show you the middens;"},"536":{"dur":3,"text":"they'll show you the campsites,\nthe fish traps, and so on."},"539":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I'm not saying it has not been impacted,\nbut people have been part of these ecosystems"},"544":{"dur":1,"text":"for a very long time but not in the way"},"546":{"dur":5,"text":"that most people are today\nin terms of land conversion."},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we work -- This is Bella Bella."},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll show you a photo of

there."},"587":{"dur":4,"text":"So, all these sites are reached by\nboats, and we've done various amounts"},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"of work in a number of these watersheds."},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"And so here's Bella Bella."},"598":{"dur":3,"text":"That's about a 15-minute boat ride away from\nwhere we are and we're working with people"},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"from the Heiltsuk Integrated\nResource

here."},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"Huge numbers of streams,\nwhich is why I chose it."},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"I wanted a large number of streams\nbecause the unit of

sea."},"665":{"dur":1,"text":"So, it's essentially a watershed."},"667":{"dur":5,"text":"Huge variety of watersheds\nthat we can make comparisons"},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"for looking at the effects of these fish."},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll introduce the players:\nchum salmon and pink salmon."},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"We don't have sockeye in\nthe streams that we work on."},"679":{"dur":4,"text":"There are some sockeye salmon around, but I'm\ngoing to be talking almost entirely about pink"},"684":{"dur":5,"text":"and chum salmon, and we have coho salmon\nin all of the streams but they tend"},"690":{"dur":3,"text":"to spawn further upstream than where we work"},"693":{"dur":1,"text":"and their carcasses are not\nreally part of the story."},"695":{"dur":3,"text":"They don't deposit a lot of carcasses\nthat find their way to where we work,"},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"but their juveniles will be part of the\nstory because their juvenile coho --"},"702":{"dur":5,"text":"the little ones that spend a year in\nfreshwater -- they're there all the time;"},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"and so we will be talking a bit about those."},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"The other players are the bears."},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"We have both bear species\nand these fishing wolves."},"715":{"dur":5,"text":"This photo was actually not taken in our study\narea, but we have these extremely marine wolves."},"720":{"dur":6,"text":"The majority of their diet is marine things and\nthey're very good at fishing, as you can see."},"727":{"dur":0,"text":"They're not scavengers."},"728":{"dur":4,"text":"These are fishing wolves and they account\nfor a very large proportion of the carcasses"},"733":{"dur":1,"text":"that get deposited on the stream banks,"},"734":{"dur":6,"text":"especially down near the salt marshes near the\nareas where they keep their pups and so on."},"741":{"dur":5,"text":"And actually this area has arguably the\nmost intact large carnivore assemblage"},"747":{"dur":4,"text":"in North America -- even in the Arctic, which\nthose who haven't been there tend to think"},"752":{"dur":6,"text":"of as reasonably pristine; but as we all know,\nthe Arctic is again very much used by people;"},"758":{"dur":4,"text":"and with the overall lack\nof hunting going on here,"},"763":{"dur":4,"text":"except for a very controversial\ntrophy hunt for Grizzly bears,"},"768":{"dur":4,"text":"these carnivore assemblages are basically\npretty much as they would have always been."},"773":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's important because they're the\nones that drag a lot of the carcasses out"},"776":{"dur":1,"text":"and leave them there for me to study."},"778":{"dur":3,"text":"So, here's my boot and chum salmon."},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"Now that's been taken by a wolf."},"785":{"dur":3,"text":"They tend to eat the brain or the head\nand they tend not to eat the musculature."},"789":{"dur":1,"text":"It's thought that it's because\nthere may be a parasite"},"791":{"dur":1,"text":"in the body musculature that they can get."},"792":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not for sure."},"794":{"dur":3,"text":"We don't know, but most carcasses\nyou can tell who did it,"},"798":{"dur":4,"text":"whereas a bear will actually eat the\nbody muscles and gonads and so on."},"803":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I'm going to just give you a\nfly-through of some highlights of some"},"806":{"dur":1,"text":"of the areas that we've been studying."},"808":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going to first of all start\nwith some freshwater examples."},"811":{"dur":3,"text":"I won't talk about every link in\nthis sort of simplified food chain."},"815":{"dur":3,"text":"I won't talk about periphyton\nbut we've worked on that."},"818":{"dur":3,"text":"We'll talk about aquatic\nstream insects, coho salmon."},"822":{"dur":4,"text":"I won't talk about our sculpin work but just\nto give you an idea of the way things are sort"},"826":{"dur":4,"text":"of put together and then we'll also\nspend a little bit of time on land."},"831":{"dur":1,"text":"We are doing some work on bears."},"833":{"dur":7,"text":"I won't mention that but we will go into plants,\nscavenging birds, and breeding songbirds."},"841":{"dur":3,"text":"There is a marine access here, too,\nwhich I'm not going to go into."},"845":{"dur":2,"text":"We've looked at estuary productivity as well."},"848":{"dur":3,"text":"But what I'm going to do is I'm just\ngoing to give you some highlights of some"},"851":{"dur":4,"text":"of the work we'll be doing, asking this\nquestion of whether there are detectable impacts"},"856":{"dur":3,"text":"of salmon on various elements\nof these ecosystems."},"860":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I want to begin then\nwith work on aquatic insects."},"863":{"dur":4,"text":"So, we've had a couple of people working on\nthis and actually we work in the Fraser too,"},"868":{"dur":7,"text":"but I'm going to talk about Jennifer\nHarding's work briefly for her Ph.D."},"875":{"dur":4,"text":"and she was studying both periphyton, which\nI'll leave out, and also stream insects"},"880":{"dur":7,"text":"and simply asked what the effects are of\nsalmon on the insects in these streams."},"887":{"dur":8,"text":"So, here's the n15 stable isotope\n-- heavy isotope of nitrogen --"},"897":{"dur":4,"text":"ratio and here it is plotted against\nsalmon density in the spring and the fall;"},"902":{"dur":5,"text":"and so what we have here -- I've actually\nlost my legend but I'll make it up."},"907":{"dur":3,"text":"Here's the density of salmon."},"910":{"dur":3,"text":"So, each of these is a different\nstream, although we may have more"},"914":{"dur":2,"text":"than one trophic group of insect on the way."},"917":{"dur":1,"text":"The top line are predators, okay?"},"918":{"dur":5,"text":"The bottom line are grazers; and so basically\nthere's this tendency for all of the groups,"},"924":{"dur":4,"text":"especially the upper levels,\nto increase in streams --"},"928":{"dur":8,"text":"at least the n15 trophic signal is increasing --\nbecause salmon have a very high n15 signature;"},"937":{"dur":4,"text":"and that's particularly true in the fall; and\nthat, of course, is when the salmon are there;"},"942":{"dur":2,"text":"but we can still kind of see\na bit of a legacy of this"},"945":{"dur":2,"text":"in the spring invertebrates\nthat are there as well."},"947":{"dur":3,"text":"So, from that you might think, \"Okay,\nthere's a benefit somehow to the insects."},"951":{"dur":2,"text":"They seem to be consuming\nsalmon derived nutrients.\""},"954":{"dur":4,"text":"We think a lot of this is coming from the\nalgae and the periphyton that it's scraping."},"958":{"dur":3,"text":"Some of it may be coming directly\nfrom the carcasses themselves."},"963":{"dur":7,"text":"But if you ask about the actual\nbiomass of invertebrates,"},"970":{"dur":3,"text":"which is what I'm a lot more interested\nin -- In fact, it's the opposite."},"974":{"dur":4,"text":"So, here we see different streams in the dots\nhere, the density of these streams from very few"},"979":{"dur":7,"text":"to lots, and you can see that in the spring and\nthe fall we get actually fewer invertebrates"},"986":{"dur":1,"text":"in the streams when there are more salmon."},"989":{"dur":5,"text":"This has been foreshadowed by some\nwork that was also done in Alaska,"},"994":{"dur":2,"text":"and I think that this is the scouring\neffect that I was referring to."},"997":{"dur":6,"text":"I think that when the salmon arrive,\nthey simply cause a very immediate drop"},"1003":{"dur":2,"text":"in the spawning region --\nwhich the salmon are there --"},"1006":{"dur":1,"text":"and I think it's because\nof this scouring effect."},"1008":{"dur":3,"text":"So, this is an example of the engineering\neffect, although they're taking"},"1012":{"dur":3,"text":"up the nutrients, I think the engineering\neffect is having an overall cause"},"1016":{"dur":2,"text":"for an immediate drop in their numbers."},"1018":{"dur":3,"text":"Clearly those numbers are rebounding\nby the time the next year comes around,"},"1022":{"dur":1,"text":"or else there would be no bugs left."},"1024":{"dur":3,"text":"But it does appear that they're\ncausing this localized decline."},"1029":{"dur":2,"text":"So, now I want to talk about\nfish; and, as I said,"},"1031":{"dur":2,"text":"we studied two species of\nsculpins as well as coho."},"1034":{"dur":5,"text":"In the middle here is Michelle\nNelson, who did her Ph.D. on these,"},"1040":{"dur":4,"text":"and the thinking behind this one was that --"},"1045":{"dur":3,"text":"This is the chum salmon with those\nsort of wine stains down the side."},"1049":{"dur":5,"text":"The chum salmon does not spend any\ntime in freshwater after they hatch."},"1055":{"dur":1,"text":"So, they spawn in the fall."},"1057":{"dur":4,"text":"The eggs go in the gravel; they overwinter out,\ncome the fry in the spring, and they go straight"},"1061":{"dur":1,"text":"to the sea and they're really tiny."},"1063":{"dur":3,"text":"They use up their yolk sac\nand they're gone, okay?"},"1067":{"dur":6,"text":"And so they have no way of benefitting from\nsalmon derived nutrients from generations past"},"1074":{"dur":2,"text":"because they don't feed in freshwater, okay?"},"1077":{"dur":4,"text":"But coho juveniles do because most of\nour coho spend one year in freshwater"},"1081":{"dur":6,"text":"and about 10-15 percent spend 2 years\nin freshwater before they go out to sea."},"1088":{"dur":5,"text":"So, the question was whether chum and pink\nsalmon, which have the same life history --"},"1093":{"dur":5,"text":"straight to sea -- whether their nutrients\ncould be crossing over through the food webs"},"1099":{"dur":6,"text":"and affecting the growth or survival\nand densities of juvenile coho salmon."},"1106":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we've done all sorts of methods."},"1108":{"dur":6,"text":"We started off with just simple minnow trapping,\nwhich eventually turned into [inaudible]"},"1114":{"dur":4,"text":"and it turned into electrofishing, and\nwe've put things together in various ways"},"1119":{"dur":2,"text":"and tried to overcome various biases here."},"1122":{"dur":2,"text":"And here's an index of juvenile coho

to\nbe the best correlate of the abundance,"},"1135":{"dur":3,"text":"and you can see if you have\nfew or in some cases no salmon"},"1139":{"dur":1,"text":"because of waterfalls right\nat the mouth of the stream."},"1140":{"dur":4,"text":"So, we have some ultra-controls\nwhere there's no salmon at all,"},"1145":{"dur":4,"text":"and you can see it's quite scattered at low\nnumbers and then it runs up to some sort"},"1149":{"dur":4,"text":"of an asymptote here in terms of the\nabundance of these juvenile coho salmon;"},"1155":{"dur":5,"text":"and here's what it looks like if\nyou compare different variables"},"1160":{"dur":1,"text":"that might explain the summer coho."},"1162":{"dur":6,"text":"Pink salmon and stream size together are in the\ntop model with not a terribly high model

certainty."},"1192":{"dur":2,"text":"Again, it tends to be pink\nand the stream size that win."},"1195":{"dur":4,"text":"Now this we believe is not just because\nstreams that are good for pink salmon"},"1200":{"dur":1,"text":"and chum salmon are also good for coho, right?"},"1202":{"dur":3,"text":"You could argue that that's just a, you know,\nspurious correlation, not a causative

can,"},"1214":{"dur":10,"text":"not only to try to explain the juvenile cohos,\nbut also to understand the numbers of chum"},"1225":{"dur":5,"text":"and pink salmon, the nutrient producers;\nand the long story short is that --"},"1230":{"dur":3,"text":"The most parsimonious explanation is\nthat this is not a spurious correlation."},"1234":{"dur":3,"text":"The correlations are there but they're\nnot so high that we're breaking any rules"},"1237":{"dur":2,"text":"by putting them both into\nthe same model and so on."},"1239":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we think that this is\nprobably the reason it happens"},"1243":{"dur":2,"text":"but we haven't done an experimental --"},"1246":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, it would be nice if you could take\na whole stream and keep the fish out one year"},"1249":{"dur":3,"text":"and see what happens, but nobody\nis going to let us do that."},"1253":{"dur":3,"text":"So, then I wanted to now move on to\nland a little bit and talk a little bit"},"1256":{"dur":3,"text":"about the bird work and this is work\nthat was kicked off by Rachel Field."},"1260":{"dur":2,"text":"We've pushed this on a little\nbit since her time there."},"1263":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm an avid birder; so it was, of course,\nonly a matter of time before I tried to figure"},"1268":{"dur":3,"text":"out whether we could try to\ntie salmon to bird populations."},"1271":{"dur":5,"text":"And my original idea was that I would do point\ncounts along streams where you stop and listen,"},"1277":{"dur":1,"text":"you know, to all the birds you can hear."},"1279":{"dur":3,"text":"The problem is when you're standing in a\nstream it's very hard to hear the birds,"},"1282":{"dur":4,"text":"and so I thought the easiest thing to start\nwith would be to simply look at the forest birds"},"1286":{"dur":4,"text":"that are breeding around estuaries because\nnearly all of the detections here are just"},"1291":{"dur":6,"text":"by ear, and so that was Rachel's job\nfor two years, and we did it both"},"1297":{"dur":5,"text":"in the fall counting the scavenger birds and\nwe also looked at the songbirds in the spring."},"1304":{"dur":3,"text":"So, here's an example of some fall research."},"1308":{"dur":3,"text":"So, here you have the total,\nagain, carcass biomass."},"1312":{"dur":6,"text":"This is almost always on my axis in some sort of\nunits here and an index of scavenger abundance"},"1318":{"dur":5,"text":"and this includes ravens, crows,\nabout six species of gulls --"},"1323":{"dur":3,"text":"there's about four common ones\nthere -- bald eagles, and so on."},"1327":{"dur":3,"text":"Now streams are represented more than once here."},"1331":{"dur":1,"text":"We didn't have that many streams."},"1332":{"dur":5,"text":"So, in some cases this represents multiple\nvisits through the fall of the same stream,"},"1338":{"dur":2,"text":"but in the statistics we accounted for that."},"1340":{"dur":4,"text":"And you can see there's a reasonably strong\nrelationship here, still lots of scatter"},"1346":{"dur":7,"text":"between the numbers of scavengers that you see\nin the fall and the biomass of the carcasses"},"1353":{"dur":4,"text":"that are coming down from the streams\nhere, and I don't think that's, you know,"},"1358":{"dur":4,"text":"the most earth shattering discovery;\nand I think Rachel would agree with me."},"1363":{"dur":5,"text":"We have basically the birds are distributing\nthemselves according to the abundance"},"1368":{"dur":2,"text":"of their food and they're moving among them."},"1371":{"dur":3,"text":"I, of course -- What we're now doing\nI said, being somewhat mischievous,"},"1375":{"dur":6,"text":"I said you know we could flip these

right?"},"1392":{"dur":3,"text":"So, we're now working on sort of some\nsimulations to ask how much more information --"},"1396":{"dur":4,"text":"how many more streams could you look at in a\ncost-benefit framework compared to the loss"},"1400":{"dur":1,"text":"of information by not counting the fish."},"1402":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't expect anybody is going to buy it."},"1403":{"dur":3,"text":"We'll never get it published because\npeople have their ways of counting fish,"},"1408":{"dur":3,"text":"but anyway we're just going to play\naround with that a little bit more."},"1412":{"dur":5,"text":"One thing that was kind of cool was that\nwe also asked whether it mattered --"},"1418":{"dur":1,"text":"We looked at all the different species."},"1419":{"dur":2,"text":"They all kind of came out the same way."},"1422":{"dur":1,"text":"So, you don't have to distinguish among gulls."},"1424":{"dur":1,"text":"Not everybody can tell the gulls apart."},"1425":{"dur":0,"text":"That doesn't matter."},"1426":{"dur":2,"text":"You don't have to distinguish among\nthe gulls because they're similar."},"1428":{"dur":6,"text":"The one thing was that if you\ncompared senescent fish --"},"1434":{"dur":4,"text":"fish that have just died after spawning --\nor ones that are being killed by predators,"},"1441":{"dur":5,"text":"eagles were most correlated with freshly killed\ncarcasses that have been opened up by predators."},"1447":{"dur":3,"text":"So, the eagles obviously are more\ninterested in the fresh

puncture and rip into carcasses."},"1457":{"dur":1,"text":"They tend to take eggs."},"1458":{"dur":4,"text":"So, the eagles could obviously rip open\na carcass if they want to but eagles seem"},"1463":{"dur":4,"text":"to be associated indirectly,\ntherefore, with large carnivores"},"1468":{"dur":2,"text":"that are making these prey available to them."},"1471":{"dur":1,"text":"That was new."},"1474":{"dur":4,"text":"Then we asked, \"What if you go in the\nspring when the breeding birds are there?\""},"1479":{"dur":4,"text":"So, this shows the density of birds."},"1483":{"dur":4,"text":"So, it's controlling for the size of the\nestuary; it's per hectare, okay, against --"},"1488":{"dur":3,"text":"again -- pink and chum biomass\ntogether in streams;"},"1492":{"dur":3,"text":"and each stream is represented\nin two different years."},"1495":{"dur":2,"text":"You can see that if you look\non the far side, right?"},"1497":{"dur":2,"text":"So, there's two different years there."},"1500":{"dur":2,"text":"We had fairly consistent\nresults between the streams."},"1502":{"dur":4,"text":"So, a stream with a lot of salmon over here,\nyou know,

seems to often be the case,\nit's highly variable if you have very few"},"1519":{"dur":3,"text":"or no salmon here, but then\nit seems to go up to some sort"},"1523":{"dur":2,"text":"of an increase here in the\nnumber of breeding birds."},"1526":{"dur":4,"text":"Now we've looked at all sorts of\nadditional covariates because we always have"},"1531":{"dur":1,"text":"to with these correlational studies."},"1532":{"dur":4,"text":"That's why I needed big sample sizes\nas much as we could with these streams,"},"1538":{"dur":3,"text":"and this seems to be the most\nparsimonious explanation,"},"1542":{"dur":2,"text":"but I want to point something out to you."},"1545":{"dur":3,"text":"This Townsend's warbler and\nthis Pacific-slope flycatcher --"},"1549":{"dur":4,"text":"which are a fairly prominent part of the data\nset -- they've never seen a salmon, okay?"},"1554":{"dur":1,"text":"They've never seen a salmon carcass."},"1555":{"dur":2,"text":"They've never seen a salmon egg\nbecause they're migratory, okay?"},"1557":{"dur":3,"text":"They're gone by the time the\nsalmon arrive in the fall, okay?"},"1561":{"dur":4,"text":"So, this is not -- for them at least\n-- it's not because there's a direct --"},"1566":{"dur":3,"text":"they're not feeding on eggs; they're not\nfeeding on carcasses or anything like that."},"1571":{"dur":1,"text":"Now these other ones we occasionally --"},"1573":{"dur":2,"text":"Like I've seen varied thrushes\ncertainly picking at salmon eggs."},"1576":{"dur":5,"text":"I've never seen a kinglet; they're\ninsectivores; they're not going to be doing it."},"1581":{"dur":4,"text":"But the point is that these breeding\nbird assemblages are occurring"},"1585":{"dur":5,"text":"when there are no salmon in town whatsoever,\nand so what we think is probably happening is"},"1590":{"dur":5,"text":"that the overall productivity of the estuary\nmay be enhanced by these carcasses coming down"},"1596":{"dur":3,"text":"and perhaps it's through the insect prey."},"1600":{"dur":2,"text":"It's also possible -- we've tested for this --"},"1602":{"dur":3,"text":"that it has to do with structure of\nthe vegetation being somehow affected."},"1607":{"dur":6,"text":"And so if you look at the total density of\nbirds, for example, the top model has salmon"},"1613":{"dur":2,"text":"and estuary area even though\nit's a density estimate."},"1616":{"dur":2,"text":"So, even though we've sort of controlled for it,"},"1618":{"dur":2,"text":"there's still something about\nthe larger estuaries."},"1620":{"dur":6,"text":"Perhaps there is additional productivity and\nso on over and above just the size of the strip"},"1627":{"dur":7,"text":"of land around the estuary that we census,\nor it could be salmon estuary area and shrub."},"1634":{"dur":3,"text":"So, we did all sorts of forest\nplots here and, again, similar idea."},"1639":{"dur":3,"text":"I guess my point is that salmon -- although\nthey're appearing in all of the models --"},"1643":{"dur":5,"text":"I don't want you to think it's just salmon and\nI don't want you to think salmon are only --"},"1648":{"dur":3,"text":"If you put this all together and average\nacross the models, they are the top model;"},"1651":{"dur":4,"text":"they are the top parameter; but it's not\njust salmon; and it rarely is just salmon."},"1656":{"dur":3,"text":"It tends to be salmon along\nwith some of the other things"},"1659":{"dur":2,"text":"that you might expect, and\nthis is one for example."},"1662":{"dur":1,"text":"This is forest height diversity."},"1665":{"dur":3,"text":"We've known since about the 50's\nfrom Robert MacArthur's classic work"},"1668":{"dur":4,"text":"that forest height diversity is\nrelated to songbird abundance."},"1673":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a classic measurement."},"1674":{"dur":1,"text":"Ornithologists use it all the time."},"1676":{"dur":2,"text":"It just has to do with looking at\nthe different layers in the canopies"},"1679":{"dur":2,"text":"and calculating the overall\ndiversity of the canopy."},"1681":{"dur":6,"text":"So, this sort of makes sense that it would be,\nyou know, in these models as well as the salmon,"},"1687":{"dur":2,"text":"and so both are in these top models here."},"1691":{"dur":1,"text":"So, that's for diversity."},"1692":{"dur":0,"text":"So, it's not just salmon."},"1693":{"dur":1,"text":"I guess that's my point."},"1695":{"dur":3,"text":"I think it is certainly partly\nsalmon but not by themselves."},"1700":{"dur":4,"text":"So, then we were also quite\ninterested in plants."},"1705":{"dur":5,"text":"So, the first big push on this study was in\n2007, and so we got a crew of people together."},"1711":{"dur":2,"text":"Many people were doing different\nthings all at once here,"},"1714":{"dur":8,"text":"and we decided to try do some plant surveys\nto see if these might be involved with plants."},"1723":{"dur":4,"text":"First, I want to show you the only experiment\nthat I'm going to mention during this talk."},"1727":{"dur":5,"text":"This is one of our study areas; Ripley\nFalls it's called; it is a big waterfall;"},"1733":{"dur":4,"text":"it's right at the mouth of the river,\nand no salmon can jump this thing."},"1738":{"dur":2,"text":"There's no salmon habitat as\nyou can see down here, okay?"},"1740":{"dur":3,"text":"And you can see it's a pretty substantial thing."},"1745":{"dur":4,"text":"So, Morgan Hocking, postdoc guide, got the\nbright idea that we should put some salmon"},"1750":{"dur":2,"text":"up above it and see what happens to the plants."},"1753":{"dur":5,"text":"And so we went to a stream not even\nall that close, some distance away."},"1758":{"dur":5,"text":"We boated over to this other stream, got a whole\nbunch of rotten carcasses out of the water."},"1764":{"dur":2,"text":"So, these were truly disgusting carcasses"},"1766":{"dur":2,"text":"because without bait they'd be\nless likely to be scavenged."},"1769":{"dur":5,"text":"We put them in dripping plastic bags and\nthen hiked up over through the bush here"},"1774":{"dur":1,"text":"over this waterfall together, right?"},"1776":{"dur":3,"text":"And this was the point where Morgan\nstopped and said, \"Geez John,"},"1780":{"dur":2,"text":"I hope we don't win a Darwin\naward for this\", right?"},"1782":{"dur":4,"text":"[laughter] Because we've got these dead salmon\nin Grizzly bear country and they're big."},"1787":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, it was heavy."},"1788":{"dur":7,"text":"And so we did this there and we did it in\nten more streams and we laid out a series"},"1796":{"dur":2,"text":"of carcasses, usually about ten\nper stream, and here's how it went."},"1799":{"dur":6,"text":"You stick down a carcass and flag it and this\nis the kind of thing we were manipulating"},"1806":{"dur":3,"text":"and then we would take a sample of three\n-- up to three if we could find them --"},"1810":{"dur":3,"text":"three species of plants, which I'll call \"on\"."},"1814":{"dur":7,"text":"So, we take three species of plants\nright here foamflower, bunch berry,"},"1821":{"dur":4,"text":"and false lily of the valley,\nand also lanky moss --"},"1825":{"dur":2,"text":"which is the dominant moss\nthat carpets these areas."},"1827":{"dur":2,"text":"And so then we'd put down the carcass\nand then we'd go 2 metres away"},"1830":{"dur":2,"text":"and we take another sample of the same species."},"1833":{"dur":2,"text":"So, this is our before obviously, right?"},"1836":{"dur":1,"text":"We have the salmon."},"1838":{"dur":3,"text":"These should not be different from each\nother because we just put the salmon down."},"1841":{"dur":5,"text":"You go back in the spring; and, in fact, these\nhave had a total of eight months to sit there."},"1847":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, I thought I had a photograph of it."},"1849":{"dur":2,"text":"And when you come back, you\nfind just the skeleton"},"1851":{"dur":2,"text":"and nearly always the carcasses were still there"},"1854":{"dur":1,"text":"and you could tell they had been there\na long time because there is sort"},"1856":{"dur":4,"text":"of a burn area around them from the effect."},"1860":{"dur":2,"text":"So, we would go back in the spring\nand we would do it again, right,"},"1862":{"dur":5,"text":"sample them again after they had gone through\nthe fall, winter, and a good part of the spring."},"1868":{"dur":2,"text":"And here's just an example\nof the sort of results we had"},"1870":{"dur":4,"text":"for these three herbaceous plants'\npercent nitrogen in their leaves."},"1875":{"dur":3,"text":"So, in the fall the on and off was not\ndifferent and it should not have been"},"1878":{"dur":4,"text":"because the carcass had not worked its magic\nyet, and then in the spring there's this bounce"},"1883":{"dur":1,"text":"in the percent nitrogen in their leaves."},"1886":{"dur":2,"text":"There is a slight increase off the carcass too."},"1888":{"dur":3,"text":"Perhaps that's just a spring\ngrowth effect, right?"},"1892":{"dur":4,"text":"But with this before\/after control impact\nthing, we get a pretty clear signal here"},"1897":{"dur":3,"text":"that the plants are in fact showing\na nitrogen response as a result"},"1900":{"dur":3,"text":"of having had a salmon carcass placed\nbeside them, which is kind of interesting"},"1904":{"dur":6,"text":"because some botanists that we had spoken to\nwere doubtful that we would have such an effect"},"1911":{"dur":4,"text":"because most of this was not really\nhappening much through the growing season."},"1915":{"dur":5,"text":"Much of this was through the winter, but\nthere was some time certainly in the spring"},"1920":{"dur":1,"text":"for this growth effect to happen."},"1922":{"dur":1,"text":"So, the percent nitrogen went up."},"1923":{"dur":5,"text":"We had, interestingly, kind of\nvariable effects on the n15 signatures."},"1929":{"dur":1,"text":"Most of them went up."},"1930":{"dur":5,"text":"They actually went in both directions with\nour mosses, and we think we know why that was,"},"1936":{"dur":5,"text":"but at least it is some sort of evidence that\nthese plants might be taking up these nutrients"},"1942":{"dur":3,"text":"and incorporating them into their leaves."},"1946":{"dur":2,"text":"And here's an example -- This is\nthe lanky moss that I mentioned,"},"1949":{"dur":2,"text":"a very common moss, lily of the valley."},"1952":{"dur":6,"text":"And so here's salmon stream density here;\nand, again, it's sort of the on and off."},"1958":{"dur":5,"text":"So, the on -- that's this effect\nthat, you know, of higher percent n;"},"1964":{"dur":5,"text":"and you can see that if you have very few salmon\nin the stream, there's a bigger difference."},"1969":{"dur":1,"text":"There tends to be a bigger difference."},"1971":{"dur":3,"text":"So, these are the least nitrogen saturated."},"1974":{"dur":4,"text":"Here it's not having quite as much of a\ndifference, at least for this species."},"1980":{"dur":2,"text":"It's interesting; it is still\nhaving an effect on moss."},"1982":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm kind of surprised by that; but it suggests"},"1986":{"dur":3,"text":"that in the really nutrient-starved\nthings you might have more of an effect,"},"1990":{"dur":3,"text":"whereas these other ones that typically\nhave lots of salmon of their own coming."},"1993":{"dur":1,"text":"So, I showed you the control where\nthere had never been a salmon."},"1995":{"dur":2,"text":"We had lots of streams where\nthere were salmon and they tend"},"1998":{"dur":2,"text":"to differ somewhat in their responses."},"2001":{"dur":4,"text":"So, what I really cared about, though,\nwas the actual species that were there,"},"2005":{"dur":5,"text":"the species composition of the riparian\nplants; and so we threw some quadrats."},"2011":{"dur":6,"text":"We went to 50 streams and we ran a\ntransect 35 metres up the stream,"},"2017":{"dur":3,"text":"5 of them on each stream -- No, 6 of them."},"2022":{"dur":3,"text":"So, yeah, 6 of them -- 3 on\neach side -- 35 metres up."},"2026":{"dur":5,"text":"We quantified the percent cover of mosses,\nthe herb layer, and the shrub layer"},"2032":{"dur":2,"text":"and we also measured the diameter breast height"},"2035":{"dur":4,"text":"of over 6,000 trees all along the tape\n-- 5 metres each side of the tape."},"2039":{"dur":3,"text":"So, we had the forest plot sort of tree cover."},"2043":{"dur":1,"text":"This is Morgan here."},"2044":{"dur":4,"text":"So, we had the tree cover as well as the\nplant cover and we crunched this all together."},"2048":{"dur":5,"text":"We ended up with over 30,000 data entry\npoints just from the quadrat data alone"},"2055":{"dur":4,"text":"from across these 50 streams; and\nso we were going to ask, as usual,"},"2060":{"dur":2,"text":"how these might be related to the salmon."},"2062":{"dur":4,"text":"And we were able to predict beforehand which\nspecies might respond because there's a Handbook"},"2067":{"dur":5,"text":"of Forest Indicator Plants of B.C. and this\nwas done for forestry reasons and it's simply"},"2073":{"dur":3,"text":"because you could then diagnose,\nyou know, productivity of the forest"},"2077":{"dur":1,"text":"by looking at the species of plants."},"2078":{"dur":3,"text":"It had many, many things other\nthan just nitrogen indicators,"},"2082":{"dur":5,"text":"but from that we had this independent\na priori predictor where we were able"},"2087":{"dur":5,"text":"to array the species on a scale of how much\nthey would be nitrogen indicators or not."},"2093":{"dur":5,"text":"It's actually a continuous scale, but I'm\ngiving you two examples here of the extremes."},"2098":{"dur":3,"text":"So, lily of the valley, salmon,\nberry stink currant are examples"},"2102":{"dur":3,"text":"of nitrogen-rich indicators;\nwhereas things like salal

salmon."},"2230":{"dur":2,"text":"Another way to look at it is\nthe distance from the stream"},"2232":{"dur":5,"text":"because we actually threw our quadrats varying\ndistance; and so if you divide the streams"},"2237":{"dur":4,"text":"into low, medium, and high numbers of salmon,\nthis is simply showing the same thing."},"2243":{"dur":5,"text":"It flips toward the nitrogen-rich community;\nand if you look at the distance from the stream,"},"2249":{"dur":4,"text":"it's especially clear close to the stream bank,\nand the further you go from the stream bank"},"2253":{"dur":3,"text":"up 35 metres, the less of an effect you have."},"2257":{"dur":5,"text":"So, this effect is attenuating over the\n35 metres that we did our sampling, okay?"},"2262":{"dur":1,"text":"It's definitely attenuating."},"2263":{"dur":2,"text":"So, it doesn't go a long way."},"2267":{"dur":3,"text":"From other work we've done, these\nsalmon nutrients are probably not"},"2270":{"dur":5,"text":"in general going detectably more than\nabout 50 to 100 metres off the stream."},"2275":{"dur":6,"text":"And the interesting thing is that\nthere are some really neat interactions"},"2281":{"dur":1,"text":"that shape the responses\nbecause everything I showed you"},"2283":{"dur":2,"text":"in those graphs showed an\nawful lot of scatter, right?"},"2285":{"dur":6,"text":"A lot of scatter, and so we looked at whether\nthings are alder dominated or cedar dominated."},"2292":{"dur":3,"text":"So, this is the slope of the relationship\nthat you get in the stream community"},"2296":{"dur":5,"text":"in alder dominated versus cedar dominated\nstreams against stream salmon density."},"2301":{"dur":4,"text":"What this is saying is that whether\nyou have very few salmon or a ton"},"2306":{"dur":5,"text":"of salmon makes no difference to the\ncommunity if you have a lot of alders,"},"2312":{"dur":2,"text":"and that makes sense because alders,\nof course, are nitrogen fixers."},"2315":{"dur":4,"text":"So, these systems are not\nas salmon nutrient dependant"},"2320":{"dur":3,"text":"because there's an alternative\nsource of nitrogen from the alders."},"2323":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'll just mention the steep banks."},"2327":{"dur":1,"text":"Actually, let me just do it with a photo."},"2329":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that's the next shot."},"2331":{"dur":1,"text":"Steepness of the banks matters."},"2333":{"dur":5,"text":"If you have really steep banks here, you get no\ndetectable effect of the salmon on the community"},"2338":{"dur":5,"text":"of plants, and it makes sense because the bears\nare not going to come down these banks to hunt"},"2344":{"dur":3,"text":"and if they did leave a carcass lying\naround, the carcass won't stay there;"},"2348":{"dur":4,"text":"and so if you have steep banks,\nthat doesn't have much of an effect."},"2353":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's that alder effect."},"2354":{"dur":6,"text":"These kinds of streams are basically insensitive\nto what we're getting from these nutrients."},"2361":{"dur":5,"text":"So, as I mentioned to a couple of people this\nmorning, I sort of felt once Morgan Hocking,"},"2367":{"dur":3,"text":"the postdoc who led this research, once\nhe started showing me those analyses,"},"2371":{"dur":3,"text":"I started to actually think we might\nhave it because you always worry"},"2375":{"dur":2,"text":"about a correlative study; but in\nsome censuses these are exceptions"},"2378":{"dur":5,"text":"that help I think prove the rule that there are\nsome sensible correlates of the overall effect."},"2383":{"dur":2,"text":"And the effect goes away\nin certain types of streams"},"2386":{"dur":2,"text":"where you would actually\npredict that it might go away."},"2389":{"dur":4,"text":"And then the last thing I want to say about\nplants is a recent project that we did led"},"2393":{"dur":3,"text":"by Leslie Hurteau, and this was also\nin collaboration with Morgan Hocking"},"2397":{"dur":4,"text":"and Arne Mooers in our department; and\nwe looked at phylogenetic filtering."},"2402":{"dur":5,"text":"So, the idea here is that if you have very\nfew salmon, there may be only certain types"},"2407":{"dur":1,"text":"of plants that are able to thrive there."},"2409":{"dur":5,"text":"And in particular these would be species that\nhave mycorrhizal relationships with their roots"},"2414":{"dur":2,"text":"and which enable them to take\nup inorganic forms of nitrogen."},"2418":{"dur":3,"text":"On the other hand, if you have a lot of\nsalmon, that might leave room for other species"},"2422":{"dur":5,"text":"to potentially come into play, species that are\nnot necessarily closely related to each other."},"2428":{"dur":4,"text":"These might all tend to be ericaceous shrubs,\nfor example, which have those characteristics;"},"2433":{"dur":5,"text":"whereas species you could have a much\nmore dispersed phylogenetic tree."},"2438":{"dur":5,"text":"So, the idea would be that lack of salmon\ncould cause a filtering of your phylogeny"},"2443":{"dur":2,"text":"and a more clumped phylogenetic tree."},"2446":{"dur":4,"text":"So, we put together a phylogenetic tree\nof about 65 species of vascular plants"},"2451":{"dur":3,"text":"from our analysis and here it is."},"2454":{"dur":1,"text":"So, here's the salmon density."},"2456":{"dur":4,"text":"Each dot is a different stream,\nand this shows you how clustered"},"2460":{"dur":6,"text":"or dispersed the phylogenetic distribution\nof the species in the community is"},"2466":{"dur":5,"text":"and that is the effect we get, that we\nget a greater dispersion at high numbers."},"2472":{"dur":2,"text":"You can see it's not exactly a monotonic."},"2474":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean the scatter is enormous here, and\nperhaps that's not surprising in light"},"2478":{"dur":4,"text":"of what we've learnt about what controls these\nplant communities; but once we get out here,"},"2483":{"dur":5,"text":"it's a fairly consistently more dispersed\nphylogenetic assemblage of plants"},"2489":{"dur":6,"text":"on these streams, even though the\noverall species diversity can go down."},"2496":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I'll just summarize some of these\nhighlights before we think a little bit"},"2501":{"dur":3,"text":"about what we could do with this if we wanted to\ngo on to the next step, which we haven't taken"},"2504":{"dur":3,"text":"yet but I am interested in doing."},"2508":{"dur":1,"text":"I haven't mentioned this."},"2509":{"dur":0,"text":"We get variable effects."},"2510":{"dur":4,"text":"They do actually scour out the\nphytoplankton, though it takes up nutrients."},"2514":{"dur":3,"text":"Variable effects here; we saw,\nagain, it takes up the nutrients."},"2517":{"dur":4,"text":"These bugs take up nutrients but they\ncan actually decrease; and, in fact,"},"2522":{"dur":3,"text":"we've done this research in\nthe Fraser River and found"},"2525":{"dur":2,"text":"in that study that they actually can increase."},"2527":{"dur":3,"text":"So, we're not quite sure what\nthe bottom line is for insects."},"2531":{"dur":6,"text":"We saw positive effects on relationships\nat least with the density of these"},"2537":{"dur":1,"text":"and we've also found it with growth"},"2539":{"dur":2,"text":"and I haven't mentioned sculpins\nbut they had the same response."},"2542":{"dur":4,"text":"And on land we've seen all sorts of correlates\nhere with the plants, scavengers, and songbirds."},"2546":{"dur":5,"text":"What would you do with this if we wanted\nto look at ecosystem based management?"},"2553":{"dur":1,"text":"Here's Canada's wild salmon policy."},"2554":{"dur":1,"text":"It was published in 2005."},"2556":{"dur":2,"text":"This thing probably had one\nof the most painful gestations"},"2559":{"dur":1,"text":"of any document ever produced by government."},"2560":{"dur":6,"text":"It took them nearly 10 years of public\nconsultations to say what are salmon for?"},"2567":{"dur":2,"text":"What do we want to do with salmon management?"},"2570":{"dur":1,"text":"And this involved lots of meetings."},"2571":{"dur":1,"text":"This was all before my time on the west coast."},"2573":{"dur":1,"text":"I was living in England at the time."},"2576":{"dur":4,"text":"And they had all sorts of meetings with\nfirst nations people, various stakeholders"},"2581":{"dur":8,"text":"such as fishermen and anglers and members of\nthe public, and it's a very good document."},"2589":{"dur":5,"text":"I think it sets out a very nice blueprint for\nthe objectives of managing west coast salmon;"},"2594":{"dur":5,"text":"and it says, \"A challenge is the need\nfor development of an ecosystem objective"},"2600":{"dur":5,"text":"that is widely appreciated but difficult\nto quantify\" because it acknowledges"},"2605":{"dur":3,"text":"that we should probably not just be\nmanaging salmon for our own fisheries --"},"2610":{"dur":2,"text":"whether Aboriginal, commercial,\nor recreational --"},"2612":{"dur":2,"text":"but also for these wider ecosystem objectives,"},"2615":{"dur":2,"text":"which ten years ago we kind\nof knew they were important."},"2617":{"dur":2,"text":"We knew that Grizzly bears ate salmon of course."},"2620":{"dur":3,"text":"But as it says, it was very\ndifficult to quantify."},"2624":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, I've spent some time now quantifying them."},"2626":{"dur":4,"text":"I've shown you lots of quantifications\nof relationships between salmon"},"2631":{"dur":3,"text":"and various potential ecosystem\nobjectives, okay?"},"2634":{"dur":3,"text":"And it said few studies at the time\nprovided the \"advice on the number"},"2638":{"dur":2,"text":"of salmon necessary for healthy ecosystems.\""},"2641":{"dur":1,"text":"It was a very clever document."},"2642":{"dur":1,"text":"They didn't try to define healthy."},"2644":{"dur":1,"text":"Good thing; that could have\nbeen another ten years."},"2646":{"dur":1,"text":"We know one when we see one, right?"},"2648":{"dur":1,"text":"Whatever it means, it doesn't matter."},"2650":{"dur":1,"text":"The point is the objective was there."},"2651":{"dur":2,"text":"It was a blueprint for an aspiration."},"2654":{"dur":4,"text":"I wouldn't have tried to identify\nwhat that means exactly either."},"2659":{"dur":1,"text":"So, let's see what that might look like."},"2661":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're going to bring that into\nthe world of fisheries management,"},"2663":{"dur":2,"text":"which is the way we currently\nare doing business."},"2665":{"dur":3,"text":"So, let's just look at a\ntypical yield curve here."},"2669":{"dur":1,"text":"This could be for any fishery."},"2671":{"dur":5,"text":"You have the number of salmon\ngoing from zero to maximum."},"2677":{"dur":3,"text":"So, this implies that there's no catch."},"2681":{"dur":3,"text":"So, they're all getting back and spawning, and\nthis implies that you're catching them all,"},"2685":{"dur":1,"text":"and most of the fisheries are happening at sea."},"2687":{"dur":3,"text":"So, certainly they're happening\nbefore the spawning grounds."},"2690":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you do that, you can see\nthere's obviously a tradeoff."},"2693":{"dur":5,"text":"If you let them all get back, your yield to\nthe fishery is zero; and if there aren't any,"},"2698":{"dur":1,"text":"you're not going to get a yield either;"},"2700":{"dur":5,"text":"and this is our classic maximum sustainable\nyield tradeoff; and in this particular case,"},"2705":{"dur":3,"text":"if the curve is shaped like this, this\nwould be what you would shoot for."},"2709":{"dur":3,"text":"That would be your target if you're trying\nto maximize the yield to the fishery."},"2713":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay. Now what would an ecosystem look like?"},"2718":{"dur":1,"text":"What would a bear's eye view of this be?"},"2720":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, if there's no salmon, that's not\nvery much of a yield to the ecosystem"},"2724":{"dur":3,"text":"around the spawning ground either\nand it may well be, though,"},"2728":{"dur":2,"text":"that the ecosystem yield is\ngoing to be maximized way"},"2731":{"dur":2,"text":"out here, not where we maximize it, okay?"},"2734":{"dur":3,"text":"This is our zone of conflict here, right,\nif we're going to decide are the fish"},"2737":{"dur":2,"text":"for us or are they there for the bears."},"2740":{"dur":2,"text":"So, from a bear's eye view, your EBM --"},"2743":{"dur":3,"text":"your ecosystem based management\n-- target would be here, okay?"},"2746":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is our zone between the two extremes."},"2749":{"dur":2,"text":"That's our zone where we\nhave to make a decision."},"2751":{"dur":3,"text":"We have to decide on a tradeoff, whether we\nmean it that we're really going to, you know,"},"2755":{"dur":2,"text":"give up some fish for these other objectives."},"2758":{"dur":2,"text":"Now if bears were the only thing we\ncared about, we could do this right now"},"2761":{"dur":4,"text":"because this work has been done partly\nby researchers in Alaska and partly"},"2765":{"dur":4,"text":"by Chris Darimont and colleagues at U Vic."},"2770":{"dur":6,"text":"We can actually do this for bears pretty\neasily, but is that what we care about?"},"2776":{"dur":3,"text":"What if another species has a\ndifferent looking yield curve?"},"2780":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean maybe if this were\nwhat eagles looked like,"},"2783":{"dur":1,"text":"well then they have much less of a conflict."},"2785":{"dur":4,"text":"So, if we wanted to maximize for eagles,\nwe might have less of a tradeoff,"},"2789":{"dur":2,"text":"but then we're not doing the bears\nany favours because we're here."},"2792":{"dur":5,"text":"So, you see the problem is that I've\njust shown you probably 12 or so,"},"2797":{"dur":6,"text":"maybe 15 of these curves -- exactly these\ncurves where numbers of salmon versus effect"},"2803":{"dur":3,"text":"of some sort on an ecosystem; and the\nquestion is, \"Where do they all end up?\""},"2807":{"dur":1,"text":"Do they end up in the same place?"},"2810":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, I'm not the only one doing this."},"2811":{"dur":4,"text":"Tom Reimchen's group, for example, a\nnumber of years ago looked at, you know,"},"2816":{"dur":5,"text":"Carabid ground beetles and pitfall traps beside\nsome streams, and here's the n15 signature"},"2822":{"dur":2,"text":"in those in the salmon per metre squared."},"2824":{"dur":4,"text":"Now an ecosystem objective -- I know that\nthe public probably isn't deeply concerned"},"2828":{"dur":1,"text":"that the Carabids have a high n15."},"2830":{"dur":3,"text":"That might not be quite the\ntarget, but maybe it's an indicator."},"2834":{"dur":3,"text":"Maybe it's an indicator,\nnot necessarily the target,"},"2837":{"dur":2,"text":"but it's an indicator of that kind of a target."},"2840":{"dur":3,"text":"So, we went through the literature and we\nlooked at all of our cases, all the other ones,"},"2843":{"dur":4,"text":"and we went through some very painful\nstandardization exercises of trying"},"2848":{"dur":2,"text":"to get this axis to be the same because even"},"2851":{"dur":2,"text":"in my talk I've shown you several\ndifferent metrics for this."},"2854":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you put it all together,\nthis is what we get."},"2856":{"dur":2,"text":"If you wanted to look for\nmaximum ecological impact"},"2859":{"dur":2,"text":"so that basically where's the\nasymptote on those curves?"},"2863":{"dur":3,"text":"Some don't have an asymptote, okay?"},"2867":{"dur":5,"text":"So, if you take the examples of n15\nsignals in all kinds of things, okay --"},"2872":{"dur":6,"text":"bugs, plants, and so on -- you can see that\nhere are the number of studies that show"},"2879":{"dur":2,"text":"that you can actually maximize\nit just above zero."},"2881":{"dur":2,"text":"That doesn't mean literally\nzero but just above zero."},"2884":{"dur":4,"text":"So, there are six in that category and\nthree more here and a couple more at five."},"2888":{"dur":5,"text":"In other words, it seems like\nthese indicators tend to max"},"2894":{"dur":2,"text":"out very soon, smallish numbers of salmon."},"2897":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I'm not actually sure,\nunfortunately, that this is a great way"},"2900":{"dur":1,"text":"that you could diagnose the\nhealth of your stream."},"2902":{"dur":3,"text":"You can't just take the leaves off\nthe salmon berry or what have you"},"2906":{"dur":3,"text":"because they tend to max out fairly quickly."},"2909":{"dur":5,"text":"If you take some studies of birds, we've\nbeen pushing this a lot further now."},"2914":{"dur":3,"text":"I've had two more graduate students working\non birds that I haven't told you about,"},"2918":{"dur":3,"text":"but those are just two examples of studies."},"2921":{"dur":5,"text":"There's one on periphyton actually,\nand there's a bear study and so on."},"2927":{"dur":2,"text":"The thing is that they're\nall over the map, okay?"},"2930":{"dur":4,"text":"And this is partly I think because there are\ndifferent species that have different biology."},"2935":{"dur":2,"text":"It's partly because different\nstreams have different capacities"},"2937":{"dur":1,"text":"for how many salmon they could support anyway."},"2939":{"dur":4,"text":"There is not necessarily one metric of density."},"2944":{"dur":4,"text":"And so I think where we are now -- and this is\nactually an area that I'm now starting to get"},"2949":{"dur":3,"text":"into -- is to think carefully about the\nscale of the management and the tradeoffs"},"2953":{"dur":2,"text":"that would be involved under\ndifferent scenarios."},"2956":{"dur":7,"text":"And so I began by asking the question what were\nthe, you know, ecosystem impacts of salmon."},"2963":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, there are clearly quite a lot of them,\nand I think they could translate into management"},"2969":{"dur":4,"text":"if people decide on both the targets\nand the tradeoffs to tie these together,"},"2974":{"dur":4,"text":"and that's very much what a number of agencies\nare now saying that we need to be doing,"},"2978":{"dur":3,"text":"and I'm hoping that that will perhaps\nbe sort of phase two of our research."},"2982":{"dur":3,"text":"I think the ecology was kind of the\neasy part, although it didn't seem"},"2985":{"dur":4,"text":"so when I was carrying a transect tape\nup a muddy bank in the pouring rain,"},"2990":{"dur":3,"text":"but now we also need very much to\nmove more toward the management side,"},"2994":{"dur":1,"text":"including people in these equations."},"2996":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I just want to mention,\nbecause I hope it was pretty clear,"},"2998":{"dur":2,"text":"that an awful lot of people\nwere involved in this study."},"3001":{"dur":1,"text":"This is a snapshot in time."},"3003":{"dur":3,"text":"There have been other graduate students\ncoming and going through this program."},"3007":{"dur":5,"text":"I particularly wanted to acknowledge the\nHeiltsuk First Nation, who have allowed us"},"3013":{"dur":1,"text":"to work in their territory\nand to work with them."},"3015":{"dur":6,"text":"It has been in
