formal system."},"71":{"dur":2,"text":"At the jirga, the men sat together"},"74":{"dur":2,"text":"and they decided that the \nbest way to satisfy the debt"},"77":{"dur":4,"text":"would be if Naghma married\nthe neighbor's 21-year-old son."},"81":{"dur":2,"text":"She was six."},"84":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, stories like Naghma's unfortunately"},"86":{"dur":1,"text":"are all too

followed,"},"111":{"dur":1,"text":"and it goes without saying"},"112":{"dur":2,"text":"that giving a child to satisfy a debt"},"115":{"dur":4,"text":"is not only grossly immoral, it's illegal."},"119":{"dur":2,"text":"In 2008, I went to Afghanistan"},"122":{"dur":2,"text":"for a justice funded program,"},"124":{"dur":2,"text":"and I went there originally \non this nine-month program"},"127":{"dur":1,"text":"to train Afghan lawyers."},"129":{"dur":2,"text":"In that nine months, I went around the country"},"131":{"dur":2,"text":"and I talked to hundreds of\npeople that were locked up,"},"134":{"dur":1,"text":"and I talked to many businesses"},"135":{"dur":2,"text":"that were also operating in Afghanistan."},"138":{"dur":1,"text":"And within these conversations,"},"139":{"dur":1,"text":"I started hearing the connections"},"141":{"dur":1,"text":"between the businesses and the people,"},"143":{"dur":2,"text":"and how laws that were meant to protect them"},"145":{"dur":1,"text":"were being underused,"},"147":{"dur":4,"text":"while gross and illegal punitive\nmeasures were overused."},"151":{"dur":2,"text":"And so this put me on a quest

protect."},"163":{"dur":3,"text":"The role of laws is to protect."},"166":{"dur":3,"text":"So as a result, I decided to \nopen up a private practice,"},"170":{"dur":2,"text":"and I became the first

people,"},"179":{"dur":1,"text":"I read up on many cases,"},"180":{"dur":2,"text":"and I found that the lack of justness"},"182":{"dur":1,"text":"is not just a problem in Afghanistan,"},"184":{"dur":2,"text":"but it's a global problem."},"187":{"dur":1,"text":"And while I originally shied away from"},"188":{"dur":2,"text":"representing human rights cases"},"190":{"dur":2,"text":"because I was really concerned about how it would"},"193":{"dur":2,"text":"affect me both professionally and personally,"},"195":{"dur":2,"text":"I decided that the need for justness was so great"},"198":{"dur":1,"text":"that I couldn't continue to ignore it."},"200":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I started representing people like Naghma"},"202":{"dur":2,"text":"pro bono also."},"205":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, since I've been in Afghanistan"},"206":{"dur":2,"text":"and since I've been an attorney for over 10 years,"},"209":{"dur":3,"text":"I've represented from CEOs \nof

very simple:"},"219":{"dur":2,"text":"I work the system from the inside out"},"221":{"dur":1,"text":"and use the laws in the ways"},"223":{"dur":2,"text":"that they're intended to be used."},"225":{"dur":2,"text":"I find that"},"228":{"dur":3,"text":"achieving justness in places like Afghanistan"},"231":{"dur":2,"text":"is difficult, and there's three reasons."},"233":{"dur":2,"text":"The first reason is that simply put,"},"236":{"dur":3,"text":"people are very uneducated as\nto what their legal rights were,"},"239":{"dur":2,"text":"and I find that this is a global problem."},"241":{"dur":1,"text":"The second issue"},"243":{"dur":3,"text":"is that even with laws on the books,"},"246":{"dur":2,"text":"it's often superseded or ignored"},"248":{"dur":2,"text":"by tribal customs, like in the first jirga"},"251":{"dur":1,"text":"that sold Naghma off."},"252":{"dur":2,"text":"And the third problem with achieving justness"},"255":{"dur":2,"text":"is that even with good, existing laws on the books,"},"258":{"dur":2,"text":"there aren't people or lawyers \nthat are willing to fight"},"260":{"dur":1,"text":"for those laws."},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's what I do: I use existing laws,"},"265":{"dur":1,"text":"often unused laws,"},"267":{"dur":3,"text":"and I work those to the benefits of my clients."},"270":{"dur":2,"text":"We all need to create a global culture"},"273":{"dur":1,"text":"of human rights"},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"and be investors in a global \nhuman rights economy,"},"277":{"dur":1,"text":"and by working in this mindset,"},"279":{"dur":2,"text":"we can significantly improve justice globally."},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"Now let's get back to Naghma."},"284":{"dur":2,"text":"Several people heard about this story,"},"287":{"dur":1,"text":"and so they contacted me because they wanted"},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"to pay the $2,500 debt."},"291":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's not just that simple;"},"293":{"dur":1,"text":"you can't just throw money at this problem"},"294":{"dur":1,"text":"and think that it's going to disappear."},"296":{"dur":2,"text":"That's not how it works in Afghanistan."},"298":{"dur":3,"text":"So I told them I'd get involved,"},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"but in order to get involved, \nwhat needed to happen"},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"is a second jirga needed to be called,"},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"a jirga of appeals."},"309":{"dur":2,"text":"And so in order for that to happen,"},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"we needed to get the village elders together,"},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"we needed to get the tribal leaders together,"},"316":{"dur":1,"text":"the religious leaders."},"318":{"dur":1,"text":"Naghma's father needed to agree,"},"319":{"dur":1,"text":"the neighbor needed to agree,"},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"and also his son needed to agree."},"323":{"dur":4,"text":"And I thought, if I'm going to \nget involved in this thing,"},"327":{"dur":3,"text":"then they also need to agree \nthat I preside over it."},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"So, after hours of talking"},"333":{"dur":1,"text":"and tracking them down,"},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"and about 30 cups of tea,"},"337":{"dur":1,"text":"they finally agreed that we could sit down"},"339":{"dur":3,"text":"for a second jirga, and we did."},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"And what was different about the second jirga"},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"is this time, we put the law at the center of it,"},"347":{"dur":1,"text":"and it was very important for me"},"349":{"dur":1,"text":"that they all understood that Naghma"},"350":{"dur":2,"text":"had a right to be protected."},"353":{"dur":1,"text":"And at the end of this jirga,"},"354":{"dur":2,"text":"it was ordered by the judge"},"356":{"dur":3,"text":"that the first decision was erased,"},"360":{"dur":3,"text":"and that the $2,500 debt was satisfied,"},"364":{"dur":1,"text":"and we all signed a written order"},"366":{"dur":1,"text":"where all the men acknowledged"},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"that what they did was illegal,"},"369":{"dur":4,"text":"and if they did it again, that \nthey would go to prison."},"374":{"dur":1,"text":"Most \u2014"},"376":{"dur":1,"text":"(Applause)"},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"Thanks."},"379":{"dur":1,"text":"And most importantly,"},"381":{"dur":1,"text":"the engagement was

take,"},"415":{"dur":1,"text":"my clients take far greater risks,"},"417":{"dur":1,"text":"because they have a lot more to lose"},"419":{"dur":1,"text":"if their cases go
