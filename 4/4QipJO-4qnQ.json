Then we've got how-to tutorials, so very straightforward you know"},"1301":{"dur":5,"text":"it's the dude click here to go do that, here's how to use Magic Canvas in TouchSmart."},"1308":{"dur":3,"text":"Then we've got product or technology overviews."},"1311":{"dur":6,"text":"So these types of videos are trying to take away where a document \u2013 you know it's very hard"},"1317":{"dur":4,"text":"to explain how something like Intel Smart Response Technology works in words."},"1322":{"dur":3,"text":"People are reading those words and it may not make a lot of sense but what we can do"},"1325":{"dur":3,"text":"in the video as we see that technology and we say, okay,"},"1328":{"dur":4,"text":"within this computer there's actually two different drives and we can explode that out and show"},"1333":{"dur":4,"text":"how different drives are talking to each other in order to make this product work better."},"1337":{"dur":4,"text":"So then people come out, they see this and they go \u201cHey this is great. Now I get it."},"1341":{"dur":3,"text":"Now I see why I should be doing this and how to use it on my PC.\u201d"},"1345":{"dur":5,"text":"So it's a great visual way to represent things that are very difficult in documents."},"1350":{"dur":4,"text":"And then we have the troubleshooting. So like troubleshooting your webcam this one"},"1354":{"dur":4,"text":"gets a lot of use. People are using Skype or MSN or something and then you know"},"1359":{"dur":4,"text":"it doesn't work. The webcam is pulling up and saying, turn it on. So we have these videos"},"1364":{"dur":4,"text":"that go through step-by-step. Step one, you know, isolating where the problem occurs."},"1368":{"dur":2,"text":"So you got to start at the top like what is the real problem."},"1371":{"dur":2,"text":"And we have a bunch of these videos that go through that type of thing."},"1375":{"dur":2,"text":"Then this one is a little bit newer, show-me-how,"},"1377":{"dur":2,"text":"and what these are is a very small little video,"},"1380":{"dur":4,"text":"no audio that goes right in the middle of a document with the steps."},"1384":{"dur":4,"text":"And what this is is picture in the Harry Potter newspaper you know it's not a screenshot,"},"1389":{"dur":4,"text":"right, it's not a static image it's a moving image that goes with the story that you're reading."},"1393":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's exactly what this is.

You just click play and it shows you exactly what these"},"1402":{"dur":4,"text":"steps in the document say. So you could print out the document and then watch this as well."},"1407":{"dur":5,"text":"And then we've got these that I like to call edutainment. So we tried hiring actors,"},"1413":{"dur":4,"text":"very high production and having support scenarios kind of built into the plot or some kind"},"1417":{"dur":5,"text":"of comical scenario. And we've got a few of these that are out there. And this is a part of"},"1423":{"dur":3,"text":"our past and learning this you know what works well and what doesn't."},"1427":{"dur":5,"text":"So we're moving more now towards this YouTube style where the Kevin and Randy thing"},"1432":{"dur":5,"text":"is kind of a webisode where we have a person who is an expert from HP or maybe"},"1438":{"dur":5,"text":"a blogger or something on-screen talking to you just as a normal person explaining something,"},"1443":{"dur":4,"text":"troubleshooting something. They are very educational style it's not like the tutorial"},"1447":{"dur":4,"text":"like click here, do this, do that.

Well these types of videos explain that."},"1467":{"dur":4,"text":"So now you see we've got a bunch different videos, where are they at?"},"1471":{"dur":3,"text":"Well we go where the action is we go where you are. So we have them on HP"},"1475":{"dur":2,"text":"but we also have them in YouTube. And you can see here in the URL,"},"1478":{"dur":3,"text":"I personally watch this YouTube channel, reply to the comments,"},"1481":{"dur":5,"text":"read every single comment that comes in on our videos and that's at the youtube.com\/howto4u."},"1486":{"dur":6,"text":"And then for some of the Chinese as well because in China you cannot reach YouTube so we have"},"1493":{"dur":4,"text":"a Youku account where we have a subset of our videos that had been translated into Chinese."},"1499":{"dur":3,"text":"And then as Randy showed in our documents we embed them in the documents."},"1502":{"dur":4,"text":"And this is really important for search and for other things where a video may not come up"},"1506":{"dur":5,"text":"in Google as easy because it doesn't have all the rich text that a document does so here the"},"1512":{"dur":4,"text":"document is working for us to pull up this in search and then you got the video in there too."},"1517":{"dur":4,"text":"And then we got for the more commercial side. I know we've been very consumer-focused"},"1522":{"dur":6,"text":"but for people working with workstations and high-end PCs there is the Service Media"},"1528":{"dur":7,"text":"Library so it's hp.com\/go\/sml and has all the hardware service videos for the commercial PCs."},"1537":{"dur":4,"text":"Then we also have the video support gallery and this is something that Ben over here \u2013 I work"},"1541":{"dur":2,"text":"with him as well as on the printing side he and I have been working a lot in trying"},"1544":{"dur":5,"text":"to get this built out. And what this is a \u2013 you know it's kind of a user interface similar"},"1549":{"dur":5,"text":"to YouTube but not exact and then it's got categories so you can go in and say I want look at"},"1554":{"dur":4,"text":"printing or computing and then I want to look at say in computing I want to look at recovery"},"1558":{"dur":2,"text":"and it will pull up all of the videos we've made on recovery."},"1561":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's very easy to target and find the videos you are looking for."},"1565":{"dur":4,"text":"And then we also \u2013 we don't publish to Twitter but we use Twitter to send out and"},"1569":{"dur":2,"text":"popularize our videos. We want customers to know about them, right."},"1572":{"dur":4,"text":"We spent all this time on video and video takes a lot of work it's not like a document that"},"1577":{"dur":3,"text":"you can change a few words and republish, this takes a lot of time to edit and"},"1580":{"dur":4,"text":"once it's there it's kind of set. So we like to get money out of \u2013 or get something"},"1585":{"dur":3,"text":"out of that investment and send them out through Twitter and other places."},"1588":{"dur":4,"text":"And we also link into apps that are on the product. So when Windows 8 came out"},"1592":{"dur":3,"text":"we created a whole series of tutorials and we've even created a Kevin and Randy show on"},"1596":{"dur":5,"text":"how to use Windows 8. And those videos we worked with the application software developers"},"1602":{"dur":3,"text":"and the engineers to link our videos and the documents that Randy mentioned earlier"},"1605":{"dur":3,"text":"into this application. So it looks different than it looks on Customer Care"},"1609":{"dur":3,"text":"but it's actually the exact same content and viewable through your PC."},"1613":{"dur":5,"text":"So now why do we create them? It's evolution baby. This is just a good excuse for me"},"1619":{"dur":5,"text":"use a Pearl Jam lyric but really it's about evolution, right. In the beginning you have words,"},"1624":{"dur":3,"text":"people reading product manuals, then you maybe had some help in your software,"},"1628":{"dur":3,"text":"people are just reading these manuals and then trying to make things work."},"1632":{"dur":5,"text":"Then we got pictures, people start adding in screenshots and then some photos and maybe"},"1637":{"dur":3,"text":"some animated gifs kind of showing key actions."},"1641":{"dur":5,"text":"So you can see the progress of communication was developing and evolving on its own."},"1646":{"dur":3,"text":"And so then we got to video and at first you have professional videos."},"1650":{"dur":5,"text":"There are a whole lot of high quality good cameras, very expensive and then home video"},"1655":{"dur":3,"text":"started coming out and more, more people got hold of these home video cameras"},"1659":{"dur":5,"text":"and then YouTube came along. And YouTube really changed the industry and communication"},"1664":{"dur":4,"text":"so they made it so anyone can upload video any time and that took away the whole need to"},"1668":{"dur":3,"text":"have high production value because when you're willing to sit and watch somebody"},"1672":{"dur":5,"text":"who's looking in to their webcam explain something then you probably don't need to spend"},"1678":{"dur":3,"text":"thousands of dollars on hiring an actor to do the exact same thing."},"1681":{"dur":4,"text":"So YouTube changed the whole way that we talk to each other, how customers talk us, how we talk"},"1686":{"dur":3,"text":"to them and so we've kind of got to go in that same style because that's what they expect."},"1691":{"dur":5,"text":"So some facts: We can't really go back, video is here. We need to progress with it."},"1696":{"dur":6,"text":"People love watching videos. So in the US alone this is in \u2013 this is January 2013 data,"},"1703":{"dur":4,"text":"the average viewer in the US spends 19 hours per month watching online videos."},"1707":{"dur":4,"text":"It's a lot of time watching videos.

So we've created over 4,000 videos across"},"1723":{"dur":4,"text":"20 languages on customer care. We get over a million views on those every month"},"1728":{"dur":3,"text":"and we have about 2,500 support documents containing these videos"},"1732":{"dur":3,"text":"so obviously a lot of eyeballs around these videos."},"1735":{"dur":4,"text":"And then we have in YouTube, we have about 2,500 videos across the 20 languages as well."},"1740":{"dur":5,"text":"So it's not just our English YouTube we also have localized YouTube sites that the regions"},"1746":{"dur":2,"text":"are working with and posting the translated versions of these."},"1748":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you work in the other language forums you may be hearing about me talking"},"1752":{"dur":5,"text":"the English side but there is a generally one for your languages well."},"1757":{"dur":2,"text":"And we get about 500,000 views per month."},"1760":{"dur":7,"text":"And if you look at that we got about 4,000 videos in customer care, 2,500 in YouTube,"},"1767":{"dur":3,"text":"we're getting about a million and a half to two million views across those two channels."},"1771":{"dur":0,"text":"It's pretty amazing."},"1773":{"dur":4,"text":"And now what do we learned? We've created all these videos and we're still creating,"},"1777":{"dur":3,"text":"have we learned anything? Have we evolved with the technology?"},"1780":{"dur":4,"text":"Well things we've learned so far is that videos can be easier to understand especially"},"1785":{"dur":3,"text":"when they're done well. Obviously if you make a bad video it's not going to help"},"1788":{"dur":5,"text":"anyone but video, a visual representation can help you. It builds confidence for the user."},"1794":{"dur":5,"text":"So a person may be sitting there reading the document \u201cI don't know if I could replace"},"1800":{"dur":4,"text":"that hard drive myself.

I just unscrew this, pull this out,"},"1808":{"dur":3,"text":"wow, that's simple.\u201d So they become confident and willing to do things themselves"},"1812":{"dur":2,"text":"which obviously helps them and it helps us because"},"1815":{"dur":2,"text":"we're not having to have them frustrated with their product."},"1819":{"dur":3,"text":"But one size doesn't fit all. So some people may think well why don't you just do all your"},"1822":{"dur":5,"text":"videos the same? It's like I said earlier no tool \u2013 not all tools are hammers."},"1827":{"dur":4,"text":"Some things have different reasons. There are many different people that are out here,"},"1832":{"dur":3,"text":"they have different tastes.

Hey, cool. That's always a good feeling to know that somebody is watching."},"1934":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'm going to give you a little bit of the behind-the-scenes, where we started from"},"1938":{"dur":3,"text":"and how we got there.

So we're over here fighting for the users"},"1959":{"dur":4,"text":"and we see that people are frustrated with their product so we want to jump in and change that."},"1965":{"dur":4,"text":"So we started out a long time ago in the year 2000,"},"1969":{"dur":4,"text":"we were seeing a lot of comments coming in where people are saying \u201cI can't upgrade"},"1973":{"dur":6,"text":"my hard drive\u201d \u201cI can't upgrade memory\u201d and so I went \u201cAll right, we got a video camera.\u201d"},"1980":{"dur":4,"text":"Somebody had a home video camera and we literally just went \u201cOkay, let's just a desk.\u201d"},"1984":{"dur":4,"text":"and I grabbed Randy.
