that?"},"368":{"dur":5,"text":"I mean, don't we normally want the people we know, and are affiliated with, to be saved?"},"374":{"dur":6,"text":"So why does Paul suspect that some in this church in

forth the doctrines of election and salvation further back there."},"523":{"dur":1,"text":"And so, if we really understand those,"},"525":{"dur":5,"text":"then the way this applies to us is that the

it's a natural thing, is it not?"},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"That when you come to Christ for salvation,"},"614":{"dur":5,"text":"you want your loved ones (those who are closest to you beforehand) to be

not have even a trace of contempt or bitterness"},"1061":{"dur":4,"text":"towards these people who mistreated him so badly"},"1066":{"dur":4,"text":"was because he knew where they were heading, and he would put himself in their shoes."},"1070":{"dur":5,"text":"And Paul never forgot what he was like before the Lord called him."},"1075":{"dur":7,"text":"He knew that if it wasn't for the grace of God,

religious Pharisees than anyone else in the New Testament."},"1187":{"dur":3,"text":"You see, I want you to notice here,"},"1191":{"dur":4,"text":"that Paul, after the way his fellow countrymen treated him,"},"1196":{"dur":2,"text":"he had every right to be offended."},"1198":{"dur":5,"text":"And yet, sometimes we cut people off over something or nothing."},"1204":{"dur":2,"text":"But he does not despise them or cut them off."},"1206":{"dur":4,"text":"Again, there's no trace of contempt or scorn."},"1211":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, how does this apply in our

react?"},"1227":{"dur":5,"text":"What if someone does something you find offensive in your school or your college?"},"1233":{"dur":4,"text":"What if someone in your family does something you recoil

Him."},"1322":{"dur":3,"text":"You see, my point is this: If your Calvinism --"},"1326":{"dur":5,"text":"if your understanding of those types of doctrines like election and predestination --"},"1332":{"dur":2,"text":"if they do not produce in you a burden for the lost,"},"1334":{"dur":6,"text":"then it is just head knowledge, detached from spiritual life."},"1341":{"dur":5,"text":"In fact, we could say here that you can actually measure how much you truly understand these things"},"1346":{"dur":4,"text":"by how much it gives you a burden, as we see in Paul
