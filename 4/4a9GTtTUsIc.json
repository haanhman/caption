of podcast downloads per episode."},"51":{"dur":1,"text":"All right."},"53":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm just giving that as an example."},"54":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, we need to modify that to make it really\nactionable."},"58":{"dur":6,"text":"So the first is making it hyper, hyper specific\nso we need a timeline at the very least."},"65":{"dur":4,"text":"So let's say within six months doubling, and\nthis is a real example for me, doubling the"},"70":{"dur":1,"text":"number of podcast downloads."},"71":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, downloads are ongoing so by what point\nin time?"},"74":{"dur":5,"text":"All right, I want to double the number of\npodcast downloads per episode by week six"},"80":{"dur":2,"text":"after publication and I want to accomplish\nthat within six months."},"83":{"dur":1,"text":"All right."},"84":{"dur":4,"text":"And then we can borrow from David Allen and\njust ask what are some of the prerequisites,"},"89":{"dur":4,"text":"the component pieces of doing that?"},"93":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's break it out into say content and organic."},"97":{"dur":4,"text":"You could have it paid acquisition, you make\na long list of these potential buckets of"},"101":{"dur":1,"text":"activities."},"102":{"dur":3,"text":"From there you would look at next physical\nactions, and this is directly from getting"},"106":{"dur":1,"text":"things done."},"108":{"dur":3,"text":"And you could apply that to any number of\nthese, let's just say it's ten buckets but"},"112":{"dur":4,"text":"you would ask yourself, this is a question\nI ask myself very often when I'm procrastinating"},"116":{"dur":5,"text":"because there is indecision, and this is a\nparticular breed of procrastination."},"122":{"dur":4,"text":"In other words if I have ten things on my\nto do list or ten potential products I could"},"126":{"dur":3,"text":"pursue what to do in that situation?"},"130":{"dur":5,"text":"And what I ask myself is which one of these\nif done

rest"},"141":{"dur":4,"text":"easier to do if done first, or all the rest\nirrelevant, don't even need to do them."},"145":{"dur":3,"text":"That is how I will hone in on one piece of\nthe puzzle."},"149":{"dur":1,"text":"And this can be applied all over the place."},"151":{"dur":5,"text":"But let's just say it's the doubling podcast,\nit could be losing weight, you can see that's"},"156":{"dur":1,"text":"very, very amorphous."},"157":{"dur":1,"text":"We need timelines."},"158":{"dur":2,"text":"We need an amount to lose."},"161":{"dur":1,"text":"And then you want to make it as small as possible."},"163":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'll give you a different example."},"165":{"dur":2,"text":"If you want to start flossing your teeth,\nwho likes flossing your teeth?"},"167":{"dur":1,"text":"Pretty much nobody."},"169":{"dur":1,"text":"So how do you start flossing your teeth?"},"171":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, you want to make it as easy as possible\nto develop as part of your routine, to make"},"175":{"dur":4,"text":"it as automatic as anything else that you\ndo consistently."},"180":{"dur":4,"text":"And you could borrow from the say BJ Fogg\nwho's done a lot of research at Stanford and"},"184":{"dur":5,"text":"elsewhere, make it as small as possible, meaning\nin the beginning do less than you're capable"},"189":{"dur":1,"text":"of doing."},"190":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is another key when you think something\nis too big or onerous, so it's too intimidating"},"195":{"dur":2,"text":"or it's too much of a pain in the ass."},"198":{"dur":4,"text":"So for flossing you might say I'm only going\nto floss my front two teeth."},"202":{"dur":1,"text":"That's three gaps."},"203":{"dur":1,"text":"That's all you're going to do."},"204":{"dur":3,"text":"And you want to make it, again, as easy as\npossible."},"208":{"dur":5,"text":"So you might use a WaterPik or you might use\nthose disposable flossing gadgets so you don't"},"213":{"dur":7,"text":"have to do tourniquets on your fingers, which\nis also one of the side effects of flossing"},"220":{"dur":1,"text":"that deters people."},"222":{"dur":1,"text":"Make it as easy as possible."},"223":{"dur":2,"text":"Now this applies to a lot more than flossing."},"226":{"dur":6,"text":"So I've talked to many of the people for say\nTools of Titans, people who are eight time"},"232":{"dur":6,"text":"New York Times best-selling authors or prolific\nmusicians, prolific music producers like Rick"},"239":{"dur":5,"text":"Rubin who is legendary, and it all comes down\nto tiny homework assignments."},"244":{"dur":4,"text":"So Rick if he has a stuck artist, for instance,\nhe will say can you get me one word or one"},"249":{"dur":6,"text":"line that you might like for this song that\nyou're working on by tomorrow, is that possible?"},"256":{"dur":2,"text":"Many, many homework assignments."},"258":{"dur":2,"text":"So with the creative project in the beginning\nthat's one."},"260":{"dur":4,"text":"It's related to a piece of advice that I got\nfrom Neil Strauss, eight times New York times"},"265":{"dur":4,"text":"best selling author, he has written for The\nNew York Times, he's written for Rolling Stone"},"269":{"dur":3,"text":"Magazine, and that is lower your standards."},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"So he doesn't believe in writer's block."},"275":{"dur":1,"text":"He says your standards are just too high."},"277":{"dur":2,"text":"You're creating performance anxiety for yourself."},"279":{"dur":6,"text":"So the advice that I got from another writer,\nwhich matches with that, is two crappy pages"},"286":{"dur":1,"text":"per day."},"287":{"dur":1,"text":"So a lot of people are like I'm going to kill\nit."},"289":{"dur":1,"text":"I need an ambitious goal."},"290":{"dur":5,"text":"Let me do 1500 words, 2000 words per day for\nthis book I'm working on."},"295":{"dur":6,"text":"Well, there is a very high probability that\nyou're going to fall short of that and then"},"301":{"dur":3,"text":"you will get demoralized, then you will get\nintimidated by the task and then you'll start"},"305":{"dur":1,"text":"procrastinating."},"306":{"dur":5,"text":"So make the hurdle, make the success threshold\nreally, really low."},"311":{"dur":4,"text":"That's what I've done for my last three books\nis two crappy pages per day."},"316":{"dur":1,"text":"That's all I need."},"317":{"dur":3,"text":"If I don't end up using them that's fine I\njust need to get out two crappy pages."},"320":{"dur":1,"text":"What ends up happening?"},"321":{"dur":5,"text":"With the flossing, with the writing, with\nsay exercise, if you're going to exercise"},"326":{"dur":4,"text":"you're making a New Year's Resolution, don't\nmake it an hour a day four times a week, no,"},"330":{"dur":5,"text":"no, no, and if you don't have an exercise\nhabit five to ten minutes at the gym three"},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"times a week, plenty."},"338":{"dur":6,"text":"And in all those cases you will feel successful\nbecause you've checked your box for success"},"344":{"dur":2,"text":"and then very often you will exceed that for\nextra credit."},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"You'll be like oh I'm already at the gym I'll\ngo for an extra ten minutes."},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, I'm already flossing my teeth I'll do\nan extra four."},"352":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, I've already hit my two pages but I'm\nfeeling great and I'm in the flow, maybe I'll"},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"do ten, maybe I'll do 20."},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"But it prevents you from feeling like a failure."},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"This is very, very important."},"362":{"dur":4,"text":"That is what derails a lot of people and it\nalso makes the task list intimidating."},"366":{"dur":3,"text":"So those are a few recommendations for avoiding\nprocrastination."},"369":{"dur":1,"text":"Some of them are time related."},"371":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you are looking at a task, and we've\nalready talked about chunking it down, if"},"375":{"dur":5,"text":"it looks gigantic an onerous and you calculate\nin your mind well that's probably going to"},"380":{"dur":4,"text":"take me a hundred hours or three weeks, however\nyou look at it, you don't take the first step"},"385":{"dur":5,"text":"because it's like taking a bite out of a whale\nor something like that."},"390":{"dur":3,"text":"So you can use the technique, for instance,\nlike the pomodoro technique."},"393":{"dur":3,"text":"And people have interpreted this in different\nways but it effectively means sprints of say"},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"20 to 25."},"399":{"dur":4,"text":"Some people do 23 minutes where you're like\nall right I know I'm not going to get this"},"404":{"dur":6,"text":"done but I'm going to sprint for 20 minutes,\n25 minutes and then take a five-minute break."},"410":{"dur":4,"text":"And then I will sprint again for 20 to 25\nminutes."},"415":{"dur":3,"text":"And the magic of those time constraints, I've\ntalked about this a lot has Parkinson's Law,"},"418":{"dur":4,"text":"but the complexity of a task swelling to fill\nthe time that it's allotted."},"423":{"dur":4,"text":"Once you have these positive constraints,\nwhich by the way for a creative person, very"},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"important to have positive constraints."},"430":{"dur":4,"text":"Being able to do anything you want all the\ntime is a recipe for disaster and paralysis"},"435":{"dur":1,"text":"and procrastination."},"436":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'll talk about one or more constraint\nthat you can apply."},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"So you have something like the pomodoro technique."},"442":{"dur":3,"text":"If it's email related you can actually use\na tool called Email Game."},"446":{"dur":4,"text":"I won't go into a long description but emailga.me\nis the URL."},"451":{"dur":1,"text":"You can check that out."},"452":{"dur":3,"text":"It avoids the inbox view and forces you to\nanswer sequentially."},"456":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'll let people check that out."},"457":{"dur":4,"text":"That will probably cut down your email clearing\ntime by 40 percent or so."},"461":{"dur":6,"text":"The next way that you can apply positive constraint\nis by building in incentives and consequences."},"468":{"dur":4,"text":"All this means is make yourself socially accountable."},"473":{"dur":7,"text":"And you can use a site like Stickk.com, you\ncan use Coach.tome, having someone else to"},"480":{"dur":5,"text":"hold your feet to the fire and keep you accountable\nfor whatever goal you've set for yourself."},"485":{"dur":4,"text":"That could be a check in via phone, it could\nbe a bet, so a financial component, which"},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"is very effect."},"491":{"dur":5,"text":"I've seen high ranking folks at Google lose\na hundred plus pounds because they had a bet"},"496":{"dur":4,"text":"with a friend, this is what got them started,\ntheir gym buddies if someone didn't show up"},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"they had to pay the other person a dollar."},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's incredible what a small amount of\nmoney can do."},"505":{"dur":5,"text":"You could also put together a betting pool\nsay five people each put in $100 and the person"},"510":{"dur":4,"text":"who loses the most of body fat or improves\ntheir body fat percentage using say DEXA Scan"},"514":{"dur":4,"text":"by the end of the first-quarter gets the $500."},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"That is hugely, hugely effective."},"521":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think in part not because the money\nyou will win but the money you will lose."},"525":{"dur":5,"text":"People will work a lot harder to counteract\nloss eversion it turns out."},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"So those are a few things that you could utilize."},"534":{"dur":4,"text":"And I'll give you one kind of wacky one that\nis from Mike Birbiglia who's one of the most"},"539":{"dur":6,"text":"successful comedians on the planet, has done\ntons of TV, tons of movies and is fantastic"},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"at standup does, lot with This American Life."},"548":{"dur":7,"text":"And when he was procrastinating working on\nhis screenplay, his latest screenplay, we"},"556":{"dur":4,"text":"noticed that when he was accountable to someone\nelse he had a meeting he was never late, he"},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"was always early."},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"But when he had a commitment to himself to\nwrite he might put it off for hours."},"565":{"dur":5,"text":"So he took a Post-it and he put it next to\nhis bed, and this sounds ludicrous, but it"},"570":{"dur":5,"text":"said, Mike, and I think it was three exclamation\npoints, you have a meeting with yourself at"},"576":{"dur":5,"text":"7:00 a.m. at caf\u00e9 whatever it was where he\nintended to work and that actually for whatever"},"582":{"dur":6,"text":"weird quirk of human psychology got him to\nstay on track for his meeting with himself"},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"to write his screenplay."},"590":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's another Jedi mind trick that you\nmight try on yourself."},"593":{"dur":5,"text":"There are many tools in the toolkit but keep\nit small, keep it defined, rig it so you can"},"599":{"dur":7,"text":"win and when in doubt figure out a way to\ncreate a loss or shame if you don't actually"},"606":{"dur":4,"text":"tackle your task and achieve some type of\nmeasurable goal by a specific point in time."}}
