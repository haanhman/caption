us."},"21":{"dur":2,"text":"RICHARD THALER: I'm going\nto change the answers, so--"},"23":{"dur":1,"text":"HAL VARIAN: It's kind\nof like the distinction"},"25":{"dur":2,"text":"between microeconomics\nand macroeconomics,"},"27":{"dur":3,"text":"because in micro, it's different\nquestions but the same answers."},"31":{"dur":2,"text":"In macro, it's the same\nquestion, with different."},"33":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is kind of a\nbehavioral economics"},"35":{"dur":4,"text":"has in common with some\nother parts of economics."},"39":{"dur":5,"text":"But one of the good\nlead-in questions"},"44":{"dur":2,"text":"that we had last night, I'm\ngoing to run again today,"},"47":{"dur":2,"text":"is, what does this\nmean, Misbehaving?"},"49":{"dur":1,"text":"What kind of title is that?"},"50":{"dur":1,"text":"Where did it come from?"},"52":{"dur":6,"text":"RICHARD THALER: So\ntitle kind of reflects"},"59":{"dur":2,"text":"three aspects of the book."},"61":{"dur":5,"text":"The first is that economists\nhave a particular view"},"67":{"dur":8,"text":"of humanity-- if we want to\ncall it humanity, or inhumanity."},"75":{"dur":4,"text":"So if you read a\ngraduate level textbook,"},"79":{"dur":9,"text":"like Hal's-- that'll be\n$1 please, for the plug--"},"89":{"dur":5,"text":"the people he's describing\nin the models are not ones"},"94":{"dur":3,"text":"you'd recognize\nin ordinary life."},"98":{"dur":4,"text":"They're are as good\nat math as Hal."},"102":{"dur":7,"text":"They are as good at\nself control as

wouldn't get caught."},"122":{"dur":3,"text":"So for the last 40\nyears or so, I've"},"125":{"dur":5,"text":"been studying humans-- I call\nthose mythical creatures econs,"},"131":{"dur":2,"text":"and I've been studying humans."},"133":{"dur":5,"text":"And by economists'\nstandards, humans misbehave."},"139":{"dur":5,"text":"And so, that's the first meaning\nof misbehaving in this book,"},"144":{"dur":2,"text":"it's the people I talk about."},"146":{"dur":4,"text":"The second meaning\nis the fact that I've"},"151":{"dur":4,"text":"devoted my career to\nstudying that was itself"},"156":{"dur":3,"text":"an act of misbehaving,\nbecause economists"},"159":{"dur":1,"text":"are supposed to study econs."},"161":{"dur":4,"text":"And what are you doing\nstudying these other people?"},"166":{"dur":5,"text":"And maybe a third\nis, and it's kind of"},"172":{"dur":2,"text":"consistent with the\nsecond, the book"},"174":{"dur":4,"text":"is not written as a proper\nbook, or at least everyone"},"178":{"dur":2,"text":"in the publishing\nindustry told me"},"181":{"dur":2,"text":"one is not supposed to\nwrite a book like this."},"183":{"dur":6,"text":"So it's structured\nkind of as a memoir,"},"190":{"dur":4,"text":"but it's a primer in\nbehavioral economics,"},"195":{"dur":2,"text":"so there's a lot of\nsubstance in there."},"197":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's at least\nmeant to be funny."},"201":{"dur":3,"text":"And I was told that\nthe set of books"},"205":{"dur":4,"text":"that are substantive,\nfunny memoirs,"},"209":{"dur":6,"text":"and have sold as many as\n100 copies, is the null set."},"216":{"dur":3,"text":"And so you probably shouldn't\nwrite a book like that."},"219":{"dur":1,"text":"But that's the book I wrote."},"221":{"dur":3,"text":"It was the only\nbook I could write."},"225":{"dur":3,"text":"HAL VARIAN: You might say, also,\nthat the econs are misbehaving"},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"from the viewpoint\nof the humans."},"231":{"dur":2,"text":"Like for example,\nhumans are expected"},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"to leave tips at restaurants,\nand that kind of thing."},"236":{"dur":1,"text":"RICHARD THALER:\nAh, that's right."},"237":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, econs don't\nleave tips at restaurants"},"241":{"dur":6,"text":"they don't plan to go back\nto, because why would you?"},"247":{"dur":2,"text":"HAL VARIAN: Of course,\nthat's a bit of exaggeration."},"249":{"dur":4,"text":"RICHARD THALER:\nWell, only a bit."},"254":{"dur":6,"text":"I mean, it is true that many\neconomists have taken seriously"},"261":{"dur":3,"text":"some of the departures."},"264":{"dur":6,"text":"My late colleague Gary\nBecker, in some ways,"},"270":{"dur":5,"text":"his career was devoted\nto the opposite of mine."},"276":{"dur":3,"text":"Although we both studied\nodd kinds of behavior,"},"280":{"dur":5,"text":"his approach was\nmodeling everything"},"285":{"dur":3,"text":"through the lens of a\nrational

sorry."},"301":{"dur":1,"text":"RICHARD THALER:\nThat is misbehaving."},"302":{"dur":1,"text":"HAL VARIAN: I\nknow, I'm so sorry."},"304":{"dur":3,"text":"RICHARD THALER:\nThat's a new chapter."},"307":{"dur":3,"text":"Take the books back, I\nhave to add the chapter"},"310":{"dur":3,"text":"on cell phone misbehaving."},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"So yeah, I mean you\ncould write down"},"317":{"dur":7,"text":"a model where you care about\nthe opinion of the waiter,"},"324":{"dur":3,"text":"and so therefore\nyou leave a tip."},"327":{"dur":3,"text":"But that's kind of\na tautological model"},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"that isn't very helpful."},"333":{"dur":2,"text":"HAL VARIAN: And I should say,\nwe warned people last night."},"335":{"dur":3,"text":"The American Economics\nAssociation meeting,"},"339":{"dur":4,"text":"annual meeting, is going to be\nin San Francisco in January."},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"And we expect all waiters\nand waitresses to leave

either they\ndon't realize that the AEA is"},"356":{"dur":4,"text":"in town in January, or they\ndon't know that economists are"},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"bad tippers."},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"But yeah,

not"},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"you leave a generous\ntip is whether you ever"},"389":{"dur":1,"text":"worked as a waiter or waitress."},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"RICHARD THALER: Yeah,\nI think that's true."},"394":{"dur":4,"text":"You know, I saw an interesting\nop-ed about tipping,"},"399":{"dur":2,"text":"that I've kind of\ntaken to heart,"},"401":{"dur":5,"text":"which is that if you're\nconcerned about inequality"},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"of the sort that\nPiketty talks about,"},"408":{"dur":4,"text":"here's one small thing you can\ndo-- become a better tipper."},"412":{"dur":6,"text":"And so I've just decided\nto leave bigger tips."},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not going to\nchange the world,"},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"but all the people\nwho get tips from me"},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"are much poorer than me."},"426":{"dur":3,"text":"And I can spend a\nlittle wealth that way."},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"HAL VARIAN: That's\na very useful

anomalies."},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact, tell me how you\ngot started in the business."},"441":{"dur":1,"text":"RICHARD THALER: Ah\nyeah, well there's"},"443":{"dur":3,"text":"fishing for a compliment."},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"No, deservedly so."},"448":{"dur":7,"text":"So Hal once introduced\nme to someone, and said,"},"456":{"dur":1,"text":"this is Richard Thaler."},"457":{"dur":1,"text":"Actually, I invented him."},"461":{"dur":3,"text":"And so here's what Hal meant."},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"We've known each\nother for longer"},"467":{"dur":3,"text":"than we would care to admit."},"470":{"dur":5,"text":"And, let's see,\nthis was about 1986."},"476":{"dur":3,"text":"We were at a\nconference together."},"480":{"dur":4,"text":"I don't remember where, we\nwere eating a meal together."},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"And Hal was telling\nme about a new journal"},"487":{"dur":3,"text":"the AEA was starting, called\nthe Journal of Economic"},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"Perspectives."},"492":{"dur":4,"text":"And the aim of the\njournal was to have"},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"articles written\nin what economists"},"500":{"dur":3,"text":"would pass for plain English."},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"So not really\narticles for laymen,"},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"but articles for\nnon-specialists."},"509":{"dur":5,"text":"So an article that any economist\nor economics grad student"},"514":{"dur":1,"text":"could read."},"516":{"dur":5,"text":"And so I said, oh,\nthat's interesting."},"522":{"dur":4,"text":"And then he and I\ndreamed up the idea"},"526":{"dur":3,"text":"for a column in that journal\nthat I ended up starting"},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"to write, called Anomalies."},"533":{"dur":3,"text":"And for four years,\nonce a quarter,"},"536":{"dur":3,"text":"I wrote about an anomaly."},"540":{"dur":6,"text":"And I think that--\nso I owe Hal a debt,"},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"and the field of\nbehavioral economics"},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"owes Hal a debt for that."},"552":{"dur":1,"text":"He convinced Joe\nStiglitz, who was"},"554":{"dur":3,"text":"the editor at the\ntime-- who, I think,"},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"didn't need much convincing."},"559":{"dur":1,"text":"HAL VARIAN: No, he\nwas easy to convince."},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"RICHARD THALER: Joe's a\nbit of a troublemaker,"},"562":{"dur":4,"text":"so he liked the fact that I\nwas going to stir the pot."},"567":{"dur":4,"text":"You know, Kuhn, the great\nphilosopher of science,"},"572":{"dur":3,"text":"talks about paradigm shifts."},"575":{"dur":4,"text":"And how do you create\na paradigm shift?"},"579":{"dur":3,"text":"And the only way to\ndo it is to create"},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"a long list of anomalies."},"585":{"dur":4,"text":"Because any one or two\ncan be explained away."},"590":{"dur":3,"text":"OK, so people leave\ntips, even at restaurants"},"593":{"dur":1,"text":"they don't go back to."},"594":{"dur":9,"text":"But, you know, maybe--\nand if the set of excuses"},"603":{"dur":3,"text":"for each anomaly\nhas to be different,"},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"then people start\nto wonder, oh, yeah,"},"610":{"dur":3,"text":"maybe there's a more\nbasic problem here."},"613":{"dur":4,"text":"So the fact that I could\nwrite 14 Anomalies columns"},"618":{"dur":4,"text":"about different things, I think\nchanged some people's mind."},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"And the fact that\nthe 1987 stock market"},"626":{"dur":3,"text":"crash occurred during\nthe very period"},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"when I was writing these\ncolumns may have also helped."},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"You didn't do that,\nI don't think."},"635":{"dur":4,"text":"HAL VARIAN: No, that wasn't\nmy fault. In the book,"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"you said it was partly a\ntutorial about behavior"},"642":{"dur":0,"text":"economics."},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"And you go through\nthis long list--"},"644":{"dur":3,"text":"it's a long list of\naspects of human behavior"},"647":{"dur":3,"text":"that are not accounted for\nby conventional theory."},"651":{"dur":3,"text":"And the first one-- both\ntemporally and in the book--"},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"is in fact the endowment effect."},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"So why don't you tell us\nabout the endowment effect."},"660":{"dur":1,"text":"RICHARD THALER:\nSo let me tell you"},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"when I first discovered\nwhat I later came"},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"to call the endowment effect."},"666":{"dur":6,"text":"My PhD thesis was\non a topic that"},"672":{"dur":6,"text":"sounds funny-- or not funny,\nbut odd-- the value of a life."},"679":{"dur":5,"text":"And this wasn't philosophical,\nthis was an economics problem."},"684":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's a problem that all\ngovernments have to deal with."},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"We can make things safer."},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"We can make highways safer--\nwe could lower the speed limit,"},"694":{"dur":3,"text":"we can do all kinds\nof things to reduce"},"697":{"dur":1,"text":"the chance you're going die."},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"How much should we be\nwilling to spend on that?"},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"We don't want to spend\nall our money on that."},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"So we need a number."},"706":{"dur":3,"text":"And so that was what\nmy thesis was about."},"710":{"dur":3,"text":"And it was a very\nstraight economics,"},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"econometrics\nexercise, estimating"},"716":{"dur":4,"text":"how much you had to pay people\nto get them to take risky jobs."},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"Like in logging, or\ncoal mining, or window"},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"washing on skyscrapers."},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"But while I was\nworking on that, sort"},"729":{"dur":4,"text":"of as a break from\nwriting Fortran code,"},"734":{"dur":1,"text":"I decided I'd ask a question."},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"So I asked the following\nquestion-- suppose,"},"741":{"dur":3,"text":"by attending, this\nlecture today,"},"745":{"dur":5,"text":"you've been exposed to\na rare, fatal disease."},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's a one\nin a thousand chance"},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"you're going to\ndrop dead next week."},"756":{"dur":5,"text":"A quick and painless\ndeath, not to worry."},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"We have one cure."},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"It's in this glass right, here."},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"And we'll sell it to\nthe highest bidder."},"768":{"dur":1,"text":"How much will you pay?"},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"That's question one."},"772":{"dur":5,"text":"Question two is Stanford\nis running some studies"},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"on that same disease,\nand they need"},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"volunteers for an experiment."},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"All you have to do\nis walk into a room"},"784":{"dur":3,"text":"and expose yourself to one\nin a thousand risk of death."},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"There will be no cure available."},"791":{"dur":2,"text":"What would you have to\nbe paid to participate"},"794":{"dur":1,"text":"in that experiment?"},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"Now according to\neconomic theory,"},"798":{"dur":1,"text":"the answers to those\nquestions should"},"800":{"dur":2,"text":"be approximately the same."},"802":{"dur":5,"text":"And the responses I got\nwere wildly different."},"808":{"dur":5,"text":"So someone would say, oh,\nI'd pay $5,000 for that cure,"},"814":{"dur":4,"text":"but I wouldn't do that\nexperiment for $500,000."},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"So orders of\nmagnitude difference."},"821":{"dur":6,"text":"And then, I started\nlowering the stakes."},"828":{"dur":7,"text":"You know, suppose somebody\noffers you two tickets to one"},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"of the Warriors playoffs games."},"838":{"dur":3,"text":"And let's say the market\nprice for those tickets"},"842":{"dur":4,"text":"is $1,000 each."},"847":{"dur":4,"text":"Would you be willing to pay\n$1,000 to get those tickets?"},"851":{"dur":1,"text":"Probably not."},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"Would you sell them for $1,000?"},"855":{"dur":1,"text":"Probably not."},"856":{"dur":4,"text":"OK, well that's the\nendowment effect."},"861":{"dur":7,"text":"And what it implies is a\nkind of status quo bias."},"868":{"dur":3,"text":"That if somebody gives\nus the tickets, we'll go."},"872":{"dur":3,"text":"But if they don't give us\nthe tickets, we won't go."},"875":{"dur":7,"text":"And your econ 101 quiz question,\nif you've got those tickets"},"882":{"dur":2,"text":"and the market prices\nis $1,000, how much does"},"885":{"dur":1,"text":"it cost you to go to the game?"},"887":{"dur":2,"text":"Answer, $1,000."},"890":{"dur":2,"text":"But that's not the way\npeople think about it."},"893":{"dur":6,"text":"And eventually, I started\nhaving a list on my blackboard,"},"899":{"dur":6,"text":"as an assistant professor,\nof weird shit people do."},"905":{"dur":5,"text":"And that was the first\nthing on my list."},"911":{"dur":6,"text":"The second one goes\nback to a dinner party"},"918":{"dur":2,"text":"I hosted as a graduate student."},"921":{"dur":4,"text":"And while some\nroast or something"},"925":{"dur":4,"text":"was cooking in the oven,\ncreating delightful aromas,"},"930":{"dur":3,"text":"I brought out a\nbowl of cashew nuts."},"933":{"dur":4,"text":"And we all started\nmunching away."},"937":{"dur":7,"text":"And the bowl of cashew nuts and\nour appetites were in danger."},"945":{"dur":4,"text":"And so after a few\nminutes, I took the bowl,"},"949":{"dur":3,"text":"and-- eating a few\nmore nuts on the way--"},"952":{"dur":4,"text":"went and hid it in the\nkitchen, and came back."},"957":{"dur":3,"text":"And this was a group\nof econ grad students."},"961":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we immediately\nstarted analyzing"},"965":{"dur":2,"text":"what had just happened."},"967":{"dur":1,"text":"There's a rule of\nthumb I mentioned"},"969":{"dur":3,"text":"in Nudge, my\nprevious book, which"},"973":{"dur":4,"text":"is that the conversation\nat a dinner party"},"978":{"dur":3,"text":"will be ruined if more\nthan half the guests come"},"981":{"dur":1,"text":"from the economics department."},"983":{"dur":2,"text":"And this story is\nan illustration"},"985":{"dur":3,"text":"of that, since the removal\nof a bowl of cashew nuts"},"989":{"dur":2,"text":"led to a decision tree."},"991":{"dur":5,"text":"And what economists\nall know is that one"},"997":{"dur":4,"text":"can't be made better\noff if one's
