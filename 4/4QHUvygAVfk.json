response."},"483":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's the process of learning from injury\nor from pain."},"487":{"dur":6,"text":"You may have noticed the last time you experienced\na lot of pain, it was kind of sticky in your"},"493":{"dur":1,"text":"mind.\nYou kept thinking about it or maybe you wanted"},"495":{"dur":4,"text":"to tell the story to somebody else.\nAnd that's a really common response to pain."},"499":{"dur":3,"text":"The mind -- the brain -- is trying to grapple\nwith what happened so that it can learn from"},"503":{"dur":4,"text":"it and avoid that pain in the future.\nBut it means that we get very stuck on our"},"508":{"dur":4,"text":"painful experiences, and we may become even\nmore vigilant for any evidence of threat or"},"513":{"dur":4,"text":"pain in the body.\nAnd at the level of the nervous system, your"},"517":{"dur":4,"text":"body and your brain are also trying to adapt\nin a way that's going to make it easier to"},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"respond to the same danger or threat in the\nfuture."},"525":{"dur":6,"text":"So, for example, if you've had a back injury,\nthe nerves of the spine and of the back are"},"531":{"dur":5,"text":"going to actually get better at listening\nto signs of pressure or inflammation or damage"},"536":{"dur":4,"text":"to the connective tissue or to the muscles.\nLiterally, those pain receptors are going"},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"to get better at listening for it.\nAnd they're going to be more eager to send"},"543":{"dur":4,"text":"a signal of pain to your brain so that you\nwill be able to respond more quickly."},"548":{"dur":4,"text":"And this way, we have a back now that is sensitized\nto pain."},"552":{"dur":4,"text":"And this learning process happens pretty much\nwith any injury or with any illness where"},"557":{"dur":4,"text":"the body is prepared to experience that pain\nagain."},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"And you can kind of think of this as being\nlike backwards from the immune

again."},"571":{"dur":4,"text":"But with pain, once you've had a certain type\nof pain, you're actually more likely to experience"},"576":{"dur":5,"text":"it again because of the way that the body\nand the brain adapts to a pain experience."},"582":{"dur":4,"text":"And then, this level of learning from our\npain shows up in one last way, which is that,"},"586":{"dur":4,"text":"we may try to avoid things that could re-create\nthis pain."},"590":{"dur":4,"text":"And for people who've had very painful experience\n -- like an accident or an injury or a

self-perpetuating cycle"},"602":{"dur":4,"text":"where, the more we fear pain, the less we're\nwilling to do, and our lives get smaller and"},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"smaller.\nThat was my experience for awhile also."},"609":{"dur":5,"text":"Okay, so this first big idea is that -- thanks\nto evolution -- we have an instinctive and"},"615":{"dur":4,"text":"protective mind\/body response that helps us\ndeal with real threat."},"619":{"dur":5,"text":"And even though it can be annoying, it's useful.\nBut the second key idea to come out of research"},"625":{"dur":5,"text":"in the last decade is that, chronic pain doesn't\nwork like acute pain."},"630":{"dur":4,"text":"It is not useful in the way that an acute\npain process is."},"635":{"dur":5,"text":"Chronic pain is overprotective and learned,\nnot protective and instinctive."},"640":{"dur":5,"text":"People who have chronic pain have a body and\na brain that have learned to be oversensitive"},"645":{"dur":4,"text":"to a particular type of pain or a part of\nthe pain process, because it has learned so"},"650":{"dur":5,"text":"well from whatever the initial injury or illness\nor accident or traumatic event was."},"656":{"dur":4,"text":"And there's a lot of different ways that people\nwith chronic pain may have learned this sort"},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"of over-responsiveness.\nI mentioned one, which is the sensitization"},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"of nerves.\nThat is, once you have an injury and illness,"},"667":{"dur":5,"text":"many times, part of the healing process is\nmaking the nervous system more likely to think"},"673":{"dur":4,"text":"that you are in pain.\nAnd for some people, it goes as far as having"},"677":{"dur":6,"text":"ordinary, safe sensations being strongly interpreted\nby the nervous system and by the brain as"},"684":{"dur":5,"text":"being \"dangerous, unsafe, and painful.\"\nAnd a classic example of that is someone who"},"689":{"dur":6,"text":"has back pain or maybe an old shoulder injury\nor knee injury where they start to exercise"},"695":{"dur":3,"text":"again.\nAnd the body interprets the very normal, safe"},"699":{"dur":5,"text":"-- even healing -- movements of a gentle\nexercise practice as being painful and damaging."},"704":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's a real experience.\nThe pain is not somehow in your mind."},"709":{"dur":5,"text":"It's real -- and it is physiological, but\nit's no longer realistic."},"714":{"dur":3,"text":"It has nothing to do with actual harm that's\nbeing created in your body."},"718":{"dur":4,"text":"And this is a really key insight if you have\nchronic pain that it's almost as if the body"},"723":{"dur":6,"text":"and the brain are lying to you about what\nis safe and the state of your body and the"},"729":{"dur":7,"text":"state of your health.\nAnd when the body has learned to be oversensitive"},"736":{"dur":3,"text":"in this way -- sort of over-learned from the\nexperience of pain -- it's really important"},"739":{"dur":3,"text":"to unlearn this process, and that's where\nyoga and meditation comes in."},"743":{"dur":6,"text":"It's a process of re-education.\nThe last key idea that's come from the pain"},"749":{"dur":6,"text":"research, which is the one that people tend\nto resist the most, because it sounds -- well,"},"756":{"dur":5,"text":"it sounds both kind of discouraging and also\nalmost -- people have heard for so long that"},"762":{"dur":4,"text":"\"your pain is all in your mind\" or \"your pain\nis just psychological,\" that we can be a little"},"767":{"dur":6,"text":"resistant to hearing that, \"When you have\nchronic pain, emotional pain is not distinct"},"773":{"dur":4,"text":"from physical pain.\"\nThis is not true for all types

grief,\nanger, and something going wrong in the body"},"788":{"dur":3,"text":"that we need to be concerned with.\nOne of my favorite examples comes from research"},"792":{"dur":4,"text":"showing that, people who have chronic back\npain -- when they get angry -- their back"},"797":{"dur":4,"text":"muscles tense up, and there's inflammation\nin the tissues of the back."},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"And that only happens for people who have\nchronic back pain."},"804":{"dur":6,"text":"It's like the nervous system has associated\nso many times anger and stress with that

that reaction in the body."},"821":{"dur":6,"text":"Kind of in the same way that if you were to\nremember a -- don't do this now -- but if"},"827":{"dur":3,"text":"you were to remember a great sexual moment\nin your life, you could trigger some very"},"830":{"dur":7,"text":"real changes in your body, yes? It is possible.\nIt turns out that chronic pain works a lot"},"837":{"dur":2,"text":"like that too.\nAnd there's been some interesting research"},"840":{"dur":5,"text":"at Stanford showing that, even just the memory\nof pain can re-create changes in the body"},"845":{"dur":6,"text":"that are consistent with that pain -- like\nmuscle tension, like inflammation, like an"},"851":{"dur":5,"text":"increased stress response.\nAnd, in addition, one of the things I didn't"},"857":{"dur":4,"text":"mention is that, the protective pain response\nthat I described -- the one that is useful"},"861":{"dur":5,"text":"for us in most situations -- it's the same\nfor a physical threat as for a social threat."},"866":{"dur":6,"text":"That is, the same areas of the brain are recruited,\nincluding physical sensations of pain."},"873":{"dur":4,"text":"If you have been punched in the jaw or if\nyou've been rejected by a loved one, when"},"877":{"dur":4,"text":"you're feeling lonely, you've got pretty much\nthe same process going on -- same regions"},"882":{"dur":4,"text":"of the brain activated -- as when you have\nthe flu."},"886":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's one of the reasons why heartbreak\nreally, really hurts."},"891":{"dur":4,"text":"We're being rejected or when you're feeling\nangry at someone -- it actually hurts."},"895":{"dur":4,"text":"And you can imagine, from an evolutionary\nperspective, why that might be useful too."},"899":{"dur":4,"text":"Because when we think about what threatens\nour well-being, being separated from the tribe"},"904":{"dur":3,"text":"is one of the most dangerous, dangerous things\nthat could happen for your well-being and"},"908":{"dur":2,"text":"for your life.\nAnd so, it seems like evolution has kind of"},"910":{"dur":3,"text":"mapped these two together.\nSo that when you are in emotional pain or"},"914":{"dur":4,"text":"particularly social pain, you're going to\nuse the same systems that help protect you"},"919":{"dur":3,"text":"when there's a physical threat.\nAgain, this gets very tricky with chronic"},"922":{"dur":6,"text":"pain, because it means that the emotions related\nto social relationships -- stress at work,"},"928":{"dur":6,"text":"all of that -- it can reinforce the pain.\nAnd, in fact, for people who have chronic"},"935":{"dur":4,"text":"pain, there's evidence that psychological\nstress even further sensitizes the nervous"},"940":{"dur":2,"text":"system to send those threat signals up to\nthe brain."},"942":{"dur":3,"text":"So, when you're stressed or when you're angry\nor when you're lonely, it's like the whole"},"946":{"dur":4,"text":"nervous system is listening for more evidence\nthat something is wrong."},"951":{"dur":5,"text":"And what all of this means is that, if you\nhave chronic pain, stress management is number"},"956":{"dur":4,"text":"one on the agenda for healing pain.\nAnd even though it sounds kind of \"woo woo\""},"961":{"dur":6,"text":"or fuzzy, handling stress and emotions tends\nto be a lot more effective for chronic pain"},"968":{"dur":5,"text":"than trying to find one thing in the body\nthat's wrong and fixing it with surgery or"},"973":{"dur":4,"text":"medications.\nBecause with chronic pain, that one thing"},"977":{"dur":3,"text":"that's wrong in the body,\nthat was resolved or healed probably a long"},"981":{"dur":4,"text":"time ago, and what you're left with is this\nkind of residual learning that is systemic."},"986":{"dur":5,"text":"It's in the whole body, including the embodied\nmind -- the nervous system, the brain."},"991":{"dur":5,"text":"It's no longer just in your back muscle or\njust in your knee or just in your jaw or wherever"},"997":{"dur":7,"text":"the

it's really exciting how much\nresearch is being done on yoga these days."},"1015":{"dur":3,"text":"I want to share with you some of the findings\nthat might either give you a little more

can drag\npeople to yoga, which is useful."},"1036":{"dur":3,"text":"So there have been a number of studies in\nthe last couple of years showing that yoga"},"1040":{"dur":7,"text":"is more effective for chronic back pain than\nregular exercise or standard medical care."},"1047":{"dur":4,"text":"And that a very gentle yoga practice done\na couple times a week for about 30 minutes"},"1052":{"dur":5,"text":"a day -- some very gentle moving, breathing,\nand relaxation -- actually helps people reduce"},"1057":{"dur":5,"text":"their need for pain medications,

yoga."},"1084":{"dur":3,"text":"Restorative yoga -- you basically lie around\nin a bunch of different positions, hugging"},"1088":{"dur":4,"text":"pillows and breathing.\nAnd this study showed that people who practiced"},"1093":{"dur":4,"text":"restorative yoga have lower baseline levels\nof inflammation."},"1097":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is really key, because inflammation\n -- circulating levels of inflammation in"},"1101":{"dur":4,"text":"your body -- prime you to experience pain.\nThey sensitize the nerves so you're more likely"},"1105":{"dur":4,"text":"to experience pain and discomfort and swelling\nand all of that."},"1110":{"dur":4,"text":"And not only do they have lower baseline levels\nof inflammation, but when the researchers"},"1115":{"dur":5,"text":"expose them to

out, that stress\nresponse doesn't look so unhealthy."},"1127":{"dur":4,"text":"It certainly doesn't look like the kind of\nstress response that really reinforces and"},"1131":{"dur":5,"text":"makes pain worse.\nAnother key study that came out recently was"},"1137":{"dur":5,"text":"looking at people who have an autoimmune disorder,\nwhich tends to be characterized by high levels"},"1142":{"dur":3,"text":"of stress response in the body -- sympathetic\nnervous system activation."},"1146":{"dur":5,"text":"And they found that a short yoga program actually\nreduced baseline
