but"},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"it's to, to Don's credit."},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"And we kind of kept that going."},"600":{"dur":6,"text":"So we continue to hire people mostly from\nmodest

firm."},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"And that is very clear in our minds."},"785":{"dur":5,"text":"Second, we have a different view towards\nrisk, than most other people."},"790":{"dur":3,"text":"People hate to do things because they view\nthem as risky."},"795":{"dur":5,"text":"We actually think that if you're a crystal\nclear thinker, doing nothing is risky."},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're always changing and implementing."},"804":{"dur":1,"text":"And the old adage that if it ain't broke,"},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"don't fix it does not apply to Sequoia\nCapital."},"808":{"dur":1,"text":"It is the exact opposite."},"810":{"dur":3,"text":"If something is working like a dream,\nbreak it,"},"813":{"dur":3,"text":"because you know there are some\ncompetitors out there who are looking
