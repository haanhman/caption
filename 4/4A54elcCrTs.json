Well we are in Bay of Plenty in New Zealand,"},"68":{"dur":3,"text":"at Turanga. And I am with a lovely lady:"},"71":{"dur":6,"text":"Doreen McNeill. Welcome to the show. [Doreen] Pleased to meet you Graeme. [Graeme] It's wonderful to be here. Now"},"77":{"dur":4,"text":"Doreen has a fascinating history. Obviously"},"81":{"dur":4,"text":"you've been painting for a long, long time. [Doreen] A long time. [Graeme] But this is a lady"},"85":{"dur":4,"text":"that came through the second World War, and then ended up coming from,"},"89":{"dur":4,"text":"you always had a great love of art, even as a child. [Doreen] Oh yeah, I loved painting."},"93":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] Yeah. [Doreen] Painting and drawing and color. [Graeme] And the thing was in England"},"97":{"dur":4,"text":"in those days, obviously after the war, there really wasn't many places you could go"},"101":{"dur":4,"text":"to where you could learn art. [Doreen] No, nowhere at all that I could find."},"105":{"dur":4,"text":"All I found was someone teaching me to draw from little"},"109":{"dur":4,"text":"paster casts [Graeme] Yeah. [Doreen] in pencil, on small pieces of paper."},"113":{"dur":4,"text":"And really just telling me to draw - and that was it. And I wanted"},"117":{"dur":4,"text":"color in my life. [Graeme] Yeah, funnily enough. But you went on"},"121":{"dur":4,"text":"to do cartography and ariel drawings for"},"125":{"dur":4,"text":"for aircraft. [Doreen] Yeah, it was closest I could get to anything"},"129":{"dur":4,"text":"sort of art work was as a draftsman."},"133":{"dur":4,"text":"And I ended up with a navigation company which had"},"137":{"dur":4,"text":"this new system for guiding aircraft. [Graeme] Yeah. [Doreen] And"},"141":{"dur":4,"text":"I really enjoyed it. It was so exciting, it was a new"},"145":{"dur":4,"text":"form of navigation. But the work was tight and"},"149":{"dur":4,"text":"tedious. [Graeme] Yeah. [Doreen] No not tedious, but tight and meticulous."},"153":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] Yeah. [Doreen] And I really wanted to let loose and paint, which"},"157":{"dur":4,"text":"I couldn't do there. [Graeme] Yeah. You moved to the Bahamas in the fifties was it?"},"161":{"dur":4,"text":"[Doreen] Yeah. [Graeme] Fifties, [Doreen] Late fifties. [Graeme] and then found a lady there that obviously started"},"165":{"dur":4,"text":"to teach you  [Doreen] Yes. [Graeme] what you wanted to know.  But obviously coming from that really tight"},"169":{"dur":4,"text":"experience with the maps,"},"173":{"dur":4,"text":"Doreen is one of the Grand Dames of abstract art in New Zealand"},"177":{"dur":4,"text":"these days. [Doreen] About that. [Graeme] So it's a really privilege to be here, but"},"181":{"dur":4,"text":"that's what we're going to do today. We're going to do some of your abstract works."},"185":{"dur":4,"text":"One or two - we'll see how we go through the day. And"},"189":{"dur":4,"text":"then just make a great start. But this is, your works really from"},"193":{"dur":4,"text":"the heart, in many senses. [Doreen] Yeah, I just put down some color and see what"},"197":{"dur":3,"text":"happens. Once you've got one color down and things start to happen, and [Graeme] Yeah."},"200":{"dur":4,"text":"[Doreen]  if I need another color and move it around and just play. I love"},"205":{"dur":4,"text":"playing with paint. It's childish I suppose, but I love it."},"209":{"dur":4,"text":"you just see what happens. [Graeme] Absolutely. Well lets make a start"},"213":{"dur":4,"text":"and we'll see where it goes, because it's going to be very interesting. I mean one of the great abstract"},"217":{"dur":4,"text":"artists of New Zealand. It's going to be a great day. Lets go."},"237":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] Okay well you"},"241":{"dur":4,"text":"use really fluid acrylics? [Doreen] Yes, I like the runny acrylic"},"245":{"dur":4,"text":"much better. I like to let the colors run into each other, rather than"},"249":{"dur":4,"text":"not all of the time, but most of the time. [Graeme] Yeah. [Doreen] And"},"253":{"dur":4,"text":"I also use for white, I use quite a lot"},"257":{"dur":4,"text":"of gesso, [Graeme] Okay. [Doreen] rather than white, [Graeme] Oh is that right? Okay. [Doreen] because it's more"},"261":{"dur":4,"text":"opaque. [Graeme] Yes. And I've noticed that the colors"},"265":{"dur":4,"text":"you've got there actually got there are from the local manufacture. [Doreen] Yep, they're Purity colors"},"269":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] Purity. [Doreen] Made locally and they're very reasonably priced. [Graeme] Yeah."},"273":{"dur":4,"text":"[Doreen] I also use Atelier [Graeme] Yeah. [Doreen] tube colors, and they"},"277":{"dur":4,"text":"mix in perfectly well with these as well. [Graeme] Okay."},"281":{"dur":4,"text":"[Doreen] A bit of orange I think, and put on a bit of"},"285":{"dur":4,"text":"Phthalo Blue and I always like to add a little bit of Yellow Ocher. [Graeme] Yep."},"289":{"dur":4,"text":"Oh okay. [Doreen] Just to give it a slightly greenish tinge. Just see"},"293":{"dur":4,"text":"what happens. Pour on a bit of water."},"297":{"dur":4,"text":"I use a lot of spray - just water"},"301":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] Yeah. [Doreen] mostly. And flick a bit"},"305":{"dur":4,"text":"so you don't get too even a coat everywhere."},"309":{"dur":4,"text":"That gives you some lovely textures."},"313":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] And when you put the paint down, you're just moving"},"317":{"dur":4,"text":"the paint. [Doreen] Yep. [Graeme] It's telling a story to you and then you just work with it."},"321":{"dur":4,"text":"[Doreen] Just see with what color wants to go with what. [Graeme] Yep."},"325":{"dur":4,"text":"[Doreen] That was a bit yellow, so a little bit warmer there."},"329":{"dur":4,"text":"because that orange and Phthalo Blue go beautifully"},"333":{"dur":4,"text":"together. [Graeme] Plenty of water."},"337":{"dur":4,"text":"[Doreen] Plenty of water. And I don't, in my painting"},"341":{"dur":4,"text":"I don't really like brush stokes too much. So I tend to get it wet"},"345":{"dur":4,"text":"and then move it around with a knife. [Graeme] Push"},"349":{"dur":4,"text":"it around. [Doreen] Oh it feels lovely to be painting. I've been"},"353":{"dur":4,"text":"not been painting for a few days and it just, lovely just"},"357":{"dur":4,"text":"just messing around with the paint. [Graeme] There you go. Well you've been doing it for quite a"},"361":{"dur":4,"text":"while. Or you've been painting for nearly fifty years or"},"365":{"dur":4,"text":"is fifty years. [Doreen] That's true. It's probably the last"},"369":{"dur":4,"text":"only the last ten to fifteen years, that I've"},"373":{"dur":4,"text":"really felt I can do what I want with it."},"377":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] Yeah. [Doreen] I mean, learning to paint abstractly"},"381":{"dur":4,"text":"or just learning to paint in any way at all, [Graeme] Yeah."},"385":{"dur":4,"text":"[Doreen] is a long, difficult process, and it took me a long while before"},"389":{"dur":4,"text":"I could feel happy with what I was doing. So I enjoyed the"},"393":{"dur":4,"text":"the results and at the moment it's just playing until something"},"397":{"dur":4,"text":"starts to look good. [Graeme] And then it just sort of talks to you. [Doreen] Yeah it does."},"401":{"dur":4,"text":"A little bit of bright yellow now I think. [Graeme] Purity yellow."},"405":{"dur":4,"text":"[Doreen] That's a lighter color and livening it up a bit"},"409":{"dur":4,"text":"more. [Graeme] Who has actually influenced you in your abstract"},"413":{"dur":4,"text":"style? Is there any specific artist at all? I know Turner"},"417":{"dur":4,"text":"was one of them. But what about contemporaries? [Doreen] There's an American"},"421":{"dur":4,"text":"Chinese lady, Katherine Chang Liu. And [Graeme] Yeah. [Doreen] and I just"},"425":{"dur":4,"text":"love her work. She does a lot of drawing in it. It's probably not like what I do at the moment"},"429":{"dur":4,"text":"at all. In fact she doesn't use a lot of color. I don't know"},"433":{"dur":4,"text":"why so much, why I'm really drawn to her work. But I always have since I first"},"437":{"dur":4,"text":"saw it. And when ever I see a group of paintings"},"441":{"dur":4,"text":"like on the web, you're looking at some art, some"},"445":{"dur":4,"text":"abstract work, and occasionally I see hers and before I realise"},"449":{"dur":4,"text":"it's hers - oh I like that one. And the other one is Richard"},"453":{"dur":4,"text":"Diebenkorn,  [Graeme] Okay. [Doreen] American abstract artist.  And"},"457":{"dur":4,"text":"I also see again, oh I like that."},"461":{"dur":4,"text":"It's by him. It's incredible how the well known Masters"},"465":{"dur":4,"text":"really stand out. [Graeme] So what influences and motivates you with"},"469":{"dur":4,"text":"your work? I mean you did suggest nature at one stage, but I think it goes"},"473":{"dur":4,"text":"beyond that for you? [Doreen] There's often an element"},"477":{"dur":4,"text":"of nature, and I particularly like"},"481":{"dur":4,"text":"ariel views, rather than, you know, and it's"},"485":{"dur":4,"text":"probably because I was once drawing charts for aircraft."},"489":{"dur":4,"text":"I think you mentioned earlier. [Graeme] Yes. [Doreen] I don't know why, I didn't fly that much with"},"493":{"dur":4,"text":"the job. But I've always enjoyed looking down when ever I'm in"},"497":{"dur":4,"text":"an airplane. Particularly in the Bahamas when we're there."},"501":{"dur":4,"text":"The water from above is just absolutely fantastic."},"505":{"dur":4,"text":"The turquoise blues and greens and oh,"},"509":{"dur":4,"text":"it's just incredible. [Graeme] You've got, we screen up some of the pictures and"},"513":{"dur":4,"text":"Journey is one that comes to mind. Looks like you're looking down"},"517":{"dur":4,"text":"over the landscape once again. [Doreen] Yeah. [Graeme] Those browns and caramels. [Doreen] A few"},"521":{"dur":4,"text":"that I've done lately, I've been almost like looking up at the stars. It's simple"},"525":{"dur":4,"text":"sort of feeling. You either look down, looking horizontal is not"},"529":{"dur":4,"text":"is nothing like as interesting as up or down. [Graeme] Yeah. Well there"},"533":{"dur":4,"text":"you go. I've just noticed you look up to the ceiling, and you've actually got a mirror on"},"537":{"dur":4,"text":"the ceiling. [Doreen] Yeah. Because I work flat, you can't see it from a distance."},"541":{"dur":4,"text":"And as most artists will tell you, you need to keep stepping back. [Graeme] Yeah."},"545":{"dur":4,"text":"[Doreen] Which doesn't help here but if I can look up into the ceiling, [Graeme] There you go."},"549":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] And you've got a mirror up there. [Doreen] I can check it. [Graeme] That's fascinating. [Doreen] I like"},"553":{"dur":4,"text":"to put in a little bit of crayons now. Do you think you could pass me that box of crayons? [Graeme] Sure, I've got some crayons over"},"557":{"dur":4,"text":"here for you. There you go. [Doreen] Lovely, thanks. [Graeme] There we go."},"561":{"dur":4,"text":"[Doreen] These are Karandash - well used as you can see, [Graeme] Yeah."},"565":{"dur":4,"text":"[Doreen] water soluble crayons [Graeme] Oh okay. [Doreen] and they mix beautifully"},"569":{"dur":4,"text":"with acrylic."},"573":{"dur":4,"text":"You get different textures. I don't often leave them like that. I usually then"},"577":{"dur":4,"text":"paint into them. [Graeme] Just"},"581":{"dur":4,"text":"experimenting with the different textures. [Doreen] I just play around until I find something I like."},"585":{"dur":4,"text":"And I did. It sounds"},"589":{"dur":4,"text":"silly, bit I paint because I enjoy doing it and"},"593":{"dur":4,"text":"so it's fun to me. [Graeme] Yeah. [Doreen] Oh isn't that lovely"},"597":{"dur":4,"text":"Orange? I'm just being completely free."},"601":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] But you were saying before about living in England and then moving to the Bahamas, there was"},"605":{"dur":4,"text":"such a sense of freedom. [Doreen] That's true. Or when I was there it was quite a tight"},"609":{"dur":4,"text":"society, and you always felt restricted as you"},"613":{"dur":4,"text":"had to explain what you were doing, why you were doing it."},"617":{"dur":4,"text":"I felt, it's probably not true, but I never felt completely"},"621":{"dur":4,"text":"free. So I went to the Bahamas -"},"625":{"dur":4,"text":"a completely different way of life. You do what you want, when you want."},"629":{"dur":4,"text":"Obviously there are social restrictions but"},"633":{"dur":4,"text":"for the most part, the heat and the warmth and the fact"},"637":{"dur":4,"text":"that you're wearing less cloths alone, makes you feel freer and happier."},"641":{"dur":4,"text":"And more able to splash paint around instead of drawing"},"645":{"dur":4,"text":"tight little aircraft charts. I'm not"},"649":{"dur":4,"text":"denigrating that because I loved doing that work; it was exciting when I was doing it."},"653":{"dur":4,"text":"But I love this much more, and I really feel its me."},"657":{"dur":4,"text":"That my upbringing was very restricted"},"661":{"dur":4,"text":"just because I was in England, and I found"},"665":{"dur":4,"text":"English life restricting. Silly I know because I probably"},"669":{"dur":4,"text":"didn't live a very restricted life, but I live a much"},"673":{"dur":4,"text":"less one now. I've now got some spots here where I spay, which"},"677":{"dur":4,"text":"don't look right, so I'll just smooth those out a bit. Getting"},"681":{"dur":4,"text":"a bit of a muddy color here, but when you've got bright colors, you need some soft"},"685":{"dur":4,"text":"areas where the color is a bit, not so bright and"},"689":{"dur":4,"text":"demanding. You need a few areas"},"693":{"dur":4,"text":"of softer, greyer color to make the bright colors"},"697":{"dur":4,"text":"stand out. And I've got a little bit muddy"},"701":{"dur":4,"text":"now, so I think I will actually scrape that"},"705":{"dur":4,"text":"that right back. [Graeme] So that brush is as stiff as a board."},"709":{"dur":4,"text":"[Doreen] This is a rubber brush [Graeme] It's rubber is it. Okay.[Doreen] or acrylic, or whatever you call it."},"713":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] Yeah. [Doreen] It's like a [Graeme] That's what it's really meant for."},"717":{"dur":4,"text":"[Doreen] Yep, I think so anyway; I just thought it looked interesting. And it doesn't"},"721":{"dur":4,"text":"work for putting paint on, but it's very good for taking it off."},"725":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] Okay, there you go."},"729":{"dur":4,"text":"[Doreen] I'll come"},"733":{"dur":4,"text":"back to that nice turquoise color that I had before, which had got"},"737":{"dur":4,"text":"lost. [Graeme] With your work, how do you"},"741":{"dur":4,"text":"judge when you feel it's finished? [Doreen] Oh gut instinct, that's"},"745":{"dur":4,"text":"all. [Graeme] And I leave them hanging up in the living room."},"749":{"dur":4,"text":"Usually when I've got to the stage were I think they're nearly finished, and"},"753":{"dur":4,"text":"I just keep looking at them, and if I feel"},"757":{"dur":4,"text":"that's not quite right, or if nothing bothers me"},"761":{"dur":4,"text":"then I reckon it's finished. What I very often do, I get some"},"765":{"dur":4,"text":"varied colors in quite wet. I put some"},"769":{"dur":4,"text":"cellophane on. [Graeme] Oh yeah. [Doreen] And"},"773":{"dur":4,"text":"what I find - this is cellophane."},"777":{"dur":4,"text":"What I do find best is the,"},"781":{"dur":4,"text":"when you get books in the post [Graeme] Yes. [Doreen] they're covered in"},"785":{"dur":4,"text":"this. [Graeme] Yes. [Doreen] And It's lovely because it's not as flexible as"},"789":{"dur":4,"text":"Cling-Wrap  [Graeme] Yeah. [Doreen] and it's not as stiff as cellophane, so"},"793":{"dur":4,"text":"you can move it around. See the texture's coming up now."},"797":{"dur":4,"text":"You can't be sure what's going to happen when it's"},"801":{"dur":4,"text":"dry, and you have to leave it to dry. So I'll just move around and do"},"805":{"dur":4,"text":"a little bit of painting up here while that drys. [Graeme] And then you"},"809":{"dur":4,"text":"just sort of pull it up and all those textures stay on [Doreen] Yep. [Graeme] the canvas itself. That's amazing."},"813":{"dur":4,"text":"[Doreen] And then maybe an orange crayon. [Graeme] These are water soluble"},"817":{"dur":4,"text":"these crayons? [Doreen] Yep. [Graeme] You've got some other really"},"821":{"dur":4,"text":"striking pieces that I've seen in your studio."},"825":{"dur":4,"text":"Reverie, as well  I think is a fantastic piece."},"829":{"dur":4,"text":"And then Lava, which I greatly"},"833":{"dur":4,"text":"like. I think that's fantastic. And then, Out of the Blue."},"837":{"dur":4,"text":"You've got a piece which has all the blues coming through, it's"},"841":{"dur":4,"text":"a fantastic piece as well. And then Flare Up, which is like"},"845":{"dur":4,"text":"two Amebas joining together [Doreen] Yeah. [Graeme] with reds and blacks"},"849":{"dur":4,"text":"all through it. That's pretty dramatic as well. [Doreen] A lot of people said it looks like the top of a volcano. [Graeme] Yeah."},"853":{"dur":4,"text":"[Doreen] I think it was a bit in my mind - I don't know."},"857":{"dur":4,"text":"There really is sort of something flaring up out of it. It's"},"861":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] Definitely, yeah. [Doreen] yeah, I enjoyed that one. That's one of my most recent actually."},"865":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] Yeah, you do a lot of small acrylic sketches that are very affordable as well."},"869":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean, [Doreen] Yes, I love playing with those. [Graeme] yeah, and they're on paper as well."},"873":{"dur":4,"text":"[Doreen] On paper but with gesso on it, [Graeme] Yeah. [Doreen] because with gesso"},"877":{"dur":4,"text":"paper itself, the paint starts soaking in like with watercolor,"},"881":{"dur":4,"text":"and you get a very different feel to painting it on"},"885":{"dur":4,"text":"gesso, so I always put the gesso onto the paper. [Graeme] Yep. [Doreen] And it gives you"},"889":{"dur":4,"text":"a lovely firm surface to work on as well. [Doreen] Okay Doreen, well we've let that dry"},"893":{"dur":4,"text":"for a while now. So what do we do from here? [Doreen] Well, I take this off,"},"897":{"dur":4,"text":"there's a bit of a pattern there which is not great,"},"901":{"dur":4,"text":"but it's different to brush strokes [Graeme] Yeah. [Doreen] which is"},"905":{"dur":4,"text":"what I like. I do feel now I need a bit of color in this"},"909":{"dur":4,"text":"area, to balance over here. This is a bit white and wishy -"},"913":{"dur":4,"text":"wishy washy. I've got a"},"917":{"dur":4,"text":"folder of colored bits of paper which I often"},"921":{"dur":4,"text":"when I've got to a point were I need a new color and I'm not sure what"},"925":{"dur":4,"text":"I get bits of paper out like this and lay them on, see maybe"},"929":{"dur":4,"text":"what would look good. [Graeme] So do you use the paper"},"933":{"dur":4,"text":"on there, or just use it as a guide? [Doreen] Oh no, no this is just to see what would look"},"937":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] Okay. [Doreen] what might look good. [Graeme] Okay. You've just collected this paper over the years"},"941":{"dur":4,"text":"have you? [Doreen] Yeah. Bits when I use to paint on paper a lot"},"945":{"dur":4,"text":"you know, a lot of the bits of the painting looked good so I"},"949":{"dur":4,"text":"keep them. It's sort of a compositional tool too. [Graeme] Yeah. [Doreen] You know,"},"953":{"dur":4,"text":"do I need any straight lines or should I keep this lucid and organic?"},"957":{"dur":4,"text":"I think it dosen't want straight."},"961":{"dur":4,"text":"But I do think a bit of, just a warm color up there would"},"965":{"dur":4,"text":"help. So in fact the easiest thing about"},"969":{"dur":4,"text":"this board is you just turn it around. And I'll put a bit of"},"973":{"dur":4,"text":"warmer color in there. [Graeme] Okay. [Doreen] So a light glaze"},"977":{"dur":4,"text":"over this texture from the transparency"},"981":{"dur":4,"text":"makes quite interesting patterns. And this is where"},"985":{"dur":4,"text":"I could use those crayons again. [Graeme] And do you mostly use the crayons"},"989":{"dur":4,"text":"on the side or do you use the point of the crayon as well? [Doreen] Nearly always on the side."},"993":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] Okay. [Doreen] When I've got near the end I might want some lines,"},"997":{"dur":4,"text":"in which case I'll draw in some lines in. These are all effects"},"1001":{"dur":4,"text":"which you'd never get if you tried to plan them. [Graeme] Yeah. [Doreen] They just happen because"},"1005":{"dur":4,"text":"I've let the paint do what it wants. But yeah, this is coming"},"1009":{"dur":4,"text":"is quite different to anyone I've done before so."},"1013":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] You've been influenced by the Colour In Your Life team. [Doreen] I've always had color in my life."},"1017":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] There you go. [Doreen] Couldn't live without it. So great to see it"},"1021":{"dur":4,"text":"sort of come to live on TV. [Graeme] Yeah. [Doreen] That's marvellous."},"1025":{"dur":4,"text":"Well I need to stop on this now because I'm, where it"},"1029":{"dur":4,"text":"it's all wet, I'm just going to get mud if I don't stop."},"1033":{"dur":4,"text":"I need to let it dry and then have a think about it before I"},"1037":{"dur":4,"text":"really make a decision as to how I want it to finish up."},"1041":{"dur":4,"text":"So I'll just put this aside and I've got another one that I've"},"1045":{"dur":4,"text":"worked on. [Graeme] Okay. [Doreen] I've got this one which I've worked on for some time."},"1049":{"dur":4,"text":"I've decided what it needs now and"},"1053":{"dur":4,"text":"I've done that by putting these bits"},"1057":{"dur":4,"text":"of paper that I've showed you before. [Graeme] Yeah. [Doreen] I've got colored paper. I've got"},"1061":{"dur":4,"text":"a little bit in there which I thought needed a bit of light. I also"},"1065":{"dur":4,"text":"feel that that area needs to be a lot lighter than it is. So"},"1069":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm going to try white with some"},"1073":{"dur":4,"text":"with some more paper over it [Graeme] Okay. [Doreen] so I get a mottled effect."},"1077":{"dur":4,"text":"Because it's well and truly dry I'll get a better"},"1081":{"dur":4,"text":"look than I did before. And for this I don't want a really solid white"},"1085":{"dur":4,"text":"so I use white paint rather than gesso. [Graeme] Okay."},"1089":{"dur":4,"text":"[Doreen] And when I want it to blend in I just wet them with"},"1093":{"dur":4,"text":"water, so it blends in without a line. And now I'm going to put"},"1097":{"dur":4,"text":"the plastic over it and because thats got a nice coat of paint under"},"1101":{"dur":4,"text":"neath, it'll look much better than the previous one, which came out  with the white"},"1105":{"dur":4,"text":"gesso showing through. That's right, now we leave that to dry"},"1109":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] Yeah. [Doreen] and I've got, I've decided I want to do a bit more"},"1113":{"dur":4,"text":"of the darker red down here. [Graeme] Yeah. [Doreen] So for that I'm just"},"1117":{"dur":4,"text":"going to put in a brief line roughly where it"},"1121":{"dur":4,"text":"was, and add some of the darker red.
