...institutional review boards, which\nhave to approve and review every single study."},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a very cumbersome process."},"584":{"dur":7,"text":"So this really slows down the

I think...I'm not claiming that these are\nnot valuable studies or areas of inquiry,"},"618":{"dur":4,"text":"and obviously, we have to start somewhere,\nso here's where we start."},"622":{"dur":7,"text":"But when you boil it all down, when you come\nright down to it, all this literature really"},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"consists of is a set of correlations."},"633":{"dur":7,"text":"A set of correlations between fairly simple\nobservations of a very sophisticated organ"},"640":{"dur":1,"text":"to be sure."},"642":{"dur":6,"text":"Looking at function and structure of brains\nand comparing brains of children to one another"},"648":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's a lot."},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"But at the end of the day, it's just a picture."},"652":{"dur":6,"text":"And correlating that with life histories,\nwhich are quite complex and not very standardized."},"659":{"dur":6,"text":"And the way that these life histories are\nsummarized varies across studies, of course."},"665":{"dur":6,"text":"And then an attempt to look at behavioral\nand functional deficits in the very same children."},"671":{"dur":7,"text":"So that in itself poses difficulties, since\nit does rely on getting good data and having"},"679":{"dur":4,"text":"children who cooperate with the program."},"684":{"dur":5,"text":"That is essentially the terrain that we're\noperating in here with the neuroscience of"},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"poverty."},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"Interviewer: Right."},"691":{"dur":7,"text":"And if you can't separate

course, of course."},"703":{"dur":5,"text":"So really, I make two main points in my paper\nabout this literature."},"708":{"dur":5,"text":"First, of course, I describe the literature\nand sort of all the methodological obstacles"},"714":{"dur":4,"text":"and problems that it tended, and they are\nlegion."},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"And I've hinted at some of those."},"720":{"dur":7,"text":"But the main problems, I think, here...and\nwhat leads to the misuse and the over-claiming"},"727":{"dur":3,"text":"surrounding this literature is twofold."},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"First of all, there's the causation problem."},"733":{"dur":7,"text":"So if you look at this literature, the implicit\nassumption seems to be that if we see deficits"},"741":{"dur":7,"text":"both in the brain and in behavior in children\nin poverty, then the cause of those deficits"},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"both in brain and behavior must be the poverty."},"751":{"dur":5,"text":"That is, must be these externals, these environmental\ninfluences; the disadvantage that we're all"},"757":{"dur":1,"text":"so concerned with."},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"And our society has to be what causes it."},"761":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, the correlative of that is that if we\ncould just somehow correct or cure, remove"},"765":{"dur":5,"text":"that disadvantage or alleviate it, then these\ndeficits would disappear."},"771":{"dur":6,"text":"That will be sort of the solution to the problem,\nand that follows right out of the correlation."},"777":{"dur":5,"text":"And this literature is almost exclusively\nconcerned with prevention, rather than cure"},"783":{"dur":1,"text":"after the fact."},"784":{"dur":4,"text":"Obviously, regardless of the cause, if we\nhad some kind of magic pill or bullet that"},"789":{"dur":5,"text":"would reverse these effects, it wouldn't really\nmatter how they were caused."},"794":{"dur":2,"text":"But we don't have anything like that on the\nhorizon."},"797":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, the problem with that assumption that\nthe external conditions of poverty are what"},"801":{"dur":4,"text":"cause these deficits, is that they ignore\nthe possibility of another set of causes or"},"806":{"dur":7,"text":"another avenue of causation, which is genetic\ndifferences or heritable differences, or so-called"},"813":{"dur":1,"text":"\"innate differences,\" right?"},"815":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, obviously, those innate differences are\nnot fixed."},"820":{"dur":6,"text":"There's gene-environment interaction, and\nwe know a lot about that."},"826":{"dur":5,"text":"Like the way that genes express themselves\nare affected by environment."},"831":{"dur":7,"text":"But there isn't sort of an infinite elasticity\nin the way that genes can be affected...or"},"838":{"dur":1,"text":"gene expression can be affected."},"840":{"dur":8,"text":"So for example, if part of or some of the\nfunctional deficit that we associate or see"},"848":{"dur":10,"text":"with poverty is, in fact, the product of innate\nprograms that happent to be more common difficulties."},"859":{"dur":6,"text":"Genetic traits that are more common in poor\npeople than curing poverty, that is, changing"},"865":{"dur":9,"text":"social conditions, will not necessarily bring\nthese kids up to speed, because their difficulties"},"874":{"dur":1,"text":"are innate."},"875":{"dur":6,"text":"Now, poverty may exacerbate these deficits,\nbut by hypothesis, will not be the exclusive"},"882":{"dur":1,"text":"cause."},"883":{"dur":7,"text":"So there is a kind of fallacy that potentially\noperates if we don't separate genetic causes"},"890":{"dur":3,"text":"that piece from the environmental cause."},"894":{"dur":6,"text":"And it's even more complicated because the\ngenetic substratum of some of these difficulties,"},"900":{"dur":7,"text":"and we know that a lot of these behaviors\nand traits do have genetic correspondences,"},"907":{"dur":7,"text":"or that there are genes that affect how learning\ngoes; memory abilities, reading abilities,"},"915":{"dur":1,"text":"and the like."},"916":{"dur":5,"text":"Those deficits can also operate indirectly,\nso how does that work?"},"921":{"dur":7,"text":"So we know that parenting is part of what\ncontributes to disadvantage, poor parenting."},"928":{"dur":5,"text":"But if your parents have some of the genetic\ntraits that make them poor parents, those"},"934":{"dur":2,"text":"traits will be passed on to you directly."},"936":{"dur":3,"text":"They will also affect your parents' behavior."},"940":{"dur":3,"text":"They will affect their behavior with respect\nto you as a parent."},"943":{"dur":5,"text":"They will affect their behavior in terms of\nconducting their life to try and surmount"},"949":{"dur":3,"text":"poverty or try to eliminate poverty."},"953":{"dur":5,"text":"They will affect behavior in all sorts of\nways that has a secondary effect on you as"},"958":{"dur":1,"text":"a child."},"959":{"dur":5,"text":"So there are these very complex, both primary\nand secondary interaction effects of environment"},"965":{"dur":4,"text":"and genes that I think this literature virtually\nignores."},"969":{"dur":5,"text":"When I say \"virtually,\" there will occasionally\nbe lip service paid to the possibility of"},"975":{"dur":1,"text":"a genetic influence."},"976":{"dur":4,"text":"But then in the very next paragraph, typically,\nthat will be forgotten."},"981":{"dur":6,"text":"And the discussion will go off on how all\nof these different interventions and services"},"987":{"dur":7,"text":"and programs need to be brought to bear to\nfix the problem, as if genetics really had"},"995":{"dur":1,"text":"nothing to do with it."},"997":{"dur":8,"text":"But until we disentangle the innate influences,\nthe heritable influences on conduct, behavior,"},"1005":{"dur":8,"text":"personality, cognitive and non-cognitive capacities,\nwe aren't really in the position to talk about"},"1013":{"dur":6,"text":"which environmental manipulations will affect\na change."},"1020":{"dur":6,"text":"We really should not be speaking of that because\nwe don't have the knowledge to enable us to"},"1026":{"dur":1,"text":"say anything with confidence."},"1028":{"dur":5,"text":"Interviewer: Do you detect sort of a somewhat\nforbidden element to some of the research"},"1033":{"dur":3,"text":"that would pursue the genetic or innate dimensions?"},"1036":{"dur":4,"text":"Certainly with intelligence, that can be a\nradioactive undertaking."},"1040":{"dur":7,"text":"Amy: Yes, well, I think there is definitely\na kind of backdrop, a political valence to"},"1048":{"dur":9,"text":"show much of this behavioral psychology, when\nwe start talking about what the influence"},"1058":{"dur":1,"text":"of genes is."},"1059":{"dur":6,"text":"And there's almost a schizophrenia here, because\nthe individuals who work certainly in the"},"1065":{"dur":7,"text":"field of psychometrics, who were directly\nresponsible for studying genetic inputs into"},"1073":{"dur":8,"text":"behavior, those mainstream psychometricians...they\nnever doubt that there is a genetic component"},"1081":{"dur":2,"text":"to a lot of these capacities."},"1084":{"dur":6,"text":"That's just a standard assumption or understanding\nthat comes out of the science."},"1091":{"dur":8,"text":"But on the other hand, certainly the popular\ncommentary on behavior and disadvantage and"},"1099":{"dur":5,"text":"the like, and also people who are more on\nthe behavioral side, the purely behavioral"},"1104":{"dur":10,"text":"side of developmental issues, they really\navoid or even outright deny the influence"},"1114":{"dur":6,"text":"of genetics, or they take refuge in concepts\nlike epigenetics, and really misuse those"},"1121":{"dur":5,"text":"concepts to try to convince us that there\nare no limits to what environmental manipulation"},"1126":{"dur":1,"text":"can do."},"1127":{"dur":5,"text":"And of course, none of that science stands\nfor that proposition by any means."},"1132":{"dur":7,"text":"So there are precincts in our society where\ntalking about the genetic determinants of"},"1140":{"dur":9,"text":"abilities, capacities, personality traits,\ncharacter is deeply unpopular."},"1150":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think that's why it's avoided."},"1152":{"dur":2,"text":"Interviewer: I can see that."},"1154":{"dur":7,"text":"You said in your paper that this kind of inquiry\nhas been going on for about 15 years, at least"},"1162":{"dur":1,"text":"a good decade."},"1163":{"dur":5,"text":"Do some of the people are starting to realize,\n\"Well, there's just really a lot of limits"},"1169":{"dur":1,"text":"to what we can do\"?"},"1170":{"dur":2,"text":"Or are they barreling ahead and optimistic?"},"1173":{"dur":8,"text":"Amy: Well, once again, I think the course...people\nwho actually do the science recognize that"},"1181":{"dur":6,"text":"they're just at the beginning of their journey,\nso to speak, and then see the obstacles to"},"1188":{"dur":9,"text":"a more reticulated sort of finally dissected\napproach to the brain, both to causation and"},"1197":{"dur":1,"text":"to structure and function."},"1199":{"dur":1,"text":"And I mean, they're tremendous."},"1200":{"dur":7,"text":"And yet, they're still plugging ahead trying\nto incrementally advance the field and I think"},"1207":{"dur":2,"text":"that's just fine."},"1209":{"dur":5,"text":"But they have their moments...they're
