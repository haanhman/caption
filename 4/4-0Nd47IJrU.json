that when you're observing someone else..."},"808":{"dur":4,"text":"..making facial movements\nyou have small automatic imitation..."},"813":{"dur":0,"text":"..of those

it turns out that..."},"939":{"dur":5,"text":"professional basketball players can better predict \nthe outcome of a basketball player's action."},"944":{"dur":2,"text":"But in this particular study,\n they were worried that..."},"947":{"dur":2,"text":"basketball players not only\n have greater motor experise,"},"949":{"dur":3,"text":"but they've also spent much of their lives\nwatching people
