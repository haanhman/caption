{"5":{"dur":1,"text":">>Rich Hyndman: Hi there."},"6":{"dur":2,"text":"Welcome to this talk on Google Play Services."},"8":{"dur":1,"text":"My name is Richard Hyndman."},"10":{"dur":2,"text":"I head up Android developer relations across\nEurope."},"12":{"dur":3,"text":">>Reto Meier: And I'm Reto Meier, the Android\ndeveloper operations tech lead."},"15":{"dur":1,"text":">>Rich Hyndman: Excellent."},"16":{"dur":3,"text":"And together we are clearly the Android developer\nrelations football team."},"20":{"dur":2,"text":"We'll take on any other developer relations\nteam if they want it."},"23":{"dur":1,"text":">>Reto Meier: That is a challenge."},"24":{"dur":5,"text":">>Rich Hyndman: Let's start with what is Google\nPlay Services, a little bit of background"},"30":{"dur":2,"text":"to this."},"32":{"dur":5,"text":"Google Play Services is a single library that\nbrings together all the APIs for Google services"},"37":{"dur":8,"text":"and play services into a single place on Android\ndevices, Android devices version 2.2 and above."},"45":{"dur":4,"text":"This means that you can implement your applications\nand we can implement our applications without"},"50":{"dur":3,"text":"having to worry about device support."},"53":{"dur":5,"text":"This is the fifth major release we've done\nof Google Play Services and we've become exceedingly"},"59":{"dur":1,"text":"efficient at it."},"60":{"dur":3,"text":"If you hadn't all been on the same Wi-Fi network\nover the last 24 hours I would be sure that"},"64":{"dur":2,"text":"you've all got it on your devices already."},"66":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe conference situations change that a\nlittle bit."},"69":{"dur":3,"text":"So Google Play Services is covering Google+,\nGoogle+ sign-in, maps."},"73":{"dur":3,"text":"Hopefully you have used it already."},"76":{"dur":2,"text":"And OAuth."},"79":{"dur":6,"text":"What I mean by authentication is that Google\nPlay Services provides a single authorization"},"85":{"dur":4,"text":"API for you to get access to all of our services\nthrough the library."},"89":{"dur":7,"text":"You and your users have a consistent way to\nreceive OAuth access tokens for Google services,"},"97":{"dur":4,"text":"but even more than that Google Play Services\nis such a core part of our platform for the"},"101":{"dur":3,"text":"Google ecosystem that we need to make sure\nit's always up to date."},"105":{"dur":3,"text":"We need to make sure that we can do bug fixes\nand updates outside of the Android framework"},"108":{"dur":2,"text":"releases and outside of the carrier release\nschedule."},"110":{"dur":2,"text":"So of course, it's updated through the Play\nStore."},"113":{"dur":3,"text":"Why is it on Android 2.2 and above?"},"116":{"dur":6,"text":"Android 2.2 and above is now 98.2 and growing\npercentage of the active Android users that"},"122":{"dur":1,"text":"hit the Play Store."},"124":{"dur":5,"text":"Also FroYo added some really handy API, things\nlike saving applications to mass storage,"},"129":{"dur":3,"text":"and these are the things that most applications\nthat use play services are probably going"},"133":{"dur":1,"text":"to be using."},"134":{"dur":5,"text":"A few people have asked why we have both play\nservices and the Android support library."},"140":{"dur":2,"text":">>Reto Meier: I have been wondering."},"142":{"dur":2,"text":">>Rich Hyndman: You will know that it's in\nthe name."},"145":{"dur":4,"text":"Really Google Play Services is, of course,\nsupporting our play ecosystem, making sure"},"149":{"dur":1,"text":"you can use the APIs."},"150":{"dur":3,"text":"The Android support library is an open source\nlibrary for the Android ecosystem and for"},"154":{"dur":5,"text":"you the developers to include in your applications\nin the source and you can use it on all your"},"160":{"dur":3,"text":"devices that you would like to."},"163":{"dur":5,"text":"So this talk is called what's new in Google\nPlay Services, so let's get into some of the"},"168":{"dur":1,"text":"meat of it."},"169":{"dur":1,"text":"Mr. Meier."},"170":{"dur":3,"text":">>Reto Meier: So you heard a lot about things\nrelated to Google Play Services during the"},"174":{"dur":4,"text":"keynote yesterday and there are deep dive\npresentations for pretty much everything in"},"179":{"dur":3,"text":"Google Play Services, both the things which\nwe have just released and the things that"},"182":{"dur":1,"text":"have been around for a little while."},"184":{"dur":4,"text":"So the thing here is not to dive too deeply\ninto an individual thing, but to give you"},"189":{"dur":3,"text":"a bit of an overview into the things you may\nbe interested in seeing, particularly if you"},"192":{"dur":4,"text":"haven't had a chance to go into all the other\nGoogle Play Services sessions so far at I\/O."},"197":{"dur":4,"text":"So let's look at some of the exciting new\nfeatures that we've just released here at"},"202":{"dur":1,"text":"I\/O 2013."},"203":{"dur":6,"text":"And I think the one that is the most interesting\nand exciting for me is location-based services."},"210":{"dur":3,"text":"So in addition to the maps fragments and the\nmaps V2 stuff that we added traditional previously"},"214":{"dur":4,"text":"we now have the ability to detect location\nwithin Google Play Services."},"218":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's a reason we brought this in here."},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"We're now able to do much cleverer things."},"223":{"dur":4,"text":"We have a new fused location provider which\ndoes all of the hard work for you."},"228":{"dur":4,"text":"So if you've ever used location in your Android,\nand I'm sure most of you have, you know that"},"232":{"dur":4,"text":"doing so in a way that's efficient while still\nallowing you to get the best location results"},"237":{"dur":1,"text":"can be quite tedious."},"238":{"dur":5,"text":"There's a lot of code you have to write in\norder to be able to use those best practices."},"243":{"dur":3,"text":"So what the location team have done is taken\nall of that hard work, they've put it all"},"246":{"dur":4,"text":"behind the scenes, behind this fused location\nprovider, and it will do all of that stuff"},"251":{"dur":1,"text":"for you."},"252":{"dur":3,"text":"It will detect which providers are available,\nit will figure out when things are turned"},"255":{"dur":3,"text":"on, when things are turned off, which providers\nare providing the best result at a time particular"},"259":{"dur":1,"text":"time."},"260":{"dur":1,"text":"All of that hard work is done for you."},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"And to use it is actually nice and easy."},"264":{"dur":6,"text":"Like most of the Google Play Services clients,\nyou simply have to create the instance first,"},"270":{"dur":4,"text":"call connect and it will asynchronously bind\nyour service or application to the Google"},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"Play Services service."},"278":{"dur":3,"text":"Once that's happened you're able to treat\nthat location client in exactly the same way"},"281":{"dur":5,"text":"you used to handle the old location-based\nservices client."},"286":{"dur":4,"text":"And this looks a lot like the naive approach\nthat we used to do back in the olden days,"},"291":{"dur":1,"text":"last week."},"292":{"dur":4,"text":"We had to specify what our interval was and\nwe had to say what provider we wanted to use"},"297":{"dur":1,"text":"to get the location updates."},"298":{"dur":6,"text":"And in most cases we were usually using multiple\nproviders or letting the system determine"},"304":{"dur":5,"text":"which provider we wanted, but then you have\nthis problem because GPS is always the best,"},"310":{"dur":1,"text":"right?"},"311":{"dur":1,"text":"It's always the most accurate location."},"313":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, it is when you're outside, but less\nso when you're inside, so now you're having"},"316":{"dur":3,"text":"to keep track of all the different providers\nand figure out which is the most appropriate"},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"for your current location."},"322":{"dur":3,"text":"Fused location provider does all of that work\nfor you."},"325":{"dur":5,"text":"You just give us an interval, it can be a\nminimum interval or a maximum interval, and"},"330":{"dur":1,"text":"then tell us what your priority is."},"332":{"dur":1,"text":"What's more important?"},"333":{"dur":3,"text":"Do you want to get the most accurate results\nthat you can or do you want to make sure that"},"336":{"dur":4,"text":"the battery lasts as long as possible or do\nyou want to leave it up to us and ask fused"},"340":{"dur":2,"text":"location provider to try and find the right\nbalance for you?"},"343":{"dur":3,"text":"Because no matter what you choose, we're always\ngoing to try to get the most accurate result"},"347":{"dur":1,"text":"with the least battery."},"349":{"dur":6,"text":"This is just our way of knowing which way\nto push it, in which direction."},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's one of the big advantages in fused\nlocation provider."},"357":{"dur":7,"text":"And the other thing is we have the logic behind\nthat at any time as part of Google Play Services"},"365":{"dur":3,"text":"and we can push that on our users' devices\nwithout you having to do anything."},"369":{"dur":4,"text":"You don't have to recompile code, you simply\nset the things once and we will continue to"},"373":{"dur":6,"text":"try to make the results more accurate and\nmore efficient with each release."},"380":{"dur":4,"text":"Not satisfied with just improving all of our\nlocation-based apps, the location team have"},"384":{"dur":4,"text":"also created a new geofencing API."},"388":{"dur":4,"text":"This works a lot like we expected the old\nproximity alerts to work, but this actually"},"393":{"dur":1,"text":"works."},"394":{"dur":4,"text":"So it will keep track of all the geofences\nfrom every application and figure out which"},"398":{"dur":5,"text":"of our providers we should be using based\non how far away we are from the boundaries"},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"around each of those geofences."},"404":{"dur":5,"text":"So we create those boundaries simply by specifying\na particular location and a radius around"},"410":{"dur":6,"text":"it and whether we're interested in users who\nmove into or out of or both of that boundary"},"416":{"dur":1,"text":"condition."},"417":{"dur":4,"text":"And so because this is all handled by the\ncentral fused location provider, all of the"},"422":{"dur":5,"text":"geofences from every app are known to us and\nso we can figure out what should we be using."},"427":{"dur":3,"text":"Should we stick with GPS, should we go back\nto cell ID because we're far enough?"},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"Because we know how far we are from the boundaries."},"432":{"dur":4,"text":"This means you get to take advantage of all\nthis contextual information around location"},"437":{"dur":5,"text":"without having to follow the user every step\nof the way, without the complex analysis to"},"442":{"dur":5,"text":"figure out whether you want to turn on GPS\nor turn on cell or Wi-Fi triangulation or"},"448":{"dur":1,"text":"any other technology that is made available."},"450":{"dur":4,"text":"We do all of that hard work for you and want\nto be sure you are notified whenever it is"},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"relevant."},"456":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, because the location team are overachievers,\nnever really satisfied with just making things"},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"better and making things work, they've decided\nthat they want to introduce something completely"},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"new."},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"And so now we have activity recognition."},"469":{"dur":5,"text":"So now not only can we tell where a user is,\nbut we can tell what they're actually doing."},"474":{"dur":3,"text":"So we know whether they're standing still,\nwhether they're running, whether they're cycling,"},"478":{"dur":1,"text":"whether they're driving."},"479":{"dur":4,"text":"And now you can use this information either\nto create entire new categories of apps."},"483":{"dur":4,"text":"You could have an app, say a fitness app,\nand rather than having to say what activity"},"488":{"dur":3,"text":"you're doing, the activity detection can tell\nyou."},"491":{"dur":4,"text":"Activity recognition can figure out exactly\nwhat they're doing and fill in those details."},"496":{"dur":5,"text":"So you can use it that way, and this is how\nyou request those activity updates."},"501":{"dur":4,"text":"You simply set what interval you're interested\nin and then specify pending intent that is"},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"going to get triggered whenever the activity\nchanges."},"509":{"dur":1,"text":"So now we can be clever about this."},"510":{"dur":3,"text":"We can say, okay, maybe we're just interested\nin all the changes so we can track that and"},"514":{"dur":4,"text":"do something useful or maybe we can make our\napps more efficient."},"518":{"dur":4,"text":"We can provide a different user experience\nbased on what their current activity is."},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"So maybe it's looking for points of interest\nnearby."},"526":{"dur":4,"text":"If we're standing still, we're not moving,\nthe buildings aren't moving, then we can pause,"},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"we can disable those updates."},"532":{"dur":3,"text":"If we're in the car we want to get the updates\nas quickly as possible so the passenger can"},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"figure out a good place to eat."},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"Or maybe you can flip it around."},"539":{"dur":4,"text":"Maybe it's sports scores or news, you're standing\nstill, and that's when you want the most frequent"},"544":{"dur":1,"text":"updates."},"545":{"dur":4,"text":"And when you're cycling, the phone is in your\npocket, you may as well disable those updates"},"549":{"dur":5,"text":"because if you're not in a position to look\nat your phone there's no point in firing up"},"554":{"dur":3,"text":"the cell radio in order to get those downloads."},"557":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's really a way that you can utilize\nthis information to create entirely new apps"},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"or more efficient apps."},"562":{"dur":5,"text":"It is a brand new API, so it's a really great\nopportunity to think outside the box, to figure"},"568":{"dur":5,"text":"out how can you use this new sensor information\nto create a better experience, more efficient"},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"experience for your users."},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, I'm not going to go into any more detail\nhere."},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"Like I said, we want to cover everything pretty\nquickly."},"581":{"dur":6,"text":"The good news is that Waleed and Jaikumar\nhave already presented all of this information"},"588":{"dur":5,"text":"and if we had a time travel API built into\nAndroid and Google Play Services you could"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"go back in time and watch it live earlier\ntoday."},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"Unfortunately that's not going to be possible."},"598":{"dur":3,"text":">>Rich Hyndman: But they released that back\nin time, time travel delay."},"601":{"dur":1,"text":">>Reto Meier: No."},"602":{"dur":1,"text":">>Rich Hyndman: It's not far."},"603":{"dur":1,"text":"It's only 11:15."},"604":{"dur":1,"text":">>Reto Meier: We'll talk about this later."},"606":{"dur":2,"text":">>Rich Hyndman: Secret stuff."},"609":{"dur":2,"text":">>Reto Meier: So check it out on YouTube."},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"It's close enough."},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"You can rewind time effectively and see all\nthe information."},"615":{"dur":4,"text":"They dig much deeper into the details of how\nthis is done, what you can do to really take"},"619":{"dur":5,"text":"advantage of all of these APIs within your\napplications."},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"Anything else that you want to talk about\ntoday, Rich?"},"626":{"dur":1,"text":">>Rich Hyndman: Sure."},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"Of course we have something else."},"628":{"dur":3,"text":"We have the thing that I'm most impressed\nwith in the latest set of Google Play Services"},"631":{"dur":1,"text":"is Google Play games."},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"Everything is better when it's competitive,\nright?"},"636":{"dur":3,"text":"Hopefully some of you have already been playing\nthe new Google Play games."},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"You've seen the enormous leaderboard outside."},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"Is anyone on the leaderboard?"},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"No?"},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"One or two people at the back."},"646":{"dur":1,"text":"That's good stuff."},"647":{"dur":1,"text":">>Reto Meier: They're just shy."},"648":{"dur":4,"text":">>Rich Hyndman: So the things we're talking\nabout with Google Play games, achievements,"},"653":{"dur":3,"text":"leaderboards, cloud save and real-time multiplayer\ninvitations."},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"Because what is multiplayer without invitations?"},"658":{"dur":1,"text":">>Reto Meier: It's a game by yourself."},"660":{"dur":3,"text":">>Rich Hyndman: It's not multiplayer."},"664":{"dur":4,"text":"So you may know how all this performs, but\ndo you manage all of this great new stuff?"},"668":{"dur":3,"text":"Inside the new Google developer console you\nwill get a little tab in the top left corner,"},"672":{"dur":3,"text":"the little play games logo, and you can tap\non that and then from inside the new layouts"},"675":{"dur":4,"text":"you will see the ability to add in your leaderboards,\nyour achievements and things like that straight"},"680":{"dur":4,"text":"into the play developer console across platforms\nthat supports iOS and Web."},"685":{"dur":5,"text":"Not only that, but if you have a look in the\nPlay Store now at Beach Buggy Blitz, if you"},"690":{"dur":4,"text":"scroll down you will see it supports leaderboards\nand achievements."},"695":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't think that one is multiplayer."},"697":{"dur":4,"text":"But users are going to know which of the play\nservices you've integrated into your application"},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"before they install it."},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"Just adding a bit more compelling."},"706":{"dur":4,"text":"So inside the actual game we provide you with\ndefault look and feel for achievements."},"711":{"dur":4,"text":"You can see the little dialogue that appears,\nand the entire achievement screen."},"716":{"dur":3,"text":"So you can just drop this in straight away\nif you want."},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"Drop it in, it will work fine for you."},"721":{"dur":4,"text":"Or you can get access to the raw data and\nintegrate it as you previously would, make"},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"it look and feel like your application."},"728":{"dur":1,"text":"The same applies to leaderboards."},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"Again, there's a default look and feel for\nthe leaderboards, if you want, and users will"},"733":{"dur":4,"text":"recognize it and understand that it's Google\nplay games or you can get access to the leaderboards,"},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"and Hugo hopefully won't be at the top."},"740":{"dur":5,"text":"So now you have leaderboards, you have achievements\nthat are going to follow you around from device"},"745":{"dur":1,"text":"to device."},"747":{"dur":3,"text":"So it only makes sense if with those achievements\nyou're following your game state with you."},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"What you really need is some sort of Cloud\nSave service."},"754":{"dur":1,"text":">>> What would you call something like that?"},"755":{"dur":1,"text":">>Rich Hyndman: I don't know."},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"We call ours the Cloud Save service."},"758":{"dur":6,"text":"So with Cloud Save you now have four 128K\nblocks of data that you can store the user's"},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"data in for that application."},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"Unfortunately this huge chunk of data doesn't\ncome out of their drive space."},"769":{"dur":1,"text":">>Reto Meier: That's lucky."},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"It's almost half a meg per game."},"772":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a lot."},"774":{"dur":6,"text":">>Rich Hyndman: So you get this chunk of data\nthat doesn't come out of the drive space,"},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"you synchronize the state maybe for the four\nchunks."},"783":{"dur":4,"text":"You could have one chunk for avatar, another\nchunk for their profile information, game"},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"progress, things like that, store them and\nsynchronize them."},"791":{"dur":4,"text":"Cloud Save also comes with conflict resolution\nstrategies as well."},"795":{"dur":3,"text":"If you want to find out more about that, again,\ngo back to yesterday this time."},"798":{"dur":1,"text":"We certainly haven't released that API."},"800":{"dur":2,"text":"And watch new developments in mobile gaming."},"802":{"dur":3,"text":">>Reto Meier: That seems like a really simple\ntitle."},"806":{"dur":3,"text":">>Rich Hyndman: Who would actually call it\nnew developments in mobile gaming if you had"},"809":{"dur":1,"text":"to go something to hide?"},"810":{"dur":3,"text":"It was called an introduction to play games\nservices."},"814":{"dur":3,"text":"So in the future when this comes out on YouTube,\nlook for introduction to play games services"},"817":{"dur":3,"text":"and you will find out more details about all\nof that."},"821":{"dur":3,"text":"Maybe unsurprisingly this is all backed by\nGoogle+ so you add the Google+ sign into your"},"825":{"dur":5,"text":"application and then you get access to all\nthese fantastic play services."},"831":{"dur":1,"text":"For even more details there's another one."},"832":{"dur":1,"text":"There's a lot of play games to what's going\non."},"834":{"dur":1,"text":">>Reto Meier: There were a few."},"835":{"dur":3,"text":">>Rich Hyndman: Advanced games development\ntopics, which sounds like a cloaked talk title,"},"838":{"dur":1,"text":"but I didn't go and check."},"839":{"dur":1,"text":"So now we've backed up all our data up."},"841":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's restore Reto's former position and see\nwhat's next."},"844":{"dur":5,"text":">>Reto Meier: So one of the other really exciting\nnew parts of Google Play Services, most of"},"850":{"dur":4,"text":"the ones I'm talking about today, actually\nexisted in the world before Google Play Services,"},"854":{"dur":2,"text":"but have recently been brought into the fold."},"856":{"dur":2,"text":"And that is certainly the case for Google\nCloud Messaging."},"859":{"dur":5,"text":"This is already an API, which hopefully many\nof you are very familiar with, to help make"},"864":{"dur":2,"text":"your travel transfers that much more efficient."},"866":{"dur":4,"text":"We've pulled that into Google Play Services\nand as part of the introduction process we"},"871":{"dur":3,"text":"forced the team to build some new APIs as\nwell."},"874":{"dur":4,"text":"So hopefully you're all very familiar with\nthe basics behind Google Cloud Messaging,"},"879":{"dur":5,"text":"and that's the fact that you can have your\nserver update your client to tell it when"},"884":{"dur":1,"text":"it needs to do a refresh."},"886":{"dur":6,"text":"So in the bad old days we used to set repeating\nalarms and at best maybe they were inexact"},"892":{"dur":4,"text":"repeating alarms, but either way you were\nstill waking up the device, turning on the"},"897":{"dur":4,"text":"radio, pinging a server just to say, hey,\nis there anything I need to download?"},"901":{"dur":1,"text":"And most of the times the answer was no."},"902":{"dur":4,"text":"And even if the answer is yes, it was like,\nyeah, two hours ago would have been useful."},"907":{"dur":4,"text":"So what Google Cloud Messaging lets you do\nis have the server notify each of your clients"},"911":{"dur":4,"text":"when it's time, when there is new data, so\nyou can reduce the amount of radio traffic,"},"916":{"dur":4,"text":"reduce the amount of battery use associated\nwith those transfers by only making them happen"},"920":{"dur":3,"text":"when you know there is data to transfer."},"924":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, one of the exciting new things that we've\nadded is the ability to go the other way around."},"929":{"dur":3,"text":"So as you heard in the keynote yesterday we\ncan now have a system where you can create"},"932":{"dur":5,"text":"a persistent XMPP connection with your server\nand the Google Cloud Messaging server."},"938":{"dur":3,"text":"This gives you now the ability to send messages\nfrom your device back to your server over"},"942":{"dur":4,"text":"this connection without you having to maintain\nthat consistent connection using something"},"946":{"dur":2,"text":"like a hanging GAC or something equivalent\nto that."},"949":{"dur":4,"text":"We'll do it once and we do it in a way that\nwe know is going to work across carriers and"},"954":{"dur":4,"text":"be as efficient as possible and give you the\nability to have the low latency, that high"},"959":{"dur":5,"text":"reliability connection to send data backwards\nand forwards without having you to do yourself,"},"964":{"dur":3,"text":"using infrastructure that we use for all of\nour services."},"967":{"dur":1,"text":"And you can take it a step further as well."},"969":{"dur":5,"text":"So you can use this same technology to now\nsend messages from one -- from your app running"},"975":{"dur":3,"text":"on one device to the same app running on other\ndevices."},"978":{"dur":5,"text":"So if you have things like a notification\nand it pops up someone's phone and they swipe"},"984":{"dur":4,"text":"it to dismiss or snooze it, but that same\nnotification is now going to be transmitted"},"988":{"dur":2,"text":"to all of your other phones."},"990":{"dur":4,"text":"So what this API lets you do is basically\nsend that message to say the user has handled"},"995":{"dur":2,"text":"it, it has been actioned, you can remove it."},"997":{"dur":1,"text":"This is really nice."},"998":{"dur":4,"text":"This is a great way of demonstrating to people\nthat your app is aware of the ecosystem, it"},"1003":{"dur":2,"text":"knows it has more than one phone."},"1005":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not just an app that runs on all of these\ndevices."},"1007":{"dur":1,"text":"It's built around them."},"1009":{"dur":2,"text":"It understands who they are and what their\nneeds are."},"1011":{"dur":3,"text":"So by doing that it just works the way that\npeople expect it should."},"1015":{"dur":5,"text":"I've already dismissed this notification,\nit shouldn't appear anywhere else."},"1021":{"dur":2,"text":"Implementation from the

the jar file."},"1223":{"dur":5,"text":"So you need to import the module as a project,\nfirst of all, for Play services, and then"},"1228":{"dur":4,"text":"also import the jar file as a library

going to have a maven artifact for"},"1244":{"dur":4,"text":"Play service, so with the Gradle build system,\nit will do the dependency management for you."},"1249":{"dur":2,"text":"Eclipse, very similar flow."},"1251":{"dur":3,"text":"You're going to through, you're going to copy\nPlay services library into your work space,"},"1254":{"dur":2,"text":"you're going to import that."},"1257":{"dur":2,"text":"Also import the panorama sample."},"1259":{"dur":2,"text":"In Eclipse you just need to make the one dependency."},"1261":{"dur":6,"text":"You make the dependency from

this one in Eclipse."},"1276":{"dur":4,"text":"Of course some of our services like Maps use\nAPIs and API keys as well, and Reto is going"},"1280":{"dur":1,"text":"to tell you how to get hold of an API key."},"1282":{"dur":3,"text":">>Reto Meier: Thanks, Rich."},"1286":{"dur":5,"text":"So the way this works is that you need to\nstart by going to the API console, and you"},"1291":{"dur":5,"text":"can find that at code.google.com\/apis\/console,\nwhich is tricky for a lot of us to remember"},"1297":{"dur":2,"text":"because my default is always to go to developer.android.com."},"1299":{"dur":4,"text":"But nonetheless, if you go there, you can\ngo into the services where you'll see a long"},"1304":{"dur":4,"text":"list of APIs, and you simply choose the ones\nyou want to utilize, and turn it on."},"1309":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's actually pretty straightforward."},"1312":{"dur":3,"text":"Of course if we just gave you an API key which\nyou could

could\neasily start eating all of yours."},"1330":{"dur":5,"text":"So to mitigate against that, we make sure\nthat all the keys that we have are linked"},"1336":{"dur":4,"text":"to a particular certificate and particular\npackage name so that only you can use your"},"1340":{"dur":1,"text":"API key."},"1341":{"dur":4,"text":"And that way you can get full control over\nthe list of apps and certificates you want"},"1346":{"dur":3,"text":"in the API access part of the console."},"1349":{"dur":6,"text":"Now, once you've gone through that process,\nthat is going to give you an API key."},"1356":{"dur":3,"text":"This, because it's signed or at least it's\nassociated specifically with your certificate"},"1360":{"dur":4,"text":"and your package name is unique, you can put\nit into

but hey, there you go."},"1418":{"dur":4,"text":"Now with Google Play services you can get\nhold of these tokens much more easily."},"1422":{"dur":2,"text":"So it starts off with choosing an

before, where they can choose one of"},"1438":{"dur":1,"text":"their Gmail accounts."},"1439":{"dur":2,"text":"Just one line of code."},"1442":{"dur":3,"text":"Then before you go ahead and use Google

people could do that if they really\nfelt like it was necessary for some reason."},"1454":{"dur":1,"text":"And then again, that's just one line of code."},"1455":{"dur":3,"text":"Google Play services
