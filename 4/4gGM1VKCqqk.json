years."},"1084":{"dur":2,"text":"He lived with me from\nwhen I brought him back,"},"1087":{"dur":2,"text":"but he just got too\nold too quick last year"},"1090":{"dur":2,"text":"and we had to let him\ngo, which is just, yeah."},"1092":{"dur":1,"text":"- But a life well-lived for him."},"1094":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, his latter part of his life"},"1095":{"dur":1,"text":"I think was definitely

well,"},"1124":{"dur":1,"text":"you know, supporters from America."},"1126":{"dur":2,"text":"So, we're trying to do\nthree different time zones"},"1128":{"dur":1,"text":"and manage all that."},"1130":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, it does get crazy busy,"},"1131":{"dur":3,"text":"but we're achieving something\nand that's sometimes"},"1134":{"dur":3,"text":"when you do get

Indeed you have."},"1142":{"dur":1,"text":"Another one of the unique\ninitiatives you have"},"1144":{"dur":3,"text":"is that women, it hasn't happened here"},"1147":{"dur":3,"text":"in the United

it"},"1162":{"dur":1,"text":"(Yvonne laughs)\nask the women, say, right,"},"1164":{"dur":2,"text":"if you give me your bras I\ncan turn that into money."},"1166":{"dur":1,"text":"(Yvonne laughs)"},"1167":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah, a friend of mine, I\nwas having a beer with him"},"1170":{"dur":3,"text":"one evening and he was\njust talking about charity"},"1173":{"dur":0,"text":"and how it was going."},"1174":{"dur":1,"text":"I said, oh, we just desperately need"},"1175":{"dur":1,"text":"to find more ways of fundraising,"},"1176":{"dur":3,"text":"and he said, oh, I've seen\nthis thing where people"},"1180":{"dur":2,"text":"can send their bras in and\ncharities get money for it."},"1183":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was like, right,\nokay, how's that gonna work?"},"1185":{"dur":0,"text":"(Yvonne laughs)"},"1186":{"dur":1,"text":"and actually we looked into it"},"1187":{"dur":1,"text":"and realized, yep, there\nwas an organization"},"1189":{"dur":2,"text":"that would pay us money\nif we collected the bras."},"1192":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we just put it\nout there as a kind of"},"1194":{"dur":2,"text":"a jokey thing and it just picked off."},"1196":{"dur":2,"text":"It picked up so much\nthat we were getting bras"},"1199":{"dur":2,"text":"from all over the country,\npeople sending them in."},"1201":{"dur":1,"text":"And what happens to them actually"},"1203":{"dur":2,"text":"is this company will buy them off of us"},"1205":{"dur":1,"text":"and then they take them to Africa"},"1207":{"dur":1,"text":"and they distribute them\nthere to, obviously,"},"1209":{"dur":1,"text":"the women that desperately need them."},"1210":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Yvonne] Another win-win."},"1212":{"dur":2,"text":"But our office currently now is just full"},"1215":{"dur":1,"text":"(Yvonne laughs)"},"1217":{"dur":2,"text":"It's made quite a bit of\nmoney for the charity,"},"1219":{"dur":1,"text":"so it's something that's\nwell worth it to us."},"1220":{"dur":1,"text":"- And is that something\nyou'd like to see happen"},"1222":{"dur":1,"text":"here in the States as well?"},"1223":{"dur":0,"text":"- We would love to, yeah."},"1224":{"dur":2,"text":"We just need to find that\ncompany that's willing"},"1226":{"dur":2,"text":"to help out with that bit of\nactually donating the money"},"1229":{"dur":2,"text":"for the bras to then get them to Africa."},"1231":{"dur":1,"text":"But yeah, it's something\nwe are looking into,"},"1233":{"dur":1,"text":"and, obviously, the recycling products."},"1235":{"dur":2,"text":"Again, in England we'll collect old stamps"},"1237":{"dur":2,"text":"and we can recycle them\nfor

the\nsoldiers are going through"},"1260":{"dur":2,"text":"and why they actually start looking after"},"1262":{"dur":1,"text":"their dog or cat."},"1263":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'm sure that will\nbring a tear to their eye"},"1267":{"dur":1,"text":"and just if they could spread that word"},"1268":{"dur":1,"text":"and let somebody else\nknow who's a dog person"},"1270":{"dur":2,"text":"or is involved with the military"},"1272":{"dur":2,"text":"and just let them know\nand share the story."},"1275":{"dur":2,"text":"- I would imagine that\nsome of this can get"},"1277":{"dur":2,"text":"pretty heavy on your heart with some"},"1279":{"dur":1,"text":"of the things that you've\nseen and experienced."},"1281":{"dur":3,"text":"What do you do for relief and recreation?"},"1284":{"dur":2,"text":"- (laughs) Myself and Hannah"},"1287":{"dur":2,"text":"were actually talking\nabout that not too long ago"},"1289":{"dur":1,"text":"'cause we're probably very bad"},"1290":{"dur":2,"text":"at actually giving ourselves time off"},"1293":{"dur":2,"text":"and when we do have time off we sit there"},"1295":{"dur":0,"text":"and then suddenly the conversation"},"1296":{"dur":1,"text":"will come back to

climbing."},"1308":{"dur":2,"text":"So, that's kinda my way of de-stressing,"},"1310":{"dur":2,"text":"I suppose, if I can, yeah."},"1312":{"dur":3,"text":"- And is the joy in the climb\nor is the joy at the top?"},"1315":{"dur":2,"text":"- In the climb, definitely in the climb."},"1318":{"dur":2,"text":"There's just no mobile phones, no nothing,"},"1321":{"dur":2,"text":"and you're just totally\nconcentrating on what you're doing"},"1323":{"dur":3,"text":"so it's a way for me of\nswitching off, I think, yeah."},"1327":{"dur":2,"text":"- Well, it has been a great\npleasure to speak with you"},"1330":{"dur":1,"text":"and to learn more about Nowzad Dogs."},"1332":{"dur":2,"text":"I wish you continued success\nin your organization."},"1335":{"dur":1,"text":"Give me real quick again
