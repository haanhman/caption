representative of the team."},"495":{"dur":3,"text":"So with that, I\nwanted to first go"},"499":{"dur":3,"text":"into some scientific\nconcepts that"},"502":{"dur":4,"text":"describe how it is that you get\nclean water from the treatment"},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"plant all the way to\nthe consumer's tap,"},"510":{"dur":3,"text":"because these concepts are\nimportant to understand"},"513":{"dur":4,"text":"the current and past problems\nof the Flint water system."},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"The first important\nconcept is the idea"},"520":{"dur":4,"text":"of a protective scale that\nforms on the wall of pipes."},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"So the current\ncorrosion control that's"},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"been used in Flint\nright now-- and this"},"529":{"dur":3,"text":"was implemented by the A-team at\nthe US Environmental Protection"},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"Agency as well as the\nstate of Michigan--"},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"is called orthophosphate\ncorrosion control."},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is what Flint\nwas using for decades"},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"before the switch to\nthe Flint river water"},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"and dosing of\northophosphate was stopped."},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"And the way this works is\nthat the orthophosphate reacts"},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"with materials that are\non the wall of the pipe,"},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"whether it's lead or\niron, and it forms a very"},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"protective coating."},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"And what this coating does\nis that it protects the water"},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"from the pipe corrosion."},"564":{"dur":3,"text":"And it also protects the\npipes from the water."},"568":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is essential."},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"And so one of the key things\nto helping the system recover"},"573":{"dur":4,"text":"is to form this orthophosphate\nmetal lining on the pipes"},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"throughout the system."},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"And of course that\nrequires flowing water."},"582":{"dur":4,"text":"We have to get water with the\northophosphate into the system"},"586":{"dur":3,"text":"and allow it to\ncontact the pipe."},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"The second, and another\nvery important element"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"of a healthy\ndistribution system,"},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"is the issue of deposits."},"597":{"dur":1,"text":"And in Flint's\nwater system, they"},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"have a very big system for\nthe amount of people that"},"602":{"dur":1,"text":"are currently left in Flint."},"604":{"dur":1,"text":"And what happens\nover the years is"},"606":{"dur":3,"text":"that loose lead\nand iron rusts have"},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"accumulated inside these pipes."},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"And the way the\nwater is currently"},"614":{"dur":3,"text":"being used-- relatively low flow\nvolumes, relatively low flow"},"618":{"dur":3,"text":"rates-- we have learned\nin the past few months"},"622":{"dur":3,"text":"that it's probably going to\ntake months or years to get"},"626":{"dur":4,"text":"these deposits out of the pipes\nand to clean these pipes up."},"630":{"dur":1,"text":"And so this is one\nof the concepts"},"632":{"dur":3,"text":"that we're going to be promoting\ntoday and in the months"},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"ahead, in collaboration\nwith the EPA and the state,"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"is that if we want to\nhelp the system recover,"},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"we have to get water\nmoving through these pipes"},"644":{"dur":3,"text":"to speed up the rate at which\nthese loose deposits are"},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"removed into the water."},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is going to require\nmore volume of water moving"},"652":{"dur":4,"text":"through the system and also, in\nsome cases, higher velocities"},"656":{"dur":3,"text":"to clean those deposits\nout of the pipe."},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"And the hope is that\nif we implement this,"},"663":{"dur":3,"text":"the system will recover in\na few weeks, or a month,"},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"as opposed to the months\nor years time frame"},"669":{"dur":4,"text":"that I mentioned previously\nunder existing flow rates."},"673":{"dur":3,"text":"The third and final point is\nthat to have a healthy drinking"},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"water distribution\nsystem, you have"},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"to make sure that bacteria\nare under control."},"682":{"dur":3,"text":"The bacteria are the source\nof the possible Legionnaires'"},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"disease outbreak that was\nassociated with a switch"},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"to Flint River."},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"And of course the way\nwe do that in Flint"},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"is through use of free chlorine."},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"And so again, the\ngeneral idea is"},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"that the chlorine is added\nat the water treatment plant"},"699":{"dur":3,"text":"and we have to get that to\ncontact the wall of the pipes"},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"to make sure that the\nbiofilm is under control."},"706":{"dur":3,"text":"That will prevent a\nlot of taste, odors,"},"709":{"dur":3,"text":"bacteria problems, which\ninclude Legionella."},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"So for all three of\nthese perspectives"},"714":{"dur":1,"text":"of having a healthy\ndistribution system,"},"716":{"dur":1,"text":"we have to move\nmore volume of water"},"718":{"dur":3,"text":"through the system\nat higher velocities."},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's going to\nbe one of the bases"},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"for our recommendations later."},"726":{"dur":1,"text":"So with that I will\nnow turn this over"},"727":{"dur":4,"text":"to Dr. Kelsey Pieper, who's a\nmember of the Flint water study"},"732":{"dur":0,"text":"team."},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"And she's going to present the\nresults of our lead analysis,"},"735":{"dur":4,"text":"again, that the

KELSEY PIEPER: Thanks, Marc."},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"So as Mark said, we're\ngoing to be comparing"},"754":{"dur":4,"text":"March 2016 to August 2015\nin terms of water quality"},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"to look at improvements\nafter the switch"},"761":{"dur":3,"text":"and look at the benefit\nof the corrosion control."},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"So in both years, we used\nthe same sampling protocol."},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"This was, as Mark mentioned,\na collaborative effort"},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"with the residents of Flint."},"770":{"dur":2,"text":"We sent them sampling\nkits with instructions."},"773":{"dur":1,"text":"They distributed it."},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"And we instructed the homeowners\nto collect water samples"},"778":{"dur":1,"text":"from a drinking water outlet."},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"So this was a bathroom\nor a kitchen tap."},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"We asked the homeowners\nto let the water sit"},"784":{"dur":2,"text":"for a minimum of\nsix hours, and then"},"787":{"dur":3,"text":"to collect the first draw of\nwater in a one liter sample."},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"The homeowners were\nthen instructed"},"792":{"dur":3,"text":"to

instructed"},"800":{"dur":3,"text":"to flush for final two minutes,\nand collect an additional 250"},"803":{"dur":1,"text":"millimeters of water,\nwhich we'll refer"},"805":{"dur":4,"text":"to as the three-minute flush."},"809":{"dur":1,"text":"As this was a voluntary\nsampling effort,"},"811":{"dur":2,"text":"it was really up to the\nhomeowners and the residents"},"814":{"dur":1,"text":"in Flint to get these kits out."},"815":{"dur":3,"text":"And we had great participation\nrate in August 2015."},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"We had 90% of kits\ncome back, so we"},"821":{"dur":4,"text":"had 69 sampling kits returned."},"825":{"dur":4,"text":"We then sent 269 sampling\nkits back up in March 2016,"},"830":{"dur":3,"text":"and we had 70%\ncome back with 187."},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"Today what we're looking at\nis a before and after picture."},"836":{"dur":3,"text":"So we're going to focus\non the 174 homeowners that"},"840":{"dur":6,"text":"participated in\nboth 2015 and 2016."},"846":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is the data\nthat we've generated"},"848":{"dur":3,"text":"as a comparison between\nAugust 2015 and March 2016."},"852":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'm going to\nwalk you through some"},"853":{"dur":3,"text":"of our main conclusions\nthat we've seen so far."},"856":{"dur":4,"text":"The first one is looking at our\ncompliance of the lead action"},"861":{"dur":0,"text":"level."},"862":{"dur":3,"text":"In August 2015,\n19% of the samples"},"865":{"dur":3,"text":"of the homes that we received\nexceeded the EPA action level"},"868":{"dur":1,"text":"of 15 micrograms per liter."},"870":{"dur":5,"text":"In March 2016, that\nnumber was reduced to 15%."},"876":{"dur":4,"text":"We see this is consistent\nwith our 90th percentile,"},"880":{"dur":3,"text":"as 10% of our\nhomeowners are still"},"883":{"dur":4,"text":"exceeding 29 micrograms\nper liter in their water."},"887":{"dur":2,"text":"This has been\nreduced again in 2016"},"890":{"dur":1,"text":"to 23 micrograms per liter."},"892":{"dur":1,"text":"Now what's really\nimportant is when"},"893":{"dur":2,"text":"we talk about the lead in\ncopper rule, no more than 10%"},"896":{"dur":2,"text":"of systems can exceed\n15 micrograms per liter."},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're still thinking\nthat this water is not"},"901":{"dur":3,"text":"meeting federal requirements."},"905":{"dur":1,"text":"Looking at our\nthree-minute flush,"},"906":{"dur":2,"text":"we're seeing great improvements."},"908":{"dur":4,"text":"In August 2015,\nour 90th percentile"},"913":{"dur":2,"text":"was 7.6 micrograms per liter."},"915":{"dur":3,"text":"And that was halved to\n3.4 micrograms per liter"},"919":{"dur":2,"text":"in March 2016."},"921":{"dur":2,"text":"In keeping, as we continue to\nreduce these concentrations,"},"924":{"dur":2,"text":"we're seeing more homes\nwith non-detectable levels"},"927":{"dur":1,"text":"of lead in their water."},"928":{"dur":4,"text":"So looking at the first\ndraw in 2015, 10% of samples"},"933":{"dur":1,"text":"came back with\nnon-detectable lead."},"935":{"dur":4,"text":"That increased to\n38 percent in 2016."},"939":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is consistent across\nall three samples we took."},"942":{"dur":1,"text":"So really what\nwe're getting at is"},"944":{"dur":3,"text":"we're seeing water quality is\nimproving in terms of lead."},"947":{"dur":2,"text":"However there are\nstill some problems."},"950":{"dur":3,"text":"In 2016 in March, we\ndid find several homes"},"954":{"dur":2,"text":"that had extremely\nhigh levels of lead."},"957":{"dur":3,"text":"Our maximum concentration\nwent from 158"},"960":{"dur":3,"text":"to more than 2,000\nmicrograms per liter in 2016."},"964":{"dur":3,"text":"This in turn increased our\naverage lead concentration"},"968":{"dur":1,"text":"for our sampling effort."},"972":{"dur":2,"text":"So this next graph is\nreporting the same information,"},"974":{"dur":1,"text":"but we thought it was\nreally important to talk"},"976":{"dur":2,"text":"about how lead changed\nat the household level."},"979":{"dur":2,"text":"So on the x-axes are the\nfirst draw concentrations"},"982":{"dur":2,"text":"we collected in August 2015."},"985":{"dur":3,"text":"And then on the y-axes are the\ncorresponding first samples"},"988":{"dur":3,"text":"we collected in March 2016."},"991":{"dur":2,"text":"You'll see there's a\nsolid diagonal line."},"994":{"dur":2,"text":"That is a one-to-one\nline, and data"},"996":{"dur":1,"text":"points to end up\non that line means"},"998":{"dur":3,"text":"that the concentrations in\n'15 and '16 were the same."},"1001":{"dur":1,"text":"Any points below\nthat means they had"},"1003":{"dur":5,"text":"higher lead levels in August\n2015 compared to March 2016."},"1008":{"dur":3,"text":"Anything above, we had higher\nconcentrations in March 2016"},"1011":{"dur":3,"text":"than we did in August 2015."},"1015":{"dur":6,"text":"We found that 71% of the homes\nhad lead below the EPA action"},"1021":{"dur":3,"text":"level during both\nsampling campaigns."},"1025":{"dur":3,"text":"5% of homes had lead\nabove the EPA action level"},"1028":{"dur":3,"text":"during both sampling campaigns."},"1031":{"dur":6,"text":"14% of our homeowners had\nhigh levels only in 2015."},"1037":{"dur":4,"text":"And what was concerning\nis that 10% of homes"},"1042":{"dur":5,"text":"had lead levels above the EPA\naction level only in 2016."},"1047":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is really\nhinting at the fact"},"1049":{"dur":3,"text":"that there's a lot of\nvariability with the water."},"1052":{"dur":1,"text":"And so we wanted to look\nat the relationship."},"1054":{"dur":4,"text":"So we ran a linear\ncorrelation to understand"},"1059":{"dur":4,"text":"how predictive sampling is\nbetween years-- so can we"},"1063":{"dur":3,"text":"identify a home with\nhigh lead in August 2015,"},"1067":{"dur":2,"text":"would that be predictive of\nfinding a home that exceeds"},"1069":{"dur":3,"text":"EPA action

have an r square\nof around one."},"1080":{"dur":2,"text":"This means that\nit is predictive."},"1082":{"dur":1,"text":"There's a strong\nrelationship between them."},"1084":{"dur":1,"text":"And an r squared of\nzero means there is not."},"1086":{"dur":2,"text":"It's more random, it's more\nsporadic-- highly variable."},"1088":{"dur":1,"text":"As you can see, our\nr square is lower."},"1090":{"dur":1,"text":"It's more towards zero."},"1092":{"dur":2,"text":"This means our\ndata-- there is not"},"1094":{"dur":1,"text":"a good, strong relationship."},"1095":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's not predictive."},"1097":{"dur":2,"text":"To emphasize this, there are\ntwo points I want to show."},"1099":{"dur":3,"text":"The first one is that\nin 2015 this home"},"1103":{"dur":3,"text":"was above the EPA action level,\nwith 17 micrograms per liter."},"1106":{"dur":2,"text":"But then during\nour March effort,"},"1109":{"dur":3,"text":"we found this home went up\nto more than 2,000 micrograms"},"1112":{"dur":1,"text":"per liter."},"1113":{"dur":2,"text":"The opposite case happened\nfor this homeowner."},"1116":{"dur":3,"text":"In 2015 they had over\n100 micrograms per liter."},"1119":{"dur":2,"text":"But then in 2016, it reduced\nbelow the EPA action level"},"1122":{"dur":2,"text":"to 8 micrograms per liter."},"1124":{"dur":1,"text":"So really what we're\ntrying to get at"},"1126":{"dur":3,"text":"is, the lead is not\nstrongly correlated."},"1130":{"dur":1,"text":"There's not a good,\nstrong relationship."},"1131":{"dur":2,"text":"So we are recommending\nthat homeowners continue"},"1133":{"dur":3,"text":"using lead filters,\nbecause having lead"},"1137":{"dur":1,"text":"below the EPA action\nlevel in one year"},"1139":{"dur":2,"text":"does not necessarily\nguarantee you're going to have"},"1141":{"dur":3,"text":"low lead in the following year."},"1145":{"dur":2,"text":"So the other concern we\nfound along with lead"},"1147":{"dur":1,"text":"was looking at iron."},"1148":{"dur":2,"text":"Homeowners are concerned because\nof rusty water, red water"},"1151":{"dur":0,"text":"complaints."},"1152":{"dur":1,"text":"And in keeping with\nwhat we saw with lead,"},"1153":{"dur":2,"text":"water conditions are improving."},"1155":{"dur":3,"text":"We're seeing reduced iron\nin water concentration,"},"1159":{"dur":1,"text":"shown by the mean."},"1160":{"dur":4,"text":"Looking at the secondary maximum\ncontaminant level established"},"1165":{"dur":4,"text":"by the EPA, we see\nin 2015, 7% of homes"},"1169":{"dur":2,"text":"were above that secondary level."},"1172":{"dur":2,"text":"And then in '16\nit dropped to 4%."},"1174":{"dur":1,"text":"So we're seeing a\nreduction in iron,"},"1176":{"dur":2,"text":"we're seeing a reduction\nin red water complaints."},"1178":{"dur":1,"text":"However as with\nlead, we are still"},"1180":{"dur":2,"text":"seeing very high levels\nof iron in some homes."},"1186":{"dur":5,"text":"As Marc mentioned, in late\n2015, Flint Water and Detroit"},"1192":{"dur":2,"text":"started adding corrosion\ninhibitors, orthophosphates."},"1194":{"dur":4,"text":"So we were interested in looking\nat how the phosphate levels"},"1199":{"dur":1,"text":"were with lead levels."},"1201":{"dur":3,"text":"So looking at this graph,\nthese are the 174 homes."},"1204":{"dur":3,"text":"You can see phosphate on x-axes\nand first draw lead on the y."},"1208":{"dur":2,"text":"And there is a dark\nsolid line, that"},"1210":{"dur":2,"text":"is the target dose that\nthe Flint water treatment"},"1213":{"dur":2,"text":"plant is trying to achieve."},"1215":{"dur":2,"text":"And what we can see\nis homes, our data"},"1218":{"dur":1,"text":"points to the\nright of that line,"},"1219":{"dur":1,"text":"actually had more\nphosphate in their water"},"1221":{"dur":2,"text":"than that is being added\nby the treatment plant."},"1223":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is indicating to us\nthat lead-bearing

us that there"},"1239":{"dur":2,"text":"are inadequate\nlevels of corrosion"},"1242":{"dur":2,"text":"control in our system,\nwhich we are thinking"},"1244":{"dur":2,"text":"has to do with the age\nof

water age\nand the limited water use."},"1282":{"dur":2,"text":"So with that I'm going to\ngive it back off to Marc"},"1285":{"dur":1,"text":"to talk about water use."},"1289":{"dur":2,"text":"DR.

would"},"1298":{"dur":2,"text":"have dropped more as well."},"1300":{"dur":2,"text":"And one of the\nthings we looked at"},"1302":{"dur":2,"text":"were two homes, at\nthis point-- this"},"1305":{"dur":3,"text":"is a preliminary analysis--\nthat had very persistently"},"1308":{"dur":1,"text":"high lead."},"1310":{"dur":2,"text":"And we went and looked\nat the water

20 to\n45% of the typical water"},"1345":{"dur":3,"text":"use around the United\nStates, is that there"},"1348":{"dur":2,"text":"is concern about the cost\nof their water

if they use less water,\nthey will have less corrosion"},"2465":{"dur":1,"text":"problems in their house."},"2467":{"dur":2,"text":"There are actually\nmany people

standards?"},"2721":{"dur":2,"text":"It was about a year\nand a half, and that"},"2723":{"dur":3,"text":"was with orthophosphate\nand normal water"},"2727":{"dur":2,"text":"use in Washington

those are the two\ntime frames that we"},"2747":{"dur":2,"text":"have where there's been\nparticulate lead in water"},"2750":{"dur":3,"text":"problems similar to\nwhat Flint experienced,"},"2754":{"dur":2,"text":"this eight months to\none and a half years."},"2756":{"dur":2,"text":"But again that was\nwith normal water use."},"2759":{"dur":2,"text":"In some of

year and\na half, two years,"},"2823":{"dur":2,"text":"of concerted\neffort, cooperation."},"2825":{"dur":3,"text":"We're going to need some\nfunding too, to fix these
