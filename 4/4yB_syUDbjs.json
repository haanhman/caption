diagnosed"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"with conduct problems also\nhave this presentation"},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"of high callous-unemotional\ntraits."},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"And what sets them apart\nfrom other children"},"629":{"dur":5,"text":"with conduct problems is that\nthey often engage in proactive"},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"or planned acts of aggression."},"636":{"dur":4,"text":"So while the aggression\nin other children"},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"with conduct problems is\ntypically quite impulsive"},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"and in reaction to something\nexternal that happened,"},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"for instance, a perceived\nthreat or slight to the child,"},"650":{"dur":1,"text":"these children can\nengage in aggression"},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"if they think it's going to\nget them something they want."},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"It might get them\nstatus among peers."},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"It might get them some\ngoods that they

often have low levels"},"667":{"dur":0,"text":"of anxiety."},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is in contrast with\nthe remainder of children"},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"with conduct problems\nwho have low levels"},"674":{"dur":3,"text":"of callous-unemotional\ntraits and who often aggress"},"677":{"dur":1,"text":"when they feel under threat"},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"and whose aggression\nis often impulsive."},"681":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not premeditated."},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"And when these children\nhave had a chance to reflect"},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"on what they have done,\nthey actually often feel bad"},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"and guilty about\nhaving hurt other people"},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"or having done something\nthat has caused their parents"},"695":{"dur":1,"text":"or their teachers to feel sad."},"697":{"dur":3,"text":"And this presentation\ncan also occur"},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"with high levels of anxiety."},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"So you already are beginning to\nsee from this behavioral data"},"707":{"dur":3,"text":"that the reactivity,\nemotional reactivity profile"},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"of these two types of children"},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"with conduct problems\nis quite different."},"714":{"dur":3,"text":"You have a group that seems\nto be more cold and calculated"},"718":{"dur":3,"text":"and unemphatic, and then you\nhave another group who seems"},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"to be more hot headed,\nreactive, and impulsive"},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"but who also has the capacity\nto empathize with other people."},"729":{"dur":4,"text":"So these different behavioral\nprofiles have got psychologists"},"734":{"dur":4,"text":"interested in how these\nchildren may see the world"},"738":{"dur":2,"text":"around them differently from\ntypically developing children"},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"but also their peers\nwith conduct problems."},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"And we can focus on the study\nof the psychological level"},"747":{"dur":4,"text":"of analysis by giving\nchildren experimental tasks"},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"which we often present on\na computer, for instance,"},"755":{"dur":2,"text":"and these tasks can\ngive us an idea"},"757":{"dur":3,"text":"of how they process\ninformation such as facial,"},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"emotional expressions."},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"So I want you to have a go\nat doing one of the tasks"},"766":{"dur":1,"text":"that we do with the children."},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"Here's a face that is starting"},"769":{"dur":3,"text":"with a neutral rather calm\nexpression and I'm going"},"772":{"dur":1,"text":"to press a button and it's going"},"774":{"dur":3,"text":"to start slowly developing\nan emotional expression."},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"And when you think you know\nwhat the expression is,"},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"please shout it out\nloud and don't be shy."},"784":{"dur":5,"text":"Okay. Happy."},"790":{"dur":0,"text":"Very good."},"791":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can see fairly\nearly on in the development"},"793":{"dur":3,"text":"of this expression that this is\nsomebody who's looking happy,"},"796":{"dur":1,"text":"their corners of\nthe mouth are going"},"798":{"dur":1,"text":"up which you can see\na display of teeth."},"800":{"dur":1,"text":"This is a happy looking chap."},"802":{"dur":3,"text":"And here's the same chap\nputting a different expression."},"805":{"dur":4,"text":"And again shout out when you\nthink you know what emotion this"},"810":{"dur":1,"text":"person is displaying."},"812":{"dur":4,"text":"Scared. So I'm hearing\npeople say scared"},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"so this is somebody\nwho is fearful."},"820":{"dur":6,"text":"And you can see that\nthis person is scared"},"826":{"dur":2,"text":"because they are showing\na lot of eye white."},"829":{"dur":3,"text":"This is one of the very,\nvery ecologically valid signs"},"833":{"dur":1,"text":"that somebody's scared"},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"when their eyes are\nlooking a little bit large"},"837":{"dur":2,"text":"and you can see a lot\nof the eye whites."},"840":{"dur":3,"text":"Now children who have conduct\nproblems and high levels"},"843":{"dur":4,"text":"of callous-unemotional traits\nhave difficulty in recognizing"},"848":{"dur":3,"text":"and reacting to other people's\nemotions particularly

right-hand side."},"860":{"dur":4,"text":"And people have used\nfacial stimulus --"},"864":{"dur":2,"text":"that's what I just showed\nto you to assess this."},"867":{"dur":3,"text":"But people have also used\nstimuli that is auditory"},"870":{"dur":4,"text":"so people doing vocalizations\nthat emotional or body postures."},"876":{"dur":3,"text":"And this work by\nour lab and labs"},"879":{"dur":2,"text":"of our colleagues have\nvery conclusively shown"},"882":{"dur":3,"text":"that these children\nreally do not appear"},"885":{"dur":3,"text":"to process other people's\nemotions in a typical fashion."},"888":{"dur":3,"text":"They seem to be underreactive\nto these displays of emotions"},"891":{"dur":2,"text":"and unable to recognize\nthem as effectively"},"894":{"dur":1,"text":"as typically developing\nchildren do."},"896":{"dur":4,"text":"Interestingly they also report\nfeeling less fear themselves."},"901":{"dur":2,"text":"And one of the things that\nwe're interested in researching"},"904":{"dur":3,"text":"in our lab at the moment is\nwhether the reason they have"},"907":{"dur":3,"text":"such difficulty in processing\nother people's emotions stems"},"911":{"dur":3,"text":"from the fact that they don't\nfeel those same emotions very"},"915":{"dur":0,"text":"strongly themselves."},"916":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's probably tricky to\nempathize with other people"},"919":{"dur":1,"text":"and to recognize their emotions"},"921":{"dur":2,"text":"if you have an impoverished\nexperience"},"923":{"dur":1,"text":"of those same emotions yourself."},"926":{"dur":2,"text":"We also know from\nstandard learning paradigms"},"929":{"dur":2,"text":"that these individuals\nwho have conduct problems"},"931":{"dur":3,"text":"and high
