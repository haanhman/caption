200,000."},"108":{"dur":2,"text":"So it was literally gutted."},"110":{"dur":4,"text":"And so we will have a structure\nin place and no services."},"115":{"dur":1,"text":"- But there's a chance\nmaybe

And that's why so many states"},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"have actually closed\ntheir facilities."},"483":{"dur":3,"text":"Because there are almost no need"},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"to have institutions

this."},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"And I would go back to the\nARC lawsuit of the early 1980s"},"516":{"dur":1,"text":"which ended up costing the state"},"518":{"dur":3,"text":"millions upon millions\nupon millions of dollars."},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"The term, are you ready\nfor another ARC lawsuit"},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"has come up in some committees."},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"Are you hearing that too?"},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"- Absolutely I'm hearing that."},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think that there\nare two possible options."},"533":{"dur":3,"text":"One is an ARC lawsuit which\nis a class-action lawsuit"},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"representing the class."},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"Or the second is a formal\ndepartment of justice"},"542":{"dur":4,"text":"Olmstead claim

we would fail\non both the class action"},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"and an Olmstead claim right now."},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"Because we know\nwe have real cases"},"559":{"dur":1,"text":"that are not getting services."},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"- And of course that bleeds over"},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"into the idea of\ntreating addictions"},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"and treating opiod\naddiction things like that."},"569":{"dur":1,"text":"So there's a lot\nof talk about that."},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"- I think the other piece"},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"that has happened in the last\nthree years that's different,"},"575":{"dur":4,"text":"is we have gotten so that\npeople are talking about it."},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"The stigma I think\nis much better."},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"The families are\nsharing their stories."},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think the whole idea"},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"that addiction is\nreally a disease,"},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"it's not a personal choice,"},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that people with\nsignificant depression"},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"are willing to talk about it."},"596":{"dur":3,"text":"I think we've made\nsome headway that way."},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"I think the difficulty\nfor the legislature"},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"is unless you've actually\nhad a family member"},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"or a neighbor you\ndon't understand"},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"how debilitating illness can be."},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"- I need to switch\ngears for just a second"},"612":{"dur":3,"text":"because the hearing\nwas held in the

governance."},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"And that caused a lot of\nconsternation on the floor"},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"and in the committee."},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"I know your caucus was\nnot happy about it."},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"How did you see this\nwhole thing rolling out?"},"631":{"dur":3,"text":"- Well when we heard the\nPERS budget last week,"},"634":{"dur":3,"text":"in that PERS budget were\nsome major policy changes"},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"on restructuring the PERS board."},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"And my concern about that"},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"is first I don't think from\na process point of view"},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"that should be done in\nan apropiations bill."},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"So I didn't feel\ncomfortable with that."},"651":{"dur":4,"text":"And then the second piece\nis the whole restructuring"},"656":{"dur":4,"text":"was very disrespectful\nof the PERS membership."},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"I think it didn't have\nan appropriate hearing."},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"It didn't have due process."},"665":{"dur":3,"text":"There were so many things\nwrong with the idea."},"669":{"dur":1,"text":"And if we had the idea"},"671":{"dur":1,"text":"it should've been a\nfree-standing bill."},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"It should've had a\nclear public hearing."},"674":{"dur":1,"text":"None of which happened."},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm concerned\nabout the process."},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'm concerned\nabout the content."},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"- I know we should tell\nour listeners and viewers"},"684":{"dur":3,"text":"that was it does would\nmake the PERS director"},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"the director of the\nemployee retirement system"},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"a cabinet level agency directly\nappointed by the governor."},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"The governor does not\ndirectly appoint now,"},"694":{"dur":3,"text":"and appoints the chairman\nof the PERS committee."},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"And the PERS committee would\nbecome an advisory committee."},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"And then a legislative committee"},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"called the employ\nbenefits committee"},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"would meet quarterly and\nhave some oversight over it."},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"And it seems to have been\nreally kind of sparked"},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"by the change in\nhealth insurance."},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yes and during the forum"},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"one of my issues is health\ninsurance is a component"},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"of the public employees\nretirement system."},"719":{"dur":3,"text":"But the primary responsibility\nis really to manage"},"723":{"dur":3,"text":"the retirement benefits\nfor public employees,"},"726":{"dur":1,"text":"both state employees"},"727":{"dur":3,"text":"and many local political\nsubdivisions employees."},"730":{"dur":4,"text":"And this

that's\nvery dangerous."},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"I think other states\nthat have politicized"},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"their retirement systems\nhave ended up in trouble."},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"This is a very very\ndangerous bill."},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"- And one of the troubles that\nyour clock has talked about"},"753":{"dur":0,"text":"was the fiduciary\nresponsibility."},"754":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Kathy] Yes"},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"- That's very interesting\n'cause I was talking"},"758":{"dur":3,"text":"with people of the\nNorth Dakota united,"},"762":{"dur":1,"text":"said that the real concern is"},"763":{"dur":1,"text":"that the governor\nmay be conflicted."},"764":{"dur":4,"text":"If the governor has direct\ncontrol over who leads PERS"},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"there could be a conflict"},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"in the fiduciary\nresponsibility to it."},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"- And that fiduciary\nresponsibility is\nwhat has gotten other"},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"public employee retirement\nsystems in trouble."},"778":{"dur":3,"text":"Our current system\nhas been very solid."},"781":{"dur":3,"text":"And to tinker with it\nparticularly in the last moment"},"785":{"dur":1,"text":"is really concerning."},"788":{"dur":1,"text":"- I know the senate committee"},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"was actually taken to\na policy committee."},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"And I know that some people\nwere questioning that."},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"But the whole idea of\nmaking the policy change"},"797":{"dur":1,"text":"was taken to a policy\ncommittee in the senate."},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"They've held a hearing,"},"801":{"dur":1,"text":"and there was some\npromised amendments"},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"about fiduciary

toward\nthe end of the days?"},"810":{"dur":1,"text":"- I think this is going to be"},"812":{"dur":3,"text":"one of the major points of\ncontention about the future"},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"of public

ago the last\nbill was the PERS bill."},"844":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yes."},"846":{"dur":2,"text":"- It's the bill that went\ninto the special meeting."},"849":{"dur":0,"text":"- There is one thing,"},"850":{"dur":1,"text":"speaking of that."},"851":{"dur":1,"text":"Because there was\nanother big hearing"},"853":{"dur":1,"text":"going on at the same\ntime as the PERS bill."},"855":{"dur":1,"text":"And that was the DOT budget"},"856":{"dur":3,"text":"which has now become a\nmatter of consternation."},"859":{"dur":3,"text":"Because of the proposal\nto close eight

too."},"874":{"dur":1,"text":"- I think it could be."},"875":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think the interesting\nthing about that"},"877":{"dur":2,"text":"is it's an opportunity for us"},"879":{"dur":2,"text":"to look at our\nrural communities."},"881":{"dur":3,"text":"Because like the main\npeople who do the roads"},"885":{"dur":1,"text":"in Traill County\nlive in
