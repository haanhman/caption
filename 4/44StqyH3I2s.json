And these venues were the"},"42":{"dur":5,"text":"Minneapolis Institute of Art and the Portland Art \nMuseum in Oregon.

Thank you"},"92":{"dur":5,"text":"also again to Megan and to Ginny Soenksen for \nall of their help.

So \nI'm absolutely delighted that you're all able to"},"105":{"dur":5,"text":"give up your Friday evenings to join me here \ntonight. And the aim of this talk is to give you"},"111":{"dur":3,"text":"a little sneak peak behind the scenes of what \nyou're going to see when you go into the"},"114":{"dur":6,"text":"exhibition. But first I'd like to set the exhibition a \nlittle bit in context and answer the questions"},"121":{"dur":6,"text":"of why Italian fashion and why the V&A. So to \nstart with I think we have to back many years"},"128":{"dur":5,"text":"ago to some Stanfill family trips. As you can \nprobably tell from my accent, I am not British"},"134":{"dur":4,"text":"even though I work at a British national \ninstitution. I'm in fact from Alaska."},"138":{"dur":11,"text":"And in order to combat this bad luck [laughter], \nmy father and mother made every effort"},"149":{"dur":6,"text":"to bring us to Europe at every opportunity. So in \nfact I spent quite a few vacations and holidays"},"156":{"dur":5,"text":"on the streets of Rome and Florence and Milan \nnoticing the difference between what people"},"161":{"dur":6,"text":"wore there and on the streets of Anchorage. \n[Laughter] And so the seed was planted."},"168":{"dur":9,"text":"Helped of course by visits to Italian art \nmuseums which led to a BA in Art History."},"177":{"dur":5,"text":"And also a Master's degree in the History of \nFashion. And ever since I received those,"},"182":{"dur":4,"text":"that degree in History of Fashion, I have been \nasking myself the question, \"Why hasn't there"},"186":{"dur":7,"text":"been a major exhibition looking at Italian style?\" \nAnd in fact, there is this surprising feature of"},"194":{"dur":5,"text":"the Italian cultural landscape that there is no \nnational collection of fashion in Italy."},"199":{"dur":7,"text":"Nor is there a collection of design in a national \nItalian museum. So this gave the V&A a unique"},"206":{"dur":7,"text":"opportunity to propose and deliver an exhibition \ndevoted to Italian style. The image that you see"},"214":{"dur":7,"text":"on the screen for me sums up very nicely the \nsense of joie de vivre and this kind of careless,"},"222":{"dur":3,"text":"easy elegance that enfuses so many of the \ndesigns that you're going to see"},"225":{"dur":6,"text":"within the exhibition. It's in fact a photograph \nfrom 1985 of an advertisement for the Italian"},"232":{"dur":4,"text":"designer Gianfranco Ferre, whose work you'll \nalso see in the show. And I'd like for you to keep"},"237":{"dur":5,"text":"this image in mind as we look at some of the \nfurther examples within the show."},"242":{"dur":9,"text":"But as the title suggests, we start at the end of \nthe second World War. And as this image will"},"251":{"dur":5,"text":"convey, Italy, like much of the rest of Europe, \nwas both physically and economically"},"257":{"dur":5,"text":"devastated at the War's end. It's hard to imagine \nlooking at that photograph that in just a few"},"262":{"dur":4,"text":"year's time, Italy will become one of the leading \nsources of fashion design in the world."},"267":{"dur":6,"text":"During the War, the Italian government actually \ntried to regulate fashion production."},"274":{"dur":5,"text":"It was necessary of course to limit the use of \nfabrics and materials for the war effort."},"280":{"dur":6,"text":"But they also tried to control what they called a \nsense of \"Italian-ness\" in design. I'm not quite"},"286":{"dur":6,"text":"sure what that meant, but I think Mussolini had \nan idea. And one of the elements that he"},"292":{"dur":4,"text":"instituted in this program was something called \n\"il marchio di garanzia,\" the mark of gaurantee,"},"297":{"dur":8,"text":"which was a kind of award given to producers of \ngarments when they had met his restrictions."},"306":{"dur":7,"text":"And that, you can see a photograph, just to the \nright of one of those marks. And it's a little label"},"313":{"dur":6,"text":"that producers could sew into their garments. \nThere is in fact one of these marks inside a"},"320":{"dur":5,"text":"dress on display as you first enter the galleries. \nIt's a very rare surviving example."},"325":{"dur":5,"text":"Because not surprisingly the Italians weren't \nparticularly organized in implementing this"},"330":{"dur":7,"text":"program. And so very few marks of guarantee \nsurvive. But we move very quickly on from the"},"338":{"dur":6,"text":"war's end to a different moment. A moment when \nglamour exploded on to the international scene."},"344":{"dur":7,"text":"Gowns created by Italian designers. And this is \na part of the story that I as an American find very"},"352":{"dur":5,"text":"interesting, because the North American market \nwas crucial for the development of an Italian"},"357":{"dur":5,"text":"fashion industry. And in fact the American \ngovernment, through the Marshall Plan, ensured"},"363":{"dur":5,"text":"that Italian textile factories were heavily \nsubsidized so that they could grow and expand"},"368":{"dur":7,"text":"after the war. The United States needed Italy as \na viable trading partner and they also needed to"},"375":{"dur":8,"text":"help Italy rehabilitate its reputation after so \nmany years of Fascist rule. And after many"},"384":{"dur":6,"text":"weeks of research within several archives in \nItaly, I found documents from the U.S."},"390":{"dur":5,"text":"government that talked directly about promoting \nthis nascent fashion industry in Italy."},"395":{"dur":6,"text":"Some of the things I wanted to point out were \nthat in fact the first fashion shows that were"},"402":{"dur":5,"text":"internationally attended in Italy took place in \nFlorence. We often think of Milan now as the"},"408":{"dur":8,"text":"fashion capital, but in 1951, one gentleman, Mr. \nGiovanni Battista Giorgini, held the first fashion"},"417":{"dur":6,"text":"show in Italy to which international buyers and \npress came. The first fashion show was in his"},"423":{"dur":5,"text":"living room. Attended by only a dozen people but \nthey were deeply influential and included"},"429":{"dur":5,"text":"a member of the press corp of Women's Wear \nDaily, as well as buyers from Bergdorf Goodman"},"434":{"dur":8,"text":"and B. Altman, among others. The next event of \nnote after the one in Giorgini's house took place"},"442":{"dur":5,"text":"in a much larger room. And you'll see a \nphotograph of this here, this is the so called"},"447":{"dur":5,"text":"Sala Bianca in Palazzo Pitti in Florence just \nsouth of the Arno. And he secured the use of"},"453":{"dur":4,"text":"this glamorous hall through his many \nconnections. Before the war he had been a"},"458":{"dur":6,"text":"buying agent for U.S. department stores and he \nhelped them to import Italian handicrafts."},"464":{"dur":5,"text":"After the war he used all of these connections to \nconvince these same people to come"},"469":{"dur":6,"text":"to Florence and see these fashion shows. The \nSala Bianca or White Hall in Palazzo Pitti"},"476":{"dur":4,"text":"as you can see from the image is a very \nglamorous room, it's chandelier-bedecked."},"480":{"dur":5,"text":"Those are murano glass chandeliers. It's a very \nvery grand space and beautiful back drop"},"485":{"dur":6,"text":"against which to show these glamorous gowns. \nAnd so very quickly the guest list grew, from just"},"492":{"dur":7,"text":"a few, a handful really, to several hundred, to by \n1955 over 500 guests came to attend"},"500":{"dur":6,"text":"the shows. The thing too that he was able to \nachieve, not only securing the use of this grand"},"506":{"dur":6,"text":"hall and convincing buyers and press to come, \nwas that he convinced the Italian designers"},"513":{"dur":5,"text":"from all across Italy to come to one place and \nshow. Because of course there were designers"},"518":{"dur":6,"text":"not just in Florence but also in Milan and Rome \nand he was able to get them to look past their"},"524":{"dur":7,"text":"regional differences and come to one place to \nshow. And this makes me remember the sense"},"532":{"dur":7,"text":"of regional suspicion the Italians have, of a \nconversation I had in a taxi cab in Rome"},"539":{"dur":5,"text":"where the taxi cab driver was talking about his \nsuspicion of the people from Naples"},"545":{"dur":4,"text":"and he said, \"After I shake the hand of someone \nfrom Naples I count how many fingers I have.\""},"549":{"dur":7,"text":"[Laughter] So this is no mean feat on the part of \nGiorgini that he brought everyone to one place."},"557":{"dur":5,"text":"And here you see a photograph of the great man \nhimself on the far left and some of the models"},"562":{"dur":7,"text":"showcasing designs. But really the thing to \nremember too is that these designs for the most"},"569":{"dur":5,"text":"part, they were cocktail dresses and evening \ngowns, but the Italians set themselves apart"},"574":{"dur":5,"text":"by showing sportswear. A designer like Pucci for \nexample would have shown skiwear and"},"579":{"dur":5,"text":"beachwear, amongst some of the gowns by the \nother designers. So they were offering a whole"},"585":{"dur":5,"text":"wardrobe that the American market accepted \nreadily."},"590":{"dur":5,"text":"I did a lot of the research for this portion of the \nexhibition in this very unassuming looking"},"596":{"dur":5,"text":"building. It's the state archives in Florence, \nwhere the Giorgini papers are held, and it's a"},"601":{"dur":5,"text":"fascinating process to gain access to a building \nlike this, because it involves not just a lot of"},"607":{"dur":6,"text":"paperwork but a lot of coffee drinking with people \nto make sure they think you're okay. [Laughter]"},"614":{"dur":8,"text":"And there I discovered documents like this, \nwhich is one of the guest lists for the 1955 event"},"623":{"dur":5,"text":"and I don't know if those of you in the back can \nsee but what was so exciting for me was to read"},"628":{"dur":4,"text":"some of the names on this list, which include \nthe great department stores across"},"632":{"dur":6,"text":"the United States. B. Altman, Filene's, Macy's, \nI.Magnin in San Francisco, and many others,"},"639":{"dur":5,"text":"as well as the stores across Europe. So what \nwe have here is really a who's who's list"},"645":{"dur":6,"text":"of the filters of taste for the North American \nmarket. Because these buyers, now long"},"651":{"dur":6,"text":"forgotten, were really the conduits through which \nthe choice and style of North American women"},"658":{"dur":8,"text":"were created. Just to give you a bit of additional \ncontext, in this slide you'll see photographs"},"666":{"dur":6,"text":"of that very first show in 1951 in Giorgini's living \nroom. And you can see that the models are just"},"673":{"dur":6,"text":"kind of walking around. A group of women \nseated in chairs. But the photograph on the right"},"679":{"dur":5,"text":"shows Giorgini's daughter Matilda with one of \nthe buyers from Morgan's department store"},"685":{"dur":7,"text":"in Montreal, Henry Nixon. Henry is seated with \nMatilda with a way that suggests that perhaps"},"692":{"dur":7,"text":"their alliance is more than just professional. \n[Laughter] And after conversations with"},"699":{"dur":7,"text":"the grandson, I can confirm that they had a \ndalliance. But then also one of the programs"},"707":{"dur":6,"text":"is shown below. And the thing that Giorgini did \nso creatively was that he ensured that his"},"713":{"dur":5,"text":"guests had a fabulous time. There were \nsuppers, there were dances, there were all kinds"},"719":{"dur":6,"text":"of entertainment. So they were really the kind of \nprototype of what we think of as a fashion week."},"726":{"dur":7,"text":"Catwalk shows interspersed with all sorts of \nother attractions. I mentioned sportswear earlier"},"733":{"dur":5,"text":"and here you see a sampling of a Pucci blouse \non the catwalk and in our conservation studio"},"739":{"dur":5,"text":"the same blouse before it went on display. And \nthere is John Nixon again with his little bowtie"},"745":{"dur":4,"text":"at the background, seated next to Julia Trissel, \nthe buyer for Bergdorf Goodman."},"749":{"dur":6,"text":"And you can see that these are designs that \nweren't really always about the hightlest level of"},"756":{"dur":6,"text":"couture. There was a sportswear option \navailable. We then move on to a part of"},"762":{"dur":5,"text":"the exhibition that talks about a different type of \nclothing. This is clothing made for one woman"},"768":{"dur":8,"text":"by a dressmaker. A dressmaker in Italy is called \na sartoria. A sartoria has a kind of lower level"},"776":{"dur":4,"text":"if you like of a reputation. She probably doesn't \nhave a designer label in her garments."},"781":{"dur":6,"text":"She has a small atelier of seamstresses and \nshe's servicing a very local clientele"},"787":{"dur":5,"text":"who develop a relationship with her over the \nyears and who trust her to create wardrobes"},"792":{"dur":7,"text":"that are both stylish but also adapted to the \nclient's figure and taste. In this case, the client"},"800":{"dur":5,"text":"is Mrs. Werner Abegg. There's a photo of her on \nthe left. By all reports she was a woman of good"},"805":{"dur":6,"text":"humor and she also had very specific ideas \nabout how she wanted to dress."},"812":{"dur":7,"text":"She was married to the textile and art collector \nWerner Abegg who also had a cotton finishing"},"819":{"dur":6,"text":"plant in Turin where they lived. Mrs. Abegg could \nhave afforded the best of French couture."},"825":{"dur":6,"text":"But she chose to buy local and she went to the \ndressmaker Maria Grimaldi to have her suits and"},"832":{"dur":9,"text":"evening gowns made. And here is a detail of one \nof those pieces. It's a day coat and you can"},"841":{"dur":4,"text":"perhaps just make out the very meticulous \nseaming on the back of the coat."},"846":{"dur":5,"text":"And in the gallery we've been able to open up \none of her suit jackets and lay it flat so that you"},"852":{"dur":8,"text":"can see the lining is as impeccably tailored at \nthe exterior. Maria Grimaldi did not have a"},"860":{"dur":5,"text":"designer label but she did have a maker's mark. \nIt's a kind of spray of flowers that she stitched"},"865":{"dur":6,"text":"into the waistbands of some of her clothes. And \nit was a very modest affair. But we also have"},"872":{"dur":6,"text":"in addition to Maria Grimaldi's designs for Mrs. \nAbegg, a group of accessories that fill out the"},"879":{"dur":9,"text":"wardrobe. We then move on to a very different \nsubject entirely. Looking back at that group of"},"889":{"dur":5,"text":"modest garments made by a dressmaker, it \ndoes give you a sense of the quality of the hand-"},"894":{"dur":6,"text":"made available across the country at the war's \nend and into the 1950s. But there was another"},"900":{"dur":5,"text":"phenomenon abrewing and that is the so-called \nHollywood on the Tiber moment when so many"},"906":{"dur":6,"text":"Hollywood films were shot on location in Rome \nin their Cinecitta Studios. The Italian government"},"913":{"dur":6,"text":"actively encouraged the Hollywood producers to \nfilm there through subsidies and tax breaks."},"919":{"dur":5,"text":"And so this helped to bring more and more \nproductions to that city. Within the galleries"},"925":{"dur":5,"text":"you'll see some wonderful film clips from Roman \nHoliday and also War and Peace"},"931":{"dur":6,"text":"and La Dolce Vita. These images created a \nglamorous back drop against which Italian"},"938":{"dur":6,"text":"style developed. As well as the phenomenon of \nso many Hollywood celebrities descending on"},"944":{"dur":5,"text":"Rome and going shopping. So here you see a \nphotograph of Audrey Hepburn shopping with"},"950":{"dur":6,"text":"Salvatore Ferragamo choosing her shoes. Many \nother celebrities of course came to Florence"},"956":{"dur":5,"text":"but also their holidays on the Amalfi Coast, their \nlove affairs on and off set. This became the"},"961":{"dur":9,"text":"gossip column's favorite target. But the result \nwas that so many images of Italian designers"},"970":{"dur":5,"text":"being worn by these Hollywood stars were \nspread around the world and it made a name for"},"976":{"dur":6,"text":"Italian style. Ava Gardner was one of the best \nclients for the so-called Sorelle Fontana, or"},"982":{"dur":5,"text":"Fontana Sisters, whose atelier was just behind \nthe Spanish Steps in Rome, a very convenient"},"988":{"dur":6,"text":"stopping point for going shopping. This gown \nworn by Audrey Hepburn in the film"},"994":{"dur":5,"text":"War and Peace is in the exhibition and it was \ndesigned by the Roman couturier Gattinoni"},"999":{"dur":6,"text":"which is still in business today. And this is one \nof my favorite pieces in the exhibition, so I'll urge"},"1005":{"dur":4,"text":"you when you go into the galleries to stop and \npay homage. It is a gown that was designed by"},"1010":{"dur":5,"text":"the Milanese couterier Mila Schon, and despite \nher name, she was Italian, based in Milan."},"1016":{"dur":8,"text":"And she showed on the Sala Bianca catwalk for \nthe first time in 1965 and by 1966 she was the"},"1024":{"dur":5,"text":"go-to designer for some of the best dressed \nwomen in the world. This gown was worn by"},"1029":{"dur":4,"text":"Princess Lee Radziwill, the sister of Jacqueline \nKennedy, to Truman Capote's Black and White"},"1034":{"dur":6,"text":"Ball in 1966. And there you can see an image of \nher dancing with Truman. She's having"},"1040":{"dur":7,"text":"a marvelous time, I'm not so sure that he is. \n[Laughter] And what is remarkable to me,"},"1047":{"dur":6,"text":"aside from the fact that this gown is just drop \ndead glamorous, is the fact that we are in 1966"},"1054":{"dur":9,"text":"15 years after that first fashion show in Giorgini's \nhouse in Florence and we have a woman who is"},"1064":{"dur":4,"text":"known for her French couture wardrobe, \nchoosing an Italian to dress her for the ball."},"1068":{"dur":7,"text":"So look how far Italian fashion has come since \nthat first sparcely attended show in Florence."},"1076":{"dur":5,"text":"Here's a photo of the couple on the dance floor. \nYou can just see her with her arm bent dancing"},"1082":{"dur":7,"text":"with her husband. And some other examples of \ncontributions by designers at this time, including"},"1089":{"dur":6,"text":"the Palazzo Pyjamas by Galitzine. The First \nLady Jacqueline Kennedy is known to have worn"},"1095":{"dur":5,"text":"a similar ensemble while entertaining in the \nWhite House. And of course the more typical"},"1100":{"dur":6,"text":"designs of Emilio Pucci, whose skiwear and \nbeachwear really suited the American taste"},"1107":{"dur":6,"text":"but who also designed very fantastic sort of \nholiday wardrobes for the jet set."},"1113":{"dur":6,"text":"His kaleidoscopic prints really struck a chord for \nsummer wardrobes. This is our fabulous Vespa"},"1120":{"dur":4,"text":"which is in the exhibition. I couldn't do an \nexhibition on Italian style without a Vespa."},"1124":{"dur":6,"text":"It was required. This is a piece of fantastic \ndesign that we sourced from a collector"},"1131":{"dur":8,"text":"in Britain who received it in bits, a pile of scrap, \nand lovingly restored it over several years."},"1139":{"dur":5,"text":"And it's one of a few surviving examples that \nwere first imported into Britain in 1949."},"1145":{"dur":7,"text":"So it really is a remarkable surviving piece. We \nhave this delightful broach as well."},"1153":{"dur":5,"text":"Our only piece of jewlery in the exhibition, that \nwas given to Elizabeth Taylor by Richard Burton."},"1159":{"dur":6,"text":"And of course their love affair on the set of \nCleopatra in Rome was notorious. But fueled by"},"1165":{"dur":7,"text":"jewlery purchases. In fact Richard Burton said of \nElizabeth that the only word that she knew"},"1173":{"dur":6,"text":"in Italian was Bulgari. [Laughter] And when the \nexhibition came to London our sponsors"},"1179":{"dur":4,"text":"happened to be Bulgari so they were absolutely \ndelighted with that quote so we used it often."},"1184":{"dur":8,"text":"And we're not forgetting the men. We do have a \ngroup of beautifully tailored ensembles and suits"},"1193":{"dur":6,"text":"in this next portion of the gallery, with examples \nfrom design houses specializing both in"},"1199":{"dur":5,"text":"bespoke suits as well as ready to wear \nexamples and it gives a sense of some of the"},"1205":{"dur":7,"text":"hallmarks of Italian menswear, particularly the \nbespoke suit which tends to in the case of this"},"1213":{"dur":6,"text":"firm, Rubinacci, it provides a really interesting \ncounterpoint to the English tailoring tradition,"},"1219":{"dur":4,"text":"which until I started work on this project I was \nmuch more familiar with. The English jacket"},"1223":{"dur":7,"text":"tends to have quite a bit of padding, almost like \narmor. And as one tailor put it, it gently corrects"},"1231":{"dur":8,"text":"the defects of the wearer. [Laughter] The Italians \ntake out that padding and as you probably know"},"1239":{"dur":5,"text":"from thinking about the Armani suit, which \nbecame the kind of uniform of the 90s, the"},"1245":{"dur":4,"text":"Italian suit jacket is often not only without \npadding but in the case of Rubinacci, because"},"1249":{"dur":5,"text":"of the Naples climate where they're based, they \ntake out the lining of the jacket as well to give it"},"1255":{"dur":6,"text":"a more fluid drape. So these are some of the \nexamples of tailoring on show. And then we"},"1262":{"dur":5,"text":"move through this very loose chronology into \nanother portion of the exhibition, which is"},"1267":{"dur":7,"text":"dealing with the subject of Made in Italy. And of \ncourse from the late 70s onward, the Italian"},"1274":{"dur":8,"text":"fashion story moves on from the handmade, the \nbespoke, the couture, and that trace of the hand"},"1283":{"dur":7,"text":"to the factory. And when I say factory, I hope I'm \nnot conjuring up images of mass fashion"},"1291":{"dur":5,"text":"and mass produced clothes because the Italian \nfactory was particularly adept at making clothing"},"1296":{"dur":7,"text":"in multiples to a very high standard. For this \nreason, by the 1980s, even clothes that were"},"1304":{"dur":7,"text":"designed in Paris were probably made in Italy, \nsuch was the skill of the Italian factory."},"1312":{"dur":6,"text":"And some of the designers that you'll see in this \nsection are what you might expect to see"},"1319":{"dur":4,"text":"when you come to an exhibition about Italian \nfashion. Those big names, the Versaces"},"1324":{"dur":6,"text":"and Armanis as well as perhaps some that were \nonce very well known but now slightly forgotten"},"1331":{"dur":6,"text":"like the house of Krizia, as you see here. This is \none of my other favorite pieces in the exhibition."},"1337":{"dur":7,"text":"I am a child of the 1980s and those shoulder \npads speak to me. This is Gianni Versace"},"1344":{"dur":7,"text":"ensemble from 1985 and what's remarkable to \nme is that this is a piece that he gave the V&A"},"1352":{"dur":5,"text":"to represent his own legacy as a designer. He \ndonated it the year after it was made and it"},"1357":{"dur":6,"text":"represents how he saw himself. And it uses \nsome of the finest quality materials available."},"1363":{"dur":6,"text":"Beautiful wools and leather, as well as including \nall the accessories, the hat, the jewlery, and the"},"1370":{"dur":6,"text":"shoes, and some of those pieces we've been \nable to show with the garment. The wool of the"},"1376":{"dur":7,"text":"jacket is made by a textile firm in Prato called  \nFaliero Sarti and I went to that factory, they have"},"1384":{"dur":6,"text":"an archive, and Mr. Sarti remembers Versace \ncoming to the factory himself to choose"},"1391":{"dur":5,"text":"the fabric. He didn't send an assistant, he didn't \nsend his associate, he came on his own."},"1396":{"dur":5,"text":"Spoke to Mr. Sarti and didn't like any of the \nhoundstooth check Mr. Sarti offered."},"1402":{"dur":5,"text":"He wanted something bigger and he wanted it in \nclassic black and white. So those were made for"},"1407":{"dur":6,"text":"Mr. Versace to order. And we've shown the \nswatch from that conversation next to this group"},"1414":{"dur":7,"text":"in the gallery. Speaking of textiles, we also want \nto remember the fact that even though ready to"},"1422":{"dur":5,"text":"wear by the mid 80s had become the new \nfashion language, there were still Italian"},"1427":{"dur":5,"text":"designers like Gianfrano Ferre who were \ncreating beautiful couture pieces, such as this"},"1433":{"dur":6,"text":"evening cape, which if you look it at very closely \nin the gallery, you'll see that the surface"},"1439":{"dur":4,"text":"embroidery comes out in a 3-dimensional, \nalmost sculptural way. It's absolutely a tour de"},"1444":{"dur":8,"text":"force of couture technique. We've also got \nexamples from the very witty Franco Moschino."},"1452":{"dur":8,"text":"This yellow pages jacket is one of my favorites. \nAnd of course other examples from Versace,"},"1460":{"dur":7,"text":"as well as knitwear. Knitwear became one of the \nkey drivers of Italian exports from the 1980s"},"1467":{"dur":5,"text":"onwards. And it includes examples from of \ncourse the house of Missoni and some wittier"},"1473":{"dur":6,"text":"examples from the house of Krizia.
