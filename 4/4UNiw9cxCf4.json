approximately"},"460":{"dur":3,"text":"20.8 million stories of addiction and substance\nmisuse."},"463":{"dur":4,"text":"That's almost 21,000,000 people aged 12 or\nolder who have a substance use

criteria for mental illness, and"},"478":{"dur":7,"text":"8.1 million adults aged 18 or older had both\na substance use disorder and a mental illness."},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"So as with any problem, it has to be measured\nin order to be managed."},"489":{"dur":3,"text":"And when we look a little closer, we peel\nback another layer we see that among those"},"492":{"dur":5,"text":"with a substance us disorder nearly 1 out\nof 3 struggled with illicit drugs, 3 out of"},"497":{"dur":4,"text":"4 struggled with alcohol use and about 1 and\n8 had both an alcohol and an illicit drug"},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"use disorder."},"504":{"dur":8,"text":"And of the 43.4 million Americans with a mental\nillness 1 in 5 had a serious mental illness."},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"These are huge numbers."},"515":{"dur":4,"text":"And because behavioral health is a public\nhealth issue with impact across the lifespan"},"519":{"dur":5,"text":"in almost every aspect of human endeavor,\nthese conditions have a major ripple effect"},"525":{"dur":4,"text":"in the lives of many individuals, families\nand communities."},"530":{"dur":5,"text":"So we see here when we bring the mental illness\nand the substance use disorder together, nearly"},"536":{"dur":6,"text":"55 million Americans, 54.9 million Americans\nor 1 in 5 adults in America, met the criteria"},"542":{"dur":6,"text":"for substance use disorder or mental illness\nin the past year and only 39% of that 55 million"},"549":{"dur":1,"text":"received services."},"550":{"dur":4,"text":"So given what we know about the risks and\nharms of untreated behavioral health conditions"},"554":{"dur":6,"text":"that means 33 million Americans are at higher\nrisk for physical health comorbidities, suicide,"},"561":{"dur":4,"text":"accidents, injuries, and premature deaths."},"565":{"dur":4,"text":"In 2015 33 million people went untreated."},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"That\u2019s 33 million lives hanging in the balance."},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"But the public story does not end there."},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"It doesn\u2019t end with the individuals who\nhave behavioral health conditions it extends"},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"to their families and friends."},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"It affects schools, businesses, and communities."},"583":{"dur":6,"text":"It affects the whole array of health and human\nservices that you see here."},"589":{"dur":3,"text":"And to put these data into a context I\u2019m\ngoing to tell a personal story."},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"It\u2019s a story about baby Asa."},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"Asa is the adopted son of one of my very close\nSAMHSA colleagues."},"599":{"dur":6,"text":"And some of you may have met Asa last Spring\nwhen I spoke about him at the RX Summit."},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"The National RX Drug Abuse and Heroin Summit."},"608":{"dur":5,"text":"Asa\u2019s birth parents, as you can see here,\nwere affected by untreated alcohol and drug"},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"use."},"615":{"dur":4,"text":"They started with underage drinking and in\ntheir community they did not have effective"},"619":{"dur":4,"text":"prevention or early intervention programs\navailable to them and so their underage drinking"},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"evolved into experimentation with prescription\ndrugs."},"627":{"dur":4,"text":"Again, without screening or early intervention\nor treatment that prescription drug misuse"},"631":{"dur":6,"text":"evolved into addiction and then further evolved\ninto heroin use which was cheaper and more"},"638":{"dur":1,"text":"readily available."},"640":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, without the prevention and treatment\nservices that could've helped these problems"},"644":{"dur":5,"text":"from escalating, instead of the ages of 22\nand 19, this young couple had a baby."},"650":{"dur":6,"text":"In a short pregnancy of only 6 months, Asa\u2019s\nbirth mom continued to use heroin with inadequate"},"657":{"dur":9,"text":"access to treatment and both parents had multiple\ninterfaces across criminal justice, emergency"},"666":{"dur":5,"text":"response, fire departments and emergency rooms,\nchild welfare and so on."},"672":{"dur":5,"text":"And none of these systems in this community\nwere able to provide these young people with"},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"the treatment and support that they needed\nto achieve recovery."},"680":{"dur":3,"text":"And as a result we have a very short lived\nlove story."},"684":{"dur":4,"text":"The birth mother and the birth father are\nno longer a couple and their biological son"},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"is no longer their son."},"690":{"dur":7,"text":"There isn\u2019t a happy ending for this story\nof the biological parents whose drug use escalated"},"697":{"dur":5,"text":"while their health status plummeted and none\nof the systems helped them get the help that"},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"they needed."},"703":{"dur":5,"text":"So these are the basis and stories behind\nuntreated behavioral health conditions."},"708":{"dur":5,"text":"The combined cost of these interventions is\nmuch steeper than what could've happened if"},"714":{"dur":5,"text":"we had early intervention and community-based\nservices for the child and the family."},"720":{"dur":4,"text":"And the outcomes were far worse than what\nthey should've been."},"725":{"dur":4,"text":"I wanted to share the story with you even\nbriefly so we can begin to understand the"},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"context of these issues as a nation."},"732":{"dur":3,"text":"That untreated behavioral health problems\ndo not start and stop with the person who"},"735":{"dur":4,"text":"has the illness but reach far and wide and\ninclude their families and communities."},"740":{"dur":6,"text":"Even the smallest and most vulnerable among\nus like baby Asa."},"746":{"dur":5,"text":"As with any untreated condition the longer\nthey go the further away the goals of recovery"},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"seem to be."},"755":{"dur":7,"text":"But it doesn\u2019t have to be a bleak and dreary\nstory there is so much good news to tell."},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"As I mentioned that Asa\u2019s birth parents\ncould've benefited from effective underage"},"765":{"dur":1,"text":"drinking programs."},"767":{"dur":5,"text":"We have the data now to tell us that alcohol\nuse remains a concern among adolescents but"},"772":{"dur":2,"text":"there is very good news."},"775":{"dur":5,"text":"The rate of past month alcohol uses among\nadolescents aged 12 to 17 has fallen significantly"},"780":{"dur":1,"text":"over the past decade."},"781":{"dur":4,"text":"In fact, when we look back at 2002 we see\nunderage alcohol use has been cut nearly in"},"786":{"dur":3,"text":"half going from 17.6 percent to 9.6 percent."},"790":{"dur":6,"text":"That\u2019s a decline from 4.4 million to 2.4\nmillion and now we have about 2 million reasons"},"797":{"dur":4,"text":"to celebrate the science and practice of substance\nabuse prevention."},"801":{"dur":4,"text":"These 2 million lives have been spared from\nthe harms and potential consequences of underage"},"806":{"dur":1,"text":"drinking."},"807":{"dur":4,"text":"Equally impressive is the reduction in the\nrate of past month cigarette use."},"811":{"dur":7,"text":"Among youth aged 12 to 17 which has dropped\nto an all-time low from 13% to 4.2% in 2015."},"819":{"dur":4,"text":"That went from 1 out of 8 young people to\n1 in 20."},"823":{"dur":3,"text":"I think zero is within reach."},"826":{"dur":4,"text":"These drops have coincided with targeted prevention\nefforts across the country focused on underage"},"831":{"dur":7,"text":"drinking and tobacco, and while the purpose\nof the NSDUH is not to identify the causes"},"839":{"dur":4,"text":"of these changes, I think everyone in this\nroom knows what this means."},"843":{"dur":1,"text":"This means that prevention works."},"845":{"dur":4,"text":"So we need to continue our efforts, we need\nto strengthen our prevention programs and"},"849":{"dur":5,"text":"we need to make sure they reach every corner\nof America."},"855":{"dur":4,"text":"We have more good news for adolescents when\nwe look at past marijuana use, although this"},"860":{"dur":3,"text":"is a mixed story."},"863":{"dur":5,"text":"So while marijuana use rates for youth aged\n12 to 17 have remained stable over the past"},"868":{"dur":1,"text":"decade."},"869":{"dur":5,"text":"When we look at rates among young adults aged\n18 through 25 and adults aged 26 and older"},"875":{"dur":5,"text":"we see significant increases and we have to\nwonder if the marijuana use rates tell more"},"880":{"dur":1,"text":"than one story."},"881":{"dur":6,"text":"Over a ten-year period, marijuana use held\nsteady among youth aged 12 to 17, nudged upward"},"887":{"dur":9,"text":"with 1.5 million more users of marijuana among\nyoung adults and a gain of 6 million additional"},"896":{"dur":2,"text":"adult users 26 and older."},"899":{"dur":5,"text":"That is more than a 50 percent increase among\nour adult population in marijuana use."},"904":{"dur":3,"text":"And, what is driving the uptick among adult\nmarijuana users?"},"907":{"dur":4,"text":"I think we all have our own ideas what we\ncan do differently to drive these numbers"},"911":{"dur":1,"text":"down."},"912":{"dur":5,"text":"These are the types of questions that arise\nwhen we begin using data to identify our public"},"918":{"dur":1,"text":"health problems."},"919":{"dur":5,"text":"Then it is incumbent on all of us to turn\nthis insight into action."},"925":{"dur":3,"text":"Marijuana remains the most commonly used illicit\ndrug in the United States."},"928":{"dur":8,"text":"Among the 27.1 million Americans who used\nillicit drugs in the past month, 82 percent"},"936":{"dur":2,"text":"were marijuana users."},"939":{"dur":5,"text":"This is problem that we as a nation must address."},"944":{"dur":3,"text":"Another problem that is top of mind for many\nof us is opioid misuse."},"948":{"dur":5,"text":"It\u2019s a pressing issue with 12.7 million\nmisusers of opioids in 2015."},"954":{"dur":8,"text":"The bulk of this comprised by people who misuse\nprescription pain relievers clearly the dominant"},"962":{"dur":5,"text":"group in this bunch, although you can also\nsee here that we have about 828,000 heroin"},"967":{"dur":6,"text":"users and 299 knowing Fentanyl misusers."},"973":{"dur":5,"text":"This new information, taking a look at opioid\nmisuse and other valuable data are contained"},"979":{"dur":3,"text":"in a new report that we are also releasing\ntoday on prescription drug misuse."},"982":{"dur":4,"text":"So we can look a little more deeply at heroin."},"986":{"dur":7,"text":"In 2015 828,000 people aged 12 or older used\nheroin in the past year, so that\u2019s more"},"993":{"dur":7,"text":"than double the number who

2015 going to"},"1007":{"dur":1,"text":"look like."},"1008":{"dur":6,"text":"And I think we were able to exhale, not a\ncomplete sigh of relief, but getting there."},"1014":{"dur":5,"text":"The difference between 2014 and 2015 is not\nsignificant but it\u2019s going in the right"},"1020":{"dur":1,"text":"direction."},"1021":{"dur":6,"text":"So we've gone from 914,000 heroin users in\n2014 to a reduction to 828,000."},"1027":{"dur":7,"text":"So that is good news but we still need to\npress forward and keep the pedal to the ground"},"1034":{"dur":4,"text":"on our efforts on addressing and

percent in 2015."},"1116":{"dur":7,"text":"So that's an additional 726,000 young adults\nwho experienced an episode of depression."},"1123":{"dur":5,"text":"And for youth, younger children, the
