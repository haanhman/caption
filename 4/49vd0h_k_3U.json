was"},"544":{"dur":2,"text":"at the beginning just a very simple blog"},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"called AddictiveDaughter.com which was,"},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"really the intention was to kind of make"},"551":{"dur":3,"text":"the principles of self-help\nand spirituality accessible"},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"and aspirational to people our age,"},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"cause we'd always seen it

seen"},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"reading self-help books are kind of"},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"middle aged women sobbing\nin the self-help aisle."},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"And we were like actually,\nthe ideas in these books"},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"are really good but we want to package it"},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"and help other people to understand"},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"how you can implement\nthe stuff in your life."},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"And that was what the blog started as."},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"What we were really inspired by"},"581":{"dur":3,"text":"is this idea of the 20's\nare the launching pad"},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"to the rest of your life."},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"So the decisions you make\nduring that time frame"},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"about career, who you choose to

life"},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"but actually we can make\nsome really healthy decisions"},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"which are gonna put us at\nleast on the right track."},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"And so that's kind of where\nit all came from as an idea."},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"- Well initially it literally just started"},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"as a little blog as Joey mentioned."},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"And the very first step was we realized"},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"when we'd gone to these 12 step meetings"},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"we'd seen that the power\nreally lay in people's stories"},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"and in people being\nhonest, because by the time"},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"you get to a 12 step meeting,\nyou've had enough of lying,"},"631":{"dur":3,"text":"and in that space you can\nbe honest with yourself"},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"and with people around you."},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"Generally, that's the kind of idea anyway."},"638":{"dur":4,"text":"So we said well, we need to\nput our own story out there"},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"and be honest because\na lot of people we know"},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"probably think that we're\nreally happy and successful"},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"because that's the mask we're\nputting out in social media"},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"and when we're going out and\npartying with our friends"},"652":{"dur":1,"text":"it's all fun and games, you know."},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"No one's really seeing the truth"},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"that's going on behind closed doors,"},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"which is what I'd experienced\nwith my family growing up."},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"No one would of known there was a problem."},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"So we wrote our personal stories"},"663":{"dur":1,"text":"and as Joey mentioned\nwe're both very different"},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"and we both have different stories."},"667":{"dur":1,"text":"We kind of thought

hovering"},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"over the publish button\nand it was really scary."},"676":{"dur":3,"text":"So this would of been kind\nof the end of Summer 2012."},"679":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah."},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"- And it's really scary because\nit was really vulnerable"},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"to be that honest and that open"},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"and not know who was going to read it."},"686":{"dur":1,"text":"All the actor friends, all the people"},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"we'd worked with over the years."},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"And once we did that, we\nsuddenly got a lot of emails"},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"sent through and private messages saying,"},"695":{"dur":3,"text":"I saw that thing, your\nAddictive Daughter thing"},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"and I'm really inspired\nand that's really helped."},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"This is something I've been\nstruggling with for so long"},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"and I just didn't know who to talk to."},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"So that was the first step wasn't it?"},"705":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah and then we started creating"},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"weekly video content called Life Nuggets"},"709":{"dur":1,"text":"where we just share a\nlife lesson basically."},"711":{"dur":3,"text":"So it may be something that\nwe've been struggling with"},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's actually ongoing."},"716":{"dur":1,"text":"We've been doing that for four years."},"718":{"dur":1,"text":"I think one of the big things"},"719":{"dur":1,"text":"that was a big surprise to us,"},"720":{"dur":2,"text":"the lovely thing was\ngetting contacted personally"},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"from people, by people\nwho were going through"},"724":{"dur":1,"text":"a similar thing and related."},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"I think there's, I mean,\nromance in your 20's"},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"is a complete minefield and\na lot of people do relate"},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"to the

WordPress\nblog, which was good."},"769":{"dur":4,"text":"And it kind of showed us\nthat media were interested"},"773":{"dur":1,"text":"and the people were interested."},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"So we were obviously doing\nsomething that was working"},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"beyond just whatever it\nwas doing for us too."},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"We knew the benefits at\nthat point in our own lives."},"782":{"dur":3,"text":"And then after that I guess,\nfollowing on from that"},"786":{"dur":1,"text":"we undertook--"},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"- We trained in life coaching\nand addiction studies"},"790":{"dur":3,"text":"just to kind of get those\nskills under our belt as well."},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"- And off the back of the life coaching"},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"and addiction
