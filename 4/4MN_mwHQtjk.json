effective"},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"at doing basically everything\nthat horses could do,"},"532":{"dur":1,"text":"then horses had nowhere to turn."},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"They had no other options."},"535":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's why their\nwork has disappeared."},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"Human beings on the other hand\nare of course intelligent."},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"We have the

work"},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"because we will always be able\nto find something new to do."},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think that's obviously\na correct comparison."},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"But here's the thing to\nunderstand, while it's true"},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"that humans are obviously\ndramatically different"},"568":{"dur":3,"text":"from horses, it is also\ntrue that the machines"},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"which will threaten\nthe jobs of people"},"573":{"dur":3,"text":"in the future are dramatically\ndifferent from the machines"},"577":{"dur":1,"text":"that displaced horses."},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"And perhaps the most\nimportant difference,"},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"the things that sets apart\nthe machines we have today is"},"583":{"dur":3,"text":"that those machines\nincreasingly have the ability"},"587":{"dur":1,"text":"to learn and to adapt."},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"And what that means is"},"590":{"dur":3,"text":"that technology today is no\nlonger just displacing people"},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"in particular jobs or in\nparticular industries,"},"596":{"dur":1,"text":"or taking over the\nspecific things."},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"It's really beginning\nto encroach"},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"on the fundamental quality"},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"that really sets us\napart as a species."},"605":{"dur":4,"text":"And on the fundamental quality\nthat so far has allowed people"},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"to stay ahead of the\nmarch of technology."},"612":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think that that's\nsomething to really think about."},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"We may be looking at something"},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"that is really genuinely\ndifferent"},"620":{"dur":4,"text":"and you know this is an idea\nthat I think kind of

different."},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"They're always extremely\nsceptical about that."},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"On the other hand, in\nthe realm of technology,"},"637":{"dur":1,"text":"this time is always different."},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"That's the whole point of\ninnovation we're always trying"},"640":{"dur":3,"text":"to go to someplace that\nwe haven't been before."},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"That's the whole\nnature of progress."},"646":{"dur":1,"text":"And so I think perhaps one"},"647":{"dur":3,"text":"of the fundamental questions\nhere is is this really a subject"},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"that is mostly about economics,\nor is it about technology."},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"And I tend to come down\non the technology side."},"655":{"dur":4,"text":"I think that there is no\nuniversal law of the universe,"},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"or even about economics\nthat says"},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"that people will always\nhave to be part of the loop."},"663":{"dur":1,"text":"There is nothing that says"},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"that human beings must\nalways be essential"},"667":{"dur":1,"text":"to the production process."},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"I think it's fairly\neasy to imagine a future"},"672":{"dur":3,"text":"where smart machines are able\nto take over a great deal"},"676":{"dur":3,"text":"of the work

really important"},"692":{"dur":3,"text":"to articulate what\nexactly is different"},"695":{"dur":4,"text":"about this particular\ntechnology that we have today,"},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"and why it's dramatically\ndifferent"},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"from what we've seen\nin the past."},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"And I would point\ngenerally to three things"},"705":{"dur":3,"text":"that really set this\ntechnology apart."},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"The first thing is that\nwe've got this exponential"},"711":{"dur":1,"text":"acceleration going on."},"712":{"dur":1,"text":"I think most people have\nheard of Moore's Law"},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"which basically says that you\nknow computing power doubles"},"717":{"dur":1,"text":"roughly every two\nyears, or 18 months."},"719":{"dur":1,"text":"But it's actually much\nbroader than that."},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not just about\nincreasing hardware capability,"},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"actually in many cases we\nsee acceleration in software,"},"727":{"dur":0,"text":"we see it in terms"},"728":{"dur":1,"text":"of communications\nbandwidth and so forth."},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"But the really important thing\nto focus on is not just the fact"},"733":{"dur":1,"text":"that we have this\ndoubling going on,"},"735":{"dur":4,"text":"but rather that it's been\ngoing on for so long now."},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact, it's been\ngoing on for decades."},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"You can think of this in\nterms of getting into your car"},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"and starting out at about\n5 miles per hour so,"},"747":{"dur":1,"text":"and then gradually\ndoubling your speed."},"749":{"dur":1,"text":"If you were able to\ndo that a handful"},"750":{"dur":4,"text":"of times you need a race track\nand a better car probably."},"755":{"dur":3,"text":"If you could do it\n27 or 30 times"},"758":{"dur":1,"text":"which is roughly\nthe number of times"},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"that we've

being."},"768":{"dur":2,"text":"You would be travelling at\nmillions of miles per hour."},"771":{"dur":1,"text":"You would be a spaceship."},"772":{"dur":2,"text":"You would be capable of\ngetting to

happening now relative"},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"to what we saw in the past\nand that's why I think"},"784":{"dur":2,"text":"that things are going to\nunfold at a very rapid"},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"and often very surprising rate."},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"We're going to see\nthings develop that really"},"791":{"dur":1,"text":"in some cases astonish us."},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's largely driven by the\nfact that we are now moving"},"795":{"dur":3,"text":"so rapidly because this\nexponential doubling has been"},"799":{"dur":1,"text":"going on for so long."},"800":{"dur":3,"text":"The second quality that I would\npoint to is of course this fact"},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"that machines are now taking\non this cognitive capability."},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the point I was making\nwhen I was talking about horses."},"811":{"dur":3,"text":"Machines, in a limited\nsense can now think."},"814":{"dur":1,"text":"They can solve problems."},"816":{"dur":1,"text":"They can make decisions."},"817":{"dur":1,"text":"They can figure things out."},"818":{"dur":1,"text":"Most

data and based\non that make predictions."},"827":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think that\nmachine learning more"},"828":{"dur":1,"text":"than anything else\nis the technology"},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"that is really just\nkind of central to this."},"831":{"dur":3,"text":"It's just incredibly\nimportant and powerful."},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"And to sort of visualise the\nimpact of that you might think"},"838":{"dur":3,"text":"in terms of whether another\nsmart person might be able"},"841":{"dur":1,"text":"to learn to do your\njob by looking"},"843":{"dur":1,"text":"at a very detailed record"},"844":{"dur":1,"text":"of everything you've\ndone in the past."},"845":{"dur":1,"text":"If a smart person could do"},"847":{"dur":1,"text":"that then it's probably\na pretty good bet"},"849":{"dur":1,"text":"that someday there\nwill be an algorithm"},"850":{"dur":3,"text":"that might employ essentially\nthe same technique and learn"},"854":{"dur":2,"text":"to do that job and of course\nthe algorithm might be even more"},"857":{"dur":1,"text":"efficient than a\nperson would be."},"858":{"dur":1,"text":"So that gives you a\nsense of how many jobs"},"860":{"dur":1,"text":"out there are really going\nto be susceptible to this."},"862":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think that it's ultimately\ngoing to be a great number."},"865":{"dur":2,"text":"The third thing that's really\nimportant to understand is"},"867":{"dur":1,"text":"that this technology\nis ubiquitous."},"869":{"dur":0,"text":"It is everywhere."},"871":{"dur":2,"text":"It's what we now call a\ngeneral purpose technology."},"873":{"dur":1,"text":"It's quite different for example"},"875":{"dur":3,"text":"from the specialised\nmechanical technologies"},"878":{"dur":1,"text":"that transformed agriculture"},"880":{"dur":2,"text":"and eliminated millions\nof jobs on farms."},"883":{"dur":2,"text":"Those were specialised,\nthey hit one particular area"},"885":{"dur":0,"text":"of the economy."},"886":{"dur":2,"text":"Today what we see is\nmuch more generalised."},"889":{"dur":2,"text":"Information technology is going\nto impact across the board."},"892":{"dur":2,"text":"It's going to impact every\nsingle industry, every business,"},"894":{"dur":2,"text":"every organisation, every\npart of the economy."},"897":{"dur":0,"text":"And what that means is"},"898":{"dur":1,"text":"that there really\nisn't any safe haven."},"900":{"dur":3,"text":"There isn't a place where\nthis technology is not going"},"903":{"dur":2,"text":"to have an impact where workers\nwill be you know forever safe"},"906":{"dur":1,"text":"It's just across the board."},"908":{"dur":2,"text":"So when you put all those things\ntogether I think what you end"},"911":{"dur":2,"text":"up with is something that really\nlooks a bit like a utility."},"913":{"dur":3,"text":"It's almost like\nelectricity, except that instead"},"916":{"dur":2,"text":"of just

every organisation."},"930":{"dur":2,"text":"And one implication of\nit is that it's going"},"932":{"dur":1,"text":"to make everything\nless labour intensive."},"934":{"dur":2,"text":"It's going to mean fewer\nopportunities especially"},"937":{"dur":2,"text":"for what we might think\nof as average people"},"939":{"dur":1,"text":"with average capability."},"941":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think that that's\nsomething that's really going"},"943":{"dur":2,"text":"to have dramatic\nconsequences in the future."},"946":{"dur":5,"text":"So the point I've been making"},"951":{"dur":2,"text":"so far is how information\ntechnology is going to scale"},"954":{"dur":3,"text":"across our existing industries,\nbut one thing that people"},"957":{"dur":2,"text":"who are a bit sceptical\nwill rightly point
