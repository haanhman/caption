So let\u2019s get started.\nOur first question is from Kevin Shale. How"},"58":{"dur":6,"text":"will the federal government support your entrepreneurs\nstarting businesses geared to help fight against"},"64":{"dur":2,"text":"climate change?\nHON. CATHERINE MCKENNA: Wow! So thanks very"},"66":{"dur":5,"text":"much, Jen. That\u2019s a really, really great\nquestion because we know we need innovations,"},"71":{"dur":4,"text":"we need solutions. And actually, it was amazing\nthis morning, so Geoff Green with Students"},"76":{"dur":5,"text":"on Ice was showing examples of Canadian young\nentrepreneurs. One of the entrepreneurs came"},"81":{"dur":6,"text":"up with a solution where you use solar power\nto create clean water, something that can"},"87":{"dur":4,"text":"be used in the Arctic, something that can\nbe used in developing countries. So we need"},"92":{"dur":6,"text":"more solutions like that. And so we already\nhave some funding available through different"},"98":{"dur":5,"text":"programs, seed funding to help young entrepreneurs\nwhere they can get access to money to help"},"104":{"dur":4,"text":"with their initial solutions. We know that\nwe also, once you have a good solution, and"},"108":{"dur":4,"text":"you kind of got it going, you need more money\nto actually, you know, make sure that you"},"112":{"dur":5,"text":"can scale it up. So we\u2019re looking at: how\ndo we fund innovation?"},"118":{"dur":3,"text":"So I\u2019m working very hard with Minister Bains."},"121":{"dur":6,"text":"A really good guy who has the file on innovation."},"127":{"dur":2,"text":"But we know we need innovation."},"130":{"dur":7,"text":"So we look at how we can support youth, entrepreneurs, and scientists"},"137":{"dur":4,"text":"who have practical solutions to help fight climate change."},"142":{"dur":6,"text":"JEN COLLETTE: Super. All right, our next question"},"148":{"dur":6,"text":"is from Martin McGraw. Is Canada\u2019s government\ntrying to save our economy or environment?"},"154":{"dur":6,"text":"The way I see it, you can only focus on one,\nand Trudeau is clearly giving people jobs"},"161":{"dur":5,"text":"and stuff to save our economy. So is the environment\nless important to the eyes of our Prime Minister?"},"166":{"dur":4,"text":"HON. CATHERINE MCKENNA: Well, that\u2019s a really\ngood question, Martin. I have always said"},"171":{"dur":4,"text":"that the environment and the economy go together.\nYou can\u2019t have one with the other\u2026 without"},"176":{"dur":4,"text":"the other. You can\u2019t have a sustainable\neconomy if you don\u2019t take care of the environment."},"181":{"dur":3,"text":"And you can\u2019t do what you need in terms\nof environmental action unless you have a"},"185":{"dur":2,"text":"strong economy.\nAnd that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. That\u2019s"},"187":{"dur":5,"text":"why we\u2019ve taken serious measures. I\u2019ll\ngive you one example. Putting a price on pollution."},"192":{"dur":5,"text":"So we know that we want people to pollute\nless, and so when you have people polluting,"},"198":{"dur":5,"text":"if you put a price on it you raise revenues.\nSo if you pollute, you\u2019re going to pay more."},"204":{"dur":4,"text":"If you pollute less, you will pay less and\nyou\u2019ll innovate. And the money that provinces"},"208":{"dur":5,"text":"are getting from the price on pollution, they\ncan use to reinvest in the economy. And what"},"214":{"dur":7,"text":"we\u2019ve seen is, Ontario and Quebec, their\npriority: electric vehicles, energy efficiency."},"222":{"dur":4,"text":"And so there are different ways, different\nsolutions. But I think you have\u2026 we have"},"227":{"dur":5,"text":"to be serious about both, and for a long time,\nit\u2019s been an either\/or. And I\u2019m all about"},"232":{"dur":4,"text":"making sure that we build a sustainable and\nprosperous future for our children."},"236":{"dur":5,"text":"JEN COLLETTE: Awesome. Thanks very much. Pierre\nPerrera has a shorter question but a really"},"242":{"dur":4,"text":"important one and he asks: How can we get\ninvolved?"},"246":{"dur":5,"text":"HON. CATHERINE MCKENNA:\nThank you, Pierre, you\u2019re already committed."},"252":{"dur":6,"text":"\u2026 your question. So, first of all, thanks\nfor that because it is really important that"},"258":{"dur":7,"text":"everyone is part of this. So I was in Marrakesh\nat COP22 and I had business leaders, environmentalists,"},"265":{"dur":3,"text":"youth, provinces and territories, and that\u2019s\nthe only way we\u2019re going to tackle climate"},"269":{"dur":4,"text":"change. So I think there are local ways that\nyou can do that. There are a lot of great"},"273":{"dur":4,"text":"local environmental organizations, everything\nfrom organizations that are focused on clean"},"278":{"dur":3,"text":"water in their community.\nI know in Ottawa we have the Ottawa River"},"281":{"dur":5,"text":"Keeper, a really great organization, making\nsure we keep the water clean. You can get"},"287":{"dur":5,"text":"engaged through school, through\u2026 we were\ntalking about innovations. We need new innovations,"},"292":{"dur":4,"text":"so I don\u2019t know how old Pierre is, but you\nknow, if you\u2019re in science class, are there"},"296":{"dur":4,"text":"ways that you can look at how do we use solar\nenergy? How do we use tidal energy? There"},"300":{"dur":4,"text":"was a great initiative in Nova Scotia where\nthey\u2019re starting to use tidal energy."},"305":{"dur":6,"text":"And so it\u2019s just different ways, however\nyou, where you can bring your skillset, and"},"311":{"dur":5,"text":"whether it\u2019s getting people excited about\nclimate action by starting your own organization,"},"317":{"dur":5,"text":"or through, you know, inventions, through\nscience. So there\u2019s many, many different"},"322":{"dur":4,"text":"ways to get engaged and I think that\u2019s how\neveryone can contribute in their own way."},"327":{"dur":4,"text":"JEN COLLETTE: Excellent, and I think today\nis a great reminder that each of us has that"},"331":{"dur":3,"text":"responsibility to take some action on climate\nchange."},"335":{"dur":6,"text":"Our next question is from Grayson Bark, and\nGrayson asks: Has Canada committed to the"},"342":{"dur":4,"text":"phase out of fossil fuels by 2050? Why? Or\nwhy not?"},"346":{"dur":4,"text":"HON. CATHERINE MCKENNA: So that\u2019s another\nreally great question, and we know we need"},"351":{"dur":4,"text":"to be moving to clean energy. We know it\u2019s\na transition, so you can\u2019t do it overnight."},"355":{"dur":4,"text":"We still need to turn the lights on.

So there we\u2019re talking about\nreducing our dependence by 80% on fossil fuels."},"384":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean look, we would love to do more and\nI think innovation is certainly part of it,"},"389":{"dur":4,"text":"and sending signals like pricing pollution\nso that we come up with inventions."},"393":{"dur":4,"text":"And so we\u2019re going to keep on doing absolutely\neverything we can to put ourselves in a more"},"397":{"dur":6,"text":"sustainable path and be more and more ambitious.\nJEN COLLETTE: Great. Thank you for that response."},"404":{"dur":6,"text":"Our next question is from Abby Murphy, and\nshe asks: What are some ways as a student"},"410":{"dur":5,"text":"\u2013 I think you spoke to this a little bit\nin your previous response for Pierre \u2013 what"},"415":{"dur":4,"text":"are some ways that I as a student can make\na change in my everyday life?"},"420":{"dur":3,"text":"HON. CATHERINE MCKENNA: Well, that\u2019s a really\u2026\nthat\u2019s another really great question. So"},"423":{"dur":6,"text":"I just met with an amazing young woman and\nshe came up with a list. What she did is she"},"429":{"dur":4,"text":"polled her friends and she said: Okay, what\ndo you think we should be doing, what can"},"434":{"dur":4,"text":"you do, what can I do to reduce our impact\nto the environment? She had a whole list,"},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"so it\u2019s pretty awesome. Maybe we\u2019ll be\nable to share the list. One of the things"},"441":{"dur":5,"text":"she was really focused on was plastic bags.\nWe know that plastic bags are a massive problem"},"446":{"dur":7,"text":"that you have now huge, huge collections of\nplastic bags in the oceans, so like the size"},"454":{"dur":6,"text":"of Texas in some cases, and you have animals\nthat are dying because they ingest them. So"},"461":{"dur":3,"text":"that\u2019s what, you know, it\u2019s a small example:\nhow do you just stop using plastic?"},"464":{"dur":5,"text":"And the young people are very good at that.\nBut you know we can certainly also encourage"},"469":{"dur":6,"text":"older people \u2013 parents and grandparents\n\u2013 recycling is something that you can do."},"476":{"dur":5,"text":"Taking your bike, using your bike more often,\nit\u2019s a lot nicer.

CATHERINE MCKENNA: Reverse mentoring."},"490":{"dur":4,"text":"JEN COLLETTE: Youth can absolutely have a\ngreat impact on those of us who have been"},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"around maybe a little bit longer.\nHON. CATHERINE MCKENNA: You know, that\u2019s"},"496":{"dur":4,"text":"what I always\u2026 when I have young people\nwho are really excited, often kids, they say:"},"501":{"dur":4,"text":"What can I do?

And she asks: How can we inspire\nothers to want to make that difference as"},"525":{"dur":4,"text":"well so that more of an impact can be made?\nHON. CATHERINE MCKENNA: So I think the best"},"529":{"dur":4,"text":"way to inspire people is to tell stories.\nThat\u2019s what I try to do. I try to collect"},"534":{"dur":5,"text":"stories. I\u2019m always inspired when I have\npeople tell me stories. So, Maatalii, I talked"},"539":{"dur":6,"text":"about her, a young Inuit woman talking about\nher homeland and the impacts that we\u2019re"},"546":{"dur":6,"text":"seeing\u2026 that she\u2019s seeing on her homeland.\nWe saw a video from the Native Women\u2019s Association"},"552":{"dur":4,"text":"and it was just talking about flooding, a\nyoung woman talking about the flooding in"},"557":{"dur":5,"text":"her community and how the climate change is\nhaving\u2026 resulting in extreme weather events"},"562":{"dur":4,"text":"which is actually tearing apart her community.\nAnd I think those stories, talking about stories,"},"567":{"dur":3,"text":"talking about real things that, you know,\npeople can understand and really understand"},"571":{"dur":5,"text":"the real impacts, and also the opportunity\nto build a stronger and better Canada, a more"},"576":{"dur":3,"text":"sustainable Canada, if we take action. I think\nthat\u2019s the way to get people inspired."},"579":{"dur":3,"text":"JEN COLLETTE: Excellent, thank you.

CATHERINE MCKENNA: So great to have you\nhere."},"609":{"dur":4,"text":"JEN COLLETTE: So, Alex, I have one question\nto get your conversation started."},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"ALEX BENAY: Sure.\nJEN COLLETTE: And I was hoping that you would"},"615":{"dur":6,"text":"share with us, what sort of role do you see\nthat public institutions like the museums"},"621":{"dur":3,"text":"play in terms of inspiring youth to take action\non climate change?"},"625":{"dur":4,"text":"ALEX BENAY: Right. I think museums, historically,\nand science -- many more museums have been"},"629":{"dur":4,"text":"a place that have told you your culture historically.\nI think in this day and age, and more and"},"633":{"dur":3,"text":"more with youth as well, it\u2019s more\u2026 it\u2019s\nmore a place of dialogue and it\u2019s more a"},"637":{"dur":5,"text":"place of co-development of culture, of ideas.\nIt\u2019s a safe haven. So in a topic like climate"},"643":{"dur":5,"text":"change which is so polarizing, very emotional\nas well for some people, museums offer a bit"},"648":{"dur":4,"text":"of a safe haven where people can share their\nideas, their dialogues, be respectful about"},"652":{"dur":4,"text":"it in the process and be very inclusive.\nSo I do think we\u2019ve got an important role"},"657":{"dur":3,"text":"to play in this dialogue on climate change\nof bringing people together. And if you were"},"660":{"dur":4,"text":"to extrapolate or expand that on a global\nscene, I think those, a lot of the things"},"664":{"dur":5,"text":"I\u2019ve just mentioned \u2013 inclusiveness, dialogue,\nrespect \u2013 they\u2019re all Canadian values"},"670":{"dur":5,"text":"as well. So we have an even larger role to\nplay we think on a global scale."},"675":{"dur":4,"text":"So for us museums, it\u2019s a natural reflection\nof Canada\u2019s values and we think we\u2019re"},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"an important part of the discussion. We\u2019re\nhappy to be here today and we have quite a"},"683":{"dur":4,"text":"bit of programming that goes on across Canada.\nLet\u2019s Talk Energy Program literally criss-crosses"},"688":{"dur":3,"text":"east to west and north and south across the\ncountry, engaging youth all over Canada on"},"692":{"dur":4,"text":"this discussion. So we hear about it every\nday and it\u2019s certainly part of our fabric,"},"696":{"dur":3,"text":"and we\u2019ve heard all the opinions and we\u2019re\nnot here to take a position. We\u2019re here"},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"to try to help people understand the issue,\ntry to educate people a little bit on the"},"704":{"dur":3,"text":"science behind climate change, and just try\nto bring people together because that\u2019s"},"707":{"dur":1,"text":"what it\u2019s going to take to solve this issue\nglobally."},"709":{"dur":6,"text":"HON. CATHERINE MCKENNA: So one really cool\nthing, Let\u2019s Talk Energy, so I saw an exhibition"},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"that you had here in Ottawa-Centre at Lansdowne.\nALEX BENAY: Yup."},"718":{"dur":3,"text":"HON. CATHERINE MCKENNA: And it had a bunch\nof different pictures and it was kind of telling"},"722":{"dur":4,"text":"a story. It was pictures from the Arctic with\nsome scientists there that were looking at"},"726":{"dur":4,"text":"the impact of climate change on birds. Then\nyou had Canadian solutions. And then I heard"},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"you say, you know, we brought this exhibition\naround the world, including to Mexico."},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"ALEX BENAY: Yup.\nHON. CATHERINE MCKENNA: So what\u2019s the reaction"},"737":{"dur":3,"text":"of people that go see this? I found it quite\nmoving -- the pictures -- but what are you"},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"seeing?\nALEX BENAY: Yeah, I mean that exhibition kind"},"742":{"dur":4,"text":"of maybe reflects the nature of the problem\nin that sense. It\u2019s a partnership with National"},"746":{"dur":4,"text":"Geographic, so it\u2019s with our friends down\nsouth of the border. It\u2019s travelling around"},"751":{"dur":4,"text":"the world because this is a global problem.\nSo, I mean, these pictures are very striking."},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"They\u2019re meant to be striking. They\u2019re\nmeant to cause an emotion. But then we wanted"},"760":{"dur":4,"text":"to add to this that this isn\u2019t just a problem,\nit\u2019s an opportunity."},"764":{"dur":7,"text":"Now your earlier question around economy or\nenvironment, well, they\u2019re one and the same."},"772":{"dur":7,"text":"So one and the same. So for us\u2026 (experiencing\naudio problems \u2013 technical adjustments made)."},"780":{"dur":1,"text":"There we go. Good. I have no idea where I\nwas at, but let\u2019s just say that environment"},"781":{"dur":6,"text":"and the economy are a related issue. So we\u2019ve\nbeen able to show multiple facets of the problem."},"788":{"dur":4,"text":"We wanted to criss-cross this across Canada,\nlike everything else we do, but then all of"},"792":{"dur":3,"text":"a sudden people in Mexico became very interested\nin it, so now it\u2019s trilingual. It\u2019s in"},"795":{"dur":5,"text":"Mexico City as we speak, scheduled to go to\nWashington after. There\u2019s about 15,000 people"},"800":{"dur":3,"text":"a day that are going to get to see this in\nMexico City where it\u2019s at at the conference"},"804":{"dur":2,"text":"centre.\nSo yeah, it\u2019s a tremendous response and"},"807":{"dur":4,"text":"it\u2019s just another way to try to engage people\nin the conversation -- physically this time,"},"811":{"dur":2,"text":"not just digitally -- but, you know, a mix\nof mediums. So it\u2019s been very fun."},"813":{"dur":3,"text":"HON. CATHERINE MCKENNA: So speaking of \u2018physically,\u2019\nI was on a bike that you guys had this morning."},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"ALEX BENAY: Yeah.\nHON. CATHERINE MCKENNA: So I had to pedal"},"819":{"dur":2,"text":"the bike so I could charge my phone.\nALEX BENAY: Yeah, you probably pedalled it"},"821":{"dur":1,"text":"better than I did in Calgary last time I did\nit."},"823":{"dur":2,"text":"HON.

CATHERINE MCKENNA: But tell me like about\nthese things where you actually are showing"},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"solutions, like cool solutions. So that was\na cool one. Any other examples?"},"837":{"dur":5,"text":"ALEX BENAY: Yeah. No, I mean we do a lot of,\nmaybe not as physically demanding, a lot of"},"842":{"dur":1,"text":"speaker series across Canada.\nHON. CATHERINE MCKENNA: Good!"},"844":{"dur":3,"text":"ALEX BENAY: Yeah, the bike for me the first\ntime I got in, they made me go on against"},"847":{"dur":5,"text":"an Olympian in Calgary, so it was horrible\nfor me. I lost hands down. But I mean, the"},"853":{"dur":4,"text":"bike has been extremely popular. It\u2019s been\nto malls. We try to go as a museum not in"},"857":{"dur":4,"text":"places where people would associate museums.\nLike we go to malls, we go to Comic-Con festivals,"},"862":{"dur":3,"text":"we go to a bunch of places where people are\nto engage with them.

CATHERINE MCKENNA: With Red Bull."},"880":{"dur":3,"text":"ALEX BENAY: Yeah, with Red Bull, yeah. So\nit\u2019s about making it fun in the process."},"883":{"dur":4,"text":"Like, I mean, sometimes museums have a stigma\nthat you go and, again, you\u2019re told\u2026 it\u2019s"},"888":{"dur":3,"text":"not really the reality of things sometimes\n-- certainly not in the science and tech world"},"891":{"dur":4,"text":"but\u2026 so we\u2019re having fun in the process,\nwe\u2019re challenging people into dialogue in"},"895":{"dur":5,"text":"a respectful way, and try to see if we can\u2019t\nhave a little bit of reaction from people"},"901":{"dur":3,"text":"in some of the things we do. So the bike is\none, the glacier is one, the climate change"},"905":{"dur":1,"text":"exhibition\u2019s another.\nHON.
