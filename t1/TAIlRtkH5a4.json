in addition to a\nlot of this, Hazel,"},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"you're doing some very\nexciting things with,"},"382":{"dur":1,"text":"the Open University,\nlike you say,"},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"isn't just teaching materials."},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"We've got things like digital\nmicroscopes and various ways"},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"of actually connecting\nstudents that are very,

though."},"396":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, some of this is\nfreely available to everybody."},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"Most of it is just for\nOpen University students."},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's really cool."},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"And there is a huge\namount of material"},"408":{"dur":3,"text":"that students couldn't\npossibly engage"},"411":{"dur":2,"text":"with if they were at one\nof those other institutions"},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"where you have to go\nfull-time face-to-face."},"416":{"dur":4,"text":"So exciting things, such as,\noperating a telescope

our\nresearchers then,"},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"in some cases working\nwith the students,"},"437":{"dur":1,"text":"can then go on and\npublish and actually"},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"push back the

he?"},"457":{"dur":0,"text":"That will be a\nvery good session."},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"So check the programme out."},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that's at 7\no'clock tomorrow

think\nwe got all of that."},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"So I could I ask you in\nterms of the higher education"},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"sector, why is this\nsuch an important thing?"},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"And how is this\nimpacting in terms"},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"of Open University study and\nchanges in terms of the things"},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"we're trying to\ndeliver for students?"},"480":{"dur":1,"text":"PETER HORROCKS:\nLots of the learning"},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"that we provide has always\nbeen about supporting people"},"484":{"dur":1,"text":"in their career goals."},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"And we've had people who've been\nsupported by their employers,"},"488":{"dur":1,"text":"paying for them or\ngiving them time"},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"to be able to study with us."},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's always been an\nimportant part of a large number"},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"of our subject areas."},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"But what's happening,\nwhich is meaning"},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"that it's going to\nincrease further,"},"499":{"dur":4,"text":"is the government's asking\nall big employers to pay a tax"},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"to help create a fund of\nmoney to be able to support"},"507":{"dur":0,"text":"apprenticeships."},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"And not just apprenticeships\nthat are kind of trade"},"510":{"dur":3,"text":"and craft apprenticeships,\nbut degree apprenticeships"},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"so people can be supported\nin their learning to be able"},"517":{"dur":3,"text":"to get honours qualification."},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"And the great thing about it\nfrom a student point of view,"},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"or an employee point of view,\nis that that's going to be free."},"526":{"dur":1,"text":"And we know that\nquite a lot of people"},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"haven't been able\nto study with us"},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"because they've been\nconcerned about them taking"},"531":{"dur":3,"text":"on the extra debt that comes\nwith the higher fees that"},"535":{"dur":3,"text":"came in a few years\nago, in England this is."},"538":{"dur":1,"text":"And so, degree\napprenticeships are"},"539":{"dur":1,"text":"going to provide people\nwith the opportunity"},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"to study for those\nvocational type degrees"},"544":{"dur":1,"text":"without having to pay."},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"And we think that's going to\nbe a very exciting opportunity"},"548":{"dur":4,"text":"for many of the students who the\nOU wants to be able to serve."},"552":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Such\nan attractive idea"},"553":{"dur":1,"text":"for people, especially\npeople who are"},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"wanting to change vocations."},"556":{"dur":1,"text":"But a lot of people\nmay not know."},"558":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, the Open\nUniversity has already"},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"been doing a lot of vocational\nsupport, and social work,"},"562":{"dur":1,"text":"and nursing for\nexample, at the moment."},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's something that's\nquite at the heart of what"},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"we're doing anyway."},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"But this is quite a\nnew offering in terms"},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"of some of the packages that\nare available for students."},"571":{"dur":0,"text":"PETER HORROCKS: It is."},"572":{"dur":3,"text":"So there are three\ndegree apprenticeships"},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"that we are going to be\noffering in this calendar year."},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"And then, there'll be\nmore that will come."},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's a digital\none, a health care one,"},"583":{"dur":3,"text":"and a technology one,\nthe computing one."},"587":{"dur":1,"text":"They're not going\nto necessarily be"},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"right for people\nwho are moving jobs,"},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"or they will have to\nhave a job to go to."},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"Because you've got to be\nin employment, obviously,"},"597":{"dur":1,"text":"to do an apprenticeship."},"598":{"dur":3,"text":"But it could be someone\nwho's starting in a new job."},"602":{"dur":1,"text":"Or it could be\nsomeone who's wanting"},"603":{"dur":4,"text":"to increase their level\nof skill within a field"},"607":{"dur":1,"text":"that they're already working in."},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"So these will be really\nexciting opportunities."},"611":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Excellent."},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you for filling\nus in on all of that."},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"You've mentioned some\nof the other areas"},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"beforehand about

Well there are\nnew loans that, again, this"},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"is largely about in England."},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"There are different\nmechanisms in Wales, Scotland,"},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"and Northern Ireland."},"629":{"dur":5,"text":"So for instance, next year in\n2018, new loans for maintenance"},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"So part-time students,\nup until now,"},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"have never been able to get\nany support with living costs."},"641":{"dur":3,"text":"Whereas, full-time students\nhave had access either to loans,"},"645":{"dur":1,"text":"or in some cases to grants."},"646":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's going\nto change and be"},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"available for\npart-time students."},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"Later this year, we also\nsee the availability"},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"of loans for all of the STEM\nsubjects, all of the science,"},"656":{"dur":3,"text":"technology, engineering,\nand math subjects."},"659":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's going to be another\nreal boost for people who've"},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"already got another\ndegree but want"},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"to be able to study\na STEM subject."},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"They'll be able to get\nloans from the government"},"670":{"dur":1,"text":"to be able to\nsupport their study."},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"So a number of areas where\nnew things are coming in,"},"674":{"dur":1,"text":"which will increase\nthe opportunities

Hazel"},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"about how students might\nmake the most of that."},"716":{"dur":1,"text":"So when you started,\nyou obviously"},"717":{"dur":1,"text":"knew the Open University."},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"But how did you sort of\nstart navigating things?"},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"And what advice would\nyou give to students"},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"who do have very
