AdMob"},"26":{"dur":3,"text":"and we sold it for 750 million dollars,"},"31":{"dur":4,"text":"that gave me an opportunity, I suppose,\nto re-evaluate my life and goals"},"35":{"dur":2,"text":"and decide what I wanted to do next."},"37":{"dur":4,"text":"And, my idea was basically,\nto help the UK to be"},"42":{"dur":3,"text":"a better place to start\nand run a tech startup."},"45":{"dur":2,"text":"That was my big, hairy ambition,"},"47":{"dur":3,"text":"and obviously, the emphasis there was on\nhelping rather than doing it all myself."},"51":{"dur":3,"text":"I did that in two ways: first of all,"},"60":{"dur":2,"text":"what I identified as being\none of the most important things"},"63":{"dur":4,"text":"was investing in startups and helping\nthem financially to get going."},"68":{"dur":4,"text":"But probably the most important part\nof it was actually to become a mentor."},"72":{"dur":5,"text":"This gentleman, on your right,\nis the original mentor, called Mentor,"},"78":{"dur":2,"text":"fair enough, from whom we get the name."},"80":{"dur":6,"text":"And he helped Telemachus to be inspired\nto go off and do whatever he was doing."},"87":{"dur":3,"text":"Mentor himself actually\nwasn't a very good teacher."},"90":{"dur":3,"text":"He was occasionally occupied\nby the goddess Athena"},"93":{"dur":2,"text":"who used him as a sort of vehicle\nto give great advice,"},"96":{"dur":2,"text":"and that is where the name came from."},"98":{"dur":2,"text":"Unlike a lot of angel investors,"},"101":{"dur":4,"text":"I wanted to actually get involved\nand mentor the companies I invested in."},"108":{"dur":4,"text":"Since then I've invested in 25 companies,\nand I've also joined the government"},"113":{"dur":4,"text":"to help startups fundraise\nin what's called the Afterburner program,"},"117":{"dur":2,"text":"which I will talk about\na little more in a minute."},"120":{"dur":3,"text":"I've also joined Techstars accelerator\nwhich helps startups,"},"124":{"dur":2,"text":"and in total, I've mentored"},"126":{"dur":3,"text":"around 100 companies\nsince I started to do this."},"130":{"dur":3,"text":"These are the particularly successful ones\nthat have gone on to raise"},"133":{"dur":2,"text":"Series A funding\nfrom venture capitalists,"},"135":{"dur":3,"text":"so they are well on their way\nto becoming hopefully future AdMob's."},"139":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, why mentoring is important?"},"142":{"dur":3,"text":"Is something I've noticed while I've been\nmentoring these 100-odd companies,"},"146":{"dur":3,"text":"is that how these founders\nthink about mentoring"},"150":{"dur":2,"text":"actually is a predictor of their success."},"152":{"dur":4,"text":"The ones who attract mentors,\nattract lots of mentors,"},"157":{"dur":4,"text":"and then actually manage to be\nsingularly disrespectful of their time."},"161":{"dur":4,"text":"In other words, they get much more time\nout of these important people"},"165":{"dur":4,"text":"than they would\nperhaps deserve, is a real skill."},"169":{"dur":2,"text":"Something which these guys have mastered,"},"172":{"dur":3,"text":"and hopefully, will go on to master\nfor other people as well."},"176":{"dur":2,"text":"But I think the corollary is also true."},"179":{"dur":5,"text":"The people who don't master mentoring,\nnever seem to get off the ground."},"184":{"dur":3,"text":"So if I invest in a company,\nand I don't hear from them for a month,"},"187":{"dur":2,"text":"I've sort of mentally written them off,"},"189":{"dur":2,"text":"because they are not going\nto master the skill."},"191":{"dur":3,"text":"They think they are going to be doing it\non their own, and that's a fallacy."},"195":{"dur":1,"text":"They won't be able to do it."},"196":{"dur":4,"text":"So great mentors attract great founders,\nand great founders attract great mentors,"},"201":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's important to understand."},"203":{"dur":3,"text":"So what does mentoring mean exactly?"},"206":{"dur":4,"text":"First of all, it's somebody who is going\nto help you repeat their success."},"211":{"dur":1,"text":"Somebody who has done it before"},"213":{"dur":3,"text":"and who will help you\non your journey in startup world,"},"216":{"dur":2,"text":"or indeed any new skill\nyou're likely to master."},"219":{"dur":2,"text":"As an example, if you want to learn polo,"},"222":{"dur":2,"text":"the person who is going to be able\nto teach you best"},"225":{"dur":2,"text":"is the best person\nyou know who can play polo."},"227":{"dur":3,"text":"Not somebody who doesn't know\nhow to mount a horse."},"230":{"dur":3,"text":"It can actually be around\none specific area."},"233":{"dur":3,"text":"For instance, we often hear these days\nof young people mentoring older people"},"237":{"dur":2,"text":"about things like social\nnetworking and technology."},"240":{"dur":2,"text":"But where it's effective\nin my life about mentoring"},"243":{"dur":2,"text":"is the Afterburner program\nI mentioned before."},"245":{"dur":4,"text":"In the UK, startups find it difficult\nto go on to raise Series A funding,"},"250":{"dur":3,"text":"so it's quite easy to raise\ntheir initial little seed fund round,"},"253":{"dur":1,"text":"but to go and get a venture capitalist"},"255":{"dur":4,"text":"to actually invest in you\nand your company is notoriously difficult."},"259":{"dur":5,"text":"So when I joined the government I was\nasked how we would tackle this issue."},"265":{"dur":3,"text":"Having a little bit of experience in this"},"268":{"dur":3,"text":"I decided that the fundamental issue\nwasn't the companies weren't good enough,"},"272":{"dur":1,"text":"it's just that they weren't very good"},"274":{"dur":2,"text":"at actually raising money\nfrom venture capitalists."},"277":{"dur":3,"text":"They didn't know what to say,\ntheir pitch decks weren't very good,"},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"their presentation style wasn't very good"},"282":{"dur":3,"text":"so mentoring around a specific topic which\nyou want to master is really important."},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm pleased to say\nthat with Charles [surname]"},"288":{"dur":3,"text":"my colleague out in California\nwho helps with this process,"},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"that since April of last year, April 2014,"},"294":{"dur":4,"text":"we've gone on to raise 50 million dollars\nfor the companies we've been mentoring."},"299":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think that proves that mentoring\naround a subject, as well as generally,"},"302":{"dur":1,"text":"kind of works."},"304":{"dur":3,"text":"You want to avoid bad actors."},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"(Laughter)"},"309":{"dur":4,"text":"Unfortunately, Sylvester Stallone won\nthe Worst Actor of the 20th Century Award"},"314":{"dur":3,"text":"in the Raspberry's recently."},"317":{"dur":3,"text":"But in the context of mentoring\nwhat does that mean?"},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, I think there are two things:"},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"one of which is\nhave they done this before?"},"324":{"dur":1,"text":"That's really important."},"326":{"dur":3,"text":"A lot of people try to get into mentoring\nwhen they aren't ready,"},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"or they haven't got\nthe right skills to teach."},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"But I think more importantly\nit's an attitude thing;"},"334":{"dur":1,"text":"why are they doing it?"},"335":{"dur":3,"text":"The best mentor relationships don't\nstart off as a financial arrangement."},"339":{"dur":2,"text":"You shouldn't be paying your mentors."},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"Although that relationship\nmight change over time."},"343":{"dur":1,"text":"But the most important thing"},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"is that they agree to give you\ntheir time and effort"},"347":{"dur":3,"text":"because they believe in you,\nand your vision, and your idea."},"350":{"dur":3,"text":"So if they're asking\nfor money from day one,"},"354":{"dur":3,"text":"it's completely the wrong choice\nin a mentor and you should run a mile."},"358":{"dur":3,"text":"But the other thing is that mentors\nare like any other employee,"},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"you need to take references out on them."},"363":{"dur":3,"text":"So just so somebody\nwants to be your mentor"},"366":{"dur":3,"text":"and you think that they have succeeded,\nI think you should talk to your peers,"},"370":{"dur":2,"text":"your colleagues, other people\nthey've mentored in the past,"},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"and find out if they've\nreally done a good job."},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"Chemistry is also really important."},"379":{"dur":3,"text":"You got to spend time with these people,\nthey've got to share your values."},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"And you've got to enjoy\neach other's company"},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"because hopefully it's going\nto be a long, long journey together,"},"388":{"dur":3,"text":"you'll be seeing each other regularly,\nand it's important you get along."},"394":{"dur":3,"text":"The most important quality\nof a mentor is to tell you the truth"},"398":{"dur":4,"text":"in a completely unadulterated fashion,\nif you like in a blunt fashion."},"402":{"dur":4,"text":"You don't want people to sugar coat\ntheir words and their advice."},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you cannot take their bluntness,"},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"you shouldn't really be\nan entrepreneur in the first place."},"412":{"dur":3,"text":"In criticism and helping you\navoid the rocks on your journey"},"415":{"dur":1,"text":"is really really important,"},"417":{"dur":3,"text":"so they must be prepared to tell\nthe pure, unadulterated truth,"},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"and you must be prepared to listen."},"423":{"dur":4,"text":"I think the most important skill\nof the mentor is to be a great listener."},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"If they do not listen to you\nand your problems,"},"430":{"dur":3,"text":"how are they really going to solve\nthem and think them through?"},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"In my head there are two types\nof successful people:"},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"one of whom is very ego driven."},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"They like the sound of their own voice"},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"and when you listen to them,\nor overhear them"},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"giving a mentoring session\nto somebody else,"},"446":{"dur":3,"text":"it is all about them,\nand they are talking all the time."},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"But actually, that's not\nvery helpful for you."},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"You don't want to know what they've done,"},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"you want their opinion\non what you've done."},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"So being a listener\nand an effective listener,"},"458":{"dur":3,"text":"and then telling that truth back to you\nis the most important thing."},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"It is also very important\nfrom a mentor's point of view"},"465":{"dur":3,"text":"to take a step back and realize you are\nno longer the one in the driving seat."},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"Your job is to advise,\nto whisper in their ear,"},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"to help them through their problems,"},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"but at the end of the day\nit is their decisions."},"476":{"dur":4,"text":"The reason why those successful people\nI've mentioned earlier are great founders"},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"is because they ask\nlots of people their advice,"},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"and they listen to lots of advice,"},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"and then they come up\nwith their own decision."},"487":{"dur":3,"text":"They are in the driver's seat,\nand it is no longer the entrepreneur"},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"or the mentor who is actually being\nthe successful one here."},"494":{"dur":3,"text":"A mentor needs to be upbeat and positive."},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"God knows being a founder,\nan entrepreneur,"},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"is a really tough thing to do."},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"It's probably the most tough thing\nyou can ever do in business."},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's going to be a rocky ride\neven in the best startups."},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"So your mentors need to be\nyour greatest supporters"},"512":{"dur":3,"text":"and help lift you up when you feel down."},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"And when you are going through that grind\nwhen everything seems to be going wrong,"},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"they are your cheerleader."},"521":{"dur":1,"text":"So how do you get a mentor?"},"523":{"dur":1,"text":"Easier said than done."},"525":{"dur":3,"text":"I think the hack here, the easy way\nto do it if you were a startup"},"528":{"dur":4,"text":"is to join one of the world-class\naccelerator programs that exist these days"},"533":{"dur":5,"text":"which are very much driven by mentoring."},"539":{"dur":4,"text":"TechStars is one I mentor at, in London."},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"But there are 1,500 applications\nfor every 10 seeds."},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's pretty tough competition."},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"Y Combinator is another great one."},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"You can tell by an accelerator\nhow effective they are"},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"by the quality of their mentors."},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not just about the people\nthey've got on their website,"},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"it's are they going to work hard\nand actually do some mentoring,"},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"rather than just lend their names to it."},"566":{"dur":5,"text":"It's not for everybody,\ngoing to an accelerator."},"571":{"dur":5,"text":"How would you go about doing that\nif you didn't go into an accelerator?"},"576":{"dur":1,"text":"Well,, there are a couple of ways:"},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"one of which is you can ask them\nfor a cup of coffee."},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"Seriously, never ask them\nfor a cup of coffee."},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"I get 80 cups of coffee offers\nevery month,"},"587":{"dur":3,"text":"and even in the best possible way\nI could never take it all up."},"591":{"dur":6,"text":"It's also, even if I wanted to,\nan impossible use of my time."},"597":{"dur":4,"text":"And anyway it's not being very creative\nat the end of the day, as an entrepreneur."},"601":{"dur":6,"text":"You need to tap into\nyour inner-Steve Jobs,"},"607":{"dur":3,"text":"your genius of your foundership,"},"610":{"dur":4,"text":"and work at how you can\nactually get peoples attention."},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"So, one way, as an example,\nwhich I've seen very effective"},"618":{"dur":3,"text":"is to find out what your\nprospective mentor wants in life,"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"what they are interested in,\nand see if you can be useful."},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"So perhaps your expected mentor\nwill be giving a TEDx talk"},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"in a couple of months time,\nand could you help with the slides,"},"631":{"dur":3,"text":"could you help with the sounding board,\ncould you help them rehearse,"},"634":{"dur":1,"text":"that would be an example."},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"Or if they are really into charity,\ncan you help them in some way?"},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"Another very effective way\nI've seen doing it"},"641":{"dur":3,"text":"is to ask them a specific question\nand ask for a 10 minute Skype call."},"645":{"dur":3,"text":"That's very easy for me to turn down\nan hour's cup of coffee,"},"648":{"dur":1,"text":"but I'll probably make the time,"},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"as indeed most people\nwho are into mentoring,"},"653":{"dur":4,"text":"to discuss a very specific topic\naround a ten-minute Skype call."},"657":{"dur":3,"text":"So again, that's a starting point,\nand once you've started"},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"you can start building the relationship,\nand who knows where it is going to end?"},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"So I suppose my message today"},"667":{"dur":4,"text":"really is if you're a young person\nwanting to make your way in the world,"},"672":{"dur":5,"text":"mentoring is a very important tool,\nand it can accelerate your success."},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"That's particularly the case\nif you are a startup"},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"but also if you want\nto learn any specific skill,"},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"ask someone who has done it before\nto be your guide."},"685":{"dur":3,"text":"And the other thing I'd like to say\nis that if you have skills"},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"which the world can share,\nyou want to be a mentor,"},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"it is tremendously satisfying,"},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"and I urge you\nto take the plunge, it is great."},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you very much."},"695":{"dur":1,"text":"(Applause)"}}
