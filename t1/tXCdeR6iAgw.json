handful\nof different studies,"},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"some of them are sort of\njust looking at it outside."},"690":{"dur":3,"text":"So we find a correlation\nor relationship

psychological\nprocesses that can"},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"So there is this tendency,\npeople don't have a good sense"},"706":{"dur":4,"text":"that we rely on available\ninformation in a way"},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"that doesn't actually sort of comport with"},"712":{"dur":3,"text":"what the actual information\nwe should be using."},"716":{"dur":1,"text":"And so if today happens to be

that that's true."},"724":{"dur":1,"text":"But beyond that, we actually found that"},"725":{"dur":1,"text":"the actual physical experience of warmth"},"727":{"dur":1,"text":"is also playing a role in

they come in,\nand then take that out,"},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"that people will also\nreport feeling more strongly"},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"when they're in the warm cubicle

the Earth warming,"},"782":{"dur":1,"text":"but maybe that's even more clear"},"784":{"dur":2,"text":"with a practical example so\nwe have people eat pretzels"},"786":{"dur":1,"text":"to get thirsty and they think that"},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"drought is more likely to occur."},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"And what we find with the\nglobal warming in particular"},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"is that what's happening\nis that when people"},"795":{"dur":3,"text":"are feeling warm, they are\nsimulating, they're imagining,"},"798":{"dur":2,"text":"a world that is, sort of, more,"},"802":{"dur":1,"text":"it's easier, they have a\nclearer mental representation"},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"of what a world plagued by\nglobal warming would look like."},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"So, sort of, pictures of hot\ndeserts and things like that"},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"are clearer to them than to\npeople who aren't in that room."},"812":{"dur":3,"text":"And that clarity seems to\nbe driving their judgment."},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"So it seems to be that feeling\nwarm just makes it easier"},"819":{"dur":2,"text":"to imagine that this is gonna happen,"},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"and
