longevity and optimal health"},"32":{"dur":3,"text":"is to abandon\nour modern agricultural diets,"},"36":{"dur":1,"text":"which make us ill,"},"37":{"dur":3,"text":"and move far back in time\nto our Palaeolithic ancestors,"},"40":{"dur":2,"text":"more than 10,000 years ago,\nand eat like them."},"43":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, I'm really interested in this idea"},"46":{"dur":3,"text":"because it purports to put\narchaeology in action,"},"49":{"dur":2,"text":"to take information we know about the past"},"51":{"dur":3,"text":"and use it in the present\nto help us today."},"54":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, this idea was really started\nin the 1970s"},"57":{"dur":2,"text":"with this book, \"The Stone Age Diet.\""},"60":{"dur":2,"text":"It's diversified since then\ninto several variants,"},"63":{"dur":2,"text":"including the Paleo Diet,\nthe Primal Blueprint,"},"66":{"dur":2,"text":"the New Evolution Diet, and Neanderthin,"},"68":{"dur":5,"text":"and most of the language of these diets\nmakes references to anthropology,"},"74":{"dur":3,"text":"nutrition science,\nand evolutionary medicine."},"78":{"dur":2,"text":"The diet does seem\nprimarily targeted at men,"},"81":{"dur":2,"text":"so if you look at advertisements\nand descriptions,"},"84":{"dur":3,"text":"they have virile, cavemen-like images,"},"87":{"dur":4,"text":"things like \"live primal,\"\nlots of red meat."},"92":{"dur":7,"text":"And basically, the idea behind it\ncan be broken down into four parts."},"100":{"dur":4,"text":"One is that our agricultural diets today\nmake us chronically ill,"},"104":{"dur":2,"text":"that they are out of sync\nwith our biology."},"107":{"dur":4,"text":"And two, that we need\nto abandon these agricultural diets"},"112":{"dur":2,"text":"that started\nduring the agricultural period,"},"114":{"dur":2,"text":"and move back in time to the Palaeolithic"},"117":{"dur":4,"text":"and eat more like our ancestors\nover 10,000 years ago."},"122":{"dur":2,"text":"Third, that we know\nwhat these diets were like,"},"125":{"dur":4,"text":"and what they were like was they had a lot\nof meat, they were mainly meat based."},"129":{"dur":3,"text":"That was supplemented with vegetables\nand fruits and some nuts and oils,"},"133":{"dur":5,"text":"but it definitely did not contain\ngrains or legumes or

to talk to you about today\nis that this version of the Paleo Diet"},"151":{"dur":4,"text":"that's promoted in popular books,\non TV, on self-help websites"},"155":{"dur":6,"text":"and in the

there;\nI will explain."},"168":{"dur":3,"text":"So what I want to do\nas an archaeologist is go through this,"},"171":{"dur":1,"text":"do a bit of myth-busting"},"173":{"dur":2,"text":"of some of these\nfoundational archaeological concepts"},"175":{"dur":1,"text":"upon which it's based,"},"177":{"dur":2,"text":"and then I want to talk to you\nabout what we really do know"},"180":{"dur":1,"text":"from the archaeological record"},"182":{"dur":4,"text":"and from scientific studies\nabout what Palaeolithic people did eat."},"186":{"dur":2,"text":"So, myth one is that humans\nare evolved to eat meat"},"189":{"dur":5,"text":"and that Palaeolithic peoples\nconsumed large quantities of meat."},"194":{"dur":3,"text":"Humans have no known\nanatomical, physiological,"},"198":{"dur":2,"text":"or genetic adaptations\nto meat consumption."},"200":{"dur":3,"text":"Quite the opposite, we have\nmany adaptations to plant consumption."},"204":{"dur":2,"text":"Take, for example, vitamin C."},"206":{"dur":5,"text":"Carnivores can make their own vitamin C,\nbecause vitamin C is found in plants."},"212":{"dur":2,"text":"If you don't eat plants,\nyou need to make it yourself."},"215":{"dur":4,"text":"We can't make it, we have\nto consume it from plants."},"219":{"dur":3,"text":"We have a longer digestive tract\nthan carnivores."},"222":{"dur":3,"text":"That's because our food\nneeds to stay in our bodies longer,"},"225":{"dur":2,"text":"so we have more time\nto digest plant matter."},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"We need more surface area,\nwe need more microbes."},"231":{"dur":2,"text":"We have generalist dentition,"},"233":{"dur":4,"text":"so we have big molars that are there\nto shred fibrous plant tissue."},"238":{"dur":1,"text":"We do not have carnassials,"},"239":{"dur":4,"text":"which are the specialised teeth\nthat carnivores have to shred meat,"},"244":{"dur":4,"text":"and we do actually have\nsome genetic mutations in some populations"},"248":{"dur":5,"text":"that are adaptive to animal consumption,\nbut it's to milk, not meat,"},"253":{"dur":3,"text":"and these arose in certain populations\nduring agricultural periods"},"257":{"dur":2,"text":"primarily in Europe and Africa."},"263":{"dur":3,"text":"I call this \"The Meat Myth.\""},"266":{"dur":2,"text":"The idea behind it\nis that we should eat all this red meat,"},"269":{"dur":1,"text":"but that's just really not true."},"270":{"dur":1,"text":"The meats on this plate of meat here"},"272":{"dur":2,"text":"are from fattened cattle,\nthese are domestic animals."},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"Anything a Palaeolithic\nperson would have eaten"},"277":{"dur":2,"text":"would have probably been very lean,\nprobably small,"},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"and they wouldn't really\nhave eaten that much meat."},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"Of course there's also\nbone marrow and organs,"},"285":{"dur":1,"text":"these would have been very important."},"287":{"dur":3,"text":"We see evidence of harvesting\nof bone marrow in faunal assembles"},"290":{"dur":2,"text":"where you see characteristic\ncutting open of the bones,"},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"like you see here, for marrow extraction."},"295":{"dur":1,"text":"Now sure, people did eat meat,"},"297":{"dur":1,"text":"and especially in the Arctic"},"299":{"dur":3,"text":"and areas with long periods\nwhere plants were not available,"},"302":{"dur":1,"text":"they would have eaten a lot of meat."},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"But people that lived\nin more temperate or tropical regions"},"306":{"dur":3,"text":"would have had a very large\nplant portion of their diet."},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"So where does this Meat Myth come from?"},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"There's really two places,"},"314":{"dur":3,"text":"and one is the inherent bias\nin the archaeological record."},"318":{"dur":4,"text":"Bone is 80% mineral by weight,\nit's going to preserve better and longer"},"322":{"dur":3,"text":"over thousands of years\nthan delicate plant remains."},"325":{"dur":3,"text":"But the other issue comes\nfrom some early bone biochemistry studies"},"329":{"dur":4,"text":"that were performed\non Neanderthals and early people."},"335":{"dur":1,"text":"This bone biochemistry study"},"337":{"dur":3,"text":"is based on something called\nnitrogen stable isotope analysis."},"340":{"dur":2,"text":"It's complicated, but I'm going\nto try and break it down."},"343":{"dur":4,"text":"The basic idea is that you are\nwhat you eat, and so we -"},"347":{"dur":5,"text":"there's nitrogen-15 and nitrogen-14,\nheavy and light versions of nitrogen -"},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"and we consume this nitrogen in our food."},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"But there's one important difference,"},"357":{"dur":3,"text":"and that is, with each step\nthat you go up the trophic hierarchy,"},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"the amount of the heavier\nisotope increases."},"364":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you measure\nthe amount of heavy isotope in the bone,"},"367":{"dur":4,"text":"you can infer where that individual\nwas on a food chain."},"372":{"dur":4,"text":"This is an example\nof a generalized isotopic model."},"376":{"dur":3,"text":"I've plotted where plants generally fall,\nand above them are the herbivores,"},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"and then above them, the carnivores."},"382":{"dur":4,"text":"But one of the problems is that not all\necosystems conform to this model."},"387":{"dur":3,"text":"There's a lot of regional variability,\nso if you don't understand the region,"},"391":{"dur":3,"text":"you can come to erroneous conclusions.\nI'll give you some examples:"},"394":{"dur":5,"text":"we can take East Africa;\nif we measure animals and ancient humans,"},"400":{"dur":3,"text":"in East Africa, we see\nsome very strange patterns."},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"First of all, how can a human\nbe higher than a lion?"},"406":{"dur":5,"text":"Lions only eat other animals. And then,\nhow is this herbivore above a lion?"},"411":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, it turns out\nthat the food that you eat is not"},"415":{"dur":3,"text":"is not the only contributor\nto these isotopic values."},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"and that aridity can also have an impact."},"421":{"dur":3,"text":"So what we're likely seeing here\nis differences in water access."},"425":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's move out of the savannah\nand move into the tropical areas."},"428":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's look at the ancient Maya;\nagain we see something anomalous."},"431":{"dur":3,"text":"We see the ancient Maya\nlining up with jaguars."},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, we know the ancient Maya\nhad a diet heavily reliant on corn."},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"So what's happening here?"},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"We don't exactly know,\nbut we think this may have to do with"},"443":{"dur":5,"text":"the way they performed agriculture\nand how they fertilised their crops."},"448":{"dur":1,"text":"Now let's go to the Pleistocene."},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"We see some\nreally interesting patterns here too."},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"We see reindeer plotting very low,\nin the range of plants."},"455":{"dur":3,"text":"We see wolves plotting normally\nwhere you would see herbivores,"},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"and we see mammoths\nspanning all three levels,"},"461":{"dur":3,"text":"at once plants, herbivores and carnivores."},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"So what we think is happening here"},"466":{"dur":4,"text":"is that in very cold climates,\nanimals eat unusual things."},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"and in this case\nwhat we think is happening"},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"is these mammoths\nare eating lichens and bark"},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's giving them\nvery strange values."},"478":{"dur":4,"text":"So if we now go to humans, ancient humans,\nPalaeolithic humans, and Neanderthals,"},"482":{"dur":6,"text":"we see that they plot in the same\nisotopic space as wolves and hyenas."},"488":{"dur":4,"text":"Now that's true, but as I've shown,\nif you don't have good control"},"493":{"dur":4,"text":"over the regional isotopic ecology,\nyou can come to an erroneous conclusion,"},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"and I think it's premature to say"},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"this is very strong evidence\nof meat consumption,"},"501":{"dur":4,"text":"given how very little we really know\nabout the Palaeolithic ecosystems."},"507":{"dur":5,"text":"So, myth two is that Palaeolithic peoples\ndid not eat whole grains or legumes."},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, we have stone tool evidence\nfrom at least 30,000 years ago -"},"517":{"dur":3,"text":"that's 20,000 years\nbefore the invention of agriculture -"},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"of people using stone tools"},"522":{"dur":4,"text":"that look like mortars and pestles\nto grind up seeds and grain."},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"More recently\nwe've been developing techniques"},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"where we can actually measure\nthis thing called \"dental calculus.\""},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"It's very interesting:\nit's fossilized dental plaque."},"535":{"dur":3,"text":"We can go in the individual mouths\nof people, pull out that plaque"},"538":{"dur":3,"text":"and recover microfossils\nof plants and other remains."},"542":{"dur":4,"text":"My team is working on developing\nmethods to extract DNA and proteins,"},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"and other research groups\nare focussing on these microfossils"},"549":{"dur":3,"text":"like starch grains, pollen and phytoliths."},"553":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, we're still in early days here,"},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"but even with the limited\nresearch we have,"},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"we can say that there is an abundance\nof plant remains"},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"inside the dental calculus\nof Paleolithic peoples."},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"And these things include\ngrains, including barley."},"566":{"dur":4,"text":"We're finding barley inside\nNeanderthal teeth, or inside the plaque."},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"We also have legumes and tubers."},"574":{"dur":5,"text":"So, myth three is that Paleo Diet foods,\nin the fad diet,"},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"are what our Palaeolithic ancestors ate."},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"That's just not true."},"585":{"dur":4,"text":"Every single food that's pictured\nin these advertisements"},"589":{"dur":5,"text":"are all domesticated foods,\nproducts of farming, of agriculture."},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"They're from the Neolithic transition."},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's give an example - bananas."},"600":{"dur":1,"text":"Bananas are the ultimate farmer's food."},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"They can't reproduce in the wild anymore."},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"We've bred out their ability\nto make seeds."},"607":{"dur":1,"text":"So every banana you've ever eaten"},"609":{"dur":4,"text":"is a genetic clone of every other banana,\ngrown from cuttings."},"613":{"dur":3,"text":"They're definitely a farmer's food."},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"If you were to eat a wild banana,\nit is so full of seeds"},"619":{"dur":4,"text":"that I bet many people in this room\nwouldn't even recognize it as edible."},"624":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's take salads, that seems\nlike a really great Paleo Diet food."},"628":{"dur":3,"text":"Except that we've radically changed\nthe ingredients to suit our needs."},"632":{"dur":3,"text":"So, wild lettuces contain\na great deal of latex,"},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"which is indigestible\nand irritates our gastrointestinal system."},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"It's bitter, the leaves are tough."},"642":{"dur":3,"text":"We've domesticated them\nto be softer, to produce bigger leaves,"},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"to remove the latex and the bitterness,"},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"remove the spines that grow on the leaves"},"649":{"dur":3,"text":"and stems of wild varieties,\nmake them tastier for us."},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"The tomato that's shown here"},"655":{"dur":4,"text":"lacks the tomatine and solanine toxins\nthat are present in its wild relatives,"},"659":{"dur":3,"text":"which are all members\nof the poisonous nightshade family."},"662":{"dur":4,"text":"If we look at oil, it's true that olive\noil is the only natural vegetable oil"},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"that can be harvested\nwithout synthetic chemicals."},"670":{"dur":3,"text":"Except, it still requires at least\nrudimentary presses to remove it,"},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"something that no Palaeolithic person\nwould have ever built."},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"This is a farmer's food."},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"This is a model diet I found on a website."},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"It looks like a delicious\nand nutritious breakfast,"},"685":{"dur":3,"text":"but a Palaeolithic person\nwouldn't have had access to it."},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"First of all, the blueberries\nare from New England,"},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"the avocados, from Mexico,\nand the eggs, from China."},"693":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"694":{"dur":4,"text":"This would have\nnever appeared on any Palaeolithic plate."},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"And last, we have this problem of size."},"701":{"dur":3,"text":"Domestic blueberries\nare twice the size of wild blueberries."},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"We've already talked\nabout bananas; you look at avocados."},"708":{"dur":3,"text":"A wild avocado has maybe\na couple millimetres of fruit on it,"},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"and the same goes for wild olives."},"715":{"dur":3,"text":"And of course chickens, chickens\nare prolific producers."},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"They lay eggs almost every single day."},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"They're predictable, large and abundant."},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"If you're trying to collect\nwild eggs, they don't lay year round,"},"727":{"dur":3,"text":"and they're not as easy to find,\nthey're typically small."},"730":{"dur":1,"text":"But maybe you're not convinced,"},"732":{"dur":3,"text":"so I'm going to give\njust a couple more examples."},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"This, you may all recognise as broccoli."},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"Broccoli did not even exist\nin the Palaeolithic period."},"741":{"dur":4,"text":"What you see on the left\nis wild broccoli - looks quite different."},"745":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, wild broccoli is also:\nwild cabbage, wild cauliflower, wild kale,"},"751":{"dur":4,"text":"wild kohlrabi and wild Brussels sprouts,\nthey're all the same species."},"755":{"dur":2,"text":"The only difference is they're\ndifferent cultivars."},"757":{"dur":2,"text":"We've selectively bred the same species"},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"to produce the kind of food\nthat we like best."},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"These are human inventions."},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"Broccoli, I think, is an interesting\nexample because it's this weird thing."},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"What even is broccoli?"},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"It's such a strange looking vegetable."},"772":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"773":{"dur":3,"text":"In case you don't know, it's flowers,\nthe flower of the plant."},"777":{"dur":3,"text":"We've changed this wild plant"},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"into something that produces\nso many dense flowers."},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"It produces this odd,\nstalk-like thing, but it is flowers."},"786":{"dur":3,"text":"If you don't believe me,\nbuy some broccoli at your grocery store,"},"789":{"dur":3,"text":"put it in a vase, like I did\non the right, and it will bloom."},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"It makes a lovely, lovely bouquet."},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"796":{"dur":1,"text":"So let's talk about carrots next."},"798":{"dur":2,"text":"You all recognise the carrots\non the right,"},"800":{"dur":2,"text":"but wild carrot is what's on the left."},"803":{"dur":3,"text":"It contains falcarindiol and other\nthings that are natural pesticides."},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"They're bitter in flavour\nand they taste really bad,"},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"and we've bred them out\nand we've also expanded them"},"812":{"dur":3,"text":"made them much bigger, much sweeter,\nand much more full of vitamins,"},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"because that's what we want."},"819":{"dur":1,"text":"Many of you may not know this,"},"820":{"dur":1,"text":"but almonds and apricots"},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"are extremely closely related\nspecies of prune."},"825":{"dur":3,"text":"The main difference is that\nwe've bred out the cyanide in almonds,"},"828":{"dur":1,"text":"so that we can eat the seed,"},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"and we have selected for bigger,\nthicker fruits in apricots,"},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"because that's what we want\nto eat from that particular species."},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"They're very closely related and,\nlike carrots and broccoli,"},"839":{"dur":4,"text":"they are essentially human inventions."},"843":{"dur":2,"text":"So let's talk about some real Paleo diets."},"845":{"dur":3,"text":"First of all, I need to clarify\nthat there is no one Paleo diet."},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"There are many, many Paleo diets."},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"People, when they spread out\nacross the world,"},"854":{"dur":1,"text":"colonised the continents,"},"855":{"dur":3,"text":"they ate local foods, and of course\nthey were extremely variable."},"859":{"dur":3,"text":"So when we speak about Palaeolithic diets,"},"862":{"dur":2,"text":"it's very important\nto speak of them in the plural."},"865":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's take a closer look\nat one in particular;"},"867":{"dur":3,"text":"we're going to go 7,000 years\nback in time to Oaxaca, Mexico,"},"871":{"dur":3,"text":"and right now you're looking at the view\noutside of the Guil\u00e1 Naquitz rock shelter,"},"875":{"dur":2,"text":"one of the earliest sites in Mexico."},"878":{"dur":3,"text":"This is a photograph\nthat I took in December,"},"882":{"dur":3,"text":"and people would have\nbeen living here at this time,"},"885":{"dur":3,"text":"and what you are essentially\nseeing right now is dinner."},"889":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is a far cry from anything\nthat you would find on the Paleo Diet"},"893":{"dur":3,"text":"and anything you would find\nin your modern supermarket."},"896":{"dur":3,"text":"But, there was plenty of food here\nfor people to eat on a seasonal basis."},"900":{"dur":2,"text":"So, September was high time\nat Guil\u00e1 Naquitz."},"903":{"dur":2,"text":"This is when a lot of people\nwould have come in"},"905":{"dur":1,"text":"and occupied these rock shelters,"},"907":{"dur":2,"text":"and they would have eaten\nthe local resources."},"909":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you notice,\nthis includes a lot of fruit,"},"912":{"dur":3,"text":"legumes, agaves,\nthat's what we make tequila from today."},"915":{"dur":6,"text":"Various nuts and beans and squashes\nand wild game, predominantly rabbits."},"922":{"dur":1,"text":"But by the time April came around,"},"924":{"dur":2,"text":"there was very little\nedible food in this region"},"926":{"dur":4,"text":"so they would have moved on to other\nplaces where food was more abundant."},"931":{"dur":1,"text":"So if we take a step back and say,"},"933":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Well, what can we really learn"},"935":{"dur":2,"text":"about the Palaeolithic diets\naround the world?\""},"937":{"dur":3,"text":"There are some general\nobservations we can make."},"941":{"dur":2,"text":"One is that they are regionally variable."},"943":{"dur":2,"text":"People in the Arctic have\nand will eat something different"},"946":{"dur":1,"text":"than people in the tropics."},"947":{"dur":1,"text":"They have different resources."},"949":{"dur":3,"text":"So people who live in places\nwith no plants tend to eat more animals,"},"953":{"dur":2,"text":"and people who live in places\nwhere there are plants"},"955":{"dur":1,"text":"tend to eat more plants."},"957":{"dur":1,"text":"They're going to be seasonally variable,"},"959":{"dur":2,"text":"because plants seed and fruit\nat different times,"},"961":{"dur":3,"text":"herds migrate and fish\nspawn on a seasonal cycle."},"966":{"dur":1,"text":"As these things happen,"},"967":{"dur":2,"text":"people have to move\nfrom resource patch to resource patch,"},"970":{"dur":4,"text":"which means that there is periodic high\nmobility, sometimes over long distances."},"974":{"dur":2,"text":"Once again, it depends on the region."},"977":{"dur":2,"text":"Food packets were generally small;"},"979":{"dur":2,"text":"if you go around collecting wild broccoli,"},"981":{"dur":2,"text":"you'll have to collect an awful lot of it"},"984":{"dur":2,"text":"to be the equivalent\nof its domesticated variety."},"986":{"dur":1,"text":"The foods that you would have collected"},"988":{"dur":3,"text":"would have been\ngenerally tough, woody and fibrous."},"992":{"dur":3,"text":"You would eat meat, but you would\nalso eat the marrow and the organs"},"995":{"dur":3,"text":"of the animals you collect,\nand they'd generally be very lean."},"999":{"dur":1,"text":"Finally, the plants you'd eat"},"1000":{"dur":3,"text":"would still contain a lot of toxins\nat various levels,"},"1003":{"dur":3,"text":"and phytochemicals, some of which\nactually have very good health benefits."},"1008":{"dur":4,"text":"But it's almost impossible\nfor us now to eat this sort of diet."},"1012":{"dur":3,"text":"Three billion people cannot eat\nlike foragers on this planet,"},"1016":{"dur":2,"text":"we are too big."},"1018":{"dur":2,"text":"So, can we take lessons\nfrom these Palaeolithic diets"},"1021":{"dur":2,"text":"that we still can apply\nto our lives today?"},"1023":{"dur":2,"text":"And the answer is, 'yes.'"},"1026":{"dur":2,"text":"I think there's three main\nlessons we can learn:"},"1029":{"dur":3,"text":"First, there's no one correct diet,\nbut diversity is the key."},"1033":{"dur":2,"text":"So, depending on where you live,"},"1035":{"dur":3,"text":"you can eat very different things,\nbut you need diversity."},"1038":{"dur":3,"text":"We lack the ability to synthesise\nmany nutrients that we require for life,"},"1042":{"dur":1,"text":"nutrients and vitamins,"},"1044":{"dur":2,"text":"and we are required\nto get them from our foods."},"1046":{"dur":4,"text":"Eating a diet that's rich in species,\nhas high species diversity"},"1050":{"dur":1,"text":"is very
