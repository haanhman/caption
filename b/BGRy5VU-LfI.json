--"},"80":{"dur":2,"text":"this old technology."},"83":{"dur":2,"text":"So let's start with the obvious:"},"85":{"dur":3,"text":"Many of us don't like the needle and syringe."},"89":{"dur":1,"text":"I share that view."},"91":{"dur":3,"text":"However, 20 percent of the population"},"94":{"dur":2,"text":"have a thing called needle phobia."},"96":{"dur":1,"text":"That's more than disliking the

the needle."},"183":{"dur":2,"text":"And I've designed those projections"},"186":{"dur":4,"text":"to serve a key role, which is to \nwork with the skin's immune system."},"190":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's a very important function"},"192":{"dur":1,"text":"tied in with the Nanopatch."},"194":{"dur":2,"text":"Now we make the Nanopatch"},"196":{"dur":2,"text":"with a technique"},"199":{"dur":2,"text":"called deep reactive ion etching."},"201":{"dur":2,"text":"And this particular technique \nis one that's been borrowed"},"203":{"dur":1,"text":"from the semiconductor industry,"},"205":{"dur":1,"text":"and therefore is low cost"},"207":{"dur":2,"text":"and can be rolled out in large numbers."},"209":{"dur":5,"text":"Now we dry-coat vaccines to \nthe projections of the Nanopatch"},"214":{"dur":1,"text":"and apply it to the skin."},"216":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, the simplest form of application"},"220":{"dur":2,"text":"is using our finger,"},"222":{"dur":2,"text":"but our finger has some limitations,"},"225":{"dur":2,"text":"so we've devised an applicator."},"227":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's a very simple device --"},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"you could call it a sophisticated finger."},"231":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a spring-operated device."},"234":{"dur":3,"text":"What we do is when we apply \nthe Nanopatch to the skin as so --"},"237":{"dur":1,"text":"(Click) --"},"239":{"dur":2,"text":"immediately a few things happen."},"242":{"dur":4,"text":"So firstly, the projections on the Nanopatch"},"246":{"dur":1,"text":"breach through the tough outer layer"},"248":{"dur":2,"text":"and the vaccine is very quickly released --"},"250":{"dur":2,"text":"within less than a minute, in fact."},"252":{"dur":2,"text":"Then we can take the Nanopatch off"},"255":{"dur":1,"text":"and discard it."},"257":{"dur":5,"text":"And indeed we can make \na reuse of the applicator itself."},"263":{"dur":2,"text":"So that gives you an idea of the Nanopatch,"},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"and immediately you can see some key advantages."},"268":{"dur":1,"text":"We've talked about it being needle-free --"},"270":{"dur":2,"text":"these are projections that you can't even see --"},"272":{"dur":1,"text":"and, of course, we get around"},"274":{"dur":3,"text":"the needle phobia issue as well."},"277":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, if we take a step back and think about"},"279":{"dur":3,"text":"these other two really important advantages:"},"282":{"dur":4,"text":"One is improved immune \nresponses through delivery,"},"286":{"dur":3,"text":"and the second is getting rid of the cold chain."},"290":{"dur":2,"text":"So let's start with the first one, \nthis immunogenicity idea."},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"It takes a little while to get our heads around,"},"294":{"dur":3,"text":"but I'll try to explain it in simple terms."},"298":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'll take a step back and explain to you"},"300":{"dur":3,"text":"how vaccines work in a simple way."},"303":{"dur":2,"text":"So vaccines work by introducing into our body"},"306":{"dur":2,"text":"a thing called an antigen"},"308":{"dur":3,"text":"which is a safe form of a germ."},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"Now that safe germ, that antigen,"},"313":{"dur":3,"text":"tricks our body into mounting an immune response,"},"317":{"dur":4,"text":"learning and remembering \nhow to deal with intruders."},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"When the real intruder comes along"},"323":{"dur":1,"text":"the body quickly mounts an immune response"},"325":{"dur":1,"text":"to deal with that vaccine"},"327":{"dur":1,"text":"and neutralizes the infection."},"328":{"dur":1,"text":"So it does that well."},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, the way it's done today \nwith the needle and syringe,"},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"most vaccines are delivered that way --"},"335":{"dur":1,"text":"with this old technology and the needle."},"337":{"dur":5,"text":"But it could be argued that the needle \nis holding back our immune responses;"},"342":{"dur":3,"text":"it's missing our immune sweet spot in the skin."},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"To describe this idea,"},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"we need to take a journey through the skin,"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"starting with one of those projections"},"353":{"dur":2,"text":"and applying the Nanopatch to the skin."},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"And we see this kind of data."},"358":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, this is real data --"},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"that thing that we can see there is one projection"},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"from the Nanopatch that's been applied to the skin"},"365":{"dur":1,"text":"and those colors are different layers."},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, to give you an idea of scale,"},"368":{"dur":1,"text":"if the needle was shown here, it would be too big."},"370":{"dur":1,"text":"It would be 10 times bigger"},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"than the size of that screen,\ngoing 10 times deeper as well."},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"It's off the grid entirely."},"377":{"dur":3,"text":"You can see immediately that we \nhave those projections in the skin."},"380":{"dur":3,"text":"That red layer is a tough outer layer of dead skin,"},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"but the brown layer and the magenta layer"},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"are jammed full of immune cells."},"389":{"dur":1,"text":"As one example, in the brown layer"},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"there's a certain type of cell \ncalled a Langerhans cell --"},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"every square millimeter of our body"},"395":{"dur":3,"text":"is jammed full of those Langerhans cells,"},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"those immune cells, and \nthere's others shown as well"},"400":{"dur":1,"text":"that we haven't stained in this image."},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"But you can immediately see that the Nanopatch"},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"achieves that penetration indeed."},"406":{"dur":3,"text":"We target thousands upon thousands \nof these particular cells"},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"just residing within a hair's width"},"412":{"dur":3,"text":"of the surface of the skin."},"415":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, as the guy that's invented\nthis thing and designed it to do that,"},"419":{"dur":3,"text":"I found that exciting. But so what?"},"422":{"dur":1,"text":"So what if you've targeted cells?"},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"In the world of vaccines, what does that mean?"},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"The world of vaccines is getting better."},"429":{"dur":1,"text":"It's getting more systematic."},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"However, you still don't really know"},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"if a vaccine is going to work"},"435":{"dur":1,"text":"until you roll your sleeves up"},"436":{"dur":2,"text":"and vaccinate and wait."},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a gambler's game even today."},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"So, we had to do that gamble."},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"We obtained an influenza vaccine,"},"446":{"dur":1,"text":"we applied it to our Nanopatches"},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"and we applied the Nanopatches to the skin,"},"450":{"dur":1,"text":"and we waited --"},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"and this is in the live animal."},"454":{"dur":1,"text":"We waited a month,"},"456":{"dur":1,"text":"and this is what we found out."},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"This is a data slide showing the immune responses"},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"that we've generated with a Nanopatch"},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"compared to the needle and syringe into muscle."},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"So on the horizontal axis we have \nthe dose shown in nanograms."},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"On the vertical axis we have \nthe immune response generated,"},"472":{"dur":5,"text":"and that dashed line indicates \nthe protection threshold."},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"If we're above that line it's considered protective;"},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"if we're below that line it's not."},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"So the red line is mostly below that curve"},"486":{"dur":3,"text":"and indeed there's only one point that \nis achieved with the needle that's protective,"},"489":{"dur":3,"text":"and that's with a high dose of 6,000 nanograms."},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"But notice immediately the distinctly different curve"},"495":{"dur":3,"text":"that we achieve with the blue line."},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"That's what's achieved with the Nanopatch;"},"500":{"dur":1,"text":"the delivered dose of the Nanopatch is"},"502":{"dur":3,"text":"a completely different immunogenicity curve."},"505":{"dur":1,"text":"That's a real fresh opportunity."},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"Suddenly we have a brand new lever"},"509":{"dur":1,"text":"in the world of vaccines."},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"We can push it one way,"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"where we can take a vaccine \nthat works but is too expensive"},"515":{"dur":1,"text":"and can get protection"},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"with a hundredth of the dose \ncompared to the needle."},"519":{"dur":4,"text":"That can take a vaccine that's suddenly \n10 dollars down to 10 cents,"},"523":{"dur":3,"text":"and that's particularly important \nwithin the developing world."},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"But there's another angle to this as well --"},"528":{"dur":3,"text":"you can take vaccines that currently don't work"},"531":{"dur":1,"text":"and get them over that line"},"533":{"dur":1,"text":"and get them protective."},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"And certainly in the world of vaccines"},"537":{"dur":1,"text":"that can be important."},"538":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's consider the big three:"},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"HIV, malaria, tuberculosis."},"542":{"dur":2,"text":"They're responsible for about \n7 million deaths per year,"},"545":{"dur":3,"text":"and there is no adequate vaccination \nmethod for any of those."},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"So potentially, with this new lever \nthat we have with the Nanopatch,"},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"we can help make that happen."},"552":{"dur":4,"text":"We can push that lever to help get those \ncandidate vaccines over the line."},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, of course, we've worked within my lab"},"559":{"dur":1,"text":"with many other vaccines that have attained"},"561":{"dur":2,"text":"similar responses and similar curves to this,"},"564":{"dur":3,"text":"what we've achieved with influenza."},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"I'd like to now switch to talk about"},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"another key shortcoming of today's vaccines,"},"573":{"dur":3,"text":"and that is the need to maintain the cold chain."},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"As the name suggests -- the cold chain --"},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"it's the requirements of keeping \na vaccine right from production"},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"all the way through to when the vaccine is applied,"},"585":{"dur":3,"text":"to keep it refrigerated."},"588":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, that presents some logistical challenges"},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"but we have ways to do it."},"594":{"dur":4,"text":"This is a slightly extreme case in point"},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"but it helps illustrate the logistical challenges,"},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"in particular in resource-poor settings,"},"603":{"dur":3,"text":"of what's required to get vaccines"},"607":{"dur":1,"text":"refrigerated and maintain the cold chain."},"608":{"dur":3,"text":"If the vaccine is too warm the vaccine breaks down,"},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"but interestingly it can be too cold"},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"and the vaccine can break down as well."},"617":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, the stakes are very high."},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"The WHO estimates that within Africa,"},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"up to half the vaccines used there"},"626":{"dur":1,"text":"are considered to not be working properly"},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"because at some point the \ncold chain has fallen over."},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's a big problem, and it's tied \nin with the needle and syringe"},"633":{"dur":5,"text":"because it's a liquid form vaccine, and \nwhen it's liquid it needs the refrigeration."},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"A key attribute of our Nanopatch"},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"is that the vaccine is dry,"},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"and when it's dry it doesn't need refrigeration."},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"Within my lab we've shown that we can keep"},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"the vaccine stored at 23 degrees Celsius"},"651":{"dur":3,"text":"for more than a year without \nany loss in activity at all."},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"That's an important improvement."},"657":{"dur":6,"text":"(Applause)"},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"We're delighted about it as well."},"666":{"dur":4,"text":"And the thing about it is that\nwe have well and truly proven"},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"the Nanopatch within the laboratory setting."},"673":{"dur":3,"text":"And as a

being,"},"683":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not going to be satisfied"},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"until we've rolled this thing \nout, taken it out of the lab"},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"and got it to people in large numbers"},"689":{"dur":3,"text":"and particularly the people that need it the most."},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"So we've commenced this particular journey,"},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"and we've commenced this \njourney in an unusual way."},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"We've started with Papua New Guinea."},"701":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, Papua New Guinea is an example \nof a developing world country."},"707":{"dur":3,"text":"It's about the same size as France,"},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"but it suffers from many of the key barriers"},"713":{"dur":4,"text":"existing within the world of today's vaccines."},"717":{"dur":1,"text":"There's the logistics:"},"719":{"dur":4,"text":"Within this country there are only 800 \nrefrigerators to keep vaccines chilled."},"723":{"dur":4,"text":"Many of them are old, like this one in Port Moresby,\nmany of them are breaking down"},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"and many are not in the Highlands \nwhere they are required."},"730":{"dur":1,"text":"That's a challenge."},"732":{"dur":5,"text":"But also, Papua New Guinea has the \nworld's highest incidence of HPV,"},"737":{"dur":4,"text":"human papillomavirus, the \ncervical cancer [risk factor]."},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"Yet, that vaccine is not available in large numbers"},"744":{"dur":1,"text":"because it's too expensive."},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"So for those two reasons, with \nthe attributes of the Nanopatch,"},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"we've got into the field and \nworked with the Nanopatch,"},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"and taken it to Papua New Guinea"},"754":{"dur":3,"text":"and we'll be following that up shortly."},"758":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, doing this kind of work is not easy."},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"It's challenging,"},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"but there's nothing else in \nthe world I'd rather be doing."},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"And as we look ahead"},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"I'd like to share with you a
