ourselves"},"316":{"dur":1,"text":"and our own trustworthiness?"},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"The second is can\nwe actually detect"},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"whether somebody else is\ngoing to be trustworthy?"},"323":{"dur":1,"text":"In some ways, this has\nbeen the holy grail"},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"of governmental research\nand security research."},"328":{"dur":1,"text":"And we've been pretty bad at it."},"329":{"dur":1,"text":"But I have some new\ndata I want to share"},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"with you that\nsuggests we can do it."},"333":{"dur":1,"text":"And then finally, the\nquestion that's probably"},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"closest to my heart in the\nwork that I normally do,"},"337":{"dur":3,"text":"which is, how can we increase\ntrustworthiness and thereby"},"340":{"dur":3,"text":"increase our own and each\nother's resilience around us?"},"344":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's start with\nthe first question."},"348":{"dur":1,"text":"Most of us, when we\nthink about trust,"},"349":{"dur":3,"text":"we think about it as\nthis stable trait."},"353":{"dur":3,"text":"A person's trustworthy\nor they're not."},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"But I want to convince\nyou that that's probably"},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"not the best way\nto think about it."},"361":{"dur":1,"text":"That's not how it really works."},"363":{"dur":3,"text":"Growing up, we have this idea\nthat it's a typical motif,"},"366":{"dur":0,"text":"right?"},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"You see it in\ncartoons all the time."},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"There's an angel on one shoulder\nand a devil on the other,"},"371":{"dur":1,"text":"and they whisper into your ears."},"372":{"dur":1,"text":"And if you grow up\nlistening to the angel,"},"374":{"dur":1,"text":"well then you're going\nto be a good person."},"376":{"dur":0,"text":"You're going to be trustworthy."},"377":{"dur":0,"text":"Everybody is going to love you."},"378":{"dur":1,"text":"Everything's going to be good."},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"There's just one\nproblem with that."},"382":{"dur":4,"text":"And that is if you actually\nlook at the scientific data,"},"387":{"dur":1,"text":"it doesn't really hold up."},"388":{"dur":2,"text":"What we've learned over\nthe past decade especially"},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"in psychological science is\nthat people's moral behavior"},"393":{"dur":3,"text":"is a lot more variable than\nany of us would have expected."},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's a lot more\ninfluenced by the situation."},"399":{"dur":1,"text":"And so if you want to\ncontrol your own behavior"},"401":{"dur":1,"text":"and predict the behavior\nof those around you,"},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"you need to realize that\nit's not a stable trait."},"405":{"dur":3,"text":"You need to understand how\nit's affected by the situation."},"409":{"dur":4,"text":"And so my model for\nunderstanding trustworthiness,"},"413":{"dur":3,"text":"it's better to think of it\nas a scale, the old school"},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"type of type with\nthe plates that go up"},"418":{"dur":1,"text":"and down as opposed\nto a digital one."},"420":{"dur":3,"text":"In any one moment, your mind,\nwhether you know it or not,"},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"is weighing two types of cost."},"426":{"dur":3,"text":"It's weighing costs and\nbenefits in the short term"},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"versus costs and benefits\nin the long term."},"432":{"dur":2,"text":"And those usually correlate\nwith what's good for me"},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"in an expedient fashion right\nnow versus what's good for me"},"438":{"dur":3,"text":"to do even if it costs me in\nthe moment to built a reputation"},"442":{"dur":3,"text":"and to build social\nbonds in the long term."},"445":{"dur":4,"text":"And depending upon the\nsituation, which decision you"},"449":{"dur":3,"text":"choose can change\nfrom moment to moment."},"452":{"dur":0,"text":"You can think about it."},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"If my friend Ming\nloans me money,"},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"in the moment if I don't pay\nhim back, well, I'm ahead."},"459":{"dur":1,"text":"I've profited in the short term."},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"But long term, it's\nprobably a poor decision"},"462":{"dur":1,"text":"because he's not going\nto give me money again."},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going to get a reputation\nas being a cheater."},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"But if I can get away\nwith it, my mind,"},"468":{"dur":3,"text":"unbeknownst to me and my own\nmoral codes that I endorse,"},"471":{"dur":4,"text":"will try to push me to\nbe a bit untrustworthy."},"475":{"dur":1,"text":"And so I want to\nsuggest to all of you"},"477":{"dur":1,"text":"who think this\ncan't happen to me"},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"and that you are\ncompletely honest"},"481":{"dur":3,"text":"and trustworthy and wonderful,\nit can happen to any of us."},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"And let me show you an\nexample of how it happens"},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"and also why you probably\ndon't think it's true of you"},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"even though it is."},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"So the first issue is how do\nyou study trustworthiness?"},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"I can't really walk around with\na clipboard and say, Cindy,"},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"are you a trustworthy person?"},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"Because what people will\nprobably say is they'll"},"501":{"dur":0,"text":"do one of two things."},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"Either they know they're\nnot and they'll, yes I am."},"504":{"dur":1,"text":"Because who wants\nto say I'm not?"},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"But what happens\nmore frequently is"},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"they think they are, and\nthey predict they will be,"},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"but when push comes to shove,\ntime and again our behavior"},"513":{"dur":1,"text":"isn't what we expect."},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"And so the way that we have to\nstudy trustworthiness is not"},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"by asking people or looking\nat their past reputations"},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"but by staging events\nin real time as opposed"},"524":{"dur":4,"text":"to fake time where we can\nactually see when push comes"},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"to shove, what will\npeople actually do"},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"when real rewards\nare on the line?"},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"So let me give you an\nexample of how we do this."},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"So we set up an experiment\nin our lab to look at this,"},"538":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's rather simple."},"540":{"dur":1,"text":"We bring people into the lab."},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"These are normal\ncommunity members"},"544":{"dur":3,"text":"or even undergraduates\nfrom the Boston community"},"547":{"dur":1,"text":"all known to be\ntrustworthy people."},"549":{"dur":1,"text":"We bring them in\nand say, look, we've"},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"got two tasks that\nneed to be done."},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"One is really long\nand onerous and it's"},"556":{"dur":4,"text":"these terrible logic\nproblems, and circling letters"},"561":{"dur":2,"text":"E, and random digit\nstrings, and all the things"},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"that you would feel like is\na big waste of your time."},"566":{"dur":5,"text":"Or you can do a fun photo\nhunt on the computer."},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"Here's a coin."},"573":{"dur":3,"text":"I want you to flip the coin,\nand whatever one you get,"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"it will determine whether you\ndo the photo hunt or the logic"},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"And whichever one you\ndon't do, the person"},"582":{"dur":3,"text":"sitting in the next\nroom is going to get."},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"And we're going to trust you\nto do this the right way."},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"They say sure."},"591":{"dur":1,"text":"And then we let them go."},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"What do you think happens?"},"596":{"dur":4,"text":"A lot of people just assign\nthemselves to the good task."},"600":{"dur":3,"text":"Any guesses for how many?"},"603":{"dur":1,"text":"80%?"},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"Close, 90%."},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"We've done this\nmany, many times."},"609":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's not a fluke finding."},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"We've done it in our lab."},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"Other people have\ncopied the methodology."},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"90% of people-- well\nthey do one other thing."},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"Some of them don't\nflip the coin and just"},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"say, oh, I got the good\ntask when they come out."},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"Or some of them, because we\nhave them on hidden video,"},"621":{"dur":3,"text":"flip the coin repeatedly until\nthey get the answer they want,"},"625":{"dur":1,"text":"which is the same as\nnot flipping at all."},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"But they feel better\nabout themselves."},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"And so these are people\nwho we asked them"},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"before, if you don't flip the\ncoin, is that untrustworthy?"},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"They said, oh, it would\nbe terribly untrustworthy."},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"But they do it."},"637":{"dur":1,"text":"And if you ask them\nwhen they come out,"},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"we have them rate on a\ncomputer how trustworthily they"},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"So here higher numbers\nmean higher trust"},"645":{"dur":1,"text":"on a one to seven scale."},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"So when they're judging\nthemselves doing this,"},"650":{"dur":1,"text":"they're above the midpoint."},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"So they say, yeah, it was OK."},"653":{"dur":1,"text":"I was trustworthy."},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"If you take those same\npeople and you now"},"657":{"dur":3,"text":"have them watch\nsomebody else do this,"},"660":{"dur":1,"text":"they condemn the person for it."},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"That person was not trustworthy."},"664":{"dur":1,"text":"When I did it, it was OK."},"665":{"dur":3,"text":"When that person did it, they're\ndefinitely not trustworthy."},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, the interesting\nthing about this"},"672":{"dur":4,"text":"is these were people\nwho are normal people."},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"And so when we see people\nlike Lance Armstrong or Bernie"},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"Madoff, you think, oh,\nit's something wrong."},"681":{"dur":4,"text":"Those people are morally\ncorrupt and untrustworthy."},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"No, well, yes what they\ndid was untrustworthy."},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"But the same process-- on\na smaller scale, of course,"},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"and we can only study on a\nsmaller scale in the lab--"},"694":{"dur":0,"text":"happens with us."},"695":{"dur":1,"text":"It happens with any of you."},"696":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, the question is, well,\nwhy don't we realize this?"},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"Why don't we learn to\nstop trusting ourselves?"},"702":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, the reason why is our mind\nwhitewashes our own behavior."},"707":{"dur":5,"text":"So if you ask these subjects,\nwhy did you not flip the coin?"},"712":{"dur":0,"text":"They'll say things."},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"They'll create stores like,\nwell, yeah, I should have,"},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"but today I was late\nfor an appointment."},"718":{"dur":1,"text":"And if I'm not there,\nsomebody depending on me."},"720":{"dur":0,"text":"And so it was OK."},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"So they'll create all\nkinds of justifications"},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"for why it was OK for\nthem in the situation"},"725":{"dur":1,"text":"and how it doesn't\nreflect on the fact"},"727":{"dur":1,"text":"that they're an\nuntrustworthy person"},"728":{"dur":1,"text":"but they can be untrustworthy."},"730":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, in some way\nthat's a good thing."},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"It has to be adaptive,\nbecause if any of us"},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"felt like we couldn't\ntrust ourselves,"},"738":{"dur":1,"text":"that alternative is much worse."},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"Because it means we're not going\nto save money for the future"},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"because we know future us is\ngoing to go blow it a casino."},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"We're not going to diet\nand take care of our health"},"748":{"dur":1,"text":"because we assume\nthree days from now"},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going to gorge on ice\ncream or chocolate cake."},"752":{"dur":1,"text":"We're stuck with ourselves."},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"If somebody else\nis untrustworthy,"},"755":{"dur":1,"text":"we can stop\ninteracting with them."},"757":{"dur":2,"text":"We can't stop\ninteracting with ourself,"},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"and so we need to\ntrust ourselves even"},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"when we make mistakes."},"763":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's OK, but\nwhat I'm here to do"},"764":{"dur":1,"text":"is to help you\ntry and learn that"},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"so that you can decrease\nthe probability that you're"},"768":{"dur":1,"text":"actually going to\nmake those mistakes."},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"But what I haven't\ntold you yet is"},"771":{"dur":1,"text":"that there's any evidence\nthat people actually"},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"recognize what\nthey did was wrong."},"776":{"dur":1,"text":"So let me give you an example."},"778":{"dur":1,"text":"So in psychology\nwe had this method"},"780":{"dur":1,"text":"which is called cognitive load."},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's a way to kind of tie\nup people's mental resources"},"784":{"dur":2,"text":"so they can engage\nin rationalization."},"787":{"dur":1,"text":"And the way it works\nis we give them"},"788":{"dur":3,"text":"random digit strings of\nnumbers, say like seven digits."},"791":{"dur":1,"text":"And you have to\nremember these digits."},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"So what we're doing is you'll\nget a string of numbers,"},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"and you'll have to say\n7-6-5-4-1-0, 7-6-5-4-1-0,"},"798":{"dur":1,"text":"and then you'll have\nto answer a question,"},"800":{"dur":2,"text":"how trustworthily\ndid you just act?"},"802":{"dur":1,"text":"And you have to remember\nthese numbers because I'm"},"803":{"dur":1,"text":"going to have you\nenter them in a minute,"},"804":{"dur":1,"text":"and you've got to\nget them right."},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"And so what this does\nis it ties up your mind."},"808":{"dur":3,"text":"It prevents your mind from\nengaging in rationalization."},"811":{"dur":1,"text":"So when we did this\nexperiment again,"},"813":{"dur":4,"text":"and we have 90% of people who\ndid cheat even though they said"},"817":{"dur":4,"text":"they wouldn't, what you\nfind is on the white bars"},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"on the bottom, those who\nwere under cognitive load,"},"824":{"dur":2,"text":"there's no difference in\nhow you judge yourself"},"827":{"dur":0,"text":"or how you judge others."},"828":{"dur":1,"text":"And those are\nsignificantly less."},"829":{"dur":1,"text":"You see yourself\nas less trustworthy"},"831":{"dur":2,"text":"than when you have the\ntime to rationalize."},"833":{"dur":2,"text":"So the second, the\nmoment that you're"},"835":{"dur":3,"text":"committing the transgression,\nyour mind knows it."},"838":{"dur":2,"text":"You feel in your gut."},"841":{"dur":1,"text":"You feel that pang of guilt."},"843":{"dur":1,"text":"But what happens\nis you don't want"},"844":{"dur":2,"text":"to think of yourself\nas untrustworthy."},"846":{"dur":3,"text":"And so your mind engages\nin this

is you\ncouldn't know the person"},"1197":{"dur":3,"text":"with whom you were\nnow going to interact."},"1200":{"dur":2,"text":"We gave them five minutes\nto have a

about\nanything they wanted."},"1210":{"dur":3,"text":"And you're going to play a game\nfor real money, a game that"},"1213":{"dur":4,"text":"pits self-interest versus being\ntrustworthy, communal interest."},"1217":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'll show you how the\ngame works in a second."},"1219":{"dur":1,"text":"And then we gave\nthem topics to start,"},"1220":{"dur":2,"text":"but they could talk about\nanything that they wanted."},"1223":{"dur":0,"text":"So we brought them in."},"1224":{"dur":2,"text":"They simply sat\nacross from each other"},"1226":{"dur":1,"text":"at a table, half the

Google Chat"},"1244":{"dur":2,"text":"or Gchat-- any type\nof internet chat."},"1247":{"dur":3,"text":"And the logic for this is the\nsame amount of information"},"1251":{"dur":1,"text":"is being

their partner."},"1274":{"dur":2,"text":"And so this game is\ncalled the give some game."},"1276":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's a nice analog\nfor self-interest"},"1278":{"dur":1,"text":"versus communal interest."},"1279":{"dur":1,"text":"Because if you\nwant to be selfish,"},"1281":{"dur":2,"text":"you can try and get the other\nperson to give you all of his"},"1283":{"dur":0,"text":"and give nothing."},"1284":{"dur":3,"text":"And that means you'll have\n$12 and he'll have nothing."},"1288":{"dur":2,"text":"But the most trustworthy\nthing to do if you really"},"1290":{"dur":2,"text":"implicitly trust each other\nand want to benefit each other"},"1292":{"dur":2,"text":"is to exchange all you\nhave at the same time,"},"1294":{"dur":1,"text":"because then you all\nstarted with four"},"1296":{"dur":1,"text":"and now you have eight."},"1297":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we had people\nmaking real decisions"},"1300":{"dur":1,"text":"and we paid them accordingly."},"1302":{"dur":1,"text":"And we also had\nthem tell us what"},"1303":{"dur":3,"text":"they thought their\npartner was going to do."},"1306":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, the nice thing about\nit was whether or not"},"1309":{"dur":4,"text":"you talked to your partner\nover an internet chat"},"1313":{"dur":3,"text":"or face to face, the amount\nof trustworthy behavior"},"1316":{"dur":1,"text":"didn't change, which is nice."},"1318":{"dur":2,"text":"I think it's because people\nare now becoming very used"},"1320":{"dur":3,"text":"to communicating over\ninternet mediated platforms."},"1324":{"dur":1,"text":"And so it's not like\nbeing face to face"},"1325":{"dur":1,"text":"made people more trustworthy."},"1327":{"dur":2,"text":"There was people who\nwere cheating and being"},"1329":{"dur":2,"text":"cooperative at equal\nlevels in both cases."},"1331":{"dur":5,"text":"But here the axis is error,\nthe amount that you were off."},"1337":{"dur":3,"text":"And so lower bars mean accuracy\nin terms of absolute value."},"1341":{"dur":3,"text":"If you were in the presence\nof the other person,"},"1344":{"dur":2,"text":"your guess for how\nmuch that person"},"1346":{"dur":3,"text":"was going to be trustworthy or\ncheat you in absolute dollars"},"1349":{"dur":2,"text":"was significantly greater."},"1351":{"dur":3,"text":"So what this tells us is that\npeople are picking up on a cue."},"1355":{"dur":2,"text":"There is some information there\nthat your mind is gleaning"},"1358":{"dur":3,"text":"from body language,\nwhether you know it or not."},"1361":{"dur":2,"text":"And so what we did\nnext was we ran"},"1363":{"dur":3,"text":"models of all these possible\ncombinations of cues"},"1366":{"dur":1,"text":"to see what would matter."},"1367":{"dur":3,"text":"And the model that\npredicted untrustworthiness"},"1371":{"dur":3,"text":"the best consisted of four\ncues, touching your hands,"},"1375":{"dur":3,"text":"touching your face, crossing\nyour arms, and leaning away."},"1378":{"dur":2,"text":"If you think about it,\nwhat does this really mean?"},"1380":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, we know from the\nnonverbal literature"},"1382":{"dur":2,"text":"that fidgeting with\nyour hands and touching"},"1384":{"dur":3,"text":"your face repeatedly is\nusually a marker of anxiety"},"1388":{"dur":2,"text":"and not feeling comfortable."},"1390":{"dur":1,"text":"Crossing your arms\nand leaning away"},"1392":{"dur":2,"text":"is a marker of I don't\nwant to affiliate with you."},"1394":{"dur":1,"text":"Put them together,\nwhat does it mean?"},"1396":{"dur":2,"text":"It means, I don't really\nwant to be with you."},"1398":{"dur":0,"text":"I don't like you."},"1399":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'm nervous\nbecause I'm going"},"1401":{"dur":1,"text":"to screw you over in a minute."},"1402":{"dur":3,"text":"And so none of these cues\npredict it on their own,"},"1406":{"dur":2,"text":"but together they did."},"1408":{"dur":5,"text":"So the more often you saw a\npartner show this set of cues,"},"1413":{"dur":2,"text":"the smaller number of tokens\nyou expected that person"},"1415":{"dur":2,"text":"to share with you, which meant\nthe more selfish you thought"},"1418":{"dur":1,"text":"that person was going to be."},"1419":{"dur":2,"text":"And the more often you\nyourself or any subject"},"1422":{"dur":3,"text":"emitted this four set of\ncues, the less trustworthy you"},"1425":{"dur":2,"text":"actually were, the\nmore tokens you"},"1428":{"dur":2,"text":"kept and tried to get from the\nother person without sharing."},"1430":{"dur":2,"text":"And so in some sense, what we're\nshowing is ground truth here."},"1433":{"dur":3,"text":"These cues are predicting\nactual financial cheating"},"1436":{"dur":1,"text":"versus cooperative behavior."},"1437":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, the most\ninteresting part about it"},"1439":{"dur":3,"text":"was if you asked our\nsubjects, so what did you use?"},"1443":{"dur":0,"text":"They had no idea."},"1444":{"dur":1,"text":"Or they would suggest\nit was other cues that"},"1446":{"dur":1,"text":"didn't predict anything."},"1447":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah, I showed you they\nwere more accurate when"},"1449":{"dur":0,"text":"they saw the person."},"1450":{"dur":3,"text":"And they adjusted their numbers\nand guesses accordingly."},"1454":{"dur":3,"text":"So what this means is your\nmind is using these cues"},"1457":{"dur":3,"text":"even though you're not\naware of what they are."},"1460":{"dur":3,"text":"It's still building\nintuitions with them."},"1463":{"dur":1,"text":"But how do you know\nthose are the right cues?"},"1465":{"dur":1,"text":"People are doing lots of things."},"1466":{"dur":1,"text":"How do I know that when\nI'm crossing my arms,"},"1468":{"dur":1,"text":"it's not that my left\npupil is dilating"},"1470":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's the magic cue."},"1472":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, being scientists, we\nneeded to have precise control."},"1475":{"dur":1,"text":"No matter what actor\nI had, I couldn't"},"1477":{"dur":2,"text":"get them to have\nexceedingly precise control"},"1480":{"dur":2,"text":"of every expression\nthey're emitting."},"1482":{"dur":1,"text":"So what do you do?"},"1483":{"dur":1,"text":"You need a robot."},"1485":{"dur":2,"text":"So this robot, her name is Nexi."},"1488":{"dur":2,"text":"She was designed and created\nby my collaborator Cynthia"},"1490":{"dur":2,"text":"Breazeal at MIT's Media Lab."},"1492":{"dur":1,"text":"And so we simply used Nexi."},"1493":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'll show you a\nvideo of it in a moment."},"1496":{"dur":1,"text":"But the experiment was simple."},"1497":{"dur":2,"text":"We repeated the same\nthing we did before,"},"1500":{"dur":4,"text":"except we replaced one of\nthe people with the robot."},"1504":{"dur":2,"text":"So now you're talking\nto this robot."},"1506":{"dur":4,"text":"And the robot will emit the\ncues and express the cues"},"1510":{"dur":3,"text":"that we think signify\nuntrustworthiness or not"},"1514":{"dur":2,"text":"in a very, very precisely\ncontrollable way."},"1516":{"dur":1,"text":"The robot was controlled\nby two people, one"},"1518":{"dur":3,"text":"who was the voice of the robot,\nthe other who would control"},"1521":{"dur":1,"text":"whether or not\nshe made the cues."},"1523":{"dur":2,"text":"Because you don't want\nthe same person doing it,"},"1525":{"dur":2,"text":"because they might give\ncues in their vocal tone."},"1527":{"dur":1,"text":"And because I know a lot\nof you are engineers,"},"1529":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll give you a quick\nidea of how this worked."},"1531":{"dur":2,"text":"The one person here\nyou can see who"},"1533":{"dur":1,"text":"is sitting in front\nof the computer,"},"1535":{"dur":1,"text":"there's a webcam on her face."},"1536":{"dur":3,"text":"As she moves her head,\nit's gotten by the webcam."},"1540":{"dur":1,"text":"The robot's head\nmoves in real time."},"1541":{"dur":1,"text":"She's wearing a mic\nhere, so as she speaks,"},"1543":{"dur":2,"text":"it picks up the phonemes\nand the robot's mouth"},"1545":{"dur":1,"text":"moves in real time."},"1547":{"dur":1,"text":"The next person controls\nwhether the robot"},"1548":{"dur":3,"text":"gives these untrustworthy\ncues or other similar cues."},"1551":{"dur":3,"text":"And the third person is\nour robot mischief person"},"1555":{"dur":2,"text":"who basically controls\nand monitors the system."},"1558":{"dur":2,"text":"Because every once in\nawhile, it would go haywire"},"1560":{"dur":4,"text":"and the robot would like\nit's doing something crazy,"},"1564":{"dur":2,"text":"like it's possessed\nor something."},"1566":{"dur":0,"text":"It would break down."},"1567":{"dur":2,"text":"But normally it worked\nwonderfully and just fine."},"1570":{"dur":1,"text":"And so we had participants,\n65 participants"},"1572":{"dur":0,"text":"from the community."},"1573":{"dur":2,"text":"We brought in 31 of them."},"1575":{"dur":1,"text":"We showed that we\nhad seen the

arms."},"1584":{"dur":2,"text":"Here's a picture of\nit touching its face."},"1586":{"dur":0,"text":"I'll show you a\nvideo in a second."},"1587":{"dur":2,"text":"So the first part is people\nhave to get used to the fact"},"1589":{"dur":1,"text":"that they're talking to a robot."},"1590":{"dur":2,"text":"So we had this kind of\npart where they just"},"1592":{"dur":1,"text":"acclimated to

caring,"},"3025":{"dur":2,"text":"and so it's always going\nto be in an equilibrium."},"3027":{"dur":2,"text":"The question is, can we\nincrease the set point"},"3029":{"dur":2,"text":"for
