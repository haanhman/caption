enough."},"2653":{"dur":1,"text":"So the idea of fog came up."},"2655":{"dur":1,"text":"So we started doing\nsome research in the US"},"2657":{"dur":2,"text":"and actually there was\nanother Sneden's

the fog,"},"2745":{"dur":2,"text":"Bob Breer made sculptures called,"},"2749":{"dur":2,"text":"he called them floats or creepies,"},"2751":{"dur":3,"text":"and they moved very, very\nslowly around,
