up into a trunk, into a tree trunk."},"713":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we all start as artists, we all start\nby climbing the trunk."},"717":{"dur":4,"text":"So we\u2019re kind of hugging the trunk,

up."},"989":{"dur":3,"text":"You wrote, \u201cA lot of emotion laden messages\nare provocative."},"992":{"dur":5,"text":"They\u2019re designed to elicit a desired reaction,\nbut often with little

that"},"1020":{"dur":1,"text":"we\u2019re trying to reach, that we\u2019re trying\nto serve."},"1021":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think provocation, control can achieve\nresults in the short

think we have to"},"1044":{"dur":2,"text":"focus on evocation, not provocation."},"1047":{"dur":4,"text":"We all knew that neighborhood bully, right,\nthe sort of line in the sand person who, you"},"1051":{"dur":4,"text":"know, was all about putting a finger in your\nchest and provoking you and trying to control"},"1055":{"dur":1,"text":"you."},"1056":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think, you

right."},"1135":{"dur":3,"text":"And you mentioned something, taking responsibility\nfor your body of work."},"1139":{"dur":1,"text":"Right?"},"1140":{"dur":1,"text":"And ultimately I think that\u2019s what developing\nyour voice is about."},"1142":{"dur":3,"text":"It\u2019s about taking responsibility for the\nimpact that you want to have in the world,"},"1145":{"dur":3,"text":"understanding your identity, who you are,\nand what you really care about."},"1149":{"dur":3,"text":"It\u2019s about understanding the vision that\nyou have for

what you"},"1157":{"dur":3,"text":"need to be responsible for so you can bring\nthat body of work into the world."},"1160":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think that at the heart of it, that\nreally is the
