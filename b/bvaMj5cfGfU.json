That is what"},"772":{"dur":6,"text":"we attempted to do. That work showed itself\nin terms of the way we allocated resources"},"779":{"dur":6,"text":"across the NHS and in the way we produced\na really important document for us, a really"},"785":{"dur":4,"text":"important document in the sense that it was\nsetting out our vision for the future and"},"790":{"dur":5,"text":"the things that we need to do -- it was called\n'Everyone Counts', and it was called 'Everyone"},"795":{"dur":5,"text":"Counts' on purpose, because that is what the\nNHS is all about: being inclusive for all"},"800":{"dur":3,"text":"of our people, no matter where they are, no\nmatter who they are, no matter where they"},"804":{"dur":5,"text":"live.

Those of you who have been involved\nin the NHS for a long time know how difficult"},"850":{"dur":5,"text":"it has been to plan beyond the end of the\nfinancial year -- how difficult it is to think"},"856":{"dur":6,"text":"three, five or ten years out about what a\ncompelling vision for the NHS might be, a"},"862":{"dur":6,"text":"vision that we can really work to over that\nperiod. That is why we have announced the"},"868":{"dur":6,"text":"call to action; that is why we are absolutely\ndetermined, as an organisation, not to think"},"875":{"dur":4,"text":"about how we are going to survive over the\nnext year to 18 months, but about how we can"},"879":{"dur":7,"text":"build a fantastic, sustainable NHS going forward.\nThat call to action is a critical part of"},"887":{"dur":7,"text":"what uniquely NHS England can do. Part of\nthe workshops today was to think about what"},"894":{"dur":3,"text":"that great, compelling vision might be -- not\nsomething that we would create, not something"},"898":{"dur":4,"text":"that our Board can sit in a room and think\nabout what it is, but actually to work with"},"903":{"dur":5,"text":"a public, with patients, with clinicians,\nwith the staff of the NHS, to work out what"},"909":{"dur":4,"text":"it might look like in very challenging and\nconstrained times."},"913":{"dur":6,"text":"Driving transparency\nThe second lesson that we've learned is not"},"919":{"dur":8,"text":"only the importance of transparency but how\nwe have to drive it even faster and even harder"},"928":{"dur":7,"text":"in the future. One of the issues about the\nNHS is that there's always been, in my experience,"},"935":{"dur":6,"text":"a big difference between what those of us\nwho are responsible for the service and work"},"941":{"dur":7,"text":"in it know about it, and what the public and\nwhat patients know about it. It is obvious"},"949":{"dur":4,"text":"in all sorts of ways -- everything from the\nway in which sometimes healthcare systems"},"954":{"dur":7,"text":"harm patients, right the way through to the\nway in which mortality is counted and happens"},"961":{"dur":7,"text":"in hospitals. Over the past period, we have\nconsistently published more and more data,"},"969":{"dur":8,"text":"from the outcome data for the 10 specialities\nright the way through to a whole plethora"},"978":{"dur":4,"text":"of information about mortality in patients\nthat we have produced."},"982":{"dur":4,"text":"That is very, very uncomfortable for the NHS,\nvery difficult for the NHS. And every day"},"987":{"dur":5,"text":"you can see more data coming out, where we\nare being much more transparent about what"},"992":{"dur":6,"text":"a real healthcare system is and what the strengths\nand weaknesses of it are. It is really difficult,"},"999":{"dur":5,"text":"both for people who work in the NHS and who\nsupport the NHS, to see some of this and some"},"1004":{"dur":6,"text":"of the criticisms that are laid onto the NHS\nas we go forward. However, it is really important"},"1011":{"dur":5,"text":"that we do it -- and not only important that\nwe do it, but that we do more of it and that"},"1016":{"dur":8,"text":"we do it faster. Only in that way will we,\nin the medium to long term, build confidence"},"1024":{"dur":4,"text":"between the service and the patients and public\nwho use it."},"1029":{"dur":5,"text":"It is going to be very tough, and some people\nmight say: why would you inflict this pain"},"1035":{"dur":6,"text":"on yourself in that way?

In my view, it is the"},"1041":{"dur":5,"text":"difference between success and failure of\nour healthcare system, the NHS, going forward."},"1046":{"dur":5,"text":"So it is really important that we really drive\nfaster and harder in terms of transparency."},"1051":{"dur":4,"text":"Thinking about our assets\nThe third lesson we have learned is to think"},"1055":{"dur":7,"text":"about our assets. I am sure that many of us\nin the NHS, sometimes when we sit down and"},"1063":{"dur":7,"text":"talk about it we say: the problem is x or\nthe problem is y. That is fine, because we"},"1071":{"dur":5,"text":"have to deal with those issues. However, as\nan organisation, we really need to think much"},"1076":{"dur":5,"text":"more about our assets. Three I would particularly\nidentify for us."},"1082":{"dur":2,"text":"Clinical Commissioning Groups\nThe first one is the clinical commissioning"},"1084":{"dur":4,"text":"groups. We have created the clinical commissioning\ngroups. General practitioners and all the"},"1089":{"dur":7,"text":"clinicians have created 211 organisations\nacross the NHS -- brand new organisations"},"1097":{"dur":5,"text":"with new ideas, with new potential. I travel\nall over the country meeting people in clinical"},"1103":{"dur":4,"text":"commissioning groups and it is absolutely\nremarkable, the way in which they are bringing"},"1107":{"dur":5,"text":"their clinical knowledge, their clinical understanding\nto move and change services in a way I could"},"1113":{"dur":6,"text":"never have imagined in the past. A critical\npart of our role in the future is to nurture"},"1120":{"dur":4,"text":"that asset, to give it the support that it\nneeds, and to make sure that those clinical"},"1124":{"dur":4,"text":"commissioning groups can be absolutely fantastic\nfor their local populations."},"1129":{"dur":5,"text":"Nurturing our staff\nThe second asset to nurture is our staff,"},"1134":{"dur":3,"text":"and I would identify one particular aspect\nhere. Clearly there is the staff of the NHS"},"1138":{"dur":5,"text":"as a whole, but we have a particular responsibility,\nI think, for the people who work with us in"},"1143":{"dur":4,"text":"NHS England -- just over 6,000 people who\nare all over the country, who work in every"},"1148":{"dur":8,"text":"locality, in every area. If you think about\nwhat happened in the past and now, the functions"},"1156":{"dur":6,"text":"we have taken over as NHS England -- we now\nhave half the number of staff that we would"},"1162":{"dur":5,"text":"have had in the past to do them.
