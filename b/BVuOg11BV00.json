another 13% with\npropane, the cost of which"},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"has declined dramatically\nin the last 10 years."},"550":{"dur":4,"text":"And, the industry in Iowa\nhas doubled its

the sizes of the\nparticles are about right."},"632":{"dur":4,"text":"That makes them quite perfect\nfor the fracking industry."},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"And, I don't know, they've\nlooked at other places,"},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"but this is probably some of the"},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"best stuff in the country for the process."},"649":{"dur":3,"text":"- So, tell us about Iowa's\nissues related to fracking,"},"653":{"dur":1,"text":"what other questions\nwe're dealing with now,"},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"in northeast Iowa, but\npotentially other parts of Iowa,"},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"too, related to this industry."},"660":{"dur":1,"text":"- Well there's a bunch."},"663":{"dur":4,"text":"First of all, when you\ndo any kind of mining,"},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"it's not a pretty sight, okay."},"670":{"dur":3,"text":"We're used to a lot of\nnear-surface mining in Iowa,"},"673":{"dur":1,"text":"we call them

those."},"692":{"dur":3,"text":"So, in some ways, one\nof the frac sand mines"},"695":{"dur":3,"text":"is just like that, but\nthere's a difference,"},"699":{"dur":3,"text":"because of the demand,\nand the pace of the mining"},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"that they do, it just moves fast."},"705":{"dur":4,"text":"So, the trucks may run a\ncouple hundred a day, 24\/7,"},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"and in that area, if\nyou're familiar with that"},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"Upper Mississippi\nValley, it's very pretty,"},"717":{"dur":3,"text":"the bluff country, cold\nwater trout streams,"},"720":{"dur":2,"text":"a lot more forest than cornfields,"},"723":{"dur":3,"text":"and this rips it up, so that's a lot."},"727":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, some of the environmental impacts,"},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"they're probably actually not as great"},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"as the ones that we don't regulate,"},"737":{"dur":3,"text":"which really is that landscape impact"},"742":{"dur":3,"text":"in places that, should\nwe be doing this or not."},"746":{"dur":1,"text":"- Help me understand what you mean,"},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"places we don't regulate."},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"- Well, there are certain\nthings that are regulated"},"754":{"dur":1,"text":"from an environmental point of view."},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"How much water you use,\nwhere you discharge it,"},"760":{"dur":4,"text":"how you handle your dust,\nrun-off from a mine site,"},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"there are things that\nfall under regulation,"},"769":{"dur":2,"text":"but a lot of things don't, terribly well."},"771":{"dur":1,"text":"- Right, meaning things\nlike the new traffic"},"773":{"dur":3,"text":"to the area, all of the\nimpacts on communities nearby,"},"776":{"dur":1,"text":"and then just the aesthetic changes"},"778":{"dur":1,"text":"that result.\n- Exactly, exactly, that's not"},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"there's not a rule in the books\nthat says you can do that."},"784":{"dur":2,"text":"A couple of the counties in northeast Iowa"},"786":{"dur":3,"text":"put moratoriums on frac sand mining,"},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"and have written regulations that if you"},"792":{"dur":4,"text":"read between the lines, it\nkinda says don't mine here."},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"And they didn't do this thoughtlessly,"},"798":{"dur":3,"text":"they thought about it\nhard, because there's jobs,"},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"but they also looked north to Wisconsin."},"804":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's some counties in Wisconsin,"},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"where over a period of a year or two only,"},"808":{"dur":4,"text":"15, 20 mines opened up, and\nit really overwhelmed things,"},"814":{"dur":2,"text":"and folks up there looked at that and went"},"816":{"dur":3,"text":"let's do a time out, and\nfigure out what's coming in."},"820":{"dur":1,"text":"Not that we want to say no to"},"821":{"dur":3,"text":"the possibility of mining one, but yeah."},"828":{"dur":1,"text":"- Could we talk for just a second, too,"},"829":{"dur":2,"text":"one of the issues I know you\ndeal with was water quality,"},"832":{"dur":2,"text":"and we've talked about all the water"},"834":{"dur":4,"text":"that is pushed into a fracking operation."},"838":{"dur":3,"text":"But, what about the waste water\nthat comes from these areas?"},"841":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not just here in Iowa, but what are"},"843":{"dur":2,"text":"some of the concerns with the water"},"845":{"dur":3,"text":"that comes back up after\nthe drilling happens?"},"849":{"dur":4,"text":"- The two big environmental\nissues with fracking,"},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"aside from just the disruptiveness of it,"},"856":{"dur":2,"text":"mining can be disruptive."},"858":{"dur":4,"text":"For a drilling operation in a\nsort of densely populated area"},"863":{"dur":4,"text":"like Pennsylvania, it's\nvery disruptive, very loud,"},"868":{"dur":4,"text":"you've got dust, you've got\nemissions, toxic emissions."},"873":{"dur":4,"text":"The issues are methane\nleakage, and then the disposal"},"881":{"dur":4,"text":"of the water that flows back\nthat you put in to frack,"},"886":{"dur":3,"text":"that's called flowback water,\nand then the produced water,"},"889":{"dur":2,"text":"so when you produce oil and\ngas, you don't just produce"},"892":{"dur":3,"text":"oil and gas, you produce water,\nand it's usually very briny,"},"896":{"dur":3,"text":"salty, and you can't just\ndump that into the river,"},"899":{"dur":3,"text":"and you have to figure out\nsomething to do with it."},"902":{"dur":2,"text":"This is probably the big issue."},"906":{"dur":3,"text":"They had some municipal\ntreatment plants in Pennsylvania"},"910":{"dur":2,"text":"that couldn't treat this\nstuff, and they started"},"912":{"dur":1,"text":"putting into the water."},"915":{"dur":2,"text":"Lot of states, and fracking is"},"917":{"dur":2,"text":"really regulated at the state level."},"919":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean, there's some\nfederal laws that control"},"924":{"dur":4,"text":"some of the environmental\nemissions and water issues,"},"929":{"dur":1,"text":"And some exemptions from federal laws"},"931":{"dur":3,"text":"that the oil industry\nhas been able to obtain."},"935":{"dur":2,"text":"But, usually they do one of two things"},"938":{"dur":2,"text":"with all of the water that\ncomes back out of the well."},"940":{"dur":4,"text":"They re-inject it into,\nre-inject it back into the Earth,"},"947":{"dur":4,"text":"deep into the Earth,\nusually, sometimes old wells,"},"951":{"dur":4,"text":"or they recycle it, they\ntreat it, and reuse it."},"956":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, recent, one of the\nmost alarming things about"},"960":{"dur":3,"text":"the re-injection of the\nwastewater is in places"},"964":{"dur":4,"text":"like Oklahoma, where just last\nweek we had a 5.6 magnitude"},"969":{"dur":3,"text":"earthquake that was felt in Des

about\nthis, and it lubricates"},"981":{"dur":1,"text":"the faults and you get, they've had"},"983":{"dur":2,"text":"hundreds of earthquakes in Oklahoma."},"985":{"dur":4,"text":"Following this last earthquake,\nthe Oklahoma regulator"},"989":{"dur":4,"text":"has put a moratorium\non new well injections."},"994":{"dur":3,"text":"So, that is probably\nthe biggest issue with"},"997":{"dur":3,"text":"the actual fracking and drilling process."},"1003":{"dur":1,"text":"- If you want to say just a (stammering)"},"1004":{"dur":1,"text":"- I'm just gonna say that the industry,"},"1006":{"dur":4,"text":"there's a lot of focus\non the kinds of chemicals"},"1010":{"dur":4,"text":"they inject, and add to the\nwater, and pump into the ground,"},"1016":{"dur":1,"text":"because the companies that do that"},"1018":{"dur":3,"text":"don't like to talk about what they are."},"1021":{"dur":4,"text":"But frankly, the water that\ncomes out, that briny water"},"1026":{"dur":2,"text":"that's been living down\nthere tooth and nail"},"1028":{"dur":3,"text":"with oil and natural gas\nfor 300 million years"},"1031":{"dur":2,"text":"is a lot worse than the\nchemicals they're putting."},"1034":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's how you handle that wastewater,"},"1038":{"dur":1,"text":"yeah, that's the big one."},"1040":{"dur":2,"text":"- People don't like the\nidea of fracturing the rock"},"1042":{"dur":2,"text":"way down, and there's\nworries that the chemicals"},"1045":{"dur":2,"text":"will come up into aquifers,\nthat'll never happen."},"1048":{"dur":3,"text":"The well casing might leak, or fail,"},"1051":{"dur":2,"text":"but that could happen\nwith any oil and gas well."},"1053":{"dur":2,"text":"The big issues are not\nso

out of the well, so"},"1082":{"dur":3,"text":"we need good regulation to deal with this."},"1087":{"dur":3,"text":"One thing I wanted to add,\neveryone should understand,"},"1090":{"dur":2,"text":"and

that to happen, but"},"1114":{"dur":4,"text":"we really need to think through\nthe implications of this."},"1119":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, yeah, oh I wish\nwe could keep going"},"1121":{"dur":1,"text":"with this segment, but we're gonna turn to"},"1123":{"dur":2,"text":"a slightly different\nside of all of this now,"},"1126":{"dur":2,"text":"and I would like to
