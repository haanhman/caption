send Bruce Willis, right?"},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"If an asteroid is\ncoming to hit the Earth,"},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"put a nuclear bomb\non the surface"},"554":{"dur":1,"text":"and obliterate\nit, right?"},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's one possible method."},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"And if it was\ncoming really fast,"},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"and we didn't have\na lot of time,"},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"that might be the\nmethod that we chose."},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"But there's actually\nseveral other ways"},"567":{"dur":3,"text":"that we might deflect\nthat asteroid."},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"And some of them don't require\nlaunching a nuclear bomb"},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"off the coast of Florida."},"576":{"dur":3,"text":"The method we've selected is\na

right?"},"584":{"dur":1,"text":"But it's the technique we think"},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"we can achieve\nwith this mission,"},"587":{"dur":3,"text":"and so we collect that\nboulder, and the combined mass"},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"of the spacecraft and\nthe boulder is enough"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"that when we hover\nin a halo orbit"},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"on one side of the asteroid,\nthe gravitational attraction"},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"between us and that\nparent asteroid"},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"will slowly tug it, over the\ncourse of several months,"},"605":{"dur":1,"text":"and change its orbit."},"606":{"dur":3,"text":"So we're tracking all of the\npotentially hazardous asteroids"},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"that are gonna come\nand hit the Earth."},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"By the way, nothing\nto worry about"},"613":{"dur":4,"text":"for the next 50 to 100 years,\nbut we're tracking them."},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we could send one of\nthese missions out in advance,"},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"demonstrate that we've\npushed it off course,"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"and then continue to track\nit to confirm that it is,"},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"in fact, no longer a threat."},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"So to get that boulder,\nto increase our mass,"},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"to make that gravity\ntractor extra effective,"},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"we're gonna use these grippers."},"637":{"dur":4,"text":"So two of these grippers\nthat are about yea big"},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"are gonna grab that big\nboulder you see in the back."},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's a mock up that's\nat the Satellite Servicing Lab"},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"out at Goddard\nSpace Flight Center."},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"So how do you grab a rock?"},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"We use a technology\ncalled microspines."},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"They're basically sharp hooks"},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"and flexible\nsuspension structures."},"660":{"dur":1,"text":"So you drag them\nalong the surface,"},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"and they opportunistically\ncatch hold"},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"of bumps, pits,\nledges, ramps, holes."},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"They only need really\nsmall roughness."},"671":{"dur":3,"text":"Much smaller than what you\nmight grip with your hand."},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact, in these prototypes,\nwe're using fishhooks."},"676":{"dur":1,"text":"So you can imagine\ndragging a sharp fishhook"},"678":{"dur":3,"text":"across a rock, it's gonna\ncatch pretty readily."},"681":{"dur":1,"text":"A key feature of\nthese microspines,"},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"is that when they catch, they\ndon't prevent their neighbors"},"685":{"dur":3,"text":"from also trying to search\nout a good place to catch."},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"So they load share."},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"Each microspine only holds\none or two pounds of force,"},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"but you can use them\nby the thousands,"},"695":{"dur":4,"text":"and only need 10% or so to\nsupport a really large load."},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"So here's what one\nof those looks like"},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"as it drags across the surface."},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"You can see the hook\ncatches, and when it catches,"},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"you'll notice the yellow sort\nof rubber band-like feature"},"712":{"dur":1,"text":"in the back stretches out."},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"That's when it's supporting\nthat one or two pounds of force."},"717":{"dur":3,"text":"And again, we only need\n10% or so of these to catch"},"720":{"dur":4,"text":"in order to support the loads\nwe need for the mission."},"728":{"dur":4,"text":"So in order to grab a rock, we\nneed more than just that tip."},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"Rocks are rough on a macro\nscale as well as a micro scale,"},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"and so we use a\nhierarchical compliance"},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"to try and conform to\nthe rock's geometry"},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"at all of the different\nlength scales."},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"And since we're doing\nthis in microgravity,"},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"we use oppositional microspines."},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"So they're reacting\nagainst one another,"},"752":{"dur":1,"text":"they're all squeezing\ntowards the center,"},"753":{"dur":3,"text":"so that you don't need any\ngravity to load them up."},"756":{"dur":1,"text":"And they can support forces"},"758":{"dur":3,"text":"that you might exert in\nany different direction."},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"And, of course, since\nwe're going to an asteroid,"},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"we better make sure\nthat they can withstand"},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"the extreme environment\nthat we're gonna find there."},"768":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is vacuum,"},"769":{"dur":2,"text":"potentially very cold\ntemperatures, as well."},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"So those rubber band-like\nfeatures I showed you before,"},"774":{"dur":1,"text":"those are not gonna work."},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"So we've done a\nlot of development"},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"to make metallic\nversions of microspines"},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"that can withstand\nthose cold temperatures."},"784":{"dur":2,"text":"On the first point, the\nhierarchical compliance,"},"786":{"dur":3,"text":"most natural surfaces\nhave fractal roughness,"},"790":{"dur":3,"text":"meaning they're rough at every\nlength scale you look at."},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"So as you continue to\nincrease your magnification"},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"with the microscope, all you see"},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"is the same level of roughness."},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"So to match that, we use\na hierarchical system"},"802":{"dur":3,"text":"that can conform at all of\nthose different length scales."},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"So the microspines grip\nat the milometer scale,"},"808":{"dur":3,"text":"we put those into cassettes\nthat can conform to the rock"},"812":{"dur":3,"text":"at centimeter scale, and we use\nthe robotic arms to place us"},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"in position at the\n10 centimeter,"},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"100 centimeter scale."},"821":{"dur":1,"text":"So you can see that in action."},"823":{"dur":3,"text":"Here, you've seen some of\nthese microspines have caught,"},"826":{"dur":2,"text":"they've stretched out,\nthey're sharing the load"},"828":{"dur":2,"text":"between any of them that\nhave stretched out here."},"831":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's see, you can\nsee these have caught."},"834":{"dur":1,"text":"And then these here\nhave not caught."},"835":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is more than 10%,\nwe have a very good grip."},"839":{"dur":3,"text":"You can see here, some of that\ncentimeter scale compliance."},"843":{"dur":3,"text":"Some of these cassettes have\ngone to different angles"},"847":{"dur":1,"text":"to conform to the\nrock, and some of them"},"848":{"dur":3,"text":"have squeezed in\ncloser to the gripper."},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"Another demonstration, you\ncan see both of those levels"},"855":{"dur":3,"text":"happening here and\nsupporting some force."},"858":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is about 25 pounds,\n30 pounds on the left and"},"863":{"dur":4,"text":"20 pounds on the right with\nsome of our early prototypes."},"868":{"dur":1,"text":"Here's a video that's\nshowing you how that works."},"870":{"dur":2,"text":"We have two actuations,"},"873":{"dur":2,"text":"two mechanisms that\nare at play here."},"875":{"dur":2,"text":"One that puts those\ncassettes up and down,"},"878":{"dur":3,"text":"and the other one that squeezes\nthem in towards the center."},"881":{"dur":2,"text":"So the idea is, you\ncome into the rock,"},"883":{"dur":2,"text":"you deploy your microspines,\nthey all conform"},"885":{"dur":3,"text":"to whatever roughness they\nfind, you squeeze together,"},"889":{"dur":2,"text":"and now you've got a good grip."},"891":{"dur":2,"text":"You just reverse that\nprocess to let go."},"893":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's a reusable gripper."},"898":{"dur":1,"text":"Here's some of the\nwork we've been doing"},"899":{"dur":3,"text":"to make these\nmicrospines space-grade."},"902":{"dur":1,"text":"You can see some of\nthe early prototypes"},"904":{"dur":1,"text":"in the upper left when\nwe are using those"},"905":{"dur":3,"text":"rubber band-like\npolyurethane flexures."},"909":{"dur":2,"text":"We used some extension\nsprings, they kind of thing"},"911":{"dur":2,"text":"you would find in a ballpoint\npen, and then we used"},"914":{"dur":2,"text":"these sort of curly Q flexures\nwhere we started using"},"916":{"dur":3,"text":"the aluminum itself as\nthe spring material."},"921":{"dur":1,"text":"If you look in the\ncenter, you can see"},"922":{"dur":2,"text":"we went to sort of\nzig-zag like flexures."},"924":{"dur":3,"text":"And on the right, we've actually\nbeen gluing in very thin"},"928":{"dur":3,"text":"steel ribbons that are acting\nlike a leaf spring to provide"},"931":{"dur":3,"text":"that compliance, mimicking\nwhat the rubber band does."},"935":{"dur":2,"text":"In the lower left,\nwe've been experimenting"},"937":{"dur":2,"text":"with different kinds of hooks."},"939":{"dur":3,"text":"So we have a fish hook,\nwhich is a conical point,"},"942":{"dur":2,"text":"we've also been looking at\nrazor blades, so more of"},"944":{"dur":4,"text":"a shovel tip, and some more\nexotic things even than that."},"950":{"dur":2,"text":"These are now being\ncarried on a linkage."},"952":{"dur":2,"text":"And here you can see some\nof this iterative

interesting thing."},"4483":{"dur":2,"text":"We don't think of\nautonomy as on or off,"},"4485":{"dur":2,"text":"we think of it as\na slider between"},"4487":{"dur":3,"text":"fully teleoperated\nand

15 degrees to the right."},"4503":{"dur":2,"text":"So what we do is\nwe augment the user"},"4505":{"dur":3,"text":"by steering to match the\ngravity vector, right?"},"4509":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is sort of autonomy,"},"4511":{"dur":4,"text":"but it's also still being\ncontrolled by an operator."},"4515":{"dur":2,"text":"On the further side for\nthe rock climbing

the\nenvironment on Mars"},"4634":{"dur":2,"text":"is obviously very extreme."},"4639":{"dur":1,"text":"It's funny that our group name"},"4640":{"dur":1,"text":"is Extreme Environment

consideration."},"4648":{"dur":2,"text":"In the prototyping\nphase, we haven't really"},"4650":{"dur":4,"text":"been too concerned about\nthe thermal environment"},"4654":{"dur":3,"text":"or

ones, I think."},"4710":{"dur":1,"text":"(audience laughing)"},"4711":{"dur":2,"text":"The question here is what are\nthe major challenges in moving"},"4714":{"dur":3,"text":"the grippers from field\ntests to space flight tests?"},"4718":{"dur":2,"text":"That's a great question."},"4720":{"dur":2,"text":"Some of the challenges\nare technical"},"4722":{"dur":3,"text":"like figuring out\nhow to make it robust"},"4726":{"dur":2,"text":"across all of the\ndifferent rock types."},"4728":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's easy when you're\ndeveloping something in the lab"},"4731":{"dur":1,"text":"to

is actually\na little different."},"4739":{"dur":3,"text":"We're going to have to go\nback and fix some things."},"4742":{"dur":2,"text":"So some of the technical\nchallenges are in making it"},"4745":{"dur":3,"text":"robust, making sure it\ndoesn't break over time."},"4749":{"dur":2,"text":"But some of the other\nchallenges to moving"},"4751":{"dur":4,"text":"from the lab to space flight\nare actually programmatic."},"4755":{"dur":2,"text":"You need to be in the right\nplace at the right time,"},"4758":{"dur":3,"text":"so if you're developing a\ntechnology that's really tuned"},"4761":{"dur":3,"text":"for Venus, and the next\nmission is going to Mars,"},"4764":{"dur":2,"text":"you've got a mismatch\nthere, and so there's always"},"4767":{"dur":4,"text":"a little bit

missions."},"4780":{"dur":2,"text":"So some of the\nchallenges can be of that"},"4783":{"dur":3,"text":"more personal or\nnon-technical variety."},"4789":{"dur":2,"text":"I guess the other one,\nwhich is a big driver,"},"4791":{"dur":4,"text":"is testing, the costs of\ndoing environmental testing"},"4795":{"dur":4,"text":"and really validating your\ntechnology can be very high."},"4799":{"dur":3,"text":"So to do that on an R&D budget\ncan be a real challenge."},"4803":{"dur":1,"text":"And sometimes there's a mismatch"},"4805":{"dur":2,"text":"between what a mission\nis willing to pay for"},"4807":{"dur":3,"text":"and what the technology\nprogram is willing to pay for"},"4810":{"dur":2,"text":"where you have to try and\nprove that you're ready"},"4812":{"dur":2,"text":"for the mission, but in\norder to do that testing,"},"4815":{"dur":3,"text":"you need the dollars that are\nassociated with the mission."},"4819":{"dur":4,"text":"So sometimes, it's trying to\nscrap together a story that"},"4823":{"dur":4,"text":"really proves that it's gonna\nwork in that environment."},"4827":{"dur":2,"text":"So the second question here is"},"4831":{"dur":3,"text":"are AI and machine learning\ntechnologies in use here?"},"4835":{"dur":1,"text":"And if so, how?"},"4837":{"dur":3,"text":"So the answer, AI\nand machine learning,"},"4842":{"dur":3,"text":"they are definitely\nin use here at JPL."},"4845":{"dur":1,"text":"In the robots I\nshowed you here today,"},"4847":{"dur":4,"text":"we're not really doing

hand,"},"4867":{"dur":2,"text":"highlighting these are\ngood places to grip,"},"4869":{"dur":2,"text":"these are bad places to grip,\nand then we're gonna feed"},"4871":{"dur":4,"text":"that into a program that\nwill learn, hopefully,"},"4876":{"dur":4,"text":"from those examples where\nthose good places to grip are."},"4881":{"dur":2,"text":"That's work that's just\ngetting under way now."},"4884":{"dur":2,"text":"But there's a lot more complex\nmachine learning and AI"},"4886":{"dur":3,"text":"that's happening in\nother projects at JPL."},"4890":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'd encourage

technologies."},"4900":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's it, and I'll stick\naround up front if people have-"},"4904":{"dur":1,"text":"well, we'll take one\nmore question, I guess."},"4906":{"dur":0,"text":"- Thank you.\n- Go ahead."},"4907":{"dur":1,"text":"- I appreciate it."},"4909":{"dur":4,"text":"On the ARM project, when you\nbring the boulder off the

go around?"},"4947":{"dur":3,"text":"- Yeah, so after we pull the\nboulder from the asteroid,"},"4951":{"dur":1,"text":"we'll put it in\na, what's called a"},"4952":{"dur":3,"text":"retrograde orbit around the\nMoon, so it's very stable."},"4956":{"dur":4,"text":"And it'll be up there\nfor hundreds of years."},"4960":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, I don't think\nit'll be large

or"},"4973":{"dur":1,"text":"certainly we're going to be\ntalking to the spacecraft,"},"4975":{"dur":2,"text":"but I don't think,\noptically, you're probably"},"4977":{"dur":2,"text":"going to be able to see that."},"4979":{"dur":3,"text":"But that's my 90%\nconfidence answer,"},"4983":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not for sure on that."},"4985":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Man] Put a reflector on
