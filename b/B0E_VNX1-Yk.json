vocabulary of the day."},"417":{"dur":4,"text":"Now I am going to briefly introduce\nthese four basic forms of immortality story"},"422":{"dur":3,"text":"and I want to try to give you some sense \nof the way in which they're retold"},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"by each culture or generation,"},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"using the vocabulary of their day."},"430":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, the first story is the simplest:\nwe want to avoid death."},"436":{"dur":3,"text":"And the dream of doing that in this body,\nin this world, forever,"},"440":{"dur":3,"text":"is the first and simplest kind \nof immortality story."},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"And it might at first sound implausible,"},"445":{"dur":3,"text":"but actually almost every culture\nin human history"},"449":{"dur":4,"text":"has had some myth or legend\nof a elixir of life,"},"453":{"dur":3,"text":"or a fountain of youth or \nsomething that promises"},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"to keep us going forever."},"460":{"dur":3,"text":"Ancient Egypt had such myths, \nancient Babylon, ancient India,"},"464":{"dur":3,"text":"throughout European history,\nwe find them in the work of the alchemists"},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"and of course \nwe still believe this today."},"470":{"dur":3,"text":"Only we tell this story using\nthe vocabulary of science."},"474":{"dur":3,"text":"So a hundred years ago, hormones\nhad just been discovered,"},"478":{"dur":4,"text":"and people hoped that hormone treatments\nwere going to cure aging and disease."},"482":{"dur":4,"text":"And now instead we set our hopes \non stem cells, genetic engineering"},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"and nanotechnology."},"487":{"dur":3,"text":"But the idea that science can cure death"},"491":{"dur":4,"text":"is just one more chapter \nin the story of the magical elixir,"},"495":{"dur":3,"text":"a story that is as old as civilization."},"499":{"dur":3,"text":"But betting everything on the idea \nof finding the elixir"},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"and staying alive forever \nis a risky strategy."},"506":{"dur":1,"text":"When we look back through history"},"508":{"dur":3,"text":"at all those who have sought \nan elixir in the past,"},"511":{"dur":3,"text":"the one thing that they now have\nin common is that they're all dead."},"515":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"516":{"dur":3,"text":"So we need a back up plan, \nand exactly this type of plan B"},"519":{"dur":3,"text":"is what the second kind of\nimmortality story offers,"},"523":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's resurrection."},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's staged with the idea that\nI am this body,"},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"I am this physical organism,"},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"it accepts that I am going to have to die,"},"531":{"dur":3,"text":"but says despite that, I can rise up \nand I can live again."},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"In other words, I can do what Jesus did."},"538":{"dur":3,"text":"Jesus died, he was three days in the tomb \nand he rose up and lived again."},"543":{"dur":4,"text":"And the idea that we can all be resurrected\nto live again is orthodox belief,"},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"not just for Christians \nbut also Jews and Muslims."},"551":{"dur":3,"text":"But our desire to believe this story\nis so deeply embedded"},"554":{"dur":3,"text":"that we are reinventing it again\nfor the scientific age."},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"For example with the idea of cryonics."},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"That's the idea that when you die,\nyou can have yourself frozen,"},"565":{"dur":3,"text":"and then at some point \nwhen technology is advanced enough,"},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"you can be thawed out and repaired \nand revived and so ressurrected."},"572":{"dur":4,"text":"So some people believe an omnipotent God\nwill ressurect them to live again"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"and other people believe \nan omnipotent scientist will do it."},"581":{"dur":3,"text":"But for others, the whole idea \nof ressurection,"},"584":{"dur":4,"text":"of climbing out of the grave,\nis just too much like a bad zombie movie."},"588":{"dur":4,"text":"They find the body too messy, \ntoo unreliable to guarantee eternal life."},"593":{"dur":5,"text":"And so they set their hopes on the third \nmore spiritual immortality story,"},"598":{"dur":4,"text":"the idea we can leave our body behind \nand live on as a soul."},"603":{"dur":3,"text":"Now the majority of people on Earth \nbelieve they have a soul"},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"and the idea is central to many religions."},"609":{"dur":4,"text":"But even though in its current form \nand its traditional form,"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"the idea of the soul is still hugely popular,"},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"nonetheless we are again reinventing it \nfor the digital age."},"619":{"dur":3,"text":"For example, with the idea \nthat you can leave your body behind"},"623":{"dur":4,"text":"by uploading your mind, your essence, \nthe real you, onto a computer."},"627":{"dur":3,"text":"and so live on as an avatar in the ether."},"632":{"dur":3,"text":"But of course there are skeptics who say\nif we look at the evidence of science,"},"635":{"dur":5,"text":"particularly neuroscience, it suggests \nthat your mind, your essence, the real you,"},"641":{"dur":3,"text":"is very much dependant \non a particular part of your body"},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"that is your brain."},"645":{"dur":4,"text":"And such skeptics can find comfort \nin the fourth kind of immortality story,"},"650":{"dur":1,"text":"and that is legacy."},"652":{"dur":4,"text":"The idea that you can live on\nthrough the echo you leave in the world."},"656":{"dur":4,"text":"Like the great Greek warrior Achilies, \nwho sacrificed his life fighting at Troy"},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"so that he might win immortal fame."},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"And the pursuit of fame is \nas widespread and popular now"},"667":{"dur":1,"text":"as it ever was."},"668":{"dur":3,"text":"And in our digital age, \nit's even easier to achieve."},"672":{"dur":3,"text":"You don't need to be a great warrior \nlike Achilies or a great king or hero,"},"675":{"dur":3,"text":"all you need is an internet connection \nand a funny cat."},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"(Laughter)"},"681":{"dur":3,"text":"But some people prefer to leave\na more tangible, biological legacy,"},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"children for example."},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"Or they like, they hope, to live on \nas part of some greater whole"},"689":{"dur":3,"text":"a nation, or family, or tribe,\ntheir gene pool."},"695":{"dur":4,"text":"But again there are skeptics, who doubt \nwhether legacy really is immortality."},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"Woody Allen for example, who said,"},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"\"I dont want to live on \nin the hearts of my countrymen,"},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"I want to live on in my apartment\"."},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"708":{"dur":1,"text":"And if you want to live on \nin your apartment"},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"you need a elixir of course."},"711":{"dur":3,"text":"Which was our first kind\nof immortality story."},"715":{"dur":3,"text":"So those are the four basic kinds\nof immortality stories"},"719":{"dur":4,"text":"and I've tried to give just some sense\nof how they're retold by each generation,"},"723":{"dur":3,"text":"with just slight variations \nto fit the fashions of the day."},"726":{"dur":5,"text":"And the fact that they reccur in this way,\nin such a similar form"},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"but in such different belief systems,\nsuggests I think"},"734":{"dur":1,"text":"that we should be skeptical"},"736":{"dur":4,"text":"of the truth of any particular version \nof these stories."},"741":{"dur":1,"text":"The fact that some people believe"},"743":{"dur":3,"text":"an omnipotent God \nwill ressurrect them to live again,"},"746":{"dur":3,"text":"and others believe \nan omnipotent scientist will do it,"},"749":{"dur":5,"text":"suggests that neither are really believing\nthis on the strength of the evidence."},"754":{"dur":5,"text":"Rather we believe these stories because \nwe are biased to believe them,"},"759":{"dur":4,"text":"and we are bias to believe them because \nwe are so afraid of death."},"765":{"dur":5,"text":"So the question is, are we doomed \nto lead the one life we have"},"771":{"dur":4,"text":"in a way that is shaped\nby fear and denial?"},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"Or can we overcome this bias?"},"777":{"dur":4,"text":"Well the Greek philosopher Epicurus\nthought we could."},"782":{"dur":6,"text":"He argued that the fear of death\nis natural but it is not rational."},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"Death, he said, is nothing to us,"},"791":{"dur":2,"text":"because when we are here, death is not,"},"794":{"dur":2,"text":"and when death is here, we are gone."},"798":{"dur":4,"text":"Now this is often quoted but it's difficult \nto really grasp, to really internalise,"},"802":{"dur":3,"text":"because exactly this idea of being gone \nis so difficult to imagine."},"807":{"dur":3,"text":"So two thousand years later \nanother philosopher, Ludovic Wittgenstein,"},"810":{"dur":1,"text":"put it like this:"},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"death is not an event in life,"},"815":{"dur":3,"text":"we do not live\nto experience death."},"818":{"dur":3,"text":"And so he added, in this sense \nlife has no end."},"823":{"dur":5,"text":"So it was natural for me as a child\nto fear being swallowed by the void,"},"828":{"dur":4,"text":"but it wasn't rational, because \nbeing swallowed by the void"},"832":{"dur":4,"text":"is not something that any of us \nwill ever live to experience."},"838":{"dur":2,"text":"Now overcoming this bias is not easy"},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"because the fear of death is \nso deeply embedded in us."},"843":{"dur":4,"text":"Yet when we see that \nthe fear itself is not rational"},"847":{"dur":3,"text":"and when we bring out into the open"},"850":{"dur":2,"text":"the ways in which \nit can unconsciously bias us,"},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"then we can at least start to try"},"855":{"dur":3,"text":"to minimize the influence\nit has on our lives."},"858":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, I find it helps to see life \nas being like a book."},"863":{"dur":3,"text":"Just as a book is bounded by its covers,\nby beginning and end,"},"867":{"dur":3,"text":"so our lives are bounded \nby birth and death."},"870":{"dur":4,"text":"And even though a book\nis limited by beginning and end,"},"874":{"dur":5,"text":"it can encompass distant landscapes, \nexotic figures, fantastic adventures."},"879":{"dur":4,"text":"And even though a book is limited\nby beginning and end,"},"883":{"dur":3,"text":"the characters within it \nknow no horizons."},"887":{"dur":3,"text":"They only know the moments\nthat make up their story,"},"891":{"dur":1,"text":"even when the book is closed."},"894":{"dur":5,"text":"And so the characters of the book \nare not afraid of reaching the last page."},"899":{"dur":4,"text":"Long John Silver is not afraid of you\nfinishing your copy of Treasure Island."},"904":{"dur":2,"text":"And so it should be with us."},"906":{"dur":3,"text":"Imagine the book of your life, its covers,"},"909":{"dur":2,"text":"its beginning and end \nare your birth and your death."},"912":{"dur":2,"text":"You can only know\nthe moments in between,"},"914":{"dur":1,"text":"the moments that make up your life."},"916":{"dur":3,"text":"It makes no sense for you to fear\nwhat is outside of those covers,"},"919":{"dur":2,"text":"whether before your birth, \nor after your death."},"922":{"dur":3,"text":"And you needn't worry \nhow long the book is,"},"926":{"dur":2,"text":"or whether it's a
