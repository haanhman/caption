the answer, interestingly enough,"},"1245":{"dur":3,"text":"is not something typically highlighted or even mentioned"},"1248":{"dur":2,"text":"in most discussions of our Constitution

as the title of this talk suggests"},"1259":{"dur":2,"text":"a willingness to deliberate, to negotiate"},"1262":{"dur":3,"text":"and, ultimately to compromise with others who disagree."},"1265":{"dur":1,"text":"So that, I want to say, is"},"1267":{"dur":2,"text":"a fundamental obligation and responsibility"},"1269":{"dur":3,"text":"of both citizens and their

might, it should, it does,"},"1287":{"dur":1,"text":"usually to lawyers and law students"},"1289":{"dur":2,"text":"because deliberation has always attracted some attention"},"1292":{"dur":1,"text":"in

claim."},"1306":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not sure why that's so."},"1307":{"dur":1,"text":"I'd like to think it's because their importance is"},"1309":{"dur":2,"text":"so obvious it's been taken for

it's, I think,"},"1319":{"dur":2,"text":"a relatively straightforward, but important, exercise"},"1321":{"dur":2,"text":"to demonstrate the significance and centrality"},"1324":{"dur":3,"text":"of negotiation and compromise in our Constitutional scheme."},"1327":{"dur":3,"text":"So, this is the detailed historical part."},"1332":{"dur":1,"text":"So, we start with a reminder"},"1333":{"dur":2,"text":"that the heart of republicanism and republican government"},"1336":{"dur":1,"text":"is popular control, right,"},"1337":{"dur":3,"text":"the idea that, again, most, I'll use mostly Madison's words."},"1341":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Power is in the people over the government"},"1343":{"dur":2,"text":"\"and not in the government over the people"},"1345":{"dur":2,"text":"\"and that public opinion is the real sovereign"},"1348":{"dur":1,"text":"\"in every free government.\""},"1350":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, that much I think is uncontroversial."},"1352":{"dur":2,"text":"Less obvious, but equally important, is the proposition"},"1355":{"dur":3,"text":"that popular control means majority rule,"},"1358":{"dur":2,"text":"that our Constitution is a majoritarian Constitution,"},"1361":{"dur":2,"text":"not a counter-majoritarian Constitution,"},"1364":{"dur":2,"text":"that to be republican requires"},"1366":{"dur":2,"text":"that the will of the majority govern"},"1369":{"dur":1,"text":"and this is a point,"},"1370":{"dur":2,"text":"it's a point that is like completely,"},"1372":{"dur":4,"text":"and certainly in law schools, lost or rejected more often."},"1377":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, we were taught"},"1378":{"dur":1,"text":"it's counter-majoritarian, the Constitution,"},"1379":{"dur":3,"text":"language itself coming from the 1950s or so."},"1383":{"dur":1,"text":"But, in fact, if you go back and you look,"},"1385":{"dur":2,"text":"the idea that republican government meant majority rule,"},"1388":{"dur":2,"text":"it's something that is stated over and over and over again"},"1390":{"dur":1,"text":"by all of the Founders."},"1392":{"dur":2,"text":"Madison wrote in the Vices Memo, for example,"},"1395":{"dur":2,"text":"that, \"In a republic, not only does the majority,"},"1397":{"dur":1,"text":"\"however composed, ultimately give the law,"},"1399":{"dur":2,"text":"\"but this indeed is the fundamental principle"},"1401":{"dur":2,"text":"\"of republican government,\" and that, of course, gives rise"},"1404":{"dur":1,"text":"to the problem, right,"},"1406":{"dur":1,"text":"or what I think you can say is the problem"},"1408":{"dur":2,"text":"because of the sad lesson of the 1780s, was"},"1410":{"dur":4,"text":"that popular majorities were often unjust and unreasonable."},"1415":{"dur":4,"text":"And yet, and that, people are really willing to accept that,"},"1420":{"dur":3,"text":"yeah, God, majority rule, what a nightmare, right?"},"1423":{"dur":3,"text":"And yet, you know, the people who fought the Revolution"},"1427":{"dur":3,"text":"hadn't dedicated their lives to the cause of republicanism"},"1430":{"dur":3,"text":"without regard for its quality or content."},"1433":{"dur":4,"text":"So, to be republican, it had to rest on majority rule"},"1438":{"dur":2,"text":"and, of course, a republican government could be just"},"1440":{"dur":2,"text":"but it didn't have to be"},"1442":{"dur":2,"text":"and an unjust government, even if republican,"},"1444":{"dur":2,"text":"wouldn't be worth serving or preserving."},"1447":{"dur":2,"text":"So, while republicanism meant subjecting"},"1449":{"dur":2,"text":"the will of the government to the will of society,"},"1452":{"dur":1,"text":"meaning the will of the majority,"},"1454":{"dur":2,"text":"that alone wasn't enough, right;"},"1456":{"dur":1,"text":"it was necessary, as well,"},"1457":{"dur":2,"text":"to subject the will of the society"},"1459":{"dur":2,"text":"to the reason of the society."},"1463":{"dur":2,"text":"In promoting the authority of public opinion,"},"1465":{"dur":2,"text":"in other words, Madison is preaching majority rule,"},"1468":{"dur":2,"text":"but not simple majoritarianism."},"1470":{"dur":2,"text":"Majority opinion, would hold sway,"},"1473":{"dur":2,"text":"but the majority opinion that should hold sway"},"1475":{"dur":2,"text":"has to be more than the unreflective reactions"},"1478":{"dur":1,"text":"of a transient majority of the citizens."},"1480":{"dur":4,"text":"It has to reflect the true interests of the society."},"1484":{"dur":2,"text":"Jefferson makes the same point as well, again,"},"1486":{"dur":2,"text":"quoting from his first Inaugural address, he says,"},"1488":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Americans should bear in mind the sacred principle"},"1491":{"dur":1,"text":"\"that

course, that is, there is the real problem, right,"},"1502":{"dur":1,"text":"'cause ensuring that the will of the majority is"},"1504":{"dur":2,"text":"gonna be reasonable is not an easy task."},"1506":{"dur":1,"text":"How do you do that, right?"},"1507":{"dur":2,"text":"How do you keep, again, both sides visible?"},"1510":{"dur":1,"text":"How do you ensure the

constitutional democracy not an oxymoron?"},"1530":{"dur":0,"text":"Now,"},"1534":{"dur":3,"text":"you start with, well, let's start with one point"},"1537":{"dur":2,"text":"which is there's no surefire way to guarantee"},"1540":{"dur":1,"text":"that every decision the government makes"},"1541":{"dur":2,"text":"is gonna meet that standard,"},"1544":{"dur":1,"text":"that every time the government acts,"},"1546":{"dur":2,"text":"it's going to be something that is, in fact,"},"1548":{"dur":1,"text":"reflects the true interests of the society."},"1550":{"dur":1,"text":"But, you know, that's going to be true"},"1551":{"dur":3,"text":"for any system of governance, right?"},"1554":{"dur":2,"text":"Now to say, the most we can ever do is build a system"},"1557":{"dur":2,"text":"we think likely to achieve such outcomes"},"1559":{"dur":1,"text":"as often as possible"},"1561":{"dur":2,"text":"and in the American context, it's we need to build a system"},"1563":{"dur":1,"text":"that's likely to achieve those outcomes"},"1565":{"dur":3,"text":"as often as possible and that is republican"},"1569":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's the task Madison"},"1570":{"dur":2,"text":"and the other Framers set for themselves in Philadelphia."},"1573":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay, first principle,"},"1575":{"dur":3,"text":"one Madison gleaned from his own study of history, is"},"1578":{"dur":1,"text":"that popular government will succeed"},"1579":{"dur":3,"text":"only if decision-making is mediated and refined"},"1583":{"dur":3,"text":"through a system of accountable representation."},"1587":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay, now, that was a given, right,"},"1589":{"dur":1,"text":"though, to say that law-making would be done"},"1590":{"dur":1,"text":"by representative legislatures"},"1592":{"dur":2,"text":"was never in question, if only because, you know,"},"1595":{"dur":2,"text":"more direct forms of democracy were impractical"},"1597":{"dur":2,"text":"on the national level or even on the state level."},"1600":{"dur":1,"text":"There were, however, at the time,"},"1602":{"dur":3,"text":"very different views about

operate."},"1610":{"dur":1,"text":"So, a lot of Anti-Federalists"},"1612":{"dur":2,"text":"and even some Federalists viewed representation"},"1615":{"dur":2,"text":"as an inferior second-best to

anyone"},"2116":{"dur":2,"text":"in the Founding generation would have thought, right."},"2119":{"dur":3,"text":"That's a 1950s conception of democratic politics"},"2123":{"dur":1,"text":"and one that was completely alien"},"2125":{"dur":2,"text":"to the Founding generation, you know,"},"2128":{"dur":3,"text":"which viewed interest groups as inevitable"},"2131":{"dur":2,"text":"but as an evil to be overcome,"},"2134":{"dur":2,"text":"that is, to say the idea of the political system is"},"2137":{"dur":4,"text":"to transcend self-interest, not to give it free play."},"2141":{"dur":1,"text":"The same scholars, by the way,"},"2142":{"dur":3,"text":"who have sort of repudiated the pluralist vision of Madison"},"2145":{"dur":3,"text":"offer the alternative reading, the one that is, I

predominant one today."},"2179":{"dur":2,"text":"First, it's way too anti-democratic."},"2182":{"dur":2,"text":"There's no question that Madison had anxiety"},"2184":{"dur":2,"text":"about the risks

people,\""},"2208":{"dur":2,"text":"again his language, is what we're trying to secure."},"2211":{"dur":2,"text":"Madison's whole purpose was"},"2214":{"dur":1,"text":"to make democratic politics work,"},"2216":{"dur":1,"text":"not to minimize the extent to which"},"2217":{"dur":3,"text":"it would interfere with the ruling elite."},"2220":{"dur":3,"text":"Madison was, above all, like all of

home"},"2376":{"dur":1,"text":"after he gets, he gets to the Congress,"},"2378":{"dur":1,"text":"he's Speaker of the House,"},"2379":{"dur":1,"text":"and he writes home all these letters."},"2380":{"dur":2,"text":"He's so disappointed in the quality of the Representatives;"},"2383":{"dur":2,"text":"it's so much less than he hoped."},"2385":{"dur":0,"text":"In any rate, you know,"},"2386":{"dur":1,"text":"he had been at the Philadelphia Convention"},"2388":{"dur":1,"text":"and, you know, the Convention was filled"},"2389":{"dur":1,"text":"with disagreement and self-interest"},"2391":{"dur":3,"text":"and the grudging resolution of real controversy"},"2396":{"dur":2,"text":"by close votes after angry debates, right,"},"2399":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, so, in fact, were it not for the willingness"},"2401":{"dur":2,"text":"of the delegates in Philadelphia to compromise,"},"2404":{"dur":1,"text":"even on matters of high

be able"},"2416":{"dur":2,"text":"to operate in secret the way the Convention had"},"2418":{"dur":1,"text":"and they were gonna be exposed"},"2420":{"dur":2,"text":"to their constituents at all times."},"2422":{"dur":2,"text":"So, you know, Madison is a realist"},"2425":{"dur":1,"text":"and someone who learned from experience"},"2427":{"dur":3,"text":"and by 1787, he had a lot of experience"},"2430":{"dur":2,"text":"with legislative assemblies at the best and at their worst"},"2433":{"dur":1,"text":"and that had to have informed his understanding"},"2434":{"dur":2,"text":"and expectations for the new Federal Congress."},"2437":{"dur":2,"text":"So, how did he expect Congress to work?"},"2439":{"dur":1,"text":"I think Madison scholars are clearly right"},"2441":{"dur":1,"text":"to reject the pluralist view,"},"2443":{"dur":2,"text":"but the alternative to pluralism doesn't have to be"},"2445":{"dur":4,"text":"some idealized philosopher's club

rise above self-interest"},"2457":{"dur":3,"text":"and think about the greater public good, but he understood"},"2460":{"dur":3,"text":"that how people saw the public good would

people saw the public good, in other words,"},"2472":{"dur":2,"text":"would inevitably be shaped by their situation"},"2475":{"dur":2,"text":"and by their self-interests"},"2477":{"dur":2,"text":"and the whole point in extending the Republic"},"2479":{"dur":4,"text":"was to encompass people from a wider variety of situations"},"2483":{"dur":2,"text":"and so take in a greater number of interests"},"2486":{"dur":3,"text":"and the resulting diversity of viewpoints was itself"},"2489":{"dur":2,"text":"something that would both slow down and improve"},"2491":{"dur":2,"text":"the process of majority formation,"},"2493":{"dur":3,"text":"precisely because it would require a complex process"},"2497":{"dur":1,"text":"of negotiation and compromise,"},"2498":{"dur":3,"text":"the same process Madison had witnessed in Philadelphia,"},"2502":{"dur":1,"text":"although, again, more complicated"},"2503":{"dur":2,"text":"because the members of Congress couldn't work in

right, as Madison explained"},"2520":{"dur":1,"text":"in Federalist 51."},"2521":{"dur":2,"text":"We would divide it, first, between two distinct governments,"},"2524":{"dur":2,"text":"state government and Federal Governments,"},"2526":{"dur":3,"text":"and then the portion allotted to each of those levels"},"2529":{"dur":4,"text":"would be subdivided among distinct and separate departments."},"2533":{"dur":1,"text":"So, all these different branches"},"2534":{"dur":2,"text":"and departments of government, governors,"},"2537":{"dur":2,"text":"houses of representatives, senates,"},"2539":{"dur":2,"text":"at the different levels and so on,"},"2541":{"dur":1,"text":"could then use their powers"},"2543":{"dur":4,"text":"to impede actions by the others if they disagreed

kind of public debate"},"2555":{"dur":2,"text":"that was necessary for the reason of the society"},"2557":{"dur":1,"text":"to emerge and coalesce."},"2559":{"dur":0,"text":"And, this is also, let me take"},"2560":{"dur":3,"text":"a second important point to emphasize."},"2563":{"dur":1,"text":"The House passes a bill."},"2565":{"dur":2,"text":"They say, it's a good law; it's a constitutional law."},"2568":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, the Senate disagrees, so now it doesn't become a law."},"2571":{"dur":1,"text":"The way this is often taught is,"},"2573":{"dur":2,"text":"yeah, so there's the institutional check."},"2575":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, there's so many things wring with that argument."},"2577":{"dur":2,"text":"First of all, we know for sure that members of,"},"2579":{"dur":2,"text":"politicians are perfectly willing to trade off"},"2582":{"dur":2,"text":"the interests of their institution"},"2584":{"dur":3,"text":"for their political interests, so the idea that this is"},"2588":{"dur":2,"text":"what protects the branches of the government"},"2590":{"dur":1,"text":"against each other doesn't make sense."},"2592":{"dur":2,"text":"We see this all the time, right?"},"2595":{"dur":1,"text":"If you have a democratic Congress,"},"2596":{"dur":2,"text":"they will give the President all sorts of powers,"},"2599":{"dur":2,"text":"even if it weakens the power of Congress"},"2601":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's just common."},"2603":{"dur":1,"text":"That's what you can count on politicians to do."},"2604":{"dur":1,"text":"What Madison is thinking is,"},"2606":{"dur":2,"text":"the interests, what he says in Federalist 51,"},"2609":{"dur":2,"text":"\"the interests of the man should be united"},"2611":{"dur":3,"text":"\"with the Constitutional powers of the department.\""},"2615":{"dur":1,"text":"The interests of the man are political interests."},"2617":{"dur":1,"text":"So, the way this works, the House passes this law,"},"2618":{"dur":1,"text":"the Senate disagrees."},"2621":{"dur":2,"text":"The members of the House are gonna go back"},"2623":{"dur":2,"text":"to their constituents and say, \"This is a good law,"},"2625":{"dur":0,"text":"\"it's constitutional law."},"2626":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Put pressure on them to pass it,\""},"2628":{"dur":1,"text":"and the Senators aren't sitting passively doing nothing,"},"2630":{"dur":1,"text":"so they're going back to the same constituents,"},"2632":{"dur":2,"text":"making the same arguments and, at some point,"},"2634":{"dur":2,"text":"the public is gonna come down on one side or the other"},"2637":{"dur":1,"text":"and the only assumption Madison"},"2638":{"dur":1,"text":"and the other Framers are making is"},"2640":{"dur":2,"text":"that whichever side the public comes down on,"},"2642":{"dur":2,"text":"the branch that's on the opposite side of that will relent"},"2645":{"dur":1,"text":"and that actually tends to be

there can be a library so they can write opinions,"},"4286":{"dur":1,"text":"all sorts of changes, okay."},"4288":{"dur":2,"text":"By the time the Jacksonians are on, they don't like this."},"4290":{"dur":1,"text":"They want to take control back"},"4292":{"dur":1,"text":"and give it back to the people."},"4293":{"dur":2,"text":"Their first move is through codification,

we have popular control of the law."},"4303":{"dur":1,"text":"They don't get very far on that"},"4304":{"dur":1,"text":"for all sorts of complicated reasons,"},"4306":{"dur":3,"text":"so their next

judges"},"4314":{"dur":1,"text":"to the popular control of the people"},"4315":{"dur":2,"text":"and it actually works quite well, at first."},"4318":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, one of the interesting things about this is"},"4321":{"dur":1,"text":"this is where judicial review becomes"},"4323":{"dur":2,"text":"a widely-accepted practice,"},"4325":{"dur":3,"text":"so they do it at the federal level in 1803."},"4328":{"dur":1,"text":"There's a fair amount of it in the 1790s"},"4330":{"dur":1,"text":"and then you get Marbury in 1803 where,"},"4332":{"dur":1,"text":"and then it really disappears"},"4333":{"dur":2,"text":"from federal courts for a long time,"},"4335":{"dur":2,"text":"but where it grows is in the state courts"},"4338":{"dur":2,"text":"in the 1840s and 50s, after the

recognize"},"4402":{"dur":4,"text":"that we have special constitutional courts, right,"},"4406":{"dur":1,"text":"so most of our courts are civil service,"},"4408":{"dur":3,"text":"but constitutional law, that's political, so we pull it out,"},"4411":{"dur":2,"text":"we put it in a special constitutional court"},"4413":{"dur":1,"text":"and unlike the judges in the regular

gonna do?"},"4496":{"dur":1,"text":"How are we gonna control the Court?"},"4497":{"dur":1,"text":"We know how we can control the other branches,"},"4498":{"dur":2,"text":"we can vote them out, but

is"},"4538":{"dur":2,"text":"once those powers are available, and known to be available,"},"4540":{"dur":1,"text":"you seldom need to use them"},"4542":{"dur":1,"text":"because Courts are pretty respectful,"},"4544":{"dur":2,"text":"nor is it easy to use them if you're an executive,"},"4547":{"dur":1,"text":"but they have been used, right."},"4548":{"dur":3,"text":"Jefferson redid the rules

can protest all you want,"},"4598":{"dur":1,"text":"but the only way you can change it"},"4600":{"dur":3,"text":"is either to get them to change their minds"},"4603":{"dur":2,"text":"or wait for some
