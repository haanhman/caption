a"},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"partnership with\nthe inventor to get"},"372":{"dur":1,"text":"that idea to the marketplace."},"374":{"dur":1,"text":"And then, so that's one element."},"375":{"dur":1,"text":"Hiring entrepreneurs\nin residence"},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"and colleges and campuses."},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"And another idea is actually\nto put money on the
