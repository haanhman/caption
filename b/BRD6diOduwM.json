small"},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"projects?\u201d"},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"And initially my first instinct was data entry."},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"Something very simple."},"512":{"dur":4,"text":"I had a lot of friends who were entrepreneurs\nor involved in startups in Silicon Valley"},"516":{"dur":4,"text":"that needed basic data processing like, you\nknow, we\u2019ve collected all these receipts"},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"and we need them scanned and entered into\na spreadsheet, that sort of thing."},"524":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah."},"525":{"dur":3,"text":"And so it\u2019s straightforward enough that\nI could actually be the person to secure the"},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"work and do the quality assurance."},"531":{"dur":4,"text":"So the first money I spent going to Kenya,\nidentifying

operation\nuntil I literally could not do that anymore"},"544":{"dur":2,"text":"and\u2026 and then I got to work."},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"So I spent the money also on software."},"550":{"dur":4,"text":"I found a software platform that would let\nme load these projects and manage them myself,"},"555":{"dur":4,"text":"and then I went around to every entrepreneur\nI knew who might need these types of services,"},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"I made a brochure on my Mac, printed it out\nat Kinko\u2019s\u2026"},"563":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes!"},"564":{"dur":4,"text":"...and I got our first contract in September\nof 2008, which is the month we started officially"},"568":{"dur":1,"text":"the business."},"569":{"dur":6,"text":"A friend of mine who is running a large

haven\u2019t\u2026"},"639":{"dur":4,"text":"I\u2019ve done so much research and I love what\nyou do and I haven\u2019t heard that, so genius."},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"Talk to us about impact

new term that refers\nto making sourcing decisions in your business,"},"656":{"dur":5,"text":"or at least part of them, based around social\nimpact in addition to quality."},"661":{"dur":4,"text":"So the idea is, you know, we have all of these\nproblems around the world, global poverty"},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"and domestic poverty being one of them."},"669":{"dur":6,"text":"One way to solve those problems is to deliberately\nwork with enterprises that have a social or"},"676":{"dur":1,"text":"environmental mission."},"677":{"dur":5,"text":"And thus you can use the\u2026 the budget that\nyou have allocated in your business to address"},"682":{"dur":4,"text":"these social problems rather than trying to\nmaximize your profit and then donating it"},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"at the end to a charity."},"690":{"dur":5,"text":"And this is a way of thinking that actually\nhas a long history here in the United States."},"695":{"dur":4,"text":"One of my favorite examples is Goodwill Industries."},"699":{"dur":3,"text":"Most people think of Goodwill as a nice charity\nand they donate their clothes."},"703":{"dur":5,"text":"Goodwill actually earns 3 billion dollars\nglobally in store revenue from all of their"},"708":{"dur":1,"text":"stores globally."},"710":{"dur":6,"text":"And all of that store revenue comes from employing\nmarginalized people in the store in addition"},"716":{"dur":3,"text":"to recycling donated clothing."},"719":{"dur":5,"text":"And Goodwill also offers services for offices\nthat want to\u2026 that want to move and have"},"725":{"dur":4,"text":"a large number of items they need picked up\nand recycled, or I think they also offer setup"},"730":{"dur":1,"text":"services for corporate events."},"732":{"dur":5,"text":"So if you are the procurement manager in a\ncompany or you\u2019re running an event, you"},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"have a choice as to what vendors you choose."},"739":{"dur":4,"text":"And the idea of impact sourcing is that you\u2026\nyou deliberately choose vendors, and maybe"},"744":{"dur":4,"text":"not for everything that you, you know, need\nto source, but maybe for some percentage of"},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"your sourcing needs, that have an overt social\nmission."},"752":{"dur":5,"text":"And the other idea of impact sourcing is that\nyou needn\u2019t compromise on quality to have"},"758":{"dur":1,"text":"that social impact."},"760":{"dur":5,"text":"So I was just on a panel yesterday with the\nCEO of Glass Door, which is a technology company"},"765":{"dur":4,"text":"that lets employees rate their employers and\nprovide more transparency in the workplace."},"770":{"dur":2,"text":"They now have about 600 employees."},"772":{"dur":4,"text":"And I met him just before the panel, 30 minutes\nbefore, and he said, \u201cI had no idea that"},"777":{"dur":1,"text":"SamaSource was a nonprofit.\u201d"},"778":{"dur":3,"text":"I was telling him about some of the fundraising\nchallenges I had."},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"And he was kind of blown away and he said,\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working with you\u2026\u201d they"},"784":{"dur":3,"text":"now have about 85 workers who are SamaSource\nworkers globally."},"787":{"dur":4,"text":"He said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been working with you\nfor over a year and nobody on my team ever"},"791":{"dur":1,"text":"said, \u2018These guys are a nonprofit.\u2019"},"792":{"dur":4,"text":"I just thought you were the best quality service\nwe could find.\u201d"},"797":{"dur":3,"text":"And so\u2026 so that\u2019s a wonderful story and\nI do wanna tell people we\u2019re a nonprofit"},"800":{"dur":4,"text":"because I think it helps them understand that\nif we do ever make a profit on this kind of"},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"work it will all be reinvested in our work\nand none of us are doing this for personal"},"809":{"dur":1,"text":"gain."},"810":{"dur":2,"text":"We can\u2019t, by law."},"812":{"dur":5,"text":"And I think the model of impact sourcing that\u2019s\nso interesting is that by hiring SamaSource,"},"818":{"dur":4,"text":"Glass Door is directly contributing to the\nsame kind of poverty alleviation that we would"},"822":{"dur":3,"text":"normally be paying for with aid or charitable\ndollars."},"826":{"dur":6,"text":"So, you know, in the prior model, Americans\nwork hard, we get taxed, some percentage of"},"832":{"dur":5,"text":"our income through that tax goes to USAID,\nour agency for international development,"},"837":{"dur":5,"text":"and then that organization hires people to\nadminister programs overseas that theoretically"},"843":{"dur":2,"text":"help the people that we\u2019re helping on this\nproject."},"845":{"dur":1,"text":"Theoretically."},"846":{"dur":1,"text":"Theoretically."},"847":{"dur":1,"text":"Right?"},"848":{"dur":1,"text":"Exactly."},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"And, you know, and I think these agencies\ndo a lot of good but I think it\u2019s really"},"851":{"dur":4,"text":"interesting to imagine other ways of addressing\nthat same population and if we can

problems."},"865":{"dur":4,"text":"The thing I love about impact sourcing, you\nknow, I hadn\u2019t heard that turn of phrase"},"869":{"dur":5,"text":"before, but through my lens it\u2019s

it?"},"916":{"dur":4,"text":"I\u2019m so glad that you asked that because\nI think one of the challenges that the nonprofit"},"921":{"dur":3,"text":"sector faces is the perception that we\u2019re\nnot efficient."},"924":{"dur":4,"text":"And coming from the private sector myself\nI also had that bias when I came in."},"928":{"dur":5,"text":"I saw lots of aid organizations on the ground\nin Africa

efficient.\u201d"},"939":{"dur":5,"text":"I think part of the challenge is that in the\nprivate sector we have this unifying measure"},"945":{"dur":3,"text":"of success, which is profit measured in
