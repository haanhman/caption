there."},"719":{"dur":6,"text":"Add the handle into place, just poking the\nspaghetti into the top of the cake."},"725":{"dur":4,"text":"Now I just realized we can't get any water\ninto our watering

it, I don't do it twice."},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"So sometimes I need to do a little correction\nas I go."},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"But you can do it the right way first time\nwhen you make it."},"751":{"dur":6,"text":"Now that we've fixed that, add a little water\non the side and the handle into place"},"757":{"dur":2,"text":"And push some spaghetti through to support\nit."},"760":{"dur":4,"text":"And then add something to hold that up while\nthe water dries."},"764":{"dur":5,"text":"Then roll a little ball of fondant and add\nit over the top of the

seconds."},"785":{"dur":4,"text":"Stir it well, then microwave for 30 seconds."},"789":{"dur":4,"text":"And now it should be really melted so keep\nstirring just to incorporate the cream

thicken"},"801":{"dur":5,"text":"as it cools so quickly add the coconut and\nthis is going to make it look like grass."},"806":{"dur":5,"text":"This will be easier it you do it in sections\nuntil the whole board is covered so the ganache"},"811":{"dur":2,"text":"doesn't set before you've added the coconut."},"814":{"dur":6,"text":"For the water take some isomalt crystals and\nheat them over high heat until they are melted."},"821":{"dur":4,"text":"And then pour spoonfuls onto non-stick baking\npaper making long drips."},"826":{"dur":4,"text":"Now this is super, super hot so do not touch\nit."},"830":{"dur":5,"text":"Remove the supports from watering can and\nadd some drips of isomalt around the rod using"},"835":{"dur":3,"text":"some of the melted isomalt to make it stick."},"838":{"dur":3,"text":"Continue adding more drips coming from the\nholes in the nozzle."},"842":{"dur":2,"text":"Just like water dripping down."},"845":{"dur":6,"text":"Then add your little plant and use isomalt\njust to make those leaves stick on instantly"},"851":{"dur":1,"text":"for you."},"852":{"dur":4,"text":"And the watering can just seems to hang in\nmid-air above the plant, which makes it a"},"856":{"dur":1,"text":"pretty impressive looking cake."},"858":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay and now to play the game."},"860":{"dur":6,"text":"I'm on level 51 but I'm going to go back to\nlevel 16 so that I can show you one of the"},"867":{"dur":4,"text":"new things which we have, which is wind and\nthe acorns, or the nuts and the squirrels"},"872":{"dur":1,"text":"have to get the acorns."},"873":{"dur":4,"text":"So what happens with the wind is if you join\nthree together, just like you do in any of"},"877":{"dur":4,"text":"these sort of slide games, usually everything\nfalls down from the top."},"882":{"dur":2,"text":"But in this one it doesn't necessarily do\nthat."},"884":{"dur":2,"text":"It will fall the way that you have swiped."},"887":{"dur":4,"text":"See there we have a line of 2 pairs and I'll\nmove the third one across and everything,"},"892":{"dur":5,"text":"all the little cropsies, fill up from the\nside so depending which way you've swiped,"},"897":{"dur":1,"text":"depends which way everything will up from."},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"So if I swipe up from the bottom on the water\nhere, you'll see the cropsies come up from"},"901":{"dur":5,"text":"the bottom instead of from the side."},"906":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's one new thing."},"908":{"dur":4,"text":"The other thing is with the squirrel and the\nacorn, to get them together you need to get"},"912":{"dur":1,"text":"rid of the stuff that's in between the two\nof them."},"914":{"dur":3,"text":"So if we swipe down with that plum, that will\nmove the squirrel closer and he swishes his"},"917":{"dur":2,"text":"tail and gets rid of the acorn."},"920":{"dur":5,"text":"So that's quite easy for you to do."},"925":{"dur":2,"text":"The one thing I do like about this game as\nwell is that once you've finished a level,"},"927":{"dur":2,"text":"if you still have moves left, you get to use\nthose."},"930":{"dur":1,"text":"So that helps you get extra points."},"932":{"dur":5,"text":"So you see up in the top corner you've got\nstars and by getting our extra moves and using"},"937":{"dur":2,"text":"them, we can fill up those stars."},"939":{"dur":4,"text":"And the more stars you get the better your\nlittle plant grows for the country fair, so"},"944":{"dur":2,"text":"then you get extra points and things for doing\nthat."},"946":{"dur":5,"text":"So we'll do that one and finish up that level\nbecause we've used up all our moves there."},"951":{"dur":1,"text":"Awesome, level completed."},"952":{"dur":4,"text":"And now I want to show you level 43 which\nthe reason I want to show you this one is"},"957":{"dur":1,"text":"this one has hay and a little goat."},"958":{"dur":5,"text":"And what you've got to do is get the goat\nto eat the hay in order to get rid of enough"},"964":{"dur":1,"text":"of them to fill up the top."},"965":{"dur":2,"text":"Now this one took me a little while to figure\nout."},"968":{"dur":4,"text":"What you have to do basically to get the goat\nto move is you don't have to make a match"},"972":{"dur":4,"text":"right next to it, well you can do that but\nit's only going ot move one space if you do"},"977":{"dur":1,"text":"do that."},"978":{"dur":4,"text":"You're better off making a match as far away\nalong the line from the goat as you can."},"983":{"dur":4,"text":"So we'll match up these pears and you'll see\nit will go all the way across to where we"},"987":{"dur":2,"text":"made the match, so that got rid of two hay\nbales."},"989":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you match right next to it, it's only\ngoing to move one."},"993":{"dur":4,"text":"Now we need it to move up or down a level,\nwe can't really do that right now, so we're"},"997":{"dur":3,"text":"just concentrating on getting our pears and\ntomotoes which is what we need to do."},"1000":{"dur":4,"text":"We'll move it all the way back across to that\nrow that we'd already done."},"1005":{"dur":1,"text":"Let everything else match up and do what it\nneeds to do."},"1007":{"dur":4,"text":"So now if we could ideally make a match right\nat the top or right at the bottom, that would"},"1011":{"dur":3,"text":"help move it in the direction that we want\nto but we don't have one of those."},"1015":{"dur":2,"text":"Let me show you the other thing you can do."},"1017":{"dur":4,"text":"If you have 3 and you can make it 4, like\nwe can with these plums, then you're going"},"1021":{"dur":1,"text":"to get a super cropsie."},"1022":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's have a look."},"1023":{"dur":1,"text":"A Super Plum."},"1024":{"dur":6,"text":"Now because we don't actually need plums on\nthis level because we are not collecting them,"},"1031":{"dur":5,"text":"it kind of disappeared but what it did as\nit disappeared was make the other ones worth"},"1036":{"dur":1,"text":"extra points there, so you can see that."},"1038":{"dur":3,"text":"If it's one you actually need on the level,\nthen it will just stay there and you'll match"},"1041":{"dur":2,"text":"more of them in a row."},"1044":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's just move these pears across."},"1047":{"dur":1,"text":"Line that up."},"1049":{"dur":4,"text":"And let's see, so now down the bottom we can\nmake a line of 3 with those tomatoes and that"},"1054":{"dur":1,"text":"will move the goat down."},"1055":{"dur":1,"text":"So we'll swipe that down and it will just\nmove down there."},"1056":{"dur":3,"text":"Now we've got 6 out of 14 of the ones we need\nfor that."},"1060":{"dur":5,"text":"And then if we want to move it back up the\ntop, we need to make a line there."},"1065":{"dur":2,"text":"We'll just move the carrots to make a Super\nCropsie of the carrots."},"1068":{"dur":4,"text":"And again we don't need carrots so that one's\ngoing to disappear and just give us more points"},"1072":{"dur":1,"text":"which is great."},"1074":{"dur":2,"text":"And moving, shuffling, shuffling on down."},"1076":{"dur":4,"text":"Now let's move it, we can't move it further\nup, move that one across there."},"1080":{"dur":1,"text":"We have still got 8 moves to go, so we've\ngot a bit of time."},"1082":{"dur":4,"text":"We'll move the water up and that will move\nthe goat all the way up to the top."},"1087":{"dur":3,"text":"So we have got 8 of our hay bales now, we're\ndoing well."},"1090":{"dur":3,"text":"Move that one, so it moves across to the next\nrow."},"1094":{"dur":4,"text":"So see what I mean, what you're doing is anywhere\nin front of the goat, you're trying to get"},"1099":{"dur":3,"text":"rid of things so that it will move all the\nway down to that spare spot."},"1102":{"dur":3,"text":"So at first when I started playing I was just\ntrying to get matches right next to it and"},"1106":{"dur":1,"text":"I could never get rid of all the hay
