some incentivizing, and\nthen the people that were opposed to that"},"289":{"dur":4,"text":"incentivizing went further in terms of their\nrhetoric, and then we got into a

a"},"366":{"dur":4,"text":"lot of the things that were happening in the\nfederal side, we didn't do enough of that."},"373":{"dur":5,"text":"So summarizing a couple of the key things\nthat the advocates got right would be..."},"378":{"dur":1,"text":"How would you put that?"},"380":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, I mean, the idea that high standards\nacross the country resonates, I think it does."},"384":{"dur":5,"text":"And you also look at even with the Common\nCore being pushed back on in states, you notice"},"389":{"dur":5,"text":"that they set standards that are very similar\nto the Common Core or have things in them"},"394":{"dur":1,"text":"that are like the Common Core."},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think we actually got the content right."},"398":{"dur":6,"text":"I still have yet to see stuff that challenges\nmy assumptions on what we have in the actual"},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"standard."},"405":{"dur":1,"text":"So I think the idea behind it was right."},"407":{"dur":5,"text":"I think our implementation side, we totally\nunderestimated the ability of states and districts"},"412":{"dur":3,"text":"to help their teachers get ready to teach\nthese standards."},"415":{"dur":4,"text":"We needed a full-court press on that, and\ninstead we were talking about whether the"},"420":{"dur":4,"text":"federal government wrote the standards or\nwhether a teacher evaluation was a good idea,"},"424":{"dur":3,"text":"and we should have been talking about, how\ndo we get every kid to these standards?"},"427":{"dur":1,"text":"So that brings me to, kind of, the next question."},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"It sounds like you anticipated it."},"431":{"dur":1,"text":"So what did reformers not get right?"},"432":{"dur":3,"text":"It sounds like part of it may have been something\nto do with teachers, but what did reformers"},"436":{"dur":3,"text":"get wrong looking backwards when it came to\npushing the Common

were right and everybody would just"},"448":{"dur":4,"text":"get on board, and I think we didn't spend\nenough time in those conversations about why"},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"we were doing this."},"455":{"dur":3,"text":"In reality, this should be a conservative\nidea that"},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"states set high standards for their kids."},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"Like, that should have been the Republicans\nin these state legislatures saying, \"Yes,"},"466":{"dur":1,"text":"this is right for our kids in Kentucky."},"467":{"dur":4,"text":"Yes, this is right for our kids in

also just don't think we were ready, once\nthe standards came out, to have a serious"},"494":{"dur":3,"text":"conversation about training teachers and helping\nthem understand the standards."},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"In some states, they did better than others."},"499":{"dur":4,"text":"You look at California, you know, they didn't\ndo the teacher evaluation thing and instead"},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"decided to work on implementation."},"507":{"dur":3,"text":"They aren't seeing that kind of pushback on\nthe Common Core, now granted politics

teachers."},"516":{"dur":6,"text":"So generally speaking, why didn't we see that\nkind of outreach to legislators?"},"523":{"dur":4,"text":"Why didn't we see the work with teachers that\nyou've said,

this"},"535":{"dur":5,"text":"and trying to get this thing implemented at\nthe legislative level, and there wasn't as"},"540":{"dur":5,"text":"much of a conversation about helping teachers\nwith curriculum and instruction resources."},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"Now that is not universal."},"547":{"dur":4,"text":"I want to be very clear, like, there were\nstates that did a great job on it, but I think"},"551":{"dur":4,"text":"if we had done more on that side, we wouldn't\nhave seen the pushback that we did get, because"},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"the teachers would have been there saying,\n\"You know, actually this is working for me,\""},"559":{"dur":1,"text":"and we had a lot of teachers do that."},"561":{"dur":4,"text":"If you go to Tennessee, I've visited around\nTennessee, they have teachers that will tell"},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"you, \"Just leave my standards alone."},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"We got this.\""},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's what we needed across the country."},"570":{"dur":5,"text":"We don't have that, but I will say, the big\npoint that I want to make sure I get across"},"575":{"dur":4,"text":"here is, despite all the controversy, we still\nhave 40 or 45 states with better standards"},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"than we started with."},"581":{"dur":4,"text":"So yes, there were some things we could have\ndone better, but in the end, states made the"},"586":{"dur":4,"text":"decision to keep those high standards even\nwhen they pulled back the name."},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I think that's real success here."},"592":{"dur":6,"text":"So when you point out for the 40-odd states,\nhave some version of the Common Core"},"599":{"dur":5,"text":"it seems like senior officials in the Obama Department\nof Education would say,

states to do this through our No\nChild Left Behind waivers."},"617":{"dur":4,"text":"We took a lot of grief, but that was the right\nthing, because we pushed the reform forward.\""},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"Are they right if they think about things\nthat way?"},"624":{"dur":4,"text":"Yeah, I think it just depends on your view\nof sort of how we're divided as a government,"},"629":{"dur":1,"text":"honestly."},"630":{"dur":4,"text":"And I mean from my perspective, I think they\nwent a bit far, and we told them so."},"635":{"dur":4,"text":"They shouldn't have put the specific set of\nstandards or the only way you could satisfy"},"640":{"dur":4,"text":"that requirement is by adopting Common Core\nin those two initiatives."},"644":{"dur":6,"text":"So I just think they had a real chance to\nincentivize without, sort of, mandating, and"},"650":{"dur":3,"text":"they went a little too far on some of that,\nin my opinion."},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"I think you would have started with fewer\nstates."},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that's what would have happened."},"657":{"dur":1,"text":"You wouldn't have had 45 involved."},"659":{"dur":3,"text":"You wouldn't have had 40 adopt like quickly."},"662":{"dur":3,"text":"You would have had like 20 or 25 say, \"This\nis a good thing,\" and it would have grown"},"666":{"dur":1,"text":"across the country."},"667":{"dur":5,"text":"It may have taken them six or seven years\nto get across the country."},"672":{"dur":3,"text":"I think I'd argue that that would have been\na better process."},"676":{"dur":6,"text":"The flip side would be the argument from critics\nis, \"Wait a minute, maybe you're in 40 states,"},"682":{"dur":3,"text":"but it's usually controversial."},"686":{"dur":5,"text":"Over half those states aren't using the new\nCommon Core tests, that there's real questions"},"692":{"dur":5,"text":"about how parents are receiving this, that\na more deliberate strategy...that even if"},"697":{"dur":6,"text":"the Obama administration helped to get Common\nCore adopted, that there's a whole bunch of"},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"negatives attached to that that could have\nbeen avoided."},"706":{"dur":4,"text":"I think that's true, but I would also add\nthat a lot of this would have happened anyway"},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"if it wasn't an Obama administration initiative."},"713":{"dur":4,"text":"So we do have some of that that would have\nhappened no matter what they did."},"718":{"dur":5,"text":"But I think they would even look back on their\nstrategy and say, \"Hey, maybe we...\""},"724":{"dur":4,"text":"If it had been optional, if it really had\ntruly been optional in a lot of those settings"},"728":{"dur":4,"text":"then we would have an ability to show, hey,\nthis was optional if you wanted a waiver."},"733":{"dur":4,"text":"Like we can't do that right now, and so it\nmakes it harder to have those conversations."},"737":{"dur":5,"text":"So if you look back over the decade of the\nCommon Core and Council of Chief State School"},"742":{"dur":5,"text":"Officers' role in supporting it and helping\nstates with it, are there a couple of takeaways"},"748":{"dur":6,"text":"that you take from the whole Common Core experience\nthat folks should be aware of, that help you"},"754":{"dur":1,"text":"kind of as you look forward?"},"755":{"dur":6,"text":"Well, I mean, the first thing that is really\ntrue is that the state chiefs, as a whole,"},"762":{"dur":6,"text":"really do want to lead for better outcomes\nfor kids and that when you talk, it becomes"},"768":{"dur":4,"text":"less political when you actually talk about\nwhat's going on in classrooms and districts"},"773":{"dur":1,"text":"across the country."},"774":{"dur":4,"text":"So if we can take it to a local level, we\nactually have a better conversation than if"},"778":{"dur":2,"text":"we start at the national level and then come\ndown."},"780":{"dur":5,"text":"So, like, we need to let ideas emerge from\nthe states and districts, I would say, because"},"785":{"dur":6,"text":"you know, they were really smart in NASA to\nallow for the flexibility around testing."},"792":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm really interested to see if states actually\ndo take them up on this pilot on what other"},"796":{"dur":4,"text":"tests could look like, because I think we\njust have to program the mindset around the"},"800":{"dur":2,"text":"standards and assessment, and this is the\nonly way we can do it."},"803":{"dur":5,"text":"So I'm actually hopeful that if we can start\nwith the states or the districts in some places,"},"808":{"dur":3,"text":"we will come up with better ideas for the\ncountry."},"812":{"dur":3,"text":"The second thing, and then I'm happy for follow\nup on any of that, but the second thing is"},"816":{"dur":6,"text":"that our governance system as a country is\ngoing to continue to be debated, no matter...you"},"822":{"dur":1,"text":"see it in the current nomination fight."},"824":{"dur":5,"text":"You see it in a lot of the things we have\nabout education across the country."},"829":{"dur":3,"text":"You have groups in DC that say the federal\ngovernment needs a bigger role in education"},"832":{"dur":2,"text":"to make sure the states do what they need\nto do."},"834":{"dur":4,"text":"So that's never gonna go away, and I think\nwe just got to be honest about that and say"},"838":{"dur":4,"text":"as states, \"It's our job to step up so that\ndebate becomes mute.\""},"843":{"dur":4,"text":"And you made this interesting point, you said\nwhen you talk about these things with state"},"848":{"dur":2,"text":"chiefs, you talk about them in the state,\nthat they're less political than when they're"},"850":{"dur":1,"text":"getting talked about in Washington."},"852":{"dur":1,"text":"Why is that?"},"853":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, I mean, I think there's a whole institution\nof education in this town that is designed"},"857":{"dur":2,"text":"to fight with each other."},"860":{"dur":4,"text":"We have people that come to work every day\nto protect kids the states have traditionally"},"865":{"dur":2,"text":"ignored, and I love that they're here doing\nthat."},"868":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that's important for us."},"869":{"dur":4,"text":"We need that push, but when states do the\nright thing, we also need to say, \"Hey, they're"},"874":{"dur":1,"text":"doing the right thing.\""},"875":{"dur":2,"text":"You can't always have states be the bad guys,\nright?"},"877":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is actually an interesting discussion."},"880":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm really glad we're having it, because it\nputs in the context what I've been wrestling"},"883":{"dur":5,"text":"with which is how do we have an honest discussion\nabout what's actually going on in education,"},"889":{"dur":5,"text":"not what we think is going on, because states\nare creating these SO plans."},"894":{"dur":1,"text":"They're building accountability systems."},"896":{"dur":2,"text":"How would we know things are better in this\ncountry?"},"899":{"dur":3,"text":"And I would argue, it's if we had more kids\ngoing on to college, we had more kids going"},"902":{"dur":3,"text":"on in the job placement programs, more career\nopportunities for kids"},"906":{"dur":1,"text":"coming out of high school."},"908":{"dur":3,"text":"So if I was the state chief right now, I would\nbe looking at those metrics coming out of"},"911":{"dur":1,"text":"my high schools."},"912":{"dur":4,"text":"Are those moving, because we need kids to\nbe ready to go and all this other noise, all"},"917":{"dur":1,"text":"the other noise."},"918":{"dur":4,"text":"We need more kids and more kids with color\ndoing better on those metrics."},"922":{"dur":6,"text":"So as we think about the Common Core, you\nguys in the NGA really got started on this"},"929":{"dur":2,"text":"post-2007, I guess, right?"},"931":{"dur":2,"text":"So ten years ago."},"934":{"dur":4,"text":"Right, this created enormous disruption in\nthe school reform world."},"939":{"dur":5,"text":"People who used to work together became opponents,\nlots of

that?\""},"978":{"dur":5,"text":"I said, \"Sure, let's go do it,\" and at that\npoint, we thought we were really just gonna"},"983":{"dur":3,"text":"have a small number of states work together\nand set those standards and then we were to"},"987":{"dur":1,"text":"go to a bigger audience."},"988":{"dur":4,"text":"When we had 48 states sign up to develop the\nstandards, then we knew."},"993":{"dur":3,"text":"Then we knew it was gonna be like, \"Okay,\nthis is a big thing for the country.\""},"997":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I mean, was it worth it?"},"999":{"dur":3,"text":"I think
