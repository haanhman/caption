beliefs."},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"The Puritans came here\nfor religious reasons, or so they said,"},"641":{"dur":3,"text":"but they also came here because\nthey wanted to make a lot of money."},"645":{"dur":1,"text":"They were pious people,"},"646":{"dur":3,"text":"but they were also\nreally aggressive capitalists,"},"649":{"dur":3,"text":"and they were accused of extreme forms\nof profit-making tendencies,"},"653":{"dur":1,"text":"compared to the other colonists."},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"But at the same time,\nthe Puritans were Calvinists,"},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"so they were

cents on the dollar."},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"So of course, how could you\nmake money in charity"},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"if charity was your penance\nfor making money?"},"694":{"dur":3,"text":"Financial incentive was exiled\nfrom the realm of helping others,"},"698":{"dur":3,"text":"so that it could thrive in the area\nof making money for

a lot of problems\nwith this question."},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to just focus on two."},"722":{"dur":4,"text":"First, it makes us think\nthat overhead is a negative,"},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"that it is somehow not part of the cause."},"730":{"dur":3,"text":"But it absolutely is, especially\nif it's being used for growth."},"735":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, this idea that overhead\nis somehow an enemy of the cause"},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"creates this second, much larger problem,"},"741":{"dur":3,"text":"which is, it forces organizations\nto go without the overhead things"},"745":{"dur":1,"text":"they really need to grow,"},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"in the interest of keeping overhead low."},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"So we've all been taught\nthat charities should spend"},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"as little as possible on overhead\nthings like fundraising"},"755":{"dur":3,"text":"under the theory that, well, the less\nmoney you spend on fundraising,"},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"the more money there is\navailable for the cause."},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, that's true\nif it's a depressing world"},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"in which this pie cannot\nbe made any bigger."},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"But if it's a logical world\nin which investment in fundraising"},"771":{"dur":3,"text":"actually raises more funds\nand makes the pie bigger,"},"775":{"dur":1,"text":"then we have it precisely backwards,"},"777":{"dur":3,"text":"and we should be investing more money,\nnot less, in fundraising,"},"780":{"dur":1,"text":"because
