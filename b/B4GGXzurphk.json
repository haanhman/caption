here."},"1401":{"dur":1,"text":"So that was Row 1."},"1403":{"dur":17,"text":"We turn the work, Row 2 is just a purl 8."},"1420":{"dur":15,"text":"Row 3 is slip 1, knit 6."},"1435":{"dur":1,"text":"And then another ssk."},"1437":{"dur":4,"text":"Slip, slip, knit and turn the work."},"1442":{"dur":6,"text":"And those are the only two rows you need to\nknow to work all three of these squares."},"1449":{"dur":6,"text":"You\u00edre going to pick up and knit along these\nsides, and then work Row 1 and Row 2, keeping"},"1456":{"dur":4,"text":"track of what row you\u00edre on, of course, with\nyour counter."},"1460":{"dur":4,"text":"And so that tier actually goes pretty quickly."},"1465":{"dur":16,"text":"Next up we\u00edre going to talk about doing the\nfinal tier triangles."},"1481":{"dur":4,"text":"If you\u00edve made it this far in the scarf and\nyou\u00edre ready to work the Final Tier triangles,"},"1485":{"dur":1,"text":"these triangles are going to be super easy\nfor you."},"1487":{"dur":4,"text":"You\u00edve already done pretty much all of the\ntechniques involved up to this point."},"1491":{"dur":3,"text":"Let\u00eds take a look at these, anyway."},"1495":{"dur":6,"text":"Here is my unblocked piece, and this would\nactually be huge if it was blocked."},"1501":{"dur":3,"text":"Because I\u00edve added an extra eight stitches\nto this one."},"1505":{"dur":4,"text":"There\u00eds an extra square here in the middle\nif you can see that."},"1509":{"dur":5,"text":"But it\u00eds unblocked, so it ends up being just\nabout as wide as the blocked one."},"1514":{"dur":2,"text":"It\u00eds the exact same yarn in both."},"1517":{"dur":2,"text":"Funny how different it looks."},"1519":{"dur":5,"text":"Okay for the Final Tier triangles you are\nset up here like this."},"1525":{"dur":3,"text":"And just like before we\u00edre going to pick\nup and knit 8 stitches along the selvedge"},"1529":{"dur":1,"text":"edge."},"1530":{"dur":5,"text":"I\u00edm using a smaller sample here, but if you\u00edve\nmade it this far in the video, you are experienced"},"1535":{"dur":8,"text":"at picking up and knitting by now!"},"1543":{"dur":9,"text":"Okay, and then like before, I\u00edm going to\nslip that stitch back over to the left needle"},"1553":{"dur":6,"text":"and ssk."},"1560":{"dur":2,"text":"Turn the work."},"1562":{"dur":1,"text":"And these rows, the wrong side rows are easy."},"1564":{"dur":8,"text":"We\u00edre just going to purl all the stitches\nin that section."},"1573":{"dur":14,"text":"And the stitches in the section are going\nto get smaller with every right side row,"},"1587":{"dur":10,"text":"because now I\u00edm going to start by knitting\ntwo together \u00f1 whoops, I split that."},"1598":{"dur":10,"text":"Knitting two together, third time\u00d6"},"1608":{"dur":4,"text":"Knit 5."},"1613":{"dur":2,"text":"SSK."},"1615":{"dur":1,"text":"And turn work."},"1616":{"dur":3,"text":"And now there are seven stitches in this section."},"1619":{"dur":1,"text":"And that\u00eds what I wanted to show you."},"1621":{"dur":2,"text":"And there\u00eds one more technique I want to\nshow you."},"1623":{"dur":4,"text":"The very end of the final tier triangle there\u00eds\nsomething called psso."},"1628":{"dur":6,"text":"We\u00edre not there yet, but I\u00edm going to use\nthis as an example to show you."},"1634":{"dur":9,"text":"Row 15 of the pattern, if you want to take\na look at that, it says slip 1, ssk, psso."},"1644":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay?"},"1646":{"dur":5,"text":"So I\u00edm going to slip one, you always slip\nas if to purl, ssk, and you\u00edre familiar with"},"1651":{"dur":4,"text":"how to do that, and then I\u00edm going to pass\nthe slipped stitch over."},"1656":{"dur":2,"text":"That\u00eds what psso stands for."},"1658":{"dur":5,"text":"Take the stitch that you slipped, and pass\nit over the other one like binding it off,"},"1663":{"dur":1,"text":"and let go of it."},"1665":{"dur":3,"text":"I\u00edm going to undo that, because that does\nnot go here in this section."},"1668":{"dur":2,"text":"It doesn\u00edt go here in the work right where\nI am."},"1671":{"dur":4,"text":"I just wanted to make sure you understood\nwhat psso stood for."},"1675":{"dur":6,"text":"I still have to finish this final triangle\nbefore I get down to Row 15 to work that."},"1682":{"dur":4,"text":"Anyway, that\u00eds how to work the entrelac scarf."},"1687":{"dur":5,"text":"Again, if you want your free copy of the pattern,\nit\u00eds available on frecklesandpurls.com,
