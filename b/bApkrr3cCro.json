list."},"186":{"dur":3,"text":"And so he had this innovative\nidea to look at the data sets"},"190":{"dur":1,"text":"and do the classic\nmachine learning"},"191":{"dur":1,"text":"like you would do in\ngenomics to say, listen,"},"193":{"dur":2,"text":"these are substantive data\nthat would predict the outcome."},"196":{"dur":0,"text":"And he did that."},"197":{"dur":1,"text":"And he showed that

autism"},"204":{"dur":0,"text":"spectrum, for example."},"205":{"dur":2,"text":"So he tried to get them\nto the front of a line."},"207":{"dur":2,"text":"But then he did what I would\nsay is a bridging study."},"210":{"dur":2,"text":"When he looked at all the\ndata points, some of them,"},"212":{"dur":1,"text":"parents could just tell you."},"213":{"dur":3,"text":"But some things, you\nhad to see the kid."},"217":{"dur":3,"text":"And the [INAUDIBLE] there's\na one-year bottleneck when"},"220":{"dur":1,"text":"a pediatrician refers a child."},"221":{"dur":1,"text":"The average wait

moment."},"229":{"dur":3,"text":"His aha moment was he\nset up a clinical study,"},"233":{"dur":2,"text":"and he asked the parents\nassociated with Harvard"},"236":{"dur":4,"text":"to upload videos of

channel."},"244":{"dur":2,"text":"But they're basically\nYouTube videos."},"246":{"dur":3,"text":"And a lot of the stuff that\nhe got in was uninterpretable."},"250":{"dur":2,"text":"But he was able

that's where the light\nwent off to say, listen,"},"260":{"dur":0,"text":"we could be disruptive."},"261":{"dur":1,"text":"We could put this in\nthe hands of parents"},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"because

turned the tables."},"270":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think that trying to\nsolve the problem first"},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"and not worrying about\nthe systemic constraints,"},"275":{"dur":1,"text":"he never would have done step 2."},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"Start with the innovation\nand work on the feasibility."},"279":{"dur":1,"text":"One last question for

vaccinating"},"312":{"dur":1,"text":"because maybe they just\ndon't quite understand"},"314":{"dur":1,"text":"the numbers behind it."},"315":{"dur":3,"text":"And it was interesting the\nway that Dana from IDEO"},"319":{"dur":0,"text":"had thought about."},"320":{"dur":1,"text":"She said, really\nwhat you need to do"},"321":{"dur":1,"text":"is you need to tell stories."},"323":{"dur":1,"text":"And you need to\ntell stories that's"},"325":{"dur":1,"text":"not about trying to\ndrill in science."},"327":{"dur":4,"text":"You don't attack a belief\nargument with data."},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"You
