exciting."},"24":{"dur":0,"text":"What is it?"},"25":{"dur":3,"text":"NICK TURNER: OK, this is our\nprototype of our FTIR machine."},"28":{"dur":2,"text":"But I'm going to come back\nto that in a little bit"},"30":{"dur":0,"text":"if, that's OK."},"31":{"dur":1,"text":"INTERVIEWER: That's fine."},"32":{"dur":0,"text":"Right."},"33":{"dur":1,"text":"We're talking about infrareds."},"34":{"dur":0,"text":"NICK TURNER: Yes."},"35":{"dur":1,"text":"INTERVIEWER: So\nfill us in, then."},"37":{"dur":0,"text":"NICK TURNER: OK."},"38":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you imagine light,\nas we kind of see it,"},"41":{"dur":2,"text":"we see all the\ncolours around us."},"43":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's in\nphysics, just part of"},"45":{"dur":2,"text":"the electromagnetic spectrum."},"47":{"dur":2,"text":"But the electromagnetic\nspectrum is more than just"},"49":{"dur":0,"text":"visible light."},"50":{"dur":2,"text":"So you've heard of\nultraviolet, which"},"52":{"dur":4,"text":"is one end towards the blue end\nof the rainbow, if you will."},"56":{"dur":3,"text":"And you also have infrared,\nwhich is below red."},"60":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's kind of where it is."},"61":{"dur":3,"text":"It's the next section down from\nour visible light spectrum."},"65":{"dur":0,"text":"INTERVIEWER: OK."},"66":{"dur":2,"text":"So how can we then\nview it if it's"},"69":{"dur":1,"text":"right at the end\nof the spectrum?"},"70":{"dur":2,"text":"NICK TURNER: Well we have\nthe ability to study those"},"73":{"dur":2,"text":"wavelength, and kind of put\nfalse colours onto them,"},"76":{"dur":0,"text":"if you will."},"77":{"dur":3,"text":"So the infrared section is\nwhere things thermally radiate."},"80":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you've got something hot,\nthat it kind of will give out"},"84":{"dur":3,"text":"thermal energy that is\nin the infrared spectrum."},"88":{"dur":1,"text":"And we're able to see that."},"89":{"dur":3,"text":"So what I have here is a\nthermal camera attached an iPad."},"92":{"dur":1,"text":"INTERVIEWER: Is this like\nthese thermal cameras you see"},"94":{"dur":1,"text":"in police chases in\n{?_[INTERPOSING

prettier."},"110":{"dur":1,"text":"INTERVIEWER: Very nice."},"111":{"dur":4,"text":"NICK TURNER: So what we have\nis essentially a false colour"},"115":{"dur":0,"text":"image."},"116":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's picking up the radiation\nthat bodies are giving off."},"120":{"dur":4,"text":"So the actual heat we're seeing,\nwhich is the infrared energy."},"125":{"dur":3,"text":"So if I put my hand in the\nway, we can see my hand here."},"128":{"dur":2,"text":"So my fingers are slightly\ncolder than my

come\nin, so I'm outside in the cold."},"147":{"dur":5,"text":"So what we have here\nis a hot cup of tea."},"152":{"dur":3,"text":"And we can, if I put it\ndown, you can see the water"},"156":{"dur":2,"text":"and the heat\nradiating from this."},"158":{"dur":3,"text":"You can also see the\ndifference in the cup."},"161":{"dur":2,"text":"So the bit which is\nactually near the liquid"},"164":{"dur":3,"text":"is obviously hotter\nthan the rim."},"168":{"dur":2,"text":"And we'll try it the\nother way around."},"171":{"dur":3,"text":"I have a nice, ice\ncold cup of cola here."},"174":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's kind of blue, so\nit's absorbing the heat, which"},"179":{"dur":2,"text":"we have right here, difference."},"181":{"dur":2,"text":"Now I've had this sitting\non a piece of paper."},"184":{"dur":3,"text":"So hopefully this will work, and\nthe paper will have different"},"188":{"dur":2,"text":"colours on it."},"190":{"dur":3,"text":"So you can see\nwhere the brightness"},"193":{"dur":5,"text":"bit is where the paper's absorbs\nheat from the hot cup of tea,"},"198":{"dur":2,"text":"and the darker bit\ndown at the bottom"},"200":{"dur":5,"text":"is where heat has been absorbed\nby the paper, by the cola."},"206":{"dur":1,"text":"So these are really,\nreally useful,"},"207":{"dur":3,"text":"because it allows us to see\ninto the infrared spectrum."},"210":{"dur":2,"text":"So for night vision,\nand as you said"},"213":{"dur":3,"text":"on police camera action, when\nyou kind of see those police"},"216":{"dur":0,"text":"chases."},"217":{"dur":1,"text":"And Springwatch, of course."},"218":{"dur":0,"text":"INTERVIEWER: Yeah."},"219":{"dur":0,"text":"OK."},"220":{"dur":2,"text":"So why, then, I mean, we can\nsort of see the relevance"},"222":{"dur":0,"text":"in those sorts of areas."},"223":{"dur":2,"text":"But why at the Open University\nare you interested in this?"},"225":{"dur":2,"text":"NICK TURNER: Well, it has lots\nof applications, as you said,"},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"with the ones we've discussed,\ndiscussed [INAUDIBLE]."},"230":{"dur":3,"text":"But I'm a chemist by training."},"234":{"dur":4,"text":"And we use this for\nanalysing chemical compounds."},"239":{"dur":3,"text":"So effectively, each\ncompound-- and I have some--"},"242":{"dur":0,"text":"INTERVIEWER: Ahh, I wondered\nwhat the model things were!"},"243":{"dur":0,"text":"NICK TURNER: I have\nsome models here."},"244":{"dur":1,"text":"This is a model of caffeine."},"248":{"dur":3,"text":"Will absorb infrared\nenergy differently."},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is where our\nspectrophotometer comes in."},"254":{"dur":1,"text":"So each of these bonds--"},"255":{"dur":0,"text":"Your spectropho-what?"},"256":{"dur":1,"text":"NICK TURNER: Spectrophotometer."},"257":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's a machine that absorbs\nspectra and measures photons."},"261":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is what we have."},"264":{"dur":3,"text":"So each of these\nbonds, if you will,"},"267":{"dur":2,"text":"and if you imagine\na chemical molecule,"},"270":{"dur":2,"text":"will absorb differently,\ndepending on how"},"273":{"dur":3,"text":"it moves within its structure."},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"So different Compounds-- so\nI've got this is caffeine,"},"279":{"dur":2,"text":"and this is ampicillin, which\nas you can see is a bit more"},"282":{"dur":1,"text":"flexible--"},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"will absorb much very,\nvery differently."},"286":{"dur":1,"text":"INTERVIEWER: So would\nthis sort of thing"},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"be able to differentiate\nbetween the two compounds?"},"290":{"dur":2,"text":"Is it that accurate, that you\ncan tell which one is caffeine?"},"292":{"dur":0,"text":"NICK TURNER: Exactly."},"293":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'm actually going to\nshow that to you, if possible."},"297":{"dur":2,"text":"INTERVIEWER: And this is on\nthe Open Science Laboratory."},"299":{"dur":0,"text":"NICK TURNER: Yes it is."},"300":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is one of the latest\nbits of instruments that we've"},"303":{"dur":3,"text":"picked up, which is going to be\ncoming into different courses"},"306":{"dur":1,"text":"that we're going to be using."},"308":{"dur":1,"text":"The idea is that\nstudents will be"},"310":{"dur":3,"text":"able to log on and\nrun experiments"},"313":{"dur":3,"text":"from home from their iPads,\nand even their phones."},"317":{"dur":2,"text":"So you'll be able to\ndo your laboratory"},"319":{"dur":1,"text":"experiments on the move."},"321":{"dur":1,"text":"INTERVIEWER: It's very\ninteresting, because as Hazel"},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"[INAUDIBLE] said the other day,\nwe're no longer sending out"},"324":{"dur":2,"text":"chemicals to people\nfor them to do at home,"},"326":{"dur":2,"text":"although that used to\nbe the case with the OU."},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"The Open Science Laboratory\nhas got a massive range"},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"of various tools and\nthings that students"},"333":{"dur":1,"text":"can do live science on."},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"One of the benefits of using\nthe Open Science Laboratory"},"338":{"dur":5,"text":"is that we have top of the\nrange analytical equipment."},"344":{"dur":1,"text":"So the kind of\nthings that you would"},"345":{"dur":4,"text":"see in a proper chemical\nlaboratory in industry"},"349":{"dur":1,"text":"or in a forensics laboratory."},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"INTERVIEWER: So this is the\nactual similar experience,"},"353":{"dur":2,"text":"or the same experience, even,\nthat people would use in terms"},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"of the data that they\ncan actually input,"},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"and the tools that you\ncan use to analyse it."},"360":{"dur":0,"text":"NICK TURNER: Exactly."},"361":{"dur":3,"text":"So if we can look at the\ntop, if we kind of look"},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"at the top corner\nup here, we actually"},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"have a camera focused\non the instrument which"},"369":{"dur":4,"text":"is sitting in a lab about 200\nmetres away from where I'm sat."},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'm going--hopefully-- yeah."},"378":{"dur":1,"text":"It's working."},"380":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'm going to control it."},"381":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's now going to\ngo and position itself"},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"ready for our first sample."},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"So I will click\nthe Sample button."},"390":{"dur":3,"text":"So we have quite a\nsimple, simple kind"},"393":{"dur":1,"text":"of interface for this."},"394":{"dur":2,"text":"And each time one of\nthe circle goes around,"},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"it's collecting data."},"399":{"dur":2,"text":"So it collects\ndata for 16 cycles."},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"And we get these peaks here."},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"Now each of these\npeaks effectively"},"408":{"dur":3,"text":"is absorption of light\nby one of these bonds."},"412":{"dur":1,"text":"So we can tell by the\nshape of the peaks"},"414":{"dur":4,"text":"and the pattern of the peaks\nwhat's actually present."},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"So we can work out which\natoms, which chemical it is."},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"But also by the\nsize of the peaks,"},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"we can tell the concentrations."},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"We can tell how much is there."},"428":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is one of our compounds."},"432":{"dur":4,"text":"And if I click another one, and\nit moves around, what we have,"},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"we've got two pure\ncompounds that we've put"},"439":{"dur":3,"text":"in here, and then a mixture."},"442":{"dur":3,"text":"So we should be able to see\nsome of the peaks shared"},"446":{"dur":1,"text":"between the two."},"447":{"dur":4,"text":"So if we look in this region\nhere, there's no sharp peak."},"452":{"dur":3,"text":"But if I press this--"},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"there we go-- we\nshould hopefully"},"458":{"dur":4,"text":"be able to see a peak in that\nregion on this next spectra."},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"INTERVIEWER: So do you have\nprofiles and have samples"},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"from libraries that\nyou can use to compare"},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"to see whether you've\ngot the right sample?"},"470":{"dur":0,"text":"NICK TURNER: Yeah."},"471":{"dur":6,"text":"So a chemical compound\nwill be taken,"},"477":{"dur":3,"text":"and have a range of different\nexperiments run on it."},"480":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's a\ndatabase called NIST,"},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"which is the American\ndatabase which"},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"is fully accessible to anyone."},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can put the\ninformation into it."},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's just N-I-S-T.\nAnd if you search that,"},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"you come across something\ncalled the Chemistry Web Book."},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"You can click open that."},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"You can then type in whichever\nchemical you're interested in."},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"And it will give all of\nthe physical chemical data."},"501":{"dur":1,"text":"INTERVIEWER: So you\ncould then, I guess,"},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"identify whether your sample\nmight be polluted, or have"},"505":{"dur":1,"text":"an issue with it."},"506":{"dur":0,"text":"NICK TURNER: That's\nexactly right."},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"So what we've done is\nwe've here, if we come back"},"509":{"dur":0,"text":"to these results."},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"So we've actually\ngot a peak here."},"512":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is our pure ampicillin,\nwhich is this compound here."},"517":{"dur":5,"text":"And we now have a\nmixture which should"},"522":{"dur":3,"text":"have characteristics of both."},"525":{"dur":4,"text":"Now this might be of\ninterest for situations"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"where somebody has,\nperhaps, adulterated."},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you were looking to\nsee if a drug was pure,"},"535":{"dur":3,"text":"and it wasn't a counterfeit, you\nmight use a machine like this"},"539":{"dur":3,"text":"to analyse it."},"542":{"dur":1,"text":"INTERVIEWER: It's amazing\nthat it's actually"},"544":{"dur":3,"text":"physically so close to us, and\nyou can see it all happening."},"547":{"dur":0,"text":"NICK TURNER: Exactly."},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"It's quite nice."},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"And as I said, this interface\nhas been designed for students"},"552":{"dur":0,"text":"to be able to use."},"553":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's going to\nbe coming online"},"555":{"dur":3,"text":"on a number of our chemistry,\nand chemistry and science"},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"courses in the next year or so."},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"INTERVIEWER: But could this\nbe used in criminal cases--"},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"for example, to identify drugs,\nand where they came from,"},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"maybe if there were\nsort of similarities"},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"in terms of impurities."},"568":{"dur":0,"text":"NICK TURNER: Yes."},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"You should be able\nto, with the kind"},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"of compounds, because each\ncompound, if you will,"},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"has its own spectrum--"},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"it has its own\nfingerprint, if you will--"},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"you can detect the\npresence of other compounds"},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"which are in that spectrum."},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you have something\nwhich is a mixture,"},"585":{"dur":3,"text":"then you can actually pick\nup whether it's there or not."},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"So currently, this\nsample here is quite wet."},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"So you have this\nreally big peak,"},"593":{"dur":1,"text":"which is attributed to water."},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"INTERVIEWER: That's\nreally interesting."},"596":{"dur":4,"text":"Are there any surprising\nuses of this, then?"},"600":{"dur":1,"text":"NICK TURNER: Of infrared?"},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"Or this kind of spectroscopy?"},"603":{"dur":0,"text":"Yeah."},"604":{"dur":1,"text":"NICK TURNER: Well it's\nused, as you said,"},"606":{"dur":1,"text":"it's used in drug analysis."},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"It's used for\nmeasuring counterfeits."},"610":{"dur":4,"text":"But infrared in general is\nused quite significantly"},"614":{"dur":3,"text":"in different types\nof spectroscopy."},"618":{"dur":3,"text":"One of the kind of recent\nthings that has been developed,"},"621":{"dur":4,"text":"are really powerful infrared\nspectrum telescopes."},"626":{"dur":5,"text":"So they're able to look at the\nabsorption of infrared light"},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"by interstellar dust\nto be able to look"},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"at the chemical compounds\nthat are just floating"},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"in the vastness\nof space, and not"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"actually surrounding planets."},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"What's actually in the\ninterstellar medium."},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"INTERVIEWER: Fascinating stuff."},"645":{"dur":3,"text":"Can we take a quick\ntrip to the Hot Desk,"},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"where we could\npossibly not measure"},"650":{"dur":3,"text":"the amount of heat generated\nfrom the chat and discussion?"},"653":{"dur":1,"text":"We're talking about\na lot of stuff."},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"But HJ and Sophie, how are\nyou both hanging in there?"},"658":{"dur":3,"text":"SOPHIE: I'm just about keeping\nto grips with everything."},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"Science is never\nreally my strong point."},"664":{"dur":1,"text":"But it's so interesting."},"666":{"dur":1,"text":"And we've really\ngot a lot of people"},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"who are rally interested\nin it, and the molecules"},"670":{"dur":1,"text":"and all sorts."},"671":{"dur":1,"text":"And we have got Gideon as well."},"672":{"dur":4,"text":"He's joined us from\nNamibia in Africa."},"676":{"dur":1,"text":"So, hi."},"678":{"dur":3,"text":"HJ: And Jeff says as well that\nthrough the Open Science Lab"},"681":{"dur":4,"text":"you can connect to a telescope,\nmicroscopes, and Mars rovers"},"685":{"dur":0,"text":"as well."},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm sure we'll have to\ndefinitely have a look at that."},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"And we posted all the\nlinks in the chat to NIST"},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"and the Open Science Lab for\nyou to have a look at as well."},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"INTERVIEWER: Well, that's\ninteresting, actually."},"697":{"dur":1,"text":"So thinking of the\ntopic of space,"},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"we often think of it\nas a vacuum, don't we?"},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"But that there's\nstuff in space, too."},"702":{"dur":0,"text":"NICK TURNER: Yeah."},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"There's material\nfloating around."},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's not just simple\ncompounds, as you'd think,"},"707":{"dur":3,"text":"just gases like carbon\ndioxide, or nitrogen dioxide."},"710":{"dur":4,"text":"Proper complex\nmolecules are present."},"714":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's quite\ninteresting, because we"},"716":{"dur":3,"text":"have researchers here who are\nlooking at the origins of life."},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"And actually being able\nto measure and find"},"723":{"dur":1,"text":"evidence of these\nkind of compounds"},"725":{"dur":3,"text":"floating around in space and\naround interstellar bodies"},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"is really exciting to\nthose kind of researchers."},"731":{"dur":1,"text":"INTERVIEWER: So do\nthings like this"},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"ever end up on things like\nthe [INAUDIBLE] lander."},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, we've been\nspeaking recently"},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"about some of the initiatives\nthat the Open University have"},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"been doing in terms of space."},"740":{"dur":3,"text":"Would you ever use\ninstruments like this"},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"to actually measure\nwhat's out there in space"},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"on particular planets\nor moons or asteroids,"},"748":{"dur":1,"text":"and send that back to earth?"},"750":{"dur":0,"text":"NICK TURNER: So yeah."},"751":{"dur":3,"text":"So infrared sensors\nwould be on telescopes."},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"They'd be very\npopular on telescopes."},"756":{"dur":1,"text":"And certainly they\nwould be on cameras."},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"So rovers that are\non Mars, for example,"},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"or if we do visit\nany other planets,"},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"will have infrared\nability, because they'd"},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"want to be able\nto measure, again,"},"768":{"dur":1,"text":"the potential of\nthe spectra here,"},"770":{"dur":2,"text":"or the general heat of things."},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's kind of where\nyou might find them."},"775":{"dur":0,"text":"INTERVIEWER: Wow."},"776":{"dur":1,"text":"So are you working with\nmany other colleagues,"},"778":{"dur":1,"text":"then, on things like this?"},"780":{"dur":1,"text":"Do you work with people\nwho are developing"},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"the rover, for example,\nover the road there?"},"784":{"dur":1,"text":"NICK TURNER: Not so much."},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"My research here tends\nto be quite lab-based."},"787":{"dur":6,"text":"So my actual what I do in the\nlaboratory is quite lab-based."},"794":{"dur":2,"text":"This kind of thing, I'm working\non developing the Open Science"},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"Laboratory with my colleagues."},"799":{"dur":1,"text":"INTERVIEWER:

Laboratory."},"805":{"dur":1,"text":"What other things\nthen are you working?"},"806":{"dur":1,"text":"Have we sort of finished\nthis section, by the way?"},"808":{"dur":2,"text":"Because I don't want to\ninterject if there's something"},"810":{"dur":1,"text":"else you want to dish out."},"812":{"dur":1,"text":"INTERVIEWER: Ah, brilliant."},"813":{"dur":1,"text":"What other things\nare available, then?"},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"NICK TURNER: So we\nhave instrumentation"},"818":{"dur":1,"text":"for looking at chromatography."},"819":{"dur":2,"text":"So you might have done\nthe experiment at school,"},"821":{"dur":4,"text":"where you bought some ink,\nand then separated it out with"},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"water so it went into\ndifferent colours."},"828":{"dur":2,"text":"So we have sets for\nequipment in laboratory"},"830":{"dur":3,"text":"which allows us to specifically,\nwith really, really"},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"high precision, separate\nout a mixture of compounds."},"837":{"dur":2,"text":"So that machine\nis called a HPLC--"},"839":{"dur":2,"text":"a high pressure\nliquid chromatograph."},"842":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're bringing\nthat system

ultraviolet"},"859":{"dur":1,"text":"and in the visible range."},"861":{"dur":2,"text":"INTERVIEWER: So if you're doing\na lot of laboratory-based work,"},"864":{"dur":4,"text":"what's the most exciting\npart of your job, then?"},"868":{"dur":1,"text":"If you're not going\nout on these missions"},"870":{"dur":1,"text":"and being involved\nin other things."},"871":{"dur":1,"text":"Because you're looking\nat a lot of data."},"873":{"dur":1,"text":"And that can be\nreally, really exciting"},"874":{"dur":1,"text":"when you find something."},"875":{"dur":2,"text":"But it must also be difficult\nin terms of analysing"},"878":{"dur":1,"text":"and comparing a lot of things."},"880":{"dur":3,"text":"NICK TURNER: I think working\nin laboratory, when you come up"},"883":{"dur":1,"text":"with an idea, and you've\ngone into laboratory,"},"885":{"dur":1,"text":"and you've designed\nyour experiment,"},"887":{"dur":3,"text":"and you've tested it,\nand it
