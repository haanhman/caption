such."},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's how I\n   would address it,"},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"to just check over\n   how things recheck"},"677":{"dur":4,"text":"and to get an idea of\n   how the

of"},"771":{"dur":4,"text":"ADOT motor vehicle\noffices in rural areas?"},"776":{"dur":2,"text":"- I'm very much\n   in favor of that."},"780":{"dur":4,"text":"Because in some of\n   these rural areas"},"784":{"dur":1,"text":"they just don't get any service."},"786":{"dur":4,"text":"And the state's obligation\n   and duty is to serve"},"790":{"dur":3,"text":"within the state\nborders and
