what"},"312":{"dur":2,"text":"was going to happen when\nall these railways joined"},"314":{"dur":3,"text":"up, and from a series of\nseparate lines became a system"},"318":{"dur":1,"text":"or a

start coalescing,"},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"a few companies get together,\nand they set up what's"},"350":{"dur":1,"text":"called a railway clearinghouse."},"351":{"dur":4,"text":"It's a place where all\nthe costs and income"},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"can be assessed and\nsorted out, usually"},"358":{"dur":1,"text":"on the basis of mileage."},"360":{"dur":3,"text":"So this requires a\nvery

tickets became\ntheir own receipts,"},"411":{"dur":1,"text":"their own counterfoils."},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"And so they're checking."},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"They're number crunching, I\nthink

were\ndoing through entirely"},"435":{"dur":4,"text":"old-fashioned pen and\npaper sort of media,"},"439":{"dur":4,"text":"again within living memory."},"444":{"dur":1,"text":"It still exists,

and grew,\nbecause eventually"},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"all the British companies,\nexcept for a few very small"},"459":{"dur":1,"text":"ones, all came onside."},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"So now back to the origins."},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the Liverpool\nand Manchester Railway."},"469":{"dur":4,"text":"It opened in 8:30, the first\nmature passenger railway."},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"There were other ways\nof travelling by train,"},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"behind a horse, horse\ndrawn vehicles on rail,"},"479":{"dur":0,"text":"things like that."},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"But this is the

this introduces\nthe question of class."},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"Then there was first,\nsecond, and third class."},"495":{"dur":3,"text":"And it doesn't\ntake much thinking"},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"to see which ones they are."},"499":{"dur":3,"text":"The upper train is\nall first class."},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"They had separate first\nclass trains originally."},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"And the

They were"},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"built by the same people who\nwere building the stagecoaches,"},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"because there wasn't suddenly\na new industry of railway"},"524":{"dur":0,"text":"carriage building."},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"You just found someone who would\nbuild these things for you."},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"And then right at\nthe very back, you"},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"see what's called\na carriage truck."},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a flat wagon onto which\nyou could drive your carriage"},"533":{"dur":1,"text":"if you happen to\nbe wealthy enough"},"535":{"dur":1,"text":"to have your own carriage."},"537":{"dur":3,"text":"So people having done that, they\nwould actually travel in them."},"541":{"dur":3,"text":"And it sounds a bit outlandish,\nand it was not entirely safe,"},"544":{"dur":2,"text":"because you would get cinders\nfrom the locomotive falling"},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"on you and things like that,\nand it was certainly exposed."},"549":{"dur":4,"text":"But the idea came back\nwhen the Eurostar trains"},"554":{"dur":1,"text":"started running."},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"If you've ever done it,\nyou drive your vehicle"},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"into a covered\nwagon, in this case,"},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"and you go through the\ntunnel, and you come out"},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's an idea that\ncame,

we've got\nmore or less exposed."},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"As it settled down, eventually,\nthird class-- and we'll"},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"see some early examples later--\nwere actually completely open."},"583":{"dur":3,"text":"They were almost like cattle\ntrucks without roofs, at least"},"587":{"dur":3,"text":"in the early years\nof the railway."},"590":{"dur":4,"text":"So you're creating a\nseries of social spaces,"},"594":{"dur":3,"text":"because stagecoaches\nwere social spaces too."},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"But more people are traveling,\nand they're travelling further,"},"600":{"dur":4,"text":"and the experience of the\nchance to travel is moving down"},"604":{"dur":1,"text":"the social scale,\nbecause it's cheaper."},"609":{"dur":0,"text":"So this is first
