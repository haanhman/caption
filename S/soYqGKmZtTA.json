protesting."},"492":{"dur":4,"text":"So that's being managed by\nthem, so I don't have to."},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's sort of\nvicarious protesting."},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"Or because

not"},"518":{"dur":1,"text":"protested directly themselves."},"520":{"dur":3,"text":"Because I mean if we go back\nto this idea about religion"},"524":{"dur":1,"text":"in terms of a social\nform of

things."},"539":{"dur":3,"text":"But are you saying that protests\nas a mass spontaneous gathering"},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"have more emphasis in terms\nof getting a share of

that\npeople want to protest about."},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"Or maybe it's a conflict\nin some other place."},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"But nevertheless, people\ndraw on this

right."},"623":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's take a trip\nto the hot desk"},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"and see what people are chatting\nabout as they're beginning"},"626":{"dur":1,"text":"to join this evening's

interesting\nfor me to hear"},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"that you can protest online."},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"You don't really\nthink of it that way."},"638":{"dur":1,"text":"So in that case, I've\nbeen to a protest."},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"So I can change my answer."},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"HJ: I think on the\nwidgets as well,"},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"one of the reasons it\nchanged is because initially"},"646":{"dur":1,"text":"a lot of people,\nincluding myself,"},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"thought of a very narrow view\nof what a protest is-- going out"},"650":{"dur":1,"text":"with a placard or something."},"651":{"dur":3,"text":"But actually there's, as\nwe discovered together,"},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"that there's lots\nof different ways."},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"And actually, yeah, I\nhave been in a protest."},"658":{"dur":3,"text":"And I remember reading up\nonce about an ongoing protest"},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"in Germany where they didn't\ndestroy, but took down"},"664":{"dur":2,"text":"And the German court said,\noh, that's a legitimate form"},"667":{"dur":1,"text":"of protest against\nthat company, which"},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"is very interesting as well."},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"SOPHIE: Davin has suggested\nthat this event should"},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"count as a festival."},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"But in order to do\nso, as Stuart

watch."},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"So aye!"},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"HJ: Am I doing it?"},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"Does this count?"},"693":{"dur":1,"text":"SOPHIE: Does that

excellent."},"713":{"dur":1,"text":"All right."},"714":{"dur":3,"text":"So I wanted to also ask\nabout some of the we"},"717":{"dur":1,"text":"were talking about\nthis redo

as well."},"734":{"dur":1,"text":"So I guess there's\nthis whole sense"},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"that protests and\nreligious festivals"},"737":{"dur":1,"text":"happen in a time\nand space, and those"},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"will differ depending on where\nthat is and when that is."},"742":{"dur":0,"text":"Of course."},"743":{"dur":4,"text":"So maybe when people think\nabout religious festivals,"},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"or religious rituals, perhaps\nthe first things they think of"},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"are things like\nbaptisms, or marriages,"},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"or that kind of thing."},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"So if we expand our\nunderstanding of ritual,"},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"I think one of the\npeople watching"},"762":{"dur":1,"text":"suggested this was a
