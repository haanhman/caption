there."},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm not sure if you do or you don't."},"828":{"dur":6,"text":"If you read from Acts 21 all the way through\nActs 28, then you figure out exactly how Paul"},"834":{"dur":4,"text":"ended up in Rome where he's writing this letter\nto the church at Ephesus."},"838":{"dur":4,"text":"But let me just run through it real quick\nfor you without calling attention to every"},"842":{"dur":1,"text":"verse and chapter."},"844":{"dur":5,"text":"So Paul ends up coming back to Jerusalem because\nthe Holy Spirit led him to come back to Jerusalem."},"849":{"dur":5,"text":"While he is there he had with him a gentile\nnamed Trophimus who was an Ephesian, actually."},"854":{"dur":4,"text":"It's interesting that he's writing to the\nchurch at Ephesus here, he had Trophimus who"},"859":{"dur":1,"text":"was an Ephesian, a Gentile."},"860":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, while Paul was there, he went into the\nTemple but some of the Jews that were there"},"865":{"dur":4,"text":"accused him of bringing Trophimus into the\nTemple into the place where only the Jews"},"870":{"dur":1,"text":"go."},"871":{"dur":3,"text":"And he didn't do that, but they accused him\nof doing that, and they got in a huge uproar"},"874":{"dur":1,"text":"about the whole thing."},"876":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, what happened was Paul stopped them\nand began to share his testimony about what"},"880":{"dur":5,"text":"had happened in his life and the gospel that\nhe was now a servant to and that he was preaching."},"885":{"dur":3,"text":"And they were listening, the Scripture says\nall the Jews were listening intently, because"},"889":{"dur":3,"text":"they knew the kind of guy he was and that\nhe had come out of Judaism and that he was"},"893":{"dur":4,"text":"kind of Saul who studied under Gamaliel and\nhe was a stud when it came to the Law."},"897":{"dur":3,"text":"So they were listening very intently like\nokay, okay, okay until the very end of his"},"900":{"dur":5,"text":"talk when he said oh yeah, and this good news,\nit's also for non-Jews."},"905":{"dur":4,"text":"It's also for the Gentiles, and they were\nlike oh wow, let's get this guy."},"910":{"dur":3,"text":"So then they got the Romans involved and said\nyou need to arrest this guy, he's a humongous"},"914":{"dur":1,"text":"trouble-maker."},"915":{"dur":3,"text":"So the Romans snatched him up and they were\nabout to give him the business and Paul went,"},"918":{"dur":1,"text":"hey, you might want to hang on a second."},"920":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm actually a Roman citizen and they like\noh, so we probably shouldn't have arrested"},"924":{"dur":3,"text":"you, this is probably going to be bad, we\ndon't want to do that."},"927":{"dur":4,"text":"So they kind of took him and they kind of\nheld onto him, but they didn't punish him"},"932":{"dur":1,"text":"at that point."},"933":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, the Roman leaders figured out that the\nJews actually had a plan to kill Paul in the"},"938":{"dur":5,"text":"night, and so they got Paul out of there and\nthey moved him to a place called Caesarea."},"943":{"dur":4,"text":"And he was staying and imprisoned there in\na place that Herod had built right there on"},"948":{"dur":6,"text":"the sea and so while he was there he stood,\nhad to stand trial before Festus, which was"},"954":{"dur":3,"text":"the Roman governor at the time."},"957":{"dur":3,"text":"And before Festus he told him, he said hey,\nhere's what I'm here for, I don't really know"},"960":{"dur":3,"text":"why I'm here, but I'm blah, blah, blah and\nhe kind of told him the whole deal and even"},"964":{"dur":2,"text":"shared his testimony about how his life had\nbeen transformed."},"967":{"dur":4,"text":"Festus listened, seemed like he was inclined,\nbut he ended up not doing anything at all."},"971":{"dur":5,"text":"So Paul languished for two years there in\nCaesarea, without really anything going on,"},"977":{"dur":5,"text":"and then ultimately after Festus was gone\nFelix took his place, Felix the governor."},"983":{"dur":4,"text":"And when King Agrippa, who was king of the\nJews, came and visited Felix they both together"},"987":{"dur":4,"text":"heard Paul give his kind of defense of why\nhe was there, why he should be let go, and"},"991":{"dur":3,"text":"all those kinds of things and Paul ended appealing\nto Caesar."},"995":{"dur":3,"text":"And so they said, well, okay, then to Caesar\nyou will go."},"998":{"dur":4,"text":"So they put him on a guarded ship, and that\nship began to sail and make its way to Italy,"},"1003":{"dur":1,"text":"specifically they were headed to Rome."},"1005":{"dur":4,"text":"There was a lot that happened in between when\nyou start reading chapter 27 particularly"},"1009":{"dur":4,"text":"in the book of Acts, a lot happened in between,\nincluding shipwrecks and other things, but"},"1013":{"dur":1,"text":"then he finally made it to Rome."},"1015":{"dur":4,"text":"And here's what happened when he got to Rome,\nActs chapter 28 Luke tells us this \"When we"},"1020":{"dur":5,"text":"got to Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself,\nwith a soldier to guard him\"."},"1025":{"dur":2,"text":"In other words, he was under house-arrest."},"1028":{"dur":4,"text":"So he's writing the book of Ephesians, and\nhe's talking about the idea of the church,"},"1032":{"dur":3,"text":"he's talking about the purpose and the nature\nof the church and then how practically that"},"1036":{"dur":6,"text":"works out, and then at the very end of Ephesians\nhe makes a personal kind of request for those"},"1042":{"dur":6,"text":"that are reading this letter, that they would\npray for him, that he would speak the gospel"},"1049":{"dur":5,"text":"boldly as he should, because he knew he
