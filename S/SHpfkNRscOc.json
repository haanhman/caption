would really love to be able"},"390":{"dur":4,"text":"to solve, a big, a big question if you\nlike, is where DNA, despite being the"},"394":{"dur":4,"text":"thread of life, you can put it in a

a selection."},"437":{"dur":5,"text":"First of all a basic fact, genes make\nproteins, here is the chromosome, here is"},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"the sequence of the genes, there is

are\nrequired."},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"But how are only the right genes expressed\nin a cell type?"},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"This has been a question, a long

cells,\netcetera."},"466":{"dur":4,"text":"We, we approximate knowledge about it, but\nactually, there's an enormous amount to"},"470":{"dur":3,"text":"find out.\nMost of the genome is actually"},"474":{"dur":3,"text":"inaccessible.\nThis is this gray, it's rather difficult"},"477":{"dur":3,"text":"to look at this picture I think because\nthe DNA is gray and looks although it"},"481":{"dur":4,"text":"should be in the background but this is a\nnucleusome, the repeating unit of the, of"},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"the chromosome, if you like.\nThe fundamental repeating unit."},"488":{"dur":6,"text":"And the DNA clings to the outside of it.\nAnd proteins that want to make genes"},"495":{"dur":3,"text":"active, can't actually get at the

don't, by any means, have a"},"508":{"dur":4,"text":"full picture.\nProtein-coding DNA sequences are only 1%"},"512":{"dur":3,"text":"of our genome.\nSo, if you look at a piece of the human"},"516":{"dur":4,"text":"genome, you see these vertical stripes\ncorrespond to the bits of this gene that"},"521":{"dur":6,"text":"are separated from each other.\nIn fact genes are fragmented

junk."},"554":{"dur":4,"text":"It's particularly after the encode project\nwhich found lots of potential regulatory"},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"sequences throughout here.\nSo, this other DNA is doing stuff."},"563":{"dur":6,"text":"And perhaps, it's doing stuff that makes\nfor example, humans and other mammals far"},"570":{"dur":7,"text":"more complex than yeast.\nSo finally, there are questions almost"},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"sociological questions.\nDoes the environment have any impact on"},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"gene expression?\nAnd this is a, a question I'll allude to"},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"in a moment.\nBut it's not one that is the main subject"},"586":{"dur":5,"text":"to this, this talk.\nSo, I put in the title Epigenetics because"},"592":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm quite mine, our work is quite often\ndescribed as epigenetics."},"596":{"dur":4,"text":"It literally means above or in addition to\ngenetics."},"601":{"dur":4,"text":"But the definition has been controversial\nand I'm just going to skim somewhat"},"605":{"dur":5,"text":"lightheartedly over some of this because\nit's, it's at

vehemence."},"620":{"dur":5,"text":"So, let me just try to sort of consolidate\nthis."},"625":{"dur":6,"text":"The original epigenetics definition comes\nfrom Conrad Waddington, who was

reasons we"},"734":{"dur":4,"text":"don't, which I will, I will come back to\nactually, a little bit later."},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"And you get a patch of skin because the\ncell that originally inactivated the"},"742":{"dur":5,"text":"orange fur gene gave rise when it divided\nto cells that did exactly the same thing."},"748":{"dur":4,"text":"So, that was inherited.\nAll the gene or the, the DNA is still"},"752":{"dur":4,"text":"there in these cells, in, in the orange\nones, and the black ones, but there is"},"757":{"dur":5,"text":"difference that is inherited and that's\nepigenetic according to this definition."},"763":{"dur":4,"text":"So, heritable traits of this kind might be\ninfluenced by the environment."},"768":{"dur":6,"text":"And this is sort of revitalized that an\nancient argument about nature versus"},"775":{"dur":4,"text":"nurture, where nature is genetics, the\nidea that we're, our genes are, are in"},"779":{"dur":4,"text":"control and nurture is the opposite, the\nidea that our environment determines who"},"783":{"dur":3,"text":"we are.\nOf course, it's a mixture of both but"},"787":{"dur":5,"text":"epigenetics has given a, a, a new lease

epigenome?"},"863":{"dur":6,"text":"Well, here is a genome of a, of a cell.\nIt's, it's the chromosomes that were"},"870":{"dur":5,"text":"obviously designed for an experiment\nbecause there are fluorescent pinpoints"},"875":{"dur":2,"text":"here.\nIgnore those, that's a human chromosome"},"877":{"dur":3,"text":"compliment.\nIf you explode those chromosomes, you see"},"880":{"dur":4,"text":"beads on a string and this is that\nrepeating unit I referred to earlier, the"},"884":{"dur":3,"text":"nucleosome with the DNA going round the\noutside."},"887":{"dur":5,"text":"It looks like beads on a string.\nSo, the epigeno, epigenome refers to"},"893":{"dur":6,"text":"markings of those beads, of that string of\nbeads in such a way that the region, it is"},"900":{"dur":2,"text":"regionally, regionally adapted to its\nfunction."},"902":{"dur":5,"text":"So, for example, there can be a region\nwhere gene is stably ON, and there is a"},"907":{"dur":6,"text":"whole plethora of marks that appear that\nreinforce that decision."},"913":{"dur":4,"text":"And similarly stably here, a gene OFF,\nsuch as the black-coat gene in our

of"},"926":{"dur":5,"text":"epigenetics.\nSo, you have DNA methylation here where"},"932":{"dur":4,"text":"these methyl groups are added to the DNA.\nYou can't do much to DNA without changing"},"936":{"dur":4,"text":"its propterties, its important properties.\nAlmost, the only thing it seems you can do"},"941":{"dur":2,"text":"is put these methyl groups on and even\nthat is bad in a way."},"944":{"dur":6,"text":"I don't have time to go into, it causes an\nincrease in the frequency of mutations."},"950":{"dur":6,"text":"But the, by far, the most elaborate way of\nmarking the

basically ticketing"},"966":{"dur":2,"text":"entities that you can add chemical\ninformation to."},"969":{"dur":5,"text":"That the cells can write information in\nthe form of chemical alterations."},"974":{"dur":5,"text":"And so, you add this and, that says,\nstably ON or stably OFF."},"979":{"dur":4,"text":"Again, we have the broad outlines.\nWe can correlate quite a lot of these with"},"984":{"dur":4,"text":"activity and silence.\nBut if you were to ask exactly what each"},"988":{"dur":4,"text":"of these modifications does, we have,\nstill have a lot to learn."},"993":{"dur":4,"text":"So, if you like, it's the, epigenetics is\nthe structural adaptation of chromosomal"},"997":{"dur":4,"text":"regions so as to register signal, or\nperpetual, perpetuate altered activity"},"1002":{"dur":4,"text":"states.\nAnd importantly, proteins that read these"},"1006":{"dur":5,"text":"marks, write the marks, or erase the\nmarks, remove the marks are implicated
