and expand"},"39":{"dur":1,"text":"into these giant galaxies,"},"40":{"dur":1,"text":"and you get trillions of them."},"42":{"dur":2,"text":"And within these galaxies"},"44":{"dur":2,"text":"you get these enormous dust clouds."},"46":{"dur":1,"text":"And I want you to pay particular attention"},"48":{"dur":1,"text":"to the three little prongs"},"49":{"dur":1,"text":"in the center of this

so much dust,"},"66":{"dur":1,"text":"it comes together and it fuses"},"68":{"dur":3,"text":"and ignites a thermonuclear reaction."},"72":{"dur":0,"text":"And so what you're watching"},"73":{"dur":1,"text":"is the birth of stars."},"74":{"dur":1,"text":"These are stars being born out of here."},"76":{"dur":2,"text":"When enough stars come out,"},"79":{"dur":1,"text":"they

here."},"86":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"87":{"dur":1,"text":"And as you take a close-up of this galaxy,"},"89":{"dur":2,"text":"you find a relatively normal,"},"91":{"dur":2,"text":"not

over"},"105":{"dur":1,"text":"that it doesn't ignite into a star,"},"107":{"dur":2,"text":"it becomes a planet."},"109":{"dur":4,"text":"And this is about a little over four billion years

the really strange thing"},"134":{"dur":2,"text":"is life goes kaput, not once, not twice,"},"137":{"dur":2,"text":"but five times."},"139":{"dur":2,"text":"So almost all life on

percent of the time into this story,"},"160":{"dur":3,"text":"just to put ourselves and our ancestors in perspective."},"164":{"dur":3,"text":"So within that context, there's two theories of the case"},"167":{"dur":1,"text":"as to why we're all here."},"169":{"dur":1,"text":"The first theory of the case"},"171":{"dur":3,"text":"is that's all she wrote."},"174":{"dur":1,"text":"Under that theory,"},"175":{"dur":1,"text":"we are the be-all and end-all"},"177":{"dur":1,"text":"of all creation."},"179":{"dur":2,"text":"And the reason for trillions of galaxies,"},"182":{"dur":2,"text":"sextillions of planets,"},"184":{"dur":4,"text":"is to create something that looks like that"},"189":{"dur":3,"text":"and something that looks like that."},"192":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's the purpose of the universe;"},"194":{"dur":1,"text":"and then it flat-lines,"},"195":{"dur":1,"text":"it doesn't get any better."},"196":{"dur":4,"text":"(Laughter)"},"201":{"dur":2,"text":"The only question you might want to ask yourself is,"},"204":{"dur":5,"text":"could that be just mildly arrogant?"},"209":{"dur":1,"text":"And if it is --"},"211":{"dur":5,"text":"and particularly given the fact that we came very close to extinction."},"216":{"dur":3,"text":"There were only about 2,000 of our species left."},"219":{"dur":2,"text":"A few more weeks without rain,"},"221":{"dur":3,"text":"we would have never seen any of these."},"224":{"dur":6,"text":"(Laughter)"},"231":{"dur":4,"text":"(Applause)"},"236":{"dur":2,"text":"So maybe you have to think about a second theory"},"239":{"dur":2,"text":"if the first one isn't good enough."},"242":{"dur":1,"text":"Second theory is: Could we upgrade?"},"243":{"dur":2,"text":"(Laughter)"},"246":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, why would one ask a question like that?"},"250":{"dur":2,"text":"Because there have been at least 29 upgrades so far"},"252":{"dur":2,"text":"of humanoids."},"254":{"dur":2,"text":"So it turns out that we have upgraded."},"257":{"dur":1,"text":"We've upgraded time and again and again."},"259":{"dur":2,"text":"And it turns out that we keep discovering upgrades."},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"We found this one last year."},"264":{"dur":2,"text":"We found another one last month."},"267":{"dur":2,"text":"And as you're thinking about this,"},"269":{"dur":2,"text":"you might also ask the question:"},"271":{"dur":3,"text":"So why a single human species?"},"274":{"dur":1,"text":"Wouldn't it be really odd"},"276":{"dur":3,"text":"if you went to Africa and Asia and Antarctica"},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"and found exactly the same bird --"},"282":{"dur":3,"text":"particularly given that we co-existed at the same time"},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"with at least eight other versions of humanoid"},"289":{"dur":2,"text":"at the same time on this planet?"},"291":{"dur":1,"text":"So the normal state of affairs"},"293":{"dur":2,"text":"is not to have just a Homo sapiens;"},"296":{"dur":1,"text":"the normal state of affairs"},"297":{"dur":3,"text":"is to have various versions of humans walking around."},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"And if that is the normal state of affairs,"},"303":{"dur":2,"text":"then you might ask yourself,"},"306":{"dur":2,"text":"all right, so if we want to create something else,"},"308":{"dur":2,"text":"how big does a mutation have to be?"},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"Well Svante Paabo has the answer."},"313":{"dur":2,"text":"The difference between humans and Neanderthal"},"316":{"dur":3,"text":"is 0.004 percent of gene code."},"319":{"dur":1,"text":"That's how big the difference is"},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"one species to another."},"323":{"dur":4,"text":"This explains most contemporary political debates."},"328":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"330":{"dur":3,"text":"But as you're thinking about this,"},"333":{"dur":1,"text":"one of the interesting things"},"334":{"dur":3,"text":"is how small these mutations are and where they take place."},"338":{"dur":1,"text":"Difference human\/Neanderthal"},"339":{"dur":1,"text":"is sperm and testis,"},"341":{"dur":1,"text":"smell and skin."},"342":{"dur":1,"text":"And those are the specific genes"},"344":{"dur":2,"text":"that differ from one to the other."},"346":{"dur":3,"text":"So very small changes can have a big impact."},"349":{"dur":1,"text":"And as you're thinking about this,"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"we're continuing to mutate."},"353":{"dur":2,"text":"So about 10,000 years ago by the Black Sea,"},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"we had one mutation in one gene"},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"which led to blue eyes."},"361":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is continuing and continuing and continuing."},"365":{"dur":1,"text":"And as it continues,"},"366":{"dur":1,"text":"one of the things that's going to happen this year"},"368":{"dur":3,"text":"is we're going to discover the first 10,000 human genomes,"},"371":{"dur":3,"text":"because it's gotten cheap enough to do the gene sequencing."},"375":{"dur":1,"text":"And when we find these,"},"376":{"dur":2,"text":"we may find differences."},"379":{"dur":3,"text":"And by the way, this is not a debate that we're ready for,"},"382":{"dur":3,"text":"because we have really misused the science in this."},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"In the 1920s, we thought there were major differences between people."},"389":{"dur":3,"text":"That was partly based on Francis Galton's work."},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"He was Darwin's cousin."},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"But the U.S., the Carnegie Institute,"},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"Stanford, American Neurological Association"},"400":{"dur":1,"text":"took this really far."},"402":{"dur":3,"text":"That got exported and was really misused."},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact, it led to some absolutely horrendous"},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"treatment of human beings."},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"So since the 1940s, we've been saying there are no differences,"},"412":{"dur":1,"text":"we're all identical."},"414":{"dur":3,"text":"We're going to know at year end if that is true."},"417":{"dur":1,"text":"And as we think about that,"},"419":{"dur":1,"text":"we're actually beginning to find things"},"420":{"dur":3,"text":"like, do you have an ACE gene?"},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"Why would that matter?"},"426":{"dur":4,"text":"Because nobody's ever climbed an 8,000-meter peak without oxygen"},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"that doesn't have an ACE gene."},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"And if you want to get more specific,"},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"how about a 577R genotype?"},"437":{"dur":4,"text":"Well it turns out that every male Olympic power athelete ever tested"},"442":{"dur":3,"text":"carries at least one of these variants."},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"If that is true,"},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"it leads to some very complicated questions"},"449":{"dur":1,"text":"for the London Olympics."},"451":{"dur":1,"text":"Three options:"},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"Do you want the Olympics to be a showcase"},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"for really hardworking mutants?"},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"Option number two:"},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"Why don't we play it like golf or sailing?"},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"Because you have one and you don't have one,"},"468":{"dur":3,"text":"I'll give you a tenth of a second head start."},"472":{"dur":1,"text":"Version number three:"},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"Because this is a naturally occurring gene"},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"and you've got it and you didn't pick the right parents,"},"478":{"dur":3,"text":"you get the right to upgrade."},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"Three different options."},"484":{"dur":1,"text":"If these differences are the difference"},"486":{"dur":3,"text":"between an Olympic medal and a non-Olympic medal."},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"And it turns out that as we discover these things,"},"492":{"dur":3,"text":"we human beings really like to change"},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"how we look, how we act,"},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"what our bodies do."},"498":{"dur":4,"text":"And we had about 10.2 million plastic surgeries in the United States,"},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"except that with the technologies that are coming online today,"},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"today's corrections, deletions,"},"509":{"dur":1,"text":"augmentations and enhancements"},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"are going to seem like child's play."},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"You already saw the work by Tony Atala on TED,"},"517":{"dur":3,"text":"but this ability to start filling"},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"things like inkjet cartridges with cells"},"524":{"dur":4,"text":"are allowing us to print skin, organs"},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"and a whole series of other body parts."},"531":{"dur":1,"text":"And as these technologies go forward,"},"533":{"dur":3,"text":"you keep seeing this, you keep seeing this, you keep seeing things --"},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"2000, human genome sequence --"},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"and it seems like nothing's happening,"},"544":{"dur":3,"text":"until it does."},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"And we may just be in some of these weeks."},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"And as you're thinking about"},"552":{"dur":3,"text":"these two guys sequencing a human genome in 2000"},"555":{"dur":3,"text":"and the Public Project sequencing the human genome in 2000,"},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"then you don't hear a lot,"},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"until you hear about an experiment last year in China,"},"566":{"dur":4,"text":"where they take skin cells from this mouse,"},"570":{"dur":1,"text":"put four chemicals on it,"},"572":{"dur":3,"text":"turn those skin cells into stem cells,"},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"let the stem cells grow"},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"and create a full copy of that mouse."},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"That's a big deal."},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"Because in essence"},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"what it means is you can take a cell,"},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"which is a pluripotent stem cell,"},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"which is like a skier at the top of a mountain,"},"591":{"dur":3,"text":"and those two skiers become two pluripotent stem cells,"},"595":{"dur":1,"text":"four, eight, 16,"},"597":{"dur":1,"text":"and then it gets so crowded"},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"after 16 divisions"},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"that those cells have to differentiate."},"603":{"dur":1,"text":"So they go down one side of the mountain,"},"604":{"dur":1,"text":"they go down another."},"605":{"dur":1,"text":"And as they pick that,"},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"these become bone,"},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"and then they pick another road and these become platelets,"},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"and these become macrophages,"},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"and these become T cells."},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"But it's really hard, once you ski down,"},"617":{"dur":1,"text":"to get back up."},"619":{"dur":5,"text":"Unless, of course, if you have a ski lift."},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"And what those four chemicals do"},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"is they take any cell"},"629":{"dur":1,"text":"and take it way back up the mountain"},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"so it can become any body part."},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"And as you think of that,"},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"what it means is potentially"},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"you can rebuild a full copy"},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"of any organism"},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"out of any one of its cells."},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"That turns out to be a big deal"},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"because now you can take, not just mouse cells,"},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"but you can human skin cells"},"651":{"dur":3,"text":"and turn them into human stem cells."},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"And then what they did in October"},"657":{"dur":3,"text":"is they took skin cells, turned them into stem cells"},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"and began to turn them into liver cells."},"665":{"dur":1,"text":"So in theory,"},"666":{"dur":5,"text":"you could grow any organ from any one of your cells."},"671":{"dur":1,"text":"Here's a second experiment:"},"672":{"dur":3,"text":"If you could photocopy your body,"},"676":{"dur":3,"text":"maybe you also want to take your mind."},"679":{"dur":1,"text":"And one of the things you saw at TED"},"680":{"dur":1,"text":"about a year and a half ago"},"681":{"dur":1,"text":"was this guy."},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"And he gave a wonderful technical talk."},"686":{"dur":1,"text":"He's a professor at MIT."},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"But in essence what he said"},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"is you can take retroviruses,"},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"which get inside brain cells of mice."},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"You can tag them with proteins"},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"that light up when you light them."},"698":{"dur":3,"text":"And you can map the exact pathways"},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"when a mouse sees, feels, touches,"},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"remembers, loves."},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"And then you can take a fiber optic cable"},"710":{"dur":3,"text":"and light up some of the same things."},"714":{"dur":1,"text":"And by the way, as you do this,"},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"you can image it in two colors,"},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"which means you can download this information"},"720":{"dur":4,"text":"as binary code directly into a computer."},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"So what's the bottom line on that?"},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"Well it's not completely inconceivable"},"729":{"dur":4,"text":"that someday you'll be able to download your own memories,"},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"maybe into a new body."},"736":{"dur":5,"text":"And maybe you can upload other people's memories as well."},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"And this might have just one or two"},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"small ethical, political, moral implications."},"747":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"Just a thought."},"752":{"dur":1,"text":"Here's the kind of questions"},"753":{"dur":1,"text":"that are becoming interesting questions"},"755":{"dur":2,"text":"for philosophers, for governing people,"},"758":{"dur":3,"text":"for economists, for scientists."},"761":{"dur":3,"text":"Because these technologies are moving really quickly."},"764":{"dur":1,"text":"And as you think about it,"},"766":{"dur":3,"text":"let me close with an example of the brain."},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"The first place where you would expect"},"771":{"dur":3,"text":"to see enormous evolutionary pressure today,"},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"both because of the inputs,"},"776":{"dur":1,"text":"which are becoming massive,"},"778":{"dur":1,"text":"and because of the plasticity of the organ,"},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"is the brain."},"782":{"dur":3,"text":"Do we have any evidence that that is happening?"},"785":{"dur":4,"text":"Well let's take a look at something like autism incidence per thousand."},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"Here's what it looks like in 2000."},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"Here's what it looks like in 2002,"},"795":{"dur":4,"text":"2006, 2008."},"799":{"dur":4,"text":"Here's the increase in less than a decade."},"803":{"dur":4,"text":"And we still don't know why this is happening."},"808":{"dur":2,"text":"What we do know is, potentially,"},"810":{"dur":2,"text":"the brain is reacting in"},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"a hyperactive, hyper-plastic way,"},"814":{"dur":2,"text":"and creating individuals that are like this."},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is only one of the conditions that's out there."},"820":{"dur":3,"text":"You've also got people with who are extraordinarily smart,"},"824":{"dur":2,"text":"people who can remember everything they've seen in their lives,"},"826":{"dur":1,"text":"people who've got synesthesia,"},"827":{"dur":1,"text":"people who've got schizophrenia."},"829":{"dur":2,"text":"You've got all kinds of stuff going on out there,"},"831":{"dur":1,"text":"and we still don't understand"},"832":{"dur":2,"text":"how and why this is happening."},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"But one question you might want to ask is,"},"837":{"dur":2,"text":"are we seeing a rapid evolution of the brain"},"840":{"dur":1,"text":"and of how we process data?"},"842":{"dur":3,"text":"Because when you think of how much data's coming into our brains,"},"845":{"dur":3,"text":"we're trying to take in as much data in a day"},"848":{"dur":2,"text":"as people used to take in in a lifetime."},"851":{"dur":2,"text":"And as you're thinking about this,"},"854":{"dur":2,"text":"there's four theories as to why this might be going on,"},"856":{"dur":1,"text":"plus a whole series of others."},"857":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't have a good answer."},"859":{"dur":3,"text":"There really needs to be more research on this."},"862":{"dur":2,"text":"One option is the fast food fetish."},"865":{"dur":2,"text":"There's beginning to be some evidence"},"867":{"dur":2,"text":"that obesity and diet"},"869":{"dur":1,"text":"have something to do"},"871":{"dur":1,"text":"with gene modifications,"},"873":{"dur":2,"text":"which may or may not have an impact"},"875":{"dur":3,"text":"on how the brain of an infant works."},"879":{"dur":3,"text":"A second option is the sexy geek option."},"883":{"dur":4,"text":"These conditions are highly rare."},"887":{"dur":3,"text":"(Laughter)"},"890":{"dur":5,"text":"(Applause)"},"895":{"dur":1,"text":"But what's beginning to happen"},"897":{"dur":2,"text":"is because these geeks are all getting together,"},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"because they are highly qualified for computer programming"},"902":{"dur":2,"text":"and it is highly remunerated,"},"905":{"dur":3,"text":"as well as other very detail-oriented tasks,"},"908":{"dur":2,"text":"that they are concentrating geographically"},"910":{"dur":2,"text":"and finding like-minded mates."},"913":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is the assortative mating hypothesis"},"917":{"dur":2,"text":"of these genes reinforcing one another"},"919":{"dur":2,"text":"in these structures."},"922":{"dur":2,"text":"The third, is this too much information?"},"924":{"dur":1,"text":"We're trying to process so much stuff"},"926":{"dur":2,"text":"that some people get synesthetic"},"928":{"dur":2,"text":"and just have huge pipes that remember everything."},"931":{"dur":2,"text":"Other people get hyper-sensitive to the amount of information."},"934":{"dur":3,"text":"Other people react with various psychological conditions"},"938":{"dur":1,"text":"or reactions to this information."},"939":{"dur":2,"text":"Or maybe it's chemicals."},"942":{"dur":1,"text":"But when you see an increase"},"944":{"dur":2,"text":"of that order of magnitude in a condition,"},"946":{"dur":1,"text":"either you're not measuring it right"},"948":{"dur":2,"text":"or there's something going on very quickly,"},"950":{"dur":4,"text":"and it may be evolution in real time."},"954":{"dur":2,"text":"Here's the bottom line."},"957":{"dur":2,"text":"What I think we are doing"},"959":{"dur":1,"text":"is we're transitioning as a species."},"961":{"dur":5,"text":"And I didn't think this when Steve Gullans and I started writing together."},"966":{"dur":2,"text":"I think we're transitioning into Homo
