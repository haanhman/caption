to\nreplace than I thought."},"246":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean, I had had a general\nidea that energy was important,"},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"but until I started studying\nthe history of

energy,"},"260":{"dur":4,"text":"I didn't really have a sense\nthat this is the industry that"},"264":{"dur":1,"text":"powers every other industry."},"266":{"dur":3,"text":"So when energy is

up,\neverything goes up."},"293":{"dur":2,"text":"And at the same time, when\nI was studying the history,"},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"I realized that--"},"297":{"dur":3,"text":"I started asking, well, why\ndo we use some forms of energy"},"300":{"dur":0,"text":"relative to others?"},"301":{"dur":3,"text":"Because it was just an axiom\nthat we use gasoline for cars."},"304":{"dur":0,"text":"That's just there."},"305":{"dur":2,"text":"And we seem to use\nfossil fuels a lot."},"307":{"dur":1,"text":"But I realize there\nhas actually been"},"309":{"dur":3,"text":"enormous amounts of

different alternatives."},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"And the gasoline\ncar was the winner"},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"in a market that had\nethanol, which was--"},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"Henry Ford's first\ncars and ethanol car,"},"327":{"dur":1,"text":"and they had a battery\ncar, as we like"},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"to call it, an electric car."},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"And what I saw\nthroughout history"},"333":{"dur":3,"text":"was there were lots of\nways of producing energy,"},"337":{"dur":2,"text":"but it was very, very\ndifficult to make it cheap,"},"339":{"dur":4,"text":"plentiful, and reliable on a\nscale of billions of people."},"344":{"dur":4,"text":"And so what this made me start\nthinking about is when we're"},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"talking about replacing\nfossil fuels or the problems"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"of fossil fuels, is\nit possible that there"},"354":{"dur":2,"text":"are some unique benefits\nof fossil fuels,"},"356":{"dur":1,"text":"in terms of being\ncheap, plentiful,"},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"and reliable for\nbillions of people"},"360":{"dur":3,"text":"that we're not appreciating or\ntaking into account, just as we"},"364":{"dur":3,"text":"have to take into account any\npotential unique negatives"},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"of fossil fuels?"},"369":{"dur":1,"text":"But those I had heard about."},"371":{"dur":1,"text":"And so I started studying\nthe energy debate."},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"I got interested in this\nquestion of what form of energy"},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"is really best for human\nflourishing, or what"},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"forms or what policy?"},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"And I observed-- I\nthought, and this"},"381":{"dur":1,"text":"is from a philosophical\nperspective,"},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"I thought there are three\nbig problems with the energy"},"386":{"dur":1,"text":"debate, as it stands."},"388":{"dur":3,"text":"One is that it's biased."},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"And what I noticed was certain\nwith certain forms of energy,"},"394":{"dur":2,"text":"all I ever heard was\npositives, that would mainly"},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"be solar and wind,\nand then with others,"},"398":{"dur":1,"text":"all I ever heard was negatives."},"400":{"dur":3,"text":"But then when I researched the\ndifferent production processes,"},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"I found that it's actually\nfar more dangerous"},"405":{"dur":3,"text":"to mine for the raw materials\nin wind turbines, rare earth"},"408":{"dur":1,"text":"metals."},"409":{"dur":3,"text":"So that doesn't mean that\ncoal is better than wind,"},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"but it does mean that we're\nnot looking at negatives of one"},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"and we are looking at\nnegatives of another."},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"And if we're doing that,\nhow are we ever going"},"420":{"dur":1,"text":"to get to the right decision?"},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"So it would be like, for\nexample, with vaccines."},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"If you just were making\na decision about,"},"427":{"dur":3,"text":"do I vaccinate my\nchild and you only"},"430":{"dur":1,"text":"looked at the\nnegatives of vaccines."},"432":{"dur":2,"text":"You said, hey, vaccines\nhave side effects."},"435":{"dur":1,"text":"And you didn't look\nat the positives."},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, when would you ever\nvaccinate your child?"},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, never, because all you\ncould see were negatives."},"441":{"dur":1,"text":"But if you looked\nat both sides, you"},"443":{"dur":1,"text":"might come to a very\ndifferent conclusion."},"445":{"dur":3,"text":"So we can't be biased\nin our thinking."},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"Again, this is not about\nwhether fossil fuels"},"450":{"dur":1,"text":"are the right solution\nin a given context."},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"It's about what's\nthe framework we're"},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"going to use to make\nthese decisions based"},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"on the current facts and\nthen as facts change."},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"How can we have a\nframework that adapts?"},"461":{"dur":4,"text":"The second one is that it's not\nonly biased but it's sloppy."},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"So let's take the\nissue of CO2 levels."},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"There is a concern\nthat because CO2"},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"as a warming agent of sorts,\nit's a greenhouse gas,"},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"or technically, it's\nan infrared absorber,"},"475":{"dur":3,"text":"when we increased the level\nof CO2 in the atmosphere,"},"478":{"dur":1,"text":"we might expect it to\nhave a warming impact"},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's something that's\nimportant to study and to see"},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"how significant is this."},"484":{"dur":4,"text":"But what I found is when people\nwere talking about CO2 levels,"},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"they talked about\nit very sloppily."},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"They would just say\nthings like, do you"},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"believe that climate\nchange is real?"},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"But that doesn't really\nhelp me if I know--"},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"I could believe that CO2\nhas some impact but not"},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"a significant impact,\nor a significant impact"},"504":{"dur":1,"text":"but not a catastrophic impact."},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's going to make all\nthe difference in the world."},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"So for example, if you say,\noh, there's sea level rise."},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"CO2 levels contribute\nto sea level rise."},"515":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, is it a one\nfoot contribution"},"518":{"dur":5,"text":"in the next century, as one of\nthe major UN organization says?"},"523":{"dur":3,"text":"Or is at 20 feet, as Al Gore\nsays \"An Inconvenient Truth\"?"},"527":{"dur":4,"text":"Those magnitudes make an\nenormous, enormous difference."},"532":{"dur":1,"text":"So to use the vaccines\nexample again,"},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"it would be like you're deciding\nwhether to vaccinate your child"},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"and somebody says to you-- and\nyou say, well, how significant"},"540":{"dur":0,"text":"are the side effects?"},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"And they just say vaccine\nside effects are real."},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"And you say, I know, but I\nwant to know the magnitude."},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"And they say, what are you,\na vaccine side effect denier?"},"549":{"dur":1,"text":"Don't question me."},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"Or maybe they would call\nit body change, right?"},"553":{"dur":1,"text":"Are you a body change denier?"},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"Body change is real."},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"And you think, but this is\nnot a helpful way of thinking."},"558":{"dur":1,"text":"This is sloppy."},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"What I want is I want\nthe full context."},"563":{"dur":1,"text":"I want to know the\npositives and negatives"},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"and I want to know\nthe magnitudes."},"567":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's biased and it's sloppy."},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"Now the third thing, and this\nis the most controversial,"},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"and for me, the\nmost important, is"},"576":{"dur":4,"text":"that I think the debate\nis extremely anti-human."},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"So one form in\nwhich I observe this"},"583":{"dur":3,"text":"is the issue of CO2,\ngreenhouse gases."},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"You have many people\nin our culture saying"},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"that this is the biggest\nproblem of our time,"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"that we're increasing the\namount of CO2 in the atmosphere"},"596":{"dur":3,"text":"by producing the form of energy\nthat we dominantly produce."},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"So you would think that priority\nnumber one would be, OK, let's"},"602":{"dur":4,"text":"find the most efficient,\nscalable ways on that premise"},"606":{"dur":3,"text":"to produce non-CO2\nemitting energy."},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"And then if you look, there\nare two overwhelming forms"},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"of energy,\nhistorically, that can"},"613":{"dur":3,"text":"do this in a relatively cheap,\nplentiful, and reliable way,"},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"to some extent,\nhydroelectric power, which"},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"can do it where you can\ndo it, but you can't you"},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"can't do it everywhere\nbut it's significant,"},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"and then nuclear power, which,\nat least for electricity,"},"626":{"dur":3,"text":"theoretically, you\ncan do anywhere."},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I observe, OK, who\nare the biggest opponents"},"632":{"dur":1,"text":"of these forms of power?"},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"Who are the people who\nmost want to stop them?"},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's not the\nfossil fuel industry."},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not Republicans."},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not even Donald Trump."},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"It's the anti-fossil\nfuel movement, the vast,"},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"vast majority of people who\nare against fossil fuels"},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"in the public debate--"},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"I know it's a little different\nin the tech community-- are"},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"rabidly anti-nuclear."},"655":{"dur":1,"text":"And when I looked at\ntheir arguments, well"},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"they say, oh, we\ncare about safety."},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think, well,\nwouldn't you be willing,"},"661":{"dur":1,"text":"even if there were\nsome safety risks,"},"663":{"dur":1,"text":"wouldn't you be willing\nto accept those,"},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"if you could save the\nworld on your own premise?"},"668":{"dur":1,"text":"And then I look at\nthe safety stats"},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"and by far, the safest\nform of power ever devised"},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"is nuclear power, which you\ncan ask questions about later,"},"675":{"dur":1,"text":"and the same thing with\nhydro, and I realized"},"677":{"dur":1,"text":"on what's going on here."},"678":{"dur":3,"text":"With hydro, people are using\nexplanations like, well,"},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"they're interfering with\nfree-flowing rivers,"},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"and with nuclear,\nwell, it's just--"},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"we shouldn't-- it's unnatural."},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, it creates\nthis radioactivity."},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"And you say, OK,\nwell, radioactivity"},"690":{"dur":0,"text":"exists everywhere."},"691":{"dur":0,"text":"What's wrong that?"},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's like, no, but\nwe shouldn't make it."},"694":{"dur":3,"text":"And what I got is-- and\nthis is from philosophy--"},"697":{"dur":3,"text":"the goal, then, the goal\nthat's animating this is not,"},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"let's do what's best\nfor human beings."},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"It's let's be natural."},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's not interrupt nature."},"708":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's be green."},"709":{"dur":5,"text":"And I summarize it this way,\nlet's minimize human impact."},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"So it seems like many people\nwhen they're discussing"},"717":{"dur":4,"text":"this issue, they're not\ntrying to do what I would say"},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"is the goal, is to\nmaximize human flourishing,"},"723":{"dur":3,"text":"to come up with the best\npolicy for human beings."},"726":{"dur":3,"text":"We're talking about\nminimizing impact."},"730":{"dur":3,"text":"And even the way we talk\nabout climate reveals this,"},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"because we don't talk about\nclimate danger or climate"},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"livability, which\nare human terms."},"739":{"dur":4,"text":"We talk about climate change,\nas if change, as such, is bad."},"744":{"dur":4,"text":"And so this is an\nanti-impact idea."},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"It's the idea that we\nshould not impact nature."},"751":{"dur":1,"text":"We should minimize our impact."},"752":{"dur":1,"text":"Not because it\nhurts us, but just"},"754":{"dur":1,"text":"because we shouldn't do it."},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's important to make\na decision in our framework,"},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"are we prioritizing\nhuman beings or not?"},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think it's\nimportant, then, to study."},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"There are basically\ntwo perspectives."},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"So the minimum\nimpact perspective"},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"has a certain view\nof the relationship"},"771":{"dur":1,"text":"between humans and nature."},"772":{"dur":2,"text":"And I call it the\nperfect planet premise."},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"And the perfect planet premise\nis that nature is, sorry,"},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"stable, safe, and sufficient."},"782":{"dur":4,"text":"So by its nature, nature is\nstable, safe, and sufficient,"},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"and it will take care of us."},"789":{"dur":1,"text":"Mother nature is\nreally our mother."},"791":{"dur":2,"text":"It will take care\nof us if we just"},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"don't rock the boat too much,\nif we don't change things,"},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"if we don't destabilize it."},"798":{"dur":5,"text":"But we have this capacity\nof changing things a lot,"},"803":{"dur":2,"text":"and we're generally regarded\nas polluter parasites."},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"When you hear people talk about\nhuman environmental impact,"},"808":{"dur":0,"text":"they don't say--"},"809":{"dur":1,"text":"they never think of\nthat as a good thing."},"811":{"dur":1,"text":"It's always a bad thing."},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"But you never hear anyone\ntalk about bear impact"},"814":{"dur":2,"text":"as a bad thing or beaver\nimpact as a bad thing."},"817":{"dur":4,"text":"So human beings are considered\nthis uniquely anti-planet"},"822":{"dur":4,"text":"creature who just basically\nwe pollute it, the planet,"},"826":{"dur":1,"text":"And if that's your\nview, if you really"},"828":{"dur":1,"text":"believe that mother\nnature is our mother"},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"and that the planet is\nperfect the way it is,"},"832":{"dur":2,"text":"or the way it was\nwithout us, then yeah,"},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"your goal should be let's\njust not touch anything"},"837":{"dur":1,"text":"and it will be like\nthe Garden of Eden."},"839":{"dur":3,"text":"But this is really how we\nhear people talk about things."},"842":{"dur":1,"text":"We talk about the\nclimate, as in,"},"844":{"dur":3,"text":"the perfect climate as the\none that we grew up in."},"848":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, the perfectible\nplanet premise--"},"849":{"dur":1,"text":"and this is my premise--"},"851":{"dur":1,"text":"is very different."},"852":{"dur":4,"text":"So this views the planet\nas not stable, but dynamic,"},"856":{"dur":4,"text":"not safe but dangerous, not\nsufficient but deficient."},"861":{"dur":2,"text":"So it says the planet\nis an amazing place."},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"Its got amazing\npotential, but without us"},"866":{"dur":2,"text":"with radically\ntransforming it, we're"},"869":{"dur":1,"text":"going to have life\nexpectancies of 30."},"871":{"dur":2,"text":"We're going to be at\nthe mercy of nature."},"873":{"dur":3,"text":"So our attitude needs\nto be, let's perfect it."},"877":{"dur":1,"text":"We are perfecter producers."},"879":{"dur":2,"text":"So we can make things worse."},"882":{"dur":4,"text":"We can also make things\na lot, lot better."},"886":{"dur":2,"text":"And so the goal of\nsomeone on this premise"},"888":{"dur":2,"text":"is to maximize human\nflourishing through"},"891":{"dur":2,"text":"intelligent transformation."},"893":{"dur":1,"text":"So I describe my\nframework, if you"},"895":{"dur":3,"text":"want two terms would\nbe full

the\ngreenhouse effect,"},"2404":{"dur":2,"text":"I think, and it's\nreally important"},"2406":{"dur":1,"text":"because what's happened\nis, because there's"},"2408":{"dur":1,"text":"more CO2 in
