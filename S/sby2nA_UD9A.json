championships,"},"569":{"dur":4,"text":"any team like that, I notice\nthey work really hard, right?"},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"So whether\nit's practice,"},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"whether it's

today,"},"624":{"dur":5,"text":"one of their next steps is\nto think about next year."},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"Because any time you\nhave a team like that,"},"631":{"dur":3,"text":"that works that
