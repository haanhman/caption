a joke, okay."},"88":{"dur":1,"text":"Write that down."},"91":{"dur":3,"text":"So one of the other things we recognize as entrepreneurs"},"94":{"dur":3,"text":"was that no business plan survived first

didn't even have a language"},"124":{"dur":1,"text":"to distinguish the two."},"127":{"dur":3,"text":"So when I retired after doing eight of these,"},"131":{"dur":4,"text":"I started to contemplate,

this."},"141":{"dur":4,"text":"Startups Are Not Smaller Versions of Large Companies."},"146":{"dur":3,"text":"This believe it or not, which seems like duh,"},"150":{"dur":2,"text":"was a heretical

them."},"219":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I realized that startups needed their own tools,"},"223":{"dur":3,"text":"different from those used in existing companies."},"226":{"dur":4,"text":"And so we came

believing"},"277":{"dur":2,"text":"that because you implicitly think you understand"},"280":{"dur":3,"text":"the problem on day one, you take some money and you go"},"283":{"dur":3,"text":"build the solution and you ship the product."},"287":{"dur":1,"text":"And the smarter you are,"},"289":{"dur":3,"text":"the deeper the hole you tend to dig."},"293":{"dur":3,"text":"One of the things I've learned painfully is that"},"297":{"dur":3,"text":"as smart as you are, there is no way you're smarter"},"300":{"dur":1,"text":"than the collective intelligence of

it?"},"347":{"dur":4,"text":"That's selling, I mean getting out and understanding"},"352":{"dur":3,"text":"deeply what are the customer problems,"},"355":{"dur":3,"text":"what are their needs and what kind of solution"},"360":{"dur":1,"text":"might actually solve them."},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"And so not only do you talk to those customers,"},"364":{"dur":3,"text":"you build something called minimum viable products,"},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"because the third piece of Lean is using"},"370":{"dur":3,"text":"agile engineering to instead of specing an entire"},"374":{"dur":3,"text":"solution and then building it and shipping it"},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"and finding out people don't want it,"},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"you build the product incrementally and iteratively"},"382":{"dur":3,"text":"and you continually interact with those customers"},"386":{"dur":3,"text":"trying to understand whether you're on the right track."},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"These three components, business model design,"},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"customer development and agile engineering"},"395":{"dur":1,"text":"is the Lean Startup."}}
