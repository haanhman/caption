how does a three-year-old pretend they're flying?"},"371":{"dur":3,"text":"Can you guys act it out, can everyone act it out together?"},"374":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah.\n(Tina laughs)"},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"So we took that behavior"},"378":{"dur":2,"text":"and then we give them these little wings,"},"380":{"dur":3,"text":"and then when he tilts this way, he goes that

fun!"},"395":{"dur":1,"text":"So how did you come up with that idea?"},"397":{"dur":1,"text":"Or how did your group come up with that idea?"},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"- By watching kids, and then someone would pretend"},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"they're flying and remembering they did it themselves"},"403":{"dur":3,"text":"and said, how do we incorporate that into a toy?"},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"And then the way we prototyped that was,"},"409":{"dur":3,"text":"we had that and someone behind the curtain driving it"},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"when the kid did this, we turned it that way."},"415":{"dur":1,"text":"So that saved us some money on the prototyping."},"416":{"dur":1,"text":"(audience laughs)\n- Well I love that idea."},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"- Then, once we sold it, then we had to make it work."},"420":{"dur":1,"text":"(audience chuckles)"},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"- But that's what's really cool, and I am so fascinated"},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"with the way you do that, is do these really,"},"426":{"dur":3,"text":"really quick and dirty, inexpensive prototypes"},"430":{"dur":1,"text":"that test whether a concept will work"},"432":{"dur":1,"text":"without actually spending any money"},"434":{"dur":1,"text":"or even putting any technology into it."},"436":{"dur":1,"text":"So, talk about that process."},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"- That's a real tenet of IDEO,"},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"it's a real tenet of the d.School."},"440":{"dur":3,"text":"It's high-fidelity thinking, low-fidelity prototyping."},"443":{"dur":3,"text":"'Cause you want rough-and-rapid to get the idea out there"},"447":{"dur":3,"text":"so you can learn from it, not test to validate."},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"Get it out there to learn from it"},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"and so you can make it better."},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"For those of you who will start running companies someday,"},"457":{"dur":4,"text":"what you want is when your CEO to have that ability"},"462":{"dur":1,"text":"to squint and see the real thing"},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"through a rough-and-rapid model,"},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"'cause we see so many cultures"},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"that the model prototype has to be beautiful"},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"before they show it to the CEO or management,"},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"because they're going, \"What's this piece of crap?\""},"475":{"dur":1,"text":"Your whole culture then understands,"},"476":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Ooh, we gotta make it look good,\""},"478":{"dur":1,"text":"and they're wasting all this time."},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"- Right, and of course I understand in that situation,"},"481":{"dur":1,"text":"you're much less likely to get feedback,"},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"you now are fully committed to something that might not work"},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"so doing these really quick prototypes is really valuable."},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"- It's a culture, it's a culture thing."},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"And you can do that physical or digital."},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"You love the example where we were working"},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"with Sesame Street, we've done a whole bunch of apps"},"499":{"dur":1,"text":"with Sesame Street digital toys"},"500":{"dur":4,"text":"and we were trying to figure out how Elmo does his dance."},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"Sesame's in New York, my team's here, and we didn't want"},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"to do any programming yet, so the team had a clever idea:"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"they plotted out an iPhone this big"},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"and then glued it to a foam core, cut the hole out"},"518":{"dur":3,"text":"and then acted out the scene with a live actor behind it."},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"The interaction was someone touching; you touch this button"},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"and Elmo dances like this, and we could do that"},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"and then shoot a video in a morning,"},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"we went back and forth three or four times"},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"before we had to do any software."},"531":{"dur":1,"text":"So that was a really low-fidelity way"},"533":{"dur":1,"text":"to do digital, too, which is cool."},"535":{"dur":0,"text":"- Yeah, I love that."},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that it's called Monster Maker, right?"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"And I love the fact that in a really short time,"},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"without any technology, basically no money,"},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"and you were able to really get some great feedback"},"546":{"dur":0,"text":"on the concept."},"547":{"dur":1,"text":"Great.\n- Yeah."},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"- One of the things that's super interesting about toys"},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"is that they often foreshadow the technology"},"554":{"dur":3,"text":"that we're gonna be adapting as adults in our lives."},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"How do you try to anticipate what's gonna be happening"},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"in the real world and then adapt that to toys?"},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"- Well, my team's really lucky,"},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"'cause IDEO's working in almost every industry,"},"568":{"dur":3,"text":"so we can see what's happening in transportation"},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"and we can see what's happening in consumer products"},"574":{"dur":3,"text":"and we can see what's happening in health."},"578":{"dur":3,"text":"We did a $300 Barbie Hello Dreamhouse"},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"that was out this Christmas, 300 bucks."},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"That's good if you're an inventor, it's a lot of royalties."},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"(audience chuckles)"},"590":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's a smart Dreamhouse, all this cool smart technology"},"594":{"dur":3,"text":"in it, and we'd been working on smart houses for a long time"},"597":{"dur":4,"text":"at IDEO, but for billionaires and other types of folks."},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"And all this sort of stuff, like the Nest and other stuff,"},"605":{"dur":3,"text":"is recognizing your behavior versus programming,"},"609":{"dur":0,"text":"no one wants to program."},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"So we put all this same thinking"},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"into this cool Barbie house, it was awesome."},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"It was on Jimmy Fallon, which was really funny."},"616":{"dur":0,"text":"- So see, really, it's not expensive,"},"617":{"dur":1,"text":"I can get a whole house for $300!"},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"For 300 bucks, try that in Palo Alto somewhere, right?"},"622":{"dur":1,"text":"(audience laughs)"},"623":{"dur":1,"text":"Put it on a piece of land."},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, so that's an interesting point,"},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"is that for $300 I can get a real house."},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"Do you use this, actually, as a way to test concepts"},"632":{"dur":1,"text":"for real products in the real world?"},"634":{"dur":1,"text":"Are toys a foreshadowing?"},"636":{"dur":3,"text":"- Toys is kind of a foreshadowing, because"},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"pretty fast in the marketplace, and a lot of technology"},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"finds it way in toys in a hurry."},"646":{"dur":3,"text":"RFID was in toys in a hurry, different colored LEDs"},"649":{"dur":3,"text":"were in toys in a hurry, just because toys don't last long."},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"You buy a refrigerator, it's gonna be there for 15 years,"},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"so that technology, it's hard to keep updating on that"},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"in a hurry, but toys have such a short life"},"661":{"dur":1,"text":"and they're a lot more physical,"},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"so you'll see this technology in there,"},"665":{"dur":1,"text":"which is pretty interesting."},"666":{"dur":0,"text":"- Very cool."},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"So, can you tell us a little bit about the relationship"},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"you have with the manufacturers, who, I assume,"},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"are also the distributors, right?"},"675":{"dur":1,"text":"- We have great long-term relationships"},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"with Mattel and Hasbro and Fisher-Price"},"680":{"dur":3,"text":"and any of the big toy companies, Moose and..."},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"Who's got kids here, anybody?"},"685":{"dur":2,"text":"So, if you have a three-year-old"},"688":{"dur":3,"text":"or a five-year-old daughter, you know what Shopkins is."},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Audience Member] Are you the guy?"},"693":{"dur":0,"text":"- No."},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"(audience laughs)"},"695":{"dur":3,"text":"But I know the guy, but it's a brand that went from zero"},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"to almost a billions dollars."},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"We do have a Shopkins item called the Shopkins Tall Mall,"},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"it's like a Dreamhouse."},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"But yeah, these are long term relationships,"},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"these are our customers, so to speak,"},"709":{"dur":3,"text":"and there's always tension there, because Mattel has"},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"a huge design department,"},"716":{"dur":4,"text":"but the market forces are such that there are about a third"},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"of all new toys are licensed from the outside."},"724":{"dur":1,"text":"Toy industry's been looking outside for ideas"},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"a lot longer than other industries."},"729":{"dur":0,"text":"A little bit open to innovation,"},"730":{"dur":1,"text":"but with known innovation partners,"},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"like my company and others."},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"So, it's interesting, because they can't tell you"},"738":{"dur":2,"text":"exactly what they want, 'cause they'd tell their own team,"},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"but they're looking, and you start to understand,"},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"you start to get some really good institutional knowledge."},"745":{"dur":3,"text":"I've been visiting these guys for 20 years,"},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"so I know their history, know their product line"},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"and kinda know where they should be fishing, so to speak."},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"- So are the toy manufacturers and distributors,"},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"like Mattel, are they like venture capitalists,"},"762":{"dur":1,"text":"that there, you go in and pitch them"},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"and then they say yes or say no?"},"766":{"dur":4,"text":"- Kinda, it's much more like a screenplay or royalty deal;"},"771":{"dur":3,"text":"they'll publish your work, so to speak."},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're an author, you'll get a royalty on a book."},"777":{"dur":1,"text":"Although people care who wrote a book;"},"778":{"dur":1,"text":"they don't necessarily care"},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"if IDEO invented a toy or not, unfortunately."},"784":{"dur":0,"text":"- Yeah, but they might say,"},"785":{"dur":1,"text":"\"I want something like Sesame Street.\""},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"- But it's a long-term relationship."},"789":{"dur":1,"text":"I got some really good advice from an inventor"},"791":{"dur":1,"text":"when I first started, he said,"},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"\"It's important to you to sell something,"},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"\"but it's more important you get invited back"},"796":{"dur":1,"text":"\"to the meeting.\""},"799":{"dur":0,"text":"'Cause if you don't get invited back,"},"800":{"dur":2,"text":"you're not gonna have a sustainable business,"},"802":{"dur":3,"text":"'cause if you go in and burn your bridges on one deal,"},"806":{"dur":1,"text":"you'll throw it."},"807":{"dur":1,"text":"- Do you find that you're often working"},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"on the same projects, the type of things that they are,"},"811":{"dur":3,"text":"and so you have intellectual property issues?"},"814":{"dur":1,"text":"- Uh-Huh, exactly."},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a relationship built on long-term trust,"},"819":{"dur":2,"text":"so if they say, \"We're working on something very similar,\""},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"we'll take their word for it."},"824":{"dur":2,"text":"Because they're not gonna try to rip us off"},"826":{"dur":3,"text":"because there's a tension, they want us to come back too."},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"But we all see the same things in the marketplace,"},"833":{"dur":1,"text":"we were exposed to similar ideas,"},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"and sometimes things are..."},"838":{"dur":1,"text":"- The same ideas bubble up to the top."},"840":{"dur":0,"text":"- Yeah, exactly."},"841":{"dur":2,"text":"- So, let's go back into the lab"},"843":{"dur":1,"text":"where you're designing all this."},"845":{"dur":2,"text":"What makes something fun?"},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yeah, that's a really interesting question."},"852":{"dur":3,"text":"It has to have an element of surprise, of delight,"},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"it has to meet some kind of..."},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"It's best if it's based on some kinda insight,"},"861":{"dur":3,"text":"and insight could just be it wants to be fun, right."},"864":{"dur":2,"text":"Like, the plane had that element of magic"},"867":{"dur":3,"text":"'cause it felt like you're actually flying."},"871":{"dur":2,"text":"Let me show you another toy."},"873":{"dur":1,"text":"This is a..."},"876":{"dur":0,"text":"You haven't jumped to failure

fun."},"894":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yeah, I thought that was great."},"896":{"dur":2,"text":"(audience laughs)"},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"This was early in my career, at Mattel,"},"902":{"dur":1,"text":"in a conference room,"},"904":{"dur":1,"text":"I think it was one of my first meetings with them,"},"905":{"dur":1,"text":"and there were five or six execs there"},"906":{"dur":2,"text":"and they're all

it's not working, and I'm feeling like, \"Oh no.\""},"915":{"dur":2,"text":"So I just try to jiggle it and then I swing it,"},"918":{"dur":3,"text":"and (laughs) it just threw bubble stuff out"},"921":{"dur":0,"text":"(Tina laughs)"},"922":{"dur":2,"text":"and laced them across the suits."},"925":{"dur":1,"text":"(audience laughs)"},"926":{"dur":1,"text":"And they looked at me like, \"Are you goofing on me?\""},"928":{"dur":1,"text":"(Tina laughs)"},"929":{"dur":1,"text":"That was a huge failure."},"931":{"dur":1,"text":"(audience laughs)"},"932":{"dur":2,"text":"I was very polite and wrote them each a sorry note,"},"935":{"dur":1,"text":"so I got invited back."},"937":{"dur":3,"text":"I went back and fixed it and then we sold it"},"940":{"dur":2,"text":"to another company, and it came out"},"943":{"dur":1,"text":"and it had a really cool commercial"},"944":{"dur":3,"text":"and was doing really well, and then there's,"},"948":{"dur":1,"text":"I think it's

no, you never know 'til the scorecard's out"},"982":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's in the marketplace."},"984":{"dur":2,"text":"People may love it and it's got a ton of tooling"},"987":{"dur":2,"text":"and advertising and then it still doesn't do well,"},"989":{"dur":1,"text":"so that's always surprising."},"991":{"dur":2,"text":"Or, it's like, \"Wow, this did five times

process:"},"1094":{"dur":2,"text":"there's inspiration, so you gotta get inspired,"},"1097":{"dur":1,"text":"see something your competitors aren't seeing;"},"1098":{"dur":1,"text":"then there's

water."},"1117":{"dur":2,"text":"But for us, brainstorming's a really great tool"},"1119":{"dur":1,"text":"that we know how to use."},"1121":{"dur":1,"text":"So I think it gets a bad rap"},"1123":{"dur":2,"text":"because people that just read the rules and try it once"},"1125":{"dur":2,"text":"don't actually know how to do it."},"1130":{"dur":3,"text":"I think it's your analogy around if you put four people"},"1133":{"dur":1,"text":"in a room and they know how to play musical instruments,"},"1135":{"dur":1,"text":"they can jam pretty well."},"1136":{"dur":1,"text":"But if you put four people who don't know how to play,"},"1138":{"dur":2,"text":"it's not gonna sound very good at all."},"1141":{"dur":2,"text":"So, if you are practiced at brainstorming,"},"1143":{"dur":1,"text":"you understand it, you're gonna get better at it,"},"1145":{"dur":1,"text":"it's a muscle."},"1148":{"dur":2,"text":"If you think about ideation too, it's

making decisions and understanding how to get"},"1163":{"dur":1,"text":"to the answer in a hurry."},"1165":{"dur":2,"text":"Divergent thinking is just like, how do you keep your brain"},"1167":{"dur":3,"text":"going wide and ridiculous ideas and all sorts of crazy ideas"},"1171":{"dur":3,"text":"because that's where you're gonna find a good idea."},"1175":{"dur":1,"text":"If you're really close to being ridiculous,"},"1176":{"dur":3,"text":"it probably could be brilliant, otherwise it's just okay."},"1180":{"dur":2,"text":"So getting in that mode, and then there's confusion around,"},"1183":{"dur":2,"text":"folks think creative people are only divergent,"},"1185":{"dur":1,"text":"they're just constantly."},"1186":{"dur":2,"text":"No, they know when to turn it

one of the big problems, right?"},"1195":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're actually evaluating the ideas too early,"},"1198":{"dur":0,"text":"you kill them."},"1199":{"dur":2,"text":"Can you talk about how you get people ready"},"1202":{"dur":3,"text":"for a brainstorming session, where they can be as prepared"},"1205":{"dur":1,"text":"for divergent thinking as possible?"},"1206":{"dur":4,"text":"- When we bring in new folks, we sorta indoctrinate them"},"1210":{"dur":1,"text":"a little bit at a time."},"1212":{"dur":2,"text":"You put them in with a bunch of good brainstormers"},"1214":{"dur":3,"text":"so they see that behavior and they know how it's working."},"1217":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's one way."},"1219":{"dur":1,"text":"Before we go into the brainstorm, you have to have"},"1221":{"dur":1,"text":"your question; it's all around the right question,"},"1222":{"dur":2,"text":"so we've got the insights, we've got the question."},"1224":{"dur":1,"text":"But we'll do a lot of list-making."},"1226":{"dur":2,"text":"A lot of list-making gets your brain just rapid-fire,"},"1229":{"dur":3,"text":"so a lot of list-making, and then we'll--"},"1233":{"dur":4,"text":"- Just double-click on that, give me an example of a list."},"1239":{"dur":2,"text":"- Let's say we're inventing a car for travel."},"1242":{"dur":2,"text":"Plane, car, transportation."},"1245":{"dur":2,"text":"What do people do on planes?"},"1247":{"dur":1,"text":"Types of play, all these kinds of things;"},"1249":{"dur":1,"text":"just lists, lists."},"1251":{"dur":3,"text":"What do kids do for fun, what do kids do that's stupid?"},"1254":{"dur":3,"text":"Just, how do you do this list in a hurry?"},"1257":{"dur":2,"text":"That gets your brain rapid-firing."},"1261":{"dur":0,"text":"Then,"},"1263":{"dur":4,"text":"we'll discover something that works really well,"},"1267":{"dur":2,"text":"then we'll say, let's do a couple minutes"},"1269":{"dur":1,"text":"of heads-down time."},"1270":{"dur":1,"text":"Sketch up two or three ideas."},"1272":{"dur":3,"text":"We're huge Post-it users, by the way."},"1276":{"dur":1,"text":"People come in and think, \"You guys are nuts,\""},"1278":{"dur":2,"text":"but it's a way you can cluster in teams."},"1280":{"dur":1,"text":"So then we'll do a couple minutes of heads-down time,"},"1282":{"dur":2,"text":"sketch up two or three ideas, which is, we've found,"},"1284":{"dur":2,"text":"really good for some of the introverts,"},"1287":{"dur":2,"text":"so they can get some ideas down."},"1289":{"dur":0,"text":"And then people start to share,"},"1290":{"dur":2,"text":"then riff and build off them."},"1292":{"dur":1,"text":"- So that's really interesting, I was gonna ask you"},"1294":{"dur":4,"text":"about the trade-off between individual time and team time."},"1299":{"dur":4,"text":"Do you find that when people brainstorm by themselves"},"1304":{"dur":2,"text":"and then come back, that they're very wedded"},"1307":{"dur":1,"text":"to their own idea?"},"1309":{"dur":2,"text":"- No, we don't give much time for that."},"1312":{"dur":2,"text":"It's just to get a few ideas out of your head right away,"},"1315":{"dur":1,"text":"and then we're all gonna build on it."},"1316":{"dur":1,"text":"And we're very clear at a brainstorm"},"1318":{"dur":2,"text":"to let anyone new in the room know"},"1321":{"dur":1,"text":"that these ideas are all the group's ideas."},"1323":{"dur":3,"text":"It wouldn't exist if everyone wasn't here."},"1327":{"dur":4,"text":"It's not just one musician in the band, it's everyone."},"1331":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're careful not to call that Tina's idea"},"1334":{"dur":1,"text":"or Brendan's idea, we'll number the ideas"},"1335":{"dur":1,"text":"so you can go to the numbers."},"1337":{"dur":1,"text":"And then we'll have a little mini-goal,"},"1338":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Let's get 50 ideas,\""},"1340":{"dur":2,"text":"and that flips everything around people's heads."},"1342":{"dur":1,"text":"- So, obviously brainstorming session's only good"},"1344":{"dur":1,"text":"as the brains in the room."},"1345":{"dur":3,"text":"What type of people do you have on your team?"},"1350":{"dur":4,"text":"- A lot of industrial designers, but mechanical engineers,"},"1355":{"dur":2,"text":"computer science, a lot of technical folks,"},"1357":{"dur":1,"text":"and then the design researchers,"},"1358":{"dur":3,"text":"but we, at IDEO and the d.School, look for"},"1361":{"dur":1,"text":"what we call T-shape people:"},"1363":{"dur":1,"text":"they have a real depth in one area,"},"1365":{"dur":3,"text":"and that might be design, it might be computer science,"},"1368":{"dur":3,"text":"but they're interested in the other disciplines,"},"1372":{"dur":1,"text":"they're really interested in design research."},"1374":{"dur":1,"text":"So they play well."},"1376":{"dur":1,"text":"If you think more of an I-shape person"},"1377":{"dur":2,"text":"that's more of a guru, they only wanna do their stuff,"},"1380":{"dur":2,"text":"and they get kinda grumpy if they're talking"},"1383":{"dur":0,"text":"about other people's stuff."},"1384":{"dur":3,"text":"Gurus can be great, but they're just not a fit"},"1388":{"dur":1,"text":"- Do you invite them in?"},"1390":{"dur":1,"text":"Do you invite in people to participate?"},"1391":{"dur":2,"text":"- We'll interview gurus like crazy, 'cause they're experts"},"1394":{"dur":1,"text":"and they're extreme, so you wanna know"},"1395":{"dur":1,"text":"what they're thinking."},"1397":{"dur":3,"text":"But they're not necessarily right for our culture."},"1400":{"dur":1,"text":"- Does everybody on these teams"},"1402":{"dur":2,"text":"have to be able to build something?"},"1404":{"dur":1,"text":"Do they all have to be able to--"},"1405":{"dur":1,"text":"- In the toy group, they have to be able to build,"},"1407":{"dur":1,"text":"whether it's physical or digital, they have to be able"},"1408":{"dur":2,"text":"to make something tangible."},"1413":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a lot of misconception around ideas"},"1416":{"dur":0,"text":"where it's all in your head"},"1417":{"dur":2,"text":"and then you just have to give it to someone else."},"1419":{"dur":3,"text":"There's a lot of what we call thinking with your hands."},"1422":{"dur":2,"text":"So as you're building, you're designing"},"1425":{"dur":1,"text":"and creating at the same time."},"1427":{"dur":1,"text":"The brain gets way too much credit."},"1428":{"dur":1,"text":"The hands should get just as much credit,"},"1430":{"dur":4,"text":"'cause it's informing your decision and making thing happen"},"1435":{"dur":4,"text":"and discovering things and inventions as you go."},"1440":{"dur":0,"text":"- Super."},"1442":{"dur":3,"text":"How do you manage a group of creative people like this?"},"1446":{"dur":1,"text":"I imagine you get a bunch of folks"},"1448":{"dur":2,"text":"who have lots of independent ideas;"},"1451":{"dur":1,"text":"what type of culture do you create"},"1453":{"dur":2,"text":"and how do you manage that group?"},"1455":{"dur":3,"text":"- I was on a panel once and a similar question came up."},"1458":{"dur":2,"text":"I was on a panel with a Navy SEAL,"},"1461":{"dur":2,"text":"the captain of the America's Cup,"},"1463":{"dur":3,"text":"and the president of Sonos, the founder of Sonos."},"1466":{"dur":2,"text":"And the audience asked me, he said, \"What do you do"},"1469":{"dur":2,"text":"\"from your teams to keep them from burning out?\""},"1472":{"dur":2,"text":"And I looked at the SEAL and I said, (chuckles)"},"1474":{"dur":1,"text":"\"This is the guy that can answer that question.\""},"1476":{"dur":3,"text":"And he said, \"They're burned out when they fall over,\""},"1479":{"dur":0,"text":"so it was just like..."},"1480":{"dur":1,"text":"(audience laughs)"},"1482":{"dur":4,"text":"\"Alright, we don't burn our guys out that much.\""},"1487":{"dur":2,"text":"So, we'll brainstorm, and then we'll look for ideas that,"},"1490":{"dur":4,"text":"we'll do a vote or some editing from the senior folks"},"1495":{"dur":2,"text":"as to what we think has more potential,"},"1497":{"dur":2,"text":"and then we'll look for who's really passionate"},"1499":{"dur":1,"text":"around trying to make that come to life."},"1501":{"dur":1,"text":"And that might be one person pointing,"},"1503":{"dur":3,"text":"if it's a robotics person, we got that person on our team,"},"1506":{"dur":1,"text":"they're gonna be really jazzed about that."},"1507":{"dur":1,"text":"If it's some type of fashion doll"},"1509":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's gotta be beautiful and all this,"},"1512":{"dur":1,"text":"we've got that kind of person."},"1513":{"dur":2,"text":"So we'll have people at different points,"},"1515":{"dur":2,"text":"but other folks, then, will come in and help,"},"1517":{"dur":2,"text":"because they're excited about learning on something."},"1520":{"dur":3,"text":"That's really neat about any organization"},"1524":{"dur":1,"text":"if it's framed up the right way,"},"1525":{"dur":3,"text":"if it's a learning organization, 'cause personally,"},"1529":{"dur":2,"text":"you wanna learn something new, a new skill, a new talent."},"1532":{"dur":3,"text":"We have that sort of mindset around learning."},"1535":{"dur":2,"text":"You think you're in school and once you're out,"},"1537":{"dur":1,"text":"you're done learning."},"1539":{"dur":2,"text":"It should be, you should always have that appetite"},"1541":{"dur":4,"text":"to keep learning, because it's more creatively satisfying."},"1546":{"dur":4,"text":"- So, I know that you're really passionate also about space,"},"1551":{"dur":2,"text":"and how the physical space affects"},"1553":{"dur":3,"text":"the way you think, the way you behave."},"1557":{"dur":3,"text":"Can you describe the space that you guys have designed?"},"1560":{"dur":1,"text":"I know it's gone through lots of iterations,"},"1562":{"dur":1,"text":"so maybe you can share a little bit"},"1563":{"dur":1,"text":"about how the space has been designed"},"1565":{"dur":3,"text":"and how it's changed over time and why?"},"1568":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yeah, space is, for those who almost own companies"},"1570":{"dur":4,"text":"or already do, it's one of the most under-utilized resources"},"1575":{"dur":2,"text":"for innovation, because people just lay it out"},"1577":{"dur":1,"text":"and they don't think about it"},"1579":{"dur":3,"text":"or what looks cool or what's cost-effective."},"1582":{"dur":1,"text":"So it doesn't have to be expensive,"},"1584":{"dur":2,"text":"it just has to help your behavior."},"1587":{"dur":2,"text":"So we have a lot of space in the Toy Lab or at IDEO"},"1589":{"dur":1,"text":"or at the d.School what we call the we space,"},"1591":{"dur":1,"text":"how do we work together better?"},"1592":{"dur":2,"text":"So a lot of project spaces, versus the me space,"},"1595":{"dur":3,"text":"which is my office, I want it quiet, I want a view."},"1598":{"dur":2,"text":"That's not important to us."},"1600":{"dur":2,"text":"All the action for our new folks is not about an office."},"1603":{"dur":1,"text":"In fact, there's almost no offices."},"1605":{"dur":2,"text":"They are about, where's my project space, what are my tools,"},"1608":{"dur":1,"text":"who's on my team?"},"1610":{"dur":4,"text":"So we wanna have tons of interesting project spaces."},"1614":{"dur":4,"text":"We had a team working for Fender Guitar at IDEO,"},"1619":{"dur":4,"text":"and they were worried that the musicians would be too cool,"},"1624":{"dur":2,"text":"so they brainstormed and they thought,"},"1626":{"dur":3,"text":"and they found a old Airstream down in Santa Barbara,"},"1629":{"dur":1,"text":"so they drove down there and got it, brought it up,"},"1631":{"dur":2,"text":"gutted it, and made it into their project space."},"1633":{"dur":1,"text":"That looks really cool now."},"1635":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughing)"},"1637":{"dur":0,"text":"- It fit the bill."},"1638":{"dur":1,"text":"- That fit the bill."},"1639":{"dur":4,"text":"Yeah, so in the Toy Lab, it's definitely a maker's space."},"1644":{"dur":3,"text":"There are these super-cool project Toy Lab benches"},"1647":{"dur":2,"text":"that's got every toy you need there,"},"1650":{"dur":1,"text":"there's a little mini shop there,"},"1651":{"dur":2,"text":"even though the big shop's 200 yards away,"},"1653":{"dur":3,"text":"and then our digital team sits right there in that space"},"1656":{"dur":3,"text":"too, our Design For Play team sits right in that space,"},"1660":{"dur":3,"text":"so it's a lot of action happening there."},"1663":{"dur":3,"text":"- What about prototyping materials, do you have any?"},"1666":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, we have a wall,"},"1669":{"dur":4,"text":"I think I've got $15,000 of Container Store drawers there"},"1674":{"dur":2,"text":"of all different stuff, all labeled

heads (laughs).\n- Oh, that's scary."},"1699":{"dur":3,"text":"- (laughs) I could loan them to you."},"1702":{"dur":0,"text":"So you have all these parts,"},"1703":{"dur":1,"text":"do you use them for inspiration?"},"1705":{"dur":2,"text":"- We use them for tinkering, so you have stuff."},"1707":{"dur":1,"text":"So you can grab something and make something,"},"1709":{"dur":3,"text":"make one of those low-fidelity, rough-and-rapid models."},"1713":{"dur":1,"text":"You don't wanna be wasting a lot of your time"},"1714":{"dur":4,"text":"going out finding stuff when you can collect

a little bit about how you teach this,"},"1726":{"dur":2,"text":"and maybe some folks in the room will get inspired"},"1729":{"dur":1,"text":"to try some of these ideas."},"1731":{"dur":2,"text":"-

please."},"2394":{"dur":2,"text":"- You get all these ideas, how do you capture them,"},"2397":{"dur":2,"text":"how do you store them, how do you manage, basically,"},"2399":{"dur":2,"text":"your
