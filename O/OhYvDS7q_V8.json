automotive."},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a lighter part"},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"and it uses less material waste."},"409":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's overall performance and efficiency"},"412":{"dur":3,"text":"just exceeds standard mass produced products."},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"And then taking this idea"},"417":{"dur":2,"text":"of creating a very detailed structure,"},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"we can apply it to honeycomb structures"},"421":{"dur":3,"text":"and use them within implants."},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"Typically an implant"},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"is more effective within the body"},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"if it's more porous,"},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"because our body tissue will grow into it."},"432":{"dur":3,"text":"There's a lower chance of rejection."},"435":{"dur":3,"text":"But it's very hard to create that in standard ways."},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"With 3D printing,"},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"we're seeing today"},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"that we can create much better implants."},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"And in fact, because we can create"},"446":{"dur":3,"text":"bespoke products en masse, one-offs,"},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"we can create implants"},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"that are specific to individuals."},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"So as you can see,"},"455":{"dur":4,"text":"this technology and the quality of what comes out of the machines is fantastic."},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"And we're starting to see it being used"},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"for final end products."},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"And in fact, as the detail is improving,"},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"the quality is improving,"},"467":{"dur":3,"text":"the price of the machines are falling"},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"and they're becoming quicker."},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"They're also now small

yourself,"},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"which is quite incredible."},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"But then it begs the question,"},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"why don't we all have one in our home?"},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"Because, simply, most of us here today"},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"don't know how to create the data"},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"that a 3D printer

experiences"},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"when I've walked into a store and I've know exactly what I've wanted"},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"and I've searched everywhere for that perfect

interact,"},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"so that you can pass your personal attributes"},"682":{"dur":4,"text":"to the products that you're about to buy."},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"You can today"},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"download a product with software like this,"},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"view the product in 3D."},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the sort of 3D data"},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"that a machine will read."},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"This is a lamp."},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can start iterating the design."},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"You can

soon."},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"What's more likely, and we're seeing it today,"},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"is that data gets sent"},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"to a local manufacturing

electronics were inserted later."},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"It's this lamp, as you can see here."},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"So as long as you have the data,"},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"you can create the

intricately."},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"Using this process,"},"838":{"dur":3,"text":"pioneers in the industry are layering up cells today."},"841":{"dur":3,"text":"So one of the pioneers, for example,
