emerge."},"59":{"dur":3,"text":"Please join me in welcoming Professor Mark Warner."},"62":{"dur":5,"text":"[Applause]."},"70":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, thank you and it's a great pleasure to"},"72":{"dur":1,"text":"be here tonight."},"73":{"dur":3,"text":"I want to relate a story about searches in"},"77":{"dur":3,"text":"Cambridge and in other places for new states of matter"},"81":{"dur":3,"text":"and by new, I mean new according to an ancient"},"84":{"dur":3,"text":"classification that goes back to the hero of"},"87":{"dur":2,"text":"this evening, Robert Hooke, who has been called"},"90":{"dur":1,"text":"England's Leonardo."},"92":{"dur":2,"text":"I will say a bit about him as we go along."},"94":{"dur":2,"text":"But to get started, we'll have to talk about liquids,"},"97":{"dur":2,"text":"solids and gases and then I\u2019ll talk about some"},"99":{"dur":3,"text":"curious substances and then about breaking the"},"103":{"dur":2,"text":"rules that Hooke laid down so clearly a long"},"106":{"dur":2,"text":"time ago, and where is it leading?"},"109":{"dur":2,"text":"I'd like to say at the outset that most of this work,"},"111":{"dur":2,"text":"the theory and the experiment that you will see"},"114":{"dur":2,"text":"has been done with a fabulous, very able"},"117":{"dur":2,"text":"colleague of mine in Cambridge, Professor"},"119":{"dur":2,"text":"Terentjev, and I\u2019m actually delighted to see in"},"121":{"dur":1,"text":"the audience another colleague of mine,"},"123":{"dur":1,"text":"James Adams."},"125":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's a great pleasure to be able to present\ntheir work."},"129":{"dur":1,"text":"So here is our hero."},"130":{"dur":2,"text":"This is Robert Hooke, or at least a person whom"},"133":{"dur":2,"text":"we think is Robert Hooke."},"136":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's on the cover of a wonderful book by"},"138":{"dur":4,"text":"Lisa Jardine about Hooke, and as I read more about"},"142":{"dur":3,"text":"him, he becomes more and more a hero of mine"},"146":{"dur":3,"text":"for reasons that I think you will begin to see."},"150":{"dur":3,"text":"And also, there is a book by Allan Chapman"},"153":{"dur":3,"text":"called England's Leonardo and that\u2019s an essay"},"156":{"dur":3,"text":"that you can find on the web, based on his book."},"159":{"dur":3,"text":"Both are most compelling reading."},"162":{"dur":6,"text":"So Hooke, he was born in 1635 on the Isle of Wight."},"168":{"dur":3,"text":"His father was a clergyman and he went eventually"},"172":{"dur":3,"text":"to school in London and then to Oxford, and he"},"176":{"dur":3,"text":"worked in Oxford after his studies as an operator"},"180":{"dur":0,"text":"for Boyle."},"181":{"dur":1,"text":"It was somebody who helped Boyle with his"},"183":{"dur":3,"text":"experiments on vacuum and on air, and the"},"186":{"dur":2,"text":"fundamentals of nature that they were beginning"},"189":{"dur":4,"text":"to unpick at that time as the Enlightenment\nwas starting."},"193":{"dur":2,"text":"And Hooke and Boyle were very much at the"},"196":{"dur":5,"text":"forefront of overthrowing 2000 years of"},"201":{"dur":3,"text":"Aristotelian understanding about the world,"},"204":{"dur":2,"text":"principally by experiment."},"207":{"dur":2,"text":"And he had a vision of matter that was atomic,"},"210":{"dur":3,"text":"kinematic; it involved movement, pressure and energy."},"214":{"dur":2,"text":"And oddly enough, that's a story we'll come to"},"216":{"dur":1,"text":"for most of the evening."},"218":{"dur":2,"text":"So Hooke is really here in spirit."},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"He was curator of the experiments for the"},"223":{"dur":2,"text":"Royal Society from 1662, and he became a"},"226":{"dur":6,"text":"Professor in Gresham College and in 1665"},"233":{"dur":2,"text":"became a Fellow of the Royal Society and he really"},"235":{"dur":2,"text":"played a central part in the birth of the"},"237":{"dur":2,"text":"Enlightenment and the modern scientific world too."},"240":{"dur":2,"text":"He really is a heroic figure."},"243":{"dur":3,"text":"And in a sense, it's quite apposite to talk about him"},"246":{"dur":3,"text":"and completing his classification in some sense"},"250":{"dur":4,"text":"in the Royal Society, he was one of the founding"},"254":{"dur":2,"text":"figures in the early science there."},"257":{"dur":4,"text":"So why return to what Hooke was preoccupied with?"},"261":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, I think we offer a small sort of completion of"},"264":{"dur":4,"text":"Hooke's vision of solids, liquids and gases and so"},"268":{"dur":3,"text":"it\u2019s good to understand that and in finding some"},"272":{"dur":3,"text":"things that slide between Hooke's rules, we can"},"276":{"dur":1,"text":"look for new sorts of mechanics and new kinds"},"278":{"dur":1,"text":"of materials."},"279":{"dur":4,"text":"So it is, I think, apposite to return to these."},"283":{"dur":5,"text":"So let me lay out what the understanding would\nbe from Hooke."},"289":{"dur":3,"text":"There are two properties which define matter in"},"293":{"dur":1,"text":"the Hookean sense."},"294":{"dur":1,"text":"They are volume and shape."},"296":{"dur":4,"text":"So if we take a gas, it takes the shape and the"},"300":{"dur":3,"text":"volume of its container, for instance, this room."},"304":{"dur":3,"text":"And it costs only a very little bit of energy to"},"308":{"dur":1,"text":"change the volume."},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"You work against the pressure but it's relatively"},"312":{"dur":2,"text":"small value, and we'll return to that."},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"And it obeys the celebrated Perfect Gas Law,"},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"part of which bears Boyle's name from the"},"320":{"dur":3,"text":"experiments that were done with Hooke."},"324":{"dur":3,"text":"And then if we add one property, the volume;"},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"volume is just a number: metres cubed or whatever,"},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"then we find we have liquids, and liquids have"},"333":{"dur":2,"text":"a well defined volume."},"335":{"dur":1,"text":"By that, I mean if you want to change the volume"},"336":{"dur":3,"text":"of a liquid, you have to press on it but a liquid"},"340":{"dur":3,"text":"will assume the shape of its container."},"344":{"dur":2,"text":"In other words, it doesn\u2019t have its own shape."},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"As I move this bottle around, you'll see the shape"},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"of the liquid changes with no problem,"},"351":{"dur":1,"text":"but if I want to change its volume, I have to"},"353":{"dur":2,"text":"work on it quite hard."},"356":{"dur":4,"text":"And then I can take both properties: shape and volume"},"360":{"dur":1,"text":"and then I have a solid."},"362":{"dur":1,"text":"So a solid has got a volume and it requires some"},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"work to change it, but it's also got a shape"},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"which takes some work to change."},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"And Hooke as well as working on gases,"},"371":{"dur":4,"text":"he really formulated the beginnings of elasticity,"},"375":{"dur":4,"text":"saying that the force that a body will exert,"},"379":{"dur":3,"text":"or you exert on a body depends on the extension"},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"X, and the connection is what we call the"},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"Spring constant today and this is basically"},"387":{"dur":1,"text":"Hooke's law."},"389":{"dur":3,"text":"And so it underpins all of elasticity and in a sense,"},"393":{"dur":3,"text":"it sort of draws all of this understanding of"},"396":{"dur":1,"text":"matter together."},"398":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is the Hookean classification."},"401":{"dur":3,"text":"There are two properties: volume and shape"},"404":{"dur":2,"text":"and if you have two properties, here is the border"},"406":{"dur":4,"text":"and here is the border - you have three phases\npossible."},"410":{"dur":1,"text":"So what I want to investigate tonight is,"},"412":{"dur":4,"text":"is there only three phases in the Hookean sense?"},"417":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, there are some things you might call a misfit,"},"420":{"dur":1,"text":"like rubber."},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"Rubber is very soft."},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"It's very extensible and we'll talk quite a lot"},"426":{"dur":3,"text":"about it, but I think Hooke would say that it's a solid."},"430":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not flowing out of my hand."},"431":{"dur":5,"text":"It's a perfectly respectable solid, at least at\nfirst glance."},"437":{"dur":1,"text":"And then there are materials which are called"},"439":{"dur":4,"text":"liquid crystals and they too are rather bizarre."},"443":{"dur":1,"text":"Here is a liquid crystal."},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"It\u2019s in a bottle because it really is a liquid,"},"448":{"dur":1,"text":"and if I took the top off the bottle, I could"},"449":{"dur":4,"text":"pour it out, so it's what Hooke would call a liquid"},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"but it does have this mysterious word 'crystal'"},"455":{"dur":3,"text":"in its name and that\u2019s because it's ordered"},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"in some way."},"460":{"dur":3,"text":"And so it sort of smacks of crystal, but really in the"},"464":{"dur":3,"text":"narrowest Hookean sense, that is a liquid."},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"So, and I want to remain in the narrowest"},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"Hookean sense."},"471":{"dur":3,"text":"There is a plasma which is a sort of gas of charges"},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"which is stiff in getting the charges back and forth,"},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"but it really is a gas and plasma will flow into"},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"a volume and so it's a gas."},"483":{"dur":4,"text":"And a glass is disordered in some modern sense"},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"which we understand if we understand atoms,"},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"but this really is a solid and..."},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"[Chimes on glass]"},"495":{"dur":3,"text":"It rings in exactly the way that Hooke investigated"},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"the ringing of solids 350 years ago."},"502":{"dur":1,"text":"This is a solid."},"504":{"dur":3,"text":"So having disposed of these misfits, let me now"},"507":{"dur":4,"text":"turn to these misfits again and say a bit about them."},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"So one of the things I want to talk about is"},"515":{"dur":6,"text":"classical rubber, and rubber is a solid,\nas you have seen."},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"It derives originally at least, from the latex that"},"524":{"dur":4,"text":"is the sap of a rubber tree and it's a liquid."},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"If we cook the..."},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, the liquid is composed of long chain molecules,"},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"which are called polymers so they're just lots of"},"536":{"dur":4,"text":"little units linked together to form a long molecule."},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"If we bake it up with rubber which forms these"},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"links between the chains (that's these green things),"},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"that's called vulcanisation."},"548":{"dur":3,"text":"We turn the liquid into a solid."},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"But it's a strange sort of solid."},"553":{"dur":4,"text":"If we take a block of it and extend it, if that\u2019s 1cm"},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"or 1m, and we extend it by a factor of lambda"},"560":{"dur":4,"text":"then the chains inside, they don't flow but they do"},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"distort and they are like a liquid."},"567":{"dur":4,"text":"They have rapid motion, these molecules but"},"572":{"dur":3,"text":"it is a respectable solid and reacts against"},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"that by wanting to retract."},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"If we look at the shape of these molecules,"},"581":{"dur":3,"text":"on average they are isotropic, they're spherical."},"585":{"dur":6,"text":"That's the maximum disorder a system like this\ncan adopt."},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"We say that it's got maximum entropy, a measure of"},"594":{"dur":3,"text":"the disorder, and so it's rapidly moving around"},"597":{"dur":4,"text":"but on average, its shape is spherical."},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"And if we stretch the rubber out, the molecules"},"604":{"dur":4,"text":"then elongate and the elongated molecules"},"611":{"dur":4,"text":"the elongated molecules are in a low state of disorder."},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"They have low entropy."},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"Entropy and disorder is essentially heat,"},"619":{"dur":3,"text":"as Hooke was well aware, and the heat is"},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"released as we stretch this."},"626":{"dur":1,"text":"Nature resists that."},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"Nature prefers states to be a state of maximum"},"630":{"dur":3,"text":"entropy, maximum disorder and so the rubber tries"},"633":{"dur":4,"text":"to retract in order to recover its random state."},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"So forces are needed to extend a piece of rubber."},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"They obey Hooke's law."},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"They are Hookean solids."},"645":{"dur":3,"text":"So rubber molecules are in rapid liquid-like motion."},"649":{"dur":4,"text":"That means that a rubber is extensible like a liquid;"},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"its molecules are in rapid motion which means that"},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"we don't have to wait for it to creep to extend."},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"We can just stretch it."},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's got roughly speaking, the strength of"},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"human muscle, and that\u2019s quite important."},"665":{"dur":1,"text":"We'll come back to that."},"667":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, the motto of the Royal Society is\nNullius in Verba."},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"Which means don't take one's word for it;"},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"do it, demonstrate it, do experiments."},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"And this motto goes back to the 1660s,"},"680":{"dur":3,"text":"and Hooke was in charge of experiments for the\nSociety."},"683":{"dur":3,"text":"It was this idea that you didn't think about it"},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"purely in the Aristotelian way, about nature,"},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"but you actually put it to the test."},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"It was the great advance that led to the\nmodern science."},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"So where I demonstrate during this lecture,"},"698":{"dur":3,"text":"the cue for the demonstration are these words."},"702":{"dur":4,"text":"And I\u2019m going to ask my assistant to actually"},"706":{"dur":4,"text":"stretch the piece of rubber with me and if you"},"711":{"dur":1,"text":"walk down, we can stretch this piece of rubber."},"713":{"dur":4,"text":"It's about 2m long and rubber is a most remarkable\nsolid."},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"Have you ever seen a solid that just extends"},"720":{"dur":2,"text":"and extends, and extends."},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact, this room is not long enough."},"725":{"dur":4,"text":"If you keep walking and..."},"730":{"dur":1,"text":"Assistants are always a bit afraid of stretching"},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"too much because they think it will break,"},"734":{"dur":1,"text":"but it shouldn\u2019t break and you could even"},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"creep back still further."},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"So the lessons to learn from this:"},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"firstly, this is extremely extensible."},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"It easily stretches by 1000%."},"745":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's not like a normal solid."},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"It really is a liquid."},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"The second thing is that we didn't have to stretch"},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"it slowly so it won\u2019t break; we could go at"},"755":{"dur":2,"text":"10m a second and it still would have stretched."},"758":{"dur":3,"text":"And that\u2019s fine, and clearly its specific strength"},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"is about that of human muscle, otherwise we"},"763":{"dur":1,"text":"couldn't stretch that."},"765":{"dur":5,"text":"The muscles in my arm are about the thickness"},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"of this rubber."},"771":{"dur":1,"text":"And if we let it go..."},"772":{"dur":1,"text":"[Bang]."},"774":{"dur":3,"text":"We see that it comes back with amazing speed."},"777":{"dur":0,"text":"It didn't hit you, I\u2019m sure?"},"778":{"dur":1,"text":"No."},"780":{"dur":5,"text":"So the moral in that is not just a big bang."},"785":{"dur":4,"text":"The moral is it actually can move back as\nfast as you like."},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"The molecular processes are really rapid."},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"It only goes at 10m per second because it's not"},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"very strong, but it is quite dense, like water."},"798":{"dur":1,"text":"So that\u2019s what governs that."},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, the other thing is this is very cold."},"802":{"dur":3,"text":"If you put it to your lips, you can feel that it's cold"},"806":{"dur":3,"text":"and that means that it's pumping heat in and out,"},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"just as we promised."},"811":{"dur":5,"text":"So we have demonstrated that, and as Liam,"},"817":{"dur":3,"text":"our audiovisual person remembers from school,"},"820":{"dur":1,"text":"this was an experiment you could do at school."},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"You stretch a piece of rubber, wave it around"},"824":{"dur":2,"text":"so it lets its heat out and then put it back quickly"},"827":{"dur":2,"text":"and you will feel if you put it against your lips,"},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"that it's cold, very cold."},"831":{"dur":2,"text":"So afterwards, I\u2019ll hand some of these out to"},"833":{"dur":2,"text":"people not fortunate enough to have tried that"},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"and you can do it for yourselves."},"839":{"dur":6,"text":"Okay, so that is the first of our Nullius en Verba\ntonight."},"845":{"dur":2,"text":"So let me summarise that."},"848":{"dur":2,"text":"We have a block of rubber."},"850":{"dur":4,"text":"It's got chains with a spherical\nisotropic distribution."},"855":{"dur":3,"text":"We stretch it; the distribution, so we extend the"},"858":{"dur":2,"text":"body and we elongate the chains."},"861":{"dur":3,"text":"So the chains are elongated, they lower their"},"864":{"dur":3,"text":"entropy, heat is released like a heat pump as"},"867":{"dur":5,"text":"you'll see afterwards, and so this is what\ndrives rubber."},"873":{"dur":4,"text":"The molecular shape mirrors the macroscopic shape."},"877":{"dur":1,"text":"So remember that because we will return to that"},"879":{"dur":2,"text":"time and time again."},"881":{"dur":2,"text":"And the modulus of a piece of rubber is about"},"883":{"dur":1,"text":"10 to the 5 Pascales."},"885":{"dur":2,"text":"That happens to be one atmosphere, and the"},"888":{"dur":2,"text":"modulus of a rubber is just this."},"891":{"dur":2,"text":"And for those of you who remembered the last"},"893":{"dur":3,"text":"formula, this looks a lot like the perfect gas law."},"897":{"dur":1,"text":"For the very good reason that it is practically"},"898":{"dur":2,"text":"the gas law; it's all to do with entropy, like in a"},"901":{"dur":4,"text":"gas, but against shape change rather than\nvolume change."},"906":{"dur":4,"text":"So I hope I\u2019ve convinced you that although rubber"},"910":{"dur":4,"text":"is ostensibly a solid, it behaves like a liquid and"},"914":{"dur":2,"text":"in fact, in some senses it's a gas."},"917":{"dur":3,"text":"So I hope I\u2019ll leave you completely confused about\nrubber."},"920":{"dur":1,"text":"Very good."},"922":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, let me introduce another oddball,"},"926":{"dur":2,"text":"another misfit and that's the liquid crystal."},"929":{"dur":2,"text":"So liquid crystals were discovered about 100 years ago"},"931":{"dur":3,"text":"and they were curiosities."},"934":{"dur":1,"text":"They are very rich phenomena, for instance,"},"936":{"dur":3,"text":"they respond to electric and magnetic fields"},"940":{"dur":3,"text":"but they were of no use at all, until about 1970"},"943":{"dur":3,"text":"when it became clear they could be used as displays."},"947":{"dur":1,"text":"And they are at the heart of probably one of"},"949":{"dur":1,"text":"the largest industries in the world,"},"951":{"dur":2,"text":"three billion displays a year are made from"},"953":{"dur":1,"text":"liquid crystals."},"955":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's because these are anisotropic liquids."},"960":{"dur":1,"text":"They are liquids and they flow."},"961":{"dur":3,"text":"I showed you a bottle of it here, and they"},"964":{"dur":2,"text":"respond to electric magnetic fields."},"967":{"dur":2,"text":"That\u2019s what makes them a display in a watch,"},"969":{"dur":3,"text":"and they have thread-like defects in their ordering."},"973":{"dur":2,"text":"That gives them their name, from the Greek word,"},"975":{"dur":4,"text":"'nematic' for thread."},"980":{"dur":1,"text":"So when I talk about nematics, I just mean the"},"981":{"dur":3,"text":"simplest form of a liquid crystal."},"986":{"dur":4,"text":"So a liquid crystal, it's made of rod-like molecules,"},"991":{"dur":1,"text":"so the little rods."},"992":{"dur":2,"text":"Here is a computer simulation where the rod-like"},"994":{"dur":5,"text":"elements are like lozenges."},"1000":{"dur":2,"text":"Here is a molecule that's stiff in the middle and"},"1003":{"dur":2,"text":"has got some junk at the end so it doesn't\ncrystallise,"},"1005":{"dur":3,"text":"so it remains a fluid for a long time."},"1009":{"dur":2,"text":"And at high temperatures, it's just an ordinary"},"1011":{"dur":4,"text":"isotropic fluid and at low temperatures,"},"1015":{"dur":2,"text":"when you cool it down it's ordered."},"1017":{"dur":4,"text":"So the lozenges, the little sticks are on average,"},"1022":{"dur":3,"text":"ordered about a direction called the director."},"1026":{"dur":1,"text":"So these are remarkable fluids."},"1028":{"dur":4,"text":"They actually go from one phase to another as"},"1032":{"dur":2,"text":"you heat and cool them."},"1034":{"dur":4,"text":"So in the spirit of this, I shall demonstrate here"},"1039":{"dur":2,"text":"a bottle of liquid crystal."},"1042":{"dur":6,"text":"I'm heating it with a hairdryer and what you will"},"1048":{"dur":4,"text":"see is that fairly soon it will start going clear,"},"1053":{"dur":3,"text":"which is a hallmark of the isotropic phase."},"1056":{"dur":5,"text":"And you can see at the top it's gradually"},"1061":{"dur":7,"text":"clarifying and now you can see it's gone clear."},"1069":{"dur":1,"text":"There's a little bit of cold stuff in the middle,"},"1071":{"dur":4,"text":"and now it's finally gone, and if I dip it in this"},"1076":{"dur":3,"text":"water, it will speed up its cooling and we will"},"1079":{"dur":4,"text":"see that it goes back to the cool state."},"1084":{"dur":1,"text":"You see it's gradually going cloudy which is"},"1085":{"dur":3,"text":"this ordered anisotropic state that scatters light"},"1089":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's how it works as a..."},"1092":{"dur":2,"text":"Can you see that?"},"1094":{"dur":2,"text":"That's how it works in a display."},"1096":{"dur":2,"text":"Let me try and speed up its return."},"1099":{"dur":1,"text":"There we go."},"1100":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's

this"},"1677":{"dur":2,"text":"Hookean classification?"},"1680":{"dur":2,"text":"So I would like to show you this now."},"1682":{"dur":2,"text":"You remember that solids have got both shape"},"1684":{"dur":3,"text":"and volume, whereas liquids have just got volume."},"1688":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, volume is half a litre; it's just a number."},"1692":{"dur":1,"text":"There is no

of this story, let me press to the punch line"},"1702":{"dur":3,"text":"is when something goes from liquid to solid, we"},"1706":{"dur":2,"text":"normally think of it just freezing and that's it."},"1709":{"dur":2,"text":"But if it's something rather subtle with five"},"1712":{"dur":2,"text":"numbers defining its shape then it's possible"},"1715":{"dur":3,"text":"that actually, some of it freezes; some of these"},"1718":{"dur":3,"text":"numbers freeze immediately and others don't."},"1722":{"dur":1,"text":"So we can have something that is both a liquid"},"1724":{"dur":2,"text":"and a solid at the same time."},"1726":{"dur":3,"text":"So let me try and now demonstrate this."},"1730":{"dur":2,"text":"So we take a cube, so I\u2019ve brought along a"},"1732":{"dur":2,"text":"cardboard cube."},"1734":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's got three directions associated with it:"},"1738":{"dur":5,"text":"an X axis, a Y axis and a Z axis."},"1744":{"dur":2,"text":"So there are three axes that

stretch this this way and this way,"},"1758":{"dur":3,"text":"well, each of those is if you like, a shape change."},"1762":{"dur":3,"text":"But if I stretched it the third way as well,"},"1766":{"dur":2,"text":"then its volume would change."},"1768":{"dur":1,"text":"But we've already counted volume."},"1770":{"dur":2,"text":"That was one number which was for a liquid,"},"1772":{"dur":5,"text":"so of these three extensions, I must only count two."},"1777":{"dur":2,"text":"So those are two of our numbers."},"1780":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, the other thing you can do with a solid"},"1783":{"dur":2,"text":"is you can shear it, and by shear, I mean I do"},"1786":{"dur":1,"text":"this to it."},"1787":{"dur":2,"text":"The top face and the bottom face move

down."},"1799":{"dur":2,"text":"So there are two numbers, if you like,"},"1801":{"dur":2,"text":"associated with the shear, but let me examine"},"1804":{"dur":1,"text":"this more carefully."},"1805":{"dur":2,"text":"This is what is called a simple shear and if I do"},"1808":{"dur":2,"text":"a simple shear this way and then a simple shear"},"1810":{"dur":3,"text":"that way, I end up with something that looks\nlike a diamond."},"1814":{"dur":2,"text":"Can you all see the diamond?"},"1817":{"dur":3,"text":"That\u2019s fine: that's called a pure shear and that is"},"1820":{"dur":1,"text":"a distortion of the body."},"1822":{"dur":1,"text":"But let me do it another way."},"1823":{"dur":3,"text":"I can go like this and then I can go like that."},"1827":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm shearing downwards, and now you see something"},"1830":{"dur":2,"text":"that is again, a square."},"1833":{"dur":3,"text":"And so all I\u2019ve done is rotate it like that."},"1837":{"dur":1,"text":"And that\u2019s not elasticity."},"1838":{"dur":2,"text":"That\u2019s not what Hooke would say is the distortion"},"1841":{"dur":1,"text":"of a body."},"1842":{"dur":4,"text":"If I take any body and if I just rotate it then I"},"1847":{"dur":1,"text":"haven't distorted it."},"1848":{"dur":2,"text":"The force doesn't vary like the extension,"},"1851":{"dur":1,"text":"as we have in Hooke's law."},"1852":{"dur":2,"text":"It's just the same as it was before."},"1854":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's just a rotation."},"1856":{"dur":3,"text":"So it says that for each of these, about each axis,"},"1860":{"dur":2,"text":"this is one of them, we have shears but I\u2019d"},"1862":{"dur":2,"text":"better only count one number: the one that turns"},"1865":{"dur":2,"text":"it into a diamond."},"1867":{"dur":2,"text":"So we can see that on the screen now."},"1869":{"dur":3,"text":"There's simple shears added to produce a diamond"},"1873":{"dur":1,"text":"which is a pure shear."},"1874":{"dur":2,"text":"That's one number, and this is not one number -"},"1877":{"dur":3,"text":"it's a shear with a negative up and down shear,"},"1881":{"dur":1,"text":"and it gives me a rotation."},"1882":{"dur":2,"text":"So I must count one number for each of those"},"1885":{"dur":2,"text":"and there are three different axes, so there are"},"1887":{"dur":4,"text":"three numbers and two plus three is five."},"1891":{"dur":2,"text":"Those are the five numbers that define shape."},"1894":{"dur":5,"text":"So shape is not a simple quantity and that is\nthe let out."},"1900":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, there is the demonstration and I have"},"1901":{"dur":2,"text":"already done it, so you've seen this one."},"1904":{"dur":4,"text":"That's in the spirit of the Royal Society."},"1910":{"dur":1,"text":"So soft deformations."},"1911":{"dur":2,"text":"I now want to look to see if I can deform

the distribution of chains can simply rotate"},"1977":{"dur":2,"text":"and this continues until the pull this way is"},"1979":{"dur":2,"text":"complete, and all of these guys on

chains is unchanged."},"2011":{"dur":3,"text":"The liquid crystal order is unchanged,"},"2014":{"dur":1,"text":"so nothing has happened."},"2016":{"dur":3,"text":"So it doesn\u2019t cost me any energy to go along here"},"2020":{"dur":3,"text":"but the thing has changed shape."},"2023":{"dur":2,"text":"So I\u2019ve actually taken something that's like a solid."},"2026":{"dur":2,"text":"I\u2019ve

much"},"2319":{"dur":3,"text":"elongated and on the hot side, the force is high"},"2323":{"dur":2,"text":"and it naturally wants to contract."},"2326":{"dur":1,"text":"So we have more force on this
