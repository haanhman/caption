Now on the face of it, the position in"},"676":{"dur":4,"text":"international law is straightforward as\nthe English Court decided in the Miguel"},"680":{"dur":5,"text":"case. A head of state, a sovereign, remains\na sovereign even when they travel outside"},"685":{"dur":5,"text":"their own territory. And therefore they\nretain their powers as sovereign. They"},"691":{"dur":4,"text":"retain the privileges that they possess,\nand they are immune from local"},"695":{"dur":6,"text":"jurisdiction. It all looks very simple. In\ninternational law it is never that"},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"simple as it looks."},"704":{"dur":5,"text":"One of the reasons for that is that\nthere is no written text, no treaty"},"710":{"dur":6,"text":"dealing with the immunities and\nposition of a visiting head of state.
