people,"},"2238":{"dur":2,"text":"who received support from others, and"},"2240":{"dur":4,"text":"who had the chance themselves to support\nother people, which is interesting."},"2244":{"dur":3,"text":"So remember, generosity is one\nof the paths to happiness, and"},"2248":{"dur":1,"text":"it's also a path to purpose and\nmeaning in

have\nan opportunity to help other people."},"2257":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's the sort of perhaps ironic,\nsurprising take away from research on"},"2262":{"dur":3,"text":"the pursuit of meaning,\nis that when you do acts of service for"},"2265":{"dur":4,"text":"other people, you can benefit yourself\nin this kind of fundamental way."},"2269":{"dur":3,"text":"And so it's through mutual

this disaster."},"2282":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay, so\nlet's revisit some of the themes here, so,"},"2286":{"dur":3,"text":"how are people finding meaning?"},"2290":{"dur":3,"text":"One way is through generosity,\nbeing kind to other people."},"2293":{"dur":2,"text":"Another way is through relationships,\ndeveloping and"},"2296":{"dur":2,"text":"maintaining these relationships."},"2299":{"dur":5,"text":"Another is humility,\nappreciation, self transcendence."},"2304":{"dur":2,"text":"Also connection to other people,"},"2307":{"dur":4,"text":"maintaining the sort of web of\nconnections, maintaining community,"},"2311":{"dur":4,"text":"finding solidarity with other people,\nand then self transcendence."},"2315":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's return to our\nmotivating question of,"},"2318":{"dur":3,"text":"finding meaning in an unjust world,\nhow do we do it?"},"2321":{"dur":4,"text":"And I would say when we see\nthat these factors can lead you"},"2326":{"dur":5,"text":"to a meaningful life, you start to\nsee a way out of that tension, right?"},"2331":{"dur":4,"text":"You start to see that the tension\ndoesn't seem so large."},"2336":{"dur":5,"text":"Perhaps ironically,\nresearch on the science of meaning and"},"2341":{"dur":4,"text":"happiness and satisfaction\nsuggests that you can find meaning"},"2345":{"dur":4,"text":"by trying to make the world\nless unjust for other people."},"2349":{"dur":3,"text":"So by dedicating yourself to\nactivities that would reduce injustice,"},"2353":{"dur":1,"text":"reduce the extent to which\nthe world is unjust."},"2355":{"dur":2,"text":"You might find meaning along the way."},"2357":{"dur":4,"text":"And so something that maybe seemed\nlike a paradox, is not such a paradox."},"2361":{"dur":4,"text":"It's not so much the case that there's\nthis tension between finding meaning for"},"2365":{"dur":3,"text":"yourself and doing service for\nother people."},"2368":{"dur":4,"text":"Instead, by doing service for other\npeople, you can find meaning in yourself."},"2373":{"dur":4,"text":"By orienting ourselves to

for ourselves."},"2384":{"dur":4,"text":"So maybe that tension was the whole time,\nan illusion, and"},"2389":{"dur":6,"text":"we need to turn to one another, and invest\nin one another, and escape the self."},"2396":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay, so you might think that we're done,\nbut we're not quite done."},"2400":{"dur":3,"text":"We're not quite done,\nit's not quite the end."},"2403":{"dur":0,"text":"So."},"2404":{"dur":4,"text":"Let me talk about just a couple other\ninsights on the pursuit of meaning, and"},"2408":{"dur":1,"text":"a couple places we can find it."},"2410":{"dur":3,"text":"So one, there's a very interesting recent\nstudy that was done in the journal"},"2413":{"dur":3,"text":"Psychological Science where they\ndid a cross national comparison of"},"2417":{"dur":2,"text":"what nations' citizens\ntend to find happiness."},"2419":{"dur":4,"text":"And one of the things that they find\nis that citizens of poorer nations"},"2424":{"dur":4,"text":"actually tend to find\nmore meaning in life."},"2428":{"dur":3,"text":"They actually have, they're a little bit\nless happy, but they find more meaning."},"2431":{"dur":3,"text":"They are less satisfied and\nhappy, more meaningful lives."},"2434":{"dur":3,"text":"And so they immediately jumped, and\nit's like why why the heck would that be?"},"2438":{"dur":5,"text":"And one of the things they find is that\npoorer nations tend to be more religious."},"2443":{"dur":2,"text":"And this isn't the only thing\nthat explains this link, but"},"2445":{"dur":0,"text":"it's one of the things."},"2446":{"dur":3,"text":"This partially accounts for\nthis relationship between poor or"},"2450":{"dur":1,"text":"less developed nations have more meaning,"},"2451":{"dur":2,"text":"their citizens reporting on\naverage more meaningful lives."},"2454":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's interesting."},"2455":{"dur":1,"text":"Second thing, I would be remiss for"},"2457":{"dur":2,"text":"talking this long about the pursuit of\nmeaning in life without talking about"},"2460":{"dur":3,"text":"Victor Frankel's great piece,\nMan's Search for Meaning."},"2463":{"dur":1,"text":"Which some of you may have read, and"},"2465":{"dur":1,"text":"if you haven't,\nI think you would really enjoy it."},"2466":{"dur":5,"text":"It's a terrific piece, a terrific short\nbook in which Frankel documents his"},"2472":{"dur":5,"text":"time at Auschwitz and how it was that the\npursuit of meaning, finding a basis for"},"2477":{"dur":4,"text":"meaning, wound up helping people\nphysically survive the Nazi Holocaust."},"2481":{"dur":4,"text":"And Frankel tells us that\nthose people that surrounded"},"2486":{"dur":3,"text":"him during the Holocaust in Auschwitz who\nsurvived were those people who were able"},"2490":{"dur":3,"text":"to find some source of meaning or\npurpose for their lives."},"2493":{"dur":1,"text":"And for\na lot of people this was about family."},"2495":{"dur":1,"text":"For a lot of people\nthis was about a cause."},"2497":{"dur":2,"text":"There's this famous aphorism\nwhere he talks about"},"2499":{"dur":1,"text":"being on this terrible\nmarch with all these men."},"2501":{"dur":3,"text":"And one of them shouts out,\nwhat if our wives could see us now,"},"2505":{"dur":3,"text":"I hope they're doing better than us,\nlet's think of them."},"2508":{"dur":3,"text":"And then they walk on thinking of\ntheir wives in a better place for"},"2512":{"dur":5,"text":"pulling up that familial connection, and\nthat memory that gave their lives meaning."},"2517":{"dur":1,"text":"But also doing better,"},"2519":{"dur":3,"text":"because they knew every other one\nwas thinking of the same thing."},"2522":{"dur":2,"text":"And that connection buttressed them and"},"2525":{"dur":4,"text":"helped them survive this\nterrible trudge through the cold."},"2529":{"dur":3,"text":"But another thing Frankel\ntalks about again is faith,"},"2532":{"dur":4,"text":"that faith helped get people through."},"2537":{"dur":4,"text":"So we might think that that means\nthese pieces of research mean religion"},"2541":{"dur":0,"text":"is the answer."},"2542":{"dur":2,"text":"You wanna find meaning in life,"},"2545":{"dur":2,"text":"you wanna find purpose in life,\nreligion's the answer."},"2547":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's not wrong."},"2549":{"dur":1,"text":"That's not wrong at all."},"2550":{"dur":1,"text":"That is, for a lot of people,\nexactly the answer."},"2553":{"dur":1,"text":"But what if you're secular?"},"2555":{"dur":2,"text":"What if you're not a religious person?"},"2557":{"dur":3,"text":"What about us Atheists and Agnostics?"},"2561":{"dur":4,"text":"How can we know what it is about religion\nthat helps solve this problem for people,"},"2566":{"dur":1,"text":"that provides meaning for people."},"2567":{"dur":3,"text":"How can we get on the bus too?"},"2570":{"dur":3,"text":"And really when you break down the\nfeatures of religion, you see a bunch of,"},"2574":{"dur":4,"text":"of organized religion, you see it's almost\nlike a list of paths to meaning and life."},"2579":{"dur":1,"text":"It's really interesting, actually."},"2581":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think you get a deeper\ninsight on the functions,"},"2583":{"dur":2,"text":"the social functions of\nreligion from doing that."},"2586":{"dur":5,"text":"And so,\nwe look at what it is about religion that"},"2591":{"dur":4,"text":"overlaps with the factors that lead to\nthe realization of a meaningful life."},"2596":{"dur":3,"text":"You see a lot of the same themes we've\nbeen talking about in a secular sense up"},"2599":{"dur":0,"text":"til now, right?"},"2600":{"dur":5,"text":"Generosity, morality, service,\nalso all this community stuff, right?"},"2605":{"dur":2,"text":"Solidarity, collectivism, community,"},"2608":{"dur":3,"text":"family, religions,\nall religions emphasize these things."},"2612":{"dur":4,"text":"But another thing that you see with\nreligion that we haven't talked about"},"2616":{"dur":3,"text":"at all from a secular\nperspective is immortality."},"2620":{"dur":3,"text":"That's another thing that religions offer,\nalmost all religions,"},"2624":{"dur":6,"text":"all religions I'm aware of, offer some\nform of immortality, which brings with it"},"2630":{"dur":5,"text":"freedom from, liberation from,\nthe fear of mortality, right?"},"2635":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's something that\nwe haven't talked about."},"2638":{"dur":6,"text":"So, we've talked about how, with religion\nor without, you can be generous, right."},"2645":{"dur":1,"text":"You can behave in a moral fashion."},"2646":{"dur":3,"text":"You can dedicate your life to acts\nof service towards other people."},"2649":{"dur":1,"text":"You can invest in your networks and\nothers."},"2651":{"dur":4,"text":"You can lose yourself in groups, you can\nfind solidarity and connect with others."},"2656":{"dur":2,"text":"We talked about how you can do that\nin a religious form if you wanted,"},"2658":{"dur":2,"text":"a spiritual form, or\na totally secular form."},"2661":{"dur":3,"text":"We haven't talked about how maybe\nyou could achieve immortality"},"2664":{"dur":0,"text":"without religion."},"2665":{"dur":4,"text":"And so this last part of my talk,\nwe'll talk about that."},"2669":{"dur":3,"text":"So it tie in briefly with reunion,\nhomecoming,"},"2673":{"dur":4,"text":"one way that people find you can achieve\na sort of immortality is to embed yourself"},"2678":{"dur":5,"text":"in multi-generational social traditions\nthat connect you to communities."},"2684":{"dur":5,"text":"To lose yourself in enduring traditions\nthat connect you across time."},"2689":{"dur":5,"text":"And this guy is definitely\ntranscending the self, as an example."},"2695":{"dur":2,"text":">> [LAUGH]\n>> And so"},"2697":{"dur":3,"text":"losing yourself in these sorts\nof social traditions and"},"2700":{"dur":4,"text":"rituals, this is something the great\nsociologist Durkheim would say as a sort"},"2705":{"dur":4,"text":"of secular way to get to the same\nplaces that religion takes you to."},"2709":{"dur":3,"text":"A sense in which you've\novercome your individuality,"},"2712":{"dur":4,"text":"embedded yourself in groups, and\nbecome something or, in a way,"},"2717":{"dur":5,"text":"minimized yourself and embedded yourself\nin something bigger than just you."},"2723":{"dur":4,"text":"And maybe you already knew that,\nand maybe that's why your here."},"2729":{"dur":4,"text":"But another way to think about\na secular path to immortality"},"2733":{"dur":3,"text":"is to maybe view the world the way\npeople like me do, social scientists."},"2737":{"dur":3,"text":"So we social scientists tend to view\npeople as essentially the products"},"2741":{"dur":2,"text":"of their social influences."},"2743":{"dur":5,"text":"So to a sociologist, you are a collection\nof all the people who made you."},"2749":{"dur":3,"text":"So you are a collection of the lessons\nthat were taught to you by people"},"2753":{"dur":4,"text":"that

constructed"},"2786":{"dur":3,"text":"person, those all came from people who\nwere, themselves, socially constructed."},"2789":{"dur":2,"text":"That made up their personalities and"},"2792":{"dur":4,"text":"their life paths from these social\nopportunities and this interdependence."},"2796":{"dur":2,"text":"So every one of these people was,\nthemselves,"},"2798":{"dur":3,"text":"made up of all their social influences,\nand all the gifts that they received."},"2802":{"dur":3,"text":"But this interconnectedness that\nprecedes you across generations,"},"2806":{"dur":1,"text":"it doesn't end with you."},"2808":{"dur":3,"text":"Instead, you take part in sending it\non to new generations as well, right?"},"2811":{"dur":3,"text":"So you, in turn,\nsend your gifts onto new people."},"2815":{"dur":2,"text":"You teach people lessons."},"2818":{"dur":3,"text":"You offer your support to individuals
