{"1":{"dur":9,"text":"Hello. My name is Emma, and in today's lesson,\nI am going to teach you my top tips for the"},"10":{"dur":3,"text":"IELTS listening module. Okay?"},"13":{"dur":5,"text":"So, before I teach you these tips, you might\nbe wondering: \"What's the IELTS listening"},"19":{"dur":6,"text":"module?\" Well, the IELTS is a test and one\npart of the test is listening. So, in the"},"25":{"dur":6,"text":"listening section, you're going to have 40\nquestions where you're going to listen to"},"32":{"dur":7,"text":"some conversations for about 30 minutes, and\nthen you'll have 10 minutes to transfer your"},"39":{"dur":5,"text":"answers over to another sheet. So, in total,\nit's 40 minutes; 30 minutes for listening,"},"45":{"dur":2,"text":"10 minutes for writing down your answers."},"48":{"dur":7,"text":"Okay, now this part of the IELTS is very possible\nto get a high mark, especially if you follow"},"55":{"dur":6,"text":"my tips. All right? Now, before we get started,\nI just want to let you know: I know you can"},"61":{"dur":4,"text":"do the IELTS. I know you can pass, I know\nyou can get a great mark, a great bandwidth"},"66":{"dur":5,"text":"- you just have to have confidence in yourself\nand you have to practice. Practice, practice,"},"72":{"dur":4,"text":"practice; it really pays off.\nSo let's get started."},"77":{"dur":7,"text":"So, my first tip: write no more than three words.\nWhat do I mean by this? I don't mean"},"85":{"dur":6,"text":"for the whole thing, write no more than three words.\nOn the IELTS, you will have to read"},"91":{"dur":7,"text":"the instruction of what to do. Often times,\nthe instruction, before you listen, you're"},"98":{"dur":5,"text":"going to see: \"Write no more than three words.\"\nThis is an example of an instruction you must"},"104":{"dur":6,"text":"follow. One mistake a lot of students make\nduring the IELTS is they don't read instructions"},"110":{"dur":6,"text":"properly. They're nervous, they're stressed\nout, they write whatever, they don't... They"},"117":{"dur":5,"text":"don't follow the instructions. If you see\nsomething like: \"Write no more than three"},"123":{"dur":11,"text":"words.\" Do that. You can't write four, don't write five.\nWrite three or less. Okay? So"},"134":{"dur":5,"text":"my main point here: follow\nthe instructions carefully."},"140":{"dur":7,"text":"Point number two: get used to British English. A\nlarge part of the IELTS, you will be listening..."},"148":{"dur":5,"text":"For... For... Sorry, for the listening, you\nwill be listening to British accents. Sometimes"},"153":{"dur":5,"text":"you might hear Australian accents or Canadian,\nyou might hear a range, but a lot of the accents"},"158":{"dur":5,"text":"will be British. So it's very important to\nget used to listening to British accents."},"164":{"dur":6,"text":"And also, listen to other accents like Canadian,\nAustralian; that's a good idea too. Where"},"171":{"dur":6,"text":"can you find British accents to listen to? I\nrecommend the BBC. They have a lot of great"},"177":{"dur":6,"text":"videos there and most of it's with British\naccents, so it's a very good idea so you can"},"184":{"dur":5,"text":"practice listening. The more you practice\nlistening with British accents, the easier"},"189":{"dur":7,"text":"it will be to understand British speakers.\nEspecially if you're used to American English,"},"197":{"dur":3,"text":"this is a very good thing to do."},"201":{"dur":8,"text":"Related to this point: British vocab. You\nshould learn British vocabulary. For example:"},"210":{"dur":5,"text":"in American English and Canadian English, we say: \"truck\".\nIn British English, we say:"},"216":{"dur":7,"text":"\"lorry\". So it's good to know some of these\nBritish expressions, some British words. One"},"223":{"dur":6,"text":"idea where you can practice these is if you\ncheck out our website: www.engvid.com, we"},"230":{"dur":5,"text":"have a new teacher who is British and who\nwill be talking about British English, so"},"235":{"dur":6,"text":"check out her... Her videos. It will also be\ngood to help you with practicing listening"},"242":{"dur":2,"text":"to British accents."},"245":{"dur":9,"text":"Number four: spelling counts. Okay? Very important.\nThe listening part of the IELTS is not just"},"255":{"dur":6,"text":"listening; you're actually using other skills\nlike writing and reading. Now, with writing,"},"261":{"dur":4,"text":"when you write down your answers, you sometimes\nhave to spell something out, so you have to"},"266":{"dur":5,"text":"be very, very careful with spelling. Okay?\nThis is something you should really study"},"271":{"dur":6,"text":"and practice before you take the listening\npart of the IELTS. Practice your spelling."},"278":{"dur":6,"text":"Learn spelling rules. We have a lot of different\nvideos on how to spell on engVid, so I would"},"284":{"dur":2,"text":"come and check those ones out."},"287":{"dur":5,"text":"Number five - this is the thing that always\ngets my students and I always warn them about"},"293":{"dur":9,"text":"when we practice - plural versus singular. Okay?\nYou have to listen carefully on whether"},"302":{"dur":9,"text":"you're writing down the plural with an \"s\"\nor the singular. If the question wants me"},"312":{"dur":5,"text":"to write down: \"cat\", someone's talking about their\ncat and I write down: \"cats\", it's incorrect."},"318":{"dur":8,"text":"I would get an \"X\". Okay, so it's important to\nbe careful, to really listen: is it a singular"},"327":{"dur":7,"text":"thing, is it a plural thing? Are they\nsaying \"store\" or \"stores\"? Okay?"},"335":{"dur":8,"text":"Number six - this is probably the most obvious\ntip, but - very important to do practice tests."},"344":{"dur":6,"text":"There are many, many books out there on the\nIELTS that have practice tests with a CD."},"350":{"dur":4,"text":"You can listen and you can practice. The more\nyou do, the better, and the better your mark"},"355":{"dur":6,"text":"probably will be. Okay? So do as many practice\ntests as you can for the listening. And again,"},"362":{"dur":5,"text":"maybe when you start, it will be very difficult.\nMaybe you'll do a test and you'll do very"},"367":{"dur":7,"text":"poorly on it - a practice test - it's good to keep going.\nEven if you do bad at first,"},"374":{"dur":5,"text":"I'm sure the more you practice, the more you\nget used to these accents - you're going to"},"379":{"dur":4,"text":"do fine. Okay? Just keep practicing,\npracticing, practicing."},"385":{"dur":8,"text":"Number seven: prediction. It's very important on the IELTS.\nDuring the listening, at the"},"393":{"dur":6,"text":"end of each section, you have some time to\ncheck your answers and to read the questions"},"400":{"dur":6,"text":"that are coming up. Very important that you look ahead.\nOkay? Any time you have a chance"},"406":{"dur":5,"text":"to stop and to... to read ahead on the IELTS, the...\nthe listening part, it's very important"},"412":{"dur":7,"text":"to do this. The reason is you can make a guess,\nyou can predict... It's not exactly a guess,"},"419":{"dur":4,"text":"but you can predict what an answer is going\nto be, and your chance of getting that answer"},"424":{"dur":6,"text":"right is going to go up. So, for example,\nmaybe this is one of the questions:"},"430":{"dur":5,"text":"\"The woman will travel on __________.\" Okay,\nso I'm going to have to listen to the"},"436":{"dur":5,"text":"CD. Now, what I can do is in pencil, I can\njust write in what I think it's going to be."},"441":{"dur":8,"text":"Well, I see the word: \"travel\", \"travel on\",\nso maybe she's travelling on a bus, or maybe"},"450":{"dur":4,"text":"a plane. Okay. Think of some... some things\nshe might be travelling on. And then you can"},"455":{"dur":4,"text":"just write quickly what your prediction is.\nAnd then, when they actually play the... the"},"460":{"dur":6,"text":"tape, listen, see if your prediction was correct.\nIf it's not, you can just write in the correct"},"467":{"dur":5,"text":"answer. But you'll have a good chance of getting\nthe answer right. The listening goes very"},"472":{"dur":6,"text":"quickly so it's very good to do this prediction\nso you can prepare yourself. Know what they're"},"479":{"dur":4,"text":"looking for. Okay.\nPrediction, very important."},"483":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, let's learn some other tips to\nsucceed on this part of the test."},"488":{"dur":8,"text":"Okay, my next tip is about predicting again.\nBut if you can't predict the word - maybe"},"497":{"dur":5,"text":"there's not enough information - at least you\ncan predict if they're looking for a noun,"},"502":{"dur":7,"text":"adjective, adverb, or verb. Okay, so what's\nan example of this? I come over here. For"},"510":{"dur":4,"text":"the fill in the blank questions,\nmaybe it will say something like:"},"514":{"dur":6,"text":"\"She has three __________.\" Okay, she\nhas three, what? I have no idea;"},"520":{"dur":6,"text":"she could have three of anything. But what I\ndo know is this is going to be... What is"},"527":{"dur":8,"text":"it going to be? Is it going to be a verb? No.\nAdjective? No. It's going to be a noun."},"536":{"dur":6,"text":"Keyword: \"She has\", there's already a verb\nhere, I know it's going to be a noun. So that"},"543":{"dur":1,"text":"can help."},"545":{"dur":6,"text":"Next tip. This is one of the challenging things\nabout the IELTS, you're listening and writing"},"551":{"dur":7,"text":"at the same time. Okay? So, again, the listening\nis not only a listening; it's also listening,"},"558":{"dur":9,"text":"writing, reading, not speaking. So it's important\nthat you practice these skills together. What"},"567":{"dur":7,"text":"you can do is you can maybe go on the BBC,\nlisten to what they're saying, take notes."},"575":{"dur":5,"text":"Get used to writing quickly while you're listening.\nI think this is one of the most important"},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"skills you can learn."},"583":{"dur":8,"text":"Number 10 - this is the trick on the IELTS -\nbe aware of changes. Often times, they have"},"591":{"dur":6,"text":"a phone conversation in the listening and\nsomebody says something like: \"Oh, the number,"},"598":{"dur":7,"text":"it's 2078.\" And so you write: \"2078\". But\nthen they say: \"Oh, no, wait. I'm sorry. It's"},"605":{"dur":9,"text":"actually 4078.\" So you have to be very careful\nbecause often times, they will give information"},"614":{"dur":4,"text":"and then they will change it. They will say: \"Oh, I'm sorry.\nThat's the wrong information."},"618":{"dur":5,"text":"It's actually this number instead.\" Okay. So\nbe aware of that. The first time you write"},"624":{"dur":6,"text":"something down, they might change it, so\nkeep your ear out for that; listen for that."},"630":{"dur":7,"text":"Number 11. One thing to practice is listening\nto groups of numbers. Maybe you're good at"},"637":{"dur":6,"text":"listening to the number one, if I say: \"five\",\n\"seven\", you understand that. But if I say"},"644":{"dur":7,"text":"a lot of numbers at the same time like: \"My\nphone number is 971-225\" - it's not this,"},"652":{"dur":12,"text":"by the way, so don't call this number\n- \"1-877-43298\". Okay. I hope nobody has this number. But if"},"665":{"dur":5,"text":"I say something like that, were you able to\nwrite down all those numbers?\" All right?"},"670":{"dur":5,"text":"You've got to get used to listening to\nlarge groups of numbers in sequence."},"677":{"dur":4,"text":"Again, about the numbers because you often\nhave to listen to something about numbers"},"681":{"dur":8,"text":"in the IELTS. It's also important to listen\nfor the difference between \"13\" and \"30\","},"690":{"dur":10,"text":"\"14\" and \"40\", \"15\" and \"50\", and so on. Okay?\nSo the trick here is: \"13\", \"teen\" is usually"},"701":{"dur":10,"text":"louder, \"thir\" is quieter and shorter, versus:\n\"30\" where \"thir\" is longer, \"ty\" is shorter."},"711":{"dur":4,"text":"So get used to listening to these numbers so\nyou can actually hear the difference, because"},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"you might hear that on the IELTS."},"719":{"dur":8,"text":"Number 13, this is also very important. Your\nhandwriting must be clear. All right? If they"},"727":{"dur":3,"text":"can't read what you write, you're not going\nto get the marks for your answer. Even if"},"731":{"dur":6,"text":"it's correct, if they can't read it - that's a problem.\nSo if you have bad handwriting,"},"738":{"dur":6,"text":"this is something you should work on. Practice writing.\nStart off slow and then work on speed;"},"744":{"dur":5,"text":"get better and better and better, and faster at writing.\nAll right? So write well."},"750":{"dur":7,"text":"Number 14, this is my last tip of the day. With...\nAgain, this is with spelling because"},"757":{"dur":6,"text":"it's so important on the IELTS for the listening section.\nOne thing they often do is they'll"},"764":{"dur":5,"text":"have somebody spell something out. So maybe they'll...\nSomeone will be on the phone and"},"769":{"dur":9,"text":"they'll say their last name. \"My last name\nis Tattoli.\" Okay? And then they'll spell"},"778":{"dur":8,"text":"it. \"That's T-a-t-t-o-l-i.\" Now, one thing to\nbe careful of is often times they do these"},"787":{"dur":4,"text":"double lettering thing where when\nthey're on the phone, they'll say:"},"791":{"dur":9,"text":"\"It's T-a- double 't'-o-l-i.\" This means there are two \"t's\".\nSo if you hear the word: \"double\", \"double"},"801":{"dur":7,"text":"'t'\", \"double 'm'\", \"double 'n'\". My name has\na double \"m\". Be aware of that. It means"},"809":{"dur":3,"text":"you have to write down two of those.\nAll right?"},"813":{"dur":7,"text":"So I know you are going to do well on this test.\nIt's... It's... You can do it. It's"},"820":{"dur":6,"text":"all a matter of practice, practice, practice.\nAll right? And just constantly practicing"},"826":{"dur":5,"text":"to improve.
