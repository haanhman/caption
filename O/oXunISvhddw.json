do ask me, \"Why did I write\nthis book?\""},"109":{"dur":5,"text":"And it's a particularly interesting question,\nespecially for those who know me because I"},"114":{"dur":6,"text":"had spent at least a decade on Wall Street\nas a bonds trader and credit derivatives trader."},"121":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, I didn't do much writing then."},"123":{"dur":6,"text":"In fact, a friend of mine said

\"maybe.\""},"137":{"dur":6,"text":"So obviously, I was very motivated to write\nan 80-thousand-word manuscript."},"144":{"dur":7,"text":"And the truth of the matter is was I was very\nconcerned about the direction that the US"},"151":{"dur":1,"text":"was headed."},"153":{"dur":7,"text":"And this concern actually started as early\nas 2005, when I was working at a very large"},"160":{"dur":2,"text":"hedge fund."},"162":{"dur":6,"text":"At the time, I was trading credit derivatives\nand saw many structured product deals come"},"169":{"dur":2,"text":"across my

crisis."},"181":{"dur":4,"text":"And I had seen a lot of irregularities in\nthese deals."},"186":{"dur":4,"text":"And what confirmed my suspicions were that\nI had attended some of these

billion-dollar\ndeals--secured with nothing but baseball cards."},"204":{"dur":5,"text":"This was deeply concerning to me and I even\ntried to raise the flag with the SEC, suggesting"},"210":{"dur":2,"text":"that they investigate this market."},"212":{"dur":6,"text":"But when it became apparent that nothing was\ngonna get done, that was when I decided to"},"219":{"dur":1,"text":"leave Wall Street."},"221":{"dur":5,"text":"I had seen previous bubbles, such as the Asian\ncrisis, internet bubble, and I really believed"},"227":{"dur":7,"text":"that this was gonna be far worse in that someone\nhad to warn the public and alert them of what"},"235":{"dur":1,"text":"was happening."},"236":{"dur":2,"text":"I went into academia at that point."},"239":{"dur":6,"text":"And I proceeded to write a paper detailing\nhow some of this fraud was perpetrated."},"246":{"dur":4,"text":"And I tried to send it to various government\nofficials and the media."},"251":{"dur":5,"text":"In fact, one of my friends, who had worked\nat FOX Business, received a copy."},"256":{"dur":6,"text":"And so, when I got a call from a FOX producer,\nI thought that I was being invited to talk"},"263":{"dur":1,"text":"about my paper."},"265":{"dur":7,"text":"Unfortunately, she asked me, \"Ann, can you\nplease come on to debate whether Paris Hilton"},"272":{"dur":4,"text":"is a great American hero because she's a big\nconsumer?\""},"277":{"dur":7,"text":"Unfortunately, I didn't accept that invitation."},"284":{"dur":7,"text":"But that was indicative of some of the mentality\nthat was going on leading up to the crisis."},"291":{"dur":8,"text":"And so, when it finally happened, it was neither\nsurprising nor shocking to me."},"299":{"dur":5,"text":"What really actually surprised me was to the\nextent Wall Street and government having come"},"305":{"dur":1,"text":"together."},"307":{"dur":6,"text":"And so, when President Obama had Tim Geithner\nand Larry Summers, the very people that had"},"314":{"dur":7,"text":"Wall Street in their back pocket, join his\neconomic team, it wasn't Obama where I was"},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"deriving my hope for most of the nation."},"323":{"dur":4,"text":"Interestingly, it was really China."},"328":{"dur":8,"text":"For some of you who may remember, China was\na mere backward agricultural society only"},"337":{"dur":1,"text":"30 years ago."},"339":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, they were written off as a lost cause."},"342":{"dur":7,"text":"So, even though China was this great world\nempire for thousands of years, they had fallen"},"349":{"dur":9,"text":"to practically a semi-colonial state 200 years\nago, when Western nations invaded the nation."},"358":{"dur":7,"text":"And it was very shameful and embarrassing\nto many Chinese at the time, to folks like"},"365":{"dur":7,"text":"Deng Xiaoping and Xuan Li, who were the communist\nparty revolutionaries."},"373":{"dur":5,"text":"When they were intellectuals going to Paris,\nthey experienced firsthand the prejudice and"},"379":{"dur":4,"text":"the treatment that was very unfriendly from\nforeigners."},"383":{"dur":4,"text":"And they attributed a lot of this to the fact\nthat they thought it was because China was"},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"such a weak nation."},"390":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, they vowed to make China strong."},"393":{"dur":7,"text":"And so, this small group of friends turned\nthis kernel of an idea into this big movement"},"401":{"dur":6,"text":"that allowed them to eventually take over\nthe country in just 20 years."},"407":{"dur":6,"text":"Unfortunately, when they took over the nation,\nthey did not succeed in making China strong."},"413":{"dur":3,"text":"They, in fact, did the complete opposite."},"417":{"dur":5,"text":"Because they were so married to ideology,\nthey had many of the wrong people in place."},"423":{"dur":2,"text":"They obviously had some of the wrong policies\nin place."},"426":{"dur":7,"text":"And so, this plummeted the nation into a state\nwhere millions of people died from starvation."},"433":{"dur":6,"text":"In fact, more people died from that than in\nWorld War II."},"439":{"dur":7,"text":"But fortunately, some of these folks, such\nas Deng Xiaoping, did not give up the dream"},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"of making China strong."},"450":{"dur":5,"text":"They continued and persisted in trying out\nwhat would work for China."},"455":{"dur":5,"text":"And through trial and error over many different\npolicies, they finally came together and found"},"461":{"dur":5,"text":"a set of ideas that would help put China back\non the right track."},"467":{"dur":6,"text":"These set of ideas are basically what I discuss\nin my book."},"473":{"dur":8,"text":"I wrote this book believing that these ideas\nwould actually be workable in a democratic"},"481":{"dur":4,"text":"capitalist society--modified."},"486":{"dur":6,"text":"But there were certain elements that are true\nfor all societies."},"492":{"dur":6,"text":"And while I realize that these two countries\nare very different, there are also many similarities."},"499":{"dur":3,"text":"And I don't advocate everything China."},"502":{"dur":5,"text":"What I'm talking about are some of the best\npractices of China that we can learn from"},"508":{"dur":5,"text":"because all nations have their weaknesses\nand strengths."},"514":{"dur":5,"text":"And if we only dwell on the weaknesses, we\nare missing an opportunity to learn about"},"520":{"dur":4,"text":"what they do right because learning can be\na two-way street."},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"They've learned plenty from us."},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"And we can learn from them."},"529":{"dur":6,"text":"Because while the US is a very strong nation,\nwe're still not perfect."},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"We make many mistakes."},"538":{"dur":8,"text":"And so, if we can find a way to set aside\nour prejudices and the best from the West"},"547":{"dur":7,"text":"and integrate them with the best of the East,\nperhaps we can advance civilization and create"},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"a better world for all."},"556":{"dur":8,"text":"So, I do cover a lot of ideas in my book and\nI'm not gonna have enough time to go over"},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"all of them."},"567":{"dur":5,"text":"But I would like to highlight at least a couple\nmajor themes that I think are particularly"},"573":{"dur":5,"text":"relevant in the Presidential Election year."},"579":{"dur":5,"text":"One of the ideas I discuss is the idea of\nleadership selection."},"584":{"dur":7,"text":"Today, I think the United States is suffering\nfrom a crisis of leadership."},"592":{"dur":5,"text":"Our politicians are polling at historic lows."},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"Poll after poll show that."},"599":{"dur":8,"text":"\"60 Minutes\" recently reported that Congress\nhad an approval rating of nine percent."},"608":{"dur":6,"text":"And movements, such as Occupy Wall Street,\nhave been spreading like wildfire."},"614":{"dur":7,"text":"These are very disturbing trends because as\nsoon as a nation, where the people do not"},"621":{"dur":6,"text":"think their government is legitimate, government\ncould start taking more drastic actions in"},"628":{"dur":6,"text":"order to maintain the status quo and keep\nthe people in government in power."},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"And we're starting to see signs of this."},"638":{"dur":7,"text":"President Obama had signed a bill into law\non New Year's Eve so that any American now"},"646":{"dur":8,"text":"can be detained indefinitely by the military\nwithout trial, without evidence."},"654":{"dur":5,"text":"And this is actually a serious incursion into\nour civil rights."},"659":{"dur":8,"text":"It makes it more important than ever now that\nwe get the right leaders in place."},"668":{"dur":7,"text":"And while we've had all sorts attempts at\ncampaign reform as a way to improve the system,"},"676":{"dur":9,"text":"2008 still remains a record year where private\nmoney went into the election cycle so that"},"685":{"dur":8,"text":"today, democracy here is no longer really\n\"one person, one vote,\" but \"one dollar, one"},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"vote.\""},"695":{"dur":8,"text":"So, what can we learn from China in this regard,\nespecially since most people regard the Chinese"},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"government as a dictatorship?"},"706":{"dur":8,"text":"Well, if you ask many folks outside of the\nUS, in fact, you'll get a different opinion."},"714":{"dur":4,"text":"Some people regard China as having the best\ntechnocrats in the world."},"719":{"dur":5,"text":"And if you ask many of the Chinese citizens,\nthey have very high approval ratings of their"},"724":{"dur":1,"text":"government."},"725":{"dur":6,"text":"Pew Research, out of DC here, has conducted\nresearch polls, opinion polls in China for"},"732":{"dur":5,"text":"several years now consistently showing that\nthe opinion polls of the government have been"},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"hitting over 80 percent."},"742":{"dur":9,"text":"And this approval rating seems to be in sharp\ncontrast to the protests over land grants"},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"in the country."},"753":{"dur":7,"text":"But those protestors tend to be very critical\nof their local government officials, not of"},"761":{"dur":4,"text":"the people who are running the show in China."},"766":{"dur":6,"text":"So, how did they get this level of legitimacy\namong their people?"},"772":{"dur":1,"text":"What can we learn?"},"773":{"dur":10,"text":"Well, the Chinese have a belief that the honor\nof running a nation should only belong to"},"784":{"dur":3,"text":"the people who have earned the right to do\nit."},"788":{"dur":7,"text":"This idea of earned authority is very similar\nto the idea of a corporation where we don't"},"795":{"dur":5,"text":"elect a CEO to the top based on some popularity\ncontest."},"800":{"dur":1,"text":"No."},"801":{"dur":6,"text":"The person who gets to run the organization\nhas earned the right through an entire career,"},"807":{"dur":9,"text":"proving that they have the skills and the\nknowledge to produce beneficial change."},"817":{"dur":6,"text":"And so, if you want to go work in this Chinese\ncentral government, you first have to take"},"823":{"dur":4,"text":"a competency test by the time you're 35."},"827":{"dur":5,"text":"If you don't pass this test, then you must\nstay in the private sector."},"833":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is a very difficult test."},"835":{"dur":5,"text":"I personally have not seen it, but it has\na pass rating of less than 20 percent."},"840":{"dur":5,"text":"So, right off the bat, they attract a lot\nof the brightest minds in China to go work"},"846":{"dur":2,"text":"for the government."},"849":{"dur":9,"text":"And by having that cut-off, they restrict\nthe conflict of interest that can happen between"},"858":{"dur":5,"text":"the private and public sector--something that\nwe've seen in our own government."},"863":{"dur":8,"text":"Now, once you become a government official\nthere, you then are rotated to different positions"},"871":{"dur":3,"text":"in the government for five-year terms."},"874":{"dur":5,"text":"And you can't serve a position for more than\ntwo terms."},"880":{"dur":7,"text":"And while you're in this position, you get\nevaluated 360 degrees ala McKinsey-style."},"887":{"dur":2,"text":"And then if you do well, you get promoted."},"889":{"dur":1,"text":"And if you don't, you get demoted."},"891":{"dur":2,"text":"And your compensation reflects that."},"894":{"dur":6,"text":"And they try to do this so that they're aligning\nthe government's roles with the interests"},"900":{"dur":7,"text":"of society this way, so that it is about helping\nproduce productive change not based on money"},"907":{"dur":3,"text":"and compensation alone."},"911":{"dur":5,"text":"So for example, if you're government official,\nyou could be put in a position to be a university"},"917":{"dur":2,"text":"president of a major university."},"920":{"dur":5,"text":"Then you must demonstrate during that time\nhow you've improved that institution."},"925":{"dur":6,"text":"Perhaps you've increased the number of foreign\nexchange programs to other universities around"},"932":{"dur":1,"text":"the world."},"933":{"dur":6,"text":"Maybe the number of graduates from the university\nwent up in terms of their ability to get high-paying"},"940":{"dur":1,"text":"jobs."},"941":{"dur":4,"text":"So, they get measured on a number of factors."},"945":{"dur":4,"text":"And this happens throughout their entire career."},"949":{"dur":8,"text":"So, by the time they get considered to be\na high-level official for the Politburo or"},"957":{"dur":8,"text":"the Standing Committee, they would have already\nserved decades in their nation in various"},"966":{"dur":7,"text":"roles, showing that they have produced productive\nchange and have benefitted millions of Chinese."},"974":{"dur":5,"text":"So, many of these Chinese citizens then view\nthat these people at the top have a collective"},"979":{"dur":7,"text":"wisdom that they know what to do in terms\nof leading a nation--that they have selected"},"987":{"dur":3,"text":"the best people for the job."},"990":{"dur":7,"text":"Now, how can we take that an incorporate it\ninto the US because I'm obviously not advocating"},"997":{"dur":4,"text":"that someone must go through the ranks of\ngovernment here to become President of the"},"1001":{"dur":2,"text":"United States?"},"1003":{"dur":4,"text":"But what I'm saying is there's certain elements\nthat make sense."},"1007":{"dur":6,"text":"I suggest in my book, why not introduce a\ncompetency test for policy-makers here?"},"1014":{"dur":6,"text":"Today, the only are where we provide these\ntests are to our foreign service, who become"},"1020":{"dur":2,"text":"our ambassadors to other nations."},"1022":{"dur":5,"text":"But virtually every other agency doesn't require\nthis."},"1028":{"dur":8,"text":"And our system today, where the saying \"to\nvictor go the spoils\" is more true than ever."},"1037":{"dur":6,"text":"When President Obama or anybody else becomes\nthe Head of State, will have the Plum Book"},"1043":{"dur":5,"text":"where they can appoint different high-level\npositions throughout government."},"1049":{"dur":5,"text":"These tend to go to people who are probably\ntheir high campaign donors or other people"},"1055":{"dur":3,"text":"who they owe political favors."},"1058":{"dur":4,"text":"And this may not necessarily be in the public\ninterest."},"1063":{"dur":7,"text":"For instance, President Bush had appointed\nMichael Brown to be head of FEMA during Hurricane"},"1070":{"dur":2,"text":"Katrina."},"1072":{"dur":5,"text":"This guy had no emergency management experience\nwhatsoever."},"1078":{"dur":2,"text":"And yet, he was charged to run this thing."},"1080":{"dur":2,"text":"And we saw the results of what happened."},"1083":{"dur":9,"text":"So, I am not suggesting we replace our systems,\nbut perhaps we improve it."},"1092":{"dur":7,"text":"And another idea is a thought, \"Well maybe\nwe should restrict the revolving door.\""},"1100":{"dur":6,"text":"Today, it's a well-known business model where\nsomeone can go get elected into Congress,"},"1106":{"dur":7,"text":"or work in a regulatory agency, and then leave\nand go the private sector, set up a shingle"},"1114":{"dur":6,"text":"on K Street and become a lobbyist and earn\nmillions of dollars that way."},"1120":{"dur":9,"text":"This sort of conflict of interest, again,\ncan be very harmful to the public interest."},"1129":{"dur":5,"text":"Another idea I bring up is perhaps we should\ndemand track records of people who want to"},"1135":{"dur":2,"text":"seek higher office."},"1137":{"dur":7,"text":"This could be a great way to vet who is qualified\nso that they have to have shown they've led"},"1144":{"dur":7,"text":"an organization and have provided beneficial\nchange, that they have shown that they have"},"1151":{"dur":5,"text":"the moral compass to help society."},"1157":{"dur":9,"text":"Another major theme I wanna talk about is\nthe idea of having long-term visions because"},"1166":{"dur":9,"text":"today, I really worry that our nation is suffering\nfrom a disease that I call \"short-termism.\""},"1176":{"dur":6,"text":"We have politicians who can really only think\nin terms of two-year election cycles."},"1183":{"dur":9,"text":"We have a lot of corporations who have to\nmeet short-term profits demanded by Wall Street."},"1192":{"dur":6,"text":"I don't think there are enough people who\nare actually taking a step back and asking,"},"1199":{"dur":6,"text":"\"Where do we wanna be in 10, 20 years' time\nand how are we gonna get there?\""},"1206":{"dur":8,"text":"So again, I turn to the Chinese system and\nsay, \"Where can we learn here?\""},"1214":{"dur":5,"text":"The Chinese have institutionalized something\ncalled \"the five-year plans\" as a way to avoid"},"1220":{"dur":2,"text":"the temptation to have short-term Band-Aids."},"1222":{"dur":8,"text":"I know a lot of folks have dismissed this\nidea because they associate five-year plans"},"1231":{"dur":6,"text":"with central planning of top-down and of the\ndisasters under Mao."},"1238":{"dur":6,"text":"But what I'm suggesting today is that the\nway they practice five-year plans now is very"},"1244":{"dur":2,"text":"different from what happened then."},"1246":{"dur":8,"text":"Today, it is more of a goal-setting exercise\nwhere the government articulates their priorities"},"1255":{"dur":4,"text":"of where they'd like to see the economy in\nthe future."},"1259":{"dur":6,"text":"And therefore, they set performance targets\nassociated with different areas of the economy."},"1266":{"dur":9,"text":"For instance, in their latest five-year plan--2011\nto 2015--they articulate that they would like"},"1275":{"dur":2,"text":"to see a greener economy."},"1278":{"dur":3,"text":"So, how are they gonna get there?"},"1281":{"dur":6,"text":"They put specific performance targets such\nas, they wanna reduce carbon emissions by"},"1287":{"dur":6,"text":"17 percent per GDP unit by the time they hit\n2015."},"1293":{"dur":8,"text":"They want to increase energy efficiency in\nbuildings by 16 percent per unit of GDP."},"1302":{"dur":7,"text":"And the people who are charged with making\nthese changes will have the autonomy to come"},"1309":{"dur":6,"text":"up with a variety of solutions that will help\nthem get there that incorporate the power"},"1315":{"dur":1,"text":"of the private sector."},"1317":{"dur":9,"text":"So, they will use a combination of carrots\nand sticks such as tax hikes on high polluting"},"1326":{"dur":10,"text":"industries, tax incentives for clean tech,\nand various other investments that will be"},"1336":{"dur":6,"text":"very inviting for foreign companies in the\nUS, in Europe, to come in and work jointly"},"1343":{"dur":5,"text":"with the Chinese in order to come up with\nthese solutions that will help them meet this"},"1348":{"dur":1,"text":"target."},"1350":{"dur":8,"text":"Now, the closest thing the US has to this\nkind of top-down priority setting is the US"},"1358":{"dur":3,"text":"Federal Budget."},"1361":{"dur":8,"text":"The OMB basically prepares this for the President\nthat should reflect his spending priorities."},"1370":{"dur":6,"text":"And basically, they make the allocations to\ndifferent agencies."},"1376":{"dur":5,"text":"The difference is that there are almost no\nperformance targets associated with how we"},"1382":{"dur":2,"text":"allocate our taxpayer money."},"1384":{"dur":9,"text":"It is the equivalent of a CEO having a strategic\nplan where he would hand over money to a department"},"1394":{"dur":7,"text":"and not demanding that they produce any results\nas a result of having received that money."},"1401":{"dur":6,"text":"Now, if we have this situation, it is no wonder\nthat our taxpayer money goes into all these"},"1408":{"dur":5,"text":"agencies and it's like a black hole where\nwe don't see any results."},"1413":{"dur":5,"text":"After trillions of dollars of spending, we\nstill have significant unemployment in this"},"1419":{"dur":2,"text":"country."},"1421":{"dur":3,"text":"We are also the largest spender in health\ncare."},"1425":{"dur":6,"text":"And yet, we have some of the worst outcomes\nin health care out of all developed nations."},"1431":{"dur":8,"text":"So perhaps, if we borrow this idea of setting\nperformance targets that the Chinese use,"},"1440":{"dur":7,"text":"it might drive more transparency and more\naccountability in our government to help align"},"1448":{"dur":5,"text":"what they're doing with the rest of society."},"1453":{"dur":8,"text":"I guess I'm running a little low on time,\nso maybe I'll just wrap up here for now and"},"1461":{"dur":3,"text":"then open it up to questions."},"1465":{"dur":2,"text":"And I understand there will be book-signing\nafterwards."},"1468":{"dur":3,"text":"So, there's a microphone there, right?"},"1471":{"dur":4,"text":"Are there any questions?"},"1475":{"dur":7,"text":">>male #1: So I actually don't doubt your\nassertion that Chinese run by technocrats,"},"1483":{"dur":2,"text":"at least at the top."},"1485":{"dur":5,"text":"I think Hu Jintao is widely respected as a\nvery technical person."},"1490":{"dur":2,"text":"My question is what's really their motivation?"},"1493":{"dur":6,"text":"Because it appears that in the developed world,\nas well as in the developing world, most politicians"},"1499":{"dur":2,"text":"are motivated by money and power, right?"},"1501":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's why the corruption in the system."},"1504":{"dur":4,"text":"So, what motivates the top leaders in China\nand why do think there's no corruption there"},"1508":{"dur":1,"text":"at the top?"},"1510":{"dur":9,"text":">>Ann Lee: I think that it's a way of weeding\nand trying to find the

people do not take competency tests\nand do not get rotated around."},"1539":{"dur":5,"text":"These people stay in these towns for 40 years,\nright?"},"1545":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's where all the corruption is, where\nthey have absolute power and there's no way"},"1549":{"dur":1,"text":"to kick them out."},"1551":{"dur":5,"text":"And that's why the Chinese government, right\nnow, is trying to
