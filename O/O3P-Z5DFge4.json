else."},"310":{"dur":5,"text":"So my story-- hopefully you can\nread the quotes up here, too."},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"So a lot of everything\nI'm going to say"},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"is pretty much in \"Pause\" today."},"320":{"dur":4,"text":"So what I want to share the\nmost is basically my story."},"325":{"dur":5,"text":"So back in 2011, I'd been\nat Google about five years."},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was in a role in\nthe gTech community, which"},"332":{"dur":8,"text":"is our internal customer service\nteam, and I wasn't doing well."},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"For whatever reason things\nweren't going great."},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"I was kind of in this rut."},"346":{"dur":1,"text":"I was burning out."},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"And how many people,\njust show of hands,"},"349":{"dur":1,"text":"has ever felt that way?"},"351":{"dur":1,"text":"Like in a burned out\nstate, or just rotten,"},"352":{"dur":1,"text":"you can't figure\nout what's going on?"},"354":{"dur":1,"text":"You're like, what's going on?"},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"I feel like I'm doing\nOK, but for whatever"},"358":{"dur":1,"text":"reason things aren't working."},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"So in the room a lot\nof hands were raised."},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"And the idea is that--"},"365":{"dur":1,"text":"I wasn't about effort."},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"I really wanted to do well, but\nI was kind of new in the role."},"369":{"dur":4,"text":"About six months in, managing\na team of customer support"},"373":{"dur":3,"text":"people, and things\nweren't going great."},"377":{"dur":3,"text":"I was getting feedback that my\nperformance wasn't doing well."},"380":{"dur":1,"text":"My performance was suffering."},"382":{"dur":4,"text":"And I actually had this whole\nlist of things to improve upon,"},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"which were very tactical\nand helpful for me."},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"So I had this plan in place."},"392":{"dur":1,"text":"Hold on a second, I\ngot some water here."},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"And I didn't know what to do."},"399":{"dur":1,"text":"Everything I was trying,\nI was like, today"},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going to go in there and\nmy meetings will be different."},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll communicate effectively."},"405":{"dur":0,"text":"I'll be more present."},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll have other things to share."},"409":{"dur":3,"text":"And to whatever effect, I\njust kept feeling burned out."},"412":{"dur":5,"text":"And my mental state was one\nwhere I was feeding myself"},"417":{"dur":2,"text":"stories that things\nwould never get better,"},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"or that I wasn't doing well."},"423":{"dur":1,"text":"Tapes, I call them,\nplayed in my mind."},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"Like, Rachael,\nthere you go again."},"428":{"dur":1,"text":"Why are you even bothering?"},"429":{"dur":1,"text":"Or why don't you\njust quit today?"},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"Or you're a failure."},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"So all of this was going on."},"435":{"dur":3,"text":"And I reached a point where\nmy manager was basically like,"},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"this isn't a fit for you."},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"And that is one of\nthe signs, by the way,"},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"that you need a pause\nwhen someone tells you"},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"it's not working out."},"446":{"dur":3,"text":"So I was faced with a choice."},"449":{"dur":3,"text":"And I went home that day,\nit was a Friday afternoon."},"453":{"dur":3,"text":"And I went home riding my\nbike home in San Francisco."},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was like, what do I do?"},"458":{"dur":0,"text":"Do I quit?"},"459":{"dur":1,"text":"Do I just keep trying?"},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think I like\nGoogle, but I don't know."},"463":{"dur":1,"text":"And my mental state\njust wasn't in a place"},"465":{"dur":3,"text":"to really think clearly."},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"So what happened\nwas I got on a Skype"},"470":{"dur":3,"text":"that weekend with a couple\ngirlfriends and someone"},"474":{"dur":4,"text":"suggested that Google might have\nthis leave of absence program."},"478":{"dur":3,"text":"And I was like,\noh, that's right."},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"They do have a leave\nof absence program."},"484":{"dur":1,"text":"I should look into that."},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that weekend\nI spent researching"},"487":{"dur":3,"text":"the leave of absence\nprogram and made a case"},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"to take three months\nof unpaid leave."},"493":{"dur":4,"text":"And so Monday morning\nI came back to Google,"},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"and I made the\nrequest to my manager."},"502":{"dur":1,"text":"And she was as\nsurprised as I had"},"504":{"dur":1,"text":"been to learn that\nwe had a program,"},"506":{"dur":4,"text":"or that that would be a good\nidea, and said, that sounds"},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"like a good fit as well."},"512":{"dur":4,"text":"Let me take it to HR and see\nif we can get it approved."},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"And what happened was\nI got it approved."},"518":{"dur":3,"text":"And this was the\nbeginning of what"},"521":{"dur":5,"text":"I would call my pause, which I\ndefine as any intentional shift"},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"in behavior."},"528":{"dur":3,"text":"So it doesn't mean it's a\nlong-term break like I had,"},"532":{"dur":1,"text":"but it can be."},"533":{"dur":5,"text":"So I ended up taking three\nmonths of unpaid leave in--"},"538":{"dur":3,"text":"it was the summer of 2011."},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"And the terms were that I would\ncome back to Google, ideally,"},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"but I wouldn't be\nin the same role,"},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"and I would hire a\nreplacement when I returned."},"550":{"dur":3,"text":"And so all of that happened\nbefore I left, which was great."},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"I had about a month\nand a half to do that."},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"And I didn't know if I\nwas going to come back"},"557":{"dur":0,"text":"to Google, actually."},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"And I just really\nhad no idea, other"},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"than I knew I needed to\nmove into a new state,"},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"and I couldn't continue\nas things were going."},"566":{"dur":4,"text":"It wasn't effective for me,\nand I really wasn't happy."},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's a little bit\nabout the background"},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"of how this all happened."},"574":{"dur":4,"text":"And looking back now, five years\nago, if I had known any of this"},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"would have been\nthe case, and this"},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"would be how things\nhave turned out,"},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"I would have been\nreally surprised."},"584":{"dur":3,"text":"Because I was just\nabout the end of my rope"},"588":{"dur":4,"text":"and not sure what to\ndo and what happened."},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"So that three months of\nunpaid break was me unwinding."},"596":{"dur":3,"text":"It was me kind of reassessing\nwhere I wanted to go."},"599":{"dur":1,"text":"I didn't know if I was\non the right career path."},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"I didn't know if I\nshould stay at Google,"},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"but I was pretty\nsure I liked Google."},"607":{"dur":3,"text":"And it was really this\nunknown time for me."},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was the first time\nin my life for a few things."},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"And one of them was to\nreally be with myself."},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"Meaning, looking at my\ncareer, looking at who I was,"},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"and being like, is\nthis what I want?"},"620":{"dur":3,"text":"Is this the path that\nI want to stay on?"},"624":{"dur":3,"text":"And so that led to a whole\nother bunch of discoveries--"},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"many, many discoveries\nsince then."},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"So the good news is that was\nthe opening, I'll call it,"},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"kind of the first doorway\nthat I walked through."},"635":{"dur":2,"text":"And then that led\nto a lot more that"},"637":{"dur":1,"text":"ended up happening\nas I did return"},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"to Google in September of 2011."},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"And I looked for\na new role, and I"},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"got a new job, which is the job\nthat I have now and the team"},"646":{"dur":0,"text":"that I'm on now."},"650":{"dur":4,"text":"So that is my story\nin a nutshell."},"654":{"dur":4,"text":"And so since then I came\nback to Google, and maybe"},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"about eight months\nlater, I started"},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"thinking about wanting\nto share my story."},"663":{"dur":1,"text":"And I didn't really\nknow how to do it,"},"665":{"dur":3,"text":"but I started to\nwrite a document which"},"669":{"dur":1,"text":"later became the book."},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"And one of the first\nthemes I captured"},"673":{"dur":4,"text":"was, how do you know if you need\nthis so-called break, or pause,"},"677":{"dur":1,"text":"or a shift in behavior?"},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"So I came up with\nthese five signs."},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"And each of these\nsigns, the idea"},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"is that you might have one\nof these happen to you,"},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"or maybe all five of them\nhave happened to you."},"689":{"dur":3,"text":"In my case-- and I'll go\nover them in a second--"},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"I think I had all of\nthem happen to me."},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"So I kind of did the tally and\ndecided that, yeah, this is"},"697":{"dur":3,"text":"a good way that you can pause."},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'll walk you\nthrough the five signs."},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"The first sign is you\nused to love your job,"},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"and now you loathe it."},"708":{"dur":3,"text":"Pretty self-explanatory, right?"},"712":{"dur":0,"text":"So that was my case."},"713":{"dur":3,"text":"I used to really enjoy being\nat my work in the day to day."},"717":{"dur":1,"text":"And all of a sudden\nit was like, just"},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"things weren't going\ngreat, and I didn't even"},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"want to be there anymore."},"722":{"dur":1,"text":"So that was the first sign."},"723":{"dur":6,"text":"Second sign, you\nknow need a break,"},"730":{"dur":3,"text":"and you used to love your job,\nand then your manager tells you"},"734":{"dur":0,"text":"it's not working out."},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"I mentioned that this\none was also experienced."},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"So this might come as a\nreally direct message."},"740":{"dur":1,"text":"It could be something\nyou hear in the hallway."},"742":{"dur":1,"text":"It might be something\na coworker says to you,"},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"or even a friend who's like,\nyou sound miserable there."},"746":{"dur":1,"text":"What's going on?"},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"But in my case, I call it\nthe proverbial pink slip."},"752":{"dur":4,"text":"But basically, it was my manager\nhaving a heart to heart with me"},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"and saying this really\nwasn't a fit for me."},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"And at the end looking\nback, and even at the time,"},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"I knew she was right."},"764":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's the second sign."},"765":{"dur":4,"text":"And the third sign is that you\nhave a technology intervention"},"769":{"dur":2,"text":"from a friend, or someone\nwho really cares about you,"},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"or even just knows you\nas an acquaintance."},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"And we can all probably\nidentify with that one."},"777":{"dur":4,"text":"The idea is that if you're\non your phone all the time,"},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"or you're missing\nout on relationships"},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"because you're tethered\nto a laptop, and I was."},"786":{"dur":1,"text":"I was tethered to\nmy email, and I"},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"would be checking it\nlike Sunday afternoons"},"790":{"dur":1,"text":"to get ready for Monday."},"791":{"dur":1,"text":"That's a sign."},"793":{"dur":1,"text":"And if it's interfering\nwith how you"},"795":{"dur":3,"text":"are with other people, or\nyour family, or other ways"},"798":{"dur":1,"text":"that you want to\nbe in the world,"},"799":{"dur":3,"text":"then that's a telltale\nsign, in my opinion."},"802":{"dur":3,"text":"And the fourth sign is\nthat there is an overcoming"},"806":{"dur":1,"text":"challenge that you face."},"808":{"dur":2,"text":"And this could be something\nlike a health challenge,"},"811":{"dur":4,"text":"or a family member\nthat has become someone"},"815":{"dur":3,"text":"that you need to be paying more\nattention to, or ill, or sick,"},"818":{"dur":1,"text":"or something like that."},"820":{"dur":1,"text":"Could be a layoff."},"821":{"dur":1,"text":"But basically in\nadversity-- something"},"823":{"dur":2,"text":"that you're faced\nwith that isn't"},"826":{"dur":2,"text":"exactly what you'd planned,\nand you got to deal with it."},"828":{"dur":3,"text":"So who can relate to that one?"},"831":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah, I think that one's\na pretty common one."},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"And then the last one is\nthat there is actually"},"836":{"dur":1,"text":"an opportunity that comes up."},"838":{"dur":4,"text":"So this one can be in\nmultiple different ways."},"842":{"dur":5,"text":"But the idea is that there might\nbe some nagging opportunity"},"847":{"dur":3,"text":"that you want to pursue,\nor an idea that you"},"851":{"dur":1,"text":"have to follow through with."},"852":{"dur":4,"text":"It might be something as easy as\na class that you want to take."},"857":{"dur":3,"text":"But it could be something like\na weekend with a friend who's"},"860":{"dur":3,"text":"been wanting you to go for\nyears on a certain trip."},"864":{"dur":2,"text":"It might be an idea to have\na business that you start."},"866":{"dur":1,"text":"It could be a whole bunch\nof different things."},"868":{"dur":1,"text":"And so the idea is\nthat, again, this"},"869":{"dur":1,"text":"is an intentional\nshift in behavior."},"871":{"dur":1,"text":"So if this is something\nthat's going on,"},"873":{"dur":2,"text":"and you kind of think about\nthings, more than even a couple"},"875":{"dur":2,"text":"of times a day, then\nthat might be a good sign"},"878":{"dur":1,"text":"to know that a\npause is something"},"880":{"dur":1,"text":"that could be helpful."},"881":{"dur":1,"text":"So those are the five\nsigns, and I kind of"},"883":{"dur":1,"text":"went through them quickly."},"884":{"dur":1,"text":"But the idea is if you\ngo through each one"},"886":{"dur":1,"text":"of those mentally\nand give yourself"},"887":{"dur":3,"text":"a point for any of those,\nif you score a one, that"},"891":{"dur":1,"text":"means you're doing pretty well."},"892":{"dur":3,"text":"But if you have maybe even\nmore than two, two or more,"},"895":{"dur":1,"text":"chances are a pause would\nbe a really good idea."},"897":{"dur":2,"text":"And the good news is\neveryone can pause."},"900":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's a big\nmessage I have today"},"902":{"dur":2,"text":"is that it's

are"},"916":{"dur":2,"text":"levers that you can play with."},"918":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's many different\ntypes of pauses to have,"},"920":{"dur":1,"text":"and I mention this right there."},"922":{"dur":4,"text":"So they can go from\na simple thing,"},"926":{"dur":1,"text":"like following your breath."},"927":{"dur":3,"text":"And how many people here do any\ntypes of mindful

device pausing."},"960":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is a big one."},"962":{"dur":1,"text":"So digital device\npausing, if there"},"964":{"dur":4,"text":"is an idea where you think\nyou're on your phone too much,"},"968":{"dur":2,"text":"or you're checking it when\nyou go to the bathroom,"},"971":{"dur":3,"text":"or you are sleeping with\nit under your pillow,"},"974":{"dur":0,"text":"things like that."},"975":{"dur":2,"text":"I think they are\nactually real cases."},"977":{"dur":4,"text":"And the idea is that\nthat's OK, but make sure"},"981":{"dur":2,"text":"that the boundaries that you\nhave for those digital devices"},"983":{"dur":2,"text":"are in service to you."},"986":{"dur":2,"text":"So is it taking\nyou away from being"},"989":{"dur":1,"text":"with others or the moment?"},"990":{"dur":2,"text":"Or you're not really, fully\npresent in one activity?"},"993":{"dur":2,"text":"So digital device pauses\nare a big, big deal."},"996":{"dur":2,"text":"And more than ever,\nthey matter, and you"},"998":{"dur":1,"text":"can experiment with that."},"999":{"dur":3,"text":"So it might be setting\nup a rule for yourself."},"1002":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm a big fan of rules so you\ncan get into some boundaries"},"1006":{"dur":0,"text":"and creating things."},"1007":{"dur":1,"text":"So not checking your\nphone after 9:00 PM,"},"1009":{"dur":2,"text":"or staying off social\nmedia on the weekends."},"1011":{"dur":2,"text":"That's one I actually recently\nstarted, and I liked it."},"1014":{"dur":3,"text":"Although, it won't be\nhappening right now."},"1017":{"dur":1,"text":"Then you can expand from there."},"1019":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's other\nways you can pause."},"1022":{"dur":3,"text":"And if you have time to\ndo it for more than a day,"},"1025":{"dur":1,"text":"or it could be a\nweekend, or a week."},"1026":{"dur":1,"text":"And then there's\nthe extended pauses,"},"1028":{"dur":2,"text":"like I had for three\nmonths, which is amazing."},"1031":{"dur":4,"text":"And not a lot of us have\nthat luxury, I know."},"1035":{"dur":2,"text":"There's actually a\nstatistic from the Society"},"1037":{"dur":4,"text":"of Human Resource Management\nthat says about 14% to 15%"},"1041":{"dur":4,"text":"of global companies allow\nfor unpaid or paid breaks."},"1045":{"dur":2,"text":"There's only 4% of companies\nthat have paid breaks."},"1048":{"dur":3,"text":"So knowing that's not an\noption for a lot of us,"},"1052":{"dur":3,"text":"my point is that you can\npause and integrate that"},"1055":{"dur":1,"text":"It doesn't have to be\na long type of break"},"1057":{"dur":2,"text":"that you need to take."},"1060":{"dur":4,"text":"And then the other type of\npause is the unintended pause."},"1064":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is when\nyou get laid off,"},"1066":{"dur":4,"text":"or you have this huge shift that\nyou weren't planning to have."},"1070":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think a lot of\nus go through this"},"1072":{"dur":1,"text":"at some point in our life."},"1073":{"dur":4,"text":"But the idea is that it's\neasy to get stuck in a victim"},"1078":{"dur":4,"text":"mentality, or maybe just sulk\naround, and now say, well,"},"1082":{"dur":0,"text":"now what?"},"1083":{"dur":2,"text":"But the actual idea is if\nyou are intentional about it,"},"1085":{"dur":4,"text":"that time is an amazing gift\nthat you can have for yourself"},"1089":{"dur":2,"text":"and choose how you want\nto live differently."},"1092":{"dur":2,"text":"It might be during that time,\nor it might be shifting careers,"},"1094":{"dur":2,"text":"or it might be looking\nfor something that really"},"1096":{"dur":2,"text":"does align with you more."},"1099":{"dur":3,"text":"So those are all types\nof pauses and great ways"},"1102":{"dur":3,"text":"to integrate intentional\nshifts in behavior."},"1106":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's even a thing\ncalled mini pauses."},"1109":{"dur":3,"text":"I write about these in the book\nfrom Dr. David King Keller."},"1112":{"dur":3,"text":"He did a PhD on pausing, which\nis pretty cool, in my opinion."},"1116":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's a couple\nexercises in the book,"},"1118":{"dur":2,"text":"and maybe we'll do one\nof those in the demo."},"1120":{"dur":1,"text":"Hey, look at that."},"1122":{"dur":4,"text":"So next we're going to\ntry one of these out."},"1126":{"dur":3,"text":"And we're a little limited,\nbecause we're here in the room."},"1129":{"dur":1,"text":"But if you're with\nme in the room,"},"1131":{"dur":2,"text":"go ahead and just get\ncomfortable, and maybe"},"1133":{"dur":1,"text":"put your feet on the floor."},"1134":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're not in the room\nand you're watching this"},"1137":{"dur":2,"text":"at home or at work,\ndo the same thing,"},"1139":{"dur":3,"text":"follow along, and try\nhow this is for you."},"1142":{"dur":3,"text":"So we're going to try\none of these micro pauses"},"1145":{"dur":1,"text":"from Dr. Keller."},"1147":{"dur":1,"text":"And what we're going to do is--"},"1148":{"dur":1,"text":"I think it's called\nthe two palm pause."},"1150":{"dur":2,"text":"So go ahead and\nI'll face this way."},"1153":{"dur":5,"text":"Put your two hands up about\nsix inches from your nose"},"1158":{"dur":1,"text":"and notice your hands."},"1164":{"dur":7,"text":"Scanning them for the\ntexture, lines, color."},"1178":{"dur":1,"text":"Notice your breathing."},"1185":{"dur":3,"text":"And go ahead and\nput your hands down."},"1188":{"dur":2,"text":"How did that feel?"},"1191":{"dur":2,"text":"Did anyone notice a shift?"},"1193":{"dur":1,"text":"I did."},"1195":{"dur":5,"text":"Yeah, so that's literally a 30\nsecond pause that you can take."},"1200":{"dur":2,"text":"And it really does wonders."},"1202":{"dur":2,"text":"And then there's a couple\nmore like that that he has."},"1204":{"dur":3,"text":"And then my favorite go-to\nis just following the breath."},"1208":{"dur":1,"text":"So you can go ahead\nand put one hand"},"1210":{"dur":2,"text":"on your belly or your\nstomach, go ahead"},"1212":{"dur":7,"text":"and inhale, [INHALES]\nand exhale, [EXHALES]"},"1219":{"dur":1,"text":"and do it one more time."},"1220":{"dur":6,"text":"Inhale through your nose,\n[INHALES] [EXHALES] Exhale"},"1226":{"dur":0,"text":"your mouth."},"1227":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can close your\neyes or open your eyes."},"1229":{"dur":1,"text":"We'll take one more."},"1230":{"dur":7,"text":"[INHALES] [EXHALES] Go\nahead and open your eyes."},"1238":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's the\ndaily breath pause."},"1240":{"dur":4,"text":"And again, that took\nmaybe 30 seconds."},"1244":{"dur":3,"text":"And every chapter I have\nexercises that you can try that"},"1247":{"dur":3,"text":"are related to pausing\nor journaling exercises."},"1250":{"dur":2,"text":"And the idea is that you\ncan increase that time,"},"1253":{"dur":3,"text":"or go up to 10 breaths\nand count to 10,"},"1256":{"dur":2,"text":"and increase your\nskill level in it."},"1259":{"dur":3,"text":"It's actually more like\nlifting weights at the gym."},"1262":{"dur":4,"text":"So those are some really\nquick demos that we just did."},"1266":{"dur":3,"text":"But the idea is that, again,\nit's about what works for you."},"1270":{"dur":3,"text":"So as you decide and think\nabout what kind of pausing"},"1274":{"dur":3,"text":"would resonate with you-- it\nmight be things to do outside."},"1278":{"dur":1,"text":"It might be journaling."},"1279":{"dur":2,"text":"It might be these micro pauses."},"1281":{"dur":3,"text":"It could be a solo\nretreat for yourself,"},"1285":{"dur":2,"text":"as scary as that might sound."},"1287":{"dur":3,"text":"All of those are\noptions, and I encourage"},"1290":{"dur":2,"text":"you to look at\nwhat works for you"},"1293":{"dur":3,"text":"and see what would really\nresonate and then try it."},"1296":{"dur":3,"text":"Because the idea is that\neverything is an experiment."},"1300":{"dur":2,"text":"And in the book, I talk about\nDr. Carol Dweck and her growth"},"1303":{"dur":2,"text":"mindset research."},"1305":{"dur":2,"text":"Has anyone heard of\nCarol and her research?"},"1307":{"dur":1,"text":"I think most of us here have."},"1308":{"dur":0,"text":"Yeah."},"1309":{"dur":4,"text":"So the idea is that if\nyou bring your curiosity,"},"1313":{"dur":4,"text":"and an open mind, and that\nchildlike understanding"},"1318":{"dur":2,"text":"of what can I learn here--\nlearning and growing?"},"1321":{"dur":3,"text":"Then you will likely\nlearn or grow."},"1324":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you have that fixed\nmindset, it's not so easy,"},"1327":{"dur":2,"text":"and you kind of shut\ndown and are closed off."},"1329":{"dur":2,"text":"So I invite you to bring your--"},"1331":{"dur":2,"text":"I call it the pause\nmindset, as well."},"1333":{"dur":6,"text":"So it's this idea of being open\nto ideas and then acting on it."},"1340":{"dur":4,"text":"So those are a couple of\ndemos, and they're in the book"},"1344":{"dur":1,"text":"as well."},"1345":{"dur":6,"text":"Another idea that\nI have for pausing,"},"1351":{"dur":1,"text":"and I talk a lot about\nthis, where we've got"},"1353":{"dur":2,"text":"limiting beliefs in our world."},"1355":{"dur":2,"text":"And a lot of what I've been\nstudying at the Wright Graduate"},"1358":{"dur":4,"text":"University in Chicago, the\nWright Foundation with Bob"},"1363":{"dur":2,"text":"and Judith Wright is about\nwhat are our belief systems,"},"1365":{"dur":1,"text":"and where do we operate from?"},"1367":{"dur":3,"text":"Because each of us have these\nin our minds, in our heads,"},"1371":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's how we see the world."},"1373":{"dur":3,"text":"So this technique I call\nthe TASER technique,"},"1376":{"dur":3,"text":"and I think of it like mental\nflossing is kind of the overlay"},"1380":{"dur":0,"text":"here."},"1381":{"dur":2,"text":"Where think of\nlike dental floss,"},"1383":{"dur":1,"text":"and you're kind of going\nin between your teeth."},"1385":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm a big flosser."},"1386":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't know if we got\nany self-devoted flossers"},"1388":{"dur":0,"text":"in the room."},"1389":{"dur":2,"text":"But if you are in\nthere and getting"},"1391":{"dur":1,"text":"in between the\ngrooves in your teeth,"},"1393":{"dur":1,"text":"you're cleaning out the gunk."},"1394":{"dur":1,"text":"And we can't really do\nthat with our minds,"},"1396":{"dur":2,"text":"because they're obviously\nnot accessible that way."},"1398":{"dur":1,"text":"God knows what would happen."},"1400":{"dur":3,"text":"But you can think\nof it metaphorically"},"1403":{"dur":4,"text":"and know that when you\nare mental flossing,"},"1407":{"dur":1,"text":"you can have the same effect."},"1409":{"dur":3,"text":"So that means being conscious\nabout what your thoughts are"},"1412":{"dur":1,"text":"and what your beliefs are."},"1413":{"dur":1,"text":"So TASERing is an\nacronym, and it"},"1415":{"dur":7,"text":"stands for Tune In, Acknowledge,\nShift, Express, and Repeat."},"1423":{"dur":2,"text":"So the idea is that\nany belief that you"},"1425":{"dur":1,"text":"have that you don't\nthink is accurate--"},"1427":{"dur":2,"text":"so we'll do this together."},"1429":{"dur":2,"text":"So go ahead and think\nabout so far your day,"},"1431":{"dur":4,"text":"and maybe you've got an hour\nthat you've been in traffic,"},"1436":{"dur":3,"text":"or you're late and\nyou potentially"},"1439":{"dur":3,"text":"had an argument with a\npartner, or anything like that."},"1443":{"dur":1,"text":"Go ahead and what\nwas the thought that"},"1444":{"dur":3,"text":"went through your mind\nabout you as a belief?"},"1448":{"dur":3,"text":"In my case, I was\npreparing for the talk."},"1451":{"dur":1,"text":"I was looking at\nemails for my job."},"1453":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was like, why am I\nlooking at emails for my job?"},"1456":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not prepared."},"1458":{"dur":0,"text":"I'm not enough."},"1459":{"dur":1,"text":"That's a big one for me."},"1460":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's a belief that I have--"},"1461":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not enough."},"1463":{"dur":2,"text":"So if I were to take and\napply the TASER technique--"},"1466":{"dur":2,"text":"and think of TASER like a\nzap, like these stun guns."},"1469":{"dur":1,"text":"So T is Tune In."},"1470":{"dur":3,"text":"So, oh, OK, so my belief\nis I'm not enough."},"1474":{"dur":2,"text":"OK, well, that's great."},"1476":{"dur":0,"text":"Acknowledge it."},"1477":{"dur":0,"text":"OK."},"1478":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's my belief."},"1479":{"dur":0,"text":"And I'm not judging it."},"1480":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not like, there I go again."},"1482":{"dur":1,"text":"There's not really\na critic there,"},"1483":{"dur":3,"text":"but it's just acknowledging\nthat and simply knowing that."},"1486":{"dur":1,"text":"And shift is, what\nis the new belief"},"1488":{"dur":2,"text":"that I would want to replace\nthat with in this outdated"},"1491":{"dur":3,"text":"system I have in my mental map?"},"1494":{"dur":3,"text":"So my shift would be\npretty much the opposite"},"1497":{"dur":4,"text":"of what my belief is,\nwhich would be, what is it?"},"1502":{"dur":1,"text":"I am enough."},"1503":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah, it's really simple."},"1504":{"dur":2,"text":"It's just pretty\nmuch the opposite."},"1506":{"dur":0,"text":"And it's about me."},"1507":{"dur":0,"text":"It's not about somebody else."},"1508":{"dur":0,"text":"It's about me."},"1509":{"dur":2,"text":"So, oh, I am enough."},"1511":{"dur":1,"text":"And then expressing\nthat is either"},"1513":{"dur":1,"text":"saying it under my breath."},"1515":{"dur":2,"text":"It depends on where I am,\nbut I could say it out loud."},"1517":{"dur":1,"text":"I am enough."},"1518":{"dur":2,"text":"Like I am right now,\nso this is pretty cool."},"1521":{"dur":1,"text":"Or I could be writing\nit in a journal."},"1522":{"dur":2,"text":"And the idea is\nwhen we express, we"},"1524":{"dur":2,"text":"are creating new mental\nmaps in our brains."},"1527":{"dur":4,"text":"The neuroplasticity is there\nso that we can change the way"},"1531":{"dur":1,"text":"that our minds are working."},"1533":{"dur":3,"text":"And over time as we\nrepeat this, the R,"},"1536":{"dur":1,"text":"we're creating new\nways of thinking,"},"1538":{"dur":1,"text":"and new ways of\nbeing, and new habits."},"1540":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's not going\nto happen overnight."},"1542":{"dur":2,"text":"This is a long haul process."},"1544":{"dur":2,"text":"But the idea is that if we\nactually become conscious"},"1546":{"dur":2,"text":"of this-- and this is\none tool you can use--"},"1549":{"dur":1,"text":"then you might actually\nbe able to shift"},"1551":{"dur":4,"text":"some things around that are\nin better service to you."},"1555":{"dur":3,"text":"And so that you end up\nfeeling more satisfied or not"},"1559":{"dur":3,"text":"as in that mental\nmind tailspin like I"},"1562":{"dur":2,"text":"did when I was in\nmy burnout phase"},"1564":{"dur":2,"text":"at Google a couple of years ago."},"1567":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's one tool."},"1568":{"dur":3,"text":"And I invite you all to give it\na try today at least one more"},"1572":{"dur":1,"text":"time."},"1573":{"dur":0,"text":"OK."},"1574":{"dur":1,"text":"So we're not done\nyet, but I wanted"},"1575":{"dur":3,"text":"to just go ahead and actually\nanswer any questions that you"},"1579":{"dur":1,"text":"have that have come up so far."},"1581":{"dur":3,"text":"AUDIENCE: So thank you\nfor mentioning those five"},"1584":{"dur":2,"text":"identifiers of when\nsomeone needs a pause"},"1587":{"dur":2,"text":"and then doing a pause."},"1589":{"dur":4,"text":"So should there be a\npre-conception before the pause"},"1594":{"dur":1,"text":"that what should one\nachieve after that,"},"1595":{"dur":2,"text":"or should it be open ended?"},"1598":{"dur":3,"text":"So the question is,\nshould it be open ended?"},"1602":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a good question,\nbecause I think"},"1603":{"dur":2,"text":"that's the first\nquestion we all have."},"1606":{"dur":2,"text":"We want to jump to, well,\nwhat does this mean?"},"1608":{"dur":1,"text":"And do I need to\nhave it figured out?"},"1610":{"dur":2,"text":"And I know that was my question."},"1612":{"dur":2,"text":"And I didn't, and I was kind\nof freaking out about it,"},"1614":{"dur":1,"text":"because I didn't know\nwhat would happen."},"1616":{"dur":2,"text":"So I call this\nthe pause paradox."},"1619":{"dur":4,"text":"And the idea is that we're\ntaking a step back to be,"},"1624":{"dur":2,"text":"and not be so busy, or do."},"1626":{"dur":4,"text":"And our human mind\ntype A thinker brains"},"1631":{"dur":2,"text":"want to figure everything\nout really quickly."},"1633":{"dur":3,"text":"And so the paradox is you've\ngot all this time, why would"},"1637":{"dur":1,"text":"you not want to figure\nit out and think"},"1638":{"dur":3,"text":"about things as you reflect\nor you shift your behavior?"},"1642":{"dur":2,"text":"And my thought is I think it's\ngood to have broad strokes."},"1645":{"dur":2,"text":"I think it's healthy\nand a really good thing"},"1648":{"dur":1,"text":"to do to set your intention."},"1650":{"dur":2,"text":"So what do I want to have\ncome out of my weekend"},"1653":{"dur":2,"text":"as I reflect on my career shift?"},"1655":{"dur":5,"text":"Or what are the three\nthings I feel like I"},"1660":{"dur":1,"text":"want to do more with my family?"},"1662":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's intention."},"1663":{"dur":1,"text":"Those are changes."},"1665":{"dur":1,"text":"So I think broad\nstrokes are really good."},"1666":{"dur":1,"text":"And then I think the\nlittle things, like, well,"},"1668":{"dur":2,"text":"how am I going to do that?"},"1671":{"dur":2,"text":"What are the 10 things\nI need to do today"},"1673":{"dur":4,"text":"to make sure that I stay on\ntrack are maybe not as good."},"1677":{"dur":1,"text":"And again, it's an experiment."},"1679":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think it will be\ndifferent for all of us."},"1682":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think it depends\non what works for you."},"1685":{"dur":3,"text":"But I invite all of you\nto actually not plan,"},"1688":{"dur":3,"text":"because I think it's easy for\nour brains to get into that."},"1691":{"dur":2,"text":"And the whole gift and\nthe magic of a pause"},"1694":{"dur":1,"text":"is maybe being out\nof your comfort zone"},"1696":{"dur":1,"text":"and not controlling everything."},"1698":{"dur":3,"text":"Potentially it could be to let\nthe magic happen, as I say."},"1701":{"dur":4,"text":"Like being out of your\ncomfort zone is scary."},"1705":{"dur":3,"text":"And we have a lot of\nfear in our own heads"},"1708":{"dur":3,"text":"that prevent us from wanting to\ndo that based on just safety,"},"1712":{"dur":2,"text":"and the psychological\nsafety of wanting"},"1714":{"dur":1,"text":"to know what's comfortable."},"1716":{"dur":3,"text":"So when we start\nletting things just go,"},"1719":{"dur":2,"text":"we kind of want to go into a\npanic mode or change things."},"1722":{"dur":4,"text":"But in general, I'd say,\nwell, why not just be and not"},"1726":{"dur":1,"text":"have a big plan?"},"1728":{"dur":1,"text":"And if you set your\nintention and know"},"1729":{"dur":3,"text":"what you want out of it, I think\nthat's a really good way to go."},"1732":{"dur":4,"text":"Because you kind of have a\nguide that lay on the horizon,"},"1736":{"dur":2,"text":"but you don't have to have\nall the minutia steps."},"1739":{"dur":2,"text":"And then that's the routine that\nwe know, and where most of us"},"1742":{"dur":0,"text":"are used to."},"1743":{"dur":1,"text":"So you're going to really\nchange a whole bunch"},"1745":{"dur":1,"text":"if you're in that\nroutine and wanting"},"1747":{"dur":2,"text":"to stick to what you know."},"1749":{"dur":2,"text":"But I think it's a experiment."},"1751":{"dur":1,"text":"Good question."},"1753":{"dur":1,"text":"Yep?"},"1755":{"dur":2,"text":"AUDIENCE: You said that you\nwere working pretty hard putting"},"1758":{"dur":3,"text":"in all the efforts\nbefore you took a pause,"},"1761":{"dur":4,"text":"and after pause you\nsaid that you are happy"},"1766":{"dur":1,"text":"and you are satisfied."},"1767":{"dur":4,"text":"So what were the key things in\nyour day-to-day

out"},"1791":{"dur":3,"text":"of the system, which\nwas work at the time,"},"1795":{"dur":3,"text":"and allow my self\nsome new space."},"1799":{"dur":1,"text":"So I did

million,"},"2321":{"dur":3,"text":"or $1, or zero dollars, or\nall the time in the world,"},"2325":{"dur":3,"text":"or five seconds, the idea\nis that you can create"},"2329":{"dur":2,"text":"a plan that works for you."},"2331":{"dur":1,"text":"So the three levers are--"},"2333":{"dur":1,"text":"really the first one\nis money, finances."},"2335":{"dur":4,"text":"So if you wanted to\nreally dive in and take"},"2339":{"dur":4,"text":"this high-end type of pause,\nyou can, but you don't have to."},"2344":{"dur":3,"text":"And pausing isn't about luxury\nvacations, although it can be."},"2348":{"dur":1,"text":"But it allows you to\nthink about what could you"},"2350":{"dur":1,"text":"do based on your budget?"},"2352":{"dur":1,"text":"And I actually have\na whole worksheet"},"2353":{"dur":2,"text":"on this if you wanted to look\nat plugging in some numbers,"},"2356":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's on my site\nand in the book."},"2358":{"dur":6,"text":"And the next one is, we\ndid finances, so activity."},"2364":{"dur":1,"text":"So what do you want to do?"},"2366":{"dur":3,"text":"And pausing isn't about the\nquantity of time at all."},"2370":{"dur":2,"text":"If you've heard that 100\ntimes in different ways,"},"2372":{"dur":1,"text":"that's the case."},"2373":{"dur":2,"text":"Pausing about the\nquality of time,"},"2375":{"dur":2,"text":"and based on what\nyou'd want to do."},"2378":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is where you\nget to choose again"},"2380":{"dur":1,"text":"what you want to do."},"2381":{"dur":3,"text":"So it could be that\nwalk in the park."},"2384":{"dur":2,"text":"And ideally, you get out of\nyour comfort zone a little bit."},"2387":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe it's actually trying\nto meditate if you've never"},"2390":{"dur":2,"text":"tried it, and decided\nalways that you"},"2392":{"dur":1,"text":"don't have time for it."},"2394":{"dur":1,"text":"If you brought your\ngrowth mindset,"},"2396":{"dur":3,"text":"maybe this is a curious thing\nfor you, and you can shift."},"2399":{"dur":2,"text":"And we all have that power."},"2402":{"dur":2,"text":"And then the third one is time."},"2405":{"dur":1,"text":"So I talked a little\nbit about this,"},"2406":{"dur":2,"text":"but time is really irrelevant."},"2408":{"dur":1,"text":"It's about what works for you."},"2410":{"dur":2,"text":"So between those\nthree levers, everyone"},"2412":{"dur":1,"text":"can come up with\nwhat works for you."},"2414":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think journaling's\na great tool."},"2417":{"dur":1,"text":"It's also a way that\nyou can express,"},"2419":{"dur":2,"text":"and it also changes how\nyou think about ideas"},"2422":{"dur":1,"text":"when you put them on paper."},"2424":{"dur":3,"text":"There's research on that,\nand it's in the book."},"2428":{"dur":2,"text":"So journaling can be\npart of your pause plan."},"2430":{"dur":2,"text":"It can involve other people."},"2432":{"dur":1,"text":"And the idea is that--"},"2433":{"dur":2,"text":"how can you shift to lead\na more meaningful life?"},"2436":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's really\nthe name of the game."},"2438":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not to be a better pauser,\nalthough, that's probably"},"2441":{"dur":4,"text":"pretty nice, but it's really\nabout what can work for you."},"2446":{"dur":3,"text":"So I hope all of you can\nwalk out of this room"},"2450":{"dur":3,"text":"or in this discussion,\nand decide what you"},"2453":{"dur":1,"text":"could put into your pause

day"},"2536":{"dur":3,"text":"if you journal about an\nemotional experience--"},"2539":{"dur":2,"text":"so you write in a\nbook literally how"},"2541":{"dur":2,"text":"you felt about\nsomething that happened."},"2543":{"dur":4,"text":"There's research that\nshows that you actually"},"2548":{"dur":1,"text":"process that differently."},"2550":{"dur":3,"text":"And now it's escaping\nme, of course,"},"2554":{"dur":3,"text":"but it's actually leading\nto being more in touch"},"2557":{"dur":3,"text":"with your feelings and changing\nhow you feel about things."},"2560":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's a tool you\ncan use to harness"},"2563":{"dur":2,"text":"that emotional intelligence and\ncontinue to build that skill."},"2565":{"dur":1,"text":"But two minutes a day,\nand this study, I think,"},"2567":{"dur":1,"text":"was over a series of weeks."},"2569":{"dur":4,"text":"And the group that\nthey researched"},"2573":{"dur":1,"text":"found that they had--"},"2575":{"dur":4,"text":"I think it was-- a better sense\nof overall happiness, something"},"2580":{"dur":0,"text":"to that effect."},"2581":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm probably\nbutchering the study."},"2583":{"dur":1,"text":"But yeah, it was\ninteresting to me."},"2585":{"dur":2,"text":"Because two minutes\na day, I mean,"},"2588":{"dur":2,"text":"that's pretty easy to\ncome up with, right?"},"2590":{"dur":1,"text":"Whether it's in the\nmorning or night."},"2592":{"dur":1,"text":"And if you actually\ndid that about how"},"2594":{"dur":3,"text":"you felt about\nsomething, so like, oh,"},"2597":{"dur":2,"text":"such and such happened\nto me, and I felt--"},"2599":{"dur":1,"text":"and name an emotion."},"2600":{"dur":2,"text":"I felt happy, I\nfelt a lot of joy."},"2603":{"dur":1,"text":"It could be gratitude."},"2604":{"dur":4,"text":"But it might also be things that\nweren't so pleasant, like, sad,"},"2609":{"dur":2,"text":"or really frustrated and angry."},"2611":{"dur":1,"text":"And so the idea is\nthat you're activating"},"2613":{"dur":1,"text":"different parts of your\nbrain through writing,"},"2615":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's also activating\nyour emotional intelligence,"},"2617":{"dur":3,"text":"and therefore allowing yourself\nto increase that skill."},"2621":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's other\nresearch too about writing"},"2623":{"dur":2,"text":"and
