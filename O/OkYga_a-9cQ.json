actually doing."},"574":{"dur":7,"text":">> ELIZA is taking a sentence-- let's\nsay, \"I want to impress my boss.\""},"582":{"dur":3,"text":"And ELIZA is looking\nthrough that sentence"},"585":{"dur":3,"text":"and trying to find and\nmatch certain patterns."},"588":{"dur":4,"text":"So, for example, one of the patterns\nthat ELIZA is looking for are the words"},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"\"I want.\""},"595":{"dur":4,"text":"And any time it sees something\nthat has \"I want\" in it,"},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"it formulates a

to impress my boss,\""},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"there's a little bit of additional\nprocessing that we'll do."},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"That is, we'll have to\nconvert some of the pronouns"},"634":{"dur":4,"text":"here from \"my boss\" to \"your boss.\""},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"And there might be a few other\nchanges that we need to make."},"641":{"dur":3,"text":"So rather than just sticking it\ndirectly onto the end, what we'll do"},"644":{"dur":4,"text":"is we'll take the rest of the\nuser's utterance-- in white here--"},"649":{"dur":4,"text":"and we'll take it one piece at\na time and convert each string"},"654":{"dur":4,"text":"token, each word, into the sentence."},"658":{"dur":1,"text":">> So we'll take the word \"to.\""},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"There's no

\"your.\""},"666":{"dur":3,"text":"And \"boss\" we'll just leave as \"boss.\""},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"And then finally, anything\nthat ends with a period,"},"672":{"dur":3,"text":"we'll convert it into a question."},"676":{"dur":5,"text":">> This very simple pattern matching\nis actually quite successful."},"682":{"dur":4,"text":"And when this was introduced\nin 1966-- Joseph

resources."},"693":{"dur":5,"text":"And his students would\ngo and chat with ELIZA."},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"Eventually, he had to\nrestrict access to it"},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"because his students weren't\ngetting any work done."},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"They were just chatting with ELIZA."},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"And, in fact, he had to\nfire his assistant, who"},"708":{"dur":6,"text":"spent all of her time talking to ELIZA\nabout her deep and worrisome problems."},"715":{"dur":4,"text":">> Everyone who used these systems\nstarted to anthropomorphize them."},"720":{"dur":4,"text":"They started to think of them as\nbeing animate and real people."},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"They started to recognize some of\nthe things that they were saying"},"727":{"dur":1,"text":"were coming back to them."},"729":{"dur":3,"text":"And they were finding out\nthings about themselves."},"732":{"dur":5,"text":"And, in fact, even the experts,\neven the psychotherapists,"},"737":{"dur":5,"text":"started to worry that, in fact,\nmaybe ELIZA would be replacing them."},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"And even the computer\nscientists worried that we were"},"745":{"dur":4,"text":"so close to solving natural language."},"750":{"dur":3,"text":">> Now, that wasn't anywhere close to true."},"753":{"dur":3,"text":"But that's how impressive\nthese systems can seem."},"757":{"dur":2,"text":"So let's start to look\nunderneath and try"},"760":{"dur":6,"text":"to get a little bit of a question\nof where this code actually happens."},"766":{"dur":1,"text":"So we'll make this code\navailable afterwards."},"768":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is a very\nsimple and direct port"},"770":{"dur":2,"text":"of the original ELIZA implementation."},"773":{"dur":3,"text":">> So some of these stylistic\nthings that you'll see here"},"776":{"dur":3,"text":"are not stylistically what\nwe would want you to do"},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"or what we've been teaching you to do."},"781":{"dur":3,"text":"But we've tried to keep them\nthe same across the many ports"},"784":{"dur":3,"text":"that this has had so that it\nhas the flavor of the original."},"788":{"dur":1,"text":"So we're going to include\na bunch of things,"},"789":{"dur":3,"text":"and then we'll have a\nset of keywords, things"},"792":{"dur":3,"text":"that ELIZA will recognize\nand respond to directly."},"796":{"dur":4,"text":"So if you have words like\n\"can you\" or \"I don't\" or \"no\""},"800":{"dur":3,"text":"or \"yes\" or \"dream\"\nor \"hello,\" then ELIZA"},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"will respond selectively to those."},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"We'll also have a\ncertain number of things"},"810":{"dur":4,"text":"that we will swap, like\nconverting \"my\" to \"your.\""},"814":{"dur":4,"text":">> And then we'll have a set of responses\nthat for each of these keywords,"},"819":{"dur":2,"text":"we'll rotate through\nthese different responses."},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"So if I say \"yes\"\nthree times in a row, I"},"825":{"dur":5,"text":"might get three different\nresponses from ELIZA."},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"Our code, then, is\nactually remarkably simple."},"832":{"dur":7,"text":"If I scroll down past all of these\nresponses that we have programmed in"},"839":{"dur":3,"text":"and we get down to our main,\nwe're going to initialize"},"842":{"dur":3,"text":"a couple of different variables\nand do a little bit of housekeeping"},"846":{"dur":1,"text":"in the beginning."},"848":{"dur":3,"text":"But then there's absolutely a set\nof code that you can understand."},"851":{"dur":4,"text":"One big while loop that says I'm\ngoing to repeat this over and over."},"855":{"dur":4,"text":"I'll read in a line, and I'll\nstore that in an input string."},"860":{"dur":3,"text":"I'll check and see if it's the\nspecial keyword \"bye,\" which"},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"means exit the program."},"866":{"dur":3,"text":"And then I'll check and see whether\nsomebody is just repeating themselves"},"869":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'll yell at them if they do."},"871":{"dur":3,"text":"I'll say \"don't repeat yourself.\""},"874":{"dur":5,"text":">> As long as none of those happen, we'll\nthen scan through and loop through,"},"880":{"dur":4,"text":"on lines 308 to 313\nhere, and check and
