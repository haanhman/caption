{"0":{"dur":3,"text":"[MUSIC PLAYING]"},"14":{"dur":2,"text":"Our next session\nis about how to do"},"17":{"dur":1,"text":"all of that critical thinking."},"19":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm joined by Janette\nWallace in the studio."},"21":{"dur":1,"text":"Jeanette, welcome."},"22":{"dur":0,"text":"JANETTE WALLACE: Hello."},"23":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Thank\nyou very much."},"24":{"dur":1,"text":"I see you've brought some food."},"25":{"dur":1,"text":"JANETTE WALLACE: I\nhave brought some food."},"27":{"dur":2,"text":"I didn't realise there\nwere rules about the food."},"31":{"dur":2,"text":"Yes, I've brought\nsome chocolate brains."},"34":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Oh, thank you."},"35":{"dur":2,"text":"I've never been offered\nchocolate brains in the studio"},"38":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, that was very kind of you."},"40":{"dur":1,"text":"Excellent."},"41":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is a perfectly\nappropriate thing"},"43":{"dur":1,"text":"to eat during a critical\nthinking conversation."},"45":{"dur":1,"text":"JANETTE WALLACE: Yes."},"46":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Lovely."},"47":{"dur":0,"text":"Well, thank you."},"48":{"dur":2,"text":"We shall enjoy tucking\ninto those later."},"50":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, Janette has been an\nassociate, actually, or tutor"},"53":{"dur":2,"text":"with the Open University\nfor quite a number of years,"},"56":{"dur":2,"text":"And you teach in\nscience from level 1"},"59":{"dur":2,"text":"all the way up to Masters,\nwhich is quite interesting,"},"61":{"dur":2,"text":"because you're going to\nhave a very broad, I guess,"},"63":{"dur":2,"text":"perspective of what critical\nthinking is all about."},"66":{"dur":0,"text":"JANETTE WALLACE: Yep."},"67":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Hopefully."},"68":{"dur":1,"text":"So we're going to\ntalk about this."},"70":{"dur":3,"text":"And we're going to change\nthe widgets over now as well."},"73":{"dur":2,"text":"So we've just got one this time,\nwhich is about which technique"},"76":{"dur":2,"text":"you feel most confident\nin practicing."},"79":{"dur":2,"text":"So do you feel most\nconfident in the idea"},"81":{"dur":1,"text":"of-- whether you're\nstudying already"},"83":{"dur":1,"text":"or perhaps something\njust, theoretically, you"},"85":{"dur":3,"text":"might like to think about--\nusing content and examples,"},"88":{"dur":5,"text":"using themes, or doing things\nlike linking and signposting?"},"93":{"dur":2,"text":"So various different\ntechniques there that one"},"95":{"dur":2,"text":"can use when, in particular,\nwriting critically."},"98":{"dur":2,"text":"So we will focus a\nlittle bit about that."},"101":{"dur":2,"text":"So Janette, we've been\ntalking a little bit about,"},"103":{"dur":2,"text":"John was talking about,\nwhat critical thinking"},"105":{"dur":1,"text":"was all about."},"107":{"dur":2,"text":"And the key things\nthat he was mentioning"},"109":{"dur":2,"text":"was that it was different\nto criticising something."},"112":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's not just about saying,\nwell, it's no good or this,"},"114":{"dur":0,"text":"this, and this."},"115":{"dur":2,"text":"And he also said that it's\nvery important not to use"},"118":{"dur":1,"text":"your own voice in doing that."},"119":{"dur":1,"text":"So we're trying to\ndevelop, I guess,"},"120":{"dur":2,"text":"an academic argument as opposed\nto an individual perspective"},"123":{"dur":1,"text":"about how rubbish this,\nthat, or the other is."},"125":{"dur":3,"text":"He said that's definitely\nnot critical thinking."},"129":{"dur":2,"text":"We also mentioned that\nin terms of the grades,"},"131":{"dur":2,"text":"critical thinking can be really\nimportant, in particular,"},"133":{"dur":2,"text":"from distinguishing,\nsay, a B from an A."},"135":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's issues there\nin terms of marks,"},"138":{"dur":3,"text":"but also, he said that those\nare quite specific to levels."},"141":{"dur":2,"text":"So at level 1, you are often\ntrying to be descriptive,"},"144":{"dur":2,"text":"you are trying to outline\nthings, for example."},"146":{"dur":1,"text":"And then when you start\ngoing into level 2,"},"148":{"dur":1,"text":"you're then starting\nto, I guess,"},"149":{"dur":2,"text":"evaluate, compare,\nand contrast and use"},"152":{"dur":1,"text":"other sorts of words\nthat might indicate"},"154":{"dur":0,"text":"some critical thinking."},"155":{"dur":3,"text":"So where do you, as a tutor,\nsee that distinction in terms"},"158":{"dur":1,"text":"of your students' journey?"},"159":{"dur":2,"text":"When do they start getting\nthe hang of critical thinking?"},"162":{"dur":2,"text":"When does it start to matter?"},"164":{"dur":5,"text":"JANETTE WALLACE: In my\nexperience as a science tutor,"},"170":{"dur":2,"text":"they do start a\nlittle bit in level 1."},"172":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe not too much."},"173":{"dur":4,"text":"Oh, as an experience,\nyes, they would, perhaps,"},"178":{"dur":5,"text":"analyse a graph-- so something\nquite simple-- comment on it."},"183":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's not really\ncritical writing yet,"},"187":{"dur":2,"text":"but it might be just a few\ncomments about a graph."},"189":{"dur":2,"text":"It tends to be more\nbeginning in level 2,"},"192":{"dur":3,"text":"where they might be\nwriting an essay,"},"196":{"dur":2,"text":"where there needs to be\narguments or a claim put"},"199":{"dur":4,"text":"forward, and they need\nto start giving evidence"},"203":{"dur":2,"text":"to come alongside those\narguments and claims"},"206":{"dur":2,"text":"that they're writing about."},"208":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'd say, it\nbegins in level 1,"},"212":{"dur":3,"text":"and you start to think a bit\nmore critically as you're"},"215":{"dur":4,"text":"studying, and it becomes\nmore apparent as you're"},"219":{"dur":1,"text":"answering questions\nin level 2, I"},"221":{"dur":1,"text":"would say, in science, anyway."},"223":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Now, this\nis an interesting idea,"},"224":{"dur":4,"text":"because John said, there was\nthis idea of meta thinking,"},"229":{"dur":1,"text":"meta representing ideas."},"230":{"dur":2,"text":"So you're thinking about\nwhat you're thinking about,"},"232":{"dur":1,"text":"metacognition."},"233":{"dur":2,"text":"But are those students then, who\nhave started to pick up points"},"236":{"dur":2,"text":"of a graph, do they even\nrealise that they're critically"},"238":{"dur":0,"text":"thinking?"},"239":{"dur":1,"text":"JANETTE WALLACE:\nProbably not, no."},"241":{"dur":3,"text":"Maybe-- do we actually realise\nthat we're critically thinking"},"244":{"dur":2,"text":"all the time in our lives?"},"247":{"dur":4,"text":"Everyday activities that we\ndo, we're critically thinking."},"251":{"dur":5,"text":"So imagine, as I'm a tutor,\nI might be answering emails"},"256":{"dur":3,"text":"and I might get a request from\na student for an extension,"},"260":{"dur":2,"text":"So I get an email saying,\nI would like an extension."},"263":{"dur":1,"text":"In answering that\nemail, I'm actually"},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"going to be critically\nthinking about what"},"268":{"dur":2,"text":"So I will be looking\nat the student."},"271":{"dur":1,"text":"Have they had an\nextension before?"},"273":{"dur":1,"text":"What is the reason\nfor the extension?"},"274":{"dur":3,"text":"How long do they want?"},"278":{"dur":1,"text":"One day, two weeks."},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"And I will be evaluating\nthat information"},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"and coming up with a\ndecision or an opinion"},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"based on that to say, yes,\nyou can have an extension"},"287":{"dur":3,"text":"or, no, it's not a valid\nreason or whatever."},"291":{"dur":3,"text":"So even just doing a simple\nthing like answering an email,"},"294":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm critically evaluating\nthe information in there."},"297":{"dur":5,"text":"So it's everyday life, you will\nbe critically thinking anyway."},"302":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: OK."},"303":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, I know that the\nlibrary are coming"},"305":{"dur":2,"text":"to talk a little bit about some\nevaluation frameworks later"},"307":{"dur":1,"text":"and we've got these\nvarious ones that we use."},"309":{"dur":2,"text":"In particular, in science,\nwe use PROMPT frameworks"},"311":{"dur":1,"text":"and various things\nlike that to help,"},"313":{"dur":2,"text":"I guess, identify and\ncompare and contrast"},"315":{"dur":3,"text":"various aspects or certain\nareas around something"},"318":{"dur":0,"text":"that we're looking at."},"319":{"dur":2,"text":"How important then would you\nsay those frameworks are?"},"322":{"dur":0,"text":"Because what you're\ntalking about,"},"323":{"dur":1,"text":"I guess, is critical\nthinking in everyday life,"},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"the way that we think,\nwe appraise situations."},"327":{"dur":1,"text":"We're thinking\nbeings, so when does"},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"it become just normal thinking\nand critical thinking?"},"331":{"dur":1,"text":"How useful are\nframeworks in trying"},"333":{"dur":2,"text":"to get a grip on structuring\nsome of those thoughts?"},"336":{"dur":1,"text":"JANETTE WALLACE: I think\nthey're very useful."},"338":{"dur":1,"text":"You mentioned PROMPT."},"339":{"dur":1,"text":"In science, we use\nPROMPT quite a lot."},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a type of analysis."},"343":{"dur":4,"text":"PROMPT is an acronym and it\nstands for a variety of words."},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"And you look at it, well,\nnormally, in articles,"},"350":{"dur":1,"text":"say, in science,\nbut you can apply it"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"to a website, anything, really."},"353":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's just a method by which\nyou would look at information"},"358":{"dur":3,"text":"and note down different\naspects of it."},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"You could also create a table."},"363":{"dur":3,"text":"There is a table in\nthe critical thinking"},"367":{"dur":3,"text":"booklet that's on the\nSkills for Study website."},"370":{"dur":1,"text":"There's a table in\nthere where you,"},"372":{"dur":1,"text":"when you're looking\nat information,"},"373":{"dur":1,"text":"you would write a\ndescription and then you"},"375":{"dur":3,"text":"would look at any claims in it,\nany weaknesses or strengths."},"379":{"dur":3,"text":"And so you start noting\ndown what you are thinking,"},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"so that when it comes\nto answering a question,"},"384":{"dur":5,"text":"you can use that information\nto input into your answer."},"389":{"dur":3,"text":"So things like essays, you'd\nbe looking for arguments"},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"and you'd be looking for points\nof two sides of an argument,"},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"perhaps, and so you need\nto gather that information"},"398":{"dur":0,"text":"together."},"399":{"dur":2,"text":"And actually, they're\nuseful, those things."},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"But what I suggest\nto my students"},"405":{"dur":5,"text":"is to actually get a big\npiece of paper, for example,"},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"an old bit of\nwallpaper, the back"},"412":{"dur":3,"text":"of an old bit of wallpaper,\nand if you've got an essay,"},"415":{"dur":1,"text":"write the essay\nquestion in the middle."},"417":{"dur":2,"text":"And then if you've got\ncertain points or arguments"},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"you want to make, write\nthem down, and then"},"422":{"dur":3,"text":"gather information and add\nit to your bit of wallpaper"},"426":{"dur":1,"text":"and stick it on your wall."},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"And there you have your essay."},"430":{"dur":3,"text":"And what you do then is\nconstruct an essay from this."},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"It's sort of like a\nmind map, I guess,"},"435":{"dur":1,"text":"that you would talk about."},"436":{"dur":3,"text":"And then you would\nconstruct lots of arguments"},"439":{"dur":3,"text":"and write your essay based\non your bit of wallpaper"},"443":{"dur":1,"text":"that you've got on your wall."},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"So I often tell students,\nthink of things visually."},"447":{"dur":3,"text":"So record the information, but\nthen maybe record it visually,"},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"little diagrams and\nthings like that."},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"Because often,\nstudents don't just"},"454":{"dur":3,"text":"think-- they do think visually\nand it helps them a lot."},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Yeah,\nno, absolutely."},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"Last week, actually,\nwe had Nicky Harlow,"},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"who is an arts tutor,\nand she was talking to us"},"463":{"dur":0,"text":"about mind mapping."},"464":{"dur":0,"text":"JANETTE WALLACE: Oh, OK."},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: And what was\nreally interesting was"},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"she was saying, you can\nhave all of these ideas,"},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"but how many of these are\nreally relevant to the question?"},"471":{"dur":1,"text":"And we were starting\nto carve off there"},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"in the section that\nwas relevant and trying"},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"to stick tight and hold to that."},"477":{"dur":1,"text":"It's interesting, because\nwhen we asked people"},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"about techniques that they\nfelt confident about using,"},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"80% said using\ncontent and examples,"},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"they felt confident in\nusing those, whereas only 8%"},"488":{"dur":4,"text":"said using themes, and 11% said\nusing linking and signposting."},"492":{"dur":1,"text":"That's gone down\njust a little bit,"},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"actually, as the data\nhas been coming through."},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"But these are very interesting\nideas, aren't they?"},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"Because so often, we think\nthat critical thinking"},"500":{"dur":3,"text":"has to relate to content,\nand largely it does."},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"But the other two points\nabout using themes,"},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"which may be things\nthat, I guess,"},"508":{"dur":1,"text":"emerge from module materials."},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"They might be strands\nthat run through a course."},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"And also linking\nand signposting,"},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"a real sort of\nwriting technique."},"516":{"dur":4,"text":"Those techniques are also useful\nfor presenting a critical view"},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"on something as a tool."},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"But I guess, people aren't\nso confident using them,"},"525":{"dur":3,"text":"perhaps because we've got quite\na lot of level 1 students here."},"528":{"dur":4,"text":"So going back to the idea then\nof the sort of the 80% or 78%"},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"about using content\nand examples."},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"You've spoken about trying\nto break some of these things"},"537":{"dur":1,"text":"So we might use\nPROMPT or we might use"},"539":{"dur":1,"text":"a various sort of framework."},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"And you were saying to students,\nwrite them down, get things"},"543":{"dur":1,"text":"down."},"544":{"dur":2,"text":"Can students then think--\ndo you find that they think,"},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"oh, I don't know\nwhat headings to put."},"548":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'm fine filling in a\ntable, no problem at all."},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"But then what do I include?"},"552":{"dur":0,"text":"What don't I include?"},"553":{"dur":1,"text":"And if I-- I used to\nremember doing this."},"555":{"dur":3,"text":"If I don't include everything,\nwill I be missing a big bit?"},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"What would you say about just\ngetting on, and going for it,"},"561":{"dur":2,"text":"and trying to look at\nthings in that sort of way,"},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"no matter what framework\nyou've got to work with?"},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"JANETTE WALLACE: Well,\nthey need to just,"},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"like you say, get on with\nit, write the answer."},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"But the other thing that you\ncan do that many students"},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"don't even think\nabout is, actually,"},"574":{"dur":3,"text":"be critically thinking about the\nquestion and what it's asking,"},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"and actually spending time\nanalysing questions and what is"},"581":{"dur":4,"text":"it that the question's\nasking them to provide."},"585":{"dur":3,"text":"There are often a lot of\ninformation within a question"},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"giving you hints and\ntips and suggestions"},"591":{"dur":1,"text":"of where you might go."},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"But this is why sometimes\nyou go off on a tangent,"},"596":{"dur":1,"text":"because you write\nyour essay, you think,"},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"oh, I don't need to include\nall of this information."},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"It's about, say, depression,\nthe causes of depression."},"603":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to write\neverything that I know"},"605":{"dur":1,"text":"about the cause of depression."},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"But actually, you need to\ngo back to the question."},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"Perhaps the question only\nwanted to know about the biology"},"611":{"dur":0,"text":"of depression."},"612":{"dur":3,"text":"Perhaps it didn't want to know\nthe psychology of depression."},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"So being critical\nof the questions"},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"will help you in your\nassignment as well."},"620":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Excellent."},"621":{"dur":1,"text":"Brilliant point."},"622":{"dur":3,"text":"How do you then know when\nstudents are submitting"},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"an essay that's an A\nto a B when they're"},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"using that critical thought?"},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"When do you sit there\nand think, actually,"},"632":{"dur":3,"text":"this student is really applying\nsome of these critical thinking"},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"What signposts or\nwhat things do you"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"look for that would\nindicate that?"},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"JANETTE WALLACE:\nWell, it's really--"},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"you can tell from the\nwriting that there's"},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"a true understanding\nof the material."},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"So they haven't just\npassively read the material"},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"and noted down information."},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"they've actually\nlooked at the material,"},"653":{"dur":3,"text":"understood it, and developed\nan argument from it,"},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"so that they can--\nand you can see"},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"the argument in the writing."},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"They might, say, give\na point, and then they"},"663":{"dur":5,"text":"justify it with evidence that\nis good evidence from maybe"},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"the module material, not just\nfrom personal experience--"},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Very good point."},"673":{"dur":1,"text":"JANETTE WALLACE: --which\nis needed on, well,"},"674":{"dur":1,"text":"the science modules\nin particular."},"676":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: So\nthey've identified"},"677":{"dur":1,"text":"where the appropriate\nevidence is used"},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"and then they're making\nthe points in, I guess,"},"681":{"dur":1,"text":"an individual way."},"682":{"dur":1,"text":"So they're saying, well,\nI've read this here"},"684":{"dur":0,"text":"and there's this point."},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"And I guess, just that\nlinking of two things"},"687":{"dur":3,"text":"shows some aspect\nof criticality."},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"Ben, where's Annie gone?"},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"BEN: So HJ popped up in\nthe chat and mentioned"},"695":{"dur":0,"text":"he'd left his bag."},"696":{"dur":3,"text":"BEN: Yes, he is, but he seems\nto have left his bag somewhere,"},"699":{"dur":3,"text":"so Annie's going to have\nto try and find it for him."},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"Not really anything I\ncan see around here,"},"705":{"dur":1,"text":"but I'll try and have a look."},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: It's a\nlot tidier, actually,"},"708":{"dur":1,"text":"to be completely honest,\nsince he's not there."},"710":{"dur":3,"text":"BEN: Well, I don't want to\nsay anything bad about HJ."},"713":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: No,\ndon't, actually."},"714":{"dur":0,"text":"BEN: No offence, HJ."},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Don't say anything,\njust in case he's watching,"},"717":{"dur":1,"text":"because you never know."},"718":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes, he's making sure\nthat we're looking for it."},"720":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's a search party out to\nlook for his bag at the moment."},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's all good."},"725":{"dur":1,"text":"Chat room's going mad."},"726":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Yeah?"},"727":{"dur":1,"text":"BEN: Of course."},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"In terms of how they\nkind of structure,"},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"and they do a lot of visual\nkind of building together"},"733":{"dur":1,"text":"of all of their points\nfor their essays."},"735":{"dur":4,"text":"So Michael Hunter, for instance,\nloves the spider chart."},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Good."},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"BEN: And then we\nhave it down to using"},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"a combination of mind\nmaps and bullet points"},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"to try and picturise it as well."},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"There's also talk\nof referencing,"},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"and good referencing, bad\nreferencing, and where"},"753":{"dur":1,"text":"to go to find some references."},"754":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's a lot\nof people that had"},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"mentioned that Wikipedia isn't\nthe best idea to use that."},"759":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Ah, good."},"760":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, we'll listen to\nwhat the library have"},"762":{"dur":1,"text":"to say all about that later."},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"BEN: Yeah, which is great."},"766":{"dur":1,"text":"But yeah, overall,\neveryone's really"},"768":{"dur":2,"text":"engaged and loving the content."},"770":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Brilliant."},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"What are some of the questions\nabout referencing, Ben?"},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"Is there anything that\nwe need to clarify here"},"775":{"dur":1,"text":"before we go on?"},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"BEN: So it was really\njust about where"},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"is a good source, effectively."},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's where\nWikipedia then came from."},"784":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's really just\nfrom, I guess, my end,"},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"just making sure that you're\naware that the site you're"},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"looking at or the journal\nthat you're looking at"},"794":{"dur":3,"text":"is a relevant one to\nthe course, effectively."},"797":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Yeah."},"798":{"dur":1,"text":"That is such a brilliant point."},"800":{"dur":1,"text":"And of course, I'm glad to see\nsome people have been reading"},"801":{"dur":1,"text":"the programme, which I hope\nhas sort of sparked that up,"},"803":{"dur":2,"text":"because the library will, in\nfact, be talking about sources,"},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"and I guess, certain frameworks\nthat can be used to critically"},"808":{"dur":2,"text":"evaluate the extent to which one\nshould believe in some of those"},"811":{"dur":0,"text":"sources."},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"But Janette, what would you\nsay about students who think,"},"814":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going to be really critical,\nI'm going to go online,"},"817":{"dur":1,"text":"I might go into Wikipedia\nor Google Scholar,"},"819":{"dur":1,"text":"and I'm going to\nfind out everything"},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"there is to know that my\ntutor probably doesn't know,"},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"and then they'll think\nI'm being very critical."},"825":{"dur":1,"text":"What would you say\nabout, I guess,"},"827":{"dur":1,"text":"selecting the right material?"},"828":{"dur":3,"text":"And when do you know what\nis appropriate to include?"},"832":{"dur":2,"text":"JANETTE WALLACE: Well,\nwe never say, don't go"},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"outside
