ability"},"475":{"dur":5,"text":"to take money out of the company that they\nhave when they've gone public."},"481":{"dur":7,"text":"Our plan though is a little different because\nwe want to subject

there obviously are some gains that have\nalready been accrued where the stock price"},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"has gone up, before the reform takes effect,\nbut there's been no sale
