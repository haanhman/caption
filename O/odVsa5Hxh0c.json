extremely\nimpressive."},"671":{"dur":6,"text":"We can\u2019t really say anything negative in\nterms of their abilities because after taking"},"678":{"dur":5,"text":"some time to work with developers here and\naway, the best developers we\u2019ve worked with"},"683":{"dur":1,"text":"are from VirtualEmployee."},"684":{"dur":3,"text":"Shaun: What\u2019s impressed you most about the\ndevelopment work

really incredible\nthing about that is that a lot of this has"},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"never been done before."},"703":{"dur":5,"text":"The only reference point for the majority\nof this work was our own designs and they"},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"had to go based off of that."},"711":{"dur":5,"text":"They had to really get on the same page as\nus and that\u2019s important for any company"},"717":{"dur":7,"text":"or for any team is for everyone to be in one\naccord so that you can achieve the goals that"},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"you had in mind or the end product you had\nin mind."},"728":{"dur":5,"text":"They really had to work hard to understand\nhow we viewed not just the product but social"},"733":{"dur":7,"text":"networking and what we are trying to achieve\nfrom a standpoint of development."},"740":{"dur":5,"text":"So it required our development team to really\nrely on us and we in turn had to rely solely"},"746":{"dur":5,"text":"on our development team to bring this product\nto life."},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"It really brought us together."},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"Shaun: How do you work with your team in India?"},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"Ike: We rely heavily on Skype."},"760":{"dur":5,"text":"The day usually begins with a face-to-face\nmeeting and then messages back and forth through"},"766":{"dur":1,"text":"Skype in between those video calls."},"768":{"dur":5,"text":"At the beginning of the day, we might do a\ncall to discuss all the tasks for that day,"},"773":{"dur":4,"text":"and in between that time they might have received\na message that would brief them on everything"},"778":{"dur":4,"text":"that they would need to know before that call\nso we can have a productive conversation."},"783":{"dur":5,"text":"Once we finish that call, I remain available\nand if they have any questions or concerns,"},"789":{"dur":5,"text":"they can send me a message, and if it requires\na phone call or a conversation we take back"},"794":{"dur":4,"text":"to Skype, and then at the end of the day we\u2019ll\nshare a screen on Skype and they can show"},"798":{"dur":7,"text":"me the work that they\u2019ve done before I do\nany testing on my own end."},"806":{"dur":3,"text":"We spend a lot of time conversing back and\nforth."},"809":{"dur":5,"text":"At certain point in time, you want to have\na chance to not just discuss the work but"},"814":{"dur":3,"text":"the way that you want to approach the work."},"818":{"dur":5,"text":"Maybe we want to take things more slowly at\na certain point because we\u2019re not exactly"},"824":{"dur":6,"text":"sure what we were doing and we want to kind\nof build it and look at it and then at another"},"830":{"dur":4,"text":"point in time we have a really solid idea\nwhat we\u2019re doing and we want them to step"},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"on the gas pedal."},"837":{"dur":6,"text":"Again every time we meet up to have these\nconversations, they do really great job of"},"844":{"dur":5,"text":"picking up on what we\u2019re feeling and on\nwhat we need from them in terms of the way"},"849":{"dur":3,"text":"that we need them to approach the work and\nthey have always done a good job of responding"},"853":{"dur":1,"text":"to that."},"854":{"dur":6,"text":"Between that day and the next day, we rely\non emails so that they\u2019re briefed before"},"861":{"dur":4,"text":"the beginning of each shift as to what tasks\nthey will have in front of them, and what"},"865":{"dur":1,"text":"we need to talk about that day."},"867":{"dur":4,"text":"Shaun: Given how you work with your team in\nIndia, I know there\u2019s a lot of collaboration"},"871":{"dur":4,"text":"that you have with them, do you consider them\nto be colleagues, do you consider them as"},"876":{"dur":4,"text":"in-house staff or (indiscernible) [14:38]half\nway around the world?"},"880":{"dur":4,"text":"Ike: Well, actually I consider them to be\ncolleagues and in fact friends at this point."},"885":{"dur":2,"text":"We\u2019ve worked together for almost a year\nnow."},"887":{"dur":4,"text":"We do spend a lot of time also getting to\nknow each other and we\u2019ve formed somewhat"},"892":{"dur":2,"text":"of a personal relationship."},"894":{"dur":4,"text":"I really do appreciate their work and I let\nthem know as much as possible."},"898":{"dur":5,"text":"It\u2019s really hard to imagine not having them\nwith us at this point in time and I can honestly"},"904":{"dur":6,"text":"say when we first began outsourcing this work\nI did not expect to end up feeling that way."},"910":{"dur":7,"text":"But we don\u2019t really feel like we are outsourcing\nany work because they are dedicated to our"},"918":{"dur":7,"text":"company and they are dedicated to our tasks\nand we have never felt any conflicts of interest"},"925":{"dur":1,"text":"whatsoever."},"926":{"dur":8,"text":"There\u2019s something about having someone working\nwith you on a regular basis, seeing them everyday,"},"934":{"dur":4,"text":"having conversations with them every day,\nthere you start to feel a connection between"},"939":{"dur":2,"text":"yourself and that person."},"941":{"dur":5,"text":"So they are most definitely colleagues and\nfriends, they are people that we very much"},"947":{"dur":2,"text":"care about and we very much appreciate."},"950":{"dur":6,"text":"Shaun: So Ike, you actually opted for our\nteam model service over our dedicated employee"},"956":{"dur":1,"text":"option."},"957":{"dur":3,"text":"Some of our viewers might not know that we\nhave two different service models."},"961":{"dur":3,"text":"Why did you want to go down the team model\noption?"},"964":{"dur":5,"text":"Ike: For the same reason that I decided not\nto approach this project on my own."},"970":{"dur":4,"text":"When you\u2019re taking on something that you\nin a sense feel is bigger than yourself, you"},"975":{"dur":4,"text":"realize that two heads are better than one,\nnot just in terms of the amount of work that"},"980":{"dur":7,"text":"you can get done but these things can be mentally\ntaxing and emotionally taxing and at certain"},"987":{"dur":5,"text":"time you might need someone to pick you up,\nyou might need someone to be there with you,"},"993":{"dur":5,"text":"and we just wanted to expand upon that and\nmake sure that that component was there for"},"998":{"dur":3,"text":"the entire staff over the entire team."},"1001":{"dur":4,"text":"We saw the team model was a benefit and we\nweren\u2019t placing the responsibilities of"},"1006":{"dur":6,"text":"development on one person\u2019s shoulder, that\nwork could be shared and those people could"},"1012":{"dur":4,"text":"work together and share their concerns together."},"1016":{"dur":5,"text":"In a sense, their strength and unity in the\nnumbers that we have here and we wanted to"},"1022":{"dur":3,"text":"make sure that was extended to our development\nteam."},"1026":{"dur":5,"text":"By having a team of people working on the\nproject the knowledge

a"},"1047":{"dur":3,"text":"technical standpoint, which we might not be\nable to do as well."},"1051":{"dur":6,"text":"So it was key to have the team model available\nbecause of knowledge retention,

available."},"1066":{"dur":6,"text":"We wanted to be able to share the responsibilities\nof development of this project or development"},"1072":{"dur":6,"text":"of this product between more than one

you want to start with\ndifferent skillsets?"},"1089":{"dur":1,"text":"Why did you need that burden shared?"},"1091":{"dur":1,"text":"Could you share that with our
