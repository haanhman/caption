{"18":{"dur":0,"text":"We should start."},"19":{"dur":1,"text":"So thank you all for coming."},"20":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is, remarkably enough,\nweek 11 of this lecture series."},"25":{"dur":4,"text":"And we're very happy this week to have\nDaniel Humm from Eleven Madison Park."},"37":{"dur":1,"text":"Who will get to speak in a minute."},"39":{"dur":2,"text":"And he will give a lecture\ncalled Where is the Acid?"},"42":{"dur":2,"text":"But before he does that,\nyou have to put up with me."},"44":{"dur":3,"text":"So we have a fun game here\nin Science and Cooking."},"48":{"dur":1,"text":"We have a fun game in\nScience and Cooking."},"49":{"dur":1,"text":"We play this sometimes."},"51":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a parlor game."},"53":{"dur":1,"text":"We haven't marketed it yet."},"54":{"dur":1,"text":"No one to my knowledge has done it."},"56":{"dur":1,"text":"It's called Guess the Food."},"60":{"dur":2,"text":"So would anyone like to guess the food?"},"63":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes."},"64":{"dur":0,"text":"What?"},"65":{"dur":0,"text":"AUDIENCE: Peanut butter."},"66":{"dur":0,"text":"MICHAEL: Peanut butter."},"67":{"dur":1,"text":"Any other guesses?"},"68":{"dur":0,"text":"Yes, in the back?"},"69":{"dur":0,"text":"AUDIENCE: Chocolate."},"70":{"dur":1,"text":"MICHAEL: Chocolate."},"71":{"dur":0,"text":"Yes?"},"72":{"dur":1,"text":"AUDIENCE: Bone marrow."},"73":{"dur":1,"text":"MICHAEL: Bone marrow."},"74":{"dur":1,"text":"Actually bone marrow is the closest."},"76":{"dur":2,"text":"This is beef."},"78":{"dur":0,"text":"OK."},"80":{"dur":0,"text":"So guess the food."},"81":{"dur":1,"text":"Here's another one."},"82":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a good game, actually."},"87":{"dur":0,"text":"Does anybody-- yes."},"88":{"dur":1,"text":"AUDIENCE: Olive oil."},"89":{"dur":0,"text":"MICHAEL: Say again?"},"90":{"dur":0,"text":"AUDIENCE: Vegetable oil."},"91":{"dur":0,"text":"MICHAEL: Vegetable oil."},"92":{"dur":0,"text":"It's olive oil."},"93":{"dur":0,"text":"Very good."},"94":{"dur":2,"text":"So I mean, of course the way\nyou play the game of Guess"},"96":{"dur":3,"text":"the Food is that you all know that\nthere are major molecules of food."},"100":{"dur":0,"text":"There are fats."},"101":{"dur":1,"text":"There are carbohydrates."},"102":{"dur":1,"text":"There are proteins."},"103":{"dur":2,"text":"There's water, which is not\nlisted on the food label."},"106":{"dur":3,"text":"And if you look at those and you look at\nthe percentages of the various things,"},"109":{"dur":1,"text":"you can sort of guess the food."},"110":{"dur":3,"text":"So you guessed the vegetable oil instead\nof olive oil because it was all fats."},"114":{"dur":1,"text":"So what do you think it is?"},"115":{"dur":4,"text":"The question I want to raise is\nwhat else is important for food?"},"120":{"dur":2,"text":"That is, what else is important\nin a recipe other than this?"},"122":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean, look, if you have\na jar of water, right?"},"127":{"dur":6,"text":"The number of molecules per liter\nin that jar of water is enormous."},"133":{"dur":1,"text":"More than 10 to the 23."},"135":{"dur":5,"text":"There's about 10 to 25 molecules of\nwater that's in a liter of water."},"140":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a huge number."},"142":{"dur":3,"text":"But it turns out that--\nand this is the idea"},"146":{"dur":3,"text":"I want to leave you with before\nI turn this over Daniel--"},"149":{"dur":3,"text":"is that oftentimes there are\ningredients in a recipe which"},"153":{"dur":5,"text":"are very, very low concentrations, but\nyet are extremely important for taste."},"158":{"dur":4,"text":"And just to demonstrate this, here\nis a typical recipe for lemonade."},"163":{"dur":3,"text":"And the question is, what\nmakes it taste like lemonade?"},"166":{"dur":0,"text":"Yes."},"167":{"dur":0,"text":"AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]"},"168":{"dur":0,"text":"MICHAEL: The acid."},"169":{"dur":1,"text":"That was in the title of the lectures."},"171":{"dur":2,"text":"And where is the acid?"},"173":{"dur":1,"text":"The acid is in the lemons."},"175":{"dur":0,"text":"Very good."},"176":{"dur":3,"text":"So in fact, the acid that's in\nthe lemons is called citric acid."},"179":{"dur":1,"text":"Here is a picture of it."},"181":{"dur":3,"text":"And the citric acid is this complicated\nformula, this chemical formula."},"185":{"dur":4,"text":"And the main point of it is\nthat acid is something that"},"189":{"dur":2,"text":"more easily loses protons to water."},"192":{"dur":6,"text":"So an acid releases protons, which\nare H pluses, which go into water."},"198":{"dur":4,"text":"So even water, there are\nprotons that are in water--"},"203":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean in the form of hydronium ions."},"205":{"dur":4,"text":"And the concentration of them\nis one part in 10 to the seven"},"209":{"dur":5,"text":"of the moles per liter, which\nis more than 1 10 millionth."},"215":{"dur":1,"text":"It's actually more than that."},"216":{"dur":5,"text":"It's like, 1 over 550 millionth\nof the molecules that are in water"},"222":{"dur":1,"text":"are these protons."},"223":{"dur":3,"text":"But yet they are critically\nimportant for taste."},"227":{"dur":3,"text":"This is what I want to tell you, that\neven though there's so few of them,"},"230":{"dur":2,"text":"they are critically important for taste."},"232":{"dur":5,"text":"And when you see Chef Daniel do magical\nthings with acids, then in fact,"},"238":{"dur":4,"text":"he's adding so few protons\nthat if all of you in this room"},"242":{"dur":5,"text":"were water molecules, there wouldn't\nbe one of you is a proton in the dish"},"248":{"dur":0,"text":"that he makes."},"249":{"dur":1,"text":"They're just so few."},"250":{"dur":2,"text":"But yet they're critically\nimportant for taste."},"252":{"dur":5,"text":"And you can control them by playing with\nthings that Chef Daniel will play with."},"258":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was going to turn\nit over to Chef Daniel."},"260":{"dur":2,"text":"[APPLAUSE]"},"271":{"dur":2,"text":"Thank you, Michael."},"273":{"dur":0,"text":"How are you guys?"},"274":{"dur":0,"text":"AUDIENCE: Good."},"277":{"dur":1,"text":"DANIEL HUMM: Hey, thank\nyou so much for coming."},"282":{"dur":3,"text":"Thank you for having me here."},"285":{"dur":1,"text":"It means a lot."},"286":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a great honor to\nbe part of this program."},"290":{"dur":5,"text":"And I'm excited to talk a little\nbit about myself, my story,"},"296":{"dur":3,"text":"the story of Eleven Madison Park."},"299":{"dur":6,"text":"And a few things that I've learned\nalong the way in the kitchen."},"306":{"dur":6,"text":"But before I start I have\na confession to make."},"312":{"dur":3,"text":"Me, I never finished high school."},"315":{"dur":4,"text":"In fact, I hated going to school."},"320":{"dur":4,"text":"I hated going to classes\nand studying things"},"324":{"dur":3,"text":"I knew I probably never going to use."},"328":{"dur":7,"text":"When I was 14 I left\nschool to be a cook."},"335":{"dur":7,"text":"Obviously, that was not a very\npopular decision with my parents."},"343":{"dur":5,"text":"But it's been the best\nthing I ever done."},"349":{"dur":8,"text":"The things that the path of cooking has\nopened me to-- it's been unbelievable."},"357":{"dur":4,"text":"The people I've met along the way."},"362":{"dur":7,"text":"I've traveled the world, learned about\ndifferent foods and different cultures."},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"I learned languages."},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"The opportunities just\nhave been unbelievable."},"377":{"dur":7,"text":"Eight years ago I came to this\ncountry with two suitcases mostly full"},"384":{"dur":6,"text":"of chef clothes, cookbooks, some knives."},"390":{"dur":3,"text":"I had a couple hundred dollars."},"394":{"dur":3,"text":"I did not speak English."},"398":{"dur":5,"text":"Now I'm here speaking in\nfront of you at Harvard."},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"That's insane."},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"[APPLAUSE]"},"415":{"dur":3,"text":"DANIEL HUMM: This is one of the best\nschools in the world, maybe the best"},"418":{"dur":1,"text":"school in the world."},"419":{"dur":3,"text":"This is the American dream."},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"When they first asked\nme to speak here, I"},"427":{"dur":7,"text":"wasn't sure if I'm the right candidate\nbecause I'm not a public speaker."},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"This is totally out of my comfort zone."},"437":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm nervous standing up here."},"441":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm a cook."},"442":{"dur":4,"text":"The place where I feel\ncomfortable is the kitchen."},"446":{"dur":6,"text":"But as I thought a little bit\nmore about the opportunity,"},"452":{"dur":4,"text":"I knew that there are definitely\nthings I have to share."},"457":{"dur":4,"text":"It's amazing how food has\nchanged over the past few years."},"462":{"dur":6,"text":"Now everyone in the world wants to know\nabout food, chefs, and restaurants."},"468":{"dur":5,"text":"When I started 25 years ago,\nthere was no food and science"},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"program at Harvard, or at any school."},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"There was no Food Network."},"481":{"dur":6,"text":"There weren't all of these TV\nshows, all these magazines."},"488":{"dur":3,"text":"For sure, there were no celebrity chefs."},"492":{"dur":5,"text":"Back then it was just\nabout the craft of cooking."},"497":{"dur":6,"text":"I fell in love with it because I\nlove the energy in the kitchen."},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"I love to work with fresh ingredients."},"507":{"dur":3,"text":"I love to work with my hands,\ncreate something with my hands."},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"Cooking is very tangible."},"517":{"dur":3,"text":"Something my dad always\nused to say, he said,"},"521":{"dur":7,"text":"it doesn't matter when you're passionate\nabout something how big or small it is."},"528":{"dur":4,"text":"The only thing that\nmatters is how much effort"},"532":{"dur":3,"text":"you're willing to put towards that."},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's what's\ncooking has been for me."},"539":{"dur":3,"text":"And that is what Eleven\nMadison Park represents today."},"547":{"dur":4,"text":"I have this clicker here in my hand,\nbeen holding it really awkwardly."},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"I've never used one of those."},"554":{"dur":3,"text":"So I just gonna give it to Mike."},"564":{"dur":4,"text":"To put something together like\nthis, or to do anything great,"},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"it always takes a team."},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"And I want to say thank\nyou to a few people"},"574":{"dur":3,"text":"that help have helped a lot with this."},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"I want to say thank you to Mike Pyers."},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"I want to say thank you to Connie Chung."},"583":{"dur":3,"text":"Both of them are chefs\nat our restaurant,"},"586":{"dur":4,"text":"and are in charge of all the\nresearch and development."},"591":{"dur":3,"text":"I want to say thank you\nto Aaron Ginsberg, who is"},"594":{"dur":4,"text":"our director for strategic development."},"599":{"dur":9,"text":"And he has spent hours with me\npracticing this, literally hours."},"611":{"dur":5,"text":"I wanna say thank you to [? Ali ?]\n[?

want to say thank you to\nmy business partner, Will Guidara,"},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"and my best friend."},"634":{"dur":1,"text":"I want to say thank you to a few things."},"636":{"dur":5,"text":"On one side, I want to say thank you\nto create the culture of hospitality"},"642":{"dur":6,"text":"and service that has set new\nstandards in our industry,"},"648":{"dur":7,"text":"because we can talk about food\nand work our time in the kitchen,"},"655":{"dur":6,"text":"but if the hospitality and the\nservice sucks, it all doesn't matter."},"661":{"dur":1,"text":"So thank you for that."},"662":{"dur":8,"text":"In addition, I want to say thank you for\nsupporting me, teaching me, pushing me"},"670":{"dur":5,"text":"to do things I never thought I could."},"676":{"dur":3,"text":"I also want to say thank\nyou to my girlfriend, Cara,"},"680":{"dur":3,"text":"and her mom, who are both here today."},"683":{"dur":5,"text":"Because we can have all the\nsupport professionally and at work,"},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"but you also need the support at home."},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"So please give a hand of\napplause to all of them."},"694":{"dur":3,"text":"[APPLAUSE]"},"705":{"dur":4,"text":"So let me give you a little\ncontext about the restaurant."},"709":{"dur":4,"text":"Eleven Madison Park is in\nthe heart of Manhattan."},"714":{"dur":3,"text":"It's on Madison Avenue and 24th Street."},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"It's in a beautiful art deco building."},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"The building is occupying\nan entire city block."},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact, the building\nwas supposed to become"},"727":{"dur":5,"text":"the tallest building in the\nworld, when it was built in 1928."},"732":{"dur":3,"text":"But due to the Great Depression,\nthe build was halted."},"735":{"dur":4,"text":"But what we ended up with is\nthis incredible dining room."},"740":{"dur":5,"text":"30-foot tall ceilings,\nhuge windows overlooking"},"745":{"dur":5,"text":"Madison Square Park, one of the\nmost beautiful parks in New York."},"750":{"dur":4,"text":"You even can see the Flatiron Building."},"755":{"dur":7,"text":"Imagine this dining room was supposed\nto be the lobby of the tallest"},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"building in the world."},"764":{"dur":5,"text":"There is no other restaurant\nwith a better view than ours."},"770":{"dur":3,"text":"It's such a New York space,\nsuch a New York room."},"773":{"dur":5,"text":"So it's important that through the\nexperience we pay homage to our food"},"779":{"dur":6,"text":"and through the delivery of\nthe food to the place we're in."},"785":{"dur":7,"text":"Our inspiration comes from fishermen,\nfarmers, artisans all around New York."},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"What people don't\nrealize when they think"},"798":{"dur":6,"text":"about New York-- all they think of is\nManhattan and this concrete jungle."},"804":{"dur":2,"text":"But we're on the Atlantic\ncoast, which is one"},"807":{"dur":4,"text":"of the most amazing waters for seafood."},"811":{"dur":3,"text":"Also, when you drive just\na half an hour north,"},"815":{"dur":4,"text":"you reach farmland for hours\nand hours and miles and miles."},"822":{"dur":5,"text":"The Hudson Valley, the Finger Lakes\nhave some of the most amazing conditions"},"827":{"dur":4,"text":"for agriculture, because of its\nsoil, the surrounding waters,"},"832":{"dur":2,"text":"and its amazing climate."},"834":{"dur":4,"text":"But in addition what we\nhave, we have New York City."},"839":{"dur":2,"text":"Hundreds of years of history."},"841":{"dur":5,"text":"Immigrants from all over the\nworld came to settle this place."},"846":{"dur":2,"text":"They all brought food traditions."},"849":{"dur":5,"text":"These traditions have evolved, and\nnew traditions have been created."},"858":{"dur":4,"text":"Eating at Eleven Madison\nPark is the intersection--"},"862":{"dur":6,"text":"I can hear my business partner,\nWill, laugh through the [INAUDIBLE]."},"869":{"dur":6,"text":"It's the intersection between, on one\nside we have these amazing ingredients,"},"875":{"dur":2,"text":"the amazing agriculture,\nand on the other side"},"878":{"dur":8,"text":"we have this rich history and culture\nof New York, the place that is our home."},"887":{"dur":3,"text":"But that's not why I am here today."},"890":{"dur":5,"text":"I'm here to talk about\nacid, and acids in food."},"896":{"dur":3,"text":"Where is the acid?"},"899":{"dur":4,"text":"My staff hears me say this more\nthan they probably care to remember."},"904":{"dur":5,"text":"But where is the acid is\nreally the central question"},"909":{"dur":3,"text":"when we create a new dish."},"913":{"dur":6,"text":"When seasoning foods,\neveryone talks about salt."},"919":{"dur":6,"text":"I believe acid is just as important--\nmaybe more important-- than salt."},"925":{"dur":5,"text":"When I grew up in Switzerland, I\nwas always drawn to acidic foods."},"931":{"dur":1,"text":"I love tomatoes."},"933":{"dur":1,"text":"I love citrus fruits."},"934":{"dur":2,"text":"I love pickles."},"936":{"dur":6,"text":"My mom's cooking-- sauerkraut, roasted\nchicken with lemon and rosemary."},"942":{"dur":6,"text":"She made a braised rabbit with\nolives, orange, and pickled onions."},"948":{"dur":4,"text":"I never knew exactly why I\nwas drawn to these dishes"},"953":{"dur":2,"text":"so much, why they were my favorite."},"956":{"dur":2,"text":"But looking back it makes\nsense, because there"},"958":{"dur":6,"text":"was presence of acid, which gave it\nbalance, and it highlighted the food."},"969":{"dur":4,"text":"At Eleven Madison Park, why\ndoes this matter so much?"},"973":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, I think acid\ncatches your attention."},"979":{"dur":5,"text":"I think when you taste acid,\nit kind of wakes you up."},"985":{"dur":1,"text":"And it just makes food better."},"986":{"dur":2,"text":"Acid just makes food better."},"989":{"dur":4,"text":"At Eleven Madison we serve tasting\nmenus-- 14, 15, 16 courses."},"994":{"dur":4,"text":"It's important that all\nthese dishes have acid."},"998":{"dur":3,"text":"We use acid from so\nmany different sources."},"1002":{"dur":3,"text":"But it keeps the guest excited."},"1006":{"dur":2,"text":"It keeps the meal lighter."},"1009":{"dur":3,"text":"And it makes the guest want more."},"1013":{"dur":4,"text":"Our food is different than, let's\nsay, traditional French food,"},"1017":{"dur":3,"text":"where it relies heavily\non butter, cream, and fat."},"1023":{"dur":3,"text":"Until a few years ago, we\nnever really thought too much"},"1027":{"dur":2,"text":"about the amounts of acid we were using."},"1030":{"dur":2,"text":"But then we started kind\nof digging into our food"},"1032":{"dur":3,"text":"and trying to understand\nour food a little bit more."},"1036":{"dur":7,"text":"And we realized that the acid is\nthe foundation of our cuisine."},"1044":{"dur":6,"text":"And as we dug even deeper,\nwe realized that acid"},"1050":{"dur":2,"text":"was doing so many other things."},"1053":{"dur":5,"text":"And these three things I\nwant to tell you today about."},"1058":{"dur":5,"text":"Number one, acid affects\nthe flavor in food."},"1063":{"dur":5,"text":"Number two, acid affects\nthe structure in food."},"1068":{"dur":4,"text":"And number three, we use\nacid to preserve food."},"1077":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's get into flavor."},"1080":{"dur":3,"text":"Obviously flavor comes first."},"1083":{"dur":2,"text":"It's the most important to us."},"1085":{"dur":1,"text":"We want the food to be delicious."},"1089":{"dur":7,"text":"When we add acid to food, it changes\nhow you perceive the other basic tastes."},"1097":{"dur":6,"text":"It interacts with the saltiness, the\nsweetness, with umami, and with bitter."},"1104":{"dur":4,"text":"A great example for this-- and\nI'm sure you've all seen it--"},"1108":{"dur":5,"text":"but sometimes you get an\nespresso with a slice of lemon."},"1114":{"dur":5,"text":"That lemon is there to squeeze\nlemon juice in the espresso."},"1119":{"dur":4,"text":"What it does, you add\nsour to the bitter."},"1123":{"dur":5,"text":"And it makes you perceive\nthe bitter as less bitter."},"1129":{"dur":4,"text":"Thankfully, coffee has gotten\na lot better over the years,"},"1134":{"dur":2,"text":"so you don't see that that much anymore."},"1136":{"dur":3,"text":"But that was the reason why."},"1139":{"dur":4,"text":"We also looked at some\nmanufactured foods."},"1144":{"dur":4,"text":"Coca-Cola, soy sauce, ketchup."},"1148":{"dur":6,"text":"All of these rely heavily on\nacid for the same reason--"},"1155":{"dur":2,"text":"it balances the sugar, the saltiness."},"1158":{"dur":2,"text":"But here is something else."},"1160":{"dur":8,"text":"It also makes food have\na better shelf life."},"1169":{"dur":5,"text":"These ingredients sometimes sit\non the shelf for two, three years."},"1175":{"dur":1,"text":"Really, two, three years."},"1177":{"dur":4,"text":"And you taste it, and you still\nsort of feel like they're fresh."},"1185":{"dur":3,"text":"Acid also affects the aroma in food."},"1188":{"dur":4,"text":"And that is really important\nfor us in the kitchen."},"1192":{"dur":1,"text":"We play with this all the time."},"1194":{"dur":5,"text":"Let's say we make a lemon sorbet."},"1200":{"dur":6,"text":"Let's say we make a lemon\nsorbet just using lemon juice."},"1206":{"dur":4,"text":"That's like every lemon\nsorbet that's out there."},"1210":{"dur":0,"text":"It's good."},"1211":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a good lemon sorbet."},"1213":{"dur":4,"text":"But let's say we also introduce\naroma to this lemon sorbet."},"1217":{"dur":6,"text":"And the way we do it, the sugar that\nis required to make that sorbet,"},"1224":{"dur":5,"text":"we take sugar cubes and we rub it on the\nskin of those lemons, and then season"},"1230":{"dur":1,"text":"the sorbet with that."},"1232":{"dur":3,"text":"So now we're also introducing aroma."},"1235":{"dur":4,"text":"And now when you taste that lemon\nsorbet, you smell that lemon sorbet,"},"1239":{"dur":4,"text":"and it elevates the\nflavor of that sorbet."},"1244":{"dur":2,"text":"The same thing happens\nwhen you peel a grapefruit."},"1246":{"dur":5,"text":"I'm sure you've all peeled\ngrapefruit before, before you eat it."},"1252":{"dur":4,"text":"When you peel it, the aromas,\nthe oils, they're on your hands."},"1256":{"dur":3,"text":"They hit your nose."},"1260":{"dur":5,"text":"And by the time you eat that\ngrapefruit, it tastes unbelievable."},"1265":{"dur":2,"text":"The best grapefruit you ever had."},"1267":{"dur":5,"text":"It tastes much better than a\ngrapefruit you would just get served"},"1272":{"dur":1,"text":"on a plate that's been pre-sliced."},"1277":{"dur":4,"text":"In cocktails we use it a lot."},"1281":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're at the bar,\nand you're ordering"},"1284":{"dur":5,"text":"a Manhattan-- I don't know if you're\nold enough, everyone in here--"},"1290":{"dur":4,"text":"but if you have a\nManhattan, the bartender,"},"1295":{"dur":6,"text":"at the very end of serving you\nthat drink, adds a twist of orange."},"1301":{"dur":3,"text":"That twist of orange,\nthat aroma hits your nose,"},"1305":{"dur":5,"text":"it elevates the flavor of that drink."},"1311":{"dur":3,"text":"All these things happen\nbecause your brain"},"1314":{"dur":7,"text":"is making a connection between\nwhat it tastes and what it smells."},"1324":{"dur":5,"text":"It elevates the experience."},"1329":{"dur":3,"text":"It's like going from\nblack and white to color."},"1337":{"dur":2,"text":"We have some bags here for you."},"1340":{"dur":4,"text":"And I'm sorry, Michael,\nyou know, we weren't"},"1344":{"dur":1,"text":"quite as prepared as I wanted to."},"1346":{"dur":4,"text":"But we disturbed your talk a\nlittle bit to bring in these bags."},"1350":{"dur":1,"text":"But here you have it."},"1352":{"dur":2,"text":"Please grab in these bags."},"1354":{"dur":1,"text":"There are two small bottles."},"1356":{"dur":4,"text":"I want you just take out\nthe two small bottles."},"1361":{"dur":0,"text":"OK."},"1364":{"dur":1,"text":"And now put the bag back down."},"1373":{"dur":3,"text":"We're gonna taste these."},"1376":{"dur":1,"text":"I would like to taste these as well."},"1382":{"dur":0,"text":"Thank you."},"1386":{"dur":3,"text":"In these two bottles we have soda."},"1389":{"dur":4,"text":"We've made a lot of different\nsodas over the years."},"1394":{"dur":5,"text":"Celery soda, cherry soda,\ncoffee soda, strawberry soda."},"1399":{"dur":6,"text":"But for here for you\ntoday, we have maple soda."},"1406":{"dur":4,"text":"I want to taste the first one\nwithout the sticker on it."},"1430":{"dur":2,"text":"It definitely tastes like maple syrup."},"1436":{"dur":3,"text":"But it tastes really sweet also."},"1439":{"dur":4,"text":"In fact, it's good, but I wouldn't\nreally want to drink this

drink good quality wine."},"3041":{"dur":3,"text":"There is a common theme."},"3045":{"dur":6,"text":"Manufactured foods add acid\nto make bad food taste better."},"3052":{"dur":10,"text":"The wine industry takes this really\nsweet, high alcoholic, bad grape juice,"},"3062":{"dur":4,"text":"they add acid, and they can sell it."},"3070":{"dur":6,"text":"If we take that knowledge and we add\nit to the best ingredients we have,"},"3076":{"dur":7,"text":"and we use it carefully, we can make\nfood from great to unbelievable."},"3087":{"dur":3,"text":"It affects all levels of food."},"3091":{"dur":5,"text":"On every level, acid changes\nand highlights the ingredients."},"3099":{"dur":2,"text":"So I've been talking a lot."},"3105":{"dur":3,"text":"But I want to talk about one more dish."},"3108":{"dur":3,"text":"And this dish I'm really excited about."},"3112":{"dur":2,"text":"This is a dish that we\nserve at the restaurant."},"3114":{"dur":2,"text":"We've been serving it for a long time."},"3117":{"dur":6,"text":"It's a dish that a lot of people\ntalk about, and people really love."},"3124":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a dish of carrot tartare."},"3127":{"dur":5,"text":"This dish is inspired by a\nclassic New York steak tartare."},"3132":{"dur":2,"text":"And we worked on this idea for a while."},"3138":{"dur":1,"text":"This is what we came up with."},"3140":{"dur":3,"text":"Also, I think it's what\nwe talked about earlier,"},"3143":{"dur":3,"text":"the intersection between\ngreat ingredients"},"3147":{"dur":1,"text":"and the history of New York."},"3149":{"dur":3,"text":"I think it's demonstrated\nin this dish really well."},"3153":{"dur":3,"text":"We have these amazing carrots\nfrom upstate New York,"},"3156":{"dur":2,"text":"from the Hudson Valley."},"3159":{"dur":3,"text":"We get it from a farm, his\nname is Alex [INAUDIBLE]."},"3163":{"dur":3,"text":"This guy's been growing\ncarrots for the last 40 years."},"3167":{"dur":3,"text":"He grows about 40\ndifferent types of carrots."},"3170":{"dur":4,"text":"These are the best carrots\nI have ever tasted."},"3175":{"dur":3,"text":"We wanted to make them\nthe star of this dish."},"3178":{"dur":5,"text":"And the way we serve it, we bring out\nthis meat grinder into the dining room,"},"3184":{"dur":4,"text":"and we clamp it on to the table."},"3188":{"dur":4,"text":"At this point the guests don't\nreally know what to expect."},"3192":{"dur":3,"text":"They expect to be meat."},"3195":{"dur":4,"text":"But then we come out with\nthese amazing carrots."},"3200":{"dur":3,"text":"And in this dish we\ndemonstrate all three things"},"3203":{"dur":1,"text":"that we talked about today."},"3205":{"dur":4,"text":"In this dish, acid affects\nthe flavor in food."},"3210":{"dur":5,"text":"In this dish, acid affects\nthe structure in the food."},"3215":{"dur":4,"text":"And also, we're using\nacid to preserve food."},"3220":{"dur":6,"text":"So the cook comes out and grinds these\ncarrots table side into that board."},"3227":{"dur":6,"text":"And on that pallet of ingredients, we\nask our guests to be their own chefs,"},"3233":{"dur":5,"text":"and add these ingredients to\ntheir liking, and mix it together."},"3239":{"dur":5,"text":"We have a marinated egg yolk--\nwhat we talked about earlier."},"3245":{"dur":3,"text":"We have pickled mustard seeds."},"3248":{"dur":3,"text":"We have compressed apples."},"3252":{"dur":3,"text":"We have a mustard of apple."},"3255":{"dur":2,"text":"And we have a carrot vinaigrette."},"3258":{"dur":6,"text":"And now, in your bag, there's a\njar with this dish already mixed."},"3265":{"dur":4,"text":"We also have a little\nbag of some rye crackers."},"3270":{"dur":2,"text":"You can dip them in."},"3272":{"dur":6,"text":"I would have loved to bring like,\n300 meat grinders and make that dish"},"3279":{"dur":2,"text":"for you, but I couldn't."},"3282":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is already mixed."},"3284":{"dur":3,"text":"And please taste it."},"3287":{"dur":2,"text":"Acid is so important in this dish."},"3289":{"dur":3,"text":"You can taste it."},"3292":{"dur":6,"text":"And acid in a way, it's such\na simple thing, adding acid."},"3299":{"dur":6,"text":"But then also acid does so many\ncomplicated things that we didn't know,"},"3306":{"dur":1,"text":"and we simply took for granted."},"3310":{"dur":4,"text":"There is one more thing\nin that bag for you."},"3315":{"dur":6,"text":"And everyone, anyone who leaves\na restaurant at Eleven Madison"},"3321":{"dur":4,"text":"leaves with a jar of granola."},"3325":{"dur":2,"text":"The granola has nothing to do with acid."},"3330":{"dur":3,"text":"But we're also in the\nhospitality business."},"3334":{"dur":7,"text":"And we just wanted you to\nhave a delicious breakfast."},"3341":{"dur":2,"text":"Thank you guys."}}
