that"},"149":{"dur":2,"text":"will go a little\nbit further and will"},"151":{"dur":2,"text":"take care of some additional\nconfiguration for you."},"154":{"dur":2,"text":"Whereas site-wide SEO\nis the kind of thing"},"157":{"dur":2,"text":"that you'll set up once and\nthen you can pretty much forget"},"159":{"dur":2,"text":"about it, per-post SEO\nis the kind of

that\nmight be in that post."},"185":{"dur":3,"text":"So that might be the\nmeta description, the alt"},"188":{"dur":2,"text":"text of the images\nthat you're using,"},"190":{"dur":3,"text":"and anything else\nthat might crop up."},"193":{"dur":2,"text":"If you do those three\nthings, then you're"},"196":{"dur":2,"text":"doing most of the\nwork to making sure"},"198":{"dur":2,"text":"that your posts are going to\nbe picked up by search engines."},"200":{"dur":1,"text":"If you want to take this\na little bit further,"},"202":{"dur":3,"text":"then there are additional little\ntechniques

do."},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"For example, don't try and\nthink that you're smarter"},"264":{"dur":1,"text":"than the search engines."},"266":{"dur":3,"text":"If you found a trick that gets\nyou top of the search results,"},"269":{"dur":3,"text":"then the bear in mind that it\nmight be something that Google"},"273":{"dur":1,"text":"will crack down on later."},"275":{"dur":1,"text":"So don't try to
