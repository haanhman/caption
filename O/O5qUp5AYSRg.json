what\nhappened, what did happen in Washington State."},"91":{"dur":2,"text":"Mark: So this is just a case where the hemperor\nhad no clothes."},"93":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: But yes."},"94":{"dur":1,"text":"Not even a hemp garment."},"95":{"dur":1,"text":"Mark: Not even a hemp garment, no."},"96":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: Okay."},"97":{"dur":3,"text":"So speaking of marijuana,

it."},"127":{"dur":1,"text":"Mark: Right."},"128":{"dur":6,"text":"So the main active agent in cannabis...I decided\nto stop saying marijuana, which was, after"},"134":{"dur":5,"text":"all, a bit of

term."},"147":{"dur":3,"text":"So the main active agent in cannabis is Delta\n9-THC."},"150":{"dur":6,"text":"And, I mean, there...One of the interesting\nthings about cannabis as a drug problem is"},"157":{"dur":6,"text":"that, unlike alcohol where there's a single\nmolecule you're interested in, cannabis has"},"164":{"dur":8,"text":"at least 4 and maybe 50 or 200 psychoactive\nagents, most of whose activity we do not understand."},"172":{"dur":2,"text":"And none of whose interactivity do we understand."},"175":{"dur":7,"text":"So it's a pretty complicated drug and enormously\nvariable,

out that what chemical actually\ngets to your lung and to your bloodstream"},"197":{"dur":4,"text":"and your brain depends, in part, on what temperature\nthe stuff is heated to because the

stoned."},"219":{"dur":6,"text":"It's hard to tell in an illicit market, but\nmy guess is that in the 1968 to 1972 time"},"226":{"dur":4,"text":"frame, which is when we started thinking about\ncannabis...and a lot of our thinking is still"},"230":{"dur":4,"text":"stuck back then...probably the stuff that\nwas available on a college campus averaged"},"235":{"dur":2,"text":"3% THC by

were"},"246":{"dur":2,"text":"probably in the high single digits."},"249":{"dur":2,"text":"THC might have been low double digits."},"251":{"dur":7,"text":"Stuff routinely available in California and\nWashington and Oregon stores between 18% and"},"259":{"dur":1,"text":"24% THC by weight."},"261":{"dur":4,"text":"So really radically different product."},"265":{"dur":7,"text":"And for biological reasons, when you breed\na plant...So what's happened in the meantime"},"272":{"dur":1,"text":"is three things."},"274":{"dur":1,"text":"One is selective breeding."},"276":{"dur":3,"text":"And a second is agronomy."},"279":{"dur":3,"text":"And a third is a change in the way the market\nworks."},"283":{"dur":5,"text":"So selective breeding, you can clearly breed\nplants for anything you want."},"288":{"dur":5,"text":"The people who use a lot of cannabis, who\nare a minority of the users, account for most"},"293":{"dur":1,"text":"of the volume."},"294":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: And, and that's true in almost every..."},"296":{"dur":5,"text":"Mark: That's true for almost every drug, but\nwhat that means is that their tastes dictate"},"301":{"dur":1,"text":"to the market."},"303":{"dur":5,"text":"If you smoke every day, you develop a tolerance\nfor THC, which means in order to get stoned,"},"308":{"dur":2,"text":"you need a lot of THC."},"311":{"dur":7,"text":"So the breeders have bred very high potency\nmaterial, but it's partly dictated by illegality"},"318":{"dur":5,"text":"because it reduced the...I mean, you increase\nthe value of the bulk rate, but...and people"},"323":{"dur":5,"text":"predicted when legalization came in that you'd\nsee a move towards less concentrated products."},"329":{"dur":1,"text":"Absolutely the opposite has happened."},"331":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: That's interesting."},"332":{"dur":5,"text":"Mark: But when you breed for more THC, you're\nbreeding for less of cannabidiol, which is"},"338":{"dur":1,"text":"another major molecule in there."},"339":{"dur":5,"text":"Cannabidiol is a buffer, in effect."},"344":{"dur":2,"text":"So THC is anxiogenic."},"347":{"dur":1,"text":"It creates anxiety."},"348":{"dur":1,"text":"CBD is an anxiolytic."},"350":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, CBD's being looked at as a substitute\nfor the benzodiazepine."},"353":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: Yeah."},"354":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's prized in the medical marijuana,\nsome type of marijuana, cannabis."},"358":{"dur":1,"text":"Mark: Right."},"359":{"dur":4,"text":"Though, again, if you look at actual medical\nmarijuana operations, they're selling...90%"},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"of what they're selling is the same thing\nthe commercial operations are selling."},"367":{"dur":4,"text":"Sally: That goes to the question of how clinical\nthey truly are..."},"371":{"dur":1,"text":"Mark: Exactly."},"372":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: ...but we'll get back to that, too."},"373":{"dur":1,"text":"Mark: Exactly."},"374":{"dur":6,"text":"So but it turns out that in the plant, the\nprecursor chemical that makes THC is the same"},"380":{"dur":1,"text":"as the precursor chemical that makes CBD."},"382":{"dur":3,"text":"So to breed for high THC content, you have\nto breed the CBD out."},"386":{"dur":6,"text":"So if you go to a California store with a\nwebsite, most of their plants are well under"},"393":{"dur":1,"text":"1% CBD."},"395":{"dur":4,"text":"Sometimes just trace amounts, not really measurable\namounts."},"400":{"dur":6,"text":"And that change in ratio is probably as important\nas the change in concentration in generating"},"406":{"dur":1,"text":"more intense experiences."},"408":{"dur":8,"text":"Possibly, this isn't proven by any means,\nbut possibly greater risk of dependency."},"417":{"dur":5,"text":"But in any case, no, this is not your grandfather's\npot."},"422":{"dur":4,"text":"It also turns out, I think, that some of the\nother chemicals already in cannabidiols are"},"427":{"dur":3,"text":"the terpenes matter."},"430":{"dur":5,"text":"And there's one called myrcene, which is suspected\nof being the major cause of what's called"},"435":{"dur":1,"text":"couch lock."},"436":{"dur":4,"text":"So some of the what are called Indica strains,\nthough that's not biologically accurate, have"},"441":{"dur":1,"text":"a lot of myrcene in them."},"442":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's what leads to people just being,\nyou know, lying there still for a couple of"},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"hours."},"448":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: You said couch lock."},"449":{"dur":1,"text":"Mark: Couch lock."},"450":{"dur":1,"text":"Right."},"451":{"dur":3,"text":"So yes, the compositions change."},"454":{"dur":3,"text":"Now for years, I was one of the people who\nsaid, \"Well, who cares?"},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"People titrate."},"459":{"dur":1,"text":"They get as stoned as they want to get stoned."},"461":{"dur":4,"text":"If they can get stoned for one puff rather\nthan four puffs, well, that's better for their"},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"lungs."},"466":{"dur":1,"text":"What's the problem?\""},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"And there are two issues there."},"470":{"dur":7,"text":"One is that the intensity of the experience\ndepends not only on the maximum level, but"},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"also on the rate of change."},"480":{"dur":3,"text":"And so you get a much higher rate of change\nfor more intense products."},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"And also, it turns out people don't titrate\nall that accurately."},"487":{"dur":8,"text":"You know, back when I knew people in college\nwho were smoking, they would take 5 or 6 or"},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"10 hits."},"496":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, at that point, it's pretty easy to titrate\nbecause if you meant to take nine hits and"},"501":{"dur":5,"text":"actually only take, oh, eight hits, it doesn't\nmatter very much."},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"But today's stuff is what we used to call\none-hit dope."},"509":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, it's harder to titrate."},"513":{"dur":7,"text":"So I think there's evidence that there is\na health significance to the increase in potency."},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"And, as I say, it, it has not been reversed\nby legalization."},"525":{"dur":1,"text":"If anything, the opposite."},"526":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: Well, we'll move on."},"528":{"dur":6,"text":"Mark: The other big change is people quote\ncannabis prices per gram or...it used to be"},"534":{"dur":6,"text":"per ounce, now it's per gram...but people\naren't really consuming plant material."},"541":{"dur":3,"text":"They're consuming hours of intoxication."},"545":{"dur":3,"text":"Over the past 20 years, the illicit price\nof cannabis hasn't changed very much."},"549":{"dur":5,"text":"I mean, $10 a gram, $300 an ounce, is a\npretty good number then and now."},"554":{"dur":6,"text":"But the difference is that today's stuff has\nmaybe six times as much intoxicant in it or"},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"four times."},"562":{"dur":5,"text":"So the price of an hour stoned has dropped\nradically."},"567":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think it's that price decrease more\nthan anything else that's driving the dramatic"},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"increase in heavy use."},"573":{"dur":6,"text":"So in 1992, if you just look at the household\nsurvey, of the people who report having used"},"580":{"dur":7,"text":"in the past month, who are technically called\ncurrent users, about 9% said they'd used 25"},"587":{"dur":1,"text":"days or more in that month."},"589":{"dur":5,"text":"So those are the daily, near-daily users,\nthe DND users."},"594":{"dur":3,"text":"That number's up now to 40, 4-0, percent."},"597":{"dur":3,"text":"Forty percent of all the people who say on\na survey that they used at all in the last"},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"month say they use virtually every day."},"604":{"dur":4,"text":"And we know from work that Beau Kilmer did...so\nthat's Jon Caulkins' calculation...we know"},"609":{"dur":5,"text":"from work that Beau Kilmer did that the daily,\nnear-daily users consume about three times"},"614":{"dur":6,"text":"as much per day of use as the less frequent\nusers, presumably because they have a tolerance."},"621":{"dur":5,"text":"So 40% of the users being daily, near daily\nand using three times, they're the whole market."},"626":{"dur":3,"text":"Sally: Any sense of like percentage of the\npopulation in general they are?"},"630":{"dur":7,"text":"Mark: Yeah, so the numbers are roughly 37\nmillion annual users, people who will say"},"637":{"dur":1,"text":"they've used in the past year."},"638":{"dur":5,"text":"A little more than half of those, about 20\nmillion, are past month current users."},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"And eight million are daily, near-daily users."},"646":{"dur":7,"text":"And then if you look at the national household\nsurvey questionnaire, it asks the diagnostic"},"653":{"dur":1,"text":"questions."},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Do you use more than you intend to use?"},"657":{"dur":1,"text":"Do you use more often than you intend to use?"},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"Have you tried to cut down and failed?"},"660":{"dur":1,"text":"Is it causing conflict?"},"662":{"dur":1,"text":"Is it eating up your life?\""},"663":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: Suggesting addiction."},"664":{"dur":1,"text":"Mark: Yeah."},"665":{"dur":1,"text":"These are the diagnostic questions."},"666":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: As opposed to just recreational use."},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"Mark: For DSM-V, right."},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"Again, that's not the same as a diagnostic\ninterview because you'd probe a lot more carefully"},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"if somebody came to you and said, \"I think\nI've got a problem.\""},"676":{"dur":4,"text":"But if you just look at the screening questions,\nabout half of the daily, near-daily users"},"680":{"dur":1,"text":"seem to meet criteria."},"682":{"dur":5,"text":"So that's 4 million people who, you know,\nat least at superficial look, have a cannabis"},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"problem."},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"Self-reported, right?"},"689":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, that's not counting the people who\nare stoned all the time and happy about it."},"693":{"dur":6,"text":"You know, if you ask their parents or their\ngirlfriends whether they had a cannabis problem,"},"699":{"dur":1,"text":"you might get a different answer."},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"But 4 million compares to 16 million for alcohol,\nright?"},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's a lot less."},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"It probably compares to a million for the\nopiates."},"708":{"dur":1,"text":"Sally: Yeah, about a million."},"709":{"dur":4,"text":"Mark: So it is now a substantial looking drug\nproblem."},"714":{"dur":6,"text":"I mean, what I like to say about this is that,\nin the years I've been debating cannabis policy,"},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"we have actually developed for the first time\na serious cannabis problem."},"724":{"dur":9,"text":"In 1979, we didn't have a noticeable cannabis\nproblem and, you know, it's ironic that now"},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"that we're thinking about legalizing it, we\nactually have a problem with it."},"737":{"dur":4,"text":"Sally: And what kind of toll is it taking\nin terms of emergency room visits, missed"},"741":{"dur":1,"text":"work, missed school, drunk driving?"},"743":{"dur":3,"text":"Mark: All right, so let me do this in sequence."},"746":{"dur":5,"text":"ED visits, about half a million mentions a\nyear, which isn't small, but you don't know"},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"how many of those the cannabis was just mentioned\nand wasn't really causal."},"755":{"dur":4,"text":"But anyway, that's not a huge number."},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"Treatment admits, substantial."},"763":{"dur":3,"text":"I think now, after alcohol, the leading cause\nof treatment admits."},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"And some of those are criminal justice referrals."},"768":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's a little dubious."},"771":{"dur":3,"text":"No evidence about, you know, what it does\nto work."},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"A little bit of evidence from Europe on schooling\nand it's not encouraging."},"778":{"dur":3,"text":"This is Olivier Marie's work."},"782":{"dur":5,"text":"When the University of Maastricht...the University\nof Maastricht is in a town which changed its"},"787":{"dur":7,"text":"policy so that you need a Dutch passport to\nget into a cannabis coffee shop...well, Maastricht"},"794":{"dur":2,"text":"has about a third foreign students."},"797":{"dur":3,"text":"So they lost access to the coffee shops."},"800":{"dur":3,"text":"They still had access to cannabis if they\nknew anybody else, but it was a little less"},"803":{"dur":1,"text":"convenient for them."},"805":{"dur":2,"text":"When that happened, their grade point averages\nwent up and the Dutch grade point averages"},"808":{"dur":1,"text":"were flat."},"809":{"dur":4,"text":"And, you know, it's not a huge effect, but\nit's a substantial effect."},"814":{"dur":3,"text":"And those university students now bring that\nback to middle school."},"817":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't think you're very cheerful."},"818":{"dur":9,"text":"And remember, that's a very minor interference\nwith the difficulty of obtaining cannabis."},"828":{"dur":5,"text":"So that's the one I'm most worried about,\nactually, is the educational impact."},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"Stoned driving, I think, is mostly a nonissue."},"836":{"dur":4,"text":"It's a big issue in the public debate."},"841":{"dur":4,"text":"As far as I can tell from the simulator tests,\nif I'm going to use a technical term, if you"},"845":{"dur":5,"text":"get somebody wrecked out of his gourd and\nput him in a driving simulator, he's got about"},"850":{"dur":6,"text":"twice the crash risk of somebody, that same\nperson, flat sober."},"856":{"dur":6,"text":"Now relative risk, too, if you're an epidemiologist,\nit's a big number, but in real life, driving's"},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"a very safe activity."},"865":{"dur":5,"text":"So driving 10 miles stoned out of your gourd\nis just as bad as driving 20 miles sober,"},"871":{"dur":6,"text":"which nobody thinks is improper."},"877":{"dur":3,"text":"The natural comparison is to drunk driving."},"880":{"dur":4,"text":"And so when people passed stoned driving laws,\nthey had the same penalties as drunk driving."},"885":{"dur":5,"text":"If you're driving at a .15 BAC, you've got\na relative crash risk of between 15 and 30,"},"891":{"dur":1,"text":"right?"},"892":{"dur":1,"text":"So cannabis is just not on the map."},"894":{"dur":4,"text":"Cannabis is down there with driving after\nnot having a good night's sleep or driving"},"898":{"dur":2,"text":"with a noisy kid in the back of the car."},"901":{"dur":6,"text":"Not nearly as dangerous as driving using a\nhands-free cell phone, legal in every state."},"907":{"dur":4,"text":"The other problem on stoned driving is we\nhave no good detection mechanism for impairment."},"911":{"dur":4,"text":"So my view is we should come up with some\nkind of clue for it, probably a saliva test,"},"916":{"dur":3,"text":"but make it a traffic ticket, not a criminal\noffense like drunk driving."},"919":{"dur":1,"text":"It just simply doesn't belong on that page."},"921":{"dur":6,"text":"Sally: Would a saliva test be complicated\nby the same problems of a blood test or a"},"928":{"dur":3,"text":"urine test, which is that the molecule hangs\naround for a long time?"},"931":{"dur":3,"text":"Mark: Apparently, the saliva test doesn't\npick up stuff that's coming back from blood."},"935":{"dur":2,"text":"It's just picking up what's in the oral cavity."},"937":{"dur":4,"text":"And so it ought to be reasonably specific\nto use in the last three or four hours."},"942":{"dur":4,"text":"Now look, I'm sure if we had saliva tests\nat the roadside, people would be selling mouthwashes"},"947":{"dur":3,"text":"to beat the saliva test."},"950":{"dur":6,"text":"But the best we're gonna do for cannabis,\ngiven the chemistry of it in the bloodstream,"},"956":{"dur":2,"text":"is we're gonna be able to detect recent use."},"959":{"dur":2,"text":"We're not going to be able to detect impairment."},"962":{"dur":1,"text":"And so we should settle for that."},"963":{"dur":7,"text":"The other thing is any of the blood tests\nwill detect use that's sufficiently far in"},"970":{"dur":1,"text":"the past."},"971":{"dur":2,"text":"So the person, A, isn't impaired at the time\nyou've got it."},"973":{"dur":2,"text":"At least you don't know that he was impaired."},"976":{"dur":5,"text":"But worse, in my view, it means that if you\nsmoked in the last week, whatever the standard"},"982":{"dur":7,"text":"is for stoned driving, you can't possibly\nknow whether you're breaking the law or not."},"989":{"dur":4,"text":"Alcohol's easy, right?"},"993":{"dur":1,"text":"A drink."},"994":{"dur":3,"text":"If you're a normal-sized male, 4 drinks will\nget you to .08."},"997":{"dur":3,"text":"If you're a normal-sized female, 3 drinks\nwill get you to .08."},"1001":{"dur":2,"text":"The liberal will take out about a

level."},"1010":{"dur":1,"text":"Mark: Blood alcohol level."},"1012":{"dur":1,"text":"With cannabis, you just can't."},"1013":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think a law that you cannot know whether\nyou're
