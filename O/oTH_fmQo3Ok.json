deliver single base changes\nscattered all over the genome,"},"193":{"dur":3,"text":"or we can deliver big chunks of DNA\nup to 10 million base pairs"},"197":{"dur":2,"text":"by either a process

way"},"248":{"dur":2,"text":"of doing targeted change"},"250":{"dur":1,"text":"which was the Zn finger nucleases"},"252":{"dur":3,"text":"and these have dominated\nfor the 17 years

2 to 5 of these genes"},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"to increase the diversity \nof the Tasmanian devil"},"475":{"dur":1,"text":"or a few more genes"},"477":{"dur":3,"text":"and you can make the
