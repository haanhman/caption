the audience here,"},"90":{"dur":2,"text":"what is it like to\nsee the colour red?"},"93":{"dur":1,"text":"And you really can't\nput that into words."},"95":{"dur":2,"text":"But, I guess with a physics\nmind oh yeah, of course,"},"97":{"dur":1,"text":"colours have different\nwavelengths"},"99":{"dur":1,"text":"and red has a particular\nwavelength"},"100":{"dur":2,"text":"that it reflects off

sound also emanates\nfrom the sound hole as well."},"226":{"dur":1,"text":"So, it's radiating from\nthe surfaces of the guitar"},"228":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's also coming\nout of the hole there."},"230":{"dur":5,"text":"[ Silence ]"},"236":{"dur":2,"text":"Some basic physics here,\nhow the strings vibrate."},"238":{"dur":2,"text":"This does lead onto\nother

overtones."},"247":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is something I'll\nbe talking about later."},"248":{"dur":2,"text":"And we can actually force\nthose modes on a guitar."},"251":{"dur":3,"text":"If I was

there"},"258":{"dur":0,"text":"for the player to know that."},"259":{"dur":4,"text":"Have a listen to the sound,\nhaving a lot of buzzing."},"263":{"dur":2,"text":"I can't stop that because

the way you play the guitar."},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"And of course, some players\nmight even strum the guitar"},"289":{"dur":2,"text":"halfway along the neck for\nparticular sounds and

like,\nin fact an extraordinary amount."},"302":{"dur":1,"text":"You don't just get\na fundamental."},"303":{"dur":1,"text":"You don't just get\na first overtone."},"305":{"dur":1,"text":"You get a whole mix of those."},"306":{"dur":2,"text":"And so if we just took for\ninstance the first overtone"},"309":{"dur":2,"text":"and fourth that would\nbe a resultant waveform"},"312":{"dur":1,"text":"and algebraic addition\nof those two."},"314":{"dur":3,"text":"And of course, there's a long\nseries of these harmonics"},"317":{"dur":2,"text":"and depending on the\ntype of manufacturer"},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"of the string depends\non what kind"},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"of harmonics you might\nexpect on that string"},"324":{"dur":0,"text":"and also the

I bring it along?"},"333":{"dur":4,"text":"I just invite everybody at the\nmoment to indulge me just to--"},"337":{"dur":1,"text":"it's too late now, because\nyou've probably seen"},"339":{"dur":0,"text":"at the front what I've got."},"340":{"dur":1,"text":"If you can just close your\neyes for a minute I just want"},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"to play a note on a\nparticular

the\nback never saw that."},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"You can tell instantly with\nthat kind of harmonic spectrum"},"363":{"dur":1,"text":"that thing is a violin."},"364":{"dur":1,"text":"Instantly you know that."},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"If we look at a guitar"},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"where does all this\ntransfer of energy happen?"},"371":{"dur":1,"text":"It happens at the\nplace called the bridge"},"373":{"dur":1,"text":"and also the saddle is"},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"that little white\npiece sitting in there."},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"And high quality instruments\nwill make that out of bone."},"381":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, it's the\nbridge and the saddle"},"383":{"dur":3,"text":"that essentially are the\nenergy transferring components"},"386":{"dur":1,"text":"of the guitar where

respond."},"408":{"dur":4,"text":"[ Silence ]"},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay so I'll just-- we'll\ngo back a few steps now"},"415":{"dur":1,"text":"and I'll work back up to the\nslide that we just

of those planks"},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"in jarrah and things\nlike pine for sale."},"451":{"dur":1,"text":"What the wood does is\nit actually cups away"},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"from the centre of the

doing,"},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"I made sure it was at\nleast quarter sawn."},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I went through the\nstacks of wood and got a bit"},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"that okay it has a few knots\non, but at least this is going"},"528":{"dur":3,"text":"to stay relatively flat for me."},"532":{"dur":1,"text":"I think I'll-- yeah in a minute."},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"We'll just show

things."},"590":{"dur":1,"text":"And they have come up\nwith various schemes."},"591":{"dur":3,"text":"I've just illustrated some\nhere for cutting these woods"},"595":{"dur":4,"text":"and trying to

planks"},"603":{"dur":1,"text":"and all those different\ncutting methods"},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"that would yield suitable\nwood for guitar making."},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"So, you do spend a lot of

again."},"616":{"dur":5,"text":"As well as being quarter sawn,\nit's an interesting phenomena"},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"of trees that aren't\nalways straight grained."},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"What we

follow the Sun."},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"So, in the southern hemisphere\nhere a tree that's looking"},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"at a northern facing\nSun will follow that Sun"},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"and track it through the day."},"660":{"dur":0,"text":"Oh it disappears."},"661":{"dur":0,"text":"Oh here it is again."},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"And it'll follow and track\nthat and actually grow a

opposite."},"670":{"dur":1,"text":"And why are tropical\nhardwoods sometimes"},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"so valuable and stable?"},"674":{"dur":1,"text":"It's because they twist\none way and then another."},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"And so they'll just twist back\nand forward and work their way"},"678":{"dur":1,"text":"up and be very, very\nstraight grained"},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"for a long distance\nup their trunks."},"684":{"dur":3,"text":"So, as best as possible if you\ncan, you'll actually cut wood"},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"for guitars out of\nsplit billets."},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"So, someone's cleaved it with an\nax that's followed the natural"},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"split line and then you resaw\nthe board to follow those lines"},"694":{"dur":3,"text":"and that will yield\nvery, very stable wood."},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"Wood used for guitars ideally\nhave a very high stiffness"},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"to weight ratio

student."},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"We want to make a guitar, so\nwe'll buy some cheaper wood"},"713":{"dur":1,"text":"and see what it might\nsound like."},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"So, if I grab the wood,

than sticking to\ntraditional timbers I go out"},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"and just look for physical\nproperties of the timber."},"788":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not particularly interested"},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"in reputations of\nhistoric woods."},"793":{"dur":1,"text":"So, if you want to\nfind stiffness"},"794":{"dur":1,"text":"to weight ratios this\nis how you can
