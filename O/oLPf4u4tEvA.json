they bring it out\nin a conversation."},"586":{"dur":4,"text":"And then have a dialogue you know, what do\nyou see together?"},"590":{"dur":6,"text":"So it's this great opportunity for your work\nto

suggest."},"701":{"dur":4,"text":"So if this the cover, or is it the back?"},"705":{"dur":4,"text":"There's no words here to help me do that,\nthere's also an orientation, so if I look"},"709":{"dur":5,"text":"at this one, it's a blank page on the cover,\nbut I go through then I open up and I see"},"714":{"dur":8,"text":"this continuous rectangle, then a broken rectangle,\nand

simple\nshape on the page, activates that empty white space."},"747":{"dur":4,"text":"It makes that empty white space something\nthat's interesting to look at."},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"There's this space, is it a positive or a\nnegative space?"},"756":{"dur":5,"text":"To me it looks like it could be a key slot,\nlike I could pick up a key, slide it in there"},"762":{"dur":1,"text":"and open up."},"763":{"dur":3,"text":"So if I turn the book upside down, I'm unlocking\nthe book."},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"I can go through this book and look at it."},"769":{"dur":5,"text":"Now when you get to the point where you got\npages that oppose each other to present a"},"775":{"dur":5,"text":"spread, you not only have what you did on\nthe one page but you have what's on the opposite page."},"781":{"dur":1,"text":"And they interact."},"782":{"dur":4,"text":"This is fairly, you know, this is a balanced\nsort of presentation, one's at the top, one's"},"787":{"dur":1,"text":"at the bottom."},"788":{"dur":1,"text":"But what if I turned it this way?"},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"How does it read differently?"},"792":{"dur":4,"text":"This is what you really want the students\nto start exploring, discovering and get excited"},"796":{"dur":5,"text":"about when they view these books, is how did\nthese simple gestures on the page, some not"},"802":{"dur":5,"text":"so simple as you can see in some of these\nother examples, activate this picture plain?"},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"This rectangular white space?"},"810":{"dur":5,"text":"How does that become tall and skinny or how\ndoes it become short and wide?"},"816":{"dur":3,"text":"So encourage them to look at the books in\ndifferent ways."},"819":{"dur":6,"text":"They can even, you can look at it portrait-style,\nand just go through it as you would an ordinary book."},"828":{"dur":5,"text":"You could do that but you could change the\nsequence of the pages, by folding it a different"},"834":{"dur":6,"text":"way, folding it shut a different way, which\nchanges the whole sequence."},"840":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'm physically changing the structure of\nthe book, I'm changing the sequence of the"},"844":{"dur":4,"text":"pages to change the way that all of the pages\nwork together."},"848":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's look at another one here."},"851":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's look at this one a minute."},"854":{"dur":7,"text":"This one, the student used this rectangle\nand the student might say, well that doesn't"},"861":{"dur":4,"text":"look like it follows the rules, it looks like\nthere's 2 rectangular shapes there, 2 shapes"},"865":{"dur":1,"text":"on the page."},"867":{"dur":3,"text":"And what I like to do is turn that back to\nthe student that made it and talk to them"},"871":{"dur":3,"text":"about how they justify doing that."},"875":{"dur":4,"text":"I've had students say, well I started with\none rectangle and I just broke it so I was"},"879":{"dur":2,"text":"using one rectangle but I made it into 2 pieces."},"882":{"dur":3,"text":"I love hearing them talk about that."},"885":{"dur":5,"text":"So if we look at this one, that theme seems\nto carry through the book where there's this"},"891":{"dur":6,"text":"broken up rectangle from the existing rectangle\nand the way that it moves on the page is something"},"897":{"dur":1,"text":"that is exciting."},"898":{"dur":9,"text":"Here it looks like it's just started to break\naway, here it looks like it's emerging from"},"907":{"dur":1,"text":"the top or maybe going back in."},"909":{"dur":4,"text":"This is all sort of an open-ended conversation\nthat you can have with students."},"913":{"dur":6,"text":"And it gets them to start thinking about how\nthese shapes on the page interact."},"919":{"dur":5,"text":"How all this white space over here sets up\ntension and we have this structure over here."},"925":{"dur":6,"text":"Okay so then what if I change the sequence\nof that, what if I did it like this and look"},"931":{"dur":6,"text":"at it again and how it changes the relationship\nof those forms."},"938":{"dur":4,"text":"This was our cover before, now it's in relationship\nto this other page."},"942":{"dur":1,"text":"And how does that make us feel?"},"943":{"dur":5,"text":"Does this shape falling away from this sort\nof heavy oppressing shape?"},"948":{"dur":4,"text":"So that way we're looking at it in portrait\nmode but what if we turned it calendar-style"},"953":{"dur":6,"text":"and looked at it that way."},"959":{"dur":6,"text":"See how it changes and becomes an exciting\nnew composition to talk about."},"965":{"dur":5,"text":"And that's exactly why this is exciting for\nme because students always come up with something"},"970":{"dur":1,"text":"new."},"971":{"dur":6,"text":"There are students that take a real sort of,\nthis is a simple one here."},"977":{"dur":5,"text":"Here's one I was looking for, here let's do the simple one first, so larger shape, so it looks"},"983":{"dur":7,"text":"like it could be a door to shut or open, and\nthen the exciting sort of jumping quality"},"991":{"dur":1,"text":"of these."},"992":{"dur":6,"text":"Again, a blank page which it just adds to\nthe tension of the spread, and then the back."},"998":{"dur":4,"text":"So there's a similarity in here that's real\nconsistent, the size and proportion of these"},"1003":{"dur":1,"text":"is very similar."},"1004":{"dur":9,"text":"So what if I changed the direction, the way\nthat we look at it, look at it calendar-style."},"1014":{"dur":4,"text":"And what if I change the sequence, what if\nwe bury this dark space in the center and"},"1018":{"dur":8,"text":"we have a blank cover this time, and then\nwe go through, uh-oh."},"1027":{"dur":5,"text":"These shapes that were moving freely down\nthe page back and forth are now suddenly confronted"},"1032":{"dur":3,"text":"with this door."},"1036":{"dur":3,"text":"But then we go through the doorway and there\nare still shapes there."},"1040":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's exactly what younger students especially\nwill do they'll start telling a story."},"1044":{"dur":9,"text":"And so the magic of these simple gestures\nthat the form of the book starts to this content"},"1053":{"dur":5,"text":"and that's where you can get kids

directions this could go."},"1066":{"dur":6,"text":"I wanted to show you this one because this\none's an example, this one was quite simple,"},"1072":{"dur":6,"text":"actually not so simple, simple in it's structure\nand it's execution was nicely done but this"},"1079":{"dur":5,"text":"one, this person got very creative and they\nactually used their rectangles and added some"},"1084":{"dur":1,"text":"new dimensions to the book."},"1086":{"dur":7,"text":"See we have this page, this new page that's\nadded sort of using the rectangle, glued a"},"1093":{"dur":7,"text":"portion of it down and left a side of it flat,\noh look, we have a white rectangle and a black rectangle."},"1104":{"dur":5,"text":"So this is a really good example of the

that?"},"1143":{"dur":6,"text":"So, the other neat thing about this format,\nthis single page format that I really like"},"1150":{"dur":4,"text":"and this is another way to talk about the\ncomposition, is I can open this entire book"},"1155":{"dur":12,"text":"up and look at it as a larger composition."},"1167":{"dur":3,"text":"You can't do this with all the books but some\nof them you can."},"1170":{"dur":8,"text":"So I have this really great sort of minimalist\npainting, black and white."},"1178":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is the magic of this form is in the\nunpacking, it's really at this point in this"},"1183":{"dur":6,"text":"whole process that I get very excited about,\nthis is the most exciting point."},"1190":{"dur":3,"text":"The rest has been sort of the getting here."},"1193":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is where the teaching and learning\nmoments happen."},"1195":{"dur":5,"text":"Because you listen to your students come up\nwith ideas, they come up with ideas
