guys"},"18":{"dur":1,"text":"a really simple question"},"19":{"dur":3,"text":"that may take a little bit longer\nthan two seconds to answer."},"24":{"dur":3,"text":"Have you ever personally\nmet your soul mate?"},"28":{"dur":1,"text":"(Audience) Yes."},"31":{"dur":3,"text":"Ashley Clift-Jennings: I hear\nsome yeses, not reallys..."},"35":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"37":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah, they're pretty hard\nto come by, right?"},"39":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"41":{"dur":3,"text":"So now, think about what made\nthat person your soul mate."},"45":{"dur":1,"text":"Was it the way they looked?"},"47":{"dur":3,"text":"Was it the career that they had?"},"50":{"dur":2,"text":"Was it the way\nthey connected with your soul?"},"53":{"dur":3,"text":"Was it the fact\nthey were also in the same religion?"},"58":{"dur":2,"text":"There is a million different reasons"},"60":{"dur":4,"text":"why we feel connected\nto another person in that deep way."},"65":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I grew up in a Christian environment,"},"70":{"dur":3,"text":"and I was dead-set\non finding my soul mate."},"73":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I knew I wasn't going to find\nthis person in a bar, or at a club,"},"78":{"dur":2,"text":"and that this person had to have\nreally high character,"},"81":{"dur":5,"text":"had to have respect for women,\nhad to be good-looking,"},"87":{"dur":6,"text":"and had to love me for who I was,\nbecause I'm kind of a unique character."},"94":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I went along life,\nwent to an Ivy League school,"},"98":{"dur":1,"text":"played soccer,"},"100":{"dur":3,"text":"achieved whatever I could achieve\nand grasp at at that moment,"},"103":{"dur":1,"text":"but one thing that always lingered"},"105":{"dur":3,"text":"is that I really wanted to find\nthis one thing, which was my soul mate."},"109":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I'm like 24, 25 years old,"},"112":{"dur":2,"text":"and by this time\nin the Christian community,"},"114":{"dur":3,"text":"it's like your eggs are probably\ngetting cobwebby at this point."},"118":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"120":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, we think 25, that's not too old,\nbut back then, I felt old."},"124":{"dur":2,"text":"So one night, I was browsing\non the Internet,"},"127":{"dur":4,"text":"and I'm really into\nthe Myers-Briggs personality test,"},"131":{"dur":1,"text":"so I was looking up,"},"132":{"dur":4,"text":"I wanted to find a guy\nwho was an INFJ male --"},"136":{"dur":2,"text":"(Laughter)"},"139":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I just typed into Google,\n\"INFJ male,\" right?"},"142":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"144":{"dur":1,"text":"And there were two results,"},"146":{"dur":3,"text":"and one of them happened to be\nmy future spouse."},"149":{"dur":2,"text":"(Laughter)"},"152":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I had reached out to him, we met up --"},"155":{"dur":2,"text":"I happened to be doing\nsocial work in Pasadena,"},"157":{"dur":2,"text":"he happened to be a software developer"},"159":{"dur":3,"text":"working for a start-up in Pasadena,\nbut living in Reno --"},"162":{"dur":5,"text":"and we had this amazing connection,\nwe had this whirlwind courtship,"},"167":{"dur":3,"text":"and within six months,\nto all of our families dismay,"},"171":{"dur":1,"text":"we were married."},"172":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"174":{"dur":1,"text":"But it made sense!"},"175":{"dur":1,"text":"Our families, they got it."},"177":{"dur":2,"text":"They saw us together, and they understood,"},"179":{"dur":2,"text":"\"These two people are super-compatible,"},"181":{"dur":2,"text":"they have a tremendous amount\nof respect for one another,"},"184":{"dur":2,"text":"and they literally\nmake each other better people.\""},"187":{"dur":4,"text":"So, he was like the yin to my yang,\nhe was a software developer,"},"191":{"dur":6,"text":"super chill, relaxed,\ngoes at a slow pace, but a steady pace."},"197":{"dur":3,"text":"And then, I was just crazy,\nerratic, creative."},"201":{"dur":5,"text":"And it just worked like lock and key,\njust so, so, so seamless."},"207":{"dur":2,"text":"And this went along for --\nI moved to Reno,"},"210":{"dur":3,"text":"dropped out of grad school, moved to Reno,\nstarted working in start-ups,"},"214":{"dur":3,"text":"and started doing start-uppy things\nwith my new husband."},"218":{"dur":2,"text":"And every night, we would go out\nto restaurants, or bars,"},"220":{"dur":2,"text":"just talk about ideas."},"222":{"dur":3,"text":"It was like TED talks all the time."},"226":{"dur":3,"text":"We just really enjoyed each other's minds."},"229":{"dur":2,"text":"And we were soul mates, literally."},"232":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, this went along,\nwe've been married now nine years,"},"236":{"dur":1,"text":"so this went along for a good while,"},"237":{"dur":3,"text":"and it felt like the most\npeaceful time in my entire life."},"241":{"dur":3,"text":"I felt like I had a home\ninside this person's soul,"},"245":{"dur":2,"text":"and this person lived with me,\nwe worked together,"},"247":{"dur":3,"text":"oftentimes we did projects together,\nwe dreamed together,"},"251":{"dur":5,"text":"we bought a house together,\nI helped him raise my step-kids together."},"257":{"dur":4,"text":"And everything just seemed,\nit seemed like I had won the lottery,"},"261":{"dur":3,"text":"like I could check that box off,\nlike \"Found my soul mate.\""},"266":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, you can imagine, one day,"},"271":{"dur":4,"text":"I was told something\nthat would change my life,"},"277":{"dur":3,"text":"I was told that my spouse was transgender."},"285":{"dur":3,"text":"You could probably\nhear a pin drop right now."},"289":{"dur":2,"text":"And my response was interesting,\nmy first response was,"},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"\"You gotta be fucking kidding me.\""},"294":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"297":{"dur":2,"text":"My second response was,"},"299":{"dur":4,"text":"\"OK, tell me more, you know,\nlike what does this mean for us?"},"303":{"dur":4,"text":"And what do you have to do to feel whole"},"308":{"dur":3,"text":"and to feel like\nyou feel good in your body?\""},"312":{"dur":5,"text":"So, this was about three years ago now,\nand we are still married,"},"318":{"dur":3,"text":"and this took me through\nthis process of really researching,"},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"what does it mean to be transgender?"},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"For my spouse, it meant\nthat she was not comfortable"},"328":{"dur":1,"text":"in her male body,"},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"and that she needed\nto medically transition."},"333":{"dur":5,"text":"Now for me, if you or anybody out there\nis thinking, \"Shoot!\""},"338":{"dur":3,"text":"You're looking at your partner\nright now and being like -- (Laughter)"},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Are you going to drop this bomb on me?\""},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"It's been an interesting journey,"},"349":{"dur":4,"text":"I would love to say -- I was always\nvery PC, and very open-minded,"},"354":{"dur":2,"text":"and very encouraging of her transition."},"356":{"dur":1,"text":"She did give me the option, she said,"},"358":{"dur":3,"text":"\"You know, if this ends\nour relationship, I will not do this.\""},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"I just had a tremendous amount of respect"},"363":{"dur":5,"text":"for how much she respected\nour marriage and me, as a human."},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"So, it's like I had\nall this respect for her,"},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"and I wanted the best for her,\nand I wanted her to be whole,"},"376":{"dur":2,"text":"and at the same time,\nI couldn't put words to it,"},"379":{"dur":3,"text":"but I was feeling like somebody\nwas dying, you know?"},"383":{"dur":3,"text":"It was like somebody\nthat I knew was going away,"},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"and there was a new person coming in."},"389":{"dur":4,"text":"And part of my struggle is really real,"},"393":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's really just\nthe natural progression"},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"of how one would feel\nwhen their spouse transitions."},"400":{"dur":1,"text":"And then, there's another part of it,"},"401":{"dur":3,"text":"which is more like\naround 60% of my reaction,"},"405":{"dur":3,"text":"and that's what is known\nas internalized transphobia."},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"And I didn't even know I had it."},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"It's very much --\nAlex talked about programming"},"415":{"dur":6,"text":"and what men and boys have been programmed\nto think about women and sexuality,"},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"and I think as a society,\nwe've been programmed to think"},"424":{"dur":4,"text":"that people who don't fit into the binary,"},"429":{"dur":1,"text":"who aren't men or women,"},"431":{"dur":3,"text":"or who were born as a sex\nthat they don't identify with,"},"435":{"dur":4,"text":"that those people are different,\nor weird, or strange."},"440":{"dur":3,"text":"And so imagine, when I know\nthis person inside and out,"},"444":{"dur":5,"text":"I have been married to this person\nfor six years by this point,"},"449":{"dur":3,"text":"and I adored every fiber\nof this person's being."},"452":{"dur":5,"text":"So you can imagine that me,\nof all people, would understand"},"458":{"dur":4,"text":"and realize that this is a normal person,"},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"who has a very serious condition\nthat is treatable."},"466":{"dur":6,"text":"But it was hard, because I still felt\nthis sense of embarrassment, a little bit,"},"472":{"dur":3,"text":"or shame, that we were now different."},"476":{"dur":1,"text":"Right?"},"477":{"dur":3,"text":"So I had to go through my entire process,\nyou know, this has been three years,"},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"but I've had to do a lot of hard work"},"483":{"dur":5,"text":"on \"What does it mean to be married\nto somebody who is transgender?"},"488":{"dur":3,"text":"What does that mean about my sexuality?\nDoes that mean that I am now a lesbian?\""},"492":{"dur":1,"text":"Because when we go out, of course,"},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"people see us and they just think\nthat we're a lesbian couple."},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"That's not entirely accurate."},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"What does it mean --\nyou know, we go to the gym,"},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"and we go to the locker room together,\nand we swim together,"},"507":{"dur":3,"text":"and all these things lead us\nto interactions with people"},"511":{"dur":4,"text":"that could or could not\nbe understanding of our situation."},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"And that was hard for me,\nit was hard for me to go"},"518":{"dur":1,"text":"from having all this privilege"},"520":{"dur":6,"text":"as a white, middle-class female,\nwho feels OK being a female,"},"527":{"dur":5,"text":"who is married to a male,\nso I was in a heterosexual relationship,"},"533":{"dur":3,"text":"and I had all this privilege\nthat I didn't even know that I had."},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"So, as we're going through this journey,"},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"it's like we're learning\nnew things everyday,"},"544":{"dur":3,"text":"and I'm learning what words to say,\nwhat words not to say;"},"547":{"dur":5,"text":"I'm learning what works in the bedroom,\nwhat doesn't work in the bedroom, right?"},"552":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm relearning all sorts of things,\nbut what I'm learning the most"},"556":{"dur":5,"text":"is that a lot of my fear\nabout my spouse changing"},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"was really imposed from the outside,"},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"it was really my fear\nof what other people would think."},"569":{"dur":1,"text":"And so now, I stand here today."},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"I am the proud wife\nof a transgender woman,"},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"and she is still my soul mate."},"576":{"dur":3,"text":"And I would know she is my soul mate\nif this room was dark right now,"},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"I would know how to find her in this room."},"584":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think that's the lesson\nto take from all this"},"587":{"dur":5,"text":"is that people have a patina,\nthey have a presence in the world,"},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"they have a look, or they have a job,"},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"or they have all these things\nthat are outward-facing,"},"598":{"dur":3,"text":"that everybody identifies them by\nand puts them into boxes;"},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"that's how we categorize people\nwhen we get to know them."},"604":{"dur":1,"text":"But underneath, there's a soul,"},"606":{"dur":3,"text":"and that soul is\nso much deeper and stronger,"},"610":{"dur":4,"text":"and so much more identifiable\nthan that patina."},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"So, my challenge to you today is,"},"618":{"dur":4,"text":"\"Do you know, would you even know\nhow to recognize your soul mate?\""},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"If you are going out\nin the world right now,"},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"would you know what you are looking for?"},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"Thank you very much, it's been a pleasure."},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"(Applause)"}}
