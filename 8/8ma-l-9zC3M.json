Wolnir's time,"},"1275":{"dur":4,"text":"there were other lords who had their crowns rightful bequeathed upon them,"},"1280":{"dur":2,"text":"but Wolnir brought them to their knees

lord"},"1290":{"dur":2,"text":"keen to outlive all others,"},"1292":{"dur":2,"text":"reminds me a lot of what we did in Dark Souls Two."},"1295":{"dur":2,"text":"Anyway, somehow Wolnir himself"},"1298":{"dur":1,"text":"fell to the Abyss, and"},"1300":{"dur":2,"text":"he was gripped by this fear of true darkness"},"1303":{"dur":3,"text":"and he pleaded to the gods for the first time"},"1306":{"dur":1,"text":"In our boss fight with him,"},"1308":{"dur":2,"text":"there is a darkness below Wolnir,"},"1310":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's struggling to consume him,"},"1313":{"dur":2,"text":"but Wolnir had his Holy Sword"},"1315":{"dur":4,"text":"and he had three armlets that he stripped from the corpses of clerics"},"1319":{"dur":3,"text":"and these things

let's go back up to the Abysswatchers for a second and see if this theory holds any weight."},"1370":{"dur":3,"text":"Eventually, the Abysswatchers became Lords of Cinder."},"1374":{"dur":3,"text":"Their shared Wolf's Blood served their mandate as lords,"},"1377":{"dur":2,"text":"essentially, it meant the requirements."},"1379":{"dur":4,"text":"To gain access to the Abysswatchers, you have to extinguish three flames,"},"1383":{"dur":2,"text":"and I've always wondered why this ritual existed."},"1386":{"dur":3,"text":"It felt very video gamey and out of

looks like Nito, and one looks like the Bed of Chaos,"},"1400":{"dur":2,"text":"three of the main lords in Dark Souls One,"},"1402":{"dur":6,"text":"and these were the souls you had to collect to gain

the door, that explains the ritual."},"1417":{"dur":3,"text":"Anyway, that's more a piece of trivia than anything."},"1421":{"dur":3,"text":"After the Legion's Watchers became Lords of Cinder,"},"1424":{"dur":2,"text":"the Wolf Blood dried up,"},"1426":{"dur":3,"text":"and Farron was consumed by a festering wood"},"1429":{"dur":1,"text":"Dark Wraiths began to

to link the Fire once more"},"1441":{"dur":3,"text":"may have been affected by the Abyss as well."},"1444":{"dur":1,"text":"So here's the theory,"},"1445":{"dur":3,"text":"the Abysswatchers were driven to seek out the Abyss, right?"},"1449":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, what if, upon they ressurection,"},"1452":{"dur":2,"text":"the Abyss far below in the Catacombs of Carthus"},"1455":{"dur":2,"text":"crept into the Abysswatchers themselves?"},"1458":{"dur":5,"text":"This would explain why the Abysswatchers are locked in endless combat with themselves"},"1463":{"dur":4,"text":"because they're driven to seek out the Abyss, but they also can't die"},"1467":{"dur":2,"text":"so they're locked in endless combat."},"1470":{"dur":4,"text":"When I read this theory in the commends, something else clicked as well."},"1474":{"dur":4,"text":"the Wolf Knight Armour, which belonged to Artorias who fell to the Abyss,"},"1478":{"dur":2,"text":"says that the armour of the Abysswatchers"},"1481":{"dur":2,"text":"suggests their own eventual end."},"1484":{"dur":0,"text":"So,"},"1485":{"dur":2,"text":"the game is drawing a parallel

thing,"},"1498":{"dur":2,"text":"when you look closely at their armour,"},"1500":{"dur":4,"text":"you realise it has black tendrils of the Abyss rising up"},"1504":{"dur":3,"text":"so the armour is showing us that they fell to the Abyss..."},"1508":{"dur":1,"text":"probably."},"1509":{"dur":3,"text":"This theory isn't concrete and no one should take it as such,"},"1513":{"dur":3,"text":"but I think it's the best explanation for their in-fighting."},"1516":{"dur":2,"text":"It's my favourite explanation anyway,"},"1519":{"dur":3,"text":"and mostly, this one was all you guys, so thank you. :)"},"1525":{"dur":1,"text":"Onwards to Lothric,"},"1526":{"dur":2,"text":"the knights of Lothric were hunters of dragons,"},"1529":{"dur":3,"text":"explaining their affinity with lightning and why

shores"},"1540":{"dur":4,"text":"The knight has served as one of the three pillar of Lothric since Ancient Times,"},"1544":{"dur":4,"text":"and it shares place along side the Wyverns as a symbol of Lothric."},"1548":{"dur":3,"text":"However, tales of dragons layers are now a rare thing"},"1552":{"dur":4,"text":"and they're told only in fragments and in whispers in remote

Pilgrim Butterfly"},"1574":{"dur":2,"text":"Now the Soul of the Dragonslayer Armour"},"1577":{"dur":3,"text":"is the only mention of these butterfly creatures,"},"1580":{"dur":3,"text":"so speculation

get,"},"1588":{"dur":2,"text":"you'll see that they're flesh and bone"},"1590":{"dur":4,"text":"and they're almost bent backwards with a ribcage jutting outwards."},"1595":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, their name is one of the biggest clues we have,"},"1598":{"dur":4,"text":"and the word pilgrim makes me think of the Pilgrims of Londor,"},"1602":{"dur":3,"text":"who all died on their way to the peak of Lothric."},"1605":{"dur":1,"text":"And just like these pilgrims,"},"1607":{"dur":4,"text":"these Pilgrim Butterflies fly upwards to the peak of Lothric, as well."},"1611":{"dur":4,"text":"And in both these cases, with the Pilgrims and the Pilgrim Butterflies,"},"1616":{"dur":3,"text":"we have no real idea why either of them are going up"},"1619":{"dur":4,"text":"so perhaps we'll learn more if ever

Butterflies"},"1630":{"dur":3,"text":"because the bottom line is we don't know what they are."},"1633":{"dur":1,"text":"Next is the Archives,"},"1635":{"dur":4,"text":"and beyond the Archives is Prince Lothric and his brother, Lorian."},"1640":{"dur":0,"text":"Curiously,"},"1641":{"dur":2,"text":"these are the only Lords of Cinder"},"1643":{"dur":4,"text":"who were not featured in the opening cutscene of lords being ressurected,"},"1648":{"dur":3,"text":"and I believe, that's because they never linked the Fire,"},"1651":{"dur":1,"text":"and I think"},"1652":{"dur":6,"text":"their rejection of linking the Fire might have been what set all of the desperate resurrections into motion."},"1659":{"dur":5,"text":"This is just a theory, but I think it's backed up by most of these descriptions and this dialogue:"},"1677":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's Prince Lothric and Lorian, his brother."},"1680":{"dur":2,"text":"Lorian is the eldest and before he was crippled,"},"1683":{"dur":3,"text":"he was a knight who single-handedly slayed a Demon Prince,"},"1687":{"dur":3,"text":"the victory eternally scorching his sword with flame."},"1691":{"dur":6,"text":"The Cinders of A Lord states that the Lothric Bloodline was obsessed with creating a worthy heir."},"1697":{"dur":6,"text":"They needed someone to link the Flame, and for some reason, Lorian did not suffice,"},"1703":{"dur":4,"text":"so they put their faith in the next born, Prince Lothric."},"1707":{"dur":3,"text":"As his throne states, \"last hope of his line\""},"1712":{"dur":2,"text":"Prince Lothrics, destined to be a Lord of Cinder,"},"1715":{"dur":3,"text":"was born into swaddling clothes used in ancient prayer"},"1719":{"dur":2,"text":"and they are all that he has ever worn."},"1722":{"dur":2,"text":"He was cherished by

that."},"1749":{"dur":2,"text":"But after mentioning these unspeakable means,"},"1751":{"dur":3,"text":"the Cinder description goes on to say that"},"1754":{"dur":3,"text":"the path to linking the Fire is a cursed one indeed."},"1758":{"dur":3,"text":"So Prince Lothric was cursed.

saying,"},"1777":{"dur":1,"text":"\"For that is our curse.\""},"1779":{"dur":4,"text":"So maybe being unable to die itself is the Fire Linking Curse,"},"1784":{"dur":1,"text":"and why he says,"},"1795":{"dur":6,"text":"After becoming one, the Souls of the Twin Princes says that they rejected their duty to become Lords of Cinder"},"1801":{"dur":5,"text":"and settled down far, far away to watch the fire fade from a distance."},"1806":{"dur":3,"text":"The curse has made their souls nearly inseparable."},"1809":{"dur":5,"text":"So, why did Lothric grow to despise and reject his duty as a Lord of Cinder?"},"1815":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, it's very likely due to a man named as the First of the Scholars,"},"1820":{"dur":1,"text":"Soul Stream says that"},"1822":{"dur":3,"text":"he was alleged to be a private mentor of the Royal Prince"},"1826":{"dur":2,"text":"and that he doubted the Linking of the Fire."},"1829":{"dur":2,"text":"So, it's very likely that this
