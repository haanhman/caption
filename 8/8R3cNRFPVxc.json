company."},"312":{"dur":2,"text":"And so what I did was--\nand I didn't know this--"},"315":{"dur":3,"text":"but I created these\nlittle pins that everybody"},"318":{"dur":1,"text":"could wear with Willis on it."},"320":{"dur":1,"text":"And I thought that if\neverybody wore a pin"},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"they'd become sort of\nlike part of the company."},"324":{"dur":1,"text":"And everybody would\nstart to feel a sense"},"326":{"dur":2,"text":"of being a part of things."},"328":{"dur":3,"text":"And I didn't know the British\ndon't like wearing pins."},"331":{"dur":1,"text":"Nobody told me that."},"333":{"dur":3,"text":"As a matter of fact, they're\nreally disgusted with the pin."},"336":{"dur":3,"text":"But they knew that\nwhen I showed up,"},"340":{"dur":1,"text":"if they didn't

on."},"348":{"dur":3,"text":"So when people would\nwalk down the hall,"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"I always knew that they\ndidn't have a pin on,"},"354":{"dur":2,"text":"because a woman would\ngo in the

a reason\nto not have their pin on."},"370":{"dur":2,"text":"So I get the one guy,\nand I look at his lapel,"},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't say anything to him."},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"And he says, \"Oh,\nMr. Chairman, I'm"},"378":{"dur":1,"text":"sorry I don't have my pin on."},"380":{"dur":3,"text":"I left it on my pajamas.\""},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"When you think\nabout that, and you"},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"think about that\nkind of humor, you"},"388":{"dur":2,"text":"wouldn't think that\nwould come from what"},"390":{"dur":3,"text":"your perception is of a

them."},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"So I said, this makes me\nnervous, because I'm a toucher."},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"Like I did with all of you, I\nsaid hello when you came in."},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"It's just the way I am."},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"So I meet him\noutside the building."},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"And interestingly\nenough, he drives up"},"471":{"dur":1,"text":"with his own Range Rover."},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"There's no entourage."},"474":{"dur":1,"text":"He just drives up by himself."},"476":{"dur":0,"text":"He gets out of the car."},"477":{"dur":1,"text":"So I feel more\ncomfortable with him."},"478":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's going to be\nlike three or four"},"480":{"dur":3,"text":"hours before the two of\nus dedicate the building."},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"So I take him\naround and so forth."},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"And I said to him,\nI gotta tell you."},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm a little bit

anybody,\nany place in the world,"},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"tell me otherwise."},"581":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you understand that as\nyou're dealing with the world--"},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"the message in that\nprinciple is that you're"},"587":{"dur":1,"text":"dealing with the world."},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"We may look different."},"590":{"dur":1,"text":"We may talk different."},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"But at the end of the day,\nwe've all got the same plumbing."},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"We all got the same insides."},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"We all got the same

take my cell phone out,"},"620":{"dur":1,"text":"and I google it."},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"But one thing that you can't\ndo, and you ought to try it,"},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"is try googling your heart."},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"Or try googling my heart."},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"And you'll get the\nlyrics of a song."},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"You'll get the way\nthe heart is

everything else"},"648":{"dur":0,"text":"that you need to do."},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"So that is the first principle."},"651":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's really\ninteresting

my heart."},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"And what I mean by\nthat in that principle"},"710":{"dur":3,"text":"is that today nobody\ntakes any risks."},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"Nobody goes out\nand does anything"},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"unless a poll was taken."},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"Nobody does anything\nunless a survey is taken."},"721":{"dur":3,"text":"Nobody does anything\nunless there's a

think is right."},"733":{"dur":4,"text":"And I tell a couple of stories\nin the book about that."},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"One of the stories\nI tell is in 2000,"},"741":{"dur":3,"text":"when I became

company."},"749":{"dur":1,"text":"And the company\nwasn't doing well."},"751":{"dur":3,"text":"So I wanted to see\neverything that was going on."},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"So I looked at the\nbenefits
