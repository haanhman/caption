Edinburgh."},"17":{"dur":0,"text":"Sure."},"18":{"dur":6,"text":"So, my name's Dave Reay, I'm a professor\nof Carbon Management here at Edinburgh."},"24":{"dur":3,"text":"I've worked on climate change for\nover 20 years now."},"28":{"dur":3,"text":"I specialize in how greenhouse gases,"},"32":{"dur":3,"text":"the things we're responsible for,\na lot of the climate change we're seeing,"},"36":{"dur":3,"text":"how they're emitted and\nwhat we can do to reduce them."},"39":{"dur":3,"text":"From everything from how we move about,\nfrom transport,"},"43":{"dur":4,"text":"to food we grow, through to forestry and\nhow we can actually absorb some of"},"47":{"dur":3,"text":"these greenhouse gases by protecting\nour forests more effectively."},"52":{"dur":0,"text":"Okay."},"53":{"dur":4,"text":"So on our course so far,\nwe've been interested in trying to find"},"57":{"dur":5,"text":"personal responses to some big challenges\nthat we face, things like climate change."},"62":{"dur":3,"text":"I wonder if you could talk\na little bit about that as well?"},"65":{"dur":2,"text":">> Yes.\nSo it's a subject dear to my heart in"},"68":{"dur":4,"text":"terms of how individuals can\nplay a part in climate change."},"72":{"dur":5,"text":"Climate change is often, I guess,\nperceived as this huge global challenge,"},"77":{"dur":4,"text":"which it is but just so big none of\nus can do anything by ourselves."},"82":{"dur":2,"text":"So a lot of my research over\nthe years has been looking at"},"85":{"dur":5,"text":"how we as individuals can actually play\na part and one of the key things to"},"90":{"dur":3,"text":"unlocking that I think is thinking\nabout what climate change is."},"93":{"dur":3,"text":"So, what we're seeing now is\nclimate change all over the world."},"97":{"dur":4,"text":"It's already happening, and\nour projections, basically,"},"101":{"dur":3,"text":"understanding how the climate will\nchange over the 21st century,"},"104":{"dur":4,"text":"is that it will get warmer\nby something between two and"},"109":{"dur":4,"text":"five degree centigrade is\nlikely over the century."},"113":{"dur":4,"text":"The main cause of that as far as\na scientific understanding goes,"},"117":{"dur":2,"text":"is our emissions of greenhouse gasses,"},"120":{"dur":2,"text":"particularly carbon dioxide,\nwhich we hear a lot about."},"122":{"dur":4,"text":"So we're emitting a lot of carbon dioxide\nthrough burning fossil fuel, mainly, but"},"126":{"dur":5,"text":"also through land use change, through\nfarms expanding, cutting down trees."},"131":{"dur":4,"text":"So if we go on as we have been doing, in\nterms of emitting these greenhouse gasses,"},"135":{"dur":3,"text":"then we'll get more warming,\nand as the planet warms up,"},"139":{"dur":3,"text":"then we get changes in\nterms of rainfall patterns."},"143":{"dur":2,"text":"Wetter areas tend to get wetter,\nin the future climate,"},"146":{"dur":4,"text":"drier areas tend to drier and\neverywhere tends to get warmer."},"150":{"dur":5,"text":"So we have a series of impacts that\nwe're facing already in terms of climate"},"155":{"dur":5,"text":"change and the more we emit greenhouse\ngasses, the more climate change we get."},"160":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's the kind of nub of it and that's\nwhere you think well, what can I do?"},"163":{"dur":2,"text":"The emissions are coming\nfrom fossil fuel burning,"},"166":{"dur":2,"text":"their coming from big power stations."},"168":{"dur":2,"text":"Surely, it's all down to big business and"},"171":{"dur":3,"text":"government but then if you think\nabout that power station and"},"174":{"dur":4,"text":"you think about what its doing,\nit's there to give us the electricity for"},"179":{"dur":4,"text":"our homes and for\nthe gadgets we're running."},"184":{"dur":3,"text":"If you think about oil refineries and\nthe big petrol companies,"},"187":{"dur":4,"text":"they are there to give us the fuel for\nour cars and for our houses and"},"192":{"dur":5,"text":"to the power the factories, which\ngive us our iPads and our buckets and"},"197":{"dur":2,"text":"our watering cans, and\nthe stuff we produce."},"199":{"dur":1,"text":"The farms are there,"},"201":{"dur":4,"text":"not for any other purpose really than\nto give us the food that we eat."},"205":{"dur":5,"text":"So, as consumers, as individuals,\nwe have the power to tackle climate change"},"210":{"dur":4,"text":"because the decisions we make individually\nand as a collective then have an impact in"},"214":{"dur":3,"text":"terms of just how many power stations\nwe have, how many farms we need."},"218":{"dur":4,"text":"So that's where it comes\ndown to individuals actually"},"223":{"dur":3,"text":"being the crux of tackling climate change."},"226":{"dur":3,"text":"We think about what an individual can do,\nand"},"229":{"dur":2,"text":"we think about all the sectors\nacross our society."},"232":{"dur":3,"text":"So transport being a perfect example\nof where we've got lots of carbon"},"235":{"dur":2,"text":"dioxide emissions, a key issue for\ntackling climate change."},"239":{"dur":4,"text":"A lot of these emissions are coming\nfrom private transport, from cars."},"244":{"dur":3,"text":"So we have, as individuals,\na choice between a big car or a small car,"},"248":{"dur":2,"text":"which can make a big difference\nin carbon emissions."},"251":{"dur":3,"text":"We have the choice between flying a lot or"},"254":{"dur":4,"text":"maybe choosing to use video\nconferencing for meetings more and"},"258":{"dur":4,"text":"holidaying closer to home using a train,\nfor instance."},"263":{"dur":4,"text":"In terms of a lot of our transport\nemissions, around the city, a city like"},"267":{"dur":4,"text":"lovely Edinburgh, one of the issues\nhere we have, in terms of emissions,"},"272":{"dur":3,"text":"is the use of public transport, and\nhow we get more people to opt into that."},"276":{"dur":4,"text":"Partly, that's about providing good\ntransport facilities like our lovely tram"},"280":{"dur":3,"text":"but also us opting to use it,\nso that individual action."},"285":{"dur":6,"text":"As an individual in the UK, our carbon\nfootprint is about 10 tons per person."},"292":{"dur":1,"text":"In some countries, it's much higher."},"293":{"dur":3,"text":"In the U.S.,\nit's about 20 tons per person."},"296":{"dur":2,"text":"In some countries like China,\nit's about 5 or 6."},"298":{"dur":6,"text":"So we've all got our own footprint on\nthe climate, in terms of our emissions."},"305":{"dur":4,"text":"If we break that down into what we can do,\nso if we take transport, if we take what"},"309":{"dur":5,"text":"we do around our own homes in terms of\nenergy efficiency, turn down thermostat"},"314":{"dur":4,"text":"a bit, making use of micro-generation\ntechnology like solar panels."},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"If you look at all\nthe things that we can do,"},"321":{"dur":5,"text":"we can cut our individual emissions by\nabout 80% for our rich country lifestyles."},"326":{"dur":0,"text":">> Mm-hm."},"327":{"dur":2,"text":">> It just so happens 80% is"},"329":{"dur":4,"text":"the cut we need globally to ensure\nwe avoid dangerous climate change."},"334":{"dur":5,"text":"So I talked about this threat\nof warming getting up to three,"},"339":{"dur":5,"text":"four, maybe five degrees centigrade\nincrease, globally, over the 21st century."},"345":{"dur":4,"text":"If we get into that

drought impact and"},"356":{"dur":3,"text":"flood impact,\nsea level rise is a real risk as well for"},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"millions around the world\nin low level areas."},"362":{"dur":4,"text":"So that's a feature which we can\ntalk about in terms of Hollywood and"},"366":{"dur":5,"text":"kind of the climate disaster if we get\ninto that very severe amount of warming."},"372":{"dur":5,"text":"But that's a choice we have, in terms\nof how much warming we're going to get."},"377":{"dur":4,"text":"We'll get some warming but if we get\nthat cut in emissions of 70-80% now in"},"381":{"dur":5,"text":"emissions, we will avoid that\ndangerous climate change and"},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"we can do that as individuals\nin terms of our own actions."},"389":{"dur":3,"text":"But we can also do that very powerfully,\nthrough our communities,"},"393":{"dur":4,"text":"through our political representatives,\nour MPs in this country, or MSPs,"},"397":{"dur":5,"text":"by making it clear that climate change\nis something we want to see action on,"},"403":{"dur":3,"text":"and that they should help us doing that\nthrough policy, through regulation."},"406":{"dur":4,"text":"Through providing good public transport\nand measures that could mean our"},"410":{"dur":4,"text":"appliances are more efficient our,\nour grid, the electricity that"},"414":{"dur":4,"text":"provides us is lower carbon in terms\nof making more use of renewables."},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"So really right across the spectrum,"},"421":{"dur":4,"text":"success in
