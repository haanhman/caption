that?"},"539":{"dur":5,"text":"Why was she saying to the political appointees\nin charge of the FDA \u201cBy trying to force"},"545":{"dur":3,"text":"the conclusion,\u201d it\u2019s because they were\ndoing just that."},"548":{"dur":5,"text":"In the policy which came out ignoring Linda\nCall, ignoring all the technical experts at"},"553":{"dur":5,"text":"the agency, they claimed that the
