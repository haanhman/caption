rocket\nscience."},"102":{"dur":1,"text":"Some of it was pretty obvious."},"104":{"dur":4,"text":"We, we had a really terribly crumbling\nphysical infrastructure."},"108":{"dur":3,"text":"Most of Yale was built in the inter-war\nperiod, between World War I and"},"111":{"dur":0,"text":"World War II."},"113":{"dur":2,"text":"And in collegiate gothic style."},"116":{"dur":4,"text":"And had not been

condition."},"128":{"dur":4,"text":"And that, that sort of decaying look of\nthe campus."},"132":{"dur":2,"text":"And the problematic nature of the city of\nNew Haven,"},"135":{"dur":2,"text":"which at the time was very high in\nunemployment and"},"137":{"dur":4,"text":"the whole central business district,\nessentially one third vacant."},"142":{"dur":3,"text":"Where the crime was, was rampant at

universities."},"161":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, investment in both infrastructure\nand the city were just"},"165":{"dur":3,"text":"looming large as powerful things that\nneeded to be addressed."},"169":{"dur":3,"text":"And then there were a couple of things I\nsaw at that time,"},"172":{"dur":2,"text":"that were longer term that turned out to\nbe major themes."},"175":{"dur":3,"text":"One was internationalization, as Eugene\nlaid out, and thank you,"},"178":{"dur":3,"text":"by the way, Garth, for that generous\nundeserved introduction."},"181":{"dur":3,"text":"But one was internationalization because I"},"185":{"dur":2,"text":"just thought the world was changing and\nglobalization."},"187":{"dur":3,"text":"People weren't using the word yet in 1993."},"191":{"dur":3,"text":"But but, but the phenomenon was, was\nclear."},"195":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, we needed Tom Friedman to give us\nthe words, but we, but"},"198":{"dur":1,"text":"we had the song somehow."},"200":{"dur":1,"text":"And, and and"},"201":{"dur":4,"text":"then the other was redressing the balance\nof Yale's strengths and weaknesses."},"205":{"dur":7,"text":"That is, we had we were in danger of\nbecoming so tilted towards the humanities,"},"212":{"dur":6,"text":"the social science and the professions and\nweaker and weaker in science medicine and"},"219":{"dur":3,"text":"engineering that I felt we needed to sorta\nput more balance into that mix."},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"A lesson, by the way, which

initiative."},"234":{"dur":5,"text":"First really major step we're taking\ntoward urban citizenship in New Haven,"},"240":{"dur":2,"text":"which was a, a major project."},"242":{"dur":1,"text":">> And tell us about that."},"243":{"dur":4,"text":"What did you learn about working with the,\nthe, the city at that time and"},"248":{"dur":4,"text":"also pitching that to your board and\ntrying to get buy-in for that effort."},"252":{"dur":1,"text":">> Yeah, the board was there."},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"Because the board was very nervous about\nthe,"},"256":{"dur":4,"text":"the, the, the sort of reputation of New\nHaven as a dangerous place, and so"},"260":{"dur":5,"text":"they were entirely on board with, with\ninvesting significantly in the city."},"266":{"dur":3,"text":"It was more a question of selling the, the\nfaculty and the and,"},"269":{"dur":3,"text":"and the local constituents who felt you\nknow, if Yale starts spending money to"},"273":{"dur":3,"text":"help fix New Haven this was like pouring\nmoney down the drain."},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"And, and so we didn't start by spending\nmoney."},"279":{"dur":2,"text":"We started by, by doing other things."},"281":{"dur":0,"text":"The, the idea was."},"283":{"dur":6,"text":"It, we had a 200 plus year history of town\ngown rivalry, ill will."},"290":{"dur":4,"text":"Yale had, was this rich ivory tower\ninstitution in a poor and declining"},"294":{"dur":3,"text":"industrial city that, you know, that had\nbeen a prosperous industrial city, but"},"297":{"dur":4,"text":"it was, was in, was in a great decline as\nthe manufacturing industry went away."},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"Shirt-making industry went to the south."},"304":{"dur":3,"text":"The munitions industry at the end of the\nVietnam War basically shut down."},"307":{"dur":1,"text":"And there was nothing left."},"309":{"dur":1,"text":"Really nothing left literally."},"310":{"dur":1,"text":"It was a awful."},"312":{"dur":4,"text":"So so we had to we, we, we needed to."},"317":{"dur":3,"text":"We, you know, we knew we, economic\ndevelopment was gonna be a major theme."},"320":{"dur":1,"text":"But we couldn't just jump into that."},"321":{"dur":1,"text":"We were just, we were not trusted."},"323":{"dur":3,"text":"So the issue was winning the bona fide's\nof community leaders."},"327":{"dur":1,"text":"Of the political apparatus and"},"329":{"dur":5,"text":"of the other community organizations in\nthe neighborhoods and in the clergy who"},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"have important political influence\nparticularly in the black community."},"336":{"dur":6,"text":"So we, we, we set about it by with\nvolunteerism and really mobilizing."},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"The, what was already happening,"},"345":{"dur":3,"text":"but organizing it in much more systematic\nways."},"349":{"dur":4,"text":"So basically, I made, I had every dean of\nevery school rec, you know,"},"353":{"dur":3,"text":"told that it's part of your job\ndescription to have urban outreach and"},"357":{"dur":2,"text":"to get your students and faculty involved."},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"So the drama school is doing improv\ntheaters in near by neighborhood and"},"363":{"dur":3,"text":"the forestry environmental studies schools\nplanting trees and"},"366":{"dur":4,"text":"creating pocket parks in neighborhoods,\nand, and we could go on and on."},"370":{"dur":4,"text":"All kinds of, of initiatives on parts of\nof students and faculty."},"374":{"dur":4,"text":"And, and after a couple years that, it\nreally helped, we, we were really kind of,"},"379":{"dur":1,"text":"beginning to win the hearts and minds."},"381":{"dur":3,"text":"Hey, Yale's different now, it's really\nengaged in helping the city and"},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"then being a participating citizen."},"386":{"dur":6,"text":"And then it was only at that point that\nthe mayor came to me and said, you know,"},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"we need to fix the downtown and the only,\nthe only entity in the place with cap,"},"396":{"dur":5,"text":"with the capital and the vision and the\nself-interest to make that work is Yale."},"402":{"dur":4,"text":"So, with my blessing, go ahead and buy\ndowntown, and redevelop it."},"406":{"dur":3,"text":"And I mean, that was amazing, just from a\nhistorical point of view,"},"409":{"dur":1,"text":"that we had that opportunity."},"410":{"dur":1,"text":"But it worked out really well."},"412":{"dur":1,"text":"And we've got great retail."},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"Great, great food, you know,"},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"really terrific restaurants in the\ndowntown New Haven now."},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"It's actually, truthfully, I hate to say\nthis, but"},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"it's actually nicer than Harvard Square."},"422":{"dur":3,"text":">> [LAUGH] We won't compare."},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"But you know, I think one thing that you\nwere saying Rick,"},"429":{"dur":4,"text":"that you know, this, this idea of how you\nwork with the faculty at your school."},"434":{"dur":1,"text":">> Yeah."},"435":{"dur":2,"text":">> I think is really interesting."},"437":{"dur":1,"text":"Faculty are, are, generally tenured."},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"You can't fire them."},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"You can't force them to do what you want."},"442":{"dur":3,"text":"So, how did you go about creating a vision\nand"},"446":{"dur":4,"text":"getting them to, to really have a\nconsensus on that?"},"450":{"dur":2,"text":">> Well this, it, all, all, this is all\ntrue for"},"452":{"dur":3,"text":"almost any constituency where you need\ntheir support."},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, this would be true to any of you\nwho are leading organizations and"},"458":{"dur":3,"text":"you wanna keep the, you know, your senior\nstaff with you,"},"462":{"dur":1,"text":"you wanna keep the employees with you."},"463":{"dur":3,"text":"Basically, a leader needs to articulate a\nvision."},"467":{"dur":4,"text":"He needs to be clearly and coherently\narticulated."},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"It needs to be tested with key people at"},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"the beginning before it's widely\ncommunicated."},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"But then it's communicate, communicate,\ncommunicate."},"479":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean it's just getting the message out\nand, and going and"},"483":{"dur":3,"text":"patiently talking about it with skeptical\naudiences."},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"Answering questions."},"487":{"dur":4,"text":"Being, being open and responsive to\nsuggestions and change."},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"But also not yielding on the core vision."},"494":{"dur":0,"text":"And, you know, one,"},"495":{"dur":3,"text":"one of the great things about faculty is\nthey're basically rational."},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"And, and even though they're very\nindependent."},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, persuading is possible, actually."},"504":{"dur":0,"text":">> Mm-hm.\n>> If you have,"},"505":{"dur":4,"text":"if you, you know, if it's a compelling\nargument eventually, you'll win."},"509":{"dur":4,"text":"And, and, that, I think that's, that's,\nthat was the way, you know, for"},"514":{"dur":5,"text":"things like, you know, investing in the\ninfrastructure, you know, investing in"},"519":{"dur":5,"text":"the city and internationalization, all of\nthose strategies."},"524":{"dur":3,"text":"Really became I think a pretty common\nconsensus with time,"},"528":{"dur":4,"text":"patience, explanation, lots of meetings\nwith groups to talk it through."},"532":{"dur":3,"text":">> Hm, the on, on the topic of\ninternationalization."},"536":{"dur":4,"text":"You did face some push back on the\ndecision by the University to"},"540":{"dur":4,"text":"open a campus in Singapore in partnership\nwith the

stands on human\nrights in,"},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"in conflict with the way Yale felt."},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"[CROSSTALK] And so how did you make that\ndecision to really put"},"561":{"dur":5,"text":"yourself behind that decision, when you\nknew there was going to be public outcry?"},"567":{"dur":3,"text":">> Right, well the si, so the initiative\nto start a liberal

position for"},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"nearly 16 years."},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"And and it was, it was a kind of"},"585":{"dur":4,"text":"a capstone of a major effort to do a lot\nof other things, globally."},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"Lots of exchange programs."},"591":{"dur":4,"text":"Research facilities in China, all kinds of\nother things have preceded this."},"595":{"dur":4,"text":"So, the actual internationalization battle\nfor hearts and"},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"minds within the university had already\nbeen won."},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"What, what hit the nerve of some of our\nfaculty, and"},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"I, I hate, leaders will always say this."},"608":{"dur":3,"text":"But it was a really small minority of\npeople who were"},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"really exorcised about this."},"612":{"dur":4,"text":"The majority, as one, as one of my key\nadvisors,"},"616":{"dur":4,"text":"one faculty member I've greatly respect\nsaid to me about this before it blew up."},"621":{"dur":1,"text":"He said."},"622":{"dur":4,"text":"He said you know the thing is you've got\n15% of the people wildly enthusiastic"},"627":{"dur":3,"text":"about this and 5% are, are just really\nupset about it."},"631":{"dur":4,"text":"And the remaining 80% actually don't know\nor care or just totally indifferent."},"635":{"dur":4,"text":"He said, what you have to avoid is a\nsituation where the 5% somehow get"},"640":{"dur":2,"text":"an issue where they can bring, where they\ncan persuade the 80%."},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"Well that was so pressured because it\nturned out to be what happened."},"646":{"dur":5,"text":"The, the, the fa, the, these faculty\nmembers tried to pass a resolution"},"651":{"dur":4,"text":"that said we, you know, we support full\nhuman

they\ncensured our doing."},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was not a vote of no confidence in\nour doing it."},"664":{"dur":5,"text":"It was very clever, and, and you know, so\nwe took a few lumps in

thought that was an environment where it\njust wasn't ready for, for this kind of,"},"716":{"dur":5,"text":"of really free, free ranging intellectual\nbattles and questioning
