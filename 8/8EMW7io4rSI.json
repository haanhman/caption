analytics team."},"95":{"dur":2,"text":"And people analytics\nis an analytical team"},"97":{"dur":2,"text":"in the people ops\norganization here,"},"100":{"dur":2,"text":"where the goal is\nto try to ensure"},"102":{"dur":1,"text":"that all the decisions\nabout people--"},"104":{"dur":3,"text":"employees, future\nemployees-- are data-driven."},"107":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, I had the\nopportunity of joining"},"109":{"dur":1,"text":"when the team was\nrelatively small,"},"111":{"dur":3,"text":"which meant that I got to\nwork on a ton of cool stuff"},"114":{"dur":3,"text":"over the years, learning\nabout things like what"},"117":{"dur":3,"text":"makes a manager effective, how\ndo you build productive teams,"},"121":{"dur":2,"text":"what drives attrition."},"123":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, in 2010, we developed\na program called Base Camp."},"127":{"dur":3,"text":"It was an internal\nMBA-like training program"},"130":{"dur":1,"text":"within people

really"},"137":{"dur":1,"text":"interested in this space."},"139":{"dur":3,"text":"But this meant I could pause\nand research and understand"},"142":{"dur":1,"text":"why some of the\nthings I'd arrived"},"144":{"dur":4,"text":"at through trial and error\nover time had been effective."},"148":{"dur":3,"text":"So as a side note, I can\nhonestly say that Google for

which"},"158":{"dur":3,"text":"was at a people ops off-site\nin Monterrey, in the very first"},"162":{"dur":2,"text":"row sat my future husband."},"165":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can really say without\nthe Data Visualization course"},"167":{"dur":3,"text":"here at Google, I\nwouldn't have these"},"170":{"dur":4,"text":"or the third that's on the\nway-- super life-changing."},"175":{"dur":3,"text":"But back on Google, there\nwas broader interest,"},"178":{"dur":2,"text":"we were finding, in the\nData Visualization course."},"181":{"dur":1,"text":"So we actually ended\nup rolling it out"},"183":{"dur":2,"text":"across Google, which meant\nI got the opportunity"},"186":{"dur":4,"text":"to travel to offices in London\nand Dublin and Zurich and train"},"191":{"dur":3,"text":"trainers and teach courses."},"194":{"dur":1,"text":"I also got a chance\nto teach courses"},"195":{"dur":3,"text":"across a number of US\noffices, including many right"},"199":{"dur":2,"text":"here in Mountain View."},"201":{"dur":1,"text":"One of the things that\nwas interesting for me"},"203":{"dur":3,"text":"was to see salespeople\nand engineers sitting side"},"206":{"dur":2,"text":"by side in those courses."},"209":{"dur":3,"text":"I came to realize that the\nskills needed in this area"},"212":{"dur":1,"text":"were fundamental."},"214":{"dur":2,"text":"They weren't specific\nto any given role."},"216":{"dur":2,"text":"They also weren't\nspecific to Google."},"219":{"dur":3,"text":"Over time, other organizations\nstarted reaching out to me,"},"223":{"dur":3,"text":"wanting me to go teach their\nteams and their organizations"},"226":{"dur":2,"text":"how to communicate\neffectively with data."},"229":{"dur":2,"text":"So over the course of\nthe past couple of years,"},"231":{"dur":2,"text":"I've had the opportunity\nto work with hundreds"},"233":{"dur":3,"text":"of different teams across\nmany different organizations."},"237":{"dur":2,"text":"And usually this takes\nthe form of workshops,"},"239":{"dur":3,"text":"where I'll spend half a\nday or a full day teaching"},"243":{"dur":3,"text":"foundational lessons on\ncommunicating with data."},"246":{"dur":2,"text":"And oftentimes what I'll\ndo is solicit examples"},"249":{"dur":1,"text":"from the group ahead\nof time, and we'll"},"250":{"dur":1,"text":"go through the\nlessons, and then we'll"},"252":{"dur":3,"text":"spend time talking about that\ngroup's specific examples."},"256":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'll go through my\nmakeovers as one potential path"},"260":{"dur":2,"text":"that leverages the lessons\nthat we've covered."},"262":{"dur":1,"text":"So I thought it might\nbe cool to take you"},"264":{"dur":1,"text":"through a couple of these."},"265":{"dur":1,"text":"We won't go through\nthem in a lot of detail."},"266":{"dur":2,"text":"We'll just give you a\nvisual sense of what"},"268":{"dur":2,"text":"you can learn in the book."},"271":{"dur":3,"text":"So this first example is one\nfrom the philanthropic sector."},"274":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's a foundation that\nwanted to start a conversation"},"278":{"dur":2,"text":"on shifting spending from\nnon-initiative, which"},"280":{"dur":4,"text":"is the big, cream-colored\nsegment at the top left,"},"284":{"dur":3,"text":"to higher education,\nthat tiny, blue segment."},"288":{"dur":1,"text":"So in this case, we change\nfrom the pie chart--"},"290":{"dur":3,"text":"we've already talked about my\nviews there-- to this, right?"},"293":{"dur":1,"text":"If we want to shift\nspending, let's"},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"say we want to shift\nspending and start"},"297":{"dur":1,"text":"a conversation about that."},"299":{"dur":2,"text":"Use visual cues to draw our\naudience's attention to where"},"301":{"dur":1,"text":"we want them to pay it."},"303":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's look another example."},"305":{"dur":4,"text":"This is one from an IT group who\ncouldn't believe that people,"},"309":{"dur":2,"text":"after looking at this graph,\nweren't doing anything"},"312":{"dur":1,"text":"with this information."},"313":{"dur":2,"text":"Why weren't they acting\nupon this information?"},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"Here, it gets totally\nlost in the graph, right?"},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"There's no story to\nbring it to life."},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, the backstory was-- if\nwe stare at this long enough,"},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"we can see there's a\ngap starting to form out"},"326":{"dur":2,"text":"on the right-hand side, where\nthe number of tickets coming in"},"328":{"dur":2,"text":"are exceeding the number\nthat are being processed."},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, the backstory was they'd\nlost a couple of resources."},"334":{"dur":1,"text":"They were understaffed."},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"And they really wanted to\nhire a couple more people."},"337":{"dur":2,"text":"And they couldn't understand\nwhy nobody was doing that"},"339":{"dur":1,"text":"based on this graph."},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"So in this case, we\nchanged from that to this,"},"344":{"dur":2,"text":"again making that\ncall to action clear,"},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"annotating the context\ndirectly on the graph,"},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"drawing attention to\nthat gap that's forming"},"350":{"dur":1,"text":"on the right-hand side."},"352":{"dur":1,"text":"So I've got one more of these."},"354":{"dur":2,"text":"This is an example from\na small organization who"},"356":{"dur":3,"text":"was recognizing that their\nregional sale composition had"},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"shifted over time\nand wanting to have"},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"a conversation about what some\nof the implications of that"},"366":{"dur":0,"text":"were."},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, this is an interesting one."},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"I've used this a number\nof times in workshops."},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"And when people\nflip to this graph,"},"374":{"dur":3,"text":"there's often a sort of\nimmediate, negative, visceral"},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"reaction, which is\nsomething we want to try"},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"to avoid in our audiences."},"382":{"dur":1,"text":"And now, I can't\nimagine all of them"},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"were Packers fans\nlike my husband."},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"These are sort of\nBroncos colors, right?"},"388":{"dur":3,"text":"But rather that this graph\nwas unnecessarily confusing."},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, the beautiful thing here is\nthere are some clear take-aways"},"394":{"dur":1,"text":"articulated at the bottom."},"396":{"dur":1,"text":"It's just almost\nimpossible to know"},"397":{"dur":3,"text":"where to look in the data for\nevidence of those take-aways."},"401":{"dur":3,"text":"So in this case, changed\nfrom that to this,"},"404":{"dur":2,"text":"making the focus on the\nchange, tying the text"},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"directly to the data,\nboth through proximity"},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"and similarity of color."},"411":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, one thing to\nnote is these examples"},"414":{"dur":1,"text":"cross many different industries."},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"I mentioned before that these\nskills are not role-specific."},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"They're also not really\nindustry-specific."},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"Rather, they're foundational."},"423":{"dur":2,"text":"And over time, through\nall of the workshops"},"425":{"dur":1,"text":"that I've taught over\nthe past few years,"},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"I've codified these lessons."},"429":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's what ultimately\nled to this, my book."},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'm super excited to be\nable to share with you today"},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"a couple quick lessons\nfrom my new book,"},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Storytelling with Data.\""},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're going to talk\ntoday about two key lessons,"},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"first off, focusing attention,\nand secondly, telling a story."},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"We want to draw one\nimportant distinction"},"449":{"dur":1,"text":"at this point, which\nis the distinction"},"451":{"dur":4,"text":"between exploratory analysis\nand explanatory analysis."},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"So exploratory analysis,\nyou perhaps start off"},"457":{"dur":1,"text":"with a question or\nhypothesis, or you're just"},"459":{"dur":1,"text":"digging through\nyour data, trying"},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"to understand\nwhat's interesting,"},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"what can I learn about this\ndata that somebody else"},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"might care about?"},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"Once you've identified\nthat interesting thing,"},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"then we move into\nexplanatory space."},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"That is where you have\nsomething specific"},"474":{"dur":3,"text":"you want to communicate\nto somebody specific."},"478":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's this latter space we\nwant to keep in mind today."},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"And when it comes to\nexplanatory analysis,"},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"these lessons become more\nimportant than perhaps"},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"any others-- first off,\nthinking about where"},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"you want your audience\nto pay attention"},"492":{"dur":3,"text":"and doing things on purpose\nto make that happen,"},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"and then secondly, never\nsimply showing data, but rather"},"499":{"dur":3,"text":"making data a pivotal point\nin an overarching story."},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"So we'll talk briefly\nthrough each of these."},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"First off, focusing\nattention-- I"},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"can recall a time at\nGoogle where I was working"},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"on the Project Oxygen study."},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"Quick show of hands--\nhow many people"},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"are familiar with\nProject Oxygen?"},"515":{"dur":0,"text":"Most people in the room."},"516":{"dur":3,"text":"So Project Oxygen was a study\nled by my colleague Neil Patel."},"520":{"dur":3,"text":"And the goal really was\nto try to understand,"},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"on a mathematical,\nstatistical level,"},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"what makes managers effective."},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"One of the challenges\nthat we encountered"},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"was, after the study was done,\ncommunicating the results of it"},"533":{"dur":3,"text":"to a very mixed audience, where\nwe had both engineers, who"},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"had a great desire for detail--\nthey wanted to understand"},"540":{"dur":1,"text":"the methodology,\nthey wanted to be"},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"convinced of the\nrobustness of the analysis."},"543":{"dur":1,"text":"At the same time,\nwe were also wanting"},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"to communicate to\nsales managers,"},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"for example, who were mostly\nless concerned with methodology"},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"and more concerned about\nwhat's in it for me."},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"How should I act\ndifferently based on this?"},"555":{"dur":3,"text":"And so what we found was by\nreally being careful about how"},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"we focused attention, we could\npreserve a lot of that detail"},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"but push it to the background\nand make the meta-point pop"},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"out so that it was clear."},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's talk a little\nbit about how"},"569":{"dur":4,"text":"people see to get into more of\nthis how we focus attention."},"573":{"dur":3,"text":"So here's a super-simplified\npicture of that process."},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"On the left-hand side, you\nhave light refracting off"},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"This gets captured by our eyes."},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"We don't fully\nsee with our eyes."},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"Rather, most of what we\nthink of as visual processing"},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"takes place in our brains."},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, in the brains there\nare a few types of memory"},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"that are important to\nunderstand as we're designing"},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"visual communications."},"593":{"dur":3,"text":"We'll talk about one of them\ntoday, which is iconic memory."},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"Iconic memory is\nsuper short-term."},"599":{"dur":1,"text":"It's shorter than\nshort-term memory,"},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"and information stays there\nfor fractions of a second"},"603":{"dur":3,"text":"before it gets forwarded on\nto our short-term memory."},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"The really cool thing\nabout iconic memory"},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"is that it's tuned to a\nspecific set of what we"},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"call pre-attentive attributes."},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"So let's actually pause here\nand do a quick exercise."},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"So in a moment, I'm going\nto put a bunch of numbers"},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"up on the screen."},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"What I'd like you all\nto do as fast as you can"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"is count the number\nof 3s that you see."},"625":{"dur":1,"text":"We're going to count 3s."},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"When you know the\nanswer, shout it out."},"629":{"dur":1,"text":"It is a race."},"631":{"dur":1,"text":"You would like to win."},"632":{"dur":1,"text":"Ready, set, go!"},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"All right, six is\nthe correct answer."},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"This took a bit of\ntime, though, right?"},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"You had to physically\nread through these four"},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"lines of text,\nlook for a 3, which"},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"is kind of a complicated shape."},"652":{"dur":1,"text":"Watch what a\ndifferent exercise it"},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"becomes when I make\none tiny change."},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"Don't have time to think."},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"Don't have time to blink."},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"Suddenly there are six\n3s in front of you."},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"This is so apparent\nso quickly because I'm"},"665":{"dur":1,"text":"leveraging your iconic memory."},"667":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm using the\npre-attentive attribute"},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"of intensity of\ncolor, in this case,"},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"to make the 3s the one\nthing that stand out as"},"674":{"dur":1,"text":"different from the rest."},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, this is hugely critical,\nbecause what this means is"},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"our pre-attentive attributes,\nif we use them strategically,"},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"can help enable us\nto get our audience"},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"to see what we want them\nto see before they even"},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"know they're seeing it."},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"Here are the attributes."},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"I won't read through\nall of these,"},"693":{"dur":3,"text":"but notice as your eyes\nscan across the screen"},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"how they're just\ndrawn to the one"},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"within each group that's\ndifferent from the rest."},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"You don't really have to\nconsciously look for it."},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, one thing to know\nabout the attributes"},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"is people tend to associate\nquantitative values"},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"with some but not others."},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"For example, most people\nwill consider a long line"},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"to represent a greater\nvalue than a short line."},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"It's one of the\nreasons bar charts are"},"717":{"dur":1,"text":"intuitive for us to read."},"718":{"dur":3,"text":"But we don't think of hue,\nfor example, in the same way."},"722":{"dur":1,"text":"If I ask you which is\ngreater, red or blue,"},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"it's not really a\nmeaningful question."},"726":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is important\nbecause it tells us"},"728":{"dur":1,"text":"which of the\nattributes can be used"},"730":{"dur":3,"text":"in code quantitative information\nand which should be used"},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"as categorical differentiators."},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"Now as you can perhaps imagine,\npre-attentive attributes"},"738":{"dur":4,"text":"become huge tools for focusing\nour audience's attention when"},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"it comes to visualizing data."},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"So here's some sort of generic\ndata from our annual customer"},"747":{"dur":0,"text":"survey."},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"We can see how we've fared\nacross a number of dimensions."},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"Notice how without other visual\ncues, this becomes very much"},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"like the count-the-3s\nexample again."},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"We have to look at this\ndata, read through it,"},"761":{"dur":3,"text":"figure out what might be\nimportant to pay attention to."},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"Whereas if I'm the one\ncommunicating this data,"},"766":{"dur":3,"text":"I should have already done\nthat for you, in which case"},"770":{"dur":2,"text":"I can use some pre-attentive\nattributes, perhaps paired"},"772":{"dur":2,"text":"with some explanatory text,\nto draw your attention very"},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"quickly to one part\nof the story, right?"},"778":{"dur":2,"text":"Price and convenience--\nwe're doing awesome here."},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's pause and\ncelebrate our success."},"783":{"dur":1,"text":"Or I can use this\nsame broad strategy"},"784":{"dur":2,"text":"to draw your attention to\na totally different place"},"787":{"dur":1,"text":"in the data."},"788":{"dur":1,"text":"But we're struggling\nwhen it comes"},"789":{"dur":1,"text":"to relationship and brand."},"791":{"dur":4,"text":"How can we positively\nimpact these areas?"},"795":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, there's a test I like to\nemploy in trying to figure out"},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"whether you're using your\npre-attentive attributes"},"801":{"dur":1,"text":"strategically."},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"And that is the Where\nAre Your Eyes Drawn Test,"},"805":{"dur":2,"text":"where you look away from your\nvisual and look back at it,"},"808":{"dur":1,"text":"or close your eyes\nand look back at it,"},"810":{"dur":3,"text":"and just notice where\nyour eyes land first."},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"Because it's probably\nwhere your audience's eyes"},"815":{"dur":1,"text":"will land as well."},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"So I thought we'd do this\nwith a series of pictures"},"820":{"dur":1,"text":"and just talk about\nthe implications"},"821":{"dur":1,"text":"for our visual designs."},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm going to put a series\nof different pictures up there."},"825":{"dur":1,"text":"When I put the

stick with us in a\nway that we can later recall"},"1323":{"dur":2,"text":"and retell to somebody else."},"1325":{"dur":1,"text":"So we want to think\nabout how we can

the story,"},"1342":{"dur":1,"text":"we want to think back\nto those same things"},"1344":{"dur":2,"text":"that we talked about with\nRed Riding Hood-- the plot,"},"1346":{"dur":1,"text":"the twists, the ending."},"1348":{"dur":3,"text":"The plot becomes what context\nis essential for your audience."},"1352":{"dur":1,"text":"What do they need\nto know in order"},"1353":{"dur":1,"text":"to be in the right\nframe of mind for what"},"1355":{"dur":2,"text":"you're going to tell them?"},"1357":{"dur":2,"text":"Then the twists-- what's\ninteresting about the data"},"1360":{"dur":1,"text":"and what

should be working\nto make that something as"},"1383":{"dur":2,"text":"clear as possible."},"1385":{"dur":2,"text":"Because if we simply show\ndata, as we saw in that

thing."},"1393":{"dur":2,"text":"But if we ask for\naction, our audience"},"1396":{"dur":1,"text":"has to respond to that."},"1397":{"dur":2,"text":"And even if they disagree,\nit starts a

example."},"1407":{"dur":2,"text":"So in this scenario,\nimagine that you just"},"1409":{"dur":2,"text":"wrapped up a summer\nlearning program on science."},"1411":{"dur":3,"text":"The goal was to get
