And so what we're going to"},"52":{"dur":4,"text":"do is basically dive into talking about how we began"},"56":{"dur":4,"text":"utilizing Sites at Penn State for these online courses that"},"60":{"dur":4,"text":"we were teaching. Do you want to add before..."},"64":{"dur":4,"text":"Audrey: Do any of you use Sites at Penn State?"},"68":{"dur":4,"text":"And did you understand that it's actually Word Press"},"72":{"dur":4,"text":"offered through Penn State? Okay."},"76":{"dur":4,"text":"Bert: So I don't know whether my mic is working. I can sort of maybe hear, but anyway"},"80":{"dur":4,"text":"hopefully it is working somewhat and"},"84":{"dur":4,"text":"so yeah, so I don't think I have anything to add to that so we can jump in."},"88":{"dur":4,"text":"Christine: Okay. So the first thing we"},"92":{"dur":4,"text":"wanted to talk about is really what are our objectives in kind of"},"96":{"dur":4,"text":"designing and implementing these courses. Like where did this even come from?"},"100":{"dur":4,"text":"And so basically for me, I have been teaching literacy education courses"},"104":{"dur":4,"text":"and there was this need to teach an EDTHP 115A"},"108":{"dur":4,"text":"which is critical issues in education."},"112":{"dur":4,"text":"It's normally taught in the fall and spring semesters, and so there's been this really big push"},"116":{"dur":4,"text":"to teach online courses. And I'm actually a new faculty member. Last year was my"},"120":{"dur":4,"text":"first year, this is my second year, and I thought okay I might as well give it a shot."},"124":{"dur":4,"text":"Right? I have some experience teaching online courses"},"128":{"dur":4,"text":"in my previous life. I've also developed online professional development"},"132":{"dur":4,"text":"and I thought let's just give it a shot this summer. So I volunteered to jump in and try"},"136":{"dur":4,"text":"this. And so basically as a result of"},"140":{"dur":4,"text":"kind of going through this, I really - anything especially with education"},"144":{"dur":4,"text":"but particularly with issues that deal with these critical issues in education"},"148":{"dur":4,"text":"I wanted a two way dialog. And I felt that online courses typically don't offer"},"153":{"dur":4,"text":"that. What I've seen in the past, both in previous"},"157":{"dur":4,"text":"courses that I've taught and also just through Angel, it looks"},"161":{"dur":4,"text":"almost like this kind of content that people just kind of have to scroll through"},"165":{"dur":4,"text":"and just kind of do on their own either asynchronously or"},"169":{"dur":4,"text":"synchronously if there are those components. But that's not what I wanted. I wanted"},"173":{"dur":4,"text":"them to react to some of these issues that we have in education, because some of"},"177":{"dur":4,"text":"these are education majors and some were not. And so this is a course that"},"181":{"dur":4,"text":"is actually fulfills some general education requirements as well, so we have some"},"185":{"dur":4,"text":"students that I wanted to hear their perspectives. How did they feel about"},"189":{"dur":4,"text":"you know, racism in schools and how did they feel about some of these other issues"},"193":{"dur":4,"text":"and I really needed it to be a two way dialog. And so reality was"},"197":{"dur":4,"text":"I needed to make sure that I included I know I wanted to include discussion prompts of some kind."},"201":{"dur":4,"text":"I knew that I needed it to be this kind of dialog"},"205":{"dur":4,"text":"going back and forth between the students. I didn't want just this touch and go."},"209":{"dur":4,"text":"Like just I'm going to do this activity, I'm going to do this activity and then there's really"},"213":{"dur":4,"text":"no kind of interaction among students and especially with me. I wanted"},"217":{"dur":4,"text":"to have that dialog. And so I met with some of the"},"221":{"dur":4,"text":"people at our campus, and I"},"225":{"dur":4,"text":"kept saying okay this is what I want and we initially decided on maybe like using some Voicethread."},"229":{"dur":4,"text":"So okay, we're going to use Angel, maybe we'll use some Yammer for some discussion threads,"},"233":{"dur":4,"text":"and post those, but they were saying maybe we want to use something like Voicethread."},"237":{"dur":4,"text":"And that really didn't fulfill my need. And so at this point I was kind of"},"241":{"dur":4,"text":"I was kind of lost and then talked to someone else who said why don't you try"},"245":{"dur":4,"text":"let me show you Sites at Penn State. And so that's kind of where I"},"249":{"dur":4,"text":"was in terms of getting to these objectives that I wanted to get across."},"253":{"dur":4,"text":"Bert: So, I don't know whether my mic is working"},"257":{"dur":4,"text":"or not. I know that you guys can hear me. I don't know if they're recording this and whether it's necessary for me to be close"},"261":{"dur":4,"text":"to that one or not. Maybe someone will tell me that. But I think what's a little"},"265":{"dur":4,"text":"bit different about what we're presenting this morning is that Christine and I are coming from totally different"},"270":{"dur":4,"text":"areas, okay? So I'm a faculty member in the Department of"},"274":{"dur":4,"text":"Animal Science, and I'm teaching the Introduction to Equine Science course."},"278":{"dur":4,"text":"I've been teaching this class now for five years."},"282":{"dur":4,"text":"And it started as an online sort of course."},"286":{"dur":4,"text":"And I'll get into some of that history in a minute. It fits within our"},"290":{"dur":4,"text":"minor that we have within our department, which is an Equine Science minor and it"},"294":{"dur":4,"text":"is a prescribed course in that minor, so it's required at the beginning of that"},"298":{"dur":4,"text":"and so we have a number of students that want to take that. Our minor is"},"302":{"dur":4,"text":"relatively large for our college, but not a huge one, so we have between 100 and"},"306":{"dur":4,"text":"and 150 students in the minor that we're trying to satisfy."},"310":{"dur":4,"text":"My goal in this class was to get students on a level playing"},"314":{"dur":4,"text":"ground for the other courses in the Equine Science minor that we're offering."},"318":{"dur":4,"text":"We have sort of middle level management and production classes. We have advanced level"},"322":{"dur":4,"text":"management and production classes and with horses, we have students coming"},"326":{"dur":4,"text":"in with a wide range of different experiences. Maybe they grew up riding"},"330":{"dur":4,"text":"horses, maybe they've worked for their veterinarian, maybe they have no experience"},"334":{"dur":4,"text":"with horses whatsoever, and this class needed to sort of fulfill the needs of"},"338":{"dur":4,"text":"all those wide range of different students."},"342":{"dur":4,"text":"My objectives, and these are outside of the learning objectives, I could show you the syllabus"},"346":{"dur":4,"text":"and show you my learning objectives, but the thing that I had is I"},"350":{"dur":4,"text":"wanted to enhance participation, I wanted to enhance"},"354":{"dur":4,"text":"communication. Those were things that I really wanted to emphasize"},"358":{"dur":4,"text":"in my students in addition to getting this basic knowledge in the area"},"362":{"dur":4,"text":"of Equine Science. And I knew that that was going to be a challenge."},"366":{"dur":4,"text":"through online learning, but I like challenges, so I was excited about"},"370":{"dur":4,"text":"sort of going at this. I also really"},"374":{"dur":4,"text":"have enjoyed my experience with Sites at Penn State because of the"},"378":{"dur":4,"text":"creativity it allowed me to have as an instructor. When I go into the classroom,"},"382":{"dur":4,"text":"whether it's online or I'm lecturing in front of a group, I want to try"},"386":{"dur":4,"text":"to be creative. I like being creative. It's part of being a scientist, to be honest with you."},"390":{"dur":4,"text":"And so Sites at Penn State has allowed me to do that"},"394":{"dur":4,"text":"more so than any other tool I've used before. So we'll show you guys"},"398":{"dur":4,"text":"a little about that."},"402":{"dur":4,"text":"Christine: So in terms of coming to this solution as I shared with you guys"},"406":{"dur":4,"text":"I met with some of our instructional designers at Penn State Berks"},"411":{"dur":4,"text":"Amy Roche and Mary Ann Mengel and again the first"},"415":{"dur":4,"text":"person I met with we kind of worked through some of the issues. She gave me some really great"},"419":{"dur":4,"text":"ideas and I can't even tell you how supportive they've been. And then Mary Ann"},"423":{"dur":4,"text":"was the person I sat down with and she said let me show you Sites. Let me show you what there is to offer"},"427":{"dur":4,"text":"with this. And so again as I shared we were initially talking about this Angel"},"431":{"dur":4,"text":"with Voicethread and that kind of you know it was like okay"},"435":{"dur":4,"text":"if this is what I have then this is what i'll use, but I tend to like to be"},"439":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm an education instructor. So I have my students"},"443":{"dur":4,"text":"up and moving and I have them doing multiple things all the time."},"447":{"dur":4,"text":"And I'm never just in the front of the room talking to them for any length of time. Maybe"},"451":{"dur":4,"text":"15 minutes at the max in terms of me lecturing to students. So I"},"455":{"dur":4,"text":"if that's what I had to deal with then I would have done it, but I really wanted"},"459":{"dur":4,"text":"to kind of simulate what happens in my classroom and so"},"463":{"dur":4,"text":"I realized that Sites allowed me to kind of get them into different places"},"467":{"dur":4,"text":"and to different areas and yet allow me to kind of draw them back in"},"471":{"dur":4,"text":"and focus on the things I wanted them to focus in on. And so"},"475":{"dur":4,"text":"this was Sites was again introduced but also"},"479":{"dur":4,"text":"I realized that it met the needs of me having this two way dialog. And I'll show you a little"},"483":{"dur":4,"text":"bit why, I'm not going to kind of go back and forth yet, because I think that"},"487":{"dur":4,"text":"there's plenty to show you when I do, but I think the idea with Sites is that there's always"},"491":{"dur":4,"text":"an opportunity for students to respond to anything. So in terms of the content"},"495":{"dur":4,"text":"in terms of video, in terms of anything on there"},"499":{"dur":4,"text":"they can kind of just start their own discussion and start to kind of react to"},"503":{"dur":4,"text":"whatever it is they're seeing, hearing, or learning about. And I think that's what we would see"},"507":{"dur":4,"text":"in a typical classroom. We would have these rich discussions and that's what"},"511":{"dur":4,"text":"Sites allows me to do. \nAudrey: And I think it's good to point out that"},"515":{"dur":4,"text":"Christin and Bert kind of you know through conversations may have found Sites at Penn State"},"519":{"dur":4,"text":"as a resource to use, but then they delved"},"523":{"dur":4,"text":"they dove into it themselves, figured out what they could use based on their objectives"},"527":{"dur":4,"text":"felt that they could be creative in that space with"},"532":{"dur":4,"text":"not any centralized support helping them out ultimately."},"536":{"dur":4,"text":"Not a multimedia specialist or anything like that, and so that's kind of part of the"},"540":{"dur":4,"text":"beauty of the service, especially for campuses who don't have those types"},"544":{"dur":4,"text":"of resources, you have this at your disposal and there is still backing you up"},"548":{"dur":4,"text":"there is centralized support to help you through as well as learning"},"552":{"dur":4,"text":"design support out of ETS.\nBert: Thank you. Yeah I think that that's"},"556":{"dur":4,"text":"a very important message and a part that's been important for me is that"},"560":{"dur":4,"text":"as far as the evolution of this and thinking about the background,"},"564":{"dur":4,"text":"again it's you know we I just sat in a talk on presenting autopsies"},"568":{"dur":4,"text":"online and sort of doing that and they talked about the team the came together. And I"},"572":{"dur":4,"text":"think teams are great and that's wonderful, but the amount of time that went into that project"},"576":{"dur":4,"text":"again with all the other classes that I was teaching and everything else that was going on, this was something"},"580":{"dur":4,"text":"that I needed to do on my own when I could do it and"},"584":{"dur":4,"text":"maybe will evolve into something where there are a greater number of people involved, but"},"588":{"dur":4,"text":"I had to sort of be able to do a lot of this and it started very much"},"592":{"dur":4,"text":"on my own sort of trying to figure some of these things out. A little bit of the evolution"},"596":{"dur":4,"text":"of my particular class, as I said I've been teaching it now for five years and there was a woman"},"600":{"dur":4,"text":"Karen Vines that was teaching it for a year and a half, two years before"},"604":{"dur":4,"text":"I started teaching it. It started on Angel. It was an Angel-based"},"608":{"dur":4,"text":"course. It had discussion groups that the students participated in"},"612":{"dur":4,"text":"that are part of Angel. All of you that are familiar with Angel know your"},"616":{"dur":4,"text":"sort of discussion groups that you can use. And she was also using very basic"},"620":{"dur":4,"text":"simplistic wikis for the students to kind of put together their own"},"624":{"dur":4,"text":"little Web sites, but I'm talking very, very simple sort of things"},"628":{"dur":4,"text":"that were being done at that time. There was also and"},"632":{"dur":4,"text":"there continues to be, although we're phasing this out, a use of Adobe Connect."},"636":{"dur":4,"text":"as a part of that. That has been a useful tool from an interaction and communication"},"640":{"dur":4,"text":"standpoint. However, my class has in the past"},"644":{"dur":4,"text":"had a set meeting time once a week in addition to all of"},"648":{"dur":4,"text":"the online material and we're doing away with that to allow for greater flexibility"},"652":{"dur":4,"text":"of students taking the class and participating in material at any"},"656":{"dur":4,"text":"time that they want. I'm on the one part torn to see that go, but"},"660":{"dur":4,"text":"on the other part understand. I have to say my own experience has been"},"665":{"dur":4,"text":"that Adobe Connect has been problematic for me in regard to students"},"669":{"dur":4,"text":"and their connection and how well it's worked for what I want to be able to do."},"673":{"dur":4,"text":"For what it does, it does a pretty good job. I'm not sure there's a better one out there, but that's been a problem."},"677":{"dur":4,"text":"Then I got into Blogs at Penn State when that was made available in that Movable Type platform"},"681":{"dur":4,"text":"I jumped in started using that and that's where I designed the first Web site"},"685":{"dur":4,"text":"for this class and was excited about that and that was all wonderful."},"689":{"dur":4,"text":"And then heard little flutterings of that's gtoing away"},"693":{"dur":4,"text":"and so maybe you should look at Sites at Penn State, so I did and was pleasantly"},"697":{"dur":4,"text":"surprised Sites at Penn State was much more flexible and gave me a lot"},"701":{"dur":4,"text":"more tools and that's kind of how I ended up where I am now."},"705":{"dur":4,"text":"And this might be a good opportunity to just quickly take a look"},"709":{"dur":4,"text":"at our sites. You know again we'll bounce back and forth between"},"713":{"dur":4,"text":"these but just a quick"},"717":{"dur":4,"text":"view. This is my Web site through Sites at Penn State"},"721":{"dur":4,"text":"and again I try to be creative with how I put it together and you'll see"},"725":{"dur":4,"text":"some differences between how Christine and I have put things together."},"729":{"dur":4,"text":"And I should show, I do have an actual example page that"},"733":{"dur":4,"text":"may be in the program that people can look at, I'm not sure, that isn't the this is the"},"737":{"dur":4,"text":"actual live class. Students are taking this right now. But I've got tabs across the top"},"741":{"dur":4,"text":"that are all parts of the class, it's got a background on it."},"745":{"dur":4,"text":"If I move down the page here (if it would move down the page there),"},"749":{"dur":4,"text":"you can see that this is a particular topic that students are discussing"},"753":{"dur":4,"text":"equine feeds in the future. So, Christine, I'll pull yours up and you can"},"757":{"dur":4,"text":"Audrey: I think another thing about Bert's course online is that"},"761":{"dur":4,"text":"the home page is actually straight to the course materials."},"765":{"dur":4,"text":"Right?\nBert: Yeah, that was something that your group sort of highlighted."},"769":{"dur":4,"text":"This is where they land and I think what was different about this is"},"773":{"dur":4,"text":"that it typically is sort of an introduction. They drop right onto the lecture"},"777":{"dur":4,"text":"materials here. So this is the material that they're covering and my experience"},"781":{"dur":4,"text":"is what led me to do this is that again keeping this"},"785":{"dur":4,"text":"there will be another talk this afternoon about how students move through Web sites and what they do."},"789":{"dur":4,"text":"And my experience was that in order to make this simple and straightforward for the students"},"794":{"dur":4,"text":"dropping them where the lecture material was immediately and having that available"},"798":{"dur":4,"text":"to them was the simplest thing for them and that's what they needed"},"802":{"dur":4,"text":"to find first. Now I do have a tab at the top there of listed"},"806":{"dur":4,"text":"critical materials that they could go to at any time that has the syllabus and the class calendar"},"810":{"dur":4,"text":"on it, so that would be the secondary place that they seem to go, but this lets"},"814":{"dur":4,"text":"them drop in where they need to be immediately.\nAudrey: Yeah and that choice is very"},"818":{"dur":4,"text":"user-centered. I think I've seen most online courses seem to have"},"822":{"dur":4,"text":"this like \"Welcome to the Intro to blah blah blah Course\" and you know while that"},"826":{"dur":4,"text":"is valid on the first day, that's useless for them throughout the rest of"},"830":{"dur":4,"text":"the course, so dropping them into that course material is pretty"},"834":{"dur":4,"text":"fantastic to see.\nBert: Do you want to go to your next slide or you"},"838":{"dur":4,"text":"can do what you want.\nChristine: And actually to piggyback off that thought"},"842":{"dur":4,"text":"I did exactly that - welcome to this course - and realized"},"846":{"dur":4,"text":"as a result we're going to get into some of the challenges and things we would do for the future"},"850":{"dur":4,"text":"and that is one of the first things that I realized probably"},"854":{"dur":4,"text":"about a week or so into the course I realized that wait a minute, I really need"},"858":{"dur":4,"text":"to change my layout, but at that point it was kind of too late"},"862":{"dur":4,"text":"we were already on the train and moving, so I realized this is going to happen for this"},"866":{"dur":4,"text":"coming summer, so I'm showing you last year's course"},"870":{"dur":4,"text":"or last summer's course. And I have plenty of things, I have lots of things that I will"},"874":{"dur":4,"text":"tell you about that I plan to change for next year and that is definitely one of them, because"},"878":{"dur":4,"text":"just the layout alone I think could use some sprucing up."},"882":{"dur":4,"text":"So as you can see mine similarly has at the top"},"886":{"dur":4,"text":"going over exactly that, just the assignment information"},"890":{"dur":4,"text":"the things there's rubrics available and that each of the lessons they can drop down."},"894":{"dur":4,"text":"You know I only at the time would allow them into so many lessons at a time"},"898":{"dur":4,"text":"because I did not want them to move so far ahead so quickly, so I allowed"},"902":{"dur":4,"text":"them probably about a two week window that they're able to move forward"},"906":{"dur":4,"text":"but I don't want them to move so fast, because they're going to get"},"910":{"dur":4,"text":"away from those discussions. For me, I graded the discussions in a way that they had to"},"914":{"dur":4,"text":"not only respond to the initial discussion prompt, but that they also had to"},"918":{"dur":4,"text":"respond to or ask questions to two other of their peers."},"922":{"dur":4,"text":"So that meant that if they moved too far ahead, they'd be for"},"926":{"dur":4,"text":"almost forgetting the content from the previous discussions and I didn't want to lose site of those"},"930":{"dur":4,"text":"rich discussions that I'd typically have in the classroom. And again I"},"934":{"dur":4,"text":"have a group online project that they had to complete so"},"938":{"dur":4,"text":"the resources are available as well. And as I shared with you earlier"},"942":{"dur":4,"text":"at any time at the bottom of the page"},"946":{"dur":4,"text":"they could leave a comment. So at any time if there's anything on any of those"},"950":{"dur":4,"text":"pages related to the lessons, the assignments, the group project, anything at all"},"954":{"dur":4,"text":"they could always have that dialog and it immediately shows up on the side feed."},"959":{"dur":4,"text":"Bert: Christine, if I might jump in there. Again, that"},"963":{"dur":4,"text":"you know you talk about the discussion component of this. So this is something"},"967":{"dur":4,"text":"that I've used extensively, so if we pick one"},"971":{"dur":4,"text":"of these particular what I call lecture pages"},"975":{"dur":4,"text":"so I've chosen, I think I chose Equine Nutrition because I like Equine Nutrition."},"979":{"dur":4,"text":"so for each of those lecture pages I've put my learning objectives"},"983":{"dur":4,"text":"for that particular day at the top. There are a number of"},"987":{"dur":4,"text":"and I've come to using YouTube videos now. I was using"},"991":{"dur":4,"text":"some other things which I'll mention later. They've got text and material"},"995":{"dur":4,"text":"here in between, they've got links to other Web sites and other material"},"999":{"dur":4,"text":"they've got questions to think about for that material,"},"1003":{"dur":4,"text":"but then the [ inaudible ]. So this is again a week's worth"},"1007":{"dur":4,"text":"of material that you're seeing here. Okay? This is"},"1011":{"dur":4,"text":"what I'm using and this has been an ongoing evolution"},"1015":{"dur":4,"text":"as far as this interaction online. And I think this is a very important"},"1019":{"dur":4,"text":"part of their participation in this."},"1023":{"dur":4,"text":"So my students receive a grade for their"},"1027":{"dur":4,"text":"commenting, and I lay out very specifically"},"1031":{"dur":4,"text":"and I could show you, if we had a we'll see how the time"},"1035":{"dur":4,"text":"goes, I lay out very specifically and I've learned this over the years exactly"},"1039":{"dur":4,"text":"what I'm looking for in their comments as far as"},"1043":{"dur":4,"text":"now exactly. I give them flexibility because I want that and that's been one of the beauties of this"},"1047":{"dur":4,"text":"but they have to ask two or three questions about the"},"1051":{"dur":4,"text":"material, they have to comment and bring their own"},"1055":{"dur":4,"text":"personal experience to the material and I ask them to do that."},"1059":{"dur":4,"text":"And finally I ask them to go out into the big wide world"},"1063":{"dur":4,"text":"particularly online and find some other material online that relates to that. And I ask"},"1067":{"dur":4,"text":"them to try to find material that other students haven't already brought in."},"1071":{"dur":4,"text":"this class is about 40 students in size, it may increase some in the future."},"1075":{"dur":4,"text":"But that leads to a very rich dialog"},"1079":{"dur":4,"text":"that ends up happening here in the comments section. And again it's not"},"1083":{"dur":4,"text":"the same as in the classroom, right? So but the fact of the matter is I've seen"},"1087":{"dur":4,"text":"things here that I've never seen in the classroom, because all of the"},"1091":{"dur":4,"text":"students are participating, because I'm asking them to do that."},"1095":{"dur":6,"text":"I have a TA that helps me with this and grading is hard. Okay?"},"1102":{"dur":4,"text":"This has been really rewarding for me, because I see something different from every single one"},"1106":{"dur":4,"text":"of the students and it's really been great! This has been one of the best parts of this class."},"1110":{"dur":4,"text":"through all that different course material.\nAudience: Do they see each others' comments?\nBert: Yes, and"},"1114":{"dur":4,"text":"so I emphasize although I don't require it because then it"},"1118":{"dur":4,"text":"creates a whole 'nother layer of grading. I say look if you can reply to somebody else's comments"},"1122":{"dur":4,"text":"and you can feed on that I have seen some threaded feeds where they do go through"},"1126":{"dur":4,"text":"and do that and I ask them to do that. I will also - this is"},"1130":{"dur":4,"text":"a key component of another part of the class that I'll talk about a little bit later."},"1134":{"dur":4,"text":"So we'll get to that."},"1138":{"dur":4,"text":"Audrey: I think another"},"1142":{"dur":4,"text":"thing to point out with Bert's course is that it's fully open"},"1146":{"dur":4,"text":"It's not locked behind Web Access so not only can each student see"},"1150":{"dur":4,"text":"the other students' comments, so can all of you.\nBert: No, it is"},"1154":{"dur":4,"text":"blocked, but there are parts of it that are not blocked.

The idea of this collaborative"},"1448":{"dur":4,"text":"group project. I felt that I really wanted them to do something online. I wanted them"},"1452":{"dur":4,"text":"to have a group project. I would have them do that in the class anyway, so I felt"},"1456":{"dur":4,"text":"that the resources that I gave them were helpful, but I"},"1460":{"dur":4,"text":"again they didn't necessarily know how to use them. So I think I would have"},"1464":{"dur":4,"text":"more resources available, again more how-to videos, again just more"},"1468":{"dur":4,"text":"support in terms of implementing that.

Also I've"},"1484":{"dur":4,"text":"realized that I had some synchronous opportunities, but not of them were actually"},"1488":{"dur":4,"text":"mandatory.

I'm not sure how I want to handle"},"1512":{"dur":4,"text":"that, but I do want to provide more opportunities that I'm online that they can meet with me.

So I was actually having them"},"1537":{"dur":4,"text":"going back and forth between Angel and Sites, and an actual site."},"1541":{"dur":4,"text":"And I'm sure that was confusing to students, and it was only actually a meeting"},"1545":{"dur":4,"text":"with the team that I realized wait a minute, I can have them upload documents"},"1549":{"dur":4,"text":"and it can be accessible right there.

So the nice"},"1573":{"dur":4,"text":"feature of that is now I can see to make sure that all my students have actually watched the videos."},"1577":{"dur":4,"text":"So I can actually go through and look at the tool and say wait a minute, did they actually watch it?"},"1581":{"dur":4,"text":"Number one.

Again, I feel like I"},"1593":{"dur":4,"text":"underutilized this tool, because I really was just asking questions just to see if"},"1597":{"dur":4,"text":"they were watching the videos, if they were paying attention, and I think I would actually use them more"},"1601":{"dur":4,"text":"this coming summer for comprehension of content"},"1605":{"dur":4,"text":"and possibly application of that as well. I feel like I normally"},"1609":{"dur":4,"text":"would do that in a class setting, but I didn't do that with EdPuzzle and I would for the future."},"1613":{"dur":4,"text":"And then in terms of some things that didn't work... Yes..."},"1617":{"dur":4,"text":"Audience: When you said we could have embedded quizzes"},"1621":{"dur":4,"text":"So I go on and I say stop here in I don't know maybe minute 1:45 and they can answer the question and then they can go on?"},"1625":{"dur":4,"text":"Christine: Yes."},"1629":{"dur":4,"text":"Absolutely.

That's one of the reasons I wasn't"},"1645":{"dur":4,"text":"really keen on just using Angel in the sense that I just don't want to have myself talking"},"1649":{"dur":4,"text":"and having students kind of page through a Powerpoint . Yea! That's fun!"},"1653":{"dur":4,"text":"So, but I realize there are going to be times where I'm going to need to do that."},"1657":{"dur":4,"text":"There's just some content that I have to convey.

I really had to"},"1669":{"dur":4,"text":"struggle with that. So for me I had to use Doodle Pro"},"1673":{"dur":4,"text":"and then on my iPad and then upload it on DropBox and it went"},"1677":{"dur":4,"text":"it moved really, really nicely.

The first one that I heard Christine"},"1698":{"dur":4,"text":"say that we talked about is this using two different sites, you're using three different sites"},"1702":{"dur":4,"text":"as I started this you saw we were using Angel initially, we had these wikis,"},"1706":{"dur":4,"text":"then I moved into Blogs at Penn State, but I was still using Angel. I do"},"1710":{"dur":4,"text":"still use Angel and Sites both for my course, but"},"1714":{"dur":4,"text":"I have absolutely minimized Angel to just assessments. I used"},"1718":{"dur":4,"text":"for their exams or if - there aren't any quizzes, but I"},"1722":{"dur":4,"text":"use it for assessments. That's it. They don't go to Angel any other time. The syllabus is available"},"1726":{"dur":4,"text":"in Angel, but they shouldn't even be going there. The syllabus is available on the Web site as well."},"1730":{"dur":4,"text":"So I tried ot make it one Web site, not two differnt things with them going"},"1734":{"dur":4,"text":"back and forth. That was definitely a major problem early on."},"1738":{"dur":4,"text":"I tried using iTunes"},"1742":{"dur":4,"text":"early on and that was a total failure. That was an attempt"},"1746":{"dur":4,"text":"to record iTunesU to record my lectures and make those available. I thought oh this would be great."},"1750":{"dur":4,"text":"The students can listen to them on their phones and they can you know whenever they want and that"},"1754":{"dur":4,"text":"really didn't work very well. Maybe it's because I didn't really"},"1758":{"dur":4,"text":"adopt into it. I also happened to be a PC user and so"},"1762":{"dur":4,"text":"not a Macintosh, and so maybe I had some problems there and you know we"},"1766":{"dur":4,"text":"were talking about some of the difficulties that are there. Having said that"},"1770":{"dur":4,"text":"I would say the thing that's nice about Sites is that it is"},"1774":{"dur":4,"text":"sort of non-platform specific, so it works across all different platforms, which is really nice."},"1778":{"dur":4,"text":"My number one mistake that I've made over the"},"1782":{"dur":4,"text":"five years that I've been teaching this class has been to"},"1786":{"dur":4,"text":"appropriately communicate with students via an online class and make"},"1790":{"dur":4,"text":"sure they understand what the objectives are"},"1794":{"dur":4,"text":"and what they need to be doing at any particular time."},"1798":{"dur":4,"text":"So scheduling is difficult.

And it's still"},"1810":{"dur":4,"text":"it's certainly a PDF, but I hope that they print it off. The old syllabus"},"1814":{"dur":4,"text":"had sort of topics listed out and approximate dates when those things were going to happen"},"1818":{"dur":4,"text":"and some assignments to do. The new syllabus, the difference is"},"1822":{"dur":4,"text":"every single assignment has a specific date listed"},"1826":{"dur":4,"text":"next to it. That's exactly when that's due, those are distributed"},"1830":{"dur":4,"text":"over time.

Well I can tell you that when you're not"},"1851":{"dur":4,"text":"meeting with them on a regular basis in a classroom that time"},"1855":{"dur":4,"text":"component becomes very difficult and I just really think maybe"},"1859":{"dur":4,"text":"I am spoon feeding them a little bit, but this has been very helpful in them actually managing"},"1863":{"dur":4,"text":"to get that work done. I'm going to stop there, because we gotta keep going."},"1867":{"dur":4,"text":"Christine: Just briefly in terms of some of the"},"1871":{"dur":4,"text":"successes that we've had, I felt like the Sites allowed us to have a goo balance of"},"1875":{"dur":4,"text":"text, videos, activities, different things for them to utilize. In terms of"},"1879":{"dur":4,"text":"that schedule, one of the things that I utilize is from Remind 101 or"},"1883":{"dur":4,"text":"now I think it's called just Remind. And so basically the students have to"},"1887":{"dur":4,"text":"basically register their iPhones or their cell phones"},"1891":{"dur":4,"text":"and that was my reminder that each of the modules were always due on a thursday and a monday."},"1895":{"dur":4,"text":"So every thursday morning I would send out a Remind 101 text"},"1899":{"dur":4,"text":"which again, they don't have my phone number, I don't have theirs other than to see it. I can't"},"1903":{"dur":4,"text":"send them their own personal - and actually I don't see their phone numbers. I just see their"},"1907":{"dur":4,"text":"names. And basically I would send out those reminders every thursday"},"1911":{"dur":4,"text":"every monday. This is a reminder. You need to finish up the module today. Or even sometimes the night before."},"1915":{"dur":4,"text":"And again those module completion dates, two times a week"},"1919":{"dur":4,"text":"I really found how important, like I didn't realize"},"1923":{"dur":4,"text":"how well the pop culture videos and the things I was able to do with"},"1927":{"dur":4,"text":"the online piece, how well that turned out for my course."},"1931":{"dur":4,"text":"Had I done it in a traditional format, I don't think it would have, I would have had the same kind of rich"},"1935":{"dur":4,"text":"discussions and the same kind of reactions, because I wouldn't have used quite as many videos."},"1939":{"dur":4,"text":"I would have gone a different route most likely and I was really, really pleased with the students'"},"1943":{"dur":4,"text":"feedback, their comments, and again the insight that they had"},"1947":{"dur":4,"text":"as a result of some of those things. And again"},"1951":{"dur":4,"text":"they really find this to be a valuable experience. I had great positive feedback from the students."},"1955":{"dur":4,"text":"I used tools like Doodle Poll, Yammer, as I shared with you"},"1959":{"dur":4,"text":"EdPuzzle, Google Docs, I used Padlit, I used PSU Box, and again I used"},"1963":{"dur":4,"text":"Remind 101, all of which helped me kind of connect to my students and keep"},"1967":{"dur":4,"text":"things kind of rolling for them."},"1971":{"dur":4,"text":"Bert: So again, it's funny that Christine and I talked"},"1975":{"dur":4,"text":"and there's a lot to talk about.

These are just a few of the successes that I've had and tools that I've found"},"1983":{"dur":4,"text":"useful. So as I mentioned earlier, this class"},"1987":{"dur":4,"text":"for me has had more participation and more"},"1991":{"dur":4,"text":"I called this shared learning, we had the presentation this morning, amongst the students"},"1995":{"dur":4,"text":"than I've had in many of my in residence classes."},"1999":{"dur":4,"text":"I've seen things from the students and a participation in the discussion of topics that"},"2003":{"dur":4,"text":"I can only dream of in the classroom. Maybe because they're being"},"2007":{"dur":4,"text":"forced to do that to some degree, but maybe that's okay, because"},"2011":{"dur":4,"text":"it really brings some great ideas in the commenting that they've been through and I"},"2015":{"dur":4,"text":"have learned a lot. So I go through and I read through all those and I'm like wow, I never saw that Web site."},"2020":{"dur":4,"text":"before or I never read that before, and that's been a very rewarding"},"2024":{"dur":4,"text":"part of this for me. Sites at Penn State has really been nice for me"},"2028":{"dur":4,"text":"to be creative as a teacher and to be able to look at this myself and look at all the different"},"2032":{"dur":4,"text":"themes and all the different tools that are available and spend my summer"},"2036":{"dur":4,"text":"sort of going through and making the class what I want it to be. How I think"},"2040":{"dur":4,"text":"it can be best. It doesn't mean it's perfect, but that means you know that at least I"},"2044":{"dur":4,"text":"have that capability and I enjoy that kind of work. The people"},"2048":{"dur":4,"text":"in support at Sites at Penn State I can't speak enough to. Yes, Audrey"},"2052":{"dur":4,"text":"mentioned that we sort of dove in and did this on our own and it's funny because I connected with them"},"2056":{"dur":4,"text":"through a little coffee hour that they had. It was like I should go down and talk to them."},"2060":{"dur":4,"text":"And once I got there they were like hey you know we can help you with this and we can"},"2064":{"dur":4,"text":"help you with that and this is really great. And I was like wow, this is"},"2068":{"dur":4,"text":"got me all excited about it again, because they were very supportive and"},"2072":{"dur":4,"text":"I had felt, to be honest with you, I felt very alone. Sort of here I am in my"},"2076":{"dur":4,"text":"office trying to put together my quasi-online course and doing this"},"2080":{"dur":4,"text":"for years and hadn't felt a lot of support and all of a sudden there were people that were like hey this is great."},"2084":{"dur":4,"text":"We can do more with this. So that was really wonderful."},"2088":{"dur":4,"text":"Two tools and there are many that I've used. Because I'm a PC user I don't have a"},"2092":{"dur":4,"text":"lot of the nice movie tools available. Camtasia's been great for me."},"2096":{"dur":4,"text":"So Camtasia is a good tool. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles, but it works very well"},"2100":{"dur":4,"text":"and I can produce some good movies with that and I do a lot of my lecture recording with Camtasia"},"2104":{"dur":4,"text":"and Camtasia wants you to use Screencast"},"2108":{"dur":4,"text":"and I do house a lot of my videos on Screencast, it's kind of TechSmith,"},"2112":{"dur":4,"text":"which makes Camtasia, their tool. However,"},"2116":{"dur":4,"text":"it's not the greatest video hosting side. YouTube works much better."},"2120":{"dur":4,"text":"for a lot of the things that I want.
