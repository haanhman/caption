time"},"363":{"dur":3,"text":"to talk about that,\nbut let's talk about the"},"366":{"dur":1,"text":"passive radiometers,\nbecause Nimbus"},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"really started\nthis passive"},"371":{"dur":1,"text":"device thing here."},"372":{"dur":1,"text":"So really what they are,\nthey're instruments"},"374":{"dur":3,"text":"that they see everything\nin their field of

scatter,"},"391":{"dur":1,"text":"reflects back up\nto the spacecraft,"},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"and you see a cooling\nin your brightness"},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"temperatures, that's\nthe measurement there."},"398":{"dur":3,"text":"Rain can cause scattering,\nwhich causes the cooling,"},"401":{"dur":1,"text":"but it also has a\nmission and absorption,"},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"which would\ncause a

background."},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"Then you get a\ncloud over it,"},"412":{"dur":3,"text":"you see a big spike of warming\nin the brightness temperatures."},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's how you can\ntell you've got a cloud."},"418":{"dur":1,"text":"And the temperatures\nchange based on"},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"whether there is rain\nor if it's just liquid."},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"The surface also\ncontributes."},"424":{"dur":3,"text":"You can have scattering\nfrom say snowpacks"},"428":{"dur":3,"text":"or you can have a mission\nabsorption from, you know,"},"431":{"dur":4,"text":"asphalt or trees, or\nwarmer bodies like that,"},"435":{"dur":1,"text":"and so all of\nthat contributes"},"437":{"dur":1,"text":"to the brightness temperature."},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"So what do you get?"},"440":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is some work I did\nprobably 15 years ago,"},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"and what this plot is, and\nI will hopefully kind of"},"447":{"dur":3,"text":"make this simple is, so I\nhad a convective rainstorm"},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"and so... and the\nsolid line there,"},"453":{"dur":4,"text":"so this is frequency from 10\ngigahertz to a 1000 gigahertz,"},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"and then this is the\nbrightness temperature value."},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"And so like this is\na convective rain"},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"and solid precipitating snow\nis in this dotted"},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"line right here."},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"And then anvil cloud,\nso it's an anvil cloud,"},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"no precipitation\nfalling out,"},"471":{"dur":3,"text":"is in this dashed line,\nand then a shorter dashed line"},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"is high\nrelative humidity,"},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"and then low relative\nhumidity with the dot dash."},"479":{"dur":3,"text":"So you can see that if\nyou are here in this,"},"483":{"dur":3,"text":"you know, 180 or so\ngigahertz range,"},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"you can see\ndistinct patterns"},"488":{"dur":5,"text":"for all of these different\ncloud conditions."},"493":{"dur":1,"text":"But when you're down here,\nthere is really only"},"494":{"dur":3,"text":"two distinct patterns,\nthe rain or all"},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"the other cases."},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"So the idea is to try\nto get the channels"},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"that are sensitive to give you\nthe most degrees of freedom."},"505":{"dur":1,"text":"So SCAMS had\nthese channels;"},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"I already

you've\ngot cloud water;"},"517":{"dur":5,"text":"sensitive to the rain,\nwhich is the solid thing here,"},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"and then this is kind of\nall the other pieces,"},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"so you could kind of learn a\nlittle bit of information."},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"And then you could use\nadditional separation"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"between this one\nand this one to get at"},"532":{"dur":1,"text":"the rain in the cloud,\nI mean the rain.... yeah,"},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"the rain in the cloud."},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"And then this provided\nadditional information"},"538":{"dur":5,"text":"at the 30, 37... no,\nthese were the..."},"543":{"dur":1,"text":"the temperature\nsounding channels."},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"So they're not\nyou see them all coming"},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"together right here,\nso you're not getting"},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"much information\nat all about the rain."},"550":{"dur":3,"text":"That's all about...\nthose channels are for"},"553":{"dur":1,"text":"temperature sounding."},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"All right!"},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"So typical precipitation\nradiometers today"},"560":{"dur":4,"text":"have channels from 10\nthrough 89 gigahertz,"},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"and you can see here\nwhen you add the 10,"},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"you get this\nvery heavy rain;"},"569":{"dur":1,"text":"when you add the\n90 gigahertz,"},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"you get a lot more\nseparation there."},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"So you're basically\ngetting two or three"},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"more degrees of freedom for\nbeing able to distinguish"},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"between convective\nrain, falling snow,"},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"high relative humidity,\nlow relative humidity,"},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"and things like that."},"586":{"dur":3,"text":"So the GPM radiometer\nactually added three"},"589":{"dur":3,"text":"or added these additional\nfrequencies up here,"},"593":{"dur":4,"text":"at 166, 183, + or\n-3 and + or -7."},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're getting a\nlot more information"},"600":{"dur":1,"text":"and that
