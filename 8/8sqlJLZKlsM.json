that's\nwhat you want me to say"},"65":{"dur":2,"text":"is that from the age\nof three or something"},"67":{"dur":1,"text":"I knew I was going\nto study volcanoes."},"69":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's

then?"},"139":{"dur":2,"text":"HAZEL RYMER: It does sound a bit\nweird to say you do fieldwork,"},"142":{"dur":1,"text":"And what does fieldwork\nactually mean?"},"144":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, you have to go and\nmake the measurements."},"147":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, these days, of\ncourse, when I started we"},"149":{"dur":3,"text":"didn't have all this satellite\ntechnology and ability"},"153":{"dur":1,"text":"to collect\nmeasurements that way."},"155":{"dur":1,"text":"So now, actually\nit's a bit boring."},"156":{"dur":2,"text":"You can stay in Milton Keynes\nand do some of it that way."},"159":{"dur":1,"text":"HAZEL RYMER: Remote\nmeasurements, yes."},"161":{"dur":2,"text":"But you always need something\ncalled ground-truth,"},"163":{"dur":4,"text":"which is going into

what's going on?"},"216":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, what's the point?"},"217":{"dur":1,"text":"HAZEL RYMER: What is the point?"},"218":{"dur":1,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"219":{"dur":1,"text":"Oh, really!"},"220":{"dur":4,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"225":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, let's get to\nthe nitty-gritty."},"227":{"dur":0,"text":"What is the point?"},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, there's the\nacademic point of view,"},"231":{"dur":3,"text":"which is, scientists just want\nto understand how things work."},"234":{"dur":3,"text":"And so in the case of\nvolcanoes, how do they work?"},"237":{"dur":2,"text":"Why do they erupt\nwhen they erupt?"},"240":{"dur":2,"text":"And actually the\nreal point about that"},"242":{"dur":2,"text":"is that you can start\nto make predictions"},"245":{"dur":4,"text":"and you can start to help\npeople who live near volcanoes."},"249":{"dur":2,"text":"You can also look at things\nlike the environmental impact"},"252":{"dur":2,"text":"of volcanoes, both\nlocally and globally."},"254":{"dur":4,"text":"Bigger eruptions have more\nsignificant global impacts."},"258":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's a combination of all\nof those sorts of things."},"261":{"dur":1,"text":"So then, who pays?"},"262":{"dur":1,"text":"That's a very\ninteresting question."},"264":{"dur":3,"text":"Why would the\nBritish taxpayer pay"},"267":{"dur":3,"text":"for you to study a volcano on\nthe other side of the world?"},"271":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, partly, as I say, from\nthe academic point of view,"},"274":{"dur":3,"text":"and partly because there\nis a global impact when"},"278":{"dur":2,"text":"volcanoes erupt significantly."},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"Everybody, I think, will\nnow remember the 2010"},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"Eyjafjallajokull."},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"And although people\nweren't actually in Iceland"},"288":{"dur":5,"text":"when that erupted, many\npeople were, sadly,

terrible."},"298":{"dur":1,"text":"So pretty much\neverybody in some way"},"300":{"dur":2,"text":"was impacted, whether\nor not it meant"},"302":{"dur":1,"text":"you couldn't fly where\nyou wanted to out,"},"304":{"dur":1,"text":"or you couldn't\nget back to the UK,"},"306":{"dur":3,"text":"or you couldn't buy certain\nfresh fruit and veg that were"},"309":{"dur":2,"text":"being flown in from wherever."},"312":{"dur":2,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: So the impact\nis a lot more significant"},"314":{"dur":1,"text":"than just a volcano erupting."},"315":{"dur":1,"text":"HAZEL RYMER: Absolutely."},"316":{"dur":0,"text":"Yes, yes."},"317":{"dur":2,"text":"So the better we\nunderstand volcanoes"},"319":{"dur":1,"text":"and what their\nimpact is the better"},"321":{"dur":1,"text":"we can mitigate\nsome of the effects."},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"You can't switch volcanoes off."},"324":{"dur":1,"text":"This has been tried."},"326":{"dur":2,"text":"You can't stop them\nerupting, but what you can do"},"329":{"dur":3,"text":"is understand better\nwhat the precursors are,"},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"what the signals are\nbefore a volcano erupts."},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Which must put you\nin a very difficult position,"},"337":{"dur":2,"text":"I guess, because there must\nbe a threshold whereby,"},"340":{"dur":1,"text":"you know, there's\ncertain ones, I guess,"},"341":{"dur":1,"text":"that are more\nactive than others."},"342":{"dur":1,"text":"There are certain riskier\nareas, especially where"},"344":{"dur":1,"text":"populations are involved."},"345":{"dur":1,"text":"And so there must be\npeople making decisions,"},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"I guess, about when to\nevacuate, when it's safe"},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"and when it's not, when\nyou're at a higher risk."},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"How does all that work\nthen, and is that something"},"354":{"dur":1,"text":"you've been involved with?"},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"HAZEL RYMER: I've been a\nlittle bit involved in that."},"357":{"dur":2,"text":"But the really\nimportant factor is"},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"that you don't have\ninternational scientists"},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"breezing in and saying,\noh, yes, that's a volcano,"},"365":{"dur":1,"text":"I can confirm that's\na volcano and it's"},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"going to erupt next\nTuesday afternoon."},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"Absolutely you do all this in\ncollaboration with the local"},"371":{"dur":4,"text":"scientists and local civil\ndefence and other people"},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"because you have to have some\ncontinuity there on the ground."},"378":{"dur":2,"text":"You can't just have\npeople popping in."},"381":{"dur":3,"text":"You can have people invited\nto make some measurements"},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"that perhaps the local\nscientists don't have access"},"387":{"dur":4,"text":"to, that kind of thing, but not\nsort of breezing in saying it's"},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"going to erupt and then\ndoing a runner quickly."},"394":{"dur":3,"text":"Because, actually,\npredicting when a volcano"},"398":{"dur":1,"text":"is going to erupt is one thing."},"400":{"dur":3,"text":"In many ways what's at least\nas important and arguably more"},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"difficult is saying\nwhen it's going to stop,"},"407":{"dur":4,"text":"because once you have\nevacuated people,"},"411":{"dur":1,"text":"knowing when it's\nsafe to go back"},"413":{"dur":4,"text":"and to start normal life again\nand all the services and that"},"417":{"dur":3,"text":"associated with normal\nlife, when you can actually"},"421":{"dur":3,"text":"understand that that is safe\nto do is actually harder."},"425":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Yeah,\nno, absolutely."},"426":{"dur":1,"text":"Sylvia wants to\nknow whether there's"},"428":{"dur":1,"text":"a lot of practical work\nin some of the stuff"},"430":{"dur":1,"text":"that you're teaching."},"431":{"dur":1,"text":"So I guess for students\nthen, some people"},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"who might be studying\nsome of these areas, what"},"436":{"dur":0,"text":"is the practical side?"},"437":{"dur":1,"text":"You've mentioned some\nof the remote stuff."},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"And in fact, on the\nStudent Hub Live"},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"we're going to be talking about\nsome of the remote laboratories"},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"in the sessions tomorrow,\nwhich will be very interesting."},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"But in terms of your side of\nthings, what practical work is"},"448":{"dur":1,"text":"there for students to do?"},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"HAZEL RYMER: Well, for\nthe students looking"},"452":{"dur":4,"text":"at the geoscience\ncourses, geology courses,"},"456":{"dur":3,"text":"there are field trips to go on,\nsome of them with your tutor"},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"and some of them associated\nwith your courses."},"462":{"dur":4,"text":"So that's how everybody starts\nin the geological sciences."},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"And I would encourage everybody\nto get out and be involved"},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"in those if you possibly can."},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's how you\nstart, identifying rocks"},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"and in some cases making\nsome measurements."},"476":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: And are these\npractical field trips?"},"477":{"dur":0,"text":"HAZEL RYMER: Yes."},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"KAREN FOLEY:

yes."},"492":{"dur":3,"text":"There are, smaller, but\nstill some opportunities"},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"to go and get involved\nwith field trips"},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"internationally if that's

to."},"504":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not everybody's cup of tea."},"506":{"dur":1,"text":"We do have to recognise that."},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah."},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"But I guess it must be really\nexciting actually going out"},"511":{"dur":3,"text":"with people, meeting them, and\nhaving that experience of doing"},"514":{"dur":0,"text":"a field trip."},"515":{"dur":1,"text":"What sort of things\nwould you do?"},"516":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, you've talked\nabout measuring things."},"518":{"dur":1,"text":"So what sorts of\nthings might people"},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"expect to do on one of\nthese first field trips?"},"521":{"dur":1,"text":"HAZEL RYMER: Well, there's\nall sorts of things"},"523":{"dur":3,"text":"that we use our\nvolunteers to do."},"526":{"dur":1,"text":"Actually, most of\nit, people always"},"528":{"dur":3,"text":"say to me, what's it\nlike being a scientist?"},"531":{"dur":1,"text":"And I say, just like\nevery other job,"},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"you spend most of the day\ndoing emails and things."},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"What's it like doing\nfield trips and fieldwork"},"538":{"dur":1,"text":"on an active volcano?"},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"Actually, you spend most\nof time walking around,"},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"lugging heavy backpacks and\ncarrying stuff from here"},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"to there."},"547":{"dur":1,"text":"But having carried\nyour heavy equipment"},"549":{"dur":1,"text":"to wherever it is you're\ngoing to go and make"},"551":{"dur":3,"text":"your measurements,\nwell, you sit there."},"554":{"dur":3,"text":"You put your gas mask on because\nthere might be some fumes"},"558":{"dur":1,"text":"and things coming towards you."},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"And you sit or stand\nor whatever you"},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"need to do to make\nyour measurements."},"565":{"dur":3,"text":"You can be there for anything\nfrom five or 10 minutes to half"},"569":{"dur":1,"text":"an hour or longer in\na particular place"},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"making the measurements."},"573":{"dur":3,"text":"And then you pack it all up\nand put it back on your back"},"576":{"dur":1,"text":"and go traipsing\noff somewhere else."},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's a lot of hiking."},"580":{"dur":4,"text":"There's a lot of\ntricky scrambling"},"584":{"dur":1,"text":"sometimes, ups and downs."},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: I bet."},"589":{"dur":4,"text":"HAZEL RYMER: But it's sort of\nmaking, in some cases, quite"},"593":{"dur":1,"text":"detailed and\ncareful measurements"},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"in quite tricky circumstances."},"598":{"dur":4,"text":"I think that's one of\nthe most important things"},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"about the fieldwork, is\nquite often, well always,"},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"these instruments are\ndeveloped in laboratories."},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"And companies make them."},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"And they work really,\nreally well in the lab"},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"before you go into the field."},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"And you test the instruments."},"615":{"dur":0,"text":"You test the batteries."},"616":{"dur":1,"text":"And you test all\nthe bits and bobs."},"618":{"dur":4,"text":"And then you stick it\ninto an airplane hold."},"622":{"dur":1,"text":"It gets turned\nupside down and that."},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"Anyway, you end up the\nother side of the world"},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"and you take it all out,\nand it doesn't work."},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"And so there's quite a lot\nof fixing stuff and trying"},"632":{"dur":3,"text":"to extricate bits of\nequipment from customs,"},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"and all that sort of thing."},"638":{"dur":1,"text":"So there's all that."},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a lot of

risk."},"718":{"dur":1,"text":"Having said that,\nof course, you've"},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"got to be very, very\ncareful clambering down"},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"into active\nvolcanoes, and so on."},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that the most\nhorrible experience"},"726":{"dur":1,"text":"I had in the last\nfew years was when"},"728":{"dur":3,"text":"we had quite a large\nearthquake struck the volcano."},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"So that was sort of two\nnasty things in one place."},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was unexpected."},"737":{"dur":4,"text":"And we were just walking along\nthe rim of the active crater,"},"741":{"dur":5,"text":"as you do, and this very\nlarge earthquake happened"},"746":{"dur":1,"text":"and we all fell over."},"748":{"dur":1,"text":"It was that serious."},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"And we looked down into\nthe crater to see whether"},"753":{"dur":4,"text":"the volcano had been set off,\nwhich fortunately, it hadn't."},"757":{"dur":3,"text":"And we left the area\nreally quite rapidly."},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"But I say left it rapidly."},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"It took another two hours\nor so to get back to the car"},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"because it was quite\na clamber back to it."},"768":{"dur":2,"text":"And as we drove back\ndown the volcano,"},"770":{"dur":3,"text":"we could see the effect of\nthe

sparking."},"780":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, I mean, that\nwas quite exciting."},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"So it wasn't actually\nthe volcano itself, it's"},"784":{"dur":0,"text":"the stuff around
