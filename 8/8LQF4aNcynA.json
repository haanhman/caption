The second"},"692":{"dur":5,"text":"is a focus on the powers of the mind because\nultimately that is all we have to solve the"},"697":{"dur":5,"text":"many problems we face in own lives and work\nand in society. So the way in which we've"},"703":{"dur":4,"text":"thought about developing powers of the mind,\nreasoning, discernment, judgment, has evolved"},"708":{"dur":4,"text":"over time.
