Right?"},"60":{"dur":3,"text":"It sounds so logical.

experimental conditions."},"132":{"dur":2,"text":"And there are many\ndifferent ways to test this,"},"134":{"dur":1,"text":"but the basic design is this:"},"136":{"dur":1,"text":"We bring in a bunch of different people"},"138":{"dur":2,"text":"who supposedly have\ndifferent learning styles."},"140":{"dur":1,"text":"We teach them in a variety of ways."},"142":{"dur":4,"text":"Then we see if teaching them in one way\nwas somehow better for them"},"147":{"dur":1,"text":"or more effective than others."},"148":{"dur":3,"text":"So for example, let's say I had a list\nof words I wanted you to

those words and hear them,"},"166":{"dur":1,"text":"so you wouldn't actually see anything,"},"168":{"dur":4,"text":"but you would hear someone\nsaying: dog, hose, coat, etc."},"172":{"dur":3,"text":"Now if learning styles\nexisted, if it was true,"},"175":{"dur":3,"text":"we would expect that visual learners,\nor so-called visual

matching teaching styles\nto supposed learning styles"},"231":{"dur":3,"text":"or students' preferences\nactually makes a difference."},"234":{"dur":3,"text":"But I would encourage you to look up\nsome of this research on your own."},"238":{"dur":2,"text":"In particular, these review articles."},"241":{"dur":1,"text":"So how is that possible?"},"242":{"dur":3,"text":"I\u2019m sure some some of you are wondering,\n\"How does that even make sense?\""},"246":{"dur":1,"text":"Because it sounds so good."},"247":{"dur":4,"text":"And there's a lot of different research\non learning and memory to explain this,"},"252":{"dur":3,"text":"but one of the main ideas is that most\nof what we learn in the classroom"},"256":{"dur":2,"text":"and most of what our teachers\nwant us to know in

just like people have preferences,"},"267":{"dur":3,"text":"it's also true that some of you\nmight have better visual memories"},"271":{"dur":3,"text":"or better auditory memories\nor auditory

slide?,"},"287":{"dur":3,"text":"then having a really good visual\nmemory would help with that."},"290":{"dur":2,"text":"Likewise, if I had read you\nthe list of words and I said,"},"293":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Were they read in a high voice\nor a low voice?\""},"295":{"dur":1,"text":"or, \"Which words were read by a woman,"},"297":{"dur":1,"text":"and which ones were read by a man?\","},"299":{"dur":3,"text":"then having a really good auditory\nmemory would help with that."},"303":{"dur":2,"text":"But those aren't typically\nthe kinds of

you learn in the classroom\nis much more conceptual,"},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"or meaning based."},"314":{"dur":3,"text":"It's not just what something looks like\nor what something sounds like."},"318":{"dur":3,"text":"And by the way, this finding,\nthis whole idea, also helps to explain"},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"why simple rehearsal strategies,\nlike rereading your notes"},"325":{"dur":1,"text":"or just rewriting your notes,"},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"even though they're very\ncommonly used strategies,"},"329":{"dur":1,"text":"they tend to be not very effective,"},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"because rereading your notes\nor rewriting your notes"},"334":{"dur":3,"text":"doesn't necessarily help you\nunderstand the material."},"337":{"dur":2,"text":"In order to retain information,"},"339":{"dur":3,"text":"we have to organize it\nin a way that's meaningful."},"343":{"dur":1,"text":"We have to make connections to it,"},"345":{"dur":3,"text":"connecting it to our experiences\nor coming up with our own examples"},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"or thinking of how we're learning\nsomething in one class,"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"and how that relates to what else we know."},"353":{"dur":1,"text":"That's what helps us remember it."},"354":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a lot of research\nto support this idea"},"357":{"dur":2,"text":"that most of what we learn\nis stored in terms of meaning,"},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"and not according to visual images\nor auditory sounds."},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"But some of the best,\nmost relevant research"},"364":{"dur":3,"text":"comes from these classic studies\nthat were done in the 70s."},"367":{"dur":3,"text":"Chase & Simon were interested\nin chess players' abilities"},"371":{"dur":3,"text":"to recall pictures of chessboard\ngames in progress."},"375":{"dur":4,"text":"So what they would do is show players\nan image of a game in progress"},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"for a short time -- typically,\nonly five seconds or so --"},"382":{"dur":1,"text":"and then it would disappear."},"383":{"dur":3,"text":"Then they would ask the players\nto recall where all the pictures were,"},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"where all the pieces were in that picture."},"389":{"dur":1,"text":"And what they found was a big difference"},"391":{"dur":3,"text":"between novice players,\nor beginner players, and experts."},"394":{"dur":2,"text":"Beginner players, when asked\nto recall where the pieces were,"},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"could only remember about four pieces."},"400":{"dur":3,"text":"Experts, on the other hand, could\nactually identify almost all of them -"},"403":{"dur":3,"text":"over 20 of them, they could\ncorrectly identify"},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"on the next game board\nwhen asked to recall these."},"409":{"dur":3,"text":"Again, they were interested\nin knowing: Why is this difference?"},"413":{"dur":3,"text":"Why do we see this difference\nbetween beginners and experts?"},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"It wasn't because,\nlike you might be thinking,"},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"that the experts had better visual\nmemories than the beginners."},"421":{"dur":3,"text":"It was because the experts\nhad more experience playing chess,"},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"and more knowledge."},"426":{"dur":3,"text":"In other words, this game board\nwas more meaningful to them."},"429":{"dur":1,"text":"They could see the strategy involved."},"431":{"dur":1,"text":"They could imagine what was happening"},"433":{"dur":3,"text":"and why the players had their pieces\npositioned the way they did."},"436":{"dur":3,"text":"And to further support this idea,\nthey did a follow-up study."},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"In the follow-up study,"},"441":{"dur":3,"text":"they showed the chess players pictures\nof randomly arranged chessboards."},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"That's this picture here."},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"Now to you or I,\nor to a beginner chess player,"},"449":{"dur":1,"text":"these might look basically the same."},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, yeah, the pieces\nare in different places,"},"453":{"dur":3,"text":"but for the most part, they might be\nequally difficult to remember."},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"To an expert, though,\nwe found big differences"},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"when presented with\na randomly configured board."},"462":{"dur":1,"text":"Once it was random,"},"463":{"dur":3,"text":"experts no longer had an advantage\nin remembering pieces,"},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"because it wasn't meaningful to them."},"469":{"dur":3,"text":"Because there's no meaningful\narrangement in the second piece,"},"472":{"dur":3,"text":"they lost that advantage, which again,\nit just shows us further evidence"},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"that we store information\nin terms of meaning,"},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"and not according to a sensory mode."},"481":{"dur":3,"text":"And this basic finding, by the way,\nhas been extended to other contexts,"},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"everything from chess to basketball,"},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"to computer programming and to dance."},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"We store information in terms of meaning"},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"and not limited to particular\nsensory modes."},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's the first reason."},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"Another reason why this learning-styles\ntheory doesn't pan out"},"499":{"dur":3,"text":"is that the best way to teach\nsomething or learn something"},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"really depends on what it is\nyou want to learn."},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"It depends on the content itself."},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, if I wanted you, for example,"},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"to know what a bunch\nof different songbirds looked like,"},"513":{"dur":1,"text":"the best way to teach you that"},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"is to let you look at pictures\nof those songbirds,"},"517":{"dur":1,"text":"or let you see them in real life."},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"But note that that's true for everybody,"},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"not just because you're a visual learner."},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"That's because looking at them\nis what I'm asking you to do,"},"526":{"dur":1,"text":"to remember what they look like."},"527":{"dur":3,"text":"On the other hand, if I wanted you\nto remember what they sounded like"},"531":{"dur":4,"text":"or be able to distinguish between\ndifferent songs of different songbirds,"},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"then letting you hear them\nwould be the best way."},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"But again, that applies to everybody."},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"Just like if I wanted you to know\nwhat different flowers smell like."},"543":{"dur":1,"text":"The best way to teach you that"},"545":{"dur":3,"text":"is to let you experience\nthose flowers by smelling them."},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"But that doesn't mean\nyou're an olfactory learner,"},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"or that you learn everything\nbetter through smelling."},"554":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, take a minute to imagine"},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"what that would look like in a math class"},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"or an anatomy class or a physics class."},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"And as absurd as that sounds,\nit's really important to remember"},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"that the same problems,\nthe same criticisms apply"},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"whether we're talking about\nso-called olfactory learners"},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"or whether we're talking about\nauditory learners or visual learners"},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"or even kinesthetic learners."},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"The last three might seem\nmore palatable or more reasonable,"},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"but the same issues apply."},"580":{"dur":4,"text":"It really depends on what I'm asking\nyou to learn, the best way to teach it."},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"But that also brings me to another point,"},"587":{"dur":3,"text":"this idea that many things\ncan be taught using multiple senses."},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's not just limited\nto one, for example."},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"So, say I wanted you to learn\nthe game of football."},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"Probably the best way\nto teach you football"},"598":{"dur":3,"text":"is to get you out there and play football,"},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"to actually practice and have\nthat physical experience playing."},"605":{"dur":4,"text":"But you would also probably benefit\nfrom being able to watch a football game,"},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"or being able to look\nat schematics or drawings"},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"of the different formations\nand different positions,"},"614":{"dur":3,"text":"just like you'd probably also\nbenefit from hearing coaching"},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"or hearing feedback as you're playing."},"619":{"dur":3,"text":"You're getting the kinesthetic experience,\nthe visual and the auditory."},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"Similarly, if a music teacher\nwanted you to know"},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"the different parts\nof a symphony orchestra,"},"628":{"dur":3,"text":"then going to an orchestra\nand listening to one would be beneficial."},"632":{"dur":1,"text":"But it would also add to the experience"},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"if you had the capability\nto touch the instruments,"},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"or maybe to learn how to play them."},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"Or to actually watch one live."},"640":{"dur":3,"text":"Again, it's not that different modes\nmake it meaningful to different people"},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"based on their learning style."},"646":{"dur":3,"text":"It's not like the visual learners\nare only going to learn by seeing it."},"649":{"dur":3,"text":"It's because incorporating\nmultiple sensory experiences"},"653":{"dur":3,"text":"into one lesson makes it more meaningful."},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"So then you might be wondering:"},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"Why does this myth persist?"},"660":{"dur":1,"text":"There's a few different explanations."},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"The first one is quite simply\nthat everybody believes it."},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"It's so common that you never\neven think to question it."},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"How could so many people be wrong?"},"671":{"dur":3,"text":"If so many people believe it,\nhow is it possible that it's wrong?"},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"But as you know, just because\nsomething is commonly believed"},"677":{"dur":1,"text":"doesn't necessarily make it true."},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"Remember, just as an example,\nat one point we used to think"},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"that the Earth was the center\nof the universe,"},"684":{"dur":4,"text":"until scientists like Copernicus\nand Galileo proved us otherwise."},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"Likewise, there was a time\nin which some people"},"691":{"dur":4,"text":"actually believed or were worried\nthat polio might be caused by ice cream,"},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"which we now know is nonsense."},"698":{"dur":4,"text":"And, unfortunately, even today\none unfortunate myth that still persists"},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"is this idea that vaccines cause autism,"},"705":{"dur":3,"text":"despite the lack of any\nscientific evidence."},"708":{"dur":3,"text":"Just because a lot of people\nbelieve it, doesn't make it true."},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"And that might seem really obvious to you,"},"713":{"dur":4,"text":"but again, the key idea is that\nwhen something's so pervasive"},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"it doesn't even occur to people\nto challenge it."},"720":{"dur":2,"text":"We need to be willing\nto critically reflect on beliefs,"},"723":{"dur":1,"text":"even if they're commonly believed."},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"Another reason why this persists\nis, quite frankly,"},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"the idea of learning styles is sexy."},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"It sounds good, it feels good."},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"Saying people have\ndifferent learning styles"},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"is another way of acknowledging\nthat people are different."},"739":{"dur":3,"text":"And differences are important,\nespecially when it comes to the classroom."},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"But by saying that learning\nstyles don't exist,"},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm not saying people are the same."},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"People do differ in many important ways."},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"Learning styles just isn't one of them."},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"And just because some ideas\nsound really good,"},"756":{"dur":4,"text":"just because we really want something\nto be true, doesn't make it so."},"760":{"dur":1,"text":"We have to remember that,"},"761":{"dur":3,"text":"even when we're talking about something\nas appealing as Santa Claus,"},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"unicorns, Bigfoot or learning styles."},"767":{"dur":3,"text":"Last but not least, another reason\nwhy this belief persists"},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"is something called \"confirmation bias.\""},"773":{"dur":4,"text":"This is this natural tendency\nwe have as humans to want to be right."},"777":{"dur":3,"text":"People don't like to be right --\nto be wrong, I should say."},"781":{"dur":3,"text":"So when people have\nthis belief, or any belief,"},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"we tend to look for information\nthat fits our beliefs,"},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"and we ignore information\nthat doesn't fit our beliefs."},"791":{"dur":3,"text":"We don't really very frequently\ntry to prove ourselves wrong."},"794":{"dur":2,"text":"More often than not,\nwe try to prove ourselves right."},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"We look for evidence to support\nwhatever it is we think."},"799":{"dur":1,"text":"And sometimes this is deliberate."},"801":{"dur":1,"text":"Sometimes this bias is very deliberate."},"803":{"dur":2,"text":"You all know that person\nwho deliberately closes their eyes"},"806":{"dur":1,"text":"or plugs their ears and says,"},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"\"La, la, la, I'm

subconscious."},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"We don't even realize we're doing it."},"818":{"dur":3,"text":"How many of you, for example,\nhave ever been thinking of someone,"},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"only

suggest"},"841":{"dur":4,"text":"that we have these telecommunicative\npowers to talk to each other."},"846":{"dur":3,"text":"But the problem is that we notice\nevery time it
