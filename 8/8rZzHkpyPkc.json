up,"},"225":{"dur":1,"text":"they'd been absent for 70 years."},"226":{"dur":3,"text":"The numbers of deer, because there was nothing to hunt them,"},"229":{"dur":2,"text":"had built up and built up

major thing."},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"Much more significantly,"},"255":{"dur":3,"text":"they radically changed the behavior of the deer."},"258":{"dur":2,"text":"The deer started avoiding certain parts of the park,"},"261":{"dur":2,"text":"the places where they could be trapped most easily,"},"264":{"dur":2,"text":"particularly the valleys and the gorges,"},"266":{"dur":3,"text":"and

increase,"},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"because beavers like to eat the trees."},"294":{"dur":3,"text":"And beavers, like wolves, are ecosystem engineers."},"298":{"dur":2,"text":"They create niches for other species."},"300":{"dur":2,"text":"And the dams they built in the rivers"},"303":{"dur":2,"text":"provided habitats for otters and muskrats"},"306":{"dur":4,"text":"and ducks and fish and reptiles and amphibians."},"310":{"dur":4,"text":"The wolves killed coyotes, and as a result of that,"},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"the number of rabbits and mice began to rise,"},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"which meant more hawks, more weasels,"},"319":{"dur":2,"text":"more foxes, more badgers."},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"Ravens and bald eagles came down to feed"},"324":{"dur":2,"text":"on the carrion that the wolves had left."},"326":{"dur":3,"text":"Bears fed on it too, and their population began to rise as well,"},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"partly also because there were more berries"},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"growing on the regenerating shrubs,"},"335":{"dur":3,"text":"and the bears reinforced the impact of the wolves"},"338":{"dur":4,"text":"by killing some of the calves of the deer."},"342":{"dur":3,"text":"But here's where it gets really interesting."},"346":{"dur":5,"text":"The wolves changed the behavior of the rivers."},"351":{"dur":1,"text":"They began to meander less."},"353":{"dur":3,"text":"There was less erosion. The channels narrowed."},"357":{"dur":2,"text":"More pools formed, more riffle sections,"},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"all of which were great for wildlife habitats."},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"The rivers changed"},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"in response to the wolves,"},"366":{"dur":3,"text":"and the reason was that the regenerating forests"},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"stabilized the banks so that they collapsed less often,"},"373":{"dur":3,"text":"so that the rivers became more fixed in their course."},"376":{"dur":3,"text":"Similarly, by driving the deer out of some places"},"380":{"dur":4,"text":"and the vegetation recovering on the valley sides,"},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"there was less soil erosion,"},"386":{"dur":3,"text":"because the vegetation stabilized that as well."},"389":{"dur":3,"text":"So the wolves, small in number,"},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"transformed not just the ecosystem"},"396":{"dur":3,"text":"of the Yellowstone National Park, this huge area

effects."},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"One of the many post-rational excuses"},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"made by the Japanese government for killing whales"},"413":{"dur":3,"text":"is that they said, \"Well, the number of fish and krill will rise"},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"and then there'll be more for people to eat.\""},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, it's a stupid excuse, but it sort of"},"420":{"dur":1,"text":"kind of makes sense, doesn't it,"},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"because you'd think that whales eat huge amounts"},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"of fish and krill, so obviously take the whales away,"},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"there'll be more fish and krill."},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"But the opposite happened."},"431":{"dur":1,"text":"You take the whales away,"},"432":{"dur":2,"text":"and the number of krill collapses."},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"Why would that possibly have happened?"},"437":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, it now turns out that the whales are crucial"},"440":{"dur":3,"text":"to sustaining that entire ecosystem,"},"443":{"dur":1,"text":"and one of the reasons for this"},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"is that they often feed at depth"},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"and then they come up to the surface and produce"},"449":{"dur":4,"text":"what biologists politely call large fecal plumes,"},"453":{"dur":4,"text":"huge explosions of poop right across the surface waters,"},"457":{"dur":3,"text":"up in the photic zone, where there's enough light"},"461":{"dur":3,"text":"to allow photosynthesis to take

food chain,"},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"which stimulate the growth of zooplankton,"},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"which feed the fish and the krill and all the rest of it."},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"The other thing that whales do is that,"},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"as they're plunging up and down through the water column,"},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"they're kicking the phytoplankton"},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"back up towards the surface"},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"where it can continue to survive and reproduce."},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"And interestingly, well, we know"},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"that plant plankton in the oceans"},"493":{"dur":1,"text":"absorb carbon from the atmosphere --"},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"the more plant plankton there are,"},"496":{"dur":1,"text":"the more carbon they absorb --"},"498":{"dur":3,"text":"and eventually they filter down into the abyss"},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"and remove that carbon from the atmospheric system."},"504":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, it seems that when whales were at their historic populations,"},"508":{"dur":3,"text":"they were probably responsible for sequestering"},"511":{"dur":3,"text":"some tens of millions of tons of carbon"},"515":{"dur":2,"text":"every year from the atmosphere."},"518":{"dur":3,"text":"And when you look at it like that, you

whales changing"},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"the composition of the atmosphere."},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"You begin to see that possibly,"},"533":{"dur":3,"text":"the evidence supporting James Lovelock's

to me,"},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"means bringing back some of the missing plants and animals."},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"It means taking down the fences,"},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"it means blocking the
