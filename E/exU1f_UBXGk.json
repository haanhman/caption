show you some new features\nin Verify Apps and even"},"567":{"dur":4,"text":"some APIs, too,\nthat you could use."},"572":{"dur":3,"text":"Then we have the sensor network,\nwhich is rather more elusive."},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"and this is our\nprivacy-preserving security,"},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"analytics, and telemetry\nframework built"},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"into every Android device."},"584":{"dur":4,"text":"This is how we can see\nacross the Android ecosystem,"},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"the health of Android devices."},"591":{"dur":4,"text":"It allows us to monitor\nthe behavior of apps"},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"and see when things\nstep out of line."},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"And when something unusual\nhappens on a device,"},"600":{"dur":3,"text":"we can use this sensor network\nto root cause that change,"},"603":{"dur":4,"text":"and then go and remediate\nwhere we are able."},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"The sensor network observes\nthings like critical security"},"611":{"dur":3,"text":"settings, device\nintegrity, and hundreds"},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"of other signals,\nwhich we'll look at,"},"615":{"dur":4,"text":"and I'll show you some examples\nof how that's interpreted."},"619":{"dur":3,"text":"Next is SafetyNet\ndeveloper APIs,"},"623":{"dur":1,"text":"and this is an area\nwe've been investing"},"625":{"dur":3,"text":"in a lot in the last year."},"628":{"dur":3,"text":"We want to provide\nways for all developers"},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"to interrogate the state\nof security devices."},"634":{"dur":1,"text":"It's all well and\ngood for us to say"},"636":{"dur":5,"text":"Android is secure, but\nactually for an app or any code"},"641":{"dur":3,"text":"running on the device to be\nable to make good decisions"},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"about that is important."},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is getting more and\nmore important every year."},"650":{"dur":3,"text":"As we see, many of\nthe critical decisions"},"653":{"dur":3,"text":"related to security being\ntaken not just at the operating"},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"system level, but at\nthe application level,"},"659":{"dur":3,"text":"so I'll cover three different\nAPIs in this session, which"},"663":{"dur":3,"text":"I think could be of value."},"666":{"dur":3,"text":"And last, we have\nAndroid Device Manager."},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"If I was to rank these four\nin order of importance,"},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"this would clearly\nbe at the top."},"674":{"dur":1,"text":"This is addressing\nthe largest risk"},"676":{"dur":3,"text":"Android users face when\nit comes to security,"},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"and that risk is, of\ncourse, losing a phone."},"683":{"dur":1,"text":"While we spend a\nlot of time, and we"},"685":{"dur":2,"text":"will in this talk,\nthinking about harmful apps"},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"or those sort of\nattacks, the reality"},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"is that the average\nAndroid user will never"},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"encounter one of these."},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"But nearly every Android\nuser will at some point"},"696":{"dur":3,"text":"misplace, lose, or have\ntheir phone stolen."},"699":{"dur":3,"text":"So we need to have a\ntool to help users out"},"702":{"dur":0,"text":"in that occasion."},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"So Android Device Manager is\nour tool to offer peace of mind"},"707":{"dur":1,"text":"in their time of need."},"709":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'll show you a\nlittle bit about that"},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"towards the end of the talk."},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"So the good news about\nall of these features"},"717":{"dur":6,"text":"is that they are available\nacross most active Android"},"723":{"dur":0,"text":"devices."},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"There's no need to have a new\nversion of Android to use them."},"727":{"dur":1,"text":"They're built on\ntop of the platform."},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"They're deployed through Google\nPlay Services and the Google"},"731":{"dur":1,"text":"Play Store."},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"And they are\nconstantly updating."},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"So I hope this\ncomes as good news"},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"that users don't need to be\nbuying a new phone to get"},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"In fact, a lot of the\nwork we do is making sure"},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"that users who are running\nolder versions of the operating"},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"system, potentially ones that\naren't receiving security"},"746":{"dur":4,"text":"updates, will still get\nthe core protections."},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"Here's the scale at\nwhich we operate."},"759":{"dur":4,"text":"We're protecting over 1.4\nbillion devices all the time."},"764":{"dur":1,"text":"The unique thing\nabout SafetyNet is"},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"that we have an unparalleled\nview into the Android ecosystem"},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"to spot when things go wrong\nand to offer protection."},"772":{"dur":4,"text":"We spot anomalies, and we can\nsee trends that are emerging."},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"We scan devices\npretty rigorously."},"779":{"dur":4,"text":"We're currently at about 750\nmillion device scans a day."},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"If I was to have given this\ntalk a couple of months ago,"},"785":{"dur":1,"text":"that number would\nhave been 400 million."},"787":{"dur":4,"text":"We're ramping up\nvery aggressively."},"791":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'll show you how\nthat works in a bit."},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"But let's begin by\ntalking about apps."},"797":{"dur":4,"text":"We're scanning over six\nbillion of them daily."},"801":{"dur":3,"text":"The Google Play Store is\na cornerstone of security"},"805":{"dur":2,"text":"for the Android ecosystem."},"807":{"dur":3,"text":"Google Play allows users to get\nthe most out of their devices"},"811":{"dur":4,"text":"by getting apps that they want\nto use to enable communication"},"816":{"dur":1,"text":"or games and so forth."},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's also enabling new\nbusiness models for developers,"},"819":{"dur":2,"text":"giving them access\nto a vast audience"},"822":{"dur":3,"text":"of potential consumers."},"826":{"dur":2,"text":"With over a million apps on\nGoogle Play and 65 billion"},"828":{"dur":3,"text":"downloads, ensuring the safe\ndistribution of these apps"},"832":{"dur":1,"text":"is imperative."},"838":{"dur":2,"text":"So this diagram describes\nat a very high level"},"840":{"dur":4,"text":"the security lifecycle overlap\nthat is distributed via Play."},"847":{"dur":2,"text":"So we begin in the\ntop left, where"},"850":{"dur":1,"text":"apps arrive on the Play Store."},"851":{"dur":1,"text":"This is where a\ndeveloper will upload"},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"an app in the form\nof an APK file"},"855":{"dur":4,"text":"to the Google Play\nDeveloper Console."},"860":{"dur":1,"text":"To have been able to\ndo this, the developer"},"862":{"dur":2,"text":"will have had to sign up\nfor a publisher account."},"864":{"dur":2,"text":"They'll have accepted the\nPlay developer distribution"},"866":{"dur":3,"text":"agreement, and they will have\nto pay a registration fee."},"870":{"dur":2,"text":"and for that registration\nto have been verified,"},"873":{"dur":2,"text":"details from the Google\naccount that was used"},"876":{"dur":1,"text":"and billing information\nwill have been used"},"877":{"dur":5,"text":"to process that registration."},"883":{"dur":2,"text":"So once the app's uploaded,\nbefore it is actually"},"885":{"dur":2,"text":"published, it passes through\nour comprehensive review"},"887":{"dur":2,"text":"and an analysis pipeline."},"889":{"dur":3,"text":"The first step of this\nis manual policy review."},"893":{"dur":2,"text":"And every app that's\npublished to Google Play"},"895":{"dur":5,"text":"is manually reviewed by a\nhuman for policy inspection."},"901":{"dur":2,"text":"So at this point,\nwe'll look to see,"},"903":{"dur":2,"text":"does the app adhere to\nGoogle Play policies?"},"906":{"dur":2,"text":"And we'll check\nit doesn't contain"},"908":{"dur":3,"text":"violating content,\nthings like spam"},"911":{"dur":5,"text":"or illegal content\nor impersonation."},"917":{"dur":1,"text":"So once it's passed\nthrough, and it's"},"918":{"dur":1,"text":"got past that part\nof the check, we then"},"920":{"dur":4,"text":"enter our security analysis part\nof the pipeline, which is where"},"925":{"dur":2,"text":"automated analysis kicks in."},"928":{"dur":3,"text":"This is in the realm of things\nlike inspecting the code that's"},"931":{"dur":3,"text":"inside the app, the\nfile is contained,"},"934":{"dur":2,"text":"and also running the app\n[INAUDIBLE] emulators."},"936":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll give you an in-depth\nlook at what that looks"},"938":{"dur":3,"text":"like in a couple of slides."},"942":{"dur":1,"text":"So this analysis is\nperformed on all the apps,"},"944":{"dur":2,"text":"and it passes to\nour score engine."},"946":{"dur":1,"text":"And the score engine\nis really what"},"947":{"dur":4,"text":"makes a decision about whether\nthe app is good or bad."},"952":{"dur":2,"text":"Either the score engine\nnotices some behavior,"},"954":{"dur":3,"text":"which is in line with known\nbad behavior, in which case"},"957":{"dur":3,"text":"the app will be rejected,\nor sometimes it's"},"961":{"dur":0,"text":"not sure about the app."},"962":{"dur":1,"text":"It sees something\nsuspicious, and then we"},"964":{"dur":2,"text":"pass it for another\nround of manual review."},"966":{"dur":2,"text":"And at this point, we end up\nin manual security review."},"969":{"dur":3,"text":"This is where it's passed\nto an expert in app security"},"972":{"dur":1,"text":"analysis."},"973":{"dur":1,"text":"And they will go\nand review that app,"},"975":{"dur":2,"text":"and then make a determination,\neither rejecting or approving"},"978":{"dur":1,"text":"it."},"979":{"dur":2,"text":"And the decisions that are\ntaken by those human analysts"},"981":{"dur":1,"text":"feed back into\nthe score engine's"},"983":{"dur":3,"text":"future decision-making."},"987":{"dur":1,"text":"So once it's got through\nthis part of the flow,"},"989":{"dur":4,"text":"we end up all being well, as\nis the case for 99% of apps"},"993":{"dur":0,"text":"in the published state."},"997":{"dur":2,"text":"Sometimes there are cases where\nwe've spotted vulnerabilities"},"999":{"dur":2,"text":"in the app that aren't\nintentionally harmful."},"1001":{"dur":3,"text":"Perhaps the developer has\nincluded a vulnerable version"},"1005":{"dur":1,"text":"of a library."},"1006":{"dur":1,"text":"An example of that\nwould be if you include"},"1008":{"dur":2,"text":"a version of open SSL\nthat's old and it's"},"1011":{"dur":1,"text":"vulnerable to the Logjam attack."},"1012":{"dur":1,"text":"So we would actually\nin this pipeline also"},"1014":{"dur":3,"text":"expose to the developer\nin the Developer Console"},"1017":{"dur":2,"text":"the information about\nthat app and say, hey,"},"1019":{"dur":2,"text":"you should probably\ngo and fix this issue."},"1022":{"dur":2,"text":"There are numerous\nsuch vulnerabilities"},"1024":{"dur":1,"text":"that we will alert\ndevelopers to."},"1030":{"dur":1,"text":"So this process is\nparalyzed, meaning"},"1031":{"dur":5,"text":"that most apps going from\nupload to the published state"},"1037":{"dur":1,"text":"get there in just a\ncouple of hours or less."},"1042":{"dur":1,"text":"But it doesn't end there."},"1043":{"dur":1,"text":"Every app is\nconstantly resubmitted"},"1045":{"dur":2,"text":"through this pipeline,\nbeing reanalyzed"},"1047":{"dur":2,"text":"and rescored every day."},"1050":{"dur":1,"text":"And the score engine\nis augmented with data"},"1052":{"dur":2,"text":"from the sensor network."},"1054":{"dur":2,"text":"This is what I referred\nto in the previous slide,"},"1057":{"dur":2,"text":"where the sensor network\nin Android devices"},"1060":{"dur":3,"text":"is reporting back how\nthose apps are behaving."},"1063":{"dur":1,"text":"So you can think\nabout it, where we"},"1064":{"dur":1,"text":"have the dynamic\nsort of analysis"},"1066":{"dur":2,"text":"happening in\nGoogle's Cloud, where"},"1069":{"dur":1,"text":"we're emulating these apps."},"1070":{"dur":2,"text":"We actually have a lot of data\ncoming back from real
