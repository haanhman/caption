economics"},"92":{"dur":2,"text":"educator from U of I Extension is here."},"94":{"dur":1,"text":">> Kathy Sweedler:\nGood morning, great to be with you."},"96":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nThanks for coming."},"97":{"dur":4,"text":"Tell our viewers a little bit about what you\ndo in your area of expertise at U of I Extension."},"102":{"dur":2,"text":">> Kathy Sweedler:\nWell I have a wonderful job because I get"},"104":{"dur":5,"text":"to go out into the community and talk to people\nabout personal finance."},"109":{"dur":5,"text":"I might, you know, sometimes be in a classroom,\nbut just as likely to be out meeting people"},"115":{"dur":5,"text":"in community halls or wherever their group\nmeets and we talk about financial matters"},"120":{"dur":1,"text":"and we talk about consumer issues."},"121":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nAll right, so the reason we brought you on"},"123":{"dur":5,"text":"the show today is we want to talk about budgeting,\nbudgeting for families, individuals."},"128":{"dur":2,"text":"First question is: how do you get started\non that process?"},"131":{"dur":3,"text":">> Kathy Sweedler:\nWell, you know, it's a tough one, right?"},"134":{"dur":4,"text":"Because we're looking at trying to change\nbehaviors and learn something new."},"138":{"dur":3,"text":"And interesting enough, I think that's it's\nreally, really important we know why we're"},"142":{"dur":4,"text":"doing it and that we have a vision of what\nit is we want to do with our money, what goal"},"147":{"dur":5,"text":"are you working towards, or dream, that you\nneed some money to help you get to?"},"152":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, before we even start looking at dollars\nand cents, I really encourage people to take"},"157":{"dur":5,"text":"time out, find a quiet place, at least for\nfive minutes, and sit down and dream big."},"163":{"dur":4,"text":"In fact, in my workshops I actually ask people\nto like color their picture of where do they"},"167":{"dur":4,"text":"want to be in the future, whether it's six\nmonths from now or a year or 10 years down"},"172":{"dur":1,"text":"the road."},"173":{"dur":3,"text":"And think, okay if I have this dream, how\nam I going to get there?"},"177":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's where I start."},"178":{"dur":2,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nAnd we had talked before we started taping"},"181":{"dur":5,"text":"about you really need a concrete goal, it\ncan't just be: well my life's a mess; I need"},"186":{"dur":1,"text":"to get my finances in order."},"188":{"dur":4,"text":"That can be maybe a reason but talk about\nsetting a financial goal before you start"},"192":{"dur":1,"text":"the budget process."},"193":{"dur":1,"text":">> Kathy Sweedler:\nRight, so that's an excellent point."},"195":{"dur":4,"text":"So, once you have this dream and this picture\nin your mind of what you're trying to do,"},"199":{"dur":5,"text":"then I encourage people to think about, okay\nso I want to travel the world, well let's"},"204":{"dur":1,"text":"try to be a little more specific about that."},"206":{"dur":4,"text":"In fact, we work with something called \"SMART\ngoals\" and that stands for-- the \"S\" is for"},"211":{"dur":5,"text":"smart, measureable, agreed upon, realistic,\nand timed."},"216":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, what we're looking at there is, let's\nsay you have a travel goal, well, where do"},"221":{"dur":6,"text":"you want to go and can you come up with an\nestimate of about how much it would cost and"},"227":{"dur":4,"text":"what's the date that you're working towards\nthat, that's the time part."},"231":{"dur":4,"text":"And then is there somebody else in your household\nthat you need to come to some agreement about"},"235":{"dur":3,"text":"this goal if you're working together with\nyour finances."},"239":{"dur":4,"text":"And then we can figure out whether it's realistic\nbecause once you have an amount, let's say"},"244":{"dur":5,"text":"it's $1,000 and you know the time period,\nmaybe it's 10 months away, well now, you don't--"},"250":{"dur":5,"text":"you're not thinking about, \"can I find $1,000?\"\nwhich is a lot of money, you might be able"},"255":{"dur":5,"text":"to say, oh, 10 months, that'd be about $100\na month, which is about $25 a week."},"261":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, we're getting that number down to an\namount that we can think about."},"265":{"dur":5,"text":"Like, can I find $25 a week to put towards\nthis goal, this dream?"},"271":{"dur":3,"text":"And now, we have a SMART goal that we can\ndecide if it's realistic or not."},"274":{"dur":2,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nAll right, so for a lot of people, I'd imagine"},"276":{"dur":1,"text":"their goal is to buy a home."},"278":{"dur":1,"text":">> Kathy Sweedler:\nRight."},"279":{"dur":2,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nAnd you've got to have that down payment money."},"281":{"dur":1,"text":"What are some other common goals that you\nhear?"},"283":{"dur":2,"text":">> Kathy Sweedler:\nI hear people talk about saving for education,"},"285":{"dur":5,"text":"whether for themselves or for their children,\ntravel actually comes up quite a bit, starting"},"290":{"dur":2,"text":"their own business is another one."},"293":{"dur":5,"text":"But it could also be things like saving up\nfor winter clothing or a down payment on a"},"298":{"dur":5,"text":"car, paying down credit card debt, so those\nare the kinds of things that I think are on"},"303":{"dur":4,"text":"people's minds but it's really hard to get\nit into your day-to-day habits and spending"},"308":{"dur":3,"text":"when there's all these other things like getting\nfood on the table, and paying those bills"},"312":{"dur":4,"text":"that come in that are kind of-- they feel\nurgent because they're here today, and so"},"317":{"dur":2,"text":"we kind of lose sight of some of those longer-term\ngoals."},"319":{"dur":3,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nAll right, so say we have our goals set, what"},"322":{"dur":1,"text":"do we do next?"},"323":{"dur":2,"text":">> Kathy Sweedler:\nOkay, well now, once we know what we're working"},"326":{"dur":2,"text":"towards, now we get to the numbers."},"329":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, the first thing we really need to\ndo is figure out just what is our income,"},"333":{"dur":5,"text":"and what are our income sources, and so, again,\ntime for that paper and pencil or pulling"},"338":{"dur":4,"text":"up that Excel sheet, whatever you're comfortable\nworking in, and listing out, you know, what"},"343":{"dur":1,"text":"is your income."},"344":{"dur":3,"text":"Maybe it's easy and you get a monthly paycheck\nand you're done."},"348":{"dur":4,"text":"But for a lot of people, income fluctuates\nduring the year, so you may need to capture"},"352":{"dur":1,"text":"that."},"354":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, then figuring out that total, and\nthat's the easier part of the other side of"},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"the balance, which is figuring out your expenses."},"362":{"dur":3,"text":"I think a lot of us could tell people, like\nyou know, if I asked you how much you pay"},"366":{"dur":3,"text":"for your rent or your mortgage, you'd probably\nbe pretty close."},"370":{"dur":5,"text":"But if I ask people where that last $20 that\nyou took out of the ATM went, then people"},"376":{"dur":2,"text":"are a little less sure about it."},"378":{"dur":5,"text":"So, we need to first estimate our expenses\nand do it-- kind of put them into categories."},"383":{"dur":1,"text":"So, that's kind of our next step."},"385":{"dur":3,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nSo, what-- how do you go about categorizing"},"388":{"dur":3,"text":"things for budget, because that is important\nto know your rent, utilities--"},"392":{"dur":4,"text":">> Kathy Sweedler:\nYeah, so that one is tricky in the sense that"},"396":{"dur":4,"text":"some-- we want to make sure that we have enough\ncategories that we capture things."},"400":{"dur":6,"text":"So, sometimes people say to me, well I know\nI went a large, you know, shopping store and"},"407":{"dur":1,"text":"that's where my money went."},"408":{"dur":4,"text":"And I say, yeah but did you buy just food\nthere or did you buy school supplies, did"},"413":{"dur":3,"text":"you pick up any clothing, you know, what all\nwas in there?"},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"We need to kind of break that receipt out."},"418":{"dur":5,"text":"So, you know, usually I suggest that people\nfind somewhere between 10 and 20 categories"},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"that make sense to them."},"426":{"dur":4,"text":"So, for example, for some families they're\njust going to want a food category."},"431":{"dur":5,"text":"But other people are going to want food eaten\nat home, food eaten maybe while at work, food"},"437":{"dur":1,"text":"eaten for entertainment."},"438":{"dur":4,"text":"So, it depends on the person how you want\nto look at your own spending patterns and"},"443":{"dur":1,"text":"what do you want to break it out to?"},"444":{"dur":3,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nWell, you brought-- some people recall from"},"448":{"dur":3,"text":"budgeting back in the day, or maybe even today,\nthe envelope system."},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"It's kind of a tried and true way of budgeting."},"454":{"dur":1,"text":"You actually brought some envelopes."},"456":{"dur":3,"text":">> Kathy Sweedler:\nI did bring envelopes because like you said"},"460":{"dur":3,"text":"it's tried and true; this has worked for people\nfor generations."},"463":{"dur":5,"text":"And essentially what it is is you make envelopes\nfor your different categories, especially"},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"those that you want to keep track of."},"471":{"dur":4,"text":"So, maybe, you know, your rent you kind of\nknow what it is and you don't need an envelope"},"475":{"dur":1,"text":"for that."},"476":{"dur":5,"text":"But then-- and you take your money that you've\nallocated per category for the month or for"},"481":{"dur":3,"text":"the two weeks, usually people will work on\nhow their paycheck comes out, but whatever"},"485":{"dur":4,"text":"works, and so you put like how much money\nI think I want to spend on clothing each month?"},"490":{"dur":3,"text":"How much do I want to spend on entertainment?"},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe how much you want to spend on groceries?"},"495":{"dur":5,"text":"And maybe you have a separate category for\nfood eaten out, that's not unusual."},"501":{"dur":4,"text":"And you put your money in it for the month\nand then when you go to eat out at a restaurant,"},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"you take money out of this envelope."},"507":{"dur":4,"text":"If at the end of the month this envelope is\nempty, oh you don't get to eat out."},"512":{"dur":2,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nIt's a very concrete way."},"514":{"dur":1,"text":">> Kathy Sweedler:\nYes."},"515":{"dur":2,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nRather than a credit card, you can physically"},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"see that there's $20 in there, or there's\nnone."},"520":{"dur":2,"text":">> Kathy Sweedler:\nRight, so it's a really good reminder and"},"523":{"dur":3,"text":"it just-- and it's something where you've\nlike-- you've made a decision and here's how"},"526":{"dur":1,"text":"you can see it."},"528":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, in today's world, a lot of people don't\nlike to deal with cash and this is, you know,"},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"just a very-- a different thing for people."},"534":{"dur":5,"text":"But there's a lot of phone apps or ways that\nyou can do it online that essentially are"},"540":{"dur":6,"text":"the same idea as an envelope system but you're,\nyou're not dealing with the cash, you're seeing"},"547":{"dur":1,"text":"it electronically."},"548":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, that's something else to think about\nthat you can search for those and find them."},"551":{"dur":2,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nDo you think-- do people do better in budgeting"},"553":{"dur":5,"text":"and dealing with cash because it's a real\nconcrete thing versus using their debit card"},"559":{"dur":1,"text":"or checks?"},"560":{"dur":2,"text":">> Kathy Sweedler:\nSo, that's a really interesting question and"},"562":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm always looking for research that would\ngive me like that definitive answer, and I"},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"think, I unfortunately have to say it depends."},"569":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nOkay."},"570":{"dur":3,"text":">> Kathy Sweedler:\nIt depends on the person; so for some people,"},"573":{"dur":3,"text":"definitely there's a reaction to spending\ncash."},"576":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, spending cash is harder for them,\nso in there's even some evidence that for"},"581":{"dur":5,"text":"people like breaking-- if they get their cash\nin larger denominations, it's hard to break"},"586":{"dur":6,"text":"it, so like to break that $20 or that $100\nbill, there's more psychological barriers."},"593":{"dur":5,"text":"But for other people, that's not really true\nand they seem to work just fine with, you"},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"know, using a debit card or a credit card."},"601":{"dur":5,"text":"So, I think again, you have to know yourself;\nyou have to-- if you found that you finding"},"606":{"dur":4,"text":"it really easy to swipe that debit card, try\nit with cash, see if that changes how it feels"},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"for you."},"612":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nI mean, cash feels, like for me personally,"},"613":{"dur":3,"text":"cash feels like it's harder for me to get\nrid of that; I don't know why, but I am one"},"617":{"dur":5,"text":"of those people that I think if I had cash,\nI'd probably spend less versus my debit card."},"622":{"dur":1,"text":">> Kathy Sweedler:\nWell, and for other people, they say, the"},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"cash burns a hole in my pocket, right?"},"626":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I've got it so I'm going to spend it."},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"It's just-- it's very interesting to me, and\nI wish I had, you know, like the exact answer"},"633":{"dur":4,"text":"except that I would say if you're trying to\nchange a behavior, maybe changing it in this"},"638":{"dur":1,"text":"way could help, you might try that."},"639":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nSo, you have your budget whether you're doing"},"641":{"dur":5,"text":"an envelope system or an online system, and\nwhen you've talked to people and your presenting,"},"647":{"dur":4,"text":"what are some of the places that money seems\nto be going out that they don't really keep"},"652":{"dur":4,"text":"track of or like people are surprised, oh\nmy gosh, I had no idea that much of my money"},"657":{"dur":1,"text":"was going towards this."},"658":{"dur":2,"text":">> Kathy Sweedler:\nThat's a really excellent point."},"660":{"dur":6,"text":"So, what I have found is that it's those small\namounts that we do frequently that really"},"667":{"dur":5,"text":"add up and catch people, and so they're sort\nof that latte clich\u00e9, but it's true-- it"},"673":{"dur":5,"text":"may not be a latte for you and I but it's\nsomething that you have made into a habit"},"678":{"dur":6,"text":"and you don't realize that oh, you know, if\nI spend, you know, $200 on-- I mean, $2 a"},"685":{"dur":6,"text":"day-- $2 a day on something, that's over $700\nin the year, and there, oh my gosh, there's"},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"almost your travel vacation, right?"},"694":{"dur":6,"text":"And so, when I ask people-- when we talked\nabout the steps towards, you know, budgeting"},"700":{"dur":5,"text":"and I said estimate your expenses, well the\nnext step is really to track your expenses,"},"706":{"dur":4,"text":"and that's where I ask people to really track\nevery dime they spend for at least six weeks"},"711":{"dur":1,"text":"if not longer."},"712":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, you don't have to do this the rest of\nyour life, I know it's not fun, but really"},"716":{"dur":6,"text":"tracking all those small amounts and then\nyou can look at it and say, oh I didn't realize"},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"I was spending that much on this area."},"725":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, you might say, but that's what I want\nto do and I'm going to stay there."},"729":{"dur":5,"text":"But you might also say, in this area, I'm\nnot getting as much pleasure out of that as"},"734":{"dur":5,"text":"it's costing me and I'd really like to try\ndiverting that money into savings or paying"},"740":{"dur":3,"text":"down my debt or something else that would\ngive me a lot more pleasure."},"743":{"dur":3,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nOkay, so a lot of this seems to be correlated"},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"to like when people want to lose weight and\ndieting."},"749":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, one of the things they'll say is\nto keep a food log even before you start to"},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"go on a diet, keep a food log."},"755":{"dur":3,"text":"Keep a log of where you're spending your money\nto see where it's going out."},"758":{"dur":2,"text":">> Kathy Sweedler:\nAnd that's because it all comes really back"},"760":{"dur":6,"text":"to changing behavior and so, the research\non changing behavior gives us some clues about"},"767":{"dur":1,"text":"how to help people do that."},"768":{"dur":4,"text":"And whether-- you're right, whether it's losing\nweight or gaining weight, or getting fit,"},"773":{"dur":5,"text":"or changing our financial behaviors, we just\nkind of know that certain things seem to help"},"778":{"dur":1,"text":"people."},"779":{"dur":5,"text":"And so, that's why you'll hear themes resonating,\nbut we're trying to apply it to money, which"},"785":{"dur":1,"text":"is a little different."},"786":{"dur":3,"text":"And I guess there's one other thing I really\nwant to bring up about budgeting and that"},"789":{"dur":5,"text":"is, sometimes people say to me, oh I tried\nbudgeting once, but I failed the first month"},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"and so I quit."},"797":{"dur":4,"text":"And what I want to tell you is that a budget\nor we sometimes call it a spending plan because"},"802":{"dur":5,"text":"that's a little nicer term, it's not in concrete,\nthis is a working document."},"807":{"dur":5,"text":"So, you've maybe set up what you estimate\nthose categories are, but once you've tracked"},"812":{"dur":5,"text":"your expenses, you need to go back and compare\nit to your estimates so-- and then, look at"},"817":{"dur":6,"text":"it each month and say, oh I spent more on\nclothing, but that's because my son lost his"},"823":{"dur":4,"text":"winter coat and I had to go out and get it\nright then, but I won't be doing that every"},"828":{"dur":3,"text":"month so I'm going to leave that category\nthe way it is and see how it plays out."},"831":{"dur":4,"text":"But maybe there's another area you're seeing\nconsistently higher, and you're thinking okay"},"836":{"dur":4,"text":"I just didn't realize that, you know, commuting\ncosts were that high, and I can't really change"},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"that so I'm going to have to readjust that."},"842":{"dur":4,"text":"So, it's a document that should be flexible,\nthat you're playing with, until you, after"},"847":{"dur":3,"text":"several months, you kind of get a really good\npicture of where your money's going."},"850":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nSo, what--"},"851":{"dur":1,"text":">> Kathy Sweedler:\nSo, you can't fail at it."},"852":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nSo, what should someone do if they sit down"},"854":{"dur":5,"text":"and they look at their income and their expenses\nand their expenses are more than their income?"},"859":{"dur":2,"text":">> Kathy Sweedler:\nOh, so that's it, we're trying to balance"},"862":{"dur":1,"text":"that, right?"},"863":{"dur":5,"text":"And we really need at least, at most stages\nof our life; we need our expenses to be less"},"868":{"dur":1,"text":"than our income."},"869":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, there are some stages, for example, students\nwho are going to college where really their"},"875":{"dur":4,"text":"expenses may be higher than their income and\nwe see that, you know, that's understand that's"},"880":{"dur":3,"text":"for a short amount of time and then they're\ngoing to do something different."},"883":{"dur":6,"text":"But if it's out of sync that way, then you\nreally have two choices, you can either: increase"},"889":{"dur":4,"text":"your income, and that might be an option,\nit might be worth taking more hours on or"},"894":{"dur":4,"text":"adding in another job; or decrease your expenses,\nand that's where we have to start looking"},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"at where can we make changes in our spending."},"901":{"dur":2,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nSo, what do you recommend?"},"904":{"dur":4,"text":"Say-- so you can't work anymore, that's not\na possibility."},"908":{"dur":4,"text":"So, cutting expenses, what are some easy ways-\nwell maybe not so easy- ways to cut expense"},"913":{"dur":1,"text":"in our day-to-day life?"},"914":{"dur":2,"text":">> Kathy Sweedler:\nWell, I think the first place we usually suggest"},"917":{"dur":5,"text":"people look is what we call kind of our flexible\nexpenses, those that aren't contracted, that"},"922":{"dur":2,"text":"they aren't a set amount each month."},"925":{"dur":6,"text":"And so, food is often one where people say\nthat they could make changes, entertainment--"},"931":{"dur":4,"text":"because we don't have like a certain amount\nwe have to spend on that each month, we can"},"936":{"dur":2,"text":"often find places."},"938":{"dur":3,"text":"Sometimes energy costs, those kinds of things."},"941":{"dur":5,"text":"Fixed expenses, like maybe our rent contract\nor our lease-- I mean our payment on our car"},"947":{"dur":5,"text":"loan, okay theory-- you can change those,\nyou could move and get a lower rent, but you"},"952":{"dur":1,"text":"probably can't do that next month."},"954":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nRight."},"955":{"dur":1,"text":">> Kathy Sweedler:\nThe cost savings wouldn't be right; you'd"},"956":{"dur":1,"text":"have to plan out for that."},"957":{"dur":4,"text":"So, first look at those flexible expenses,\nsee what you can do there, but sometimes there's"},"962":{"dur":4,"text":"stages in our life where we really have to\nlook at those fixed costs, too, and say, I"},"967":{"dur":4,"text":"really can't afford what I'm doing here and\nI need to make a dramatic change."},"971":{"dur":4,"text":"And that might be with those fixed costs,\nand you may have to plan it out, but you may"},"976":{"dur":1,"text":"have to do it."},"977":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nLet's talk a little bit about credit cards"},"979":{"dur":6,"text":"and credit card debt; how-- what's your recommendation--\nyou have to-- say you've got three credit"},"985":{"dur":3,"text":"cards and they're higher than what you want\nbut you've got to pay those off."},"989":{"dur":4,"text":"How do you go about tackling those so you're\nnot just basically paying off the minimum"},"993":{"dur":3,"text":"and staying at the same amount of debt each\nmonth?"},"997":{"dur":2,"text":">> Kathy Sweedler:\nRight, that minimum, I really call that the"},"999":{"dur":1,"text":"minimum payment trap."},"1000":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nIt is."},"1001":{"dur":3,"text":">> Kathy Sweedler:\nBecause really, if you just paying that minimum,"},"1005":{"dur":5,"text":"you're going to be paying on that for a really,\nreally long time, so what-- there's a-- there's"},"1010":{"dur":5,"text":"a strategy that we talk about called \"power\npay\" and there's really excellent calculator"},"1016":{"dur":4,"text":"online that's free to use through Utah's State\nExtension called powerpay.org."},"1020":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nOkay."},"1021":{"dur":2,"text":">> Kathy Sweedler:\nAnd what you can do there is you can
