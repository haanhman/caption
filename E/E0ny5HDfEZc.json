idea"},"266":{"dur":5,"text":"and give me a way to talk about\nforensic science in general."},"272":{"dur":2,"text":"The National\nInstitutes of Standards"},"274":{"dur":4,"text":"has recently convened about\n500 forensic scientists"},"278":{"dur":4,"text":"and academic experts to\nbegin to write standards"},"283":{"dur":3,"text":"for all of these activities."},"287":{"dur":4,"text":"So you see on your right\nis biology and DNA,"},"292":{"dur":3,"text":"and there we have biological\nmethods, which includes"},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"DNA and interpretation of data."},"298":{"dur":3,"text":"And we also have\nwildlife forensics,"},"301":{"dur":3,"text":"which is usually species\nidentification, but not"},"304":{"dur":1,"text":"always through DNA."},"306":{"dur":6,"text":"And so that little wedge is the\nthing I know something about."},"312":{"dur":3,"text":"At BU, we also teach\nthe chemistry things"},"315":{"dur":5,"text":"which are

or something"},"329":{"dur":5,"text":"worse; and toxicology, what\ndoes this person who didn't"},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"make it have in their body?"},"336":{"dur":4,"text":"So those disciplines\nwe work with at BU"},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"and we also teach\ncrime scene and a lot"},"344":{"dur":2,"text":"of general criminalistics."},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"There are, however,\nthese other things"},"348":{"dur":6,"text":"that are very important to\nregular forensic laboratories."},"355":{"dur":3,"text":"One is digital and multimedia,\nlike what does this guy have"},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"on his computer and\nwhen did it get there"},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"and what was he doing with it?"},"363":{"dur":3,"text":"And there's also pattern\nevidence, fingerprints,"},"366":{"dur":4,"text":"comparisons of tool marks,\ntire tracks, footwear,"},"371":{"dur":1,"text":"things like that."},"372":{"dur":4,"text":"And some of these disciplines\nare not as sciencey"},"376":{"dur":4,"text":"as we would like them to be\nand that will be a big part."},"381":{"dur":5,"text":"So right at the moment, DNA\ndoes have standards and crime"},"387":{"dur":1,"text":"labs have standards."},"388":{"dur":3,"text":"We'll come to another slide\nabout that in a second."},"391":{"dur":3,"text":"But technical standards\ncurrently do not exist."},"394":{"dur":2,"text":"There are guidelines in\nsome of these disciplines,"},"397":{"dur":1,"text":"but not standards."},"399":{"dur":4,"text":"So this activity at NIST with\nthis 500 or so people divided"},"404":{"dur":2,"text":"up into all these\ndifferent areas"},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"is to write technical standards."},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"And in our case\nof DNA, we will be"},"411":{"dur":5,"text":"writing additional technical\nstandards, which are needed."},"416":{"dur":5,"text":"So just as, again, an\noverview, most forensic labs"},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"are publicly funded."},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"So in Massachusetts, you have\nthe Massachusetts State Police"},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"Crime Laboratory, which\nis under the

umbrella of\nthe Boston Police Department."},"438":{"dur":3,"text":"In addition to publicly\nfunded laboratories,"},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"there are private\nlaboratories-- ones"},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"that do DNA, ones\nthat do toxicology,"},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"ones that do digital\nevidence, and others"},"450":{"dur":3,"text":"around the country that\nmay have other specialties."},"453":{"dur":4,"text":"And in addition to that, there\nare private practitioners"},"458":{"dur":5,"text":"and consultants who are also\nactive in the forensic

enforcement\nagencies is currently"},"477":{"dur":3,"text":"being hotly debated."},"480":{"dur":5,"text":"However, if you say, well, we\nhave a big pool of people here"},"486":{"dur":5,"text":"who think that they shouldn't be\nunder law enforcement agencies,"},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"wedging them out from\nunder the law enforcement"},"495":{"dur":3,"text":"agency is a whole other\nstory because then you're"},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"into politics and\npeople don't like"},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"to give up the things\nthat they control, right?"},"504":{"dur":4,"text":"So if that's the\ndirection we should go,"},"508":{"dur":3,"text":"it's not going to\nhappen very fast."},"511":{"dur":6,"text":"Now, another really good thing\nis that most-- it's not 100%,"},"517":{"dur":3,"text":"but it's close to all-- crime\nlaboratories are accredited."},"521":{"dur":4,"text":"There are about four\naccrediting bodies in the US."},"526":{"dur":4,"text":"They all accredit to the\ninternational standard ISO\/IEC"},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"2.7025."},"531":{"dur":3,"text":"Most of them have some\nsupplemental standards"},"535":{"dur":3,"text":"that are specific to\nforensic science like how"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"do you collect the\nevidence, how do you keep"},"541":{"dur":4,"text":"a proper chain of custody, how\ndo you write a proper report,"},"546":{"dur":4,"text":"things like that that are\ndifferent for forensic science"},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"than for some other activities."},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"And as I said a few\nminutes ago, right now only"},"555":{"dur":4,"text":"DNA and forensic biology\nhave technical standards"},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"that are required, and\nthat is because there"},"564":{"dur":6,"text":"is overarching national\nlegislation from 1994 that"},"570":{"dur":5,"text":"allows the FBI to have a\nconvicted felon database."},"576":{"dur":4,"text":"And that database is\nmanaged by the

convicted felon profiles up"},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"to the database."},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, I don't have any slides\nabout that database here,"},"598":{"dur":3,"text":"but it's very,

over\nhere, of which there"},"612":{"dur":3,"text":"are around 11 million profiles."},"616":{"dur":4,"text":"So we're not talking some\nlittle tiny data set."},"620":{"dur":4,"text":"And then over here\nare the case profiles."},"625":{"dur":3,"text":"These are case\nprofiles from evidence."},"628":{"dur":3,"text":"And so if there's a\ncase that comes up,"},"632":{"dur":5,"text":"it can be

compared to the\nother case profiles."},"646":{"dur":3,"text":"And if it matches some\nother case profile,"},"650":{"dur":3,"text":"then you can connect\ntwo cases and then"},"653":{"dur":3,"text":"these two police agencies\ncan get together, exchange"},"657":{"dur":4,"text":"information, and possibly\ncome to a faster solution"},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"for that particular case."},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, we'll leave general\nforensics for a moment."},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's talk about forensic DNA."},"670":{"dur":3,"text":"In 1985, there were\ntwo papers published"},"674":{"dur":5,"text":"that really give us the tools\nthat we're currently using."},"680":{"dur":1,"text":"The first of those\npapers was published"},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"by Alec

goes,"},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't know what went wrong."},"704":{"dur":6,"text":"And then has the aha moment\nof everybody on this film has"},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"a different banding

trash."},"735":{"dur":3,"text":"And you just go oh, it didn't\nwork, let me do that again."},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"And he didn't."},"741":{"dur":6,"text":"In the same year, Kary\nMullis discovers PCR,"},"747":{"dur":3,"text":"develops the method for\nPCR, which revolutionized"},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"all of diagnostics, all\nof molecular biology,"},"754":{"dur":3,"text":"and for which he received the\nNobel Prize not too long after"},"757":{"dur":3,"text":"that because it was\nsuch an important tool"},"760":{"dur":4,"text":"and allows us to identify some\nspecific segment of DNA we"},"765":{"dur":4,"text":"would like to copy, copy\nit in an exponential form."},"769":{"dur":3,"text":"So from two copies you\nend up with millions"},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"and then you have enough\nmass of this material"},"775":{"dur":4,"text":"to actually do some chemistry\nwith it or test it in some way."},"780":{"dur":5,"text":"These two things did not\ncome together in forensics"},"785":{"dur":4,"text":"until the late 1990s,\nwith our current testing."},"789":{"dur":6,"text":"But Jeffreys' discovery was the\nbasis for the early testing,"},"796":{"dur":3,"text":"and that was RFLP testing."},"800":{"dur":4,"text":"So what you're looking\nat here came from my lab."},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"This is a film that was part\nof the evidence in the Simpson"},"807":{"dur":1,"text":"trial."},"808":{"dur":4,"text":"And so you're looking at\nthese banding patterns."},"813":{"dur":4,"text":"This is the top of the gel\nand the DNA migrated

probes."},"827":{"dur":3,"text":"It's been a time since I had\nto talk about one of these."},"831":{"dur":6,"text":"But these were wonderful to take\nto court because a six-year-old"},"837":{"dur":1,"text":"can do this, right?"},"839":{"dur":4,"text":"So here's one known right\nhere, here's another known,"},"844":{"dur":1,"text":"and here's another

have short\ntandem repeats."},"885":{"dur":3,"text":"And what we're\ntesting are 16 loci"},"889":{"dur":3,"text":"and soon the labs will\nmove to testing 22."},"892":{"dur":3,"text":"So the FBI sort of\ndecides on the panel,"},"896":{"dur":2,"text":"companies make\nthe kits that have"},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"the primers and the\n[?

number of repeats"},"911":{"dur":1,"text":"that we have in our DNA."},"913":{"dur":3,"text":"So in this case, this\nallele has six repeats;"},"916":{"dur":3,"text":"this allele has nine; the\ngenotype for this locus"},"920":{"dur":1,"text":"is a 6-9."},"922":{"dur":2,"text":"It's nice to see in the diagram."},"925":{"dur":3,"text":"In reality, we're\nlooking at this."},"929":{"dur":4,"text":"So the x-axis here\nis molecular weight."},"934":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is a locus\nwhere the alleles have"},"938":{"dur":4,"text":"been made by virtue of choosing\nthe primers to be smaller"},"942":{"dur":1,"text":"in length."},"943":{"dur":1,"text":"This is longer."},"944":{"dur":4,"text":"And this y-axis is the\nheight of the peak."},"948":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, the peak heights

later."},"960":{"dur":1,"text":"But that does become\nimportant when"},"962":{"dur":2,"text":"you're looking at mixtures."},"965":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we have four loci here."},"968":{"dur":3,"text":"This one's heterozygous,\nheterozygous, homozygous,"},"971":{"dur":1,"text":"heterozygous."},"973":{"dur":3,"text":"And then all these\nfour are heterozygous"},"976":{"dur":3,"text":"and this one is also."},"980":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's what the\ncurrent data looks like."},"982":{"dur":3,"text":"This is half of a profile,\nbut I wanted to make it big"},"985":{"dur":3,"text":"so it would be easy to see."},"989":{"dur":5,"text":"And you might notice that\nat this locus right here,"},"994":{"dur":3,"text":"the two peaks are\napproximately equal in height."},"997":{"dur":2,"text":"That's a good thing,\nthat's what we expect."},"1000":{"dur":2,"text":"We have one copy of each allele."},"1002":{"dur":4,"text":"We would like them to PCR\nexactly the same amount"},"1006":{"dur":1,"text":"and give us the same height."},"1008":{"dur":4,"text":"But we have these other loci\nwhere the heights of the peaks"},"1013":{"dur":4,"text":"are not equal, and this\nis mainly a problem"},"1017":{"dur":2,"text":"with the PCR reaction."},"1019":{"dur":1,"text":"It's more of a\nproblem when you're"},"1021":{"dur":2,"text":"using very small\namounts of DNA and less"},"1024":{"dur":2,"text":"of a problem with\nlarger amounts."},"1027":{"dur":4,"text":"But what it means is\nwe have to understand"},"1031":{"dur":4,"text":"how big those\ndifferences might be so"},"1036":{"dur":3,"text":"that we know when we're sort\nof past the normal differences"},"1040":{"dur":2,"text":"when we analyze data."},"1043":{"dur":3,"text":"And so that's the data\nthat's coming down the pike."},"1047":{"dur":2,"text":"So the process goes like\nthis, and we're going"},"1049":{"dur":2,"text":"to have two slides of process."},"1052":{"dur":3,"text":"But ultimately, if you don't\ncare about the process,"},"1055":{"dur":3,"text":"you know that you get a\nprofile out at the end."},"1058":{"dur":3,"text":"So first of all, evidence\nis found at the scene"},"1062":{"dur":1,"text":"and the scene is messy."},"1063":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, I'm not a\ncrime scene person."},"1066":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact, I probably\nshouldn't tell you"},"1069":{"dur":2,"text":"this because you won't\nthink it's so interesting,"},"1072":{"dur":2,"text":"but I've not been\ninto a crime scene"},"1074":{"dur":5,"text":"because they're not happy\nevents and I never was really"},"1080":{"dur":2,"text":"sure that I wanted to go there."},"1083":{"dur":2,"text":"Just knowing something\nabout the evidence"},"1085":{"dur":1,"text":"felt like that was enough to me."},"1090":{"dur":2,"text":"It's like physicians,\nyou don't want"},"1092":{"dur":6,"text":"to know too much because having\nthe mentality that you're"},"1098":{"dur":6,"text":"going to get the bad guy is not\nthe mentality that you want."},"1104":{"dur":4,"text":"You need to look at that\ndata in an unbiased manner,"},"1109":{"dur":5,"text":"and so for me I was\nnever-- I don't want to go,"},"1114":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm happy with my position."},"1117":{"dur":4,"text":"So evidence is collected at the\nscene, brought into the lab,"},"1122":{"dur":2,"text":"and then you have to\nfind well, does it"},"1124":{"dur":2,"text":"have biological material on it?"},"1126":{"dur":6,"text":"And so there are relatively\nfast-acting chemical tests that"},"1132":{"dur":3,"text":"turn a color or turn\nblack or something"},"1135":{"dur":4,"text":"that says I\npresumptively have blood"},"1140":{"dur":4,"text":"or I definitely have\nblood or I may have semen"},"1144":{"dur":1,"text":"or I definitely have semen."},"1146":{"dur":1,"text":"And semen, of\ncourse, is ultimately"},"1148":{"dur":2,"text":"identified microscopically\nbecause you're"},"1150":{"dur":2,"text":"going to see sperm."},"1153":{"dur":2,"text":"And so at that\npoint, then you're"},"1155":{"dur":2,"text":"going to take a sample\nfrom that evidence."},"1158":{"dur":3,"text":"You would always like to save\nsome portion of that evidence"},"1162":{"dur":1,"text":"for later testing."},"1163":{"dur":3,"text":"Because if you\ndon't get anything,"},"1166":{"dur":2,"text":"maybe you didn't do a very\ngood job and somebody else"},"1168":{"dur":3,"text":"is going to try or maybe you\ndon't have the right technology"},"1172":{"dur":2,"text":"today but you're going to have\nthe right technology in five"},"1175":{"dur":1,"text":"years."},"1176":{"dur":2,"text":"If you

today."},"1188":{"dur":4,"text":"So if you didn't test it with\nRFLP and you hung onto it,"},"1192":{"dur":2,"text":"you can test it now."},"1195":{"dur":2,"text":"So then the DNA gets\npurified from the evidence"},"1197":{"dur":3,"text":"in some manner, goes through\na PCR-based procedure"},"1201":{"dur":3,"text":"to say how much\nhuman DNA do I have?"},"1204":{"dur":3,"text":"Because of course,
