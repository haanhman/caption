mushroom"},"9":{"dur":1,"text":"quiche."},"10":{"dur":2,"text":"You are going to love this."},"13":{"dur":6,"text":"[music]\nNow, I absolutely love quiche."},"19":{"dur":1,"text":"It reminds me of going to my grandparents'\nhouse."},"21":{"dur":3,"text":"They always had quiche and fun and fancies,\nso this is going to be an amazing quiche recipe."},"25":{"dur":1,"text":"I really want you to have a go."},"26":{"dur":4,"text":"First thing I am going to do is get some olive\noil into a nice, big ol' frying pan like this."},"30":{"dur":1,"text":"Around about a tablespoon -- get it all worked\naround."},"32":{"dur":3,"text":"You can see how hot that pan is, because it\nis sort of running away from it at the moment."},"35":{"dur":2,"text":"Alright, so we just push these onions in now."},"37":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's give them a little bit of time on their\nown, a little bit solo, let them enjoy it"},"41":{"dur":1,"text":"in there on their own."},"42":{"dur":1,"text":"A bit selfish, onions, sometimes."},"43":{"dur":3,"text":"They want to get nice and softened up."},"47":{"dur":2,"text":"It has only been about a minute now and those\nonions are smelling great."},"49":{"dur":2,"text":"They are starting to color as well, so let's\npush in our ham."},"52":{"dur":2,"text":"It is nice thick ham, or you can just use\nbacon if you prefer."},"54":{"dur":1,"text":"So I have it into nice little strips."},"56":{"dur":2,"text":"We are just going to brown that up very lightly."},"58":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, we are starting to get a nice bit of\ncolor on the ham now, so we are going to push"},"63":{"dur":1,"text":"in our mushrooms -- like so."},"65":{"dur":2,"text":"I have washed my hands by the way in case\nyou are wondering."},"67":{"dur":1,"text":"That's just the ham that is doing all the\nwork."},"68":{"dur":1,"text":"Push that all through."},"70":{"dur":3,"text":"Let those mushrooms soften up and the spinach\nis only going to need about a minute -- just"},"73":{"dur":1,"text":"to wilt."},"74":{"dur":2,"text":"So hopefully you can see that really nice\ncolor in the pan now."},"76":{"dur":1,"text":"All of those ingredient are mingling together."},"78":{"dur":3,"text":"I only have one more to join that party in\nthe pan."},"81":{"dur":1,"text":"In goes our spinach."},"82":{"dur":1,"text":"Oops, that one is trying to escape."},"84":{"dur":1,"text":"In you go."},"85":{"dur":1,"text":"It is just going to wilt up."},"86":{"dur":2,"text":"So, it is going to shrivel up and start to\nhug all of those other ingredients."},"88":{"dur":1,"text":"OK."},"89":{"dur":1,"text":"So, that pan I have taken off the heat now."},"90":{"dur":2,"text":"It is just cooling down now, because if we\nchuck it in there with these eggs it's going"},"92":{"dur":1,"text":"to cook it."},"93":{"dur":1,"text":"So, just let it sit there."},"94":{"dur":1,"text":"My grandparents would be proud of that right\nnow."},"96":{"dur":1,"text":"So, we have a bowl here."},"97":{"dur":1,"text":"We are going to whisk this all together."},"99":{"dur":2,"text":"I have five eggs and there are no shell."},"101":{"dur":2,"text":"Unfortunately my little girl, which sometimes\nhelps me out in the kitchen cooking, she gets"},"104":{"dur":1,"text":"a bit of shell in."},"105":{"dur":1,"text":"Added crunch, but not today."},"107":{"dur":1,"text":"Cream."},"108":{"dur":3,"text":"280 ml of cream going in and if you want to\nhave a go at making this, which I really hope"},"111":{"dur":3,"text":"you do, do not forget to check out the description\nbox below for the method and the full ingredients."},"115":{"dur":1,"text":"Good times."},"116":{"dur":2,"text":"So, in goes our milk with that cream and eggs."},"118":{"dur":4,"text":"We are just going to give that a little beat\ntogether, then we can add in our cheese, pepper,"},"123":{"dur":3,"text":"salt, and a little bit of paprika -- just\nto give it a little bit of spank."},"126":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I want to be careful not to over-whisk\nthis, because we are not making scrambled"},"130":{"dur":1,"text":"egg."},"131":{"dur":1,"text":"But just make sure those yolks are broken\ndown."},"132":{"dur":3,"text":"What we will do now is pour in our cheese,\nor just dump it, like that."},"135":{"dur":1,"text":"OK."},"136":{"dur":1,"text":"So just dump in your cheese."},"137":{"dur":2,"text":"A little bit of salt -- this is Maldon salt,\nwhich is quite flashy."},"140":{"dur":1,"text":"So, you can do that."},"141":{"dur":1,"text":"Do you like that?"},"142":{"dur":1,"text":"It is kind of cool."},"143":{"dur":1,"text":"A grinding of pepper."},"144":{"dur":2,"text":"[funny sound] As much or as little as you\nlike."},"147":{"dur":2,"text":"Remember, this is the best way to get all\nof that flavor in there."},"149":{"dur":3,"text":"You have all of that flavor in that pan there,\nbut this is your real chance to make all of"},"152":{"dur":1,"text":"those little tweaks that are going to make\nit your own."},"154":{"dur":2,"text":"My grandparents are just right there right\nnow."},"156":{"dur":3,"text":"A little bit of paprika -- about a heaped\nteaspoon of that."},"159":{"dur":3,"text":"We will mix this all through, get it nice\nand incorporated."},"163":{"dur":1,"text":"Oh yeah, baby."},"164":{"dur":1,"text":"I have half of my mixture here."},"166":{"dur":2,"text":"It is getting a bit emotional because its\nfriend is over there but they will join back"},"168":{"dur":1,"text":"again any minute now."},"169":{"dur":3,"text":"I am going to push that into our eggy, creamy\nmixture."},"173":{"dur":2,"text":"Just to incorporate it in, I am going to mix\nit through."},"175":{"dur":1,"text":"And you will notice I have a pastry case here."},"177":{"dur":1,"text":"This is not one of those pre, store-bought\nones."},"178":{"dur":2,"text":"I got some ready-made pastry, baked it."},"180":{"dur":2,"text":"I got some little baking beads, which are\nlike the coolest things in the world."},"183":{"dur":3,"text":"It is kind of like the second best thing after\nbubble wrap -- baked it and I made a little"},"186":{"dur":3,"text":"golf-ball design (which you can do, if the\npastry is still soft)."},"190":{"dur":1,"text":"Right."},"191":{"dur":1,"text":"So, we have our mixture here."},"192":{"dur":6,"text":"What we are going to do is pour it into our\nflan like so -- our little tray, dishy thing."},"198":{"dur":1,"text":"And it goes like so."},"199":{"dur":1,"text":"Right."},"200":{"dur":2,"text":"So now I am just spooning it all in, filling\nin the gaps."},"202":{"dur":2,"text":"There is quite a bit of fluid there and these\nheavy bits want to stay at the bottom."},"205":{"dur":1,"text":"So I am just filling it in all around."},"206":{"dur":3,"text":"So, it is still going to increase that volume\nand now we can start to make it look all nice"},"210":{"dur":3,"text":"and pretty with the spinach, ham, and mushroom\nall scattered around."},"213":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is the chance now where you can take\nthings from your pan, like your spinach, and"},"217":{"dur":1,"text":"just sort of stagger it all out and make it\nlook all good."},"219":{"dur":2,"text":"Remember, this is just one type of filling\nfor a quiche."},"221":{"dur":1,"text":"So, what would you put in your quiche?"},"223":{"dur":1,"text":"Let me know down below."},"224":{"dur":1,"text":"I'd love to know."},"225":{"dur":3,"text":"Once you have it looking all nice and pretty,\ngive it one last final seasoning -- so, a"},"228":{"dur":1,"text":"good grinding of black pepper on there."},"230":{"dur":2,"text":"And now you want to put in in the over for\na good half an hour for that mixture to all"},"233":{"dur":1,"text":"set together."},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"If, around the edges, it starts to get a bit\nbrown while it Is baking, you can put some"},"237":{"dur":1,"text":"tin foil on that to stop it from happening."},"238":{"dur":1,"text":"In an ideal world, it shouldn't happen."},"240":{"dur":3,"text":"But, let us get it in there and see what it\ncomes out like."},"243":{"dur":1,"text":"Wow."},"244":{"dur":2,"text":"Spank my bum and call me Harry Styles."},"246":{"dur":1,"text":"And maybe it should be \"Barry\" Styles."},"247":{"dur":1,"text":"There is only one direction this is going\nin."},"249":{"dur":1,"text":"And that, my friends, is my stomach."},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"If you enjoyed this video, don't
