and so it feels very ancient."},"40":{"dur":1,"text":"The world was really different."},"41":{"dur":4,"text":"The tools I had available to me to do that and to start are

engage with you and answer your questions."},"63":{"dur":3,"text":"So let me start off with how I started Buzz."},"66":{"dur":3,"text":"So I never ever thought I would be an entrepreneur."},"69":{"dur":5,"text":"In 1996 that was not a word that was really kind of known to me."},"75":{"dur":2,"text":"I always thought I would be a beauty editor."},"77":{"dur":4,"text":"So I was very focused on fashion and beauty and I wanted to be"},"81":{"dur":4,"text":"an editor at primarily a teen girl magazine kind of like 17."},"86":{"dur":5,"text":"And so, at 16, I applied for a job with the newspaper for Girls out"},"91":{"dur":4,"text":"of New York City called The New Girl Times and at the Times I primarily"},"96":{"dur":5,"text":"wrote product reviews focused on - my first

tell me what you think?"},"115":{"dur":2,"text":"And at 16, I thought that was the coolest thing ever."},"117":{"dur":1,"text":"I thought there that there were tens of companies"},"118":{"dur":1,"text":"who would send me products if I just told them what"},"120":{"dur":2,"text":"I thought and so I thought that was the gig."},"123":{"dur":2,"text":"I didn't think it was a way to make money."},"125":{"dur":3,"text":"It was something I became really passionate about and even at 34,"},"129":{"dur":2,"text":"I still - I'm so passionate about trends,"},"131":{"dur":2,"text":"about new things, about whether it's reading about"},"134":{"dur":2,"text":"a new destination in Conde Nast Traveller,"},"136":{"dur":2,"text":"it's something that still fuels me today;"},"138":{"dur":4,"text":"the idea that there are so many new products to try, so little time."},"143":{"dur":6,"text":"So back in '96, I remember a lot of PR-type people who were"},"150":{"dur":3,"text":"my 'clients' and I started getting phone calls like"},"153":{"dur":2,"text":"\"I have a friend, she works on this brand."},"156":{"dur":1,"text":"You'd be really cool to talk to.\""},"157":{"dur":2,"text":"And I didn't really understand what the conversation would be."},"160":{"dur":4,"text":"I was literally a suburban teenage girl and I should - I guess -"},"165":{"dur":4,"text":"go back and say I am the oldest of six children and so the"},"169":{"dur":2,"text":"eight of us where I was kind of the odd kid doing this interesting"},"172":{"dur":3,"text":"thing and since all of my siblings have really interesting"},"176":{"dur":1,"text":"careers and do really interesting things,"},"177":{"dur":2,"text":"but at the time it was something very different and very new and so"},"180":{"dur":4,"text":"my parents were like why is UPS - why are UPS and Fedex here everyday?"},"184":{"dur":2,"text":"So no one really got what was going on."},"186":{"dur":1,"text":"I didn't really get what was going on."},"188":{"dur":3,"text":"But it was happening really quickly and so by the time I was 17,"},"192":{"dur":1,"text":"I had about 40 clients and,"},"194":{"dur":4,"text":"again, I use that word very loosely because I hadn't yet had that"},"198":{"dur":3,"text":"moment where I realized I could make money doing what I was doing."},"202":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I started to recruit my friends and say"},"205":{"dur":1,"text":"if I gave you guys some of these products,"},"207":{"dur":2,"text":"can we all review them and I will tally our scores and"},"210":{"dur":4,"text":"I will send this little report back to our client and so that"},"215":{"dur":2,"text":"works for a while and then my friends would say well,"},"218":{"dur":3,"text":"I have a cousin in Texas and she would love to be one of the your"},"221":{"dur":3,"text":"trend spotters and again think about the time we're talking about."},"225":{"dur":2,"text":"I said, well, how would I communicate with her?"},"227":{"dur":3,"text":"I had just gotten an AOL email address at 16."},"231":{"dur":3,"text":"So the idea of technology and connectivity wasn't"},"235":{"dur":2,"text":"something that was yet really relevant,"},"237":{"dur":1,"text":"I think, at that time."},"239":{"dur":3,"text":"And the way to communicate, the way our network communicates today,"},"243":{"dur":2,"text":"didn't really make sense at that time."},"245":{"dur":4,"text":"So continued pretty small until I got to college"},"250":{"dur":3,"text":"and as a freshman in college I had two real important"},"253":{"dur":1,"text":"things that happened at the same time."},"255":{"dur":3,"text":"First, I took my intro to business course at Hood College;"},"258":{"dur":3,"text":"I went to a womens' school, Hood College in Frederick, Maryland."},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"And I took an intro to business with the Head of the Department"},"264":{"dur":4,"text":"and at the same time I was working on one of these reports for"},"268":{"dur":3,"text":"a fashion company and my client at the time called and she said"},"272":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to tell you something really important."},"273":{"dur":1,"text":"I just received your report,"},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"I reviewed it with my team and yours is 10 times"},"278":{"dur":3,"text":"better than a report we paid $25,000 for."},"281":{"dur":1,"text":"You have a business,"},"282":{"dur":1,"text":"it's called market research and that's all"},"284":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to tell you, go figure it out."},"286":{"dur":3,"text":"And so during office hours I went into Dr. Jose's office,"},"289":{"dur":2,"text":"I said here is what I've been doing for the last 2.5 years."},"292":{"dur":0,"text":"What do you think?"},"293":{"dur":3,"text":"And she took some time and kind of just stared at me for a while and"},"296":{"dur":2,"text":"then she said I want you to take an independent study with me next"},"299":{"dur":2,"text":"semester and let's see if we can't make this a real business."},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I was really fortunate at that"},"304":{"dur":3,"text":"time to - like I always tell Dr. Jose,"},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"I got beat up for 13 weeks in a row into"},"310":{"dur":1,"text":"creating a business and marketing plan,"},"312":{"dur":2,"text":"but I still use those plans today."},"314":{"dur":1,"text":"And I was really fortunate,"},"316":{"dur":1,"text":"because when I was in college at that time,"},"317":{"dur":3,"text":"so I think '97 to probably spring of '98,"},"321":{"dur":3,"text":"it was right around that like .com"},"324":{"dur":3,"text":"boom and so when Dr. Jose and I talked,"},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"she said I don't want you to get caught up in what"},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"at that point seemed to be a kind of trend."},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"She was like I want you to build a business that's a solid"},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"business and if there is a digital component that's great,"},"337":{"dur":2,"text":"but you've got to build a solid business and there"},"340":{"dur":2,"text":"were - I mean I try - to help you understand what was"},"342":{"dur":1,"text":"happening at this time in the Internet,"},"344":{"dur":2,"text":"there were websites like quepasa.com"},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"that were raising $50 million and then"},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"went bust a couple months later."},"350":{"dur":3,"text":"So it was very different than I think kind of the builder moment,"},"354":{"dur":1,"text":"that's happening now and in a little bit I will"},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"get into some of the trends we're studying."},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I understood okay,"},"361":{"dur":3,"text":"I need to build this solid business and I was really fortunate"},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"that when I needed to understand statistics I could go and"},"367":{"dur":3,"text":"talk to a professor and if I needed to understand how psychology"},"371":{"dur":1,"text":"and sociology played into my business,"},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"there were people that were available for me to talk to."},"376":{"dur":2,"text":"So of course I am a big advocate of building"},"378":{"dur":2,"text":"businesses while you are in school."},"381":{"dur":3,"text":"I think that I always say my education definitely worked for me."},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"And it was really important for me to actively"},"388":{"dur":2,"text":"be a student and also build this business,"},"391":{"dur":4,"text":"and so I can - I worked with Dr. Jose and realized okay,"},"396":{"dur":3,"text":"I have services, now I can make money and started working"},"400":{"dur":4,"text":"really hard at recruiting clients and by the end of my"},"404":{"dur":2,"text":"college career I was working with Verizon Wireless."},"407":{"dur":3,"text":"I remember spring of my senior year doing a research project for them"},"410":{"dur":3,"text":"and flying to California and back to school for class and"},"413":{"dur":3,"text":"I spent my junior year instead of staying abroad, I studied away."},"417":{"dur":1,"text":"Lived and worked in Chicago,"},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"which I really found to be kind of the Mecca for marketing"},"421":{"dur":3,"text":"and so at 22 I'd had a lot of experience."},"424":{"dur":3,"text":"At this point, six years of running this business and I still"},"427":{"dur":3,"text":"thought maybe this was just a really interesting hobby."},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"I didn't actually think this was going to be my"},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"career for as long this has been my career."},"436":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I still remember the conversation"},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"with my advisor when I said oh,"},"440":{"dur":3,"text":"I had just watched legally blonde - I was just talking about this last"},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"week in another conference and thought I should go to law school."},"446":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't know people who like fashion and"},"448":{"dur":1,"text":"beauty go to law school, I don't know."},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"I remember her just saying yes,"},"451":{"dur":3,"text":"you could go to law school because you're a very good student."},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"And not knowing that this is what I wanted to do,"},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"and I had been getting some media and I thought that"},"460":{"dur":4,"text":"the media was focused on my story of being this interesting"},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"girl doing this interesting thing."},"466":{"dur":1,"text":"And even at that age,"},"468":{"dur":4,"text":"at 21, I didn't think that was the way to build a business;"},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"so focused on one person, one story."},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"And I also didn't think it was the right story."},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"I didn't think it was the right message because at some point"},"479":{"dur":3,"text":"you have to grow up and you have to be respected as a research"},"482":{"dur":3,"text":"company or whatever is that we were becoming not there is this"},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"school girl that does this cool stuff with the product;"},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"I felt like there was a timeline on that."},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I said to my advisor,"},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"we really talked, spent quite a bit of time in different"},"496":{"dur":1,"text":"sessions talking about should I go to law school,"},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"should I do vastly different things,"},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"should I go into the field and just apply for a job."},"504":{"dur":4,"text":"And I remember my girl friends senior year reading like this"},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"book on quarter life crisis and it was really funny."},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"They were like oh, you of course don't need to read this book."},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm like: I probably have the biggest crisis here of everybody."},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"But I decided, I said to my advisor at the time,"},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"I said here is what I'm going to do."},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that - when I graduated,"},"524":{"dur":3,"text":"it was spring 2002, and illegal downloading had become"},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"a major issue or it was becoming kind of thing."},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, it was the Shawn Fanning movement and that sort of thing."},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"And during the spring of my senior year,"},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"I spoke at a music industry conference."},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"It was a very interesting conference because there"},"542":{"dur":2,"text":"were three other presenters from really,"},"544":{"dur":3,"text":"really big research institutions and they were saying"},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"things to the audience who you can imagine,"},"550":{"dur":3,"text":"were people who were quite concerned about illegal downloading and"},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"they were saying things like: it's not going to be an issue,"},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"only 17% of people illegally download music."},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"And then I get up, this senior in college"},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"who has a research panel at that time,"},"567":{"dur":3,"text":"I should back up and say our network grew to 9,000 people"},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"solely because CosmoGirl Magazine wrote two sentences"},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"about what I was doing and I got 15,000 applications"},"576":{"dur":1,"text":"from people all over the world who wanted to be"},"578":{"dur":4,"text":"buzzSpotters and so we really created this great network."},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"And we had done research and found"},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"of the 500 people that we surveyed,"},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"that 99% of them had illegally downloaded"},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"music within the last 30 days."},"590":{"dur":3,"text":"And so obviously we were presenting two very,"},"594":{"dur":5,"text":"very different sets of data and so I kind of was disheartened,"},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"I was cut out of an article and billboard and I thought okay,"},"602":{"dur":1,"text":"well that is what it is."},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"And so back to that conversation with Dr. Weinberg,"},"608":{"dur":1,"text":"I said, you know what I want to do,"},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"I want to - I have always wanted to be a liaison"},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"between consumers and people who target them."},"614":{"dur":3,"text":"And at the time it was teens and then as I grew"},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"older it was the young adults and now I'm 34,"},"620":{"dur":3,"text":"so we jut say consumers and people who market to them."},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"And I said well, I want to talk about things"},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"that other people don't want to talk about."},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"And I don't have any skin in the game to necessarily"},"631":{"dur":1,"text":"need to go one direction or prove one thing."},"632":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm really curious as to why consumers do what they do and what"},"636":{"dur":3,"text":"their interests are and so presenting that research was to say,"},"640":{"dur":2,"text":"you might be right, maybe only 17%"},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"of people illegally download music,"},"644":{"dur":3,"text":"I just have a belief that the 99% that are in this demographic"},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm dealing with have a really huge impact."},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"And, obviously we know now that that did have"},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"an incredible impact on that business."},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"I think still today it is impacting the music"},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"business and how that business is shaped now."},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, yes, that's always my example of the power of Millennials"},"664":{"dur":2,"text":"and the power of consumers when they decide"},"667":{"dur":1,"text":"that something is or is not working for them."},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, I decided I was going to try that out for a year."},"673":{"dur":3,"text":"I opened an office in New York City and I work there."},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"I lived in South Jersey and I still live in South Jersey today,"},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"and so did that for three or four years."},"681":{"dur":4,"text":"And I guess that most interesting thing that happened during"},"685":{"dur":4,"text":"that time was I was featured in a cover story for O Magazine."},"690":{"dur":4,"text":"And so at 25, having that Oprah stamp"},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"of approval on my career was huge."},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"I didn't think it would be."},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"Not that I didn't think the Oprah brand was huge;"},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"I just didn't think anybody cared about a"},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"kid who was doing research in New Jersey."},"704":{"dur":3,"text":"I just didn't think that was a story that would resonate with people and"},"707":{"dur":4,"text":"obviously if you're lucky enough to be touched by the Oprah brand,"},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"it does turn to gold if you're doing something good."},"714":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, it was great for us and I still remember clients"},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"coming into the office like with my actual page from"},"720":{"dur":2,"text":"the Magazine kind of like we saw this and so,"},"723":{"dur":4,"text":"that was great for our agency and I think we kind of - again other"},"728":{"dur":5,"text":"profiles and 30 under 30 and all kinds of awards which for me"},"733":{"dur":1,"text":"and I think you'd understand if you're an entrepreneur,"},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"you have to be fascinated by your work and passionate about"},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"it and the other stuff is just stuff that happens."},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not something you pause - and I think my mom,"},"744":{"dur":4,"text":"I realized recently has a clip book of all of my different media,"},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"but for me it was just this is another day and it's"},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"another day that I get to do something that I love."},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, we continued to grow the network,"},"756":{"dur":4,"text":"continued with our research and then the economy took a turn,"},"760":{"dur":1,"text":"which was interesting because what happened"},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"is our business really diversified."},"765":{"dur":4,"text":"So we got into influence of marketing, again, by accident."},"769":{"dur":3,"text":"I had a client call and say the girls I talk to about beauty"},"773":{"dur":3,"text":"were having some issues launching a product at Sephora,"},"776":{"dur":1,"text":"do you think we could engage them in influencer?"},"778":{"dur":3,"text":"And this was probably about 2007,"},"781":{"dur":4,"text":"so I don't think - it was right around the time BuzzAgent was"},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"coming along and I thought I don't know that we're that."},"788":{"dur":5,"text":"I've always really wanted that line of consumers being able to openly"},"793":{"dur":3,"text":"and honestly express their opinions to brands and that was a really-and"},"796":{"dur":3,"text":"still is-a very core value of our company and very important to me."},"800":{"dur":3,"text":"So that means if I have to say something that's not great,"},"803":{"dur":1,"text":"that that has to be okay."},"804":{"dur":4,"text":"And that also is a big reason why I don't have a team of 50,"},"809":{"dur":3,"text":"60, 70 people because sometimes I do have to make decisions that"},"812":{"dur":3,"text":"I think are a little more ethically driven for our business."},"815":{"dur":4,"text":"And so at that time I wasn't sure it would work and we"},"819":{"dur":2,"text":"tried influencer and it worked really, really well."},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we incorporated that into our services"},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"and so when the economy took a turn,"},"827":{"dur":2,"text":"it was a lot of traditional things that were getting"},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"cut and people were reinvesting into the type of work"},"832":{"dur":4,"text":"we do and so we have over the last 18 years,"},"837":{"dur":4,"text":"worked with 135 companies and I guess some highlights for"},"841":{"dur":2,"text":"me would be companies like American Eagle Outfitters,"},"844":{"dur":3,"text":"Sony Music, Dell, Microsoft,"},"847":{"dur":3,"text":"and so we've gotten to touch some really big brands"},"850":{"dur":2,"text":"and I've learned so much from our clients."},"853":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'd say personally for me,"},"856":{"dur":2,"text":"one of the more fun accomplishments - a lot"},"858":{"dur":1,"text":"of people talk about my business book,"},"860":{"dur":1,"text":"but not so much about my children series."},"862":{"dur":3,"text":"So I write a series for 7 to 12 year old girls."},"865":{"dur":2,"text":"It's published by HarperCollins Children's Books,"},"867":{"dur":1,"text":"it's called Mackenzie Blue."},"869":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's really focused on a girl I think is kind of like"},"872":{"dur":3,"text":"a modern Ramona and I've written five books in the series."},"875":{"dur":2,"text":"We have sold over 200,000 copies."},"877":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's a really fun - I feel like it's my fun passion project."},"882":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm working on another series right now."},"885":{"dur":2,"text":"It's all about a girl who can't tell a lie and what happens"},"887":{"dur":4,"text":"in middle school and so writing and creating McKenzie"},"892":{"dur":3,"text":"and creating a character that is really beloved by girls"},"895":{"dur":1,"text":"has been an interesting experience for me,"},"897":{"dur":3,"text":"especially as a researcher, because through McKenzie,"},"900":{"dur":3,"text":"through her life, I get to see girls react to her and really"},"904":{"dur":2,"text":"get to understand kind of what's going on in the life of a 12-year-old"},"907":{"dur":2,"text":"girl and that was something really interesting."},"909":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I guess as a final comment before"},"912":{"dur":2,"text":"I open it up to your questions."},"914":{"dur":3,"text":"Two years ago, I was elected to"},"918":{"dur":2,"text":"the United Nations Foundations Global Entrepreneurs Council."},"920":{"dur":4,"text":"And so we are charged with bringing innovative ideas to the UN."},"925":{"dur":2,"text":"And if I weren't working for myself,"},"928":{"dur":3,"text":"I'd absolutely love to work for the UN and so"},"931":{"dur":1,"text":"it's been a really incredible experience."},"933":{"dur":1,"text":"That's why I'm actually in San Francisco now."},"935":{"dur":1,"text":"I have a board meeting,"},"936":{"dur":3,"text":"it's our last, and so it's just been an unbelievable"},"940":{"dur":2,"text":"experience for me for the last two years,"},"942":{"dur":2,"text":"and earlier this year I got to spend some time in Uganda."},"945":{"dur":4,"text":"I got to visit a refugee settlement and meet entrepreneurs."},"950":{"dur":4,"text":"And when I think about what entrepreneurship means to me now at 34,"},"954":{"dur":3,"text":"a bit more established and kind of what your opportunity is."},"957":{"dur":2,"text":"When I started out, there were not a lot of tools"},"960":{"dur":3,"text":"and there weren't a lot of people that could help"},"964":{"dur":2,"text":"other people rationalize what I was doing."},"966":{"dur":2,"text":"You guys live in a world where everybody"},"968":{"dur":1,"text":"knows who Mark Zuckerberg is,"},"970":{"dur":2,"text":"everybody knows what it means to be an entrepreneur"},"973":{"dur":2,"text":"and everybody understands the upside."},"975":{"dur":1,"text":"When I was doing it,"},"977":{"dur":1,"text":"I was that girl doing that weird thing and people were"},"979":{"dur":2,"text":"saying to my parents your daughter is so smart,"},"981":{"dur":1,"text":"why isn't she a lawyer or a doctor?"},"983":{"dur":6,"text":"They just didn't get it and so I'm now members of many different associations"},"989":{"dur":3,"text":"that didn't exist when I started and so I think that the entrepreneurial"},"993":{"dur":4,"text":"spirit and especially what I got to see in Uganda has really made me"},"997":{"dur":3,"text":"an even bigger champion of entrepreneurship."},"1001":{"dur":4,"text":"Seeing innovation that can drive and create business opportunities"},"1006":{"dur":5,"text":"in Uganda and meeting female entrepreneurs who are creating"},"1011":{"dur":2,"text":"an amazing life for their children that are able to send"},"1014":{"dur":4,"text":"their children to private schools just because they're

there was a particular one I saw call"},"1114":{"dur":2,"text":"the Merchants of Cool where Sprite actually said,"},"1116":{"dur":3,"text":"we project onto you the image of who we want you to

with this consumer and the people who wanted"},"1212":{"dur":2,"text":"to dictate to them weren't people that would work with my system"},"1215":{"dur":3,"text":"anyway because the consumer and that

saying,"},"1231":{"dur":1,"text":"we probably wouldn't the best match."},"1233":{"dur":4,"text":"So I think that earlier in my career it was something that probably"},"1237":{"dur":3,"text":"came up a

and"},"1296":{"dur":4,"text":"one source and get everything you need is very antiquated."},"1300":{"dur":4,"text":"There was a time when people would produce a trend report and

piece,"},"1311":{"dur":3,"text":"consumers are - it's so fascinating to me."},"1315":{"dur":4,"text":"Think about when fashion blogging became a thing, right."},"1319":{"dur":3,"text":"So think about a magazine like Lucky that when you open Lucky today"},"1322":{"dur":4,"text":"I feel like fashion bloggers drive that book where years ago it was"},"1327":{"dur":3,"text":"editors dictating to us

there"},"1366":{"dur":3,"text":"are times where I remember seeing two people at an airport"},"1370":{"dur":3,"text":"with Toms and then I remember every other person having"},"1373":{"dur":3,"text":"a pair of Toms and so I'm always looking at that moment,"},"1376":{"dur":3,"text":"that breaker moment when something is really becoming mass."},"1380":{"dur":2,"text":"We had a trend a couple of years

categories."},"1408":{"dur":4,"text":"And I'm talking to someone who is going to be part of a judging"},"1412":{"dur":3,"text":"panel for this project and she said to me you're talking about"},"1416":{"dur":1,"text":"all these companies that are really interesting."},"1417":{"dur":1,"text":"Of course the ones that I like,"},"1418":{"dur":1,"text":"like Warby Parker - I love Warby Parker."},"1420":{"dur":2,"text":"She said what I want to know is if the"},"1423":{"dur":2,"text":"girl in Kansas loves Warby Parker."},"1425":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think that is a great question

huge"},"1434":{"dur":4,"text":"country with so many different opinions and so I try to not"},"1439":{"dur":3,"text":"let one idea dictate when I think something is cool."},"1443":{"dur":3,"text":"And

Millennials,"},"1457":{"dur":1,"text":"my child is a Millennial."},"1458":{"dur":3,"text":"And what I - I always take the approach is that I don't know anything"},"1462":{"dur":3,"text":"and that I think everyday something is changing and everyday"},"1466":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm getting new access to new research and information,"},"1469":{"dur":3,"text":"and so I always try to approach it from

interesting."},"1478":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, I think you have to kind of do the work I do,"},"1482":{"dur":2,"text":"just be very open to learning something new and not - I"},"1484":{"dur":3,"text":"think the most important thing is to not go into it,"},"1487":{"dur":1,"text":"any assignment for me,"},"1489":{"dur":1,"text":"with any pre-conceived notion."},"1490":{"dur":3,"text":"And sometimes I think that's hard with my clients because they"},"1494":{"dur":3,"text":"sometimes arrive at the end and then want me to justify it."},"1498":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that's sometimes creates a dilemma I think."},"1501":{"dur":0,"text":"Okay."},"1504":{"dur":1,"text":"I like that airport story."},"1505":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm just wondering, perhaps on a more personal thing,"},"1508":{"dur":1,"text":"in the past few flights you've gone on,"},"1510":{"dur":1,"text":"what step have you noticed?"},"1512":{"dur":1,"text":"What's

you a bit about the trends"},"1518":{"dur":1,"text":"we're predicting for next year."},"1522":{"dur":3,"text":"I think what I'm noticing lately is what's missing."},"1526":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll give you an example."},"1528":{"dur":4,"text":"I don't think we've figured out a charging solution"},"1532":{"dur":2,"text":"that makes sense for as many devices as we all have."},"1535":{"dur":3,"text":"I see a lot of people crowding around very few outlets,"},"1539":{"dur":2,"text":"so needs of technology."},"1542":{"dur":5,"text":"I see in general airports becoming"},"1548":{"dur":2,"text":"a more interesting hub of shopping and,"},"1551":{"dur":2,"text":"specifically, I can speak to Philadelphia."},"1553":{"dur":3,"text":"It's not a joke that like the best shopping is in the airport."},"1557":{"dur":4,"text":"And so the airport as a destination but just from people in"},"1561":{"dur":2,"text":"general it's that they want to be connected and that we've"},"1564":{"dur":3,"text":"got to figure out how to make that connectivity easier."},"1567":{"dur":3,"text":"When you go to many other places outside of the U.S.,"},"1571":{"dur":2,"text":"it's really easy to get online and to"},"1573":{"dur":2,"text":"have great Wi-Fi and to be online."},"1575":{"dur":4,"text":"And so figuring out that issue and it's funny,"},"1580":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm seeing more problems lately."},"1582":{"dur":3,"text":"I see a problem of food quality in airports and what"},"1585":{"dur":2,"text":"consumers are looking for and what they've access to."},"1588":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think I see kind of more opportunity."},"1591":{"dur":4,"text":"And then in general with consumers, it's very interesting."},"1598":{"dur":2,"text":"There was a time where teenagers were called screenagers,"},"1601":{"dur":2,"text":"because they were looking at so many screens."},"1604":{"dur":2,"text":"And what fascinates me is looking at

were really interesting things were happening."},"1614":{"dur":5,"text":"And so I think watching kind of the non-Millennial engage in technology"},"1619":{"dur":3,"text":"with technology with so many different forms of technology,"},"1622":{"dur":2,"text":"and figuring that out is something that's interesting."},"1625":{"dur":3,"text":"It's to really see how integral it is and that"},"1628":{"dur":1,"text":"I think we're still a little bit behind."},"1630":{"dur":2,"text":"It might probably not be the case here."},"1632":{"dur":4,"text":"But there are places where what consumers need in that space,"},"1636":{"dur":3,"text":"and how connected they want to be and that connectivity"},"1639":{"dur":1,"text":"is not available at that moment."},"1642":{"dur":2,"text":"And in general to your question about other trends,"},"1644":{"dur":6,"text":"so we've got working on our top 10 trends of 2015 right now"},"1650":{"dur":3,"text":"and we're focused on some things like the Makers movement."},"1654":{"dur":3,"text":"And talking to some of our buzzSpotters,"},"1657":{"dur":3,"text":"what's interesting is there are those that consider themselves"},"1660":{"dur":3,"text":"real makers who really make stuff and they are really put"},"1664":{"dur":3,"text":"off by the idea that everybody thinks they're a maker,"},"1667":{"dur":2,"text":"but I just think it's something that's becoming a bigger"},"1670":{"dur":2,"text":"consumer play and we are seeing it in different areas."},"1672":{"dur":3,"text":"I was on my flight over reading an article in Marie Claire,"},"1676":{"dur":2,"text":"when they were talking about how to make the perfect"},"1678":{"dur":2,"text":"palette and you can buy this palette

unglue"},"1686":{"dur":4,"text":"it and create your own palette and so I thought about how"},"1691":{"dur":2,"text":"interesting it is that we deconstruct make-up that we pay"},"1693":{"dur":3,"text":"a lot of money for to create our own custom solution."},"1697":{"dur":4,"text":"And so we've talked a lot about customization"},"1701":{"dur":2,"text":"before and the need for customization,"},"1704":{"dur":3,"text":"but to actually give consumers the ability to make things"},"1707":{"dur":3,"text":"and participate in this different way is something new."},"1711":{"dur":3,"text":"We're talking about this idea of being selfie-conscious"},"1714":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's not at all that Millennials are self-conscious."},"1718":{"dur":3,"text":"It's that I feel like, and through our research we have seen,"},"1721":{"dur":3,"text":"that there is such an emphasis these days on perfection."},"1725":{"dur":2,"text":"There was a time where it was like you could just walk out,"},"1728":{"dur":1,"text":"looking however you looked."},"1729":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean I went to college at a time where girls were"},"1732":{"dur":2,"text":"going in like pajamas and Uggs or whatever boots"},"1734":{"dur":1,"text":"they were wearing at the time, or Sneakers."},"1736":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, to think of a time now where everyone has to - think of"},"1739":{"dur":3,"text":"your Instagram feed and how good everybody looks all day long."},"1744":{"dur":2,"text":"It's that pressure of you have to look good all day long,"},"1746":{"dur":1,"text":"because there is no filter for that."},"1748":{"dur":1,"text":"And why didn't you get into this top college"},"1750":{"dur":1,"text":"and why aren't you going to this top...?"},"1752":{"dur":2,"text":"And so it's the pressure to be in all the right places"},"1755":{"dur":2,"text":"doing all the right things and looking good and not"},"1757":{"dur":1,"text":"looking stressed that I think we're looking at."},"1759":{"dur":3,"text":"And that data is really important to our clients,"},"1762":{"dur":3,"text":"because as they start to create brand messages it's important to understand"},"1766":{"dur":3,"text":"just what's going on in life for the average Millennial."},"1769":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think we were exploring another trend called Instafeed,"},"1773":{"dur":2,"text":"but I think the team is like moving that into selfieconscious"},"1775":{"dur":2,"text":"where I was looking at the continuous feed that we live in where"},"1778":{"dur":2,"text":"every moment in our life is something we're documenting and not"},"1781":{"dur":3,"text":"just living and how does that affect things in general."},"1784":{"dur":3,"text":"We are talking about fitspiration."},"1788":{"dur":2,"text":"Fitness and wellness, and it's interesting."},"1790":{"dur":2,"text":"Again, I hadn't read Marie Claire in months,"},"1793":{"dur":1,"text":"so I was catching up and listening"},"1794":{"dur":1,"text":"to the - reading this editors letter,"},"1795":{"dur":1,"text":"and she was talking about how they're totally changing"},"1797":{"dur":2,"text":"the health section of the magazine and it's no longer"},"1800":{"dur":2,"text":"about like how to do the perfect crunch,"},"1802":{"dur":3,"text":"it's now about like a much more lifestyle approach to fitness."},"1806":{"dur":2,"text":"And again Instagram has become a big"},"1809":{"dur":1,"text":"inspiration for this kind of thing,"},"1811":{"dur":2,"text":"but thinking about the images of people who are so healthy."},"1813":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, how many people pop up in your feed that are like I am"},"1816":{"dur":4,"text":"working out and people like Jen Salzer or whatever her name is,"},"1821":{"dur":2,"text":"who are in Vanity Fair for how amazing their butt looks."},"1824":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, again, it's the power of image and how"},"1827":{"dur":1,"text":"that's coming across in that medium to say,"},"1829":{"dur":1,"text":"okay, now I have to be fit."},"1830":{"dur":3,"text":"And think of it like soul cycle, whether you go or not,"},"1834":{"dur":1,"text":"you know what this thing is, right."},"1835":{"dur":1,"text":"It's like a cull, right."},"1837":{"dur":1,"text":"I love when workouts are called culls,"},"1839":{"dur":3,"text":"but it means that they're building some kind of brand"},"1842":{"dur":2,"text":"culture that people associate with in some way,"},"1845":{"dur":2,"text":"and so we are looking at that."},"1847":{"dur":2,"text":"We're also exploring net neutrality,"},"1849":{"dur":3,"text":"it's something that's come up over - that's one of"},"1853":{"dur":4,"text":"those moments where I said I never tried to say"},"1857":{"dur":2,"text":"what I think a Millennial will or won't do."},"1859":{"dur":2,"text":"I remember when we did our original research"},"1862":{"dur":1,"text":"on net neutrality and I said,"},"1864":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't even know if this is an issue they even know about."},"1867":{"dur":3,"text":"And I was so wrong, just in - and not only the"},"1871":{"dur":3,"text":"knowledge but also why it was important."},"1875":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think that there is an interesting trend happening now"},"1879":{"dur":3,"text":"where traditionally parents told children what to do, right."},"1883":{"dur":3,"text":"And they were the authority and we've explored this in different trends"},"1886":{"dur":3,"text":"like hand-me-ups where Millennials were actually handing up older"},"1889":{"dur":3,"text":"phones to parents because of shared cell phone plans and the Millennials"},"1893":{"dur":4,"text":"were getting the better technology and there is also this divide where"},"1897":{"dur":5,"text":"they're also explaining technology and that's something that's become"},"1903":{"dur":1,"text":"a really interesting thing to explore, right."},"1905":{"dur":2,"text":"When you think of very traditional companies,"},"1907":{"dur":1,"text":"think of like food companies,"},"1909":{"dur":3,"text":"grocery stores, how they talk to consumers about what's important"},"1912":{"dur":3,"text":"and their issue - their image of family and what they project,"},"1915":{"dur":5,"text":"a trend of who - it becomes a lot of like who is the making the main"},"1921":{"dur":4,"text":"decisions in the household and so exploring that kind of trend."},"1927":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm trying to think if there is anything"},"1929":{"dur":1,"text":"else that's really interesting."},"1931":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, that's a preview so far."},"1933":{"dur":6,"text":"I think I like selfieconscious, I like looking at what that means,"},"1940":{"dur":3,"text":"and looking at how also, to your question of ethics,"},"1943":{"dur":4,"text":"are we as marketers putting that pressure there to look perfect"},"1948":{"dur":3,"text":"and saying that perfection has never been more affordable."},"1951":{"dur":3,"text":"You can dye your hair in 10 minutes, why would your roots be showing?"},"1954":{"dur":1,"text":"It's so easy to fix."},"1955":{"dur":3,"text":"As we create really easy fixes to things I think"},"1959":{"dur":3,"text":"we also don't allow room for imperfection."},"1962":{"dur":6,"text":"And so, that is creating - it becomes a predictor of will you,"},"1968":{"dur":3,"text":"as a generation, pushback on that."},"1972":{"dur":5,"text":"I think we also look at your position on government,"},"1978":{"dur":2,"text":"and this has been a really interesting thing."},"1980":{"dur":4,"text":"We pull this a lot and we found that in general Millennials"},"1985":{"dur":1,"text":"might be a little more centrist than people think."},"1987":{"dur":2,"text":"When we did research five or six years ago,"},"1990":{"dur":2,"text":"the percentage of Millennials that said that they were"},"1992":{"dur":5,"text":"Democrat was much larger than what we are seeing today."},"1997":{"dur":3,"text":"But then also we are looking at the implications"},"2001":{"dur":3,"text":"of - even if they're - number one thing,"},"2004":{"dur":1,"text":"one trend, that's interesting."},"2006":{"dur":1,"text":"They don't identify."},"2007":{"dur":2,"text":"We did two types of identification."},"2009":{"dur":2,"text":"Are you Democrat, are you Republican or are you independent"},"2011":{"dur":1,"text":"or do you think that you are more centrist?"},"2013":{"dur":2,"text":"Like we used different words and got different responses."},"2016":{"dur":3,"text":"And then becomes the idea, totally separate idea,"},"2019":{"dur":3,"text":"that they don't think government is actually working for them"},"2023":{"dur":3,"text":"and in that case they feel like other Millennials or other"},"2026":{"dur":3,"text":"people are better solving problems outside of government."},"2029":{"dur":3,"text":"And MTV has done a lot of research and a lot of work around this,"},"2032":{"dur":4,"text":"and that really creates an interesting
