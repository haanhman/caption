self-portrait\nis that this was a market economy."},"1242":{"dur":4,"text":"If you didn't sell your painting,\nof course, you were in bother,"},"1247":{"dur":3,"text":"so a lot of these artists\nhad second careers."},"1250":{"dur":1,"text":"Rembrandt was a teacher."},"1252":{"dur":1,"text":"He was also an art dealer."},"1253":{"dur":1,"text":"And do go to the Rembrandt

Rembrandt"},"1313":{"dur":1,"text":"has probably been looking along here,"},"1314":{"dur":2,"text":"and he's just turned to look out."},"1317":{"dur":5,"text":"And it gives the painting\nrather more tension than the Titian."},"1322":{"dur":3,"text":"Not only that, but, gosh,\nportraits can be boring, can't they?"},"1326":{"dur":2,"text":"Because they can be rather still and dull,"},"1329":{"dur":3,"text":"only of interest to the family maybe,\nand the sitter."},"1332":{"dur":3,"text":"But what Rembrandt's done\nto make it sort of interesting"},"1336":{"dur":5,"text":"is

shape."},"1347":{"dur":1,"text":"And then you look at the background,"},"1349":{"dur":2,"text":"and the background actually changes."},"1352":{"dur":5,"text":"One of the things that artists often do\nis to manipulate the background,"},"1357":{"dur":3,"text":"so you have an outline\nthat is found and lost."},"1361":{"dur":3,"text":"For instance, down here, it disappears."},"1365":{"dur":4,"text":"Almost so we can't see the outline"},"1370":{"dur":3,"text":"of his wonderful striped tabard."},"1373":{"dur":2,"text":"On the other side, it's much lighter."},"1377":{"dur":3,"text":"Down here,\nthere's a wonderful contrast again."},"1380":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you look at,\nfor instance, his hair,"},"1382":{"dur":2,"text":"at one point,\nit disappears into his beret."},"1385":{"dur":3,"text":"It is a beret, and you can't see the top,\nbecause he's sort of turned it up,"},"1390":{"dur":4,"text":"rather rakishly, rather like, you

Rembrandt"},"1402":{"dur":1,"text":"are the textures."},"1405":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, his painting\nis relatively smooth at this period."},"1409":{"dur":6,"text":"It was a kind of painting that the Dutch\ncall fijnschilder, fine painting."},"1416":{"dur":4,"text":"It's not as textured\nas his late works were."},"1420":{"dur":2,"text":"Nevertheless,\nyou can see some wonderful textures,"},"1423":{"dur":2,"text":"and round here, in the nape of the neck,"},"1425":{"dur":2,"text":"he's done that familiar Rembrandt thing"},"1428":{"dur":2,"text":"of taking the wrong end of the brush,"},"1430":{"dur":2,"text":"and scratching into the soft paint,"},"1432":{"dur":1,"text":"to actually create..."},"1434":{"dur":2,"text":"Yes, it's difficult to see,"},"1436":{"dur":2,"text":"but, nevertheless, that's what he's done."},"1439":{"dur":6,"text":"So, he's playing off the fur\nagainst the linen shirt."},"1445":{"dur":1,"text":"He's playing off the..."},"1447":{"dur":3,"text":"Do have a look at the hand,\nbecause the hand has just moved."},"1450":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a kind of softness about it there."},"1454":{"dur":5,"text":"So, there's that feeling\nthat he is turning round and searching."},"1459":{"dur":1,"text":"Those eyes are searching."},"1461":{"dur":5,"text":"It is quite extraordinary the way\nhe actually looks at us."},"1466":{"dur":2,"text":"And one of the things\nthat Rembrandt does again and again,"},"1469":{"dur":2,"text":"he will put one eye in shadow."},"1471":{"dur":3,"text":"And one of the things about shadow\nis it pulls you in, doesn't it?"},"1475":{"dur":2,"text":"It's like having a shadow\nat the back of a garden."},"1477":{"dur":3,"text":"So, we look towards that eye."},"1482":{"dur":3,"text":"And the eyes are slightly different."},"1486":{"dur":4,"text":"Rembrandt played around\nwith his facial hair,"},"1490":{"dur":2,"text":"because in the etching\nmade just before this,"},"1493":{"dur":1,"text":"he's got a kind of Van Dyke beard,"},"1495":{"dur":2,"text":"but that's rather disappeared here."},"1497":{"dur":4,"text":"Not only that, but sometimes\nhe had kind of a lock of hair,"},"1501":{"dur":3,"text":"which the aristocrats used to wear."},"1505":{"dur":2,"text":"He didn't have one,\nbut he would put it in his paintings."},"1508":{"dur":3,"text":"So, although this is realistic,"},"1512":{"dur":4,"text":"it's sort of looking both ways\ninto fantasy and to realism."},"1518":{"dur":4,"text":"Why Rembrandt, I think,\nmakes such a wonderful self-portrait,"},"1522":{"dur":2,"text":"or, indeed, a wonderful painting,"},"1524":{"dur":2,"text":"is sort of texture."},"1527":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, if you were\nto put your hand across it,"},"1529":{"dur":1,"text":"it's very, very smooth,"},"1531":{"dur":1,"text":"but it hasn't got a mask."},"1532":{"dur":3,"text":"If you look at some portraits,\nit's almost a smooth mask,"},"1536":{"dur":3,"text":"and you feel you cannot penetrate\nbeyond that mask."},"1539":{"dur":2,"text":"He was greatly influenced by Caravaggio,"},"1542":{"dur":2,"text":"although\nhe wouldn't have seen an original,"},"1544":{"dur":3,"text":"And with Caravaggio,\nthe drama comes from the gestures,"},"1547":{"dur":2,"text":"the relationship between the figures,\nthe lighting,"},"1550":{"dur":3,"text":"but, quite often, I feel,\nyou can't get inside the spirit,"},"1554":{"dur":2,"text":"because\nof the very smooth way of painting."},"1556":{"dur":2,"text":"This is relatively rough."},"1559":{"dur":3,"text":"It's as though the pores are open,"},"1562":{"dur":3,"text":"and you can actually get into the man."},"1567":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't know if you agree with me\nin that way."},"1569":{"dur":4,"text":"But, for me, what is superb\nis this extremely limited palette."},"1575":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, the skin tone is white."},"1577":{"dur":4,"text":"A yellow with a little red ochre,\na sort of dull red,"},"1582":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's it."},"1584":{"dur":1,"text":"He creates a blue."},"1585":{"dur":3,"text":"You'll notice there's a blue\ndown the side here, where he's shaved,"},"1589":{"dur":1,"text":"under the eyes slightly."},"1590":{"dur":1,"text":"There is no blue there."},"1592":{"dur":3,"text":"He manipulates the paint,\nmaking it thick and thin."},"1595":{"dur":5,"text":"If it's very thin and goes over,\nit must have white in it,"},"1600":{"dur":3,"text":"goes over a darker ground, as it's called,"},"1604":{"dur":1,"text":"it can go slightly blue."},"1607":{"dur":2,"text":"Something we see in Vel\u00e1zquez."},"1609":{"dur":6,"text":"You know how smoke looks blue\nagainst a dark wall, for instance."},"1616":{"dur":3,"text":"It's that same physical attribute."},"1621":{"dur":4,"text":"So, he is the master of oil paint."},"1625":{"dur":1,"text":"They're not all great masters, are they?"},"1627":{"dur":2,"text":"We think of Leonardo,\nwhose experiments in oil paint"},"1630":{"dur":2,"text":"were not always entirely successful."},"1635":{"dur":4,"text":"So, there were two attitudes\ntowards portrait painting,"},"1639":{"dur":2,"text":"and one of the problems is\nthere are so many portraits."},"1643":{"dur":5,"text":"And one of the great writers at the time,\nthe Dutch Vasari,"},"1649":{"dur":2,"text":"was a man called Karel van Mander,"},"1651":{"dur":3,"text":"and he said in his Schilderboek,\nthe book of painting,"},"1655":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Portraiture is merely a side road to art."},"1659":{"dur":2,"text":"\"It's a thirst for easy money.\""},"1662":{"dur":3,"text":"Is that what this is? I don't think so."},"1665":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going to go back\nto Constantijn Huygens,"},"1668":{"dur":4,"text":"who said that, \"A portrait is\na miraculous digest of the whole man,"},"1673":{"dur":1,"text":"\"both in body and spirit.\""},"1675":{"dur":3,"text":"And, for me, that's exactly what that is."},"1678":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you very much."}}
