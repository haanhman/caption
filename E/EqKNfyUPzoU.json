exist,\nit need never ever progress."},"30":{"dur":2,"text":"This is a food borne illness."},"34":{"dur":4,"text":"My story begins, actually,\nin the late 1970s, early 80s,"},"38":{"dur":3,"text":"when I was chairman of the breast cancer\ntask force at the Cleveland Clinic."},"42":{"dur":3,"text":"My frustration was that no matter\nfor how many women"},"46":{"dur":4,"text":"I was doing breast surgery, I was doing\nnothing for the next unsuspecting victim."},"53":{"dur":2,"text":"This led to a bit of global research."},"56":{"dur":3,"text":"It was quite striking to find\nthat breast cancer rates in Kenya"},"60":{"dur":3,"text":"were something like 30 or 40 times\nless frequent than in the United States."},"64":{"dur":4,"text":"And if you looked at breast cancer rates\nin rural Japan in the 1950s,"},"70":{"dur":2,"text":"it was very infrequently identified."},"72":{"dur":5,"text":"And yet as

entire nation of Japan,"},"93":{"dur":3,"text":"how many autopsy proven deaths\nwere there from cancer of the prostate?"},"97":{"dur":1,"text":"18."},"99":{"dur":3,"text":"That's the most mind-boggling public\nhealth figure I think I've ever heard."},"103":{"dur":1,"text":"But I made a decision then,"},"105":{"dur":2,"text":"that I was concerned\nthat my bones would long be dust"},"107":{"dur":4,"text":"before I could really get answers\nbetween nutrition and cancer."},"112":{"dur":4,"text":"And so I chose to deal\nwith cardiovascular disease,"},"116":{"dur":3,"text":"which is the leading killer of women\nand men in Western civilization."},"120":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was quite striking\nthat in this global review"},"123":{"dur":4,"text":"there were a number of cultures,\nby heritage and tradition,"},"128":{"dur":5,"text":"that simply lack\nany cardiovascular disease."},"134":{"dur":1,"text":"They were plant-based."},"136":{"dur":5,"text":"And so with that information\nI came back to Cleveland."},"142":{"dur":5,"text":"And my wife and I decided to go\non this plant-based diet for a year."},"148":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I asked cardiology\nif I could have"},"151":{"dur":2,"text":"about 24 patients, which is the number"},"153":{"dur":3,"text":"that I can handle and still carry out\nmy surgical obligations."},"158":{"dur":3,"text":"And the 24 patients that I received,"},"161":{"dur":3,"text":"were, as my late brother-in-law\nused to say, the walking dead."},"165":{"dur":1,"text":"But they were most cooperative"},"168":{"dur":6,"text":"and it was within about, say,\n15 months of starting this program"},"174":{"dur":2,"text":"that we had something striking develop."},"176":{"dur":5,"text":"I was treating a 52-year-old gentleman\nwho, in addition to his heart disease,"},"184":{"dur":3,"text":"had a partially blocked artery\nin his right thigh."},"188":{"dur":2,"text":"And he told me about the fact"},"191":{"dur":5,"text":"that when he was crossing the skyway\nto my office, he had to stop five times"},"196":{"dur":2,"text":"because of pain in this calf,\nbecause of this blocked artery."},"200":{"dur":3,"text":"So I had him go to the vascular lab\nand we got his pulse volume."},"204":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I forgot all about his leg,\nso focused on his heart."},"207":{"dur":2,"text":"Eight months later, he said,\n\"Dr. Esselstyn do you recall"},"209":{"dur":1,"text":"when I first started seeing you,"},"211":{"dur":4,"text":"I had to stop five times crossing\nthe skyway here to your office?"},"216":{"dur":4,"text":"This last month, it got to be four times,\nthen it was three, two, one,\"."},"221":{"dur":4,"text":"He said, \"I don't stop anymore,\nthe pain is gone\"."},"225":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Don, back you go to the vascular lab.\""},"228":{"dur":3,"text":"I think if you look here, you can see\nthe difference in pulse volume"},"232":{"dur":4,"text":"when I first saw him,\nand here we were eight months later,"},"236":{"dur":2,"text":"it was now almost two times greater."},"239":{"dur":2,"text":"So the thing that was\nso exciting about this was,"},"243":{"dur":3,"text":"in science we had demonstrated\nwhat we call \"proof of concept.\""},"248":{"dur":5,"text":"Not only that, but this occurred one year\nbefore the invention of the statin drugs."},"255":{"dur":3,"text":"So this was so powerful, because\nit showed us that indeed with nutrition,"},"259":{"dur":3,"text":"we can actually not only halt\nthis disease, but we could reverse it."},"263":{"dur":4,"text":"And not shortly thereafter, what occurred,\nwe saw this now in the heart."},"268":{"dur":4,"text":"This is a 54-year-oold security guard\nwhere our angiography core laboratory"},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"described this as a 30% improvement."},"277":{"dur":5,"text":"But what really got our attention\nwas a fellow surgeon at the clinic"},"282":{"dur":5,"text":"who, at age 44 in 1996,\nbegan to get chest pain."},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"He did not have hypertension,\nhe did not have diabetes,"},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"he did not have a strong family history,\nhe was not overweight"},"295":{"dur":4,"text":"and cardiology worked him up\nin October of 1996, could find nothing."},"301":{"dur":4,"text":"Three weeks later, he was finishing\nhis surgical schedule."},"306":{"dur":1,"text":"Sat down to write\npost-operative orders."},"308":{"dur":6,"text":"Splitting headache, immediately followed\nby this crushing elephant in his chest,"},"314":{"dur":1,"text":"pain in his shoulder down his arm."},"316":{"dur":1,"text":"Joe was having a heart attack."},"318":{"dur":3,"text":"Whipped down to the cath lab,\nstart the catheterization, cardiac arrest,"},"322":{"dur":3,"text":"resuscitate, and finish\nthe catheterization."},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"And then he was sent up to the floors"},"329":{"dur":3,"text":"and discharged three days later,\nbut very depressed."},"332":{"dur":0,"text":"Why?"},"333":{"dur":3,"text":"Because what they identified was that"},"336":{"dur":4,"text":"his left anterior descending coronary\nartery, in the front of the heart,"},"340":{"dur":3,"text":"the entire lower third\nwas moth-eaten and diseased,"},"344":{"dur":5,"text":"over too long a segment to have stents,\ntoo far down the artery to have a bypass."},"350":{"dur":1,"text":"So he was very depressed about this,"},"352":{"dur":3,"text":"so my wife Anne and I had him out\nto the house with his wife for supper,"},"356":{"dur":1,"text":"two weeks after his heart attack."},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Joe you've been eating\nthis typical Western diet."},"363":{"dur":1,"text":"You've got the typical Western

else.\""},"375":{"dur":5,"text":"He became the absolute personification\nof commitment to plant-based nutrition."},"382":{"dur":6,"text":"And over the next thirty months\nhe then had another angiogram."},"389":{"dur":4,"text":"You know, up in the surgical suites,\nour offices are three doors apart."},"394":{"dur":5,"text":"And at noontime of the day\nthat I knew earlier that morning"},"400":{"dur":1,"text":"he had his follow-up angiogram,"},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"I found myself letting myself\ninto his office."},"405":{"dur":1,"text":"There he was sitting behind his

around his desk, put his arms\naround me, \"I think we're doing okay.\""},"421":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Well, any chance I could see\nthe follow-up angiogram?\""},"425":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Yeah!\""},"427":{"dur":5,"text":"It was really quite striking and exciting\nto see what actually can happen;"},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"when you give the body\nevery opportunity it can."},"437":{"dur":1,"text":"The healing capacity is incredible."},"440":{"dur":3,"text":"So now let's talk a little bit\nabout how do you injure the artery"},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"in the first place,\nwhat seems to be going wrong."},"447":{"dur":3,"text":"Now on the right, there is\na seriously diseased artery."},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"You're probably saying,\n\"That's going to have a heart attack.\""},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"No, that only causes\nabout 10% of heart attacks,"},"456":{"dur":3,"text":"but it certainly will cause chest pain\nand shortness of breath."},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"What I really want you\nto notice is on the left,"},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"and here, on the inside of this artery,"},"465":{"dur":7,"text":"there's a very, very, tiny, little dark\nsingle layer of cell \"magic carpet\","},"472":{"dur":3,"text":"that all experts would agree is where\nthe inception of this disease occurs."},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"This magic carpet is called\nthe endothelium."},"479":{"dur":4,"text":"And the endothelium has an absolutely\nmagic molecule that it produces."},"484":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a gas, nitric oxide."},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"Nitric oxide has a number\nof wonderful functions."},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"Nitric oxide keeps\nour blood flowing smoothly"},"493":{"dur":1,"text":"like Teflon, rather than velcro."},"495":{"dur":3,"text":"Two, nitric oxide is the strongest\nvasodilator in the body."},"500":{"dur":4,"text":"When you climb stairs,\nthe arteries to your heart dilate,"},"504":{"dur":1,"text":"the arteries to your legs dilate."},"507":{"dur":3,"text":"Nitric oxide inhibits inflammation\nfrom the wall of the artery,"},"510":{"dur":3,"text":"protect you from getting hypertension,\nand most importantly"},"515":{"dur":2,"text":"nitric oxide, in plentiful amounts,"},"518":{"dur":3,"text":"will protect you from ever\ndeveloping blockages or plaque."},"523":{"dur":3,"text":"Alright, how do those\n90% of heart attacks occur?"},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"You will see here the artery is divided."},"531":{"dur":3,"text":"And what you're looking at\nin the first serial on the left,"},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"is that when you start\neating that cheeseburger,"},"538":{"dur":3,"text":"the pizza, the milkshake,\nyour blood flow gets sticky."},"542":{"dur":2,"text":"And certain elements\nlike your endothelial cells get sticky,"},"545":{"dur":4,"text":"your LDL cholesterol gets sticky,\nand then the LDL bad cholesterol"},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"migrates into the sub endothelial space,"},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"where it sets up this absolute\ncauldron of inflammation."},"558":{"dur":4,"text":"And that cauldron of inflammation\nbegins making inflammatory enzymes"},"564":{"dur":4,"text":"that gradually begin to thin out\nthis delicate cap over the plaque."},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"It gets thinner and thinner\nuntil it's as thin as a cobweb,"},"573":{"dur":5,"text":"and then the sheer force of blood going\nover that thinned out plaque ruptures,"},"579":{"dur":3,"text":"and now we have spillage\nof plaque content into the flowing blood,"},"583":{"dur":3,"text":"which activates our platelets,\nour clotting factor."},"588":{"dur":3,"text":"Now we are at the beginning\nof a clot, a thrombosis,"},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"which is in and of itself,\nself-propagating."},"596":{"dur":3,"text":"So in a matter of minutes, now we have\nan artery that is totally blocked,"},"600":{"dur":5,"text":"and all the downstream heart muscle\nhas been deprived of oxygen and nutrients"},"606":{"dur":1,"text":"and starts to die."},"607":{"dur":1,"text":"That's the heart attack."},"610":{"dur":4,"text":"But there is something absolutely\nmagically exciting about this series,"},"614":{"dur":4,"text":"because if I can convince you\nthat all you have to do"},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"is change your nutrition,"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"so your internal biochemistry is such"},"625":{"dur":4,"text":"that you will not injure or thin out\nthe cap over your plaque,"},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"you will actually diminish your plaque,"},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"and you will strengthen\nthe cap over the plaque."},"637":{"dur":3,"text":"Alright, how do we do this?"},"641":{"dur":4,"text":"It's very easy, we avoid the foods\nthat injure the endothelium."},"646":{"dur":1,"text":"What are they?"},"648":{"dur":4,"text":"Even pure virgin olive oil,\ncorn oil, soybean oil,"},"652":{"dur":4,"text":"safflower oil, sunflower oil,\ncoconut oil, palm oil,

breath."},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"(Applause)"},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"But remember, no oil!"},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"(Laughter)"},"725":{"dur":1,"text":"Now conventional cardiology,"},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"with all those procedures\nand all that expense,"},"729":{"dur":4,"text":"is high mortality, high morbidity,\nand sadly it does not cure the disease,"},"733":{"dur":1,"text":"and the expense is unsustainable."},"736":{"dur":3,"text":"However, when you're treating causality\nwith plant-based nutrition,"},"739":{"dur":3,"text":"no mortality

is the average\nof about three independent"},"803":{"dur":2,"text":"cohorts cardiology studies\nthat are quite well known."},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"And the recurrent cardiac events,\nafter four years,"},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"run about 20% on average."},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"Our own, which is called\n\"Treating The Cause,\""},"814":{"dur":3,"text":"is a half of one %, that means\nroughly a 40 fold difference."},"819":{"dur":5,"text":"So in summary,\nit is so exciting what happens"},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"when you treat the causation of disease."},"829":{"dur":3,"text":"Because it is not
