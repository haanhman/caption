little break there,"},"24":{"dur":1,"text":"and we saw the package,\nyou were telling me about"},"26":{"dur":1,"text":"how you got started in this,"},"27":{"dur":1,"text":"and this is the sort of thing\nin a small town started up,"},"29":{"dur":1,"text":"just over morning\ncoffee, I guess."},"30":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, that's actually true."},"32":{"dur":2,"text":"Just a group of guys having\ncoffee in the morning"},"35":{"dur":1,"text":"like guys do,"},"36":{"dur":1,"text":"and just sittin' around\nthe table talking,"},"38":{"dur":2,"text":"and literally they\ncame up with the idea,"},"41":{"dur":2,"text":"you know what, we should\nhave a brewery in town."},"43":{"dur":2,"text":"And so they started\ntalking about it,"},"46":{"dur":1,"text":"what it would take to do it,"},"47":{"dur":2,"text":"and they started\ntalking to some people,"},"50":{"dur":1,"text":"and the more people talked,"},"51":{"dur":3,"text":"the more it seemed like\nit could be a real thing."},"55":{"dur":2,"text":"And they were lucky enough\nto hook up with some people"},"57":{"dur":2,"text":"that kinda knew what\nwould be involved"},"59":{"dur":3,"text":"and how to do it, and\nwe hooked up with the,"},"63":{"dur":2,"text":"we hired a consultant\nactually out of Wisconsin"},"65":{"dur":1,"text":"to help us out."},"67":{"dur":3,"text":"And eventually hooked up\nwith a talented young brewer"},"70":{"dur":1,"text":"by the name of Luke Rensink,"},"72":{"dur":1,"text":"and that was a\nreal breakthrough."},"73":{"dur":2,"text":"And it became a real\ncommunity effort,"},"75":{"dur":2,"text":"and here we are a\nfew years later,"},"78":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's a real thing."},"79":{"dur":2,"text":"- So five years, and\nTake 16, you're brewing,"},"82":{"dur":1,"text":"and you're also doing\nsome events, right,"},"84":{"dur":1,"text":"to kind of bring the\npublic in once in a while?"},"85":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yeah, we're for the most\npart a production brewery."},"88":{"dur":2,"text":"So once a week on\nThursday evenings,"},"90":{"dur":1,"text":"we do growler fills,\nbut otherwise,"},"91":{"dur":1,"text":"we're pretty much a\nproduction brewery."},"93":{"dur":2,"text":"In the summer, we do\ndo special events,"},"96":{"dur":1,"text":"block parties, we call 'em,"},"97":{"dur":2,"text":"and about every other

hundred\nmiles plus north of Luverne,"},"125":{"dur":2,"text":"you get to New London,\nand you get together"},"127":{"dur":2,"text":"with some friends\nand thought, hey,"},"129":{"dur":1,"text":"let's have a brew pub."},"131":{"dur":1,"text":"But it took a while to\nget there, didn't it?"},"133":{"dur":1,"text":"- It did."},"134":{"dur":1,"text":"I remember having\nour first meeting,"},"136":{"dur":4,"text":"it was January 2014, and we\nopened April 16th of 2015."},"142":{"dur":3,"text":"So, about, well, 18, 16 months\nor so to get off the

brewing,"},"151":{"dur":1,"text":"you're a brew pub, right?"},"153":{"dur":1,"text":"- That's right, yeah."},"154":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're, we would consider it\nto be a destination brewery."},"156":{"dur":1,"text":"We don't do any distribution."},"158":{"dur":2,"text":"The only place you can find\nour beer is in our tap room."},"160":{"dur":1,"text":"The only place you can drink\nour beer is in our tap room."},"162":{"dur":1,"text":"Or you can buy,\npurchase a growler"},"164":{"dur":1,"text":"and bring it home\nas well, but no,"},"165":{"dur":3,"text":"our focus is solely on\nbringing people to our place."},"169":{"dur":3,"text":"- But whether it's a brewery,\nor whether it's a brew pub,"},"172":{"dur":1,"text":"obviously the trend is here"},"174":{"dur":1,"text":"that there's some\nlocal interest in this,"},"175":{"dur":1,"text":"and so the question is why."},"177":{"dur":2,"text":"Why has this really\ncaught on nationally,"},"180":{"dur":1,"text":"or for that matter,"},"181":{"dur":2,"text":"in western Minnesota in\nthe last few years, Kirk?"},"184":{"dur":3,"text":"- Well, I think first of\nall it's an experience,"},"187":{"dur":2,"text":"whether it's going\nto Kelly's place"},"189":{"dur":2,"text":"or drinking our beer and\ncoming to our block parties,"},"192":{"dur":2,"text":"you're

it."},"216":{"dur":4,"text":"Local ingredients are\nspectacular if you can get them."},"220":{"dur":1,"text":"All of that fits together."},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's basically,\nit's better product"},"224":{"dur":3,"text":"than what you can buy from\na mass produced brewery."},"227":{"dur":2,"text":"- So certainly there's\na public appeal to this,"},"230":{"dur":1,"text":"in that people are\ninterested in it,"},"231":{"dur":2,"text":"but I expect one of the\nchallenges is actually getting"},"233":{"dur":3,"text":"something like this from\nthe idea stage to a business"},"237":{"dur":2,"text":"'cause there's gotta be a lot\nof capital involved, right?"},"239":{"dur":3,"text":"- Absolutely, yeah, the\nidea is the easy part."},"243":{"dur":2,"text":"The execution is the hard part,"},"246":{"dur":2,"text":"and there are many\nchallenges that come with it."},"248":{"dur":4,"text":"First of all, getting the\ncapital, and whatever source"},"253":{"dur":1,"text":"that's gonna be."},"254":{"dur":2,"text":"In our case, we have\nover 80 local investors,"},"257":{"dur":2,"text":"and a lot of them are\nvery small investors,"},"260":{"dur":2,"text":"so that's a very time\nconsuming process"},"262":{"dur":1,"text":"to raise that capital."},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"And then you run into\nall kinds of issues"},"268":{"dur":1,"text":"like licensing."},"271":{"dur":2,"text":"In Minnesota, you have to have\nyour plumbing plan approved."},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"You run into local

part of\nany construction process"},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"at a brewery, and generally\nthere's nobody in town"},"288":{"dur":1,"text":"that's ever done one,"},"289":{"dur":2,"text":"so they're learning\nas you're learning,"},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"and you're doing it\ntogether for the first time,"},"294":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's a challenge\nfor everybody."},"296":{"dur":1,"text":"- And I suppose in\nyour case, Kelly,"},"297":{"dur":1,"text":"you had no only that side of it,"},"299":{"dur":2,"text":"but also the service\nside on top of it"},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"with hours and getting\nthe regular traffic,"},"303":{"dur":1,"text":"so that's another\nlayer of complexity."},"305":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, it can be."},"307":{"dur":3,"text":"Particularly when you're,\nI think, in rural areas"},"310":{"dur":1,"text":"trying to drive in traffic\nthat maybe isn't use to"},"312":{"dur":1,"text":"those kinds of beer,"},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"trying it for the first time,"},"315":{"dur":1,"text":"having this type of experience,"},"316":{"dur":1,"text":"there's a lot of training\nthat goes into our staff"},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"to give them an experience\nof describing the beer,"},"320":{"dur":1,"text":"so actually trying to find staff"},"322":{"dur":1,"text":"that's experienced with\nbeer and the flavors"},"324":{"dur":2,"text":"and the different kinds\ncan be a unique challenge,"},"326":{"dur":2,"text":"but also pretty fun to do\nsome of those trainings"},"328":{"dur":2,"text":"and teach people about it\n'cause they're the ones"},"331":{"dur":1,"text":"that have to interact\nwith the customers"},"332":{"dur":1,"text":"and explain what it\nis they're drinking,"},"334":{"dur":1,"text":"why it's different\nthan maybe something,"},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"a regular kind of macro\nbeer they might be drinking,"},"337":{"dur":2,"text":"so that is kind of an\ninteresting wrinkle"},"339":{"dur":1,"text":"on the service side."},"341":{"dur":1,"text":"- Well, and I suppose also,\ntoo, that this gets, will be"},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"like the price points\nyou find in coffee"},"345":{"dur":3,"text":"where people may be used to\ndiner coffee at a certain price"},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"versus going to a coffee shop\nand having a different price,"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"so are there some of\nthose consumer perceptions"},"353":{"dur":1,"text":"that you have to\novercome as well?"},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yeah, there is, we definitely\nhear it once in a while"},"357":{"dur":2,"text":"from customers that are\nnot used to the prices"},"360":{"dur":1,"text":"that we have to\ncharge on our beer,"},"361":{"dur":1,"text":"we're putting a lot\nof ingredients in,"},"363":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's all about economies\nof scale, too, you know."},"365":{"dur":2,"text":"Our particular brewery is\ntwo and a half barrels,"},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"so we're producing\nessentially 78 gallon batches."},"370":{"dur":1,"text":"This is small,\nit's really small."},"372":{"dur":3,"text":"So our economy of scale is going\nto be quite a bit different"},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"than somebody that's producing\nmany hundreds of gallons"},"378":{"dur":2,"text":"of beer, or even thousands of\ngallons of beer at one batch."},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"And so our price points\nare a little bit different,"},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"but what we try to\nexplain is you're getting"},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"a lot more bang for\nyour buck, we feel,"},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"at those price points."},"389":{"dur":1,"text":"- And what about\nthe scale for you"},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"because obviously,\nKirk, you're not selling"},"393":{"dur":1,"text":"necessarily on site\nexcept in special events,"},"395":{"dur":1,"text":"so what about price points\nand marketing challenges"},"397":{"dur":1,"text":"for your operation?"},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yeah, we're a little\nlarger than what Kelly's got."},"401":{"dur":3,"text":"We have a 15 barrel brewhouse,\nand we have multiple"},"405":{"dur":1,"text":"30 barrel fermenters,"},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"so we are production size,"},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"and we're gonna crank out\nabout 2,000 barrels this year,"},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"which is still very, very\nsmall, but it's larger"},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"than your average brew pub,"},"417":{"dur":3,"text":"so that's things that we\nare working on right now,"},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"Kelly mentioned\nproduction costs,"},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"and that's one way to make\nsure you're successful is"},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"to keep your inputs down."},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"And there are things you can\ndo like buying grain in bulk,"},"433":{"dur":3,"text":"and we have hops on\na commodity contract"},"436":{"dur":2,"text":"and things like that,\nso the more you produce,"},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"the more you can\ndo things like that"},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"and bring your costs down."},"442":{"dur":1,"text":"- So since you've\nboth been doing this"},"443":{"dur":1,"text":"for at least a little while now,"},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm sure that if someone's\nwatching this and thinking,"},"446":{"dur":1,"text":"oh, this sounds really cool,"},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"I bet they'd wanna know\nwhat are the lessons"},"450":{"dur":1,"text":"'cause you both had to learn\nsome hard lessons, I'm sure,"},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"so what are some of the\nlessons you have learned"},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"that you wish you would've\nknow when you started this?"},"456":{"dur":4,"text":"- Well, one of the things is\nto trust what you believe in."},"461":{"dur":3,"text":"And we've worked with\nsome outside people"},"464":{"dur":3,"text":"that give us advice,\nand what we've found is"},"467":{"dur":1,"text":"you know your situation best,"},"469":{"dur":3,"text":"and do your homework,\nand find out all you can"},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"about the situation,\nbut in the end,"},"476":{"dur":1,"text":"you've gotta trust\nyour own instincts"},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"because it's your operation,\nand it's gonna be yours"},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"going forward, and nobody\nelse cares about it"},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"as much as you do and\nknows as much as you do,"},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"so trust what you believe\nin, and go with that."},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"- Trust and stay with it and\na lotta hard work, I'm sure."},"491":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Kirk] Yes, absolutely."},"492":{"dur":1,"text":"- Kelly?"},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yeah, I think, I'm\nsmiling just thinking back"},"496":{"dur":1,"text":"to when we opened."},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"I would say one big\nlesson that we learned was"},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"being prepared for the\ntraffic you're gonna get."},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"We opened, and we\nthought we would have"},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"enough product to\nsupply the demand,"},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"and it was touch and go\nthere for a little while"},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"where we were barely\nkeeping up, you know."},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"We tried to keep seven\ndifferent beers on tap"},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"at all times, and there was\none point in the summer,"},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"walking in, I think, we\nmaybe had two or three."},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"And we're sittin' there\nbrewing as fast as we can"},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"in the back, but\nit's only so quickly"},"523":{"dur":1,"text":"you can turn this stuff around."},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I think, when you\nfirst open, recognizing that"},"527":{"dur":3,"text":"that initial impression,\nthat first impression"},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"that people have coming in to\nyour place has a big impact"},"533":{"dur":1,"text":"and making sure you're\nprepared for that,"},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"and you're prepared to deliver,\nis kind of a lesson learned"},"538":{"dur":1,"text":"on our end, I know."},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"- So we've got the\nidea of staying with,"},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"stay true to your idea, be\nprepared, have the capital,"},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"okay so, if someone says,\nokay, what's the first step"},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"in starting a\nbusiness like this,"},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"what would the first step be?"},"552":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean if you were to\ngive advice to someone"},"554":{"dur":1,"text":"who wants to get\ninto the business?"},"556":{"dur":1,"text":"- Well I think the first\nthing is you've gotta have"},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"a product that people\nwant to consume,"},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"so in our case, we hooked\nup with a young brewer,"},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"and he had a little track\nrecord of actually brewing beer"},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"that was distributed, so\nwe felt good about that,"},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"and then while we\nwere raising capital,"},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"we also did tastings."},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"So we did two years of tastings\nbefore we sold anything,"},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"so we knew right off the bat"},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"which beers we\nwanted to put out."},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"We came out with four\nbeers right off the bat"},"584":{"dur":1,"text":"at the same time."},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"- Were the results of the\ntaste tests surprising?"},"587":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean did people\nlike what you thought"},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"they were going to like?"},"590":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, you know,\nthe surprising part,"},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"it sounds like I'm bragging,"},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"the surprising part was\nwe didn't have a beer"},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"that people said, I\nreally don't like this."},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"So different people\nlike different styles,"},"602":{"dur":1,"text":"so everybody had their favorite,"},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"but it was pretty universal"},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"that people really,\nreally just liked it,"},"608":{"dur":1,"text":"and we felt really\ngood about that."},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"And we felt good about who\nwe were having brew the beer,"},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"and I think that's the\nmost important part."},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"- Kelly?"},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"- Well, I think Kirk\nabsolutely nails it,"},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"it's making sure the\nproduct you're producing is"},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"worthy enough to\nhave demand, right,"},"623":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that's right on,"},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"and doing that work\nand making sure"},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"that you're producing something\nthat's going to be bought."},"628":{"dur":3,"text":"Past that, I think\nalso it's sitting down"},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"and looking at your market\nand trying to figure out,"},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"there's a big difference\nbetween the scale at which"},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"you're producing and\nthe demand for that,"},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"and when you start looking\nat brewing systems,"},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"they have these\nvarious levels of,"},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"two and a half barrel\nsystem, five barrel,"},"647":{"dur":1,"text":"and all of a sudden\nyou're up to 10, 20,"},"648":{"dur":1,"text":"and you don't wanna go too big,"},"650":{"dur":1,"text":"you don't wanna go too small,"},"651":{"dur":1,"text":"and so really trying to\nnail down that number"},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"where you think you can\nproduce and get demand,"},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"you're producing enough\nbut not too much,"},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"that I think is\nreally important."},"660":{"dur":1,"text":"So checking out your numbers,"},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"looking at your area businesses,"},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"how much traffic could\nyou honestly expect,"},"666":{"dur":1,"text":"and being realistic about it,"},"667":{"dur":3,"text":"both for big and small,\nand then trying to match"},"670":{"dur":3,"text":"the brewing system with\nthat demand is important."},"674":{"dur":4,"text":"- So after five years and a\nfew months in this business,"},"678":{"dur":1,"text":"you both have a sense\neither from studying"},"680":{"dur":1,"text":"or working in it,\nwhat it's like,"},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"what's the next\nbig wave in this?"},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"Are we going to see\na lot more of these"},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"across rural
