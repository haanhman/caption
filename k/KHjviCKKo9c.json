a\nlittle bit more later."},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"And eventually we're going to move"},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"out to the moon with\nthe Orion capsule."},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"Then we're going to use

of\na different way that I like."},"685":{"dur":3,"text":"So basically the Earth Reliant\nsystem here, that's ISS, right,"},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"these missions last\nfrom six to 12 months."},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"Actually three men\nlaunched this morning"},"693":{"dur":1,"text":"to the International Space Station."},"694":{"dur":3,"text":"So we had one NASA astronaut and\ntwo

two to three years."},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"So we need to learn how humans\ncan survive in space that long,"},"739":{"dur":3,"text":"how we can land on and launch\noff of the Martian

these processes\nand send back lessons learned"},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"to the scientist here on\nEarth that study them."},"792":{"dur":1,"text":"So they're observing

crucial\nin preparing us to operate"},"832":{"dur":3,"text":"in this Mars system and\nthe journey to Mars."},"836":{"dur":1,"text":"But the rest of the talk\nI'm going to the focus"},"837":{"dur":2,"text":"on actually conducting\nscience on other planets,"},"839":{"dur":1,"text":"planetary surface exploration."},"841":{"dur":2,"text":"So the question I think about\nevery

long"},"1356":{"dur":1,"text":"and fits into that EVA timeline."},"1358":{"dur":1,"text":"We have crew training, too."},"1360":{"dur":2,"text":"A real benefit of this was bringing\nthese astronauts

that's jointly\nfunded through the human exploration"},"1791":{"dur":2,"text":"and the science communities, because\nthey recognize that there's a lot"},"1794":{"dur":3,"text":"of overplay here and we

December 1974 flow."},"1891":{"dur":1,"text":"So we have a crew of three."},"1892":{"dur":3,"text":"We had two geologists and one\nastronaut on our crew that year."},"1896":{"dur":1,"text":"We had a

that was -- that was a\nreally interesting aspect"},"1943":{"dur":1,"text":"of the RIS4E project."},"1944":{"dur":1,"text":"So here's our field site."},"1946":{"dur":1,"text":"This is the big Island of Hawaii."},"1948":{"dur":1,"text":"The five volcanos that make"},"1949":{"dur":2,"text":"up the big island are\nhighlighted here in yellow."},"1951":{"dur":2,"text":"Our field site is right down

here toward the\nocean, which is down here."},"1967":{"dur":2,"text":"One of the interesting\nthings about this site is"},"1969":{"dur":3,"text":"that if you see this sort of\nhazy, white plume right here,"},"1973":{"dur":1,"text":"that's actually the active plume"},"1974":{"dur":2,"text":"from the Kilauea called\n[inaudible] on the big island."},"1976":{"dur":1,"text":"So the plume is floating, you\nknow, right above your head"},"1978":{"dur":3,"text":"and when it rains it sort of pushes\nthat plume down on top of the flow."},"1981":{"dur":2,"text":"So it creates some really\ninteresting alteration products"},"1984":{"dur":1,"text":"that we were looking\nat with the RIS4E team"},"1986":{"dur":2,"text":"and with field [inaudible]\ninstruments."},"1988":{"dur":4,"text":"So here's a view from the ground\non the December 1974 flow."},"1993":{"dur":3,"text":"You're standing looking up\nslope toward the caldera,"},"1996":{"dur":2,"text":"so that sort of reddish-brownish\nsmoke is actually"},"1998":{"dur":2,"text":"that plume coming up\nout of the caldera."},"2001":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is what the\nflow looks like."},"2002":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's a great analog environment."},"2004":{"dur":2,"text":"It's actually in the Kahu Desert."},"2007":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a desert environment that has\nbrief damp periods when it rains."},"2010":{"dur":1,"text":"There's alteration on that flow."},"2012":{"dur":4,"text":"You can kind of see sort of whiter\nproducts on this darker flow,"},"2016":{"dur":1,"text":"those are actually\nalteration products that result"},"2018":{"dur":3,"text":"when this plume interacts\nwith the surface of the flow."},"2021":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's a -- and it's a great\nanalog for other planetary surfaces"},"2024":{"dur":4,"text":"because you have these traditional\nbasaltic lava flows that intersperse"},"2028":{"dur":1,"text":"with basaltic ash,\nbasaltic sediment,"},"2030":{"dur":4,"text":"that's reworked lava flows, sort of\nscattered in and amongst each other."},"2034":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's got this really\nlow slope flow morphology,"},"2038":{"dur":3,"text":"which is pretty similar to a\nlot of areas we see on Mars."},"2042":{"dur":1,"text":"So here are the instruments\nwe had out with us."},"2044":{"dur":1,"text":"I won't dwell on them."},"2045":{"dur":2,"text":"We had sort of a broad\nfield of view instruments."},"2048":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you, you can imagine\nyou're an astronaut

going"},"2056":{"dur":2,"text":"to initiate from inside the rover."},"2058":{"dur":2,"text":"And that includes multispectral\nimaging, which tells us"},"2061":{"dur":1,"text":"about the composition of the\nsurface of the [inaudible]."},"2063":{"dur":2,"text":"You have LIDAR, which is\nan instrument designed"},"2066":{"dur":2,"text":"to map surface texture."},"2068":{"dur":1,"text":"Then we had ground\npenetrating radar,"},"2070":{"dur":2,"text":"which probes the subsurface\nof the lava flows."},"2073":{"dur":2,"text":"We had this handheld spectrometer,\nthat I mentioned earlier,"},"2075":{"dur":1,"text":"as well as a different\ntype of spectrometer"},"2077":{"dur":2,"text":"that gives you mineralogy\nor other information"},"2080":{"dur":2,"text":"about what builds the rock,\nwhat the rock is made out of."},"2082":{"dur":3,"text":"And then we actually had a kite out\nwith us to provide airborne images."},"2086":{"dur":2,"text":"That image I showed a couple\nslides ago actually was taken"},"2089":{"dur":1,"text":"from a camera mounted on a kite."},"2090":{"dur":1,"text":"And the reason we did that is"},"2092":{"dur":4,"text":"because it's really hard fly UAVs\nright now in National Parks, right."},"2096":{"dur":1,"text":"So a kite is a good way to say --"},"2098":{"dur":2,"text":"to sort of work with the park\nservice a little bit and, you know,"},"2101":{"dur":1,"text":"it's a way for both of\nus to get what we want,"},"2103":{"dur":3,"text":"and we got some really\nspectacular images with it."},"2106":{"dur":2,"text":"So I bet you thought you were\ngoing to make out of this topic"},"2108":{"dur":2,"text":"with no squiggly lines, no can do."},"2111":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm a geologist so I have to\nshow at least one squiggly line."},"2114":{"dur":1,"text":"And I won't dwell on it."},"2115":{"dur":2,"text":"The purpose is just to show the\ntypes of data that we're getting"},"2118":{"dur":2,"text":"in the field so you can\nunderstand what I'm talking"},"2120":{"dur":3,"text":"about when I'm talking about\ndata from these instruments."},"2123":{"dur":2,"text":"So we looked at things like the\nalteration coatings on the rock."},"2126":{"dur":1,"text":"What are these sort of\nwhitish coatings made"},"2128":{"dur":1,"text":"out of and do they vary at all?"},"2129":{"dur":2,"text":"Are they the same across\nthe whole flow?"},"2131":{"dur":1,"text":"If they vary, how do they vary?"},"2133":{"dur":1,"text":"How do they change?"},"2134":{"dur":3,"text":"And why? We looked at this area,\nthis -- it's called a solfatara,"},"2138":{"dur":1,"text":"a site of hydrothermal alterations."},"2140":{"dur":1,"text":"So if there's any heat\nthat's sort of left"},"2141":{"dur":4,"text":"over from this continuous volcanic\nactivity it can alter the rock"},"2146":{"dur":1,"text":"and change the composition\nand the texture."},"2148":{"dur":2,"text":"We also looked at flow\nmorphology and emplacement."},"2151":{"dur":2,"text":"I love this image taken with a kite."},"2153":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is actually, this\nlittle dot right here of sort"},"2156":{"dur":3,"text":"of lighter material, is actually the\nflow that's underneath the December"},"2159":{"dur":1,"text":"1974 flow."},"2161":{"dur":1,"text":"So it shows you how\nshallow this flow is."},"2163":{"dur":2,"text":"It actually flowed in and around\nthe preexisting topography,"},"2166":{"dur":1,"text":"and you can still see islands there."},"2167":{"dur":2,"text":"And we see this all over\nthe Martian surface as well."},"2170":{"dur":2,"text":"So these instruments are\nhelping us to understand --"},"2173":{"dur":3,"text":"these are how the -- this is how\nthese processes work on our planet"},"2177":{"dur":4,"text":"to understand how they're probably\nworking on the Martian surface."},"2181":{"dur":2,"text":"But like I said, there are\noperational considerations"},"2184":{"dur":1,"text":"of using these instruments."},"2185":{"dur":3,"text":"Going back to the Desert RATS\nexample, like I said earlier,"},"2188":{"dur":2,"text":"while increased science\nvalue is important,"},"2191":{"dur":2,"text":"what effects is actually\nusing these instruments"},"2193":{"dur":1,"text":"on EVA have on your timeline?"},"2195":{"dur":3,"text":"So the RIS4E experiment is actually\nbuilding off these desert rock"},"2198":{"dur":2,"text":"timelines understand\nhow this might work."},"2201":{"dur":3,"text":"So, again, just a quick example."},"2204":{"dur":2,"text":"Again, you just have one\nmore scientific plot to get"},"2206":{"dur":1,"text":"out of the way and\nthen we can move on."},"2207":{"dur":4,"text":"Here's a geologic map, like I\nsaid, of the Desert RATS test area."},"2211":{"dur":2,"text":"Each one of these black\ndots represents a place"},"2214":{"dur":2,"text":"where I conducted an EVA\nand picked up a sample."},"2217":{"dur":2,"text":"So I didn't take -- these aren't\nall the locations we visited"},"2219":{"dur":2,"text":"but I just wanted to sort of isolate\nthe problem to show you example"},"2222":{"dur":1,"text":"of how these instruments might work."},"2224":{"dur":3,"text":"So all these places we drove\nrover, we got out of the rover,"},"2227":{"dur":2,"text":"we picked up a rock, and put it on\nthe rover to take back to Earth."},"2229":{"dur":4,"text":"So you can see that this flow\nright here, this is a really,"},"2233":{"dur":4,"text":"really young lava flow, relatively\nyoung, and it looks really different"},"2237":{"dur":1,"text":"from everything else around it."},"2238":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a lot darker."},"2240":{"dur":1,"text":"It outcrops differently."},"2241":{"dur":2,"text":"It's bigger and forms these\nsort of like big cliff faces."},"2244":{"dur":2,"text":"It's really dark in color."},"2246":{"dur":3,"text":"So you can tell that when\nyou're a geologist astronaut"},"2249":{"dur":2,"text":"on the ground this is\ndifferent than anything else."},"2252":{"dur":3,"text":"However, the samples around that\nflow look pretty homogenous."},"2255":{"dur":2,"text":"It was kind of hard when you're\non an EVA with limited time,"},"2258":{"dur":1,"text":"and we were on the\nground for 25 minutes."},"2260":{"dur":2,"text":"There's just not a lot of time\nto stop and think and look"},"2263":{"dur":1,"text":"at the rock in front of you."},"2264":{"dur":1,"text":"If you had infinite time"},"2265":{"dur":2,"text":"in this area you're probably\nsitting in pretty good shape."},"2268":{"dur":1,"text":"But for us we just\ndidn't have a lot of time."},"2270":{"dur":3,"text":"So what do we need to maximize\nthat amount of time and tell us"},"2273":{"dur":2,"text":"about the volcanic\nhistory of this region."},"2276":{"dur":3,"text":"So the samples around\nthis younger flow, as crew"},"2279":{"dur":2,"text":"and the other crews said the same\nthing, they weren't really able"},"2281":{"dur":2,"text":"to identify any differences\nin these rocks just"},"2284":{"dur":1,"text":"in the limited time you had."},"2285":{"dur":2,"text":"And then once you got back into\nthe rover you lose your access,"},"2287":{"dur":1,"text":"you can't see the rocks\nanymore, right."},"2289":{"dur":2,"text":"So even if you saw a rock two days\nlater they are like, you know,"},"2292":{"dur":2,"text":"this could be similar to\nwhat I saw the other day,"},"2295":{"dur":2,"text":"you can't go back and look, right."},"2297":{"dur":3,"text":"So I went and I took all these\nsamples that we collected"},"2300":{"dur":1,"text":"on our traverse and ran them"},"2301":{"dur":2,"text":"through with this x-ray\nfluorescent spectrometer"},"2304":{"dur":1,"text":"that gives you chemistry."},"2305":{"dur":3,"text":"So, again, I don't need to dwell\non the plots here, but suffice it"},"2308":{"dur":2,"text":"to say that the samples\nactually cluster themselves"},"2311":{"dur":1,"text":"into three distinct groups."},"2312":{"dur":2,"text":"And when you go back and\nplot them on the map, hey,"},"2315":{"dur":1,"text":"you're able to [inaudible]\nthree distinct flows."},"2317":{"dur":3,"text":"So you have one flow that flows\nover to the west of SP flow,"},"2320":{"dur":1,"text":"which is this darker flow."},"2321":{"dur":3,"text":"And then you have a younger one\nthat comes off to the east here."},"2325":{"dur":2,"text":"And so this is something that\nwe were not able to identify"},"2327":{"dur":2,"text":"in the field just because of the\nlimited amount of time we had."},"2330":{"dur":3,"text":"But this instrument gave us the\nability to see those differences."},"2334":{"dur":2,"text":"And if we had known that\nin the field, who knows,"},"2336":{"dur":2,"text":"it might have altered what we\nwanted to do with the traverse."},"2338":{"dur":3,"text":"We might've spent more time looking\nfor more samples from this flow"},"2341":{"dur":1,"text":"because we only ended\nup getting two of them."},"2342":{"dur":3,"text":"So it might've altered\nwhat we did real-time."},"2346":{"dur":3,"text":"And the hit, the operational hit\nto that, every time I decided"},"2349":{"dur":2,"text":"to take an analysis with this\ninstrument it's a two minute hit."},"2352":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a 60 second analysis time plus\nwhatever documentation, pictures,"},"2356":{"dur":2,"text":"I need to do to make sure I\nremember where this data came from."},"2358":{"dur":3,"text":"So this just helps you understand,\nyou know, every time you decide"},"2362":{"dur":2,"text":"to use an instrument, and this is\nactually one of the lower cost hits"},"2365":{"dur":1,"text":"of an instrument that we use."},"2366":{"dur":2,"text":"Some of these instruments can\ntake an hour and a half to deploy."},"2368":{"dur":3,"text":"So you need to understand how much\nscience value you get from one"},"2372":{"dur":2,"text":"of these instruments based\non the hit to your timeline."},"2374":{"dur":1,"text":"And two minutes, you're\nsitting there being like,"},"2376":{"dur":1,"text":"she's crazy, two minutes is nothing."},"2378":{"dur":2,"text":"When you're in an EVA suit\nand you have, for example,"},"2380":{"dur":3,"text":"eight hours to explore this\nbig area, two minutes can --"},"2384":{"dur":1,"text":"they really start to add up."},"2385":{"dur":1,"text":"And the other operational\nconsideration is"},"2387":{"dur":2,"text":"that if you're an astronaut\nin a pressurized spacesuit"},"2389":{"dur":2,"text":"and you're trying to hold a\nspectrometer up to a rock,"},"2392":{"dur":2,"text":"that has to maintain constant\ncontact with the service"},"2394":{"dur":2,"text":"of the rock, and you're tired,\nyou also want to look around."},"2396":{"dur":1,"text":"You're on Mars."},"2398":{"dur":1,"text":"You want to see what's around."},"2399":{"dur":1,"text":"And you're moving your body\nwhen you're doing this."},"2401":{"dur":3,"text":"So 60 seconds is a long time to\n-- for me to go up to an astronaut"},"2404":{"dur":2,"text":"and say, can you just\nhold still for 60 seconds."},"2407":{"dur":1,"text":"So there's a lot at play here."},"2409":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a lot operationally at\nplay that we need to understand."},"2411":{"dur":4,"text":"So just to sort of sum up\nthe instrument section."},"2416":{"dur":3,"text":"We know that field portable\ninstruments are highly beneficial"},"2419":{"dur":2,"text":"in both sample high grading,\nfiguring out what samples you want"},"2421":{"dur":3,"text":"to bring back to Earth, and\ngaining this real-time insight."},"2425":{"dur":2,"text":"Selecting an instrument\nsuite is

whatever destination\nwe end up going to,"},"2445":{"dur":3,"text":"you want to tailor your instrument\nsuite specifically toward"},"2448":{"dur":1,"text":"that landing site area."},"2450":{"dur":1,"text":"And we're still working"},"2451":{"dur":2,"text":"to investigate how we'll effectively\nintegrate these instruments"},"2454":{"dur":2,"text":"into future EVA's, but we\nneed to continue to test"},"2456":{"dur":2,"text":"in these relevant analog\nenvironments."},"2459":{"dur":1,"text":"What's also important\nto continue to develop,"},"2461":{"dur":2,"text":"and this is the last\nshort little section,"},"2463":{"dur":2,"text":"is we need to train the\npeople who are going"},"2465":{"dur":1,"text":"to be holding these\nin their hands, right."},"2467":{"dur":2,"text":"This is not the answer\nto science, right."},"2469":{"dur":1,"text":"You're not ever going to say --"},"2470":{"dur":1,"text":"you're not ever going to have\nan instrument that flashes green"},"2472":{"dur":2,"text":"for yes, you should return a sample,\nor red for no, you shouldn't."},"2475":{"dur":2,"text":"You need to have a crew that\nunderstands how to use them,"},"2478":{"dur":3,"text":"understands the data, and geology."},"2481":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're working on\ntraining the astronauts"},"2483":{"dur":2,"text":"who will eventually be flying\nsome of these missions,"},"2485":{"dur":2,"text":"and that started back\nin the Apollo days."},"2488":{"dur":2,"text":"We say that the Apollo\nastronauts had the

the private companies\naren't really focusing on Mars"},"2878":{"dur":1,"text":"for mining, they're\nfocusing on asteroids."},"2879":{"dur":2,"text":"So they're looking at, you\nknow, trace elements

to sort of like\nstart to manufacture fuel"},"2895":{"dur":2,"text":"to launch back off the\nsurface and go back to Earth."},"2897":{"dur":3,"text":"So from a mining standpoint Mars\nisn't as popular

stringent"},"2912":{"dur":2,"text":"about what's even going to\nbe possible in that respect."},"2914":{"dur":3,"text":"So with Mars specifically,\nwe're focused on
