world,"},"509":{"dur":1,"text":"although actually I do have some reservations"},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"about calling that a world."},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"But let's say there's a

this,"},"552":{"dur":1,"text":"and then there's a kind of embedded imagining,"},"553":{"dur":1,"text":"which incorporates only this,"},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"and refers to a different time and place,"},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"the time of The Lady of Shallot."},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"And fictions can do that quite a lot, too."},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, now, sometimes fictions ask us"},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"to have certain mental images,"},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"as I'm sure you're aware."},"574":{"dur":4,"text":"And here is a famous passage from Charlotte

complete room"},"637":{"dur":3,"text":"but bits of room coming into your mind,"},"640":{"dur":2,"text":"bits of furniture that corresponds with the description"},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"that you're being given there."},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"However, not all fiction asks you"},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"to have mental images."},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"And here's a passage where I

distinction"},"709":{"dur":4,"text":"between two kinds of imagining called for by fiction."},"713":{"dur":3,"text":"The first one, I'm going to call imagining that."},"717":{"dur":3,"text":"And now, this takes the grammatical form,"},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"imagining that some state of affairs is the case,"},"725":{"dur":3,"text":"or imagining that such and such is the case,"},"729":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's propositional."},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"What I mean by that is, as it says there,"},"734":{"dur":1,"text":"it takes proposition as its object."},"736":{"dur":3,"text":"And what I mean by proposition is, roughly,"},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"the content of a declarative sentence,"},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"something that has a subject and

attitude"},"767":{"dur":1,"text":"because it seems to be a mental relation"},"768":{"dur":2,"text":"to some proposition of a certain kind."},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, I haven't said much about what that relation is"},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"except to say that it's imagining,"},"776":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's, of course, one of the interesting questions"},"778":{"dur":4,"text":"for philosophers to explain what it is that relation is."},"782":{"dur":1,"text":"But it seems like when you imagine"},"783":{"dur":1,"text":"that something is the case,"},"785":{"dur":3,"text":"you stand in some relation to some proposition."},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'm going to assume that this is not imagistic."},"791":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, this is, of course, controversial."},"792":{"dur":3,"text":"There are philosophers who would deny,"},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"probably, almost everything I'm saying individually."},"799":{"dur":3,"text":"But I'm going to assume that proposition or imagining,"},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"imagining that is not essentially imagistic."},"805":{"dur":1,"text":"Although it may be accompanied contingently"},"806":{"dur":3,"text":"by mental imagery, it isn't imagistic."},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"There's also a kind of imagining, I'm going to assume,"},"814":{"dur":3,"text":"which, as I've said fictions can call for,"},"818":{"dur":3,"text":"that involves mental imagery essentially."},"821":{"dur":3,"text":"So this takes a different grammatical form."},"824":{"dur":1,"text":"This isn't imagining that"},"826":{"dur":1,"text":"some state of affairs is the case,"},"828":{"dur":2,"text":"this is just something like imagining an X,"},"831":{"dur":2,"text":"imagining a lion, imagining a fire,"},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"imagining a man on a unicycle."},"838":{"dur":3,"text":"So, there isn't this proposition there."},"841":{"dur":2,"text":"It's more like some kind of mental relation"},"844":{"dur":2,"text":"to a represented object."},"848":{"dur":3,"text":"Because of that, it's non-propositional, I will assume."},"852":{"dur":1,"text":"At least in its surface

imagistic."},"862":{"dur":1,"text":"So to have this kind of imagining"},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"is to have a mental image."},"867":{"dur":2,"text":"So with that distinction in

okay."},"944":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, I'm going to say that there's a sense"},"947":{"dur":3,"text":"in which you can have an image of a square circle."},"951":{"dur":1,"text":"But there's probably a more interesting sense"},"953":{"dur":1,"text":"in which you can't."},"955":{"dur":0,"text":"(some audience members laugh)"},"956":{"dur":2,"text":"Sorry, that was not meant to be"},"958":{"dur":1,"text":"any slight on anyone who said they could."},"960":{"dur":2,"text":"(audience laughs)"},"963":{"dur":1,"text":"I think there's two ways"},"965":{"dur":1,"text":"that you

here,"},"1372":{"dur":2,"text":"what is the source of this limit?"},"1374":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not because we can't have an image,"},"1377":{"dur":3,"text":"in this case, of Craig doing the right thing."},"1381":{"dur":1,"text":"We're not being asked to do that."},"1383":{"dur":4,"text":"We're being asked to imagine that it's the case."},"1387":{"dur":2,"text":"And as we saw earlier in the

fiction."},"1416":{"dur":3,"text":"Here's the first supposed explanation."},"1421":{"dur":3,"text":"And this says, you can't imagine that R is true"},"1424":{"dur":2,"text":"because R is impossible."},"1426":{"dur":2,"text":"R describes an impossible state of affairs."},"1428":{"dur":3,"text":"It's not possible that Craig did the right thing"},"1432":{"dur":3,"text":"in shooting Jack

arguably."},"1441":{"dur":1,"text":"Some people thought so."},"1443":{"dur":2,"text":"It's impossible that there could be a square circle,"},"1446":{"dur":2,"text":"so you can't imagine it."},"1449":{"dur":4,"text":"Now that looks appealing at first glance, perhaps."},"1454":{"dur":1,"text":"Philosophers have certainly thought"},"1455":{"dur":1,"text":"that there's some kind of interesting relationship"},"1457":{"dur":3,"text":"between imaginability and possibility."},"1463":{"dur":4,"text":"But one problem here, for this candidate explanation,"},"1468":{"dur":3,"text":"is that actually it doesn't seem impossible"},"1472":{"dur":3,"text":"that Craig did the right thing in this situation,"},"1475":{"dur":2,"text":"because we can actually think of a context"},"1477":{"dur":2,"text":"where it's not only possible he did the right thing,"},"1480":{"dur":3,"text":"it looks even probable he did the right thing."},"1484":{"dur":3,"text":"In other words, we could add a certain amount of context."},"1487":{"dur":3,"text":"So, say, for instance, in some kind of"},"1492":{"dur":2,"text":"very unlikely scenario, admittedly,"},"1495":{"dur":2,"text":"some evil villain had hacked into"},"1498":{"dur":2,"text":"the transport system that day,"},"1501":{"dur":3,"text":"and they had said that if traffic slows down"},"1507":{"dur":1,"text":"lower than a certain point,"},"1508":{"dur":2,"text":"all the primary schools were going to get blown up."},"1511":{"dur":1,"text":"Alright, so some kind of Speed,"},"1512":{"dur":4,"text":"if anyone's watched the film Speed from my youth,"},"1517":{"dur":1,"text":"Keanu Reeves is on a bus,"},"1518":{"dur":2,"text":"and if the bus slows down past a certain point"},"1520":{"dur":1,"text":"then it's going to blow up."},"1522":{"dur":3,"text":"And all the passengers will be killed."},"1525":{"dur":2,"text":"So say that that's true in this story,"},"1527":{"dur":1,"text":"and Craig knows this,"},"1529":{"dur":2,"text":"and even Jack and Jill knows this but they don't care,"},"1531":{"dur":2,"text":"they're callously just going to have their argument anyway,"},"1533":{"dur":3,"text":"then maybe Craig did do the right thing in shooting them."},"1537":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not sure about running over their bodies."},"1539":{"dur":2,"text":"But, (laughs) maybe I could think"},"1541":{"dur":2,"text":"of an extra bit of the story to explain"},"1544":{"dur":3,"text":"why it's actually okay to run over their bodies."},"1548":{"dur":2,"text":"In other words, it looks like,"},"1550":{"dur":3,"text":"at least here's a potential objection to this kind of worry,"},"1554":{"dur":3,"text":"so moral judgements don't get applied"},"1559":{"dur":2,"text":"to situations described very sparely."},"1561":{"dur":1,"text":"If you're a particularist, for instance,"},"1563":{"dur":1,"text":"about moral judgements,"},"1564":{"dur":1,"text":"you'll think they're going to,"},"1565":{"dur":2,"text":"or even if you're some kind of generalist,"},"1567":{"dur":1,"text":"you're going to think that moral judgements"},"1569":{"dur":3,"text":"apply to situations articulated in some detail."},"1574":{"dur":2,"text":"If we get the right detail,"},"1576":{"dur":2,"text":"suddenly it becomes explicable."},"1582":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, you might say, okay, but that's unfair"},"1584":{"dur":1,"text":"because I've added in some extra details"},"1586":{"dur":1,"text":"that weren't in the

system."},"1599":{"dur":1,"text":"Even if we restrict the content of the story"},"1601":{"dur":1,"text":"to just what we saw on the slide"},"1603":{"dur":2,"text":"when Death on a Freeway,"},"1605":{"dur":2,"text":"it's still quite a strong and demanding claim"},"1607":{"dur":1,"text":"to say that it's impossible"},"1609":{"dur":2,"text":"that this guy did the right thing."},"1612":{"dur":4,"text":"People aren't usually that confident about morality."},"1616":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're any kind of moral relativist,"},"1618":{"dur":4,"text":"then you're not going to accept that claim, I think."},"1624":{"dur":3,"text":"Just the sheer variety of moral views across the world"},"1627":{"dur":2,"text":"should give us pause, I think,"},"1629":{"dur":2,"text":"and prevent us from wanting to say"},"1632":{"dur":3,"text":"that our moral claims are necessarily true, if they're true."},"1636":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think that it may be that this kind"},"1641":{"dur":3,"text":"of explanation can work if it's taken far enough,"},"1644":{"dur":3,"text":"but I'm skeptical about whether it can."},"1647":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, here's a different candidate explanation"},"1650":{"dur":2,"text":"for our resistance to R."},"1653":{"dur":1,"text":"You resist imagining R is true"},"1655":{"dur":3,"text":"because you don't want to imagine it."},"1658":{"dur":0,"text":"So you don't want to imagine"},"1659":{"dur":4,"text":"that Craig did the right thing in shooting Jack and Jill."},"1665":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, that also has some surface appeal."},"1670":{"dur":3,"text":"There does seem something uncomfortable"},"1673":{"dur":4,"text":"about imaginatively engaging with alien moral perspectives."},"1678":{"dur":1,"text":"Sometimes, I don't know about you,"},"1679":{"dur":2,"text":"but you might shun certain novels"},"1682":{"dur":1,"text":"because you know they're going to ask you"},"1683":{"dur":4,"text":"to take on perspectives that you don't want to think about,"},"1690":{"dur":2,"text":"particularly in the case of racist fiction"},"1692":{"dur":0,"text":"or sexist fiction,"},"1693":{"dur":4,"text":"you might just think, I don't want to imagine that stuff."},"1699":{"dur":4,"text":"However, that's really still not much of an explanation."},"1704":{"dur":2,"text":"Because why don't you want to imagine it?"},"1706":{"dur":2,"text":"It's only imagining, for all we know so far."},"1709":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not believing."},"1710":{"dur":1,"text":"No one's asking you to believe anything,"},"1712":{"dur":1,"text":"they're only asking you to imagine"},"1713":{"dur":1,"text":"that Craig did the right thing."},"1715":{"dur":1,"text":"So why should it be so difficult"},"1717":{"dur":3,"text":"to imagine that Craig did the right thing?"},"1721":{"dur":2,"text":"And another salient factor here seems to be,"},"1723":{"dur":3,"text":"take a fiction that many of us really don't,"},"1728":{"dur":2,"text":"we don't want to imaginatively engage with."},"1731":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm going to choose the example of American Psycho,"},"1733":{"dur":2,"text":"which I read not that long ago."},"1735":{"dur":3,"text":"I didn't want to imagine that stuff."},"1738":{"dur":3,"text":"But as soon as my eyes started scanning the text,"},"1742":{"dur":1,"text":"I did, I imagined it."},"1743":{"dur":2,"text":"So it seems like once you've started reading,"},"1745":{"dur":2,"text":"you cannot help but imagine even things"},"1748":{"dur":1,"text":"you really don't want to imagine."},"1750":{"dur":2,"text":"So if that's true, why shouldn't it be the case here?"},"1752":{"dur":1,"text":"Why shouldn't you just imagine"},"1754":{"dur":1,"text":"what you're being told to imagine,"},"1756":{"dur":2,"text":"even if you don't want to?"},"1759":{"dur":4,"text":"So, that looks like a solution with it's difficulties, too."},"1766":{"dur":2,"text":"So here's a different candidate explanation,"},"1768":{"dur":1,"text":"and this is one I'm going to focus on."},"1769":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not one I think is right,"},"1771":{"dur":3,"text":"but it's one that many people have thought right."},"1774":{"dur":2,"text":"Versions of this explanation are endorsed"},"1776":{"dur":2,"text":"by Kendall Walton, Stephen Yablo,"},"1781":{"dur":2,"text":"who else, Janet Levin, anyway."},"1789":{"dur":0,"text":"They differ in the detail,"},"1790":{"dur":2,"text":"but they all essentially endorse this claim,"},"1792":{"dur":3,"text":"which is, you can't imagine that R is true"},"1795":{"dur":2,"text":"because you can't believe that R would be true"},"1798":{"dur":3,"text":"in relevantly similar circumstances."},"1801":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm going to focus on that explanation now."},"1806":{"dur":2,"text":"So let's break it down into stages."},"1809":{"dur":1,"text":"The first assumption is,"},"1810":{"dur":1,"text":"in writing the sentence R,"},"1812":{"dur":2,"text":"remember the sentence R is the sentence about,"},"1815":{"dur":3,"text":"so Craig did the right thing in shooting Jack and Jill,"},"1818":{"dur":1,"text":"blah blah blah."},"1819":{"dur":2,"text":"So in writing R, the author of Death on a Freeway"},"1822":{"dur":3,"text":"intends the reader to imagine that R is true."},"1827":{"dur":1,"text":"They intend you to imagine it's true"},"1828":{"dur":2,"text":"that Craig did the right thing."},"1831":{"dur":3,"text":"I completely agree with that premise."},"1837":{"dur":2,"text":"To imagine that R is true,"},"1840":{"dur":1,"text":"and that is to do what the author"},"1842":{"dur":1,"text":"has instructed you to do,"},"1843":{"dur":3,"text":"the reader must generally believe that any real person"},"1846":{"dur":2,"text":"in a relevantly similar situation to Craig"},"1848":{"dur":2,"text":"would be doing the right thing."},"1852":{"dur":1,"text":"In order to imagine what you're being asked to do,"},"1854":{"dur":1,"text":"you have to have a belief."},"1855":{"dur":2,"text":"You have to believe that anyone"},"1857":{"dur":1,"text":"in a situation like Craig's,"},"1859":{"dur":4,"text":"who had just been in some traffic jam and that was it,"},"1866":{"dur":1,"text":"would, nonetheless, be doing the right thing"},"1867":{"dur":2,"text":"in shooting the source, Jack and Jill,"},"1869":{"dur":2,"text":"the source of the traffic jam."},"1872":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, next assumption is that as a reader"},"1875":{"dur":1,"text":"you can't believe that,"},"1876":{"dur":2,"text":"given the assumptions about your value set,"},"1879":{"dur":2,"text":"you can't believe that anyone in that situation"},"1882":{"dur":3,"text":"would be doing the right thing if they did that."},"1885":{"dur":2,"text":"So, you can't imagine it's true."},"1889":{"dur":2,"text":"There's an assumption that there's a close connection"},"1892":{"dur":2,"text":"between your ability to imagine certain things,"},"1894":{"dur":2,"text":"and your existing belief set,"},"1898":{"dur":2,"text":"or beliefs about what would be the case."},"1901":{"dur":1,"text":"So here's the underlying presupposition"},"1902":{"dur":1,"text":"of this explanation:"},"1904":{"dur":3,"text":"in order to imagine that R is the case in context C,"},"1907":{"dur":3,"text":"that is that Craig did the right thing"},"1912":{"dur":2,"text":"in the context he was in,"},"1914":{"dur":4,"text":"you need to believe that were context C actually the case,"},"1919":{"dur":1,"text":"R would be the case."},"1923":{"dur":2,"text":"So, that's the popular explanation"},"1926":{"dur":1,"text":"that, as I say, many philosophers"},"1928":{"dur":1,"text":"seem to be attracted to,"},"1929":{"dur":1,"text":"but I think there are some problems with it,"},"1931":{"dur":4,"text":"so I'm just going to go through a couple of these."},"1936":{"dur":2,"text":"The first problem, I think,"},"1940":{"dur":4,"text":"is that this explanation sets up a strange contrast"},"1945":{"dur":2,"text":"with the moral and the non-moral."},"1948":{"dur":1,"text":"Because it doesn't seem that principle"},"1949":{"dur":1,"text":"to operate in non-moral cases."},"1951":{"dur":1,"text":"So take Harry Potter."},"1956":{"dur":3,"text":"Harry Potter does magic when he waves his wand"},"1959":{"dur":3,"text":"and shouts, \"expelliarmus,\" I'm told."},"1964":{"dur":1,"text":"But you can imagine that."},"1966":{"dur":2,"text":"You don't need to believe that were someone"},"1968":{"dur":2,"text":"in relevantly similar circumstances to Harry,"},"1971":{"dur":2,"text":"and they waved their wand and shouted, \"expelliarmus,\""},"1973":{"dur":1,"text":"they would be doing magic,"},"1975":{"dur":2,"text":"because I take it you don't believe that."},"1977":{"dur":2,"text":"I take it that you don't believe"},"1979":{"dur":2,"text":"that someone waving their arms around"},"1981":{"dur":3,"text":"and shouting, \"expelliarmus\" would be doing magic."},"1985":{"dur":2,"text":"But you can imagine that they were."},"1988":{"dur":3,"text":"So that seems to me to be an example where,"},"1993":{"dur":1,"text":"so it's not a moral claim."},"1994":{"dur":1,"text":"There's no moral claim there."},"1995":{"dur":2,"text":"That's just a descriptive claim."},"1998":{"dur":1,"text":"But there looks like"},"2000":{"dur":2,"text":"it's perfectly okay, you can have the imagining,"},"2002":{"dur":1,"text":"you don't need any generalized belief"},"2004":{"dur":1,"text":"that if someone was in this situation"},"2005":{"dur":2,"text":"this would be happening."},"2009":{"dur":2,"text":"That's not, in itself, a knocked-down objection,"},"2012":{"dur":1,"text":"but it does suggest that,"},"2013":{"dur":3,"text":"it sets up a less-than-desirable contrast"},"2017":{"dur":1,"text":"between a moral and a non-moral,"},"2018":{"dur":1,"text":"because then we need an explanation of why"},"2020":{"dur":2,"text":"this principle only operates in the moral cases"},"2023":{"dur":1,"text":"but not the non-moral."},"2024":{"dur":1,"text":"It looks a bit ad hoc."},"2027":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's one problem."},"2028":{"dur":4,"text":"And the next problem is the problem of genre effects."},"2036":{"dur":1,"text":"Even when we just concentrate"},"2038":{"dur":2,"text":"on fictions which ask us to imagine"},"2041":{"dur":3,"text":"that certain alien moral propositions are true,"},"2045":{"dur":1,"text":"and we resist them,"},"2048":{"dur":4,"text":"well, even when we focus on the moral cases in fictions,"},"2052":{"dur":2,"text":"we don't always seem to resist."},"2056":{"dur":3,"text":"Even when we have a very structurally similar type of case,"},"2059":{"dur":1,"text":"if we switch the genre,"},"2061":{"dur":2,"text":"then there

climate change scientist"},"4390":{"dur":2,"text":"cannot imagine that they're wrong."},"4393":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm saying resistance will occur"},"4394":{"dur":1,"text":"in a very specific context."},"4396":{"dur":1,"text":"It's one where they're reading something"},"4397":{"dur":1,"text":"or they're being told something,"},"4398":{"dur":1,"text":"to imagine something by someone

believe."},"4405":{"dur":1,"text":"That they'll resist."},"4406":{"dur":3,"text":"So that demonstrates the locality of my explanation."},"4409":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not a global explanation about imagining generally,"},"4412":{"dur":3,"text":"it's about imagining the particular pragmatic context."},"4415":{"dur":3,"text":"But to your first bit, if that's okay,"},"4420":{"dur":2,"text":"it's true that in the Death on a Freeway,"},"4423":{"dur":3,"text":"he moves from various concrete descriptions"},"4426":{"dur":2,"text":"which could be easily mentally imaged"},"4429":{"dur":2,"text":"to

possible explanation which might come to mind"},"4445":{"dur":1,"text":"is, the reason I can't imagine that"},"4446":{"dur":2,"text":"is because I can't have a mental image"},"4449":{"dur":3,"text":"of rightness or wrongness, so that's resistance."},"4453":{"dur":1,"text":"But I tried to get round that,"},"4455":{"dur":2,"text":"or tried to reject that as a possibility"},"4457":{"dur":2,"text":"by giving you the Borges example,"},"4459":{"dur":2,"text":"because that seems a case where we can imagine that stuff,"},"4462":{"dur":1,"text":"but there's no imagery."},"4464":{"dur":2,"text":"So that was my quick route to trying"},"4466":{"dur":3,"text":"to see off that possible explanation."},"4469":{"dur":2,"text":"There are fictions which ask us"},"4472":{"dur":2,"text":"to imagine certain things are the case,"},"4474":{"dur":3,"text":"but there's no associated imagery we could really have."},"4477":{"dur":2,"text":"The things described are too abstract."},"4479":{"dur":1,"text":"But that doesn't seem a reason to deny"},"4480":{"dur":2,"text":"that we can imagine that they're the case,"},"4483":{"dur":3,"text":"in that propositional
