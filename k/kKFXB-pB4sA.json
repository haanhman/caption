had a pretty low\nmood, as you can imagine,"},"370":{"dur":3,"text":"and our relationship\neven suffered."},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"So we tried all kinds of\nthings, like I

we've"},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"been trying all these things\nand we've had some great relief,"},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"but let's talk about\nnutrition-- like,"},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"that's what I

I'm here to tell you\nthat food matters, what you eat"},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"matters-- every single meal."},"502":{"dur":3,"text":"What you had at lunch is\nnow actually in your brains,"},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"and it is bathing\nyour spinal cord,"},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"the discs, the vertebrae--\nas we speak, so food matters."},"517":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, let me tell you what good\nfood means since I told you"},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"good food earlier."},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"Half of you are\nprobably like, oh, God,"},"523":{"dur":1,"text":"she sounds like my mom."},"525":{"dur":3,"text":"The other half of you might\nbe skeptical saying, yeah,"},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"what does good food\nmean, and how's it"},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"going to affect my back?"},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, I'd like to tell you three\nways that good food does that."},"535":{"dur":4,"text":"The first one-- good food\nprovides the backbone-- sorry,"},"539":{"dur":4,"text":"no pun intended-- but the\nstructure for your brain,"},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"for your spinal\ncord, for your discs."},"546":{"dur":4,"text":"It is the gelatinous material\ninbetween every single one"},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"of your vertebraes\nin your knees,"},"552":{"dur":4,"text":"in your elbows--\nevery joint that you"},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"have is built out of nutrition."},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"Your body can't synthesize\nthose things on its own,"},"561":{"dur":2,"text":"it only comes from what you eat."},"564":{"dur":3,"text":"And besides providing\nstructure, good food"},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"also provides\nnutrients that protect"},"571":{"dur":3,"text":"those organs of the body from\nthe daily stressors of life"},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"but, also, from things\nthat we can't foresee,"},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"like trauma or injuries."},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"And then the third\nthing good food does"},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"is it provides pleasure."},"582":{"dur":3,"text":"And pleasure can\noftentimes mask pain,"},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"but there's even some\nresearch suggests"},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"that it can actually fix pain."},"590":{"dur":3,"text":"So, now, here's the\nscience, nitty gritty piece."},"594":{"dur":3,"text":"If your brain had\na recipe on it--"},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"and you're going through the\ncookbook in your kitchen,"},"600":{"dur":1,"text":"you're like, ah,\nbrain, sounds great."},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"How do I make a brain?"},"603":{"dur":5,"text":"The recipe, the ingredients,\nwould say lentils, beans."},"608":{"dur":3,"text":"It would say a good helping\nof fatty fish several times"},"612":{"dur":0,"text":"a week."},"613":{"dur":3,"text":"It would say avocados, nuts\nand seeds, and the oils"},"616":{"dur":1,"text":"from those things."},"618":{"dur":3,"text":"And it would also say\na whole bunch of water."},"621":{"dur":5,"text":"This same recipe would apply to\nthe fluid in your spinal cord,"},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"the coatings around\nall of the nerves"},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"that run miles through\nyour body, right."},"633":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, moving on to the harder\nstructures of your brain"},"636":{"dur":3,"text":"and your spine, the\nbones, and the cartilage,"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"there would be a\ndifferent recipe for that."},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"And the foods on\nthat ingredient list"},"644":{"dur":3,"text":"would be more like the\nlean meats and seafood."},"648":{"dur":3,"text":"It would be lean\ndairy or low fat dairy"},"651":{"dur":3,"text":"products and, primarily, foods\nthat have a lot of calcium,"},"655":{"dur":4,"text":"and zinc, phosphorus,\nmagnesium-- the real structures"},"659":{"dur":3,"text":"that provide the bone matrix."},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"And, like I said, your\nbody can't synthesize"},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"these out of thin air, they\ncome only from the foods"},"668":{"dur":1,"text":"that you eat."},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"And a good example in how\nfast these things can affect"},"672":{"dur":5,"text":"your spine is that in\nutero, when we were just"},"678":{"dur":5,"text":"the sparkle in our mom's\neye, we had already"},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"built a spine out of\nwhat our mother had"},"685":{"dur":2,"text":"been eating that day but\nalso months beforehand."},"688":{"dur":3,"text":"And we build those spines,\nthat nervous system,"},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"in just a few days as a fetus."},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"And so you can\nimagine the impact"},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"of everyday what\nour mom ate when"},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"we were in the stomach\nbut, also, the years"},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"that we've accumulated\noutside of the womb"},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"from eating three times a day."},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"You can imagine the\nimpact that the food"},"705":{"dur":3,"text":"has on your actual\nbrain structure, right?"},"712":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, moving on\nfrom structure, I'd"},"714":{"dur":1,"text":"like to also tell you\na little bit about what"},"716":{"dur":3,"text":"good food is for protection."},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"Good food offers protection\nto all those organs"},"722":{"dur":1,"text":"I just talked about."},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"Every day we have a lot\nof oxidative stress,"},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"meaning stress that we put\non ourselves-- emotional"},"729":{"dur":1,"text":"but also physical stress."},"730":{"dur":1,"text":"And that creates a lot\nof havoc in the body."},"732":{"dur":3,"text":"It creates free radicals,\nit creates tissue damage,"},"736":{"dur":1,"text":"and a lot of other\nthings that science"},"737":{"dur":3,"text":"doesn't quite even\nknow the right words"},"741":{"dur":1,"text":"to use to put on it."},"743":{"dur":5,"text":"But there's these magical foods\nout there that offer protection"},"749":{"dur":3,"text":"now, but also in the future\nto protect these organs."},"752":{"dur":4,"text":"And they're plants,\nplants are powerful."},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'm saying plants\ninstead of antioxidants"},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"for a very specific reason."},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"And that is because out\nof the last 30 years"},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"where we've really been focused\non looking at antioxidants"},"767":{"dur":3,"text":"as the cure-all, the\npanacea, for every ailment"},"770":{"dur":3,"text":"under the sun, the research\nhas been really depressing."},"774":{"dur":1,"text":"It's kind of sad."},"776":{"dur":2,"text":"And I've been the biggest\nproponent of it saying,"},"778":{"dur":3,"text":"gosh, I really hope that\nvitamin A, or vitamin C,"},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"or selenium might\nbe the answer to all"},"783":{"dur":3,"text":"of these different chronic\ndiseases, but none of them are."},"787":{"dur":4,"text":"Not even in high doses, not\nif you take them every day."},"791":{"dur":4,"text":"And the reason is because\nyou're taking a single one,"},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"all right, you're taking\na single nutrient."},"798":{"dur":4,"text":"And if you could open the\nback and look into the pain"},"803":{"dur":6,"text":"pathways of the body, you\nwould see this Matrix looking"},"809":{"dur":3,"text":"beautiful, beautiful system\nthat's thousands of thousands"},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"of chemicals interacting\nsimultaneously"},"815":{"dur":1,"text":"at any given moment."},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"Yes, there is vitamin\nA, and vitamin C,"},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"and zinc, and selenium\nin there interacting,"},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"but they don't act alone,\nand they're certainly not"},"823":{"dur":4,"text":"the biggest players\nin that pain cascade."},"827":{"dur":2,"text":"They are just one\nof the thousands."},"829":{"dur":2,"text":"So to think, as humans,\nthat we can somehow"},"832":{"dur":6,"text":"drive this reaction by taking\none or two nutrients is false."},"838":{"dur":0,"text":"It's not going to work."},"839":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, the supplement\ncompanies don't"},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"want you to know that\nbut, unfortunately,"},"843":{"dur":2,"text":"that's what the best\nscience says so far."},"846":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, there's a caveat to that."},"847":{"dur":2,"text":"And that is that if you\nare deficient in one"},"850":{"dur":2,"text":"of those antioxidants, and we\ncan do that through some blood"},"853":{"dur":1,"text":"tests and some other testing."},"855":{"dur":1,"text":"If you're deficient,\nbringing the levels"},"857":{"dur":3,"text":"back up to a healthy,\nnormal level certainly"},"860":{"dur":2,"text":"can offer you great\npain relief and also"},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"protection, day in and day out."},"866":{"dur":2,"text":"But, above and beyond\nadequate levels,"},"868":{"dur":3,"text":"we don't find that super doses\nof any single antioxidant"},"871":{"dur":2,"text":"works, but plants do."},"874":{"dur":1,"text":"Plants are good food."},"876":{"dur":1,"text":"And the reason I\nhave this slide up"},"877":{"dur":4,"text":"is to show you that about half\nof your meals-- and, in fact,"},"882":{"dur":1,"text":"let me rephrase that."},"883":{"dur":5,"text":"At least half of your meals\nthat you eat every single day"},"888":{"dur":2,"text":"should be from plants."},"891":{"dur":4,"text":"They harness this amazing\npower, this antioxidant blend,"},"895":{"dur":4,"text":"that no pill, no medication,\nwill ever be able to offer you."},"899":{"dur":3,"text":"It's in the right amounts, it's\nin the right

fact, eating\nseasonally will offer you"},"912":{"dur":1,"text":"that variety-- then\nyou are getting"},"914":{"dur":2,"text":"the right dose of antioxidants."},"920":{"dur":3,"text":"Good food also means good fluid."},"924":{"dur":3,"text":"Good fluids and good foods\nare really one and the same."},"928":{"dur":4,"text":"Hydration is probably one\nof the least utilized tools"},"932":{"dur":2,"text":"in the pain management tool kit."},"935":{"dur":3,"text":"I cannot tell you how many times\nI've seen patients in the pain"},"938":{"dur":4,"text":"clinic that when I
