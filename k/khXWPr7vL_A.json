Introduction."},"696":{"dur":3,"text":"And most modules will have this\nkind of introductory material,"},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's what you do in this\nsort of first three weeks"},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"before your module actually\nbegins, because although you"},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"have access to the\nmodule website,"},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"you won't have your

friend"},"797":{"dur":1,"text":"throughout the whole journey."},"799":{"dur":0,"text":"GEORGINA BLAKELEY: That's right."},"800":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah, most modules will\nhave a mixture of books,"},"802":{"dur":1,"text":"and they'll also have\na mixture of materials"},"804":{"dur":1,"text":"that you get on the VLE."},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"That would be audio\/video\nactivities, that kind of thing."},"808":{"dur":1,"text":"But this tells you what to do."},"810":{"dur":4,"text":"So at some point, you'll see\nas you kind of scroll down,"},"814":{"dur":3,"text":"it will tell you to\nwork with the chapter."},"817":{"dur":3,"text":"And there you see it\nworking with Chapter 1."},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"So it does actually tell\nyou when to read the books."},"823":{"dur":2,"text":"Obviously, you don't have\nto go online to do that."},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"More or less you'll be\nreading a chapter every week."},"828":{"dur":0,"text":"GEORGINA BLAKELEY: Yeah."},"829":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah, you can go\nonline to do that."},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"If you-- some people do prefer\nto read on screens these days."},"833":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not one of them."},"834":{"dur":1,"text":"I like my traditional book."},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"But you can click on\nthat, and it will take you"},"838":{"dur":2,"text":"to a PDF of the Chapter

finally useful."},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm trying not to get\nfrustrated about that."},"857":{"dur":1,"text":"But, yeah, it's a\nvery good maths mat."},"859":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Brilliant."},"860":{"dur":2,"text":"Oh, by the way, we've put\na widget up as well about"},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"whether or not you are\ninterested in face-to-face or"},"865":{"dur":0,"text":"online

it's watching a\nvideo, listening to an audio,"},"893":{"dur":2,"text":"or doing a skills\nactivity, will tell"},"895":{"dur":2,"text":"you approximately how much\ntime you need to do it."},"898":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's really good\nfor planning your time"},"900":{"dur":3,"text":"because, to be honest, if I\nwas a kind of new student,"},"903":{"dur":2,"text":"and I open this up, and I\nthink, oh, my goodness, me."},"906":{"dur":1,"text":"I've got to do all\nthat in one week?"},"908":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's quite daunting."},"909":{"dur":2,"text":"You see this kind of a really,\nreally long list of all"},"911":{"dur":1,"text":"these different things to do."},"913":{"dur":1,"text":"And you don't know what they\nmean because you haven't"},"914":{"dur":1,"text":"sort of looked at them yet."},"916":{"dur":2,"text":"But it's worth bearing in\nmind that, yes, some of them"},"918":{"dur":0,"text":"will take a while."},"919":{"dur":1,"text":"So some of them will\ntake an hour to do."},"921":{"dur":3,"text":"This one says you need\nabout 25 minutes to do it."},"924":{"dur":2,"text":"But other ones will\njust take 10 minutes."},"926":{"dur":3,"text":"So although it looks\ndaunting, each week"},"930":{"dur":3,"text":"is generally about sort of\n14, 15 hours of study a week."},"933":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: OK."},"934":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, that's quite interesting."},"935":{"dur":1,"text":"And then bearing in mind\nthat a lot of our students"},"937":{"dur":1,"text":"here are Level 1,\njust looking at this,"},"939":{"dur":1,"text":"I can see that there's\nsome stuff that's"},"941":{"dur":1,"text":"relevant to the subject area."},"942":{"dur":1,"text":"But there's also skills."},"944":{"dur":3,"text":"There's skimming and\nscan reading and tips."},"947":{"dur":2,"text":"And those are built into the\nstructure of the modules,"},"949":{"dur":1,"text":"in particular at Level 1."},"950":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're not expecting\nstudents to all of a sudden"},"952":{"dur":1,"text":"be geniuses at\nnote-taking, for example--"},"954":{"dur":2,"text":"although you might be at\nthe end of this session."},"956":{"dur":3,"text":"But in all

content."},"964":{"dur":3,"text":"How important is it, then, would\nyou say to do those activities?"},"967":{"dur":1,"text":"Bearing in mind sometimes\nyou think, oh, I"},"969":{"dur":1,"text":"don't have time this\nweek to do note-taking."},"971":{"dur":1,"text":"I know how to take notes."},"972":{"dur":1,"text":"I've watched the\nStudent Hub Live."},"974":{"dur":3,"text":"How important is it to engage\nwith the skills as well"},"977":{"dur":0,"text":"as the content?"},"978":{"dur":2,"text":"GEORGINA BLAKELEY: I think it's\nabsolutely super important."},"981":{"dur":1,"text":"And I know I would say that."},"982":{"dur":1,"text":"But it is because\neven if you think,"},"984":{"dur":1,"text":"actually I can\nwrite really well."},"986":{"dur":2,"text":"Just by doing these activities--\nand sometimes I look at them"},"989":{"dur":1,"text":"myself, and other\nmodules-- there's"},"991":{"dur":1,"text":"still something you can learn."},"992":{"dur":1,"text":"So even if you feel\nquite confident,"},"994":{"dur":1,"text":"it's worth having\na look and seeing"},"996":{"dur":3,"text":"what tips you can pick up and\nimprove the note-taking skills"},"999":{"dur":2,"text":"that you think you already have."},"1002":{"dur":1,"text":"But for new students,\nparticularly, I"},"1004":{"dur":2,"text":"think it builds your

expect you to know\nanything, which is why you're"},"1019":{"dur":2,"text":"starting with a Level 1 module."},"1021":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think it's really important\nto do these skills activities."},"1025":{"dur":2,"text":"And we tend to use the\nmaterials that you'll"},"1027":{"dur":3,"text":"study, so kind of topics that\nyou're interested in, to teach"},"1030":{"dur":1,"text":"the skills through them."},"1031":{"dur":3,"text":"So you're not doing a sort of\nstand-alone skills activity."},"1034":{"dur":2,"text":"You're using the kinds\nof materials, the films,"},"1037":{"dur":2,"text":"the audios, on topics that\nyou're interested in studying."},"1040":{"dur":2,"text":"So that helps you to do\nthem as well I think."},"1042":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: I wanted\nto ask you something,"},"1043":{"dur":2,"text":"because sometimes you\nhave these activities"},"1045":{"dur":1,"text":"and they have this box."},"1047":{"dur":3,"text":"And then they'll say, write--\nwrite something in this box."},"1050":{"dur":1,"text":"Who can see that box?"},"1051":{"dur":1,"text":"GEORGINA BLAKELEY: Nobody."},"1052":{"dur":0,"text":"Shall we have a look at one?"},"1053":{"dur":2,"text":"GEORGINA BLAKELEY: I'm going\nto just click on this one."},"1056":{"dur":2,"text":"It's part of a wider\nskills

do."},"1064":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is about hard\nwords and tricky sentences,"},"1067":{"dur":2,"text":"because often the language\nwe use as social scientists,"},"1070":{"dur":1,"text":"or whatever discipline\nit is you're studying,"},"1072":{"dur":2,"text":"might seem a bit odd if it's not\nthe sort of everyday language"},"1075":{"dur":1,"text":"you're used to."},"1076":{"dur":1,"text":"So this tells you to\nread the first paragraph"},"1078":{"dur":3,"text":"and then jot down in the box\nany words or phrases that"},"1082":{"dur":1,"text":"are unfamiliar to you."},"1083":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, if I was\nbeing a bit naughty"},"1085":{"dur":2,"text":"I could just write XXX\nor blah, blah, blah,"},"1088":{"dur":2,"text":"because I'm really\ninterested in the discussion."},"1090":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't have time to do this."},"1091":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm just going to\ndo it very quickly."},"1092":{"dur":1,"text":"So let's see if you can do

helps you\nto see if you're"},"1103":{"dur":2,"text":"on the right track with the\nkind of answers that you put in."},"1105":{"dur":1,"text":"So OK, although I've\nbeen a bit naughty"},"1107":{"dur":2,"text":"there-- I wouldn't recommend\nyou do that every time."},"1110":{"dur":2,"text":"Sometimes you can do that\nbecause you don't have the time"},"1112":{"dur":1,"text":"and you just actually\nwant to quickly get"},"1113":{"dur":1,"text":"to sort of, what are the\nmain points you should"},"1115":{"dur":1,"text":"be getting out of an activity?"},"1117":{"dur":2,"text":"But if you do have the\ntime, and most times"},"1119":{"dur":2,"text":"you will, hopefully you\nwrite your own answers"},"1122":{"dur":2,"text":"and then you compare\nit to what's there."},"1124":{"dur":2,"text":"It'll be similar but\nnot exactly the same."},"1126":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: It's funny\nbecause these things-- I do"},"1127":{"dur":1,"text":"think there is often\na temptation to think,"},"1129":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't have time for this."},"1131":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to go through it."},"1132":{"dur":2,"text":"But actually, I've seen\nin a lot of tutorials"},"1134":{"dur":2,"text":"these are the sorts of\nthings that we might do."},"1136":{"dur":1,"text":"We might say,\nhere's an activity."},"1137":{"dur":1,"text":"Have a look at this\nand write this down."},"1139":{"dur":2,"text":"And actually, hand\non heart, you do"},"1141":{"dur":2,"text":"get a lot of learning\nfrom doing it yourself."},"1143":{"dur":0,"text":"GEORGINA BLAKELEY: Absolutely."},"1144":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: You\ndo pick things up."},"1145":{"dur":1,"text":"And also it's important\nto

are."},"1150":{"dur":1,"text":"GEORGINA BLAKELEY: That's right."},"1151":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, Karen\nsaid-- you're right."},"1154":{"dur":3,"text":"Your tutor doesn't see your\nanswers, so you can do this."},"1157":{"dur":1,"text":"But it's really\nuseful if you think"},"1159":{"dur":2,"text":"you're struggling with\nsomething to tell your tutor,"},"1161":{"dur":2,"text":"I had a go at this activity,\nand I couldn't do it."},"1163":{"dur":0,"text":"Can you help me?"},"1164":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's a good gauge of where\nyou are and how you're doing."},"1167":{"dur":1,"text":"And you will find when\nyou go to Tutorials"},"1169":{"dur":2,"text":"as well that sometimes\ntutors uses those activities."},"1171":{"dur":1,"text":"So let's have a\nlook at this one."},"1173":{"dur":1,"text":"Everyone was\nstruggling with this,"},"1174":{"dur":2,"text":"so let's see what the answers\nare and how we can get to them."},"1177":{"dur":2,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: I might use those\nbecause all my students are"},"1179":{"dur":1,"text":"probably going to do now."},"1180":{"dur":1,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"1182":{"dur":1,"text":"Brilliant."},"1184":{"dur":0,"text":"OK, so this is good."},"1185":{"dur":1,"text":"So we've got a\nlot of activities."},"1187":{"dur":1,"text":"We've got a lot of ways\nof getting to things."},"1189":{"dur":1,"text":"There's also\nstaggered assessments"},"1190":{"dur":2,"text":"throughout the study\nplanner as well."},"1192":{"dur":3,"text":"And the thing that I like\nabout the study planner,"},"1196":{"dur":2,"text":"and I think why it's such a good\nsource of central information,"},"1199":{"dur":1,"text":"is that everything is there."},"1200":{"dur":3,"text":"So whilst you can navigate,\nas you say, in other ways,"},"1204":{"dur":1,"text":"this central column\nof the study planner"},"1205":{"dur":2,"text":"contains all of the links\nthat you need progressively"},"1208":{"dur":1,"text":"to get

you can\nget to the assessments"},"1248":{"dur":2,"text":"through the study planner,\nas we've just said,"},"1251":{"dur":3,"text":"if you scroll down here you\ncan see on the right-hand

work\nout ways around it."},"1295":{"dur":1,"text":"And there are ways\naround it, but you"},"1296":{"dur":2,"text":"need to give your\ntutor plenty of time"},"1298":{"dur":1,"text":"and tell them that's\nan issue coming up."},"1300":{"dur":2,"text":"The other thing to get down\nin your diary, of course,"},"1302":{"dur":1,"text":"are all the different\nlearning

not\ncompulsory, because we"},"1317":{"dur":2,"text":"know that students very\ncomplicated lives often."},"1320":{"dur":2,"text":"But we do recommend that you\ntry and attend some if you
