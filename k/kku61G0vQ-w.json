Well, first off, she lived in Niu, and\nshe lived on Halemaumau Street, at the head"},"1066":{"dur":3,"text":"of a little\nentrance into the valley. So, there were all"},"1070":{"dur":2,"text":"these little houses around, down below, and\nthen you drove up"},"1073":{"dur":6,"text":"this road. It went from uh, asphalt to dirt.\nAnd then, you got into this valley, and there"},"1079":{"dur":3,"text":"was a pasture\nthere with horses, and there were two or three"},"1082":{"dur":3,"text":"houses. And that was her place. And so, it\nbecame almost"},"1086":{"dur":5,"text":"rural. You went from Honolulu, you went to\nNiu, you went to this subdivision, and then,"},"1092":{"dur":2,"text":"all of a sudden\nyou were back in-you could be anywhere. You"},"1094":{"dur":2,"text":"could be on the Big Island. And all around\nher lived her"},"1097":{"dur":6,"text":"children.
