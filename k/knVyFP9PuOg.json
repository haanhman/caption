faculty"},"381":{"dur":3,"text":"and grad students play more influential\nroles in the lives of undergraduates,"},"384":{"dur":6,"text":"where students learn and grow outside the\nclassroom, and where

2019,"},"407":{"dur":4,"text":"every student who enters Dartmouth will be\nplaced into one of six house communities."},"412":{"dur":5,"text":"Each community will have a cluster\nof residence halls as a home base."},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"And from sophomore year on, students will reside"},"421":{"dur":3,"text":"within their residential community\nwhenever they live within our dorms."},"424":{"dur":5,"text":"But even if a student is living in a first-year\ndorm, a Greek house, an affinity house,"},"430":{"dur":4,"text":"a live-learn community, or off campus,\nthey will

membership."},"444":{"dur":5,"text":"As part of this initiative, each residential\ncommunity will organize and host social"},"449":{"dur":4,"text":"and academic programs, and eventually\neach will have dedicated space"},"454":{"dur":1,"text":"for study and social interaction."},"456":{"dur":4,"text":"We are committing in excess of $1\nmillion per year to support programming"},"461":{"dur":3,"text":"within the residential communities\nand other college venues."},"466":{"dur":5,"text":"Each residential community will have a house\nprofessor and graduate students in residence."},"471":{"dur":4,"text":"And we will begin interviewing interested\nfaculty within the next few weeks,"},"476":{"dur":3,"text":"so that they can spearhead faculty\nand student

where sexual assault"},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"and high-risk drinking are\neradicated from our campus."},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"Over the past few years, we have\ntaken a number of steps to this end."},"584":{"dur":4,"text":"Last June, we adopted a zero-tolerance\nsexual assault disciplinary policy,"},"589":{"dur":6,"text":"with mandatory expulsion in the most egregious\ncases, and have moved to a new model providing"},"596":{"dur":4,"text":"for a professional investigation process\nwith a trained, independent investigator."},"601":{"dur":4,"text":"We have introduced a customized Bystander\nTraining program that trains students"},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"to help prevent assault before it occurs."},"609":{"dur":4,"text":"And I know many of you students have\nparticipated in that training and I thank you."},"615":{"dur":4,"text":"Starting next year we will introduce\na comprehensive, four-year education"},"619":{"dur":5,"text":"and awareness program for students as well as\nfirst-responder training for faculty and staff."},"626":{"dur":3,"text":"We will roll out a Dartmouth\nspecific smart-phone safety app."},"630":{"dur":5,"text":"Let the message be heard: we have and we\nwill continue to take every proven step"},"636":{"dur":4,"text":"to prevent sexual assault and to\nrespond promptly and fairly to reports."},"641":{"dur":4,"text":"When it comes to a safe environment, and\none that is advantageous to learning,"},"646":{"dur":5,"text":"we know that excessive drinking is one\nof the most pressing challenges we face."},"651":{"dur":4,"text":"Over the past four years, the DCHIP\nProgram has brought us measurable"},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"and impressive improvements."},"658":{"dur":5,"text":"But still, the Steering Committee found\nthat high risk drinking is far too prevalent"},"664":{"dur":5,"text":"on our campus and that in the vast majority\nof alcohol-induced medical transports,"},"670":{"dur":5,"text":"it is hard alcohol -- rather than beer or wine\n-- that lands students on a hospital gurney."},"677":{"dur":4,"text":"Dartmouth will take the lead among colleges\nin banning hard alcohol on our campus."},"683":{"dur":4,"text":"Undergraduate students will not be\npermitted to possess or consume hard alcohol"},"687":{"dur":6,"text":"in residential spaces or on other college\nproperty, and hard alcohol will not be served"},"694":{"dur":4,"text":"at events sponsored by college-recognized\norganizations."},"699":{"dur":4,"text":"Penalties for students found in\npossession of hard alcohol will ramp up,"},"703":{"dur":4,"text":"as will penalties for those who purchase\nand provide hard alcohol to minors."},"709":{"dur":5,"text":"And I am asking the entire campus community\nto follow suit and not serve hard alcohol"},"714":{"dur":1,"text":"at college-sponsored events on campus."},"718":{"dur":5,"text":"These initiatives will pave the way to a campus\nthat is safer and free of extreme behaviors."},"724":{"dur":6,"text":"But true and lasting change will not come\nfrom top-down policies like these alone."},"731":{"dur":4,"text":"It will come from individuals and\norganizations committing to live"},"736":{"dur":1,"text":"up to a higher standard of behavior."},"738":{"dur":5,"text":"And so, third, we will clarify\nand strengthen expectations"},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"of individuals and student organizations."},"747":{"dur":4,"text":"Today, I want to return to a question\nthat I posed in my inauguration speech."},"752":{"dur":6,"text":"I want every member of the community\nto ask yourself: will your actions"},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"and decisions elevate our\ncommunity and advance our mission?"},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"Or will they set us back?"},"764":{"dur":5,"text":"To clarify what we expect of individuals, every\nstudent who enrolls at Dartmouth will be asked"},"770":{"dur":2,"text":"to sign a code of conduct beginning next fall."},"773":{"dur":6,"text":"It will articulate the high expectations -- as\nthey relate to civility, dignity, diversity,"},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"community, and safety -- that\nwe have for Dartmouth students."},"785":{"dur":5,"text":"These are the fundamentals for every graduate\nwho wants to go out into the world and lead."},"791":{"dur":5,"text":"There are some actions and behaviors\nthat no policy can change or regulate."},"798":{"dur":5,"text":"The vile practices online, such\nas bullying and anonymous threats"},"803":{"dur":2,"text":"and attacks, fall into this category."},"806":{"dur":3,"text":"For these behaviors, a student code\nof conduct is particularly germane."},"811":{"dur":6,"text":"Our expectation is that students at Dartmouth\nact with the same integrity in the shadow"},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"of the Internet as they do in the light of day."},"819":{"dur":4,"text":"And a student code of conduct will\nmake this expectation undeniable."},"825":{"dur":3,"text":"Simultaneously, we are going to\nclarify and strengthen accountability"},"828":{"dur":5,"text":"for student organizations -- especially\nas it relates to hosting social events."},"834":{"dur":3,"text":"So on this topic, I would\nlike to speak in particular"},"838":{"dur":2,"text":"about the complex issue of\nGreek life at Dartmouth."},"842":{"dur":2,"text":"Over the past several months,\nmany have suggested"},"844":{"dur":2,"text":"that we eliminate fraternities\nand sororities and co-eds."},"849":{"dur":4,"text":"Many others have articulated the positive\noutcomes of Greek life and advocated"},"854":{"dur":2,"text":"for reform rather than elimination."},"857":{"dur":3,"text":"At my request, the Steering Committee\nlooked at colleges and universities"},"861":{"dur":3,"text":"that have minimal Greek life and\nthose that have intense Greek life."},"865":{"dur":2,"text":"And they researched, and in some cases visited,"},"868":{"dur":3,"text":"institutions that have already\nabolished fraternities and sororities."},"873":{"dur":6,"text":"And their research found that every one of our\npeers, regardless of the history and intensity"},"880":{"dur":4,"text":"of the Greek scene, struggles mightily with high\nlevels of harmful behaviors on their campus."},"885":{"dur":5,"text":"I have given much thought to the future of\nfraternities and sororities on our campus,"},"891":{"dur":3,"text":"taking into account the input I've received\nand the work of the Steering Committee."},"896":{"dur":4,"text":"And ultimately, I do not believe that\nsimply eliminating this one aspect"},"900":{"dur":4,"text":"of campus life will be a\ncomprehensive or even effective solution"},"904":{"dur":2,"text":"to the more pervasive challenges we face."},"907":{"dur":4,"text":"It would not adequately address the\ncharge I placed before our community"},"912":{"dur":4,"text":"of purging extreme behaviors\nwherever they occur on campus."},"917":{"dur":4,"text":"Having said that, I maintain\nthat Greek organizations,"},"922":{"dur":5,"text":"and indeed all student organizations\nat Dartmouth, must and will be held"},"927":{"dur":5,"text":"to much higher standards and a far greater level\nof accountability than they ever have before."},"934":{"dur":5,"text":"To be clear, when I speak of accountability,\nwhat I do not mean is simply being accountable"},"940":{"dur":4,"text":"for following rules -- for issuing\nwristbands or registering parties"},"944":{"dur":2,"text":"or maintaining strict sign-in procedures."},"947":{"dur":5,"text":"I speak of an expectation that student\norganizations will exhibit behavior befitting"},"953":{"dur":6,"text":"Dartmouth's mission and name; that ultimately\nstudent organizations will contribute"},"959":{"dur":5,"text":"to an environment that is respectful and\ninclusive and conducive to shaping leaders"},"965":{"dur":5,"text":"for the future; that they seek to elevate\nand not denigrate the Dartmouth experience."},"972":{"dur":4,"text":"And so I have asked the Dean of the College\nto clarify in writing what we will expect"},"976":{"dur":2,"text":"of all student organizations and to put"},"978":{"dur":4,"text":"in place an annual review process\nto confirm those expectations."},"983":{"dur":6,"text":"This will include an expectation that no student\norganization will encourage hazing or engage"},"990":{"dur":5,"text":"in pledge terms of any kind, and\nthat organizations will take steps"},"995":{"dur":3,"text":"to be inclusive and diversify their membership."},"999":{"dur":2,"text":"Going forward, it will be simple."},"1002":{"dur":4,"text":"Organizations that choose not to fulfill\nthese higher standards will not be part"},"1007":{"dur":0,"text":"of our community."},"1008":{"dur":5,"text":"Let me say that I am pleased and I am\noptimistic about the progress I have seen"},"1013":{"dur":3,"text":"by student organizations during\nthe past year, in their willingness"},"1017":{"dur":2,"text":"to increase accountability\nand root out extreme behavior."},"1021":{"dur":5,"text":"The proposal advanced by the Greek Leadership\nCouncil this fall introduces a comprehensive set"},"1027":{"dur":4,"text":"of reforms which includes\nsteps like the elimination"},"1031":{"dur":4,"text":"of pledge term (which they have\nalready enacted), requiring every house"},"1036":{"dur":6,"text":"to have active advisors of more than one\ngender, and requiring each fraternity to commit"},"1042":{"dur":3,"text":"at least 15% of their social\/programming\nbudget for financial aid."},"1047":{"dur":1,"text":"That is just a sampling of their proposals."},"1049":{"dur":3,"text":"Taken together, this set of actions\nintroduces more serious reform"},"1053":{"dur":2,"text":"to the system than we have seen in 50 years."},"1057":{"dur":1,"text":"But they have to follow through."},"1058":{"dur":3,"text":"And it is my hope that this is only\nthe beginning of much more to come."},"1062":{"dur":10,"text":"And so lastly, we will strengthen academic rigor\nand enhance learning outside the classroom."},"1072":{"dur":4,"text":"Our vision is for Dartmouth to be a\ncollege where every experience contributes"},"1077":{"dur":3,"text":"to building leaders with the\nwisdom for a complex world."},"1081":{"dur":6,"text":"To achieve this vision, we will work to\ncreate a more vigorous academic environment."},"1088":{"dur":4,"text":"We will infuse campus life with more\nopportunities for learning and growth."},"1093":{"dur":1,"text":"On this, the faculty must lead."},"1095":{"dur":5,"text":"And today I am asking their help in a number\nof areas -- from curbing grade inflation,"},"1101":{"dur":5,"text":"to not cancelling classes around\ncelebration weekends, limiting lay-ups,"},"1106":{"dur":3,"text":"to earlier start times for classes\non Tuesday and Thursday mornings."},"1111":{"dur":4,"text":"Just think students, those of you\nhere today, instead of listening to me"},"1115":{"dur":1,"text":"in the future, you could be in class."},"1117":{"dur":3,"text":"[ Laughter ]"},"1121":{"dur":5,"text":"At the same time, I am asking faculty and staff\nto play a larger and more influential role"},"1126":{"dur":3,"text":"in the lives of students to\npromote learning and growth 24\/7."},"1131":{"dur":4,"text":"To that end, I am announcing today a major\ninvestment to expand experiential learning"},"1136":{"dur":5,"text":"at Dartmouth, including the creation of a\ncenter within DCAL that will provide expertise"},"1141":{"dur":3,"text":"and financial resources for\nfaculty and students and staff"},"1145":{"dur":2,"text":"to pilot new experiential\nlearning opportunities."},"1149":{"dur":4,"text":"So, these are the steps that we\nwill take to Move Dartmouth forward."},"1154":{"dur":2,"text":"We will fundamentally transform\nresidential life,"},"1157":{"dur":3,"text":"and in doing so make Dartmouth\na more inclusive community."},"1161":{"dur":4,"text":"We will work to promote a safer\nand healthier campus environment."},"1168":{"dur":5,"text":"We will increase expectations of\nindividuals and student organizations."},"1174":{"dur":4,"text":"And we will strengthen academic\nrigor, while expanding opportunities"},"1178":{"dur":1,"text":"for learning outside the classroom."},"1180":{"dur":6,"text":"And to ensure these actions do in fact\nmark a turning point in our history,"},"1187":{"dur":3,"text":"I have convened an external\nOversight Committee to be chaired"},"1191":{"dur":4,"text":"by Tufts President Emeritus Larry\nBacow to evaluate our
