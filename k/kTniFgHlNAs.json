where do you wanna start?"},"97":{"dur":6,"text":"Well, I\u2019ve noticed over the years that most\npeople do have difficulty simplifying their"},"104":{"dur":1,"text":"message."},"105":{"dur":3,"text":"And the interesting thing about this is that\nmost people don't even\u2026 well, many people"},"108":{"dur":2,"text":"don't realize

something\nlike that."},"126":{"dur":4,"text":"So everybody needs to know what\u2019s most promotable\nabout themself."},"131":{"dur":5,"text":"And there are four ways that you can really\nhone in on that and up the ante."},"136":{"dur":6,"text":"Number one, I always say you need to meet\npeople where they are to take them where you"},"142":{"dur":1,"text":"want them to go."},"144":{"dur":1,"text":"So what does that mean?"},"145":{"dur":5,"text":"That means you need to figure out what the\nperson you\u2019re communicating with cares about."},"150":{"dur":1,"text":"Ok?"},"151":{"dur":3,"text":"So I could be talking about one person or\nI could be talking about millions of people"},"155":{"dur":1,"text":"in an audience."},"157":{"dur":1,"text":"Same concept."},"158":{"dur":4,"text":"Once you figure out what they care about,\nthen that\u2019s your point of entry."},"162":{"dur":1,"text":"Then you go from there."},"164":{"dur":1,"text":"Ok."},"165":{"dur":3,"text":"So let me give you an example."},"168":{"dur":5,"text":"When I was producing, sometimes folks would\ncall up and they\u2019d pitch me something."},"174":{"dur":4,"text":"And it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate for the show."},"178":{"dur":3,"text":"And I would\u2019ve sensed that they probably\nwere not watching the show, so sometimes I"},"182":{"dur":3,"text":"would ask them, \u201cDo you watch the show?\u201d"},"185":{"dur":4,"text":"And they inevitably would say no or, \u201cI\nhaven\u2019t watched it in a long time.\u201d"},"190":{"dur":1,"text":"And both of those don't really work."},"192":{"dur":1,"text":"Obviously you need to be watching the show."},"193":{"dur":5,"text":"But also, you need to be watching it currently\nbecause shows change over a period of time."},"199":{"dur":1,"text":"Shows can sometimes change very quickly."},"200":{"dur":1,"text":"Right."},"201":{"dur":3,"text":"So I would encourage them to go back and watch\nthe show and if they still felt like there"},"205":{"dur":3,"text":"was an appropriate pitch to come back to me."},"209":{"dur":4,"text":"And this is something that everybody can keep\nin mind any time they\u2019re pitching."},"214":{"dur":4,"text":"I would encourage anybody to watch a show\nfor at least a week before they consider pitching"},"218":{"dur":1,"text":"it."},"219":{"dur":3,"text":"Another thing that\u2019s really important to\nkeep in mind is that every pitch should be"},"223":{"dur":1,"text":"personalized."},"224":{"dur":4,"text":"Sometimes people send out 100 pitches, 250\npitches, whatever the number is."},"229":{"dur":4,"text":"Let me tell you, producers know when they\u2019re\ngetting those pitches and you want the pitches"},"233":{"dur":2,"text":"to be personalized for that show."},"236":{"dur":2,"text":"And even if you can, for that producer."},"238":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah."},"239":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, there\u2019s something really important\nthat you said and if anybody watching you\u2019re"},"243":{"dur":3,"text":"like, \u201cWell, this doesn't relate to me because\nI don't necessarily wanna get on TV,\u201d this"},"247":{"dur":5,"text":"relates to you if you wanna pitch yourself\nfor a job, if you want a new client, if you\u2019re"},"252":{"dur":3,"text":"trying to get on a particular blog, if you\u2019re\u2026\nanything."},"256":{"dur":4,"text":"That personalization, I can\u2019t tell you,\nRachel, how many

do you even know\u2026?\u201d"},"267":{"dur":1,"text":"They spell, first of all, they call me Maria."},"269":{"dur":2,"text":"And I\u2019m like, \u201cYou really think that\u2019s\ngonna get you anywhere?\u201d"},"271":{"dur":4,"text":"But\u2026 so, anyway, just to put a pin in your\npoint about the personalization piece, it"},"276":{"dur":1,"text":"is so important."},"277":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, it\u2019s funny that you mention that\nbecause I was talking to a friend of mine"},"280":{"dur":3,"text":"when I was getting ready to do this interview\nwith you and she said, \u201cYou know, sometimes"},"284":{"dur":4,"text":"they spell my name wrong, sometimes they even\nsend me a letter that was meant for a different"},"288":{"dur":1,"text":"show.\u201d"},"289":{"dur":5,"text":"And, I mean, you wanna let the producer know\nthat you really care and that you\u2019ve put"},"295":{"dur":5,"text":"the kind of effort into it that anybody would\nwant if they were being pitched."},"300":{"dur":1,"text":"It\u2019s really important."},"302":{"dur":4,"text":"So curious from you, from all the years working\non Oprah and Anderson Cooper and everything"},"306":{"dur":3,"text":"that you\u2019ve done, have you ever seen someone\ntry to pitch you and they\u2019ve kinda got it"},"310":{"dur":3,"text":"all wrong, you know they didn't watch the\nshow, but did anyone ever come back and get"},"314":{"dur":1,"text":"it right and totally wow you?"},"315":{"dur":3,"text":"Or do they lose credibility just right from\nthe get go and they never really circle back?"},"319":{"dur":5,"text":"You know, any time something ends up on TV\nit\u2019s a collaboration between the producing"},"325":{"dur":3,"text":"team and the person who\u2019s gonna be on the\nshow."},"328":{"dur":2,"text":"So there\u2019s always an evolution."},"330":{"dur":4,"text":"Maybe something isn\u2019t quite a fit but then\nthe producer has a way to make it a fit."},"335":{"dur":4,"text":"But generally what people wanna realize is\nyour credibility is always on the line."},"339":{"dur":7,"text":"So if you\u2019re pitching something that\u2019s\njust completely inappropriate, it says something"},"347":{"dur":1,"text":"about you."},"348":{"dur":5,"text":"Not to say that there\u2019s no way to overcome\nthat, but it can say something about you."},"353":{"dur":1,"text":"And it does."},"354":{"dur":4,"text":"I wanted to ask you that because I think it\u2019s\nreally important for all of us to recognize"},"359":{"dur":1,"text":"we all have memories."},"360":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes."},"361":{"dur":1,"text":"And our reputation is important."},"362":{"dur":3,"text":"So to take the time to really do this right\nfrom the get go, it's vital."},"366":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah."},"367":{"dur":5,"text":"And to think of it in a positive way, I remember\nthe people that really got it and those are"},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"the people that I wanna go back to."},"376":{"dur":1,"text":"You know?"},"377":{"dur":5,"text":"Over time because everybody wants to work\nwith people who get it, whatever it is that"},"382":{"dur":1,"text":"they do."},"383":{"dur":1,"text":"Right?"},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"That\u2019s huge."},"385":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, that's\u2026"},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"I can see that, again, even if you don't wanna\npitch something on television or you\u2019re"},"388":{"dur":4,"text":"not trying to get media, somebody who gets\nit who actually pays attention to the details,"},"393":{"dur":3,"text":"takes the time to add that personal connection\nto connect with someone where they\u2019re at,"},"397":{"dur":1,"text":"they do."},"398":{"dur":1,"text":"You\u2019ll remember them for a long time."},"399":{"dur":1,"text":"Ok, this is fantastic."},"400":{"dur":3,"text":"What is step number two to simplifying our\nmessage?"},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"Ok."},"404":{"dur":6,"text":"So step number two, I wanna encourage people\nto let go of insider jargon and really speak"},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"in words that everybody can understand."},"413":{"dur":5,"text":"It doesn't mean you don't know the insider\njargon, I just wanna encourage people to use"},"418":{"dur":1,"text":"words that everybody can understand."},"420":{"dur":5,"text":"So what happens is every industry has their\nown way of speaking."},"426":{"dur":4,"text":"This is more commonly an issue for people\nwho work in more technical fields, but every"},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"industry does have their own way of speaking."},"432":{"dur":2,"text":"So let\u2019s take doctors, for example."},"435":{"dur":3,"text":"Ok, so there\u2019s a big need for doctors on\nTV."},"438":{"dur":6,"text":"Let\u2019s say for example, somebody famous has\na brain aneurysm, God forbid."},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"Right?"},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"And a producer needs to find a doctor who\ncan explain it."},"448":{"dur":4,"text":"Ok, so that doctor is gonna get on the phone\nwith that producer and do what we call in"},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"the industry a pre interview."},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"That\u2019s basically the gateway to the opportunity."},"457":{"dur":3,"text":"You hit it out of the park, you have a good\nchance of ending up on TV."},"461":{"dur":1,"text":"You don\u2019t?"},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, then the producer moves on to somebody\nelse."},"464":{"dur":4,"text":"So that doctor has 2 choices, that doctor\ncan either speak about that aneurysm in a"},"469":{"dur":4,"text":"way that he would speak to, or she, he or\nshe, of course, would speak to their colleagues"},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"at a conference who all have same knowledge\nbase."},"477":{"dur":1,"text":"Or they can speak in everyday words."},"478":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, if you wanna be on TV, you need to be\nusing everyday words that are relatable, if"},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"possible visual cues."},"487":{"dur":7,"text":"You want to make even the most complicated\ntopic as simple as possible."},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"Really important."},"496":{"dur":1,"text":"This is\u2026 it\u2019s so important."},"497":{"dur":4,"text":"I will tell you, I\u2019ve even been in business\nmeetings where someone\u2019s talking to me and"},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"they start using words and I feel like a little\nkid in\u2026"},"504":{"dur":1,"text":"I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019ve gotta raise my hand."},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't know 5 things that you just said and\nI\u2019m lost.\u201d"},"508":{"dur":1,"text":"And even though I sound\u2026"},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"I\u2019m sometimes to myself sound a little silly,\nI won't let the conversation go on because"},"513":{"dur":1,"text":"I\u2019m already lost back there."},"514":{"dur":5,"text":"So, of course, for the media, this is so important\nand I think for many people, they just\u2026"},"519":{"dur":3,"text":"they\u2019re so used to their jargon but they\nalso wanna sound smart and sound intelligent,"},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"and we\u2019ve gotta dumb it down a little bit."},"526":{"dur":3,"text":"We\u2019ve gotta just break it down to a level\nthat everybody can understand."},"529":{"dur":4,"text":"And the thing is that breaking it down to\na level that everybody can understand is smart."},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"Because if you\u2019re not connecting with people\u2026"},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah, that was horrible."},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"I just said dumb it down, but it really is\nmaking it smarter."},"539":{"dur":1,"text":"Right."},"540":{"dur":4,"text":"But I think what you said is great because\na lot of people view it that way but, actually,"},"545":{"dur":4,"text":"the real\u2026 and people say that to me, \u201cI\u2019m\nworried I\u2019m gonna be dumbing down whatever"},"549":{"dur":3,"text":"I have to say,\u201d so I\u2019m actually really\nglad you said that."},"552":{"dur":4,"text":"The smartest thing you can do is make someone\nable to understand you."},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah."},"558":{"dur":1,"text":"And, ok, so let\u2019s\u2026"},"559":{"dur":4,"text":"I\u2019ve already explained how this can really\nhelp you with media, but what I find to be"},"564":{"dur":7,"text":"so fascinating is if you continue with the\ndoctor example, learning these skills serves"},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"you in your profession."},"573":{"dur":5,"text":"So I was working with this doctor last year,\ncoached him, he\u2019s an incredible doctor,"},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"he also took my course."},"579":{"dur":5,"text":"Within a month or so of working with me, he\nreally wanted to be implementing what we were"},"585":{"dur":6,"text":"doing and he was really a go getter, which\nI love, and he started changing the way that"},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"he approached his patients and his patients\u2019\nfamilies."},"596":{"dur":3,"text":"He started practicing what he was learning,\nmany of the things that we\u2019re talking about"},"599":{"dur":4,"text":"today about how to be successful with media\nand the way you communicate."},"604":{"dur":6,"text":"And what happened was within that month, he\nsoared to the top of his group in patient"},"610":{"dur":5,"text":"satisfaction scores because his patients were\nso much happier dealing with him."},"615":{"dur":5,"text":"And he actually felt that it made him a better\ndoctor, and that\u2019s across all professions."},"621":{"dur":4,"text":"So that, I\u2019m talking about doctors here,\nbut this could be anybody who is watching"},"626":{"dur":1,"text":"today."},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"It\u2019s not just doctors."},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"Does that make sense?"},"629":{"dur":1,"text":"Completely makes sense."},"630":{"dur":5,"text":"And I know even dealing with people whether\nthey\u2019re designers or programmers, they\u2019re"},"636":{"dur":3,"text":"people that work in film or television, when\nthe jargon starts coming out it\u2019s like I"},"639":{"dur":4,"text":"check out, I don't know if I can trust them,\nI don't know what the heck is going on, and"},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"I\u2019m like can you please speak in layman\u2019s\nterms?"},"646":{"dur":4,"text":"And as I\u2019m thinking as you\u2019re talking,\nalways the folks that treat me like, \u201cHey,"},"651":{"dur":1,"text":"I know this isn\u2019t your industry."},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"Let me explain it to you so that you can really\nget it so you can understand what we\u2019re"},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"doing,\u201d those are the people that I wind\nup hiring."},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"Absolutely."},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"And those are the people you wanna watch on\nTV and those are the people you wanna work"},"662":{"dur":1,"text":"with."},"663":{"dur":1,"text":"Absolutely."},"664":{"dur":6,"text":"The other thing is most people are not giving\nyou 100% of their attention whether they\u2019re"},"670":{"dur":4,"text":"watching you on TV or whether they\u2019re in\na meeting with you, quite frankly."},"674":{"dur":5,"text":"And so you wanna keep that in mind when you\u2019re\nexplaining, too, that you wanna keep things"},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"at a level where people can tune in and tune\nout a little bit."},"682":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah."},"683":{"dur":3,"text":"So next, point number three, is getting rid\nof extra details."},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"How do we do that?"},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"This is so common."},"690":{"dur":5,"text":"Every one of us has so many details that we\ncould share about any story, any message."},"696":{"dur":3,"text":"And so often people say to me, \u201cThere\u2019s\nso much I could be talking about."},"699":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't know what I should include, I don't\nknow where to start, I don't know what to"},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"leave out.\u201d"},"703":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, ok, you wanna start with something that\u2019s\ngonna reel people in and you know that because"},"708":{"dur":3,"text":"you\u2019ve done your research and you also know\nwhat\u2019s most promotable about you and you\u2019re"},"712":{"dur":1,"text":"gonna marry those."},"713":{"dur":4,"text":"And then you wanna include the details that\nstrategically forward whatever it is you\u2019re"},"718":{"dur":1,"text":"talking about."},"719":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, when you get towards the point where\nyou wanna finish up, you also wanna put a"},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"button on it, that\u2019s what I like to say."},"726":{"dur":3,"text":"So putting a button on it means you don't\njust end on a random detail."},"730":{"dur":5,"text":"You sort of circle back to your messaging\nto help tie it all together for people."},"735":{"dur":4,"text":"And when you do this, this is so important\nbecause when you start meandering to some"},"740":{"dur":5,"text":"other kind of detail that doesn't relate to\nthe topic that you\u2019re trying to convey,"},"745":{"dur":1,"text":"that\u2019s when you lose people."},"747":{"dur":3,"text":"Then people are confused, they don't really\nunderstand your messaging."},"750":{"dur":5,"text":"You\u2019ve gotta stay on point and think as\nyou\u2019re speaking, \u201cDoes this detail really"},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"pertain to what I\u2019m trying to convey?\u201d"},"758":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah."},"759":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is huge."},"760":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean, I know for me, it\u2019s been so interesting\nwhen someone asks me about what I do or, \u201cHow"},"765":{"dur":4,"text":"did you get started, Marie?\u201d and I\u2019m thinking\nexactly what you said in my head."},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"\u201cWell, how far do I go back?\u201d"},"771":{"dur":4,"text":"Because this is a big story and there\u2019s\na lot of twists and turns, so I completely"},"775":{"dur":1,"text":"relate to what most people think."},"776":{"dur":5,"text":"It\u2019s like what do I keep in the story and\nwhat do I let go of to keep it tight and right?"},"782":{"dur":4,"text":"And one of the things that I\u2019ve always done\nis think about how do I want to position myself"},"787":{"dur":1,"text":"in this particular instance?"},"788":{"dur":4,"text":"So, for example, if I wanna highlight the\nfact that I\u2019m a multipassionate entrepreneur,"},"793":{"dur":4,"text":"I will talk about my coaching practice and\nat the same time I started in dance and choreography"},"798":{"dur":1,"text":"and then I did this other thing."},"799":{"dur":1,"text":"So I\u2019ll highlight that."},"800":{"dur":4,"text":"If I want to highlight the fact that I learned\nabout internet marketing I\u2019ll talk about"},"804":{"dur":4,"text":"how I took an ebook from a little tiny PDF,\nwent through, self published it, and sold"},"809":{"dur":4,"text":"like 8 thousand copies and then took it to\na regular publisher and sold it in 13 languages."},"814":{"dur":6,"text":"I\u2019m always kind of selecting pieces of my\nstory based on A, like you said, what the"},"820":{"dur":3,"text":"media outlet is wanting me to talk about and,\nB, how I want to position myself."},"823":{"dur":1,"text":"Is that something\u2026?"},"824":{"dur":1,"text":"Absolutely."},"825":{"dur":4,"text":"So you\u2019re subconsciously doing, or maybe\nconsciously, doing point 1."},"829":{"dur":6,"text":"You\u2019re thinking about who am I talking to\nand how are they gonna relate to whatever"},"836":{"dur":4,"text":"it is in my story and how can I most successfully\nconnect with them?"},"841":{"dur":4,"text":"So when I\u2019m communicating myself and when\nI\u2019m coaching other people, whether that\u2019s"},"845":{"dur":5,"text":"one on one or in a group, however it is, there\u2019s\nconstantly a sensor, a ding, ding, ding that\u2019s"},"850":{"dur":1,"text":"going off in my head."},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"This point is moving us forward."},"854":{"dur":3,"text":"This point isn\u2019t moving us forward."},"858":{"dur":4,"text":"And you obviously wanna stay on the path of\nthis is moving us forward."},"862":{"dur":5,"text":"The second you start veering off, then people\ndon't know what to do with what you\u2019re saying."},"868":{"dur":2,"text":"And people wanna be able to follow you."},"870":{"dur":3,"text":"You wanna make it easy for people to follow\nyou."},"874":{"dur":4,"text":"You wanna serve up what they want authentically\non a silver platter for them."},"878":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah."},"879":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think your point about putting a button\non the end, something I was always kind of"},"884":{"dur":4,"text":"trained with especially from doing a lot of\nfitness videos, was telling people, \u201cHere\u2019s"},"888":{"dur":3,"text":"where we\u2019re going, this is the move we\u2019re\ngonna do,\u201d doing it, and say, \u201cThis is"},"891":{"dur":1,"text":"what you just worked out right now.\u201d"},"892":{"dur":4,"text":"So it was always that little coming back,\ncircling it up, making a bow, bing."},"896":{"dur":1,"text":"And it makes such a difference, right?"},"898":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah."},"899":{"dur":1,"text":"Really, really
