-- who's\ngoing to govern a town"},"305":{"dur":1,"text":"like Shaddadi afterwards."},"306":{"dur":2,"text":"It's primarily an Arab town,\nand we're working very"},"308":{"dur":3,"text":"closely to make sure that\nlocals are in control of"},"311":{"dur":1,"text":"that town once it's\ncleared of ISIL."},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"So that is still ongoing."},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"It will unfold over\nthe coming days."},"317":{"dur":2,"text":"So far, though, it's\ngoing fairly well."},"319":{"dur":1,"text":"Number four is Sinjar."},"320":{"dur":3,"text":"Sinjar was the main\nconnector between Raqqa"},"323":{"dur":1,"text":"and Mosul."},"324":{"dur":2,"text":"And Shaddadi is the last\npiece of cutting off this"},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"connection between Raqqa and\nMosul and making sure that"},"330":{"dur":1,"text":"they simply cannot travel\nthose roads anymore."},"332":{"dur":3,"text":"And so it's been\nSinjar, Shaddadi,"},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"cutting off the connection\nbetween Raqqa and Mosul."},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"Sinjar was for primarily\nKurdish Peshmerga fighters."},"341":{"dur":3,"text":"Sinjar is where ISIL really\nbroke onto the

of trade\nthem as slaves."},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"So what we're doing here\nis not only a military"},"365":{"dur":2,"text":"operation, it's kind of a\nmoral imperative to take"},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"these areas from ISIL."},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's one reason\nwe're so focused on it."},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"But Sinjar was very\nimportant because it cut off"},"373":{"dur":1,"text":"the main highway into Mosul."},"374":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'll get to Mosul."},"376":{"dur":2,"text":"Mosul, of course, everybody\nasks about -- when are we"},"378":{"dur":1,"text":"going to move on Mosul?"},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"We don't answer that\nquestion because we won't"},"381":{"dur":1,"text":"put a timeline on it."},"382":{"dur":1,"text":"But Mosul is\nalready started."},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"We're already working\nto constrict it."},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"We're pooling all of our\ninformation, intelligence,"},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"to basically learn\nmore about them."},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"Doing airstrikes into Mosul\nevery single night based on"},"393":{"dur":1,"text":"that -- upon that\nintelligence."},"394":{"dur":3,"text":"And again, most importantly,\nworking the local politics."},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm in constant touch\nwith our ambassador on the"},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"ground in Baghdad, with our\ndiplomats in the field"},"402":{"dur":1,"text":"up in Erbil."},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, again, taking\nthese kind of shards of wood"},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"together and turning them\ninto a baseball bat."},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"So what we've done for Mosul\n-- you'll see Makhmur on the"},"411":{"dur":2,"text":"map -- that's where we're\nsetting up a joint -- a"},"413":{"dur":3,"text":"headquarters, pooling all\nof these fighters that are"},"416":{"dur":1,"text":"going to fight ISIL."},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"It's Sunni tribes, it's\nlocal notables from Ninawa"},"421":{"dur":3,"text":"province, it's\nIraqi Peshmerga,"},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's the Iraqi army."},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"So in Munich last\nweek, for example,"},"428":{"dur":3,"text":"I saw both President Barzani\nof the Kurdistan region and"},"431":{"dur":3,"text":"Prime Minister Abadi to sit\ntogether to talk about how"},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"are we going to deal with\nMosul not only militarily,"},"437":{"dur":1,"text":"but also politically."},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"That is something\nwe're very focused on,"},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's actually coming\nalong fairly well."},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll skip to seven,\nbecause seven is Tikrit."},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"Tikrit, an iconic city in\nthe heart of Salah ad-Din"},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"province, it's where ISIL\nmoved into in the summer of"},"452":{"dur":3,"text":"2014 and totally depopulated\nthe city -- killed thousands"},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"of people in massacres\nthey put on YouTube."},"457":{"dur":1,"text":"It was retaken last year."},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"And then we\nfocused very hard,"},"461":{"dur":1,"text":"after the military\noperations,"},"462":{"dur":1,"text":"on what we call\nstabilization."},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"And that means returning\ninternally displaced people,"},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"getting them back\nto their homes,"},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"getting the lights back on."},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"Extremely, extremely\ndifficult to do,"},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"especially when we don't\nhave large numbers of forces"},"474":{"dur":1,"text":"on the ground to do this."},"476":{"dur":1,"text":"We're working\nthrough the U.N."},"477":{"dur":1,"text":"and through our\nlocal partners."},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"But Tikrit has been\na real success."},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"About 90 to 99 percent of\nthe people are now back in"},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"their homes."},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"And one reason of that is\nvery good cooperation from"},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"the Iraqi government and\nPrime Minister Abadi,"},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"and he's delegating a lot of\nauthority to the locals in"},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"these areas, so the governor\nof Salah ad-Din province and"},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"to local Sunni leaders in\nthese areas that kind of"},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"take charge."},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"And then through the\nGlobal Coalition,"},"498":{"dur":4,"text":"we have a stabilization fund\n-- about $80 million now --"},"502":{"dur":3,"text":"to fund these very\nquick-hit rapid projects."},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"So Tikrit was a\nproof of concept."},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"It actually worked\npretty well."},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"And now we're looking to do\nthe same thing in Ramadi,"},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"which is number\neight on the map."},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"Security operations in\nRamadi finished about a few"},"515":{"dur":1,"text":"weeks ago."},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"There are still\nsome things ongoing."},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"But now we're very focused\non the stabilization piece,"},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"trying to get people\nback into their homes,"},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"and most

Baghdad"},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"about 10 weeks ago -- I\ntalked to the governor who"},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"was just in Ramadi; every\nsecond or third home is"},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"wired with

has taken a global\nleadership role in this type"},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"of issue."},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"We'll be talking\nto them about that."},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's setting up the\nconditions for Ramadi to get"},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"the stabilization moving."},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"That's, again,\nalready started."},"558":{"dur":4,"text":"We have -- about 36\nelectricity

painstaking."},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"It requires the government\nof Baghdad to delegate"},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"authority to local leaders\nin Anbar province."},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's something we're\nworking with them on"},"577":{"dur":1,"text":"every single day."},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"So the Ramadi stabilization\npiece about what comes after"},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"ISIL is a
