when they were alive"},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"that they said straight off\nwhatever came into their heads."},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"But once you are in a\nbiography, all is different."},"547":{"dur":1,"text":"And so one of the things she wanted"},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"to do was to work out for\nherself why should being"},"551":{"dur":4,"text":"in a biography be so different\nfrom being in your life."},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"To which the answer, she felt is,"},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"that we can't account\nfor a life by a

Z,"},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"cradle to grave method."},"580":{"dur":4,"text":"So that was why I tried to,\nactually I was imitating"},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"what she said she did when she was working"},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"on Mrs. Dalloway."},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"She said she dug out deep pools,"},"591":{"dur":3,"text":"or caves behind her characters,\nso they would be

things."},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"So I try to do that."},"611":{"dur":3,"text":"I try to imitate my subject and dig out,"},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean not literally, because\nthat would be a mistake,"},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"but to dig out caves\nbehind the chronology."},"620":{"dur":1,"text":"That's what I was trying to do."},"622":{"dur":3,"text":"- You began as a literary critic."},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"You published extensively, and of course,"},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"this I think, is one of the reasons"},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"that your literary\nbiographies are so fine."},"631":{"dur":1,"text":"You're not afraid to make judgment"},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"and to look at the work."},"635":{"dur":4,"text":"You frequently talk about\nhow Woolf plays around"},"640":{"dur":3,"text":"with biography and biographical\ntechniques in her novels."},"643":{"dur":4,"text":"One of the statements you make,\nor maybe you're quoting her,"},"648":{"dur":0,"text":"I can't recall now."},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"But that I think you were\ntalking about Orlando,"},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"and you say that for her\nbiography, the revolution"},"655":{"dur":1,"text":"of biography was sexual?"},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"- Well I think that's\nprobably my paraphrase"},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"of her, but I think that\nwhenever she was thinking"},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"about life writing, as she\nherself called it, by the way,"},"664":{"dur":2,"text":"she was thinking about gender."},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"As for many feminist critics,\nand as for many of us,"},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"issues of gender and issues"},"674":{"dur":3,"text":"of genre are very closely intertwined."},"678":{"dur":4,"text":"And so she was puzzled as to\nwhy more women hadn't written"},"682":{"dur":1,"text":"their own life stories."},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"And she's thinking a\nlot about autobiography,"},"686":{"dur":1,"text":"as well as biography."},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"And she's constantly writing\nto her women friends,"},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"and saying, why don't you\nwrite your autobiography?"},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"Why haven't more women\nwritten, I mean she was"},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"partly drumming up books\nfor the Hogarth Press,"},"696":{"dur":4,"text":"but she says chastity and\nmodesty have a lot to answer for."},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"Why can't more women be like Russo?"},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"Why haven't more women spoken out"},"707":{"dur":1,"text":"about their sexual histories?"},"709":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, that goes alongside thinking"},"713":{"dur":3,"text":"there's a sort of public\nform, public convention"},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"of the novel, of the\nbiography, Freudian slip,"},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"which falls very strongly"},"721":{"dur":4,"text":"into a kind of male historical\ntradition or convention."},"728":{"dur":3,"text":"That is you're educated at\nschool, you go to public school,"},"732":{"dur":3,"text":"you go to, this is in England,\nin 19th, early 20th century,"},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"you go to university, you have a career,"},"737":{"dur":1,"text":"you get your honors, you get your titles,"},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"you have a grand old age."},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"That's the public scheme,\nwhich for many women,"},"743":{"dur":3,"text":"for women like her, who\ndidn't go to school,"},"747":{"dur":3,"text":"didn't go to university,\nwas not an available model."},"750":{"dur":4,"text":"So how do you change the model\nand make it more friendly,"},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"more sympathetic to women's lives."},"756":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's both autobiography and biography"},"758":{"dur":1,"text":"that she's thinking about\nvery much, as you say,"},"759":{"dur":1,"text":"in terms of gender."},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"- Do you think Strachey\nmust have influenced her,"},"766":{"dur":4,"text":"I should think, in breaking\nthrough the hagiography and..."},"771":{"dur":3,"text":"- She didn't entirely like his biography."},"774":{"dur":4,"text":"She wrote an essay in 1939\ncalled The Art of Biography."},"779":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think the word,\nart, is very interesting"},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"in relation, you still\nactually see newspaper pieces"},"784":{"dur":1,"text":"called the art of biography,\nyou never see newspaper pieces"},"786":{"dur":4,"text":"anymore called the art of\npoetry, or the art of the novel."},"790":{"dur":1,"text":"It's kind of dodo."},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"But the art of biography is\na phrase that stayed with us,"},"794":{"dur":2,"text":"but partly because, I\nthink, people are very,"},"797":{"dur":0,"text":"I mean we can maybe talk about this."},"798":{"dur":0,"text":"People are very ambivalent about"},"799":{"dur":3,"text":"how artful biography should be."},"802":{"dur":1,"text":"Now what Strachey wanted biography to do,"},"804":{"dur":2,"text":"and I don't, I'm sure\neveryone's here read the preface"},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"to Eminent Victorians,\nwhere he says he's going"},"809":{"dur":3,"text":"to attack the
