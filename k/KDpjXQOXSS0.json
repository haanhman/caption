clear."},"480":{"dur":4,"text":"But the reality was that the car in front\nof us came to a complete dead stop; not just"},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"slowed down, but just stopped right in the\nmiddle of

kind of boring."},"593":{"dur":3,"text":"And then we drove all the way up and all the\nway back, and the traffic was -- never went"},"597":{"dur":5,"text":"more than 55 miles per hour, even though the\nother cars were whizzing by us at times."},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"And most of the ride, I think my main reaction\nwas kind of boredom."},"605":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, it was like, \"OK, I get

whether"},"782":{"dur":6,"text":"that's a state, or a city, or a country -- to\ncreate the environment for large-scale testing,"},"788":{"dur":3,"text":"and then capital and technology, to walk into\nthat opportunity."},"791":{"dur":5,"text":"Because I think the benefits -- you know,\na million people get killed every year driving"},"797":{"dur":1,"text":"cars."},"798":{"dur":1,"text":"And 50 million people get injured driving\ncars."},"799":{"dur":4,"text":"The benefits, if you could make self-driving\ncars to reduce accidents, are so huge, that"},"804":{"dur":6,"text":"once the

point."},"813":{"dur":1,"text":"But it still requires technology."},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"It requires capital, which is easy."},"818":{"dur":4,"text":"And it requires policy, from a standpoint\nof creating the environment for testing."},"822":{"dur":6,"text":"SHINN: Jennifer, do you see a technical inflection\npoint before this sort of next fielded trial,"},"829":{"dur":2,"text":"or do you think all the pieces are there together?"},"831":{"dur":3,"text":"HEALEY: Well, I think there's going to have\nto be a cost inflection point."},"835":{"dur":1,"text":"And I know we have a slight disagreement about\nthat."},"836":{"dur":3,"text":"I wanted to say these maps that Google has\nare 3D LIDAR maps."},"840":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's 3D maps."},"841":{"dur":2,"text":"You're just doing it -- and they use GPS."},"843":{"dur":3,"text":"So you overlay it, and then you get a very,\nvery good view."},"847":{"dur":5,"text":"But, as you mentioned, snow, right, snow will\nchange the way the

won't get\nthat match."},"859":{"dur":4,"text":"So if you have a leaf, or if a paper bag blows\nin front of your LIDAR, it'll look like a"},"864":{"dur":1,"text":"wall just suddenly appeared."},"865":{"dur":4,"text":"And I'm sure the Google car doesn't stop short\nif it's going -- like they say, oh, it could"},"870":{"dur":4,"text":"be running at 160 miles an hour, except if\na paper bag flies in front of your face, and"},"874":{"dur":1,"text":"you have to stop at 160 miles an hour."},"876":{"dur":4,"text":"MUI: What it does is -- what it does, since\nit's watching three cars ahead, it knows that"},"880":{"dur":1,"text":"nobody else stopped for that paper bag."},"881":{"dur":1,"text":"So it can sort of assume that."},"883":{"dur":4,"text":"HEALEY: And that's going to get to my controversial\ntechnology point, which is this idea that"},"888":{"dur":2,"text":"you could have V to infrastructure, or V-to-V\ncommunication."},"890":{"dur":1,"text":"SHINN: \"V\" being..."},"891":{"dur":1,"text":"HEALEY: Oh, I'm sorry."},"893":{"dur":1,"text":"Vehicle, sorry."},"894":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm so deep in the world -- so, yes."},"896":{"dur":2,"text":"So we just rattle these acronyms off."},"898":{"dur":3,"text":"So vehicle-to-vehicle communication, or vehicle-to-infrastructure\ncommunication."},"902":{"dur":4,"text":"And although LIDAR is a fabulous technology,\nit can't see ahead forever."},"907":{"dur":1,"text":"It has limitations."},"908":{"dur":6,"text":"But information from forever-ahead can be\ntransmitted back to the car, you know, if"},"915":{"dur":3,"text":"it went through the cloud, if it went through\nroadside infrastructure, if it -- through"},"918":{"dur":1,"text":"an intelligent gateway."},"919":{"dur":3,"text":"Or if a cars actually were all on the same\nfrequency, they could talk to each other and"},"922":{"dur":2,"text":"say, \"Watch out for the paper bag,\" or -- you\nknow."},"925":{"dur":3,"text":"Or you could do communication with the car\nahead of you and sort of do platooning, and"},"929":{"dur":4,"text":"you wouldn't -- you would take that as evidence\nversus, you know, the paper-bag blockade."},"934":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's intelligent sensor fusion between\ndifferent modes."},"937":{"dur":5,"text":"SHINN: How important do you think this kind\nof network effect, automating not just one"},"942":{"dur":3,"text":"vehicle, but multiple vehicles in the traffic\npattern, so they can talk to each other?"},"946":{"dur":3,"text":"How important do you think that is in the\ninflection point?"},"949":{"dur":4,"text":"HEALEY: See, I think it's pretty important,\nbecause I think it's going to allow more coordinated"},"954":{"dur":6,"text":"action between both autonomous vehicles, semi-autonomous\nvehicles, and human-driven vehicles, so that"},"960":{"dur":4,"text":"you'll have information about -- people could\ncommunicate information about their plans."},"964":{"dur":3,"text":"And the autonomous vehicles, aside from knowing\npeople's blind spots, might be able to know"},"968":{"dur":1,"text":"their intentions, too."},"970":{"dur":3,"text":"MUI: And some people believe it's irrelevant."},"974":{"dur":4,"text":"Because if you require a vehicle to vehicle\ncommunication, you'll never get there, right,"},"979":{"dur":5,"text":"because if you need to have all the cars talking\nto each other in order to make this work,"},"985":{"dur":1,"text":"the cars will never all talk to one another."},"986":{"dur":4,"text":"So if you get to a point where you have no\nbenefits until they all talk to one another"},"991":{"dur":3,"text":"-- so I'm not arguing that you might not need\nit."},"994":{"dur":2,"text":"But what I'm saying is if you need it, we'll\nnever see this stuff."},"996":{"dur":3,"text":"BRYNJOLFSSON: Well, there's a tradeoff between\nneed and benefit from it."},"999":{"dur":6,"text":"So what I see is that it's not a black or\nwhite thing that, you know, on such-and-such"},"1006":{"dur":4,"text":"day, 2022, we're going to have autonomous\ncars."},"1010":{"dur":2,"text":"It's going to be a much more gradual adoption."},"1013":{"dur":3,"text":"That's one of the things I got to appreciate\nfrom riding it, and talking to someone like"},"1016":{"dur":3,"text":"my colleagues, who were much more into the\ntechnology."},"1019":{"dur":5,"text":"John Leonard at MIT has come up with this\nfive-phase -- five levels of

debate about how much\ntime you need to have for warning before you"},"1057":{"dur":1,"text":"do that switchover."},"1058":{"dur":3,"text":"The highest level, though, is complete autonomy,\nwhere you maybe don't have a human at all."},"1062":{"dur":4,"text":"You say -- you tell the car, \"Go pick up a\npizza for me,\" or, \"Bring my child to

think is much, much harder."},"1077":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not like a little bit harder."},"1078":{"dur":6,"text":"It becomes a real leap when you go from, say,\n95 or 99 percent autonomous, that last 1 percent"},"1085":{"dur":1,"text":"is very, very difficult."},"1086":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're going to have, I think, an adoption\nof a lot of things."},"1089":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, those of you

quickly."},"1143":{"dur":6,"text":"SHINN: That's a good segue, actually, to a\npoint that Chunka has researched quite a bit,"},"1150":{"dur":3,"text":"has written about, which is who wins and
