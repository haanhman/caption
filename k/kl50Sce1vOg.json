me explain what Nabal has done"},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"to get so much wealth."},"524":{"dur":4,"text":"Nabal has been taking advantage\nof smaller landowners."},"528":{"dur":3,"text":"He has been making loans\nto these smaller landowners"},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"so that they could increase their animals"},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"and then hopefully increase their

owners."},"558":{"dur":4,"text":"And when you would bankrupt\nsomeone, Nabal would then go in"},"562":{"dur":4,"text":"and take all of their\nanimals, most of their land,"},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"maybe even enslave some\nof their family members"},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"or enslave the smaller\nbusiness owner himself."},"572":{"dur":4,"text":"So you can see, Nabal was very\ncruel, he was very shrewd."},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"He was mean and surly in his dealings."},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"Then we have Abigail."},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"Now Abigail is a beautiful\nand intelligent woman"},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"who unfortunately is married to Nabal."},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is her reality."},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"She lives with Dude-is-rude, okay?"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can just think of it that way."},"596":{"dur":0,"text":"So think of her life."},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"She wakes up everyday\nnext to Dude-is-rude."},"599":{"dur":4,"text":"She smells the stinky\nbreath of Dude-is-rude."},"604":{"dur":1,"text":"She does life with Dude-is-rude"},"606":{"dur":1,"text":"and she goes to bed every\nnight with Dude-is-rude."},"607":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is one of the\nburdens in Abigail's life."},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"But she also has a blessing"},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"because her husband has financial means"},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"so therefore she has financial means."},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"So she has a burden, she has a blessing,"},"619":{"dur":3,"text":"and then she also has quite\na bit of busyness in her life"},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"because it's about to be festive time."},"626":{"dur":3,"text":"Now you know, since it's\nabout to be festive time,"},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"that the girl has been on Pinterest."},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"And so she has,\n(audience laughs)"},"634":{"dur":1,"text":"she has her list because she's found"},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"all kinds of new

shouts)"},"645":{"dur":1,"text":"What is it?"},"647":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay, whatever that is."},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, so.\n(audience laughs)"},"651":{"dur":1,"text":"So she's got her grocery store list."},"652":{"dur":1,"text":"So she's got all the lists."},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's some realities\nabout Abigail's life"},"657":{"dur":1,"text":"that we can relate to."},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"She has certain burdens about her life,"},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"she has certain blessings about her life,"},"663":{"dur":1,"text":"she has busyness about her life."},"664":{"dur":2,"text":"So we can all sort of relate to Abigail."},"667":{"dur":4,"text":"She's just doing her thing in\nthe middle of everyday life."},"671":{"dur":3,"text":"And let me assure you, Abigail had no idea"},"677":{"dur":3,"text":"that she would be included\nin God's holy word."},"680":{"dur":4,"text":"Abigail had no idea that there\nwas anything about her life"},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"that was anything but ordinary."},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"Abigail had no idea that\nthousands of years later,"},"689":{"dur":3,"text":"we would be sitting here\nstudying about what she has done."},"693":{"dur":3,"text":"She was just living an ordinary life"},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"full of ordinary stuff just like we face."},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"Burdens, blessings, busyness."},"702":{"dur":4,"text":"And yet, there was something\nabout Abigail's heart"},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"that God took note of"},"708":{"dur":3,"text":"and is about to use her in a mighty way."},"711":{"dur":4,"text":"News flash, you are probably\nliving a pretty ordinary life."},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"And you are probably unaware"},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"of how much God desires to use you."},"725":{"dur":3,"text":"And how crucial it is\nthat you don't get stuck"},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"just focused on the burdens of your life."},"731":{"dur":1,"text":"That you don't get so distracted"},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"by the busyness of your life."},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"That you don't get so enamored"},"737":{"dur":1,"text":"with the blessings of your life"},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"that you forget your ultimate job"},"741":{"dur":4,"text":"is to be obedient to God in\nthe midst of everyday life"},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"and allow God to do everything else."},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"And trust me, you don't\nhave to feel extraordinary"},"755":{"dur":2,"text":"to be in the process of being used"},"758":{"dur":3,"text":"in an extraordinary way by God."},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"Abigail, I promise you,"},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"she did not feel extraordinary at all."},"765":{"dur":1,"text":"If she came into this conference,"},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"she'd be sitting in an ordinary seat"},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"in the middle of an ordinary day"},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"thinking her life was quite ordinary."},"773":{"dur":3,"text":"And yet, look at what God is about to do."},"776":{"dur":3,"text":"And the same is true for each one of us."},"779":{"dur":1,"text":"You do not have to have a platform."},"781":{"dur":1,"text":"You do not have to have a microphone."},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"Abigail had none of those things."},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"She just had an ordinary life"},"787":{"dur":3,"text":"and an extraordinary\nrelationship with God."},"793":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay, so that's Abigail."},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"Then we have David."},"796":{"dur":4,"text":"Now David is a little bit\nof a interesting character,"},"800":{"dur":2,"text":"an interesting man in the Old Testament"},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"because he is going to be used by God"},"805":{"dur":1,"text":"also in an extraordinary way"},"807":{"dur":3,"text":"but he is given a platform\nin a really big way."},"811":{"dur":2,"text":"However, when we encounter David here,"},"813":{"dur":3,"text":"he's in a very difficult spot in his life."},"817":{"dur":4,"text":"You see, David has been\nanointed to be the future king"},"822":{"dur":3,"text":"but he has not yet been\nappointed to take the throne."},"826":{"dur":2,"text":"So the problem that David is having here"},"828":{"dur":4,"text":"is that God has said, I'm gonna\nuse you in a really big way."},"833":{"dur":4,"text":"However, currently, we\nfind David hiding in caves"},"837":{"dur":3,"text":"and doing odd jobs just\nto try to make ends meet."},"841":{"dur":2,"text":"And he's surrounded by some men"},"844":{"dur":2,"text":"who have chosen to follow him."},"846":{"dur":2,"text":"So you would think, oh, well\nat least in this hard place"},"848":{"dur":3,"text":"of his life, at least\nhe is seen as a leader."},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"But if you look at First Samuel chapter 22"},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"verses one and two, you\nfind a little description"},"857":{"dur":2,"text":"of the men who are following David."},"859":{"dur":3,"text":"It says all those who\nare in distress, in debt,"},"862":{"dur":2,"text":"and discontented gathered around David"},"865":{"dur":1,"text":"and he became their leader."},"866":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, wow.\n(audience laughs)"},"870":{"dur":3,"text":"That sounds like a really\ncharming group of people to lead."},"874":{"dur":1,"text":"Do you want to know who these men are"},"875":{"dur":1,"text":"that have gathered around David"},"877":{"dur":1,"text":"who are also hiding in caves,"},"878":{"dur":3,"text":"who are also in debt, in\ndistress and discontented?"},"882":{"dur":2,"text":"It's these men, these smaller landowners,"},"884":{"dur":1,"text":"these smaller business owners"},"886":{"dur":4,"text":"that have been so wronged\nby men like Nabal."},"890":{"dur":1,"text":"And they are not in a good place."},"892":{"dur":3,"text":"They're in a very difficult\nplace, as is David."},"896":{"dur":3,"text":"And if we look at First Samuel chapter 16,"},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"and if you want to just\nmake a few left-hand turns"},"901":{"dur":4,"text":"over to First Samuel chapter\n16, I'm gonna give you"},"905":{"dur":2,"text":"just a tiny bit of\nhistory about David's life"},"908":{"dur":3,"text":"because I really want you to understand"},"911":{"dur":4,"text":"how deeply I believe David\nis infected by rejection"},"917":{"dur":3,"text":"that happened so long ago in his life."},"921":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, in First Samuel chapter 16,"},"924":{"dur":3,"text":"we find the prophet\nSamuel has now been sent"},"927":{"dur":3,"text":"to the house of Jesse\nto anoint a new king."},"931":{"dur":1,"text":"The existing king, Saul,"},"933":{"dur":2,"text":"his heart has turned away from the Lord."},"935":{"dur":1,"text":"His heart has been hardened."},"936":{"dur":3,"text":"God is going to not let\nSaul be king forever"},"940":{"dur":2,"text":"and so God tells Samuel the prophet"},"942":{"dur":1,"text":"to go and anoint a new king."},"944":{"dur":3,"text":"So Samuel goes to the house\nof Jesse and says to Jesse,"},"948":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Go bring in all of your sons,"},"950":{"dur":2,"text":"\"I want to have a meeting with you.\""},"952":{"dur":1,"text":"Now this would be one\nof the biggest events"},"954":{"dur":2,"text":"in the house of Jesse ever."},"956":{"dur":4,"text":"So Jesse does pretty\nmuch do what Samuel says,"},"960":{"dur":2,"text":"with one exception."},"963":{"dur":3,"text":"Jesse goes and gets all of his sons"},"966":{"dur":1,"text":"and because it's such a big deal"},"967":{"dur":1,"text":"that the prophet is coming to their house,"},"969":{"dur":1,"text":"this would be like the\nPresident of the United States"},"971":{"dur":1,"text":"coming to your house today."},"972":{"dur":2,"text":"And you know you would\nbe scolding your children"},"975":{"dur":1,"text":"up one side and down the other."},"976":{"dur":1,"text":"This would be one of those rare times"},"978":{"dur":2,"text":"that they all bathed at the same time."},"980":{"dur":3,"text":"You have their hair combed,\nyou know, you have them all,"},"984":{"dur":2,"text":"hey, when was the last time\nyou brushed your teeth?"},"986":{"dur":3,"text":"Guess what, today isn't\ngonna be that day, okay?"},"989":{"dur":1,"text":"So you're gonna make sure\nthat they all look nice"},"991":{"dur":1,"text":"and I'm sure that Jesse did that"},"993":{"dur":2,"text":"and he brings in all of his sons"},"995":{"dur":4,"text":"but he leaves David out in\nthe field tending the sheep."},"1000":{"dur":1,"text":"And I have no idea,"},"1001":{"dur":3,"text":"because we don't have\nany clue in the text,"},"1004":{"dur":3,"text":"why did he leave David out in\nthe field to tend the sheep"},"1008":{"dur":2,"text":"except for the fact that maybe,"},"1010":{"dur":4,"text":"maybe Jesse the father\nthought, yeah, I
