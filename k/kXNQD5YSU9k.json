fully\ninvolved in our discussions with the local\nauthority."},"2229":{"dur":1,"text":"Sorry what was the other question?"},"2231":{"dur":3,"text":">> To what extent the absence of a\nregistered manager was an explanation"},"2234":{"dur":1,"text":"for what you found?"},"2236":{"dur":4,"text":">> I don't think it's a full explanation but\ncertainly part of it, we're seeing a pattern"},"2241":{"dur":5,"text":"where there is no registered manager it\ncan be very difficult for the quality of the"},"2246":{"dur":3,"text":"service to be monitored properly, for\nthem to be held accountable for the"},"2250":{"dur":4,"text":"quality monitoring, in this case the\nprovider was doing it from a distance"},"2255":{"dur":2,"text":"and actually wasn't doing anything."},"2258":{"dur":4,"text":"And the manager onsite was doing\nsome of their own monitoring, but there"},"2262":{"dur":5,"text":"was no requirement for them to\nreport on issues or pick things up."},"2268":{"dur":4,"text":"So certainly our experience is that where\nthere's no registered manager there is a"},"2273":{"dur":1,"text":"drop off in quality."},"2274":{"dur":5,"text":"And that might link why this service\nhas deteriorated in the absence of a\nmanager."},"2281":{"dur":2,"text":">> If I can just pick up the point about\nthe involvement of the families this is"},"2284":{"dur":5,"text":"one of the things I think we really need\nto look at in our debrief with the local"},"2289":{"dur":2,"text":"authority and the Clinical\nCommissioning Group, because I think"},"2292":{"dur":5,"text":"there were lots of us involved in having\nthose conversations and some of that I"},"2297":{"dur":6,"text":"think potentially got very confusing\nfor people, and

the\nconversations that we all had."},"2369":{"dur":6,"text":">> Thank you, it's good to hear a bit\nmore background and information as to\nwhat happened."},"2376":{"dur":4,"text":"I think we ought to

I think we need to recognise that."},"2388":{"dur":7,"text":"Three things I wanted to say, even if\nour previous inspection didn't get fully"},"2396":{"dur":6,"text":"underneath the issues,

that that can happen\nactually, things can change very quickly."},"2415":{"dur":4,"text":"And so there's no room for\ncomplacency, I think that's particularly"},"2419":{"dur":6,"text":"the case where

because things\ncan change very quickly."},"2438":{"dur":4,"text":"The second point was about the\nprovider, the nurse, we had a question"},"2443":{"dur":5,"text":"about whether we'd know if this person\ntried to open up somewhere else which"},"2449":{"dur":6,"text":"is good, but it seems to me if this person\nis a nurse we ought to pursue that,"},"2455":{"dur":4,"text":"I don't know if they are registered or\nused to be, but if they allowed this to"},"2460":{"dur":5,"text":"happen, this scale, we ought to be\nlooking at that in more detail shall we\nsay."},"2467":{"dur":5,"text":"And the
