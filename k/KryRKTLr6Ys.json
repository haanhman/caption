Lesson?"},"5":{"dur":0,"text":"Cloning"},"7":{"dur":3,"text":"Subtitles by:  \u2665 Neko Chococat \u2665"},"12":{"dur":3,"text":"Cloning a plant, this geranium for example, is pretty easy"},"15":{"dur":2,"text":"All you need to do is make a cut and chop part of it off."},"18":{"dur":2,"text":"You might need to dip the end of this in some plant hormones"},"21":{"dur":2,"text":"Some rooting powder which contains auxin"},"23":{"dur":1,"text":"And that will start the roots growing"},"25":{"dur":3,"text":"You need to leave it in some water to allow the roots to grow"},"28":{"dur":2,"text":"And the cutting will grow into a plant"},"31":{"dur":3,"text":"Which is genetically identical to your original plant"},"34":{"dur":1,"text":"It's DNA is exactly the same"},"36":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's really, really easy to clone plants."},"38":{"dur":2,"text":"We can reproduce different species of plant that way"},"42":{"dur":2,"text":"Really, really incredibly easily, and have done throughout history"},"45":{"dur":1,"text":"Cloning an animal,"},"47":{"dur":0,"text":"On the other hand"},"48":{"dur":2,"text":"Is considerably more difficult because you can't just,"},"50":{"dur":1,"text":"Chop a limb off an animal"},"52":{"dur":2,"text":"Stick it in some hormones, and wait for the whole animal to grow again."},"55":{"dur":1,"text":"Animals are much more complex"},"57":{"dur":2,"text":"So the process for cloning an animal is a little bit more difficult"},"60":{"dur":1,"text":"Let me run through that and I'll show you"},"62":{"dur":3,"text":"Remember the nucleus of every cell contains a complete copy"},"66":{"dur":1,"text":"Of that organisms DNA"},"68":{"dur":1,"text":"So the nucleus of this one animal cell"},"70":{"dur":3,"text":"Contains all the DNA necessary to make a copy of this animal,"},"73":{"dur":0,"text":"A clone"},"76":{"dur":3,"text":"We very carefully remove the nucleus from the animal cell"},"79":{"dur":2,"text":"And then we're going to need an unfertilised egg cell"},"82":{"dur":2,"text":"Taken from a female of the same species of animal"},"85":{"dur":3,"text":"We remove the nucleus of the unfertilised egg cell"},"88":{"dur":0,"text":"And discard that"},"89":{"dur":1,"text":"And then we introduce the nucleus"},"91":{"dur":2,"text":"From the cell of the animal which we want to clone"},"94":{"dur":1,"text":"The unfertilised egg cell"},"95":{"dur":2,"text":"Now contains a complete copy of the DNA"},"98":{"dur":1,"text":"Of the animal which we want to clone."},"101":{"dur":2,"text":"A small electrical current is then applied"},"103":{"dur":4,"text":"This starts the egg cell dividing, just like a normally fertilized egg cell"},"107":{"dur":2,"text":"And that egg cell will then steadily develop"},"110":{"dur":2,"text":"Into an embryo, and then a fetus,"},"112":{"dur":3,"text":"Which is genetically identical to the animal we're trying to clone."},"115":{"dur":2,"text":"The embryo is implanted into the uterus of a surrogate mother,"},"118":{"dur":1,"text":"And after the gestation period is over"},"120":{"dur":1,"text":"The clone of the animal is born"},"122":{"dur":3,"text":"This clone is, in genetic terms, an identical twin"},"125":{"dur":1,"text":"It's DNA is exactly the same"},"128":{"dur":2,"text":"Because it was born at a different time,"},"130":{"dur":1,"text":"From a different uterus,"},"132":{"dur":2,"text":"It can actually be a completely different age"},"134":{"dur":1,"text":"Remember, any cell with a nucleus,"},"136":{"dur":2,"text":"can potentially be cloned into an entire animal"},"139":{"dur":2,"text":"Lots of species of animal have now been cloned in this way,"},"142":{"dur":2,"text":"Which raises an obvious question"},"144":{"dur":1,"text":"Could we use it to clone a human being?"},"146":{"dur":1,"text":"\ud835\ude38\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude2d, \ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude2f
