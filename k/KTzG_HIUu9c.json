steps that happened?"},"177":{"dur":6,"text":"And what we\u00edve been doing since the sort of the mid 80\u00eds is what I call digitizing biology."},"185":{"dur":7,"text":"As we read the genetic

fashion."},"377":{"dur":8,"text":"But looking at my two sets of chromosomes from my parents, they actually differed from each other by about .5%"},"386":{"dur":6,"text":"which was much higher than all the announcements in 2000, how we differed out one letter out of genetic code from each other."},"393":{"dur":3,"text":"People just looked at homologous regions, looked at SNIPs,"},"396":{"dur":5,"text":"the single base pair changes and so we only differ by 1 out of a thousand."},"403":{"dur":4,"text":"When you try to compare any two of us, we\u00edre comparing four

the single letter changes."},"416":{"dur":5,"text":"In fact there\u00eds more rearrangements and changes in the genome, more base pairs involved, in structural

be key."},"472":{"dur":5,"text":"When you\u00edre looking at 44% variation with as many of,"},"478":{"dur":4,"text":"you know, millions of changes, there\u00eds an awful lot to look at."},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"Genomics has expanded very rapidly in the last few years."},"487":{"dur":7,"text":"Due to technological innovations, \n so what was a $5 billion government worldwide program,"},"495":{"dur":3,"text":"that we forced to go a little bit faster,"},"499":{"dur":3,"text":"now you can buy a machine about the size of this podium for a half a million"},"502":{"dur":6,"text":"dollars and sequence a genome in one or two days and that cost has going down substantially."},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"So genomes are pouring into the databases from around the world,"},"514":{"dur":5,"text":"so looking at that 1 to 3% difference, so here\u00eds looking at a Han Chinese,"},"520":{"dur":7,"text":"Gubi, one of the recent sequence people from Africa

myself and the Chinese individual."},"551":{"dur":6,"text":"We all evolved out of these populations in Africa so it\u00eds not surprising there\u00eds more variation there."},"558":{"dur":7,"text":"But it\u00eds sort of turning people\u00eds thinking on its head. So, if you think about in your field,"},"566":{"dur":8,"text":"some of the reading I\u00edve done and tried to follow over time, NASA\u00eds been doing genetic selection for a long time."},"574":{"dur":5,"text":"You just didn\u00edt call it that, because that seem to have a bad connotation"},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"but people had to pass rigorous tests, they had to be certain sizes."},"584":{"dur":5,"text":"These are phenotypic selections. So why not get smart and actually really do it"},"590":{"dur":5,"text":"and screen for the things that might be meaningful for allowing space flight?"},"596":{"dur":9,"text":"The study is showing that some inner ear changes allow people to totally escape the effects of disorientation in space,"},"606":{"dur":7,"text":"things associated with bone regeneration, DNA repair from radiation and on and on."},"614":{"dur":9,"text":"That, probably this list could be thousands of traits long. All biology works on selection, NASA\u00eds worked on selection,"},"624":{"dur":7,"text":"measure a few more parameters and what you\u00edve been measuring and you probably can get a better result."},"633":{"dur":5,"text":"If we\u00edre going to have people travelling for their whole lives and even multiple generations,"},"638":{"dur":5,"text":"we might want to think about engineering these and other traits to enable those purposes."},"646":{"dur":5,"text":"But we\u00edre not alone even in our own bodies, we actually have more microbes than human cells."},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"So we have roughly a hundred trillion human cells,"},"654":{"dur":4,"text":"each of you have about 200 trillion of bacteria associated with you right now."},"660":{"dur":1,"text":"Nothing personal."},"662":{"dur":1,"text":"[Laugh]"},"663":{"dur":1,"text":"But they can get very personal."},"665":{"dur":6,"text":"So we\u00edre actually born without these microorganisms and we acquire them quite quickly"},"672":{"dur":7,"text":"and the gene population exceeds our own gene population by orders and magnitude."},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"So think about right now, maybe the person next to you,"},"683":{"dur":5,"text":"especially if they\u00edre coughing have about a thousand different bacteria in their mouths right now."},"689":{"dur":7,"text":"If you look at, we\u00edre talking about maybe 10 million genes in the microbes associated with each one of us."},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"We don\u00edt really know what most of these do."},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"There\u00eds new studies now just coming out of it,"},"702":{"dur":5,"text":"these were discovered using the tools we developed for \n sequence in the human genome, the shotgun sequencing."},"708":{"dur":6,"text":"So we can just take samples from different body cavities and sequence at once all the microbes that are there."},"715":{"dur":4,"text":"This should have been being done by NASA for years now."},"721":{"dur":4,"text":"Each new person that goes up in the space station is bringing"},"725":{"dur":5,"text":"perhaps 10 million new genes, organisms, pathogens with them on that trip."},"732":{"dur":3,"text":"We\u00edve been doing environmental sequencing as I\u00edll show you in a minute"},"736":{"dur":1,"text":"and some environments such as submarines and others,"},"738":{"dur":6,"text":"and certainly I\u00edm sure the space station create a very unique microbial habitats."},"745":{"dur":4,"text":"So to understand our biology, we have to understand our own genetic code,"},"750":{"dur":4,"text":"we have to understand the genetic code and the extent of these microbes associated with us."},"755":{"dur":5,"text":"We have to understand the interactions with our immune system and then with the external environment."},"761":{"dur":8,"text":"So it\u00eds getting more complicated by the minute but the exciting thing for me is now we know what the parameters are,"},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"at least we think we do."},"771":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think for the first time we actually have a chance of making some progress."},"776":{"dur":2,"text":"Instead of being ignorant that all these things exist,"},"779":{"dur":3,"text":"we can know about them and even manipulate them and understand them."},"784":{"dur":4,"text":"Here\u00eds the change in different cancers since 1975."},"789":{"dur":3,"text":"Esophageal cancer is the fastest growing one."},"793":{"dur":6,"text":"And if we look at the microbiome in these individuals with the esophageal cancer,"},"799":{"dur":5,"text":"they have a whole unique microbiota associated with them."},"805":{"dur":4,"text":"Now we don\u00edt know yet is that causal or is that the result of the cancer?"},"810":{"dur":5,"text":"It becomes important to determine, but obviously esophageal cancer people think is"},"815":{"dur":5,"text":"clearly environmentally determined and these microbes are key part of that environment."},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"So what else does this microbiome do?"},"825":{"dur":6,"text":"When we look at physiology, our biochemistry only allows certain things to be made,"},"832":{"dur":7,"text":"our microbes provide a lot of that additional physiology so what is that microbial potential?"},"840":{"dur":6,"text":"So if we have 20,000 somewhat genes, maybe you can get a hundred thousand different transcripts,"},"846":{"dur":5,"text":"maybe 100,000 to 300,000 different proteins depending on splice variants etcetera,"},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"but the best quantitation of our chemistry is"},"856":{"dur":6,"text":"roughly 2,400 different chemical compounds that we can make enzymatically from our gene set."},"863":{"dur":1,"text":"So what happens with those?"},"865":{"dur":4,"text":"So if we\u00edre to measure your blood stream after a meal,"},"870":{"dur":5,"text":"we find around 500 different chemicals circulating in your blood stream."},"875":{"dur":3,"text":"Only 60% of those are from human metabolism."},"879":{"dur":6,"text":"30% or so are derived from all those different species you eat during your meal."},"886":{"dur":7,"text":"But 10% or on the order of 50 chemicals perhaps circulating \n in your blood stream right now are bacterial metabolites."},"894":{"dur":4,"text":"We have no idea what role they play in human physiology; do they make you feel better?"},"899":{"dur":1,"text":"Do they protect you from disease?"},"901":{"dur":0,"text":"Do they cause disease?"},"902":{"dur":2,"text":"Do they make you depressed?"},"904":{"dur":4,"text":"All the above, any of those things, nobody has any idea."},"908":{"dur":6,"text":"We just know they\u00edre there now, and they can be readily measured so we need to measure the genetic code,"},"915":{"dur":1,"text":"we need to measure our microbes,"},"916":{"dur":5,"text":"and we need to know all these different chemicals circulating in our blood in different environments."},"922":{"dur":9,"text":"This would be great studies to do just on an existing space trips now, let alone try to understand for longer ones."},"932":{"dur":8,"text":"So for using our imaginations and I was asked to do that, \n why not come up with a synthetic microbiome?"},"941":{"dur":5,"text":"If we had a way with antibiotics or a way to sterilize an astronaut"},"947":{"dur":7,"text":"before going into space and providing them with a synthetically compiled community."},"955":{"dur":7,"text":"We could eliminate completely disease organisms; maybe have no dental decay for example."},"962":{"dur":8,"text":"From reading \u00ecPacking for Mars\u00ee, I understand methanogens and \n sulphur producers are a major problem in space flight,"},"972":{"dur":4,"text":"except for those who want to propel themselves around the cabin."},"976":{"dur":2,"text":"[Laugh]"},"979":{"dur":2,"text":"But I understand the physics of that doesn\u00edt really work."},"982":{"dur":5,"text":"Body odor is primarily caused by microbes."},"987":{"dur":3,"text":"The French have tried to cover up things with perfume but the best way"},"992":{"dur":7,"text":"to eliminate smell from your armpits or other areas is to kill the microbes."},"999":{"dur":5,"text":"So if you use something like the 70% alcohol, you can totally eliminate some of those odors."},"1005":{"dur":3,"text":"So, if we come up with the right set of microbes,"},"1009":{"dur":6,"text":"we can eliminate some of these perhaps olfactory and even health problems."},"1016":{"dur":6,"text":"Why not add bac-cells that make specific nutrients or vitamins instead of having to get those from the diet."},"1024":{"dur":4,"text":"Unique metabolisms, so for example if we were making an algae based food,"},"1029":{"dur":3,"text":"we could metabolize every part of that algae with"},"1032":{"dur":5,"text":"cellulose degradation to sugars perhaps retaining calcium better, etcetera."},"1038":{"dur":7,"text":"So I\u00edm sure many of you come up with far better advantages than I can with the controlled environment."},"1046":{"dur":7,"text":"So if we look at environments, based Carl Woese, who started measuring 16 sRNA,"},"1054":{"dur":4,"text":"our view of the world expanded dramatically."},"1058":{"dur":6,"text":"But it turns out even the 16 sRNA was missing things by over an order of magnitude"},"1064":{"dur":2,"text":"and just from simple experiments in my spaceship,"},"1067":{"dur":9,"text":"it\u00eds a 95 foot spaceship that we\u00edve sailed around the world taking samples every 200 miles in diverse environments."},"1077":{"dur":1,"text":"We\u00edve come up with a very different view."},"1079":{"dur":6,"text":"We just finished sampling in the Baltic and the Mediterranean and Black Seas this last summer."},"1086":{"dur":4,"text":"We just simply filter sea water, collect different levels of microorganisms,"},"1091":{"dur":2,"text":"then sequence everything that\u00eds on the filters."},"1093":{"dur":3,"text":"We don\u00edt even see the organisms; we don\u00edt know what they look like."},"1097":{"dur":6,"text":"We know what their genomes look like from compiling all their genetic data."},"1103":{"dur":3,"text":"So it\u00eds a simple apparatus, we have a different one for sampling an air."},"1107":{"dur":7,"text":"We\u00edve been doing the air genome and looking in all kinds of diverse environments."},"1115":{"dur":5,"text":"These are complex plots but basically what you\u00edd expect if there was limited diversity"},"1121":{"dur":9,"text":"when we first sampled in the Sargasso Sea in early 2001 through 2003, we were told we\u00edd only find a few microbes."},"1131":{"dur":5,"text":"So what we can do is put a genome sequence across the top of this and then compare things,"},"1137":{"dur":5,"text":"each one of these little bars is roughly 600 base pairs of DNA sequence."},"1143":{"dur":7,"text":"So, if there was a simple set of organisms and not much diversity everything would be up around 100% range."},"1151":{"dur":2,"text":"Instead what we found was this incredible diversity,"},"1154":{"dur":3,"text":"where all these organisms have basically the same 16 sRNA sequence"},"1158":{"dur":3,"text":"so we thought there was not this kind of diversity underneath."},"1163":{"dur":7,"text":"But instead of being a single organisms or eleven maybe 20,000 different related organisms."},"1171":{"dur":4,"text":"In fact if we look at this broadly of what\u00eds falling out what were thought to be basically"},"1176":{"dur":5,"text":"single organisms now are of the major taxa that we\u00edre finding in the ocean."},"1182":{"dur":5,"text":"Some of these were unknown before seeing these clouds of organisms."},"1188":{"dur":3,"text":"So if people talk to you about a single organism from the environment,"},"1192":{"dur":6,"text":"it\u00eds basically a meaningless concept whether that environment is your gut, the ocean or the atmosphere."},"1199":{"dur":2,"text":"We\u00edve also looked at deep sea microbes."},"1203":{"dur":7,"text":"So this is the high temperature vent in the Pacific Ocean  were Holger Jannasch isolated this organism."},"1210":{"dur":7,"text":"This is the first archaea genome that we sequenced in 1996 and this is a complete anecdote,"},"1218":{"dur":2,"text":"it doesn\u00edt need any organic compounds."},"1220":{"dur":6,"text":"It makes everything it needs from life from carbon dioxide and hydrogen as an energy source."},"1227":{"dur":4,"text":"So, this is one of the many CO2 utilizers out there in the sense"},"1233":{"dur":5,"text":"inspired us to go in directions of capturing CO2 for energy production."},"1239":{"dur":7,"text":"But part of a program we have would be peer looking \n for microbes deep on the earth to do unique metabolism of hydrocarbons,"},"1247":{"dur":5,"text":"we came up with the same level of diversity deep on the earth that we find in the oceans."},"1252":{"dur":5,"text":"But something is very different about them; perhaps because a mile deep they\u00edre shielded from radiation,"},"1258":{"dur":4,"text":"they certainly don\u00edt get any UV radiation there."},"1262":{"dur":4,"text":"Instead of seeing these huge clouds going down to 50% diversity,"},"1266":{"dur":5,"text":"you can see things are clustered much more like people expected initially to find in the oceans."},"1272":{"dur":2,"text":"It\u00eds a much smaller set."},"1274":{"dur":5,"text":"We have the diversity in terms of different types of organisms but the depth from all the mutations"},"1280":{"dur":6,"text":"you might see are caused by UV radiation in the oceans doesn\u00edt occur deep in the Earth."},"1287":{"dur":4,"text":"So we have a whole range of different types of organisms that could be captured."},"1292":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, if you want to discover a more mammalian genes we have to hope"},"1297":{"dur":2,"text":"and that there\u00eds going to be strange mammals on different planets"},"1300":{"dur":6,"text":"because there\u00eds no point in sequencing more mammals on Earth to discover new genes that\u00eds basically saturated."},"1307":{"dur":5,"text":"But if we\u00edre looking at viruses, bacteria, archaea, we\u00edre still in the linear phase of discovery"},"1313":{"dur":6,"text":"even though we\u00edve exceeded 50 million genes now in our databases. It\u00eds still growing exponentially."},"1320":{"dur":8,"text":"We can take a sample anywhere in the world out of an aqueous system and majority of genes will be new in that sample."},"1330":{"dur":3,"text":"So minimal life is something that came out of our early studies."},"1333":{"dur":4,"text":"In fact, inspired by some NASA scientist."},"1338":{"dur":4,"text":"When we sequenced this genome, it\u00eds the second one we did in 1995."},"1343":{"dur":10,"text":"This has the smallest genome of a self replicating organism with only about 482 protein-coding genes and 43 RNA genes."},"1354":{"dur":5,"text":"Now this was roughly around the time when some NASA scientist claim they found nanobacteria in some Martian meteors."},"1360":{"dur":3,"text":"So there was a lot of discussion then about minimal life what it could be."},"1365":{"dur":3,"text":"Turns out the volume of those so called nanobacteria were so small,"},"1368":{"dur":7,"text":"you couldn\u00edt even get a tiny piece of DNA or RNA in them so I think everybody pretty much concluded those were artifacts."},"1377":{"dur":2,"text":"These are much larger cells."},"1380":{"dur":1,"text":"We\u00edre trying to understand minimal life."},"1381":{"dur":5,"text":"So we had two genomes, and we asked how many of these genes are essential for life,"},"1387":{"dur":4,"text":"what\u00eds the smallest number of genes required for cellular life,"},"1392":{"dur":5,"text":"and ultimately could we design and construct such a minimal genome?"},"1397":{"dur":4,"text":"We took a variety of approaches, comparative genomics in the computer."},"1401":{"dur":3,"text":"Trying to knock out genes to see which ones were essential and"},"1405":{"dur":5,"text":"we realized we could only get there by making a synthetic chromosome."},"1411":{"dur":7,"text":"When we looked at the first two genomes that we sequenced and this was a study out of NIH from Koonin\u00eds lab,"},"1418":{"dur":5,"text":"you can see a pretty small overlap between the first two genomes."},"1424":{"dur":6,"text":"They actually concluded that gene diversity in our planet must be really small to have this extent of overlap."},"1432":{"dur":6,"text":"If they waited 6 more months till we had the methanococcus \n genome they would have come to totally different conclusions."},"1438":{"dur":3,"text":"So comparative genomics could only take us so far."},"1441":{"dur":5,"text":"Clyde Hutchison at the institute developed this technique called whole genome transposon mutagenesis."},"1447":{"dur":5,"text":"So transposons are these small pieces of DNA that jump around in the genetic code."},"1453":{"dur":5,"text":"Over half of our human genome is composed of these transposons."},"1458":{"dur":3,"text":"They\u00edre constantly jumping around and if they jump in to the middle of a key gene,"},"1463":{"dur":5,"text":"we can get a disease or next generations won\u00edt exist with these."},"1468":{"dur":1,"text":"But because we had the sequence of the genome,"},"1470":{"dur":3,"text":"we could put in these transposons which go in randomly and then"},"1473":{"dur":3,"text":"you can sequence off those and know exactly where they went in."},"1477":{"dur":4,"text":"So we were able to over the years develop this map of the Mycoplasma genitalium genome."},"1482":{"dur":6,"text":"Every place you see one of these little triangles that\u00eds where a transposon randomly inserted in the cell."},"1489":{"dur":3,"text":"So if the cell could live with one of these transposons in it,"},"1493":{"dur":4,"text":"we define that gene that it was in as a non-essential gene."},"1498":{"dur":4,"text":"You know, see there\u00eds some little bars on here with no transposons in them;"},"1503":{"dur":3,"text":"basically we define those as essential genes."},"1507":{"dur":4,"text":"But the trouble is the term essential and non-essential is totally context specific."},"1512":{"dur":9,"text":"It turns out this cell will grow nicely on both glucose and fructose and there\u00eds a gene for the transporter for each one."},"1522":{"dur":4,"text":"If you have both sugars in the media and you knock out the glucose transporter,"},"1526":{"dur":5,"text":"the cell keeps living and you say, well that glucose transporter must be a non-essential gene."},"1532":{"dur":5,"text":"But if you\u00edre only growing the cells on glucose and you knock off the glucose transporter gene, the cell dies."},"1538":{"dur":7,"text":"So we can only define the genetics, including our own genetics, in the context of the environment that it\u00eds in."},"1546":{"dur":5,"text":"And I think that\u00eds an important concept when you think of these confined or limited environments."},"1552":{"dur":6,"text":"When we look at the metabolic map of the cell and then look at all the genes that could be knocked out one at a time,"},"1558":{"dur":3,"text":"we decided this would probably not lead to a viable cell."},"1562":{"dur":4,"text":"So it turns out there\u00eds genes that cover the duplicate function,"},"1567":{"dur":5,"text":"you know, they are back up systems like NASA likes to have and so if you knock out one gene,"},"1573":{"dur":4,"text":"it doesn\u00edt really tell you whether that\u00eds an essential function."},"1577":{"dur":1,"text":"So after spending years doing this,"},"1579":{"dur":3,"text":"we decided the only approach was to make a synthetic chromosome"},"1582":{"dur":3,"text":"where we could control completely the genetic content."},"1587":{"dur":1,"text":"So then we had new technical questions,"},"1588":{"dur":5,"text":"would the chemistry even permit us to be able to make these large pieces of DNA and if we could,"},"1594":{"dur":3,"text":"would we just have a large inert chemical or could we boot it up?"},"1599":{"dur":5,"text":"So jumping ahead to 2003, we tried a number of approaches."},"1604":{"dur":2,"text":"We underwent some very critical ethical review that"},"1606":{"dur":4,"text":"I\u00edll get back to and we developed some techniques for error correction."},"1610":{"dur":5,"text":"So the DNA synthesizers are not great machines."},"1616":{"dur":2,"text":"They create errors in the DNA as they make one."},"1618":{"dur":6,"text":"It\u00eds an N minus one situation, the longer the piece of DNA you make the more errors."},"1625":{"dur":4,"text":"And because of that, we either need error correction methods like we published here."},"1629":{"dur":3,"text":"And what we did here, we started with the viral sequence in the computer."},"1633":{"dur":6,"text":"We made these small pieces of DNA that we assembled together to make the whole genome."},"1640":{"dur":6,"text":"And the exciting phase came, we inserted this piece of inert chemical in to E. coli"},"1646":{"dur":6,"text":"and the E. coli genome system started reading this piece of DNA. Started making all the proteins."},"1653":{"dur":5,"text":"The protein self assembled to make the virus and the virus showed its gratitude by killing the cells"},"1658":{"dur":5,"text":"that made it which is how we detected with this clear plaques on a plate."},"1663":{"dur":3,"text":"So we call this a situation where the software is actually building its own hardware."},"1668":{"dur":2,"text":"All we did was put in a chemical piece of software and that"},"1670":{"dur":6,"text":"led to making this a physical structure that has biological activity."},"1677":{"dur":2,"text":"But we didn\u00edt want to make just a small virus."},"1680":{"dur":4,"text":"We wanted to make an entire bacterial chromosome and there were two aspects as I said,"},"1684":{"dur":2,"text":"one, could you boot up the DNA,"},"1686":{"dur":3,"text":"it was easy with the viral DNA in E. coli but we didn\u00edt think"},"1689":{"dur":4,"text":"it would be so easy with trying to boot up an entire bacterial genome."},"1694":{"dur":7,"text":"So this study in 2007 that we published on booting up and transplanting the genome."},"1701":{"dur":3,"text":"I think that\u00eds actually one of the most important ones our team\u00eds ever"},"1705":{"dur":4,"text":"published because we actually by changing the genome in a cell,"},"1709":{"dur":4,"text":"we completely converted one species into another."},"1713":{"dur":3,"text":"And it seems like alchemy or something to many people until you really understand"},"1717":{"dur":5,"text":"the importance of DNA and the importance of genetics and how life actually works."},"1722":{"dur":3,"text":"Because this is so important, I thought I\u00edd walk you through it."},"1725":{"dur":5,"text":"So we isolated the DNA from M. mycoides."},"1731":{"dur":5,"text":"These are a very simple cells with just plasma membranes."},"1736":{"dur":7,"text":"We needed to know, for example were proteins required to do transplantation because if we\u00edre just making chemical DNA,"},"1744":{"dur":6,"text":"we need to know if proteins were involved so we treated it harshly with proteinases and removed all the proteins."},"1751":{"dur":3,"text":"We added a few gene cassettes so we could select for the chromosome,"},"1755":{"dur":4,"text":"and they would turn themselves bright blue if it got activated."},"1759":{"dur":6,"text":"And we worked out ways to insert that genome into a related cell, M. capricolum."},"1766":{"dur":1,"text":"And we thought about this for a long time."},"1768":{"dur":7,"text":"We thought we would have to eliminate the chromosome in the recipient cell before we put in the new one."},"1776":{"dur":3,"text":"And we worked on a lot of ways to do that with radiation damage,"},"1779":{"dur":2,"text":"chemical damage and finally after trying a number of things,"},"1782":{"dur":2,"text":"we decided maybe we don\u00edt have to do that,"},"1785":{"dur":5,"text":"and we could use the enzymatic systems in the cell themselves to do this for us."},"1790":{"dur":5,"text":"So we have this very sophisticated movie to show you what we think happened."},"1796":{"dur":3,"text":"So we inserted the new chromosome in the cell and for a brief period"},"1799":{"dur":5,"text":"of time now we have a capricolum cell with two different chromosomes in it."},"1805":{"dur":6,"text":"As with the viral piece of DNA, the cell system started reading the new chromosome and started making proteins."},"1812":{"dur":4,"text":"Some of the early proteins that are made are restriction enzymes."},"1818":{"dur":9,"text":"The restriction enzymes that were made, recognized the capricolum chromosome as foreign DNA and chewed it up."},"1828":{"dur":8,"text":"So now we have a capricolum cell with the information system the chromosome from M. mycoides."},"1837":{"dur":6,"text":"In a very short period of time, we had these bright blue cells and when we looked at these cells,"},"1844":{"dur":4,"text":"all the characteristics of the capricolum species were gone."},"1848":{"dur":5,"text":"All the proteins that existed in the cell were those coded for by the M. mycoides chromosome."},"1854":{"dur":3,"text":"So simply by changing the software, all the characteristics of"},"1857":{"dur":4,"text":"one species went away and we had an entirely, a new one coded for."},"1863":{"dur":2,"text":"So we knew now we could do transplants."},"1865":{"dur":8,"text":"So jumping ahead to 2008, we had teams working diligently on the chemistry to make these larger pieces of DNA."},"1874":{"dur":6,"text":"We knew we could make viral pieces accurately so we thought if we made a series of this viral size pieces,"},"1881":{"dur":3,"text":"we could perhaps assemble these with homologous recombination."},"1884":{"dur":4,"text":"And that\u00eds where a study of biology certainly helped us with different systems."},"1889":{"dur":6,"text":"So we made 101 of these cassettes that were 5,000 to 7,000 letters each."},"1895":{"dur":6,"text":"And then we went through this assembly process of assembling these pieces together on the lab bench,"},"1902":{"dur":5,"text":"first at the 6kb range then going up to 24kb."},"1907":{"dur":7,"text":"And in each stage we cloned these pieces in a coli and sequenced them trying to make sure it was really a valid process,"},"1914":{"dur":4,"text":"but and we kept going until we got up over 100000 base pairs."},"1919":{"dur":3,"text":"An E. coli would only take 2 of the 4 pieces,"},"1922":{"dur":7,"text":"so we started looking around for a new system as Mike Montague said earlier and we settled on yeast,"},"1929":{"dur":4,"text":"because not only did it happily clone these larger pieces,"},"1934":{"dur":3,"text":"the homologous recombination system and yeast assembled those."},"1938":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, we\u00edd spent years studying DInococcus radiodurans."},"1941":{"dur":6,"text":"So, this is one of the earliest genomes we sequenced with the DOE."},"1947":{"dur":6,"text":"This cell has 4 different DNA elements, 3 chromosomes and a plasmid"},"1954":{"dur":5,"text":"and it can take up to 3 million rounds or radiation and not be killed."},"1959":{"dur":6,"text":"What happens is you get a couple of hundred double stranded brakes that chromosomes literally get blown apart,"},"1965":{"dur":3,"text":"but if it\u00eds in an aqueous environment, 12 to 24 hours later,"},"1969":{"dur":5,"text":"it reassembles its chromosome and the cell starts replicating again."},"1975":{"dur":3,"text":"It could be pretty nice for space traveller if humans could do that,"},"1978":{"dur":6,"text":"but it\u00eds a much more complex equation where 6 billion letters of genetic code other than a few million."},"1985":{"dur":7,"text":"But we thought we could use these processes and we expended several postdoc year lives on this,"},"1993":{"dur":4,"text":"but never got it to work outside the cell and so we\u00edre delighted that we could jump ahead"},"1998":{"dur":7,"text":"and use simple brewer\u00eds yeast with it\u00eds powerful homologous recombination system to do this."},"2006":{"dur":6,"text":"So, we were able to put just the 4 quarter molecules with proper overlaps and this simple vector."},"2011":{"dur":6,"text":"And what this vector has in it, is an artificial yeast centromere."},"2018":{"dur":5,"text":"And so just adding a centromere, a eukaryotic centromere to this bacterial clones,"},"2024":{"dur":8,"text":"yeast assembled all these immediately into the entire bacterial chromosome and that\u00eds what we reported on 2008."},"2034":{"dur":5,"text":"And that was the almost 600,000 base pair genome sequence"},"2040":{"dur":4,"text":"assembled from 4 bottles of chemicals and using this assembly process."},"2045":{"dur":3,"text":"The trouble is, as Michael said, these cells grow extremely slowly."},"2050":{"dur":3,"text":"We have still not been able to boot up this chromosome because we think in the"},"2054":{"dur":3,"text":"6 weeks that it takes to do that the selection processes aren\u00edt adequate."},"2058":{"dur":1,"text":"We also discovered a few other things."},"2060":{"dur":6,"text":"Some of these cells have nucleases on the cell surface and they just chew up the DNA as fast as you expose it."},"2067":{"dur":3,"text":"For jumping ahead, we had to solve a number of problems."},"2070":{"dur":5,"text":"Michael mentioned how we could throw in smaller pieces in good assembly and so Dan Gibson"},"2077":{"dur":6,"text":"who did all this work wanted to see if we could just throw in tiny DNA fragments in to yeast and get assembly."},"2083":{"dur":6,"text":"So we could just put all simple nucleotides in to yeast and it will assemble those nicely into larger pieces."},"2090":{"dur":4,"text":"But the real breakthrough that Dan came up with after studying these reactions is"},"2095":{"dur":7,"text":"this very simple single pot chemical reaction that actually allows us now to automate all these processes."},"2103":{"dur":4,"text":"It\u00eds just three enzymes, one that chewes back the DNA,"},"2107":{"dur":4,"text":"another one that ligates it together and then fills in with this fusion polymerase."},"2112":{"dur":3,"text":"So it\u00eds a one step reaction at 50 degrees centigrade."},"2117":{"dur":6,"text":"All you do is put in the synthetic pieces of small DNA and it assembles them into larger pieces."},"2125":{"dur":17,"text":"We can go from the digital world to making an entire analogue of molecules potentially even booting them up."},"2143":{"dur":3,"text":"Danny Hillis and I are talking about trying to build a robot,"},"2147":{"dur":3,"text":"that's a self-learning robot system that could do these experiments"},"2151":{"dur":4,"text":"and learn biology a thousand times faster than any scientist can."},"2156":{"dur":1,"text":"We have a lot of biology to learn,"},"2158":{"dur":3,"text":"we don't know what most of these 50 million genes we\u00edve already discovered is."},"2162":{"dur":4,"text":"But if we can automate these processes going from the digital world into creating new life forms,"},"2167":{"dur":2,"text":"we have a chance to learn a whole lot faster."},"2171":{"dur":5,"text":"So our problem was, we were assembling the bacterial chromosome inside a eukaryote."},"2177":{"dur":7,"text":"To do the transplants, we have to find a way to isolate the DNA from the eukaryote and get it back into  a bacteria."},"2186":{"dur":7,"text":"And Gwen Binders at the institute cloned entire chromosomes in yeast, adding the simple yeast centromere."},"2194":{"dur":3,"text":"So that gave us the ability to these trial experiments."},"2197":{"dur":2,"text":"But we ran into a problem."},"2200":{"dur":1,"text":"It didn't work."},"2202":{"dur":5,"text":"We couldn't take the chromosome, that native chromosome out of yeast and transplant it."},"2207":{"dur":4,"text":"So it took our team of roughly 25 scientists two years to solve this problem."},"2212":{"dur":4,"text":"It turns out that the DNA, when we isolated it from the bacterial cell was methylated."},"2217":{"dur":5,"text":"And that methylation protected it from the restriction enzymes that the Capricolum cell had."},"2224":{"dur":7,"text":"The genome was using its own restriction enzymes to destroy that enzyme but it was getting destroyed first."},"2231":{"dur":4,"text":"So if we purified the specific methylases and methylated the DNA,"},"2236":{"dur":7,"text":"we could then readily do the transplants out of yeast into the bacteria."},"2243":{"dur":5,"text":"So we actually have this circle that allows us to make very rapid changes now genetically."},"2249":{"dur":3,"text":"And for those of you who work with microbes, some of the biggest limitations"},"2252":{"dur":3,"text":"working with microbes is that they don't have genetic systems."},"2256":{"dur":5,"text":"So simply isolating the chromosome from the microbe, putting it into yeast,"},"2262":{"dur":5,"text":"we can now modify that chromosome using a whole repertoire of yeast eukaryotic genetics."},"2268":{"dur":6,"text":"We can then isolate it, methylate it if necessary, and transplant it into a recipient cell forming a new species."},"2275":{"dur":4,"text":"And we can go around this circle very rapidly."},"2279":{"dur":6,"text":"So we made the decision early on because of the problem with the slow growth of the microplasmic genitalium,"},"2287":{"dur":5,"text":"to make a leap, knowing that we could transplant the mycoides genome,"},"2293":{"dur":5,"text":"to resynthesize that genome, even though it was a much larger project."},"2298":{"dur":5,"text":"And initially we thought DNA synthesis was going to be the limitation of the biology."},"2303":{"dur":5,"text":"So this is what we reported this spring and so the process was again starting with these all of the nucleotides"},"2310":{"dur":4,"text":"but now using this new single-part assembly method."},"2314":{"dur":2,"text":"So we could start with 1-kb pieces."},"2317":{"dur":5,"text":"In fact John Mulligan, who is here, made all those for us at Blue Heron."},"2323":{"dur":6,"text":"To speed up the process we then took ten 1-kb pieces; put them together and made 10-kb pieces."},"2331":{"dur":7,"text":"We then took ten of the 10-kb pieces together and made 100-kb pieces."},"2338":{"dur":5,"text":"And then there were eleven 1100-kb pieces that we put together in yeast"},"2345":{"dur":2,"text":"to assemble this entire million base pair chromosome."},"2347":{"dur":4,"text":"At this stage I was totally certain that it was now just a matter of simply doing the experiment."},"2353":{"dur":6,"text":"And I boldly predicted that we would have the first synthetic species by Christmas last year."},"2359":{"dur":2,"text":"Obviously I was wrong."},"2362":{"dur":4,"text":"For some reason we could never get a living cell out of it."},"2367":{"dur":6,"text":"So just like software engineers have proof-reading software, we had to developed DNA proof-reading software."},"2373":{"dur":7,"text":"And what we did was actually made naturally occurring 100-kb pieces, so we could substitute those."},"2381":{"dur":5,"text":"And so we could get ten synthetic pieces and one natural one, and we could boot that up."},"2387":{"dur":3,"text":"So we knew there was a problem in this one piece."},"2390":{"dur":6,"text":"And part of the problem is that the new sequencing technology is not as accurate as the old Sanger sequencing."},"2397":{"dur":4,"text":"So even though we'd sequenced that, it couldn\u00edt find this one base pair deletion."},"2401":{"dur":4,"text":"So one error out of a million base pairs and we got no life."},"2406":{"dur":6,"text":"So we re-sequenced it with Sanger sequencing, and found the single base pair deletion in the central gene."},"2412":{"dur":7,"text":"Then remade the piece, and booted it up, and here\u00eds the complete map"},"2420":{"dur":5,"text":"and here\u00eds the cells that resulted from the transplant."},"2426":{"dur":4,"text":"Let me go back a minute \u00ebcoz we did some things that when you think about the problems you could have with serum,"},"2431":{"dur":4,"text":"you could fool yourself and fool others."},"2435":{"dur":5,"text":"Our biggest concern was a single molecule contamination of the native genome."},"2441":{"dur":5,"text":"With living cells we could think that we actually had made a synthetic genome activated."},"2446":{"dur":2,"text":"That would have been a contaminant."},"2449":{"dur":3,"text":"So we started this concept of watermarking the DNA."},"2453":{"dur":3,"text":"And the first genome we made we just signed our names in it and people thought that was very unimaginative."},"2457":{"dur":6,"text":"So we got a little bit more imaginative with this second genome."},"2464":{"dur":6,"text":"And Mike Montague and Harold Smith and Clyde Hutchison developed a new code within the code within the code."},"2470":{"dur":5,"text":"So in the first watermark is the code for actually translating DNA into English"},"2477":{"dur":4,"text":"or English into DNA with complete punctuation."},"2481":{"dur":6,"text":"A large number of scientists have now solved this code. And there's an email address built into the genome."},"2488":{"dur":6,"text":"So they solved the code and sent an email to the web address proving that they had adequately decoded it."},"2495":{"dur":3,"text":"But once you decode that it tells you how to read the rest of it."},"2499":{"dur":4,"text":"We have 46 names of all the different scientists that have been involved in this project."},"2505":{"dur":4,"text":"And we tried to get creative and add a few quotations from the literature."},"2509":{"dur":6,"text":"So we had one from James Joyce, one from Oppenheimer's biography and one from Richard Feynman."},"2516":{"dur":4,"text":"And just to show you can never get away for free with anything,"},"2520":{"dur":5,"text":"after this was published we got a phone call from James Joyce Estate"},"2526":{"dur":3,"text":"saying that we hadn't sought his permission to use this quotation."},"2530":{"dur":5,"text":"And you know I know we\u00edre, we have powerful techniques but I didn't know quite how to do that 'coz he was dead."},"2536":{"dur":3,"text":"But... So all these is built into the genetic code."},"2540":{"dur":5,"text":"I think the chances of this occurring naturally is pretty close to zero."},"2546":{"dur":6,"text":"So the difference is we can insert all of this, what would appear to nonsense DNA."},"2552":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, part of our code is to put frequent stop codons into it"},"2557":{"dur":4,"text":"so we don't introduce new biology in to the cell by making new fragments."},"2562":{"dur":4,"text":"On the other hand, if we have one error in the central gene, you get no life."},"2567":{"dur":4,"text":"So where it is in the genome and what it is is obviously very critical."},"2571":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the map of the whole genome."},"2573":{"dur":8,"text":"So unlike our genetic code which is only about three percent of our genome codes for protein coding genes,"},"2582":{"dur":1,"text":"and this, it\u00eds well over 90 percent."},"2584":{"dur":2,"text":"You can see, there's not a lot of gaps between the genes."},"2587":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's a much more efficient system."},"2591":{"dur":4,"text":"Again, when we checked, there were no capricolum proteins left."},"2596":{"dur":5,"text":"It was just the proteins made from this modified genome."},"2601":{"dur":7,"text":"So this is the size range that\u00eds happened over this period of time, now being over a million base pairs."},"2609":{"dur":6,"text":"These techniques are so robust Dan Gibson  reassembled the genome for each experiment"},"2616":{"dur":2,"text":"instead of trying to use a clone variety of it."},"2619":{"dur":3,"text":"So they're truly robust and now they\u00edre able to be automated."},"2623":{"dur":2,"text":"I think we're gonna enter into a new era."},"2625":{"dur":4,"text":"So I like to think of all these genes we\u00edve discovered today as design components."},"2630":{"dur":7,"text":"In the electronics industry, people in the 40s and 50s had far fewer design components to work with."},"2638":{"dur":3,"text":"By the time we finished characterizing life on this planet,"},"2642":{"dur":9,"text":"this number could be two or three hundred million unique genes or genes that are part of complex gene families."},"2652":{"dur":5,"text":"We actually have software synthetic genomics for designing software of life"},"2658":{"dur":6,"text":"to create new organisms where we can modularly build in the type of metabolism."},"2664":{"dur":1,"text":"Is it going to be metabolizing sugars?"},"2666":{"dur":7,"text":"Is it gonna take to CO2 to methane etcetera as building a backbone to try and design future organisms?"},"2675":{"dur":5,"text":"Because there is so much gene diversity and so few scientists on this planet,"},"2681":{"dur":4,"text":"we have to come up with new combinatorial approaches to make some rapid progress here."},"2686":{"dur":6,"text":"So just think if you have a metabolic pathway with only ten genes in it,"},"2693":{"dur":0,"text":"and if you have ten versions of each of those ten genes."},"2694":{"dur":1,"text":"That's ten to the tenth combinations."},"2696":{"dur":2,"text":"It would take forever to get there."},"2699":{"dur":6,"text":"So we're trying to build this robot that could make a million chromosomes a day just for one or two scientists to work with."},"2706":{"dur":6,"text":"And if it really is self-learning, those scientist are probably just gonna watch the robot work like it happens with robotics."},"2713":{"dur":3,"text":"And then it gets down to what with all biology has been selection."},"2718":{"dur":3,"text":"Can you set up the right assays for selecting what you want out of it?"},"2722":{"dur":4,"text":"So, some of my different audience, hopefully not this one ask why do this?"},"2727":{"dur":2,"text":"But there's a lot of different reasons."},"2729":{"dur":6,"text":"Obviously burning all these fossil fuels were we\u00edve exceeded the equilibrium of CO2 capture on our planet."},"2736":{"dur":1,"text":"The oceans are the largest sink."},"2738":{"dur":7,"text":"This number keeps changing I think it's up to 3.8 million tons of new CO2 in the atmosphere."},"2747":{"dur":9,"text":"We're making more people faster than we can provide the means to feed them and provide medicine and housing and clean water."},"2757":{"dur":1,"text":"We're at 6.8 billion now."},"2758":{"dur":5,"text":"Within 35 to 40 years we'll be over 9 billion."},"2764":{"dur":1,"text":"Like any number, I like to put it in context."},"2766":{"dur":2,"text":"So I was born in 1946."},"2769":{"dur":5,"text":"There's now three people alive on the planet for everybody that existed the year that I was born."},"2775":{"dur":2,"text":"Soon there'll be four."},"2777":{"dur":5,"text":"All in almost a single generation do we have these huge changes."},"2783":{"dur":3,"text":"We can't provide all means for feeding the ones now."},"2786":{"dur":3,"text":"So we\u00edd need new approaches for the next generations."},"2790":{"dur":4,"text":"When we look at plants, plants are really not very productive systems."},"2795":{"dur":1,"text":"They're pretty limited."},"2797":{"dur":6,"text":"So we, like others, have looked around and even looking at kind of modest numbers \u00ebcoz we have to greatly
