sit?"},"320":{"dur":3,"text":"And you're moving into\nit every time, right?"},"324":{"dur":4,"text":"And then when you say sit,\nyour dog goes, no habla."},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"Because he really

this."},"378":{"dur":3,"text":"There's a famous trainer,\nwho I learned a lot from,"},"381":{"dur":2,"text":"who was talking about the first\ntime he was teaching

sits."},"432":{"dur":2,"text":"Therein lies a lot\nof the problems"},"435":{"dur":1,"text":"that we find when\nwe're trying to get"},"436":{"dur":1,"text":"our dog to that 100%

is based upon our\ntiming and understanding of how"},"448":{"dur":4,"text":"dogs verbally learn\nand physically learn."},"453":{"dur":3,"text":"So if we want our dogs to learn\na verbal command-- and let's"},"456":{"dur":3,"text":"put this all together, our\nclassical conditioning-- we"},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"teach them, sit."},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"We use a verbal\nmarker, then we teach"},"465":{"dur":4,"text":"them physically--\nthen the reward."},"469":{"dur":3,"text":"So here, sit."},"472":{"dur":0,"text":"Yes."},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"And again, that\none second-- kind"},"476":{"dur":1,"text":"of half a second to\none-second window that you"},"477":{"dur":1,"text":"can use to respond."},"479":{"dur":3,"text":"If you do this every\ntime you say yes,

through classical\nconditioning,"},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"we create our markers."},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"Then what we do is we move\ninto operant conditioning."},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"If you've taken those same\nclasses that taught you"},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"about Pavlov's dog and\nclassical conditioning,"},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"then you moved into\noperant

food."},"506":{"dur":0,"text":"Right?"},"507":{"dur":3,"text":"It's the dog where you\nhold a piece of food out,"},"510":{"dur":3,"text":"and you say nothing."},"514":{"dur":1,"text":"And the dog

down."},"564":{"dur":0,"text":"Then we add."},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"Now we back up our\nclassical conditioning"},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"to our operant conditioning."},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"So food comes out, his\nbutt hits the ground."},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes, treat."},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"Now we go, sit."},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"We use our operant\nconditioning, and we"},"577":{"dur":1,"text":"wait for the\nbehavior-- associate,"},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"name it, and reward it."},"582":{"dur":1,"text":"So he'll offer you a behavior."},"583":{"dur":4,"text":"You will then name it."},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"You want your dog to do\nsomething over and over,"},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"you have to name it."},"593":{"dur":1,"text":"So let's get into one\nof the biggest things"},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"that people run\ninto with recall."},"598":{"dur":4,"text":"And I know that's\nprobably a huge percentage"},"603":{"dur":1,"text":"of what I get calls for."},"605":{"dur":3,"text":"My dog just won't\ncome back to me."},"608":{"dur":3,"text":"Why won't my dog\ncome back to me?"},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"How do I teach my dog a

up to you\nor your trainer"},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"to figure out which method\nworks best for your dog."},"647":{"dur":1,"text":"But I can tell you this, right?"},"648":{"dur":1,"text":"From the time your\ndog is a puppy,"},"649":{"dur":3,"text":"you can teach a\npuppy how to recall"},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"and be very consistent in it."},"655":{"dur":1,"text":"Just by having--\nevery time the dog"},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"comes to you, as soon as\nhe starts to turn to you,"},"660":{"dur":1,"text":"name it, here."},"662":{"dur":1,"text":"He's coming, yes."},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"Good boy, good girl, good dog."},"667":{"dur":1,"text":"You start building that up."},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"And one of the things for our\ndogs that are very drivey--"},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"the dogs that will go chase\na toy, and puppies all"},"673":{"dur":3,"text":"will chase a toy--\nyou start with a place"},"677":{"dur":1,"text":"that you know he\ngoes to all the

here."},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"Whether it's under a\ntable or on his pillow,"},"686":{"dur":1,"text":"he's got this favorite place."},"688":{"dur":3,"text":"So we teach our dog\nto retrieve and

here."},"714":{"dur":1,"text":"And he has no idea\nwhat \"here\" means,"},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"but he's coming back to\nyou, and you're rewarded it."},"718":{"dur":4,"text":"Now he

you've"},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"got a dog that will\nhave a solid recall."},"729":{"dur":1,"text":"You do it in a low\ndistraction area,"},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"you do it with great reward,\nand you will find them."},"735":{"dur":4,"text":"So let me give you a few of\nthe ideas about marker training"},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"and why there's so\nmuch controversy"},"741":{"dur":3,"text":"around positive reinforcement\nversus aversive method,"},"745":{"dur":1,"text":"et cetera."},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"Everybody's heard reward-based\nor positive

doing."},"755":{"dur":6,"text":"Positive reinforcement only is--\nI'm going to put it out there."},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"I think it's causing\na lot of problems."},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"It's causing a lot\nof failures in dogs."},"766":{"dur":3,"text":"It's like the child who never\nlearns limits, the child who"},"769":{"dur":4,"text":"never is told no-- the child who\nnever learns through experience"},"774":{"dur":3,"text":"that there is a\nconsequence to behavior."},"780":{"dur":6,"text":"So the dog who has a problem\nwith chasing another dog, who"},"786":{"dur":1,"text":"you can't give enough food to."},"788":{"dur":3,"text":"Go, my dog would-- just\nkeeps chasing other dogs."},"791":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, yeah, because every time\nyou're feeding your dog-- you"},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"walk down the street, and\nyour trainer told you,"},"797":{"dur":3,"text":"just go behind this car and\nthen shove food in his face."},"800":{"dur":2,"text":"There's no behavior change."},"803":{"dur":3,"text":"And for a person who isn't\na professional dog trainer,"},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"it's hard to know where\nthat dog's head is"},"809":{"dur":1,"text":"at at that moment."},"810":{"dur":3,"text":"Are we rewarding a\nheightened state of mind"},"813":{"dur":1,"text":"when another dog comes around?"},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"So another dog comes around,\nor a dog gets excited,"},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"we pull him behind a\ncar and go, good boy."},"819":{"dur":2,"text":"So the dog kept going,\nI'm being rewarded"},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"for this behavior-- I\nmust be doing it right."},"824":{"dur":3,"text":"And I've seen some dogs spiral\nseriously out of control"},"828":{"dur":1,"text":"based upon that method alone."},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"For some

have"},"838":{"dur":3,"text":"come under so much scrutiny\nis because, yeah, it's"},"841":{"dur":1,"text":"uncomfortable."},"842":{"dur":1,"text":"And these are our little\nfour-legged

that there"},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"is a consequence to behavior."},"855":{"dur":1,"text":"And believe it or not,\nanybody who tells you"},"857":{"dur":3,"text":"they are reward-based only, or\npositive reinforcement only,"},"860":{"dur":5,"text":"lies because a punisher is\nas simple as removing food."},"866":{"dur":1,"text":"That's punishment."},"867":{"dur":2,"text":"It's called

a\npositive punisher."},"876":{"dur":1,"text":"We're adding something\nto the environment,"},"878":{"dur":2,"text":"whether it's-- again, most\nof the time it's something"},"881":{"dur":3,"text":"A little pop, a little\nflick, little aat-- something"},"884":{"dur":1,"text":"that adds to the environment."},"885":{"dur":2,"text":"When we take away-- we go\n\"sit,\" and he goes, ah,"},"888":{"dur":1,"text":"I think I'd rather\ngo look at squirrels."},"890":{"dur":2,"text":"We remove the food, and\nhe goes, wait a minute."},"892":{"dur":2,"text":"That's a negative

put that\nout there, we'll move on."},"901":{"dur":1,"text":"All right."},"903":{"dur":2,"text":"So how does marker trainer work?"},"905":{"dur":2,"text":"We just talked about\nclicker training."},"908":{"dur":2,"text":"A lot of the clicker\ntraining came"},"910":{"dur":4,"text":"from a Dr. Skinner who found\nwith training marine mammals"},"915":{"dur":2,"text":"when that animal\nis away from them,"},"917":{"dur":2,"text":"they could not get through\nwater and everything else."},"920":{"dur":2,"text":"They learned clickers\ntravel through water."},"922":{"dur":3,"text":"Now you

way."},"930":{"dur":3,"text":"Because he says, look, we don't\nhave to correct an animal--"},"934":{"dur":2,"text":"a 3,000-pound animal or bigger."},"937":{"dur":2,"text":"Why do we have to correct a dog?"},"939":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, if I put my dog in a tank\nwith no other dogs around him,"},"944":{"dur":2,"text":"with no other squirrels\nto run by him,"},"947":{"dur":3,"text":"and the only
