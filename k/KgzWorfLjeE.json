arcades working"},"2451":{"dur":1,"text":"and then there will\nbe a patch that"},"2453":{"dur":1,"text":"will get them all functioning."},"2454":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's one example."},"2456":{"dur":1,"text":"The other example\nthat comes to mind,"},"2458":{"dur":2,"text":"if you play \"Maniac\nMansion,\" there"},"2460":{"dur":2,"text":"are several ladders in the

sir."},"2739":{"dur":1,"text":"First of all, your\ngames are amazing."},"2740":{"dur":1,"text":"Thanks."},"2742":{"dur":2,"text":"We played them in Brazil."},"2744":{"dur":3,"text":"So one thing that's different,\nyou talk about Sierra games"},"2748":{"dur":2,"text":"a little, is that they\nwere very punishing."},"2750":{"dur":0,"text":"So you die."},"2751":{"dur":2,"text":"You die, and you

die"},"2765":{"dur":2,"text":"and you have to restart\nover it and sometimes it's"},"2768":{"dur":1,"text":"kind of boring."},"2769":{"dur":4,"text":"And how does it impact\nyour game design

over."},"2787":{"dur":3,"text":"It's like, there was this\ncan of Pepsi that you find,"},"2791":{"dur":3,"text":"which was actually product\nplacement, I might add."},"2794":{"dur":5,"text":"There was this can of Pepsi\nin the game and you needed it."},"2800":{"dur":2,"text":"You needed to give it\nto the man-eating plant,"},"2803":{"dur":2,"text":"so the man-eating plant\nwould start burping."},"2805":{"dur":2,"text":"So then you could climb\nup the man-eating plant."},"2807":{"dur":1,"text":"But you could also\ntake the can of Pepsi"},"2809":{"dur":4,"text":"and you could pour\nit down the drain."},"2813":{"dur":4,"text":"And if you did that there\nwas no way to win the game."},"2817":{"dur":2,"text":"Because you didn't have\na can of Pepsi anymore."},"2819":{"dur":3,"text":"And we never told you that."},"2822":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, so you would pour\nthe can of Pepsi down the drain"},"2825":{"dur":2,"text":"or you would do

I think some of that\ncomes from just being naive,"},"2836":{"dur":1,"text":"that it really was\nthe first adventure"},"2838":{"dur":1,"text":"game that we had done."},"2839":{"dur":4,"text":"And \"Maniac Mansion\" is just\nfilled with that kind of stuff."},"2844":{"dur":1,"text":"And when I went and I did--"},"2845":{"dur":1,"text":"right before I did\n\"Monkey Island\""},"2847":{"dur":3,"text":"I wrote this article for this--"},"2850":{"dur":2,"text":"it was called the Journal of\nComputer Game Design really"},"2853":{"dur":1,"text":"high-falluting sounding name."},"2855":{"dur":3,"text":"But it was this little magazine\nthat you could do stuff."},"2859":{"dur":1,"text":"And I submitted\nthis article called"},"2860":{"dur":5,"text":"\"Why Adventure

site\ngrumpygamer.com,"},"2870":{"dur":3,"text":"it's actually up there\nand you can read it."},"2873":{"dur":4,"text":"And one of the rules that I\ncome up with was, no

you've spent\nthis time, you're"},"2889":{"dur":2,"text":"living in this pirate world."},"2891":{"dur":2,"text":"And suddenly you die,\nand you're pulled out"},"2894":{"dur":0,"text":"of the whole fantasy."},"2895":{"dur":2,"text":"And you have to pull up\nthis menu of saved games"},"2897":{"dur":3,"text":"and you have to go find your\nlast saved game and load it."},"2901":{"dur":1,"text":"And that just felt wrong to me."},"2902":{"dur":3,"text":"It felt to me that you should\nbe able to start the game,"},"2906":{"dur":2,"text":"and sit down in\nyour big comfy chair"},"2908":{"dur":3,"text":"and just lose yourself for\nhours and just never get"},"2912":{"dur":1,"text":"pulled out of the fantasy."},"2914":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that was really\nkind of the main reason"},"2916":{"dur":3,"text":"that I just said,\nthere's just no death."},"2919":{"dur":1,"text":"No death in adventure games."},"2921":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's kind of that reason."},"2922":{"dur":1,"text":"AUDIENCE: Thanks for doing that."},"2923":{"dur":2,"text":"RON GILBERT: Thank you."},"2925":{"dur":3,"text":"SPEAKER: Any more questions?"},"2929":{"dur":4,"text":"I have one more, and\nthen I think we finished."},"2933":{"dur":3,"text":"Last year was the\nbig year for VR."},"2936":{"dur":4,"text":"So that is quite a\ntwo-dimensional game,

from it."},"2962":{"dur":3,"text":"So I don't do a lot of VR,\nso I'm the first person"},"2966":{"dur":3,"text":"to kind of say I don't\nknow that I understand VR."},"2969":{"dur":3,"text":"Because I don't really do\nit with that kind of stuff."},"2973":{"dur":1,"text":"It does kind of occur to me--"},"2975":{"dur":3,"text":"like, I think VR is\nabsolutely the future."},"2978":{"dur":1,"text":"There's no question about that."},"2980":{"dur":3,"text":"I just I kind of think\nthat future is 25 or 30"},"2983":{"dur":3,"text":"years from now, not right now."},"2986":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think that's just\na technology problem."},"2989":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that as soon as\nyou're strapping something"},"2991":{"dur":2,"text":"big and heavy

be"},"3007":{"dur":2,"text":"a little bit of a niche thing."},"3009":{"dur":4,"text":"But since I don't do VR,\nI'm not the best person"},"3014":{"dur":2,"text":"to answer that
