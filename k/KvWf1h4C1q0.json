checked?"},"43":{"dur":1,"text":"- My cholesterol's fantastic."},"45":{"dur":1,"text":"- See?\n- Oh man."},"46":{"dur":1,"text":"- Now Gary's going to say it's genetic,"},"47":{"dur":1,"text":"that he can't help it, right?"},"49":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's the theory right now,"},"51":{"dur":3,"text":"that's the theory we're going\nwith, that it's genetic."},"54":{"dur":0,"text":"- It's bad luck, huh?"},"55":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, bad genes."},"57":{"dur":1,"text":"- Besides fixing Gary's cholesterol,"},"58":{"dur":2,"text":"we have some fun stuff that\nwe're going to talk about."},"61":{"dur":3,"text":"- Fixing, there's no\nfixing, it's not fixed."},"64":{"dur":2,"text":"- I'm sure since Dave's\nis good he could tell you."},"66":{"dur":2,"text":"Like you probably put an\neffort into cholesterol, right?"},"69":{"dur":1,"text":"Eating the right stuff?"},"70":{"dur":1,"text":"- You got to do stuff, I mean it's not..."},"71":{"dur":1,"text":"- What's the strategy?"},"72":{"dur":1,"text":"- The strategy is to live right, Gary,"},"73":{"dur":1,"text":"give it a try."},"75":{"dur":1,"text":"- Oh, okay."},"76":{"dur":2,"text":"- So I would guess

Gary."},"106":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not that tough."},"107":{"dur":1,"text":"You've got to stop blaming bad luck,"},"108":{"dur":1,"text":"it's bad decisions Gary."},"110":{"dur":0,"text":"It's bad decisions."},"111":{"dur":1,"text":"- I'll take a mental note."},"112":{"dur":1,"text":"No french fries, no mayonnaise."},"114":{"dur":1,"text":"I think I've got it."},"115":{"dur":0,"text":"I've got it covered."},"116":{"dur":2,"text":"- You don't know how many\nburgers I've seen Gary eat,"},"118":{"dur":1,"text":"like just full on cheeseburgers."},"119":{"dur":1,"text":"- But it's genetic though."},"120":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, genetic."},"123":{"dur":3,"text":"See, and this applies\nto all aspects, Gary."},"127":{"dur":2,"text":"To business, to everything, right?"},"129":{"dur":1,"text":"- Okay, all right."},"130":{"dur":1,"text":"- It's the market, the market's down."},"132":{"dur":1,"text":"- It's, yeah."},"134":{"dur":1,"text":"My market is different."},"135":{"dur":3,"text":"My gene pool is different than you guys."},"138":{"dur":1,"text":"That's what I'm sticking with."},"140":{"dur":1,"text":"So we both, Dave,

Oh yeah."},"169":{"dur":1,"text":"Exactly the same for me."},"170":{"dur":2,"text":"I was a young manager,\nand then, of course,"},"172":{"dur":1,"text":"you know we don't have any training,"},"173":{"dur":2,"text":"there's no manuals to tell\nyou how to lead people,"},"176":{"dur":2,"text":"and you kind of feel lost and then"},"179":{"dur":2,"text":"I just happened onto some of your stuff"},"181":{"dur":3,"text":"and it, you know without\nbeing too dramatic,"},"184":{"dur":2,"text":"it definitely shined a\nbeacon of light and helped,"},"186":{"dur":1,"text":"okay, now there's a solution,"},"188":{"dur":1,"text":"there's someplace where I\ncan go to learn this stuff."},"189":{"dur":0,"text":"- That's awesome."},"190":{"dur":1,"text":"You guys talk about when you were young"},"192":{"dur":1,"text":"and I was like your dad,\nI'm not 100 you know."},"194":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughter)"},"195":{"dur":1,"text":"- No, we're not--"},"196":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean it really wasn't that long ago."},"199":{"dur":2,"text":"It wasn't, it goes by fast."},"202":{"dur":1,"text":"- It feels long but it\nwasn't that long ago."},"203":{"dur":0,"text":"- Yeah."},"204":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, how long has it been, Gary?"},"206":{"dur":1,"text":"Like 18 years?"},"208":{"dur":0,"text":"About that?"},"209":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, just about that."},"210":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah."},"211":{"dur":4,"text":"So my story is when I took over\nthe dealership I was running"},"217":{"dur":2,"text":"I bought your series of videos,"},"220":{"dur":3,"text":"and I would do a video every\nweek in my management class,"},"223":{"dur":3,"text":"and it was a great entry\nto me to get them talking"},"227":{"dur":2,"text":"and thinking, but I learned just as much"},"229":{"dur":0,"text":"as they did."},"230":{"dur":3,"text":"But it created a culture of\ngetting better and learning."},"233":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, the exercises--"},"234":{"dur":1,"text":"I forget the name of that course."},"236":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe it was Learn to Lead."},"237":{"dur":1,"text":"- I think it was Growing Great Leaders."},"238":{"dur":2,"text":"I think you had the Growing\nGreat Leaders course."},"240":{"dur":0,"text":"That's a great way to use it."},"241":{"dur":0,"text":"- The best."},"242":{"dur":2,"text":"Like, honestly, I've\nwatched that so many times"},"245":{"dur":3,"text":"and gone through that\nworkbook so many times."},"248":{"dur":2,"text":"And so it created a conversation\nand then I remember,"},"251":{"dur":1,"text":"and this is a funny story and I don't know"},"252":{"dur":2,"text":"if I've ever told you this, maybe I have,"},"255":{"dur":4,"text":"that we asked you to come\nout, we hired you to come out,"},"260":{"dur":1,"text":"and you came out and did a day,"},"262":{"dur":1,"text":"I think it was like on a Saturday."},"263":{"dur":0,"text":"- It was."},"264":{"dur":0,"text":"- Sunday or something."},"265":{"dur":1,"text":"- Right."},"266":{"dur":3,"text":"- And then the next month\nI read in your newsletter"},"269":{"dur":1,"text":"they used to do, do you\nstill do the newsletter?"},"271":{"dur":1,"text":"- No, I don't do the newsletter."},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"- But we subscribed to the newsletter."},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"- You did, we did it a lot of years."},"277":{"dur":2,"text":"- And I got it and your\nvery first thing in there"},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"was about how you were\nspeaking at a dealership,"},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"and then just something to the effect of,"},"285":{"dur":3,"text":"how can people ever want to\nsucceed when they have losers..."},"288":{"dur":1,"text":"You were describing our conference room"},"290":{"dur":1,"text":"and the sales boards we had up,"},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"that how could you ever want\nto succeed when you've got"},"294":{"dur":2,"text":"six car guys on the board."},"296":{"dur":2,"text":"- I didn't name you\nthough, I didn't name you."},"298":{"dur":0,"text":"- No, but I knew."},"299":{"dur":1,"text":"- You knew."},"300":{"dur":1,"text":"You're gonna have me come over,"},"302":{"dur":1,"text":"you gotta do something\nwith the sales board."},"303":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean you got to make\nstuff up or something."},"305":{"dur":1,"text":"But you can't have that up there."},"307":{"dur":1,"text":"- Make a note of that, Gary,"},"308":{"dur":2,"text":"Dave comes to the office\nwe got to hide everything."},"311":{"dur":3,"text":"- It was very accurate and great stuff."},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean alls that did is motivate me more."},"317":{"dur":1,"text":"But it was great."},"319":{"dur":2,"text":"But it was funny because\nI'm like reading that"},"321":{"dur":3,"text":"sitting in my office\ngoing, \"Oh man, what?\""},"324":{"dur":1,"text":"- You paid a lot for that info."},"326":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah."},"327":{"dur":0,"text":"Like, you can do that?"},"328":{"dur":2,"text":"You can write about me like that?"},"330":{"dur":1,"text":"It was pretty funny."},"332":{"dur":1,"text":"But no, we're big fans."},"335":{"dur":3,"text":"One question that I had for you is,"},"338":{"dur":1,"text":"is it 12 books you've put out?"},"340":{"dur":0,"text":"- 13."},"341":{"dur":0,"text":"- 13 books."},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"What's your favorite\nbook that you've done?"},"346":{"dur":1,"text":"- You know, they always\nsay the favorite one"},"347":{"dur":3,"text":"is either the last one or\nthe one you're working on,"},"350":{"dur":2,"text":"and my favorite one\nreally was the last one,"},"353":{"dur":1,"text":"which was It's Not Rocket Science."},"354":{"dur":1,"text":"- Which is a great title."},"356":{"dur":0,"text":"- Thanks."},"357":{"dur":1,"text":"- Well, it built on all the others,"},"359":{"dur":1,"text":"because it's about execution,"},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"and all the others would lay out a lot of"},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"vision, and strategy, and\nhere's what you need to do,"},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"and what this book really\ndid is really got into"},"368":{"dur":1,"text":"here's how you do it."},"369":{"dur":1,"text":"You've got to execute it."},"370":{"dur":1,"text":"You can have all kind of goals,"},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"you can have plans that fill the walls,"},"375":{"dur":1,"text":"but if you can't execute it."},"376":{"dur":2,"text":"So I present an execution process."},"378":{"dur":1,"text":"Most people don't have one."},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"If you sit down with a\ngroup of, even owners,"},"382":{"dur":3,"text":"and you ask them, \"List for\nme your execution process.\""},"385":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Write down the steps.\""},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"You get that blank, deer\ncaught in the headlights look."},"389":{"dur":1,"text":"They end up saying dumb stuff, like,"},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Well, we hold meetings, we\nset objectives, we follow up.\""},"393":{"dur":1,"text":"And still nothing's getting done,"},"394":{"dur":1,"text":"so that's not much of a process."},"396":{"dur":3,"text":"And so in the book I\npresent a really concise,"},"400":{"dur":3,"text":"workable process to help close that gap."},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's done really well."},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's why it's my favorite one"},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"because it ties together\nso much of the other things"},"408":{"dur":1,"text":"that I brought up in the other books."},"409":{"dur":3,"text":"It really is the bridge to\ngetting more of that stuff done."},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yeah, the wisdom and experience of time,"},"415":{"dur":1,"text":"kind of all in one."},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"- I couldn't have written\nthat book, 15-16 years ago."},"419":{"dur":1,"text":"I didn't know that stuff."},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, you get better,\nyou figure out what works,"},"423":{"dur":2,"text":"you work with people\nwho figure things out,"},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"and each book should reflect that,"},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"and should be even more\nrelevant than the last."},"429":{"dur":0,"text":"- I love that."},"430":{"dur":1,"text":"How long does it take you to write a book?"},"431":{"dur":0,"text":"- Four months."},"432":{"dur":1,"text":"- Four months, wow, so\nyou have a real system."},"434":{"dur":1,"text":"- I have a system."},"435":{"dur":1,"text":"- How long did it take you\nto write the first one?"},"437":{"dur":1,"text":"- The first one, you know, going back,"},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"God, that was a long time ago,"},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"the first one took longer."},"442":{"dur":1,"text":"The first one, you know\nwhat, the first one"},"443":{"dur":1,"text":"took about a year, you know why?"},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"I gave myself a year."},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"- Ah yeah, the deadline."},"448":{"dur":1,"text":"- If I'd have given myself two years,"},"450":{"dur":1,"text":"how long would it have taken?"},"451":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, two years."},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"- You know, when I started\nto be able to write them"},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"in four months when the publisher said,"},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"\"You need it done in four months,\""},"456":{"dur":1,"text":"and so I started to figure out"},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"how to get them done in four months."},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"But back when I had more\ntime I took more time."},"462":{"dur":1,"text":"Isn't that the way people are wired?"},"463":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah."},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"So you do you--"},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"By the way, my first\nbook took me three years."},"467":{"dur":0,"text":"- Three years."},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"- But I wrote three books basically."},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"So I started off with a ghostwriter,"},"472":{"dur":1,"text":"and then it didn't--"},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"Because you know in the car industry,"},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"it's so specific it just doesn't work."},"478":{"dur":1,"text":"It has to come from you."},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"- That's true."},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"- What I learned from\nthat is it took longer"},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"with the ghostwriter, redoing everything,"},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"than it did if I just did it."},"488":{"dur":1,"text":"And then the second one was okay,"},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"and then the third one I got it,"},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"but it was, it's hard, it's not easy."},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"Now I have a system, the same,"},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's much easier, but\nthe first one is hard."},"498":{"dur":3,"text":"- I write most of them on\nairplanes and in hotel rooms."},"501":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, just taking that down time"},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"and making use out of it."},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"If I'm flying from LA to Atlanta,"},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"I know that's about a\nfour hour-ish flight,"},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"I can get about 1,200 words done."},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"If I'm focused and I'm\nnot watching the movie"},"513":{"dur":1,"text":"or talking to the guy next to me about"},"515":{"dur":1,"text":"how uncomfortable the seat is,"},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"if I'm actually doing\nsomething productive,"},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"I can pretty well budget\nhow much I can get done"},"521":{"dur":0,"text":"on that flight."},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"It's kind of a system."},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"- That made me think of one\nof my favorite Dave things"},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"is in his training he said, you know,"},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"you talk about reading\nand personal development"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"and getting better, and you\nsay you don't have time,"},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"you're sitting on a toilet\nfor 15 minutes a day,"},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"you can read for 15 minutes a day."},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"Dave's really good at\ngetting rid of excuses."},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"- The older you get the\nmore books you should"},"542":{"dur":2,"text":"be able to read based on that."},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"It's crazy, if it's important\nto you you find a way,"},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"if it's not you'll find an excuse."},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"- You really do."},"552":{"dur":1,"text":"Gary and I were in a situation yesterday"},"554":{"dur":1,"text":"and we were--"},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"And I brought up, \"Well,\nyou got dressed today"},"558":{"dur":1,"text":"\"because it was important to you.\""},"559":{"dur":0,"text":"- That's right."},"560":{"dur":0,"text":"- It was a priority."},"561":{"dur":0,"text":"- That's right."},"562":{"dur":1,"text":"- You didn't come in naked"},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"so these things need to be a priority too,"},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's just focus is what it is."},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"- It's amazing how\nlittle time people spend"},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"working on their mindset every day."},"572":{"dur":0,"text":"- Yeah."},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"- I was with a group, we\nhad a thousand people,"},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"I was giving a speech,\ngood, high energy group,"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"and you ask the question,\n\"How much time do you spend"},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"\"every morning, preferably in the morning"},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"\"before your head gets screwed up,"},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"\"working on your mindset?"},"584":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Doing something to build your

your\nspiritual beliefs are,"},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"\"maybe reading something,\nmeditating, praying."},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"\"What do you do early in the day"},"597":{"dur":1,"text":"\"to build your mindset?\""},"599":{"dur":1,"text":"And the question's mostly nothing."},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"People leave their mindset up for grabs."},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"Now they may have talent,\nthey may have knowledge,"},"605":{"dur":1,"text":"but if the mindset's not right,"},"607":{"dur":1,"text":"if you're not really\ndialed in and focused,"},"609":{"dur":1,"text":"that stuff's not going to be leveraged."},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not going to be maximized."},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"And so you've got to make\ntime to work on the mindset,"},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't care what your position is."},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's part of what reading is about,"},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"staying fresh, staying\nrelevant, staying energized,"},"621":{"dur":1,"text":"and I like it early in the day."},"622":{"dur":1,"text":"Because I like to burst into the day,"},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't like to start the day in neutral."},"626":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't watch a lot of

it."},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't want to be ignorant\nof what's going on,"},"637":{"dur":1,"text":"but I don't want to be\nrehearsing that nonsense,"},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"that garbage, those

productive."},"646":{"dur":1,"text":"You've got to work on mindset."},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"Most people don't, it's\na great edge if you do."},"650":{"dur":1,"text":"- So you probably find it impossible then"},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"to watch the Cowboys\nthe last couple seasons."},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"You don't want that bad news."},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"- It's excruciating."},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"Here's how you watch the\nCowboys the last couple years,"},"660":{"dur":1,"text":"straight bourbon."},"661":{"dur":0,"text":"(laughter)"},"662":{"dur":0,"text":"- And not the cheap stuff."},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"Willett, 24 years old."},"666":{"dur":1,"text":"- So for everybody listening

job."},"685":{"dur":0,"text":"- He's over his head."},"686":{"dur":0,"text":"- Yeah."},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"- It was pretty obvious the first year."},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"- It was."},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"So are you a Seattle fan?"},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"- Oh yeah, well I grew up up there"},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"so I was born a Seahawks fan, I'm not,"},"695":{"dur":1,"text":"it's not a new thing."},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"- You've had a better\nrun than we have lately."},"699":{"dur":1,"text":"- He's a Seattle

too."},"705":{"dur":1,"text":"And we lost our basketball team,"},"707":{"dur":3,"text":"so the Sonics are now\nthe Oklahoma Thunder."},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah, it's a sad thing being--"},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean I think the Browns\nfans probably have it worse"},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"because the Seahawks did turn it around"},"717":{"dur":1,"text":"and we have a good

huge--"},"723":{"dur":1,"text":"I was a fan of Pete Carroll that he won,"},"725":{"dur":1,"text":"but I wasn't a huge fan of Pete Carroll"},"727":{"dur":1,"text":"until he went to the
