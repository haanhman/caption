were?"},"258":{"dur":2,"text":"They were Fibonacci numbers."},"261":{"dur":2,"text":"I can tell you that we\ncan do the same trick"},"263":{"dur":1,"text":"using Fibonacci numbers."},"265":{"dur":4,"text":"What I mean is, we can write\nevery number as a sum of"},"269":{"dur":2,"text":"Fibonacci numbers as well,\nlike we did with binary."},"271":{"dur":1,"text":"Let me

3."},"281":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's 8."},"283":{"dur":0,"text":"No, there's 5."},"284":{"dur":1,"text":"Get that right, James."},"285":{"dur":1,"text":"And then there's 8."},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"Then there's 13."},"289":{"dur":2,"text":"And 21?"},"291":{"dur":0,"text":"Shall I go up to 21?"},"292":{"dur":1,"text":"There we go."},"293":{"dur":1,"text":"Right."},"294":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, let's pick a number."},"296":{"dur":1,"text":"What shall we pick?"},"298":{"dur":0,"text":"JAMES GRIME: 19."},"299":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm going to pick\nthe number 19."},"302":{"dur":1,"text":"What do I need to make 19?"},"303":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's use the 13, because that's\nquite a big number."},"306":{"dur":1,"text":"And wow, 6 now."},"308":{"dur":2,"text":"So a 5 and a 1."},"310":{"dur":3,"text":"So I've written 1's to\nindicate what to use."},"313":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm going to write 0's\neverywhere else."},"317":{"dur":1,"text":"And again, it looks\nlike a binary sum."},"319":{"dur":1,"text":"It's looks like my binary\nis a binary sum."},"321":{"dur":4,"text":"It uses 1's and 0's, but this\ntime the 1's indicate which"},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"Fibonacci number to\nadd together."},"327":{"dur":3,"text":"Using this idea, you can make\nany number you want using"},"330":{"dur":1,"text":"Fibonacci numbers."},"332":{"dur":3,"text":"And if you don't use consecutive\nFibonacci numbers,"},"335":{"dur":1,"text":"so here I used a 5."},"337":{"dur":1,"text":"Now I could have used,\ninstead of 5, I could"},"339":{"dur":1,"text":"have done 2 and 3."},"340":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, if I don't use consecutive\nones, it's unique."},"344":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's only one\nway to do this."},"346":{"dur":3,"text":"So you can do this trick with\nFibonacci, but now I'm going"},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"to add an extra twist to this."},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"Because although I don't have\nthe cards for you, I'm afraid,"},"354":{"dur":4,"text":"you can do this trick again\nwith prime numbers."},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"Every number can be written\nas a sum of"},"361":{"dur":1,"text":"prime numbers, as well."},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'll show you how I made\nthose cards, then."},"369":{"dur":1,"text":"And then everyone\ncan make them."},"371":{"dur":1,"text":"Because you can make\nthem at home."},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'll use the powers\nof 2 card."},"374":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll show you how\nto make them."},"376":{"dur":3,"text":"And then if you learn this, you\ncan make your Fibonacci"},"380":{"dur":1,"text":"ones as well."},"381":{"dur":7,"text":"I started with the powers of\n2 in the top left corner."},"388":{"dur":1,"text":"Now I said, OK, I've got 1."},"390":{"dur":1,"text":"I've got 2."},"392":{"dur":1,"text":"3."},"393":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, to make three, it has to\nbe on this card and on this"},"397":{"dur":3,"text":"card, because those numbers\nadd up to 3."},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"So you write down\nyour 3 at that."},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"4 is here."},"404":{"dur":0,"text":"Great."},"405":{"dur":1,"text":"5."},"406":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, how do I make 5?"},"410":{"dur":1,"text":"1 and 4?"},"411":{"dur":4,"text":"So I have to write the 5 on\nthe 1 and the 4 card."},"415":{"dur":3,"text":"Then the 6, well,\nit's 4 and 2."},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"So I have to write the\n6 here and here."},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"So let's go back\nto Brady's 17."},"424":{"dur":3,"text":"As we know that 17 is, well,\nthink about the powers of 2."},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"16 plus 1 would do it."},"430":{"dur":5,"text":"And that's why I wrote 17 here\non the 16 card, and I wrote 17"},"436":{"dur":1,"text":"here on 1 card."},"437":{"dur":1,"text":"That's how I made them."},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, that fact that you can do\nit with Fibonacci numbers is"},"442":{"dur":1,"text":"not obvious."},"443":{"dur":1,"text":"It's called Zeckendorf's\ntheorem."},"444":{"dur":1,"text":"That's quite a cool name."},"446":{"dur":1,"text":"But it's actually misnamed."},"447":{"dur":4,"text":"The first guy who came up with\nthis was called Lekekeke, and"},"452":{"dur":0,"text":"that was his name."},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"That's fun that everyone\ncan enjoy."},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"Lekekeke."},"456":{"dur":4,"text":"The prime version of it is\nalso another surprise."},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"And altogether, if you want to\nknow how to do it in general,"},"463":{"dur":3,"text":"it's called Brown's Criterion."},"466":{"dur":1,"text":"These aren't the only\nsequences for"},"468":{"dur":0,"text":"which this works for."},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"But they're the pretty\ncool ones."}}
