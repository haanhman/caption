backyard."},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"And in the next, so you see what I'm saying, right,"},"289":{"dur":1,"text":"you have all these competing cities,"},"290":{"dur":3,"text":"so it takes a powerful leader with a unified law system"},"294":{"dur":2,"text":"to get these cities to unite,"},"296":{"dur":3,"text":"and nobody did it better than a guy named Pharaoh."},"300":{"dur":1,"text":"Pharaoh is the king of Egypt"},"301":{"dur":1,"text":"and he's put these laws into place,"},"303":{"dur":2,"text":"and the laws of all these ancient rulers"},"306":{"dur":1,"text":"are pretty much the

they do is,"},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"they go to the strongest nation on earth,"},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"a place where everyone has banded together"},"345":{"dur":3,"text":"and has resource, and that's the kingdom of Egypt."},"349":{"dur":1,"text":"And they go down there, and they live there,"},"351":{"dur":1,"text":"and their families start to populate,"},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"and for the next 450

river."},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"We're only gonna keep certain males alive"},"410":{"dur":4,"text":"so we keep the population in check."},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"So the job was to throw the babies in the river,"},"417":{"dur":1,"text":"so when Moses is born,"},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"his parents saw that he was special,"},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"saw that he was unique,"},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"and they refused to kill him,"},"425":{"dur":1,"text":"but they did follow the rules."},"426":{"dur":1,"text":"They put him in the river,"},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"but to protect him from the evils of the water,"},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"they put him an an ark that they made for him,"},"432":{"dur":2,"text":"a little basket, and then they asked his sister"},"434":{"dur":1,"text":"to stand on the riverbank"},"436":{"dur":2,"text":"and watch to make sure he was okay."},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"And so day after day, Moses' sister"},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"would go and look after Moses in the

she thinks the baby is special"},"451":{"dur":1,"text":"and she wants to keep the baby,"},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's when Moses' family steps up and goes,"},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Hey, if you guys need any free childcare,"},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"\"just come look in this direction.\""},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"So Moses is taken into the king's palace"},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"and he's raised as the son of Pharaoh."},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"He learns all the laws, he learns to read and write,"},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"and he actually begins experiencing a life"},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"of Egyptian privilege."},"472":{"dur":3,"text":"He's at the top of the social ladder."},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"It's almost like somebody said,"},"478":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Hey, let's take that kid from Oakland,"},"480":{"dur":1,"text":"\"give him a scholarship to USC"},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"\"and then let him live in Brentwood for a few years,"},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"\"and then he'll just be okay

person,"},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"and Moses recognizes the privilege that he has,"},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"and when he comes to understand"},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"that he, himself, is also a Hebrew,"},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"he steps in to do something about it."},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"He sees an Egyptian abusing an Israelite"},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"and he kills the Egyptian,"},"506":{"dur":1,"text":"and then he's got to flee."},"508":{"dur":1,"text":"The Bible says that he runs into the desert,"},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"and he lives there for the next 40 years,"},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"terrified of what would happen"},"512":{"dur":3,"text":"if Pharaoh found out about it."},"515":{"dur":0,"text":"So for the next 40 years,"},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"he gets married, he becomes a shepherd,"},"518":{"dur":4,"text":"and he's content to live far, far from Egypt."},"523":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's when the Bible says"},"525":{"dur":3,"text":"Moses sees this bush burning on a mountain,"},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"and he goes up to investigate"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"why the fire isn't spreading from bush to bush,"},"532":{"dur":1,"text":"and he sees that the bush is burning,"},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"but it's not being consumed by the flames,"},"535":{"dur":1,"text":"and from the midst of that bush,"},"537":{"dur":1,"text":"the Bible says the same

Abraham,"},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"the same God we worship today,"},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"speaks to Moses."},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"He says, \"Moses, I have a job for you."},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"\"You can't just stand by and do nothing."},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"\"I'm calling you to go and set my people free,"},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"\"and return them to the land

this?\""},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"God says, \"No, you're gonna do it.\""},"568":{"dur":1,"text":"And he says, \"Why will they even listen to me"},"569":{"dur":1,"text":"\"or believe me?\""},"570":{"dur":1,"text":"God says, \"What do you have in your hand?\""},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"And Moses says, \"Well, I have this staff.\""},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"God says, \"Throw it on the

says,"},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Pick it up.\""},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, in between throwing it on the ground"},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"and it hitting the ground, it's become a snake."},"587":{"dur":3,"text":"And now Moses is being asked to pick up this snake."},"590":{"dur":1,"text":"So Moses picks up the snake,"},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"and it turns back into the

people to go"},"606":{"dur":1,"text":"because he's got a real sweet gig"},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"oppressing this group of people."},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"So there's this showdown, right,"},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"between the person who believes that he is god on earth,"},"615":{"dur":5,"text":"whose laws everyone is subject to,"},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"and the real, one true

of Egypt,"},"630":{"dur":1,"text":"and Pharaoh lets the people go,"},"632":{"dur":1,"text":"and so they split, right, they get outta town,"},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"and on their way to the promised land,"},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"they come up against the Red Sea,"},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"and on their way up against the Red Sea,"},"638":{"dur":1,"text":"Pharaoh says, \"I'm gonna punish them"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"\"and teach them for humiliating me.\""},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"He gets his whole army"},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"and he goes out to destroy

and as they run through"},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"to the other side, Pharaoh and his army pursue them"},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"and as soon as Pharaoh gets into the middle,"},"670":{"dur":3,"text":"God closes them and destroys them with the water."},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"So God preserves Moses through the waters, yet again,"},"675":{"dur":1,"text":"and the people are on the other side,"},"677":{"dur":1,"text":"and they go up to Mount Sinai"},"678":{"dur":1,"text":"and God gives them his commandments,"},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"and now Moses is their law giver,"},"683":{"dur":1,"text":"he's the powerful leader in charge,"},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"and he gives them a law, and God's law"},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"is unique and it's special because it gives

starts with water, right?"},"726":{"dur":1,"text":"The Bible says that in the middle of the wilderness,"},"727":{"dur":1,"text":"they run out of water, and so they look at
