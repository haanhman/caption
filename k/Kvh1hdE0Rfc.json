sort of, not a North Korea,"},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"but it had been a socialist state that had been locked down."},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"So they opened it up."},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"They were not

away"},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"from socialism, privatizing industry, selling it off."},"452":{"dur":3,"text":"Now a lot of that as done with a high level of corruption."},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"The people around Assad were getting lots"},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"of those industries."},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"So they were getting rich, and what you saw"},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"is a crony capitalism

Yes."},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"There is a lot of economic injustice, but there was a lot"},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"of political injustice too."},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"The regime had ruled with an iron

times."},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"Ultimately they got slapped around, and someone"},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"said are you going to be a traitor?"},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"Do we have to - ?"},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"They threaten you, and if you continue to make trouble"},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"they\u2019ll put you in a dungeon, and they\u2019ll torture you!"},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"And, you know, people disappeared into that gulag."},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"Davis-Undiano: Would it be fair to say that during"},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"the period you\u2019re talking about now there was a kind"},"568":{"dur":1,"text":"of al-Assad two."},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"That is to say, he\u2019s somebody responding to the Sunni"},"573":{"dur":3,"text":"rebel groups and is a budding civil war, but he hasn\u2019t"},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"clearly emerged as the really repressing people"},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"who\u2019s going to use cluster bombs and everything else"},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"that we see later."},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"It is kind of an interim, isn\u2019t it? Or?"},"587":{"dur":1,"text":"Landis: Absolutely."},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"And he was a young na\u00efve guy."},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"He had been brought up with a silver spoon in his

people."},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"Bashar was brought up in a palace."},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"The guy had had everything he ever wanted"},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"with private tutors and so forth."},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"So he didn\u2019t have a clue, really, how people were suffering."},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"And he had never used force himself; it wasn\u2019t"},"612":{"dur":4,"text":"until this uprising was sparked that he had to make"},"617":{"dur":1,"text":"all these decisions and learn to be brutal."},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"Davis-Undiano: Get hardened."},"621":{"dur":1,"text":"Landis: And get hardened."},"622":{"dur":1,"text":"And the people around him, he still had lots of generals"},"624":{"dur":3,"text":"and other people who had been in his father\u2019s age"},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"who had been working in those torture chambers."},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"So they were saying this is explosive."},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"They had been dealing with jihadists who were"},"635":{"dur":4,"text":"traveling through Syria to go to Iraq to fight Americans."},"640":{"dur":3,"text":"There were tons of \u2013 you know they were taking down"},"643":{"dur":4,"text":"\u2013 the security people said we were taking down cells"},"647":{"dur":3,"text":"of jihadists, you know, every month."},"650":{"dur":3,"text":"We knew what the potential was."},"653":{"dur":4,"text":"Once the uprising started, they all saw jihadists taking over."},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"Davis-Undiano: And once the uprising got \u2013 really"},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"got started it looked like the insurgents at one point could"},"664":{"dur":2,"text":"succeed, or at least make a lot of progress, right?"},"667":{"dur":1,"text":"Landis: Yes, they did."},"668":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, and when the demonstration started there"},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"were, of course, peaceful demonstrations."},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"Everybody in Syria wanted change."},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"All they had known was 40 years of dictatorship"},"676":{"dur":1,"text":"under the Assads."},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"Everybody wanted change: Christians, Alawites,"},"680":{"dur":1,"text":"you name it."},"681":{"dur":3,"text":"Of course people, older people were very fearful."},"685":{"dur":3,"text":"They had been through periods of coup d'\u00e9tats"},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"and a lot of political change and turmoil in Syria previously."},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"So the regime immediately braced itself, and the people"},"693":{"dur":9,"text":"who had been doing all the secret repression,"},"703":{"dur":5,"text":"they know, or they believed, this is going to turn"},"708":{"dur":3,"text":"into a sectarian bloodbath overnight."},"711":{"dur":1,"text":"There are going to be jihadists who come"},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"in from all over the place."},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"The average young person who is 25 had never"},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"known real sectarian violence or anything,"},"719":{"dur":1,"text":"he just wanted change."},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"They wanted to get rid of Assad, have elections,"},"723":{"dur":3,"text":"or have something new, and have justice."},"726":{"dur":3,"text":"They didn\u2019t know how."},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"Most people were very politically na\u00efve."},"732":{"dur":3,"text":"So those demonstrations, the government at first"},"736":{"dur":4,"text":"didn\u2019t know what to do with them."},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"Tried beating people with sticks, then they tried"},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"shooting a few demonstrators, seeing if they could"},"745":{"dur":3,"text":"scare them off, and things just got out of control very quickly."},"748":{"dur":6,"text":"And quite rapidly elements in Syrian society began to get"},"755":{"dur":3,"text":"armed, and there were already an \u2013 you know march 15"},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"the demonstration started."},"761":{"dur":3,"text":"By the middle of April there were ambushes by some"},"764":{"dur":3,"text":"militant groups that began to kill off (inaudible)"},"768":{"dur":1,"text":"and so forth."},"770":{"dur":3,"text":"But that came relatively slowly, but it spun out"},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"of control pretty quickly."},"775":{"dur":4,"text":"By the end of 2011 all kinds of militias were springing up."},"780":{"dur":1,"text":"What was called the Free Syrian Army, and people"},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"from neighborhoods began to gather, get guns,"},"784":{"dur":3,"text":"and form secret cells."},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"Davis-Undiano: Would it be fair to say that then"},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"there\u2019s a third al-Assad, a third period of his leadership,"},"792":{"dur":3,"text":"where he is just hardened and is willing to bomb hospitals,"},"796":{"dur":3,"text":"bomb schools, playgrounds, you know, whatever it"},"800":{"dur":3,"text":"takes to-to disrupt supply lines."},"803":{"dur":2,"text":"He doesn\u2019t care about the casualties and the civilians"},"806":{"dur":1,"text":"who are dying."},"808":{"dur":3,"text":"Is that the one that just runs up to the present"},"811":{"dur":1,"text":"or is there another Assad that we can see?"},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"Landis: Yes, no, that-that, you know by the end of 2011,"},"815":{"dur":3,"text":"after eight months, that\u2019s when he started using planes,"},"819":{"dur":1,"text":"for example."},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"There weren\u2019t any planes in bombing,"},"823":{"dur":1,"text":"that was so indiscriminate."},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"But as the military began to lose control of certain"},"827":{"dur":3,"text":"areas it was very difficult to go into those areas,"},"831":{"dur":4,"text":"into towns, because if you\u2019re going on the ground"},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"with guns, you\u2019re going into somebody else\u2019s territory,"},"838":{"dur":2,"text":"they can ambush you from buildings."},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"It\u2019s very bloody."},"842":{"dur":1,"text":"So you don\u2019t want to do that."},"844":{"dur":1,"text":"you don\u2019t want to get your army sacrificed."},"845":{"dur":2,"text":"So that\u2019s when the pressure is to bomb and to use airpower."},"848":{"dur":1,"text":"And American does the same thing; we don\u2019t"},"850":{"dur":1,"text":"want to put boots on the ground in Iraq or"},"851":{"dur":2,"text":"\u2013 we just want to bomb the crap out of people."},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"And that instinct is very powerful."},"855":{"dur":1,"text":"If you\u2019ve got an air force and they don\u2019t,"},"857":{"dur":2,"text":"why not use it?"},"859":{"dur":1,"text":"Because then you don\u2019t have your own soldiers"},"861":{"dur":2,"text":"getting killed, but of course, it means a lot"},"863":{"dur":1,"text":"of indiscriminate damage."},"865":{"dur":1,"text":"Davis-Undiano: And then the chemical weapons"},"866":{"dur":0,"text":"during that period too."},"867":{"dur":1,"text":"Landis: And then the chemical weapons."},"868":{"dur":1,"text":"You know things went out of control, but it showed"},"870":{"dur":1,"text":"the chemical weapon use was a demonstration"},"872":{"dur":5,"text":"of how quickly things could escalate."},"877":{"dur":1,"text":"And it worked."},"879":{"dur":1,"text":"And that\u2019s the, you know, that\u2019s the \u2013"},"880":{"dur":0,"text":"Davis-Undiano: It works."},"881":{"dur":1,"text":"Landis: horrifying thing --"},"882":{"dur":0,"text":"Davis-Undiano: Yea the horrifying thing is it works."},"883":{"dur":1,"text":"Landis: is that it does work."},"884":{"dur":3,"text":"You can be mean, and people get frightened,"},"887":{"dur":2,"text":"and Lao Tzu (Sun Tzu), you know all the war"},"890":{"dur":3,"text":"theorists say don\u2019t
