small."},"236":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm a designer and a developer,\nand I'm sitting here."},"239":{"dur":4,"text":"So anything that we can\nget out of Google Play"},"243":{"dur":3,"text":"game services that can eliminate\nsome of the overhead for us"},"247":{"dur":2,"text":"is really super important."},"249":{"dur":1,"text":"In particular, achievements\nis great for us,"},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"because our games\nare not multiplayer,"},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"and it really helps\nengagement a lot."},"256":{"dur":1,"text":"And yeah, it's been\na great experience."},"260":{"dur":1,"text":"GUILHERME LACHAUT: Thank you."},"261":{"dur":1,"text":"So hello everyone."},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"Talking about\nGameloft, so Dan

multiplayer\nand Cloud Saver,"},"270":{"dur":2,"text":"we're using our own system."},"272":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're mainly using\nachievements and leader boards"},"274":{"dur":0,"text":"in our games."},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"And I would say that when\nit comes to achievements,"},"277":{"dur":4,"text":"this is where we've seen\nthe highest engagement."},"281":{"dur":1,"text":"Most of our games\nnow are free to play."},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"And when you're\ntalking about users,"},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"you first have user acquisition."},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"But then engagement and\nretention is really important."},"290":{"dur":3,"text":"And so achievements have\nachieved to bring competition,"},"293":{"dur":1,"text":"and I think also the\nfact that now there's"},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"game profiles into the\nmain [INAUDIBLE] map"},"298":{"dur":1,"text":"is very interesting,\nbecause we think"},"300":{"dur":2,"text":"it's going to continue this\ntrend of having people compete"},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"for the games and being able\nto see what their friends are"},"304":{"dur":0,"text":"doing."},"305":{"dur":1,"text":"DAN GALPIN: I

attending"},"312":{"dur":1,"text":"haven't played it\nyet, you should."},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"Partially just because there\nare a lot of achievement"},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"points to be had, and I

biggest\nby far is probably"},"333":{"dur":2,"text":"the multiplayer and\nthe game services."},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"When we first released\n\"PBA Bowling Challenge\","},"338":{"dur":3,"text":"it didn't have the\nmultiplayer mode."},"341":{"dur":3,"text":"We quickly started getting a\nlot of fans, a lot of users."},"344":{"dur":1,"text":"And it was really\ntough to keep up"},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"with enough content\nfor all those users."},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"They kept on coming back\nasking for more alleys and more"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"things unlocked,\nmore achievements."},"354":{"dur":1,"text":"By adding multiplayer,\nthat really"},"356":{"dur":3,"text":"opened up to where people\nwould play forever."},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"They could play random\npeople, their friends."},"362":{"dur":1,"text":"And each game was\na little different."},"363":{"dur":1,"text":"It was kind of funny,\nhaving it be real time."},"365":{"dur":2,"text":"We were actually looking\nfor an asynchronous type"},"367":{"dur":0,"text":"of a multiplayer."},"368":{"dur":1,"text":"And real time has\nbeen fantastic,"},"370":{"dur":3,"text":"because it's actually exciting\nto watch the other player"},"373":{"dur":1,"text":"roll through the\ndifferent bowling balls"},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"and kind of see, oh,\nhey, look at that one."},"376":{"dur":0,"text":"Oh!"},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"They used this ball."},"378":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's really been\ngreat for engagement."},"381":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can see our\nusers talk about it a lot"},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"and talk about how they\nplay against each other."},"389":{"dur":1,"text":"LLOYD TULLUES: So\nwe've been focusing"},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"much more on achievements\nand leader boards"},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"through a great\nmany of our games."},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"And we've already seen\na tremendous amount"},"398":{"dur":1,"text":"of value out of that."},"399":{"dur":3,"text":"Mainly because it's\na seamless experience"},"403":{"dur":3,"text":"and a consistent experience\nfor users across our games."},"406":{"dur":1,"text":"But if we step\nback a little bit,"},"408":{"dur":3,"text":"the most valuable feature we've\ngotten out of game services"},"411":{"dur":4,"text":"is just having a\nsingle sign on identity"},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"that follows the user\nbetween older devices."},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"So your achievements\nfollow you on your phone"},"422":{"dur":3,"text":"versus your tablet, now on\nyour television and so on."},"425":{"dur":3,"text":"And just having that\nexperience across all of those"},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"devices has been fantastic."},"431":{"dur":0,"text":"DAN GALPIN: Yeah."},"432":{"dur":2,"text":"For everyone who is\non the Android team,"},"435":{"dur":3,"text":"we pretty much won't\nplay a game unless it"},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"has some sort of\nCloud Save feature."},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"Because we're always\nreflashing devices,"},"442":{"dur":1,"text":"things are in development,\nwe're testing,"},"444":{"dur":1,"text":"we're moving from\ndevice to device."},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"Most of us have at least\na tablet and a phone."},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"And we want to play\non the best device"},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"that we happen to\nhave at a time."},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll tell someone,\nthis game is awesome!"},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"And they're like, does\nit have Cloud Save?"},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"That's the first\nquestion they'll ask me."},"457":{"dur":1,"text":"And so it really means a lot."},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think we're seeing more\nand more people out there"},"461":{"dur":3,"text":"in the community\nactually representing"},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"a very similar kind\nof demographic."},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"So the next question."},"470":{"dur":3,"text":"As we look into future launch\ntitles-- we're talking again,"},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"I know they're talking about\nPlay game services a lot here,"},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"but I'm hoping we can kind\nof stretch the topics out"},"478":{"dur":0,"text":"beyond this."},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"But if you look to\nlaunch future titles,"},"481":{"dur":1,"text":"how do you plan to\nleverage what we're"},"483":{"dur":1,"text":"doing in Play game services?"},"484":{"dur":1,"text":"SOURABH AHUJA: So\nwe're going to keep"},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"using what we do with the\n[? team ?] leaderboards, Cloud"},"488":{"dur":1,"text":"Save, retain those power users."},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"But the new features,\ngifting-- we just"},"492":{"dur":1,"text":"implemented it in\n\"Eternity Warriors 3\"."},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"We're experimenting\nwith that, made popular"},"496":{"dur":1,"text":"by \"Candy Crush\" of course."},"497":{"dur":4,"text":"But again, we get a free\nway of trying that system"},"502":{"dur":0,"text":"through GPGS."},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's happening."},"505":{"dur":4,"text":"We're actually putting in Quests\nand snapshots of saved games"},"509":{"dur":1,"text":"in \"RoboCup\" right now."},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"We're going live\nearly July, and we're"},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"excited to see how the\nmetrics of those pan out."},"516":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's the\ncurrent plan for GPGS."},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"DAN GALPIN: And it's OK."},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"The packaged name for\nsaved games is snapshots."},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"So if you're actually\nlooking at the API,"},"524":{"dur":1,"text":"that's what it looks like."},"525":{"dur":4,"text":"But the consumer\nname is saved games."},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"ARI KARDASIS: So\nour games tend to be"},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"somewhat one player\nat this point."},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"We're not really implementing\na lot of social stuff."},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think moving\nforward, not only"},"538":{"dur":1,"text":"are we interested in\ncompetitive gaming,"},"540":{"dur":1,"text":"but also collaborative gaming."},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"We had a game about a year ago\ncalled \"Say the Same Thing\","},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"which was a collaborative game."},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think we didn't\never quite figure out"},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"how to monopolize on that."},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think that Google\nPlay game services"},"553":{"dur":1,"text":"is the kind of thing\nwhere we can really"},"554":{"dur":1,"text":"get people to engage\nwith their friends,"},"556":{"dur":4,"text":"to work together to\nachieve things in games."},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"GUILHERME LACHAUT: I think\nwhen it comes to games,"},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"we're really working on bringing\nquality games-- HD triple"},"566":{"dur":0,"text":"A games."},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"But also on the\nsocial part of it."},"568":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think where Google\nPlay game services"},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"is really interesting\nis once again the leader"},"573":{"dur":3,"text":"boards, the achievements,\nand the new quests also"},"576":{"dur":1,"text":"is very interesting for us."},"577":{"dur":1,"text":"Because it's going to\nbring something new."},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"We wanted to bring something\nunique to the Android"},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"community, and this\nis a great way for us"},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"to continue launching it\nwith all our new games."},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"Implementing it all\nthe time, for us,"},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"is a great way to really keep\nit social, having sure everybody"},"591":{"dur":1,"text":"can see what their\nother friends are"},"593":{"dur":1,"text":"doing, what games\nthey're playing."},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"And for us, it's a\nkey strategy to have"},"597":{"dur":4,"text":"it implemented in most\nour upcoming tiles."},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"KEITH PICHELMAN:\nYeah, we'll certainly"},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"keep using all the Google\nPlay game services,"},"606":{"dur":1,"text":"they've been really\nvaluable so far."},"608":{"dur":3,"text":"I think we're most\nexcited about Quests."},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, we really look\nat Quests as being a way"},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"to have live events."},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"If you look at a lot of the\nbig games out there now,"},"617":{"dur":4,"text":"they have live events,\nshort events, longer events."},"622":{"dur":4,"text":"We're always looking at ways\nto keep our users engaged,"},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"keep the game with new content."},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"And by not having again to build\nnew alleys and tournaments all"},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"the time, we can\ndo a lot, I think,"},"635":{"dur":4,"text":"with Quests and\nmaking those events."},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"LLOYD TULLUES: So I'm going to\ngo back to my previous answer"},"643":{"dur":0,"text":"and build on that."},"644":{"dur":3,"text":"So when we are\nlooking at our users"},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"and realize that they\nhave multiple devices"},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"on different platforms,\nwe want to give them"},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"a consistent across\nall those devices."},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"So for, cloud saves\nare particularly--"},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"game saves are particularly\nexciting, especially"},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"with the new features\nthat are coming up,"},"661":{"dur":4,"text":"that we can leverage across\ndifferent device types as well"},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"as different platforms."},"668":{"dur":1,"text":"And so for us,\nthat's going to be"},"669":{"dur":5,"text":"a very exciting\nfeature to leverage."},"674":{"dur":1,"text":"And I wanted to make\nthe comment too,"},"676":{"dur":3,"text":"that it's interesting how\ngame services is almost"},"679":{"dur":1,"text":"becoming its own game platform."},"681":{"dur":3,"text":"We can start leveraging\nthe users in Google Play,"},"685":{"dur":2,"text":"as you guys are kind of\nputting that competitive nature"},"688":{"dur":4,"text":"against users that may\nnot even be friends."},"692":{"dur":3,"text":"And so as we build on\nachievements in leader boards,"},"695":{"dur":5,"text":"we can then leverage\nGoogle's competitive features"},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"and then keep engaging\nusers that way."},"703":{"dur":0,"text":"DAN GALPIN: Absolutely."},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'll say,\ncompletely, that part"},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"of the reason I went off\nand played \"I\/O Hunt\""},"709":{"dur":4,"text":"here is that I was trying\nto outdo Bob Meese's profile"},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"Bob Meese is the head of our\nbusiness development team here."},"716":{"dur":1,"text":"Point of honor."},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah, again, I think\nwhat's really exciting too"},"720":{"dur":2,"text":"is that we have the\nservices across to iOS."},"723":{"dur":4,"text":"We're launching actually\nboth saved games and Quests"},"728":{"dur":4,"text":"simultaneously for not just iOS,\nbut also our cross platform C++"},"732":{"dur":1,"text":"SDK."},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'm really excited\nabout giving

from\none device to another."},"745":{"dur":1,"text":"All right."},"747":{"dur":1,"text":"Feedback from players."},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"What do they say\nwhen you integrate"},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"this, when you\ndon't integrate it?"},"754":{"dur":1,"text":"Just kind of talk about it."},"755":{"dur":1,"text":"SOURABH AHUJA: So\nit's mostly positive."},"757":{"dur":2,"text":"People love the fact the\ncompetitive elements which"},"760":{"dur":3,"text":"were missing before, or were\nnot going from one device"},"763":{"dur":1,"text":"to another, so they like that."},"764":{"dur":4,"text":"There are some negatives, which\nit was just touched about."},"769":{"dur":2,"text":"Like lack of it being\na gamer network,"},"771":{"dur":5,"text":"where people struggle finding\ntheir friends any inviting them"},"776":{"dur":3,"text":"to play with because they're\nnot in the Google+ circles."},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"It's getting better, and I\nthink it will only get better"},"782":{"dur":4,"text":"if everybody in this room starts\nputting GPGS in their

with."},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"ARI KARDASIS: Well,\nI try to stay as far"},"797":{"dur":1,"text":"from customer service as I can."},"799":{"dur":3,"text":"But we really start\ngames with Google

has\nanything negative to say to us,"},"813":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's definitely\nhelpful for them."},"816":{"dur":1,"text":"GUILHERME LACHAUT: It's funny."},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"When it comes to

now, it's part\nof what users are expecting."},"850":{"dur":2,"text":"So we've never received\nany complaints about it,"},"852":{"dur":1,"text":"but I think it's\nreally something"},"854":{"dur":1,"text":"that now users\nare expecting when"},"855":{"dur":1,"text":"they're playing on their games."},"857":{"dur":3,"text":"So it really has become a\ntruthful gaming

everybody"},"1038":{"dur":2,"text":"is starting to put\nit in, I'm hoping"},"1040":{"dur":2,"text":"that you guys have enough data."},"1042":{"dur":5,"text":"So one of the challenges is\nacquiring the

your\nuser acquisition campaigns,"},"1095":{"dur":2,"text":"which we're already\nstarting to look into today."},"1098":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think all that\nstuff is very

like demographics\nand analytics,"},"1125":{"dur":1,"text":"I didn't really\nknow that existed."},"1126":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think maybe\ncommunicating with us better,"},"1128":{"dur":3,"text":"to

Yeah."},"1135":{"dur":3,"text":"I think we talked a lot about\nthe Play analytics features,"},"1139":{"dur":1,"text":"and we actually\nannounced it at GDC."},"1140":{"dur":2,"text":"But we haven't gone\naround trumpeting it."},"1143":{"dur":2,"text":"And part of the reason\nwe didn't do that was it"},"1145":{"dur":1,"text":"wasn't quite done."},"1147":{"dur":1,"text":"We didn't integrate\ndemographic features"},"1148":{"dur":1,"text":"until a few months later."},"1150":{"dur":2,"text":"And we really felt that, when\nyou actually can not only

you can actually\nsee which demographics"},"1160":{"dur":1,"text":"you're resonating with."},"1161":{"dur":4,"text":"That just adds a lot of\nimportant data for our

Yeah."},"1222":{"dur":1,"text":"It's always a balance."},"1223":{"dur":3,"text":"I think at Google,\none of things that we"},"1226":{"dur":3,"text":"take incredibly\nseriously is privacy."},"1229":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's always\nmaking sure that we"},"1231":{"dur":2,"text":"give the best possible\nservice to our users"},"1234":{"dur":1,"text":"while making sure they\nhave

that balance that's\neven less obtrusive than we've"},"1244":{"dur":3,"text":"But I think that for us is\nalways going to be a challenge."},"1248":{"dur":0,"text":"KEITH PICHELMAN: Yeah."},"1249":{"dur":1,"text":"I can think of a couple things."},"1250":{"dur":3,"text":"One minor thing would just\nbe with our leader boards"},"1254":{"dur":2,"text":"in the bowling game."},"1256":{"dur":2,"text":"Most people, when they bowl,\nthey compare by average."},"1258":{"dur":4,"text":"So we'd love to be able to\nhave a leader board type"},"1262":{"dur":2,"text":"thing

down."},"1269":{"dur":1,"text":"And leader boards\nthat can go only up."},"1271":{"dur":1,"text":"But we actually don't\nhave the ability"},"1273":{"dur":1,"text":"to have an average like that."},"1274":{"dur":0,"text":"KEITH PICHELMAN:\nWhich would be great"},"1275":{"dur":1,"text":"if that really happened in\nbowling, if your average always"},"1277":{"dur":0,"text":"went up."},"1278":{"dur":1,"text":"DAN GALPIN: Yeah exactly."},"1279":{"dur":1,"text":"KEITH PICHELMAN:\nThe other thing--"},"1280":{"dur":1,"text":"DAN GALPIN: Peak average."},"1281":{"dur":2,"text":"KEITH PICHELMAN:\n--is multiplayer"},"1284":{"dur":3,"text":"was the biggest service we've\nadded that's really helped out"},"1287":{"dur":2,"text":"our games quite a bit."},"1290":{"dur":1,"text":"If we could add more to that."},"1291":{"dur":3,"text":"Like right now we have\nusers all over the board,"},"1294":{"dur":2,"text":"as far as experience."},"1297":{"dur":3,"text":"We've started out the game, we\nactually had a cap of level 99,"},"1300":{"dur":2,"text":"and people blew through\nthat immediately."},"1302":{"dur":2,"text":"And we raised it to--\nI don't know why-- 199."},"1305":{"dur":1,"text":"Of course that didn't\nlast very long."},"1307":{"dur":2,"text":"And now today, we\nhave a capital of 999."},"1309":{"dur":2,"text":"And people are\nhitting that as well."},"1312":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a challenge\nwhen we match up"},"1314":{"dur":2,"text":"players that are say, like,\nlevel 750 to somebody who's"},"1317":{"dur":1,"text":"level 10."},"1318":{"dur":1,"text":"It doesn't make sense\nat all, and they'll"},"1320":{"dur":1,"text":"drop out right away."},"1321":{"dur":2,"text":"It'd be nice if we\nhad something where"},"1323":{"dur":3,"text":"if somebody was trying to\nplay a game, they're level x,"},"1326":{"dur":2,"text":"it started from that level\nand kind grew out from there"},"1329":{"dur":1,"text":"to try to find somebody\nat least that's"},"1331":{"dur":1,"text":"closest to that\nlevel type of thing."},"1333":{"dur":1,"text":"Or maybe even that level."},"1334":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe it's how good they are."},"1335":{"dur":2,"text":"So maybe it's average or\nsomething like that as well."},"1338":{"dur":0,"text":"Or combination."},"1339":{"dur":3,"text":"So right now, you can\nsplit up game matching"},"1343":{"dur":2,"text":"by variables that are fixed."},"1345":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can say,\nnever match anyone"},"1347":{"dur":2,"text":"who's level 1 against\nsomeone who's level 999."},"1350":{"dur":2,"text":"But that means that\nyou could potentially"},"1352":{"dur":3,"text":"end up in a situation\nwhere no one gets matched."},"1355":{"dur":1,"text":"And so that's a challenge."},"1357":{"dur":1,"text":"I think for us,\nadding more variables"},"1358":{"dur":2,"text":"and making matchmaking\nsmarter is one of the things"},"1360":{"dur":2,"text":"that we really are\ntaking to heart"},"1363":{"dur":3,"text":"and are trying to\ndo going forward."},"1366":{"dur":3,"text":"LLOYD TULLUES: So I want to\nsecond the frictionless sign"},"1369":{"dur":1,"text":"in as well."},"1370":{"dur":2,"text":"Anything that gets our\nplayers into the game"},"1372":{"dur":3,"text":"and enjoying the content\nwithout wall to get through"},"1376":{"dur":1,"text":"is fantastic."},"1378":{"dur":3,"text":"But I also want to\nadd, for us, we've"},"1382":{"dur":3,"text":"got so many

studios"},"1400":{"dur":2,"text":"all vying for the\nsame priority, it"},"1403":{"dur":2,"text":"gets very, very\ndifficult very quickly."},"1405":{"dur":1,"text":"So what I would\nreally like to see"},"1407":{"dur":3,"text":"is automation tools, so that\nour game teams can actually"},"1410":{"dur":4,"text":"build tools into their pipeline\nso they can update

when we were\nfirst designing achievements,"},"1427":{"dur":2,"text":"we actually had an\ninternal debate."},"1429":{"dur":2,"text":"And there was one side that\nargued we should do everything"},"1431":{"dur":3,"text":"through XML and just have you\nupload things to the portal."},"1434":{"dur":1,"text":"And then the other\nside was like,"},"1436":{"dur":2,"text":"but that will make it\nreally confusing for people"},"1438":{"dur":0,"text":"who are starting out."},"1439":{"dur":1,"text":"And so I think\nwe're at that point"},"1440":{"dur":2,"text":"now where people understand\nwhat achievements are,"},"1443":{"dur":1,"text":"they understand\nwhat they contain."},"1444":{"dur":2,"text":"And now it's time to actually\njust simplify the process"},"1447":{"dur":2,"text":"and make it easier for everyone."},"1449":{"dur":0,"text":"LLOYD TULLUES: Sorry."},"1450":{"dur":2,"text":"Just one other thing I wanted to\nadd onto with our mini

saying,"},"1569":{"dur":1,"text":"which one actually\ndoes the best?"},"1570":{"dur":1,"text":"So I think that is hard."},"1572":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think that unfortunately,\nif you're allowing
