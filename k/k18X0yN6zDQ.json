{"8":{"dur":3,"text":"Hello, and welcome to the Morningstar series\n'Why Should I Invest with you?' I am Emma"},"11":{"dur":4,"text":"Wall and here with me today is Charlie Awdry,\nManager of the Henderson China Opportunities"},"16":{"dur":5,"text":"Fund. Hi, Charlie. Hi, Emma. So, usually you\nhave between 50 and 60 stocks in the fund."},"21":{"dur":4,"text":"But at the moment you are slightly below that,\nwhy is that? Yeah, we've been running around"},"25":{"dur":4,"text":"45 \u2013 at the moment we're 47 and it's really\na reflection of the more difficult economic"},"30":{"dur":4,"text":"circumstances in China. Really fewer companies\nare excelling in this environment and so we"},"35":{"dur":3,"text":"are really focusing on the very best. So,\nin some industries where we would have owned"},"39":{"dur":5,"text":"two operators, we now just own the best. And\nthis might change though this month because"},"44":{"dur":4,"text":"there is some regulation coming which should\nopen the sort of sphere of investible options?"},"48":{"dur":4,"text":"Yes. So, we have a Connect, the mutual market\naccess between Hong Kong and Shanghai and"},"53":{"dur":4,"text":"what this means is that foreign investors\nwill have easier access to Shanghai. So, we"},"57":{"dur":5,"text":"are all accelerating our research into mainland\ncompanies and yeah, I think over the next"},"63":{"dur":3,"text":"few months you will see some more stocks in\nthe fund because there are some actually quite"},"67":{"dur":5,"text":"interesting unique investment opportunities\nthere. And one of the questions perhaps investors"},"72":{"dur":5,"text":"might have is about corporate governance.\nSo, the Hong Kong market obviously used to"},"78":{"dur":6,"text":"be U.K. owned and with that that comes a more\nwestern-style stringent governance. Investing"},"84":{"dur":5,"text":"in Shanghai, are there more sort of opportunities\nto be caught out? It's certainly different."},"90":{"dur":3,"text":"I would say one of the things that investors\nlike about Hong Kong, as you said, is the"},"93":{"dur":6,"text":"old British rule, which actually gives I would\nsay fairer law courts. In China, of course,"},"100":{"dur":4,"text":"the Communist Party is above everything. So,\nthey could control the law courts. So, I think"},"104":{"dur":4,"text":"investors will feel more comfortable about\nbeing able to have redress in corporate governance"},"108":{"dur":4,"text":"issues in Hong Kong. In Shanghai, that's something\nthat we will have to get more comfortable"},"113":{"dur":4,"text":"with. But from our point of view, what it\nmeans is that we really elevate the assessment"},"117":{"dur":5,"text":"of quality and shareholder friendliness in\nour picks in that market. Having travelled"},"123":{"dur":4,"text":"a lot in China and met a lot of these Shanghai\ncompanies I would say the range of corporate"},"128":{"dur":5,"text":"governance is significantly broader than in\nHong Kong. There are the very best and there"},"133":{"dur":5,"text":"are a lot of poor ones. So, again, you have\nto be very selective. Looking at the companies"},"138":{"dur":4,"text":"that are going to be coming to the fore for\nyou guys, what kind of sectors is it? I mean,"},"142":{"dur":6,"text":"what's the market made up of? Well, in Shanghai,\nit's slightly different in that they have"},"149":{"dur":6,"text":"a lot of more industrial side, but they also\nhave a very long history of healthcare companies"},"155":{"dur":3,"text":"and healthcare is something that we've been\ninvesting in a lot in Hong Kong and we expect"},"159":{"dur":6,"text":"to do it in Shanghai as well. The healthcare\nsector for us is really attractive in China"},"165":{"dur":4,"text":"really because of demographics, you have a\nlot of aging people, they are also richer"},"169":{"dur":4,"text":"and the government is putting more plans through\nfor insurers and healthcare insurers. So,"},"174":{"dur":3,"text":"expenditure and budgets on healthcare are\ngrowing. So, the long-term outlook for that"},"177":{"dur":3,"text":"sector is pretty good. So, that's certainly\none area where we have invested in Hong Kong"},"181":{"dur":3,"text":"and we'll be looking in Shanghai as well.\nYou mentioned at the beginning one of the"},"184":{"dur":4,"text":"reasons why you are low on stocks at the moment\nis that macro outlook is not so great. Over"},"188":{"dur":4,"text":"the summer we had some disappointing figures\nfor GDP. How is that affecting your choices?"},"193":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, I'd say generally speaking there are\nsort of two elements to the portfolio. There"},"198":{"dur":5,"text":"is an element that is the best companies that\ncan deliver almost whatever the economy, so"},"204":{"dur":6,"text":"slightly less cyclical. And that's either\nbecause they a noncyclical business in China"},"210":{"dur":4,"text":"or they have a secular driver or they are\ninternational businesses. So, examples will"},"214":{"dur":5,"text":"be Tencent, which is an internet business;\nAIA, which is life insurance; or even Lenovo,"},"220":{"dur":5,"text":"which has a strong domestic PC position in\nChina and is taking market share internationally."},"225":{"dur":4,"text":"And then the other part of the portfolio is\nmore economically sensitive areas. Areas like"},"230":{"dur":5,"text":"financials, areas like industrials, which\ntend to trade more with macro data. So, I"},"236":{"dur":4,"text":"think what you are referring to maybe is the\nAugust PMI number was a little bit weaker."},"240":{"dur":3,"text":"And yes, we have that rally through the middle\nof the year and that tends to be when those"},"243":{"dur":4,"text":"financials and more sensitive stocks have\ngone up. So, I would say that sort of seems"},"247":{"dur":4,"text":"to how the different part of the portfolio\nthan the more structural drivers which make"},"252":{"dur":4,"text":"up the vast majority of the fund. And so,\nperhaps it's about tweaking as you get more"},"257":{"dur":5,"text":"information? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the pickup\nin the economy that we had this year started"},"262":{"dur":7,"text":"in about May time. What we had in 2012 and\n2013 is it started in September. So, really"},"269":{"dur":4,"text":"we've actually had an acceleration earlier\nin the year and so we are watching what happens"},"274":{"dur":5,"text":"from here and I think a lot of it depends\non the property sector. Charlie, thank you"},"279":{"dur":5,"text":"very much. Thank you. This is Emma Wall for\nMorningstar. Thank you for watching."}}
