you're at the other\nend of the spectrum"},"265":{"dur":1,"text":"and you're a large\nenterprise, and we're"},"267":{"dur":2,"text":"talking about large\nenterprises here today,"},"270":{"dur":1,"text":"then I think one of\nthe biggest challenges"},"272":{"dur":2,"text":"is the legacy that you have."},"274":{"dur":3,"text":"You've invested a ton of\nmoney over many years,"},"277":{"dur":3,"text":"maybe decades, in ERP systems,\naccounting systems, sales"},"281":{"dur":1,"text":"and marketing\nsystems, and so on."},"283":{"dur":3,"text":"And the attraction, sort\nof historical practice,"},"286":{"dur":4,"text":"is to continue to incrementally\nupgrade those systems, when"},"290":{"dur":2,"text":"in fact you can be spending\nmost of your time and effort"},"293":{"dur":2,"text":"as a company on preserving\nyour legacy as opposed"},"296":{"dur":0,"text":"to innovating."},"297":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think sort of\nGuy talked about it"},"298":{"dur":3,"text":"before, you know, this\nnotion that sort of perfect"},"302":{"dur":1,"text":"is the enemy of done."},"303":{"dur":1,"text":"The Reid Hoffman\nquote what I thought"},"305":{"dur":2,"text":"was really quite powerful."},"307":{"dur":4,"text":"And so that sort of sits very\nuncomfortably within IT teams"},"312":{"dur":1,"text":"and within large enterprises."},"313":{"dur":3,"text":"And so being able to be\ninnovative in an environment"},"317":{"dur":2,"text":"where you've got a legacy I\nthink is really challenging."},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"And sometimes you just\nhave to make bold decisions"},"322":{"dur":1,"text":"and burn the boats on\nsome things as well,"},"323":{"dur":1,"text":"and we've heard a\ncouple of examples"},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"that this morning John talked\nabout it with their Google"},"328":{"dur":1,"text":"implementation."},"330":{"dur":4,"text":"So for us, when I\njoined Salmat, we"},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"had done a lot of things\nover a decade or so."},"337":{"dur":3,"text":"We'd made a number\nof acquisitions."},"340":{"dur":2,"text":"We had had a lot of\ncustomer facing systems,"},"343":{"dur":3,"text":"and we had systematically bolted\ndown our infrastructure piece"},"346":{"dur":3,"text":"by piece by piece to make\nit as secure as it could be,"},"350":{"dur":2,"text":"right down to the lowest\ncommon denominator."},"352":{"dur":1,"text":"And then an\nunintended consequence"},"353":{"dur":2,"text":"of that, a decade later, was\nwe couldn't get anything done."},"356":{"dur":3,"text":"We were so glued up that\nwe needed dramatic change."},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"And when we looked\nat collaboration"},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"as a really important\naspect of our business,"},"365":{"dur":3,"text":"we have operations across\nevery major city in Australia,"},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"in New Zealand,\nPhilippines and Sri Lanka."},"371":{"dur":1,"text":"Just getting our\npeople to talk to each"},"373":{"dur":3,"text":"other was really\ndifficult. And so we"},"376":{"dur":1,"text":"made what was a bold\ndecision at the time."},"378":{"dur":3,"text":"And I've grown up inside\nthe Microsoft ecosystem."},"382":{"dur":3,"text":"To shift ecosystems to\nthe Google platform,"},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"we looked at what our\ncustomers, our partners,"},"388":{"dur":1,"text":"and the industry in\nwhich we operate,"},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"which is sort of media\nand digital marketing,"},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"and most of the development\nand innovation that"},"394":{"dur":1,"text":"was taking place\nin that world was"},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"happening on iOS and Android."},"398":{"dur":3,"text":"So we sort of stepped back,\ntook an ecosystem view,"},"401":{"dur":1,"text":"and made the leap."},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's been a\nfantastic decision"},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"with the benefit of hindsight."},"405":{"dur":1,"text":"It was a bit scary at the time."},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think those\nsorts of things,"},"410":{"dur":3,"text":"being able to respect\nyour legacy but understand"},"414":{"dur":1,"text":"that there may be a\ntime where you need"},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"to draw a line in the sand\nand move away from it,"},"418":{"dur":1,"text":"is one of the biggest\nchallenges that I"},"420":{"dur":3,"text":"see for major\nAustralian enterprises."},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"Trent, I'm going\nto now go to you."},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"If you think about some of\nthe benefits that you've seen,"},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"just if you could share with\nus some of the above and beyond"},"431":{"dur":1,"text":"benefits that you've\nseen that were"},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"far beyond your expectations\naround the Google Apps products"},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"that you haven't experienced\nwhen using other technologies."},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"TRENT INNES: So I might\nstart with a little bit"},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"of my background."},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"So I mentioned before I've been\nat Xero for three years now."},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"Before that I actually spent\nquite a number of years"},"446":{"dur":3,"text":"So I was well and truly wedded\nto the Microsoft platform."},"450":{"dur":3,"text":"So not long after\nI started at Xero,"},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"I remember a notification\ncoming out saying,"},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"we're moving to Google Apps."},"456":{"dur":3,"text":"And I broke into a cold\nsweat, because I am literally"},"460":{"dur":3,"text":"through and through a power\nExcel user, number one,"},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"and definitely a power Outlook\nuser at that point in time."},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"And I thought there's no way now\nI can change, started to panic."},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"Surely we're just moving\nto a cheaper system."},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"That's what I thought\nto start with."},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"It's going to be an\ninferior solution."},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"What I failed to realize\nat that point in time,"},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"that it wasn't actually so\nmuch about the key functions"},"481":{"dur":1,"text":"that the product's used to do."},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"It's actually about\nthe way that you work."},"484":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's about the\nway that people"},"485":{"dur":1,"text":"interact with each other."},"487":{"dur":1,"text":"So I think the biggest\nbenefit that we unlocked,"},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"as I look back at\nthat, is we actually"},"490":{"dur":3,"text":"extracted far more productivity\nand ideas out of our people."},"493":{"dur":3,"text":"And the reason for that is the\ncollaboration in real time."},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"I just didn't have\nmy head around that."},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"Until you've actually\nstarted seeing that working"},"500":{"dur":3,"text":"in an enterprise environment,\nyou can't appreciate it."},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"So we can be working on-- I\nsaw some demos earlier today,"},"506":{"dur":1,"text":"and that kind of\nshows a bit of it,"},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"but you have to actually\nget in there and do it."},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"We can be working on a\ndocument in real time."},"513":{"dur":1,"text":"We can all see\neach other working."},"514":{"dur":1,"text":"All the ideas are coming out."},"516":{"dur":1,"text":"We're all truly\nfocused on solving"},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"that problem at that point\nin time, whereas historically"},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"what you used to do was\nyou'd put it in a document,"},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"you'd attach it to an\nemail, then in the email"},"524":{"dur":1,"text":"you'd explain what the\ndocument was about."},"526":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm sure everyone--\nwho's done that?"},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"Lots of people, I'm sure."},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"Yep, lots of hands going up."},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"Then you send that out."},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"They then open that later,\nat some point in time."},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"They'll make some changes."},"535":{"dur":1,"text":"They'll put Track Changes on."},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"They'll send it back the\nother way, and time goes by,"},"539":{"dur":1,"text":"and all of a sudden,\nyou know, what"},"541":{"dur":1,"text":"could have been quite a simple\nproblem that you could've"},"542":{"dur":2,"text":"solved in 10 minutes if you\nwere collaborating together"},"544":{"dur":3,"text":"is suddenly drawn out to\n24, 48 hours and beyond."},"548":{"dur":0,"text":"That's the key thing."},"549":{"dur":1,"text":"And the great thing\nis when you start"},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"doing that across\nboundaries, you"},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"start to get far\nbetter ideas and solve"},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"problems much quicker than\nyou ever could have imagined."},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"RENEE GAMBLE: Well, just\non that thread, maybe"},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll open up to all three\nof you, if you wanted just"},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"to mention, what\ndo you-- for you,"},"562":{"dur":1,"text":"what have been some\nof the greatest"},"564":{"dur":3,"text":"differentiators on the Google\nplatform in your experience,"},"568":{"dur":1,"text":"in your own organizations?"},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"ANDREW KNEEBONE:\nYeah, to the point,"},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"you're absolutely correct."},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"We had the same problem."},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"When we pitched\nGoogle and I stood up"},"579":{"dur":3,"text":"in front of the executives,\nit was a bit of a hard sell."},"582":{"dur":1,"text":"Firstly, I had to\nsay that the problems"},"584":{"dur":1,"text":"that we're facing\nin our organization,"},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'm sorry, the\ndirectors, you don't face it,"},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"because it's the people that\nwork for you that face it."},"590":{"dur":1,"text":"You'll get the email."},"591":{"dur":1,"text":"You'll get the final product."},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"But you won't to see\nhow the sausage is made."},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"Their heads are just down, you\nknow, for days and days on end."},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"And that simple paradigm\nof taking one spreadsheet,"},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"emailing it to three people,\nasking them to enter something"},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"in, emailing it back to\nyou, and then spending"},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"the rest of the afternoon\nre-entering the bits that they"},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"entered in, is broken."},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"It really is."},"614":{"dur":3,"text":"And in the modern era, now\nwith the Google Sheets,"},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"that's ease of use."},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"That's simple ease of use with\ninside our organization went"},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"viral, because at\nthe end of the day,"},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"we have a finite amount of time."},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"It seems we get a little\nless every year, as far"},"629":{"dur":1,"text":"as the expendable time we have."},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"And the ability to take\nsomething that would normally"},"633":{"dur":3,"text":"take an hour-- days, even,\nbecause you've sent it out"},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"and you're waiting for\nit back-- you now go, no."},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"Meeting, get in, everyone do\ntheir bits, and you're out."},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's the biggest change."},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"And I really expected that I'd\nhave to push that quite hard,"},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"but once it got\nrolling, it got rolling."},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"And we have people\nacross the entire world"},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"with inside of Visy\nindustries that do that now."},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"RENEE GAMBLE: Thanks."},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"CRAIG DOWER: For us it's\nbeen a really important part"},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"of our transformation."},"659":{"dur":4,"text":"We had about 28 different\nlines of products and services"},"664":{"dur":2,"text":"which were all sort of\nindependent PNLs, which"},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"would be fine in a business\nthat was the size of GE,"},"669":{"dur":1,"text":"but we're a $500\nmillion business,"},"670":{"dur":1,"text":"and so there was a\nlot of stuff in there"},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"that wasn't all that effective."},"673":{"dur":3,"text":"We've cut that back to about\nsix or eight things that we do."},"676":{"dur":1,"text":"But what we're most\nimportantly trying to do"},"678":{"dur":1,"text":"is get our teams\nworking together"},"680":{"dur":1,"text":"so we get our
