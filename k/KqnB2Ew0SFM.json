All"},"246":{"dur":3,"text":"right. Here's -- here's the first point. This\nis true"},"250":{"dur":3,"text":"for everybody and most of us, including me,\ndon't think"},"253":{"dur":5,"text":"about this. If you -- as a leader, the first\nthing I"},"258":{"dur":3,"text":"would argue you need to think about and for\neach of you"},"261":{"dur":3,"text":"what is your aspiration? What is your vision?\nWhat is"},"265":{"dur":3,"text":"it you want to accomplish? Now, let me just\nask you,"},"268":{"dur":4,"text":"how many here in this room have a vision for\nthemselves,"},"272":{"dur":3,"text":"for their business, for the project they're\nworking on?"},"276":{"dur":5,"text":"Okay. That's a -- that's great. A lot of people\ndon't"},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"think about what their vision is. And let\nme just say"},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"to you, there's two things I talk to leaders\nabout."},"287":{"dur":3,"text":"Number one, can you write down on a piece\nof paper your"},"291":{"dur":3,"text":"aspiration? So all of you who raised your\nhand -- I'm"},"294":{"dur":2,"text":"not going to call on you, don't worry -- but\ncan you"},"296":{"dur":9,"text":"write it down clearly? Okay. Number two, can\nyour"},"306":{"dur":3,"text":"people, the people that you're working with,\ncan they"},"309":{"dur":3,"text":"write it down? If I gave them a quiz, could\nthey write"},"313":{"dur":3,"text":"down the same vision that you just wrote down?\nHere's"},"317":{"dur":3,"text":"why this is important. First of all, I would\nargue that"},"320":{"dur":5,"text":"every successful business I've ever seen -- or\nnon-profit -- a lot of people think that successful"},"326":{"dur":4,"text":"businesses are because people are so shrewd,\nthat"},"330":{"dur":5,"text":"they're focused on how to make money, they're\ncommercially smart. Not really. They ultimately"},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"need\nto do those things, but those come way down"},"338":{"dur":3,"text":"the list.\nSuccessful, sustainable businesses that I've"},"342":{"dur":5,"text":"seen start\nwith a vision about how to serve a client,"},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"or make a\npositive impact on the world. And they're"},"349":{"dur":4,"text":"based on a\nclear distinctive competence. Now, I don't"},"354":{"dur":3,"text":"need to tell\nyou this because at Google [chuckles] you"},"357":{"dur":3,"text":"know this already. You\nfocus on this every day. But a lot of business"},"360":{"dur":3,"text":"leaders\ndon't, and a key to a successful project,"},"364":{"dur":4,"text":"leader, or\nleader at all, is to stay with that vision,"},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"or update it\nif you need to update it, but everything you"},"371":{"dur":3,"text":"do needs to\nrevolve around that, and the people you're"},"374":{"dur":4,"text":"working with\nneed to know what it is. Because it is very"},"378":{"dur":4,"text":"hard to\nmobilize people if they don't know your aspiration."},"383":{"dur":3,"text":"So\nto me the first thing you've got to do as"},"386":{"dur":6,"text":"a leader is\ncan you write it down clearly? Do you articulate"},"392":{"dur":1,"text":"it to\nthe people you're working with? You may not"},"394":{"dur":1,"text":"have people\nworking for you. You may not have people reporting"},"396":{"dur":1,"text":"to\nyou. The people working on your team, the"},"398":{"dur":4,"text":"people across\ndepartments, do you tell them what the vision"},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"is so\nyou're on the same page, and could they repeat"},"405":{"dur":4,"text":"it back?\nNow, I could argue -- I'll take an example."},"409":{"dur":3,"text":"Barack Obama\nwas elected President of the United States,"},"412":{"dur":4,"text":"in my opinion,\nin 2008 because he articulated a very clear"},"417":{"dur":4,"text":"vision for\nwhere he wanted to take the country. And to"},"421":{"dur":3,"text":"me that\nvision was not changed. That was mechanic."},"424":{"dur":4,"text":"It was\nunification. We're going to find a new way"},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"to do\nthings; we're all going to come together."},"431":{"dur":1,"text":"Some of you\nare too young, but you remember the speech"},"432":{"dur":3,"text":"that he gave\nat the 2004 convention: \"There's not a black"},"436":{"dur":1,"text":"American;\nnot a white American; not a rich American..."},"437":{"dur":3,"text":"there's\njust the United States of America.\" Visionary"},"441":{"dur":4,"text":"candidate. Very clear on what he wanted to\ndo. Very"},"445":{"dur":3,"text":"clear aspiration. You should ask yourself\n-- people ask"},"448":{"dur":4,"text":"gee, a lot of people accuse Obama today of\nnot being a"},"452":{"dur":4,"text":"strong leader. Why? And it takes a little\nthought, but"},"456":{"dur":3,"text":"for me, I think people are not clear on what\nhis vision"},"460":{"dur":4,"text":"is for lots of reasons, but it shows you how\nimportant"},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"it is if you're a project leader, if you're\nthe head of"},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"the household, or if you're the President\nof the United"},"470":{"dur":3,"text":"States, it starts with a clear vision. Okay?\nSo that's"},"474":{"dur":4,"text":"number one. By the way, these are questions.\nSo the"},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"reason I write these questions, if you're\nstruggling or"},"481":{"dur":3,"text":"you can't seem to mobilize your people, or\nyour unit"},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"isn't doing well and you're wondering why,\nwhat this is"},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"intended to be is keep five or six questions\non your"},"490":{"dur":3,"text":"wall. Maybe I'm not clear enough on the vision.\nMaybe"},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"the world has changed and I haven't changed\nthe vision."},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"Maybe I have a vision; I'm not repeating it\nenough and"},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"my people aren't clear. Maybe I'd better repeat\nit at"},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"the next meeting and that's the problem. So\nthis is"},"505":{"dur":4,"text":"like a pilot on a plane checklist of what\nmight be wrong"},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"when they're having engine trouble. This is\nnumber one"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"question. This is the cornerstone for me of\neverything"},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"you do. I teach at Harvard Business School.\nI want to"},"518":{"dur":3,"text":"be the best professor in the world. Okay?\nI do. It's"},"522":{"dur":3,"text":"pathetic, but I do. [laughter] That is my\ndream. It really is."},"526":{"dur":3,"text":"And everything I do is to try to -- we'll\nsee if I get"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"there, but that doesn't matter. At he's I\nknow what I'm"},"532":{"dur":3,"text":"trying to do and it has a powerful impact\non everything"},"536":{"dur":4,"text":"that I do. Okay. Now, once you have a vision,\nthere's"},"541":{"dur":3,"text":"one other thing that's got to go with it,\nand that is"},"544":{"dur":4,"text":"you have to pick three -- in my opinion three\nto five"},"549":{"dur":4,"text":"key tasks -- I call them priorities here,\nbut what I"},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"really mean, what are the most important things\nyou must"},"556":{"dur":6,"text":"do superbly well to achieve that vision? And\nsame"},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"question: Can you write them down? How many\nthink you"},"566":{"dur":6,"text":"could write down the top three? Okay. Interesting.\nNot as many. So you're clear on the vision,"},"573":{"dur":4,"text":"but not as\nclear on the priorities. And I would argue"},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"you've got\nto be clear on the priorities for one big"},"580":{"dur":4,"text":"reason, which\nI'm about to get to. How do you spend your"},"585":{"dur":3,"text":"time? How\nmany of you are working 70 hours a week; stressed"},"589":{"dur":3,"text":"out\nbecause you're working 70 hours a week? No?"},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"[chuckles] Sixty?\nAll the ones that are -- okay. Sixty. Fine."},"596":{"dur":3,"text":"Fifty.\nWhatever. But you're juggling a lot. Here's"},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"the point.\nWhen people are struggling on how to spend"},"603":{"dur":3,"text":"their time or\nI have a business leader or anyone come to"},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"me and say\n\"Oh, my God, I'm just juggling so many things"},"608":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't\nknow what to do. How do you do it? I'm just"},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"trying to\nsqueeze these things in.\" And by the way,"},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll say\nthem, \"Well, what's your vision for the business?\""},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"And\nthey say, \"Oh, Rob, I don't think about it."},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm just\ntoo busy.\" Okay. Well can you tell me your"},"618":{"dur":3,"text":"three to\nfive top priorities? \"Oh, Rob. The chaos of"},"621":{"dur":1,"text":"this\nbusiness I can't even think about it.\" And"},"623":{"dur":4,"text":"I go oy. I\nsay to them -- I go listen, the -- this is"},"627":{"dur":3,"text":"part of your\nproblem. Clear vision and then you've got"},"631":{"dur":3,"text":"to write down\nthree to five priorities. Now, some of you"},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"may say,\n\"Rob, you couldn't understand. We've got ten"},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"or fifteen\npriorities.\" I've had people say that to me"},"642":{"dur":3,"text":"and I would\nsay politely back, ten to fifteen priorities"},"646":{"dur":5,"text":"is the same\nas zero. Zero. That's zero. Okay? And why"},"651":{"dur":4,"text":"do I say\nthat? It's not that I don't have a to-do list"},"656":{"dur":3,"text":"of ten or\nfifteen things, but a human being, no matter"},"659":{"dur":4,"text":"how talented, at\nany one point, it's hard to really bore in"},"664":{"dur":5,"text":"on three, or\nfour, or five. And it's critical. The most"},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"important\nasset you have is your time. A lot of people"},"673":{"dur":3,"text":"think it's\nmoney, it's hard assets, it's all this other"},"677":{"dur":3,"text":"stuff. I\nbelieve strongly the most important asset"},"681":{"dur":4,"text":"all of you\nhave as leaders is your time. Yet many of"},"686":{"dur":4,"text":"us spend our\ntime in a very sloppy way. And one little"},"690":{"dur":3,"text":"rule I give\nfor people, pretend that this time was a big"},"694":{"dur":5,"text":"sum of money, a lot of money.\nWhatever's a lot of money to you. Pretend"},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"that you were\ngoing to think about how to spend it. I will"},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"bet you\njust looking at this group you don't just"},"704":{"dur":5,"text":"oh, here let's\nspend X-thousand here, X-thousand there. Who"},"709":{"dur":3,"text":"does that?\nNobody does it. You really think -- some of"},"712":{"dur":3,"text":"you really\nthink hard before you spend any of it. I would"},"716":{"dur":3,"text":"argue\nthe irony is, if you do that with your money,"},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"this is\nmore valuable I would argue even than your"},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"money, or\nit's the same thing. Why don't you do it the"},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"same way?\nAnd there's only one way that I know how."},"728":{"dur":3,"text":"You've got to\ndecide in advance what your top priorities"},"732":{"dur":5,"text":"are, and then\nyou've got to match your time with those priorities."},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"When I see a business leader, or a non-profit\nleader, or"},"740":{"dur":3,"text":"a project manager, you name it, who's having\ntrouble,"},"744":{"dur":5,"text":"invariably, lack of a clear vision or they've\ngot it but"},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"do not think about matching their time with\ntheir top"},"753":{"dur":3,"text":"priorities. Why? A, they just don't think\nabout it; B,"},"757":{"dur":2,"text":"they haven't written down their top three\nto five"},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"priorities. But I can tell you if you don't\nknow your"},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"top three to five priorities, I am pretty\ncertain you"},"765":{"dur":5,"text":"are poorly using your time because it takes\nenormous"},"770":{"dur":2,"text":"effort.

How"},"790":{"dur":4,"text":"many of you actually -- I won't even ask.\nI've got an"},"795":{"dur":3,"text":"idea. If you asked me how I spent my time\nthis last"},"798":{"dur":3,"text":"week, I would not have the slightest idea.\nHow many of"},"801":{"dur":3,"text":"you think you know? And how many of you don't\nknow?"},"805":{"dur":2,"text":"All right. How many of you got like a shoulder\nproblem"},"808":{"dur":1,"text":"or something?\n[Laughing]"},"809":{"dur":3,"text":">>Rob Kaplan: All right. Okay. We'll leave\nyou alone on that. You're eating lunch. But"},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"let me\ntell you something. The other advice I'd give"},"815":{"dur":3,"text":"you if\nyou're like me, go for a week and track how"},"818":{"dur":3,"text":"you spend\nyour time. It's annoying to do, but do it"},"822":{"dur":3,"text":"anyhow.\nTrack within chunks how you spend your time,"},"826":{"dur":2,"text":"and then\nwrite it down at the end of the week. Match"},"829":{"dur":4,"text":"those\nchunks with those top priorities and see how"},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"far off you\nare. Now, the one other thing if it helps"},"837":{"dur":2,"text":"-- I talk\nabout this in the book, and this is simple"},"840":{"dur":3,"text":"stuff. One\nof the things I've done for CEOs of large"},"843":{"dur":3,"text":"organizations\nall the way to, you know, just independent"},"847":{"dur":5,"text":"project\nmanagers is ask them to break their tasks,"},"852":{"dur":1,"text":"the things\nthey're spending time on, into ones, twos,"},"854":{"dur":3,"text":"and threes.\nOnes are things you've got to do. And I'm"},"857":{"dur":2,"text":"going to talk\nabout that in a moment. For example, I believe"},"860":{"dur":2,"text":"you've\ngot to decide on your vision of priorities."},"862":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're\nnot making time for that, you've got to do"},"865":{"dur":2,"text":"that. That's\na one. Then there's twos and threes. Twos"},"868":{"dur":3,"text":"are things\nyeah, maybe, maybe not; and threes are things"},"871":{"dur":3,"text":"you\nabsolutely should not be doing. There's no"},"875":{"dur":2,"text":"--\nthere's -- I've talked to CEOs who are still"},"878":{"dur":4,"text":"approving\nexpenses down to blank-thousand dollars. Why?"},"882":{"dur":2,"text":"Well,\nit's just what we've always done. How many"},"885":{"dur":3,"text":"hours a week\ndoes it take? Fifteen. You know. And yet they"},"889":{"dur":2,"text":"don't\nhave time to do the very basic things we need"},"891":{"dur":2,"text":"them to\ndo -- you need them to do. So I just say to"},"894":{"dur":3,"text":"you, track\nit for a week, break it into one, twos, and"},"897":{"dur":2,"text":"threes,\nmatch it with your priorities, and see what"},"900":{"dur":4,"text":"the match or\nmismatch is. To me, if you do nothing beyond"},"904":{"dur":2,"text":"sitting\nhere for lunch today, if you can write down"},"907":{"dur":2,"text":"your vision,\nyour top priorities, and you work on matching"},"909":{"dur":2,"text":"your time,\nthere's a bunch of other things that we're"},"912":{"dur":5,"text":"going to talk\nabout but that I've seen. That alone can make"},"917":{"dur":5,"text":"somebody\nwho's good a lot better immediately. As simple"},"922":{"dur":8,"text":"as it\nis. All right. Okay. Now once -- by the way,"},"931":{"dur":1,"text":"my\ndefinition of leadership, just for what it's"},"933":{"dur":3,"text":"worth given\nI asked if you wanted -- who all -- I talk"},"936":{"dur":3,"text":"about\nleadership, I teach leadership.
