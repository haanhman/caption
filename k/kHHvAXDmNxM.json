Now,"},"1075":{"dur":6,"text":"as Brandon mentioned, I look for early instances\nof some of these things in action, and so"},"1082":{"dur":5,"text":"I want to share a couple of examples of the\nopportunity that s playing out in some domains"},"1088":{"dur":6,"text":"that are not very central to business, but\nI think the opportunity is to learn from those"},"1094":{"dur":8,"text":"environments and apply design principles into\nbusiness. So one example of where some of"},"1102":{"dur":6,"text":"this scalable pull platform is emerging is\nonline in a video game that most of you, many"},"1109":{"dur":6,"text":"of you at least, may be familiar with called\nWorld of Warcraft.

There\ns another example that we ve spent a fair"},"1156":{"dur":6,"text":"amount of time with and we talk about in the\nbook, which is extreme sports.

So they re deeply grounded in"},"1186":{"dur":5,"text":"their physical environment, but the scalability\nof the learning comes from the opportunity"},"1191":{"dur":6,"text":"to layer on top of that physical experience\nparticipation in virtual environments, and"},"1198":{"dur":4,"text":"again, learning from each other regardless\nof where these surfers are located.
