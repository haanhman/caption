world,"},"21":{"dur":2,"text":"but if you live in a country\nlike the United States,"},"24":{"dur":3,"text":"there's certain appurtenances available\nto you that do make life easier."},"27":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you're in a building,\nyou can take an elevator."},"29":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're crossing the street,\nyou have sidewalk cutouts."},"32":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you have to travel\nsome distance farther"},"34":{"dur":3,"text":"than you can do under your own power,\nthere's accessible vehicles,"},"37":{"dur":1,"text":"and if you can't afford one of those,"},"39":{"dur":2,"text":"there's accessible public transportation."},"41":{"dur":2,"text":"But in the developing world,\nthings are quite different."},"44":{"dur":3,"text":"There's 40 million people who need\na wheelchair but don't have one,"},"47":{"dur":3,"text":"and the majority of these\npeople live in rural areas,"},"51":{"dur":3,"text":"where the only connections to community,\nto employment, to education,"},"55":{"dur":2,"text":"are by traveling long\ndistances on rough terrain"},"57":{"dur":2,"text":"often under their own power."},"60":{"dur":2,"text":"And the devices usually\navailable to these people"},"62":{"dur":2,"text":"are not made for that context,\nbreak down quickly,"},"65":{"dur":2,"text":"and are hard to repair."},"67":{"dur":4,"text":"I started looking at wheelchairs\nin developing countries in 2005,"},"72":{"dur":3,"text":"when I spent the summer assessing\nthe state of technology in Tanzania,"},"75":{"dur":3,"text":"and I talked to wheelchair users, wheelchair\nmanufacturers, disability groups,"},"79":{"dur":1,"text":"and what stood out to me"},"81":{"dur":2,"text":"is that there wasn't a device available"},"84":{"dur":2,"text":"that was designed for rural\nareas, that could go fast"},"86":{"dur":2,"text":"and efficiently on many types of terrain."},"89":{"dur":1,"text":"So being a mechanical engineer,"},"91":{"dur":2,"text":"being at MIT and having lots\nof resources available to me,"},"93":{"dur":2,"text":"I thought I'd try to do\nsomething about it."},"96":{"dur":2,"text":"Now when you're talking\nabout trying to travel"},"99":{"dur":2,"text":"long distances on rough terrain,"},"101":{"dur":1,"text":"I immediately thought of a mountain bike,"},"103":{"dur":1,"text":"and a mountain bike's good at doing this"},"104":{"dur":1,"text":"because it has a gear train,"},"106":{"dur":2,"text":"and you can shift to a low gear\nif you have to climb a hill"},"109":{"dur":1,"text":"or go through mud or sand"},"110":{"dur":2,"text":"and you get a lot of torque\nbut a low speed."},"112":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you want to go\nfaster, say on pavement,"},"114":{"dur":1,"text":"you can shift to a high gear,"},"116":{"dur":2,"text":"and you get less torque,\nbut higher speeds."},"118":{"dur":1,"text":"So the logical evolution here"},"120":{"dur":2,"text":"is to just make a wheelchair\nwith mountain bike components,"},"122":{"dur":1,"text":"which many people have done."},"124":{"dur":3,"text":"But these are two products\navailable in the U.S. that"},"127":{"dur":2,"text":"would be difficult to transfer\ninto developing countries"},"130":{"dur":2,"text":"because they're much, much too expensive."},"132":{"dur":2,"text":"And the context I'm talking about is where"},"134":{"dur":3,"text":"you need to have a product\nthat is less than 200 dollars."},"138":{"dur":2,"text":"And this ideal product\nwould also be able to go"},"141":{"dur":3,"text":"about five kilometers a day so you\ncould get to your job, get to school,"},"145":{"dur":1,"text":"and do it on many,\nmany different types of terrain."},"147":{"dur":2,"text":"But when you get home or want\nto go indoors at your work,"},"150":{"dur":4,"text":"it's got to be small enough and maneuverable\nenough to use inside."},"154":{"dur":3,"text":"And furthermore, if you want it to last\na long time out in rural areas,"},"157":{"dur":4,"text":"it has to be repairable using the local\ntools, materials and knowledge"},"161":{"dur":2,"text":"in those contexts."},"164":{"dur":2,"text":"So the real crux of the problem here is,"},"167":{"dur":3,"text":"how do you make a system\nthat's a simple device"},"170":{"dur":2,"text":"but gives you a large\nmechanical advantage?"},"173":{"dur":2,"text":"How do you make a mountain\nbike for your arms"},"175":{"dur":2,"text":"that doesn't have the mountain\nbike cost and complexity?"},"177":{"dur":2,"text":"So as is the case with simple solutions,"},"180":{"dur":3,"text":"oftentimes the answer is right in front\nof your face, and for us it was levers."},"184":{"dur":4,"text":"We use levers all the time,\nin tools, doorknobs, bicycle parts."},"188":{"dur":2,"text":"And that moment of inspiration,\nthat key invention moment,"},"191":{"dur":2,"text":"was when I was sitting\nin front of my design notebook"},"194":{"dur":2,"text":"and I started thinking\nabout somebody grabbing a lever,"},"196":{"dur":2,"text":"and if they grab\nnear the end of the lever,"},"198":{"dur":1,"text":"they can get an effectively long lever"},"200":{"dur":2,"text":"and produce a lot of torque\nas they push back and forth,"},"203":{"dur":2,"text":"and effectively get a low gear."},"205":{"dur":2,"text":"And as they slide\ntheir hand down the lever,"},"208":{"dur":2,"text":"they can push with a smaller\neffective lever length,"},"211":{"dur":2,"text":"but push through a bigger\nangle every stroke,"},"213":{"dur":3,"text":"which makes a faster rotational speed,\nand gives you an effective high gear."},"216":{"dur":1,"text":"So what's exciting about this system"},"218":{"dur":2,"text":"is that it's really, really\nmechanically simple,"},"221":{"dur":1,"text":"and you could make it using technology"},"223":{"dur":1,"text":"that's been around for hundreds of years."},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"So seeing this in practice,"},"227":{"dur":1,"text":"this is the Leveraged Freedom Chair that,"},"229":{"dur":1,"text":"after a few years of development,"},"230":{"dur":1,"text":"we're now going into production with,"},"232":{"dur":2,"text":"and this is a full-time wheelchair user --"},"234":{"dur":1,"text":"he's paralyzed -- in Guatemala,"},"236":{"dur":3,"text":"and you see he's able to traverse\npretty rough terrain."},"240":{"dur":4,"text":"Again, the key innovation of this technology\nis that when he wants to go fast,"},"244":{"dur":4,"text":"he just grabs the levers near the pivots\nand goes through a big angle every stroke,"},"248":{"dur":2,"text":"and as the going gets tougher, he just\nslides his hands up the levers,"},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"creates more torque, and kind\nof bench-presses his way"},"254":{"dur":2,"text":"out of trouble through the rough terrain."},"256":{"dur":2,"text":"Now the big, important point here is that"},"259":{"dur":2,"text":"the person is the complex\nmachine in this system."},"262":{"dur":3,"text":"It's the person that's sliding\nhis hands up and down the levers,"},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"so the mechanism itself can be very simple"},"268":{"dur":3,"text":"and composed of bicycle parts you\ncan get anywhere in the world."},"271":{"dur":1,"text":"Because those bicycle parts"},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"are so ubiquitously available,\nthey're super-cheap."},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"They're made by the gazillions\nin China and India,"},"277":{"dur":1,"text":"and we can source them\nanywhere in the world,"},"279":{"dur":2,"text":"build the chair anywhere,\nand most importantly repair it,"},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"even out in a village\nwith a local bicycle mechanic"},"284":{"dur":4,"text":"who has local tools, knowledge\nand parts available."},"289":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, when you want to use the LFC indoors,"},"291":{"dur":3,"text":"all you have to do is pull\nthe levers out of the drivetrain,"},"295":{"dur":3,"text":"stow them in the frame, and it\nconverts into a normal wheelchair"},"298":{"dur":2,"text":"that you can use just\nlike any other normal wheelchair,"},"301":{"dur":1,"text":"and we sized it like a normal wheelchair,"},"303":{"dur":4,"text":"so it's narrow enough to fit\nthrough a standard doorway,"},"307":{"dur":3,"text":"it's low enough to fit under a table,"},"311":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's small and maneuverable\nenough to fit in a bathroom"},"315":{"dur":3,"text":"and this is important so the user\ncan get up close to a toilet,"},"318":{"dur":1,"text":"and be able to transfer off"},"319":{"dur":5,"text":"just like he could in a normal wheelchair."},"325":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, there's three important\npoints that I want to stress"},"328":{"dur":3,"text":"that I think really hit\nhome in this project."},"332":{"dur":3,"text":"The first is that this\nproduct works well because"},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"we were effectively able to combine"},"337":{"dur":4,"text":"rigorous engineering science\nand analysis with user-centered design"},"341":{"dur":3,"text":"focused on the social and usage\nand economic factors"},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"important to wheelchair users\nin the developing countries."},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm an academic at MIT,\nand I'm a mechanical engineer,"},"350":{"dur":3,"text":"so I can do things like look at the type\nof terrain you want to travel on,"},"353":{"dur":2,"text":"and figure out how much\nresistance it should impose,"},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"look at the parts we have\navailable and mix and match them"},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"to figure out what sort\nof gear trains we can use,"},"362":{"dur":3,"text":"and then look at the power and force\nyou can get out of your upper body"},"365":{"dur":1,"text":"to analyze how fast you should\nbe able to go in this chair"},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"as you put your arms\nup and down the levers."},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"So as a wet-behind-the-ears\nstudent, excited,"},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"our team made a prototype,"},"375":{"dur":4,"text":"brought that prototype to Tanzania,\nKenya and Vietnam in 2008,"},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"and found it was terrible"},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"because we didn't get\nenough input from users."},"384":{"dur":3,"text":"So because we tested it\nwith wheelchair users,"},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"with wheelchair manufacturers,\nwe got that feedback from them,"},"390":{"dur":3,"text":"not just articulating their problems,\nbut articulating their solutions,"},"393":{"dur":3,"text":"and worked together to go back\nto the drawing board and make a new design,"},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"which we brought back\nto East Africa in '09"},"399":{"dur":2,"text":"that worked a lot better than a normal\nwheelchair on rough terrain,"},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"but it still didn't work well\nindoors because it was too big,"},"405":{"dur":1,"text":"it was heavy, it was hard to move around,"},"407":{"dur":3,"text":"so again with that user feedback,\nwe went back to the drawing board,"},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"came up with a better\ndesign, 20 pounds lighter,"},"413":{"dur":3,"text":"as narrow as a regular wheelchair, tested\nthat in a field trial in Guatemala,"},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"and that advanced the product to the point"},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"where we have now that it's going\ninto production."},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"Now also being engineering scientists,"},"424":{"dur":3,"text":"we were able to quantify the performance\nbenefits of the Leveraged Freedom Chair,"},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"so here are some shots\nof our trial in Guatemala"},"430":{"dur":3,"text":"where we tested the LFC\non village terrain,"},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"and tested people's biomechanical outputs,"},"436":{"dur":2,"text":"their oxygen consumption,\nhow fast they go,"},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"how much power they're putting out,"},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"both in their regular\nwheelchairs and using the LFC,"},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"and we found that the LFC\nis about 80 percent faster"},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"going on these terrains\nthan a normal wheelchair."},"448":{"dur":3,"text":"It's also about 40 percent more\nefficient than a regular wheelchair,"},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"and because of the mechanical\nadvantage you get from the levers,"},"454":{"dur":1,"text":"you can produce 50 percent higher torque"},"455":{"dur":3,"text":"and really muscle your way\nthrough the really, really rough terrain."},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"Now the second lesson\nthat we learned in this is that"},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"the constraints on this design\nreally push the innovation,"},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"because we had to hit\nsuch a low price point,"},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"because we had to make\na device that could travel"},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"on many, many types of terrain\nbut still be usable indoors,"},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"and be simple enough to repair,"},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"we ended up with a fundamentally\nnew product,"},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"a new product that is an innovation"},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"in a space that really hasn't\nchanged in a hundred years."},"483":{"dur":3,"text":"And these are all merits that are not\njust good in the developing world."},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"Why not in countries like the U.S. too?"},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"So we teamed up with Continuum,"},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"a local product design firm here in Boston"},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"to make the high-end version,\nthe developed world version,"},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"that we'll probably sell primarily\nin the U.S. and Europe,"},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"but to higher-income buyers."},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"And the final point I want\nto make is that I think"},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"this project worked\nwell because we engaged"},"507":{"dur":4,"text":"all the stakeholders that buy into this\nproject and are important to consider"},"512":{"dur":3,"text":"in bringing the technology\nfrom inception of an idea"},"515":{"dur":4,"text":"through innovation, validation,\ncommercialization and dissemination,"},"519":{"dur":3,"text":"and that cycle has to start\nand end with end users."},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"These are the people that define\nthe requirements of the technology,"},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"and these are the people that have\nto give the thumbs-up at the end,"},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"and say, \"Yeah, it actually works.\nIt meets our needs.\""},"531":{"dur":1,"text":"So people like me in the academic space,"},"533":{"dur":3,"text":"we can do things like innovate\nand analyze and test,"},"536":{"dur":3,"text":"create data and make\nbench-level prototypes,"},"539":{"dur":3,"text":"but how do you get that bench-level\nprototype to commercialization?"},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"So we need gap-fillers like Continuum\nthat can work on commercializing,"},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"and we started a whole NGO\nto bring our chair to market --"},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"Global Research Innovation Technology --"},"551":{"dur":3,"text":"and then we also teamed up with a big\nmanufacturer in India, Pinnacle Industries,"},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"that's tooled up now\nto make 500 chairs a month"},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"and will make the first\nbatch of 200 next month,"},"558":{"dur":1,"text":"which will be delivered in India."},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"And then finally, to get this\nout to the people in scale,"},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"we teamed up with the largest\ndisability organization"},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"in the world, Jaipur Foot."},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"Now what's powerful about this model"},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"is when you bring together\nall these stakeholders"},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"that represent each link in the chain"},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"from inception of an idea"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"all the way to implementation\nin the field,"},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"that's where the magic happens."},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"That's where you can take\na guy like me, an academic,"},"584":{"dur":3,"text":"but analyze and test\nand create a new technology"},"587":{"dur":3,"text":"and quantitatively determine\nhow much better the performance is."},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"You can connect with stakeholders\nlike the manufacturers"},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"and talk with them face-to-face\nand leverage their"},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"local knowledge of manufacturing\npractices and their clients"},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"and combine that knowledge\nwith our engineering knowledge"},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"to create something greater\nthan either of us could have done alone."},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"And then you can also engage the end user"},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"in the design process, and not\njust ask him what he needs,"},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"but ask him how he thinks\nit can be achieved."},"613":{"dur":3,"text":"And this picture was taken\nin India in our last field trial,"},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"where we had a 90-percent\nadoption rate where people"},"619":{"dur":3,"text":"switched to using our Leveraged Freedom\nChair over their normal wheelchair,"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"and this picture specifically is of Ashok,"},"625":{"dur":3,"text":"and Ashok had a spinal injury\nwhen he fell out of a tree,"},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"and he had been working at a tailor,\nbut once he was injured"},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"he wasn't able to transport\nhimself from his house"},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"over a kilometer to his shop\nin his normal wheelchair."},"637":{"dur":1,"text":"The road was too rough."},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"But the day after he got\nan LFC, he hopped in it,"},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"rode that kilometer, opened up his shop"},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"and soon after landed a contract\nto make school uniforms"},"646":{"dur":3,"text":"and started making money, started\nproviding for his family again."},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"Ashok: You also encouraged me to work."},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"I rested for a day at home."},"653":{"dur":4,"text":"The next day I went to my shop."},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"Now everything is back to normal."},"661":{"dur":4,"text":"Amos Winter: And thank you\nvery much for having me today."},"665":{"dur":4,"text":"(Applause)"}}
