playing"},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"roles like Astrid, and\nAraminta, and Peik Lin."},"399":{"dur":1,"text":"That was easy."},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"There were so many amazing\nactresses from all across

there"},"438":{"dur":3,"text":"who can really fulfill that\nromantic leading man role."},"441":{"dur":4,"text":"You know, who can be the\nnext Asian Ryan Gosling."},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"And finding one who could\ndo a flawless British accent"},"448":{"dur":1,"text":"was even tougher."},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"So it surprised all\nof us that there"},"451":{"dur":1,"text":"was such a small\npool of people that"},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"were available and could do it."},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"But it really shouldn't\nhave surprised us."},"457":{"dur":3,"text":"John Chu and I really quickly\nrealized that it's really"},"461":{"dur":1,"text":"a matter of culture."},"463":{"dur":1,"text":"The both of us\ngrew up in families"},"465":{"dur":3,"text":"that immigrated from Asia,\nso we knew the issues well."},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"The simple fact is\nthat Asian men--"},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"not just in the US,\nbut around the world--"},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"are raised from a\nreally early age"},"474":{"dur":4,"text":"to focus on excelling in\nthe professional realm."},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"So to go to the best\nschools and work at the most"},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"prestigious companies."},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you're a good looking,\nsmart, ambitious young Asian"},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"guy between 25 and\n35, you're most"},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"likely going to be\na doctor, a lawyer,"},"492":{"dur":4,"text":"or working at Goldman Sachs,\nor working here at Google,"},"496":{"dur":0,"text":"don't you think?"},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, I can see\nprobably some of you"},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"out here that could\nhave auditioned."},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"And why didn't you, right?"},"504":{"dur":3,"text":"So that was very\ninteresting to discover."},"508":{"dur":6,"text":"And there is little to no\nsupport for Asian boys growing"},"514":{"dur":5,"text":"up to ever become actors,\nwritists, dancers, you know--"},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"And in fact, I think\ntelling your Asian parents"},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"you want to go into\nacting is probably"},"524":{"dur":4,"text":"worse than telling them that\nyou got your teacher pregnant--"},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"your gym teacher, you know."},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"So this goes back to\nmy mom and her quest"},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"for me to work at\nsomeplace like Google."},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"Yes, there's a part of her\nthat's so proud of me that"},"539":{"dur":1,"text":"I've written a book that's--"},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"she sees on book\nshelves at Barnes Noble."},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"Or like gets angry at them when\nthey don't have it in

school."},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"That's just the\nplain fact of it."},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"So for me, leading a creative\nlife for the past two decades--"},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"going to journalism school,\ngoing to art school,"},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"making experimental films\nfor weird dance companies"},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"in New York."},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"All that has been a\ncomplete act of rebellion."},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"Quiet rebellion, but a\nrebellion nonetheless."},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"And when we found our leading\nman for \"Crazy Rich Asians,\""},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"Henry Golding, who is half\nMalaysian and half British"},"578":{"dur":3,"text":"and who has grown up in Malaysia\nand now lives in Singapore,"},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"I realized we had\nso much in common"},"584":{"dur":3,"text":"because he was also a\nrebel in his own way."},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"He never went to university."},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"He dropped out of\nschool at age 15"},"592":{"dur":4,"text":"and went and apprenticed\nat a hair salon."},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"That was the fun, cool,\ncreative thing to do."},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"And he actually became a\nleading hairdresser in London,"},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"and just last week cut my\nhair on the beach in Malaysia."},"603":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's really surreal to get\nyour hair cut by the leading"},"607":{"dur":3,"text":"man that you've\ncreated in a book,"},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"and now he's cutting your hair."},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"But it was a great haircut."},"613":{"dur":4,"text":"Anyway, at age 23,\nhe left London and he"},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"was so unbelievably\nhandsome, everyone"},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"kept saying you should be an\nactor, you should an actor."},"622":{"dur":1,"text":"So he moved to Asia\nto pursue that."},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"And the rest is history."},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"And then as I began\nmeeting all the other cast"},"630":{"dur":1,"text":"members, all of the actors--"},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"Ronnie Chang, who is so\namazing in the Daily Show,"},"634":{"dur":4,"text":"Remi Hii who is from Marco Polo,\nChris Pang, just to name a few."},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"I realize we all\nshared similar stories"},"641":{"dur":4,"text":"of this sort of quiet rebellion\nin one way or another."},"646":{"dur":1,"text":"So I just got back,\nas I said, from being"},"647":{"dur":1,"text":"on the set of \"Crazy\nRich Asians\" in Malaysia"},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"and at first I wasn't\nplanning to go."},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, there was so much\nhappening with my book being"},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"launched, everything like that."},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"And I didn't want my presence\nto really distract the cast"},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"and distract John."},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"But one by one, the actors\nstarted contacting me."},"664":{"dur":1,"text":"And I would get\ntexts from Henry,"},"665":{"dur":1,"text":"like why aren't you here?"},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"Like, you have to be here\nto see the production."},"669":{"dur":4,"text":"And Chris Pang, who is the star\nof Netflix series Marco Polo,"},"674":{"dur":5,"text":"he said, get your ass on a plane\nright now and come to Malaysia."},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"Something very special is\nhappening here right now."},"683":{"dur":1,"text":"So I did."},"684":{"dur":3,"text":"I went to KL two weeks\nago, and arriving"},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"on the set of the film--"},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"which was this historic\nmansion they found on top of KL"},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"that they are using to\nbe Tyersall Park, which"},"695":{"dur":1,"text":"is the mansion for my books--"},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"it was one of the most surreal\nexperiences of my life."},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, to sort\nof see the sets,"},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"see these settings\nI only wrote about,"},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"and to meet these characters\nthat were only in my mind,"},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"be real and living people."},"709":{"dur":4,"text":"It was really amazing\nand kind of surreal."},"713":{"dur":3,"text":"But the most wonderful thing I\ndon't think I'll ever forgot,"},"717":{"dur":3,"text":"was just kind of the\nexcitement and the look"},"720":{"dur":4,"text":"of exhilaration in the\neyes of all these actors."},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"And I realized-- I mean, I\nrealized that for most of these"},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"actors that's assembled here,\nthe ones especially that"},"730":{"dur":4,"text":"didn't grow up in Asia, this was\na life changing

around the world--"},"740":{"dur":1,"text":"they were getting\nto play roles that"},"741":{"dur":3,"text":"weren't based on stereotypes."},"745":{"dur":3,"text":"They weren't playing supporting\nroles

through the\nfirewall in three seconds."},"758":{"dur":1,"text":"Even if they had\nthe smallest parts,"},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"they all felt like they were\nbeing treated like leading

for the first time\never, they all felt like stars."},"772":{"dur":2,"text":"Interestingly enough, I\nalso met some of the actors"},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"in the film that\ncame from Asia--"},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"you know, the ones from\nSingapore, Malaysia, Hong"},"779":{"dur":1,"text":"Kong, China."},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"And for them, they were\nexcited to be in the film,"},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"but it wasn't that\nbig a deal for them."},"785":{"dur":1,"text":"This was another movie."},"787":{"dur":3,"text":"A great movie and part\nof, but another

only"},"818":{"dur":3,"text":"Asian guy in the whole\ncast of white people."},"822":{"dur":1,"text":"And he could finally\nplay a role where he"},"824":{"dur":3,"text":"was an attractive, desired

actors."},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"Because for them,\nit was a revelation."},"837":{"dur":2,"text":"These people-- actors like\nPierre Png of Singapore--"},"840":{"dur":1,"text":"he's the Brad Pitt\nof
