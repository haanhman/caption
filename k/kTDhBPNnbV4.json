deal."},"1666":{"dur":3,"text":"And so it hardly generates\nany money for the trust."},"1669":{"dur":2,"text":"So what happened was\nthat the trust has not"},"1672":{"dur":3,"text":"been able to maintain\nall its holdings."},"1675":{"dur":6,"text":"It's responsible for most\nof the Hudson waterfront"},"1681":{"dur":2,"text":"south of about 59th Street."},"1684":{"dur":2,"text":"And it had to

they thought,\nwhat better place"},"2662":{"dur":4,"text":"to put another stadium\nthan in the park?"},"2666":{"dur":2,"text":"So they petitioned the\ncity parks

well,"},"2714":{"dur":1,"text":"that's a reasonable request."},"2715":{"dur":1,"text":"What do you want to do with it?"},"2717":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe we'll give it to you."},"2720":{"dur":4,"text":"And so there's a lot of pressure\non cities to give up this land."},"2727":{"dur":3,"text":"Another big pressure\nthat I think"},"2731":{"dur":6,"text":"has a lot of

a\nlittle too easy to say,"},"2839":{"dur":5,"text":"OK, you worked this\nland for a little while,"},"2844":{"dur":1,"text":"but now we're going\nto do something"},"2846":{"dur":3,"text":"more

development,"},"2890":{"dur":1,"text":"and the pressure is enormous."},"2896":{"dur":3,"text":"So I thought I would\nadd in my talking what"},"2900":{"dur":6,"text":"can be done to make sure

good parks?"},"2916":{"dur":2,"text":"One of the good things\nhappening in Philadelphia--"},"2918":{"dur":1,"text":"and I think in a\nfew other cities--"},"2920":{"dur":4,"text":"is that there have\nbeen the creation"},"2924":{"dur":2,"text":"of these citywide conservancies."},"2926":{"dur":2,"text":"And in Philadelphia it's called\nthe Fairmount Park

vacant lot."},"2978":{"dur":1,"text":"They were able to\nget title to it."},"2980":{"dur":3,"text":"They convinced the city to\nlet them build this park."},"2984":{"dur":1,"text":"They raised all the money."},"2989":{"dur":2,"text":"They enlisted the help of\nthe city water department."},"2991":{"dur":3,"text":"And because the water department\nis concerned about

schoolyards."},"3135":{"dur":4,"text":"And now I think that\nposition has shifted."},"3140":{"dur":2,"text":"And Philadelphia\nstarted a program"},"3143":{"dur":2,"text":"to green some of\nthe school yards,"},"3145":{"dur":3,"text":"and using water department\nmoney, and other money."},"3149":{"dur":4,"text":"And if that's the only open\nspace in a neighborhood,"},"3154":{"dur":3,"text":"that's

fully buy it."},"3325":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean, that's the argument\nfor Central Park, and the High"},"3329":{"dur":3,"text":"Line, is that the city doesn't\nhave to spend as much money."},"3333":{"dur":3,"text":"But I think we still see cities\nnot committing as much money"},"3337":{"dur":1,"text":"as they should to other parks."},"3339":{"dur":4,"text":"And I totally agree

everything."},"3351":{"dur":1,"text":"They can't do\ncapital improvements."},"3359":{"dur":2,"text":"So, we did have a\nchange in the mayor."},"3362":{"dur":2,"text":"And he put $130\nmillion of city

thing."},"3370":{"dur":0,"text":"Yeah."},"3371":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah."},"3373":{"dur":4,"text":"So you talked about the need\nfor cities to fund parks."},"3378":{"dur":2,"text":"In most of the

any\nthoughts about how that plays"},"3403":{"dur":3,"text":"into the current\nsituation in this country,"},"3407":{"dur":5,"text":"with people becoming afraid of\nhow the police are taking over?"},"3412":{"dur":5,"text":"Yet we have, as a society,\ndemanded police protection."},"3418":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's, I think, what's\nled to the set of

parks,"},"3838":{"dur":2,"text":"and different types of\ngroups paying for parks."},"3841":{"dur":1,"text":"Because one of the\nweird things about"},"3842":{"dur":2,"text":"our country is that we

New York and Philadelphia\nmight be kind of an exception."},"3865":{"dur":3,"text":"The secret ingredient that seems\nto be missing from so many city"},"3869":{"dur":2,"text":"parks is

think\npublic engagement can"},"3971":{"dur":0,"text":"help that process."},"3976":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, it's a big subject."},"3978":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a very big subject."},"3979":{"dur":4,"text":"And there's a different\nstory for every park."},"3983":{"dur":1,"text":"I'd be curious to\nknow the reasons why"},"3985":{"dur":2,"text":"that park that

park,"},"4047":{"dur":4,"text":"how could you not engage\nthe people who live there?"},"4052":{"dur":1,"text":"The only thing I\nwould say about it"},"4054":{"dur":1,"text":"is what

a\nlot of other cities"},"4081":{"dur":0,"text":"don't come anywhere close."},"4084":{"dur":1,"text":"Because the budget\nis more towards"},"4086":{"dur":3,"text":"the actual physical
