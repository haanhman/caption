this actually\nmeans is the search"},"236":{"dur":3,"text":"space for new algorithms is\ngetting much, much smaller."},"239":{"dur":2,"text":"So it means that we can\nalmost brute force the

itself."},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"So let's take the\nclassic chess computer"},"265":{"dur":3,"text":"system developed by IBM back\nin the day called Deep Blue."},"268":{"dur":3,"text":"And it beat

different"},"338":{"dur":3,"text":"algorithmic systems today."},"341":{"dur":1,"text":"And what we're\nultimately interested in"},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"is how we build general\npurpose learning systems."},"345":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'm going to tell\nyou a little bit"},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"about the kind of\nphilosophy or the framework"},"348":{"dur":1,"text":"that we use to\ntrain these systems."},"350":{"dur":2,"text":"Traditional AI approaches\nhave focused, as I said,"},"353":{"dur":1,"text":"on very structured,\nrule-based learning, that"},"355":{"dur":4,"text":"take the human intelligence as\nexpressed in symbols or words"},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"and try to represent that\nin kind of Boolean logic."},"363":{"dur":1,"text":"So if this, then that."},"364":{"dur":1,"text":"And what we've been\nvery committed to do"},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"is to try to train\nan algorithm to learn"},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"its own representation\nof the world"},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"through interaction\nwith some environment."},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"So all of our systems begin\nwith the training of a machine"},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"learning system, or an agent."},"379":{"dur":4,"text":"That agent has some goal, which\nis defined by the human being,"},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's able to interact\nwith some environment."},"385":{"dur":1,"text":"And you can think\nof this environment"},"386":{"dur":1,"text":"in very general terms."},"387":{"dur":3,"text":"It could be a robotic system\ninteracting with a kitchen"},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"or a car manufacturing plant."},"393":{"dur":1,"text":"It could be YouTube,\nwhere the environment is"},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"to try to recommend\nvideos that people watch,"},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"or it could be an energy grid."},"400":{"dur":3,"text":"And that agent is able\nto take a set of actions"},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"in the environment,\ninteract with it in some way"},"405":{"dur":1,"text":"by recommending a\nvideo on YouTube"},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"or controlling a robotic arm."},"409":{"dur":4,"text":"And then the environment passes\nback a set of state updates."},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"So after the interaction\nwith the environment,"},"416":{"dur":1,"text":"the environment has\nsomehow changed."},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"And so all the sensors\nthat collect information"},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"about that environment send\nthe updated observations"},"423":{"dur":1,"text":"back to the agent."},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's through this\nprocess of interaction"},"427":{"dur":1,"text":"through reinforcement\nlearning, we're"},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"able to train agents to learn\ntheir own representation"},"431":{"dur":4,"text":"of what it takes to\noptimize some goal."},"435":{"dur":1,"text":"And right in the\nbeginning, we were"},"437":{"dur":1,"text":"very successful in\ntraining our algorithms"},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"on the old-school Atari testbed."},"441":{"dur":1,"text":"So many of you will\nbe familiar with this."},"442":{"dur":3,"text":"It's like 100 or so Atari\ngames from the '70s and '80s."},"446":{"dur":3,"text":"And the environment is\nsimply a set of raw pixels."},"450":{"dur":4,"text":"So at every frame, we're\npassing back a set of RGB,"},"454":{"dur":3,"text":"or red, green, blue\nvalues, to the algorithm"},"457":{"dur":6,"text":"based on where that sits in\na frame, on an x and y-axis."},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"And so really there's no\npre-programmed knowledge."},"466":{"dur":1,"text":"Everything is\nlearned from scratch."},"468":{"dur":3,"text":"So we're not hand coding any\ninsight into the algorithm."},"471":{"dur":1,"text":"We're not saying, this\nis what a color is"},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"or this is what motion\nand dynamics are,"},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"or this is a paddle,\nthis is an enemy."},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"We're really saying\ngiven this set of pixels,"},"480":{"dur":3,"text":"over time can you optimize\nyour goal function,"},"484":{"dur":4,"text":"which is to get more reward,\nby tweaking the action buttons?"},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that is really\nall we give to the agent."},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"We just wire them up\nto the action buttons"},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"and give them the motivation of\ntrying to optimize for score."},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"So really the best intuition is\nto think about a robot standing"},"499":{"dur":3,"text":"in an arcade being fed the\npixels from the video screen"},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"and fiddling around with the\njoystick and the fire button"},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"in order to find out\nwhat the association is"},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"between the set of actions it's\nable to take, the set of pixels"},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"that it saw in the\nlast few frames,"},"515":{"dur":1,"text":"and the reward that it gets."},"516":{"dur":1,"text":"It's kind of just simple\nassociative learning"},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"at one level."},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"So let me give you a sense\nfor what this looks like."},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the old\ngame of Breakout."},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"And here we are after\n100 games, the agent's"},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"just arrived in the environment."},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"So it really has\nno idea what to do."},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"It's sort of moving\naround left and right,"},"532":{"dur":3,"text":"trying to explore the\nspace and randomly discover"},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"what kind of actions\nseem to be rewarding."},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"After 300 games,\nit seems to have"},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"learned pretty well that\nthere's a strong association"},"544":{"dur":1,"text":"between moving the bat\ninto the right place"},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"to hit the ball back\nat the right time."},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is pretty\nmuch human performance."},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"This is better than I can play."},"552":{"dur":3,"text":"But interestingly, we left\nit training for 500 games"},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"overnight, and it developed\nthis really cool strategy"},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"where it tunnels the\nball up the sides"},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"to get maximum points\nwith minimum effort."},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"And this was super\nsurprising to us"},"565":{"dur":3,"text":"as engineers because it was\nreally cool in some sense"},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"because many humans don't\nrealize that strategy when"},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"playing the game,\nand it was something"},"573":{"dur":3,"text":"that emerged through\nthe agent interacting"},"576":{"dur":1,"text":"with the game on its own."},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's really surprising\nto see the first signs,"},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"the complex behaviors,\nrelatively complex behaviors,"},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"can emerge without us\nhand-crafting those features"},"586":{"dur":0,"text":"in."},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"So this was really\nexciting to us two"},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"and a half, three years ago."},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"Another example is the\ngame of Space Invaders."},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"And so this is a video\nof before training."},"597":{"dur":3,"text":"You can see that it's getting\nkilled all of the time."},"600":{"dur":1,"text":"It's sort of randomly\nfiring around."},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"It doesn't realize that\nthose things are denying it,"},"604":{"dur":1,"text":"when it gets hit by\none of those missiles,"},"606":{"dur":1,"text":"it's denying it\nfrom getting score."},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"It doesn't realize that when it\nhits one of the Space Invaders"},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"above, it's actually\ngetting reward."},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"And after training, it's\nlearned a whole bunch"},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"of really interesting dynamics."},"617":{"dur":1,"text":"So first of all,\nyou can see it often"},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"hiding behind the orange\nobstacle, because it knows"},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"that if it gets hit by\none of those missiles"},"623":{"dur":1,"text":"it's in big trouble."},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"Secondly, you can see\nthat it's actually"},"626":{"dur":1,"text":"often aiming at the top."},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's trying to\nget those ones first"},"629":{"dur":1,"text":"because it gets more reward."},"630":{"dur":1,"text":"Here, we see the\npink mothership."},"632":{"dur":1,"text":"And it does an incredible\npredictive shot"},"633":{"dur":3,"text":"to try and get that because it\ngets more reward for hitting"},"637":{"dur":1,"text":"that at the right time."},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"And the other thing is you can\nsee that it very rarely wastes"},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"It's actually very\nprecise and accurate"},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"and it can do really\ncool predictive shots,"},"646":{"dur":3,"text":"just right at the end, as you\nsee, to get the last enemy."},"649":{"dur":3,"text":"So it plays the game and\nindeed it plays 57 of the games"},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"to human or superhuman\nperformance."},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"The same algorithm performing\nin a very general way"},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"across all of these\ndifferent environments."},"661":{"dur":1,"text":"And the environments\nperceptually"},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"have very different physics,\nvery different objectives,"},"666":{"dur":3,"text":"very, in some cases, long-term\ntemporal dependencies."},"669":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's not really\njust reacting;"},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"it's actually having to\nmake a series of decisions"},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"and get them right in\nsequence over time."},"675":{"dur":3,"text":"We were very lucky enough to be\nawarded a Nature paper for this"},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"and we managed to get\nthe front cover back"},"681":{"dur":3,"text":"in 2015, which, as many of you\nwill know through academics,"},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"is the prized possession\nfor an academic research"},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"lab like ours."},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"We extended this work\nearlier in the year"},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"to the old classic\nancient game of Go."},"695":{"dur":3,"text":"So let me tell you a\nlittle bit about the game."},"698":{"dur":3,"text":"Essentially, the objective\nis to place stones on a 19"},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"by 19 board."},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you're white, I'm black."},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"And the objective is to\ntry and place stones such"},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"that you surround your\nopponent's territory."},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's really no\nfurther rules than that."},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"It's very unstructured."},"714":{"dur":1,"text":"It's very abstract."},"716":{"dur":1,"text":"And there are no\nsort of tricks that"},"717":{"dur":3,"text":"help you to exploit\nstructure in the space."},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"So in chess, for\nexample, all the pieces"},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"are worth different\namounts, and so you"},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"can focus all your energy\non protecting your queen,"},"727":{"dur":1,"text":"for example, because\nit's really valuable."},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"Or you don't have to\nbother about thinking,"},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"can a pawn move\nfive squares ahead,"},"734":{"dur":1,"text":"because you know\nthat's an illegal move."},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"Whereas, in the game of Go,\nthere's very, very little"},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"structure and so\nthe search space"},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"is really absolutely enormous."},"743":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a 3,000-year-old game."},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"And believe it or not,\nit's incredibly popular"},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"There are 40 million\nplayers worldwide."},"751":{"dur":1,"text":"And the really\nextraordinary thing"},"753":{"dur":1,"text":"that make it so\ndifficult to play"},"755":{"dur":3,"text":"is that there are 10 to the\npower of 170 possible state"},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"spaces on a 19 by 19 board."},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"So just to give a sense\nof what this means,"},"764":{"dur":3,"text":"it's a 10 with 170\nzeros on to describe"},"767":{"dur":3,"text":"the number of possible\nboard configurations"},"771":{"dur":3,"text":"that are possible in the game."},"774":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's been estimated

universe"},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"than there are possible board\npositions in the game of Go."},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"So just impossibly\ndifficult large number"},"798":{"dur":2,"text":"to intuit and get\nyour head around."},"801":{"dur":1,"text":"This is roughly what\nthe branching factor"},"802":{"dur":4,"text":"looks like in chess, a\nmuch, much smaller and more"},"807":{"dur":1,"text":"structured space."},"809":{"dur":1,"text":"And so here there\nare something like 10"},"810":{"dur":3,"text":"to the power of 40\npossible board positions."},"814":{"dur":2,"text":"And so for every\npossible move, there"},"816":{"dur":1,"text":"arise another set of\nmoves that are possible,"},"818":{"dur":1,"text":"and then another\nset, and another set."},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"And this branches out for\nabout 100 or so, and that"},"823":{"dur":2,"text":"roughly makes up 10\nto the power of 40"},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"or so possible board positions."},"828":{"dur":2,"text":"But this is what it\nlooks like for there"},"830":{"dur":4,"text":"to be 10 to the power of 170\npossible board positions."},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"At every moment there's\nan enormous number"},"837":{"dur":2,"text":"of positions that are\npossible at the next move."},"839":{"dur":4,"text":"And so trying to model structure\nin a space that is so large"},"843":{"dur":3,"text":"is really very, very difficult.\nWriting an evaluation function"},"847":{"dur":2,"text":"to know if you're in a strong\nposition or a weak position"},"849":{"dur":1,"text":"is incredibly hard."},"850":{"dur":4,"text":"And so all of the top players\nessentially rely on intuition."},"855":{"dur":1,"text":"And that branching\nfactor that you"},"856":{"dur":3,"text":"see there goes on for\n200 possible branches"},"860":{"dur":3,"text":"until you reach the\nend of the game."},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"So we trained two\ndifferent neural networks"},"866":{"dur":3,"text":"that learn a representation of\nwhat is effective in the space."},"869":{"dur":4,"text":"The first is to basically say,\ngiven a set of possible moves"},"874":{"dur":3,"text":"that might be valuable at\nthis particular position,"},"877":{"dur":2,"text":"how do I identify which\none I should take."},"879":{"dur":2,"text":"So here what we see is\nthat, the green layer,"},"881":{"dur":2,"text":"there's 10 different positions\nthat have been identified."},"884":{"dur":2,"text":"And that network has been\ntrained on past games,"},"887":{"dur":2,"text":"100,000 or so past games."},"889":{"dur":4,"text":"So we're learning from the\nvery best of human knowledge"},"894":{"dur":2,"text":"to bootstrap our\nalgorithm to start"},"896":{"dur":2,"text":"from at least the best that\nhuman knowledge has to provide."},"899":{"dur":4,"text":"And once a particular\nposition has been identified,"},"903":{"dur":2,"text":"the
