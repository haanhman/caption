taken"},"895":{"dur":6,"text":"around the 1930s of the emperor on a\nhunting party with two of his sons."},"901":{"dur":2,"text":"And the wonderful train,\nthe [inaudible],"},"904":{"dur":5,"text":"on

the history of Ethiopia,"},"933":{"dur":5,"text":"think of a map, top-right, Horn\nof Africa, next to Sudan, Kenya,"},"938":{"dur":6,"text":"Djibouti, Somalia, that's where\nEthiopia is, in the 1930s,"},"944":{"dur":4,"text":"a very different place\nto what it is now."},"948":{"dur":6,"text":"And the emperor came to power\nin his coronation in 1930."},"954":{"dur":3,"text":"But before that, he'd\nbeen in power for 14 years"},"958":{"dur":2,"text":"as crown prince and prince regent."},"960":{"dur":2,"text":"So he was not inexperienced\nin domestic"},"963":{"dur":3,"text":"and

his power,\nand so he just invaded."},"1017":{"dur":3,"text":"The Italians, of course,\nwere also smarting very much"},"1020":{"dur":4,"text":"after they were defeated at\nthe Battle of Adwa in 1896,"},"1025":{"dur":3,"text":"the first African army\nto beat a European one."},"1029":{"dur":3,"text":"And the Italians were\nstill very sore about that."},"1033":{"dur":5,"text":"And the Empress
