when we think,"},"254":{"dur":1,"text":"oh, that's a mundane task."},"256":{"dur":2,"text":"That's actually really boring."},"258":{"dur":3,"text":"So either if it's too\ncomplicated or if it's boring,"},"261":{"dur":1,"text":"we don't really want to do it."},"263":{"dur":2,"text":"And one thing that\nI tell my students"},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"and also do myself a\nlot is start with

word here."},"414":{"dur":3,"text":"And we heard before that\nthe lists are already"},"417":{"dur":1,"text":"broken down a little bit."},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"But the lists need\nto be broken down"},"421":{"dur":3,"text":"even more, because every\nperson is different."},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"And someone might\nbe very, very easy"},"426":{"dur":3,"text":"with the task of doing some\nof the

text."},"438":{"dur":4,"text":"And then you need to try to\nfind, to assign your own times."},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"And a lot of that is experience."},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"But there's also\nsomething else to that."},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"If you plan for\nyour time, you need"},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"to add a little bit of buffer."},"452":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you think, I can read\nthat text in two hours,"},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"then you have to\nthink what else might"},"457":{"dur":1,"text":"happen in these two hours."},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"First of all, is it a good idea\nto try to do it in one block?"},"462":{"dur":0,"text":"Maybe it is."},"463":{"dur":3,"text":"Maybe that's the time\nspan you can focus."},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe your focus\nspan is only an hour,"},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"so you need to plan\nfor a break in between."},"471":{"dur":3,"text":"But also, you need to think\nwhat else might happen."},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"Do my kids come\nhome from school?"},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"Do I have to have\ndinner in between,"},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"because dinner\ntime is in between"},"481":{"dur":1,"text":"and I can't read

sounds very complicated,"},"493":{"dur":3,"text":"what I do is if I have a\ntask, I think, OK, this"},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"will take me half an hour."},"499":{"dur":1,"text":"Then I will ask\nmyself the question,"},"500":{"dur":3,"text":"is everything in\nthere in my control?"},"504":{"dur":5,"text":"So is my time, is the task,\neverything in my control?"},"509":{"dur":4,"text":"Yes, then I add just 10%\nfor my own mind wandering."},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"If it is not, because someone\nmight actually come to my house"},"517":{"dur":4,"text":"or in my office, or I need\na response from someone"},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"before I can move on and do the\nsecond part of that same task,"},"525":{"dur":3,"text":"then I add 20% of\ntime to that half hour"},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"that I think it would take me."},"531":{"dur":3,"text":"And that gives you these\nlittle chunks of time"},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"that you most of the\ntime actually do need."},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"But if you don't need them,\nwell, then you can bake a cake."},"540":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Well,\nyes, you could."},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"You sound so, so\nvery, very organised."},"544":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, one thing I do\nknow is that a lot"},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"of the time on these study\nplanners, they'll say,"},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"oh, this will take so long."},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is a one hour activity."},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"And a bit like the\nSatNav - not that I ever"},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"speed - but a bit like\nthe SatNav, I think, oh,"},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"could I do it in\na little bit less?"},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"What would you say about\npeople adjusting and learning"},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"their sort of\ntimes and how those"},"561":{"dur":2,"text":"might work within that\nstudy planner context?"},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"SUSANNE SCHWENZER:\nWell, first of all,"},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"is for those who are\njust starting out,"},"568":{"dur":4,"text":"they need to try and find\nout how long they need."},"572":{"dur":3,"text":"And what I tell my students when\nthey start is, why don't you,"},"576":{"dur":3,"text":"for the first week or\nso, sit down and then"},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"make a little table\non a scrap paper"},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"and say, OK, they\nsay it takes an hour."},"584":{"dur":1,"text":"It actually took me 50 minutes."},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"Or they say this takes\nan hour, and it took me"},"588":{"dur":0,"text":"an hour and a half."},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"So you get a feeling\nfor the tasks first."},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"Because those who\nare new to the OU,"},"594":{"dur":4,"text":"they will figure out within\nprobably the first two to three"},"598":{"dur":4,"text":"weeks how times measure up to\nwhat we think they measure up."},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: And it's a\nreally good point, actually."},"605":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm glad you've\nmentioned going over."},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"Because that's nothing to do\nwith how bright or not you are."},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"It's just how long it\ntakes you to do something."},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's better to read\nsomething thoroughly"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, the amount of times\nthat I've read something"},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"and then I put it down and\nthink, what did I read?"},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"I've read it quickly."},"620":{"dur":1,"text":"I haven't retained any of it."},"621":{"dur":1,"text":"And so it's important that\nyou sort of measure that."},"623":{"dur":1,"text":"I'd like to look\nat what people said"},"625":{"dur":1,"text":"was important in terms\nof time management"},"626":{"dur":1,"text":"so that we can pick\nup on some of these."},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"Because it seems like we've\ngot a very conscientious bunch"},"631":{"dur":0,"text":"of people out there."},"632":{"dur":1,"text":"So Susanne, these are\nsome of the things"},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"that people have\nsaid are important."},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"So these are the three\nmost important things."},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"We've got planning,\nprioritising."},"640":{"dur":2,"text":"Sticky labels are a big\nthing, very important."},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'd like

lot of this, another\nword here is flexibility."},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"So thank you for all of those."},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"This flexibility is a\nreally important thing."},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"So whilst we can\nsort of make our time"},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"and deconstruct our plan, we can\nuse various devices and things"},"663":{"dur":0,"text":"that can help us."},"664":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, people have said\nthey love stationery."},"666":{"dur":1,"text":"They love Post-it\nnotes, et cetera."},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"We've got some various things\nhere that should make life"},"669":{"dur":0,"text":"a breeze."},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, some of these things\nlike these academic wall"},"673":{"dur":1,"text":"planners that you can put on."},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"We have a nice thing\nabout not only putting"},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"the content on here, but\nalso putting tips, et cetera."},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"What would be some of the ways\nthat you would recommend people"},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"might be able to structure\nor use some of these lovely"},"684":{"dur":4,"text":"colourful things like\nhighlighters, a keen favourite,"},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"to actually help\nplan their time?"},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"SUSANNE SCHWENZER:\nWell, what I do"},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"is because time\nmanagement, as you say,"},"694":{"dur":4,"text":"needs to be very flexible and\ntasks come in, first of all,"},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"don't just plan your studies."},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"Plan your life with it."},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"Because otherwise, you will\nhave a constant conflict."},"704":{"dur":3,"text":"If you, for example, need\nto do something else,"},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"you need to bake

that"},"725":{"dur":1,"text":"- but if you have to do\nsomething else that's"},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"really important and that\nyou can't get around,"},"730":{"dur":1,"text":"you need to factor that in."},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"Because not only\nwill you feel bad"},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"if you only get one thing done,\nthe studies or the other task,"},"738":{"dur":2,"text":"but also, if you

and\nyou haven't retained anything."},"748":{"dur":5,"text":"So what I do is I try to\nput everything on my list."},"754":{"dur":0,"text":"And I have one here."},"755":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't know if

colours."},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"So you asked me how you\ncould use these colours."},"784":{"dur":3,"text":"Because it has colours as to\nwhether I have to do something"},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"this
