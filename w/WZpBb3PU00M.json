And when"},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"we see -- and here's one more. I just got\n-- this one's really good."},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"CONGREGATION: (Laughter.)\nBRIAN PHIPPS: For all you mothers out there"},"425":{"dur":6,"text":"on Mother's Day, you know, don't do this.\nCONGREGATION: (Laughter.)"},"431":{"dur":6,"text":"BRIAN PHIPPS: When you see so much warning\nthat really isn't about warning, it's easy"},"438":{"dur":6,"text":"to just have your head go numb from warning.\nCan't it?

I believe that there\nis a -- there's another thing that's making"},"454":{"dur":5,"text":"us go deaf with warning. Words of warning\nwhen they come out -- particularly about God"},"459":{"dur":8,"text":"-- are perceived by many as judgment and dismissed\nwithout a consideration. I mean, listen to"},"467":{"dur":8,"text":"that for a second. It's considered a hate\ncrime to deliver a warning from God. And so"},"475":{"dur":5,"text":"when I think about the value of the prophetic\nvoice and how necessary the prophetic voice"},"481":{"dur":6,"text":"of God is, and I look at our current situation\nand see, one, we're numb from warning because"},"487":{"dur":5,"text":"we get warning stuff that really isn't all\nthat important. And, two, we get any sense"},"492":{"dur":4,"text":"of real warning voice coming at us, and it's\nperceived very quickly as judgment that we"},"496":{"dur":7,"text":"want to dismiss as being uncaring, unloving,\nor whatever the reason is -- we dismiss it."},"504":{"dur":6,"text":"All of a sudden, this very valuable thing\ncalled the prophetic voice can get lost. And"},"510":{"dur":4,"text":"ignoring can kill. Here's one other warning\nsign that's really important. You can see"},"515":{"dur":5,"text":"it here. You've got a tent right underneath\na cliff where a lot of rocks have apparently"},"520":{"dur":6,"text":"fallen in the past. All right? And these people\nhave ignored it."},"526":{"dur":4,"text":"Interesting thing: I was looking up pictures\nto try to use and to demonstrate this. There's"},"531":{"dur":6,"text":"a lot of folks that would ignore the warning\nsigns at the Grand Canyon.

A really strong number of people"},"542":{"dur":8,"text":"have fallen off those cliffs to their peril\nbecause they ignored the warning signs. So"},"551":{"dur":7,"text":"it begs the question for us today: How do\nwe as Jesus's Church -- how do we as Jesus's"},"559":{"dur":6,"text":"people recover the prophetic voice within\nus, how do we continue to welcome the prophetic"},"565":{"dur":6,"text":"voice in us, and how do we actually become\na catalytic change agent where we are a voice"},"571":{"dur":6,"text":"that seasons and salts -- brings flavor and\nlife to our communities, to our cultures,"},"577":{"dur":6,"text":"to our soccer teams, to wherever we are -- in\na way that brings life and joy not just to"},"583":{"dur":4,"text":"us, but to the people around us.\nHere's the big idea for the day. Will you"},"588":{"dur":7,"text":"write it in? I need prophets to point out\nmy distractions before they become destructive."},"595":{"dur":5,"text":"Does anybody else need this here this morning?\nI need prophets to point out my distractions"},"601":{"dur":4,"text":"before they become destructive. So how's this\nfor a fun Mother's Day talk?"},"605":{"dur":5,"text":"CONGREGATION: (Laughter.)\nBRIAN PHIPPS: You enjoying this so far? You"},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"know what? I actually think it's quite appropriate.\nI was sharing this out loud with my wife,"},"613":{"dur":4,"text":"Carol, and she said, \"Hey, the moms are the\nbest prophets there are. Who else checks on"},"617":{"dur":4,"text":"those teenagers? You dads are asleep while\nI'm staying up till 1:30 at night waiting"},"622":{"dur":4,"text":"for them to come home. Who is going to make\nsure that they got the vitamins and the food"},"626":{"dur":5,"text":"that they need? Man, these prophets are it.\"\nMy mother-in-law was notorious for asking"},"631":{"dur":3,"text":"all of her kids if they had their bowel movement\nthat day."},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"CONGREGATION: (Laughter.)\nBRIAN PHIPPS: That's dangerous stuff if you"},"638":{"dur":6,"text":"can't get things moving. All right. I say\nall that very intently, not just to get that"},"645":{"dur":5,"text":"Mother's Day piece in there. But to say listen\nto the heart of a mother. You can't fend a"},"651":{"dur":6,"text":"mother off her kids. That's the heart our\nGod has for us with this prophetic voice."},"658":{"dur":5,"text":"So the first thing we're going to do this\nmorning is to understand the true nature of"},"663":{"dur":6,"text":"a prophet -- understand the true nature of\na prophet. This prophet isn't a guy on the"},"670":{"dur":4,"text":"corner with a sandwich board on him, yelling\ninto a megaphone about how you're going to"},"674":{"dur":6,"text":"hell. That's not the biblical tone of a prophet\nwhatsoever. It's not the Phelps family saying"},"681":{"dur":5,"text":"they hate people. That's not a prophet. Can\nwe just dispel that? Empty our minds of that"},"687":{"dur":6,"text":"picture and go and look and see what the scriptures\nactually have to say about the prophetic voice."},"693":{"dur":7,"text":"First, it's this: Prophets identified distractions.\nWe're talking about how the invitation moves"},"700":{"dur":4,"text":"to distraction; distraction moves to destruction.\nThe prophets were actually very helpful in"},"704":{"dur":5,"text":"identifying distractions. Look what the verse\nsays here in the book of Amos. It says, \"They"},"709":{"dur":4,"text":"sell honorable people for silver and poor\npeople for a pair of sandals. They trample"},"714":{"dur":5,"text":"helpless people in the dust and shove the\noppressed out of the way. Both father and"},"719":{"dur":5,"text":"son sleep with the same woman, corrupting\nmy holy name.\" Amos, just right here in this"},"725":{"dur":4,"text":"small section of scripture, identifies three\nmajor distractions that the nation of Israel"},"729":{"dur":6,"text":"had. The first one is trafficking of people.\nNothing new under the sun. Amos is saying"},"736":{"dur":4,"text":"that's not God's plan. That's going to tear\nup your society. The second thing was a great"},"741":{"dur":6,"text":"sense of injustice that was going on. You\ncan't have that. Any of this new by the way?"},"747":{"dur":4,"text":"Same things under the sun. And then, of course,\nsexual immorality is going on. And what Amos"},"752":{"dur":6,"text":"is doing is pointing those things out. Guys,\nthese are off target, but they're happening"},"758":{"dur":6,"text":"in big numbers. We've got to change this.\nWe are invited to fix that, not participate"},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"in it.\nNow, I've had a couple interesting phrases"},"767":{"dur":4,"text":"come up in my head when I was looking back\nthrough these notes yesterday. The prophets"},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"-- write this somewhere in your margins. I\ndon't have it in the blanks. The prophets"},"775":{"dur":7,"text":"were specific, not spiteful, in their tone.\nThey pointed out specific distractions. They"},"783":{"dur":4,"text":"weren't spiteful. They weren't saying, \"You're\nidiots and you're losers.\" They were being"},"787":{"dur":5,"text":"very specific about the things that were going\nwrong, the distractions. Does that make sense?"},"793":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's part of the tone. They were very\nspecific, and they were very clear about these"},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"things.\nSecond thing here: The prophets entreated"},"798":{"dur":5,"text":"people to return to God. They entreated them\nto return to God. They didn't just say, \"Hey,"},"804":{"dur":4,"text":"you might want to try this.\" They say, \"Hey,\nthis is really serious. You need to return"},"808":{"dur":5,"text":"to God.\" Look what it says in 2 Chronicles:\n\"The Lord sent prophets to condemn the people"},"813":{"dur":5,"text":"and make them feel bad.\" You see that there?\nFor those of you who don't have notes that"},"819":{"dur":4,"text":"you're looking at or a verse, it did not say\nthat. Here's what it said: \"The Lord sent"},"823":{"dur":6,"text":"prophets to bring them back to him. The prophets\nwarned them, but still the people would not"},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"listen.\"\nWrite this one in the blank, if you will:"},"832":{"dur":6,"text":"Prophets invite; they don't indite. They invite.\nThey offer an invitation, not a condemnation."},"839":{"dur":6,"text":"However you want to say that, they invite\npeople back to God. They don't alienate. They"},"845":{"dur":4,"text":"try to restore.\nNumber three: Prophets reminded people of"},"850":{"dur":6,"text":"God's redemption. I love the book of Hosea.\nIt's one of the graphic pictures of how bad"},"856":{"dur":5,"text":"God's people had strayed away from him. Actually,\nhe uses a picture of a man who's told to go"},"862":{"dur":6,"text":"marry a prostitute. You know, that's tough,\nand that's a picture of God and his people."},"868":{"dur":3,"text":"Hosea's done that. But even at the very end\nof that, Hosea says this: \"My people will"},"872":{"dur":7,"text":"again live under my shade. They will flourish\nlike grain and blossom like grape vines.\""},"879":{"dur":5,"text":"After this indictment, after this invitation\nback because of all the things that they were"},"885":{"dur":6,"text":"doing wrong, God reminds them through Hosea\nthat, \"Hey, this is my plan for you -- abundance,"},"891":{"dur":6,"text":"beauty, hope, joy, restoration.\"\nThis is the phrase that came to mind. It's"},"897":{"dur":6,"text":"a thing of hope, not hate. The prophetic voice\nis a voice of hope, not hate. God has a better"},"904":{"dur":4,"text":"plan for you. Jesus says in John 10:10, \"I\ncame that you might have life and have it"},"908":{"dur":6,"text":"to the full.\" Why would you choose broken,\nsinful carbohydrates when you could have rich,"},"914":{"dur":5,"text":"abundant protein through life and my spirit,\nyou know? It's hope. It's not hate. Boy, I"},"920":{"dur":5,"text":"wish the world would hear this. Do you? But\nthis is the prophetic voice. It's hope. It's"},"926":{"dur":6,"text":"not hate.\nFinally, prophets are a gift from God. There's"},"932":{"dur":4,"text":"a verse in the scripture I chose not to use,\nbut it basically says -- it's a lamenting"},"937":{"dur":6,"text":"cry of one of the psalmists who says the prophets\nare all gone, and we don't know when they'll"},"943":{"dur":5,"text":"come back. They realized that that voice had\nbeen lost in their time, and they needed that"},"949":{"dur":5,"text":"voice in order to have hope for their future.\nLook what the Bible says in Ephesians, Chapter"},"955":{"dur":4,"text":"4: \"Now these are the gifts\" -- circle that\nword \"gifts\" if you will. \"These are the gifts"},"959":{"dur":6,"text":"Jesus gave to the church: The apostles\" -- and\nthen here's ours -- \"the prophets, the evangelists,"},"966":{"dur":9,"text":"and the pastors, and the teachers.\" God has\ngiven us prophets. He's wired certain people"},"976":{"dur":7,"text":"to be that prophetic voice. But he's charged\nall of us to have a piece of it. Does that"},"983":{"dur":4,"text":"make sense? So I'll pull a Southerland here\nand say, \"Look at your neighbor and say, 'You're"},"987":{"dur":2,"text":"a prophet, and I need you to be.'\" Go ahead.\nTell them."},"990":{"dur":2,"text":"CONGREGATION: (Laughter.)\nBRIAN PHIPPS: \"You're a prophet, and I need"},"992":{"dur":5,"text":"you to be.\"\nAll right. Here's where we're going now. Going"},"998":{"dur":6,"text":"to challenge all of us to look at this information\nabout the prophets. The challenge is, first,"},"1004":{"dur":5,"text":"to be a helpful prophet to the people around\nus. And then we're going to talk about how"},"1009":{"dur":5,"text":"to receive the prophetic voice. Because I\nbelieve if God's people do understand the"},"1014":{"dur":5,"text":"true nature of a prophet, and I believe that\nif we're willing to be that helpful prophet"},"1020":{"dur":6,"text":"for other people, and we're willing to accept\nit, what happens to God's people when there's"},"1026":{"dur":7,"text":"fewer distractions that lead to destruction?\nCan you see it? How many families around you"},"1034":{"dur":3,"text":"in your neighborhood and how many families\naround you in the things that you do where"},"1037":{"dur":5,"text":"you live, work, and play where you see carnage\nin families over and over again? You see it."},"1042":{"dur":6,"text":"All right. Well, what if God would lead a\npeople to stop -- he's not going to lead us"},"1049":{"dur":6,"text":"to stop our distractions. I am prone to distraction;\nwe all are. The Bible is really nice about"},"1055":{"dur":5,"text":"saying, \"Hey, I know. You don't have to fake\nit anymore.\" We're all prone to distraction,"},"1060":{"dur":4,"text":"but God's given us the gift of these prophets\nto bring us back before the distraction hits"},"1065":{"dur":4,"text":"the destruction, and the carnage is there.\nI don't know about you, but I got people coming"},"1069":{"dur":5,"text":"and asking me, \"Phipps, how is it that you\nactually love your teenage children? How did"},"1074":{"dur":5,"text":"that work out? What did you do?\" I mean, they\nlove to spend time just asking these questions."},"1079":{"dur":4,"text":"\"How is it that you and Carol have remained\nmarried for 22 years and actually enjoy being"},"1084":{"dur":5,"text":"together?\" This is what would happen. It's\nwhat is already happening, but what can happen"},"1089":{"dur":6,"text":"more and more as the statistics between the\nfamily of God and the statistics of the rest"},"1095":{"dur":7,"text":"of the world start to have a gap between them.\nYou following me? This is the measure of God"},"1103":{"dur":5,"text":"working in his people. And it's a beautiful\nthing. Let's write it in the blank. Be a helpful"},"1108":{"dur":4,"text":"prophet for others. Be a helpful prophet for\nothers."},"1113":{"dur":4,"text":"If you somehow leave this morning with a license\nto go wallop people upside the head with the"},"1118":{"dur":5,"text":"Bible, you missed.

It starts with encouragement."},"1196":{"dur":4,"text":"You see someone distracted, the first thing\nthat you do is ask something like this, \"Is"},"1201":{"dur":5,"text":"everything okay? How can I help? Looks like\nyou're distracted? Everything good at work?"},"1206":{"dur":3,"text":"Everything's good at home? What's going on?\"\nYou know? Does that make sense?
