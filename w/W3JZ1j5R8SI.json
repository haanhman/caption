sexy."},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"But it just happens\nto do a lot more good."},"377":{"dur":4,"text":"So really what we tried to\ndo is to set priorities."},"381":{"dur":3,"text":"But setting priorities-- I mean\nin principle, everybody agrees."},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"Yes, we should do the things\nthat will do the most good."},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"But in reality, of\ncourse, that also"},"390":{"dur":1,"text":"means when you say\nthis should come first,"},"391":{"dur":1,"text":"this should come\nsecond, it also means"},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"you have to say something\nshould

mention it."},"415":{"dur":3,"text":"And, of course, the people\nwho advocate the things"},"419":{"dur":1,"text":"at the bottom will\njust say we're stupid,"},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"and you shouldn't listen to\nus, and all that kind of stuff."},"424":{"dur":0,"text":"It's very obvious."},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"But it also engenders\na lot of controversy."},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"But at the end of the day, I\nthink we need to ask ourselves"},"430":{"dur":1,"text":"where can we do the most good?"},"432":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's really what I want\nto talk to you about and have"},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"you try and help us with doing."},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"So these are the 10 challenges\nwe looked at last year."},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"We do this every four years."},"442":{"dur":3,"text":"So we did the last one in 2012,\nwhere we get about a hundred"},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"of the world's top\neconomists to look across"},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"all these different areas."},"448":{"dur":0,"text":"We have lots of teams."},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll talk a little bit\nmore about the process."},"451":{"dur":1,"text":"But fundamentally,\nthese are the

also got to prioritize."},"472":{"dur":3,"text":"So we've sort of said we're\nonly going to look at 10."},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"But these are\ndefinitely big issues."},"477":{"dur":1,"text":"A typical sort of\njournalist question"},"479":{"dur":3,"text":"is then to say, well, so,\nof these big problems,"},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"which problem is the biggest?"},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"It's sort of a very\nnatural question?"},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"It also turns out to be wrong."},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not a well-formed question."},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"You can't ask what's the\nbiggest problem without knowing"},"493":{"dur":1,"text":"that there's a solution."},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean arguably the biggest\nproblem in the world"},"496":{"dur":1,"text":"is that we all die."},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"But we don't have a\ngood solution to that."},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"And economists would say we\nhave a severe undersupply"},"502":{"dur":1,"text":"of immortality."},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"But we don't quite\nknow how to fix that."},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"So the issue here is not to\nsay what's the biggest problem?"},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"We need to look at what\nare the smartest solutions?"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you look at armed\nconflicts, for instance,"},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"you could go in and say should\nwe do conflict prevention?"},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"Should we have peacekeeping\nforces for the UN?"},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"What are the solutions?"},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"And then what we tried\nto do is to say, well,"},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"how much with that\nsolution cost,"},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"and what's the likelihood\nthat it will work,"},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"and how much good would\nthat solution then do?"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're basically saying\nhow much money would you"},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"spend, how much good\nwould you end up doing?"},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"Likewise for biodiversity, maybe\nwe should protect more areas."},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"Right now, we have\nprotected about 12%"},"541":{"dur":1,"text":"of the Earth's surface."},"542":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe we should protect more."},"543":{"dur":1,"text":"How much will that cost?"},"544":{"dur":1,"text":"How much good will it do?"},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"Obviously, it won't\nmostly be measured"},"548":{"dur":3,"text":"in lives saved because it's\nnot really about human lives."},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"But it's about the\nfact that we all"},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"like the idea that there will\nbe more biodiversity preserved"},"556":{"dur":1,"text":"for future generations."},"558":{"dur":1,"text":"Likewise with chronic\ndisease, maybe we"},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"should have a tobacco tax."},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"One fun fact is that\nin the 20th century,"},"565":{"dur":4,"text":"we estimated about 100 million\npeople died from tobacco."},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"In the 21st century-- mostly\nbecause China and India are"},"573":{"dur":3,"text":"smoking like crazy--\nwe are actually"},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"estimating on current\ntrends, we will"},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"lose about a billion\npeople to tobacco."},"582":{"dur":1,"text":"So maybe we should do\nsomething about that."},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe we should have\na heart attack pill."},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"So these are very cheap."},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"We know how to deal with\nthem in developed countries."},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"As developing countries\nare increasingly"},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"avoiding infectious\ndiseases, maybe we"},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"should start getting\nmore heart attack pills."},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"A lot of people die from a heart\nattack in the developing world."},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"And on and on, there\nare lots and lots"},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"of solutions for\nall of these areas."},"602":{"dur":1,"text":"It makes it more complicated."},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"But it also makes a lot more\ninteresting because we're not"},"606":{"dur":3,"text":"talking about is a problem, a\nbig problem or a small problem?"},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"But we're talking\nabout are there"},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"good solutions or bad solutions?"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"And typically, there are\nboth good and bad solutions"},"616":{"dur":1,"text":"to pretty much all of these."},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's about finding\nthe good solutions"},"620":{"dur":1,"text":"to the big problems\nin the world."},"622":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's really what I\nwant to get you involved in."},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"So let me just talk a little\nbit about how we do this."},"628":{"dur":3,"text":"We team up with some of\nthe world's top economists."},"631":{"dur":1,"text":"For instance, on the\ninfectious disease,"},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"we worked with Dean\nJamison, who has basically"},"636":{"dur":3,"text":"written the manual for the\nWorld Health Organization, about"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"305 diseases in\nthe world and what"},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"their cost and benefits are."},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"He has a team of\neconomists behind him."},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"So he goes in and looks at a\nlot of different solutions."},"648":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm just going to\nlook at three of them."},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"And again, I'm just going to\ndo them very, very quickly."},"652":{"dur":4,"text":"He looks at tuberculosis,\nHIV vaccine, and malaria."},"656":{"dur":3,"text":"But he doesn't just\nsay, this is important."},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"He says, for every dollar\nyou spend on tuberculosis"},"663":{"dur":4,"text":"on the DOTS approach, which\nis basically getting people"},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"medicine, but making\nsure they keep taking it."},"670":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't know if\nyou've ever-- I mean"},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"it's a problem in many places."},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"But if you get medicine from\nyour doctor, once you get good,"},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"it's hard to remember to\nkeep taking the medicine far"},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"out-- a long time after\nyou've gotten gone well again."},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's the problem\nwas with tuberculosis."},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"You actually need to\ntake your medication"},"686":{"dur":1,"text":"for a very long time."},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"You also need to make sure\nthat you're actually cured."},"690":{"dur":4,"text":"That it wasn't a variant\nthat was actually"},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"resistant to the\nmedicine you got."},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"So with all that, and with\nthe smartest approaches,"},"699":{"dur":3,"text":"they estimate that for every\ndollar spent in tuberculosis,"},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"you will do about\n$15 worth of good."},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"That's pretty fantastic."},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"On HIV vaccine, they\nestimate-- and this"},"708":{"dur":3,"text":"was the first cost\/benefit\nfor HIV vaccine ever done--"},"711":{"dur":1,"text":"they estimate that for\nevery dollar spent,"},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"you will do about\n$11 worth of good."},"715":{"dur":3,"text":"For malaria, $1 will\ndo $35 worth of good."},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"Suddenly you get a\nvery different approach"},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"to understanding these\nare not just good things,"},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"but some of them are\nphenomenal things."},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"Of course, we also need to\nhave a conversation about what"},"728":{"dur":1,"text":"went into those numbers."},"729":{"dur":1,"text":"Do we believe those numbers?"},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"When you ask an academic,\nthey'll come up with answers."},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"But obviously, they're\nnot the true answer."},"736":{"dur":5,"text":"So we actually asked two other\ngroups of academics, also"},"741":{"dur":3,"text":"economists, to give\nperspectives on this."},"744":{"dur":1,"text":"And basically, he\ntells you, yeah,"},"745":{"dur":1,"text":"but= their model\noverestimates this,"},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"the cost is underestimated\nhere, all these kinds of things."},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"So we actually hear a broad\nsort of range of conversations"},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"on what will work\nand what won't."},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"Then we do this for all\nthe different panels."},"760":{"dur":1,"text":"And then we have\nan expert panel."},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"Last time, we had\nfour Nobel laureates."},"764":{"dur":1,"text":"We're listening to\nall of these guys,"},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"listening to all the arguments,\nand then basically prioritizing"},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"across all these\ndifferent areas."},"771":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's essentially what I'd\nlike to have you do here today."},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"I have physical strips\nfor you here in the room."},"776":{"dur":4,"text":"The ones who are following\non the internet, I'm sorry,"},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"you'll have to make\nup your own strips."},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"But basically, I want to give\nyou the exact same technology"},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"that we have with the Nobels."},"789":{"dur":4,"text":"Here, if you could\njust distribute this."},"793":{"dur":4,"text":"And these were actually\ncut in Beijing."},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"I just gave a talk at the\nPeking University there."},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"So essentially, I\njust have these."},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"And I was told that we only\nhave about 45 minutes because we"},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"wanted to have\nquestions and answers."},"811":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm actually going to cut\nout one of these solutions"},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"because it takes a long\ntime to explain it."},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"So we'll just be using\nsix of these solutions."},"819":{"dur":4,"text":"And I basically just want you\nto help prioritize these issues."},"823":{"dur":3,"text":"So if we can just take\na look at some of these."},"826":{"dur":4,"text":"Again, this was the list of the\nsolutions that I showed you."},"831":{"dur":1,"text":"I'd love to go through\nall of them with you."},"833":{"dur":2,"text":"But again, we have\na very limited time."},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"So I just want to give\nyou the gist of this idea"},"838":{"dur":3,"text":"and just take a look at\nthree of the problems."},"842":{"dur":1,"text":"So let's just take\na look at three"},"843":{"dur":2,"text":"of the challenges,\nclimate change, education,"},"845":{"dur":1,"text":"and hunger and malnutrition."},"847":{"dur":2,"text":"I've taken them because I'm\nsure this is some of things that"},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"would interest you, and\nthat would be exciting,"},"851":{"dur":2,"text":"and that will also make for\nsort of a good comparison."},"854":{"dur":1,"text":"But obviously, we\ncould have looked"},"855":{"dur":1,"text":"at lot of different things."},"856":{"dur":2,"text":"And essentially, of course,\nyou should look at everything."},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"If you really had $75 billion,\nyou probably wouldn't

let's"},"2756":{"dur":3,"text":"pay teachers-- let's keep good\nteachers and fire bad teachers."},"2759":{"dur":2,"text":"It turns out that that's\nactually both very, very hard"},"2762":{"dur":2,"text":"to do, as you've\ndiscovered in the US."},"2764":{"dur":2,"text":"But also that it's\nvery hard to show."},"2767":{"dur":2,"text":"There's typically\nvery little

we're going to pay you\naccording to your test results."},"2777":{"dur":1,"text":"But we've tried that."},"2779":{"dur":2,"text":"And the typical outcome\nis that then the teachers"},"2782":{"dur":2,"text":"Or even worse, they\ncheat on the test."},"2785":{"dur":3,"text":"So it turns out to be\nreally, really hard to do."},"2789":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's one good\nsolution-- and that's actually"},"2791":{"dur":3,"text":"the best solution that\nwe have-- is nutrition."},"2795":{"dur":1,"text":"That was one we\nlooked at before."},"2796":{"dur":2,"text":"Surprisingly, nutrition\ndoesn't do anything"},"2799":{"dur":1,"text":"about schooling quality."},"2800":{"dur":1,"text":"But essentially,\nbecause it

yes,\nit's not an ideal solution."},"2808":{"dur":1,"text":"But it's a pretty good solution."},"2810":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a great way to get more\nout of being bad schools."},"2813":{"dur":1,"text":"But I'm going to show you two."},"2815":{"dur":3,"text":"So nutrition is actually what\nmost education economists"},"2818":{"dur":3,"text":"come out and say is probably\nthe best investment in education"},"2821":{"dur":2,"text":"because we know it works\nand it's sort of a way"},"2824":{"dur":2,"text":"around not trying to\ndeal with schools."},"2826":{"dur":1,"text":"But there are two other ways."},"2828":{"dur":1,"text":"One is conditional\ncash transfers."},"2830":{"dur":2,"text":"That's the first\nsolution that you have."},"2832":{"dur":1,"text":"This is essentially\npaying parents"},"2834":{"dur":2,"text":"to send their kids to school."},"2837":{"dur":1,"text":"It's something we know works."},"2838":{"dur":1,"text":"It's been very,\nvery well studied,"},"2839":{"dur":3,"text":"mostly in the Latin America."},"2843":{"dur":2,"text":"But even Bloomberg tried\nit out in New

thing."},"2851":{"dur":4,"text":"We also know it increases\nattendance significantly,"},"2856":{"dur":3,"text":"but not dramatically\nby any means."},"2859":{"dur":2,"text":"A large part of the\nbenefit is actually"},"2862":{"dur":1,"text":"that it improves health."},"2863":{"dur":3,"text":"Because if you pay--\nespecially to poor parents,"},"2867":{"dur":2,"text":"especially if you pay\nto women, so the mothers"},"2869":{"dur":1,"text":"and in the family,\nthey will spend"},"2871":{"dur":2,"text":"part of that money\non the kid's health."},"2873":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, that's not\nreally schooling."},"2874":{"dur":1,"text":"But it's still good."},"2876":{"dur":3,"text":"So it will actually end up,\nover all, being a good thing."},"2879":{"dur":2,"text":"The total benefit\/cost\nratio is 5.2."},"2882":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's a nice thing."},"2883":{"dur":2,"text":"But it's not a\nphenomenal outcome."},"2886":{"dur":4,"text":"Mostly because this is\nstill just on quantity."},"2890":{"dur":3,"text":"We're not actually dealing\nwith the basic problem"},"2893":{"dur":1,"text":"of improving quality."},"2894":{"dur":1,"text":"We're just simply\nimproving quantity."},"2896":{"dur":2,"text":"We're getting more\nkids into schools"},"2898":{"dur":1,"text":"that pretty much are still bad."},"2900":{"dur":4,"text":"And the reason why it's not\na better benefit\/cost ratio"},"2904":{"dur":2,"text":"is because we have\nto pay all parents."},"2906":{"dur":2,"text":"Most parents would still have\nsend their kids to school"},"2909":{"dur":1,"text":"even if we haven't paid them."},"2910":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're basically\npaying every one"},"2912":{"dur":2,"text":"to get a little\nincrease in attendance."},"2915":{"dur":2,"text":"And yes, then we get the\nbetter health outcomes."},"2917":{"dur":2,"text":"Actually, about three of\nthe five comes from health."},"2920":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is mostly\nactually a transfer"},"2923":{"dur":3,"text":"of money to poor families,\nwhich is still good."},"2927":{"dur":2,"text":"But it's not got all that\nmuch to do with education."},"2930":{"dur":1,"text":"But one of things\nthat it really shows"},"2931":{"dur":3,"text":"is we're don't know very\nwell what works in education."},"2935":{"dur":3,"text":"Which, of course, is one of the\nreasons why the West is also"},"2938":{"dur":1,"text":"having this huge discussion."},"2939":{"dur":1,"text":"You have a discussion\nabout how are"},"2940":{"dur":1,"text":"we going to make schools

this."},"2947":{"dur":2,"text":"So again, mostly\nquantity, not quality."},"2950":{"dur":2,"text":"The second solution\nis what I think"},"2952":{"dur":1,"text":"is a phenomenally\ninteresting one."},"2954":{"dur":2,"text":"But it will have\nanother issue that I"},"2956":{"dur":2,"text":"think is rampant in many\nof these conversations."},"2959":{"dur":3,"text":"We don't know enough about\nthe solution right now."},"2962":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is more sort of a\ngambling solution for you."},"2965":{"dur":3,"text":"It's essentially the idea\nof an information campaign."},"2969":{"dur":3,"text":"Most kids that\nlive in rural areas"},"2973":{"dur":3,"text":"have no idea what's\nthe value of education."},"2976":{"dur":1,"text":"Because the only\neducated person they"},"2978":{"dur":3,"text":"see is the teacher\nin this village."},"2981":{"dur":3,"text":"And he or she is typically\nnot very well paid."},"2985":{"dur":2,"text":"So the

you"},"2994":{"dur":4,"text":"probably will, when you grow\nup, if you have a high school"},"2998":{"dur":2,"text":"education compared to if\nyou don't have a high

the significant cost."},"3082":{"dur":1,"text":"But they have been\npeer reviewed."},"3084":{"dur":2,"text":"The other one is the\nDominican Republic,"},"3086":{"dur":2,"text":"which had a much more sort\nof sensible benefit\/cost"},"3089":{"dur":3,"text":"ratio of about $13, so\nin between $8 and $19."},"3093":{"dur":2,"text":"So the real issue\nhere is to say we"},"3095":{"dur":3,"text":"don't

sense"},"3109":{"dur":1,"text":"you'd just have to\nlive with the fact"},"3110":{"dur":1,"text":"that we only have two studies."},"3112":{"dur":2,"text":"And you have to decide do\nI want to sort of

day,\nthese are not great outcomes."},"3122":{"dur":3,"text":"One of things I also wanted\nto show with using education"},"3126":{"dur":2,"text":"is essentially that some\nsolutions are really,"},"3128":{"dur":1,"text":"really good and very obvious."},"3130":{"dur":1,"text":"And you probably haven't\nheard about them."},"3131":{"dur":2,"text":"Other areas, like education,\nwe talk a
