book,"},"69":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Why Nations Fail,\" and then I\nthink people can ask questions"},"72":{"dur":2,"text":"and things like that."},"74":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's lots of different\nways of talking about this."},"77":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll introduce the\nargument in the book."},"79":{"dur":1,"text":"And in the book,\nthe first chapter"},"81":{"dur":3,"text":"is about the long run

is"},"96":{"dur":2,"text":"about is to look\nat this photograph"},"99":{"dur":3,"text":"of the Korean\npeninsula at night."},"102":{"dur":1,"text":"And you can see quite a\nfew things about this."},"104":{"dur":2,"text":"Because in South Korea,\nthere's lots of electricity,"},"106":{"dur":0,"text":"and light bulbs."},"107":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's very bright."},"109":{"dur":3,"text":"And North Korea is very dark."},"112":{"dur":4,"text":"You can see a little spot\nof light there in Pyongyang."},"116":{"dur":3,"text":"It's probably the

see that."},"131":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a lot of electricity\nand light in South Korea,"},"133":{"dur":1,"text":"and not very much\nin North Korea."},"135":{"dur":4,"text":"And this is a very

that's not going to\nbe the distinction, OK?"},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"So what is the difference\nbetween North Korea and South"},"223":{"dur":0,"text":"Korea?"},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, South Korea has a\nlot of technology, OK?"},"226":{"dur":3,"text":"So here you can see it\nhas electricity and light"},"229":{"dur":3,"text":"bulbs, not very new technology,\nbut it has a lot of technology."},"233":{"dur":1,"text":"And economists have\nknown since the work"},"235":{"dur":2,"text":"of Robert Solow in\nthe 1950s that what"},"238":{"dur":4,"text":"drives economic development\nover the long run is innovation."},"242":{"dur":2,"text":"So I don't need to say that\nto people sitting in Google,"},"245":{"dur":2,"text":"It's all about innovation,\nabout new technologies,"},"248":{"dur":3,"text":"raising living standards,\nraising productivity."},"251":{"dur":3,"text":"So what Solow showed\nis that that drove long"},"255":{"dur":1,"text":"run economic development."},"256":{"dur":1,"text":"And if you look around\nthe world today,"},"257":{"dur":1,"text":"and you say what's\nthe difference"},"259":{"dur":3,"text":"in some kind of accounting\nsense between poor countries"},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"and rich countries, it's\nthat poor countries just"},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"don't use all of\nthis technology that"},"267":{"dur":2,"text":"has such incredibly positive\nconsequences for living"},"270":{"dur":1,"text":"standards and productivity."},"272":{"dur":4,"text":"Like, they don't use electricity\nand light bulbs in North Korea."},"276":{"dur":0,"text":"OK?"},"277":{"dur":0,"text":"Why is that?"},"278":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not something mysterious."},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"I mentioned light\nbulbs and electricity"},"282":{"dur":1,"text":"being around a long time."},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not that Google\njust invented it,"},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"and the North Koreans\nhaven't heard about it yet."},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"So this has been around\nfor a long, long time,"},"290":{"dur":2,"text":"but somehow they\njust don't use it."},"293":{"dur":1,"text":"So why is that?"},"294":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, the book provides a simple\nway of thinking about that."},"298":{"dur":6,"text":"And going back to innovation\nand technological change,"},"305":{"dur":3,"text":"what Robert Solow called\ntotal factor productivity,"},"308":{"dur":4,"text":"makes you ask what drives\nthese differences between North"},"313":{"dur":3,"text":"Korea and South Korea?"},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's got something\nto do with the way"},"318":{"dur":1,"text":"the economy is organized."},"320":{"dur":3,"text":"So, yes, I said it's not about\nsocialism and capitalism,"},"324":{"dur":3,"text":"but it is about the way\nthese different countries are"},"327":{"dur":0,"text":"organized."},"328":{"dur":1,"text":"What's interesting\nabout the Korean case,"},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"of course, is that North Korea\nand South Korea were pretty"},"332":{"dur":3,"text":"similar 50, 60 years ago."},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"So this divergence is\nnot some deep, long run"},"338":{"dur":1,"text":"historical thing."},"339":{"dur":2,"text":"It's something that\nhappened pretty recently."},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"And the most obvious reason,\nI think, why it happened"},"344":{"dur":2,"text":"is that North and South\nKorea got organized"},"347":{"dur":1,"text":"in very different ways."},"348":{"dur":3,"text":"The economy got organized\nin very different ways."},"351":{"dur":3,"text":"And in South Korea,\na society emerged"},"354":{"dur":3,"text":"where there were incentives\nand opportunities for people"},"358":{"dur":1,"text":"who wanted to\ninnovate, who wanted"},"359":{"dur":1,"text":"to create new technologies."},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"And in North Korea, there\nwere neither incentives"},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"nor opportunities\nfor anyone who wanted"},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"to do anything like that."},"368":{"dur":4,"text":"So I think the\ncommunism-socialism captures"},"372":{"dur":3,"text":"some idea about\nopportunities and incentives,"},"375":{"dur":4,"text":"but the whole problem is\nmuch different from that,"},"379":{"dur":5,"text":"and much more general than\ncommunism versus capitalism."},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"So big differences in\neconomic development,"},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"big differences in\nthe use of technology,"},"390":{"dur":3,"text":"big differences in people's\nincentives and opportunities."},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm gonna come back also to\nthe last layer of it, which"},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"is gonna be, how come\nNorth Korea and South"},"399":{"dur":1,"text":"Korea got organized like that?"},"400":{"dur":3,"text":"How come in South Korea a\nsociety got organized which"},"404":{"dur":2,"text":"created incentives and\nopportunities for people"},"406":{"dur":3,"text":"to innovate and adopt technology\nand North Korea didn't?"},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's also,\nobviously, something"},"412":{"dur":3,"text":"to do with the politics\nof those societies."},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"So in the book, the book is\nabout comparative economic"},"418":{"dur":1,"text":"development."},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"It says, there's\nthese layers of trying"},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"to understand comparative\neconomic development."},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"There's the economic\nlayer, innovation,"},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"technological change,\nwhat induces that?"},"429":{"dur":1,"text":"What creates very\ndifferent patterns"},"431":{"dur":1,"text":"of that in different countries?"},"433":{"dur":3,"text":"But then lying behind that is a\ndeeper question in some sense,"},"436":{"dur":3,"text":"which is why is it that\nsome societies got organized"},"439":{"dur":3,"text":"in a way that creates\nincentives and opportunities,"},"442":{"dur":4,"text":"and other societies\ndidn't, or don't?"},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"So maybe I shouldn't show who\nthis gentleman is in Google,"},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"but I couldn't resist\nthe temptation."},"451":{"dur":1,"text":"Let me give you\nanother example which"},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"does come up in the first book."},"454":{"dur":1,"text":"So I talked about it\nin the first chapter."},"456":{"dur":1,"text":"I talked about North\nKorea, South Korea."},"457":{"dur":1,"text":"Let me give you\nanother example we use,"},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"which has got us into a bit\nof trouble, which is the two"},"462":{"dur":1,"text":"richest men in the world."},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"I know fortunes go up and down,\nbut they're usually up there"},"465":{"dur":3,"text":"in the top three or four--\nBill Gates and Carlos"},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"Slim in Mexico."},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"So what we get you to think\nabout in the first chapter"},"474":{"dur":5,"text":"of the book is it's very telling\nto understand why the United"},"480":{"dur":3,"text":"States is more economically\nsuccessful than Mexico,"},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"say, to think about how\nCarlos Slim and Bill"},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"Gates made their money."},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"Bill Gates made his\nmoney by innovating."},"491":{"dur":1,"text":"This picture is\nvery significant."},"492":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm gonna come back\nto it in a second."},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"Bill Gates made his\nmoney by innovating."},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"Carlos Slim made his\nmoney with monopolies."},"500":{"dur":4,"text":"Bill Gates, he made a\nfortune, but he also"},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"created a lot of wealth\nfor other people."},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"He created lots of\npositive externalities"},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"in the computer industry."},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"So he created a lot\nmore wealth than he"},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"himself was able to grab."},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"Carlos Slim,\naccording to the OECD,"},"518":{"dur":3,"text":"reduced GDP in Mexico\nby about 2% a year."},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is a very conservative\nkind of deadweight."},"525":{"dur":3,"text":"For the economists in the room,\ndeadweight losses of monopoly"},"528":{"dur":3,"text":"reduces the Mexican\nGDP by about 2% a year."},"531":{"dur":3,"text":"So he actually reduced GDP in\nMexico, according to the OECD,"},"535":{"dur":1,"text":"by more than his own fortune."},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's not just a matter of\ntaking wealth from Mexicans"},"540":{"dur":1,"text":"and giving it to him."},"541":{"dur":3,"text":"It's actually reducing\nincome in Mexico."},"544":{"dur":4,"text":"So in the US, innovation,\nyou make a lot of money."},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"It has all these spillovers."},"550":{"dur":3,"text":"In Mexico, the way to make\nmoney is not through innovation."},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"The way to make money\nis to get monopolies,"},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"and that actually\nmakes you very rich,"},"558":{"dur":4,"text":"but it actually reduces the\nprosperity of the society."},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is the United\nStates and Mexico,"},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"but I want you to think\nthis is really what goes on"},"568":{"dur":1,"text":"in North Korea and South Korea."},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"In both cases, you have\neconomies, some of which"},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"are designed to create\nincentives and opportunities"},"577":{"dur":5,"text":"for innovation, but\nother ones where you have"},"582":{"dur":3,"text":"very different incentives,\nvery different opportunities,"},"585":{"dur":3,"text":"with very different\nconsequences for the economy."},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, I said Carlos\nSlim was a monopolist"},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"and Bill Gates was an innovator."},"594":{"dur":3,"text":"But of course, this\nis not about people."},"597":{"dur":1,"text":"This is about systems."},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"Bill Gates wanted to\nbe a monopolist too."},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"Everyone wants to\nbe a monopolist."},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"Professors want to be\nintellectual monopolists."},"605":{"dur":1,"text":"Google, heaven forbid,\nthey'd probably"},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"like to be a monopolist too,\nif they could get away with it."},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"But this is Bill\nGates giving evidence"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"to the US antitrust authorities."},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"This is, I swear to tell\nthe truth, the whole truth,"},"617":{"dur":1,"text":"and nothing but the truth."},"619":{"dur":4,"text":"So here politics starts\nseeping in as well."},"624":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's not just that there's\nincentives and opportunities"},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"in some places and\nnot in other places,"},"629":{"dur":1,"text":"but there's a\nsystem, what we call"},"631":{"dur":1,"text":"institutions in social science."},"633":{"dur":3,"text":"There's a system of institutions\nthat creates and sustains"},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"those incentives and\nthose opportunities."},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"And that involves, in\nthis case, the state."},"640":{"dur":3,"text":"It involves the implementation\nof antitrust policy,"},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's an old\nstory in the US."},"646":{"dur":3,"text":"This is a contemporary\ncartoon from early"},"650":{"dur":3,"text":"in the last century, the octopus\nof the Standard Oil Company."},"653":{"dur":3,"text":"So the Standard Oil Company was\none of the big, famous trusts,"},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"Rockefeller's trust."},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"And here it is,\nwith its tentacles"},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"around Congress and\nthe White House."},"664":{"dur":4,"text":"And this was the robber\nbarons, the first age"},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"of great monopolization\nin the US economy"},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"in the late 19th century."},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"And what as the consequence\nof the robber barons?"},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"The consequence was\nthe origin of antitrust"},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"and indeed, the\nStandard Oil Company"},"680":{"dur":5,"text":"was broken up by US antitrust as\nwas Bell Telephones, et cetera,"},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"subsequently."},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's an old history of\nfighting against monopolies"},"690":{"dur":3,"text":"in the US, and sustaining an\ninstitutional environment which"},"693":{"dur":4,"text":"creates these incentives\nand opportunities."},"698":{"dur":3,"text":"So in the book, I'm\npainting a dichotomy here."},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"The world's more complicated."},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"There's lots of\nnuances and gray areas."},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"But just for the\nsake of the argument,"},"706":{"dur":5,"text":"it's helpful to think of two\ndifferent types of societies,"},"712":{"dur":3,"text":"societies where somehow\nthings get organized,"},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"institutions get\norganized in a way"},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"which creates these\nincentives and opportunities."},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"That creates innovation."},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"It creates prosperity."},"722":{"dur":4,"text":"And there's other places\nwhere things work differently."},"727":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe it's Mexico."},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe it's North Korea."},"730":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe it's the\nDemocratic Republic"},"732":{"dur":3,"text":"of the Congo, where I\ndo a lot of research."},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"Part of the story with\nelectricity, of course,"},"737":{"dur":3,"text":"is it's not just the\nprivate sector or innovation"},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"in the private sector,\nbut the public sector"},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"has to be incentivized\nto provide"},"745":{"dur":3,"text":"basic public goods, like roads."},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is what they call\ninterstate number one."},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"This is one of the main highways\nin the Democratic Republic"},"754":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, the government\ndoesn't bother"},"756":{"dur":1,"text":"providing any infrastructure."},"758":{"dur":1,"text":"You can see what this is like."},"759":{"dur":1,"text":"This is the dry season."},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"You have to dig yourself\nout every kilometer or so."},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"If it was the wet season, you\nwouldn't be going anywhere."},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is an even\nmore dramatic failure"},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"in terms of provision of basic\npublic goods and services"},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"than you'd find in North Korea."},"774":{"dur":5,"text":"So we put some labels on these\ndifferent economic systems."},"780":{"dur":4,"text":"We say, what is it that South\nKorea and the United States"},"784":{"dur":2,"text":"has in common with\nother prosperous places?"},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"It has these economic\ninstitutions,"},"789":{"dur":5,"text":"rules that incentivize people,\nand create opportunities."},"794":{"dur":2,"text":"And we call them inclusive."},"797":{"dur":3,"text":"So we say if you think about\nthe economy, what's common"},"800":{"dur":1,"text":"in these places\nis that they have"},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"inclusive economic institutions."},"805":{"dur":2,"text":"So why this word inclusive?"},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"So let me go back\nto the light bulb."},"809":{"dur":3,"text":"So here's Edison's patent\nfor the light bulb."},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"So I have one thing in\ncommon with Thomas Edison."},"816":{"dur":1,"text":"He had very bad hearing."},"817":{"dur":1,"text":"He had very bad hearing as well."},"819":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's probably\nthe only thing"},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"I have in common\nwith Thomas

important\nabout the patents"},"846":{"dur":2,"text":"and giving out\npatents and stuff?"},"848":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, it was about creating\nincentives for innovation."},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"Innovation creates\npositive externalities."},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"So any person thinking\nabout innovating"},"857":{"dur":1,"text":"is never gonna benefit\nfrom all the wealth"},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"that they create because\nof these externalities."},"861":{"dur":4,"text":"So the idea here was, patents\nbring the private return"},"866":{"dur":2,"text":"to innovation closer\nto the social return."},"868":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, what's\nparticularly interesting"},"870":{"dur":3,"text":"about patents is if you study\nwho took out patents in the US,"},"874":{"dur":3,"text":"historically, like who was\nit that took out patents?"},"877":{"dur":3,"text":"And what's interesting about the\nsocial background of patentees"},"881":{"dur":3,"text":"is that they come from all\nover the social spectrum."},"885":{"dur":2,"text":"So I don't know if people\nhave an analysis of who"},"887":{"dur":2,"text":"works for Google, but\neconomic historians"},"890":{"dur":4,"text":"did an analysis of 19th\ncentury patenting in the US."},"894":{"dur":4,"text":"And what they showed was,\nwho took out patents?"},"898":{"dur":3,"text":"Artisans,

just"},"915":{"dur":4,"text":"saying talent,\nideas, creativity,"},"919":{"dur":2,"text":"that's spread out very\nbroadly in society."},"922":{"dur":2,"text":"You don't know where that is."},"924":{"dur":2,"text":"So you need to create a\nsystem which can harness"},"927":{"dur":1,"text":"all of that latent talent."},"929":{"dur":1,"text":"And this was part of the system."},"930":{"dur":1,"text":"And why the word inclusive?"},"932":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, because you need to\ninclude everybody in this."},"936":{"dur":2,"text":"Patenting, it didn't\nmatter who you were."},"939":{"dur":1,"text":"You could take out a patent."},"940":{"dur":3,"text":"You paid a fee, and the\nstate enforced your patent."},"944":{"dur":1,"text":"The government\nenforced your
