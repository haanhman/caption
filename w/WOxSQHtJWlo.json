drugs"},"123":{"dur":3,"text":"that go through discovery\ninto development."},"126":{"dur":2,"text":"Look at the second cylinder there."},"129":{"dur":5,"text":"You can see that from \n200 Alzheimer's

wrong?"},"144":{"dur":2,"text":"It goes wrong\nbecause of external influences:"},"146":{"dur":2,"text":"malnutrition, still a big problem;"},"149":{"dur":3,"text":"parental and other abuse\n- psychological and physical -;"},"153":{"dur":2,"text":"toxins - particularly alcohol."},"155":{"dur":3,"text":"These are images of my own research\nshowing a normal brain at the

can have acquired\nabnormalities like epilepsy"},"184":{"dur":2,"text":"and there are age-related changes\nsuch as dementia."},"190":{"dur":3,"text":"But the real focus of my talk today\nis how the

baby."},"202":{"dur":1,"text":"Some people would argue"},"204":{"dur":4,"text":"that the whole process of education\nis about taking away flexibility"},"208":{"dur":4,"text":"and forcing every one of you\nto think and behave in the same way."},"213":{"dur":2,"text":"It's about getting conformity of process"},"215":{"dur":1,"text":"which of course is useful"},"216":{"dur":3,"text":"if you're trying to speak a language\nthe same way as other people,"},"219":{"dur":1,"text":"but may not be useful"},"221":{"dur":4,"text":"if it limits how you can deal with\nother things such as problems."},"226":{"dur":3,"text":"And also, the constraining of the brain\nin itself can lead to problems;"},"229":{"dur":2,"text":"if there is not enough of it\nin the right place,"},"232":{"dur":3,"text":"you get disorders\nsuch as ADHD and schizophrenia."},"235":{"dur":1,"text":"If you get excessive constraints,"},"237":{"dur":3,"text":"you can end up with disorders\nlike OCD and addiction."},"241":{"dur":4,"text":"And also the resilience\nin the brain can be impaired,"},"245":{"dur":4,"text":"and that will lead to disorders\nsuch as anxiety and depression."},"250":{"dur":5,"text":"The core of my talk really is showing you\nhow we can now understand"},"255":{"dur":4,"text":"the limitations that the brain\nconstrains the mind with"},"259":{"dur":1,"text":"through using drugs."},"261":{"dur":3,"text":"This research really goes back\nto the 1950s"},"264":{"dur":3,"text":"and the personal experience\nof this man, Aldous

of Perception,\""},"276":{"dur":3,"text":"and he used this quote from William Blake"},"280":{"dur":3,"text":"to explain how these drugs\nchanged his mind."},"283":{"dur":3,"text":"He said, \"If the doors\nof perception were cleansed,"},"286":{"dur":3,"text":"everything would appear\nto man as it is, Infinite."},"290":{"dur":1,"text":"For man has closed himself up"},"292":{"dur":4,"text":"till he sees all things through\nnarrow chinks of his cavern.\""},"297":{"dur":3,"text":"And Huxley realized\nthat what psychedelics do"},"300":{"dur":3,"text":"is take away this phenomenon\nthat he inferred"},"304":{"dur":4,"text":"which is that \"the brain is\nan instrument for focusing the mind.\""},"309":{"dur":3,"text":"Modern neuroscience\nhas shown they were right."},"312":{"dur":2,"text":"Because, what we now know"},"314":{"dur":4,"text":"is that the brain creates\nwhat the mind thinks it's doing."},"318":{"dur":1,"text":"Here is an example of vision."},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"You might be looking out\nat a glorious sunset,"},"323":{"dur":4,"text":"but in reality, the light rays\ngo into your retina"},"327":{"dur":3,"text":"and are transformed\ninto a series of electrical impulses"},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"which pass into parts in your brain."},"333":{"dur":3,"text":"And those parts of the brain\nreconstruct an image"},"337":{"dur":2,"text":"that they think you're seeing."},"340":{"dur":2,"text":"And that image, in the words of Blake,"},"343":{"dur":3,"text":"is seeing through the constraints,\nthe chinks of the cavern"},"347":{"dur":1,"text":"that your brain puts on it."},"350":{"dur":4,"text":"And if you have mental illness\n- for instance, depression or addiction -"},"355":{"dur":3,"text":"then what you see is also\nconstrained by your brain."},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"So depressed people don't see\neven the brightness of the sky."},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"They see a dull grey."},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"And of course, people with addiction"},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"when they see through\nthe chinks of their cavern,"},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"they simply see the drugs\nthat they're addicted to."},"375":{"dur":3,"text":"Psychedelic drugs\ntake away that limitation."},"378":{"dur":4,"text":"They allow the mind to work\nin a much more flexible way."},"383":{"dur":3,"text":"This is our research using psilocybin\nin magic mushroom juice."},"386":{"dur":3,"text":"Those two images contain\nthe same number of connections."},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"But on the left-hand image, under placebo,"},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"you see that most of the connections\nare around the edge."},"395":{"dur":4,"text":"The brain talks to itself\nin regional ways."},"400":{"dur":1,"text":"But under psilocybin,"},"401":{"dur":3,"text":"there's a massive cross-talk,\nmuch more integration;"},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"parts of the brain which haven't talk\nto each other since you were children"},"408":{"dur":1,"text":"are able to engage."},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's how people can get new insights"},"411":{"dur":5,"text":"and also, potentially overcome damage\nof dysfunction of the brain."},"417":{"dur":4,"text":"Here is another study using LSD\nshowing essentially the same thing."},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"On the left-hand side,"},"423":{"dur":4,"text":"you see the visual cortex is\nnormally very local in how it works."},"427":{"dur":3,"text":"But under LSD,\nwhen people have their eyes closed,"},"431":{"dur":4,"text":"they can see enormously vivid,\ninteresting sets of images."},"435":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's because the brain is\nmuch more interconnected under LSD"},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"than normal."},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"Here you see that the visual cortex"},"443":{"dur":3,"text":"connects to most of the rest\nof the brain in that state."},"448":{"dur":5,"text":"We've been able to utilize this liberation\nof processing of the brain,"},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"produced by psychedelics,"},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"to treat people with depression."},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"Here is a study published last year"},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"where we took people with depression"},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"who failed two previous\nanti-depressive treatments,"},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"and also had failed psychotherapy."},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"They were given\na single dose of psilocybin,"},"469":{"dur":3,"text":"and you can see there, that a week later,"},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"all of them had recovered to some extend,"},"474":{"dur":3,"text":"and half of them were now\nin a state of remission."},"477":{"dur":1,"text":"They were in the yellow bar there,"},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"which shows that their depression\nhas actually gone away."},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's not the first evidence"},"483":{"dur":3,"text":"that psychedelics have therapy\nor have therapeutic uses."},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"We also have evidence\nfrom around the world"},"490":{"dur":4,"text":"that psilocybin can be useful in helping\npeople deal with alcohol dependence,"},"494":{"dur":3,"text":"with smoking dependence,\nwith obsessive compulsive disorder."},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"And most recently,"},"499":{"dur":3,"text":"two major studies showing\nit can help people come to terms"},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"with the anxiety and the depression"},"505":{"dur":4,"text":"which almost always accompany\na diagnosis of a terminal illness."},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"So, these drugs can have\npotentially enormous opportunities"},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"for helping people deal\nwith mental distress."},"517":{"dur":3,"text":"It's not just psychedelics\nthat can have that potential."},"520":{"dur":3,"text":"Many illegal drugs have medical uses."},"523":{"dur":3,"text":"So for non-psychedelics\nsuch as MDMA, ecstasy,"},"526":{"dur":3,"text":"where there is good evidence\nin post-traumatic stress disorder"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"and also some studies\ngoing on in addiction."},"532":{"dur":1,"text":"And of course, there is cannabis"},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"where we have a range\nof different disorders"},"537":{"dur":3,"text":"from pain, spasticity, cancer, epilepsy,"},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"inflammatory diseases,\nand also sleep disorders."},"543":{"dur":4,"text":"All of these, potentially, are amenable\nto treatment with cannabis."},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"So, why don't we use these drugs?"},"552":{"dur":5,"text":"That's because the WHL and the UN\nhave said they are too dangerous,"},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"which is certainly untrue."},"559":{"dur":1,"text":"I can tell you categorically"},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"none of our patients died\nin the experiments we did on them."},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"Most of our governments\nperpetuate this lie."},"568":{"dur":4,"text":"And many of us - hopefully, not you -\nhave closed minds."},"572":{"dur":4,"text":"We do not want to believe\nthat these might have therapeutic utility."},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"So I want to say to you now,"},"579":{"dur":3,"text":"surely now: you, if not everyone,"},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"should accept the fact"},"585":{"dur":4,"text":"that these drugs potentially\ncould be very important medicines."},"590":{"dur":3,"text":"For the sake of the millions of people\nin the world who could be helped,"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"it's time to say there should be no limits"},"596":{"dur":4,"text":"to the therapeutic research\nwe do with these drugs."},"600":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you."},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"(Applause)"}}
