hosting."},"179":{"dur":1,"text":"It takes about 10 minutes."},"181":{"dur":5,"text":"Then, we will install the website store design\n\u2013 about 5 minutes, and then I will take"},"186":{"dur":6,"text":"you through step-by-step the full eCommerce\nset up that you will need to add products,"},"192":{"dur":5,"text":"accept payments and do everything else that\nother eCommerce sites can do and more."},"197":{"dur":4,"text":"So to give you a little bit more information,\nwe will be getting a domain."},"202":{"dur":5,"text":"You can select your own and you will have\nfull ownership of that domain, and webhosting"},"207":{"dur":3,"text":"\u2013 a server where all of the website files\nare stored."},"210":{"dur":5,"text":"So everything from the text to images

online."},"272":{"dur":5,"text":"Let\u2019s set the base, build a foundation before\nwe can start setting up your store."},"277":{"dur":8,"text":"And the best place to do that is hostgator.com."},"285":{"dur":5,"text":"For acquiring your domain and hosting I would\nlike to introduce to you a company called"},"291":{"dur":1,"text":"HostGator."},"292":{"dur":6,"text":"I have

demonstrate them to you because I will be\ndemonstrating this tutorial using my HostGator"},"327":{"dur":1,"text":"account."},"328":{"dur":4,"text":"So if you want to follow along with me exactly\nin the same steps, I do recommend HostGator."},"333":{"dur":4,"text":"So the first thing you will notice is that\nthere are two different types of hosting \u2013 Web"},"337":{"dur":2,"text":"Hosting and WordPress Hosting."},"339":{"dur":5,"text":"Now although we are building a WordPress site,\nit does not mean that you need WordPress hosting."},"345":{"dur":3,"text":"All you need is basic web hosting."},"348":{"dur":4,"text":"Now WordPress hosting is more expensive, and\nyou can read about that in your own time if"},"353":{"dur":4,"text":"you want to, but personally I just use the\nordinary web hosting and I set up my WordPress"},"357":{"dur":3,"text":"sites using normal web hosting."},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"So click on that."},"363":{"dur":4,"text":"Also the normal web hosting is a lot cheaper\nthan the WordPress hosting, and to be honest"},"367":{"dur":3,"text":"It is more than enough to run your eCommerce\nwebsite."},"371":{"dur":1,"text":"So go down."},"372":{"dur":1,"text":"You will see three different plans."},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"The Business Plan has stuff you don\u2019t need,\nso ignore that."},"376":{"dur":4,"text":"The Baby Plan is very similar to the Hatchling\nin the way that all the features are very"},"381":{"dur":5,"text":"similar except the Baby Plan allows you to\nhost more than one domain, whereas the Hatchling"},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"Plan only allows you to host one single domain."},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"That means one single eCommerce website."},"391":{"dur":4,"text":"Now I assume this is the first eCommerce site\nfor most of you, so I would recommend the"},"395":{"dur":1,"text":"Hatchling Plan, which is also the cheapest."},"397":{"dur":4,"text":"Down the track if you do have other websites,\nyou can always upgrade to the Baby Plan, so"},"402":{"dur":1,"text":"that is not a problem."},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"So just click on the Sign-up button."},"407":{"dur":6,"text":"Next you will need to either register a new\ndomain if you haven\u2019t already got one, or"},"413":{"dur":4,"text":"click this tab here if you already own a domain\nelsewhere, and then enter it in this field"},"418":{"dur":1,"text":"here."},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"Now for most of you, you will need to register\na new domain."},"422":{"dur":11,"text":"So for the purposes of this tutorial, I will\nregister a domain called myecommstore."},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"Now a dot com is my personal preference."},"437":{"dur":5,"text":"You can choose a dot net, org, dot info."},"443":{"dur":4,"text":"It does not make any difference when it comes\nto setting up your WordPress website."},"447":{"dur":4,"text":"It is just a personal preference of mine to\nselect dot com."},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"So I will be doing that."},"453":{"dur":7,"text":"Now make sure that you have selected the domain\nthat you want to register."},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"You can choose a billing cycle."},"463":{"dur":4,"text":"You will notice that the longer you subscribe\nfor upfront, the cheaper it will be."},"467":{"dur":3,"text":"Now it says 20% off here, but I\u2019ll show\nyou in a second how to get a much bigger discount"},"471":{"dur":1,"text":"than this 20% off."},"473":{"dur":4,"text":"So I generally subscribe for 12 months or\ntwo years at a time."},"478":{"dur":1,"text":"So let\u2019s select 24 months."},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"It\u2019s completely up to you."},"482":{"dur":9,"text":"Enter a username, and a security PIN."},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"Now let\u2019s just skip over the billing info\nfor a second."},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"Go to Additional Services."},"496":{"dur":5,"text":"I want you to uncheck or deselect anything\nin this area here because, to be honest, it\u2019s"},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"not absolutely necessary, and I don\u2019t use\nany of these myself."},"505":{"dur":4,"text":"So if any of these are enabled, they are extra\nexpenses, but you don\u2019t need them."},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"So feel free to deselect them."},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"Now going down, the Coupon Code."},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"Like I said, I can get you a better discount\nthan the ordinary 20% off."},"519":{"dur":6,"text":"Have a look at your amount due, and enter\nthis Coupon Code instead - ONLINESTORE."},"525":{"dur":7,"text":"Don\u2019t forget to click validate, and you\nwill notice that the discount is a bigger"},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"discount, and the amount due is lower now."},"536":{"dur":4,"text":"This coupon will always give you a bigger\ndiscount than the standard HostGator coupon,"},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"so please do take advantage of that."},"543":{"dur":4,"text":"Next, go back up and fill in your personal\nbilling details."},"548":{"dur":3,"text":"Of course, I will be blurring my screen here\nbecause I don\u2019t want to disclose any of"},"551":{"dur":32,"text":"my personal billing details."},"584":{"dur":20,"text":"And you have got two options to pay \u2013 credit\ncard or PayPal."},"605":{"dur":4,"text":"When you have done that, scroll down."},"609":{"dur":5,"text":"Just double check that all of your details\nare correct, and then click on this \u201cI have"},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"read and agree to the terms and conditions\u201d\ncheckbox."},"617":{"dur":5,"text":"When you are ready, click Checkout, and you\nwill have secured your domain and hosting"},"622":{"dur":5,"text":"and that is the only expense that you will\nhave throughout this tutorial to set up your"},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"eCommerce website."},"630":{"dur":4,"text":"Just so you know, I may receive small referral\ncredits from HostGator and this helps me bring"},"634":{"dur":3,"text":"these videos to you free of charge because\nit helps me cover my costs."},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"So thanks in advance for supporting me."},"640":{"dur":5,"text":"Click \u201cCheckout\u201d and I will show you the\nnext step to set up your eCommerce website."},"646":{"dur":5,"text":"The next thing you will receive is a confirmation\nin e-mail from HostGator containing details"},"651":{"dur":1,"text":"of your order."},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"It will have your domain, which you now own."},"656":{"dur":5,"text":"You are now the sole owner of this domain\nname, and it will contain details such as"},"662":{"dur":3,"text":"your Control Panel link, Username and Password."},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"And, I will show you what to do with that\nnow."},"668":{"dur":7,"text":"So locate your control panel link, click on\nthat, and in the next step enter in your username"},"675":{"dur":9,"text":"and password."},"684":{"dur":20,"text":"So I will just copy and paste into that section\nthere, and then log in."},"705":{"dur":4,"text":"This area here is known as your Hosting Control\nPanel."},"709":{"dur":4,"text":"So the next thing we need to do is install\nthe WordPress platform."},"714":{"dur":5,"text":"The WordPress platform is what we will use\nto manage the content on our website."},"719":{"dur":6,"text":"So go down, and locate the link called Quick\nInstall."},"726":{"dur":8,"text":"Click on that, then in the left hand side\ncolumn, let\u2019s click on WordPress."},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"Continue."},"736":{"dur":3,"text":"Your domain should automatically populate\nin this box here."},"740":{"dur":3,"text":"If it doesn\u2019t, then just select it from\nthe drop down below."},"743":{"dur":1,"text":"Leave this box empty."},"744":{"dur":7,"text":"I\u2019d like you to disable the Auto Upgrades,\nand in Admin E-mail, enter your own personal"},"752":{"dur":9,"text":"e-mail address that you check regularly."},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"Leave Blog Title empty for now."},"763":{"dur":3,"text":"As Admin user \u2026 for Admin user, just enter\nadmin."},"767":{"dur":4,"text":"You can leave first and last name empty, and\nthen click install now, and this will install"},"772":{"dur":14,"text":"the WordPress platform onto your server."},"787":{"dur":1,"text":"And that is done."},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"WordPress is now installed."},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"There are some important pieces of information\njust over here."},"793":{"dur":1,"text":"Firstly, this URL."},"795":{"dur":9,"text":"You\u2019ll notice it will be yourdomain\/wp-admin,\nand that is the URL you will have to access"},"804":{"dur":4,"text":"to enter the administration area for managing\nyour website."},"808":{"dur":3,"text":"So anytime you want to manage your website,\ngo to that URL there."},"811":{"dur":2,"text":"So open that in a new tab, if you can."},"814":{"dur":6,"text":"Just keep in mind that sometimes this does\ntake around 15 to 20 minutes to activate after"},"821":{"dur":1,"text":"you install WordPress."},"822":{"dur":8,"text":"So if this loads a blank page, just come back\nin about 15 or 20 minutes and try again."},"831":{"dur":4,"text":"Eventually this is the screen you will see."},"836":{"dur":8,"text":"It is the WordPress Administration log in,\nand we can use the password and username provided"},"844":{"dur":5,"text":"here."},"849":{"dur":3,"text":"This password is really long, and we won\u2019t\nbe able to remember that."},"852":{"dur":10,"text":"So the first thing we will do when we log\nin is change that password."},"863":{"dur":7,"text":"Cool."},"870":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is your WordPress Admin Dashboard."},"873":{"dur":5,"text":"This is the back end where you will control\nyour entire eCommerce website."},"878":{"dur":4,"text":"So I will show you during the length of this\ntutorial how to use all the different things"},"883":{"dur":4,"text":"here to set up your online

on Admin."},"901":{"dur":4,"text":"That is the user we just set up when we installed\nWordPress."},"905":{"dur":4,"text":"You can change any details that you want,\nbut what we want to do now is enter a new"},"910":{"dur":1,"text":"password in this field."},"911":{"dur":8,"text":"So enter your new password, and then come\ndown and click Update profile."},"920":{"dur":3,"text":"Cool."},"923":{"dur":13,"text":"So if I just log out now \u2026 to summarize,\nI would like you to write down three important"},"937":{"dur":2,"text":"pieces of information."},"939":{"dur":10,"text":"One is URL \u2013 yourwebsite.com\/wp-admin; your\nusername, which is probably admin if you followed"},"950":{"dur":2,"text":"what I did; and your new password."},"953":{"dur":4,"text":"Write that down somewhere, and keep it handy\nbecause anytime you want to make changes to"},"957":{"dur":5,"text":"your online store, you will have to come down\nto

next thing we need to do is install\nwhat is known as WooCommerce."},"1224":{"dur":4,"text":"WooCommerce is going to be our eCommerce platform."},"1229":{"dur":6,"text":"So we will need this to control everything\nfrom adding products, setting prices managing"},"1235":{"dur":7,"text":"shipping, creating coupons and everything\nelse that an e-commerce website needs to

to the Variations tab."},"2367":{"dur":2,"text":"We want to link all variations."},"2370":{"dur":3,"text":"Now in this example, we only have four different\nvariations."},"2374":{"dur":7,"text":"So what this will do is create four separate\nvariations."},"2381":{"dur":4,"text":"There we go \u2013 Four variations added."},"2385":{"dur":2,"text":"Now here is the interesting part."},"2388":{"dur":4,"text":"You can assign a SKU for each variation."},"2392":{"dur":5,"text":"You can enter a different price for each different\nvariation."},"2397":{"dur":8,"text":"So say black

upload\na different image."},"2429":{"dur":6,"text":"And when a user clicks on that particular\noption, the image that they see will automatically"},"2436":{"dur":18,"text":"change, and I will show you that in a second."},"2454":{"dur":18,"text":"Okay."},"2473":{"dur":10,"text":"Now let\u2019s say as an example, let\u2019s leave\nblack and orange at 55, but let\u2019s give red"},"2483":{"dur":3,"text":"a sale price and teal as well."},"2487":{"dur":3,"text":"Just to see it as an example."},"2490":{"dur":4,"text":"And like I said, you can manage stock for\neach different variation as well."},"2495":{"dur":13,"text":"If you just click on that check box, you will\nsee that you can adjust the stock quantity."},"2508":{"dur":8,"text":"Okay."},"2517":{"dur":5,"text":"Now the next thing you need to do is set a\nfeatured image."},"2523":{"dur":3,"text":"So because we already have these uploaded\nto my media library, we can select one of"},"2527":{"dur":10,"text":"them as a featured image, and then we can\nenter more images."},"2537":{"dur":5,"text":"Just hold down Ctrl, and select as many images\nas you want, and click Add to Gallery."},"2542":{"dur":3,"text":"And, they can be your other product gallery\nimages."},"2545":{"dur":11,"text":"Once you do that, click Publish, and let\u2019s\ntake a look."},"2557":{"dur":4,"text":"So here are our Scatter Cushions."},"2561":{"dur":6,"text":"The price ranges from 45 to 55, and you can\nsee we have an area here for selecting our"},"2568":{"dur":1,"text":"option."},"2570":{"dur":3,"text":"So if I choose black, guess what happens?"},"2573":{"dur":9,"text":"That image changes to black because that is\nthe image that we uploaded for black here."},"2583":{"dur":10,"text":"Similarly, if I choose teal, it changes to\nthat corresponding color."},"2594":{"dur":3,"text":"There you go."},"2598":{"dur":1,"text":"It is really, really cool, isn\u2019t it?"},"2599":{"dur":5,"text":"And, really easy to set up, and there we go."},"2604":{"dur":4,"text":"In the Additional Information, we have a little\nbit of a description."},"2609":{"dur":8,"text":"It comes in four different colors, and for\nyour piece of mind, it also has the stock"},"2617":{"dur":1,"text":"quantity over here."},"2619":{"dur":5,"text":"So if anything is out of stock, it will not\nallow the user to add that particular variation"},"2624":{"dur":2,"text":"to their shopping cart."},"2627":{"dur":5,"text":"And depending on which variation you choose,\nthe price also changes because we made black"},"2632":{"dur":5,"text":"and orange 55, and red and teal 45."},"2637":{"dur":8,"text":"So that is a really easy way to set up products\nthat have different variations to them."},"2646":{"dur":4,"text":"Now I am going to show you one more product\nthat have variables to them, but this time"},"2651":{"dur":1,"text":"they will have two variables."},"2652":{"dur":1,"text":"They will have color."},"2654":{"dur":2,"text":"So take these cubes for example."},"2656":{"dur":5,"text":"They come in black, and they come in white\nand also size."},"2662":{"dur":4,"text":"They come in six cubes, and they come in nine\ncubes."},"2666":{"dur":10,"text":"So let\u2019s use that to set up our different\nvariations \u2013 color and size."},"2676":{"dur":17,"text":"So I will just Add Product, just quickly enter\nsome dummy text in there."},"2694":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay."},"2696":{"dur":11,"text":"Let\u2019s assign a new category for this called\nStorage, and now in this area of course we"},"2708":{"dur":13,"text":"will select a variable product, and in Attributes\nlet\u2019s add a new attribute."},"2722":{"dur":4,"text":"First one will be Color."},"2727":{"dur":9,"text":"Check Used for Variations, and it simply comes\nin two colors \u2013 white or black."},"2736":{"dur":5,"text":"Let\u2019s Save, and add one more."},"2742":{"dur":3,"text":"This one will be Size."},"2745":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay."},"2748":{"dur":13,"text":"So the different values here will be a Six\ncube and a Nine cube."},"2762":{"dur":6,"text":"Okay."},"2769":{"dur":2,"text":"I will Save that."},"2771":{"dur":3,"text":"Just ensure both checkboxes are ticked."},"2775":{"dur":5,"text":"And now in the Variations section, let\u2019s\nclick Link All Variations."},"2780":{"dur":4,"text":"Now we should have a total of four because\nwe have a white in a six cube and nine cube,"},"2785":{"dur":4,"text":"and a black in a six and a nine cube, so that\nequals four variations."},"2789":{"dur":1,"text":"So, yes."},"2791":{"dur":4,"text":"All four have been added, and you can see\nthem here."},"2796":{"dur":1,"text":"There we go."},"2797":{"dur":4,"text":"There is a white six, black six, white nine\nand black nine."},"2802":{"dur":1,"text":"Perfect."},"2803":{"dur":1,"text":"So what we can do now is the same as before."},"2805":{"dur":12,"text":"Let\u2019s start adding the information for each\nparticular variable."},"2817":{"dur":48,"text":"Let\u2019s say the white ones are $95, and the\nblack ones; let\u2019s say that is $95 as well,"},"2866":{"dur":13,"text":"and let\u2019s say the nine cube ones are $145."},"2880":{"dur":11,"text":"Okay."},"2891":{"dur":2,"text":"I will come to all these other settings a\nlittle bit later."},"2894":{"dur":1,"text":"So don\u2019t worry about shipping class."},"2895":{"dur":5,"text":"We will come to that a little later."},"2900":{"dur":3,"text":"Cool."},"2904":{"dur":1,"text":"For now, that is fine."},"2905":{"dur":10,"text":"Next, let\u2019s select a featured image, and\nthen let\u2019s select some additional product"},"2916":{"dur":1,"text":"images."},"2917":{"dur":5,"text":"Actually, I might upload some different images."},"2923":{"dur":18,"text":"I will deselect that one and that one."},"2941":{"dur":2,"text":"Perfect."},"2943":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay."},"2946":{"dur":6,"text":"Let\u2019s publish that."},"2952":{"dur":1,"text":"There we go."},"2953":{"dur":2,"text":"We have our storage cube set up."},"2956":{"dur":3,"text":"They range depending on what option the customer\nchooses."},"2959":{"dur":8,"text":"They can choose their color, and they can\nchoose their size."},"2968":{"dur":5,"text":"So depending on the variation they choose,\nthe associated image will pop up, which is"},"2974":{"dur":2,"text":"absolutely perfect."},"2976":{"dur":8,"text":"And, they can obviously view the image

unsure, just leave shipping tax class based\non cart items."},"6371":{"dur":3,"text":"That is the smartest way of doing things."},"6374":{"dur":4,"text":"Here you can round tax at a subtotal level\ninstead of per line."},"6379":{"dur":2,"text":"That results in a much cleaner checkout."},"6381":{"dur":2,"text":"So I choose to enable that."},"6384":{"dur":5,"text":"In tax classes, there are

once again, there\u2019s no right or wrong\nanswer."},"6425":{"dur":4,"text":"It\u2019s just what you think will work best,\nor maybe you can test each one of these two"},"6430":{"dur":3,"text":"out

well."},"6440":{"dur":4,"text":"Now the price display suffix, this will be\nthe little note after the price."},"6445":{"dur":5,"text":"So for example, price inclusive of

apply."},"6589":{"dur":2,"text":"In my case, it doesn\u2019t apply."},"6592":{"dur":5,"text":"Now shipping, do you want to add tax on top\nof the shipping as well, or do you want to"},"6597":{"dur":1,"text":"tax the shipping?"},"6599":{"dur":1,"text":"No."},"6600":{"dur":4,"text":"I\u2019m pretty sure that the GST is exclusive\nof shipping."},"6604":{"dur":4,"text":"I\u2019ll have to double check that though."},"6608":{"dur":2,"text":"When you\u2019re ready, click save changes."},"6611":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay."},"6613":{"dur":1,"text":"Cool."},"6614":{"dur":5,"text":"Here

information."},"6652":{"dur":3,"text":"Once again, I could only show you how to do\nthings, but I can\u2019t tell you what to do"},"6655":{"dur":2,"text":"because taxes differ in every single

sells."},"6666":{"dur":4,"text":"I will show you how you can do this within\nWooCommerce itself."},"6670":{"dur":2,"text":"As an example, have a look at Amazon."},"6672":{"dur":5,"text":"If I go to this bedframe here, you will see\nthat Amazon has a section here, Customers"},"6677":{"dur":5,"text":"who bought this item also bought, and they\nhave related products."},"6683":{"dur":5,"text":"This is an excellent example of cross selling."},"6688":{"dur":6,"text":"For our example, I will take this bedframe\nover here, and I will use the related products"},"6694":{"dur":5,"text":"we have for the purposes of demonstrating\nhow to upsell and cross sell products within"},"6700":{"dur":2,"text":"your eCommerce website."},"6702":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay."},"6703":{"dur":3,"text":"To start with, what is upselling?"},"6706":{"dur":4,"text":"For those of you who do not know, say for\nexample, a customer has selected a bed frame,"},"6711":{"dur":4,"text":"and you present the customer with the option\nto purchase a full-bed set."},"6716":{"dur":4,"text":"That means that the full-bed set will have\na higher price, it has more products, and"},"6721":{"dur":3,"text":"the key is that it will make you a bigger\nprofit."},"6725":{"dur":1,"text":"So when should you upsell?"},"6726":{"dur":5,"text":"The key here is to only suggest upsells when\nthey will make you more money."},"6731":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay."},"6732":{"dur":5,"text":"Now let me show you how to setup upselling\nwithin WooCommerce."},"6738":{"dur":6,"text":"So say the base product is this queen bed\nframe."},"6744":{"dur":9,"text":"So if I just navigate to that product inside\nmy WooCommerce Dashboard, here it is, the"},"6753":{"dur":2,"text":"queen bed frame."},"6755":{"dur":6,"text":"So let\u2019s say when somebody adds this queen\nbed frame to cart, I want them to be presented"},"6762":{"dur":7,"text":"with the option of buying this full bed set,\nwhich includes absolutely everything \u2013 a"},"6770":{"dur":2,"text":"mattress, bedside tables, etcetera, etcetera."},"6772":{"dur":7,"text":"It costs $2,500, whereas if they purchase\nour bed frame alone, it only costs $550."},"6780":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay."},"6781":{"dur":6,"text":"So to setup your upsell, go to the product\nthat you want to setup the upsell for, then"},"6788":{"dur":1,"text":"go to Linked Products."},"6790":{"dur":5,"text":"Now in this upsells area, just start entering\nthe details or the name or the product that"},"6795":{"dur":5,"text":"you want to upsell."},"6800":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, select the product from the list."},"6802":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is the one that I want to upsell to,\nthe full-bed set."},"6807":{"dur":4,"text":"And then, I can click on the Update button."},"6811":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay."},"6813":{"dur":2,"text":"Now I\u2019ll show you how that works."},"6816":{"dur":3,"text":"Say somebody comes across this bed frame."},"6819":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay."},"6820":{"dur":1,"text":"Cool."},"6821":{"dur":2,"text":"I\u2019m interested, then I read a little bit\nabout it."},"6824":{"dur":5,"text":"Okay, and then they\u2019ll see this section\nhere, you may also like."},"6829":{"dur":1,"text":"Then, they may think, \u201cHang on."},"6831":{"dur":2,"text":"I may as well purchase this full-bed set."},"6833":{"dur":2,"text":"Let me have a look at it.\u201d"},"6836":{"dur":4,"text":"They can click on that, read up on some details,\nand if they are tempted, they will end up"},"6841":{"dur":5,"text":"adding this to cart rather than just the bed\nframe."},"6846":{"dur":3,"text":"So say for example, they add that to cart,\nand there you go."},"6849":{"dur":7,"text":"You\u2019ve effectively upsold them onto a bigger\nproduct that makes you more money."},"6856":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay."},"6857":{"dur":2,"text":"So that\u2019s how upselling works."},"6860":{"dur":5,"text":"Now cross selling, the subtle difference here,\nso say for example, say a customer selects"},"6865":{"dur":5,"text":"the bed frame, under checkout, you offer the\ncustomer to also purchase a mattress and a"},"6871":{"dur":4,"text":"headboard because they both go well with the\nbed frame that the customer has already added"},"6875":{"dur":1,"text":"to cart."},"6877":{"dur":5,"text":"Like I showed you before, Amazon has a gray\narea called, customers who bought this item"},"6882":{"dur":1,"text":"also bought."},"6884":{"dur":1,"text":"Now when should you implement this?"},"6886":{"dur":5,"text":"The key here is that you should offer to cross\nsell products that complement each other."},"6891":{"dur":2,"text":"Now that\u2019s very, very important."},"6893":{"dur":1,"text":"Why should you do that?"},"6895":{"dur":3,"text":"Because you\u2019ll get people purchasing things\nthey didn\u2019t originally come to the website"},"6899":{"dur":1,"text":"for."},"6900":{"dur":5,"text":"Therefore, you sell more products per visitor,\nand that means you\u2019ll make more revenue."},"6905":{"dur":3,"text":"So let me show you how to cross sell products\nin WooCommerce."},"6909":{"dur":4,"text":"So if I take the same example, the queen bed\nframe, so anyone who lands on the queen bed"},"6914":{"dur":5,"text":"frame page, I want them to be presented with\na cross sell."},"6920":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay."},"6921":{"dur":6,"text":"So same area as before - linked Products,\ncross sells, start entering the

to my store, let\u2019s just go\nto the bedding area again."},"6955":{"dur":1,"text":"So say I\u2019m a new visitor."},"6957":{"dur":2,"text":"I\u2019ve landed on this page here, the queen\nbed

add that to cart."},"6974":{"dur":4,"text":"Eventually, they will view their shopping\ncart."},"6979":{"dur":12,"text":"Now when they land on this page, they will\nsee Presented Options, you may also be interested"},"6991":{"dur":1,"text":"in."},"6992":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay."},"6993":{"dur":5,"text":"So I\u2019ve added this queen bed frame to cart,\nand now it\u2019s giving me an offer to add

may add that to cart as well."},"7027":{"dur":1,"text":"So what\u2019s happened here?"},"7028":{"dur":5,"text":"Essentially, the customer has ended up purchasing\nthings that they didn\u2019t originally intend"},"7034":{"dur":2,"text":"on purchasing when they came to your website."},"7037":{"dur":1,"text":"Now why do you think Amazon does this?"},"7038":{"dur":1,"text":"Why do you think

up\npurchasing."},"7056":{"dur":2,"text":"So I do urge you."},"7058":{"dur":7,"text":"Go in and setup your upselling and cross selling\nfor anyone of your products that you see

thing you need to do is enable\nfree shipping."},"7864":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay."},"7865":{"dur":3,"text":"Now there\u2019s a number of different ways you\ncan do this."},"7869":{"dur":5,"text":"You can have, for example, free shipping for\ncustomers who spend more than $50 on your"},"7874":{"dur":3,"text":"store, and they do not require a coupon to\ndo that."},"7877":{"dur":1,"text":"It\u2019s just

than $50."},"7905":{"dur":2,"text":"It has nothing to do with coupons."},"7907":{"dur":8,"text":"However, you can also configure it at such\nthat people can get free shipping with a coupon,"},"7915":{"dur":5,"text":"or you can have a minimum amount or a coupon,\nor a minimum amount and a coupon."},"7921":{"dur":7,"text":"So say, this scenario will be great for people\nwho have a free shipping coupon regardless"},"7929":{"dur":2,"text":"of their spend."},"7931":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay."},"7932":{"dur":5,"text":"This scenario will be great for people who\nneed a minimum order

shipping."},"7945":{"dur":3,"text":"So that\u2019s what I will setup, enter a minimum\norder and a coupon."},"7948":{"dur":3,"text":"So I\u2019ll save that."},"7952":{"dur":7,"text":"Now the coupon code, I\u2019ll call it, 50FREESHIP."},"7959":{"dur":7,"text":"Of course, the same as before, you can actually\nrestrict the usage if you need to."},"7967":{"dur":4,"text":"Now in this case, we do not need to set a\nminimum or maximum."},"7971":{"dur":6,"text":"All we need to do is setup that coupon, check\nthis box, and the free shipping method will"},"7977":{"dur":5,"text":"be enabled because we set that up in the other\ntab right here."},"7983":{"dur":7,"text":"So now, I\u2019ll save all of that, and publish."},"7990":{"dur":3,"text":"Now I will go to my store, and choose a product."},"7994":{"dur":14,"text":"Let\u2019s say this one here."},"8009":{"dur":11,"text":"Okay."},"8020":{"dur":5,"text":"So now our shipping is flat rate 10 or
