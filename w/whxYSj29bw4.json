session,"},"965":{"dur":2,"text":"first with something\nthat I know,"},"968":{"dur":2,"text":"whether it's a song that\nI like or a song of mine,"},"970":{"dur":2,"text":"or something that I know\nto kind of just warm up."},"972":{"dur":4,"text":"And then I usually\nstart improvising either"},"977":{"dur":3,"text":"with just my voice,\nor on an instrument--"},"980":{"dur":4,"text":"a instrument like a\nkeyboard or on the bass."},"984":{"dur":1,"text":"In this case, I wrote\na lot of the album"},"986":{"dur":2,"text":"on bass, which I don't\nknow how to play."},"988":{"dur":1,"text":"Really, I just I bought--"},"990":{"dur":2,"text":"I went and I bought a bass,\nbecause I was demoing the song,"},"993":{"dur":1,"text":"and I needed a bass\nplayer to play the lines."},"995":{"dur":1,"text":"And nobody would show up\nthat day, so I was like,"},"997":{"dur":1,"text":"well I guess I'm just\ngoing to buy one."},"998":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll return

keep the bass."},"1008":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I ended up writing a\nlot of this record on that,"},"1011":{"dur":2,"text":"but usually it's\njust improvising."},"1013":{"dur":4,"text":"And I try to just let\nmyself go for a little bit,"},"1018":{"dur":3,"text":"and then I start\nto hear some bit,"},"1021":{"dur":3,"text":"whether it's a rhythm that\nI'm playing or I'm singing,"},"1024":{"dur":2,"text":"or it's a melody\nthat's happening."},"1027":{"dur":4,"text":"And I isolate a small bit of\nthat, and then I repeat it."},"1032":{"dur":4,"text":"So I repeat it to find out more\nabout it, through repetition."},"1036":{"dur":3,"text":"And usually when I find\nout something about it,"},"1039":{"dur":2,"text":"then something else\nhappens that changes,"},"1042":{"dur":3,"text":"and that's usually how\nan idea starts for me."},"1045":{"dur":1,"text":"VIVIEN LEWIT: So it\nbuilds organically."},"1047":{"dur":1,"text":"XENIA RUBINOS: Yeah, through--"},"1048":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah, through improvisation\nand listening."},"1050":{"dur":1,"text":"VIVIEN LEWIT: Do\nyou think the fact--"},"1052":{"dur":3,"text":"because the first record was\nvery synth and organ sounding,"},"1056":{"dur":4,"text":"and the \"Black Terry Cat\" is--"},"1060":{"dur":3,"text":"there's something smoother\nor more jazzy, more melodic"},"1064":{"dur":2,"text":"Do you think any of that\nhad to do with the bass,"},"1067":{"dur":1,"text":"with you just\npulling out that bass"},"1068":{"dur":1,"text":"and beginning to write\nthe record with it?"},"1070":{"dur":1,"text":"XENIA RUBINOS: Definitely."},"1072":{"dur":2,"text":"Writing a lot of songs\non bass, you know,"},"1075":{"dur":2,"text":"influenced-- the sound of the\nalbum is very bass centric."},"1077":{"dur":2,"text":"A lot of the melodies came from\nplaying on that instrument."},"1080":{"dur":1,"text":"VIVIEN LEWIT: It's\nreally rhythmic."},"1082":{"dur":2,"text":"XENIA RUBINOS: Mhm."},"1084":{"dur":4,"text":"The first record was kind of a\npiano trio, power trio record."},"1088":{"dur":4,"text":"So it was very minimal with\nbass drums and keyboards mostly,"},"1093":{"dur":3,"text":"there's not much else\nin the sound palette."},"1096":{"dur":2,"text":"And in this record, I\nexpand that a little bit."},"1099":{"dur":3,"text":"And I did more vocal\nstacks, like in my--"},"1102":{"dur":1,"text":"in the vocal arrangements,\nI have these kind"},"1104":{"dur":1,"text":"of fat vocal stacks\nof layering that I"},"1106":{"dur":1,"text":"haven't done as much before."},"1108":{"dur":2,"text":"I used to loop my\nvoice and use my voice"},"1110":{"dur":1,"text":"as kind of like horns\nand different textures."},"1112":{"dur":2,"text":"Which I'm still doing on\nthis record, but I expanded"},"1114":{"dur":1,"text":"the sound palette\na little bit more,"},"1116":{"dur":2,"text":"with more synth, some guitar."},"1118":{"dur":3,"text":"But I think ultimately\nwhat changed on this album"},"1121":{"dur":3,"text":"for me was also the music I\nwas listening to at the time."},"1125":{"dur":1,"text":"So I was really into--"},"1127":{"dur":2,"text":"I was discovering a\nlot of hip hop music"},"1129":{"dur":4,"text":"that I didn't know about,\nsome groups like Slum
