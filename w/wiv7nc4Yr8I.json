Vinny's,"},"304":{"dur":1,"text":"three and a half years of Vinny's career"},"305":{"dur":1,"text":"and he had not done well."},"307":{"dur":3,"text":"And he kept saying, \"Yes, I do want to be a doctor.\""},"310":{"dur":1,"text":"And so forth."},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"They finally left and I said,"},"314":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Vinny, let's go up and have a cup of coffee.\""},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"So we walked up the street to a coffee shop"},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"and I said, \"Vinny, what do you want to be?\""},"321":{"dur":0,"text":"A doctor."},"322":{"dur":1,"text":"And I said, \"No, you don't."},"324":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Tell me what you want to be.\""},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"He said, \"You really want to know?\""},"327":{"dur":1,"text":"I said, \"Yeah, I really do want to know.\""},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"He said, \"I've been wild about wolves"},"331":{"dur":1,"text":"\"ever since I read Little Red Riding Hood.\""},"333":{"dur":1,"text":"Or whatever it was."},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"And he'd been subscribing to the Journal of Wolfology"},"337":{"dur":3,"text":"or whatever it was and he was nutty

for one more research assistant?\""},"353":{"dur":2,"text":"So Vinny went up there that summer"},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"and the rest of the story is he became,"},"358":{"dur":4,"text":"he got a PhD in wildlife behavior and wildlife management."},"363":{"dur":3,"text":"And the point of the story is that Vinny,"},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"Vinny was trying to do what his parents,"},"368":{"dur":3,"text":"what he thought his parents wanted him to do."},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"They didn't have the good judgment to back off Vinny."},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"It's his life, let him find his own level."},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"So find a calling."},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"Which means you may want to go sit on top of a mountain."},"382":{"dur":1,"text":"We don't have mountains in Ohio,"},"383":{"dur":1,"text":"but you've got them here."},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"Go find a good mountain to sit on and think about it."},"387":{"dur":1,"text":"What makes you tick?"},"388":{"dur":1,"text":"What's really important to you?"},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's not for others to say what is important to you."},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"We can offer some advice here

to talk with his guidance counselor."},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"And walks in and says, \"Moses, have a seat."},"408":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Can I call you Mo?"},"411":{"dur":3,"text":"\"And Moses, I've read

blanks."},"453":{"dur":4,"text":"There is no way you could have counseled that person"},"457":{"dur":1,"text":"in a way that was effective."},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"So anything, any advice you get from career planners"},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"is gonna be probably misleading."},"464":{"dur":0,"text":"Get a life."},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"Stay open to possibilities."},"467":{"dur":1,"text":"Decide what's important to you."},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, we're here to talk about environment."},"470":{"dur":3,"text":"Why should environment be on your career list"},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"and what would that be if it were?"},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"If you were to choose that."},"480":{"dur":3,"text":"Martin Rees, the Astronomer Royal in Britain,"},"484":{"dur":1,"text":"gave us a book

us."},"505":{"dur":1,"text":"That's just hard science."},"506":{"dur":0,"text":"It's not politics."},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not left, it's not right."},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"The big numbers are running against us."},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"Let me offer four of these."},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"One is simply population growth."},"515":{"dur":4,"text":"I've lived to, I'm almost to the third

normal life span,"},"528":{"dur":3,"text":"of nine or maybe 10 or possibly even 11 billion people."},"532":{"dur":1,"text":"The earth is gonna be really crowded."},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"And that

in the atmosphere,"},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"CO2 levels in the atmosphere are now consistently"},"548":{"dur":3,"text":"at 400 parts per million around the world."},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's nobody in the room here"},"553":{"dur":1,"text":"that can give us good reason"},"554":{"dur":1,"text":"why we would stop short at 450 or so."},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"But the inertia momentum of the fossil fuel economy"},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"is gonna carry us through probably 450"},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"and possibly go a bit beyond."},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"And then begin to think through what that means."},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"That doesn't mean just global warming."},"568":{"dur":1,"text":"That's planetary destabilization."},"570":{"dur":1,"text":"Everything that we think we know"},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"about how the world works physically"},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"and also how humans live in that world"},"576":{"dur":1,"text":"is gonna change dramatically."},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"And so at 400 parts per million,"},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"with a roughly 30 year lag,"},"582":{"dur":3,"text":"the anomalies that we are now seeing are the result,"},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"not of 400 parts per million,"},"587":{"dur":4,"text":"but something rather more like 365 or 370 parts per million."},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"The oceans are the big thermal anchor on the planet."},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"So we don't know yet what 400 parts per million is gonna do,"},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"but we know we're not gonna like it."},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"At 450, we're gonna like a whole lot less."},"603":{"dur":1,"text":"Here's a third number."},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"By most estimates, in your lifetime,"},"606":{"dur":4,"text":"we'll lose 25 to 50% of the species on the earth."},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"Will be gone."},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're coming through what Elizabeth

report,"},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"there's a number that just leaps off the page."},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"80 people have more net wealth"},"649":{"dur":3,"text":"than the bottom 3.5 billion people on

wealth"},"657":{"dur":3,"text":"than the bottom 3.5 or 3.6 billion people."},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"That's a world that is designed for trouble."},"665":{"dur":1,"text":"People are not gonna accept that."},"667":{"dur":1,"text":"So you've got four numbers."},"669":{"dur":1,"text":"Everything that you do,"},"671":{"dur":1,"text":"and it doesn't matter what your career

be the issue in one way or another"},"707":{"dur":1,"text":"that you have to contend with."},"708":{"dur":4,"text":"Whether it's crowded freeways or it's changing climate"},"713":{"dur":3,"text":"or it's food issues or it's legal issues,"},"716":{"dur":1,"text":"you have to contend with it."},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"And so whatever your chosen career line is,"},"720":{"dur":2,"text":"across the whole range of futures you could have,"},"723":{"dur":3,"text":"you'll face environmental issues in form or another"},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"and probably, you'll face a good

a challenge."},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"And it is possible to be too late."},"791":{"dur":2,"text":"And the civilization that in years in the past,"},"794":{"dur":3,"text":"I worked for Jimmy Carter's
