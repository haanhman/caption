to get them to understand that it's\nokay that you don't know."},"287":{"dur":3,"text":"Because I think that there is this pressure\nthat amounted with so much information

too."},"309":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah."},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, for me you can if you force it."},"312":{"dur":6,"text":"So, that's where for me entrepreneurialism\nis right at the startup is forcing that square"},"319":{"dur":1,"text":"into the round hole."},"320":{"dur":5,"text":"So and my favorite 4 letter word has always\nbeen 'Next'."},"325":{"dur":3,"text":"So, if things aren't working I'm quickly moving\non to the next thing."},"329":{"dur":3,"text":"So, it just took up and I sold them to my\nfriends because I didn't know anything else"},"333":{"dur":5,"text":"to do and sold to friends of friends and after\na while I rounded up people that liked me."},"338":{"dur":5,"text":"So, I then went into some stores and they\ndidn't want it because they've never

way around that was to get my friends\nto ring up the same shop week after week to"},"355":{"dur":5,"text":"ask for my brand and after a while, I went\nin and the guy said, everyone is asking

no"},"405":{"dur":1,"text":"clue what that was at the time."},"407":{"dur":4,"text":"But because I had a huge market share at that\nstage, it was over two and a half thousand"},"411":{"dur":4,"text":"stores here in this country, let alone all\naround the world there was more."},"416":{"dur":4,"text":"They were stalking my brand so they wanted\nto tap into that add

out that I\nreally did like the licensing thing because"},"430":{"dur":5,"text":"I got paid a royalty for every sale and then\nI licensed it to brands around the world to"},"435":{"dur":6,"text":"over 180 companies with over 900 products\nunderneath those 180 companies and I've got"},"441":{"dur":6,"text":"between 2 and 22 and a half percent of turnover\nall because a stupid woman told me how I had"},"448":{"dur":1,"text":"an attitude problem."},"450":{"dur":3,"text":"Did I expect to be here?"},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"Not at all."},"454":{"dur":7,"text":"I'm a little bit different to how some

day goal and that is\nto do better than I did yesterday because"},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"for me that's manageable."},"475":{"dur":3,"text":"I have clients that sit in front of me and\nI will say, \"What do you want to get out of"},"478":{"dur":1,"text":"your business?\""},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"They go, \"I want a Ferrari.\""},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"And I go, \"That's the stupidest thing I've\never heard of."},"483":{"dur":4,"text":"How about you just pay and then we might go\nto the next level after that.\""},"487":{"dur":1,"text":"So, I didn't expect to be here."},"489":{"dur":6,"text":"I'm extremely blessed that I am but I don't\ntake it for granted either and the other thing"},"495":{"dur":6,"text":"for me is right back early on because I retired\nwhen I was 32."},"502":{"dur":4,"text":"When I sold the brand but I decided I was\ngoing to stop doing business because I love"},"506":{"dur":5,"text":"it and as you know and you do as well, I speak\nin front of a lot business audiences all the"},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"time."},"512":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I got to make sure my content is current\nbut I love it, I love business."},"517":{"dur":4,"text":"You know, the cool thing about you Justin,\njust so you know and I think you said some"},"522":{"dur":5,"text":"really important thing in there and probably\nthe biggest one is that (1) You didn't intend"},"527":{"dur":4,"text":"to do it, you started moving and there is\nsomething that I talk about called The Corridor"},"532":{"dur":4,"text":"Principle that the doors of opportunity are\noutside in the corridor and if we sit in our"},"537":{"dur":1,"text":"hole, we're never going to see that."},"539":{"dur":5,"text":"And the licensing deal was something that\nyou didn't even know existed but because you"},"545":{"dur":6,"text":"went out there, took action and got out in\nthe corridor, things started to present themselves"},"551":{"dur":4,"text":"that you wouldn't have otherwise had the opportunity\nto do."},"555":{"dur":6,"text":"Exactly right and the issue with nice people\nis well, they never actually succeed and this"},"562":{"dur":4,"text":"is not because of lack of skill because really\nthe only thing I passed in school was lunch"},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"time."},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"So, I wasn't the smartest."},"569":{"dur":5,"text":"But it's more about and when I talk, I actually,\nwhen I finish doing my whole story, point"},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"I make out of everything."},"575":{"dur":5,"text":"So, the last 20 years in my life is the reason\nthat most people would never succeed because"},"581":{"dur":4,"text":"they wouldn't even go to that meeting in the\nfirst place because they don't know what it's"},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"about."},"586":{"dur":4,"text":"And the one thing that I know for an absolute\nfact and I don't care how long people who"},"590":{"dur":5,"text":"are listing in many business, this is a 100%\nfact and that is what you currently know is"},"595":{"dur":7,"text":"not what is needed to get to where you want\nto go to and I can prove that based upon the"},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"fact that if it was, you should already be\nthere then by now."},"606":{"dur":4,"text":"So, there is more stuff that they need to\nlearn and I personally believe there is more"},"610":{"dur":3,"text":"stuff we need to unlearn to get ourselves\nto the next level."},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"Totally agree."},"615":{"dur":8,"text":"So, Justin and I kind of met indirectly because\nI happen to be out speaking to entrepreneurs"},"623":{"dur":4,"text":"in Australia and I don't remember who the\nperson was, but someone was in the audience"},"628":{"dur":5,"text":"and I was telling Justin's story because I\nwanted to tell a story about an entrepreneur;"},"633":{"dur":5,"text":"dynamic entrepreneur and I just found Justin's\nstory online and as I'm telling the story,"},"638":{"dur":5,"text":"I guess they texted him and then, they came\nup to me afterwards and said, \"I'm a friend"},"644":{"dur":4,"text":"of Justin's and here is his contact information.\""},"648":{"dur":3,"text":"And we've been in contact supporting each\nother's journey ever since."},"652":{"dur":6,"text":"So, it's really kind of cool that to realize\nthat behind every entrepreneurial journey"},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"is just a real person."},"661":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah and it's about not changing too."},"663":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm the same person I was before."},"666":{"dur":1,"text":"I've got the same friends."},"667":{"dur":6,"text":"Nothing has changed about me and that's probably\nin the realm that I spend a lot of my time"},"674":{"dur":4,"text":"out which is corporate speaking and mentoring."},"679":{"dur":1,"text":"The no."},"680":{"dur":5,"text":"1 comment when I finish, people just come\nup and go, \"You know, you're just normal.\""},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"And I tell them, \"I'm supposed to be normal.\""},"686":{"dur":5,"text":"And I don't want that success from a financial\nperspective to shape or change who I am."},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"My net worth has nothing to do with my self-worth;\nnever has."},"695":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I need to ensure that I stay grounded."},"699":{"dur":3,"text":"Hence why, I'm just a guy that did okay with\na few T-shirts."},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"It's the way that I view it from myself."},"705":{"dur":5,"text":"And if I can assist other people to get to\nthe next level in anything--whether it's in"},"710":{"dur":6,"text":"my information, my mentorship or in products\nthat we've released to the world then that's"},"717":{"dur":4,"text":"my role and I'm blessed to have a crack as\nwe say that here in Australia."},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"Dynamite, dynamite."},"722":{"dur":6,"text":"So, this kind of leads me to this next question\nwhich I; if we had a chance to talk to some"},"729":{"dur":4,"text":"of your closest friends or customers, what\nyou stood for, what would they say to us,"},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"what would they tell us about Justin Herald?"},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"Look, it's funny."},"739":{"dur":8,"text":"As you know, I only got married last week\nand when people are doing their opinion of"},"747":{"dur":5,"text":"Justin or opinion of Renee at the wedding\nthe most common thing which is really hard"},"753":{"dur":4,"text":"to sit there and listen to people talk about\nyou but especially with my friends you never"},"758":{"dur":1,"text":"know what's going to come up."},"759":{"dur":1,"text":"Yup."},"760":{"dur":3,"text":"The most common thing is that I'm always hard\nunder my sleeve."},"763":{"dur":1,"text":"I always have."},"764":{"dur":1,"text":"I will go for the underdog."},"766":{"dur":7,"text":"I'm always battling there for the underdog\nand I think, I don't know."},"774":{"dur":6,"text":"They'd probably tell you I just kept it real."},"780":{"dur":1,"text":"Sitting in a tree doesn't make you a tree."},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"Making money doesn't make you a success."},"785":{"dur":4,"text":"That's just a by-product of doing it all."},"789":{"dur":1,"text":"So, for me, I've been given a great opportunity."},"791":{"dur":4,"text":"I've grabbed them with both hands and sometimes\nother people's hands at the same time to make"},"796":{"dur":4,"text":"sure it doesn't go away and I'm just continually\ndoing that all the time."},"800":{"dur":1,"text":"So, I don't know."},"801":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't really think about it in a great deal."},"803":{"dur":5,"text":"What I've got integrity and ethics are probably\nat the very top of my tree when it comes to"},"809":{"dur":3,"text":"the character traits that I will always advice\nby."},"812":{"dur":6,"text":"The way I was brought up which I'm glad I\nwas brought up that way and the win-win situation."},"819":{"dur":4,"text":"Someone's got to win before I win that's just\nthe way that I've been really."},"823":{"dur":4,"text":"So, that's why I find business very easy and\nvery hard to do."},"827":{"dur":3,"text":"Easy because I'm going to make sure everyone\nwins."},"830":{"dur":7,"text":"Hard because I find it that people seem to\nbe; they find it easy to be dodgy than to"},"838":{"dur":1,"text":"be ethical."},"839":{"dur":1,"text":"So, these guys."},"840":{"dur":5,"text":"And the one thing in our short time knowing\neach other, I can absolutely attest to is"},"845":{"dur":5,"text":"you are what you seem you are on the surface,\nyou are true to you word and you're pretty"},"851":{"dur":3,"text":"well transparent and direct."},"854":{"dur":9,"text":"It's no BS and here is the way it is and here\nis what we need to do and it's a refreshing"},"864":{"dur":1,"text":"change from some of the stuff."},"865":{"dur":5,"text":"Especially, look we're going through crazy,\ncrazy politicians these days here in the states"},"871":{"dur":6,"text":"and it is certainly refreshing to have complete\ntransparency and know where you stand."},"877":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, you got to be."},"879":{"dur":1,"text":"That's not anything I have to do."},"880":{"dur":4,"text":"I don't have to wake up and think of how am\nI going to be today."},"884":{"dur":2,"text":"It's by default that that's all worked out."},"887":{"dur":4,"text":"At the start, even speaking, best example:\nWhen I first was asked, a lot of people want"},"892":{"dur":5,"text":"to become a speaker and [I never that was;]\npeople just asked me because I had a lot of"},"898":{"dur":3,"text":"media attention over here, \"Could you come\nand talk at our conference and stuff.\""},"901":{"dur":5,"text":"Really, no idea what to say because for me\nit was no big deal that the business went."},"907":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, I had to make sure that I had more than\na dollar twenty five in the bank."},"912":{"dur":6,"text":"So then, when I started speaking at conferences\nand then, I looked at how other people were"},"918":{"dur":4,"text":"presenting, what their content was, I was\nsitting there and going, \"You're kidding me.\""},"923":{"dur":3,"text":"Like, there is nothing out there and when\nI finish, people come and go, \"Thank you so"},"926":{"dur":1,"text":"much for being so refreshing."},"928":{"dur":2,"text":"I found that difficult because I wasn't being\nrefreshing."},"931":{"dur":4,"text":"I just was being myself and then, over a period\nof years, I figured out that actually being"},"935":{"dur":5,"text":"me was what people needed to see because I\nwant them to be like that in their business."},"940":{"dur":1,"text":"Don't change who you are."},"942":{"dur":3,"text":"See, personality will outweigh product every\nday."},"946":{"dur":6,"text":"Most employees are forgetting their personality\nand leaving it home because they've been drummed"},"952":{"dur":6,"text":"in their head that they got to be product-driven\nor process-driven and it's not the case."},"958":{"dur":2,"text":"The consumer these days, you got me on my\nbandwagon now."},"961":{"dur":5,"text":"But the consumer these days has got one thing\nmore than ever before and that is choice."},"967":{"dur":3,"text":"So, the product, there is a million of those\nproducts everywhere."},"970":{"dur":1,"text":"So, what's the difference?"},"972":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, the difference for me is me."},"975":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't have to make it up."},"977":{"dur":1,"text":"I can just get out of bed and be me."},"979":{"dur":5,"text":"So, that's why I find it very refreshing to\nbe me instead of, hey now I'm accepted for"},"985":{"dur":1,"text":"who I am with."},"986":{"dur":3,"text":"Realistically, when I was younger I used to\nget in trouble for who I was."},"990":{"dur":1,"text":"So, it's pretty cool."},"991":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah, absolutely."},"992":{"dur":6,"text":"I think that's what society needs to see business\nor otherwise."},"998":{"dur":5,"text":"It just needs to be real and I love that theme."},"1004":{"dur":5,"text":"If you looked at it and I think that if you\nlooked at it--the habits that you have, which"},"1009":{"dur":7,"text":"ones, what couple of habits do you think contributed\nmost to your success that people can kind"},"1016":{"dur":1,"text":"of take away?"},"1018":{"dur":4,"text":"I think, like I said, before my four letter\nword, NEXT."},"1023":{"dur":7,"text":"I'm a, and this goes against what a lot of\npeople have learned (I guess) or have heard"},"1030":{"dur":3,"text":"in the motivational aspect of stuff."},"1034":{"dur":6,"text":"I'm a very good strategic quitter and I think\na lot of people need to learn that skill because"},"1040":{"dur":2,"text":"not everything is going to work."},"1042":{"dur":2,"text":"(Right) People hang on to it for too long."},"1045":{"dur":4,"text":"Then they get themselves all upset because\nit didn't work when they, well it wasn't going"},"1050":{"dur":1,"text":"to work in the first place."},"1051":{"dur":4,"text":"So, if only you just walked away quicker,\nyou wouldn't be emotionally attached to the"},"1055":{"dur":3,"text":"non-outcome because it was never going to\nbe an outcome."},"1058":{"dur":4,"text":"So, when I start seeing things \u2013 either\nslowing down or not going the way that I needed"},"1063":{"dur":4,"text":"to go, not the way that it needs going because\nsometimes there is a natural progression but"},"1068":{"dur":4,"text":"sometimes that natural progression is not\nwhere

in businesses and they\nall fit into each other in a direct or indirect"},"1082":{"dur":1,"text":"way."},"1083":{"dur":5,"text":"So, if I then start something new and it's\nnot fitting into anything else that I'm doing"},"1088":{"dur":3,"text":"well that requires a lot more work than if\nit had fit in."},"1091":{"dur":1,"text":"So, that makes it an easy decision."},"1093":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I'm out pretty quickly."},"1096":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think the other thing is stickability\ntoo."},"1100":{"dur":2,"text":"Not everything is going to be easy either."},"1102":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I get
