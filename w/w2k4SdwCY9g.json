thousands of people died."},"227":{"dur":1,"text":"But it wasn't just deadly."},"228":{"dur":4,"text":"These epidemics are very\ndisruptive, as well."},"232":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is sort of a

how\nthey're transmitted, how"},"241":{"dur":2,"text":"they're spread between people."},"244":{"dur":3,"text":"And they often start\nto blame each other."},"247":{"dur":4,"text":"So in the 1830s, the

getting\nblamed for the cholera."},"260":{"dur":2,"text":"And this wasn't just\nsocial exclusion."},"262":{"dur":4,"text":"This was actually violent--\nviolent assaults as

Irish\nimmigrants were working"},"283":{"dur":3,"text":"on a stretch of railway track."},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"And there had been\na cholera outbreak."},"289":{"dur":2,"text":"And the local

burnt down."},"319":{"dur":1,"text":"So the question I\nwanted to ask is,"},"321":{"dur":3,"text":"how does a microbe cause all\nof this death and destruction?"},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"When you think about\na microbe, it's"},"327":{"dur":1,"text":"this little, tiny,\nmicroscopic thing"},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"with no independent\nlocomotion at all."},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"And yet it can cause\nall of this devastation,"},"335":{"dur":4,"text":"and impact human history\nin such a profound way."},"339":{"dur":2,"text":"And so what I wanted to look at\nis, what are the drivers that"},"341":{"dur":3,"text":"turn a microbe into a pandemic?"},"345":{"dur":3,"text":"Cholera started in\nthe environment,"},"348":{"dur":1,"text":"which is where a\nlot of new microbes"},"350":{"dur":1,"text":"are coming out of today."},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"It comes out of a place\ncalled the Sundarbans."},"354":{"dur":0,"text":"This is pictured here."},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"It's where the major\nrivers of South Asia"},"357":{"dur":3,"text":"drain into the Bay of Bengal."},"360":{"dur":3,"text":"And the water here is\nhalf salty, half fresh."},"364":{"dur":1,"text":"It's quite alkaline."},"366":{"dur":1,"text":"And the bacteria that\ncauses cholera actually"},"368":{"dur":1,"text":"lives naturally in\nthis environment,"},"370":{"dur":2,"text":"and in similar environments\naround the world."},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"It lives in conjunction\nwith zooplankton."},"375":{"dur":3,"text":"And it actually is a peaceful\nand useful inhabitant"},"379":{"dur":1,"text":"in that environment."},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"It helps recycle nutrients."},"383":{"dur":1,"text":"And for a long\ntime, people didn't"},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"live in places like the\nsuperabundance of course"},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"it's covered in mangrove\nswamps the crocodiles there's"},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"tigers there's cyclones."},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"It's flooded by the\ntides twice a day."},"395":{"dur":3,"text":"That all changed, of\ncourse, when the British Raj"},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"decided to colonize\nthe Sundarbans"},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"and turn it into rice farms."},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"And this happened over the\ncourse of the 19th century."},"405":{"dur":4,"text":"Over 90% of the Sundarbans\nwas settled by people."},"410":{"dur":3,"text":"So quite suddenly, humans\nhad invaded the habitat"},"414":{"dur":1,"text":"of the cholera bacteria."},"415":{"dur":4,"text":"And this allowed the bacteria\nto spill over into our bodies."},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"And inside the human\nbody, the cholera bacteria"},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"performs a very\ndifferent function"},"424":{"dur":3,"text":"than it does in its\nnatural environment."},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you ingest a little\nbit of cholera bacteria,"},"430":{"dur":3,"text":"the bacteria will line\nthe interior of your gut."},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"And it actually reverses\nthe normal functioning"},"436":{"dur":5,"text":"of that organ, so that instead\nof nourishing the tissues"},"441":{"dur":3,"text":"in the body with fluids, the\ncholera-infected gut actually"},"445":{"dur":4,"text":"extracts fluids out of\nthe body and expels them"},"449":{"dur":5,"text":"in a massive torrent of\nwatery diarrhea and vomiting."},"454":{"dur":1,"text":"In fact, a person\ninfected with cholera"},"456":{"dur":3,"text":"can lose 15 liters\nof fluid a day."},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's what kills\nyou from cholera."},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"You basically just\ndehydrate to death."},"464":{"dur":0,"text":"You desiccate."},"465":{"dur":3,"text":"It can happen in\na matter of hours."},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"So the first pandemic of\ncholera began in the Sundarbans"},"471":{"dur":1,"text":"in 1817."},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"It started traveling\nup into Russia, out"},"475":{"dur":4,"text":"into this newly industrializing\ncities of the Old World."},"480":{"dur":1,"text":"But of course, to\ncause a pandemic,"},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"it has spread across\nto global populations."},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"It would have to\ncross the Atlantic."},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"And all of this is happening\nright at the transition"},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"from sail to steam."},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"So instead of taking eight\nweeks to cross the Atlantic,"},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"over the course of the\nearly 1800s, suddenly"},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"it was taking more\nlike one week."},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"And once we started\nbuilding steamships,"},"502":{"dur":4,"text":"we could go not just down our\nrivers but up them as well."},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"And then we used steam\nengines to build canals,"},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"like the Erie Canal\nwhich opened in 1825."},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"And that connected all\nthese waterways together."},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"So we had this nice\nnetwork of waterways."},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"It's like a highway system."},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was perfect for cholera\nto come over from London"},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"to Paris, over the\nAtlantic into Canada,"},"526":{"dur":5,"text":"and thence filter throughout\nthe interior of North America."},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"And of course, at this time we\nwere urbanizing really rapidly."},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"This was a new form\nof living in cities."},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"People are rushing\nout of the farms"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"into the cities for\nnew factory jobs."},"541":{"dur":4,"text":"Places like New York City were\nbecoming incredibly crowded."},"545":{"dur":3,"text":"Of course, there were no\nsubway hookups and highways"},"549":{"dur":3,"text":"to let people sprawl\noutside of the city center."},"553":{"dur":1,"text":"So everyone had\nto live near work"},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"or the possibility of work."},"556":{"dur":1,"text":"In the most crowded\nparts of New York City,"},"558":{"dur":4,"text":"there was about 77,000\npeople per square kilometer."},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's six times more\ncrowded than modern-day Tokyo."},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"It's also 1,000\ntimes more crowded"},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"than anyone had ever lived\nbefore-- brand-new way"},"570":{"dur":1,"text":"of living."},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"So suddenly, people are\nreally close together,"},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"They're touching\neach other more."},"577":{"dur":1,"text":"And they also created\na huge sanitary crisis."},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"So when people moved from\nthe farms to the cities,"},"583":{"dur":3,"text":"they didn't come up with a new\nway of managing human waste."},"587":{"dur":3,"text":"They basically just used that\nold system in the new place."},"591":{"dur":3,"text":"And the old system was simply\nto use outhouses and privies"},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"and cesspools, and let the\nhuman waste just kind of sink"},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"into the ground and decompose."},"599":{"dur":4,"text":"So that works OK in places where\nthere is not a lot of crowding,"},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"and there's enough\nroom for, and space"},"606":{"dur":1,"text":"for, this stuff to decompose."},"607":{"dur":1,"text":"But that's not what\nhappened in New York"},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"City and similar\nindustrialized cities."},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"Across New York, there's\nabout 1\/12 of the city"},"614":{"dur":4,"text":"was covered with cesspools,\nprivies, and outhouses."},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"There was no such sewer system\nto carry this stuff away"},"622":{"dur":1,"text":"and to treat it."},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"There weren't even\nany rules, actually,"},"625":{"dur":4,"text":"that you had to empty out\nyour outhouses or cesspools."},"630":{"dur":1,"text":"So all of this\nmaterial was allowed"},"631":{"dur":5,"text":"to simply sink into the ground,\nspill over into the streets,"},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"spill over into people's\nwells, and then down"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"into the groundwater."},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"The typical 19th\ncentury New Yorker"},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"was ingesting\nabout two teaspoons"},"647":{"dur":3,"text":"of fecal matter every day."},"650":{"dur":3,"text":"So you can imagine when cholera\ncame into a city like that,"},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"it just exploded."},"656":{"dur":3,"text":"And this happened\ntime and time again."},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, there were things that they\ncould have done even back then."},"664":{"dur":2,"text":"But there were\npolitical problems, too."},"666":{"dur":1,"text":"So the public health\ninfrastructure"},"668":{"dur":0,"text":"had just started out."},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"And meanwhile, this was the\nera of the robber barons."},"671":{"dur":3,"text":"Private interests had\nbecome incredibly powerful."},"674":{"dur":4,"text":"And when they objected to\ncertain public health measures,"},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"they were not inactive."},"681":{"dur":3,"text":"For example, in 1832,\nthe Governor of New York"},"685":{"dur":4,"text":"actually sent a doctor up to\nupstate New York and Canada"},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"to see what was happening--\nto do surveillance,"},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"see if cholera is going to\nthreaten the City of New York."},"694":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is the data that\nthat doctor collected"},"697":{"dur":3,"text":"in 1832, which we've mapped."},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"It shows a pretty clear picture."},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"Cholera is coming\ndown the Hudson River."},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"It's coming down the Erie Canal."},"706":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's heading straight\nfor New York City."},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"So the obvious\nthing, then, would"},"711":{"dur":3,"text":"have been to enact a\nquarantine on the waterways."},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"But they didn't, because\nprivate interests"},"717":{"dur":3,"text":"decided that that would be\nfar too disruptive to trade."},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"And so cholera was allowed\nto come down these waterways"},"723":{"dur":1,"text":"again and again."},"725":{"dur":1,"text":"In fact, there\nwere companies that"},"727":{"dur":5,"text":"were making money selling\ncholera-contaminated water"},"732":{"dur":1,"text":"to the people of New York."},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"The epicenter of a lot of the\ncholera epidemics happened"},"736":{"dur":3,"text":"in a slum called Five Points,\nwhich is pictured here."},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"If you've ever seen the movie\n\"Gangs of New York,\" the Martin"},"742":{"dur":3,"text":"Scorsese movie, that's\nactually about Five Points."},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"So this was the epicenter of a\nlot of the cholera epidemics."},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"And this slum, unlike\nthe rest of Manhattan,"},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"which is built on\nbedrock, this slum"},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"was actually built on\nwhat was once a pond."},"755":{"dur":3,"text":"It was the only source of\nfresh water in Manhattan."},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"That pond had been\nfilled up with garbage."},"761":{"dur":3,"text":"And then the slum had\nbeen built on top of it."},"764":{"dur":3,"text":"So the ground underneath\nthe slum was very unstable."},"768":{"dur":1,"text":"It was low lying."},"769":{"dur":2,"text":"And of course, the\ngroundwater underneath it"},"772":{"dur":2,"text":"was very easily\ncontaminated with all"},"775":{"dur":4,"text":"of the outhouses and privies\nof the slum on top of it."},"779":{"dur":4,"text":"But the company that the\nState of New York chartered"},"783":{"dur":3,"text":"to deliver drinking water\nto the people of New York,"},"787":{"dur":3,"text":"rather than tap upstream sources\nof water-- which they knew"},"791":{"dur":3,"text":"would be fresher and which\nwould taste better-- they"},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"decided to save money,\nkind of like what"},"797":{"dur":1,"text":"happened in Flint, Michigan."},"798":{"dur":4,"text":"They sank their well right\nin the middle of that slum."},"803":{"dur":2,"text":"And they delivered\nthat water to one-third"},"805":{"dur":2,"text":"of the people of New York."},"807":{"dur":3,"text":"And this happened repeatedly\nthroughout the 1800s."},"810":{"dur":2,"text":"And the reason they did that--\nactually, the person who"},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"was behind all of these\nmachinations that allowed this"},"815":{"dur":3,"text":"to happen was the notorious\nAaron Burr, who we all"},"819":{"dur":4,"text":"love to hate now-- the bad\nboy of the American founding."},"824":{"dur":2,"text":"And the reason he did\nthat is because he wanted"},"826":{"dur":3,"text":"to start a bank-- the Bank\nof the Manhattan Company,"},"829":{"dur":3,"text":"of course, which ended up\nbeing incredibly powerful."},"833":{"dur":2,"text":"Do any of you guys know\nwhat the bank of the company"},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"is called today?"},"837":{"dur":4,"text":"It's JP Morgan Chase-- the\nbiggest bank in the country."},"844":{"dur":2,"text":"So it wasn't just political\ndefenses that failed."},"846":{"dur":3,"text":"It was also medical\ndefenses that failed."},"849":{"dur":3,"text":"Doctors simply applied their\nthinking on old diseases"},"853":{"dur":1,"text":"to the new disease."},"855":{"dur":1,"text":"So the old way of\nthinking about diseases"},"857":{"dur":3,"text":"was that they were caused\nby what were called miasmas."},"861":{"dur":2,"text":"These were basically\nstinky airs that"},"863":{"dur":3,"text":"rise up from decomposing\norganic material."},"866":{"dur":2,"text":"And the idea is\nthat these stinky"},"869":{"dur":2,"text":"airs-- if you inhale\nthem, you get sick."},"871":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, this is based on a\n2000-year-old Hippocratic"},"875":{"dur":1,"text":"theory."},"876":{"dur":1,"text":"And it made a certain\namount of sense"},"878":{"dur":2,"text":"for old diseases like,\nsay, malaria, which"},"880":{"dur":1,"text":"isn't carried by stinky air."},"882":{"dur":1,"text":"But certainly the mosquitoes\nthat carry malaria"},"884":{"dur":2,"text":"would be more likely to\nexist in the sulfurous airs"},"887":{"dur":3,"text":"around swamps and\nthings like that."},"890":{"dur":3,"text":"But when applied to a\nnew disease like cholera,"},"893":{"dur":3,"text":"miasmatism could make\nthe disease much worse."},"896":{"dur":2,"text":"So for example, in\nthe city of London,"},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"over the course of\nthe 1700s and 1800s,"},"901":{"dur":2,"text":"people had started\ninstalling water closets,"},"903":{"dur":2,"text":"or what we know\nas flush toilets."},"906":{"dur":2,"text":"And they thought this would\nbe really healthy for them,"},"909":{"dur":3,"text":"because it would get rid of all\nthe bad smells of human waste."},"912":{"dur":2,"text":"You rid the stuff, read\nthe smell out of your home,"},"915":{"dur":4,"text":"out of your street, and\njust flush it all away."},"919":{"dur":3,"text":"But the thing is, they didn't\ncare about the contents"},"922":{"dur":1,"text":"of the flushed toilets."},"924":{"dur":2,"text":"All they cared\nabout was the smell."},"926":{"dur":3,"text":"So they didn't mind\nthat the contents of all"},"929":{"dur":3,"text":"of these flush toilets\nwas dumped directly"},"932":{"dur":4,"text":"into the River Thames, which\nwas their drinking water."},"937":{"dur":2,"text":"And in fact, after\nevery cholera outbreak"},"939":{"dur":2,"text":"the people of London\ninstalled more flush"},"942":{"dur":2,"text":"toilets to dump more\nof their human waste"},"944":{"dur":3,"text":"into the drinking\nwater, rather than less."},"948":{"dur":1,"text":"So the other question\nI wanted to ask"},"950":{"dur":2,"text":"is, could this happen again?"},"952":{"dur":2,"text":"And I went around to\nplaces where new pathogens"},"955":{"dur":3,"text":"are emerging today to try to\nsee how the story of cholera"},"959":{"dur":2,"text":"could shed light on\nwhat might happen"},"961":{"dur":1,"text":"with these other new pathogens."},"963":{"dur":2,"text":"And what I found is,\nthose same drivers"},"965":{"dur":3,"text":"that brought cholera into\nhuman populations in the 1900s"},"969":{"dur":4,"text":"are being recreated today,\nbut on a global scale."},"973":{"dur":3,"text":"So we're invading wild habitat\non a scale never seen before."},"976":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's because our\npopulations are growing,"},"979":{"dur":2,"text":"and also, our industrial\ndevelopments are growing."},"981":{"dur":2,"text":"And what this means is that\nwe're disrupting and invading"},"984":{"dur":2,"text":"a lot of wildlife habitat."},"987":{"dur":4,"text":"And as we do that, humans come\ninto novel, intimate contact"},"992":{"dur":3,"text":"with different wild\nanimals, wild species."},"996":{"dur":2,"text":"And that
