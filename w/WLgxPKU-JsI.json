He\nhas told us the point, and then he is going"},"380":{"dur":4,"text":"to show us again and again.

He showed us this. He had the"},"480":{"dur":5,"text":"two containers both of them filled with air.\nThen he pumped more air in one. He showed"},"485":{"dur":4,"text":"how air actually does have weight. Well, the\natmosphere of course is made up of air. If"},"490":{"dur":4,"text":"air has weight, then the atmosphere has weight.\nSo instead of talking about suction, which"},"494":{"dur":4,"text":"kind of implies that vacuum has this force\nthat\u2019s driving inward. He talks about the"},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"weight of the air actually pushing down."},"501":{"dur":1,"text":"Faraday: That was done entirely by the weight"},"503":{"dur":4,"text":"of the air pressing on it, and you can easily\nunderstand how that is."},"507":{"dur":5,"text":"Bill: So what\u2019s kind of interesting to me\nabout this demonstration just looking at Faraday\u2019s"},"512":{"dur":5,"text":"lecture technique is that this is the only\ntime he has used a schematic demonstration."},"517":{"dur":7,"text":"So he didn\u2019t have something actual to show\nus, so he is using this kind of illustrative"},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"way with a set of blocks to show us what\u2019s\ngoing on."},"527":{"dur":4,"text":"Don: This is something similar to what we\ndid, but we had the advantage of having something"},"532":{"dur":4,"text":"like PowerPoint, so we were able to show a\nlot of graphics.

You can buy these spheres just"},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"to do this like we bought them from some chemistry\nsupply house."},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"Don: So it\u2019s important to point out here\nthat it looks as though the pressure is increasing"},"561":{"dur":4,"text":"by the gauge, but that\u2019s actually the amount\nbelow atmosphere pressure that it\u2019s decreasing."},"566":{"dur":5,"text":"Bill: You can see here already how hard these\nare to pull apart.
