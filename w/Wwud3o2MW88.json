quite deliberately quite early on"},"269":{"dur":3,"text":"decided that I was actually going to pretend to be a private secretary"},"273":{"dur":3,"text":"ans I dressed like them, and I went out to the W.H.

noticeable,"},"283":{"dur":1,"text":"And after the first few weeks,"},"284":{"dur":2,"text":"the permanent secretaries got bored with the joke of"},"287":{"dur":3,"text":"'Here's my personal

there"},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"for example, Estelle Morris was very, very good"},"322":{"dur":3,"text":"about access at what was a very, very difficult time for her"},"326":{"dur":2,"text":"because I was there at the events"},"328":{"dur":2,"text":"which eventually culminated in her resignation."},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"I was allowed into various meetings where she was

result of the Iraq war, it became very, very clear"},"365":{"dur":3,"text":"Blair lost all interest in education"},"368":{"dur":1,"text":"He had other things to think about,"},"370":{"dur":3,"text":"So I was actually in a situation where the prime minister at that time,"},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"was not targeting particular departments,"},"376":{"dur":2,"text":"was not getting involved in their particular policy making,"},"378":{"dur":3,"text":"and that might of skewed the results to the extent that,"},"381":{"dur":3,"text":"the departments had a tad more autonomy from the prime minister"},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"than might have been true at other times."},"387":{"dur":3,"text":"So I note that sort of, in passing, as a possible odd circumstance"},"391":{"dur":3,"text":"but frankly, for this kind of research, that is one of the problems."},"394":{"dur":3,"text":"You go in intensively, for a particular period of

done that kind of work."},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"But nonetheless, I'm just trying to be straight about it"},"408":{"dur":3,"text":"so you can see the kinds of problems that might arise."},"411":{"dur":2,"text":"Now then, the picture that comes out"},"414":{"dur":4,"text":"I can't possibly summarise in a short lecture when I've got other things to do,"},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"The thing I want to emphasise, is that I think I found"},"422":{"dur":3,"text":"A storytelling political administrative elite."},"426":{"dur":4,"text":"And there are two points about that, first of all storytelling is something I'll talk about later,"},"430":{"dur":1,"text":"but they do it all the time."},"432":{"dur":1,"text":"'Have we got our story straight',"},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"is an expression that you get regularly from them"},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"whether they're appearing before a select committee"},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"going to do a media press conference, or whatever else,"},"442":{"dur":3,"text":"it is they have to do that particular day,"},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"bu the phrase that I really want to stress"},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"is political administrative elite,"},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"and I freely admit that I'm going all the way back"},"452":{"dur":3,"text":"to Heclo and Wildavsky and 'The Private Government of Public Money',"},"455":{"dur":4,"text":"in which they argue that ministers and their permanent secretaries,"},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"should both be seen as political administrators."},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"The opposite sides of the same coin."},"465":{"dur":3,"text":"They think that the notion that the minister's got one set of duties"},"468":{"dur":3,"text":"which are completely separate from the permanent secretary who's got another set of duties,"},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"is an idea that they are trying to undermine"},"474":{"dur":3,"text":"and get at the idea that they're both in this mess together."},"478":{"dur":5,"text":"And they live or die by their ability to support one another in it."},"483":{"dur":3,"text":"And in my experience, the three ministers that I followed closely,"},"487":{"dur":3,"text":"were indeed extremely close to their permanent

me,"},"496":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't have to like him,"},"498":{"dur":3,"text":"what I've got to do is get a good working relationship with him,"},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"which is what he did, \nand in that sense they were very close,"},"504":{"dur":3,"text":"and that was for me, the dominant characteristic of it."},"507":{"dur":4,"text":"And so often we get this ministers versus civil servants"},"511":{"dur":3,"text":"kind of motif, imposed on civil service reform,"},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"and it just wasn't the way they behaved in their every day life"},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"when I was observing them."},"520":{"dur":3,"text":"Now that is the theme I want to pull out of the fieldwork"},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"because it's going to recur at a number of points, and what I've done is"},"526":{"dur":3,"text":"drawn five lessons from the fieldwork,"},"529":{"dur":4,"text":"which I think say something that is relevant to anybody to who wants to try and

went,"},"657":{"dur":3,"text":"the more prominent that characteristic became."},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"Because their job was actually to domesticate"},"663":{"dur":3,"text":"a very, very unruly life

do?"},"840":{"dur":3,"text":"How's about introducing a new I.T. system?"},"843":{"dur":3,"text":"Then may be we'll have an internal reorganization."},"846":{"dur":4,"text":"Then maybe we'll adopt the

time?"},"901":{"dur":2,"text":"To a resounding silence."},"903":{"dur":3,"text":"Because of course, for everybody in the room, there was no last time."},"906":{"dur":2,"text":"Because they weren't there last time."},"909":{"dur":3,"text":"And they didn't know where to go and look to find where last time was!"},"912":{"dur":4,"text":"So what happened is the secretary gets very, very brave and
