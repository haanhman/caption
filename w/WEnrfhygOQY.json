job."},"725":{"dur":5,"text":"I actually wasn't thinking about that at the\ntime."},"731":{"dur":6,"text":"But I learned that the things that people\nrediscovered in the Renaissance, in the

questions\nand it wasn't easy to answer those questions,"},"810":{"dur":6,"text":"that's why they wrote pages and pages of philosophy\ntrying to answer those questions."},"816":{"dur":4,"text":"Perspective is about placing yourself in context."},"820":{"dur":8,"text":"Knowing that while each of us have unique\ngifts, that all of us share a common experience."},"828":{"dur":6,"text":"And that process of going through thousands\nof pages to twenty pages to ten pages to five"},"835":{"dur":7,"text":"to two, I was learning judgment, because what\nis judgment?"},"843":{"dur":5,"text":"Judgment is deciding what's important and\nwhat's not."},"848":{"dur":6,"text":"Judgment is deciding, you know there's lots\nof information but this piece

I did, with apologies to any lawyers\nin the room, I did what a lot of people at"},"898":{"dur":3,"text":"that time with liberal arts degrees did, I\nwent off to law school."},"901":{"dur":2,"text":"That's what my dad wanted."},"903":{"dur":4,"text":"He was a law professor who ultimately became\na federal judge."},"907":{"dur":2,"text":"I went off to law

mother said, \"What are you going to do?\""},"982":{"dur":2,"text":"The answer I don't know."},"985":{"dur":7,"text":"But I did know this: I knew somehow even at\n23 years old, I knew that if I didn't love"},"992":{"dur":3,"text":"it I couldn't be good at it."},"995":{"dur":3,"text":"And I didn't want to spend my life at it."},"999":{"dur":2,"text":"So now I had to go to work."},"1001":{"dur":1,"text":"So what did I know how to do?"},"1003":{"dur":2,"text":"I knew how to type."},"1006":{"dur":1,"text":"So I go to the want ads."},"1007":{"dur":5,"text":"I answer the
