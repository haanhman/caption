Reconstruction era."},"1536":{"dur":3,"text":"The relationship between the federal government\nand the states, the balance of power in our"},"1540":{"dur":6,"text":"federal system, was, again,

Klan and similar organizations\nwhich can only be described as terrorist groups,"},"1563":{"dur":3,"text":"thrived in some places during Reconstruction."},"1566":{"dur":6,"text":"And the question of how to deal with terrorism\nwas very much on the public agenda in the"},"1573":{"dur":3,"text":"late 1860s, early 1870s."},"1577":{"dur":5,"text":"And the relationship between political and\neconomic democracy, something that's also"},"1582":{"dur":9,"text":"on our political agenda today, was a Reconstruction\nquestion, much debated very vigorously then."},"1592":{"dur":4,"text":"So my point is, and one could go on with this,\nyou can't really understand American society"},"1597":{"dur":4,"text":"today without knowing something about Reconstruction."},"1601":{"dur":6,"text":"But perhaps most importantly, from our perspective\ntonight, Reconstruction was a pivotal moment"},"1607":{"dur":3,"text":"in the history of American democracy."},"1610":{"dur":1,"text":"Many years ago the great W.E.B."},"1612":{"dur":6,"text":"Du Bois wrote a book \"Black Reconstruction\nin America\" which was a pioneering effort"},"1618":{"dur":2,"text":"to rethink the history of that

Reconstruction"},"1654":{"dur":5,"text":"is also a prime example of what we call the\npolitics of history."},"1660":{"dur":4,"text":"I don't mean by that whether the historian\nis a democrat or a republican or something"},"1664":{"dur":1,"text":"like that."},"1665":{"dur":7,"text":"I mean by the politics of history the way\nin which historical interpretation, both reflects"},"1673":{"dur":5,"text":"and helps to shape the world in which the\nhistorian is writing."},"1679":{"dur":6,"text":"As many of you know, for many, many years,\nreally most of the 20th

democracy."},"1704":{"dur":3,"text":"President Abraham Lincoln, according to this\ninterpretation, at the end of the Civil War"},"1707":{"dur":7,"text":"wanted to bring the defeated South back into\nthe Union in a quick, lenient, forgiving manner."},"1715":{"dur":6,"text":"After his assassination, his policy was continued\nby his successor, Andrew Johnson, but Johnson"},"1721":{"dur":5,"text":"was thwarted, according to this view, by the\nvillains of the piece, the radical Republicans,"},"1726":{"dur":2,"text":"in Congress."},"1728":{"dur":3,"text":"Motivated either -- depending on which book\nyou read, either by a vindictive hatred of"},"1732":{"dur":6,"text":"the South or the desire to fasten the grip\nof Northern capitalism upon the South or simply"},"1739":{"dur":4,"text":"the desire to keep the Republican Party in\npower."},"1743":{"dur":5,"text":"Whatever their motivation, they overthrew\nJohnson's

people were\njust incapable of exercising democratic rights"},"1760":{"dur":4,"text":"intelligently; they should not be part of\npolitical democracy."},"1764":{"dur":6,"text":"And what happened was an orgy of corruption\nand misgovernment presided over by carpetbaggers,"},"1771":{"dur":6,"text":"that is Northerners who came down to reap\nthe spoils of office, scalawags, as they were"},"1778":{"dur":6,"text":"called, white southerners who abandoned their\nrace and cooperated with blacks, and the African"},"1784":{"dur":2,"text":"Americans themselves."},"1787":{"dur":6,"text":"Eventually, according to this view, the patriotic\nsociety is like the Ku Klux Klan, overthrew"},"1793":{"dur":6,"text":"these governments and restored what was politely\ncalled home rule or what we would call honestly"},"1799":{"dur":3,"text":"white supremacy in the South."},"1802":{"dur":6,"text":"This view received a scholarly impression\nover 100 years

about the politics of history?"},"1841":{"dur":1,"text":"This view had an amazing longevity."},"1843":{"dur":4,"text":"We historians make our living by overturning\nprevious interpretations."},"1847":{"dur":1,"text":"Right?"},"1848":{"dur":8,"text":"That's what we do, to remain the standard\nview for 50, 60, 70 years is unprecedented,"},"1856":{"dur":1,"text":"really unprecedented."},"1857":{"dur":6,"text":"But from 1900 to the 1960s, this was the standard\nview of Reconstruction."},"1863":{"dur":7,"text":"What explains its longevity is that this view\nof Reconstruction was congruent with the racial"},"1871":{"dur":4,"text":"system of the United States from 1900 until\nthe Civil Rights era."},"1875":{"dur":6,"text":"In other words, this view was part of the\nintellectual justification of the Jim Crow"},"1882":{"dur":1,"text":"South."},"1883":{"dur":2,"text":"The lessons of that were very clear."},"1885":{"dur":5,"text":"One, it was a mistake to give black people\nthe right to vote; they misused it."},"1891":{"dur":4,"text":"Therefore, any effort to restore the right\nto vote to black people that had been taken"},"1896":{"dur":5,"text":"away around 1900 in the southern states, any\nof effort to restore the right to vote should"},"1901":{"dur":7,"text":"be resisted because it would just lead to\nanother example of the horrors of Reconstruction."},"1908":{"dur":7,"text":"Secondly, Reconstruction was imposed on the\nSouth by northern outsiders."},"1916":{"dur":4,"text":"Maybe some of them were even motivated by\nhumanitarian sentiment."},"1920":{"dur":5,"text":"But nonetheless, it proved that outsiders\ndon't really understand southern race relations"},"1925":{"dur":6,"text":"and the White South should resist outside\ncriticism which began to develop in the 1930s"},"1932":{"dur":1,"text":"and 40s."},"1933":{"dur":6,"text":"Again, if race relations changed, the horrors\nof Reconstruction would be revisited."},"1939":{"dur":5,"text":"And finally, and this is a little arcane now,\nReconstruction was a strong argument for what"},"1944":{"dur":6,"text":"used to be called the solid Democratic South\nbecause Reconstruction was granted by the"},"1950":{"dur":7,"text":"Republican party and southern democrats insisted\nif white people voted Republican, would get"},"1957":{"dur":1,"text":"another Reconstruction again."},"1959":{"dur":5,"text":"The memory of Reconstruction was used as a\nmark of the solid south."},"1965":{"dur":7,"text":"In fact, Claude
