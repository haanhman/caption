{"0":{"dur":7,"text":"Translator: Joseph Geni\nReviewer: Joanna Pietrulewicz"},"12":{"dur":1,"text":"So earlier this year,"},"14":{"dur":3,"text":"I was informed that I would be\ndoing a TED Talk."},"18":{"dur":1,"text":"So I was excited, then I panicked,"},"20":{"dur":2,"text":"then I was excited, then I panicked,"},"22":{"dur":2,"text":"and in between the excitement\nand the panicking,"},"24":{"dur":2,"text":"I started to do my research,"},"27":{"dur":4,"text":"and my research primarily consisted\nof Googling how to give a great TED Talk."},"31":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"32":{"dur":1,"text":"And interspersed with that,"},"34":{"dur":2,"text":"I was Googling Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie."},"37":{"dur":1,"text":"How many of you know who that is?"},"38":{"dur":2,"text":"(Cheers)"},"41":{"dur":2,"text":"So I was Googling her\nbecause I always Google her"},"44":{"dur":1,"text":"because I'm just a fan,"},"45":{"dur":3,"text":"but also because she always has\nimportant and interesting things to say."},"49":{"dur":3,"text":"And the combination of those searches"},"52":{"dur":2,"text":"kept leading me to her talk"},"55":{"dur":3,"text":"on the dangers of a single story,"},"58":{"dur":3,"text":"on what happens\nwhen we have a solitary lens"},"61":{"dur":2,"text":"through which to understand\ncertain groups of people,"},"64":{"dur":1,"text":"and it is the perfect talk."},"67":{"dur":4,"text":"It's the talk that I would have given\nif I had been famous first."},"72":{"dur":2,"text":"(Laughter)"},"74":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, and you know,\nlike, she's African and I'm African,"},"77":{"dur":1,"text":"and she's a feminist and I'm a feminist,"},"79":{"dur":2,"text":"and she's a storyteller\nand I'm a storyteller,"},"81":{"dur":1,"text":"so I really felt like it's my talk."},"83":{"dur":2,"text":"(Laughter)"},"86":{"dur":3,"text":"So I decided that I was going\nto learn how to code,"},"89":{"dur":2,"text":"and then I was going to hack the internet"},"91":{"dur":3,"text":"and I would take down all the copies\nof that talk that existed,"},"95":{"dur":1,"text":"and then I would memorize it,"},"97":{"dur":3,"text":"and then I would come here\nand deliver it as if it was my own speech."},"100":{"dur":3,"text":"So that plan was going really well,\nexcept the coding part,"},"103":{"dur":3,"text":"and then one morning a few months ago,"},"107":{"dur":1,"text":"I woke up"},"109":{"dur":5,"text":"to the news that the wife\nof a certain presidential candidate"},"114":{"dur":2,"text":"had given a speech that --"},"117":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"119":{"dur":2,"text":"(Applause)"},"124":{"dur":4,"text":"that sounded eerily like a speech\ngiven by one of my other faves,"},"129":{"dur":1,"text":"Michelle Obama."},"130":{"dur":2,"text":"(Cheers)"},"132":{"dur":4,"text":"And so I decided that I should\nprobably write my own TED Talk,"},"137":{"dur":2,"text":"and so that is what I am here to do."},"139":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm here to talk about\nmy own observations about storytelling."},"144":{"dur":3,"text":"I want to talk to you\nabout the power of stories, of course,"},"148":{"dur":2,"text":"but I also want to talk\nabout their limitations,"},"151":{"dur":4,"text":"particularly for those of us\nwho are interested in social justice."},"156":{"dur":2,"text":"So since Adichie gave that talk\nseven years ago,"},"159":{"dur":2,"text":"there has been a boom in storytelling."},"161":{"dur":2,"text":"Stories are everywhere,"},"164":{"dur":3,"text":"and if there was a danger\nin the telling of one tired old tale,"},"168":{"dur":4,"text":"then I think there has got to be\nlots to celebrate about the flourishing"},"172":{"dur":2,"text":"of so many stories and so many voices."},"175":{"dur":2,"text":"Stories are the antidote to bias."},"178":{"dur":5,"text":"In fact, today, if you are middle class\nand connected via the internet,"},"184":{"dur":3,"text":"you can download stories\nat the touch of a button"},"187":{"dur":1,"text":"or the swipe of a screen."},"188":{"dur":1,"text":"You can listen to a podcast"},"190":{"dur":3,"text":"about what it's like\nto grow up Dalit in Kolkata."},"194":{"dur":2,"text":"You can hear an indigenous\nman in Australia"},"196":{"dur":4,"text":"talk about the trials and triumphs\nof raising his children in dignity"},"201":{"dur":1,"text":"and in pride."},"202":{"dur":1,"text":"Stories make us fall in love."},"204":{"dur":3,"text":"They heal rifts and they bridge divides."},"207":{"dur":1,"text":"Stories can even make it easier for us"},"209":{"dur":2,"text":"to talk about the deaths\nof people in our societies"},"212":{"dur":2,"text":"who don't matter,\nbecause they make us care."},"214":{"dur":1,"text":"Right?"},"216":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not so sure,"},"218":{"dur":3,"text":"and I actually work for a place\ncalled the Centre for Stories."},"221":{"dur":4,"text":"And my job is to help to tell stories"},"226":{"dur":3,"text":"that challenge mainstream narratives\nabout what it means to be black"},"229":{"dur":3,"text":"or a Muslim or a refugee\nor any of those other categories"},"232":{"dur":3,"text":"that we talk about all the time."},"235":{"dur":1,"text":"But I come to this work"},"237":{"dur":3,"text":"after a long history\nas a social justice activist,"},"240":{"dur":2,"text":"and so I'm really interested in the ways"},"242":{"dur":2,"text":"that people talk\nabout nonfiction storytelling"},"245":{"dur":2,"text":"as though it's about\nmore than entertainment,"},"247":{"dur":2,"text":"as though it's about being\na catalyst for social action."},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not uncommon to hear people say"},"254":{"dur":3,"text":"that stories make\nthe world a better place."},"258":{"dur":3,"text":"Increasingly, though, I worry\nthat even the most poignant stories,"},"262":{"dur":3,"text":"particularly the stories about people\nwho no one seems to care about,"},"266":{"dur":3,"text":"can often get in the way\nof action towards social justice."},"269":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, this is not because\nstorytellers mean any harm."},"273":{"dur":1,"text":"Quite the contrary."},"274":{"dur":4,"text":"Storytellers are often do-gooders\nlike me and, I suspect, yourselves."},"279":{"dur":3,"text":"And the audiences of storytellers"},"282":{"dur":3,"text":"are often deeply compassionate\nand empathetic people."},"286":{"dur":4,"text":"Still, good intentions\ncan have unintended consequences,"},"291":{"dur":4,"text":"and so I want to propose that stories\nare not as magical as they seem."},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"So three -- because\nit's always got to be three --"},"298":{"dur":2,"text":"three reasons why I think"},"300":{"dur":4,"text":"that stories don't necessarily\nmake the world a better place."},"306":{"dur":4,"text":"Firstly, stories can create\nan illusion of solidarity."},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"There is nothing\nlike that feel-good factor you get"},"312":{"dur":2,"text":"from listening to a fantastic story"},"315":{"dur":3,"text":"where you feel like you\nclimbed that mountain, right,"},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"or that you befriended\nthat death row inmate."},"321":{"dur":1,"text":"But you didn't."},"323":{"dur":1,"text":"You haven't done anything."},"325":{"dur":1,"text":"Listening is an important"},"326":{"dur":2,"text":"but insufficient step\ntowards social action."},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"Secondly, I think often we are drawn"},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"towards characters and protagonists"},"336":{"dur":3,"text":"who are likable and human."},"340":{"dur":1,"text":"And this makes sense, of course, right?"},"342":{"dur":3,"text":"Because if you like someone,\nthen you care about them."},"345":{"dur":1,"text":"But the inverse is also true."},"347":{"dur":1,"text":"If you don't like someone,"},"349":{"dur":1,"text":"then you don't care about them."},"351":{"dur":1,"text":"And if you don't care about them,"},"353":{"dur":3,"text":"you don't have to see yourself\nas having a moral obligation"},"356":{"dur":3,"text":"to think about the circumstances\nthat shaped their lives."},"361":{"dur":3,"text":"I learned this lesson\nwhen I was 14 years old."},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"I learned that actually,\nyou don't have to like someone"},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"to recognize their wisdom,"},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"and you certainly\ndon't have to like someone"},"370":{"dur":1,"text":"to take a stand by their side."},"372":{"dur":1,"text":"So my bike was stolen"},"375":{"dur":1,"text":"while I was riding it --"},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"378":{"dur":3,"text":"which is possible if you're\nriding slowly enough, which I was."},"381":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"So one minute\nI'm cutting across this field"},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"in the Nairobi neighborhood\nwhere I grew up,"},"388":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's like a very bumpy path,"},"391":{"dur":1,"text":"and so when you're riding a bike,"},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"you don't want to be like, you know --"},"395":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"398":{"dur":4,"text":"And so I'm going like this,\nslowly pedaling,"},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"and all of a sudden, I'm on the floor."},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm on the ground, and I look up,"},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"and there's this kid peddling away\nin the getaway vehicle,"},"410":{"dur":1,"text":"which is my bike,"},"411":{"dur":3,"text":"and he's about 11 or 12 years old,\nand I'm on the floor,"},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'm crying because I saved\na lot of money for that bike,"},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'm crying and I stand up\nand I start screaming."},"420":{"dur":4,"text":"Instinct steps in,\nand I start screaming, \"Mwizi, mwizi!\""},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"which means \"thief\" in Swahili."},"427":{"dur":5,"text":"And out of the woodworks,\nall of these people come out"},"432":{"dur":1,"text":"and they start to give chase."},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"This is Africa, so mob justice in action."},"436":{"dur":1,"text":"Right?"},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"And I round the corner,\nand they've captured him,"},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"they've caught him."},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"The suspect has been apprehended,"},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"and they make him give me my bike back,"},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"and they also make him apologize."},"449":{"dur":3,"text":"Again, you know,\ntypical African justice, right?"},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"And so they make him say sorry."},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we stand there facing each other,"},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"and he looks at me, and he says sorry,"},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"but he looks at me\nwith this unbridled fury."},"463":{"dur":3,"text":"He is very, very angry."},"467":{"dur":3,"text":"And it is the first time that I have been\nconfronted with someone"},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"who doesn't like me\nsimply because of what I represent."},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"He looks at me\nwith this look as if to say,"},"475":{"dur":3,"text":"\"You, with your shiny skin\nand your bike, you're angry at me?\""},"481":{"dur":3,"text":"So it was a hard lesson\nthat he didn't like me,"},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"but you know what, he was right."},"486":{"dur":3,"text":"I was a middle-class kid\nliving in a poor country."},"490":{"dur":3,"text":"I had a bike, and he barely had food."},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"Sometimes, it's the messages\nthat we don't want to hear,"},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"the ones that make us\nwant to crawl out of ourselves,"},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"that we need to hear the most."},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"For every lovable storyteller\nwho steals your heart,"},"505":{"dur":4,"text":"there are hundreds more\nwhose voices are slurred and ragged,"},"509":{"dur":4,"text":"who don't get to stand up on a stage\ndressed in fine clothes like this."},"514":{"dur":4,"text":"There are a million\nangry-boy-on-a-bike stories"},"518":{"dur":1,"text":"and we can't afford to ignore them"},"520":{"dur":3,"text":"simply because we don't like\ntheir protagonists"},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"or because that's not the kid\nthat we would bring home with us"},"526":{"dur":1,"text":"from the orphanage."},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"The third reason that I think"},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"that stories don't necessarily\nmake the world a better place"},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"is that too often we are so invested\nin the personal narrative"},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"that we forget\nto look at the bigger picture."},"540":{"dur":1,"text":"And so we applaud someone"},"542":{"dur":2,"text":"when they tell us\nabout their feelings of shame,"},"545":{"dur":3,"text":"but we don't necessarily\nlink that to oppression."},"549":{"dur":3,"text":"We nod understandingly\nwhen someone says they felt small,"},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"but we don't link that to discrimination."},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"The most important stories,\nespecially for social justice,"},"558":{"dur":1,"text":"are those that do both,"},"560":{"dur":4,"text":"that are both personal and allow us\nto explore and understand the political."},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"But it's not just\nabout the stories we like"},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"versus the stories we choose to ignore."},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"Increasingly, we are living in a society\nwhere there are larger forces at play,"},"573":{"dur":4,"text":"where stories are actually for many people\nbeginning to replace the news."},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah?"},"579":{"dur":3,"text":"We live in a time where we are witnessing\nthe decline of facts,"},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"when emotions rule"},"585":{"dur":3,"text":"and analysis, it's kind of boring, right?"},"588":{"dur":4,"text":"Where we value what we feel\nmore than what we actually know."},"594":{"dur":4,"text":"A recent report by the Pew Center\non trends in America"},"598":{"dur":5,"text":"indicates that only 10 percent\nof young adults under the age of 30"},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"\"place a lot of trust in the media.\""},"607":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, this is significant."},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"It means that storytellers\nare gaining trust"},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"at precisely the same moment"},"613":{"dur":3,"text":"that many in the media\nare losing the confidence in the public."},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"This is not a good thing,"},"620":{"dur":1,"text":"because while stories are important"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"and they help us\nto have insights in many ways,"},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"we need the media."},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"From my years\nas a social justice activist,"},"629":{"dur":6,"text":"I know very well that we need\ncredible facts from media institutions"},"635":{"dur":4,"text":"combined with the powerful voices\nof storytellers."},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"That's what pushes the needle forward\nin terms of social justice."},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"In the final analysis, of course,"},"648":{"dur":1,"text":"it is justice"},"650":{"dur":1,"text":"that makes the world a better place,"},"652":{"dur":1,"text":"not stories. Right?"},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"And so if it is justice that we are after,"},"658":{"dur":3,"text":"then I think we mustn't focus\non the media or on storytellers."},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"We must focus on audiences,"},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"on anyone who has ever turned on a radio"},"667":{"dur":1,"text":"or listened to a podcast,"},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"and that means all of us."},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"So a few concluding thoughts"},"673":{"dur":3,"text":"on what audiences can do\nto make the world a better place."},"678":{"dur":3,"text":"So firstly, the world\nwould be a better place, I think,"},"681":{"dur":3,"text":"if audiences were more curious\nand more skeptical"},"685":{"dur":2,"text":"and asked more questions\nabout the social context"},"688":{"dur":3,"text":"that created those stories\nthat they love so much."},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"Secondly, the world\nwould be a better place"},"694":{"dur":3,"text":"if audiences recognized\nthat storytelling is intellectual work."},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think it would\nbe important for audiences"},"702":{"dur":5,"text":"to demand more buttons\non their favorite websites,"},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"buttons for example that say,"},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"\"If you liked this story,"},"712":{"dur":4,"text":"click here to support a cause\nyour storyteller believes in.\""},"716":{"dur":5,"text":"Or \"click here to contribute\nto your storyteller's next big idea.\""},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"Often, we are committed to the platforms,"},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"but not necessarily\nto the storytellers themselves."},"727":{"dur":5,"text":"And then lastly, I think that audiences\ncan make the world a better place"},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"by switching off their phones,"},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"by stepping away from their screens"},"737":{"dur":4,"text":"and stepping out into the real world\nbeyond what feels safe."},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"Alice Walker has said,"},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Look closely at the present\nyou are constructing."},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"It should look like the future\nyou are dreaming.\""},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"Storytellers can help us to dream,"},"754":{"dur":3,"text":"but it's up to all of us\nto have a plan for justice."},"759":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you."},"760":{"dur":4,"text":"(Applause)"}}
