together,"},"98":{"dur":3,"text":"I want to talk about basically\nthe quick introduction of what"},"102":{"dur":3,"text":"I do, why it's important,\nthen a quick summary of why"},"106":{"dur":2,"text":"sabermetrics has changed\nthe game of baseball,"},"108":{"dur":2,"text":"why analytical thinking is\nchanging the game of baseball,"},"111":{"dur":3,"text":"and then try to come up\nto current technologies"},"115":{"dur":4,"text":"and current data that's being\nused to try to make decisions"},"119":{"dur":0,"text":"in the game."},"120":{"dur":3,"text":"And the talk is geared\ntowards the novice."},"123":{"dur":2,"text":"Certainly at the beginning, you\nmight be able to follow things."},"126":{"dur":3,"text":"But if you're a baseball fan\nor a sabermetrician yourself,"},"129":{"dur":2,"text":"maybe you'll appreciate\nthe current technology."},"132":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's been my privilege\nthrough the introduction"},"134":{"dur":4,"text":"you heard-- I've sort of made\nthis transition from a bench"},"139":{"dur":4,"text":"biochemist to a data scientist."},"144":{"dur":1,"text":"And I do lots of work with data."},"146":{"dur":5,"text":"And I'm an educator, so I spend\na lot of time teaching folks"},"151":{"dur":2,"text":"how to think about\ndata, how to use"},"154":{"dur":2,"text":"data to drive decision making,\nhow to think about modeling."},"156":{"dur":2,"text":"So all these things\nare part of what I do."},"159":{"dur":2,"text":"But I've really made\nthis conscious effort"},"161":{"dur":4,"text":"over my career to go\nfrom the bench biologist"},"166":{"dur":3,"text":"to the baseball scientist."},"169":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's been a lot\nof different phases."},"171":{"dur":1,"text":"A lot of it actually has\nto do with the physics"},"173":{"dur":1,"text":"and biology of baseball."},"175":{"dur":2,"text":"That actually was my entree\ninto the whole field,"},"177":{"dur":3,"text":"was doing anabolic\nsteroids in baseball,"},"180":{"dur":2,"text":"that kind of discussion\nand that kind of research,"},"182":{"dur":3,"text":"and talks since 2001."},"186":{"dur":4,"text":"But then it's transitioned into\nsabermetrics and analytics."},"190":{"dur":3,"text":"Quickly, this is a view\nof my seat at Fenway Park."},"194":{"dur":1,"text":"I get to score the games."},"195":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm in the press box."},"198":{"dur":2,"text":"This is another view when\nI'm looking down on the field"},"200":{"dur":1,"text":"from my seat."},"201":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is my score sheet."},"203":{"dur":2,"text":"I have a different score\nsheet than a lot of folks."},"205":{"dur":2,"text":"But it has to do\nwith the work I do,"},"207":{"dur":3,"text":"which is to record every\nevent for all the technology."},"210":{"dur":3,"text":"I record every pitch,\nevery play in a certain set"},"213":{"dur":2,"text":"of code and language."},"215":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's a very intense job."},"217":{"dur":1,"text":"I make the claim all\nthe time that I'm"},"219":{"dur":4,"text":"the only person in the pressbox\npaying attention to the game,"},"223":{"dur":3,"text":"because everyone else is\npaying attention to MLB"},"226":{"dur":2,"text":"At Bat, which is what\nmy data generates."},"228":{"dur":3,"text":"So I do all the paying\nattention these days at Fenway."},"231":{"dur":3,"text":"We generate the box\nscore at Fenway Park."},"235":{"dur":2,"text":"That's just an\nemergence of technology."},"237":{"dur":3,"text":"The old school version of\nthis was baseball box scores"},"241":{"dur":2,"text":"were written up by\nthe official scorer."},"243":{"dur":1,"text":"They don't do that anymore."},"244":{"dur":3,"text":"The official scorer just\ncalls the game itself."},"248":{"dur":4,"text":"So that's one nice\nrole I have, but it's"},"252":{"dur":3,"text":"transitioned to the\nacademic piece here"},"255":{"dur":1,"text":"of teaching sabermetrics."},"257":{"dur":3,"text":"And I designed the first\ncourse in sabermetrics,"},"260":{"dur":4,"text":"just doing baseball\nanalytics at Tufts in 2004."},"264":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we had this seminar\nof many years teaching"},"267":{"dur":1,"text":"Tufts students."},"269":{"dur":3,"text":"But now we've gone\ninto the MOOC format."},"272":{"dur":1,"text":"And one of the things\nwe did right away,"},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"in both formats,\neither seminar or MOOC,"},"276":{"dur":4,"text":"was talk about the definition\nof the term sabermetrics."},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"Sabermetrics has a funny origin."},"282":{"dur":1,"text":"Here's the origin."},"284":{"dur":2,"text":"The origin comes\nfrom SABR, which"},"286":{"dur":3,"text":"is the Society for\nAmerican Baseball Research,"},"289":{"dur":6,"text":"and metrics is just a word to\nsay how to measure baseball."},"295":{"dur":6,"text":"And so sabermetrics-- it's\nonly been a word since 1981."},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"But Voltaire was\nthe first person"},"304":{"dur":5,"text":"to do this-- those of you who\nare philosophers or readers."},"309":{"dur":2,"text":"Voltaire said first\ndefine your terms."},"311":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's really important."},"312":{"dur":1,"text":"When you look at\nthis definition,"},"314":{"dur":1,"text":"I'd say this is incorrect."},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"This is not what\nsabermetrics is."},"318":{"dur":4,"text":"Sabermetrics is not the\nstatistical analysis"},"322":{"dur":1,"text":"of baseball data."},"323":{"dur":3,"text":"That's way too\nnarrow a definition"},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"for what sabermetrics is."},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"And like a good\nscientist, I just"},"331":{"dur":4,"text":"want to show something and let\nyou see and think about this."},"336":{"dur":3,"text":"This is slow motion of\na pitcher for the Red"},"339":{"dur":1,"text":"Sox named Daniel Bard."},"340":{"dur":1,"text":"This is from 2010."},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"And I say Daniel Bard\nthe Good, because this"},"344":{"dur":3,"text":"was a year where Daniel Bard\nwas pitching extremely well."},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"For those of you who\nare baseball fans,"},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"you may remember Daniel\nBard a few years ago"},"352":{"dur":4,"text":"and how great a pitcher he was\nthat one season especially."},"357":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, if you pay attention to\nthese two slow motion videos,"},"360":{"dur":3,"text":"this is the same inning\nin the same game."},"363":{"dur":3,"text":"These are like\ntwo pitches apart."},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"A pitch count-- well,\nthree pitches apart."},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"You can see the pitch\ncount on the top screen."},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"The first on the left\nis the Derek Jeter."},"374":{"dur":1,"text":"It's at Yankee Stadium."},"376":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's a fastball."},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"And even though the physics--\nwe all know the physics"},"381":{"dur":3,"text":"say that the fastball\ncan't rise above gravity."},"385":{"dur":1,"text":"If you appreciate\nwhat's going on here,"},"387":{"dur":4,"text":"that fastball is defying gravity\nby having a back spin put"},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"on it by the pitcher going up."},"394":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, it's hard to\nappreciate, but just look"},"396":{"dur":4,"text":"how straight the\nleft-hand image is."},"400":{"dur":4,"text":"And then watch how much\ncurve the other pitch gets."},"404":{"dur":4,"text":"Just appreciate the\ncurve on the one pitch"},"409":{"dur":1,"text":"and the straightness\non the other."},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"So like any trained\nengineer scientist,"},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"you should be\nobserving this thing,"},"414":{"dur":3,"text":"and your natural curiosity\nwould drive questions."},"418":{"dur":0,"text":"What's going on here?"},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"These are two different pitches\nwith two different grips."},"421":{"dur":3,"text":"Both are thrown over\n98 miles an hour."},"425":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, baseball fans might\nknow what that means,"},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"but these are\nextremely fast pitches."},"428":{"dur":3,"text":"One is rising against gravity."},"432":{"dur":3,"text":"It's actually defying\ngravity and going up."},"435":{"dur":5,"text":"And the other is taking this\nleft to right turn so much so"},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"that the catcher\ncan't even catch it."},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"The point is this\nis just the time"},"447":{"dur":4,"text":"to observe and ask questions,\nlike any good investigation."},"452":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, this is when Daniel\nBard was quite good."},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"And he was getting people\nout left and right."},"458":{"dur":3,"text":"This pitch here to\nthe right was one"},"461":{"dur":3,"text":"of those-- we call them Bugs\nBunny pitches in baseball."},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"It references the old\n\"Bugs Bunny\" cartoon"},"466":{"dur":1,"text":"when you had crazy pitches."},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, this is real data."},"470":{"dur":6,"text":"So here is a field of pitches\nthat are yellow triangles."},"477":{"dur":4,"text":"You can sort of see them in\nhere behind the blue squares,"},"481":{"dur":1,"text":"which are the changeup."},"482":{"dur":3,"text":"But this pitch right here--\nthese two pitches way over here"},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"to the left side of\nthat screen where"},"488":{"dur":4,"text":"the pitch was that pitch that\nhad that big break-- what"},"492":{"dur":1,"text":"you're seeing here is data."},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"You're acting like\nthe catcher here."},"496":{"dur":4,"text":"And this is where all\nthe pitches move relative"},"500":{"dur":1,"text":"to the bullet spin."},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"The bullet spin is right in\nthe middle of the axis, right"},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"in the middle of the\ntwo big axes there."},"506":{"dur":1,"text":"That would be the bullet spin."},"507":{"dur":3,"text":"The ball is just going along\nits trajectory with gravity."},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"But then you add the\nspin that the pitcher"},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"can put on the ball, and you\nget different types of pitches."},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"So now, this is\nDaniel Bard the good."},"519":{"dur":4,"text":"This red cloud are his\nfastballs that rise."},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"The one you saw on the\nleft to Derek Jeter,"},"526":{"dur":1,"text":"that's the red cloud."},"528":{"dur":3,"text":"Then buried in there\nis the yellow cloud"},"532":{"dur":5,"text":"of triangles where he's\ngot that pitch that bends."},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, I'm going to show you--\nthis is when he's good."},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"This Daniel Bard the good,\nDaniel Bard the next year,"},"544":{"dur":2,"text":"and Daniel Bard the next year."},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"And pretty much after\nthis, he's out of baseball."},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll at least scroll back."},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"Daniel Bard the\ngood, Daniel Bard"},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"the next year, his last year."},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"He's tried since\nthen, but he's never"},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"made really any\nappearances since then"},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"in Major League Baseball."},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, if you follow the red\ncloud, you'll see what I mean."},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"This red cloud-- if\nyou can picture this,"},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"this is a catcher's orientation."},"570":{"dur":6,"text":"This red cloud is balls that are\nthrown by Daniel Bard that move"},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"a lot from that center point."},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"If you pick where\nthat red cloud is,"},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"the center of that\nred cloud, you"},"583":{"dur":5,"text":"can see it move as Daniel\nBard is going from good"},"588":{"dur":3,"text":"to mediocre-ish to not so good."},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"And then he's out of the game."},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"The point is this\nis datasets that we"},"596":{"dur":3,"text":"can use to analyze\npitching performance,"},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"the movement of the baseball."},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"So instead of just watching\nvideo and making assessments"},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"of how well balls move,\nwe can measure now"},"607":{"dur":3,"text":"how the balls actually\nmove based on the spin put"},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"on the ball by the pitcher."},"613":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is driving the\nanalytics in baseball."},"617":{"dur":1,"text":"The decision making\nin baseball can be"},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"based on this kind of data now."},"621":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, this is older data--\nolder data as in 2007 and '8"},"626":{"dur":1,"text":"is when this dataset emerges."},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's done by video."},"630":{"dur":3,"text":"Two video cameras are\ntrained between the area"},"634":{"dur":4,"text":"of the pitcher and the\ncatcher, and they basically"},"638":{"dur":4,"text":"do a triangulation of the\nball by video analytics,"},"643":{"dur":5,"text":"and then they reconfigure\nthe whole trajectory"},"649":{"dur":3,"text":"of the pitch, from the release\nall the way to the catcher,"},"652":{"dur":1,"text":"just using video analytics."},"653":{"dur":1,"text":"It's called PITCHf\/x."},"655":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, PITCHf\/x is\nreally, really important"},"657":{"dur":1,"text":"to baseball analytics."},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"We've actually moved on."},"661":{"dur":1,"text":"But let's go back."},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"We've just gone through a\nsimple little couple minutes"},"665":{"dur":4,"text":"exercise looking at Daniel Bard\nthe good, his actual video,"},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"some data showing how\nhis pitches might move,"},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"and how that might drive\nsome decision making."},"675":{"dur":3,"text":"An objective look at\nDaniel Bard's performance"},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"is what we can see with\nthis kind of dataset."},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"So this goes to the\ndefinition again."},"685":{"dur":2,"text":"Voltaire was the one who\nsaid first define your terms."},"688":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, sabermetrics to me--\nand I think most people"},"692":{"dur":3,"text":"who really are practitioners\nwould agree with this--"},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"it's the study of\nthe game of baseball"},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"through observation,\nby looking carefully."},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, sometimes you\ncan do experiments,"},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"but usually you don't."},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"It's more like\nastronomy that way."},"705":{"dur":1,"text":"You are observing\nthings and trying"},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"to figure out what's happening\nthrough your observations."},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"That's much more\nwhat sabermetrics is."},"712":{"dur":4,"text":"And here's the definition I\nstart off with all my courses."},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the simplified\nversion of sabermetrics--"},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"the scientific and\nobjective analysis"},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"of baseball-- much\nmore broadly defined"},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"than just looking at\nthe statistical analysis"},"726":{"dur":1,"text":"of baseball data."},"727":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is an important\npart to start."},"729":{"dur":4,"text":"Baseball can be treated as\nan observational science."},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"You can start thinking\nabout the game"},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"and understanding it better."},"739":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, what we've done\nat BU and at edx.org"},"743":{"dur":3,"text":"is develop our course\ncalled Sabermetrics 101:"},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"An Introduction to\nBaseball Analytics."},"749":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is one of\nthe big innovations"},"752":{"dur":1,"text":"we had in our course."},"754":{"dur":1,"text":"The course is very successful."},"755":{"dur":1,"text":"I could go on about\nall the data points"},"757":{"dur":4,"text":"of why EdX loves this course,\nand why BU loves this course,"},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"and why the students\nhave loved this course."},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"But one of the innovations\nI kept pushing for"},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"was something called\nthe SQL Sandbox."},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"One thing we do really well\nis teach SQL to novices."},"771":{"dur":1,"text":"And we do it through\nthe SQL Sandbox."},"773":{"dur":3,"text":"We make it very simple to\nplay with SQL right away."},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"And we really do it right\naway in this course."},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"We do it right away in my\ncourses in seminar format"},"783":{"dur":0,"text":"as well."},"784":{"dur":3,"text":"We take all comers, English\nmajors, non-technical people,"},"787":{"dur":5,"text":"and we start doing SQL\nqueries using the SQL Sandbox."},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"So it was an engineering\nthing to build this little SQL"},"795":{"dur":0,"text":"Sandbox."},"796":{"dur":1,"text":"It wasn't tricky,\nbut it really had"},"797":{"dur":1,"text":"to look right for the users."},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"That was one of the\nbig innovations we had"},"802":{"dur":4,"text":"in this MOOC in the EdX course."},"806":{"dur":3,"text":"This is a-- if you can see\nthis, this is a simple query,"},"810":{"dur":1,"text":"and you can see\nsome of the results."},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"You basically run a\nquery, and you get"},"814":{"dur":1,"text":"a bunch of results in a table."},"816":{"dur":3,"text":"And you can even push a button\nto download the full results."},"819":{"dur":2,"text":"In this case, this\nquery, I think,"},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"generated something\nlike 25,000 rows."},"824":{"dur":4,"text":"These are different\nsets of data for games"},"829":{"dur":2,"text":"between 2000 and 2009."},"831":{"dur":4,"text":"So this was one innovation\nthat we found worked very well"},"836":{"dur":1,"text":"for our students."},"837":{"dur":2,"text":"In addition, the thing\nwe innovated here"},"839":{"dur":1,"text":"was something called tracks."},"841":{"dur":2,"text":"We realized in Introduction\nto Data Analytics,"},"843":{"dur":2,"text":"we'd get some people who\nwere data scientists who"},"846":{"dur":1,"text":"were curious about baseball."},"847":{"dur":1,"text":"We'd get some baseball\npeople who were"},"849":{"dur":1,"text":"curious about data science."},"851":{"dur":3,"text":"And we'd get different folks\nwith different interests coming"},"854":{"dur":1,"text":"into this class."},"855":{"dur":3,"text":"So we created tracks--\ntracks of different topics."},"859":{"dur":1,"text":"We created a sabermetrics track."},"860":{"dur":2,"text":"It was a street baseball track."},"863":{"dur":1,"text":"We created a\ntechnical track, where"},"865":{"dur":2,"text":"we worked through SQL and\nR, but a lot of our students"},"867":{"dur":4,"text":"already had that done, like\nmaybe many in this room."},"871":{"dur":1,"text":"If they took this\ncourse, they actually"},"873":{"dur":3,"text":"wouldn't have to take\nthe technical track."},"877":{"dur":1,"text":"We also had a history track."},"878":{"dur":1,"text":"We also had a statistics track."},"880":{"dur":3,"text":"This didn't pretend\nto be Statistics 101,"},"883":{"dur":2,"text":"but it did cover the\nstatistics needed"},"885":{"dur":4,"text":"to do basic analytics that\nwe required for the course."},"890":{"dur":2,"text":"So the different tracks\nwas another innovation"},"892":{"dur":2,"text":"that actually many other\nintroductory courses on EdX"},"895":{"dur":1,"text":"have used since then."},"897":{"dur":3,"text":"So that was a nice\ninnovation we also had."},"900":{"dur":3,"text":"The last thing we had was\nsomething called the Grader."},"903":{"dur":5,"text":"We would take-- people would run\na SQL query for their problem"},"909":{"dur":3,"text":"set and submit the\ndataset as their answer."},"912":{"dur":1,"text":"And we had it in\na whole algorithm."},"913":{"dur":3,"text":"We developed an algorithm\nto try to grade each answer."},"917":{"dur":2,"text":"It involved the right\nnumber of columns, rows,"},"919":{"dur":2,"text":"the order of the\ncolumns and the rows,"},"921":{"dur":2,"text":"and different criteria\nto give different grades."},"924":{"dur":3,"text":"But the Grader was another\ninnovation for the class."},"927":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, in terms of baseball,\nreally, baseball--"},"931":{"dur":3,"text":"when we talk about sabermetrics,\nwe're modeling the game."},"935":{"dur":2,"text":"Just like modeling any\nsystem you want to model,"},"938":{"dur":2,"text":"you observe it carefully, and\nyou try to think about it."},"940":{"dur":2,"text":"So when you think\nabout baseball,"},"943":{"dur":2,"text":"you try to understand\nthe game's about winning,"},"945":{"dur":1,"text":"but how do you win the game."},"946":{"dur":2,"text":"You win the game with runs."},"949":{"dur":3,"text":"So essentially, when you talk\nabout baseball analytics,"},"953":{"dur":3,"text":"you're talking about\nanalyzing runs."},"956":{"dur":1,"text":"How are runs created?"},"958":{"dur":2,"text":"How are runs prevented?"},"960":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's the model."},"961":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's the key--\nthat's the standard"},"964":{"dur":4,"text":"you develop as you build all\nthese models for baseball."},"968":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, fundamentally, when\nyou think about runs--"},"971":{"dur":4,"text":"and baseball fans know this--\nyou think about great players."},"975":{"dur":1,"text":"And they're going\nto create runs."},"977":{"dur":2,"text":"David Ortiz is a\ngreat player, and he's"},"980":{"dur":2,"text":"got a great batting average\nand lots of home runs."},"983":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, very early on-- and I'm\ntalking a century ago-- very"},"986":{"dur":3,"text":"early on, people realized\nthe standard metrics"},"990":{"dur":4,"text":"for batting performance, batting\naverage, weren't working."},"994":{"dur":1,"text":"There was a problem\nwith batting average,"},"996":{"dur":3,"text":"and people recognized\nthis a long time ago."},"999":{"dur":4,"text":"This is a correlation\nbetween team runs"},"1004":{"dur":1,"text":"scored for a whole season."},"1005":{"dur":2,"text":"So you basically\ntake a team, you"},"1007":{"dur":3,"text":"measure their runs\nscored for that season,"},"1011":{"dur":2,"text":"and you correlate it with\nall their batting averages."},"1013":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, batting average\nwas the standard metric"},"1016":{"dur":3,"text":"for
