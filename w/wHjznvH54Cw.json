forever"},"45":{"dur":2,"text":"and among their treasures, perhaps the most significant,"},"47":{"dur":3,"text":"are the cuneiform inscriptions written on bits of clay"},"51":{"dur":1,"text":"which

all my life"},"218":{"dur":3,"text":"because I made this when I was about nine\nwhen I first got interested."},"222":{"dur":5,"text":"I copied a photograph of the original thing\nin a book as best I could."},"227":{"dur":3,"text":"Sawed this out without cutting off a finger,\nand painted all these things on the front"},"231":{"dur":4,"text":"to try to have a good working example of this board to experiment with"},"235":{"dur":2,"text":"and I have to say that I feel quite guilty\nnow when I think about it"},"238":{"dur":3,"text":"because I made my poor sister Angela play\nthis game endlessly with me"},"241":{"dur":1,"text":"to see if we could work out how the rules\nworked"},"243":{"dur":3,"text":"on the basis of the ones which people thought applied"},"246":{"dur":1,"text":"before we found the tablet in The British Museum"},"248":{"dur":2,"text":"which meant that we really knew how the game was played."},"251":{"dur":4,"text":"So, this goes back almost as long as I do\nand I'm

other"},"271":{"dur":2,"text":"parts of the world, and to put them altogether"},"274":{"dur":2,"text":"and I had this idea, when you write about things which"},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"are inert and dead, if you write about them"},"279":{"dur":3,"text":"when they're inert and dead then they remain inert and dead"},"282":{"dur":1,"text":"but if you imagine people playing

something where the whole history of the world"},"319":{"dur":1,"text":"seems to be summed up in it."},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"One piece of clay is full of words, it's full of"},"324":{"dur":2,"text":"grammatical problems, it's full of how to read it"},"326":{"dur":2,"text":"but when you've done this, when you've translated it"},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"when you've got
