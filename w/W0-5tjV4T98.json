before we start talking\nabout the refugee crisis,"},"38":{"dur":2,"text":"why don't you spend a\ncouple of minutes describing"},"40":{"dur":3,"text":"what your organizations do\nand what the goal of each"},"44":{"dur":1,"text":"of your organizations is?"},"46":{"dur":1,"text":"So I guess I'll start."},"48":{"dur":1,"text":"My name is Lara Finkbeiner."},"49":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm the deputy legal director\nat the International Refugee"},"52":{"dur":2,"text":"Assistance Project, or IRAP."},"54":{"dur":3,"text":"IRAP is an organization that\nprovides free legal

few countries."},"66":{"dur":1,"text":"You guys have all seen the news."},"68":{"dur":4,"text":"We're facing the largest\nrefugee crisis of modern time,"},"72":{"dur":3,"text":"and a lot of people\nare stuck in countries"},"75":{"dur":2,"text":"and still facing\nongoing persecution."},"78":{"dur":2,"text":"And because of that, they're\ngetting increasingly desperate"},"80":{"dur":1,"text":"and having to risk\ntheir lives by trying"},"82":{"dur":2,"text":"to get on boats to reach\nEurope or other places."},"85":{"dur":2,"text":"What we're trying to do\nis to provide each refugee"},"87":{"dur":4,"text":"a lawyer in order to represent\nthem in legal adjudications"},"92":{"dur":2,"text":"so they can have safe legal\npassage to countries

said,"},"100":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm the founder\nof Rainbow Street."},"101":{"dur":3,"text":"And we at Rainbow Street\nare focused specifically"},"105":{"dur":2,"text":"on housing needs and\nother essential resources"},"108":{"dur":5,"text":"for LGBT refugees in crisis\nsituations in the Middle East."},"113":{"dur":3,"text":"And so you can see us as the\nkind of front-line defenders"},"117":{"dur":4,"text":"against a lot of the very\nreal risks of bodily harm"},"121":{"dur":4,"text":"that refugees face, that LGBT\nspecifically refugees face,"},"125":{"dur":2,"text":"in countries like\nJordan and Lebanon"},"127":{"dur":2,"text":"and other places where\nit's particularly"},"130":{"dur":4,"text":"risky to be yourself as a queer\nperson or a transgender person."},"134":{"dur":1,"text":"ANDRES MUNOZ MEDINA:\nAnd now let's actually"},"135":{"dur":2,"text":"talk about the refugee crisis."},"138":{"dur":3,"text":"And just so that everybody\nis clear here, Lara,"},"141":{"dur":3,"text":"why don't you start by telling\nus what exactly constitutes"},"145":{"dur":1,"text":"a refugee?"},"146":{"dur":1,"text":"LARA FINKBEINER: Sure."},"148":{"dur":5,"text":"So a refugee is a person who\nis being individually targeted"},"153":{"dur":3,"text":"for reasons of race, religion,\nnationality, political opinion,"},"157":{"dur":2,"text":"or membership in a\nparticular social group--"},"159":{"dur":4,"text":"and that's where LGBT\nrefugees are included--"},"163":{"dur":2,"text":"and are forced to flee\ntheir country because"},"165":{"dur":3,"text":"of that persecution and seek\nsafety in another country."},"169":{"dur":2,"text":"And so right now in\nthe world today, there"},"172":{"dur":2,"text":"are over 65 million\npeople who have"},"174":{"dur":3,"text":"been displaced from their homes\nbecause of war or persecution."},"177":{"dur":3,"text":"And those people have sometimes\ncrossed an international border"},"181":{"dur":1,"text":"and gone to a neighboring\ncountry in order"},"183":{"dur":2,"text":"to seek safety, or\nsometimes they're"},"185":{"dur":1,"text":"just displaced within\ntheir own country."},"187":{"dur":4,"text":"And we call those people IDPs,\nor Internally Displaced People."},"192":{"dur":1,"text":"The vast majority\nof those individuals"},"193":{"dur":1,"text":"have no legal\nmechanism to then get"},"195":{"dur":1,"text":"to safety in a third\ncountry because we only"},"197":{"dur":1,"text":"have laws governing\npeople who have actually"},"199":{"dur":2,"text":"left their country and sought\nsafety in a neighboring"},"202":{"dur":1,"text":"country."},"203":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's sort of what the legal\ndefinition of a refugee is."},"207":{"dur":1,"text":"I think the thing\nto remember here"},"209":{"dur":4,"text":"is that the vast majority\nof these people--"},"213":{"dur":2,"text":"this is particularly\ntrue with LGBT people--"},"215":{"dur":2,"text":"when they're fleeing their\ncountry because of persecution"},"218":{"dur":2,"text":"and going to a neighboring\ncountry, a lot of times"},"220":{"dur":2,"text":"are facing the same persecution\nif not worse persecution"},"223":{"dur":1,"text":"in that second country."},"225":{"dur":1,"text":"ANDRES MUNOZ\nMEDINA: So let's try"},"226":{"dur":1,"text":"to put some numbers into this."},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"So you said 65 million refugees."},"230":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'm assuming\nthat most of them"},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"tried to come to some\nWestern countries, especially"},"236":{"dur":1,"text":"LGBT people."},"238":{"dur":4,"text":"How many of them do they\nactually get resettled?"},"243":{"dur":2,"text":"LARA FINKBEINER: One of the\ncommon misconceptions I think,"},"245":{"dur":3,"text":"that people think that\nrefugees eventually"},"248":{"dur":3,"text":"make it to safety in a country\nlike the United States."},"252":{"dur":3,"text":"In actuality, less\nthan 1% of all refugees"},"256":{"dur":3,"text":"will ever get the chance to\nget resettled to a safe third"},"259":{"dur":2,"text":"country, less than 1%."},"261":{"dur":2,"text":"ANDRES MUNOZ MEDINA: The\nchance to get resettled?"},"263":{"dur":0,"text":"LARA FINKBEINER: Right."},"264":{"dur":2,"text":"So even after they're\nreferred for resettlement,"},"267":{"dur":2,"text":"there's a legal adjudication\nthat takes place,"},"269":{"dur":2,"text":"and not all of those\nrefugees are accepted."},"272":{"dur":3,"text":"So the actual number is\neven smaller than that."},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, of all the people\nwatching this broadcast"},"277":{"dur":1,"text":"right now, if this room\nwas filled with people,"},"279":{"dur":1,"text":"maybe one person in\nthis entire group"},"281":{"dur":2,"text":"would actually get chosen and\nreferred for resettlement."},"284":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's an incredibly\nsmall number."},"286":{"dur":3,"text":"What IRAP is concerned\nabout is that those slots"},"290":{"dur":2,"text":"go to the most vulnerable people\ngiven that the number of slots"},"292":{"dur":3,"text":"are so low, and that\nthey have fairness"},"296":{"dur":1,"text":"and the adjudicative process."},"298":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that's what we focus on."},"300":{"dur":1,"text":"And just to follow up\non that, a lot of people"},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"ask me why is it\nsuch a small number,"},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"why aren't more refugees\ngetting resettled."},"307":{"dur":5,"text":"Refugees slots are basically\nallocated by country."},"312":{"dur":2,"text":"So every year, Western\ncountries come together"},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"and say we'll give 50,000\nslots for resettlement,"},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"we'll give 10,000\nslots for resettlement."},"319":{"dur":2,"text":"Those numbers are really a\ndrop in the bucket compared"},"321":{"dur":3,"text":"to the overall numbers of people\nwho are displaced in the world."},"324":{"dur":2,"text":"So what we're\nseeing increasingly,"},"327":{"dur":1,"text":"in particular with\nthe United States"},"328":{"dur":1,"text":"now, is those\nnumbers are actually"},"330":{"dur":1,"text":"getting smaller and\nsmaller at the same time"},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"that the crisis\nis growing, which"},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"is putting individual\nlives at risk."},"336":{"dur":1,"text":"And so that's sort\nof the situation"},"338":{"dur":1,"text":"that we're facing right now."},"339":{"dur":2,"text":"ANDRES MUNOZ MEDINA: Let me\ntry to focus a little bit more"},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"on the subject of\nLGBTQ+ refugees."},"345":{"dur":4,"text":"So 65 million, it's the\nnumber of total refugees."},"350":{"dur":1,"text":"What about LGBTQ+?"},"351":{"dur":3,"text":"How are they different from\nthe general population?"},"355":{"dur":6,"text":"You said some countries sort\nof try to make things fair."},"361":{"dur":5,"text":"Is being LGBTQ+ better for you\nbecause you are at more risk?"},"367":{"dur":4,"text":"Is it worse for you just\nbecause you were gay?"},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"LARA FINKBEINER: I'm answer\nthe legal side of that"},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"and then turn it over to\nyou for country conditions."},"376":{"dur":2,"text":"One thing that I think is\nreally important to say first"},"378":{"dur":3,"text":"and foremost when we're talking\nabout LGBT persecuted people"},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"is that there's a\ndistinction between people"},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"who make it to Western countries\nand are able to seek asylum."},"387":{"dur":1,"text":"We call those people\nasylum seekers."},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you actually make\nit to the United States,"},"391":{"dur":1,"text":"you have the right\nto apply for asylum"},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"and prove that you\nfaced persecution."},"396":{"dur":1,"text":"But to make it to\nthe United States,"},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"you have to have a visa\nthey go on an airplane."},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"And for most LGBT people in\nthe world, that's impossible"},"403":{"dur":3,"text":"because, to get a visa, you\nhave to show significant ties"},"406":{"dur":1,"text":"to your home country."},"408":{"dur":1,"text":"So you have to show\nthat you're married."},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"You have to show you have\nkids, a high-paying job,"},"412":{"dur":1,"text":"you own a house, you own a car."},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"These are all things that\nare unattainable to most"},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"LGBT people in the world."},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that's really\nan impossible task."},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"And so because of that, we\nhave this refugee resettlement"},"423":{"dur":2,"text":"scheme which is supposed to\ncomplement our domestic asylum"},"426":{"dur":3,"text":"scheme in allowing us to do\nadjudications of refugees"},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"who are still stuck overseas."},"432":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's just sort\nof the first hurdle."},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"LGBT people, when\nthey're being persecuted,"},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"they're not really able to\nget a visa and get on a plane."},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"So what they're able\nto do potentially"},"442":{"dur":3,"text":"is cross a border into\na neighboring country."},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"And I say potentially\nbecause there"},"447":{"dur":3,"text":"are a lot of folks who can't\ntravel safely internationally"},"450":{"dur":3,"text":"even if they're just crossing\na land border from, let's say,"},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"Lebanon to another country."},"456":{"dur":4,"text":"They can't go through\nany kind of checkpoint"},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"because, perhaps they're\ntrans and their gender"},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"marker on their\npassport doesn't match"},"466":{"dur":1,"text":"their physical presentation."},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's something that\ncould get them killed."},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"And so some people are\nactually literally stuck"},"472":{"dur":1,"text":"in their country."},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"And even if they make it\nto a neighboring country,"},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"if they make it to Jordan,\nif they make it to Lebanon"},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"and from, let's\nsay Iraq or Syria,"},"480":{"dur":1,"text":"they still face a\nhost of issues there."},"481":{"dur":0,"text":"KEVIN STEEN: Yeah."},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's kind of where\nRainbow Street comes"},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"in is, similar to\nIRAP, we are trying"},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"to focus on the most like\nvulnerable of the vulnerable"},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"cases for queer people and\ntrans people in these countries"},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"where it's really, really tough\nfor them to live, let alone"},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"possibly travel or seek refuge."},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we work\nprimarily with groups"},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"of local activists\nin Jordan and Lebanon"},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"and surrounding\ncountries that are"},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"focused on getting folks out\nof life-threatening situations."},"508":{"dur":3,"text":"Really often, we see individuals\nwho are facing persecution"},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"from their own family."},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"That's actually probably\nthe most prevalent concern"},"516":{"dur":1,"text":"that we have for\na lot of the folks"},"517":{"dur":3,"text":"that we're monitoring is\nthey may instantaneously"},"520":{"dur":3,"text":"enter a really life-threatening\nsituation if they are outed"},"524":{"dur":1,"text":"to someone in their family."},"525":{"dur":4,"text":"And in these places like\nJordan, for example,"},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"where there is a really\nprevalent social structure"},"533":{"dur":3,"text":"based on family ties, that\nreally complicates that."},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"And so if you're going\nto flee your family,"},"539":{"dur":1,"text":"it's not really a\nmatter of finding"},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"a different\nneighborhood to live in"},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"or even a different city on\nthe other side of the country."},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're fleeing your\nfamily because you're trans,"},"548":{"dur":3,"text":"it means there is\na network of people"},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"throughout the\ncountry, many of whom"},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"you may have never met before,\nwho are looking out for you."},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"And not in a good way, but I\nmean they're hunting you down."},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's the\nsituation that we've"},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"helped a lot of our\nrefugees get out"},"564":{"dur":3,"text":"of when they have opted to\nleave the country in emergency"},"567":{"dur":0,"text":"situations."},"568":{"dur":1,"text":"That actually happened\njust last week"},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"with a really young\ntransgender woman"},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"in Jordan who chose\nto flee to Lebanon,"},"574":{"dur":3,"text":"and IRAP and Rainbow Street\nworked together to get her out"},"577":{"dur":1,"text":"as quickly as possible."},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"I think, though,\nthat so often there"},"581":{"dur":4,"text":"is the misconception, not just\nby supporters of this work"},"585":{"dur":3,"text":"but also the beneficiaries of\nRainbow Street who are really"},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"in these crisis situations,\nthat as soon as they"},"591":{"dur":3,"text":"get to that second country that\ntheir situation is going to be"},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"a lot more secure or safe."},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"It's definitely better\nto be in a country"},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"where you're not being actively\nhunted down by your family,"},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"but folks who end up\nin a second country"},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"are exceptionally\nvulnerable because they have"},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"no support network whatsoever."},"611":{"dur":3,"text":"And so that's where we activate\nour resources as volunteers"},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"at Rainbow Street,\nas we're connected"},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"to a network of activists in all\nthese different countries who"},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"are trained with our\ncase intake protocol"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"to learn exactly what the\nneeds of these people are"},"625":{"dur":1,"text":"and mobilize to\nget them housing."},"627":{"dur":3,"text":"And so all of our\nassistance comes"},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"in the form of cash stipends\non a monthly basis that"},"633":{"dur":3,"text":"is designed to help people\nget the housing that they need"},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"and other services such\nas medical checkups."},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"Trans people in particular have\na whole lot of ongoing medical"},"641":{"dur":5,"text":"needs that cannot be ignored,\nand our activists also connect"},"647":{"dur":3,"text":"them not just to the funding,\nbut also to support networks"},"650":{"dur":3,"text":"to help them find the safe\nplaces in these countries"},"653":{"dur":0,"text":"to live."},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"You can't just live in\nany old neighborhood."},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that kind of\nholistic approach"},"660":{"dur":1,"text":"I think is really,\nreally necessary"},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"and really lacking\nright now in a lot"},"664":{"dur":4,"text":"of these under-resourced\ncountries for LGBT folks,"},"668":{"dur":4,"text":"where there just is a community\nbut it's pretty disjointed."},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we at Rainbow\nStreet are focused on"},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"of organizing that a\nlittle bit and channeling"},"677":{"dur":1,"text":"some of the funds\nfrom US donors,"},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"grassroots donors, who\nreally want to help"},"681":{"dur":1,"text":"and getting folks\noff the street out"},"683":{"dur":3,"text":"of that vulnerable situation\nso that they can access groups"},"686":{"dur":1,"text":"like IRAP."},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"If you're on the\nstreet, it's really hard"},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"to be able to make\nappointments and be"},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"able to keep those\nappointments if you"},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"don't have any money for\ntransportation, getting"},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"in a taxi."},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"With the kind of assistance\nthat our network provides,"},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"folks can access those\nresources that connect them"},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"to their long-term support."},"705":{"dur":1,"text":"ANDRES MUNOZ MEDINA:\nThat's great, Kevin."},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"You mentioned something\nabout local organizations"},"709":{"dur":4,"text":"that you work with,\nespecially in the Middle East."},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"Do you feel that--"},"716":{"dur":1,"text":"let me rephrase."},"718":{"dur":3,"text":"How do you think the\nlocal organizations are"},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"supporting the LGBT refugees?"},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"Are they trying\nto do a good job?"},"727":{"dur":1,"text":"Are there enough?"},"729":{"dur":1,"text":"Obviously, probably not enough."},"731":{"dur":1,"text":"KEVIN STEEN: Never enough."},"732":{"dur":1,"text":"KEVIN STEEN: There's\nnever enough."},"734":{"dur":1,"text":"Good question, though."},"735":{"dur":3,"text":"The truth is I definitely don't\nknow every single group that's"},"738":{"dur":0,"text":"out there."},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm constantly learning\nabout new groups that"},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"have some kind of\ninformal support strategy"},"743":{"dur":1,"text":"and figuring out\nwhat I can learn"},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"from them, what\ninformation I can possibly"},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"share with them from Rainbow\nStreet, kind of them connected"},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"with our support\nnetwork in a way that"},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"is secure for our volunteers."},"755":{"dur":1,"text":"Because you never\nknow who might be"},"757":{"dur":1,"text":"trying to get more\ninformation about them"},"759":{"dur":1,"text":"for malicious purposes."},"760":{"dur":1,"text":"But in general,\nthere's a lot more"},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"going on in the Middle East in\nterms of queer rights and trans"},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"rights."},"766":{"dur":3,"text":"Unfortunately, not a lot of it\ncan be focused on policy work."},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"In Lebanon, though,\nthere is a great group"},"772":{"dur":4,"text":"called Helem that is focused\nspecifically on policy."},"776":{"dur":2,"text":"There is a law in Lebanon--"},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't know if people\nare familiar-- that"},"782":{"dur":4,"text":"criminalizes same sex relations\nin really ambiguous terms."},"786":{"dur":1,"text":"And so there's like\na lot of legal space"},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"to be able to kind of\nreset that precedent."},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that's what Helem\nis working on right now."},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"They're the main legal advocacy\ngroup that I'm aware of."},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe you know more\non that regard, Lara?"},"798":{"dur":0,"text":"LARA FINKBEINER: No."},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, there are\nactors in this space,"},"802":{"dur":3,"text":"but I mean Helem's been in\nLebanon for a number of years"},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"now, and they're definitely\nat the forefront of this."},"808":{"dur":2,"text":"But in general,\nthere is not a lot"},"810":{"dur":1,"text":"of space for\nadvocacy work on this"},"812":{"dur":1,"text":"because it's just\nsimply too dangerous."},"814":{"dur":1,"text":"It's simply too\ndangerous, exactly."},"815":{"dur":3,"text":"And there's also the\nbarrier of simply not"},"819":{"dur":4,"text":"being able to literally\nregister legally as an entity."},"823":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, like in\nJordan for example,"},"825":{"dur":1,"text":"there is Rainbow Street."},"827":{"dur":3,"text":"We have like a group of a dozen\ncaseworkers who meet weekly."},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"We have office space."},"832":{"dur":2,"text":"But we're not legally\nregistered as an organization"},"834":{"dur":3,"text":"because that would be far too\ndangerous to flag ourselves"},"838":{"dur":1,"text":"to the local government."},"840":{"dur":1,"text":"And there are\nother organizations"},"841":{"dur":2,"text":"we work with, a media\norganization called"},"843":{"dur":2,"text":"\"MyKali Magazine,\"\nwho does awesome work."},"846":{"dur":1,"text":"They have this online magazine."},"847":{"dur":1,"text":"Everyone should check it out."},"848":{"dur":3,"text":"I think it's just like\nMy.Kali.com Maybe."},"852":{"dur":0,"text":"Search it."},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"They do a lot of features of\nqueer artists in the Middle"},"856":{"dur":0,"text":"East."},"857":{"dur":1,"text":"They publish in\nArabic and English."},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"They're really at the\nforefront of this."},"861":{"dur":1,"text":"And Rainbow Street\ngets a lot of referrals"},"862":{"dur":4,"text":"from folks who contact\nMyKali looking for support"},"866":{"dur":2,"text":"for themselves as a queer person\nwho may be facing persecution,"},"869":{"dur":2,"text":"or maybe just needs community."},"871":{"dur":3,"text":"There are also a lot of just\ninformal housing networks."},"875":{"dur":1,"text":"Especially within\nthe trans community"},"876":{"dur":2,"text":"we see a lot of trans women\nbanding together and being"},"879":{"dur":4,"text":"able to identify friends of\nfriends who are able to offer"},"883":{"dur":2,"text":"a room on a short-term basis."},"885":{"dur":2,"text":"And part of our work\nat Rainbow Street"},"888":{"dur":4,"text":"is really trying to\norganize that network"},"892":{"dur":2,"text":"in a way that does not\nincrease the amount of risk"},"895":{"dur":1,"text":"that people are in."},"897":{"dur":2,"text":"Because as you can\nimagine, the more you"},"899":{"dur":4,"text":"share with others about\nthese networks, the more risk"},"903":{"dur":3,"text":"you're in of being discovered\nby local authorities."},"907":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we are constantly\nmeeting new groups"},"910":{"dur":1,"text":"of just informal\nactivist networks"},"912":{"dur":3,"text":"who are working together to\nsecure housing and provide food"},"915":{"dur":2,"text":"for people and trying to really\nbring them into the folds"},"918":{"dur":1,"text":"and organize it as\nmuch as it needs"},"920":{"dur":3,"text":"to be organized in order
