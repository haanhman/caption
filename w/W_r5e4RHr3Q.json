context."},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"And one of the things"},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"that the government has\ndone in response to that,"},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"is introduce what we\ncall a welfare

thing"},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"that we have already\nlegislated to do,"},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"to actually make that\nhappen is, for example,"},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"that all working age\nbenefits

that's a bit\nof background,"},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"just to give you a sense\nof the fiscal context."},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'm going to move\non to talk a little bit"},"559":{"dur":1,"text":"about what's going on\nin the labour market,"},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"and some of the policies"},"562":{"dur":1,"text":"that we've been\nimplementing"},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"over recent years."},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"So, the starting\npoint actually,"},"568":{"dur":1,"text":"is quite an

going"},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"through the roof\nat the moment."},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"So although GDP\nhas been way down,"},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"employment is rising\nat a record

interesting is,"},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"the bottom line shows"},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"that unemployment got\nnowhere near as high"},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"as it did in the\nprevious two
