debate"},"30":{"dur":1,"text":"for House floor purposes."},"32":{"dur":1,"text":"It had to be over\n   the Common Core"},"33":{"dur":2,"text":"and the bill to withdraw\nfrom Common

session."},"46":{"dur":2,"text":"So really for almost two\n years this has been going on."},"48":{"dur":2,"text":"There's been a lot of\ndebate out in the public"},"50":{"dur":2,"text":"and the town

this."},"58":{"dur":2,"text":"And, you know, I\nalways knew once we got"},"61":{"dur":2,"text":"into this session, we would\n  have a professional hearing"},"63":{"dur":2,"text":"that would be held with\nrespect and dignity"},"65":{"dur":2,"text":"and was, about a\n   week ago, Monday."},"67":{"dur":2,"text":"Everybody, both sides,\n did a great job."},"70":{"dur":2,"text":"And it moved to the\n  floor this week."},"72":{"dur":2,"text":"And we held it for a little bit,"},"74":{"dur":1,"text":"we had to wait for\n some people to get in"},"76":{"dur":2,"text":"who wanted to weigh\n  in on the debate."},"78":{"dur":2,"text":"And had a debate\nyesterday, as you know,"},"81":{"dur":2,"text":"and it was quite spirited."},"86":{"dur":2,"text":"The part that we\n  had to separate out,"},"88":{"dur":2,"text":"especially in our committee,\n in the committee that I chair,"},"90":{"dur":1,"text":"we had to figure out\n  fact from fiction."},"92":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think both sides,\nthings get a little grey"},"94":{"dur":1,"text":"on each side, so we\nhad to figure that out."},"96":{"dur":1,"text":"And after we had\n   heard everything,"},"98":{"dur":2,"text":"we heard testimony, we\ndiscussed in a committee"},"100":{"dur":3,"text":"a couple days later, came\n   out with a 9-4 do not pass"},"103":{"dur":1,"text":"and then went up to the House."},"104":{"dur":2,"text":"And had quite a debate yesterday"},"106":{"dur":2,"text":"for about a hour and a\nhalf, two hours on that."},"109":{"dur":4,"text":"And, as you know, there\nwas some dramatics."},"113":{"dur":1,"text":"We had, what they call\n the minority report,"},"114":{"dur":1,"text":"which means three\n people in my committee"},"116":{"dur":1,"text":"did not agree with the\n   committee recommendation."},"118":{"dur":1,"text":"They agreed to have\n   their own separate report"},"120":{"dur":1,"text":"and have those amendments heard."},"121":{"dur":2,"text":"And in the

report"},"127":{"dur":2,"text":"and then just wanted\n  to take one section"},"129":{"dur":2,"text":"out of the eight\n sections in the bill."},"131":{"dur":2,"text":"So they were willing to forgo\n the other seven sections,"},"134":{"dur":1,"text":"but wanted to have the\n   debate on the one section,"},"135":{"dur":2,"text":"which was withdrawing\n North Dakota"},"137":{"dur":3,"text":"from the Smarter Balance\nconsortium, the testing."},"141":{"dur":2,"text":"So we debated that at\n length and then had"},"143":{"dur":1,"text":"some side debate\n  as far as standards"},"145":{"dur":1,"text":"and those sorts of things."},"146":{"dur":1,"text":"That amendment passed,\n that discussion,"},"148":{"dur":2,"text":"excuse me, that\ndiscussion, the motion,"},"151":{"dur":2,"text":"the Division A as\n they call it, failed."},"153":{"dur":2,"text":"And after that Division\nB was taken up,"},"156":{"dur":1,"text":"which was the\n remainder of the bill"},"157":{"dur":2,"text":"and that failed overwhelmingly."},"159":{"dur":2,"text":"I think it was 89-0 or 90-0."},"161":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'm sure Dave, that\ndoes not end the debate."},"164":{"dur":2,"text":"There will be plenty\n of debate between now."},"167":{"dur":1,"text":"But, you know, the\n  education community"},"168":{"dur":2,"text":"now has a couple\nyears to show us"},"170":{"dur":1,"text":"what the standards\n   are going to do."},"172":{"dur":2,"text":"And they have some time\nto prove to North Dakota"},"175":{"dur":1,"text":"this is what we're talking\n about and now we're expecting"},"177":{"dur":2,"text":"to see some results when we\n  come back here next sessIon."},"179":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's going to be interesting\nto see how that plays out."},"182":{"dur":3,"text":"- I notice you said it was\n  sometimes a little difficult"},"185":{"dur":3,"text":"for people to separate\n fact from fiction."},"188":{"dur":2,"text":"Is that a case that the\n   people who are supporting"},"191":{"dur":3,"text":"Common Core may need to do\n  a better job of selling it?"},"194":{"dur":1,"text":"- Actually I think both sides."},"195":{"dur":1,"text":"I think the communication\n   needs to improve"},"197":{"dur":1,"text":"on both sides of it."},"198":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think they need to\ntone down the rhetoric"},"200":{"dur":2,"text":"and I think people who\nare against Common Core"},"202":{"dur":2,"text":"I think they're\n objectives are noble."},"204":{"dur":4,"text":"I think the majority of\n  the people have a good idea"},"209":{"dur":1,"text":"of what they want."},"211":{"dur":1,"text":"But unfortunately\n like any other group,"},"212":{"dur":1,"text":"there's always that\n  little radical part"},"213":{"dur":2,"text":"that kind of overtakes\n what they want to do."},"216":{"dur":1,"text":"So yeah, I think\n communications on their side,"},"218":{"dur":1,"text":"on the education side too."},"219":{"dur":2,"text":"They need to better\n  communicate what they want,"},"222":{"dur":3,"text":"what we can expect from\nthem as North Dakotans"},"225":{"dur":2,"text":"and how it will\n  improve our system."},"227":{"dur":1,"text":"I think they're a little\nbehind on the ball net,"},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"they kind of caught up as\n   we got close to session."},"231":{"dur":2,"text":"But the word got out\n  from the schools,"},"233":{"dur":2,"text":"the vast majority of\n the teachers that they"},"235":{"dur":2,"text":"supported this and\n then the word got out"},"237":{"dur":1,"text":"as far as how well\n   things were doing."},"239":{"dur":1,"text":"We didn't hear that a\n year ago from schools."},"241":{"dur":2,"text":"They were kinda sitting\nback, laying in wait."},"243":{"dur":2,"text":"But as we got into session, we\n started hearing those stories"},"245":{"dur":2,"text":"and I think that definitely\n  added to the debate."},"247":{"dur":2,"text":"- What I heard today\nwas that there might be"},"250":{"dur":2,"text":"a study resolution, to\n study Smarter Balance"},"253":{"dur":1,"text":"for a couple years."},"254":{"dur":3,"text":"Let the Legislature and\n  the public weight in on it."},"257":{"dur":2,"text":"Is that in the plans or\nin the works somewhere?"},"260":{"dur":1,"text":"- To be honest with you Dave,"},"261":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't know right now."},"262":{"dur":1,"text":"I've heard some talk\n  of that but you know"},"264":{"dur":1,"text":"how those things go."},"265":{"dur":1,"text":"There's a lot of talk and a\n  lot of speculation up there."},"267":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, right now we got\n through the debate yesterday."},"270":{"dur":1,"text":"There was some talk\n  today on the floor"},"271":{"dur":1,"text":"that they might\n  bring the bill back."},"272":{"dur":1,"text":"And really quite frankly,\n   up until the time"},"274":{"dur":2,"text":"we gaveled in this\n  afternoon and they found out"},"277":{"dur":1,"text":"they did not have the votes\n  to bring the bill back."},"279":{"dur":2,"text":"So the bill's officially failed."},"282":{"dur":1,"text":"But as far as any\n   study resolution,"},"284":{"dur":2,"text":"those are something that\n   I'm sure will be discussed"},"286":{"dur":1,"text":"as we go forward."},"287":{"dur":1,"text":"And quite frankly, will probably"},"288":{"dur":1,"text":"be discussed during the interim."},"290":{"dur":1,"text":"- I kind of hesitate\n  to ask this,"},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"because one part of the\n  bill did interest me a lot."},"294":{"dur":3,"text":"It talked about what\n   looked like almost taking"},"297":{"dur":1,"text":"all of the authority\n  away from the"},"298":{"dur":1,"text":"Superintendent of\n  Public Instruction."},"300":{"dur":3,"text":"Is there some resentment\nor some anger toward"},"304":{"dur":1,"text":"the superintendent?"},"305":{"dur":1,"text":"- Well you know until they\n  pulled the division reports,"},"307":{"dur":1,"text":"that was going to be part\n   of my speech yesterday."},"308":{"dur":1,"text":"And I was going to ask you know,"},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"when did the discussion go\n   from standards and testing"},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"to the veering over to attacking"},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"the superintendent\n   position at DPI."},"318":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't know, to quite honestly,"},"319":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't why it went that way."},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"I know that was a reason\nwhy a lot of legislators"},"322":{"dur":1,"text":"did not support the bill."},"324":{"dur":3,"text":"They were very uncomfortable\n  with that part of the bill."},"327":{"dur":1,"text":"So to answer your question,\n  I really don't know why"},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"it veered into that."},"331":{"dur":1,"text":"I think, quite frankly,\nit hurt the debate."},"333":{"dur":3,"text":"I think it took the focus\n   off of what the people"},"336":{"dur":3,"text":"who do not like Common\n   Core wanted to talk about."},"340":{"dur":3,"text":"- Now let's get into,\n   probably the bigger issue,"},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"and probably one of the\n   biggest issues at session"},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's funding\n   for K12 schools."},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"Where is the legislature\nat right now,"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"given the fact of some\n of the uncertainties"},"353":{"dur":1,"text":"about oil revenue."},"354":{"dur":1,"text":"It doesn't directly\n  affect schools,"},"356":{"dur":1,"text":"but then again you've got\n   the property tax relief"},"357":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Mike] Yes.\n  - [Dave] that comes"},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"from education, so\n   where are we at?"},"360":{"dur":1,"text":"- Well, you know, the Senate"},"362":{"dur":1,"text":"has the K12 funding\n  bill right now."},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"And I know it's going through\n appropriations as we speak."},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"The K12 bill is around\n 1.8 billion dollars."},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's my belief\n  that we will always,"},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"and we will fund K12 to\n   the point that we need it"},"374":{"dur":1,"text":"to be funded."},"376":{"dur":1,"text":"Even if we have tough\n revenue picture,"},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"where we're looking at\n  revenue numbers coming down."},"379":{"dur":3,"text":"One of the departments\n we are not going touch"},"382":{"dur":1,"text":"will be K12, we will\n  always fund that"},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"because North Dakotans\n overwhelmingly support"},"386":{"dur":1,"text":"K12 in this state."},"387":{"dur":1,"text":"As you heard, I said\nyesterday on the floor,"},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"87% of North\n Dakotans support K12."},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"The highest rating in any\n  other state in the country."},"394":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's priority number one."},"395":{"dur":3,"text":"We always will have\n enough funding there."},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"In the interim, there\n was a recommendation"},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"of 3.6% growth in the\n   first year of the biennium"},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"and the second year\n  of the biennium."},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"The main reason is we're\nlooking at an additional"},"408":{"dur":3,"text":"8,000 to 13,000 new\n   students possibly joining"},"411":{"dur":1,"text":"the K12 ranks in North Dakota,"},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"which is a great\nproblem to have."},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"When I came in 2009, one\nof the things we heard"},"417":{"dur":1,"text":"was our schools\n   are emptying out,"},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"and the west needs\n   help out there"},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"and all these sorts of things."},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"Now here we are five,\n six years later,"},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"and now we have the challenge"},"426":{"dur":1,"text":"of what do we do\n  with these schools?"},"427":{"dur":1,"text":"They're burgeoning with kids"},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"and they have to add\nall this sort of stuff."},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"So the main increase in\n   K12 funding is the number"},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"of students coming."},"435":{"dur":1,"text":"Now one thing I don't think\n some people are thinking about"},"436":{"dur":1,"text":"is with the slowdown in the west"},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"and some of these people\n  moving back home down south,"},"441":{"dur":1,"text":"taking maybe their\n   family with them."},"442":{"dur":1,"text":"So that may slowdown\n  that increase."},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"But I think the increase\nin students statewide,"},"446":{"dur":1,"text":"you will see it keep jumping up."},"448":{"dur":1,"text":"But the Legislature\n  will always be there"},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"to adequately fund K12 and\n   we always have stepped up"},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"to the plate with that."},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"- You did talk\n  about that and that,"},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"it's almost kind of a\n moving target of about"},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"how many students\n   are going to be-"},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yes."},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"- in schools and with the\npotential slowdown in the west,"},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"well that adds some\nuncertainty to the whole thing."},"466":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yes, it will."},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"So as you know, the\nrevenue picture is fluid"},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"and we're going to get some\n  up-to-date numbers in March."},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think we'll\n  also find out maybe"},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"where some of the enrollment\n  trends are going to"},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"as we move forward\n   for next year."},"480":{"dur":1,"text":"We have a lot of\nchallenges when it comes"},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"to the money and to come to\n  funding programs right now."},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"- Now you weren't in\n  the session in 1982,"},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"- [Mike] No.\n - [Dave] or in the early 80s."},"489":{"dur":3,"text":"In 1982, the Governor Olson\n  had to do an allocation"},"493":{"dur":3,"text":"because of oil prices\n falling just below,"},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"I think $5 a barrel\n  at one point."},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"And he had to cut\n   across the board,"},"501":{"dur":1,"text":"that's all the power he had."},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"$45 million dollars was\ncut from elementary,"},"505":{"dur":1,"text":"secondary education."},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"Eventually that led to the"},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"Foundation Aids\n  Stabilization fund."},"511":{"dur":3,"text":"So your comments about\n funding K12 education"},"515":{"dur":2,"text":"as like a top\n priority do ring true."},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yes, and you know, the\n   Common Schools Trust Fund"},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"is growing by leaps and bounds."},"522":{"dur":3,"text":"I believe it's throwing off\n  $225, $230 million dollars."},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"That will help offset\n a lot of that growth"},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"and spending for K12."},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"And then the Foundation\nAids Stabilization Fund"},"532":{"dur":1,"text":"is also growing by\n   leaps and bounds."},"533":{"dur":1,"text":"So there are some\n   revenue streams"},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"that will help us fund K12\n   as we keep going forward."},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"And look forward to\nthe Legacy Fund debate,"},"540":{"dur":1,"text":"quite honestly, next session."},"541":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, what are we going\n  to do with some of that?"},"543":{"dur":1,"text":"And we have to have that\ndebate and figure out"},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"what we're going to do."},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"We're going to give that,\n   help with K12 students,"},"547":{"dur":1,"text":"help with higher ed students,\n those sorts of people."},"549":{"dur":1,"text":"And believe me, as you\n   know, there is no shortage"},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"of any ideas what to\n  do with that fund."},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"- But your Senate Majority\n   Leader Rich Wardner"},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"has said yes, the Legacy\nFund could be used"},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"to help fund K12 if needed."},"561":{"dur":0,"text":"- Correct, correct."},"562":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's always there."},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"So we'd have basically three\n  funding revenue sources"},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"to help keep that going."},"568":{"dur":1,"text":"And I cannot stress enough,"},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"K12 is one of the top\n priorities in the Legislature"},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"for both parties."},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"We have an obligation,\n according to the Constitution,"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"to provide an education for\n  every child in the state."},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"And we will do that, and we'll\n do it with proper funding."},"582":{"dur":1,"text":"- It's interesting\n   that North Dakota"},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"is in a very good position."},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"Yes, there is concern\n about oil revenues,"},"588":{"dur":4,"text":"but with the things that\nNorth Dakota has built,"},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"the Legislature has\n  built, K12 education"},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"is fairly protected."},"596":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, it's fairly\n  protected right now."},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, I know the\nlegislative bodies in the past,"},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"and even in the present, we\n  get criticized a little bit"},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"for putting to much money\n   in certain categories"},"605":{"dur":1,"text":"and kind of putting money aside."},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"But you see the fruits\n  right now of that happening"},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"from the previous legislators\n that went ahead and did this."},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"That is starting to\n  pay off right now"},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"and quite honestly\n   helping to ease"},"617":{"dur":1,"text":"that a little bit for us."},"619":{"dur":1,"text":"- What are some of the\n   other things that you see"},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"for funding priorities\n for education?"},"623":{"dur":1,"text":"Now there was a\n   lot of talk about"},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"pre-K and kindergarten\n education."},"626":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yes there's a early childhood\nbill over in the Senate"},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"right now."},"629":{"dur":4,"text":"It's a bill that would pay,\n  it would follow the child"},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"to the early childhood\n  school that they would use."},"637":{"dur":3,"text":"$1500 for that, it's $1000\n   for child, excuse me,"},"640":{"dur":1,"text":"$1500 for child who may be"},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"on free and reduced\n  meals program."},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"And that is not for, the\n   children are not required"},"647":{"dur":1,"text":"to go there, but\n  if the communities,"},"648":{"dur":1,"text":"the private sector\n get together and say,"},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"hey we need to have\nearly childhood program."},"653":{"dur":1,"text":"They can get together,\n develop a program"},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"and the state will then help\n  offset some of those costs"},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"and pay per child as they\n   go through that program."},"659":{"dur":3,"text":"And we noticed last session,"},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"quite a few of the districts\n  were using their own money"},"664":{"dur":2,"text":"for these sorts of programs."},"667":{"dur":1,"text":"We didn't know if\n  it was legal or not,"},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"so we did pass a bill\n into law last session"},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"to let the local school\n districts use their own money"},"674":{"dur":1,"text":"to pay for these early\n childhood programs."},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"And we saw the number of\ndistricts go up 50-60%,"},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"that took advantage of this."},"681":{"dur":1,"text":"We had an early childhood study"},"682":{"dur":1,"text":"that came back and said\nthere's a definite need"},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"in this state for it."},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"This bill is as a result\n   of that, as of that study."},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"I think it got great\n support in the Senate."},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that's also in the\nSenate appropriations right now."},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"It's going to get good\n   support in the House too."},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"- It's not to the level\n  some people wanted it to be."},"699":{"dur":1,"text":"- No, but like anything\nelse, you know,"},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"we need to start someplace"},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"and we can build it from there."},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"I think the bill's roughly,\n  $6 million dollars."},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"So we need to run this\n for, pass the bill"},"709":{"dur":1,"text":"run it for a biennium\n   and see how it's working."},"711":{"dur":1,"text":"We can tweak it, adjust\nit as we go along"},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"and decide next session\nwhat we want to do."},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"- Well your committee also\n   has some funding bills"},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"that have to go to House\nAppropriations, correct."},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yes, yes we do."},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a bill in there\nfor an enrollment bill,"},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"at a tune of $67\nmillion dollars."},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"And with the revenue\n   picture we have right now,"},"728":{"dur":1,"text":"that might be kind of tough."},"729":{"dur":1,"text":"But they're going to\n  be looking at that."},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"Another bill looking at\n helping some of the oil patch"},"734":{"dur":5,"text":"schools with their being able\n to pay for their school loans."},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"And helping with their oil\n  money that they're getting."},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a complicated formula,\n  but kind of tweaking"},"744":{"dur":1,"text":"some of those sorts of things."},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"We're looking at for some\n  more money for STEM courses"},"748":{"dur":1,"text":"and increasing that."},"750":{"dur":1,"text":"And that came out\n   of

so we have\n   a lot of programs"},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"that again, it's as a result\n  of the growth in students"},"766":{"dur":1,"text":"that we have and quite\nfrankly we need to

need to raise that\nbar for the students"},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"and challenge our kids more\n  than what they have today."},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"And also raise the\naccountability for the

supported"},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"Common Core, you had teachers,\n administrators, school boards"},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"- [Dave] and business-\n - [Mike] Yes."},"824":{"dur":1,"text":"- and others that\n supported Common Core."},"826":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yes, yes."},"827":{"dur":2,"text":"And again, I think\nit's early in the game."},"829":{"dur":2,"text":"My position has been, it's\n we're only

an\nannual increase from enrollment"},"855":{"dur":1,"text":"of even child."},"856":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's where the\n  policy debate is,"},"858":{"dur":2,"text":"do we do that or should\nthe

the bar is pretty low."},"873":{"dur":1,"text":"Last session, I think\n it was around 4%,"},"875":{"dur":1,"text":"so we lowered that bar\nto include more schools"},"877":{"dur":1,"text":"with rapid

there"},"884":{"dur":1,"text":"to help them get over that hump."},"886":{"dur":3,"text":"- Now I wanted to ask\n this question because,"},"889":{"dur":4,"text":"it's the interesting debate\nand not necessarily debate but,"},"894":{"dur":3,"text":"a lot of property tax relief\n is tied to education funding."},"897":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yes."},"899":{"dur":1,"text":"- And Representative\n Carlson

right in the middle of\n  that storm, quite honestly."},"925":{"dur":1,"text":"So it doesn't make me nervous,"},"926":{"dur":1,"text":"but it's a commitment\nthat we've made as

the state funding"},"937":{"dur":1,"text":"was around 45%,\nsomewhere in that area."},"938":{"dur":1,"text":"We were being criticized"},"940":{"dur":1,"text":"cause we didn't get\nenough money to schools."},"941":{"dur":2,"text":"Well here we are six years\n   later, and we're at 80%."},"944":{"dur":3,"text":"So again, schools is the\n  one area that we do control."},"948":{"dur":1,"text":"And again, we're obligated\n   by the Constitution"},"950":{"dur":1,"text":"to provide an education."},"951":{"dur":1,"text":"So we can control\n  that, when it comes"},"953":{"dur":1,"text":"to property

that get spent away"},"961":{"dur":1,"text":"and not really get passed along."},"963":{"dur":1,"text":"With the schools, with\n the K12 funding bill"},"964":{"dur":2,"text":"we tighten the\n screws, where we said,"},"967":{"dur":2,"text":"we lowered the mills\nand said here's the cap."},"969":{"dur":1,"text":"We're sending you the money"},"970":{"dur":1,"text":"and we fully expect\n you to pass it along."},"972":{"dur":1,"text":"And if they go above the cap,"},"974":{"dur":2,"text":"they have to take it to\nthe vote of the people."},"976":{"dur":3,"text":"And to the school's credit,\n they

when it came to property tax."},"1004":{"dur":3,"text":"- Now during the interim,\n   you had talked about"},"1008":{"dur":3,"text":"trying to find the true\ncost of what it takes"},"1011":{"dur":1,"text":"to educate a child."},"1012":{"dur":2,"text":"Have you come up\n with that number yet?"},"1015":{"dur":1,"text":"- Well I think that\nnumber's always

us one number,\n  and we in the legislature"},"1023":{"dur":2,"text":"well according to our\n   numbers it's this number."},"1025":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're trying\n   to work that out."},"1027":{"dur":1,"text":"There's a bill still\n  left in my committee"},"1028":{"dur":3,"text":"having to do with ending\n   fund balances for schools,"},"1032":{"dur":1,"text":"and it goes

with very large"},"1053":{"dur":1,"text":"ending fund balances,\n only turn around"},"1055":{"dur":2,"text":"and have very large\n  increases in their budgets."},"1058":{"dur":3,"text":"And then turn

trying to\n   shine some light on that."},"1072":{"dur":1,"text":"And that kind of ties in\nyour question as far as"},"1073":{"dur":1,"text":"what is the cost?"},"1075":{"dur":1,"text":"How much do they\n  really need to have"},"1076":{"dur":1,"text":"in ending fund balance?"},"1077":{"dur":2,"text":"We took a look at that,\n   there's still going to be"},"1080":{"dur":1,"text":"some more

you had your druthers,"},"1104":{"dur":2,"text":"what would be a target for\n   an ending fund balance?"},"1107":{"dur":2,"text":"- Well during the\ntestimony that we heard,"},"1110":{"dur":1,"text":"a lot of the larger\nschools around that 15%,"},"1112":{"dur":1,"text":"12 to 15% range."},"1114":{"dur":1,"text":"Some of the smaller\n  schools, you know,"},"1115":{"dur":2,"text":"15% doesn't equate\n  to that much money."},"1117":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think we're\n looking in the teens,"},"1120":{"dur":2,"text":"between 15 to 20%,\nsomewhere in that area."},"1122":{"dur":2,"text":"And those are things that\n   we're working right now."},"1124":{"dur":1,"text":"- Could that be tiered thing?"},"1126":{"dur":1,"text":"- You know we talked\n about a tiered thing."},"1128":{"dur":2,"text":"But there comes into\n question of equality."},"1130":{"dur":1,"text":"You have to be equitable\nacross the board."},"1132":{"dur":2,"text":"So probably not\n   the tiered system."},"1135":{"dur":1,"text":"We'll work off the\n  system we have now."},"1137":{"dur":1,"text":"It's just a matter of figuring\n out the dollar amounts"},"1138":{"dur":1,"text":"and the percentages\n  and to make sure"},"1140":{"dur":1,"text":"it works for everybody."},"1142":{"dur":2,"text":"- Now since we talked\n about K12 education"},"1144":{"dur":2,"text":"almost being, you're\n  going to fund it."},"1147":{"dur":1,"text":"- Because you've got the money"},"1148":{"dur":1,"text":"and we're going to fund it."},"1150":{"dur":2,"text":"Is there any thought,\nyou know have you talked"},"1152":{"dur":2,"text":"to your appropriators\n about contingencies?"},"1155":{"dur":1,"text":"- No we

we have one\n  hearing on Tuesday,"},"1191":{"dur":2,"text":"because the prime sponsor\n   had somebody coming in"},"1193":{"dur":1,"text":"couldn't make it\n   till next Tuesday."},"1194":{"dur":2,"text":"So we will be done,\n  my estimation, by\n  Tuesday afternoon."},"1197":{"dur":1,"text":"- Any big issues still -"},"1199":{"dur":1,"text":"- Not really, no."},"1200":{"dur":1,"text":"The ending fund\n  balance is the one."},"1201":{"dur":1,"text":"There was one for\n  parental directives,"},"1203":{"dur":3,"text":"whether their children would\n  have to take a test or not."},"1206":{"dur":2,"text":"We're working on that."},"1209":{"dur":1,"text":"Other than that, there's\nreally nothing else."},"1210":{"dur":1,"text":"So we've kind of moved\n all

something I have\n to do later on this afternoon"},"1224":{"dur":3,"text":"is step up in front of the\n full appropriations committee"},"1227":{"dur":2,"text":"and explain the education\n   bill's that have money it"},"1230":{"dur":1,"text":"and tell them why we passed it"},"1231":{"dur":1,"text":"and then explain\n   the bills to them."},"1233":{"dur":2,"text":"And as you know, that can be\n  quite an exercise sometimes."},"1235":{"dur":1,"text":"(both laugh)"},"1236":{"dur":1,"text":"- Well appropriators are\n   looking for every dollar,"},"1238":{"dur":3,"text":"every nickel and to make

think the last two\n  sessions, you know,"},"1248":{"dur":1,"text":"was kind of the gravy train."},"1249":{"dur":1,"text":"We didn't say no to a\n whole lot of things."},"1250":{"dur":2,"text":"This session we have\n  to learn to say no."},"1253":{"dur":2,"text":"I look at some legislators\n   who are much more"},"1255":{"dur":2,"text":"veteran than I, this\n  reminds them of some"},"1258":{"dur":1,"text":"of the years past."},"1259":{"dur":1,"text":"Saying you have to\n   be able to say no."},"1260":{"dur":3,"text":"And I've had the benefit,\n   at least my first session,"},"1264":{"dur":1,"text":"it was that way."},"1266":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's much tighter now and\n  the attitudes are changing."},"1269":{"dur":2,"text":"But I think as we see\n as the

on."},"1286":{"dur":2,"text":"- So let's, just for second,\n  talk about the parallels"},"1289":{"dur":3,"text":"you see between 09 and 15."},"1292":{"dur":1,"text":"- Well again, in 09\n  like I said earlier,"},"1293":{"dur":3,"text":"we heard schools\n   were emptying out."},"1297":{"dur":1,"text":"Out West needs\n economic development."},"1298":{"dur":3,"text":"We had people leaving\n the state

today it would\n   just seen like a pittance."},"1314":{"dur":2,"text":"But back then that\n was quite monumental."},"1316":{"dur":2,"text":"And he was thrilled\n  beyond

slow this down now"},"1329":{"dur":1,"text":"because we can't catch up."},"1330":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's one of those things,\n  watch out what you wish for."},"1332":{"dur":1,"text":"Because all of

honor quite honestly"},"1346":{"dur":1,"text":"to be on both ends\n   of that spectrum."},"1347":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's been, I've always\n   told my friends I said,"},"1350":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm a

we need to take a\n look at their projects"},"1379":{"dur":1,"text":"and what they need to do."},"1380":{"dur":1,"text":"But there's definitely\n the desire within
