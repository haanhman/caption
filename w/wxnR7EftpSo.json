the suit is arranged to match"},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"that photo which we have blown\nup large behind the suit."},"691":{"dur":5,"text":"So it's this really powerful\nway of using a real

that gets to be displayed and"},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"interpreted for people today."},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"Now the ring is an acquisition\nfrom a few years ago."},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"And we were

people?"},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"The ring is important\nbecause he took it off."},"743":{"dur":4,"text":"And he left it beside his wife's bed\nwhen he left that morning for work."},"748":{"dur":6,"text":"And a lot of people impute\nmotive to that action."},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"Different motives, but it's very powerful."},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"It's something that he never\nhad the chance to explain."},"761":{"dur":5,"text":"So it remains one of those questions that\nengages people's curiosity in the story."},"766":{"dur":3,"text":"So one of the things,\nas a museum person, you wonder is,"},"770":{"dur":4,"text":"should you find a way to put it on\na bedside table the way it was in 1963?"},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"Which ended up not being\nterribly feasible."},"778":{"dur":3,"text":"There weren't actually very thorough\ncrimes scene photos taken of the bedside"},"781":{"dur":0,"text":"table in 1963."},"782":{"dur":1,"text":"It wasn't seen as a

it."},"793":{"dur":3,"text":"So we ended up putting it in a case\non the sixth floor that sort of"},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"resembles one of the columns\nthat's already there."},"799":{"dur":1,"text":"It's an industrial building."},"800":{"dur":2,"text":"We have these big wooden columns and\nwe put in a column."},"803":{"dur":3,"text":"And this ring sort of seems to

concern,\na very primary concern,"},"817":{"dur":5,"text":"that Oswald not be seen as\nglorified in this exhibit."},"822":{"dur":4,"text":"So when you go to the sixth floor,\nOswald was, for a very long time,"},"826":{"dur":4,"text":"contained in one tiny\nlittle part of the exhibit."},"831":{"dur":1,"text":"And you didn't see him mentioned."},"832":{"dur":2,"text":"You didn't see his history

him in different parts of\nthe exhibit where it makes sense for"},"843":{"dur":3,"text":"mention of him or\nquestions about him to be raised."},"846":{"dur":3,"text":"But the ring has now\ncome to sort of represent"},"850":{"dur":4,"text":"the public's curiosity about Oswald and\nhis role."},"855":{"dur":3,"text":"And what that ring really\nmeant in the events of 1963."},"859":{"dur":1,"text":">> How did the museum get the ring?"},"860":{"dur":1,"text":"Did Marina Oswald, the Oswald family?"},"862":{"dur":5,"text":">> No, it was an acquisition several\nyears
