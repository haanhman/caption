to be here today."},"103":{"dur":3,"text":"- Now let's start with the\ntopic of category management."},"106":{"dur":2,"text":"The federal government has\nbeen making changes to its"},"109":{"dur":2,"text":"acquisition approach, so\nit has developed category"},"111":{"dur":1,"text":"management, can you tell me,"},"113":{"dur":2,"text":"what that is and where it came from?"},"116":{"dur":3,"text":"- Thanks, John, so\ncategory management is a"},"119":{"dur":2,"text":"review process and a management\nprocess that the private"},"122":{"dur":3,"text":"sector's been using to\nmanage how they buy goods"},"125":{"dur":2,"text":"and services for the past 20 years."},"128":{"dur":2,"text":"I think the best example\nfor it is to think about"},"130":{"dur":3,"text":"a grocery store, and that\nthe buying for produce,"},"134":{"dur":3,"text":"apples, oranges, bananas,\ngreens, is very different"},"138":{"dur":2,"text":"from how you want to\nbe buying your seafood"},"140":{"dur":3,"text":"or your meat, and so what\nhappens is that category managers"},"144":{"dur":2,"text":"are named to identify\nexpertise in those areas"},"147":{"dur":3,"text":"and really begin to think\nthrough what strategies,"},"150":{"dur":2,"text":"what does the market look\nlike, who are the suppliers,"},"153":{"dur":1,"text":"and how do we really effectively"},"155":{"dur":2,"text":"get the best deal for that?"},"157":{"dur":3,"text":"So translate that grocery\nstore into what the federal"},"160":{"dur":2,"text":"government does, and think\nabout it in terms of"},"163":{"dur":2,"text":"IT, facilities and construction."},"165":{"dur":2,"text":"In the categories of goods\nand services that you're"},"168":{"dur":2,"text":"purchasing to meet your mission needs,"},"170":{"dur":2,"text":"and think about that, and\nthen begin to translate"},"173":{"dur":2,"text":"in that into who are the suppliers,"},"175":{"dur":2,"text":"what best practices are there for"},"177":{"dur":1,"text":"buying in those categories?"},"179":{"dur":2,"text":"How do you know what the prices paid are?"},"181":{"dur":3,"text":"What's really the most\neffective way to think about"},"185":{"dur":3,"text":"how the government should\nact as a single entity,"},"188":{"dur":4,"text":"as opposed to decentralized\npurchasing for those categories."},"192":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think if you think\nabout it like that, John,"},"195":{"dur":3,"text":"it really begins to relate\nit back to the strength"},"198":{"dur":2,"text":"that we can do, that we can\nbring to category management"},"201":{"dur":2,"text":"to cross the government\nacquisition work force."},"204":{"dur":2,"text":"- So, why is the federal\ngovernment implementing"},"206":{"dur":1,"text":"category management now?"},"208":{"dur":1,"text":"What's the imperative?"},"209":{"dur":1,"text":"What's driving it?"},"210":{"dur":2,"text":"- So where we are is\nthat the government is"},"212":{"dur":1,"text":"decentralized its purchasing."},"214":{"dur":3,"text":"We have over 500 different\noffices making common"},"218":{"dur":2,"text":"purchases such as laptops and desktops."},"220":{"dur":2,"text":"If we take the laptop and desktop example,"},"223":{"dur":3,"text":"OFPP, Office of Federal\nProcurement policy put"},"226":{"dur":3,"text":"in a laptop desktop policy\nto reduce the number of"},"230":{"dur":3,"text":"contracts down to three\ncore contracts to be"},"233":{"dur":1,"text":"making those purchase."},"235":{"dur":2,"text":"But the reason they did\nthat is because upon review,"},"237":{"dur":2,"text":"they discovered over\n10,000 contracts across the"},"239":{"dur":3,"text":"government for buying\nthe laptops and desktops,"},"243":{"dur":2,"text":"which are basically a commodity-type item."},"245":{"dur":3,"text":"And so what we're doing\nis instead of effectively"},"249":{"dur":3,"text":"using our workforce,\nwe're decentralizing them"},"253":{"dur":3,"text":"and having them do the duplicative\nbuys over and over again."},"256":{"dur":2,"text":"Category management is\nan opportunity for us to"},"259":{"dur":3,"text":"look at it strategically,\nand see is there a better"},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"way that we could be buying\nsome of these common goods"},"264":{"dur":3,"text":"and services, and that way\nthe acquisition work force"},"267":{"dur":3,"text":"can really remain focused\non what the core mission"},"271":{"dur":3,"text":"and the unique needs of their\nagency and their services are."},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"- Laura, this sounds a lot\nlike strategic sourcing,"},"277":{"dur":3,"text":"which is another acquisition\nprocess I've learned about."},"281":{"dur":2,"text":"Is it the same, or how is it different?"},"284":{"dur":2,"text":"- So strategic sourcing is\na tool that could be used"},"286":{"dur":1,"text":"as part of category management."},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"But when you're thinking\nabout category management,"},"290":{"dur":2,"text":"think about, as I mentioned earlier,"},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"we have the 10 government-wide categories."},"295":{"dur":3,"text":"And that consists, I\nmentioned IT, professional"},"298":{"dur":2,"text":"services, facilities and construction,"},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"and so by looking at\nthe spend holistically,"},"303":{"dur":2,"text":"what we begin to understand\nis what agencies are"},"306":{"dur":2,"text":"spending the most amount of\nmoney in those categories."},"309":{"dur":3,"text":"Which agencies have the\nbest practices for being"},"312":{"dur":2,"text":"able to effectively buy and\naccomplish their missions"},"315":{"dur":3,"text":"in those categories, and\nwe can begin to collaborate"},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"and share information, and at that point,"},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"what we can identify is are\nthere strategic sourcing"},"323":{"dur":3,"text":"opportunities, or really\nshould we just be looking"},"326":{"dur":2,"text":"at demand management?"},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"One of the examples that I\nlove is that the Army Corp"},"332":{"dur":4,"text":"of Engineers has a demolition\ncenter of expertise."},"336":{"dur":4,"text":"Demolition is a specialized\ntype of expertise,"},"340":{"dur":4,"text":"sustainable practices,\nand green demolition is"},"344":{"dur":3,"text":"very important to being\nable to effectively do this."},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's a need that many agencies have."},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"When the facilities and\nconstruction category began"},"353":{"dur":2,"text":"working together, they\ndiscovered this expertise"},"355":{"dur":3,"text":"in the Army Corp of Engineers,\nand so what that team's"},"358":{"dur":3,"text":"now looking at is how do\nwe share that Army Corp"},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"of Expertise across all of the government?"},"365":{"dur":2,"text":"And what I've cited is only one example."},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"So begin to imagine what\nthe possibilities are,"},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"as we're looking across 280\nbillion dollars of common"},"373":{"dur":1,"text":"spend across the government."},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"For areas of expertise,\nbest practice sharing,"},"377":{"dur":4,"text":"using a single contract, or\na limited core of contracts,"},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"and how that can change\nour purchasing practices"},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"and how we engage with the marketplace."},"388":{"dur":2,"text":"- So, I'm sure that there\nhas been success using"},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"category management,\nwhat successes have you"},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"experienced so far?"},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"- I'd like to cite an\nexample out of the Federal"},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"Acquisitions Service, our\noffice of Fleet Management"},"399":{"dur":2,"text":"has been doing category\nmanagement for years."},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"And so what they've done\nis they've developed"},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"relationships with the big\nsuppliers of automobiles."},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"Understand how the market works,"},"410":{"dur":3,"text":"what the buying cycle is,\nwhat features the government"},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"needs, they work with both\nthe suppliers and they work"},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"with the customers to understand\nwhat the customers need."},"419":{"dur":3,"text":"And so they take that and\nthen they effectively go out,"},"422":{"dur":3,"text":"acquire the vehicles and sell\nthem as a shared service."},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"But by doing that they've\nalso been able to by being"},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"the single buying entity\nthey've also been able to"},"431":{"dur":3,"text":"knock 19% off of the list\nprice at a dealership,"},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"so what you have is really\nsomething that benefits"},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"the government because\nwe understand both the"},"440":{"dur":3,"text":"acquisition cycle and then\nwe're able to understand"},"443":{"dur":3,"text":"what are the standard\nmetrics for maintaining"},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"and keeping those vehicles on the road."},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"We also know at the end of that cycle,"},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"at the end of three years,\nis at the point in which"},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"we're able to get receive the most money"},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"for the sale of those vehicles."},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"So what you're thinking\nof is really the cradle"},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"to grave life cycle management,"},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's where we wanna\nbe with other categories."},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"So, the way that category\nmanagement works is"},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"Office of Federal Procurement Policy named"},"471":{"dur":3,"text":"the 10 government-wide category\nmanagers back in February."},"474":{"dur":3,"text":"And so what those category\nmanagers have been doing,"},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"so what we have, I keep\ntalking about facilities"},"480":{"dur":1,"text":"and construction professional services,"},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"but we also have categories\nfor office management,"},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"travel and lodging,\ntransportation and logistics,"},"487":{"dur":4,"text":"human capital, other medical core things"},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"and goods and services that\nthe government purchases."},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's been identified\ncategory managers for each"},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"of those 10 categories."},"498":{"dur":3,"text":"And what those category\nmanagers have done is as I've"},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"mentioned earlier, they\nidentified the top spending"},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"agencies in that category."},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"They've begun to pull\nthose agencies together,"},"510":{"dur":3,"text":"and what they've also done\nis develop pull the data"},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"together to really look at\nwhere the money is being spent"},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"in that category, where\nare there opportunities"},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"to improve how we purchase?"},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"And they've developed a\ncategory management plan."},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"So you really start out\nby developing that plan"},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"and in order to develop\nthat plan you have to do"},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"the data analysis, the supplier analysis,"},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"understand the best\npractices, and understand what"},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"the government's already doing."},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"That comes together in\na plan that's approved"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"by the category management\nleadership council"},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"with a series of initiatives\nthat are looking at"},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"how do we improve that category."},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"An improvement of the\ncategory means things such as"},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"increase or maintain\nthe small business spend"},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"for that category."},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"Reduce the number of contracts,\nlook for opportunities"},"555":{"dur":3,"text":"for savings, and each\ncategory's being tracked"},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"against that set of metrics,"},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"so then the initiatives\nare being exercised."},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"And so those initiatives might,"},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"are unique to each category"},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"and they're are things such\nas identifying the best"},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"in class contracts."},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"Which contracts are collecting\nthe transactional data,"},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"were built collaboratively\nacross the government,"},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"and what will really be\nthe most effective tool"},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"for the government to be\nable to achieve its needs?"},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"And then we manage it, but\nwhat I mean by manage it"},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"is we track the performance,\nwe do the performance"},"588":{"dur":4,"text":"monitoring, all of those\nactivities that allow us to"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"see are we making a difference\nby identifying the best"},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"in class contracts by having\npeople use the Acquisition"},"598":{"dur":3,"text":"Gateway, are we seeing fewer\ncontracts being awarded"},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"and moved to enterprise contracting?"},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"So when you look at all of\nthat, that's the category"},"607":{"dur":1,"text":"management life cycle."},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"Office of Federal Procurement\nPolicy's taking the lead"},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"in managing and organizing that."},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"And GSA is supporting them."},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"- Great, well with a name\nlike category management,"},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"you obviously have categories."},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"What are the categories,\nhow many are there,"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"and where did they come from?"},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"- So let me run through them."},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"We have the information\ntechnology category,"},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"professional services,\nsecurity and protection,"},"632":{"dur":3,"text":"facilities and construction,\nindustrial products"},"636":{"dur":3,"text":"and services, then we\ngo to office management,"},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"travel and lodging,\ntransportation and logistics,"},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"human capital and medical."},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"So the way that those were developed is"},"647":{"dur":3,"text":"there was also nine\ndefense centric categories."},"650":{"dur":3,"text":"So, but the way that the 19\ncategories were developed"},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"was really looking at a\ncut of all of the spending"},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"out of the federal\nprocurement data system."},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"And it was broken down into\ncommon product service codes"},"663":{"dur":4,"text":"and those codes were aligned\nto create the 10 category,"},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"to create the 10 common\ncategories which comprise"},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"about 280 billion of the spend."},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"And that was done in\npartnership with Department of"},"676":{"dur":3,"text":"Homeland Security, Department\nof Defense, and GSA"},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"to really make sure that\nthis taxonomy made sense."},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"And so when I talk about the categories,"},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"that's the structure."},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"Part of the category manager's\nresponsibility though"},"689":{"dur":3,"text":"now that we're operational,\nis to also assess"},"692":{"dur":3,"text":"are there some adjustments\nneeded in order for these"},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"categories to make more\nsense to the acquisition,"},"698":{"dur":3,"text":"to the way that we actually\nacquire goods and services."},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"- Okay, can you give us\na few real life examples"},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"of category management in practice?"},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"- Let me go back to the\nlaptop desktop initiative"},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"that I cited earlier."},"711":{"dur":3,"text":"So, Office of Federal\nProcurement Policy recognized"},"715":{"dur":3,"text":"that laptops and desktops\nare commodity type items"},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"and so what they asked is\nfor a group of agencies"},"721":{"dur":3,"text":"to begin to collaborate and\ndevelop common specifications."},"725":{"dur":3,"text":"So what we're doing is developing\nthat common requirement."},"728":{"dur":4,"text":"And that was then taken\nand formed into the laptop"},"732":{"dur":4,"text":"desktop memo, with the\nrequest that with requirement"},"736":{"dur":3,"text":"that agencies begin to\nbuy, civilian agencies,"},"740":{"dur":3,"text":"begin to buy from either\nNIH NITAAC contract,"},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"NASA SEWP, or GSA's schedule 70."},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"And that they buy the\nstandard specifications."},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"So the reason for this is\nthat will allow the government"},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"to be buying both\nstandardized equipment across"},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"the board, and it begins\nto tell the supplier market"},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"this is what the government\nwants and we're building"},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"common requirements brings down the price."},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"So immediately afterwards,\nwe began seeing price"},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"reductions up to 50%\nin some of these items."},"771":{"dur":4,"text":"So, that's a very detailed\nand specific example"},"776":{"dur":1,"text":"of how category management works,"},"777":{"dur":3,"text":"and what's happening today in the world."},"781":{"dur":1,"text":"As I mentioned earlier,"},"782":{"dur":1,"text":"it came out of the commercial world."},"784":{"dur":2,"text":"So, the commercial\nworld, this is something"},"786":{"dur":1,"text":"that IBM, Johnson and Johnson,"},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"and other key fortune 500 companies"},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"have implemented with great success,"},"792":{"dur":3,"text":"and that they consider key\nto their market success."},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"In terms of the public\nsector, we have meeting,"},"798":{"dur":2,"text":"we have regular meetings\nwith the United Kingdom"},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"and with the Canadian\ngovernment who are both deeply"},"803":{"dur":1,"text":"interested in category management."},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"The United Kingdom has been doing\nit for the past 10 years."},"808":{"dur":2,"text":"And the Canadians are beginning\nto move in that direction,"},"811":{"dur":3,"text":"as well, so what we're trying\nto, what we're looking to"},"814":{"dur":3,"text":"determine is how can we\ncollaborate across governments"},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"as well in order to share\nthe best practices of"},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"category management."},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"- So how will we know when\nwe've seen category management"},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"success, how do you\nquantify, or measure it,"},"828":{"dur":1,"text":"and then report it?"},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"- That's a really important question."},"832":{"dur":2,"text":"So category management\ninitiatives to date have already"},"835":{"dur":3,"text":"saved two billion dollars\nfor the American tax payer."},"838":{"dur":2,"text":"And we're tracking that,\nas I mentioned earlier"},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"one of the metrics that\neach of the category teams"},"843":{"dur":3,"text":"is tracking is what type\nof savings both real"},"846":{"dur":2,"text":"and administrative\nsavings are being achieved"},"848":{"dur":2,"text":"by the category management initiatives."},"850":{"dur":3,"text":"Also, the small business\nmetrics are very important one."},"854":{"dur":3,"text":"How do we understand the\nsmall business community"},"857":{"dur":3,"text":"so that we can increase\ntheir participation in each"},"860":{"dur":2,"text":"of these categories by better\nunderstanding the marketplace"},"862":{"dur":3,"text":"and how the small businesses\ncan contribute to the"},"866":{"dur":1,"text":"government's success."},"868":{"dur":2,"text":"- So how is category\nmanagement supposed to benefit"},"871":{"dur":1,"text":"the acquisition workforce?"},"872":{"dur":2,"text":"What's in it for them?"},"875":{"dur":2,"text":"- Category management, so if\nwe think about category"},"877":{"dur":3,"text":"management, I like to think\nabout it at three layers."},"881":{"dur":2,"text":"So I've talked about the\ncategory manager in the strategic"},"883":{"dur":3,"text":"role that the category manager\nand the team are playing."},"887":{"dur":3,"text":"Then the agency also has\nan opportunity to use"},"890":{"dur":2,"text":"category management to\nunderstand how their spending"},"893":{"dur":3,"text":"and how they're buying within\nspecific categories."},"896":{"dur":2,"text":"And then finally the\nacquisition workforce is where"},"898":{"dur":3,"text":"the rubber hits the road,\nso the decision's made"},"902":{"dur":3,"text":"by both the contracting officers,\ncontracting specialists,"},"905":{"dur":2,"text":"and the program people\nare what really drive the"},"908":{"dur":2,"text":"change that can be achieved\nby category management."},"911":{"dur":2,"text":"And the connection needs\nto be made from those"},"913":{"dur":3,"text":"category strategies, down to\nthe workforce and how they're"},"917":{"dur":1,"text":"going to be implementing them."},"919":{"dur":1,"text":"And what that really means\nis the workforce is going to"},"921":{"dur":3,"text":"see increased knowledge of best practices"},"924":{"dur":1,"text":"for a specific categories,"},"926":{"dur":3,"text":"better information about what\nthe best in class contracts"},"929":{"dur":3,"text":"are for the category,\nlooking at prices paid data"},"933":{"dur":2,"text":"as we begin to collect\ntransactional data so you can"},"935":{"dur":3,"text":"compare pricing more easily\nand understand the pricing"},"939":{"dur":3,"text":"structure, see statements\nof work that represent best"},"942":{"dur":3,"text":"practice, and begin to\nalso be able to see how"},"946":{"dur":3,"text":"do you buy within a specific\ncategory to effectively"},"949":{"dur":2,"text":"achieve the goals that\nyou want to achieve."},"952":{"dur":2,"text":"- Well let's talk more about new solutions"},"955":{"dur":1,"text":"and how the federal\ngovernment can move towards"},"957":{"dur":1,"text":"category management."},"958":{"dur":3,"text":"Are you at GSA institutionalizing\nthe principles of"},"962":{"dur":2,"text":"category management, and if so, how?"},"965":{"dur":2,"text":"- We are, so we're doing,\nthe key thing that we're"},"967":{"dur":1,"text":"doing is supporting\nboth the government-wide"},"969":{"dur":2,"text":"category management initiative\nthat I've been speaking"},"971":{"dur":3,"text":"about, and developing and organizing"},"974":{"dur":1,"text":"the Acquisition Gateway."},"976":{"dur":3,"text":"You'll hear in a moment\nfor Andrea Azarcon Heller"},"979":{"dur":2,"text":"more about the Acquisition Gateway,"},"981":{"dur":2,"text":"but what that is is a tool\nthat effectively takes"},"984":{"dur":1,"text":"all of that information\nthat I just talked about"},"986":{"dur":2,"text":"that benefits the acquisition workforce,"},"988":{"dur":3,"text":"and gives, provides the\nplatform in order for you"},"991":{"dur":2,"text":"to be able to access it, so\nyou can see those statements"},"994":{"dur":1,"text":"of work, you can see the pricing."},"996":{"dur":3,"text":"And that all the information\nis available for use"},"999":{"dur":3,"text":"to make your acquisitions more effective."},"1002":{"dur":2,"text":"- Well, what could an\nacquisition professional find"},"1005":{"dur":2,"text":"on the Acquisition Gateway?"},"1007":{"dur":3,"text":"- So the Acquisition Gateway\nalso includes a project"},"1011":{"dur":3,"text":"center that allows you\nto store your information"},"1014":{"dur":3,"text":"and begin

years back, we did\na survey of the acquisition"},"1128":{"dur":3,"text":"community and we found not\nso much that they wanted"},"1131":{"dur":4,"text":"another tool to do their\nprocurement on a

really cares\nabout doing things right,"},"1432":{"dur":2,"text":"so compliance is super important to her,"},"1434":{"dur":4,"text":"so her task at hand is\nthat she has to do an

I'm gonna add a project,\nand I am going to call this"},"1475":{"dur":3,"text":"IT Cloud Services, and she needs it soon,"},"1481":{"dur":4,"text":"so let's say she needs\nit by the end of July,"},"1485":{"dur":2,"text":"and we'll make this a Friday."},"1488":{"dur":2,"text":"And she can put whatever\nin the description or notes"},"1490":{"dur":3,"text":"but for the sake of the\ndemo, I'm gonna put test"},"1493":{"dur":2,"text":"and test, and I'm going to hit save."},"1495":{"dur":1,"text":"And so there's Janet's project."},"1497":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I'm gonna open it up."},"1500":{"dur":2,"text":"You can see some other\nthings that Laura has listed"},"1502":{"dur":4,"text":"in here, and I'm going to\nadd a task to her project."},"1506":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's say she needs to\nhave market research done,"},"1509":{"dur":4,"text":"and the Gateway's a really\ngreat tool for market research."},"1514":{"dur":2,"text":"And she would like to have\nthat done sooner

we're gonna go back to the homepage,"},"1579":{"dur":2,"text":"and the next thing that we're going to do"},"1582":{"dur":2,"text":"is go into the solutions finder."},"1584":{"dur":3,"text":"And you can see that the\nsolutions finder already knows"},"1587":{"dur":2,"text":"what agency you work\nfor based on your login"},"1590":{"dur":3,"text":"because your OMB MAX account is\nlinked to your PIV

since Janet is buying\nIT for this case study,"},"1625":{"dur":3,"text":"let's click on what is\navailable in the IT category,"},"1629":{"dur":1,"text":"and you can see that there are 81

itself."},"1703":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're gonna go back into the Gateway."},"1705":{"dur":1,"text":"And the next thing that\nwe're going to look at is"},"1707":{"dur":4,"text":"eBuy Open and this

needs\ninfrastructure as a service."},"1727":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're gonna type in IAAS"},"1730":{"dur":4,"text":"and out of the 190 thousand\nplus RFQ's in the system"},"1734":{"dur":2,"text":"that whittles down to 16."},"1738":{"dur":2,"text":"So let's actually take\na look at one of these"},"1741":{"dur":2,"text":"and see what was bought."},"1746":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can see here

here."},"1799":{"dur":3,"text":"So you can see some of\nthose here on the left,"},"1802":{"dur":3,"text":"so a lot of product stuff, advantage, OS2,"},"1806":{"dur":2,"text":"as an example, print

built?"},"2755":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm assuming that's more\nfrom a content perspective"},"2758":{"dur":3,"text":"as opposed to platform, but\nhow would you tackle that one?"},"2761":{"dur":3,"text":"-
