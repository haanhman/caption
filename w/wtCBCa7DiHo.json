X."},"16":{"dur":1,"text":"Which was a little bit unusual,"},"18":{"dur":2,"text":"and then maybe we can go back a little bit"},"20":{"dur":1,"text":"and unpack"},"21":{"dur":1,"text":"how something like that happened."},"24":{"dur":3,"text":"So we have these audacious goals awards."},"27":{"dur":1,"text":"Once a quarter, we get together,"},"29":{"dur":2,"text":"and everyone presents how they're doing,"},"32":{"dur":1,"text":"and there's a trophy."},"34":{"dur":1,"text":"The trophy hasn't been given out"},"36":{"dur":2,"text":"in a year now,"},"38":{"dur":1,"text":"'cause it's really hard to

very unusually, three different teams"},"65":{"dur":2,"text":"potentially merited that trophy."},"70":{"dur":1,"text":"Usually it's nobody,"},"71":{"dur":1,"text":"that's why we haven't given it out in a year."},"73":{"dur":1,"text":"So the star chamber,"},"75":{"dur":2,"text":"which was my and my admin Sergio."},"77":{"dur":2,"text":"Went and huddled and decided who"},"80":{"dur":1,"text":"actually deserved it,"},"81":{"dur":1,"text":"picked the one of the three teams"},"83":{"dur":1,"text":"that we thought actually had been the"},"84":{"dur":1,"text":"most audacious of the three that had"},"86":{"dur":1,"text":"potentially earned it,"},"88":{"dur":1,"text":"and then awarded them the trophy"},"90":{"dur":1,"text":"at the end of the all

then he said,"},"105":{"dur":2,"text":"but I don't think that we're going good enough,"},"107":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't think we've been audacious enough,"},"109":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm handing it back to you."},"113":{"dur":1,"text":"It's like we can't give the award away,"},"115":{"dur":1,"text":"it's been a year since anybody got it."},"119":{"dur":2,"text":"And this was with many many hundreds

want to take a step back now,"},"131":{"dur":2,"text":"and tell you the thing that excites me the most,"},"133":{"dur":1,"text":"this is some of the stuff"},"135":{"dur":2,"text":"that I couldn't get into the TED talk"},"137":{"dur":3,"text":"which I gave recently Vancouver that's up online now,"},"141":{"dur":2,"text":"but that in some way because it was a TED talk,"},"144":{"dur":2,"text":"has

most"},"167":{"dur":2,"text":"is trying to systematize innovation."},"172":{"dur":1,"text":"And when I was young,"},"174":{"dur":1,"text":"I used to think that systematizing innovation"},"175":{"dur":2,"text":"might be some combination of things"},"178":{"dur":1,"text":"you could get if you just went"},"179":{"dur":1,"text":"to all the business books and you picked out"},"181":{"dur":1,"text":"the smartest things from each of"},"183":{"dur":1,"text":"the business books."},"184":{"dur":1,"text":"Hire the smartest people,"},"185":{"dur":1,"text":"and fail fast and this and that"},"187":{"dur":1,"text":"and the other thing."},"188":{"dur":2,"text":"It's kind of true,"},"190":{"dur":1,"text":"it just turns out that if you do that,"},"192":{"dur":2,"text":"you don't actually get much innovation."},"197":{"dur":1,"text":"What excites me is,"},"199":{"dur":1,"text":"what would it take to actually get"},"200":{"dur":2,"text":"a group of people to do the things"},"203":{"dur":2,"text":"that it says in those business books"},"206":{"dur":1,"text":"that you guys have all read."},"209":{"dur":3,"text":"If this is the set of things they should do,"},"212":{"dur":3,"text":"and this is the set of things they do do,"},"216":{"dur":2,"text":"and for any of you who've been in business before,"},"219":{"dur":1,"text":"you know how big"},"220":{"dur":1,"text":"a gulf there is."},"221":{"dur":1,"text":"Wherever you worked,"},"222":{"dur":2,"text":"I promise you that gulf existed."},"225":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a reason that there's such a big gap"},"227":{"dur":4,"text":"between the things that you want them to do,"},"232":{"dur":2,"text":"and the things they actually spend their time doing."},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"It's because this is the lip service that you're giving,"},"237":{"dur":3,"text":"but this is this paths of least resistance,"},"242":{"dur":2,"text":"emotionally, to doing those things."},"245":{"dur":3,"text":"They don't care what you said they should do,"},"249":{"dur":2,"text":"they're going to follow the paths of emotional"},"251":{"dur":1,"text":"least resistance."},"253":{"dur":3,"text":"Cultural engineering is the process of trying"},"256":{"dur":3,"text":"to get this, the paths of least resistance,"},"260":{"dur":1,"text":"to actually line up with the things you want"},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"them to do."},"264":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm gonna give you a few examples."},"266":{"dur":2,"text":"So and the first one is,"},"269":{"dur":1,"text":"let me unpack a little bit more about"},"271":{"dur":1,"text":"the audacious goals."},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"So here's how most companies"},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"do something sort of like the audacious goals."},"278":{"dur":1,"text":"Have you guys heard of OKRs?"},"280":{"dur":1,"text":"Objectives and key results?"},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is the way objectives and key results"},"284":{"dur":2,"text":"actually works in a business."},"287":{"dur":1,"text":"You,"},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"you report to me,"},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"and you're gonna have to held accountable by me."},"293":{"dur":1,"text":"'Cause I'm the manager."},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're gonna start this weird haggle situation."},"298":{"dur":2,"text":"We're gonna figure out what your OKRs are,"},"301":{"dur":1,"text":"you're gonna try to haggle them as low"},"303":{"dur":3,"text":"as you can, sand bag sand bag sand bag."},"306":{"dur":1,"text":"'Cause you know I'm gonna hold you accountable"},"308":{"dur":2,"text":"for whatever it is that we decide on."},"310":{"dur":1,"text":"So then I can feel you pulling down,"},"312":{"dur":1,"text":"so I'm gonna pull up up up up."},"314":{"dur":1,"text":"I want to haggle haggle haggle,"},"315":{"dur":1,"text":"you can do more you can do more,"},"317":{"dur":1,"text":"you're sand bagging."},"318":{"dur":1,"text":"And we end up in this place in the middle"},"320":{"dur":1,"text":"where you feel like you don't really own"},"321":{"dur":1,"text":"that OKR,"},"323":{"dur":1,"text":"it's higher than the things that you were saying,"},"325":{"dur":1,"text":"and you were making all these arguments about why"},"326":{"dur":2,"text":"that's an unreasonable number, or metric"},"328":{"dur":1,"text":"for me to hold you to."},"330":{"dur":1,"text":"It's either the wrong metric"},"331":{"dur":1,"text":"or it's too big relative to what"},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"you think you can actually accomplish."},"335":{"dur":1,"text":"And I feel bad too,"},"336":{"dur":1,"text":"because I feel like it's two thirds or half"},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"of what I actually was trying to talk you into."},"341":{"dur":1,"text":"So now we have this thing that neither of us"},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"believes in, and this is the OKR."},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"This is a stick, it's a weapon."},"348":{"dur":1,"text":"And my management plan for the entire"},"350":{"dur":1,"text":"quarter or year,"},"351":{"dur":1,"text":"is I'm going to beat you"},"353":{"dur":2,"text":"with the OKR stick."},"356":{"dur":0,"text":"You're not doing it enough,"},"357":{"dur":1,"text":"you're not doing it enough."},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"This is 21st century management somehow."},"362":{"dur":1,"text":"It doesn't work very well."},"365":{"dur":1,"text":"This is not how to get people to be innovative."},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"You cannot get them to do the things"},"370":{"dur":1,"text":"you really want them to do,"},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"especially if your lip service includes things"},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"like creativity and failing fast,"},"376":{"dur":2,"text":"and being trasnparent, and a lot of emotionally"},"379":{"dur":1,"text":"hard things,"},"380":{"dur":1,"text":"while you're beating them with the OKR stick."},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"Crazy idea, what if instead,"},"386":{"dur":3,"text":"you just got to pick what you were gonna do?"},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's call it your audacious goal"},"392":{"dur":1,"text":"for the quarter."},"394":{"dur":0,"text":"It's your goal,"},"395":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not gonna haggle with you about it,"},"396":{"dur":1,"text":"you pick it."},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"You get up in front of all of us,"},"400":{"dur":1,"text":"once a quarter, and say"},"402":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm gonna try to get this thing"},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"done and I know that I'm almost certain"},"406":{"dur":1,"text":"not to get it done,"},"407":{"dur":1,"text":"but I'm proud of the fact"},"409":{"dur":1,"text":"that I'm going to try to"},"410":{"dur":3,"text":"do something that sounds so crazy hard,"},"414":{"dur":1,"text":"so unlikely."},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"The goal is to have it be something that you can"},"417":{"dur":1,"text":"accomplish,"},"418":{"dur":1,"text":"about 1\/10th of the time."},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"If you're positive you're not gonna accomplish it,"},"422":{"dur":1,"text":"that's not very interesting,"},"423":{"dur":1,"text":"you're not really gonna try."},"426":{"dur":1,"text":"if you're confident you're gonna do it,"},"428":{"dur":1,"text":"it's not audacious, by definition."},"430":{"dur":1,"text":"So you want it to be in that sort of"},"431":{"dur":1,"text":"10% range."},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"And you're going to end up getting"},"435":{"dur":1,"text":"held accountable by yourself,"},"437":{"dur":1,"text":"'cause you picked it,"},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"and by the whole community,"},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"because you want everyone to be proud of you."},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"Now I can be your coach and mentor,"},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"instead of having to beat you with the OKR stick."},"448":{"dur":3,"text":"So at X we have audacious goals."},"451":{"dur":3,"text":"And every quarter, every team gets up and says"},"454":{"dur":3,"text":"here is what our audacious goal for the quarter"},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"was, here's how we did against it."},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"And here's what we're gonna try to do for the next"},"463":{"dur":1,"text":"quarter."},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"And some teams don't do it some quarters,"},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's actually okay too."},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"They don't look as audacious when they don't do it,"},"471":{"dur":1,"text":"but that's fair game,"},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"because you need to be crisp"},"474":{"dur":1,"text":"about what you're gonna do if you're"},"476":{"dur":1,"text":"gonna try to do it."},"478":{"dur":1,"text":"So now think in that context."},"479":{"dur":4,"text":"That after a year of not handing this out,"},"483":{"dur":1,"text":"we offered someone the trophy,"},"485":{"dur":1,"text":"and they said no thank you."},"487":{"dur":1,"text":"We're not being audacious enough."},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"Somehow, they've internalized something really"},"492":{"dur":1,"text":"deep and meaningful."},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"They were actually one upping me"},"495":{"dur":3,"text":"on the things I'm trying to get X"},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"to be like."},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"That's when the magic starts happening."},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"When the flywheel is speeding itself up"},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"and so you don't have to keep speeding it up."},"509":{"dur":1,"text":"That's great corporate culture."},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"That's what you want to unlock."},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"In any organization that you're a part of,"},"515":{"dur":2,"text":"or that you're overseeing."},"517":{"dur":1,"text":"How did that happen?"},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"Let me give you two or three other examples,"},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"of the kinds of things that might have lead to"},"523":{"dur":4,"text":"this person Grant saying no thank you"},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"and handing the trophy back to me."},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"So one of them is fail fast,"},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"lean start up."},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"Predotyping,"},"537":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't know which one of these things"},"538":{"dur":0,"text":"you've heard recently."},"539":{"dur":1,"text":"They're all fine, they're all true."},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"It's that"},"543":{"dur":1,"text":"saying it doesn't make it happen."},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm gonna tell you something else that we do."},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"And afterwards it will sound"},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"kind of shocking and yet basic."},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"I encourage you to find"},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"anywhere else that has actually done this."},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"When one of our projects"},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"that actually has a non trivial number of people,"},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"at least a few people full time on it."},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"Ends their project,"},"569":{"dur":1,"text":"and they end their projects,"},"570":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll tell you a story about that."},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"We bring them upon stage,"},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"we have a bunch of Xers here,"},"576":{"dur":1,"text":"you've seen this multiple times."},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"We bring them up on stage,"},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"and we say this team"},"582":{"dur":1,"text":"is ending their project today."},"584":{"dur":3,"text":"They have done more in ending their project,"},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"in this quarter, than any of you"},"590":{"dur":3,"text":"did to further innovation at X in the last quarter."},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"And then all of you the first time you hear"},"595":{"dur":1,"text":"this are gonna feel a little ripped off."},"597":{"dur":1,"text":"Like wait a second,"},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"they're failing, they're calling it a day."},"602":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm working my ass off,"},"604":{"dur":1,"text":"how come they're up on stage,"},"606":{"dur":1,"text":"that seems kind of unfair."},"608":{"dur":1,"text":"Then I say,"},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"and we're giving them bonuses."},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"You say wait I'm not getting a bonus,"},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"why are they getting a bonus?"},"617":{"dur":1,"text":"They're killing their project,"},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm actually succeeding, mine's still going."},"621":{"dur":1,"text":"You know what guys?"},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"Take a vacation, and when you come back,"},"626":{"dur":1,"text":"the world's your oyster."},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"You'll find some new project to start,"},"629":{"dur":1,"text":"or you can pick which project"},"630":{"dur":1,"text":"to jump into,"},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"depending on which one's going best."},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"At this point all of you"},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"are a little mystified"},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"if this is your first time through this,"},"638":{"dur":1,"text":"and feeling quite ripped off."},"640":{"dur":3,"text":"But social norms are incredibly powerful."},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"People will do horrible horrible things"},"646":{"dur":1,"text":"to each other if you set the social norms"},"648":{"dur":1,"text":"appropriately,"},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"they will also do incredibly innovative,"},"651":{"dur":3,"text":"creative, expressive transparent things"},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"if you create the right norms for it."},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"By the 10th time that we do this,"},"660":{"dur":1,"text":"it's normal."},"662":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't even have to remind people anymore"},"663":{"dur":1,"text":"when we stand them up,"},"664":{"dur":1,"text":"that they should get a huge round of applause."},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"And that everyone there should be looking up"},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"to the people who ended their projects."},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"But have you ever heard of somebody actually getting"},"674":{"dur":1,"text":"rewarded?"},"676":{"dur":1,"text":"'Cause if I tell you to fail fast,"},"678":{"dur":1,"text":"are you gonna run out,"},"680":{"dur":1,"text":"if you're part of our organization"},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"and fail fast just 'cause I said it?"},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"No, you're gonna be thinking"},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"what happens if I fail fast?"},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"Am I gonna get fired?"},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm gonna lose all the people reporting to me"},"693":{"dur":0,"text":"right?"},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"So then I suck and then I'll go tell"},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"my friends I was kinda demoted."},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"Am I gonna get my bonus at the end of the year?"},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"What happens to my compensation"},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"or my opportunity for promotion?"},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"Are those things all out the window?"},"708":{"dur":1,"text":"This is the difference between"},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"the lip service and the actual emotional"},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"paths of least resistance."},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"Creating the feeling"},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"that failing fast would actually"},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"get you what you want instead of getting"},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"you the opposite of what you want."},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"So here's a story for how one of these teams"},"729":{"dur":4,"text":"got up on stage in the first place."},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"I was sitting with"},"738":{"dur":1,"text":"maybe 30 of them,"},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"we'd been working for about two months."},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"Their general manager for this project"},"745":{"dur":1,"text":"hadn't been working out great,"},"747":{"dur":1,"text":"eventually we had to move that person"},"748":{"dur":1,"text":"out of the organization."},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"I had become the temporary general manager,"},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"I already could kind of smell where things were going"},"755":{"dur":2,"text":"but I didn't want to prejudge,"},"757":{"dur":2,"text":"I said look, we are gonna decide"},"759":{"dur":1,"text":"whether this is going to the moon"},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"or whether we're gonna call it a day."},"763":{"dur":1,"text":"You guys need to come to me"},"764":{"dur":1,"text":"with that decision,"},"766":{"dur":1,"text":"and they were having a hard time doing that,"},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"and they were working on kind of some business planning"},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"and technical planning,"},"770":{"dur":2,"text":"and sort of restructuring their thinking."},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"And eventually, they got me a dock,"},"776":{"dur":1,"text":"it was seriously that thick."},"778":{"dur":2,"text":"30 people in the room,"},"781":{"dur":1,"text":"we all sat down."},"782":{"dur":1,"text":"I think they thought I had pre read the doc,"},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"I really hadn't even cracked it."},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"And I said all right who's with me?"},"788":{"dur":1,"text":"We're all gonna spend the next eighteen"},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"years of our lives if that's what it takes"},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"to cause this to change the world."},"796":{"dur":1,"text":"Eighteen hours a day if that's what it takes."},"798":{"dur":1,"text":"We will quit X, all of us,"},"800":{"dur":1,"text":"and go do this,"},"801":{"dur":1,"text":"who's with me?"},"804":{"dur":1,"text":"No one's hand went up."},"806":{"dur":1,"text":"And I just waited,"},"808":{"dur":2,"text":"I hadn't looked at the business plan."},"811":{"dur":1,"text":"I just kept waiting."},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe a good 30 seconds, a minute"},"815":{"dur":1,"text":"which was very long when you're all just sitting"},"816":{"dur":1,"text":"there"},"818":{"dur":1,"text":"and I'm the only one with my hand up."},"819":{"dur":1,"text":"I said sounds like you guys need to talk amongst"},"821":{"dur":1,"text":"yourselves a little bit."},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"I went away, they called me about three hours later"},"825":{"dur":1,"text":"and said okay come back."},"826":{"dur":2,"text":"And I came back, and they said"},"829":{"dur":1,"text":"yeah you're right."},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"I said we should leave."},"833":{"dur":2,"text":"And they said it's good but it's not great,"},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"we don't really think it's that great a business."},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"Awesome, that wasn't so bad."},"843":{"dur":1,"text":"Dee sitting right there was in the room"},"845":{"dur":0,"text":"for that,"},"846":{"dur":2,"text":"and was part of the shepherd of helping"},"848":{"dur":2,"text":"them during the three hours when I wasn't there."},"851":{"dur":2,"text":"Come to that conclusion,"},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"but they said it to me."},"856":{"dur":1,"text":"When I say it to them,"},"857":{"dur":1,"text":"they've been fired,"},"859":{"dur":1,"text":"they've been demoted,"},"860":{"dur":2,"text":"their project has been ruined."},"864":{"dur":1,"text":"'Cause they have no ownership"},"865":{"dur":1,"text":"of that moment."},"867":{"dur":1,"text":"But when they say,"},"868":{"dur":1,"text":"yeah you're right."},"870":{"dur":2,"text":"They're taking ownership of their own time"},"873":{"dur":1,"text":"of their own lives,"},"875":{"dur":3,"text":"which believe me is the only really precious thing."},"878":{"dur":1,"text":"When you're pretty good but not great project"},"880":{"dur":3,"text":"is over, you're not just gonna go sit in the corner"},"883":{"dur":1,"text":"and do nothing afterwards,"},"885":{"dur":1,"text":"you're gonna get onto something that's"},"886":{"dur":1,"text":"better than that."},"888":{"dur":1,"text":"Almost by definition if that was a good"},"889":{"dur":1,"text":"but not great project."},"892":{"dur":1,"text":"And that they owned that,"},"894":{"dur":1,"text":"then they didn't feel like it was being"},"895":{"dur":2,"text":"wrest away from them,"},"898":{"dur":1,"text":"and then they got stood up in front"},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"of X and
