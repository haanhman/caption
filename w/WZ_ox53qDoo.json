about 22%."},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, you might look at that and\nsay, well, that's not too"},"593":{"dur":1,"text":"bad as a batting average."},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"It's hard to predict the

because"},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"the company wasn't able\nto sustain itself."},"653":{"dur":4,"text":"So the consequences when a\ncompany takes a flyer on one"},"657":{"dur":3,"text":"of these

question you want to ask,\nthen, is why is it that"},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"we get these predictions\nwrong so often?"},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is another observation\nthat I've gotten"},"673":{"dur":4,"text":"into after watching companies\nin the Valley and in"},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"technology in general for\na long time is that most"},"680":{"dur":3,"text":"companies tend

or"},"708":{"dur":1,"text":"not it's possible."},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"Analytical companies are kind\nof the opposite extreme."},"712":{"dur":3,"text":"What they do is they tend to\ntry to use careful market"},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"research, other sorts of\nanalysis, to figure out"},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"exactly what the future is going\nto look like, almost"},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"like a weather report."},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"And then you just plan for the\nfuture weather that you're"},"724":{"dur":1,"text":"expecting to have happen."},"726":{"dur":1,"text":"So examples of these two\ntypes of companies."},"727":{"dur":1,"text":"The one that people always\ntalk about for visionary"},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"companies is Apple\nunder Steve Jobs."},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"Visionary leader, decided what\nwas going to happen, everybody"},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"It didn't matter if\nyou objected."},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"You could go work\nsomeplace else."},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"And they were just going to go\nimplement on that stuff."},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"I think Amazon, you can make a\nvery good argument that they"},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"tend to operate much the same\nway when they place some of"},"747":{"dur":1,"text":"the big bets that they make."},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"But there are others that\nhaven't been as successful."},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"I spent about six years at Palm\nand PalmSource, and that"},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"was a visionary leader led\ncompany that kind of ran out"},"757":{"dur":2,"text":"of vision over time and got into\nsome serious problems."},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'll talk about the types of\nproblems you can get there."},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"You also get a lot of companies\nthat sound wonderful"},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"at the time, and they actually\ntend to enter our mythology of"},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"great companies that people\nget nostalgic about, but"},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"they're financial disasters."},"771":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's stuff like DeLorean--\nyou

that we're going\nto do this is things called"},"1264":{"dur":2,"text":"wireless application\nprotocol, or WAP."},"1267":{"dur":1,"text":"And it looked a little\nlike this."},"1268":{"dur":1,"text":"And I guess that screen\nis too small for you"},"1270":{"dur":0,"text":"to be able to see."},"1271":{"dur":3,"text":"So what you've got here is a\nlittle tiny phone--

off."},"1332":{"dur":2,"text":"They were based on the\nPDAs of the time."},"1334":{"dur":2,"text":"So it was not about bringing\nin web stuff."},"1336":{"dur":1,"text":"In fact, WAP was not\neven

that's where the industry\nwas really focused."},"1374":{"dur":5,"text":"At the same time, in a secret\nhideout in Ontario, Canada"},"1379":{"dur":2,"text":"there was a company called\nResearch In
