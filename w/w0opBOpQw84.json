here,"},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"where he started his vlogs."},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"Adding that schedule to the mix has just"},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"made his channel absolutely take off."},"524":{"dur":3,"text":"He'd earned 500,000 subscribers\nbefore he started vlogging,"},"528":{"dur":3,"text":"and he'd done that through\nalways having high quality

up"},"538":{"dur":3,"text":"and now instead of just\ntelling a new story"},"541":{"dur":0,"text":"whenever he finds one,"},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"he's actively searching\nfor one every single day."},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm afraid that just"},"547":{"dur":1,"text":"because you start daily vlogging tomorrow,"},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"you're probably not going to hit his pace."},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"He put in that groundwork for 4.5 years"},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"before he started daily vlogging,"},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"so he had all that practice already there."},"557":{"dur":0,"text":"But this trajectory does make sense"},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"in terms of consistency, right?"},"562":{"dur":4,"text":"So if daily sounds like\na really good thing,"},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"then why don't I do it?"},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"Why am I still doing this\ntwo videos a week thing?"},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"Well if I tried to do daily

standard"},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's how I balance\nwith these three things."},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"If I try to do daily,"},"590":{"dur":1,"text":"then the quality wouldn't be

way"},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"for developing loyalty in your audience."},"605":{"dur":4,"text":"So consistency here not only\nhelps you build an audience,"},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"but it helps you

more\nserious with it though,"},"650":{"dur":3,"text":"I cut it down to these four topics here,"},"653":{"dur":1,"text":"and this is what I did for,"},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"I think it was at least two years,"},"656":{"dur":3,"text":"was fashion, design, diy, and vlogs."},"660":{"dur":1,"text":"Recently though,"},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"I've felt like I've finally\ngained the

vlogs,"},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"like showing behind the scenes of my life."},"672":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm glad that I went through\nthis transition through topics."},"675":{"dur":3,"text":"A lot of you here might have\nvlogs or Instagram accounts"},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"or whatever that you already know"},"681":{"dur":1,"text":"what topics you should be talking about,"},"682":{"dur":1,"text":"so you can probably jump in\nin a much more refined stage"},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"than I did."},"685":{"dur":2,"text":"But all of this has really\nhelped build out my personality"},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"on YouTube too,"},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"like people can see other\nthings that I'm interested in,"},"691":{"dur":1,"text":"so that's been really

and commit to that."},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"'Cause that was the reason\nthat I started YouTube"},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"was to talk about design,"},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"because there wasn't that\nmany people doing that"},"705":{"dur":1,"text":"when I first started."},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"So all throughout,"},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"even though there's been all\nthese other topics in the
