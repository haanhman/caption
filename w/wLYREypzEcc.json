there-- we-- I\nnever saw a picture of Dan Goleman."},"383":{"dur":3,"text":"I turned to this guy who is sitting\nnext to me and I said you're Dan Goleman"},"387":{"dur":4,"text":"and this wasn't any kind of psychic power."},"393":{"dur":6,"text":"Dan looked like he just returned\nfrom India, if you know what I mean."},"400":{"dur":5,"text":"So it didn't take much insight\nto pick him out from the crowd."},"405":{"dur":10,"text":"And so that evening, Dan asked me if I\nwanted a ride back home and I said sure."},"416":{"dur":7,"text":"And we began to talk and he took me-- I\nwent to his car which is a VW Microbus"},"424":{"dur":10,"text":"and it was plastered with pictures of yogis\nfrom floor to ceiling in this VW Microbus."},"434":{"dur":5,"text":"And then he suggested-- well maybe we had such\na warmhearted conversation that first day,"},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"he said why don't you come back to my house"},"442":{"dur":4,"text":"and we'll just continue talking\nand I'll take you home later."},"447":{"dur":8,"text":"So I go back to his house and the\nperson who opens the door was Ram Dass."},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"Some of you might have heard of Ram Dass."},"458":{"dur":4,"text":"He's a former professor of\npsychology who was fired from Harvard"},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"for giving psychedelic drugs to undergraduates."},"467":{"dur":5,"text":"And he had gone off to India\nto seek spiritual insights."},"472":{"dur":11,"text":"And so Ram Dass was around\nCambridge, Massachusetts at that time."},"483":{"dur":3,"text":"And it quickly became very apparent to\nme that this was an important source"},"487":{"dur":5,"text":"of an alternative education which would be\nproceeding in parallel with my formal education."},"494":{"dur":7,"text":"So we did a little bit of research as I\nindicated in this early period of time,"},"501":{"dur":5,"text":"but my professors made it very clear to me that\nif I wanted a successful career in science,"},"507":{"dur":6,"text":"this was a terrible way to begin\nand I better find some other topic"},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"that was more mainstream and viable."},"516":{"dur":6,"text":"And so I was a very dutiful student\nand I began to pursue a career looking"},"523":{"dur":6,"text":"at the brain mechanisms and systems\nthat underlie emotion which is something"},"529":{"dur":5,"text":"that I still very much do today and I\nsee the work that we do on the impact"},"535":{"dur":5,"text":"of contemplative practice very much within\nthis framework because one of the key targets"},"541":{"dur":6,"text":"of these practices is to transform emotion,\nto transform our relationship to emotions,"},"547":{"dur":6,"text":"to transform how we respond to life's\nslings and arrows which is something"},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"that has always interested me and this work--"},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"the contemplative work really\nfits within this overall rubric."},"562":{"dur":8,"text":"And for many years, I became what I have\nsupplementally called myself a closet meditator."},"572":{"dur":4,"text":"There were very few people in\nthe academy who had any idea"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"that I was interested in these topics."},"580":{"dur":8,"text":"And I think it's fair to say that when I was\nhired on faculty at the University of Wisconsin"},"588":{"dur":4,"text":"in Madison, none of my colleagues had any\ninterest what they were getting themselves into"},"593":{"dur":4,"text":"and had no idea that I had\ninterest in this area."},"598":{"dur":9,"text":"And all of this changed and to use a phrase\nthat my dear friend Jon Kabat-Zinn uses a lot,"},"607":{"dur":3,"text":"my life went through in orthogonal rotation."},"612":{"dur":4,"text":"And it went through that\northogonal rotation in 1992"},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"when I first met His Holiness the Dalai Lama."},"620":{"dur":9,"text":"I went to see him in Dharamsala, India at his\ninvitation with a small group of scientists,"},"629":{"dur":5,"text":"three or four scientists, and of\nthe scientists was Francisco Varela."},"635":{"dur":7,"text":"And we were interested in talking with His\nHoliness the Dalai Lama and he was interested"},"643":{"dur":8,"text":"in talking to us about doing serious\nneuroscientific research on the minds and brains"},"652":{"dur":4,"text":"of Tibetan practitioners who have\nspent years training their mind."},"658":{"dur":5,"text":"And he challenged me on that day in 1992\nwhen he said, \"Look, you've been using tools"},"664":{"dur":6,"text":"of modern neuroscience to study\nanxiety and depression and fear."},"670":{"dur":3,"text":"Why can't you use those same tools\nto study kindness and compassion?\""},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was a wake-up call for me."},"678":{"dur":6,"text":"And I didn't have a very good answer for\nhim other than it's hard, but, you know,"},"684":{"dur":5,"text":"when we first began to study\nanxiety and fear, that was hard too"},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"and I think most scientists would agree"},"692":{"dur":3,"text":"that neuroscientific research\nhas made considerable progress"},"696":{"dur":5,"text":"in understanding the brain systems\nassociated with anxiety and fear"},"703":{"dur":6,"text":"and so there is no fundamental reason why\nwe couldn't approach these other topics"},"709":{"dur":1,"text":"in the same rigorous way."},"711":{"dur":4,"text":"And I made a commitment to the Dalai\nLama on that day in 1992 that I was going"},"716":{"dur":5,"text":"to do everything I could to put\ncompassion and kindness squarely"},"721":{"dur":3,"text":"within the crosshairs of\nmodern mainstream science."},"725":{"dur":5,"text":"And I think if you go back to textbooks\nin that day, to textbooks of psychology,"},"730":{"dur":6,"text":"and if you look to see whether the word\ncompassion or kindness was in the index"},"737":{"dur":3,"text":"of those books, I doubt that very many--"},"740":{"dur":9,"text":"if any textbooks of psychology even mention\nthe word compassion which in my view"},"750":{"dur":7,"text":"in retrospect is really nothing short of\nunfortunate and even scandalous, I would say."},"758":{"dur":3,"text":"But the good news is that that's all changing."},"762":{"dur":9,"text":"And it's changing in a way which is more\nrapid and penetrating into the in interstices"},"771":{"dur":7,"text":"of our culture in different segments in ways\nthat I never expected to occur so quickly."},"779":{"dur":6,"text":"And I think that there are four themes\nor four developments in modern science"},"786":{"dur":3,"text":"which had paved the way for\nthis work to go forward"},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'd like to name those themes explicitly."},"793":{"dur":1,"text":"One is neuroplasticity."},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"And many of you have heard this word."},"800":{"dur":5,"text":"And neuroplasticity simply means that the\nbrain is the organ which has built to change"},"805":{"dur":4,"text":"in response to experience more\nthan any other organ in our body."},"809":{"dur":5,"text":"And neuroplasticity happens\nwillingly or unwillingly."},"815":{"dur":3,"text":"And I would like to invite\nthe suggestion that most"},"819":{"dur":4,"text":"of the time our brains are\nbeing shaped unwillingly."},"824":{"dur":5,"text":"We are largely unaware of the\nforces that are shaping our brains."},"829":{"dur":6,"text":"And the invitation in all of this work is that\nwe can actually all take more responsibility"},"836":{"dur":6,"text":"for our own brains and we can intentionally\nshape our brains willingly in a way"},"842":{"dur":3,"text":"that will help support healthy habits of mind."},"847":{"dur":3,"text":"So the first theme is neuroplasticity."},"851":{"dur":5,"text":"The second theme is the equivalent of\nneuroplasticity in the realm of genomics."},"858":{"dur":2,"text":"And the second theme is epigenetics."},"862":{"dur":7,"text":"We are learning today that gene\nexpression is much more dynamic"},"870":{"dur":2,"text":"and variable than we ever thought."},"872":{"dur":6,"text":"Yes, we are all born with a fixed\ncomplemented base pairs that constitute our DNA,"},"880":{"dur":5,"text":"but many of our genes have little volume\ncontrols that range from low to high"},"886":{"dur":8,"text":"and the extent to which a gene is expressed is\ndynamic and is influenced by the environments"},"895":{"dur":4,"text":"in which you reside, by the\ninteractions that we have with others,"},"900":{"dur":2,"text":"by our demeanor, by our emotions."},"904":{"dur":5,"text":"There is hard-nosed biological\nresearch that shows, for example,"},"910":{"dur":7,"text":"that the way a mother interacts with her\noffspring will induce epigenetic changes"},"917":{"dur":7,"text":"in the offspring that can persist for a\nlong period of time that regulate systems"},"924":{"dur":4,"text":"in the brain and that influence\nbehavior and experience in profound ways."},"930":{"dur":7,"text":"And so even if we have a genetic propensity,\nso to speak, for a certain kind of behavior"},"938":{"dur":7,"text":"at least within some range that can be\ninfluenced by our demeanor, by our interactions,"},"946":{"dur":2,"text":"our interpersonal interactions with others."},"948":{"dur":5,"text":"And the suggestion that I'd like to\ninvite us to consider this evening is"},"954":{"dur":5,"text":"that it also can be influenced by the\nextent to which we train our minds."},"961":{"dur":5,"text":"And in fact just this year, we\npublished a scientific paper showing"},"966":{"dur":4,"text":"that when we bring long-term meditation\npractitioners into the laboratory"},"971":{"dur":7,"text":"and we have them meditate intensively for\neight hours, we actually can see a change"},"979":{"dur":5,"text":"in gene expression over the course of that\neight-hour period, in just eight hours."},"985":{"dur":6,"text":"And we can measure that and\nit turns out to be associated"},"991":{"dur":1,"text":"with certain behavioral characteristics."},"993":{"dur":9,"text":"And this kind of work again provides an\nimportant clue for one of the many mechanisms"},"1003":{"dur":4,"text":"through which the salubrious\nchanges that may be induced"},"1007":{"dur":4,"text":"by these practices actually\noccur at a biological level."},"1012":{"dur":4,"text":"So the first theme was neuroplasticity,\nthe second theme was epigenetics."},"1017":{"dur":7,"text":"The third theme in this list of four themes is\nthe discovery of massive bidirectional highways"},"1025":{"dur":2,"text":"that connect the brain and the body."},"1028":{"dur":4,"text":"These are the highways through\nwhich mind-body interaction occurs."},"1033":{"dur":8,"text":"This is why it is through these\npathways that the association"},"1041":{"dur":5,"text":"between well-being and physical\nhealth may arise."},"1047":{"dur":6,"text":"There are now large epidemiological studies\nthat have unequivocally shown in association"},"1054":{"dur":3,"text":"between psychological well-being\nand physical health."},"1058":{"dur":4,"text":"There is no doubt that individuals\nwho have higher levels of well-being"},"1063":{"dur":2,"text":"on average also have better physical health."},"1066":{"dur":4,"text":"Now we don't exactly know what the mechanism for\nthis is and certainly there are many exceptions,"},"1071":{"dur":5,"text":"but if you look at large samples of\nindividuals, this association emerges."},"1077":{"dur":7,"text":"And it suggests that influencing\nthe mind in ways"},"1084":{"dur":4,"text":"that can promote well-being may\nalso have changes in the body"},"1090":{"dur":5,"text":"that support better physical health."},"1096":{"dur":10,"text":"It also suggests that influencing the\nbody directly may modulate the brain"},"1106":{"dur":3,"text":"and the mind in ways which can be beneficial."},"1110":{"dur":6,"text":"These pathways are bidirectional\nand this gives us some basis"},"1117":{"dur":7,"text":"for examining how body-oriented practices\nmay actually influence the brain and the mind"},"1124":{"dur":2,"text":"in ways that can promote well-being."},"1127":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's the third theme."},"1129":{"dur":4,"text":"The fourth theme I would\nsay honestly is the theme"},"1134":{"dur":6,"text":"that probably has the least empirical\nsupport at this point in time,"},"1140":{"dur":6,"text":"but I would say the empirical support is\ngrowing substantially, but because of that,"},"1146":{"dur":6,"text":"it's probably the most controversial and in\nmy view also perhaps the most interesting."},"1154":{"dur":8,"text":"And that fourth theme is that\nthere is innate basic goodness."},"1164":{"dur":6,"text":"I'll say it again, there\nis innate basic goodness."},"1172":{"dur":8,"text":"And what I mean by that is that if given a\nchoice, an individual will particularly early"},"1180":{"dur":6,"text":"in life will choose encounters which\nare warm-hearted and altruistic compared"},"1187":{"dur":2,"text":"with encounters that are selfish and aggressive."},"1190":{"dur":6,"text":"And there is hard-nosed evidence\nthat supports this."},"1196":{"dur":1,"text":"And let me just give you one example."},"1199":{"dur":7,"text":"If you take six-month old human\nbabies and you show them video clips"},"1206":{"dur":7,"text":"that depict warm-hearted altruistic cooperative\ninteractions and you contrast that with videos"},"1213":{"dur":5,"text":"that are matched on physical characteristics\nwith interactions that are selfish"},"1220":{"dur":7,"text":"and aggressive, you can ask a\nsix-month old infant which it prefers"},"1228":{"dur":2,"text":"and it prefers the warm-hearted one."},"1230":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, how do you ask a six-month old infant?"},"1233":{"dur":2,"text":"Well the way you can ask a six-month old infant"},"1236":{"dur":5,"text":"in the laboratory is we can monitor very\nprecisely where the baby is looking."},"1242":{"dur":5,"text":"We can use infrared eye tracking to actually\nlook to see where the baby is looking."},"1248":{"dur":5,"text":"And the baby at six-month of\nage dramatically prefers to look"},"1254":{"dur":3,"text":"at the warm-hearted cooperative\ninteraction compared"},"1257":{"dur":2,"text":"to the selfish and aggressive interaction."},"1259":{"dur":2,"text":"The data are really compelling."},"1262":{"dur":8,"text":"And this kind of data lends support to the\nview that there is innate basic goodness."},"1271":{"dur":4,"text":"It doesn't mean that these negative\nqualities don't exist early in life."},"1276":{"dur":2,"text":"It simply means that when given a choice,"},"1279":{"dur":8,"text":"an individual will choose the warm-hearted\nbranch compared to the one that is selfish."},"1289":{"dur":4,"text":"Now one of the reasons why\nthis is so interesting is"},"1293":{"dur":9,"text":"because in the contemplative traditions it's\noften said that when we engage in practices"},"1303":{"dur":5,"text":"to cultivate compassion, we're not creating\nthis compassion de novo, so to speak,"},"1308":{"dur":6,"text":"but rather we are recognizing a\nquality which is part of our nature."},"1317":{"dur":9,"text":"And the way I think about compassion is\nvery similar to the way psychologists"},"1326":{"dur":2,"text":"and neuroscientists have thought about language."},"1329":{"dur":5,"text":"We all come into the world with an\ninnate predisposition for language,"},"1335":{"dur":6,"text":"but the normal expression of language requires\nthat we be raised in a linguistic community"},"1342":{"dur":5,"text":"and there are a few case reports of federal\nchildren who've been raised in the wild"},"1348":{"dur":2,"text":"and they do no develop normal language."},"1351":{"dur":5,"text":"And it may be similar with compassion."},"1357":{"dur":5,"text":"We all come into the world with these\nseeds of kindness and compassion,"},"1362":{"dur":4,"text":"but in order of those seeds to flourish,\nin order for them to be expressed,"},"1367":{"dur":8,"text":"it may require being in a community\nthat exhibits those kinds of qualities."},"1375":{"dur":5,"text":"And so when we engage in contemplative\npractices to cultivate these qualities,"},"1381":{"dur":4,"text":"we may be recognizing something\nwhich is already present."},"1386":{"dur":5,"text":"And the word meditation in Sanskrit, one of\nits original definitions is familiarization."},"1392":{"dur":6,"text":"And we become familiar through these practices\nwith the fundamental nature of our own minds."},"1400":{"dur":4,"text":"One component of which is\nthis innate basic goodness."},"1405":{"dur":6,"text":"So those four themes, neuroplasticity,\nepigenetics, these bidirectional highways"},"1411":{"dur":1,"text":"that exist between the brain and the body"},"1413":{"dur":6,"text":"and innate basic goodness are really\nimportant developments in modern science"},"1420":{"dur":3,"text":"which has enabled this work\nto go forward in a way"},"1424":{"dur":2,"text":"which has never happened\nbefore in human history."},"1427":{"dur":8,"text":"And this area has now become quite a vibrant\narea in part due to the efforts of the Mind"},"1435":{"dur":3,"text":"and Life Institute and Adam\nEngle is sitting here."},"1438":{"dur":9,"text":"I just want to recognize him for-- he was the\nfirst president and founder of Mind and Life."},"1447":{"dur":5,"text":"And the development of this\nfield of contemplative science"},"1452":{"dur":6,"text":"and contemplative neuroscience, I\nattribute significantly to the efforts"},"1459":{"dur":3,"text":"of Mind and Life in field building."},"1463":{"dur":7,"text":"And they're now is a whole cohort of young\nscientists and it's been wonderful to meet

throughout\nalready, but let me say a little bit more."},"1495":{"dur":6,"text":"After the first meeting I had with His\nHoliness the Dalai Lama, it took us a few years"},"1502":{"dur":8,"text":"to

dimensions"},"1516":{"dur":4,"text":"of our mind and the brain and experience."},"1520":{"dur":1,"text":"One of them is attention."},"1522":{"dur":5,"text":"When I was a graduate student, I was a\ngraduate student in William James Hall"},"1527":{"dur":4,"text":"and although not a single page of\nWilliam James was formally assigned to me"},"1531":{"dur":4,"text":"as a graduate student, I
