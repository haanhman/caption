them"},"227":{"dur":2,"text":"to do, and also, as\nan arts organisation,"},"229":{"dur":3,"text":"that gave us an opportunity\nto do on ourselves."},"232":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that the Nesta\nstructure-- which"},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"brought us together\nfor the workshops,"},"237":{"dur":2,"text":"and enabled us to see what\nother people were doing,"},"239":{"dur":2,"text":"and to

publishing,"},"270":{"dur":2,"text":"and we work very much\nwith the cover image"},"272":{"dur":2,"text":"and the blurb and then the text."},"275":{"dur":0,"text":"It's all very wordy."},"276":{"dur":3,"text":"But when you're trying to\nshrink it down to an app size,"},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"you're really only looking\nat small bits and bytes"},"282":{"dur":0,"text":"of information."},"283":{"dur":3,"text":"And Alastair was really good\nat getting us to concentrate"},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"on the essential, and\ncame up with our tag line"},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"as

personnel"},"296":{"dur":3,"text":"and the know how-- the CMS--\nthere's not much of a cost"},"300":{"dur":1,"text":"But with an app\nupdate it's something"},"302":{"dur":1,"text":"that you don't want to\nbe doing all the time,"},"304":{"dur":1,"text":"because you have to\nre-submit it to Apple,"},"306":{"dur":2,"text":"and then the users\nhave to update it."},"308":{"dur":3,"text":"And clearly, it would\nbecome annoying for the user"},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"if there were updates\nevery week, say."},"314":{"dur":4,"text":"So you really have\nto be aware that it's"},"318":{"dur":4,"text":"a

minimum."},"326":{"dur":2,"text":"And that when we went\nto refresh the app,"},"329":{"dur":3,"text":"we'll probably end up doing\nit every three months or so."},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"I think it's really\nimportant for the publishers"},"334":{"dur":4,"text":"to factor those skills\ninto their own companies"},"339":{"dur":2,"text":"and to embrace\ndigital technology,"},"341":{"dur":3,"text":"and not to outsource\ntoo much of it,"},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"but really to learn themselves."},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's what we wanted to do."},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"I think it's really

opportunities."},"357":{"dur":4,"text":"And there are real opportunities\nin the digital sphere."},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"So for example, although\nthe app is very much"},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"focused on Scotland,\nyou can download it"},"366":{"dur":0,"text":"anywhere in the world."},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you're hoping to\nmake a journey to Scotland"},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"and wanting to come to the\nborders or the highlands"},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"or whatever, it gives you\na set of books, perhaps,"},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"to read before you go,\nor after you've been."},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think that would have\nbeen-- that kind of marketing"},"380":{"dur":1,"text":"and that kind of\nreach would have"},"381":{"dur":2,"text":"been really difficult\nto achieve in the past."},"383":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that we\nwere really pleased"},"385":{"dur":4,"text":"that we had factored such\na lot of content into it."},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"And I know this sounds like a\nslightly silly thing to say,"},"392":{"dur":1,"text":"but it kind of looks\nlike a small thing."},"394":{"dur":3,"text":"The

present"},"401":{"dur":1,"text":"on this screen."},"403":{"dur":3,"text":"And it was really\nfun doing that."},"406":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think that's\nprobably what we
