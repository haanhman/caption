look like?"},"79":{"dur":4,"text":"What can you say when describing a person\u2019s\nappearance?"},"84":{"dur":3,"text":"You can talk about the person\u2019s height

few suggestions:"},"184":{"dur":5,"text":"\"He looks a bit like a younger version of\nVin Diesel.\""},"190":{"dur":4,"text":"\"She\u2019s really beautiful, with very

cut\nor have an operation."},"232":{"dur":8,"text":"Okay, so now you should be able to make three\nsentences about the person you\u2019re describing,"},"241":{"dur":1,"text":"like this:"},"242":{"dur":4,"text":"\"My brother is quite tall and well-built."},"246":{"dur":4,"text":"He has short, brown hair, but he\u2019s going\nbald fast."},"250":{"dur":6,"text":"He looks a bit

characteristics."},"291":{"dur":6,"text":"Another question: what\u2019s this person like?"},"297":{"dur":3,"text":"Do you know what this question means?"},"300":{"dur":5,"text":"It means I want you to tell me about the person\u2019s\npersonality."},"306":{"dur":7,"text":"Let\u2019s start with positive words you can\nuse to talk about someone\u2019s character."},"313":{"dur":2,"text":"Think about the person you\u2019re describing."},"316":{"dur":7,"text":"What good things can you say about him or\nher?"},"323":{"dur":8,"text":"You could describe someone as 'kind', but\nit\u2019s better to be more specific if you can."},"332":{"dur":6,"text":"Better words to use are 'considerate'\u2014meaning\nsomeone who always thinks about other people"},"338":{"dur":7,"text":"and their needs\u2014or 'warm'\u2014meaning someone\nwho shows positive feelings to others and"},"346":{"dur":3,"text":"makes other people feel good."},"349":{"dur":5,"text":"Or, maybe this person is good at making other\npeople laugh."},"355":{"dur":4,"text":"You could say they are 'funny' or that they\nhave a 'good sense of humour'."},"360":{"dur":7,"text":"More generally, you can describe someone as\n'fun' or 'entertaining' if people enjoy spending"},"367":{"dur":3,"text":"time with them."},"370":{"dur":1,"text":"What else?"},"372":{"dur":6,"text":"Well, for a friend, it\u2019s very important\nthat a person is 'reliable'\u2014that you can"},"378":{"dur":6,"text":"depend on them to keep their promises and\nbe there for you when you need them."},"384":{"dur":5,"text":"Similarly, you could describe

time"},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"with."},"400":{"dur":5,"text":"Straightforward people say what they think,\nbut not in a rude way, and they don\u2019t keep"},"406":{"dur":4,"text":"secrets or gossip about other people."},"410":{"dur":3,"text":"Let\u2019s look at three more."},"414":{"dur":6,"text":"Most of us like spending time with people\nwho are 'cheerful'\u2014people who smile a lot"},"420":{"dur":3,"text":"and are usually in a good mood."},"423":{"dur":6,"text":"Cheerful people are often 'positive' and 'optimistic'\u2014they\nexpect good things to happen."},"430":{"dur":9,"text":"So now you have twelve positive adjectives\nyou can use to describe someone\u2019s personality."},"439":{"dur":6,"text":"Can you use any of these adjectives to talk\nabout the person you\u2019re describing?"},"446":{"dur":6,"text":"When you use these adjectives, always try\nto add an example or a reason."},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"For example, don\u2019t just say:"},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"\"My brother is really funny.\""},"456":{"dur":4,"text":"\"My friend Lia is a very cheerful person.\""},"461":{"dur":6,"text":"Add some details or examples to make

moment.\""},"477":{"dur":4,"text":"\"My friend Lia is a very cheerful person."},"482":{"dur":4,"text":"Even early in the morning, she\u2019s always\nsmiling and in a good mood."},"486":{"dur":4,"text":"I don\u2019t know how she does it!\""},"491":{"dur":7,"text":"If possible, you could even add a story to\nreally illustrate the person\u2019s character."},"499":{"dur":4,"text":"\"Craig, who I work with, is such an honest\nguy."},"503":{"dur":5,"text":"I remember one time he found a wallet with\n\u00a3500 in a

to\nkeep it, and he insisted on going straight"},"520":{"dur":4,"text":"to the police, right that minute.\""},"525":{"dur":5,"text":"Adding stories like this can really bring\na description to life."},"530":{"dur":5,"text":"You\u2019ve also seen some good ways to use these\nadjectives:"},"535":{"dur":3,"text":"\"My brother is really _______.\""},"539":{"dur":9,"text":"\"My friend Lia is a very ________ .\"\n\"Craig is such an _______ guy.\""},"548":{"dur":7,"text":"Of course, you can change these and use them\nin your answer."},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"What about you?"},"557":{"dur":7,"text":"Pause the video, and try to use some of these\nadjectives about the person you\u2019re describing."},"565":{"dur":6,"text":"Don\u2019t forget to add details and examples\nto your description, or you can even add a"},"571":{"dur":3,"text":"story if possible!"},"574":{"dur":6,"text":"Next, let\u2019s look at part three: describing\nnegative characteristics."},"581":{"dur":3,"text":"No one\u2019s perfect, right?"},"584":{"dur":7,"text":"We all have our flaws, so let\u2019s look at\nhow to describe the bad side of someone\u2019s"},"591":{"dur":1,"text":"personality."},"593":{"dur":6,"text":"Many of the words you saw in part two have\ndirect opposites which you can use."},"599":{"dur":1,"text":"For example:"},"601":{"dur":6,"text":"'kind' \u2192 'unkind'\n'considerate' \u2192 'inconsiderate'"},"607":{"dur":5,"text":"'honest' \u2192 'dishonest'\n'reliable' \u2192 'unreliable'"},"613":{"dur":7,"text":"Of course, there are other words you can use,\ntoo."},"620":{"dur":8,"text":"Some people can be 'selfish' or 'self-centered'\u2014they\nthink about themselves too much, and don\u2019t"},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"think about the needs of others."},"632":{"dur":3,"text":"These two words have a similar meaning."},"636":{"dur":4,"text":"Even more extreme, you can describe someone\nas 'self-obsessed'."},"640":{"dur":6,"text":"A self-obsessed person only thinks about themselves,\nand doesn\u2019t seem to realise that other people"},"647":{"dur":3,"text":"exist at all!"},"651":{"dur":6,"text":"Not everyone can be funny, but you don\u2019t\nwant to be seen as 'humourless' or 'dull'."},"657":{"dur":7,"text":"'Dull' is similar to 'boring', while 'humourless'\nmeans that someone has no sense of humour"},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"and is too serious."},"668":{"dur":6,"text":"If someone doesn\u2019t do what they say or doesn\u2019t\nkeep their promises, you\u2019ve already seen"},"674":{"dur":6,"text":"two words you can use: 'dishonest' or 'unreliable'."},"680":{"dur":9,"text":"Similarly, you could describe someone as 'insincere'\u2014meaning\nthat someone says things without meaning them."},"690":{"dur":7,"text":"For example, if someone is always friendly\non the surface, but they don\u2019t really feel"},"697":{"dur":6,"text":"anything inside, you could describe that person\nas insincere."},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"Their friendliness doesn\u2019t mean anything."},"707":{"dur":7,"text":"Finally, cheerful people are always in a good\nmood, but what\u2019s the opposite?"},"714":{"dur":3,"text":"You could describe someone as 'moody' or 'grumpy'."},"718":{"dur":6,"text":"Moody people\u2019s moods change very easily,\nand they are often in a bad mood."},"725":{"dur":8,"text":"Grumpy people never seem to be in a good mood\nand are always unhappy and negative."},"734":{"dur":9,"text":"So now, you have twelve negative adjectives\nto go with your twelve positive adjectives!"},"743":{"dur":8,"text":"As before, when you use these adjectives to\ndescribe someone, try to add details or examples."},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"For example:"},"754":{"dur":6,"text":"\"My brother can be a little unreliable sometimes."},"760":{"dur":5,"text":"He often \u2018forgets\u2019 to do things he

everyone."},"788":{"dur":4,"text":"It makes him quite difficult to be around.\""},"793":{"dur":6,"text":"You can see how we often use slightly more\nindirect language to talk about someone\u2019s"},"800":{"dur":2,"text":"negative characteristics:"},"802":{"dur":5,"text":"\"My brother can be a little _______ sometimes.\""},"807":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Sometimes I feel that she\u2019s a bit ________.\""},"811":{"dur":7,"text":"Of course, if you really want to be direct,\nyou can be:"},"818":{"dur":3,"text":"\"My colleague is so ________.\""},"822":{"dur":7,"text":"Now, pause the

________.\""},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"Do you know what 'get on' means here?"},"866":{"dur":6,"text":"By itself, it means to have a good relationship\nwith someone."},"872":{"dur":5,"text":"You can add adverbs after 'get on' to give\nit different meanings."},"878":{"dur":1,"text":"For example:"},"879":{"dur":2,"text":"\"We get on very well.\""},"881":{"dur":3,"text":"\"We get on well sometimes.\""},"885":{"dur":3,"text":"Or you can make it negative:"},"889":{"dur":4,"text":"\"We don\u2019t get on very well.\""},"893":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, look at the sentences again:"},"896":{"dur":1,"text":"\"We\u2019ve known each other ________.\""},"897":{"dur":1,"text":"\"We met ________.\""},"898":{"dur":1,"text":"\"We get on _______, because

to use all of these sentences."},"945":{"dur":5,"text":"For example, if you\u2019re talking about your\nbrother or another relative, it doesn\u2019t"},"951":{"dur":5,"text":"make sense to talk about how long you\u2019ve\nknown each other or where you met."},"956":{"dur":6,"text":"However, you can still talk about how well\nyou get on and why."},"963":{"dur":6,"text":"You could also add how often
