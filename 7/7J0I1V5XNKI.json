letters."},"256":{"dur":2,"text":"And the reason they did\nwas that the Roman elite"},"258":{"dur":1,"text":"was a bunch of\nintermarried families."},"260":{"dur":2,"text":"And the political news\nand the social news"},"262":{"dur":3,"text":"were very tangled up because\nif two families fell out,"},"265":{"dur":1,"text":"that could actually\nmean civil war."},"267":{"dur":2,"text":"And if two

social\nand the political"},"297":{"dur":1,"text":"are very closely mixed together."},"299":{"dur":1,"text":"Here's another example."},"301":{"dur":1,"text":"On this occasion, Cicero\nhas written a letter"},"303":{"dur":3,"text":"criticizing Caesar, and he's\nput it into general circulation."},"307":{"dur":3,"text":"So he's sent copies of it\nto many of his friends,"},"310":{"dur":1,"text":"and they've copied\nto and passed it on."},"312":{"dur":3,"text":"And he's also kept-- because\nhe kept copies of everything he"},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"sent-- he would have\nkept the rough

this is what he's\nallow to happen here."},"331":{"dur":1,"text":"And the same would\nhappen with speeches."},"333":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you were a Roman\nand you gave a

could."},"356":{"dur":1,"text":"Actually, you would\nchoose the patron"},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"who had the most foot traffic\ngoing through his library."},"360":{"dur":1,"text":"And you would then\nhave the book put"},"362":{"dur":1,"text":"in his library or\nyour dedicated to him."},"364":{"dur":1,"text":"And you would hope\nthat the people passing"},"366":{"dur":1,"text":"through the library would\nread it and be so impressed"},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"that they would ask\nfor a copy of it."},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"And at that point, he would\nget his scribes to make a copy."},"371":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is why the slaves and\nthe scribes are like broadband."},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"The marginal cost per page\nis zero at this point."},"378":{"dur":1,"text":"Because he's paid for\nthe slave, and he's"},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"paying for the upkeep of\nthe slave in the same way"},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"that you pay

were\nreally successful,"},"397":{"dur":1,"text":"you could tell you'd\nmake it as a Roman author"},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"if you went to the book\nseller's street in Rome"},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"and

would only do that if\nthere was sufficient demand"},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"so books were\npropagating socially."},"418":{"dur":1,"text":"But my favorite\nexample is the way"},"420":{"dur":3,"text":"the news circulated in the\nsort of official gazette."},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's called\nthe \"Acta Diurna.\""},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"It was founded by\nJulius

put up in the Forum."},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you want to read it,\nyou have to go to the Forum"},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"and read it yourself."},"465":{"dur":3,"text":"Or, if you were a

then you could\nread it over breakfast."},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"And you would do that using a\ndevice that looked like this."},"477":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is a Roman

way to go."},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"Anyway, they also\nhave the smaller ones"},"495":{"dur":3,"text":"we saw early on which\nis this sort of thing."},"499":{"dur":1,"text":"These were things you\ncould note stuff down on."},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"I'll go back to the\nRoman iPad there."},"504":{"dur":1,"text":"So you could then\nread the news on this,"},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"and then you would send\nthe news that you thought"},"508":{"dur":1,"text":"would interest your friends\nto them in a letter."},"510":{"dur":3,"text":"And we see this-- we see it in\nthe letters of Pliny and Pliny"},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"the Elder and also in\nletters of Cicero and Tacitus"},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"talked about this as well-- that\nwhen a Roman was outside
