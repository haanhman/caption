that there is a future in looking"},"2835":{"dur":5,"text":"at an approach with China, looking at where\nthe commonalities are \u2013 it\u2019d be interesting"},"2840":{"dur":5,"text":"to get your

some steps to accommodate our\nviews."},"2879":{"dur":1,"text":"DEPUTY SECRETARY BLINKEN: Sure."},"2881":{"dur":10,"text":"I think that there are clear trends and lessons\nthat suggest that in various

we\u2019ve\never had, less because of what we\u2019ve done"},"2931":{"dur":1,"text":"than because of what China has done."},"2933":{"dur":5,"text":"We\u2019ll have the general secretary of

different place, and part of that has"},"2952":{"dur":3,"text":"been actually energized by China\u2019s actions."},"2955":{"dur":5,"text":"I had some interesting conversations the last\ntime I was in Beijing and then again at the"},"2961":{"dur":6,"text":"Strategic & Economic Dialogue with China about\nthat, and I suggested to them that while our"},"2967":{"dur":4,"text":"countries were, of

China"},"2978":{"dur":3,"text":"today is a little bit where the United States\nwas at the end of World War II."},"2982":{"dur":5,"text":"Then, we were the emerging global power, and\nour leaders had to decide how to use that"},"2988":{"dur":1,"text":"power."},"2989":{"dur":6,"text":"And of course, the decisions that they made\nwere to write the rules, create the institutions,"},"2995":{"dur":4,"text":"develop the norms that on one level actually\nconstrained our power, because we gave other"},"3000":{"dur":4,"text":"countries a voice and a vote and an ability\nto shape the direction of the world."},"3005":{"dur":6,"text":"And yet, of course, the real effect was to\ndisincentivize other countries from gathering"},"3011":{"dur":3,"text":"together against us because they feared our\npower."},"3014":{"dur":4,"text":"And as a result, we actually magnified and\nextended our influence."},"3019":{"dur":4,"text":"And I suggested to our Chinese

in"},"3038":{"dur":3,"text":"terms of how other nations respond."},"3041":{"dur":8,"text":"Second, when you think about the wealth of\na nation and what defines it, if we talked"},"3050":{"dur":4,"text":"about that 50 years ago or 100 years ago,\nyou\u2019d probably talk about how large the"},"3055":{"dur":4,"text":"country is, the size of its land mass, the\nsize of its population, the strength and size"},"3059":{"dur":3,"text":"of its military, the abundance of natural\nresources."},"3062":{"dur":3,"text":"And of course, all of those things still matter,\nand as it happens, the United States and China"},"3066":{"dur":2,"text":"are both very wealthy by those measures."},"3069":{"dur":6,"text":"But we know that in this century, the true\nwealth of a nation is defined by its human"},"3075":{"dur":6,"text":"resources and especially their ability to\ninnovate, to create, to think, to exchange"},"3082":{"dur":2,"text":"ideas, to argue, to criticize."},"3085":{"dur":6,"text":"The nations that maximize that potential are\nthe nations that will truly succeed in the"},"3091":{"dur":4,"text":"21st century, and that too has implications\nfor China."},"3095":{"dur":1,"text":"We haven\u2019t seen them yet."},"3096":{"dur":3,"text":"I\u2019m convinced that we will."},"3100":{"dur":6,"text":"So I think there are larger dynamics at play\nthat suggest to me that over the next 10 or"},"3107":{"dur":5,"text":"15 years, there will be effects on the way\nChina decides to conduct itself in the world"},"3113":{"dur":3,"text":"that move it actually closer to us."},"3116":{"dur":8,"text":"At the same time, here and now, as they take\nactions that are inconsistent with our interests,"},"3124":{"dur":4,"text":"we will uphold those interests, and I talked\na little bit about the South China Seas."},"3129":{"dur":6,"text":"But we also believe that the more we can maximize\nareas of cooperation \u2013 and obviously, trade"},"3135":{"dur":4,"text":"and investment is critical because of the\nbenefits that it brings to both of us, and"},"3140":{"dur":8,"text":"that creates at least a frame around which\nthe relationship hopefully will not deviate"},"3148":{"dur":3,"text":"because of the common interest in preserving\nthose benefits."},"3152":{"dur":6,"text":"But the more that we do that, I think the\nmore it will be clearly in the interest of"},"3158":{"dur":8,"text":"China to make accommodations where our interests\nare in conflict."},"3167":{"dur":5,"text":"MODERATOR: Right

than"},"3248":{"dur":1,"text":"we ever have."},"3249":{"dur":7,"text":"Second, actual, practical cooperation when\nit comes to exercises, when it comes to working"},"3257":{"dur":10,"text":"together in areas like counter-piracy or humanitarian\nresponse \u2013 that too builds trust and confidence."},"3268":{"dur":6,"text":"And then finally, making sure that we have\nmechanisms in place to deal
