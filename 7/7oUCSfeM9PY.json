go into making a product,"},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"they don't have the same database."},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"They don't use the same infrastructure,"},"516":{"dur":5,"text":"and so it becomes really

time,"},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"it has one single truth."},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"So we can create that using blockchains."},"556":{"dur":5,"text":"We can create a decentralized database\nthat has the same efficiency of a monopoly"},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"without actually creating\nthat central authority."},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"So all of these vendors,\nall sorts of companies,"},"568":{"dur":3,"text":"can interact using the same database\nwithout trusting one another."},"574":{"dur":3,"text":"It means for consumers,\nwe can have a lot more transparency."},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"As a real-world object travels along,"},"579":{"dur":5,"text":"we can see its digital certificate\nor token move on the blockchain,"},"584":{"dur":1,"text":"adding value as it goes."},"588":{"dur":3,"text":"This is a whole new world\nin terms of our visibility."},"593":{"dur":4,"text":"So I've talked about how

trades,\nlike in a supply chain."},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"The last uncertainty that we often face"},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"is one of the most open-ended,\nand it's reneging."},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"What if you don't send me the smartphone?"},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"Can I get my money back?"},"617":{"dur":3,"text":"Blockchains allow us to write code,"},"621":{"dur":1,"text":"binding contracts,"},"623":{"dur":1,"text":"between individuals"},"624":{"dur":3,"text":"and then guarantee\nthat those contracts will bear out"},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"without a third party enforcer."},"631":{"dur":3,"text":"So if we look at the smartphone example,\nyou could think about escrow."},"635":{"dur":2,"text":"You are financing

phone."},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"I think this is one\nof the most exciting ways"},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"that blockchains lower our uncertainties,"},"651":{"dur":1,"text":"because it means to some degree"},"653":{"dur":3,"text":"we can collapse institutions\nand their enforcement."},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"It means a lot of human economic activity"},"662":{"dur":5,"text":"can get collateralized

blockchain."},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"I think what would probably\nfloor Douglass North"},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"about this use of technology"},"681":{"dur":3,"text":"is the fact that the very thing\nthat makes it work,"},"684":{"dur":4,"text":"the very thing that keeps the blockchain\nsecure and verified,"},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"is our mutual distrust."},"693":{"dur":3,"text":"So rather than all of our uncertainties"},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"slowing us down"},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"and requiring institutions"},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"like banks, our governments,\nour corporations,"},"705":{"dur":4,"text":"we can actually harness\nall of that collective uncertainty"},"709":{"dur":5,"text":"and use it to collaborate and exchange\nmore and faster and more open."},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, I don't want you\nto get the impression"},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"that the blockchain\nis the solution to everything,"},"721":{"dur":4,"text":"even though the media

are tons of people\nworking on this,"},"751":{"dur":1,"text":"from financial institutions"},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"to technology companies,\nstart-ups and universities."},"756":{"dur":4,"text":"And one of the reasons is\nthat it's not just an economic evolution."},"761":{"dur":3,"text":"It's also an innovation\nin computer science."},"769":{"dur":3,"text":"Blockchains give us\nthe technological

assets,"},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"even of our own personal attributes,"},"784":{"dur":1,"text":"in a totally new way."},"787":{"dur":1,"text":"So in some ways,"},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"they become a technological institution"},"791":{"dur":1,"text":"that has a lot of the benefits"},"793":{"dur":3,"text":"of the traditional institutions\nwe're used to using in society,"},"798":{"dur":2,"text":"but it does this in a decentralized way."},"802":{"dur":3,"text":"It does this by converting\na lot of our uncertainties"},"805":{"dur":1,"text":"into certainties."},"808":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think we

works?"},"860":{"dur":1,"text":"But you use it every day,"},"862":{"dur":3,"text":"so I think we're sort of facing\nthe same John Sculley idea"},"866":{"dur":3,"text":"of technology should either be\ninvisible or beautiful,"},"870":{"dur":3,"text":"and blockchain is kind of\nneither of those things right now,"},"873":{"dur":3,"text":"so it's better suited\nfor either really early
