a\nlittle village on the border"},"74":{"dur":1,"text":"of Kenya and Uganda."},"76":{"dur":3,"text":"He had fled the northern\narea of the country years"},"79":{"dur":2,"text":"earlier, because a

would"},"93":{"dur":1,"text":"have looked at Patrick's\nlife and thought,"},"95":{"dur":2,"text":"the situation is hopeless,\nthis person is hopeless."},"97":{"dur":2,"text":"But Patrick didn't believe that."},"100":{"dur":3,"text":"He knew that he had\nwithin themselves"},"103":{"dur":3,"text":"what it took to improve his\nlife and to lift himself up out"},"107":{"dur":2,"text":"And so one day, as he\ndescribed the story to me,"},"110":{"dur":2,"text":"he was sitting, kind of leaning\nagainst the mud structure"},"113":{"dur":2,"text":"where he and his\nbrother slept, and he"},"115":{"dur":2,"text":"was thinking, as he did every\nday, about what his plan was"},"118":{"dur":2,"text":"going to be to feed\nhimself and his brother."},"120":{"dur":2,"text":"And he sort of had\nthis aha moment."},"122":{"dur":3,"text":"He kind of looked down where\nhis hand was touching the earth"},"125":{"dur":1,"text":"and he began to dig."},"127":{"dur":5,"text":"And at first, when he dug,\nhe didn't discover too much,"},"133":{"dur":2,"text":"but he got a piece of\nwood and a scrap of metal,"},"135":{"dur":1,"text":"and started to kind\nof use these homemade"},"137":{"dur":2,"text":"implements to dig deeper,\nand he found clay deposits."},"140":{"dur":2,"text":"And he learned, as\nhe dug, that if he"},"142":{"dur":2,"text":"mixed a little bit of water with\nthat clay, it could be shaped."},"145":{"dur":3,"text":"And so he created these bricks,\njust with his own two hands."},"148":{"dur":2,"text":"The first bricks were\nreally rough and misshapen,"},"150":{"dur":2,"text":"and kind of crumbled\neasily, but he kept at it."},"153":{"dur":1,"text":"He got better and\nbetter, and soon he"},"154":{"dur":2,"text":"made bricks that were good\nenough, high quality enough,"},"157":{"dur":1,"text":"Just for fractions\nof a penny each,"},"159":{"dur":1,"text":"but it was enough\nto get started."},"161":{"dur":1,"text":"So he did that."},"162":{"dur":3,"text":"Sold those bricks and saved up."},"165":{"dur":1,"text":"And eventually,\nhe was able to buy"},"167":{"dur":3,"text":"a brick mould, which instantly\ndoubled his production."},"170":{"dur":1,"text":"He was able to make\nbricks that were"},"172":{"dur":3,"text":"more smoothly and\nconsistently shaped and sized."},"175":{"dur":1,"text":"And he dried those\nbricks in the sun,"},"177":{"dur":1,"text":"because that's what was free."},"178":{"dur":1,"text":"That's what he knew how to do."},"180":{"dur":2,"text":"And those bricks sold\nfor a little bit more"},"182":{"dur":2,"text":"than the other ones that\nhe had just made by hand."},"185":{"dur":1,"text":"You can see where this goes."},"186":{"dur":1,"text":"He continued to save up money."},"188":{"dur":2,"text":"He knew that if he baked\nthe bricks in a kiln,"},"190":{"dur":1,"text":"they would sell for even more."},"191":{"dur":1,"text":"So of course, he saved\nup to be able to go"},"192":{"dur":2,"text":"to a neighboring village and to\nlearn, and kind of apprentice"},"195":{"dur":1,"text":"for a little while,\nwith the brickmaker"},"197":{"dur":2,"text":"there and learn how to\nmake a self-contained kiln."},"199":{"dur":2,"text":"So he did that, baked the\nbricks, and of course,"},"201":{"dur":1,"text":"those sold for more."},"203":{"dur":1,"text":"And eventually, he\nwas able to replace"},"205":{"dur":2,"text":"those homemade implements\nwith a shovel, and a trowel,"},"207":{"dur":3,"text":"and other things to be much more\nof an official business person,"},"211":{"dur":0,"text":"as a brickmaker."},"212":{"dur":2,"text":"He was able to hire his brother,\nand then a neighbor, and then"},"215":{"dur":1,"text":"another, and by the\ntime I met Patrick,"},"217":{"dur":2,"text":"he had this booming business,\nwas doing quite well,"},"219":{"dur":1,"text":"and was a real leader\nin his community."},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"And perhaps, at least\nto me, most notably,"},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"he showed me were sort of\nthis epiphany had happened,"},"227":{"dur":1,"text":"and also showed me\nthe home next to it"},"228":{"dur":1,"text":"that he had built the new home."},"229":{"dur":1,"text":"Not just the old\npacked mud home,"},"231":{"dur":1,"text":"but the new one with\nbaked mud bricks"},"233":{"dur":4,"text":"that he had pulled from the\nearth with his own two hands."},"237":{"dur":2,"text":"If that's not entrepreneurial,\nI'm not sure what it is."},"240":{"dur":3,"text":"The second story I'll\ntell you is of Fatuma."},"244":{"dur":3,"text":"Now Fatuma, I met\nabout 700 miles-ish"},"247":{"dur":2,"text":"due south of where\nI met Patrick."},"249":{"dur":2,"text":"Fatuma lived in a village\noutside of Dodoma, Tanzania,"},"252":{"dur":2,"text":"and she was also\nan entrepreneur."},"255":{"dur":3,"text":"But her story ended a little bit\ndifferently than Patrick's had."},"258":{"dur":4,"text":"So to kind of tell you why I\nwas there in the first place,"},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"I was working for several months\nwith a nonprofit organization"},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"called Village Enterprise, a\ngreat bay area nonprofit that"},"268":{"dur":2,"text":"provided, at the time,\nmicrogrants of $100"},"270":{"dur":2,"text":"to entrepreneurs so\nthey could start or grow"},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"their simple businesses."},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"Patrick and Fatuma were\ntwo of these entrepreneurs,"},"278":{"dur":1,"text":"and I was there sort of\nsurveying them, interviewing"},"280":{"dur":1,"text":"them, asking them, did\nyou receive the money?"},"281":{"dur":1,"text":"If you did, how did it work?"},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"Did it change the trajectory\nof your business at all?"},"285":{"dur":1,"text":"Did it improve your life?"},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was doing this sort\nof standard of living survey"},"289":{"dur":2,"text":"and had a questionnaire that\nI would ask entrepreneur"},"291":{"dur":0,"text":"after entrepreneur."},"292":{"dur":3,"text":"So these are just two of\nthe 150-ish entrepreneurs"},"295":{"dur":3,"text":"I met during that period\nof time, 10 years ago."},"298":{"dur":2,"text":"Fatuma kind of pulled\nme into her home,"},"300":{"dur":3,"text":"and who here has been\ninside of a mud hut before?"},"303":{"dur":0,"text":"I'm going to guess some."},"304":{"dur":0,"text":"There you go."},"305":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think they're\ntotally fascinating."},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"I am sure that I could\nnever build one myself,"},"310":{"dur":3,"text":"but I kind of really love\nlooking at the structures."},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is not\nactually-- I didn't"},"315":{"dur":1,"text":"get pictures of her and\nher home at the time,"},"316":{"dur":1,"text":"but this is not\nactually her home."},"317":{"dur":2,"text":"And it looked a little bit\nlike this on the outside,"},"320":{"dur":3,"text":"and on the inside, some of\nthe nicest homes like this"},"323":{"dur":1,"text":"that I've been in\nlooked like this."},"324":{"dur":4,"text":"With actual furniture,\ndifferent implements,"},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"quite a nice\nbrightly lit inside."},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"But Fatuma's looked\na lot more like this"},"333":{"dur":1,"text":"So imagine, she pulls\nme in, sits me down"},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"in one of the few pieces\nof furniture in her home."},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"There was two folding chairs\nand a little table, and then"},"340":{"dur":3,"text":"the mattress where she's slept,\nand that was pretty much it."},"343":{"dur":1,"text":"So she pulled me\nin, sat down, and we"},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"started to talk about her\nbusiness, which was a charcoal"},"347":{"dur":0,"text":"selling business."},"348":{"dur":1,"text":"And she showed me the\nrecords that she had kept"},"350":{"dur":1,"text":"in these little blue books."},"351":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, does anyone have a visceral\nmemory when I talk about this?"},"354":{"dur":1,"text":"Blue books."},"355":{"dur":0,"text":"Right?"},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"Like the things, that least I\nused to write my middle school"},"359":{"dur":0,"text":"essays in and stuff."},"360":{"dur":1,"text":"So she had blue books."},"361":{"dur":1,"text":"Kind of funny."},"362":{"dur":3,"text":"And kept her records in there,\nand as we went through them,"},"366":{"dur":3,"text":"I got really excited,\nbecause her business was"},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"doing much better than a lot\nof the businesses I had seen,"},"372":{"dur":1,"text":"even those that were\nquite successful."},"374":{"dur":1,"text":"And I thought I had\ndiscovered this sort of rags"},"376":{"dur":2,"text":"I got really excited, I\ndouble-checked her numbers,"},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"looked, not only at that little\nblue book full of records,"},"381":{"dur":0,"text":"but other ones."},"382":{"dur":3,"text":"And in fact, her numbers\npanned out, they were correct."},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"But I was baffled\nbecause as I asked her"},"388":{"dur":2,"text":"the kind of questions that I had\nbeen asking many entrepreneurs"},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"up until that point, like,\nhow have you reinvested"},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"the profits of your business\nback into the business,"},"395":{"dur":1,"text":"or how have you improved\nyour life thanks"},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"to these new profits?"},"399":{"dur":2,"text":"I didn't see\nanything that told me"},"401":{"dur":1,"text":"that she was\nactually reinvesting"},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"in herself or in her family."},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"Her clothes were\ntattered, her shoes"},"405":{"dur":1,"text":"were kind of falling apart."},"407":{"dur":4,"text":"She was very gaunt, barely\nate three meals a day."},"411":{"dur":2,"text":"And basically, there was\nnothing that I could see,"},"414":{"dur":1,"text":"no signs of newfound\nwealth in her home."},"415":{"dur":3,"text":"So I asked her directly\nand she said things like,"},"419":{"dur":4,"text":"oh, it's fine, you\nknow, my days will pass."},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"She was very, content is\nnot quite the right word,"},"427":{"dur":3,"text":"but she had no dreams to\ndo anything with her money."},"430":{"dur":3,"text":"And I pushed her on it\nand I said, OK, fine,"},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"but where actually did\nyou put all this money,"},"436":{"dur":1,"text":"because you should have\nkind of a nice pile"},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"somewhere if what you're\ntelling me is correct?"},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"And she was kind of a joker."},"441":{"dur":3,"text":"She kind of looked around\nas if anyone else was there,"},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"and like tiptoed over to\nthe far side of her hut"},"447":{"dur":4,"text":"and patted the ground, and she\nsaid, it's in the world bank."},"451":{"dur":1,"text":"Which was kind of funny."},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, you don't\nget a lot of jokes"},"454":{"dur":1,"text":"when you're looking\nat, you know,"},"456":{"dur":1,"text":"very impoverished situations."},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"There's not a lot of\npoverty jokes out there."},"459":{"dur":1,"text":"But she thought\nthat was so funny."},"461":{"dur":1,"text":"I laughed, it was funny."},"462":{"dur":1,"text":"She had literally\nburied her money"},"464":{"dur":4,"text":"in the grounds, in the earth\nfloor next to where she slept."},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"That's what made her feel safe."},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"That's what made her feel good."},"472":{"dur":1,"text":"She didn't have real\ndreams for the future"},"474":{"dur":1,"text":"and she certainly\nhadn't reinvested"},"476":{"dur":4,"text":"much at all back into her\nlife to make things better."},"481":{"dur":1,"text":"Every other\nentrepreneur that I met"},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"did have that,\nalmost all of them."},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"They had these amazing\ndreams for the future"},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"and I have a long list of\nthings that I heard about"},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"as I asked individuals, not\nonly what they had done already."},"491":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, send their\ndaughters to school,"},"493":{"dur":1,"text":"afford three meals a\nday, buy a mosquito net,"},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"all sorts of things."},"496":{"dur":1,"text":"They had many other\ndreams for the future."},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, travels to faraway\nplaces, new clothing,"},"501":{"dur":4,"text":"shiny electronics, education\nfor all of their children,"},"505":{"dur":0,"text":"and on and on."},"506":{"dur":1,"text":"But Fatima did not."},"508":{"dur":3,"text":"And since that day, I've sort\nof been fascinated by a number"},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"things, but especially,\nI've been fascinated"},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"by this question, what makes\nsome people dig, and find"},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"opportunity literally in the\nground beneath their feet,"},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"and what makes some people\nbury the gifts that they have,"},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"the treasures that they do that?"},"524":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't think that\nthe answer to that"},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"is unrelated to\nentrepreneurship."},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"I do believe Fatuma\nwas an entrepreneur,"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"but I think the main\ndifference between her"},"533":{"dur":1,"text":"and Patrick and the\nmany, many others"},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"like Patrick who had really\njust big dreams what was next."},"538":{"dur":1,"text":"I think the main\ndifference between them"},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"was that Patrick was able to\nimagine a different future."},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"He had a very strong vision\nfor what was out there for him."},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"What could make his life\nbetter and the lives"},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"of people around him better."},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"He had this vision and\nhe wasn't afraid to keep"},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"pursuing that vision,\nalong the path,"},"553":{"dur":1,"text":"even when it got difficult."},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"I think this has to do with\nentrepreneurship, at least"},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"in some way, because\nit speaks to,"},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"at least my favorite\ndefinition of entrepreneurship,"},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"my favorite academic definition,\nwhich is Howard Stevenson's"},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"from Harvard Business School."},"567":{"dur":3,"text":"He says that entrepreneurship\nis the pursuit of opportunity,"},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"without regard to resources\ncurrently controlled."},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"And maybe I'm reading\ninto it too much,"},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"but I think it's\nquite a romantic idea."},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"That the pursuit of\nthe thing that you"},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"vision in the future, the\npursuit of this opportunity"},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"that you see to\nmake things better,"},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"without regard to what\nyou might currently"},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"have in your possession."},"587":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's about this\nmovement forward."},"589":{"dur":4,"text":"Not what you own, not your\neducation or your pedigree,"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"not a pile of resources\nyou might have at hand,"},"595":{"dur":0,"text":"at your network."},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"Just going after this\nthing and knowing"},"599":{"dur":1,"text":"that as you do that,\nyou'll find what you need,"},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"you'll make your way\nover, around, and through."},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think the best\nentrepreneurs that I've met"},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"are able to do that, because\nthey have this strong vision"},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"and they know that it's worth\nit to keep moving forward."},"610":{"dur":5,"text":"OK, so I want to now\ndigress a little bit."},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"You might ask, then, at\nleast I do, OK, great."},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"So if the thing that made\nPatrick and others so great"},"620":{"dur":1,"text":"is that they had this\nvision for the future,"},"622":{"dur":1,"text":"they were be able\nto tell themselves"},"624":{"dur":3,"text":"a story for what could be\ndifferent in the future,"},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"why don't some people do that?"},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"Why did Fatima get stuck?"},"630":{"dur":0,"text":"And others like her?"},"631":{"dur":1,"text":"And why do we?"},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"With everything\nwe need around us,"},"634":{"dur":1,"text":"why do we get stuck\nsometimes and feel"},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"like we can't move forward?"},"637":{"dur":4,"text":"I think it's because we end up\nbelieving in the wrong stories."},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I think it's really\nimportant to figure out"},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"what we're hearing and\nbelieve the right ones,"},"646":{"dur":3,"text":"champion the right ones, retell,\nperpetuate the better stories"},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"in the

buddy."},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm there on the\nleft, just kidding."},"673":{"dur":4,"text":"But I just, you know, I had\na very simple world view,"},"677":{"dur":1,"text":"as I think a lot of\nus

were"},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"in the Bible about poverty."},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"One thing she threw\nout to us was this idea"},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"that Jesus told us, what you\ndo for the least of these,"},"697":{"dur":1,"text":"you do for me."},"698":{"dur":3,"text":"And I remember hearing that, and\nas a kid it might sound silly,"},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"but as kid, it was\ndeeply

I"},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"help people that are in\nneed, if I helped the poor,"},"711":{"dur":1,"text":"then I'm doing\nsomething for God?"},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"This is like the world's\ngreatest

do\nsomething important--"},"724":{"dur":1,"text":"of cosmic importance, right?"},"726":{"dur":3,"text":"In the lives of other people."},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"At the same time, she also\nthrew things out like this,"},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"and the second thing\nthat she threw out"},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"did not give me that\nsame sort of motivation."},"737":{"dur":1,"text":"In fact, it scared\nthe pants off me."},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"She also told us that Jesus\nsaid that the poor would always"},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"be with us."},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"I pictured in my head, as

start with\nthe easy stuff."},"1867":{"dur":2,"text":"The easy challenges\nwere more up here."},"1869":{"dur":3,"text":"Like people-- In the\nvery, very beginning, when"},"1872":{"dur":2,"text":"we

to be a market for that"},"1898":{"dur":1,"text":"anyway, and there is."},"1900":{"dur":1,"text":"But that was one\nthing we got back,"},"1902":{"dur":1,"text":"so that was one\npiece of criticism"},"1903":{"dur":2,"text":"that, it's easy\nto rattle off now,"},"1906":{"dur":4,"text":"but it was a little\nbit crazy making."},"1910":{"dur":2,"text":"I think a lot happened up\nhere in the very beginning"},"1912":{"dur":2,"text":"of ventures where a\nlot of entrepreneurship"},"1915":{"dur":0,"text":"feels like make believe."},"1916":{"dur":1,"text":"You have this vision for\nthe

believe."},"1922":{"dur":2,"text":"You're trying to make the\nthing that's in your head real."},"1924":{"dur":2,"text":"And when other people tell\nyou it's silly, or impossible,"},"1927":{"dur":1,"text":"or won't work, it\ncan rattle you."},"1928":{"dur":4,"text":"So that's like the least of\nthe issues, of the challenges,"},"1932":{"dur":1,"text":"but it was something\nto overcome."},"1934":{"dur":3,"text":"There were also other challenges\nat the beginning around, which"},"1937":{"dur":2,"text":"we can all sort of giggle that\nnow, that around, you

of funny."},"1946":{"dur":5,"text":"And that was easier to fight and\nto just prove to be incorrect."},"1952":{"dur":2,"text":"The harder stuff was\nthe emotional stuff."},"1954":{"dur":4,"text":"So that picture of me with\nthe turkey, 10 years ago."},"1958":{"dur":3,"text":"During that time, I lived with a\nfamily, just for a short while,"},"1961":{"dur":4,"text":"but became really close

became"},"1973":{"dur":4,"text":"And over the first year, because\nwe had this onslaught of demand"},"1978":{"dur":3,"text":"from would-be lenders,\nI'm not to say"},"1981":{"dur":2,"text":"we created a monster because\nhe's a wonderful person,"},"1983":{"dur":1,"text":"we definitely made\nit difficult for him"},"1985":{"dur":2,"text":"and put a lot of\ntemptation in front of him."},"1987":{"dur":1,"text":"He was a pastor in\nthis small village"},"1989":{"dur":2,"text":"and it had only ever seen a\nfew thousand dollars at any one"},"1991":{"dur":0,"text":"time, if

entrepreneurs."},"1998":{"dur":2,"text":"And so there was\na case of fraud,"},"2000":{"dur":2,"text":"and it was just kind\nof heartbreaking to see"},"2002":{"dur":2,"text":"our friend make bad choices."},"2004":{"dur":4,"text":"But we were so green, and\nso, I'll use the word naive,"},"2009":{"dur":3,"text":"and had not build in the right\nsystems for accountability,"},"2012":{"dur":1,"text":"and transparency, and\nthat sort of thing."},"2014":{"dur":2,"text":"So the good part\nof that was that we"},"2017":{"dur":2,"text":"were able to respond

the\nproduct and to the site"},"2024":{"dur":1,"text":"in general have\nbeen because we've"},"2026":{"dur":4,"text":"been pushed to get better, and\nto refine, and to iterating."},"2030":{"dur":2,"text":"Sometimes, because something not\ngreat happens, but other times,"},"2033":{"dur":3,"text":"just because that's what you do."},"2036":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think the really important\npart of your questions"},"2039":{"dur":2,"text":"is, how do you get\nthrough those times?"},"2041":{"dur":2,"text":"One, I don't think it's\never really smart, at

really helped."},"2061":{"dur":2,"text":"But also, I think at some\npoint, you just need to, like,"},"2063":{"dur":3,"text":"make a choice to see\nthe good in people"},"2067":{"dur":2,"text":"and believe that it's still\nthere and believe that."},"2069":{"dur":0,"text":"It's so funny."},"2070":{"dur":3,"text":"I did-- it was really fun,\nkind of a bucket list thing"},"2073":{"dur":3,"text":"for me-- it did a forum this\nmorning with Michael Krasny,"},"2076":{"dur":0,"text":"and it was an hour."},"2077":{"dur":1,"text":"And in between\nall the breaks, he"},"2079":{"dur":2,"text":"was like pushing me on\nthe goodness of people"},"2081":{"dur":1,"text":"and he thought it was\nvery Pollyanna about it,"},"2083":{"dur":2,"text":"and we had a

I think their\nreactions to the world"},"2113":{"dur":2,"text":"aren't always forgivable,\nbut are understandable."},"2116":{"dur":1,"text":"I can see where they come from."},"2117":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think you need to choose\nto believe that we all start out"},"2120":{"dur":2,"text":"with great intentions and\nthe same common

know what\na field partner is."},"2567":{"dur":2,"text":"They have loan officers or\nother representatives that"},"2569":{"dur":2,"text":"are out there with\nborrowers, and while they"},"2571":{"dur":1,"text":"are the ones that bring\nthe information back,"},"2573":{"dur":1,"text":"it's not like the\nborrowers are typing up"},"2574":{"dur":2,"text":"their own stories at
