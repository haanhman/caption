times."},"197":{"dur":5,"text":"And in a situation like this,\nleast to my experience,"},"202":{"dur":5,"text":"one of the things that I've\nlearned is that you have to

your company."},"217":{"dur":5,"text":"And in this particular instance, I felt\nthe need to express my own views on this."},"223":{"dur":5,"text":"And that was that this country,\nthe United States,

workforce."},"301":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I was expressing that position and\nat the same time, and"},"305":{"dur":4,"text":"you asked the question, how is the CEO do\nI address this, it's very

years."},"555":{"dur":4,"text":"And if you talked to attendees this year,\nthey felt like something had tipped."},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"And whether it was heads of state or\nCEOs,
