west, the western half"},"311":{"dur":1,"text":"of the United States."},"313":{"dur":2,"text":"So I decided to dive in, and my first job was with the"},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"Arizona Department of

then"},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"the supply underneath that."},"432":{"dur":3,"text":"And there was this, the Colorado river and there was"},"436":{"dur":1,"text":"groundwater resources, and then"},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"there was this future supply."},"440":{"dur":4,"text":"And I remember looking around me, what's future supply?"},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"No one had an idea, I was like

demand."},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"California specifically, 90 percent of our water"},"502":{"dur":1,"text":"goes to agriculture."},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"This is the Colorado River and showing most of what"},"508":{"dur":4,"text":"we grow is alfalfa in the middle of the desert here."},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"At this stage, we know it's an extremely gross misuse"},"516":{"dur":4,"text":"of water,

market forces."},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"And that was really a frustrating point for me working"},"540":{"dur":1,"text":"at that planning level."},"541":{"dur":3,"text":"And everything that we did do for conservation that we"},"545":{"dur":4,"text":"communicated with our constituents and our consumer base was"},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"focused around what they use at home,"},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"a tiny sliver of the pie."},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"But we just thought that the consumer,"},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"everyday person, couldn't make those multiple"},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"connections between the water that"},"565":{"dur":3,"text":"they use, but also what they put on their plate"},"569":{"dur":1,"text":"and the water that's consumed there."},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"We didn't have that conversation"},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"when it came to conservation, because the farmers are"},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"gonna grow what they sell."},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"What sells is what we eat."},"581":{"dur":3,"text":"It was very evident that that's where the true decisions"},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"are made, is at the consumer level everyday."},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"What we decide to eat, that's what we're gonna water."},"590":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I became really excited when I learned about the"},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"concept of eating insects."},"598":{"dur":3,"text":"I have this photo up there specifically"},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"to give you an analogy."},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"We often talk about turning the tap off when you brush"},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"your teeth as a big conservation message."},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"I looked recently at the California Department of"},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"Water Resources site, I didn't see anything on their"},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"water conservation section about diet."},"619":{"dur":1,"text":"We often talk about"},"622":{"dur":1,"text":"turning off the tap when you brush"},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"your teeth, low-flow toilets et cetera."},"626":{"dur":4,"text":"But the equivalent of one hamburger to a tap when you're"},"631":{"dur":4,"text":"brushing your teeth is basically like turning the tap on,"},"635":{"dur":4,"text":"brush your teeth, keep it on, keep it running, put your"},"639":{"dur":4,"text":"toothbrush down, go to work, go to school for the day,"},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"come back at lunchtime, make sure it's"},"646":{"dur":1,"text":"still (imitates water gushing) full blast,"},"648":{"dur":3,"text":"that nobody's turned it off, go back to work or school,"},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"come back for dinner and then turn it off."},"655":{"dur":1,"text":"So all day long (imitates water gushing) that's"},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"one hamburger worth of water."},"658":{"dur":3,"text":"Yet often what we've talked about was turning it off for"},"662":{"dur":1,"text":"those microseconds."},"663":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's really where the conflict I saw was."},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"So when insects came along, I thought wow, here's"},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"a great opportunity to potentially communicate with"},"673":{"dur":4,"text":"the consumer about an incredibly efficient form of food."},"678":{"dur":4,"text":"For example, what we're mostly growing here is that alfalfa."},"683":{"dur":4,"text":"The feed to biomass ratio, this was the stat that really"},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"drove it home for me, I listened to a Ted Talk one day"},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"kind of looking through this lens of water conservation."},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you take 10 pounds of feed and you give it to a cow"},"696":{"dur":3,"text":"it grows about one pound, of that about 40 percent"},"699":{"dur":1,"text":"of it is actually edible."},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"But if you give it to locusts, they grow about eight"},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"pounds and the majority that is actually edible"},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"and that isn't just excess fiber."},"710":{"dur":4,"text":"So incredibly more efficient from the starting gate."},"714":{"dur":3,"text":"When you look at a water perspective, insects are over"},"718":{"dur":3,"text":"10 times more efficient than cattle at converting water"},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"into grams of protein."},"723":{"dur":4,"text":"And even more efficient than substitutes like soy and corn."},"727":{"dur":4,"text":"We're working on a project right now in Southeast Asia"},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"where we're feeding our insects organic"},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"banana plantation wastes."},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"So the palm fronds et cetera from banana trees, as well"},"739":{"dur":4,"text":"as palm fronds going to the insect farm and that's"},"744":{"dur":1,"text":"entirely what they eat."},"746":{"dur":1,"text":"And so it's agricultural byproduct."},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's where really the savings begin is where"},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"we take production out of our current system"},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"and essentially just plug a hole in our inefficiency"},"756":{"dur":1,"text":"of our food system."},"757":{"dur":4,"text":"These will become even greater as we continually"},"761":{"dur":3,"text":"develop the agricultural part of this."},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"And then they happen to be extremely nutritious as well."},"768":{"dur":4,"text":"The flour that we make has twice the protein of beef."},"773":{"dur":3,"text":"High in other micronutrients and it's really a"},"776":{"dur":3,"text":"standalone value proposition in and of itself."},"782":{"dur":3,"text":"Here we have a photo of a Thai market and there's"},"786":{"dur":4,"text":"some 1,600 varieties of insects eaten around the world."},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"In Thailand there's hundreds and hundreds of them"},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"if you go down to the market and see something this."},"795":{"dur":3,"text":"That's one of the parts that I really get excited about"},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"is that the potential of insects to really increase"},"802":{"dur":3,"text":"the diversity of our food supply as well."},"805":{"dur":4,"text":"Been on a pretty dangerous trend of a lack of diversity"},"809":{"dur":3,"text":"in our food supply, really monoculture style of agriculture."},"812":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's one of biggest issues I have with potential GMOs"},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"is that it's really decreasing the diversity of our"},"819":{"dur":4,"text":"food supply and it's a very poor risk management strategy."},"825":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm only here today because my ancestors 150, 200"},"831":{"dur":3,"text":"years ago were a part of the potato famine."},"834":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you wanna talk about food diversity and what"},"837":{"dur":4,"text":"it can do to a civilization, it's a great example."},"842":{"dur":4,"text":"It also is very robust at adapting to a changing climate."},"849":{"dur":4,"text":"Insects can grow in a really wide range of climates."},"853":{"dur":3,"text":"We're leaning heavily, we know that animal proteins"},"856":{"dur":2,"text":"are pretty inefficient, so we're looking pretty heavily"},"859":{"dur":3,"text":"at plant protein, but oftentimes they have a really fragile"},"862":{"dur":2,"text":"climate window that they grown in, especially"},"864":{"dur":2,"text":"some of the leading plant proteins that we're looking at"},"867":{"dur":3,"text":"like

eat them"},"898":{"dur":2,"text":"is this face right here."},"900":{"dur":1,"text":"It's purely cultural."},"902":{"dur":2,"text":"I was not the first one to come up with this idea."},"904":{"dur":2,"text":"But decade after decade, academics have"},"907":{"dur":2,"text":"been saying makes sense for all these reasons,"},"910":{"dur":2,"text":"but people won't accept it,"},"912":{"dur":2,"text":"but our culture isn't ready for it."},"914":{"dur":4,"text":"So in 2012 we decided to question that assumption"},"920":{"dur":1,"text":"and challenge that assumption essentially,"},"922":{"dur":1,"text":"and see if people were ready for it."},"923":{"dur":3,"text":"And challenge that cultural component of it."},"928":{"dur":4,"text":"Luckily for us, there's plenty of other examples of"},"933":{"dur":2,"text":"remarketing essentially of cultural biases around"},"936":{"dur":3,"text":"food products and this is an example, lobster."},"940":{"dur":4,"text":"They were considered this complete junk fish or junk food."},"945":{"dur":4,"text":"They would just wash up on the Eastern Seaboard en masse"},"950":{"dur":2,"text":"and just rot on the beaches."},"953":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, in the 1930's New York State Penitentiary"},"957":{"dur":4,"text":"made it illegal to feed inmates lobster more than"},"961":{"dur":3,"text":"three days a week because it was considered inhumane"},"964":{"dur":1,"text":"treatment of the inmates."},"965":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughing)"},"967":{"dur":1,"text":"And now it went through a very concerted

the leader embraces him as an equal."},"1749":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's not about the leader anymore,"},"1751":{"dur":1,"text":"it's about them, plural."},"1753":{"dur":2,"text":"Notice how he's

all"},"1834":{"dur":2,"text":"alone, remember the importance of nurturing your first"},"1837":{"dur":3,"text":"few followers as equals, making everything clearly"},"1840":{"dur":2,"text":"about the movement not you."},"1843":{"dur":2,"text":"Be public, be easy to follow."},"1845":{"dur":3,"text":"But the biggest lesson here, did you catch it?"},"1849":{"dur":2,"text":"Leadership is

happened."},"1858":{"dur":3,"text":"It was the first follower that transformed a lone nut"},"1861":{"dur":1,"text":"into a leader."},"1863":{"dur":3,"text":"There's no movement without the first

going"},"2413":{"dur":1,"text":"into it during your speech."},"2415":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'm just wondering what role to you think GMOs will"},"2418":{"dur":2,"text":"or will not play in the

here."},"2431":{"dur":4,"text":"I, so as a scientist there's relatively few absolutes,"},"2437":{"dur":4,"text":"but I think one absolute is that diversity equals health."},"2442":{"dur":3,"text":"And so anything that infringes upon the diversity"},"2446":{"dur":1,"text":"deteriorates the health."},"2447":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I think that's my biggest issue with them is that"},"2450":{"dur":3,"text":"if we're looking at it from a risk management perspective,"},"2454":{"dur":3,"text":"we absolutely need a wider variety and it will be harder"},"2458":{"dur":3,"text":"to control from a single organization."},"2462":{"dur":2,"text":"But I don't think that's a bad thing especially"},"2464":{"dur":2,"text":"when it comes to our food

this science is completely"},"2481":{"dur":1,"text":"is undebatable"},"2482":{"dur":2,"text":"whether it does maximize productivity or not."},"2485":{"dur":2,"text":"I think the argument is still on the table as far"},"2488":{"dur":3,"text":"increasing our productivity from a GMO perspective."},"2491":{"dur":4,"text":"On reason why I feed my crickets non-GMO, organic

Europe,"},"2520":{"dur":1,"text":"but here it's very market-driven."},"2522":{"dur":2,"text":"Whole Foods has decided they're not gonna have any"},"2524":{"dur":2,"text":"GMO products in their stores, and that wasn't regulated."},"2527":{"dur":2,"text":"That was pure consumer driven."},"2529":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I get excited about the momentum that"},"2533":{"dur":1,"text":"that can create."},"2534":{"dur":3,"text":"But it's a complicated argument, yeah."},"2540":{"dur":3,"text":"As far as health concerns, I don't think there's"},"2543":{"dur":1,"text":"anything substantiated."},"2544":{"dur":2,"text":"There's no evidence that there should be a individual"},"2547":{"dur":4,"text":"health concern, whether you wanna be the guinea pig

talk."},"2562":{"dur":2,"text":"Something I understand the problem with the lack of"},"2564":{"dur":2,"text":"efficiency in a lot of the food sources now."},"2567":{"dur":2,"text":"But something that I personally have a problem with is"},"2570":{"dur":2,"text":"the industrial agricultural complex."},"2572":{"dur":4,"text":"And I understand that your product is made by you"},"2577":{"dur":1,"text":"in small quantities."},"2578":{"dur":4,"text":"But looking, and I've read a lot into the insects food"},"2583":{"dur":1,"text":"source, you know you can raise them at home and then"},"2585":{"dur":1,"text":"you can eat them."},"2586":{"dur":3,"text":"But looking at it logically, it seems like that food"},"2590":{"dur":4,"text":"source would be the most easy to industrialize in terms"},"2594":{"dur":3,"text":"of having massive farms with all these insects."},"2599":{"dur":4,"text":"And my family are actually cowboys out in Nebraska"},"2604":{"dur":4,"text":"and they have a ranch with a 1000 cattle and they breed"},"2609":{"dur":1,"text":"the cattle, they slaughter them."},"2610":{"dur":2,"text":"We have a restaurant, we sell it there and it's like"},"2613":{"dur":3,"text":"I really like the idea that American farmers and"},"2616":{"dur":2,"text":"American ranchers can bring something"},"2619":{"dur":2,"text":"from the farm to the table."},"2621":{"dur":2,"text":"And I just struggle to see that happening on a"},"2624":{"dur":3,"text":"large scale with the insect protein products."},"2630":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm just curious what you think about that and like"},"2631":{"dur":2,"text":"the future and how you can kind of maintain"},"2634":{"dur":4,"text":"that style of agriculture with this in your food source."},"2640":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yeah, that's very insightful"},"2644":{"dur":1,"text":"vision of it."},"2647":{"dur":4,"text":"Yeah, there's a difference in mammal husbandry and"},"2652":{"dur":1,"text":"in avian husbandry"},"2654":{"dur":2,"text":"in that the real impacts"},"2657":{"dur":1,"text":"from a waste perspective, are"},"2659":{"dur":2,"text":"it's a pretty easy equation"},"2662":{"dur":2,"text":"as far as just population density."},"2665":{"dur":4,"text":"If you have range-fed cattle it's completely different"},"2669":{"dur":4,"text":"than a CAFO, in a confined agricultural feed lot."},"2677":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a tipping point where you just have too many"},"2680":{"dur":2,"text":"bodies per unit of area."},"2683":{"dur":2,"text":"Insects is a little different because they naturally"},"2686":{"dur":3,"text":"have these dense populations, and you can raise them"},"2689":{"dur":2,"text":"convertically and that's one of the efficiencies of"},"2691":{"dur":1,"text":"them from that land perspective."},"2693":{"dur":4,"text":"But that is a very valid concern that you could potentially"},"2698":{"dur":1,"text":"industrialize them."},"2701":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that"},"2705":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't need to have complete ownership of the"},"2709":{"dur":3,"text":"industry from start to finish, I just need to get"},"2713":{"dur":3,"text":"it started and have faith that it will continue to"},"2717":{"dur":1,"text":"go in good directions."},"2720":{"dur":1,"text":"One of the benefits of them, is that they can be grown"},"2722":{"dur":4,"text":"in an urban environment and that by nature limits"},"2727":{"dur":1,"text":"the expansion of them."},"2729":{"dur":3,"text":"There's a couple really cool projects."},"2732":{"dur":2,"text":"They're looking into abandoned warehouses in Detroit"},"2734":{"dur":3,"text":"right now and converting them into insect farms."},"2738":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think that the efficiency will really be driven"},"2741":{"dur":4,"text":"by looking at it from a macro view of the efficiency"},"2747":{"dur":4,"text":"of the food transportation and getting it from farm"},"2752":{"dur":3,"text":"to fork as you say, where you just can't do that when"},"2755":{"dur":2,"text":"it's industrialized offsite."},"2759":{"dur":3,"text":"So I don't have a clear answer for you as far as what"},"2762":{"dur":2,"text":"will be done to prevent mass"},"2765":{"dur":3,"text":"industrialization of insect farming."},"2769":{"dur":3,"text":"I think it sort of reminds me of a Wendell Berry"},"2772":{"dur":4,"text":"quote of like, we don't have the right to speculate"},"2780":{"dur":2,"text":"whether this is gonna work or not."},"2783":{"dur":3,"text":"We just have the right to know what is good today and take"},"2786":{"dur":3,"text":"actionable steps towards doing that in our own lives."},"2789":{"dur":3,"text":"So I don't know if that was much of an answer for you."},"2793":{"dur":1,"text":"(audience member speaks off microphone)"},"2794":{"dur":1,"text":"yeah, you're welcome."},"2795":{"dur":1,"text":"(student speaks off

dunno."},"2806":{"dur":3,"text":"We're far from that right now, I'll tell you that much."},"2809":{"dur":1,"text":"We have a long way to go"},"2811":{"dur":4,"text":"with consumer perception (laughing)."},"2815":{"dur":3,"text":"I remember diving into water, I had this big view of"},"2819":{"dur":1,"text":"the species and whatnot."},"2821":{"dur":2,"text":"And really, you have to

single"},"2832":{"dur":2,"text":"solution to a lot of these issues we're facing."},"2835":{"dur":3,"text":"And you just have to have faith that your colleagues"},"2838":{"dur":2,"text":"around you are

this?"},"2855":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay, that's weird, sorry."},"2857":{"dur":2,"text":"So I have the wonderful experience of being able"},"2860":{"dur":2,"text":"to work with butterflies and moths all the time."},"2862":{"dur":1,"text":"So one of my real concerns, one of the reasons why"},"2864":{"dur":2,"text":"I wanted to come to this talk is this general abhorrence"},"2867":{"dur":4,"text":"of insects in our culture and try to overcome that."},"2871":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I was wondering if you thought it was possible"},"2874":{"dur":3,"text":"that in expanding insects into our Western food culture"},"2878":{"dur":3,"text":"would also be a way for us to expand awareness of the"},"2881":{"dur":1,"text":"insects around us and how that"},"2883":{"dur":3,"text":"might relate to conservation efforts?"},"2889":{"dur":1,"text":"- That's fascinating."},"2894":{"dur":2,"text":"Good question, so the question if you didn't hear."},"2897":{"dur":4,"text":"How can our crusade about public perception around"},"2901":{"dur":2,"text":"eating insects potentially raise awareness for"},"2904":{"dur":2,"text":"conservation of insect populations in general."},"2907":{"dur":1,"text":"Is that a good summary?"},"2910":{"dur":4,"text":"Yeah, there's huge issues, whether it's our honeybees."},"2915":{"dur":2,"text":"I dunno, that one's yours."},"2918":{"dur":1,"text":"How can they raise awareness?"},"2920":{"dur":0,"text":"I'm trying to think offhand of"},"2921":{"dur":2,"text":"other examples where consuming"},"2923":{"dur":2,"text":"a product has also kind of increased"},"2926":{"dur":1,"text":"the awareness of them."},"2927":{"dur":4,"text":"It's actually something that we struggle with, I should"},"2931":{"dur":1,"text":"have thrown up some pictures of our original packaging."},"2933":{"dur":4,"text":"Our original packaging background was all natural"},"2939":{"dur":3,"text":"encyclopedic drawings of insects, 'cause I was really"},"2943":{"dur":3,"text":"adamant about we're gonna educate people about their food,"},"2946":{"dur":1,"text":"and what's in it."},"2948":{"dur":3,"text":"We did some focus groups and consumer feedback,"},"2951":{"dur":2,"text":"and people did not like the look of the insect."},"2954":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I'm struggling with an answer because in some"},"2957":{"dur":4,"text":"regards people just do not want to know what they're eating."},"2965":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean we make a flour out of it for a reason,"},"2968":{"dur":3,"text":"and so people don't wanna be connected"},"2971":{"dur":3,"text":"and that's the landscape that I'm operating a package"},"2975":{"dur":4,"text":"food product in, so I put that challenge onto you."},"2980":{"dur":4,"text":"But I welcome your ideas (laughing)."},"2992":{"dur":2,"text":"- [Audience member] Hi, I really liked your talk."},"2994":{"dur":4,"text":"So my question is that you talked about how there are"},"2998":{"dur":2,"text":"barriers in different parts of the world, like Europe,"},"3001":{"dur":3,"text":"in terms of regulation, manufacturing et cetera."},"3005":{"dur":4,"text":"So do you actually see the cricket farms or insect farms"},"3009":{"dur":4,"text":"or the industry moving over to other parts of the world"},"3013":{"dur":1,"text":"in the future?"},"3015":{"dur":2,"text":"Or is this just localized to the US?"},"3017":{"dur":2,"text":"- No, it's already spreading."},"3023":{"dur":3,"text":"We were the first product in the US, but also one of"},"3026":{"dur":3,"text":"the first products in the Western world branding it as"},"3030":{"dur":2,"text":"this introduction to our culture."},"3033":{"dur":4,"text":"And there's now a cricket bar, there's a couple in the US."},"3038":{"dur":1,"text":"There's one in the UK."},"3040":{"dur":1,"text":"There's one in Finland."},"3042":{"dur":0,"text":"There's one in France."},"3043":{"dur":1,"text":"There's one in Germany."},"3044":{"dur":3,"text":"There's one in Australia, and there might be a couple,"},"3048":{"dur":1,"text":"oh, there's two in Canada."},"3050":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's already spreading at a pretty large degree."},"3053":{"dur":4,"text":"And the industry can rapidly, the biggest room for"},"3058":{"dur":3,"text":"improvement and innovation at this point is in the"},"3062":{"dur":2,"text":"agricultural side in rearing the insects, which"},"3064":{"dur":1,"text":"can be done anywhere."},"3068":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's really innovative projects"},"3070":{"dur":1,"text":"happening all over the world."},"3071":{"dur":4,"text":"South Africa is leading the way right now, I don't know"},"3075":{"dur":1,"text":"about leading, but South Africa is doing some really"},"3077":{"dur":2,"text":"innovative projects right now."},"3082":{"dur":3,"text":"The supply and demand graph I showed of the Colorado River"},"3086":{"dur":4,"text":"is a later term issue when you look at India's water"},"3090":{"dur":1,"text":"and the Middle East."},"3093":{"dur":2,"text":"These are issues that happened long ago"},"3095":{"dur":1,"text":"as far as the over-consumption."},"3097":{"dur":3,"text":"The groundwater reserves in India specifically"},"3100":{"dur":3,"text":"are dire right now, they're vary shallow"},"3104":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's the fastest melting glacier in the world,"},"3107":{"dur":1,"text":"the Himalayan glacier."},"3108":{"dur":1,"text":"And so their base flow for the majority"},"3110":{"dur":2,"text":"of their surface water's diminishing."},"3112":{"dur":3,"text":"These are big issues around the world and so everyone"},"3116":{"dur":1,"text":"is looking at: Where are we gonna get our water?"},"3118":{"dur":1,"text":"Where are we gonna get our food?"},"3119":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think that, in part, that United Nations report"},"3123":{"dur":1,"text":"really put it on the map."},"3124":{"dur":3,"text":"And so there's some pretty cool projects happening"},"3127":{"dur":1,"text":"all over the world."},"3130":{"dur":3,"text":"We're just playing our role in it, especially coming"},"3133":{"dur":2,"text":"from the marketing side."},"3136":{"dur":3,"text":"Being that the innovation will happen at that agricultural"},"3140":{"dur":3,"text":"level, and it's an exciting thing is that it can happen"},"3144":{"dur":3,"text":"quickly and it can be remote and you can transport these"},"3148":{"dur":3,"text":"they're not tied to a specific field."},"3151":{"dur":1,"text":"They have really short lifespans."},"3153":{"dur":4,"text":"You can see an evolution within in their own species too."},"3157":{"dur":3,"text":"Yeah, it is by no means limited to the US."},"3166":{"dur":2,"text":"- [Audience member] Thank you very much for your talk."},"3168":{"dur":0,"text":"- Welcome."},"3169":{"dur":1,"text":"- I'd like to ask about at the"},"3170":{"dur":2,"text":"beginning you were talking about the water inefficiency"},"3173":{"dur":2,"text":"of the cattle and a lot of other types of meat."},"3175":{"dur":2,"text":"And one solution to that is crickets."},"3178":{"dur":3,"text":"But another potential solution is vegetarianism."},"3182":{"dur":4,"text":"And that faces it's own branding PR type

same"},"3195":{"dur":2,"text":"advertising cloud as McDonald's."},"3198":{"dur":4,"text":"But I was wondering if you could talk a bit about"},"3203":{"dur":2,"text":"whether you see vegetarianism as

just talk more about that."},"3214":{"dur":2,"text":"Appreciate it, thank you."},"3217":{"dur":0,"text":"- Lentils."},"3218":{"dur":2,"text":"(laughing)"},"3221":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm mostly a vegetarian."},"3225":{"dur":4,"text":"Like I said earlier, we need a variety of solutions."},"3230":{"dur":3,"text":"And absolutely more plant-based diet."},"3233":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, wholeheartedly, but increase the diversity"},"3237":{"dur":2,"text":"within the plant spectrum as well."},"3243":{"dur":3,"text":"The main argument of why not just plants."},"3246":{"dur":1,"text":"Why do we need to bring insects?"},"3247":{"dur":2,"text":"I think really that's where the void"},"3250":{"dur":2,"text":"the insects fill that plants don't"},"3252":{"dur":4,"text":"is their adaptability to changes in the environment."},"3257":{"dur":1,"text":"And so I have to lead with that."},"3258":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm not critical of plants necessarily, but absolutely"},"3263":{"dur":2,"text":"we need a more plant-focused protein diet,"},"3266":{"dur":2,"text":"especially in Western worlds."},"3270":{"dur":1,"text":"So what was the second part of that?"},"3271":{"dur":3,"text":"I just need to be clear, that I love lentils,"},"3276":{"dur":0,"text":"love lentils."},"3277":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughing)"},"3278":{"dur":0,"text":"- [Audience member] Yeah, I think you answered"},"3279":{"dur":0,"text":"most of it."},"3280":{"dur":1,"text":"I was just wondering about whether you see vegetarianism"},"3282":{"dur":1,"text":"as a potential avenue."},"3283":{"dur":4,"text":"- Yeah, yeah, there's some really cool projects right now."},"3288":{"dur":4,"text":"There's a really fascinating article in Pacific Standard"},"3295":{"dur":3,"text":"of how Beyond Meat has gotten meat to bleed."},"3299":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't know if anyone's seen that, so it's something"},"3302":{"dur":4,"text":"with extracting I think it some bean isolate and then they"},"3307":{"dur":2,"text":"put it into yeast and they've been"},"3310":{"dur":1,"text":"able to create hemoglobin."},"3311":{"dur":4,"text":"And so they actually make this plant-based meat bleed."},"3317":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't know if that's the solution."},"3318":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm really suspicious of mimicking meat, because"},"3323":{"dur":3,"text":"there are so many just phenomenal plant-based meals that"},"3327":{"dur":3,"text":"don't have to pretend to be something else."},"3330":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that's my biggest issue, is that if you're"},"3332":{"dur":2,"text":"pretending to be something else, you'll never"},"3334":{"dur":1,"text":"achieve that status."},"3336":{"dur":3,"text":"So I don't

today."},"3574":{"dur":1,"text":"I had a question about your audience"},"3576":{"dur":1,"text":"and your target audience."},"3578":{"dur":3,"text":"So I know you spoke a little bit about you adding"},"3581":{"dur":4,"text":"organic and making it non-GMO for a certain people who"},"3586":{"dur":2,"text":"like organic food and nature food."},"3588":{"dur":2,"text":"But I was wondering, have you ever thought about targeting"},"3590":{"dur":2,"text":"sports people, people who really care about protein,"},"3593":{"dur":3,"text":"and really need that to replenish themselves"},"3596":{"dur":1,"text":"after games and such?"},"3599":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, I mean that's one reason why we"},"3601":{"dur":1,"text":"started with an energy bar."},"3603":{"dur":3,"text":"So, let me take a couple steps back, so when you start"},"3606":{"dur":3,"text":"a business, you need to do market research on who's gonna"},"3610":{"dur":1,"text":"consume your product."},"3612":{"dur":2,"text":"There was no market for us to research when we started."},"3614":{"dur":1,"text":"So it was all just a guess."},"3616":{"dur":2,"text":"It's very contrary to business 101."},"3622":{"dur":3,"text":"So we thought that the most receptive audience would be"},"3626":{"dur":2,"text":"people that are active in the outdoors."},"3629":{"dur":3,"text":"That would like to protect the environment with which they"},"3632":{"dur":3,"text":"recreate in and so that's why we created energy

consumption."},"3642":{"dur":1,"text":"That was our assumption we made."},"3644":{"dur":3,"text":"I think we are finding now through, and then we just,"},"3648":{"dur":3,"text":"splattered it all around, so like bike shops,"},"3651":{"dur":3,"text":"like natural food store, museum, everywhere that we could"},"3654":{"dur":2,"text":"we just sold it so that we could get feedback on where"},"3657":{"dur":4,"text":"it was doing well, what demographics was it selling well in."},"3663":{"dur":3,"text":"What we're learning is that, yeah, that very protein-focused"},"3667":{"dur":2,"text":"athlete is adopting it faster"},"3669":{"dur":3,"text":"than our outdoor recreationalist that we assumed."},"3673":{"dur":2,"text":"Turns out, people that live in the van and rock climb"},"3676":{"dur":2,"text":"don't want to pay three dollars for an energy bar."},"3678":{"dur":2,"text":"(laughing)"},"3680":{"dur":3,"text":"But yeah, the quality of the

essential amino acids and so that's why we're"},"3691":{"dur":1,"text":"just kind of tailoring new products."},"3693":{"dur":3,"text":"And so our business model was to be adaptable"},"3697":{"dur":3,"text":"to feedback that we received as we go along."},"3707":{"dur":2,"text":"- [Audience member] Hi I'm wondering, just sort"},"3710":{"dur":1,"text":"an easy question (laughing)."},"3712":{"dur":2,"text":"- [Audience member woman] You've gotten some difficult ones."},"3715":{"dur":1,"text":"Does the flour, the cricket flour, function in the same"},"3717":{"dur":2,"text":"way that rice or wheat flour functions?"},"3719":{"dur":2,"text":"So can you make cookies and bread?"},"3722":{"dur":2,"text":"And if so, how does it affect the taste"},"3725":{"dur":2,"text":"of the cookie or the bread?"},"3728":{"dur":2,"text":"- It's a protein powder."},"3730":{"dur":2,"text":"I called it cricket flour, and that's kind of the"},"3733":{"dur":3,"text":"industry term, because I was so focused on language"},"3737":{"dur":0,"text":"and perception."},"3738":{"dur":3,"text":"And I felt flour was more associated with food"},"3741":{"dur":1,"text":"than powder or meal."},"3745":{"dur":3,"text":"A more accurate definition would be cricket meal,"},"3748":{"dur":1,"text":"or cricket powder."},"3750":{"dur":4,"text":"So we sell that as a standalone product on our website."},"3755":{"dur":2,"text":"It's like 65 to 70 percent protein."},"3758":{"dur":4,"text":"We also sell a baking flour, that what you're asking about,"},"3763":{"dur":2,"text":"and so we added starches to it."},"3765":{"dur":1,"text":"So we added rice starch."},"3766":{"dur":2,"text":"And we added tapioca starch to have the binding properties"},"3769":{"dur":2,"text":"of a typical baking flour."},"3774":{"dur":2,"text":"You have to add starch to make it have those properties."},"3776":{"dur":3,"text":"The taste is kind of nutty, it's pretty mild,"},"3781":{"dur":1,"text":"kind of earthy."},"3784":{"dur":2,"text":"These are very, (laughing) who's in marketing"},"3787":{"dur":3,"text":"here that knows what I'm trying to say?"},"3790":{"dur":2,"text":"It's kind of like hemp protein, that's a bit similar."},"3792":{"dur":2,"text":"A mix between hemp and sunflower seeds."},"3795":{"dur":2,"text":"That's the closest thing."},"3801":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Audience member] So actually I have two questions."},"3802":{"dur":2,"text":"One is more for levity and a follow up for this."},"3805":{"dur":1,"text":"Have you had whole crickets?"},"3806":{"dur":3,"text":"Probably you have, and do you enjoy that?"},"3810":{"dur":3,"text":"And then a more serious question, I'm an environmental"},"3813":{"dur":4,"text":"economist and so my thought is that the foundation here"},"3818":{"dur":3,"text":"is that water is just not priced right."},"3821":{"dur":2,"text":"And one bullet point you didn't come up with was"},"3823":{"dur":3,"text":"why not just charge more for water and therefore your"},"3827":{"dur":4,"text":"competition, like beef and chicken, would raise and be"},"3831":{"dur":4,"text":"not as profitable and alternatives might be more successful?"},"3838":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yes, I have eaten a whole cricket."},"3840":{"dur":2,"text":"(laughing)"},"3844":{"dur":2,"text":"How much time do we have, a whole long story behind that."},"3847":{"dur":4,"text":"But do I enjoy it, kind of a side note, we were talking"},"3853":{"dur":4,"text":"about at the table here, I take this very seriously."},"3858":{"dur":2,"text":"I have this high-level view of our food supply"},"3861":{"dur":2,"text":"and I want this to be a serious commodity and so I was"},"3864":{"dur":4,"text":"very averse to any sort of gimmicky, novelty element"},"3869":{"dur":1,"text":"associated with it."},"3871":{"dur":3,"text":"But I'm kind of coming around on that, in that I"},"3874":{"dur":4,"text":"appreciate the fact that every time you consume an"},"3880":{"dur":3,"text":"insect it's just that much easier for whatever reason"},"3884":{"dur":1,"text":"you tried it the first time."},"3885":{"dur":3,"text":"If it was for shock value, the next time you're presented"},"3888":{"dur":2,"text":"with it, that shock is not as strong."},"3891":{"dur":2,"text":"You're able to look at it a little more logically."},"3894":{"dur":3,"text":"So I now see the merit in the novelty element of it"},"3898":{"dur":3,"text":"to some degree, and we may play with that, I'm not sure."},"3901":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm not 100 percent convinced because I'm so opposed to it."},"3906":{"dur":1,"text":"Your second question,"},"3908":{"dur":4,"text":"because I wasn't in charge of the water pricing, that's why."},"3913":{"dur":3,"text":"I remember specifically sitting at a conference"},"3916":{"dur":1,"text":"and we were talking about,"},"3918":{"dur":1,"text":"actually we were talking about"},"3919":{"dur":2,"text":"dilapidating water infrastructure."},"3921":{"dur":3,"text":"And essentially we were talking about how we're gonna"},"3925":{"dur":0,"text":"fund this."},"3926":{"dur":3,"text":"And it was something like a five dollar rate increase"},"3930":{"dur":4,"text":"to fund this mega-project to renovate our water treatment"},"3935":{"dur":3,"text":"facility and it's just assumed that that's political"},"3939":{"dur":4,"text":"suicide to propose a five dollar increase and rate hike."},"3943":{"dur":4,"text":"And so what that means to me is that it needs a much better"},"3947":{"dur":1,"text":"marketing campaign."},"3949":{"dur":2,"text":"That was this epiphany I had."},"3951":{"dur":2,"text":"Absolutely we need to charge more water for it."},"3954":{"dur":2,"text":"But if it's political suicide to propose that means"},"3956":{"dur":2,"text":"it's not being branded correctly."},"3959":{"dur":3,"text":"We don't even blink, if my cell phone bill goes up"},"3962":{"dur":2,"text":"five, 10 dollars I might not even notice it."},"3965":{"dur":3,"text":"But to be outraged over a five dollar price on my water,"},"3968":{"dur":2,"text":"we need to do a better job of marketing conservation"},"3971":{"dur":2,"text":"and marketing our natural resources"},"3975":{"dur":3,"text":"and there's plenty of creative ways to do that."},"3979":{"dur":3,"text":"Again, limitations of time and energy."},"3983":{"dur":2,"text":"But that's where I really see the need for it"},"3985":{"dur":4,"text":"because anyone that is in the position to propose that"},"3990":{"dur":4,"text":"at least in the districts I worked in nobody was willing"},"3994":{"dur":3,"text":"to risk their political career on proposing increase"},"3997":{"dur":3,"text":"in water, it's political suicide as they called it."},"4000":{"dur":1,"text":"So let's rebrand it."},"4006":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Audience member] Hi, this is just out of sheer"},"4007":{"dur":2,"text":"curiosity, I know you make the crickets into a flour"},"4010":{"dur":1,"text":"before putting them into the bars."},"4012":{"dur":1,"text":"But would you happen to know how many crickets are in"},"4014":{"dur":1,"text":"each bar approximately?"},"4016":{"dur":0,"text":"- I do."},"4019":{"dur":2,"text":"It depends on what flavor."},"4022":{"dur":1,"text":"We have four flavors."},"4024":{"dur":2,"text":"And I model them after a region of the world that eats"},"4027":{"dur":2,"text":"insects so I try to make that cultural connection."},"4029":{"dur":4,"text":"So we have a Central Mexico dark chocolate coffee"},"4034":{"dur":3,"text":"cayenne, and that one has about 20 crickets in it."},"4037":{"dur":2,"text":"Then we have a Thailand coconut ginger lime,"},"4039":{"dur":1,"text":"that one has about 30."},"4041":{"dur":3,"text":"And then the highest is a Japanese style, it's matcha"},"4044":{"dur":2,"text":"green tea, goji nori flakes and that one"},"4046":{"dur":2,"text":"has almost 40 crickets in it."},"4050":{"dur":1,"text":"It's our highest protein bar."},"4052":{"dur":2,"text":"And I actually have a couple back there."},"4054":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't know if I have one for everyone."},"4058":{"dur":3,"text":"So does anyone have an idea how to do this?"},"4062":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay meet me over there if you really want one."},"4064":{"dur":3,"text":"Yeah you want try one and pass them out?"},"4067":{"dur":0,"text":"Yeah?"},"4070":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah you can maybe just open them up"},"4072":{"dur":2,"text":"on that table over there."},"4074":{"dur":4,"text":"And if you're dying for one and you find a partner,"},"4078":{"dur":1,"text":"maybe you can share one."},"4080":{"dur":4,"text":"I think I have probably about 60 or so bars back there,"},"4087":{"dur":0,"text":"sorry I (mumbles)"},"4088":{"dur":0,"text":"Oh yeah.\n- [Michael] We have

more about why you're wary of something"},"4117":{"dur":2,"text":"that is pretending to be meat?"},"4122":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yeah, and this is speculation."},"4126":{"dur":2,"text":"There's probably plenty of focus groups that it's not"},"4128":{"dur":0,"text":"where my focus is."},"4129":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's probably data out there to support
