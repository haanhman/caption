off."},"35":{"dur":1,"text":"There's even a freaking laser,"},"37":{"dur":4,"text":"so you can make a cool robot\ninto an awesome robot."},"42":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, I've built\na lot of stuff out of garbage,"},"45":{"dur":2,"text":"and some of these things\nhave even been kind of useful."},"48":{"dur":1,"text":"But here's the thing,"},"49":{"dur":2,"text":"for me, garbage is just a chance to play,"},"52":{"dur":2,"text":"to be creative and build things\nto amuse myself."},"55":{"dur":3,"text":"This is what I love doing,\nso I just made it part of my day job."},"59":{"dur":2,"text":"I lead

questions\nand find answers."},"77":{"dur":1,"text":"And I realized a long time ago"},"79":{"dur":3,"text":"that if I challenge people\nto build the equipment they need"},"82":{"dur":2,"text":"out of the garbage I find,"},"84":{"dur":2,"text":"it's a great way to foster creativity."},"87":{"dur":1,"text":"And what happened"},"88":{"dur":2,"text":"was that artists and scientists\nfrom around the world"},"91":{"dur":2,"text":"started coming to my lab."},"93":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's not just because\nwe value unconventional ideas,"},"96":{"dur":2,"text":"it's because we test and validate them"},"99":{"dur":1,"text":"with scientific rigor."},"101":{"dur":3,"text":"So one day I was hacking something,\nI was taking it apart,"},"105":{"dur":1,"text":"and I had this sudden idea:"},"107":{"dur":3,"text":"Could I treat biology like hardware?"},"110":{"dur":2,"text":"Could I dismantle a biological system,"},"113":{"dur":1,"text":"mix and match the parts"},"114":{"dur":2,"text":"and then put it back together\nin some new and creative way?"},"117":{"dur":2,"text":"My lab started working on this,"},"120":{"dur":1,"text":"and I want to show you the

apple."},"130":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, I actually want you to notice as well"},"132":{"dur":2,"text":"that this is a lot redder\nthan most apples."},"136":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's because\nwe grew human cells into it."},"139":{"dur":4,"text":"We took a totally innocent\nMacintosh apple,"},"143":{"dur":3,"text":"removed all the apple cells and DNA"},"146":{"dur":2,"text":"and then implanted human cells."},"148":{"dur":3,"text":"And what we're left with\nafter removing all the apple cells"},"151":{"dur":1,"text":"is this cellulose scaffold."},"153":{"dur":3,"text":"This is the stuff that gives plants\ntheir shape and texture."},"156":{"dur":1,"text":"And these little holes that you can see,"},"158":{"dur":2,"text":"this is where all\nthe apple cells used to be."},"161":{"dur":1,"text":"So then we come along,"},"162":{"dur":3,"text":"we implant some mammalian cells\nthat you can see in blue."},"165":{"dur":2,"text":"What happens is,\nthese guys start multiplying"},"167":{"dur":1,"text":"and they fill up this entire scaffold."},"170":{"dur":1,"text":"As weird as this is,"},"172":{"dur":4,"text":"it's actually really reminiscent\nof how our own tissues are organized."},"176":{"dur":2,"text":"And we found in our pre-clinical work"},"179":{"dur":2,"text":"that you can implant\nthese scaffolds into the body,"},"181":{"dur":2,"text":"and the body will send in cells\nand a blood supply"},"184":{"dur":2,"text":"and actually keep these things alive."},"187":{"dur":3,"text":"This is the point\nwhen people started asking me,"},"190":{"dur":4,"text":"\"Andrew, can you make\nbody parts out of apples?\""},"195":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'm like, \"You've come\nto the right place.\""},"198":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"199":{"dur":2,"text":"I actually brought this up with my wife."},"201":{"dur":1,"text":"She's a musical instrument maker,"},"203":{"dur":2,"text":"and she does a lot\nof wood carving for a living."},"206":{"dur":1,"text":"So I asked her,"},"208":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Could you, like,\nliterally carve some ears"},"212":{"dur":1,"text":"out of an apple for us?\""},"213":{"dur":1,"text":"And she did."},"215":{"dur":2,"text":"So I took her ears to the lab."},"217":{"dur":1,"text":"We then started preparing them."},"220":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah, I know."},"222":{"dur":3,"text":"(Laughter)"},"225":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a good lab, man."},"227":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"228":{"dur":1,"text":"And then we grew cells on them."},"231":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is the result."},"233":{"dur":4,"text":"Listen, my lab is not\nin the ear-manufacturing business."},"239":{"dur":3,"text":"People have actually been working\non this for decades."},"243":{"dur":1,"text":"Here's the issue:"},"244":{"dur":4,"text":"commercial scaffolds can be\nreally expensive and problematic,"},"249":{"dur":2,"text":"because they're sourced\nfrom proprietary products,"},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"animals or cadavers."},"259":{"dur":2,"text":"We used an apple and it cost pennies."},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"What's also really cool here"},"264":{"dur":2,"text":"is it's not that hard\nto make these things."},"267":{"dur":2,"text":"The equipment you need\ncan be built from garbage,"},"270":{"dur":4,"text":"and the key processing step\nonly requires soap and water."},"274":{"dur":3,"text":"So what we did was put all\nthe instructions online as open source."},"279":{"dur":2,"text":"And then we founded\na mission-driven company,"},"281":{"dur":2,"text":"and we're developing kits\nto make it easier"},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"for anyone with a sink\nand a soldering iron"},"286":{"dur":1,"text":"to make these things at

funny."},"308":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"309":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, I was in my kitchen,\nand I was noticing"},"312":{"dur":2,"text":"that when you look down\nthe stalks of these asparagus,"},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"what you can see\nare all these tiny little vessels."},"317":{"dur":1,"text":"And when we image them in the lab,"},"319":{"dur":2,"text":"you can see how the cellulose\nforms these structures."},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"This image reminds me of two things:"},"325":{"dur":1,"text":"our blood vessels"},"327":{"dur":3,"text":"and the structure and organization\nof our nerves and spinal cord."},"331":{"dur":1,"text":"So here's the question:"},"333":{"dur":4,"text":"Can we grow axons and neurons\ndown these channels?"},"338":{"dur":1,"text":"Because if we can,"},"339":{"dur":4,"text":"then maybe we can use asparagus\nto form new connections"},"344":{"dur":2,"text":"between the ends of damaged\nand severed nerves."},"347":{"dur":1,"text":"Or maybe even a spinal cord."},"350":{"dur":1,"text":"Don't get me wrong --"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"this is exceptionally challenging"},"353":{"dur":1,"text":"and really hard work to do,"},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"and we are not the only ones\nworking on this."},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"But we are the only ones using asparagus."},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"(Laughter)"},"364":{"dur":3,"text":"Right now, we've got\nreally promising pilot data."},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"And we're working with tissue engineers"},"369":{"dur":1,"text":"and neurosurgeons"},"370":{"dur":1,"text":"to find out what's actually possible."},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"So listen, all of the work I've shown

old,"},"403":{"dur":4,"text":"broken-down, malfunctioning,\npiece-of-crap technology,"},"407":{"dur":1,"text":"I want you to think of me."},"410":{"dur":1,"text":"Because I want it."},"411":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"412":{"dur":4,"text":"Seriously, please find any way\nto get in touch with me,"},"416":{"dur":1,"text":"and let's see what we can
