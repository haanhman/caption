animals\nat the Sanctuary."},"116":{"dur":4,"text":"At Farm Sanctuary, the animals are our friends,\nnot our food."},"120":{"dur":4,"text":"We treat them like most people treat their\ncats and dogs."},"124":{"dur":1,"text":"Cows get to be who they are."},"126":{"dur":1,"text":"They get to go outside."},"127":{"dur":1,"text":"They get to exercise."},"128":{"dur":3,"text":"They get to

makes"},"159":{"dur":3,"text":"that kind of confinement even that much more\nupsetting."},"163":{"dur":5,"text":"When the animals first come to Farm Sanctuary,\noftentimes they're very frightened."},"168":{"dur":1,"text":"They've only known cruelty at human hands."},"170":{"dur":2,"text":"But as time goes, they learn to trust us."},"172":{"dur":1,"text":"They learn to enjoy life."},"174":{"dur":3,"text":"They learn to play and experience pleasure\nand joy for the first time."},"178":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a beautiful thing to see."},"180":{"dur":4,"text":"And they also show companionship and friendship."},"184":{"dur":4,"text":"That's a picture of Lydia, who we used to\ncall the Hugging Turkey because you'd go out"},"188":{"dur":4,"text":"into the barnyard and kneel down, and she\nwould walk over to you and crane her neck"},"193":{"dur":4,"text":"around your neck, like she was giving you\na hug."},"198":{"dur":4,"text":"So I've spent a lot of time at the farm

I didn't really put them together."},"229":{"dur":4,"text":"But as time went, I started recognizing that\nI didn't have to eat animals."},"233":{"dur":4,"text":"And I realized, as I grew up, I never really\nmade a conscious choice to eat animals."},"238":{"dur":3,"text":"It was something everybody around me was doing,\nso I just started doing it."},"241":{"dur":5,"text":"And I think most of us live our lives in a\nway where we just do things that other people"},"247":{"dur":1,"text":"around us are doing."},"248":{"dur":2,"text":"It's just what we do."},"250":{"dur":1,"text":"We're very social animals."},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"We learn from those around us."},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"And so my parents were eating animals, my\nbrothers and sisters."},"256":{"dur":1,"text":"Everybody I knew was."},"257":{"dur":3,"text":"So I did it without really thinking about\nit."},"260":{"dur":4,"text":"But as time went and I started recognizing\nthat I didn't have to eat animals, and that"},"265":{"dur":7,"text":"these animals had feelings much like cats\nand dogs, and that it was healthier, I went"},"273":{"dur":1,"text":"vegan in 1985."},"274":{"dur":4,"text":"I got a couple

very high in this country, partly\nbecause of the system, but also largely because"},"294":{"dur":1,"text":"of the way we eat."},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"Because we're not as healthy as we could be."},"298":{"dur":3,"text":"And sadly, our health care expenditures continue\nincreasing."},"302":{"dur":3,"text":"There's a movie out right now called Forks\nOver Knives that I would recommend if you"},"305":{"dur":1,"text":"haven't seen it."},"306":{"dur":5,"text":"The experts in that movie estimate that we\ncould save 70-80% on our health care costs"},"312":{"dur":5,"text":"in this country by shifting to a whole foods,\nplant-based diet, shifting away from processed"},"317":{"dur":2,"text":"food, shifting away from animal food."},"320":{"dur":6,"text":"The way we eat has profound impacts, not only\non other animals, but on our own health."},"326":{"dur":4,"text":"When we eat in a way that we do in this country,\nwe're seeing huge problems."},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"Heart disease and cancer are the top two killers."},"333":{"dur":5,"text":"The risks of both could be seriously lessened\nby shifting towards a plant-based diet."},"339":{"dur":3,"text":"Another impact animal agriculture has is on\nthe environment."},"342":{"dur":5,"text":"These are some quotes from a United Nations\nstudy called Livestock's Long Shadow."},"348":{"dur":5,"text":"And as you see here, it talks about how the\nlivestock industry is a major contributor"},"353":{"dur":3,"text":"to the most significant environmental problems\nwe're facing."},"356":{"dur":5,"text":"It's a major player responsible for contributing\nmore to greenhouse gas emissions than the"},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"entire transportation industry."},"364":{"dur":5,"text":"So if you take all of the cars and trains\nand boats and planes and combine the emissions,"},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"it would be less than what comes from animal\nagriculture."},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"This is according to the United Nations."},"375":{"dur":6,"text":"[pause] According to the UN, the livestock\nsector should be a major policy focus when"},"381":{"dur":3,"text":"dealing with problems of land degradation,\nclimate change and air pollution, water shortage"},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"and water pollution, loss of biodiversity."},"388":{"dur":3,"text":"The contribution is on a massive scale."},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"The contribution to the solution could be\nhuge."},"395":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, unfortunately, agribusiness is very entrenched\nin politics."},"400":{"dur":3,"text":"They've invested for years in the legislative\nprocess."},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"They have a lot of control."},"406":{"dur":5,"text":"Back in the 1970s, there was a report that\nwent out that encouraged Americans to eat"},"411":{"dur":1,"text":"less meat."},"412":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, that report was in print for about a\nday, and then it was changed and reworded"},"418":{"dur":7,"text":"to say, \"We should eat more meat that is lower\nin saturated fat\" which mixes up the message"},"425":{"dur":3,"text":"and has the ultimate result of people eating\nmore meat."},"429":{"dur":4,"text":"We've continued doing that, and our health\nhas suffered as a result."},"433":{"dur":4,"text":"Another cost of animal agriculture has to\ndo with energy use."},"438":{"dur":4,"text":"This is a slide from a New York Times article\nthat was entitled \"Rethinking the Meat Guzzler\","},"443":{"dur":4,"text":"and it compares the amount of fossil

problems have been exacerbated over\nthe years by this move away from small farms"},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"towards larger industrialized operations."},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"The number of farms in our country has been\ndecreasing."},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"The size of each farm has been increasing."},"465":{"dur":4,"text":"So we don't have the typical family farm that\nmany of us envision anymore."},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"We have these industrialized operations."},"471":{"dur":5,"text":"[pause]\nNow, when Farm Sanctuary started in 1986,"},"477":{"dur":4,"text":"I spent a lot of time going to stockyards\nand farms and slaughterhouses to document"},"481":{"dur":1,"text":"what was happening."},"482":{"dur":4,"text":"This is a picture taken of Lancaster Stockyard,\nwhich was, at the time, the largest stockyard"},"487":{"dur":1,"text":"east of Chicago."},"488":{"dur":4,"text":"Cows, pigs, sheep, goats would be transported\nhere to be sold."},"493":{"dur":6,"text":"There were seen

commodities."},"504":{"dur":5,"text":"What became apparent was the way I looked\nat these animals, and the way that these livestock"},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"people looked at the animals, was very different."},"513":{"dur":1,"text":"I would look into the animals' faces."},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"I would see their expressions."},"516":{"dur":3,"text":"I would recognize that they were afraid."},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"The handlers were not looking into the animals'\nfaces."},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"They're literally looking at cuts of meat."},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"They're looking at body conformation."},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"They're looking at meat on the hoof."},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"And they sell them by the pound."},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's a very different perspective."},"533":{"dur":4,"text":"And when these animals are seen just as commodities,\nthey're oftentimes whipped, they're beaten,"},"538":{"dur":1,"text":"they're shocked."},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"Living animals are thrown away."},"542":{"dur":2,"text":"Animals die routinely in the process."},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"That's a picture of the dead pile behind the\nstockyard."},"547":{"dur":4,"text":"The day I took this picture, there were dead\npigs, dead cows, dead sheep."},"552":{"dur":3,"text":"As I approached, the maggots were so thick\nyou could hear them buzzing."},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"It was a hot August day."},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"And the stink was horrible, as you can imagine."},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"The sheep at the far right was actually alive."},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"She lifted her head."},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"And as you can imagine, we were stunned to\nfind a living animal thrown in this dead pile."},"569":{"dur":4,"text":"I took her off the dead pile, brought her\nto a nearby veterinary, thinking she would"},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"have to be euthanized."},"576":{"dur":1,"text":"But she stood up."},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"And she lived with us for more than ten years."},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's Hilda, our first rescued animal."},"582":{"dur":1,"text":"Since her, we've rescued thousands."},"584":{"dur":1,"text":"Each of these animals becomes an ambassador."},"586":{"dur":4,"text":"When people learn where Hilda came from and\nwhere these animals-- the way these animals"},"590":{"dur":4,"text":"suffer in this industry, it can be a very\ntransformative experience, especially when"},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"you get to know these animals at Farm Sanctuary\nlike many people know their cats and dogs,"},"599":{"dur":1,"text":"and hearing about their stories."},"600":{"dur":5,"text":"So it began a campaign at Lancaster Stockyards\nafter there was no movement on prosecuting"},"606":{"dur":3,"text":"the stockyard for leaving this downed animal\non the dead pile."},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"And our position was that if an animal's too\nsick to walk, that animal should be humanely"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"euthanized or should be given proper veterinary\ncare."},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"They should not just be left to suffer on\nthe dead pile."},"619":{"dur":6,"text":"They shouldn't be left to suffer and die in\nthe alleyways, which was also commonly happening."},"625":{"dur":3,"text":"But at the time, Lancaster Stockyards was\nseen

who lived in a school bus"},"637":{"dur":5,"text":"on the tofu farm that funded the organization\nby selling vegetarian hot dogs at Grateful"},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"Dead concerts."},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"So we had a lot of convincing to do in the\ncommunity."},"647":{"dur":4,"text":"But as time went, and as people started seeing\nthese images of animals left for

Stockyard."},"674":{"dur":6,"text":"It was a vegan event to celebrate Hilda's\n25th-- the 25th anniversary of Hilda's rescue."},"680":{"dur":1,"text":"The Stockyard owner said

would host this event."},"689":{"dur":4,"text":"And he said that it was a very positive experience,\nthat he learned a lot about it, that this"},"693":{"dur":6,"text":"is the wave of the future, and from now on,\nhe's going to have a vegan item on his menu."},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"And while the stockyard is now gone, Farm\nSanctuary has grown."},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"That's our farm in Watkins

that\nthey're really not that different than the"},"729":{"dur":3,"text":"cats and dogs who many of us live with."},"732":{"dur":6,"text":"But far away from Farm Sanctuary, on farms\nall over this
