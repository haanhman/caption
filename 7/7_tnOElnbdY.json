That would be your sort of trade"},"125":{"dur":1,"text":"of the week then as we look at cotton, get\nshort?"},"126":{"dur":3,"text":"Kub: Yes, I think so.

You bet. Now, we've got a question"},"148":{"dur":4,"text":"from John in Columbia, Missouri and we're\ngoing to have you gaze into your crystal ball"},"152":{"dur":6,"text":"here. Look out to 2014 and John is curious,\ncan any ag product rally this year? And what"},"159":{"dur":5,"text":"will it take? We're seeing one going on with\nfat cattle trade. What else out there looks"},"164":{"dur":4,"text":"Kub: Well, to answer his first question, can\nany ag commodity -- yes, of course. Of course"},"168":{"dur":5,"text":"they can. Anything can happen. And, like I\nsaid earlier in the show, that was the sort"},"174":{"dur":3,"text":"of thing that we were looking at in soybeans\neven when it was a little bit dry in Brazil"},"177":{"dur":4,"text":"and quite a bit dry in Argentina.

But\nthat is not happening anymore in South America."},"187":{"dur":4,"text":"I think that shipped has sailed. Their pods\nare filling fine. They have plentiful moisture"},"191":{"dur":4,"text":"in the forecast, even the long range forecast\nthat will get them started into harvest, if"},"195":{"dur":5,"text":"anything they may be a little uncomfortably\nwet during harvest. So for our major row crop"},"200":{"dur":6,"text":"ag commodities I don't see anything in the\nnear next few months that is going to trigger"},"206":{"dur":3,"text":"a rally. But we've still got the North American\ncrop to get through. We have no idea what"},"210":{"dur":3,"text":"the spring and summer weather is going to\nbe like. So within the year, to answer his"},"214":{"dur":4,"text":"question, of course they can. But that is\nwhat it would take in my opinion to be some"},"218":{"dur":6,"text":"sort of weather effect or to go back to the\nlivestock or other commodities some sort of"},"225":{"dur":4,"text":"really juiced up demand. Like I mentioned,\ncrude oil was not able to go above $100 per"},"230":{"dur":4,"text":"barrel just because the economy is not growing\nthat fast, it's not that optimistic.

That's what\nit would take to drive them to even higher"},"252":{"dur":5,"text":"Pearson: Alright. So there's a lot of potential\nout there in a new year as there often is."},"257":{"dur":6,"text":"And you mentioned the row crops, waiting on\na weather event, March of 2012, April of 2012"},"263":{"dur":3,"text":"we were all counting on huge planted acreage,\nhuge corn crop --"},"267":{"dur":2,"text":"Kub: 14 billion bushel crop, which we may\nfinally get."},"269":{"dur":3,"text":"Pearson: Right, and we'll find out on the\n10th. Now, Phil in Canada has a question."},"273":{"dur":3,"text":"We're going to bring it back to wheat. We\ntalked about that a little bit on the show."},"276":{"dur":5,"text":"Phil is curious, is there hope for wheat looking\nout longer term?

Now, we've got a couple\nof questions, guys curious about corn. Bob"},"353":{"dur":3,"text":"in Nebraska is asking -- and we touched on\nthis on the show but maybe you can go into"},"357":{"dur":5,"text":"a little bit more detail -- Bob says, for\nthose of us still holding onto 2013 corn what"},"362":{"dur":4,"text":"do you feel about the chances we will see\nan increase in the corn cash price in the"},"366":{"dur":6,"text":"month of January when compared to cash harvest\nprices we could have received.

This is just typically the time of year\nwhen farmers may be selling or the commercial"},"392":{"dur":5,"text":"mills and consumers are still working through\nthe harvest stockpiles. So this is not the"},"397":{"dur":5,"text":"time of year where you would ever typically\nexpect to see a rally in cash corn prices."},"403":{"dur":4,"text":"And as far as a worst case scenario I think\nthat yes, I think that the size of the harvest"},"408":{"dur":5,"text":"and the size of demand is pretty well priced\nin at this point. But a worst case scenario"},"413":{"dur":4,"text":"January crop report could be quite wild indeed\nand we could easily see that average cash"},"418":{"dur":5,"text":"corn price in the country fall well below\n$4.00 or 20 cents below $4.00 let's say. That"},"423":{"dur":6,"text":"could happen on a really volatile crop report,\nworst case scenario. But I think that the"},"430":{"dur":6,"text":"market is pretty well priced in the anticipation\nof a 14 billion bushel number from the USDA"},"436":{"dur":3,"text":"and hopefully nobody will be too surprised\nby that when this comes out."},"439":{"dur":3,"text":"Pearson: There's bearish sentiments already\nin the price but --"},"443":{"dur":1,"text":"Kub: Maybe not worst case scenario."},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"Pearson: Certainly. That would be a great\nbuying opportunity if we already were pricing"},"448":{"dur":0,"text":"in worst case scenario."},"449":{"dur":3,"text":"Pearson: You bet. Alright. Well, Elaine, we\nreally thank you for being with us.
