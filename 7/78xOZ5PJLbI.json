me"},"76":{"dur":1,"text":"how bad Dragon had been\nand how they couldn't"},"77":{"dur":1,"text":"help their students use it."},"79":{"dur":1,"text":"And it wasn't a great start to Danet,"},"81":{"dur":2,"text":"I was feeling a bit sad\nand then Mel and Shannon"},"84":{"dur":1,"text":"came up and made me\nfeel a whole lot better"},"86":{"dur":1,"text":"because they were so

able to share"},"182":{"dur":2,"text":"some tips and tricks\nand how it can be used."},"185":{"dur":2,"text":"We've seen it used quite well."},"187":{"dur":2,"text":"So what we're going to cover,\nShannon's going to talk"},"190":{"dur":3,"text":"through Dare's approach\nto using this technology,"},"193":{"dur":2,"text":"some of the different students that we've."},"195":{"dur":1,"text":"or different student sub-groups"},"196":{"dur":1,"text":"that we've used the program with,"},"198":{"dur":2,"text":"and also the general age that we tend"},"201":{"dur":4,"text":"to introduce assistive\ntechnology options and Dragon."},"205":{"dur":1,"text":"We'll talk you through\njust a couple of things"},"207":{"dur":1,"text":"about setting up with hardware"},"209":{"dur":3,"text":"and also how to set up\nthe Dragon user profile."},"212":{"dur":1,"text":"The process is slightly different"},"214":{"dur":2,"text":"from what you do with an adult user."},"216":{"dur":1,"text":"- Versus the student, yeah."},"218":{"dur":3,"text":"- Yeah, and then we'll talk you through"},"221":{"dur":3,"text":"some outcomes from our\nclinical experience,"},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"and also some common concerns\nand how to address those"},"227":{"dur":2,"text":"so that it can be used in the classroom."},"230":{"dur":2,"text":"And we'll leave some time for\nquestions at the end as well."},"232":{"dur":2,"text":"- Sounds like a full program,\nyou'd better get cracking."},"235":{"dur":1,"text":"(Mel and Shannon laugh)"},"236":{"dur":1,"text":"- Very quickly, no."},"239":{"dur":3,"text":"Alright, so the kinds of, I guess how we"},"242":{"dur":4,"text":"got started was Dare opened as a quite"},"246":{"dur":2,"text":"a generalist pediatric practice,"},"248":{"dur":4,"text":"but we slowly developed a\nspecial interest in literacy"},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"and trying to help students\naccess the curriculum"},"256":{"dur":3,"text":"that were really not\nreading and writing well."},"259":{"dur":5,"text":"So we worked in traditional\nliteracy therapy,"},"265":{"dur":3,"text":"we still do, but there was a huge need,"},"268":{"dur":1,"text":"or we could see a huge need,"},"269":{"dur":4,"text":"for students who had\namazing language skills,"},"274":{"dur":4,"text":"or good cognitive ability\nand yet couldn't get"},"278":{"dur":1,"text":"their thoughts down onto paper,"},"280":{"dur":3,"text":"and were in essence running out of time"},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"to get those skills up to speed"},"286":{"dur":1,"text":"and to catch up with their peers."},"288":{"dur":4,"text":"So we, I think one of\nour very first clients"},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"was having significant\nmental health issues"},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"in terms of anxiety, school refusal,"},"299":{"dur":2,"text":"and was actually having physical aversions"},"302":{"dur":1,"text":"to going to school."},"303":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was all around\nfrustration and anxiety"},"306":{"dur":2,"text":"over not being able to\nread and write basically."},"309":{"dur":3,"text":"So I knew there had to\nbe a solution out there"},"312":{"dur":2,"text":"and that really got us\nGoogling and searching"},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"and trying to find whether the technology"},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"that adults use quite comfortably"},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"could be used for these students"},"323":{"dur":3,"text":"to relieve some of the pressure of school."},"329":{"dur":3,"text":"Initially we really,\nwe weren't just looking"},"332":{"dur":1,"text":"at speech to text,"},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"although that was\nobviously a big part of it,"},"336":{"dur":4,"text":"we were also looking at text to speech,"},"340":{"dur":3,"text":"visual mind mapping, organization tools,"},"344":{"dur":3,"text":"to give them a toolkit\nwith which to get round"},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"whatever difficulties they were having."},"351":{"dur":1,"text":"Unfortunately these\nthings weren't being done,"},"353":{"dur":1,"text":"certainly when I started"},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"they weren't being done in Australia,"},"357":{"dur":1,"text":"and certainly not very well."},"359":{"dur":4,"text":"But we're lucky enough\nthat the US and the UK"},"363":{"dur":1,"text":"have some good models--\n- [Mel] Leading the way."},"365":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Shannon] Yeah, they're leading the way,"},"366":{"dur":1,"text":"they have some good models,"},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"and I guess the population is bigger"},"369":{"dur":1,"text":"so they had more case studies"},"371":{"dur":3,"text":"and more of a chance to\ntry these things out."},"374":{"dur":1,"text":"So we kind of tried to piggy back off"},"376":{"dur":3,"text":"what was going on there\nand that's where we went."},"380":{"dur":4,"text":"So initially our users, the\nstudents that we were seeing,"},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"our student users, were\nthe dyslexic students."},"388":{"dur":3,"text":"The ones who had great\noral language skills,"},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"you could have really\ninformed conversations with,"},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"but who could just not read and write,"},"398":{"dur":4,"text":"at single word level or\nat any extended level."},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"Interestingly as we got more comfortable"},"405":{"dur":3,"text":"with assistive technology,\nwe started to see students"},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"that had problems with fine motor skills,"},"410":{"dur":3,"text":"so handwriting, that\nmore dysgraphic student."},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"Obviously these things\ncan overlap as well,"},"415":{"dur":3,"text":"you can have one student\nwith more than one disorder."},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"As the software improved over the years,"},"423":{"dur":4,"text":"the versions improved, we\nstarted to see that we could"},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"use the software quite\ncomfortably with students"},"430":{"dur":3,"text":"who had such severe\nphonological difficulties,"},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"which means sound processing problems,"},"436":{"dur":2,"text":"that even their speech was affected."},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"So that was really the underlying issue"},"441":{"dur":4,"text":"that was causing so much of\ntheir literacy difficulties."},"445":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's become better and better"},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"as the versions have gone\non, I think we'd say."},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"- Were you having success early on"},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"or have you had to wait for a while"},"454":{"dur":1,"text":"before it got good enough to use?"},"456":{"dur":3,"text":"- It was difficult, so\nversion 11 and 11.5,"},"459":{"dur":4,"text":"were time consuming and quite tedious."},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"But version 12 there was\na significant improvement"},"467":{"dur":4,"text":"and version 13 now blows 12\nout of the water by miles."},"471":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Derek] Interesting.\n- [Shannon] We tend to use"},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"the academic version because our students"},"476":{"dur":3,"text":"can get discounts as being a student user,"},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"as long as they can prove\nthat they're a student."},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"And that makes a huge difference"},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"on the financial burden\nto the families using"},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"these things.\n- The software's the same,"},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"so it's really just, I think\nwe've covered this before,"},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"it's just a discount for students."},"492":{"dur":3,"text":"- Yeah, exactly, so we\nhaven't yet tried 14 and--"},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"- We'll get you to that."},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"- Some of the schools though have bought"},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"the professional version because"},"500":{"dur":1,"text":"it has a site license for their students."},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's also been really good,"},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"the features involved with that."},"505":{"dur":1,"text":"There was actually a question that came"},"507":{"dur":3,"text":"through prior to the webinar tonight"},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"that was asking about ESL students."},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"For those who don't know what\nESL is it's actually students"},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"who have English as a second language,"},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"that's what it stands for."},"521":{"dur":1,"text":"Our particular clinical experience"},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"hasn't been great in that area"},"526":{"dur":4,"text":"but it's more to do with"},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"our geographical location,"},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"the demographics in the\narea that we work in."},"537":{"dur":4,"text":"So we do know the research\naround that but clinically"},"541":{"dur":3,"text":"we haven't had as much\nexperience in that area."},"544":{"dur":1,"text":"But we'll touch--\n- [Mel] We have found"},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"with some of our students"},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"who have oral language problems as well,"},"549":{"dur":1,"text":"so difficulty formulating their ideas"},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"just when they're speaking as well,"},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"that Dragon has improved that as well as"},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"helping with their written language."},"558":{"dur":4,"text":"And I would say that it's a\nsimilar case with ESL students."},"562":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Shannon] Yes, yes.\n- [Derek] So having to learn"},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"to dictate means you pronounce"},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"more clearly, is that"},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"kind of what you mean or?\n- It's less the pronunciation"},"568":{"dur":1,"text":"and more the formulation."},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"So being able to express\nyour thoughts more clearly"},"572":{"dur":4,"text":"without having those\nuhm and ah, er, that's--"},"577":{"dur":1,"text":"- This is an argument\nwe've, this is off topic,"},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"but we've been making the same\nargument for lawyers actually"},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"because lawyers don't do\ndictation so much anymore,"},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"they've lost a lot of\nthat ability as lawyers."},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"So it doesn't just\napply to younger people."},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"- No, and it is a skill, and we"},"590":{"dur":0,"text":"touch on--\n- Thinking on your feet."},"591":{"dur":1,"text":"we touch on that a little bit later."},"593":{"dur":1,"text":"So we will speak about it more."},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"And I guess the thing that you'll find"},"596":{"dur":4,"text":"from our presentation is that"},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"we don't promote Dragon"},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"or any assistive technology as a cure all."},"605":{"dur":3,"text":"It is not something that is\ngoing to fix what is going on."},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"It does have some remediation benefit"},"611":{"dur":3,"text":"I think you'll find but it isn't something"},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"that is going to fix\nwhatever underlying issue"},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"is going on for that student."},"620":{"dur":3,"text":"To do that you need to do\nintensive, systematic therapy,"},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"especially for literacy,\nto have any effect."},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"What this does is relieve some pressure"},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"and allow those kids who have academic"},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"and cognitive potential\nto reach that potential."},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a bypass, it's a\nget-around, in a lot of ways."},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"- We've really found that it\ncan be preventative as well."},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"So for students with\nliteracy difficulties,"},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"as they continue to struggle\naccessing the curriculum,"},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"it can lead to then problems with learning"},"647":{"dur":3,"text":"that high level vocabulary\nyou access in written texts"},"650":{"dur":3,"text":"at school as opposed to just\nconversational language."},"653":{"dur":1,"text":"So giving them Dragon and other"},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"assistive technology programs\nmeans that they can then go on"},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"to develop those other\nskills and not be held back."},"661":{"dur":1,"text":"- And just for people who may not be aware"},"663":{"dur":1,"text":"of some of those other technologies"},"665":{"dur":3,"text":"what sort of other packages\ngo with Dragon in this case?"},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"- So we have our favorites,"},"671":{"dur":1,"text":"they're not always the ones\nthat we're going to use"},"673":{"dur":0,"text":"for everyone--\n- [Derek] Yeah, that's okay."},"674":{"dur":4,"text":"- [Shannon] But our golden\nthree would be Dragon,"},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"Read and Write Gold, and we\nlove a program called Ghotit,"},"681":{"dur":1,"text":"which is a text prediction program."},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"So we find it's a little,\nit has features in it,"},"685":{"dur":2,"text":"that the prediction feature\nin Read and Write Gold"},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"doesn't have, it doesn't\nquite hit the spot."},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"But we still can't get\nrid of Read and Write Gold"},"691":{"dur":1,"text":"because of its features as well."},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"So we find they neatly sit together."},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"And I guess the student learns"},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"to pull out what tool they need."},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"- And I know you can't generalize\nfrom student to student"},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"but is it often that a student will have"},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"more than one piece of\nsoftware in those cases?"},"707":{"dur":4,"text":"- Absolutely, I would say\nexcept for the few students"},"711":{"dur":4,"text":"we've had who have just\nhad fine motor problems."},"716":{"dur":1,"text":"So they've come to me because they"},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"need to find someone\nwho works with Dragon."},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"Some occupational therapists do"},"722":{"dur":1,"text":"but obviously through the grapevine"},"723":{"dur":1,"text":"they've heard my name, they do not have"},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"any literacy or language\nproblems but they have"},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"fine motor or gross motor problems"},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"that make typing difficult."},"732":{"dur":3,"text":"And one student once we set up her Dragon"},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"she wrote a novel off her own bat,"},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"but she didn't need to\nsee me for any other"},"741":{"dur":3,"text":"literacy intervention or any\nother language intervention."},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"So she didn't need any other software,"},"747":{"dur":1,"text":"she was just a Dragon user."},"748":{"dur":1,"text":"- Just to be clear then, the advantage,"},"750":{"dur":1,"text":"the way I always thought of Dragon"},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"is that if a student has difficulty"},"755":{"dur":1,"text":"getting the connection between"},"756":{"dur":1,"text":"what they're thinking of saying"},"758":{"dur":1,"text":"and then getting it out onto paper"},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"Dragon can help in the\nsituations where you want"},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"to unblock that and get the language out."},"764":{"dur":3,"text":"- Yep, we typically think\nabout Dragon as writing,"},"767":{"dur":3,"text":"Ghotit as writing but through typing,"},"770":{"dur":2,"text":"and Read and Write Gold\nis primarily reading"},"773":{"dur":1,"text":"but also vocabulary and things like that."},"775":{"dur":1,"text":"So they tackle different areas,"},"776":{"dur":1,"text":"different assistive technology\ntackle different issues."},"778":{"dur":2,"text":"- Uhu-huh, understood."},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"- So before we jumped into\nsetting up a Dragon profile"},"783":{"dur":1,"text":"for students we just wanted to touch"},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"on a couple of hardware things."},"787":{"dur":1,"text":"We've had a few questions come through"},"789":{"dur":4,"text":"talking about unsuccessful\nexperiences using the software"},"794":{"dur":1,"text":"and I suppose, from our experience,"},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"we're really happy with Dragon 13,"},"798":{"dur":2,"text":"but we've noticed frustration occur"},"800":{"dur":2,"text":"when the hardware your using doesn't mean"},"803":{"dur":2,"text":"the software can perform optimally."},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"So don't underestimate the\nquality of the computer"},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"you're using, the quality\nof the headset you're using,"},"811":{"dur":2,"text":"in allowing Dragon to do its job well."},"813":{"dur":1,"text":"- Just before you go on\ncould you just say the,"},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"Megalegs just didn't catch the names,"},"818":{"dur":1,"text":"oh you got it Megalegs?"},"819":{"dur":1,"text":"Could you just say the three\nnames of that software again?"},"821":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, and I should spell one of them."},"823":{"dur":1,"text":"So there's Read and Write Gold"},"824":{"dur":4,"text":"which is actually made by\nTexthelp, it's a UK based company,"},"829":{"dur":2,"text":"but they do have an Australian version."},"831":{"dur":3,"text":"Obviously Dragon, and Ghotit."},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"It's spelled interestingly\nbecause it was actually designed"},"837":{"dur":5,"text":"by a dyslexic software\nengineer, so it's G-H-O-T-I-T."},"844":{"dur":1,"text":"So if you're trying to search for that"},"845":{"dur":1,"text":"you definitely have to spell it correctly."},"847":{"dur":0,"text":"- One word?"},"848":{"dur":1,"text":"- All one word, yes.\n- [Mel] Yes."},"849":{"dur":0,"text":"- [Derek] Got it.\n(Mel and Shannon laugh)"},"850":{"dur":1,"text":"- You got it? Good."},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"- So yeah, just back on hardware quickly,"},"855":{"dur":4,"text":"Dragon's produced some really\nhelpful laptop specifications"},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"and we've used those as a good guideline"},"861":{"dur":2,"text":"when we're recommending, or providing,"},"863":{"dur":3,"text":"some guidance to parents who\nare shopping for a laptop."},"867":{"dur":3,"text":"And we also sometimes provide\nthat to school IT departments"},"870":{"dur":2,"text":"if they're trying to\nfigure out if they can run"},"872":{"dur":2,"text":"the Dragon software on their computer."},"875":{"dur":3,"text":"So hope on the Nuance website\nto get those specifications"},"878":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's a good guideline"},"880":{"dur":2,"text":"for the minimum\nspecifications you'll need."},"882":{"dur":2,"text":"Often our students are running Texthelp,"},"884":{"dur":2,"text":"Read and Write Gold, Dragon, Ghotit,"},"887":{"dur":3,"text":"Word, internet, so that's the\nminimum baseline you need."},"891":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you want it to\nping and be really fast"},"893":{"dur":2,"text":"you want a good quality computer."},"895":{"dur":1,"text":"That's what we found in our experience."},"897":{"dur":2,"text":"- And sometimes you have to sacrifice"},"899":{"dur":4,"text":"weight or portability sometimes\nto get that CPU or RAM."},"904":{"dur":2,"text":"And we're not IT experts but\nthat's just what we've seen."},"907":{"dur":2,"text":"- We were talking about\nsome of the challenges"},"909":{"dur":1,"text":"in the school systems,"},"910":{"dur":2,"text":"having computers that really aren't up"},"912":{"dur":1,"text":"to running some of the modern software"},"914":{"dur":1,"text":"but I think I'd be right in saying"},"916":{"dur":2,"text":"that most modern devices you can get,"},"918":{"dur":1,"text":"as long as you've got enough memory,"},"919":{"dur":1,"text":"are probably fast enough right?"},"920":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah.\n- [Mel] Yeah, it's really"},"921":{"dur":2,"text":"how many gigahertz that CPU can get up to"},"924":{"dur":2,"text":"that really we find quite crucial."},"927":{"dur":1,"text":"- And the other thing that's really good"},"929":{"dur":1,"text":"to invest in is a headset."},"931":{"dur":1,"text":"So we've brought our one along,"},"933":{"dur":1,"text":"it's from the list that\nDragon has also put"},"935":{"dur":2,"text":"out about recommendations for headsets."},"938":{"dur":2,"text":"But there's a few features that we"},"940":{"dur":1,"text":"really like this headset for."},"942":{"dur":2,"text":"First of all it's monaural\nso the single earpiece"},"945":{"dur":2,"text":"means that students can use it in class"},"947":{"dur":2,"text":"because they just have one\nheadset they can listen,"},"950":{"dur":1,"text":"one earpiece they can listen through"},"951":{"dur":2,"text":"and the other ear is\nfree for them to listen"},"953":{"dur":3,"text":"to the class teacher without\ntaking the headset on and off."},"957":{"dur":3,"text":"This little button here lets\nyou control the microphone"},"960":{"dur":3,"text":"from this button rather\nthan from the toolbar"},"964":{"dur":1,"text":"turning on and off that way."},"966":{"dur":1,"text":"And we just found that simpler and easier"},"967":{"dur":2,"text":"for students that we're working with."},"969":{"dur":2,"text":"The other thing is that the microphone"},"972":{"dur":2,"text":"that we've got here is noise cancelling"},"974":{"dur":2,"text":"so in a classroom\nenvironment if you've got"},"977":{"dur":1,"text":"Bob sitting next to you chatting away"},"979":{"dur":1,"text":"it won't pick up what he's saying"},"980":{"dur":3,"text":"and you can also speak\nat quite a quiet volume"},"984":{"dur":1,"text":"and it will still pick\nup what you're saying."},"986":{"dur":2,"text":"So we've just found that a good headset"},"988":{"dur":2,"text":"makes a big difference,\nparticularly with integrating"},"990":{"dur":2,"text":"the software use into the classroom."},"992":{"dur":2,"text":"- And particularly with this client group,"},"995":{"dur":2,"text":"in that they're speech is not always clear"},"997":{"dur":3,"text":"and that they do often lose\ntheir train of thought,"},"1001":{"dur":3,"text":"that mute button is really\nhelpful for this client group."},"1004":{"dur":3,"text":"So I know that the software\ncomes with a headset,"},"1007":{"dur":3,"text":"we tend to advise our clients\nfor the reasons we outlined"},"1011":{"dur":2,"text":"to invest in a different headset."},"1013":{"dur":1,"text":"- And we test a lot of headsets,"},"1015":{"dur":2,"text":"it's on our support page on the website,"},"1018":{"dur":2,"text":"but we don't test\neverything so just because"},"1020":{"dur":2,"text":"it's not on the website\ndoesn't mean it doesn't work."},"1023":{"dur":1,"text":"But noise cancelling is important"},"1024":{"dur":3,"text":"and being validated for speech\nrecognition is important."},"1028":{"dur":1,"text":"The other thing a headset, a boom does,"},"1029":{"dur":2,"text":"is keeps the microphone a\nset distance from the mouth."},"1032":{"dur":2,"text":"So it stops the mic moving around"},"1034":{"dur":2,"text":"and the audio volume going\nup and down all the time"},"1037":{"dur":2,"text":"which particularly for this group of users"},"1039":{"dur":2,"text":"is probably fairly important."},"1042":{"dur":3,"text":"- So what we're going to\ndo is quite artificial"},"1046":{"dur":2,"text":"but we're about to show you how"},"1048":{"dur":2,"text":"we would go through the\nprocess of setting up"},"1051":{"dur":2,"text":"a profile for a student user."},"1054":{"dur":2,"text":"- I'll just swing it around\nfor you to make it easier."},"1056":{"dur":3,"text":"is you can work out which\near you'd like to have it on."},"1060":{"dur":1,"text":"So..."},"1062":{"dur":1,"text":"- I'm the student?"},"1063":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yes, she is the student today."},"1065":{"dur":2,"text":"So for people who aren't\nfamiliar with Dragon"},"1067":{"dur":1,"text":"and the set up process we're not going"},"1069":{"dur":2,"text":"to go into that in too much detail"},"1071":{"dur":3,"text":"but it does come up with a,\nnow just a short paragraph"},"1074":{"dur":2,"text":"that you need to read to get"},"1077":{"dur":2,"text":"the basic setup of that profile happening."},"1079":{"dur":3,"text":"It used to be about a 10\nminute, they would say, profile,"},"1083":{"dur":2,"text":"but we were speaking\nearlier and I was explaining"},"1086":{"dur":2,"text":"that for one of my really severe students,"},"1088":{"dur":3,"text":"with version 11, before we\ngot any of the upgrades,"},"1091":{"dur":3,"text":"it took me one hour to get\nhim to set his profile up"},"1095":{"dur":1,"text":"in the way that I'm about to show you"},"1097":{"dur":2,"text":"so that it was clear and accurate enough"},"1099":{"dur":1,"text":"to begin training from the beginning."},"1101":{"dur":2,"text":"- But with the latest\nversion we can set it up"},"1104":{"dur":2,"text":"in maybe three minutes or something"},"1106":{"dur":1,"text":"and spend the rest of the session"},"1108":{"dur":2,"text":"working on the next thing\nwe're going to talk about"},"1110":{"dur":2,"text":"which is ongoing training to increase"},"1112":{"dur":2,"text":"the accuracy of the speech recognition."},"1115":{"dur":3,"text":"- Yeah, so I guess the most\nimportant thing to remember"},"1119":{"dur":3,"text":"is that the students\nare using the software"},"1122":{"dur":1,"text":"because their reading and writing skills"},"1123":{"dur":2,"text":"are not always great, they're not optimal."},"1126":{"dur":3,"text":"So even if they can read we tend to find"},"1129":{"dur":2,"text":"that their reading can be filled"},"1131":{"dur":2,"text":"with hesitations, and slightly dis-fluent."},"1134":{"dur":1,"text":"So we tend to actually angle the computer"},"1136":{"dur":4,"text":"away from the student and stop\nthem from reading basically."},"1140":{"dur":2,"text":"And we set up a parroting kind of system"},"1143":{"dur":4,"text":"where I will read, Mel will copy."},"1148":{"dur":2,"text":"Depending on the student's difficulties,"},"1151":{"dur":2,"text":"so if they're not just dyslexic,"},"1153":{"dur":2,"text":"or if they have short\nterm memory problems,"},"1156":{"dur":2,"text":"verbal memory problems, and can't remember"},"1158":{"dur":1,"text":"large chunks of information,"},"1160":{"dur":4,"text":"or if larger chunks of\ninformation become less clear,"},"1165":{"dur":2,"text":"which then affects the speech recognition,"},"1167":{"dur":2,"text":"it's the adult reader's job,"},"1169":{"dur":2,"text":"the person setting up the\nprofile to manage that."},"1172":{"dur":1,"text":"So I won't give her as much information"},"1174":{"dur":3,"text":"if she can't cope with it"},"1177":{"dur":2,"text":"or if it affects the speech\nquality of her voice."},"1179":{"dur":1,"text":"So we're gonna have a\nlittle bit of a play now,"},"1181":{"dur":2,"text":"just bear with me while I get it set up."},"1183":{"dur":3,"text":"So, the mute button is key for this stage."},"1188":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm just going to start."},"1191":{"dur":3,"text":"\"I am reading this text out loud.\""},"1194":{"dur":2,"text":"- \"I am reading this text out loud.\""},"1198":{"dur":2,"text":"- \"Clearly and naturally.\""},"1200":{"dur":2,"text":"- \"Clearly and naturally.\""},"1202":{"dur":2,"text":"- So even in the first little bit"},"1204":{"dur":1,"text":"you actually get a really good feel"},"1205":{"dur":2,"text":"for whether Mel's got,\neven if I haven't done"},"1208":{"dur":2,"text":"an assessment on a student,\nwhether she's got the capability"},"1210":{"dur":1,"text":"and I can stretch her a bit further"},"1211":{"dur":1,"text":"and give here a little bit more."},"1213":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm going to do that to her now."},"1217":{"dur":1,"text":"\"I will continue to use this tone"},"1219":{"dur":2,"text":"\"when I dictate with the product.\""},"1221":{"dur":2,"text":"- \"I will continue to use this tone"},"1223":{"dur":2,"text":"\"when I dictate with the product.\""},"1226":{"dur":3,"text":"- So I guess here the key\nis if they make a mistake"},"1230":{"dur":4,"text":"or they say a word slightly\nunclear or jumbled,"},"1234":{"dur":1,"text":"which is really common\nwith this client group,"},"1236":{"dur":2,"text":"especially dyslexics,"},"1238":{"dur":4,"text":"and they say something\nlike \"charasteristically\","},"1243":{"dur":1,"text":"which was a really good\none in the version 11,"},"1244":{"dur":2,"text":"none of our kids could\nsay \"characteristically\","},"1247":{"dur":1,"text":"we had to skip over that word quite a bit."},"1249":{"dur":1,"text":"You just keep going, don't stop them,"},"1250":{"dur":1,"text":"don't make them feel bad,"},"1252":{"dur":2,"text":"it's not them we're trying to change,"},"1254":{"dur":1,"text":"it's the software we will adapt later."},"1256":{"dur":1,"text":"And we'll get to that."},"1257":{"dur":3,"text":"Alright, sometimes\nbeforehand you will need"},"1261":{"dur":2,"text":"to get the student to practice\na little bit of copying"},"1264":{"dur":1,"text":"with you to get them comfortable"},"1265":{"dur":1,"text":"with the cues that you're using"},"1267":{"dur":2,"text":"when you're turning the mic on and off."},"1269":{"dur":1,"text":"And that can also give you a bit of a feel"},"1271":{"dur":3,"text":"as to whether you really\nneed to shorten it down."},"1274":{"dur":1,"text":"For some students we go even further"},"1276":{"dur":1,"text":"than I showed you at first."},"1277":{"dur":1,"text":"Then it will be something like,"},"1279":{"dur":3,"text":"\"I am\", then you turn it off."},"1282":{"dur":3,"text":"Reading this it's really\nshort bits of information"},"1286":{"dur":2,"text":"and that obviously drags\nout how long it takes."},"1288":{"dur":1,"text":"- Before you take that off can I give you"},"1290":{"dur":1,"text":"some feedback on placement"},"1291":{"dur":1,"text":"of microphones too?\n- [Shannon] Yes you can."},"1293":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Derek] Because it's right\nin front of your mouth so--"},"1294":{"dur":1,"text":"- So it should be off to the side."},"1296":{"dur":1,"text":"- Not modelling properly."},"1298":{"dur":1,"text":"- Not modelling properly.\n(Shannon and Mel laugh)"},"1299":{"dur":2,"text":"- So yeah we set all of that\nstuff up as we go usually."},"1302":{"dur":3,"text":"- Excellent, this is probably,\nyou'll probably cover"},"1305":{"dur":3,"text":"this shortly but a question from SJB."},"1309":{"dur":3,"text":"SJB is asking about students,"},"1312":{"dur":3,"text":"strategies for handling a student"},"1315":{"dur":2,"text":"when the voice changes\nbecause of speech problems"},"1318":{"dur":3,"text":"and the student has to clear\ntheir throat repeatedly"},"1321":{"dur":1,"text":"and gets fatigued with the voice."},"1323":{"dur":2,"text":"Is there anything you can do about that?"},"1325":{"dur":2,"text":"- Look it depends why those things"},"1328":{"dur":2,"text":"are going on I would say."},"1330":{"dur":3,"text":"I would say you would build into,"},"1333":{"dur":1,"text":"this is more in the training section"},"1335":{"dur":1,"text":"which we're about to cover,"},"1336":{"dur":1,"text":"but you would build in teaching them"},"1338":{"dur":3,"text":"to turn off before they\nstart to clear their throat."},"1342":{"dur":1,"text":"They'll know their going\nto clear their throat"},"1343":{"dur":2,"text":"before they actually do it,"},"1345":{"dur":1,"text":"so you would have them turn it off."},"1347":{"dur":1,"text":"You would also teach them to dictate"},"1349":{"dur":3,"text":"in a chunking or phrasing style\nso that there is less output"},"1352":{"dur":2,"text":"so therefore the fatigue\ndoesn't get too high"},"1355":{"dur":3,"text":"and therefore the speech\nclarity doesn't drop off."},"1358":{"dur":2,"text":"- And I think another thing,\nwe've seen a few questions"},"1360":{"dur":3,"text":"come through talking about students"},"1364":{"dur":1,"text":"with other issues going on"},"1366":{"dur":2,"text":"and Dragon isn't a replacement for other"},"1368":{"dur":2,"text":"traditional therapies or other\napproaches that you'd use."},"1371":{"dur":2,"text":"So for a student with voice issues"},"1373":{"dur":2,"text":"you'd wanna be doing\nthings like vocal hygiene,"},"1376":{"dur":3,"text":"having water there and\nthose kind of things."},"1379":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's not a cure all\nas Shannon said earlier,"},"1382":{"dur":1,"text":"you wanna combine it or integrate it"},"1384":{"dur":2,"text":"into your therapy approach."},"1386":{"dur":1,"text":"- Okay, so the holistic approach."},"1388":{"dur":1,"text":"- A holistic approach, yes."},"1389":{"dur":0,"text":"Lovely buzzword.\n- [Derek] Do i get bonus"},"1390":{"dur":0,"text":"points for saying holistic?"},"1391":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughter)"},"1393":{"dur":3,"text":"Sorry Salah would like to know"},"1397":{"dur":1,"text":"which headset you recommended?"},"1398":{"dur":1,"text":"What brand or model I mean."},"1402":{"dur":2,"text":"- Really it's the features that we go for."},"1404":{"dur":2,"text":"The headset we use, or the\none that we've got here"},"1406":{"dur":1,"text":"is the Andrea headset."},"1408":{"dur":2,"text":"It's the NC 181 model."},"1410":{"dur":3,"text":"Again it's not the brand that matters"},"1414":{"dur":1,"text":"it's those features to look for"},"1415":{"dur":1,"text":"that we really search for."},"1417":{"dur":1,"text":"- So really just the noise cancelling?"},"1419":{"dur":1,"text":"- Noise cancelling, one ear, mute button."},"1421":{"dur":2,"text":"- Okay, there is a whole\nvariety of headsets"},"1423":{"dur":2,"text":"you can use that fit the characteristic."},"1425":{"dur":5,"text":"Often things like the size\nof the headset itself,"},"1430":{"dur":2,"text":"whether it fits the person\nyou're fitting it to and so on."},"1432":{"dur":2,"text":"Some of those things are\nimportant too quite often."},"1434":{"dur":1,"text":"And you're not limited to headsets,"},"1436":{"dur":1,"text":"have you ever used array microphones"},"1438":{"dur":1,"text":"or anything like that, has that ever?"},"1439":{"dur":1,"text":"- No we haven't ever."},"1440":{"dur":3,"text":"And the only issue we've had\nwith this headset in particular"},"1443":{"dur":3,"text":"is that these headsets\nare going into schoolbags"},"1447":{"dur":3,"text":"most of the time and\nthey're not necessarily"},"1451":{"dur":3,"text":"as robust as you would like for a student."},"1455":{"dur":3,"text":"- But we get hard cases\nand protect them that way."},"1459":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, there are actual\nlike, pencil cases,"},"1460":{"dur":1,"text":"we literally use pencil cases"},"1462":{"dur":2,"text":"and you can get some good\nones from Officeworks"},"1464":{"dur":2,"text":"and Smiggle and all\nsorts of cool things now."},"1466":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can actually\njust fold the headset,"},"1469":{"dur":2,"text":"not too much, but neatly in there,"},"1471":{"dur":1,"text":"and it gets chucked in the bag,"},"1472":{"dur":2,"text":"the headset's protected from the knocks"},"1475":{"dur":1,"text":"and the kicks and the things like that."},"1476":{"dur":1,"text":"- Interesting, thank you."},"1478":{"dur":2,"text":"- So moving onto training,\nit's a bit different"},"1481":{"dur":3,"text":"using Dragon with a student\nrather than with adults."},"1485":{"dur":2,"text":"I know that Shannon and I,\nafter that initial setup,"},"1487":{"dur":2,"text":"that we just talked you through,"},"1489":{"dur":2,"text":"our profiles were pretty much ready to go."},"1492":{"dur":1,"text":"We might have to correct\na few words here and there"},"1493":{"dur":3,"text":"where it mis-recognizes\nmaybe a word like dyslexia"},"1497":{"dur":2,"text":"that you need to put in\nbecause it's more specific"},"1499":{"dur":1,"text":"to your profession or something like that"},"1501":{"dur":2,"text":"but really we could\nhit the ground running."},"1504":{"dur":2,"text":"- And we were reading, we\nwere reading our profiles,"},"1506":{"dur":3,"text":"obviously as people who can\nread and write quite well."},"1509":{"dur":3,"text":"So yeah for students you've\ngot that added consideration."},"1512":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Mel] Yes, consideration.\n- [Derek] Sorry,"},"1514":{"dur":2,"text":"Do you know if the headset\ncan plug into an iPad as well?"},"1517":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Shannon] No.\n- [Derek] Most students."},"1518":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Mel] It's a USB.\n- [Shannon] It's USB."},"1520":{"dur":1,"text":"Which we actually like as well"},"1522":{"dur":2,"text":"rather than using that audio jack."},"1525":{"dur":2,"text":"- There's probably a new\niPad out very recently"},"1528":{"dur":1,"text":"that it might actually work with."},"1529":{"dur":1,"text":"- True, true."},"1532":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, so back onto training,"},"1534":{"dur":1,"text":"keep the questions rolling in though,"},"1537":{"dur":3,"text":"with these students it's\nunrealistic to expect"},"1541":{"dur":2,"text":"that after that initial\nsetup you will be able"},"1543":{"dur":2,"text":"to take it into the classroom\nstraight away that day"},"1545":{"dur":2,"text":"and get it up and running perfectly."},"1548":{"dur":2,"text":"Really it's a marathon not a sprint"},"1550":{"dur":3,"text":"and you need to help the\nstudents get the tech skills"},"1554":{"dur":3,"text":"to coordinate pressing the\nmicrophone and talking,"},"1557":{"dur":2,"text":"developing the dictation skill,"},"1559":{"dur":1,"text":"and developing the profile to learn"},"1561":{"dur":1,"text":"that student's way of speaking,"},"1563":{"dur":2,"text":"So we have used the software with students"},"1566":{"dur":1,"text":"who have unclear speech,"},"1567":{"dur":1,"text":"with students who have formulation issues,"},"1569":{"dur":2,"text":"so trouble thinking of what they wanna say"},"1571":{"dur":3,"text":"and putting it into a\ngrammatically correct sentence."},"1575":{"dur":1,"text":"So all of these things need to happen"},"1577":{"dur":2,"text":"in a safe, one on one\nenvironment, with someone who,"},"1580":{"dur":3,"text":"like Shannon or I knows how to get"},"1583":{"dur":3,"text":"the software to recognize\nthat student's voice."},"1587":{"dur":2,"text":"- And certainly we,\nit's not always the case"},"1589":{"dur":1,"text":"that it has to be a professional."},"1590":{"dur":2,"text":"A lot of the time we try\nand pass on our knowledge"},"1593":{"dur":2,"text":"to a parent because\nthey've got more access"},"1595":{"dur":2,"text":"to the student and it's\nmore cost effective."},"1598":{"dur":2,"text":"But there are times when\nthat's not an option"},"1600":{"dur":2,"text":"because we know, for\nexample, for dyslexia,"},"1603":{"dur":3,"text":"it's a genetic condition, so\nif you're taking on the role"},"1606":{"dur":2,"text":"of the trainer as the adult\nand your spelling skills"},"1609":{"dur":3,"text":"are about equal to the\nstudent you're trying to help,"},"1613":{"dur":1,"text":"then that's not going to work."},"1614":{"dur":3,"text":"So there are times for certain clients"},"1617":{"dur":2,"text":"that will extend the training\ntime when we have to,"},"1620":{"dur":2,"text":"when we have to help that\nstudent because perhaps"},"1623":{"dur":2,"text":"the parents don't have\nthe skills to do that."},"1626":{"dur":3,"text":"So again it's really\nindividual and variable."},"1629":{"dur":2,"text":"- But we have had success teaching parents"},"1631":{"dur":2,"text":"to be that trainer, or a\nteacher aide at school,"},"1634":{"dur":1,"text":"so it really is about collaborating"},"1636":{"dur":2,"text":"with the other people\nin that child's world."},"1639":{"dur":2,"text":"And just making sure everyone"},"1641":{"dur":1,"text":"feels supported in the process."},"1643":{"dur":2,"text":"And to expect things to go wrong."},"1645":{"dur":2,"text":"We're working with technology,\nwe're working with children,"},"1648":{"dur":2,"text":"things aren't going to be\nsmooth all of the time."},"1650":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's okay."},"1652":{"dur":1,"text":"So normally the training would happen"},"1653":{"dur":2,"text":"in a joint session with the\nstudent wearing the headset"},"1656":{"dur":3,"text":"and the Dragon trainer being there"},"1660":{"dur":2,"text":"to support the student."},"1662":{"dur":2,"text":"And you might need to start"},"1665":{"dur":2,"text":"scaffolding it to that student's level."},"1667":{"dur":3,"text":"Can they handle controlling\nthe microphone button"},"1670":{"dur":1,"text":"and talking at the same time?"},"1672":{"dur":1,"text":"Or do you need to be in charge"},"1673":{"dur":2,"text":"of that mute button or\nthat microphone button"},"1676":{"dur":3,"text":"and just let them think of\nwhat they're talking about?"},"1680":{"dur":1,"text":"- And I think sometime\nwe also find we have"},"1681":{"dur":2,"text":"to sometimes get them to say that,"},"1684":{"dur":3,"text":"that practice out loud\nfirst what they want to say."},"1687":{"dur":2,"text":"Eventually you fade these things out"},"1689":{"dur":1,"text":"but we'll get them to practice\nwhat they're going to say"},"1691":{"dur":1,"text":"before they say it and then we'll go,"},"1692":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Okay, so I'm gonna hold the\nbutton, you're gonna say\","},"1695":{"dur":2,"text":"and you'll give them the first\nthree words of their sentence"},"1697":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's enough to get them rolling."},"1699":{"dur":2,"text":"And eventually you're\nfading those things out"},"1701":{"dur":1,"text":"and they're doing those\nthings on their own"},"1703":{"dur":2,"text":"but sometimes you need\nto go down to that level."},"1705":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, and make sure the student"},"1707":{"dur":1,"text":"doesn't feel overloaded."},"1708":{"dur":2,"text":"But we've also had the\nexperience where you get a kid"},"1711":{"dur":2,"text":"who's all over the\ntechnology side of things."},"1713":{"dur":1,"text":"I've had grade fours put the headset on,"},"1714":{"dur":2,"text":"they're like, \"I've got the\nbutton\", and away they go."},"1717":{"dur":2,"text":"And kids with really strong\noral language skills,"},"1720":{"dur":1,"text":"you can't stop them."},"1721":{"dur":3,"text":"And they'll be saying sentences at a time,"},"1724":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's really encouraging to see that,"},"1726":{"dur":1,"text":"but just be aware that\neach student's different"},"1728":{"dur":2,"text":"and that as the trainer it's your job"},"1731":{"dur":3,"text":"to make it a stress free\nprocess for that student"},"1734":{"dur":2,"text":"and to gauge, \"Are we\ntrying to do too much?"},"1737":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Are we overloading them\nwith our expectations?\""},"1739":{"dur":2,"text":"- So if I could summarize\nthat in a nutshell"},"1742":{"dur":1,"text":"it's not gonna be,"},"1744":{"dur":1,"text":"and we don't just get this\nwith kids, by the way,"},"1746":{"dur":1,"text":"for Dragon, we get people\nwho want to take it"},"1747":{"dur":1,"text":"out of the box and use it straight away."},"1749":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's been the case for a long time."},"1751":{"dur":2,"text":"The technology still isn't that easy,"},"1753":{"dur":3,"text":"there's Dragon for adults now\nis about as easy at it can,"},"1757":{"dur":2,"text":"well it's very easy, it works\nvery well out of the box."},"1759":{"dur":2,"text":"But if you're buying it\nfor a child or a student"},"1761":{"dur":2,"text":"then you may need to be prepared"},"1764":{"dur":1,"text":"to work through the kind of process"},"1765":{"dur":1,"text":"you've just heard described."},"1767":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's gonna be very much tailored"},"1768":{"dur":1,"text":"for what that individual can handle"},"1770":{"dur":3,"text":"and how the best way of working\nwith them can be set up."},"1773":{"dur":2,"text":"- And I guess

either."},"2006":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yeah, as the profile gets more accurate"},"2008":{"dur":2,"text":"you don't really need to\nbe correcting everything"},"2011":{"dur":2,"text":"but you want the

export"},"2066":{"dur":3,"text":"in that you should take it off\nthe computer that you've got"},"2069":{"dur":2,"text":"because if something\nhappens to the program"},"2072":{"dur":2,"text":"and you

most"},"2132":{"dur":3,"text":"is that we are by giving\nthese tools to students"},"2135":{"dur":3,"text":"somehow giving them too much of a leg up"},"2139":{"dur":5,"text":"and that this is letting them cheat"},"2144":{"dur":3,"text":"and get around whatever\ntheir difficulties are."},"2147":{"dur":2,"text":"And I would say yes, yes it is."},"2149":{"dur":2,"text":"That is, that is the point."},"2151":{"dur":1,"text":"- Does that come from the perspective"},"2152":{"dur":1,"text":"of their getting an\nadvantage over students"},"2154":{"dur":1,"text":"without those difficulties\nor from the point"},"2156":{"dur":2,"text":"that they really should be\nlearning to do it the proper way?"},"2158":{"dur":1,"text":"- A bit of both, a bit of both."},"2160":{"dur":1,"text":"There's very much\nespecially, \"Well why should"},"2162":{"dur":2,"text":"\"this student have it\nand not this student?\""},"2164":{"dur":3,"text":"And I guess that comes\ndown to funding issues"},"2168":{"dur":1,"text":"a lot of the time unfortunately."},"2169":{"dur":2,"text":"But what we are just saying is,"},"2172":{"dur":1,"text":"what we're trying to do with students"},"2173":{"dur":4,"text":"with definable, diagnosable,\nneurological impairments,"},"2178":{"dur":1,"text":"and we know, for example, dyslexia"},"2180":{"dur":1,"text":"is a neurological impairment."},"2181":{"dur":4,"text":"We can stick brains, people,\ninto functional MRI machines"},"2186":{"dur":4,"text":"and see that they're not\nlighting up in the correct areas."},"2191":{"dur":3,"text":"So we know it's an actual\nprocessing problem."},"2194":{"dur":3,"text":"What we're doing here is not actually..."},"2198":{"dur":1,"text":"- It's not an unfair advantage."},"2199":{"dur":3,"text":"- No, we're actually providing\nthat equality of education."},"2202":{"dur":3,"text":"And the point of education\nis to allow students"},"2206":{"dur":2,"text":"to reach their potential\nnot to reach the potential"},"2208":{"dur":1,"text":"of the student sitting next to them."},"2210":{"dur":2,"text":"So we have real issues with that,"},"2212":{"dur":2,"text":"and I guess it comes back to the ideas"},"2215":{"dur":3,"text":"of disability standards and inclusiveness"},"2218":{"dur":2,"text":"and differentiation\nwhich are big buzzwords"},"2221":{"dur":1,"text":"in education at the moment."},"2223":{"dur":1,"text":"And it should be about what does"},"2224":{"dur":3,"text":"that student need to succeed\nor to reach their potential?"},"2228":{"dur":2,"text":"So for us it's more about equality"},"2230":{"dur":2,"text":"than some kind of leg up or\ntoo much of an advantage."},"2233":{"dur":2,"text":"- Right, I've seen strange\nthings like students"},"2235":{"dur":2,"text":"with visual impairments who are allowed"},"2237":{"dur":2,"text":"to have a scribe, for example,\nin exams to write everything"},"2240":{"dur":1,"text":"but they're not allowed to use Dragon,"},"2241":{"dur":2,"text":"which doesn't make a lot of sense to me."},"2243":{"dur":2,"text":"- And this is where I think,\nit's one of those instances,"},"2246":{"dur":3,"text":"especially in Australia,\nwhere legislation policy"},"2250":{"dur":3,"text":"within educational institutions\nreally needs to step up"},"2253":{"dur":2,"text":"because it's not reflecting"},"2257":{"dur":1,"text":"what we see as our goals."},"2259":{"dur":2,"text":"The point of using this technology"},"2262":{"dur":2,"text":"and not using a reader or\na scribe is independence."},"2265":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's really important for students"},"2268":{"dur":2,"text":"with varying difficulties to have"},"2270":{"dur":1,"text":"that level of independence."},"2272":{"dur":2,"text":"They can't carry around another human"},"2275":{"dur":2,"text":"for the rest of their life\nto read and scribe for them."},"2277":{"dur":2,"text":"So why would we set them\nup with those strategies"},"2279":{"dur":2,"text":"for education if they're not going to able"},"2282":{"dur":1,"text":"to carry them through in life."},"2283":{"dur":3,"text":"So for us independence with\nassistive technology is key."},"2286":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's, our philosophy\nis that education"},"2290":{"dur":1,"text":"should be setting students up for life"},"2292":{"dur":2,"text":"not so that they can pass tests."},"2294":{"dur":3,"text":"And I guess that's something\nwe get really passionate about."},"2299":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's usually not the people\nwho work within the systems"},"2304":{"dur":2,"text":"that are the issue it's\ngetting those systems"},"2306":{"dur":2,"text":"to reflect what's actually happening"},"2308":{"dur":2,"text":"in the classrooms at the\nmoment, at the very moment."},"2311":{"dur":2,"text":"- Are there any, I know for example,"},"2313":{"dur":3,"text":"I think in Tasmania\nthere were some schools"},"2316":{"dur":1,"text":"that were abusing, allowed to use Dragon"},"2318":{"dur":1,"text":"for examination sittings."},"2320":{"dur":1,"text":"Are there any systems or places"},"2321":{"dur":2,"text":"which seem to have it\nparticularly down well?"},"2323":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, and it's really\ninteresting because"},"2325":{"dur":1,"text":"obviously we work in a smaller area."},"2327":{"dur":2,"text":"You can go five ks one\nway and have a school"},"2330":{"dur":3,"text":"that will not allow it\nto be used for exams"},"2333":{"dur":2,"text":"and move five ks in the other\ndirection it's not an issue."},"2336":{"dur":2,"text":"- And I think we've found that it's more"},"2339":{"dur":2,"text":"about communicating well with the teachers"},"2342":{"dur":2,"text":"and the school staff and the parents"},"2344":{"dur":3,"text":"and everyone being on board\nand feeling supported."},"2348":{"dur":2,"text":"Where I think it falls down is that"},"2350":{"dur":2,"text":"a child's taken the\nsoftware into the classroom"},"2353":{"dur":2,"text":"and the teacher's kind of got,"},"2356":{"dur":2,"text":"been given this unrealistic expectation"},"2358":{"dur":1,"text":"that that student should use that"},"2360":{"dur":1,"text":"and then something goes wrong."},"2361":{"dur":2,"text":"And no one really knows what to do"},"2363":{"dur":1,"text":"and feels like it's a failure."},"2365":{"dur":2,"text":"So we often do transitioning school visits"},"2367":{"dur":4,"text":"to sit in with students and\nanswer any teacher's questions."},"2371":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think it's a process\nand as long as you're"},"2374":{"dur":1,"text":"supporting everyone\nthroughout that process"},"2376":{"dur":1,"text":"and troubleshooting as you go"},"2378":{"dur":2,"text":"it can make it smoother\nand more successful."},"2380":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Shannon] Yeah.\n- [Derek] So that conference"},"2381":{"dur":1,"text":"we met at, we were talking earlier"},"2383":{"dur":2,"text":"about one

actually\nwent and heard a talk by,"},"2393":{"dur":2,"text":"I think she was 16 or 17 years old,"},"2395":{"dur":2,"text":"a student who described how she\nused Dragon in the

other thing that we,\noh before we touch on that,"},"2421":{"dur":2,"text":"was the other thing we get\nwhich is linked to that"},"2423":{"dur":3,"text":"assistance versus equality\nis that people are worried"},"2426":{"dur":1,"text":"about students using this technology"},"2428":{"dur":1,"text":"and losing handwriting skills,"},"2429":{"dur":3,"text":"and losing the drive to write or to read."},"2433":{"dur":2,"text":"And we, it's actually the opposite."},"2435":{"dur":2,"text":"We get them engaging with text more"},"2437":{"dur":3,"text":"which is important for fixing

writing,"},"2449":{"dur":2,"text":"even if they don't have\nphysical difficulties,"},"2451":{"dur":1,"text":"but because of their\nspelling they just don't"},"2453":{"dur":1,"text":"get through the

is\nwhat are they missing out"},"2460":{"dur":2,"text":"on by not using the software."},"2463":{"dur":1,"text":"And really what kind of workplaces"},"2465":{"dur":1,"text":"are we setting these students up for?"},"2467":{"dur":2,"text":"There are very few workplaces now"},"2469":{"dur":3,"text":"where handwriting is necessary."},"2472":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's also we're in that\nreally transition period,"},"2475":{"dur":2,"text":"we no longer use calligraphy,"},"2478":{"dur":2,"text":"that's a dying, it's a dead art."},"2480":{"dur":2,"text":"- Well Finland for example\nwhere

it."},"2488":{"dur":3,"text":"They focus on print and typing skills"},"2491":{"dur":3,"text":"because that's what the world\nis requiring of students now."},"2496":{"dur":2,"text":"- And at a

that was my main concern,"},"2505":{"dur":0,"text":"how does that work?"},"2506":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, so Shannon, take it away."},"2508":{"dur":3,"text":"- So our big, big push\nis no pullout

side."},"2551":{"dur":1,"text":"- To the side at the back, yeah."},"2552":{"dur":2,"text":"Really what that does is means that"},"2554":{"dur":1,"text":"they don't feel like they're being
