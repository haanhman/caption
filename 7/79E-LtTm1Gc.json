lot of energy,"},"1069":{"dur":1,"text":"and you're good at marketing yourself."},"1071":{"dur":2,"text":"But what about those who don't?"},"1073":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, that's a serious problem, and,"},"1075":{"dur":3,"text":"I totally have the answers, not, so."},"1079":{"dur":1,"text":"But I think I mean, it's important for us"},"1081":{"dur":2,"text":"to raise these issues,

way."},"1111":{"dur":1,"text":"So, I am, so,"},"1114":{"dur":2,"text":"so here's, I'm going to show a few,"},"1117":{"dur":1,"text":"a few of the things I've been working on,"},"1118":{"dur":1,"text":"and then I'll throw it open to questions."},"1119":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'm really open, by the way, to anything about anything."},"1123":{"dur":2,"text":"So, almost anything, but."},"1126":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughter)"},"1127":{"dur":1,"text":"If I don't want to answer, I just won't answer."},"1128":{"dur":3,"text":"So these are, this is my latest, it's a graphic

before."},"1151":{"dur":3,"text":"And quite frankly, I did this book largely for,"},"1155":{"dur":2,"text":"aside from the fact that I thought it would be interesting,"},"1157":{"dur":3,"text":"I also thought it'd be a really interesting"},"1160":{"dur":2,"text":"way to make some money, because there had never been"},"1162":{"dur":1,"text":"a biography of Edward Snowden before,"},"1164":{"dur":2,"text":"and I thought people would buy it, because of the topic."},"1167":{"dur":2,"text":"And so there's an economic consideration here,"},"1170":{"dur":3,"text":"that is important to acknowledge, I think."},"1174":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, authors, artists, authors and artists"},"1177":{"dur":3,"text":"like to say, like, they pretend like everything's all pure,"},"1180":{"dur":2,"text":"and you know, we just follow our muse."},"1183":{"dur":2,"text":"And our muses are important, but you know,"},"1186":{"dur":2,"text":"we have bills to pay, too."},"1188":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is, this is sort of an opening, about 1984,"},"1193":{"dur":4,"text":"and how the surveillance state that was painted,"},"1197":{"dur":2,"text":"that was created under, in Oceania,"},"1201":{"dur":4,"text":"the fictional world of Oceania, in Orwell's imagination."},"1207":{"dur":1,"text":"And you know, everything, everybody's all,"},"1209":{"dur":2,"text":"the government's always watching everyone,"},"1211":{"dur":3,"text":"people in their apartments are seen through their TV,"},"1215":{"dur":1,"text":"which is called a telescreen, where the

anymore."},"1223":{"dur":4,"text":"And it reduces them to something less than fully human."},"1228":{"dur":4,"text":"And as Edward Snowden showed us, in the summer of 2013,"},"1235":{"dur":3,"text":"we do live in Oceania in the United States,"},"1238":{"dur":2,"text":"even though very few people really are aware"},"1240":{"dur":1,"text":"of the full extent of these programs."},"1242":{"dur":2,"text":"One of the, when I started trying to work on the book,"},"1245":{"dur":2,"text":"I took, trying to figure out a way to get into it."},"1247":{"dur":1,"text":"I was talking to people I met,"},"1249":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Oh, my next project's about Edward Snowden.\""},"1251":{"dur":1,"text":"And people were like, \"Who?\""},"1252":{"dur":4,"text":"And I thought it was the most important story of my time."},"1257":{"dur":1,"text":"I thought it was a bigger story than 9\/11,"},"1258":{"dur":1,"text":"because it revealed the relationship"},"1260":{"dur":3,"text":"between the U.S. government and its, and the people."},"1264":{"dur":2,"text":"And I realized that people didn't really know"},"1267":{"dur":3,"text":"the extent of the pro, of these programs,"},"1270":{"dur":2,"text":"and how wide ranging they are."},"1273":{"dur":2,"text":"So you know, for example, the only thing"},"1276":{"dur":1,"text":"that people are really talking about"},"1277":{"dur":2,"text":"is the telephony metadata program,"},"1279":{"dur":2,"text":"which is, basically, the stuff on your phone bill,"},"1281":{"dur":2,"text":"like what time you called, were you were,"},"1284":{"dur":1,"text":"how long the call was, who you called,"},"1285":{"dur":1,"text":"where they were when you called them."},"1287":{"dur":1,"text":"And whether they were on a cell phone,"},"1288":{"dur":2,"text":"or whether it was a land line."},"1291":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that's the only thing that Obama or Congress"},"1294":{"dur":1,"text":"have debated or discussed at all,"},"1295":{"dur":1,"text":"in terms of possible reform."},"1297":{"dur":1,"text":"And the defenders of that program,"},"1299":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean, it, say that it doesn't intercept your phone call."},"1304":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's true, because they have another program"},"1307":{"dur":2,"text":"that intercepts the phone calls, and then,"},"1310":{"dur":1,"text":"the defenders of that program say,"},"1312":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Well, that doesn't record the phone calls.\""},"1314":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's true, because they have another program"},"1316":{"dur":2,"text":"that records and stores the phone calls."},"1319":{"dur":2,"text":"And the, I think people don't recognize"},"1321":{"dur":2,"text":"how incredibly wide ranging this is."},"1324":{"dur":2,"text":"We're talking about every phone call in the United States,"},"1326":{"dur":3,"text":"by everybody in this room, period, 100.0% of all,"},"1330":{"dur":4,"text":"everybody's phone calls in the U.S, all the time, 24\/7."},"1334":{"dur":2,"text":"But you're also talking about all your text messages,"},"1336":{"dur":2,"text":"your voice over internet phone calls,"},"1338":{"dur":3,"text":"Skype, even your Netflix streaming habits."},"1342":{"dur":3,"text":"The NSA complains that they are spending"},"1345":{"dur":2,"text":"billions of dollars storing people's NSA stream,"},"1348":{"dur":1,"text":"their Netflix streams."},"1350":{"dur":1,"text":"And so, you know, you really, you know,"},"1352":{"dur":2,"text":"it never occurs to anyone, they don't really have to store"},"1354":{"dur":2,"text":"all those Games of Thrones, we just need the one copy."},"1356":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughter)"},"1358":{"dur":0,"text":"And so,"},"1360":{"dur":1,"text":"this sort of shows how a graphic novel"},"1361":{"dur":2,"text":"can be used to explain, you know,"},"1364":{"dur":2,"text":"kind of complicated issues in a simpler way."},"1367":{"dur":1,"text":"Glenn Greenwald did a very good book"},"1368":{"dur":2,"text":"called \"No Place to Hide,\" about"},"1371":{"dur":2,"text":"the NSA revelations of Edward Snowden."},"1374":{"dur":3,"text":"And I love the book, but I think it could have benefited"},"1378":{"dur":4,"text":"by more graphics, from more graphics, and to break it down."},"1382":{"dur":4,"text":"This was an attempt to do it in sort of a YA kind of way."},"1387":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, you know, you see these charts,"},"1390":{"dur":1,"text":"sorry for those of you in the back,"},"1391":{"dur":1,"text":"that's what you get for sitting in the back."},"1393":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughter)"},"1395":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, the teacher never calls on you, but."},"1399":{"dur":2,"text":"So yeah, and so then this is like, for example,"},"1402":{"dur":3,"text":"the metaphor that the NSA uses about how,"},"1405":{"dur":2,"text":"previously, before 9\/11, law enforcement"},"1408":{"dur":3,"text":"was trying to search for a terrorist needle in a haystack."},"1411":{"dur":3,"text":"And now, what they do is, they gather the entire haystack,"},"1415":{"dur":2,"text":"they store it in a data farm in Utah,"},"1417":{"dur":4,"text":"so that they can sort through it at their leisure."},"1423":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you've gotten emails that you lost,"},"1425":{"dur":2,"text":"or something, you can just call them and get it."},"1427":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughter)"},"1428":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a courtesy."},"1432":{"dur":2,"text":"There's all sorts of programs no one knows about,"},"1435":{"dur":2,"text":"like if you have a smart TV,"},"1437":{"dur":2,"text":"how many people have a smart TV?"},"1440":{"dur":3,"text":"Not many, woah, poor college community, you gotta."},"1443":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughter)"},"1444":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, once you, so."},"1445":{"dur":2,"text":"So yeah, well, your next TV will be a smart TV,"},"1448":{"dur":2,"text":"and a smart TV is a telescreen."},"1450":{"dur":2,"text":"It is used by the NSA to look at people"},"1452":{"dur":2,"text":"in their homes, Snowden has shown us that."},"1455":{"dur":3,"text":"There also, he, there's a program called Captived Audience,"},"1458":{"dur":2,"text":"in which the NSA can turn on your cell phone,"},"1461":{"dur":3,"text":"and you turn on the mic, and listen to you in your home."},"1464":{"dur":2,"text":"Even if there's no power on the phone,"},"1466":{"dur":3,"text":"they can still do that with the residual power."},"1470":{"dur":2,"text":"And then there's a program called Gumfish"},"1472":{"dur":2,"text":"that will turn on the camera on your laptop,"},"1474":{"dur":3,"text":"or on your desktop computer, and look at you in your home."},"1478":{"dur":2,"text":"So 1984 really, really is here."},"1481":{"dur":2,"text":"There's Game of Thrones."},"1483":{"dur":2,"text":"So, yeah, so this is, you know,"},"1485":{"dur":1,"text":"this is kind of what it looks like."},"1487":{"dur":3,"text":"It's an exploration of Snowden, and his biography,"},"1491":{"dur":2,"text":"and where he came from, and,"},"1494":{"dur":1,"text":"why he did what he did, and I'm not going to get"},"1496":{"dur":2,"text":"into all that, we can, if there's questions about Snowden,"},"1498":{"dur":4,"text":"we can talk about him, Snowden as Le Petit Prince."},"1502":{"dur":1,"text":"Because he was kind of naive, he was a,"},"1504":{"dur":3,"text":"like, right wing Libertarian, and, before,"},"1508":{"dur":4,"text":"oh, too, he said that whistleblowers should be shot."},"1513":{"dur":2,"text":"The impetuate, that's the next book."},"1515":{"dur":2,"text":"It's going to be about Mr. Sanders,"},"1517":{"dur":2,"text":"who I interviewed last week in Washington."},"1519":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm going to, there's another one of these,"},"1522":{"dur":3,"text":"and I'll sort of just get ready for questions."},"1528":{"dur":0,"text":"Okay."},"1534":{"dur":2,"text":"All right so, I used, I do,"},"1537":{"dur":1,"text":"these are just sort of some examples of, like,"},"1538":{"dur":2,"text":"the variety of work that I do."},"1541":{"dur":3,"text":"The short, for short, these are, this is a short form comic"},"1544":{"dur":3,"text":"for a website called aNewDomain.net, that I'm full time at."},"1548":{"dur":2,"text":"So, you have to have a million jobs, as I said."},"1551":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's kind of fun, because you get to work"},"1553":{"dur":1,"text":"in different formats."},"1555":{"dur":2,"text":"This would be a, you know,"},"1557":{"dur":1,"text":"about who, my tasteless attempt to make,"},"1559":{"dur":3,"text":"to make light of ISIS beheadings, because in cartooning,"},"1563":{"dur":3,"text":"beheadings are always funny, by definition."},"1568":{"dur":1,"text":"Then, this is, yeah again, sort of a,"},"1570":{"dur":4,"text":"this is a short form, like, single panel editorial cartoon."},"1575":{"dur":3,"text":"Again, about the war in Syria, and how the U.S. Armed"},"1578":{"dur":3,"text":"helped arm ISIS, and how we're fighting them with,"},"1582":{"dur":3,"text":"they're shooting at us with our own bullets."},"1586":{"dur":3,"text":"Obama walking down the street, like with, you know,"},"1590":{"dur":3,"text":"after he's, after he's no longer President,"},"1593":{"dur":3,"text":"and how he might be harassed by cops."},"1596":{"dur":2,"text":"This was the shooting in, got it."},"1601":{"dur":2,"text":"There's so many of these police shootings,"},"1603":{"dur":3,"text":"I actually forgot which one this one, this is Ferguson."},"1607":{"dur":2,"text":"So yeah, in Ferguson, Missouri."},"1609":{"dur":2,"text":"The cops were, one of the things"},"1612":{"dur":2,"text":"that the cops said was that,"},"1615":{"dur":3,"text":"that they were not shooting everybody that they could."},"1618":{"dur":1,"text":"So, that was part of their defense."},"1620":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is sort of the format."},"1625":{"dur":1,"text":"And then, like, this would,"},"1627":{"dur":2,"text":"then there's like long form editorial cartoons."},"1629":{"dur":4,"text":"These go out through syndication, so multiple panels."},"1639":{"dur":2,"text":"Then more short form, these are"},"1641":{"dur":2,"text":"editorial cartoons, syndicated."},"1645":{"dur":2,"text":"I was, (laughs)"},"1648":{"dur":2,"text":"yeah, you see, when you still laugh at your own cartoon,"},"1651":{"dur":3,"text":"you're either crazy, or it's a good cartoon."},"1654":{"dur":1,"text":"Or both, maybe."},"1657":{"dur":1,"text":"So, two ISIS guys hanging out."},"1658":{"dur":1,"text":"\"These Americans have to be

of,"},"1691":{"dur":2,"text":"must satire always be funny, no."},"1694":{"dur":2,"text":"Satire does not need to be funny at all."},"1697":{"dur":2,"text":"It certainly pays better (coughs) when it is,"},"1700":{"dur":3,"text":"but here's an example of when it's not."},"1713":{"dur":2,"text":"So, that was the punch line, you're supposed to laugh."},"1715":{"dur":0,"text":"Okay."},"1718":{"dur":1,"text":"And so, I am just going to sort of"},"1719":{"dur":1,"text":"skip through a bunch of these,"},"1721":{"dur":2,"text":"because it's kind of long, oh yeah."},"1723":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is, to me, another example of,"},"1725":{"dur":1,"text":"like, satire can be anything."},"1727":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is from the Blue Mosque,"},"1730":{"dur":3,"text":"photo of the Blue Mosque in Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan."},"1733":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's, you know, \"Please off your mobile.\""},"1736":{"dur":3,"text":"And, you know, even, even in a war zone,"},"1740":{"dur":3,"text":"this is a problem, everybody's on their phone."},"1743":{"dur":2,"text":"So, that's The Three Amigos, me,"},"1746":{"dur":2,"text":"and Matt Bors, and Steven Cloud, and we."},"1748":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is another example of a way I make a living."},"1750":{"dur":2,"text":"I do occasional war correspondency in,"},"1753":{"dur":1,"text":"I've been to Afghanistan a number of times,"},"1755":{"dur":2,"text":"and most recently, in 2011."},"1759":{"dur":2,"text":"And we went native, sort of,"},"1762":{"dur":1,"text":"which turned out to be a bad move,"},"1763":{"dur":3,"text":"because it turned out that we were arrested for being,"},"1766":{"dur":3,"text":"we were accused of being potential terrorists."},"1769":{"dur":2,"text":"Better to just dress like this."},"1772":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, here's the beginning of a book"},"1775":{"dur":3,"text":"that came out of that, so, books, very important part of."},"1778":{"dur":2,"text":"But you can't make a living just from doing books anymore,"},"1781":{"dur":2,"text":"which is kind of remarkable, even a successful book,"},"1783":{"dur":1,"text":"it's hard to make a living."},"1785":{"dur":2,"text":"So this book started out with sort of,"},"1787":{"dur":4,"text":"this is about, it's comics journalism from Afghanistan,"},"1792":{"dur":4,"text":"from 2001 to 2011, and it starts out with a history"},"1796":{"dur":4,"text":"of the U.S. occupation of Afghanistan, beginning after 9\/11."},"1800":{"dur":2,"text":"And it, you can sort of see how it, even if you're a,"},"1803":{"dur":1,"text":"well, maybe if you're in the back, I don't know."},"1805":{"dur":2,"text":"You can sort of see how you can use"},"1807":{"dur":3,"text":"the comics journalism form to show things"},"1810":{"dur":2,"text":"that would have to be, might be kind of dull,"},"1812":{"dur":3,"text":"or hard to follow, in prose, which I also work in."},"1816":{"dur":4,"text":"But you know, words don't look so exciting on a PowerPoint."},"1821":{"dur":4,"text":"So, this sort of lays out the origins of that war."},"1828":{"dur":3,"text":"And then this is a layout of a typical page."},"1833":{"dur":1,"text":"Oh, campaign posters"},"1834":{"dur":4,"text":"from the Parliamentary elections in Afghanistan."},"1840":{"dur":1,"text":"And so you can do, like, funny things."},"1842":{"dur":1,"text":"There's humor in all sorts of things."},"1844":{"dur":2,"text":"So, for example, there was,"},"1846":{"dur":2,"text":"we were fascinated by food in Afghanistan,"},"1849":{"dur":4,"text":"and you know, the occupation has really influenced"},"1854":{"dur":2,"text":"Afghan food, and one of the things we noticed was that"},"1857":{"dur":3,"text":"there were Afghan versions of American food."},"1860":{"dur":2,"text":"And we were fascinated by this, so I did a

like,"},"1912":{"dur":3,"text":"one of them was \"Don't miss Herat's famous Burger Tube!\""},"1916":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, in every place we went,"},"1919":{"dur":4,"text":"the bottom bun was always

thousands."},"2611":{"dur":2,"text":"And what's happening is that, like,"},"2613":{"dur":1,"text":"it's just like, it's sort of the Fox News effect,"},"2615":{"dur":2,"text":"where you know, people who watch Fox News"},"2617":{"dur":1,"text":"think that Benghazi's a huge story."},"2619":{"dur":3,"text":"People who watch MSNBC never hear anything about Benghazi."},"2622":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, there's, you have the same thing,"},"2626":{"dur":2,"text":"where there are people who only read"},"2628":{"dur":4,"text":"a very small segment of views, and those, and for them,"},"2633":{"dur":2,"text":"they're like, they want to read what they agree with."},"2636":{"dur":2,"text":"And so there's not a lot of cross pollinization."},"2638":{"dur":2,"text":"So yeah, there's more, there's sort of"},"2640":{"dur":3,"text":"more wild and crazy views, and there's no one."},"2643":{"dur":1,"text":"Also, with the lack of editors,"},"2645":{"dur":2,"text":"because people are just on websites,"},"2648":{"dur":2,"text":"and promoting their work, there's no one"},"2650":{"dur":2,"text":"who's kind of serving, and this cuts both ways,"},"2652":{"dur":1,"text":"there's no one censoring them,"},"2654":{"dur":1,"text":"but there's no one editing them."},"2656":{"dur":3,"text":"So if people say really crazy and stupid, or wrong stuff,"},"2659":{"dur":1,"text":"it still goes out there, and then peop,"},"2661":{"dur":1,"text":"a lot of people read it and they're like,"},"2662":{"dur":2,"text":"they think it's right, or true, so."},"2665":{"dur":3,"text":"It's, that's just the nature, I think, of the culture."},"2669":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, there's more books than there've ever been,"},"2673":{"dur":2,"text":"every year,

is, that's not why his approval rating"},"3278":{"dur":2,"text":"was under 20% by the time he left office."},"3281":{"dur":4,"text":"It's like you know, he had been relentlessly

and obviously, it's gone,"},"3659":{"dur":3,"text":"it's developed a lot more since then."},"3663":{"dur":2,"text":"But I remember, like, I took some of the same classes,"},"3665":{"dur":2,"text":"I had to, because I failed them the first time."},"3668":{"dur":2,"text":"And so for, you know Columbia University"},"3671":{"dur":2,"text":"has this core curriculum, so it's like,"},"3673":{"dur":1,"text":"you know, the Great Men."},"3674":{"dur":2,"text":"And, in other words, people who looked"},"3677":{"dur":2,"text":"like me, but with wigs, and they,"},"3679":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughter)"},"3681":{"dur":1,"text":"and they were, and you know,"},"3682":{"dur":3,"text":"so you kind of like, it's, I'm torn."},"3685":{"dur":0,"text":"It's kind of

it's like, but, we're, you know,"},"3693":{"dur":1,"text":"going to have Toni Morrison instead."},"3695":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'm like, that's cool, you know."},"3696":{"dur":3,"text":"It's like, I prefer other African American writers more,"},"3700":{"dur":1,"text":"but whatever, but the point is,"},"3702":{"dur":2,"text":"you can see the change, and it was like, you know,"},"3704":{"dur":2,"text":"it's a wash, and I really think it's one of those things."},"3707":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, for an opinionated guy,"},"3709":{"dur":2,"text":"I really can see this both ways."},"3711":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, I think,"},"3714":{"dur":3,"text":"you know, it's really awesome to see"},"3717":{"dur":3,"text":"non-white-males, and heternormative

equals."},"3730":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's long, obviously, it's 450 years overdue."},"3736":{"dur":3,"text":"And so that's great, and this is part of that process."},"3739":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, I mean, it's great for, you know,"},"3741":{"dur":3,"text":"guys like me to have to think twice about what we say."},"3745":{"dur":2,"text":"It can be a little exhausting, too sometimes,"},"3747":{"dur":1,"text":"because you're not always keeping up."},"3749":{"dur":2,"text":"And you see people get, sometimes, beaten up"},"3751":{"dur":3,"text":"over saying something that really wasn't bad."},"3755":{"dur":3,"text":"There was this, I guess that British scientist"},"3759":{"dur":1,"text":"that happened, too, recently."},"3761":{"dur":2,"text":"And you know, he was really, if you,"},"3763":{"dur":3,"text":"I forget his name, anyone know, I don't remember?"},"3766":{"dur":2,"text":"He was, it was a big, controversial thing,"},"3768":{"dur":4,"text":"and he got misquoted in social media for saying that,"},"3773":{"dur":2,"text":"basically, he didn't want to have any women in his lab"},"3776":{"dur":3,"text":"because he was risk falling in love with them, right."},"3779":{"dur":3,"text":"And it was like, oh, what a sexist pig."},"3782":{"dur":3,"text":"And he was thrown, he lost his gig as a pro,"},"3786":{"dur":2,"text":"as a emeritus professor at, in,"},"3789":{"dur":1,"text":"I forget which college, I think it's,"},"3790":{"dur":1,"text":"some, anyway, I don't remember."},"3792":{"dur":1,"text":"Anyway the point is, it was a big thing."},"3794":{"dur":1,"text":"And it turns out, you know,"},"3795":{"dur":1,"text":"once you scratch the surface of it,"},"3796":{"dur":1,"text":"that it was completely unfair, I mean,"},"3798":{"dur":3,"text":"this guy was not a sexist, in fact, there were,"},"3802":{"dur":2,"text":"was just a litany of female scientists"},"3804":{"dur":2,"text":"who said that he was a complete champion of their work,"},"3807":{"dur":2,"text":"he was like the least sexist guy ever,"},"3809":{"dur":3,"text":"he was promoting them, his wife, he's a stay at home."},"3813":{"dur":3,"text":"Like he, like, his wife is like more prominent than he is."},"3816":{"dur":3,"text":"And he stays home and cooks, and takes care of the kids."},"3820":{"dur":2,"text":"So you know what I mean, he's just not a pig, okay."},"3822":{"dur":2,"text":"And just, and he got misquoted."},"3824":{"dur":1,"text":"And then he's like, the guy's destroyed."},"3826":{"dur":1,"text":"Like, they're not going to take him back."},"3827":{"dur":2,"text":"It's over, he'll never be a scientist again."},"3830":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's frightening, I know that's not in the,"},"3832":{"dur":2,"text":"that's not a college thing, but it kind of is."},"3834":{"dur":0,"text":"And,"},"3836":{"dur":3,"text":"so you know, I mean, it's like any social movement."},"3840":{"dur":2,"text":"It can go too far, you can get, you know,"},"3843":{"dur":4,"text":"you have a French Revolution that overthrows the monarchy,"},"3847":{"dur":1,"text":"which really needed to go, but you know,"},"3849":{"dur":2,"text":"you can get, that guillotine can kind of work overtime."},"3852":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think that's just, you will see some of that."},"3856":{"dur":3,"text":"And I, I think it's like really great to be sensitive,"},"3860":{"dur":2,"text":"but I also think that people have to be able"},"3862":{"dur":2,"text":"to have a wild
