began."},"18":{"dur":2,"text":"The economy continues to expand at a moderate pace."},"21":{"dur":2,"text":"Unfortunately, however, unemployment remains high."},"24":{"dur":3,"text":"About 5 million people-more than 40 percent of the unemployed-have been"},"28":{"dur":3,"text":"without a job for six months or more, and millions more who say they would"},"32":{"dur":3,"text":"like full-time work have been able to find only part-time employment"},"36":{"dur":1,"text":"or have stopped looking entirely."},"39":{"dur":3,"text":"The conditions now prevailing in the job market represent an enormous waste"},"43":{"dur":1,"text":"of human and economic potential."},"46":{"dur":3,"text":"A return to broad-based prosperity will require sustained improvement"},"49":{"dur":4,"text":"in the job market, which in turn requires stronger economic growth."},"55":{"dur":4,"text":"Meanwhile, apart from some temporary fluctuations that largely reflected swings"},"59":{"dur":4,"text":"in energy prices, inflation has remained tame and appears likely to run at"},"63":{"dur":3,"text":"or below the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC's) 2 percent objective"},"67":{"dur":4,"text":"in coming quarters and over the longer term."},"71":{"dur":3,"text":"Against a macroeconomic backdrop that includes both high unemployment"},"74":{"dur":4,"text":"and subdued inflation, the FOMC will maintain its highly accommodative policy."},"80":{"dur":1,"text":"Today the Committee took several steps."},"83":{"dur":2,"text":"First, it decided to continue its purchases"},"85":{"dur":3,"text":"of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), initiated at the September meeting,"},"90":{"dur":2,"text":"at a pace of $40 billion per month."},"93":{"dur":3,"text":"Second, the Committee decided to purchase longer-term Treasury securities,"},"97":{"dur":2,"text":"initially at a pace of $45 billion per month,"},"100":{"dur":2,"text":"after its current program to extend the average maturity"},"103":{"dur":2,"text":"of its holdings is completed at the end of the year."},"106":{"dur":2,"text":"In continuing its asset purchases,"},"108":{"dur":3,"text":"the Committee seeks to maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates"},"112":{"dur":3,"text":"and to keep financial conditions accommodative, thereby promoting hiring"},"116":{"dur":4,"text":"and economic growth while ensuring that inflation over time is close"},"120":{"dur":1,"text":"to our 2 percent objective."},"123":{"dur":4,"text":"Finally, the Committee today also modified its guidance about future rate policy"},"128":{"dur":3,"text":"to provide more information to the public about how it anticipates it will react"},"131":{"dur":1,"text":"to evolving economic conditions."},"134":{"dur":3,"text":"I will return to this change in our communication after discussing our decision"},"137":{"dur":1,"text":"to continue asset purchases."},"139":{"dur":5,"text":"Although the Committee's announcement today specified the initial monthly pace"},"144":{"dur":1,"text":"and composition of asset purchases,"},"146":{"dur":3,"text":"it did not give specific dates at which the program may be modified or ended."},"151":{"dur":2,"text":"Instead, the pattern of future asset purchases will depend"},"154":{"dur":3,"text":"on the Committee's evaluation of incoming information, in two respects."},"159":{"dur":2,"text":"First, we expect to continue asset purchases"},"162":{"dur":3,"text":"until we see a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market,"},"165":{"dur":1,"text":"in a context of price stability."},"168":{"dur":3,"text":"In assessing the extent of progress, the Committee will be evaluating a range"},"172":{"dur":4,"text":"of labor market indicators, including the unemployment rate, payroll employment,"},"176":{"dur":3,"text":"hours worked, and labor force participation, among others."},"181":{"dur":3,"text":"Because increases in demand and production are normally precursors"},"184":{"dur":3,"text":"to improvements in labor market conditions, we will also be looking carefully"},"188":{"dur":2,"text":"at the pace of economic activity more broadly."},"190":{"dur":5,"text":"Second, the Committee will be monitoring economic and financial developments"},"195":{"dur":3,"text":"to assess both the efficacy and possible drawbacks"},"199":{"dur":1,"text":"of its asset purchase program."},"201":{"dur":2,"text":"The Federal Reserve's asset purchases"},"203":{"dur":3,"text":"over the past few years have provided important support to the economy,"},"207":{"dur":3,"text":"for example, by helping to keep mortgage rates historically low."},"210":{"dur":4,"text":"The Committee expects this policy tool to continue to be effective and the costs"},"215":{"dur":3,"text":"and risks to remain manageable, but as the program continues,"},"219":{"dur":2,"text":"we will be regularly updating those assessments."},"222":{"dur":4,"text":"If future evidence suggests that the program's effectiveness has declined,"},"227":{"dur":3,"text":"or if potential unintended side effects or risks become apparent"},"231":{"dur":3,"text":"as the balance sheet grows, we will modify the program as appropriate."},"236":{"dur":3,"text":"More generally, the Committee intends to be flexible in varying the pace"},"239":{"dur":3,"text":"of securities purchases in response to information bearing on the outlook"},"243":{"dur":2,"text":"or on the perceived benefits and costs of the program."},"247":{"dur":4,"text":"Unlike the explicitly quantitative criteria associated"},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"with the Committee's forward guidance about the federal funds rate,"},"254":{"dur":3,"text":"which I will discuss in a moment, the criteria the Committee will use"},"257":{"dur":1,"text":"to make decisions about the pace"},"259":{"dur":4,"text":"and extent of its asset purchase program are qualitative; in particular,"},"264":{"dur":4,"text":"continuation of asset purchases is tied to our seeing substantial improvement"},"268":{"dur":1,"text":"in the outlook for the labor market."},"271":{"dur":4,"text":"Because we expect to learn more over time about the efficacy and potential costs"},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"of asset purchases in the current economic context,"},"278":{"dur":3,"text":"we believe that qualitative guidance is more appropriate at this time."},"282":{"dur":5,"text":"In today's statement, the Committee also recast its forward guidance"},"287":{"dur":3,"text":"to clarify how it expects its target for the federal funds rate to depend"},"291":{"dur":1,"text":"on future economic developments."},"293":{"dur":2,"text":"Specifically, the Committee anticipates that exceptionally low levels"},"296":{"dur":4,"text":"for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted \"at least as long"},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"as the unemployment rate remains above 6\u00bd percent,"},"304":{"dur":3,"text":"inflation over the period between one and two years ahead is projected"},"307":{"dur":1,"text":"to be no more than half a percentage point"},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal,"},"313":{"dur":2,"text":"and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.\""},"317":{"dur":3,"text":"This formulation is a change from earlier statements in which forward guidance"},"320":{"dur":4,"text":"about the federal funds rate was expressed in terms of a date; for example,"},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"in the statements following its September and October meetings,"},"328":{"dur":3,"text":"the Committee indicated that it anticipated that exceptionally low levels"},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted"},"334":{"dur":3,"text":"\"at least through mid-2015.\""},"338":{"dur":3,"text":"The modified formulation makes more explicit the FOMC's intention"},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"to maintain accommodation as long as needed"},"344":{"dur":3,"text":"to promote a stronger economic recovery in the context of price stability,"},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"a strategy that we believe will help support household"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"and business confidence and spending."},"354":{"dur":4,"text":"By tying future monetary policy more explicitly to economic conditions,"},"359":{"dur":4,"text":"this formulation of our policy guidance should also make monetary policy more"},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"transparent and predictable to the public."},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"The change in the form of the Committee's forward guidance does not"},"370":{"dur":3,"text":"in itself imply any change in the Committee's expectations"},"373":{"dur":1,"text":"about the likely future path"},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"of the federal funds rate since the October meeting."},"378":{"dur":2,"text":"In particular, the Committee expects that the stated threshold"},"381":{"dur":2,"text":"for unemployment will not be reached before mid-2015"},"384":{"dur":3,"text":"and projects that inflation will remain close to 2 percent over that period."},"389":{"dur":1,"text":"Thus, given the Committee's current outlook,"},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"the guidance introduced today is consistent"},"393":{"dur":3,"text":"with the Committee's earlier statements that \"exceptionally low levels"},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted"},"399":{"dur":3,"text":"at least through mid-2015.\""},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"Let me emphasize that the 6\u00bd percent threshold"},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"for the unemployment rate should not be interpreted"},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"as the Committee's longer-term objective for unemployment."},"411":{"dur":2,"text":"Indeed, in the economic projections submitted in conjunction"},"414":{"dur":4,"text":"with today's meeting, the central tendency of participants' estimates"},"418":{"dur":5,"text":"of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment is 5.2 to 6.0 percent."},"424":{"dur":3,"text":"However, because changes in monetary policy affect the economy with a lag,"},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"the Committee believes that it likely will need to begin moving away"},"431":{"dur":3,"text":"from a highly accommodative policy stance before the economy reaches"},"435":{"dur":0,"text":"maximum employment."},"437":{"dur":3,"text":"Waiting until maximum employment is achieved before beginning the process"},"441":{"dur":4,"text":"of removing policy accommodation could lead to an undesirable overshooting"},"445":{"dur":4,"text":"of potential output and compromise the FOMC's longer-term inflation objective"},"449":{"dur":0,"text":"of 2 percent."},"451":{"dur":4,"text":"As the FOMC statement makes clear, the Committee anticipates that policy"},"455":{"dur":3,"text":"under the new guidance will be fully consistent with continued progress"},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"against unemployment and with inflation remaining close"},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"to the Committee's 2 percent objective over the longer term."},"466":{"dur":4,"text":"Although the modified guidance should provide greater clarity"},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"about how the Committee expects to respond to incoming data,"},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"it by no means puts monetary policy on autopilot."},"477":{"dur":1,"text":"In this regard, let me make several points."},"479":{"dur":4,"text":"First, as the statement notes, the Committee views its current low-rate policy"},"485":{"dur":4,"text":"as likely to be appropriate at least until the specified thresholds are met."},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"Reaching one of those thresholds, however,"},"492":{"dur":3,"text":"will not automatically trigger immediate reduction in policy accommodation."},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"For example, if unemployment were to decline to slightly below 6\u00bd percent"},"500":{"dur":3,"text":"at a time when inflation and inflation expectations were subdued"},"504":{"dur":4,"text":"and were projected to remain so, the Committee might judge an immediate increase"},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"in its target for the federal funds rate to be inappropriate."},"512":{"dur":3,"text":"Ultimately, in deciding when and how quickly to reduce policy accommodation,"},"517":{"dur":4,"text":"the Committee will follow a balanced approach in seeking to mitigate deviations"},"521":{"dur":4,"text":"of inflation from its longer-run 2 percent goal and deviations of employment"},"525":{"dur":1,"text":"from its estimated maximum level."},"527":{"dur":3,"text":"Second, the Committee recognizes"},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"that no single indicator provides a complete assessment of the state"},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"of the labor market and therefore will consider changes in the unemployment rate"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"within the broader context of labor market conditions."},"541":{"dur":3,"text":"For example, in evaluating a given decline in the unemployment rate,"},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"the Committee will also take into account the extent to which"},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"that decline was associated with increases in employment and hours worked,"},"552":{"dur":3,"text":"as opposed to, say, increases in the number of discouraged workers"},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"and falling labor force participation."},"558":{"dur":1,"text":"The Committee will also consider whether the improvement"},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"in the unemployment rate appears sustainable."},"563":{"dur":4,"text":"Third, the Committee chose to express the inflation threshold in terms"},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"of projected inflation between one and two years ahead,"},"570":{"dur":1,"text":"rather than in terms of current inflation."},"574":{"dur":3,"text":"The Committee took this approach to make clear that it intends to look"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"through purely transitory fluctuations in inflation,"},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"such as those induced by short-term variations in the prices"},"584":{"dur":1,"text":"of internationally traded commodities,"},"586":{"dur":3,"text":"and to focus instead on the underlying inflation trend."},"590":{"dur":4,"text":"In making its collective judgment about the underlying inflation trend,"},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"the Committee will consider a variety of indicators,"},"598":{"dur":3,"text":"including measures such as median, trimmed mean, and core inflation;"},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"the views of outside forecasters; and the predictions of econometric"},"606":{"dur":1,"text":"and statistical models of inflation."},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"Also, the Committee will pay close attention to measures"},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"of inflation expectations to ensure"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"that those expectations remain well anchored."},"617":{"dur":3,"text":"Finally, the Committee will continue to monitor a wide range of information"},"620":{"dur":4,"text":"on economic and financial developments to ensure that policy is conducted"},"625":{"dur":1,"text":"in a manner consistent with our dual mandate."},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"It's worth noting that the goals of the FOMC's asset purchases"},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"and of its federal funds rate guidance are somewhat different."},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"The goal of the asset purchase program is to increase the near-term momentum"},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"of the economy by fostering more-accommodative financial conditions,"},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"while the purpose of the rate guidance is to provide information"},"646":{"dur":1,"text":"about the future circumstances"},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"under which the Committee would contemplate reducing accommodation."},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"I would emphasize that a decision by the Committee to end asset purchases,"},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"whenever that point is reached, would not be a turn to tighter policy."},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"While in that circumstance the Committee would no longer be increasing policy"},"663":{"dur":4,"text":"accommodation, its policy stance would remain highly supportive of growth."},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"Only at some later point would the Committee begin actually removing"},"671":{"dur":1,"text":"accommodation through rate increases."},"674":{"dur":1,"text":"Moreover, as I have discussed today,"},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"the decisions to modify the asset purchase program"},"678":{"dur":3,"text":"and to undertake rate increases are tied to different criteria."},"682":{"dur":6,"text":"In conclusion, the FOMC's actions today are part of our ongoing efforts"},"688":{"dur":4,"text":"to support economic recovery and job creation while maintaining price stability."},"693":{"dur":4,"text":"As I have often stressed, however, monetary policy has its limits;"},"698":{"dur":4,"text":"only the private and public sectors working together can get the U.S. economy"},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"fully back on track."},"704":{"dur":4,"text":"In particular, it will be critical that fiscal policymakers come together soon"},"709":{"dur":4,"text":"to achieve longer-term fiscal sustainability without adopting policies"},"714":{"dur":1,"text":"that could derail the ongoing recovery."},"716":{"dur":0,"text":"Thank you."},"717":{"dur":1,"text":"I would be happy to answer your questions."},"719":{"dur":0,"text":"STEVE LIESMAN."},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"Mr. Chairman, Steve Liesman from CNBC."},"724":{"dur":6,"text":"I guess I have a lot of questions but I'll just offer up two here."},"730":{"dur":5,"text":"Why are there different targets for QE and for the funds rate?"},"736":{"dur":1,"text":"What does that achieve?"},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"Secondly, what good is a target if you have to make reference to calendar dates"},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"in the statement itself, which is the thing you got away from."},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"You had to point out in the statement that it's not substantially different"},"747":{"dur":1,"text":"from the calendar dates we set back in October."},"748":{"dur":1,"text":"Do you have to keep doing that from now"},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"on to make it clear that-and then just thirdly,"},"752":{"dur":1,"text":"I guess I know I said two- CHAIRMAN BERNANKE."},"754":{"dur":0,"text":"I'm going to forget."},"755":{"dur":3,"text":"But then you have another paragraph after that"},"758":{"dur":1,"text":"that says it's not just target it's something else."},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"So, it's unclear to me what good these targets are if you have"},"763":{"dur":0,"text":"to reference a calendar date,"},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"and then you kind of say in the next paragraph it's not really targets."},"767":{"dur":1,"text":"CHAIRMAN BERNANKE."},"768":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, so first, the-as I said-the asset purchases"},"773":{"dur":4,"text":"and the rate increases have different objectives."},"777":{"dur":3,"text":"The asset purchases are about creating some near-term momentum in the economy,"},"781":{"dur":3,"text":"trying to strengthen growth and job creation in the near term,"},"785":{"dur":5,"text":"and the increases in the federal funds rate target, when they ultimately occur,"},"791":{"dur":2,"text":"are about reducing accommodation."},"793":{"dur":1,"text":"Two very different objectives."},"795":{"dur":8,"text":"Secondly, the asset purchases are a less well understood tool."},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"We have-we'll be learning over time about how efficacious they are,"},"809":{"dur":5,"text":"about what costs they may carry with them in terms of unintended consequences"},"814":{"dur":4,"text":"that they might create, and we'll be seeing how-what else happens in the economy"},"819":{"dur":3,"text":"that can affect, you know, the level of unemployment,"},"823":{"dur":1,"text":"for example, that we hope to achieve."},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, for that reason, as I discussed in my opening remarks,"},"828":{"dur":7,"text":"we decided to make the criteria for asset purchases qualitative at this time"},"836":{"dur":1,"text":"because we have a number of different things that we need"},"838":{"dur":2,"text":"to look at as we go forward."},"840":{"dur":3,"text":"Rate increases, by contrast, are well understood,"},"844":{"dur":5,"text":"and we understand the relationship between those rate increases"},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"and the state of the economy."},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we've been able to give somewhat more quantitative,"},"854":{"dur":1,"text":"more specific guidance in that respect."},"856":{"dur":4,"text":"With respect to the date, in the transition today,"},"861":{"dur":4,"text":"we wanted to make clear that the change in guidance did not-it happens"},"866":{"dur":3,"text":"to be the case that it doesn't change our mid-2015 expectation."},"870":{"dur":7,"text":"Going forward, we'll drop the date and rely on the conditionality, and that has,"},"878":{"dur":3,"text":"I think, a very important advantage which is that if news comes"},"881":{"dur":6,"text":"in that the economy is stronger or weaker, then financial markets"},"887":{"dur":3,"text":"and the public will be able to adjust their expectations"},"891":{"dur":4,"text":"for when policy tightening will occur without the Committee having to go"},"896":{"dur":3,"text":"through a process of changing its date in a nontransparent way,"},"900":{"dur":3,"text":"so I think that's beneficial."},"904":{"dur":9,"text":"Does that cover your-okay."},"915":{"dur":0,"text":"MARCY GORDON."},"916":{"dur":3,"text":"Mr. Chairman, what prompted the Committee to make the decision"},"919":{"dur":3,"text":"at this particular time to specify targets?"},"923":{"dur":6,"text":"And, by taking an unemployment rate that is quite low compared to currently,"},"930":{"dur":5,"text":"does that shift the balance of priorities in terms of your dual mandate,"},"936":{"dur":5,"text":"closer more in the direction of reducing unemployment rather"},"942":{"dur":2,"text":"than inflationary pressures?"},"946":{"dur":1,"text":"That's a very good question."},"948":{"dur":4,"text":"We took the change today after a good bit of discussion."},"952":{"dur":1,"text":"We had a very substantial discussion"},"954":{"dur":2,"text":"of the threshold approach at our last meeting."},"957":{"dur":5,"text":"And we felt it was ready to go, ready to put out."},"963":{"dur":4,"text":"We-while there are different views on aspects of the threshold approach,"},"968":{"dur":4,"text":"there was a lot of agreement that having a more explicit connection"},"973":{"dur":4,"text":"between rate policy and the state of the economy was more transparent"},"978":{"dur":4,"text":"and more helpful to the markets and to the public than our date-based guidance,"},"982":{"dur":4,"text":"and therefore, there was a general view that, at some point at least,"},"987":{"dur":3,"text":"that we should switch to that kind of guidance."},"991":{"dur":3,"text":"So we do hope that it'll be more helpful and give markets more information"},"995":{"dur":2,"text":"about how we're going to respond going forward."},"998":{"dur":7,"text":"It is not a change in our relative balance, weights, towards inflation"},"1005":{"dur":1,"text":"and unemployment-by no means."},"1008":{"dur":1,"text":"First of all, with respect to inflation,"},"1009":{"dur":3,"text":"we remain completely committed to our 2 percent longer-run objective."},"1013":{"dur":4,"text":"Moreover, we expect our forecast, as you can see from the Summary"},"1017":{"dur":4,"text":"of Economic Projections; our forecasts are that inflation will actually remain,"},"1022":{"dur":6,"text":"despite this threshold of 2\u00bd, that inflation will actually remain at"},"1028":{"dur":2,"text":"or below 2 percent going forward."},"1032":{"dur":6,"text":"And so-and finally, the thresholds that we have put out are entirely consistent"},"1039":{"dur":3,"text":"with our long-standing views on what the rate path has to be,"},"1043":{"dur":4,"text":"what the path of interest rates has to be, in order to achieve improvement"},"1048":{"dur":2,"text":"in the labor market while keeping inflation close to target."},"1051":{"dur":3,"text":"So we-I think both sides of the mandate are well-served here."},"1054":{"dur":1,"text":"There is no real change in policy."},"1056":{"dur":5,"text":"What it is instead is an attempt to clarify the relationship"},"1062":{"dur":2,"text":"between policy and economic conditions."},"1064":{"dur":1,"text":"MARCY GORDON."},"1066":{"dur":6,"text":"Could I ask, also, given that the-your economic projections are all the more"},"1072":{"dur":4,"text":"important now that you've specified these targets,"},"1077":{"dur":5,"text":"is it difficult to put forward these projections now given the uncertainty"},"1082":{"dur":2,"text":"over the fiscal cliff?"},"1085":{"dur":2,"text":"How sort of plastic are these?"},"1089":{"dur":1,"text":"Are you talking about the SEP projections?"},"1091":{"dur":1,"text":"MARCY GORDON."},"1093":{"dur":0,"text":"Yes. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE."},"1094":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, clearly the fiscal cliff is having effects on the economy."},"1099":{"dur":1,"text":"Even though we've not yet even reached the point"},"1102":{"dur":3,"text":"of the fiscal cliff potentially kicking in,"},"1106":{"dur":3,"text":"it's already affecting business investment and hiring decisions"},"1109":{"dur":2,"text":"by creating uncertainty or creating pessimism."},"1112":{"dur":4,"text":"We saw what happened recently to consumer sentiment, which fell,"},"1117":{"dur":2,"text":"presumably in part because of concerns about the fiscal cliff."},"1120":{"dur":5,"text":"So, clearly, this is a major risk factor and a major source of uncertainty"},"1126":{"dur":1,"text":"about the economy going forward."},"1129":{"dur":6,"text":"I would suspect and, although the participants don't all make this explicit,"},"1135":{"dur":3,"text":"but I would suspect that what they are assuming in their projections is"},"1139":{"dur":3,"text":"that the fiscal cliff gets resolved in some intermediate way,"},"1143":{"dur":3,"text":"whereby there is still some fiscal drag but not as much as implied"},"1147":{"dur":2,"text":"by the entire fiscal cliff."},"1149":{"dur":4,"text":"So I think that's probably the underlying assumption that most people took"},"1153":{"dur":1,"text":"when they made their projections."},"1156":{"dur":3,"text":"But as you-you're absolutely right that there is a lot of uncertainty right now"},"1159":{"dur":4,"text":"and if the fiscal cliff situation turns out to be resolved"},"1164":{"dur":1,"text":"in a way very different from our expectations,"},"1166":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm sure you would see changes in the forecast."},"1170":{"dur":4,"text":"ALISTER BULL."},"1175":{"dur":1,"text":"Alister Bull from Reuters."},"1176":{"dur":1,"text":"Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman."},"1178":{"dur":5,"text":"Could you talk about whether the decision to maintain the monthly bond purchases"},"1184":{"dur":4,"text":"at 85 billion a month represents a ramping up or additional easing"},"1188":{"dur":3,"text":"to Fed policy, because you're now going to be adding a little bit more"},"1191":{"dur":1,"text":"to the size of balance sheet?"},"1193":{"dur":6,"text":"And also, you know, you've talked about maintaining the asset purchases"},"1200":{"dur":2,"text":"until you see a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market,"},"1203":{"dur":2,"text":"and you've said that you want to take a qualitative approach,"},"1206":{"dur":5,"text":"but you've also got this 6\u00bd percent inflation threshold out there as well."},"1211":{"dur":2,"text":"So, could you talk about what sort of evidence you'd see to sort"},"1214":{"dur":3,"text":"of make you change the pace or slow the pace of purchases?"},"1217":{"dur":0,"text":"CHAIRMAN BERNANKE."},"1218":{"dur":1,"text":"The first part of your question was?"},"1221":{"dur":3,"text":"Is this an additional stimulus or are you- CHAIRMAN BERNANKE."},"1225":{"dur":3,"text":"No, I think this is really a continuation of what we said in September."},"1228":{"dur":4,"text":"You recall in September we expressed dissatisfaction"},"1233":{"dur":1,"text":"with progress in the labor market."},"1235":{"dur":3,"text":"We, at that point, we began the $40 billion per month of MBS purchases"},"1239":{"dur":4,"text":"and we said that unless we saw substantial improvement in the outlook"},"1244":{"dur":3,"text":"for the labor market that we would undertake additional asset purchases"},"1247":{"dur":1,"text":"or other actions."},"1249":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's what we've done today is simply follow"},"1252":{"dur":2,"text":"through on

cost on policy that doesn't exist"},"2626":{"dur":1,"text":"when you're dealing only with the federal funds rate."},"2628":{"dur":5,"text":"And so what we're trying to do here is balance the potential benefits,"},"2634":{"dur":3,"text":"in terms of lower unemployment and inflation at target,"},"2638":{"dur":6,"text":"against the reality that as the balance sheet gets

purchases"},"2697":{"dur":3,"text":"and their forecasts are included in there as well."},"2701":{"dur":3,"text":"So, it's not exactly an apples to apples comparison,"},"2705":{"dur":4,"text":"but it is true that if we could wave a magic wand and get unemployment"},"2710":{"dur":2,"text":"down to 5 percent tomorrow, obviously we would do that,"},"2713":{"dur":5,"text":"but there are constraints in

account for at least part of the somewhat slower growth."},"2948":{"dur":2,"text":"At the same time, though, what-of course,"},"2951":{"dur":4,"text":"what monetary policy influences is not potential

run."},"3097":{"dur":1,"text":"I'd add a caveat to this."},"3098":{"dur":5,"text":"There's a little bit of a caveat here, which is that very extended periods"},"3104":{"dur":4,"text":"of unemployment can interfere with the workings of the labor market."},"3109":{"dur":5,"text":"And so, if the Fed were not to address a large unemployment problem"},"3115":{"dur":1,"text":"for a long time, it might, in fact,"},"3116":{"dur":2,"text":"have some influence on the long term unemployment rate."},"3119":{"dur":2,"text":"But as a general rule, as a general rule,"},"3121":{"dur":1,"text":"and I think this is the right baseline,"},"3123":{"dur":7,"text":"the long-term unemployment rate is determined by a range of structural features"},"3131":{"dur":4,"text":"of the economy and a range of economic policies and not by monetary policy."},"3136":{"dur":8,"text":"So that being said, what our 6\u00bd percent threshold is is-as I said"},"3145":{"dur":5,"text":"in my opening remarks, it is not a target-what it is is a guidepost in terms"},"3151":{"dur":9,"text":"of when the beginning of the reduction of accommodation could begin."},"3160":{"dur":1,"text":"It could be later than that,"},"3162":{"dur":5,"text":"but at least by that time, no earlier than that time."},"3168":{"dur":5,"text":"So it's really more like a reaction function or a Taylor rule, if you will."},"3173":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't want-I'm-I'll get-I'm ready to get the phone call from John Taylor."},"3177":{"dur":4,"text":"It is not a Taylor rule but it has the same feature that it

evolve"},"3192":{"dur":1,"text":"over time as the economy evolves."},"3194":{"dur":4,"text":"It has no implication that we can affect the long-run unemployment rate,"},"3198":{"dur":2,"text":"which we

information"},"3221":{"dur":5,"text":"on unemployment and inflation gives more information to the markets,"},"3227":{"dur":6,"text":"to the public that allows them to infer how our policy is likely to evolve."},"3234":{"dur":4,"text":"[Speaker unknown; inaudible remark] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE."},"3239":{"dur":4,"text":"Unless-so long as the inflation condition is met."},"3244":{"dur":0,"text":"It's

our policy in the future."},"3286":{"dur":4,"text":"The date-based guidance, it served a purpose."},"3290":{"dur":4,"text":"But it had the problem that whenever economic outlook changed,"},"3295":{"dur":2,"text":"the Committee was faced with the question"},"3298":{"dur":1,"text":"of whether we should change the date-based guidance,"},"3299":{"dur":2,"text":"and we did change it a couple of times."},"3302":{"dur":2,"text":"But that was a nontransparent process."},"3304":{"dur":4,"text":"Nobody understood exactly why we made a particular change"},"3309":{"dur":2,"text":"because we were not providing any kind of fundamental information"},"3311":{"dur":2,"text":"about how our policy is linked to the underlying outlook."},"3314":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, we, I believe, certainly, that this approach is superior."},"3319":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not saying it's the best possible approach,"},"3321":{"dur":1,"text":"there may be other things we can do in the future."},"3323":{"dur":2,"text":"We're always looking to find ways to improve our communication"},"3326":{"dur":5,"text":"but I do think it's more transparent and will allow the markets"},"3331":{"dur":4,"text":"to respond quickly and promptly to changes in the outlook by adjusting"},"3336":{"dur":4,"text":"when they think rate increases will begin, and therefore, it'll act,"},"3340":{"dur":1,"text":"to some extent, like an automatic stabilizer."},"3341":{"dur":5,"text":"So if the outlook worsens and that leads markets to think that the increase"},"3347":{"dur":4,"text":"in rates is further out in the future, that will tend to lower longer term rates"},"3352":{"dur":2,"text":"and that would tend to be supportive of the economy."},"3354":{"dur":2,"text":"So that has an automatic stabilizer type effect."},"3356":{"dur":2,"text":"It kind of offsets adverse shocks."},"3358":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's a better form of communication."},"3360":{"dur":2,"text":"As I said, we discussed it quite extensively at the last meeting."},"3364":{"dur":9,"text":"And so-and frankly, given that it's a relatively complex change,"},"3373":{"dur":2,"text":"it seemed like it would be a good idea to do it at a meeting"},"3376":{"dur":1,"text":"where there was a press conference."},"3378":{"dur":7,"text":"So, we decided since we're ready to go why not make the change earlier"},"3385":{"dur":1,"text":"and get the benefit earlier."},"3386":{"dur":0,"text":"WYATT ANDREWS."},"3387":{"dur":3,"text":"As a quick follow up, are you-did you see a level of uncertainty"},"3390":{"dur":3,"text":"in the business community that you hope to solve by this announcement?"},"3394":{"dur":1,"text":"CHAIRMAN BERNANKE."},"3395":{"dur":7,"text":"Well, at the moment, I think that the expectations of the business community"},"3402":{"dur":6,"text":"and of the Federal Open Market Committee happen to be pretty well aligned."},"3409":{"dur":3,"text":"If you look at the financial market indicators,"},"3412":{"dur":2,"text":"the future federal funds rate path,"},"3415":{"dur":4,"text":"it's pretty consistent with the mid-2015 date-based guidance"},"3419":{"dur":0,"text":"that we had been providing."},"3420":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm not saying there was a major inconsistency"},"3422":{"dur":3,"text":"between what the business community was expecting, the markets were expecting,"},"3426":{"dur":1,"text":"and what we were expecting."},"3428":{"dur":1,"text":"So that wasn't really the issue."},"3429":{"dur":3,"text":"The problem is that, looking forward,"},"3432":{"dur":4,"text":"that what happens if there is a significant change either for the better,"},"3437":{"dur":2,"text":"or for the worse, in the outlook?"},"3440":{"dur":4,"text":"Under the date-based guidance, that would require the Committee to determine,"},"3444":{"dur":4,"text":"you know, what the new date is and to make that change in a nontransparent way."},"3449":{"dur":3,"text":"But under this threshold-based guidance,"},"3453":{"dur":4,"text":"the markets and the business community can make that calculation on their own"},"3458":{"dur":8,"text":"and adjust that-their estimates of when rates will begin to increase based only"},"3466":{"dur":2,"text":"on their own forecast and not have to

empirical and theoretical analysis-and we've had quite a bit of work done"},"4446":{"dur":5,"text":"on this issue-suggests that over time, the great majority of the decline"},"4451":{"dur":4,"text":"in MBS yields does get passed through to mortgage rates."},"4457":{"dur":6,"text":"So we do anticipate, over time, that the full benefit will,"},"4464":{"dur":3,"text":"or most of the benefit will, be seen by retail customers."},"4468":{"dur":2,"text":"And indeed, we have seen already a pretty significant decline"},"4471":{"dur":2,"text":"since September in retail mortgage rates."},"4474":{"dur":5,"text":"But one thing that's perhaps confusing this issue a little bit is"},"4480":{"dur":2,"text":"that there are other things happening in the economy"},"4482":{"dur":2,"text":"which are affecting those spreads."},"4484":{"dur":8,"text":"So, for example, there are capacity limitations, which are

example."},"4501":{"dur":1,"text":"There's higher g-fees."},"4502":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's a number of things happening in the economy which will tend,"},"4506":{"dur":4,"text":"all else equal, to raise that spread between mortgage rates"},"4510":{"dur":2,"text":"and MBS yields, so that's unfortunate."},"4514":{"dur":5,"text":"What we can try to do there, of course, is to try to encourage good policy,"},"4519":{"dur":3,"text":"for example, on putbacks, that will reduce the perceived risk"},"4523":{"dur":3,"text":"and cost to the banks of making mortgage loans."},"4528":{"dur":6,"text":"But

constant,"},"4540":{"dur":3,"text":"it does seem to be the case that, over a period of time, not immediately,"},"4544":{"dur":4,"text":"but over a period of time, most of the declines in MBS yields do
