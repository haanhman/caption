now,"},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's doing\nbetter, thank god."},"298":{"dur":4,"text":"But yes, we took a stab\nat the online market."},"302":{"dur":1,"text":"Because my customers\nwere like, hey,"},"304":{"dur":1,"text":"why don't you try\nselling this online?"},"305":{"dur":1,"text":"And I was like, all\nright, I'll try."},"307":{"dur":3,"text":"And I sold the bag\nvia Google

the best coffee I ever had."},"333":{"dur":2,"text":"And from there,\nthat review led up"},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"to another sale\nand another sale."},"337":{"dur":3,"text":"So I was selling basically\none pound a week,"},"340":{"dur":2,"text":"and then two pounds a week,\nand then three pounds a week."},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"And all of a sudden, it just\nsnowballed into this

Yeah, you'd think\nI would say yes immediately."},"368":{"dur":0,"text":"But I don't know."},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"There was that--"},"371":{"dur":4,"text":"For me, it was a brave step,\nbecause I

there,\norders took off."},"412":{"dur":4,"text":"I didn't have enough coffee,\nenough bags, enough people."},"416":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's how I\nbasically hired

to fulfill."},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"Where am I going to find\npeople to help me do this?"},"426":{"dur":3,"text":"So I went to my customers\nin my coffee shop,"},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"and I

a Keurig brand."},"737":{"dur":1,"text":"I think it was the OXX BOXX."},"739":{"dur":3,"text":"And it was just the top\nrated brewer at the time,"},"743":{"dur":0,"text":"and we sent that to
