right?"},"3073":{"dur":0,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: And wolves don't."},"3074":{"dur":0,"text":"CARL SAFINA: That's baloney."},"3075":{"dur":1,"text":"CARL SAFINA: And here's\nwhy it's

sit."},"3098":{"dur":1,"text":"OK, ready, go."},"3100":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, point."},"3102":{"dur":2,"text":"OK, so the owner points."},"3104":{"dur":1,"text":"The dog looks."},"3105":{"dur":2,"text":"Then they take\nwolves with humans"},"3108":{"dur":1,"text":"that they don't know it all."},"3109":{"dur":2,"text":"They put them behind a chain\nlink fence because, oh, my god,"},"3112":{"dur":1,"text":"they're wolves."},"3113":{"dur":0,"text":"And they point."},"3114":{"dur":2,"text":"And a wolf behind a chain link\nfence surrounded by

that\ncommunication work?"},"3165":{"dur":2,"text":"Do we know about\nhow they coordinate"},"3167":{"dur":2,"text":"those kind of things?"},"3170":{"dur":2,"text":"CARL SAFINA: In\nsome cases, we

The lions, right."},"3190":{"dur":2,"text":"So I actually saw some of\nthe thing with the lions."},"3193":{"dur":6,"text":"And I didn't see the behavior\ndevelop because they knew"},"3199":{"dur":1,"text":"exactly what they were doing."},"3201":{"dur":1,"text":"But I saw them do it."},"3202":{"dur":4,"text":"So what I saw was\nlions are sleeping."},"3206":{"dur":1,"text":"We're watching these lions."},"3207":{"dur":1,"text":"We were watching\nthose particular lions"},"3209":{"dur":2,"text":"because that particular\npride had a habit of hunting"},"3212":{"dur":1,"text":"during daylight,\nwhich is unusual."},"3213":{"dur":2,"text":"So we went to watch and\nsee if they were going"},"3216":{"dur":1,"text":"to do something really cool."},"3217":{"dur":2,"text":"And they were sleeping,\nand then they woke up."},"3219":{"dur":1,"text":"And when they woke\nup, they got up"},"3221":{"dur":3,"text":"and they did a big rally

everything."},"3230":{"dur":1,"text":"And then they're\ngoing to go hunt."},"3232":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, first of all, you don't\nneed to lick somebody's face"},"3236":{"dur":1,"text":"in order to go hunting, right?"},"3238":{"dur":1,"text":"But they do that."},"3239":{"dur":0,"text":"Why do they do that?"},"3240":{"dur":2,"text":"Because that's a reaffirmation."},"3242":{"dur":2,"text":"It's just like we wake up\nand we say good morning"},"3244":{"dur":1,"text":"to everybody in our family."},"3246":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a reaffirmation."},"3248":{"dur":1,"text":"We know who we are."},"3250":{"dur":0,"text":"We're together."},"3251":{"dur":1,"text":"This is our group identity."},"3252":{"dur":5,"text":"So that thing, reestablished\nin the course of their day,"},"3258":{"dur":2,"text":"they then leave the\narea where they were all"},"3261":{"dur":1,"text":"lying around sleeping."},"3262":{"dur":2,"text":"And they leave together,\nbecause that greeting"},"3264":{"dur":1,"text":"helped coordinate them."},"3266":{"dur":1,"text":"OK, we're all up now?"},"3267":{"dur":2,"text":"OK, let's go."},"3269":{"dur":1,"text":"They go to a hill."},"3271":{"dur":1,"text":"Obviously, they know\nexactly what hill"},"3273":{"dur":2,"text":"they're going to because\nthey just went there."},"3275":{"dur":1,"text":"They just go to the hill."},"3277":{"dur":5,"text":"And then they walk along\nthe crest of the hill."},"3282":{"dur":2,"text":"One of them sits down,\nand the others keep going."},"3284":{"dur":2,"text":"And why did that lion just sit\ndown and the other keep going?"},"3287":{"dur":3,"text":"A second lion sits down,\nand the rest keep going."},"3290":{"dur":1,"text":"A third lion sits."},"3292":{"dur":3,"text":"A fourth lion sits,\nuntil there is a picket"},"3295":{"dur":2,"text":"fence of yellow lions\nin the yellow grass"},"3297":{"dur":1,"text":"at the crest of this hill."},"3298":{"dur":4,"text":"And one lion walks\ntoward the zebras that"},"3303":{"dur":2,"text":"are about a quarter mile away."},"3305":{"dur":4,"text":"And the plan is-- which\nthey've obviously done before"},"3310":{"dur":1,"text":"and they knew exactly\nwhat they were"},"3311":{"dur":2,"text":"doing-- we'll all wait here."},"3314":{"dur":2,"text":"You go chase the\nzebras up the hill."},"3317":{"dur":1,"text":"The zebras were no fools."},"3318":{"dur":2,"text":"They detected the\nlion that was coming,"},"3321":{"dur":2,"text":"and they spooked and\nwent farther away."},"3324":{"dur":1,"text":"So what I saw was really,\nreally interesting,"},"3326":{"dur":3,"text":"It wasn't incredibly dramatic\nbecause the hunt really"},"3329":{"dur":1,"text":"didn't engage."},"3331":{"dur":3,"text":"As far as the killer\nwhales, they fan out,"},"3335":{"dur":2,"text":"and they're looking in the\npack ice, those ones that"},"3337":{"dur":1,"text":"wash the seals off."},"3338":{"dur":2,"text":"They fan out, and they're\nlooking around the pack ice."},"3340":{"dur":3,"text":"They can hear each other a\nlong distance underwater,"},"3343":{"dur":2,"text":"and they call a lot."},"3346":{"dur":2,"text":"They recognize each\nother's voices,"},"3348":{"dur":1,"text":"like you recognize\npeople on the telephone."},"3350":{"dur":1,"text":"They know who's\ncalling underwater."},"3352":{"dur":2,"text":"And they're looking\nmostly for Weddell seals."},"3355":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a certain kind of seal\nthat they particularly like."},"3358":{"dur":2,"text":"So if they're not\nfood stressed, they're"},"3360":{"dur":2,"text":"looking for Weddell seals."},"3362":{"dur":2,"text":"One of them finds\na Weddell seal."},"3365":{"dur":2,"text":"It doesn't immediately try\nto attack the Weddell seal."},"3368":{"dur":5,"text":"It backs off and calls until\nthe rest of the group which"},"3374":{"dur":2,"text":"might, in that case, be\nthree or four individuals,"},"3376":{"dur":1,"text":"they all come together."},"3377":{"dur":2,"text":"They swim away from the ice."},"3380":{"dur":5,"text":"And then on some signal, either\nvocal or visual behavioral,"},"3386":{"dur":2,"text":"it's OK, now, and\nthen they all go."},"3388":{"dur":3,"text":"And they all pump their\ntails like this in unison,"},"3392":{"dur":4,"text":"and that creates a big moving\nwave right above the tails."},"3396":{"dur":2,"text":"And they go right\nto the ice, and then"},"3398":{"dur":1,"text":"they just dive under the ice."},"3399":{"dur":1,"text":"That wave breaks over the ice."},"3401":{"dur":3,"text":"It washes the seal off, and\nthen they get the seal that way."},"3405":{"dur":4,"text":"And killer whales, more than\nany other animal in the world,"},"3409":{"dur":1,"text":"they share their kills."},"3410":{"dur":2,"text":"They share a really high\npercentage of their kills."},"3413":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's a really, really\ncooperative hunting thing."},"3417":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, wolves share the kills\ntoo but in a more passive way."},"3420":{"dur":2,"text":"The thing is down,\nand it's just there,"},"3422":{"dur":1,"text":"and they all eat from it."},"3424":{"dur":4,"text":"But the whales actually pull\nit apart and bring pieces"},"3428":{"dur":2,"text":"and give to one another."},"3430":{"dur":2,"text":"Because they're in a more\nfluid environment like that."},"3433":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm happy to stay\na few more minutes."},"3435":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't want to keep\nyou too much longer,"},"3437":{"dur":2,"text":"because we did start late."},"3439":{"dur":2,"text":"And I want to thank you very,\nvery much for coming out."},"3441":{"dur":0,"text":"Obviously, we've got\nsome books in the back."},"3442":{"dur":0,"text":"Thank you."},"3443":{"dur":3,"text":"[APPLAUSE]"}}
