{"1":{"dur":2,"text":"All right, so\nmy name is Gareth Jones."},"4":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'm an API Architect\nfrom the Microsoft Graph."},"5":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm gonna spend the next hour or so"},"7":{"dur":2,"text":"talking to you about how you can\nmake awesome line of business"},"10":{"dur":1,"text":"applications with\nthe Microsoft Graph."},"15":{"dur":2,"text":"So what are we gonna talk\nabout in this session?"},"17":{"dur":1,"text":"So we're gonna do a quick\noverview of the Microsoft Graph."},"21":{"dur":3,"text":"And look at what's new and\nwhat's available at the moment, and"},"24":{"dur":1,"text":"what things we're announcing\nthis week here at Ignite."},"26":{"dur":1,"text":"We've got some great new stuff for\nyou."},"27":{"dur":3,"text":"And then we're gonna spend\nthe majority of the time"},"30":{"dur":2,"text":"looking at the graph from the point\nof view of building line of"},"33":{"dur":2,"text":"business applications and\ndive into some great code and demos."},"41":{"dur":3,"text":"So what is the Microsoft Graph?"},"44":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, if any of you went to the\nsession yesterday with Robin Tristan"},"47":{"dur":2,"text":"or have caught some of our\nother Office platform material,"},"49":{"dur":2,"text":"you would have seen this kind\nof taxonomy of where things fit"},"52":{"dur":1,"text":"together in the Office platform."},"56":{"dur":1,"text":"And the Microsoft Graph,"},"57":{"dur":3,"text":"really we tend to pitch in this\ncloud piece in the middle here."},"60":{"dur":2,"text":"Sitting squarely there and"},"62":{"dur":2,"text":"building smarter apps by\nconnecting to Office services."},"65":{"dur":2,"text":"But really, to be honest,\nit's more pervasive than that."},"68":{"dur":1,"text":"If you think about building\nan add-in for Office and"},"69":{"dur":3,"text":"you've got somebody sitting\nthere in the UI of Office,"},"73":{"dur":2,"text":"your probably gonna be talking\nto some backend services and"},"75":{"dur":3,"text":"quite likely talking to those\nthrough the Microsoft Graph as well."},"78":{"dur":2,"text":"Or if you're building some\nconversational application,"},"81":{"dur":2,"text":"it's entirely likely that\nyou're gonna be talking to some"},"84":{"dur":1,"text":"Microsoft Graph\nservices through that."},"86":{"dur":4,"text":"So really, increasingly, we find\nthe Microsoft Graph as appearing"},"90":{"dur":3,"text":"all across the surface\nof our Office platform."},"93":{"dur":3,"text":"And more broadly than just Office,\nacross our entire Microsoft"},"96":{"dur":2,"text":"developer stack as we grow\nthe surface of the Microsoft Graph."},"101":{"dur":2,"text":"So what actually is\nthe Microsoft Graph?"},"104":{"dur":3,"text":"So who here has, before this week,\nheard of the Microsoft Graph?"},"109":{"dur":1,"text":"My, most of you, okay."},"110":{"dur":3,"text":"And who had actually written some\ncode against the Microsoft Graph?"},"114":{"dur":4,"text":"Yeah, it's maybe about 15%, 20%."},"118":{"dur":3,"text":"All right, so\nit's a good leveling for me."},"122":{"dur":3,"text":"So the cool thing about the\nMicrosoft Graph really is that we're"},"126":{"dur":3,"text":"drawing all of the APIs from\nMicrosoft's cloud services into"},"129":{"dur":0,"text":"a single API."},"130":{"dur":2,"text":"And you will see from this\nnice pretty diagram here, that"},"133":{"dur":3,"text":"our focus up until now has been on\nthe productivity cloud services for"},"137":{"dur":2,"text":"Microsoft, things like\npieces of Office."},"140":{"dur":2,"text":"And we're gradually starting\nto expand that, and"},"142":{"dur":3,"text":"you'll see some of that later in my\ntalk as we broaden this out to span"},"145":{"dur":2,"text":"more of Microsoft's Cloud Services."},"148":{"dur":3,"text":"But that single API, obviously,\nwe think about an API for"},"151":{"dur":3,"text":"accessing data whether\nthat's accessing my data,"},"154":{"dur":3,"text":"my profile, grabbing some\ngroups out of exchange or"},"157":{"dur":3,"text":"Active Directory, or grabbing\nsome email with some messages."},"161":{"dur":2,"text":"But that would just really\nbe the Microsoft API,"},"163":{"dur":3,"text":"right, not the Microsoft Graph,\njust grabbing the data."},"167":{"dur":4,"text":"So really the thing which links it\ntogether and turns it into a graph"},"171":{"dur":4,"text":"is the fact that you can traverse\nthese links between the data."},"175":{"dur":1,"text":"So I can go and hop across here."},"177":{"dur":3,"text":"So for example, I've got a fraction\nof a URL, where I'm hopping from one"},"180":{"dur":3,"text":"drive, you see I'm going, and\nsay I'm getting a drive item."},"186":{"dur":4,"text":"And then I'm diving across into\nActive Directory and saying hey,"},"190":{"dur":3,"text":"get me some information about the\nuser who last modified that file."},"193":{"dur":2,"text":"So I am joining across there and\nmaking a true graph."},"196":{"dur":4,"text":"And then the third thing about\nthe graph is that we're allowing you"},"201":{"dur":1,"text":"go and get reach data, so"},"202":{"dur":3,"text":"we're running a lot of machine\nlearning at Microsoft now."},"206":{"dur":2,"text":"And trying to give you that\ninformation that we find about your"},"209":{"dur":3,"text":"data back to you so you can make\nyour own applications more rich or"},"212":{"dur":1,"text":"so our applications\nthat we build for"},"214":{"dur":4,"text":"you as part of source offerings\nare much richer for your end users."},"218":{"dur":2,"text":"So we might go and rather than you\njust having to access a specific"},"221":{"dur":3,"text":"document, you might go and find all\nof the documents that are trending"},"224":{"dur":3,"text":"around the users that you work with\nto get a feed of those documents."},"227":{"dur":5,"text":"And then finally, we bring all of\nthat together under an umbrella."},"232":{"dur":3,"text":"Whether you're working with work and\nschool users or"},"236":{"dur":4,"text":"personal users under that same\nsingle URI, the Microsoft Graph."},"241":{"dur":3,"text":"Graph.microsoft.com."},"244":{"dur":3,"text":"So before we had the Microsoft\nGraph, what did things look like?"},"248":{"dur":2,"text":"Is this really so revolutionary\nto have this single API?"},"251":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, we obviously had a bunch\nof these cloud services."},"255":{"dur":2,"text":"And many of them\nhistorically have APIs,"},"257":{"dur":2,"text":"depends how old\nthe cloud service was."},"260":{"dur":2,"text":"But they tended to look\na little bit like silos, and"},"262":{"dur":3,"text":"they've been developed\nindependently obviously."},"265":{"dur":3,"text":"And certainly some of them\nare different depending on whether"},"268":{"dur":2,"text":"you're logging in with a work or"},"271":{"dur":1,"text":"school account or\na personal account."},"273":{"dur":3,"text":"And historically one drive for\nbusiness and one drive for"},"277":{"dur":1,"text":"separate services."},"278":{"dur":2,"text":"And gradually we've been bringing\nthem together over the years and"},"281":{"dur":2,"text":"now they're just one\nconsistent service."},"283":{"dur":1,"text":"And so\nthat's what it tended to look like."},"285":{"dur":3,"text":"And you had these lumps and\nyou had several Office stacks for"},"289":{"dur":2,"text":"accessing and depending which side\nof the business you were coming"},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"in from, personal or\nwork and school."},"294":{"dur":4,"text":"And now we've pull all that back\ntogether into this consolidated API"},"299":{"dur":0,"text":"service."},"300":{"dur":1,"text":"Ad that really makes\na huge difference,"},"302":{"dur":3,"text":"as you'll see in a second, from a\nlearning point of view particularly."},"305":{"dur":1,"text":"So when I'm actually saying,"},"307":{"dur":4,"text":"hey, my application connected\nto one Microsoft cloud service,"},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"then the incremental cost to go and\nconnect to another one."},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"When my boss says to me, hey,\nwell, you did that integration"},"317":{"dur":2,"text":"with Outlook, but can you now go and\nintegrate with OneDrive?"},"320":{"dur":3,"text":"That used to be, hey, I'll go and\nlearn the next API for Microsoft."},"323":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'll go and\nlearn how to do the auth for that."},"326":{"dur":4,"text":"And now it's really a much,\nmuch more fractional cost."},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"Because it's always on the same\nAPI surface with the same style of"},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"documentation, the same\nstyle of API, as we'll see."},"337":{"dur":3,"text":"So to make that more concrete, here\nare some examples of what the APIs"},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"used to look like for\npre-Microsoft Graph."},"343":{"dur":4,"text":"And you can see, I've just\nobviously got the URLs up here,"},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"not the response\npackets from the APIs."},"350":{"dur":5,"text":"But even the URLs, there was an\nawful lot of diversity among those,"},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"whether they were personal or\nwork APIs."},"358":{"dur":3,"text":"But just the API shapes themselves\nwere very different, and"},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"you can imagine the response\npackets from these tended to be"},"365":{"dur":1,"text":"really quite different\nfrom each other."},"366":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's just a natural consequence\nof the evolution of the service,"},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"being built at different\ntimes by different teams."},"372":{"dur":3,"text":"So that job of bringing them\ntogether under the Microsoft Graph"},"375":{"dur":3,"text":"involved pulling them together\ninto a consistent API service and"},"378":{"dur":1,"text":"URL service which you can see here."},"380":{"dur":3,"text":"And also taking those response\npackets and standardizing them, and"},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"bringing those together,\nmaking them easy to learn."},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"So your skills are transferable\nwhen you're doing one integration"},"389":{"dur":0,"text":"onto the next."},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's really\na super key point here."},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"Again, I wanna repeat it, that your\nskills become transferable from one"},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"Microsoft cloud service to the next."},"398":{"dur":3,"text":"And also, because you've now only\ngot one auth stack across all of"},"401":{"dur":3,"text":"these services, you are making far\nfew round trips to go and do auth,"},"405":{"dur":3,"text":"because previously you had to go and\nswap tokens between services when"},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"you wanted to move from\none service to another."},"411":{"dur":3,"text":"But now you're just on one service,\nso there's none of that in there."},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"And that can really add some\nextra perk into your application."},"417":{"dur":3,"text":"So you can see we've got a very\nconsistent surface whether I'm just"},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"driving it in to get my\nmail with new messages or"},"423":{"dur":4,"text":"then going into to get my files\nwith me drive with the children."},"427":{"dur":3,"text":"And it all just becomes\nsomething that's organized and"},"430":{"dur":3,"text":"very easy to learn with just an\nincremental amount of work to go and"},"434":{"dur":1,"text":"find out about the new URLs."},"442":{"dur":4,"text":"So let's actually make that\nreal in terms of what you"},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"can do with the Microsoft Graph."},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"Flip over to my demo machine."},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"So here we've got an application\nthat we like to keep building on"},"462":{"dur":0,"text":"incrementally."},"463":{"dur":3,"text":"It's kind of one we're building up\nforever with the Microsoft Graph,"},"466":{"dur":1,"text":"the Contoso Property Management\napplication."},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is a scenario that\nwe built, where a company,"},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"Contoso, is renting out properties,\nor"},"475":{"dur":3,"text":"rather managing property rentals\non behalf of their clients."},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"And they have people\nwho are going out and"},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"doing inspections on properties, and\nthen they're sending out repairmen"},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"when something goes wrong,\nwhether that's a leaky faucet, or"},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"broken window, or\nwhatever it might be."},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"And you've got a dispatcher who's\nsitting at the center of all this,"},"491":{"dur":1,"text":"taking in the reports\nfrom the inspections and"},"493":{"dur":1,"text":"sending out repair people."},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's a great way for us to pull\ntogether all the information and"},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"power it by the Microsoft Graph, and"},"500":{"dur":5,"text":"show just the kind of richness\nthat can be achieved."},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"And to keep adding more richness\nas we add more to the graph."},"508":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's kind of overflowing\nnow with stuff as we add more."},"512":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's go and have a look through\nsome of the things that we're"},"515":{"dur":0,"text":"pairing here from the graph."},"517":{"dur":1,"text":"So if I go down\nthe left-hand side here,"},"518":{"dur":3,"text":"the first thing you see is\nI've got them pulled together"},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"an Office 365 group for\nall of the people who"},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"work on this particular property\nthat is the Hour residence."},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"And you can see, I'm sitting here,"},"529":{"dur":3,"text":"Gareth Jones, the guy who's playing\nthe dispatcher in this case."},"533":{"dur":1,"text":"And then I've got a bunch of people."},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"I've got Rob who's going\nto run the inspections."},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'm just going to\nget these rich cards and"},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"pull information about the people."},"544":{"dur":1,"text":"So then what else have I got?"},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"I've got some\nconversations going on."},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is my conversations\nplatform from Outlook."},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"So I can go and\nsee the inspection that went on."},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"And pull that down from\nthe conversations that are going on"},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"inside that modern group."},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's just gonna take me\nstraight through to the group."},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"Or I can go into the one called\nNotes for each inspection."},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"Again pulled down from the graph."},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"And that combination of going and\nusing the API to pull"},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"the actual data through the API and\nthen getting the web links to power"},"572":{"dur":3,"text":"the URIs, that again will actually\nlet me go through in my own UI and"},"576":{"dur":3,"text":"give me a nice click-through\nexperience is really nice."},"582":{"dur":1,"text":"And then I can again go\nthrough to the email,"},"584":{"dur":1,"text":"it'll be an exchange\nby the property owner."},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"And then drill into\nsome of the files."},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is a file where we're\nmanaging the property costs"},"592":{"dur":0,"text":"in Excel, and"},"593":{"dur":3,"text":"you can see I've got a bunch of\nnice stuff there running in Excel."},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"And I can go and pull\nthe thumbnail out to the file Using"},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"the OneDrive API, it's exposed\non the Microsoft Graph, and"},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"I've got that thumbnail with\nthe primary image out of the file."},"605":{"dur":3,"text":"And looking at it just as a simple\nfile, that's the thumbnail."},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"But it's an Excel file, so\nI can do much better than that."},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"So if I go back up to the top here,"},"614":{"dur":3,"text":"you can see that I've actually\ndived into this file."},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"Using the fact that Excel is exposed\non the Microsoft graph is a rich"},"621":{"dur":3,"text":"service for me to go and\nactually go and do data analysis, or"},"624":{"dur":3,"text":"to pull out information and\nanalytics."},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'm going in here."},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"And if you take a look at my\nInspections cost, you can see that"},"633":{"dur":4,"text":"I've got graphs and I've got\nworksheets powering those graphs."},"637":{"dur":3,"text":"And I can go and get that raw\ndata directly into my application"},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"straight through the API."},"642":{"dur":3,"text":"So I've gone and pulled in\nthe summaries of those tables and"},"645":{"dur":6,"text":"then I've also gone and pulled in\nthe graphs that are driving those."},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"So really deep integration\ndirectly with my data here."},"657":{"dur":5,"text":"Okay, so that's the kind of\nrichness that we've built, and"},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"we believe is really easy for\nyou with, and I hope you'll get from"},"665":{"dur":1,"text":"the session today that we've\nreally not too much code."},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"You can build this kind\nof rich experiences for"},"669":{"dur":1,"text":"your own line of business."},"670":{"dur":3,"text":"So."},"677":{"dur":0,"text":"Oops."},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"So what's new on the graph?"},"693":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, to set some context for"},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"that, let's talk about what's\nbeen around for the last year."},"697":{"dur":1,"text":"So we launched the graph\na little over a year ago now."},"701":{"dur":4,"text":"And we've had all of these services,\nsort of core Microsoft Cloud"},"705":{"dur":4,"text":"services like Active Directory,\nOutlook, OneDrive, available, and"},"709":{"dur":4,"text":"we got now thousands of applications\nbeing built on them over that year."},"714":{"dur":3,"text":"And you saw a bunch of\nthose in that application."},"717":{"dur":3,"text":"And what we've recently added\nto that set, the Excel API"},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"that I showed, and brought that\ninto general availability."},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"And then this week we're super\nexcited to be announcing that we're"},"727":{"dur":1,"text":"bringing to general availability."},"728":{"dur":4,"text":"So you can go to production with\nWebHooks for the OneDrive service."},"733":{"dur":3,"text":"subscribe to event changes on\nthe root of your drives in OneDrive."},"737":{"dur":3,"text":"To add to the existing WebHooks\nsupport we had for Outlook items."},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"And then the ability to extend\nthe graph with your own line of"},"744":{"dur":1,"text":"business data for Outlook items."},"747":{"dur":1,"text":"She can go and poke your data in and"},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll be sharing some more examples\nof how to use that later."},"751":{"dur":3,"text":"And then for any of you who\nsaw my talk at Belfast Spring,"},"754":{"dur":4,"text":"then we demonstrated, Elia and\nI demonstrated the scheduling API"},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"that we added for the Graph,\nthe FindMeetingTimes API."},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"And we're bringing that to\nGA over the next week or so."},"765":{"dur":4,"text":"And in preview we're really excited,\nwe got a ton of stuff that we're"},"769":{"dur":2,"text":"announcing this week in\npreview on the Graph."},"772":{"dur":1,"text":"So who wants SharePoint\non the Graph?"},"774":{"dur":3,"text":"Yes, super excited SharePoint\nsite are listed on the graphic"},"777":{"dur":0,"text":"preview for"},"778":{"dur":5,"text":"the best down-payment on getting the\nwhole of SharePoint onto the graph."},"783":{"dur":3,"text":"And then another super\nexciting area, hybrid."},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"So we really want people\nto be able to build"},"790":{"dur":1,"text":"applications against the graph."},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"We really don't care where\ntheir customer's data is."},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"They can just access it whether\nthe data is in the graph or"},"797":{"dur":1,"text":"whether the data is on premise."},"799":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's gonna be a journey for\nus, obviously that's a big feature,"},"803":{"dur":3,"text":"but our first preview for that is\nto support a preview of that with"},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"Outlook data for\non-premise Exchange

mentions."},"815":{"dur":4,"text":"So you have seen that in recent\nbuilds of the Outlook client."},"819":{"dur":2,"text":"You can now go and out-mention\nsomebody in your email and have that"},"822":{"dur":4,"text":"automatically provided as a filter\nin the UI, so we got APIs for that."},"827":{"dur":2,"text":"A bunch of you have told\nus that you really don't"},"829":{"dur":3,"text":"like all the tricky little dollars\nin our query language, so we've made"},"832":{"dur":2,"text":"all of those optional so you can\nclean up your queries a little bit."},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"You can go and upload files\nto the maximum file size"},"838":{"dur":3,"text":"that OneDrive now supports through\nthe APIs with large file

time I called?"},"907":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's a great\npair with WebBooks."},"908":{"dur":1,"text":"So I go to WebBooks and"},"909":{"dur":3,"text":"here's something that's changed and\nthen I can just go and say well,"},"913":{"dur":2,"text":"tell me what changed since\nthe last time I got a WebBook?"},"915":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's a really great way to\nadd reliability to your

starting to\nmove outside of that core Office"},"926":{"dur":3,"text":"productivity space and\nIntune is a really big play for"},"930":{"dur":3,"text":"us there to go and\nadd that whole API onto the

reporting."},"939":{"dur":1,"text":"Functionality into the graph."},"940":{"dur":4,"text":"So you go and say, hey, what's going\non, and see what kinda usage your"},"945":{"dur":2,"text":"Office 365 is going on and\nmoving that all onto the graph."},"948":{"dur":3,"text":"So a whole bunch of new stuff\nannouncing this week, and"},"952":{"dur":2,"text":"coming over the months to

hands on laps, so."},"975":{"dur":4,"text":"So I'm not gonna drill into too\nmany of those new features."},"980":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm just gonna pick\na couple of them and"},"981":{"dur":2,"text":"talk about them from the point of\nview of line of business because"},"984":{"dur":2,"text":"there are individual sessions for\nall of them."},"986":{"dur":4,"text":"And I

it's a little more interesting\ncall with groups, to go and"},"2266":{"dur":0,"text":"add a member."},"2267":{"dur":3,"text":"If you remember, we normally go and\njust say hey, get the URL

that."},"2294":{"dur":5,"text":"So I'm gonna, Add Boaty there."},"2300":{"dur":1,"text":"And then the next thing\nwe're gonna go and"},"2301":{"dur":4,"text":"do is go and pull in that

point it at the metadata and"},"2344":{"dur":1,"text":"generate your own."},"2345":{"dur":3,"text":"But I'm not gonna step through\nthe fine details of this, I'm"},"2348":{"dur":3,"text":"sure most of you know how to make\nan HTTP call with the .NET stack or"},"2351":{"dur":1,"text":"whatever stack you work on."},"2353":{"dur":3,"text":"But the interesting bit that I am\ngoing to look at is just the actual"},"2356":{"dur":2,"text":"URL that we're calling, and\nwhat comes back from the call."},"2361":{"dur":3,"text":"So here you can see that we're\ngoing into the SharePoint node

cool."},"2430":{"dur":2,"text":"This really shows that depth\nof power of the graph, so"},"2433":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm gonna call in, so\nI GetListItemsFromSiteList,"},"2436":{"dur":1,"text":"that's my

that you saw with those half\na dozen or so template tasks."},"2450":{"dur":3,"text":"So if I drop into there, again, I'm\nnot gonna step through the actual"},"2453":{"dur":1,"text":"HTTP, but\nlet's have a look at the call."},"2457":{"dur":4,"text":"So I'm calling into SharePoint\nagain in the site's collection."},"2462":{"dur":2,"text":"I've got that site ID that I\npicked up from the last call."},"2465":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'm saying, hey,\nget me the lists."},"2468":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay, that will get\nme all of the lists."},"2469":{"dur":0,"text":"I don't want all of the lists,"},"2470":{"dur":2,"text":"I just want the one with\nthe name that I specified."},"2473":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'm gonna use\na filter expression."},"2475":{"dur":2,"text":"A filter expression is how\nI do essentially a where"},"2478":{"dur":1,"text":"clause on the graph."},"2479":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I'm passing in filter, and\nI'm saying the filter equals, and"},"2482":{"dur":3,"text":"it's a bit hard to see with the URL\nencoding with the percentage."},"2486":{"dur":3,"text":"But I'm basically saying, filter is\nname equals, and then new listed."},"2492":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that gets me down to the one\nlist that I'm interested in, but"},"2494":{"dur":1,"text":"that will still just\nget me the list."},"2496":{"dur":1,"text":"What I wanted was\nthe items in the list."},"2498":{"dur":2,"text":"And actually,\nI wanted that column set data."},"2500":{"dur":3,"text":"If you remember the column set gives\nme the actual specific data

the list,"},"2512":{"dur":2,"text":"and then I gotta get the items, and\nthen I've got the column data, and"},"2514":{"dur":1,"text":"that's three round trips,"},"2515":{"dur":2,"text":"which in a web application\nis kind of no great shape."},"2518":{"dur":1,"text":"But if this is a mobile application,"},"2519":{"dur":2,"text":"three round trips is\na bit of a downer, right?"},"2521":{"dur":1,"text":"We don't really want to be\nhaving that kind of slow UI."},"2523":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I'm gonna take advantage\nof the power of the graph."},"2526":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'm gonna use that expand and\nsay, hey, all in one round trip,"},"2530":{"dur":2,"text":"I wanna get the whole lot please."},"2532":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I'm gonna say expand the items,\nso"},"2534":{"dur":3,"text":"I get the list, I'm gonna\nget the list with its items."},"2537":{"dur":1,"text":"And I can actually,\nin this case, and"},"2539":{"dur":1,"text":"you can't do this\neverywhere in the graph,"},"2540":{"dur":1,"text":"but there's a bunch of\nplaces where you can do it."},"2542":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's well worth experimenting\nto see if you can get your round"},"2544":{"dur":0,"text":"trips cut down."},"2545":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm actually gonna nest another\nexpand inside parentheses and"},"2548":{"dur":1,"text":"say hey, I'd like the items."},"2550":{"dur":2,"text":"And inside each item, I'd like to\npull in the column set, please."},"2553":{"dur":4,"text":"So, a two level expand to pull it\nall in in a single round trip,"},"2557":{"dur":1,"text":"so, pretty neat."},"2559":{"dur":2,"text":"So let's let that run\ndown to the break point."},"2562":{"dur":4,"text":"You can see it's a bit\nlonger call there cuz we"},"2566":{"dur":3,"text":"are pulling back all that data."},"2569":{"dur":2,"text":"But if we were going over\nthe Internet from a mobile app,"},"2572":{"dur":2,"text":"I'd rather trade that\nas a single round trip."},"2575":{"dur":2,"text":"So let's have a look at the payload\nthere that's coming back,"},"2578":{"dur":3,"text":"and you see, yeah, I've pulled back\na heck of a lot of the stuff that,"},"2581":{"dur":2,"text":"all just in one call,\nby doing that two level expand."},"2585":{"dur":2,"text":"All right, so I'm gonna deserialize\nthat into some prettier objects that"},"2588":{"dur":2,"text":"we can actually take a look at."},"2590":{"dur":2,"text":"Again, I just created some poke\nholes to deserialize that, and so"},"2593":{"dur":2,"text":"I've got a bunch of list items now\nthat look just exactly like those"},"2596":{"dur":1,"text":"SharePoint lists that\nI was looking at."},"2597":{"dur":2,"text":"So I've got mine set up one to one,\nso a couple of columns."},"2601":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, so I'm just gonna loop\nover that, and I'm gonna go and"},"2603":{"dur":1,"text":"make a planner task for each one."},"2605":{"dur":1,"text":"So the planner task server\nis super easy to make."},"2607":{"dur":1,"text":"You saw me just posting\nthose couple of fields."},"2609":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'm not gonna go into\nextensive detail on those,"},"2612":{"dur":2,"text":"other than to say look,\nI'm just gonna go and"},"2615":{"dur":3,"text":"make a couple of fields for each,\nand I'm gonna pass in the title."},"2618":{"dur":3,"text":"The interesting thing about planner\nis that if I wanna create the title"},"2622":{"dur":3,"text":"and the details for a planner task,\nthe way planner models act is"},"2626":{"dur":2,"text":"actually to say that details can\nbe a bunch of complicated things."},"2629":{"dur":2,"text":"it can be list, or\nit could be a whole bunch of stuff."},"2632":{"dur":2,"text":"And so it's modeled as\na second level object."},"2634":{"dur":2,"text":"So I actually do need to go and\nmake two calls for planner."},"2637":{"dur":2,"text":"So you'll see that I'm creating\nthe initial task with its title."},"2640":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I'm gonna go and\ndo a patch to go and"},"2643":{"dur":3,"text":"update it, having created it,\nand set in those details."},"2646":{"dur":4,"text":"Subobject, and in this case, I'm\ngonna set that details object just"},"2650":{"dur":2,"text":"as another piece of text\nwith a description."},"2654":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'm gonna run that again and\nwhizzed through that list and"},"2658":{"dur":1,"text":"make all of those tasks."},"2668":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, so what's the next thing?"},"2672":{"dur":3,"text":"So, given that my user\nnow has got his tasks,"},"2675":{"dur":2,"text":"I want him to have the licenses that\nhe needs to be able to do his job."},"2678":{"dur":2,"text":"He's just been brought\ninto the organization."},"2680":{"dur":1,"text":"He hasn't been set up with Office or\nInTune or"},"2682":{"dur":2,"text":"any other things that\nhe's gonna need to do."},"2684":{"dur":2,"text":"So we can do that through the graph,\nas well."},"2687":{"dur":2,"text":"And again, now,\nI'm back into release territory."},"2689":{"dur":1,"text":"So I can just use my\nsimple SDK calls."},"2691":{"dur":2,"text":"Even though this is actually\nsome quite complex logic,"},"2693":{"dur":2,"text":"it's just a few lines of code."},"2696":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I want to actually say hey,\nI'll give him a license for"},"2698":{"dur":2,"text":"everything that we've got\na license to corporately,"},"2700":{"dur":4,"text":"which perhaps is a bit unrealistic,\nbut it gives you a sense of"},"2705":{"dur":3,"text":"how we can actually work\nthrough these on the graph."},"2708":{"dur":5,"text":"So I'm gonna go and find all of\nthe things that are available"},"2713":{"dur":3,"text":"on the graph, all of the products\nthat are available, and"},"2717":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm gonna look through them."},"2718":{"dur":4,"text":"And if they're enabled in my tenant,\nthen I'm gonna say well,"},"2722":{"dur":1,"text":"have I got a license\navailable to give him?"},"2724":{"dur":1,"text":"Obviously, there's no point in\ntrying to assign a license if we"},"2726":{"dur":1,"text":"don't have any that we've paid for."},"2728":{"dur":0,"text":"So I'm gonna say,"},"2729":{"dur":2,"text":"as long as the prepaid license\nunits are more than the amount that"},"2732":{"dur":3,"text":"we've consumed, then go and\nactually assign a nice new license."},"2735":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's the same call that I\nwould use if I wanted to unassign"},"2738":{"dur":3,"text":"I'd just pass in the GUID of\nthe licenses I wanted to unassign."},"2742":{"dur":1,"text":"So we'll let that run."},"2746":{"dur":4,"text":"And then finally, he's now ready to\ngo into the inspector's group and"},"2750":{"dur":1,"text":"be ready for active duty."},"2751":{"dur":4,"text":"So, again, another call to go and\nadd to a group."},"2756":{"dur":3,"text":"And so it's that same member\nreferenced call that we made earlier"},"2759":{"dur":2,"text":"to add into the new user's group."},"2761":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay, So\nthat looks like that's worked."},"2766":{"dur":2,"text":"See what's actually happened."},"2768":{"dur":2,"text":"So if we go and now refresh this in,"},"2776":{"dur":2,"text":"In the AAD Admin page,"},"2785":{"dur":3,"text":"You can see he's now got Office and\nInTune licenses added."},"2789":{"dur":1,"text":"And he's in the getting\nstarted inspectors group."},"2792":{"dur":1,"text":"And if we go and\nlook at our planner,"},"2793":{"dur":2,"text":"then you see there's a whole\nbunch of tasks that appeared,"},"2796":{"dur":3,"text":"all of which are assigned to Barty\nand have got that description."},"2800":{"dur":1,"text":"So everything's just worked nicely."},"2803":{"dur":1,"text":"And we've made that\nsimple work flow."},"2804":{"dur":3,"text":"And really, that's, what, about 15\nlines of code to do all of that"},"2808":{"dur":3,"text":"total, and it would be a lot less,\nonce those things have gone GA and"},"2811":{"dur":2,"text":"we can just use SDKs for them."},"2817":{"dur":3,"text":"It's really easy to do that kind\nof simple workflow

rely"},"2844":{"dur":4,"text":"on much more corporate data being in\nplace to be able to actually work."},"2850":{"dur":4,"text":"But how aware are you of the quality\nof the corporate data when
