might sound pretty abstract\nor far away in the future for you,"},"35":{"dur":4,"text":"but I hope that the story of how\nI've had an impact at such a young age"},"40":{"dur":3,"text":"will show you that \nit's not rocket science,"},"43":{"dur":3,"text":"you have no excuses, \nand you can start now."},"50":{"dur":3,"text":"So, what kind of impact have I had?"},"55":{"dur":4,"text":"I finished my PhD in Psychiatry \nat Oxford University at 23,"},"59":{"dur":4,"text":"and by that point, I've already had\nan impact on the pool of knowledge"},"64":{"dur":2,"text":"in the field of neuroscience."},"66":{"dur":4,"text":"I've also contributed to several \nmental health programs,"},"71":{"dur":3,"text":"and things related to substance abuse"},"74":{"dur":2,"text":"while I was

than what \nI've actually done is how I have done it."},"95":{"dur":4,"text":"And I will concentrate, \nin particular, on high school time,"},"100":{"dur":2,"text":"to make it as tangible \nas possible for you."},"104":{"dur":3,"text":"So the first thing you need is direction."},"109":{"dur":1,"text":"Just choose a direction."},"112":{"dur":4,"text":"It can be a goal, it can be a dream"},"117":{"dur":1,"text":"or it can be a vague idea."},"120":{"dur":3,"text":"My godmother told me I could become\nan international researcher,"},"124":{"dur":3,"text":"and I thought it was a

enough,"},"135":{"dur":2,"text":"you're going to come up with \nsome cool things on the way."},"138":{"dur":1,"text":"It wasn't a real goal,"},"140":{"dur":4,"text":"it was just something to get me started \nand move towards a good direction."},"145":{"dur":3,"text":"And the third thing I had \nas a goal when I was your age"},"150":{"dur":4,"text":"was actually going to a top university."},"155":{"dur":3,"text":"And this might sound obvious to you, \nbut when I think about it in hindsight,"},"159":{"dur":2,"text":"my motivation for it \nwasn't entirely selfless,"},"162":{"dur":4,"text":"I wanted to show the people who bullied me\nat school that I can make it somewhere."},"166":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, what I've just told you, \nis that you can choose any direction,"},"171":{"dur":3,"text":"it doesn't have to be your own, \nit doesn't have to be your real goal,"},"175":{"dur":2,"text":"and it doesn't have to be \nout of selfless motivation."},"178":{"dur":3,"text":"The perfect example of it \nnot having to be a selfless motivation"},"181":{"dur":3,"text":"is Marc Burnett, the producer\nof the MTV Music Awards."},"186":{"dur":2,"text":"He once gave a talk and said"},"188":{"dur":4,"text":"that he wanted to become \na producer because chicks like it."},"195":{"dur":3,"text":"And it doesn't matter, that's \nabsolutely fine as a motivation,"},"198":{"dur":2,"text":"he's had a great impact on our world."},"201":{"dur":2,"text":"The other thing is, also \nwhen you choose that direction,"},"204":{"dur":2,"text":"your starting point doesn't matter."},"206":{"dur":3,"text":"A dear friend of mine found himself \nin jail in the Ukrainian countryside"},"209":{"dur":2,"text":"and he still decided at that point"},"212":{"dur":2,"text":"he's going to take \na more positive direction."},"214":{"dur":2,"text":"And he made it into\nHarvard Business School,"},"216":{"dur":2,"text":"and he's been doing similar work \nlike me around the world."},"223":{"dur":5,"text":"The second need is \nsay yes to opportunities."},"230":{"dur":4,"text":"I always say yes to any opportunity \nalong that direction I've chosen,"},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"without overthinking it."},"236":{"dur":3,"text":"So one of the goals I told you about\nwas going to a top university."},"241":{"dur":1,"text":"So what did I do?"},"242":{"dur":3,"text":"Without overthinking it, I've found\na list of top universities,"},"245":{"dur":3,"text":"chose Cambridge and MIT on the list,\nprinted out the application papers"},"248":{"dur":2,"text":"filled them out, \nticked every possible box,"},"251":{"dur":3,"text":"including all the scholarships \nthat I had no clue about,"},"254":{"dur":3,"text":"turned up at the interviews\nand, for example, at Cambridge"},"257":{"dur":3,"text":"I just went to the bar \nand watched \"Life of Brian\""},"261":{"dur":2,"text":"and then I went to my exams\nthe next morning."},"263":{"dur":2,"text":"The others had actually \nbeen studying the night before."},"266":{"dur":3,"text":"But I did get in, \nI even got that scholarship."},"269":{"dur":1,"text":"So you didn't have to overthink it"},"271":{"dur":3,"text":"or prepare in a very serious manner\nfor that direction or having said yes."},"275":{"dur":5,"text":"Same with MIT, the night before \nthe SATs, the university examinations,"},"281":{"dur":4,"text":"I actually sat with my friend Cathrine\nand we were thinking:"},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Yeah, so we've filled in \nthose applications,"},"290":{"dur":3,"text":"but we haven't actually signed up\nfor the entrance exams,\""},"293":{"dur":2,"text":"so we've realised:\n\"OK, tomorrow's the entrance exam,"},"296":{"dur":2,"text":"we'll have to go \nand we'll sign up on the day.\""},"299":{"dur":3,"text":"That's what we did, and we realised \nalso it's maths and English exam,"},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"neither of us was \na native English speaker,"},"305":{"dur":2,"text":"so we went and got \nthe dictionary out that night,"},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"- it was maybe 11 o'clock at night -"},"310":{"dur":3,"text":"and she opened the first page \nand the first word: quinquagenarian."},"315":{"dur":1,"text":"Anybody know what that is?"},"317":{"dur":2,"text":"We were like, \"Oh, dear Lord...\""},"319":{"dur":3,"text":"It's somebody who's between \nthe age of 50 and 59, inclusive."},"323":{"dur":3,"text":"We decided, \"Fine, that's enough.\nWe're just going to go the cinema.\""},"326":{"dur":2,"text":"But, I did get into MIT."},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm not very proud of how \nI got into these universities,"},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"I actually got into\n12 top universities in the end,"},"336":{"dur":1,"text":"and I did it without overthinking it."},"338":{"dur":1,"text":"What would it be to say:"},"340":{"dur":2,"text":"\"No, I won't print out \nthose applications forms"},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"and fill them out,\"\nand I'm very happy I did"},"345":{"dur":3,"text":"because I didn't come up with the excuse:"},"348":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Oh, I'm not good enough\nfor any of that;\" my teachers did, though."},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"They told me:\n\"You're never going to get into MIT.\""},"353":{"dur":3,"text":"But I was like: \"Well, what am I going \nto lose from filling out this application?"},"357":{"dur":3,"text":"How are you going to know \nif you're good enough, if you don't try?"},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's often something \nyou've done way before,"},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"that's going to help you \nin that situation."},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"So maybe I didn't study for my SATs,"},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"maybe I didn't study for \nmy Cambridge entrance exam,"},"370":{"dur":3,"text":"but I had earlier listened at school,\nI have done my homework,"},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"and I even had extracurricular activities."},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"At school they offered Latin or maths."},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"My parents said Latin is a dead language,"},"382":{"dur":3,"text":"so I was: \"OK, I'll just go \nto the math club then.\""},"385":{"dur":4,"text":"And I went every singe week \nto the math club as the only student."},"391":{"dur":3,"text":"Nobody else went. It wasn't \na particularly cool thing to do."},"394":{"dur":3,"text":"But that probably helped me\nlater on in life."},"399":{"dur":4,"text":"So, third thing you need \nis figuring out your character,"},"405":{"dur":1,"text":"and what are your character's strengths."},"407":{"dur":1,"text":"So you should do a test and find out,"},"410":{"dur":1,"text":"and use those wisely."},"412":{"dur":3,"text":"One of my character strengths is bravery."},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"So as I told you, if you have a direction,"},"418":{"dur":4,"text":"you say yes to any opportunity \nthat is along that way."},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"I also say yes to that direction \nand any opportunity along that way"},"427":{"dur":1,"text":"because I'm brave."},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"So, for example, politics \nis not one of those things"},"431":{"dur":1,"text":"I've been planning to do,"},"432":{"dur":1,"text":"but when I was 15 years old"},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"I saw a newspaper article \nabout an EU politics event,"},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"and I signed up."},"441":{"dur":3,"text":"And I turned up and little did I know\nthe event was for only about 50 people,"},"445":{"dur":3,"text":"and all of them were \ntop politicians in Frankfurt."},"449":{"dur":1,"text":"So I was in the lift,"},"450":{"dur":3,"text":"chit-chatting to the mayor \nof Frankfurt, Petra Roth, at the time."},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"And it all went fine,"},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"and when they asked me \nwho was I representing, I said,"},"459":{"dur":4,"text":"International Institute in Oberursel,\nread the Frankfurt International School."},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"But it all went fine."},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"If I had wanted to become a politician, \nmaybe that was the one opportunity"},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"that would have changed\nmy direction in life."},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"So, on top of direction,"},"476":{"dur":4,"text":"chance and character, \nyou also need investment."},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"What comes to mind \nwhen I say investment?"},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe angel investors?"},"488":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe the stock market?"},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"You certainly don't think of somebody\nsitting in a dusty library"},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"reading books in the middle of the night."},"498":{"dur":3,"text":"I have read books, \nbut I really don't like it."},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's not what got me \nthrough high school,"},"504":{"dur":1,"text":"it's not what got me through university,"},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"it's not what got me \nthrough my job interviews,"},"508":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's certainly not what \nhas got me through life so far."},"513":{"dur":4,"text":"What my investments \nhave been is that one, I listened."},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"At university I only ever \nmissed two lectures,"},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"and those were also \nfor a very good reason."},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"So I always went and listened."},"525":{"dur":4,"text":"Number two, I drew. \nAll my lectures notes are pretty pictures."},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"And my revision notes are very, \nvery pretty and memorable pictures,"},"533":{"dur":3,"text":"I can even remember now \nand helped me get through my life."},"537":{"dur":4,"text":"Number three, I slept. \nMostly 8.5 hours, every night."},"544":{"dur":2,"text":"And number four, I said yes."},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"And that is an investment, \nyou have no idea how hard it is"},"550":{"dur":3,"text":"to say yes to every party \nand every dinner party, and every concert,"},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"and every meeting there is,\nif you can possibly make it."},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"But, if you say yes to all of those, \nyou might say yes to ten events"},"561":{"dur":2,"text":"and one of those is the one \nwhere you will realise:"},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Yes, this is actually \nwhere I want to go,\""},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"and you can shift \nyour direction in that case."},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"Last and least."},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"Least, you need talent."},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"The one thing \nI'm really not talented at is sport."},"582":{"dur":3,"text":"I remember sitting underneath \na tree when I was about six years old"},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"and feeling really embarrassed\nabout myself."},"587":{"dur":4,"text":"I was a chubby girl \nand I was so bad at sport, but I thought:"},"593":{"dur":4,"text":"\"If I ever become a sportsman, \nI'm going to give a speech and tell people"},"598":{"dur":3,"text":"that even if you're a chubby kid\nat six, you can make it."},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm not a sportsman, \nsorry to disappoint you."},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"But, I did decide that I want the top mark"},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"at my upper secondary school diploma,"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"is what I think \nyou call it here in Finland."},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"And I did get that mark, it was \nthe toughest mark to get though."},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"I had to swim a heck of a lot\nto get to that top mark."},"622":{"dur":3,"text":"It was much more difficult \nthan any of my other grades that I got."},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"I've also got \nthe Varsity Cross Country Running prize."},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"And I even got a silver medal"},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"in the national running championships\nthis year."},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"So even though I don't have talent,\nyou can get pretty far."},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"I always liked to be honest, though."},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"And, there is about 1% of things\nthat even I can't do."},"647":{"dur":3,"text":"And there's going to be \n1% of things that even you can't do."},"650":{"dur":3,"text":"And you have to accept that,\nand that's where you need the talent,"},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"and appreciation of your talent\nfor that one last percent."},"659":{"dur":3,"text":"Don't be daunted by the fact that \nI've told you to choose the direction now,"},"663":{"dur":3,"text":"it doesn't have to be\nyour ultimate direction"},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"because you can't choose that now."},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"The last ingredient \nthat you need for deciding"},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"where you are going to go\nwhen having that impact,"},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"are your own values and they change."},"677":{"dur":3,"text":"These were the values \nthat I had about ten years ago."},"683":{"dur":4,"text":"It was adventure, it was excellence,\nand it was achievement."},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"I got the adventure that I wanted."},"693":{"dur":3,"text":"In DR Congo I just escaped \nthe ebola outbreak"},"696":{"dur":3,"text":"by going through the border\nfive minutes just before it closed,"},"699":{"dur":4,"text":"I got onto a speedboat, wearing \nmy Bond-girl, see-through outfit,"},"704":{"dur":4,"text":"- I've lost my luggage and I was\nwearing a local trend outfit,"},"709":{"dur":1,"text":"which was see-through -"},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"only to get to the other side,"},"713":{"dur":1,"text":"get to Nigeria, and realise,"},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"there was a bomb threat\nand an arm attack ahead of me."},"718":{"dur":5,"text":"It was thrilling, I must admit, \nbut I was there mainly to save the world."},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm still saving the world,"},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"now I'm doing it \nthrough a gene risk project"},"733":{"dur":3,"text":"which starts next year and aims \nto use genetic information"},"736":{"dur":3,"text":"to improve our health \nand wealthfare here in Finland."},"742":{"dur":4,"text":"But I'm also trying to save myself, \nand do good things to myself."},"749":{"dur":3,"text":"This started all about a year ago,\nwhen I was at the training programme,"},"753":{"dur":3,"text":"and I was given a stack of cards,\nvery similar to these ones."},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"And I had to choose my top three values,"},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"and the ones I chose were these:"},"764":{"dur":3,"text":"happiness, kindness, and health."},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"I compared them to the guy next to me,"},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"and he had power, and money,\nand all those kinds of things,"},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"and I had happiness, kindness, and health."},"778":{"dur":1,"text":"And I compared them to what I was doing,"},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"and realised, I'm going \nto change my life now."},"782":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's what I did."},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"Because I believe \nthat society doesn't work"},"788":{"dur":3,"text":"unless each and everyone \nof us are feeling happy,"},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"healthy, and we're kind to each other."},"796":{"dur":3,"text":"Ten years from now, \nmy values might look like this."},"800":{"dur":2,"text":"And hopefully, by then I'll learn \nto balance even better"},"803":{"dur":6,"text":"my impact on society, my impact on me, \nand my impact on my
