learnt from Coleridge,"},"2748":{"dur":2,"text":"which made me think very carefully"},"2752":{"dur":4,"text":"was his friendship with a\nyoung chemist, Humphry Davy."},"2756":{"dur":3,"text":"This is in West Country when\nthey were both 20 year olds."},"2760":{"dur":2,"text":"Davy, extraordinary man, self taught,"},"2762":{"dur":2,"text":"who would go on to become\nPresident of the Royal

effect."},"2789":{"dur":2,"text":"Now the most interesting thing about this"},"2792":{"dur":2,"text":"is that Coleridge's statements,"},"2796":{"dur":3,"text":"witness statements given\nto the scientist Davy"},"2799":{"dur":3,"text":"are amazingly closely\nconnected to his descriptions"},"2803":{"dur":3,"text":"of taking opium and indeed Kubla Khan."},"2807":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's suddenly this\nextraordinary bridge"},"2810":{"dur":1,"text":"between the scientific experiment"},"2811":{"dur":2,"text":"and what you might call\na poetic experiment."},"2814":{"dur":2,"text":"Now that really made me think."},"2817":{"dur":1,"text":"And looking more carefully,"},"2818":{"dur":2,"text":"I found that this area\ncompletely opened up."},"2821":{"dur":3,"text":"For example, there was a very\ninteresting correspondence"},"2824":{"dur":1,"text":"which went on for several weeks"},"2825":{"dur":4,"text":"between Davy and Coleridge\non the nature of pain."},"2830":{"dur":1,"text":"Because what Davy had discovered"},"2832":{"dur":4,"text":"was that nitrous oxide\ncould act as an anesthetic"},"2837":{"dur":3,"text":"and he wrote a paper saying\nit could be used in surgery."},"2840":{"dur":1,"text":"Now this is an absolutely radical idea,"},"2842":{"dur":2,"text":"the very notion of\nanesthesia didn't exist."},"2844":{"dur":2,"text":"Most

anesthetic."},"2861":{"dur":3,"text":"So Davy was absolutely on the edge of"},"2864":{"dur":2,"text":"a major scientific revolution."},"2868":{"dur":4,"text":"They discussed the nature of\npain, what's its function?"},"2872":{"dur":3,"text":"Starting with a quite sort\nof clinical approach to it,"},"2876":{"dur":1,"text":"was it good for people to feel pain?"},"2878":{"dur":2,"text":"Did it become part of the healing process?"},"2880":{"dur":2,"text":"And then Coleridge leading on saying,"},"2882":{"dur":3,"text":"but what is its function\ngenerally, philosophically?"},"2886":{"dur":1,"text":"Why do we feel pain?"},"2888":{"dur":4,"text":"Or as he would say, why did\nGod give us pain to feel?"},"2892":{"dur":1,"text":"What's that about?"},"2893":{"dur":4,"text":"And particularly he said,\nwhy do women in childbirth,"},"2897":{"dur":2,"text":"which surely should be\nnature's great gift,"},"2900":{"dur":2,"text":"why is it so painful?"},"2902":{"dur":2,"text":"Very very interesting discussion begins."},"2904":{"dur":2,"text":"And again, this sort of alerted\nme, I thought wait a minute,"},"2907":{"dur":1,"text":"there's something else\ncompletely going on here,"},"2909":{"dur":4,"text":"the poet and the scientist\nbeginning to talk in this way."},"2914":{"dur":2,"text":"The only thing, I actually\nwrote a radio play"},"2916":{"dur":2,"text":"about this called Anesthesia,\nand the tragic thing,"},"2918":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's also something very\nimportant about science."},"2920":{"dur":2,"text":"Although Davy published\nthat paper on anesthesia,"},"2923":{"dur":4,"text":"he then went to London\nand he started working"},"2927":{"dur":4,"text":"on electricity and he dropped\nthe subject of nitrous oxide"},"2933":{"dur":3,"text":"and it was never taken\nforward for 40 years."},"2936":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was here in America that the role"},"2939":{"dur":2,"text":"of anesthetics was discovered."},"2942":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's also very interesting,"},"2944":{"dur":2,"text":"how a scientific breakthrough\ncan be on the edge of it,"},"2947":{"dur":1,"text":"biographically it's very interesting,"},"2948":{"dur":2,"text":"but it does not come through."},"2951":{"dur":4,"text":"So there were all kinds of\nvery interesting crossovers."},"2955":{"dur":4,"text":"Now while all this is happening\nto me, making me think,"},"2961":{"dur":3,"text":"something happened, which changed my mind"},"2964":{"dur":3,"text":"and this was, I was suddenly invited

people."},"3007":{"dur":4,"text":"It was quite small, I had\nabout 16 students every year."},"3012":{"dur":2,"text":"I had an astonishing range of backgrounds"},"3014":{"dur":3,"text":"and also age groups, from\n20 to 60, my students were."},"3018":{"dur":2,"text":"And that was amazingly good, it worked."},"3020":{"dur":2,"text":"Because you're studying\nbiography, life
