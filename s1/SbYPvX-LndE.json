was growing up,"},"218":{"dur":1,"text":"almost like clinical."},"220":{"dur":3,"text":"Where it was identifying\nthe parts of a cell."},"223":{"dur":2,"text":"Whereas when it really gets\nfun is the

you bring an artist\ninto a scientific field or vice"},"269":{"dur":2,"text":"versa, you come up with\nthe most beautiful things."},"271":{"dur":2,"text":"Look at kinetic sculptures,\nwhen you take science"},"274":{"dur":3,"text":"and apply it to art and you make\nthese incredible moving pieces."},"277":{"dur":1,"text":"I think it works the same way."},"279":{"dur":2,"text":"You just have a\ndifferent approach."},"281":{"dur":2,"text":"And over the years, I've\nlearned that art and science are"},"284":{"dur":1,"text":"pretty much in the same vein."},"286":{"dur":1,"text":"JAMES

the years?"},"299":{"dur":3,"text":"KARI BYRON: Never\nunderestimate young people."},"302":{"dur":4,"text":"Because they are so much\nmore sophisticated than I"},"306":{"dur":0,"text":"was as a

of it the\nway I probably would now."},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"For me, when I was\ntraveling that's"},"373":{"dur":3,"text":"where I really learned\nhow to say why not"},"376":{"dur":1,"text":"and to go for opportunities."},"378":{"dur":2,"text":"Because I was traveling\nalone around the world."},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"I had a friend to\nstart with, but then we"},"382":{"dur":0,"text":"went our

like that is what\nled me into \"MythBusters\""},"392":{"dur":0,"text":"to start with."},"393":{"dur":4,"text":"Because I tried advertising\nand I was bored."},"398":{"dur":1,"text":"And I tried all these\ndifferent careers."},"399":{"dur":2,"text":"And I just couldn't find myself."},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"And I came to \"MythBusters\"\nin my late 20s."},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"But I was ready to\njust work for free."},"408":{"dur":1,"text":"I was like, you know,\nI will be an intern."},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"Because I want to do\nsculpture and special effects"},"412":{"dur":1,"text":"seems like an easy\nfit, because you guys"},"414":{"dur":1,"text":"get paid to do sculptures."},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"How did I know it was a\ndying art at the time?"},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"The practical effects were just\ncrumbling beneath the crushing"},"422":{"dur":1,"text":"computer industry."},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"But I really, really\nwanted to learn how"},"427":{"dur":1,"text":"to have an interesting life."},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I thought if I\njust do it for free,"},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"sooner or later I will\nprove myself worthy"},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"and maybe they'll pay me."},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"JAMES MOREHEAD: Now you had a\nlong run with \"MythBusters.\""},"436":{"dur":2,"text":"Was there ever a point where\nyou wavered or it got

into it?"},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"And they all had these\ngreat stories of triumph"},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"to get to where they were."},"573":{"dur":4,"text":"But mostly, supportive
