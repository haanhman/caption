of it, in fact, that\nwhen we went out shopping"},"272":{"dur":3,"text":"after lunch, my stomach started to feel,"},"277":{"dur":2,"text":"a little bit bad."},"279":{"dur":3,"text":"And within about

listening."},"321":{"dur":3,"text":"So I said to Mrs. N.

guys'\ntoilets, you know guys are in"},"353":{"dur":0,"text":"and out."},"355":{"dur":1,"text":"Like in seconds."},"358":{"dur":3,"text":"Japan, on the other hand,\npeople, I don't know what they"},"361":{"dur":1,"text":"do in the cubicles."},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"Are they sleeping in there, reading books?"},"366":{"dur":1,"text":"Having a rest?"},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't know, but they\nspend, guys spend so long"},"370":{"dur":2,"text":"in the toilet in Japan."},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"So I was really really worried\nthat I was gonna get there"},"374":{"dur":4,"text":"and there would be no cubicles\nfree and I was gonna have"},"379":{"dur":3,"text":"to stand there and try\nto hold it in the queue."},"383":{"dur":1,"text":"And that wasn't gonna happen."},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"That was not happening."},"386":{"dur":1,"text":"But anyway, I found the toilet."},"388":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was right opposite a Starbucks."},"391":{"dur":4,"text":"That's kind of important,\nbecause it meant that on this"},"395":{"dur":4,"text":"crowded Sunday afternoon,\nthere were loads of people just"},"399":{"dur":1,"text":"stood around."},"400":{"dur":1,"text":"Drinking their coffee."},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was pretty crowded,\nand I had to kind of push"},"406":{"dur":4,"text":"my way through people\nto get to the toilet."},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"Which I did, pretty much\njust barged my way through"},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"because I couldn't wait."},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"And go into the toilet, and\nwhen I got in there, to my"},"418":{"dur":1,"text":"amazement, it was completely empty."},"420":{"dur":1,"text":"There were no people in\nthere, or at least no people"},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"outside in there at all."},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"And, there were loads\nand loads of cubicles."},"427":{"dur":0,"text":"Wow!"},"429":{"dur":3,"text":"This place is really,\nreally got it right when it"},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"comes to toilets."},"435":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, a few of them were\noccupied but where was one"},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"right in front of me that\nwas completely empty,"},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"completely open, great!"},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"So I dove in there and,"},"444":{"dur":0,"text":"in a panic,"},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"pulled my jeans down."},"449":{"dur":3,"text":"Milliseconds before I\nwas able to empty my gut."},"456":{"dur":3,"text":"Rather noisily into the toilet bowl."},"459":{"dur":1,"text":"Too much information, I know."},"461":{"dur":1,"text":"You're welcome."},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"It was pretty noisy, it was pretty smelly,"},"466":{"dur":1,"text":"it was pretty gross."},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"You get the idea."},"472":{"dur":4,"text":"Yes, I had a bit of\ndiarrhoea, I had the shits."},"476":{"dur":3,"text":"Again, too much information\nI know, but this is"},"480":{"dur":1,"text":"kind of important."},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"Because you see, you know I'm a guy."},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"Blokes, yeah, we can get away with this."},"487":{"dur":4,"text":"Blokes are smelly, we\nfart, you know, we can"},"492":{"dur":1,"text":"get away with this."},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"But then I heard voices."},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"Right outside the cubicle door."},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"And I thought wait a minute."},"506":{"dur":1,"text":"Those voices,"},"508":{"dur":1,"text":"aren't men's voices."},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"It was definitely a\ngirl's voice I just heard."},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"And I looked down and\nI saw the bin for used"},"517":{"dur":1,"text":"sanitary towels."},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"And then I realised,"},"525":{"dur":4,"text":"that's why there were so\nmany cubicles in this toilet!"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"And now I think about it and no urinals!"},"533":{"dur":1,"text":"(gasps)"},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"And I realised I was\nin the girls' toilets!"},"538":{"dur":0,"text":"It was me,"},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"this foreign guy in Japan,"},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"having very smelly, noisy diarrhoea,"},"547":{"dur":1,"text":"in the girls' toilets."},"550":{"dur":0,"text":"Oh my god!"},"555":{"dur":0,"text":"I thought,"},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"this is terrible, this is a disaster!"},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"Not only is it a disaster\nbut if I get caught in here,"},"562":{"dur":4,"text":"they're gonna call the\nsecurity guards and the police"},"567":{"dur":3,"text":"are gonna come and I'm\ngonna, they're gonna take"},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"my visa away and kick me out of Japan."},"573":{"dur":4,"text":"A bit extreme maybe, but\nthat's how it felt at the time."},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"I was like what am I gonna do?"},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"I thought I know, I'll call my wife and,"},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"I can get her to come\nand she can tell me when"},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"the coast is clear."},"587":{"dur":4,"text":"But I didn't have my phone\nwith me, my phone was in my bag"},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"that I'd left with my wife."},"595":{"dur":1,"text":"I didn't have a choice."},"599":{"dur":1,"text":"So, I finished up."},"602":{"dur":1,"text":"Finished my business."},"606":{"dur":4,"text":"And, feeling like a total\nidiot, I stood there for ages"},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"and ages and ages and I just,"},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"with my ear to the door,"},"621":{"dur":0,"text":"listening."},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"As carefully as I could."},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"Until the coast was clear."},"632":{"dur":3,"text":"And I listened, and I\nlistened, and I listened."},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"And finally, finally,"},"638":{"dur":1,"text":"everything was quiet."},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"Now's my chance, I\nthought, now's my chance."},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"Gotta get out without being seen."},"647":{"dur":3,"text":"Now this toilet was\nshaped kind of like an L."},"653":{"dur":4,"text":"So the door, the entrance,\nand the sinks are all"},"657":{"dur":3,"text":"one part of the L and then\nyou go around the corner"},"661":{"dur":1,"text":"to the cubicles."},"665":{"dur":1,"text":"But it seemed like it was\nempty, it seemed like the"},"667":{"dur":4,"text":"coast was clear, so I opened\nthe door, peered around."},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"Couldn't see anybody, now's my chance!"},"674":{"dur":1,"text":"And, very calmly,"},"678":{"dur":3,"text":"walked around the corner,\nstraight into three girls"},"682":{"dur":3,"text":"doing their makeup in the mirror."},"685":{"dur":2,"text":"And there was no way to\nget out without going"},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"straight past them."},"691":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't know if they noticed me."},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"Well no, they did, they\ndid notice me, there was no"},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"two ways about it, they noticed me."},"697":{"dur":1,"text":"But there was nothing I could do."},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"I was busted, as it were."},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"So I just, I smiled."},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"And I walked calmly past them."},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"And the second I was out the door,"},"712":{"dur":0,"text":"I ran."},"714":{"dur":1,"text":"I ran for dear life."},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"The lesson here, the lesson\nhere I guess is well,"},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"first of all check that you're\ngoing into the right toilet."},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"Like I said, there was a\nbig crowd of people outside"},"729":{"dur":1,"text":"and when I'd left the spot there was a big"},"730":{"dur":3,"text":"crowd of people, and I\njust, I thought I was going"},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"into the guys' and I went into the girls'."},"736":{"dur":4,"text":"It was very embarrassing, and\nI told Mrs. Northbrook and she"},"741":{"dur":3,"text":"laughed at me for quite a\nlong time and she's still"},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"taking the piss out of me about it now."},"748":{"dur":1,"text":"But there is, there is\na

whatever."},"793":{"dur":4,"text":"The point is, you know we\nall do stupid, silly things."},"797":{"dur":0,"text":"And,"},"800":{"dur":3,"text":"you can try and hide that,\nyou can try and hide mistakes"},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"you made, you can try and hide\nthe silly things that you do."},"808":{"dur":2,"text":"But you can never really hide them."},"814":{"dur":2,"text":"And when you try to do it,"},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"I think it shows."},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"People can see that you're\ntrying really hard to"},"822":{"dur":1,"text":"hide something."},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"Whether it's something\nsilly that you've done,"},"827":{"dur":3,"text":"something embarrassing, or\nit's an aspect of yourself"},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"that you

way."},"868":{"dur":3,"text":"And that is extremely uncharismatic."},"872":{"dur":3,"text":"On the other hand, if you\ndo something embarrassing,"},"875":{"dur":3,"text":"if there is an aspect of

at me, I did something\nsilly, (immitates laughter)"},"911":{"dur":3,"text":"You bring it to the forefront\nand laugh at yourself."},"914":{"dur":4,"text":"What you will find is that\ninstead of people thinking"},"919":{"dur":4,"text":"negatively of you, people\nwill laugh not at you,"},"925":{"dur":1,"text":"but along with you."},"928":{"dur":4,"text":"It makes you look confident,\nmakes you look self secure."},"932":{"dur":2,"text":"It makes you look strong."},"935":{"dur":4,"text":"It, in a nutshell, makes\nyou a charismatic
