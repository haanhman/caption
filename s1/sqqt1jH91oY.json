care"},"6808":{"dur":4,"text":"passionately about what they do and\ntherefore engage about the way in which\nthey're managed."},"6813":{"dur":3,"text":"So some of the issues that staff\nhave raised we are addressing."},"6817":{"dur":5,"text":"One of the big concerns is there's a\ngreat turnover of staff, both coming into"},"6822":{"dur":3,"text":"the NCSC and moving out into the rest\nof the

temps."},"6843":{"dur":3,"text":"So the opportunity to do that, which\nwill be happening in the next few weeks,"},"6847":{"dur":3,"text":"is a big opportunity for us to say\nwe're going to do this in a different way,"},"6851":{"dur":3,"text":"a way that reflects some of the values\nissues that we've discussed, much more"},"6855":{"dur":5,"text":"transparent because there are concerns\nthere's a

around how performance is"},"6906":{"dur":5,"text":"managed and people being concerned\nabout appraisal and performance\nreview."},"6911":{"dur":4,"text":"Again one of the conversations we're\nhaving is, because it is a large group"},"6916":{"dur":4,"text":"with lot of team leaders and line\nmanagers, is actually looking to have"},"6921":{"dur":4,"text":"fewer performance managers but

people to work hard and be\ndedicated but some of the hours people"},"7004":{"dur":2,"text":"are working are really quite long."},"7007":{"dur":6,"text":"So I would hope as we recruit and\nchange, I'd expect that would change,"},"7014":{"dur":4,"text":"you know, because I don't think it's\nsustainable and I'd be looking really"},"7018":{"dur":4,"text":"quite hard that that is being

to as well as sort of support"},"7036":{"dur":4,"text":"and listen to our staff,\nbut look after them as well a bit."},"7040":{"dur":7,"text":"So in time I'd be quite interested to\nknow a bit more about what we could do\naround that."},"7049":{"dur":5,"text":"Finally the last issue which, it is\nan operational issue, but I will raise it"},"7055":{"dur":6,"text":"anyway, is that I'm being told that staff\nare doing lots of overtime but they don't"},"7061":{"dur":5,"text":"know if they're going to be paid for their\novertime and they're saying we can't"},"7066":{"dur":4,"text":"take time in
