choice,"},"436":{"dur":3,"text":"their choice in where they receive these services"},"439":{"dur":5,"text":"and supports, whether in an institution or in a community."},"445":{"dur":3,"text":"And what

you."},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"That's the institutional bias that exists in Medicaid."},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"They have to pay for you if you're in a nursing home"},"484":{"dur":4,"text":"and they

we now do this?"},"871":{"dur":1,"text":"People with disabilities from other countries."},"872":{"dur":2,"text":"How can we get our laws changed?"},"874":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, about eleven years ago, the United Nations set up a"},"879":{"dur":5,"text":"committee to look at this and out of this came the"},"884":{"dur":3,"text":"U.N. Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities,"},"888":{"dur":3,"text":"the CRPD as we call it."},"892":{"dur":5,"text":"And that treaty was sent to our president,"},"897":{"dur":2,"text":"and

to change one law"},"930":{"dur":3,"text":"because we're the best in the world when it comes to the"},"933":{"dur":3,"text":"civil rights protection of people with disabilities."},"936":{"dur":2,"text":"So we don't have to change anything."},"938":{"dur":6,"text":"So last year, under the guidance of then-Senator John Kerry,"},"944":{"dur":4,"text":"who is now our Secretary of State,"},"949":{"dur":3,"text":"it went to the Foreign Relations Committee and they had hearings."},"953":{"dur":1,"text":"I remember that Senator McCain"},"955":{"dur":4,"text":"and I were the two lead off witnesses."},"959":{"dur":2,"text":"And we brought that treaty to the floor of the Senate in"},"962":{"dur":3,"text":"December, fully expecting that it would pass."},"966":{"dur":1,"text":"And, of course, under the"},"967":{"dur":1,"text":"Constitution of the United States"},"968":{"dur":3,"text":"it requires a two-thirds vote to approve a

we needed."},"981":{"dur":1,"text":"So we had a number of Republicans"},"982":{"dur":1,"text":"and Democrats on the bill."},"984":{"dur":1,"text":"So why did it fail?"},"986":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, towards the end, right before we brought it up,"},"992":{"dur":6,"text":"former Senator Rick Santorum and others began to talk about how"},"998":{"dur":7,"text":"this was going to prevent people from homeschooling their kids."},"1006":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, I thought I knew the treaty."},"1008":{"dur":1,"text":"I had read it, I had looked at it."},"1009":{"dur":3,"text":"I thought did I miss something?"},"1013":{"dur":1,"text":"Is there something in there that I didn't find?"},"1015":{"dur":2,"text":"So I went back to my staff, let's comb through this."},"1017":{"dur":1,"text":"I got a

absolutely nothing."},"1026":{"dur":4,"text":"That charge was just made out of whole cloth somehow."},"1031":{"dur":4,"text":"But I can tell you that at that time in my office calls"},"1036":{"dur":4,"text":"ran fifty to one against adopting"},"1040":{"dur":3,"text":"the treaty on that issue."},"1043":{"dur":7,"text":"So people were misinformed because of a few people like"},"1051":{"dur":3,"text":"Mr. Santorum and others who decided to whip this up,"},"1054":{"dur":3,"text":"for whatever reason, I don't know."},"1058":{"dur":2,"text":"And there was also a lot of
