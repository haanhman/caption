home,"},"275":{"dur":3,"text":"I didn't feel like I was having\nthe conventional college experience."},"278":{"dur":1,"text":"And two - as an Indian,"},"280":{"dur":3,"text":"I wasn't meeting the standard of success\nthat had been dictated for me."},"283":{"dur":1,"text":"I wasn't doing well to become a doctor."},"285":{"dur":3,"text":"But because that was all I knew\nas success, I stuck with it,"},"289":{"dur":4,"text":"and my GPA and my self-esteem\nfailed as a reason."},"293":{"dur":3,"text":"So how did I change this?\nHow did I turn my life around?"},"296":{"dur":4,"text":"Like I said, meditation has been a part\nof my life ever since I can remember."},"301":{"dur":3,"text":"My dad has been practicing\na form of meditation called Raja yoga,"},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"or yoga of the

point;"},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"I tried it a couple times\nat my freshman year of college,"},"321":{"dur":3,"text":"but anything at that point that my parents\nthought would be good for

going through\nsimilar things that I was,"},"345":{"dur":3,"text":"and they hadn't built up the resistance\nto mediation that I had."},"349":{"dur":3,"text":"One of my friends convinced me to go\nto a mediation retreat one weekend."},"352":{"dur":1,"text":"At first, I cribbed, and I fussed,"},"354":{"dur":3,"text":"I wanted to stay in my own little bubble\nof self-pity and misery."},"357":{"dur":1,"text":"But in the end, I am so glad I went,"},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"because it was probably the best thing\nthat could happen to me."},"362":{"dur":1,"text":"So what is meditation?"},"364":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm sure everybody here has a general idea\nin their head of what it is,"},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"but just to give a few more definitions."},"369":{"dur":5,"text":"\"Meditation is an exercise\nthat trains your mind to regulate itself."},"375":{"dur":4,"text":"It's the ability to focus on one thing\ncontinuously without break."},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"If practiced properly and diligently,"},"382":{"dur":3,"text":"it's a consistent reconnection\nwith your true inner self.\""},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"A lot of people brush\nthe concept of meditation aside"},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"because we think, \"How do we function\nwithout our thoughts?\""},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"\"How do we get through our day\nwithout thinking?\""},"394":{"dur":1,"text":"Other thing people don't realize"},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"is just like our bodies\nrequire physical activity"},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"to keep it strong, healthy, and active,"},"400":{"dur":4,"text":"our minds are muscles\nthat also require exercise and regulation"},"405":{"dur":3,"text":"to keep it strong, happy,\nhealthy, and active."},"408":{"dur":3,"text":"A lot of times, people neglect their minds\nbecause they forget this point."},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"If you think meditation is hard,\nyou are absolutely right."},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"It is very difficult\nto get your brain to shut up"},"417":{"dur":2,"text":"for longer five seconds\nand not think about something else."},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"That is another reason\nwhy people don't try it out."},"423":{"dur":2,"text":"The first time I sat down to meditate,"},"425":{"dur":4,"text":"it felt like every single thought I had\never had in my 18 years of existence"},"430":{"dur":3,"text":"decided to come into my head\nat that exact moment."},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"No matter how many times\nI tried to push them away,"},"436":{"dur":3,"text":"ignore my thoughts, or try\nto get into a state of thoughtlessness,"},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"they kept coming back."},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"I thought, \"Why am I doing this?"},"442":{"dur":3,"text":"Another thing in life I am failing at;\nwhy am I even trying?\""},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"The second time I sat down\nto meditate during that retreat,"},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"my thoughts decreased by a quarter."},"452":{"dur":3,"text":"The third time I sat down\nto meditate during that retreat,"},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"they decreased by half."},"456":{"dur":4,"text":"Gradually, it was as though I was starting\nto see the world in High-Definiton."},"461":{"dur":4,"text":"Not only could I see\nmy external circumstances very clearly"},"465":{"dur":3,"text":"but I was finally starting\nto see my true inner self"},"468":{"dur":3,"text":"with the objectivity and clarity\nthat I not had ever before."},"474":{"dur":4,"text":"The practice of meditation\nthat I am a part of prescribes"},"478":{"dur":3,"text":"meditating twice a day\nfor one hour each time."},"482":{"dur":3,"text":"Once in the morning for an hour,\nonce in the evening for an hour."},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"I will be totally honest,\nit took me a very long time"},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"to get to a point\nwhere I was consistent with this."},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"Some days I was doing a really great job."},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"I get up, I meditate,\nI go to bed, and I meditate."},"495":{"dur":3,"text":"Before I went bed\nI would meditate, and I'd be fine."},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"But other days,\nmore bad days than good days,"},"501":{"dur":1,"text":"I would just be downright lazy,"},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"and I would stay up all night\nwatching Ellen videos,"},"505":{"dur":4,"text":"and then wake up late the next morning\ninstead of meditating."},"509":{"dur":1,"text":"My rationale for this was,"},"510":{"dur":3,"text":"\"I'm young, I have the rest of my life\nto work on my meditation practice,"},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't have more time\nto watch Ellen videos.\""},"516":{"dur":0,"text":"(Laughter)"},"517":{"dur":4,"text":"But I think it took me a long time\nto connect with my meditation practice"},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"because I wasn't accustomed\nto the silence that came with meditation."},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"I think. as humans, we thrive on noise"},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"because it makes us feel\nas we're doing something."},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"So I sit to meditate,\nand about 5 to 10 minutes in,"},"533":{"dur":3,"text":"I would realize I was craving noise,\nI needed some sort of distraction."},"537":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'd give up on meditating,"},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"and I immediately reached\nfor my phone or for my laptop."},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"What this taught me was\nI had come to point where I hated silence."},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"This also taught me\nhow loud my world was."},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"Noise is not just sound or cacophony,"},"551":{"dur":3,"text":"noise is the frustration you feel\nwith a family member or a friend."},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"It's writer's block,"},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"it's not understanding\na concept at school."},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"Anything is noise\nif it is loud enough to distract us."},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"When I realized\nthat I'd come to hate silence,"},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"it made me examine my routine;\nI realized I couldn't get through a day"},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"without sound, or noise,\nor distractions of some sort."},"572":{"dur":3,"text":"I would wake up in the morning,\nand I would meditate half-heartedly"},"576":{"dur":1,"text":"before giving up because it got too hard."},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"I would immediately reach\nfor my phone of for my laptop,"},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"and I would play music and videos"},"582":{"dur":3,"text":"while I was getting ready for school\nor while I was eating breakfast."},"585":{"dur":3,"text":"I'd drive to school with music on,\nI'd get to class, I'd be fine;"},"588":{"dur":3,"text":"about halfway through class I'd zone out\nthinking about the video I watched."},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"There would be so much chaos\ncoming around me and in me"},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"because of my thoughts and distractions"},"596":{"dur":1,"text":"that I'd come home\nand feel frustrated,"},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"and let out that frustration\non my family members"},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"not knowing what to do with it."},"602":{"dur":1,"text":"I'd start my homework and feel frustrated"},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"because I wasn't understanding\nthe concepts,"},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"but that's because I had music\non the background."},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"I try to sit down and meditate\nat the end of the day,"},"611":{"dur":3,"text":"and I'd give up again because there was\nso much going on in my head."},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"I get annoyed when I couldn't fall asleep,\nand I get frustrated,"},"618":{"dur":3,"text":"because I felt like I wasn't progressing\nin my meditation practice."},"621":{"dur":4,"text":"What this taught me was in order to create\na true connection with my inner self,"},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"I had to learn how to love silence."},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"In order to learn how to love silence,"},"630":{"dur":4,"text":"I had to really use my willpower\nand commit to my meditation practice."},"634":{"dur":5,"text":"In order to sustain the love for silence\nthat I cultivated internally,"},"639":{"dur":4,"text":"my internal environment had to interact\nwith my external environment."},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"The more and more I meditated,"},"646":{"dur":3,"text":"the more I started to learn\nhow to love silence internally,"},"649":{"dur":3,"text":"the more my internal environment\nbegan to reflect my external environment."},"653":{"dur":3,"text":"That's when I started to see the changes\nin myself that I wanted to see."},"657":{"dur":1,"text":"So here are a few,"},"658":{"dur":4,"text":"\"How meditation creates interaction -\nthe internal with the external.\""},"663":{"dur":1,"text":"Confidence --"},"664":{"dur":2,"text":"like I said earlier,\nI've always lacked in self-confidence,"},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"but creating a consistent reconnection\nwith my inner self"},"670":{"dur":1,"text":"drove that fear of confidence away."},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"Suddenly, I was able to\nstand up for myself,"},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"I was feeling more confident\nwithin myself,"},"676":{"dur":1,"text":"and it gave me the courage"},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"to eventually switch my major\nto International Studies,"},"680":{"dur":1,"text":"and get rid of this idea"},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"that in order to be successful,\nI have to do something big."},"685":{"dur":2,"text":"Replacing the positive\nwith the negative --"},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"like I said before,\nwe may get the job that we want,"},"690":{"dur":3,"text":"but there is always
