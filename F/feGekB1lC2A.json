I think he was about 93.\nAnd this is one hell of a legacy to leave"},"505":{"dur":5,"text":"behind. It's a really amazing creation that\nhim and David Croft put together. So, yeah,"},"511":{"dur":3,"text":"he'll be sadly missed, but he's certainly\nleft some great memories behind that people"},"514":{"dur":5,"text":"will continue to enjoy for many, many years.\nIt really is a true classic of the genre."},"520":{"dur":5,"text":"And Derren Brown, I have a few of his DVDs,\nand that's what I'm gonna finish this part"},"525":{"dur":4,"text":"with.
