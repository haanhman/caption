do."},"369":{"dur":1,"text":"And actually, all three\nof those disciplines"},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"have parts which\ndon't focus on that."},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"So I look at the\nbehavioral

No."},"425":{"dur":0,"text":"MATT BRITTIN: OK."},"426":{"dur":1,"text":"So let's just introduce\nsome of the concepts,"},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"and I think people will be\nfamiliar with some of

approach"},"444":{"dur":1,"text":"to describing the\nway the brain works"},"446":{"dur":3,"text":"is much more the way\nthat neuroscientists now"},"449":{"dur":1,"text":"talk about the\nbrain, rather

right"},"472":{"dur":0,"text":"now."},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's conscious attention."},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"It's conscious reasoning."},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"It's

trying"},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"to be really positive\nin a conversation."},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"It's emotional self-regulation."},"489":{"dur":3,"text":"It is also planning\nand forward thinking."},"493":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's all the grown-up\nstuff, basically."},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"The problem is that it's\nquite limited in capacity."},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"So it can only do\none thing at a time."},"501":{"dur":1,"text":"It's comparatively slow."},"502":{"dur":1,"text":"MATT BRITTIN: Can I check?"},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"So is it true that it can\nonly do one thing at

once,"},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"our deliberate system is\nactually switching attention"},"575":{"dur":0,"text":"from one thing to another."},"576":{"dur":1,"text":"It's doing it so fast,\nyou didn't realize it,"},"578":{"dur":3,"text":"but in those switches, you\nlose time and mental energy."},"582":{"dur":3,"text":"Which is why you actually are\nslower in performing a

were we?"},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"MATT BRITTIN: So we were talking\nabout the two-system brain."},"594":{"dur":0,"text":"CAROLINE WEBB:\nDeliberate system."},"595":{"dur":1,"text":"MATT BRITTIN: I

So\nthe automatic system."},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, it's not just that."},"602":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean, it's the unsung\nhero, because we're not"},"607":{"dur":3,"text":"So by definition, it's
