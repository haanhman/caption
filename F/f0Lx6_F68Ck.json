from Memphis."},"199":{"dur":2,"text":"So it got cold in the winter"},"202":{"dur":1,"text":"and if you had cracks\nin your driveway,"},"203":{"dur":2,"text":"the water would get in\nthere and when it froze,"},"206":{"dur":1,"text":"it expanded those cracks."},"207":{"dur":3,"text":"So I was sealing driveways\nand I was doing anywhere"},"211":{"dur":1,"text":"from eight to 10\ndriveways a

I do year round?"},"220":{"dur":2,"text":"Thought, hm, it gets cool, hot,"},"223":{"dur":1,"text":"heating and air\nconditioning, right?"},"225":{"dur":2,"text":"So I started a heating and\nair

even going to the\nheating and air conditioning,"},"242":{"dur":2,"text":"the way you went about your\nbusiness model was very unique."},"244":{"dur":2,"text":"Where you would call a new\nhomeowner and you would say,"},"247":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Hey congratulations, for\nfree, we wanna come out.\""},"249":{"dur":2,"text":"So talk a little of\njust kinda your mantra,"},"252":{"dur":1,"text":"it's really interesting"},"253":{"dur":1,"text":"just in terms of\nthe customer service"},"254":{"dur":1,"text":"but the direct connect,"},"256":{"dur":0,"text":"the relationship."},"257":{"dur":2,"text":"- So I always believed,"},"259":{"dur":2,"text":"you just don't open the\ndoors of your business"},"261":{"dur":2,"text":"and wait for people to come."},"264":{"dur":1,"text":"It's like, build\nand they will come?"},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"No, you havta build\nit and then market it"},"268":{"dur":1,"text":"and they will come."},"269":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, so when I was\ndoing driveway sealing,"},"272":{"dur":1,"text":"I was knocking on doors."},"273":{"dur":1,"text":"When I started heating\nand air conditioning,"},"274":{"dur":4,"text":"this was brilliant advice\nI got from my father,"},"279":{"dur":3,"text":"go get all the new homeowners\nthat just bought a house."},"282":{"dur":3,"text":"And there's a public record\nof that in Cincinnati,"},"285":{"dur":1,"text":"and maybe here in Memphis also."},"287":{"dur":1,"text":"But I got this list."},"288":{"dur":1,"text":"Every new homeowner,"},"290":{"dur":1,"text":"it was of public record,"},"291":{"dur":1,"text":"and so we'd get\ntheir phone number"},"293":{"dur":2,"text":"through cross\nchecking and whatever."},"295":{"dur":1,"text":"We'd call them and\ncongratulate them"},"297":{"dur":1,"text":"on the purchase of the new home."},"299":{"dur":2,"text":"And say as a welcome\ngift to the neighborhood,"},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"please don't fire\nup that furnace"},"303":{"dur":1,"text":"until you get a safety check."},"305":{"dur":2,"text":"And, you know, it's\na dangerous you know,"},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"carbon monoxide and all\nthat kind of stuff, right?"},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"So, most of them,\noh this is amazing,"},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"free safety check."},"314":{"dur":1,"text":"We'd send out our technician,"},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"and we'd clean the\nfurnace free of charge."},"317":{"dur":1,"text":"Check for safety,"},"319":{"dur":1,"text":"check for connections,"},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"and clean it all free of charge,"},"323":{"dur":1,"text":"but right then and there,"},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"we also had an opportunity\nto offer them something."},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"A humidifier, electro\nstatic air cleaner,"},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"maybe a new more\nefficient furnace."},"332":{"dur":1,"text":"And by the way, very few of them"},"334":{"dur":1,"text":"had central air conditioning."},"335":{"dur":1,"text":"They just bought a new house"},"337":{"dur":1,"text":"and they're gonna\nbe sweating through,"},"338":{"dur":3,"text":"it gets very hot in Cincinnati,\nOhio in the summer, right?"},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"So all of a sudden,\nI got a business,"},"344":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to college every day,"},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm installing 10\nsystems a week,"},"348":{"dur":1,"text":"and we were off to the races."},"350":{"dur":1,"text":"First year a million,"},"351":{"dur":1,"text":"second year two\nmillion in sales."},"353":{"dur":1,"text":"So it was an amazing business."},"354":{"dur":1,"text":"- And all this in college,"},"355":{"dur":1,"text":"while you're a\ncollege student too."},"357":{"dur":1,"text":"So burning the\ncandle at all ends."},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, what really led\nto the next chapter is,"},"361":{"dur":1,"text":"you go to sell that business"},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"and you see, wait a second."},"365":{"dur":2,"text":"You're looking at all\nof these opportunities"},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"kinda laid out."},"368":{"dur":1,"text":"Talk about launching\nthe next phase."},"370":{"dur":1,"text":"- So I realized,"},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"the heating and air\nconditioning business"},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"was very labor intensive."},"376":{"dur":3,"text":"I was a good salesman but we\ncouldn't get good installers."},"380":{"dur":4,"text":"To install 10 systems a\nweek, required a team."},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"We had six trucks, six crews,"},"386":{"dur":1,"text":"but I'd say to be\nhonest with you,"},"388":{"dur":1,"text":"three good crews and three,"},"390":{"dur":3,"text":"ya know, half way\ngood crews, right?"},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we were getting a\nlot of service problems"},"395":{"dur":1,"text":"and installation issues"},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"and I just said, you know\nwhat, I don't like this."},"399":{"dur":2,"text":"There was no tech\nschools for these people"},"402":{"dur":1,"text":"and I run an ad for service man"},"404":{"dur":2,"text":"and get zero phone calls, right?"},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"So there was no\nmonster or anything,"},"408":{"dur":1,"text":"this is back in the 70s."},"409":{"dur":1,"text":"So I say I'm out."},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"I can't deal with all of this."},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"I've installed\nsystems for friends"},"416":{"dur":1,"text":"and they would have issues."},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"I wasn't proud of my business."},"422":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'm sitting at a\nbusiness brokerage company"},"427":{"dur":1,"text":"that was gonna sell my business."},"428":{"dur":3,"text":"And he had stacks of\nbusinesses for sale"},"432":{"dur":1,"text":"and I was like, this is,"},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"you've got laundromats,\npizza parlors,"},"435":{"dur":1,"text":"delicatessens, flower shops,"},"436":{"dur":1,"text":"all these different\ncompanies for sale."},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'm going through\nthem one by one."},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm looking at the percentage"},"442":{"dur":1,"text":"of food cost in the restaurants,"},"444":{"dur":1,"text":"and the rent percentages,"},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"the lease agreements\nwith the malls."},"447":{"dur":0,"text":"And I'm like wow,"},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"this like a kid in a candy store"},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"full of entrepreneurship, right?"},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I said, I'm\ngonna sell my company"},"454":{"dur":1,"text":"and this is what I wanna do."},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"So I did,"},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"and funny thing was, I\ngot back from that meeting"},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"and one of my employees said,"},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"\"I heard you're interested\nin selling your company,"},"463":{"dur":1,"text":"\"I'm gonna buy it.\""},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"I didn't have to pay a\ncommission or anything,"},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"so I then became\na business broker."},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"I got a license and got\nthe real estate test"},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"and all that for the state."},"474":{"dur":1,"text":"So we were a real estate broker,"},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"real estate licensed office,"},"478":{"dur":1,"text":"and we sold the business also."},"480":{"dur":1,"text":"So we started getting listings"},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"and all of a sudden,\nI had 200 listings."},"484":{"dur":1,"text":"I had 14 employees."},"485":{"dur":1,"text":"And we said,"},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"I'd be sitting at\nthe closing table,"},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's sign here,"},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"you now own that restaurant."},"493":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'd say, \"Now where are\nyou gonna get your insurance?\""},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"And where you gonna, you know."},"496":{"dur":1,"text":"Oh, insurance."},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah, I do need insurance\nfor that restaurant, don't I?"},"499":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, what about\nyour bookkeeping?"},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"What about, you need a new\nmenu design, don't cha?"},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, I'm givin' 'em the\nname of the graphic artist,"},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"and an insurance company,\na bookkeeper, all of this."},"509":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'm like, \"Wait a minute.\""},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not getting paid\nfor any of that,"},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"why don't I bring it all"},"513":{"dur":1,"text":"under one roof.\n- One house."},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"- So I said, I rented a whole\nfloor of an office building"},"517":{"dur":1,"text":"in downtown Cincinnati."},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"And I leased an office to a\nlawyer, an insurance agent,"},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"to a graphic guy, and an\nadvertising agency, et cetera."},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"And we were the small\nbusiness center."},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"A one stop center\nfor small businesses."},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"We sold ya the business,"},"531":{"dur":1,"text":"we incorporated you,"},"532":{"dur":1,"text":"we did your books and records,"},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"we did your,\nwhatever you needed."},"535":{"dur":1,"text":"You didn't have to,\nyou know, by the way,"},"537":{"dur":1,"text":"if you had everything already,"},"538":{"dur":1,"text":"you didn't need us at all."},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"But very few people\ndidn't want something."},"542":{"dur":2,"text":"So this then gave, in fact,"},"544":{"dur":2,"text":"what would happen a year later,"},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"they want to sell\nthe business again"},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"because they didn't\nlike it, you know,"},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"or maybe the husband\nbought it for the wife,"},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"she got tired of having\nto work 60 hours a week."},"554":{"dur":1,"text":"Being an entrepreneur\nis not so easy."},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"So we had a really good time."},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"For me, I started to invest\nin some of these businesses."},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'd sell something,"},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"and I'd say, \"Well\nthis is pretty cool.\""},"569":{"dur":1,"text":"We were doing franchises also."},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"So I would get franchise rights,"},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"I would get this,"},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"and this is when I started"},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"kinda my wheelin'\nand dealin' phases."},"577":{"dur":4,"text":"And this actually led me to\nthe informercial business,"},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"which we can talk about."},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yeah that's the big\naha moment for you,"},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"is the informercial."},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"But go ahead and\nshare your story"},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"because it starts\nwith some bars on a TV"},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"and seeing that wait a second,\nthere's an opportunity."},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"But really your at a trade show,"},"595":{"dur":1,"text":"so start there."},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"- So you gotta put\nyourself back in the,"},"599":{"dur":1,"text":"this is 1984 now,"},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"so I'm dating myself\na little bit here."},"603":{"dur":0,"text":"But TV,"},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"when I first got\ncable television,"},"608":{"dur":3,"text":"before that, I remember\nblack and white TV,"},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"and then we got color TV."},"614":{"dur":0,"text":"I said, \"What's cable?\""},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"Oh, it's gonna be 30 channels."},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"I only had five."},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox\nand one independent,"},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"one public broadcasting."},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"So all of a sudden,\nthey're

Discovery?\""},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's when\nthe aha moment hit."},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm gonna put\nsomething on that time"},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"that will generate

hours."},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's when I started\nputting products up"},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's sort of a funny story,"},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"'cause I used to go to\nall these trade shows"},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"and I met a guy\nat the trade show,"},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"the Philadelphia Home\nShow at the time."},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"And he was selling a knife

Cincinnati,"},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"which we did."},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I said, \"Well let me\ngo the national Discovery.\""},"725":{"dur":1,"text":"And I went to national Discovery"},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"and I got a six\nhour a day block,"},"728":{"dur":1,"text":"on Discovery nationwide."},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"'Cause I started putting\nmore and more products up."},"733":{"dur":1,"text":"So we were putting up,"},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"knife sets and fitness\nproducts with Tony Little"},"738":{"dur":1,"text":"and juicers with Jack LaLanne."},"740":{"dur":1,"text":"And all of a sudden,"},"741":{"dur":1,"text":"I had a hundred infomercials"},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"and that was the\nbeginning of the business."},"745":{"dur":0,"text":"- And not just\nhere in the states,"},"746":{"dur":1,"text":"but all around the world."},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"- We found out that if there's\nbars on the screen in the US,"},"749":{"dur":1,"text":"see what happened was,"},"751":{"dur":3,"text":"Discovery was only an\n18 hour a day network"},"755":{"dur":2,"text":"because they didn't have\nenough budget to

they just said, \"Look,\nwhy continue to run them"},"767":{"dur":1,"text":"\"over and over and over.\""},"768":{"dur":2,"text":"In hindsight, they probably\nshoulda just kept running"},"771":{"dur":1,"text":"them for 24 hours."},"772":{"dur":2,"text":"But they just decided to\nonly program 18 hours."},"774":{"dur":1,"text":"They thought it was\nlittle too

that."},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"But when we went to England,\nwhen we went to Germany,"},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"when we went to Saudi Arabia,\nwhen we went to Latin
