{"0":{"dur":1,"text":"[MUSIC PLAYING]"},"14":{"dur":2,"text":"Dr. Darmstadt, thank you so\nmuch for joining me here today."},"17":{"dur":0,"text":"My pleasure."},"18":{"dur":1,"text":"I was really excited to\ntalk to you because you"},"19":{"dur":2,"text":"have a tremendous global health\nbackground, including the Gates"},"22":{"dur":1,"text":"Foundation and others."},"23":{"dur":2,"text":"And I wanted to ask,\nwhat do you think"},"26":{"dur":2,"text":"the most pressing issues\nare facing children's"},"28":{"dur":1,"text":"health worldwide today?"},"30":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, one of the things that\nI've been focusing a lot on"},"33":{"dur":1,"text":"is newborn health."},"34":{"dur":1,"text":"If you look at the\nprogress that we've"},"36":{"dur":5,"text":"had in child health over the\nlast, say, two, three decades,"},"42":{"dur":2,"text":"we've seen child\nmortality coming down,"},"44":{"dur":3,"text":"but the neonatal portion of\nit coming down less slowly."},"47":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's becoming a greater\nand greater proportion"},"50":{"dur":2,"text":"of the under-5 deaths that are\noccurring around the world."},"52":{"dur":2,"text":"In many places of the\nworld, it's now over half."},"55":{"dur":2,"text":"You total it all up,\nand it's like 44%."},"58":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we're seeing\nthat the solutions that"},"61":{"dur":3,"text":"work for older children\ndon't necessarily"},"65":{"dur":2,"text":"do all the job for\nnewborns and that we"},"67":{"dur":2,"text":"need particular interventions."},"69":{"dur":2,"text":"And it very much links\ninto maternal health."},"72":{"dur":3,"text":"You cannot separate the\nchild from the mother,"},"75":{"dur":2,"text":"particularly early\naround the time of birth."},"78":{"dur":3,"text":"And so much of what helps\nthe newborn actually"},"82":{"dur":2,"text":"also helps the mother."},"85":{"dur":2,"text":"And so many of the\ninterventions also"},"87":{"dur":2,"text":"help the development\nof that child."},"90":{"dur":2,"text":"And so it becomes\nan important way"},"92":{"dur":1,"text":"of setting that\nchild on a trajectory"},"94":{"dur":2,"text":"for the rest of\ntheir life that will"},"96":{"dur":5,"text":"lead to them being productive\nand having well-being."},"102":{"dur":2,"text":"Just that period of time\nis just so critical."},"105":{"dur":1,"text":"So really important to\nfocus our interventions"},"107":{"dur":1,"text":"on that kind of neonatal period."},"108":{"dur":0,"text":"Yes."},"109":{"dur":2,"text":"Particularly the period right\naround the time of birth"},"111":{"dur":3,"text":"is just super-important\nfor saving maternal lives,"},"115":{"dur":1,"text":"for saving the\nlives of newborns,"},"116":{"dur":2,"text":"and, again, optimizing\ntheir chances"},"119":{"dur":1,"text":"for a healthy, productive life."},"121":{"dur":1,"text":"You mentioned a really\ninteresting concept,"},"123":{"dur":2,"text":"this idea of inculturating\nmedicine or science."},"125":{"dur":1,"text":"Can you tell me a little\nbit more about that"},"127":{"dur":2,"text":"and how it relates to\nthe work that you do?"},"129":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, it's really the\nidea-- I try to make"},"131":{"dur":2,"text":"the point that we know a lot."},"134":{"dur":2,"text":"We have a lot of\nmedical knowledge"},"137":{"dur":3,"text":"that we can apply to\ndeveloping countries."},"141":{"dur":1,"text":"But so many of\nthose interventions"},"142":{"dur":2,"text":"are kind of piling up because\nwe haven't really quite figured"},"145":{"dur":2,"text":"out yet how to\neffectively deliver them."},"148":{"dur":1,"text":"There are a number\nof factors that"},"149":{"dur":4,"text":"go into effectively putting\ninto the hands of the people"},"154":{"dur":2,"text":"these medical advances."},"157":{"dur":2,"text":"And the point that\nI was trying to make"},"159":{"dur":5,"text":"is that in order for people\nin poor parts of the world"},"164":{"dur":4,"text":"to embrace new technologies\nand even to change behaviors,"},"169":{"dur":3,"text":"we have to understand\nwhere they're coming from."},"172":{"dur":3,"text":"And we have to really kind of\nmeet them where they're at."},"176":{"dur":4,"text":"And there's science around\ndeveloping that understanding"},"180":{"dur":4,"text":"and then using that\nknowledge of their worldview,"},"184":{"dur":3,"text":"the way that they learn, the\nway that they communicate"},"188":{"dur":5,"text":"and transmit information,\nthe networks that they have"},"193":{"dur":2,"text":"and the pathways of\ninfluence, all of that's"},"196":{"dur":3,"text":"extremely important in figuring\nout how you introduce something"},"199":{"dur":2,"text":"in a way that they want it\nand that they'll adopt it"},"202":{"dur":0,"text":"and take it."},"203":{"dur":2,"text":"Because that's the only way that\nall these incredible advances"},"205":{"dur":3,"text":"in science can actually end up\nmaking a difference, is people"},"209":{"dur":2,"text":"take it up and do\nsomething with it."},"211":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a very interesting\npoint, because at a conference"},"214":{"dur":3,"text":"like ChildX, we hear a lot of\nreally fascinating innovations,"},"217":{"dur":1,"text":"some of them highly technical."},"219":{"dur":2,"text":"Do you think that these\ninnovations could eventually"},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"be translated to the\ndeveloping world?"},"224":{"dur":3,"text":"Or do we have kind of bigger\nfish to fry in that arena?"},"227":{"dur":0,"text":"No."},"228":{"dur":3,"text":"I think that we need both."},"232":{"dur":2,"text":"We need to continue\nto advancing science."},"234":{"dur":4,"text":"Because let's take preterm\nbirth as an example."},"239":{"dur":2,"text":"Preterm birth has become\nnow the number one"},"241":{"dur":3,"text":"cause of death in children\nbefore their fifth birthday."},"244":{"dur":3,"text":"This year, it crossed\nover, beating on pneumonia"},"248":{"dur":2,"text":"for the first time."},"250":{"dur":3,"text":"Preterm birth is something\nthat we do have interventions"},"253":{"dur":3,"text":"that, once you're born\npreterm, can help you."},"257":{"dur":4,"text":"But the more preterm you become,\nthe less those kinds of things"},"261":{"dur":3,"text":"help you, and the greater\nyour risk of death."},"264":{"dur":1,"text":"And so we really\nneed to get down"},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"to preventing preterm birth."},"268":{"dur":1,"text":"Now there, we're really bad."},"270":{"dur":2,"text":"And the only way\nthat we're really"},"272":{"dur":3,"text":"going to advance our ability\nto prevent preterm birth"},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"is by advancing the science."},"278":{"dur":3,"text":"That's just one example of\nwhere, in global health,"},"282":{"dur":1,"text":"the big impediment\nthere is really"},"284":{"dur":3,"text":"our scientific\nunderstanding of what"},"287":{"dur":3,"text":"is preterm birth about, what\nfundamentally is causing it,"},"290":{"dur":2,"text":"so that then we can begin to\nfigure out how do you intervene"},"293":{"dur":1,"text":"to prevent that from happening."},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"Shifting gears a little bit, you\nactually have a new role here"},"298":{"dur":1,"text":"Can you tell me a\nlittle bit about what"},"300":{"dur":2,"text":"you're going to be doing and\nwhat your hopes are for that?"},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, I'm super-excited\nto be here."},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"I've been here just a month."},"307":{"dur":1,"text":"Came from the Gates Foundation."},"309":{"dur":3,"text":"And what I'm going\nto be doing is--"},"312":{"dur":3,"text":"one of the things that\nattracted me here to Stanford"},"316":{"dur":5,"text":"is that I think it's a unique\nenvironment where people really"},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"want to come around\nbig problems,"},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"and they want to come\naround it together."},"325":{"dur":4,"text":"And they want to\nwork with people"},"330":{"dur":3,"text":"from a whole variety of\ndisciplines and perspectives."},"334":{"dur":1,"text":"And I really firmly\nbelieve that that's"},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"where advances are going to\nbe made, by people coming"},"338":{"dur":3,"text":"together who might not\notherwise be thinking"},"342":{"dur":4,"text":"about a particular problem,\nlike preterm birth, for example."},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"There are so many different\nways that you can bring science"},"349":{"dur":3,"text":"to bear on that problem that\nhasn't really been effectively"},"352":{"dur":0,"text":"done yet."},"353":{"dur":1,"text":"So that was the\nkind of environment"},"354":{"dur":1,"text":"that really attracted me here."},"356":{"dur":3,"text":"So what I'm aiming\nto do is to really"},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"help build the programs in\nglobal women and children"},"362":{"dur":0,"text":"health."},"363":{"dur":3,"text":"One of the things that I'm\nalso really passionate about it"},"366":{"dur":4,"text":"is issues of gender and\nissues of gender equality,"},"371":{"dur":3,"text":"because I think so much\nof what's holding us back"},"374":{"dur":4,"text":"in terms of development progress\nis the low status of women"},"378":{"dur":2,"text":"and the lack of empowerment\nthat women have."},"381":{"dur":1,"text":"We know that when\nyou put resources"},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"in the hands of women,\nthey tend more often"},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"to direct those resources to\nchildren and for the betterment"},"388":{"dur":0,"text":"of their family."},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's another thing\nthat I'm aiming to do here,"},"392":{"dur":1,"text":"is to really bring\nmore attention to that."},"394":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, Stanford is certainly\nlucky to have you."},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm very much looking forward\nto seeing what you bring."},"398":{"dur":0,"text":"Thank you very
