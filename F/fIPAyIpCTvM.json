there's"},"2559":{"dur":3,"text":"concessional loans, there's public-private\npartnerships, and private sector."},"2562":{"dur":4,"text":"So we think that altogether we can\nfind the trillions of

loans."},"2667":{"dur":3,"text":"And the loans are based\non sovereign guarantees."},"2670":{"dur":2,"text":"In other words,\nthe country themselves guarantee the loan."},"2673":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's very hard to do that with\nmultiple NGOs, but even though it's hard,"},"2677":{"dur":2,"text":"So we have something called\na global program for"},"2680":{"dur":3,"text":"social accountability, where we\nstarted with a small amount of money,"},"2684":{"dur":3,"text":"20 million, the Ford Foundation,\nthe Source Foundation put money in."},"2688":{"dur":2,"text":"And we're beginning to

government can now make\ntheir own decisions about whether"},"2700":{"dur":3,"text":"they utilize NGO's, or the private\nsector to provide the services."},"2704":{"dur":5,"text":"So at that point, because it's\nbased on a sovereign guarantee,"},"2709":{"dur":4,"text":"we have to go through governments for\nthe public sector side."},"2713":{"dur":2,"text":"We also have a huge private\nsector practice where we"},"2716":{"dur":4,"text":"make loans to companies that want to\nwork in developing countries, but"},"2721":{"dur":3,"text":"also we take equity positions\nin those companies as

takeaways\nthat I had from that was that"},"2783":{"dur":2,"text":"a grassroots approach is really important."},"2785":{"dur":4,"text":"And secondary, that the approach that you\ngo into one community with cannot just be"},"2790":{"dur":2,"text":"taken and applied to another community."},"2792":{"dur":5,"text":"So I'm wondering with your work at\nthe World Bank, which is very top-down and"},"2798":{"dur":4,"text":"kind of tried to take economic policies\nand applied them across developing"},"2803":{"dur":4,"text":"countries, how have you been able\nto reconcile these points of

question."},"2816":{"dur":4,"text":"I have to tell you that if\nyou were to say to me that"},"2820":{"dur":5,"text":"our biggest impact has been on things\nlike multidrug-resistant TB and"},"2826":{"dur":3,"text":"HIV, because we changed, fundamentally,\nthe way people thought about it."},"2830":{"dur":5,"text":"And none of those ideas came to us,\nnecessarily, from the

antibiotics."},"2841":{"dur":1,"text":"That's not how they think\nabout those things."},"2842":{"dur":5,"text":"And so, for me, the most fundamental\ntakeaway from Partners in Health"},"2847":{"dur":4,"text":"is that we started with a very\nclear ethical, moral principle,"},"2852":{"dur":4,"text":"which was to make a preferential\noption for the poor."},"2857":{"dur":4,"text":"And then from there, we said, so, given\nthat our goal is to make a preferential"},"2862":{"dur":3,"text":"option for the poor, what is it that\nwe should be doing as medical doctors,"},"2866":{"dur":3,"text":"as people who live in wealthy countries?"},"2869":{"dur":2,"text":"And the conclusions were\nkind of unexpected, right?"},"2871":{"dur":3,"text":"And I know what you're saying, and\nmany people come to us and say well,"},"2875":{"dur":3,"text":"you should only do what the people want\nyou to do in a particular community."},"2879":{"dur":4,"text":"But I've worked in so many communities,\nand sometimes the people in those"},"2883":{"dur":4,"text":"communities can see exactly what they\nwant, and then that's what you do."},"2887":{"dur":3,"text":"But I think what we've done is to say,\nokay, we can't do everything."},"2891":{"dur":3,"text":"We're not going to do a feeding\nprogram everywhere we go."},"2894":{"dur":3,"text":"What we'll do,\nis try to

that process of engagement\nhappens, you come together to a conclusion"},"2906":{"dur":3,"text":"about what is to be done, which is exactly\nwhat we do at the World Bank Group."},"2909":{"dur":4,"text":"We do our own analysis of what any country\nneeds to do in order to grow its economy,"},"2914":{"dur":4,"text":"invest in its people, ensure that poor\npeople don't fall back into poverty."},"2918":{"dur":3,"text":"But then, once we do our analysis,\nwe take it the country themselves."},"2921":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's usually Ministers of Finance and\nothers and say, and"},"2924":{"dur":3,"text":"also civil society now participates\nmuch more than before."},"2928":{"dur":2,"text":"What is it you think your priorities are?"},"2930":{"dur":3,"text":"And then if we can come to an agreement,\nthen we go forward."},"2933":{"dur":3,"text":"So I've heard this before,\nyou're top down and we're."},"2937":{"dur":4,"text":"Let me just put it this way."},"2943":{"dur":5,"text":"I don't think my philosophy, the notion\nof a preferential option for the poor"},"2948":{"dur":4,"text":"has changed one bit since I worked in\nthe slums of Lima and in

preferential option for"},"2969":{"dur":4,"text":"the poor, which is the foundation of\neverything we did at Partners in Health."},"2973":{"dur":4,"text":"So the World Bank Group,\nthis great huge institution, endorsed this"},"2978":{"dur":4,"text":"notion of a preferential option for\nthe poor eight months after I took over."},"2982":{"dur":3,"text":"So now, everything we do I can go back
