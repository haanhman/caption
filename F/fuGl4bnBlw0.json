We're going to talk about how we can create"},"45":{"dur":4,"text":"online presences with no trade-offs at all and what's the best way to organize ourselves"},"50":{"dur":6,"text":"to get it done. But first, I'd like to tell you about these glasses I'm wearing. These glasses"},"56":{"dur":4,"text":"are part of a kit that's designed by a friend of mine, George Zimmerman. He's a doctor"},"61":{"dur":5,"text":"in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. To think about disabilities we tend to think about extreme disability:"},"66":{"dur":3,"text":"someone who has been blind since birth. Someone who can't hear at all. But in fact"},"70":{"dur":5,"text":"the vast majority of disabilities actually are more subtle and perhaps more temporary."},"76":{"dur":5,"text":"Now on my left eye I'm wearing a lens which limits my vision to about 3 degrees."},"82":{"dur":5,"text":"On my right eye more of a... this is a 20\/200 lens that kind of gives me a Trailer Park Boys"},"87":{"dur":4,"text":"Coke bottle glasses kind of experience of the world. With this kit George's made it possible"},"92":{"dur":6,"text":"for people with more typical sight to simulate all sorts of challenges. Here's my tiger;"},"99":{"dur":5,"text":"she's wearing, for instance, a lens on her left eye that simulates cataracts and on the right eye"},"104":{"dur":7,"text":"she's also limiting her eyesight to more of a 10 degree view. You'll see more of her later."},"111":{"dur":6,"text":"Now before we get into this though, I'd like to examine why we should care about accessibility."},"117":{"dur":5,"text":"Surely we all think of course, you know we want to have a loving society"},"123":{"dur":5,"text":"where we don't leave anyone behind. But in fact I see five clear reasons why"},"128":{"dur":6,"text":"there's never been a better time for us to care about online accessibility. The first reason is"},"135":{"dur":5,"text":"that there's simply so many of us. On our planet today there's perhaps seven billion people."},"140":{"dur":5,"text":"And people make various estimates of how many people have disabilities: substantial disabilities."},"145":{"dur":5,"text":"Some say 15 percent... 20 percent ...25 percent. Even with the lowest of those numbers,"},"150":{"dur":5,"text":"with seven billion people, we're looking at leaving perhaps a billion people out."},"156":{"dur":5,"text":"Now you and I are both on the Internet right now. But yet for seventy percent"},"162":{"dur":5,"text":"of humanity today the Internet remains a rumour as Nicholas Negroponte reminds us."},"168":{"dur":4,"text":"But this is the decade where that all changes. By the end of this decade the majority of humanity"},"172":{"dur":5,"text":"will be online. We'll all be online together. And we have the opportunity then to liberate"},"178":{"dur":6,"text":"millions upon millions of people, if we can create an Internet where we leave no one behind."},"184":{"dur":6,"text":"The second opportunity regards search engines. Because although we're talking about"},"190":{"dur":4,"text":"billions of human beings in fact the most frequent visitors to most of our public facing websites"},"195":{"dur":5,"text":"aren't human at all. They're machines such as search engine robots. And whether its Google"},"201":{"dur":6,"text":"or Yahoo or Bing, the Google search engine robot has severe disabilities. It can't see,"},"207":{"dur":5,"text":"it can't hear. It's got the cognitive abilities perhaps of a four-and-a-half year old"},"212":{"dur":6,"text":"and yet the majority of online searches where people are looking to buy a product"},"219":{"dur":6,"text":"begin with the search. So if we want great SEO if we want high search rankings, that also starts"},"225":{"dur":7,"text":"with creating accessible web presences. The third reason is about human resources."},"234":{"dur":4,"text":"It's about our colleagues. It's about making sure that even in our workplaces no one gets left behind."},"238":{"dur":6,"text":"If we want to attract and retain the best people available we don't want to lose out"},"244":{"dur":5,"text":"on perhaps 25 percent or more of the potential people that could be working in our organization."},"250":{"dur":4,"text":"We want everyone to be able to collaborate in way that's effective. And so we want our presence"},"254":{"dur":7,"text":"to be accessible as well. The fourth reason: the social responsibility argument."},"261":{"dur":5,"text":"Certainly...especially as Canadians we're we're known for demonstrating how one can create"},"267":{"dur":6,"text":"a civilization where we measure our success by how we treat those who either are"},"274":{"dur":4,"text":"permanently or temporarily our weakest. And certainly then there's a lot of the love"},"279":{"dur":4,"text":"in making sure that we leave no one behind. But the fifth reason and perhaps this is the reason"},"284":{"dur":7,"text":"that compels us to be dwelling on this today is a regulatory reason. More and more"},"291":{"dur":6,"text":"jurisdictions around the world are passing laws and regulations saying you must make sure"},"298":{"dur":6,"text":"your website maintains a minimum level of standards about web accessibility,"},"305":{"dur":7,"text":"document accessibility, PDF accessibility. Whether you're in a region where laws have been passed,"},"312":{"dur":4,"text":"where litigation is becoming more popular, it's good business sense to keep ahead of"},"317":{"dur":6,"text":"web accessibility. Now here in Ontario, I'm proud to say we live in a country where \n54\n00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:30,259\nat a federal level there's a history of leadership Our federal government has been a leader"},"331":{"dur":6,"text":"in web accessibility since the 1990s. And a court decision in 2010 compelled us to up our game."},"338":{"dur":5,"text":"And right here in Ontario, Ontario is the first place in the world where not just government"},"343":{"dur":6,"text":"but any organization -- private sector, nonprofits, anyone with at least fifty employees is required"},"350":{"dur":7,"text":"by law to have a public-facing web presence which exceeds a certain minimum level of accessibility."},"357":{"dur":5,"text":"A very well defined level. And it's an exciting time to be alive. And in fact if you're"},"362":{"dur":4,"text":"if you're here in Ontario, were finding that the tools and the techniques that are being developed"},"366":{"dur":4,"text":"here are being used around the world. I had the privilege of working with"},"371":{"dur":5,"text":"the World Wide Web Foundation this past year on this year's Web index. I'm not sure if you ever"},"377":{"dur":6,"text":"check it out: webindex.org. This is an annual benchmark program, where we compare"},"384":{"dur":5,"text":"how different countries are doing in terms of various aspects of making the web a better place."},"389":{"dur":7,"text":"And one aspect of this is web accessibility. And my job was to audit dozens of countries' results"},"396":{"dur":5,"text":"as to how they were doing in terms of their banks, their telecommunications companies,"},"402":{"dur":4,"text":"their governments at how they're doing with web accessibility. I'm very proud to see"},"406":{"dur":5,"text":"that Canada year-over-year always is in the top five of dozens of countries. But I even found"},"411":{"dur":7,"text":"legislation that was pointing back to actually naming Canadian standards as the one to follow."},"419":{"dur":7,"text":"So we have found the perfect time: we live in a time when we can take the skills"},"426":{"dur":6,"text":"and the techniques and this movement in our society to embrace web accessibility. I find it's similar"},"433":{"dur":5,"text":"to how ten years ago, if I suggested to you there would be a recycle bin in every room"},"438":{"dur":3,"text":"in a government office, you'd say it's crazy. Yet in 10 years time we've seen"},"441":{"dur":5,"text":"this whole shift towards green. Well this is the decade we shift towards accessibility."},"447":{"dur":3,"text":"This is the decade we do better business... we do better civilization..."},"450":{"dur":4,"text":"by all learning how to create a more accessible web."},"455":{"dur":4,"text":">> NARRATOR: Appointed a high-level advisor to the UN, David Berman"},"459":{"dur":5,"text":"has traveled to over 50 countries, inspiring professionals on how we can design"},"464":{"dur":4,"text":"a better civilization.
