do\nyou want to talk about it?"},"1343":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, yeah, when I read\nit, I couldn't really-- I've"},"1346":{"dur":1,"text":"had to read it two times."},"1347":{"dur":2,"text":"You know,

along I sat\nthere thinking, well,"},"1382":{"dur":2,"text":"what's going to\nhappen when Rix goes?"},"1384":{"dur":1,"text":"And finally it was his turn."},"1385":{"dur":1,"text":"And everyone turned to him."},"1386":{"dur":5,"text":"And he had his pants\nwere sagging down."},"1391":{"dur":2,"text":"And he sort of\nsaid with a smile,"},"1394":{"dur":3,"text":"he was like, well, I guess\nI'm supposed to go now, huh?"},"1398":{"dur":2,"text":"And he stood up, and he\nsort of tucked his hat"},"1400":{"dur":2,"text":"low over his eyes so we\ncouldn't really see his face."},"1403":{"dur":4,"text":"And he went up there and he\npulled out a rubber band."},"1407":{"dur":3,"text":"And he said, so I'm going\nto explain something"},"1411":{"dur":3,"text":"to you called a Mobius strip."},"1414":{"dur":2,"text":"And if I was surprised\nto hear the term Mobius"},"1417":{"dur":5,"text":"strip coming out of Rix's mouth,\nI only had to wait and listen."},"1422":{"dur":5,"text":"Because for the next 40\nminutes he began to talk."},"1427":{"dur":3,"text":"And he said, so you can use\nthis rubber band to understand,"},"1431":{"dur":1,"text":"you know, and he and\nhe launched into it."},"1433":{"dur":2,"text":"And you could have\nheard a pin drop."},"1436":{"dur":3,"text":"We barely moved in\nthat whole time."},"1440":{"dur":2,"text":"And he finally explained\nabout the big bang."},"1443":{"dur":4,"text":"And then he tried to\nexplain the difference"},"1447":{"dur":2,"text":"between finite and\ninfinite universes."},"1449":{"dur":3,"text":"And he said, that part's\nreal hard to explain."},"1452":{"dur":2,"text":"I tried to explain to\nmy brother yesterday,"},"1455":{"dur":1,"text":"and he didn't really get it."},"1456":{"dur":3,"text":"So I don't really\neven get it anymore."},"1460":{"dur":3,"text":"Or yeah, like so this\nmight not make any sense,"},"1463":{"dur":5,"text":"but there's this hotel, and it's\nkind of like an infinite hotel."},"1469":{"dur":2,"text":"And I don't know who started\nit, but pretty soon we"},"1472":{"dur":2,"text":"were all clapping."},"1474":{"dur":4,"text":"And, you know, Rix\nwas embarrassed,"},"1478":{"dur":1,"text":"but he was smiling."},"1480":{"dur":2,"text":"SUSAN ENGEL: So when Sam\nwould come home from

again,"},"1546":{"dur":4,"text":"of a kid who didn't seem\nlike academic material."},"1550":{"dur":3,"text":"He wasn't appealing to grownups."},"1553":{"dur":2,"text":"I knew, as I found out\nlater,

dropped"},"1562":{"dur":3,"text":"So he never expected\nto like school."},"1566":{"dur":4,"text":"And he made teachers expect\nthat they wouldn't like him."},"1570":{"dur":3,"text":"He's the kind of
