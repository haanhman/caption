bacteria,"},"43":{"dur":2,"text":"but also viruses and protozoa,"},"46":{"dur":1,"text":"they are part of our normal flora"},"47":{"dur":4,"text":"and they make up what is called\nthe commensal

are many different mechanisms."},"132":{"dur":3,"text":"One way is by activating the vagus nerve."},"135":{"dur":3,"text":"So, the vagus nerve contacts\nthe gut lining"},"139":{"dur":4,"text":"and

the communication deficit\nthat is depicted here."},"257":{"dur":5,"text":"That's a hallmark symptom\nor diagnostic symptom of autism."},"263":{"dur":5,"text":"So, here, mice that are autistic-like\ndisplay less communication,"},"268":{"dur":2,"text":"as depicted by the blue bar,"},"270":{"dur":3,"text":"and treating them with the bug\ncorrects this effect,"},"274":{"dur":3,"text":"as shown by the red bar."},"277":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I think that the implications\nof these discoveries is huge,"},"281":{"dur":3,"text":"because what if we
