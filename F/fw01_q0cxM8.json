the extremes in terms of storms\nand other climate impacts,"},"335":{"dur":4,"text":"is our infrastructure is just not set up\nto deal with these sorts of events."},"340":{"dur":1,"text":"So our roads

also some indirect impacts."},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"So if we take food security, for example."},"385":{"dur":1,"text":"Maize and wheat yields"},"388":{"dur":1,"text":"in some parts of the

this four-degree centigrade scenario"},"409":{"dur":4,"text":"are going to be incompatible\nwith global organized living."},"415":{"dur":3,"text":"So back to our trajectories and our graphs\nof four degrees and two degrees."},"420":{"dur":3,"text":"Is it reasonable still\nto focus on the two-degree path?"},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"There are quite a lot of my colleagues\nand other

numbers"},"449":{"dur":1,"text":"to work out how to do it."},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you focus in on this trajectory\nand these graphs,"},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"the yellow circle there\nhighlights that the departure"},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"from the red four-degree pathway"},"460":{"dur":4,"text":"to the two-degree\ngreen pathway is immediate."},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's because\nof cumulative emissions,"},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"or the carbon budget."},"469":{"dur":3,"text":"So in other words, because\nof the lights and the projectors"},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"that are on in this room right now,"},"475":{"dur":1,"text":"the CO2 that is going into our atmosphere"},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"as a result of that\nelectricity

accumulate, and greenhouse gases\ntend to be cumulative."},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"And that tells us something\nabout these trajectories."},"492":{"dur":4,"text":"First of all, it tells us that it's\nthe area under these curves that matter,"},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"not where we reach\nat a particular date in future."},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's important,\nbecause it doesn't matter"},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"if we come up with some amazing\nwhiz-bang technology"},"504":{"dur":3,"text":"to sort out our energy problem\non the last day of 2049,"},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"just in the nick of time\nto sort things out."},"510":{"dur":3,"text":"Because in the meantime,\nemissions will have accumulated."},"514":{"dur":5,"text":"So if we continue on this red,\nfour-degree centigrade scenario pathway,"},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"the longer we continue on it,"},"522":{"dur":3,"text":"that will need to be\nmade up for in later years"},"525":{"dur":3,"text":"to keep the same carbon budget,\nto keep the same area under the curve,"},"529":{"dur":4,"text":"which means that that trajectory,\nthe red one there, becomes steeper."},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"So in other words, if we don't reduce\nemissions in the short to medium term,"},"537":{"dur":3,"text":"then we'll have to make more significant\nyear-on-year emission reductions."},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"We also know that we have\nto decarbonize our energy system."},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"But if we don't start to cut\nemissions in the short to medium term,"},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"then we will have to do that even sooner."},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"So this poses really big\nchallenges for us."},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"The other thing it does is tells us\nsomething about energy policy."},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"If you live in a part of the world where\nper capita emissions are already high,"},"565":{"dur":3,"text":"it points us towards\nreducing energy demand."},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's because\nwith all the will in the world,"},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"the large-scale engineering infrastructure"},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"that we need to roll out rapidly"},"576":{"dur":3,"text":"to decarbonize the supply side\nof our energy system"},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"is just simply not going\nto happen in time."},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"So it doesn't matter\nwhether we choose nuclear power"},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"or carbon capture and storage,"},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"upscale our biofuel production,"},"589":{"dur":4,"text":"or go for a much bigger roll-out\nof wind turbines and wave turbines."},"593":{"dur":1,"text":"All of that will take time."},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"So because it's the area\nunder the curve that matters,"},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"we need to focus on energy efficiency,"},"600":{"dur":4,"text":"but also on energy conservation --\nin other words, using less energy."},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"And if we do that, that also means"},"607":{"dur":3,"text":"that as we continue to roll out\nthe supply-side technology,"},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"we will have less of a job to do\nif we've actually managed"},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"to reduce our energy consumption,"},"616":{"dur":4,"text":"because we will then need\nless infrastructure on the supply side."},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"Another issue that we really\nneed to grapple with"},"624":{"dur":3,"text":"is the issue of well-being and equity."},"627":{"dur":4,"text":"There are many parts of the world where\nthe standard of living needs to rise."},"633":{"dur":4,"text":"Bbut with energy systems\ncurrently reliant on fossil fuel,"},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"as those economies grow\nso will emissions."},"641":{"dur":3,"text":"And now, if we're all constrained\nby the same amount of carbon budget,"},"644":{"dur":3,"text":"that means that if some parts of\nthe world's emissions are needing to rise,"},"648":{"dur":3,"text":"then other parts of the world's\nemissions need to reduce."},"653":{"dur":4,"text":"So that poses very significant challenges\nfor wealthy nations."},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"Because according to our research,"},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"if you're in a country where per capita\nemissions are really high --"},"663":{"dur":3,"text":"so North America, Europe, Australia --"},"667":{"dur":3,"text":"emissions reductions of the order\nof 10 percent per year,"},"671":{"dur":4,"text":"and starting immediately,\nwill be required for a good chance"},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"of avoiding the two-degree target."},"678":{"dur":1,"text":"Let me just put that into context."},"679":{"dur":1,"text":"The economist Nicholas Stern"},"681":{"dur":3,"text":"said that emission reductions\nof more than one percent per year"},"685":{"dur":4,"text":"had only ever been associated\nwith economic recession or upheaval."},"691":{"dur":4,"text":"So this poses huge challenges\nfor the issue of economic growth,"},"697":{"dur":3,"text":"because if we have our\nhigh carbon infrastructure in place,"},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"it means that if our economies grow,"},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"then so do our emissions."},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'd just like to take\na quote from a paper"},"708":{"dur":3,"text":"by myself and Kevin Anderson back in 2011"},"712":{"dur":5,"text":"where we said that to avoid the two-degree\nframing of dangerous climate change,"},"718":{"dur":4,"text":"economic growth needs to be exchanged\nat least temporarily"},"722":{"dur":4,"text":"for a period of planned austerity\nin wealthy nations."},"728":{"dur":3,"text":"This is a really difficult\nmessage to take,"},"732":{"dur":4,"text":"because what it suggests is that\nwe really need to do things differently."},"737":{"dur":4,"text":"This is not about just incremental change."},"741":{"dur":4,"text":"This is about doing things differently,\nabout whole system change,"},"746":{"dur":3,"text":"and sometimes\nit's about doing less things."},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"And this applies to all of us,"},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"whatever sphere of influence we have."},"755":{"dur":3,"text":"So it could be from writing\nto our local politician"},"758":{"dur":3,"text":"to talking to our boss at work\nor being the boss at work,"},"761":{"dur":4,"text":"or talking with our friends and family,\nor, quite simply, changing our lifestyles."},"767":{"dur":3,"text":"Because we really need\nto make significant change."},"770":{"dur":4,"text":"At the moment, we're choosing\na four-degree scenario."},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"If we really want to avoid\nthe two-degree scenario,"},"778":{"dur":3,"text":"there really is no time\nlike the present to

do,"},"820":{"dur":4,"text":"is they tend to hugely overestimate\nhow quickly other countries in the world"},"825":{"dur":1,"text":"can start to reduce emissions."},"826":{"dur":3,"text":"So they make kind of\nheroic assumptions about that."},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"The more we do that,\nbecause it's the cumulative emissions,"},"832":{"dur":1,"text":"the short-term stuff that really matters."},"834":{"dur":1,"text":"So it does make a huge difference."},"836":{"dur":1,"text":"If a big country like China, for example,"},"838":{"dur":2,"text":"continues to grow\neven for just a few
