suggestion of radicalism."},"591":{"dur":5,"text":"This is Babbage, man of science,\nesteemed by his peers."},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"He's about age 53, mid 50s at this day."},"600":{"dur":6,"text":"It's an oil painting by Lawrence and\nBabbage was capable of incontinent savagery."},"606":{"dur":4,"text":"He launched sarcastic public attacks against the\nscientific

1860, that he died in 1871."},"703":{"dur":5,"text":"This is the last known portrait of Babbage taken\nat the 14th statistical conference in London"},"709":{"dur":3,"text":"and this is Babbage

demonstrate"},"719":{"dur":5,"text":"to his peers through the delivery of a physical\nengine his ideas and to that extent, he failed."},"725":{"dur":3,"text":"He refused public honors because he said\nthe honor was for the engine not for himself"},"728":{"dur":5,"text":"and since he failed to deliver one, he refused\nto accept it on his own behalf as it were."},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"Despite that during his years he\nached for honors, he ached for honors,"},"738":{"dur":6,"text":"he drew up lists of comparisons of penchants\nand emoluments that his peers had received"},"745":{"dur":3,"text":"as dispensations from government\nand that he had been denied."},"748":{"dur":4,"text":"So he had a strong sense of injustice, a strong\nsense of being overlooked and yet nonetheless,"},"753":{"dur":4,"text":"he preferred actually to remain in some\nsense obscure in his acknowledgment"},"759":{"dur":1,"text":"because of the lack of recognition [inaudible]."},"760":{"dur":8,"text":"So this is Babbage and his first biographer\ntitled the biography the Irascible Genius,"},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"the Irascible Genius and that perhaps--"},"771":{"dur":7,"text":"that was 1963 and that is if when looking\nfor a single signature characterization,"},"778":{"dur":3,"text":"a thumbnail characterization of Babbage, then\nIrascible Genius does the job pretty well."},"782":{"dur":6,"text":"[ Pause ]"},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"So what we have is a complex\nand colorful character."},"793":{"dur":3,"text":"He authorized six full books, nearly\n90 articles on a massive range."},"796":{"dur":4,"text":"Even by the standards of Victorian polymathy,\nthis is a very wide range of interest."},"801":{"dur":5,"text":"We're talking about a man who was proud,"},"807":{"dur":3,"text":"principled beyond reason,\nprincipled beyond reason."},"810":{"dur":3,"text":"He would attack people on grounds\nof principle quite regardless"},"814":{"dur":1,"text":"of the political implications of so doing."},"816":{"dur":3,"text":"He behaved as though being\nright entitled him to be rude."},"821":{"dur":8,"text":"And this is, again, is a characteristic that\ncharacterized much of his public conduct."},"832":{"dur":2,"text":"[Inaudible Remark] [Laughter]\nNonetheless, he had great charm."},"834":{"dur":1,"text":"He was a prized dinner guest."},"836":{"dur":4,"text":"Mr. Babbage's coming to dinner\nwas a triumph for any hostess."},"840":{"dur":6,"text":"Yet he was capable of wounding abrasiveness, you\ncan see this disconnection between the need to--"},"846":{"dur":3,"text":"schmoosing wasn't his strong suit, we could say."},"850":{"dur":1,"text":"So politically there was huge ineptness."},"852":{"dur":4,"text":"He didn't understand that having failed to\nbuild Difference Engine 1, it was more important"},"857":{"dur":5,"text":"to finish a machine that was not his latest\ndesign as a staging posting credibility"},"862":{"dur":4,"text":"in political terms than it was to try\nand sell his latest design to government,"},"868":{"dur":3,"text":"try and convince, to develop on\ngovernment to abandon huge investment"},"871":{"dur":2,"text":"in his earlier design and\nbuild his analytical engine."},"874":{"dur":4,"text":"So you can see there's a political kind\nof inaptitude there which came together"},"878":{"dur":4,"text":"with this boldness, this independence\nand this pride, this huge pride."},"883":{"dur":1,"text":"So, so much for Babbage."},"885":{"dur":6,"text":"That's a kind of quick context of,\nyou know, who Babbage was and briefly,"},"891":{"dur":5,"text":"the trajectory from an idealistic student into\nan imminent man of science, into a disillusioned"},"897":{"dur":9,"text":"and to some extent embittered in older age."},"907":{"dur":1,"text":"So, what were his engines about?"},"909":{"dur":0,"text":"What was he trying to do?"},"910":{"dur":1,"text":"What were his expectations?"},"912":{"dur":2,"text":"What triggered, what was the jumping\noff point for this whole thing?"},"914":{"dur":6,"text":"It's captured in a delightful vignette\nwhich occurred in 1821 where Charles Babbage"},"921":{"dur":2,"text":"and John Herschel, his great friend\nfrom Cambridge, the astronomer,"},"924":{"dur":3,"text":"were checking mathematical tables, mathematical\ntables were calculated by hand in those days,"},"928":{"dur":2,"text":"by, as Dan said, by people called computers."},"930":{"dur":1,"text":"And we have Babbage and

collaboration."},"938":{"dur":3,"text":"And the idea is if these tallied then you\nhave fairly high degree of confidence,"},"942":{"dur":4,"text":"they were instances of both groups making\nthe same

tables."},"952":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, Babbage and Herschel are\nsitting there checking these tables."},"955":{"dur":1,"text":"One is reading out the result,\nthe other one is checking it."},"957":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, Babbage becomes increasingly agitated\nand he clasped his hand to his head as it were"},"963":{"dur":4,"text":"and he says, \"I wish to God these\ncalculations had been executed by steam.\""},"968":{"dur":4,"text":"And Peter Ackroyd, the novelist\nand historian has said,"},"973":{"dur":2,"text":"\"This is the most wonderful\nsentence of 19th

it,"},"985":{"dur":2,"text":"but it was a metaphor for production."},"989":{"dur":3,"text":"You could now produce tables on demand"},"992":{"dur":3,"text":"and amateur astronomers were

tables for the\ntrajectory of new stars"},"1004":{"dur":3,"text":"and the reason they were sitting there\ndoing these astronomical tables was"},"1007":{"dur":1,"text":"to provide these tables."},"1009":{"dur":2,"text":"So, here you could have tables on demand."},"1012":{"dur":3,"text":"You could turn the handle\nliterally and metaphorically,"},"1016":{"dur":2,"text":"and produce tables at will for new functions."},"1019":{"dur":5,"text":"You didn't have to go through the\nhuge procedure of the production."},"1025":{"dur":4,"text":"Tables it should be said at that stage were\nindispensable for science, for engineering,"},"1029":{"dur":5,"text":"for navigation, particularly for navigation, for\ntaxation, and for surveying, you were reliant."},"1034":{"dur":4,"text":"The only portable means of doing complex\ncalculations beyond trivial arithmetic was"},"1039":{"dur":1,"text":"through printed mathematical tables."},"1041":{"dur":4,"text":"So, what was involved in the\nproduction of printed mathematical?"},"1045":{"dur":6,"text":"That's a set of logarithms, a piece of a\npage of a logarithm from Von Vega 1794."},"1052":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's what Babbage is trying to produce."},"1054":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, how was that produced?"},"1055":{"dur":2,"text":"Firstly, manual calculation."},"1058":{"dur":1,"text":"People-- human being sat\nthere and did the calculation."},"1060":{"dur":4,"text":"Secondly, you then have to transcribe the\nresults into lists to give to a typesetter."},"1065":{"dur":5,"text":"The typesetter would set each\nindividual digit in loose type."},"1071":{"dur":4,"text":"So you took a piece of type for every\nsingle digit there and to create the page,"},"1076":{"dur":2,"text":"this is purely for dissemination, this\nis to communicate the tables elsewhere."},"1078":{"dur":2,"text":"You have to have a mechanical\nmethod of production."},"1081":{"dur":1,"text":"And then finally, verification."},"1083":{"dur":3,"text":"You had to check to see that the\nlists on the tables were great."},"1086":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's calculation, transcription,\ntypesetting, and verification."},"1091":{"dur":5,"text":"Now Babbage's conception was a machine would\neliminate all sources of error at a stroke."},"1097":{"dur":2,"text":"So it would have automatic typesetting built in."},"1100":{"dur":2,"text":"It would have a built in printer,\nnot only produce hard copy,"},"1102":{"dur":2,"text":"ink hard copy because that you\nwould still have to transcribe."},"1106":{"dur":2,"text":"It also automatically produced\nstereotype plates."},"1108":{"dur":1,"text":"So the results were stereotyped."},"1110":{"dur":4,"text":"They were impressed on trays with soft material,\neither plaster of Paris or copper paper

okay, why spend staggering\nsums of money equivalent--"},"1133":{"dur":3,"text":"spend equivalent of, in today's\nterms, 100 million pounds"},"1137":{"dur":1,"text":"on the engine that he never
