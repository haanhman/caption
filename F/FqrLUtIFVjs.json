last year, 100 million of us,\nmostly Americans,"},"37":{"dur":5,"text":"lost our health insurance data\nto thieves -- myself included."},"44":{"dur":5,"text":"What's particularly concerning about this\nis that in most cases,"},"49":{"dur":5,"text":"it was months before anyone even\nreported that these records were stolen."},"56":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you watch the evening news,"},"60":{"dur":5,"text":"you would think that most of this\nis espionage or nation-state activity."},"65":{"dur":2,"text":"And, well, some of it is."},"68":{"dur":4,"text":"Espionage, you see, is an accepted\ninternational practice."},"73":{"dur":1,"text":"But in this case,"},"75":{"dur":5,"text":"it is only a small portion\nof the problem that we're dealing with."},"81":{"dur":3,"text":"How often do we hear about a breach"},"84":{"dur":4,"text":"followed by, \"... it was the result\nof a sophisticated nation-state attack?\""},"90":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, often that is companies\nnot being willing to own up"},"95":{"dur":2,"text":"to their own lackluster\nsecurity practices."},"98":{"dur":2,"text":"There is also a widely held belief"},"102":{"dur":3,"text":"that by blaming an attack\non a nation-state,"},"106":{"dur":2,"text":"you are putting regulators at bay --"},"108":{"dur":2,"text":"at least for a period of time."},"111":{"dur":4,"text":"So where is all of this coming from?"},"116":{"dur":5,"text":"The United Nations estimates\nthat 80 percent of it"},"122":{"dur":5,"text":"is from highly organized\nand ultrasophisticated criminal gangs."},"129":{"dur":1,"text":"To date,"},"130":{"dur":6,"text":"this represents one of the largest\nillegal economies in the world,"},"137":{"dur":3,"text":"topping out at, now get this,"},"140":{"dur":4,"text":"445 billion dollars."},"145":{"dur":2,"text":"Let me put that in perspective\nfor all of you:"},"148":{"dur":6,"text":"445 billion dollars is larger than the GDP"},"154":{"dur":2,"text":"of 160

work?"},"166":{"dur":1,"text":"How do these criminals operate?"},"168":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, let me tell you a little story."},"172":{"dur":1,"text":"About a year ago,"},"173":{"dur":3,"text":"our security researchers were tracking"},"176":{"dur":6,"text":"a somewhat ordinary but sophisticated\nbanking Trojan called the Dyre Wolf."},"183":{"dur":2,"text":"The Dyre Wolf would get on your

wait."},"193":{"dur":3,"text":"It would wait until you logged\ninto your bank account."},"197":{"dur":3,"text":"And when you did,\nthe bad guys would reach in,"},"200":{"dur":1,"text":"steal your credentials,"},"202":{"dur":1,"text":"and then use that to steal your money."},"204":{"dur":1,"text":"This sounds terrible,"},"206":{"dur":2,"text":"but the reality is,\nin the security industry,"},"209":{"dur":3,"text":"this form of attack\nis somewhat commonplace."},"215":{"dur":6,"text":"However, the Dyre Wolf had\ntwo distinctly different personalities --"},"222":{"dur":2,"text":"one for these small transactions,"},"224":{"dur":3,"text":"but it took on an entirely\ndifferent persona"},"227":{"dur":3,"text":"if you were in the business of moving\nlarge-scale wire transfers."},"231":{"dur":1,"text":"Here's what would happen."},"233":{"dur":2,"text":"You start the process\nof issuing a wire transfer,"},"236":{"dur":3,"text":"and up in your browser would pop\na screen from your bank,"},"239":{"dur":2,"text":"indicating that there's a problem\nwith your account,"},"241":{"dur":3,"text":"and that you need to call\nthe bank immediately,"},"245":{"dur":2,"text":"along with the number\nto the bank's fraud department."},"248":{"dur":2,"text":"So you pick up the phone and you call."},"250":{"dur":3,"text":"And after going through\nthe normal voice prompts,"},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"you're met with\nan English-speaking operator."},"256":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Hello, Altoro Mutual Bank.\nHow can I help you?\""},"259":{"dur":3,"text":"And you go through the process\nlike you do every time you call your bank,"},"263":{"dur":2,"text":"of giving them your name\nand your account number,"},"266":{"dur":3,"text":"going through the security checks\nto verify you are who you said you are."},"271":{"dur":1,"text":"Most of us may not know this,"},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"but in many large-scale wire transfers,"},"275":{"dur":3,"text":"it requires two people to sign off\non the wire transfer,"},"278":{"dur":3,"text":"so the operator then asks you\nto get the second person on the line,"},"281":{"dur":2,"text":"and goes through the same set\nof verifications and checks."},"285":{"dur":1,"text":"Sounds normal, right?"},"287":{"dur":1,"text":"Only one problem:"},"289":{"dur":1,"text":"you're not talking to the bank."},"291":{"dur":1,"text":"You're talking to the criminals."},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"They had built\nan English-speaking help desk,"},"294":{"dur":2,"text":"fake overlays to the banking website."},"296":{"dur":3,"text":"And this was so flawlessly executed"},"300":{"dur":2,"text":"that they were moving\nbetween a half a million"},"302":{"dur":3,"text":"and a million and a half\ndollars per attempt"},"305":{"dur":1,"text":"into their criminal coffers."},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"These criminal organizations operate"},"310":{"dur":3,"text":"like highly regimented,\nlegitimate businesses."},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"Their employees work\nMonday through Friday."},"317":{"dur":1,"text":"They take the weekends off."},"318":{"dur":1,"text":"How do we know this?"},"320":{"dur":3,"text":"We know this because\nour security researchers see"},"323":{"dur":3,"text":"repeated spikes of malware\non a Friday afternoon."},"327":{"dur":3,"text":"The bad guys, after a long weekend\nwith the wife and kids,"},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"come back in to see how well things went."},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"The Dark Web is where\nthey spend their time."},"339":{"dur":5,"text":"That is a term used to describe\nthe anonymous underbelly of the internet,"},"344":{"dur":2,"text":"where thieves can operate with anonymity"},"347":{"dur":1,"text":"and without detection."},"350":{"dur":3,"text":"Here they peddle their attack software"},"353":{"dur":3,"text":"and share information\non new attack techniques."},"357":{"dur":1,"text":"You can buy everything there,"},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"from a base-level attack\nto a much more advanced version."},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact, in many cases, you even see"},"365":{"dur":3,"text":"gold, silver and bronze levels of service."},"369":{"dur":1,"text":"You can check references."},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"You can even buy attacks"},"374":{"dur":3,"text":"that come with a money-back guarantee --"},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"378":{"dur":1,"text":"if you're not successful."},"381":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, these environments,\nthese marketplaces --"},"384":{"dur":3,"text":"they look like an Amazon or an eBay."},"388":{"dur":3,"text":"You see products, prices,\nratings and reviews."},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"Of course, if you're going\nto buy an attack,"},"394":{"dur":3,"text":"you're going to buy from a reputable\ncriminal with good ratings, right?"},"397":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"398":{"dur":1,"text":"This isn't any different"},"400":{"dur":5,"text":"than checking on Yelp or TripAdvisor\nbefore going to a new restaurant."},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"So, here is an example."},"408":{"dur":5,"text":"This is an actual screenshot\nof a vendor selling malware."},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"Notice they're a vendor level four,"},"415":{"dur":1,"text":"they have a trust level of six."},"417":{"dur":2,"text":"They've had 400 positive reviews\nin the last year,"},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"and only two negative reviews\nin the last month."},"422":{"dur":3,"text":"We even see things like licensing terms."},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"Here's an example of a site you can go to"},"428":{"dur":1,"text":"if you want to change your identity."},"430":{"dur":1,"text":"They will sell you a fake ID,"},"432":{"dur":1,"text":"fake passports."},"434":{"dur":5,"text":"But note the legally binding terms\nfor purchasing your fake ID."},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"Give me a break."},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"What are they going to do --\nsue you if you violate them?"},"444":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"This occurred a couple of months ago."},"449":{"dur":3,"text":"One of our security\nresearchers was looking"},"453":{"dur":4,"text":"at a new Android malware application\nthat we had discovered."},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"It was called Bilal Bot."},"461":{"dur":1,"text":"In a blog post,"},"463":{"dur":6,"text":"she positioned Bilal Bot\nas a new, inexpensive and beta alternative"},"470":{"dur":3,"text":"to the much more advanced GM Bot"},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"that was commonplace\nin the criminal underground."},"478":{"dur":4,"text":"This review did not sit well\nwith the authors of Bilal Bot."},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"So they wrote her this very email,"},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"pleading their case\nand making the argument"},"489":{"dur":5,"text":"that they felt she had evaluated\nan older version."},"496":{"dur":4,"text":"They asked her to please update\nher blog with more accurate information"},"500":{"dur":3,"text":"and even offered to do an interview"},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"to describe to her in detail"},"506":{"dur":4,"text":"how their attack software was now\nfar better than the competition."},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"So look,"},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"you don't have to like what they do,"},"517":{"dur":4,"text":"but you do have to respect\nthe entrepreneurial nature"},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"of their endeavors."},"523":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"526":{"dur":3,"text":"So how are we going to stop this?"},"531":{"dur":5,"text":"It's not like we're going to be able\nto identify who's responsible --"},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"remember, they operate with anonymity"},"540":{"dur":1,"text":"and outside the reach of the law."},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"We're certainly not going to be able\nto prosecute the offenders."},"546":{"dur":5,"text":"I would propose that we need\na completely new approach."},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"And that approach needs\nto be centered on the idea"},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"that we need to change\nthe economics for the bad guys."},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"And to give you a perspective\non how this can work,"},"565":{"dur":4,"text":"let's think of the response we see\nto a healthcare pandemic:"},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"SARS, Ebola, bird flu, Zika."},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"What is the top priority?"},"575":{"dur":5,"text":"It's knowing who is infected\nand how the disease is spreading."},"583":{"dur":6,"text":"Now, governments, private institutions,\nhospitals, physicians --"},"590":{"dur":3,"text":"everyone responds openly and quickly."},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"This is a collective and altruistic effort"},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"to stop the spread in its tracks"},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"and to inform anyone not infected"},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"how to protect or inoculate themselves."},"610":{"dur":5,"text":"Unfortunately, this is not at all\nwhat we see in response to a cyber attack."},"617":{"dur":4,"text":"Organizations are far more likely\nto keep information on that attack"},"622":{"dur":1,"text":"to themselves."},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"Why?"},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"Because they're worried\nabout competitive advantage,"},"629":{"dur":1,"text":"litigation"},"631":{"dur":1,"text":"or regulation."},"633":{"dur":5,"text":"We need to effectively democratize\nthreat intelligence data."},"639":{"dur":5,"text":"We need to get all of these organizations\nto open up and share"},"645":{"dur":3,"text":"what is in their private arsenal\nof information."},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"The bad guys are moving fast;"},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"we've got to move faster."},"656":{"dur":3,"text":"And the best way to do that is to open up"},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"and share data on what's happening."},"663":{"dur":4,"text":"Let's think about this in the construct\nof security professionals."},"667":{"dur":4,"text":"Remember, they're programmed right\ninto their DNA to keep secrets."},"672":{"dur":3,"text":"We've got to turn\nthat thinking on its head."},"676":{"dur":3,"text":"We've got to get governments,\nprivate institutions"},"679":{"dur":1,"text":"and security companies"},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"willing to share information at speed."},"683":{"dur":1,"text":"And here's why:"},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"because if you share the information,"},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"it's equivalent to inoculation."},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"And if you're not sharing,"},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"you're actually part of the problem,"},"694":{"dur":5,"text":"because you're increasing the odds\nthat other people could be impacted"},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"by the same attack techniques."},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"But there's an even bigger benefit."},"707":{"dur":4,"text":"By destroying criminals' devices\ncloser to real time,"},"711":{"dur":1,"text":"we break their plans."},"715":{"dur":3,"text":"We inform the people they aim to hurt"},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"far sooner than they had ever anticipated."},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"We ruin their reputations,"},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"we crush their ratings and reviews."},"728":{"dur":3,"text":"We make cybercrime not pay."},"732":{"dur":3,"text":"We change the economics for the bad guys."},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"But to do this,\na first mover was required --"},"742":{"dur":4,"text":"someone to change the thinking\nin the security industry overall."},"747":{"dur":1,"text":"About a year ago,"},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"my colleagues and I had a radical idea."},"752":{"dur":4,"text":"What if IBM were to take our data --"},"757":{"dur":3,"text":"we had one of the largest threat\nintelligence databases in the world --"},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"and open it up?"},"763":{"dur":3,"text":"It had information not just\non what had happened in the past,"},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"but what was happening in near-real time."},"769":{"dur":3,"text":"What if we were to publish it all\nopenly on the internet?"},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"As you can imagine,\nthis got quite a reaction."},"776":{"dur":1,"text":"First came the lawyers:"},"778":{"dur":2,"text":"What are the legal\nimplications of doing that?"},"781":{"dur":1,"text":"Then came the business:"},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"What are the business\nimplications of doing that?"},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"And this was also met with a good dose"},"787":{"dur":3,"text":"of a lot of people just asking\nif we were completely crazy."},"791":{"dur":3,"text":"But there was one conversation\nthat kept floating to the surface"},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"in every dialogue that we would have:"},"798":{"dur":3,"text":"the realization that if we didn't do this,"},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"then we were part of the problem."},"805":{"dur":2,"text":"So we did something unheard of\nin the security industry."},"808":{"dur":1,"text":"We started publishing."},"810":{"dur":4,"text":"Over 700 terabytes of actionable\nthreat intelligence data,"},"814":{"dur":3,"text":"including information on real-time attacks"},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"that can be used to stop\ncybercrime in its

100."},"830":{"dur":4,"text":"And our hope as a next step\nis to get all of those organizations"},"834":{"dur":1,"text":"to join us in the fight,"},"836":{"dur":1,"text":"and do the same thing"},"838":{"dur":2,"text":"and share their information"},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"on when and how\nthey're being attacked as well."},"843":{"dur":3,"text":"We all have the opportunity to stop
