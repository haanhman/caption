{"0":{"dur":6,"text":"Today, we're going to experience vintage made new again with this Women's Peaked  Hat, coming up next."},"6":{"dur":16,"text":"[Intro music plays]"},"23":{"dur":4,"text":"Welcome back to the Crochet Crowd as well as Yarnspirations.com, I'm your host, Mikey,"},"27":{"dur":5,"text":"today we're going to experience the women's peaked hat, and this is a great vintage pattern that has been revived"},"33":{"dur":5,"text":"and it looks absolutely amazing and its a lot more easier to crochet than it looks like."},"38":{"dur":5,"text":"So what we're going to be doing today is I'm going to be showing you pattern tips in order for you to make this successfully"},"43":{"dur":4,"text":"and to make it much faster when you know the key elements."},"48":{"dur":2,"text":"First of all, we're going to review the back of the hat,"},"51":{"dur":4,"text":"and you will notice in the side profile that the back of the hat is more of a flat shape, just like so"},"56":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'm going to show you some key components,"},"58":{"dur":4,"text":"because when it comes to all these spokes here in the back, you're going to notice that there is a pattern,"},"63":{"dur":2,"text":"even if you don't see it within the instructions."},"66":{"dur":3,"text":"Within today's pattern you're going to be noticing a set of written instructions"},"69":{"dur":7,"text":"and you can follow those very easily, but I really like the crochet diagram that is being shown on the second page of the instructions."},"76":{"dur":4,"text":"This is what I refer to when I'm reading my instructions"},"80":{"dur":2,"text":"and what I really want to point out to you"},"82":{"dur":4,"text":"is that I want to show you the correlation of the spokes vs. the pattern here"},"87":{"dur":5,"text":"and that I was really confused on rounds number 5 and 6 as well as 7 and 8"},"92":{"dur":4,"text":"because I wasn't understanding that there was a correlation to how this hat was growing."},"96":{"dur":3,"text":"Because there are 16 spokes that go around this,"},"100":{"dur":8,"text":"growing this hat actually is a little more harder when you're actually going to read the instructions because you're thinking that the diagram is wrong and you're thinking that the designer is wrong."},"108":{"dur":7,"text":"What's happening here is that in a normal hat you would have normally around 12 of these spokes and usually its a flat hat so its not as obvious as it is today"},"116":{"dur":5,"text":"and what you usually have is that you have 4 single crochet and then 2 into the next, 4 single crochet, 2 into the next,"},"122":{"dur":3,"text":"but because there are 16 here, these do not grow equally."},"126":{"dur":9,"text":"So in rounds number 5 and 6, and 7 and 8, you're going to notice that there is a differential in the instructions because it has to grow naturally without getting too big."},"136":{"dur":7,"text":"If it gets big too fast then what happens is that the hat loses the formation and doesn't appear to be flat at the back."},"143":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'm gonna just show you"},"144":{"dur":1,"text":"another tip, right now."},"146":{"dur":4,"text":"So let's review the diagram a little more carefully and you can read this in the instructions as well,"},"151":{"dur":2,"text":"but the diagram is a lot easier to tell"},"153":{"dur":3,"text":"So what's gonna happen in rows number 5 and 6, so right here in here,"},"157":{"dur":4,"text":"and 7 and 8, is a differential of stitches in between the spokes."},"162":{"dur":6,"text":"So lets review number 5 first, so 5 will come around and then you'll have one double crochet sitting by itself"},"168":{"dur":2,"text":"and then you're going to have the actual spoke."},"171":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, so these are the spokes, I've done them in green and pink,"},"174":{"dur":6,"text":"and if you follow around the next one will have two double crochets to the same one underneath and then a spoke"},"180":{"dur":2,"text":"and then there's one by itself and then a spoke."},"182":{"dur":4,"text":"So you can see here that up until round number 4 we have been growing equally"},"187":{"dur":9,"text":"but in 5, what happens is that there's gonna be one double crochet by itself and on the other side of the spoke it'll be 2 and then there'll be 1 and 2."},"197":{"dur":6,"text":"So how it works out is that number 6 then is that this one that's sitting by itself will then end up being 2,"},"204":{"dur":7,"text":"there'll be 2 put into there and then these 2 that were put into row number 5 is that 1 double crochet will be in each"},"211":{"dur":7,"text":"so really 5 basically is the start of the growing but its not growing in between each spoke, its just growing in every other one"},"218":{"dur":6,"text":"and then 6 its growing again but its growing into the one that wasn't growing in number 5."},"224":{"dur":1,"text":"Hopefully that makes sense."},"226":{"dur":4,"text":"Same thing is happening with 7, so 7 we have 2 double crochets sitting by themselves"},"231":{"dur":5,"text":"the next one we're going to have 2 into the same and then a third one over here."},"237":{"dur":5,"text":"So basically you have two double crochets here, this one there's gonna be 3, 2, and 3."},"243":{"dur":4,"text":"So then we come around to number 8, then these 2 end up becoming 3,"},"247":{"dur":9,"text":"this is 3, 3, 3, so you can kind of see that within 5 all the way to 8 is growing slowly but its not growing equally"},"256":{"dur":5,"text":"so that there's not the same rows in between all of the spokes and hopefully that makes a lot of sense to you."},"262":{"dur":4,"text":"Just for fun today I'm going to be using Patons Canadiana and this is an acrylic yarn,"},"267":{"dur":7,"text":"you can see on the instructions that its a 5mm crochet hook today which we're going to be using off camera as well as its realy great"},"274":{"dur":7,"text":"you only need actually one ball for one of these so if you're substituting your yarn just make sure it matches this information and of course the more information of this video"},"281":{"dur":5,"text":"I will provide at link for the pattern as well as pattern details in regards to the yarn."},"287":{"dur":4,"text":"So as per the diagram and probably what you already know, we're going to be starting at the top of the hat"},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"So let's create a slip knot to begin"},"293":{"dur":1,"text":"and like so,"},"295":{"dur":5,"text":"And remember we have other, slower tutorials if you are just learning to crochet, we do have other tutorials on doing things like that."},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"A lot more slower within our channel."},"303":{"dur":3,"text":"We're going to begin and we're going to do a chaining of 3."},"307":{"dur":5,"text":"So 1, 2, 3, and let's form the center ring of the hat."},"312":{"dur":5,"text":"So we're just going to come into the very center, like so, sorry, the very starting chain, just like so."},"317":{"dur":2,"text":"Pull through the yarn, like this"},"321":{"dur":6,"text":"and basically, you have a ring, kind of hard to tell, its a little tight, but if you have it too big then you're going to have a hole."},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"right in the top of your hat, and we don't want that."},"329":{"dur":4,"text":"So let's start our first round, very simple, we're just going to start and begin with a chain 3."},"334":{"dur":5,"text":"So 1, 2, and 3, and we're gonna do 7 double crochets into the center."},"339":{"dur":8,"text":"Seven is kind of a weird number, right? But remember in the rules of crochet that this chaining of 3 counts as one of the double crochets there, so its' actually 8"},"347":{"dur":6,"text":"So we're going to put in 7 double crochets right into the center, so just pull it open, look for the center of that ring"},"354":{"dur":3,"text":"And we're going to put in 7 double crochets"},"357":{"dur":0,"text":"So that was 1,"},"358":{"dur":1,"text":"and 2"},"361":{"dur":1,"text":"we have 3,"},"364":{"dur":1,"text":"4"},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"and 5,"},"371":{"dur":0,"text":"6"},"373":{"dur":1,"text":"and 7"},"374":{"dur":5,"text":"so you're going to notice right away, its like whoa! that did not go all the way around, you have to trust the pattern."},"379":{"dur":5,"text":"So if you're counting at this point, remember that the chain 3 counts as a double crochet so you can actually count that out"},"385":{"dur":6,"text":"so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, so basically the chain 3 plus 7 double crochets equals 8."},"391":{"dur":7,"text":"So let's begin, we're going to slip stitch the top of the chain 3 that we started with and that's gonna pull it into a final circle."},"399":{"dur":1,"text":"So just pull through and through"},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"Never go into the gap just like I'm showing there,"},"403":{"dur":10,"text":"always go into a chain space or chain area of that and then that will pull it nice and closed so you aren't putting any gaudy gaps in your work."},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's move on to round 2."},"416":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's begin number two but there's some special"},"417":{"dur":1,"text":"instructions that we need to pay"},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"attention to - it says chain two - now if"},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"you look at the special instructions"},"422":{"dur":1,"text":"above it says chain two at the beginning"},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"of the round does not count as a stitch"},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"that's important-  because you don't want"},"427":{"dur":1,"text":"to miss count any of your stuff that's"},"429":{"dur":1,"text":"going all the way around.
