simple."},"167":{"dur":2,"text":"It's stated in one sentence."},"170":{"dur":3,"text":"No one shall be subjected to torture."},"173":{"dur":1,"text":"That's the law on torture."},"174":{"dur":3,"text":"And, there's a lot that's\npacked into that, obviously."},"178":{"dur":4,"text":"No one means no one, no person,\nno matter who they

clear,\nforceful, unequivocal terms as that."},"205":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact,\nthe strict language that we see in the,"},"209":{"dur":3,"text":"the key UN Treaty,\nthe UN Convention Against Torture,"},"212":{"dur":3,"text":"which goes a little bit further\nthan what I've just recited."},"216":{"dur":7,"text":"And, and makes it clear that that no\nexceptional circumstances whatsoever."},"223":{"dur":5,"text":"It's a great word, whatsoever,\ncan serve as a justification for torture."},"228":{"dur":3,"text":"And, you only see that in one\nother UN human rights treaty,

gap"},"263":{"dur":4,"text":"between that promise and what the reality\nof torture is around the world."},"269":{"dur":4,"text":"And, let me start by reminding us of\nthe human side of this, because

from the supreme"},"283":{"dur":4,"text":"court of Canada, but this is about people,\nit's about human stories."},"287":{"dur":3,"text":"And of course, given that it's torture,\nit's about human

him."},"431":{"dur":4,"text":"First, it was at the hands of the police,\nhe was beaten repeatedly in the ribs."},"435":{"dur":4,"text":"He was forced to walk around for\nhours endlessly on his knees."},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"He was kicked, and\npunched repeatedly in the stomach."},"444":{"dur":1,"text":"And then, it got worse."},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"He was transferred to the

then, back to the point\nof asphyxiation and back."},"475":{"dur":3,"text":"It's sort of like the dry land\nversion of waterboarding."},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"An absolutely grueling form of torture."},"480":{"dur":1,"text":"He was stripped."},"481":{"dur":5,"text":"And forced to lick clean the boots\nof other prisoners and the guards."},"487":{"dur":4,"text":"He was made to strike a number\nof humiliating poses."},"492":{"dur":5,"text":"And all throughout that endlessly racial\nimp, insults being hurled at him."},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"And on and on it went,\nfor 16 nonstop hours."},"501":{"dur":1,"text":"And finally, he relented."},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"And he signed a statement."},"504":{"dur":0,"text":"You're right."},"505":{"dur":1,"text":"I was part of a criminal

one cared, no one listened."},"529":{"dur":3,"text":"Certainly no one tried to give\nhim a remedy of any kind."},"533":{"dur":5,"text":"That went on for six years before\nhe was finally able to get

mobilize."},"546":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, after that visit,\nworldwide we campaigned relentless for"},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"his release and here's the good news."},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"And there is

out."},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"He's back in Honduras."},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"The attorney general saw the light of day."},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"And dropped the charges in the case."},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"But his experience still hangs there."},"573":{"dur":4,"text":"And what is particularly important\nto remember is there is nothing"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"even remotely singular about it."},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"His case is not one of dozens or\neven hundreds but"},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"it's one of thousands in Mexico alone."},"587":{"dur":5,"text":"In Mexico over the last decade levels\nof torture have increased not two fold,"},"593":{"dur":5,"text":"not three fold,\nincreased 600% in the last 10 years and"},"599":{"dur":5,"text":"Mexico is just one country\namongst the very very many."},"604":{"dur":4,"text":"And what that reflects is when\nwe think of Angel's story and"},"608":{"dur":3,"text":"his experience is simply this."},"611":{"dur":4,"text":"Torture continues to haunt\nfar too many corners."},"616":{"dur":1,"text":"Every corner of our planet."},"618":{"dur":4,"text":"And that what it means is that routinely\nand brutally and secretively, brazenly,"},"623":{"dur":4,"text":"insidiously, cruelly and\nI assure you always, with absolute and"},"628":{"dur":5,"text":"total impunity, men,\nwomen, and young people"},"634":{"dur":4,"text":"face that harrowing nightmare\nof torture every single day."},"638":{"dur":5,"text":"And that's why Amnesty International\nhas launched a new campaign."},"644":{"dur":3,"text":"For the fourth time in\nour 50 plus years now."},"647":{"dur":4,"text":"A campaign to really bring attention\nto be an issue of torture."},"651":{"dur":4,"text":"It's got a simple slogan because\nthe slogan captures what it's all about,"},"656":{"dur":0,"text":"stop torture."},"659":{"dur":4,"text":"And we've launched this campaign\nbecause we can't not respond"},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"to six hundred percent\nmore torture in Mexico,"},"666":{"dur":4,"text":"to that huge gap between those beautiful\nforceful clear words in U.N. treaties."},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"And the reality on the ground."},"674":{"dur":6,"text":"Here's one other quick statistic that will\ngive you a sense as to how urgent this is."},"681":{"dur":1,"text":"As we launch the campaign,"},"682":{"dur":3,"text":"we announced to the world that\njust based on our own research."},"685":{"dur":4,"text":"And we never pretend that we have every\nhuman rights fact about every violation"},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"happening in every country everywhere."},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"But based on our own information,"},"693":{"dur":4,"text":"in the last five years,\nthere's been torture in 141 countries."},"698":{"dur":5,"text":"That's about three-quarters\nof the world's states."},"703":{"dur":0,"text":"In 2015."},"704":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm not talking about 1971,\nor 1956, or even 1984."},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"In 2015."},"712":{"dur":1,"text":"So, it's a very necessary campaign."},"713":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a campaign that will push\nGovernments to prevent torture."},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"Because that's ultimately\nwhat we need to be doing."},"721":{"dur":5,"text":"We can't continue to just endlessly\nhave to mobilize to respond"},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"to every Angel Colon that comes along."},"729":{"dur":4,"text":"We need to prevent it,\nstop it from happening in the first place."},"733":{"dur":4,"text":"And it is certainly a campaign that is\ngoing to firmly reject the notion that"},"737":{"dur":5,"text":"torture can ever, for\nany reason be excused or justified."},"743":{"dur":4,"text":"And let's just take a moment\nto explore that piece of it."},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"Torture is never excused."},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"Remember, those clear\nwords from the treaty."},"753":{"dur":4,"text":"Whatsoever, never excused because it so"},"758":{"dur":6,"text":"fundamentally destroys the very\nessence of human dignity and integrity"},"764":{"dur":5,"text":"on which the entire notion of having\nhuman rights in the first place rests."},"769":{"dur":5,"text":"Allowing torture, creates divisions,\ncreates more victims."},"775":{"dur":5,"text":"It widens the gaps amongst and\nbetween us as a human family."},"781":{"dur":3,"text":"More and more victims,\nmore and more survivors."},"785":{"dur":6,"text":"It maims, it dehumanizes, it traumatizes,\nand very, very often, it kills."},"791":{"dur":4,"text":"Individuals are brutalized, and\nfamilies are terrified directly."},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"Most of those who feel the direct\nimpact of torture, but"},"799":{"dur":1,"text":"it's wider than that of course."},"800":{"dur":4,"text":"Communities are absolutely\nterrorized into silence."},"806":{"dur":4,"text":"And in the end, really,\nall torture has done is lay the ground for"},"810":{"dur":1,"text":"more human rights violations."},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"But also, for deeper insecurity."},"816":{"dur":5,"text":"And that's why, every time they've\ncome to it, in any treaty."},"821":{"dur":0,"text":"Governments."},"823":{"dur":2,"text":"Not Amnesty International,\nI wasn't holding the pen."},"825":{"dur":1,"text":"Governments."},"826":{"dur":5,"text":"Wrote the obligation in that clear\nabsolutely unequivocably way."},"832":{"dur":2,"text":"Because they knew that torture for"},"834":{"dur":3,"text":"any reason is the very\nantithesis of human rights."},"840":{"dur":3,"text":"No exceptions also though\nbecause torture doesn't work."},"845":{"dur":2,"text":"Not that I want you to think\nthat that would convince me,"},"848":{"dur":3,"text":"if someone suddenly showed me that\ntorture did work, that I'd be on board,"},"851":{"dur":3,"text":"absolutely not, but it's an additional\npiece to take account of here."},"854":{"dur":3,"text":"People will say anything,\nthey will confess to anything,"},"858":{"dur":4,"text":"they will finger anyone,\nto bring the agony of torture to an end."},"862":{"dur":5,"text":"That's what Angel Colon was telling\nus in that Nayarit prison cell."},"867":{"dur":4,"text":"I've heard that repeatedly from\nthe hundreds of torture survivors I've"},"872":{"dur":5,"text":"interviewed in Canada, in prisons,\nin refugee camps right around the world."},"880":{"dur":1,"text":"But also remember this piece,"},"881":{"dur":5,"text":"no exceptions also,\nbecause torture does not stop."},"887":{"dur":4,"text":"No matter what,\nsome others will convince you of,"},"891":{"dur":6,"text":"there is no such thing as just a little\nbit, just a little, little bit of torture."},"897":{"dur":4,"text":"Of course, it used to be\nthe famous ticking time bomb case."},"901":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, it's the fictitious\nTerrorist mastermind, right?"},"905":{"dur":5,"text":"Who we have in custody and\nknow, with 100% certainty,"},"911":{"dur":5,"text":"that he is about to launch\na terrorist attack that we know,"},"916":{"dur":3,"text":"again with absolute certainty,\nis imminent."},"920":{"dur":5,"text":"So it's okay to torture him to get\nthe information to stop the attack."},"926":{"dur":4,"text":"When then surely it\nmust be okay to torture"},"931":{"dur":2,"text":"his presumed accomplice who\nknows where he's hiding, right?"},"934":{"dur":4,"text":"And must be okay to torture\nthe presumed accomplices"},"939":{"dur":4,"text":"spouse who knows where the accomplice is\nhiding who can lead us to the mastermind."},"943":{"dur":2,"text":"Someone who went to school with her."},"945":{"dur":3,"text":"Someone who went to the same\nMosque as the accomplice,"},"949":{"dur":2,"text":"from the same village as the mastermind."},"951":{"dur":0,"text":"You get it, right?"},"952":{"dur":4,"text":"And that I assure you, I'm not just making\nthat up, that is the reality of torture in"},"957":{"dur":4,"text":"every single Amnesty International\nreport for more than 50 years."},"961":{"dur":2,"text":"It does not stay confined."},"963":{"dur":1,"text":"It grows."},"965":{"dur":1,"text":"It extends."},"966":{"dur":1,"text":"It reaches further."},"967":{"dur":6,"text":"And further, that's what 600% more\ntorture in Mexico is all about."},"974":{"dur":5,"text":"So during the campaign, Amnesty here\nin Canada will be putting pressure on"},"979":{"dur":5,"text":"the Mexican government and on governments\nright around the world to reign it in."},"985":{"dur":2,"text":"To enact the safeguards that are needed."},"988":{"dur":3,"text":"But we're also going to have a lot to say,"},"991":{"dur":3,"text":"have already had a lot to\nsay to our own government."},"995":{"dur":0,"text":"Not because,"},"996":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm not trying to sess, suggest to you\nthat, you know, today February the 12th,"},"1000":{"dur":4,"text":"2015, Amnesty International said,\ntorture is rampant in Canada."},"1004":{"dur":0,"text":"No."},"1005":{"dur":4,"text":"Although, in a moment, I am going\nto highlight the shocking levels of"},"1009":{"dur":4,"text":"solitary confinement in Canadian

in Canadian prisons,"},"1023":{"dur":3,"text":"there is much that Canada can and\nmust do, nonetheless,"},"1027":{"dur":5,"text":"to significantly strengthen this\ncountry's contribution to ending torture."},"1032":{"dur":2,"text":"And I wanna take you\nthrough four general areas."},"1034":{"dur":5,"text":"The first is detention practices and\nconditions in Canada."},"1039":{"dur":2,"text":"The second is complicity\nin torture elsewhere."},"1042":{"dur":4,"text":"The third is justice and\nredress for torture."},"1046":{"dur":5,"text":"And the last is accountability and\noversight to avoid torture."},"1052":{"dur":4,"text":"So, let's begin by turning attention\nto the home front, and, as I say,"},"1056":{"dur":4,"text":"torture obviously in Canadian jails\nis not widespread and systematic."},"1060":{"dur":6,"text":"But there is one area where we absolutely\ndo have to use the words prisons,"},"1067":{"dur":3,"text":"Canada, and torture in the same breath."},"1070":{"dur":5,"text":"And that is the high use in\nCanada of solitary confinement,"},"1075":{"dur":2,"text":"which of course, we call something else."},"1078":{"dur":2,"text":"We call it administrative segregation."},"1080":{"dur":3,"text":"Hm, maybe with some hope that if\nyou call it something different,"},"1084":{"dur":2,"text":"it becomes something different,\nbut it doesn't."},"1087":{"dur":1,"text":"It is solitary confinement."},"1088":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's worth noting that solitary\nconfinement is an issue that has been"},"1093":{"dur":2,"text":"receiving increasing amounts of attention"},"1096":{"dur":3,"text":"within the international human\nrights system at UN level."},"1099":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's very notable."},"1101":{"dur":3,"text":"There was a breakthrough moment in 2011,\nwhen the world's,"},"1104":{"dur":5,"text":"when the UN's pre-eminent expert on\ntorture, the Special Rapporteur on torture"},"1110":{"dur":6,"text":"issued a new report all about this very\ntopic, solitary confinement as torture."},"1117":{"dur":4,"text":"And it was the first time that anyone at\nthat level with that sense of authority"},"1121":{"dur":5,"text":"and expertise had put the issue out in\nfront of governments, framed that way."},"1128":{"dur":2,"text":"And I want to, actually, there's two or\nthree times along the way here where I'm"},"1131":{"dur":3,"text":"gonna kind of do a vocabulary check\nwith you, and this is the first,"},"1134":{"dur":1,"text":"little asterisk here."},"1136":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's about the words\nsolitary confinement."},"1139":{"dur":2,"text":"Cuz I think we really have\nto stop here for a moment."},"1142":{"dur":4,"text":"I, I know that far too often, even within\nhuman rights discourse in human rights"},"1147":{"dur":4,"text":"activists in the community, we can be\na little bit dismissive, almost, of that."},"1151":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, okay, it's too bad."},"1154":{"dur":3,"text":"You must get kinda lonely,\nbeing held like that."},"1158":{"dur":5,"text":"But don't fully take ourselves to really\nunderstanding what is at stake here."},"1163":{"dur":4,"text":"And I just want to share one sentence\nfrom the Special Rapporteur's report."},"1168":{"dur":4,"text":"That I think quite powerfully underscores\nwhy we do need to think of this in"},"1173":{"dur":4,"text":"the same breath, absolutely as\nother vicious forms of torture."},"1178":{"dur":4,"text":"He begins by defining solitary\nconfinement as the physical and social"},"1182":{"dur":4,"text":"isolation of individuals who are confined\nto their cells for 22 to 24 hours a day."},"1187":{"dur":3,"text":"That, my friends,\nis administrative segregation in Canada."},"1191":{"dur":2,"text":"We're in the ballpark."},"1193":{"dur":3,"text":"And then,\nhere's how he highlights what's at stake."},"1198":{"dur":4,"text":"Being confined in isolation for\nthat duration produces severe, and"},"1202":{"dur":5,"text":"sometimes irreversible,\nphysical and psychological effects."},"1208":{"dur":4,"text":"Anxiety, depression, anger, intolerance\nof social

loneliness."},"1223":{"dur":5,"text":"And he concluded therefore,\nthat in many circumstances no matter what,"},"1229":{"dur":2,"text":"solitary confinement is torture."},"1231":{"dur":3,"text":"And in particular he's talking about\nwhen it's used against the young,"},"1235":{"dur":2,"text":"when it's used against people\nwith mental health problems."},"1237":{"dur":5,"text":"But he goes on to say that it is so\nsevere and serious and as he noted so"},"1243":{"dur":6,"text":"very, very often irreversible that\nthere absolute need to be limits."},"1250":{"dur":5,"text":"And that in his view
