actually, if you look back\nto when Larry and Sergey"},"108":{"dur":2,"text":"were at Stanford and building\nBackRub, which of course"},"111":{"dur":1,"text":"became Google."},"112":{"dur":4,"text":"That was all written in Python\nand using some fairly standard"},"117":{"dur":2,"text":"web serving tools and libraries,\nand they put the"},"120":{"dur":3,"text":"uniqueness that was\nGoogle on that."},"123":{"dur":3,"text":"So you had Python running on top\nof Linux, running on top"},"126":{"dur":2,"text":"of all kinds and

Python, and that was"},"147":{"dur":2,"text":"eventually Java and\nC and the rest."},"149":{"dur":5,"text":"And so we started with open\nsource in a lot of ways and"},"155":{"dur":3,"text":"built on

after that."},"228":{"dur":1,"text":"CHRIS DIBONA: Yeah, so if you\nlook at Hadoop, we published a"},"230":{"dur":3,"text":"paper back in 2000, I want to\nsay 2002 or 2003, about the"},"233":{"dur":3,"text":"Google File System which\nis called GFS."},"237":{"dur":4,"text":"And it inspired folks like Doug\nCutting to go out and"},"241":{"dur":2,"text":"write open

really\nhealthy."},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"And so you've seen a\nproliferation of these kinds"},"265":{"dur":6,"text":"of big data tools like MongoDB\nand Redis and LevelDB and all"},"271":{"dur":1,"text":"these really interesting\nlarge-scale key"},"273":{"dur":1,"text":"value stores and stuff."},"274":{"dur":5,"text":"And they have their roots in us\npublishing papers about our"},"280":{"dur":3,"text":"internal systems like BigTable\nand NGFS and"},"283":{"dur":1,"text":"Spanner and the rest."},"285":{"dur":4,"text":"DON DODGE: You mentioned\nChromium, Android, and some"},"289":{"dur":6,"text":"other pretty major open source\nproducts that Google has."},"296":{"dur":3,"text":"Are they licensed the same and\nthey are basically the same?"},"300":{"dur":2,"text":"Or are they quite different\nin how we handle them?"},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"CHRIS DIBONA: So Chromium\nand Android are"},"304":{"dur":1,"text":"actually quite different."},"306":{"dur":2,"text":"If you look at Chromium, when\nwe wrote it we really wanted"},"309":{"dur":4,"text":"to inspire other browser\nmanufacturers to, frankly, do"},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"what we do."},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we wanted to make it\npossible for them to actually"},"317":{"dur":1,"text":"use our code."},"318":{"dur":3,"text":"So beyond just contributing\nto WebKit, we also made a"},"322":{"dur":3,"text":"conscious decision to license\nChromium under BSD."},"326":{"dur":3,"text":"Because that code would then\nbe consumable by not just"},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"WebKit-based browsers, but also\nthose of them that might"},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"use Gecko, Mozilla."},"334":{"dur":3,"text":"Even Microsoft could take that\ncode and pull it into their"},"337":{"dur":3,"text":"browser or their software, and\nnot just learn, but actually"},"341":{"dur":1,"text":"just use what we're\npublishing."},"343":{"dur":1,"text":"Because when we shipped\nChromium--"},"344":{"dur":2,"text":"this is something a lot of\npeople don't understand-- when"},"347":{"dur":4,"text":"we first shipped to Chrome and\nChromium, this was a time when"},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"one tab getting slow would take\ndown your whole browser."},"354":{"dur":3,"text":"And we weren't really taking\nadvantage of the full"},"357":{"dur":3,"text":"capabilities of a modern\nCPU or modern hardware."},"361":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we really wanted to bring\nthat kind of processed"},"365":{"dur":3,"text":"isolation, and also the security\nin a sandbox to the"},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"browser so that people could\nfeel the browser was a safe"},"370":{"dur":3,"text":"place to work and to consume\ninformation."},"374":{"dur":3,"text":"So we tried to convince other\nbrowser manufacturers that"},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"this was really important."},"379":{"dur":4,"text":"And we decided that it was time\nto just do it, and do it"},"384":{"dur":3,"text":"in such a way that they could,\nif they ended up agreeing with"},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"us later, just adopt the work."},"389":{"dur":1,"text":"And we've been moderately\nsuccessful"},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"with that later mission."},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"But I think Chromium has been\nvery successful at showing"},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"that you can take real advantage\nof processed"},"398":{"dur":3,"text":"isolation and sandboxing to\nsecure a web browser."},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think that's really\nimportant, and people miss"},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, Android's a different\nstory together."},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"With Android, we licensed\nAndroid under the Apache"},"408":{"dur":4,"text":"license with the kernel being\nthe GPL Linux kernel."},"412":{"dur":3,"text":"And we chose Apache for\na number of reasons."},"415":{"dur":3,"text":"Apache has this really awesome\nlanguage around patents."},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"So it says, hey, if you're using\nour software and we have"},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"patents that read on that\nsoftware, we're not going to"},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"come and rent seek against\nyou for that software"},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"unless you sue us."},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you sue us, we're going\nto retain the rights to use"},"432":{"dur":4,"text":"those patents in the defense\nof our company against you."},"436":{"dur":3,"text":"But otherwise, we're telling you\nthat you have nothing to"},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"fear from Google and\nfrom using Android."},"444":{"dur":1,"text":"And that was a really big deal,\nand I think it really"},"446":{"dur":1,"text":"mattered with the carriers."},"447":{"dur":4,"text":"Also, Apache has this unusual\naspect to it in the world of"},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"open source where it says we\njust want you to acknowledge"},"454":{"dur":0,"text":"you're using it."},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"We don't need you to share\nyour source code, too."},"457":{"dur":5,"text":"And for the carriers who have\na lot of balls that they"},"463":{"dur":3,"text":"juggle in the air at one time,\nmaking compliance easier for"},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"them is very important."},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think it has a lot to do\nwith why Android is as popular"},"472":{"dur":4,"text":"as it is with so many\nmanufacturers, and you know"},"476":{"dur":1,"text":"that it's a real open\nsource project."},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"So companies will often\nsay hey, I've got"},"480":{"dur":0,"text":"this open source thing."},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"And then you'll see that they're\nthe only ones running"},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"it, and the only ones who\nwill ever run it."},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"And it comes down to trust,\nand it comes down to what"},"488":{"dur":1,"text":"license they use."},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"I think it's extremely telling\nthat when you look at a"},"492":{"dur":4,"text":"Kindle, or you look at a Nook,\nor you look at half a dozen"},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"Android-based devices\nthat don't have"},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"anything to do with Google."},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"That they continue to persistent\nand exist, because"},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"that's really open source."},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"We can't stop them, and\nnor do we want to."},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"But even if we wanted to, we\ncouldn't stop them from using"},"510":{"dur":0,"text":"the software."},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's how you know it's\nreally open source."},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"DON DODGE: So I sort of\nunderstand how open source"},"515":{"dur":1,"text":"works and what it is."},"517":{"dur":3,"text":"But I'm confused about this\njumble of licenses, there's an"},"521":{"dur":1,"text":"alphabet soup of licenses."},"522":{"dur":0,"text":"CHRIS DIBONA: You're\nnot alone."},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"DON DODGE: Can you say a little\nbit about what are the"},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"major licenses and\ndifferences?"},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"CHRIS DIBONA: Well, there's\nthree major"},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"categories of licenses."},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"There's what we call the\npermissive licenses, and they"},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"basically say, here's some\ncode, Don, enjoy it."},"537":{"dur":3,"text":"And all we really ask from you\nis that you mark in your about"},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"box or in your documentation\nthat you're using it."},"542":{"dur":0,"text":"So those are the"},"543":{"dur":1,"text":"permissive\/notification licenses."},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"DON DODGE: What are some\nexamples of the [INAUDIBLE]?"},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"CHRIS DIBONA: So that would be\nBSD, that would be Apache,"},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"MIT, ones like that."},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"And then there are the more\nshare alike style licenses."},"554":{"dur":4,"text":"And they say if I give my\nsoftware to Don and Don ships"},"559":{"dur":1,"text":"something, well, then\nhe's obligated to"},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"share his code, too."},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"For some definition of\nshare and use and all"},"565":{"dur":0,"text":"the rest, of course."},"566":{"dur":4,"text":"But those are your GPL licenses,\nyour LGPL licenses,"},"570":{"dur":5,"text":"and to a lesser degree the MPL\nlicenses as part of the"},"576":{"dur":1,"text":"Mozilla tri-license."},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"So depending on which one it is,\nyou'd either have to share"},"581":{"dur":3,"text":"more or less code, depending on\nhow you use that software."},"584":{"dur":4,"text":"And this stuff is deeply\nconfusing, so you shouldn't"},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"feel like you're ignorant\nof this stuff--"},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"almost everyone is."},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's not just a jobs program\nfor me and people like"},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"me, it's just complicated\nstuff."},"598":{"dur":4,"text":"Because these licenses, they\nsay how people feel about"},"602":{"dur":1,"text":"sharing their software."},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"And when you talk about\nfeelings, things get confusing"},"607":{"dur":1,"text":"and complicated."},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"And then the third category of\nlicenses are the ones that are"},"613":{"dur":6,"text":"trying to also define network\nperformance as being the kind"},"619":{"dur":3,"text":"of sharing that invokes the\nresharing of software."},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"So there are very few of these,\nand they're applied to"},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"very few actual pieces\nof software."},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"But it's a version of\nthe GPL called the"},"630":{"dur":3,"text":"Affero GPL, or the AGPL."},"633":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, for instance, we don't\nuse any AGPL software at"},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"Google and we don't\nallow it here."},"638":{"dur":1,"text":"And that would be like\nMongoDB, and"},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"RStudio and the rest."},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"And so in those cases, we either\npurchase a commercial"},"644":{"dur":3,"text":"license from those software\ncompanies or we simply don't"},"647":{"dur":0,"text":"allow them."},"648":{"dur":3,"text":"DON DODGE: So the AGPL, we\ndon't use that because--?"},"651":{"dur":4,"text":"CHRIS DIBONA: Because as it\ninteracts with other software"},"656":{"dur":3,"text":"and then is displayed on, say,\na google.com site or on a"},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"Gmail or apps site, we would\nthen have to share more"},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"software than we're comfortable\nsharing through"},"666":{"dur":1,"text":"the linking to that software."},"668":{"dur":5,"text":"DON DODGE: So if I'm a startup\nand I'm building my company,"},"673":{"dur":4,"text":"what do I need to look out for\nin terms of using open source?"},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"And which license should I have,\nand that kind of thing?"},"680":{"dur":3,"text":"CHRIS DIBONA: Well, except for\nthe AGPL, you pretty much"},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"don't have anything to worry\nabout as, say, a web startup."},"685":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're going to be shipping\nsoftware, that's a somewhat"},"688":{"dur":3,"text":"longer conversation where you\ntry to suss out what the"},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"startup wants to do, what\nthey're shipping, what they"},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"want to share."},"695":{"dur":3,"text":"Because open source is, in my\nmind, also a fundamental part"},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"of a developer relations\nstrategy"},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"and a developer ecosystem."},"702":{"dur":4,"text":"Without it you don't\nhave one, or it's a"},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"very unfair one, frankly."},"708":{"dur":4,"text":"So what I tell startups when I\nadvise them is that when you"},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"bring software into the company\nthat isn't written by"},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"someone at the company, and\nthat means anything--"},"718":{"dur":3,"text":"examples, software from places\nlike GitHub, or Stack"},"721":{"dur":4,"text":"Exchange, or Stack Overflow--"},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"you should always put these in\na special directory, like a"},"728":{"dur":1,"text":"third party directory."},"729":{"dur":1,"text":"This is what we do at\nGoogle, by the way."},"731":{"dur":0,"text":"We have millions of\nthese directories"},"732":{"dur":1,"text":"all over the place."},"733":{"dur":1,"text":"Segregate the code--"},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"you can absolutely,\nunconditionally still use it,"},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"you just want to keep it\nout in a special place."},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"DON DODGE: In your code base\nyou actually segregate the"},"743":{"dur":1,"text":"open source code and\nyou keep it there?"},"745":{"dur":0,"text":"CHRIS DIBONA: Yeah."},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"And so you have these third\nparty directories and then you"},"748":{"dur":4,"text":"call that code in whatever way\nyou see fit, but then at least"},"753":{"dur":1,"text":"you know where it is."},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"So there are other hygiene\nthings you can do, like make"},"757":{"dur":2,"text":"sure you only have one version\nof a specific library, even if"},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"it's used across multiple\nproducts."},"762":{"dur":1,"text":"Keeping up to date with security\n[INAUDIBLE], all"},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"these things that are\nfundamental to development."},"766":{"dur":3,"text":"But keeping things separate\nenough that you can keep on"},"770":{"dur":3,"text":"identifying it is\npretty amazing."},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"If you have that, you're\nbetter than 90% of the"},"776":{"dur":0,"text":"companies out there."},"777":{"dur":1,"text":"DON DODGE: So that's\nrule number one?"},"778":{"dur":2,"text":"CHRIS DIBONA: That's\nrule number one."},"781":{"dur":1,"text":"You have to be careful\nwith the AGPL."},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"So for instance, a lot of people\nreally like MongoDB"},"785":{"dur":3,"text":"right now for what it does, and\nthat makes perfect sense."},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you look at how MongoDB\nis licensed and the way they"},"791":{"dur":4,"text":"articulate that license,\nit's very clever."},"795":{"dur":5,"text":"They have very smart client\nlicensing, which basically"},"801":{"dur":4,"text":"doesn't transfer that network\nobligation onto a website."},"806":{"dur":4,"text":"But the database itself is\nsomething you have to, if you"},"811":{"dur":1,"text":"make improvements to the\ndatabase, if you have certain"},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"code interacting with the\ndatabase in certain ways, that"},"815":{"dur":0,"text":"code may end up being shared."},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"So you'll just want to know that\nwhen you're using tools"},"819":{"dur":2,"text":"like MongoDB."},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"Magento is another really\npopular shopping cart"},"823":{"dur":1,"text":"application."},"825":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's not unfair to say\nthat this drives a lot of"},"830":{"dur":3,"text":"license revenue to Magento and\nMongoDB, and it's fair and"},"833":{"dur":0,"text":"this is their deal."},"834":{"dur":1,"text":"They're saying listen, we want\nyou to use this stuff."},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"But if you use it in certain\nways, you should be paying us."},"838":{"dur":1,"text":"And so that's a commercial\nsoftware license that you"},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"would get from them."},"843":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's the sort of thing we\nsee in acquisitions actually"},"845":{"dur":1,"text":"quite a bit."},"846":{"dur":1,"text":"DON DODGE: Good point."},"847":{"dur":3,"text":"You also review acquisitions\nfor Google."},"851":{"dur":2,"text":"Every time Google does an\nacquisition, you look at the"},"853":{"dur":3,"text":"code and look for open source,\nmake sure it's licensed."},"856":{"dur":1,"text":"So say a little bit about what\nyou do in that process."},"858":{"dur":2,"text":"CHRIS DIBONA: Yeah, so for\ninstance, suppose you're a"},"861":{"dur":2,"text":"startup that does something\nwith video."},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"You're probably using FFmpeg,\nyou're probably using it with"},"866":{"dur":1,"text":"certain compile flags."},"867":{"dur":1,"text":"And most people don't even\nknow this, by the way."},"869":{"dur":2,"text":"At this point, by the time I\nsay compile flags, it means"},"871":{"dur":2,"text":"there's a developer inside that\norganization who built"},"874":{"dur":1,"text":"that piece of software."},"875":{"dur":3,"text":"And I can actually tell from\nthe output that I, the"},"879":{"dur":3,"text":"consumer, can see pretty\nmuch what you've done."},"882":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's very easy for me to say,\nOK, you're probably using"},"884":{"dur":0,"text":"this, this, and this."},"885":{"dur":1,"text":"And they're like, who told\nyou what we're using?"},"886":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's like, we know."},"889":{"dur":2,"text":"We've seen a million startups\nlike this, and so here's what"},"892":{"dur":3,"text":"you'll have to do to be\ncompliant with these licenses."},"895":{"dur":2,"text":"So we have that discussion a\nlot with companies, by deal"},"898":{"dur":1,"text":"close you have to\ndo X, Y, and Z."},"899":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's funny, when I was\nyounger and maybe more"},"904":{"dur":3,"text":"idealistic or less cynical, I\nwould say, I can't believe"},"907":{"dur":1,"text":"these people are breaking\nlicenses in such"},"909":{"dur":1,"text":"a fundamental way."},"910":{"dur":3,"text":"But what it is is most people's\nintentions are pure."},"913":{"dur":2,"text":"They just don't know how to be\ncompliant with these licenses,"},"916":{"dur":2,"text":"and sometimes it's actually\ndeeply complicated."},"918":{"dur":2,"text":"So oftentimes when we see\nacquisitions come in, we'll"},"921":{"dur":2,"text":"say, OK, if you want to keep\nshipping this piece of"},"923":{"dur":2,"text":"software, you have to do X and\nY and Z. And you've been"},"925":{"dur":3,"text":"shipping this piece of software\nfor this long, so"},"928":{"dur":1,"text":"you'll need to do this."},"929":{"dur":3,"text":"So that people who want their\nrights under the open source"},"933":{"dur":3,"text":"licenses which you have chosen\nto use are going to be able to"},"936":{"dur":1,"text":"be satisfied."},"938":{"dur":1,"text":"Because we
