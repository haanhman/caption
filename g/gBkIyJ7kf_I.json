way."},"23":{"dur":3,"text":"My favorite quote \nabout categorizing people"},"26":{"dur":2,"text":"comes from the comedian George Carlin."},"29":{"dur":3,"text":"He said there are three kinds of people:"},"32":{"dur":3,"text":"those who can count and those who cannot."},"36":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"38":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm glad you got that."},"39":{"dur":2,"text":"(Laughter)"},"41":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, I want to talk about a positive way\nof categorizing people."},"45":{"dur":2,"text":"It's called personality type,"},"48":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's based on something called\nthe Myers-Briggs Type Indicator,"},"51":{"dur":2,"text":"or MBTI Assessment."},"53":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm just going to be able to give you\na little bit of that framework."},"58":{"dur":3,"text":"There's a lot more to it\nthan I'm going to get to today."},"62":{"dur":5,"text":"So, what this is about is it's about\nhow you prefer to gain energy,"},"68":{"dur":5,"text":"gather information, make decisions\nand live your life."},"73":{"dur":6,"text":"Now, this word \"preference\" is a really\nimportant thing in this system."},"79":{"dur":4,"text":"So I just want to do a quick demonstration\nof what preference happens to be."},"84":{"dur":3,"text":"So, let's say you're really skeptical\nabout personality type"},"88":{"dur":3,"text":"and you cross your arms\nand maybe you even tap your foot."},"91":{"dur":3,"text":"Just try that with me, if you would, okay?"},"94":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, you probably didn't even think,\n\"Which arm do I put on top?\""},"98":{"dur":4,"text":"You have a natural preference\nfor how you cross your arms."},"103":{"dur":2,"text":"So, try crossing them in the other way."},"105":{"dur":5,"text":"You can do it, easily.\nIt doesn't feel quite as natural."},"110":{"dur":3,"text":"And we're going to be talking\nabout personality preferences"},"114":{"dur":1,"text":"within ourselves,"},"115":{"dur":5,"text":"and they're really natural habits,\nnatural mental habits that you have,"},"121":{"dur":4,"text":"for the ways you might like\nto think, or do, or act."},"126":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, I think it's helpful to know\nabout personality type for two reasons."},"130":{"dur":2,"text":"One is, it can help you understand"},"133":{"dur":5,"text":"that that other person is not really\ntrying to drive you crazy on purpose."},"138":{"dur":3,"text":"They just see the world\nin a different way than you do."},"142":{"dur":4,"text":"And the second reason is it can help you\nunderstand more about yourself,"},"147":{"dur":2,"text":"about things that come \nmore easily for you,"},"149":{"dur":2,"text":"things that might take\na little bit more time,"},"152":{"dur":2,"text":"that might be a little bit more difficult,"},"154":{"dur":3,"text":"so that you can forgive yourself\nwhen you're not perfect."},"158":{"dur":3,"text":"But that doesn't\nexcuse yourself from trying."},"161":{"dur":3,"text":"So, let's start in on this framework."},"165":{"dur":1,"text":"When I was growing up,"},"167":{"dur":6,"text":"I thought family togetherness was\neveryone in the same room reading a book."},"174":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm an extrovert, I grew up\nin a family of introverts."},"178":{"dur":4,"text":"My mother thought that my siblings\nneeded to go to nursery school"},"183":{"dur":1,"text":"and I didn't."},"184":{"dur":1,"text":"It probably should have been reverse."},"186":{"dur":4,"text":"They needed their quiet time and I would\nhave had fun with those other kids."},"191":{"dur":2,"text":"I can assure you \nwe're all just fine today."},"193":{"dur":1,"text":"(Chuckling)"},"195":{"dur":2,"text":"So, this is the first\nwhat we call preference pair,"},"197":{"dur":4,"text":"and it has to do with where we direct\nand receive our energy."},"202":{"dur":2,"text":"There's an extroverted way\nand an introverted way."},"205":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, these are not social skills."},"208":{"dur":2,"text":"You can have people\nwho prefer extroversion"},"210":{"dur":3,"text":"and people who prefer\nintroversion who are shy."},"214":{"dur":1,"text":"This is about energy."},"216":{"dur":3,"text":"So, extroverts want \ntheir energy to go out"},"219":{"dur":3,"text":"and, when it goes out,\nthey're with people, they're doing things,"},"222":{"dur":2,"text":"it comes bouncing back to them."},"225":{"dur":3,"text":"And introverts want \ntheir energy to go in."},"229":{"dur":5,"text":"By looking at ideas, impressions,\nfacts inside their head,"},"234":{"dur":3,"text":"they create more energy."},"237":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, I need to do a quick aside\non this idea of preference pairs."},"242":{"dur":2,"text":"We believe that you have both within you."},"244":{"dur":3,"text":"It's just that you prefer\none over the other."},"248":{"dur":3,"text":"It really does not guarantee\njust because you prefer something"},"252":{"dur":1,"text":"that you're good at it."},"253":{"dur":3,"text":"You might need to develop skills with it\nand, while you're at it,"},"257":{"dur":2,"text":"develop skills with the other preference."},"259":{"dur":1,"text":"That's going to be helpful"},"261":{"dur":5,"text":"because there are times when you need\nto flex and act in a different way."},"266":{"dur":3,"text":"If you just do everything\naccording to your preferences,"},"269":{"dur":2,"text":"it's not going to always work."},"273":{"dur":3,"text":"So, when we look\nat extroversion and introversion"},"276":{"dur":4,"text":"and how it appears in meetings,\nit's kind of interesting."},"281":{"dur":4,"text":"So, extroverts in a meeting are more\nlikely to be talking their ideas out."},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"If I bring it out, it becomes real,"},"288":{"dur":3,"text":"and I may start over here\nand end up over here,"},"291":{"dur":3,"text":"because I've made it real\nas I'm talking it out."},"294":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, the introvert listening\nto that extrovert may be thinking,"},"297":{"dur":3,"text":"\"If they just shut up,\nwe would get somewhere.\""},"302":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, they don't understand\nextroversion is about bringing it out."},"306":{"dur":4,"text":"So, our introverts are taking things in\nduring that meeting,"},"311":{"dur":1,"text":"they're mulling it through,"},"313":{"dur":3,"text":"and our extrovert looking\nat them is probably going,"},"316":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Are they awake? \nAre they listening to me?\""},"319":{"dur":4,"text":"And we assume that they are\nbecause they're working it out inside."},"324":{"dur":4,"text":"Silences for extroverts\nare space to be filled."},"328":{"dur":4,"text":"Silences for introverts\nare space to be cherished."},"333":{"dur":1,"text":"When we think about interruptions,"},"334":{"dur":3,"text":"there's also a different way\nthat people may look at that."},"338":{"dur":4,"text":"Interruptions for extroverts\nactually may be compliments:"},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Gee, someone's listened \nto what I've said!"},"345":{"dur":3,"text":"They want to jump right in,\nyou know, build on my idea.\""},"348":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a compliment."},"350":{"dur":4,"text":"But, for an introvert,\nthat same interruption may be rude:"},"355":{"dur":1,"text":"\"I've thought about it inside,"},"357":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm bringing up my ideas,\nyou're interrupting me."},"360":{"dur":4,"text":"I need to stop and think, 'Is that\nnew information or is it a pure dribble?,'"},"364":{"dur":3,"text":"and then I'm going\nto continue with my talk.\""},"370":{"dur":4,"text":"Introverts, by the way,\nonce they know people and topics well,"},"374":{"dur":4,"text":"will act like extroverts\nbecause they've done their inside work."},"379":{"dur":3,"text":"We say that, if you want to know\nwhat an extrovert is thinking,"},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"you haven't been listening."},"385":{"dur":4,"text":"If you want to know\nwhat an introvert is thinking,"},"389":{"dur":1,"text":"you haven't asked."},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"So, now I want to go on to the next one,"},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"which is how we gather data"},"397":{"dur":3,"text":"and the kind of information\nwe like and trust."},"401":{"dur":3,"text":"The preference pairs here\nare sensing and intuition."},"404":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, I happen to prefer sensing."},"407":{"dur":4,"text":"I like things to be\npractical, actual, real."},"411":{"dur":5,"text":"I just really want to get down\nto the here and now of what's going on."},"417":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, by contrast,"},"418":{"dur":5,"text":"intuitive types like possibilities,\nmeanings, the big picture,"},"423":{"dur":5,"text":"and I want to show you a picture\nthat gets at some of these differences."},"429":{"dur":5,"text":"So, if we look at this particular picture\nwith a sensing lens,"},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"we may see pillars,\ntrees, yellow flowers,"},"438":{"dur":3,"text":"there's an umbrella \nin there, and so forth."},"441":{"dur":4,"text":"If we look at this picture\nfrom an intuitive point of view,"},"445":{"dur":3,"text":"we might see an ancient lost civilization,"},"449":{"dur":4,"text":"where the wild things are,\nor a ballet of dancing trees."},"454":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, we both looked at the same picture."},"457":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I use this in a community\nleadership program"},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"and we get people into sensing groups\nand intuitive groups"},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"and have them look\nat this picture and talk about it."},"467":{"dur":3,"text":"We had a civil engineer once\nwho pointed over to -"},"471":{"dur":1,"text":"he was in the sensing group -"},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"he pointed to the\nintuitive group and he said,"},"475":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Hum, I always thought they were liars."},"479":{"dur":4,"text":"I would go to a community meeting\nand present my facts."},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"I would see them a couple of days later"},"487":{"dur":3,"text":"and they said I said things\nI know I didn't say."},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"Our memories are just fine."},"492":{"dur":4,"text":"So, now I know I need\nto sit down with them"},"497":{"dur":5,"text":"and find out how they got from my facts\nto what they're interpreting.\""},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"So, it's very important,\nyou can miss one another."},"505":{"dur":4,"text":"You're seeing the same picture,\nbut you're seeing different things."},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"If we look at well-known figures,"},"512":{"dur":5,"text":"we can also start to think about what lens\ndo they see the world with."},"517":{"dur":3,"text":"So, let's take Thomas Edison."},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"He's the guy who invented\nthe light bulb, remember,"},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"by putting all those little filaments in"},"526":{"dur":3,"text":"and keeping checking\nhundreds of them, probably."},"529":{"dur":6,"text":"He's been known to have said,\n\"[Genius] is 99% perspiration.\""},"536":{"dur":4,"text":"He probably saw the world\nthrough a sensing lens."},"540":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, if we look at Albert Einstein,\nwith his theory of relativity,"},"546":{"dur":5,"text":"he said, \"Not all that counts\ncan be counted.\""},"551":{"dur":4,"text":"He probably sees the world\nthrough an intuitive lens."},"556":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, once you have information in,\nyou need to figure out what to do with it,"},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"and that leads us\nto the third preference pair:"},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"thinking and feeling."},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, I know that I'm a thinking type."},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"I look at the world in a logical way."},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"People come to me with a problem,"},"575":{"dur":4,"text":"I want to get to the bottom line\nand help them solve it now."},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"But I realized there are some people,\nwhen they come to me"},"582":{"dur":4,"text":"they just want me to stop and listen\nand support them."},"588":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, I learned that I need\nto sort of step back and ask people,"},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"at least I remember that \nsome of the time,"},"595":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Do you want me just to listen,"},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"or do you want me\nto help solve the problem?,\""},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"because then I don't get so annoyed\nif they don't take my advice."},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"So, in this decision-making system,"},"605":{"dur":3,"text":"thinking types step back \nfrom the decision."},"609":{"dur":4,"text":"They look at the data that they have,\nthe information that they have,"},"613":{"dur":3,"text":"in an objective way."},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"They look at the pros,\nthey look at the cons,"},"620":{"dur":1,"text":"they make their decision."},"621":{"dur":3,"text":"But feeling types step into the decision."},"625":{"dur":4,"text":"They become aware of,\n\"How is this going to impact people?"},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"How does this fit with my value system?,\""},"632":{"dur":3,"text":"and they're looking for harmony\nwith their value system."},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"Now you probably \nalready figured out here"},"638":{"dur":5,"text":"that feeling does not mean\nmaking decisions based on emotions."},"643":{"dur":5,"text":"There is a structured way\nof using the values and the harmony."},"649":{"dur":4,"text":"So, if we think about\nthe definition of being fair,"},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"we may see some different things."},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"For thinking types,"},"658":{"dur":5,"text":"being fair means treating everyone\naccording to the same standards,"},"664":{"dur":2,"text":"or treating people equally."},"666":{"dur":1,"text":"For feeling types,"},"667":{"dur":4,"text":"being fair means treating everyone\naccording to what they need;"},"672":{"dur":4,"text":"individuals are different,\nthey need different things."},"677":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, I want to do another\nlittle experiment with you"},"680":{"dur":3,"text":"that I sometimes do\nwith my training groups"},"683":{"dur":3,"text":"and let's say you're working on a project."},"687":{"dur":3,"text":"This hand represents\ncompleting the project."},"690":{"dur":4,"text":"This hand represents I'm starting,\nI'm part-way through and I'm done."},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I typically ask thinking types,"},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Tell me when you want someone"},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"to give you some\nappreciation or recognition"},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"for your work on that project.\""},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"And my hand will move along"},"706":{"dur":3,"text":"and finally, when I get to the end,\nthey've finished the project,"},"709":{"dur":1,"text":"they will say, \"Now.\""},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'll ask them, \"So, what happens"},"713":{"dur":6,"text":"if someone gives you some recognition\nearlier in that work?\""},"719":{"dur":5,"text":"And they say, \"Well, I'm a little worried.\nI think I'm working for an idiot."},"725":{"dur":4,"text":"They have no sense of standards\nand what is good work.\""},"730":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, I ask feeling types the same thing,"},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"\"When do you want recognition\non that project?,\""},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"and they call out,\n\"Now, now, now, now, now.\""},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"741":{"dur":1,"text":"All the way through."},"743":{"dur":1,"text":"\"So, what does that look like?\""},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm a thinking type,\nI'm waiting till I'm done."},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"They say like, \"Well,\nit can be things like, 'Good start!,'"},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"or, 'Gee, you had some great ideas here.'\""},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, I ask the feeling types,\n\"So, what happens"},"756":{"dur":4,"text":"if someone gives you some recognition -\nif they wait until the end?\""},"760":{"dur":3,"text":"And they say, \"Well,\nI think that they don't care,"},"764":{"dur":3,"text":"and if they don't care about me,\nthey don't care about my work,"},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"and it affects my morale.\""},"770":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, both thinking types and feeling types\ncan come to the exact same conclusions."},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"They just do it in different ways."},"777":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's really helpful for thinking types\nto remember to always ask,"},"781":{"dur":3,"text":"\"How would this logically impact people?,\""},"784":{"dur":6,"text":"and for feeling types to always ask,\n\"What's the most important thing here?\""},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"But we need to move on."},"792":{"dur":5,"text":"Our last one has to do with how we like\nto go about living our lives."},"797":{"dur":3,"text":"And our words are \"judging\"\nand \"perceiving\" in this preference pair,"},"801":{"dur":3,"text":"and \"judging\" here\ndoesn't mean \"judgmental.\""},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"But what judging types like to do\nis organize things,"},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"make decisions, get on with it,"},"810":{"dur":3,"text":"and perceiving types\nlike to kind of go with the flow"},"814":{"dur":4,"text":"and be spontaneous\nand continue gathering information."},"818":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I'll admit, I'm a judging type,\nI love to make lists,"},"823":{"dur":2,"text":"I love to check off things from the list"},"826":{"dur":4,"text":"and I've even been known to put things\non the list I've already done"},"831":{"dur":2,"text":"for the sheer joy of checking them
