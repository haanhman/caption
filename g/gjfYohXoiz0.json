materials,"},"41":{"dur":4,"text":"that you can use together\nto make things invisible."},"46":{"dur":4,"text":"So, what is the challenge of invisibility?"},"51":{"dur":3,"text":"To paint something black is not enough,\nthat's the first thing to say."},"55":{"dur":4,"text":"Conventional stealth, as used\nto make aircraft invisible to radar"},"59":{"dur":1,"text":"is just making them

you want\nto make something invisible,"},"74":{"dur":4,"text":"like Peter Pan, you've got\nto lose your shadow."},"79":{"dur":5,"text":"So, let me explain how we try to do that\nthrough an analogy with water."},"85":{"dur":5,"text":"If you put a stone in a stream, the water\nnaturally flows around the [stone],"},"91":{"dur":3,"text":"and the flow of water\nwill close up behind the stone,"},"94":{"dur":3,"text":"so that somebody downstream of the stone"},"97":{"dur":3,"text":"will see smoothly flowing water\nand will not know the stone is there."},"101":{"dur":2,"text":"In the

invisible"},"118":{"dur":3,"text":"through that technique."},"123":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, somebody who had a lot to say\nabout light was Albert Einstein;"},"128":{"dur":6,"text":"and we are going to use some of his work\nto inspire us how to create invisibility."},"134":{"dur":6,"text":"Now, he had a theory of gravity"},"141":{"dur":1,"text":"which was revolutionary."},"143":{"dur":4,"text":"And he said gravity acts through\nchanging the properties of space."},"147":{"dur":5,"text":"Einstein regarded space as a material,\nalmost as if it was made of rubber"},"153":{"dur":4,"text":"and very massive objects\ncould stretch or compress that rubber,"},"157":{"dur":4,"text":"and if space was distorted,\nthen objects moving through it"},"162":{"dur":2,"text":"no longer travelled in a straight

it,"},"173":{"dur":4,"text":"then light also must not\nmove in a straight line."},"178":{"dur":3,"text":"And this was a very controversial\naspect of his theory"},"181":{"dur":5,"text":"because Newton said that gravity \nacts between two massive objects."},"187":{"dur":4,"text":"But what Einstein was saying: \"Only one\nof the objects needs to be massive.\""},"191":{"dur":3,"text":"And light is a mass-less object,\nbut, according to Einstein,"},"195":{"dur":2,"text":"is still affected by gravity."},"198":{"dur":3,"text":"And it was Arthur Stanley\nEddington's experiment"},"201":{"dur":4,"text":"of seeing the bending of light around\nthe Sun, during a solar eclipse"},"206":{"dur":2,"text":"that is one of the foundation stones"},"208":{"dur":4,"text":"of Einstein's general\ntheory of relativity."},"213":{"dur":5,"text":"These days, astronomers routinely see\nwhat they call \"gravitational lensing.\""},"219":{"dur":3,"text":"This is a picture from\nthe Hubble Telescope,"},"223":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's a picture of a red galaxy."},"227":{"dur":5,"text":"Behind that galaxy is another\nsecond galaxy, which is emitting light,"},"232":{"dur":3,"text":"and the light, as it comes\nnear the first galaxy,"},"236":{"dur":4,"text":"is bent in its gravitational field;\nit's flowing like water,"},"241":{"dur":4,"text":"and that's what's producing this\nring of light around the first galaxy."},"246":{"dur":1,"text":"It's light that has been bent,"},"247":{"dur":5,"text":"gravitationally lensed\nby the [first]

light."},"264":{"dur":4,"text":"Because what Einstein also showed\nwas that the effects produced"},"268":{"dur":3,"text":"by bending or stretching space"},"272":{"dur":4,"text":"are equivalent to a material\nwith a certain refractive index."},"277":{"dur":6,"text":"So you could use all this fancy\nmetric technology that Einstein had,"},"283":{"dur":3,"text":"you could say what sort of space\nwould do this bending,"},"286":{"dur":4,"text":"and then you say, \"Well, hey,\nI don't need to create a space like that."},"290":{"dur":4,"text":"I just need a material with \na refractive index which is related"},"294":{"dur":0,"text":"to the space.\""},"295":{"dur":5,"text":"But we're going to use Einstein's\nthoughts as our design process."},"301":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, we all know\nthat materials do refract light,"},"306":{"dur":3,"text":"and here's a block of glass bending light,"},"309":{"dur":4,"text":"but it does so at its surface,\nvery, very sharply."},"314":{"dur":4,"text":"But we don't want to do that, we want\nto do something more sophisticated:"},"318":{"dur":4,"text":"we're going to have to make the light\nbend continuously, rather than suddenly,"},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"and that means not a sudden change\nin the refractive index,"},"325":{"dur":1,"text":"but a smooth change."},"326":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's going to be difficult,"},"328":{"dur":4,"text":"and I'll explain how we get around\nsome of those difficulties in a moment."},"333":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, how do we design a cloak?"},"337":{"dur":6,"text":"Well, we start with a sphere -- and inside\nthat sphere is just ordinary space --"},"345":{"dur":3,"text":"and inside that sphere\nI'm going to create a cloak,"},"348":{"dur":4,"text":"and inside the cloak a hiding space,\nwhere I'm going to hide something"},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"that will be invisible."},"356":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I go inside the sphere and --"},"360":{"dur":3,"text":"space is made of rubber,\nyou can stretch it --"},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"and I make a hole in this rubber space,"},"366":{"dur":5,"text":"and I push the space into an annulus\ncontained within the sphere"},"371":{"dur":5,"text":"and create inside that that hole:\na space where I can hide something."},"377":{"dur":4,"text":"And I push all the space\ninto this annulus, clear it out."},"381":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, if light happens to be\ngoing through the sphere,"},"384":{"dur":3,"text":"the light behaves as if\nit's embedded in the rubber,"},"388":{"dur":5,"text":"so that when you push the rubber\nspace away, you take the light with it,"},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"you clear all the light out\nof that central region;"},"395":{"dur":3,"text":"so now no light gets there,\nand anything in there cannot be seen"},"399":{"dur":1,"text":"because no light can reach it."},"401":{"dur":4,"text":"Conversely, it cannot send\nany light out either."},"407":{"dur":3,"text":"But, although we've stretched space"},"411":{"dur":3,"text":"and done severe damage to it\ninside this sphere,"},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"and moved the light around considerably,"},"417":{"dur":5,"text":"what we haven't done is interfere\nwith space outside that sphere."},"423":{"dur":5,"text":"And if you don't move the space,\nthen you don't move the light,"},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"which is stuck inside it."},"431":{"dur":4,"text":"And so you achiev this objective\nof creating no shadow"},"435":{"dur":4,"text":"because the light outside doesn't know\nwhat's going on inside the sphere."},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"There's no change."},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"And therefore, if you try\nto look at the sphere,"},"444":{"dur":4,"text":"in which all this nonsense is going on,\nyou would actually see through it."},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"You would see what was behind the sphere."},"452":{"dur":4,"text":"And so what is happening\nis that, just as we wished,"},"457":{"dur":5,"text":"the light is moving\nin a smooth curve, flowing like water."},"462":{"dur":4,"text":"And then we can say, \"Well, what are the\nproperties of this compressed space?"},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"What is the effective refractive index"},"469":{"dur":4,"text":"that Einstein's theory would say\nwould have the same effect?\""},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"And that is the material property we want."},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"Unfortunately, we're not\ndone at that stage,"},"479":{"dur":5,"text":"because in nature, we very rarely find\nthe materials we need for a cloak."},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"There are exceptions which I'll come to,"},"488":{"dur":3,"text":"but at this stage we have to\nintroduce new materials,"},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"they're called metamaterials,\nand they work like this:"},"495":{"dur":4,"text":"So an ordinary material, the way\nit refracts light is due to its chemistry."},"499":{"dur":3,"text":"So that if you wish to change\nthe properties of glass,"},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"you put some lead in it,\nyou make lead crystal,"},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"and that is great for making\nreally sparkly wine glasses."},"508":{"dur":3,"text":"But there's another way you can change\nthe properties of glass:"},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"you can make very, very tiny holes in it."},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"They have to be very tiny because\nif they're big, you'd see them,"},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"and you would know there are\nholes there, but if very tiny,"},"519":{"dur":3,"text":"the effect of the holes\nis to make the light less dense,"},"523":{"dur":3,"text":"to make the glass less dense, excuse me."},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"And that makes it less refracting."},"528":{"dur":4,"text":"So you can actually change the properties\nof glass by making these tiny holes;"},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"much less than the wavelength,\nso you can't see them,"},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"but they do alterate\nrefracting properties."},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll give you an extreme example of that:"},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"If you take silver, you can\nmake a plate of silver,"},"545":{"dur":3,"text":"and if you polish it very, very smoothly,\nit makes one of the best mirrors"},"549":{"dur":1,"text":"that there can be."},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"It's very highly reflecting."},"552":{"dur":3,"text":"Do something else to it: cut it up \ninto little nano-spheres,"},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"make a colloid out of it, and it's\nthe blackest substance known."},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"You've probably seen some of it."},"563":{"dur":4,"text":"Have you ever seen a black and white\nphotographic negative?"},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"The black stuff is silver colloid."},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"So just by changing the structure --\nit's still silver in there --"},"573":{"dur":4,"text":"just by changing the structure\nyou can have this extreme effect"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"on the way it reacts to light."},"579":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's this extra dimension\nof design of changing the structure,"},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"which we use in metamaterials,"},"586":{"dur":3,"text":"enables us to have access\nto all sort of remarkable properties,"},"590":{"dur":4,"text":"only some of which I have time\nto talk about today, in invisibility."},"595":{"dur":4,"text":"So, using this design tool,\nwhich Einstein is presented with,"},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"and these metamaterials, which\nwe have developed here in London,"},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"David Smith, at Duke University,"},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"who has been a very \nintimate part of this story,"},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"built a cloak in 2006."},"610":{"dur":5,"text":"His cloak was for radar waves,\nmaking objects invisible to radars,"},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"but the principles\nare the same for visible light."},"619":{"dur":5,"text":"But I shall pass lightly\nover David's cloak,"},"625":{"dur":6,"text":"because I'm sure what you'd rather\nhear about is invisibility to light,"},"631":{"dur":1,"text":"as we do it."},"634":{"dur":4,"text":"And a similar strategy was followed"},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"by Shuang Zhang's team in Birmingham"},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"working with Jensen Li."},"645":{"dur":4,"text":"And what they chose to do\nwas to hide something on a mirror"},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"by making a little tunnel in the mirror."},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"So they lifted the surface of the mirror"},"655":{"dur":4,"text":"and they made a tent, or a tunnel,\nin which you could hide something."},"659":{"dur":4,"text":"And of course, if that's all you do,\nyou know that it's a hiding place"},"663":{"dur":5,"text":"because those little facets of the tunnel\nwill be very visible from outside."},"670":{"dur":4,"text":"So, their cloak was designed\nto have the function"},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"of making the mirror look\nas though it was flat."},"677":{"dur":3,"text":"So although the mirror has a kink in it\nand you're hiding something,"},"680":{"dur":4,"text":"if you look at it through the cloak\nfrom outside, it should appear flat."},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"And how did they do that design?"},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, this slide shows you\nhow they did it."},"689":{"dur":3,"text":"So once again, you start\nwith some ordinary space,"},"693":{"dur":4,"text":"it's contained in a triangle\nwhich sits on a mirror;"},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"and then you lift\nthe surface of the mirror,"},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"to make your tunnel, or tent,"},"703":{"dur":4,"text":"and as you do so, you compress \nthe space into the triangle."},"708":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, instead of ordinary space, you've got\ntwo regions of compressed space."},"713":{"dur":4,"text":"And then you say -- you have got\nsome compressed space --"},"718":{"dur":3,"text":"what's the material property, \nwhat's the refractive index"},"722":{"dur":5,"text":"that reproduces the effect\nof that compressed space?"},"728":{"dur":1,"text":"And it turns out in this case"},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"that if you get those angles\nof the triangles just right,"},"732":{"dur":1,"text":"you can find a natural material"},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"and that natural material\nis called calcite."},"738":{"dur":5,"text":"And if you have contacts in China,\nyou can get huge crystals of calcite"},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"and this cloak is about\nten centimetres across."},"747":{"dur":3,"text":"And on the right-hand side there you see,\nI'm afraid, a rather smudgy picture"},"751":{"dur":3,"text":"of the Birmingham calcite cloak."},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"So, they had a rather ingenious way"},"759":{"dur":4,"text":"of explaining how their cloak works:"},"763":{"dur":4,"text":"so they looked at the alphabet\nthrough the mirror."},"768":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, if you didn't cloak this tent,\nbecause the mirror has a kink in it,"},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"you couldn't see\nthe middle bit of the alphabet."},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"So on the left, you see\na picture of the alphabet"},"778":{"dur":3,"text":"viewed through the mirror,\nwithout the cloak."},"781":{"dur":3,"text":"And as you can read,\nthe middle bit is missing."},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, they put\nthe calcite crystals in place,"},"787":{"dur":1,"text":"they should make the mirror look flat,"},"789":{"dur":3,"text":"you should be able to see\nall the alphabet, and you can."},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"H, I, J, K, L."},"795":{"dur":4,"text":"And by the way, there's some controversy\nabout whether cloaks can cloak all colors"},"800":{"dur":1,"text":"at the same time."},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"This is a real photograph\ntaken in white light."},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"So you can just see little fringes of red"},"807":{"dur":4,"text":"on the end, but it's a broadband cloak."},"812":{"dur":4,"text":"Now before I finish, I want to tell you\nabout some aspects of this work,"},"817":{"dur":3,"text":"which I think are equally important."},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"We've touched the hem of the great,"},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"we've borrowed\nsome of Einstein's theories,"},"825":{"dur":5,"text":"and that adds some sophistication\nto our work, I think."},"831":{"dur":1,"text":"We've also had a lot of fun,"},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"because designing a cloak\ninterests lot of people,"},"836":{"dur":3,"text":"and I have the chance to talk\nto audiences like this."},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"But also, at the end of the day,"},"843":{"dur":3,"text":"these ideas, these design tools,"},"846":{"dur":2,"text":"these materials,\nhave practical applications."},"849":{"dur":3,"text":"I have just time to tell you about\nthree of them very briefly."},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"One of them is being worked on here"},"854":{"dur":3,"text":"in the Electrical Engineering\nDepartment, by Richard Syms,"},"858":{"dur":5,"text":"and is a way of making magnetic resonance\nimaging scans more efficient."},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"He has designed a wire,"},"865":{"dur":4,"text":"which, instead of transporting\nelectricity, transports magnetism."},"869":{"dur":4,"text":"Of course, magnetic resonance imaging \nworks through a magnetic signal,"},"874":{"dur":4,"text":"so that's a way of making\nMRI more efficient."},"878":{"dur":5,"text":"Another application, which is leading\nto a start-up company funded by Bill Gates"},"884":{"dur":2,"text":"in Seattle,"},"887":{"dur":3,"text":"is replacing satellite\ncommunication receivers,"},"891":{"dur":5,"text":"which, at the moment, consist of a rather\nbig dish, 30 centimeters across,"},"896":{"dur":2,"text":"because you need to point that dish"},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"at the satellite and the dish\nhas to be steerable,"},"901":{"dur":3,"text":"so it's heavy, it's expensive,\nit takes power."},"906":{"dur":3,"text":"And you can
