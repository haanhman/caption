moved on to do a PhD at the University\nof Canberra in the area of fingermark detection."},"60":{"dur":4,"text":"But that was done in very strong collaboration\nwith UTS."},"64":{"dur":5,"text":"So we've known Xanthe for many years now."},"70":{"dur":2,"text":"She's got a real passion for fingerprints."},"73":{"dur":2,"text":"So I am sure she will share this passion with\nyou."},"75":{"dur":2,"text":"You will see really what I mean."},"78":{"dur":10,"text":"I mean first another thing Xanthe has published\nmany, many peer reviewed papers."},"88":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't have the number because we can't really\nkeep track of all these papers."},"92":{"dur":4,"text":"She's been presenting at a lot of different\ninternational conferences."},"97":{"dur":4,"text":"Actually next week she'll be at the European\nAcademy of Forensic Science conference in"},"102":{"dur":8,"text":"the Netherlands presenting a few papers including\na keynote about fingermark detection."},"111":{"dur":4,"text":"Personally it's been a great pleasure to work\nwith Xanthe over the last five years."},"115":{"dur":1,"text":"I've learned a lot of things."},"117":{"dur":9,"text":"First that my organic chemistry is pretty\ncrap and two I could learn what the term coastie,"},"126":{"dur":1,"text":"actually means."},"127":{"dur":3,"text":"So please welcome Dr Xanthe Spindler."},"131":{"dur":12,"text":"Xanthe Spindler: Thank you, Claude, so welcome\ntonight everyone and my talk tonight is titled"},"144":{"dur":2,"text":"The Fingerprint Detection Revolution."},"146":{"dur":3,"text":"I hope to take you through a little bit of\na history of fingerprints."},"150":{"dur":4,"text":"How the fingerprinting community actually\nevolved and then take you some through some"},"154":{"dur":4,"text":"of the research and the really exciting stuff\nthat we're doing here at UTS at the moment."},"159":{"dur":6,"text":"So the first question I get asked whenever\nI tell anyone what I do is, wow, is it really"},"165":{"dur":3,"text":"like CSI and it's always in that kind of tone\nof voice."},"169":{"dur":5,"text":"To answer that question well I like to think\nthat all forensic scientists are kind of sexy,"},"174":{"dur":2,"text":"really stylish people."},"177":{"dur":3,"text":"Unfortunately we don't go to crime scenes\nwearing Armani and we don't carry guns around"},"181":{"dur":1,"text":"the place."},"182":{"dur":4,"text":"But a lot of the science that you see on TV\nis based in reality."},"187":{"dur":4,"text":"Particularly a lot of the fingerprint techniques\nthat they use on these shows do have some"},"192":{"dur":1,"text":"basis."},"193":{"dur":3,"text":"They may not always get the science right\nand they may jazz it up a bit to look really"},"196":{"dur":6,"text":"good, give it some production values, but\nthere is a strong basis there in reality."},"202":{"dur":3,"text":"The other question I get asked is why fingerprints?"},"206":{"dur":3,"text":"Hasn't DNA taken over as the gold standard\nof identification?"},"210":{"dur":5,"text":"Well that's why we're here tonight and this\nis why I still have a job is that DNA hasn't"},"216":{"dur":2,"text":"taken over fingerprints and why?"},"218":{"dur":3,"text":"Well first off fingerprints have a very rapid\nthroughput."},"222":{"dur":4,"text":"We can process fingerprints quite quickly."},"226":{"dur":4,"text":"The development techniques can take anywhere\nbetween, if you're looking at a powder, say"},"230":{"dur":1,"text":"30 seconds."},"231":{"dur":4,"text":"All you do is get your brush put the powder\non and take a photograph."},"236":{"dur":4,"text":"If you're looking at something like superglue\nfuming it can take up to a couple of hours"},"240":{"dur":3,"text":"but even then the identification process is\nstill pretty quick."},"244":{"dur":6,"text":"DNA profiling you actually have to find the\nstain, cut it out and then do all of your"},"250":{"dur":4,"text":"extraction, your concentration and then do\nyou actual profiling as well."},"255":{"dur":4,"text":"So we can get information very rapidly using\nfingerprints."},"259":{"dur":7,"text":"We can also maximise our chances of identification\nso if we have both DNA and fingerprint evidence"},"266":{"dur":6,"text":"we're twice as likely to try and get an identification\nthan if we just have one or the other."},"272":{"dur":3,"text":"We also have the potential for intelligence\ngathering and I'll talk a bit more about this"},"276":{"dur":1,"text":"later on."},"277":{"dur":4,"text":"But basically some of the new fingerprinting\ntechniques you can actually tell whether a"},"282":{"dur":1,"text":"person is a smoker."},"283":{"dur":4,"text":"You can tell whether they have been handling\nexplosives or certain types of illicit drugs"},"287":{"dur":5,"text":"or whether they've taken certain types of\nillicit drugs as well."},"293":{"dur":3,"text":"Last but not least both of the techniques\nare complementary."},"296":{"dur":6,"text":"So in not all instances someone might not\nleave a DNA profile but they might leave a"},"302":{"dur":4,"text":"fingerprint and vice versa."},"306":{"dur":6,"text":"So why fingerprints why are they such a good\ntechnique for identifying people?"},"313":{"dur":4,"text":"Well when you're looking - we're told from\nan early age that our fingerprints are all"},"317":{"dur":2,"text":"unique and that is true."},"319":{"dur":3,"text":"Every single person has different fingerprint\npatterns."},"323":{"dur":5,"text":"Now this is only part of what makes them such\nan amazing tool for fingerprint identification."},"329":{"dur":4,"text":"It wouldn't be very useful if we had something\nthat was extremely unique, we were the only"},"334":{"dur":4,"text":"person in the world who had that particular\npattern but it could be easily changed or"},"338":{"dur":3,"text":"manipulated in some way to hide our identity."},"342":{"dur":4,"text":"Now fingerprints we can actually tick that\nbox and like DNA as well."},"346":{"dur":4,"text":"We can't change our DNA profile the same as\nwe can't change our fingerprints."},"351":{"dur":5,"text":"Well we can at least try there's usually a\nlot of pain or a really horrific accident"},"356":{"dur":1,"text":"involved."},"357":{"dur":5,"text":"Even then those scars that are formed in that\nprocess then become a tool for identification"},"362":{"dur":1,"text":"in themselves."},"363":{"dur":3,"text":"They are still a unique identifying mark."},"367":{"dur":3,"text":"They're unchanging across the course of our\nlifetime."},"370":{"dur":5,"text":"The fingerprints you are born with they form\nin the second trimester of gestation."},"376":{"dur":7,"text":"So by the time you're about 13 to 24 weeks\nthrough pregnancy, the foetus has fingerprints"},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"already or it's starting to form them."},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"Those fingerprints that we're born with we\neventually die with."},"389":{"dur":5,"text":"They might wear down a bit especially if you've\ndone a lot of hard labour or you're a tradie."},"394":{"dur":4,"text":"Your fingerprint ridges tend to wear down\nover time, but they're still there and they're"},"399":{"dur":3,"text":"still the same pattern."},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"They're also very easy to classify."},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"There are four main types of fingerprint pattern,\nwhich we've got up here."},"408":{"dur":4,"text":"We've got arches which are one of the simplest\npatterns but they're also the rarest."},"412":{"dur":3,"text":"They are only around in about five per cent\nof the population."},"415":{"dur":6,"text":"So if you have arch fingerprints, well done,\nyou are quite a rare specimen, don't go committing"},"422":{"dur":3,"text":"any crimes you'll be easy to catch."},"425":{"dur":7,"text":"We also have whorls, we've got loops and as\nthey sound the names are all classified based"},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"on how they look."},"434":{"dur":5,"text":"So a whorl actually folds, spirals in on itself\nlike a snail shell."},"439":{"dur":4,"text":"A loop loops around on itself in the core\nsection."},"443":{"dur":4,"text":"So the core is just the centre of the fingerprint\nwhere all those ridges come in together."},"447":{"dur":4,"text":"Then we've got our fourth classification which\nis our accidentals."},"452":{"dur":10,"text":"That's basically the catch-all term for anything\nthat doesn't fit in the other three categories."},"462":{"dur":4,"text":"They're imprinted on everything we touch so\nhow do we leave fingerprints behind when we"},"466":{"dur":1,"text":"touch something."},"468":{"dur":5,"text":"We don't leave an entire layer of skin behind\nwhen we pick up a drinking glass."},"474":{"dur":5,"text":"So all of you would have left fingerprints\nbehind on your wine glasses or your juice"},"479":{"dur":4,"text":"glasses when we were having pre-drinks before\nthe lecture."},"483":{"dur":4,"text":"We don't leave an entire layer of fingerprints\nbehind."},"487":{"dur":3,"text":"What we leave behind are sweat and sebum."},"491":{"dur":5,"text":"So sweat is that really perspiration that\nreally sort of wet sweat that I've got a little"},"497":{"dur":4,"text":"bit of now, I'm a little bit clammy, a little\nbit nervous."},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"You can also have sebum which is that really\ngreasy sweat."},"505":{"dur":4,"text":"So for people who have oily skin, that's the\nsebum."},"509":{"dur":5,"text":"Now that rubs off on the surface of our hands\nand whenever we touch something we transfer"},"515":{"dur":6,"text":"that in the shape of our fingerprint ridges\njust like a stamp."},"521":{"dur":8,"text":"This is what we exploit in the case of when\nwe develop latent fingerprints."},"530":{"dur":7,"text":"Now it wasn't always the case that we used\nfingerprint development."},"537":{"dur":5,"text":"Basically a lot of early cultures such as\nthe Chinese and Mesopotamians used fingerprints"},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"as a way of identifying each other."},"545":{"dur":4,"text":"They tended to stamp their pottery with their\nfingerprints in order to identify who made"},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"a particular item."},"552":{"dur":5,"text":"Now as with a lot of knowledge from the Ancient\nWorld this was lost in the Dark Ages."},"558":{"dur":6,"text":"French authorities used to brand their prisoners\nin order to identify them in the Middle Ages."},"565":{"dur":5,"text":"Now you can imagine that fell out of favour\nquite quickly and as policing and forensic"},"570":{"dur":5,"text":"investigation started to evolve in the Victorian\nera we started to look at other methods of"},"576":{"dur":3,"text":"identifying prisoners within the prison system\nitself."},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"Now these weren't methods to identify offenders."},"583":{"dur":5,"text":"They couldn't go out to a crime scene as such\nand identify someone in particular."},"588":{"dur":4,"text":"But they could use it to say oh this person\nhas been incarcerated before this is their"},"593":{"dur":5,"text":"second offence or this is their fifth offence,\nwe've got a record of them already."},"598":{"dur":10,"text":"So in 1880, 1881 Alphonse Bertillon determined\nthis method called anthropometry."},"609":{"dur":6,"text":"Basically shown here they used to use measurements\nand photographs of a person's basic body measurements."},"616":{"dur":5,"text":"So the length of their arm to the tip of their\nfinger, pretty much any sort of standard height"},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"measurement, also measurements around the\nface."},"624":{"dur":4,"text":"You can kind of think of this a very crude\nprecursor to a lot of the biometric systems"},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"like facial recognition that we use today."},"632":{"dur":7,"text":"Now this was standardised in 1881 by Bertillon\nand a lot of places used to use this or a"},"640":{"dur":6,"text":"lot of jurisdictions used to use this to identify\ntheir prisoners."},"646":{"dur":6,"text":"Now basically around this time a few other\npeople decided that fingerprinting may not"},"652":{"dur":7,"text":"actually be the best method, sorry the anthropometry\nsystem may not be the best method of identifying"},"660":{"dur":1,"text":"people."},"661":{"dur":6,"text":"So we had five researchers here across the\nglobe situated in Japan, India and in England"},"668":{"dur":5,"text":"and Argentina, looking at whether you could\nuse those fingerprint ridges, those fingerprint"},"673":{"dur":3,"text":"patterns in order to identify prisoners."},"677":{"dur":5,"text":"It was Dr Henry Faulds and Sir William Herschel\nthat really did a lot of the legwork at the"},"682":{"dur":8,"text":"start to really identify whether fingerprints\nare unique and whether they stay the same"},"691":{"dur":1,"text":"across the population."},"692":{"dur":3,"text":"You can imagine the amount of data they had\nto collect to do that."},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"It was a monumental task."},"699":{"dur":7,"text":"Now it was around this time that Sir Henry\nGalton got involved with the help of Charles"},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"Darwin."},"707":{"dur":5,"text":"Basically they started to look at identifying,\nwriting this book here, Finger Prints, which"},"713":{"dur":3,"text":"is a text book that we still revere today."},"716":{"dur":5,"text":"This is a photo of us revering said text book\nat a conference last year, the International"},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"Fingerprint Research Group Conference in Sweden."},"725":{"dur":4,"text":"Lisa, could you just go check what that was\nabout?"},"729":{"dur":10,"text":"Now around this time an Argentinean researcher\nJuan Vucetich started to look at whether they"},"740":{"dur":5,"text":"could use fingerprints to identify the prisoners\nalready in the Argentinean system."},"746":{"dur":5,"text":"Around the same time Galton was tirelessly\ntrying to get the English authorities and"},"752":{"dur":4,"text":"Scotland Yard to sort of come on board and\nto talk about fingerprints."},"756":{"dur":5,"text":"He managed to get them to at least think of\nit as a complementary technique to anthropometry."},"762":{"dur":4,"text":"So you've now got all of your body measurements\nyour photographs plus the fingerprints of"},"767":{"dur":3,"text":"the prisoners in the system."},"770":{"dur":7,"text":"Now in 1984 there was a rather brutal murder\nin a small county in Argentina."},"777":{"dur":4,"text":"A man had attacked a mother and her two small\nchildren."},"782":{"dur":1,"text":"The two children died."},"783":{"dur":4,"text":"Now he left many, many blood soaked fingerprints\nat the crime scene."},"788":{"dur":6,"text":"Back in these days fingerprint powders which\nwe kind of think as the fall back for fingerprint"},"795":{"dur":4,"text":"dusting and fingerprint enhancement weren't\nactually all that common."},"799":{"dur":4,"text":"They were around but they weren't really known\nabout and weren't used."},"804":{"dur":5,"text":"So they were really reliant on having some\nsort of colour contamination on the skin in"},"810":{"dur":3,"text":"order to photograph those fingerprints and\nto see them."},"814":{"dur":5,"text":"Now the suspect had denied and denied and\ndenied that he was involved."},"819":{"dur":4,"text":"They finally took his fingerprints and when\nthey compared them to the marks in blood that"},"823":{"dur":3,"text":"they found at the crime scene they eventually\nconvicted him."},"827":{"dur":6,"text":"It was at that point that fingerprints were\nstarting to be used in Argentina as form of"},"833":{"dur":1,"text":"forensic evidence in their own right."},"834":{"dur":5,"text":"They had now moved as a way of identifying\nprisoners to identifying offenders at crime"},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"scenes."},"843":{"dur":5,"text":"Meanwhile back in England, Galton was still\nfighting pretty hard to get fingerprints used"},"848":{"dur":1,"text":"as a piece of forensic evidence."},"850":{"dur":8,"text":"The 1900s dealt two major blows to the anthropometry\nsystem and these were the two death blows."},"859":{"dur":3,"text":"The first was a robbery of a set of billiard\nballs."},"862":{"dur":4,"text":"Yes billiard balls on Denmark Hill in England."},"866":{"dur":7,"text":"The crime scene investigators found many dirty\nmarks, fingerprint impressions on a window"},"874":{"dur":6,"text":"sill that the thief had used to enter and\nexit from the building."},"880":{"dur":4,"text":"They identified these to be from an offender\nknown as Harry Jackson who was known to police"},"885":{"dur":4,"text":"for other offences and he now has the dubious\nhonour of being the first ever person in the"},"890":{"dur":6,"text":"Commonwealth to be convicted on the basis\nof fingerprint evidence."},"896":{"dur":8,"text":"The other death blow was an unfortunate incidence\nat Fort Leavenworth prison in the US."},"904":{"dur":6,"text":"A young man by the name of Will West was taken\nto Fort Leavenworth and convicted, or was"},"911":{"dur":2,"text":"charged with several crimes."},"914":{"dur":5,"text":"Now he had again denied that he was involved\nin anything else."},"919":{"dur":7,"text":"When they took his measurements took his photographs\nthey found that he was - that he'd already"},"927":{"dur":5,"text":"been in the system and started to question\nhim about prior offences."},"932":{"dur":3,"text":"Now again he denied he'd been involved in\nanything, this was his first arrest."},"935":{"dur":4,"text":"How could have he done any of these other\ncrimes that he was purported to do."},"940":{"dur":4,"text":"The prison officers didn't believe him, they\nthought it was just a case of another convict"},"944":{"dur":5,"text":"being coy about previous offences to try and\nget a lighter sentence."},"949":{"dur":5,"text":"He also matched the name of William West who\nwas already in the system."},"954":{"dur":6,"text":"The problem here William West was still incarcerated\nin the exact same prison."},"960":{"dur":4,"text":"At this point countries started to abandon\nthe Bertillon system."},"965":{"dur":5,"text":"We were the first to set up a fingerprint\nbureau I 1903 and New South Wales had already"},"970":{"dur":8,"text":"taken the measures the year before to start\nintroducing fingerprinting in the prison system."},"979":{"dur":7,"text":"Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania\n- oops, what have I done there?"},"986":{"dur":7,"text":"Hello, ah there we go, technology it's a wonderful\nthing."},"994":{"dur":11,"text":"So New South Wales and Victoria, Queensland\nand South Australia, Tasmania, Western Australia,"},"1005":{"dur":8,"text":"the Northern Territory and then the ACT, on\nthe bandwagon right at the end followed suit"},"1014":{"dur":3,"text":"and set up their own individual fingerprint\nbureaus."},"1017":{"dur":4,"text":"The ACT to be fair to them were probably under\nthe umbrella of New South Wales Police for"},"1022":{"dur":2,"text":"quite a long time."},"1025":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay, so who stole my wine bottle?"},"1029":{"dur":5,"text":"Did anyone actually see the thief?"},"1034":{"dur":4,"text":"Yes, no?"},"1039":{"dur":5,"text":"Well Lisa has kindly chased down two potential\nsuspects here."},"1045":{"dur":5,"text":"So girls, they're both students."},"1050":{"dur":4,"text":"I understand I've been an undergrad before\nI know what it's like to be desperate for"},"1054":{"dur":2,"text":"a bottle of red."},"1057":{"dur":3,"text":"So who here thinks it was Claire here?"},"1061":{"dur":5,"text":"Unidentified Speaker: Yes of course it was\nClaire."},"1066":{"dur":3,"text":"Xanthe Spindler: Who thinks it was Leanna?"},"1069":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's very hard to see from up here."},"1073":{"dur":3,"text":"But okay so we've got a few people."},"1076":{"dur":3,"text":"Who doesn't have a clue at all?"},"1079":{"dur":3,"text":"The majority of the audience, nicely done."},"1082":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay so we can't separate these girls based\non their measurements."},"1087":{"dur":3,"text":"They're both very similar height, they're\nvery similar builds."},"1090":{"dur":1,"text":"They're both wearing the same clothes."},"1091":{"dur":7,"text":"If we were to basically use just the Bertillon\nsystem we wouldn't be able to identify who"},"1098":{"dur":1,"text":"stole that wine bottle."},"1100":{"dur":5,"text":"Also using eye witness accounts, again we\ncan't identify who is who because it happened"},"1106":{"dur":1,"text":"so quickly, it was dark."},"1108":{"dur":5,"text":"You can't really tell them apart."},"1113":{"dur":7,"text":"Now there are two ways we can identify a person,\nthe first is DNA profiling."},"1120":{"dur":4,"text":"Unfortunately you can see here I don't have\nany DNA profiling equipment with me."},"1125":{"dur":5,"text":"So I'll have to go with a much better method\nfingerprinting, sorry, biologists, sorry,"},"1130":{"dur":1,"text":"Tamara, I'm biased."},"1132":{"dur":2,"text":"Can you please thank our lovely suspects here?"},"1135":{"dur":1,"text":"[Applause]"},"1136":{"dur":4,"text":"Xanthe Spindler: Thank you, girls."},"1140":{"dur":14,"text":"Okay so safe work practices and to protect\nthe evidence I shall glove up."},"1155":{"dur":5,"text":"Now powders have been around since 1891 so\nthey've been around for quite a long time"},"1161":{"dur":5,"text":"and in fact before fingerprints were used\nas a forensic tool."},"1166":{"dur":3,"text":"They were very much concoctions of your own\ndevising."},"1170":{"dur":1,"text":"There were no standard recipes."},"1172":{"dur":4,"text":"You couldn't go to a forensic supplier like\nwe do these days and buy a specific powder"},"1176":{"dur":2,"text":"that you like."},"1179":{"dur":3,"text":"Most of them consisted of pretty much anything\nthat would adhere to fingerprint ridges."},"1183":{"dur":4,"text":"That was the only criterion for making a good\nfingerprint powder."},"1187":{"dur":5,"text":"Soot, which is the base of a lot of early\nfingerprint powders is still used today and"},"1192":{"dur":6,"text":"the black powders that are commercialised\nare still made primarily of soot."},"1198":{"dur":4,"text":"So what I have here is a fingerprint powder\nknown as Blitz-Green, as the name suggests"},"1203":{"dur":5,"text":"it's a lovely green colour."},"1209":{"dur":5,"text":"This is a magnetic powder so we've also got\nmagnetic iron particles in here which makes"},"1214":{"dur":1,"text":"it much easier to apply."},"1215":{"dur":4,"text":"Most of the powders that you may be used to\nseeing are applied with just a standard brush."},"1220":{"dur":5,"text":"They are good but you can damage the print\nif you are a little bit heavy-handed."},"1226":{"dur":4,"text":"In our labs we tend to find girls are quite\ngood at applying the fingerprint powders as"},"1231":{"dur":5,"text":"a general rule because they're used to applying\nfoundation and using a feather touch."},"1236":{"dur":4,"text":"The boys on the other hand, it's really a\n50\/50 bet as to whether they're going to wipe"},"1240":{"dur":3,"text":"their evidence off the surface the first time\nthey do it or whether they are going to get"},"1244":{"dur":2,"text":"a usable print."},"1246":{"dur":6,"text":"So I've got the bottle here, I'm just going\nto take some of my powder trying not to spill"},"1253":{"dur":11,"text":"it everywhere and just brush that over the\nsurface and try and find some fingerprints."},"1264":{"dur":13,"text":"Ah, I've got lots and lots of fingerprints\nhere."},"1277":{"dur":22,"text":"Okay ooh, this is actually live, folks, you\ncan tell because it's a not so delicate process."},"1299":{"dur":10,"text":"Okay so I've got a few fingerprints here that\nmight be quite useful."},"1309":{"dur":5,"text":"But it's quite hard to see because of the\ncolour of the bottle itself is green."},"1315":{"dur":4,"text":"We've got a green powder and obviously from\na distance it's quite difficult for you guys"},"1320":{"dur":1,"text":"to see."},"1322":{"dur":4,"text":"Now if we want to improve contrasts there\nare a couple of different methods we can use"},"1326":{"dur":2,"text":"to really bring up those ridges."},"1329":{"dur":4,"text":"The first is to just use different angles\nof light and different coloured filters to"},"1334":{"dur":5,"text":"try and block out the background so we get\nreally dark ridges on a bright background"},"1340":{"dur":3,"text":"or really bright ridges on a dark background."},"1343":{"dur":4,"text":"The other thing we can use is something called\nluminescence."},"1347":{"dur":3,"text":"Now who here has seen one of these before?"},"1351":{"dur":3,"text":"Yes, it's a typical glow stick."},"1355":{"dur":6,"text":"Now you can see here it's got some colour\njust as a visible colour itself."},"1361":{"dur":8,"text":"If we want to make that easier to see we snap\nit, mix the two chemicals in here together,"},"1370":{"dur":1,"text":"give it a shake."},"1371":{"dur":3,"text":"A handy hint for those of you still doing\nHigh School chemistry, shaking things makes"},"1375":{"dur":2,"text":"reactions go faster."},"1377":{"dur":7,"text":"So now you can see that's much brighter than\nwhat it was before I'd mixed those two together."},"1385":{"dur":4,"text":"Now this is a specific form of luminescence\ncalled chemi luminescence."},"1390":{"dur":6,"text":"So there's two chemicals mixing to form a\nreaction, which then gives off light as a"},"1396":{"dur":1,"text":"by-product."},"1397":{"dur":5,"text":"The method we're using today is just - it's\na slightly different form of luminescence."},"1403":{"dur":7,"text":"So what you do is you shine a light source\nonto the powder and what the powder does is"},"1410":{"dur":5,"text":"it absorbs that light and then emits light\na longer wavelength."},"1416":{"dur":7,"text":"So if I'm shining green on there it should\nemit around the yellow region of the spectrum."},"1424":{"dur":7,"text":"Again you need the right tools in
