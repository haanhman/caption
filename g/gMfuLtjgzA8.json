their heads\naround the math."},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"And what I found out by\ndoing further research"},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"is NASA does this by\ncomputer simulation."},"854":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's what I did."},"858":{"dur":3,"text":"I wrote this program\ncalled Orbits."},"861":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't how well\nthat's showing up."},"862":{"dur":0,"text":"Let me take a

you"},"1003":{"dur":1,"text":"can take a slightly\ndifferent course"},"1005":{"dur":1,"text":"and get back to Earth earlier."},"1007":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's, of course,\nwhat anybody would
