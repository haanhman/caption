I suppose the big question is,"},"20":{"dur":4,"text":"what happens next?\nAnother one. He announced that he was intending"},"24":{"dur":5,"text":"to do one more rate cut before the end of\nthe year if economics pan out as he expects,"},"30":{"dur":4,"text":"but he did say he was going to stop there.\nHe doesn't believe in negative rates. That"},"34":{"dur":4,"text":"doesn't mean the end of accommodation. It\nprobably means more QE programmes rather than"},"39":{"dur":2,"text":"further rate cuts.\nSo when you say another rate cut, what are"},"42":{"dur":7,"text":"we talking? Are we talking 0.1%?\nHe will take it just above zero. He won't"},"49":{"dur":3,"text":"go exactly to zero. There's technical reasons\nfor that. But we should view it as taking"},"53":{"dur":4,"text":"rates to zero.\nAnd he said that he saw under no circumstance"},"57":{"dur":5,"text":"would there be a reason to go to negative\nrates. What makes the U.K. situation different"},"62":{"dur":4,"text":"then from what we see in Japan and in Europe\nwhere they have seen a reason to go negative?"},"67":{"dur":3,"text":"I think that's the exact reason that he is\nlooking at that situation and he says it's"},"70":{"dur":4,"text":"damaged the financial system which is going\nto damage the economy. Therefore, I don't"},"74":{"dur":3,"text":"want to follow suit.\nAnd of course, negative rates are one lever."},"78":{"dur":4,"text":"Rates indeed are one lever, but it wasn't\nthe only thing he did yesterday. He also announced"},"82":{"dur":4,"text":"a QE bond buying programme, $60 billion for\ngilts, $10 billion for corporate bonds. What"},"87":{"dur":3,"text":"happens after this load of QE? Do we get more\nof the same?"},"90":{"dur":3,"text":"If things don't improve, we get more of the\nsame that we've moved into the same situation"},"94":{"dur":4,"text":"as all the other central banks around world.\nI don't think we should view it as a knee-jerk"},"98":{"dur":4,"text":"reaction. This was clearly thought out and\nplanned before Brexit. In my opinion, it's"},"103":{"dur":4,"text":"probably an overreaction. It's a lot very\nquickly with not many data points to say we"},"107":{"dur":4,"text":"need that much at this point.\nIn Europe, of course, they have focused more"},"111":{"dur":3,"text":"on corporate bond buying. Do you think that's\nsomething that we'll see here in the U.K."},"115":{"dur":4,"text":"or is this $10 billion going to remain a small\nportion of a larger QE programme?"},"119":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, it's difficult one to answer. On the\none hand, it is a lot smaller than the European"},"124":{"dur":5,"text":"one, but then the U.K. corporate market is\na lot smaller. So there will be liquidity"},"130":{"dur":4,"text":"issues.

I think he\nsaid in the press conference yesterday that"},"152":{"dur":7,"text":"only 150 issues were actually good enough\nquality in order to qualify for this corporate"},"159":{"dur":5,"text":"bond buying programme. What does it really\nmean for bondholders then, for bond investors?"},"165":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, it's a fantastic news for bond investors,\nespecially corporate bond investors.

So, there's a huge safety net for\ncorporate bond investors. So, for the investors,"},"187":{"dur":2,"text":"it's great news.\nAnd of course, there was one other lever that"},"190":{"dur":4,"text":"he used, this funding for lending or term\nlending. What exactly is that and how does"},"194":{"dur":3,"text":"that benefit the economy?\nYeah. That shouldn't be viewed as separate"},"197":{"dur":4,"text":"from or additional stimulus to the rest of\nthe package. What he said was he wants to"},"202":{"dur":5,"text":"ensure that the rate cut finds its way through\nto you and I in the economy.
