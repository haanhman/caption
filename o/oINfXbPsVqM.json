works for\nthem is every day."},"640":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah."},"641":{"dur":3,"text":"Very\u2026 there are certain stretches of my\nlife, times in my life, where that\u2019s

months\nin a row I didn't write a word."},"652":{"dur":4,"text":"And what I\u2019ve found is when, like, I make\nan appointment with myself and I don't look"},"657":{"dur":1,"text":"at each day."},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"I look at the calendar ahead."},"659":{"dur":5,"text":"And it\u2019s been really helpful for me actually\nalso to decide when not to write,

tell myself you\u2019re not going to write\nnow and then you\u2019re going to write then."},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"And then what I do is I make good on

her and I was like, \u201cYou\nare absolutely a writer."},"771":{"dur":3,"text":"Because if you write once a month, guess what\nhappens by the end of that year?"},"774":{"dur":1,"text":"You\u2019ve
