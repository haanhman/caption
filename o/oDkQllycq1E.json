were two things I remember about\nmy dad and one was eavesdropping on all of"},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"these conversations that he had with other\npeople in ministry because our life was full"},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"of people in ministry."},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"All my grandfather's friends, all my father's\nfriends were in ministry."},"377":{"dur":4,"text":"A lot of them were pastors and evangelists."},"382":{"dur":3,"text":"Just listening to their conversation was in\nitself kind of theological education."},"386":{"dur":6,"text":"I knew it was in their heart because the mouth\nspeaks the preoccupations of the heart."},"392":{"dur":5,"text":"I was greatly blessed in being able to be\naround and eavesdrop on those kinds of conversations."},"398":{"dur":1,"text":"Life was much slower then."},"399":{"dur":2,"text":"The whole pace was slow."},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"Conversations could last a long time, and\nI benefited from that."},"404":{"dur":6,"text":"The other thing that really had a profound\ninfluence on me was my father's reading."},"411":{"dur":3,"text":"I never saw him without a book in his hand\nor some kind of magazine."},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"He was just an insatiable reader."},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"He never could get enough."},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"Always by his chair, piles of books."},"421":{"dur":5,"text":"He had a hunger to know and to learn, which\nmade him a really amazing conversationalist"},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"because well-read people make the best conversationalists."},"429":{"dur":3,"text":"We all know what it's like to go to a family\nevent and hear your old uncle tell the same"},"433":{"dur":4,"text":"story he told last year and the year before\nand the year before, because he doesn't know"},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"anything beyond what he knew in the past."},"440":{"dur":4,"text":"I never had two conversations alike with my\ndad because he just read and read and read"},"444":{"dur":1,"text":"widely."},"445":{"dur":8,"text":"So, I think listening to conversations and\nwatching my dad read and know that he lived"},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"in the real world, the world of his own ministry."},"456":{"dur":5,"text":"But he lived in the world of books and theology\nand biographies and things that fascinated"},"461":{"dur":1,"text":"him."},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"He read in all kinds of fields, so that was\na great gift to give to me."},"466":{"dur":1,"text":"I wasn't naturally a student."},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"I was more naturally an athlete."},"470":{"dur":7,"text":"That was kind of where I would naturally gravitate,\nso there were some disciplines in becoming"},"477":{"dur":1,"text":"a reader."},"478":{"dur":6,"text":"But I think a lot of that came from the level\nof conversations that I listened to with people"},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"who were reading and who were growing in their\nunderstanding."},"488":{"dur":1,"text":"That set a pattern for me."},"489":{"dur":7,"text":"AUSTIN: That's helpful to hear because those\nare definitely influences that I think many"},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"of us would say about you, and we see that\nin you."},"500":{"dur":3,"text":"You're a reader with a great appetite."},"503":{"dur":5,"text":"You are constantly engaged in conversations\nabout ministry."},"509":{"dur":5,"text":"I think it's a great testimony to see that\nmark passed on generationally in your

curiosity beyond just theology."},"544":{"dur":5,"text":"I'm curious about lots of things in the world\nthat the Lord has created and the behaviors"},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"of fallen men and all of that."},"552":{"dur":4,"text":"But I think it's stimulated by the fact that\nI'm in the same place, and everything I've"},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"ever said is recorded."},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"I need to keep growing and keep reading."},"562":{"dur":6,"text":"I remember my dad said to me one time when\nhe was in his late 80s, he said, \"Johnny,"},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm still reading, but I really don't know\nwhy.\""},"570":{"dur":1,"text":"AUSTIN: Hmm."},"571":{"dur":11,"text":"JOHN: I knew that was signifying that he was\nturning a corner after so many, many years"},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"of reading."},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"\"I'm still reading, but I don't know why.\""},"586":{"dur":5,"text":"It wasn't long after that until he didn't\nhave any place to

like to spread that around because,\nrelax folks, I'm not going to be here until"},"600":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm 90."},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"[Laughter] So have no fear."},"602":{"dur":1,"text":"AUSTIN: We'll get to that question later."},"604":{"dur":1,"text":"JOHN: Okay."},"605":{"dur":3,"text":"AUSTIN: We've actually crafted a plan for\nyou to stay until you're 120."},"608":{"dur":6,"text":"[Laughter] I agree with that."},"614":{"dur":5,"text":"[Applause] So there's actually some questions\nthat relate to some of what you've said here."},"619":{"dur":4,"text":"One of the questions we ask you a lot on staff\nis, \"What are you reading lately?\""},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"Some people turned that question in."},"625":{"dur":3,"text":"Any books that you've been reading lately\nyou'd like to talk about?"},"628":{"dur":4,"text":"Something impactful or interesting in your\nwalk with the Lord, or just maybe something"},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"that's grabbed your attention lately?"},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"JOHN: Well, there's a new biography by Thomas\nKidd on George Whitefield."},"638":{"dur":4,"text":"You gave it to me, and you've given me a lot\nof interesting things to read."},"643":{"dur":5,"text":"But knowing enough about George Whitefield\nto sort of be dangerous, to sort of not really"},"649":{"dur":4,"text":"know the full story, I couldn't get fast enough\ninto that book."},"653":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm about half way through the biography of\nGeorge Whitefield who basically was the spiritual"},"657":{"dur":1,"text":"architect of America."},"658":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean he was the founding father on the spiritual\nlevel in America, more so than Jonathan Edwards."},"662":{"dur":7,"text":"Jonathan Edwards had theological brains, but\nWhitefield was the oratorical genius."},"669":{"dur":5,"text":"It's just been fascinating to see this man\nand how God used him."},"675":{"dur":4,"text":"He grew up with theater in his life."},"679":{"dur":4,"text":"He thought he wanted to be an actor, and then\nhe turned to have disdain for the theater"},"683":{"dur":3,"text":"because it was bawdy and it was unacceptable."},"686":{"dur":1,"text":"So he preached against the theater."},"688":{"dur":4,"text":"He preached against going to the theater,\nbut he maintained all of his acting skills"},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"as a preacher."},"695":{"dur":6,"text":"He just was compelling and riveting, and he\nwould go into a field and preach 20,000 people."},"702":{"dur":4,"text":"Benjamin Franklin did tests to see if he could\nbe heard from - he made friendship with Benjamin"},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"Franklin, who was a non-Christian deist."},"708":{"dur":3,"text":"But Franklin was so fascinated by him because\nhe made a lot of money for Franklin because"},"712":{"dur":1,"text":"Franklin had a publishing company."},"714":{"dur":4,"text":"He published George Whitefield, but he never\nbelieved in the gospel."},"718":{"dur":7,"text":"But studying Whitefield's just tireless, tireless\npreaching day after

Yeah."},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"JOHN: Really an amazing, amazing life."},"735":{"dur":3,"text":"So I like Christian biography."},"739":{"dur":4,"text":"I just recently wrote a chapter for a new\nbook that's coming out."},"743":{"dur":7,"text":"They asked me to do a chapter on David Martin\nLloyd Jones, and so I wrote a chapter on David"},"750":{"dur":1,"text":"Martyn

just\nthinking it through - he actually asked Patricia"},"781":{"dur":3,"text":"to do it."},"784":{"dur":5,"text":"So we were just thinking it all through together,\nas she was kind of putting her thoughts together"},"789":{"dur":1,"text":"on that."},"790":{"dur":5,"text":"It struck me that really great biographies\nnot only inform us, but they convict us."},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"You read Whitefield and you feel like a slacker."},"798":{"dur":3,"text":"You feel like, what; you only preached three\ntimes this week, four times this week?"},"802":{"dur":1,"text":"That's a day's work for George Whitefield."},"803":{"dur":3,"text":"Get on a horse and go somewhere and do it\nagain every day."},"806":{"dur":4,"text":"I think there's some power in that kind of\nconviction, that kind of exposure."},"811":{"dur":4,"text":"It isn't just the novelty of their life."},"815":{"dur":7,"text":"It's that you need to be convicted about your\nown - I guess your own lack of commitment."},"823":{"dur":3,"text":"You need to be humbled."},"827":{"dur":5,"text":"Just when you think you've done what you should\ndo, you run across somebody like that or

primitive time in a very difficult life"},"844":{"dur":1,"text":"."},"845":{"dur":1,"text":"So I like to read biographies."},"847":{"dur":8,"text":"I've read Amy's and Whitefield and Tyndale,\nsome

sociology."},"872":{"dur":6,"text":"I don't know where he is spiritually, but\nfrom my viewpoint, it shows how God providentially"},"878":{"dur":2,"text":"orders people's lives."},"881":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I've read history books."},"884":{"dur":5,"text":"I'm in the middle of reading two or three\nhistory books because I get fascinated by"},"889":{"dur":1,"text":"that."},"890":{"dur":4,"text":"AUSTIN: The reason I like to hear you talk\nabout books is because they go through the"},"894":{"dur":3,"text":"MacArthur grid, which is a

like that's not how we do it here."},"1014":{"dur":4,"text":"So maybe you could talk a little bit about\nJesus's baptism and how it relates to ours"},"1018":{"dur":1,"text":"or if it relates to ours."},"1019":{"dur":1,"text":"Then, who should baptize?"},"1021":{"dur":2,"text":"JOHN: Well, of course, among the Jews, nobody\nwas baptized."},"1024":{"dur":3,"text":"There was no such thing as
