them."},"1219":{"dur":2,"text":"There's two principles\nhere at work."},"1222":{"dur":3,"text":"One is resistance, and\nthe other is letting go."},"1226":{"dur":5,"text":"When we give resistance

passing of that."},"1267":{"dur":2,"text":"But if there's that\nresistance, then in a sense"},"1269":{"dur":1,"text":"it holds it in place."},"1271":{"dur":3,"text":"And so shoulding and the\nmany other things that we do"},"1274":{"dur":2,"text":"can create that resistance."},"1277":{"dur":4,"text":"And the sad thing it is that\nat some level what we're doing"},"1281":{"dur":5,"text":"we think is really in our best\ninterest, but in fact it's not."},"1286":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, yeah, we have to\nbe willing to sit with it."},"1291":{"dur":2,"text":"And once we recognize\nit, then she

you in this group."},"1404":{"dur":3,"text":"It had more to do\nwith my history,"},"1407":{"dur":3,"text":"and it hit some real nerves in\nthe areas of shame and stuff"},"1411":{"dur":0,"text":"like that."},"1412":{"dur":3,"text":"And it was really,\nreally uncomfortable."},"1415":{"dur":0,"text":"And I went into it."},"1416":{"dur":0,"text":"I went away from it."},"1417":{"dur":2,"text":"I went

mine."},"1540":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, it may be showing up\nin my relationship to you,"},"1543":{"dur":1,"text":"but that came for me."},"1545":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that compassion\nI extend towards

the very first\nthing I want to do"},"1622":{"dur":3,"text":"before I choose an attitude,\nwhich may be kindness,"},"1625":{"dur":2,"text":"I have to check my\nattitude at the

think you get the idea."},"1765":{"dur":6,"text":"But yet I felt that in our\nrelationship I owed him amends."},"1771":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I went, and\nI apologized

allowing."},"1841":{"dur":3,"text":"Which of the two am I choosing,\nresistance or allowing?"},"1844":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I have to develop\nthat pattern of allowing."},"1847":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's where the mindfulness\nbecomes so important."},"1850":{"dur":2,"text":"If we don't have that awareness,\nthen we don't have that choice."},"1853":{"dur":5,"text":"And our natural instinct\nis

seeing it for\nwhat includes not"},"1933":{"dur":1,"text":"only my cognitive\nexperience of it,"},"1935":{"dur":2,"text":"but my emotional experience."},"1937":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I have to be
