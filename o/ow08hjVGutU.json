panel,"},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"where we might be tempted\nto use a thinner material,"},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"is actually something\nwe're going to drill into"},"255":{"dur":1,"text":"and we're going to put some dowels"},"256":{"dur":1,"text":"and things like that for storage"},"258":{"dur":2,"text":"so we want that extra\nmaterial to work with."},"261":{"dur":1,"text":"Now let's break it down

inch."},"293":{"dur":2,"text":"We also have to have that back panel"},"295":{"dur":3,"text":"inset by about 3\/4 of\nan inch so that there's"},"298":{"dur":2,"text":"a 3\/4 of an inch gap in the back"},"301":{"dur":1,"text":"and the reason for that is we're going to"},"302":{"dur":3,"text":"use a French cleat for\nstorage and you need at least"},"305":{"dur":2,"text":"3\/4 of an inch

left"},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"you may just wind up\ncutting that board in half."},"337":{"dur":2,"text":"The sliding doors will be 1\/4 inch ply."},"340":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, if you have some\nreally nice material"},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"or a different species,\ngo ahead and use that"},"344":{"dur":1,"text":"because it's going to look great."},"346":{"dur":1,"text":"If you just have a Baltic birch case,"},"347":{"dur":1,"text":"throw some walnut doors\non there or something."},"349":{"dur":1,"text":"That's going to look awesome."},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"And now the 2 things that\nwe don't know at this point"},"353":{"dur":2,"text":"are the overall dimensions, length, width,"},"356":{"dur":1,"text":"and depth of this cabinet,"},"357":{"dur":2,"text":"and, of course, the interior arrangement."},"360":{"dur":1,"text":"Now this is going to be very different"},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"depending on what you\nwant to put in yours."},"363":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to store some planes"},"365":{"dur":1,"text":"and a few different hand tools,"},"366":{"dur":1,"text":"we'll get to that, but my arrangement's"},"368":{"dur":1,"text":"gonna be very different than yours."},"370":{"dur":1,"text":"So just keep in mind what tools you have,"},"372":{"dur":1,"text":"what things you want to keep in there,"},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"and just rearrange that\ninterior to suit your needs."},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"So the only thing left to do at this point"},"378":{"dur":1,"text":"is to go out to the shop,"},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"take some measurements\nfrom the actual tools,"},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"and use those as a guide\nto tell us how big,"},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"how deep, how tall, how\nwide, all that good stuff."},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"So let's run out to the\nshop and do just that."},"390":{"dur":1,"text":"Now you can see I got a pretty good"},"391":{"dur":1,"text":"amount of stuff on the wall already,"},"393":{"dur":3,"text":"all of my chisels,

in\nmy tool cabinet is my planes."},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"I've never quite come up\nwith a great storage solution"},"406":{"dur":1,"text":"so that's really what I'm after."},"408":{"dur":3,"text":"So, of course, I've got all\nof my planes on the bench here"},"411":{"dur":1,"text":"and the idea is I want to know what"},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"are the maximum dimensions\nI need to be concerned with."},"415":{"dur":1,"text":"I've got my #7 here and that's going to be"},"417":{"dur":1,"text":"the biggest plane in my collection."},"419":{"dur":1,"text":"So I want to know what the length is."},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"That's going to dictate what each half"},"423":{"dur":2,"text":"of this cabinet is going to be."},"425":{"dur":1,"text":"This would be in one half"},"426":{"dur":1,"text":"and, of course, I want\nit to be symmetrical"},"428":{"dur":1,"text":"so the other side of the cabinet"},"429":{"dur":1,"text":"has to be about the same width."},"432":{"dur":1,"text":"I need to know - see, I'm going to store"},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"them in on the shelf like this"},"435":{"dur":4,"text":"so, of course, the side to\nside width of this plane"},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"is going to be important 'cause that's"},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"going to be the height of the shelf"},"441":{"dur":1,"text":"and if you go from the bed"},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"to the top of the handle area here,"},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"that's going to dictate\nthe depth of the cabinet."},"448":{"dur":1,"text":"So all of these are numbers that"},"449":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to need to write down."},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"All these other planes, I might be able"},"453":{"dur":3,"text":"to fit 2 on the same shelf, you know?"},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"This is about 22 inches\nif I remember correctly."},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"Take a quick measurement."},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah, it's 22 so, of course, I could maybe"},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"put my 2 smoothers on the same shelf."},"467":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay, but really what we're looking for"},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"is the maximum dimensions."},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"We're also looking to figure out"},"472":{"dur":1,"text":"are there some really unusual things"},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"that we're going to\nneed to store in there."},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's go take a look\nat my old tool cabinet"},"477":{"dur":1,"text":"and I'll show you some of the other things"},"478":{"dur":1,"text":"that I'm going to try\nto fit into this one."},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"Now you have to excuse the\ncrappy lighting in this spot."},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm kind of in a dark corner of the shop."},"485":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is the old cabinet."},"487":{"dur":1,"text":"You can see I've got my block planes,"},"488":{"dur":1,"text":"shoulder planes, some spokeshaves."},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"Those are all things I'm going to"},"491":{"dur":1,"text":"want to store in the new one."},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"And another thing I find really handy"},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"to have in the tool\ncabinet is my drill bits."},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"I like to make these little\nthings that you can pull out"},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's really nothing more than a 2 x 4"},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"and some holes drilled into it,"},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"but I like to store those in this cabinet."},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"I really haven't found a better place"},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"or a better way to store these things"},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"so what I'm going to\nneed to be concerned with"},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"are which sets I'm\ngoing to include in here"},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"and how tall they are because you can see"},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"you need a good amount of\nspace to fit some of these,"},"521":{"dur":1,"text":"like these boring bits up here."},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"The Forstners are a little bit shorter."},"525":{"dur":1,"text":"My brad point bits, things like that."},"526":{"dur":1,"text":"You just gotta make sure you know"},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"exactly what you want to put in there,"},"529":{"dur":0,"text":"take some measurements,"},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"give it a little bit of breathing room"},"531":{"dur":1,"text":"'cause you never know, you might buy"},"533":{"dur":1,"text":"a new set in the future."},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"But for the most part, that's really it."},"536":{"dur":3,"text":"The big planes, these\nlittle guys, little scraper,"},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"a couple of these neat little ones"},"542":{"dur":1,"text":"that I've gotten from Lee Valley,"},"544":{"dur":1,"text":"you know, and the bits themselves."},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"Other than that, that's about all"},"547":{"dur":1,"text":"I really need to store in mine"},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"so, of course, the inside of my cabinet"},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"is going to be a reflection\nof the tools that I own."},"554":{"dur":1,"text":"But we can talk as a group and figure out"},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"storage solutions for any unusual stuff"},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"you might want to put\ninto your tool cabinet."},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"Now armed with those measurements"},"561":{"dur":2,"text":"and all the things that we\nalready know about the project,"},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to hop on Sketch Up"},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'm just going to use it to work out"},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"a few different things\nin terms of proportions,"},"570":{"dur":1,"text":"just double check and make sure"},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"everything looks right."},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm not going to render this\nentire thing in Sketch Up."},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"Honestly, it's too time consuming"},"577":{"dur":1,"text":"and when you're just building a square box"},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"sometimes I think it's unnecessary."},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"So I like to go in and just make sure"},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"my dados are spaced nice and evenly,"},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"work out the locations of the shelves,"},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"make sure that the proportions of the top"},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"and bottom decorative pieces look okay,"},"591":{"dur":1,"text":"and maybe even experiment a little bit"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"with different designs\nfor that top and bottom"},"595":{"dur":1,"text":"since that's probably the only place"},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"we're going to get really\ncreative with this project."},"600":{"dur":1,"text":"If you're good at Sketch Up"},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"and you really enjoy using it,"},"602":{"dur":1,"text":"you can do this whole thing from"},"603":{"dur":1,"text":"beginning to end on there."},"605":{"dur":1,"text":"For me, it just takes too much time."},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"I'd rather just use it and get the heck"},"609":{"dur":1,"text":"outta there and start building."},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"So let's hop on the computer."},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"Now I'm just going to\nuse the rectangle tool"},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"to create a few boxes that\nrepresent the tool chest."},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's do 1 section at a time."},"620":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't really know the height,"},"621":{"dur":1,"text":"so let's just say about 30 inches"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"and the width we want\nis 22 and 1\/4 inches."},"625":{"dur":1,"text":"Notice that I'm entering the dimensions"},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"with my keyboard at the\nbottom right of the screen."},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"Now I'm using the rectangle tool to draw"},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"the 3\/4 inch partition that'll be"},"637":{"dur":1,"text":"between the 2 sections of the chest."},"640":{"dur":3,"text":"I can then add the second\n30 x 22, 3\/4 inch section"},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"and then the 2 outside walls of the chest."},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"And just for the sake of visual reference,"},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"let's use the push\/pull tool to pull out"},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"the sides in the partition\njust a few inches."},"661":{"dur":1,"text":"Now what I'm really looking at here"},"662":{"dur":1,"text":"is the total width."},"664":{"dur":1,"text":"I added these numbers up before,"},"666":{"dur":1,"text":"but for some reason, it wasn't until"},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"I saw it in 3D space that it hit me."},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"46 and 1\/4 inches is just too darn wide."},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"It's almost a full 4 feet."},"674":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's back to the drawing board."},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"So horizontal storage, out."},"679":{"dur":1,"text":"We need to come up with\na different solution."},"681":{"dur":1,"text":"How about vertical?"},"683":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, if we store these vertical,"},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"you're going to have a\nlittle bit of a safety issue."},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"You've got to make sure\nthat it's nice and secure."},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"Now I saw this idea on the internet"},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"and I wish I could give\ncredit to the person,"},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"but I don't remember\nexactly where I saw it,"},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"but they were stored vertically"},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"and not on any kind of an incline,"},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"basically right up against the back panel"},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"and there was a little\nwooden clip that you could"},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"rotate around and hold the\nfront end of the plane in place."},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"Now I'm thinking, if you\ncould put a little groove"},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"in the bottom panel as\nwell to catch the back end,"},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"put that into the groove,\npull this thing around,"},"714":{"dur":1,"text":"and now that's gonna\nbe pretty darn stable."},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm actually really happy with that idea."},"718":{"dur":4,"text":"So vertical storage, unless\nyou have endless wall space,"},"722":{"dur":1,"text":"vertical storage seems like the way to go"},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"if you have these longer planes like this."},"726":{"dur":1,"text":"So now I'm looking at the arrangement,"},"729":{"dur":1,"text":"putting everything flat onto the bench,"},"730":{"dur":1,"text":"and seeing what I can\ncome up with that would be"},"732":{"dur":3,"text":"a logical solution for the\nright side of this cabinet."},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, so let's mock up\nthe arrangement here."},"738":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm going to use my purple\ninlay here as a guide,"},"743":{"dur":1,"text":"pretend that's the bottom of the cabinet."},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"Put the #7 in first, #5,"},"748":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm gonna give them about a 1\/2 inch,"},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"maybe a little bit less,\nbetween each plane."},"754":{"dur":1,"text":"Here comes the #4."},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"I get to this point and number one,"},"758":{"dur":3,"text":"I want room to expand so\nI do want some space here."},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't want to go all the\nway to that 22 and 1\/4,"},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"but, you know, I'd like\na little bit more room"},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"just in case I pick up some\nmore planes in the future."},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"For now though, I think I can take"},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"my Blum smoother and lay it this way."},"774":{"dur":1,"text":"That's going to look really cool"},"775":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's still going to be less"},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"than the 22 and 1\/4 that we had before."},"779":{"dur":1,"text":"And let's see what we're looking at."},"781":{"dur":1,"text":"It's about 19 inches."},"782":{"dur":1,"text":"I think I can get away with 19 and 1\/2."},"784":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's say, just to be safe\nand for easy calculation,"},"787":{"dur":3,"text":"20 inches and even at 20,\nwhen you multiply it by 2,"},"791":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm actually losing 4 and\n1\/2 inches on the total width"},"795":{"dur":3,"text":"which brings this down to a\nmuch more reasonable number."},"798":{"dur":1,"text":"The other thing that I\nhave to work with now"},"800":{"dur":2,"text":"is all of this extra\nspace is just going to be"},"802":{"dur":1,"text":"a flat panel that I can work with"},"804":{"dur":2,"text":"which means I could add some of"},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"my more oddball things into this area"},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"using pegs, you know,\nmaybe put some shelves"},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"if I feel so inclined\nto try and figure out"},"814":{"dur":1,"text":"a way to put them in there,"},"816":{"dur":1,"text":"but at the very least, with peg storage,"},"818":{"dur":1,"text":"I could fill up all this extra space"},"819":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's going to look pretty\ndarn cool at the same time."},"822":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think this is a\ngood working arrangement"},"825":{"dur":1,"text":"that we can now go with"},"827":{"dur":1,"text":"so let's head back to the computer."},"829":{"dur":1,"text":"Now we're going to do the same thing"},"831":{"dur":1,"text":"we did last time, only in this case,"},"833":{"dur":2,"text":"we're restricting each\ncompartment to 19 inches."},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"Now the total width is\nonly 40 and 1\/4 inches"},"839":{"dur":2,"text":"which is a 6 inch difference\nfrom the previous design."},"844":{"dur":1,"text":"Now another thing I like\nto use Sketch Up for"},"846":{"dur":2,"text":"is to determine the\nlength of my side pieces."},"848":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm just going to make a very rough sketch"},"850":{"dur":2,"text":"of the arrangement from a side view."},"852":{"dur":1,"text":"So starting from the rear,"},"854":{"dur":2,"text":"we would have a 3\/4 inch\ngap for the French cleat."},"858":{"dur":1,"text":"And now this rectangle\nis going to represent"},"860":{"dur":2,"text":"the back panel at 3\/4 of an inch thick."},"864":{"dur":2,"text":"Next we have a 6 inch\ninternal storage space"},"866":{"dur":2,"text":"which should be plenty\nfor our biggest plane."},"871":{"dur":1,"text":"And now I'm going to draw\nin the sliding doors."},"873":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm giving myself an\nextra 1\/8 inch clearance"},"876":{"dur":2,"text":"and then I'll draw the\nfirst 1\/4 inch door."},"882":{"dur":2,"text":"Now we'll have a 1\/4 inch\ngap between the doors"},"885":{"dur":2,"text":"and then here's our second 1\/4 inch door."},"893":{"dur":1,"text":"Now just to be a little more thorough,"},"894":{"dur":1,"text":"let's draw in the grooves that"},"895":{"dur":1,"text":"the sliding doors will ride in."},"897":{"dur":1,"text":"These are going to be about 1\/4 inch deep."},"902":{"dur":2,"text":"And now from the back to\nthe front of the door,"},"904":{"dur":2,"text":"we have 8 and 3\/8 of an inch."},"907":{"dur":2,"text":"Now for the actual side\npieces of our case,"},"909":{"dur":2,"text":"we're going to want to\nclear those sliding doors"},"911":{"dur":1,"text":"by about 1\/4 of an inch."},"913":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm going to call the\nside pieces 8 and 5\/8."},"919":{"dur":1,"text":"The final thing I need Sketch Up for"},"920":{"dur":1,"text":"is to help me look at a few possibilities"},"922":{"dur":1,"text":"for our top and bottom."},"924":{"dur":1,"text":"So I start by drawing a rectangle"},"925":{"dur":1,"text":"that represents the case itself,"},"927":{"dur":2,"text":"which we know now is 8 and 5\/8 inch deep"},"929":{"dur":2,"text":"by 40 and 1\/4 inches long."},"932":{"dur":2,"text":"The top and bottom will\nextend past the sides"},"934":{"dur":1,"text":"by about an inch and a half"},"935":{"dur":3,"text":"and past the front by about 3 inches."},"939":{"dur":1,"text":"Then I draw the outer rectangle"},"940":{"dur":1,"text":"which represents the rough bottom."},"943":{"dur":2,"text":"Now remember, I'm by no\nmeans a Sketch Up expert"},"945":{"dur":1,"text":"so when I'm experimenting like this"},"946":{"dur":2,"text":"I typically do things that are\nnot considered best practice"},"949":{"dur":2,"text":"in the world of Sketch Up\nand I really don't care."},"952":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm just trying to get\na ballpark visual here"},"954":{"dur":2,"text":"and I know what I need\nto do to get that done."},"957":{"dur":1,"text":"So I think what I want to do is add"},"958":{"dur":1,"text":"a gentle curve to the front"},"960":{"dur":2,"text":"and I start by making reference marks"},"962":{"dur":2,"text":"1 inch back from each front corner."},"965":{"dur":3,"text":"I then take the curve tool\nand I tap each reference mark"},"968":{"dur":3,"text":"that I just created and then\nbring that line to the front"},"971":{"dur":2,"text":"and you can see it gives\nyou a nice curved line."},"976":{"dur":2,"text":"I just erase the little\ndog ears on the corner"},"979":{"dur":1,"text":"and I've got a pretty good representation"},"981":{"dur":1,"text":"of what I'm going for."},"984":{"dur":1,"text":"Now just to get a better visual,"},"985":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to use the push\/pull tool"},"987":{"dur":2,"text":"to extend the center rectangle upward."},"990":{"dur":1,"text":"And now I can see how\nthings are going to look."},"992":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll also extend the bottom down about"},"994":{"dur":0,"text":"an inch and a half since that's"},"995":{"dur":1,"text":"really the thickness that I want."},"1001":{"dur":1,"text":"And that looks pretty good."},"1005":{"dur":2,"text":"Now here's where you can\nstart to play a little."},"1007":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's see how things look if we"},"1009":{"dur":2,"text":"maybe add a curve to the\nsides as well as the front."},"1012":{"dur":1,"text":"Using reference points and the curve tool,"},"1014":{"dur":1,"text":"we can get an idea of whether or not"},"1015":{"dur":1,"text":"this concept even has merit."},"1018":{"dur":1,"text":"Now someone may like that."},"1019":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't think it's what I'm going to use,"},"1021":{"dur":2,"text":"but you can see how you\ncan play with these things"},"1023":{"dur":2,"text":"and just push and pull and\ndo whatever you need to do"},"1026":{"dur":2,"text":"without ever cutting wood\nand you have a pretty"},"1028":{"dur":2,"text":"good idea of what works and what doesn't."},"1032":{"dur":1,"text":"Now I've got just about every dimension"},"1034":{"dur":1,"text":"and every number I could possibly need"},"1036":{"dur":1,"text":"to build this piece."},"1037":{"dur":2,"text":"The one major thing that I haven't"},"1039":{"dur":1,"text":"covered yet is the height."},"1041":{"dur":3,"text":"Now we know that the largest\n#7 plane requires 23 inches."},"1045":{"dur":2,"text":"It's actually 22, but I want\nto give myself a little bit"},"1047":{"dur":1,"text":"of extra clearance and that's going to be"},"1049":{"dur":3,"text":"our vertical internal dimension is 23."},"1052":{"dur":1,"text":"Now I can go with that number,"},"1054":{"dur":2,"text":"but I could also go a little bit taller."},"1056":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is one of those\ncases where I do like"},"1058":{"dur":3,"text":"to go to a design ruler, a\ndesign rule of thumb let's say"},"1062":{"dur":2,"text":"and use something like the Golden Ratio"},"1064":{"dur":2,"text":"to determine what would\nbe the optimal height."},"1067":{"dur":1,"text":"Now if you're not familiar\nwith the Golden Ratio,"},"1069":{"dur":1,"text":"definitely look it up."},"1070":{"dur":1,"text":"You'll see it's referred\nto as the Golden Section,"},"1072":{"dur":1,"text":"the Golden Rectangle."},"1073":{"dur":2,"text":"It basically refers to\nthe relationship between"},"1076":{"dur":4,"text":"two sides of a rectangle in\nterms of how long they are."},"1080":{"dur":1,"text":"So let's say this was 1 inch,"},"1082":{"dur":2,"text":"obviously it's exaggerated,\nthis side is 1 inch,"},"1084":{"dur":2,"text":"and you want to know what would be"},"1086":{"dur":2,"text":"the optimal or most\nvisually pleasing length"},"1089":{"dur":2,"text":"for the long end and what you would do"},"1091":{"dur":2,"text":"is multiply by the Golden Ratio number,"},"1094":{"dur":3,"text":"which is 1.618 and a bunch\nof whole other numbers,"},"1097":{"dur":2,"text":"a bunch of numbers that\nI don't really count."},"1099":{"dur":2,"text":"I just go 1.618 and call it a day."},"1101":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can use that math to determine"},"1104":{"dur":3,"text":"in a situation like\nthis, when it's flexible,"},"1108":{"dur":1,"text":"I could have the height\nwhatever I want it to be,"},"1109":{"dur":1,"text":"it's not a bad idea to do it."},"1111":{"dur":1,"text":"So let's just see what it gives us."},"1113":{"dur":2,"text":"We know that the total\nwidth of this cabinet,"},"1116":{"dur":2,"text":"basically using the top because it's going"},"1119":{"dur":2,"text":"to extend a little bit\nfurther than the case itself,"},"1121":{"dur":3,"text":"so 43 and 1\/4 inches\nwide is where we're at."},"1124":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm going to take 43 and 1\/4"},"1127":{"dur":2,"text":"and in this case I'm\ngoing to divide by 1.618"},"1130":{"dur":2,"text":"because the side to side dimension"},"1132":{"dur":1,"text":"is actually the longer dimension."},"1134":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't want it to be\ntaller than it is wide."},"1136":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm going to divide by 1.618"},"1138":{"dur":4,"text":"and the number I get is 26 and 3\/4"},"1144":{"dur":3,"text":"and that's total height from\nthe top to the very bottom."},"1147":{"dur":2,"text":"Now the top and bottom actual pieces"},"1150":{"dur":2,"text":"are going to be 1 and a 1\/2 inches thick"},"1152":{"dur":4,"text":"so if I take 26 and 3\/4\nand I subtract 3 inches,"},"1157":{"dur":1,"text":"because each one is 1 and a half inches,"},"1159":{"dur":3,"text":"that leaves me with 23 and 3\/4 of an inch"},"1162":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's my internal space."},"1164":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, that's fine because\nI really only need 23."},"1168":{"dur":1,"text":"So if I get 3\/4 of an inch more"},"1169":{"dur":2,"text":"and I hit that Golden\nRatio, why the heck not?"},"1172":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's exactly what we're going to do."},"1174":{"dur":1,"text":"And now really, the only thing left to do"},"1176":{"dur":2,"text":"is gather the materials\nand start making our cuts."},"1179":{"dur":1,"text":"And we'll do that next time."},"1180":{"dur":1,"text":"Thanks for watching."},"1186":{"dur":5,"text":"Nicole:Is to A is to B
