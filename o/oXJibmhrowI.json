know really crude drawing to this wow!"},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, kind of new, elaborate thing."},"784":{"dur":1,"text":"And it was because."},"785":{"dur":4,"text":"Years and years of just

just to\nkeep us quiet or it was a rainy day or"},"892":{"dur":3,"text":"something, you, you thought you\nwere drawing a Superman comic."},"895":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think Mom just said\nshow him how to do it."},"898":{"dur":1,"text":"And so I just basically sat next to you,\nyou know, and"},"900":{"dur":1,"text":"you were drawing a Superman comic."},"901":{"dur":2,"text":"I remember on the

house, and"},"909":{"dur":3,"text":"I thought oh, you, you just drew your own\nyou know, like that, that's kind of cool."},"913":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I thought, well I can't do Superman,\nso, I'm going to create Spaceman."},"917":{"dur":3,"text":"And I remember, you know,\nit's I think I had a ball point pen and,"},"920":{"dur":2,"text":"you know, just typing paper,\nwhatever and I remem-"},"923":{"dur":0,"text":">> Stenographer papers."},"924":{"dur":1,"text":">> Yes, stenographer papers."},"925":{"dur":0,"text":"And, and I just started to."},"926":{"dur":3,"text":"It's and I asked, Marty,\nto spell spaceman for me and"},"929":{"dur":2,"text":"he kind of thought about it,\ngoes okay [LAUGH]."},"932":{"dur":3,"text":"And and I just drew a couple of panels and\nthen I drew a big face of them smiling,"},"935":{"dur":2,"text":"that's all the only stuff\nI remember from it."},"938":{"dur":2,"text":"And we did a few of those, but\nthen we kind of just forgot about it."},"940":{"dur":1,"text":"It was just sort of\na thing to do that day."},"942":{"dur":3,"text":"And then Mario told me he goes,\nhey the guys are doing comics again."},"945":{"dur":1,"text":"I was like what?"},"946":{"dur":3,"text":"And it was a younger brother,\nRicardo and Jaime were making comics."},"950":{"dur":1,"text":"And we didn't even notice that you know,"},"952":{"dur":2,"text":"you know I had just\nforgotten about it kind of."},"954":{"dur":1,"text":">> They were beneath us at the time."},"956":{"dur":1,"text":">> No, they started doing comics again."},"958":{"dur":4,"text":"And so I thought, oh that it's my\nduty to draw comics as well and so"},"962":{"dur":2,"text":"from then on we just started doing comics,\nyou know."},"964":{"dur":2,"text":"Do you remember why you\ndecided to do them?"},"967":{"dur":0,"text":"Just-"},"968":{"dur":1,"text":">> I don't remember what\nyou're talking about [LAUGH]."},"969":{"dur":1,"text":">> Yeah, see he was so\nsmall, we were so young."},"971":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't even know,\nit's so vague, you know?"},"973":{"dur":4,"text":">> I mean it was, you know,\nit was five, the five brothers."},"977":{"dur":3,"text":"So you

cool."},"994":{"dur":5,"text":">> And, and, so, but, you know,\nour, our comics were, back then, or"},"999":{"dur":4,"text":"a little later, were more like\nTurkish superhero movies where,"},"1003":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't know if you've sen any of\nthose where Spiderman versus Godzilla,"},"1006":{"dur":4,"text":"that kind of thing, or Star Trek versus,\nKing Kong, or something."},"1011":{"dur":1,"text":"they, they were like that."},"1013":{"dur":2,"text":"I had Spide Iron Man, fighting the Blob."},"1015":{"dur":4,"text":"Or you know, you'd mix Frankenstein with\nSpiderman or something like that because"},"1019":{"dur":3,"text":"nobody was going to ever see\nthis stuff except us, you know?"},"1022":{"dur":1,"text":"So, that's how we kind of did
