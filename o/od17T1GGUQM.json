[Brigitte] Thank you. [Graeme] How are you"},"84":{"dur":4,"text":"darling? Now you came out with your husband Carl from"},"88":{"dur":4,"text":"Germany, and he was actually a master guilder in Germany."},"92":{"dur":4,"text":"And he came to Australia, so you've been going master, well gilding, for many, many years now"},"96":{"dur":4,"text":"haven't you? [Brigitte] That's right, and we actually"},"100":{"dur":4,"text":"formed Art Gilding as a business [Graeme] Yeah. [Brigitte] in"},"104":{"dur":4,"text":"1976, [Graeme] Okay. [Brigitte] and I always remember"},"108":{"dur":4,"text":"cause it was the year my daughter was born. [Graeme] There you go. But you've got, these days"},"112":{"dur":4,"text":"you teach students and you have master classes [Brigitte] That's correct."},"116":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] right across the year. But you teach people a  variety"},"120":{"dur":4,"text":"of different ways to do leafing, metallic leafing."},"124":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's not just gold leaf is it? There's aluminium"},"128":{"dur":4,"text":"leaf involved, [Brigitte] That's right. [Graeme] copper leaf. Tell me about"},"132":{"dur":4,"text":"the leafing practice itself. I mean how does that come about on its own anyway?"},"136":{"dur":4,"text":"[Brigitte] Right. What actually happened"},"140":{"dur":4,"text":"is we work with a while range of leafs, and today I will"},"144":{"dur":4,"text":"give you an introduction to all the leafs that we're working"},"148":{"dur":4,"text":"with, just to explain what metal"},"152":{"dur":4,"text":"leaf is at all. It"},"156":{"dur":4,"text":"is very thinly beaten metal, and that"},"160":{"dur":4,"text":"is what we're using.[Graeme]  So I'll just get a bit of this over here, [Brigitte] Yep."},"164":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] you can actually see, that's actually what it looks like right there. [Brigitte] That is"},"168":{"dur":4,"text":"copper leaf. [Graeme] That's fascinating stuff isn't it? [Brigitte] Ja, that is copper"},"172":{"dur":4,"text":"leaf, [Graeme] And you've got this one here. [Brigitte] and this one is a"},"176":{"dur":4,"text":"specially [Graeme] Look"},"180":{"dur":4,"text":"at that. [Brigitte] heat treated [Graeme] That's fantastic isn't it? [Brigitte] copper leaf, and both sides"},"184":{"dur":4,"text":"look different from each other. You see that? [Graeme] Yeah, well we're"},"188":{"dur":4,"text":"going to do a few techniques today, but Carl's actually been"},"192":{"dur":4,"text":"or has pre-prepared a plaque that he's actually already put some gold"},"196":{"dur":4,"text":"leaf on. So why don't we move over to where Carl is and actually"},"200":{"dur":4,"text":"he's sort of going to finish that up, but he's going to show us the gold leafing techniques [Brigitte] Yes."},"204":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] that go onto that plaque and then you can talk us through what he's doing. How does that sound? [Brigitte] Yes, will do."},"208":{"dur":4,"text":"I will do that. [Graeme] Lets go and see Carl then."},"216":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] Okay, we're with"},"220":{"dur":4,"text":"master gilder Carl, and he's going to take us through the process. Now you're going to explain"},"224":{"dur":4,"text":"how all of this goes about as well - it's a fascinating process. As you can hear there's a"},"228":{"dur":4,"text":"little bit of traffic behind us as well, we're on one of the main streets in Sydney, which is a fantastic"},"232":{"dur":4,"text":"place for you guys to have your office anyway isn't it? [Brigitte] Absolutely. [Graeme] But explain to us"},"236":{"dur":4,"text":"what Carls about to do now as far as this is concerned? What is this here? What"},"240":{"dur":4,"text":"that red on there? How does this all come about? [Brigitte] That is a special"},"244":{"dur":4,"text":"composition plaque and we are showing you today"},"248":{"dur":4,"text":"how to do a mock water gilding. [Graeme] Okay. [Brigitte] Carl is"},"252":{"dur":4,"text":"actually using a transfer-leaf [Graeme] Okay. [Brigitte] Which means he'll rub"},"256":{"dur":4,"text":"with your fingers. And then the"},"260":{"dur":4,"text":"gold leaf actually transfers to"},"264":{"dur":4,"text":"the actual object. [Graeme] Now there's different types"},"268":{"dur":4,"text":"of leaf as well, as far as the karat is concerned as well."},"272":{"dur":4,"text":"[Brigitte] This is twenty-three karats. [Graeme] That's twenty-three. So this for"},"276":{"dur":4,"text":"inside is that correct? [Brigitte] That's for inside. [Graeme] Okay. [Brigitte] For outside"},"280":{"dur":4,"text":"we use twenty-four karat gold leaf. [Graeme] And some of the things that you've done over the"},"284":{"dur":4,"text":"years are quite fascinating, and we're going to talk about a few of these as we go through the day"},"288":{"dur":4,"text":"while Carl and Brigitte show us their expertise on this."},"292":{"dur":4,"text":"And by the way, these two people here are probably the leading"},"296":{"dur":4,"text":"art gilders in Australia. I mean Carl really"},"300":{"dur":4,"text":"brought his trade out from Germany in 1971 wasn't it?"},"304":{"dur":4,"text":"[Brigitte] That's correct. [Graeme] Yeah and literally, you're not going to find anybody else in this country"},"308":{"dur":4,"text":"as good as these to people here. So I mean if you want to know how to do this, and it's fascinating"},"312":{"dur":4,"text":"I use gold leaf myself and it's just an amazing substance to work with, but"},"316":{"dur":4,"text":"the things that we're going to discuss today are just going to show you"},"320":{"dur":4,"text":"some stuff that you've really never seen before in your life. But in saying that, now"},"324":{"dur":4,"text":"some of your big jobs as well - now doing Buda's in temples."},"328":{"dur":4,"text":"How long did that take to do that? [Brigitte] Carl actually worked in"},"332":{"dur":4,"text":"Braybrook, which is the Quang Minh Temple. [Graeme] Yeah. [Brigitte] And"},"336":{"dur":4,"text":"we only had two weeks to do the work. He had the help"},"340":{"dur":4,"text":"of Monks. The Buda itself was actually"},"344":{"dur":4,"text":"five meters tall and its the largest Buda in Australia. The Monks"},"348":{"dur":4,"text":"helped Carl to complete this job in two weeks because the"},"352":{"dur":4,"text":"Dalai Lama came out and everything had to be finished"},"356":{"dur":4,"text":"for him. [Graeme] That's amazing isn't it. So where do we go from here after you've"},"360":{"dur":4,"text":"actually covered the whole thing, what happens next? [Brigitte] Well the next thing that"},"364":{"dur":4,"text":"happens is that Carl will need now a brush. [Graeme] Okay. [Brigitte] If you could"},"368":{"dur":4,"text":"just hand me that? [Graeme] There you go. [Carl] Thank you.[Brigitte] And he will also use"},"372":{"dur":4,"text":"some gold leaf. We have taken this gold off"},"376":{"dur":4,"text":"when we did other jobs, big jobs and"},"380":{"dur":4,"text":"so we save it. [Graeme] Okay. [Brigitte] So now, to make sure that every"},"384":{"dur":4,"text":"little nick and cranny down there"},"388":{"dur":4,"text":"is being covered, so that's why this is"},"392":{"dur":4,"text":"actually happening now. [Graeme] It's fascinating isn't it? [Brigitte] Yes."},"396":{"dur":4,"text":"And when Carl has finished with brushing this stuff,"},"400":{"dur":4,"text":"the next step that Carl is doing is going to polish this up"},"404":{"dur":4,"text":"to a really brilliant sheen by using cotton wool."},"408":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] It really does shine up doesn't it? [Brigitte] Oh yes. [Graeme] Wow. So these particular"},"412":{"dur":4,"text":"plaque's, I mean obviously when you do your master classes and  your weekend"},"416":{"dur":4,"text":"classes, and as I said guys, the ability that these people"},"420":{"dur":4,"text":"have got is just fantastic, that you can do so many things"},"424":{"dur":4,"text":"with gold leafing, or aluminium leafing, or copper leafing. It's just"},"428":{"dur":4,"text":"particularly for interior designers and just ladies at home that want to have a go"},"432":{"dur":4,"text":"at this it's amazing. But you do a course with students"},"436":{"dur":4,"text":"and today you're going to show us an Egyptian"},"440":{"dur":4,"text":"motif, plaster motif using the various metallic metals"},"444":{"dur":4,"text":"for that. [Brigitte] That's correct. That is actually"},"448":{"dur":4,"text":"our project for our weekend gilding classes. And"},"452":{"dur":4,"text":"that's what we're going to show  [Graeme] Okay."},"456":{"dur":4,"text":"[Brigitte] you today. [Graeme] Well lets go and have look at that, [Brigitte] Yes. [Graeme] because"},"460":{"dur":4,"text":"I think that's amazing and that's just a fantastic technique, but the next one's really going to blow you guys away"},"464":{"dur":4,"text":"it's fantastic."},"468":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] Alright"},"472":{"dur":4,"text":"Carl, now for the second part of our very exciting day, you've obviously got"},"476":{"dur":4,"text":"your plaque laid out there, [Carl] Yes. [Graeme] got a whole bunch of bits and pieces here,"},"480":{"dur":4,"text":"and you've got your gold leaf there. And this is a really interesting part from what he's just told"},"484":{"dur":4,"text":"me. Fire away - what do we do next? [Carl] Now we put the gold leaf on the gilding"},"488":{"dur":4,"text":"on this cushion, [Graeme] Yeah. [Carl] and then you tap it."},"492":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] Ar ha."},"496":{"dur":4,"text":"Look at that. [Carl] You have to do very slow motions otherwise it's gone."},"500":{"dur":4,"text":"And then I cut it, depends what portion"},"504":{"dur":4,"text":"it is. You cut it smaller or this time it's bigger no. So I've cut into"},"508":{"dur":4,"text":"four pieces."},"512":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] And this is"},"516":{"dur":4,"text":"[Carl] I pick it up"},"520":{"dur":4,"text":"and I use to lick every corner to"},"524":{"dur":4,"text":"lacquer, and then you have to make it bigger"},"528":{"dur":4,"text":"with the pieces no. See how it sucks in? [Graeme] Yeah. [Carl] See that?"},"532":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] Oh it just sort of floats into there doesn't it? [Carl] Yeah. [Graeme]  It just sort of slides on."},"536":{"dur":4,"text":"Is there, once you've finished that is there a drying time for"},"540":{"dur":4,"text":"[Carl] Overnight. [Graeme] Yeah okay. You have to let it overnight dry, and now I have to push it,"},"544":{"dur":4,"text":"down, see that? [Graeme] And you just dab that with a? [Carl] Dab it on yeah, with cotton wool."},"548":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] Okay. [Carl] And see how nice and shiny it is started already."},"552":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] Yeah. So Carl, those brushes that you've got, [Carl] Yeah. [Graeme] were do you"},"556":{"dur":4,"text":"get those from? Are they specifically made for this type of work? [Carl] We get them from Germany."},"560":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] And they're specifically made for gilding? [Carl] For the gilding, that's"},"564":{"dur":4,"text":"right. [Graeme] And these are the techniques that you teach all your [Carl] Yes. [Graeme]  pupils in your"},"568":{"dur":11,"text":"master classes as well. [Carl] That's right. [Graeme] Is that there's a whole lot of tiny little things that you would never expect in your particular industry, just little things that you could only learn by experience."},"580":{"dur":4,"text":"[Carl] That's exactly right. [Graeme] Your apprenticeship or your [Carl] Yeah."},"584":{"dur":4,"text":"degree journey, how long did it take you to do that? You know how long"},"588":{"dur":4,"text":"take you to become a master gilder? [Carl] Oh, you have yo learn three years. [Graeme] Three"},"592":{"dur":4,"text":"years okay. [Carl] And then you make your, after that a year"},"596":{"dur":4,"text":"also tradesman, and after that you're"},"600":{"dur":4,"text":"mastered your degree. I'm sure it's in all the European countries"},"604":{"dur":4,"text":"the same. [Graeme] Okay Carl, I can see you've got your size here,"},"608":{"dur":4,"text":"a water based size, [Carl] Yes. [Graeme] to be able to find out where you're going when you're putting down"},"612":{"dur":4,"text":"your layers, you actually add a little bit of food coloring. [Carl] That's right. [Graeme] Okay, not too much."},"616":{"dur":4,"text":"[Carl] No. [Graeme] Just enough to know you're there. [Carl] Yeah, just that you can"},"620":{"dur":4,"text":"see it, you know. [Graeme] Ah, there you go. So as you can see with the"},"624":{"dur":4,"text":"food coloring you're really going to be able to map out where you need"},"628":{"dur":4,"text":"to go with the project. [Carl] That's right. And because it's a high gloss acrylics, so you"},"632":{"dur":4,"text":"mix it very hard and that's white normally. [Graeme] Yeah, cause this"},"636":{"dur":4,"text":"stuff drys clear anyway doesn't it? [Carl] Yes it does, but not with the food coloring."},"640":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] Oh Okay. [Carl] Once the food coloring is stable and we"},"644":{"dur":4,"text":"dry it off with the hair dryer; we don't have to wait fifteen minutes. [Graeme] Sure, sure."},"648":{"dur":4,"text":"And is that about the general dying time of the size? [Carl] Yeah, fifteen minutes."},"652":{"dur":4,"text":"That's right. And then it right through this one now, probably about"},"656":{"dur":4,"text":"longer. But to overcome that problem you can dry with the hair dryer, you know. [Graeme] Okay."},"660":{"dur":4,"text":"The beauty about doing your course is that you get a variety of people [Carl] That's"},"664":{"dur":4,"text":"right. [Graeme] that are involved. I mean you've got artists, a lot of [Carl] Yes. [Graeme] artists do it. [Carl] A lot of artists yes."},"668":{"dur":4,"text":"Because it's a fantastic way to build a different idea in"},"672":{"dur":4,"text":"to your work as well. [Carl] That's right. [Graeme] And then obviously interior designers,"},"676":{"dur":4,"text":"architects, a number of different people. [Carl] And even if the"},"680":{"dur":4,"text":"architects only do the weekend class, or interior designer, at least they"},"684":{"dur":4,"text":"know what has to be done before the gold comes on,"},"688":{"dur":4,"text":"so they have got the product knowledge, no. [Graeme] Your business"},"692":{"dur":4,"text":"really is a one stop shop for everybody. They can get their supplies through"},"696":{"dur":4,"text":"you as well. [Carl] That's right. [Graeme] So if you do the course, you actually get I think it's"},"700":{"dur":4,"text":"a twenty percent discount as well isn't it? [Carl] Yeah, that's right. [Graeme] So you've got so many"},"704":{"dur":4,"text":"advantages of being involved with what Carl and Brigitte do, and they're just"},"708":{"dur":4,"text":"fantastic teachers and you know, I can thoroughly recommend if you want"},"712":{"dur":4,"text":"to do this particularly as artists, [Carl] Yeah. [Graeme] I think it's just fantastic. I use gold leaf"},"716":{"dur":4,"text":"myself, but this is just amazing to be able to learn from these people. [Carl] Once you"},"720":{"dur":4,"text":"hooked, you're hooked for your life. [Graeme] But it's so diverse that"},"724":{"dur":4,"text":"the things that you can do with it as well. Three dimensional objects, [Carl] Yes. [Graeme] two dimensional"},"728":{"dur":4,"text":"[Carl] Yeah, I mean it's look, it's, you can create new"},"732":{"dur":4,"text":"things you know, you've never thought of it you know. [Graeme] Yeah. [Carl] I'm always"},"736":{"dur":4,"text":"telling my students if you find something else let me know, we can share it"},"740":{"dur":4,"text":"around with other people if they want to learn. [Graeme] Okay Carl, now that you've done that"},"744":{"dur":4,"text":"and it's dried, [Carl] Yes. [Graeme] because your darling wife is also a master gilder, and I think"},"748":{"dur":4,"text":"and I think it's great to see both sides of these guys work as a team, how about we let"},"752":{"dur":4,"text":"Brigitte come in and she can work on the rest of this, [Carl] Fantastic. [Graeme] and we'll go from there"},"756":{"dur":4,"text":"so."},"760":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] Okay Brigitte, the next master"},"764":{"dur":4,"text":"gilder is here to continue, so we've got - is that aluminium?"},"768":{"dur":4,"text":"[Brigitte] This is aluminium leaf. [Graeme] Okay. The gloves obviously help to"},"772":{"dur":4,"text":"stop it sticking. [Brigitte] I wear gloves; the reason I wear gloves is"},"776":{"dur":4,"text":"because I feel much more comfortable picking up the leafs. [Graeme] Okay. [Brigitte] So what I"},"780":{"dur":4,"text":"do, I actually lay the leaf double, and when I do that"},"784":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] Yeah. [Brigitte] I will put it right over this area here. [Graeme] Yeah."},"788":{"dur":4,"text":"[Brigitte] I will press it on, and then push it in."},"792":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] Oh. [Brigitte] Look at that. [Graeme] Yeah. [Brigitte] See."},"796":{"dur":4,"text":"Easy. [Graeme] So the double surface on the top helps get the little bits [Brigitte] That's right."},"800":{"dur":4,"text":"to the bottom of the surface does it? [Brigitte] And the leaf will only ever stick"},"804":{"dur":4,"text":"where we have the size [Graeme] Okay. [Brigitte] as well as"},"808":{"dur":4,"text":"the leaf will only ever adhere once,"},"812":{"dur":4,"text":"and then I just go with my hands like that. [Graeme] That makes perfect sense. [Brigitte] Well done."},"816":{"dur":4,"text":"So now we're going to do the hair. We'll just cover the whole plaque now. [Graeme] Okay."},"820":{"dur":4,"text":"I see. [Brigitte] With the leaf [Graeme] Yep. [Brigitte] I'll lay that double."},"824":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] Oh that's beautiful. [Brigitte] and as I said, it'll only sticking on"},"828":{"dur":4,"text":"the decoration, because for the decoration we're actually going to"},"832":{"dur":4,"text":"use another leaf. [Graeme] Okay. [Brigitte] Then I go and"},"836":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] Pushing it in. [Brigitte] so I'll just push it in, you see, where we're going to"},"840":{"dur":4,"text":"have a decoration later on around the ear, [Graeme] Yep. [Brigitte] no problem."},"844":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] But the difference being with the genuine gold and this"},"848":{"dur":4,"text":"is there is a bit of a cost difference. [Brigitte] Oh, a bit?"},"852":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] Just a tad. [Brigitte] Yes, quite a lot. [Graeme] Yeah. [Brigitte] The most experience"},"856":{"dur":4,"text":"one is the twenty-four karat double gold leaf, which is"},"860":{"dur":4,"text":"used for exterior, and sometimes we do some nice gilding with that."},"864":{"dur":4,"text":"And the twenty-three karat gold"},"868":{"dur":4,"text":"leaf is slightly cheaper and is used for"},"872":{"dur":4,"text":"interiors. And then it's a matter of choice if you want to use real"},"876":{"dur":4,"text":"gold or the false gold. The false gold or faux"},"880":{"dur":4,"text":"gold is called dutch metal leaf, and it comes in sheets"},"884":{"dur":4,"text":"of sixteen centimetres square. [Graeme] So if anybody wants to"},"888":{"dur":4,"text":"get any of these great materials for a start, and also I"},"892":{"dur":4,"text":"strongly suggest you come along and do one of the courses with Brigitte and Carl because"},"896":{"dur":4,"text":"this stuff is fascinating. You website address is my dear? [Brigitte] art gilding"},"900":{"dur":4,"text":"dot com dot au. [Graeme] There you go guys. And honestly, come in"},"904":{"dur":4,"text":"because these people are the best in the country at doing this. [Brigitte] There's a"},"908":{"dur":4,"text":"another reason, a very important reason that I actually want to state for"},"912":{"dur":4,"text":"wearing gloves. And that is when you work"},"916":{"dur":4,"text":"with dutch metal leaf, dutch metal leaf is actually"},"920":{"dur":4,"text":"a brass leaf, and when you would"},"924":{"dur":4,"text":"touch your, the dutch metal with your fingers"},"928":{"dur":4,"text":"and you have moisture on it, you'll actually mark the area"},"932":{"dur":4,"text":"because it's brass. So wearing gloves prevents you"},"936":{"dur":4,"text":"from tarnishing your leaf"},"940":{"dur":4,"text":"while you work with it. So the next step now is that"},"944":{"dur":4,"text":"I use the word cutting-in, that means we're going with"},"948":{"dur":4,"text":"one against the next leaf here. I also"},"952":{"dur":4,"text":"find that when you have to"},"956":{"dur":4,"text":"do things that under-cut"},"960":{"dur":4,"text":"it is very helpful if you move your brush"},"964":{"dur":4,"text":"basically in a circular motion with the tips"},"968":{"dur":4,"text":"down. That way you cover everything. [Graeme] You"},"972":{"dur":4,"text":"also did the chariot for the 2000 Olympics as well. [Brigitte] Oh yeah."},"976":{"dur":4,"text":"Yes. [Graeme] How long did it take to put the gold leaf on that chariot? [Brigitte] We"},"980":{"dur":4,"text":"worked literally for weeks. [Graeme] Oh goodness. [Brigitte] We were absolutely"},"984":{"dur":4,"text":"thrilled to be part of this beautiful"},"988":{"dur":4,"text":"project. [Graeme] Okay, well you're going to be using this next"},"992":{"dur":4,"text":"leaf here [Brigitte] Correct. [Graeme] to do what you're doing. So what we might do"},"996":{"dur":4,"text":"is we might just let you actually just do that, and we'll watch you through the process then. [Brigitte] Okay."},"1012":{"dur":4,"text":"[Graeme] Okay well that's fantastic what you just did there, but"},"1016":{"dur":4,"text":"you've just picked a bottle of turps. What do you want the turps for? [Brigitte] I'll go"},"1020":{"dur":4,"text":"around the outside edges here [Graeme] Yeah. [Brigitte] to tidy them up, to"},"1024":{"dur":4,"text":"clean them up. See, I can just move it along the"},"1028":{"dur":4,"text":"edge here and I get a really nice crisp edge."},"1032":{"dur":4,"text":"Because the rest of the white, [Graeme] Yeah. [Brigitte] when I put the antiquing"},"1036":{"dur":4,"text":"over it, will actually become like a stone finish."},"1040":{"dur":4,"text":"So that's why I want to clean it up a little bit"},"1044":{"dur":4,"text":"to make it look a bit more professional. [Graeme] Okay, now the next  section"},"1048":{"dur":4,"text":"you are about to do is? [Brigitte] Is I am going to seal"},"1052":{"dur":4,"text":"these areas that I have gilded in,"},"1056":{"dur":4,"text":"except for the water-gilder because that needs to be burnished. [Graeme] Okay."},"1060":{"dur":4,"text":"[Brigitte] And there's still some areas that need to be fixed. [Graeme] Okay. [Brigitte] So"},"1064":{"dur":4,"text":"here I go. [Graeme] So what's the idea of actually doing this with the shellac? What's it"},"1068":{"dur":4,"text":"suppose to do? Well have got actually have two choices, if you want to keep that"},"1072":{"dur":4,"text":"silver very, very light"},"1076":{"dur":4,"text":"light looking, you would be using the deepak shellac."},"1080":{"dur":4,"text":"but if you use the orange shellac, you're going to"},"1084":{"dur":4,"text":"get a yellow finish. Now I'm also going to"},"1088":{"dur":4,"text":"put this straight"},"1092":{"dur":4,"text":"over the outside edges, because it gives that really"},"1096":{"dur":4,"text":"aged look, [Graeme] It looks like old sandstone. [Brigitte] very aged look."},"1100":{"dur":4,"text":"Yeah, like old sandstone, yes. [Graeme] So there's another process"},"1104":{"dur":4,"text":"after this one? [Brigitte] Yes, [Graeme] Okay. [Brigitte] because the next process"},"1108":{"dur":4,"text":"that we're going to put in, is that"},"1112":{"dur":4,"text":"after we have sealed it, we are going to make it look"},"1116":{"dur":4,"text":"a hundred years old, a thousand years old, not quite."},"1120":{"dur":4,"text":"But we'll make it a, we'll make it a hundred"},"1124":{"dur":4,"text":"years old.
