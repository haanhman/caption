A\nCity of International Success."},"50":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm Doctor Maha Gingrich."},"52":{"dur":3,"text":"Today, our guess is\nCasimiro Liborio,"},"55":{"dur":3,"text":"and he's the Vice President\nand General Manager"},"58":{"dur":2,"text":"of Gerdau Steel Mill Charlotte."},"60":{"dur":1,"text":"Welcome to our show."},"62":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you very\nmuch for having me."},"63":{"dur":4,"text":"Oh, it's a pleasure having you."},"68":{"dur":2,"text":"I would like to\nspend a lot of time"},"70":{"dur":3,"text":"in talking about the\nsteel mill industry that's"},"73":{"dur":1,"text":"here and the impact."},"75":{"dur":1,"text":"And some of the\nthings I have learned"},"76":{"dur":2,"text":"talking to you before the\nshow totally amazed me."},"79":{"dur":3,"text":"So to start off with,\nas we always ask,"},"83":{"dur":1,"text":"you're originally from Brazil?"},"84":{"dur":0,"text":"Correct, from Brazil."},"85":{"dur":1,"text":"And what part of Brazil?"},"87":{"dur":4,"text":"It's Northeast Brazil, so it's\na small city called Petrolina."},"91":{"dur":2,"text":"MAHA GINGRICH: Petrolina--\ndo they do petrol?"},"93":{"dur":0,"text":"No, no."},"94":{"dur":6,"text":"No petrol It's a indigenous\nname from beautiful rock."},"101":{"dur":4,"text":"And basically it's a place\nwhere we have a river."},"105":{"dur":4,"text":"It's a big river called\nSt. Francis River."},"109":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's a very\ndry area of Brazil"},"113":{"dur":3,"text":"greatly now because\nof irrigation."},"116":{"dur":4,"text":"It became a very, very\nbig producer of fruits,"},"120":{"dur":3,"text":"and agriculture is very\nstrong there, actually."},"124":{"dur":1,"text":"I would have never\nimagined Petrolina."},"126":{"dur":3,"text":"Lina I think I'd just think\nof the standard meaning."},"130":{"dur":2,"text":"But once you explain,\nthat makes perfect sense."},"132":{"dur":1,"text":"That sounds really beautiful."},"134":{"dur":2,"text":"Now did your parents\nwork in that field?"},"136":{"dur":0,"text":"Or?"},"137":{"dur":6,"text":"My dad ended up being a\nfertilizer salesmen, which--"},"143":{"dur":0,"text":"Make's sense."},"144":{"dur":1,"text":"--it made a lot of sense."},"145":{"dur":2,"text":"There was a lot of\nneed during that time,"},"148":{"dur":4,"text":"because the agricultural\nindustry was growing quite fast"},"152":{"dur":0,"text":"in that region."},"153":{"dur":5,"text":"So it was very, very good\nfor us, for our family."},"158":{"dur":1,"text":"What about your mom?"},"160":{"dur":1,"text":"My mom?"},"161":{"dur":3,"text":"She was a teacher, a\nmiddle school teacher"},"165":{"dur":6,"text":"and basically retired\nearly because to be"},"172":{"dur":2,"text":"able to take care of us."},"174":{"dur":0,"text":"Us."},"175":{"dur":2,"text":"How many of \"us\" is\nshe taking care of?"},"177":{"dur":0,"text":"Nine."},"178":{"dur":1,"text":"MAHA GINGRICH: You\nhave nine siblings?"},"180":{"dur":1,"text":"CASIMIRO LIBORIO:\nEight siblings."},"181":{"dur":2,"text":"Eight siblings with you."},"184":{"dur":2,"text":"It is amazing to me."},"186":{"dur":2,"text":"Any woman who can\ndo that and take"},"189":{"dur":3,"text":"care of the house\nand nine children"},"193":{"dur":2,"text":"ages-- I have so much\nrespect for that."},"195":{"dur":0,"text":"Absolutely."},"196":{"dur":3,"text":"And we loved her so\nmuch because of that."},"199":{"dur":4,"text":"And it was a different time."},"204":{"dur":5,"text":"I believe if it was today, we\nwould not have so many brothers"},"209":{"dur":1,"text":"and sisters."},"210":{"dur":2,"text":"When you have that many--\nit's like joint families."},"213":{"dur":2,"text":"Many have families\ntogether-- people together--"},"215":{"dur":1,"text":"in the same house."},"217":{"dur":4,"text":"You just learn to share, and\nyou learn to play with them."},"221":{"dur":4,"text":"And they become your best\nfriends just growing up I"},"225":{"dur":0,"text":"would think."},"226":{"dur":0,"text":"That's very true."},"227":{"dur":0,"text":"--in your case?"},"228":{"dur":0,"text":"Yes, very true."},"229":{"dur":1,"text":"So you went to school\nthere, obviously."},"231":{"dur":1,"text":"I went to school there."},"232":{"dur":8,"text":"So again, Northeast Brazil\nis a very undeveloped area"},"241":{"dur":0,"text":"of Brazil."},"242":{"dur":5,"text":"So it's the poorest area\nof the country and because"},"247":{"dur":5,"text":"of the climate as well-- so\nvery, very hard on the people."},"253":{"dur":1,"text":"And over the years,\nthere was a lot"},"254":{"dur":5,"text":"of migration, folks coming\ninto the big cities of Brazil"},"260":{"dur":2,"text":"to find better\nliving conditions."},"263":{"dur":1,"text":"MAHA GINGRICH: And\nthat makes sense."},"264":{"dur":4,"text":"But still, it's\ngrowing and it's"},"269":{"dur":4,"text":"a nice area where I could\nlive for about nine years."},"273":{"dur":5,"text":"We moved to the capital of the\nstate which is at the coast."},"278":{"dur":5,"text":"So it's Recife, which in\nPortuguese means reef,"},"284":{"dur":2,"text":"because there is a\nreef barrier there"},"287":{"dur":5,"text":"that was used for port when the\nPortuguese colonized Brazil."},"292":{"dur":7,"text":"So because in my original city\nthere was no universities,"},"300":{"dur":4,"text":"no colleges, and\nmy parents really"},"304":{"dur":3,"text":"wanted us to have\na good education"},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"so they moved to Recife."},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"Wow, so they really\nbelieve in education."},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes, absolutely."},"314":{"dur":4,"text":"And my dad was traveling\nback to the region"},"318":{"dur":5,"text":"where I was born to sell\nfertilizer at that point."},"323":{"dur":1,"text":"And so it was a\nlot of traveling,"},"325":{"dur":4,"text":"and we stayed there\nstudying and trying to--"},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"Now I know that public\neducation is free."},"336":{"dur":1,"text":"It's possible."},"337":{"dur":3,"text":"We have public\nuniversities that are free."},"341":{"dur":0,"text":"Oh, really?"},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"Public universities, yes."},"344":{"dur":1,"text":"Higher education is free."},"345":{"dur":3,"text":"And there is one\nuniversity basically"},"349":{"dur":3,"text":"for-- or in some\ncases, more than one"},"352":{"dur":5,"text":"depending on the city--\nwhere you have to apply."},"358":{"dur":3,"text":"And then there is a\nvery competitive test."},"362":{"dur":3,"text":"And if you pass, you are able\nto get a free education--"},"365":{"dur":3,"text":"and high quality education\nbecause the federal government"},"369":{"dur":1,"text":"spends a lot of time."},"370":{"dur":5,"text":"Basic education is basically\nfree if you want to."},"376":{"dur":5,"text":"But it's not good,\nand so you have"},"381":{"dur":3,"text":"to try to have some\nbetter education."},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"And there are a lot\nof options for schools"},"388":{"dur":8,"text":"that are paid-- so religious\ninstitutions or in some cases"},"397":{"dur":4,"text":"institutions that you pay\nand you get better teachers."},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"I would think it would\ncost a lot for your parents."},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"It was a lot of\neffort from my parents"},"408":{"dur":3,"text":"to put us through\nhaving good education"},"411":{"dur":4,"text":"and be able to do\nsucceed in life."},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a very big commitment\nthat you have to make."},"418":{"dur":4,"text":"And I believe that the move\nfrom a city where it's small,"},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"you basically know\neveryone, and you"},"426":{"dur":3,"text":"have all the support you\nneed to the capital to state"},"429":{"dur":5,"text":"where you basically are, as a\nfamily, you are on your own."},"434":{"dur":4,"text":"And you have to discover all\nthe new things with nine kids."},"439":{"dur":3,"text":"And my youngest one at that\ntime was less than one-year-old."},"442":{"dur":1,"text":"Oh, jeez."},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"So it was very tough\nbut commendable."},"447":{"dur":6,"text":"And we moved there when my\noldest brother was one year,"},"454":{"dur":6,"text":"was entering the senior year in\nhigh school and to be able to--"},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"That's a big move in many ways."},"463":{"dur":5,"text":"So you're saying it's not only\na sacrifice on your parents side"},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"trying to really\nsupport, but they"},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"believe so much\nin your education"},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"they wanted to make that change."},"475":{"dur":4,"text":"And then you had\nto-- all the children"},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"and the parents-- had to\nmake a lot of adjustments"},"483":{"dur":4,"text":"because it's very different\nfrom that cozy environment"},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"that you were born and\nbrought up in for nine years."},"489":{"dur":3,"text":"What inspired you\nto go to college?"},"493":{"dur":3,"text":"Obviously, your parents\nbelieve in education."},"496":{"dur":0,"text":"Yes."},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"But to select your fields."},"500":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah."},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"My mom was a teacher."},"504":{"dur":5,"text":"My dad had only a high school\neducation or less, I believe."},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"And he had some jobs\nthat, for example,"},"513":{"dur":1,"text":"as supermarket manager."},"514":{"dur":4,"text":"And I believe that\ninside, they wanted"},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"us to have a better future."},"521":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think the\ninspiration that my dad"},"526":{"dur":3,"text":"brought to me was-- and\nmy mom as well-- was never"},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"to be afraid to work."},"531":{"dur":6,"text":"So work is something that\nmakes you be a better person."},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you have better\nindication, of course,"},"540":{"dur":1,"text":"you're going to\nhave the opportunity"},"541":{"dur":3,"text":"to have better\nwork, better jobs."},"544":{"dur":7,"text":"And so this is where I believe\nwas the big push we had."},"552":{"dur":4,"text":"What a great value\nsystem and inspiration."},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"Don't be afraid of work."},"559":{"dur":1,"text":"And if you have\nthe right balance"},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"of education, personality,\nqualities-- everything that"},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"comes together--\nyou will succeed."},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's what you're\nsaying is the message there."},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"So you went to college."},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"What degree did you pursue?"},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"I did mechanical\nengineering, OK?"},"577":{"dur":4,"text":"And just to go\nback a little bit,"},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm the fifth in my family."},"584":{"dur":4,"text":"So we had my older brothers\nand sisters and four"},"589":{"dur":4,"text":"ahead of me and four after me."},"593":{"dur":8,"text":"My first brother went to school\nto be computer science major."},"602":{"dur":4,"text":"My second went to\nbe a civil engineer."},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"And my sister-- she's a doctor."},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"She went to go to\nmedical school."},"612":{"dur":4,"text":"And my brother before me was\na civil engineer as well."},"617":{"dur":5,"text":"So I said I don't want to\nbe another civil engineer"},"622":{"dur":3,"text":"So I was looking for\nsome opportunities."},"626":{"dur":7,"text":"I always liked the mechanics\nof it-- the how things work,"},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's very interesting."},"635":{"dur":5,"text":"I remember well living as\na young kid in Petrolina"},"640":{"dur":5,"text":"that I would take my bike\nand go to the airport, which"},"646":{"dur":1,"text":"was very close at that time."},"647":{"dur":3,"text":"There was no walls\nand fences installed."},"650":{"dur":5,"text":"So you could get very\nclose to the air mail"},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"plane that was\ncoming-- I don't know--"},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"twice a week for the city."},"660":{"dur":6,"text":"And it could be fascinating for\nhow things work but also where"},"667":{"dur":4,"text":"it could take you, where those\nairplanes could take you."},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"Wow, so you were\nreally dreaming big?"},"674":{"dur":5,"text":"And then I looked\nat the fields, and I"},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"felt that mechanical engineering\ncould be something good for me."},"683":{"dur":3,"text":"I always look at\nthose things and also"},"686":{"dur":1,"text":"look at industries we have."},"688":{"dur":6,"text":"In our region, it's not a\nvery industrialized region."},"694":{"dur":6,"text":"But there was a lot of sugar\ncane distilleries and mills."},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"And I said OK, maybe\nthere is something"},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"that will interest me."},"705":{"dur":4,"text":"So I applied, and\nI was approved."},"709":{"dur":0,"text":"It's competitive."},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"It was very competitive."},"712":{"dur":5,"text":"At that time, it was 18\nto 1, 18 people to 1."},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"So what was your first\njob after you graduated?"},"720":{"dur":4,"text":"It was working as a intern\npart time at ExxonMobile"},"725":{"dur":11,"text":"actually, a petroleum company,\nat a tank farm at our city."},"736":{"dur":6,"text":"So there was receiving\ngasoline, and other oil,"},"742":{"dur":3,"text":"and some other\nproducts into the farm"},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"and then distributing\nto the gas stations."},"749":{"dur":4,"text":"So my job there was to-- with\nmy engineering expertise--"},"754":{"dur":3,"text":"but also learning how\nthe business worked."},"757":{"dur":3,"text":"At my graduation, they offered\nme a full time job there."},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"MAHA GINGRICH: Oh, nice."},"762":{"dur":6,"text":"But I decided to follow a\ntechnical career because I"},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"spent five years--"},"771":{"dur":1,"text":"The internship and all that."},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"--in engineering school."},"775":{"dur":6,"text":"And then job at ExxonMobile\nwas more administrative"},"782":{"dur":0,"text":"than anything."},"783":{"dur":0,"text":"Oh, I see."},"784":{"dur":7,"text":"And then I had an opportunity\nto go to another company that"},"792":{"dur":4,"text":"is a cement factory actually\nbut a unit of that factory that"},"796":{"dur":3,"text":"built equipment for\nthe cement industry."},"800":{"dur":6,"text":"So I went there to be a project\nengineer-- the design of things"},"807":{"dur":3,"text":"and to make sure\nthings were according"},"810":{"dur":4,"text":"to the drawings and then the\nmanufacturing process as well."},"815":{"dur":1,"text":"So it put your\neducation to work."},"816":{"dur":0,"text":"Yes."},"817":{"dur":1,"text":"Directly."},"819":{"dur":2,"text":"And that makes sense\nfor you to switch that."},"821":{"dur":1,"text":"Because you can\nactually-- everything"},"823":{"dur":3,"text":"you have learned instead of\ndoing administrative positions,"},"826":{"dur":3,"text":"you can actually make it happen,\nand visualize, and implement"},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"what you have learned."},"832":{"dur":1,"text":"Then what'd you do?"},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"And then shortly\nafter that, there"},"837":{"dur":2,"text":"was an opportunity at\nGerdau, the company"},"840":{"dur":1,"text":"that I work at today."},"841":{"dur":1,"text":"So this was a long time ago."},"843":{"dur":6,"text":"So now actually this year\nis going to be 28 years--"},"849":{"dur":1,"text":"28 years with the company?"},"850":{"dur":1,"text":"--working for this company."},"851":{"dur":0,"text":"Congratulations."},"852":{"dur":1,"text":"Oh, thank you very much."},"853":{"dur":1,"text":"Wow, what an achievement."},"855":{"dur":4,"text":"There was an opportunity,\nand it was in the engineering"},"859":{"dur":6,"text":"field, where I could really--\nI was good at that time"},"865":{"dur":0,"text":"with drawings."},"866":{"dur":2,"text":"And I decided to\ngo for it, and I"},"869":{"dur":5,"text":"was selected as a\nproject engineer,"},"874":{"dur":2,"text":"as a management\nassociated at that time."},"877":{"dur":2,"text":"And so--"},"879":{"dur":0,"text":"There you are."},"880":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah, your journey begins."},"882":{"dur":4,"text":"When did you meet your\nwife, and how did you"},"886":{"dur":4,"text":"So actually it was\nbefore I graduated."},"891":{"dur":2,"text":"At that time, our\nengineering classes"},"893":{"dur":3,"text":"were very technicall--\nvery, very concentrated"},"897":{"dur":6,"text":"on the calculus, the resistance,\nthe math, and the materials,"},"903":{"dur":1,"text":"and stuff."},"905":{"dur":6,"text":"And I was feeling the\nneed for the informatics--"},"911":{"dur":3,"text":"the computer science that\nwas at the very beginning"},"915":{"dur":1,"text":"stages of that time."},"917":{"dur":3,"text":"So I decided to apply\nto a second college"},"920":{"dur":2,"text":"while I was doing engineering."},"923":{"dur":1,"text":"And it was computer science."},"924":{"dur":2,"text":"So I applied, took\nthe same test."},"927":{"dur":3,"text":"I passed, and I studied\ncomputer science at college."},"931":{"dur":1,"text":"Oh, wow-- busy."},"932":{"dur":4,"text":"And then this is where I\nmet my lovely wife-- there."},"936":{"dur":5,"text":"She passed, and she was\nstarting the college"},"942":{"dur":1,"text":"for computer science."},"943":{"dur":4,"text":"And she graduated\nfive years later."},"947":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I-- at\nsome point in time"},"950":{"dur":4,"text":"was so hard to manage those\ntwo schools at the same time"},"954":{"dur":5,"text":"that I decided to drop off the\npart of the computer science"},"959":{"dur":2,"text":"and concentrate on\nthe engineering."},"962":{"dur":2,"text":"I know at some point\nyou moved to Salvador--"},"965":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes, I moved to another city--"},"966":{"dur":1,"text":"--with your family."},"967":{"dur":4,"text":"And was only my\nwife and I, which"},"972":{"dur":3,"text":"was a very interesting\nand challenging move."},"978":{"dur":3,"text":"My wife-- we are\nnine in my house."},"981":{"dur":1,"text":"My wife is the only child."},"983":{"dur":0,"text":"Oh."},"984":{"dur":5,"text":"So you can imagine\nto take the only child"},"990":{"dur":1,"text":"and move to another city."},"991":{"dur":6,"text":"So it was very hard on her\nfamily and hard on her as well."},"997":{"dur":3,"text":"Because she had life very\nwell established there."},"1001":{"dur":6,"text":"She had a very good job in a\nsupermarket in the computer"},"1007":{"dur":6,"text":"science department and\nworking on the credit system"},"1014":{"dur":4,"text":"that the supermarket was just\nimplementing-- and interesting"},"1018":{"dur":0,"text":"job."},"1019":{"dur":3,"text":"And then she had to quit that\nand move with me to Salvador."},"1022":{"dur":1,"text":"Sacrifice on her side."},"1024":{"dur":3,"text":"And very, very\ndifficult for us."},"1028":{"dur":4,"text":"But good because Salvador\nwas a very nice city."},"1032":{"dur":3,"text":"It's in the Northeast\nregion of Brazil,"},"1035":{"dur":6,"text":"but it's a one hour flight\naway from our original city."},"1042":{"dur":2,"text":"So you enjoyed your\nstay in Salvador?"},"1044":{"dur":0,"text":"We did."},"1045":{"dur":0,"text":"We did enjoy it."},"1046":{"dur":2,"text":"Our two daughters\nwere born there."},"1048":{"dur":1,"text":"MAHA GINGRICH: Oh, OK."},"1049":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's a good thing."},"1052":{"dur":0,"text":"Family time."},"1053":{"dur":2,"text":"Yes."},"1055":{"dur":2,"text":"So it was a lot of work."},"1057":{"dur":3,"text":"Gerdau just acquired\na company-- a company"},"1060":{"dur":4,"text":"that used to be run by the\ngovernment in Salvador."},"1065":{"dur":2,"text":"And we had to go\nthere and rebuild."},"1068":{"dur":3,"text":"And so it was a lot of work."},"1071":{"dur":1,"text":"A lot of work."},"1072":{"dur":2,"text":"So you had your family and\nthen you're working very hard."},"1075":{"dur":2,"text":"How did you end up\nin the United States?"},"1077":{"dur":6,"text":"Well my initial\nwork was engineering,"},"1084":{"dur":2,"text":"was to put things\ntogether, which"},"1086":{"dur":7,"text":"it's a field that is not a very\nspecific field to the steel"},"1094":{"dur":1,"text":"industry."},"1095":{"dur":3,"text":"During my stay in Salvador\nI was invited by my boss."},"1099":{"dur":3,"text":"He said well, you have\nto move to production"},"1102":{"dur":3,"text":"so we can be more\nspecialized in production."},"1106":{"dur":1,"text":"And I said I don't want to."},"1107":{"dur":2,"text":"I love what I do,\nbut he said no, go."},"1110":{"dur":3,"text":"Our company's going\nto grow, and we're"},"1113":{"dur":3,"text":"going to need more capacity\nin the production site."},"1117":{"dur":3,"text":"So I went to the\narea that we call"},"1121":{"dur":3,"text":"the rolling mill, which I\nnever worked there before"},"1124":{"dur":3,"text":"but was very interesting\nwhere I could really"},"1128":{"dur":6,"text":"be a new set of eyes, make an\nimpact in that production area."},"1134":{"dur":4,"text":"So I want to talk really\nabout the steel industry"},"1138":{"dur":3,"text":"that we have now in Charlotte."},"1142":{"dur":1,"text":"When did you come to Charlotte?"},"1143":{"dur":3,"text":"So I came to Charlotte\nfrom-- actually,"},"1146":{"dur":1,"text":"my first move to\nthe United States"},"1148":{"dur":2,"text":"was to Knoxville, Tennessee, OK?"},"1151":{"dur":4,"text":"So I worked in Salvador,\nwent to production,"},"1155":{"dur":4,"text":"and then we did really a very\nnice job in that rolling mill"},"1160":{"dur":4,"text":"where we became one the best\nrolling mills in our company."},"1164":{"dur":4,"text":"And there was an\nacquisition of a group here,"},"1169":{"dur":2,"text":"in the United States,\nwith four locations."},"1172":{"dur":4,"text":"Charlotte being one of them\nand Knoxville, Tennessee,"},"1176":{"dur":3,"text":"and Jackson, Tennessee,\nand Jacksonville, Florida."},"1179":{"dur":4,"text":"And when they made that\nacquisition after that,"},"1183":{"dur":5,"text":"they asked if I was willing\nto move to the United States"},"1189":{"dur":3,"text":"not as temporary\nwork, not as two years"},"1192":{"dur":2,"text":"and then go back\nbut permanently."},"1195":{"dur":2,"text":"And I said yeah, I can do it."},"1198":{"dur":6,"text":"And I moved to Knoxville and\nspent six years in Knoxville."},"1204":{"dur":1,"text":"OK, and then came to Charlotte."},"1206":{"dur":1,"text":"And then I moved to Charlotte."},"1207":{"dur":2,"text":"So tell me about\nthe steel industry."},"1210":{"dur":4,"text":"Because I know your
