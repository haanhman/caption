enough."},"38":{"dur":1,"text":"It's really challenging in a number of ways."},"40":{"dur":7,"text":"So just to lay out the basics, it chronicles\nthe organization of two University of Chicago"},"48":{"dur":5,"text":"charter schools on the south side of Chicago,\nNorth Kenwood Oakland and Donoghue."},"53":{"dur":6,"text":"And the schools are organized ambitiously\nin two ways: one,

the\ntraditional organizations that we have sort"},"71":{"dur":1,"text":"of become used to."},"72":{"dur":5,"text":"So, can you just give us a layout of the basic\nsystems underlying these schools?"},"78":{"dur":5,"text":"Stephen: Yeah, well, the ambition for the\nkids, of course, is we're talking about kids"},"83":{"dur":7,"text":"who are African-American kids, 85% low income,\nwho historically had been behind in achievement"},"91":{"dur":2,"text":"and who..."},"93":{"dur":5,"text":"So the idea is that the school is gonna bring\nthose kids up to being equal with more middle-class"},"99":{"dur":2,"text":"kids, kids who are non-minority kids."},"102":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's a huge ambitious goal."},"104":{"dur":3,"text":"The kids are...like kids anywhere, very heterogeneous."},"108":{"dur":3,"text":"They come into school at all different levels."},"111":{"dur":4,"text":"And so this project of catching up the kids,\nwhen the kids are actually heterogeneous,"},"116":{"dur":5,"text":"this is a challenging problem for people in\nany school."},"121":{"dur":6,"text":"But also, the teachers have different levels\nof experience and skill, so they are also"},"128":{"dur":1,"text":"heterogeneous."},"129":{"dur":4,"text":"And to do this hard work of helping these\nkids catch up, the teachers have to be operating"},"134":{"dur":1,"text":"at a really high level."},"135":{"dur":5,"text":"So that means teachers have a lot to learn,\nand the teachers who know the most have to"},"141":{"dur":4,"text":"somehow be able to help the teachers who don't\nknow as much learn more so that everybody"},"145":{"dur":1,"text":"can be effective in doing this."},"147":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's a big project."},"149":{"dur":5,"text":"And part of the strategy is to keep very close\ntrack of every kid."},"155":{"dur":7,"text":"So, to know where every child is in reading\nand math, and other areas."},"162":{"dur":3,"text":"Kids are assessed every 10 weeks."},"166":{"dur":1,"text":"They're all over the place."},"167":{"dur":2,"text":"You make an instructional plan for every single\nchild."},"170":{"dur":2,"text":"Nat: For every child, not just

only at the high fliers\nand ignore the lower achieving kids."},"199":{"dur":1,"text":"Everybody's gonna move up."},"200":{"dur":2,"text":"So you're gonna test these

gonna have a new instructional plan.\""},"216":{"dur":1,"text":"Nat: Right."},"217":{"dur":5,"text":"One of the things in the book that's evident\nis how wide a web of support you create for"},"223":{"dur":1,"text":"these kids."},"224":{"dur":4,"text":"And one of the challenges that struck me,\nhow does this model work is trying to distribute"},"229":{"dur":3,"text":"the information about each kid to everybody\nthroughout."},"233":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is not just teachers on a grade level."},"236":{"dur":6,"text":"It's teachers, support professionals, the\nschool leaders, all the way down to the extended"},"242":{"dur":1,"text":"day people."},"243":{"dur":1,"text":"Stephen: That's right."},"244":{"dur":5,"text":"Nat: So how do they manage information in\nsuch a demanding network?"},"249":{"dur":6,"text":"Stephen: No, that's really a key to the whole\nthing, is to have an information system that's"},"256":{"dur":2,"text":"constantly being updated and then it's accessible\nto everybody."},"259":{"dur":6,"text":"So, a teacher can walk into the principal's\noffice and see where that teacher's children"},"265":{"dur":4,"text":"are, every single one of those kids, and where\nevery other child in the school is."},"269":{"dur":4,"text":"So a second grade teacher can see where her\nkids are and see where other second grade"},"274":{"dur":1,"text":"kids are."},"275":{"dur":4,"text":"She can see whether her kids are moving on\nthis assessment and whether other kids are"},"280":{"dur":1,"text":"moving."},"281":{"dur":3,"text":"And if kids aren't moving, there's gonna be\nsome kind of a conference to figure out how"},"285":{"dur":3,"text":"are we gonna get them to move."},"288":{"dur":5,"text":"The school brings the parents and say,

the achievement of the kids."},"314":{"dur":3,"text":"They have a plan for the social development\nof the kids."},"317":{"dur":4,"text":"It's a very demanding information system,\nand getting people to use the information"},"322":{"dur":5,"text":"and to collaborate, and to understand how\nto use that system is a whole part of what"},"328":{"dur":3,"text":"we think of as teacher expertise or social\nworker expertise."},"331":{"dur":1,"text":"It's how you use the system."},"333":{"dur":4,"text":"It's not whether you have a high SAT score\nor you went to a fancy college."},"338":{"dur":3,"text":"It's do you know how to use...can you use\nthis system in your instruction?"},"341":{"dur":1,"text":"Nat: All right."},"342":{"dur":6,"text":"You know, that points to a pretty interesting\ndeparture, at least from a lot of the literature"},"348":{"dur":4,"text":"and writings I've read on teachers in economics,\nright."},"352":{"dur":3,"text":"The idea in economics is, well, if we can\njust move the distribution of teacher quality"},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"up."},"358":{"dur":4,"text":"It's sort of like almost as if we can replace\nteachers like widgets."},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"But, this system has a very different vision."},"364":{"dur":5,"text":"It starts with distributed leadership across\nthe school, not just for the principal, but"},"370":{"dur":2,"text":"also from other teachers."},"372":{"dur":5,"text":"And then, the other component that I find\ncompelling but also a challenge is sort of"},"377":{"dur":6,"text":"an open door policy, not as an empty policy\nbut where it's normal for teachers to have"},"384":{"dur":4,"text":"other people come out and observe, give them\nfeedback and grow."},"388":{"dur":6,"text":"So, as opposed to sort of getting inputs and\nputting them in place, there's a real development"},"395":{"dur":1,"text":"process."},"396":{"dur":1,"text":"Stephen: Exactly."},"397":{"dur":1,"text":"Nat: So, just tell me how that works in school."},"399":{"dur":1,"text":"Stephen: Right."},"400":{"dur":6,"text":"So one way to say this is you have to have\na way of defining expertise, and they have"},"407":{"dur":1,"text":"to have a way of revealing it."},"408":{"dur":6,"text":"And you have to have a way of enabling the\nmore expert teachers to help the less expert"},"415":{"dur":1,"text":"teachers gain expertise."},"417":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, you've gotta start with the idea everybody's\nnot the same."},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"People come in with different backgrounds,\ndifferent experiences."},"423":{"dur":4,"text":"They've been doing this for different amounts\nof time, so it's very natural to think that"},"427":{"dur":5,"text":"people would have different levels of expertise,\nand it's a little bit uncomfortable to...for"},"432":{"dur":5,"text":"everybody to know who's really good at doing\nthis and who's not as good."},"437":{"dur":4,"text":"But if everybody has an incentive to get better,\nthen the person who needs...you know, who's"},"441":{"dur":5,"text":"a newer person, hasn't learned the system\nyet, wants to learn that system, that person's"},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"gonna wanna have an expert person helping\nthem."},"450":{"dur":4,"text":"And when a person's really good at it and\nconsistently produces good data for their"},"454":{"dur":5,"text":"children, and that person has actually learned\nhow to not only teach well, but help somebody"},"459":{"dur":4,"text":"else teach better, then that person is gonna\nbe having more responsibility and is gonna"},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"have some reward for doing that as well."},"467":{"dur":4,"text":"So there's gonna be some career advancement\nwithin teaching as you get better at doing"},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"it, and you can help other people do it."},"474":{"dur":4,"text":"You can advance in your profession without\nleaving the classroom."},"478":{"dur":1,"text":"This has been a problem in education."},"479":{"dur":4,"text":"The only way you could get ahead was to get\nout of the classroom and become an administrator."},"484":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, here...and by the way, I should say,\nif you become an administrator, you're still"},"488":{"dur":1,"text":"a part of the instructional system."},"490":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, you're a crucial part of it because\nyou are an instructional leader in that system,"},"493":{"dur":5,"text":"and it's the people who work within that system\nand thrive within that system and who've shown"},"498":{"dur":3,"text":"a track record of helping other people who\nbecome leaders in that same system and who"},"502":{"dur":3,"text":"continue to provide leadership for other teachers."},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"Nat: Right, more than managing a building\nor a set of human resources."},"509":{"dur":1,"text":"Stephen: Yeah."},"510":{"dur":4,"text":"So the idea is to have a Chief Operating Officer\nwho's gonna take care of that work and create"},"515":{"dur":4,"text":"a kind of division of labor so that the director\nof the school is mainly an instructional leader."},"520":{"dur":5,"text":"Nat: Yeah, you know, there's an...I found\na really compelling idea in the book, and"},"525":{"dur":5,"text":"I'll tell you, the book is packed with information\nso there's no way that we can cover it all."},"530":{"dur":7,"text":"One of the ideas was this idea you're using\nthe word infrastructure, the idea that in"},"537":{"dur":4,"text":"some more centralized education systems, there's\na lot more infrastructure."},"541":{"dur":5,"text":"But typically, in American public schools,\nwe have a pretty decentralized system."},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"Part of this is the view of teachers where\nthey're sort of broken off and they can close"},"551":{"dur":5,"text":"their door and do what they do in their room\nand sort of have this isolated expertise."},"556":{"dur":7,"text":"But, what informs a lot of the school model\nis infrastructure that may be hard to come"},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"by."},"565":{"dur":7,"text":"So, in your words, what do you mean by infrastructure,\nand then, who might supply it in a decentralized"},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"education system?"},"573":{"dur":3,"text":"Stephen: Right, because within a school, we\ntalked about some of the infrastructure having"},"577":{"dur":5,"text":"an assessment system, having text books, having\npeople who can coach and who can help other"},"582":{"dur":4,"text":"people get better, that's infrastructure that\nhelps a person get better."},"586":{"dur":4,"text":"But if you look between schools, you don't\nwant every school individually to have to"},"591":{"dur":3,"text":"reinvent the wheel and create a powerful instruction\nsystem."},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"If other people have learned how to do this\nand we have textbooks that work, and we have"},"598":{"dur":4,"text":"methods of assessment, we have tools that\nwork, technological tools, you were talking"},"603":{"dur":4,"text":"about having an information system, you wouldn't\nwant every school to have to invent that."},"607":{"dur":1,"text":"That would be just crazy."},"608":{"dur":3,"text":"Once you know how to do that, you wanna make\nit more widely available."},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"How is that gonna happen?"},"613":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, it could happen through a local school\ndistrict."},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"It could happen through a charter management\norganization."},"620":{"dur":4,"text":"Universities, we think, could play a much\nbigger role in partnership with schools and"},"625":{"dur":1,"text":"helping supply infrastructure."},"627":{"dur":4,"text":"Because one thing about scholars, they all\nare trying to figure out what's going on all"},"631":{"dur":3,"text":"over the place, what do we know, and what\nworks best."},"634":{"dur":4,"text":"They have...you know, presumably, we're able\nto get our hands in some evidence about that."},"639":{"dur":5,"text":"Making that accessible in a usable way through\nusable tools to people who are trying to make"},"645":{"dur":5,"text":"schools work has a lot of potential that were\nnot explained right now, we think."},"650":{"dur":3,"text":"Nat: So I don't wanna bury the lead here."},"653":{"dur":1,"text":"You've got some results."},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"Can you just give us a thumbnail on, first\nof all, how you know what you know about the"},"659":{"dur":4,"text":"outcomes of these students, and give us some\nperspective on how big they are."},"663":{"dur":1,"text":"Stephen: Right, yeah, sure."},"664":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, the reason we know is we're very fortunate\nthat every year in each of the schools in"},"669":{"dur":4,"text":"each grade, people come and apply for the\nschool, and there are more people applying"},"674":{"dur":1,"text":"than there are seats."},"675":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, admission to school is decided by\na randomized lottery."},"680":{"dur":5,"text":"So what that means is that we have, for these\nschools, we have statistically equivalent"},"685":{"dur":4,"text":"group of kids who win the lottery and therefore\ngo to the school and another group of kids"},"690":{"dur":3,"text":"who lose the lottery and therefore, don't\ngo to the school."},"693":{"dur":7,"text":"So that means that we can make fair, objective\ncomparisons of these two groups and make a"},"700":{"dur":4,"text":"determination of what is the impact of the\nschool that's free of the usual biases that"},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"we see when we just look at achievement between\ntwo different schools."},"707":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's a randomization, randomized lottery."},"709":{"dur":5,"text":"It's kind of we call it in social science\nthe gold standard for causal inference, okay?"},"715":{"dur":4,"text":"To try to really make these results plain,\nlet's think about two distributions."},"719":{"dur":4,"text":"There's a distribution of test scores for\nall the white kids in Chicago and there's"},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"a distribution of test scores for the black\nkids in Chicago."},"727":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay, let's take the white kids."},"729":{"dur":3,"text":"If I'm at the 50th percentile of the white\ndistribution, I'm a white kid in Chicago,"},"732":{"dur":3,"text":"that means that I'm scoring below half the\nkids but above half the kids."},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm right in the middle of the distribution,\nokay?"},"739":{"dur":5,"text":"And same thing, if I'm a black kid, I may\nbe in the middle of black distribution."},"744":{"dur":5,"text":"So the question is, how do those two distributions\ncompare if kids lose the lottery and, as a"},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"result, are not able to go to the charter\nschool, okay?"},"753":{"dur":4,"text":"And what we know is that the kid who's in\nthe middle of the black distribution is gonna"},"758":{"dur":4,"text":"be at the 26th percentile of the white distribution,\nokay?"},"762":{"dur":7,"text":"So that means that the typical black kid is\ngonna be outscored by 74% of the white kids,"},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"okay?"},"770":{"dur":3,"text":"What we'd like to see is we'd like to see\nthe black distribution move up and become"},"774":{"dur":1,"text":"the same as the white distribution."},"775":{"dur":4,"text":"If it were, that would mean that the child\nin the middle of the black distribution would"},"780":{"dur":5,"text":"be right in the middle of the white distribution,\n50-50, be at the 50 percentile of white distribution."},"785":{"dur":8,"text":"What we see is that, as a result of winning\nthe lottery and attending the charter school,"},"794":{"dur":5,"text":"that the black distribution moves up from\nthe 26th percentile of the white distribution"},"799":{"dur":1,"text":"up to the 44th."},"801":{"dur":5,"text":"So the typical kid who wins the lottery and\nattends the school is gonna be at the 44th"},"806":{"dur":1,"text":"percentile of the white distribution."},"807":{"dur":7,"text":"We want it to be 50 and we're not there, but\nwe have moved a long way from 26 up to 44."},"815":{"dur":1,"text":"Nat: Far more than half the achievement."},"817":{"dur":3,"text":"Stephen: Far more than half the achievement."},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"And I wanna say one other thing."},"822":{"dur":3,"text":"When these kids leave the elementary schools,\nthis is where we're really surprised to see"},"826":{"dur":1,"text":"this."},"827":{"dur":3,"text":"A lot of social science research would have\npredicted that those effects would fade out..."},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"Nat: Fade out, yeah."},"831":{"dur":1,"text":"Stephen: ...when they go to secondary school\nbecause they are no longer under the care"},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"of this particular school, which is quite\nunusual."},"836":{"dur":1,"text":"But what we see is quite the contrast."},"837":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, the effects increase."},"841":{"dur":2,"text":"So these are not effects that fade out."},"843":{"dur":4,"text":"These are effects that grow as kids move into\na secondary school."},"847":{"dur":1,"text":"Nat: You know, that's fantastic."},"849":{"dur":5,"text":"So I sort of approached a lot of my studies\nfrom the economic lens, which, you know, we"},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"talked about the benefits and we talked a\nminute about the cost."},"858":{"dur":4,"text":"I know it may not be easy but there's sort\nof three things to talk about."},"863":{"dur":5,"text":"One is just the funding, but beyond that,\nit seems like you had two elements that also"},"868":{"dur":1,"text":"helped the University of Chicago schools."},"870":{"dur":3,"text":"One is the University of Chicago, which sort\nof drew expertise."},"874":{"dur":6,"text":"That would be expensive and is perhaps hard\nto estimate but still important."},"880":{"dur":3,"text":"And then there's also some other in kind resources\nthat it seemed to get that weren't from the"},"884":{"dur":3,"text":"university, that were, you know, from the\ncommunity and so forth."},"887":{"dur":3,"text":"So can you just give us a thumbnail also on\nthe resource side?"},"891":{"dur":1,"text":"Stephen: Sure."},"892":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, very basically, these are Chicago public\nschools."},"897":{"dur":6,"text":"And although they are formally charter schools,\nthey are funded with regular per pupil expenditures"},"904":{"dur":2,"text":"for the Chicago public schools."},"906":{"dur":6,"text":"And so, if you know about Chicago public schools,\nthe funding is not high compared to a lot"},"912":{"dur":4,"text":"of other urban districts: New York, D.C.,\nBoston, many other urban districts."},"917":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's a pretty low funded district."},"921":{"dur":9,"text":"And so, we do...to make this model work, we\ntry to raise some extra money, about $2,000"},"930":{"dur":6,"text":"per pupil that would bring...but that would\nbring the cost of educating these kids up"},"937":{"dur":6,"text":"to where actually still below where a lot\nof urban schools are but a little bit closer."},"943":{"dur":6,"text":"So it's not an...just in terms of outright\nexpenditures, it's not an overly expensive"},"950":{"dur":2,"text":"model by any stretch of the imagination."},"952":{"dur":5,"text":"But as you pointed out, and this is an excellent\npoint, there are hard to measure advantages"},"958":{"dur":5,"text":"that the school gains by working closely with\nthe university, where the university is...we"},"964":{"dur":4,"text":"have something called the Urban Education\nInstitute of the University of Chicago, is"},"968":{"dur":3,"text":"actually operating almost as a small district."},"972":{"dur":4,"text":"I didn't mention, we actually have four charter\nschools because we have a high school and"},"976":{"dur":2,"text":"another middle school, as well as these two\nelementaries."},"978":{"dur":5,"text":"And the Urban Education Institute does other\nthings and it has very good practitioners,"},"984":{"dur":2,"text":"as well as researchers."},"986":{"dur":8,"text":"So, that benefit of being able to work closely\nwith the University of Chicago and helping"},"995":{"dur":7,"text":"develop some new assessments, some new tools,\nsome new coaching methods, and using research"},"1002":{"dur":5,"text":"the...we have access to other universities\nthat do a really good job with reading instruction."},"1007":{"dur":2,"text":"They've done research and we've used those\nthings."},"1009":{"dur":2,"text":"So we make those things available."},"1012":{"dur":5,"text":"So that's the thing that we do that maybe\na lot of other...talk about infrastructure,"},"1017":{"dur":4,"text":"a lot of other districts might not be doing\nor some other organizations."},"1021":{"dur":6,"text":"But we think that other institutions, like\nI say, charter school management systems or"},"1027":{"dur":2,"text":"districts could do more of that."},"1029":{"dur":5,"text":"And we also think there's a much bigger role\nfor universities to play and making partnerships,"},"1035":{"dur":6,"text":"and helping generate the know-how for excellent\nschooling."},"1041":{"dur":2,"text":"And I wanna say one other thing."},"1043":{"dur":6,"text":"What we find when we work with...at the university,\nwe work with teachers, we find wonderful people,"},"1049":{"dur":6,"text":"exemplary people, teachers who have incredible\nideas, we can help those people get their"},"1055":{"dur":1,"text":"ideas out."},"1056":{"dur":5,"text":"A lot of what you see in the book are actually\nquotes from just fantastic leaders in schools."},"1062":{"dur":5,"text":"So by getting their word out, practitioners\naren't paid to tell the world what they know,"},"1068":{"dur":1,"text":"they just do it."},"1070":{"dur":5,"text":"So universities can help make accessible to\na broader range of people what great practitioners"},"1075":{"dur":3,"text":"know, and we think that's another thing that\nuniversities can do much more of."},"1079":{"dur":4,"text":"Nat: Well, perhaps a lot of universities that\nfocus on teacher training can export a little"},"1083":{"dur":5,"text":"teacher training to the schools and can provide\na little infrastructure in return, so that's..."},"1088":{"dur":3,"text":"Stephen: Yeah, I think we have to take a hard\nlook at how we do teacher training and how"},"1092":{"dur":3,"text":"we learn from the teacher training that we're\ndoing."},"1095":{"dur":3,"text":"I think we can do a lot better with that,\ntakes it kind of in a different direction"},"1099":{"dur":1,"text":"but..."},"1100":{"dur":5,"text":"Because just having the experience we've seen,\nwhere we take these kids who would have perhaps"},"1105":{"dur":4,"text":"really
