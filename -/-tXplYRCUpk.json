2012."},"1106":{"dur":2,"text":"This year we lost only four wolves."},"1108":{"dur":1,"text":"Last year we lost none."},"1110":{"dur":2,"text":"So the number of wolves\ntaken is highly variable,"},"1112":{"dur":2,"text":"and generally below 3%."},"1115":{"dur":3,"text":"Except that year in 2012\nwhere it reached 12%,"},"1118":{"dur":2,"text":"and it probably did, even at that

is,"},"1128":{"dur":1,"text":"the park service mission is"},"1130":{"dur":2,"text":"to manage for a natural population."},"1132":{"dur":2,"text":"Wolves are very social animals,"},"1135":{"dur":3,"text":"so they have a social\nnetwork that's important"},"1138":{"dur":2,"text":"to how they function\nas a pack or a family."},"1141":{"dur":2,"text":"And we don't have as much information"},"1144":{"dur":2,"text":"on that social functioning as we do"},"1146":{"dur":2,"text":"about their population numbers."},"1148":{"dur":3,"text":"And we know that there\nis a harvestable surplus"},"1151":{"dur":1,"text":"in terms of numbers,"},"1153":{"dur":3,"text":"and that has not been exceeded\nso far for Yellowstone."},"1157":{"dur":1,"text":"But there are some questions"},"1158":{"dur":3,"text":"if you remove a key wolf in the pack."},"1162":{"dur":3,"text":"A high ranking individual, so to speak."},"1165":{"dur":2,"text":"What's the impact on that pack?"},"1168":{"dur":3,"text":"Or a second ranking individual."},"1172":{"dur":2,"text":"What does that do to pack dynamics?"},"1174":{"dur":2,"text":"In one case, it caused\nthe pack to split apart."},"1177":{"dur":2,"text":"Was that because that\nhigh ranking individual"},"1179":{"dur":3,"text":"was removed or would that\npack have split up naturally?"},"1183":{"dur":0,"text":"Those are important questions"},"1184":{"dur":1,"text":"for the park service to wrestle with."},"1186":{"dur":3,"text":"Because even though it doesn't\naffect the numbers of wolves,"},"1190":{"dur":3,"text":"it affects how wolves\nlive on the landscape"},"1193":{"dur":1,"text":"and function to themselves."},"1195":{"dur":4,"text":"And places like Yellowstone\nhold this dearly,"},"1199":{"dur":4,"text":"because most wolves across North America"},"1203":{"dur":1,"text":"are impacted by people."},"1205":{"dur":4,"text":"And most biologists would\nargue at a sustainable level."},"1210":{"dur":2,"text":"We still have lots of\nwolves across North America,"},"1213":{"dur":5,"text":"but we really don't know\ncertain aspects about wolf life."},"1218":{"dur":4,"text":"And this social aspect is the\none we know the least about."},"1222":{"dur":2,"text":"So if we're going to be\nmanagers of Yellowstone"},"1225":{"dur":3,"text":"that pursue these ideals of naturalness,"},"1229":{"dur":3,"text":"I think it's important\nto include all aspects."},"1232":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, which wolves get\nremoved, and how that impacts"},"1237":{"dur":3,"text":"the pack and the\npopulation, and importantly"},"1241":{"dur":2,"text":"the packs' relationship to each other,"},"1244":{"dur":2,"text":"because they're always\ncompeting against each other,"},"1246":{"dur":2,"text":"and if one pack loses\nsome key individuals,"},"1249":{"dur":3,"text":"we know that the\nindividual makeup of packs"},"1252":{"dur":2,"text":"affects how they compete with each other."},"1255":{"dur":1,"text":"It also affects how they prey on elk."},"1257":{"dur":3,"text":"We know big males are important\nto helping take down elk."},"1261":{"dur":2,"text":"So those are questions\nwe're wrestling with."},"1263":{"dur":2,"text":"So to say removing wolf has no impact"},"1266":{"dur":2,"text":"on the wolf population, you\nhave to qualify what you mean."},"1269":{"dur":2,"text":"Are you talking numeric,\nor are you talking social?"},"1271":{"dur":3,"text":"And we're still looking for those answers."},"1280":{"dur":3,"text":"Wolves are one of the most\nstudied species in the world."},"1283":{"dur":2,"text":"Beginning in the late 1950's they weren't,"},"1286":{"dur":2,"text":"and because of the problems\nthat are associated"},"1288":{"dur":2,"text":"living with wolves,"},"1290":{"dur":3,"text":"a lot of studies were kicked\noff in the 50's and 60's,"},"1293":{"dur":1,"text":"and now they're one of the most studied"},"1295":{"dur":1,"text":"animals on the planet."},"1297":{"dur":2,"text":"And so it's hard to advance your knowledge"},"1299":{"dur":1,"text":"in that kind of arena."},"1301":{"dur":2,"text":"But Yellowstone has."},"1303":{"dur":1,"text":"There was a book published in 2003"},"1305":{"dur":2,"text":"which was a review of all the science done"},"1307":{"dur":2,"text":"on wolves up to that point,"},"1309":{"dur":2,"text":"and in the introduction of that book"},"1312":{"dur":2,"text":"the author said, \"We've tried to include"},"1315":{"dur":2,"text":"\"as much knowledge as\nYellowstone has learned"},"1317":{"dur":2,"text":"\"in the first few years, but Yellowstone"},"1320":{"dur":2,"text":"\"holds the most promise to unlocking"},"1322":{"dur":3,"text":"\"some of the wolves secrets\nthat are so far unknown.\""},"1326":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think Yellowstone has done that,"},"1328":{"dur":3,"text":"and that's because, and this\nis somewhat controversial,"},"1332":{"dur":3,"text":"we've had a good radio collaring record."},"1335":{"dur":3,"text":"So we're able to follow\nindividuals in packs."},"1339":{"dur":2,"text":"The park is big, but it's more accessible,"},"1342":{"dur":2,"text":"than say northern Canada or Alaska."},"1345":{"dur":4,"text":"And about half our population\nis viewed daily from the road."},"1349":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is an odd feature of recovery"},"1351":{"dur":1,"text":"that I didn't think would occur."},"1352":{"dur":2,"text":"I thought wolves would be\nmore secretive and shy,"},"1355":{"dur":4,"text":"but we're getting information\nabout pack dynamics,"},"1360":{"dur":2,"text":"about individuals, about predation,"},"1362":{"dur":3,"text":"about interactions with other\nspecies, on a daily basis."},"1366":{"dur":4,"text":"And there's no other study in\nthe world that's doing that."},"1370":{"dur":2,"text":"And then we do the traditional things."},"1373":{"dur":3,"text":"Radio tracking, airplanes,\ngenetics, drawing blood,"},"1376":{"dur":3,"text":"looking at disease exposure,\nthat all the other studies do."},"1380":{"dur":3,"text":"So you combine the\ntraditional scientific methods"},"1383":{"dur":4,"text":"with citizen science and daily observation"},"1387":{"dur":5,"text":"and a public that loves

immeasurably important"},"1407":{"dur":4,"text":"to the park's goals and policies."},"1411":{"dur":2,"text":"That people see intact nature."},"1414":{"dur":5,"text":"So yeah, Yellowstone has

wolves,"},"1425":{"dur":2,"text":"because to be honest,\nthere is a lot of negative,"},"1428":{"dur":1,"text":"because they're hard to live with,"},"1430":{"dur":2,"text":"but having Yellowstone there,"},"1432":{"dur":2,"text":"providing this positive, good news,"},"1434":{"dur":2,"text":"has been very important, and\nnot only for Yellowstone,"},"1437":{"dur":2,"text":"but what we know about
