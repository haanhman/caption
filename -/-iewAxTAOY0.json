well."},"792":{"dur":4,"text":"So for example, the highest completion rates are in the mechanical engineering trades"},"797":{"dur":4,"text":"and the lowest are in building and engineering technicians

two-thirds"},"808":{"dur":5,"text":"whereas the jurisdiction we're in right now, the ACT, had the lowest at 53.4 per cent."},"814":{"dur":4,"text":"So there's a whole range of factors that could

are the more significant drivers of an individual apprentice's completion rate."},"840":{"dur":8,"text":"Just to note that the analysis here"},"848":{"dur":4,"text":"and the fact that the analysis was on what we call individual completion rates,"},"852":{"dur":5,"text":"so in terms of the completion rate is there are two steps in how that's calculated."},"858":{"dur":2,"text":"The first step is what they call the contract completion,"},"861":{"dur":3,"text":"so when an apprentice starts with an employer"},"864":{"dur":4,"text":"there's a contract between the apprentice and the employer for that apprenticeship."},"868":{"dur":3,"text":"But it's not uncommon for an apprentice to move from one employer to another,"},"872":{"dur":5,"text":"so there's a break in the contract, so that was the contract completion rate."},"878":{"dur":4,"text":"But then the NCVER looks at contract completion rates"},"882":{"dur":2,"text":"and then looks at what's the recommencement rate of the apprentices,"},"885":{"dur":5,"text":"so that they know from the data they get if an apprentice starts a new apprenticeship, so that's a recommencement."},"891":{"dur":4,"text":"So from that analysis data let's say, start with a contract completion,"},"896":{"dur":4,"text":"add a recommencement rate to get what they call the individual completion rate,"},"900":{"dur":3,"text":"which is trying to focus on what's the overall completion rate of an apprentice"},"903":{"dur":7,"text":"who finishes their apprenticeship full stop, as opposed to looking purely at contract completions."},"911":{"dur":7,"text":"If you're looking at contract completions, you'd get a lower estimate compared to the individual completions."},"919":{"dur":3,"text":"If you've got questions about that, it's a bit technical, ask at the end"},"922":{"dur":6,"text":"but in the report we try quite hard to give a good explanation about that."},"928":{"dur":6,"text":"In terms of reasons for non-completion, we're able to draw the NCVER model,"},"934":{"dur":7,"text":"draw from their apprentice and training destination survey to look at this question for 2010 data set."},"942":{"dur":3,"text":"They tried - let's just start looking as well at the 2008 survey"},"946":{"dur":4,"text":"but the number of engineering trades were quite small in that."},"950":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's a whole range of questions which the survey asks"},"953":{"dur":6,"text":"about why former apprentices do not complete their apprenticeship."},"960":{"dur":5,"text":"The most significant one for the engineering trades, and similarly for all trades as well,"},"965":{"dur":4,"text":"was having lost their job or being made redundant by the employer,"},"970":{"dur":5,"text":"so it wasn't through their own choice, it was more imposed upon them by an employer;"},"975":{"dur":7,"text":"doing something different or better is significant; personal reasons; so there's a whole range of factors."},"983":{"dur":4,"text":"One area that got a bit of debate right near the end of finalising our report"},"988":{"dur":3,"text":"was about the role of wages in the apprentice non-completion."},"992":{"dur":5,"text":"That's only one of several factors that were examined under the doing something better different categories."},"998":{"dur":5,"text":"So as you can see here it's half the reasons compared to the people who lost their job."},"1003":{"dur":3,"text":"Question: Sorry, can I just interrupt."},"1007":{"dur":5,"text":"Does the wages come under doing something better or different or poor working conditions?"},"1012":{"dur":3,"text":"Andrew: The second one, doing something better;"},"1016":{"dur":2,"text":"in terms of getting better, moving to a different job for more money."},"1019":{"dur":9,"text":"I think from memory there are three specific sub-questions within that category analysed."},"1029":{"dur":7,"text":"As we say in the report, and you see, it's difficult to draw firm conclusions"},"1037":{"dur":3,"text":"in terms of the role of wages per se but we think, generally speaking,"},"1040":{"dur":6,"text":"it's more a factor influencing commencements in the first place."},"1047":{"dur":3,"text":"So if someone's going to be turned off by an apprenticeship wage"},"1050":{"dur":7,"text":"they might not commence in the first place, as opposed to falling out halfway through."},"1057":{"dur":5,"text":"It's pretty clearly publicised what the wages are and so forth,"},"1063":{"dur":4,"text":"so that's an area that there is a bit of debate about that issue."},"1068":{"dur":5,"text":"Peter: That probably, I know we said we would talk to you about it,"},"1073":{"dur":8,"text":"to make one point which is that probably as apprentices get older apprentices who are work wage with the -"},"1082":{"dur":3,"text":"they've got family commitments that they were taking on,"},"1086":{"dur":6,"text":"probably going to be more of an impact because they might not have been aware"},"1093":{"dur":5,"text":"of what their personal circumstances were going to be compared say to a young person."},"1099":{"dur":11,"text":"So we'll just take that with a grain of salt, the relevance of the age and the family and personal circumstances."},"1111":{"dur":6,"text":"Andrew: One area where the engineering trades' reasons were significantly different to all trades was the very top one,"},"1118":{"dur":2,"text":"the lost job or being made redundant,"},"1120":{"dur":6,"text":"so all the other ones they're not statistically significantly different to the all trades estimate."},"1127":{"dur":6,"text":"In the lost job or made redundant, I guess that result -"},"1134":{"dur":3,"text":"I just realised this then actually - could have been influenced heavily"},"1137":{"dur":3,"text":"by that big dip in the 2009 commencements."},"1140":{"dur":6,"text":"For example, for apprentices who were let go, for example, that could be a major factor then."},"1146":{"dur":6,"text":"So I suspect a more recent version of the survey that hasn't taken place yet, could have a different number again."},"1153":{"dur":8,"text":"Just in terms of the time it takes for apprentices to -"},"1161":{"dur":3,"text":"those that don't complete, how long does that take?"},"1165":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is using the contract data, so the contracts between employers and apprentices,"},"1169":{"dur":3,"text":"looking at the contract attrition rate."},"1172":{"dur":6,"text":"So it's saying, and this is comparing all engineering trades with the all trades, it's far more common -"},"1178":{"dur":5,"text":"I guess the first thing is, in the first two years that's when the bulk of the non-completions occur."},"1184":{"dur":4,"text":"So for the engineering trades, in terms of the non-completion of contracts,"},"1189":{"dur":7,"text":"looking at about 38 per cent within two years and about 44 per cent within two years for the all trades."},"1197":{"dur":7,"text":"After five years it only raises up for engineering trades, from the 38 per cent up to about 45 per cent."},"1204":{"dur":6,"text":"So the vast majority of the non-completions of these contracts are in the first two years."},"1210":{"dur":6,"text":"That suggests that, yeah that's when the focus of any intervention and so forth would need to be"},"1216":{"dur":4,"text":"and that eventuates to also what is currently happening in this space."},"1221":{"dur":5,"text":"So there are certain jurisdictions have programs and so forth which are focussed more at the first six months,"},"1226":{"dur":9,"text":"first one year period, in terms of trying to improve completion rates."},"1235":{"dur":5,"text":"So in terms of just bringing together, I guess, what we've found from the data analysis,"},"1241":{"dur":4,"text":"in terms of the survey analysis, the literature review but also the consultations,"},"1246":{"dur":8,"text":"because we spoke with a wide range of employers, RTOs, GTOs, state government departments."},"1254":{"dur":6,"text":"We also spoke to a wide range of apprentice non-completers as well,"},"1261":{"dur":4,"text":"just to get their perspective on the issue, but also some completers as well,"},"1265":{"dur":5,"text":"so getting a wide range of views about factors influencing completion and non-completion,"},"1271":{"dur":2,"text":"so we spoke to a wide range of people."},"1273":{"dur":4,"text":"I should say that it was a bit difficult to get hold of the non-completers"},"1277":{"dur":5,"text":"but with some help from some of the state training authorities helped to get to speak to some of them."},"1283":{"dur":7,"text":"So in terms of just bringing together what the overarching factors that we feel identify as being major factors,"},"1291":{"dur":7,"text":"so we've grouped these into a chronological approach, starting with the before and during apprenticeship."},"1298":{"dur":6,"text":"So the before factors we think are pretty important, in terms of the apprentice characteristics,"},"1304":{"dur":3,"text":"so looking at the degree of aptitude that the apprentice has for the engineering trade,"},"1308":{"dur":6,"text":"so there's a question mark about trying to improve knowledge and aptitude for engineering trades."},"1314":{"dur":7,"text":"Educational attainment is a significant factor, so whilst it's not that high in maths for example,"},"1321":{"dur":3,"text":"in terms of the engineering trades it is a requirement for at least a reasonable degree"},"1325":{"dur":4,"text":"a mathematical skill in running these big lathes and so forth"},"1329":{"dur":4,"text":"and programming them so that they're reasonably complicated."},"1334":{"dur":7,"text":"Another important factor is the recruitment processes undertaken by employers to attain apprentices"},"1342":{"dur":7,"text":"and particularly how do they filter and assess potential apprentices as well."},"1349":{"dur":3,"text":"So they're the before apprenticeship factors and during apprenticeship"},"1353":{"dur":5,"text":"there's a whole range of factors that cut across the three or four years but more focussed,"},"1358":{"dur":2,"text":"we think, in the first couple of years."},"1360":{"dur":4,"text":"So there are workplace characteristics and support practice;"},"1364":{"dur":3,"text":"the degree of formal support provided by employers to apprentices,"},"1368":{"dur":2,"text":"but not just employers, by the GTOs or RTOs as well,"},"1370":{"dur":5,"text":"so there's a range of entities involved in providing support to the apprentices;"},"1376":{"dur":2,"text":"how the employer approaches apprentice training"},"1378":{"dur":6,"text":"in terms of providing the ongoing mentoring and training role within the work place;"},"1384":{"dur":2,"text":"also just the support mechanisms available to employers"},"1387":{"dur":7,"text":"in terms of supporting them undertaking their role as a mentor and a trainer of apprentices."},"1395":{"dur":6,"text":"In terms of formal training, so that's as undertaken by particularly RTOs,"},"1402":{"dur":3,"text":"it's the off the job training requirement"},"1405":{"dur":5,"text":"and making sure that it aligns with both the employer and the apprentice needs."},"1411":{"dur":8,"text":"There was a fair bit of discussion about how well does that off the job training align with support"},"1419":{"dur":1,"text":"with what's happening on the job as well,"},"1421":{"dur":5,"text":"so there's a an issue about how well they're aligned, working together."},"1426":{"dur":3,"text":"Finally the issue about the apprentice remuneration,"},"1430":{"dur":3,"text":"wage progression over the course of the apprenticeship is seen as being reasonably important"},"1434":{"dur":3,"text":"in terms of there being a recognition as

also a factor about just improving awareness"},"1449":{"dur":2,"text":"about what are the wage prospects following the apprenticeship."},"1452":{"dur":4,"text":"So it does seem that, for at least some of the non-completers,"},"1456":{"dur":3,"text":"there's a lack of awareness or realisation about what is the expectation"},"1460":{"dur":3,"text":"about wage growth and so forth once they do finish

structural factors in the economy,"},"1556":{"dur":7,"text":"the slowdown in mining, I think will probably have another impact on those commencement numbers"},"1564":{"dur":8,"text":"and possibly, for some employers, their long term commitment to being able to sustain the apprenticeship."},"1572":{"dur":7,"text":"I mean we'll see, but I just have a feeling that that's all going to be part of the shake up around manufacturing industry"},"1579":{"dur":2,"text":"and also the slowdown in mining."},"1582":{"dur":7,"text":"What we tried to do in looking at the strategies was to really focus on this framework, I suppose,"},"1589":{"dur":6,"text":"which is to look at the important points of intervention across the years and the life span of the apprenticeship."},"1595":{"dur":4,"text":"The first one is directed - there are a series of strategies which are essentially about,"},"1600":{"dur":3,"text":"what you might call, the apprentice characteristics."},"1603":{"dur":4,"text":"Now what's not so strongly in the report but came through pretty strongly in consultations"},"1607":{"dur":4,"text":"is also the question of literacy, numeracy, aptitude"},"1611":{"dur":6,"text":"and the general preparation of apprentices for entry to these skilled trades."},"1618":{"dur":7,"text":"It's a matter of conjecture whether - and we canvassed it in the report -"},"1625":{"dur":6,"text":"standards are falling or whether brighter kids, who might have gone into an apprenticeship in previous decades"},"1631":{"dur":6,"text":"are possibly going to university and therefore employers aren't recruiting from the cream;"},"1637":{"dur":5,"text":"that's an area I think it'd be worth studying."},"1643":{"dur":10,"text":"But what's unique about the engineering trades is that there's a bit of a coming together of a lack of preparation,"},"1653":{"dur":8,"text":"both in terms of literacy and numeracy, but also skills and aptitudes and understanding of what these careers are."},"1661":{"dur":5,"text":"So if you look at other trades, if somebody says carpenter, brick layer, auto mechanic,"},"1666":{"dur":3,"text":"they've got a pretty clear idea what the occupation is."},"1670":{"dur":4,"text":"Engineering can of course mean - I mean universities teach engineering"},"1675":{"dur":5,"text":"or we're still talking about boilermakers and who's a machinist and all those things,"},"1680":{"dur":4,"text":"and of course there's a lot of industrial resistance to changing these terms and changing these classification,"},"1685":{"dur":2,"text":"but almost unanimously people were saying,"},"1688":{"dur":4,"text":"these terms are either not understood or convey completely the wrong meaning."},"1693":{"dur":4,"text":"So if you say to a young person, do you want to become a boilermaker,"},"1697":{"dur":2,"text":"well no, who would want to be a boilermaker today,"},"1699":{"dur":4,"text":"but in fact if you look at the range of skills that are involved in the traditional trade of boilermaking"},"1704":{"dur":6,"text":"there's a whole lot of really interesting skill and quite high paying jobs that fall under that."},"1711":{"dur":3,"text":"So for engineering, and this finding is very specific to engineering,"},"1715":{"dur":5,"text":"there certainly needs to be an improved understanding of the range of jobs and skills and occupational outcomes."},"1721":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think for the skills council, for the department, for AWPA and so on,"},"1724":{"dur":7,"text":"there is something about engineering that needs to be pursued."},"1731":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's distribution of high quality materials and so on"},"1734":{"dur":4,"text":"but also if you look at the VET in Schools numbers for these courses"},"1739":{"dur":5,"text":"they're pretty low and a lot of kids doing VET in Schools courses aren't getting proper exposure to,"},"1744":{"dur":4,"text":"particularly the better workplaces that might make them interested in the career."},"1749":{"dur":6,"text":"So a lot of apprentices seem to fall de facto into these jobs in an incidental way,"},"1755":{"dur":3,"text":"rather than a planned and structured way."},"1760":{"dur":2,"text":"Similarly, in terms of support,"},"1762":{"dur":8,"text":"what we found was that there's a very big difference between the employers who are bigger and larger,"},"1771":{"dur":5,"text":"have good HR departments and have a long standing and high quality engagement with the apprenticeship system,"},"1776":{"dur":3,"text":"with state training authorities, with the Australian Apprenticeship Centres and so on."},"1780":{"dur":6,"text":"In other words they really know the system, know how to work it, know how to present and package material."},"1786":{"dur":3,"text":"We spoke to one terrific firm out in Melbourne"},"1790":{"dur":6,"text":"where the retired founder of the firm still comes to the apprentice intake barbecue on a Sunday with all of the families"},"1797":{"dur":5,"text":"and still gives a speech of welcome and meets all the mums and dads."},"1802":{"dur":3,"text":"So the whole thing is a real commitment from the company to say,"},"1805":{"dur":4,"text":"you are the new recruits, you are the future of the company and so on."},"1810":{"dur":5,"text":"Compare that to other examples where, maybe in a small company,"},"1816":{"dur":9,"text":"the apprentice kind of stumbles in by accident and the employer's not really clear what's involved et cetera,"},"1825":{"dur":4,"text":"so the whole thing kind of diverges at that point."},"1829":{"dur":7,"text":"So the support and and guidance for employers around HR practices,"},"1836":{"dur":5,"text":"and Australian Industry Group is doing this, as is the Victorian Chamber of -"},"1842":{"dur":10,"text":"whatever they are - the Automotive Chamber in Victoria are also trying to provide a lot more structured support for their employer members."},"1853":{"dur":2,"text":"But both employer organisations will concede the problem"},"1856":{"dur":4,"text":"is the people who tend to come to those workshops and participate are the better employers anyway,"},"1860":{"dur":5,"text":"so they're still not getting to the employers who probably need the most support."},"1866":{"dur":7,"text":"Still also a lot of complaints from employers about complexity, paperwork, confusion and so on."},"1874":{"dur":4,"text":"Probably the main thing we would really emphasise though,"},"1878":{"dur":4,"text":"is this question of matching employers and apprentices so that -"},"1883":{"dur":9,"text":"I'll be frank here, at the moment, I think our judgement would be that neither the Australian Apprenticeship Centres,"},"1892":{"dur":5,"text":"nor the state apprenticeship bodies are providing the kind of role"},"1898":{"dur":3,"text":"that we probably had in mind when the system was first designed."},"1901":{"dur":3,"text":"Where, with the signing of the training agreement and that whole process,"},"1905":{"dur":6,"text":"it's meant to go on to match employers and apprentices and get a training agreement"},"1911":{"dur":8,"text":"and make sure that they're choosing wisely and people know what they're getting into."},"1920":{"dur":5,"text":"The impression is that the Australian Apprenticeship Centres are largely transactional in nature,"},"1926":{"dur":4,"text":"dealing mainly with administrative side of things and pushing people through."},"1930":{"dur":3,"text":"The state training authorities these days have become -"},"1933":{"dur":5,"text":"the role in this area is largely residual, so they're receiving and processing training agreements"},"1938":{"dur":4,"text":"but there's not the same support and advice and assistance"},"1943":{"dur":4,"text":"to make sure that the matching process is really working for employers and apprentices who need it."},"1948":{"dur":5,"text":"When you think about, given our other findings around the importance of the workplace experience"},"1954":{"dur":7,"text":"and the fact that that seems to contribute most to low completions or to people falling out,"},"1962":{"dur":4,"text":"we would really emphasise the importance of better matching."},"1966":{"dur":8,"text":"That includes support and guidance for employers in recruitment and selection strategies."},"1975":{"dur":10,"text":"As I said, better information about the engineering trades to increase the pool of quality applicants."},"1985":{"dur":3,"text":"That basically means updated information and job roles"},"1989":{"dur":5,"text":"and the range of work and engagement with students, parents, career advisor's et cetera,"},"1995":{"dur":5,"text":"to try and get a better pool of well-informed apprentices with strong vocational interests who are most likely to complete."},"2001":{"dur":5,"text":"What we found in talking to the apprentices was that the ones who knew exactly what they were coming into,"},"2007":{"dur":6,"text":"had a real interest in the trade - possibly because their father or an uncle or family friend was in the trade"},"2013":{"dur":5,"text":"and they knew exactly what the trade was about and were therefore motivated -"},"2019":{"dur":2,"text":"were most likely to complete."},"2021":{"dur":3,"text":"So what we're talking about doing here is actually trying to, if you like,"},"2025":{"dur":4,"text":"build up a bigger pool of potential applicants from whom employers could choose."},"2030":{"dur":2,"text":"Because again, the good employers we chose from,"},"2033":{"dur":4,"text":"the place I mentioned out in Melbourne, WD Adams, they get I think,"},"2037":{"dur":5,"text":"I can't remember the exact numbers, but it's something like 15 apprentices"},"2042":{"dur":2,"text":"and they're choosing from over 100."},"2045":{"dur":2,"text":"So they're actually able to draw from a very wide range of pools,"},"2048":{"dur":3,"text":"compared to other employers we spoke to who are basically saying,"},"2051":{"dur":2,"text":"well we kind of take what we can get."},"2053":{"dur":5,"text":"So the variation between that organisation and others was significant."},"2058":{"dur":5,"text":"We do see an important role to re-think the role of the Australian Apprenticeship Centres,"},"2064":{"dur":7,"text":"to have a more active role in assisting employers, rather than just being transactional."},"2072":{"dur":2,"text":"I've spoken about the advisory services,"},"2074":{"dur":6,"text":"what we also found was that the Australian Apprenticeship Mentoring Program that was established"},"2081":{"dur":6,"text":"I think two or three years ago, of all the programs that were mentioned -"},"2088":{"dur":4,"text":"and we found the same thing by the way in the Building Australia's Future Workforce study -"},"2093":{"dur":3,"text":"the mentoring one gets a really big tick."},"2096":{"dur":4,"text":"That's both from the point of the view of the organisations who are running it,"},"2100":{"dur":4,"text":"from RTOs and group schemes but also from the individual employers."},"2105":{"dur":3,"text":"What it means is that, the way the mentors work,"},"2108":{"dur":6,"text":"it basically means that a lot of the sharp edges that can occur"},"2114":{"dur":4,"text":"when the relationship between an apprentice and employer starts to deteriorate,"},"2119":{"dur":4,"text":"a lot of the mentors are older, they're experienced, they've been through it"},"2124":{"dur":5,"text":"and they can come in and be a bit of a neutral party to help resolve some of those issues."},"2129":{"dur":5,"text":"It seems to be particularly important for young apprentices who don't really have anywhere else to go,"},"2134":{"dur":2,"text":"their families mightn't know, can't give the advice,"},"2137":{"dur":4,"text":"the RTOs aren't that highly engaged in what's happening in the workplace"},"2141":{"dur":7,"text":"and of course they're a bit scared to talk to the boss, so the mentoring programs got a big tick."},"2149":{"dur":12,"text":"What we found was that training quality wasn't identified as a significant factor in apprenticeship non-completions."},"2162":{"dur":4,"text":"That's not to say that training quality was uniformly brilliant but it's just that it wasn't -"},"2167":{"dur":6,"text":"because your TAFE or your private RTO isn't providing quite the quality of training that you might have expected,"},"2174":{"dur":1,"text":"it's not actually forcing people to drop out."},"2175":{"dur":4,"text":"What it may mean is that they would switch RTO to go somewhere else."},"2180":{"dur":4,"text":"It's not ideal but it doesn't seem to be a major factor in non-completions."},"2185":{"dur":8,"text":"But, in terms of learning support for disability, low levels of language, literacy and numeracy"},"2193":{"dur":6,"text":"and, if you're going to target anything in terms of the activities of RTOs it would be in that area."},"2200":{"dur":6,"text":"Because what it means is that apprentices who aren't aware of the complexity of what they're getting into,"},"2206":{"dur":6,"text":"who don't have good literacy skills, who start with the employer and then they hit TAFE or hit the RTO,"},"2213":{"dur":6,"text":"then find over time that their literacy skills aren't adequate to make it through."},"2219":{"dur":3,"text":"Certainly, anecdotally, and certainly if you look at NAPLAN and other things"},"2223":{"dur":5,"text":"there is certainly evidence about declining literacy in the pool of apprentices coming through."},"2228":{"dur":4,"text":"So the need for continuing focus on literacy"},"2233":{"dur":7,"text":"within the formal training program structure was also important."},"2240":{"dur":6,"text":"We'll wait and see what happens with the Fair Work Australia wage decision."},"2247":{"dur":7,"text":"We asked and we got very different views, even from employers."},"2254":{"dur":3,"text":"Some employers were saying wages were too low, we're happy to pay the extra,"},"2257":{"dur":2,"text":"we'll get better kids and we're just going to swallow it and get on with it."},"2260":{"dur":6,"text":"Others - group training organisations were really worried in terms of the impact on their charge out rates."},"2266":{"dur":3,"text":"It may play a role in attracting high quality candidates"},"2270":{"dur":4,"text":"and therefore getting better candidates meaning that retention rates go up,"},"2275":{"dur":3,"text":"but it could also lead to some employers,"},"2278":{"dur":4,"text":"particularly ones who are facing a lot of cost and competitive pressures,"},"2282":{"dur":4,"text":"cancelling contracts or opting not to take new apprentices on."},"2287":{"dur":8,"text":"As the point says, the consultations indicated wage levels are not a significant factor in non-completions"},"2295":{"dur":4,"text":"and that's because apprentices are reasonably aware of what they're going to get into"},"2299":{"dur":3,"text":"but again I'd just add my comment there about the age factor."},"2303":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think that's basically a bit of a wait and see one, to see what happens,"},"2307":{"dur":5,"text":"although it might be hard to disentangle the impact of the wage decisions from the general economic conditions."},"2313":{"dur":5,"text":"Then, I won't go through all of this in detail,"},"2318":{"dur":3,"text":"but basically we've looked at the bodies that would be responsible"},"2322":{"dur":8,"text":"for implementing the range of strategies that we've put in paper and the resource implications."},"2330":{"dur":4,"text":"I think our general view is that a lot of this doesn't require a massive injection of resources,"},"2335":{"dur":4,"text":"it just requires a re-focussing of roles, a stronger emphasis of roles in some areas,"},"2340":{"dur":4,"text":"a continuation of some programs, or a possible expansion of them."},"2345":{"dur":3,"text":"But particularly better coordination between the Australian Apprenticeship Centres"},"2349":{"dur":8,"text":"and the state training authorities at the front end and then during the process."},"2358":{"dur":3,"text":"That's just the appendix with all the definitions."},"2361":{"dur":4,"text":"So I think we'll leave it there and then take questions and discussions."}}
