was tremendous and it was helping."},"344":{"dur":5,"text":"I told Ann, \"If we were a physical school, you would now have a building named after you.\""},"350":{"dur":2,"text":"When she found out that I was living off of savings,"},"352":{"dur":3,"text":"she really stepped up and gave a larger donation,"},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"so that I could support myself with a salary."},"358":{"dur":3,"text":"Then, a few months later I actually got a text message from Ann."},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"She was at a conference where Bill Gates was

donation."},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"There have been several other folks."},"399":{"dur":3,"text":"A lot of them in kind of the tech world, who have come out to support this."},"403":{"dur":8,"text":"Diane: How has the whole vision changed since you first began?"},"411":{"dur":3,"text":"Salman: It's been a very organic process,"},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"literally just starting with tutorials for cousins."},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"As we've grown and even when we got that first funding,"},"421":{"dur":3,"text":"I always imagined Khan Academy of being the supplementary thing."},"424":{"dur":3,"text":"Like most people, you read news stories"},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"and you become cynical about the system, so to speak,"},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"and I never thought that we would be part of it."},"432":{"dur":3,"text":"Right from the get go a public school district reached out to us, in California and said,"},"436":{"dur":3,"text":"\"We're fascinated by some of the work y'all are doing.\""},"439":{"dur":4,"text":"\"How would you see this being used in a 5th grade math classroom?\""},"443":{"dur":5,"text":"We said, \"These tools, the software, the videos allow every student\""},"449":{"dur":1,"text":"\"to work at their own pace.\""},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"\"It allows the information delivery component of learning\""},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"\"to happen

own pace,"},"461":{"dur":3,"text":"teachers would get realtime information about where they all are."},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"Then, they could use that information to do focus interventions,"},"468":{"dur":3,"text":"to lead projects, to have the students tutor each other."},"472":{"dur":3,"text":"Within 2 weeks they said, \"This is a good idea.\""},"475":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Let's try it with 4 classrooms.\""},"477":{"dur":4,"text":"Since then, they've extended it to every classroom in the district, 5th through 8th grade."},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"Beyond that it's been 20,000 classrooms around the country."},"484":{"dur":6,"text":"Diane: Is that in any and all subjects, or just in math?"},"491":{"dur":4,"text":"Salman: The site we have, especially the videos, are fairly broad,"},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"especially in math and science."},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"They go all the way to college level biology and chemistry."},"501":{"dur":1,"text":"This pilot that we started with Los Altos,"},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"and this is where a lot of our interactivity is right now,"},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"was in mathematics."},"508":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: But, now?"},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"Salman: Now, we're starting to look beyond that."},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"We've recently launched a computer science on the site,"},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"which shows kind of the creative side of computer science."},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"Kids create portfolios of their work."},"519":{"dur":3,"text":"Los Altos in interested now in using that as part of computer science."},"522":{"dur":3,"text":"This is for elementary school kids to start to learn to program."},"526":{"dur":3,"text":"Our long-term goal is, as we have more content on the site,"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"both videos and interactive content,"},"532":{"dur":4,"text":"we think that elements of this can be introduced into almost any subject."},"536":{"dur":4,"text":"Diane: Do you have family in addition to your wife?"},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"Do you have small

children"},"550":{"dur":5,"text":"or is she out of the house and working there as well?"},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"Salman: My wife is a physician and she is working 3 days a week."},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"We also have my mother in law who lives with us."},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"We have kind of a hybrid solution going on."},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"Diane: How do you make your income?"},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"Salman: I now get a salary from the Khan Academy."},"572":{"dur":7,"text":"Diane: That's really fantastic in terms of trying to help other people."},"580":{"dur":4,"text":"You've done this clearly as a nonprofit."},"584":{"dur":5,"text":"Are you still offering these videos free of charge?"},"589":{"dur":5,"text":"Salman: Yeah. In 2007, when I was first filling out that paper work for the IRS,"},"594":{"dur":3,"text":"they say admission statement for your not-for-profit."},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"I said, \"Let me think of something.\""},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"I thought about it for about 4 minutes and I said,"},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"\"A free world-class education for anyone anywhere.\""},"605":{"dur":3,"text":"To a certain degree, the free part is part of our mission."},"608":{"dur":3,"text":"Yes, we intend to always have it to be free."},"612":{"dur":4,"text":"Which raises the question of, \"How are you going to support yourself?\""},"616":{"dur":4,"text":"Obviously, right now, we're foundation and philanthropically supported."},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"Hopefully, we can figure out ways."},"623":{"dur":4,"text":"We've already started licensing our content to for-profit companies"},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"who want to use it for other purposes."},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"We think there are ways that we can keep the mission sacred"},"632":{"dur":4,"text":"and keep it free, so that learning really is, it's an equal playing field."},"636":{"dur":6,"text":"Diane: Clearly, what you're talking about, the model you've mention,"},"643":{"dur":8,"text":"is sort of flipping the classroom, so that kids can study at home,"},"651":{"dur":3,"text":"do their homework in the classroom."},"655":{"dur":1,"text":"How does that work?"},"657":{"dur":4,"text":"Salman: To be clear, none of the ides that I talk about are kind of the medal level"},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"or even in the book, are new ideas."},"663":{"dur":5,"text":"To a large degree, they came to us from teachers or from parents or from students."},"668":{"dur":4,"text":"In these realy days, 2007, 2008, I started getting letters from teachers"},"673":{"dur":3,"text":"and they started talking about this idea of flipping the classroom."},"676":{"dur":4,"text":"You've given a lecture on meiosis, you've given a lecture on photosynthesis,"},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"or on factoring a polynomial,"},"683":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't have to use this valuable class time doing that anymore"},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"and doing it at the set pace, some of the kids are lost, some of them are board."},"690":{"dur":3,"text":"Instead, they can watch your stuff at their own time, at their own pace,"},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"and other resources that are out there."},"696":{"dur":3,"text":"They come to class time and they can do true problem solving, true interactivity."},"699":{"dur":5,"text":"Diane: Salman Khan, founder of the Khan Academy, his new book,"},"705":{"dur":4,"text":"The One World Schoolhouse."},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"Short break, right

the knowledge to kind of get out there"},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"and people to interact with it, we discover things like this."},"854":{"dur":3,"text":"We have heard of other people talk about this idea,"},"858":{"dur":3,"text":"of being able to reach the prison population."},"862":{"dur":1,"text":"This is great to hear that."},"864":{"dur":4,"text":"The unfortunate thing is that there is limited or no access to the Internet."},"868":{"dur":2,"text":"My suggestion would be to figure out a way"},"871":{"dur":2,"text":"to give at least limited access to the Internet,"},"873":{"dur":3,"text":"so that they could benefit from the true interactivity of the site"},"876":{"dur":1,"text":"and they can get kind of the updated information."},"878":{"dur":7,"text":"Diane: That restriction to the Internet, within prisons, is for a good reason."},"886":{"dur":6,"text":"What they've done here is to put it on disk and make it
