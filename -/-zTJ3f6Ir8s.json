that\nthe application won't work."},"319":{"dur":2,"text":"But actually explorers\nare proving the model."},"321":{"dur":3,"text":"So in some ways, that\ncategory of person"},"324":{"dur":6,"text":"is not as sort of risky\nas we might think."},"331":{"dur":3,"text":"So who is backing risk?"},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, there are various\ncategories that we come

risk banking."},"368":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, exactly."},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"Up until 2009, I\nthink we all thought"},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"that putting our money\nin a bank was no

activity."},"391":{"dur":1,"text":"Investors."},"392":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, investors\nlike myself believe"},"394":{"dur":1,"text":"that we can quantify risk."},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"And there are different\ntypes of investors."},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"There are angels there\nare venture funds."},"401":{"dur":4,"text":"So as I say, governments\nin particular"},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"believe
