you know,"},"30":{"dur":3,"text":"there's already more than a billion\nhungry people on this planet."},"33":{"dur":2,"text":"We're expecting that problem to get worse"},"35":{"dur":4,"text":"as world

oceans\nneed to be their most abundant"},"78":{"dur":3,"text":"so that the oceans can provide us\nas much food as possible."},"82":{"dur":3,"text":"That's something the oceans\nhave been doing for us for a long time."},"86":{"dur":3,"text":"As far back as we can go, we've seen\nan increase in the amount of food"},"90":{"dur":2,"text":"we've been able to harvest\nfrom our oceans."},"92":{"dur":2,"text":"It just seemed like\nit was continuing to increase,"},"94":{"dur":4,"text":"until about 1980,\nwhen we started to see a decline."},"99":{"dur":3,"text":"You've heard of peak oil,\nmaybe this is peak fish, I hope not;"},"103":{"dur":1,"text":"I am going to come back to that."},"104":{"dur":2,"text":"But you can see about an 18% decline"},"106":{"dur":4,"text":"in the amount of fish we've gotten\nin our world catch since 1980,"},"111":{"dur":1,"text":"and this is a big problem."},"112":{"dur":3,"text":"It's continuing, this red line\nis continuing to go down,"},"115":{"dur":1,"text":"but we know how to turn it around,"},"117":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's what I'm going\nto talk about today."},"120":{"dur":2,"text":"We know how to turn\nthat curve back upwards."},"122":{"dur":2,"text":"This doesn't have to be peak fish."},"124":{"dur":3,"text":"If we do a few simple things\nin targeted places,"},"127":{"dur":3,"text":"we can bring our fisheries back\nand use them to feed people."},"132":{"dur":3,"text":"First, we want to know where the fish are,\nso let's look where the fish are."},"135":{"dur":2,"text":"It turns out the fish,\nconveniently, are located"},"138":{"dur":4,"text":"for the most part, in our coastal areas\nof the countries; in coastal zones."},"143":{"dur":3,"text":"These are areas that national\njurisdictions have control over,"},"147":{"dur":3,"text":"and they can manage their fisheries\nin these coastal areas."},"151":{"dur":2,"text":"Coastal countries tend\nto have jurisdictions"},"153":{"dur":2,"text":"that go out about 200 nautical miles"},"155":{"dur":3,"text":"in areas that are called\nexclusive economic zones;"},"159":{"dur":3,"text":"this is a good thing that they can control\ntheir fisheries in these areas,"},"162":{"dur":3,"text":"because the high seas, which are\nthe darker areas on this map,"},"166":{"dur":2,"text":"are a lot harder to control things,"},"168":{"dur":3,"text":"because it has to be done internationally,\nyou get into international agreements;"},"172":{"dur":3,"text":"and if any of you were checking\nthe climate change agreement,"},"175":{"dur":2,"text":"you know this can be a very slow,\nfrustrating, tedious process"},"178":{"dur":4,"text":"so controlling things nationally\nis a great thing to be able to do."},"182":{"dur":2,"text":"How many fish are actually\nin these coastal areas"},"185":{"dur":1,"text":"compared to the high seas?"},"186":{"dur":4,"text":"You can see here about seven times\nas many fish in the coastal areas"},"191":{"dur":1,"text":"than there are in the high seas."},"192":{"dur":2,"text":"So this a perfect place\nfor us to be focusing,"},"195":{"dur":2,"text":"because we can actually get a lot done."},"197":{"dur":4,"text":"We can restore a lot of our fisheries\nif we focused in these coastal areas."},"201":{"dur":2,"text":"But how many of these countries\ndo we have to work in?"},"204":{"dur":2,"text":"There is something\nlike 80 coastal countries."},"206":{"dur":3,"text":"Do we have to fix fisheries management\nin all of those countries?"},"210":{"dur":3,"text":"So we asked ourselves, \"How many\ncountries do we need to focus on?\","},"213":{"dur":3,"text":"keeping in mind that the European Union\nconveniently manages its fisheries"},"216":{"dur":2,"text":"through a common fisheries policy."},"218":{"dur":2,"text":"So, if we got good fisheries management"},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"in the European Union\nand say nine other countries,"},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"how much of our fisheries\nwould we be covering?"},"226":{"dur":3,"text":"It turns out that the European Union\nplus nine countries cover"},"230":{"dur":2,"text":"about two-thirds\nof the world's fish catch."},"233":{"dur":3,"text":"If we took it up to 24 countries\nplus the European Union,"},"236":{"dur":3,"text":"we would be up to 90%;\nalmost all of the world's fish catch."},"241":{"dur":3,"text":"So we think we can work\nin a limited number of places"},"244":{"dur":1,"text":"to make the fisheries come back,"},"246":{"dur":2,"text":"but what do we have to do in these places?"},"248":{"dur":2,"text":"Based on our work in the US\nand elsewhere, we know"},"251":{"dur":3,"text":"that there are three key things\nwe have to do to bring fisheries back."},"255":{"dur":4,"text":"They are: we need to set quotas\nor limits on how much we take;"},"259":{"dur":4,"text":"we need to reduce by-catch, which is\nthe accidental catching and killing a fish"},"264":{"dur":2,"text":"that we're not targeting\n- and it's very wasteful -"},"267":{"dur":4,"text":"and three, we need to protect habitats,\nthe nursery areas, the spawning areas"},"272":{"dur":2,"text":"that these fish need to grow\nand reproduce successfully,"},"274":{"dur":2,"text":"so that they can rebuild\ntheir populations."},"276":{"dur":3,"text":"If we can do those three things,\nwe know the fisheries will come back."},"280":{"dur":1,"text":"How do we know?"},"281":{"dur":3,"text":"We know because we've seen it happening\nin a lot of different different places."},"285":{"dur":3,"text":"This a slide that shows\nthe herring population in Norway"},"289":{"dur":3,"text":"that was crashing since the 1950s,\nit was coming down."},"292":{"dur":3,"text":"When Norway set limits\nor quotas on its fishery,"},"295":{"dur":1,"text":"what happens?"},"296":{"dur":2,"text":"The fishery comes back."},"298":{"dur":3,"text":"This is another example\n- also happens to be from Norway -"},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"of the Norwegian Arctic cod;"},"304":{"dur":1,"text":"same deal - the fisheries crashing;"},"306":{"dur":1,"text":"they set limits on discards,"},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"discards of these fish\nthey weren't targeting,"},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"that get thrown overboard wastefully."},"312":{"dur":3,"text":"When they set the discard limit,\nthe fishery came back."},"316":{"dur":4,"text":"It's not just in Norway; we've seen this\nhappening in countries all over the world."},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"Time and time again,\nwhen these countries step in,"},"324":{"dur":3,"text":"and they put in sustainable fisheries\nmanagement policies,"},"327":{"dur":4,"text":"the fisheries, which are always crashing\nit seems, are starting to come back."},"332":{"dur":1,"text":"So, there is a lot of promise here."},"333":{"dur":2,"text":"What does this mean\nfor the world fish catch?"},"336":{"dur":4,"text":"This means that we could increase, we take\nthat fishery catch that's on the decline,"},"340":{"dur":1,"text":"and we could turn it upwards,"},"341":{"dur":4,"text":"we could increase it up\nto a hundred million metric tons per year."},"346":{"dur":1,"text":"So we didn't have peak fish yet."},"348":{"dur":1,"text":"We still have an opportunity"},"349":{"dur":3,"text":"to not only bring the fish back\nbut to actually get more fish"},"353":{"dur":2,"text":"that can feed more people\nthan we currently are now."},"356":{"dur":1,"text":"How many more?"},"357":{"dur":3,"text":"Right about now, we can feed\nabout 450 million people"},"361":{"dur":3,"text":"a fish meal a day based on\nthe current world fish catch,"},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"which, of course, you know, is going down."},"366":{"dur":3,"text":"That number will go down\nover time if we don't fix it."},"370":{"dur":2,"text":"But if we put\nfishery management practices"},"372":{"dur":4,"text":"like the ones I have described,\nin place in 10 to 25 countries,"},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"we could bring that number up"},"378":{"dur":4,"text":"and feed as many as 700 million people\na year a healthy fish meal."},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"We should obviously do this"},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"just because it's a good thing\nto deal with the hunger problem"},"388":{"dur":1,"text":"but it's also cost-effective."},"390":{"dur":5,"text":"It turns out fish is the most\ncost-effective protein on the planet."},"395":{"dur":4,"text":"If you look at how much fish protein\nyou get per dollar invested"},"399":{"dur":2,"text":"compared to all of other animal proteins,"},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"obviously, fish is\nthe good business decision."},"405":{"dur":1,"text":"It also doesn't need a lot of land,"},"407":{"dur":3,"text":"something that's in short supply\ncompared to other protein sources."},"410":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"411":{"dur":4,"text":"It doesn't need any land.\nIt doesn't need a lot of fresh water."},"416":{"dur":3,"text":"It uses a lot less fresh water\nthan for example, cattle,"},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"where you have to irrigate the fields"},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"so that you can grow the food\nto graze the cattle."},"425":{"dur":1,"text":"It also has a very low carbon footprint."},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"It has a little bit of a carbon footprint"},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"because we do have to get out\nand catch the fish,"},"431":{"dur":1,"text":"it takes a little bit of fuel,"},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"but agriculture can have\na carbon footprint in,"},"435":{"dur":3,"text":"and fish has a much smaller one\nso it's less polluting."},"438":{"dur":4,"text":"It's already a big part of our diet,\nbut it can be a bigger part of our diet,"},"443":{"dur":3,"text":"which is a good thing\nbecause we know that it's healthy for us."},"446":{"dur":4,"text":"It can reduce our risk of cancer,\nheart disease, and obesity."},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"Our ocean conservation\nmovement really grew out"},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"of the land conservation movements,"},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"and in land conservation,\nwe have this problem,"},"457":{"dur":3,"text":"where biodiversity is at war\nwith food production."},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"You have to cut down\nthe bio-diverse forest"},"465":{"dur":4,"text":"if you want to get the field\nto grow the corn to feed people with."},"469":{"dur":3,"text":"So, there's a constant push-pull there;\nthere's a constant tough decision"},"472":{"dur":3,"text":"that has to be made\nbetween two very important things:"},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"maintaining biodiversity\nand feeding people."},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"But in the oceans, we don't have that war."},"482":{"dur":3,"text":"In the oceans, biodiversity\nis not at war with abundance."},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact, they're aligned."},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"When we do things\nthat produce biodiversity,"},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"we actually get more abundance."},"492":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's important\nso that we can feed people."},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, there's a catch."},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"Didn't anyone get that?"},"499":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"Illegal fishing undermines the type\nof sustainable fisheries management"},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"It can be when you catch fish\nusing gears that have been prohibited,"},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"when you fish in places\nwhere you're not supposed to fish,"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"you catch fish that are\nthe wrong size or the wrong species."},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"Illegal fishing cheats the consumer,\nand it also cheats honest fishermen."},"518":{"dur":1,"text":"And it needs to stop."},"519":{"dur":3,"text":"The way illegal fish get into our market\nis through seafood fraud."},"523":{"dur":1,"text":"You might have heard about this."},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"It's when fish are labeled\nas something they're not."},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"Think about the last time you had fish;\nwhat were you eating?"},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"Are you sure that's what it was?"},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"Because we tested\n1,300 different fish samples,"},"533":{"dur":3,"text":"and about the third of them were not\nwhat they were labeled to be."},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"Snappers - nine out of ten\nsnappers were not snapper."},"539":{"dur":3,"text":"59% of the tuna we tested was mislabeled."},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"And red snapper - we tested 120 samples,"},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"and only seven of them\nwere really red snapper,"},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"so good luck finding a red snapper."},"552":{"dur":1,"text":"It's hard."},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"Seafood has a really complex supply chain,"},"555":{"dur":4,"text":"and in every step in this supply chain,\nthere's an opportunity for seafood fraud"},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"unless we have traceability."},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"Traceability is a way"},"563":{"dur":4,"text":"where the seafood industry can track\nthe seafood from the boat to the plate"},"567":{"dur":3,"text":"to make sure that the consumer can then\nfind out where their seafood came from."},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"This is a really important thing."},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"It's being done by some\nin the industry, but not enough"},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"so we're pushing a law in Congress\ncalled The Safe Seafood Act."},"578":{"dur":3,"text":"I am very excited today to announce\nthe release of a chef's

make sure"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"the quotas, habitat protection,\nand by-catch reductions"},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"can do the jobs they can do."},"618":{"dur":3,"text":"We know that we can
