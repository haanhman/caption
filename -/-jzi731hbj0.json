The"},"140":{"dur":5,"text":"fact is that leadership is really like an\niceberg. 90 percent of it is hidden"},"146":{"dur":4,"text":"below the surface.

So, what"},"244":{"dur":6,"text":"I'm suggesting here the tough part of strategy\nis strategy implementation. Not"},"250":{"dur":4,"text":"strategy formulation. Especially difficult\nin an organization like Google which"},"254":{"dur":9,"text":"has grown from 300 people five years ago to\n20,000.

But having been around organizational\nlife for many, many, years before I"},"311":{"dur":6,"text":"started teaching, I think there's very few\npeople in organizational life who"},"318":{"dur":7,"text":"match JFK, and Martin Luther King, or Gandhi,\nor Churchill and so forth. And"},"326":{"dur":6,"text":"finally, I don't think leadership is about\ntechnical skills. I mean, you're all"},"332":{"dur":6,"text":"very smart. Google is famous for having very\nsmart people and a hiring process"},"338":{"dur":5,"text":"that makes it foolproof that you'll be hired\nonly if you're very smart. But the"},"344":{"dur":5,"text":"fact is, umm, I don't think leadership's being\nthe smartest man or woman in the"},"349":{"dur":5,"text":"room. It's quite likely used -- you who manage\ngroups of people, you may have"},"355":{"dur":5,"text":"people working for you who are more technically\nexpert. I -- very often"},"360":{"dur":5,"text":"leadership is ant being from time to time\na curator or a conductor, as opposed to"},"366":{"dur":5,"text":"the smartest, most technically expert, functionally\nexpert person.

And I think"},"435":{"dur":5,"text":"management's important for every organization.\nBeing well-managed is important"},"440":{"dur":7,"text":"whether you're Google or AT&T. But if that's\nthe only thing you're good at, you"},"447":{"dur":6,"text":"ultimately become the Department of Motor\nVehicles. You become bureaucratic,"},"454":{"dur":4,"text":"lot of red tape, lot of policies, lot of procedures,\nlot of rules, which can be"},"459":{"dur":5,"text":"very unhealthy for any organization. So therefore\nit's very important to offset"},"464":{"dur":7,"text":"management-- with leadership. And what leadership\nis about is really establishing"},"472":{"dur":5,"text":"direction, Whether you're running a department\nor not, whether, in fact, you have"},"477":{"dur":5,"text":"a department or not. Establishing direction,\nfor me, is about the vision and"},"482":{"dur":6,"text":"the strategies to get there. It's also about\nbuilding alliances and coalitions"},"488":{"dur":3,"text":"so the product management people, and the\nengineers, and the sale -- sales"},"492":{"dur":4,"text":"people actually focus on the prize instead\nof fighting with one another, which"},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"can occur in any organization."},"498":{"dur":6,"text":"Michael: And finally, day in and day out,\nonce you cut through the game rooms"},"505":{"dur":6,"text":"and the free candy, how excited are you about\nyour jobs and about coming to work"},"511":{"dur":9,"text":"here, and about collaborating with the people\nin the next cubicle? That"},"521":{"dur":4,"text":"motivating and inspiring is one of the hardest\nthings to do in organizational"},"526":{"dur":5,"text":"life.

It's very hard"},"540":{"dur":6,"text":"to do. Next to raising teenagers, which I've\ndone four times, motivating and"},"547":{"dur":4,"text":"inspiring people every day, is very difficult.\nI don't know about the people in"},"552":{"dur":4,"text":"California or Washington, but if you take\nthe subway, the New York City subway to"},"556":{"dur":6,"text":"work every day, which many of you do, and\nyou look around at the misery on the"},"563":{"dur":1,"text":"faces of the people --"},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"[laughing]"},"565":{"dur":3,"text":"Michael: -- you get a sense that people aren't\nterribly motivated and inspired"},"569":{"dur":4,"text":"about going to work. It's actually quite tragic."},"574":{"dur":11,"text":"Michael: Not so funny. So, if management is\nabout predictability, and"},"585":{"dur":5,"text":"consistency, and order, then leadership is\nabout change and adaptability. An"},"590":{"dur":5,"text":"organization like Google and the space you're\nin has to be particularly"},"595":{"dur":8,"text":"adaptable given the technology and how quickly\nit changes in this space,"},"604":{"dur":8,"text":"adaptable to new technology, new competitors,\nnew regulation, new competitive"},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"responses, new customers."},"614":{"dur":11,"text":"Michael: So effective organizations are both\nwell-led and well-managed. Which"},"625":{"dur":5,"text":"means your challenge is to be concerned about\norder, and consistency, and"},"631":{"dur":3,"text":"predictability-- more than you have been in\nthe past, in my opinion. But at the"},"635":{"dur":7,"text":"same time, worried about vision and the strategies\nto get there, and motivating"},"642":{"dur":4,"text":"and inspiring people to bring their A-game\nto work. So how do you do that?"},"646":{"dur":9,"text":"Michael: I -- the thing that's particularly\nimportant with leadership is"},"656":{"dur":3,"text":"building \"followership\", particularly when\nthis is such a high-transaction,"},"659":{"dur":6,"text":"collaborative organization. Influencing people,\nnot relying on sanction power and"},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"authority, requires you to influence and persuade."},"669":{"dur":6,"text":"Michael: So leadership, in my view, is really\nabout building followership."},"675":{"dur":5,"text":"It's really about pulling people. It's much\nless about the use of power, and"},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"much more about empowerment of others."},"683":{"dur":11,"text":"Michael: It's really about taking people with\nyou. And all of that is about"},"695":{"dur":5,"text":"managing relationships. It's about managing\nrelationships down in the"},"700":{"dur":4,"text":"organization; it's about managing relationships\nup in the organization, sometimes"},"704":{"dur":7,"text":"with knuckle-head bosses. And particularly\nimportant here, at Google, it's about"},"712":{"dur":11,"text":"managing collaborative peer relationships.\nAnd all of that takes HTHC. All of"},"724":{"dur":5,"text":"that takes hand-to-hand combat. That is, it's\nall of those hundreds of"},"729":{"dur":6,"text":"transactions you have every day up, down,\nand across, that gets people to do what"},"736":{"dur":3,"text":"you think they need to do. That's really what\nleadership is about. Leadership"},"739":{"dur":4,"text":"has nothing to do with your title as you know,\nit has nothing to do with your"},"744":{"dur":4,"text":"sanction, power and authority. It has to do\nwith influencing and persuading"},"748":{"dur":5,"text":"people to do what you feel deeply is important\nto the success of this"},"753":{"dur":9,"text":"organization. That's why oratory, and strategy,\nand charisma won't help here."},"763":{"dur":4,"text":"This is why leadership is just like an iceberg,\nright? 90 percent of it is"},"767":{"dur":1,"text":"hidden below the surface."},"768":{"dur":14,"text":"Michael: So I wanna talk to you about tactically,\nvery real-world setting...How do"},"783":{"dur":1,"text":"you lead people to excel?"},"785":{"dur":13,"text":"Michael: And just as context, umm, I wrote\na book several years ago called \"The"},"798":{"dur":6,"text":"Feiner Points of Leadership\", where there\nare 50 laws, or rules, or principals"},"804":{"dur":7,"text":"that you could use to motivate and inspire\npeople every day.

My slides\nare gonna -- they're okay. Uh,"},"851":{"dur":5,"text":"this law can best be explained by telling\nyou a true story. 1968 California"},"856":{"dur":6,"text":"school district, and teachers are told that\ncertain third graders have scored"},"862":{"dur":7,"text":"very high on a late bloomer test, and to expect\na learning spurt over the ensuing"},"870":{"dur":5,"text":"school year. Lo and behold, at the end of\nthe school year, not only did these"},"876":{"dur":6,"text":"third graders improve their performance in\nthe classroom, but their IQ scores"},"882":{"dur":7,"text":"went up-- quite dramatically, quite unexpectedly,\ntheir IQ scores went up."},"889":{"dur":5,"text":"Surprising? There was no test. It was a ruse.\nIt was a ploy, it was an"},"895":{"dur":5,"text":"experiment now known as the Pygmalion Experiment\nbetween this very well-known"},"900":{"dur":6,"text":"social psychologist of the day, and this California\nschool district.

This is"},"936":{"dur":8,"text":"what I call the \"Law of Expectations\". In\nmy parlance what that means is, when we"},"944":{"dur":2,"text":"expect people to succeed, they usually do."},"947":{"dur":10,"text":"Michael: So let me say it another way. People\nrespond to the level of"},"957":{"dur":6,"text":"confidence you show in them. I would suspect\nthat in your own lives, given how"},"963":{"dur":4,"text":"successful and how smart you are, this had\nan enormous impact because I would"},"968":{"dur":1,"text":"suspect this was the way you were parented."},"970":{"dur":9,"text":"Michael: The fact is, however, this is an\nimportant attitude or mindset to have"},"979":{"dur":6,"text":"particularly in a collaborative relationship,\nwhere you need ultimately to expect"},"985":{"dur":4,"text":"people to meet or exceed your expectations,\nbecause if you have people working"},"990":{"dur":5,"text":"for you in some cases who don't, they know\nit regardless of what you tell them."},"995":{"dur":4,"text":"It's in the ether; it's in the oxygen.

It's always amazing\nto me when I go into"},"1024":{"dur":4,"text":"organizations where I do a fair amount of\nconsulting and very often leaders will"},"1029":{"dur":3,"text":"say, you know, I'm not happy with my team\nand I'd like you to talk with my"},"1033":{"dur":9,"text":"people to sort out how I can raise my game;\nhow I can groove my team.
