affect you."},"30":{"dur":1,"text":"Ryan: Hey, Ben."},"31":{"dur":1,"text":"Thanks for coming on today."},"32":{"dur":1,"text":"Ben: Good day, guys."},"33":{"dur":3,"text":"Sorry to be the bearer of not-so-good news\ntoday."},"37":{"dur":2,"text":"Ryan: [inaudible 00:37] out there."},"39":{"dur":5,"text":"I'm not a mortgage broker or financial adviser\nso none of this should be considered mortgage"},"44":{"dur":1,"text":"or financial advise."},"46":{"dur":1,"text":"This is for educational purposes only."},"47":{"dur":7,"text":"So, Ben, why don't you give us a quick rundown\nof what the hell happened, man?"},"55":{"dur":2,"text":"Ben: Just want to put the same disclaimer\nin."},"57":{"dur":4,"text":"Obviously, I'm just noticing what's happening\nto my investors and I'm definitely not an"},"62":{"dur":1,"text":"advisor."},"63":{"dur":3,"text":"[inaudible 1:01] I'm also noticing what's\nhappening with my investment properties as"},"66":{"dur":1,"text":"well."},"67":{"dur":7,"text":"So, basically, probably 9 weeks ago now, there\nstarted to be a bit of buzz from APRA, which"},"75":{"dur":6,"text":"is a government body who - Ryan just put it\nreally well - kind of like the UN of the Australian"},"82":{"dur":5,"text":"property investment lending market and they\ngot together and they said that because of"},"87":{"dur":5,"text":"how hot the market is right now in places\nlike Sydney and Melbourne, and because we've"},"92":{"dur":4,"text":"got an all-time high for investment lending,\nthey've come in and started to tighten up"},"97":{"dur":1,"text":"a few things."},"98":{"dur":6,"text":"Basically, 10 weeks ago, it was very easy\nfor investors to get money and today, it's"},"105":{"dur":3,"text":"still easy if you know the right people but\nit's definitely tightening up from where it"},"109":{"dur":1,"text":"was."},"110":{"dur":1,"text":"Ryan: Okay."},"111":{"dur":6,"text":"Just so people know, APRA stands for the Australian\nPrudential Regulation Authority."},"117":{"dur":6,"text":"What Ben was telling me was basically they\nprovide the guidelines to the banks as to"},"124":{"dur":4,"text":"how they should regulate their lending and\nwhat sort of guidelines they should use when"},"128":{"dur":2,"text":"they're working out how much to lend."},"131":{"dur":4,"text":"We're talking about loan-to-value ratios;\nwe're talking about interest rates and stuff"},"136":{"dur":1,"text":"like that."},"137":{"dur":5,"text":"I think they don't provide law to the banks\nand say, \"You have to do this.\""},"143":{"dur":4,"text":"but they're kind of an industry body that\nsays, \"We think that the whole industry should"},"147":{"dur":2,"text":"abide by these rules to make sure we don't\nhave -\""},"150":{"dur":2,"text":"Are they trying to avoid a major crash?"},"152":{"dur":1,"text":"Or what's the goal?"},"153":{"dur":4,"text":"Ben: That's exactly where the people that\nI've been speaking to in the mortgage brokers"},"157":{"dur":4,"text":"in my network and the guys that I've been\nreading are sort of saying where it's going."},"162":{"dur":7,"text":"If unregulated, these guys continue to loan\nto investors, because investors in Australia"},"169":{"dur":6,"text":"are the last period of roughly 6 months have\nrepresented over 50% of property buyers in"},"176":{"dur":2,"text":"Australia, which is completely unprecedented."},"178":{"dur":5,"text":"So, they're just putting the brakes on and\ntrying to slow down the market a little bit."},"183":{"dur":1,"text":"Ryan: What's it been previously?"},"185":{"dur":3,"text":"Like with percentage of homeowners purchasing\nproperties versus investors?"},"189":{"dur":3,"text":"Like, you say 50-50 is unprecedented, what\nis it usually?"},"192":{"dur":6,"text":"Ben: It really depends on sources, but a good\nlevel of investment lending would be between"},"199":{"dur":3,"text":"sort of 10% and 25% as an industry standard."},"202":{"dur":1,"text":"Ryan: Okay."},"203":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's a big difference."},"204":{"dur":2,"text":"Ben: Significantly more loan being written\nto investors."},"207":{"dur":1,"text":"Ryan: Okay."},"208":{"dur":4,"text":"So, what exactly did APRA say to the banks\nthat they should be doing?"},"213":{"dur":4,"text":"And how does that affect homeowners and how\ndoes it affect investors?"},"218":{"dur":5,"text":"Ben: Again, based on the conversations that\nI've had with people inside my network, there's"},"224":{"dur":6,"text":"basically 5 major changes that have been,\nas you said, not put into law but just guidelines"},"230":{"dur":2,"text":"for the banks to begin following."},"233":{"dur":5,"text":"The first major change is the reduction in\nmaximum loan-to-value ratios."},"239":{"dur":5,"text":"Over the last 3 to 4 years, people like myself\nand a lot of other investors have been able"},"244":{"dur":7,"text":"to access relatively cheap money at very cheap\nrates or very cheap LVR."},"251":{"dur":6,"text":"It wasn't uncommon before the last 12 weeks\nfor investors to be getting 95% loans."},"257":{"dur":6,"text":"Or if they had good equity in another property\nor good cash, 100% loans or 105% loans."},"264":{"dur":5,"text":"So, their stamp duty plus their lenders insurance\nand all of that cost are being covered by"},"269":{"dur":1,"text":"the banks as well."},"271":{"dur":5,"text":"Ryan: Is this for investors who already own\nproperty and withdrawing on equity in order"},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"to invest or is this for new investors?"},"279":{"dur":5,"text":"Because I've never seen 105% loans be applicable\nto people who are trying to get into the market."},"284":{"dur":1,"text":"Ben: Okay."},"285":{"dur":1,"text":"Sorry, yeah."},"286":{"dur":1,"text":"So, just to clarify what Ryan just said."},"287":{"dur":1,"text":"Great point."},"289":{"dur":6,"text":"105% loans only exist for people with existing\nproperty and really good equity in those properties."},"295":{"dur":5,"text":"It's definitely not for those people that\nare buying their first property, by any means."},"301":{"dur":6,"text":"By accessing 105%, if owned a property in\nSydney worth $400,000, it's now at $600,000."},"308":{"dur":8,"text":"Traditionally, you could pull out 80% up to\n95% of that $200,000 in equity and use that"},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"as your cash down in your next investment\nproperty."},"318":{"dur":1,"text":"Ryan: Yeah."},"319":{"dur":3,"text":"So you could take the loan-to-value ratio\nof your first property, you could push it"},"323":{"dur":5,"text":"all the way up to 95%, so you access the most\namount of money possible and you could then"},"328":{"dur":4,"text":"take that equity to use as your deposit for\nyour next property and get lending on that"},"333":{"dur":1,"text":"as well."},"334":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's what used to happen."},"335":{"dur":4,"text":"So now, are you saying that you can't borrow\nup to 95% on equity."},"340":{"dur":1,"text":"Have they squashed that down?"},"341":{"dur":6,"text":"Ben: I would say, just to add something to\nthat as well, it's never sensible to borrow"},"348":{"dur":3,"text":"up to 95% of the exact equity in an existing\nproperty."},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"It puts you in a really vulnerable state."},"353":{"dur":2,"text":"Most investors would borrow up to about 80%."},"356":{"dur":7,"text":"But for that new loan, people were borrowing,\nas I said, up to 95% of that loan."},"363":{"dur":6,"text":"So, using the equity as cash to put 5% deposit\ndown plus closing cost paid for by the equity"},"370":{"dur":1,"text":"like cash in that new loan."},"371":{"dur":1,"text":"Ryan: Okay."},"373":{"dur":3,"text":"So, let's say there's someone who owns 1 investment\nproperty and they're looking to buy a second"},"376":{"dur":1,"text":"investment property."},"378":{"dur":4,"text":"In the past, what they would do, they had\nequity in the first one, they would draw upon"},"382":{"dur":6,"text":"that equity, pushing the loan-to-value ratio\nup to 80% for that to get 5% deposit for the"},"388":{"dur":2,"text":"second property plus your closing cost."},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"And they would then borrow another 95% for\nthat second property."},"394":{"dur":2,"text":"So, that's what used to happen."},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"So what's the go now?"},"398":{"dur":4,"text":"Are we limited on the equity we draw from\nthe properties we already own or are we limited"},"403":{"dur":5,"text":"on the loan-to-value ratio and how much we\ncan borrow for the new investment properties"},"409":{"dur":1,"text":"we're buying?"},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"Ben: So, that's kind of like exactly a great\nquestion."},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"It's almost a double-edged sword at the moment."},"415":{"dur":6,"text":"You can pull less money from your existing\nequity and you also need to put more money"},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"down on a new deposit."},"423":{"dur":5,"text":"When I say that they're making reductions\nin the maximum loan-to-value ratio, instead"},"428":{"dur":5,"text":"of 100% and 95% loans, there's only a couple\nof major lenders in the marketplace now doing"},"434":{"dur":1,"text":"90% loans."},"435":{"dur":7,"text":"And a couple of the major lenders have also\nsaid that they're either moving towards 80%"},"443":{"dur":4,"text":"loan-to-value ratios; meaning you need 20%\nof the cost of the property to actually purchase"},"448":{"dur":1,"text":"it."},"449":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's a scary thing because there's not\na huge amount of people in the marketplace"},"453":{"dur":5,"text":"that have a spare 20% of $600,000 sitting\naround as cash or a valuable equity."},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"Ryan: Yeah."},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"Have you got a lazy $120,000 that I can use\nto invest in a property?"},"463":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay."},"464":{"dur":3,"text":"So, there'll be a lot of people listening\nto this that are absolutely freaking out right"},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"now."},"469":{"dur":5,"text":"I know that when I first heard about this,\nme and my wife were planning to buy our house,"},"475":{"dur":4,"text":"like our first property, next year - at the\nend of the financial year."},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"And I was under the impression, \"Okay."},"480":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, maybe we can't because we have only\n5% to 10% deposit.\""},"485":{"dur":5,"text":"Does this just affect investors who already\nown property or how does this affect homeowners?"},"490":{"dur":6,"text":"Because I've heard that it affects investors\nheavily but it actually, it kind of benefits"},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"homeowners or doesn't affect them at all?"},"499":{"dur":1,"text":"Can we talk about that?"},"500":{"dur":1,"text":"Ben: Yeah."},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"I suppose there's winners and losers with\neverything."},"504":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, if somebody's losing, obviously, somebody's\nbeing propped up to win."},"509":{"dur":4,"text":"So, the people that are most affected are\nthe lowest income earners, obviously, I'm"},"514":{"dur":5,"text":"watching those guys always get the worst end\nof the stick; the middle income earners that"},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"own multiple properties."},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's say you're on a combined household income\nof $100,000 per year."},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"And you are in your own home and 1 investment\nproperty."},"528":{"dur":5,"text":"It's now harder to move into investment property\n2 than it was, say, 12 weeks ago."},"534":{"dur":4,"text":"Those with really high loan-to-value ratios\n- those people that were over-capitalised"},"538":{"dur":7,"text":"and were borrowing the 95% over the last couple\nof years - and anybody with more than 3 properties,"},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"I suppose, is going to be hit harder because\nof some of the other changes."},"549":{"dur":3,"text":"But then, on the flip side, there's a lot\nof people that wins."},"553":{"dur":5,"text":"So, as you said, first home buyers are almost\nunaffected by this, outside of potentially"},"558":{"dur":1,"text":"needing to come up with more deposits."},"560":{"dur":5,"text":"But for first time owners, there are some\nbanks that will still look at 90%-95% loans"},"566":{"dur":5,"text":"just for that segment of the market; here's\nthose people with huge amounts of equity and"},"571":{"dur":6,"text":"low debt on their portfolios, which are in\na strong position; first time investors and"},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"home buyers."},"579":{"dur":3,"text":"So, they really want to encourage home buyers\nto come back into the marketplace and that's"},"582":{"dur":1,"text":"what this is all about."},"583":{"dur":5,"text":"Ryan: So, as a home buyer myself - or wanting\nto be a home buyer, obviously, you're not"},"588":{"dur":4,"text":"a mortgage broker, so we can't take this as\nadvise but do you think that a home buyer"},"593":{"dur":4,"text":"would be able to purchase a property with\na higher loan-to-value ratio than the 80%"},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"up to 90% or 95%?"},"600":{"dur":4,"text":"Ben: Again, as you said, neither of us are\nmortgage brokers but what I'm seeing from"},"605":{"dur":7,"text":"clients is, those people without massive amounts\nof property-related debt are far more able,"},"612":{"dur":3,"text":"right now, to move back into the market quicker\nand they're relatively unaffected."},"616":{"dur":1,"text":"Ryan: Okay."},"617":{"dur":3,"text":"And then let's talk about - because you were\nsaying, just 2 days ago, that there was some"},"621":{"dur":3,"text":"changes with the 4 major banks and they hiked\ntheir interest rates."},"625":{"dur":1,"text":"What happened there?"},"626":{"dur":7,"text":"Ben: I think everybody woke up on Tuesday\nor Wednesday morning and a number of the major"},"633":{"dur":3,"text":"banks had increased interest rates for investment\nlending."},"637":{"dur":5,"text":"For people that weren't on fixed interest\nrates by about between 0.25% or a quarter"},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"of a percent and half a percent."},"646":{"dur":8,"text":"And they also went back through everybody\nthat has loans with their bank."},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"Let me just rephrase that, sorry."},"655":{"dur":4,"text":"Some of the major banks, some people that\nowe money to those banks on investment loans"},"660":{"dur":6,"text":"woke up with between a 0.25% and 0.4% increase\non their interest rates."},"667":{"dur":5,"text":"I actually went into one of the major 4's\nthis morning just to double-check myself,"},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"nothing's happened to my loan at the moment."},"674":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I suppose, there's a difference between\nwhat they're setting in policy and sometimes"},"678":{"dur":3,"text":"what's actually being actioned out and it's\nprobably just a matter of time before it rolls"},"682":{"dur":1,"text":"out."},"683":{"dur":1,"text":"Ryan: Okay."},"684":{"dur":3,"text":"So, the banks have said that, \"We are going\nto be increasing our interest rates on variable"},"687":{"dur":9,"text":"loans by 0.25% up to 0.4% or 0.5% on new loans\nas well as existing variable loans.\""},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"is that right?"},"697":{"dur":1,"text":"Ben: Existing variable investor loans."},"699":{"dur":3,"text":"So, if you go in your own home and they know\nthat, that's completely fine."},"702":{"dur":4,"text":"It's just that investor market that's being\ntargeted right now and people with new loans"},"707":{"dur":1,"text":"for an investment product."},"709":{"dur":6,"text":"The great thing about it is the banks are\nlooking at reducing for home buyers their"},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"loans by 0.25% to 0.4%."},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"So, as I said, someone wins, someone loses."},"719":{"dur":1,"text":"Ryan: Yeah."},"720":{"dur":6,"text":"So, this definitely sounds like all of the\nfinance community is getting together to try"},"727":{"dur":4,"text":"and get investors out of the market - or not\nto get them out of the market but to slow"},"731":{"dur":4,"text":"investors getting in and to really push homeowners\nto get into the market."},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"Do you have any idea, why is that so important?"},"738":{"dur":2,"text":"That we have less investors and more home\nowners?"},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"Ben: That's a really good question."},"743":{"dur":4,"text":"I don't know enough about what's happening\nright now to probably answer that in detail."},"748":{"dur":6,"text":"But I know that 50% of people in the marketplace\nare investors."},"754":{"dur":4,"text":"Investors are more speculative, they're prepared\nto pay a premium to move into a marketplace,"},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"as we've seen in Sydney over the last 12 months."},"762":{"dur":6,"text":"When investors are the ones driving activity,\nthat's more unstable, I suppose, as to homeowners"},"768":{"dur":4,"text":"who buy, add value to an area over time and\nit just progressively increases."},"773":{"dur":5,"text":"Where, as you see with investors, it's flat-spike-flat-spike-stop\nthing and that's what they're trying to take"},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"out of the market, that bubble that we're\ntalking about."},"781":{"dur":1,"text":"Ryan: Yeah."},"782":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, I guess, when you're a homeowner looking\nat purchasing a property, you really are considering,"},"786":{"dur":3,"text":"\"what's the cost of this house?\", \"how is\nit going to affect my lifestyle?\" and \"is"},"790":{"dur":3,"text":"it worth living in this area?\" and if it's\nnot, then you move out of the area and you"},"793":{"dur":1,"text":"go somewhere else."},"794":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I guess, the supply and demand would,\nI guess, be more fluid and make more sense"},"799":{"dur":1,"text":"for a homeowner."},"800":{"dur":3,"text":"Whereas, investors who's just going after\nthe money or they're pushed because they feel"},"803":{"dur":4,"text":"like the market is going up and up and they\nneed to get in and offer more."},"808":{"dur":3,"text":"I can understand how that would spike in the\nmarket."},"811":{"dur":6,"text":"So, the recommendations that have been made,\nbasically, they are affecting people who already"},"817":{"dur":4,"text":"own properties and who want to grow their\nportfolio or even if you own properties, you"},"822":{"dur":3,"text":"might see increases in your interest rate\nfor your investment properties."},"826":{"dur":3,"text":"So, it's going to be harder to, I guess, grow\nyour portfolio."},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"It's still possible, though, right?"},"832":{"dur":1,"text":"Ben: 100%, still possible."},"834":{"dur":5,"text":"It means that, I suppose, you need a team\naround you of people that can provide great"},"840":{"dur":1,"text":"advise."},"841":{"dur":3,"text":"I know, Ryan, you've got a really high-quality\nmortgage broker in your network."},"844":{"dur":1,"text":"I've also got one in mine."},"846":{"dur":6,"text":"And it seems to be that it's definitely not\nimpossible, by any means, regardless where"},"852":{"dur":1,"text":"you are."},"853":{"dur":4,"text":"You probably just need a strategist, as opposed\nto just your normal bank manager guiding you"},"858":{"dur":1,"text":"through some of this stuff."},"859":{"dur":4,"text":"Only if you're at that pointy end where you're\non the borderline of hitting a serviceability"},"864":{"dur":1,"text":"limit."},"865":{"dur":4,"text":"If you've got available cash and equity or\nyou don't own any property, you probably won't"},"870":{"dur":1,"text":"have any problems."},"871":{"dur":4,"text":"It's just for those people that are close\nto some sort of servicing limit with the banks."},"875":{"dur":1,"text":"Ryan: Okay."},"876":{"dur":4,"text":"So, it's probably best, if people are looking\nto invest again, definitely go and see a mortgage"},"880":{"dur":1,"text":"broker."},"882":{"dur":4,"text":"Because you really need to understand how\nthis actually affects your situation."},"886":{"dur":3,"text":"Because from what I can understand, it's going\nto affect everyone differently, depending"},"890":{"dur":4,"text":"on whether you're a first homeowner, depending\non whether you're an investor but then, as"},"895":{"dur":5,"text":"well, depending on how much equity you have,\nhow many properties you own, what your income"},"900":{"dur":1,"text":"is, what the income from your properties is."},"902":{"dur":3,"text":"There's just so many different factors that,\ndepending on your situation, are going to"},"906":{"dur":1,"text":"affect you."},"907":{"dur":3,"text":"Do you think this will stay the same for the\nforeseeable future?"},"910":{"dur":2,"text":"Or do we see more major changes coming?"},"912":{"dur":1,"text":"Ben: Yeah."},"913":{"dur":4,"text":"I think, from the people that I've been speaking\nto, there's more changes coming."},"918":{"dur":4,"text":"Because the changes that have been made at\nthe moment are still not slowing the marketplace"},"923":{"dur":1,"text":"right now."},"924":{"dur":4,"text":"It's going to take a while for that effect\nto take place but I definitely see more changes"},"929":{"dur":1,"text":"coming."},"930":{"dur":5,"text":"And it having some effect on the marketplace\nin terms of slowing down that investor-related"},"935":{"dur":1,"text":"lending."},"936":{"dur":4,"text":"Ryan: So, is it kind of like the market's\njust moving so quickly, they've tried to put"},"941":{"dur":5,"text":"on the brakes but it's just skidded and the\nmarket's still going forward?"},"946":{"dur":5,"text":"Ben: Again, unfortunately, what generally\nhappens when interest rates begin to rise,"},"952":{"dur":4,"text":"everybody that hasn't bought, that's been\nthinking about it for the last 2 years, rushes"},"956":{"dur":2,"text":"into the marketplace to buy."},"958":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's generally because, as humans, we\nhave a fear of loss and higher interest rates"},"963":{"dur":4,"text":"means that - I could have bought something\nyesterday at a low rate and now, today, I'm"},"967":{"dur":1,"text":"looking up here."},"969":{"dur":4,"text":"For some reason, we rush back in and, for\nsome time, it's going to continue to fill"},"973":{"dur":5,"text":"the marketplace until they get to a point\nwhere it's sustainable or the news changes"},"979":{"dur":5,"text":"from positive to negative and people start,\nunfortunately, going down that [inaudible"},"984":{"dur":3,"text":"16:23] again where they don't think there's\nmoney to be made in property and they'll start"},"987":{"dur":3,"text":"putting into other asset classes again."},"991":{"dur":3,"text":"Which is probably the better time to buy a\nproperty, to be really honest with you."},"994":{"dur":2,"text":"Ryan: Which is when the market's going down,\nyou can get good deals."},"996":{"dur":6,"text":"It's so hard to work this stuff out because\nit's such major changes on a national level"},"1003":{"dur":6,"text":"and they're working with 20 million people\nor more and they're trying to adjust this"},"1009":{"dur":2,"text":"and there's time lags between what they do."},"1012":{"dur":3,"text":"It's hard for an average investor to say,\n\"What is going on?"},"1015":{"dur":2,"text":"How's this going to affect me?"},"1018":{"dur":2,"text":"Where should I invest?\""},"1020":{"dur":6,"text":"It sounds like the changes that have happened,\nthey're very unlikely to be reversed."},"1026":{"dur":3,"text":"If anything, they're going to be pushed forward\nand it's going to get even harder to get lending"},"1030":{"dur":1,"text":"for investors."},"1031":{"dur":5,"text":"Ben: Only in the short term, until the brakes\ndo occur on the property market."},"1037":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, everything's cycular."},"1039":{"dur":5,"text":"Again, at some point in the future, when the\nbanks stop making a billion dollars a quarter"},"1045":{"dur":4,"text":"in profit, they're money-making machines,\nthey're going to want to go back and say,"},"1050":{"dur":4,"text":"\"Well, we've played by your rules for the\nlast 6 to 12 months, the market's slowed up."},"1055":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's incrementally become easy to deal with\nagain.\""},"1058":{"dur":1,"text":"It's just a cycular thing."},"1059":{"dur":5,"text":"This isn't the first time something like this\nhas happened, by any means, and it definitely"},"1064":{"dur":1,"text":"won't be the last time, either."},"1066":{"dur":2,"text":"Ryan: Do you know when this has happened in\nthe past?"},"1069":{"dur":5,"text":"Because I

the\nloopholes in the system."},"1172":{"dur":5,"text":"Like with self-managed super funds, people\nare always asking, \"Can I buy my house in"},"1178":{"dur":4,"text":"my self-managed super fund and

people understand the\nmajor changes that have occurred so that they"},"1210":{"dur":3,"text":"understand how look at them when they walk\nin through the door."},"1214":{"dur":5,"text":"So, as we said, firstly, the reduction in\nthe maximum loan-to-value ratio; which means"},"1219":{"dur":5,"text":"instead of giving you 95% 2 months ago, they\nmight give you 90% today and in 2 months'"},"1225":{"dur":3,"text":"time, they might only give you 80% of the\nloan."},"1229":{"dur":3,"text":"The second thing is they've increased the\nservicing rate."},"1232":{"dur":6,"text":"So, in the past, if I've got a interest rate\non my own home of 4.5%, which is extremely"},"1238":{"dur":2,"text":"common at the moment in Australia."},"1241":{"dur":4,"text":"You might go into the banks to get an investment\nloan and they would consider your home based"},"1246":{"dur":2,"text":"on a 4.5% interest rate."},"1248":{"dur":6,"text":"What they've done now is added a 2% \"sensitised\"\nrate to your loans."},"1255":{"dur":4,"text":"So, on paper you're paying 4.5% and nothing\nwill change but the way that they look at"},"1259":{"dur":5,"text":"you is like you're paying an extra 2% or even\nup to 7.5% right now."},"1265":{"dur":4,"text":"So, from that perspective, if you're interest\nis almost doubled overnight, only in the bank's"},"1270":{"dur":4,"text":"eyes, it's far harder for you to

sense?"},"1288":{"dur":1,"text":"Ryan: Yeah."},"1289":{"dur":1,"text":"So, basically, let me just rephrase it and\nsee if I've got it."},"1291":{"dur":3,"text":"You're going to a bank to try and get a loan."},"1294":{"dur":3,"text":"A hypothetical situation, obviously."},"1297":{"dur":3,"text":"Someone's going to a bank to get a loan at\n4.5%."},"1300":{"dur":5,"text":"And this person, the investor is saying, \"Well,\nI've done my sums, I can afford 4.5%."},"1305":{"dur":2,"text":"It's going to cost me X dollars per month.\""},"1308":{"dur":5,"text":"But what happens in the bank's backend internal\nsystems, they are actually assessing you and"},"1314":{"dur":5,"text":"saying, \"Okay, well this investor is coming\nto us, can he afford this loan if interest"},"1320":{"dur":2,"text":"rates were 2% higher than that."},"1322":{"dur":4,"text":"So, 6.5% or even at the guidelines now, which\nis what, 7.25%.\""},"1327":{"dur":3,"text":"So they'll actually say, \"Okay, you're buying\na $300,000 house."},"1331":{"dur":6,"text":"You're getting the interest rate of 4.5% but\nwe're actually assessing your ability to service"},"1337":{"dur":5,"text":"this loan at 7.25% or 2% above whatever your\npaying.\""},"1342":{"dur":6,"text":"So, you're not paying more as an investor\nbut because they're assessing you at a much"},"1349":{"dur":5,"text":"higher interest rate, you're going to be able\nborrow less than you would if they just assessed"},"1354":{"dur":3,"text":"you at the market rate."},"1357":{"dur":1,"text":"Ben: Absolutely."},"1359":{"dur":3,"text":"One of the mortgage brokers that I spoke to\nrecently put it really simply."},"1362":{"dur":5,"text":"Basically, for every $600,000 you want to\nborrow right now, you need to be earning an"},"1368":{"dur":2,"text":"extra $5,000 per month of income."},"1370":{"dur":7,"text":"So, if you were in your own home that's worth\n$300,000 and you don't have any debt, then,"},"1378":{"dur":4,"text":"if you're earning $100,000 a year, you can\npretty much - let's just call it as a rule"},"1382":{"dur":4,"text":"of thumb -

forward."},"1406":{"dur":3,"text":"And they're the people that are struggling\nthe most right now."},"1409":{"dur":2,"text":"Ryan: Okay."},"1411":{"dur":7,"text":"From my understanding, these guidelines - didn't\nAPRA set limits on how many new loans or how"},"1419":{"dur":3,"text":"many new investor loans that the banks could\ngive?"},"1422":{"dur":3,"text":"Which probably affected the major banks more."},"1426":{"dur":6,"text":"Are there smaller lenders who may not be as\naffected by these guidelines implementation"},"1432":{"dur":4,"text":"and may still be able to give you access to\nhigher loan-to-value ratios and stuff like"},"1437":{"dur":1,"text":"that?"},"1438":{"dur":1,"text":"Ben: That's a really awesome point."},"1440":{"dur":6,"text":"Because it's mainly the majors that have been\ngiving a huge amount of investor loans and"},"1446":{"dur":1,"text":"they were the guys that were giving up to\n95%."},"1447":{"dur":6,"text":"Where, historically, a lot of the smaller\nbanks and financial institutions in Australia"},"1454":{"dur":1,"text":"already had these rules in place."},"1456":{"dur":2,"text":"They haven't had to change their business\nmodel at all."},"1459":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, those guys are the ones now where\na lot of people, instead of going through"},"1463":{"dur":5,"text":"top 4 are looking at those second tier lending\nfirms and those guys are still giving out"},"1469":{"dur":3,"text":"money like they were 3 months ago, it's business\nas usual."},"1473":{"dur":4,"text":"It's just more the bigger guys where APRA's\ncome in and said, \"You need to reduce over"},"1477":{"dur":3,"text":"the next 12 months your investment lending\nby a minimum of 10%.\""},"1481":{"dur":4,"text":"So, 1 out of every 10 people that come through\nthe door aren't going to get loans and they're"},"1486":{"dur":1,"text":"just going to make it harder for everybody\nelse."},"1488":{"dur":1,"text":"Ryan: Okay."},"1489":{"dur":1,"text":"That's good to know."},"1491":{"dur":3,"text":"Because, again as we said from the outset,\nwe're not mortgage brokers or anything like"},"1494":{"dur":1,"text":"that."},"1495":{"dur":4,"text":"We just kind of wanted to give a summary and\nan overview of how this may affect people."},"1500":{"dur":5,"text":"But if you are in the market and you're looking\nto invest, don't be scared by this."},"1505":{"dur":4,"text":"But go and speak to your mortgage broker because,\nas Ben said, there's lenders out there

be other options for you."},"1518":{"dur":4,"text":"So don't be completely scared and think that,\n\"Oh my goodness, I can never invest again.\""},"1522":{"dur":2,"text":"because that is not the case for most people."},"1525":{"dur":6,"text":"It's the fact that the government or, I guess,\nAPRA whoever they are, are trying to limit"},"1532":{"dur":4,"text":"the market and just make sure that we

freaking out as much."},"1679":{"dur":1,"text":"Ben: 100%."},"1681":{"dur":7,"text":"Just because you can't buy your $750,000 property\nin Sydney right now, 60K away from the

time."},"1818":{"dur":5,"text":"And Bank West was the only lender that didn't\ntake rental income into account."},"1824":{"dur":3,"text":"They took like an average yield of like 3%."},"1827":{"dur":7,"text":"This was like a 10.5% rental yield or 11%\nrental yield on this property and they would"},"1834":{"dur":1,"text":"only take 3%."},"1836":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, I just got over the line in terms\nof lending."},"1839":{"dur":3,"text":"Like, almost didn't get over the line."},"1843":{"dur":3,"text":"But then the deal fell through because the\nvaluation came through

look at it now, across the board,\n6% is where they've capped it Australia-wide,"},"1868":{"dur":1,"text":"every institution."},"1869":{"dur":4,"text":"So, it means that that serviceability of $400\na
