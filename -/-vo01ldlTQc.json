there is a way"},"30":{"dur":2,"text":"the world both envisions food,"},"32":{"dur":3,"text":"the way the world writes about food and learns about food."},"35":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's largely what you would find in these books."},"38":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's a wonderful thing."},"40":{"dur":2,"text":"But there's some things that have been going on"},"42":{"dur":3,"text":"since this idea of food was established."},"45":{"dur":2,"text":"In the last 20 years,"},"47":{"dur":2,"text":"people have realized that science"},"49":{"dur":2,"text":"has a tremendous amount to do with food."},"51":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, understanding why cooking works"},"54":{"dur":2,"text":"requires knowing the science of cooking --"},"56":{"dur":3,"text":"some of the chemistry, some of the physics and so forth."},"59":{"dur":2,"text":"But that's not in any of those books."},"61":{"dur":2,"text":"There's also a tremendous number of techniques"},"63":{"dur":2,"text":"that chefs have developed,"},"65":{"dur":3,"text":"some about new aesthetics, new approaches to food."},"68":{"dur":3,"text":"There's a chef in Spain named Ferran Adria."},"71":{"dur":2,"text":"He's developed a very

food"},"93":{"dur":2,"text":"is the old way."},"95":{"dur":3,"text":"And so a few years ago -- fours years ago, actually --"},"98":{"dur":2,"text":"I set out to say, is there a way"},"100":{"dur":4,"text":"we can communicate science and technique and wonder?"},"104":{"dur":2,"text":"Is there a way we can show people food"},"106":{"dur":2,"text":"in a way they have not seen it before?"},"108":{"dur":3,"text":"So we tried, and I'll show you what we came up with."},"111":{"dur":3,"text":"This is a picture called a cutaway."},"114":{"dur":2,"text":"This is actually the first picture I took in the book."},"116":{"dur":2,"text":"The idea here is to explain what happens"},"118":{"dur":2,"text":"when you steam broccoli."},"120":{"dur":2,"text":"And this magic view allows you to see"},"122":{"dur":2,"text":"all of what's happening"},"124":{"dur":2,"text":"while the broccoli steams."},"126":{"dur":2,"text":"Then each of the different little pieces around it"},"128":{"dur":2,"text":"explain some fact."},"130":{"dur":2,"text":"And the hope was two-fold."},"132":{"dur":2,"text":"One is you can actually explain what happens when you steam broccoli."},"134":{"dur":3,"text":"But the other thing is that maybe we could seduce people"},"137":{"dur":2,"text":"into stuff that was a little more technical,"},"139":{"dur":3,"text":"maybe a little bit more scientific, maybe a little bit more chef-y"},"142":{"dur":2,"text":"than they otherwise would have."},"144":{"dur":2,"text":"Because with that beautiful photo,"},"146":{"dur":2,"text":"maybe I can also package this little box here"},"148":{"dur":2,"text":"that talks about how steaming and boiling"},"150":{"dur":2,"text":"actually take different amounts of time."},"152":{"dur":2,"text":"Steaming ought to be faster."},"154":{"dur":3,"text":"It turns out it isn't because of something called film condensation,"},"157":{"dur":2,"text":"and this explains that."},"159":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, that first cutaway picture worked,"},"162":{"dur":3,"text":"so we said, \"Okay, let's do some more.\""},"165":{"dur":2,"text":"So here's another one."},"167":{"dur":3,"text":"We discovered why woks are the shape they are."},"170":{"dur":2,"text":"This shaped wok doesn't work very well;"},"172":{"dur":2,"text":"this caught fire three times."},"174":{"dur":2,"text":"But we had a philosophy,"},"176":{"dur":3,"text":"which is it only has to look good for a thousandth of a second."},"179":{"dur":2,"text":"(Laughter)"},"181":{"dur":2,"text":"And one of our canning cutaways."},"183":{"dur":3,"text":"Once you start cutting things in half, you kind of get carried away,"},"186":{"dur":3,"text":"so you see we cut the jars in half as well as the pan."},"189":{"dur":2,"text":"And each of these text blocks"},"191":{"dur":2,"text":"explains a key thing that's going on."},"193":{"dur":3,"text":"In this case, boiling water canning"},"196":{"dur":2,"text":"is for canning things that are already pretty acidic."},"198":{"dur":2,"text":"You don't have to heat them up as hot"},"200":{"dur":3,"text":"as you would something you do pressure canning"},"203":{"dur":3,"text":"because bacterial spores can't grow in the acid."},"207":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is great for pickled vegetables,"},"209":{"dur":2,"text":"which is what we're canning here."},"211":{"dur":2,"text":"Here's our hamburger cutaway."},"213":{"dur":2,"text":"One of our philosophies in the book"},"215":{"dur":2,"text":"is that no dish"},"217":{"dur":2,"text":"is really intrinsically any better than any other dish."},"219":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can lavish"},"221":{"dur":3,"text":"all the same care, all the same technique,"},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"on a hamburger"},"226":{"dur":2,"text":"as you would on some much more fancy dish."},"228":{"dur":3,"text":"And if you do lavish as much technique as possible,"},"231":{"dur":2,"text":"and you try to make the highest quality hamburger,"},"233":{"dur":2,"text":"it gets to be a little bit involved."},"235":{"dur":2,"text":"The New York Times ran a piece"},"237":{"dur":2,"text":"after my book was delayed"},"239":{"dur":3,"text":"and it was called \"The Wait for the 30-Hour Hamburger"},"242":{"dur":2,"text":"Just Got Longer.\""},"244":{"dur":3,"text":"Because our hamburger recipe, our ultimate hamburger recipe,"},"247":{"dur":3,"text":"if you make the buns and you marinate the meat and you do all this stuff,"},"250":{"dur":2,"text":"it does take about 30 hours."},"252":{"dur":2,"text":"Of course, you're not actually working the whole time."},"254":{"dur":2,"text":"Most of the time is kind of sitting there."},"256":{"dur":2,"text":"The point of this cutaway"},"258":{"dur":2,"text":"is to show people a view of hamburgers they haven't seen before"},"260":{"dur":2,"text":"and to explain the physics of hamburgers"},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"and the chemistry of hamburgers,"},"264":{"dur":3,"text":"because, believe it or not, there is something to the physics and chemistry --"},"267":{"dur":3,"text":"in particular, those flames underneath the burger."},"270":{"dur":3,"text":"Most of the characteristic char-grilled taste"},"273":{"dur":3,"text":"doesn't come from the wood or the charcoal."},"276":{"dur":3,"text":"Buying mesquite charcoal will not actually make that much difference."},"279":{"dur":3,"text":"Mostly it comes from fat pyrolyzing, or burning."},"282":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's the fat that drips down and flares up"},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"that causes the characteristic taste."},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"Now you might wonder, how do we make these cutaways?"},"289":{"dur":2,"text":"Most people assume we use Photoshop."},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"And the answer is: no, not really;"},"293":{"dur":3,"text":"we use a machine shop."},"296":{"dur":3,"text":"And it turns out, the best way to cut things in half"},"299":{"dur":3,"text":"is to actually cut them in half."},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"So we have two halves of one of the best kitchens in the world."},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"(Laughter)"},"306":{"dur":4,"text":"We cut a $5,000 restaurant oven in half."},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"The manufacturer said,"},"312":{"dur":2,"text":"\"What would it take for you to cut one in half?\""},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"I said, \"It would have to show up free.\""},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"And so it showed up, we used it a little while,"},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"we cut it in half."},"320":{"dur":3,"text":"Now you can also see a little bit how we did some of these shots."},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"We would glue a piece of Pyrex"},"325":{"dur":3,"text":"or heat-resistant glass in front."},"328":{"dur":3,"text":"We used a red, very high-temperature silicon to do that."},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"The great thing is, when you cut something in half,"},"333":{"dur":2,"text":"you have another half."},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"So you photograph that in exactly the same position,"},"337":{"dur":2,"text":"and then you can substitute in --"},"339":{"dur":3,"text":"and that part does use Photoshop -- just the edges."},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's very much like in a Hollywood movie"},"344":{"dur":2,"text":"where a guy flies through the air, supported by wires,"},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"and then they take the wires away digitally"},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"so you're flying through the air."},"350":{"dur":2,"text":"In most cases, though, there was no glass."},"352":{"dur":3,"text":"Like for the hamburger, we just cut the damn barbecue."},"355":{"dur":3,"text":"And so those coals that kept falling off the edge,"},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"we kept having to put them back up."},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"But again, it only has to work for a thousandth of a second."},"362":{"dur":3,"text":"The wok shot caught fire three times."},"365":{"dur":2,"text":"What happens when you have your wok cut in half"},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"is the oil goes down into the fire"},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"and whoosh!"},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"One of our cooks lost his eyebrows that way."},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"But hey, they grow back."},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"In addition to cutaways,"},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"we also explain physics."},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"This is Fourier's law of heat conduction."},"381":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a partial differential equation."},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"We have the only cookbook in the world"},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"that has partial differential equations in it."},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"But to make them palatable,"},"389":{"dur":3,"text":"we cut it out of a steel plate and put it in front of a fire"},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"and photographed it like this."},"394":{"dur":3,"text":"We've got lots of little tidbits in the book."},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"Everybody knows that your various appliances"},"399":{"dur":3,"text":"have wattage, right?"},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"But you probably don't know that much about James Watt."},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"But now you will; we put a biography of James Watt in."},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a little couple paragraphs"},"409":{"dur":3,"text":"to explain why we call that unit of heat the watt,"},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"and where he got his inspiration."},"414":{"dur":3,"text":"It turned out he was hired by a Scottish distillery"},"417":{"dur":2,"text":"to understand why they were burning so damn much peat"},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"to distill the whiskey."},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"We also did a lot of calculation."},"423":{"dur":2,"text":"I personally wrote thousands of lines of code"},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"to write this cookbook."},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"Here's a calculation"},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"that shows how the intensity of a barbecue,"},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"or other radiant heat source, goes"},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"as you move away from it."},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"So as you move vertically away from this surface,"},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"the heat falls off."},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"As you move side to side, it moves off."},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"That horn-shaped region"},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"is what we call the sweet spot."},"445":{"dur":3,"text":"That's the place where the heat is even to within 10 percent."},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's the place where you really want to cook."},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's got this funny horn-shaped thing,"},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"which as far as I know, again,"},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"the first cookbook to ever do this."},"456":{"dur":3,"text":"Now it may also be the last cookbook that ever does it."},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, there's two ways"},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"you can make a product."},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"You can do lots of market research"},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"and do focus groups"},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"and figure out what people really want,"},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"or you can just kind of go for it"},"471":{"dur":3,"text":"and make the book you want and hope other people like it."},"474":{"dur":3,"text":"Here's a step-by-step that shows grinding hamburger."},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"If you really want great hamburger,"},"479":{"dur":3,"text":"it turns out it makes a difference if you align the grain."},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's really simple, as you can see here."},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"As it comes out of the grinder, you just have a little tray,"},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"and you just take it off in little passes,"},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"build it up, slice it vertically."},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"Here's the final hamburger."},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the 30-hour hamburger."},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"We make every aspect of this burger."},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"The lettuce has got liquid smoke infused into it."},"499":{"dur":3,"text":"We also have things about how to make the bun."},"502":{"dur":3,"text":"There's a mushroom, ketchup -- it goes on and on."},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"Now watch closely.
