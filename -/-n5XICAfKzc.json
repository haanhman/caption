Northern"},"40":{"dur":3,"text":"Ireland government and who\nhas recently inherited a lab."},"44":{"dur":2,"text":"And Arlene deserves huge\nkudos, because not only"},"47":{"dur":2,"text":"has she battled the\ntube strike today,"},"50":{"dur":2,"text":"she's also technically\non holiday."},"52":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think this is a real\ncommitment to innovation."},"56":{"dur":2,"text":"We also have Professor\nStephen Goldsmith,"},"59":{"dur":2,"text":"who has had a wide-ranging\ncareer, serving"},"62":{"dur":3,"text":"as the mayor of Indianapolis,\ndeputy mayor of New

here."},"123":{"dur":4,"text":"No, it is really good to be here\nwith such a stellar cast today."},"128":{"dur":4,"text":"I inherited Finance and\nPersonnel, the

mind,"},"140":{"dur":1,"text":"as my civil servants\nwill tell you."},"142":{"dur":2,"text":"I was a minister for Enterprise,\nTrade, and Investment"},"144":{"dur":1,"text":"in Northern Ireland\nfor seven years."},"146":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's quite a long\ntenure for public office,"},"149":{"dur":1,"text":"as you can imagine."},"150":{"dur":2,"text":"But during that\ntime, we were really"},"152":{"dur":2,"text":"trying to grapple with\ninnovation, because"},"154":{"dur":1,"text":"from the point of view\nof Northern Ireland,"},"156":{"dur":2,"text":"we were the 12th\nout of 12 regions"},"159":{"dur":1,"text":"in the United Kingdom\nin terms of how we"},"161":{"dur":1,"text":"were dealing with innovation."},"162":{"dur":2,"text":"So there was a\nreal need to bring"},"164":{"dur":3,"text":"about a more innovative way\nof doing things, not just"},"168":{"dur":3,"text":"in the private sector, but\nvery much in the public sector"},"171":{"dur":0,"text":"as well."},"172":{"dur":2,"text":"So of course, we\ndid what government"},"174":{"dur":1,"text":"does best, and\ndrew up a strategy"},"176":{"dur":1,"text":"to deal with innovation."},"177":{"dur":2,"text":"But more importantly\nthan that, we also"},"180":{"dur":3,"text":"set about putting\nin place some labs."},"183":{"dur":4,"text":"And the first of those labs\nwent live in June of last year."},"187":{"dur":3,"text":"It dealt with a peculiar\npolicy in Northern Ireland,"},"191":{"dur":2,"text":"regulatory impact\nassessments, which"},"194":{"dur":3,"text":"have to be carried out on\nall policies brought forward."},"197":{"dur":4,"text":"And it was a very good\nengagement and brought forward,"},"201":{"dur":5,"text":"importantly for me, very good\noutputs for a red-tape survey"},"206":{"dur":2,"text":"that was going on at that time."},"208":{"dur":2,"text":"So it has worked\nwell, and now we're"},"211":{"dur":6,"text":"engaged in around 20 labs\nof varying policy areas."},"217":{"dur":2,"text":"Indeed, some look\nat technical issues."},"219":{"dur":3,"text":"But they're all happening\nnow in Northern Ireland."},"223":{"dur":4,"text":"And for me that's very pleasing,\nbecause politicians certainly"},"227":{"dur":2,"text":"do not have all of\nthe wisdom in terms"},"229":{"dur":3,"text":"of what is the best way to\nmove forward on public sector"},"232":{"dur":0,"text":"reform."},"233":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's good to\nbring people together"},"235":{"dur":4,"text":"in an environment where they\ncan be more experimental in what"},"239":{"dur":3,"text":"they're putting forward, as\nopposed to the strictures"},"243":{"dur":2,"text":"that politicians\nfind themselves in."},"246":{"dur":2,"text":"So it has worked well for\nus in Northern Ireland."},"248":{"dur":4,"text":"We believe it's a good way\nto bring forward policy"},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"and to bring forward new\nideas, so much so that we've"},"255":{"dur":4,"text":"now brought in the OECD\ninto Northern Ireland"},"259":{"dur":3,"text":"and asked them to look in at\nour policy areas, and asked them"},"263":{"dur":2,"text":"whether we should be doing\nthings differently as well."},"265":{"dur":4,"text":"And we're looking at those\nreports later on in the year."},"270":{"dur":2,"text":"Political sponsorship of\nthe lab, hugely important"},"273":{"dur":1,"text":"as far as I'm concerned."},"274":{"dur":2,"text":"Because once people\ncome into the lab"},"277":{"dur":2,"text":"and bring new ideas\nforward, unless there's"},"279":{"dur":3,"text":"a political backing for taking\nthose new ideas forward,"},"282":{"dur":3,"text":"then you will not get\nthe buy-in from the rest"},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"of the ecosystem in politics."},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's why having\npolitical buy-in"},"290":{"dur":1,"text":"is so critically important."},"292":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'm going to stop there,\nRuth, and be a very good girl"},"294":{"dur":0,"text":"Good."},"295":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you."},"296":{"dur":1,"text":"Professor Goldsmith."},"298":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm a long-time\npolitician, and I"},"300":{"dur":2,"text":"think I just heard\nyou accuse me of not"},"302":{"dur":5,"text":"having a monopoly on innovation,\nso this is disturbing."},"308":{"dur":3,"text":"Let me just think\nabout this quickly."},"311":{"dur":1,"text":"You think about\npolitical sponsorship."},"313":{"dur":4,"text":"I was a mayor of the 12th\nlargest city in the US back"},"317":{"dur":3,"text":"in the dark ages, in\nthe '90s, and set up"},"320":{"dur":1,"text":"one of these innovation units."},"321":{"dur":4,"text":"And as the political\nsponsor, I was"},"325":{"dur":1,"text":"convinced I was\nright at all times"},"327":{"dur":1,"text":"and that we set the\nunit up correctly."},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I became deputy\nmayor for Mike Bloomberg,"},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"and I inherited a couple of\ninnovation delivery units,"},"334":{"dur":1,"text":"not called that at the time."},"335":{"dur":3,"text":"One in charge of operations,\none in charge of sustainability."},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"And so then my sponsor\nwas Mike Bloomberg,"},"340":{"dur":2,"text":"and I was kind of the advocate\nfor the innovation delivery"},"343":{"dur":1,"text":"teams, not with that name."},"345":{"dur":1,"text":"And now we kind of teach\nand write about it."},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"So I've been at this and\nmade dozens of mistakes"},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"over the last three decades,\nreally, in this area."},"351":{"dur":3,"text":"So let me just make a\ncouple, maybe brief comments."},"355":{"dur":4,"text":"One, what you want from your\ninnovation delivery unit"},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"is disruption but not mayhem."},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"Because you're not doing\nany good if you're not"},"365":{"dur":0,"text":"disrupting the system."},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"But if you disrupt the\nsystem too much, then"},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"obviously, the chances of\ngetting across the goal line"},"371":{"dur":4,"text":"are quite slim, and a number\nof other issues happen as well."},"376":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think that's\nrelatively important."},"379":{"dur":3,"text":"And in my experience,\nboth for Mayor Mike"},"383":{"dur":3,"text":"and when I was a mayor, and\nwhat I'm doing at Harvard,"},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"is that the benefit of the\ninnovation delivery team"},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"is it has peripheral\nvision across the verticals"},"391":{"dur":3,"text":"and into the\nfor-profit marketplace."},"394":{"dur":2,"text":"And even in a\nrelatively small city"},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"like Indianapolis, a little\nless than a million people,"},"399":{"dur":3,"text":"where I appointed the cabinet\ndirectors, within only months"},"402":{"dur":1,"text":"they became captive\nof the information"},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"flows inside the verticals."},"405":{"dur":1,"text":"They're all loyal to me."},"406":{"dur":1,"text":"They're all smart people."},"407":{"dur":1,"text":"I appointed them."},"408":{"dur":4,"text":"But then their ability to\nthink broadly slowly kind of"},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"slips away."},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"So the innovation delivery\nteam, when I mean-- disruptive"},"417":{"dur":2,"text":"means it's able to think\nin a network fashion"},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"and across the verticals\nand shop good ideas."},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"Second, I think, in that\nregard is the following."},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is even more difficult,\nI think, in managing upward,"},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"which is that between\nthe innovation delivery"},"432":{"dur":9,"text":"unit and the bottom, there are\nlayers of managers who will be"},"441":{"dur":1,"text":"disrupted if you're successful."},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"Because the folks at the\nbottom have really good ideas"},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"about how to do their work,\nand they're just not getting up"},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"to the top, which\nis why you're there."},"449":{"dur":4,"text":"So how do you disrupt the system\nin a way that empowers them"},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"and manage the noise\nlevel that comes"},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"in to the middle\nmanagers-- and I have"},"456":{"dur":1,"text":"lots of examples about that."},"458":{"dur":0,"text":"But that's point two."},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"Point three is the following."},"461":{"dur":3,"text":"You can't stay at\nthis for a long time"},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"without really good benchmarks."},"466":{"dur":1,"text":"That means, OK, I'm\ngoing to touch this thing"},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'm going to\nfix it, which means"},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going to publicise the\nbenchmarks about quality,"},"472":{"dur":1,"text":"service level\nagreements, and price"},"474":{"dur":1,"text":"before I touch it and break it."},"476":{"dur":3,"text":"And then when I fix it\nagain, I have new data,"},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'm going to keep a\nscorecard-- dollars saved,"},"481":{"dur":1,"text":"customers improved, services."},"483":{"dur":3,"text":"And without the pre and\npost, then the advocates"},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"will always have a heyday\nbecause you're all-- I mean,"},"489":{"dur":3,"text":"I used to put up on my wall\nthis Machiavellian phrase, which"},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"we don't have time to say, but\nI'll paraphrase it basically."},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"Which is, the people\nwho are against you"},"496":{"dur":1,"text":"are really against you, and\nthe people who are for you"},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"don't even know\nwho they are yet."},"500":{"dur":3,"text":"Because the benefits\nare inchoate."},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's an\nimportant issue too."},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"And then lastly, I\nthink that it's worth"},"508":{"dur":5,"text":"mentioning that the management\nissues are all pretty simple."},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"Somebody will tell you\nthe management end."},"516":{"dur":3,"text":"What's difficult is the framing\nand the stakeholder management."},"519":{"dur":3,"text":"And if the innovation\ndelivery team doesn't own that"},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"explicitly, they\ncannot be successful."},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"And framing these,\nwhat's the big frame?"},"527":{"dur":3,"text":"So when we did 80 managed\ncompetitions and privatisations"},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"in Indianapolis, the frame was\nbuilding better neighbourhoods."},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"Because we took the proceeds\nfrom the competitions"},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"and invested in\nbetter neighbourhoods."},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"If I would have said to the\npublic, or my innovation unit,"},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"follow me, we're going\nto disruptively compete"},"543":{"dur":1,"text":"every public service."},"544":{"dur":2,"text":"They'd go, I'm not\ninterested in that."},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm interested in\nhigher quality service."},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"And so how do you\ndo the framing?"},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"And when you do the framing--\nand this is the last subpart"},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"of this-- I think the\nmost successful leaders"},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"of the innovation\ndelivery teams who"},"556":{"dur":1,"text":"are managing their\npolitics up are"},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"those who bring in\nstakeholders who don't really"},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"know that they're stakeholders."},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"For example, I've been\nfighting with taxicabs for now"},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"like three decades in\nIndianapolis and other cities,"},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"in New York City."},"568":{"dur":4,"text":"And in the Indianapolis example,\nfighting the taxi cartel,"},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"we went out and found\nan invaluable ally."},"575":{"dur":6,"text":"And that invaluable ally was\nthe preeminent leading minority"},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"advocacy group in Indianapolis."},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"Because their citizens\nweren't getting good help"},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"in their neighbourhoods."},"586":{"dur":3,"text":"Their small businesses couldn't\nget taxi cartel licences."},"590":{"dur":4,"text":"And so the framing and the\nstakeholder management means,"},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"managing up means\nyou help your boss"},"596":{"dur":1,"text":"because you identify\nstakeholders"},"597":{"dur":1,"text":"and you energise\nthe stakeholders."},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"You bring them to the game\nin support of the changes."},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"At the same time, you're\nmitigating the disruption"},"603":{"dur":0,"text":"that you're doing."},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"When you handle those\nthings, the politics"},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"are great, because the\nmayor gets to cut the ribbon"},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"and claim that it was his or\nher idea in the first place."},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"Thank you very much."},"614":{"dur":0,"text":"Thank you."},"615":{"dur":0,"text":"Yes."},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"I think it was very interesting\nhearing the conversations we"},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"had up to now."},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think the political\nundertones were coming up,"},"623":{"dur":1,"text":"meaning that people\nwere becoming quite"},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"aware in the conversations\nabout the political dimension"},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"of this."},"628":{"dur":3,"text":"I think we heard\nthings like movements."},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'll just put\nout there that I"},"633":{"dur":4,"text":"think innovation, as we\nprobably commonly share,"},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"will always invariably\nbe political."},"640":{"dur":1,"text":"But not party politics."},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that's a\nbig distinction."},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"Political in the sense\nthat you're ultimately"},"645":{"dur":1,"text":"ideologically driven."},"647":{"dur":3,"text":"You're ultimately thinking about\nwhat makes a better society."},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"And you're doing the job of\npoliticians, to some degree."},"652":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll come to this in a second."},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"But it's not party politics."},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'll speak from the\nnarrow perspective of Finland,"},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"where I come from, so\nsome of these things"},"660":{"dur":0,"text":"may or may not apply."},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think one of the\nchallenges is also"},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"thinking about the political\nsystem, the legacy of parties"},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"that we have, that\nemerged out of a very"},"668":{"dur":1,"text":"coherent point in\ntime where there's"},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"a need for a national\ntransformation to occur."},"672":{"dur":4,"text":"Which is basically going from\na rural agricultural economy"},"677":{"dur":1,"text":"to urban industrial economy."},"679":{"dur":1,"text":"And so then we had\nthe Farmers' Party,"},"681":{"dur":3,"text":"we had the Workers' Party and we\nhad the Business Owners' Party."},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"And that made sense back then."},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"But we don't have that same\ntransformation going on"},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"between agriculture\nand cities anymore,"},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"yet we're trying to use those\npolitical parties to create"},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"political change."},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"So this complicates it."},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't think the way is to\ncreate new political parties."},"699":{"dur":1,"text":"It's just too complicated."},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"But that we need to also\ndisrupt political parties."},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"And a lot of innovation\nwork is actually"},"705":{"dur":3,"text":"to talk pre-elections\nand post-elections"},"708":{"dur":6,"text":"with all parties, and give them\ntools to do better politics."},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"I think the second\nthing to keep in mind"},"717":{"dur":1,"text":"is that we talk\nabout innovation."},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"I actually don't know if\nthat's a very helpful term."},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"I agree with some of\nthe comments before."},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"When you put labs in,\none of the dangers"},"724":{"dur":1,"text":"is, here come the smart people."},"726":{"dur":1,"text":"You've been doing a lousy job."},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"And I see this from permanent\nsecretaries in Finland,"},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"the sheer fear in their eyes."},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"Because they're thinking about\nhow to manage an organisation"},"734":{"dur":1,"text":"and not actually\nbring tensions in."},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think the\nobjectives are right,"},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"but the terminology may\nactually be more loaded"},"741":{"dur":1,"text":"than we actually think."},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"Now I think the big\nchallenge is the way"},"745":{"dur":1,"text":"that the system's set up."},"746":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'll oversimplify\nthis, and I'm"},"749":{"dur":1,"text":"sure many will disagree with me."},"751":{"dur":1,"text":"But politicians\nare fundamentally"},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"about creating a vision\nabout a better tomorrow."},"755":{"dur":1,"text":"That's where tomorrow is."},"756":{"dur":1,"text":"And the public servants\nare basically there"},"758":{"dur":3,"text":"to bring the technical\nskills to get us there."},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"And that divide is what most\nof the innovation practises"},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"are challenging."},"767":{"dur":3,"text":"And when you co-create\nwith citizens,"},"771":{"dur":1,"text":"you're creating\npolitical movements,"},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"you're building ideological\nviews about the world."},"776":{"dur":3,"text":"You're technically\nsolving them, and you're"},"779":{"dur":1,"text":"kind of short-circuiting this."},"781":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think one needs to\nbe very aware of that."},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"This idea that we\nplan everything"},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"and then we implement it--\nwe're talking about prototyping"},"789":{"dur":1,"text":"and iterating\nquickly-- it gets us"},"791":{"dur":2,"text":"into even technical challenges,\nlike public procurement."},"794":{"dur":3,"text":"What happens when you\nhit 30,000K in Europe?"},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"Do you stop and\nbring a legal team"},"800":{"dur":2,"text":"and wait six months\nto do the big bid?"},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"Or do you start every little\nexperiment as potentially"},"804":{"dur":1,"text":"the next big solution\nthat will save humankind"},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"and procure it for\nbillions of euros?"},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's all kinds of issues\nthat really, fundamentally,"},"812":{"dur":1,"text":"we're challenging the system."},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think we need\nto make that realised."},"815":{"dur":3,"text":"I think because of the\nnature of central government"},"819":{"dur":1,"text":"and the difference\nbetween central government"},"821":{"dur":1,"text":"and municipalities, I\nthink municipalities"},"823":{"dur":2,"text":"tend to be more comfortable\nwith the world of innovation."},"825":{"dur":1,"text":"Because they have\nto not just deal"},"827":{"dur":1,"text":"with the regulatory\nenvironment, but they"},"829":{"dur":1,"text":"have to take the trash out."},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"They're more used\nto, maybe, doing"},"832":{"dur":1,"text":"the thinking and the doing."},"833":{"dur":4,"text":"And so I think we're seeing more\npolitical pull at that level."},"838":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think we have\na lot of barriers."},"840":{"dur":3,"text":"In Finland, at least,\nit's politically"},"843":{"dur":3,"text":"thought of not being sanitary\nto talk to public servants."},"847":{"dur":3,"text":"And there's a firewall\nbecause that should not"},"850":{"dur":2,"text":"be tainted by the beliefs\nof public servants."},"853":{"dur":1,"text":"In some places,\nlike city planning,"},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"that firewall is very big."},"857":{"dur":3,"text":"The same happens between central\ngovernment and municipalities."},"861":{"dur":1,"text":"Municipalities get\nvery irritated if we're"},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"going to try to connect\nsomething of policy"},"865":{"dur":2,"text":"all the way down to how\nyou take your trash out."},"867":{"dur":3,"text":"And yet that's where the\ninnovation is going to happen."},"870":{"dur":2,"text":"Couple of things I just\nwant to leave you with."},"873":{"dur":2,"text":"One is this notion that crisis\nis the mother of invention."},"875":{"dur":1,"text":"I think in Europe,\nwe're finding out"},"877":{"dur":3,"text":"that you actually are less\nsmart in front of a crisis,"},"880":{"dur":1,"text":"not smarter."},"881":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I think we need to\nhave the political aptitude"},"883":{"dur":3,"text":"to actually get politicians\nto react before crises hit,"},"887":{"dur":2,"text":"not wait for crises to happen."},"889":{"dur":3,"text":"I think we also need to\nshow what the process is."},"892":{"dur":3,"text":"So you can't assume to drop a\nteam in without that ecosystem"},"896":{"dur":2,"text":"having realised that things\nneed to happen differently."},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"In Finland, we worked\nwith the city of Lahti"},"901":{"dur":2,"text":"to work around master planning."},"904":{"dur":3,"text":"About 1,200 master plans

possible for you."},"1134":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll do the funding."},"1136":{"dur":3,"text":"This can be a great strategy\nuntil that person loses"},"1139":{"dur":3,"text":"power, drops dead, goes

strategy is kind of\nwhat we call the horse of Troy,"},"1155":{"dur":4,"text":"where we make it sound very\nsimple and not a threat at all."},"1159":{"dur":3,"text":"And we say, oh, it's just a\nvery

it"},"1169":{"dur":1,"text":"becomes really quite powerful."},"1170":{"dur":3,"text":"And suddenly the mayor\nor the chief executive"},"1174":{"dur":1,"text":"is like, oh my\ngod, did I actually"},"1176":{"dur":1,"text":"say yes to this project?"},"1177":{"dur":1,"text":"And now I have to deal with it."},"1179":{"dur":2,"text":"And so it becomes political."},"1182":{"dur":3,"text":"And the third strategy-- I'm not\nreally sure this is a feasible"},"1185":{"dur":1,"text":"one, but it's one\nthat's in my mind--"},"1187":{"dur":3,"text":"is that it's like perhaps\nstay away from political power"},"1191":{"dur":1,"text":"altogether."},"1192":{"dur":2,"text":"So one of the\nexperiences has been"},"1195":{"dur":3,"text":"that we've been

just went on\nwith these teachers."},"1206":{"dur":1,"text":"And now what\nhappened is actually"},"1208":{"dur":2,"text":"a whole movement started,\nand the teachers are saying,"},"1211":{"dur":2,"text":"we want to go on with this."},"1213":{"dur":3,"text":"And actually, now the\ngovernment is interested."},"1217":{"dur":2,"text":"But now you feel, if they\nare going

not"},"1229":{"dur":1,"text":"look for the political support."},"1231":{"dur":5,"text":"And just try to make it a\nmovement from down below."},"1236":{"dur":2,"text":"So these are the\nthree strategies."},"1238":{"dur":4,"text":"I don't know which is wise,\nbut we are trying out."},"1243":{"dur":4,"text":"And I do think that if we talk\nabout labs or innovation teams,"},"1248":{"dur":2,"text":"one thing to really\nthink in advance"},"1250":{"dur":2,"text":"is, how do you design\nthe political process?"},"1253":{"dur":4,"text":"So how do you design in

movement"},"1311":{"dur":2,"text":"and they're engaging\nwith citizens."},"1313":{"dur":2,"text":"And each of you says\nthat political power"},"1315":{"dur":4,"text":"is important at different\nstages

have a democracy"},"1367":{"dur":3,"text":"where people vote people\ninto positions of authority,"},"1371":{"dur":2,"text":"then I would suggest\nthat you do have"},"1373":{"dur":2,"text":"to work

make sure\nthat nobody has any discretion"},"2410":{"dur":1,"text":"to exercise."},"2411":{"dur":2,"text":"And then we complain about\nred tape in bureaucracy."},"2413":{"dur":1,"text":"So if I was going\nto wave a wand,"},"2415":{"dur":2,"text":"I would say we've got\nto rethink-- look,"},"2417":{"dur":2,"text":"we're making government the\nway we made it in the US"},"2419":{"dur":2,"text":"100
