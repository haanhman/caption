That's"},"47":{"dur":4,"text":"really helped me to settle in and just have a good time and just, like I say, get out and about."},"51":{"dur":4,"text":"But the reason for this video is that I've\nbeen tagged by the wonderful Emily Davison"},"56":{"dur":7,"text":"over at Fashioneyesta - hello! - who does\na lot of videos about disability, as well"},"63":{"dur":4,"text":"as beauty and fashion.

So yeah, I hope you find"},"129":{"dur":2,"text":"it interesting, and let's get on with the\nquestions."},"132":{"dur":3,"text":"What medical condition caused you to be blind\nor visually impaired?"},"136":{"dur":7,"text":"Well I have Aniridia and Nystagmus. I've done\nvideos on each of those, which I'll link to."},"143":{"dur":4,"text":"But in summary, Aniridia basically means I\ndon't have an iris in my eye. And the iris"},"148":{"dur":5,"text":"controls the size of the pupil, to determine\nhow much light comes in and out of my eye."},"154":{"dur":4,"text":"So when it's really dark, the pupil should\nexpand to let in as much light as possible,"},"158":{"dur":4,"text":"and when it's really bright, the pupil should\nshrink, so that less light comes in. But because"},"163":{"dur":5,"text":"it doesn't do that, I'm much more sensitive\nto glare, more so than other people would"},"169":{"dur":5,"text":"be, and I find it a bit trickier to adjust\nto seeing in the dark. I don't do too badly,"},"174":{"dur":2,"text":"but it is difficult sometimes."},"177":{"dur":5,"text":"And then Nystagmus basically means that my\neyes shake or wobble involuntarily all the"},"182":{"dur":7,"text":"time. I don't notice it - like Aniridia, I've\nalways had this, so my brain's adapted to"},"189":{"dur":5,"text":"it. But it does mean I can't read things at\na distance, because I can't get the focus"},"194":{"dur":4,"text":"on it for long enough, and I have to have\nthings close up to read them, and even then"},"199":{"dur":5,"text":"it can be a bit of a strain to read for very\nlong, because I've got to focus quite intently"},"205":{"dur":1,"text":"to read text for a while."},"207":{"dur":7,"text":"One of the adaptations that I use, on computers\nand on my phone, is that I invert the colours"},"214":{"dur":6,"text":"on the screen. So that means I have white\ntext on a black background, which is the opposite"},"221":{"dur":5,"text":"to what most people have. And that means I\ndon't get the glare off the screen, and it's"},"226":{"dur":5,"text":"really good contrast text for me, so that\nI can read it much more comfortably and easily,"},"231":{"dur":6,"text":"so I can read for a bit longer. So that really\nhelps a great deal, it makes a huge difference."},"238":{"dur":5,"text":"I've had both of those conditions since birth,\nso as far as I'm concerned my condition is"},"243":{"dur":5,"text":"normal, and my brain has adapted to them.\nI mean, I know my vision isn't normal, but"},"248":{"dur":4,"text":"I don't know what normal is like, so I don't\nfeel like I've lost anything, I don't feel"},"252":{"dur":4,"text":"that I'm missing anything, even though I know\nI am, if that makes sense. This just seems"},"257":{"dur":4,"text":"normal to me, this is everyday to me, so I\ndon't have a problem with it. I've always"},"262":{"dur":4,"text":"just lived with it and adapted to it, and\nit's not stopped me doing things I want to"},"266":{"dur":3,"text":"do. So yeah, I'm happy and comfortable."},"269":{"dur":2,"text":"Question 2 - In three words, describe your\nvision."},"272":{"dur":7,"text":"Well I would say short, light-sensitive. Because\nI am short-sighted. Although I can see things"},"279":{"dur":4,"text":"at a distance, I can't see the detail. So\nI can't read signs at a distance. So if I'm"},"284":{"dur":4,"text":"using the Tube or the buses, I'll use a little\ntelescope called a monocular that I can read"},"288":{"dur":6,"text":"things in the distance with. And then light-sensitive,\nas I've just said when explaining Aniridia,"},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm very sensitive to bright sunlight."},"298":{"dur":6,"text":"And even when the sun isn't directly out,\nit may be glaring off the clouds, or off buildings,"},"304":{"dur":4,"text":"or something like that, or off raindrops that\nhave recently fallen, I can be quite sensitive"},"309":{"dur":4,"text":"to that. Some days are better than others,\nbut when I'm having a particularly bad day,"},"314":{"dur":1,"text":"yes It can be quite irritating."},"315":{"dur":4,"text":"So I do wear sunglasses quite a lot. Even\nwhen it's cloudy, you'll see me wearing sunglasses"},"319":{"dur":7,"text":"sometimes. So, yeah... but like I say, it's\njust something I've got used to, the sunglasses"},"327":{"dur":4,"text":"really help, so that makes things easier when\nI'm outdoors, as does using the monocular."},"331":{"dur":3,"text":"So I've just found ways to adapt and get round\nthings as best I can."},"335":{"dur":4,"text":"Question 3 - What is the hardest thing to\ndo being blind or visually impaired?"},"340":{"dur":5,"text":"I would say meeting and interacting with other\npeople can be quite hard sometimes, especially"},"346":{"dur":3,"text":"regularly sighted people. Because obviously\nmeeting with people who are also visually"},"350":{"dur":9,"text":"impaired, they automatically understand you\nand they know how to interact with you. Interacting"},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"with normally sighted people can be hard when\nthey don't really know you to begin with."},"363":{"dur":5,"text":"You know, if you're going to meet someone\nsomewhere, they might say meet in a pub or"},"368":{"dur":4,"text":"something, and you're kind of looking around\ntrying to find them. And they might call out"},"372":{"dur":6,"text":"and wave to you, and you still haven't got\na clue where they are. Or trying to find someone"},"379":{"dur":5,"text":"in a crowd for instance, just trying to pick\nout a face is virtually impossible. Or even"},"384":{"dur":4,"text":"if someone just walks straight past me and\nsays hello, I won't see their face quickly"},"389":{"dur":3,"text":"enough to register who it was. So unless I\nhappen to recognise their voice, or they have"},"392":{"dur":5,"text":"something really distinctive about their appearance\nthat always makes me recognise them, sometimes"},"397":{"dur":5,"text":"I'll appear to blank people. So that can be\na bit awkward sometimes."},"403":{"dur":6,"text":"And then I can't always judge people's facial\nexpressions either. I don't always look people"},"409":{"dur":6,"text":"directly in the eyes, because I know if I\nwas to try and, like, force myself to look"},"415":{"dur":5,"text":"at someone in the eyes, it would be a strain,\nkind of, on the Nystagmus in my eyes and make"},"421":{"dur":4,"text":"that a bit worse. It's better to let my eyes\nkind of do whatever they're gonna do, rather"},"425":{"dur":5,"text":"than try and force them to stick in place,\nbecause I can't do that. So yeah, I tend to"},"431":{"dur":6,"text":"just make sure I'm facing in the person's\ndirection. And, like I say, I can't always"},"437":{"dur":4,"text":"judge their expressions or the looks in their\neyes to always accurately gauge how they're"},"441":{"dur":3,"text":"feeling. Usually there's other cues as well,\nbut occasionally you can't always tell."},"445":{"dur":7,"text":"And likewise even with me, because my eyes\ndon't look normal, sometimes people misinterpret"},"453":{"dur":4,"text":"how I'm feeling as well. You know, they might\nthink I'm upset or angry when I'm really not."},"457":{"dur":6,"text":"You know, something like that. It's just little things that people pick up on that they might misinterpret."},"464":{"dur":4,"text":"And then the other thing is that when I'm\nin a noisy environment, like a busy pub or"},"468":{"dur":4,"text":"something like that, sometimes it's hard to\npick out people's voices in amongst all the"},"473":{"dur":3,"text":"noise. You know, if there's a couple of people\nopposite me or next to me having a conversation,"},"476":{"dur":4,"text":"and I kind of want to listen in to chip in,\nit's a little bit hard sometimes if they're"},"481":{"dur":5,"text":"not talking to me directly, to pick up their\nvoices if there's lots of other extraneous"},"486":{"dur":6,"text":"noise, like music and other people shouting and talking away. So yeah, that can be quite difficult."},"493":{"dur":5,"text":"I know there is an associated condition with\nAniridia called Auditory Processing Disorder,"},"498":{"dur":5,"text":"which I think I might have an element of from\nwhat i've read about it, having edited a presentation"},"503":{"dur":5,"text":"about it for the Aniridia Network's channel.\nI mean, I don't know, I'm not a doctor, but"},"508":{"dur":4,"text":"it sounds like the sort of thing that I might\nhave some aspect of.

I"},"518":{"dur":4,"text":"think it's all part of the genetic defect\nI have that gave me Aniridia, I think it's"},"522":{"dur":5,"text":"kind of connected. So yeah, that can be quite\nhard. Noisy, busy environments can be quite"},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"difficult sometimes like that."},"531":{"dur":4,"text":"Question 4 - What's the best part about being\nblind or visually impaired?"},"536":{"dur":5,"text":"It does have its perks. I'd say discounted\nor free travel is quite a big perk, and not"},"541":{"dur":7,"text":"having to own a car. I don't have to pay insurance\nor for petrol or the MOTs on the car, and"},"549":{"dur":5,"text":"things like that. So that's a huge cost deduction\nin itself. Certainly here in London you don't"},"554":{"dur":5,"text":"drive if you can really help it I don't think.\nAnd then I have a Disabled Person's Railcard,"},"560":{"dur":6,"text":"so that gets me a third off. I had concessionary\nbus travel i.e. free bus travel where I came"},"566":{"dur":4,"text":"from, and I'm hoping to get the same here.\nWe're just kind of looking into that at the"},"571":{"dur":3,"text":"moment, signing up-with the local authority\nand all the rest of it. So hopefully I might"},"575":{"dur":4,"text":"be able to get a free Oyster card for free\ntravel. But we'll see."},"580":{"dur":7,"text":"But yeah, I like using public transport. The\nTube and the buses here are easy to use. Especially"},"587":{"dur":4,"text":"now you've got smartphone apps as well like\nCitymapper and Street View and things. I can"},"592":{"dur":5,"text":"plan my journey in advance really easily,\nso I know where I'm going before I get there,"},"597":{"dur":5,"text":"which is a lot easier than it ever used to\nbe in years gone by. So I think at the moment"},"603":{"dur":6,"text":"we live in a really good time where it's much\neasier to find your way around, as long as"},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"you get used to the apps and things that you\ncan get, and things like that. There's a lot"},"613":{"dur":8,"text":"of help out there. So yeah, I'd say free travel,\nor discounted travel, is very, very helpful,"},"622":{"dur":5,"text":"and definitely helps me to be more independent\nand confident. I like that a lot."},"627":{"dur":5,"text":"Question 5 - What question do you get asked\nabout or because of your vision?"},"632":{"dur":6,"text":"Do glasses help? That's the number one question\neverybody wants to ask, and often does ask."},"639":{"dur":6,"text":"I suppose it is a natural thing to wonder,\nbut then if you pause for a second and think"},"645":{"dur":5,"text":"about it, you know, if glasses helped, then\nI would be wearing them, it's as simple as"},"650":{"dur":5,"text":"that. I have tried various lenses in the past,\nthey haven't helped, and I've managed fine"},"656":{"dur":4,"text":"without them so far. You know, if it got to\na point where I did need glasses, I'd be prepared"},"660":{"dur":7,"text":"to wear them. But so far so good. Sunglasses\nare the only things I wear, but otherwise,"},"668":{"dur":6,"text":"yeah, I get by without glasses. It's just\nfine like that, you know."},"674":{"dur":4,"text":"And I know the question is well-intentioned,\nso I'm not knocking anyone who asks it. But"},"679":{"dur":5,"text":"if you ever feel like asking me that question,\nthe simple answer is no, glasses don't help,"},"684":{"dur":6,"text":"yes I have tried them. I don't feel I need them so, yeah, I don't need glasses at the moment."},"690":{"dur":3,"text":"Question 6 - Do you have a cane, a guide dog,\nor neither?"},"694":{"dur":5,"text":"Neither in my case. Like glasses, I don't\nfeel I need a cane or a guide dog either."},"699":{"dur":5,"text":"I've developed enough independence to get\naround by myself.

Again, if my sight were\nto get worse in the future, and it may well"},"716":{"dur":5,"text":"do - hopefully not for a long time if it's\ngonna happen at all, but if it does - then,"},"721":{"dur":4,"text":"yeah, I will consider the options as necessary.\nI'll consider a cane, I'll consider a guide"},"726":{"dur":5,"text":"dog, whatever is gonna be best for me. So,\nyeah, at the moment I don't need those things,"},"731":{"dur":4,"text":"but in the future I would be happy to consider\nthem accordingly if need be."},"736":{"dur":4,"text":"Question 7 - What piece of advice would you\ngive to someone who is going to lose, or is"},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"losing, or has completely lost their vision?"},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"It's not the end of the world, it won't stop\nyou living your life. I think that's the thing"},"748":{"dur":6,"text":"I would say. It will be a knock to your confidence,\nand it will take quite a bit of time and effort"},"754":{"dur":5,"text":"to adjust and adapt to how things are going.\nBut there is a lot of help and support out"},"760":{"dur":5,"text":"there now - make sure you get it, make sure\nyou have your family and friends around you,"},"765":{"dur":4,"text":"and just work at it bit by bit, and just adapt\nto it as best you can. Don't think about what"},"770":{"dur":3,"text":"you can't do, because there are a lot of things\nyou can do, you'd be surprised."},"773":{"dur":5,"text":"You know, there are a lot of things that,\njust by adapting how you do things and doing"},"779":{"dur":4,"text":"things differently, it is still possible to\ndo a lot of the things that you love and enjoy."},"784":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean there's a friend of mine, at the extreme\nlevel, who does extreme sports. But, you know,"},"788":{"dur":4,"text":"it can just be something simple like, I don't\nknow, learning an instrument or something,"},"792":{"dur":3,"text":"there's plenty of blind musicians out there.\nOr there's plenty of sports out there you"},"796":{"dur":3,"text":"can do. You know, visually impaired people\ncan still play tennis, they can still play"},"799":{"dur":6,"text":"goalball, they can still swimming and running,\nthings like that.

There are\nlots of things you can do. Research it, look"},"819":{"dur":4,"text":"into it, you'd be surprised. Especially with\nthe internet these days, you know, with all"},"823":{"dur":4,"text":"the social media and Google and everything\nelse, there's a lot of information out there."},"828":{"dur":6,"text":"So, yeah, don't think you can't do something.\nCheck it out first, you never know."},"834":{"dur":4,"text":"And then just take your time, do it bit by\nbit. It will take a while, it will be frustrating"},"839":{"dur":5,"text":"sometimes. But like I say, it's not the end\nof the world. If you just keep taking things"},"844":{"dur":5,"text":"step by step, day by day, you will grow in\nconfidence, you will grow in independence,"},"850":{"dur":5,"text":"and you will be fine. So just don't give up\non it if it seems to be taking a while. You"},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"will get there, it will be fine."},"858":{"dur":4,"text":"Question 8 - What one piece of advice would\nyou give to a sighted person who is interacting"},"862":{"dur":3,"text":"with someone who is blind or visually impaired?"},"866":{"dur":4,"text":"Don't make assumptions, don't make judgements.\nDon't think you know what that person is going"},"871":{"dur":5,"text":"through. because you don't.

Simple as that."},"944":{"dur":3,"text":"Question 9 - Why did you join Youtube?"},"947":{"dur":7,"text":"I joined as an experiment really, it was a\nbit of a whim in a way. I knew that, because"},"954":{"dur":6,"text":"I was coming up to London eventually, I knew\nI'd have to start making some connections"},"961":{"dur":4,"text":"and, you know, just seeking out resources\nand things like that.

That"},"1026":{"dur":4,"text":"wasn't the start of regular videos, it was\njust an experiment to see how that went."},"1031":{"dur":6,"text":"And then, a few months later, I decided to\nstart up a written blog, because I found it"},"1037":{"dur":5,"text":"more comfortable perhaps to start actually\nwriting things, where I can edit it properly"},"1042":{"dur":5,"text":"and really think about what I'm saying.
