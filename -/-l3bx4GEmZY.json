with"},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"the legs installed becomes a sub-assembly"},"293":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's much easier\nto move things around."},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"So in order to do that we've\ngot

down."},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"That works okay, the\nproblem that I found though"},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"is the oils that are\nin there seem to leave"},"344":{"dur":2,"text":"a pattern on the workpiece which to me"},"346":{"dur":1,"text":"is worse than what we had before"},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"so what I do is a very\ninexpensive solution"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"I actually just use bubble wrap."},"354":{"dur":2,"text":"It cushions the workpiece,\nit holds it in place,"},"356":{"dur":1,"text":"and you could put as much pressure,"},"358":{"dur":1,"text":"as little pressure as you

later."},"399":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay, and then I'll take a paper towel"},"401":{"dur":5,"text":"and I will carefully\nwipe off that extra glue."},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"And as soon as we start\nthis the pressure is on."},"413":{"dur":3,"text":"This gets full coverage\non the entire side."},"423":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll attach the first side."},"437":{"dur":1,"text":"I could use my parallel clamps

use"},"450":{"dur":4,"text":"an F-Style clamp like this because it's"},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"a very small, single point of pressure."},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"I found that it works a\nlot better on these curves."},"469":{"dur":4,"text":"And this is where those\ndowels, biscuits, dominos,"},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"whatever you use this is where they're"},"475":{"dur":3,"text":"gonna come in handy

inside"},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"of this cabinet at this stage of the game."},"493":{"dur":4,"text":"And for the most part\nit is nice and flush."},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"Now the key for getting\nthis cabinet glued up"},"499":{"dur":1,"text":"and nice and square and even"},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"is to make sure that those side panels"},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"are equally distant from\nthe bottom of the legs"},"506":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's what I use my square for."},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"I had already glued up\none of the sub-assemblies"},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"took a measurement made sure both sides"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"were even so both legs\nwere even on that one piece"},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"and then locked that\nmeasurement into my square"},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's what I'm\nusing here to make sure"},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"that this one is perfect as well."},"521":{"dur":1,"text":"So when it's all said and done"},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"there may be some unevenness"},"523":{"dur":1,"text":"that we have to contend with"},"525":{"dur":1,"text":"and we'll deal with that\nwhen the time comes,"},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"but at least now we've\nstacked the cards in our favor"},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"that this cabinet is going to be as square"},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"and all 4 legs are going to hit the ground"},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"at the same point, if we're lucky."},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"Now the other thing I'll point out"},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"is the glue squeeze out."},"537":{"dur":1,"text":"We do not want to let that dry completely."},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"If you do when you chip that stuff away"},"541":{"dur":1,"text":"it's gonna pull wood fibres with it"},"543":{"dur":1,"text":"which is just going to make a mess."},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"It's going to be terrible."},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"So I usually give it\nabout 20 minutes to set."},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"By that time it skins\nover and then we can use"},"551":{"dur":3,"text":"a chisel or a scraper\nto scrape away the glue"},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"and maybe especially if you have"},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"the scraper in your hand\ngive it another scape or 2"},"559":{"dur":1,"text":"just to make sure you\nclear any of the film"},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"that's on the surface\nand then it shouldn't be"},"563":{"dur":1,"text":"a problem for us later on"},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"when it comes time to finish."},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"Now I've jumped ahead just a little bit"},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"and we've got a dry assembly going."},"569":{"dur":1,"text":"You could see the shelves\nhave already been cut"},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"and they're in place."},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"It's just 1\/2 inch bubinga stock"},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"that's been milled down"},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"to the proper width and length"},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"to fit perfectly between the two

earlier,"},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"the little skinny strips are going to be"},"590":{"dur":1,"text":"basically cut in half."},"591":{"dur":1,"text":"A little bit of extra\nmaterial removed from"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"the center and they\nwill go into the rabbit"},"596":{"dur":1,"text":"and all the way into\nthe groove on the side"},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"and sort of lock in place."},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"And then this end is going to be held into"},"602":{"dur":1,"text":"that rabbit with a Rare-earth magnet."},"604":{"dur":1,"text":"And this way just by\nfinger you could go in"},"606":{"dur":3,"text":"and pull the little strip out\nof the way, run your wires."},"609":{"dur":1,"text":"There are some details there that"},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"I haven't worked out just yet,"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"but that's really the jist\nof where this is going."},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"Now in addition to\ndrilling for the magnets"},"617":{"dur":1,"text":"which we'll do in a few minutes"},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"I have to make sure that the top edge"},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"of each one of these strips is dead flat"},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"so that I can glue it\nto the surface above it."},"625":{"dur":1,"text":"That's gonna give the shelves a little bit"},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"more support and keep\nthem more stable over time"},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"and kind of just really\ngive the whole structure"},"631":{"dur":1,"text":"that much more support"},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"and as I look through I\ncould see that there is"},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"a little bit of gap action here and there"},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"so really I guess these things were milled"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"probably about a week\nago so there could be"},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"a little bit of movement there"},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"and normally I would just take them"},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"right over to the jointer,\ngive them a quick pass"},"646":{"dur":1,"text":"flatten them out and call it a day."},"648":{"dur":3,"text":"The problem is this is figured maple"},"651":{"dur":1,"text":"and heavily figured maple has"},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"a tendency to tear out\nwhich means everytime"},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"it hits one of those\nbeautiful little grain pockets"},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"its gonna pull out some material"},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's actually gonna\nwind up looking worse"},"663":{"dur":1,"text":"than it does right now"},"664":{"dur":2,"text":"so the only thing I can\nthink to do is to use"},"667":{"dur":4,"text":"a hand tool so let's\nget our Neanderthal on."},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"Now today we haven't used\na whole lot of hand tools"},"674":{"dur":1,"text":"on this show just because the work"},"676":{"dur":1,"text":"hasn't really called for it."},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"You've seen me use my\nsaws and my block planes"},"680":{"dur":1,"text":"and chisels and things like that,"},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"but we haven't gotten\nmuch into the hand planes"},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"so let me just quickly\nshow you what this guy is."},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"This is a No. 7 jointer plane."},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"As you can see it's got a huge base on it."},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, that's 22 inches from front to back."},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"The concept and the\nway it gets its name is"},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"because it's meant for joining boards"},"698":{"dur":3,"text":"and this way with a huge sole like this"},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"you're able to get a\ngood reference surface."},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"If you think of what\nour power jointer does"},"705":{"dur":1,"text":"turn this upside down and you kind of see"},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"the concept a nice long bed on either side"},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"and you could run the\nboard across the blade"},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"so the more referenced\nsurface that you have"},"714":{"dur":1,"text":"the truer it's going to be."},"716":{"dur":1,"text":"If you take something like a block plane"},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"and go across the surface\nyou can flatten it out"},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"to some extent, but you got to be careful"},"722":{"dur":1,"text":"because if there's a dip in the middle,"},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"you know, that might be\n5 or 6 inches in length"},"727":{"dur":3,"text":"this could very well follow that dip."},"730":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not really gonna take"},"731":{"dur":1,"text":"the high and the low spots out."},"733":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay, so the great thing about this tool"},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"especially on a very\nsmall workpiece like this"},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"it really does all the work for you."},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"Now the idea here is to keep"},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"the sole flat on the workpiece"},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"and there's so much meat\nbehind the blade here"},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"that the plane could very\neasily tilt backwards"},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"so it's important to keep\nthe pressure at the front"},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"so that it stays registered perfectly."},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"And really the goal here is to balance it."},"756":{"dur":1,"text":"We're on a thin workpiece"},"757":{"dur":1,"text":"and I could gang them up together"},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"and do 2 at once, but I'm\njust gonna do 1 at a time."},"762":{"dur":1,"text":"A 1\/2 inch is enough to work with"},"763":{"dur":1,"text":"so I'm gonna very carefully make sure that"},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"the front stays down and\nthe plane stays balanced"},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"on the workpiece and then really"},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"the weight of the plane"},"772":{"dur":2,"text":"is gonna do most of the work for us."},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"And just a couple of strokes\nis all it's gonna take."},"789":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's it."},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, full length shaving\nfrom one side to the other"},"804":{"dur":2,"text":"means you are done."},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"Use a nice straightedge."},"813":{"dur":1,"text":"And as soon as you get to the point that"},"814":{"dur":1,"text":"you can't see any light peeking through"},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"you know you got it."},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"Now with the drill press with\nthe 1\/2-inch Forstner Bit"},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"I can create the holes that we need"},"823":{"dur":2,"text":"to put our magnets in here, okay,"},"825":{"dur":3,"text":"1\/2-inch fits perfectly just like that."},"839":{"dur":1,"text":"Now I'm gonna use a high quality epoxy"},"841":{"dur":2,"text":"to glue the magnets into the little holes"},"844":{"dur":1,"text":"that we just created."},"845":{"dur":2,"text":"Now epoxy is really the best

gonna be pretty airtight"},"909":{"dur":2,"text":"so you're gonna have to force that down."},"925":{"dur":1,"text":"Now as the epoxy sets its a good idea"},"926":{"dur":1,"text":"to put some pressure on there if you can."},"928":{"dur":1,"text":"There could be some air\nbubbles stuck in there"},"930":{"dur":1,"text":"so it's good to have a constant, you know,"},"932":{"dur":1,"text":"force pulling down on it"},"933":{"dur":1,"text":"and the easiest way to do that"},"935":{"dur":1,"text":"is just to get your other magnet"},"936":{"dur":2,"text":"put it on the back
