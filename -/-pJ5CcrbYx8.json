{"0":{"dur":1,"text":"- Hi again folks, this is Chris Hargreaves"},"2":{"dur":3,"text":"from AModernProfessional.com\nand welcome, to this episode."},"5":{"dur":3,"text":"In the first episode I gave\nyou a bit of an overview"},"8":{"dur":2,"text":"about what kind of things we\nwere going to be talking about"},"11":{"dur":4,"text":"in this show and now I\nwant to focus on something"},"15":{"dur":3,"text":"that is close to my heart and\nI'm going to try and do it"},"18":{"dur":3,"text":"without ranting too much\nabout it but it is this."},"21":{"dur":2,"text":"Why are lawyers not seeing results"},"25":{"dur":4,"text":"in their digital marketing\nspace, why is it?"},"29":{"dur":2,"text":"There are a lot of lawyers\nwho now have websites,"},"32":{"dur":2,"text":"they probably have a Facebook page,"},"34":{"dur":1,"text":"and might have a couple\nof social media accounts"},"36":{"dur":2,"text":"here and there and yet,\nthe consistent story"},"39":{"dur":2,"text":"that I hear is that most\nlawyers are not seeing"},"42":{"dur":3,"text":"that many results from their\ndigital marketing efforts."},"45":{"dur":1,"text":"So, what are we going to do about that?"},"47":{"dur":1,"text":"The first thing we're going to do"},"48":{"dur":1,"text":"is identify why that might be happening"},"50":{"dur":4,"text":"and in future episodes we're\ngoing to build up a strategy"},"54":{"dur":2,"text":"that you can start to\nadopt in your own practise,"},"57":{"dur":1,"text":"where you will start to see results."},"58":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, the first thing I\nwant to be clear about"},"61":{"dur":3,"text":"is that, as I mentioned\nin the earlier episode,"},"64":{"dur":1,"text":"this is a long-term strategy."},"66":{"dur":2,"text":"Digital marketing and\nreally any form of marketing"},"68":{"dur":4,"text":"and relationship development\nis a long-term strategy."},"73":{"dur":3,"text":"It may be that you implement\na sophisticated digital"},"76":{"dur":3,"text":"marketing programme and\nyou see success very early,"},"79":{"dur":2,"text":"but it may not be that as well,"},"82":{"dur":2,"text":"and partly that will\ncome down to the effort"},"85":{"dur":1,"text":"you're putting in but\npartly it will come down"},"87":{"dur":2,"text":"to whether you're doing it\ncorrectly, or not correctly."},"89":{"dur":2,"text":"It is in fact possible\nto do the wrong thing"},"92":{"dur":2,"text":"and that might not\nnecessarily kill your efforts"},"94":{"dur":1,"text":"in digital marketing but it\nmight mean that you don't see"},"96":{"dur":2,"text":"results for a much longer time."},"99":{"dur":2,"text":"So obviously, we want to see\nresults as fast as we can"},"101":{"dur":2,"text":"but we need to be realistic\nand accept the fact"},"104":{"dur":3,"text":"that you need to be patient,\nyou need to work hard"},"108":{"dur":1,"text":"and you need to be patient."},"109":{"dur":2,"text":"That is no different to\nany offline marketing"},"112":{"dur":1,"text":"and relationship development strategy"},"114":{"dur":1,"text":"that you're going to see,"},"115":{"dur":2,"text":"patience and hard work,\nit's very important."},"118":{"dur":2,"text":"So the second thing, before\nI get into identifying"},"121":{"dur":2,"text":"these factors that see\nlaw firms and lawyers fail"},"123":{"dur":2,"text":"in their digital marketing,\nis to have a look"},"126":{"dur":2,"text":"at what digital marketing\nactually includes."},"128":{"dur":2,"text":"For many it's going to\ninclude a few things,"},"130":{"dur":1,"text":"and I explain these in the\nfirst episode so I'm not going"},"132":{"dur":3,"text":"to get too much into these\nbut it's going to include"},"136":{"dur":3,"text":"any activities that you\nare engaging in online,"},"141":{"dur":3,"text":"which are designed to\nattract people to you,"},"147":{"dur":1,"text":"to get them to trust you"},"148":{"dur":3,"text":"and to have you get business\nfrom them in some way."},"152":{"dur":3,"text":"I think it's important that\nwe have that end goal in mind."},"155":{"dur":3,"text":"It is designed to help you get a profit,"},"158":{"dur":1,"text":"it's designed to help you get work."},"160":{"dur":1,"text":"You need to build clients,"},"161":{"dur":1,"text":"you need to have people\nreferring you work,"},"162":{"dur":2,"text":"because that's what your\npractise is founded upon,"},"165":{"dur":1,"text":"you need to actually have work to do."},"166":{"dur":3,"text":"That should be obvious and in\nthat sense it's no different"},"170":{"dur":3,"text":"to any other online or\noffline marketing strategy,"},"173":{"dur":2,"text":"it is designed to get people to do work,"},"175":{"dur":1,"text":"but it is in the online space,"},"177":{"dur":2,"text":"so we're talking about\ndigital things here."},"179":{"dur":1,"text":"So ordinarily, what's it going to be?"},"181":{"dur":2,"text":"It's going to be things you do\non your website or don't do,"},"183":{"dur":1,"text":"it's going to be how\nyou design your website,"},"185":{"dur":1,"text":"it's going to be what you put on"},"187":{"dur":1,"text":"your website in terms of content."},"189":{"dur":1,"text":"It's going to involve social media,"},"191":{"dur":2,"text":"lawyers and social media\nare a horrendous mix"},"194":{"dur":4,"text":"but lawyers and social media\nneed to become better friends"},"199":{"dur":2,"text":"because, if you're going to implement"},"202":{"dur":1,"text":"a digital marketing strategy"},"203":{"dur":3,"text":"it is necessarily going to\nhave a social component."},"207":{"dur":3,"text":"It might involve, also, an\nemail marketing strategy,"},"210":{"dur":2,"text":"if you have a good website strategy set up"},"213":{"dur":2,"text":"then you should be capturing\nemail addresses from people"},"215":{"dur":2,"text":"who are interested in what you have to say"},"218":{"dur":2,"text":"and that is really then\ngiving you permission"},"220":{"dur":4,"text":"to add value to them to\nbuild that reservoir of trust"},"224":{"dur":3,"text":"so that you can eventually\nask them for the work"},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"or also eventually that they\nwill trust you enough to send"},"231":{"dur":3,"text":"you either their own work or\nrefer other people to you."},"234":{"dur":1,"text":"So that is what we're talking about"},"236":{"dur":2,"text":"and the question for today"},"238":{"dur":4,"text":"is why are lawyers not\nseeing results in that space."},"244":{"dur":3,"text":"I've got three big picture items\nthat I wanted to touch upon"},"247":{"dur":2,"text":"and I could talk about\nall of these for hours,"},"249":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to try and avoid that"},"251":{"dur":1,"text":"because I know you've got things to do."},"253":{"dur":4,"text":"Let's start with the first,\nand the first is this,"},"258":{"dur":4,"text":"most lawyers have no\ndigital marketing strategy."},"263":{"dur":0,"text":"What do I mean?"},"264":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean they haven't sat\ndown and actually documented"},"268":{"dur":3,"text":"a strategy about what they\nare going to do online,"},"271":{"dur":1,"text":"why they are going to do it"},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"and how the things they are going to do"},"275":{"dur":1,"text":"are connected to the ultimate goal"},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"of becoming liked, known and trusted"},"279":{"dur":3,"text":"to a target client audience\nor referral audience,"},"282":{"dur":3,"text":"to drive profitable\naction by those people."},"286":{"dur":1,"text":"Have you ever thought\nabout it in that space?"},"288":{"dur":1,"text":"I suspect you haven't."},"289":{"dur":2,"text":"What we find most lawyers and law firms do"},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"in terms of their\ndigital strategy is this,"},"294":{"dur":4,"text":"they spend a huge amount of\nmoney on a custom built website,"},"299":{"dur":2,"text":"now there is problem number one."},"301":{"dur":1,"text":"Firstly, they spend huge\namounts of money on it,"},"303":{"dur":2,"text":"you do not need to spend a\nhuge amount of money on it,"},"305":{"dur":3,"text":"I've seen custom built websites\nthat are no better than"},"309":{"dur":4,"text":"the $500 website you can get\nfrom the smaller operation."},"313":{"dur":3,"text":"So, we overspend on that\nside of things and what we"},"317":{"dur":4,"text":"underspend on, is deciding what\nour website is actually for."},"321":{"dur":4,"text":"Go to any big law firm's\nwebsite, go to their homepage"},"325":{"dur":1,"text":"and ask yourself this question."},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"What does this law firm want me to do"},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"when I get to their homepage."},"333":{"dur":3,"text":"And my guess is, you'll\nhave no idea for many."},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"You might find a good one but\nthe vast majority have no clue"},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"what they want you to do when\nyou get to their homepage,"},"344":{"dur":2,"text":"they have gone for information dump,"},"346":{"dur":1,"text":"and so normally what you will find,"},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"is you will find some nice pithy quotes"},"350":{"dur":1,"text":"that may or not be attributed to anyone"},"352":{"dur":1,"text":"and you will find a million links"},"353":{"dur":2,"text":"to practise areas, to people, to searches,"},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"to contacts, to publications\nand various other things,"},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's because they haven't decided"},"360":{"dur":3,"text":"what they want you to do,\nthey have no strategy,"},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"they obviously want you to hire them,"},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"but how are they funnelling you"},"368":{"dur":3,"text":"into a process designed\nto get you to that point"},"371":{"dur":4,"text":"where you're actually prepared\nto hire them as your lawyers?"},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"What they're hoping you will\ndo, is of course click around,"},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"read about their stuff,\nread some of their articles,"},"382":{"dur":3,"text":"sign up to one of their\nnewsletters, but that's hope,"},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"it's not designed in a good\nway to get you to that position"},"388":{"dur":3,"text":"so they haven't strategized\ntheir website design."},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"Now that gets compounded then, with this,"},"394":{"dur":1,"text":"random acts of content."},"398":{"dur":3,"text":"Most law firms produce\nhuge amounts of content,"},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't need to convince any\nlawyer that producing content"},"404":{"dur":2,"text":"is something that we should\nbe doing but they produce"},"407":{"dur":4,"text":"content without any kind\nof strategy behind it,"},"411":{"dur":2,"text":"they're engaged in random acts of content"},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"and usually they get their\nprofessional staff to write"},"416":{"dur":3,"text":"their content, there is no\ninstruction about a strategy,"},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"if there is a strategy\nit's usually not shared"},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"with the lawyers who are\nactually writing the articles"},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"or the law clerks writing the articles."},"426":{"dur":4,"text":"Most law firms adopt a quick,\nlet's do an update strategy"},"430":{"dur":1,"text":"and I've got to tell you,"},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"that's actually not a\nstrategy of any kind."},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"Waiting for something to happen"},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"and then rushing out an update\non it is not a strategy,"},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"it's not something that you should avoid,"},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm not against writing\nupdates, I think they can be"},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"very useful if something\ncomplicated has happened"},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"and you want to add value\nto a particular audience,"},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"then writing an update on it is great"},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"but that is not a strategy."},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"A strategy needs to work"},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"even if something external doesn't happen"},"457":{"dur":1,"text":"and so most people have not developed"},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"a content marketing strategy,\ninstead what they've done is"},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"they have just gone quick,\nwe need to write an article,"},"465":{"dur":3,"text":"random acts of content and\nwhether it's an article,"},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"a video or podcast, it\ndoesn't really matter,"},"470":{"dur":3,"text":"there is no strategy\nbehind it, there is no arc,"},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"they don't know what\ntheir customer journey is,"},"476":{"dur":1,"text":"they don't know what their\nclients are looking for,"},"478":{"dur":1,"text":"what questions they're actually asking,"},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"and they don't know how\nto get people from A to B,"},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"from this point of I've\nonly just heard of you,"},"485":{"dur":1,"text":"what have you got for me,"},"486":{"dur":3,"text":"to wow, that information\nyou gave me was amazing."},"489":{"dur":3,"text":"Now if they are lucky enough\nto actually have someone"},"492":{"dur":3,"text":"on an email list, then what\nthen is the email strategy?"},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"This person has given you\na very valuable asset,"},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"they have given you their email address,"},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"and permission to communicate with them,"},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"what are you doing with that?"},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'll tell you again, most\nlaw firms and most lawyers"},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"have no strategy to deal\nwith that situation."},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"What you get is updates,"},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"and that comes right back to\nwhat I just said about content."},"518":{"dur":4,"text":"If I am a new person just\nsigned up to your newsletter"},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"and I know very little about you,"},"525":{"dur":4,"text":"why would you not send\nme six or 12 or 18 emails"},"531":{"dur":3,"text":"over the next six to nine to 12 months,"},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"gently introducing me to the topic"},"538":{"dur":3,"text":"that I expressed interest\nin, not other topics,"},"542":{"dur":1,"text":"if I expressed interest in insolvency,"},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"then I don't want you to send\nme updates about family law,"},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"I might, but I haven't\nexpressed interest in that,"},"549":{"dur":3,"text":"you've got to hone in on these\npeople and you've got to say,"},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"where are they at now, and\nwhere do they want to be"},"556":{"dur":1,"text":"and how can I help them get there?"},"558":{"dur":1,"text":"That would be an email marketing strategy,"},"559":{"dur":1,"text":"but instead all they get is updates,"},"561":{"dur":2,"text":"and so they sign up and\nthen sometime later,"},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"it's not usually clear, because\nof course, you've got no"},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"strategy, you've got to wait\nfor the update to happen,"},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"they'll get an email with\nhere's our latest newsletter,"},"571":{"dur":3,"text":"with 637 things in it,\nplease read them all"},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"and then call us for further information."},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"That's not a strategy,\nso no email strategy."},"582":{"dur":4,"text":"And then, of course, there's\nno social media strategy."},"586":{"dur":3,"text":"Law firms are notoriously\nterrible at social media"},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"and lawyers are not far behind."},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"Individual lawyers, there are\nsome who are actually seeing"},"595":{"dur":1,"text":"significant results on social media,"},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"I know you may find that hard to believe,"},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"depending on where you're\npositioned at at the moment"},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"and what you think about all of this"},"602":{"dur":1,"text":"in terms of digital marketing,"},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"but what there is, is a\nfundamental misunderstanding,"},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"still, about what social media is for."},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"We line through the social\nand we just focus on the media"},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"and so social media, for most law firms,"},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"has become a publication platform only"},"618":{"dur":4,"text":"rather than an amazing\nopportunity for engagement"},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"and so I'm going to get\nto social media strategy"},"625":{"dur":4,"text":"as part of these episodes,\nbut if you have no strategy"},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"behind your social media use,"},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"that dovetails in with your email strategy"},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"and dovetails in with\nyour content strategy"},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"and dovetails in with\nyour website strategy,"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"then you just haven't\nthought through the process."},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"And so my challenge to you,"},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"for this big ticket item number one,"},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"which is that lawyers have no strategy"},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"for their digital marketing, is this,"},"651":{"dur":3,"text":"have you actually documented a strategy"},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"that goes across all of\nthose subject matters"},"658":{"dur":4,"text":"I've spoken about and\nif so, are you using it?"},"662":{"dur":3,"text":"I am not a fan of strategies\nthat take two days,"},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"you know, you go out to\nthis expensive resort,"},"667":{"dur":3,"text":"you have a big dinner,\nsupposedly you're generating"},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"your strategy for the next\nyear, lots of talk happens,"},"674":{"dur":1,"text":"something might get written down"},"675":{"dur":3,"text":"and then it gets put in\na drawer and put away."},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"When I say you need a\nstrategy, what I mean is"},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"you need a strategy that\nyou actually refer to"},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"and that you constantly utilise,"},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"everything needs to refer\nback to your strategy."},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"Your strategy cannot go in a drawer"},"691":{"dur":1,"text":"and stay there for 12\nmonths, you dig it out,"},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"dust it off and then go ah,\nI didn't do any of that,"},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"gee I wish I'd remembered\nI had that document,"},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"that's not a strategy, that's\njust wasting your time."},"699":{"dur":1,"text":"If you're going to generate a strategy,"},"701":{"dur":3,"text":"it needs to be something\nyou're prepared to actually do"},"705":{"dur":3,"text":"and refer to and refine,\nsometimes your strategy"},"708":{"dur":1,"text":"might not work and you need to change it"},"710":{"dur":3,"text":"but you need to give it time\nto develop as well and refine."},"714":{"dur":1,"text":"So, no strategy."},"718":{"dur":3,"text":"Big ticket item number two\nas to why most lawyers aren't"},"722":{"dur":4,"text":"seeing digital marketing and\ncontent marketing results,"},"726":{"dur":4,"text":"is they haven't refined\nthemselves, their practise areas,"},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"their target clients or their content."},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"What am I talking about?"},"737":{"dur":3,"text":"You might identify that\nyou have a strategy,"},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"you want to generate\nan article every month,"},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"or something like that\nbut you need to refine"},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"what it is you're doing\nand you need to refine"},"747":{"dur":3,"text":"everything down to a fair\namount of particulars."},"751":{"dur":4,"text":"The first thing you need to\nrefine is what you actually do"},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"and how you're going to position yourself."},"758":{"dur":1,"text":"Positioning yourself in the market"},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"is critically important for\nany kind of digital marketing"},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"because if you come out\nto me and you tell me"},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"that you are the country's greatest expert"},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"in personal injuries,\ninsurance, insolvency, taxation,"},"772":{"dur":4,"text":"hospitality, property, business\nsales, transactional work"},"776":{"dur":3,"text":"and town planning, then\nI don't believe you."},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"It is very difficult for\nyou to position yourself"},"784":{"dur":1,"text":"as an expert in all of those areas"},"785":{"dur":3,"text":"because I just don't believe\nthat someone would be an expert"},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"in all of those things and in particular,"},"791":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't believe that you\nare telling me the truth"},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"and it erodes your trust\nif you're going to claim"},"796":{"dur":1,"text":"to be an expert in all of those areas."},"798":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, you might be an expert\nin all of those areas,"},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"you might have 40 years'\nexperience and you might be able"},"803":{"dur":1,"text":"to do all of those things very, very well"},"805":{"dur":4,"text":"but in terms of positioning,\nhow are you going to refine"},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"any other message if you're not 100% clear"},"812":{"dur":1,"text":"on exactly what you want to be doing?"},"814":{"dur":1,"text":"And the two biggest questions here,"},"815":{"dur":3,"text":"are what are you most passionate about"},"819":{"dur":2,"text":"and what kinds of people\ncan you help the most?"},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"That's a good way to start"},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"if you're having trouble with this."},"827":{"dur":1,"text":"Now most lawyers are\nafraid that they're going"},"828":{"dur":1,"text":"to scare people off,\nand I want to tell you"},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"that you need to be prepared\nto scare people off,"},"832":{"dur":3,"text":"or at the very least\nyou need to be prepared"},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"to repel the people who you're not,"},"839":{"dur":2,"text":"necessarily, that interested in capturing."},"841":{"dur":1,"text":"It doesn't mean you don't\ndo that work anymore,"},"843":{"dur":1,"text":"perhaps you should say\nno to some kinds of work,"},"845":{"dur":2,"text":"perhaps you should eliminate\nsome practise areas"},"848":{"dur":2,"text":"so you can genuinely refine your practise,"},"851":{"dur":2,"text":"but I'm not saying you must do that,"},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm saying it's worthwhile thinking about,"},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"but in terms of positioning,\nyou need to refine what you do."},"858":{"dur":3,"text":"You then need to refine who you do it for."},"861":{"dur":4,"text":"If you can't describe your\nclient or your desired client"},"866":{"dur":2,"text":"in a fair amount of\ndetail, what do they like,"},"869":{"dur":2,"text":"what do they read about,\nwhat are they interested in,"},"871":{"dur":2,"text":"then you can't develop a\ncontent marketing strategy"},"873":{"dur":3,"text":"because you don't know enough about them."},"876":{"dur":2,"text":"So you need to refine your client"},"879":{"dur":1,"text":"and we'll get into more\ndetail about that later."},"880":{"dur":2,"text":"You also need to then refine your content,"},"883":{"dur":2,"text":"you need to have a journey\nthat you are taking"},"885":{"dur":2,"text":"your prospective client on\nso that you can help them"},"888":{"dur":2,"text":"get from A to B, and I\nmentioned this before,"},"891":{"dur":2,"text":"the best way to have a\ncontent marketing strategy"},"893":{"dur":2,"text":"is to look at where is the person now,"},"896":{"dur":3,"text":"and where am I wanting\nto help them get to,"},"899":{"dur":1,"text":"and it might be knowledge,\nit might be an understanding"},"901":{"dur":3,"text":"of a process, it might\nbe how to do x, y and z,"},"904":{"dur":2,"text":"it might be how best to\nutilise legal services,"},"906":{"dur":3,"text":"whatever it is, how can you\nhelp them get from A to B"},"910":{"dur":2,"text":"and then fill in the\nblanks, one step at a time,"},"913":{"dur":1,"text":"each step is a piece of content"},"914":{"dur":2,"text":"and that content can then be helpful,"},"917":{"dur":1,"text":"that is a content marketing strategy"},"919":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's how you refine\nit but you can't refine it"},"920":{"dur":3,"text":"until you know what it is\nyou're positioned to do"},"924":{"dur":1,"text":"and who it is you're doing it for"},"926":{"dur":2,"text":"because you don't know then\nwhere to engage with people"},"929":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's where refining\nyour social media"},"930":{"dur":2,"text":"comes in as well, if you\ncan't refine your clients"},"933":{"dur":1,"text":"and you don't know what they do"},"934":{"dur":1,"text":"and you're not sure what you stand for"},"936":{"dur":1,"text":"and how you help people,\nthen you can't engage"},"938":{"dur":1,"text":"with people on social media."},"940":{"dur":2,"text":"And so you need to refine\nyour

them,"},"948":{"dur":2,"text":"you can start developing\nrelationships with them"},"950":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's how social media works as well."},"953":{"dur":3,"text":"So number two is a lack of refinement."},"956":{"dur":2,"text":"The third and final thing\nI wanted to touch on,"},"959":{"dur":4,"text":"in this particular episode,\nis a lack of empowerment"},"964":{"dur":3,"text":"and principally this deals\nwith firms that have more staff"},"967":{"dur":1,"text":"so if you're a solo practitioner"},"969":{"dur":1,"text":"then this might apply to you slightly less"},"971":{"dur":3,"text":"but I genuinely believe\nthat the first large firm,"},"975":{"dur":4,"text":"say 50 or more lawyers, who\nactually empowers their staff,"},"980":{"dur":3,"text":"trains their staff, gives their\nstaff the necessary tools,"},"984":{"dur":3,"text":"the necessary autonomy\nand the necessary freedom"},"988":{"dur":3,"text":"to embark on their own\npersonal branding exercise,"},"992":{"dur":3,"text":"they will win and they will win so quickly"},"995":{"dur":3,"text":"but most law firms are still\nobsessed with their own brand,"},"999":{"dur":2,"text":"they don't

reality,"},"1046":{"dur":2,"text":"most firms do the exact opposite."},"1049":{"dur":1,"text":"They put the barriers up,"},"1050":{"dur":2,"text":"rather than taking the barriers down,"},"1053":{"dur":2,"text":"they don't train their staff\nproperly in those areas"},"1055":{"dur":2,"text":"and they certainly don't\nempower their staff."},"1057":{"dur":1,"text":"What they do is

there is risk there,"},"1088":{"dur":2,"text":"I know someone might go\nout and do something stupid"},"1091":{"dur":2,"text":"but the fact is, if you're not\nprepared to take that risk,"},"1094":{"dur":2,"text":"then you shouldn't be letting that person"},"1097":{"dur":2,"text":"have a telephone call with\nanyone, you shouldn't be letting"},"1099":{"dur":3,"text":"that person ever go out\nto coffee unsupervised,"},"1102":{"dur":2,"text":"you shouldn't be letting\nthat person go to lunch,"},"1105":{"dur":2,"text":"so why would you put up\nbarriers in the digital

you?"},"1116":{"dur":3,"text":"Why are you so much more\nterrified of online strategy"},"1119":{"dur":2,"text":"than you are of offline strategy?"},"1122":{"dur":3,"text":"Because almost no firm would\nstop a young, aspiring lawyer"},"1125":{"dur":2,"text":"from going out to coffee\nwith a contact of theirs"},"1127":{"dur":2,"text":"but they absolutely would stop that
