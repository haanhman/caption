I actually started working at\nChez Panisse the first year it was opened"},"100":{"dur":7,"text":"in 1971, which was forty years ago. The restaurant\njust celebrated it's 40th Anniversary. And"},"108":{"dur":7,"text":"at the time I was an intern at the print shop\nof poster artist Davis Lance Goines in Berkeley"},"116":{"dur":4,"text":"and that's how I come to know the people,\nAlice, and the people at Chez Panisse and"},"121":{"dur":7,"text":"ended up working there in the dining room.\nAnd so for a time I worked at the day time"},"128":{"dur":6,"text":"at the print shop and in the evenings at the\nrestaurant. And then I got very sort of swept"},"135":{"dur":5,"text":"up, and very interested in all that was going\non at the restaurant. The incredible food"},"140":{"dur":5,"text":"and the energy there, what was going on and\nI sort of started spending less time at the"},"145":{"dur":5,"text":"print shop and morning then in the pastry\nkitchen and then in the other kitchens and"},"151":{"dur":5,"text":"eventually ended up spending up most of my\ntime in the kitchen and cooking. Which was"},"156":{"dur":7,"text":"a great, wonderful, adventure. And after a\ntime I ended up then starting a family and"},"168":{"dur":6,"text":"wanted to change that and so I stopped cooking.\nAnd about that time Alice started getting"},"174":{"dur":5,"text":"contracts to doing cookbooks and we worked\non the first drawing. And then I just sort"},"180":{"dur":7,"text":"of flipped over from cooking and went back\nto printing and design and cookbooks but still"},"188":{"dur":6,"text":"working with Chez Panisse and still working\nwith Alice.

And, uh,"},"279":{"dur":4,"text":"before we get into me really showing you those\nmenus I want to tell you a little bit about"},"283":{"dur":6,"text":"the process of how they are made. There are\nletter press menus and I have a beautiful"},"290":{"dur":7,"text":"old cast iron letter press that is called\nthe Chandler and Price, C and P, and it is"},"298":{"dur":7,"text":"a, it has a clam shell action that sort of\nopens and closes like this. And the paper"},"309":{"dur":7,"text":"is fed into the press by hand, it sits on\nthe area called the platen, it's a flat area"},"316":{"dur":6,"text":"of metal and that's the part that closes and\nmeets with the block or the type or whatever"},"322":{"dur":7,"text":"is being printed. You can see the block there\nvertically. It's a one color press, prints"},"330":{"dur":7,"text":"one color of ink at a time. That's the ink\nplate and the rollers are spreading the ink"},"338":{"dur":6,"text":"on the ink plate and the ink plate slowly\nturns with each cycle of the press and will"},"345":{"dur":4,"text":"distribute that ink evenly. Then it comes\ndown and rolls over the surface of the block"},"349":{"dur":6,"text":"and the press closes and prints and paper\ncomes out and new paper comes in. And [clears"},"356":{"dur":5,"text":"throat] it was built, and this press is about\none hundred and twenty years old, still as"},"361":{"dur":7,"text":"solid as the day it was made. It was mainly\nbuilt to print type, metal type, hand-set"},"370":{"dur":7,"text":"and this is a sample of a little bit of type\nsetting. Um, and that's a process that is"},"378":{"dur":7,"text":"pretty much outdated now, purists still do\nit but it's putting the type together letter"},"385":{"dur":7,"text":"by letter, space by space, space between the\nlines, very, very laborious and handmade."},"392":{"dur":7,"text":"But recently, the last twenty years or so,\nthe advent of polymer plate technology has"},"400":{"dur":6,"text":"really regenerated and revitalized letter\npress printing. And that is still the same"},"406":{"dur":7,"text":"principle of relief printing, printing from\na raised service-like type. But this material"},"413":{"dur":7,"text":"is a thin layer of metal and on that is another\nlayer of polymer material that has a photo"},"421":{"dur":7,"text":"ground coating on the top, and to make the\nplate digital type setting or some other form"},"430":{"dur":7,"text":"of image that can be output as a negative.\nThe negative and the polymer plate are sandwiched"},"438":{"dur":5,"text":"together, it's exposed to light and where\nthe light hits the photo ground on the polymer"},"444":{"dur":6,"text":"surface it hardens. And then the polymer plate\nis washed in warm water, it's a great thing"},"450":{"dur":6,"text":"because there is no toxic photo chemicals,\nit's a pretty benign process. And then the"},"456":{"dur":5,"text":"softer polymer material just rinses away and\nyou are left with that relief surface, so"},"462":{"dur":7,"text":"it's a very wonderful, easy technology that\nmeans you don't have to set type and put the"},"470":{"dur":7,"text":"type all back in the box. So it then locks\nup in the press, it sits on a magnetic base"},"480":{"dur":5,"text":"so that thin layer of metal on the back sits\non a magnetic base and then those two things"},"485":{"dur":7,"text":"together, the base and the plate equal a measurement\nthat is type high, which is the universal"},"492":{"dur":5,"text":"height of type, metal type. And so that means\nanything you can make a plate out of you can"},"497":{"dur":4,"text":"lock that up in the press and print from it.\nSo a lot of small letter press shops have"},"502":{"dur":5,"text":"come up because you don't have to have all\nthe equipment and all the type and all of"},"507":{"dur":5,"text":"that, you just need a press and access to\na plate maker and it's done something pretty"},"512":{"dur":5,"text":"wonderful.\nBut how I make images primarily is linoleum"},"517":{"dur":7,"text":"block and similar to the polymer material,\nlinoleum block is a thin layer of linoleum"},"526":{"dur":5,"text":"mounted on wood and it's approximate type\nhigh. I usually have to build up the back"},"531":{"dur":6,"text":"of it. And linoleum is a natural material,\nthis kind is called battleship linoleum. It's"},"538":{"dur":5,"text":"created out of powered cork and linseed oil,\nit was developed by the military just before"},"543":{"dur":6,"text":"World War II to use as flooring for their\nbattleships and submarines. And which, you"},"549":{"dur":5,"text":"know, it's impervious to water and it's soft\nenough to stand on so your legs don't get"},"555":{"dur":7,"text":"tired and it has a sort of a little porous\nsurface. It's not flat like metal or polymer"},"563":{"dur":6,"text":"and so when it's printed it has a sort of\nstippled texture that I find really beautiful"},"569":{"dur":6,"text":"and you can really identify linoleum from\nthat look once you know what it is. And the"},"576":{"dur":7,"text":"process of making them, the prints, the blocks\nthemselves, is I start with a drawing and"},"584":{"dur":6,"text":"then, a pretty simple drawing like this as\nyou can see. And then you have to, I use drafting"},"590":{"dur":6,"text":"paper, turn it over and trace it on the back\nbecause when you are working in printing you"},"597":{"dur":6,"text":"have to work in reverse. And then I put a\nsort of graphite crayon on the back and taped"},"603":{"dur":5,"text":"that onto the block and then trace through\nthe drawing onto the block and that leaves"},"608":{"dur":4,"text":"something that looks like a pencil line on\nthe block. And I do that for, one block for"},"613":{"dur":6,"text":"each color in the print, cause press prints\none color at a time. And so if the image has"},"620":{"dur":7,"text":"four colors then there are four blocks and\nthen once that drawing has been transferred"},"627":{"dur":7,"text":"to the linoleum then it's cut and carved and\nthat's a process of removing all the negative"},"635":{"dur":7,"text":"space in the print. So as you can see with\nthis leaf the block on the bottom, you can"},"643":{"dur":7,"text":"see the lines of the gouges where the linoleum\nhas been removed so that only that part that"},"651":{"dur":7,"text":"I want to print is there. Here's an example\nof this violet image, the image is made from"},"660":{"dur":7,"text":"four blocks and the first one on the left\nis the dark green leaves of the image so that"},"670":{"dur":6,"text":"was printed first. And then the second block\nis of the area under the leaves, just the"},"676":{"dur":5,"text":"solid, and that's a lighter green so that's\ncoming through the lines that are cut in the"},"682":{"dur":6,"text":"first image, the veins and inside the stalks\nthere. The third one is another line image"},"689":{"dur":6,"text":"of these, sort of outlines and interior lines\nof the violets and then the last one is the"},"695":{"dur":5,"text":"tint, the purple tint color of the violets.\nSo those are printed one at a time. There"},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"is also a little bit of an orange that you\nwill see in the image that is the center of"},"704":{"dur":5,"text":"the flowers that I just added by water color,\nit's a little hard to cut those tiny little"},"710":{"dur":6,"text":"spaces and get them in the right place. So\nthat's the basic process , here's the finished"},"716":{"dur":7,"text":"menu that that was made for, a New Years Eve\nmenu. So usually when I am making these menus"},"725":{"dur":5,"text":"that have text I will print the image first\nand the last thing that happens is the type"},"730":{"dur":7,"text":"is added at the end, a separate run. So, as\nI say, the organization of the book is the"},"739":{"dur":6,"text":"menus are chronological and the first ones\nthat I made early on were really typographical."},"745":{"dur":6,"text":"I didn't know how to do this linoleum work\nat that time, so I was setting this by hand,"},"752":{"dur":7,"text":"and metal type and using little type ornaments\nand that sort of thing. And another aspect"},"759":{"dur":5,"text":"that is sort of fun about this book is reading\nwhat's actually on the menus. There, it's"},"765":{"dur":6,"text":"kind of a snapshot of the history of Chez\nPanisse as well and really what was being"},"771":{"dur":7,"text":"served when and in this case for how much.\nIt's pretty astonishing, homemade pastries"},"778":{"dur":5,"text":"for seventy five cents. Lindsay Shere , who\nwas the pastry chef, the starting pastry chef"},"784":{"dur":4,"text":"at the restaurant, made fantastic, fantastic\ndesserts and you could just go in and get"},"789":{"dur":7,"text":"wonderful little cappuccino or a cup of coffee\nand a slice of her almond tart and pay one"},"796":{"dur":7,"text":"dollar which is pretty amazing. When the restaurant\nfirst opened with their four course meal,"},"804":{"dur":4,"text":"and they just became famous, I don't know\nif you know about Chez Panisse but they became"},"808":{"dur":6,"text":"famous for serving one prix fixe dinner menu\na night. So it was either four or sometimes"},"815":{"dur":3,"text":"on weekends it would be five courses, but\nwhen they first started it was four dollars"},"819":{"dur":5,"text":"and fifty cents for a four course dinner in\n1971. Of course they were losing a lot of"},"825":{"dur":5,"text":"money so [audience laughs] after about six\nmonths I think it went up to six fifty or"},"830":{"dur":7,"text":"six twenty five or something like that. But\nnow it's far from that. So I didn't really"},"838":{"dur":5,"text":"start making too many menus until after I\nstopped cooking. I would dabble in it a little"},"844":{"dur":6,"text":"bit and I did acquire a press during that\ntime but I didn't really have time, I was"},"851":{"dur":4,"text":"too busy in the kitchen. But then afterwards\nwhen I started working on the books and I"},"856":{"dur":7,"text":"wanted to print more and I wanted to add images\nto the type and so I decided I maybe I would"},"863":{"dur":6,"text":"try to do learn to do this linoleum work.\nSo this is one of the first blocks I cut,"},"870":{"dur":7,"text":"a single color and it's really pretty simple.\nBut I was thrilled by it and I thought maybe"},"878":{"dur":7,"text":"I can do this. And the other way that I was\nmaking menus at the time, was in collaboration"},"888":{"dur":6,"text":"with my husband, Stephen Thomas, who is a\nprint maker and prints etchings and Intaglio"},"894":{"dur":5,"text":"printer. And so we would collaborate and I\nwould do a drawing on a copper plate that"},"899":{"dur":7,"text":"he would etch or something else and then combine\nit with type and so these are etchings. And"},"908":{"dur":4,"text":"when we were doing these, because it's a really\ntime consuming process printing etchings,"},"912":{"dur":6,"text":"so it was usually a small number for maybe\nthat particular party, one table of four or"},"918":{"dur":7,"text":"six or eight or something. Very small number.\nThis menu on the left, the menu for the potato"},"926":{"dur":7,"text":"king was for a friend of ours who had an absolute\nobsession with potatoes and he always wanted"},"935":{"dur":5,"text":"potatoes with every meal. It wasn't a meal\nunless there was some kind of a potato dish."},"941":{"dur":7,"text":"So for his birthday we made him a menu that\nhad potatoes with every course and put together"},"948":{"dur":5,"text":"quickly just this little menu in a couple\nof days and Stephen printed it. The other"},"954":{"dur":6,"text":"was for a dinner for James Beard who didn't\noften come to the restaurant but he came this"},"960":{"dur":5,"text":"one spring and it was a time we were just\nharvesting green garlic, the young garlic"},"966":{"dur":3,"text":"that you only get right in the spring. At\nthe time that was a really new thing, now"},"970":{"dur":4,"text":"you see it in all the farmers markets but\nthat was kind of a big deal to have this young"},"974":{"dur":7,"text":"green garlic so that's what decorated the\nmenu. And Stephen and I did a number of New"},"981":{"dur":7,"text":"Years menus together for a few years in a\nrow and we liked to focus on the celestial"},"991":{"dur":7,"text":"theme, sort of the big picture. And took some\ninspiration from some photographs, NASA photographs"},"999":{"dur":7,"text":"that were coming back of the Earth from space\nfor this one. Here's another etching, its"},"1007":{"dur":7,"text":"a mezzotint actually and this was an astronomical\noccurrence of a blue moon, the second full"},"1017":{"dur":5,"text":"moon within on calendar month. And it was\nthat night of the New Years Eve dinner so"},"1023":{"dur":7,"text":"we couldn't resist that. But then I started\nworking on this linoleum thing and I tried"},"1032":{"dur":7,"text":"to get better at it doing, getting a little\nmore ambitious and the images start out very"},"1041":{"dur":6,"text":"simple. These are sort of just shapes with\na little line work in them. And often the"},"1048":{"dur":6,"text":"imagery that I would do is, I was working\nat the limitations of what I could manage"},"1054":{"dur":6,"text":"so they had to be simple. But sometimes they\nwere inspired by literally something on the"},"1060":{"dur":7,"text":"menu that was an ingredient or something being\nserved. Or often times it would be something"},"1069":{"dur":7,"text":"that represented the season or the time or\nthe moment. This one is kind of both. And"},"1078":{"dur":5,"text":"here is another sample of the kind of menu\nI would do sometimes and often times if there"},"1084":{"dur":5,"text":"was somebody special coming in, there was\ntwo days notice that Elizabeth David or Richard"},"1089":{"dur":7,"text":"Olney or Julia Child or someone was coming\nand Alice really wanted a special menu. So,"},"1097":{"dur":5,"text":"in those cases, I would do something very\nfast, just set the text in type and print"},"1103":{"dur":7,"text":"that and then do hand decorations. A little\ndrawing and in this case a water color filling"},"1110":{"dur":7,"text":"in, for just that small group of people, that\ntable of four or that table of six. This was"},"1122":{"dur":7,"text":"a special lunch for Richard Olney again, he\nis no longer with us but he was very influential"},"1130":{"dur":7,"text":"cookbook writer, an American, an ex-pat who\nlived in France for most of his life and wrote"},"1138":{"dur":7,"text":"about French food and wrote for an American\naudience. He wrote about the Cuisine du Bonne"},"1148":{"dur":7,"text":"Femmes, which is just the ordinary wonderfully\nhousehold cooking of French homemakers. And"},"1159":{"dur":7,"text":"he elevated that and really broke it down\nreally fantastic books. So here, this was"},"1166":{"dur":5,"text":"an important breakthrough for me, this particular\nmenu because the imagery is really simple"},"1172":{"dur":7,"text":"but I drew it from life. Hadn't been doing\nthat and I got these leaves and I wanted to"},"1181":{"dur":7,"text":"somehow get this color and so I drew the leaves\nand figured out this composition and then"},"1190":{"dur":5,"text":"I had this kind of light bulb go off and thought\nwell maybe on my press that has this ink plate"},"1195":{"dur":4,"text":"that turns around and spreads the ink, maybe\nI could disconnect that. I disconnected the"},"1200":{"dur":6,"text":"device that turned the ink plate and then\nmixed different colors and just spread them"},"1207":{"dur":5,"text":"on the ink plate by hand and then just let\nthe rollers blend them a little bit so that"},"1212":{"dur":6,"text":"if you picture this menu turned on its side\nso that the block is ninety degrees you can"},"1218":{"dur":7,"text":"see stripes of color; red, yellow, orange\nand then more yellow. And so with one pass"},"1226":{"dur":5,"text":"through the press, all these different colors\non the ink plate, it was like, wow this could"},"1231":{"dur":5,"text":"work. And it's a little rough, you can see\nwhere those lines aren't there and they are"},"1237":{"dur":7,"text":"not blending perfectly, but it was really\nan exciting moment and I thought this, this"},"1244":{"dur":7,"text":"could really lead to something. I could play\nwith this. So then I decided I need to get"},"1253":{"dur":6,"text":"better at this drawing thing and I have always\nbeen very influenced by both typographically"},"1260":{"dur":7,"text":"and with images and visually by older books.\nAnd I really, really loved old botanics and"},"1269":{"dur":7,"text":"herbals. This is an image from John Gerarde's\nHerbal printed in 1633 which was the height"},"1278":{"dur":5,"text":"of a scientific text at the time of identifying\nplants and what their properties were and,"},"1284":{"dur":6,"text":"um, huge, big book. And these are wood cuts,\nso single color cut from wood, same process"},"1290":{"dur":6,"text":"as linoleum only wood instead of linoleum.\nSo I used to pore over these and look at these"},"1297":{"dur":5,"text":"and think, try and figure out how to do it.\nMaybe I could do something like that or I"},"1302":{"dur":7,"text":"would do very simplified versions of them.\nAnd so I started trying to do that sort of"},"1309":{"dur":7,"text":"thing of this, like the garlic, bunch of garlic\nhere. Which again I was starting to draw from"},"1317":{"dur":6,"text":"life because that's what I wanted to see on\nthe menus. I couldn't find something directly"},"1323":{"dur":5,"text":"to sort of immolate or copy so I was just\ntrying to use the style but trying to do that."},"1329":{"dur":7,"text":"And like this, you can see the direct influence\nof those Herbal wood cuts. But I wanted also"},"1339":{"dur":5,"text":"to add color to them so then I would do the\nline work in black and then cut a block and"},"1344":{"dur":5,"text":"add the screen, to get a tint. The purple\nin that turnip is a little handwork that was"},"1350":{"dur":7,"text":"put on with water color. The other source\nof imagery that I really, really loved is"},"1360":{"dur":7,"text":"Japanese woodblock prints and that whole tradition.\nThis print was made by Utamoro in a book called"},"1370":{"dur":6,"text":"Song of the Garden that combined his images\nwith the text of Japanese poets, very popular"},"1377":{"dur":7,"text":"book at the time It was printed in 1788. And\nI loved the composition of these are so lyrical"},"1387":{"dur":7,"text":"and beautiful where, and the combination of\nthe text with the image and the space in there."},"1395":{"dur":6,"text":"And I was also looking at like these leaves\nwhich had the line and the color and so graceful"},"1401":{"dur":7,"text":"and trying to think how can I sort of incorporate\nthat in that too. So I started immolating"},"1408":{"dur":7,"text":"that and here is an image made about that\ntime. This was actually a card that folded"},"1416":{"dur":7,"text":"in the middle, so it had a front and a back,\nbut really conceived of as one image in that"},"1423":{"dur":7,"text":"Japanese woodblock style. [pause] Here's another\nvery simple bu, for me, kind of markers of"},"1438":{"dur":4,"text":"the time because I was breaking these into\ndifferent colors and being able to put them"},"1442":{"dur":7,"text":"together and without necessarily the black\nline, but composing an image of these separate"},"1450":{"dur":7,"text":"blocks just with color. And then using the\nspace like the beautiful spaces in those Japanese"},"1458":{"dur":7,"text":"prints. And this is not anything literal about\nthe menu, this is flowering quince. But again"},"1467":{"dur":7,"text":"it's about the season, about just a moment,\nhere's where we are right now. Another homage"},"1476":{"dur":7,"text":"to Japan with the fade at the top. One of\nthe things that has always been very interesting"},"1484":{"dur":7,"text":"in the studio and satisfying is to keep pushing\nthe limits of the medium and keep pushing"},"1492":{"dur":6,"text":"the limits of the press itself. What can I\ndo of this particular machine with these particular"},"1498":{"dur":7,"text":"materials? And how one discovery leads to\nanother and the emphasis to try something"},"1505":{"dur":7,"text":"new. So I had been making some of these special\nmenus for the downstairs restaurant and Alice"},"1516":{"dur":6,"text":"really wanted to have something every night\nin there. Which was very difficult to accomplish,"},"1523":{"dur":4,"text":"especially with the changing menu every night,\nand then it was always right until the last"},"1528":{"dur":7,"text":"hour really that that menu was getting determined.\nSo I worked out a system where using an 8-1\/2"},"1536":{"dur":7,"text":"x 11 sheet I could print on one half of it\nand then they could set the menu for the evening's"},"1546":{"dur":6,"text":"dinner on the computer, output that and then\nput these in the copy machine and photocopy"},"1552":{"dur":5,"text":"that onto the interior and then fold it and\nthen there would be this combination of up"},"1558":{"dur":7,"text":"to date menu but something pretty and printed.\nSo I started making these as seasonal imagery"},"1566":{"dur":6,"text":"and printed them for about a year and a half\nor so, you know like two or three thousand"},"1573":{"dur":7,"text":"at a go. But which was just not sustainable\nat all so eventually I designed something"},"1581":{"dur":6,"text":"that could be printed offset and they could\nprint multiple thousands and that would do"},"1588":{"dur":7,"text":"for awhile. [pause]\nNowadays they still use that same system and"},"1598":{"dur":5,"text":"they reproduce images from illustrations I\nmade for some of the cookbooks of fruit and"},"1603":{"dur":7,"text":"vegetable illustrations. So about the time,\nabout the time this menu was made I was working"},"1613":{"dur":6,"text":"on a book called Chez Panisse Vegetables where\nI really, this is where the sort of drawing"},"1620":{"dur":7,"text":"really had to get better. And my task was\nto very specifically draw certain vegetables,"},"1629":{"dur":6,"text":"fifty different ones and made prints of these.\nAnd so I really started drawing from life,"},"1635":{"dur":7,"text":"going to the garden or brining material into\nmy studio and I didn't have, that was so consuming"},"1644":{"dur":3,"text":"I couldn't really spend too much time making\nthe menu. So some of the images I made for"},"1648":{"dur":5,"text":"that I incorporated and just said \"I can do\na menu if it's got this on it.\" But these"},"1653":{"dur":7,"text":"are images that were made for that book actually.\nBut I found that just by doing it more and"},"1663":{"dur":7,"text":"doing more and doing it more I did get better\nat it.
