like."},"1654":{"dur":0,"text":"NAOMI TURE: Yeah."},"1655":{"dur":1,"text":"So I think we\nmentioned this before."},"1657":{"dur":3,"text":"But it's really kind of the\nultimate filmmaking

cinematographers."},"1693":{"dur":2,"text":"And the rest are just support."},"1695":{"dur":3,"text":"And so logistically,\nthe way we do it"},"1698":{"dur":3,"text":"is actually Alfred\nHitchcock style."},"1702":{"dur":3,"text":"So we want the\nexperience for the viewer"},"1705":{"dur":4,"text":"to feel as though it's a\nconstant-- we're filming"},"1710":{"dur":4,"text":"from when they go to

go."},"1725":{"dur":4,"text":"So because we're filming\nevery single possible minute,"},"1730":{"dur":2,"text":"and no camera in the world\ncan film for 24 hours."},"1732":{"dur":2,"text":"There's no card."},"1734":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, actually there\nare ways to do that."},"1738":{"dur":2,"text":"But what we needed was, you\nneed at least two cameras"},"1741":{"dur":1,"text":"and at least two\ncamera operators."},"1742":{"dur":3,"text":"So you're constantly signaling\nto the other camera operator"},"1745":{"dur":1,"text":"and switching cameras."},"1747":{"dur":6,"text":"And in order to kind of\ntransition to the next thing,"},"1753":{"dur":2,"text":"you'll move the camera\nto maybe a black space"},"1756":{"dur":1,"text":"while the next person\nbegins filming."},"1758":{"dur":1,"text":"like showers and bathrooms?"},"1760":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, these people are\nliving an actual life."},"1761":{"dur":2,"text":"So doing things they probably\ndon't

our\nparticipant a day"},"1868":{"dur":1,"text":"before we were about to film."},"1869":{"dur":4,"text":"So we had motorbiked across the\nwhole city of Ho Chi Minh
