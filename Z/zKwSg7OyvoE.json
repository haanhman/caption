labor."},"622":{"dur":3,"text":"Now the very important\naspect about this"},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"is that this is a society\nwhich does not yet"},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"have full plants and\nanimal

plants and animals, but\nthat hasn't yet occurred here"},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"at around 9,000 BC."},"644":{"dur":3,"text":"So these are basically\nhunter-gatherer

needed."},"657":{"dur":5,"text":"And that seems somehow to then\ngenerate occupation around it."},"663":{"dur":5,"text":"So here is a photograph of these\ncircular stone

temples, the\nequivalents of those things,"},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"become rectangular."},"689":{"dur":4,"text":"So the sequence that\none can reconstruct here"},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"is that people originally\ncome together, perhaps"},"696":{"dur":3,"text":"from a very large landscape,\nthey come together in order"},"699":{"dur":3,"text":"to construct these monuments,\nthese rituals, circles"},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"themselves, and then\ngradually people"},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"live and live there longer\nand longer until you"},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"have a settlement that\ngrows up around them."},"710":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is very much saying\nthat at a very early date,"},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"hunter-gatherers\nare coming together"},"715":{"dur":4,"text":"to create

on the site."},"760":{"dur":3,"text":"If we look at the\nstones themselves,"},"763":{"dur":4,"text":"it's been argued that they\nrepresent people in some way."},"767":{"dur":3,"text":"That they're representations\nof mythical people or ancestors"},"771":{"dur":1,"text":"in some way."},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"And you can see that they've\ngot the arms coming down"},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"on the

and this"},"784":{"dur":4,"text":"is a loin cloth at the front."},"788":{"dur":3,"text":"And as I said before,\nthe T shape at the top"},"792":{"dur":3,"text":"suggests to many people that\nthese are

exactly how\nto interpret that."},"850":{"dur":2,"text":"But on the whole, the\nimagery is very male."},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"And I don't know if you can\nsee from where you're sitting,"},"856":{"dur":4,"text":"but most of the wild animals\nhave the male genitalia"},"860":{"dur":2,"text":"clearly shown."},"862":{"dur":2,"text":"A lot of the imagery\nis associated"},"865":{"dur":3,"text":"with violence in various ways."},"868":{"dur":2,"text":"Here's another one of\nthese T-shaped pillars"},"871":{"dur":6,"text":"with a wild boar and this sort\nof

stone."},"925":{"dur":2,"text":"Again, you see the\nt-shaped generally."},"928":{"dur":2,"text":"Just one point to make is\nthat I'm talking about these"},"930":{"dur":1,"text":"as if it's all one phase."},"932":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact, the [INAUDIBLE] is\nmuch more complex than that."},"935":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can see how\nthis pillar here"},"937":{"dur":2,"text":"has had this wall

sort"},"974":{"dur":3,"text":"of birds here that\nlook vaguely humanoid,"},"978":{"dur":3,"text":"and there's some sort of human\nbird mixing going on here."},"982":{"dur":4,"text":"And this bird here seems\nto be doing something"},"986":{"dur":3,"text":"with a spherical object."},"990":{"dur":2,"text":"Perhaps playing with\na ball or something."},"992":{"dur":5,"text":"And then down here, you have\nthis bird with, on its back,"},"998":{"dur":4,"text":"is a human with an erect\npenis and without a head."},"1003":{"dur":3,"text":"And we'll talk later about\nsort of

here."},"1048":{"dur":5,"text":"And it's a larger version of a\nseries of sites that gradually"},"1054":{"dur":4,"text":"emerged that are shown\nby these T-shaped symbols"},"1059":{"dur":2,"text":"in

focus"},"1090":{"dur":4,"text":"on these important ritual\nbuildings and centers."},"1094":{"dur":6,"text":"And what's fascinating is that\nrecent genetic work on wheat"},"1101":{"dur":3,"text":"has

how do you explain that?"},"2394":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, the way we\nexplain it, and there"},"2396":{"dur":2,"text":"are ethnographic\nparallels for this,"},"2398":{"dur":2,"text":"is that soon after\nbirth, children"},"2401":{"dur":2,"text":"are distributed\naround the settlement."},"2404":{"dur":2,"text":"So you don't grow up with\nyour mother and father,"},"2406":{"dur":2,"text":"your genetic mother and father."},"2408":{"dur":3,"text":"You grow up with other\nmembers of the community"},"2412":{"dur":2,"text":"in other buildings,\nin other houses."},"2414":{"dur":4,"text":"So cross-cutting all\nof this, cross-cutting"},"2419":{"dur":3,"text":"the groups of people who bury\nand have all these symbols,"},"2423":{"dur":2,"text":"you also have all the\ngenetic cross-cutting things,"},"2426":{"dur":1,"text":"where people are\nlinked to each other"},"2428":{"dur":6,"text":"through their genetic histories."},"2434":{"dur":5,"text":"In a way, the whole of\nCatalhoyuk, because of this way"},"2439":{"dur":2,"text":"children are treated,\nthe whole of Catalhoyuk"},"2441":{"dur":4,"text":"is one family that's\nall tied together."},"2445":{"dur":4,"text":"And so this is a very,\nvery dense network."},"2449":{"dur":3,"text":"It means that any\nindividual house"},"2453":{"dur":4,"text":"can call on lots and lots of\ndifferent types of relationship"},"2457":{"dur":2,"text":"if they run out of food,\nor if they have a bad year,"},"2459":{"dur":2,"text":"or if they have\ndifficulties in some sort."},"2461":{"dur":4,"text":"So why do people come\ntogether at Catalhoyuk?"},"2466":{"dur":2,"text":"In my view, they\nmainly come together,"},"2468":{"dur":1,"text":"not only at this\nsite, at other sites,"},"2470":{"dur":3,"text":"because they can link\ninto these very, very"},"2473":{"dur":3,"text":"dense, complex networks\nthat supports them"},"2476":{"dur":5,"text":"when there are times of\nhardship, or they need support."},"2481":{"dur":3,"text":"By coming together,\none can become involved"},"2485":{"dur":1,"text":"in this very dense network."},"2487":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's this dense\nnetwork, and the sets"},"2489":{"dur":4,"text":"of beliefs that go along with\nit, that create the conformity,"},"2494":{"dur":6,"text":"and that create the\nset of social rules"},"2500":{"dur":3,"text":"that organize and run\nthe society as a whole."},"2506":{"dur":4,"text":"I just want to add another\nway in which this happens."},"2511":{"dur":4,"text":"So at Catalhoyuk,\nwhen you were buried,"},"2516":{"dur":4,"text":"you sometimes had your head\nremoved after a period of time."},"2520":{"dur":5,"text":"So maybe a year later, somebody\nwent down and took off the head"},"2526":{"dur":5,"text":"from that individual, and then\nreburied the bones and so on."},"2531":{"dur":2,"text":"So the head was taken out."},"2533":{"dur":5,"text":"And these heads, we know, were\nkept for a long period of time."},"2538":{"dur":3,"text":"So they were often painted."},"2542":{"dur":3,"text":"Sometimes, the facial\nfeatures were plastered back"},"2545":{"dur":1,"text":"onto the skull."},"2549":{"dur":2,"text":"They were circulated for\na long period of time."},"2552":{"dur":3,"text":"And then ultimately, they were\ndeposited in various ways."},"2555":{"dur":3,"text":"Sometimes they were deposited\nat the base of the posts that"},"2558":{"dur":1,"text":"hold up the house."},"2560":{"dur":2,"text":"So the ancestor, if you\nlike, was holding up a house."},"2563":{"dur":2,"text":"In this particular case,\nthere's a plastered skull here."},"2566":{"dur":1,"text":"You can't probably\nsee it very well,"},"2567":{"dur":2,"text":"but there's skull in\nhere with the nose"},"2569":{"dur":3,"text":"and the facial\nfeatures plastered on,"},"2572":{"dur":3,"text":"and this is a reconstruction\nhere, the plastered face."},"2576":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is a woman's skull."},"2578":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is a woman."},"2581":{"dur":6,"text":"So this skull was kept in\nsociety for quite a long period"},"2588":{"dur":2,"text":"of time before being\ndeposited with this woman when"},"2590":{"dur":2,"text":"she was buried."},"2593":{"dur":5,"text":"So if you came to Catalhoyuk, as\nyou moved around the site, you"},"2598":{"dur":2,"text":"what you would find\nin the Neolithic"},"2601":{"dur":2,"text":"that there were body\nparts, human body parts,"},"2603":{"dur":2,"text":"that were being circulated\nin the community as a whole."},"2606":{"dur":1,"text":"These are mainly\nskulls, but we also"},"2608":{"dur":2,"text":"have evidence that arms and\nlegs and other parts of the body"},"2610":{"dur":1,"text":"were kept and circulated."},"2612":{"dur":4,"text":"So again, you see how\nthis creates a network."},"2616":{"dur":2,"text":"All the people who are\nassociated with the skull, who"},"2619":{"dur":3,"text":"are related to the skull, all\nthe people who were related"},"2622":{"dur":2,"text":"to the individual from\nwhom the skull was obtained"},"2624":{"dur":2,"text":"and so on, again it\ncreates is very, very sort"},"2627":{"dur":4,"text":"of dense network of people."},"2631":{"dur":3,"text":"So what I've tried to\nargue is that at one level,"},"2635":{"dur":3,"text":"there are a lot of similarities\nbetween Gobekli and Catalhoyuk."},"2639":{"dur":4,"text":"Very similar sets of symbolism."},"2643":{"dur":3,"text":"But the big difference is\nthat at Catalhoyuk, this"},"2646":{"dur":2,"text":"has become a domestic\ncult, and has"},"2648":{"dur":2,"text":"integrated into everyday life."},"2651":{"dur":5,"text":"And Gobekli, it's very much\npart of a ritual center."},"2656":{"dur":3,"text":"And in concluding,\nwhat I've been trying"},"2660":{"dur":7,"text":"to argue is that these types\nof collective ritual action"},"2667":{"dur":3,"text":"occur in both places\nassociated with the killing,"},"2671":{"dur":3,"text":"teasing, baiting, and\nfeasting on wild animals"},"2675":{"dur":4,"text":"and creating memories\naround those events,"},"2679":{"dur":4,"text":"but as well as this focus on\nthe collective of that type,"},"2683":{"dur":4,"text":"we also get the focus on\ndeath and ancestry, which"},"2687":{"dur":3,"text":"not only, again, create\nlinkages and relationships"},"2691":{"dur":5,"text":"between people, but also very\ncrucially create time depth."},"2696":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's not enough\nto have a network."},"2700":{"dur":4,"text":"You need to have that\nnetwork that has time depth."},"2704":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's because of the nature\nof intensive use of resources"},"2709":{"dur":1,"text":"and agriculture."},"2710":{"dur":3,"text":"In agriculture, there\nis a delayed return"},"2714":{"dur":2,"text":"for your labor input."},"2716":{"dur":4,"text":"As a hunter-gatherer, we\ngo of and kill an animal,"},"2720":{"dur":2,"text":"and we share it, and then\nwe can just disperse."},"2723":{"dur":2,"text":"There's nothing to\nhold us together."},"2725":{"dur":2,"text":"But with farming, we\nclear the land together,"},"2728":{"dur":8,"text":"and we invest in plows, or\nin other types of equipment."},"2737":{"dur":3,"text":"So we've invested, and we have\nto hold the community together"},"2741":{"dur":2,"text":"before we get to\nreturn for that labor."},"2744":{"dur":3,"text":"And so the crucial\ndistinction about farmers"},"2747":{"dur":2,"text":"is that they have time depth."},"2749":{"dur":2,"text":"And the important thing\nis that time debt focus"},"2752":{"dur":4,"text":"emerged very early,\neven before farming,"},"2756":{"dur":1,"text":"and before settled life."},"2758":{"dur":3,"text":"The focus on history making\nhappens very, very early,"},"2762":{"dur":2,"text":"as hunter-gatherers\nbecome more intensive"},"2764":{"dur":2,"text":"and start investing in\nmore and more things."},"2767":{"dur":1,"text":"And that takes me\ninto another topic,"},"2769":{"dur":2,"text":"which the a topic of my book,\nwhich is \"Entanglement,\""},"2771":{"dur":2,"text":"because I think a very\nimportant key thing here,"},"2773":{"dur":3,"text":"which I haven't talked about,\nis how humans just get entangled"},"2776":{"dur":1,"text":"in more and more stuff."},"2778":{"dur":3,"text":"And that entanglement leads\nto longer term relationships"},"2781":{"dur":2,"text":"of various sorts."},"2784":{"dur":2,"text":"But the domestication\nof plants and animals"},"2787":{"dur":2,"text":"is an example of entanglement."},"2789":{"dur":2,"text":"But one could extend that to\nall the other types of things"},"2792":{"dur":1,"text":"like houses, and\npottery, and so on that"},"2794":{"dur":3,"text":"people are beginning\nto make at this time."},"2797":{"dur":4,"text":"So thank you

Gobekli?"},"2810":{"dur":1,"text":"IAN HODDER: Quite a long way."},"2812":{"dur":4,"text":"So Gobekli is the right in\nthe southeast of Turkey,"},"2816":{"dur":3,"text":"and Catalhoyuk is\nright in the middle."},"2820":{"dur":2,"text":"I figured I actually don't\nknow what the numbers are,"},"2822":{"dur":2,"text":"but it must be 600,\n700, 800 kilometers."},"2825":{"dur":2,"text":"Something like that."},"2827":{"dur":2,"text":"AUDIENCE: How does the\nkind of observations"},"2830":{"dur":2,"text":"of ritual and\nculture in this area"},"2833":{"dur":2,"text":"compare to other areas\nof the ancient world?"},"2838":{"dur":2,"text":"IAN HODDER: Well, I should say,\nwhen you say the ancient world,"},"2840":{"dur":3,"text":"there are lots and\nlots of locations"},"2844":{"dur":1,"text":"for the origins of agriculture."},"2846":{"dur":1,"text":"It used to be thought\nthat there were very few,"},"2848":{"dur":4,"text":"but now we recognize that\nyou have independent origins,"},"2852":{"dur":3,"text":"obviously in China, in New\nGuinea, in the Americas,"},"2856":{"dur":1,"text":"in Africa, and so on."},"2857":{"dur":3,"text":"So there are lots and\nlots of independent,"},"2861":{"dur":2,"text":"with different crops,\nand different processes,"},"2863":{"dur":1,"text":"and different sequences."},"2865":{"dur":4,"text":"So on the whole, the modern view\nis that very different things"},"2869":{"dur":1,"text":"happen in different places."},"2871":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'm not trying to make\nan argument, generally."},"2874":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm just trying to make\nan argument for this one"},"2876":{"dur":1,"text":"particular case."},"2877":{"dur":2,"text":"Which is often seen\nas a sort of key case,"},"2879":{"dur":1,"text":"because it's probably\nthe earliest."},"2884":{"dur":1,"text":"AUDIENCE: Sorry,\nI forgot the name,"},"2886":{"dur":3,"text":"but there's a site in Jordan\nthat's supposed to be--"},"2889":{"dur":1,"text":"IAN HODDER:

also\ndeveloped agriculture"},"2905":{"dur":1,"text":"while they were living there."},"2906":{"dur":2,"text":"So they were first\njust collecting,"},"2909":{"dur":2,"text":"and then started planting\nlater, and stuff like that."},"2911":{"dur":1,"text":"I think it's about\nthe same time--"},"2913":{"dur":1,"text":"IAN HODDER: That's right."},"2914":{"dur":1,"text":"It's probably Ain

ritual"},"2922":{"dur":2,"text":"as you described in Catalhoyuk."},"2925":{"dur":1,"text":"And how would you\ncompare the two?"},"2930":{"dur":2,"text":"IAN HODDER: Ain Ghazal does have\na lot of very elaborate ritual."},"2932":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, particularly ancestral\ncults of various sorts."},"2936":{"dur":1,"text":"There are quite\nremarkable collections"},"2938":{"dur":5,"text":"of these

easygoing."},"2962":{"dur":2,"text":"IAN HODDER: [LAUGHING]"},"2967":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, Gobekli and Catalhoyuk\nare really distinctive,"},"2970":{"dur":1,"text":"in that for various\nreasons, they"},"2972":{"dur":4,"text":"have this enormous concentration\nof stuff that survived."},"2976":{"dur":2,"text":"And you do get little\nbits and pieces of it"},"2978":{"dur":1,"text":"in nearly all these other sites."},"2980":{"dur":2,"text":"You get, for\nexample, a depiction"},"2982":{"dur":3,"text":"of a headless body, or a\nvulture, or a bucranium,"},"2985":{"dur":1,"text":"which is a bull's head."},"2987":{"dur":3,"text":"So there are lots of bits and\npieces all over the place."},"2991":{"dur":4,"text":"But in general terms, all of\nit is about either wild animals"},"2995":{"dur":2,"text":"or about ancestry."},"2997":{"dur":4,"text":"And I imagine that you\nhave similar amounts stuff,"},"3001":{"dur":2,"text":"but a lot of it will be on\nthings that haven't survived."},"3004":{"dur":3,"text":"And Catalhoyuk and Gobekli, it's\njust lucky for various reasons"},"3008":{"dur":2,"text":"that their stuff\nwas preserved there."},"3011":{"dur":2,"text":"AUDIENCE: So do you find\nany evidence of conflict"},"3013":{"dur":1,"text":"with outsiders?"},"3015":{"dur":4,"text":"Do find any evidence of\nprotection structures"},"3020":{"dur":0,"text":"or something like that?"},"3021":{"dur":3,"text":"Or is this just a settlement,\nand you know, like everybody"},"3024":{"dur":1,"text":"was living peacefully?"},"3026":{"dur":4,"text":"So the dominant\nview of my project"},"3031":{"dur":3,"text":"so far has been\nthat it's a society"},"3034":{"dur":1,"text":"with very little violence."},"3036":{"dur":4,"text":"There are not being defensive\nstructures of any sort."},"3041":{"dur":4,"text":"And there is no evidence\nof lots of violent attack."},"3045":{"dur":3,"text":"So in many archaeological\nsites around the world"},"3048":{"dur":2,"text":"of a later time period,\nyou find skeletons"},"3051":{"dur":1,"text":"with arrowheads stuck\nthrough the spine,"},"3053":{"dur":1,"text":"or stuck through the skull."},"3054":{"dur":3,"text":"We haven't found anything\nlike that at all."},"3058":{"dur":5,"text":"So in my view, this was a\nvery, very well-ordered,"},"3063":{"dur":4,"text":"structured, peaceful society."},"3067":{"dur":4,"text":"Catalhoyuk is very much on its\nown in a very large landscape,"},"3071":{"dur":4,"text":"so there's not a lot of\ncompetition from outside."},"3075":{"dur":2,"text":"But that has been\nrecent work that"},"3078":{"dur":1,"text":"is starting to\nchallenge a bit of that,"},"3080":{"dur":2,"text":"because more careful\nstudy is showing"},"3083":{"dur":4,"text":"a lot of depressed fractures\non skulls on Catalhoyuk people."},"3087":{"dur":2,"text":"And these seem to be\nhealed structures."},"3090":{"dur":3,"text":"It's not the people were\ndying as a result of this."},"3093":{"dur":4,"text":"And so it may be more that there\nwas a sort of ritual

battles,\nand they would hit"},"3106":{"dur":1,"text":"each other over the\nhead, not to kill them,"},"3108":{"dur":3,"text":"but as part of these\nritual practices."},"3111":{"dur":4,"text":"So probably, it wasn't as\npeaceful as one imagines."},"3115":{"dur":2,"text":"But we're doing more work on\ntrying to understand that."},"3117":{"dur":2,"text":"But certainly, there\nwasn't large-scale
