about."},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a Fourier transform spectroscopy as an NMR"},"480":{"dur":1,"text":"spectroscopist would use it and I\u2019m going to take"},"482":{"dur":3,"text":"as an example

studying."},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"Because each nucleus in the periodic table has"},"540":{"dur":4,"text":"a different gyromagnetic ratio factor."},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"So our resonant frequency becomes a function"},"547":{"dur":1,"text":"of each nucleus."},"549":{"dur":1,"text":"So we get different resonant frequencies for"},"551":{"dur":3,"text":"hydrogen, carbon, phosphorus, sodium and so on,"},"554":{"dur":1,"text":"and all the others."},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"And even more interestingly, is if I look at"},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"one molecular species, all the hydrogens

it."},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"We can home in on one particular chemical"},"596":{"dur":4,"text":"species and it is a quantitative measurement."},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"And in the Fourier transform

time"},"715":{"dur":3,"text":"domain acquisition but we are acquiring data in"},"718":{"dur":3,"text":"Fourier space, in K space and you can imagine,"},"722":{"dur":1,"text":"you can think of it that

lengthy."},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"That might take you minutes to do if you're going"},"769":{"dur":3,"text":"to do it in a robust, quantitative way."},"772":{"dur":2,"text":"You get some very nice images out of it."},"774":{"dur":4,"text":"So here is a column filled with spheres and then"},"778":{"dur":2,"text":"water poured into that column, just as an"},"781":{"dur":1,"text":"example and then

intensity"},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"back from the water and no signal intensity from"},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"the glass spheres."},"792":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is a mock-up essentially of a small reactor."},"795":{"dur":3,"text":"Right, so that\u2019s an image and then if I want to"},"799":{"dur":3,"text":"look at how liquids or substances are moving"},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"within the reactor, I could do what I did with"},"804":{"dur":0,"text":"the heart..."},"805":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, I didn't take that heart experiment but you"},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"saw with the heart

pulse\ngradients."},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"And what you're doing then is you're encoding"},"828":{"dur":3,"text":"the nuclear spin system with a phase and then"},"831":{"dur":1,"text":"you look at the difference in phase of the spin"},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"system between that time point and that time point."},"837":{"dur":2,"text":"And from that, you can measure the distance"},"839":{"dur":3,"text":"travelled in that time interval, big delta,"},"842":{"dur":2,"text":"from which you get a velocity."},"844":{"dur":3,"text":"And so now for every image pixel, there
