It's not the remainder, it's not the flesh and bones that are left afterwards."},"558":{"dur":4,"text":"- Yeah.\n- Because in the Zebra Bits video, we\u2014 all we got from that zebra was part of a skull"},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"with the ears gone, and the skull cap missing, and the brains taken out,\n- Yeah."},"566":{"dur":7,"text":"- and like, a big chunk of the shoulder.\n- And yeah, eyeball gone, cheeks, yeah like it was totally... yeah."},"573":{"dur":7,"text":"- And I feel like I can personally kind of detach from it too, because you know that the parts that have been missing"},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"and the parts that have been taken out have been gone to be used for a better purpose.\n- Yeah."},"584":{"dur":5,"text":"- I personally think it's better than seeing an animal all bloated on the side of the road.\n- I agree."},"590":{"dur":6,"text":"- Obviously, like, we can't go out and bury every animal.

I have pets, I love them very much, and if they were ever hurt or\u2014 I mean, I'd be super sad. It's really hard."},"638":{"dur":7,"text":"And we get a lot of animals that are like, banged up and like, they come from wildlife sanctuaries and like, they're not in the best of shape,"},"646":{"dur":8,"text":"and they died a hard death. Like, they probably suffered when they died. Obviously not at the hands of any of us, but like...\n- Right."},"655":{"dur":7,"text":"- It was hard for them. And that's hard. It's hard to get animals and see like, awful abscesses and cavities, and to know that they lived their life in pain."},"665":{"dur":8,"text":"But that is life, that's real. And I- it's not by my hands. It's not\u2014 like, you're not doing it."},"673":{"dur":4,"text":"So like, I'm not like, \"Emily, you should really stop giving candy to these squirrels.\""},"678":{"dur":11,"text":"So because it's a part of life and this is by, like quite literally, this is by nature. Like, this is totally natural, for..."},"689":{"dur":4,"text":"- Unless something got hit by a car, really.\n- Yeah. It's by nature for things to suffer."},"694":{"dur":8,"text":"Like, this is natural. Suffering, dying is natural. And it's really hard to take, but I feel that it makes me stronger."},"702":{"dur":8,"text":"I feel like it helps me become a better person and I can know how to gauge bad things. I don't know.\n- Your own level."},"711":{"dur":6,"text":"Yeah, I always feel like if I have a bad day, it's kind of like, \"aw, I stubbed my toe and my toe hurts really bad and that sucks.\""},"718":{"dur":6,"text":"Guess what? I have a warm home to go to at the end of the day, and there's food in my refrigerator, and..."},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"- And you don't have a cavity that drives you crazy that you can like, suck pus out of every day."},"727":{"dur":10,"text":"- Yeah, like, cue squirrel with an abscess. I don't have a giant pus filled sack of bacterial infection growing out of my face."},"737":{"dur":4,"text":"- And it's sad yeah, and there are some days that I take my work home with me, and it's hard. It's hard."},"742":{"dur":5,"text":"But it's all for the greater good, and I think that I just remember that at the end of the day."},"747":{"dur":6,"text":"- When you take a genetic sample\u2014 I'm only asking this because people were really concerned about this in some of our episodes\u2014"},"754":{"dur":4,"text":"When you take a genetic sample, like a tissue sample, and you do it with your bare hands,"},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"is there a way that you can like, be contaminating that by handling it without gloves?"},"762":{"dur":6,"text":"- Well, so I'm sure, in theory, there's a way that I could be contaminating it. My...\n- If you licked it."},"769":{"dur":10,"text":"- Yeah, like if I spat on it, and rubbed it, but what I know is what my bosses tell me. And my bosses have been doing this for multiple, multiple decades."},"779":{"dur":7,"text":"And so all of their DNA samples have been synthesized and processed and everything, and so my understanding\u2014"},"787":{"dur":5,"text":"\u2014 which I'm sure there's many different understandings, I mean, this is science, so there's like a million different ways to answer one question\u2014"},"793":{"dur":8,"text":"\u2014 that is, you know, you're skinning an animal, their DNA is all over your hands, and so anything that you have on your fingers,"},"801":{"dur":6,"text":"your DNA is so small that you don't like, have\u2014 there's not like, loads of DNA like right here."},"808":{"dur":6,"text":"And plus, I'm just working with this animal; their blood is all over my fingers. So if I put that then into a tube,"},"816":{"dur":4,"text":"that's nothing that I'm concerned about, nor are my bosses.\n- Yeah."},"820":{"dur":7,"text":"- And I'm sure that there are some labs out there that would argue differently and that's totally cool. Everybody has their own practice."},"828":{"dur":5,"text":"- But that just kinda goes back to like your job being so unique. You know, you're not an anatomist, you're not\u2014"},"833":{"dur":9,"text":"I mean you are in a sense of the word, but you're not a veterinarian, you're not a coroner, you're a mammal preparator for a natural history museum."},"843":{"dur":10,"text":"- Yeah and like, I'm not trying to... man, I'm not conducting any studies, I'm not a researcher, I'm not an artist, I'm not recreating anything, I'm a butcher."},"853":{"dur":8,"text":"So like, for me to even know bones or muscles is like completely unnecessary for my job, even though I find those interesting, it's unnecessary."},"861":{"dur":7,"text":"I don't need to know what any bone is. I just need to know how to get it out of the body. I need to know how to preserve it for a museum collection"},"869":{"dur":9,"text":"so that 2 years, 5 years, 100, 300 years from now, someone can look at that and it's not moldy and degraded."},"878":{"dur":7,"text":"- Nice. I think, you know, knowing anatomy definitely adds value to your job. That's cool.\n- I dig it. I like it."},"886":{"dur":4,"text":"But it's definitely not like, a job description.\n- Yeah."},"890":{"dur":4,"text":"- I have to be good with my hands, I've gotta know what I'm doing, and I have to do it the most efficient way possible."},"895":{"dur":11,"text":"- I used to wear a lab coat in Montana. I didn't have any real formal job training with my volunteer position. I did not have an Anna Goldman to go to for guidance."},"906":{"dur":7,"text":"And so we just kind of wore lab coats as standard practice because that's just something that we did. And earning your lab coat was a big deal,"},"913":{"dur":8,"text":"it was almost like a ceremonial thing. I remember the day I got my lab coat. Like, you know, my name was like put on the rack where all the other coats were hung,"},"922":{"dur":6,"text":"and I got a brand new lab coat and then wearing it and it still had all the wrinkles in it and then you like, you get blood stains on it and you're like,"},"929":{"dur":8,"text":"\"This was my wolf, and this was my chipmunk.\" Like it was more... probably like a ceremonial thing.\n- A rite of passage?"},"937":{"dur":7,"text":"- Yeah! Like a rite of passage more than like, actually needing to wear it. 'Cause we never washed the lab coats, so they were just gross all the time."},"944":{"dur":9,"text":"So... we didn't have a big budget. So are you concerned that you don't wear a lab coat that you're going to have blood all over your clothes?"},"954":{"dur":2,"text":"Or you're gonna go home and you're gonna smell like dead stuff all day?"},"956":{"dur":4,"text":"- Since it's my job every day, it's kind of like, part of my job to get blood on my clothes."},"961":{"dur":4,"text":"- That's written in the job description.\n- That's written: \"blood on your clothes.\""},"966":{"dur":10,"text":"No, I mean, I'm handling smelly, dirty things pretty much every day and so I know that I don't wear nice clothes. I don't wear clacky shoes."},"977":{"dur":5,"text":"I don't wear skirts or dresses. These are the clothes that I wear because they're inexpensive and I can clean them easy."},"982":{"dur":5,"text":"And if I come home with the smell my dogs are really happy and my clothes go in the washing machine."},"987":{"dur":11,"text":"I mean, this? This like, dead sheep on my head? This is like a sponge for odor like you wouldn't believe. So like, I bathe, I mean, this is..."},"999":{"dur":4,"text":"- You?! You? Shower?\n- Me. Even me. I bathe."},"1003":{"dur":4,"text":"- I think that's really interesting that so many people are concerned about your clothes. And they're concerned about your wedding ring."},"1008":{"dur":4,"text":"They're concerned that you're gonna like get gunk under your ring, and...\n- Yeah, so the thing about a ring is that it doesn't come off easy."},"1012":{"dur":4,"text":"Otherwise you couldn't wave to people 'cause your ring would fly off. Well the same thing goes when your hands are in guts."},"1017":{"dur":7,"text":"And I intentionally have a wedding ring that like, does not have anything else going on it, 'cause if I did it'd get all bloody and crummy."},"1025":{"dur":9,"text":"So like, yeah. This is my wedding ring. It stays on my hand, like everybody else's wedding ring. I'm married. This is what it looks like when you're married."},"1037":{"dur":2,"text":"- So what about your tattoos?"},"1039":{"dur":10,"text":"- My tattoos are symbolic of things that I've done in my life and it's important\u2014 I like mile-markers, I like journals, I like to remember things, and so,"},"1049":{"dur":5,"text":"since I fell in love with mosquitoes, I got a mosquito when I was really young.\n- Awww."},"1054":{"dur":3,"text":"- I was very, very young. My mother was very upset with me."},"1058":{"dur":7,"text":"But I don't\u2014 I obviously don't regret it because I'm still in the field and it's a very important time for me."},"1065":{"dur":8,"text":"And then I have a praying mantis because college was hard and I graduated and I feel like I accomplished something really big."},"1074":{"dur":6,"text":"And I feel like the mantises are like the... they're like the...\n- Victors."},"1080":{"dur":5,"text":"- Yeah, they're so cool.

It's as big as any other field, and me, personally, like I'm intimidated by math."},"1146":{"dur":7,"text":"It's not that I'm awful, it just, it takes me a while.
