time."},"185":{"dur":1,"text":"I was the editor of our\nhigh school newspaper,"},"187":{"dur":2,"text":"the Purple Parrot; I wrote articles"},"190":{"dur":2,"text":"about the presumption of innocence."},"192":{"dur":2,"text":"Unfortunately, it didn't\ndo all that much good."},"195":{"dur":2,"text":"And then we went our separate ways."},"197":{"dur":1,"text":"The way we like to put it now is:"},"199":{"dur":3,"text":"Marc went to Yale, Marty went to jail."},"203":{"dur":2,"text":"But then we reconnected 10 years later,"},"206":{"dur":1,"text":"and I started to work on his case."},"208":{"dur":2,"text":"I started to get very\ninvolved with his legal team."},"210":{"dur":1,"text":"I wrote an op-ed in the New York Times."},"212":{"dur":3,"text":"I wrote a brief that was part of his 19th,"},"215":{"dur":3,"text":"and ultimately successful, appeal."},"218":{"dur":2,"text":"It took almost 18 years."},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"It took, by his count, 6,336 days."},"225":{"dur":3,"text":"But Marty was eventually exonerated."},"229":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, since then, since\ngetting out, he actually"},"233":{"dur":3,"text":"within two weeks was\nenrolled in college classes."},"237":{"dur":2,"text":"Got his BA in record time."},"240":{"dur":1,"text":"He had some credits from\nwhen he was in prison,"},"242":{"dur":2,"text":"before they cut funding\nfor education in prison."},"245":{"dur":2,"text":"He then went on to work as a paralegal"},"247":{"dur":2,"text":"and take law school classes at night,"},"249":{"dur":2,"text":"and finally got his JD\nfrom Turro Law School."},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"And I went out for his\ngraduation to be with him"},"253":{"dur":1,"text":"and celebrate, and he's now studying for"},"255":{"dur":3,"text":"the New

right?"},"265":{"dur":3,"text":"But for me, the outrage\nthat I felt initially,"},"269":{"dur":2,"text":"learning about my friend's\nstory and my friend's case"},"271":{"dur":4,"text":"and his trauma didn't go\naway with his happy ending."},"276":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, it only grew and expanded."},"279":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, when I think, in\nparticular, how hard it was"},"283":{"dur":3,"text":"for him as someone who had\neverything in his favor,"},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"in the sense that he was\nwhite, upper middle class,"},"289":{"dur":3,"text":"Long Island, New York, mass media market,"},"292":{"dur":3,"text":"pro bono attorneys from\ntop law firms across DC"},"296":{"dur":2,"text":"and New York, communications\nconsultants working"},"299":{"dur":3,"text":"on a website, trying to\nprove the facts of his case,"},"302":{"dur":3,"text":"and it was still so hard and took so long."},"306":{"dur":4,"text":"So, for me, this outrage\nonly grew beyond Marty."},"312":{"dur":2,"text":"Because it changed my life\nand it gave me a desire"},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"to do something much bigger."},"318":{"dur":1,"text":"I then went to law school."},"320":{"dur":1,"text":"I was a tenured professor at Georgetown"},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"and a first-year law\nstudent at the same time."},"324":{"dur":3,"text":"And there, at least one of\nmy former law professors"},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"is here right now."},"329":{"dur":4,"text":"I went out and got my JD,\npassed the New York bar exam,"},"334":{"dur":3,"text":"am now a licensed attorney\nwho never practices"},"337":{"dur":1,"text":"and perhaps never will,"},"340":{"dur":4,"text":"but now my entire research\nfocus and teaching focus"},"344":{"dur":1,"text":"has really shifted in the area"},"346":{"dur":3,"text":"of criminal justice and prison reform."},"349":{"dur":3,"text":"And to me, it's no longer just\nabout Marty as an individual."},"353":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's not even about what\nthe next logical step was,"},"356":{"dur":1,"text":"which was other wrongful convictions,"},"358":{"dur":3,"text":"and I got very involved in other cases"},"362":{"dur":3,"text":"and many of the other exonerees\nthat I've gotten to know,"},"365":{"dur":3,"text":"and the thing that's so\ndifficult about wrongful"},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"convictions is not only\nthat an innocent person"},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"gets put away, it's that the\nperson who committed the crime"},"374":{"dur":1,"text":"is actually free to commit other crimes,"},"375":{"dur":1,"text":"which creates more victims,\nand that's happened"},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"in many cases of wrongful convictions."},"380":{"dur":3,"text":"But then it went way beyond that."},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's also about the so-called guilty."},"386":{"dur":3,"text":"The people who are in prison\nwho did commit a crime"},"389":{"dur":3,"text":"and perhaps did deserve\npunishment in many cases."},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"But people who've made\nmistakes in their lives."},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"But they're people who\nshould not necessarily"},"398":{"dur":1,"text":"be defined by the worst thing"},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"they've done in their life, forever."},"403":{"dur":0,"text":"Indelibly."},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's about how people\nare treated in prison,"},"408":{"dur":4,"text":"and how we, as a society,\nchoose to treat people who have"},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"made mistakes, and the\nconditions that we put them in."},"415":{"dur":4,"text":"And how society forgets\nabout them and abandons them."},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"So, almost two years\nago, I took a new step."},"423":{"dur":2,"text":"Which is I started\nvolunteering, teaching at the"},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"Jessup Correctional Institution,\nwhich is as I mentioned,"},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"a maximum security prison\nin Jessup, Maryland."},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"You've probably driven\nclose by it, many times,"},"433":{"dur":3,"text":"on your way to BWI\nAirport, going up on 95."},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"And I have to say that,\nfrom the very first time"},"440":{"dur":3,"text":"I walked in there, and it\ncontinues every single time"},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"I go in, including yesterday,"},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"it's the most inspiring\nteaching experience"},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"that I ever have had before."},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"And I mean no offense to\nmy Georgetown students."},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughing)"},"454":{"dur":1,"text":"And there are many of them here,"},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"but I know that they won't take offense,"},"457":{"dur":1,"text":"because many of them,\nespecially those who have"},"459":{"dur":1,"text":"taken my Prisons and Punishment class,"},"461":{"dur":1,"text":"have actually come on visits to Jessup,"},"463":{"dur":1,"text":"and they understand\nwhat I'm talking about."},"464":{"dur":3,"text":"Many of them also have\nmet my students at Jessup."},"468":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, this semester, I've\ngone an even further step,"},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"which is I'm teaching\na class and I think all"},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"of the students are here\nfrom Georgetown, called:"},"477":{"dur":1,"text":"Prison Reform Project."},"479":{"dur":3,"text":"Where we're going into Jessup\nand working with another group"},"483":{"dur":3,"text":"of 15 Jessup students, and\nthey're working together,"},"486":{"dur":4,"text":"collaboratively, on a set\nof prison reform projects"},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"that they're gonna be also\npresenting at an event"},"493":{"dur":1,"text":"that the Prisons and Justice Initiative"},"495":{"dur":3,"text":"is gonna be hosting at\nthe end of the semester."},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"In addition to that, I've also\nbeen running a colloquium,"},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"we call it, on world politics at Jessup."},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"Where every week, I bring\nin a different Georgetown"},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"faculty member to give a guest lecture."},"510":{"dur":4,"text":"And invariably, they walk\nout completely changed"},"514":{"dur":4,"text":"each time, struck by the\nhumanity, struck by the stories,"},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"struck by the lives,\nthe real people who are"},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"in those classes, and\nalso the intelligence"},"523":{"dur":3,"text":"and the curiosity that they have."},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"And how excited they are about learning."},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"And it really gets to the\ncore of what learning,"},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"and what teaching are all about"},"534":{"dur":4,"text":"that we experience every\nweek going into Jessup."},"538":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's not just about Jessup."},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"I think this experience is\nshared by people who've taught"},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"in many different carceral institutions."},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"If I had more time, I\nwould tell you stories"},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"about the creativity,\nabout the determination,"},"553":{"dur":4,"text":"about the preparation,\nabout the dedication,"},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"and also about the great sense of humor"},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"that my students at Jessup have."},"562":{"dur":1,"text":"But let me just say that most of all,"},"564":{"dur":3,"text":"what I've learned is that formal education"},"567":{"dur":4,"text":"and intelligence are not\nalways very well correlated."},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"And that I have some of\nmy brightest students"},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"that I've ever had are people"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"who stopped school in eighth grade."},"581":{"dur":0,"text":"Right?"},"582":{"dur":4,"text":"And what happens is that\nwhen you give them a chance,"},"587":{"dur":1,"text":"when you treat them with respect,"},"589":{"dur":3,"text":"when you encourage and support them,"},"593":{"dur":3,"text":"when you believe in them and\nthey sense that you believe"},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"in them, they can shine and they can soar."},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's what I've been\nseeing, and it's very powerful."},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is the kind of\nhuman perspective that we,"},"606":{"dur":1,"text":"in the Prisons and Justice Initiative,"},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"are trying to bring to a wider group,"},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"and ultimately to society."},"613":{"dur":3,"text":"Because it's important to\nremember that 95 percent"},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"of prisoners will eventually be released."},"620":{"dur":3,"text":"And we have a responsibility to society,"},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"which really means to\nourselves, to our children,"},"627":{"dur":3,"text":"to future potential victims of crime,"},"631":{"dur":3,"text":"we have a responsibility\nto help these people"},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"who will be coming out to be prepared"},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"to stay away from a life\nof violence or crime,"},"641":{"dur":4,"text":"but also to be prepared to be\nproductive members of society."},"647":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's really crucial."},"648":{"dur":3,"text":"So if I had the stage to myself tonight,"},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"I could go on for hours, and\nsome of my students know this."},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"I could talk about the\ndetails of mass incarceration."},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"About statistics."},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"I would love to show graphs showing how"},"662":{"dur":3,"text":"the US and Europe, historically,\nhad very similar levels"},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"of incarceration, going over decades."},"668":{"dur":3,"text":"And then the late 1970s hit,\nand then (exhaling sharply)"},"672":{"dur":3,"text":"it spiked in the US and\nit stayed level in Europe."},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"And some people say: oh,\nthat's because of crime rates."},"678":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, if you look at crime rates,"},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"they actually fluctuate\ntogether, the US and Europe."},"682":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not about crime rates."},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"It's about political\ndecisions that were made"},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"to lock more people up\nfor longer periods of time"},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"in worse conditions, with\nfewer rights and opportunities"},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"and fewer possibilities for release."},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"And fewer opportunities to live"},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"productively when they come out."},"697":{"dur":3,"text":"These were political\nchoices that were made."},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"The other element, and I\nknow some of the speakers"},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"are gonna talk about this tonight,"},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"are the overwhelming racial disparities"},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"in the criminal justice system."},"710":{"dur":3,"text":"And they permeate every\nsingle stage of it."},"713":{"dur":3,"text":"From stops to frisks to\narrests to convictions"},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"to sentences to capital punishment."},"720":{"dur":2,"text":"At every single stage,\nthere are tremendous"},"722":{"dur":4,"text":"racial disparities that\ncannot be explained away."},"728":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, so what can we do\nabout this at Georgetown?"},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"Why create a Prisons\nand Justice Initiative?"},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"Let me give you three reasons, okay?"},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"First, I think this fits in very well"},"739":{"dur":3,"text":"with President DeJoya's\nimportant remarks last week."},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"He has plans to develop\nand strengthen Georgetown's"},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"research and teaching activities"},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"that focus on the theme\nof racial injustice."},"752":{"dur":1,"text":"And this fits in perfectly with that."},"753":{"dur":1,"text":"Institutions all around the country are"},"755":{"dur":2,"text":"struggling to deal with this challenge,"},"758":{"dur":4,"text":"both historical and\ncontemporary, and I'm pleased"},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"that Georgetown is now leading the way"},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"in this regard, and we're a part of that."},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"Second, when I looked\naround at Georgetown,"},"769":{"dur":2,"text":"at what we're already doing,"},"772":{"dur":4,"text":"I realized that we actually\nhave the resources here already."},"776":{"dur":3,"text":"In other words, we have remarkable faculty"},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"in law, in public policy, in history,"},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"in sociology and\nanthropology and government,"},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"philosophy, theology, English, even music,"},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"as you're gonna learn tonight."},"791":{"dur":3,"text":"Who do fascinating work and teaching,"},"794":{"dur":3,"text":"related to criminal justice and prisons."},"798":{"dur":4,"text":"We have over 30 faculty, and\nI probably have missed some,"},"802":{"dur":3,"text":"and up to 40 courses that\nactually deal with themes"},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"that are related to criminal\njustice and prisons."},"808":{"dur":1,"text":"And even since our announcement went out,"},"809":{"dur":1,"text":"I've learned about new people."},"811":{"dur":1,"text":"I've been contacted by\npeople at the medical school,"},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"at the business school, who've\ntold me how their research"},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"ties in and how they\nwanna become involved."},"817":{"dur":1,"text":"It's extraordinary."},"819":{"dur":2,"text":"And then of course, what\nwe have at Georgetown"},"821":{"dur":3,"text":"is really the backbone of it\nall, which is the students."},"824":{"dur":3,"text":"We have incredibly engaged, committed,"},"827":{"dur":2,"text":"and passionate students,\nand they have made"},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"criminal justice and prison reform one"},"832":{"dur":2,"text":"of the primary issues of their generation,"},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"and I think that's really important."},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"So in other words the\ningredients for this initiative"},"838":{"dur":3,"text":"were already there, we just\nneed to put them together."},"842":{"dur":3,"text":"And third, the third reason\nis that for the first time"},"845":{"dur":4,"text":"in 40 years, we actually\nhave a real opportunity to"},"850":{"dur":4,"text":"bring about a reversal of this\ntide of mass incarceration."},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact, we seem to be at some type"},"858":{"dur":2,"text":"of a turning point, here."},"861":{"dur":2,"text":"It's ironic, but criminal\njustice reform seems to be"},"864":{"dur":3,"text":"the only issue right now that\nRepublicans and Democrats"},"867":{"dur":2,"text":"in Congress can agree on."},"869":{"dur":3,"text":"It's the only issue where the\nKoch brothers and George Soros"},"873":{"dur":3,"text":"see eye-to-eye and are\nfunding the same types"},"876":{"dur":2,"text":"of projects and organizations."},"878":{"dur":3,"text":"Where Corey Booker and Rand\nPaul have become good pals."},"881":{"dur":2,"text":"Where Chuck Grassley and Patrick Lahey"},"883":{"dur":3,"text":"are co-sponsoring legislation."},"886":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, they don't always\nagree on the reasons."},"889":{"dur":2,"text":"Some of them emphasize cost savings."},"891":{"dur":1,"text":"It's about budgets."},"893":{"dur":3,"text":"There's an $80 billion a year industry."},"896":{"dur":2,"text":"That's what the corrections costs."},"901":{"dur":2,"text":"It costs 30 to $50,000 a year,"},"903":{"dur":2,"text":"depending on the facility,\nto incarcerate a person."},"906":{"dur":1,"text":"Some are saying: we just\nneed to trim our costs."},"907":{"dur":1,"text":"We need to be more efficient."},"909":{"dur":2,"text":"Others are looking at a\nmore spiritual dimension."},"912":{"dur":4,"text":"Looking at the notion of\nredemption, of second chances."},"917":{"dur":2,"text":"Still others are looking at\nthe human rights dimension."},"919":{"dur":2,"text":"Looking at the conditions within prisons,"},"921":{"dur":2,"text":"looking at the gross\nviolations of human rights"},"924":{"dur":2,"text":"that take place in solitary confinement."},"927":{"dur":1,"text":"Looking at the racial disparities"},"928":{"dur":3,"text":"that I alluded to that\nyou'll hear more about."},"932":{"dur":1,"text":"Despite the different reasons,"},"934":{"dur":3,"text":"there seems to be some bipartisan\nconsensus that has emerged"},"937":{"dur":2,"text":"about the need to reduce\nmass incarceration."},"940":{"dur":2,"text":"Mass incarceration has become a bad word"},"942":{"dur":2,"text":"or a bad phrase, and that's\nsomething that's really new."},"945":{"dur":2,"text":"Five years ago, you would get blank stares"},"947":{"dur":2,"text":"if you said mass incarceration."},"949":{"dur":1,"text":"And of course, a big part of that has been"},"950":{"dur":2,"text":"Michelle Alexander's\nbook, The New Jim Crow,"},"953":{"dur":4,"text":"which has really brought so\nmuch attention to this issue."},"957":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay, now, so there are\na lot of different ideas"},"958":{"dur":3,"text":"for how to go forward; the\nalliance is very tenuous."},"962":{"dur":2,"text":"It could come undone\nvery easily, but the goal"},"964":{"dur":2,"text":"for the Prisons and Justice\nInitiative at Georgetown"},"967":{"dur":4,"text":"is to create a non-partisan\nplatform for open"},"972":{"dur":2,"text":"and engaged debate that can help"},"975":{"dur":2,"text":"contribute to eventual solutions."},"977":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, here's what you can expect"},"980":{"dur":3,"text":"from the Prisons and Justice\nInitiative, going forward."},"983":{"dur":2,"text":"And we welcome ideas and input\nfrom people within Georgetown"},"986":{"dur":2,"text":"and from the community, as we go forward."},"989":{"dur":1,"text":"Basically, there are three pillars"},"990":{"dur":2,"text":"to the initiative, as we conceive of it."},"992":{"dur":2,"text":"First is to create a form\nof an academic center"},"995":{"dur":4,"text":"on campus that holds events,\nthat facilitates research,"},"1000":{"dur":3,"text":"and that supports student activities."},"1004":{"dur":2,"text":"Second, we wanna connect\npeople across the different"},"1007":{"dur":2,"text":"units at Georgetown; Georgetown\nhas a lot of different"},"1009":{"dur":2,"text":"units and campuses, we\nwanna be able to bring them"},"1011":{"dur":4,"text":"together, the people who are\nworking on interrelated topics."},"1016":{"dur":2,"text":"And then third, we wanna\nhelp integrate Georgetown,"},"1019":{"dur":1,"text":"and I use the word integrate\nintentionally, we wanna"},"1021":{"dur":4,"text":"help integrate Georgetown\nbetter into Washington DC."},"1025":{"dur":2,"text":"Because Washington DC,\nin addition to being"},"1028":{"dur":3,"text":"our nation's capital, is a\ncity that is deeply scarred"},"1031":{"dur":4,"text":"by legacies of racial injustice\nand of mass incarceration."},"1037":{"dur":3,"text":"And we wanna help play\na role in rebuilding"},"1040":{"dur":2,"text":"a more fair and just Washington DC."},"1044":{"dur":3,"text":"So, we have a lot of\nevents that are planned."},"1047":{"dur":1,"text":"Some have dates and are on the schedule,"},"1049":{"dur":2,"text":"and I
