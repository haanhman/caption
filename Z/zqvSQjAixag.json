But with the extension\nboom you have always got the opportunity to"},"350":{"dur":4,"text":"go large so we can unfold it and then put\na locking pin in place, and the next thing"},"355":{"dur":5,"text":"to do is then to de-rig the hook from the\nend of the boom. We can then add the extension"},"360":{"dur":4,"text":"boom onto the boom head and then the connection\neyes overlap and you push in a couple of steel"},"365":{"dur":6,"text":"pins to lock it in place.
