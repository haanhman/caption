the title of the series is A\nView from the Top."},"14":{"dur":3,"text":"I thought, well, I guess I've been on the\ntop of an organization before, so"},"17":{"dur":1,"text":"I can give some insights on that."},"19":{"dur":3,"text":"But I thought what would be interesting is\nthat I've also sorta been trampled."},"23":{"dur":5,"text":"And on the ground with people's feet on my\nhead, [NOISE] looking up."},"28":{"dur":3,"text":"So I maybe I can give a little perspective\nfrom that vantage point as well."},"32":{"dur":3,"text":"You do not want to hear me give a big long\nspeech, and I am not gonna do that."},"36":{"dur":5,"text":"I'm gonna reserved most of the time, for,\nfor a Q and A."},"41":{"dur":5,"text":"But in thinking about leadership I, I was\nsorta reflecting."},"46":{"dur":5,"text":"And I thought okay, what, what would I\nwant to share with young people who are in"},"52":{"dur":2,"text":"undergrad or graduate school today."},"54":{"dur":3,"text":"And there are three things through my\nexperiences in DC and"},"58":{"dur":3,"text":"now with Students First that I think could\nbe helpful."},"62":{"dur":2,"text":"Not in telling you specifically what you\nshould do or"},"64":{"dur":2,"text":"not do, but just to give you a sense of\nperspective."},"68":{"dur":2,"text":"So three things."},"70":{"dur":0,"text":"Very simple."},"71":{"dur":1,"text":"The first, this is,"},"72":{"dur":4,"text":"actually, this is a lesson that I learned,\nwhen I was the chancellor."},"77":{"dur":7,"text":"And it was one that came to me from a, a\nmentor and hero of mine, Joel Klein."},"84":{"dur":6,"text":"So, Joel is, used to be the the Chancellor\nof the New York City school system."},"91":{"dur":5,"text":"And long before I was working in DC, the\nmayor of D.C."},"96":{"dur":4,"text":"and the council members were trying to\nfigure out."},"100":{"dur":3,"text":"Whether they wanted to move to a mayoral\ncontrol model or not."},"104":{"dur":2,"text":"So they took a trip to New York."},"106":{"dur":2,"text":"They met with Joel Klein and Mike\nBloomberg."},"108":{"dur":1,"text":"They toured the schools."},"110":{"dur":2,"text":"They sorta saw what was going on there."},"112":{"dur":5,"text":"And at the end of that visit Adrian Fenty\nsaid to Joel Kline,"},"117":{"dur":5,"text":"okay I want somebody like you to come and\nrun the schools in D.C.."},"122":{"dur":3,"text":"Can you give me a recommendation?"},"125":{"dur":3,"text":"And Joel actually ended up recommending me\nfor the job."},"129":{"dur":3,"text":"And because of that he always felt this\nincredible sense of guilt."},"134":{"dur":3,"text":"And so he would call me and kinda you\nknow, check up on me all the time."},"138":{"dur":4,"text":"So I remember one evening in the height of"},"142":{"dur":4,"text":"sorta my first 100 days when things were\nreally getting a little tough."},"148":{"dur":1,"text":"I was driving home one night."},"150":{"dur":2,"text":"It's raining outside."},"152":{"dur":2,"text":"It's like 11 o'clock at night and my phone\nrings."},"155":{"dur":0,"text":"And I look at it and"},"156":{"dur":3,"text":"I see that it's from Joel Klein, so I pull\nover to the side of the road."},"159":{"dur":1,"text":"Answer the phone and I said, yes sir."},"162":{"dur":1,"text":"And he said how are you doing Michelle?"},"164":{"dur":1,"text":"I said, I'm, I'm doing okay."},"165":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a little tough right now, you know,\nbut I'm hanging in there."},"168":{"dur":2,"text":"And he's like, he's like, that's good."},"170":{"dur":4,"text":"He said, I, I'm calling to give you some\nadvice."},"175":{"dur":1,"text":"And I said, okay, I am ready."},"177":{"dur":3,"text":"And he said there are two things that I\nwanna communicate to you tonight."},"180":{"dur":3,"text":"I said okay, I'm, I'm ready, let's go."},"184":{"dur":2,"text":"He said the first one, he said, do you\nhave a boyfriend?"},"186":{"dur":0,"text":">> [LAUGH]"},"187":{"dur":2,"text":">> And I said no, cuz at the time I did\nnot."},"190":{"dur":3,"text":"And he said okay, so my first piece of\nadvice is go out and get one."},"193":{"dur":3,"text":">> [LAUGH]\n>> And I said, okay."},"197":{"dur":5,"text":"I did not think that I would ever be\ngetting love life advice from Joel Klein."},"202":{"dur":3,"text":"So I was sorta hesitatingly you know,\nsorta said, oh, okay sir."},"205":{"dur":3,"text":"And he said, here's what you need to\nunderstand."},"208":{"dur":4,"text":"He said, this job is one of the loneliest\njobs you can possibly have."},"213":{"dur":3,"text":"He said, everyday is just an absolute\ngrind."},"216":{"dur":4,"text":"He said, I would never be able to do what\nI do everyday if I"},"220":{"dur":1,"text":"didn't have my wife at home."},"221":{"dur":3,"text":"Because at the end of every tough day I\nget in to bed and"},"225":{"dur":3,"text":"she goes, baby don't worry about it."},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"She's like, you're not the crazy one."},"230":{"dur":1,"text":"They're the crazy ones."},"232":{"dur":1,"text":">> [LAUGH]"},"233":{"dur":2,"text":">> He said, if I didn't have that\ngrounding me everyday,"},"236":{"dur":3,"text":"I would not be able to wake up every\nmorning and go to work."},"239":{"dur":4,"text":"He said, so my first piece of advice is go\nand find a boyfriend."},"243":{"dur":0,"text":"I said, okay."},"244":{"dur":3,"text":"I actually meanwhile did do that and\nhappily."},"248":{"dur":1,"text":"So I listened to that piece."},"250":{"dur":3,"text":"And then, the second thing he said, he\nsorta got really quiet and serious."},"253":{"dur":1,"text":"And he said."},"254":{"dur":1,"text":"So here's my second thing."},"255":{"dur":2,"text":"He said, you have to lead from the front."},"258":{"dur":7,"text":"And he said it with such conviction and\nconfidence that I said, okay, I got it."},"266":{"dur":3,"text":"And I hung up the phone, and I pulled back\nonto the road."},"270":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'm thinking."},"271":{"dur":2,"text":"I have no idea what that means, right?"},"273":{"dur":0,"text":"But I didn't wanna,"},"274":{"dur":3,"text":"I didn't wanna ask him any questions cuz I\ndidn't wanna seem like I was stupid."},"277":{"dur":1,"text":"So, you know, I'd get back on the road."},"279":{"dur":3,"text":"And it actually wasn't until several\nmonths later that I had"},"282":{"dur":4,"text":"sorta lived through a lot of the turmoil\nof, of the, of being the chancellor."},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"That I actually realized what he meant."},"289":{"dur":0,"text":"Right?"},"290":{"dur":3,"text":"Because when you are a leader, sometimes\nyou've gotta be out in front."},"293":{"dur":4,"text":"You can see things that, that other people\ncan't see at the time."},"298":{"dur":4,"text":"And if you get mired in the, the muck, if\nyou sorta get you know,"},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"pulled into every single argument on one\nside or another."},"305":{"dur":4,"text":"You're actually not gonna be able to move\nyour organization as far as you can,"},"309":{"dur":1,"text":"as fast as you can."},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"So when he gave me that piece of advice,"},"313":{"dur":3,"text":"I was actually in the middle of our school\nclosure process."},"317":{"dur":1,"text":"Which was incredibly painful."},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, we had 144 schools, we were\nclosing 23 of them."},"321":{"dur":1,"text":"It was 15% of the schools."},"323":{"dur":3,"text":"And if you ever wanna quickly become the\nmost unpopular person in"},"327":{"dur":4,"text":"a city all you have to do is tell somebody\nthat you are closing a school."},"331":{"dur":1,"text":"Much less 23 schools."},"332":{"dur":1,"text":"So I was in the middle of this and"},"333":{"dur":3,"text":"it was, it was this tremendous amount of\nopposition push back."},"337":{"dur":4,"text":"And the interesting this was, about a year\nafter we closed the schools and"},"342":{"dur":0,"text":"we went through that process."},"343":{"dur":3,"text":"I was in one of the schools that had been\nconsolidated."},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was trying to check out you know,\nwhat the situation was."},"349":{"dur":0,"text":"A women came up to me."},"351":{"dur":3,"text":"She said, hey, hey, hey look at me, you\nrecognize me."},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"She said I was the one last year that was\nalways screaming at"},"357":{"dur":1,"text":"you about closing schools."},"359":{"dur":1,"text":"I said, oh yeah, I know who you are."},"360":{"dur":3,"text":">> [LAUGH]\n>> I could never forget that face."},"363":{"dur":1,"text":"She's like you know what?"},"365":{"dur":1,"text":"I just wanted to let you know you were\nright."},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"She said I didn't, I didn't, we couldn't\nsee it at the time."},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"Because it was such an emotional and\nsentimental process for"},"372":{"dur":3,"text":"us and we were just angry at you and you\nknow, this whole process."},"376":{"dur":1,"text":"She's like, but now I get it."},"378":{"dur":1,"text":"Cuz we're in this school, and"},"379":{"dur":4,"text":"this school has a lot more resources, our\nkids are getting a better education."},"383":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'm good."},"385":{"dur":2,"text":">> [LAUGH]\n>> And she walks away."},"387":{"dur":2,"text":">> And I'm thinking, where's the\nWashington Post when this kinda"},"390":{"dur":1,"text":"stuff happens, right?"},"391":{"dur":3,"text":"But what I realize is this, we were, we\nwere able to,"},"395":{"dur":5,"text":"because we made the incredibly tough\ndecision to close those schools."},"400":{"dur":3,"text":"We were able to create a new reality for\nthe children in Washington DC."},"404":{"dur":4,"text":"Because of that decision, we were able to\nprovide an art music, an art teacher,"},"408":{"dur":3,"text":"a music teacher, a PE teacher, a\nlibrarian, a nurse."},"412":{"dur":1,"text":"And a social worker or"},"413":{"dur":3,"text":"a guidance counselor at every single\nschool in the city."},"417":{"dur":2,"text":"For the first time in the history,"},"419":{"dur":3,"text":"that anybody could ever remember, we\nequalized the resources."},"423":{"dur":2,"text":"So that having an art teacher wasn't\ndependent on whether you,"},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"you know, were at one of the schools that\nhad wealthier parents."},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"And they could hold an auction to hire the\nteacher, etc."},"431":{"dur":1,"text":"We equalized the playing field for"},"433":{"dur":5,"text":"all of the kids as it pertained to the\nkinds of curriculum that they should have."},"438":{"dur":3,"text":"And had we got caught up in all of the\nsorta emotion and, and"},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"the sorta opposition and whatnot."},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"We would not have been able to follow\nthrough on that decision."},"447":{"dur":3,"text":"And we could not have provided the kids\nwith those additional resources."},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's my first message is sometimes,\nyou gotta lead from the front."},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"My second, observation."},"457":{"dur":4,"text":"[COUGH] And, and, you could, you could\neither take my advice or not on this one."},"462":{"dur":4,"text":"But I believe very strongly that in order\nto be an effective leader,"},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"you have to be okay with not being liked."},"471":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'm like really really good at this\none."},"472":{"dur":0,"text":">> [LAUGH]\n>> So"},"473":{"dur":3,"text":"you can, you can, you can, you can take my\nadvice."},"476":{"dur":7,"text":"I, I remember very clearly about halfway\nthrough my second year as chancellor."},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"A columnist for the Washington Post wrote\na piece."},"488":{"dur":3,"text":"And it was sorta you know, I like Michelle\nRhee."},"492":{"dur":4,"text":"She is doing, you know, good things and\nmaking hard decisions."},"496":{"dur":1,"text":"I just wish."},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"She would be a little nicer."},"499":{"dur":1,"text":"So I read the piece and I'm pissed off."},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"So I call the guy and I'm like what are\nyou doing?"},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"And he's like, no you don't understand."},"505":{"dur":4,"text":"He's like I, I want you to be here for the\nlong haul, I think you are good for"},"509":{"dur":4,"text":"He said, but in order for you to be here,\npeople got to like you a little bit more."},"514":{"dur":4,"text":"You could be a little friendlier and\nnicer."},"519":{"dur":5,"text":"And I look and you know so I said to him I\nsaid look you have to figure out what you"},"524":{"dur":5,"text":"think the most important characteristics\nof a schools chancellor are."},"530":{"dur":5,"text":"And quite frankly if its sorta personality\ndriven then you know and"},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"you want warm and fuzzy."},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"Then I am not your girl."},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"And you should actually be advocating for\nmy ouster."},"542":{"dur":5,"text":"But if you like what is going on in the\nschools, if you believe sincerely"},"547":{"dur":4,"text":"that the right decisions are being made in\nthe interests of kids."},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"Then you should not be saying Michelle\nreally needs to change her personality."},"555":{"dur":3,"text":"You should be advocating that we kinda\nleave the personalities aside and"},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"focus on the policies of what's actually\nhappening in the schools."},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I say this because you know,"},"565":{"dur":4,"text":"when I was in my first year as a\nchancellor my mother came to town."},"569":{"dur":1,"text":"So, when your mom comes to town,"},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"yo, you got a whole different perspective\non things."},"573":{"dur":5,"text":"So, my mom happened to come at a time\nwhere people were very, very angry at me."},"579":{"dur":3,"text":"And so she comes into town, it was all on\nthe school closure stuff."},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"And she, you know, opens up the Washington\nPost."},"585":{"dur":3,"text":"There's a two-page spread on, you know,\nall the different schools that I'm"},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"closing, like, can point it all over the\ncity."},"591":{"dur":3,"text":"She turns on the TV, there are people,\nlike, you know,"},"594":{"dur":3,"text":"throwing things at me at a meeting, and\nthat sorta thing."},"598":{"dur":3,"text":"She [LAUGH] she, over the weekend said,\nthey're."},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah, there's some really loud"},"605":{"dur":3,"text":"people down the block who are picketing\nabout something."},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"And I said, yeah, they're picketing me."},"610":{"dur":0,"text":"She's like, oh my gosh."},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"I can't believe this is going on."},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"So anyways, one night at the end of"},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"a long night of community meetings that I\nwas having."},"619":{"dur":1,"text":"I come home, I'm in the kitchen,"},"621":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm making myself a peanut better an jelly\nsandwich."},"623":{"dur":5,"text":"My mother sorta creeps into the kitchen,\nand she says are you okay?"},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"And I say yeah I'm fine I'm good."},"629":{"dur":1,"text":"And she looks at me, she goes you know,"},"631":{"dur":6,"text":"when you were little you never used to\ncare what people thought about you."},"637":{"dur":0,"text":"She's like, and so"},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"I always thought that you were going to\ngrow up to be really antisocial."},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"But I see now that this is serving you\nwell."},"643":{"dur":4,"text":">> [LAUGH]\n>> And I said yes, it was."},"648":{"dur":5,"text":"Because the bottom line is that if you are\nconcerned in too"},"653":{"dur":1,"text":"strong a way with being liked."},"655":{"dur":5,"text":"With whether or not you're popular, with\nwhat your polling numbers look like, etc."},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"Then you're gonna make a different set of\ndecisions."},"664":{"dur":5,"text":"And the bottom line is that no really\nsignificant change comes"},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"without some pretty significant pushback\nand opposition as well."},"673":{"dur":1,"text":"And at the end of the day,"},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"if the decisions that you're making are\nthe ones that you believe are right."},"677":{"dur":4,"text":"And you, you, you, you, you, you have the\nconfidence of that."},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"Then you have to be okay getting that\nopposition,"},"684":{"dur":3,"text":"getting the criticism and, at the end of\nthe day, not being liked so much."},"688":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's my second piece of advice."},"691":{"dur":6,"text":"My third is actually about my boss at the\ntime when I was in D.C., Adrian Fenty."},"698":{"dur":4,"text":"Who was the mayor of D.C. and he's the\nperson that I reported to."},"702":{"dur":5,"text":"And in my opinion, he is the person\nwithout whom none"},"708":{"dur":3,"text":"of what we did in DC could have happened."},"711":{"dur":3,"text":"He was an extraordinarily unique\npolitician."},"714":{"dur":4,"text":"In that when he hired me he said, all I\nwant you to do is make the schools better."},"721":{"dur":4,"text":"Make the schools a place where we wanna\nsend our own children every day."},"725":{"dur":3,"text":"In terms of politics and the pushback and\nwhat, I'll handle that."},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"But we're not gonna worry about it."},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"Because at the end of the day, we're gonna\nmake every decision within what we"},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"believe is in the best interests of kids."},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"He said that on Day 1 to me."},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"And of all the crazy things that happened\nto me in DC,"},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"actually, none of that was particularly\nsurprising."},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"The one thing that I would say was\nsurprising to me is the fact that"},"747":{"dur":3,"text":"that man never wavered one time."},"750":{"dur":1,"text":"In fact, this is a quick story."},"753":{"dur":7,"text":"His primary election, was in September of\n2010."},"761":{"dur":6,"text":"And in August, we had just implemented a\nnew teacher evaluation system."},"767":{"dur":3,"text":"Where for the first time, we were\nevaluating teachers based in part on"},"771":{"dur":4,"text":"whether or not their student achievement\nlevels had grown in the school."},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we had identified a couple hundred\npeople who were,"},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"who were categorized as ineffective."},"781":{"dur":6,"text":"And based on the, the framework and the\nstructure that we had set out."},"788":{"dur":3,"text":"We said that those people who had been\nrated as ineffective after their first"},"791":{"dur":1,"text":"year were subject to termination."},"794":{"dur":2,"text":"But this is weeks away from his primary\nelection."},"796":{"dur":1,"text":"So I call the man and I say, okay mayor,\nso"},"798":{"dur":3,"text":"here's where we are and reminded him about\nthe new evaluation system."},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"I said, you know the decision is whether\nwe"},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"actually move forward with this\nterminations or not."},"808":{"dur":4,"text":"Because at the end of the day I am very\nsensitive to the fact that"},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"you've got a race coming up."},"814":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't want to do anything to jeopardize\nyour ability to,"},"817":{"dur":3,"text":"to you know, run the city effectively,\netc."},"820":{"dur":1,"text":"And he said let me ask you a question."},"822":{"dur":5,"text":"He said, if we take this action, will that\nensure that"},"827":{"dur":4,"text":"kids in D.C. have better teachers in, come\nfall?"},"832":{"dur":0,"text":"He said then we gotta do it."},"833":{"dur":1,"text":"I said, really?"},"835":{"dur":0,"text":"He said, absolutely."},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"Because every other political calculus\nthat we make [NOISE] we"},"839":{"dur":1,"text":"don't know what the outcome is gonna be."},"840":{"dur":0,"text":"Right?\nSo"},"841":{"dur":3,"text":"if we don't make this decision does that\nmean I'm gonna win the election?"},"845":{"dur":0,"text":"Can't, we can't tell."},"847":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's not really at the end of the\nday what matters."},"848":{"dur":0,"text":"It's not why we're here."},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"We're here to make sure that the kids are\ngetting a great education."},"851":{"dur":3,"text":"And if you can tell me that by removing\nthese people and bringing in other ones,"},"855":{"dur":3,"text":"that kids are gonna get a, a good\neducation, then I'm okay with that."},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"So it was exactly the answer that I wanted\nto hear."},"862":{"dur":2,"text":"It was not so much the answer that other\npeople wanted to hear."},"864":{"dur":4,"text":"So we made the decision and you know the\ncity goes nuts, right?"},"868":{"dur":3,"text":"And it, I started getting calls from\npeople, all throughout the city."},"871":{"dur":3,"text":"People who were supporters of the Mayor\nand mine saying, are you insane?"},"875":{"dur":2,"text":"This is political suicide."},"877":{"dur":4,"text":"You can't fire a bunch of people weeks\nbefore the election."},"882":{"dur":3,"text":"And it was amazing to me how despite the\nfact that he was"},"885":{"dur":5,"text":"being told that his political career was\npotentially gonna end with this decision."},"890":{"dur":5,"text":"The ease and the confidence with which he\nmade it, because he knew that, at,"},"895":{"dur":4,"text":"at the end of the day, it was the right\npolicy decision to make."},"900":{"dur":5,"text":"I wish I could say the same for\npoliticians across this county, and"},"905":{"dur":3,"text":"elected officials across this country."},"908":{"dur":4,"text":"We live in a state where there is,"},"912":{"dur":3,"text":"to say a lack of political courage is an\nunderstatement."},"916":{"dur":3,"text":"We live in a state where not too many\nmonths ago,"},"919":{"dur":4,"text":"when it was found that in an L.A. USD in\nLos Angeles, there was"},"924":{"dur":5,"text":"a teacher who had been a sexual predator,\nkind of molesting kids and et cetera."},"930":{"dur":6,"text":"A state assemblyman from L.A. introduced a\npiece of legislation and"},"936":{"dur":3,"text":"all it would have done is made it easier\nfor"},"939":{"dur":4,"text":"school districts to fire people were\nsexual predators."},"944":{"dur":3,"text":"That's a pretty low bar in my opinion,"},"947":{"dur":3,"text":"that bill didn't even make it out of\ncommittee."},"951":{"dur":4,"text":"Couldn't even go to the floor of the\nlegislature for a vote, because the status"},"956":{"dur":4,"text":"quo people, and, you know, folks who\nwanted to defend, you know, the adult"},"960":{"dur":5,"text":"interests etc said to the politicians,\ndon't vote for this, etc, etc."},"965":{"dur":3,"text":"Couldn't even get a bill like that out of\ncommittee."},"970":{"dur":4,"text":"Couple of weeks ago, we had a similar\nsituation where"},"975":{"dur":5,"text":"a legislator introduced a bill around\nteacher evaluation in the state."},"980":{"dur":2,"text":"It was a very very low key bill."},"983":{"dur":1,"text":"It just said three things."},"985":{"dur":4,"text":"One that parents and the community should\nhave input into the evaluation."},"991":{"dur":3,"text":"Two, that we should evaluate teachers and\nput them into four"},"994":{"dur":4,"text":"different performance bands as opposed to\njust satisfactory or unsatisfactory."},"999":{"dur":4,"text":"And that for veteran teachers, we would\nmove the timeframe."},"1004":{"dur":4,"text":"So instead of a evaluating them once every\nfive years,"},"1008":{"dur":1,"text":"we could evaluate them once every three\nyears."},"1013":{"dur":4,"text":"The committee vote of nine committee\nmembers, six of them abstained."},"1021":{"dur":1,"text":"Abstained."},"1022":{"dur":2,"text":"Which is, to me, I was like, look, if you\ndon't like the bill for"},"1024":{"dur":1,"text":"whatever reason, then vote against it."},"1026":{"dur":2,"text":"But what are, what's abstaining all

to"},"1553":{"dur":3,"text":"three decades in this country, we have\nmore than doubled, and"},"1556":{"dur":3,"text":"almost tripled the amount of money that we\nare spending per kid in public
