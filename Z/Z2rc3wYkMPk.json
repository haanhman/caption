this."},"103":{"dur":2,"text":"So we wanted them to have\nagency in a physical space."},"106":{"dur":4,"text":"So think lights, sound,\nmanipulating things."},"110":{"dur":5,"text":"We want them to have it\nthrough communication."},"115":{"dur":3,"text":"So they get to talk to\ncharacters, to each other,"},"118":{"dur":3,"text":"to the live audience,\neven, at some point,"},"122":{"dur":3,"text":"and really change the story--\nbe part of it-- be in it."},"125":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, over their\nperspective-- which,"},"128":{"dur":1,"text":"in this case,

our work, as I said,"},"174":{"dur":2,"text":"our audiences get to do that."},"177":{"dur":4,"text":"In this case, the\naudience in this space"},"181":{"dur":3,"text":"became part of this\nsecretive movement"},"184":{"dur":2,"text":"called the \"positive vision\nmovement,\" in which they"},"187":{"dur":2,"text":"started to see the future."},"190":{"dur":2,"text":"The audience online went\nthrough a similar but different"},"193":{"dur":3,"text":"experience and started\nseeing characters"},"196":{"dur":2,"text":"that would become important\nin the live experience"},"199":{"dur":3,"text":"before the audience online and\nstarted connecting with those."},"203":{"dur":1,"text":"So agency through communication."},"205":{"dur":2,"text":"We tried a lot of different\nforms of communication."},"209":{"dur":2,"text":"There was a place\nwhere the audience"},"211":{"dur":1,"text":"could speak to each other."},"213":{"dur":2,"text":"There was a lot of\ndirect address to camera."},"217":{"dur":5,"text":"There were backstage\nand other narratives,"},"223":{"dur":3,"text":"that you could explore, that fed\ninto the main narrative, later."},"226":{"dur":2,"text":"So a lot of levels\nof communication."},"228":{"dur":3,"text":"And this led to a really\nsocial experience."},"232":{"dur":1,"text":"And we'll come back\nto that, later."},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"But that's one of\nthe key findings, is,"},"237":{"dur":5,"text":"once theatre and stories become\nsocial-- because they are live,"},"242":{"dur":2,"text":"and the audience is connected--\nthat's where it gets really"},"245":{"dur":0,"text":"exciting."},"246":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is what the\nwebsite looked like."},"249":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's got a main\nvideo-viewing window."},"251":{"dur":3,"text":"And we did we produce a sort of\nedited mix of the story of what"},"255":{"dur":1,"text":"was going on in the live space."},"257":{"dur":2,"text":"And actors could,\nsometimes, directly"},"259":{"dur":1,"text":"address the online audience."},"261":{"dur":0,"text":"And sometimes you\nwere watching it"},"262":{"dur":1,"text":"rather like a proscenium arch."},"263":{"dur":1,"text":"And we're cutting between that."},"264":{"dur":1,"text":"We're using a video director."},"266":{"dur":1,"text":"So you could just\nwatch it, a bit"},"268":{"dur":2,"text":"like watching a streamed play."},"270":{"dur":4,"text":"But we added these extra\nbuttons of roving cameras, that"},"274":{"dur":1,"text":"were following\nparticular characters--"},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"or a particular member of the\naudience-- around the space."},"278":{"dur":2,"text":"And you could choose\nto follow those."},"280":{"dur":3,"text":"We attached cameras\nto a commentary, which"},"284":{"dur":3,"text":"was, basically another\nfictional character, who's"},"287":{"dur":1,"text":"a bit like a social\nanthropologist,"},"289":{"dur":1,"text":"commenting on what\nthe hell you think"},"290":{"dur":1,"text":"is going on, in this space."},"292":{"dur":1,"text":"And we also had an\naudience cam, that's"},"294":{"dur":2,"text":"a roving one, that you\ncould-- through the chat room"},"296":{"dur":1,"text":"that you see, there--\nyou could suggest"},"298":{"dur":1,"text":"where the camera should go."},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"And we obviously\nhave that chat room,"},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's moderated with\na writer-- who, again,"},"306":{"dur":2,"text":"is a kind of-- he's a\nreal person, but also as"},"308":{"dur":0,"text":"a character."},"309":{"dur":1,"text":"And we also had a\nsecret camera that you"},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"had to unlock by\nfinding the button,"},"314":{"dur":1,"text":"or finding a place to\nunlock that button."},"315":{"dur":1,"text":"And inside that was\nanother chat room."},"317":{"dur":1,"text":"So we had all these\ndifferent levels"},"319":{"dur":2,"text":"of choices you can make\nabout doing nothing"},"321":{"dur":3,"text":"but just watch, or\nwatch and chat, or start"},"324":{"dur":2,"text":"to explore, and maybe

here."},"331":{"dur":1,"text":"So it was quite a\ncomplicated system."},"335":{"dur":4,"text":"And we did it inside a\nVictorian greenhouse-- orangery."},"339":{"dur":1,"text":"So a complete, sort\nof, [? dome-- ?]"},"341":{"dur":1,"text":"not a digital studio."},"343":{"dur":0,"text":"So we had to set up."},"344":{"dur":2,"text":"And we divided it\ninto various spaces."},"346":{"dur":5,"text":"So, from there, the live\naudience comes into here,"},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"plays a few games [? in ?]\n[? profiling ?] experiments."},"355":{"dur":1,"text":"They go into a\nmiddle space, where"},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"there's an automatic writing,\nand there's a rather ghostly"},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"sense that the online audience\ncan participate with them,"},"362":{"dur":1,"text":"in producing an image."},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"And then you go into a third\nspace, where you sort of join"},"366":{"dur":1,"text":"the cult, as it\nwere, altogether."},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"[ANNETTE LAUGHS]"},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"So the interesting thing\nabout dividing the space"},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"is you can create different\nmoods in the different spaces."},"374":{"dur":1,"text":"So, again, that\nmeant that you might"},"375":{"dur":1,"text":"want to explore one\nspace, more than another."},"378":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a sense, as well, that\nit's a model that, then, could"},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"be applied to a house-- that\nsome people are in the bedroom,"},"383":{"dur":1,"text":"while some people\nare in the kitchen."},"385":{"dur":1,"text":"And it could be\napplied to the idea"},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"that each one of those spaces\nmay be in a different country."},"389":{"dur":3,"text":"So, as a model, it's quite an\ninteresting model to play with."},"394":{"dur":2,"text":"In terms of technology,\nit was absolute mayhem"},"396":{"dur":3,"text":"to put it all together--\nin this space where"},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"there was no\ncabling, or anything."},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"We had to bring everything\nof our own into the space."},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"What you're looking at,\nhere, is, basically,"},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"that the red blobs are cameras."},"409":{"dur":3,"text":"And some of them are\nroving around the space."},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"The orange blobs are sound\nsources, from the actors."},"416":{"dur":4,"text":"And the blue sources are fixed\nsound sources, from the space."},"421":{"dur":3,"text":"And that immediately provokes\nan interesting creative thought,"},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"which is that the\nsounds-- you know,"},"426":{"dur":1,"text":"if you've got live\nsound sources,"},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"and then sound sources that\ncome direct from actors--"},"430":{"dur":1,"text":"and you may even\nhave some coming"},"431":{"dur":3,"text":"from the website-- you've got a\nreal audio-management problem,"},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"for the online audience,\nand for the live audience,"},"437":{"dur":1,"text":"about what they hear."},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"And they have\nconflicting requirements."},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"So, sometimes, the\nlive space wants"},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"to be very dark and noisy."},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"And, at that point,\nfor the web audience,"},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"it's incredibly\nconfusing, 'cause"},"449":{"dur":1,"text":"they can't see what's going on."},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"And they're kind of-- there\njust seems to be a racket."},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"So they want bright lights\nand sort of a bit of quiet,"},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"to be able to-- clarity."},"456":{"dur":3,"text":"So you have tension, between the\ndemands of the two audiences,"},"459":{"dur":1,"text":"that this technology does."},"461":{"dur":1,"text":"And you can see, we had\nto have a sound desk,"},"463":{"dur":1,"text":"a video desk, a\nweb-streaming thing."},"465":{"dur":3,"text":"So we had to learn a lot\nof skills, really fast."},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"So we kind of threw the\nkitchen sink at this,"},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"rather than paring down."},"472":{"dur":3,"text":"We thought we'd try everything\nand see what came out."},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"So we were in that\nspace for a month."},"480":{"dur":1,"text":"And we had open rehearsals."},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"We had open beta testing."},"483":{"dur":3,"text":"We had three R&D showings of\nthe actual 45-minute theatrical"},"487":{"dur":0,"text":"performance."},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"So we just kept running\nit, again and again,"},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"trying to get it to be more\nand more robust, as a system,"},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"to build up more and\nmore audience interest"},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"and engagement,\nas we went along."},"499":{"dur":1,"text":"Dropped the things\nthat didn't work,"},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"reinforced the things\nwe did think would work."},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"So, a sort of iterative\ndevelopment process."},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"But, as you can see, it\nwas such a hybrid system--"},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"that it was a\nlive-streaming platform."},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"It was slightly gamelike."},"515":{"dur":1,"text":"It was a social system."},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"As an exercise in\nhow to wire a space,"},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"it was quite interesting."},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, we were also doing\nmore traditional things"},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"of putting up a website,\nputting up a Twitter account."},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"So there was a lot going on."},"531":{"dur":1,"text":"In terms of promotion--\nwe were asked"},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"to talk about this-- is\nthat we didn't promote that"},"535":{"dur":3,"text":"aggressively, because we weren't\nlooking for really big numbers."},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, even at the-- but\nit's interesting to note"},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"that we did build a website,\na Facebook page, a Twitter"},"543":{"dur":1,"text":"account, a YouTube\naccount, [? EventBrite-- ?]"},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"that, when you say\nyou didn't do much,"},"547":{"dur":1,"text":"that's the sort of base level."},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"So you have to do quite\na lot, to engage--"},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"get an online audience\nto come along."},"554":{"dur":1,"text":"We have to say that\nthe Nesta press"},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"release and Nesta connections\nand partners and mailing"},"558":{"dur":1,"text":"out was invaluable,\nto getting people"},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"to come along and get attention."},"563":{"dur":1,"text":"But we wanted to keep\nthe numbers manageable,"},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"mainly because we\nhad a very flaky tech"},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"setup that would fall over,\nif too many people came"},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"at it, all at once, and we\nwanted to scale that up."},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"So we didn't want to stress\nthe system, straightaway."},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"Definitely don't\nwant to do that."},"576":{"dur":3,"text":"But we also wanted to\nconcentrate on the sort"},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"of behaviours of the audience."},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"So that didn't\nneed large numbers."},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"You just needed a significant\nnumber-- maybe even"},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"a dozen people-- to do\nsomething, and go, ooh,"},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"they like that, or, oh\ngod, they hate that."},"590":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's more about the\nquality of the research"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"that you're getting out of\nit, rather than big numbers,"},"595":{"dur":0,"text":"at that point."},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"So, basically, what\nwe came out with is"},"603":{"dur":1,"text":"a minimum viable platform."},"605":{"dur":1,"text":"So, what does it\nneed, minimally,"},"607":{"dur":3,"text":"to create something that's\nengaging, live, online?"},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"What is that thing that\nan audience can show up"},"612":{"dur":4,"text":"for that has enough choice\nand enough excitement"},"617":{"dur":1,"text":"to keep them there?"},"620":{"dur":3,"text":"And then we looked at\ntechnology quite modularly."},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"So what happens if you add\nthe cost of multiple roaming"},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"What happens if you've\ngot fixed camera?"},"629":{"dur":1,"text":"What kind of story works\nwith what technology?"},"632":{"dur":1,"text":"Key moments of agency."},"634":{"dur":4,"text":"So, in essence, we find out\nwhat is really, really exciting."},"638":{"dur":1,"text":"The secret camera's exciting."},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"The idea that an actor\nshows up in a place where"},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"he shouldn't be."},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"There was this real moment,\nthere, where there was frisson,"},"648":{"dur":1,"text":"and the audience went mental."},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"All the chat rooms went mental."},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"People started moving\nbetween spaces,"},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"because they wanted\nto bring people over."},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"And it became this\nreally, sort of,"},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"buzzing, alive space, online."},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"Working with and sometimes\ncontrolling the actors"},"665":{"dur":1,"text":"was real exciting."},"666":{"dur":3,"text":"When people saw actors do\nthings that they talked about,"},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"with them, earlier, it felt--\npeople got insanely excited"},"673":{"dur":0,"text":"about that."},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"Especially, weirdly,\nbecause it's far away."},"678":{"dur":1,"text":"Because, normally, in\ninteractive theatre,"},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"you can talk to an actor,\nand something might happen."},"682":{"dur":1,"text":"But that's more like\na normal conversation."},"684":{"dur":3,"text":"This is more like playing\nGod over the real world."},"687":{"dur":3,"text":"It was really, real exciting."},"690":{"dur":3,"text":"And when the story\nreally diverged-- so,"},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"something was happening,\nin that room, which"},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"would affect that room,\nlater, over there,"},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"and people started\nsharing that information."},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"And, again, sort of pulling\nthese things together"},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"is where it got really,\nreally exciting."},"707":{"dur":1,"text":"So, as a digital\nproject manager,"},"708":{"dur":1,"text":"I should talk about\nwhat didn't work."},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"[ANNETTE LAUGHS]"},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"The technology was quite flaky,\nbecause we did everything"},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"It was a real DIY."},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a tribute, actually, to\nboth our partners-- Goldsmiths"},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"and ShowCaster-- that they\nput this thing together."},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, right down\nto the last cable"},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"and finding where\nto plug things in."},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, it was really\ninsanely complicated."},"732":{"dur":1,"text":"And we didn't queue\nenough time in,"},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"for fixing and for\ntesting and fixing."},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"We were, basically,\ntesting in performance."},"740":{"dur":3,"text":"Which, then, makes you look not\nvery professional, sometimes."},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"But I think that may be part\nof the point, about some"},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"of these hybrid digital arts\nprojects-- is that you are"},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"going to be doing that,\nin the experimental space."},"751":{"dur":1,"text":"I think artists,\nquite often, are"},"753":{"dur":1,"text":"used to a private\nrehearsal, and then very,"},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"sort of, glossy performance,\nwhereas software developers are"},"757":{"dur":2,"text":"quite interested in the idea\nof [? virtual ?] development."},"760":{"dur":1,"text":"Of, we put this up,\nit breaks, and then"},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"we fix it, sort of thing."},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's a culture clash,\nthere, that has to be resolved,"},"765":{"dur":0,"text":"I think."},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"Just the basic technology\nacknowledgement"},"769":{"dur":3,"text":"that people out there have\nlots of different kinds"},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"of computers and internet\naccess packages, and stuff."},"776":{"dur":2,"text":"Trying to support\neverybody is a nightmare."},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"You've got some people who are\ntrying to look at this show"},"782":{"dur":3,"text":"through a phone, on a very\nnarrow internet access,"},"785":{"dur":1,"text":"with a Chrome\nbrowser, or something."},"786":{"dur":1,"text":"And then you've got\nsome other people"},"788":{"dur":1,"text":"who have got the latest,\ngreatest Macintosh,"},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"with Safari and high speed,\nand everything in between."},"792":{"dur":1,"text":"So getting your software\nto work for everybody"},"794":{"dur":1,"text":"is really, really hard."},"797":{"dur":1,"text":"And maybe you need to\nstandardise the platform"},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"and say, to everybody, this\nis the setup that you've got."},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, on the\ncontent side, I think"},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"we were quite loyal\nto linear narrative."},"807":{"dur":4,"text":"We were not-- that we\ndidn't reflect the fact"},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"that, if we might build\nthe platform and say,"},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"we've got a device; now,\nlet's put a story into it."},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"We said we had a story,\nand then we sort of"},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"get the platform to\ntry and support it."},"822":{"dur":1,"text":"So whether you start\nwith tech or story,"},"824":{"dur":1,"text":"it's quite a big\ndecision, I think."},"827":{"dur":2,"text":"And two basic
