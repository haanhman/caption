Like I was nine years old and I walked\ninto my Sunday School class actually at church"},"246":{"dur":5,"text":"and I saw this kid that I knew named Aaron.\nAnd Aaron was wearing this, this lime green"},"252":{"dur":6,"text":"travel soccer team uniform.

But the funny thing"},"307":{"dur":7,"text":"for me is that in this particular instance\nit actually never did, because literally the"},"314":{"dur":6,"text":"exact same week that I was supposed to try\nout for this, this travel soccer team, I woke"},"321":{"dur":5,"text":"up from a biopsy because I'd been having this\nlike pain in my leg. And I'll never forget"},"326":{"dur":3,"text":"it, I'm waking up and I'm sure some of you\nguys have been under anesthesia at some point,"},"330":{"dur":4,"text":"and I'm waking up and sort of groggy and blinking\noff this anesthesia, and my mom and my dad"},"335":{"dur":5,"text":"walked into the room and they stood on the\nleft side of my bed and my dad looked down"},"341":{"dur":8,"text":"at me and he said, \"Joshua, the doctors, the\ndoctors found cancer in your leg.\" And they"},"349":{"dur":7,"text":"told me that I had a 50 percent chance to\nlive. Like I said, I was nine years old. I"},"357":{"dur":6,"text":"started chemotherapy. I lost my hair, which\nat that time was a really big deal for me,"},"364":{"dur":5,"text":"like I was very like meticulous at a young\nage about combing my hair. I would sort of"},"369":{"dur":5,"text":"like use like half a bottle of gel and like\nslick it back like a 1950's movie star or"},"375":{"dur":3,"text":"something. And I always used, I don't know\nif you guys are much into hair care products,"},"378":{"dur":6,"text":"but I used not just any gel. I used L.A. Looks\ngel. Yeah, like level 5, most extreme hold,"},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"the red kind with all of the bubbles in it.\nI would get it at the Dollar Store. It was"},"388":{"dur":5,"text":"awesome. So then for me to like lose my hair\nwas this sort of really, like really devastating"},"394":{"dur":4,"text":"thing for me as a nine year old and furthermore\nto sort of lose everything that I had come"},"398":{"dur":6,"text":"to know as my life because I had no energy.\nI spent one week out of every three in the"},"404":{"dur":5,"text":"hospital.

We were sitting in our"},"423":{"dur":4,"text":"driveway and I was in the back seat of the\nminivan and my mom and my dad were up front."},"428":{"dur":6,"text":"I remember feeling like all of the oxygen\nhad just been like sucked out of the van,"},"434":{"dur":7,"text":"you know, because it was all I could think\nabout was that, you know that lime green travel"},"441":{"dur":10,"text":"soccer team uniform, because I knew that I\nwas never going to wear it. It's like, this"},"451":{"dur":4,"text":"is the way I would describe it to you. You\nknow I think like I'm sure yours is the same"},"456":{"dur":4,"text":"way, but I have in my mind what I imagine\nsort of as a metaphor of this like sort of"},"460":{"dur":4,"text":"photo album of things I imagine are going\nto happen in the future that are going to"},"465":{"dur":5,"text":"be awesome. Like for example right now in\nmy photo album I imagine that on the train"},"470":{"dur":4,"text":"on the way back today, I'm going to watch\nawesome like stuff on my IPad. I'm gonna reply"},"475":{"dur":4,"text":"to a bunch of Tweets. It's gonna be great.\nAnd then this weekend, my brother's coming"},"479":{"dur":4,"text":"into, town, which is gonna be awesome. And\nthen, what's gonna happen after that? Oh,"},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"I just hit 99,000 subscribers yesterday on\nYouTube, which is like really exciting for"},"488":{"dur":5,"text":"me. So very soon I'm gonna hit 100,000 subscribers\nprobably in like three or four days. So that's"},"493":{"dur":4,"text":"gonna be amazing. And then my YouTube channel's\ngonna grow even more and then at some point"},"497":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm becoming very rich and famous as a result\nof YouTube and my book. And then all of the"},"502":{"dur":3,"text":"girls that have ever liked me are gonna write\nme a collective e-mail. It'll be like \"Josh,"},"505":{"dur":4,"text":"we are so sorry.

And\nit's gonna have awesome furniture from IKEA,"},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"because that's my favorite furniture store,\n'cause I'm not a snob. And it's just gonna"},"525":{"dur":5,"text":"be so awesome. Right? That is what I imagine\nin my current photo album of hope. I don't"},"530":{"dur":6,"text":"know what's in yours, maybe something similar.\nBut for me at age nine, that, that photo album,"},"537":{"dur":6,"text":"every. every picture was me wearing this,\nthis soccer uniform. I remember after my parents"},"544":{"dur":6,"text":"told me that I was gonna lose my leg, it was\nlike I went back to that that photo album,"},"550":{"dur":5,"text":"you know to, the way you do sort of on a daily\nbasis to sort of recover from some emotional"},"555":{"dur":5,"text":"problem, right? And I went back to that that\nphoto album and it was just like every, every"},"561":{"dur":10,"text":"page was just blank. It was like everything\nthat I hoped for was seemingly gone. I lost"},"572":{"dur":6,"text":"my leg then probably about four weeks after\nthat conversation. And after I did I was very"},"579":{"dur":7,"text":"sort of eager to [drinking] get back to um,\nto playing sports in some way. And so I remember"},"586":{"dur":7,"text":"I went to about probably a month after I lost\nmy leg I went to play in my church's, we had"},"593":{"dur":3,"text":"this like softball game, this like big annual\nsoftball game. And so I decided I was going"},"597":{"dur":5,"text":"to go play in this, this game. And I remember\nwhen I was supposed to up to bat, I sat my"},"602":{"dur":7,"text":"crutches down on the ground and I hopped over\nto, to home base and I sat there and you have"},"610":{"dur":4,"text":"to know at this point you know I didn't have\nhair of course, so I was wearing a, you know,"},"615":{"dur":4,"text":"a ball cap to cover my my bald head and I\nwas very like thin and and pretty sick and"},"619":{"dur":5,"text":"pretty pale. At that point I weighed just\nover 60 pounds. And I had no balance because"},"625":{"dur":5,"text":"I'd just lost my leg and after you lose your\nleg you have to sort of re, ah, readjust and"},"630":{"dur":6,"text":"relearn your center of balance. So I had to\nlean on the bat as if it were a cane until"},"636":{"dur":5,"text":"Pastor Smuland, who was the pitcher, pitched\nthis ball towards me. And then I waited and"},"642":{"dur":4,"text":"I waited and at the last minute right before\nit came in front of me, I picked the bat up"},"646":{"dur":9,"text":"and I swung and I missed and the bat went\nflying and I fell down on the ground in this"},"656":{"dur":6,"text":"sort of dry, dusty infield. It made me start\ncoughing. But I sat there and then I stood"},"662":{"dur":4,"text":"up and I brushed myself off and I picked up\nthe bat because it was like this game was"},"667":{"dur":6,"text":"a really big deal to me because I wanted to\nprove to, to myself but also like all my friends"},"674":{"dur":4,"text":"from church and my dad who was there like\nwatching from behind the chain link fence,"},"678":{"dur":5,"text":"I wanted to prove to everyone that I, I could\nstill do stuff even though I had one leg."},"684":{"dur":5,"text":"Like I could still play things and play in\nsports just like I did before. So this was"},"689":{"dur":9,"text":"a big moment for me. And the second pitch\ncame and again I swung and I missed. And then"},"699":{"dur":4,"text":"the pitcher, the catcher threw the ball over\nto Pastor Smuland. And I remember this moment"},"703":{"dur":5,"text":"because, let me ask you all, I'm not sure\nif any of you all have children, but what's"},"709":{"dur":5,"text":"what is like the universal advice that you\ngive children who are up to bat? [pause]"},"714":{"dur":4,"text":">>male audience member #4: Keep your eye on\nthe ball."},"718":{"dur":1,"text":">>Josh Sundquist: Keep your eye on the ball.\nExactly. What's your name?"},"719":{"dur":1,"text":">>male audience member #4: Todd."},"720":{"dur":2,"text":">>Josh Sundquist: Todd. Yeah. Keep your eye\non the ball. Right? Always. Everybody, choke"},"723":{"dur":3,"text":"up on the bat. Keep your eye on the ball.\nBoom. You're golden. Right? So, I'm sitting"},"727":{"dur":4,"text":"there and and I remember I, I looked over\nat my dad, who was, as I said, standing behind"},"732":{"dur":8,"text":"the chain link fence, and he said, \"Joshua,\nkeep your eye on the ball.\" So I was like,"},"740":{"dur":6,"text":"alright. So on this third pitch, as it came\ntowards me, I tried to keep my eye on the"},"746":{"dur":11,"text":"ball. And as it came across home base, I swung\nand I missed. And I, I fell down in the dirt"},"757":{"dur":7,"text":"and then I picked up my crutches and I started\nto, to walk off the field. And as I did, I"},"765":{"dur":6,"text":"heard Pastor Smuland, he yelled at me, he's\nlike, \"Where're you going?\" And I was like,"},"771":{"dur":7,"text":"\"Well I, I struck out.\" And Pastor Smuland\nyelled back at me. He's like, \"We're Protestants,"},"779":{"dur":7,"text":"brother. We play by grace not by the law.\"\nAnd I was like, what? What is a Protestant?"},"787":{"dur":3,"text":"I do not understand what you are saying to\nme. But it was like all of the adults were"},"790":{"dur":5,"text":"sort of chuckling and so I figured that this\nmeant I was allowed to keep swinging. So I"},"796":{"dur":5,"text":"went back up and I got another pitch and another\nstrike and another and another and another."},"802":{"dur":7,"text":"And after nine strikes, I started to see my\nvision get blurry. And, like I said, all my"},"810":{"dur":5,"text":"friends from church were there and I couldn't\nlet them see me cry. So again I picked up"},"815":{"dur":6,"text":"my crutches and I started to walk off the\nfield like as fast as I could. But this time"},"821":{"dur":9,"text":"I heard my dad yell at me. He said, \"Joshua,\nyou almost had that last one.\" And I stopped"},"830":{"dur":7,"text":"and I looked over my shoulder at him. And\nmy dad, he put his, his two fingers in between"},"838":{"dur":10,"text":"the openings in this chain link fence and\nhe said, \"It was this close.\" I remember standing"},"848":{"dur":10,"text":"there and looking at him and it was like my\nmy dad was my hero and I knew that if he were"},"859":{"dur":9,"text":"up to bat that he would keep swinging until\nhe got a hit. So I went back up and I picked"},"869":{"dur":5,"text":"up the bat again and another pitch came and\nanother strike and another and another. But"},"874":{"dur":7,"text":"finally on the 13th pitch, I felt the ball\nbounce off the bat and I watched it roll up"},"882":{"dur":8,"text":"the infield and by the time it reached the\nshortstop, my friend Tim, who was my designated"},"890":{"dur":10,"text":"runner, was already on first base. [pause]\nAnd I tell you that story today for two reasons."},"900":{"dur":7,"text":"Number one, because I think that there's nothing\nreally better that that you and I could aspire"},"908":{"dur":10,"text":"to in life than to be like my dad was for\nme that day, to be a hero to someone else."},"919":{"dur":8,"text":"But secondly because, if you think about it,\nthat softball game is a lot like life, because"},"927":{"dur":7,"text":"in life, unlike normal softball, you get as\nmany strikes as you want.

Like the story I told you about\nwith Amy Gardner. But the problem is, on the"},"2139":{"dur":3,"text":"flip side, like if I have a story like 'Yeah\nI met this girl. I got her number.
