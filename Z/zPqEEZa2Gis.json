a\nsuperconductor, because it has"},"212":{"dur":2,"text":"electrical resistance, the\ncurrents that are created as"},"215":{"dur":3,"text":"the magnet falls through will\nalways tend to die away."},"219":{"dur":2,"text":"So if the magnet were, for\ninstance, to be stopped by the"},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"electric currents, those\ncurrents would immediately die"},"223":{"dur":1,"text":"away, and the magnet would\nstart falling again."},"225":{"dur":1,"text":"So what actually happens\nis it just falls"},"226":{"dur":2,"text":"slowly through the

there."},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"And we'll get onto\nthe track now."},"256":{"dur":2,"text":"And to do that, we saw, when\nI was demonstrating the"},"258":{"dur":2,"text":"superconductor on the

there."},"322":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's kind of locked\ninto position."},"324":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's not just repelling\nthe magnets and hovering."},"328":{"dur":3,"text":"I can sort of pick it up and\nthen stick it underneath as"},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"well, and it will hang there."},"334":{"dur":1,"text":"So as I mentioned with the\ncopper, when you induce"},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"electric

trying\nto pull it away."},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"So the act of trying to fall\naway from the track sets up a"},"365":{"dur":3,"text":"different sets of currents\nwith a different magnetic"},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"field, which this time are\nattracted to the track."},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"So whichever way you try and\nmove it, whether you're trying"},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"to move it off to the side, up\nand down, towards the track,"},"376":{"dur":3,"text":"away from the track, the\nsuperconductor will resist"},"380":{"dur":3,"text":"that motion, effectively locking\nitself into position"},"383":{"dur":0,"text":"relative to the track."},"384":{"dur":3,"text":"So the only direction it can\nmove is the direction which"},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"the magnetic field doesn't\nchange, i.e."},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"along the track."},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"So basically, the superconductor\ncan be any kind"},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"of magnet it wants to be, or any\nkind of magnet it needs to"},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"be at that moment to keep itself\nin the right position"},"399":{"dur":1,"text":"relative to the track."},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"So this
