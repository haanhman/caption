what is desired and what is\nexperience."},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"And the holidays really bring this to the\nsurface."},"554":{"dur":1,"text":"And I guess the first way that I

of what you choose to do for\nthe holidays."},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"You know Molly asked and some other people\nasked, well, should I even"},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"spend time with my family, it feels

spend"},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"time with them about not, not being the\nsort"},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"of the love fest that you would hope for."},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think it's really

going\nto be part of the holiday experience."},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"And you get to choose as an adult which\nversion of that you want"},"598":{"dur":4,"text":"and what you want to contribute and how\nyou want to engage with reality."},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"You get to choose from your own values."},"606":{"dur":3,"text":"Is it important for you to be with family\nor not?"},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"And to know that you can make that choice\nautonomously, that there"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"is no one who can force you to spend time\nwith your

present."},"622":{"dur":4,"text":"And really have a sense of walking into\nthe situation with awareness of what"},"626":{"dur":4,"text":"you're willing to give, what you would\nlike to give and what you're able to"},"630":{"dur":4,"text":"give to yourself, whether it's acceptance\nor whether it's your own love that you"},"635":{"dur":4,"text":"can give to yourself and, and what it is\nthat you are hoping to experience."},"639":{"dur":4,"text":"And to know that what ever choice that you\nmake, if you're doing it from that point"},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"of view, you can't do it wrong,

can"},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"actually find a place of compassion and\nacceptance for"},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"whatever it is that you yourself are going\nthrough."},"766":{"dur":4,"text":"And one of

the first thing that I want to say\nis it actually is never a good time."},"820":{"dur":1,"text":"One of the, the mistakes that a lot"},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"of people make when it comes to behavior\nchange"},"824":{"dur":2,"text":"is to recognize how challenging a change\nis in"},"827":{"dur":3,"text":"the present moment, because you're aware\nof your

extra, to spend some money or\nto"},"838":{"dur":3,"text":"indulge in food, that all feels very real\nright now."},"842":{"dur":2,"text":"And it often seems like in the

year,"},"881":{"dur":3,"text":"is to actually recruit social support, for\nmaking a change like quitting smoking."},"884":{"dur":2,"text":"And the holidays are a great time to let\npeople"},"887":{"dur":2,"text":"know that this is a gift that they can\ngive you."},"889":{"dur":4,"text":"That during this time of the year, what\nyou need most is some moral

you\naccountable."},"901":{"dur":3,"text":"Or maybe you know that the best gift that\na friend or coworker could give you"},"905":{"dur":3,"text":"is to give you a pep talk when you give in\nand when they catch you smoking."},"910":{"dur":3,"text":"And you can, you should give yourself\npermission to ask for this help."},"913":{"dur":2,"text":"Often we don't tell people we're trying to\nmake a"},"916":{"dur":2,"text":"change, because we aren't sure if we can\ndo it."},"918":{"dur":3,"text":"And we don't want to set ourselves up for\nthe embarrassment of having"},"922":{"dur":3,"text":"not

goal."},"992":{"dur":2,"text":"And actually trust that process, because\ntoo often we"},"994":{"dur":4,"text":"think that quitting smoking means not\nsmoking another
