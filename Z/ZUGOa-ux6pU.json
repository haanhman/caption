the thing that propels you\nto make something out of nothing."},"38":{"dur":3,"text":"But the environment from which you come\ncan have a huge influence"},"42":{"dur":2,"text":"on the manner in which\nyou choose to express your hustle."},"45":{"dur":4,"text":"I come from an environment where\nthe visual landscape was dominated"},"49":{"dur":3,"text":"by drug addicts, winos, and prostitutes."},"54":{"dur":3,"text":"Most of the people there\nlived in distressed, low-income housing"},"58":{"dur":1,"text":"and were either on welfare,"},"60":{"dur":2,"text":"or some other form\nof government assistance."},"63":{"dur":3,"text":"But at the center\nof everything were drugs."},"67":{"dur":3,"text":"Now there were many ambitious minds\nin this environment,"},"71":{"dur":2,"text":"and almost everyone had hustle."},"74":{"dur":3,"text":"But most chose to express their hustle\nin an illegal manner."},"78":{"dur":2,"text":"These were street hustlers."},"81":{"dur":3,"text":"The single most influential person\nin my life, my mother,"},"85":{"dur":1,"text":"was a street hustler."},"87":{"dur":4,"text":"And in the household in which \nI was

money."},"137":{"dur":4,"text":"But the overwhelming majority of my time\nwas spent selling drugs."},"142":{"dur":2,"text":"This is how I chose to express my hustle."},"145":{"dur":3,"text":"But street hustling taught \nme undeniable principles"},"148":{"dur":2,"text":"that at the time, I wasn't even aware of."},"152":{"dur":5,"text":"For instance, I developed an intimate\nunderstanding of products,"},"157":{"dur":4,"text":"and supply and demand, and what it meant\nto satisfy a customer's perceived needs."},"162":{"dur":2,"text":"I also learned valuable lessons"},"165":{"dur":4,"text":"about operations and distribution\nand managing inventory."},"170":{"dur":3,"text":"But this isn't just unique\nto my experience."},"174":{"dur":1,"text":"It's actually pretty common"},"175":{"dur":2,"text":"for street hustlers to pick up\nthese very real principles."},"179":{"dur":3,"text":"Unfortunately, in this environment,"},"183":{"dur":3,"text":"you don't get the time to ponder\non the lessons life teaches you."},"188":{"dur":3,"text":"Now for all of the things you pick up\nin the streets from hustling,"},"192":{"dur":3,"text":"there remains three basic realities."},"195":{"dur":4,"text":"The first reality: The shelf life\nof a hustler is extraordinarily short."},"201":{"dur":4,"text":"Undeniably, this life is illegal\nand very dangerous."},"206":{"dur":4,"text":"So, the fate of a hustler is always\ndeath or incarceration."},"212":{"dur":5,"text":"The second reality: Street hustling\nis extremely immoral."},"218":{"dur":4,"text":"My worst moment as a human being came\nduring my time hustling in the streets."},"224":{"dur":3,"text":"One time I sold crack to a pregnant girl;"},"227":{"dur":4,"text":"a teenage, black, pregnant girl."},"233":{"dur":3,"text":"To this day I remember exactly\nwhat she was wearing,"},"236":{"dur":5,"text":"the way her hair was styled,\nthe plastic neon bracelet on her wrist,"},"243":{"dur":3,"text":"and the look in her eyes\nwhen I put that rock in her hand."},"248":{"dur":4,"text":"You see the mentality of a street hustler\nis rooted in exploitation."},"252":{"dur":3,"text":"Integrity, character:\nall that goes out the window."},"256":{"dur":4,"text":"You quickly learn to use\npeople's weaknesses to your advantage."},"262":{"dur":1,"text":"Now the third reality:"},"265":{"dur":3,"text":"Most street hustlers have been living\nthis life for so long,"},"269":{"dur":1,"text":"it becomes all they know."},"271":{"dur":3,"text":"They literally can't see themselves\ndoing anything else."},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"Now this would be the case for me."},"279":{"dur":3,"text":"And it would be my refusal\nto walk away from this life"},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"that would eventually lead\nto my incarceration"},"285":{"dur":1,"text":"for assault with a firearm."},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"Now being incarcerated gave\nme time to reflect."},"291":{"dur":3,"text":"I realized that I had become a virus"},"295":{"dur":5,"text":"that infected and corrupted virtually\neverything that I came into contact with."},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"This was a sobering realization,"},"303":{"dur":3,"text":"and would be the motivating force\nbehind me wanting to do"},"307":{"dur":1,"text":"something positive with my life."},"309":{"dur":2,"text":"And I would commit to this."},"312":{"dur":3,"text":"But even though I knew\nI was finished with the street life,"},"315":{"dur":1,"text":"I still had a problem."},"317":{"dur":2,"text":"You see, I still had hustle."},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"I still was very ambitious."},"324":{"dur":4,"text":"And I could not find any occupation\nthat I could actually see myself doing"},"328":{"dur":4,"text":"when I got out of prison that would\nallow me to satisfy this ambition."},"333":{"dur":2,"text":"This would prove to be problematic,"},"335":{"dur":3,"text":"and I would spend years \nsearching for a solution."},"339":{"dur":2,"text":"Fortunately, a solution\nwould finally present itself"},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"when I arrived here at San Quentin."},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"San Quentin provided me\nwith the opportunity"},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"to further my education for free,"},"351":{"dur":4,"text":"and I've taken a number\nof business related college courses."},"356":{"dur":4,"text":"During this time,\nI discovered entrepreneurship."},"362":{"dur":4,"text":"Now there was something\nvery familiar about entrepreneurship."},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"(Laughter)"},"368":{"dur":4,"text":"I found that entrepreneurs had hustle."},"374":{"dur":5,"text":"These are people who routinely take risk\nand embark on endeavors that demand"},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"that they think on their feet,\ntrust their gut,"},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"and do whatever it takes\nto make it happen."},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"I then learned, to my surprise,"},"389":{"dur":3,"text":"that not only were many key\nentrepreneurial principles"},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"things I had unknowingly\npicked up in the street"},"395":{"dur":3,"text":"but also many of the same characteristics"},"398":{"dur":4,"text":"that make a successful entrepreneur\nare what make a successful hustler."},"404":{"dur":6,"text":"For example, both are self-starters\nwho are highly ambitious, adaptive,"},"411":{"dur":2,"text":"resourceful, and tenacious."},"414":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's when it hit me;\nI had found my solution."},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"It was entrepreneurship."},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"And it was perfect,"},"422":{"dur":5,"text":"because I found I was uniquely\nequipped to pursue this profession."},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"I already possessed\nmany of the same characteristics"},"432":{"dur":1,"text":"of a successful entrepreneur."},"435":{"dur":4,"text":"My time as a street hustler had allowed me\nto unknowingly internalize"},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"a number of key\nentrepreneurial principles."},"442":{"dur":6,"text":"And most importantly, entrepreneurship\nallowed me to satisfy my ambition"},"448":{"dur":5,"text":"by letting me use my strongest asset, \nmy hustle, in a productive way."},"457":{"dur":5,"text":"This revelation would lead to my fixation,\nand obsession even, with entrepreneurship."},"464":{"dur":4,"text":"And soon I would start to think about\nhow this could benefit others like me."},"469":{"dur":4,"text":"You see I've come to believe\nthat entrepreneurship is the vehicle"},"473":{"dur":4,"text":"that can allow all street hustlers\nto successfully transition"},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"out of the street life."},"480":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think the most effective way\nto get them to buy into this idea"},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"is by using incarcerated street hustlers"},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"to convince them."},"491":{"dur":1,"text":"Think about it."},"492":{"dur":3,"text":"Being incarcerated will have given\nthese street hustlers the time"},"496":{"dur":5,"text":"to reflect and truly grasp\nhow damaging the street life is,"},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"so they'll be much more\nreceptive to this idea."},"506":{"dur":5,"text":"Also, the fact that they've been\nincarcerated will be to their advantage."},"513":{"dur":5,"text":"You see, doing time is something\nthat is glorified in the street life."},"519":{"dur":3,"text":"So, once they've been released,\nthey'll be able to use the fact"},"522":{"dur":3,"text":"that they've been in prison\nto gain credibility."},"526":{"dur":5,"text":"And it will be this credibility that will\nallow them to spread this idea to others."},"532":{"dur":5,"text":"In addition to this, entrepreneurship\nalso provides incarcerated street hustlers"},"538":{"dur":4,"text":"with a valuable tool that will help\nto keep them from reoffending."},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"Now this has already been proven."},"545":{"dur":4,"text":"Here at San Quentin, a program called\n\"The Last Mile\" teaches prisoners"},"550":{"dur":5,"text":"to transform ideas into viable businesses\nusing entrepreneurship."},"556":{"dur":5,"text":"To date, graduates from this program\nwho have been released back into society"},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"have a zero per cent recidivism rate."},"565":{"dur":3,"text":"(Applause)"},"572":{"dur":5,"text":"So, with that I say that it's time\nthat we all expanded our perceived utility"},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"of entrepreneurship."},"580":{"dur":4,"text":"Let's look at this as more\nthan just a business concept."},"584":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's also look at it\nas a rehabilitative tool"},"587":{"dur":1,"text":"that will equip street hustlers"},"590":{"dur":3,"text":"with the means\nto transform their potential."},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you."},"595":{"dur":1,"text":"(Applause) (Cheers)"}}
