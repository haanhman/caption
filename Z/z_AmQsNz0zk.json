write to Buchan, is a letter about\nhis view of Canada back in 1935 and '36."},"716":{"dur":3,"text":"He loved Canada and he loved the spaciousness\nand he said, \"You don't know Canada, if you"},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"haven't seen the north.\""},"722":{"dur":6,"text":"But he was particularly concerned about compartmentalization\nand rival factions in camps and I guess we"},"729":{"dur":4,"text":"would say two solitudes and more and hoping\nthat Canada could overcome it."},"733":{"dur":4,"text":"DJ: And my letter to him, without saying the\nexperiment is finished,

made this work and we've had to, 'cause\nthe country has not permitted us to quarrel"},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"over silly things and some will find the common\nway."},"765":{"dur":5,"text":"And Buchan, of course, would do that remarkably\nbecause he was that pragmatic Scot, son of"},"770":{"dur":5,"text":"the Manse, a man of faith, but a man of action\nand captured so much of this in what he said."},"775":{"dur":6,"text":"Buchan also was the first to establish one\nof the Governor General Awards for excellence,"},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"that for literary
