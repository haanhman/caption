next\npresident of the United States is"},"7":{"dur":3,"text":"that, first off, we keep\nthe \"Patient Protection\" part"},"11":{"dur":1,"text":"of the Affordable Care Act,"},"12":{"dur":2,"text":"which has set off the quality revolution"},"15":{"dur":2,"text":"in health care in America."},"17":{"dur":2,"text":"And secondly, that they\nstart something similar to"},"19":{"dur":2,"text":"the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)"},"22":{"dur":2,"text":"that the SEC set up in the past"},"25":{"dur":2,"text":"to protect consumers\nfrom investment fraud,"},"27":{"dur":2,"text":"but to do so for health care."},"30":{"dur":3,"text":"The Affordable Care Act has\nbeen much discussed lately,"},"33":{"dur":3,"text":"in particular, health-care\ninsurance for all Americans"},"36":{"dur":2,"text":"and the difficulties with the exchanges."},"39":{"dur":2,"text":"But what's not been much discussed"},"41":{"dur":3,"text":"is the patient-protection part of the act."},"44":{"dur":2,"text":"The patient-protection part of the act"},"47":{"dur":2,"text":"has started a number\nof different programs,"},"49":{"dur":2,"text":"in particular the Hospital\nValue-Based Purchasing Program,"},"52":{"dur":2,"text":"the Hospital Readmissions\nReduction Program,"},"54":{"dur":2,"text":"and the Medicare Savings Program,"},"56":{"dur":2,"text":"that tie money to quality."},"60":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, as a result of this, today,"},"62":{"dur":4,"text":"30 percent of Medicare payments are\nnow tied to quality metrics,"},"67":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's expected in\nthe next couple of years"},"69":{"dur":1,"text":"for that to move to 50 percent."},"71":{"dur":2,"text":"However, there's a crisis brewing,"},"74":{"dur":2,"text":"and the crisis is that the quality metrics"},"76":{"dur":2,"text":"that are being calculated are inaccurate,"},"78":{"dur":3,"text":"and as a consequence of\nthis, we have hospitals"},"82":{"dur":2,"text":"that are being penalized\nthat are good hospitals,"},"84":{"dur":2,"text":"and we have hospitals\nthat are bad hospitals"},"87":{"dur":1,"text":"that are being rewarded."},"89":{"dur":3,"text":"We also have the problem\nof the patients themselves,"},"92":{"dur":2,"text":"because the patients are\nbeing directed in some cases"},"94":{"dur":1,"text":"to providers that, in fact,"},"96":{"dur":2,"text":"are not providing the best care."},"98":{"dur":1,"text":"We currently lack national standards"},"100":{"dur":2,"text":"for how hospitals should\ncontrol internally"},"103":{"dur":3,"text":"the collection and maintenance of data."},"107":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, I've heard of\nhospitals that, for example,"},"109":{"dur":1,"text":"upon the death of a patient,"},"111":{"dur":3,"text":"will make sure that things\nlike obesity and diabetes"},"114":{"dur":2,"text":"are properly coded,"},"116":{"dur":3,"text":"and by doing so have had\nsignificant increases"},"119":{"dur":2,"text":"in their mortality quality metric."},"124":{"dur":3,"text":"And so what you have are\nhospitals, some hospitals,"},"127":{"dur":4,"text":"are investing heavily in\nthese internal controls,"},"132":{"dur":3,"text":"and are therefore gaming the system,"},"135":{"dur":1,"text":"where you have, on the other hand,"},"136":{"dur":2,"text":"other hospitals that are not investing"},"138":{"dur":2,"text":"in these internal controls quite so much,"},"141":{"dur":2,"text":"and even though they look not as good"},"143":{"dur":2,"text":"in terms of the quality metrics\nthat are being reported,"},"145":{"dur":2,"text":"they, in fact, have higher quality."},"148":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that's one area\nwhere there's an issue."},"150":{"dur":2,"text":"The other issue is in\nexternal data integrity."},"153":{"dur":1,"text":"And so, some of my collaborators"},"154":{"dur":1,"text":"at Rush University Medical Center"},"156":{"dur":1,"text":"just published this month an article"},"158":{"dur":1,"text":"in the \"Joint Commission Journal"},"160":{"dur":2,"text":"on Quality and Patient Safety\" showing"},"163":{"dur":4,"text":"that the patient safety indices\nthat are being calculated"},"167":{"dur":2,"text":"by \"U.S. News & World Report,\" in the past"},"170":{"dur":2,"text":"have suffered from a data-integrity issue."},"173":{"dur":3,"text":"And as a result of that,\n\"U.S. News & World Report\""},"176":{"dur":2,"text":"has actually changed their methodology"},"179":{"dur":2,"text":"for how they calculate these scores."},"181":{"dur":2,"text":"The second problem is with methodology."},"184":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, a couple years ago,\nthe Institute of Medicine"},"186":{"dur":2,"text":"published a report saying\nthat hospitals should begin"},"189":{"dur":3,"text":"to collect social and behavioral\ndeterminants of health,"},"192":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's been well understood\nthat these determinants"},"195":{"dur":3,"text":"actually have significant\neffect on readmissions,"},"199":{"dur":2,"text":"rates, and mortality, and other things."},"201":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, for safety net hospitals in particular,"},"204":{"dur":3,"text":"it's felt that they are\nbeing unfairly penalized"},"208":{"dur":1,"text":"because these determinants are not being"},"209":{"dur":1,"text":"accurately captured."},"211":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, my second recommendation"},"213":{"dur":2,"text":"is that the government should set up"},"215":{"dur":2,"text":"essentially a FASB for health care."},"218":{"dur":2,"text":"So just like the SEC started the Financial"},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"Accounting Standards Board some years ago"},"223":{"dur":3,"text":"to protect the consumer\nfrom investor fraud,"},"227":{"dur":2,"text":"the federal government should\nstart a similar agency\u2014"},"229":{"dur":4,"text":"nonprofit, independent\u2014\nthat has two basic roles."},"234":{"dur":3,"text":"One is setting standards for hospitals,"},"238":{"dur":1,"text":"for the internal controls of hospitals"},"240":{"dur":3,"text":"around data collection and data integrity."},"243":{"dur":1,"text":"And then they should\nalso be setting standards"},"245":{"dur":3,"text":"for external reporting, much\nlike the National Quality Forum"},"248":{"dur":2,"text":"does today, for example."},"251":{"dur":3,"text":"But in addition, they should\nalso have audit powers,"},"254":{"dur":4,"text":"so they should be able\nto go into hospitals"},"258":{"dur":2,"text":"and verify that the\nstandards that they've set"},"261":{"dur":4,"text":"for internal controls are,\nin fact, being followed."},"265":{"dur":3,"text":"In addition, any agency,\ngovernment or nongovernment,"},"268":{"dur":3,"text":"that's involved in rating\nhospitals should be subject"},"271":{"dur":1,"text":"to audit, and the quality metrics"},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"that they're reporting\nshould be subject to audit,"},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"to make sure that they're following"},"278":{"dur":2,"text":"proper methodological standards"},"281":{"dur":2,"text":"and that there's transparency."}}
