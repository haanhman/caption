he's kind of the\nexperimental brewer"},"570":{"dur":4,"text":"in the region, almost, because\nhe added ginger to his red ale."},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"And he made a pale\nale, but it's

tart."},"708":{"dur":3,"text":"It's got a light body,\nand it's refreshing."},"711":{"dur":6,"text":"But they use Ethiopian\ncoffee and geisha root in it."},"718":{"dur":4,"text":"It smells exactly like\ncoffee and that aromas"},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"that you might associate\nwith a stout or a porter."},"725":{"dur":4,"text":"And then you get this really\ntart beer coming after it,"},"729":{"dur":4,"text":"and it's a little\nconfusing but wonderful."},"734":{"dur":1,"text":"So they're doing that."},"736":{"dur":4,"text":"And they're barrel aging and\ntrying out different

have cooled\nbeer in an open vessel,"},"763":{"dur":3,"text":"after it's been brewed."},"767":{"dur":4,"text":"And they're brewing things\nlike simple sour, which"},"771":{"dur":4,"text":"is corn and

bittering hops at all."},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"So they're really\ntrying to find new ways"},"795":{"dur":4,"text":"to do interesting things\nand change things up."},"799":{"dur":4,"text":"And then they have little\nguys like Sloop Brewing, which"},"803":{"dur":4,"text":"you may have heard\nrecently-- they're expanding."},"807":{"dur":3,"text":"But they started\nout in a garage,"},"811":{"dur":3,"text":"selling a peach berliner\nweisse at farmers' markets."},"815":{"dur":6,"text":"So the Hudson Valley\nfor us really kind of"},"821":{"dur":4,"text":"showcased the wide
