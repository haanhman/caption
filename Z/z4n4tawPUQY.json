really\nexcited that I get"},"46":{"dur":2,"text":"to talk to you about this,\nbecause I love to bake,"},"49":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's something that I've\ngot to do since I was really,"},"53":{"dur":2,"text":"I think, like eight years old."},"55":{"dur":1,"text":"And my parents never\nreally baked much,"},"57":{"dur":4,"text":"so I started making cookies\nand cakes and anything."},"61":{"dur":3,"text":"The low sugar thing\nis interesting,"},"65":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's been something\nthat I think a lot of people"},"67":{"dur":2,"text":"are interested in\nlearning more about."},"70":{"dur":3,"text":"What made you start to decide\nto do a cookbook about that?"},"73":{"dur":1,"text":"JOANNE CHANG: It\ncertainly wasn't anything"},"75":{"dur":2,"text":"that I had planned all along."},"78":{"dur":2,"text":"The first baking\nbook, \"Flour,\" I'd"},"80":{"dur":2,"text":"always wanted to\nwrite a baking book."},"82":{"dur":1,"text":"The second book,\n\"Flour, Too,\" was"},"84":{"dur":1,"text":"kind of a natural\noffshoot of the first one,"},"86":{"dur":1,"text":"because there are\na lot of people"},"88":{"dur":1,"text":"who like to eat savory things."},"89":{"dur":2,"text":"And at the bakery, we do a\nlot of sandwiches and soups"},"91":{"dur":0,"text":"and salads."},"92":{"dur":2,"text":"And so after the\nfirst book came out,"},"94":{"dur":1,"text":"a lot of people, a\nlot of our customers,"},"96":{"dur":4,"text":"said, what happened to all of\nthe savory part of your menu?"},"101":{"dur":1,"text":"So that led to the second book."},"102":{"dur":5,"text":"So this third book, \"Baking with\nLess Sugar,\" was not in my plan"},"107":{"dur":4,"text":"until I started to think, OK,\nnext book, what should I do?"},"111":{"dur":3,"text":"I really enjoy writing books,\nand honestly, the next book"},"115":{"dur":2,"text":"was supposed to be the\nMyers + Chang book."},"117":{"dur":0,"text":"FEMALE SPEAKER: That'll\nbe your fourth visit."},"118":{"dur":1,"text":"JOANNE CHANG: That is going\nto be the fourth visit,"},"120":{"dur":1,"text":"and we did just sign a\ndeal for the fourth book."},"122":{"dur":2,"text":"So that one will be forthcoming."},"124":{"dur":2,"text":"But what happened\nwas I was starting"},"126":{"dur":2,"text":"to write the proposal for\nthe Myers + Chang book,"},"128":{"dur":3,"text":"and like two or three\nthings happened all at once."},"132":{"dur":3,"text":"One, at home, for\nmyself and my husband--"},"135":{"dur":1,"text":"I eat sugar all day long."},"137":{"dur":2,"text":"That's part of my job,\nto go to all the bakeries"},"139":{"dur":2,"text":"and taste the\nthings that we make."},"142":{"dur":2,"text":"And fortunate for me, I don't\nhave a problem with sugar."},"145":{"dur":2,"text":"I've been eating it my\nwhole life, and I love it."},"148":{"dur":2,"text":"My husband loves\nsugar, but he is"},"151":{"dur":3,"text":"somebody who definitely goes\nthrough sugar highs and sugar"},"154":{"dur":1,"text":"lows."},"155":{"dur":3,"text":"I used to bring stuff home from\nthe bakery, and after eating it"},"159":{"dur":1,"text":"he would just crash."},"161":{"dur":2,"text":"And I started to try\nto figure out ways"},"163":{"dur":2,"text":"that I could bring\nstuff home or make stuff"},"165":{"dur":3,"text":"at home that he could enjoy\nand not feel deprived,"},"169":{"dur":3,"text":"but that wouldn't cause him\nto do this up and down thing."},"173":{"dur":3,"text":"So I was just starting to\nexperiment at home, just for me"},"176":{"dur":0,"text":"personally."},"177":{"dur":3,"text":"At about the same time,\nmy publisher, Chronicle,"},"180":{"dur":2,"text":"called me and said, OK,\nwe're interested in doing"},"182":{"dur":0,"text":"a third book with you."},"183":{"dur":0,"text":"And I was like, great."},"184":{"dur":3,"text":"And they said, no, we actually\nthink that a low sugar"},"187":{"dur":1,"text":"book would be\nsomething that people"},"189":{"dur":1,"text":"would be really interested in."},"190":{"dur":1,"text":"I thought, OK, I'm\ndoing this at home."},"192":{"dur":1,"text":"This could be a thing."},"193":{"dur":1,"text":"I wasn't positive."},"195":{"dur":2,"text":"And then literally probably\nabout a week later,"},"197":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Oprah Magazine\"\nemailed and said,"},"199":{"dur":3,"text":"we want you to write an\narticle about five desserts"},"203":{"dur":0,"text":"with no sugar."},"204":{"dur":1,"text":"And I just thought, this\nis just meant to be."},"206":{"dur":0,"text":"It's a sign."},"207":{"dur":3,"text":"So I did these five\ndesserts for the magazine,"},"211":{"dur":2,"text":"and I sent them to\nChronicle Books and I said,"},"213":{"dur":0,"text":"what do you think?"},"214":{"dur":1,"text":"And they said, this\nis your next book."},"216":{"dur":4,"text":"So I spent about a\nyear testing recipes."},"220":{"dur":1,"text":"And this was really\nchallenging for me,"},"222":{"dur":2,"text":"because the first two\nbooks are all recipes that"},"224":{"dur":0,"text":"currently exist."},"225":{"dur":2,"text":"They're things that we serve\nevery day at the bakery"},"227":{"dur":2,"text":"that I have recipes for that\nwe make in huge batch sizes."},"230":{"dur":1,"text":"So with the first\nand second book,"},"232":{"dur":1,"text":"I just had to reduce\nthe batch size."},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"But for this third\nbook, I had to make up"},"237":{"dur":2,"text":"recipes for pretty much\nevery single recipe,"},"239":{"dur":1,"text":"to start from scratch."},"240":{"dur":1,"text":"FEMALE SPEAKER:\nYeah, that was really"},"242":{"dur":1,"text":"interesting to read\nin your introduction"},"244":{"dur":3,"text":"and throughout the book-- how\nyou were able to test recipes,"},"248":{"dur":1,"text":"and the ones that\nyou thought might not"},"249":{"dur":2,"text":"work, like the monkey bread\nrecipe that you said actually"},"252":{"dur":0,"text":"did work."},"253":{"dur":1,"text":"And I haven't had a\nchance to make it yet,"},"255":{"dur":1,"text":"but it really good."},"256":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm actually curious if\nthere were any recipes"},"259":{"dur":3,"text":"that you thought would work\nor that you tried really"},"262":{"dur":3,"text":"hard to make work that you just\ncouldn't get with low sugar."},"266":{"dur":2,"text":"JOANNE CHANG: Yeah, there's one\nrecipe that's still in my head,"},"269":{"dur":3,"text":"because I still want to\ntry to figure it out."},"272":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's lemon pudding cake."},"274":{"dur":1,"text":"Have you ever had\nlemon pudding cake?"},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a really easy cake batter."},"279":{"dur":3,"text":"you make this cake batter, you\nput it in a pan, you bake it,"},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"and naturally, the cake\npart floats to the top,"},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"and then at the bottom\nis a layer pudding."},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a really simple,\nwonderful desert."},"290":{"dur":2,"text":"And I thought, I\nwould love to do"},"292":{"dur":3,"text":"a low-sugar, no-sugar\nversion, but with maple syrup."},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"And I thought, maybe I could\nmake a maple pudding cake."},"298":{"dur":2,"text":"And I imagined this top\nlayer of cake floating"},"300":{"dur":2,"text":"to the top that was\nkind of like a pancake,"},"303":{"dur":2,"text":"and then maybe like a creamy,\nmaple-y sauce at the bottom."},"305":{"dur":2,"text":"Doesn't that sound good?"},"307":{"dur":4,"text":"I had the vision of what it was\ngoing to taste like in my head."},"312":{"dur":3,"text":"I must have made maple\npudding cake like every week"},"315":{"dur":1,"text":"probably for the whole year."},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"I feel like it was about the\nwhole year of writing the book,"},"318":{"dur":1,"text":"and it just kept\nbeing that recipe"},"320":{"dur":1,"text":"that I was like, I'm going\nto try it again next week."},"322":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to try\nit again next week."},"323":{"dur":0,"text":"I never got it."},"327":{"dur":3,"text":"I think what happens is\nyou have to do something"},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"with the eggs that involves\nsugar that doesn't work"},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"with maple in order to get\nthe pudding to the sink"},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"and the cake to rise."},"337":{"dur":2,"text":"FEMALE SPEAKER: That brings me\nto an interesting question too,"},"339":{"dur":1,"text":"is the science behind sugar."},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"And there were other\nthings like meringues"},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"that you said you knew\nyou couldn't really"},"346":{"dur":0,"text":"even bother doing."},"347":{"dur":3,"text":"Could you tell us a little\nbit about what low-sugar means"},"351":{"dur":5,"text":"in this cookbook, and maybe also\na little bit about the science"},"357":{"dur":4,"text":"behind sugar and how it helps\nmake certain things work"},"361":{"dur":1,"text":"the way they do in baking?"},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"JOANNE CHANG: So I thought\nthat the biggest challenge"},"365":{"dur":2,"text":"in writing this book was\ngoing to be figuring out"},"367":{"dur":4,"text":"how to replicate the sweetness\nin desserts, because you're"},"371":{"dur":1,"text":"eliminating sugar."},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"Because that's what we\nthink of as sugar, right?"},"375":{"dur":0,"text":"It's sweet."},"376":{"dur":1,"text":"So if you have something\nthat has less sugar,"},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"it's going to be less sweet."},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"So how do I trick the palate\ninto thinking that it still"},"382":{"dur":1,"text":"tastes sweet?"},"383":{"dur":3,"text":"But that ended up being the\neasiest part of the book,"},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"in part because we\nare very adaptable."},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"And it works with salt,\nand it works with sugar."},"391":{"dur":3,"text":"If you go without salt or\nif you go without sugar,"},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't know the exact time\nit takes, but after a while"},"398":{"dur":3,"text":"your palate just starts to\nnaturally prefer the less"},"402":{"dur":1,"text":"salt or the less sugar."},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's the same with\nmore salt and more sugar."},"404":{"dur":2,"text":"The more you eat of sugar\nand the more you eat of salt,"},"407":{"dur":1,"text":"the more your palate\nadjusts to that,"},"408":{"dur":3,"text":"and then you want things that\nare more sugary or more salty."},"412":{"dur":3,"text":"So that part was easy\nin that once I started"},"415":{"dur":3,"text":"testing these recipes\nwith less sugar, for me,"},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"I recognized that things\nthat were less sweet"},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"tasted just as\ngood, if not better."},"423":{"dur":2,"text":"But the challenging part\nwas the chemistry of sugar,"},"425":{"dur":4,"text":"because sugar does so many\nother things than just sweeten."},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"The main-- well, there's\na bunch of main things,"},"432":{"dur":2,"text":"but one of the big\nthings that sugar does"},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"is it's hygroscopic,\nwhich means that it"},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"attracts moisture in the air."},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"And so it attracts water."},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"And so in any baked good\nthat has sugar in it,"},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"it sits there on the counter,\nand as it's sitting there"},"447":{"dur":3,"text":"it's attracting water\nmolecules from the air"},"451":{"dur":1,"text":"and bringing it to itself."},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's what makes\nthe pastry stay moist"},"454":{"dur":0,"text":"for a couple of days."},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"So you can make a\ncake today and still"},"457":{"dur":1,"text":"serve it tomorrow\nor the next day,"},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"and it'll still\nbe great if it has"},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"the regular amount of sugar."},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"As you start to\nreduce sugar, it'll"},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"taste great when it's\nfresh out of the oven."},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"And then maybe by tonight\nor maybe by tomorrow"},"470":{"dur":3,"text":"it's dry, because it doesn't\nhave the sugars to draw"},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"in all the moisture."},"475":{"dur":3,"text":"Another thing that sugar\ndoes is that it caramelizes"},"478":{"dur":1,"text":"is when it's in the oven."},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"And so when you're making\nsomething like a cookie,"},"482":{"dur":3,"text":"the sugar combines with all\nof the other ingredients"},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"in the batter, and then\nit hits that oven heat"},"488":{"dur":1,"text":"and then it starts\nto caramelize."},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's what\nallows the cookie"},"491":{"dur":1,"text":"to be kind of crunchy\non the outside"},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"and then maybe a little\nsoft on the inside."},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's really challenging\nto get texture right"},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"when you don't have sugar,\nor if you have less sugar."},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that was a\nreally big challenge."},"502":{"dur":1,"text":"Another thing that\nsugar does which"},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"is kind of in line\nwith the caramelization"},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"is that it adds\ncolor to baked goods."},"509":{"dur":5,"text":"And so any picture-- if you\nimagine a beautiful vanilla"},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"cake, you just see\nlike golden brown."},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"Every recipe says,\nbake till golden brown."},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"But you can't bake\nthings till golden brown"},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"if there's no sugar, because\nit'll never get that way."},"525":{"dur":1,"text":"And that was, for\nme, something that"},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"took me awhile to recognize."},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"I was making the carrot\ncake, which is actually"},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"the cover photo in the book."},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"And the carrot cake doesn't\nhave any sugar in it,"},"537":{"dur":1,"text":"but it has apple juice."},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"It has reduced apple juice."},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"And I kept making this batter\nand testing it and tasting it"},"543":{"dur":1,"text":"and saying, OK, it\ntastes sweet enough,"},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"putting it into the oven."},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"And then I do everything by eye."},"548":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't do it by time,\nbecause ovens are different,"},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"and everything's\nalways different."},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"So at this point, I just look\nat things and I touch them."},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"And the first couple\nrounds of this cake,"},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"I would keep it in there\nuntil it got brown,"},"561":{"dur":2,"text":"which it turns out\nwas pretty much burnt,"},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"because it doesn't\nbrown without the sugar."},"565":{"dur":3,"text":"And so when you pull it out of\nthe oven, it looks really pale."},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"It looks the same color\nas it did when it goes in."},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"It's just a little\nbit more solid."},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"So you have to get used\nto that when you're not"},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"baking with as much sugar."},"576":{"dur":1,"text":"FEMALE SPEAKER: I\nreally liked the way you"},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"have the chapters organized."},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"It starts with the\nlower sugar recipes"},"582":{"dur":3,"text":"and then goes into just\nchocolate, honey, maple,"},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"and then fruit."},"590":{"dur":4,"text":"What was your reasoning behind\norganizing it in that way?"},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"JOANNE CHANG: Well, I wanted\nto ease people into the idea."},"598":{"dur":3,"text":"So the first chapter is\nprobably about 10 or 12 recipes"},"602":{"dur":4,"text":"of things that we all\neat every day that have"},"606":{"dur":1,"text":"less sugar-- so not no-sugar."},"608":{"dur":3,"text":"So the fudgy mascarpone\nbrownies that I made,"},"611":{"dur":3,"text":"the banana bread,\nyellow birthday cake,"},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"coconut chiffon cake-- all of\nthose have white sugar in them,"},"618":{"dur":3,"text":"but at least half\nthe amount or even"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"less than your standard recipe."},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"So I wanted to just\nkind of introduce"},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"the baker, or the\nreader, to the idea"},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"that you can reduce\nsugar and still have"},"630":{"dur":1,"text":"something that tastes great."},"632":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, we have samples of\nthe oatmeal raisin walnut"},"635":{"dur":2,"text":"cookie that is made with a\nthird of the amount of sugar"},"638":{"dur":1,"text":"as the standard recipe."},"640":{"dur":3,"text":"So that was the first chapter."},"643":{"dur":5,"text":"And then, in terms of grouping\nit according to flavors--"},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"you asked earlier why did\nI want to write the book,"},"651":{"dur":1,"text":"and I give you a\ncouple of reasons."},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"Another reason is that sugar\nitself doesn't actually"},"655":{"dur":0,"text":"taste like anything."},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"It's just sweet."},"657":{"dur":4,"text":"Whereas sweeteners like\nmaple and honey and fruit"},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"actually have flavor, and they\nadd a whole other dimension"},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"of flavor to whatever it\nis that you're making."},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"And a big part of\nwriting this book"},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"was recognizing that\nif you don't use sugar"},"671":{"dur":1,"text":"as your sweetener\nbut instead turn"},"673":{"dur":3,"text":"to a natural sweetener like a\nhoney or a maple or molasses,"},"677":{"dur":3,"text":"you're adding that flavor\nto your baked good, which"},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"is in my world a\nreally great thing."},"682":{"dur":1,"text":"You have something\nthat tastes good"},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"and you add more flavor to it."},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"That's even better."},"686":{"dur":1,"text":"So I wanted to group\nit accordingly,"},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"so that if you're somebody\nwho really likes honey"},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"and if you like that\nflavor of honey,"},"693":{"dur":1,"text":"here's a whole bunch\nof recipes that"},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"allow you to use that\nrather than white sugar"},"697":{"dur":1,"text":"in making your baked goods."},"698":{"dur":0,"text":"FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah."},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"And I told you I made the\nlemon ricotta cupcakes, which"},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"are just sweetened with honey."},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"And it was great,\nand you would never"},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"have known that\nthe frosting even"},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"didn't have any sugar in it."},"707":{"dur":1,"text":"It was great."},"709":{"dur":3,"text":"So I did notice that the only\ncheesecake recipe in here"},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"is cheesecake maple bar,\nsomething like that?"},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"JOANNE CHANG: The pumpkin?"},"716":{"dur":0,"text":"FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah, pumpkin."},"717":{"dur":1,"text":"That's what it was."},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"Was there any reason that\nyou didn't-- I happen to love"},"720":{"dur":2,"text":"cheesecake, so first I'm\nasking about cheesecake."},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"Was there any reason\nyou didn't do just"},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"a regular, straight-up\ncheesecake, or just as it"},"728":{"dur":0,"text":"happened?"},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"JOANNE CHANG: No, no reason."},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"I wanted to do\nsomething with pumpkin,"},"734":{"dur":4,"text":"and we've often talked\nabout introducing a pumpkin"},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"cheesecake during the\nThanksgiving period"},"741":{"dur":0,"text":"at the bakery."},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I was thinking that\nwe could do something."},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, pumpkin goes\nwell with maple,"},"747":{"dur":4,"text":"but we already have in the\nbook a maple pumpkin pie."},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"So then I got really\ninterested and excited"},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"about baking with dates."},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"And so this recipe\nhas dates in the base,"},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"and then the actual\ncheesecake is"},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"sweetened with reduced\napple juice, which"},"765":{"dur":4,"text":"is one of the go-to's\nin the fruit chapter."},"769":{"dur":2,"text":"Again, you bring in\nso many more flavors"},"771":{"dur":3,"text":"when you are working with\nfruits versus just with sugar."},"774":{"dur":3,"text":"And I wanted to try out\nmixing apple and pumpkin,"},"778":{"dur":1,"text":"and it all worked out great."},"779":{"dur":1,"text":"FEMALE SPEAKER: That's awesome."},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"So again, we were\ntalking about this"},"783":{"dur":3,"text":"before-- I had thought about\ngoing to culinary school"},"787":{"dur":1,"text":"for pastry arts at one point."},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"Almost dropped out of\ngrad school to do it,"},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"and decided instead\nnot to, in part"},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"because I was worried\nthat if I did something"},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"that I loved doing at\nhome and on my own time"},"798":{"dur":1,"text":"all the time for work,\nI wouldn't enjoy it"},"800":{"dur":1,"text":"as much anymore."},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"So do you still like baking?"},"804":{"dur":1,"text":"JOANNE CHANG: I\nstill love baking."},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't make as much\nas I used to, for sure."},"809":{"dur":4,"text":"The first six years of the\nbakery, I was baking every day."},"813":{"dur":1,"text":"And then when we opened\nthe second location,"},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"my role shifted so that I\nwas no longer in the kitchen"},"818":{"dur":1,"text":"every single day."},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"But I still in the kitchen\nprobably about half the time."},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"And then when we opened\nCambridge, the third location,"},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"then it shifted entirely\nout of the kitchen."},"828":{"dur":3,"text":"So I bake now when I'm\ntesting recipes for a book,"},"831":{"dur":3,"text":"and I'll bake at home just\nfor special occasions."},"835":{"dur":1,"text":"It's still something\nthat I enjoy,"},"836":{"dur":3,"text":"but as somebody who\nif you enjoy baking"},"840":{"dur":1,"text":"and you want to do\nit professionally--"},"842":{"dur":2,"text":"not that I think you guys are\nlooking for career changes,"},"844":{"dur":3,"text":"but if you were-- it\nis very, very different"},"848":{"dur":1,"text":"to do it professionally."},"849":{"dur":0,"text":"It's a job."},"850":{"dur":1,"text":"It's still work."},"851":{"dur":3,"text":"We get a lot of people, a lot of\ncareer changers, who come to us"},"854":{"dur":2,"text":"and say, I bake a lot at\nhome and I really love it,"},"857":{"dur":3,"text":"and I want to come learn how\nto make cookies at Flour."},"860":{"dur":3,"text":"And everybody loves it for\nabout two weeks, sometimes"},"864":{"dur":2,"text":"three weeks, and then\nthe reality hits in."},"866":{"dur":1,"text":"It's like, every day\nyou're going to come in"},"868":{"dur":2,"text":"and you're going

hard"},"878":{"dur":0,"text":"and it's sweaty."},"879":{"dur":0,"text":"It's still work."},"880":{"dur":2,"text":"So when you're baking\nat home, you obviously"},"882":{"dur":1,"text":"have freedom to do\nwhatever you want."},"884":{"dur":1,"text":"You get to eat it\nwhenever you want."},"885":{"dur":1,"text":"And if it doesn't\nwork out, no big deal."},"886":{"dur":1,"text":"You just make something else."},"888":{"dur":1,"text":"Doesn't really work\nlike that at work."},"889":{"dur":3,"text":"So I always try to make people\nunderstand that it's still"},"893":{"dur":1,"text":"really fun to bake at\nwork, but it's just"},"895":{"dur":1,"text":"a different type of fun."},"896":{"dur":1,"text":"FEMALE SPEAKER: Sure."},"897":{"dur":3,"text":"So my last question before\nwe open it up to the audience"},"900":{"dur":2,"text":"is we have backyard hens."},"902":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I often\nhave a refrigerator"},"905":{"dur":2,"text":"full of two, three dozen eggs."},"908":{"dur":4,"text":"What's your favorite recipe\nthat uses a lot of eggs?"},"913":{"dur":2,"text":"JOANNE CHANG: Let's see,\nrecipes that use a lot of eggs."},"915":{"dur":1,"text":"FEMALE SPEAKER: Sweet\nor savory, either way."},"917":{"dur":3,"text":"JOANNE CHANG: Well,\nit would be sweet."},"920":{"dur":2,"text":"The chiffon cake that's\nin this book actually,"},"923":{"dur":3,"text":"or any angel food\ncake or chiffon cake"},"926":{"dur":2,"text":"is great for using\na lot of eggs."},"928":{"dur":3,"text":"The angel food cake in the first\nbook, I think, uses 12 eggs,"},"931":{"dur":3,"text":"and I think this cake\nmight use 8 or 12 eggs."},"935":{"dur":2,"text":"Any custard basically is going\nto use a lot of egg yolks."},"937":{"dur":2,"text":"So in pastry, you're always\nusing egg yolks for the most"},"940":{"dur":1,"text":"part, and you're always\ntrying to find something"},"941":{"dur":1,"text":"to do with the egg whites."},"943":{"dur":3,"text":"So I feel like ice creams\nuse a lot of egg yolks,"},"946":{"dur":2,"text":"and then meringues and\nchiffon cakes and angel food"},"949":{"dur":1,"text":"cakes use a lot of egg whites."},"950":{"dur":1,"text":"So you can make two."},"952":{"dur":2,"text":"FEMALE SPEAKER: An angel food\ncake and a giant custard."},"955":{"dur":0,"text":"JOANNE CHANG: Exactly."},"956":{"dur":2,"text":"FEMALE SPEAKER: So if there\nare questions in the audience,"},"958":{"dur":3,"text":"there are microphones\nset up in the aisles."},"962":{"dur":1,"text":"Please."},"964":{"dur":2,"text":"AUDIENCE: When you\nexperiment with cooking,"},"966":{"dur":3,"text":"do you remember any really\nbig surprises where you didn't"},"970":{"dur":2,"text":"think two things were going\nto complement each other"},"973":{"dur":2,"text":"or go together, and they\nended up being great?"},"978":{"dur":1,"text":"JOANNE CHANG: In\nbaking, you mean?"},"980":{"dur":3,"text":"I do mostly dabbling\naround in baking."},"983":{"dur":4,"text":"Let's see, two things that\ncombined that came out great."},"988":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, I was surprised\nat this pumpkin thing--"},"992":{"dur":3,"text":"Even though pumpkin pie\nand apple pie sound good,"},"995":{"dur":1,"text":"I've never had\npumpkin apple pie."},"997":{"dur":2,"text":"So when I was doing\nthe cheesecake,"},"999":{"dur":2,"text":"I was trying to figure\nout if-- I mean,"},"1002":{"dur":1,"text":"it's a double-edged sword."},"1003":{"dur":1,"text":"You're adding the flavor\nof apple to anything"},"1005":{"dur":1,"text":"that you sweeten with\napple juice, which"},"1006":{"dur":2,"text":"is great, unless it\ndoesn't go well with apple."},"1008":{"dur":2,"text":"So that actually ended\nup being really great,"},"1011":{"dur":2,"text":"because pumpkin is\nreally rich and earthy,"},"1014":{"dur":1,"text":"and apple is kind of acidic."},"1015":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I often feel like\nwhen I'm eating pumpkin,"},"1017":{"dur":1,"text":"I want something a little\nbit brighter anyway."},"1019":{"dur":3,"text":"And so by sweetening the pumpkin\nwith a little bit of apple,"},"1023":{"dur":2,"text":"for me it's a much more\nrounded, balanced dessert."},"1025":{"dur":1,"text":"So that was something\nthat I wasn't expecting."},"1030":{"dur":5,"text":"AUDIENCE: You were talking about\nhaving to experiment about how"},"1035":{"dur":1,"text":"white sugar is hygroscopic."},"1037":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was just curious,\ndid you play at all"},"1039":{"dur":3,"text":"with temperature for\nthings like baking cakes"},"1042":{"dur":2,"text":"or whatnot at the\nend so you could"},"1045":{"dur":2,"text":"try and trap the\nwater at the tail-end"},"1048":{"dur":2,"text":"of the cooking process?"},"1050":{"dur":2,"text":"JOANNE CHANG: Well, we did\nexperiment with a temperature,"},"1053":{"dur":3,"text":"just because there are things\nthat you still need them"},"1056":{"dur":1,"text":"to bake, but they don't brown."},"1058":{"dur":2,"text":"And so you're kind of adjusting."},"1060":{"dur":2,"text":"And anything with\nhoney or maple,"},"1062":{"dur":4,"text":"you want to bake it a little bit\nless, lower temperature anyway."},"1066":{"dur":5,"text":"But the hygroscopic\nis for when it's done,"},"1071":{"dur":1,"text":"and then it's sitting\non the counter"},"1073":{"dur":1,"text":"or on the shelf or whatever."},"1075":{"dur":3,"text":"That's when that element\ncomes into play more"},"1078":{"dur":2,"text":"than in the baking in the oven."},"1081":{"dur":0,"text":"Does that make sense?"},"1082":{"dur":1,"text":"AUDIENCE: Yes."},"1083":{"dur":1,"text":"So throwing it in the\nfreezer at the end"},"1085":{"dur":1,"text":"wouldn't necessarily\nhelp capture"},"1086":{"dur":2,"text":"the water inside of the cake?"},"1089":{"dur":1,"text":"JOANNE CHANG: No, it would."},"1090":{"dur":3,"text":"If you had a cake and\nyou wanted to delay"},"1094":{"dur":3,"text":"that evaporation\nor the drying, you"},"1097":{"dur":2,"text":"could definitely slow it down\nby putting it in the freezer,"},"1099":{"dur":0,"text":"for sure."},"1100":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah."},"1102":{"dur":0,"text":"Yes?"},"1103":{"dur":1,"text":"AUDIENCE: Thank you\nso much for coming."},"1104":{"dur":2,"text":"And my question's\nnot about less sugar,"},"1107":{"dur":5,"text":"but one of my favorite treats\nat Flour are the vegan muffins."},"1112":{"dur":4,"text":"You have a vegan vanilla berry\nand a vegan banana chocolate"},"1116":{"dur":0,"text":"chip."},"1117":{"dur":3,"text":"And then any time I eat a\nvegan treat anywhere else,"},"1120":{"dur":2,"text":"it's really dry and gross."},"1123":{"dur":1,"text":"So I don't know\nif it's a secret--"},"1124":{"dur":2,"text":"JOANNE CHANG: I didn't pay\nher to say that, I swear."},"1127":{"dur":1,"text":"AUDIENCE: I don't\nknow if it's a secret,"},"1128":{"dur":1,"text":"but I've always\nwondered what you"},"1130":{"dur":3,"text":"do with your vegan treats\nto make them taste just as"},"1133":{"dur":1,"text":"good as some of the other ones?"},"1135":{"dur":1,"text":"JOANNE CHANG: Well, thank you."},"1136":{"dur":7,"text":"The vegan muffin recipe is in\nthe second book, \"Flour, too.\""},"1144":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't know what\nother people are doing,"},"1146":{"dur":1,"text":"but we just\nsubstitute the things"},"1147":{"dur":2,"text":"that-- I mean, if you're\nvegan, then you already know."},"1150":{"dur":4,"text":"Like instead of milk, we use\nsoy milk or coconut milk."},"1155":{"dur":3,"text":"Instead of butter, we use oil."},"1158":{"dur":2,"text":"We didn't do anything\nfor the instead of eggs."},"1160":{"dur":2,"text":"I think we just kind\nof fiddled around"},"1163":{"dur":4,"text":"with the oil and the milk to\nmake it still liquid enough."},"1167":{"dur":4,"text":"But I don't know that we\ndid anything that magical."},"1171":{"dur":1,"text":"There's no magic to it."},"1172":{"dur":1,"text":"It's in the book."},"1177":{"dur":1,"text":"When we do come up\nwith a new recipe,"},"1179":{"dur":2,"text":"we spend a lot of\ntime experimenting."},"1181":{"dur":1,"text":"Everything is weighed\nat the bakery."},"1183":{"dur":1,"text":"Everything is\nweighed to the gram,"},"1184":{"dur":3,"text":"and we will literally change\nthings by 1% to 2% iteration"},"1188":{"dur":2,"text":"after iteration to get to\nwhere we want it to be."},"1190":{"dur":1,"text":"In fact, there's an\nemail thread going"},"1192":{"dur":1,"text":"on right now about\nsomething that they're like,"},"1193":{"dur":1,"text":"should we up it 3%?"},"1194":{"dur":1,"text":"And I was like, nope,\nlet's start with 3%."},"1196":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's try it first just 3%, and\nthen we'll see what happens."},"1199":{"dur":1,"text":"So there's a lot of testing."},"1201":{"dur":2,"text":"So the recipe for\nthe vegan muffin"},"1203":{"dur":3,"text":"that you're talking about\nwent through many rounds"},"1206":{"dur":2,"text":"of maybe it started\nout dry at one point,"},"1208":{"dur":2,"text":"and then we just added\nmore and more stuff."},"1210":{"dur":0,"text":"AUDIENCE: Thank you."},"1211":{"dur":1,"text":"JOANNE CHANG: You're welcome."},"1213":{"dur":1,"text":"Thanks so much for coming today."},"1215":{"dur":2,"text":"Curious if you can talk a\nlittle bit about your process"},"1218":{"dur":2,"text":"for testing recipes\nfor a cookbook,"},"1220":{"dur":3,"text":"and if there's like an average\nnumber of times you test,"},"1223":{"dur":3,"text":"if you throw it to other\npeople to test to make sure"},"1226":{"dur":2,"text":"it's accessible for\nthe novice baker."},"1229":{"dur":0,"text":"JOANNE CHANG: Sure."},"1230":{"dur":2,"text":"So if it's a recipe\nthat we already"},"1232":{"dur":2,"text":"have, like the\nvegan muffin recipe,"},"1234":{"dur":3,"text":"which exists at the bakery,\nbasically what happens"},"1238":{"dur":2,"text":"is-- so everything's\nin metric, and I just"},"1240":{"dur":3,"text":"reduce it to what seems like\na normal home size amount."},"1243":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I'll test it myself."},"1246":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'll go through it once."},"1248":{"dur":1,"text":"But just because I\ncan do it, I know"},"1249":{"dur":2,"text":"that that doesn't mean that it's\nready for the book, because I"},"1252":{"dur":1,"text":"know what I'm\nthinking, so I need"},"1253":{"dur":1,"text":"to give it to somebody else."},"1254":{"dur":2,"text":"So then a baker will test\nit within the bakery,"},"1257":{"dur":2,"text":"just to make sure that it's\nkind of the right thing."},"1259":{"dur":2,"text":"But even that doesn't\nreally work from a testing"},"1262":{"dur":2,"text":"perspective, because\nall the bakers know me,"},"1264":{"dur":2,"text":"and they know what I mean\nwhen I say, do this, do that."},"1266":{"dur":3,"text":"So then we send it out."},"1270":{"dur":3,"text":"Cambridge Culinary will\ntest recipes for us"},"1273":{"dur":1,"text":"for class credit."},"1274":{"dur":3,"text":"And so depending on\nwhatever semester,"},"1278":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll reach out to the\ndirector and she'll put me"},"1281":{"dur":1,"text":"in touch with that class."},"1282":{"dur":1,"text":"And they are on my\nemail list, and I say,"},"1284":{"dur":3,"text":"here's a bunch of\nrecipes I need tested."},"1287":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I have a couple\ntesters who are just people"},"1289":{"dur":4,"text":"that I've worked closely\nwith who just test for me."},"1293":{"dur":2,"text":"If it's something that\nalready exists at the bakery,"},"1296":{"dur":1,"text":"it doesn't take that\nmany iterations,"},"1297":{"dur":1,"text":"because we already do it."},"1298":{"dur":1,"text":"It's just a matter\nof figuring out--"},"1300":{"dur":2,"text":"like sometimes as you\nreduce, reduce, reduce,"},"1303":{"dur":1,"text":"it reduces to a weird number."},"1304":{"dur":4,"text":"It reduces to like 1 cup plus\n2 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon."},"1309":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's not\nreally that usable,"},"1311":{"dur":2,"text":"so I'll have to change\nthings around and change"},"1314":{"dur":2,"text":"the proportions around just to\nmake sure that somebody at home"},"1316":{"dur":2,"text":"can actually do it."},"1318":{"dur":4,"text":"But that usually takes\nlike one, maybe two tries."},"1323":{"dur":3,"text":"But if it's a brand-new recipe,\nlike with the low sugar book,"},"1327":{"dur":2,"text":"I feel like those\nrecipes, a good recipe"},"1330":{"dur":4,"text":"would take four\niterations by me."},"1334":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's me trying it out\nand then adjusting, adjusting,"},"1336":{"dur":1,"text":"adjusting, and then by the\nfourth time being like,"},"1338":{"dur":1,"text":"OK, I think this works."},"1339":{"dur":2,"text":"Then I would give it to a baker\nand then they would do it."},"1342":{"dur":3,"text":"And usually, again, it\nwas almost the same thing"},"1345":{"dur":2,"text":"They know me well enough\nthat they would just make it."},"1348":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's like a fifth test."},"1349":{"dur":2,"text":"And then when we would\nsend it out to the testers."},"1352":{"dur":2,"text":"And usually from there,\nI would say about 80%"},"1355":{"dur":2,"text":"of the time it worked and 20%\nof the time I'd get feedback"},"1357":{"dur":1,"text":"like, this isn't really working."},"1358":{"dur":1,"text":"So then we'd adjust it."},"1360":{"dur":2,"text":"But by then, it was\nusually just one iteration,"},"1362":{"dur":2,"text":"because I would get specific\nfeedback and I would say,"},"1365":{"dur":1,"text":"ah, I knew that that\nwas going to happen."},"1366":{"dur":1,"text":"Let me adjust this."},"1368":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's a good recipe."},"1369":{"dur":2,"text":"A bad recipe-- or\nnot a bad recipe."},"1371":{"dur":1,"text":"No bad recipes."},"1372":{"dur":2,"text":"A more challenging\nrecipe, probably more"},"1375":{"dur":2,"text":"like eight or nine times."},"1377":{"dur":3,"text":"Again, because we're doing\nthings in such small--"},"1380":{"dur":2,"text":"in pastry, there are so many\nthings that you can vary,"},"1383":{"dur":3,"text":"If you have 10 ingredients in\nyour thing, in your recipe,"},"1386":{"dur":3,"text":"and you're trying to make\nit more moist or less"},"1390":{"dur":2,"text":"sweet or whatever, if you\njust adjust one thing,"},"1393":{"dur":1,"text":"it's going to affect\neverything else."},"1394":{"dur":2,"text":"So what you want to do\nis adjust everything,"},"1397":{"dur":2,"text":"but then you don't know which\none of those adjustments worked"},"1399":{"dur":0,"text":"and which one doesn't."},"1400":{"dur":2,"text":"So you have to kind of go\nslowly and say, well, I'm"},"1402":{"dur":2,"text":"just going to reduce the eggs\nfrom four eggs to three eggs"},"1405":{"dur":1,"text":"and see what happens."},"1406":{"dur":2,"text":"Then you have to wait till\nit bakes, wait till it cools,"},"1408":{"dur":2,"text":"try it, and then do it again."},"1411":{"dur":3,"text":"So it takes a lot of patience,\nbut it's a lot of fun."},"1414":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's a lot of\nmistakes along the way"},"1416":{"dur":2,"text":"that most people don't\nview as mistakes."},"1419":{"dur":1,"text":"So people like to\neat the mistakes."},"1420":{"dur":3,"text":"FEMALE SPEAKER: If you need to\ntesters for your next cookbook,"},"1424":{"dur":2,"text":"I'd be happy to send\nrecipes out to the office."},"1427":{"dur":1,"text":"Our office is very\ngood with feedback."},"1429":{"dur":4,"text":"JOANNE CHANG: If you guys\nwant to test recipes, sure."},"1433":{"dur":3,"text":"AUDIENCE: I wondered\nabout convection oven"},"1437":{"dur":2,"text":"versus conventional,\nand which is your go-to"},"1439":{"dur":3,"text":"and in what cases will you opt\nfor the other choice, and why?"},"1443":{"dur":5,"text":"JOANNE CHANG: We use mostly\nconvection at this point,"},"1449":{"dur":2,"text":"but it's for specific pastries."},"1451":{"dur":5,"text":"So for cookies,\nbrioche, muffins,"},"1457":{"dur":3,"text":"and tarts, tart shells,\nwe'll use convection."},"1460":{"dur":3,"text":"And we'll use deck ovens,\nor the still ovens,"},"1463":{"dur":2,"text":"for things like bread and cakes."},"1465":{"dur":3,"text":"And the difference--\nwith the convection,"},"1468":{"dur":1,"text":"you've got the fan\nwhirring around,"},"1470":{"dur":2,"text":"which is making the\ntemperature more consistent,"},"1473":{"dur":3,"text":"but it is introducing the\nelement of movement and air."},"1477":{"dur":3,"text":"And so for a cookie or a\nbrioche or something that's"},"1481":{"dur":2,"text":"relatively stable, I\ndon't mind that there's"},"1484":{"dur":2,"text":"air blowing around, because\nI just want it to bake,"},"1486":{"dur":1,"text":"and I want it to bake\nrelatively evenly."},"1487":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't want half\nof the brioche to be"},"1489":{"dur":2,"text":"under and half to be over."},"1491":{"dur":3,"text":"But a cake-- if you put a cake\nin a convection oven, what"},"1495":{"dur":3,"text":"tends to happen is that the cake\nstarts to cook on the outside,"},"1499":{"dur":1,"text":"because you've got\nthis whirring fan."},"1500":{"dur":3,"text":"And then the inside is\nstill needing time to cook."},"1504":{"dur":2,"text":"And so the cake will\nsometimes come out"},"1506":{"dur":1,"text":"crispier on the outside."},"1508":{"dur":3,"text":"It'll finish baking on the\noutside first, and by the time"},"1511":{"dur":3,"text":"the inside is baked it'll be\nover-baked on the outside."},"1515":{"dur":1,"text":"So we have found\nthat the still ovens"},"1517":{"dur":5,"text":"are better for baking cakes,\nbecause it's slow, steady heat."},"1522":{"dur":3,"text":"There's no air that's trying\nto basically form a crust."},"1525":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's the same with bread."},"1526":{"dur":1,"text":"If you put bread in\nthe convection oven,"},"1528":{"dur":4,"text":"the air will cause the skin\nof the bread to crust, which"},"1533":{"dur":2,"text":"means that as the yeast\nis trying to expand"},"1536":{"dur":2,"text":"and as the bread's trying\nto get big and airy,"},"1538":{"dur":2,"text":"it can't because it's\nbeen crusted over."},"1540":{"dur":3,"text":"So we prefer doing\nthat in a still oven."},"1544":{"dur":2,"text":"And then even better is if you\ncan inject some steam in it--"},"1546":{"dur":2,"text":"take a little water bottle and\nput some steam-- it creates"},"1549":{"dur":1,"text":"a really humid\nenvironment for the bread,"},"1551":{"dur":4,"text":"so then the bread dough stays\nsupple as the yeast is growing."},"1555":{"dur":3,"text":"And then it doesn't crust over\nuntil the yeast are all dead,"},"1558":{"dur":2,"text":"and then you get\nthat crust that's"},"1560":{"dur":1,"text":"characteristic of\nreally good bread."},"1562":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's how we differentiate."},"1565":{"dur":1,"text":"AUDIENCE: Great, thank you."},"1566":{"dur":1,"text":"JOANNE CHANG: You're welcome."},"1567":{"dur":0,"text":"AUDIENCE: Hi."},"1568":{"dur":1,"text":"So I had a question\nabout how you"},"1569":{"dur":1,"text":"decide which recipes to share."},"1571":{"dur":1,"text":"Do you have a\ncollection of recipes"},"1573":{"dur":2,"text":"that you're never going to share\nthat are like the secret ones?"},"1575":{"dur":1,"text":"JOANNE CHANG: Nope."},"1577":{"dur":1,"text":"The first book was\nall the recipes"},"1579":{"dur":1,"text":"that we had at the time."},"1580":{"dur":1,"text":"And then since then,\nwe've done new things."},"1582":{"dur":2,"text":"And people will say, how come\nyou didn't share this recipe?"},"1584":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'll say, because we\nhadn't made it at that point."},"1587":{"dur":1,"text":"And the same with\nthe second book."},"1589":{"dur":1,"text":"I put a bunch of salads\nin the second book,"},"1590":{"dur":2,"text":"and then we came up with a\nnew salad menu at the bakery,"},"1593":{"dur":1,"text":"and everyone's like, where's\nthe Green Goddess dressing?"},"1595":{"dur":2,"text":"And I said, oh, we\nhadn't made it by then."},"1597":{"dur":3,"text":"So the issue for us now is if\nsomebody wants a recipe that"},"1600":{"dur":1,"text":"hasn't been tested."},"1601":{"dur":2,"text":"I can give you the recipe to\nmake like 10 gallons of Green"},"1604":{"dur":2,"text":"Goddess, and if you want\nto do the math-- or I"},"1607":{"dur":2,"text":"can do the math as well and\njust give it to you in grams."},"1610":{"dur":5,"text":"But I don't have home-friendly\nrecipes for everything,"},"1615":{"dur":2,"text":"so that's usually\nthe limiting factor."},"1617":{"dur":1,"text":"If somebody says,\nI love this recipe."},"1619":{"dur":3,"text":"I'll just say to them, I can\ngive it to you in the big batch"},"1622":{"dur":3,"text":"and I can do the math, just\ndivided it by 50 or whatever."},"1626":{"dur":2,"text":"But depending on\nyour comfort level,"},"1628":{"dur":2,"text":"you can either use it\nor it won't really help."},"1631":{"dur":2,"text":"So I don't really\nfeel like recipes"},"1634":{"dur":6,"text":"are meant to be-- I feel like\nrecipes are meant to be shared."},"1640":{"dur":1,"text":"A lot of that\ncomes from the fact"},"1641":{"dur":3,"text":"that we obviously use the same\nrecipe at the bakery for all"},"1645":{"dur":1,"text":"of our items."},"1646":{"dur":3,"text":"Every baker has access\nto the big recipe book."},"1649":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's crazy\nthe variation that"},"1651":{"dur":2,"text":"comes, even though\neverything is weighed"},"1654":{"dur":4,"text":"to the gram and everything is\ntimed almost to the second."},"1658":{"dur":2,"text":"And yet, we will still\nhave huge variations."},"1661":{"dur":2,"text":"Because to me, baking\nisn't just about-- I mean,"},"1664":{"dur":1,"text":"everyone talks about\nhow baking is chemistry"},"1666":{"dur":0,"text":"and it's so precise."},"1667":{"dur":3,"text":"And it is, but it's also\nso much about who you are"},"1670":{"dur":2,"text":"and what you put into it, and\nhow you're feeling that day."},"1673":{"dur":1,"text":"I know this sounds\nvery touchy-feely,"},"1674":{"dur":3,"text":"but I really feel like\npastry is something"},"1677":{"dur":2,"text":"that you can tell if\nsomebody's doing it right"},"1680":{"dur":1,"text":"and doing it well."},"1681":{"dur":4,"text":"And so giving somebody the\nrecipe isn't the secret."},"1685":{"dur":2,"text":"It's all the\nthought and the care"},"1687":{"dur":2,"text":"and the attention that goes into\nmaking it that's the secret."},"1690":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'm happy
