{"6":{"dur":4,"text":"- Welcome to Insight. Today we are\nchatting with Guillaume Dufresnoy,"},"10":{"dur":5,"text":"Artistic Director of the Big Apple Circus.\nThe Big Apple Circus is an award-winning"},"16":{"dur":3,"text":"presenter of live family entertainment\nthat is also dedicated to outreach"},"20":{"dur":4,"text":"programs and healthcare facilities and\ncommunities across the nation. Guillaume"},"24":{"dur":2,"text":"has generously agreed to share some\nof his experience with us."},"26":{"dur":2,"text":"I'd like to thank you\nGuillaume, for joining us today."},"28":{"dur":1,"text":"- Pleasure to be here."},"30":{"dur":3,"text":"- So the circus is a great topic. It's a\ngreat topic in terms of complexity of"},"34":{"dur":5,"text":"management, the complexity of the art, the\ndiversity of the artists. Let's start"},"40":{"dur":4,"text":"talking about how do you create\nthe art of the circus."},"44":{"dur":8,"text":"- Well, basically what we do is that we\ntap into world class artists. And the way"},"53":{"dur":6,"text":"that business is organized is that artists\nwork many years into developing one act,"},"60":{"dur":7,"text":"and then with that act they go from circus\nto circus. So it's not the other model"},"68":{"dur":4,"text":"that some people have in mind of, of\nfamily or small group that stays year"},"72":{"dur":5,"text":"after year together and try to do\nsomething different every year. We tap a"},"78":{"dur":5,"text":"completely different class of artists. So\nthe way I usually work is that I pick a"},"84":{"dur":7,"text":"director who will come and stage the show.\nAnd with that director, we collaborate on"},"92":{"dur":7,"text":"picking the creative team and then a\nroster of artists that would fit a theme."},"100":{"dur":6,"text":"We keep it simple. We're not about making\na huge production. We're not about telling"},"107":{"dur":6,"text":"very complicated stories. We're really\nabout delivering in a well-produced"},"113":{"dur":8,"text":"way but in an intimate and very direct way\nthe best possible circus arts."},"122":{"dur":5,"text":"- And you're an arts presenter and so the\nprocess is to create an immersive"},"127":{"dur":6,"text":"experience for the audience so that the\nart can be presented in a way that creates"},"134":{"dur":4,"text":"that sort of concentrated experience\nwithout the complexities perhaps, without"},"139":{"dur":5,"text":"the bells and whistles that can sometimes\nbe so distracting from"},"144":{"dur":4,"text":"the art that is being presented\nby the artist him\/herself."},"149":{"dur":3,"text":"- Yeah absolutely. I think we have three\nelements that work for us that we are"},"153":{"dur":4,"text":"absolutely attached to. One, we're\nperforming the round, which gives the"},"158":{"dur":4,"text":"sense of the group and the community. You\nare with your family watching the show but"},"163":{"dur":6,"text":"you also can observe across the ring,\nwhich is only 40 feet. You can observe"},"169":{"dur":4,"text":"other members of your community, laughing\nat the same time, being in awe at the same"},"174":{"dur":6,"text":"time. So that part is really the first\nconnection. The second connection is"},"180":{"dur":5,"text":"that the size of the tent is such that we\npreserve intimacy. Nobody is seated more"},"186":{"dur":5,"text":"than like 50 feet of the ring, and\ncompared to some other spectacles, that"},"192":{"dur":6,"text":"brings you into the action, no matter\nwhat. And then the third aspect is that as"},"198":{"dur":8,"text":"you mentioned, we do not put emphasis on\nproduction gimmicks. We don't put masks on"},"207":{"dur":5,"text":"artists. We want to see a human being that\ndoes extraordinary things, but at the same"},"212":{"dur":5,"text":"time when you observe that artist, you\nknow exactly that it's a person who put"},"217":{"dur":2,"text":"their pants on this morning\none leg at a time."},"220":{"dur":4,"text":"- So let's move away from the day of the\nperformance and let's move all the way"},"225":{"dur":5,"text":"back in time to when you're just thinking\nabout a concept. How does that work? How"},"230":{"dur":4,"text":"do you arrive at the concepts that you're\nputting together? I'm sure you have an"},"234":{"dur":4,"text":"annual schedule as a presenter. But how do\nyou arrive at that germ of the"},"239":{"dur":4,"text":"idea and then start to fill\nthat idea with life?"},"244":{"dur":5,"text":"- Well, we just use the time machine that\nputs us back three years before, three to"},"249":{"dur":9,"text":"four years. But I like to use three years\nahead of time. The idea of a show can come"},"259":{"dur":9,"text":"different ways. It's a chicken and\negg kind of question. What I like to"},"269":{"dur":5,"text":"start with is with a director, someone\nwho is not necessarily experienced in"},"275":{"dur":5,"text":"directing circus because I like a fresh\nlook, but also somebody who is interested"},"280":{"dur":8,"text":"into getting into the world of circus.\nI would not be quite as excited to hire"},"289":{"dur":5,"text":"someone who has already a preconceived\nidea. \"I wanna do my circus over there.\" I'm"},"295":{"dur":4,"text":"much more interested in somebody who says,\n\"Look, I don't know much about circus. I"},"299":{"dur":6,"text":"enjoy it and I have a perception of the\nBig Apple Circus and its soul, its"},"306":{"dur":5,"text":"character, its mission, all of that. And\nis there a way here that we can have a"},"312":{"dur":7,"text":"project together?\" That's the best way.\nThen usually, it's the director who comes"},"319":{"dur":6,"text":"up with an idea. It can be fairly vague,\nbut comes up with an idea. Then we work"},"326":{"dur":7,"text":"together, just the director and I on\nrefining it. I really enjoy taking directors to"},"334":{"dur":5,"text":"circus festivals or to other circuses. So\nwe start to get a sense of what kind of"},"340":{"dur":5,"text":"acts we like, what are we pursuing for\nthat specific production. Then we pick a"},"345":{"dur":7,"text":"creative team. And as we do this, we write... it's an outline of a show. And"},"353":{"dur":6,"text":"it can be a period show, it can be focused\non a location, like we did this year with"},"359":{"dur":5,"text":"Times Square.\nFocused performance next year will be"},"365":{"dur":6,"text":"about metamorphosis, changes, magic. We had\nthe year before that was really the roots"},"372":{"dur":8,"text":"of the American Big Top, 1825. It was a\nreally period show. Except for one piece"},"381":{"dur":4,"text":"of music, we really stayed true to the\nperiod. So this is really the way it"},"385":{"dur":6,"text":"works. And because of the way the casting\nrhythms are and cycles, I really need"},"392":{"dur":8,"text":"to book the acts two years in advance. And\nthen as soon as we open one show, we start"},"400":{"dur":4,"text":"the real production work of the next one.\nSo those are production meetings but by"},"404":{"dur":4,"text":"then, we kind of know what\nthe show will be."},"409":{"dur":4,"text":"- And it's a scripting process but it's\nnot prescriptive. It's very interactive."},"414":{"dur":4,"text":"You're shaping together with your\ncollaborator and then as you start to"},"419":{"dur":8,"text":"consider what acts as you cast the show,\nthose players are also going to have some"},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"things to contribute to your\nconcept as well."},"430":{"dur":5,"text":"- Yeah, what I think is crucial is that we\nare not about the theme, we are not about"},"435":{"dur":4,"text":"the story, we are not about the director,\nwe are not about me. We are about the acts."},"440":{"dur":7,"text":"We're about the circus acts. And one thing\nthat I always really insist on is, with any"},"447":{"dur":5,"text":"director, no matter the theme, no matter\nthe plan, if suddenly we have not booked"},"453":{"dur":4,"text":"everybody and I run into a fantastic\ncircus act that happens"},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"to be available,\nthat act will be in the show."},"460":{"dur":4,"text":"- So it's the frame that is created, but\nit's a frame for presenting the acts--"},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"- That's right.\n- presenting that art."},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"- It's about presenting circus acts.\nOur audience"},"469":{"dur":5,"text":"comes to see circus acts, circus\ntricks, circus thrills. There's absolutely"},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"no doubt about that. Yes,\nwe present it well."},"478":{"dur":4,"text":"Yes, we give unity to the production\nwith music, with costume,"},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"with the set, with what\nthe ring master will say."},"485":{"dur":4,"text":"And we're very proud of that, I don't want\nto diminish. But ultimately,"},"489":{"dur":3,"text":"we are about the circus tricks."},"493":{"dur":6,"text":"- And every show is a risk. Every show,\nthere is a threat of failure. Because if"},"499":{"dur":4,"text":"you're just repeating what constantly was\nsuccessful in the past, you can be sure"},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"of one thing, you won't necessarily be\nthe thing that's embraced in the future."},"507":{"dur":4,"text":"- Well, one of the challenges that we have\nat the Big Apple Circus is that we have a"},"512":{"dur":6,"text":"very high rate of return. We have families\nwho come in year after year. I think 60 or"},"519":{"dur":7,"text":"70% of our audience has seen the show in\nthe last two years. So one of the elements"},"527":{"dur":3,"text":"of quality that we bring is not only the\nquality of this production but it's only"},"530":{"dur":5,"text":"the fact that it's completely different\nfrom the past ones and the next one will"},"536":{"dur":5,"text":"be completely different as well. So, it's\nreally coming up with brand new concept"},"541":{"dur":6,"text":"every year. And that's why it's so\nimportant to have different creative teams"},"548":{"dur":5,"text":"to bring you that kind of inspiration year\nin and year out."},"553":{"dur":4,"text":"- And you also have full-time artists on\nstaff. You have your musicians, you have"},"558":{"dur":6,"text":"others who are going to be on your staff\nand part of your team show after show. How"},"565":{"dur":4,"text":"do you make the decision what\ncompetencies, what qualities you want to"},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"retain on staff, and what qualities you\nwould like to bring"},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"in and refresh show\nafter show after show?"},"576":{"dur":3,"text":"- Well, what I think, yes, the band is\npretty much set, although they have substitutes,"},"580":{"dur":6,"text":"but the musical director is a key element\nof the team. And we're fortunate that he"},"586":{"dur":6,"text":"has been here for years and hopefully will\nstay for many more. As far as the artists,"},"593":{"dur":5,"text":"there has been an evolution in the history\nof the Big Apple Circus. There was really"},"599":{"dur":8,"text":"a fairly large number of core company\nmembers... we have up to five or"},"607":{"dur":6,"text":"seven. That way year after year and\npracticing new acts and"},"613":{"dur":4,"text":"I have taken a slightly\ndifferent direction with this."},"619":{"dur":7,"text":"Because it's absolutely impossible for\nperformers to develop every year a"},"627":{"dur":4,"text":"different act that technically is of the\nsame level as someone"},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"who spends five or ten\nyears developing one act."},"635":{"dur":5,"text":"And the standards have certainly evolved\nwith the access to the internet. Anybody"},"641":{"dur":5,"text":"can look at the best circus acts in the\nworld. So you're facing an audience that"},"647":{"dur":6,"text":"knows the business very well, and to be\nable to really bring the best and amaze"},"653":{"dur":4,"text":"that audience I need to bring the best\npossible performers, the best possible"},"658":{"dur":5,"text":"acts that have been developed. So the path\nthat I have chosen for now is that I'm"},"664":{"dur":5,"text":"keeping the ringmaster as a recognizable\ncharacter and he's under contract for"},"670":{"dur":6,"text":"several years now and our animal trainer\nis also staying on a multi-year contract,"},"676":{"dur":5,"text":"although she has the charge of coming up\nwith different acts every year. And what"},"682":{"dur":5,"text":"I'm aiming at is finding the right balance\nbetween familiarity"},"689":{"dur":7,"text":"and new and exciting and high-level acts.\nAnd that's the path that I'm trying now,"},"697":{"dur":3,"text":"and let's see how that works."},"700":{"dur":4,"text":"- So you end up with a flexibly\nconfigurable refreshed experience that"},"705":{"dur":5,"text":"allows your jaded audience to not be jaded\nbecause they are those that have purchased"},"710":{"dur":3,"text":"tickets for the last three years are going\nto come back this year and see something"},"714":{"dur":4,"text":"new. They'll see new performers, a\nrefreshed sensibility and perhaps things"},"719":{"dur":0,"text":"that they've never seen before."},"720":{"dur":2,"text":"- Hopefully things they have\nnever seen before."},"723":{"dur":5,"text":"And at the same time, they will have the\npleasure of seeing John Kennedy Kane or"},"728":{"dur":3,"text":"Jen Yvette Bell again and they will, \"Oh,\ngreat! Look at what she did this year"},"732":{"dur":3,"text":"compared to what she did last year.\"\nThat creates"},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"another level of connection,\nthat familiarity."},"739":{"dur":6,"text":"- What is the interaction between the arts\nside and the business side like? Because"},"745":{"dur":6,"text":"you are going to be to a certain extent\ndependent on ticket sales and financial"},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"management and budgets\nand all those things."},"755":{"dur":5,"text":"- Well, I think the one thing that's very\nimportant is that being not-for-profit,"},"761":{"dur":6,"text":"the Big Apple Circus is very attached to\nthe quality of its programs, all of them."},"767":{"dur":8,"text":"The unit production as well as the\ncommunity programs. And the means to put"},"776":{"dur":5,"text":"together the best possible programs, or\nreally finding those means is really a"},"781":{"dur":4,"text":"priority. The way we function, I'm an\nequal to the Executive Director Lynn"},"786":{"dur":8,"text":"Stirrup and together we really manage the\norganization and set the objectives"},"795":{"dur":6,"text":"working with the board at the governance\nlevel. The budget is pretty much set quite"},"801":{"dur":5,"text":"a bit in advance because of the same\ndifficult times that everybody has had in"},"807":{"dur":3,"text":"the arts. Budgets have been flat in the\nlast few years."},"811":{"dur":2,"text":"- Plus you have a three-year planning\ncycle as well."},"813":{"dur":3,"text":"- Plus you have a three-year planning\ncycle. But I have been fortunate once"},"817":{"dur":6,"text":"again that the Board has been absolutely\n100% behind not cutting the production"},"824":{"dur":5,"text":"budget and not cutting the program budget\neither, because everybody believes in the"},"830":{"dur":3,"text":"mission. And I think that would be a huge\ndifference in the for-profit world,"},"833":{"dur":1,"text":"my budget would have been slashed."},"835":{"dur":5,"text":"- How did you get to the point where\nyou're undertaking this task at this time"},"841":{"dur":2,"text":"of your career?\nTalk about your own career trajectory and"},"844":{"dur":3,"text":"your own evolution as an artist and as an\narts presenter."},"847":{"dur":8,"text":"- Well, I came to the circus by accident.\nBasically, my first girlfriend, who was my"},"856":{"dur":3,"text":"high-school sweetheart, you would say\nhere, was a gymnast and a circus"},"860":{"dur":4,"text":"aficionado, and when I left the French\nNavy I went to live with her in Paris and"},"865":{"dur":8,"text":"it was really a good ol' Gypsy life. And\nshe introduced me to a place where a"},"874":{"dur":5,"text":"retired circus performer was training\npeople on trapeze. And it's that gentleman"},"879":{"dur":7,"text":"who kind of out of, not kind of completely\nout of the blue came up to me one day and"},"887":{"dur":3,"text":"say, \"Hey, you don't wanna put an act\ntogether? Your girlfriend is in a circus"},"890":{"dur":2,"text":"school.\" And I was like, \"Moi?\"\n- Moi?"},"894":{"dur":4,"text":"- And so I said, \"You know, you're 21. You\nthink you'll never die.\" So I said, \"All"},"899":{"dur":5,"text":"right. I'll try.\" And that's how I got\ninto the business. I created a few years"},"905":{"dur":2,"text":"later, it was a different girl, we don't\nwant that story,"},"908":{"dur":4,"text":"a different area and act, and it was\nthat second act, I was a catcher,"},"913":{"dur":7,"text":"that Paul Binder saw us work at\nthe French National Circus and hired us."},"921":{"dur":5,"text":"So I came to the States in 1987. It was my\nrigging of partner in a three-months"},"927":{"dur":4,"text":"contract to work for the Big Apple\nCircus, and they have"},"931":{"dur":2,"text":"never gotten rid of me since then."},"933":{"dur":4,"text":"- So talk about the work that you do on\nhealthcare facilities and then"},"938":{"dur":1,"text":"communities outside of the tent."},"939":{"dur":6,"text":"- So basically, the idea is that the live\nperformance of circus arts does not need"},"946":{"dur":5,"text":"to be necessarily in the ring. And what\nhappens in the ring, the same direct"},"952":{"dur":4,"text":"performance, the same contact, the same\nrespect from the audience, the same level"},"957":{"dur":6,"text":"of skills, we bring in other places.\nSo we have developed a group of"},"964":{"dur":7,"text":"professional hospital clowns that work at\nthe moment in 14 pediatric hospitals"},"972":{"dur":6,"text":"nationwide. And basically, we spearheaded\nthe profession of hospital clowning. It"},"978":{"dur":7,"text":"was Michael Christiansen who came up with\nthe idea. And we have become specialists"},"986":{"dur":6,"text":"at it. What's very interesting is that,\nand I like to go on clowning rounds with"},"992":{"dur":7,"text":"them just to see the work and to see the\nenvironment and to see the impact."},"999":{"dur":6,"text":"So these performers have their\nartist skills but they also train in tons"},"1006":{"dur":7,"text":"of hospital procedure, hygiene, patient\nprivacy, tons of things. And then they are"},"1013":{"dur":9,"text":"facing an audience that is in a very tough\nsetting and who has not chosen to come see"},"1023":{"dur":7,"text":"them but the clowns are there and they\nshow up. And the first thing they do is"},"1031":{"dur":4,"text":"they ask permission to come into the room\nbecause it's probably the only time that"},"1036":{"dur":5,"text":"week that the kid who is a patient is\nempowered to say yes or no to anything."},"1043":{"dur":8,"text":"And once they get a yes, the second\nwonderful ability that they have is what"},"1052":{"dur":5,"text":"we call \"read the room.\" And they feel\nvery rapidly what the energy is"},"1057":{"dur":9,"text":"from the kid, from the nurse, from the\nparents and they adapt and react and go"},"1067":{"dur":6,"text":"with that. And it's never an in-your-face\nperformance, \"This is what I do.\" This is,"},"1074":{"dur":6,"text":"\"How about this?\" \"How about that?\" and if\nit doesn't work, we step back and always"},"1080":{"dur":5,"text":"with aiming at, again, a connection\nand a skill."},"1086":{"dur":1,"text":"- It's the moment of dialogue."},"1088":{"dur":6,"text":"- It's a real dialogue and you empower the\nkid, which remain absolutely crucial. But"},"1094":{"dur":8,"text":"in the course of one round, when maybe the\nclowns visit 10, 15 rooms, they reach so"},"1103":{"dur":5,"text":"many people. Because you reach all the\nparents, all the staff and if you walk"},"1109":{"dur":4,"text":"behind him, you see, you know, the\nsecurity guard who is really bored on his"},"1113":{"dur":5,"text":"chair, and the person who is cleaning the\nrooms and is having a hard time and"},"1119":{"dur":5,"text":"suddenly they pay attention. They listen\nto the clown. They get a smile. It"},"1124":{"dur":5,"text":"completely changes. It transforms the\natmosphere of the floor so quickly."},"1130":{"dur":3,"text":"- What is in store for the Big Apple\nCircus over the next years?"},"1134":{"dur":9,"text":"- Well, what I think is we have a great\nknow-how, both on the production side and"},"1143":{"dur":6,"text":"on the community program side. So the\ndream is to really bring that know-how to"},"1150":{"dur":6,"text":"more places. Our community programs are\nvery scalable. All of them can be"},"1157":{"dur":4,"text":"developed easily, not at a very high\ncost and in many locations."},"1162":{"dur":1,"text":"- Very high impact."},"1163":{"dur":7,"text":"- Very high impact. I think it's a very\nhigh return for not a huge investment, for"},"1171":{"dur":7,"text":"a high reward for our funder. On the\nproduction side, we will remain with one"},"1178":{"dur":6,"text":"Big Top and one main production, but we are\nreally looking at opportunities to bring"},"1186":{"dur":6,"text":"the same kind of production with the same\nqualities to different venues. It could"},"1193":{"dur":6,"text":"be a theater. We put a show a few years\nago in Abu Dhabi in a huge convention"},"1200":{"dur":5,"text":"center and we were able, just by the\nlayout of the place, to bring the intimacy"},"1205":{"dur":6,"text":"back and present circus acts and circus arts\nthe way these audience have never seen."},"1212":{"dur":6,"text":"So I think I'm really excited about other\nopportunities where we remain ourselves"},"1218":{"dur":3,"text":"but simply do it inside the\ndifferent venues."},"1221":{"dur":4,"text":"- With an unconstrained vision and\nunconstrained joy, Guillaume Dufresnoy,"},"1226":{"dur":4,"text":"thank you so much for sharing your\nexperience with us, for sharing the Big"},"1231":{"dur":3,"text":"Apple Circus with us, and thank you so\nmuch for your insights."},"1234":{"dur":2,"text":"- You're very welcome.
