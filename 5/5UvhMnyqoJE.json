I wanted to start by asking each of you"},"48":{"dur":2,"text":"to define healthy aging."},"50":{"dur":2,"text":"I know, from talking to you,"},"53":{"dur":1,"text":"and we've seen from the

aging"},"59":{"dur":2,"text":"when someone says that to you?"},"61":{"dur":1,"text":"- I have to start with a little story"},"63":{"dur":3,"text":"which is that my mom was\na very powerful woman"},"67":{"dur":1,"text":"who was used to being in control,"},"69":{"dur":3,"text":"and when she went through\nthe end of life processes,"},"72":{"dur":3,"text":"she became a victim of aging,"},"75":{"dur":4,"text":"and I realized that she had not been doing"},"79":{"dur":2,"text":"the kind of spiritual work\nand personal growth work"},"82":{"dur":1,"text":"that I've been doing all my life,"},"84":{"dur":2,"text":"and I determined at that point"},"86":{"dur":4,"text":"that there must be a better\nway to go through aging"},"91":{"dur":1,"text":"than how she did it, and so for me,"},"92":{"dur":3,"text":"successful aging has a\nvery deep psychological"},"95":{"dur":2,"text":"and spiritual component to it."},"98":{"dur":3,"text":"- And it's sound like\nmaybe some of that involves"},"101":{"dur":4,"text":"being in control of the decisions\nthat are made around that."},"106":{"dur":2,"text":"- I suppose so, but for\nme, the emphasis is really"},"109":{"dur":4,"text":"how to live through the end of your life"},"114":{"dur":2,"text":"when things are out of your control."},"116":{"dur":2,"text":"It has to do with acceptance,\nand it

things"},"137":{"dur":3,"text":"physically different to\nimpact the aging process?"},"140":{"dur":2,"text":"- Well, I think as long\nas you can be physical"},"143":{"dur":2,"text":"and as long as you

part"},"197":{"dur":1,"text":"with some of your patients,"},"199":{"dur":4,"text":"so what do you tell\npeople healthy aging is?"},"203":{"dur":1,"text":"How do you describe it?"},"204":{"dur":1,"text":"- Well, I think it has several components."},"206":{"dur":3,"text":"I think the most important\nthing is adjustment"},"209":{"dur":3,"text":"to changing roles and\nchanging circumstances"},"213":{"dur":2,"text":"that you're gonna encounter with aging"},"216":{"dur":3,"text":"whether it's 68 or 88."},"220":{"dur":2,"text":"I think, secondly, it's\ncrucially

you've\ngotta keep pedaling.\""},"232":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think the third\nimportant aspect of aging"},"235":{"dur":4,"text":"is to stay engaged with a social network"},"241":{"dur":2,"text":"and to have a social persona"},"244":{"dur":4,"text":"which interacts with a\nvariety of other people."},"248":{"dur":3,"text":"- Okay, well speaking of keeping pedaling"},"251":{"dur":4,"text":"or continuing to pedal, Janet\ncertainly is a model for that."},"256":{"dur":3,"text":"So when people ask you\nwhat is healthy aging,"},"259":{"dur":2,"text":"and not everybody can\nachieve the goals you have,"},"262":{"dur":1,"text":"but what do you say?"},"263":{"dur":0,"text":"- Well, I agree."},"264":{"dur":1,"text":"There're just so many\ndifferent components,"},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"and it means different\nthings to different people"},"268":{"dur":3,"text":"in their lives, but I think starting out,"},"271":{"dur":3,"text":"it's just having very mutually\nsupportive relationships,"},"274":{"dur":4,"text":"real good exercise and\nfitness and healthy nutrition,"},"279":{"dur":5,"text":"trying new things, have a very\nsignificant purpose in life,"},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"and just the courage and the perseverance"},"288":{"dur":4,"text":"to keep on keeping on, and\nwhen you experience setbacks"},"293":{"dur":2,"text":"and issues that

have"},"315":{"dur":3,"text":"a very positive outlook live,\non average, 7 1\/2 years longer"},"319":{"dur":3,"text":"than people who complain a\nlot and are more negative."},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"- Okay, all good advice."},"325":{"dur":4,"text":"I think one of the things that\na lot of people want to know"},"329":{"dur":1,"text":"because I was talking\nwith some of my coworkers"},"331":{"dur":4,"text":"about this is, and this relates\nto something that was said"},"335":{"dur":3,"text":"in the documentary about\nadapting to your limitations."},"339":{"dur":3,"text":"So it would be great if there\nwas some kind of little guide"},"342":{"dur":1,"text":"like there is when you have children"},"344":{"dur":2,"text":"and they say,

adapt to this\nbecause my vision is changing--"},"364":{"dur":3,"text":"- Well the problem is that\npeople age at different rates,"},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"and it doesn't start in the 60s."},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"It actually starts in the 20s."},"371":{"dur":4,"text":"Many people age in a very different,"},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"at a very different rate than others"},"378":{"dur":3,"text":"so that the number really\ndoesn't make a whole lot of--"},"381":{"dur":1,"text":"- Maybe there're markers to look for."},"383":{"dur":0,"text":"- Exactly."},"384":{"dur":5,"text":"I think changes in work,\nchanges in family relationships,"},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"changes in physical activity, obviously"},"392":{"dur":5,"text":"are gonna be very big,\nbut we really don't know"},"397":{"dur":3,"text":"how well some people can age."},"401":{"dur":3,"text":"We're stuck back in a situation"},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"where I think we don't expect enough"},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"from people who are aging."},"409":{"dur":4,"text":"In ancient Rome, the\nlife expectancy was 28."},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"In 1900, it was 47."},"417":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, it's gonna be over 80 now for women,"},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"slightly less than that for men,"},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"but we need to, I think, have a lot more"},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"emphasis on what people\nare capable of doing."},"430":{"dur":3,"text":"As Janet's trying to operate,\nto get people physically"},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"active and intellectually active."},"437":{"dur":3,"text":"- Okay, you know Carol, you\ntalked in the documentary"},"440":{"dur":3,"text":"some about perceptions\nand attitudes about aging,"},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"just what Dr. Petrie has just touched on"},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"and sort of our culture around aging."},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"Do you have any thoughts about that,"},"451":{"dur":4,"text":"and it definitely has\nevolved but I'm not sure"},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"you're completely happy still\nwith how people perceive--"},"458":{"dur":3,"text":"- Well, I guess I'm gonna\nhave to play devil's advocate"},"461":{"dur":3,"text":"just a little bit because\nwe certainly don't want"},"465":{"dur":3,"text":"to marginalize older\npeople and let them have"},"469":{"dur":5,"text":"that slow, sad decline into\ndepression that I think,"},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"again that was my mother's expectation"},"476":{"dur":1,"text":"and I think a previous

busy and productive"},"487":{"dur":3,"text":"and reinventing ourselves all the time."},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's this new thing happening called"},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"the Conscious Aging\nMovement that my book and"},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"a number of us are sort of\npopping up talking about"},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"and that is, at least for\nthe boomer generation,"},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"so many of us have had a\ncontemplative practice for years."},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"We've been trying to strip away our egos"},"509":{"dur":1,"text":"and be in the present moment"},"511":{"dur":3,"text":"and enjoy sitting by the\nriverbank or whatever,"},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"and we're finally, we've\nworked so hard for so long."},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"Some of us would like to just have"},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"part of the definition\nof successful aging,"},"523":{"dur":4,"text":"the notion that we can, in\naddition to when we feel called"},"527":{"dur":3,"text":"to produce and to be\nactive, that it's okay."},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"We have the freedom also to\nenjoy the present moment."},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"And especially, with the very aged,"},"537":{"dur":1,"text":"that woman on the park bench,"},"539":{"dur":1,"text":"we may have to call social services."},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"She may be depressed, but\nshe also may be having"},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"a transcendent experience,"},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"so I'm just trying to open\nit up just a little bit."},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"- I wonder how much\nthough might be cultural"},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"because I can remember growing up"},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"and seeing some of the elders."},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"I grew up in the south, so\npeople sat on their porches"},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"in the evening and that\nwas a social thing."},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"Sometimes, they would sit there,"},"562":{"dur":4,"text":"but there was also a different\nlevel of respect I think"},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"for those who did, and I\nremember my friends and I"},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"really engaging with some\nof those older people"},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"in a very respectful and healthy way."},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"So some of this may be driven by how we"},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"see people who are growing older."},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"Would you agree, Janet that"},"581":{"dur":4,"text":"it's that expectation\nin our western culture"},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"that you've got to\nstill be busy and active"},"589":{"dur":4,"text":"and doing something as opposed\nto sitting on your porch?"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"- When I was 20, I thought\nLord if you were over 30,"},"595":{"dur":1,"text":"you were over the hill."},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was even trying\nto decide how I would go"},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"professionally, whether I\nwould go into recreational and"},"602":{"dur":4,"text":"physical therapy kinds of\nthings or whether I would go"},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"into psychology or some other field,"},"608":{"dur":1,"text":"and I just figured at the time,"},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Well probably my mind is\ngonna outlast my body.\""},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"Somehow, I just had this feeling"},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"that boy, that body is\nreally

people"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"who are in their 90s and 100 years old"},"625":{"dur":3,"text":"who are still very active\nand physically capable,"},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"and I think it's something\nthat Dr. Petrie said too."},"631":{"dur":3,"text":"I think many people short sell themselves"},"634":{"dur":1,"text":"about what they can accomplish"},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"and as they have one\nsetback, then they think,"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Okay, well I can't do this any longer.\""},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"And the world just becomes\nsmaller and smaller"},"644":{"dur":3,"text":"and smaller until you\nhave someone who's alone"},"648":{"dur":3,"text":"in a room and just needing\nall kinds of support."},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"So if there are ways\nto help people realize,"},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"I know Peter Pressman who's president"},"657":{"dur":1,"text":"of the Nashville Striders always says,"},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"\"It's not how far

his knee."},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"I think if he's like\nmost of the other people"},"678":{"dur":3,"text":"that I relate to, he'll\nfigure out that he can swim"},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"or he can do other things or he can coach"},"684":{"dur":3,"text":"or there's some other thing that he can do"},"687":{"dur":3,"text":"to be worthwhile unless your self-esteem"},"691":{"dur":4,"text":"is totally tied up in that."},"695":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, I know that most\npsychiatrists know this,"},"698":{"dur":3,"text":"that athletes are the hardest to treat"},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"when it comes to

gonna\nhave to reconcile this."},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughs)"},"722":{"dur":1,"text":"You've got two different\nperspectives here."},"724":{"dur":1,"text":"- Let me say this."},"725":{"dur":1,"text":"Let me say this."},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"I think the problem that\nI have is that we have"},"729":{"dur":3,"text":"an extremely sedentary lifestyle,"},"732":{"dur":4,"text":"and in America today, it's very unhealthy."},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"You can't walk a lot of places."},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"Most people fill up their\ndays with

issue\nis, you've got to retain"},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"some of that independence and I think"},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"we've got to come up with innovative ways"},"790":{"dur":4,"text":"of keeping people\ntogether, walking together,"},"795":{"dur":4,"text":"studying together, learning\ntogether, worshiping together"},"799":{"dur":3,"text":"because the trend that\nyou see with older

about that\nin terms of exercise,"},"844":{"dur":3,"text":"physical activity, actually\nbeing more beneficial"},"847":{"dur":2,"text":"than the brain games that\nwe were talking

you're against"},"858":{"dur":2,"text":"physical activity and\nwalking, but I think maybe"},"861":{"dur":4,"text":"what you're saying is, \"Don't\ndisregard the importance"},"865":{"dur":3,"text":"of those who choose to sit on their porch"},"869":{"dur":3,"text":"to use the analogy that I gave, at times"},"873":{"dur":2,"text":"and just enjoy where they are in life,"},"876":{"dur":1,"text":"but maybe I'm wrong."},"877":{"dur":1,"text":"Tell me what you think about--"},"878":{"dur":2,"text":"- No, and I think you\nhad a really good point."},"881":{"dur":2,"text":"The really important point,

is"},"928":{"dur":2,"text":"that at every spiritual\nand mystical practice,"},"931":{"dur":4,"text":"they were always talking\nabout loss of ego,"},"935":{"dur":4,"text":"transcending

us."},"958":{"dur":4,"text":"And can we look at aging\nas a spiritual opportunity?"},"964":{"dur":2,"text":"Not just a panacea we throw at a problem,"},"966":{"dur":2,"text":"so I totally believe, I
