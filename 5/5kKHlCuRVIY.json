to do\nwith any vanity metric."},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"Vanity metrics are\nnot real word metrics."},"393":{"dur":3,"text":"And how I know this is\nbecause I did some

channels."},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"Anyone here watch\nthe Machinima video?"},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a bunch of game play,\noftentimes people narrating"},"422":{"dur":1,"text":"over Minecraft."},"423":{"dur":2,"text":"And so imagine instead of\nwatching a football game"},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"with the announcers, that\nsomeone's playing Minecraft"},"428":{"dur":1,"text":"and telling funny\nstories about their life."},"430":{"dur":1,"text":"They're called vlogs."},"431":{"dur":0,"text":"Video logs."},"432":{"dur":1,"text":"They're really big in YouTube."},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"So these gamers that had\nhundreds of thousands"},"435":{"dur":3,"text":"of subscribers would make\nvideos playing Minecraft,"},"439":{"dur":3,"text":"just educating people about the\nworld that was in Minecraft."},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"And in aggregate,\nthese influencers"},"445":{"dur":3,"text":"with less celebrity\nfollowers like these mascots"},"448":{"dur":4,"text":"up here, they were influencers\nbecause in their communities"},"452":{"dur":3,"text":"in clusters of five to 10, these\ninfluencers moved the needle."},"455":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think people like\nSeacrest, people like Kim"},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"Kardashian, they add value."},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"They drive traffic."},"462":{"dur":1,"text":"People watch their TV shows."},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"They're cultural taste makers."},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"But they are not true\nsocial media influencers,"},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"because again, the\nword has been hijacked."},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"And they aren't no-talent zeros\nlike a lot of these influencers"},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"are on Instagram, because\nthey do add value."},"476":{"dur":1,"text":"But ultimately I\nwant to show you"},"477":{"dur":3,"text":"the data around why they're\nnot influential online."},"481":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is a slide\nliterally I made years ago"},"484":{"dur":1,"text":"when I was working\ndoing research"},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"on celebrity investments\nand startups,"},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"and how they move the\nneedle, because again,"},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"every Silicon Valley\nproduct, they want"},"492":{"dur":1,"text":"to connect with a celebrity."},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"And they say, I\nwant to get someone"},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"to tweet about my product."},"496":{"dur":1,"text":"It will be an overnight success."},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"And that is wrong."},"499":{"dur":1,"text":"Celebrities don't\nmove the needle"},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"as much as very targeted,\nspecific niche influencers."},"504":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is Kim."},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"When she had a tweet, again,\nI ripped this directly"},"508":{"dur":3,"text":"from a deck I made years ago."},"512":{"dur":3,"text":"Anyone here familiar with Bitly,\nthe data tracking software"},"515":{"dur":1,"text":"you can use to share links?"},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"So she shared an\nepisode of \"Keeping up"},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"with the Kardashians\"\nto preview an episode."},"521":{"dur":4,"text":"And she got around\n83,000 clicks on Twitter."},"525":{"dur":0,"text":"Right?"},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"She has 18 million followers."},"528":{"dur":3,"text":"So that conversion is less\nthan a banner ad would be."},"532":{"dur":1,"text":"Banner ads are terrible."},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"Like who hear clicks on\nbanner ads on purpose?"},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"Oftentimes I get mad, because\nI actually click on it,"},"538":{"dur":0,"text":"and I'm go back!"},"539":{"dur":0,"text":"Go back!"},"540":{"dur":4,"text":"So ultimately, the influencers\nare very niche and targeted."},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"And Kim is super broad."},"547":{"dur":4,"text":"So here you can see that she's\naround 0.46 of a percent."},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"Banner ads on average are\naround half of a percent."},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"So you may as well go spend a\nbunch of money on banner ads"},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"if you can spend a bunch of cash\nto get Kim Kardashian to tweet"},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"about your product, or\nyour club opening in Vegas,"},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"or anything relevant\nto her community,"},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"because she has a\nbroad celebrity."},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"She's a mascot."},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"And what's equally\nfascinating about this data"},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"is you notice the decay up here."},"573":{"dur":4,"text":"In the first 48 hours is where\nthe bulk of her traffic comes."},"577":{"dur":1,"text":"So nothing is being recycled."},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"Nothing is being circulated\namongst other influencer"},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"communities to\nkeep this thriving."},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"Unlike the Minecraft\nvideos, which"},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"are more timeless,\nmore evergreen,"},"587":{"dur":3,"text":"and more personality-driven."},"590":{"dur":3,"text":"So all this fascination after I\nleft Machinima and I love what"},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"we were doing-- those big ideas\nwe built the marketing team--"},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"I went on to some other\nstartups and helped them"},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"raise capital and do marketing."},"600":{"dur":5,"text":"But ultimately, I believe that\nthe world is so fascinating"},"606":{"dur":3,"text":"right now, because you can\nmake a dent in doing something"},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"that you can leave\ninfluence around."},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"And then ultimately\nthere's a bartering"},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"and there is an\nexchange of ideas."},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"And we truly have\nnavigated a new economy."},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"So I wrote this book\nto help us learn"},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"how to operate in\nthis new economy,"},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"and helping to teach others--"},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"because learning is\nreally the fundamental"},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"of how we exchange ideas."},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"And oftentimes giving\nvalue is what matters."},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's how we\nnavigate this new world."},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"So Seth Godin."},"636":{"dur":3,"text":"He's a fellow speaker at Google."},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"I interviewed over\n100 influencers"},"641":{"dur":3,"text":"for my podcast, which is called\n\"Stories from the Influencer"},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"Economy,\" because I\nwanted to build up"},"646":{"dur":3,"text":"an idea and a platform\nahead of my book launch."},"650":{"dur":1,"text":"So I talked to Adam

writers."},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"And I took their application."},"658":{"dur":3,"text":"And I applied their old\nknowledge with new influencers"},"662":{"dur":1,"text":"in the social media space."},"664":{"dur":2,"text":"So Seth, why we'll\nbe talking about"},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"him is because\nhe's an influencer."},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"He'll be around in 20 years\nwhen you Google his name."},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"So he talks about\na tribe, and how"},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"a tribe is a group of people\nconnected to one another,"},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"connected to a leader,\nconnected to an idea."},"680":{"dur":1,"text":"For millions of\nyears, human beings"},"682":{"dur":1,"text":"have been part of\none tribe or another."},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"A group needs only two\nthings to be a tribe."},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"A shared interest, and\na way to communicate."},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"Your company at Google\nis led by tribes."},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"Everyone who has different\nteams from research to tech,"},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"you have a tribe leader."},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"And you are interested\nin connecting."},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's ultimately\nwhat happens"},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"with storytelling and sharing of\nideas and why someone like Seth"},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"is an influencer."},"706":{"dur":3,"text":"So these are the chapters of\nthe book, which you all got,"},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"in emoji."},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"I researched his book years ago."},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"I did this slide to\nconnect with millennials,"},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"because my parents\ndidn't use emoji."},"718":{"dur":1,"text":"But now my parents use emoji."},"719":{"dur":1,"text":"So this slide is\nreally for everyone."},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"But ultimately, the emoji\nchapters of the book"},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"are how you craft\nyour big vision."},"727":{"dur":4,"text":"Every influencer I talk to\nhas a big vision, a big idea,"},"731":{"dur":1,"text":"to sell you on something."},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"Like Sergei and Larry years\nago, they had this big vision"},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"to solve a problem."},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"Because you need buy-in from\npeople to believe in what"},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"you're doing."},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"Secondly is you pick a platform."},"742":{"dur":1,"text":"I picked the\nsuitcase emoji here,"},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"because you've got to pick\nsomewhere you're going."},"746":{"dur":1,"text":"And you need a channel."},"747":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's no longer, oh,\nI want to go to coffee"},"749":{"dur":0,"text":"and pick your brain."},"750":{"dur":1,"text":"Those people drive me nuts."},"751":{"dur":0,"text":"I don't know."},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"Sorry if anyone here does that."},"755":{"dur":1,"text":"Sorry, not sorry, actually."},"757":{"dur":2,"text":"Because ultimately, you want\nto collaborate with someone."},"759":{"dur":0,"text":"And you pick a channel."},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"It could be building an alpha\nversion of your product."},"763":{"dur":1,"text":"It could be you make\nYouTube content."},"764":{"dur":1,"text":"For me, it was podcasting."},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"And ultimately, we were\nbuilding these relationships"},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"because that's what is currency\nin the influencer economy."},"772":{"dur":2,"text":"The next thing is a\nbook your own gigs."},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"You have to deal with\nrejection, like Jay-Z. Actually,"},"777":{"dur":1,"text":"this is the only\nemoji that I invented."},"779":{"dur":1,"text":"I thought Jay-Z\nwould need an emoji."},"781":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, who doesn't?"},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"If anyone earned an\nemoji, it's Jay-Z."},"784":{"dur":2,"text":"So you got to deal\nwith rejection."},"786":{"dur":1,"text":"You have to build relationships."},"788":{"dur":1,"text":"And you have to accept failure."},"789":{"dur":1,"text":"And you have to do every job."},"791":{"dur":1,"text":"And I grew up in\nDes Moines, Iowa."},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's known for corn farming."},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"And I like to say,\nnever build in a silo."},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"Never build by yourself."},"799":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, this company was founded\nin a garage in Silicon Valley"},"803":{"dur":1,"text":"and Stanford."},"804":{"dur":2,"text":"But that stereotype is over."},"806":{"dur":1,"text":"People need to\nbuild with others."},"807":{"dur":0,"text":"You have to share."},"808":{"dur":2,"text":"Because you need psychological\nand behavioral buy-in"},"811":{"dur":2,"text":"from people to help make\nyour idea better, and then"},"813":{"dur":1,"text":"moreover help spreading it."},"815":{"dur":3,"text":"The next is adopt\ntechnology early and often."},"819":{"dur":2,"text":"Influencers are always\ncurious around technology."},"821":{"dur":1,"text":"They need to find\ntech as a solution."},"823":{"dur":1,"text":"And they can't be tech phobics."},"824":{"dur":2,"text":"The next one is striving\nfor authenticity."},"827":{"dur":2,"text":"And authenticity is a\nword that's overused."},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"I love the word and\nI hate the word."},"832":{"dur":3,"text":"Who here likes the\nword \"authentic\"?"},"835":{"dur":1,"text":"Who here doesn't like the word?"},"837":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's a very branded

affable,"},"851":{"dur":2,"text":"being likable because\nyou are who you are."},"854":{"dur":2,"text":"And ultimately we have flaws."},"856":{"dur":2,"text":"And we have characteristics\nthat we can't

successful,"},"2507":{"dur":1,"text":"it's really finding\nthat validation."},"2509":{"dur":4,"text":"Like, with my podcast, I've had\nsome fairly well-known people"},"2513":{"dur":4,"text":"that I

you do\ngathering and surveys."},"2621":{"dur":1,"text":"And you build the alpha."},"2623":{"dur":2,"text":"You build that core\ncommunity of people"},"2625":{"dur":2,"text":"that are going to

to make a\nmessage that goes a little bit"},"2632":{"dur":1,"text":"more mainstream in most cases."},"2634":{"dur":1,"text":"But ultimately,\nthat core community"},"2635":{"dur":2,"text":"of people

out"},"2650":{"dur":2,"text":"a way to solve that\nproblem with that community"},"2652":{"dur":2,"text":"like you would building\na product at Google."},"2654":{"dur":3,"text":"And then

you"},"2664":{"dur":2,"text":"want to pass, and have ideas."},"2666":{"dur":2,"text":"And I look at it like if you\nhave 100 people that give you"},"2668":{"dur":2,"text":"advice from a random\nsample

they"},"2677":{"dur":2,"text":"can help you transcend\nthe message to other folks"},"2679":{"dur":1,"text":"to get them on board."},"2681":{"dur":3,"text":"And I look at actually passing\nbills with a

metrics."},"2712":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'll tell you just the truth."},"2716":{"dur":3,"text":"I was approached by a\nfriend who is an author."},"2719":{"dur":3,"text":"And I don't know if I should be\nadmitting this, but he said--"},"2723":{"dur":1,"text":"I self-published."},"2724":{"dur":1,"text":"He said, if you\nwant a publisher,"},"2726":{"dur":2,"text":"then you need 100\nAmazon reviews."},"2728":{"dur":3,"text":"Because that's the one\npercenter of books on Amazon."},"2732":{"dur":2,"text":"So 1% of all books\nhave 100 reviews."},"2734":{"dur":4,"text":"So he says you'll have that\nsocial proof if you actually"},"2738":{"dur":0,"text":"get 100 reviews."},"2739":{"dur":1,"text":"And then I'll introduce\nyou to my agent."},"2740":{"dur":1,"text":"And you know, the\nrest is history."},"2742":{"dur":1,"text":"So the book's going\nto come out next year."},"2744":{"dur":4,"text":"We're translating into\nKorean simultaneously."},"2748":{"dur":2,"text":"And so 100 reviews\nis a huge threshold."},"2751":{"dur":1,"text":"So I would barter with people."},"2753":{"dur":1,"text":"And if you came to my\nbook event this summer"},"2754":{"dur":2,"text":"in Raleigh,

look."},"2762":{"dur":2,"text":"If you leave me\nan Amazon review,"},"2764":{"dur":2,"text":"if you honestly read the\nbook, I will give you"},"2767":{"dur":2,"text":"a free Skype consultation\nwhen I go back to LA."},"2770":{"dur":1,"text":"So I would barter with people."},"2771":{"dur":2,"text":"And they would give me\namazing feedback on the book."},"2774":{"dur":1,"text":"I look at a book like software."},"2775":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'll publish 2.0 next year."},"2777":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'll use that feedback\nas part of the experience,"},"2781":{"dur":2,"text":"because people have told me\nhow I can make it better."},"2783":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I found hooks\nlike that where--"},"2786":{"dur":1,"text":"like, I'm on the board\nof my kids' preschool."},"2787":{"dur":2,"text":"And a bunch of people\nbought the book."},"2790":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's that\nphrase, \"just ask.\""},"2792":{"dur":2,"text":"Like, no one knows that\nAmazon reviews are currency."},"2795":{"dur":2,"text":"They don't know that\nit's a bartering economy,"},"2797":{"dur":2,"text":"and that that matters to\npeople like me that are really"},"2799":{"dur":1,"text":"getting the word out there."},"2800":{"dur":1,"text":"And the fact that\nit was noticeable--"},"2802":{"dur":2,"text":"a Korean publisher-- I\nhad four people from Korea"},"2804":{"dur":1,"text":"reach out to me in three weeks."},"2806":{"dur":1,"text":"And I imagine those\nreviews really matter,"},"2807":{"dur":3,"text":"because you can get social proof\nfrom the community, not just"},"2811":{"dur":1,"text":"influencers."},"2812":{"dur":2,"text":"If you have a million\nYouTube subscribers"},"2814":{"dur":1,"text":"and a bunch of Amazon reviews."},"2816":{"dur":1,"text":"So I really bartered\nwith people,"},"2817":{"dur":2,"text":"because no one understood\nreally from my friends,"},"2820":{"dur":1,"text":"the people that would see it."},"2821":{"dur":2,"text":"So anyone listening now, please,\nif you leave an Amazon review,"},"2824":{"dur":1,"text":"honestly, that would be amazing."},"2826":{"dur":2,"text":"And email me and tell me what\nyou think about the book,"},"2828":{"dur":2,"text":"because you have to open\nyourself up to criticism."},"2830":{"dur":2,"text":"And the reviews\nactually are solid,"},"2833":{"dur":2,"text":"because it was the\nright
