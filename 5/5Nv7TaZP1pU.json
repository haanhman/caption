He said, you know, no one has"},"834":{"dur":4,"text":"really taken on the full story. So, with no\nqualifications at all, except for eating a"},"838":{"dur":6,"text":"lot of soul food and cooking it some, I wrote\nthe book on the history of soul food. And"},"845":{"dur":3,"text":"it was really during that research that I\nstarted to learn about the African\u2011Americans"},"849":{"dur":4,"text":"who cooked for our presidents.

And that really"},"937":{"dur":5,"text":"rounded out the research. Let's talk about\nthe White House domestic staff and what it"},"943":{"dur":5,"text":"was like for African\u2011Americans in the presidential\nkitchen.

All right. Here is the first person"},"1041":{"dur":3,"text":"I will talk about. A man named Samuel Fraunces.\nI know what you are thinking as soon as this"},"1045":{"dur":5,"text":"picture came up, he looks a lot like a white\ndude. Well, his race has been contested by"},"1050":{"dur":5,"text":"a lot of historians.

He is the first chapter of my boo\u00a0\u2011\u2011"},"1067":{"dur":4,"text":"or second chapter. The first chapter of the\nbook I show the different elements that go"},"1071":{"dur":6,"text":"into presidential food ways and food culture.\nI take a Maison plat approach. There are two"},"1078":{"dur":4,"text":"kinds of cooks. You probably know cooks that\nwalk into any kitchen, look into the pantry"},"1082":{"dur":4,"text":"or the fridge and they can just create a great\nmeal. That's not me. I need to have everything"},"1086":{"dur":4,"text":"measured out ahead of time and all of my ingredients.\nIf you go to culinary school, that's called"},"1091":{"dur":3,"text":"Maison plat. So I take that approach when\ntalking about presidential food ways. But"},"1095":{"dur":4,"text":"the second chapter, I talk about all the people\nwho are in charge of running the domestic"},"1099":{"dur":5,"text":"operations for the presidential residence.\nIn the earliest days of the presidency they"},"1104":{"dur":6,"text":"were called stewards. Today they are called\nthe chief usher. The first steward in the"},"1111":{"dur":4,"text":"United\u00a0States history is this man, Samuel\nFraunces. He comes from the West Indies, arrives"},"1116":{"dur":6,"text":"in New\u00a0York City in the 1750s. He was a very\nastute businessman, and started running a"},"1123":{"dur":4,"text":"pickling and preserving business. Then he\nopens up a tavern called Fraunces Tavern."},"1128":{"dur":5,"text":"If you go to New\u00a0York City you will actually\nsee a replica of that tavern on 54 Pearl Street"},"1133":{"dur":6,"text":"in Lower Manhattan not too far from Wall\u00a0Street.\nSo he runs this tavern and has a very famous"},"1140":{"dur":6,"text":"patron, General George Washington, who frequently\nate at his tavern and loved his food. When"},"1147":{"dur":5,"text":"Washington becomes president, he actually\ntaps Fraunces to run his household and be"},"1152":{"dur":5,"text":"the first presidential steward.

The first thing I wanted to share\nwith you is called the poison pea plot of"},"1168":{"dur":7,"text":"1776. Now I don't know if you learned about\nthis in grade school or even in college, but"},"1175":{"dur":5,"text":"this is actually a mint green pea soup that\nis served at the George W.

So, George Washington loved\ngreen peas, in fact so much his contemporaries"},"1193":{"dur":4,"text":"called him pea ditty. Okay, I just had to\ntry it, I had to go for it."},"1198":{"dur":2,"text":"(LAUGHTER)\n>> Adrian Miller: Here is the story. The story"},"1200":{"dur":6,"text":"is, Fraunces daughter, a woman named Phoebe\nis preparing a meal for the general, and it"},"1206":{"dur":5,"text":"includes his favorite green peas. There was\na guy named Thomas Hickey who was kind of"},"1211":{"dur":5,"text":"hanging around the kitchen. He was not sympathetic\nto all this revolutionary talk. And he was"},"1216":{"dur":5,"text":"trying to figure out a way to basically poison\nthe general. So, he is in the kitchen, he"},"1221":{"dur":5,"text":"distracts Phoebe and puts extra seasoning\non the peas, and they get sent out to the"},"1227":{"dur":5,"text":"table. Phoebe senses something is going on,\nshe tells her father Samuel Fraunces, and"},"1232":{"dur":5,"text":"Fraunces immediately understands what is happening.\nHe bursts from the kitchen, and just as the"},"1237":{"dur":4,"text":"general is about to eat the peas, he grabs\nthe plate and the fork and throws the peas"},"1242":{"dur":5,"text":"out the window. Now at that very same moment\nthere was a chicken walking by who pecked"},"1248":{"dur":7,"text":"at the peas and dies. So thanks to that animal\ntesting they know the peas were poisoned."},"1255":{"dur":6,"text":"It's a fabulous story but probably not true\nfor a lot of reasons. One, there was\u00a0\u2011\u2011"},"1261":{"dur":2,"text":"Fraunces did have daughters but we don't have\na record of someone named Phoebe. It could"},"1264":{"dur":5,"text":"have been a family nickname. And two, there\nwas a guy Thomas Hickey, and he was charged"},"1270":{"dur":5,"text":"with treason but his crime was really for\ncounterfeiting not for an assassination attempt."},"1275":{"dur":7,"text":"He was actually hanged in the New\u00a0York Harbor\nin July of 1776 and about 20,000 people showed"},"1282":{"dur":5,"text":"up for the execution. But his crime was counterfeiting\nand creating passes that may have allowed"},"1288":{"dur":5,"text":"other unsavory people to be in the general's\npresence and kill him. So it's a great story,"},"1293":{"dur":3,"text":"probably not true, but if it is true, ladies\nand gentlemen, I submit to you this is the"},"1297":{"dur":6,"text":"first act of culinary Homeland Security in\nour great nation. Here is another cook, this"},"1303":{"dur":6,"text":"is Hercules. Now Hercules was the enslaved\ncook for George\u00a0\u2011\u2011 President George Washington."},"1309":{"dur":5,"text":"And my second chapter talks about the various\nenslaved cooks that have worked in the White"},"1315":{"dur":5,"text":"House.

It is believed\nto be painted by Gilbert Stewart, the same"},"1337":{"dur":4,"text":"artist who painted that iconic portrait of\nGeorge Washington that so many of us know."},"1341":{"dur":6,"text":"Hercules gets basically purchased by George\nWashington when he was a teenager. He was"},"1347":{"dur":4,"text":"a ferryman at the time, but for whatever reason\nGeorge Washington moves him to the kitchen"},"1351":{"dur":5,"text":"in Mount Vernon and has him train under another\nenslaved chef, Old Doll. So he cooks for her"},"1357":{"dur":6,"text":"for years. When the president moves from New\u00a0York\nto Philadelphia he actually brings Hercules"},"1364":{"dur":4,"text":"to Philadelphia and installs him as his cook.\nThe reason why he did this, is that his first"},"1369":{"dur":3,"text":"cook, a white woman named Mrs.\u00a0Reed, I guess\nthe food was nasty. He just was not feeling"},"1373":{"dur":4,"text":"it. So he fires Mrs. Reed and asks Hercules\nto come up and be his cook. There was one"},"1378":{"dur":5,"text":"slight problem. Pennsylvania at that time\nhad something called the Gradual Abolition"},"1383":{"dur":5,"text":"Act of 1780, which meant if you were enslaved\nperson and you were on Pennsylvania soil for"},"1389":{"dur":4,"text":"six months or longer, you were automatically\nfree. So the way that George Washington got"},"1394":{"dur":4,"text":"around this, right about the time of the six\u2011month\ndeadline, he would pack up all of the enslaved"},"1398":{"dur":4,"text":"people, leave them at Mount Vernon, leave\nthem there a few weeks\u00a0\u2011\u2011 I know, messed"},"1403":{"dur":5,"text":"up, right? He would bring them back and he\ndid this throughout his presidency. While"},"1409":{"dur":5,"text":"in Philadelphia Hercules was given a lot of\nliberties. He was allowed to go to the circus."},"1414":{"dur":5,"text":"After work he would get dressed up in a fancy\nsuit and walk around town with a golden cane."},"1420":{"dur":4,"text":"Also George Washington let him sell leftovers\nout of the kitchen. And he made a couple thousand"},"1424":{"dur":5,"text":"dollars a year, back then, selling his leftovers,\nthat was how good the brother's cooking was."},"1430":{"dur":6,"text":"At the end of President Washington's second\nterm, he suspected Hercules is going to escape."},"1436":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, to punish him, he sends him back to\nMount Vernon, but not to the kitchen. He puts"},"1441":{"dur":7,"text":"him in the fields having him make bricks and\nother hard labor. So this well renown chef"},"1449":{"dur":4,"text":"is now in the field doing hard labor. So on\nWashington's 65th birthday, he actually runs"},"1453":{"dur":4,"text":"away successfully. And Washington was not\nhappy about it. If you read accounts from"},"1458":{"dur":4,"text":"Washington he could have a volcanic temper.\nHe was upset. You can tell through the letters"},"1463":{"dur":3,"text":"that he wrote to his associates that he was\ngoing through the five stages of grief at"},"1466":{"dur":5,"text":"this time. He spared no expense to get Hercules\nbut never finds him. The question is, where"},"1472":{"dur":7,"text":"does Hercules go? Going back to this outfit.\nThis is the outfit of somebody who would have"},"1480":{"dur":5,"text":"been a chef in Europe at that time period,\nnot in the United\u00a0States. So it's believed"},"1485":{"dur":4,"text":"he may have gone to Europe to sit for the\npainting, but we are all speculating, no one"},"1489":{"dur":7,"text":"really knows. The last we hear of Hercules\nis after Washington dies, he is was spotted"},"1496":{"dur":6,"text":"in New\u00a0York City by the mayor of New\u00a0York\nCity, Mayor Barrack, who was actually a personal"},"1502":{"dur":6,"text":"secretary of President Washington at one point.\nHe writes to Martha Washington asking if she"},"1509":{"dur":5,"text":"wants him to make an effort to actually recapture\nHercules and brings him back, but Martha never"},"1514":{"dur":4,"text":"responds.

She actually has to get talked"},"1785":{"dur":4,"text":"into the job.

It"},"1853":{"dur":4,"text":"never got to litigation, but I just thought\nthat was pretty fascinating. Dollie Johnson"},"1858":{"dur":4,"text":"was celebrated in her time. She was known\nfor her cooking. She got the Harrisons hooked"},"1862":{"dur":5,"text":"on southern food classics. And then the interesting\nthing about her is\u00a0\u2011\u2011 well, a couple"},"1868":{"dur":4,"text":"of things. First of all, there is tragedy\nin her family.

I knew that they\nhad a predominantly African\u2011American staff."},"2009":{"dur":9,"text":"It was because of woman named Henrietta Nesbit.\nIs anybody related? Okay. Nope? Okay. So she"},"2018":{"dur":5,"text":"would stand behind the cooks and adjust their\nseasonings, and she didn't know how to cook."},"2024":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's why the food was horrible.

Some speculate that this\nmay have been a way to get back at FDR for"},"2038":{"dur":6,"text":"a lot of things. But, moving on, he spent\ntime in Warm Springs, Georgia at something"},"2044":{"dur":4,"text":"they called the \"Little White House.\" And\nsome family loaned their African\u2011American"},"2049":{"dur":3,"text":"cook to Roosevelt while he was there, and\nshe got him hooked on a lot of things. I want"},"2052":{"dur":5,"text":"to tell you first about this cheese souffle.\nNow I was\u00a0talking to AOTUS about souffle,"},"2058":{"dur":7,"text":"so I am going to ask you, what is the biggest\nconcern about making a souffle? Having it"},"2065":{"dur":4,"text":"fall. Right? Ladies and gentlemen, I am going\nto tell you a story, that's a miracle. It's"},"2069":{"dur":7,"text":"going to rattle your soul and also your belly.\nHere is goes: On April 12, 1945, Daisy Bonner"},"2077":{"dur":5,"text":"had a cheese souffle, timed to come out at\n1:15 for FDR. He was there in Warm Springs,"},"2083":{"dur":5,"text":"sitting for a portrait. And as you know, he\nhad a fatal cerebral hemorrhage at 1:12. So"},"2088":{"dur":7,"text":"this souffle never got served. According to\nDaisy Bonner, that souffle did not fall two"},"2096":{"dur":7,"text":"hours until FDR was officially pronounced\ndead. That's the story. All right? A miracle."},"2103":{"dur":4,"text":"I have the souffle recipe in my book, I have\nto stay it does fall. It didn't stay up two"},"2108":{"dur":5,"text":"hours for me. But it's a good recipe. The\ninteresting thing, Daisy Bonner is the one"},"2113":{"dur":4,"text":"who calls the White House switchboard to let\nthem know about what happened to FDR, and"},"2118":{"dur":6,"text":"she was so moved by FDR's death that she actually\nwrote on the wall in the kitchen of\u00a0\u2011\u2011"},"2124":{"dur":4,"text":"the cottage's kitchen, \"Daisy Bonner cooked\nfirst and last meal for President Roosevelt.\""},"2129":{"dur":4,"text":"And that is encased in plastic. If you go\nthere, you can see the exact spot where she"},"2133":{"dur":8,"text":"wrote this on the wall. The other thing that\nwas interesting, she got FDR hooked on pig's"},"2141":{"dur":6,"text":"feet. FDR actually served pigs feet to Winston\nChurchill in the White House. We know this"},"2148":{"dur":6,"text":"because Alonzo Fields, a long time butler\nand maitre d' at the White House saw them"},"2154":{"dur":4,"text":"eating these pigs feet. So it was a sweet\nand sour pigs feet from the recipe from the"},"2158":{"dur":6,"text":"princess of Norway. So FDR and Winston Churchill\nare eating these pigs feet, and FDR who is"},"2165":{"dur":4,"text":"eating them with gusto, asks Churchill, how\ndo you like them? Churchill says, well, they"},"2170":{"dur":4,"text":"have an interesting texture. That's all he\ncould say to compliment them.

So, now I want to tell you about John\nMoaney who was President Eisenhower's valet"},"2213":{"dur":6,"text":"in World War II, during World War II. They\nbecame really good friends. Eisenhower calls"},"2220":{"dur":6,"text":"him indispensable. He comes to basically serve\nthe president, be a valet, but he helps out"},"2226":{"dur":4,"text":"with cooking duties. Eisenhower was probably\nthe President who loved to cook the most."},"2230":{"dur":5,"text":"In fact, he would go up to the rooftop of\nthe White House and grill steaks.

But he"},"2243":{"dur":7,"text":"was also known for making a very beef\u2011laden\nvegetable stew. Now, this stew was very famous"},"2251":{"dur":6,"text":"because the White House released the recipe.\nAnd actually during 1956 election, they encouraged"},"2257":{"dur":6,"text":"housewives to have stew suppers around the\ncountry. The idea was to make this stew and"},"2264":{"dur":4,"text":"invite your neighbors over to hear more about\nEisenhower. But inside the White House it"},"2268":{"dur":10,"text":"was called Moaney's stew. This woman is Zephyr\nWright, the long\u2011time cook for President"},"2279":{"dur":5,"text":"Johnson. Lyndon Johnson. And of all of the\npeople I discovered in my book, she is the"},"2284":{"dur":6,"text":"one I really wanted to meet.

And the family\nbrings her to Washington when they get to"},"2298":{"dur":6,"text":"Washington.

It got so bad that she\nultimately refused to go with the family on"},"2318":{"dur":5,"text":"these drives. So she just stayed in Washington,\nDC year round. So fast forward when Johnson"},"2323":{"dur":7,"text":"becomes president. He actually uses her anecdotes\nto lobby for the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

The"},"2346":{"dur":6,"text":"other task she had was just keeping LBJ in\nline. So you have probably seen stories about"},"2352":{"dur":5,"text":"how forceful LBJ could be. Well, there were\ntwo things he would do to really annoy the"},"2357":{"dur":4,"text":"staff. He often would show up late and demand\na meal.

Zephyr just gave"},"2367":{"dur":4,"text":"it right back to him. One time he showed up\nat the White House and demanded a meal and"},"2371":{"dur":3,"text":"she said, you just go sit down in the kitchen\nand you wait until I make something. And he"},"2374":{"dur":5,"text":"would do it. I just thought that was amazing.\nAnd he would show up with unexpected guests,"},"2379":{"dur":6,"text":"her strategy was to just start sending out\na lot of liquor. Once the guests were liquored"},"2386":{"dur":4,"text":"up, it didn't really matter how long it took\nto cook the food. So I just thought she was"},"2390":{"dur":6,"text":"an ingenious person, and a very forceful personality.\nNow, she did actually get the White House"},"2396":{"dur":6,"text":"in hot water one time. It was related to a\nrecipe that was released by the White House."},"2403":{"dur":6,"text":"Do I have any Texans in the audience? Anyone\nwho will admit it? Okay.
