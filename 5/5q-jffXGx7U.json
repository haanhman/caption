intention"},"150":{"dur":5,"text":"is really to help anchor us in\nwhat mindfulness actually is."},"156":{"dur":2,"text":"And I want to take just\na moment to acknowledge"},"158":{"dur":3,"text":"some of my teachers, first\nof all, my co-author,"},"162":{"dur":0,"text":"Dr. Christopher White."},"163":{"dur":1,"text":"He's a pediatrician."},"165":{"dur":3,"text":"Jack Kornfield, Roger\nWalsh,

welcome."},"175":{"dur":2,"text":"I like to really\nacknowledge them,"},"178":{"dur":1,"text":"because even though\na lot of my training"},"179":{"dur":3,"text":"was in Thailand and Nepal\nin Buddhist

practice."},"208":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a universal way of being."},"210":{"dur":4,"text":"And it transcends\nreligion and culture."},"215":{"dur":3,"text":"So, again, my\nintention is really"},"219":{"dur":3,"text":"just for us to understand\nmindfulness first and foremost."},"222":{"dur":3,"text":"Second, I want to briefly\nreview the research"},"226":{"dur":2,"text":"and talk a bit about\nis mindfulness helpful?"},"228":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that helps\nmotivate people,"},"229":{"dur":2,"text":"when they know the\nscience behind it."},"232":{"dur":1,"text":"And then talk a\nlittle bit about how"},"233":{"dur":2,"text":"do we integrate\nit into parenting?"},"236":{"dur":2,"text":"And ending with what I\nthink is most important,"},"238":{"dur":1,"text":"which is self-compassion."},"240":{"dur":2,"text":"I think if you learn\nnothing else today except"},"242":{"dur":2,"text":"to be a little bit gentler\nand a little kinder"},"244":{"dur":2,"text":"to yourself as a\nparent-- in fact,"},"246":{"dur":2,"text":"how many people feel like\nthey're not quite doing it"},"248":{"dur":1,"text":"right as a parent?"},"250":{"dur":2,"text":"Haven't quite figured it out?"},"253":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm right there with you."},"255":{"dur":4,"text":"It's actually this pervasive\nsense of I'm a terrible parent."},"259":{"dur":1,"text":"Like, everyone else\nkind of has it together."},"261":{"dur":0,"text":"They're getting it."},"262":{"dur":1,"text":"But I can't do it."},"263":{"dur":2,"text":"And yet everyone feels that way."},"265":{"dur":1,"text":"So I think this piece\nof self-compassion"},"267":{"dur":2,"text":"is really important."},"269":{"dur":0,"text":"All right."},"270":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is our book."},"272":{"dur":1,"text":"This wonderful quote we\nhave, by Andrew Weil."},"274":{"dur":1,"text":"He says, \"One of the\nmost exceptional road"},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"maps on how to raise happy,\nresilient, and emotionally"},"277":{"dur":1,"text":"healthy children.\""},"279":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's really\nthe intention, is"},"281":{"dur":2,"text":"how do we raise children\nthat are happy and healthy?"},"284":{"dur":1,"text":"That's what we most\nwant for our children."},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"Not that they're rich and\nsuccessful and famous,"},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"but happy, healthy, resilient."},"290":{"dur":2,"text":"And then emotionally\nintelligent."},"293":{"dur":2,"text":"Really not just using\ntheir intellect,"},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"but using their heart,\ntheir body, their sensation,"},"297":{"dur":2,"text":"their emotions, for how\nto navigate life and live"},"300":{"dur":2,"text":"in the most beautiful way."},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"So the foundation\nof mindful parenting"},"305":{"dur":5,"text":"is awareness and compassion\nof ourselves and others."},"311":{"dur":3,"text":"Your own awareness, your own\ncompassion, your own presence,"},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"is essential."},"317":{"dur":1,"text":"This is from Gordon\nNeufeld, who's"},"319":{"dur":2,"text":"been really influential in my\nunderstanding of parenting."},"321":{"dur":5,"text":"He says, \"Parenthood is above\nall a relationship, not a skill"},"326":{"dur":1,"text":"to be acquired."},"328":{"dur":3,"text":"Attachment is not a behavior\nto be learned, but a connection"},"331":{"dur":1,"text":"to be sought.\""},"333":{"dur":0,"text":"OK?"},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"So we want someone to come in\nand say, well just do A, B,"},"336":{"dur":1,"text":"and C, and it's all\ngoing to be good."},"338":{"dur":0,"text":"Right?"},"339":{"dur":3,"text":"But actually, parenting requires\nconnection and relationship."},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"And this requires presence."},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"Thich Nhat Hanh says,\n\"The most precious gift"},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"we can offer others\nis our presence."},"350":{"dur":2,"text":"When mindfulness\nembraces those we love,"},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"they bloom like flowers.\""},"355":{"dur":1,"text":"OK?"},"356":{"dur":3,"text":"So mindfulness is presence."},"359":{"dur":1,"text":"That's what it is."},"360":{"dur":4,"text":"Mindfulness is about being\nfully here, fully present."},"365":{"dur":5,"text":"And what that requires is that\nwe begin to see things clearly."},"371":{"dur":3,"text":"So the word \"mindfulness\"\nactually means to see clearly."},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"To see clearly what's\nhappening in this moment."},"377":{"dur":3,"text":"To see clearly what your child\nis needing in a given moment."},"381":{"dur":3,"text":"To see clearly, we\nneed to do something."},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"What do we need to do to\nbe able to see clearly?"},"389":{"dur":1,"text":"We have to be able\nto pay attention."},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"So I've been talking now\nfor maybe four minutes."},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm curious-- how many people\nhave noticed that your mind has"},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"wandered off in these\nlast four minutes?"},"399":{"dur":0,"text":"Come on."},"400":{"dur":1,"text":"In fact, don't even\nraise your hand."},"401":{"dur":0,"text":"I know."},"402":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll bring you into my\nlaboratory and I'll look"},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"at your brain if you\ntell me you didn't."},"406":{"dur":1,"text":"Your mind has wandered\nin the last four"},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"minutes many, many times."},"410":{"dur":3,"text":"What we've found is that the\nmind wanders approximately 50%"},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"of the time."},"415":{"dur":1,"text":"That's a lot."},"416":{"dur":1,"text":"So let's say you live to be 100."},"417":{"dur":2,"text":"That's 50 years of your\nlife that are spaced out."},"420":{"dur":1,"text":"That's not even\ncounting sleeping time."},"422":{"dur":0,"text":"Right?"},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"So part of mindfulness, part\nof the way that we learn"},"426":{"dur":4,"text":"how to see things clearly, is\nby gathering our attention here"},"430":{"dur":1,"text":"in the present moment."},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"So just try it with me for,\nlike, the next two minutes."},"434":{"dur":1,"text":"See if you can actually be here."},"436":{"dur":2,"text":"Because all of your bodies\nare here right now, right?"},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"No one's left."},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you."},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"See if you can have your\nmind be where your body is,"},"443":{"dur":1,"text":"instead of just leaving\nthis empty shell that's"},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"kind of like spaced out and\nglazed over for me to look at."},"448":{"dur":0,"text":"Right?"},"449":{"dur":0,"text":"You're doing great."},"450":{"dur":0,"text":"A minute and a half left."},"451":{"dur":1,"text":"You're all right here with me."},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"And you are definitely here."},"454":{"dur":1,"text":"Welcome."},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"But mindfulness is not\njust about attention."},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"Because otherwise a sniper\ncould be the most mindful person"},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"They have amazing\nattentional skills."},"463":{"dur":3,"text":"So mindfulness is also about\nwhy we're paying attention."},"466":{"dur":1,"text":"What is my intention?"},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"Right?"},"469":{"dur":0,"text":"What is my vision?"},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"What is my goal?"},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"What is the kind of motivation?"},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"So why are you paying attention?"},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"And then how you pay attention."},"478":{"dur":1,"text":"So how is your attitude?"},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the quality\nof your attention."},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"You have 30 seconds left."},"483":{"dur":1,"text":"Are you still here with me?"},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"It's kind of hard,\nhuh, to pay attention?"},"488":{"dur":0,"text":"OK?"},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"So also looking at how\nam I paying attention?"},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"Am I judging myself because\nI just wandered off again?"},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"Or am I being curious and\nkind, and saying, oh, whoops!"},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"She said my mind was going\nto wander 50% of the time."},"500":{"dur":0,"text":"Wow."},"501":{"dur":1,"text":"Interesting."},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's our attitude."},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"And, actually, mindfulness\nis about all three"},"508":{"dur":5,"text":"of these elements-- intention,\nattention, and attitude."},"513":{"dur":0,"text":"OK?"},"514":{"dur":1,"text":"Does that make sense?"},"515":{"dur":2,"text":"So I want to talk\nabout each of these."},"518":{"dur":3,"text":"As I said, intention\nis really knowing"},"521":{"dur":1,"text":"why we're doing\nwhat we're doing."},"523":{"dur":1,"text":"Why am I paying attention?"},"525":{"dur":1,"text":"What is my vision?"},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"What is my goal?"},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"Intention sets the\ncompass of your heart."},"531":{"dur":4,"text":"It says, I want to\ngo in this direction."},"535":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not a destination."},"537":{"dur":1,"text":"You're not trying\nto get anywhere."},"538":{"dur":1,"text":"You're just kind of\nguiding yourself."},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the general\ndirection I want to head."},"543":{"dur":1,"text":"So you don't end up\nstriving, and getting"},"544":{"dur":1,"text":"really goal-orientated\nand really fixated"},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"on where you're going."},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"You're actually present\nfor the process."},"550":{"dur":3,"text":"And you're aligning yourself\nwith what's most important."},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"Jon Kabat-Zinn, who's\none of my main teachers,"},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"he says, \"Your intentions set\nthe stage for what is possible."},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"They remind you moment to moment\nof why you're practicing.\""},"563":{"dur":1,"text":"He said, \"I used\nto think meditation"},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"was so powerful that as\nlong as you did it at all,"},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"you'd see growth and change."},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"But time has taught me some\nkind of personal vision"},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"is necessary.\""},"573":{"dur":0,"text":"I love that."},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"First of all, he's so humble."},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"He says, oh, I used to think\nyou could just sit people down,"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"have them meditate, and\neverything would work out."},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"But now I realize,\nsome kind of intention."},"582":{"dur":3,"text":"So when I work with my patients,\nwe always begin with intention."},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"Why are you here?"},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"My favorite quote, by\nSuzuki Roshi, he says,"},"590":{"dur":1,"text":"\"The most important\nthing is to remember"},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"the most important thing.\""},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"That's it."},"595":{"dur":4,"text":"You just have to remember\nwhat is most important to you."},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's not so easy."},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"We forget."},"603":{"dur":1,"text":"This is a picture of my son."},"605":{"dur":1,"text":"This is Jackson."},"606":{"dur":1,"text":"He's nine years old,\nso he doesn't really"},"608":{"dur":1,"text":"look like that anymore."},"609":{"dur":1,"text":"But I love this photo."},"611":{"dur":5,"text":"And recently, I had this\nexperience where he really"},"617":{"dur":4,"text":"reminded me of how easy it\nis to forget our intention."},"621":{"dur":3,"text":"How easy it is to forget\nwhat's most important."},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"So I was teaching\nin Europe, and I'd"},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"been gone for two weeks, which\nwas the longest I've ever"},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"been apart from him."},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"And as I was flying home, I was\njust kind of filled with guilt."},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"And, like, how's it going\nto be when we reconnect?"},"635":{"dur":2,"text":"And have I ruined\nour attachment bond?"},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"And what kind of mother am I?"},"640":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I realized that\nguilt wasn't really going"},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"to help me reconnect with him."},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I set an intention."},"645":{"dur":3,"text":"When I get home, the first\nday, all I'm going to do"},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"is be with Jackson."},"650":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not going to check my email."},"651":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not going to\ngo through my mail."},"652":{"dur":1,"text":"I just want to be with him."},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"It was a beautiful day in Marin."},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"And I decided we'd\ngo to the beach."},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm packing up picnic\nand making it all perfect,"},"660":{"dur":1,"text":"because I'm going to\nbe the perfect mom,"},"662":{"dur":1,"text":"and show him how\nmuch I love him."},"664":{"dur":1,"text":"And I get all his\nstuff together."},"666":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'm like, OK, Jackson."},"667":{"dur":1,"text":"You want to go to the beach?"},"668":{"dur":1,"text":"And he was like, nah."},"670":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't really want to go."},"671":{"dur":0,"text":"I was like, come on."},"672":{"dur":0,"text":"It's going to be so fun."},"673":{"dur":1,"text":"I have everything packed up."},"674":{"dur":0,"text":"Let's go."},"675":{"dur":0,"text":"He was like, OK."},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"And he kind of like is\nshuffling out the door."},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'm 10 feet ahead of\nhim, like already at the car,"},"681":{"dur":1,"text":"ready to have the\nbest day ever so he"},"682":{"dur":1,"text":"knows how much I love him."},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"And I get to the\ncar, and I look back."},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"And he's sitting on the\nground on our front porch."},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'm like, Jackson."},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"And I feel a little\nbit of impatience."},"695":{"dur":3,"text":"And that kind of familiar\ncontraction in my body."},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"And, luckily, I'd been\nteaching mindfulness every day"},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"for the past two weeks,\nso I had some awareness."},"704":{"dur":3,"text":"And there was a moment where--\nit was this choice point."},"707":{"dur":0,"text":"And I could see it."},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"I could get impatient\nand say, hurry up."},"710":{"dur":0,"text":"Let's go to the beach."},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"This is our plan."},"713":{"dur":1,"text":"And then I remembered\nmy intention."},"715":{"dur":0,"text":"Right?"},"716":{"dur":1,"text":"What was the most\nimportant thing?"},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"I just wanted him to know I\nwas home, and he was safe,"},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"and I love him."},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I walked over to him."},"724":{"dur":1,"text":"He was actually\nlooking at these ants"},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"on the ground, which\nwere kind of interesting."},"729":{"dur":1,"text":"And I sat down next to him."},"731":{"dur":1,"text":"And we're sitting there."},"732":{"dur":3,"text":"And all of a sudden he leaned\nhis little body into mine."},"736":{"dur":3,"text":"And I could just feel his\nshoulder and his weight resting"},"739":{"dur":3,"text":"in to me, and the\nsun on our backs."},"743":{"dur":3,"text":"That was the most\nimportant thing, right?"},"746":{"dur":1,"text":"And yet we forget."},"748":{"dur":1,"text":"We forget in an instant."},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"And so mindfulness is about\nremembering our intention."},"754":{"dur":1,"text":"What is most important?"},"755":{"dur":0,"text":"OK?"},"756":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's the first element."},"757":{"dur":0,"text":"Intention."},"760":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'd like you to just let\nyour eyes close for a moment,"},"763":{"dur":5,"text":"and see if you can feel\ninto why you're here."},"769":{"dur":0,"text":"What's your intention?"},"773":{"dur":1,"text":"And don't really think about it."},"774":{"dur":1,"text":"See if you can actually\nfeel in your body."},"776":{"dur":1,"text":"Like maybe feel the\nlove for your child."},"782":{"dur":3,"text":"This feeling into what is\nmost important for you."},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"And then you can\nlet your eyes open."},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"And see if you can keep\nthat alive in your body"},"798":{"dur":2,"text":"as we continue."},"800":{"dur":1,"text":"OK."},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"The second element of\nmindfulness, as I mentioned,"},"804":{"dur":1,"text":"is attention."},"806":{"dur":3,"text":"This is simply paying attention\nin the present moment."},"809":{"dur":3,"text":"And as you've noticed, it's\nkind of challenging, right?"},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's a picture\nof this adorable monkey"},"815":{"dur":4,"text":"up here, because our mind has\nbeen compared to a monkey mind."},"820":{"dur":1,"text":"That our mind\nswings from thought"},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"to thought like a monkey\nswings from limb to limb."},"824":{"dur":0,"text":"Watch."},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"Watch your mind."},"827":{"dur":1,"text":"Tell me if this isn't true."},"829":{"dur":3,"text":"Can you imagine if I put a\nbig

are--\nyou're not in charge."},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"You would not be thinking\nthose thoughts right now."},"842":{"dur":2,"text":"That's not where you would\nwant your attention to

wants to go."},"858":{"dur":3,"text":"And so part of this\npractice is learning"},"861":{"dur":3,"text":"how to train the mind\nin the present moment."},"864":{"dur":3,"text":"How to gather your\nattention back."},"867":{"dur":2,"text":"And we do this in a\nvery gentle, kind way."},"870":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's almost as if the\nmind is like a puppy dog."},"873":{"dur":1,"text":"And it wanders off."},"874":{"dur":1,"text":"And you're like, stay."},"875":{"dur":0,"text":"Come back."},"876":{"dur":1,"text":"It wanders off again."},"878":{"dur":2,"text":"You say, come

that."},"890":{"dur":1,"text":"Actually, don't think about it."},"891":{"dur":1,"text":"Just experience that."},"893":{"dur":0,"text":"Right?"},"894":{"dur":2,"text":"So part of this\npractice is
