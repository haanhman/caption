reason"},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"\"that they are men and women themselves.\""},"373":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think, of course,\nthat's true of all of us."},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"And when we read a book, that's\nwhat we're interested in."},"378":{"dur":2,"text":"What kind of human being is\nthis that we're reading about?"},"381":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, I can say that the rationale"},"383":{"dur":3,"text":"is that by delving into\nwho Louis Kahn was,"},"387":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm drawing you into the\nsense of what his artwork was,"},"390":{"dur":4,"text":"and then bringing a wider\ngroup to his architecture,"},"394":{"dur":1,"text":"and that is true."},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"But, it is also just\ninteresting to find out"},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"what a human

useful"},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"in talking about him as an architect."},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"The three particular\nmoments I'm picking out"},"424":{"dur":3,"text":"are, first, one that happened in 1945."},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"His brother, Oscar Kahn,\nwrote him a letter."},"430":{"dur":1,"text":"And I knew about this letter,"},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"because Nathaniel Kahn told me about it."},"434":{"dur":1,"text":"When you're writing a biography,"},"435":{"dur":3,"text":"you depend, very much, on\nthe kindness of other people"},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"to illuminate what's going on"},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"and give you their leads that they found,"},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"and Nathaniel had found this letter,"},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"which he miraculously had\nnot used in his movie."},"447":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, I was free to discover it myself."},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a four-page, handwritten letter,"},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"by Lou's younger brother, Oscar Kahn."},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"They grew up together."},"456":{"dur":3,"text":"They were only three years apart."},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"They shared the same room"},"461":{"dur":3,"text":"in their entire, poverty-stricken\nPhiladelphia childhood."},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, their paths began to diverge,"},"466":{"dur":1,"text":"when they were in their 20s."},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"And by this time, Oscar was\nliving out in California,"},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"where the rest of the family had moved."},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"And Louis Kahn had stayed in Philadelphia."},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"He was, by then, married\nto Esther, his wife,"},"479":{"dur":3,"text":"and he was living in her\nparents' house with her,"},"483":{"dur":1,"text":"where he continued to live for 30 years"},"485":{"dur":1,"text":"after they were married."},"486":{"dur":3,"text":"And Oscar was writing him, in 1945,"},"489":{"dur":3,"text":"not having seen his\nbrother in about 15 years,"},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"and saying, \"What happened to you?"},"495":{"dur":0,"text":"\"Where have you gone?\""},"496":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, \"We don't see you anymore.\""},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's four handwritten pages."},"500":{"dur":1,"text":"And the first page-and-a-half"},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"are reminisces of their\nchildhood, and so forth."},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, he kind of catches\nhimself, and he says,"},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Actually, that wasn't what\nI meant to write about."},"508":{"dur":3,"text":"\"I meant to write about\nyour curious disappearance.\""},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"And then, he goes on and talks about"},"513":{"dur":1,"text":"how important family is,"},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"and how important life is, not just work."},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"And he's essentially saying to Lou,"},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"when Lou is not famous yet, 1945,"},"522":{"dur":4,"text":"he's done a few nice\nworker housing projects"},"527":{"dur":3,"text":"that were good, but nothing\nto make him stand out"},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"in the world of architecture."},"531":{"dur":1,"text":"But already, there's this sense"},"533":{"dur":4,"text":"that he is focused on his\nwork, and his ambition."},"537":{"dur":3,"text":"And Oscar is saying to\nhim, look to your family,"},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"look to your beautiful child, Sue Ann,"},"542":{"dur":1,"text":"who's only five at this point,"},"544":{"dur":2,"text":"and watch her grow up into\na beautiful young lady."},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"And then, he says,"},"548":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Certainly, you will build\nthe first breathing wall.\""},"552":{"dur":1,"text":"Which is kind of a fascinating phrase,"},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"if you look at the walls of the Kimbell,"},"556":{"dur":1,"text":"when you go in there,"},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"at the way that concrete comes to life."},"561":{"dur":2,"text":"More than about 25 years"},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"before Lou ever built anything like that,"},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"his brother is saying,"},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Certainly, you will build\nthe first breathing wall.\""},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"But then, he says,"},"572":{"dur":4,"text":"\"Even skyscrapers have\ntheir height limitations,"},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"\"and so do our careers."},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"\"And you need to look to the personal,"},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"\"and someday, you will\nwant to get a splinter"},"582":{"dur":1,"text":"\"of the family

April of 1945."},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"And he died, suddenly,\nin December of 1945,"},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"a very young man."},"597":{"dur":1,"text":"41 years old."},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"And Lou kept this letter\nfor the rest of his life."},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"There it was, among his\npapers, when he died."},"604":{"dur":1,"text":"As far as we know, he never answered it."},"606":{"dur":1,"text":"But, reading this letter,"},"607":{"dur":3,"text":"I had the sense of a\nfamily member's insight"},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"into this person, who he was at the time,"},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"and who he would become,"},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"and some central quality of himself"},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"that was evident to his brother,"},"619":{"dur":3,"text":"before he even fully became himself."},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"The second incident, which\nis a very large incident,"},"625":{"dur":3,"text":"a whole psychology study,\ntook place in 1958,"},"629":{"dur":1,"text":"at UC Berkeley."},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"And this, I got the\nlead from Bill Whitaker,"},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"at the architectural

accumulated, somewhere."},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"\"It might've been Berkeley,\" he says."},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"\"And I don't know exactly what it is, but,"},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"\"it's really interesting material.\""},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"So, you can't use that kind of thing"},"659":{"dur":0,"text":"if you're a biographer."},"660":{"dur":1,"text":"You have to know where it comes from."},"662":{"dur":3,"text":"It has to be sourced, and\nit has to be verified."},"666":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I used the biographer's\nessential tool, Google."},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"I went online, and I found out,"},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"in Berkeley's psychology study,"},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"and I found that, in 1958,"},"677":{"dur":1,"text":"a man named Donald MacKinnon"},"678":{"dur":3,"text":"had run a psychological\nstudy of architects."},"682":{"dur":1,"text":"And he had asked everybody"},"683":{"dur":1,"text":"that he knew in the architectural world"},"685":{"dur":2,"text":"to nominate who they thought\nwere the best architects."},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, he had sift\nit down to 40 people."},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"And a lot of them were\nbig names at the time,"},"692":{"dur":3,"text":"Philip Johnson, and Richard\nNeutra, Charles Eames,"},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"various other famous architects."},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"And Louis Kahn was among them."},"699":{"dur":1,"text":"And at this point, in 1958,"},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"he had done the Trenton bathhouse,"},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"the Yale University Art Museum."},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"He had done a few private houses,"},"712":{"dur":3,"text":"and he had started on the\nRichards building, at Penn."},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"But, really, he was not a\nwell-known figure, in any way,"},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"but, within architecture,\nhe was already well known,"},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"and extremely well thought of."},"722":{"dur":1,"text":"And so, he came out to Berkeley"},"723":{"dur":3,"text":"and had a three-day battery\nof tests and interviews,"},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"all of which is residing in a warehouse"},"729":{"dur":1,"text":"in Richmond, California,"},"730":{"dur":1,"text":"just down the street from Berkeley."},"732":{"dur":1,"text":"Because I'm from Berkeley,"},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"I was able to get access\nto this stuff very easily."},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"I just called up the\npsychology department, and say,"},"738":{"dur":1,"text":"hey, can you show me that\nstuff in the warehouse?"},"739":{"dur":3,"text":"And we go over there,\nand I'm pawing through"},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"all of his psychology studies,"},"745":{"dur":3,"text":"because in 1958, there\nwas no human subjects

anybody."},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, there I am, looking\nat his Rorschach tests,"},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"and his Minnesota Multiphasic\nPersonality tests,"},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"and all these other\nthings, which, of course,"},"764":{"dur":1,"text":"mostly, are nonsense."},"765":{"dur":1,"text":"And in fact, Donald\nMacKinnon was never able"},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"to publish anything significant on"},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"the creativity of architects."},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"Because, when you do these\nthings in the aggregate,"},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"you don't really get\nanything very interesting."},"776":{"dur":3,"text":"But, there were some high points."},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"Many of the interviews that\nwere conducted with Lou"},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"got at personal memories he had,"},"784":{"dur":1,"text":"and thoughts about his family."},"785":{"dur":1,"text":"And so, all throughout my book,"},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"are quotations from those interviews."},"789":{"dur":1,"text":"He thought he was just talking to one guy,"},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"but, really, he was talking to posterity,"},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"so that his earliest\nchildhood memory is in there."},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"And his relationships with\nhis father, his mother,"},"798":{"dur":1,"text":"and his brother and sister are in there,"},"800":{"dur":3,"text":"and how he feels about architecture."},"803":{"dur":1,"text":"But also, how he feels about things"},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"like beauty and ugliness,\nsuccess and failure,"},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"all sorts of things like that."},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, there's one test,"},"812":{"dur":1,"text":"called the Thematic Apperception
