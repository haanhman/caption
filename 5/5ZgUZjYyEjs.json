He provides"},"880":{"dur":6,"text":"electrics, he does PAT testing, he does rewiring,\nhe does all the sorts of things that electricians"},"886":{"dur":5,"text":"do.

So what is it that you"},"897":{"dur":3,"text":"actually do? What is it that your business\ndoes? And it's not what you say that your"},"900":{"dur":3,"text":"business does, it's what your customers say\nthat your business does. So what are they"},"904":{"dur":5,"text":"gonna be searching for in relation to your\nbusiness when they're on Google? So, try and"},"909":{"dur":10,"text":"get into their mindset.

It's not just about where you currently"},"924":{"dur":1,"text":"operate your business."},"925":{"dur":7,"text":"JM: If you'd like to expand into Surrey, maybe\nJames has a page, \"Electrician in Surrey\","},"933":{"dur":7,"text":"\"Electrician in Hazlemere\", \"Electrician in\nGuildford\". And finally, who are your customers?"},"940":{"dur":8,"text":"So, with James, is it homeowners? Is it landlords?\nMain contractors?

But unless James has sat down\nand actually thought about this and written"},"972":{"dur":9,"text":"me down as a potential customer, he will not\nbe capturing my search and my business."},"981":{"dur":7,"text":"JM: So, you've got a big list of what you\ndo, where you do it and your customers, and"},"988":{"dur":6,"text":"we now need to try and capture all of this\nso we can start to expand. 'Cause when you"},"994":{"dur":4,"text":"start thinking about this, lots and lots of\ncombinations come out. I mean, I've just given"},"999":{"dur":8,"text":"a few examples here.

And just try, just put loads\nof things down here. There's no point in holding"},"1050":{"dur":5,"text":"back, and making assumptions as to what people\nare gonna put in. The more combinations you"},"1055":{"dur":5,"text":"can put in, the more results Google are gonna\ngive you back in terms of estimating how many"},"1060":{"dur":7,"text":"people are searching for that particular phrase.\nSo, it's really worth spending time at this"},"1067":{"dur":9,"text":"stage, brainstorming and expanding this list.\nRight, Google, free of charge, provides you"},"1076":{"dur":6,"text":"with a tool, and it estimates how many local\npeople, and when I say \"local\", it's actually"},"1083":{"dur":4,"text":"UK people rather than worldwide people, are\nsearching for that phrase."},"1088":{"dur":5,"text":"JM: And there are two... Actually, I've put\nthree columns down here. There's a cost per"},"1093":{"dur":4,"text":"click, I think it's nice to have that there,\nit doesn't particularly influence which ones"},"1098":{"dur":3,"text":"you're going for, but at least it shows you\nthe value, it gives an idea of a value of"},"1101":{"dur":5,"text":"that phrase.
