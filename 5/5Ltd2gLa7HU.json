do?"},"1358":{"dur":5,"text":"[Darris] The Passover is explicitly what Christ\nsaid to do."},"1363":{"dur":6,"text":"And He even pointed to the time of His second\ncoming when He would desire to do it again"},"1369":{"dur":3,"text":"in His Kingdom when He would sit down with\nHis disciples and do it then."},"1373":{"dur":5,"text":"So, when we do that today, we are following\nin those footsteps."},"1378":{"dur":8,"text":"The real benefit is that we are obeying what\nChrist taught us to do based on His example\u2014and"},"1386":{"dur":2,"text":"that is the only example that we can give."},"1389":{"dur":6,"text":"We cannot create out of thin cloth another\nfestival like Easter to take the place of"},"1395":{"dur":3,"text":"any part of what the Passover represents to\nus."},"1399":{"dur":6,"text":"And when we do that, we are following the\nexample of Christ and we\u2019re actually accomplishing"},"1405":{"dur":4,"text":"the one scripture in Galatians 2 where

the"},"1432":{"dur":2,"text":"night in which Jesus did."},"1434":{"dur":1,"text":"So that example is through the New Testament."},"1435":{"dur":4,"text":"[Steve] He even says, you proclaim My death\nby doing this very thing."},"1440":{"dur":6,"text":"And so, why do something that isn\u2019t found\nin the Bible, in that regard, and ignore something"},"1446":{"dur":1,"text":"that Christ said we should do."},"1448":{"dur":1,"text":"It seems so clear."},"1449":{"dur":2,"text":"[Gary] \u2026since He is the Passover."},"1451":{"dur":5,"text":"Maybe here in a little bit of time we have\nleft,
