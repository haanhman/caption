apprehend."},"538":{"dur":6,"text":"So what that means is this: when it comes\nto the love of Christ, we can't comprehend"},"544":{"dur":5,"text":"it but we can apprehend it."},"550":{"dur":8,"text":"We can't fully wrap our mind around it, but\nwe can lay hold of it and experience it."},"558":{"dur":6,"text":"This is a beautiful picture for us because\nthe actual love of Christ is mind-numbing"},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"for us."},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"And the reason that Paul is talking about\nthis idea of the love of Christ is because"},"569":{"dur":5,"text":"what it does for us in our relationship with\nGod is it actually stabilizes our relationship"},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"with God and gives us a foundation on which\nwe base this relationship."},"578":{"dur":4,"text":"In fact, when you look at the end of verse\nseventeen in our passage that we're looking"},"582":{"dur":7,"text":"at, he says that I pray that you, being

it is wide."},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"It's high."},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"It's long."},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"It's deep."},"615":{"dur":5,"text":"So Paul is basically explaining to us the\narchitecture of God's love in Christ."},"621":{"dur":3,"text":"That makes perfect sense, by the way, because\nwhat Paul was doing in chapter two is he had"},"625":{"dur":5,"text":"already started that mental picture for us\nbecause of how he refers to those of us that"},"630":{"dur":3,"text":"are in his church, those of us who belong\nto Jesus."},"633":{"dur":5,"text":"Listen to what he says in chapter two verse\ntwenty-one: In Jesus the whole building is"},"639":{"dur":4,"text":"joined together and rises to become a holy\ntemple in the Lord."},"644":{"dur":4,"text":"And in him you too are being built together\nto become a dwelling in which God lives by"},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"his Spirit."},"650":{"dur":4,"text":"So he planted a thought in the minds of the\nEphesians as they are reading this about the"},"655":{"dur":5,"text":"nature of the temple which for them was like\na wonder of the world, and this idea of a"},"660":{"dur":6,"text":"temple is one that has architecture, and he\nexplains the love of Christ based on the architecture"},"666":{"dur":7,"text":"of God's love, of how long and how high and\nhow wide and how deep the love of Christ is."},"673":{"dur":4,"text":"So, Paul was actually praying that we would\nbe able to grasp this in some way."},"678":{"dur":5,"text":"That in some way we'd be able to take hold\nof or apprehend the idea of his love, and"},"684":{"dur":4,"text":"so what I want us to do is I want us to begin\nover the next few weeks to think about the"},"688":{"dur":4,"text":"architecture of God's love for us in Christ."},"692":{"dur":5,"text":"And today here's what I want you to know:\nwhen you leave if somebody in the parking"},"697":{"dur":4,"text":"lot says - they're getting off work and they\njust say

bad English, but it's\ngood Hebrew, so I'm comfortable with that."},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"So all the people, right?"},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"That this was the idea that Israel was to\nbe."},"822":{"dur":4,"text":"In fact, when you read the prophet Isaiah\nin chapter forty-three and chapter forty-four"},"827":{"dur":2,"text":"and - you can go back and look at that if\nyou want,

as\nthe people of God was this idea of Israel."},"850":{"dur":2,"text":"But Israel got a little bit inverted."},"852":{"dur":4,"text":"Instead of doing what their mission was, in\ndemonstrating the
