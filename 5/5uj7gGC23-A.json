you see Robin Symes, on the left\nis Christo Michaelides."},"687":{"dur":5,"text":"In the 1980s, these men were the very tippy\ntop of the market in ancient art; they were"},"693":{"dur":4,"text":"dealers of antiquities; they had the very\nbest stuff out there."},"697":{"dur":4,"text":"And so good in fact that very few museums,\nAmerican museums, could afford to

seven and a half foot Cult\nStatute of a Goddess."},"737":{"dur":5,"text":"She had her breath taken away when she saw\nthis; nothing like this existed anywhere else"},"742":{"dur":1,"text":"in the world."},"744":{"dur":4,"text":"This is an acrolithic statute which means\nthat it's made of two different materials;"},"749":{"dur":3,"text":"you'll see that the head and the arms are\nmade out of a white marble, that's Parian"},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"Marble from the Green island of Paros; it's\none of the finest marbles there is."},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"The body is made of

kind of outskirts outside of Greece."},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"She knew from the fact that it was an acrolith\nthat it was almost certainly from southern"},"776":{"dur":1,"text":"Italy."},"778":{"dur":6,"text":"This technique was used when there was a shortage,\nthere was a scarcity, of actual local marble"},"784":{"dur":3,"text":"and so the extremities, the marble for the\nextremities would be imported from Greece"},"787":{"dur":4,"text":"itself, but in the colonies, in the Greek\ncolonies they would use the local limestone"},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"to carve the actual body."},"794":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, she knew three things when she saw this\nstatute."},"798":{"dur":4,"text":"First of all, she knew that this was an incredibly\nimportant piece of art."},"803":{"dur":3,"text":"As I said there was nothing like it anywhere\nelse in the world; the closest reference she"},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"could come up with was the Parthenon Friezes."},"809":{"dur":6,"text":"When Pheidias had sculpted those sculptures\nwhich we sometimes refer to as the Elgin Marbles,"},"815":{"dur":3,"text":"they're now in the British Museum in London;\nwhen Pheidias the Greek sculptor had sculpted"},"819":{"dur":6,"text":"these he had developed a new style, a new\nartistic technique and this goddess was a"},"825":{"dur":1,"text":"direct reflection of that."},"826":{"dur":7,"text":"It was this wet drapery style and so it was\na clear reference right back to what our historians"},"834":{"dur":5,"text":"would consider really the apex of Western\ncivilization, the highest moment of classical"},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"Greece that you can come up with."},"842":{"dur":5,"text":"And so it was enormously important for that\nas she wrote later in her proposal there was"},"848":{"dur":7,"text":"nothing like this anywhere outside of Athens\nitself or Great Britain, meaning the Elgin"},"855":{"dur":1,"text":"Marbles in the British Museum."},"857":{"dur":5,"text":"So it was clear that this kind of acquisition,\nan object of this caliber, could immediately"},"862":{"dur":3,"text":"put the Getty on the map, make it a credible\ninstitution in the eyes of its East Coast"},"866":{"dur":6,"text":"peers, and would be a career making acquisition\nfor a young curator like Marian True."},"872":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, there were other things that were also\nimmediately clear about the statute."},"877":{"dur":4,"text":"If you look at these photographs of the statute\nbefore restoration you see that before she"},"882":{"dur":2,"text":"was cleaned up she was a little bit dirty."},"884":{"dur":5,"text":"On her face, you can see the encrustation,\nthat's not acne she has that's actual dirt"},"890":{"dur":2,"text":"that's been encrusted there over the centuries."},"892":{"dur":6,"text":"And if you look at the limestone body of the\nstatute you'll see that there are two prominent"},"899":{"dur":5,"text":"break points: one in the waist and another\nat the knees."},"904":{"dur":4,"text":"Now when she walked up to the statute, she\nran her finger along those cracks and they"},"908":{"dur":4,"text":"were sharp; they'd been recently made."},"912":{"dur":5,"text":"Ancient statutes with ancient breaks wear\ndown over time and so they wouldn't be sharp"},"918":{"dur":1,"text":"breaks like that."},"919":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, all of these things were a clear indication\nthat this statute had been recently found"},"924":{"dur":5,"text":"and judging by the fact that it was an acrolith,\nit must have been found in southern Italy"},"929":{"dur":5,"text":"or Sicily and so this bore all the clear signs\nof looting."},"934":{"dur":4,"text":"Closer inspection showed that it actually\nstill had dirt in the folds of the gown."},"939":{"dur":4,"text":"Now when she asked Robin Symes, \"Where did\nthis thing come from?\""},"943":{"dur":2,"text":"She was very curious because it had never\nbeen studied before."},"946":{"dur":6,"text":"Art historians and archaeologists and scholars\nof classical art are very passionate and very"},"952":{"dur":4,"text":"diligent researchers and anything of this\nsize or proportion even it had been in a private"},"957":{"dur":4,"text":"collection would have been known and documented\nif it had known to exist."},"961":{"dur":3,"text":"So this thing was completely out of nowhere."},"964":{"dur":1,"text":"Robin Symes wouldn't say much about where\nit was from."},"966":{"dur":4,"text":"He said he'd gotten it from a Swiss supermarket\nmagnate who had had it in his family collection"},"971":{"dur":1,"text":"since the 30s."},"973":{"dur":3,"text":"And that was good enough and fine for Marion\nTrue."},"976":{"dur":4,"text":"The decision to acquire it wasn't hers; it\nwas really her boss's decision."},"980":{"dur":4,"text":"But she knew very well that this thing bore\nclear signs of being a recent discovery and"},"985":{"dur":4,"text":"therefore it was hot; it was potentially dangerous\nfor the museum to be involved with."},"990":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, this created a dilemma and it was not\na new dilemma for the Getty."},"994":{"dur":4,"text":"The Getty had been wrestling with the issue\nof whether and how to acquire antiquities"},"998":{"dur":5,"text":"particularly antiquities that appeared to\nhave been recently excavated for many years."},"1004":{"dur":5,"text":"The decision really fell to these two men:\nJohn Walsh on the left was the Director of"},"1010":{"dur":1,"text":"the Getty Museum at the time."},"1011":{"dur":7,"text":"He was a very respected curator at the Metropolitan\nMuseum of Art; his specialty was Dutch art."},"1018":{"dur":5,"text":"He was really one of the leading up and coming\nmuseum figures in the country and he had been"},"1024":{"dur":3,"text":"brought to the Getty to kind of bring seriousness\nto the Getty Museum."},"1027":{"dur":3,"text":"And his boss was Harold Williams."},"1030":{"dur":4,"text":"Harold Williams was the CEO of the Getty Trust,\nthe umbrella foundation over the museum."},"1035":{"dur":5,"text":"Harold Williams also had a pretty good lineage;\nhe had worked for Carter, he was the Chairman"},"1041":{"dur":3,"text":"of the Securities and

credible"},"1050":{"dur":4,"text":"person who could manage this enormous endowment;\nhe had been trained as a lawyer."},"1055":{"dur":3,"text":"So John and Harold had been going back and\nforth for several years over this question"},"1059":{"dur":2,"text":"about antiquities, the antiquities collection."},"1062":{"dur":3,"text":"The Getty was aggressively trying to build\nits collection but it kept running up into"},"1066":{"dur":3,"text":"this issue, which is a lot of these objects\non the market, in fact Harold Williams had"},"1070":{"dur":5,"text":"been told 95 percent of the objects on the\nmarket, had been recently excavated."},"1076":{"dur":5,"text":"And under not just foreign law but also American\nlaw, knowingly buying something that had been"},"1081":{"dur":5,"text":"looted from a country that had a patrimony\nlaw like Italy's that said, \"Objects in the"},"1087":{"dur":7,"text":"ground belong to the state,\" doing that under\nAmerican law was a violation of the

concerned about it."},"1105":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, John Walsh was a museum guy and he made\nthe case to Harold, he said, \"Look Harold"},"1110":{"dur":5,"text":"this has been going on for decades, this is\nhow we buy these things."},"1115":{"dur":7,"text":"And yes there's some risk involved but these\ncases are almost never proven and furthermore"},"1123":{"dur":2,"text":"don't we have a moral
