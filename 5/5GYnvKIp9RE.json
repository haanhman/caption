way."},"319":{"dur":1,"text":"Now the one thing\nI will tell you"},"320":{"dur":1,"text":"is that the chat can move fast."},"322":{"dur":1,"text":"So if you are in\nthe watch and

an x in the\nlast one, or one even."},"365":{"dur":2,"text":"But you do need to put three\nthings in to populate that."},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"So let us know."},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"Also, do tell us at which\nlevel you're studying,"},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"and which subject\narea you're studying."},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"And we'd like to think about\nhow you feel about

introduce those\nthroughout the programme."},"384":{"dur":0,"text":"OK."},"385":{"dur":1,"text":"So let's have a look then."},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"We've got a wordle here with\njust some very brief terms"},"389":{"dur":1,"text":"about how people are feeling."},"390":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's lots and lots\nof different emotions."},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'm really pleased\nthat so many of

anxious."},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"And that is really, really\nnormal, because for some of you"},"408":{"dur":1,"text":"this is a completely\nnew journey."},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"And those feelings are\nabsolutely natural."},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"And we hope that we can\nalleviate some of those fears"},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"throughout this session."},"417":{"dur":3,"text":"OK I think I have introduced\neverything, hopefully"},"420":{"dur":1,"text":"that we have to introduce."},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"But no doubt there will be\nmore as people are popping in."},"423":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'm going to introduce\nGeorgina Blakeley."},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"Georgina, welcome to the studio."},"426":{"dur":1,"text":"GEORGINA BLAKELEY: Hi."},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Now,

Home."},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"This is really,\nreally important."},"443":{"dur":1,"text":"How do students\ntend to feel when"},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"they first, from your experience\nas chair of somebody who's"},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"starting a new module, how do\npeople feel about all of this?"},"450":{"dur":1,"text":"There's so much\ninformation here."},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"I think students have already\nsummed that up really well."},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"They feel really excited,\nbecause there's everything"},"457":{"dur":1,"text":"there and you can't\nwait to get started."},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"And as someone said, it's like\ngetting the box in the post."},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"You want to open it up\nand see what's inside."},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"But at the same time they\nfeel very nervous and anxious"},"467":{"dur":3,"text":"as well, because it's difficult\nto know what to look at,"},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"what to do first."},"472":{"dur":1,"text":"Students often say,\nI'm waiting for someone"},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"to tell me what to do."},"476":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's taking that\nfirst step, really,"},"478":{"dur":1,"text":"that I think students\nfind very daunting."},"480":{"dur":1,"text":"So what should they do, then?"},"482":{"dur":0,"text":"GEORGINA BLAKELEY:\nWhat should they do?"},"483":{"dur":0,"text":"A very good question."},"484":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Can they break\nanything on this, by the way?"},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"GEORGINA BLAKELEY:\nAbsolutely not."},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"Before the module starts, and\nthat's where students are now,"},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"most modules\nhaven't started yet."},"492":{"dur":3,"text":"So you've got some time to make\nthe most of that enthusiasm"},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"and that desire to get started."},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"So I would advise students\nto just start clicking."},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"Once you're on Student\nHome, use that as your base."},"502":{"dur":0,"text":"And then go from there."},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"You really can't break anything."},"505":{"dur":1,"text":"You won't spoil it for\nany other students."},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you fill in something\nor press something,"},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"you haven't then altered\nit for every other student"},"512":{"dur":0,"text":"on your module."},"513":{"dur":0,"text":"So just have a go."},"514":{"dur":1,"text":"You really can't break anything."},"515":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: But\nthere's a lot here."},"516":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, we're looking\nat some of these things."},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can see there's\nprofile

on\nmost Open University module"},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"websites, or\nwebsites in general,"},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"it's the central column\nthat's really important."},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"And you'll see here for\nthis student who's kindly"},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"let us use his website,\nhis Student Home website,"},"544":{"dur":2,"text":"at the start you've got\nthe central column there"},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"which tells you which\nqualification you're on."},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"And this student is studying\npolitics, philosophy,"},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"and economics."},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"Unfortunately, this\nstudent isn't actually"},"553":{"dur":1,"text":"doing any modules at the moment."},"555":{"dur":3,"text":"But what you'd also see\nin this central column"},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"is a list of modules that\nthis student is doing."},"561":{"dur":2,"text":"And from there, you click\nonto your module websites."},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"And I would say that if\nyou're starting as a student,"},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"it's your module website that's\nmost important, because that"},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"will tell you what\nto do and when."},"571":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: OK."},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"So shall we have a look at\none of the module websites?"},"574":{"dur":0,"text":"Let's have a go."},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"They do say never\nwork with technology."},"576":{"dur":0,"text":"But here we go."},"577":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Oh, I know."},"579":{"dur":0,"text":"GEORGINA BLAKELEY: And it works."},"580":{"dur":0,"text":"Ta da!"},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"You'll see this is actually\nan old module website."},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"It's for the 14J\npresentation of DD 102."},"587":{"dur":3,"text":"But this will look\nexactly the same for 16J."},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"So again, you'll see this\ncentral column down the

really\nlike is you can"},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"see the little column, which\nwe saw at the top earlier,"},"633":{"dur":3,"text":"which showed you where that was\nin relation to other things."},"636":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, sometimes I think it's\nabout getting a sense of scope."},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"How much there is and\nwhat you've got to do"},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"and how it all works."},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"So basically\neverything is populated"},"645":{"dur":1,"text":"in some sort of sensible order."},"647":{"dur":1,"text":"And I guess if people don't\nwant to watch the video,"},"648":{"dur":0,"text":"they don't have to."},"649":{"dur":0,"text":"They don't have to."},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"There's kind of two ways\nof navigating it,

really."},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"Or you can use the\ntop of every page."},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"And the bottom of every page\nthere'll be a Next button."},"664":{"dur":1,"text":"So you can go

the week 1\nmodule start and et cetera."},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"GEORGINA BLAKELEY: Yeah."},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're here at the very start\nin the module

website"},"682":{"dur":1,"text":"will be very similar to that."},"683":{"dur":1,"text":"So although this\nis DD 102, they'll"},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"all look pretty similar."},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"So most of the links\nthen that people need"},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"are sort of embedded\nwithin each week."},"692":{"dur":3,"text":"So is that the same, then,\nfor things like assignments,"},"695":{"dur":1,"text":"or things like forums?"},"697":{"dur":3,"text":"And is this the place\nthat has it all?"},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"GEORGINA BLAKELEY:

get\nthat with your books."},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"But you also get another\nbox online as well."},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"And everything is in there\nthat you can possibly
