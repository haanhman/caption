[laughter]"},"328":{"dur":5,"text":"So you know, you turn it over, so the other side gets done. [chuckles] That's how, the"},"333":{"dur":6,"text":"way you can do it. How to see non-self and rebirth? Once you see there's no one there,"},"340":{"dur":5,"text":"there's no one to get reborn again anymore. So that's the end of rebirth.

You know, but some"},"479":{"dur":5,"text":"people understand that, as Buddhists, we've got the goods on all this reincarnation business."},"484":{"dur":6,"text":"We understand what's going on. And interestingly they said, when this little 5, 10 days old"},"491":{"dur":6,"text":"baby spoke, it was not in baby speech. It was like an adult speech. You know how the"},"497":{"dur":4,"text":"baby talks, very high pitched when they first start talking but this was like an adult speech"},"502":{"dur":5,"text":"but coming out of the baby's mouth. And when I told that story, a Malaysian couple came"},"508":{"dur":4,"text":"up to me, they said the same happened to them and they never told anybody because they thought,"},"513":{"dur":5,"text":"if they said what they've heard, their baby spoke when it was first born, they think they"},"518":{"dur":3,"text":"were crazy and no one would take them seriously. They say it's absolutely true. I know the"},"521":{"dur":8,"text":"couple, regular supporters and they say, our baby spoke as well. And the best case, which"},"530":{"dur":7,"text":"I, reason why I tell the story, United States...in the maternity ward, the baby came out, in"},"537":{"dur":4,"text":"front of the mid-wives and the doctor, and as soon as the baby came out of the womb still"},"542":{"dur":8,"text":"attached to the umbilical cord, looked around and spoke. But the words he spoke were just"},"551":{"dur":7,"text":"amazing. What he said as he looked around was, \"Oh, no, not again.\" [laughter] That's"},"559":{"dur":10,"text":"a classic. And who was the fourth person who spoke when they were born? The Buddha, yeah,"},"569":{"dur":4,"text":"maybe he did. So if you see there's no one in there, there's no one to be reborn any"},"574":{"dur":8,"text":"more. Dear Ajahn, was ss...(I'm not supposed to talk about spirits) Will, you know what,"},"582":{"dur":4,"text":"around ask for dhamma talk? If so, how do they come forward, is there a condition to"},"587":{"dur":7,"text":"do so? Thank you. What they do, is they write it on a piece of paper and they put it in"},"594":{"dur":9,"text":"the box. [laughter] Can spirits write? Seems that they can because often they leave messages."},"603":{"dur":6,"text":"This is... don't be scared, this is a nice ghost story, and it really is a beautiful"},"609":{"dur":5,"text":"one, one of my favourite ones. It was here in, I think it was actually in Perth, it was"},"615":{"dur":6,"text":"an elderly couple and they were living in an old people's home. Family hardly ever visited"},"621":{"dur":6,"text":"them, actually I think, one of them didn't have a family in Australia. I think he said"},"628":{"dur":6,"text":"that he had a sister in England somewhere, and that's all he said. And because he was"},"634":{"dur":5,"text":"a man, elderly man, an elderly lady living in the next room to each other. The woman"},"640":{"dur":4,"text":"would sometimes cook him something and he would sort of fix up things for her. There"},"644":{"dur":5,"text":"was no romantic relationship. It was just like friendship, two old people looking after"},"650":{"dur":8,"text":"one another. And when he died, no one knew about where his relations were. She'd only"},"659":{"dur":7,"text":"heard him say that he had a relation, a sister in England, somewhere. And they had to do"},"666":{"dur":6,"text":"the funeral service for him without being able to contact anybody. And she said, a few"},"673":{"dur":7,"text":"days after the funeral service, she was in bed and she felt, certainly not asleep, she"},"680":{"dur":8,"text":"felt somebody stroke her cheek very gently. She woke up and, of course, first of all"},"688":{"dur":5,"text":"you'd think it's a burglar, someone's coming in to, to do you wrong. But she turned on"},"693":{"dur":5,"text":"the bedside lamp, there was no one in the room at all. Everything was locked. But what"},"699":{"dur":5,"text":"she did have, was a piece of tissue paper on her bedside table. And she saw that piece"},"704":{"dur":6,"text":"of tissue paper lift up and fall to the floor and there was no wind at all, and she opened"},"711":{"dur":6,"text":"up that piece of paper and there were numbers on it. And she rang those numbers and it was"},"718":{"dur":7,"text":"this man's sister. Really beautiful. The man realised that his sister needed to be called"},"725":{"dur":5,"text":"and knew that she was very worried about this, and so very gently caressed her and made the"},"731":{"dur":4,"text":"piece of paper fall so she would open it up to see it was a telephone number there. And"},"735":{"dur":7,"text":"so they managed to tell the sister. So those are nice stories, that's usually what happens. So"},"743":{"dur":4,"text":"that's why, they say, they want to talk, they'd write on a piece of paper. [chuckles] Is it"},"747":{"dur":5,"text":"okay for lay men, lay women to take their own time to exit from samsara? Some may not"},"753":{"dur":7,"text":"want to be still so fast, thank you so much for your compassion. Of course, no one can"},"761":{"dur":6,"text":"force you to come out of samsara but after a while, you think you've had enough. I know"},"767":{"dur":6,"text":"some friends they finish university and then they go back there and they just, you know,"},"774":{"dur":4,"text":"30, 40, 50 and they're still at university. They just like the place. They just like studying"},"778":{"dur":7,"text":"they're perpetual, sort of, students. And they don't want to leave, which is quite weird."},"785":{"dur":5,"text":"There are some people who're in jail and they don't want to leave either. They got used"},"791":{"dur":6,"text":"to jail and they're scared of coming out. So I like to use those type, sorts of similes"},"797":{"dur":8,"text":"because we're used to samsara, and even though it's a jail, we don't want to come out, even"},"806":{"dur":4,"text":"though the door's open. No, we don't want to go through because even though this is"},"810":{"dur":4,"text":"a bit of suffering, disappointment, at least it's the suffering we know. We're a bit scared"},"815":{"dur":7,"text":"of what happens when we let go. So that's what happens here, in this meditation, this"},"822":{"dur":4,"text":"practice. One of the reasons why you don't let go, you're in prison, you're in a jail,"},"826":{"dur":4,"text":"but you got used to it. And just like that prisoner, they'd rather stay their whole life"},"831":{"dur":8,"text":"and die in jail than go outside into freedom. Sometimes freedom, it's scary. But you know,"},"840":{"dur":4,"text":"whenever you want to, basically, I haven't told this yet, but you know, it's not your"},"844":{"dur":8,"text":"choice. We always think we're in control. This is the understanding of the nature of"},"853":{"dur":10,"text":"will, did you decide to come on this retreat? Did you really, or were you brainwashed?"},"863":{"dur":8,"text":"It was put into your mind, as a suggestion by Ajahn Brahm. [laughter] Was it really your"},"871":{"dur":7,"text":"choice? It looks like it, it seems like it but it wasn't. You had no choice, you had"},"878":{"dur":10,"text":"to come here. You've been brainwashed without knowing it. He...he..he. [laughter] So in"},"889":{"dur":5,"text":"the end it's not your choice. You're going to get out of samsara whether you like it"},"894":{"dur":7,"text":"or not. When you say insight meditation, do you mean that during meditation you gain certain"},"902":{"dur":6,"text":"insights about your life events, etc. you didn't have before? If so, isn't these insights"},"908":{"dur":6,"text":"part of thinking or at least when they arise they came to you as thought, is it correct?"},"914":{"dur":6,"text":"The insight comes first but we understand it by sort of using thought, using words to"},"921":{"dur":8,"text":"describe our experiences. But the insight is much more fundamental than the thoughts."},"930":{"dur":5,"text":"The thoughts is just how explains these things to us. Cos there's many things in life"},"935":{"dur":7,"text":"which thoughts just cannot describe. I use an example, a very simple example. Now, can you experience"},"942":{"dur":7,"text":"the feeling in your bottom, right now? Now can you describe that to me? We just don't"},"949":{"dur":7,"text":"have a language, not in English or in Mandarin or Hokkien or Bahasa to describe the feeling"},"956":{"dur":4,"text":"of, you know, when you're sitting down on the bottom. We just haven't got the language"},"961":{"dur":7,"text":"for that but it's real. There's so many experiences in life we haven't got words for. That's"},"969":{"dur":7,"text":"one of the reasons why that words are just so limiting and why sometimes you get into some very deep meditation"},"976":{"dur":4,"text":"experiences and it's so hard to describe them. You just haven't got the words there. The"},"981":{"dur":5,"text":"concepts are not there. I know they, I've read this in a book. When I first read this,"},"987":{"dur":4,"text":"I thought this is crazy, it can't be true. But understanding more about the nature of"},"991":{"dur":5,"text":"the mind, maybe it was true. They say when the Indians, I think it was, the country now"},"997":{"dur":6,"text":"is Dominican Republic, when the natives there saw Columbus come in his boat, these huge"},"1003":{"dur":5,"text":"ships, they could not see the ships, even though they were right in front of them. Their"},"1009":{"dur":7,"text":"eyes could see it but the mind could not deal with this concept, of a ship. So it was right"},"1016":{"dur":5,"text":"there but they couldn't see it. The language, the concepts were not there to understand"},"1021":{"dur":6,"text":"it. So basically it was not registered in their mind. The eyes could see but the mind"},"1027":{"dur":6,"text":"couldn't understand therefore it didn't register. Fascinating idea, which is one of the reasons"},"1034":{"dur":6,"text":"why we miss so much, and when we get into deep meditation, we can learn how to know"},"1040":{"dur":8,"text":"without these concepts, without the words. There's a much more beautiful and accurate"},"1049":{"dur":8,"text":"knowing. So that's what happens sometimes and insight, we see and then we try to explain"},"1057":{"dur":8,"text":"it. Sometimes, it's hardly, so difficult to explain. Would a meditator die well? How did"},"1065":{"dur":7,"text":"Ajahn Chah die? He stopped breathing [laughter] and his heart stopped, that's how he died."},"1072":{"dur":6,"text":"[chuckles] Of course they will die well. The reason why people don't die well it's cos"},"1079":{"dur":5,"text":"they're too clingy, they're too attached and they're too afraid. In fact if you really"},"1084":{"dur":6,"text":"get into the deep meditations like the jhanas or even to the nimittas, I've mentioned that"},"1090":{"dur":6,"text":"everybody sees the nimitta sooner or later, cos you see it when you die. 5 senses stop"},"1097":{"dur":6,"text":"working and just like in the near death experiences you float up towards the light, that's exactly"},"1103":{"dur":4,"text":"the same as you see in deep meditation, the nimitta experience and you go through the"},"1108":{"dur":5,"text":"light and depends on what, how you deal with that, depends on whether you get reborn or"},"1114":{"dur":5,"text":"where you get reborn. That's exactly what you're doing in this meditation, you're letting"},"1119":{"dur":6,"text":"the 5 senses disappear, suppress them, so it's as if they're dying and you go into this beautiful"},"1125":{"dur":6,"text":"light, this is actually death training. This is a death training camp. You're learning"},"1131":{"dur":6,"text":"how to die. [laughter] Dying 101 at Jhana Grove meditation or death training retreat"},"1138":{"dur":8,"text":"centre. And what happens if you do get, this is a powerful thing, you do get insight into"},"1146":{"dur":6,"text":"the nature of the body and the mind, because you experience when this 5 senses, so the"},"1152":{"dur":6,"text":"5 senses vanish when the mind appears, you have experience of this. So when that happens"},"1159":{"dur":5,"text":"for, you know, permanently and you die, you recognise what's going on, so you don't get"},"1165":{"dur":5,"text":"so afraid. You know exactly what's going to happen. You know, when you're prepared, when"},"1170":{"dur":4,"text":"you know what's going to happen, it takes away a lot of the stress when you've trained"},"1175":{"dur":6,"text":"beforehand. And because of that, you don't attach to the 5 senses, you can let them go,"},"1181":{"dur":5,"text":"because you learnt how to let them go in deep meditation, which means you die beautifully."},"1187":{"dur":6,"text":"It's no problem at all, and you're not afraid because, in those states, it's like you realise"},"1194":{"dur":8,"text":"this is what dying is like. And as most people say, who had near death experiences, dying"},"1203":{"dur":7,"text":"is painful but death is beautiful. It's a process going to that point to leave the body,"},"1210":{"dur":5,"text":"that's the difficult one for many people. But actually, once you've passed that point, and"},"1216":{"dur":4,"text":"you've left the body, it's blissful, it's beautiful, you're having a great time, which"},"1220":{"dur":7,"text":"means people who come back are never afraid of death, of dying, yes, but not of death. And it's that"},"1227":{"dur":8,"text":"classic story which I saw on a documentary from the BBC.... this woman died on the operating table"},"1236":{"dur":7,"text":"and floated out of her body, and was having a wonderful time, so free, you got no aches,"},"1243":{"dur":5,"text":"no pains, a lot of bliss, a lot of energy, oh, it's just so wonderful, once you get out"},"1249":{"dur":8,"text":"of this sick, old, dead, fat body. And, she was floating around and having a great time"},"1258":{"dur":7,"text":"and she met this other spirit who said, \"It's not your time to die. You still got unfinished"},"1265":{"dur":6,"text":"business, you have to go back.\" And that's when this English girl said, \"No way. I'm"},"1272":{"dur":6,"text":"not going back to the old body of mine.\" And so they had an argument on the psychic plane....backwards"},"1278":{"dur":5,"text":"and forwards, you have to go back... no, I am not going!...But you must, it's not your"},"1284":{"dur":5,"text":"time!...I don't care, I'm not going back! and had this big argument apparently and it"},"1289":{"dur":6,"text":"was only settled when this spirit, somehow, managed to grab hold of her and throw her"},"1296":{"dur":5,"text":"back into her body on the operating table, and she came back alive again. Now when she"},"1301":{"dur":5,"text":"was interviewed by the BBC about the whole experience, it's a wonderful little documentary"},"1306":{"dur":6,"text":"because you can see her anger towards that spirit, [laughter] when she said, \"When I die"},"1313":{"dur":5,"text":"next time, when I do die next time, I'm going to find that guy and you wouldn't believe"},"1318":{"dur":4,"text":"what I'm going to do to him! What he did to me, sending me back here. Never again! I'm"},"1322":{"dur":7,"text":"going to sort that guy out!\" [laughter] And I like telling that story because it shows"},"1330":{"dur":5,"text":"just how beautiful was the state after death. And I keep on saying, nimittas, you know,"},"1335":{"dur":6,"text":"the bliss better than sex. The beautiful ecstasy when you leave, you know, the 5 senses below"},"1342":{"dur":5,"text":"the delightful breath and the beauty of this thing, this is what you are experiencing in"},"1347":{"dur":5,"text":"a deep meditation and yeah, this is what's going to happen to you when you die. Bring it on,"},"1353":{"dur":7,"text":"as Mr. George W. Bush used to say. [laughter] So it takes away all your fear of death when"},"1360":{"dur":5,"text":"you get into deep meditation. You get to understand what happens and why it happens and what it"},"1366":{"dur":8,"text":"feels like. Once you have the deep meditation, you're not afraid of death, at all. Venerable"},"1374":{"dur":6,"text":"Sir, is it important that we reach jhanas in this lifetime? If not, what will happen?"},"1380":{"dur":8,"text":"You still got another 2 days left. [laughter] Nothing is that important in life. If you"},"1389":{"dur":4,"text":"don't reach it in this lifetime, you can have another go in your next lifetime. That's a"},"1393":{"dur":7,"text":"wonderful thing about Buddhism, no rush la, take your time. Doesn't work in this lifetime,"},"1401":{"dur":6,"text":"you got endless other lifetimes to catch up, so that's why you can take it easy, just like"},"1407":{"dur":5,"text":"in this retreat. If you want to sleep, you can sleep, you want to go for a walk in the"},"1412":{"dur":6,"text":"forest, walk in the forest, don't rush. Why you're rushing so fast? This is not Singapore"},"1419":{"dur":6,"text":"in the rush hour. [laughter] This is just Jhana Grove, you can take your tiiime to become enlightened,"},"1425":{"dur":6,"text":"because if you go fast, you end up getting nowhere. But if you go slowly, it's amazing"},"1432":{"dur":11,"text":"how deep you go. So remember it's being still, being here, is where you enter the jhanas."},"1444":{"dur":7,"text":"Trying to get there is wasting time. So it's important, I'm sure get jhanas sooner or later,"},"1451":{"dur":9,"text":"if not in this lifetime, another one, guaranteed, otherwise your money back. [chuckles] Hope"},"1461":{"dur":5,"text":"you're not going to ask your money back from the BF if you didn't get jhana on this retreat."},"1466":{"dur":7,"text":"Dear Ajahn Brahm, Is it possible to see future lives in our meditation? Future life? Future"},"1474":{"dur":7,"text":"is so uncertain because you are always changing things. We may have a sort of future direction"},"1481":{"dur":7,"text":"but you can turn left, you can turn right because the future is work in progress, so"},"1488":{"dur":8,"text":"it can always be changed. Yes, sometimes you can have these images, and did I, I think"},"1497":{"dur":7,"text":"I told this little story in Malaysia, in the retreat there last week, or was it here, the"},"1505":{"dur":8,"text":"best friend who had 3 visions.

Just trying,"},"3070":{"dur":7,"text":"knowing, just by simple reason there can't be an all powerful, all compassionate God."},"3078":{"dur":6,"text":"So that type of being, who you think that God is looking after you and when you pray"},"3084":{"dur":4,"text":"to God, the God can answer you.

And that is the sort of type of God which"},"3193":{"dur":8,"text":"is actually dangerous, because it makes people be really, really dumb and stupid. [laughter]"},"3202":{"dur":5,"text":"So that type of God, absolutely no way but please, don't be stupid and believe what is"},"3208":{"dur":6,"text":"really ridiculous.

So when he"},"3287":{"dur":5,"text":"asked me a question, I realised you can't give a funny answer, not my usual cheeky"},"3293":{"dur":7,"text":"flippant response. And the question was \"Do Buddhists believe in God?\" And so, my answer"},"3301":{"dur":4,"text":"was, I said - My friend here, Abbot Placid have known him a long time, we've done many"},"3306":{"dur":6,"text":"things together, and he always tells me that his fundamental belief is that everyone is"},"3313":{"dur":6,"text":"searching for God. That's very easy to reject such things as a Buddhist, but this is my"},"3319":{"dur":7,"text":"friend. So I listened to what he says. So what do Buddhists search for? What we're searching"},"3327":{"dur":7,"text":"for is peace, freedom, wisdom, insight, contentment, that's what you're here for. So I say, all"},"3335":{"dur":6,"text":"the Buddhists I know, they're searching for love, freedom, respect, kindness, contentment,"},"3341":{"dur":6,"text":"so that's what they're searching for, everyone's searching for God, that must be what God is."},"3348":{"dur":5,"text":"And when I said that Father Frank Brennan said, the best answer I've ever got. Thank"},"3353":{"dur":6,"text":"you.

So that's a"},"3366":{"dur":7,"text":"nice thing to believe in and worship - kindness, love, forgiveness. If we can do that, we wouldn't"},"3374":{"dur":6,"text":"have these stupid wars, stupid sort of trying to convert each other. We can actually just"},"3380":{"dur":5,"text":"love each other instead.

There was a tadpole who lived in a lake and the tadpole,"},"4001":{"dur":6,"text":"she was a very smart girl, you know, the frogs came and taught meditation"},"4007":{"dur":5,"text":"retreats in the lake. She went to every meditation retreat. She actually learned Abdhidhamma"},"4012":{"dur":9,"text":"by these wise Burmese frogs. And all the time, she thought, she went to Chemistry school"},"4021":{"dur":5,"text":"as well, so she knew that water was H2O. And she knew nama rupa and these are 4 elements"},"4027":{"dur":5,"text":"and what is actually water and what is according to Abhidhamma and she can meditate in the"},"4033":{"dur":6,"text":"lake on water.

And then one day, the"},"4052":{"dur":5,"text":"little tadpole she grew some legs and some things from her front, it wasn't breast, it"},"4058":{"dur":9,"text":"was legs, arms coming out. And she became a frog. And one day, the tadpole, now a frog"},"4067":{"dur":7,"text":"just jumped and it landed on a very weird place, very scary at first, there's no water"},"4075":{"dur":6,"text":"around. It was outside the lake, on dry land and that was the weirdest experience she'd"},"4081":{"dur":6,"text":"ever known, totally different and everything she'd ever known, really weird and quite scary"},"4088":{"dur":9,"text":"too. But then she reflected, something is missing, something which has always been here"},"4097":{"dur":10,"text":"all my life is no longer here... water. Now, tadpole, now a frog can understand what water"},"4108":{"dur":11,"text":"is, only when its left, disappeared. That is a wonderful simile of why you need jhanas"},"4119":{"dur":6,"text":"to become enlightened. If you haven't left the 5 senses, seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting"},"4126":{"dur":6,"text":"and touching, you can't understand them. No matter how many times you reflect on seeing,"},"4133":{"dur":5,"text":"hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, no matter what you read about them, you don't know what they"},"4138":{"dur":6,"text":"are, cos you've born in these things, they're always there, this body is always there because"},"4144":{"dur":6,"text":"of that you don't understand it, which is why people think it's all happiness and fun."},"4151":{"dur":7,"text":"But one day, you little tadpoles, you will grow these beautiful legs, delightful breath"},"4158":{"dur":8,"text":"and nimittas and you will jump and you will be in jhana. Wow, that is so weird like nothing"},"4167":{"dur":7,"text":"you've ever experienced before. I mean that, totally different, and you will notice something is"},"4174":{"dur":6,"text":"missing. In the first jhana your body is missing, you can't feel your legs even if you wanted"},"4180":{"dur":6,"text":"to, you can't hear sounds, even if someone shouts at you, it's totally gone. Now you've"},"4187":{"dur":7,"text":"got an idea of what the 5 senses and the body are, only through the first jhana. In the"},"4195":{"dur":8,"text":"second jhana, your will goes, this choice, this decision making, this controller, totally"},"4203":{"dur":6,"text":"vanishes, it's not there anymore.

You think you did,"},"4228":{"dur":5,"text":"that's the illusion. Once you get into second jhana, you'll say, my God, Ajahn Brahm was"},"4233":{"dur":9,"text":"right.

A Bhante once told me that if one is a ordained as"},"4306":{"dur":6,"text":"a monk or a nun, then they would have lesser rebirth into samsara, there's a high chance"},"4313":{"dur":5,"text":"to get into enlightenment as monks nuns have more peace and discipline in their practice."},"4318":{"dur":4,"text":"Does it mean the lay person will have many rebirths and longer then taken to reach nibbana?"},"4323":{"dur":4,"text":"No, it doesn't matter if you are, it does, it's easier as a monk, as long as you are"},"4328":{"dur":6,"text":"a good monk and keep the precepts. They had a very good simile in the visudhimagga. Said"},"4335":{"dur":7,"text":"like a monk, it's like someone who rides on an elephant, a lay person rides on a horse."},"4342":{"dur":5,"text":"So you know, you can actually go more safely on an elephant through the jungle, than on a horse."},"4348":{"dur":5,"text":"But they say if you fall off a horse, you don't break as many bones as if you fall off"},"4354":{"dur":8,"text":"an elephant. So yes, the monks can go faster and deeper but if they make mistakes they"},"4362":{"dur":6,"text":"fall further than you do, which is why that if it's a bad monk who break precepts, and"},"4369":{"dur":4,"text":"unfortunately they do, then they're in big trouble. When they break the precepts, it's"},"4373":{"dur":5,"text":"much worse karma than when you do the same thing and break your precepts. They fall much"},"4379":{"dur":5,"text":"further. So, yeah there's the good thing about being a monk but there's also many dangers"},"4384":{"dur":10,"text":"as well. And we can tell the story.
