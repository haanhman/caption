I'm in the"},"6":{"dur":2,"text":"Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the"},"9":{"dur":3,"text":"University of California, San Francisco. And in this set of"},"13":{"dur":2,"text":"lectures, I'm going to talk about telomeres and"},"16":{"dur":4,"text":"telomerase. And I'll get to their implications for human"},"20":{"dur":5,"text":"health and disease. The first part of this series of three"},"26":{"dur":4,"text":"lectures is going to introduce you to the roles of telomeres"},"30":{"dur":6,"text":"and telomerase. So, let's begin by focusing in on what"},"36":{"dur":5,"text":"goes on at the very heart of a cell. Now if you looked at a"},"42":{"dur":3,"text":"cell which is just about to divide, you looked into the"},"46":{"dur":2,"text":"microscope and you stained the chromosomes, this is"},"48":{"dur":3,"text":"what you would see. Those blue, double sausage-like"},"51":{"dur":5,"text":"objects that you can see all over this microscope slide are"},"57":{"dur":2,"text":"the human chromosomes, and the DNA has just"},"59":{"dur":3,"text":"duplicated, which is why they look double. Now if you"},"63":{"dur":3,"text":"look closely, you can see red spots, two red spots at the"},"66":{"dur":4,"text":"ends of every double chromosome pair. And these red"},"71":{"dur":3,"text":"spots are a molecular probe that's lighting up the telomeric"},"75":{"dur":3,"text":"DNA that's found in common at all of the chromosome"},"78":{"dur":4,"text":"ends. And I'm going to tell you a lot about that telomeric"},"83":{"dur":7,"text":"DNA. So why are telomeres important? Their role is to cap"},"90":{"dur":5,"text":"off the ends of chromosomes. So that's a simple concept,"},"95":{"dur":2,"text":"but we can dive down into it further and think a little bit"},"98":{"dur":3,"text":"more about what that actually means. So when we think"},"102":{"dur":3,"text":"of the end of the DNA, there can be two kinds: There"},"105":{"dur":2,"text":"can be the natural end of the DNA, such as the ones we"},"108":{"dur":4,"text":"see here, the ends of the chromosomal DNA; and there"},"112":{"dur":8,"text":"can also be DNA breaks. Now, the job of a cell is to seal"},"121":{"dur":3,"text":"up any DNA breaks that happen by accident. And so a"},"125":{"dur":4,"text":"major part of this capping function, which is one of the"},"129":{"dur":4,"text":"aspects of telomere functions, is to prevent the telomeres"},"133":{"dur":3,"text":"from undergoing those very DNA transactions of very"},"137":{"dur":6,"text":"DNA reactions that are undergone by a broken DNA end."},"144":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you have a break in the DNA, it can be sutured"},"147":{"dur":4,"text":"together by, for example, recombination or just simply the"},"151":{"dur":3,"text":"two broken ends can be ligated right back together by"},"154":{"dur":5,"text":"end-to-end fusions. Also, such DNA breaks are subject to"},"160":{"dur":4,"text":"degradation.

How does it do that? The DNA sequences that you"},"178":{"dur":3,"text":"find at the ends of chromosomes, repeated over and"},"181":{"dur":4,"text":"over, are fairly similar in nature to each other. They're"},"186":{"dur":3,"text":"relatively simple sequences, and they're too simple to"},"189":{"dur":5,"text":"code for any proteins. They're not genes in the sense of"},"195":{"dur":6,"text":"coding for any proteins or RNAs. In humans for example,"},"201":{"dur":2,"text":"this repeated sequence is found up to a few thousand"},"204":{"dur":4,"text":"times, tandemly repeated over and over at the ends of the"},"209":{"dur":4,"text":"chromosomes. Another feature of the chromosomal DNAs"},"214":{"dur":3,"text":"is that, of course, unlike most of the DNA of a"},"218":{"dur":2,"text":"chromosome, which is duplex DNA, double-stranded"},"220":{"dur":4,"text":"DNA, the very end is single-stranded. And in fact the"},"224":{"dur":5,"text":"DNA strand is oriented 5' to 3', going toward the end of"},"230":{"dur":8,"text":"the chromosome. And that turns out to be important. So,"},"238":{"dur":3,"text":"we have now the telomere structure to begin with: We"},"241":{"dur":3,"text":"have again, if we blow up the end of a chromosome, we"},"245":{"dur":4,"text":"have these highly repeated sequences made up of a G-"},"250":{"dur":3,"text":"rich sequence that's the repeat unit repeated over and"},"253":{"dur":3,"text":"over again.

They bind to"},"271":{"dur":4,"text":"the telomeric repeats for the double-stranded portion, and"},"275":{"dur":3,"text":"some of them bind the single-stranded portion, and that's"},"279":{"dur":6,"text":"actually the G-rich strand that's forming the overhanging"},"285":{"dur":7,"text":"end here.

We understand a lot"},"296":{"dur":2,"text":"about the protein-DNA interactions, some of the molecular"},"299":{"dur":3,"text":"details of that.

The other way that telomeres can become"},"375":{"dur":4,"text":"dysfunctional: If for one reason or another, experimentally"},"379":{"dur":4,"text":"induced, most commonly, one of these proteins cannot"},"383":{"dur":3,"text":"bind correctly to the telomeric DNA; if its binding is"},"387":{"dur":5,"text":"disrupted through some molecular intervention or other..."},"392":{"dur":7,"text":"in both cases, cells sense and respond to this state of"},"400":{"dur":6,"text":"telomere dysfunction. Now indeed, cells have a lot of very"},"406":{"dur":6,"text":"strict regulatory reactions to the lack of proper telomeric"},"413":{"dur":6,"text":"DNA.

If by chance the"},"440":{"dur":6,"text":"cell does continue to multiply, now those telomeres"},"446":{"dur":5,"text":"become subject to the very kinds of fusions (the DNA-"},"451":{"dur":3,"text":"joining events that I told you telomeres shouldn't allow to"},"455":{"dur":4,"text":"happen), and that can lead to genomic instability,"},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"because the end-to-end joining of telomeres to"},"462":{"dur":4,"text":"themselves (other telomeres, that is) or to broken DNAs,"},"467":{"dur":5,"text":"that can cause the chromosomes, which fuse to each"},"472":{"dur":4,"text":"other, to tear themselves apart as the cells divide, leading"},"476":{"dur":6,"text":"to genomic instability.

So what's"},"573":{"dur":7,"text":"the issue here? Well, the mechanism of DNA replication,"},"580":{"dur":4,"text":"the machinery of DNA replication, has a particular quirk to"},"584":{"dur":4,"text":"it. It's very good at faithfully copying almost all the way"},"589":{"dur":3,"text":"along the length of the chromosomal DNA (or any linear"},"593":{"dur":5,"text":"DNA), but the make-up of the DNA replication machinery"},"599":{"dur":5,"text":"is such that is cannot copy the very, very end of the linear"},"604":{"dur":5,"text":"DNA, such as a eukaryotic chromosomal DNA.

And let me give you some examples of such"},"795":{"dur":6,"text":"puzzling observations. Well, the first one was that in the"},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena, which has a lot of very"},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"small mini-chromosomes and is therefore amenable to"},"808":{"dur":3,"text":"molecular analyses of its telomeric DNA by direct"},"811":{"dur":4,"text":"methods, the telomeric repeat sequences (remember I told"},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"you about the repeated sequences repeated over and"},"818":{"dur":3,"text":"over at the ends of chromosomes)... the repeat sequence"},"821":{"dur":6,"text":"in this organism, G4T2 repeats, were heterogeneous in"},"828":{"dur":4,"text":"their number, in different molecules in a population of"},"833":{"dur":4,"text":"otherwise homogeneous cells.

So"},"858":{"dur":2,"text":"that was very surprising, because if you look across at the"},"861":{"dur":4,"text":"internal region of a DNA, such as a chromosomal DNA, if"},"865":{"dur":3,"text":"you look at one cell compared with another in a"},"869":{"dur":3,"text":"population of cells from, say, one organism, it should"},"872":{"dur":3,"text":"always be an identical sequence.

Another interesting"},"1439":{"dur":3,"text":"clue came when we looked in more detail at different"},"1442":{"dur":7,"text":"oligonucleotides that could act as primers. Now, we had"},"1450":{"dur":3,"text":"found, as I said to you, that when you put Tetrahymena"},"1453":{"dur":4,"text":"telomeric repeats into yeast cells, live cells, then yeast"},"1458":{"dur":4,"text":"repeats were added somehow, it was unknown then, to"},"1462":{"dur":4,"text":"the Tetrahymena telomeres. And the yeast repeats have"},"1467":{"dur":1,"text":"a different sequence, and I've shown you a little segment"},"1469":{"dur":5,"text":"of it. It's T, G, sometimes one G, sometimes two,"},"1474":{"dur":4,"text":"sometimes three Gs. So we wondered if the converse"},"1478":{"dur":4,"text":"would be the case; if we added a yeast primer to a"},"1483":{"dur":4,"text":"Tetrahymena extract, now in vitro, would we see"},"1488":{"dur":4,"text":"Tetrahymena sequences added to the yeast telomeric"},"1492":{"dur":6,"text":"oligonucleotide. And indeed, we did see such addition."},"1498":{"dur":3,"text":"And again, large numbers of repeats could be added to"},"1502":{"dur":6,"text":"such a primer quite efficiently. Now we also noticed"},"1508":{"dur":4,"text":"another interesting thing about the reaction. When we"},"1512":{"dur":4,"text":"had a primer that ended with four Gs, what we found was"},"1517":{"dur":2,"text":"that first two Ts were added, and then four Gs, two Ts,"},"1520":{"dur":2,"text":"and so on. When we had a primer that ended with three"},"1523":{"dur":4,"text":"Gs, first a G was added, and then the two Ts, in other"},"1527":{"dur":3,"text":"words completing this run of four Gs. And I haven't shown"},"1530":{"dur":4,"text":"it, but if you had a primer that ended in two Gs, then GG,"},"1535":{"dur":4,"text":"and then TT. So this suggested that perhaps something"},"1539":{"dur":7,"text":"was aligning this very first portion, the portion of the"},"1546":{"dur":3,"text":"reaction that's taking place, adding to the very 3' end of"},"1550":{"dur":3,"text":"the primer, that perhaps something was aligning this, in"},"1553":{"dur":4,"text":"the enzyme somehow. Because in other words, if you"},"1558":{"dur":2,"text":"lined it up like this, then everything was lined up. What"},"1561":{"dur":3,"text":"could be doing this? So was there something that aligned"},"1564":{"dur":5,"text":"the product-forming part of this enzyme? Remember this"},"1570":{"dur":4,"text":"was very mysterious at the time. So in fact we looked and"},"1575":{"dur":4,"text":"found that, indeed, as I said, you had four Gs, and you"},"1579":{"dur":3,"text":"added two Ts. If you had three Gs, one G was added."},"1583":{"dur":2,"text":"Two Gs, and you'd have two Gs added, and then the two"},"1585":{"dur":3,"text":"Ts. And if you had one G, then it would be three Gs, and"},"1589":{"dur":2,"text":"then the two Ts. So in fact, there was something that was"},"1591":{"dur":4,"text":"aligning how the next repeats were added, dependent on"},"1596":{"dur":7,"text":"the 3' end of the primer. The result of all of this kind of"},"1604":{"dur":3,"text":"analysis led us to the idea that there was in fact a"},"1607":{"dur":4,"text":"template within the telomerase, and to our surprise, this"},"1612":{"dur":4,"text":"template turned out to be made of RNA, an RNA that is"},"1616":{"dur":4,"text":"actually built in to the telomerase complex. And this"},"1621":{"dur":4,"text":"template is a short portion of this RNA, which otherwise"},"1625":{"dur":3,"text":"has a lot of other structure which is built into the enzyme"},"1629":{"dur":5,"text":"particle, which contains also a protein, which is called"},"1635":{"dur":4,"text":"TERT. So what telomerase does is it takes that single-"},"1640":{"dur":6,"text":"stranded G-rich strand, it aligns the 3' end nucleotides by"},"1647":{"dur":4,"text":"Watson-Crick base pairing onto the template sequence,"},"1651":{"dur":3,"text":"so here's the example where we have two Gs at the end"},"1655":{"dur":4,"text":"of the primer. It aligns it on this part of the sequence, and"},"1659":{"dur":5,"text":"then it polymerizes, one at a time, each of these"},"1664":{"dur":8,"text":"nucleotides onto the DNA end, extending the DNA end"},"1673":{"dur":5,"text":"by copying this template. And so now, you end up with"},"1678":{"dur":7,"text":"longer DNA. So telomerase is a unique polymerase, it's a"},"1686":{"dur":5,"text":"reverse transcriptase by the definition, that is, copies RNA"},"1692":{"dur":7,"text":"into DNA. It's unique because the RNA component is"},"1700":{"dur":4,"text":"actually intrinsically built into the telomerase ribonucleoprotein"},"1704":{"dur":4,"text":"particle. It has to be built in for that"},"1709":{"dur":4,"text":"templating to take place. And indeed the enzyme is truly a"},"1714":{"dur":5,"text":"ribonucleoprotein enzyme, we believe. And unlike, for"},"1719":{"dur":3,"text":"example, the reverse transcriptases that copy, say, the"},"1723":{"dur":4,"text":"HIV viral genome, which is a genome thousands of"},"1727":{"dur":3,"text":"nucleotides long, a very complicated sequence which"},"1731":{"dur":5,"text":"encodes proteins, this enzyme copies very short"},"1736":{"dur":4,"text":"sequences over and over again. And it does it by this"},"1740":{"dur":7,"text":"process of aligning the DNA end on the template, and so"},"1748":{"dur":3,"text":"just to complete the thought here, here's the template. If"},"1751":{"dur":3,"text":"we polymerize all these together onto the DNA end, now"},"1755":{"dur":4,"text":"you'll have a new DNA end that ends with TTG, and that"},"1759":{"dur":4,"text":"will realign in the next round back in this AAC, for another"},"1764":{"dur":3,"text":"round of synthesis, and this can go on in the test tube for"},"1768":{"dur":4,"text":"many repeats. I've told you about some of the enzymatic"},"1772":{"dur":4,"text":"properties of telomerase, but what good is telomerase for"},"1777":{"dur":5,"text":"cells? Well, the answer came by manipulating telomerase"},"1782":{"dur":3,"text":"in Tetrahymena, the organism in which it was first"},"1786":{"dur":6,"text":"discovered. So if you remember, telomerase is adding"},"1792":{"dur":6,"text":"telomeric DNA to the ends of chromosomes, and so the"},"1799":{"dur":3,"text":"question was: What happened if it couldn't do that? So"},"1803":{"dur":3,"text":"we looked in Tetrahymena, which, as I said, was a good"},"1807":{"dur":3,"text":"source of telomerase, and another feature of these"},"1810":{"dur":3,"text":"organisms that I didn't tell you was that, if you grow them"},"1814":{"dur":3,"text":"in culture in the laboratory, they're effectively immortal, so"},"1817":{"dur":2,"text":"long as you keep them fed and under good conditions,"},"1820":{"dur":2,"text":"they can just propagate and propagate and propagate,"},"1822":{"dur":6,"text":"seemingly forever. And they have plenty of telomerase."},"1829":{"dur":3,"text":"We manipulated the telomerase RNA. Now, we made"},"1833":{"dur":3,"text":"some changes in the RNA, and I won't go into the details"},"1836":{"dur":5,"text":"of it, but the effect of such small changes in the RNA I've"},"1842":{"dur":4,"text":"shown diagrammatically here. The telomeric DNA repeat"},"1846":{"dur":4,"text":"sequences, which as I said consist of multiple repeats at"},"1851":{"dur":4,"text":"the ends of chromosomes normally, as the cells went"},"1856":{"dur":2,"text":"through cell divisions, the telomeres progressively got"},"1859":{"dur":3,"text":"shorter and shorter, and after about 20 or 25 cell"},"1862":{"dur":4,"text":"divisions, the cells ceased to divide. So in other words,"},"1867":{"dur":4,"text":"when we inactivated telomerase, over the succeeding"},"1871":{"dur":4,"text":"cell divisions the telomeres progressively shortened, so in"},"1875":{"dur":3,"text":"effect when the cells ceased dividing, they'd become"},"1879":{"dur":4,"text":"mortal. From being immortal, they'd become mortal. And all"},"1883":{"dur":5,"text":"we had done was to inactivate telomerase by this small"},"1888":{"dur":3,"text":"change, so like a little stiletto stuck at the heart of"},"1891":{"dur":3,"text":"telomerase, we killed the enzyme very surgically, and we"},"1895":{"dur":5,"text":"were able to make immortal cells become mortal. So, the"},"1900":{"dur":3,"text":"conclusion is that the telomerase maintains the ends of"},"1903":{"dur":3,"text":"chromosomes. Telomeres are replenished by telomerase"},"1907":{"dur":4,"text":"as they keep dividing. And in fact, that continuing"},"1911":{"dur":3,"text":"replenishment, even in the face of the continuing"},"1915":{"dur":3,"text":"shortening processes that take place, can compensate"},"1918":{"dur":2,"text":"for those shortening processes and allow the cells to"},"1921":{"dur":4,"text":"keep on dividing. So that's what telomerase does for"},"1925":{"dur":4,"text":"cells. And that's the important message: Telomeres are"},"1930":{"dur":5,"text":"replenished by telomerase. Now, let's go into a more"},"1936":{"dur":4,"text":"detailed experiment in yeast cells. If we look at a culture"},"1940":{"dur":3,"text":"of yeast cells and we plate them out on a plate in a"},"1944":{"dur":4,"text":"laboratory... all those little white spots are cells that have"},"1948":{"dur":2,"text":"grown up from individual cells distributed on the plate,"},"1950":{"dur":2,"text":"they've been distributed on kind of a V-shape pattern"},"1952":{"dur":4,"text":"here, a triangular pattern. So, the cells are growing well"},"1957":{"dur":3,"text":"normally. Now if we delete one of the genes for"},"1960":{"dur":3,"text":"telomerase, either the RNA structural gene or the protein"},"1963":{"dur":4,"text":"structural gene for the core of the enzyme, now just as I"},"1968":{"dur":5,"text":"described for you in Tetrahymena, the cells divide and"},"1974":{"dur":2,"text":"divide, and the telomeres progressively get shorter and"},"1977":{"dur":2,"text":"shorter, until they get to a point where most of the cells"},"1980":{"dur":4,"text":"completely cease to divide. And so now they're no longer"},"1984":{"dur":5,"text":"capable of producing a rich growth of colonies on such a"},"1989":{"dur":3,"text":"plate. See, there's very little growth here. And we call that"},"1993":{"dur":3,"text":"senescence. So taking away telomerase is a bit of a"},"1997":{"dur":2,"text":"delay as the cells go through about 50 or so cell"},"2000":{"dur":3,"text":"generations, 50 to 80, and then the cells' telomeres get"},"2004":{"dur":3,"text":"too short, and they undergo senescence. We've"},"2007":{"dur":3,"text":"scrutinized more closely what happens to cells at this"},"2011":{"dur":10,"text":"point. Interestingly, a few cells do survive, and in fact,"},"2022":{"dur":4,"text":"those cells eventually become quite capable of producing"},"2026":{"dur":4,"text":"good growth on a plate, but they're different. These cells"},"2031":{"dur":3,"text":"now have very heterogeneous and long telomeres. I'll"},"2035":{"dur":6,"text":"show you these in a more graphical form in a moment. A"},"2041":{"dur":4,"text":"gene required for this to happen, for such \"survivors,\" as"},"2046":{"dur":7,"text":"we call them, to appear, is the gene RAD52. For at least"},"2053":{"dur":4,"text":"one of these pathways, the RAD50 gene is also required."},"2057":{"dur":4,"text":"What are RAD52 and RAD50? These are in the"},"2062":{"dur":4,"text":"homologous recombination pathway. They're needed for"},"2067":{"dur":3,"text":"recombination and therefore, to get survivors required"},"2070":{"dur":4,"text":"recombination. Similar phenomena have been seen in"},"2075":{"dur":2,"text":"mammalian cells. They've been less well characterized"},"2078":{"dur":4,"text":"genetically, but similar survivor cells have been seen, and"},"2082":{"dur":4,"text":"they're called ALT cells in mammals, for \"alternative"},"2087":{"dur":6,"text":"lengthening of telomeres\"... ALT cells. So, without"},"2094":{"dur":3,"text":"telomerase, most cells go through senescence, but rare"},"2097":{"dur":6,"text":"cells can survive. So, that is another way that"},"2104":{"dur":5,"text":"chromosomes can survive, but interestingly enough, ALT"},"2110":{"dur":6,"text":"is not normally seen in most normal cells. Now we"},"2116":{"dur":3,"text":"wondered why, because on the face of it, it looks as if"},"2120":{"dur":4,"text":"these cells are growing perfectly well. Although if you look"},"2124":{"dur":2,"text":"more closely, you will see that some of the cells are not"},"2127":{"dur":3,"text":"living well, but the great majority can survive with these"},"2130":{"dur":3,"text":"very long telomeres, that they can keep recombining, and"},"2134":{"dur":3,"text":"keep the population up that way. We asked what's"},"2138":{"dur":5,"text":"different. So first of all, we quantified very carefully the cell"},"2143":{"dur":3,"text":"growth, so this is just one way of showing it. The colony-"},"2146":{"dur":4,"text":"forming units, which is a measure of viability, as the cells"},"2151":{"dur":2,"text":"went through the progression of shortening telomeres,"},"2154":{"dur":1,"text":"getting to this point when they get to senescence, and"},"2156":{"dur":4,"text":"then those rare survivors now overgrew, and now you"},"2160":{"dur":2,"text":"can see them taking over and becoming the population."},"2163":{"dur":3,"text":"So they're growing again quite well. And we looked at the"},"2167":{"dur":3,"text":"gene expression profile in such cells. First of all we looked"},"2171":{"dur":3,"text":"at the telomeres, just to make sure that the telomeres"},"2174":{"dur":3,"text":"were doing what I showed you diagrammatically before,"},"2177":{"dur":2,"text":"yes they are, so here's the telomeres. And this is what's"},"2180":{"dur":2,"text":"called a Southern blot, where we're probing with a"},"2183":{"dur":3,"text":"telomeric DNA sequence. And the most important are"},"2186":{"dur":2,"text":"these bands down here, that's the easiest to look at"},"2188":{"dur":2,"text":"initially, because this is a lot of the telomeres. You can"},"2191":{"dur":2,"text":"see they're of a certain length, and as they get shorter"},"2194":{"dur":2,"text":"they run faster and faster in the gel, so you can see"},"2197":{"dur":2,"text":"they're getting shorter and shorter with these successive"},"2199":{"dur":4,"text":"days of passaging of cell divisions without any telomerase"},"2204":{"dur":4,"text":"present. Now, there are very few cells here actually, but"},"2209":{"dur":3,"text":"we loaded enough DNA so you can see what little"},"2212":{"dur":2,"text":"telomeric DNA there is. And then the cells start growing"},"2215":{"dur":2,"text":"well again, and what you see is now the telomeres, the"},"2217":{"dur":2,"text":"pattern has changed, they're very heterogeneous, and"},"2220":{"dur":2,"text":"there's much longer telomeres, you can see they're longer"},"2223":{"dur":10,"text":"than these ones here. So that's the telomeric profile. Now,"},"2233":{"dur":4,"text":"let's look at the gene expression profile. This is what's"},"2238":{"dur":4,"text":"called a microarray experiment, and in this experiment,"},"2242":{"dur":3,"text":"one compares the pattern of gene expression by looking"},"2246":{"dur":3,"text":"at the messenger RNA levels for all of the genes in the"},"2250":{"dur":4,"text":"genome. And one asks, does a particular gene,"},"2254":{"dur":2,"text":"compared with a reference, which is right at the"},"2256":{"dur":2,"text":"beginning, when everything is growing well, does a"},"2258":{"dur":3,"text":"particular gene's level of expression become higher or"},"2262":{"dur":4,"text":"lower. If it becomes lower, it gets greener and greener."},"2266":{"dur":11,"text":"And so each of these going across is a time point, each"},"2277":{"dur":3,"text":"line in the column represent a single gene, and each of"},"2281":{"dur":7,"text":"these horizontal areas represents the day at which the"},"2288":{"dur":3,"text":"RNA was taken out of the cells and analyzed in this way."},"2291":{"dur":2,"text":"And so what we find, and it's all compressed and you just"},"2294":{"dur":4,"text":"need to look at the pattern, was that about 650 genes"},"2299":{"dur":4,"text":"changed their expression, and they got either lower levels"},"2303":{"dur":3,"text":"of expression (and we'll talk about this in more detail, and"},"2307":{"dur":3,"text":"that's shown in the green) or higher levels of expression"},"2311":{"dur":4,"text":"(and that shows up as red). Now right away what you can"},"2315":{"dur":2,"text":"see is that the maximum changes occurred right when the"},"2318":{"dur":5,"text":"cells were approaching and into senescence. Six-"},"2323":{"dur":4,"text":"hundred and fifty genes is something like 10% of the"},"2328":{"dur":4,"text":"genes in the genome, which is about 6000 to 7000"},"2332":{"dur":5,"text":"genes. So about 10% of the genome shows a change in"},"2338":{"dur":5,"text":"expression, particularly at senescence, but also, as I'll"},"2343":{"dur":4,"text":"show you, some genes remain changed even when the"},"2348":{"dur":3,"text":"cells are growing well, maintaining their telomeres through"},"2351":{"dur":5,"text":"this recombination mechanism. So one can analyze all the"},"2357":{"dur":3,"text":"patterns of genes whose expression has changed and"},"2361":{"dur":3,"text":"compare them with known patterns of gene expression"},"2364":{"dur":3,"text":"changes that have been looked at in a variety of"},"2368":{"dur":5,"text":"experimental settings by the many people in the yeast"},"2373":{"dur":3,"text":"genomics and gene expression community, who've"},"2376":{"dur":2,"text":"looked at gene expression changes. So one can"},"2378":{"dur":3,"text":"compare what we see here with what's been seen in"},"2382":{"dur":3,"text":"other experiments done by many other groups looking at"},"2386":{"dur":7,"text":"many other conditions of changes to the cells in yeast. So"},"2393":{"dur":3,"text":"what we found was that in fact, this pattern we observed"},"2397":{"dur":3,"text":"was unique, and we gave it a name: the telomerase"},"2400":{"dur":4,"text":"deletion response, the TDR. Now we found a set of"},"2405":{"dur":4,"text":"genes uniquely upregulated in response to the deletion of"},"2409":{"dur":2,"text":"telomerase RNA, and we called that the \"telomerase"},"2412":{"dur":3,"text":"deletion signature.\" It was a particular group that"},"2415":{"dur":2,"text":"behaved as a group only when you deleted the"},"2417":{"dur":3,"text":"telomerase RNA, so that would be a group of those that"},"2420":{"dur":3,"text":"showed up as red, because they were upregulated. And"},"2424":{"dur":3,"text":"that hadn't been seen by any other manipulation. So the"},"2427":{"dur":2,"text":"cells indeed were sensing that they were losing"},"2430":{"dur":3,"text":"telomerase, and they responded in a particular way, by"},"2434":{"dur":2,"text":"changing their physiology, which we read out as a"},"2436":{"dur":5,"text":"change in gene expression profile. Right at the stage of"},"2441":{"dur":2,"text":"senescence, when I showed you that there were a lot of"},"2444":{"dur":3,"text":"genes that particularly were turned up or down in their"},"2448":{"dur":5,"text":"activity, there was a particular known DNA damage"},"2454":{"dur":3,"text":"response profile that was very prominent. That actually"},"2457":{"dur":2,"text":"makes a lot of sense. If you remember, I told you that,"},"2460":{"dur":3,"text":"when telomeres become short, they will become prone to"},"2464":{"dur":3,"text":"fusions, and now when they fuse, then chromosomes will"},"2467":{"dur":4,"text":"get ripped apart as they try to go through the ensuing cell"},"2471":{"dur":3,"text":"divisions, because the chromosomes with fused telomeres"},"2474":{"dur":2,"text":"will now have two centromeres that will pull apart in"},"2477":{"dur":3,"text":"mitosis, breaking the chromosomes at random positions,"},"2481":{"dur":2,"text":"and causing essentially genomic havoc, which can"},"2483":{"dur":4,"text":"quickly lead to cell death if the cells try to keep dividing."},"2488":{"dur":3,"text":"And there's a damage response that takes place when"},"2491":{"dur":3,"text":"DNA breaks appear, and this is what we see, so this"},"2494":{"dur":2,"text":"makes very good sense. At senescence, we see a"},"2497":{"dur":3,"text":"damage response. What was very intriguing was that we"},"2501":{"dur":1,"text":"also saw others things.

Very"},"2533":{"dur":6,"text":"intriguing observations, not expected. Now, the survivors"},"2540":{"dur":2,"text":"were fascinating because, even though I showed you"},"2542":{"dur":3,"text":"they appear to grow quite well, they had a gene"},"2546":{"dur":3,"text":"expression transcriptional profile which was distinct from"},"2549":{"dur":5,"text":"the wild-type cells. And what persisted was a subset of"},"2554":{"dur":4,"text":"the environmental stress response genes that stayed on,"},"2559":{"dur":2,"text":"so what's interesting is that those cells, which appear to"},"2562":{"dur":3,"text":"be growing well on the surface, \"stoics,\" they're really"},"2565":{"dur":3,"text":"hurting; their physiology is different, and they sense"},"2569":{"dur":3,"text":"themselves as being under what they sense as a cellular"},"2573":{"dur":4,"text":"stress. So, you can have cells that grow well without"},"2578":{"dur":3,"text":"telomerase, but if you look at the cells, these cells are"},"2582":{"dur":3,"text":"behaving as though under an environmental stress, and"},"2585":{"dur":3,"text":"so they indicate by their gene expression profiles a cellular"},"2589":{"dur":5,"text":"stress response.

So, what we learned"},"2618":{"dur":3,"text":"then is that yeast lacking telomerase, using recombination"},"2622":{"dur":3,"text":"to maintain telomeres, do grow well, but they're under"},"2625":{"dur":3,"text":"continuing cellular stress, and this is what these gene"},"2628":{"dur":6,"text":"expression profile analyses showed us.
