been going up since 2009."},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"They have increased\nover the last two years,"},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"and they may increase this year as well."},"454":{"dur":3,"text":"And German

look at last year."},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"One of the things that really quickly\ncan reduce emissions"},"475":{"dur":1,"text":"is switching from coal to natural gas"},"476":{"dur":3,"text":"because natural gas is about\nhalf of the carbon intensity of coal,"},"480":{"dur":1,"text":"and that would have resulted"},"481":{"dur":3,"text":"in a pretty significant reduction\nin German carbon emissions last year,"},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"except for the fact that Germany\ntook offline nuclear,"},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"and when it did that,"},"490":{"dur":3,"text":"it meant that the emissions\nactually ended up going up again."},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, there's some questions\nabout what about the future?"},"496":{"dur":4,"text":"So if we just do more solar and wind,\nwon't it

all,"},"507":{"dur":3,"text":"he is an energy analyst\nand economist namely on [inaudible],"},"510":{"dur":3,"text":"and what he finds is that\nthat problem I described earlier,"},"514":{"dur":1,"text":"where sometimes you have too much wind"},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"at certain parts of the day\nor of the year,"},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"or too much solar\nand it's not clear what to do with it,"},"520":{"dur":3,"text":"that that reduces the economic value\nof wind and solar."},"524":{"dur":1,"text":"So wind, actually,"},"525":{"dur":4,"text":"the value of it reduces 40% once it gets\nto be 30% of your electricity,"},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"and solar, it's even more dramatic,"},"532":{"dur":3,"text":"it actually declines by half\nwhen it gets to just 15%."},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"So one of the things you hear, though,"},"538":{"dur":3,"text":"is that we can do\na solar roof really fast."},"542":{"dur":1,"text":"Solar is fast,"},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"you just put it up in one day\nand you've installed the thing;"},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"whereas it takes 10 years or 5 years,\ndepending on where you are,"},"549":{"dur":1,"text":"to build a nuclear plant."},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"And so it makes sense you'd think,"},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"if we do solar-wind,\nyou can just go a lot faster."},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"But this was actually studied"},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"in an important article\nfor the journal Science last year."},"560":{"dur":4,"text":"One of the authors was
