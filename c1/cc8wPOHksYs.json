I"},"660":{"dur":5,"text":"was done at the reality that God deals differently\nwith people when people deal differently with"},"666":{"dur":6,"text":"God.

Here's what I think is remarkable"},"781":{"dur":5,"text":"about this pastor that I've not met, but you've pictured here for me. Is it seems to me,"},"787":{"dur":6,"text":"the way that you put this, your time over there\nwas not a sparring match over Romans one every"},"794":{"dur":6,"text":"night.
