obviously,\neverybody has read and heard"},"35":{"dur":0,"text":"a lot about it."},"36":{"dur":3,"text":"Because to actually see it in\naction is wonderful for me."},"39":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm going to talk a little bit\nabout the Mars sample return"},"43":{"dur":1,"text":"mission."},"44":{"dur":2,"text":"It's an idea that we've had\nat NASA for quite some time."},"46":{"dur":3,"text":"And we're

Apollo\nwith no astronauts."},"80":{"dur":2,"text":"It even includes, you know,\ngoing to another planet,"},"83":{"dur":2,"text":"landing, doing some stuff\nthere, launching into orbit"},"85":{"dur":2,"text":"around that planet,\nand coming back."},"87":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's very analogous to what\nwe did at the Moon with Apollo."},"90":{"dur":3,"text":"But there's no

Mary will give me\na cue to wrap it up."},"107":{"dur":4,"text":"And then we can have a little\nbit of interaction on Q&A."},"111":{"dur":2,"text":"And I also understand\nthere's a number of

we"},"142":{"dur":1,"text":"can talk about the cool stuff."},"144":{"dur":2,"text":"And I have a number of videos\nthat I want to show you."},"146":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'm going to--"},"147":{"dur":2,"text":"in order for me to talk\ncomprehensively about MSR,"},"150":{"dur":2,"text":"it takes about four hours."},"152":{"dur":1,"text":"And so we only\nhave less than

preparing\nfor humans to go to Mars."},"195":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll touch on that peripherally\nat the end of the presentation."},"198":{"dur":2,"text":"But most of my talk is about\ndoing this with rovers,"},"201":{"dur":1,"text":"and orbiters, and so forth."},"202":{"dur":3,"text":"So talk a little bit about\nthe context for exploration."},"206":{"dur":1,"text":"What is it that we're\ntrying to accomplish"},"207":{"dur":2,"text":"as a blend of\nscience, technology,"},"209":{"dur":2,"text":"and inspiration, which I\nthink is a product that we,"},"212":{"dur":3,"text":"at NASA sometimes don't\nappreciate how much we're"},"215":{"dur":1,"text":"delivering that along\nwith delivering science"},"217":{"dur":0,"text":"and technology?"},"218":{"dur":3,"text":"Talk a little bit about this\nMars sample return mission."},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, talk about some\nof the key technologies that"},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"include things like how we get\nthe samples off the

Earth."},"233":{"dur":1,"text":"And I want to talk\nabout, in particular,"},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"a really cool application\nfor superconductors"},"237":{"dur":4,"text":"to assist us in the trapping of\nthis basketball in Mars orbit."},"242":{"dur":1,"text":"It's called flux pinning."},"243":{"dur":1,"text":"And then I want to\ntalk a little bit"},"245":{"dur":2,"text":"about the fact that\nthe Mars samples,"},"247":{"dur":1,"text":"we have a love-hate\nrelationship with them."},"249":{"dur":2,"text":"They're our frenemy, I guess."},"251":{"dur":1,"text":"We want to study them."},"252":{"dur":1,"text":"We want to bring\nthem back to Earth"},"254":{"dur":1,"text":"and study in our laboratories."},"255":{"dur":4,"text":"But we also have to\naccount for the possibility"},"260":{"dur":2,"text":"that there might be biological\nactivity in those samples."},"263":{"dur":1,"text":"And therefore, we\nneed to treat them"},"264":{"dur":2,"text":"as if they're

love-hate\nrelationship with the sample"},"274":{"dur":2,"text":"actually drives the\nengineering of the mission."},"277":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'll talk more about that."},"279":{"dur":1,"text":"And then at the end,\nif we do have any time,"},"281":{"dur":1,"text":"we'll talk about some\nof the longer-term stuff"},"283":{"dur":4,"text":"like flying helicopters at\nMars, and landing on a pinpoint,"},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"whereas right now, we land\nwith miles of uncertainty"},"289":{"dur":1,"text":"of where we land, et cetera."},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's kind of the outline."},"294":{"dur":2,"text":"So let me talk a little\nbit about context."},"296":{"dur":1,"text":"And I won't go through\nthis point by point."},"298":{"dur":3,"text":"But I just wanted to\nmake the point that we--"},"302":{"dur":3,"text":"within NASA, there are sort\nof four major organizations"},"305":{"dur":3,"text":"that are responsible\nfor the NASA missions."},"308":{"dur":1,"text":"There's one that's\nresponsible for Aeronautics."},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"So one of A's in NASA\nstands for \"Aeronautics,\""},"312":{"dur":1,"text":"even though I think NASA\nis much better known"},"314":{"dur":1,"text":"for the space side."},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"Within the Space domain, we\nhave the human exploration"},"318":{"dur":0,"text":"and operations."},"319":{"dur":3,"text":"Those are the guys who operate\nthe International Space Station"},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"and are preparing to\nsend humans to Mars."},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"There is a Space Technology\nMission Directorate,"},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"which, as the name implies,\nis responsible for developing"},"330":{"dur":1,"text":"new technologies\nthat can be applied"},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"across the board\nat NASA and beyond."},"333":{"dur":1,"text":"And then, there's what we\ncall the Science Mission"},"335":{"dur":1,"text":"And the Science\nMission

seeing\nfrom the Mars rovers."},"343":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's the\nmission directorate"},"345":{"dur":3,"text":"that operates the\nNASA Mars missions."},"349":{"dur":4,"text":"So we have countless journal\narticles, and papers,"},"354":{"dur":2,"text":"and covers of \"Nature\"\nmagazine, and so forth"},"357":{"dur":3,"text":"that have resulted from\nthe exploration of Mars."},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we've delivered\na really wide variety"},"362":{"dur":0,"text":"of key science findings."},"363":{"dur":3,"text":"Like, before the Mars\nExploration Program began,"},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"we didn't really know how\npervasive water was at Mars."},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"And it turns out that water\nhas been extremely pervasive"},"371":{"dur":1,"text":"at Mars."},"372":{"dur":3,"text":"In the ancient times,\nit was wet, and warm,"},"376":{"dur":4,"text":"and much more habitable for\nthe kind of life that we"},"380":{"dur":1,"text":"are familiar with on Earth."},"381":{"dur":1,"text":"And then something happened."},"382":{"dur":1,"text":"And all that water went away."},"384":{"dur":3,"text":"And Mars is now this\ndry, cold desert."},"387":{"dur":4,"text":"And because Earth and Mars\nare kind of brother and sister"},"391":{"dur":3,"text":"in the planetary family,\nit would be really nice"},"395":{"dur":3,"text":"for us to understand what\nhappened to all of that water"},"398":{"dur":1,"text":"Why did it escape?"},"400":{"dur":1,"text":"And if you're\nselfish and you don't"},"402":{"dur":1,"text":"want it to happen\nto you on Earth,"},"403":{"dur":4,"text":"or maybe your grandchildren's\ngrandchildren's grandchildren"},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"downstream, it would be really\nnice to understand that."},"410":{"dur":4,"text":"So science is a big\naspect of what we do."},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"Engineering and\ntechnology development"},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"is another big aspect of what\nthe Mars program delivers"},"419":{"dur":3,"text":"back to not only NASA but\nto the world at large."},"422":{"dur":4,"text":"Many of the autonomous systems\nthat are now being implemented"},"427":{"dur":1,"text":"in driverless cars\ngot their start"},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"as NASA tried to figure\nout how to operate rovers"},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"on the surface of another\nplanet where we couldn't"},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"have direct human intervention."},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"And Terry is one of the\nworld's experts in that field."},"437":{"dur":3,"text":"And I hope, one day, he mans\nup, and comes, and gives a talk"},"441":{"dur":3,"text":"here at Google on all the cool\nstuff that he's been working on"},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"with his colleagues at Ames."},"447":{"dur":3,"text":"That's a-- sorry for a\nlittle internal joke."},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"Anyway, we're developing a\nwhole variety of technologies"},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"that not only serve\nsort of a localized NASA"},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"interest like landing\nmore stuff on Mars,"},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"which is a very\nspecialized application,"},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"but things that help\nthe world at large."},"462":{"dur":1,"text":"And then, the last one--"},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"and like I said, some of\nmy colleagues at NASA,"},"466":{"dur":1,"text":"they want to talk\nabout the science."},"467":{"dur":1,"text":"And they want to talk\nabout the technology"},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"as it applies to missions."},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"But I think that one of\nour greatest products"},"472":{"dur":1,"text":"is inspiration."},"474":{"dur":4,"text":"And for me, it is unbelievable\nto be at JPL the night"},"478":{"dur":3,"text":"that we landed Curiosity and\nto see that in Times Square."},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"Times Square was lit\nup with the images that"},"484":{"dur":1,"text":"were coming back from Mars."},"485":{"dur":1,"text":"And when those first--"},"487":{"dur":3,"text":"the landing itself was sort of\na technological achievement."},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"But when those first\nthumbnail images came back"},"492":{"dur":3,"text":"and we knew we were safe on\nMars, there was a human story."},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"That was the story of\nall the people who,"},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"through their lives-- and you\nguys know what this is like,"},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"to work long hours,\nnights, weekends,"},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"and feel personally\nresponsible for the success--"},"504":{"dur":3,"text":"in our case, missions-- in your\ncase, products or something"},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"that Google is\ntrying to develop."},"509":{"dur":1,"text":"But that notion that\nyou've invested yourself"},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"personally in\nsomething, no machine"},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"can ever, ever take away\nthat human inspiration."},"517":{"dur":4,"text":"So I think that's one of the\nmajor products that we deliver."},"521":{"dur":1,"text":"Coming back to\nscience, there's kind"},"523":{"dur":3,"text":"of four things that organize our\nscientific exploration of Mars."},"526":{"dur":1,"text":"Number one-- and\nyou know, these are"},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"written as if they're equals,\nbut they're actually not."},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"Finding life is the big one."},"533":{"dur":1,"text":"It's the first among equals."},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"That's the one that--\nyou know, if we"},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"were to find life, even\nmicrobial life, either evidence"},"540":{"dur":1,"text":"of it in the ancient\nhistory of Mars"},"542":{"dur":5,"text":"in a kind of fossilized\ncontext, or extant life, that"},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"would be just an unbelievable\nchange in the way in which"},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"people on Earth\nthink of themselves"},"552":{"dur":5,"text":"and think of us as not being\nalone in this universe."},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"Not to be downplayed\nare the other goals."},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"Like you know, I\ntalked a little bit"},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"about the processes and the\nhistory of the climate on Mars."},"565":{"dur":3,"text":"So even if you could care less\nabout this ethereal discussion"},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"about whether or not there's\nlife on another planet,"},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"maybe if you're a little more\nself-centered or thinking"},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"about the future for\nyour kids, and kids,"},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"and kids, this notion\nof, let's not let"},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"happen to Earth what\nhappened to Mars."},"581":{"dur":4,"text":"Understanding how the surface\nof Mars evolved and the interior"},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"of Mars, that is actually\nvastly different from Earth's."},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"And one advantage that\nwe have, the Earth"},"591":{"dur":1,"text":"is constantly\nreinventing itself."},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"The Earth's-- we have these\nplates, these tectonic plates,"},"596":{"dur":1,"text":"that keep moving around\nand changing things."},"598":{"dur":4,"text":"And there's constant upwellings\nin the ocean and on land."},"602":{"dur":1,"text":"And things get recycled."},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"So something that's been\non the surface of the Earth"},"605":{"dur":1,"text":"a million years ago is\nalmost certainly not"},"607":{"dur":1,"text":"on the surface of\nthe Earth anymore."},"609":{"dur":1,"text":"It's been somehow\nturned underneath."},"610":{"dur":0,"text":"Mars is not like that."},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"Mars has been very stable for\nmillions and millions of years."},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"So you have things that are\non the Mars surface that"},"616":{"dur":1,"text":"have always been on\nthe Mars surface."},"617":{"dur":1,"text":"And from a scientific\nstandpoint,"},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"that actually makes\nit a lot easier"},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"to understand the\nhistory of Mars"},"623":{"dur":1,"text":"than we enjoy here on Earth."},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"And then the last goal,\nfrom a science standpoint,"},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"is preparing for eventual\nhuman exploration."},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"And what we mean is, from\na science standpoint,"},"632":{"dur":1,"text":"understand the\nprocesses on Mars that"},"634":{"dur":1,"text":"might affect human exploration."},"635":{"dur":2,"text":"Understand how the\natmosphere works."},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"Understand, is the surface of\nMars, is the-- what we call--"},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"regolith, which is\nfancy for dirt--"},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"the dirt on Mars, is\nthat toxic to humans?"},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"That was a big question we\nhad when the astronauts went"},"648":{"dur":1,"text":"to the Moon."},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's even more likely\nto be an issue at Mars,"},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"that the regolith might actually\ninclude some things that"},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"are not healthy for humans to\ncome in direct contact with."},"659":{"dur":3,"text":"So getting ready for human\nexploration is a big deal."},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"You guys probably know even\nsending rovers to Mars--"},"665":{"dur":1,"text":"you may not know that\nwe've kind of had"},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"three styles of these rovers."},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"The first one was Sojourner,\nwhich flew in 1997."},"672":{"dur":3,"text":"It lasted about 90 days\non the surface of Mars."},"675":{"dur":3,"text":"And it operated in an area the\nsize of this room, never got"},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"It only could talk back to the\nbase station that was nearby."},"683":{"dur":1,"text":"So if it ever got\nvery far away, it"},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"would lose contact\nwith the base station."},"687":{"dur":4,"text":"And it was really a technology\ndemonstration in 1997."},"691":{"dur":4,"text":"So fast-forward to 2004,\nseven years beyond that."},"695":{"dur":0,"text":"We sent two."},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"We send twins, Spirit\nand Opportunity,"},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"the Mars exploration rovers."},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, those are about\nthe size of a table."},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"And they weigh in the\nneighborhood of 300 pounds each"},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"when they land."},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"And Spirit lasted\nfor seven years"},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"before it got stuck in sand."},"712":{"dur":0,"text":"And the winter came."},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"And its solar panels could\nno longer keep it warm."},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"And we think it froze to death."},"717":{"dur":3,"text":"However, Opportunity, more\nthan 10 years later-- in fact,"},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"12 years now--"},"722":{"dur":1,"text":"has gone more than\n40 kilometers."},"723":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's finished a marathon\non the surface of Mars."},"726":{"dur":1,"text":"It was only supposed\nto last for 90 days,"},"728":{"dur":3,"text":"and it only supposed\nto go for 600 meters."},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's now gone well\nover 40 kilometers."},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"So what I say is, oh, we pay too\nmuch for that system, you know?"},"738":{"dur":1,"text":"The thing should have\ndied a long time ago."},"739":{"dur":4,"text":"And anyway, that's\nhow we do it at JPL."},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"And then finally, Curiosity,\nwhich I think almost all of you"},"746":{"dur":3,"text":"are directly familiar with,\nwe launched it in 2011."},"750":{"dur":1,"text":"It landed in 2012."},"752":{"dur":1,"text":"It's still operating on Mars."},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's one of the things\nthat proved that Mars was,"},"756":{"dur":1,"text":"in fact, a habitable place."},"757":{"dur":2,"text":"Because within its\nfirst 2 kilometers"},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"of roving once it\nlanded at Mars,"},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"it roved through a stream bed."},"764":{"dur":4,"text":"And I mean, it's like\nabsolutely, no questions asked,"},"768":{"dur":0,"text":"a stream bed."},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"So we knew that there\nwas flowing water"},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"on the surface of Mars\nat some time in the past,"},"773":{"dur":1,"text":"And it was direct\nproof when Curiosity"},"775":{"dur":1,"text":"rolled through that stream bed."},"777":{"dur":1,"text":"Just to give you a\nsense-- so we have not"},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"launched these\nguys yet, to Mars,"},"781":{"dur":1,"text":"maybe sometime in the future."},"782":{"dur":1,"text":"But I just wanted to\ngive you some context"},"784":{"dur":1,"text":"for the size of these systems."},"785":{"dur":4,"text":"So Sojourner-- size of,\nlike, a toaster oven."},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"Opportunity and Spirit--\nthe size of a table."},"792":{"dur":3,"text":"And then, Curiosity\nis the size of an SUV."},"796":{"dur":3,"text":"So it weighs 900 kilograms,\nweighs about 2,000 pounds."},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"And if we're going to\never send humans to
