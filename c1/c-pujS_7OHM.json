example?"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"This is Zatisi.

recognized"},"596":{"dur":5,"text":"the opportunity of serving high quality food to their clientele"},"601":{"dur":4,"text":"and essentially being the cafeteria of these

that."},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"But there is sort of a basic problem is they are not making"},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"any money and so their goal becomes how about making money."},"620":{"dur":1,"text":"But what's the bottleneck?"},"622":{"dur":0,"text":"Is it lousy chefs?"},"623":{"dur":1,"text":"Actually, no --they have great chefs."},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"Is that they can't get the food?"},"626":{"dur":1,"text":"Not that really."},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"It turns out the problem is the menu."},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"All the chefs are doing their own thing on the menu and just"},"633":{"dur":3,"text":"making it whatever they want regardless of the season."},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"They are just creating cool food."},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"And so with the

noon."},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"Everybody serves five dishes."},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"Everybody serves three dishes that we know are"},"653":{"dur":1,"text":"popular because what was happening before,"},"655":{"dur":1,"text":"the chefs were just creating new all the time."},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, you have to actually double down on the ones people like"},"661":{"dur":4,"text":"and the next rule was -- and there are two meals that are common"},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"across all the cafeterias so you can do your own thing on three"},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"but you got to be the same with everybody else on two."},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"Within those rules, do what you want."},"675":{"dur":1,"text":"It turns out they not only got profitable,"},"677":{"dur":1,"text":"they also started actually building their revenue"},"679":{"dur":1,"text":"and they doubled in size actually in something"},"680":{"dur":3,"text":"like 18 months so a happily ever after story."},"684":{"dur":6,"text":"Another start-up on creating rules -- this is another sexy topic"},"690":{"dur":4,"text":"of concrete and you probably are not thinking too about

huge"},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"environmental issue around concrete."},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"It also is a very high per capita consumption of concrete"},"709":{"dur":1,"text":"so per capita we all use a lot of concrete,"},"711":{"dur":1,"text":"it's right up there with water,"},"713":{"dur":3,"text":"believe it or not and so what the guys were pretty interested,"},"717":{"dur":3,"text":"was come up with a process that made for concrete that"},"720":{"dur":2,"text":"lowered the emissions in the production of cement,"},"723":{"dur":5,"text":"also was you need to use less cement so that saved -- and then also"},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"it was less likely to crack so less often you had to replace it."},"730":{"dur":4,"text":"So it is kind of an eco win-win-win going on."},"736":{"dur":1,"text":"These are mostly technical guys."},"738":{"dur":5,"text":"So you go to Las Vegas and people enjoy their product and"},"744":{"dur":1,"text":"they get all these partners who want to partner with them,"},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"you know hey, we'll do your concrete."},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"How do they pick?"},"751":{"dur":1,"text":"We have all these partners."},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"So that becomes their bottleneck who we are going to partner with."},"755":{"dur":0,"text":"And they start thinking,"},"756":{"dur":1,"text":"they look over some of their evidence"},"758":{"dur":1,"text":"on who they have worked well with,"},"759":{"dur":1,"text":"think about it, look at other people,"},"760":{"dur":1,"text":"talk and come up with a couple of Simple"},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"Rules about who to partner with."},"766":{"dur":1,"text":"First rule, was about let's partner with"},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"people that have a laser screen machine."},"770":{"dur":2,"text":"That wasn't on top of mind to me."},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"But it turns out it is to them because that's s a signal that,"},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"that partner cares about quality and cares about innovation."},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"If they had that machine, they are into it like we're into it."},"782":{"dur":3,"text":"The second rule was around no duplicate partners."},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"So they've already guessed their own territory."},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"Another rule was around if you haven't started"},"791":{"dur":1,"text":"using our product within three months,"},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"you're done as our partner and then the final rule was"},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"around we had a partner roughly every three months,"},"797":{"dur":1,"text":"we can't do it faster than that because we"},"798":{"dur":3,"text":"can't really absorb the organization."},"802":{"dur":0,"text":"Within that context,"},"803":{"dur":3,"text":"they then basically started selling their concrete around the world."},"807":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay, example."},"809":{"dur":3,"text":"Internet dating rules -- this is my teaser slide."},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"So, you are not going to find it out."},"816":{"dur":0,"text":"Okay."},"818":{"dur":0,"text":"So, Rules 3.0,"},"819":{"dur":1,"text":"you just hear - you'll

different types of rules which as an"},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"academic was pretty interesting to me that there different"},"843":{"dur":2,"text":"types and that they are harder and easier to learn and that"},"846":{"dur":2,"text":"they have more or less implications for performance."},"849":{"dur":3,"text":"So, the geek in me loved that aspect of it;"},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"the practical person in me like the fact that"},"856":{"dur":1,"text":"some actually matter more than others."},"857":{"dur":2,"text":"So let me tell you a little bit about them."},"860":{"dur":1,"text":"First of all, there are boundary rules."},"862":{"dur":2,"text":"Boundary rules as it turns out are pretty easy to learn."},"867":{"dur":2,"text":"Situations were you are deciding yes or no like whether or not to give"},"869":{"dur":3,"text":"bail or you have got a lot of alternatives which one to choose."},"876":{"dur":1,"text":"Group of people who really need a boundary rule are burglar"},"878":{"dur":2,"text":"as it turns out because you know there are a lot of houses"},"881":{"dur":3,"text":"you can burgle but you really don't want to get caught."},"884":{"dur":1,"text":"So what is a good burglar do?"},"886":{"dur":1,"text":"What's the Simple Rule?"},"888":{"dur":2,"text":"Never burgle a house with car in front."},"891":{"dur":2,"text":"It turns out that it is extraordinarily good rule"},"893":{"dur":1,"text":"for knowing whether or not anybody is home."},"897":{"dur":4,"text":"Moving on from burglars -- how about the Weinstein Company?"},"901":{"dur":4,"text":"The Weinstein Company is a movie company as I would think at least"},"906":{"dur":4,"text":"some of you know that in the background there that you can look at,"},"910":{"dur":2,"text":"that is, that is the Imitation Game,"},"912":{"dur":2,"text":"the movie, which is a Weinstein Company movie."},"916":{"dur":2,"text":"If you are a movie company, you see a lot of scripts."},"918":{"dur":2,"text":"There are a lot of would-be writers sending you scripts,"},"921":{"dur":1,"text":"sending you story ideas."},"922":{"dur":1,"text":"How do you pick?"},"925":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, it turns out the Weinstein Company"},"926":{"dur":2,"text":"picks have a couple of simple rules."},"929":{"dur":4,"text":"One of them is always have flaw in sympathetic main characters and"},"933":{"dur":3,"text":"the second is have a story that's about a basic human condition."},"937":{"dur":5,"text":"So if you saw the Imitation Game you know that Alan

he is a flawed with sympathetic main character"},"951":{"dur":2,"text":"and then he is dealing with homosexuality which then"},"953":{"dur":2,"text":"adds sort of a social problem on top of it."},"956":{"dur":2,"text":"That's top of mind for at least some people."},"959":{"dur":2,"text":"Another movie by them is The Silver Lining's"},"962":{"dur":2,"text":"Playbook again dealing with mental illness."},"964":{"dur":3,"text":"The Artist, the King's Speech dealing with difficulties"},"968":{"dur":1,"text":"and you know in talking obviously."},"970":{"dur":3,"text":"That's sort of their genre -- flawed with sympathetic main character,"},"974":{"dur":2,"text":"serious, common human condition."},"977":{"dur":2,"text":"So what movie wouldn't they do?"},"979":{"dur":3,"text":"Gone Girl -- did you all see Gone Girl?"},"982":{"dur":2,"text":"Talk about unlikable characters."},"985":{"dur":3,"text":"They're not Weinstein Company characters."},"988":{"dur":2,"text":"Also The Birdman -- have you saw The Birdman,"},"991":{"dur":2,"text":"another movie Weinstein will never do."},"993":{"dur":1,"text":"Too annoying, those people are too annoying."},"995":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, now they are boundary rules."},"998":{"dur":2,"text":"This is actually a start-up company called Frontier Dental."},"1001":{"dur":1,"text":"And here the problem is."},"1002":{"dur":1,"text":"And those of you who started consumption,"},"1004":{"dur":4,"text":"you try selling the product and you talk to a hundred"},"1008":{"dur":1,"text":"people and

out"},"2472":{"dur":1,"text":"of Mountain View and go to New York City."},"2474":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean it's not going to take off at Mountain View."},"2476":{"dur":2,"text":"It's going to take off in New York or cities like New York."},"2478":{"dur":3,"text":"So they go to New York, every week they're going to New York,"},"2483":{"dur":1,"text":"so that's a third part of the story,"},"2485":{"dur":1,"text":"get the advice from a New York expert."},"2487":{"dur":1,"text":"They go to New York and it's on the ground."},"2488":{"dur":3,"text":"They're doing experiments for

what"},"2520":{"dur":2,"text":"they realized with the combination of the Tuesday dinners,"},"2523":{"dur":2,"text":"expert advice, on the ground,"},"2525":{"dur":1,"text":"seeing people, it's about the hosts."},"2526":{"dur":2,"text":"And it particularly develops some ideas"},"2529":{"dur":1,"text":"around how do you recruit a host."},"2531":{"dur":2,"text":"It's about a certain kind of party

clean sheets, professional photos."},"2559":{"dur":3,"text":"And so the point is that many successful entrepreneurs,"},"2563":{"dur":2,"text":"many successful business people on established"},"2566":{"dur":2,"text":"corporations improve their initial rules,"},"2569":{"dur":3,"text":"making them more strategic by multiple ways of learning."},"2575":{"dur":2,"text":"Finally, we

streaming."},"2712":{"dur":1,"text":"You don't have any content."},"2714":{"dur":2,"text":"How are you going to create content that stands out?"},"2716":{"dur":2,"text":"And so what Netflix does is basically"},"2719":{"dur":2,"text":"break all the rules of television."},"2722":{"dur":3,"text":"First of all, they do have great writing."},"2726":{"dur":3,"text":"And that wasn't that path breaking because"},"2730":{"dur":2,"text":"shows like the Sopranos and Homeland,"},"2733":{"dur":3,"text":"they're also great writing -- the Wire - edgy great writing."},"2736":{"dur":2,"text":"But they broke,

likable."},"2747":{"dur":2,"text":"It isn't this cast of characters that you see every week."},"2750":{"dur":2,"text":"Their characters aren't explored and so forth."},"2753":{"dur":3,"text":"So first point, Netflix breaks the television"},"2757":{"dur":2,"text":"rules and copies more The Sopranos like rules."},"2760":{"dur":1,"text":"But where is the real breakout?"},"2762":{"dur":3,"text":"The
