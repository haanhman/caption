counter"},"71":{"dur":6,"text":"regulatory hormones, such as glucagon,\nepinephrine, cortisol, growth hormone."},"77":{"dur":3,"text":"When the body starts to move and\nstarts to exercise,"},"80":{"dur":3,"text":"the liver is gonna mobilize fuel for\nthose activities."},"85":{"dur":2,"text":"So your gonna have\ngluconeogenesis as needed and"},"88":{"dur":3,"text":"you're gonna have glycogenolysis\nof what's already stored."},"92":{"dur":5,"text":"There's also gonna be a release of free\nfatty acids from adipose tissue and"},"98":{"dur":3,"text":"increase of glucose uptake by the muscles."},"101":{"dur":4,"text":"The more strenuous activity,\nthe more glucose that's disposed or"},"106":{"dur":4,"text":"the longer the duration,\nthe more glucose that's disposed."},"111":{"dur":5,"text":"There at the same time will be\na reduction in insulin production."},"116":{"dur":4,"text":"So if you don't have diabetes, you will\nagain, orchestrate this perfect hormone"},"121":{"dur":3,"text":"balance between the hormones\nthat are raising blood sugar and"},"124":{"dur":2,"text":"insulin, which are lowering it."},"127":{"dur":1,"text":"So that during exercise,"},"128":{"dur":4,"text":"somebody without diabetes is not\ngoing to get a low blood sugar."},"133":{"dur":4,"text":"Now let's look at what happens with\nsomebody specifically with type one"},"138":{"dur":5,"text":"diabetes who has not had insulin and\nthat could be a teenager who just decided"},"144":{"dur":5,"text":"to take a vacation from injections\nthat day and didn't inject,

and"},"167":{"dur":3,"text":"mobilize free fatty acid\nfrom adipose tissue."},"170":{"dur":6,"text":"But without the insulin, the muscle\nuptake of glucose is impaired greatly."},"176":{"dur":6,"text":"Fats are not metabolized properly and\nyou have ketone synthesis increase."},"183":{"dur":4,"text":"The net result is hyperglycemia and\nketosis and you can't take somebody in"},"188":{"dur":4,"text":"this situation and have them run in\nplace to try to lower their blood sugar,"},"192":{"dur":2,"text":"it'll just drive more ketone

monitor."},"209":{"dur":2,"text":"They also have ketone monitors."},"212":{"dur":4,"text":"So the precautions for somebody with type\none diabetes to catch this before it"},"216":{"dur":3,"text":"happens is to check blood\nglucose before exercising."},"219":{"dur":4,"text":"And if they have a surprise 300 and\nthey're not sure why,"},"223":{"dur":2,"text":"hey should check for ketones."},"226":{"dur":3,"text":"An example, on a pump, somebody has a 300."},"229":{"dur":3,"text":"The pump has a memory of\nwhen the last dose was."},"232":{"dur":2,"text":"The person can look at it and\nsay, oh, I'm 300,"},"235":{"dur":2,"text":"because I forgot to bolus this for lunch."},"237":{"dur":3,"text":"But if they did bolus for lunch and\nit's an hour later and their 300,"},"241":{"dur":3,"text":"you have to start thinking,\nmaybe the pump didn't deliver the insulin."},"244":{"dur":5,"text":"So checking for ketones lets you know if\nyour insulin isn't there or isn't working"},"250":{"dur":5,"text":"and if somebody has ketones, they should\nnot exercise until that's resolved."},"255":{"dur":4,"text":"Also if somebody doesn't have ketones,\nmaybe they're checking urine ketones."},"259":{"dur":1,"text":"Remember, that's a delayed picture,"},"261":{"dur":3,"text":"you have to accumulate the ketones\nin the bladder before they show up."},"265":{"dur":4,"text":"They might still have ketones in the\nblood, but not showing up in the urine yet"},"269":{"dur":1,"text":"or they might not have ketones."},"271":{"dur":2,"text":"They might just have high blood sugar."},"273":{"dur":3,"text":"But when you have the increase\nkinda regulatory hormones,"},"277":{"dur":3,"text":"that 300 can turn to 350 can turn to 400."},"280":{"dur":4,"text":"So if you're that high, you probably need\nto take a little insulin if you have type"},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"one diabetes and\nwait to start your exercise."},"287":{"dur":1,"text":"The difference here and"},"288":{"dur":3,"text":"what becomes confusing is we're really\nlooking at two totally different diseases."},"292":{"dur":5,"text":"If you're looking at someone with type 2\ndiabetes who has insulin resistance and"},"297":{"dur":4,"text":"their blood sugar is 300,\nthey might find that going out and"},"302":{"dur":5,"text":"doing a walk is gonna help lower that,\nbecause exercise lowers insulin resistance"},"307":{"dur":3,"text":"and the contracting muscle helps\npull in and clear glucose."},"311":{"dur":3,"text":"So, a type two who's not at risk so\nmuch for"},"314":{"dur":4,"text":"diabetic ketoacidosis may go out and\nexercise."},"319":{"dur":2,"text":"So when you're having this\ndiscussion with a

complications,"},"328":{"dur":3,"text":"we wanna make some advice\ntailored to that person."},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"If you have somebody with\nperipheral neuropathy,"},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"maybe they don't feel their feet so well."},"337":{"dur":4,"text":"One of the complications of that can\nbe that they don't position their foot"},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"correctly when they're walking or\nrunning and"},"344":{"dur":3,"text":"that can damage a joint\ncalled sacral joint syndrome."},"347":{"dur":4,"text":"And you wouldn't want something who\ndoesn't feel their feet to be on a

fine."},"374":{"dur":3,"text":"Think of somebody who has\nbackground retinopathy."},"378":{"dur":4,"text":"You don't want to be a heavy weight\nlifter, the machines at the gym

and"},"429":{"dur":3,"text":"the supplies handy through\nthe duration of their activity."},"433":{"dur":3,"text":"Their meter can't be in the locker,\nif they're on the football field for"},"436":{"dur":0,"text":"the next three hours."},"438":{"dur":4,"text":"Hypoglycemia is a risk, so\nthat person needs to carry"},"443":{"dur":4,"text":"everything they would need to treat or\neven to prevent that low blood sugar."},"448":{"dur":5,"text":"If you know that your child is starting\nsoccer and that's a big difference"},"453":{"dur":5,"text":"from being sedentary previous months,\nthen medications will probably"},"458":{"dur":5,"text":"need to be reduced to accommodate that\nincrease in activity without causing lows."},"464":{"dur":4,"text":"Hydration is important whenever blood\nsugar levels are significantly elevated,"},"469":{"dur":3,"text":"that's having the kidneys remove\nglucose through increase urination"},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"causes dehydration."},"474":{"dur":4,"text":"And when you add exercise,\nespecially in heat and perspiration,"},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"that increases fluid needs as well."},"480":{"dur":1,"text":"We want proper foot care,"},"482":{"dur":4,"text":"especially for somebody who has\ndiminished sensation in their feet."},"486":{"dur":4,"text":"So you don't need to tell an eight year\nold, newly diagnosed kid that there're"},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"problems with their feet and\nthey shouldn't be barefoot."},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"Now that child doesn't\nhave any complications,"},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"they can run around like any other kid."},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"It's somebody who's had\nlong duration diabetes and"},"500":{"dur":4,"text":"does have diminished sensation or issues\nwith circulation that needs to be very"},"504":{"dur":4,"text":"careful about not ending up with a wound\nin their foot that doesn't heal."},"509":{"dur":4,"text":"When blood sugar is high, bacteria love\nit and then infections can fester."},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's what leads to\nthe potential amputations."},"517":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's important to also have medical ID."},"521":{"dur":5,"text":"If something happens you want to be\nrecognized as somebody that has diabetes."},"526":{"dur":4,"text":"So the most common risk with\nexercise is low blood glucose."},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's because\nthe muscles are taking up and"},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"burning glucose through\nthe whole activity."},"536":{"dur":6,"text":"And depending on the activity, you may\nbe depleting glycogen stores as well."},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"So, to prevent that,\nyou can make adjustments to insulin and"},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"to carbohydrate intake."},"548":{"dur":4,"text":"So consider somebody who's gonna eat\nlunch, take their rapid-acting insulin,"},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"and knows they're gonna go out and\nplay basketball right after."},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe it's a kid whose PE\nclass is right after lunch."},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"Or maybe it's an adult\nwho's planning an activity"},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"in the early afternoon after the meal."},"565":{"dur":3,"text":"If you know that's coming,\nyou can take a smaller dose for"},"569":{"dur":5,"text":"that meal, because the insulin\nwill last about four hours."},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"It peaks in 30 to 90 minutes."},"576":{"dur":4,"text":"If you're gonna be exercising during that\ntime, the sheer activity of the muscles"},"580":{"dur":4,"text":"contracting facilitate that insulin\naction and you actually need less."},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"You need insulin, but less."},"587":{"dur":4,"text":"However, if its gonna be four or\nmore hours roughly since you ate and"},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"took that rapid acting insulin and\nyou're gonna go out and"},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"do a bike ride,\nthere's no insulin to reduce."},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"But you could add carbohydrates\nto prevent the low."},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"So a small snack perhaps."},"603":{"dur":3,"text":"One nice thing about being on an insulin\npump is you can reach right down and"},"607":{"dur":1,"text":"you can turn down your basal rate."},"608":{"dur":5,"text":"If you're running at 0.8 unit per hour\nyou can say I wanna 50% reduction and"},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"turn it down then and there."},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"Whereas somebody injecting a long-acting\ninsulin cannot do that and"},"620":{"dur":1,"text":"may need to add carbs."},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"So when people are on insulin\nto carbohydrate ratios and"},"626":{"dur":3,"text":"you know that they have regular activity\non Tuesdays and Thursdays that's pretty"},"630":{"dur":4,"text":"strenuous, the doctors will\nsometimes give a different ratio."},"635":{"dur":4,"text":"So for example, if you have\nsomebody who takes one unit for"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"every 15grams of carbohydrate."},"642":{"dur":5,"text":"If they ate 60 grams, that's 4 units."},"647":{"dur":4,"text":"If that person on a sedentary\nday had a different ratio,"},"652":{"dur":5,"text":"say 1 for every 10 grams,\n60 grams is 6 units."},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"So by just having a different ratio,"},"660":{"dur":4,"text":"it gives them a way to calculate their\ndose on a sedentary versus active day."},"664":{"dur":5,"text":"In some cases doses are reduced\nby 20 to 50% for activities."},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's look at this slide."},"672":{"dur":3,"text":"The blue lines are showing\na rapid acting insulin."},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"It could be any of the ones\nthat are out there."},"677":{"dur":3,"text":"The green line is the long acting insulin."},"680":{"dur":3,"text":"This is just a visual of\nwhat I just spoke about."},"683":{"dur":1,"text":"In the first arrow,"},"685":{"dur":4,"text":"you're seeing exercise during a time\nwhen the insulin in very strong."},"690":{"dur":4,"text":"I would reduce the dose, maybe at 20,\n25, or it depends on the exercise,"},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"but reducing the dose there."},"696":{"dur":3,"text":"Whereas later,\nthe one that's occurring around 5 PM,"},"700":{"dur":4,"text":"there's no rapid acting insulin on board,\nit's just the long acting."},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"You can make that decision about\nwhether you need a snack or"},"707":{"dur":1,"text":"not based on your blood sugar."},"709":{"dur":3,"text":"So if the blood sugar's 180,\nyou don't really need a snack,"},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"that exercise will help\nclear some of that glucose."},"715":{"dur":3,"text":"However, if you're 100 and\nyou're gonna go for a 3 mile jog,"},"718":{"dur":3,"text":"you're probably gonna need\nsome carbohydrate for that."},"723":{"dur":3,"text":"So carbohydrate tips are for\nunplanned exercise,"},"727":{"dur":4,"text":"add carbohydrates as needed\nto prevent low blood glucose."},"732":{"dur":3,"text":"Eat carbohydrates before,\nperhaps during and"},"735":{"dur":3,"text":"after activity as needed\nto prevent hypoglycemia."},"738":{"dur":4,"text":"So you have somebody at a swim\nmeet whose gonna be swimming for"},"742":{"dur":4,"text":"several hours, they might be drinking\na four ounce juice every hour."},"747":{"dur":1,"text":"They don't want something\nheavy in their stomach."},"749":{"dur":4,"text":"So that is a time and a place where small\namounts of juice through a longer activity"},"754":{"dur":1,"text":"can actually mitigate a low."},"757":{"dur":4,"text":"Keep carbohydrates handy as snacks,\nas needed."},"761":{"dur":4,"text":"But also, if your blood sugar is below\n100 and you're about to exercise,"},"766":{"dur":3,"text":"the first carbs that go in should\nbe rapid carbs to bring you up."},"769":{"dur":3,"text":"And then maybe something,\na granola bar, it could be anything,"},"773":{"dur":4,"text":"that's gonna digest more over time\ncan be followed after the juice."},"779":{"dur":3,"text":"So why might exercise\nactually raise blood glucose?"},"782":{"dur":3,"text":"And sometimes people say, I can't believe\nit, I pulled him off the basketball court,"},"786":{"dur":3,"text":"I checked his blood sugar,\nit was higher than when he started."},"789":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, if you're in the middle\nof a heated game and"},"791":{"dur":3,"text":"you've got all this adrenaline, your\nheart's racing and you're competitive,"},"795":{"dur":4,"text":"it may be that you're catching that\nmobilization of glucose from the liver."},"799":{"dur":5,"text":"And the blood glucose looks higher\nbecause of that mobilizing substrate."},"805":{"dur":5,"text":"If you're gonna give a correction,\nmaybe the blood glucose is 300, if you're"},"810":{"dur":5,"text":"gonna give a correction, be a little\nbit careful about how much you give."},"815":{"dur":3,"text":"You might not use your\nnormal correction ratio."},"819":{"dur":3,"text":"Because they're gonna go back in,\nthey're gonna burn off more glucose."},"823":{"dur":2,"text":"And when the game is entirely over,"},"825":{"dur":5,"text":"the glucose is gonna shift back\nsomewhat to the muscles and the liver."},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"And so\nyou don't wanna give an over correction."},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"Beware of delayed hypoglycemia."},"838":{"dur":5,"text":"The muscle contraction during exercise\nwill increase GLUT4 transporters"},"843":{"dur":4,"text":"at the cell's surface and\nmake it much easier to clear glucose."},"847":{"dur":4,"text":"That transport system,\nthat insulin sensitivity, that improved"},"852":{"dur":4,"text":"transport of glucose will persist for\na while after the activity is over."},"857":{"dur":3,"text":"That's a great thing for\na type 2, to have that"},"860":{"dur":4,"text":"ongoing benefit of exercise that lasts for\nawhile after their activity."},"865":{"dur":5,"text":"But for a type 1, it could also lead\nto a shifting back of glucose and"},"870":{"dur":1,"text":"a hypoglycemia."},"872":{"dur":4,"text":"And that can happen immediately after,\nor it could happen hours and"},"876":{"dur":4,"text":"hours after the activity, depending\non how much glycogen was depleted and"},"880":{"dur":1,"text":"then replenished."},"882":{"dur":4,"text":"So we want to shift gears and\ntalk about type 2 for a second."},"886":{"dur":4,"text":"We want to encourage exercise,\nit is along with diet control and"},"890":{"dur":5,"text":"weight control, the therapy for\ntype 2 diabetes, is to get people moving."},"895":{"dur":3,"text":"And if they're doing anything, just get\nthem to walk to the corner and back."},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"Start with something manageable and\nbuild on that."},"901":{"dur":1,"text":"Say, can you do 5 minutes a day?"},"903":{"dur":2,"text":"In a week would make it 10 minutes."},"905":{"dur":4,"text":"So the idea here is that exercise\nis a treatment for type 2,"},"909":{"dur":3,"text":"because it decreases insulin resistance."},"912":{"dur":1,"text":"That's their defect."},"914":{"dur":5,"text":"It increases glucose uptake, that's gonna\nhelp control their blood glucose levels."},"920":{"dur":2,"text":"It also mobilizes and burns fat."},"922":{"dur":2,"text":"Helps with weight management."},"924":{"dur":1,"text":"It improves lipids."},"925":{"dur":5,"text":"So exercise can raise HDL levels and\nhelp lower triglyceride and LDL."},"931":{"dur":2,"text":"It improves cardiovascular fitness."},"933":{"dur":3,"text":"And people who exercise tend to\nhave have lower blood pressure."},"937":{"dur":1,"text":"So it improves hypertension."},"938":{"dur":4,"text":"70 some percent of adults with\ntype 2 diabetes are hypertensive."},"943":{"dur":3,"text":"80% or so are overweight."},"946":{"dur":4,"text":"So this exercise can help across\nthe board with many of their problems."},"950":{"dur":3,"text":"It reduces stress in for\neverybody who has diabetes."},"954":{"dur":3,"text":"That's a life-long condition, and\nthat can lead to depression, and anxiety,"},"957":{"dur":0,"text":"and stress."},"958":{"dur":3,"text":"And exercise does help manage that."},"961":{"dur":3,"text":"It can be as simple as walking for\npeople with type two diabetes,"},"965":{"dur":2,"text":"it doesn't have to be\na big exercise regimen."},"969":{"dur":2,"text":"So the prescription would\nbe aerobic activity and"},"972":{"dur":3,"text":"the surgeon general says,\nwe should all get 30 minutes a
