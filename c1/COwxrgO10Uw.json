she decided that she couldnt just say\nthat she didnt like it, but she had to do"},"1002":{"dur":1,"text":"something about it."},"1003":{"dur":4,"text":"So, she switched her major into teaching

more"},"1199":{"dur":3,"text":"people that are not from Hawaii that live\nhere than are from here."},"1203":{"dur":5,"text":"So, that has changed the culture in some ways\ngood and in some ways, not

really hurt ourselves."},"1245":{"dur":4,"text":">> The truth is, when you--when we mix cultures,\nthen something changes and something shifts."},"1250":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, Kanu really wants to
