first want to explain how these free services"},"43":{"dur":1,"text":"actually work."},"45":{"dur":4,"text":"What happens is, there's a lot of developers\nout there who have house and land packages"},"49":{"dur":4,"text":"or units or what they call \"property stock\"\n- they call it \"stock\" in the industry - that"},"54":{"dur":2,"text":"they need to sell and they need to get

real estate agent has\ntrouble selling this so they enlist the help"},"66":{"dur":4,"text":"of property advisers, property marketers,\nproperty mentors to do this."},"71":{"dur":6,"text":"And generally, property advisers are getting\na large commission on the sale of that property."},"78":{"dur":4,"text":"Like a real estate agent gets a commission\nbut this commission tends to be a lot higher"},"82":{"dur":1,"text":"than a real estate agent."},"83":{"dur":5,"text":"Where a real estate might be 1-2%, a property\nmarketer's commission might be anywhere from"},"89":{"dur":1,"text":"6-10%."},"90":{"dur":2,"text":"It is very discretionary and it does depend."},"93":{"dur":5,"text":"The lowest commission that it's ever going\nto be is about $5,000 but that's very rare."},"98":{"dur":4,"text":"Generally, we see commissions around the $20,000\nto $40,000 or higher range."},"102":{"dur":2,"text":"So there are very large commissions going\ninto this deal."},"105":{"dur":4,"text":"And so even though they offer, they say their\nservices are for \"free\", what is happening"},"110":{"dur":2,"text":"is they are getting paid by the developers."},"112":{"dur":5,"text":"So they're incentivised to sell this property\nstock to people because they only get paid"},"117":{"dur":1,"text":"when they sell stock."},"119":{"dur":3,"text":"And they only have a select list of items\nthat they're actually going to get a commission"},"123":{"dur":1,"text":"on."},"124":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's with the developers that they're\nworking with."},"126":{"dur":4,"text":"Generally, there's developer aggregates; so\nthey bring together all these different developers."},"131":{"dur":2,"text":"You then get - as a marketer - you get a stock\nlist."},"134":{"dur":4,"text":"And so I've been provided these, here's a\nstock list of the properties that we have"},"138":{"dur":1,"text":"and that you can

works."},"153":{"dur":5,"text":"It will vary depending on the particular property\nadvisor, mentor or marketer that you're working"},"159":{"dur":7,"text":"with but that's kind of a broad overview of\ngenerally how it works in the industry."},"166":{"dur":4,"text":"Another thing that you need to know when you're\ngoing into this is that the capital growth"},"171":{"dur":5,"text":"reports sometimes they come from reputable\nsources like RP Data and stuff like that."},"176":{"dur":4,"text":"But the pretty reports, they way that they\nhave been done are generally provided to

get."},"197":{"dur":2,"text":"So always take those reports with a grain\nof salt."},"200":{"dur":5,"text":"Another thing I want you to keep in mind throughout\nthis video; is just because an area is a

investing in an area that is growing\nbut you're paying $40,000 more or $50,000"},"218":{"dur":4,"text":"more for property than what it's actually\nworth, it's going to take you years and years"},"223":{"dur":3,"text":"for the market to actually catch up with what\nyour property is worth."},"227":{"dur":5,"text":"So just because an area is growing; they provide\nyou with reports that

deal."},"257":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, I'm going to go into the 7 things you\nshould do before buying property from a property"},"262":{"dur":1,"text":"advisor."},"263":{"dur":3,"text":"And the reason that I recommend that you do\nthis - look, not all deals out there are bad"},"267":{"dur":2,"text":"but there are a lot of bad deals out there."},"269":{"dur":3,"text":"There are a lot of properties that people\nare buying that are overpriced and I have"},"273":{"dur":4,"text":"multiple friends who have actually gone through\nthis process."},"277":{"dur":4,"text":"Purchased properties that were completely\noverpriced; we're talking $30,000, $40,000,"},"281":{"dur":4,"text":"$50,000 overpriced and 5 years later, the\nproperty still isn't worth what they paid"},"286":{"dur":1,"text":"for it."},"287":{"dur":3,"text":"And they need to hold that property because\nif they sell it, they're going to take a loss."},"290":{"dur":3,"text":"So before you go into this, it's important\nthat you do your research."},"294":{"dur":4,"text":"The first thing that you should do when you're\nworking with a property advisor is find out"},"298":{"dur":3,"text":"exactly how much commission they are getting."},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"They generally make commission in a couple\nof different ways."},"304":{"dur":3,"text":"The main way is through the developer like\nI discussed."},"308":{"dur":4,"text":"The other ways are through their mortgage\nbroking services; so they'll make a commission"},"312":{"dur":5,"text":"on the mortgage broking fee and also through\ninsurances and sometimes through the setup"},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"of self-managed super funds if you're going\ndown that route."},"320":{"dur":3,"text":"But the biggest commission is going to be\nfrom the developer."},"324":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, to find out how much commission you're\ngetting."},"328":{"dur":2,"text":"It's actually not as easy as you would hope."},"330":{"dur":4,"text":"Generally when you ask a property advisor,\nhow much commission are you making on this"},"334":{"dur":1,"text":"deal?"},"335":{"dur":4,"text":"They'll throw out something quite arbitrary,\noh, we make similar commission to what a real"},"340":{"dur":2,"text":"estate agent makes; oh, you know, it's not\nthat much."},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"It's just a fee for our services."},"345":{"dur":4,"text":"But it's very important that you find out\nexactly what this figure is."},"349":{"dur":3,"text":"Because this figure is generally a significant\namount of money."},"353":{"dur":5,"text":"And generally, I'm not actually 100% sure\nif they need to disclose that figure to you"},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"but I'm pretty sure that they will need to\ndisclose it some way."},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"It's going to be hidden in the fine print\nsomewhere."},"364":{"dur":3,"text":"But before you go ahead, it's important that\nyou understand how much are they making out"},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"of this deal and are you comfortable doing\nthat?"},"371":{"dur":4,"text":"To give you an idea, a buyer's agent - which\nis someone that you would pay out of your"},"375":{"dur":6,"text":"own pocket to help you find a property - they\ngenerally charge between about 1% to 3%."},"382":{"dur":4,"text":"And so you're looking at about $5,000 to $15,000\nor $20,000 for a buyer's agent."},"386":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's someone with no conflicts of interest,\ngenerally."},"390":{"dur":4,"text":"Not always but generally because they're getting\npaid by you and working for you and generally"},"394":{"dur":5,"text":"it's to buy existing property which these\ndeveloper cuts and developer commissions,"},"400":{"dur":1,"text":"they're not available in existing properties."},"401":{"dur":4,"text":"So, to give you an idea, you're looking at\nthe $5,000 to $15,000 range for a buyer's"},"406":{"dur":1,"text":"agent."},"407":{"dur":3,"text":"So to find out what commission your property\nadvisor is getting, you can then compare that"},"411":{"dur":3,"text":"to a buyer's agent and you can say, well,\nreally, this service isn't free."},"415":{"dur":4,"text":"They are getting paid this amount of money\nand am I comfortable with them receiving this"},"419":{"dur":3,"text":"amount of money for the deal and for the service\nthat I'm getting?"},"423":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's the first thing."},"424":{"dur":3,"text":"And look, if they don't tell you how much\ncommission that they're getting and they're"},"427":{"dur":3,"text":"too scared to tell you, that should be a big\nred flag for you."},"431":{"dur":4,"text":"If they're too scared to say, look, we're\nmaking $22,000 off this or we're making $30,000"},"435":{"dur":3,"text":"or $40,000 from this and we make it in these\nways."},"439":{"dur":3,"text":"If they're not comfortable to tell you that,\nthen you should be worried."},"442":{"dur":4,"text":"You should look into that in more detail and\ndon't just take their airy-fairy response"},"447":{"dur":5,"text":"that, oh, yeah, just a service [inaudible\n7:29] fees or similar to a real estate agent;"},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"because you need to know."},"454":{"dur":5,"text":"That is my number one tip and that's the easiest\nway to find out what you're actually getting"},"459":{"dur":1,"text":"and what they're actually receiving."},"461":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that's very important."},"462":{"dur":4,"text":"The second thing to do is find out if they\noffer rental guarantees on their property."},"467":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, a lot of the market rental guarantees\nis a way to get people through the door."},"471":{"dur":4,"text":"You're investing in property, it's a big risk,\nyou're putting a lot of money into it."},"475":{"dur":5,"text":"A rental guarantee on the outset looks like\na great idea because you're getting a guarantee"},"481":{"dur":1,"text":"that the rental income is going to come in."},"482":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, these rental guarantees usually last\nfor 1 to 2 years."},"486":{"dur":4,"text":"And then what happens, it's been well-documented\nthat this is kind of a scheme in the industry"},"491":{"dur":4,"text":"that they offer these rental guarantees to\nbe able to sell the property at a higher price."},"495":{"dur":4,"text":"They then rent out the property and then whatever\nthe deficit is between what they can actually"},"500":{"dur":4,"text":"rent it for and what the rental guarantee\nis, they pay that out and then after 2 years"},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"they disappear and you're left with the property."},"507":{"dur":4,"text":"Generally, what happens, if you see them offering\nrental guarantees, immediately, that is a"},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"red flag."},"513":{"dur":5,"text":"If a property is well-priced for the market\nand it's going to be rented for the price"},"519":{"dur":3,"text":"they're advertised, you shouldn't need to\noffer a rental guarantee."},"523":{"dur":5,"text":"If you're investing in Sydney, you're going\nto know that there is high demand for those"},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"sorts of properties."},"529":{"dur":6,"text":"You're going to know that the vacancy rate\nis really low and so in terms of rental guarantees,"},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"you really shouldn't need that."},"537":{"dur":1,"text":"And if you see it, it's a red flag."},"539":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm going to talk about more about the research\nyou can do around the value of the property"},"544":{"dur":3,"text":"but also the rental value in one of the next\nsteps."},"547":{"dur":4,"text":"But, yes, if you see a rental guarantee, be\nred-flagged."},"552":{"dur":5,"text":"Consider that a warning sign and look into\nthat in extreme detail if you see that."},"557":{"dur":4,"text":"Because that rental guarantee is being paid\nby someone and it's generally being paid by"},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"you."},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's added to the purchase price of the\nproperty."},"565":{"dur":4,"text":"Even though it's not \"technically\" added to\nthe purchase price of the property, that money"},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"has to come from somewhere."},"571":{"dur":5,"text":"Okay, third thing is to look for similar existing\nproperties in the area."},"577":{"dur":4,"text":"One thing that these property marketers and\nthese property advisors, the reason that they"},"581":{"dur":3,"text":"exist is there's a lot of people who want\nto invest in property but they don't actually"},"585":{"dur":4,"text":"want to go to all the effort of understanding\nan area and knowing which area is good to"},"590":{"dur":1,"text":"invest."},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"So they rely on these advisors to help them."},"593":{"dur":4,"text":"But one of the things that you should do - because\nas we discussed earlier, these reports are"},"597":{"dur":3,"text":"often provided by the developers; which is\na big conflict of interest."},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"So you actually want to look at; well, what\nis going to be the purchase price of this"},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"house and land package or unit? or whatever\nit is that you're buying."},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"What's going to be the end price that you\nend up paying?"},"610":{"dur":6,"text":"Well, now, go on realestate.com.au or go to\ndomain.com.au and look in the area that you're"},"617":{"dur":4,"text":"purchasing and try and find properties that\nare similar to the one that you will end up"},"622":{"dur":1,"text":"with."},"623":{"dur":5,"text":"You want to find out how much are these properties\nworth and you want to find out whether that"},"628":{"dur":3,"text":"is similar to the property that you're going\nto be getting."},"632":{"dur":5,"text":"Is your property a lot more expensive than\nones that you can buy and what's the difference"},"637":{"dur":1,"text":"in those types of properties?"},"638":{"dur":5,"text":"So go in to the area and if it's a 4-bedroom,\n2-bathroom house with a double garage or a"},"644":{"dur":3,"text":"single garage that you're investing in in\nan area, well there's going to be some of"},"648":{"dur":1,"text":"those in the area already."},"649":{"dur":5,"text":"So go on realestate.com.au, find out how much\nthose properties are selling for; compare"},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"it to the package that you're getting and\nsee if there's a difference there."},"658":{"dur":3,"text":"Another thing to do is the same but in the\nrental market."},"662":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you're getting a rental guarantee on\nthis property or you're getting a rental estimate"},"666":{"dur":5,"text":"provided for you on this property, go on to\nrealestate.com.au, look at the rent section"},"671":{"dur":4,"text":"and find similar properties and find out what\nthey're asking in terms of rental price."},"676":{"dur":4,"text":"You know, with the purchase price of a property,\nit can be difficult because some areas like"},"681":{"dur":5,"text":"Syndey are very hot and things are going for\nway beyond what they're marketed for and then"},"686":{"dur":5,"text":"other areas aren't as hot and are probably\nas marketed for a price and actually ends"},"691":{"dur":1,"text":"up going for a discount."},"693":{"dur":4,"text":"So, the purchase price can be a little bit\ndifficult but you can find out pretty roughly"},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"what a property's going to be like."},"699":{"dur":3,"text":"But in the rental market, that negotiation\nreally takes place."},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"So whatever a property is advertised for,\nit's generally what it's going to be rented"},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"for."},"707":{"dur":4,"text":"This is a good way to understand how does\nthe rent compare to what they've told me."},"711":{"dur":5,"text":"So this is all about doing your own research\nand understanding what is on offer, what are"},"716":{"dur":1,"text":"they offering you?"},"717":{"dur":4,"text":"And how does that compare to if you actually\nwent to the market yourself and just purchased"},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"a property in the same area."},"724":{"dur":4,"text":"So if they give me all these reports saying\nthis area is a great area to invest in and"},"729":{"dur":1,"text":"you understand that and you think, okay, that's\ngreat."},"731":{"dur":1,"text":"I want to invest in that area."},"733":{"dur":5,"text":"Well now, you need to consider your options\nbetween should I buy a package from the property"},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"advisor or could I just go out there and buy\nan existing property?"},"742":{"dur":1,"text":"What's going to be better value?"},"743":{"dur":1,"text":"That's what you want to understand."},"744":{"dur":4,"text":"Because if you decide the area's good, you\nwant to buy the best property for that area"},"748":{"dur":1,"text":"for the best price."},"749":{"dur":6,"text":"The next thing that you should do is get advise\nfrom a local real estate agent."},"755":{"dur":3,"text":"Local real estate agents know the area better\nthan anyone else."},"759":{"dur":4,"text":"What generally happens is, people call up\nthe real estate agents 3 or 4 or 5 years later"},"763":{"dur":3,"text":"and say, look, I'm looking at selling this\nproperty and they're like, what did you pay"},"766":{"dur":1,"text":"for it?"},"767":{"dur":5,"text":"Like you paid that for the property, you got\nstung by one of the developers or whatever."},"773":{"dur":1,"text":"They know what's happening in the area."},"775":{"dur":4,"text":"They know how much people are paying for these\ndevelopments, they know how much properties"},"779":{"dur":1,"text":"are selling for."},"780":{"dur":5,"text":"And so when you get your package from your\nproperty advisor, go to a third-party real"},"786":{"dur":5,"text":"estate agent that's unrelated to the developer\nor to the advisor that you're working with"},"791":{"dur":3,"text":"and say, hey, look, I'm really interested\nin this area."},"794":{"dur":3,"text":"I've been offered these sort of development\nthings."},"798":{"dur":1,"text":"What do you think about this?"},"799":{"dur":5,"text":"Can you talk to me about the pricing of this\nproperty, when this property is built?"},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"If I want to rent it out or if I want to sell\nit, what's it going to be worth to the rental"},"808":{"dur":1,"text":"market?"},"809":{"dur":1,"text":"What's it going to be worth to the sales market?"},"811":{"dur":5,"text":"They know, if you develop a 4-bedroom, 2-bathroom\nhouse to these specs, they know what it's"},"817":{"dur":1,"text":"going to likely sell for."},"818":{"dur":1,"text":"They know what it's going to likely rent for."},"820":{"dur":4,"text":"And so you can get that opinion from them;\nwhich is going to be extremely useful."},"824":{"dur":4,"text":"They could then also point you in the direction\nof properties in the area that may be better"},"829":{"dur":1,"text":"deals."},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"Or they could say, look, this is a great deal."},"831":{"dur":5,"text":"The property's going to be worth probably\n$30,000 more than what you paid for it, if"},"837":{"dur":1,"text":"you're lucky."},"838":{"dur":2,"text":"They're going to give you that advise and\nthey're going to give you that input."},"841":{"dur":5,"text":"So it's very important to not just take what\nthe property advisor is giving you at face"},"846":{"dur":1,"text":"value."},"847":{"dur":2,"text":"Because the fact is, they generally do have\nthat conflict of interest."},"850":{"dur":3,"text":"They're getting paid by the developers to\nsell stock."},"853":{"dur":4,"text":"They're not getting paid by you, they're getting\npaid by the developers."},"857":{"dur":4,"text":"And so to get a third-party opinion and to\nunderstand, well, is this actually in my best"},"862":{"dur":2,"text":"interest, not just theirs?"},"864":{"dur":1,"text":"Is very important."},"866":{"dur":5,"text":"The fifth thing that you should do is to Google\nthe heck out of the company that you're looking"},"871":{"dur":1,"text":"into."},"872":{"dur":3,"text":"There's a lot of forums like propertyinvesting.com\nor somersoft.com."},"875":{"dur":4,"text":"Generally, people go on there and say, what\ndo you think about this company?"},"880":{"dur":1,"text":"And people would give you responses."},"882":{"dur":2,"text":"So just go in to Google and search for them."},"884":{"dur":6,"text":"Put

yourself and get people to"},"930":{"dur":1,"text":"give you feedback."},"931":{"dur":3,"text":"It's going to be vital feedback that will\nbe very important."},"934":{"dur":4,"text":"The sixth thing that you should do is talk\nto people who've invested with this company"},"938":{"dur":4,"text":"5 years ago; 3 to 5 or more years ago."},"943":{"dur":4,"text":"If you're talking to people who've just invested,\nthey don't actually know what the value of"},"947":{"dur":4,"text":"their property is, they've gone through the\nbuying experience and, yes, that's well and"},"951":{"dur":1,"text":"good to know."},"952":{"dur":5,"text":"But someone who's 3, 4, 5 or more years down\nthe track, actually understands the value"},"957":{"dur":1,"text":"of their home more."},"958":{"dur":2,"text":"The chance that they've re-valued their home\nis more likely."},"961":{"dur":5,"text":"And you can see, well, have they actually\nachieved the growth that was promised to them?"},"967":{"dur":1,"text":"Was the property overpriced?"},"968":{"dur":1,"text":"Try and get in contact with these people."},"970":{"dur":7,"text":"Now, if you're going to ask the property advisor\nfor people that you can contact, they're generally"},"977":{"dur":1,"text":"going to give you their best clients."},"979":{"dur":1,"text":"Look, I run a membership site."},"980":{"dur":3,"text":"If someone wants to say, can I talk to someone\nabout their experience?"},"983":{"dur":4,"text":"Of course I'm going to point them in the direction\nof someone that loves my service."},"988":{"dur":5,"text":"If you can, find people on the

can email them or find them on Facebook"},"1001":{"dur":3,"text":"or something like that and get in contact\nwith them."},"1004":{"dur":1,"text":"That's a good way to do it."},"1005":{"dur":3,"text":"That's a hard task to do, so I don't expect\nmany people to do that."},"1008":{"dur":4,"text":"But if you are serious and you are curious,\ntry and find those people."},"1012":{"dur":5,"text":"And the last thing that I recommend that you\nshould do is actually consider a buyers agent"},"1018":{"dur":2,"text":"instead of a property
