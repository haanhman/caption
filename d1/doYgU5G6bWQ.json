There are"},"24":{"dur":5,"text":"many thousands of alternative funding bodies\nthat exist out there in Britain which will"},"29":{"dur":4,"text":"potentially fund postgraduate study and indeed\npotentially fund more or less anybody actually"},"34":{"dur":5,"text":"in some cases who make a strong case for funding,\nwhether they're a student or not. So this"},"39":{"dur":4,"text":"is very much I guess the thing to consider,\nyou know, if you are not successful with I"},"43":{"dur":4,"text":"guess one of the more conventional mainstream\nsources of funding such as Research Councils"},"48":{"dur":7,"text":"or university scholarships. To introduce myself,\nI funded my entire PhD in fact in Political"},"56":{"dur":5,"text":"History at Kings College London through using\nthese charities and trusts, winning about"},"61":{"dur":5,"text":"forty different awards. I say those numbers\nnot to blow my own trumpet but to, I suppose,"},"67":{"dur":2,"text":"convince you that some of what I'm going to\ntalk about in the next few minutes is actually"},"70":{"dur":5,"text":"real because some of the funding does seem\na little bit bizarre on the face of it."},"75":{"dur":5,"text":"OK, so I guess the first question would be\nwho is this talk actually aimed at? Well I"},"81":{"dur":4,"text":"would have said that it's really all postgraduate\nstudents. Whether you are interested in doing"},"85":{"dur":4,"text":"a Masters or you're interested in doing a\nPhD, charities and trusts will potentially"},"90":{"dur":6,"text":"be eligible to help you out. In fact, actually\ncharities and trusts in many ways don't mind"},"96":{"dur":4,"text":"whether they're funding a Masters student,\na PhD student or indeed even an undergraduate"},"101":{"dur":4,"text":"student, or indeed even a current or a prospective\nstudent. You can apply in advance of your"},"106":{"dur":6,"text":"course starting or indeed during your course\nas well. Also charities and trusts can be"},"113":{"dur":5,"text":"used by students who are partially funded.\nSo, for example, you might have a partial"},"118":{"dur":5,"text":"scholarship from some particular source, or\nif you are entirely self-funded. In additional"},"124":{"dur":5,"text":"also a fourth year PhD student can use these\ncharities as well, for example maybe you get"},"130":{"dur":4,"text":"a funded a PhD for three years and then you\nhave to fund the fourth year yourself. There"},"134":{"dur":4,"text":"are a lot of charities and trusts, for example\nthe Gilchrist Charitable Trust, the Yorkshire"},"139":{"dur":5,"text":"Ladies Council of Education and the Humanitarian\nTrust, which are specifically for fourth year"},"145":{"dur":6,"text":"PhD students. You can also use charities to\nfund research, travel and conference expenses;"},"151":{"dur":4,"text":"those kind of extra costs that you might incur\nduring your Masters and PhD. They might be"},"155":{"dur":3,"text":"a few thousand pounds maybe per year, they\nmight be more than that and there are some"},"159":{"dur":5,"text":"charities and trusts which exist explicitly\nto fund those additional kind of courses rather"},"165":{"dur":5,"text":"than say fees and maintenance which I suppose\nare your core course costs."},"171":{"dur":5,"text":"So learning how to win these grants from charities\ncan be a really useful back-up option for"},"176":{"dur":5,"text":"you. Now what I'm going to go through in this\nvery very brief talk, which is only ever going"},"182":{"dur":3,"text":"to be a whistle-stop tour, is I'm going to\nsay a little bit more introducing these alternative"},"185":{"dur":5,"text":"funding bodies, I'm then going to tell you\nhow to find them and I'm then going to show"},"190":{"dur":3,"text":"you how to initially approach them with an\nemail or letter to make sure that you are"},"194":{"dur":5,"text":"eligible to apply to them and then how to\napply to them and some tips I guess for applying"},"200":{"dur":5,"text":"in the strongest fashion. I should say that\nthis whole talk is based upon a book called"},"206":{"dur":4,"text":"'The Alternative Guide to Postgraduate Funding',\nwhich was the picture of the book that you"},"210":{"dur":5,"text":"saw in the introduction slide. Now, you can\nget hold of a free CD version of 'The Alternative"},"216":{"dur":3,"text":"Guide to Postgraduate Funding', if you haven't\nalready got one today, from the reception"},"220":{"dur":3,"text":"at the Aston Webb Building -- that's the main\nbuilding where there will be a pile of these"},"223":{"dur":4,"text":"CDs here and that will have a pdf version\nof 'The Alternative Guide to Postgraduate"},"228":{"dur":6,"text":"Funding, 2013-2014' there. So by all means,\nyou know, go and scoop up a copy of this book"},"234":{"dur":5,"text":"and take advantage of the fact that the university\nis effectively offering it for free. That"},"240":{"dur":3,"text":"book has everything that I'm talking about\nin this talk and also quite a bit more that"},"243":{"dur":3,"text":"obviously I couldn't fit in."},"247":{"dur":4,"text":"Now when I talk about alternative funding\nsources, I'm principally talking about charities,"},"252":{"dur":3,"text":"foundations and trusts. These words are pretty\nmuch interchangeable I suppose as far as we're"},"255":{"dur":5,"text":"concerned and what they are, are simply bodies\nwhich were set up and sustained by private"},"260":{"dur":5,"text":"individuals for all manner of reasons. You\nmight have some for example which are there"},"266":{"dur":4,"text":"to promote educational courses like the Sir\nRichard Stapley Educational Trust or the St"},"270":{"dur":4,"text":"Clement Danes Educational Foundation. You\nmay have some actually that are restricted"},"274":{"dur":5,"text":"to specific student groups. So, for example,\nsome charities actually care about, for example,"},"280":{"dur":4,"text":"what your parents or even your grandparents,\nactually did for a living. So for example"},"284":{"dur":3,"text":"there's one charity called the Leverhulme\nTrades Charities Trust which will give you"},"287":{"dur":5,"text":"up to \u00a35,000 a year for postgraduate study\nif you are the son or daughter or grandson"},"293":{"dur":6,"text":"or granddaughter of a grocer, a travelling\nsalesman or a pharmacist. With that particular"},"299":{"dur":3,"text":"trust I actually got some funding from that\nbecause my father used to sell biscuits in"},"302":{"dur":7,"text":"Grimsby in the 1970s. So that's an example\nof the kind of level of obscurity you can"},"310":{"dur":5,"text":"sometimes run into. The Vegetarian Charity\nfor example only funds vegetarian and vegan"},"315":{"dur":6,"text":"students. Again, really really surprising,\nwhy would somebody back something of that"},"321":{"dur":4,"text":"kind? There's a pub in Kent which has a charity\nassociated with it which gives out for all"},"326":{"dur":4,"text":"of the students who live within a 7.1 mile\nradius of the second bar on the ground floor."},"331":{"dur":3,"text":"That's another very very weird one. And the\nweirdest one of all which is completely mad"},"335":{"dur":3,"text":"is called the Royal Golf Charitable Trust\nwhich is run by a man on a golf course in"},"338":{"dur":3,"text":"Scotland and you can go to the golf course\nand if you defeat him at a round of golf he"},"342":{"dur":3,"text":"gives you \u00a35,000. [laughing] This is true.\nI know it sounds like something in a video"},"346":{"dur":3,"text":"game. He's never been defeated because he's\nreally awesome. That said, they're not all"},"350":{"dur":4,"text":"mad, I just told you some of the mad ones\nto entertain you before lunch. A lot of them"},"354":{"dur":4,"text":"are a lot more standardised like the Stapley\nTrust, the Sidney Perry Foundation, Roger"},"358":{"dur":4,"text":"and Sarah Bancroft Clark Charitable Trust\nwhich will more or less consider any postgraduate"},"363":{"dur":3,"text":"applicant. There you go, there's the Stapley\nTrust that I mentioned, the Vegetarian Charity"},"367":{"dur":3,"text":"and the Leverhulme Trades Charities Trust."},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"So I guess the question is, you know, why\nwould you want to apply to this kind of alternative"},"374":{"dur":4,"text":"funding? Well, this is definitely a Plan B,\nno question about that. If you can land, say,"},"379":{"dur":4,"text":"a full studentship which will pay all of our\nfees, all of your maintenance, that is clearly"},"383":{"dur":5,"text":"the best thing for you to get. This kind of\nfunding is not as comprehensive as that. We're"},"388":{"dur":6,"text":"probably talking about much smaller awards\nfrom here. Also you might use this kind of"},"395":{"dur":5,"text":"funding because your research costs, for example\ntravel and conferences, you may not know what"},"400":{"dur":5,"text":"they are and you may run into additional costs.\nAlso again maintenance things like independent"},"406":{"dur":6,"text":"living, obviously rent, food, that kind of\nthing, again not necessarily possible to predict,"},"413":{"dur":3,"text":"especially when you are a prospective student\nand haven't arrived at a university yet. And"},"416":{"dur":4,"text":"then of course there's the great unquantifiable\nwrite-up costs. Will you finish a PhD in three"},"421":{"dur":5,"text":"years or will it probably go into a fourth\nyear like many PhDs do?"},"426":{"dur":6,"text":"I would have said that in the voluntary sector\nthey really are not at all like Research Councils"},"432":{"dur":6,"text":"and other kind of formal funding that you\nwill have probably come across before. Obviously"},"438":{"dur":3,"text":"Research Councils, things like the AHRC or\nthe ESRC which you probably have already heard"},"442":{"dur":4,"text":"about today at the earlier postgraduate funding\ntalk, have very very strict requirements."},"447":{"dur":6,"text":"You have to apply a long time in advance and\nthey're very academic in their nature. But"},"454":{"dur":3,"text":"these charities and trusts though, there are\nthousands of bodies, from really big ones"},"457":{"dur":4,"text":"-- for example like Oxfam to the British Heart\nFoundation to the Welcome Trust -- down to"},"462":{"dur":4,"text":"really really small ones which are probably\njust run by a few volunteers at weekends from"},"466":{"dur":5,"text":"a farmhouse for example and these small bodies,\nthere are many many more of the small bodies,"},"471":{"dur":4,"text":"are probably the ones that you will be looking\nat when you come to look at this for postgraduate"},"476":{"dur":1,"text":"funding."},"478":{"dur":3,"text":"Now what about how much you can get? Well\nobviously these charities have got varying"},"481":{"dur":5,"text":"budgets. Probably per award we're talking\nabout something like \u00a3500 to \u00a32,000. Some"},"487":{"dur":4,"text":"of them are bigger, for example the Leverhulme\nTrades Charities Trust, but the really really"},"491":{"dur":4,"text":"good thing about these charities and trusts\nis that you can win multiple awards. You can"},"495":{"dur":4,"text":"build up a basketful of them. Once you've\nwon one it's actually easier to win two, to"},"499":{"dur":5,"text":"win three, to win many and so there's a snowball\neffect. Also you can win them for each year"},"505":{"dur":5,"text":"of your PhD for example. I guess part-time\nMasters, you know, a two year Masters course."},"511":{"dur":5,"text":"So that \u00a31,000 in year one might be \u00a32,000\nin year two, \u00a33,000 in year three, \u00a34,000"},"517":{"dur":4,"text":"in year four etc. They're also not always\nacademic. Some of them just help members of"},"521":{"dur":4,"text":"the general public. You might be competing\nagainst a charity which helps a residents'"},"526":{"dur":6,"text":"association fix some swings or someone doing\nan NVQ in brick laying and obviously your"},"533":{"dur":4,"text":"application to do a PhD or Masters at Birmingham\nmight go alongside that. I mentioned that"},"538":{"dur":4,"text":"they've got pretty weird eligibility criteria\nsome of them and they really vary."},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"There's also of course another area which\nare professional bodies and learned societies,"},"546":{"dur":5,"text":"things like the Royal Historical Society and\nthe Society for Neuroscience, which can help"},"552":{"dur":4,"text":"with conference costs and so on and so forth.\nBut they are very diverse and hopefully there"},"556":{"dur":4,"text":"will be something for everyone here. Also\ncharities are flexible. They usually have"},"560":{"dur":4,"text":"many deadlines per year -- sometimes four,\nsometimes six, sometimes twelve -- where the"},"564":{"dur":5,"text":"trustees meet. And you can also, as I said\nbefore, apply in advance or during your course."},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"Now what about finding charities and trusts?\nWell, there are a variety of ways that you"},"573":{"dur":5,"text":"can go about that but the main methodology\nI think is to try and spread the net as far"},"579":{"dur":6,"text":"as you can, try and get like a pad of paper\nand try and find as many charities that you"},"585":{"dur":4,"text":"think you will be eligible for at first instance,\nbecause the amount of information that there"},"589":{"dur":4,"text":"is available on charities via books and via\nthe internet, is not always complete. You"},"594":{"dur":3,"text":"may actually find that many charities which\nlook perfect for you, you're not actually"},"597":{"dur":4,"text":"eligible for. So what you need to do at first\nis to make, say, a long list of charities"},"602":{"dur":4,"text":"you think you're eligible for and then send\nthem a letter or email to make sure, and I'll"},"606":{"dur":4,"text":"come to that in a minute. Don't discount a\ncharity that you find however in a book or"},"611":{"dur":5,"text":"the internet unless it's obviously inappropriate\nbecause many are quite flexible. But the one"},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"thing you should be wary of when you look\nfor charities is make sure they make awards"},"619":{"dur":5,"text":"to individuals. Most charities do not. Most\ncharities only make awards to organisations"},"625":{"dur":4,"text":"and you will almost certainly be applying\nas an individual."},"629":{"dur":4,"text":"So where can you look for charities? Well\nthe first place is online using a variety"},"634":{"dur":4,"text":"of internet sites. Obviously look at Birmingham's\nfunding pages, you've probably already thought"},"639":{"dur":4,"text":"of that. Also look at the charities list in\nthe 'The Alternative Guide to Postgraduate"},"643":{"dur":4,"text":"Funding', that publication I mentioned. That\nhas a list in the purple pages at the back"},"648":{"dur":4,"text":"of over 400 charities and trusts which have\nbeen sourced by me and my team which make"},"652":{"dur":4,"text":"awards to postgraduate study. That might be\nan absolutely ideal place to start and if"},"656":{"dur":3,"text":"you're not looking to raise such a large amount\nof money, you might get everything you need"},"660":{"dur":5,"text":"conceivably just through that list. You can\nalso look on a variety of other websites."},"665":{"dur":4,"text":"The URLs for these are all in the Alternative\nGuide by the way. Postgraduate studentships,"},"669":{"dur":4,"text":"the general funders' section, not the main\nsection. Scholarship search, although that's"},"674":{"dur":4,"text":"not that useful. RD funding, Research and\nDevelopment funding, especially the long-shot"},"678":{"dur":4,"text":"section, Unigrants which is really really\ngood for charities that are specific to subjects,"},"683":{"dur":4,"text":"and charities that are specific to postcodes.\nResearch professional, which is a resource"},"687":{"dur":4,"text":"that the university here at Birmingham subscribes\nto, that's great for research, travel and"},"691":{"dur":4,"text":"conference costs and also the British Council\nmaybe, especially if you are an international"},"696":{"dur":4,"text":"student. You can also look at charity search\nengines as well. These are search engines"},"701":{"dur":4,"text":"set up for members of the public, not necessarily\nstudents. By far the best one in this category"},"705":{"dur":6,"text":"is called Turn To Us. You can also look in\nyour local library as well. There are a variety"},"712":{"dur":5,"text":"of really interesting books that you will\nbe able to find there. So they're the titles"},"717":{"dur":3,"text":"of those. Also you have the Charities Digest\nas well and there are a variety of other books"},"721":{"dur":4,"text":"that you might well find in your local library\nwhen you come to look for this. Just have"},"725":{"dur":4,"text":"a look and ask the librarian to show you where\nthey are and they'll all be there. I think"},"730":{"dur":6,"text":"it's actually a legal requirement for most\npublic libraries to hold copies of these books."},"737":{"dur":4,"text":"There are also local books on charities as\nwell that you might find, like if you go and"},"741":{"dur":3,"text":"look in, I don't know, Birmingham Selly Oak\nor something like that, you know, you might"},"745":{"dur":7,"text":"find some local books that relate to that.\nThere's also the learned societies I mentioned,"},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"things like the Society for Neuroscience,\nRoyal Historical Society, Royal Society of"},"756":{"dur":5,"text":"British Artists, London Mathematical Society.\nYou're probably familiar with some of those."},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"They're interested generally in promoting\na specific area of research and they're great"},"765":{"dur":4,"text":"for conferences and research costs. You can\nfind those actually just by Googling the name"},"770":{"dur":4,"text":"of your subject with Royal Society and you\nmight get a few leads like that."},"775":{"dur":5,"text":"But hopefully having looked on the internet\nand looked in the library you will have then"},"780":{"dur":4,"text":"built up quite a large number of charities\nyou think you're eligible for, but you can"},"784":{"dur":4,"text":"still get quite a few more by asking for advice.\nYou can ask some people called the Educational"},"788":{"dur":4,"text":"Grants Advisory Service, or EGAS. The URL\nis again in the Alternative Guide, you can"},"792":{"dur":6,"text":"just Google EGAS and you can write to them\nwith some biographical details about yourself"},"798":{"dur":4,"text":"and they can send you a list of potential\nfunders that they think you're eligible for,"},"803":{"dur":4,"text":"which is fairly useful. Also you can have\na look at the educational division of your"},"807":{"dur":6,"text":"local council as well. Sometimes local councils\nact as the trustees to charities which, I"},"814":{"dur":3,"text":"suppose, have fallen into disrepair. Maybe\ntheir trustees have died or they've moved"},"817":{"dur":4,"text":"onto something else and the grant-making powers\nare absorbed by the local charity. You could"},"822":{"dur":4,"text":"also even write to the clerk of your local\nparish council. Parish councils are the smallest"},"827":{"dur":3,"text":"units of local Government in England, they\nexist in about a third of postcodes in England"},"830":{"dur":4,"text":"and Wales. Sometimes, rarely, they have money\nthey might be prepared to give away and the"},"834":{"dur":5,"text":"way you found out about those guys is ask\nyour local council, ask the general enquiries"},"840":{"dur":4,"text":"team, tell them what your postcode is and\nask them for contact details of your parish"},"844":{"dur":5,"text":"council, if you've got a parish council. So\nthat's another line of enquiry and then obviously"},"849":{"dur":4,"text":"of course, you know, just simply ask at your\ndepartment as well. There are many, many ways"},"854":{"dur":1,"text":"of finding out about these things."},"856":{"dur":3,"text":"So, you've got this big list now, what are\nyou going to do with it? Well, you've got"},"860":{"dur":4,"text":"to try and make sure that you are actually\neligible for these charities before you apply"},"864":{"dur":4,"text":"to them. So what you've got to do is you've\ngot to write an initial letter or email of"},"868":{"dur":3,"text":"enquiry, or give them a phone call of course\nif they have a number. This letter should"},"872":{"dur":3,"text":"be very simple. Just state your name, your\ncourse and that you're looking to overcome"},"875":{"dur":4,"text":"a deficit in your funding package in this\nparticular programme. An example of what an"},"879":{"dur":4,"text":"initial letter of enquiry looks like can be\nfound on page 72, I believe, of the Alternative"},"884":{"dur":4,"text":"Guide to Postgraduate Funding, but it should\nbe very short and is not the place to advance"},"889":{"dur":6,"text":"complicated arguments about your research.\nIt's really just simply to give them enough"},"895":{"dur":6,"text":"information to decide whether you are eligible\nor not. Make it polite, short and certain-sounding"},"902":{"dur":5,"text":"and also be prepared to send out quite a lot\nof letters. In my case I probably sent out"},"907":{"dur":4,"text":"over a hundred. You don't necessarily need\nto go that far but the more you send out,"},"912":{"dur":3,"text":"the more potential leads you will get."},"916":{"dur":5,"text":"When you send out letters in the post though,\nalways be careful to include a stamped self-addressed"},"921":{"dur":4,"text":"envelope. That's just an envelope with your\naddress on it and sufficient postage to pay"},"925":{"dur":5,"text":"for maybe six or eight sheets of paper that\nare folded. Probably an A5 envelope is ideal."},"931":{"dur":3,"text":"Obviously if they have an email address you\ncan use that but many charities, shall we"},"934":{"dur":5,"text":"say, exist or are run by people from the pre-internet\ngeneration, shall we say, and so consequently"},"940":{"dur":6,"text":"often do not have websites or email addresses.\nBut what I would say is send out all of those"},"947":{"dur":4,"text":"things -- emails, letters and stuff -- then\nawait results. Lots of charities will not"},"951":{"dur":5,"text":"reply to you. Probably 40%, 50% won't. Of\nthose who do reply to you, lots of them will"},"957":{"dur":4,"text":"go and whip out some eligibility criteria\nthat you weren't aware of and you won't be"},"961":{"dur":6,"text":"eligible. Some of them will say they only\nfund organisations and not individuals and"},"967":{"dur":3,"text":"then others may simply say that we don't have\nany money at the moment and we're not giving"},"970":{"dur":7,"text":"any grants. But, from those that do actually\nget back to you and invite you to apply, you"},"977":{"dur":4,"text":"have a pretty good chance in most cases of\nactually getting an award from those bodies."},"981":{"dur":4,"text":"With charities and trusts, the real challenge\nis finding them and getting them to invite"},"985":{"dur":4,"text":"you to apply to them, not so much actually\napplying to them, like it is with these other"},"990":{"dur":4,"text":"scholarships that you've heard about before\nfrom Research Councils for example, which"},"994":{"dur":4,"text":"are very well known about but hugely competitive.\nWith charities it's the opposite. Charities"},"998":{"dur":4,"text":"are not so competitive but are very very obscure."},"1002":{"dur":3,"text":"Now hopefully when you get some application\nforms you need to now decide what to do with"},"1006":{"dur":3,"text":"them. You need to decide how you're going\nto fill them in to give yourself the best"},"1010":{"dur":5,"text":"chance of success. So fill in each section\nvery carefully, obviously, and decide what"},"1016":{"dur":3,"text":"a charity's priority is, whether it's your\nresearch, whether it's the benefit to the"},"1020":{"dur":4,"text":"wider society which many charities are interested\nin, or whether they're interested in, I guess,"},"1024":{"dur":4,"text":"in your kind of career progression.
