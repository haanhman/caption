through"},"259":{"dur":2,"text":"some of the issues that\npeople have with Dragon"},"261":{"dur":1,"text":"and to help get you started in solving"},"263":{"dur":1,"text":"some of those problems."},"265":{"dur":1,"text":"I spoke to our support guys and asked"},"267":{"dur":1,"text":"them for a list of their top issues,"},"268":{"dur":1,"text":"just to get things going."},"270":{"dur":3,"text":"And they gave me, I think,\ntop six support issues"},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"for the Windows product."},"275":{"dur":1,"text":"And as you can

do first\nis just go through these"},"298":{"dur":1,"text":"pretty quickly,"},"299":{"dur":2,"text":"and take you through the\ntroubleshooting that a support guy"},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"would go through when they\nwould try to sort this out."},"305":{"dur":1,"text":"Sound good, Gary?"},"307":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yep, no problem at all."},"308":{"dur":1,"text":"- Okay."},"309":{"dur":1,"text":"So, first one."},"311":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Unable to dictate into\na specific program.\""},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"And typically this will be something"},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"like a Microsoft Office\napplication where you've been"},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"working with Word, perhaps, or Outlook,"},"319":{"dur":2,"text":"and suddenly dictation\nhas stopped working."},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"So what do we do then?"},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"First of all, check that\nthe hardware is working."},"326":{"dur":3,"text":"And make sure that your\naudio system is working,"},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"that you can actually\nget audio into the system"},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"separate to the Dragon environment."},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"Check then whether you can\ndictate into DragonPad."},"337":{"dur":3,"text":"DragonPad is the built-in word processor"},"340":{"dur":1,"text":"that comes with Dragon."},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"And, third, check the dictation source."},"345":{"dur":1,"text":"This where you tell your profile"},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"you're actually dictating\nfrom is actually the same"},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"as the hardware that you're talking in to."},"351":{"dur":3,"text":"So you might be talking\ninto a headset microphone,"},"355":{"dur":3,"text":"for example, but your audio\nmight really be coming from"},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"the built-in microphone in your laptop."},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"And Dragon doesn't do a very good job"},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"in those circumstances."},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"Then probably the most\nfrequent thing to do"},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"is to disable and\nre-enable the Dragon add-in"},"372":{"dur":3,"text":"that's being inserted\ninto the Microsoft app"},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"that you're using to enable the connection"},"378":{"dur":1,"text":"with NaturallySpeaking."},"379":{"dur":1,"text":"How do we go about doing that, Gary?"},"381":{"dur":2,"text":"Do you remember how to get\ninto Word, for example,"},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"and disable and re-enable the add-in?"},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"- Basically,\n- It depends"},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"- when you load most of\nthe Office applications,"},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"there's a, let me remind myself the points"},"395":{"dur":1,"text":"on my screen here."},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"There's, if you go into the Home menu,"},"399":{"dur":3,"text":"in the Tools, and File menu,"},"402":{"dur":1,"text":"Options."},"406":{"dur":1,"text":"On the left-hand side of the Options,"},"408":{"dur":1,"text":"there is an add-in sensor."},"410":{"dur":1,"text":"And, generally speaking,\nany add-ins you have"},"412":{"dur":1,"text":"are mentioned there."},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"And more often than not, if\nyou encounter any issues,"},"416":{"dur":3,"text":"any of our add-ins are\nmarked as inactive there."},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"So you go down to the\nbottom of that screen"},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"and re-enable it."},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's basically on the\nFile menu and Options"},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"you can follow through to any add-ins."},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"- Okay, so those add-ins\nprovide an interface"},"431":{"dur":3,"text":"between the Office app and\nDragon NaturallySpeaking,"},"435":{"dur":1,"text":"or Dragon, as it's now known."},"436":{"dur":2,"text":"So you just need to turn that\noff, turn it back on again,"},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"make sure that it's installed\nand that it's working fine."},"441":{"dur":1,"text":"Number two on the list, 'cause\nwe're gonna go through these"},"443":{"dur":1,"text":"at a fairly rapid pace,"},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"because we have a lot to get through."},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"So dictation isn't working."},"448":{"dur":3,"text":"So the most frequent\nreason this is happening"},"451":{"dur":3,"text":"is that an incorrect dictation\nsource has been selected."},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"So in that case, again,\nsame sort of story."},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"Check that that hardware is working."},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"Check whether or not you\ncan dictate into DragonPad,"},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"and make sure that the dictation source"},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"matches the actual hardware."},"466":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's a more straightforward problem"},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"that doesn't involve\nthe application add-ins"},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"if you're dealing with Office."},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"The third one, much more straightforward."},"473":{"dur":3,"text":"You've bought an upgrade online, say,"},"477":{"dur":3,"text":"and you haven't been able to\ndownload from Digital River."},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"Perhaps there were network issues."},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"Or perhaps you've lost the download"},"484":{"dur":1,"text":"and you need to get it back again"},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"or re-install the software\nbecause you've lost"},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"the original installation software."},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"In that case, support guys\nwill actually help you"},"493":{"dur":3,"text":"with a download link so that\nyou can download the software"},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"again, or for the first time."},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"If necessary they may refer\nyou back to Digital River"},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"for some clarification on\nlicensing or something like that."},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"Number four."},"506":{"dur":1,"text":"This has been a little\nbit of a frequent one"},"508":{"dur":1,"text":"I think in the last 12 months."},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"Installation hangs or stops responding."},"512":{"dur":3,"text":"In this case, typically you're using a DVD"},"516":{"dur":1,"text":"to do the installation."},"518":{"dur":1,"text":"And the usual problem\nfor that sort of issue"},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"is an issue with the drive."},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe the drive is slightly out of spec,"},"523":{"dur":1,"text":"or it's very slow,"},"525":{"dur":3,"text":"or there's a defective\nDVD that's causing issues"},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"reading the information\nthat's on the DVD drive."},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"Troubleshooting there is,\nagain, support can provide"},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"you with a download link."},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"Or if you're in a location\nwhere you don't have"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"enough bandwidths to do the download,"},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"they can provide replacement media"},"542":{"dur":1,"text":"and organize that for you."},"544":{"dur":1,"text":"- It's probably worth pointing out"},"545":{"dur":3,"text":"in the initial version of\nDragon 13, there was a known bug"},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"with the product,"},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"but that was soon sorted"},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"and any media that's out\nthere in the world now"},"555":{"dur":3,"text":"should install without any further issues."},"558":{"dur":1,"text":"But as Derek's saying,"},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"it's probably prudent to\ncontact the support team"},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"as they will have an answer for it."},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, that was a very"},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"painful bug for about a week or two"},"569":{"dur":1,"text":"when Dragon 13\n- Yes."},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"- was first released October last year."},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was fixed very quickly,\n- Yeah."},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"- I think within two, three weeks."},"578":{"dur":3,"text":"But there are still a few\nproduction DVD's out there"},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"that were the original\npressing of the DVD."},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you've got that sort\nof problem, contact support"},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"and they'll be able to\nhelp you sort that out."},"591":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, another one."},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"User files can't be accessed\nwhen opening a user profile."},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"This one has come up in the\nquestions tonight as well."},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"So in that case, the application\nDragon will no longer open."},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"The process there is,\nand you may need help"},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"with support to do this, is check your"},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"user account permissions\nand make sure that"},"608":{"dur":4,"text":"your account has full\ncontrol on the user folder."},"612":{"dur":3,"text":"And then restore or\ncreate a new user profile"},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"before rebooting and logging\nin to that Windows account"},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"to make sure you've got\naccess to the folder"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"so that Dragon can\nactually put information"},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"into that and read it back again."},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"- Okay, another thing on that"},"629":{"dur":1,"text":"is that sometimes,"},"632":{"dur":1,"text":"I did this initially,"},"634":{"dur":1,"text":"sometimes you think you're\nbeing kind of a bipe"},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"setting your profile in\none of these cloud services"},"637":{"dur":1,"text":"such as OneDrive or Dropbox."},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"It's not necessarily the\ncorrect way of going forward"},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"because, of course, if it's on the cloud,"},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"other services are potentially accessing"},"647":{"dur":1,"text":"the file at the same time."},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"So try and leave your profile in a folder"},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"that won't be accessed by a cloud service"},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"at the same time."},"655":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, so in that case\nyou've got several things"},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"trying to access the profile\n- Certainly."},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"- at the same time and it\ncan get quite interesting."},"662":{"dur":1,"text":"particularly because Dragon will need to"},"664":{"dur":1,"text":"have write access to that information."},"666":{"dur":1,"text":"If you're changing it\nall the time you'll have"},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"updates happening frequently."},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"The last one on the\nWindows top issues list"},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"is that your activations\nhave been exceeded."},"677":{"dur":3,"text":"So each version of Dragon\nallows you do a certain number"},"680":{"dur":4,"text":"of installation of the software\nbefore you need to increase"},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"the numbers of activations\nthat you're allowed."},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"The licenses, for example,\nwith professional,"},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"you can install Dragon, it's licensed"},"691":{"dur":1,"text":"by profile, by speaker."},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you've got three\nlaptops or 14 laptops,"},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"you're licensed to install\nthat on all of the laptops"},"698":{"dur":3,"text":"but you may need to contact Nuance support"},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"to actually increase the\nnumber of activations"},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"for your software."},"705":{"dur":1,"text":"So support can do that"},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"and give you some advice on\nyour particular situation."},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"And they'll also help you with the EULA,"},"711":{"dur":1,"text":"the End User License Agreement,"},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"if any of that needs clarification."},"716":{"dur":1,"text":"On to Mac."},"717":{"dur":1,"text":"Just two Mac issues to talk about."},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"One is opening a user profile."},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think, Gary, this may also,"},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"you probably don't do much Mac work there,"},"725":{"dur":1,"text":"but I think this was also an early bug"},"727":{"dur":3,"text":"with, particularly local accounts,"},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"local profiles\n- That's right, yeah."},"733":{"dur":1,"text":"- made with Dragon,"},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"where an error message was displayed after"},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"Dragon was opened and\nthe workaround there,"},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"if those of you who've had that problem."},"742":{"dur":1,"text":"I know a few of you've had that."},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"The workaround is to\ncreate a new user profile."},"746":{"dur":1,"text":"Delete the old one,"},"748":{"dur":1,"text":"and then make sure you update"},"749":{"dur":4,"text":"to the Service Pack 5.0.2, version 5.0.2,"},"754":{"dur":3,"text":"and that should solve\nthat problem for you."},"757":{"dur":2,"text":"So those are the most frequent problems."},"760":{"dur":1,"text":"Oh, sorry, number two."},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm getting ahead of myself."},"763":{"dur":1,"text":"Problems configuring the microphone."},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"This happened a lot with\nversion, Dragon for Mac,"},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"Dragon Dictate version 4 on Mac,"},"770":{"dur":3,"text":"because it was a little\nbit confusing as to how"},"773":{"dur":3,"text":"the control, the settings\nin the Apple menu"},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"actually worked in\nconjunction with Dragon."},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you've got problems\ngetting the audio to work,"},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"again, similar to how you\nwould do it on Windows,"},"785":{"dur":1,"text":"check that the hardware's working,"},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"check that you can dictate into DragonPad"},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"and confirm that the dictation\nsource in the profile"},"791":{"dur":2,"text":"actually matches the hardware."},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"Now this in the latest\nversion of Dragon for Mac,"},"796":{"dur":1,"text":"this is all much more straightforward"},"798":{"dur":2,"text":"and much easier to work out."},"800":{"dur":2,"text":"So that concludes the most common problems"},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"that we've had from support."},"805":{"dur":2,"text":"What's we're going to do now"},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"is turn to a whole series of questions"},"810":{"dur":1,"text":"that you guys have sent in."},"812":{"dur":1,"text":"We've got more than"},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"I think about 230 plus people have"},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"signed-up for the broadcast tonight."},"818":{"dur":3,"text":"And about a third of\nyou have sent in issues."},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"I had to draw a line yesterday afternoon."},"824":{"dur":2,"text":"So I stopped at that point yesterday."},"827":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you've signed up for the webinar"},"830":{"dur":3,"text":"after about 3 p.m., 2\np.m. yesterday afternoon,"},"833":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm not gonna have your question in here"},"836":{"dur":1,"text":"but I will look after the event to see"},"837":{"dur":1,"text":"if we can help you with those."},"839":{"dur":1,"text":"What I've done is I've gone through them."},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"I've tried to collate\nones that are similar"},"843":{"dur":1,"text":"so that we can talk about them as a group."},"845":{"dur":3,"text":"And in cases where\nthere's something concrete"},"848":{"dur":1,"text":"that we can do about it straightaway,"},"850":{"dur":1,"text":"I've put it in the slide."},"852":{"dur":1,"text":"Some of the other\nproblems we're going to be"},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"fairly blunt and fast about."},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"We're gonna basically say, \"Call Support.\""},"857":{"dur":2,"text":"So forgive me for doing that tonight."},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"But some of the problems\nare very convoluted"},"862":{"dur":2,"text":"and we'll try and explain\nwhy they're convoluted"},"864":{"dur":1,"text":"as we get to them."},"866":{"dur":2,"text":"So, first question from Gary."},"868":{"dur":1,"text":"Oh, this is an easy one."},"870":{"dur":1,"text":"I'd like to receive upgrade offers."},"872":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm currently using version 13 Premium"},"874":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'd like to update to Professional."},"877":{"dur":2,"text":"So generally here if you\nwould like to receive"},"882":{"dur":2,"text":"offers from Nuance,"},"884":{"dur":2,"text":"you can sign up and register your"},"886":{"dur":1,"text":"product and opt in for

Nuance"},"902":{"dur":2,"text":"and our partners for you as well."},"904":{"dur":2,"text":"So they will be coming\nthrough the pipeline too."},"906":{"dur":2,"text":"So, Gary, I hope that makes

to"},"1356":{"dur":2,"text":"\"have them transcribed with\nDragon, any suggestions?\""},"1359":{"dur":2,"text":"The second one is, \"I hope Dragon"},"1361":{"dur":1,"text":"would transcribe my interviews.\""},"1363":{"dur":1,"text":"And I've added a sad face there."},"1365":{"dur":2,"text":"Because Dragon does not\ntranscribe interviews."},"1367":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm sorry."},"1368":{"dur":2,"text":"It works with one person at a time."},"1370":{"dur":2,"text":"If you want a more efficient way of"},"1373":{"dur":3,"text":"processing interviews, probably"},"1376":{"dur":3,"text":"the best way to do it is\nto re-speak the interview."},"1380":{"dur":2,"text":"So, put a set of headphones on,"},"1382":{"dur":2,"text":"playback the recording of the interview,"},"1384":{"dur":2,"text":"and speak it back into Dragon."},"1387":{"dur":2,"text":"And that will give you a\ntranscript straight away."},"1389":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're doing this for a living,"},"1392":{"dur":2,"text":"there's even specialist software,"},"1394":{"dur":1,"text":"for example something called AudioScribe,"},"1396":{"dur":2,"text":"that again has Dragon embedded in

at."},"1428":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, so, let me talk\nabout Dragon Anywhere,"},"1432":{"dur":2,"text":"which we spoke about at the last event."},"1434":{"dur":2,"text":"Dragon Anywhere is, as Gary\nwas

in the US."},"1472":{"dur":1,"text":"So, if you're in the US, you can actually"},"1474":{"dur":1,"text":"access Dragon Anywhere."},"1476":{"dur":2,"text":"I know a few people in Australia\nare doing that as well."},"1478":{"dur":2,"text":"They're signing up for a subscription"},"1480":{"dur":1,"text":"service on the US servers."},"1482":{"dur":2,"text":"The issues are, as you'd be aware,"},"1484":{"dur":1,"text":"that speech recognition software"},"1486":{"dur":2,"text":"has to be localized for the audience."},"1488":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not like a Microsoft Windows program"},"1490":{"dur":4,"text":"that you can basically\nchange a few ises into izes,"},"1494":{"dur":1,"text":"or vice versa, and you've got it localized"},"1496":{"dur":2,"text":"for British\/Australian\nEnglish from American English."},"1498":{"dur":3,"text":"Speech recognition requires\nadaption for the local accent."},"1502":{"dur":3,"text":"So, at this point, first we don't have"},"1505":{"dur":2,"text":"an Australian accent\nsupport for Dragon Anywhere."},"1508":{"dur":2,"text":"The second issue is\nthat the servers running"},"1510":{"dur":2,"text":"this process are based in the US."},"1513":{"dur":2,"text":"And the latency is a little bit"},"1515":{"dur":2,"text":"longer than we'd like it to be."},"1517":{"dur":3,"text":"And thirdly, there are\nissues with data security."},"1521":{"dur":2,"text":"So the sort of organizations that we"},"1523":{"dur":1,"text":"think might want to use Dragon Anywhere."},"1524":{"dur":2,"text":"So, for example, social\nworkers, finance people,"},"1527":{"dur":3,"text":"lawyers doing file notes, it's important"},"1530":{"dur":2,"text":"that the data is kept in the country."},"1533":{"dur":2,"text":"And we need to provide\na solution for that."},"1535":{"dur":1,"text":"So, we're working on that."},"1537":{"dur":2,"text":"And we hope we'll have\nsome news on that soon."},"1539":{"dur":3,"text":"Dragon, you will need, so to\nanswer the question, Shannon,"},"1542":{"dur":2,"text":"finally, you will need to\nhave Dragon Professional."},"1545":{"dur":2,"text":"Either Dragon Professional

note."},"1629":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean it's quite a powerful feature,"},"1631":{"dur":1,"text":"the synchronization of the auto-texts"},"1633":{"dur":1,"text":"and vocabularies."},"1635":{"dur":1,"text":"I had an instance the other day,"},"1637":{"dur":2,"text":"where I had to start on a new laptop."},"1639":{"dur":1,"text":"Wanted to create a new profile."},"1641":{"dur":3,"text":"I linked to my Dragon Anywhere account,"},"1644":{"dur":2,"text":"and instantly having\ncreated my new profile"},"1647":{"dur":3,"text":"at Dragon Anywhere\npulled the new auto-text"},"1650":{"dur":3,"text":"and vocabulary straight\ninto a brand-new profile."},"1653":{"dur":1,"text":"Which meant that straight\naway, I could use"},"1655":{"dur":3,"text":"commands
