captain\nsays that the ship fell over"},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"and he fell into a boat."},"417":{"dur":3,"text":"But the point was, the news\nhad been reporting it this way"},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"and so the student\nremembered that."},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"So then I said to him, and\nhow did our world respond?"},"426":{"dur":1,"text":"Did our world respond\nby saying, hey,"},"428":{"dur":3,"text":"that was a really brilliant\nchoice of that Captain?"},"432":{"dur":2,"text":"Or did the world\nrespond by saying,"},"434":{"dur":1,"text":"how could he have done that?"},"435":{"dur":1,"text":"And he said, well,\nit was the latter."},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"Our world was saddened\nby that kind of reaction."},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"So then I said,\nlet's contrast that"},"441":{"dur":3,"text":"captain with another captain,\nnot of a cruise ship,"},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"but of an airplane."},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"And I said to this\nstudent, a few years ago--"},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"now this was many years\nago now-- but back in 2012,"},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"a few years prior to\nthat in 2009 there"},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"had been a US

whole\nflock of Canadian geese"},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"that were flying around\nthe exact same flight"},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"pattern as this\nUS airways flight."},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I said to this student,\nas this plane was taking off"},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"and these Canadian geese\nwe're flying nearby,"},"476":{"dur":3,"text":"they got sucked into the\nengines of the airplane"},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"and it caused immediate\nengine failure."},"483":{"dur":1,"text":"Do you remember that,\nI said to this student."},"484":{"dur":1,"text":"He said, yes I do."},"486":{"dur":3,"text":"I said the captain of that\nairplane, Chesley Sullenberger,"},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"realized that he needed\nto make an emergency"},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"landing because if he\ndidn't control the landing"},"494":{"dur":3,"text":"the plane was going to crash\nwith the dual engine failure."},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"And he realized he could\nnot get back to LaGuardia."},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"He couldn't get to Teterboro\nor any of the other surrounding"},"502":{"dur":1,"text":"airports, and so he\nthought, I'm going"},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"to try to do a water landing."},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"And he managed to safely\nland that US airways plane"},"509":{"dur":1,"text":"on the Hudson River\nin what became known"},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"as the miracle on the Hudson."},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"And I said to the student,\nwhen that plane came to a stop"},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"and everyone inside would\nhave gone to the nearest exit"},"518":{"dur":3,"text":"to get off, that meant the\npeople at the back of the plane"},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"would have gone\nto the back exit."},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"But one of the first people\nto get to the back door"},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"didn't realize that the\ntail of the airplane"},"528":{"dur":3,"text":"was tucked in the water, so when\nthey whipped that door open,"},"532":{"dur":3,"text":"the Hudson River starts\nflooding into this airplane."},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"So I said to the\nstudent, now everyone"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"is getting away from\nthe back of the plane"},"541":{"dur":1,"text":"and they're escaping\nout the middle doors"},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"and the front doors,\nand they're getting off."},"545":{"dur":6,"text":"Except for one person,\nCaptain Chesley Sullenberger."},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"As everyone's getting off\nand away from the back,"},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"he's staying on and\nwalking towards the back."},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"And as water was filling the\ncabin about to waist level,"},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"he walked the aisle not\njust once, but twice,"},"562":{"dur":1,"text":"to make sure no one\nwas left on the plane."},"564":{"dur":4,"text":"And he was the last\nperson to get off."},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"What did our world say about\nhim, I asked this student."},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"And he said, a hero."},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"Correct, I said."},"576":{"dur":1,"text":"Why?"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"And he said, well, because\nhe had dependent passengers"},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"and he cared for them."},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"He prioritized their need."},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"He put them ahead of himself."},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"And I said, do you think that's\nan example we should follow?"},"587":{"dur":0,"text":"He said, yes."},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I knew by his\nreaction to that story"},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"that he shared the view I\nhave, that even if we sometimes"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"fail in being\nother-oriented, we know"},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"that that's how we\nought to be, and that's"},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"the example to follow."},"600":{"dur":1,"text":"And so once we can\nestablish that,"},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"I then brought it back\nto the topic of abortion"},"605":{"dur":1,"text":"that we were debating."},"607":{"dur":4,"text":"And I said, if you agree that\nit was correct for the pilot"},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"to put the passengers\nahead of himself,"},"614":{"dur":3,"text":"to prioritize the needs\nof his dependents,"},"617":{"dur":1,"text":"then wouldn't it\nfollow that when"},"619":{"dur":1,"text":"it comes to the\ntopic of abortion"},"621":{"dur":3,"text":"in an unplanned pregnancy\nthat a pregnant woman ought"},"624":{"dur":4,"text":"to prioritize the needs of her\ndependent, her pre-born child,"},"629":{"dur":1,"text":"much like a passenger\nin the airplane who's"},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"in a vulnerable position\nand needs someone who's"},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"more skilled and older\nand capable of helping"},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"them to help them out?"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"Now some people respond\nby saying, well, wait."},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"There's a big difference there."},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"You're comparing\napples to oranges."},"645":{"dur":1,"text":"The people getting\noff of the airplane--"},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"those passengers\nwere human beings."},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"Embryos and fetuses aren't."},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can't make\nthat comparison."},"653":{"dur":5,"text":"And I would suggest that that\ncomparison is valid or invalid"},"659":{"dur":3,"text":"depending on, indeed, whether\nembryos and fetuses are"},"662":{"dur":3,"text":"human beings, like the\npassengers on the airplane."},"666":{"dur":1,"text":"And so in my work\nI often wrestle"},"667":{"dur":1,"text":"with that question\nin conversations"},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"with people, trying to\ndiscern when does life begin."},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"And a good question-- because,\nremembering I love questions--"},"675":{"dur":3,"text":"a good question that I'll\noften ask people is this,"},"678":{"dur":3,"text":"do you believe in human rights?"},"681":{"dur":3,"text":"And I can tell you, I have asked\nthat question around the world,"},"685":{"dur":4,"text":"and consistently I\nget one answer, yes."},"689":{"dur":4,"text":"And if someone believes in human\nrights I then like to say, OK."},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, what about\nthis human's rights"},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"in the case of this\nseven-week embryo?"},"699":{"dur":3,"text":"Now sometimes people will look\nat an image like that and say,"},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"that's not a human."},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"And if that's someone's\nreaction then in conversation"},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"I think rather than\npreaching at an individual,"},"710":{"dur":3,"text":"a good strategy to take\nis to just ask a question."},"713":{"dur":4,"text":"And the question I like to\nask is, what are her parents?"},"718":{"dur":3,"text":"Is the pregnant woman human?"},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"Is her partner human?"},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"If yes, wouldn't\nit logically follow"},"726":{"dur":4,"text":"that their offspring must\nbe of the same species?"},"731":{"dur":1,"text":"So then someone might\nobject and say, well,"},"733":{"dur":5,"text":"even if biologically that's\nhuman, it's not alive."},"738":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, I found myself\nin a conversation"},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"with another college\nstudent a few years ago,"},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"and I asked him what he\nthought about abortion."},"745":{"dur":1,"text":"He said, I'm pro-choice."},"746":{"dur":1,"text":"I said, why are you pro-choice?"},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"And he said, well, because\nthe fetus isn't alive."},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I just asked\nanother question."},"753":{"dur":4,"text":"If the fetus isn't alive, why\ndo you need to do an abortion?"},"758":{"dur":4,"text":"And he stopped and he looked\nat me and he said, huh."},"762":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to talk to you."},"764":{"dur":1,"text":"I never thought of it that way."},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we spent about\n30 minutes engaging"},"767":{"dur":4,"text":"in a friendly, civil dialogue\nas a result of a question."},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"If someone objects to the\nidea that the embryo is alive,"},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"I think another good\nquestion to ask is this,"},"778":{"dur":2,"text":"is the embryo growing?"},"781":{"dur":1,"text":"At the moment of\nfertilization, when"},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"you have a one-celled embryo, is\nthat one cell growing into two,"},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"and are those two growing\ninto four and eight and 16,"},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"And if yes, wouldn't\nit follow by virtue"},"791":{"dur":3,"text":"of the embryo's growth,\nthe embryo must be living?"},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"And if the embryo\nhas human parents,"},"797":{"dur":3,"text":"wouldn't it follow by virtue of\nthat the embryo must be human?"},"801":{"dur":4,"text":"And if we believe in human\nrights then wouldn't it"},"805":{"dur":1,"text":"follow what we\nknow to be a living"},"807":{"dur":4,"text":"human has the same human\nrights as you or me?"},"811":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, someone might object\nat that point and say,"},"813":{"dur":3,"text":"but it's just a fetus,\nor it's just an embryo."},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I think a\ngood question to ask"},"818":{"dur":4,"text":"that I've asked many people\nis this, what kind of fetus?"},"823":{"dur":2,"text":"If you think about that\nterm for a moment, fetus,"},"826":{"dur":1,"text":"that's not species-specific."},"827":{"dur":2,"text":"So other species have fetuses."},"829":{"dur":2,"text":"Dogs have fetuses,\ndolphins have fetuses,"},"832":{"dur":1,"text":"and humans have fetuses."},"833":{"dur":1,"text":"So the word fetus\ndoesn't so much"},"835":{"dur":5,"text":"tell us what something is, but\ntells us how old something is."},"841":{"dur":1,"text":"So again, with my\nlove of questions,"},"842":{"dur":5,"text":"I'll often ask people when a\nfetus is born to human parents"},"847":{"dur":3,"text":"and is in the arms of the\nmother, what do we now"},"851":{"dur":2,"text":"call the fetus at that moment?"},"853":{"dur":1,"text":"And people will\nsay, well, a baby."},"854":{"dur":2,"text":"And then when the baby turns\ntwo, what do we call the baby,"},"857":{"dur":2,"text":"And, toddler, is\nwhat people say."},"859":{"dur":1,"text":"And then when the\ntoddler turns 13,"},"861":{"dur":1,"text":"what do we call the toddler?"},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"I was once giving a talk--\nan elderly woman piped up,"},"865":{"dur":1,"text":"impossible."},"867":{"dur":1,"text":"That's what we call\nthat individual."},"868":{"dur":0,"text":"[CHUCKLES]"},"869":{"dur":3,"text":"And then when impossible turns\n21, what do we call impossible?"},"873":{"dur":2,"text":"Even more impossible, right?"},"875":{"dur":2,"text":"So the point is,\nthat we humans have"},"878":{"dur":3,"text":"words to refer to age\nranges within our species."},"881":{"dur":6,"text":"And so the words adult or\nteenager, toddler, baby, fetus,"},"888":{"dur":5,"text":"and embryo simply tell\nus how old an entity is,"},"893":{"dur":1,"text":"not what an entity is."},"895":{"dur":1,"text":"If we want to know\nwhat that entity is,"},"896":{"dur":2,"text":"we have to ask what\nare the parents."},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, when it comes to the\nabortion debate, one thing"},"902":{"dur":3,"text":"that I have found that\nprovokes a lot of conversation"},"905":{"dur":5,"text":"is defining the exact moment the\nfetus or the embryo came to be."},"911":{"dur":2,"text":"And a lot of times\nwe, as a culture,"},"913":{"dur":4,"text":"will resist the idea that,\nwhen debating abortion,"},"917":{"dur":2,"text":"that life would begin\nat fertilization."},"920":{"dur":1,"text":"And so what I'd\nlike to suggest is"},"921":{"dur":4,"text":"that, if we weren't talking\nabout abortion, we as a society"},"925":{"dur":2,"text":"would more readily accept that\nlife begins at fertilization."},"928":{"dur":1,"text":"In fact, we already do."},"930":{"dur":5,"text":"And a good question to consider\ninvolves this, the following."},"935":{"dur":4,"text":"Imagine someone is not pregnant\nwith an unwanted pregnancy."},"939":{"dur":2,"text":"Imagine they're trying\nto achieve a pregnancy."},"942":{"dur":2,"text":"They desperately\nwant to be pregnant,"},"944":{"dur":2,"text":"but they're struggling\nwith infertility."},"946":{"dur":3,"text":"So imagine this person goes\nto an infertility specialist,"},"949":{"dur":4,"text":"and that
