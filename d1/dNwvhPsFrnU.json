problems."},"62":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, let's solve this\none problem right here."},"65":{"dur":1,"text":"He has several degrees from MIT,"},"67":{"dur":4,"text":"and from some other slightly\nless

clue\nof what Khan Academy is?"},"115":{"dur":2,"text":"Good, that's why we're here."},"118":{"dur":2,"text":"So, those of you who are\nfamiliar with Khan Academy,"},"120":{"dur":1,"text":"you might associate it with\na collection of videos,"},"122":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'll talk about how\nall that got started."},"124":{"dur":1,"text":"But what we'll hopefully appreciate"},"125":{"dur":1,"text":"over the course of this presentation,"},"126":{"dur":3,"text":"that it is much, much\nmore that just videos."},"130":{"dur":1,"text":"But just to get everyone on the same page,"},"131":{"dur":2,"text":"I will start with a little sample of what"},"133":{"dur":3,"text":"at least the videos look like."},"137":{"dur":1,"text":"are just through the

this?"},"145":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Voiceover] Excellent question, LeBron."},"146":{"dur":2,"text":"- [Voiceover] And you can\njust see the pleasure he had."},"149":{"dur":0,"text":"- [Voiceover] Can you determine"},"150":{"dur":1,"text":"which light bulb is being switched?"},"151":{"dur":2,"text":"- [Voiceover] Things\nactually can interbreed,"},"154":{"dur":1,"text":"although for these two in

numbers"},"159":{"dur":1,"text":"and see what kind of\ncolors I can come up with."},"161":{"dur":3,"text":"- [Voiceover] If this\ndoes not blow your mind,"},"164":{"dur":1,"text":"then you have no emotion."},"166":{"dur":3,"text":"(audience laughing)"},"170":{"dur":3,"text":"- I thought Euler's identity\nwould go well with all of you."},"174":{"dur":4,"text":"As I mentioned, it's much,\nmuch more than just videos."},"179":{"dur":3,"text":"What you see here, this is\nour kind of adaptive software,"},"183":{"dur":2,"text":"where students can go, they\ncan pick their grade level."},"185":{"dur":1,"text":"They can go ahead at their own pace,"},"186":{"dur":1,"text":"they can remediate if they want."},"188":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a whole series of game mechanics,"},"190":{"dur":1,"text":"they get unlimited exercises."},"192":{"dur":1,"text":"These are exercises that are aligned"},"193":{"dur":2,"text":"with what they actually\nhave to learn in school,"},"196":{"dur":1,"text":"and there's all kind of fun badges"},"198":{"dur":2,"text":"and prizes as students progress."},"201":{"dur":0,"text":"And there's much, much more than that,"},"202":{"dur":2,"text":"that's just a small sample."},"204":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, this is just a snapshot\nof where Khan Academy is today."},"208":{"dur":2,"text":"We're being used in\nsome

going,"},"221":{"dur":1,"text":"I wanna rewind a little bit and talk about"},"223":{"dur":2,"text":"how all of this got started."},"225":{"dur":3,"text":"If you go back to 2004, I was\na year out of business school."},"229":{"dur":2,"text":"I was a computer scientist by background,"},"232":{"dur":1,"text":"I came out to silicon Valley,"},"233":{"dur":1,"text":"worked in tech for a little bit."},"234":{"dur":0,"text":"Went back to business school"},"235":{"dur":3,"text":"and in 2004 I was an\nanalyst at a hedge fund."},"239":{"dur":2,"text":"And I had some family\nvisiting me in Boston,"},"241":{"dur":1,"text":"I actually had just gotten married,"},"243":{"dur":1,"text":"and it came out in conversation"},"244":{"dur":3,"text":"that one of my cousins, Nadia,\nwas having trouble in math."},"247":{"dur":1,"text":"She was in 7th grade."},"248":{"dur":1,"text":"Because of her not doing well"},"250":{"dur":2,"text":"on a placement exam in 6th grade,"},"252":{"dur":3,"text":"they were placing her into a\nslow math class in 7th grade."},"255":{"dur":2,"text":"And I immediately said well\nyeah, this is a big deal,"},"257":{"dur":2,"text":"if you get put into\nthat track in 7th grade,"},"259":{"dur":2,"text":"it has all sorts of implications\nof what happens next."},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I talked to Nadia about it."},"264":{"dur":2,"text":"She said \"Yeah, it's unit\nconversion, I just don't get it.\""},"267":{"dur":2,"text":"I said \"Hey, how 'bout when\nyou go back to New Orleans"},"270":{"dur":1,"text":"\"I work with you, I'll tutor you.\""},"272":{"dur":2,"text":"And she was up for it, so we did it."},"274":{"dur":4,"text":"And a long story short, we\nstarted tutoring over the phone"},"279":{"dur":3,"text":"using Yahoo, Doodle or whatever\nwas available back then,"},"283":{"dur":1,"text":"after work for me, after school for her."},"285":{"dur":3,"text":"And slowly but surely,\nshe got unit conversion."},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"Then she got a little bit\ncaught up with her class."},"290":{"dur":2,"text":"Then she actually got a\nlittle bit ahead of her class."},"293":{"dur":4,"text":"And at that point I became\nwhat I call a tiger cousin."},"297":{"dur":2,"text":"(audience laughing)"},"300":{"dur":2,"text":"I called up her school and I said"},"302":{"dur":1,"text":"\"You know, I think Nadia Raymond"},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Should retake that placement\nexam from last year.\""},"307":{"dur":1,"text":"They said \"Who are you?\""},"309":{"dur":2,"text":"I said \"I'm her cousin.\""},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"And they, somewhat surprisingly,\nlet her take that test,"},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"and that same Nadia who was"},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"being placed into a slow math class,"},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"was now being placed into\nthe advanced math class."},"319":{"dur":0,"text":"And so, I thought that was"},"320":{"dur":1,"text":"a pretty neat thing that happened."},"321":{"dur":1,"text":"A little bit of an\nintervention on my part,"},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"I was able to connect with a family member"},"325":{"dur":3,"text":"who lived 1200 miles away,\nand so I was kinda hooked,"},"329":{"dur":1,"text":"and I enjoyed the subject matter"},"330":{"dur":3,"text":"that I wasn't able to do\nin my day job anymore."},"333":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, I started working\nwith her younger brothers,"},"335":{"dur":0,"text":"and then a few things happened"},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"over the next 18 months or so."},"340":{"dur":3,"text":"I worked for a very small firm,\nit was myself and my boss,"},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"and my boss's wife got a position"},"346":{"dur":4,"text":"as a law professor at Stanford,\nand so we moved out here."},"350":{"dur":2,"text":"But more importantly,\nword got around the family"},"353":{"dur":3,"text":"that free tutoring was going on."},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, I found myself\nevery day after work"},"358":{"dur":3,"text":"with about 10, 15 cousins, family friends,"},"362":{"dur":1,"text":"all over the country,"},"363":{"dur":1,"text":"we were trying to do it on speaker phone,"},"364":{"dur":1,"text":"it was really hard to schedule."},"366":{"dur":1,"text":"But even then I saw a common theme"},"368":{"dur":3,"text":"that regardless of whether a given cousin"},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"was an A student, or a B\nstudent, or a C student,"},"373":{"dur":1,"text":"they all had gaps in their knowledge."},"375":{"dur":1,"text":"They might be in algebra,"},"376":{"dur":1,"text":"and they were having trouble in algebra,"},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"not because algebra's hard, but because"},"379":{"dur":3,"text":"they were a little shaky on\nexponents, or on decimals,"},"383":{"dur":1,"text":"or whatever else."},"384":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, I started writing\nsome software for them"},"387":{"dur":0,"text":"to give them practice."},"388":{"dur":1,"text":"And if they didn't know how to do it"},"389":{"dur":1,"text":"it would tell 'em the steps."},"391":{"dur":1,"text":"And then I as their tutor,"},"392":{"dur":1,"text":"I could see what they were working on,"},"394":{"dur":1,"text":"when they were working on things"},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"that I could dig in more\nwhen we got on the phone."},"398":{"dur":1,"text":"And all my friends knew"},"399":{"dur":2,"text":"that I had this crazy tutoring project,"},"402":{"dur":3,"text":"and it was in November of\n2006 I was at a dinner party"},"405":{"dur":1,"text":"and I was showing off this software,"},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"and that software was actually\nthe first Khan Academy."},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"I literally, the domain name was there,"},"411":{"dur":1,"text":"it was almost a bit of a joke,"},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"it was me and my family."},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"It had nothing to do with\nvideos at that point."},"417":{"dur":3,"text":"And over dinner the host,\nhis name's Zuli Ramzan,"},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"a classmate of mine from college,"},"423":{"dur":1,"text":"he said \"Well Sal this is all cool,"},"425":{"dur":3,"text":"\"But how are you actually\nscaling-up your lessons?\""},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"And I say \"Oh Zuli, that's a good point,"},"430":{"dur":1,"text":"\"It's actually very hard.\""},"432":{"dur":1,"text":"What I was able to do with Nadia,"},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"I can't do with 10 cousins,"},"434":{"dur":1,"text":"I feel like I have to repeat things."},"436":{"dur":1,"text":"Even the scheduling is hard."},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"And Zuli says \"Well I have an idea."},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Why don't you record some\nof your lessons as videos"},"442":{"dur":3,"text":"\"And upload them onto\nYouTube for your cousins?\""},"446":{"dur":4,"text":"And I immediately said \"No,\nno, that's a horrible idea."},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"\"YouTube is for cats playing piano.\""},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"(audience laughing)"},"454":{"dur":3,"text":"It is not for serious mathematics."},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"But I went home that weekend,"},"460":{"dur":3,"text":"I got over the idea\nthat it wasn't my idea,"},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"and I decided to give it a shot."},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"And you know, those first\nvideos were just the things"},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"that I saw my cousins\nwere having trouble with."},"472":{"dur":3,"text":"Negative exponents,\nlogarithms, simple equations,"},"476":{"dur":1,"text":"some of the trigonometry,\net ceterea, et cetera."},"477":{"dur":1,"text":"And I started doing more and more of this,"},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"and I started telling my\ncousins, hey, watch this."},"481":{"dur":1,"text":"If you have any requests\nI'll make videos for you,"},"483":{"dur":0,"text":"that way when we get on the phone"},"484":{"dur":1,"text":"we can dig a little bit deeper,"},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"and do more interesting\nproblems, things like that."},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"And after about a month,\nI asked them for feedback,"},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"and they somewhat famously"},"493":{"dur":3,"text":"gave me the backhanded\ncompliment of saying"},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"they like me better on\nYouTube than in person."},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"(audience laughing)"},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"And at first this is counter-intuitive"},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"that they would like the virtual cousin"},"508":{"dur":1,"text":"versus the real one."},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"But when you view it\nfrom their point of view,"},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"it made a lot of sense, and\nwe've all experienced this."},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"You're trying to get your\nhead around a technical,"},"517":{"dur":1,"text":"or any subject, it might\nbe a little intimidating,"},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"it's the first time you're seeing it."},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's someone there,"},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"no matter how non-judgmental\nthey're trying to be,"},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"they're there saying \"Hey,\nit makes sense, right?"},"526":{"dur":0,"text":"\"You get it, right?\""},"527":{"dur":4,"text":"And you feel pressure to say\n\"Yeah, yeah it makes sense.\""},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"Or you're in an algebra class"},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"and you're a little bit foggy on decimals"},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"that you should have\nlearned in 4th or 5th grade,"},"539":{"dur":1,"text":"you're embarrassed, you don't wanna tell"},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"your cousin, or your\nteacher, or your parent."},"543":{"dur":0,"text":"If you're in a calculus class,"},"544":{"dur":2,"text":"you forgot some of your\nalgebra, you're embarrassed."},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"But now it's at your own\ntime, at your own pace,"},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"there's no judgment."},"549":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's worth noting\nthat they weren't saying"},"551":{"dur":4,"text":"that they didn't appreciate\nhaving me in their life,"},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"that was super important and in some ways,"},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"it liberated our conversations\nto be more about that."},"561":{"dur":2,"text":"To be more about, well let's think about"},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"the metacognitive skills\naround mathematics."},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's think about what you might wanna do,"},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"let's think about how it\napplies into the world."},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, I took that as positive feedback,"},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"and I just kept making more, and more,"},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"and more of these videos."},"576":{"dur":3,"text":"And after a few more\nmonths it soon became clear"},"579":{"dur":3,"text":"that people who are not\nmy cousins were watching."},"582":{"dur":3,"text":"And at first, I just started\nto see the view count go up,"},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"and then I started\nseeing comments come in,"},"589":{"dur":3,"text":"and a lot of those early\ncomments were just,"},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"you know this is early 2007 now,"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"a lot of these comments\nwere just simple thank yous."},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"Even that, I thought,\nwas a pretty big deal."},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't how much time\nyou spend on YouTube,"},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"most of the comments are not thank you."},"603":{"dur":3,"text":"(audience laughing)"},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"They're a little bit edgier."},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"But then they got intense."},"613":{"dur":3,"text":"I started getting comments\nand notes on YouTube,"},"616":{"dur":1,"text":"you know that video was the reason"},"617":{"dur":1,"text":"I was able to pass my algebra exam."},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"Or, I was thinking about\ndropping out of high school"},"621":{"dur":3,"text":"until I realized how interesting\nthat part of physics is."},"624":{"dur":3,"text":"Or, I'm retiring from the military"},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"and I wanted to go back to\ncollege but I was afraid to"},"630":{"dur":3,"text":"until I saw those videos,\nand now I'm ready to go"},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"and engage in the mathematics."},"635":{"dur":2,"text":"I remember in the early\ndays I brought my wife over,"},"638":{"dur":1,"text":"this is maybe Spring of 2007,"},"640":{"dur":1,"text":"and I said this is\nunbelievable, look at this note."},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"It was a letter that a mother\nhad written me, and she wrote"},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"that two of her sons had\na learning disability,"},"647":{"dur":1,"text":"and these videos were the only way"},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"that they were able to\nkeep up with their class."},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"And because of that, her\nand her entire family"},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"prayed for me and my\nentire family every night."},"657":{"dur":1,"text":"(audience laughing)"},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"And so you can imagine\nhow especially strange"},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"that that felt for me,\nyou have to remember,"},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"I was working as an\nanalyst at a hedge fund."},"666":{"dur":3,"text":"(audience laughing)"},"669":{"dur":1,"text":"I wasn't used to people praying for me."},"671":{"dur":1,"text":"(audience laughing)"},"673":{"dur":1,"text":"At least in that way."},"675":{"dur":1,"text":"And so, I kept going,"},"678":{"dur":1,"text":"the viewership kept\ngrowing, growing, growing."},"680":{"dur":3,"text":"And by Fall of 2009 I had set it up"},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"as a not-for-profit organization,"},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"and I was convinced that\nthere's something real here."},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"And so my wife and I, I remember\nwe looked at our finances,"},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"we had some savings essentially"},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"for a down payment on\na house, but we figured"},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"well surely I could take a plunge"},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"and maybe try to work on this"},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"and turn it into a real organization."},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was already talking\nto some foundations,"},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"and I was pretty hopeful that\none of them would step up"},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"and give at least enough resources"},"708":{"dur":1,"text":"for me to be able to do it."},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, I took the\nplunge, I quit my day job"},"712":{"dur":4,"text":"to try to set up Khan\nAcademy as a real thing."},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"And anytime you do\nanything entrepreneurial,"},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"whether it's for-profit or not-for-profit,"},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"you almost have to start with\nthat delusional optimism,"},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"where you just assume that\nokay, this makes a lot of sense,"},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"the social return on investment\nhere is through the roof,"},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"surely someone will fund it."},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"But you quickly come\nto terms with reality."},"734":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, you have meeting four or five"},"736":{"dur":1,"text":"with that first funder, and they say"},"737":{"dur":0,"text":"\"Well this is really cool,"},"738":{"dur":1,"text":"\"But it's not exactly what we fund.\""},"740":{"dur":0,"text":"Then you have another meeting,"},"741":{"dur":1,"text":"oh we already allocated\nour budget this year."},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"And after about literally\n20 or 30 of these meetings,"},"746":{"dur":3,"text":"you start to wonder what you've just done."},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"Our first child had just been born,"},"753":{"dur":4,"text":"we were digging into our\nsavings about $5,000.00 a month."},"757":{"dur":1,"text":"I literally did wake up\nin the middle of the night"},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"in cold sweats, just\nlike what have I done?"},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not just my future, I have a family."},"765":{"dur":1,"text":"That down payment on a house was quickly"},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"not becoming a down payment on a house."},"769":{"dur":2,"text":"And so you can imagine, this\nwas probably one of the most,"},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"if not the most, stressful\ntimes of my life."},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was getting a few\nhundred dollars off of PayPal,"},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"people donating five, $10.00."},"779":{"dur":3,"text":"If it was any of you, thank you."},"782":{"dur":1,"text":"But then all of a sudden, May 2010,"},"784":{"dur":2,"text":"so this is nine months\nafter I quit my job,"},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"and I was generally questioning everything"},"789":{"dur":1,"text":"about what I had done,"},"790":{"dur":3,"text":"all of a sudden a\n$10,000.00 donation came in."},"794":{"dur":4,"text":"And so I immediately see who\nit was, her name is Ann Doerr,"},"798":{"dur":2,"text":"and I saw that she was based\nin Palo Alto, she was local,"},"800":{"dur":1,"text":"we were in Mountain View."},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, I immediately\nemailed her and I said"},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Thank you so much for this\nincredibly generous donation."},"807":{"dur":1,"text":"\"This is the largest donation"},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"\"That Khan Academy has ever

laughing)"},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"And Ann immediately emailed back and said"},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Well, I use your site myself.\""},"824":{"dur":1,"text":"I had stuff on the financial\ncrisis and economics,"},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"that she apparently really enjoyed."},"828":{"dur":2,"text":"She was using the site with\nher daughters and she said"},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"\"I'd love to meet up, I'm local,"},"831":{"dur":1,"text":"\"And learn more about what you're doing.\""},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, we met up in downtown Palo Alto,"},"836":{"dur":1,"text":"Indian Buffet Restaurant over lunch,"},"838":{"dur":3,"text":"and Ann asks me \"So,\nwhat's your goal here?\""},"842":{"dur":0,"text":"And I said well, when you fill out"},"843":{"dur":2,"text":"the paperwork with the IRS\nto be a not-for-profit,"},"845":{"dur":1,"text":"there's a part of the form that it says"},"847":{"dur":3,"text":"mission, colon, and they give\nyou about a line and a half."},"850":{"dur":1,"text":"And I filled out"},"851":{"dur":3,"text":"a free world-class education\nfor anyone, anywhere."},"855":{"dur":3,"text":"And Ann said \"Well, that's ambitious."},"858":{"dur":1,"text":"\"How do you see

hey, that's this,\nor that's a prime number,"},"2833":{"dur":2,"text":"or whatever, I wonder\nif that works that way."},"2835":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I think frankly it's\na combination of the two."},"2840":{"dur":3,"text":"The times where it gets\nunhealthy, and you see this a lot,"},"2844":{"dur":2,"text":"and we very much do not wanna be that,"},"2847":{"dur":4,"text":"a lot of ed tech

water it down"},"2874":{"dur":2,"text":"and give 'em that dopamine\neven more frequently."},"2877":{"dur":2,"text":"So, we definitely don't do that."},"2879":{"dur":1,"text":"- So, I wanna pull up a

it."},"2908":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, to be truthful right now"},"2911":{"dur":2,"text":"we have some very baseline things,"},"2913":{"dur":1,"text":"you know even with things\nlike the College Board,"},"2915":{"dur":1,"text":"this is stuff that we have to think about,"},"2916":{"dur":3,"text":"'cause it's a national exam."},"2919":{"dur":2,"text":"And we closed-caption\nthings and things like that,"},"2921":{"dur":4,"text":"but we haven't nailed it for\nany of those use cases yet."},"2928":{"dur":1,"text":"- Next question."},"2931":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's a good one."},"2933":{"dur":1,"text":"- People voted for it, it must be good!"},"2935":{"dur":2,"text":"- What's the most prominent\nproblem in learning"},"2937":{"dur":2,"text":"that you believe is still

think that's one."},"2991":{"dur":3,"text":"I think another one is how\ndo you get the creativity"},"2995":{"dur":4,"text":"of a lot of learning closer\nto the students earlier?"},"3000":{"dur":1,"text":"I often say, judging how well"},"3002":{"dur":1,"text":"someone's gonna be a mathematician"},"3003":{"dur":2,"text":"based on how well they factor\npolynomials in
