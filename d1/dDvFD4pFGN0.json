rapidly -- it's going to\nsignificantly outpace the growth"},"219":{"dur":1,"text":"that we're seeing in\nthe western economies."},"221":{"dur":3,"text":"So Australia's large exposure to\nAsia is

slowed down."},"231":{"dur":2,"text":"It's average over the past\n30 years has been 10 percent,"},"234":{"dur":1,"text":"but we think that\nit's going to slow"},"235":{"dur":1,"text":"down to still

benefit."},"255":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think that's something\nthat's very much worth keeping"},"257":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to talk a little\nbit about what's going"},"259":{"dur":2,"text":"on Asia more brutally\nwithin that section."},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"The second thing I want to\ntouch on is the big story"},"265":{"dur":4,"text":"for the world this year I\nthink is the Federal

things."},"316":{"dur":1,"text":"As I've already mentioned\nour view is"},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"that Australia's mining story\nis slowing down, not collapsing."},"321":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not going

start"},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"to level out after having\nclimbed rather than fall."},"337":{"dur":1,"text":"Mining is still with us."},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"The mining story is still\npart of our growth story."},"341":{"dur":1,"text":"It's just shifting in\nterms of its phase,"},"342":{"dur":1,"text":"and I want to talk a\nlittle bit about that."},"344":{"dur":1,"text":"Along the way I want

headed and why."},"362":{"dur":1,"text":"And that might be\nof some interest."},"363":{"dur":0,"text":"I'll touch on that."},"364":{"dur":1,"text":"The fourth thing I want\nto talk about briefly is"},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"that we do expect that\nlocal growth will rebalance."},"369":{"dur":1,"text":"We think that as the\nmining story slows"},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"down we think the other parts\nof the economy will pick up."},"373":{"dur":1,"text":"The RBA has cut its cash rate"},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"to its lowest level\nin over 53 years."},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"Mortgage rates are at their\nlowest level pretty much"},"379":{"dur":0,"text":"in history."},"380":{"dur":1,"text":"They're starting to\nlift the housing market."},"382":{"dur":1,"text":"And we think that given the bulk"},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"of the Australian economy is\noutside of the mining sector"},"386":{"dur":1,"text":"and is quite exchange rate"},"388":{"dur":2,"text":"and interest rate sensitive\nwe think those other parts are"},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"going to take over\nas drivers of growth"},"393":{"dur":1,"text":"And the fifth which is related"},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"to the title is we think the\nrisk of recession is low,"},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"but it is worth keeping in mind,\nand I'll show you slide of this."},"400":{"dur":3,"text":"If you just did a simple\nunconditional probability"},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"of the story for\nAustralia in terms"},"405":{"dur":1,"text":"of recessions you\nwould say, well,"},"407":{"dur":3,"text":"in the last 52 years we've had\nten years of being in recession."},"411":{"dur":1,"text":"So your simple unconditional\nprobability would tell you"},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"that actually 10 of 52, well,\nthere's a 20 percent

sounds quite high."},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"But you've actually got\nto keep that in mind."},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, of course, that's just\na very simple exercise,"},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"and you can build much\nmore sophisticated models"},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"that make my unconditional\nprobability conditional"},"429":{"dur":0,"text":"on a whole lot of things."},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"But as a starting point it's\nan interesting thing to suggest"},"432":{"dur":2,"text":"that there's a 20\npercent change pretty much"},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"that Australia could be in\nrecession at any point in time."},"436":{"dur":3,"text":"So although we've had a 22 year\nboom we shouldn't necessarily"},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"neglect the fact that\nit's actually possible"},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"that Australia could have\na more significant downturn"},"445":{"dur":0,"text":"at some point."},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"There are some significant\npolicy challenges"},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"that in particular\nface the new government"},"450":{"dur":1,"text":"as they've just arrived."},"451":{"dur":3,"text":"And we'll talk a little bit\nabout that if we have time."},"454":{"dur":1,"text":"I've got to be conscious of time"},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"because I do have way too\nmany slides, and I will skip"},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"through them, I won't\nuse them all."},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"This is a picture of\nChinese GDP growth."},"461":{"dur":4,"text":"I put this up and it\ngoes back to 1994."},"466":{"dur":1,"text":"I put this up because\nI like to demonstrate"},"467":{"dur":1,"text":"that China has cycles as well."},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"Everyone talks about China\nas though it sort of grows"},"471":{"dur":1,"text":"at 10 percent per annum\nand that's what happens"},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"because over the past 30\nyears that's what it's done"},"475":{"dur":0,"text":"on average."},"476":{"dur":1,"text":"But, of course, it\nhas had big cycles."},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"Back in the late 90s\nChina's growth was only"},"480":{"dur":1,"text":"around 7 or 8 percent."},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"It accelerated through\nthe 2000s, got to a peak"},"484":{"dur":1,"text":"of 15 percent which I think --"},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"and actually if you'd been\nwatching this story play"},"488":{"dur":1,"text":"out which I had because I was\nworking at the Central Bank"},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"and running the overseas\neconomy section"},"492":{"dur":1,"text":"when that acceleration\nwas happening,"},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"at the time we thought it\nwas more like 11 or 12."},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"The Chinese have gone back\nand revised their GDP numbers"},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"for those who are\ninterested in that sort"},"500":{"dur":1,"text":"of arcane feature of the data."},"502":{"dur":3,"text":"And it now looks as though they\nwere running at 15 percent."},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"Part of the reason in my view\nat least, not the whole reason,"},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"there are lots of reasons for\nthe global financial crisis"},"510":{"dur":3,"text":"and that's a whole\nacademic exercise in"},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"and of itself that's going\nto take us 10 or 15 years"},"516":{"dur":0,"text":"to sort out I imagine."},"517":{"dur":1,"text":"And even then there\nwill be debates."},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"But a part of the reason\nI think, at least one,"},"521":{"dur":1,"text":"is that the Chinese\neconomy was running to hot."},"523":{"dur":1,"text":"They'd been running\ntoo hot prior"},"524":{"dur":1,"text":"to the global financial crisis."},"526":{"dur":1,"text":"And, of course, it was\nrunning at 15 percent"},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"which is exceptionally rapid."},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"The global financial crisis\narrives, China's growth slows,"},"532":{"dur":1,"text":"it falls dramatically."},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"And then if anyone tells you"},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"that the main reason why\nAustralia got through the period"},"537":{"dur":1,"text":"without the -- the global\nfinancial crisis period"},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"without a recession I\nthink I would highly --"},"541":{"dur":3,"text":"that it's to do with Australia's\npolicy making I would disagree"},"545":{"dur":0,"text":"quite fervently."},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"Yes, Australian policy\nhelped, yes it helped"},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"to have some fiscal stimulus,\nthe currency declining"},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"and the IBA cutting right\nthrough were all very good."},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"But the Chinese delivered\na 5 percent of GDP boost"},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"to their infrastructure\nspending,"},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"and that is what got us through\nthat period in such good shape."},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"You can see it in\ntheir GDP numbers."},"561":{"dur":0,"text":"I'll show you in a moment."},"562":{"dur":1,"text":"You can see it in\ntheir infrastructure"},"563":{"dur":0,"text":"investment numbers."},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"You could see it\non the ground here."},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"You could see commodity\nprices bounce sharply,"},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"iron ore prices,\ncoal prices rose."},"569":{"dur":1,"text":"The mining story didn't stop"},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"through the global\nfinancial crisis."},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"And that really is one of the\nkey reasons why Australia got"},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"through that period without\nhaving two consecutive declines"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"in GDP, two consecutive\nprints of declining GDP"},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"and thus not the technical\ndefinition of a recession."},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"Albeit things did feel a bit\nsoft around that period of time."},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"But Chinese growth\nhas slowed since

further."},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"Our view, our house view\nfor what it's worth is"},"602":{"dur":1,"text":"that Chinese growth looks\nas though it's stabilising."},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"The partial indicators look\nlike they are stabilising"},"608":{"dur":1,"text":"as well, the timely ones."},"609":{"dur":1,"text":"You're seeing it\nreflected in the fact"},"610":{"dur":3,"text":"that the iron ore price\nis back up at $140 a ton"},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"or thereabouts even\nin a soft quarter."},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"Because the third quarter is\nactually a seasonally weak"},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"quarter for iron ore prices."},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think you're seeing signs,\nsome pretty tangible signs,"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"that China's growth is

percent."},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"And, therefore, no great\nsurprise our forecast,"},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"our in house forecast is\nthat Chinese growth will be"},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"about 7 1\/2 percent this year"},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"and about the same\npace into next year."},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"It's worth keeping in mind the\nChinese economy being now

percent."},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"You can see it slowed\noff from them."},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"And then you can see\ninterestingly in 2011"},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"and early 2012 when the\nChinese
