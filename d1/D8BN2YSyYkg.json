So 7,000 okay."},"563":{"dur":10,"text":"So let's do a little bit of math for these local jobs, \nlet's say it's 5,500 it's a weird number\nso you're gonna have to do the math for me."},"574":{"dur":8,"text":"How many hours are you putting into doing that? \nMELINDA: Umm, I put in normally, hold on --"},"582":{"dur":4,"text":"CHRIS: We're probably losing half the audience right now because we're doing a lot of math."},"586":{"dur":3,"text":"But guys stick with me you'll see why we're\ntalking about this okay. We gotta get"},"590":{"dur":4,"text":"into the business of design and part of\nthat is knowing your numbers."},"594":{"dur":6,"text":"MELINDA: 36 - 40 hours hours or what I'm averaging on these branding jobs. \nCHRIS: Okay you know what that average is?"},"601":{"dur":4,"text":"Just give me one number. \nMELINDA: 40 hours. \nCHRIS: 40 hours."},"606":{"dur":11,"text":"So do the math and how much are you getting paid per hour --(MELINDA: 137.50)-- 137.50 perfect. an hour. \nMELINDA: Yes"},"617":{"dur":6,"text":"CHRIS: Okay, have you ever calculated thisbefore? \nMELINDA: Oh yeah I have a spreadsheet for all my branding clients."},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"CHRIS: So you know this? \nMELINDA: Yeah --(CHRIS: Okay)-- I just don't have it pulled up right now."},"627":{"dur":4,"text":"CHRIS: Okay that's fine.

If the project's $500"},"641":{"dur":4,"text":"and you spend ten hours on it that's\nwhat you're effectively getting paid."},"645":{"dur":4,"text":"Not what they're paying you but that's you\nknow that's the rate you're working at"},"650":{"dur":5,"text":"so we need to figure that out. So let's take an average one of these lower tier referrals."},"656":{"dur":6,"text":"That's not a logo, \nbranding job and they're going to pay you $500 or 700 or 800, whatever you wanna say it's going to be."},"663":{"dur":6,"text":"How long does it take for you to typically produce that work? \nMELINDA: I usually break it down to $100 an hour."},"670":{"dur":6,"text":"CHRIS: So you're doing it for\n--(MELINDA: It's rough)-- eight hours?"},"677":{"dur":6,"text":"MELINDA: Roughly goes into eight hours maybe less --(CHRIS: It's probably less)-- it wouldn't go over eight hours."},"684":{"dur":6,"text":"CHRIS: Oh, okay. I see. All right so are we gonna say it's about $100 an hour? \nMELINDA: Yeah"},"690":{"dur":3,"text":"CHRIS: Okay, you sure about this?\nSomething, my spider-sense is going off."},"693":{"dur":3,"text":"You're saying that it takes you\nsignificantly less time to do the lower budget jobs."},"697":{"dur":4,"text":"But also you could do it\nfaster and so it works out just fine."},"701":{"dur":5,"text":"MELINDA: Right. \nCHRIS: I thought it'd be a more dramatic difference to be honest."},"707":{"dur":6,"text":"MELINDA: There are, but I do have one client in particular I'm doing production work on which is $75 an hour."},"713":{"dur":5,"text":"And it's on-call basis. Which\nI need to update that relationship."},"719":{"dur":6,"text":"Because that's also breaking into my task switching a lot\n --(CHRIS: Yeah, it's hard to do that)-- \nso I'm losing a"},"725":{"dur":8,"text":"lot of mental energy and time when I'm\ntask switching on that too."},"733":{"dur":4,"text":"CHRIS: Okay, so in order for us to get a really clear picture as to what's going on here."},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"You are working at a lot of different rates. When you're working at your highest rate"},"742":{"dur":5,"text":"which is $137.50 you're doing really\nwell for yourself and when you're doing"},"747":{"dur":5,"text":"production work it's 75 bucks an hour\nand that's not bad per se that's that's"},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"actually pretty good except for the\nthing that we're not taking into account"},"755":{"dur":4,"text":"is the time it takes you to get back\ninto the work to find the files to kind"},"759":{"dur":4,"text":"of recover your steps and say okay I'm\nback in it and now I begin work and then"},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"the time it takes you to get out of that\nproject into the next thing."},"767":{"dur":4,"text":"So there's such a thing as billable\nhours and then you look at wow I can"},"771":{"dur":5,"text":"only bill for four hours today, but it's\nnow nine o'clock at night. What have I"},"776":{"dur":4,"text":"done? What is going on? What happened to\nthe time? Okay? So the first thing that"},"781":{"dur":4,"text":"you're going to need to realize is when\nyou do work at a rate that is"},"785":{"dur":4,"text":"effectively almost half of your normal\nrate this is what you're costing"},"789":{"dur":3,"text":"yourself and your company. Now I want you to start thinking about your company now."},"792":{"dur":6,"text":"Okay? Now a couple things we want to think about. \nSo the initial question is how do I deal with new biz?"},"799":{"dur":5,"text":"And if you don't deal with new business you're \nnot going to have a company for very long."},"805":{"dur":4,"text":"It's the single most important part of\nwhat you're doing. You work really hard,"},"809":{"dur":4,"text":"you do really good work in hopes that\nsomebody will call you. And when they do"},"814":{"dur":3,"text":"call you, you have to bring your A-game,\nand you have to give 'em your full attention."},"817":{"dur":4,"text":"So a couple of things right now \nthat I'm seeing immediately, okay?"},"822":{"dur":8,"text":"My first action item for you is to get some help."},"831":{"dur":6,"text":"And I also think that if you realistically are working 40 hours a week."},"837":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm just going to be real with you right now, it's not enough."},"842":{"dur":4,"text":"40 hours a week is what you do at a desk job somewhere clocking in and clocking out."},"847":{"dur":6,"text":"That's the full-time gig and that's why people\nwork a full-time gig because their hours are \nmore manageable."},"853":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a fallacy to think that people can go\nstart their own business and work the"},"857":{"dur":5,"text":"same or less hours that's not the case. Because, now you're your own boss and you"},"862":{"dur":3,"text":"need to be doing the jobs of three\npeople - the person does the work"},"866":{"dur":5,"text":"the person who does admin, client relationship \nthings and then doing sales and marketing."},"872":{"dur":6,"text":"And so effectively like I've not worked at 40 hour \na week maybe ever since I started my own company."},"878":{"dur":6,"text":"The hours are somewhere between 60 to 80 \nor something crazy like that okay even more."},"885":{"dur":6,"text":"And so some of you guys are sitting there \nthinking okay now I'm a workaholic.\nI'm advocating an unhealthy lifestyle."},"891":{"dur":5,"text":"I'm just a realist you guys. I'm just\ntrying to tell you what it takes to start a business."},"896":{"dur":4,"text":"Like let's not pile this upon a facade of fantasies \nand wishes and hopes and dreams."},"900":{"dur":7,"text":"It's a lot of work it's the grind life. \nAnd nobody's joking about that okay.\n It does take a lot of work."},"908":{"dur":10,"text":"So this is when people -- the way I always said \nthis, is like when you're sleeping, dreaming \nand thinking about breakfast"},"918":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm sitting there grinding, hustling, doing new \nbusiness development, writing content."},"923":{"dur":5,"text":"And it will separate the two of us really quickly. \nWork in work out okay."},"928":{"dur":5,"text":"I don't mean to say that you should try to destroy your life and not have a\npersonal relationship,"},"933":{"dur":4,"text":"but just to be a realist about that so first\n thing is I'm not sure you're working enough."},"938":{"dur":2,"text":"And two, you need to get some help, \nyou need to get some help."},"941":{"dur":6,"text":"So when you feel like I'm gonna burn out that's the time you start to think I need some help. Okay?"},"948":{"dur":2,"text":"MELINDA: Great. \nAnd I have a question based off that now. \nCHRIS: Yes."},"950":{"dur":3,"text":"MELINDA: Because I do outsource, not a ton, because"},"953":{"dur":6,"text":"and what's stopping me is the project\nmanagement time. Explaining the"},"959":{"dur":4,"text":"project to someone new sometimes takes\nmore time and eats up more time than it's worth."},"963":{"dur":5,"text":"And so that too is a hard\ntransition going from doing it all myself."},"968":{"dur":3,"text":"To then taking the time to\nexplain it to someone else and manage"},"972":{"dur":3,"text":"that relationship then, between them and\nme and client."},"976":{"dur":1,"text":"CHRIS: Okay you're not alone in this,"},"978":{"dur":4,"text":"every entrepreneur every business\nowner has had the same exact dilemma."},"982":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm really good at what I do, I'm very\nefficient so giving it to somebody else"},"986":{"dur":3,"text":"Who, a) is not going to work at the same\nlevel, and you have to accept that"},"990":{"dur":3,"text":"they're never going to be at the same\nlevel, but to take the time to explain it to them,"},"993":{"dur":7,"text":"to develop a process.
