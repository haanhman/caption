I've got some results to share\nwith you on the success we've seen. What we"},"240":{"dur":9,"text":"learned and what's next. So to get started,\nthe first challenge we had was we had a huge"},"250":{"dur":7,"text":"variation in performance. We looked at that\nand why we were getting such a variance because"},"257":{"dur":5,"text":"performance is a mixture of people & process.\nIs it the people delivering great service"},"262":{"dur":5,"text":"regardless of the process or is it the process\ndelivering great service regardless of the"},"268":{"dur":6,"text":"person? That's to say when we looked at range\nin performance we had huge variance on customer"},"274":{"dur":7,"text":"satisfaction. We had huge variance on handle\ntime of calls, we had huge variance on answers"},"281":{"dur":4,"text":"given to customers. We had a little bit of\na problem because customers were calling us"},"285":{"dur":5,"text":"back to check if what we have said was correct.\nBecause of the variance you sometimes would"},"291":{"dur":3,"text":"get a different answer when you phoned in.\nSo you could ring in three times and get three"},"295":{"dur":5,"text":"different results, which isn't great because\nthere is only one right answer generally for"},"301":{"dur":6,"text":"these things. What we found, and this was\nreally helpful later, was our best people"},"307":{"dur":6,"text":"could crack it. So our best agents were absolutely\nbringing the numbers in with the right handle-time"},"313":{"dur":5,"text":"and delivering a great customer experience.\nWe used this later on in the story as I continue"},"319":{"dur":5,"text":"through because using that knowledge we got\nfrom the best agents really helped to create"},"324":{"dur":8,"text":"really compelling content to look through.\nThe second challenge was, as I said the journey"},"333":{"dur":6,"text":"where we've gone through T-Mobile & Orange\ncombining, we had four knowledge tools. We"},"339":{"dur":6,"text":"had a T-Mobile knowledge tool, we had an Orange\nknowledge tool, we did diagnosis in Orange,"},"345":{"dur":7,"text":"and we had also introduced a fourth tool to\nadd to that. All of these tools were based"},"352":{"dur":7,"text":"around searching predominately with the exception\nof the diagnostics. What we found when we"},"359":{"dur":6,"text":"measured it was we were getting around 10%\nconsistent use of knowledge. So our advisors"},"366":{"dur":6,"text":"were using knowledge correctly and accurately\nand consistently around 10% of the time. The"},"373":{"dur":5,"text":"knowledge information was inconsistent so\nwhen we crossed the different systems, the"},"378":{"dur":5,"text":"same process might have a number of different\ninstructions. We were using tick sheets to"},"384":{"dur":5,"text":"capture contact reasons and we found those,\nI don't know if you guys found the same, pretty"},"389":{"dur":5,"text":"problematic. Years ago, we thought we had\na major problem with the answer phone. Just"},"394":{"dur":4,"text":"so happens it was at the top of the list of\nthe selected reasons. So we were worrying"},"399":{"dur":6,"text":"about that and in reality that wasn't the\ncase at all. We had, believe it or not, over"},"405":{"dur":7,"text":"20,000 articles across the knowledge base.\nNow when I first started we had a flip chart"},"413":{"dur":7,"text":"on the desk that had twenty pages in, with\nall of the help and knowledge you need.

It's"},"437":{"dur":7,"text":"completely where technology comes in and helps\nus here. Why did we choose eGain? Obviously"},"445":{"dur":6,"text":"we went through a RFP process as we would\nnormally do. The key reasons for eGain: Number"},"451":{"dur":6,"text":"one, it had the capabilities we wanted to\ndrive us forward. Secondly, we really felt"},"457":{"dur":6,"text":"the eGain team had a desire to work with us\nand help us realize our ambition. Thirdly,"},"464":{"dur":5,"text":"to collaborate as we grow. This isn't a journey\nthat we want to stop, we want to continue"},"469":{"dur":6,"text":"with [it]. So we wanted some collaboration\nwith that, on the route. That's what we feel"},"476":{"dur":10,"text":"eGain brings to the table. What we did and\nwhat we delivered next. So we got the inspiration"},"487":{"dur":5,"text":"from the NHS and the processes they use on\nthe grounds that we cannot afford to get it"},"492":{"dur":5,"text":"wrong. We had a real problem with getting\nit wrong and we absolutely wanted to crack"},"498":{"dur":7,"text":"that problem. We looked at what other organizations,\nsuch as NHS, were doing to actually get it"},"505":{"dur":7,"text":"right. Like most things, I don\u2019t know if\nyou guys do the same, but we have a habit"},"512":{"dur":5,"text":"of naming systems and our advisors love to\nbe part of that process as well. We called"},"518":{"dur":6,"text":"it Albert, no abbreviation for anything it\nis after Albert Einstein because we felt it"},"524":{"dur":9,"text":"was real expert knowledge in one place. The\nkey features we've implemented, summarized."},"533":{"dur":6,"text":"We pass in customer and device information\ninto the knowledge. We give the advisors the"},"540":{"dur":5,"text":"ability to pause and resume sessions. We do\nthis so that if we need to break a process"},"545":{"dur":5,"text":"with a customer, so we need them to stop and\ngo away and do something, we can allow them"},"550":{"dur":3,"text":"to do that and come back without having to\nstart explaining things again which was a"},"554":{"dur":6,"text":"problem we had previously. We also save the\nguided help session into our CRM system so"},"561":{"dur":7,"text":"anyone across the company, wider than customer\nservice, can see what has happened there."},"568":{"dur":7,"text":"This is a quick shot of the system as the\nadvisor lands on it. There is a step before"},"576":{"dur":5,"text":"this where the advisor puts the phone number\ninto a system we call Toolkit that our IT"},"581":{"dur":4,"text":"teams developed and then they are launched\ninto ALBERT. What that does is that it transfers"},"586":{"dur":5,"text":"the customer's information into the knowledge\nsystem and we start a journey there. There"},"591":{"dur":5,"text":"are a number of different sections you know,\ncustomer service, billing, network. It's the"},"596":{"dur":7,"text":"primary issue the customer is ringing about\ninitially that we go through. As I mentioned,"},"604":{"dur":5,"text":"pre-answering questions is really important\nbecause we use it for two purposes. Number"},"609":{"dur":4,"text":"one, it helps us minimize the number of questions\nwe need to ask our customers. Our customers"},"614":{"dur":5,"text":"think we are daft if we keep asking them things\nthat we already know about them. The second"},"619":{"dur":4,"text":"reason, it's really useful for reporting at\nthe end because we've got a snapshot in time"},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"of some key information there. What plan is\nthe customer on, what is the balance, those"},"627":{"dur":7,"text":"sort of things. That becomes super helpful\nlater, which we will go through. What we present"},"634":{"dur":7,"text":"to the advisors is pretty much a three column\nscreen. The first column, quite a dry example"},"641":{"dur":7,"text":"here but nothing contentious in it. The first\ncolumn is the question. There are two or more"},"649":{"dur":5,"text":"answers to the question and the advisor goes\nthrough and answers a series of questions"},"654":{"dur":7,"text":"which drives, ultimately, to a resolution.\nThe second column is the advisor help. Now"},"661":{"dur":6,"text":"what we haven't done is we haven't taught\nour advisors to work like robots and script"},"667":{"dur":4,"text":"everything. It was very important to us that\nwe didn't do that because it creates and unnatural"},"671":{"dur":4,"text":"flow of conversation. There are things at\ntimes, such as regulatory information, that"},"676":{"dur":5,"text":"we need to read out to cover it often in which\ncase we do script it but predominately we"},"681":{"dur":5,"text":"give the advisor the ability to deliver great\ncustomer service and give an engaging flow."},"687":{"dur":4,"text":"What we have in there is some useful hints\nand tips for the conversation.

The instructions are there on what\nto do within the CRM and that's really helpful"},"705":{"dur":4,"text":"in terms of saving training time because you've\ngot what you need to do right on the screen"},"709":{"dur":5,"text":"there. We also cover any other useful hint\nand anything else for the customer in that"},"714":{"dur":8,"text":"middle section. On the right-hand side, we\nhave some control buttons. Feedback I'll talk"},"723":{"dur":5,"text":"about in a moment. Restart, so if you've gone\ncompletely down the wrong route you can start"},"728":{"dur":6,"text":"right back again and move through. We also\nhave what we call \"Albert Breaking News.\""},"734":{"dur":6,"text":"This isn't information on content, these are\nthings to add a little bit of context around"},"741":{"dur":4,"text":"it. We make sure that's visible all of the\ntime in case there is any relevant that comes"},"746":{"dur":9,"text":"up outside of the guided help. Onto feedback\nnow, what we've found really important is,"},"755":{"dur":5,"text":"it is absolutely imperative that we have the\ncontent correct. It's really, really important"},"760":{"dur":4,"text":"on that and if there is something wrong we\nneed our advisors to tell us so we can fix"},"765":{"dur":4,"text":"it.

We find that really"},"828":{"dur":4,"text":"effective and the feedback loop is really\nimportant because it encourages people to"},"832":{"dur":7,"text":"feed back. We get several hundred bits of\nfeedback a week of which 10-15% of those actually"},"839":{"dur":7,"text":"result in change, mostly it is for clarity\nof information.

Ten is not necessarily a\nnumber you want to aim for but we've found"},"884":{"dur":5,"text":"is that it is the right balance in terms of\nthe number of case bases to set up. We did"},"889":{"dur":6,"text":"a complete overhaul and rewrite of our knowledge\ncontent and set standards up for that. That"},"895":{"dur":3,"text":"ensures that we've got consistency in the\nway it is presented and that really helps"},"899":{"dur":7,"text":"our front-line advisors.

As you guys know, it's quite"},"1000":{"dur":6,"text":"difficult sometimes to actually work out what\nhas driven what change.

When it was not at all, the old"},"1014":{"dur":8,"text":"way, 62% so a huge increase there of 23%.\nWe found also that guided help contributed"},"1022":{"dur":6,"text":"to a 20% increase in net promoter score. We\nmeasure, as we discussed earlier, customer"},"1028":{"dur":7,"text":"satisfaction. At the end of each call we send\nthem a text and use that to measure customer"},"1036":{"dur":5,"text":"satisfaction and we use NPS as one of the\nmethods for that.
