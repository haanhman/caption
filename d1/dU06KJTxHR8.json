{"0":{"dur":2,"text":"Hello, and welcome back to The Bee Vlog"},"2":{"dur":2,"text":"Today I've got a very special treat for you"},"5":{"dur":5,"text":"I'm going to be doing an inspection on Queen Helen here and taking mite counts using a different method"},"10":{"dur":3,"text":"If you remember my last video I did mite counts using the sticky boards"},"14":{"dur":5,"text":"and Queen Helen had the highest mite count of 69 mites dropped in 24 hours"},"20":{"dur":2,"text":"So today I'm going to be joined with Dr Dewey Caron"},"23":{"dur":4,"text":"who's going to be helping me and teaching me how to do mite counts using a different method"},"27":{"dur":4,"text":"This year I was very fortunate to be paired up with Dr Dewey Caron as my mentor"},"32":{"dur":2,"text":"in the Oregon State Master Beekeeping program"},"35":{"dur":3,"text":"Dr Caron has been a university professor for over 40 years"},"39":{"dur":3,"text":"over the University of Maryland, and Deleware. Is that right?"},"46":{"dur":4,"text":"In 2009 he retired and moved to Oregon where he lives half the year here"},"51":{"dur":5,"text":"and the other half of the year lives in Bolivia where he works with Africanized bees"},"56":{"dur":3,"text":"Down there I don't have a choice, do not have the chance to have nice gentle bees there"},"62":{"dur":5,"text":"This man knows bees. In fact he wrote a book called \"Honey Bee Biology and Beekeeping\""},"68":{"dur":4,"text":"You can buy that book on Amazon if you want, I'll provide a link down in the show notes"},"73":{"dur":3,"text":"And today he's going to be teaching me how to do mite counts"},"77":{"dur":3,"text":"using the alcohol wash and the sugar roll method. Right?"},"80":{"dur":2,"text":"Correct, we'll do both."},"83":{"dur":3,"text":"Now to do a sugar shake we're going to take a Mason jar"},"87":{"dur":3,"text":"Mason jar has half-a-cup gradations"},"90":{"dur":3,"text":"We're going to try to take bees from the brood area up to half a cup"},"95":{"dur":2,"text":"Fill it in there then we're going to add sugar"},"97":{"dur":5,"text":"So we've taken a Mason jar cover and replaced it by an #8 mesh hardware cloth"},"104":{"dur":2,"text":"What we're going to look for then is a frame of brood"},"108":{"dur":3,"text":"What we want to do is tilt the frame slightly backwards"},"112":{"dur":4,"text":"Now we can't collect bees into the jar, you're just not going to get enough"},"116":{"dur":5,"text":"so what we're going to do is bring the jar down just off of the backs of these bees"},"121":{"dur":3,"text":"and literally, they're going to just simply fall into the jar"},"127":{"dur":2,"text":"So by combing downward"},"132":{"dur":4,"text":"Now we've looked at the frame, we did a quick check that we don't have the queen there"},"138":{"dur":6,"text":"Since we're doing a sugar shake, it's not quite as critical, we're not going to kill these bees"},"144":{"dur":6,"text":"So if per chance we got the queen, we hope not, but just in case we're not going to end up killing her"},"150":{"dur":4,"text":"So now we'll tamp them down and see if we got half a cup of bees, looks like we're a little bit heavy"},"156":{"dur":3,"text":"So we'll tamp them down so that we think we've got our half-a-cup measure"},"160":{"dur":2,"text":"Then we'll replace our cover"},"163":{"dur":3,"text":"In doing so I just lean the frame back in there"},"166":{"dur":1,"text":"just to get it out of the way"},"169":{"dur":4,"text":"Now we have a half a cup, amounts to about a 300 bee sample"},"174":{"dur":5,"text":"Now we can check the sample and see how good we've done in terms of getting 300 bees"},"180":{"dur":4,"text":"and when you're first doing them you ought to do 2 or 3 or more to check"},"184":{"dur":3,"text":"It doesn't have to be exactly 300 but we're making assumptions"},"188":{"dur":5,"text":"So if it's 250 it's a little light, if it's at 350 it's a little heavy, so somewhere in that range"},"193":{"dur":8,"text":"We're going to add about 2 tablespoons initially of ordinary confectionary sugar"},"202":{"dur":5,"text":"Bees can be on the screen so we don't want to break off legs and appendages"},"208":{"dur":2,"text":"Just mush that in"},"214":{"dur":6,"text":"The amount of sugar is not critical, we just want enough to cover the bee body in good shape"},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"So we've added a couple tablespoons"},"227":{"dur":5,"text":"and we're going to push it down in without crushing bee legs or proboscus"},"234":{"dur":8,"text":"Then sort of in a rolling fashion we're going to distribute that powder sugar on all of the bee bodies"},"243":{"dur":6,"text":"You can still see a little bit of flight but we're getting it pretty much distributed"},"250":{"dur":5,"text":"We like to do this, get it distributed, we're essentially washing their bodies of the mites"},"255":{"dur":8,"text":"So take 20 to 30 seconds of trying to get that sugar well distributed"},"264":{"dur":6,"text":"In areas with a higher humidity this is not quite as easy because the sugar can clump a little bit"},"272":{"dur":4,"text":"We're going to try to keep it so it actually is real powdery"},"277":{"dur":7,"text":"Apperantly it causes the mites on the backs of the bees or on the thorax, abdomen, to lose their grip"},"285":{"dur":4,"text":"and so they're going to be falling into the mixture here"},"292":{"dur":8,"text":"Now what we like to then do is sort of bake the bees in a little bit more humidity, not to dehydration"},"300":{"dur":6,"text":"we're not trying to kill these bees, we're trying to get that sugar to do its job"},"307":{"dur":3,"text":"So we're going to put these in an area that has a little bit of sun here"},"311":{"dur":4,"text":"and let it sit for about the same amount of time and we'll come back and shake them again"},"316":{"dur":4,"text":"So we're going to put this in the sun for just a half-a-minute, minute"},"321":{"dur":4,"text":"We sat it down in the sun to let it bake a little bit"},"325":{"dur":6,"text":"not to dehydrate, but to help that sugar loosen the mites' grip on bees"},"331":{"dur":6,"text":"and so now we're shaking for another 20 or 30 seconds, we're trying to distribute the sugar"},"337":{"dur":1,"text":"on to all those bees"},"340":{"dur":6,"text":"This really is not hurting them, but we find that unless we're kind of vigorous with the shaking"},"346":{"dur":4,"text":"we don't get a good sample"},"351":{"dur":4,"text":"We can check our sample accuracy later after we've checked for mites"},"356":{"dur":3,"text":"by reapplying sugar to the very same bees"},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"and shaking again and see if we get additional mites"},"363":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, so we've done the shaking now a couple of times"},"367":{"dur":6,"text":"Now we're going to go ahead and shake out the powder sugar, the bees of course are going to be held"},"373":{"dur":5,"text":"by the screened top"},"379":{"dur":5,"text":"So we want to get the powder sugar out and right away you're going to see a lot of dark specks"},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"and those are going to actually be the mites"},"388":{"dur":2,"text":"that are coming out"},"391":{"dur":8,"text":"Now we can shake legs off, we can do some damage to the bees so it doesn't necessarily mean every speck"},"399":{"dur":1,"text":"is going to be a mite"},"401":{"dur":5,"text":"But it's a good beginning look"},"410":{"dur":5,"text":"Again sort of that rolling seems to help as well, it helps to get the sugar distributed"},"416":{"dur":5,"text":"So there's our pile, we've used a white surface, in this case our hive top surface"},"422":{"dur":6,"text":"If we also want to get a little white pan, you can just shake them into a little white pan"},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"and that works just as well"},"439":{"dur":5,"text":"Okay, now we've got our pile of sugar there and our mites"},"445":{"dur":7,"text":"Now we can just kind of dissolve the sugar away by just a mist of water"},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"Then the mites are going to stick right out"},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"It's going to make counting pretty easy"},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"So we're going to start here, we can just move them off to the side"},"466":{"dur":6,"text":"1, 2... that's a little bit lighter, but it was still phoretic on the bees"},"472":{"dur":5,"text":"3, 4, 5... you can see we're looking for that size and shape"},"478":{"dur":4,"text":"If you need, at this point, to bring a magnifier it will be easier to count"},"484":{"dur":9,"text":"I like to use a counter...6, 7, 8, 9..."},"494":{"dur":5,"text":"42, 43...one flew all the way over there, 44"},"503":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay so we have 44 in our sample of 300"},"508":{"dur":9,"text":"As I indicated if we want to check, did we really get the majority of mites out of there? Was 44 a good sample?"},"517":{"dur":9,"text":"We can just go ahead and repeat, we don't need to add as much, we don't need to shake quite as long"},"530":{"dur":6,"text":"As best we know this really is not harming the bees, all this shaking"},"536":{"dur":7,"text":"And they're going to be really covered with sugar at the end of this so they're going to be in no"},"544":{"dur":3,"text":"shape to come out and try to sting anyone"},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"They're all just going to be sugared right down"},"552":{"dur":5,"text":"We can put these bees back into the colony, on the entrance, right in the top, whichever way you prefer"},"557":{"dur":6,"text":"and the bees will then go ahead and clean off their sisters of the extra sugar"},"564":{"dur":3,"text":"This confectionary sugar has a little bit of starch in it"},"568":{"dur":6,"text":"That's harmful for brood, but the adults, with good flight and good weather conditions"},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"can handle that little bit of starch that's in the sugar"},"577":{"dur":6,"text":"Again, I'm not going to put them in the sun this time because we're just trying to check our mite numbers"},"583":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's check a second...wow"},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"We did not do real well that first time"},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"I can see coming out already some more"},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"Looks like we got, unfortunately, a leg there"},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's go ahead and dissolve the rest of this sugar"},"606":{"dur":3,"text":"We're going to add that number with the other previous number"},"609":{"dur":9,"text":"So we had 41, 42, 43...49"},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"in our sample"},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"So we think we got 49"},"628":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, we can go ahead and check how close we are to 300 bees"},"634":{"dur":8,"text":"by kind of slowly releasing these adults and counting fast"},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"So we could do that count that way"},"648":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, for our alcohol we've got a slightly different collecting jar"},"651":{"dur":3,"text":"This is one that was developed in Canada"},"656":{"dur":6,"text":"This one has 2 jars joined together and in the middle of that is our #8 mesh screen"},"663":{"dur":4,"text":"We're going to collect our numbers in the same way"},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"We're going to take out a brood frame"},"672":{"dur":5,"text":"Now this is going to be a destruct, that is we're going to end up killing the bees with the alcohol"},"677":{"dur":5,"text":"So now we've got to be a little more careful that we don't collect the queen into here"},"683":{"dur":4,"text":"So we're going to look first and do our search pattern and see if we see the queen"},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"Looks pretty good that we do not"},"691":{"dur":4,"text":"So again, in our sampling we're not going to be able to put bees in this jar"},"695":{"dur":4,"text":"So what we do in our sampling is we come back along the backs of the bees"},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"and literally, they fall into our collecting container"},"703":{"dur":7,"text":"And usually they're confused at this point, so the chance of a sting, although possible, is not very likely"},"711":{"dur":4,"text":"We got maybe half of what we want from the one side, sometimes we'll go to a couple frames"},"716":{"dur":7,"text":"An alternative to this is to shake this frame and another frame into a honey bucket, a white honey bucket"},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"Put all the bees in there"},"727":{"dur":7,"text":"Tap the honey bucket on its side, get all the bees in the bottom corner, then take a one-half-cup scoop"},"735":{"dur":7,"text":"from all those bees together and then put that half-scoop into your collecting container"},"743":{"dur":3,"text":"In this case now, as I indicated, we're going to use alcohol"},"747":{"dur":4,"text":"We're going to use ordinary rubbing alcohol"},"752":{"dur":5,"text":"You can use the real hooch, but if you're going to do that, take it first then put the rest in there"},"758":{"dur":1,"text":"That's for your troubles"},"759":{"dur":1,"text":"Now how much alcohol do you need?"},"761":{"dur":6,"text":"We want to wash the bees, so we're going to fill up maybe 1\/2 the jar, or 1\/3 of the jar"},"767":{"dur":1,"text":"with the alcohol"},"770":{"dur":4,"text":"Now in this case we've got these co-joined jars"},"775":{"dur":6,"text":"Again now we're going to wash our adult sample of mites"},"782":{"dur":3,"text":"And again with that swirling action"},"786":{"dur":7,"text":"Now this has brood on it, it's a little cool, it's in the 70s this morning so we'll put it back in to let the bees"},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"get their body heat back in the brood area"},"798":{"dur":8,"text":"You can use, in addition to rubbing alcohol, diethyl ether which is car starter fluid"},"807":{"dur":6,"text":"I think that's a bit of a cruel way to die"},"814":{"dur":1,"text":"It's also a fire hazard too"},"815":{"dur":1,"text":"Also a fire hazard around your smoker"},"817":{"dur":6,"text":"You can use soapy water, but you'll get a lot of soap suds if you have a real soaping liquid"},"824":{"dur":6,"text":"Others like window washer fluid, but what you want to try to avoid is something where the"},"831":{"dur":4,"text":"mites are going to float on top"},"835":{"dur":4,"text":"You really want to get them well washed"},"841":{"dur":6,"text":"So now I'm going to start my collecting sample by taking the alcohol"},"848":{"dur":8,"text":"So what I've done is I've inverted my double jar, and in so doing the alcohol then has been sorted through"},"856":{"dur":1,"text":"washed through the bees"},"858":{"dur":2,"text":"The adult bee sample is held there at the top"},"861":{"dur":7,"text":"And so then at the bottom I have my mite count sitting in my alcohol wash"},"869":{"dur":9,"text":"In this case, what we can also do is go ahead and doubly wash them"},"879":{"dur":3,"text":"And this does not hurt at all"},"883":{"dur":6,"text":"We're going to add some more alcohol to our container, and this double container is handy for that"},"890":{"dur":7,"text":"But again, if you have just the one jar it will work just as well"},"899":{"dur":5,"text":"And again this is kind of confirming that we have indeed washed all the bees"},"905":{"dur":7,"text":"If we have a sample of more than 300 bees sometimes those mites can just get stuck in that sample material"},"914":{"dur":7,"text":"Now I'm going to pour my liquid out with the mites coming out, pouring it through my sample of adult bees"},"928":{"dur":6,"text":"And then I can do my count, you can look down through or it's really very easy to kind of look up from below"},"935":{"dur":3,"text":"And you'll see in the alcohol"},"938":{"dur":3,"text":"and this is what you want for a wash material, you don't want to have floaters because"},"942":{"dur":1,"text":"you're going to have a perspective"},"943":{"dur":3,"text":"How are you going to count if you've got some floating on the top vs on the bottom?"},"948":{"dur":2,"text":"But this is all clear through the bottom"},"950":{"dur":3,"text":"We'll go ahead and start a count, again we're looking at that same size"},"953":{"dur":2,"text":"We're going to start at this point 1,2..."},"958":{"dur":1,"text":"...22, I get here"},"960":{"dur":3,"text":"We had 49, then in this sample we had 22"},"967":{"dur":4,"text":"Same hive, a good thing that we could do at this point would be to"},"972":{"dur":4,"text":"average 2 different ways that we counted if you want to do the 2 counts"},"976":{"dur":8,"text":"But in our case, we find that if we've got our 300 bees, then we have over our shreshold"},"985":{"dur":3,"text":"Now the threshold will vary with the mite numbers through the year"},"989":{"dur":6,"text":"We're doing an August count so we like to have the number, ideally, around 2%"},"996":{"dur":3,"text":"2% of mites on the number of adults that we have"},"1000":{"dur":2,"text":"But it will be higher at this time"},"1003":{"dur":4,"text":"So hopefully not much higher than 5 or even 10%"},"1008":{"dur":8,"text":"And so if we have 300 bees and certainly we had 49 and then 22, so we've got somewhere in the 30 range"},"1017":{"dur":4,"text":"30 on 300, obviously 10% or a little bit better"},"1022":{"dur":5,"text":"Which indicates that our mite numbers have gotten a little bit away from us on this particular colony"},"1027":{"dur":3,"text":"Now we have to decide if we want to do a mite control or not"},"1031":{"dur":7,"text":"What it is saying at 10% is this colony has some risk of having the mite numbers go even higher"},"1039":{"dur":3,"text":"on into September when the mite numbers will peak"},"1042":{"dur":6,"text":"and if we want to help the colony combat the mites and their possibility of transmission of virus"},"1049":{"dur":3,"text":"we need to at this point to consider some sort of control"},"1052":{"dur":6,"text":"So in our sample we wanted to have 300 bees and so what we're going to do with the alcohol bees at this point"},"1059":{"dur":7,"text":"and by the way as I did that I find now there is 1, 2, 3, 4 more mites"},"1066":{"dur":2,"text":"So we are at 26"},"1068":{"dur":4,"text":"Now I'm going to go ahead and count these bees"},"1073":{"dur":4,"text":"310...315...320..."},"1089":{"dur":3,"text":"So 346 in our our alcohol sample"},"1092":{"dur":6,"text":"We had a total of 26 mites and so now it's going to be"},"1099":{"dur":7,"text":"26 divided by 346 and that gives us that percentage of mite load in a colony"},"1107":{"dur":5,"text":"We're going to do the same with our powder sample"},"1113":{"dur":2,"text":"We're going to count these bees"},"1115":{"dur":3,"text":"Now we're going to release them back directly into the hive"},"1120":{"dur":3,"text":"We can do this at the bottom board or into the hive"},"1123":{"dur":8,"text":"And you can get an approximation of the count just to see if you are in the vicinity of the 300"},"1133":{"dur":4,"text":"There are some bees that are going to go right away on our release here"},"1146":{"dur":3,"text":"So we've got 1, 2, 3..."},"1153":{"dur":2,"text":"71, 72, 73..."},"1159":{"dur":1,"text":"Whoops the queen!"},"1161":{"dur":2,"text":"Just kidding!"},"1163":{"dur":5,"text":"And so we've got 290...1, 2, 3..."},"1174":{"dur":3,"text":"304 in that powder sugar sample"},"1178":{"dur":3,"text":"And of course that was half a cup in our container"},"1182":{"dur":6,"text":"So we did 304, we had 49 mites, so it would be 49 divided by the 304 adults"},"1189":{"dur":7,"text":"You can see, here's our powder sugar mass of bees, and they're quickly being assimilated right into the colony"},"1196":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay, part of the program of the Oregon Master Beekeeper Apprentice program"},"1201":{"dur":5,"text":"is to team up a new beekeeper with a mentor"},"1207":{"dur":6,"text":"and we want to try to have a minimum of 4 visits between mentor and mentee"},"1213":{"dur":5,"text":"and to record those and see the progress through a whole year"},"1219":{"dur":5,"text":"We have our sheet and so what we're going to basically do on this is we have"},"1225":{"dur":3,"text":"this one is our Nectar Flow to Honey Extracting"},"1228":{"dur":3,"text":"So this would be our July into August visit"},"1231":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we would then have a discussion"},"1234":{"dur":4,"text":"things such as supering, how would you manage a colony during the flow"},"1239":{"dur":3,"text":"After you've taken supers off, extracted, and stored the supers"},"1242":{"dur":3,"text":"Other things that would then occur in this time frame"},"1246":{"dur":4,"text":"providing water, are you going to leave queen excluders on the colony"},"1250":{"dur":1,"text":"did you use them in the beginning"},"1251":{"dur":4,"text":"What if there's a nectar dearth or robbing period?"},"1256":{"dur":4,"text":"And so we would then confirm that we've had at least the discussion"},"1261":{"dur":5,"text":"and the apprentice beekeeper has had some familiarity with these aspects"},"1266":{"dur":2,"text":"and then we would sign off on those"},"1268":{"dur":5,"text":"For a year as an apprentice between mentee and mentor, we're going to do 4 of these"},"1274":{"dur":3,"text":"each them keyed to a different time of the season"},"1278":{"dur":3,"text":"Thank you very much Dewey for helping me out and coming out and visiting"},"1282":{"dur":4,"text":"and showing me how to do the mite counts, that was a very great demonstration"},"1286":{"dur":2,"text":"Thank you for inviting me"}}
