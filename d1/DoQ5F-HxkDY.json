man."},"467":{"dur":4,"text":"And he insisted that\nI drink his iced tea."},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"And we talked, and\ntalked, and talked."},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"And he just wouldn't stop."},"475":{"dur":1,"text":"And he didn't say anything."},"476":{"dur":3,"text":"For three hours we chatted, but\nhe didn't want to let me go."},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"And something told me to stay."},"483":{"dur":4,"text":"And at hour five-- this was\nbefore the era of iPhones,"},"487":{"dur":3,"text":"so I was just standing up\nmy next interviews-- he let"},"491":{"dur":1,"text":"slip

wine at dinner,"},"516":{"dur":3,"text":"she started dropping the\nN-word, just randomly."},"520":{"dur":3,"text":"And was full of\ninvective at people"},"523":{"dur":1,"text":"like this man I'd interviewed."},"524":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'd stumbled on by\njust sitting and listening."},"528":{"dur":3,"text":"You can't get at that\nwith the kind of big data"},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"that we do so well."},"534":{"dur":4,"text":"And so that throws us back on\nto messiness, and anthropology,"},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"and what Lily King has written."},"541":{"dur":4,"text":"The depths, the shallowness,\nof our systematic knowledge"},"545":{"dur":5,"text":"forces us back onto this very\ndifficult way of knowing."},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"To me Euphoria asks\nthree great questions."},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'll end with this, and\nget in under my six minutes,"},"556":{"dur":5,"text":"I hope, about this\ndifficult way of knowing."},"561":{"dur":4,"text":"It is, of course,\nwho, what, and how."},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"First in all this\nmessiness, the question"},"568":{"dur":1,"text":"is right front and center."},"569":{"dur":1,"text":"And if you've\nstudied it in class,"},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm sure you talked\nabout this a lot."},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"Whom do we study?"},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"These three anthropologists\ngo into the field,"},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"but they obviously don't\ndo the prescribed thing."},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"They're supposed to be\nscholars studying others,"},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"but before long, the others keep\nentering and getting enmeshed"},"584":{"dur":0,"text":"in their lives."},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"The object becomes the subject."},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"They write their own stories,\nalong with the stories"},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"of others."},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"And that raises the question."},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"It's true of these\nthree for

what?"},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"What do we see?"},"612":{"dur":5,"text":"The tribes in this book are\nboth a mirror and a window."},"617":{"dur":3,"text":"These three anthropologists\nare trying to see."},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"They're looking through\nthe window, trying to see,"},"623":{"dur":1,"text":"trying to understand the tribe."},"624":{"dur":4,"text":"And as they look, I draw on\nanother

Erised."},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"You remember, you\nlook in the mirror,"},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"or at least Harry Potter does."},"644":{"dur":3,"text":"And he finds there nothing\nless than the deepest"},"648":{"dur":1,"text":"desire of his heart."},"649":{"dur":3,"text":"And these anthropologists\nare looking out the window"},"653":{"dur":1,"text":"at these tribes they\nwant to understand."},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"And at the same time, looking\nat the tribes, what they find,"},"658":{"dur":3,"text":"what they see, what they\nsearch, is the deepest desire"},"662":{"dur":1,"text":"of their hearts."},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"It's true of these\nthree characters."},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"Is it true of all of\nus social scientists?"},"668":{"dur":1,"text":"We've got to start\nby understanding"},"670":{"dur":1,"text":"others, or trying."},"672":{"dur":3,"text":"And to do so, we have\nto know ourselves."},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"And eventually, we erase\nthe division between them"},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"and us, between\nsubject and object,"},"680":{"dur":3,"text":"and we have to understand in us."},"683":{"dur":1,"text":"But to go back to\nthe question, what"},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"do we see when we\nlook at something"},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"we want to understand deeply?"},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"And finally, how?"},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"How do we know?"},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"And here, I think, to\nsummarize everything I've said,"},"695":{"dur":4,"text":"we try so hard to\nunderstand ideas, thoughts,"},"700":{"dur":4,"text":"and actions, things we fully\napprehend with our brain."},"704":{"dur":3,"text":"But what this book says,\nsubversively but insistently,"},"707":{"dur":3,"text":"that it's also emotions\nthat enter into it."},"711":{"dur":1,"text":"It's our own desires."},"712":{"dur":1,"text":"It's their
