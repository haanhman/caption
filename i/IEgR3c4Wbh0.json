that was a very\nbig topic at that time,"},"2303":{"dur":2,"text":"better than working in the\nfuneral business, I would say,"},"2306":{"dur":2,"text":"but not a whole lot better,\nespecially in the

in a bigger\nmarketing role."},"2395":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's a pattern I've had\na couple times over the years--"},"2397":{"dur":4,"text":"to go seek out a more high risk,\nhigh reward type
