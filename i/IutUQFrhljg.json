the\ninternet was mainly dial up."},"54":{"dur":2,"text":"MARK NICHOLS: So unfortunately,\nI missed my synchronous moment."},"57":{"dur":2,"text":"The computer crashed\njust as my name came up."},"59":{"dur":2,"text":"But the Open University\nprovided me with the proceedings"},"61":{"dur":1,"text":"on a disk, so I was\nable to watch it later."},"63":{"dur":1,"text":"So you did that

different."},"98":{"dur":0,"text":"MARK NICHOLS: Yes, I did."},"99":{"dur":1,"text":"I wanted to look\nbeyond just online"},"100":{"dur":1,"text":"and look at digital\ntechnologies."},"102":{"dur":1,"text":"Because I feel\nlike online is just"},"103":{"dur":2,"text":"an extension of what digital\ntechnologies can do with us."},"106":{"dur":1,"text":"So I thought that would be a\ngood focus for this morning."},"108":{"dur":1,"text":"So what do you\nwant to start with?"},"110":{"dur":1,"text":"MARK NICHOLS:\nWell, I think there"},"112":{"dur":2,"text":"are three main ways in which\ntechnologies now actually help"},"114":{"dur":1,"text":"us in teaching and learning."},"116":{"dur":2,"text":"Firstly, we've got unprecedented\naccess to information."},"119":{"dur":2,"text":"So we can find almost anything\nwith a quick Google search."},"122":{"dur":2,"text":"And of course, we've got\nwonderful services here"},"124":{"dur":0,"text":"at the OU too."},"125":{"dur":2,"text":"We can find articles\nfrom the library."},"127":{"dur":2,"text":"We can search from anything,\nfrom YouTube, anything."},"129":{"dur":2,"text":"So we've got\nunprecedented access."},"131":{"dur":2,"text":"Very, very easy to find\nstuff and also to download it"},"134":{"dur":1,"text":"and potentially use it later on."},"135":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Excellent."},"136":{"dur":2,"text":"MARK NICHOLS: Secondly, we can\nquickly process and present"},"139":{"dur":1,"text":"information."},"140":{"dur":2,"text":"So we can actually put\ntogether our thoughts,"},"142":{"dur":2,"text":"combine the thoughts of\nothers into new ways using"},"145":{"dur":2,"text":"the likes of Word, PowerPoint."},"147":{"dur":3,"text":"For those who are more advanced,\npossibly video casting or pod"},"151":{"dur":1,"text":"So there's a whole lot\nof ways we can actually"},"153":{"dur":3,"text":"bring together our ideas\nand share them in new ways."},"156":{"dur":2,"text":"And we can also\ndiscuss information now"},"158":{"dur":1,"text":"in ways that were\njust completely"},"160":{"dur":2,"text":"unknown about 20 years ago."},"162":{"dur":3,"text":"So the artifacts and\nideas we put together"},"165":{"dur":1,"text":"in our own documents\nand things, we"},"166":{"dur":3,"text":"can now share through the\nlikes of social media."},"170":{"dur":1,"text":"And in formal\neducation too there's"},"172":{"dur":1,"text":"now a lot of use of\nonline discussion forums."},"174":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: So\nyour point is really"},"176":{"dur":2,"text":"it's not just a different or\npoorer alternative to things."},"178":{"dur":2,"text":"It actually opens a range of\nnew and exciting options--"},"181":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: --that people can\ntake to enhance their study."},"183":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, we've got a whole\nlot of widgets here,"},"185":{"dur":1,"text":"these interactive tools."},"187":{"dur":2,"text":"And we'd like to\nknow what you think"},"189":{"dur":1,"text":"and how you're behaving online."},"191":{"dur":2,"text":"So those should be\nappearing on your screen."},"193":{"dur":3,"text":"We would like to know how\noften you use the internet when"},"196":{"dur":2,"text":"you're studying,\nand how often do you"},"198":{"dur":1,"text":"use the computer as a student."},"200":{"dur":1,"text":"So those are some of\nthe ones that we're"},"202":{"dur":1,"text":"But we've also got\nother questions"},"204":{"dur":1,"text":"that we'd like to know."},"205":{"dur":2,"text":"We'd like to know which\nthree success factors do"},"207":{"dur":1,"text":"you think you need to work on."},"209":{"dur":1,"text":"So you might want to\nhave a little think"},"210":{"dur":2,"text":"about which of those\noptions you can look at."},"213":{"dur":2,"text":"And which of the three main\napplications of the website"},"215":{"dur":0,"text":"you use as a student."},"216":{"dur":2,"text":"That could be very\ninteresting for us to know."},"218":{"dur":3,"text":"And in terms of technology\nfor education, where you see"},"222":{"dur":1,"text":"yourself in terms of a scale."},"223":{"dur":2,"text":"So whether you think you're a\nbeginner or whether you think"},"226":{"dur":1,"text":"you're a little\nbit more confident."},"227":{"dur":2,"text":"So we'd like to know the\nanswers of the questions,"},"229":{"dur":3,"text":"and we will be bringing those\ninto our discussion with Mark."},"233":{"dur":2,"text":"So firstly, then,\nthis difference"},"235":{"dur":1,"text":"between online and digital."},"236":{"dur":2,"text":"What is the difference, then,\nbetween those two aspects?"},"238":{"dur":2,"text":"You've spoken a little bit\nabout accessing information"},"241":{"dur":1,"text":"and how those are different."},"242":{"dur":2,"text":"But what would you say\nthe main difference is?"},"244":{"dur":1,"text":"MARK NICHOLS: Well, I\nthink online actually"},"246":{"dur":1,"text":"requires you to be\nconnected to the internet"},"248":{"dur":1,"text":"to make the most of it."},"249":{"dur":1,"text":"Digital, there's a\nwhole lot you can"},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"do with a computer that\ndoesn't require you to have"},"253":{"dur":1,"text":"internet access whatsoever."},"255":{"dur":2,"text":"So the likes of using a word\nprocess, of reading things"},"257":{"dur":0,"text":"offline."},"258":{"dur":1,"text":"There's a whole host\nof things that you"},"260":{"dur":1,"text":"don't need to\nactually be physically"},"261":{"dur":1,"text":"connected to the internet to do."},"263":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's really important to\nhold both of those things"},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"together because online\ndoesn't necessarily"},"268":{"dur":3,"text":"mean-- when we talk about online\neducation-- doesn't necessarily"},"271":{"dur":1,"text":"mean you have to be\nonline at all times."},"273":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Now,\nour students who"},"274":{"dur":1,"text":"are watching this,\nunsurprisingly perhaps,"},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"are feeling quite confident\nwith their use of technology."},"279":{"dur":2,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: They're using their\ncomputers most of the time."},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"So that could just be a\nbias in terms of the people"},"284":{"dur":1,"text":"who have come along today."},"285":{"dur":1,"text":"How accurate would\nyou say that is"},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"as a representation of the\nOU population of students?"},"290":{"dur":1,"text":"MARK NICHOLS: Ooh, I\ncouldn't say for sure."},"292":{"dur":1,"text":"But my understanding\nis that most students"},"294":{"dur":2,"text":"are very confident\nusers of technology."},"296":{"dur":2,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: The overwhelming\nthing they need to focus on"},"298":{"dur":1,"text":"is focus, though."},"300":{"dur":2,"text":"So unsurprisingly, we've\nbeen talking a little bit"},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"about that during the sessions."},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"So that is all very interesting."},"307":{"dur":1,"text":"So there are various\ntypes of technologies."},"308":{"dur":1,"text":"But you've said that\nthere are three main ways"},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"in which digital tools can\nhelp us in our learning."},"312":{"dur":2,"text":"And you've spoken a\nlittle bit about accessing"},"315":{"dur":1,"text":"some information."},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"We spoke last week about some\nof the sessions with the library"},"319":{"dur":1,"text":"and about procrastination\nand about not"},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"accessing too much information."},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"So when is being digital helpful\nfor accessing information,"},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"and how do you know when\nto start and when to stop?"},"327":{"dur":1,"text":"MARK NICHOLS: Oh,\nit's a good question."},"329":{"dur":3,"text":"I think digital, if you did\na Google search for a subject"},"333":{"dur":3,"text":"straight off, you tend to get\nthe most popular hits first."},"336":{"dur":1,"text":"And they'll usually\nbe the most helpful."},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"But when I do my\nown online study,"},"340":{"dur":2,"text":"I tend to do a fairly\ngeneral search first just"},"342":{"dur":3,"text":"to get a view as to the breadth\nof ideas that are out there."},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"And then gradually, I get\na sense of how to focus."},"347":{"dur":1,"text":"But it does require\na bit of discipline"},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"to eventually get to that\nstage where OK, I now need"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"to start putting some\nideas aside and focusing"},"353":{"dur":1,"text":"in on those that are\nreally of interest to me."},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Why would you say\nfocus is such an issue then?"},"358":{"dur":1,"text":"Because people are saying\nthey struggle with that."},"359":{"dur":1,"text":"And we've been speaking\nbefore with Georgina"},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"about how to identify when\nyou need to do something,"},"363":{"dur":1,"text":"when to stop procrastinating."},"365":{"dur":1,"text":"But if you don't know\nwhat to focus on,"},"366":{"dur":1,"text":"how do you know how\nto rein that focus in?"},"368":{"dur":0,"text":"MARK NICHOLS: Yeah."},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"I think from a use of\ntechnology perspective,"},"372":{"dur":1,"text":"focus is a little bit different."},"374":{"dur":1,"text":"From a use of\ntechnology perspective,"},"375":{"dur":1,"text":"I'd be inclined to\nclose down everything"},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"except what I'm working on."},"378":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Yeah."},"379":{"dur":1,"text":"MARK NICHOLS: It's all\ntoo easy to be distracted"},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"and to even distract yourself by\nhaving your email client open,"},"383":{"dur":1,"text":"by having a Twitter feed open."},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"Every now and then you'll\nget a ding or an alert"},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"from Skype when\nsomeone else logs in."},"388":{"dur":2,"text":"It pays in a study session to a\nclose all of that sort of thing"},"391":{"dur":0,"text":"down."},"392":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: That\nis such good advice,"},"393":{"dur":1,"text":"and I occasionally do that."},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"But it's very, very\ndifficult-- I find, anyway--"},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"to turn especially my email\noff, and my social media."},"400":{"dur":1,"text":"Because I'll often think,\noh, I'll just have those on."},"402":{"dur":1,"text":"Least I'll know when\nsomething happens."},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"And yet it's so easy to become\ndistracted because you've got"},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"all of this feed into things."},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"And also there's, I\nguess, pressure to be"},"411":{"dur":1,"text":"connected a lot of the time."},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"So how would you\nadvise people if they"},"414":{"dur":1,"text":"are focusing on\none thing, manage"},"416":{"dur":3,"text":"that digital range of networks\nto stop doing something?"},"419":{"dur":1,"text":"MARK NICHOLS: Well,\nI think you've always"},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"got control as a user yourself."},"423":{"dur":1,"text":"MARK NICHOLS: Another\nimportant aspect"},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"of studying online\nor studying digitally"},"427":{"dur":1,"text":"is to actually organize\nyour study time."},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"MARK NICHOLS: What I tend to\ndo is decide that I'm actually"},"432":{"dur":0,"text":"offline for two hours."},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm just out of this world."},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm just focusing on what I need\nto focus on for study purposes."},"437":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'll actually\nturn off email."},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"And some things can\nwait a little while"},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"while you focus on\nthe study at hand."},"443":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Yeah."},"444":{"dur":0,"text":"OK."},"445":{"dur":3,"text":"Yeah, focus was chosen by 49%\nof the students voting today."},"449":{"dur":1,"text":"So a key issue."},"450":{"dur":1,"text":"That's a really good thing."},"451":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think it's such a\nsimple piece of advice,"},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"but it makes a massive, massive\ndifference because yeah,"},"456":{"dur":1,"text":"you would just be able to focus."},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"But as you say you can\nalso use digital tools"},"460":{"dur":3,"text":"for collating and presenting and\ngathering information as well."},"463":{"dur":1,"text":"What would some\nof your advice be"},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"there in terms of\nhow people could use"},"466":{"dur":1,"text":"that as an organizational tool?"},"468":{"dur":0,"text":"MARK NICHOLS: Yeah."},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"I think organizationally,\nwhat I tend"},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"to do when I study\nan online module is"},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"I put a folder together\nand I include everything"},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"in that folder that I need\nfor that particular module."},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'll tend to go into the\nonline version of the module"},"480":{"dur":1,"text":"through the VLE."},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll download all of\nthe assets that I can,"},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"all of the PDF files,\nall of the video files,"},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"anything I can lay my hands on."},"487":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'll put it into\nthis one folder."},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"That way, if I'm not\nonline, if I actually"},"492":{"dur":3,"text":"have to go via train somewhere\nor in my car-- as a passenger,"},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"of course-- where I won't\nhave internet access,"},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"I do have access to all\nof my study materials."},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's just a very simple\nthing which I tend to do."},"504":{"dur":3,"text":"I also make sure too that\nI've got my own way of working"},"508":{"dur":0,"text":"with those materials."},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"So with the documents, I've\ngot it within that folder."},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll know, for\nexample, that if I'm"},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"going to read part\nof my module notes,"},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll open up the\nPDF document and I"},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"have all of the tools I\nneed to actually work on"},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"in that PDF reader."},"523":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's really just\nmaking sure that I"},"525":{"dur":1,"text":"know how I'm going to\napproach the materials."},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"Not just downloading\nthem, but also knowing I'm"},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"going to engage with them."},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: When you say\nthe tools to use PDFs--"},"531":{"dur":1,"text":"because I've recently just\ndiscovered some of these."},"533":{"dur":0,"text":"They're brilliant."},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"Ways you can annotate things and\nactually make it work for you."},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"Because there are times I\nread a PDF and I'll think,"},"539":{"dur":1,"text":"oh, I'll write that down."},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"And then where was that\npiece of paper, et cetera."},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"Briefly, how could people\nengage with some of those tools?"},"545":{"dur":0,"text":"What sort of things?"},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"Are you talking about\nannotations and post-it notes"},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"and things on PDFs?"},"549":{"dur":1,"text":"MARK NICHOLS: Well,\nPDFs are usually"},"551":{"dur":3,"text":"read through the Adobe\nAcrobat application."},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"And Adobe Acrobat has quite\na few features built into it."},"556":{"dur":1,"text":"So you can, for\nexample, highlight text."},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact, you've got\nmultiple color options."},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"You can also add comments."},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"It's got also a whole\nrange of different ways"},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"in which you can\nactually read a document."},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"You can read it as a\nsingle page at a time."},"568":{"dur":1,"text":"You can scroll it."},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"It's actually a very,\nvery powerful application"},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"once you get used to it."},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"It leads on to a tip\nthat I want to give"},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"later on as well, which\nrelates to developing"},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"confidence with online tools."},"579":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: OK."},"580":{"dur":0,"text":"Excellent."},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, organization was\nimportant for 20% of people."},"583":{"dur":3,"text":"And as these things always\nhappen, we're so short on time."},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"So I want to move\nnow into looking"},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"at skills for effective\nlearning and some"},"589":{"dur":3,"text":"of the technical skills\nthat people could look at."},"593":{"dur":1,"text":"We've been looking\nat study skills,"},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"obviously, with\nGeorgina, and thinking"},"596":{"dur":1,"text":"about how to focus things."},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"How to make the most of that\nstudy planner and sectioning"},"600":{"dur":1,"text":"things."},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"And as we can see,\nfocus and organization"},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"seem to be two of the key things\nthat our audience is struggling"},"606":{"dur":1,"text":"I wonder if you could\ntell us a little bit"},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"about personal strategies\nand how people can"},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"use that on screen environment."},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"So about how they can actually\nmake that work for them."},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"We've been talking about\nvarious readers beforehand"},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"and various assistive\ntechnologies that"},"620":{"dur":0,"text":"can be helpful."},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"But generally, how could\npeople make that work for them?"},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"MARK NICHOLS: I think\ntwo key ideas here would"},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"be orientation and confidence."},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"Orientation, I\nthink what we just"},"630":{"dur":1,"text":"looked at in the first session."},"631":{"dur":0,"text":"Get to know the VLE."},"632":{"dur":1,"text":"Get to know how\nit fits together."},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"Get to know where everything is."},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"Once you've got\nthat orientation,"},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"you tend to be able to\ndevelop a fairly good map as"},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"to what it is you need to do and\nwhich parts are more important."},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"But the confidence part\nis another key one."},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"I think many people have\na little bit of confidence"},"647":{"dur":1,"text":"when it comes to using\nonline technologies."},"648":{"dur":1,"text":"We mentioned earlier,\nthough, that most"},"650":{"dur":1,"text":"of the students\nwatching now will have"},"651":{"dur":0,"text":"a great deal of confidence."},"652":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Yeah."},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"MARK NICHOLS: But confidence\nis, I think, the number one"},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"asset for anyone wanting\nto use digital technology"},"657":{"dur":0,"text":"in education."},"658":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Brilliant."},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, as you said, being\nconfident is something"},"661":{"dur":1,"text":"our students are right now."},"663":{"dur":1,"text":"But also, it's something\nthat you can build on."},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's see then, what\nare the main three"},"667":{"dur":3,"text":"applications or websites that\npeople most use as students."},"670":{"dur":1,"text":"Because we've had\na lot of people"},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"fill these in, perhaps because\nthey're fairly tech savvy."},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"So we can see here module\nwebsites, Open University,"},"677":{"dur":3,"text":"Google, YouTube, OU Anywhere,\nStudent Home, museum websites,"},"681":{"dur":3,"text":"Wikipedia, Grammerly, regional\nforms, word processing,"},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"mind maps, Dropbox."},"685":{"dur":4,"text":"So a whole range here of both\nOU specific things, I guess,"},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"as well as various tools\nthat they're using."},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"And we'll talk a\nlittle bit later."},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"We've had some questions\nabout referencing tools."},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"We'll talk about that\nwith the library later."},"698":{"dur":3,"text":"But if you are\nconfident, how important"},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"is it to keep building\non those skills"},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"and honing your application?"},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"MARK NICHOLS: Vitally important."},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"I think if you're a confident\nuser of computer technologies,"},"708":{"dur":1,"text":"you should
