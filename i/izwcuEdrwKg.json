the\nphotoelectric effect, which was,"},"623":{"dur":5,"text":"you know getting very\ngroundbreaking paper."},"629":{"dur":6,"text":"He proposed the idea of photons,\nparticles of light, in

in"},"704":{"dur":4,"text":"doing the research for this\ntalk, that at point, the atomic"},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"theory was still controversial,\na lot of scientists thought

actually exist."},"748":{"dur":6,"text":"So, by the way, anybody can ask\nquestions whenever they want to."},"754":{"dur":4,"text":"Or tell jokes, as long as\nthey have to do with

here."},"789":{"dur":1,"text":"Where is it?"},"790":{"dur":0,"text":"I didn't put it on there."},"791":{"dur":0,"text":"Ok."},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a famous picture of\nEinstein standing at

one"},"801":{"dur":4,"text":"on the Capernaum Revolution,\nand one on his own odyssey of"},"806":{"dur":6,"text":"astronomy; anyway what he said\nwas, that by being there, it's

year"},"832":{"dur":2,"text":"on the electrodynamics\nof moving bodies."},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"And again, you can't really\ndecode that without knowing more"},"837":{"dur":2,"text":"about it, but this is the one\nin which he outlined his special"},"839":{"dur":2,"text":"theory of relativity."},"841":{"dur":2,"text":"So, you know what, we are going\nto do more with it later, so we"},"844":{"dur":2,"text":"are just going to kind of go on."},"846":{"dur":4,"text":"But it postulates, you\nknow, this is a big thing in"},"850":{"dur":3,"text":"relativity, postulative is an\nassumption, you just assume that"},"854":{"dur":2,"text":"something is true, and\nthen you see what"},"856":{"dur":1,"text":"are the consequences of that."},"858":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, if that's true, like\nthe time doesn't run at the same"},"861":{"dur":2,"text":"rate for everyone, you know,\nwhat does that really mean?"},"864":{"dur":2,"text":"That's not one of the\npostulates, but we'll see it as"},"866":{"dur":1,"text":"one of the consequences."},"868":{"dur":1,"text":"So, there's that."},"870":{"dur":2,"text":"And then the fourth paper\nyou might guess as general"},"872":{"dur":2,"text":"relativity, but you'd be wrong."},"874":{"dur":1,"text":"Ok."},"875":{"dur":1,"text":"Oops I didn't get there yet."},"876":{"dur":1,"text":"Ok, but one of the other\nconsequences like I already said"},"878":{"dur":2,"text":"is that all motion is relative."},"880":{"dur":2,"text":"Ok."},"882":{"dur":2,"text":"And time is different\nfor different people."},"885":{"dur":3,"text":"Right, and then finally the\nfourth paper is actually more of"},"889":{"dur":1,"text":"special relativity."},"890":{"dur":2,"text":"This is where we\nget to the final one."},"893":{"dur":1,"text":"I've put it on here twice now."},"895":{"dur":2,"text":"E=mcsquared, so\nlet's keep track."},"897":{"dur":5,"text":"So, does the inertia of a body\ndepend on its energy

version."},"912":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's look into it in a bit more\ndetail, and see what it's really"},"915":{"dur":1,"text":"all about."},"917":{"dur":3,"text":"So, you know, prove\nconsequences, paradoxes, and you"},"921":{"dur":3,"text":"know, I hope that somewhere in\nthere, if you've never really"},"924":{"dur":2,"text":"read or heard much about\nrelativity, you'll at least come"},"927":{"dur":3,"text":"to believe that it's true and\nhave some kind of understanding"},"930":{"dur":2,"text":"of it."},"933":{"dur":4,"text":"It is understandable actually."},"937":{"dur":2,"text":"Some parts are very weird."},"939":{"dur":1,"text":"Ok."},"941":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, let's start out here."},"943":{"dur":4,"text":"So, one of the postulates that\nhe came up with is the fact that"},"947":{"dur":3,"text":"the speed of light is the\nsame for all observers."},"950":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, You know, so what\ndoes that really mean?"},"954":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, let me just kind of\nbriefly explain that, right?"},"958":{"dur":4,"text":"So, let's say you are driving\ndown the road at sixty miles an"},"962":{"dur":3,"text":"hour, in your car, all these\nphysics 3 students are saying,"},"965":{"dur":1,"text":"oh, I've heard that one."},"967":{"dur":3,"text":"Anyway driving down the road

speed"},"1011":{"dur":1,"text":"will they see?"},"1013":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, do you add the sixty\nmiles per hour onto it or not,"},"1016":{"dur":2,"text":"the answer is not."},"1018":{"dur":4,"text":"In fact, the speed of light is\nthe same for all observers, and"},"1022":{"dur":4,"text":"this seems you know either\nimpossible, or just wrong, or"},"1027":{"dur":2,"text":"something, but we are\ngoing to see how it"},"1029":{"dur":1,"text":"can actually work out."},"1030":{"dur":4,"text":"And then there's,\nwe'll let's just do
