alarming."},"48":{"dur":2,"text":"Bacteria are rapidly becoming resistant"},"51":{"dur":2,"text":"to all of the antibiotics that we currently use."},"53":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, in order to understand\nthe nature of this problem,"},"57":{"dur":1,"text":"you have to understand bacteria."},"60":{"dur":3,"text":"We live in a world filled with bacteria."},"64":{"dur":2,"text":"Bacteria are everywhere."},"66":{"dur":2,"text":"Everything that you look at,"},"69":{"dur":1,"text":"everything you touch,"},"70":{"dur":1,"text":"everything you put in your mouth,"},"72":{"dur":2,"text":"everything you sit on"},"74":{"dur":3,"text":"is covered with millions and millions of bacteria."},"78":{"dur":1,"text":"They're so small"},"80":{"dur":2,"text":"that you can't see them\nwithout a microscope."},"82":{"dur":2,"text":"But they're there.\nAnd they are literally everywhere."},"85":{"dur":3,"text":"You can find them at the bottom\nof the deepest part of the ocean."},"88":{"dur":2,"text":"You can find them\nat the top of the tallest mountain."},"91":{"dur":2,"text":"You can even find them\nin the polar ice caps."},"93":{"dur":3,"text":"They can live in places\nwhere there is no sunlight,"},"97":{"dur":2,"text":"no oxygen, no food."},"99":{"dur":3,"text":"They can grow in radioactive waste,"},"103":{"dur":1,"text":"and in toxic chemicals,"},"104":{"dur":3,"text":"and in boiling hot springs."},"109":{"dur":3,"text":"When bacteria find a place\nwhere they can survive,"},"112":{"dur":3,"text":"they'll multiply fast to very high numbers."},"116":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, one of the places\nthat bacteria like to call home"},"119":{"dur":1,"text":"is the human body."},"121":{"dur":2,"text":"A recent survey by microbiologists"},"123":{"dur":3,"text":"identified over ten thousand different microbes"},"127":{"dur":2,"text":"that live on, or in the human body."},"130":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, there are more bacterial cells in you"},"134":{"dur":1,"text":"than there are human cells."},"135":{"dur":2,"text":"And there are more bacteria genes in you"},"137":{"dur":1,"text":"than human genes."},"139":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can argue that each one of you"},"141":{"dur":2,"text":"is actually more bacterium\nthan you are human."},"145":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"146":{"dur":2,"text":"So, now we have established that"},"149":{"dur":1,"text":"I am talking to a room full of bacteria --"},"151":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"152":{"dur":1,"text":"-- I'm going to flatter the audience\nhere a little bit"},"154":{"dur":4,"text":"and tell you that bacteria\nare amazing organisms."},"158":{"dur":3,"text":"And one of the things\nthat makes them so amazing"},"161":{"dur":2,"text":"is their ability to share genes\nwith each other."},"165":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, I need to describe this a little bit more."},"167":{"dur":2,"text":"Because this lies at the heart of how"},"170":{"dur":2,"text":"bacteria become resistant to antibiotics."},"175":{"dur":1,"text":"And I don't have any slides,"},"176":{"dur":1,"text":"so I'll have to describe it to you."},"180":{"dur":1,"text":"As you probably know:"},"182":{"dur":2,"text":"Who you are lies in your genes."},"184":{"dur":2,"text":"So, for example,\nif you're tall or you have blue eyes"},"187":{"dur":2,"text":"is because you have genes\nthat make you tall"},"189":{"dur":1,"text":"or that give you blue eyes."},"191":{"dur":3,"text":"And likewise bacteria that can live\nin Antarctica"},"194":{"dur":1,"text":"have genes that make them resistant\nto the cold."},"196":{"dur":3,"text":"And bacteria that are not killed by penicillin"},"199":{"dur":3,"text":"have genes that make them resistant\nto penicillin."},"204":{"dur":1,"text":"So where did these genes come from?"},"206":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, you are familiar with humans,"},"208":{"dur":2,"text":"who are born with a set of genes,"},"211":{"dur":1,"text":"that they inherit from their parents."},"212":{"dur":2,"text":"And they keep the same genes\nuntil the day that they die."},"214":{"dur":3,"text":"So, for example, if you're born\nwith brown eyes,"},"218":{"dur":2,"text":"even if you wish that you have blue eyes,"},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"your eyes will remain brown\nuntil the day that you die."},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"Because these were the genes\nthat you born with."},"227":{"dur":1,"text":"But this is not true for bacteria,"},"229":{"dur":2,"text":"who are in a habit of sharing\ngenes with each other"},"232":{"dur":2,"text":"in some pretty incredible ways."},"234":{"dur":1,"text":"And one of the ways"},"236":{"dur":2,"text":"the bacteria will share genes\nwith each other,"},"239":{"dur":3,"text":"is through picking genes up\nfrom their surroundings."},"243":{"dur":2,"text":"And they usually do this after\none of their neighbors has died."},"245":{"dur":4,"text":"So we're going to refer to this technique\nas the funeral grab."},"250":{"dur":2,"text":"OK, bacteria Number 1 dies"},"252":{"dur":2,"text":"and releases it's genes\ninto the surroundings,"},"255":{"dur":3,"text":"and now bacteria Number 2\nwill pick up some of these genes"},"258":{"dur":1,"text":"and pull them in."},"260":{"dur":3,"text":"So now bacteria Number 2\ncan do something"},"263":{"dur":2,"text":"that previously\nonly bacteria Number 1 could do."},"266":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is equivalent\nof you going to the funeral"},"269":{"dur":2,"text":"of someone who had blue eyes,"},"271":{"dur":2,"text":"taking a piece of their body out of the casket"},"273":{"dur":1,"text":"and eating it."},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"And hey! You have blue eyes too."},"277":{"dur":2,"text":"But now imagine that instead of blue eyes,"},"279":{"dur":2,"text":"you now are resistant to tetracycline."},"283":{"dur":1,"text":"Another way that bacteria have"},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"to share genes is through viruses."},"288":{"dur":3,"text":"So, yes, bacteria get\ntheir version of the flu too."},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"And there are a lot of viruses\nthat will infect bacteria."},"294":{"dur":3,"text":"So, we're going to call this technique:\nthe viral pass."},"298":{"dur":2,"text":"A virus will infect bacteria Number 1"},"301":{"dur":1,"text":"and pick up some of its genes,"},"303":{"dur":2,"text":"and then inject these genes\ninto bacteria Number 2."},"305":{"dur":2,"text":"Now bacteria Number 2\ncan do something"},"308":{"dur":2,"text":"that previously only bacteria Number 1\ncould do."},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is the equivalent\nof you catching the flu"},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"from someone who has blue eyes."},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"And after catch the flu,\nyour eyes turn blue too."},"319":{"dur":2,"text":"But, now imagine that instead of blue eyes,"},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"you're now resistant to methacycline."},"324":{"dur":3,"text":"And the third way that bacteria share genes\nis through sex."},"328":{"dur":1,"text":"So, yes, bacteria have sex too."},"330":{"dur":1,"text":"And they're actually pretty promiscuous."},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"So, we're going to refer to this technique"},"334":{"dur":1,"text":"as makin' whoopee.\n(Laughter)"},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"So bacteria Number 1, the donor,"},"338":{"dur":3,"text":"builds a bridge to bacteria Number 2,\nthe recipient,"},"342":{"dur":1,"text":"through which genes are passed"},"343":{"dur":1,"text":"from the donor to the recipient -"},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"much like sexual activity you're familiar with."},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"But at the end of this sexual activity,"},"350":{"dur":2,"text":"bacteria Number 2\ncan now do something,"},"352":{"dur":3,"text":"that previously only bacteria Number 1\ncould do before sex."},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is the equivalent of having sex\nwith the blue-eyed partner."},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"And after sex, you eyes turn blue too."},"362":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"But now imagine instead of blue eyes,"},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"now you are resistant to vancomycin."},"368":{"dur":0,"text":"(Laughter)"},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"So you see bacteria have lots of ways"},"371":{"dur":1,"text":"to share genes among each other."},"373":{"dur":3,"text":"And with over ten thousand\ndifferent types of bacteria"},"376":{"dur":1,"text":"in the human body alone,"},"378":{"dur":3,"text":"not to mention the millions\nof bacteria everywhere that you look,"},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"this is a huge community"},"384":{"dur":3,"text":"that's sharing antibiotic-resistant genes\nwith each other."},"388":{"dur":3,"text":"So, now in order to understand\nantibiotic resistence,"},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"you have to understand\nhow antibiotics actually work."},"394":{"dur":6,"text":"So, in many ways bacteria\nare very different than humans."},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"And what this means is they have\na lot of components"},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"that can be target by specific chemicals."},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"So antibiotics are fantastic drugs."},"408":{"dur":3,"text":"Because they can kill bacterium\nwithout harming the human"},"412":{"dur":3,"text":"by recognizing something very specific\nin the bacterium"},"415":{"dur":1,"text":"and not the human."},"417":{"dur":2,"text":"They work like a key and a lock,"},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"very specifically finding and binding their target"},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"which leads to inactivation of the bacterium."},"425":{"dur":1,"text":"But bacteria have evolved a number"},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"of different defensive maneuvers"},"429":{"dur":1,"text":"to avoid being killed by antibiotics."},"431":{"dur":1,"text":"So we're going to talk about three ways"},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"that bacteria can become resistant."},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"And the first way\nwe are going to call the \"up-chuck\"."},"438":{"dur":3,"text":"The antibiotic targets something specific"},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"inside the bacterial cell."},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"But as soon as the antibiotic gets inside,"},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"the bacterium barfs it right back out."},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"Preventing it from finding its target."},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"This is a technique that bacteria use"},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"to be resistant to tetracycline."},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"Another way we're going to call\nthe \"stealth mode\"."},"457":{"dur":5,"text":"So the antibiotic recognizes something\nspecifically again in the bacterial cell."},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"So the bacterium changes\nthe target just enough,"},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"so that the antibiotic no longer recognizes it."},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"The target is in stealth mode."},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"The antibiotic has no effect."},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"And the bacterium is resistant."},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"This is a technique that bacteria use"},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"to be resistant to streptomycin."},"479":{"dur":4,"text":"And the third way we're going to call\n\"the ballistic missile defense\"."},"483":{"dur":1,"text":"The bacteria makes a type of weapon"},"485":{"dur":1,"text":"that goes out and finds the antibiotic"},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"before the antibiotic can find its target."},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"The bacterium sends out waves of this missiles"},"493":{"dur":1,"text":"that breakdown the antibiotic"},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"and allow the bacterium to survive."},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is a technique that bacteria actually use"},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"to be resistant to penicillin."},"501":{"dur":1,"text":"So you can see that the bacteria have"},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"lots of simple and effective ways"},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"to avoid being killed by antibiotics,"},"507":{"dur":3,"text":"that include things like:\nupchucks, stealth modes"},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"and ballistic missiles."},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"And the genes for these\nantibiotic resistant mechanisms"},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"are shared among the bacteria."},"516":{"dur":4,"text":"Through funeral grabs, viral passes,\nand makin' whoopee."},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"So remember the important atributes\nof bacteria:"},"524":{"dur":1,"text":"they are small,"},"526":{"dur":3,"text":"they multiply fast,\nand they share genes."},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"Your body is chock-full"},"532":{"dur":3,"text":"of millions of good, innocent bacteria,"},"535":{"dur":1,"text":"that cause you no harm,"},"536":{"dur":4,"text":"they live in a peaceful\ngated community inside of you."},"540":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"542":{"dur":1,"text":"But now let's imagine that"},"544":{"dur":1,"text":"some bad bugs\nmove into this neighborhood,"},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"and start causing trouble,\nbeing obnoxious,"},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"playing loud music,\ntrashing the neighborhood."},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"You feel sick."},"552":{"dur":1,"text":"You go to the doctor."},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"You get some antibiotics,\nand you take them."},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"The antibiotics kill off\nmost of the bad bugs"},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"and a lot of good bugs as well."},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"So now you're feeling better,"},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"so you stop taking the antibiotics\nbefore the doctor prescribed."},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"So what happens next?"},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, let's say that one of the good bacteria\nwas already resistant."},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"So when half of the neighborhood dies off"},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"from this antibiotic armageddon,"},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"it multiplies fast to occupy\nall the empty houses."},"581":{"dur":3,"text":"As in any war, in order to win,"},"584":{"dur":3,"text":"we need to develop new\nand more powerful weapons"},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"to fight and defeat them."},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"And the time to invest\nin new antibiotic is now,"},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"before we're completely out of weapons."},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"This needs to be a continuous,\nsustained effort."},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"One that really should be considered"},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"a global health arms race."},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"With funding support,"},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"new antibiotic\ncan be developed continuously,"},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"and released continuously into the market."},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"As you can now appreciate,"},"611":{"dur":4,"text":"it is inevitable bacteria will eventually\nbecome resistant to the next antibiotic."},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"But by this time,\nthe next antibiotic will be ready."},"619":{"dur":1,"text":"A sobering thought is that"},"621":{"dur":1,"text":"a number of people in this room"},"623":{"dur":1,"text":"are only here today,"},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"because antibiotics saved your lives"},"626":{"dur":1,"text":"at some point in the past."},"628":{"dur":3,"text":"We need to avoid returning\nto the pre-antibiotic era,"},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"where common bacterial infections,"},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"resulting from things like a cut,\nor a scratch,"},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"or a struck throat,"},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"could sometimes be a death sentence."},"641":{"dur":3,"text":"In this manner, with new antibiotics,"},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"we can maintain the upper hand"},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"against the rise of the superbugs."},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you."},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"(Applause)"}}
