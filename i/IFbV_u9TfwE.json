things I\nthink we can all agree on"},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"is that travel is stressful."},"275":{"dur":1,"text":"There is no way around that."},"276":{"dur":1,"text":"And the first thing\nthat we have to do"},"278":{"dur":3,"text":"is recognize that\nand say to ourselves,"},"281":{"dur":1,"text":"why is travel stressful?"},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"Because as humans,\nwe are

whatever it is,"},"297":{"dur":2,"text":"So those are the\nexperiences we internalize"},"300":{"dur":2,"text":"and the experiences\nthat we remember."},"302":{"dur":1,"text":"And so we start to\nmake our decisions"},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"from this fear-based place\nof I don't want to do that."},"307":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't want to do that."},"308":{"dur":2,"text":"So let's talk a little\nbit

little bit."},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"That's not the typical workplace\nenvironment these days."},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"So people are taking\nthemselves from sitting"},"368":{"dur":3,"text":"behind a

right?"},"397":{"dur":3,"text":"You have to make sure\nyou're working very well."},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"But then you also have\nto make sure, like, oh,"},"402":{"dur":1,"text":"how am I going to

it"},"411":{"dur":2,"text":"comes to all of these\nthings, so our brain starts"},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"to work over time."},"415":{"dur":4,"text":"And our emotional state, we\nhave anxiety around

flying."},"458":{"dur":4,"text":"So that itself sets you\nup in a negative space"},"463":{"dur":1,"text":"before you've even taken off."},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"So these are all\nthings that we have"},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"to deal with when\nit comes to travel."},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"So why do we do it, right?"},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"Why do companies\nkeep sending us out?"},"472":{"dur":3,"text":"What is the benefit\nof business travel?"},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"And there are many benefits\nto business travel."},"478":{"dur":1,"text":"The biggest things\nhere are

to make"},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"it a little bit of a leisure\nand enjoyable experience"},"519":{"dur":3,"text":"at the same time, you will\nstick with your company longer."},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's great for\nthe company as well."},"524":{"dur":1,"text":"It increases productivity."},"526":{"dur":1,"text":"When you have\nface-to-face meetings"},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"and you're able

50%"},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"have admitted that while\non a conference call,"},"591":{"dur":1,"text":"they've been in the bathroom."},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm hoping that they\nwere on mute, right?"},"595":{"dur":1,"text":"Because nobody\nwants to hear that."},"597":{"dur":1,"text":"[LAUGHS] But these\nare the things"},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"that when you have face-to-face\nmeetings, they
