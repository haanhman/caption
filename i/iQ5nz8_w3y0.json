tasks"},"391":{"dur":1,"text":"that you can do all the time."},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"- I think one of the things\nthat makes it more complicated"},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"in the real world is that\nwe're doing these things"},"398":{"dur":1,"text":"in very different contexts."},"400":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's not like a repeated\nexperiment over and over

typically get."},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"- What do you think\nspecifically about learning\u2014"},"428":{"dur":0,"text":"I was just gonna ask Harry,"},"429":{"dur":1,"text":"is it one problem that\nwe think of learning"},"430":{"dur":3,"text":"as a discreet activity, and\ndoing as something different,"},"433":{"dur":3,"text":"and we don't think about\nlearning from doing?"},"436":{"dur":1,"text":"- I think a lot about\nlearning from doing. I mean,"},"438":{"dur":3,"text":"I think sometimes we spend\ntoo much time thinking"},"441":{"dur":1,"text":"about doing something"},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"and not enough time just doing it"},"444":{"dur":1,"text":"and saying, OK, what did I learn from it?"},"446":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think this iterative process of doing"},"448":{"dur":3,"text":"and collecting data and\nthen reflecting on it"},"451":{"dur":3,"text":"and, I think as Nancy said,\ngetting some feedback from others."},"454":{"dur":3,"text":"Or, my saying to George, when I did this"},"457":{"dur":1,"text":"I basically concluded X,"},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"and he said, well you could conclude Y,"},"462":{"dur":1,"text":"and I would say, gee, I\nnever thought about that."},"464":{"dur":3,"text":"So on we go. I go back and\nI may try something again."},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"So I think it is this iterative process"},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"that's very very valuable."},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"- I think the last part\nof that is really hard"},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"in an organization, which\nis after you do something"},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"to sit back and reflect\non what did I learn."},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"Either at the organization\nlevel or the individual."},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think companies are\nalways trying to figure out"},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"how to do that, how to add that last loop,"},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"because it's so important\nto share best practices."},"489":{"dur":3,"text":"It's so important for the next\nteam that's coming after you."},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"But in the day-to-day it's hard."},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"You kind of do it and move on."},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I think companies are\nreally trying to get people"},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"to sit down and think\nabout, what did I learn"},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"and what would the next step be"},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"as a result of the learning."},"504":{"dur":1,"text":"- Is it harder there to\nget people to analyze"},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"their success rather than their failures?"},"508":{"dur":1,"text":"- It depends on the company, I think,"},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"but a lot of companies\nlike to beat themselves up."},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"I know at Whirlpool we like to think a lot"},"515":{"dur":2,"text":"about what went wrong with the failures,"},"518":{"dur":1,"text":"but it's important to do both."},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"It's important to learn from both,"},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"and to make sure that you\ngeneralize those understandings"},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"and share them across the organization."},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"- Now this is an\nimportant point, I mean,"},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"sometimes people say to me, well,"},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"what if the experiment doesn't work out?"},"532":{"dur":1,"text":"And then I say, well then\nyou're not experimenting,"},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"because of a lot of\nexperiments don't work out,"},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's how you learn."},"537":{"dur":3,"text":"- Yeah, I think one idea\nand I think one thing"},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"that we're trying to teach people to do"},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"is to think about small-scale, low-cost experiments"},"547":{"dur":1,"text":"that they can do."},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think if they think\nabout trying a new skill"},"550":{"dur":4,"text":"in a really important situation\nwith a billion-dollar deal,"},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"that's not exactly the right place"},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"to try something new."},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"But in a conversation that you have some\u2014"},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"I have that conversation\nwith Nancy all the time,"},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"and why not try something new there?"},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"Or maybe even telegraph to her"},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"that I'm trying to do something."},"569":{"dur":1,"text":"- I'm sorry, George,"},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"I also like to compress the time."},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"I like for people when\nthey're experimenting"},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"with behaviors or innovation"},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"to think about 30-day, 60-day, 90-day,"},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"because when it gets beyond that"},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"it's so far out."},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"So what can you really\naccomplish in 90 days?"},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"And so pick one or two things,\nas each of you have said,"},"587":{"dur":1,"text":"and then just compress the time"},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"and just see what changes you can make."},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"- George, you talked earlier about"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"sort of technical skills\nand interpersonal skills"},"596":{"dur":1,"text":"as being distinct things."},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"What are the, which are kind of the ones"},"600":{"dur":1,"text":"that people have more problems with,"},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"and what are the basic skills\nthat you're talking about?"},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"- The technical skills, in some sense,"},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"those are ones where we\nthink of the classroom"},"610":{"dur":3,"text":"as being the place in which\nwe learn those kinds of things,"},"613":{"dur":3,"text":"so doing the models and learning\neconomics and operations"},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"and those kinds of things,\nand of course that's true,"},"620":{"dur":4,"text":"but I also think we learn\nthe interpersonal skills"},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"also in the classroom in a different way."},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"And one of the things"},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"that we do in our\nbehavioral-science classes"},"630":{"dur":3,"text":"is we teach people\ntheories about psychology"},"633":{"dur":3,"text":"and the idea is that when you try to learn,"},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"maybe one of the things\nthat's inhibiting your ability"},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"to learn is that there are all\nthese kinds of biases out there."},"643":{"dur":4,"text":"So I mean Nancy talked\nearlier about getting feedback,"},"647":{"dur":1,"text":"and I think that's very very important,"},"648":{"dur":1,"text":"and one of the reasons it's important"},"649":{"dur":3,"text":"is that you simply cannot\nsee things that others"},"652":{"dur":1,"text":"can see very easily."},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"And by asking others\nfor that kind of data\u2014"},"657":{"dur":3,"text":"you can try to collect data on yourself,"},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"but sometimes you're\njust gonna miss things"},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"that are very glaring to other people."},"667":{"dur":1,"text":"And those are the kinds\nof things that I think"},"669":{"dur":1,"text":"we try to make an impression about"},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"to our students in the classroom."},"673":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Hal] So is it just that people"},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"are unaware of how their\nactions are coming across?"},"677":{"dur":1,"text":"- I think they're unaware\nof them but they're also,"},"678":{"dur":3,"text":"I think there's an extent to\nwhich a lot of things"},"681":{"dur":1,"text":"are just simply hard."},"683":{"dur":3,"text":"So my colleague Nick\nEpley, among other things,"},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"has done studies about people's ability"},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"to tell whether people lie."},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"And many many years of studies say"},"695":{"dur":1,"text":"that people are very very bad at that."},"697":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's one of these things\nthat's extremely hard to learn"},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"whether you're good at doing this,"},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"and so really what I have to do is"},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"I have to tell you and\nask you in a situation,"},"708":{"dur":3,"text":"well, what did you really, I got this,"},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"what did you really mean?"},"713":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's not something\nthat you're typically"},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"gonna learn in the real world."},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"And in the laboratory you can\nlearn those kinds of things,"},"719":{"dur":1,"text":"but not in the real world."},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think that one of the things is that,"},"723":{"dur":4,"text":"given the fact that there\nare all these biases"},"727":{"dur":3,"text":"and reasons why we channel\nand take the information"},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"that we see and distort it,"},"732":{"dur":1,"text":"I think people have to\nknow about those things."},"734":{"dur":1,"text":"They have to collect the data"},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"but they also have to\nbe very wary about how"},"737":{"dur":3,"text":"they interpret it and look\nfor other ways of getting data"},"740":{"dur":3,"text":"that are kind of outside\nof their own vision."},"743":{"dur":0,"text":"- And I'll just add to that."},"744":{"dur":1,"text":"I think it's particularly\nimportant when you're working"},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"with very diverse people and environments"},"749":{"dur":1,"text":"and different cultures,"},"750":{"dur":1,"text":"because you really don't always know"},"752":{"dur":0,"text":"how you're coming across,"},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"so that feedback loop is really important."},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think to your question, Hal,"},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"that one of the things\npeople really struggle with"},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"is getting feedback is hard, you know."},"763":{"dur":1,"text":"Sometimes you don't want to hear it."},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"Sometimes, especially\nif you're in something"},"767":{"dur":3,"text":"that's a spiral down, you kinda\nwant to go in your bunker"},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"and not think about it."},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"And I always ask people\nto think about themselves"},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"maybe as an avatar, kind\nof remove themselves"},"776":{"dur":4,"text":"from that persona and\nthink about that feedback"},"781":{"dur":3,"text":"and how that might improve\nthat avatar, if you will,"},"784":{"dur":2,"text":"because getting feedback is really hard."},"787":{"dur":0,"text":"It's tough."},"788":{"dur":1,"text":"It's tough, especially when it's negative,"},"789":{"dur":3,"text":"and you're trying as hard as you can,"},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's just not coming across."},"794":{"dur":1,"text":"- And I think to some\nextent a lot of the feedback"},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"that is given is too aggregate,"},"799":{"dur":3,"text":"too removed from the context, too general."},"804":{"dur":2,"text":"I think we learn a lot from actually"},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"from the performance areas of the arts"},"808":{"dur":4,"text":"and I watch theater\ndirectors working with actors"},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"and they give very specific feedback"},"815":{"dur":3,"text":"in very small parts of the script"},"818":{"dur":1,"text":"that's being brought to life."},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"They don't at the end of a scene say, OK,"},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"now sit down, let me give\nyou 30 minutes of feedback."},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think to some extent"},"827":{"dur":3,"text":"our feedback mechanisms in organizations"},"831":{"dur":1,"text":"are not very helpful"},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"to get me to improve my performance."},"836":{"dur":3,"text":"I think that it raises\nsome interesting issues"},"839":{"dur":1,"text":"about feedback as a way"},"842":{"dur":2,"text":"of really improving day-to-day\nperformance and learning"},"844":{"dur":4,"text":"rather than some sort of\nmore bureaucratic evaluation."},"849":{"dur":1,"text":"- And I'll just add onto that"},"851":{"dur":1,"text":"the anonymous feedback you get."},"852":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, there's certainly a reason"},"854":{"dur":2,"text":"why organizations request anonymity,"},"856":{"dur":2,"text":"but I kind of grew up in a world"},"859":{"dur":1,"text":"where, when you were gonna\ngive someone
