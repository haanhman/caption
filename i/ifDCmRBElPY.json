long\nperiod of time,"},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"then the amounts get very,\nvery large very, very quickly."},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"But the point that\nI want to put to you"},"681":{"dur":3,"text":"is that you can compound\ngoodwill over time."},"685":{"dur":5,"text":"And so, as part of\nmy journey, I started"},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"in-- I ended up\nstarting to invest"},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"and I fell in love with Warren\nBuffett and Charlie Munger."},"697":{"dur":3,"text":"Anything Warren Buffett and\nCharlie Munger I'd consume it."},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"Charlie Munger gave\na talk where
