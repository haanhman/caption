Wexford."},"890":{"dur":2,"text":"And you always think\nyou might have some legacy"},"892":{"dur":1,"text":"you can leave the world behind,"},"894":{"dur":2,"text":"and I was thinking of humpback\nwhales breaching and dolphins."},"897":{"dur":2,"text":"But hey -- sometimes\nthese things are sent to you"},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"and you just have to take them\nwhen they come."},"901":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is possibly\ngoing to be my legacy --"},"903":{"dur":1,"text":"Simon's Shark Slime."},"905":{"dur":1,"text":"We got more money this year"},"907":{"dur":2,"text":"to carry on collecting\nmore and more samples."},"909":{"dur":2,"text":"One thing that is very useful\nis that we use a pole camera --"},"912":{"dur":2,"text":"this is my colleague, Joanne,\nwith a pole camera --"},"915":{"dur":1,"text":"where you can look underneath the shark."},"917":{"dur":2,"text":"What you're trying to look at is,\nthe males have claspers,"},"920":{"dur":2,"text":"which kind of dangle out\nbehind the back of the shark."},"922":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can quite easily tell\nthe gender of the shark."},"925":{"dur":3,"text":"If we can tell the gender of the shark\nbefore we sample it,"},"929":{"dur":3,"text":"we can tell the geneticist\nthis was taken from a male or a female."},"932":{"dur":2,"text":"Because in the

staggering,"},"938":{"dur":2,"text":"because they don't know\nwhat primers to look for."},"941":{"dur":2,"text":"Being able to tell the gender of a shark"},"943":{"dur":4,"text":"is very important\nfor things like policing the trade"},"947":{"dur":4,"text":"in basking shark and other species\nthrough the sightings,"},"952":{"dur":2,"text":"because it is illegal\nto trade in these
