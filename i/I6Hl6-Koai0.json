me."},"2619":{"dur":3,"text":"The first line of response, and the first response"},"2623":{"dur":1,"text":"is I think Hamilton's,"},"2625":{"dur":4,"text":"which is if you look through the argument

reasons."},"2641":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, I'm distilling them now."},"2642":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm translating them into modern parlance."},"2646":{"dur":3,"text":"One is, there will be agency problems

say, that was just too complicated,"},"2659":{"dur":2,"text":"so it's the federal government's fault."},"2661":{"dur":3,"text":"And the feds can always say when stuff fails,"},"2665":{"dur":1,"text":"well that was their fault."},"2666":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, they have these faithless agents."},"2670":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's the first reason."},"2672":{"dur":4,"text":"It's just an unbelievably expensive way of running things,"},"2676":{"dur":3,"text":"and irresponsibility is built into the system."},"2680":{"dur":1,"text":"And the second reason he gives you"},"2682":{"dur":4,"text":"is that the monitoring costs for private citizens"},"2686":{"dur":1,"text":"of these joint agreements,"},"2688":{"dur":2,"text":"of these

national program,"},"2784":{"dur":2,"text":"and I think that's the right way to go,"},"2787":{"dur":3,"text":"because the feds have huge comparative advantages."},"2791":{"dur":1,"text":"They can tax

harder,"},"2831":{"dur":3,"text":"we will figure out and all agree on what's national"},"2835":{"dur":2,"text":"and what's local, right?"},"2837":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think the first cup is to say,"},"2839":{"dur":2,"text":"let it be one or the other,"},"2842":{"dur":3,"text":"and then fight later on down the road over..."},"2847":{"dur":2,"text":"how exactly to organize
