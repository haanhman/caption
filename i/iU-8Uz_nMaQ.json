Classical\nliberalsists disagree about many things, but"},"14":{"dur":7,"text":"they agree, I think on ten 10 core principles.\nNumber one is that liberty is the primary"},"22":{"dur":5,"text":"political value. We all have lots of different\nvalues. We all care about our family, our"},"27":{"dur":4,"text":"church, but when it comes to deciding what\nto do politically, what should the government"},"32":{"dur":7,"text":"do; classical liberals have one clear standard.\nDoes this increase or does it reduce the freedom"},"40":{"dur":7,"text":"of the individual? The government should only\nact to prevent harm to others. Second principle:"},"47":{"dur":6,"text":"Individualism. That the individual is more\nimportant than the collective.

Power is the ability to get\nother people to do what you want that otherwise"},"80":{"dur":5,"text":"they would not do.

Whereas very often, when people in"},"92":{"dur":5,"text":"power do that, it's really because it's good\nfor themselves. Classical liberals believe"},"98":{"dur":5,"text":"that the individual is the best judge of their\nown interests. We can try and recommend things,"},"103":{"dur":5,"text":"but in the end the individual is the best\njudge of their own interests. Other people"},"109":{"dur":6,"text":"should not force them to do things that they\ndo not want to do. Fourth: The rule of law."},"115":{"dur":5,"text":"This is the idea that there are some higher\nprinciples by which we should examine what"},"120":{"dur":5,"text":"government does, laws that are passed, and\ngovernment actions, just like the U.S. Supreme"},"126":{"dur":6,"text":"Court will sometimes strike down pieces of\nlegislation that Congress has passed and the"},"132":{"dur":7,"text":"president has signed because it goes against\ncertain principles embodied in the U.S. Constitution."},"140":{"dur":4,"text":"Classical liberals believe that the certain\nprinciples of the rule of law should be applied"},"144":{"dur":5,"text":"to the rule of law to what every government\ndoes anywhere in the world. A classic example"},"149":{"dur":5,"text":"is equality before the law. People should\nbe treated the same regardless of their race"},"155":{"dur":5,"text":"or gender or sexual orientation. That's why\nclassical liberalists have always objected"},"161":{"dur":4,"text":"to the idea that there should be laws that\npeople should treat, say, blacks and whites"},"165":{"dur":7,"text":"differently. Five: Civil society. Civil society\nare those voluntary organizations that exist"},"173":{"dur":7,"text":"between the individual and the state.

Order it means the existence of regularity"},"217":{"dur":4,"text":"and predictability in the world. When people\nare making decisions about what to do, they"},"222":{"dur":5,"text":"need to be able to predict what the results\nof making those decisions should be. Many"},"227":{"dur":6,"text":"people seem to assume that order requires\nsome institution, somebody to manipulate and"},"234":{"dur":5,"text":"organize things. Classical liberals don t\nbelieve that. They believe that order can"},"239":{"dur":5,"text":"arise spontaneously. People through their\nvoluntary interaction create the rules by"},"245":{"dur":7,"text":"which people can live by. A classic example\nis that of language. Nobody invented the English"},"252":{"dur":5,"text":"language. It arose in terms of people communicating\nwith each other. And yet certain rules have"},"257":{"dur":8,"text":"applied through that process. We don t need\npeople to plan our lives. Seven: Free markets."},"266":{"dur":5,"text":"Thate economic exchange should be left to\nvoluntary activity between individuals. Government"},"272":{"dur":6,"text":"should not tell people what to wear to work,\nhow to save, what to build, what to produce."},"278":{"dur":5,"text":"This should be left to voluntary interaction\nby people. You need private property to be"},"283":{"dur":3,"text":"able to do that, and you need to\nensure that when there are disputes, they"},"287":{"dur":6,"text":"can be peacefully resolved. But history shows\nus that leaving things to free markets rather"},"294":{"dur":7,"text":"than government planning or organization increases\nprosperity, reduces poverty, increases jobs."},"302":{"dur":7,"text":"It provides goods that people want to buy.\nEight: Toleration. Toleration is the belief"},"310":{"dur":6,"text":"that one should not interfere with things\nof which one disapproves. Toleration does"},"316":{"dur":4,"text":"not mean that you allow people to do things\nbecause you agree with it, because you think"},"321":{"dur":5,"text":"it's a good thing. It s a question of having\ncertain moral principles. I think this action"},"326":{"dur":7,"text":"is wrong, but I will not try and force my\nopinions, for example, through government,"},"333":{"dur":5,"text":"to stop the things that I disapprove\nof. A classic case of that for classical liberals"},"339":{"dur":5,"text":"is free speech. People should be allowed to\nsay things of which we strongly disapprove."},"345":{"dur":7,"text":"We're tolerating tolerate things even though\nwe dislike and disapprove it. Nine: Peace."},"353":{"dur":6,"text":"Peace is a state where we can go about our\nbusiness without violence or war. That's best"},"360":{"dur":4,"text":"achieved, according to classical liberals,\nis not by interfering in other countries."},"364":{"dur":6,"text":"In other words, they favor a non interventionist\nforeign policy. Their view in terms of our"},"371":{"dur":4,"text":"interactions, it should be with other nations\nis based on what's commonly called the four"},"376":{"dur":6,"text":"freedoms. There should be free movement of\ncapital and labor, people, goods, and services."},"383":{"dur":5,"text":"And I would add something as well, the free\nmovement of ideas. If we have a world in which"},"388":{"dur":4,"text":"this free movement is embraced, then I think\nwe ll have a world, classical liberals believe"},"393":{"dur":7,"text":"we would have a world based on peace. And\nfinally, limited government. There are very"},"400":{"dur":5,"text":"few things which the government should do.\nThe goal of the government is simply to protect"},"406":{"dur":7,"text":"our life, liberty, and property. And anything\nbeyond that is not justifiable; a strictly"},"414":{"dur":6,"text":"limited government. So these are the ten 10\nprinciples of classical liberalism. Are you"},"420":{"dur":0,"text":"a classical liberal?"}}
