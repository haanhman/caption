the idea of having a space\nwhere anybody in the city"},"284":{"dur":2,"text":"can come free to\nall to get access"},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"to information or knowledge\nseemed radical at the

information\nthat has been stored up here."},"332":{"dur":6,"text":"And this is one of the ways in\nwhich the book is in a sense,"},"338":{"dur":3,"text":"although not directly, it's\nconcerned with the notion"},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"that the people who are\nholding the information"},"344":{"dur":1,"text":"are in the private sector."},"345":{"dur":1,"text":"And that includes\nyou guys and

field."},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"And actually that is one\nof the arguments, which"},"364":{"dur":1,"text":"is to think about how\ndo we ensure that there"},"366":{"dur":3,"text":"is a public option in

things, it actually"},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"becomes trickier for\nlibraries to do what"},"398":{"dur":1,"text":"they have done traditionally."},"399":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm just curious, actually,\nbecause I'm doing this"},"401":{"dur":1,"text":"at each of the talks."},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"How many people prefer to\nread a physical form of a book"},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"like this

otherwise very easily."},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"One of the problems is\nthat publishers have not"},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"been willing,\ntraditionally, to allow"},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"libraries to lend\non the same basis"},"499":{"dur":1,"text":"that they have in the past."},"500":{"dur":1,"text":"Many of the publishers\nhave said no."},"502":{"dur":1,"text":"Even with our most\npopular

the digital era, that\nisn't necessarily true."},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"And by and large, the contracts\nthat libraries are getting"},"537":{"dur":1,"text":"do not allow them\nultimately to
