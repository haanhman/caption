And I'm"},"165":{"dur":4,"text":"going to share with you some thoughts from\nthe system level about the importance of this"},"169":{"dur":3,"text":"work. But before I do, I want to pick up on\nsomething that you just heard Frank Lamas"},"173":{"dur":5,"text":"mention, which is the money that the System\nOffice sends around for student success. For"},"178":{"dur":5,"text":"a while, that was our Chancellor's discretion.\nHe was doing that because he believed in it,"},"184":{"dur":5,"text":"and we were pulling out of a horrible recession\nthat had cut many of the things that our students"},"189":{"dur":7,"text":"count on the most to succeed. And so he set\naside several million in different pots of"},"196":{"dur":4,"text":"money that we were able to distribute. We\nasked the campuses at the time to keep track"},"201":{"dur":6,"text":"of what the benefits were from investments\nlike that. And Fresno did an unusually good"},"208":{"dur":6,"text":"job of helping us tell our story. And so today\nthe latest increment we got for student success"},"215":{"dur":3,"text":"funding, it wasn't a few million dollars because\nthe Chancellor felt strongly about it. It"},"219":{"dur":6,"text":"was from the State of California.

So here's"},"301":{"dur":4,"text":"our seal, and here's our mission. I'm going\nto quote to you -- this is from our web page."},"305":{"dur":8,"text":"This is calstate.edu. You probably don't have\nit bookmarked in your browser. So I won't"},"313":{"dur":5,"text":"ask you to join in a recitation. Instead,\nI'll just put it up on screen. So number one"},"319":{"dur":7,"text":"in our mission, \"To prepare significant numbers\nof educated, responsible people to contribute"},"327":{"dur":16,"text":"to California's schools, economy, culture,\nand future.\" That's it.

That it's really good, that it's"},"382":{"dur":7,"text":"really good for the State. And that it's,\nto an unprecedented degree, available to a"},"389":{"dur":7,"text":"wide range of people. The intellectual and\npersonal development we offer to the whole"},"396":{"dur":9,"text":"spectrum of the people who live in California,\nI find moving. I really do. And so it bugs"},"406":{"dur":3,"text":"me when we don't do better, when we don't\nhave higher graduation rates. When we have"},"410":{"dur":5,"text":"persistent achievement gaps. It really does\nkind of haunt me. And I suspect it haunts"},"415":{"dur":5,"text":"many of us. And so this intentional, concerted\nwork you folks are doing in cooperation with"},"421":{"dur":8,"text":"each other to fix that is important. It's\nmeaningful. I'm going to quote our web page"},"429":{"dur":5,"text":"with one other fact for you. Here's what we\ncontribute to the State of California. Now,"},"434":{"dur":4,"text":"note this chart is not, what are the degrees\nwe produce. This is, of the people who work"},"439":{"dur":8,"text":"in California in these industries, how many\nof those degrees were earned at the CSU? And"},"447":{"dur":5,"text":"so what you see is, well over half of the\npeople who work in agriculture, hospitality"},"453":{"dur":9,"text":"and tourism and business are CSU alumni. More\nthan half. And you've probably had this experience"},"463":{"dur":5,"text":"too. As I travel around, I know there are\ncertain people I'll interact with where the"},"468":{"dur":5,"text":"odds are better than half that when they see\nmy business card or when I register for something,"},"474":{"dur":6,"text":"they'll go, \"Oh, I went to the CSU.\" It's\na huge, huge reach. And those are our big"},"480":{"dur":5,"text":"output, the contributions to the state -- agriculture,\nbusiness, health\/medicine, hospitality, tourism,"},"485":{"dur":5,"text":"engineering, media, culture and design. And\nlike you heard earlier, these were a lot of"},"490":{"dur":4,"text":"folks who didn't even plan to go to college.\nThose are really good jobs. That's kind of"},"495":{"dur":6,"text":"out the back door. Coming in the front door,\nthat mission of access. Californians from"},"501":{"dur":6,"text":"different ethnic, socioeconomic and educational\nbackgrounds. Making it the most diverse university"},"507":{"dur":4,"text":"system in the country. And this is a country\nthat's getting more and more diverse all the"},"511":{"dur":8,"text":"time. So they look at us to figure out how\nto do better. We are their future. CSU has"},"520":{"dur":5,"text":"significant academic preparation and outreach\nprograms. Like that barnstorming tour you"},"525":{"dur":5,"text":"just heard about through the central valley.\nReaching out to those communities, making"},"531":{"dur":3,"text":"sure they understand they really are welcome\nhere. And here's how best to position yourself"},"535":{"dur":6,"text":"to succeed. And then on top of that we have\na massive transfer mission. Every year the"},"542":{"dur":6,"text":"graduating class at the system level, more\nthan 60% of them began somewhere else, almost"},"548":{"dur":5,"text":"all of them at California community colleges.\nSo some of those programs that can set our"},"554":{"dur":6,"text":"teeth on edge, like Associate degrees for\ntransfer. Where all of a sudden we're like"},"560":{"dur":5,"text":"bending our curriculum to try to fit some\nabstracted model of what curriculum should"},"565":{"dur":6,"text":"look like. There's an upside to that. You\nknow, it's painful and it doesn't always end"},"571":{"dur":4,"text":"up where you feel like your students are in\na better place than they were at the beginning."},"576":{"dur":8,"text":"But on the whole, at the State level, that's\nsuch a win as far as the access, the affordability,"},"584":{"dur":10,"text":"the ability of a student to finish in a reasonable\namount of time. So that's kind of who we are"},"595":{"dur":5,"text":"and what we're up to. About a month ago, the\nChancellor, Tim White, was giving an address"},"600":{"dur":7,"text":"he gives every year in January called \"The\nState of the CSU.\" This is his performance"},"607":{"dur":5,"text":"report to his bosses. He makes this report\nto the Board of Trustees. It's heavily covered"},"613":{"dur":9,"text":"by the press. This headline says, \"CSU Chancellor,\nTimothy White evokes moon race in charting"},"622":{"dur":17,"text":"the future.\" Here's what he said."},"640":{"dur":12,"text":"[ Silence ]"},"652":{"dur":4,"text":"So I work on student success. I work on the\ngraduation initiative. And I heard that, and"},"656":{"dur":10,"text":"I just thought, are you kidding me? Do you\nhave any idea how baked into the system those"},"667":{"dur":7,"text":"gaps are? The CSU, by the time we get them\nthey're 18 at the youngest. We're supposed"},"675":{"dur":7,"text":"to overcome a lifetime of societal inequity?\nOf imbalances in school districts? Of different"},"682":{"dur":11,"text":"cultural expectations? But then my second\nthought was, what if we did? I mean, if anyone"},"693":{"dur":12,"text":"can do it it's us. And in fact there are pockets\nof work on this very campus. On this very"},"706":{"dur":10,"text":"campus, where that has happened. I will get\nto that in a moment. First, here's that \"High"},"716":{"dur":4,"text":"Impact Practices\" book. Around the time we\nlaunched our graduation initiative, this book"},"721":{"dur":5,"text":"came out. Written by George Kuh, whose name\nyou heard Frank Lamas use a moment ago. And"},"726":{"dur":6,"text":"what he was talking about under the label,\n\"high impact practices\" was really stuff most"},"732":{"dur":3,"text":"of us have known about for a lot longer than\nthe time since this book came out. It's just"},"736":{"dur":5,"text":"what happens when you get students up out\nof their chairs, right? It's experiential"},"741":{"dur":8,"text":"learning. It's hands-on learning. It's internships.\nThe list is -- there's civic engagement, service"},"749":{"dur":6,"text":"learning, peer mentoring, learning communities,\nwork-based learning, collaborating with faculty"},"756":{"dur":5,"text":"on their research. We used to think of these\nas all different. Some of them were for students"},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"who were struggling. Some were for your star\nstudents if you wanted to pull them aside"},"765":{"dur":5,"text":"and put them in a lab with you. What this\nbook claimed was that these various high-impact"},"771":{"dur":8,"text":"practices actually have some properties in\ncommon that hadn't been noticed before. They"},"779":{"dur":6,"text":"improve persistence. They improve learning.\nAnd they even seem to have a disproportionate"},"786":{"dur":8,"text":"benefit for the students who are least likely\nto succeed. Because of their academic records,"},"794":{"dur":4,"text":"because they're from backgrounds where higher\ned has just had a very hard time serving students"},"799":{"dur":6,"text":"from those backgrounds. In other words, they\nwere grad rate boosters. And gap closers."},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"And since we had just launched our graduation\ninitiative where those were our two goals,"},"809":{"dur":5,"text":"we had to pay attention. And the director\nof institutional research at one of our campuses,"},"814":{"dur":7,"text":"Cal State-Northridge, correlated student survey\ndata with student graduation rate data to"},"821":{"dur":4,"text":"see if it was true. And the survey was, did\nyou participate in any of these high-impact"},"826":{"dur":3,"text":"practices? And then the graduate data, she\nwould just match that back to the records"},"830":{"dur":7,"text":"to see if they ever got out. Here's what she\nfound. The number at the base of each of those"},"837":{"dur":7,"text":"columns is how many high-impact practices\nthe students had reported participating in."},"845":{"dur":6,"text":"And what you see is, when it's zero the six-year\ngrad rate is 38% for the Latino students and"},"851":{"dur":8,"text":"55 for everybody else. Pretty typical for\nthe CSU. But then look what happens when they"},"860":{"dur":7,"text":"participate in one. And look at what happens\nat two. At both the rate and the difference"},"868":{"dur":8,"text":"in those rates. That's down to a three-point\ndifference. So we were pretty excited. We"},"877":{"dur":5,"text":"had this national publication saying, here's\na way to have it both ways. You can run up"},"882":{"dur":7,"text":"your grad rates and close your gaps. And you're\nnot watering anything down. In fact, you're"},"889":{"dur":5,"text":"making it more engaging, more rigorous, more\ncompelling. That's what's bringing them back."},"894":{"dur":4,"text":"Because learning this way, as you know if\nyou've been involved in high-impact practices,"},"899":{"dur":4,"text":"it's hard. It's really challenging. It's exhausting.\nBut at the end of it you feel like you grew,"},"903":{"dur":6,"text":"and you want to try it again. That's what\nwe were finding. And yet -- I don't have to"},"910":{"dur":4,"text":"tell you because you're all educated critical\nthinkers -- there's all kinds of problems"},"914":{"dur":6,"text":"with this data. Some of it may already have\noccurred to you, like selection bias, right?"},"921":{"dur":4,"text":"Like if I'm looking at the kids who signed\nup for two high impact practices, aren't I"},"926":{"dur":6,"text":"looking at the kids who are going to graduate\nno matter what? Northridge could have offered"},"932":{"dur":5,"text":"no high impact practices and those kids were\ngoing to graduate. So you can't really talk"},"937":{"dur":5,"text":"about cause and effect. Now, the IR director\nthere had done some work to control for such"},"942":{"dur":5,"text":"things, matching students apples-to-apples\nby academic preparation, by other elements"},"948":{"dur":5,"text":"in their background other than Latino or not.\nAnd so we're pretty confident that she had"},"953":{"dur":4,"text":"ironed out as much of that as she can. But\nthe suspicion still has to remain that you"},"958":{"dur":5,"text":"can't really hang a whole policy on it. Second,\nit's survey data. So years after the fact,"},"964":{"dur":5,"text":"you're asking a graduating senior, did you\never do a freshman learning community? And"},"969":{"dur":8,"text":"they're like, oh, yeah. So there too, you\ndon't really want to hang a policy on it."},"978":{"dur":6,"text":"I would say that what you can say about this\nchart is that it tells a hopeful story about"},"984":{"dur":4,"text":"the intersection between powerful learning\nand student success. The same intersection"},"989":{"dur":6,"text":"that I would say is epitomized in this very\nmeeting. Because it's co-hosted by your Provost"},"996":{"dur":5,"text":"and your Vice President of Student Affairs.\nIn that intersection, in that cooperation"},"1001":{"dur":5,"text":"across divisions that in most higher ed institutions\ndon't cooperate all that often, is where the"},"1007":{"dur":6,"text":"magic happens. Is where the student experience\nmaterially changes. And suddenly they're pulled"},"1014":{"dur":10,"text":"into it. That's what we thought we saw in\nthis. Or at least this gave us plausible reason"},"1024":{"dur":4,"text":"to confirm what many of us who've ever taught\nalready believed intuitively. Like, you've"},"1029":{"dur":7,"text":"had that experience when you interact with\nstudents. So we set about with an increment"},"1036":{"dur":6,"text":"of funding from the Chancellor to try to answer\nthis question. What if we didn't have to ask"},"1042":{"dur":3,"text":"the students on a survey years later, \"Did\nyou ever do such-and-such?\" What if we could"},"1046":{"dur":8,"text":"just keep track of it? Really rigorously and\nunambiguously. It's hard to do. If you ask"},"1054":{"dur":6,"text":"a roomful of a thousand faculty members and\nstudent affairs people, do you do high-impact"},"1060":{"dur":6,"text":"practices? A thousand hands will go into the\nair, right? No one's going to say, no, I'm"},"1067":{"dur":7,"text":"actually proud of my low-impact work for students.\nSo we had to have something where you could"},"1074":{"dur":6,"text":"say yes or no. This one is. This one might\nbe very good, but it doesn't count by this"},"1081":{"dur":7,"text":"metric. So this student is in our control\ngroup. It's a necessary first step, is having"},"1088":{"dur":8,"text":"hard conversations. At the institutional level.\nAbout what counts. What do we all believe"},"1097":{"dur":7,"text":"makes a difference? So we convened the recipients\nof one of the Chancellor's allocations a couple"},"1105":{"dur":5,"text":"of years ago. To develop definitions of these\nwhere you could actually test the student"},"1110":{"dur":5,"text":"experience against the definition and end\nup with a yes or no, did this happen? And"},"1115":{"dur":4,"text":"they were from different campuses. So we were\ntrying to wash out local idiosyncrasies. And"},"1120":{"dur":4,"text":"we developed these things called \"taxonomies.\"\nMany of you in this room were involved in"},"1124":{"dur":4,"text":"those. At the top part of the page is the\nbare minimum definition. You've got to have"},"1128":{"dur":5,"text":"these three things. I think that one is Summer\nBridge.

And then the bottom\npart, those low intensity, medium intensity,"},"1164":{"dur":5,"text":"high intensity columns, that's where you can\ntell us the local story. So we have Summer"},"1169":{"dur":5,"text":"Bridge, it passes those four tests. And then\nwithin that we have an unusually high amount"},"1175":{"dur":6,"text":"of faculty involvement. And an unusually low\namount of days on campus, because we're in"},"1181":{"dur":9,"text":"a remote area. But it works for us. That was\nkind of what we were picturing.
