talking to you."},"61":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm a Principal Solutions Architect\nat Modality Systems, Tom Arbuthnot."},"65":{"dur":4,"text":"So, my world is pretty much\nUnified Communications and

out."},"104":{"dur":1,"text":"So, what are we going\nto cover today?"},"106":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, first off we're\ngonna level set with"},"108":{"dur":2,"text":"just what PSTN Conferencing is."},"110":{"dur":2,"text":"Make sure we all understand what\nwe're talking about when we mean"},"113":{"dur":0,"text":"PSTN Conferencing."},"114":{"dur":4,"text":"And some people do get confused\naround audio versus PSTN."},"118":{"dur":2,"text":"We're gonna talk about what\nthat means on server and"},"121":{"dur":2,"text":"what that means on Skype for\nBusiness Online."},"124":{"dur":2,"text":"We're then going to dive\na bit more detailed"},"126":{"dur":3,"text":"into the Microsoft PSTN\nConferencing Service."},"130":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's the service that connects\nOffice 365 to give you PSTN"},"133":{"dur":1,"text":"conferencing."},"135":{"dur":2,"text":"And we'll look at\nthe commercial model,"},"137":{"dur":4,"text":"how the coverage works in terms\nof dial in numbers and countries."},"141":{"dur":2,"text":"And also a new feature that's\njust dropped recently,"},"144":{"dur":4,"text":"which is dynamic\nmeeting conference

PowerShell,\nhow you set up conferencing for"},"163":{"dur":2,"text":"that and then we're gonna\njump into the portal and"},"165":{"dur":5,"text":"see how all the settings are set up."},"171":{"dur":2,"text":"So what is PSTN conferencing?"},"173":{"dur":3,"text":"Well I've done a few screen\nshots here, but essentially"},"176":{"dur":5,"text":"it's the ability to use a regular\nphone and dial into a meeting."},"181":{"dur":4,"text":"But not just dial in to a meeting\nalso users in that meeting"},"186":{"dur":4,"text":"having the ability to dial out\nto phone users or to have Skype"},"191":{"dur":3,"text":"call you back on your PSTN number\nand bring you into the meeting."},"195":{"dur":4,"text":"So on the slide here you've got the\nfirst screenshot there is a Skype"},"200":{"dur":2,"text":"meeting without PSTN conferencing."},"202":{"dur":4,"text":"So by default out of the box on\nserver if you don't set it up or"},"206":{"dur":3,"text":"on Skype for Business online if\nyou don't add PSTN conferencing,"},"210":{"dur":3,"text":"what you'll get in your invite\nis a meeting join link."},"213":{"dur":5,"text":"You click that, Skype client pops up\nand you're joining audio via VoIP."},"218":{"dur":1,"text":"So over your PC."},"220":{"dur":3,"text":"It works great,\nit doesn't cost any money, but"},"223":{"dur":3,"text":"that's the default\nmethods during a meeting."},"226":{"dur":3,"text":"But there are scenarios where people\nneed a dial in number, and so"},"230":{"dur":2,"text":"if you want that service,\nthe next screenshot"},"233":{"dur":3,"text":"is where you see some dial in\nnumbers on the meeting invite, and"},"237":{"dur":2,"text":"you see a link to find more numbers."},"240":{"dur":2,"text":"And that allows anybody who\nwants to dial in on a phone to"},"242":{"dur":1,"text":"find a number and\nget into the meeting."},"246":{"dur":3,"text":"Last two screenshots\nare showing in a meeting."},"249":{"dur":4,"text":"So let's say, for example, I'm at\nModality, I pull a couple of my"},"254":{"dur":3,"text":"colleagues into a meeting,\nwe us VoIP by default, but"},"257":{"dur":3,"text":"then I want to pull in a sales guy,\nwho's on the road."},"261":{"dur":3,"text":"Easiest way to pull him in is\njust to add his mobile number to"},"264":{"dur":1,"text":"the meeting."},"266":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I add a participant, and\ninstead of typing a CPRI,"},"270":{"dur":3,"text":"I type in a regular phone number,\nclick connect, and"},"274":{"dur":4,"text":"the conferencing in to you,\nthe server, or Skype if it's online,"},"278":{"dur":3,"text":"is going to dial that number and\nbring that person into the meeting."},"283":{"dur":4,"text":"And then the last one is telling\nSkype Business client for"},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"whatever reason,\nI don't want to join on VoIP,"},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"I want you to ring my phone and\nbring me into the meeting and"},"293":{"dur":1,"text":"you can set that as\na default preference."},"295":{"dur":3,"text":"So, let's say you have a desk phone,\nyou haven't got a headset."},"299":{"dur":3,"text":"Whatever the reason, you want\nSkype to dial you into meetings."},"302":{"dur":0,"text":"You can make it do that."},"306":{"dur":4,"text":"Just a note on the bullets there,\nyou don't need Enterprise Voice or"},"310":{"dur":3,"text":"Cloud PBX to have PSTN calling."},"314":{"dur":5,"text":"So often in the Skype world, people\nwill maybe start an online presence,"},"319":{"dur":2,"text":"then go to conferencing,\nthen go to Enterprise Voice."},"322":{"dur":1,"text":"You don't need to to\nEnterprise Voice or"},"324":{"dur":2,"text":"Cloud PBX to add that\ndial in feature."},"326":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you're using Skype today and\nyou're using it for"},"329":{"dur":3,"text":"maybe internal meetings on VoIP,\nthis session will show you how you"},"333":{"dur":3,"text":"can potentially add PSD and\nconferencing and make more use of it"},"336":{"dur":3,"text":"because it will be more applicable\nto more meeting scenarios."},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"So why is PSTN\nconferencing important?"},"345":{"dur":5,"text":"We're here at a Microsoft event,\nit's all technology, obviously"},"350":{"dur":4,"text":"VoIP and voice-over IP, and\nconferencing over IP is the future."},"354":{"dur":2,"text":"Why do we even need to worry\nabout PSTN conferencing?"},"357":{"dur":3,"text":"There's a few good reasons and\nmainly it comes about"},"361":{"dur":3,"text":"making sure you can meet\nall your meeting scenarios."},"364":{"dur":4,"text":"So if you've got a PSTN phone number\nfor conferences, anybody can join."},"370":{"dur":4,"text":"I took a nice picture there of\na classic collaboration device that"},"374":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm sure maybe some of you are still\nusing, maybe not, hopefully not."},"378":{"dur":4,"text":"But genuinely, that old school phone"},"382":{"dur":4,"text":"can join a Skype meeting if we\nhave PSTN Conferencing enabled."},"387":{"dur":3,"text":"So you're allowing anybody to join\nno matter what technology they have."},"393":{"dur":3,"text":"If you're looking to move to\nSkype from a different system,"},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"odds are that's gonna have\nPSTN Conferencing on it."},"399":{"dur":3,"text":"So you want to have the same ability"},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"as your previous system when\nyou're pushing out to users."},"406":{"dur":3,"text":"It's no good users having maybe\nan external service that has dial-in"},"410":{"dur":3,"text":"numbers and then you give them\nSkype without dial-in numbers."},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"Because their always going to say,\nwell but"},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"you know some of my users maybe\nperhaps want to join on phone or"},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"there's the odd time where\nI want to pull somebody in."},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"So until you give\nme dial in numbers,"},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm just going to keep\nusing my old service."},"427":{"dur":3,"text":"Two common scenarios, even for\nthose that are kind of Skype and"},"431":{"dur":1,"text":"VoIP first."},"432":{"dur":2,"text":"Join mobile with no data."},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm traveling,\nI'm based in London."},"437":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm traveling at the moment,\ndata rates can be expensive."},"441":{"dur":3,"text":"Maybe I just want to join on\na phone call to my meeting."},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't want to spend all\nthat data on the mobile."},"446":{"dur":1,"text":"I just want to dial in and\ndo a permanent."},"449":{"dur":5,"text":"And also, just a back up scenario,\nflaky WiFi, flaky network,"},"455":{"dur":4,"text":"want to guarantee the experience,\ndialing in is still a good option."},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can dial in and\nstill see desktop sharing."},"461":{"dur":3,"text":"So you could use, if the network\nconnection isn't good enough for"},"464":{"dur":3,"text":"real time audio, but maybe you can\nget away with desktop sharing."},"467":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe you join on the phone for\naudio and"},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"you do desktop sharing\nstill in Skype."},"474":{"dur":3,"text":"Well there's two\nscenarios basically,"},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"there's server and\nthen there's online."},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"So first we're gonna take\na high-level look at sever, and"},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"then a high-level look at online."},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'm guessing a few people in\nthe room are familiar with Server."},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"We're not gonna go into the depths\nof Server in this session."},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"But this is just a rundown of\nsort of the high level tasks"},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"you need to do."},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"So you have to get your\nservers set up, obviously."},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"Those might be in\nyour own data center."},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"Those might be hosted by a provider."},"504":{"dur":3,"text":"someone needs to set those servers\nup, get them up and running."},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"You need to think about your\navailability requirements,"},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"you need to think about\nyour service batch,"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"you need to think about\nyour server licensing."},"514":{"dur":1,"text":"So all the baseline\nstuff to get your,"},"516":{"dur":1,"text":"just your servers up and running."},"519":{"dur":3,"text":"Then you need some way to\nconnect those PSTN phone numbers"},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"into your server environments."},"525":{"dur":3,"text":"So sometimes,\nyou can terminate PSTN connections,"},"529":{"dur":4,"text":"carrier connections,\ndirect to Skype Business servers."},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"But more often than not,\nif you're scaling, and"},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"typically with PSTN Conferencing,"},"537":{"dur":4,"text":"you're scaling, you probably put a\nsession border controller in place."},"541":{"dur":4,"text":"And that is a physical or virtual\ndevice that sits between your"},"546":{"dur":4,"text":"servers and your carrier,\nyour phone number provider,"},"550":{"dur":3,"text":"provides a security layer,\nprovides some routing abilities."},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"So you put one or\ntwo of those in for your resilience."},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"Next you need to bring a carrier."},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"So you go out to the market, you\nlook at your local carrier whichever"},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"it is and you say look, we want\nto do some conferencing, maybe"},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"want to do some enterprise voice as\nwell, but we want telephone numbers."},"571":{"dur":3,"text":"And your carrier will be able to\ngive you either an old school ISDN"},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"connection, or much more likely\nthese days, a SIT connection,"},"579":{"dur":3,"text":"a connection over IP, that will\ngo between that provider and"},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"the gateway or\nsession border controller and"},"585":{"dur":4,"text":"that's how your phone calls get\nfrom your provider to your server."},"590":{"dur":4,"text":"When you're looking at the carriers,\nit's important to understand what"},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"numbers they'll be\nable to provide you."},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"Carriers can't necessarily\nprovide Numbers for"},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"everywhere in the world for\nyour service."},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"Some are more flexible than others,\nsome are bigger than others."},"607":{"dur":4,"text":"Some of them have different\ninterpretations of regulations, and"},"611":{"dur":3,"text":"also the country you're in will\naffect your regulations as well."},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"And the main crux of\nthe regulation thing is,"},"618":{"dur":3,"text":"is your carrier allowed to give you\na number for a location where you"},"622":{"dur":5,"text":"don't have a billing address,\nan office, a server, a person?"},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"The interpretations\nvary a little bit."},"630":{"dur":3,"text":"But generally speaking, with the SIP\nproviders, you can find them, and"},"634":{"dur":4,"text":"they'll get you up to kind\nof 35 common countries, 40,"},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"it kinda tops out\n40 to 50 countries."},"641":{"dur":3,"text":"Where they'll be able to\ngive you into your service,"},"645":{"dur":4,"text":"dialing numbers for those countries."},"649":{"dur":4,"text":"Sometimes, they won't charge you any\nextra for those lines, sometimes,"},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"because of their costs of bringing\nnumbers in from wherever the world,"},"657":{"dur":3,"text":"they will charge you\nan additional right for"},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"people calling in on those numbers."},"662":{"dur":3,"text":"So the people calling in,\nwe usually pay charge and"},"665":{"dur":3,"text":"your carrier may leverage the charge\nagainst you for their privilege of"},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"bringing in a number that's not in\nyour country or in your region."},"674":{"dur":4,"text":"Some of them as well, and this seems\nto be more common in Europe than"},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"the US, or\nmaybe you tell me different, but"},"681":{"dur":3,"text":"some of them will charge you\na different rental fee for"},"685":{"dur":4,"text":"a conferencing line rather than\na regular PSTN user line as well."},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"They're sort of doing\nthe same thing,"},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"but the logic apparently is that\na conferencing line is more heavily"},"694":{"dur":3,"text":"utilized, so therefore there's\nmore dedicated infrastructure and"},"697":{"dur":1,"text":"more bandwidth, et cetera."},"700":{"dur":4,"text":"Once you've got all that in place,\ndo set up users and away you go."},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"So, a decent amount of work there,\nand"},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"you may already be\nsomewhere down that path."},"709":{"dur":3,"text":"You might have your services up and\njust need your gateway and carrier."},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"You might have your gateway and\ncarrier enterprise voice, and"},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"you just need to go to your\ncarrier and get some more numbers."},"717":{"dur":3,"text":"But if you look at that process\nend to end, decent amount of work,"},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"particularly getting circuits in\nfrom a carrier to your service"},"724":{"dur":1,"text":"to get this set up."},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"So you're doing well top to bottom"},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"to be measuring that\nin weeks not months."},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"And in the carrier circuits,\nusually it's months."},"735":{"dur":5,"text":"So conversely let's look at\nSkype's Business Online, new World."},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"Two bullet points, or\ntwo major bullet points."},"744":{"dur":4,"text":"Additions and options there,\nbasically, you buy it and"},"749":{"dur":1,"text":"you setup your users."},"751":{"dur":1,"text":"And you're not dealing\nwith carriers,"},"753":{"dur":1,"text":"you're not dealing with gateways."},"754":{"dur":3,"text":"You're obviously not dealing servers\nbecause it's all Microsoft service."},"757":{"dur":3,"text":"So top to bottom a bit\neasier to get deployed."},"762":{"dur":1,"text":"Digging in a little bit,\nspecifically for"},"764":{"dur":3,"text":"Skype for Business Online,\nyou have two major options for"},"768":{"dur":2,"text":"PSTN Conferencing numbers."},"770":{"dur":4,"text":"The first one is you\ncan go to Microsoft and"},"775":{"dur":4,"text":"part of your Office 365 service,\nyou can buy your numbers from them."},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"The second is an option"},"782":{"dur":3,"text":"called Audio Conferencing\nservice Providers, ACPs."},"786":{"dur":4,"text":"But those are third parties who are\ncertified with Microsoft to bring"},"790":{"dur":3,"text":"their conferencing\nservice into Office 365."},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"So depending on which\nway you want to go,"},"796":{"dur":4,"text":"commercially who your carrier is\nyou do have two options there."},"800":{"dur":2,"text":"We're mainly gonna look at\nthe Microsoft option today but"},"803":{"dur":2,"text":"there is a list of Audio\nConferencing Providers we'll go"},"805":{"dur":2,"text":"through if you just wanna\nlook at the ACP option."},"811":{"dur":3,"text":"The setup, the users,\nwe'll show that in the demo but"},"815":{"dur":5,"text":"either PowerShell,\nMicrosoft obviously or the portal."},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"And PowerShell,\nI'm a big PowerShell fan,"},"823":{"dur":3,"text":"PowerShell's really where\nthe power of this is."},"826":{"dur":3,"text":"Because end to end we can have\nuser set up very, very quickly."},"833":{"dur":4,"text":"So let's dig into\nMicrosoft PSTN Conferencing."},"838":{"dur":4,"text":"Slightly tricky marketing name\nbecause it's just PSTN Conferencing."},"842":{"dur":2,"text":"But when we say\nMicrosoft PSTN Conferencing,"},"844":{"dur":2,"text":"we're talking about the service\nyou can buy from Microsoft."},"848":{"dur":3,"text":"So, it is direct from Microsoft,\nMicrosoft Audio Service Provider,"},"852":{"dur":3,"text":"they're not reselling a partner,\nyour agreement is with them."},"856":{"dur":3,"text":"It's built as part of your service,\nso"},"859":{"dur":5,"text":"if you go Office 365 E5, it's\nincluded in that bundle of services,"},"865":{"dur":2,"text":"for that top tier\nOffice 365 offering."},"867":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're looking at multiple\nOffice 365 services,"},"870":{"dur":3,"text":"then that can start to make a lot\nof sense commercially cuz you get"},"873":{"dur":1,"text":"a lot of value with\ngoing with a bundle."},"876":{"dur":2,"text":"But you can also buy it\nas an add-on service,"},"878":{"dur":2,"text":"to an existing Skype license,\nor any three license."},"881":{"dur":1,"text":"So you don't have\nto go out very far,"},"883":{"dur":2,"text":"you can buy it as\nan add-on license as well."},"887":{"dur":4,"text":"There's a few things to understand\nabout where you can buy,"},"892":{"dur":1,"text":"and what you get."},"893":{"dur":1,"text":"So, due to carrier regulations,"},"895":{"dur":4,"text":"Microsoft can only sell this\nservice in certain countries."},"900":{"dur":5,"text":"At the moment, it's available\nto be purchased in 64 countries."},"905":{"dur":1,"text":"We'll show a list in a second, and"},"907":{"dur":4,"text":"that country is defined by your\nOffice 365 billing address."},"911":{"dur":2,"text":"So interestingly, not your\ntenant physical location, but"},"914":{"dur":1,"text":"your actual billing address."},"916":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you're looking into this, one\nof the early things you need to do"},"919":{"dur":2,"text":"is understand where your\nOffice 365 service is billed"},"922":{"dur":3,"text":"from because that will influence\nwhether you can purchase it or not."},"925":{"dur":2,"text":"That number is going up all the time\nas the regulations get ticked off"},"928":{"dur":0,"text":"with the legal team."},"929":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you're not on that list,"},"932":{"dur":2,"text":"then start to consider a permanent\nblocker but just be aware."},"936":{"dur":3,"text":"The next concept we have\nis dialing numbers."},"940":{"dur":2,"text":"So these are the numbers\nthat turn up on the invite"},"943":{"dur":1,"text":"on the foreign more numbers."},"944":{"dur":4,"text":"These are the numbers available to\nusers to dial into the conference."},"948":{"dur":3,"text":"And at the moment Microsoft have\ncoverage for 90 countries and"},"952":{"dur":1,"text":"around 400 cities."},"954":{"dur":4,"text":"A city's number is important because\nsometimes you want to have not"},"959":{"dur":3,"text":"just a UK number but a regional\nnumber for the person's dial in."},"963":{"dur":4,"text":"Particularly more in the states\nwhere calling cross state can"},"967":{"dur":2,"text":"sometimes cost more money\nthan in state or in city."},"970":{"dur":3,"text":"Or you just want to hit major cities\nfor the visibility of your service,"},"974":{"dur":0,"text":"that's where your users are."},"977":{"dur":3,"text":"Then the last element is where\nyou can dial out to, and"},"981":{"dur":5,"text":"that's actually 190 countries, give\nor take on the Microsoft service."},"986":{"dur":4,"text":"So, Microsoft give you numbers to\ndial in for 90, but if you are in"},"991":{"dur":4,"text":"a conference and you want to drag\nsomebody in on a phone number,"},"995":{"dur":2,"text":"use that 190 country figure."},"999":{"dur":5,"text":"And we'll dig into\nthe commercials in a second,"},"1005":{"dur":4,"text":"but 45 give or take of those\ncountries, domestic dial outs from"},"1009":{"dur":6,"text":"the conferencing service is no\nadditional charge per minute."},"1016":{"dur":4,"text":"So Microsoft won't charge you for\nthe privilege of them dialing you."},"1020":{"dur":3,"text":"The rest of those countries\nare on a modal pay as you go."},"1024":{"dur":4,"text":"Where you will incurs a permanent\ncharge on your service for"},"1029":{"dur":1,"text":"having Microsoft dial to you."},"1032":{"dur":2,"text":"So, no per minute\ncost on the way in,"},"1034":{"dur":1,"text":"if you pick up the phone and dial."},"1036":{"dur":3,"text":"But if you're one of those\npay-as-you-go countries, and"},"1040":{"dur":3,"text":"you want to dial somebody\ninto the conference,"},"1043":{"dur":2,"text":"there will be a permanent\ncharge levied."},"1048":{"dur":3,"text":"So here's a look at\nthe purchase countries."},"1051":{"dur":4,"text":"Pretty good coverage, don't have\nto scribble all this stuff down."},"1056":{"dur":2,"text":"Obviously there will be\nslides available at the end."},"1058":{"dur":4,"text":"There's a link on this stack and\nthat's the link to the tech"},"1063":{"dur":4,"text":"net article Office 365 article for\nwhich country covered."},"1068":{"dur":4,"text":"That is accurate as of today but\nas I said the service is growing"},"1072":{"dur":1,"text":"all the time so\nit's worth checking back and"},"1074":{"dur":2,"text":"that changes from time to time and\nincreases."},"1076":{"dur":4,"text":"So, 64 countries you
