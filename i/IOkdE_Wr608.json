good idea, that you\ncould come along and show us"},"48":{"dur":3,"text":"how to use some heuristics\nand some simple math tricks"},"51":{"dur":2,"text":"that we could all apply, and\nwe did apply them all very"},"53":{"dur":2,"text":"well in the end, I think,\nto make sure that where"},"55":{"dur":2,"text":"getting the most for our money."},"58":{"dur":1,"text":"CHARLOTTE WEBB:\nOK, well, I thought"},"59":{"dur":2,"text":"I'd bring in some food,\nbecause, you know,"},"62":{"dur":0,"text":"who doesn't like food."},"63":{"dur":1,"text":"INTERVIEWER: Oh yes."},"64":{"dur":4,"text":"CHARLOTTE WEBB: So it's\nkind of obvious to have"},"69":{"dur":1,"text":"a look at prices when\nyou're buying things"},"71":{"dur":1,"text":"at the

course."},"77":{"dur":4,"text":"Sometimes we can be a\nbit confused by prices"},"81":{"dur":2,"text":"when you have different\nsized packages"},"83":{"dur":1,"text":"and whether you're\ngetting the best deal."},"85":{"dur":2,"text":"So this one is kind\nof a basic example."},"87":{"dur":2,"text":"We've got here one\nkilogramme of porridge"},"90":{"dur":1,"text":"and we've got 500 grammes."},"92":{"dur":3,"text":"So hopefully most of you would\nrecognise that this is twice"},"95":{"dur":3,"text":"as large, and so you're\nlooking at doubling the price."},"98":{"dur":0,"text":"INTERVIEWER: Yes."},"99":{"dur":1,"text":"CHARLOTTE WEBB: So\nin this case, as you"},"101":{"dur":3,"text":"might expect, buying the\nbulk is better value for you."},"104":{"dur":1,"text":"So we can see that\nit's 99p here,"},"106":{"dur":3,"text":"and if we bought two of\nthese, we'd have 1 pound 30."},"109":{"dur":1,"text":"INTERVIEWER: Now\nwe've got some widgets"},"111":{"dur":1,"text":"that are on the screen for you."},"112":{"dur":1,"text":"And these are interactive\ntools that you'll"},"114":{"dur":2,"text":"see if you're in the\nWatch and

all you do"},"132":{"dur":2,"text":"is you click on the widget,\nselect the option that"},"134":{"dur":1,"text":"applies to you, and\nthen you close it,"},"136":{"dur":2,"text":"and then you'll be able to\nsee what everybody else has"},"138":{"dur":1,"text":"said as well."},"140":{"dur":2,"text":"CHARLOTTE WEBB: OK, so I thought\nI'd bring another example where"},"143":{"dur":1,"text":"it's not so obvious\nSo here we've"},"144":{"dur":3,"text":"got two packets\nof hot chocolate."},"147":{"dur":2,"text":"The same brand, different\nsized packaging."},"150":{"dur":4,"text":"This one is 154 grammes and\nthis one is 220 grammes."},"154":{"dur":1,"text":"So if you're looking,\nat first glance,"},"155":{"dur":2,"text":"it's not like the porridge,\nit's not sort of obvious."},"157":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not twice as much."},"159":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's kind of hard to\ntell which is better value."},"162":{"dur":2,"text":"So what I would\nrecommend in this case"},"165":{"dur":1,"text":"is look at a unit value."},"166":{"dur":0,"text":"INTERVIEWER: OK."},"167":{"dur":1,"text":"CHARLOTTE WEBB:\nSo that can either"},"168":{"dur":3,"text":"be one gramme in each\npackage or it could"},"172":{"dur":2,"text":"be 100 grammes or whatever."},"175":{"dur":3,"text":"So in this case I'm going\nto have a look at how much"},"178":{"dur":1,"text":"this packet would\nbe for 100 grammes,"},"180":{"dur":2,"text":"and how much this packet\nwould be for 100 grammes."},"182":{"dur":1,"text":"INTERVIEWER: So you're getting a\nbase level so that you can then"},"184":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is something that\nI guess you would be doing"},"187":{"dur":2,"text":"in math, isn't it, to convert\nthings to a level that you can"},"189":{"dur":1,"text":"actually analyse like for like?"},"191":{"dur":2,"text":"CHARLOTTE WEBB: Yeah, so it's\nbasically looking at ratios."},"193":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's looking at what is\nthe ratio of price to grammes."},"198":{"dur":4,"text":"And we're going to use a\ncommon value of 100 grammes."},"203":{"dur":2,"text":"So for example,\nfor this one, if I"},"205":{"dur":3,"text":"want to turn 154 grammes\ninto 100 grammes,"},"208":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going to divide by 1.54."},"210":{"dur":0,"text":"INTERVIEWER: OK."},"211":{"dur":4,"text":"CHARLOTTE WEBB: So if I divide\nmy 2 pounds 79 by 1.54, then"},"215":{"dur":0,"text":"I get--"},"216":{"dur":0,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"217":{"dur":0,"text":"CHARLOTTE WEBB: Yeah."},"218":{"dur":1,"text":"This one I did\nearlier so I didn't"},"219":{"dur":2,"text":"have to remember it or\ncalculate on the spot."},"222":{"dur":2,"text":"So I've got 1.81 for\nthat one for 100 grammes."},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"CHARLOTTE WEBB: And for the\nother packet, same thing."},"226":{"dur":3,"text":"If I want to turn\n220 grammes into 100,"},"230":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to divide by 2.2."},"231":{"dur":0,"text":"INTERVIEWER: Yeah."},"232":{"dur":0,"text":"CHARLOTTE WEBB: And\nagain, I'm going"},"233":{"dur":1,"text":"to get my price per 100 grammes."},"234":{"dur":0,"text":"INTERVIEWER: OK."},"235":{"dur":2,"text":"CHARLOTTE WEBB: And now\nI can see quite clearly"},"237":{"dur":1,"text":"which one is better value."},"238":{"dur":0,"text":"INTERVIEWER: OK"},"239":{"dur":1,"text":"CHARLOTTE WEBB: So\nbasically the idea"},"241":{"dur":2,"text":"is that you're comparing\nlike for like, as you said."},"243":{"dur":4,"text":"So it might be 100 grammes,\nit might be 10 oranges,"},"248":{"dur":2,"text":"it might be a\nsix-pack of drinks,"},"250":{"dur":2,"text":"but you want to\ncompare the same volume"},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"or amount of each product and\nsee which is the best value."},"255":{"dur":1,"text":"INTERVIEWER: So this\nis a basic explanation"},"257":{"dur":1,"text":"of why ratio matters."},"258":{"dur":1,"text":"So student studying\nmathematics might"},"260":{"dur":1,"text":"come across that as\na sort of subject"},"262":{"dur":1,"text":"and think oh, what's\nthat all about,"},"263":{"dur":1,"text":"and this is why it matters."},"264":{"dur":2,"text":"Now the supermarkets are\noften using these equations,"},"267":{"dur":1,"text":"aren't they, on\nlabels and packaging."},"269":{"dur":2,"text":"Do many people know about that?"},"271":{"dur":3,"text":"CHARLOTTE WEBB: I think more\npeople are getting aware of it."},"274":{"dur":2,"text":"A lot of the time, you\ndo have the-- well,"},"276":{"dur":3,"text":"they are required to give the\nunit price in some description"},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"underneath, but it's\nusually very small,"},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"and sometimes tags get\nmoved around and things"},"284":{"dur":2,"text":"in the supermarket, they're\nare always easy to find,"},"286":{"dur":1,"text":"and sometimes when\nthere's offers on,"},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"which is quite frequent,\nthey don't actually"},"291":{"dur":1,"text":"change the unit price."},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"So it is worth just\nknowing how to do it."},"294":{"dur":1,"text":"INTERVIEWER: Absolutely."},"295":{"dur":1,"text":"CHARLOTTE WEBB: And if\nyou've got your phone on you"},"296":{"dur":2,"text":"and you can do a\nquick calculation,"},"298":{"dur":2,"text":"then, just takes\nno time and makes"},"301":{"dur":1,"text":"sure you get the best deals."},"302":{"dur":0,"text":"INTERVIEWER: Perfect."},"303":{"dur":1,"text":"Lovely, I like it."},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"CHARLOTTE WEBB: I thought,\nbefore we show you the widget"},"307":{"dur":4,"text":"question, I've got another\nexample, which is very similar."},"312":{"dur":3,"text":"But this time looking at\nthree different sizes."},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is going to be very\nsimilar to what the widget"},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"question is going to be about."},"320":{"dur":5,"text":"So we've got here one litre,\n2.5 litres, and five litres."},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"So again, I'm going to\nuse the same principle"},"328":{"dur":1,"text":"as with the hot\nchocolate and I'm"},"329":{"dur":4,"text":"going to find out the price\nfor one litre for each packet"},"333":{"dur":2,"text":"or tub of paint."},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"So the first one is already\nin one litre, so great,"},"338":{"dur":1,"text":"don't have to do anything."},"339":{"dur":1,"text":"It's that one."},"341":{"dur":5,"text":"The second one I'm going to\ndivide 15 pounds 80 by 2.5."},"346":{"dur":5,"text":"And the third one I'm going\nto divide 26.5 by five."},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"Now I've calculated\nthese exactly,"},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"but one thing I would say\nis when you're out and about"},"357":{"dur":1,"text":"and you don't have\nyour phone on you,"},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"you can use estimation and\ntry and get a rough idea."},"363":{"dur":4,"text":"So you can think about rounding\nthis up to 16 or even 15,"},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"if it's easier to divide by\nthe number that you've got."},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"So estimation can be\na really useful way"},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"to work things out quickly\nand get a rough idea."},"375":{"dur":0,"text":"INTERVIEWER: Yeah."},"376":{"dur":2,"text":"CHARLOTTE WEBB: But if we\ndid have a calculator handy,"},"378":{"dur":3,"text":"then we could calculate\nthe price per litre,"},"382":{"dur":4,"text":"and we can see that as you might\nexpect, the more you're buying,"},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"the cheaper it's going to be."},"389":{"dur":3,"text":"So with that in mind,\nI'm going to pop up"},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"the widget question, which\nis similar kind of idea,"},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"so hopefully students can\nuse the same principle."},"399":{"dur":1,"text":"INTERVIEWER: So the\nquestion is which"},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"package is the best\nvalue for money,"},"402":{"dur":4,"text":"and your choices are A,\nwhich is this one, B, and C."},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"CHARLOTTE WEBB: Yeah."},"410":{"dur":1,"text":"INTERVIEWER: Sophie\nand HJ, how are"},"411":{"dur":1,"text":"people enjoying the session?"},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"I know, Sophie,\nyou're a math student,"},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"so you are, needless to say,\nfinding this very interesting,"},"417":{"dur":2,"text":"and also you're a keen shopper."},"419":{"dur":1,"text":"SOPHIE: Yes, so it works\nfor me in every way,"},"421":{"dur":3,"text":"and I do actually do this\nwhen I food shop all the time,"},"424":{"dur":3,"text":"so any excuse to do a\nbit of number crunching"},"428":{"dur":3,"text":"and to make it worth\nmy while is great."},"431":{"dur":3,"text":"Stewart did ask if I use it\nto be a better bargain hunter."},"435":{"dur":3,"text":"I think I use it to\njustify buying things."},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"How many wears will\nI get out of this?"},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"How much is it per wear, yeah."},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"INTERVIEWER: Should I buy\nmore, it's much better value."},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"446":{"dur":3,"text":"SOPHIE: Yes, so I definitely do."},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"We have actually have some\nselfies and things in, as well,"},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"and some study buddies\nthat we keep putting off."},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"So please, if you've\ngot any pictures,"},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"your study buddies, you study\nspaces, please send them in."},"460":{"dur":4,"text":"So you've got Milou\nhere from yesterday."},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"He was from, I\nthink [INAUDIBLE]?"},"466":{"dur":0,"text":"HJ: Yes."},"467":{"dur":1,"text":"SOPHIE: Sent that through."},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's her little dog."},"470":{"dur":3,"text":"HJ: We were told to tell\nDave that it is Milou,"},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"'cause we talked about\nTintin, didn't wee-"},"475":{"dur":0,"text":"SOPHIE: And Snowy."},"476":{"dur":3,"text":"HJ: --and Snowy, and it's the\noriginal French translation."},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"So Stweart, I know\nyou're watching,"},"481":{"dur":3,"text":"so if you can calculate those\ntwo points back for that one,"},"484":{"dur":1,"text":"just to give us a\ngood final score."},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"SOPHIE: I won fair and\nsquare in that [INAUDIBLE]."},"488":{"dur":1,"text":"I was very proud of my score."},"490":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm not having Team\nHome take this from me."},"494":{"dur":3,"text":"So we've also got\nPhil's study space here,"},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"which looks very [INAUDIBLE]."},"499":{"dur":0,"text":"INTERVIEWER: That's very nice."},"500":{"dur":0,"text":"I'm quite jealous."},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"I think I might\nhave to up my game."},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"And we've got Noelle here,\nwho joined us yesterday."},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"I haven't seen her on just\nyet, but hopefully we'll"},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"see her a bit later on."},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"Just a couple more."},"512":{"dur":3,"text":"We got another study\nbuddy, which is super cute."},"515":{"dur":1,"text":"This is Melissa's\nstudy buddy called"},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"Amber with little glasses\non, and she's just adorable."},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"I love that."},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"So please feel free to\nsend all of your selfies"},"524":{"dur":3,"text":"at studenthub@open.ac.uk."},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"INTERVIEWER: And what will\nyou send back, Sophie?"},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"SOPHIE: Loads of things."},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"HJ: We've got loads of really\ncool things that we picked out."},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you remember to send\nyour address as well, because,"},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"of course, it's only fair."},"537":{"dur":1,"text":"SOPHIE: We you need\nyour address, though,"},"538":{"dur":1,"text":"so please do send that through."},"540":{"dur":4,"text":"HJ: We've got really cool\nposters and cards and stuff"},"544":{"dur":3,"text":"from the BBC TV\nseries that they do."},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"SOPHIE: We might have\nsome calendars left"},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"as well, which we haven't got\nto show you at the moment,"},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm afraid, but we do have\nsome study planners which"},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"would be nice to send\nover to you as well."},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"So send through to our email\nalong with your address,"},"559":{"dur":1,"text":"and we'll try and get\nthose through to you."},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"HJ: And just as a final point."},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"Stewart's been doing\nthe math and Team Home"},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"are on 1,542 points."},"567":{"dur":0,"text":"So--"},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"SOPHIE: I refuse to\nbelieve that, I'm afraid."},"570":{"dur":4,"text":"As a mathematician, I\nwould say that is wrong."},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"In other words, they still won."},"577":{"dur":1,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you for that, Stewart."},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"You can be our official\nscorekeeper next time."},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"OK, Charlotte."},"584":{"dur":0,"text":"So."},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"We're going to then see what\npeople have said in terms"},"587":{"dur":0,"text":"of best packet of value."},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"Would you like to\nknow people have said?"},"589":{"dur":0,"text":"CHARLOTTE WEBB: Yes, please."},"590":{"dur":1,"text":"INTERVIEWER: OK, let's\nsee what the widget says."},"591":{"dur":1,"text":"So I hope people voted on this."},"593":{"dur":3,"text":"The answer that everyone\nis saying at home is 67%."},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"Are they right?"},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"67%, sorry, have\ngiven the answer of C."},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"CHARLOTTE WEBB: Of\nC. So, well, in my--"},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"let's have a look at the\nanswers and we'll see."},"607":{"dur":3,"text":"So we've got here 500\ngrammes at 3 pounds 15,"},"610":{"dur":3,"text":"we've got 375 grammes 2\npounds 85, and 250 grammes"},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"for 2 pounds and 5 pence."},"617":{"dur":4,"text":"So if we have a look,\nI think maybe the A, B,"},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"and Cs might have been the\nwrong way around, perhaps,"},"623":{"dur":0,"text":"for the students."},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"INTERVIEWER: Oh, maybe, OK."},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"CHARLOTTE WEBB: The large\npacket was 3 pounds 15."},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"INTERVIEWER: Stewart will\nprobably contest this anyway."},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"CHARLOTTE WEBB: We're looking\nat it terms of 100 grammes,"},"633":{"dur":4,"text":"so if we divide the 3 pounds\n15 by 5 then we get 63p."},"637":{"dur":6,"text":"If we've got the 2 pounds 85\ndivided by 3.75, we get 76p,"},"644":{"dur":4,"text":"and 2 pounds 5 pence\ndivided by 2.5 is 82p."},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"So the large package\nis the best value."},"651":{"dur":1,"text":"INTERVIEWER: As\nis often the case."},"652":{"dur":1,"text":"Buying in bulk sort\nof has some rewards"},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"in terms of the packaging,\nI suppose you could say."},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"Sophie, did people have those\nround the wrong way at home?"},"659":{"dur":3,"text":"Are they correct\nin all fairness?"},"662":{"dur":0,"text":"SOPHIE: I don't know."},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"INTERVIEWER: You've been too\nbusy talking about that quiz."},"666":{"dur":0,"text":"Now pay attention."},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"SOPHIE: Stewart's called me\na math geek and a sore loser,"},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"so I'm just trying to think\nof a really good response."},"672":{"dur":0,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"INTERVIEWER: I appreciate\nyou've got lots of things"},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"to do on the hot\ndesk, that's fine."},"677":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's do some more\nmath, Charlotte."},"679":{"dur":1,"text":"CHARLOTTE WEBB: Well,\nbefore we move, on just"},"680":{"dur":1,"text":"to say that obviously\nit is better value,"},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"generally, to buy a bigger\npacket, although not always."},"684":{"dur":0,"text":"You have to check."},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"But it's not better\nvalue if you're"},"686":{"dur":1,"text":"going to let things go\noff in the cupboard."},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"So obviously if you're only\ngoing to use a small pocket,"},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"then it's better to\nbuy the small packet,"},"693":{"dur":3,"text":"because you don't want\nunwanted, wasted food."},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"OK, so a very similar\nquestion here."},"699":{"dur":3,"text":"We've got an eight-pack\nof cola and we've"},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"got a 12-pack of cola."},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is another\nwidget question"},"707":{"dur":3,"text":"for students to have a go at,\nthinking about the unit price."},"711":{"dur":4,"text":"So you might like\nto look at one can,"},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"or you might want to\nlook at-- eight and 12"},"718":{"dur":1,"text":"both have four in\ncommon, so you might like"},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"to look at a pack of\nfour, how much that would"},"723":{"dur":1,"text":"cost if you compare those two."},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"INTERVIEWER: OK, this widget\nis very clearly labelled,"},"727":{"dur":1,"text":"so no excuses this time."},"728":{"dur":3,"text":"So we want to know whether you\nthink the eight or the 12 pack"},"731":{"dur":1,"text":"represents the best\nvalue for money."},"733":{"dur":1,"text":"So you can vote on that\nby selecting the one"},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"that you think is correct."},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"And then you can see where\neveryone else is voting, too."},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"Right, let's see if the\nresults are in for that."},"744":{"dur":1,"text":"Has everyone has a\ngo to look at that."},"746":{"dur":3,"text":"OK, so we've got 67% saying\nthat the 12-pack is the better"},"749":{"dur":0,"text":"value for money there."},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"They're listening to you,\nCharlotte, but are they right?"},"753":{"dur":1,"text":"CHARLOTTE WEBB: Yes, yes."},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"Again, some people\nmay be starting"},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"to get the trend of\nthe larger packets"},"758":{"dur":1,"text":"generally are a better offer."},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not very much\ndifference, I have to say,"},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"so if you only wanted eight,\nI would go for the eight-pack,"},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"because you are only\ngetting two pence cheaper"},"768":{"dur":1,"text":"per can for the 12-pack."},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"So if you are not going\nto get through it,"},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"then it's not so\nmuch of a big saving."},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"So sometimes it's\nactually worth saying,"},"775":{"dur":1,"text":"is it worth it, is\nthe saving actually"},"777":{"dur":1,"text":"something that's going\nto make a difference,"},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"or is it so little that\nit's not worth my while."},"782":{"dur":1,"text":"INTERVIEWER: Math\nand common sense,"},"783":{"dur":1,"text":"isn't it, combined\ntogether, yeah."},"785":{"dur":1,"text":"CHARLOTTE WEBB: Of\ncourse, of course."},"786":{"dur":4,"text":"So definitely think about\nthings like whether you're"},"791":{"dur":3,"text":"Think about things like does\nit matter about the brand?"},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"If you're going to\nbuy the cheaper brand"},"796":{"dur":3,"text":"but actually you don't like it,\nthen it's not really a bargain."},"800":{"dur":1,"text":"If you're buying things\nthat are on offer"},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"but you don't ever use them,\nthen it's not really a bargain."},"804":{"dur":2,"text":"So the

us?"},"811":{"dur":0,"text":"CHARLOTTE WEBB: Yes."},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, the other questions\nI was wanting to find out"},"814":{"dur":2,"text":"was whether students are\nactually going out and looking"},"817":{"dur":3,"text":"for these in the shops,\nor whether they're just"},"820":{"dur":1,"text":"buying things that they like."},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"Are people actually\naware of unit prices?"},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"Are people actually\nlooking for bargains?"},"827":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'd be interested to\nhear from the students."},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"INTERVIEWER: Because we've\ngot a lot of students"},"832":{"dur":2,"text":"here who are at Level 1, and\nthat the majority of students,"},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"when we last checked, was\nstudying science, technology,"},"837":{"dur":1,"text":"engineering, and math."},"839":{"dur":2,"text":"So they may well have\ndifferent views on this,"},"841":{"dur":1,"text":"that students\nstudying other areas"},"842":{"dur":1,"text":"may not be quite as savvy in."},"844":{"dur":1,"text":"So let us know if\nthis is something"},"846":{"dur":1,"text":"that you are currently\ndoing, and also"},"848":{"dur":2,"text":"if you are aware of some\nof these mathematical terms"},"850":{"dur":2,"text":"and concepts and how\nwe're applying them,"},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"because a lot of them\nare a lot more complex"},"854":{"dur":1,"text":"and can be applied\nin other situations,"},"856":{"dur":2,"text":"albeit shopping is a very\nnice, neat example that"},"859":{"dur":1,"text":"does relate to everybody."},"861":{"dur":2,"text":"Sophie and HJ, are you\nchatting about food"},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"or are you chatting about math?"},"865":{"dur":2,"text":"HJ: Well, George\n[INAUDIBLE] saying"},"868":{"dur":3,"text":"that when you buy a big bag\nof crisps it looks too much,"},"872":{"dur":1,"text":"but you open a bag and\nfind it's half full,"},"873":{"dur":1,"text":"and you really needed two bags."},"875":{"dur":6,"text":"And we're also talking\nabout looking at units."},"882":{"dur":1,"text":"It's really hard to\nfind all the comments."},"884":{"dur":1,"text":"If it's going a bit\nquick, like it is for me,"},"886":{"dur":1,"text":"there's a little pin\nbutton to the right where"},"887":{"dur":5,"text":"you can find it, but Angel says\nalways looking at the weights"},"893":{"dur":3,"text":"and trying to do some\nmental arithmetic, which"},"896":{"dur":2,"text":"is not my strong suit,\nbut I'm glad someone there"},"899":{"dur":1,"text":"can manage it."},"903":{"dur":1,"text":"INTERVIEWER: Thank you."},"904":{"dur":2,"text":"Charlotte, these\nsupermarkets are often"},"907":{"dur":3,"text":"finding very clever ways\nof encouraging us to shop,"},"910":{"dur":2,"text":"so buying in bulk with\nhaving larger prices."},"912":{"dur":3,"text":"Having the end of aisles\nand things at eye level"},"915":{"dur":1,"text":"so that they appear\nmore attractive."},"917":{"dur":1,"text":"So there are lots\nof tricks that we"},"918":{"dur":1,"text":"know that supermarkets\nand marketeers are"},"920":{"dur":1,"text":"using to attract our attention."},"922":{"dur":2,"text":"But this idea of buy\none get one free is"},"925":{"dur":1,"text":"quite a common one, isn't it?"},"927":{"dur":2,"text":"And as you say, if you\ngot too much of something,"},"929":{"dur":1,"text":"it's not really a bargain."},"930":{"dur":1,"text":"We asked our\naudience whether they"},"932":{"dur":2,"text":"thought that a BOGO,\nbuy one get one free,"},"935":{"dur":1,"text":"is always a good deal."},"937":{"dur":1,"text":"Now they have been\nvoting on this."},"938":{"dur":1,"text":"Would you like to know\nwhat they think now--"},"940":{"dur":1,"text":"INTERVIEWER: --or\nwould you like to--"},"942":{"dur":3,"text":"So 91% of them have said no."},"946":{"dur":0,"text":"CHARLOTTE WEBB: OK."},"947":{"dur":1,"text":"INTERVIEWER: What are\nyour thoughts on that?"},"949":{"dur":2,"text":"CHARLOTTE WEBB: I would be\ninclined to agree with that."},"952":{"dur":4,"text":"So obviously, if you're paying\na standard price for something"},"956":{"dur":2,"text":"and you do buy lots of\nthem, and the next week it's"},"958":{"dur":2,"text":"at the same price, buy one\nget one free, then great,"},"961":{"dur":1,"text":"that's a good deal."},"963":{"dur":1,"text":"But what does happen\nin a lot of shops"},"964":{"dur":2,"text":"is that the prices\nfluctuate, and the price"},"967":{"dur":2,"text":"might go up a few days\nbefore the buy one get"},"970":{"dur":2,"text":"one free offer\ncomes in, and that's"},"972":{"dur":1,"text":"perfectly legal,\nbecause as long as it's"},"974":{"dur":4,"text":"been on sale for that\nhigher price for 24 hours,"},"978":{"dur":1,"text":"then that's fine."},"980":{"dur":3,"text":"So you do have to be a little\nbit aware of that, just"},"984":{"dur":2,"text":"to make sure how much was\nit before the buy on get"},"986":{"dur":2,"text":"one free deal, and\nis it a good deal."},"988":{"dur":3,"text":"And equally, is it something\nyou actually want lots of,"},"992":{"dur":1,"text":"or are you just buying\nthings, do you end up"},"994":{"dur":2,"text":"with a basket full of things\nthat you don't normally"},"996":{"dur":1,"text":"buy because they're on offer?"},"997":{"dur":2,"text":"INTERVIEWER: Or even a brand\nthat you think, oh, I'm"},"999":{"dur":2,"text":"swayed to buy that brand because\nI'll be getting two of those,"},"1002":{"dur":1,"text":"but it may be more expensive\nthan the one you would"},"1004":{"dur":1,"text":"have normally purchased anyway."},"1005":{"dur":0,"text":"CHARLOTTE WEBB: Yes, exactly."},"1006":{"dur":1,"text":"So there's lots of things\nlike that to look out"},"1008":{"dur":1,"text":"for when you're shopping."},"1009":{"dur":2,"text":"And outside of shopping,\nbecause we talked a lot"},"1011":{"dur":2,"text":"about supermarket shopping,\nthere's lots of other things"},"1014":{"dur":1,"text":"that you should be\nlooking for deals on."},"1015":{"dur":4,"text":"Things like loans, insurance,\nmobile phones, anything"},"1020":{"dur":2,"text":"like that where there's lots\nof competitors out there,"},"1022":{"dur":2,"text":"you want to be looking\nfor a good deal."},"1025":{"dur":2,"text":"So I thought we could have\na look at some mobile phone"},"1028":{"dur":2,"text":"So these are just examples."},"1030":{"dur":4,"text":"I haven't taken these from\nreal companies, but they--"},"1034":{"dur":0,"text":"INTERVIEWER: Made up."},"1035":{"dur":2,"text":"CHARLOTTE WEBB: They\nrepresent the sorts"},"1037":{"dur":1,"text":"of deals you might get."},"1039":{"dur":2,"text":"So let's just\nassume that they're"},"1041":{"dur":2,"text":"all the same price, 25 pounds."},"1044":{"dur":3,"text":"So you're paying the\nsame monthly fees"},"1047":{"dur":1,"text":"for your mobile phone."},"1048":{"dur":3,"text":"And the question is, basically,\nwhich is the best deal?"},"1052":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can see they've all\ngot different incentives."},"1054":{"dur":4,"text":"The first one has got 300 free\ntexts and 300 free minutes,"},"1059":{"dur":5,"text":"second one has got 500 free\ntexts and 200 free minutes,"},"1064":{"dur":5,"text":"and the third one has got 1,000\nfree texts and no free minutes."},"1069":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is a really\nimportant example"},"1071":{"dur":2,"text":"to remember that it depends\non what you actually"},"1074":{"dur":1,"text":"are going to use."},"1075":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you're going to use\n300 free minutes and 300"},"1078":{"dur":2,"text":"free calls, then you're not\ngoing to pay anything extra."},"1080":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's going to be\nthe best deal for you."},"1082":{"dur":1,"text":"And if you don't\nmake any phone calls,"},"1084":{"dur":3,"text":"then company C is going to\nbe the best deal for you."},"1087":{"dur":1,"text":"But I wanted to\nlook at something"},"1089":{"dur":2,"text":"where you'd have to do a\nlittle bit of calculating,"},"1091":{"dur":1,"text":"so we've got here--"},"1092":{"dur":1,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"1093":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah, I would."},"1094":{"dur":4,"text":"We've got here, if you use\n700 texts and 300 minutes,"},"1099":{"dur":1,"text":"which should be the best deal?"},"1101":{"dur":2,"text":"Now for me, looking\nat it straight away,"},"1103":{"dur":1,"text":"it's not obvious."},"1105":{"dur":2,"text":"I can't sort of go, OK,\nthat one's the best deal."},"1107":{"dur":3,"text":"I think I need to start\nhaving a look at what"},"1111":{"dur":1,"text":"it's going to cost me."},"1112":{"dur":2,"text":"INTERVIEWER: Are you going\nto get us to do those unit"},"1114":{"dur":1,"text":"comparisons again?"},"1115":{"dur":2,"text":"CHARLOTTE WEBB: This is not\nquite a unit comparison,"},"1118":{"dur":1,"text":"because-- well, I suppose\nwe're looking at--"},"1120":{"dur":1,"text":"we are looking at\nhow much it costs"},"1121":{"dur":2,"text":"in this deal for 700\ntexts and 300 minutes."},"1123":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's kind of a\nunit deal, yeah."},"1125":{"dur":3,"text":"So if we have a look at\nthe breakdown of what"},"1129":{"dur":1,"text":"we need to calculate."},"1130":{"dur":5,"text":"With the first company, you need\n700 texts and you get 300 free."},"1135":{"dur":3,"text":"So that means you actually have\nto pay for the other 400 texts,"},"1139":{"dur":2,"text":"and they've given a\nrate of 5p per text."},"1142":{"dur":2,"text":"So just some simple\nmultiplication."},"1144":{"dur":5,"text":"So 400 text times 5p, and\nthat gives you 20 pounds."},"1149":{"dur":1,"text":"And then the calls,\nwhile you only need--"},"1151":{"dur":2,"text":"INTERVIEWER: I like the way\nyou kept the units consistent"},"1153":{"dur":2,"text":"throughout the\ncalculation as p's."},"1156":{"dur":2,"text":"CHARLOTTE WEBB:\nYeah, well, it is"},"1158":{"dur":2,"text":"easy to get mixed up sometimes."},"1160":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's just worth remembering\nthat, obviously, when you're"},"1163":{"dur":2,"text":"doing these things, you've got\nto convert back into pounds,"},"1165":{"dur":1,"text":"or you can keep it\nin pence if you like,"},"1167":{"dur":4,"text":"but it's a bit harder to see\nwhat value you're getting."},"1171":{"dur":1,"text":"And then this\nperson doesn't have"},"1173":{"dur":2,"text":"to pay anything extra\nfor phone calls."},"1175":{"dur":3,"text":"So they're just paying\nthat that 20 pounds on top"},"1178":{"dur":1,"text":"of the original 25 pounds."},"1180":{"dur":2,"text":"So that deal's\ncosting 45 pounds."},"1183":{"dur":2,"text":"The second deal, you get\na lot more texts free,"},"1186":{"dur":1,"text":"so you only need to pay for 200."},"1188":{"dur":2,"text":"Same thing, multiply\nby 5 pence, and that's"},"1190":{"dur":2,"text":"going to cost you 10\npounds, and then we"},"1193":{"dur":2,"text":"need to pay for\nsome extra minutes."},"1195":{"dur":2,"text":"So again, they've\ngiven a rate of 15p,"},"1197":{"dur":3,"text":"so that's an extra\n15 pounds on top."},"1201":{"dur":3,"text":"And so you're adding another 25\npounds, which is quite a lot,"},"1204":{"dur":0,"text":"actually."},"1205":{"dur":1,"text":"And if you are\nsometimes-- if you're"},"1207":{"dur":1,"text":"buying a new mobile\nphone and you"},"1208":{"dur":1,"text":"don't know how many\nminutes you're using,"},"1210":{"dur":2,"text":"it's worth having a look\nat your previous bills"},"1212":{"dur":1,"text":"before you start a new contract."},"1214":{"dur":1,"text":"Because if you are\npaying, quite often"},"1216":{"dur":2,"text":"when they have free\nminutes, the extra minutes"},"1218":{"dur":2,"text":"are more than they\nmight have been."},"1221":{"dur":1,"text":"INTERVIEWER: When I\ndo this, I actually"},"1223":{"dur":1,"text":"have asked my mobile\nphone company,"},"1224":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'll say how many do I\nnormally use, and they often"},"1227":{"dur":1,"text":"have a calculation there,\nand they can tell you,"},"1229":{"dur":2,"text":"well it's averaged this, and\nthis was on your last bill."},"1231":{"dur":2,"text":"So they're able to supply\nthat information for you"},"1233":{"dur":1,"text":"if you ask for."},"1235":{"dur":1,"text":"CHARLOTTE WEBB:\nIt's very important,"},"1237":{"dur":2,"text":"because I know that when\nI've gone into phone shops,"},"1239":{"dur":2,"text":"you do get overwhelmed with\nall the different deals"},"1242":{"dur":1,"text":"and what's going on and--"},"1243":{"dur":1,"text":"INTERVIEWER: You think that\nseems like a lot or not a lot."},"1245":{"dur":0,"text":"CHARLOTTE WEBB: Yes."},"1246":{"dur":1,"text":"INTERVIEWER: Difficult\nto quantify, isn't it?"},"1247":{"dur":2,"text":"CHARLOTTE WEBB: And often,\nas this is demonstrating,"},"1249":{"dur":1,"text":"the fee that you're\npaying per month"},"1250":{"dur":1,"text":"isn't actually what\nyou end up paying."},"1252":{"dur":2,"text":"Quite often there's\nextra expenses."},"1255":{"dur":2,"text":"So in the final company,\nyou're getting--"},"1257":{"dur":1,"text":"you don't have to\npay for any texts,"},"1259":{"dur":2,"text":"but you've got 300\ntext, essentially,"},"1261":{"dur":1,"text":"that you're not using."},"1262":{"dur":1,"text":"So it seems a bit of a waste."},"1263":{"dur":2,"text":"And then you don't\nget any free calls,"},"1265":{"dur":4,"text":"so you're having to pay 10p for\neach of those minutes, which"},"1270":{"dur":1,"text":"comes to 30 pounds."},"1271":{"dur":4,"text":"So in this example, company\nA would be the cheapest."},"1275":{"dur":2,"text":"But of course, if you\ndidn't use any minutes,"},"1278":{"dur":1,"text":"company C would be the cheapest."},"1279":{"dur":2,"text":"So it does depend\nperson to person,"},"1281":{"dur":2,"text":"and it is really important\nto have that in mind"},"1284":{"dur":2,"text":"when you're going\nshopping for these things."},"1286":{"dur":0,"text":"INTERVIEWER: Exactly."},"1287":{"dur":1,"text":"OK, and that's a\nreally useful example,"},"1288":{"dur":2,"text":"and as you say, it wasn't\nobvious at the beginning,"},"1290":{"dur":2,"text":"because I thought that B would\nhave been the better one

scheme,\nor things like that."},"1371":{"dur":2,"text":"So you have to got to\nbe careful that deals"},"1373":{"dur":1,"text":"are what they seem\nand there isn't"},"1375":{"dur":2,"text":"any sort of strings attached."},"1378":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's just\nsomething that that"},"1380":{"dur":4,"text":"brought to mind when I\nheard that shoe offer."},"1384":{"dur":0,"text":"INTERVIEWER: Lovely."},"1385":{"dur":2,"text":"Now price comparison\nwebsites strike me as a way"},"1387":{"dur":2,"text":"that you'll often get this sort\nof information, and as you say,"},"1390":{"dur":2,"text":"you can pick at\nthings that are there"},"1392":{"dur":1,"text":"to sort of fit your needs."},"1394":{"dur":1,"text":"So if they are not\nrelevant to

here,"},"1418":{"dur":3,"text":"I saw a poster for kind\nof an affordable loan,"},"1422":{"dur":2,"text":"and it just got me\nthinking about how"},"1424":{"dur":2,"text":"posters and adverts and\neverything kind of influence"},"1427":{"dur":1,"text":"us."},"1428":{"dur":2,"text":"So this affordable loan\nthat was being advertised"},"1430":{"dur":4,"text":"was 400 pounds, and it said pay\nback weekly 10 pounds 19 pence"},"1435":{"dur":1,"text":"for 52 weeks."},"1436":{"dur":1,"text":"And actually, that does\nsound very affordable,"},"1438":{"dur":1,"text":"10 pounds a week."},"1440":{"dur":4,"text":"But a quick calculation, if you\ntimes 10 pounds 19 times 52,"},"1445":{"dur":2,"text":"then that gives\nyou 529 pounds 88."},"1447":{"dur":0,"text":"INTERVIEWER: Right."},"1448":{"dur":1,"text":"CHARLOTTE WEBB: Which\nmeans that you're actually"},"1450":{"dur":7,"text":"paying 129 pounds 88 interest\non 400 pounds, which is 32.5%."},"1457":{"dur":1,"text":"And if you look at a\nstandard loan from a bank,"},"1459":{"dur":3,"text":"I had a quick look on the\ntrain, majority of banks"},"1462":{"dur":1,"text":"are around 3%."},"1464":{"dur":5,"text":"So you're paying 30% for a loan\nwhich you could get for 3%."},"1469":{"dur":3,"text":"And 400 pounds on a\n3% loan for a year"},"1473":{"dur":4,"text":"would be 12 pounds interest,\ncompared to that 129."},"1478":{"dur":2,"text":"And even more shocking\nis the payday loans,"},"1481":{"dur":4,"text":"which, they do have small\nprint which tell you"},"1485":{"dur":1,"text":"that they are for\nshort term basis"},"1487":{"dur":3,"text":"only, so one month,\ntwo months, et cetera."},"1490":{"dur":3,"text":"But I had a quick look\nat one which allows"},"1494":{"dur":2,"text":"you to borrow 400 pounds."},"1496":{"dur":2,"text":"The minimum time you can\npay back is three months."},"1498":{"dur":2,"text":"So you have to at\nleast be charged"},"1500":{"dur":1,"text":"interest for three

of APR\ninterest sinks in,"},"1531":{"dur":3,"text":"which was 1,575% interest."},"1535":{"dur":2,"text":"Now if you're OK\nwith percentages"},"1538":{"dur":3,"text":"and you see that number,\nit
