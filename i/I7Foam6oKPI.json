Excellent."},"263":{"dur":2,"text":"In your podcast, you've\ntalked about the monkey brain."},"266":{"dur":1,"text":"Can you explain what that is?"},"267":{"dur":0,"text":"TIM FERRISS: Yeah."},"268":{"dur":2,"text":"The monkey brain or monkey mind\nis, I think, inside all of us"},"271":{"dur":0,"text":"in some capacity."},"272":{"dur":4,"text":"It's this incessant

head."},"282":{"dur":3,"text":"And we can all think back\nto, say, elementary school."},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"I remember there was\nthis kid in my class."},"288":{"dur":1,"text":"He was always misbehaving."},"289":{"dur":1,"text":"And I remember at\none point, he got up."},"291":{"dur":1,"text":"It was like third grade."},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"And the teacher suddenly froze."},"295":{"dur":0,"text":"And we turned around."},"296":{"dur":2,"text":"And he had a fork over his head."},"298":{"dur":2,"text":"And he said I am the\nmaster of the universe."},"300":{"dur":2,"text":"And he stabbed an\nelectrical outlet"},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"and just got, like,\nblown backwards."},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"And then there was this\nkid who would walk over"},"307":{"dur":3,"text":"and he would always-- he\nwould build a building out"},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"of construction blocks."},"312":{"dur":2,"text":"And then inevitably, it would\nfall over when it got too tall."},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"And then he'd just\nlay down and cry."},"317":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think that\nas we get older,"},"319":{"dur":1,"text":"we learn to not do those\nthings because you'd"},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"be put in a straitjacket."},"323":{"dur":1,"text":"But as a result,\nthey're internalized."},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"So all day, we're walking\naround with some version"},"328":{"dur":1,"text":"or a combination of\nall of those things."},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"And the context in which\nI probably brought it up,"},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"the monkey mind,\nwas as it relates"},"335":{"dur":1,"text":"to my morning journaling."},"337":{"dur":1,"text":"So I do regularly journal."},"339":{"dur":2,"text":"Sometimes I do what would\nbe considered morning pages."},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"Other times, I use something\ncalled the Five Minute Journal,"},"344":{"dur":1,"text":"which we could talk about."},"346":{"dur":4,"text":"But the goal is not\nto write, per se."},"350":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not doing it\nfor someone else."},"352":{"dur":3,"text":"I am simply capturing\nmy monkey mind."},"355":{"dur":4,"text":"It's litany of complaints\nor insecurities on paper"},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"so that it's not caught on\nrepeat for the rest of the day."},"362":{"dur":5,"text":"I'm simply giving it a\ntwo-dimensional prison"},"368":{"dur":4,"text":"or playpen so that I can\nthen move on with my day"},"372":{"dur":4,"text":"and hit mute at least for\na brief period of time"},"376":{"dur":0,"text":"on those things."},"377":{"dur":6,"text":"But I think that if you want\nto be less reactive, to be"},"383":{"dur":3,"text":"the author of your own life\nor business career, whatever"},"387":{"dur":3,"text":"it might be, you have to\nbe able to do deep work"},"390":{"dur":3,"text":"and think long-term\nand rationally."},"393":{"dur":1,"text":"And for all of those\nthings, you need"},"395":{"dur":1,"text":"to get very good at\nidentifying where you're"},"397":{"dur":5,"text":"being overly reactive to\nthoughts, to external factors"},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"outside of your control,\nwhatever it might be."},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"JORDAN THIBODEAU: That ties\nback to the Five Minute Journal."},"407":{"dur":0,"text":"TIM FERRISS: It does."},"408":{"dur":1,"text":"The Five Minute\nJournal is-- it's"},"410":{"dur":1,"text":"a journal that was\ncreated by a reader"},"411":{"dur":1,"text":"of \"The 4-Hour\nWorkweek,\" actually,"},"412":{"dur":1,"text":"for those who have\nread the book."},"414":{"dur":3,"text":"It was their muse--\nso one of their cash"},"417":{"dur":4,"text":"flow-focused businesses in the\ncontext of lifestyle design."},"421":{"dur":3,"text":"But you take 2 and 1\/2\nminutes or so in the morning"},"425":{"dur":1,"text":"and then again at night."},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"And so one is effectively a\nfocusing and planning exercise."},"429":{"dur":1,"text":"There's also a\ngratitude component,"},"430":{"dur":3,"text":"which I think is very\ncritical for those of us who"},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"are driven Type A achievers."},"437":{"dur":3,"text":"It's very easy to constantly\nbe focused on the future"},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"and just to hit\npause for a second."},"442":{"dur":1,"text":"I've heard someone\nsay that depression"},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"is an obsession with\nthe past and anxieties,"},"446":{"dur":1,"text":"and an obsession\nwith the future."},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, if you look\nat achievers, they"},"450":{"dur":1,"text":"tend to be very future-focused."},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"And as soon as they hit\na goal, they're like,"},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"don't have time to\ncelebrate this small win."},"457":{"dur":3,"text":"This isn't good enough-- bigger,\nbigger, better, et cetera."},"460":{"dur":4,"text":"And that is a pattern that can\nbe very self-destructive even"},"465":{"dur":3,"text":"if you rack up a lot of\nwins at the same time."},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"So the gratitude component\nis extremely critical."},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"That takes but 2 and\n1\/2 minutes each day."},"472":{"dur":4,"text":"And it also helps to\nidentify your focal points"},"477":{"dur":4,"text":"or your priorities so that\nwhen inevitably that 10% that's"},"482":{"dur":3,"text":"left of the monkey mind pops\nup to dance in front of you"},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"and distract you\nfrom your objectives"},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"you set out for the day,\nyou can return to that."},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"And then at the end\nof the day, it's"},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"basically a performance review."},"493":{"dur":5,"text":"And I find it incredibly helpful\nand a lot of ROI for the time"},"499":{"dur":0,"text":"invested."},"500":{"dur":1,"text":"JORDAN THIBODEAU: Excellent."},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"So it seems like it gives you\na degree of mental clarity."},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"TIM FERRISS: Yeah, it does."},"505":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think that\nwhat separates--"},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"if I think about\nmy podcast, I've"},"508":{"dur":3,"text":"interviewed 100 to 150\nworld-class performers"},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"across every possible\ndemand imaginable-- sports,"},"514":{"dur":4,"text":"entertainment,\npolitics, art, chess,"},"518":{"dur":3,"text":"it just goes on and on-- that\nthe difference between somebody"},"522":{"dur":3,"text":"who's good,

maintain if you\ncreate the proper environments."},"562":{"dur":6,"text":"And I'm not a huge fan of\nself-control or willpower."},"569":{"dur":1,"text":"I think it's really overrated."},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"It's like, oh, well, fat people\nare fat because they just"},"573":{"dur":0,"text":"lack the willpower."},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"It's like, no."},"575":{"dur":4,"text":"That's a stupid, lazy answer,\nor just a shite observation."},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"If you look at\nbehavior modifications,"},"581":{"dur":0,"text":"they just have\nlack of incentives."},"582":{"dur":1,"text":"They have lack of\nsocial accountability."},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe they don't have the\ninformation that they need."},"587":{"dur":3,"text":"And you can create environments\nin which you can train."},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"And I come back to this over\nand over and over again."},"592":{"dur":5,"text":"But there are few things I\nthink that are very helpful."},"598":{"dur":3,"text":"One is memento\nmori, so remembering"},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"that you're going\nto die, and putting"},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"that-- it's also very stoic."},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm somewhat obsessed about\ndeath, even to a degree"},"609":{"dur":0,"text":"that I find weird."},"610":{"dur":5,"text":"But memento mori-- so\nconstantly revisiting death"},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"and realizing it forces\nyou to put your life"},"618":{"dur":4,"text":"in a broader context of\ncivilization and the world."},"622":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think that in and of\nitself is very corrective."},"626":{"dur":1,"text":"And how do you\npractice or develop"},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"that sense of memento mori?"},"629":{"dur":1,"text":"I have a quote on\nmy refrigerator"},"631":{"dur":1,"text":"that's from Marcus Aurelius."},"632":{"dur":3,"text":"And \"Meditations,\" by the way,\nis effectively a war journal."},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"While Marcus Aurelius, who\nwas the most powerful man"},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"on the planet at the\ntime-- emperor of Rome--"},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"was on a military campaign."},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"And he would write these entries\nto do exactly this-- to remind"},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"himself that he was just a\nman, he was going to die,"},"649":{"dur":0,"text":"it would all be dust."},"650":{"dur":3,"text":"And it sounds depressing\nuntil you realize the clarity"},"653":{"dur":5,"text":"and lack of waste that comes\nfrom constantly repeating"},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"those types of things."},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"Then you have the memento\nhomo-- probably getting"},"663":{"dur":0,"text":"the pronunciation off."},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"But that is remembering that\nyou are just a man or a person."},"668":{"dur":4,"text":"So we don't have-- those in\nthis room probably are not"},"673":{"dur":1,"text":"going to commission,\nlike Julius Caesar,"},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"someone to hold a laurel\nwreath over your head"},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"while you're doing a procession\nlike the Roman triumph"},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"to say you're just a man, you're\njust a man, you're not a god."},"682":{"dur":4,"text":"But the way that you can\nvery easily humble yourself"},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"is to always try to\nbe the weakest

matter."},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"But I always try to be the\nweakest person in the room."},"706":{"dur":5,"text":"And I remember when I was 15,\nI had my first time

was competing in judo."},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"And the high school\nthat I went to"},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"was not particularly\nstrong in judo."},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"But I was the big fish\nin the little pond."},"725":{"dur":1,"text":"And I got very high and mighty."},"727":{"dur":3,"text":"I thought I was\njust the cat's meow."},"730":{"dur":1,"text":"And I wasn't too overt about it."},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"But I was very sort of satisfied\nwith how well I was doing."},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"Went to my first\ntournament and I"},"736":{"dur":3,"text":"got demolished in seven\nseconds by this guy who weighed"},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"40 pounds less than I did."},"741":{"dur":1,"text":"Like Ippon Gachi-- that was it."},"742":{"dur":0,"text":"I was

that they would\nbe able to kind of, like, was"},"759":{"dur":1,"text":"a finger and laugh."},"760":{"dur":1,"text":"And we love Japan."},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"But it's like I get it--\na very homogeneous place."},"764":{"dur":4,"text":"So I ended up going after that\nto a cram school for judo,"},"769":{"dur":2,"text":"like a juku-- they have it for\nall sorts of things-- at night."},"771":{"dur":4,"text":"And I want to Tokai\nUniversity's judo cram schools."},"776":{"dur":2,"text":"So Tokai University produces\ngold medalists in the
