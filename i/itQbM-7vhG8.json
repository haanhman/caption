we're both rhyming on it but the hook\nis like, you know, real singy and stuff."},"659":{"dur":4,"text":"So I was like, yo, let me do the Ike turn\nup version."},"663":{"dur":3,"text":"I came up with the concept of wasted, he said\nthe hook."},"666":{"dur":5,"text":"So, if you wanna call it wasted part two,\nthis is Ike turn ups wasted, it's a

like, it was truly like a therapy session\nfor me."},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"- [Vlad] I mean, why are you singing on it?"},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"That's what I wanna know."},"707":{"dur":3,"text":"- You know what, a couple reasons, one, and\nI always go back."},"711":{"dur":5,"text":"Like, if you even listen to the stuff that\nI was doing in the late '90s, I was singing"},"716":{"dur":3,"text":"and rapping back then, but it wasn't cool\nto do both back then."},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"You had to do one or the other."},"721":{"dur":3,"text":"And I remember, that was even an issue at\nthe label a lot of times."},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"It was like, yo, do you wanna be an R&B singer\nor you wanna be a rapper, you can't be both?"},"727":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, I leaned more towards the rap stuff\nand stopped singing the hooks, and stopped"},"732":{"dur":1,"text":"singing the records and stuff."},"733":{"dur":8,"text":"So, then, gradually, even my pen game, I just\nfound myself doing all of this R&B stuff,"},"741":{"dur":4,"text":"and then, obviously, you know, the company\nthat you keep, being married to Mariah and"},"746":{"dur":3,"text":"being in sessions and all that stuff, I was\nreally in that phase."},"750":{"dur":6,"text":"And then you see these young cats like Bryce\nand then Drake coming out doing both, and"},"756":{"dur":1,"text":"I was like, yo, that's..."},"757":{"dur":2,"text":"I got excited, I was like, yo, they doing\nwhat I've been doing."},"760":{"dur":5,"text":"I was like, I'm so happy that the game has\nembraced cats to just be creative and be artists,"},"765":{"dur":5,"text":"and you don't have to just be a spitter, you\ndon't have to just be an R&B singer, you can"},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"just bring it all together."},"772":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, because I know it's an uphill battle."},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"Cats necessarily, whether it's from Wild N\nOut or because they might have been introduced"},"779":{"dur":4,"text":"to me from Nickelodeon, they don't necessarily\nwanna hear Nick Cannon bars off top."},"783":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I was like, you know what, I'm gonna let\nthem shoot at this, I ain't even gonna come"},"787":{"dur":1,"text":"with no bars."},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm gonna sing this whole thing and show you\nmy talent level on that
