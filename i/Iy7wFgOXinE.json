democracy"},"2927":{"dur":1,"text":"was set into this environment in which"},"2929":{"dur":1,"text":"the Athenians were quite clear"},"2930":{"dur":3,"text":"about what they expected of one another."},"2934":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that prevented the democracy"},"2935":{"dur":2,"text":"from rushing headlong into bigger problems"},"2937":{"dur":3,"text":"sooner than it did, although it rushed pretty quickly."},"2941":{"dur":3,"text":"So, the questions that I mentioned"},"2944":{"dur":2,"text":"the Athenians asked, this vetting process,"},"2947":{"dur":1,"text":"where you had to essentially testify"},"2949":{"dur":2,"text":"to the fact that you took care of your parents, et cetera."},"2952":{"dur":1,"text":"The Athenians didn't kid themselves that"},"2953":{"dur":1,"text":"they could live any way they wanted,"},"2955":{"dur":1,"text":"and have a successful society."},"2957":{"dur":2,"text":"Even Pericles, in that very passage,"},"2959":{"dur":1,"text":"where he says \"We live the way we want,"},"2961":{"dur":2,"text":"\"but we don't break those laws that are shameful to break.\""},"2963":{"dur":1,"text":"Unwritten laws."},"2965":{"dur":1,"text":"So, one of the things that's admirable"},"2967":{"dur":1,"text":"about Athens is it was a society"},"2968":{"dur":2,"text":"that had a basic agreement about their goals."},"2971":{"dur":1,"text":"That's what a society is, the Latin word"},"2972":{"dur":2,"text":"societas is about socii, allies"},"2975":{"dur":3,"text":"who are working towards some end

for?"},"3013":{"dur":2,"text":"So, the Athenians I think were admirable"},"3016":{"dur":3,"text":"in the way they agreed about certain"},"3019":{"dur":2,"text":"goals of their society, and I'll just say"},"3021":{"dur":2,"text":"as homogenous as Athenian society was"},"3024":{"dur":1,"text":"by modern standards, and it was,"},"3026":{"dur":2,"text":"in it they had slaves, they didn't treat women well,"},"3028":{"dur":3,"text":"and did all kinds of bad things that all Greeks did."},"3031":{"dur":2,"text":"They produced an amazing amount of intellectual"},"3033":{"dur":2,"text":"diversity

keep the money in the festival funds,"},"3063":{"dur":2,"text":"or bring it over to spend it on military."},"3066":{"dur":2,"text":"So you also talked about their high"},"3068":{"dur":2,"text":"moral standards, values of religion and such."},"3071":{"dur":2,"text":"Isn't it pretty unsurprising then,"},"3073":{"dur":2,"text":"that they would want to keep the money"},"3075":{"dur":1,"text":"in the festival funds, considering that"},"3077":{"dur":3,"text":"these festivals were entirely religious."},"3081":{"dur":2,"text":"This was after a time that Pericles"},"3083":{"dur":2,"text":"did institute these allotments of money"},"3086":{"dur":2,"text":"for people who were in Athens to go to these festivals,"},"3088":{"dur":2,"text":"who previously couldn't afford it anymore."},"3091":{"dur":2,"text":"It got too expensive, they were leasing out theaters,"},"3093":{"dur":2,"text":"it became necessary, and then these people"},"3095":{"dur":2,"text":"wouldn't have been able to participate"},"3098":{"dur":2,"text":"in these religious festivals if they"},"3100":{"dur":1,"text":"moved it to military funds."},"3102":{"dur":3,"text":"- Yeah, there's a lot in that question."},"3105":{"dur":1,"text":"If I left the impression that the Athenians"},"3106":{"dur":4,"text":"had high moral standards, I think that was unfortunate."},"3111":{"dur":1,"text":"I would say high social standards."},"3113":{"dur":0,"text":"I think their moral standards were"},"3114":{"dur":2,"text":"high by their own estimation, but they might"},"3116":{"dur":1,"text":"not have been by

had high standards by"},"3132":{"dur":2,"text":"their own definition of morals."},"3135":{"dur":3,"text":"And also religion was not a moral issue for the Athenians."},"3138":{"dur":2,"text":"It had really nothing whatsoever to do with morals."},"3141":{"dur":0,"text":"This is hard for us to understand"},"3142":{"dur":1,"text":"brought up in the Western tradition"},"3143":{"dur":2,"text":"where morality and religion go hand in hand,"},"3146":{"dur":1,"text":"but the ancient Greeks saw philosophy"},"3147":{"dur":1,"text":"as the place where you learned"},"3149":{"dur":2,"text":"about morality, not in religion."},"3152":{"dur":2,"text":"So, what I would say is that it's not"},"3155":{"dur":1,"text":"that surprising that the Athenians"},"3156":{"dur":1,"text":"kept that money in the festival fund"},"3158":{"dur":2,"text":"instead of moving it in the military fund"},"3160":{"dur":2,"text":"because they had leaders telling them"},"3162":{"dur":2,"text":"\"You don't need to worry

you"},"3259":{"dur":1,"text":"suggest that somebody go about starting that."},"3261":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yes, we're starting it now, and let's all (laughs)"},"3264":{"dur":2,"text":"I hope I can have your support, no."},"3267":{"dur":2,"text":"I told this story earlier that"},"3269":{"dur":3,"text":"when I wrote What's Wrong With Democracy,"},"3272":{"dur":2,"text":"I started to write an

sometimes,"},"3286":{"dur":1,"text":"and you realize that the paper"},"3287":{"dur":1,"text":"is really about something else"},"3288":{"dur":1,"text":"than you thought you had written,"},"3290":{"dur":2,"text":"and you go oh man, my thesis is really this."},"3292":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah, but that's when I realized"},"3294":{"dur":3,"text":"that I had fallen into my own trap, the democracy trap,"},"3298":{"dur":2,"text":"which is that we can fix this by"},"3300":{"dur":2,"text":"tweaking the Constitution, or voting better,"},"3302":{"dur":1,"text":"or making this little structural change,"},"3304":{"dur":2,"text":"or this little structural change."},"3307":{"dur":3,"text":"I do not want to leave the impression that I believe that."},"3311":{"dur":1,"text":"I absolutely don't believe it."},"3312":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes, I think there's some changes"},"3313":{"dur":1,"text":"that would be nice in the short term,"},"3315":{"dur":1,"text":"they would make

citizenship."},"3335":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think that whether you have"},"3338":{"dur":2,"text":"a limited monarchy, a constitutional monarchy,"},"3340":{"dur":4,"text":"whether you have some kind of citizenship"},"3345":{"dur":1,"text":"or voting rights based on some kind of"},"3347":{"dur":2,"text":"duties that people have to perform, I would be all for that."},"3350":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that's a great idea."},"3351":{"dur":0,"text":"But it would still be the character"},"3352":{"dur":3,"text":"of the citizens that make the state good or not."},"3355":{"dur":2,"text":"It wouldn't be that form of government."},"3358":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's really about us, and not about"},"3360":{"dur":1,"text":"the form of government."},"3362":{"dur":1,"text":"It's perfectly reasonable

that"},"3386":{"dur":2,"text":"poor people, as hard as this is to believe,"},"3388":{"dur":1,"text":"tend to look up to rich people,"},"3390":{"dur":1,"text":"and think they know more things than they do."},"3392":{"dur":1,"text":"Rich people have a lot more leisure time"},"3393":{"dur":2,"text":"for doing things like devoting themselves to politics."},"3396":{"dur":1,"text":"Rich people, probably the most"},"3398":{"dur":1,"text":"important thing rich people are able to do"},"3399":{"dur":1,"text":"is to buy friends."},"3401":{"dur":1,"text":"That's what they do, right?"},"3402":{"dur":2,"text":"That's what rich people do, they buy friends."},"3404":{"dur":3,"text":"That's what banks do now and they buy friends in government."},"3408":{"dur":3,"text":"They buy friends and those people follow them."},"3411":{"dur":2,"text":"So the rich have all kinds of advantages,"},"3414":{"dur":2,"text":"and they used those advantages in a democratic

this year."},"3439":{"dur":4,"text":"But even without 2016, we've proved it over and over again."},"3443":{"dur":1,"text":"That why the lottery system in Athens,"},"3445":{"dur":1,"text":"they had this Council of 500 where,"},"3446":{"dur":3,"text":"common Athenians were chosen by lot to serve on the council."},"3450":{"dur":1,"text":"Now if you could just imagine, again,"},"3452":{"dur":2,"text":"see I'm slipping back into the democracy trap."},"3454":{"dur":1,"text":"What if we had this?"},"3456":{"dur":1,"text":"If you just imagine a Congress"},"3458":{"dur":2,"text":"where we didn't elect 545 people,"},"3461":{"dur":2,"text":"but we sent a 100 to the Senate"},"3463":{"dur":2,"text":"and 445 into the House of Representatives every
