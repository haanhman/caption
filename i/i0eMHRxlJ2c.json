We've been\nworking on our triggering, so when Real-Time"},"306":{"dur":4,"text":"shows up in our search results, it's incredibly\nrelevant.

You now"},"343":{"dur":4,"text":"get spell corrections before you even do your\nsearch. They show up there right underneath"},"347":{"dur":5,"text":"the search box. We've also made great strides\nin how to handle proper nouns and really do"},"352":{"dur":7,"text":"complicated spelling corrections. We've also\nrolled out enhancements to our Questions & Answers."},"360":{"dur":4,"text":"Two years ago in 2008, at an event much like\nthis, we rolled out a product called Google"},"364":{"dur":5,"text":"Squared, which was a technology demonstration\nthat showed how we could intuit facts from"},"369":{"dur":5,"text":"the data on the web. We've taken the technology\nbehind Google Squared and launched it as part"},"375":{"dur":5,"text":"of our core web search. So today, you can\ntype small questions or facts into Google"},"381":{"dur":4,"text":"Search and get answer right on the top of\nthe Results page. Like the inventor of the"},"385":{"dur":5,"text":"telephone. It just says Alexander Graham Bell.\nAnd it also works for real-time events as"},"391":{"dur":4,"text":"well and current events. You can type things\nlike \"Iron Man 2 release date\" and it'll give"},"396":{"dur":5,"text":"the release date right on top of the Search\nResults page. And we've also rolled out Stars"},"402":{"dur":4,"text":"in Search. We're constantly working to make\nGoogle Search more personalized. And through"},"406":{"dur":4,"text":"our experiments with products like Search\nWiki, what we found was that users really"},"410":{"dur":5,"text":"wanted to be able to bookmark results. To\nsay, \"This URL I want at the top of this search"},"416":{"dur":3,"text":"in the future and any related search, and\nI also want a way to be able to get back to"},"419":{"dur":6,"text":"it easily.\" We now have Stars in Search rolled\nout on all users who are signed in for all"},"426":{"dur":3,"text":"their searches and with a Star accompanying\neach search result, so it's always easy to"},"430":{"dur":5,"text":"bookmark a result and be able to come back\nto it. And finally, in April we rolled out"},"435":{"dur":5,"text":"our redesign.

How people\ndo Search. The speed and ease with which people"},"582":{"dur":5,"text":"can find information. And as such, and to\nput today's announcement in perspective, I"},"587":{"dur":5,"text":"thought I should offer some insight into the\nevolution of how people find information."},"593":{"dur":5,"text":"We're here today at the MOMA. The MOMA has\nan amazing permanent collection, and one of"},"598":{"dur":5,"text":"the most important pieces in it is Woman with\na Hat by Henri Matisse. Woman with a Hat was"},"603":{"dur":7,"text":"painted in 1905. It actually is Matisse's\nwife, Amelie. When she posed for the painting,"},"610":{"dur":6,"text":"she was actually dressed entirely in black.\nA black dress and a black hat. And as Matisse"},"617":{"dur":4,"text":"painted this painting, a new art movement\nwas born called Fauvism, where the focus is"},"622":{"dur":4,"text":"on painterly technique and the use of bright\ncolors even when bright colors don't appear"},"626":{"dur":4,"text":"in the subject. It's a very important piece.\nIt's a very special piece that the MOMA has"},"631":{"dur":4,"text":"here on site. But if you wanted to be able\nto find out all of the information and trivia"},"636":{"dur":5,"text":"that I just rattled off about--about Woman\nwith a Hat, say, 75 years ago when the MOMA"},"642":{"dur":7,"text":"first opened in 1935, you would've probably\nhad to have spend half a day to a day in a"},"649":{"dur":4,"text":"library. You would've physically had to have\ngone to the library. You would've had to find"},"653":{"dur":4,"text":"references to the painting. You would've had\nto stitch together all of these different"},"657":{"dur":5,"text":"facts to really understand what was happening\nwith this painting. If you move forward to"},"663":{"dur":5,"text":"1950, things get a little bit faster, mostly\nbecause of the prevalence of telephones. With"},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"the telephone, you could basically skip the\nstep of actually going to the library. You"},"673":{"dur":3,"text":"could call a librarian. You'd still have to\nverify that you were talking about the right"},"676":{"dur":4,"text":"painting and getting the right information,\nbut you could get the information probably"},"680":{"dur":6,"text":"in, say, about half an hour. Fast forward\nto 1995. Here personal computers come into"},"687":{"dur":5,"text":"play. There were CD-ROM-based encyclopedias,\nand as long as your encyclopedia had an entry"},"692":{"dur":4,"text":"for Woman with a Hat, you could find this\ninformation probably in the matter--in a matter"},"697":{"dur":4,"text":"of minutes. But the problem with that is that\nit was static information. It didn't really"},"702":{"dur":6,"text":"tell you is the piece on display right now?\nYou know, is it on tour? Where is the piece?"},"708":{"dur":5,"text":"This is my favorite piece in the San Francisco\nMOMA's permanent collection. It's Roy Lichtenstein's"},"713":{"dur":4,"text":"Mirror #1. And I come here often to see it.\nAnd I will say that sometimes it's here, and"},"718":{"dur":5,"text":"sometimes it's not. And it's really hard to\ntell when it's going to be here or not. But"},"724":{"dur":4,"text":"when you look at Search and how it plays out\ntoday, this is where the power of the internet"},"728":{"dur":4,"text":"really comes into play, because you can have\nreal-time information. So, for example, if"},"732":{"dur":5,"text":"you search for \"Lichtenstein mirror SFMOMA,\"\nin the snippets you can actually see that"},"738":{"dur":4,"text":"the mirror in on display in the second floor,\nand if it's on tour, it notes it on the web"},"742":{"dur":4,"text":"page. This is something that's really wonderful,\nand it actually has taken search time from"},"746":{"dur":5,"text":"that half a day to a day that we saw in 1935\nto about half a minute. But let's go ahead"},"752":{"dur":5,"text":"and take a look at where time is really spent\nin a search. We know that it takes a user"},"758":{"dur":6,"text":"on average about nine seconds to enter their\nsearch into Google. After they hit the Search"},"764":{"dur":5,"text":"button, it comes to us. There's some network\ntime. Spends about 300 milliseconds on our"},"770":{"dur":6,"text":"servers on average. Goes back over the network.\nAnd then after it renders on their page, they"},"776":{"dur":6,"text":"spend about 15 seconds on average picking\nthe right result for them. As you can imagine,"},"783":{"dur":5,"text":"because we are so focused on speed--never\nunderestimate fast--we have spent a lot of"},"788":{"dur":5,"text":"time optimizing the 300 milliseconds when\nthe search is on our servers. Making our algorithms"},"794":{"dur":4,"text":"more efficient. Making our computers more\nefficient. Really trying to makes sure that"},"799":{"dur":5,"text":"we have Search as fast and as efficient as\nabsolutely possible while it's on our servers."},"804":{"dur":5,"text":"We've also spent some time thinking about\nnetwork time. This is what our Fiber-to-the-Home"},"810":{"dur":3,"text":"project is about; helping people understand\nhow fast their connection could be, how fast"},"814":{"dur":6,"text":"it should be and really pushing on this. Also\nwe have tools like Google Chrome, which really"},"820":{"dur":5,"text":"don't focus on network time but do focus on\nrendering time and other overhead in the browser"},"825":{"dur":6,"text":"to really try and make people's experience\nwith the internet as fast and clean as possible."},"831":{"dur":5,"text":"But despite all that emphasis on optimizing,\nyou might say, \"Well, a search takes 25 seconds,"},"837":{"dur":5,"text":"and all of that focus is really on only one\nof the 25 seconds.\" Of course, there's 24"},"842":{"dur":5,"text":"other seconds of typing and thinking that\na user really spends. And you might say, \"Well,"},"848":{"dur":5,"text":"but is it possible to even optimize that?\"\nAnd in truth, we actually have tried to optimize"},"853":{"dur":4,"text":"it. For entering a query, we've added features\nto our search engine like auto complete, so"},"858":{"dur":4,"text":"when you're typing a query, popular completions\nshow up right there so you can do less typing"},"862":{"dur":4,"text":"and enter your search faster. On selecting\na result, we'll do things like the Google"},"867":{"dur":6,"text":"redesign to help people scan the page and\nfind information even faster because of the"},"874":{"dur":5,"text":"overall layout. But you may realize that at\nsome point we're really up against the fact"},"879":{"dur":4,"text":"that entering a query, there's a physical\nspeed for typing, and in terms of selecting"},"884":{"dur":7,"text":"a result, there's a physical speed for thinking.\nAnd this is where we really say, you know,"},"891":{"dur":5,"text":"can we optimize Search even more? Is it possible\nto make it even faster? And in the past few"},"897":{"dur":4,"text":"months at Google, we've had a key insight.\nWe think it is possible. We think it's possible"},"901":{"dur":4,"text":"to have a system that provides a user with\nan easier way to enter a query with a lot"},"906":{"dur":7,"text":"of feedback, and ultimately make Search very,\nvery efficient. And we call that product Google"},"913":{"dur":8,"text":"Instant. And that's what we're launching today.\nSo, Google Instant actually gets queries and"},"921":{"dur":5,"text":"gets your search results as you type and brings\nthem to you and streams those results right"},"927":{"dur":4,"text":"to your computer, so the search is entirely\ninteractive the whole time you're typing."},"931":{"dur":4,"text":"And because it's so interactive, we really\ndo need to show a demo. So I'm going to go"},"936":{"dur":5,"text":"over to the demo computer, and I have Dan\nhere, who's going to take a picture--we have"},"942":{"dur":4,"text":"a picture-in-picture that'll show up here\nin a second, uh, so you can actually see what"},"946":{"dur":6,"text":"I'm typing and what actually happens onscreen.\nSo, let's go back to the Woman with a Hat."},"953":{"dur":4,"text":"Let's say we couldn't remember the specific\nname of this painting, and we just remembered"},"958":{"dur":5,"text":"there's an important painting at the SFMOMA.\nIt has a woman in it. You know, how does Google"},"963":{"dur":3,"text":"Instant work? Well, the first thing you'll\nsee if that Google Instant, it just is--it"},"967":{"dur":4,"text":"is and looks like the main Search Results\npage--the main home page that you've always"},"971":{"dur":7,"text":"been accustomed to. So if I go ahead and start\ntyping my query and type S-F-M you'll see"},"979":{"dur":5,"text":"I did not hit return, and the results for\nS-F-M, and actually for SFMOMA, because that's"},"985":{"dur":7,"text":"the predicted--the predicted query, are already\non the page. So with just three keystrokes,"},"992":{"dur":4,"text":"we actually already have the result for the\nSan Francisco MOMA. If I say, okay, that's"},"997":{"dur":6,"text":"great. I typed S-F-M. The prediction of SFMOMA\nis right. I'll go ahead and tab, and then"},"1003":{"dur":3,"text":"I'll just type \"woman\" to try and find the\nname of the painting. And again, just six"},"1007":{"dur":6,"text":"keystrokes later, we already know that, in\nfact, the painting is called Femme au chapeau,"},"1014":{"dur":6,"text":"Woman with a Hat. So it's just that fast and\nthat interactive. The results with each keystroke."},"1021":{"dur":5,"text":"No hitting the Search button. No hitting Return.\nThe results just stream to you based on the"},"1026":{"dur":5,"text":"predictions that are most likely, uh, given\nyour--given what you've typed so far. So let's"},"1032":{"dur":5,"text":"go ahead and actually do a look up on the\nformal name of the painting, which is French."},"1037":{"dur":7,"text":"Femme au chapeau. If I type \"femme au\", what\nyou'll see here is that the most likely completion"},"1045":{"dur":6,"text":"is a Picasso painting, Woman with Crossed\nArms. But you can also see five other searches"},"1051":{"dur":5,"text":"here right below the search box. And I can\ndo those searches by simply using my up and"},"1057":{"dur":6,"text":"down arrow keys. So you'll note here that\nall I do is press down. Does that search."},"1063":{"dur":5,"text":"\"Women with chocolate.\" Uh, and then you can\nkeep going through the search results and"},"1068":{"dur":6,"text":"they just update. So as you scroll up and\ndown the overall recommendations and predictions,"},"1075":{"dur":6,"text":"you can see the results right there. No more\ntyping. You can explore the whole space of"},"1081":{"dur":7,"text":"your query, Femme au chapeau, and all of the\nrelated queries. Let's go ahead and take a"},"1088":{"dur":6,"text":"lot at Fauvism. Fauvism is the painting movement\nthat actually came into play with Woman with"},"1095":{"dur":7,"text":"a Hat. And if we type \"Fauvism\", what you'll\nsee is--if I type F-A-U-V, it's already figured"},"1102":{"dur":4,"text":"out that I'm likely to type Fauvism. So with\njust four characters, I already have a definition"},"1107":{"dur":6,"text":"of Fauvism, pictures and paintings that show\nexamples of it, mm-hmm. And you'll note that"},"1113":{"dur":6,"text":"a lot of people think Google Instant is search\nas you type, but it's actually search before"},"1119":{"dur":5,"text":"you type. We didn't do a search for F-A-U-V.\nWe did a search for Fauvism, because that"},"1125":{"dur":6,"text":"was the most likely completion. So we're actually\npredicting what query you're likely to do"},"1131":{"dur":4,"text":"and giving you results for that. We think\nthis ultimately results in a much higher quality"},"1135":{"dur":5,"text":"experience, but there's even a psychic element\nof it in that we can actually predict what"},"1141":{"dur":5,"text":"you're likely to type and bring you those\nresults in real time. And the other cool thing"},"1146":{"dur":3,"text":"is using the predictions, you can build--you\ncan build your query much more easily. So"},"1150":{"dur":5,"text":"let's go back to the Lichtenstein mirror.\nIf I type Lichtenstein. L-I-C-H-T. Google's"},"1156":{"dur":4,"text":"already figured out that I'm likely to type\nLichtenstein. Doesn't know is it the artist"},"1161":{"dur":5,"text":"or the country, but I can hit Tab, then type\nM-I for \"mirror\", and again, it's already"},"1166":{"dur":6,"text":"figured out that I'm likely to type mirror.\nHit Tab. Hit S-F. And there's the page on"},"1173":{"dur":7,"text":"the Lichtenstein mirror here at the MOMA.\nWe're really excited about what Google Instant"},"1180":{"dur":5,"text":"means in terms of Search. It means much faster\nSearch, easier Search, an easier way to explore"},"1185":{"dur":6,"text":"all of the related queries around the query\nthat you're doing, and really providing results"},"1192":{"dur":5,"text":"in real time before you've even had the--had\nthe opportunity to type your query. We're"},"1197":{"dur":6,"text":"really ultimately excited about this. Let's\ngo ahead and go back to slide. This is funny."},"1204":{"dur":5,"text":"This is something that I don't know if many\nof you have seen, but in 2000, we actually"},"1209":{"dur":6,"text":"thought that this idea of being able to search\nbefore someone typed was so far out it was"},"1215":{"dur":5,"text":"actually our April Fool's Day joke. I was\ncalled MentalPlex, and it says, be sure to"},"1220":{"dur":5,"text":"remove your hat and glasses. Look into the\ncircle. Think about what you want to search"},"1225":{"dur":4,"text":"and present it. And so we thought this was\nsort of a fun--fun bit of Google history,"},"1230":{"dur":4,"text":"and that obviously dovetails with today, because\njust ten years later, what we're seeing is"},"1235":{"dur":6,"text":"it's actually possible for us to greatly ease\nthe entering of a query, greatly ease the"},"1241":{"dur":7,"text":"scanning of results, and really speed up the\nGoogle Search experience.

In Google Instant, the first"},"1450":{"dur":9,"text":"gear is Instant Results. The second is our\nset of Predictions. And the third is what"},"1460":{"dur":8,"text":"we call \"Scroll to Search.\" Let's jump in,\nand let's start by taking a look at Instant"},"1468":{"dur":6,"text":"Results. Immediately when you start typing,\nresults display on the screen instantly. There's"},"1474":{"dur":7,"text":"no need to finish typing. There's no need\nto hit Enter.

And, Othar, we're\nhere in San Francisco. Why don't you use Google"},"1491":{"dur":3,"text":"to check out the weather?\n>> HANSSON: Sure. This is a great search for"},"1494":{"dur":5,"text":"Google Instant, because with exactly one key\npress, on W, I can get a weather forecast"},"1499":{"dur":10,"text":"for San Francisco.

This summer, I, and maybe many\nof you in this room, read the book \"The Girl"},"1542":{"dur":5,"text":"with the Dragon Tattoo.\" I don't think Othar\nread it. He's making fun of me there."},"1547":{"dur":2,"text":">> HANSSON: I was a little busy.

So to prove my point, I've already\nforgotten the title, but I have faith in Google"},"1571":{"dur":5,"text":"Instant, so I'll just start typing \"the girl,\"\nand there you go. This look like a book. I"},"1577":{"dur":3,"text":"scan down to the results. It's a book that's\nbeen made into a movie. Is this the one you"},"1580":{"dur":1,"text":"had in mind?\n>> WRIGHT: It sure is."},"1582":{"dur":5,"text":">> HANSSON: That's great.

The rest of the search is in gray text."},"1592":{"dur":6,"text":"We call this the Prediction. And the way--people\nintuitively focus on the Search box while"},"1598":{"dur":5,"text":"they're typing. So the gray text is a great\ncue as to what Google thinks you're searching"},"1604":{"dur":3,"text":"for. And in this case, this looked enough\nlike a book title that it was worth my while"},"1607":{"dur":4,"text":"to scan down to the results and see if it\nwas, in fact, the book title you had in mind."},"1612":{"dur":6,"text":">> WRIGHT: The real power is in tying that\ngray prediction to the Instant Results.

It's not quite psychic,"},"1626":{"dur":5,"text":"but it is very clever.\n>> WRIGHT: Our third feature today is what"},"1631":{"dur":4,"text":"we call \"Scroll to Search.\" And this summer\nwhen I was planning my summer vacation, Othar"},"1635":{"dur":2,"text":"told me about a trip he and his wife had taken\nto Yosemite."},"1638":{"dur":3,"text":">> HANSSON: Oh, yeah.\n>> WRIGHT: And this search, Yosemite, actually"},"1641":{"dur":4,"text":"shows off Scroll to Search quite nicely.\n>> HANSSON: And it has great sentimental value--first"},"1646":{"dur":5,"text":"trip my wife and I took.

This is a great way to explore,\num, aspects very quickly of things that you're"},"1693":{"dur":6,"text":"searching for, and we call this third feature\n\"Scroll to Search.\" Now that we've talked"},"1699":{"dur":6,"text":"about the three components of Google Instant,\nour next topic is feedback. The real power"},"1705":{"dur":8,"text":"is when these three components-- Instant Results,\nPredictions, and Scroll to Search--come together."},"1713":{"dur":4,"text":"This turns Google into a system that gives\nyou feedback as you go along. So one thing"},"1718":{"dur":4,"text":"that happens to me today is when I'm searching,\nI'll type something in, and I'll hit Enter,"},"1723":{"dur":3,"text":"and I'll see if I got the right results. And\nsometimes I do, sometimes I don't. And if"},"1726":{"dur":3,"text":"I didn't, I'll just do it again, and I'll\ndo it again until, finally, I get the right"},"1730":{"dur":3,"text":"answer.\n>> HANSSON: This happens to everyone. It's"},"1733":{"dur":4,"text":"happened to me. I've recently been planning\na trip back home to New York, and I want to"},"1738":{"dur":5,"text":"take my mom and her grandkids to a musical,\nget them some culture, and me too. Johanna,"},"1743":{"dur":3,"text":"you seem cultured. Do you have any musicals\nto recommend on Broadway?"},"1746":{"dur":4,"text":">> WRIGHT: I actually hear that they made\na musical out of my favorite movie, um, \"The"},"1751":{"dur":3,"text":"Addams Family.\"\n>> HANSSON: Okay, that sounded promising until"},"1754":{"dur":6,"text":"the title, but... Uh... So let's just search\nfor \"Addams Family\" and see what we get. We"},"1761":{"dur":5,"text":"get an ad for the musical. That's great. The\nresults seem to be mostly about the TV show"},"1766":{"dur":5,"text":"and the movies, so I'll just tab and type\nspace M, and now I get the musical, and now"},"1772":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm feeling like I'm on a roll, so I'll just\nsee if I can get tickets by adding space T."},"1776":{"dur":4,"text":"Yes, I can. I can buy tickets for today's\nperformance, if only we could get there in"},"1781":{"dur":2,"text":"time.\n>> WRIGHT: So let's decompose what happened"},"1783":{"dur":6,"text":"here. Othar typed in \"Addams Family,\" and\nthen the Instant Results gave him feedback"},"1790":{"dur":3,"text":"that he needed to type more, because he was\nlooking for the musical. He wasn't looking"},"1793":{"dur":5,"text":"for the movie. So he went ahead and added\nthe word \"musical\" to his search. Then since"},"1799":{"dur":4,"text":"he again was thinking he wanted to buy tickets,\nin a split second and in his mind's eye, he"},"1804":{"dur":5,"text":"said, \"No, I need to change my search. I'll\nadd the word 'tickets.'\" So now what had previously"},"1809":{"dur":8,"text":"been three searches became one search, and\nthis sped Othar up tremendously. [pause] So"},"1818":{"dur":4,"text":"that was our discussion of feedback, and we've\ndone a number of demos. And at this point"},"1822":{"dur":4,"text":"in our day, you guys might be thinking that\nthe Search button is feeling a bit lonely."},"1827":{"dur":5,"text":"What the heck is the Search button there for,\nanyway, at this point? Well, why don't we,"},"1833":{"dur":3,"text":"um--Well, what happens, actually, if we press\nthe Search button? Why don't we go ahead and"},"1836":{"dur":3,"text":"show you? Well, what we do is we give you\nthe same great results we always have. I'll"},"1840":{"dur":2,"text":"give it away. But why don't we go ahead and\ndo a search for New York?"},"1842":{"dur":4,"text":">> HANSSON: Sure. So you're right. The Search\nbutton--And the Enter key is the cleanest"},"1847":{"dur":6,"text":"key on my keyboard now. But if I search for\nNew York by typing \"NY,\" the best prediction"},"1854":{"dur":3,"text":"is actually that you want the \"New York Times.\"\nI'm sure someone in the audience is happy"},"1857":{"dur":4,"text":"to hear that. That's what the odds are. But\nif I just want NY and I type \"NY\" and then"},"1862":{"dur":6,"text":"either press Enter or press the Search button--once\nI found my mouse--then we do what we've always"},"1869":{"dur":4,"text":"done for 12 years. If you type NY and press\nthe Search button, we'll search for NY. That's"},"1874":{"dur":2,"text":"the natural thing to do.\n>> WRIGHT: Yeah, so Google works seamlessly"},"1876":{"dur":4,"text":"as it always has. All it does is it speeds\nyou up."},"1881":{"dur":4,"text":">> HANSSON: Exactly. So whenever you improve\na great product, you want to make sure that"},"1885":{"dur":3,"text":"everyone who's already using the product gets\na benefit out of the new version immediately."},"1889":{"dur":3,"text":"Everything they know how to do applies to\nthe new version. I had this experience recently"},"1893":{"dur":4,"text":"with bicycles. I had this great bike that\nI ride to work as often as I can, which is"},"1897":{"dur":7,"text":"not often enough. And I finally got a raise--hint,\nhint--and bought myself a better bike, in"},"1905":{"dur":3,"text":"the same line, just a better version. I went\nto the bike store, and they have this little"},"1908":{"dur":3,"text":"hill you can climb behind the bike store.\nAnd so I hopped on this bike. I knew how to"},"1912":{"dur":3,"text":"use it immediately--the great thing about\nbikes--and I climbed up the hill. And the"},"1916":{"dur":3,"text":"only thing that was different is I got to\nthe top of the hill in about half the time,"},"1919":{"dur":4,"text":"because the bike was faster and lighter and\nmore responsive. And that's what we're shooting"},"1924":{"dur":4,"text":"for with Google Instant. So on that day, I\ngot myself a better bike, and today we're"},"1929":{"dur":3,"text":"all getting a better Google.\n>> WRIGHT: So if you know how to use Google"},"1933":{"dur":5,"text":"Search right now, you know how to use Google\nInstant. It's just like riding a bicycle."},"1938":{"dur":7,"text":"Thanks for laughing. Okay, so let's do one\nlast demo to bring it all together. This last"},"1946":{"dur":5,"text":"demo's gonna come from another story between\nOthar and I. So I want to get a dog. Othar"},"1951":{"dur":3,"text":"has a dog, so I asked Othar to tell me about\nhis dog."},"1955":{"dur":3,"text":">> HANSSON: Well, in fact, during this project,\nwe scaled up everything at Google, so I went"},"1959":{"dur":5,"text":"from one dog to two. But we do have two tiny\ndogs. And they're tiny, but they have a big"},"1965":{"dur":6,"text":"name--Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. And something\nlike that is a great search example. I'll"},"1972":{"dur":4,"text":"meet people in the park, and the little kids\nwill say, \"Daddy, Daddy, I want a dog just"},"1976":{"dur":3,"text":"like that.\" \"I thought you want a pony.\" \"No,\nI want a dog just like that.\" And the dad"},"1980":{"dur":3,"text":"will ask me what's the name, and I'll tell\nthem Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. And I"},"1984":{"dur":3,"text":"know that an hour later they'll be at home,\nand they'll have no hope of remembering the"},"1987":{"dur":4,"text":"exact name. So half-remembered queries are\ngreat examples for us, 'cause let's say they"},"1992":{"dur":3,"text":"go home, and they start typing \"King Charles.\"\nThere you go."},"1996":{"dur":2,"text":">> WRIGHT: Aw.\n>> HANSSON: So with the Instant Results, you"},"1999":{"dur":4,"text":"immediately recognize, well, this is a dog,\nright? The name sounds vaguely like what I'm"},"2003":{"dur":5,"text":"looking for. And if I scan down or keep, uh,\nsearching, I see, oh, it's the Cavalier King"},"2008":{"dur":4,"text":"Charles Spaniel. So that's, in fact, what\nI was looking for, even though I started searching"},"2013":{"dur":5,"text":"in, you know, not an exactly correct way.\nThe other great thing about a search like"},"2018":{"dur":5,"text":"this is ambiguity, right? So dog people call\nthese dogs \"Cavaliers.\" Now, there are other"},"2024":{"dur":5,"text":"things in the world called Cavaliers, right?\nNow, we could have a little game here where"},"2029":{"dur":5,"text":"I ask you to bet which one is the most common,\nbut basically, people can't know this, right?"},"2034":{"dur":5,"text":"So if I start typing \"cavaliers,\" it turns\nout that the basketball team, despite LeBron"},"2039":{"dur":6,"text":"James, still outranks my dog, and so I realize\nthat I have to keep typing. And if I just"},"2046":{"dur":6,"text":"type \"cavalier k,\" the feedback from the Instant\nResults and the Prediction show me that, okay,"},"2052":{"dur":4,"text":"now I'm on the dog. So I see the results for\nthe dog, but, Johanna, back to your original"},"2057":{"dur":5,"text":"point that you need a dog. I think that you\nreally need to get puppies to match the size"},"2063":{"dur":4,"text":"of your kids. And if you can, I think you\nshould get the dogs that are the color that"},"2068":{"dur":3,"text":"mine are--tricolored dogs.\n>> WRIGHT: Those are pretty cute."},"2071":{"dur":3,"text":">> HANSSON: So if you get two and I bring\nmy two to work, we can have playdates all"},"2075":{"dur":2,"text":"the time, never get any work done. That'll\nbe awesome."},"2077":{"dur":4,"text":">> WRIGHT: So just with all the demos, what\nhappened here is Othar started typing in \"cavaliers,\""},"2082":{"dur":3,"text":"and then he got the feedback from the Instant\nResults, telling him that he had to go ahead"},"2086":{"dur":4,"text":"and type a little more and add the word \"king.\"\nThis gave him the right results. He used the"},"2091":{"dur":4,"text":"Predictions to understand that Google had\nguessed correctly, and then he went ahead"},"2095":{"dur":6,"text":"and he used Scroll to Search to down-arrow\nand see the cute pictures of puppies. So those"},"2102":{"dur":6,"text":"are, um--those conclude our demos of what\nwe're launching today, but we also have a"},"2108":{"dur":3,"text":"sneak preview of something that will be coming\nout this fall. Do you want to go ahead and"},"2112":{"dur":2,"text":"show that off?\n>> HANSSON: Yes. So at Google, we normally"},"2114":{"dur":4,"text":"don't speak in the future tense, but we are\nworking very hard to get this experience to"},"2119":{"dur":4,"text":"you on Mobile. When you're on your phone,\nfirst of all, you're on the go. You're probably"},"2124":{"dur":4,"text":"in a hurry, so Google Instant can help you\nmore. But more importantly, typing on a phone,"},"2129":{"dur":5,"text":"no matter what kind of phone you have, is\njust slower. So the feedback from Google Instant"},"2134":{"dur":6,"text":"is even more useful. So let's start searching\nfor, uh, one of these art queries that Marissa"},"2140":{"dur":4,"text":"was doing. We'll search for \"Roy Lichtenstein.\"\nNow I'm halfway through, and I don't know"},"2145":{"dur":4,"text":"how to spell Lichtenstein, but I assume it\nstarts with an L, and the feedback shows me"},"2150":{"dur":5,"text":"that I'm getting Roy Lichtenstein, and the\nImage results show me that I've got the artist."},"2155":{"dur":6,"text":"So now I can scroll down to check out more\ninformation about Roy Lichtenstein. So you"},"2161":{"dur":3,"text":"can check this out later this fall, and you\ncan also check it out later today at the demo"},"2165":{"dur":4,"text":"stations outside.\n>> WRIGHT: Our group at Google is focused"},"2170":{"dur":6,"text":"on making Search faster and easier for everybody\nto use. As part of our process, we test all"},"2176":{"dur":4,"text":"of our features on a number of users and gain\nfeedback and improve the products as we go"},"2181":{"dur":5,"text":"along. We were lucky enough today that a handful\nof our testers have been willing to share"},"2187":{"dur":5,"text":"their thoughts with you all and have given\nus some testimonials. So let's go ahead and"},"2192":{"dur":6,"text":"take a look at what they had to say.\n>> As I was typing, things were already showing"},"2198":{"dur":1,"text":"up.\n>> Oh, wow."},"2200":{"dur":3,"text":">> I don't even have to scroll.

It's always great"},"2258":{"dur":5,"text":"to come to work and listen to our users and\nhear them say things like, \"Oh, wow, that's"},"2263":{"dur":4,"text":"fabulous. This is gonna help me a lot. And\nwhen is this launching?\" Well, the answer"},"2267":{"dur":4,"text":"is today. Under the hood, obviously, there's\na huge amount of engineering work that has"},"2272":{"dur":3,"text":"gone into this project, and so Ben Gomes is\ngonna join me now to talk about the engineering"},"2276":{"dur":8,"text":"challenges. [pause]\n>> GOMES: So when we first began to demo this"},"2285":{"dur":5,"text":"product and this idea around the company,\nwe got several responses. Some people said"},"2290":{"dur":4,"text":"that we just could not do this. It was just\ngonna be too expensive. Other people said"},"2295":{"dur":4,"text":"we must not do this, because it was gonna\nbe too complex a change. But then we showed"},"2299":{"dur":4,"text":"it to users, and then we showed it to some\nimportant people at the company, and they"},"2304":{"dur":5,"text":"said we must do it, and we must do it now.\nSo we all came together to figure out how"},"2309":{"dur":5,"text":"we could make this vision a reality. And the\nchallenges fall into three areas. The first"},"2314":{"dur":4,"text":"challenge is the user interface. How do we\ncreate a user interface that's really simple"},"2319":{"dur":5,"text":"to use and that's familiar to people? The\nsecond challenge is how do we make it work"},"2324":{"dur":5,"text":"on your computer, on your browser, with your\nconnection. And the third challenge, which"},"2329":{"dur":4,"text":"is probably the biggest challenge of all,\nis how do we possibly do this without melting"},"2333":{"dur":5,"text":"down our data centers. So let me start with\nthe first challenge. How do we come up with"},"2338":{"dur":4,"text":"the user interface? We started out with this\nrough idea. We want to give you feedback as"},"2343":{"dur":6,"text":"you type your query. It seemed that that would\nhelp you formulate a better query. In fact,"},"2349":{"dur":4,"text":"somebody at Google had done this demo way\nback in the mists of time, and engineer named"},"2354":{"dur":4,"text":"Amit Patel. And what it did was very literally\nsearch as you type. So I'm searching for bike"},"2359":{"dur":6,"text":"helmets. I type in \"B-I-K-E H.\" Now what do\nwe search for--\"bike h.\" Now what are the"},"2366":{"dur":6,"text":"chances that you were searching for H? It's\nalmost zero. So what happens is that we end"},"2372":{"dur":5,"text":"up doing a ton of work that's entirely useless\nwith these useless queries. You end up seeing"},"2378":{"dur":5,"text":"results that are entirely useless to you.\nSo it's a lose-lose proposition. And with"},"2383":{"dur":3,"text":"no offense to Amit, this was not something\nthat could work. We knew we needed something"},"2387":{"dur":3,"text":"different. We needed to work with those partial\nqueries."},"2390":{"dur":5,"text":">> HANSSON: Exactly. So the best way to make\nthis useful was to take your partial query"},"2396":{"dur":4,"text":"and complete it to a full search. Thankfully,\nin the meantime, between ancient history and"},"2400":{"dur":6,"text":"today, we launched Autocomplete. So Autocomplete\nfilled that role of completing partial searches."},"2407":{"dur":4,"text":"Now we just have to build a user interface\naround this.

I'm sure people"},"2699":{"dur":3,"text":"will dissect this anyway, so might as well\nexplain how it works. I've always wanted to"},"2703":{"dur":6,"text":"use this analogy, so let's pretend I'm the\nclient and my boss is the server. So I'm the"},"2709":{"dur":5,"text":"client.

So now I can show the instant\nresults. We saw in the little video that the"},"2737":{"dur":5,"text":"person anticipated that they'd be there.

We might have"},"2746":{"dur":3,"text":"clicked on a result from a previous, you know,\nset of results. I might have typed in some"},"2750":{"dur":5,"text":"unpredictable direction, etcetera. We send\nother Autocomplete Requests to the servers,"},"2755":{"dur":4,"text":"and the servers figure it out amongst themselves\nwhether the search they just finished is still"},"2760":{"dur":2,"text":"relevant to the user.\n>> GOMES: And cancel some searches."},"2762":{"dur":4,"text":">> HANSSON: Yeah. So that's one optimization\nwe did. We also had to do all kinds of JavaScript"},"2766":{"dur":5,"text":"optimizations in different browsers. This\nexperience doesn't work if the browser spends"},"2772":{"dur":6,"text":"more time rendering results than the, you\nknow, time between results arriving. So we"},"2778":{"dur":5,"text":"had to optimize our JavaScript and work around\nbrowser performance issues. The other thing"},"2783":{"dur":4,"text":"we had to do in our JavaScript was actually\ndetect when the experience was broken. You"},"2788":{"dur":4,"text":"might go from one cafe to another, and the\ninternet speed, you know, drops dramatically."},"2792":{"dur":5,"text":"So we wanna detect that and proactively opt\nyou out of the experience and give you a little"},"2798":{"dur":4,"text":"error message, giving you a hint as to what's\nhappened.

So think about"},"2817":{"dur":4,"text":"the problem. We want to give you search results\nwith every letter. An average query's about"},"2822":{"dur":5,"text":"20 letters long. So if we give you search\nresults with every character, that's 20 queries"},"2827":{"dur":5,"text":"for every search you do.

Why would we\nplan for like 20 times--20--a factor of 20"},"2853":{"dur":5,"text":"growth in Search traffic? So this was one\nof the most interesting challenges in getting"},"2858":{"dur":3,"text":"this down to something practical that we could\nactually do."},"2861":{"dur":5,"text":">> HANSSON: Thankfully, Google has thousands\nof engineers who love challenges like this,"},"2867":{"dur":5,"text":"many of them in our Search infrastructure\ngroup. And they came to us at first skeptical."},"2872":{"dur":3,"text":"They would say things like, \"You're never\ngonna launch this.\" But I realized last night"},"2875":{"dur":4,"text":"while running a load test that if you did\nthis and that, you could save 27%, and here's"},"2880":{"dur":3,"text":"a simulator that, you know, shows you how\nto do it. And then someone else would say,"},"2884":{"dur":4,"text":"I realize that if you just made this optimization\nhere, you could probably save another 12%."},"2889":{"dur":4,"text":"And if enough of these skeptical, helpful\npeople come together, you get enough optimizations"},"2894":{"dur":4,"text":"to get to the finish line. So let's just look\nat a couple of these optimizations. So the"},"2898":{"dur":4,"text":"first was realizing that some searches are\nmore important than others, where more confidence"},"2903":{"dur":5,"text":"given, you know, like a single letter that--in\nsome predictions than in others. So we wanna"},"2909":{"dur":5,"text":"make sure we serve those results to you as\nfast as possible. And that, you know, by prioritizing"},"2914":{"dur":3,"text":"searches differently, we can reduce the average\ncost per search and the number of searches"},"2918":{"dur":5,"text":"we do. The next optimization is this thing\nwe alluded to before in the client\/server"},"2923":{"dur":5,"text":"aspect--that if the servers can keep track\nof what the browser either already has or"},"2928":{"dur":4,"text":"what's already in progress for them on some\nother server, then we don't have to do needless"},"2933":{"dur":6,"text":"work. We can, uh, reduce the number of searches\nthat way. A final and pretty sophisticated"},"2939":{"dur":4,"text":"improvement we made was in our caching system.\nSo caching is always a tension for Google"},"2944":{"dur":4,"text":"because we want our results to be as fresh\nas possible as we crawl and index the web."},"2948":{"dur":5,"text":"But we also want them to be cached so we can\nserve them to users as quickly as possible."},"2954":{"dur":4,"text":"So this was one of, you know, the most sophisticated\nthings we built.
