perspective,"},"938":{"dur":1,"text":"it was, launch the different languages"},"939":{"dur":1,"text":"and you do see an up-tick"},"941":{"dur":1,"text":"when you launch different languages."},"943":{"dur":2,"text":"And then the second piece of it"},"946":{"dur":2,"text":"is giving them that ability to pay."},"948":{"dur":3,"text":"So that was really our only\ninitial global strategy."},"951":{"dur":1,"text":"- Got it, and how about"},"953":{"dur":2,"text":"any pattern differences on virality?"},"955":{"dur":2,"text":"- Globally? Absolutely."},"957":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a huge difference both"},"959":{"dur":1,"text":"in terms of virality globally..."},"961":{"dur":4,"text":"And that is based on the number of years"},"965":{"dur":3,"text":"into how much that brand\nhas been in market."},"969":{"dur":2,"text":"Because when you're\ndepending upon a viral funnel"},"972":{"dur":1,"text":"you're very much depending\nupon the fact that"},"973":{"dur":3,"text":"that customer has awareness of the brand."},"976":{"dur":3,"text":"And so you start seeing\nimpact when people oversee"},"979":{"dur":2,"text":"their second, third,\nfourth, fifth surveys."},"982":{"dur":3,"text":"And then you start getting\nmore of the viral funnel going."},"986":{"dur":1,"text":"And that was actually\ntrue at Evite as well."},"988":{"dur":3,"text":"At Evite you had an average\nof 18 invitees to one user,"},"991":{"dur":2,"text":"but you needed to receive\na certain number of evites"},"994":{"dur":1,"text":"before you then created."},"996":{"dur":2,"text":"And so when you're thinking\nabout those viral models,"},"998":{"dur":1,"text":"you have to think about there's like"},"999":{"dur":1,"text":"the primary step viral models"},"1001":{"dur":2,"text":"and then these secondary\nstep viral models."},"1003":{"dur":2,"text":"- And how many like different

point."},"1013":{"dur":1,"text":"That was the other\nthing we did right away."},"1015":{"dur":1,"text":"We launched A\/B testing."},"1017":{"dur":3,"text":"It was fascinating to\nrealize that, you

was the page when you\nfinished taking the survey."},"1038":{"dur":2,"text":"Start testing, you know, do\nyou want to check out flow"},"1040":{"dur":2,"text":"that's three pages versus five pages?"},"1043":{"dur":1,"text":"How do you want to show your pricing page?"},"1045":{"dur":1,"text":"And just your experience."},"1047":{"dur":3,"text":"And we just started heavily,\nheavily A\/B

have."},"1070":{"dur":2,"text":"Because you suddenly have that traffic"},"1072":{"dur":2,"text":"to start seeing user behavior."},"1074":{"dur":2,"text":"- We did something,"},"1076":{"dur":3,"text":"our first hack on this\nwithin LinkedIn was,"},"1080":{"dur":3,"text":"we actually set up a simple\nA\/B testing infrastructure"},"1083":{"dur":2,"text":"that

ready for boot scaling"},"1115":{"dur":2,"text":"was when you began to do\nthis kind of metrization,"},"1117":{"dur":1,"text":"what did that mean for dashboards?"},"1119":{"dur":1,"text":"What did that mean for analytics?"},"1120":{"dur":2,"text":"What did that mean for data?"},"1122":{"dur":4,"text":"- So, there were no analytics before 2009."},"1126":{"dur":2,"text":"Like there was the Daily Cash Report"},"1128":{"dur":1,"text":"and that was it."},"1130":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, as far as understanding\nand first establishing"},"1134":{"dur":1,"text":"what were the key metrics"},"1135":{"dur":1,"text":"that we actually wanted to establish."},"1137":{"dur":2,"text":"And I strongly believe,\nyou as a whole company"},"1139":{"dur":2,"text":"can't get initially behind\nmore than three to five,"},"1142":{"dur":2,"text":"and then there was the\ndrivers underneath it."},"1144":{"dur":1,"text":"So the fist thing we needed to do"},"1146":{"dur":2,"text":"was actually put the data\ninto a data warehouse"},"1148":{"dur":2,"text":"and then actually start\nlooking at the data."},"1150":{"dur":2,"text":"But then we started to having to build"},"1152":{"dur":1,"text":"all the dashboards globally."},"1154":{"dur":2,"text":"You have an activity dashboard,"},"1157":{"dur":1,"text":"which is what people are doing,"},"1158":{"dur":3,"text":"your metrics dashboard in terms\nof your subscriber counts."},"1161":{"dur":2,"text":"But we have different dashboards."},"1164":{"dur":2,"text":"And everything sort of gets multiplied"},"1167":{"dur":1,"text":"by the number of countries."},"1169":{"dur":1,"text":"So there's more to watch."},"1170":{"dur":1,"text":"But for a subscription-based business,"},"1172":{"dur":2,"text":"which is probable the same as LinkedIn,"},"1174":{"dur":2,"text":"the key metrics are the\nnumber of free users,"},"1177":{"dur":2,"text":"your free users that become paying users."},"1179":{"dur":3,"text":"But for us the other main\nkey metric is engagement."},"1183":{"dur":3,"text":"So, how many users actually\ndeploy their

(Selina laughs)"},"1201":{"dur":4,"text":"And then after that, what was the plan?"},"1206":{"dur":2,"text":"- So, for an engineering side,"},"1208":{"dur":1,"text":"because we had chosen Python--"},"1210":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Reid] Oh, I didn't not\npromise to make you blush"},"1212":{"dur":1,"text":"while we were doing this.

to..."},"1219":{"dur":2,"text":"Oh, we hired our first Stanford intern,"},"1222":{"dur":2,"text":"who now runs all of our mobile."},"1224":{"dur":1,"text":"And so we came to Stanford"},"1225":{"dur":2,"text":"and did a bunch of recruiting here."},"1231":{"dur":3,"text":"Yeah, we did Python meetups and\ntried to get a lot of people"},"1234":{"dur":2,"text":"on the Python

hire effectively?"},"1261":{"dur":2,"text":"- So, it was funny because,"},"1263":{"dur":1,"text":"the recruiter still tells this story,"},"1265":{"dur":1,"text":"but basically sat me down,"},"1267":{"dur":1,"text":"I had just come from Europe,"},"1268":{"dur":1,"text":"and he had come from Google."},"1269":{"dur":1,"text":"And so he had all of this was still"},"1271":{"dur":2,"text":"when Google was hiring based on GPA"},"1273":{"dur":1,"text":"and all of this stuff."},"1275":{"dur":0,"text":"And he sat me down and he said,"},"1276":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Okay, so I've all these\ncriteria,\" he said,"},"1277":{"dur":1,"text":"\"What's your criteria?\""},"1279":{"dur":2,"text":"And I said, \"I want no assholes\nwho can

that was Dave's philosophy as well."},"1313":{"dur":1,"text":"He wrote a nice LinkedIn post about it."},"1315":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Reid] I remember."},"1316":{"dur":2,"text":"And how, as you scaled, how did you keep"},"1319":{"dur":3,"text":"that culture and hiring philosophy?"},"1322":{"dur":4,"text":"- So it's been important\nto us from the start."},"1326":{"dur":4,"text":"But we basically, it\ngoes into our screens,"},"1331":{"dur":1,"text":"such as we don't ask people..."},"1332":{"dur":1,"text":"people do code on a whiteboard."},"1334":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, like the engineers\nso code on the whiteboard,"},"1336":{"dur":2,"text":"but they can choose the\nlanguage of their choice,"},"1338":{"dur":1,"text":"as an example."},"1339":{"dur":1,"text":"And then, we ask everybody,"},"1341":{"dur":3,"text":"we've been trying to do the\nsort of unconscious bias,"},"1345":{"dur":3,"text":"like making sure we were interviewing"},"1348":{"dur":4,"text":"without trying to

situation?"},"1363":{"dur":2,"text":"Than necessarily asking someone"},"1366":{"dur":3,"text":"how they did something in the past."},"1369":{"dur":1,"text":"So I think that's been\na really important

doing the acquisitions?"},"1385":{"dur":1,"text":"- Dave liked doing deals."},"1387":{"dur":4,"text":"We did a major deal actually in 2012,"},"1392":{"dur":4,"text":"which was buying our largest competitor"},"1396":{"dur":1,"text":"called Zoomerang."},"1398":{"dur":2,"text":"And that was a huge thing"},"1400":{"dur":2,"text":"because we had to within\nnine month

that..."},"1431":{"dur":3,"text":"Besides that, I would say,\nthe biggest thing was,"},"1434":{"dur":4,"text":"we were really set on\nreplicating all of the features"},"1438":{"dur":2,"text":"that were on their platform,"},"1440":{"dur":1,"text":"because we wanted to make\nsure all of the customers"},"1442":{"dur":2,"text":"had a fantastic experience\nwhen they'd move

that sort of like base-building blocks."},"1803":{"dur":2,"text":"And then for us,\nobviously, the translation"},"1805":{"dur":2,"text":"is like base-building blocks."},"1808":{"dur":3,"text":"What we found is that\nvery much in product,"},"1811":{"dur":1,"text":"like once you're in the product,"},"1813":{"dur":1,"text":"you didn't need that much customization."},"1814":{"dur":4,"text":"Besides the basic things:\nstate format, all that stuff."},"1820":{"dur":2,"text":"But it was really about\nhow you were talking"},"1822":{"dur":3,"text":"about your product that\nneeded to be

so it's more about how you're talking"},"1842":{"dur":1,"text":"about your customers"},"1843":{"dur":2,"text":"and also how you're\nrepresenting in those pages."},"1845":{"dur":1,"text":"In Japan, as

make that?"},"1861":{"dur":1,"text":"For example, that Japan translation?"},"1863":{"dur":1,"text":"- So, in Japan we're\nactually doing only now."},"1865":{"dur":4,"text":"- Got it, that struck me

lessons"},"1885":{"dur":1,"text":"actually really helped to scale?"},"1887":{"dur":2,"text":"- So, I think it's again,\nit's, you kind of said it,"},"1890":{"dur":1,"text":"it's really watching the metrics"},"1892":{"dur":2,"text":"and understanding what people are doing"},"1894":{"dur":1,"text":"and so therefore you're\ntalking to them more"},"1896":{"dur":1,"text":"about what they're doing,"},"1897":{"dur":2,"text":"because your brand awareness\nin these markets is tiny."},"1900":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, the difference in\nthe US is we can say,

optimization"},"1936":{"dur":1,"text":"and search engine marketing per market,"},"1938":{"dur":2,"text":"and so you're starting to build\nup content pages per market."},"1940":{"dur":3,"text":"But it's obviously easier to\ndo that in English markets."},"1943":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, even, you know,"},"1947":{"dur":2,"text":"our business was almost all US"},"1950":{"dur":1,"text":"when we

that."},"1984":{"dur":2,"text":"SEO and SEM, that was important."},"1986":{"dur":1,"text":"What was some of the key lessons there?"},"1988":{"dur":1,"text":"By the way, LinkedIn, very similarly,"},"1990":{"dur":1,"text":"one of the things we realized was"},"1992":{"dur":1,"text":"that one of the things that members wanted"},"1993":{"dur":2,"text":"was a public profile page and so

another half"},"2002":{"dur":1,"text":"by which LinkedIn was discovered."},"2004":{"dur":1,"text":"Were there similar things?"},"2005":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yes, the most similar thing"},"2007":{"dur":2,"text":"is one of the big ways\nyou build link authority"},"2009":{"dur":2,"text":"is by having links all over the web."},"2012":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, SurveyMonkey has\nlinks all over the web."},"2014":{"dur":3,"text":"So our link authority was great in the US."},"2017":{"dur":2,"text":"So we needed to create localized domains"},"2020":{"dur":2,"text":"and, you know,

traffic"},"2092":{"dur":1,"text":"and start building out content pages"},"2094":{"dur":1,"text":"on those key words."},"2095":{"dur":1,"text":"And so we also did that"},"2096":{"dur":3,"text":"from a

student may not understand"},"2303":{"dur":1,"text":"why benchmarks are so important,"},"2305":{"dur":1,"text":"so say that too."},"2306":{"dur":4,"text":"- So, right now employee\nsatisfaction we have,"},"2311":{"dur":1,"text":"we have net promoter score,"},"2312":{"dur":2,"text":"which is how you might\ndo customer satisfaction,"},"2314":{"dur":3,"text":"we have a K-12 Parent-Education

data"},"2326":{"dur":1,"text":"that's statistically significant"},"2328":{"dur":2,"text":"or you can slice it and dice it by one."},"2331":{"dur":1,"text":"So if you think about classroom

impossible,"},"2557":{"dur":1,"text":"which is when you have to layer people"},"2558":{"dur":2,"text":"and then keeping them\nmotivated and excited,"},"2561":{"dur":1,"text":"because it's very hard

part that highlights"},"2660":{"dur":1,"text":"with Minna and specific is,"},"2661":{"dur":2,"text":"part of the arc that we have\nventured as you start with,"},"2664":{"dur":1,"text":"you're always hiring generalists,"},"2666":{"dur":1,"text":"but how you deploying them generally."},"2667":{"dur":3,"text":"Generalist early is doing everything,"},"2670":{"dur":3,"text":"then you're covering the

hold,"},"2693":{"dur":2,"text":"and this is how you play\nit and this is what you do."},"2696":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is how you come from a company"},"2697":{"dur":1,"text":"that hasn't thought about it"},"2699":{"dur":1,"text":"and move into a company that does,"},"2700":{"dur":1,"text":"which is precisely what she has been--"},"2702":{"dur":1,"text":"- And there will be some people,

people\nwho can scale and grow,"},"2716":{"dur":2,"text":"and there's those people who can't."},"2719":{"dur":1,"text":"And that is the hard thing,"},"2720":{"dur":1,"text":"because you obviously

product"},"2769":{"dur":2,"text":"specifically around\njust employee engagement"},"2772":{"dur":2,"text":"and they're going after\njust that HR space."},"2775":{"dur":2,"text":"So, you constantly see competition"},"2777":{"dur":2,"text":"when you're a large general platform."},"2780":{"dur":2,"text":"It's just a question of\nhow significant is it,"},"2782":{"dur":1,"text":"and how much is

you do any M&A"},"2791":{"dur":3,"text":"that wasn't actually within your space?"},"2794":{"dur":1,"text":"- We did like an adjacent, like Wufoo,"},"2796":{"dur":1,"text":"which was a forms-based

talent."},"2837":{"dur":1,"text":"- And how did you feel about,"},"2839":{"dur":2,"text":"you mentioned Google Forms,"},"2841":{"dur":2,"text":"how do the large players figure in,"},"2844":{"dur":3,"text":"whether it's Google or Microsoft or..?"},"2847":{"dur":2,"text":"Obviously, some of what you must do"},"2849":{"dur":2,"text":"is social graph optimization as well,"},"2851":{"dur":3,"text":"given Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn."},"2855":{"dur":3,"text":"- Yeah, I think that in\ngeneral it's a question"},"2858":{"dur":2,"text":"of where is the right\nplace to

companies"},"2875":{"dur":3,"text":"like no one's really heard of."},"2878":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, the really small ones."},"2880":{"dur":2,"text":"In general, it is a pretty small

company,"},"2925":{"dur":1,"text":"founders, executives, etc."},"2927":{"dur":2,"text":"That almost all comes\nfrom some version of that."},"2929":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's like, Oh, you know,\nDave

consider--"},"2939":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yeah, we're doing\nsomething slightly similar,"},"2941":{"dur":1,"text":"the kind of passion about surveys,"},"2943":{"dur":1,"text":"like the one I mentioned,"},"2944":{"dur":1,"text":"they were doing like phone polling."},"2945":{"dur":2,"text":"And we did another one which was"},"2948":{"dur":2,"text":"like somebody I had worked with in 1999,"},"2950":{"dur":1,"text":"like their company."},"2952":{"dur":1,"text":"As you start building your network,"},"2954":{"dur":1,"text":"you'll hear about, people will reach out"},"2955":{"dur":2,"text":"if they enjoyed working with you."},"2961":{"dur":3,"text":"Yeah, or you identifying it, I'm not sure."},"2968":{"dur":0,"text":"- [Voiceover] Speaking of that

[Reid] You mean acquihire is expensive?"},"2977":{"dur":3,"text":"(hum drowns out speaker)"},"2980":{"dur":2,"text":"- That is actually the\nusual benchmark for that,"},"2982":{"dur":1,"text":"which is a million per engineer."},"2984":{"dur":3,"text":"Actually in fact, it's\nexpensive if you said:"},"2987":{"dur":2,"text":"this is the only way I'm hiring."},"2990":{"dur":3,"text":"(hum drowns out speaker)"},"2994":{"dur":2,"text":"- Absolutely, but by the way,"},"2996":{"dur":1,"text":"it's not any five engineers,"},"2997":{"dur":1,"text":"it's the white five engineers."},"2999":{"dur":1,"text":"And part of what you're\nusually doing in that case,"},"3000":{"dur":2,"text":"that's five engineers who work\nreally, really well

pretty serious"},"3010":{"dur":1,"text":"in what you're doing."},"3011":{"dur":3,"text":"That is actually in fact\nworth of every single buck."},"3015":{"dur":2,"text":"- And remember, it's going

Almost always, minimum two years,"},"3030":{"dur":3,"text":"sometimes four."},"3033":{"dur":1,"text":"The whole question is,"},"3034":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean the alignment\nof incentives question,"},"3036":{"dur":3,"text":"when you get to compensation,"},"3039":{"dur":1,"text":"is actually extremely important"},"3041":{"dur":1,"text":"in circumstances like these."},"3042":{"dur":1,"text":"It's important all of the time,"},"3043":{"dur":1,"text":"but extremely important here."},"3044":{"dur":1,"text":"Did you have a question? Okay."},"3050":{"dur":5,"text":"(hum drowns out speaker)"},"3072":{"dur":1,"text":"- That's a great question."},"3074":{"dur":1,"text":"- And by the way, why\ndon't you restate it,"},"3075":{"dur":1,"text":"just to make sure we're going on."},"3077":{"dur":1,"text":"- So, the question was,"},"3078":{"dur":1,"text":"did SurveyMonkey have anything"},"3079":{"dur":2,"text":"to try to reduce bias in the questions."},"3081":{"dur":1,"text":"One of the most interesting\nthings you'll see"},"3083":{"dur":2,"text":"is if you actually ask people\nif they agree or disagree."},"3086":{"dur":2,"text":"In the US they're going to mostly agree."},"3089":{"dur":2,"text":"Just by nature Americans\nlike to agree with things."},"3091":{"dur":2,"text":"- [Reid] I disagree. (Selina laughs)"},"3095":{"dur":3,"text":"- But this research is also from Stanford."},"3098":{"dur":2,"text":"And actually the amount\nof that changes by market,"},"3101":{"dur":1,"text":"which is what really interesting."},"3103":{"dur":2,"text":"- Have you ever published\nwhat that percentage is?"},"3105":{"dur":2,"text":"- We have it on by-post,\nbut I don't remember right."},"3107":{"dur":2,"text":"- I guess I'll go find that bummer."},"3112":{"dur":1,"text":"- So what we did is we actually"},"3114":{"dur":1,"text":"built a couple things."},"3115":{"dur":1,"text":"One is we have this question bank"},"3117":{"dur":1,"text":"which helps you create,\nwrite the questions,"},"3118":{"dur":2,"text":"or use the questions that are worded"},"3121":{"dur":3,"text":"in the right way with\nthe right answer options."},"3124":{"dur":2,"text":"Because the difference in\nterms of how the answer options"},"3127":{"dur":2,"text":"are also worded, need\nto be equally spaced."},"3130":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we worked to make sure"},"3132":{"dur":1,"text":"that the questions themselves"},"3133":{"dur":1,"text":"kind of help reduce bias."},"3135":{"dur":2,"text":"The other thing is we have\nthe amount of functionality"},"3137":{"dur":1,"text":"so you can randomize."},"3138":{"dur":2,"text":"You can randomize options,\nyou can randomize things."},"3140":{"dur":1,"text":"So that you're actually not."},"3142":{"dur":3,"text":"Because people often choose\nthe first thing as well."},"3145":{"dur":2,"text":"But there's definitely\nthings that you can do"},"3147":{"dur":1,"text":"on a technological level."},"3149":{"dur":2,"text":"Also post the surveys or help people with"},"3152":{"dur":2,"text":"responding quality and survey quality,"},"3154":{"dur":1,"text":"like make sure that things are good."},"3156":{"dur":2,"text":"And we are making some\ninvestments there now."},"3163":{"dur":5,"text":"(hum drowns out speaker)"},"3177":{"dur":2,"text":"- So let me slightly\ngeneralize that question,"},"3179":{"dur":1,"text":"because it was covering different parts."},"3181":{"dur":2,"text":"What are the competitive barriers"},"3184":{"dur":2,"text":"to SurveyMonkey as it succeeds its scale,"},"3187":{"dur":1,"text":"isn't that reflects one of them"},"3188":{"dur":3,"text":"and if so, how so and\nwhat are the other ones?"},"3191":{"dur":2,"text":"- Great, so in terms of\njust in general, though,"},"3194":{"dur":3,"text":"one of the main competitive barriers"},"3197":{"dur":3,"text":"is going to be both your data."},"3201":{"dur":1,"text":"So if you've been using the product,"},"3202":{"dur":2,"text":"you start wanting to\nsee your data over time."},"3205":{"dur":2,"text":"And then the second is, as we build,"},"3207":{"dur":2,"text":"as we provide you the\ncomparative data sets"},"3210":{"dur":2,"text":"that also is a competitive differentiator"},"3213":{"dur":3,"text":"that most people don't have."},"3217":{"dur":2,"text":"But part of the reason why\nwe've done acquisitions"},"3219":{"dur":3,"text":"is because similar compannies..."},"3223":{"dur":2,"text":"Is because once you\nchoose a survey product"},"3225":{"dur":1,"text":"and your data starts going in there"},"3227":{"dur":2,"text":"and you have that data over time,"},"3230":{"dur":3,"text":"your willingness to move\nproducts is very low."},"3233":{"dur":2,"text":"So when people are churned\nout of SurveyMonkey,"},"3236":{"dur":2,"text":"the main thing they tell\nus why they've churned"},"3239":{"dur":2,"text":"is because they don't have\na need fro it right now"},"3241":{"dur":2,"text":"but I'm going to be back."},"3243":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, that is a huge\ncompetitive differentiator"},"3247":{"dur":3,"text":"that you actually have."},"3250":{"dur":2,"text":"But it is also, again, like I said,"},"3253":{"dur":1,"text":"it's the more you can do to provide"},"3254":{"dur":2,"text":"people insights of the\ndata the better you are,"},"3256":{"dur":2,"text":"whether it's the open-ended feedback."},"3259":{"dur":2,"text":"so trying to do natural\nlanguage processing."},"3261":{"dur":1,"text":"We have a basic text analysis today,"},"3263":{"dur":2,"text":"but that's another place\nthat we're investing."},"3265":{"dur":1,"text":"- Feel free to ponder on this question,"},"3267":{"dur":1,"text":"it was too sensitive,"},"3269":{"dur":1,"text":"but what have you found in particular"},"3271":{"dur":1,"text":"about the re-engagement?"},"3272":{"dur":2,"text":"So, how do you model the re-engagement,"},"3275":{"dur":1,"text":"to get the customer"},"3277":{"dur":2,"text":"who is apparently churned back in?"},"3279":{"dur":2,"text":"- So we spend a lot of\ntime of re-engagement"},"3282":{"dur":3,"text":"both through emailing the customer"},"3285":{"dur":1,"text":"and also through re-targeting"},"3287":{"dur":1,"text":"on both LinkedIn and Facebook."},"3288":{"dur":1,"text":"So, trying to find the\ncustomer where they are"},"3290":{"dur":1,"text":"and remind them that they should"},"3291":{"dur":2,"text":"re-engage to do feedback."},"3294":{"dur":2,"text":"So we have very specific\nre-engagement curves,"},"3296":{"dur":2,"text":"which we don't share."},"3299":{"dur":1,"text":"- That's what I figured,"},"3300":{"dur":1,"text":"because I realized that this would be"},"3302":{"dur":0,"text":"a very sensitive area,"},"3303":{"dur":1,"text":"which is the reason I framed it as,"},"3304":{"dur":1,"text":"only what you can say."},"3305":{"dur":3,"text":"- But it is a very significant\nportion of our business,"},"3309":{"dur":1,"text":"is getting people to essentially"},"3310":{"dur":1,"text":"come back and re-use you."},"3312":{"dur":2,"text":"So existing customers\nkind of paying you again."},"3314":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Reid] Do you use any\nmachine learning on that?"},"3316":{"dur":3,"text":"- We do use propensity model,"},"3319":{"dur":2,"text":"which is using, based on users' behavior,"},"3322":{"dur":3,"text":"which is looking at what\ntypes of surveys they've done"},"3325":{"dur":1,"text":"and using a bunch of variables"},"3327":{"dur":1,"text":"to decide when to re-contact them."},"3329":{"dur":3,"text":"And similarly with what\nwe should show them"},"3332":{"dur":1,"text":"at the end of he survey."},"3334":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Reid] Yep-yep, makes sense."},"3336":{"dur":1,"text":"Oh, question."},"3337":{"dur":4,"text":"(hum drowns out speaker)"},"3366":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, so for me there's three things--"},"3367":{"dur":1,"text":"- By the way, restate the question--"},"3368":{"dur":1,"text":"- Sorry, the question was..."},"3370":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, when I first heard Surveys"},"3371":{"dur":2,"text":"it didn't sound that interesting."},"3373":{"dur":1,"text":"But it was a scaled company,"},"3375":{"dur":1,"text":"that was one of the things\nthat attracted me to it."},"3377":{"dur":2,"text":"So, what are the important\nthings to think about?"},"3379":{"dur":2,"text":"For my mind, there's three\nimportant things to think about"},"3382":{"dur":2,"text":"when you're thinking about\nyour company, a company."},"3385":{"dur":1,"text":"Whether you're starting it from scratch"},"3386":{"dur":3,"text":"or you're going to a company."},"3389":{"dur":1,"text":"And the first is the product."},"3391":{"dur":2,"text":"So I said that when I first heard Surveys"},"3394":{"dur":1,"text":"I didn't think it was that interesting,"},"3395":{"dur":2,"text":"but what excited me was\nhow all of the people"},"3398":{"dur":1,"text":"were actually using the\ndata and listening to"},"3400":{"dur":2,"text":"whether it was their\ncustomers, their students,"},"3402":{"dur":2,"text":"their parents, their patients."},"3404":{"dur":2,"text":"Like the product is the\nmost important thing"},"3407":{"dur":1,"text":"in terms of you need to be excited about,"},"3408":{"dur":1,"text":"especially as an engineer\nyou're going to spend"},"3410":{"dur":3,"text":"all of your time\ndeveloping and building it."},"3413":{"dur":2,"text":"And that is very important to me."},"3415":{"dur":2,"text":"The second is always\ngoing to be the people."},"3418":{"dur":2,"text":"I mentioned Dave, I've\nmentioned him many times,"},"3420":{"dur":3,"text":"he was a fantastic leader,\nthe best mentor and manager"},"3424":{"dur":2,"text":"I've ever had in my career."},"3429":{"dur":2,"text":"But having people and then for me"},"3431":{"dur":2,"text":"it was also the opportunity\nto build my team."},"3433":{"dur":1,"text":"So I could choose the people I wanted"},"3435":{"dur":1,"text":"and help build that culture."},"3437":{"dur":1,"text":"That's always the second thing."},"3438":{"dur":3,"text":"And the third thing is what\nyou are going to learn there."},"3441":{"dur":2,"text":"And for me the part that\nI was going to learn"},"3444":{"dur":1,"text":"was could we actually take this company"},"3445":{"dur":4,"text":"that was at scale from a size-perspective,"},"3450":{"dur":1,"text":"so we get A\/B test and learn,"},"3451":{"dur":1,"text":"but the team was small,"},"3453":{"dur":2,"text":"and scale it up."},"3456":{"dur":1,"text":"And that was the part\nthat I hadn't done before,"},"3457":{"dur":1,"text":"that I was super excited about."},"3459":{"dur":2,"text":"I'd had this small company Evite"},"3462":{"dur":3,"text":"that we grew it to 30\npeople when we sold it."},"3466":{"dur":2,"text":"And I've been at Ticketmaster\nwhich was humongous."},"3468":{"dur":1,"text":"But actually taking that company"},"3470":{"dur":1,"text":"from that small size to large"},"3472":{"dur":1,"text":"was what I was super excited to learn."},"3473":{"dur":3,"text":"It's been six years and a\nfantastic learning experience."},"3478":{"dur":1,"text":"- The other thing I would add,"},"3479":{"dur":1,"text":"which I'm sure is part\nof the SurveryMonkey,"},"3481":{"dur":1,"text":"but if you begin to say,"},"3485":{"dur":4,"text":"so two critiques of Peter's statement,"},"3489":{"dur":2,"text":"one of them is essentially that"},"3491":{"dur":2,"text":"actually in fact software's

bits"},"3498":{"dur":1,"text":"actually means that you're also"},"3499":{"dur":1,"text":"getting a revolution in atoms."},"3500":{"dur":3,"text":"The second part of it is that,"},"3504":{"dur":2,"text":"in the 50's they were\nexpecting flying cars,"},"3506":{"dur":1,"text":"but they weren't expecting mobile phones."},"3508":{"dur":1,"text":"It's kind of is a way of

experience design\nleader, QA atomation,"},"3881":{"dur":1,"text":"obviously, the engineering leader,"},"3883":{"dur":2,"text":"and then, an BI analyst,\nwho's actually

teams that are\nworking on different services,"},"3903":{"dur":1,"text":"or different parts of the app."},"3905":{"dur":2,"text":"And then there's standardization of

important"},"3914":{"dur":1,"text":"as you start wanting to add new features"},"3916":{"dur":2,"text":"or new products on top"},"3918":{"dur":3,"text":"is that figuring out\nwhat are the guard

standards."},"3938":{"dur":3,"text":"But we didn't give a basic"},"3941":{"dur":1,"text":"that you had to..."},"3944":{"dur":2,"text":"We wanted you to release\nat least once a week."},"3949":{"dur":2,"text":"But you can release more if you wanted to."},"3952":{"dur":2,"text":"But basically, the thought-process was,"},"3954":{"dur":1,"text":"I didn't actually care if people wanted"},"3955":{"dur":1,"text":"to do three weeks sprints\nor two weeks sprints,"},"3957":{"dur":1,"text":"or they wanted to do kind of"},"3959":{"dur":2,"text":"semi-waterfall or agile or

of"},"3990":{"dur":1,"text":"they're product or QA or whatever."},"3992":{"dur":2,"text":"They'll more identify as a gorilla,"},"3994":{"dur":3,"text":"which is our analyze team\nversus like I'm an engineer."},"3997":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think that that's actually good."},"4001":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Voiceover] So it\nseems like SurveyMonkey"},"4003":{"dur":1,"text":"is pretty similar to EventPro in terms of"},"4004":{"dur":2,"text":"it's a product for organizers to then"},"4007":{"dur":1,"text":"distribute their own way."},"4009":{"dur":1,"text":"How do you guys think about"},"4010":{"dur":1,"text":"product development given that"},"4011":{"dur":3,"text":"there's two sorts of like"},"4015":{"dur":3,"text":"user bases creators and the respondents?"},"4018":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yeah, so again, whenever you're thinking"},"4021":{"dur":1,"text":"about EventPro as the same,"},"4023":{"dur":1,"text":"which is whenever you're\nthinking about the fact"},"4025":{"dur":2,"text":"that that respondent\nmight become your creator,"},"4027":{"dur":2,"text":"like you have to make sure\nthat the respondent experience"},"4030":{"dur":2,"text":"is just like fantastic,"},"4032":{"dur":1,"text":"they can take the survey really well,"},"4034":{"dur":1,"text":"that's optimized for mobile,"},"4035":{"dur":2,"text":"that then when they lend, when they finish"},"4037":{"dur":1,"text":"is a good experience."},"4039":{"dur":1,"text":"But if you think about..."},"4040":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's 80% of our traffic\nis on the taking side."},"4044":{"dur":1,"text":"But obviously our customer,\nthe one who's paying us,"},"4046":{"dur":2,"text":"the one who's putting their faith in us"},"4049":{"dur":1,"text":"to actually send their survey out"},"4051":{"dur":1,"text":"to the customers as the creator."},"4052":{"dur":2,"text":"So in terms of from the\nresourcing perspective"},"4054":{"dur":1,"text":"we spend most of our resources"},"4056":{"dur":2,"text":"on the survey creation side,"},"4059":{"dur":2,"text":"because you need to get that person"},"4061":{"dur":2,"text":"through the hurdle of\nhaving the confidence"},"4064":{"dur":1,"text":"to like put their name out there"},"4065":{"dur":2,"text":"with a bunch of questions\nto a bunch of other people."},"4067":{"dur":4,"text":"And that is the customer who essentially"},"4072":{"dur":1,"text":"in the end we're trying to upgrade"},"4074":{"dur":1,"text":"to get into a paying customer base."},"4075":{"dur":3,"text":"But you have to balance your resources,"},"4079":{"dur":2,"text":"but you have to think about"},"4081":{"dur":3,"text":"where that entry and starting\npoint is of that live cycle."},"4084":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Voiceover] Do you guys\nspend a lot of effort"},"4086":{"dur":3,"text":"on getting the respondents\nto become part of like,"},"4089":{"dur":1,"text":"not just like the ecosystem,"},"4090":{"dur":2,"text":"but also take other people's\nsurveys or your own?"},"4093":{"dur":3,"text":"- So when we launched the panel business,"},"4096":{"dur":2,"text":"then you have the ability\nto sign up to take surveys"},"4098":{"dur":3,"text":"and every time you take a survey\nyou get 50 cents to charity"},"4102":{"dur":4,"text":"and then a creator can buy respondents."},"4106":{"dur":1,"text":"So that was a new business"},"4108":{"dur":1,"text":"that we launched in 2013,"},"4110":{"dur":1,"text":"using kind of leveraging the fact"},"4111":{"dur":1,"text":"that we have all these users"},"4113":{"dur":1,"text":"who want to not only necessarily"},"4115":{"dur":1,"text":"send surveys to people they know,"},"4116":{"dur":1,"text":"but to potential customers,"},"4117":{"dur":3,"text":"to do brand research or market research."},"4121":{"dur":1,"text":"And so we leverage the fact that we have"},"4122":{"dur":3,"text":"kind of this large traffic\nto build out this panel."},"4126":{"dur":3,"text":"And we decided to do 50\ncents for charity of choice"},"4130":{"dur":2,"text":"versus money because\nwe wanted to make sure"},"4132":{"dur":2,"text":"people weren't BSing it,"},"4135":{"dur":1,"text":"like we wanted to make sure"},"4136":{"dur":2,"text":"people were answering and\nto make sure that answering"},"4138":{"dur":1,"text":"was very high quality."},"4140":{"dur":2,"text":"It was really important that, you know,"},"4142":{"dur":1,"text":"no one's going to like to BS a survey"},"4144":{"dur":1,"text":"to give 50 cents to, you know,"},"4145":{"dur":2,"text":"the Teach For America,"},"4148":{"dur":2,"text":"so that's why we built it out that

question."},"4171":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Reid] And, repeat it."},"4173":{"dur":1,"text":"- Oh, sorry, the question was is that,"},"4174":{"dur":1,"text":"you know as a manager"},"4176":{"dur":1,"text":"you're trying to figure out"},"4177":{"dur":2,"text":"who can essentially scale and grow,"},"4180":{"dur":1,"text":"but as a person in the\nchair, how do I make sure"},"4182":{"dur":3,"text":"that I'm scaling and growing?"},"4187":{"dur":4,"text":"I would say, again, a\nlot of it is, you know,"},"4191":{"dur":3,"text":"is figuring out if you're actually

you can either scale\nthrough a tech track way"},"4214":{"dur":3,"text":"and scaling the tech\ntrack way and growing that"},"4219":{"dur":1,"text":"is about gaining knowledge,\ntaking more ownership"},"4221":{"dur":3,"text":"of more services, showing mentoring"},"4224":{"dur":2,"text":"other people on the team,"},"4227":{"dur":1,"text":"and kind of being able"},"4229":{"dur":1,"text":"to take tech leadership."},"4230":{"dur":1,"text":"But then there is also the\npeople management track."},"4232":{"dur":1,"text":"And you have to really decide"},"4233":{"dur":1,"text":"if it's something that you enjoy."},"4235":{"dur":0,"text":"But if you're in that role,"},"4236":{"dur":2,"text":"like you've brought somebody in to

so\nsatisfying to like coding"},"4263":{"dur":2,"text":"and pushing it to production\nand having it work."},"4266":{"dur":1,"text":"Like you have to feel satisfaction"},"4267":{"dur":2,"text":"over influencing other people."},"4270":{"dur":2,"text":"And so part of it is like making sure"},"4273":{"dur":1,"text":"that that's something you're excited about"},"4274":{"dur":1,"text":"and being a

you're working on."},"4290":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, like that's not\nenjoyable to everybody."},"4293":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think that that\nalso becomes a question,"},"4295":{"dur":1,"text":"is also starting to be\nhonest with yourself"},"4297":{"dur":1,"text":"of like what you enjoy."},"4299":{"dur":1,"text":"And then depending upon that,"},"4301":{"dur":1,"text":"like working on those

there?"},"4726":{"dur":1,"text":"- So, the question was,"},"4728":{"dur":2,"text":"given that we moved the\nteam from two to 150,"},"4731":{"dur":2,"text":"what were some of the\norganizational strategies"},"4733":{"dur":1,"text":"we used to scale, basically?"},"4735":{"dur":2,"text":"- [Voiceover] That were\nvery high leverage,"},"4737":{"dur":1,"text":"so something that took minimal

do"},"4783":{"dur":1,"text":"is that we always liked to have,"},"4784":{"dur":1,"text":"the re has to be some cadence"},"4786":{"dur":1,"text":"that everybody's agreeing to"},"4788":{"dur":1,"text":"that the business should operate."},"4789":{"dur":2,"text":"In our case, we decided on quarterly."},"4791":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, every quarter there was"},"4794":{"dur":1,"text":"what are we going to\nget done this quarter?"},"4795":{"dur":2,"text":"And no matter whether we\nwere two people or 150 people"},"4798":{"dur":2,"text":"we still keep that cadence\nwhere everybody says"},"4801":{"dur":2,"text":"this is what we're going\nto get done in the quarter."},"4803":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think that starting to build"},"4804":{"dur":1,"text":"that in from the beginning"},"4806":{"dur":1,"text":"is actually pretty important"},"4807":{"dur":2,"text":"because then people get used to that"},"4809":{"dur":1,"text":"sort of rhythm of the business"},"4811":{"dur":2,"text":"and that helps the organization sort of"},"4813":{"dur":2,"text":"know what to expect in some time period."},"4816":{"dur":1,"text":"What you can do goes from this to this,"},"4818":{"dur":2,"text":"but it's still the fact that\nyour communication is..."},"4820":{"dur":3,"text":"So every quarter I get\nthe entire team together"},"4823":{"dur":3,"text":"and we quickly go through key\nthings we did last quarter"},"4826":{"dur":2,"text":"and like great things coming up."},"4829":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Reid] I'm going to\nask the last question."},"4831":{"dur":3,"text":"Overtime, but I think\nit's still worth asking."},"4836":{"dur":2,"text":"You have a phone line to call

so,"},"4854":{"dur":2,"text":"what wold I tell myself to do differently?"},"4859":{"dur":2,"text":"So I would say, this is\na very technical thing,"},"4862":{"dur":2,"text":"I would say the biggest thing\nwe didn't do fast enough"},"4864":{"dur":4,"text":"was improve our deployment systems."},"4868":{"dur":2,"text":"And I survey my team every single quarter,"},"4871":{"dur":3,"text":"and as a

that"},"4880":{"dur":3,"text":"like for us to get our code from keyboard"},"4883":{"dur":2,"text":"to production was just too long."},"4885":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, we should have just
