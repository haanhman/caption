now."},"2334":{"dur":1,"text":"This is called a nasal spray"},"2336":{"dur":2,"text":"and you just kind of rig it together"},"2338":{"dur":1,"text":"and then you can squirt the medication"},"2340":{"dur":1,"text":"up into a nostril."},"2343":{"dur":3,"text":"And then there's also,\nthis one here is just"},"2347":{"dur":2,"text":"a nasal mist so unlike the\nones you would get

call 911."},"2434":{"dur":2,"text":"It only lasts, like I\nsaid, for 30 to 90 minutes"},"2437":{"dur":1,"text":"so you wanna make sure\nyou stay with that person"},"2439":{"dur":1,"text":"after you call them."},"2440":{"dur":2,"text":"Make sure they don't go\nback into an overdose."},"2442":{"dur":1,"text":"If that happens, you wanna\nmake sure you administer"},"2444":{"dur":1,"text":"Naloxone

that\nhelp is on the way."},"2459":{"dur":2,"text":"And then A is administer rescue breathing,"},"2462":{"dur":2,"text":"so you wanna do two rescue breaths"},"2464":{"dur":2,"text":"followed by one breath every five seconds"},"2466":{"dur":1,"text":"just to make sure they're breathing."},"2468":{"dur":2,"text":"And then you can go ahead\nand administer Naloxone."},"2471":{"dur":1,"text":"If that does not work, you wanna resume"},"2473":{"dur":1,"text":"your rescue breathing."},"2474":{"dur":4,"text":"And then E would be for ensure\nsafety until EMS arrives."},"2482":{"dur":1,"text":"We wanted to talk a little\nbit about the expanding"},"2484":{"dur":1,"text":"Naloxone in Iowa."},"2486":{"dur":4,"text":"So a couple bills have, or a\nbill has recently been

just passed the\nstanding order for the pharmacy"},"2508":{"dur":1,"text":"so like a flu shot,"},"2509":{"dur":1,"text":"you could go to the pharmacy"},"2511":{"dur":4,"text":"and obtain some Naloxone if the pharmacist"},"2515":{"dur":1,"text":"finds it deemable that you need it."},"2517":{"dur":1,"text":"So either if you find yourself at risk"},"2518":{"dur":1,"text":"for an opioid

.2% are from public service providers."},"2588":{"dur":2,"text":"And then we just want to talk\nabout a couple other ways"},"2590":{"dur":3,"text":"that you could hopefully\nprevent this

the generics versus\nthe brand name medications"},"3899":{"dur":1,"text":"are the same."},"3900":{"dur":3,"text":"So, some people may\nexperience different effects"},"3904":{"dur":2,"text":"from
