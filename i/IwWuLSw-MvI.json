life."},"17":{"dur":3,"text":"It was Lisa Clements on the phone."},"21":{"dur":5,"text":"My Department of Correction Director\nhad been murdered in his own home."},"26":{"dur":2,"text":"Why do I start by\ntalking to you about Tom?"},"29":{"dur":4,"text":"I start because Tom probably taught me\nmore about civic engagement"},"33":{"dur":3,"text":"than any person\nI've ever worked with in my life."},"37":{"dur":3,"text":"My first meeting with Tom\nwas about budget cuts in Colorado,"},"41":{"dur":4,"text":"and the need to engage the people\nof Colorado in prison closures,"},"45":{"dur":5,"text":"and he said, \"Rox, we're going to\nhave to go shut down a community."},"50":{"dur":4,"text":"We're closing a prison\nwhere we're the sole employer,"},"55":{"dur":2,"text":"and we have to go tell them.\""},"58":{"dur":4,"text":"So we got in the car\nand went to Las Animas, Colorado,"},"62":{"dur":2,"text":"and we met with the community."},"65":{"dur":2,"text":"People yelled at us,\nand they screamed at us."},"67":{"dur":5,"text":"They were terrified, and we escorted out\nwith security at the end of the meeting."},"73":{"dur":2,"text":"Tom's death had nothing\nto do with that night,"},"76":{"dur":4,"text":"but it has everything to do\nwith how we think about good government."},"81":{"dur":3,"text":"We met with that community\nevery two weeks,"},"85":{"dur":3,"text":"and three weeks ago we announced\nthat we were bringing in new employers,"},"88":{"dur":3,"text":"that we had transformed\nan old prison facility"},"92":{"dur":4,"text":"into a rehabilitation place\nfor people who are homeless."},"96":{"dur":3,"text":"The community will once again have jobs"},"99":{"dur":4,"text":"and will once again have\nthe opportunity to thrive."},"104":{"dur":1,"text":"(Applause)"},"107":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you."},"109":{"dur":4,"text":"But in the car,\nTom and I talked a lot about democracy,"},"113":{"dur":3,"text":"and open and public dialogue,\nand why did we have to close a prison"},"117":{"dur":3,"text":"in order to get people\nto come out and talk to us?"},"121":{"dur":3,"text":"Why is it that free speech\nand open elections"},"124":{"dur":3,"text":"don't seem to be valued\nanymore in America?"},"127":{"dur":5,"text":"And at the same time, across the world,\nwe are losing democracy."},"133":{"dur":7,"text":"Why is it that trust in government\nhas decreased from 60% just ten years ago"},"140":{"dur":3,"text":"to less than 19% now?"},"144":{"dur":3,"text":"What were we going to do about it\nas a community,"},"147":{"dur":3,"text":"and what were we going to do\nabout it as taxpayers?"},"150":{"dur":4,"text":"Tom and I were people who never wanted\nto be in political appointment roles."},"155":{"dur":2,"text":"We were people who just wanted\nto improve government,"},"157":{"dur":2,"text":"so we started the conversation:"},"160":{"dur":3,"text":"what do you do to re-establish trust,"},"163":{"dur":5,"text":"and how is it that every one of us\nas taxpayers participate in that process?"},"169":{"dur":1,"text":"We believe that first and foremost,"},"171":{"dur":6,"text":"taxpayers have to be seen\nnot as taxpayers but as customers."},"177":{"dur":3,"text":"Transparency in government\nhas to become more relevant,"},"181":{"dur":5,"text":"and not be, as one of the earlier speaker\nreferred to it as vomit, but as real data."},"186":{"dur":3,"text":"There has to be fiscal accountability."},"189":{"dur":2,"text":"There have to be great leaders\nin government."},"192":{"dur":4,"text":"When government does all of that,\nit still not going to be trusted,"},"197":{"dur":5,"text":"unless we as citizens, we as customers,\nbecome more active."},"203":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's talk about what it means\nto be seen as customers."},"207":{"dur":5,"text":"It means that customers, you and I,\nare entitled to results."},"213":{"dur":6,"text":"Our public employees must be treated\nwith respect but so must we, as customers."},"220":{"dur":5,"text":"Bureaucrats should be evaluated\nbased on how customers are treated."},"226":{"dur":2,"text":"There has to be transparency\nin government,"},"229":{"dur":4,"text":"and we have to take the time as citizens\nto learn about our government functions."},"233":{"dur":2,"text":"In Colorado, we are fortunate."},"235":{"dur":2,"text":"We have\nthe Colorado Information Marketplace"},"238":{"dur":3,"text":"and every single strategic plan\nfor every single department"},"241":{"dur":2,"text":"is published online."},"243":{"dur":4,"text":"There's no excuses for us\nnot to know what our government is doing,"},"247":{"dur":2,"text":"or why they're doing something."},"250":{"dur":3,"text":"But we also have a responsibility\nas taxpayers to understand"},"253":{"dur":3,"text":"exactly where our money is going,\nwho is getting it,"},"256":{"dur":1,"text":"where it is being used?"},"258":{"dur":3,"text":"We must take the time to learn about it."},"262":{"dur":4,"text":"It is easy to step back and say,\n\"I'm done with government.\""},"266":{"dur":2,"text":"We can't afford to do that."},"268":{"dur":3,"text":"We see other countries in the world\nwhere that is happening,"},"272":{"dur":3,"text":"and it is not the right future\nfor America."},"276":{"dur":3,"text":"We recently worked hard\nto write a book called, \"Leadocracy,\""},"279":{"dur":3,"text":"that is to encourage\nevery single person that is in this room"},"283":{"dur":3,"text":"to think about\nat some point in your career,"},"287":{"dur":4,"text":"not just complaining about government,\nbut stepping up,"},"291":{"dur":3,"text":"doing a stent in government,\nbeing a great leader"},"295":{"dur":4,"text":"who knows how to analyze,\nallocate, and align resources."},"299":{"dur":2,"text":"Figuring out what outcomes\nwe want in government,"},"302":{"dur":3,"text":"and actually stepping forward\nand working on it;"},"305":{"dur":3,"text":"figuring out\nhow our government taxes work,"},"308":{"dur":2,"text":"when we should be asking for\na tax increase,"},"311":{"dur":3,"text":"and how we are moving results forward."},"314":{"dur":5,"text":"And results that aren't about\npolitical affiliation, or about a hammer,"},"319":{"dur":2,"text":"but results that are about\ninfluencing people"},"322":{"dur":3,"text":"to behave in a way\nthat really makes sense."},"325":{"dur":3,"text":"In government, we also have to have\na sense of urgency,"},"329":{"dur":4,"text":"and we as customers have the right\nto demand that sense of urgency."},"333":{"dur":1,"text":"Oftentimes we get told,"},"335":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Well, that will take five years to do,\nthat'll take ten years to do.\""},"339":{"dur":4,"text":"We as customers have the right\nto demand a sense of urgency."},"343":{"dur":5,"text":"We also have the right to demand\nthat our leaders lean into conflict."},"349":{"dur":3,"text":"What I mean by that is that our leaders\nhave to do what Tom and I did"},"353":{"dur":4,"text":"that night in Las Animas:\ngo and listen to people."},"357":{"dur":2,"text":"Have the hard conversations."},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"It's easy to talk to the people\nthat agree with us;"},"363":{"dur":4,"text":"it's hard to lean into conflict\nand hear from other people."},"367":{"dur":4,"text":"I believe that if government\ntakes that side of the responsibility,"},"371":{"dur":3,"text":"then we as citizens have to take\nthe other side of the responsibility"},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"and truly become active in government."},"377":{"dur":4,"text":"We can't sit back and have less than half\nof the people in the United States voting."},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"I remember, as a young child,\nI was seven years

got to the post office,\nand we were stopped at the door,"},"403":{"dur":3,"text":"and we were told\nthat we couldn't get the mail."},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"We rode home on our bikes,\nwe went into the house,"},"409":{"dur":4,"text":"and said to our mom\nthey wouldn't let us get the mail today."},"413":{"dur":5,"text":"My mom said, \"Girls, sit down,\nyou're about to learn a lesson.\""},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"My mother called\nthe U.S. Postmaster General,"},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"and then she called our U.S. Senators,"},"424":{"dur":4,"text":"and the next day we were all
