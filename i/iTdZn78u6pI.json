sense."},"205":{"dur":3,"text":"All three of them\nare repositories of culture."},"208":{"dur":2,"text":"They all have very specific locations."},"211":{"dur":3,"text":"They all have inspiration\nand knowledge that we're seeking."},"216":{"dur":3,"text":"They represent the richness\nof our culture intellectually,"},"219":{"dur":1,"text":"spiritually, and creatively."},"221":{"dur":3,"text":"But for an awful lot of people,\nthey are places of boredom"},"226":{"dur":3,"text":"and stillness and quiet, right?"},"229":{"dur":1,"text":"We all know the rules."},"231":{"dur":1,"text":"No

repositories"},"257":{"dur":3,"text":"of culture that are descended\nfrom kings and queens."},"260":{"dur":3,"text":"They are housed in these\nintellectual spaces"},"264":{"dur":2,"text":"and in these incredible\narchitectural buildings."},"267":{"dur":3,"text":"They represent experiences\nthat most of us can only dream of."},"271":{"dur":4,"text":"They are representative\nof the power of community"},"276":{"dur":1,"text":"and of countries even."},"278":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's no wonder to me\nthat a lot of people find museums"},"281":{"dur":4,"text":"to be boring and elitist\nand perhaps even unnecessary."},"285":{"dur":3,"text":"But I'm here to argue that art museums\ncannot exist without you"},"289":{"dur":1,"text":"in their current iteration."},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"And I would say that\nbecause we live in a world"},"293":{"dur":2,"text":"where people are driven\nto seek new experiences,"},"296":{"dur":3,"text":"to find out new information,\nand to connect with one another,"},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"that you cannot exist without art museums."},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, the National Endowment for the Arts"},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"came out with a study a few years ago."},"309":{"dur":4,"text":"And it basically said\nthat participation in the arts"},"313":{"dur":2,"text":"is down dramatically\nover the last twenty years,"},"316":{"dur":1,"text":"whether it's ballets"},"317":{"dur":2,"text":"or orchestra concerts or exhibitions."},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"People are not walking\nand getting their behinds in seats"},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"and they're not walking\nthrough the galleries."},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"And on one hand that's really distressing."},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"But on the other hand,\nwe kind of know why."},"329":{"dur":1,"text":"There are people who have said"},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"that even though they\naren't going to these kinds"},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"of cultural things\nthey would otherwise like to go"},"336":{"dur":1,"text":"and they gave three big reasons."},"338":{"dur":1,"text":"And the first one is time."},"340":{"dur":3,"text":"We don't have enough time\nto do the things that we need to do"},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"much less the things that we want to do."},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"And there are some people\nthat even more it's difficult"},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"for them to find\nthe transportation to get there"},"351":{"dur":1,"text":"or find a way to get there."},"353":{"dur":2,"text":"A second thing - and if you have\nyoung kids you know"},"356":{"dur":1,"text":"what I'm talking about."},"357":{"dur":4,"text":"If you have kids under the age of six,\nit is very difficult"},"361":{"dur":3,"text":"for you to find the time\nto get your kids, get them ready,"},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"put them in the car,\nschlep them over there,"},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"and then once you get there\nthere's nothing for them to do."},"370":{"dur":2,"text":"And I know that as a parent\nI am not going to go through that"},"373":{"dur":3,"text":"because I don't want to hear\nthe whining once we get there, right?"},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"And the third reason that people\nare who would otherwise"},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"want to engage with culture,\nthe reason that they're not"},"383":{"dur":3,"text":"is because of social experiences\nand the lack thereof."},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"And for me this\nis the most poignant reason."},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"They don't want to go\nto these things alone."},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"Even in situations where\nmoney is a difficulty,"},"396":{"dur":1,"text":"that's something that can be overcome."},"398":{"dur":3,"text":"But the social part\nof not being with anybody"},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"is not something people want to overcome."},"404":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm not going to do that yet."},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay so the National Endowment\nfor the Arts"},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"also had another study that came out,"},"411":{"dur":1,"text":"so this is really paradoxical."},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"They actually said that people\nare engaging with culture just"},"417":{"dur":1,"text":"as much as they did before."},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"And I know you're probably\nsitting there thinking"},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Dana you just told me\nthat people aren't going"},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"to art museums, so what's up?\""},"425":{"dur":1,"text":"And what's up is technology."},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"People are interfacing with technology."},"429":{"dur":1,"text":"They are downloading podcasts."},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"They are watching videos of concerts."},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"They are pulling up Google Art."},"436":{"dur":2,"text":"They are looking at exhibitions online."},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"And they are engaging\nwith culture in a way"},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"that makes the most sense\nto them in terms of time,"},"442":{"dur":3,"text":"in terms of space, in terms of safety,\nand in terms of cost."},"446":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, I think that the problem with this"},"451":{"dur":3,"text":"is that it doesn't give people\nthe kind of experience"},"454":{"dur":5,"text":"that you can get if you go\nto a rich, social, interesting place."},"461":{"dur":4,"text":"There is no replacement\nfor actually going to a space"},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"and being with other people\nand having a relationship with them"},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"and the discussions that can happen."},"472":{"dur":3,"text":"Art museums occupy\na rich space in our culture"},"476":{"dur":1,"text":"and there's a reason for that."},"477":{"dur":1,"text":"You can go there and you can see things"},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"that you've never seen before."},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"You can learn about times\nand places and other people"},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"that are otherwise unimaginable."},"487":{"dur":1,"text":"Museums inspire us."},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"They help us to think\nand they help us to consider our place"},"491":{"dur":1,"text":"in the world, in a world"},"492":{"dur":3,"text":"that I would argue right\nnow needs a lot of that."},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"However, you have to go."},"500":{"dur":3,"text":"You have to be there\nin order to experience this."},"504":{"dur":3,"text":"The NEA study that I initially\ntold you about actually said"},"508":{"dur":3,"text":"that the main reason people go\nto museums is because they want"},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"to spend time with friends\nand family and they want"},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"to learn something new\nbut you can't do it unless you go."},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"Right now you can look up\nanything you want online."},"522":{"dur":3,"text":"There is no shortage\nof the information that you can find"},"526":{"dur":4,"text":"on artists and paintings\nand sculptures and exhibitions."},"531":{"dur":3,"text":"But you can't experience it\nunless you are there physically"},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"in person."},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"I want to make sure that everybody knows"},"538":{"dur":1,"text":"that I'm not a luddite."},"539":{"dur":3,"text":"I am just as addicted to my iPhone\nas everybody else in this room -"},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"and I know some of you in this room, \nso you know what I'm talking about."},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"And I really think\nthat there are some amazing things"},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"that museums are doing\nwith technology right now in terms"},"552":{"dur":1,"text":"of educational engagement."},"553":{"dur":0,"text":"It's working."},"554":{"dur":4,"text":"However, I want you to go back\nto your original

include"},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"interfacing with a screen."},"572":{"dur":3,"text":"Right now, art museums\nare doing a million different things"},"576":{"dur":4,"text":"to bring you in, whether it's K-12 tours"},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"or university experiences,"},"583":{"dur":3,"text":"whether it's musical performances\nor poetry readings."},"587":{"dur":3,"text":"Sometimes we have little
