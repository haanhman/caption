you sign up, you can\nfind friends by module code,"},"116":{"dur":2,"text":"see who else is on Open\nTree with your module."},"118":{"dur":2,"text":"So you make friends that way."},"120":{"dur":1,"text":"You can also search."},"122":{"dur":2,"text":"If you search for library,\nall of the library staff"},"124":{"dur":1,"text":"have library in their

their modules"},"151":{"dur":1,"text":"or their discipline\nareas to sort of see"},"153":{"dur":1,"text":"I guess what's hot right now\nin terms of stuff that's being"},"155":{"dur":0,"text":"HELEN CLOUGH: Exactly."},"156":{"dur":2,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: What sorts\nof things could you find?"},"158":{"dur":2,"text":"HELEN CLOUGH: Well, so it's\nall of the online library"},"161":{"dur":2,"text":"So the e-books, the e-journals,\nall of the academic content,"},"164":{"dur":1,"text":"but also library web pages."},"166":{"dur":4,"text":"So for example, I wrote a\nreview of a page that tells you"},"170":{"dur":3,"text":"how you set up Google Scholar so\nthat it links with the library."},"174":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Oh, I\nwant to look that up."},"175":{"dur":1,"text":"HELEN CLOUGH: So I\ngrabbed that page."},"177":{"dur":1,"text":"And I quickly highlighted it."},"178":{"dur":2,"text":"And I wrote a review, and I\nsaid this is really useful."},"180":{"dur":1,"text":"If you're going to be\nusing Google Scholar,"},"182":{"dur":2,"text":"then have a look at\nthese instructions"},"184":{"dur":2,"text":"on how you set it up."},"187":{"dur":1,"text":"So yes, it's about\nmaking friends."},"189":{"dur":4,"text":"It's about identifying resources\nthat other students have"},"193":{"dur":1,"text":"highlighted or\nwritten reviews of."},"195":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's a game."},"196":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's building\nyour tree, making"},"198":{"dur":1,"text":"sure you get all the\nlights on your tree."},"199":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: So what do\nthe colours mean, then,"},"201":{"dur":1,"text":"in terms of the tree?"},"202":{"dur":1,"text":"Is it just pretty\nand decorative?"},"203":{"dur":1,"text":"HELEN CLOUGH: It's just\npretty and decorative,

Google Scholar,"},"215":{"dur":0,"text":"for example."},"216":{"dur":1,"text":"So you don't have to\ncut and paste things"},"217":{"dur":2,"text":"back into the library\nsuch to get them for free."},"219":{"dur":1,"text":"Those sorts of things\nwill be really useful."},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"And I guess you do get some\npeople who are very pro-"},"223":{"dur":0,"text":"that sort of thing."},"224":{"dur":1,"text":"So they're good to\nbe friends with."},"226":{"dur":1,"text":"HELEN CLOUGH: Yes,\nexactly, yeah."},"227":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's the whole\nidea of

community building"},"237":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's also making a game\nof it and building your tree."},"240":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Excellent."},"241":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, Helen Clough, thank you\nso much for coming and showing"},"243":{"dur":0,"text":"us that."},"244":{"dur":1,"text":"That looks really, really fun."},"245":{"dur":2,"text":"And we'll put a link\nfor that on the

me and Robert were talking\nabout how the first mission was"},"275":{"dur":0,"text":"getting cakes."},"276":{"dur":1,"text":"And the second one\nhas been biscuits."},"278":{"dur":2,"text":"So this one has been\nvery successful."},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"So this should last us\nabout a few minutes."},"282":{"dur":1,"text":"SOPHIE: I hope so."},"284":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: But what\none of the things"},"286":{"dur":1,"text":"we were talking about\nfrom the library"},"288":{"dur":3,"text":"is that they let you have\nthe SCONUL access scheme."},"291":{"dur":1,"text":"That lets you use\nthe library near you"},"293":{"dur":2,"text":"and use the study\nspaces and borrow books."},"295":{"dur":1,"text":"So we're very pleased\nto know about that."},"297":{"dur":1,"text":"SOPHIE: I didn't actually\nknow about that until now."},"298":{"dur":1,"text":"And I've been studying\nfor four years, so."},"300":{"dur":0,"text":"HJ: There you go."},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"We even learn lots of\nstuff sitting here."},"303":{"dur":3,"text":"Yes, so yeah, I think\nwe're ready to go"},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"with lunch and yeah."},"309":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY:\nBrilliant,

different."},"324":{"dur":2,"text":"And you wanted to talk\nabout creative industries."},"326":{"dur":1,"text":"And we've got some\nwidgets that we're"},"328":{"dur":1,"text":"going to show now\nduring the duration"},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"of the next few minutes\nof this new section."},"332":{"dur":1,"text":"We'd like to know a\nbit about whether you'd"},"334":{"dur":1,"text":"like to be interested\nin studying"},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"the creative industries,\nwhat sorts of things"},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"you're interested in,\npostgraduate, undergraduates."},"340":{"dur":1,"text":"List up to three that\nyou'd be interested"},"342":{"dur":3,"text":"in, and some of the categories\nthat you think apply to you."},"345":{"dur":1,"text":"So we're going to put\nthose up there now."},"347":{"dur":1,"text":"And we'd like you\nto vote on them."},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"But we need to explain a\nbit about the context of all"},"351":{"dur":1,"text":"So what are you doing?"},"353":{"dur":3,"text":"ALISON GREEN: Well, one of the\nmost interesting opportunities"},"357":{"dur":1,"text":"for me at the\nmoment, I think, is"},"358":{"dur":1,"text":"looking at what new\ndevelopments we can come up"},"360":{"dur":1,"text":"with for our curriculum."},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"And so the one that's really\ncaptured my imagination and I'm"},"364":{"dur":1,"text":"really interested to\nfind if it catches"},"366":{"dur":1,"text":"our students'\nimagination too, it's"},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"around creative industries."},"370":{"dur":2,"text":"So the creative industries are\nbooming, which is fantastic."},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"We've seen a huge\nincrease in the number"},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"of jobs in creative industries,\nsomewhere around 1.9"},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"million jobs."},"378":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's an increase of\n20% in the last five years."},"381":{"dur":1,"text":"So there's a great\nopportunity there,"},"382":{"dur":3,"text":"I think, for the students\nwho are thinking of studying."},"385":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'm really\ninterested to find out"},"387":{"dur":1,"text":"whether that's the\nsort of thing they"},"388":{"dur":1,"text":"would like to study with us."},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"The kinds of creative\nindustries that we mean"},"394":{"dur":4,"text":"are things like film\nmaking, music production,"},"399":{"dur":1,"text":"creative design."},"400":{"dur":3,"text":"But also things in\ngraphic design, computing."},"404":{"dur":2,"text":"Anything from that\nsort of thing too."},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"Managing festivals,\nwhich sounds really cool."},"408":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Yeah,\nno, absolutely."},"409":{"dur":1,"text":"I can imagine a lot of people\nwould be interested in that."},"411":{"dur":2,"text":"But as you say, it's a growth\narea, a very exciting area."},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"An area that other\nuniversities are often"},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"supplying, quite niche,\nspecific things about."},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"So you're already scoping\nsomething new and saying hey,"},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"should we be doing this\nat the Open University?"},"423":{"dur":0,"text":"ALISON GREEN: Yes."},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Should we\nbe doing it, I guess,"},"426":{"dur":1,"text":"in terms of a whole\nqualification?"},"427":{"dur":1,"text":"Or is it something\nthat maybe people want"},"429":{"dur":1,"text":"to tap onto an open degree."},"430":{"dur":1,"text":"Are those sorts of things you're\ninterested in finding out?"},"432":{"dur":0,"text":"ALISON GREEN: Those are\nthe kinds of things."},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"I'd say we'd like to\nfind out whether you'd"},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"be interested in studying for a\nfull qualification in something"},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"like creative\nindustries generally,"},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"or whether you'd be\ninterested in something"},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"that might be focused\nin a particular area"},"444":{"dur":1,"text":"like, for example, music?"},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"We already have a qualification\nin creative writing,"},"448":{"dur":1,"text":"for example, which\nis hugely popular."},"449":{"dur":3,"text":"We have hundreds of students\nstudying that and enjoying it."},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think, for me,\nthe questions are what"},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"would students like to study?"},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"Would they like to study\nqualification, or just"},"459":{"dur":5,"text":"a modulus as part of an open\ndegree or part of our arts"},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"And we're taking a\nquick snapshot there"},"467":{"dur":1,"text":"of what you think at home."},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"But how else are you going\nto be finding out about this?"},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"And when, if students say yes,\nwe'd like this sort of thing,"},"474":{"dur":0,"text":"when might it come into being?"},"475":{"dur":1,"text":"What's sort of time frame\nfor developing this?"},"477":{"dur":1,"text":"ALISON GREEN: Wow,\nthat's a lot of -"},"478":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: I\nknow you move fast."},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"ALISON GREEN: We\ntry and move fast."},"480":{"dur":1,"text":"When we know that\nthere's evidence"},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"that students want\nto study things,"},"483":{"dur":1,"text":"then we will try and\nmove as fast as we can."},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"So the process is thinking\nabout the curriculum that we"},"488":{"dur":0,"text":"currently."},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"Is it fit for purpose?"},"491":{"dur":1,"text":"If it isn't, what\nmore do we need to do?"},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"What planning do we need to\ndo to design it properly?"},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"And then conversations with\ncolleagues to make sure"},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"that we, we brainstorm."},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"Which is really exciting,\nhaving those discussions"},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"around new opportunities."},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"I think we're talking about,\noh, a couple of years, perhaps."},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"But we will try and move quickly\nif this looks to be something"},"509":{"dur":1,"text":"that people really want to do."},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, thank you so\nmuch for coming."},"513":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'm going to feed\nthat information back."},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: And if you\nhaven't voted on that yet,"},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"please do select your choice\nfrom those five widgets"},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"so that we can feed back to\nAlison what sorts of things"},"521":{"dur":1,"text":"you'd be interested in doing."},"523":{"dur":1,"text":"Right, next up on\nthe show, we're"},"525":{"dur":1,"text":"going to be talking\nto Simon Bell."},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, Simon's coming\nback tonight."},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"And he's going to\nbe doing a session"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"on who's afraid of the\nbig bad environment?"},"532":{"dur":1,"text":"Because he's written a book."},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is very exciting."},"535":{"dur":0,"text":"Welcome, Simon."},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you."},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"How's the book going?"},"539":{"dur":0,"text":"SIMON BELL: Ha!"},"540":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: How's it\ngoing, getting published?"},"541":{"dur":0,"text":"SIMON BELL: It's going well."},"542":{"dur":0,"text":"Yes, it's good."},"543":{"dur":1,"text":"SIMON BELL: Two books, not\njust one book, two books."},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Right, you\nhave been busy, OK, good."},"547":{"dur":1,"text":"Now tell our\nstudents about this."},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"And tell us the angle\nthat you're coming at,"},"550":{"dur":0,"text":"which is quite interesting."},"551":{"dur":0,"text":"SIMON BELL: OK, well\nthere's a good tie-in"},"552":{"dur":1,"text":"actually to the modules\nwe teach as well."},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"We were doing some research\ntwo or three years ago"},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"on T219, T319,\nenvironmental management."},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"And these are interesting\nmodules, all right,"},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"but they contain also group\nwork, and the containment"},"563":{"dur":1,"text":"of thinking about\nthe environment"},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"and about climate change."},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"And doing this, I just\nkept coming across"},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"worry, and anxiety, and fear."},"570":{"dur":1,"text":"And the more I studied\nit, the more I thought,"},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"well, this needs to be\nlooked at in a systemic way."},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"So we started thinking\nabout writing a book,"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"studying it probably, thinking\nabout what is the fear"},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"behind climate change?"},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"And opening up that, you\nlook all over the place."},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"And you end up with\nwell, project fear,"},"585":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Yeah."},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"So have you found out\nwhat the problem is?"},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah, it's in the book."},"590":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Very good, OK."},"591":{"dur":1,"text":"SIMON BELL: Actually both books."},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: This is just\na big plug, isn't it?"},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"What's interesting, though,\nis how you've done the book."},"597":{"dur":1,"text":"SIMON BELL: OK, well\nthere's two books."},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"First was the theory book."},"599":{"dur":1,"text":"The proper academic\nbook, if you like."},"600":{"dur":1,"text":"That's called\nFormations of Terror."},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"And that, I feel like, gives\nyou the substantial background."},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"But we thought, let's\ndo a graphic novel, too."},"607":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's try and make the book\nif you like seeing a bit more,"},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"and bring the ideas across."},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can see that the\nhat I'm wearing is a prop."},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"Because you can see\nthat I am the narrator"},"617":{"dur":1,"text":"in the graphic novel as well."},"618":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Wow."},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"SIMON BELL: And it tells\nthe story about fear,"},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"about people like how Donald\nTrump, maybe, for example,"},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: And this format,\nI mean the graphic novel,"},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"portrays a very different\nsort of spin on things."},"629":{"dur":0,"text":"Why was that important?"},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"And I guess, as an academic,\nwhy isn't it important that you"},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"then got something that people\ncould effectively colour"},"634":{"dur":0,"text":"in if they wanted to?"},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"SIMON BELL: You were just\ntalking about creativity,"},"636":{"dur":0,"text":"creative arts."},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, we need to be\ncreative in the way we"},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"talk about our studies."},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"We need to think about how we're\ngoing to project what we learn."},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"And there are lots of\nways of projecting."},"646":{"dur":0,"text":"I mean, I love e-books."},"647":{"dur":1,"text":"And I love stuff like that."},"648":{"dur":1,"text":"I also like comics."},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"I think there's great ways\nof meeting more minds."},"651":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is just one of them."},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: And so would you\nexpect different audiences then"},"655":{"dur":0,"text":"for these two books?"},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"SIMON BELL: Maybe, maybe."},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Or\nare they your fans?"},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"SIMON BELL: I don't know."},"660":{"dur":1,"text":"I would hope that\npeople maybe who"},"662":{"dur":3,"text":"find the idea of the\nacademic text too heavy"},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"might find the idea of\nthe graphic novel less so."},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"I think, though, they tell\nslightly different stories"},"670":{"dur":0,"text":"about the same thing."},"671":{"dur":1,"text":"And they tell it\nin different ways."},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"So I think, maybe,\ntwo different markets."},"674":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe there's an\noverlap there as well."},"676":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: But this\nis one of the things,"},"677":{"dur":1,"text":"I guess, in education\nis that there"},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"are different ways of\ncommunicating, isn't there?"},"681":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: And\ndifferent audiences,"},"682":{"dur":0,"text":"and different purposes."},"683":{"dur":1,"text":"And I have that's\nbrilliant that you've"},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"managed to get two\nvery different outputs"},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"and two different books in\nsuch a short space of time."},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"Tell us what you're going to\ncome and talk about tonight."},"691":{"dur":1,"text":"SIMON BELL: Well, Stephen\nPeake and I, this

would like,"},"953":{"dur":3,"text":"to our newsletter to get\nsome details about that."},"957":{"dur":1,"text":"But honing down on\nthese values I guess"},"959":{"dur":1,"text":"gives people an

principle really\nis about being a welcoming"},"973":{"dur":2,"text":"and inclusive community."},"975":{"dur":3,"text":"So it covers things\nlike valuing diversity."},"979":{"dur":4,"text":"It covers things like how we\ncommunicate with each other."},"983":{"dur":4,"text":"How we adapt to different needs\nand different circumstances."},"987":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's all about being\ninclusive and welcoming"},"991":{"dur":2,"text":"and working together."},"993":{"dur":2,"text":"It's about respecting\nconfidentiality and using"},"996":{"dur":1,"text":"information, that sort of thing."},"998":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: And\nthat's so important."},"999":{"dur":2,"text":"Because we do have a very\ndiverse student body, don't we?"},"1002":{"dur":1,"text":"JERARD BRETTS: Yes,

responsibilities"},"1011":{"dur":3,"text":"of our academic community\nin particular to inspire"},"1015":{"dur":2,"text":"and enable learning."},"1017":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's all about things\nlike

learning."},"1028":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's about maintaining high\nacademic standards as well."},"1032":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's all about\nthe values relating"},"1035":{"dur":4,"text":"to the academic\naspects of study,"},"1040":{"dur":2,"text":"providing high-quality\ndistance materials."},"1043":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you like, it's the staff\nresponsibilities and staff"},"1047":{"dur":1,"text":"values that this\nprinciple covers."},"1049":{"dur":2,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: And we can\nsee this in so many ways."},"1051":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, we've heard about

they get to\nvarious services"},"1059":{"dur":1,"text":"here so that they can\nthen make that leap."},"1061":{"dur":1,"text":"You have to do it all\non your own, don't you?"},"1063":{"dur":2,"text":"But there is a lot of support\nthat you can get along the way."},"1066":{"dur":2,"text":"And this just talks about\nthe responsibilities of

third one is\nabout responsibilities"},"1075":{"dur":2,"text":"of students for learning."},"1078":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's about students\nusing information, advice,"},"1082":{"dur":3,"text":"and guidance, and the services\nprovided, using the learning"},"1086":{"dur":4,"text":"resources, about students\ncompleting scheduled activities"},"1090":{"dur":4,"text":"on time, engaging with us

this"},"1116":{"dur":2,"text":"is what we would expect\npeople to give back"},"1118":{"dur":2,"text":"and had to take control\nof their learning"},"1120":{"dur":1,"text":"and take control of\ntheir

one?"},"1126":{"dur":0,"text":"JERARD BRETTS: Right."},"1127":{"dur":3,"text":"Last but not least, it's\nabout working together"},"1130":{"dur":3,"text":"to secure the OU's mission\nand promote the

inclusive,\ninnovative, and responsive."},"1144":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is all about\nmaking the charter"},"1146":{"dur":2,"text":"principles central to the OU."},"1149":{"dur":5,"text":"So that

think\nit's activities like this"},"1210":{"dur":2,"text":"which will increase awareness."},"1213":{"dur":2,"text":"Our investigations\nto date suggest"},"1216":{"dur":4,"text":"that a good percentage
