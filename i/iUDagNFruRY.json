training after I saw\nwomen's boxing on television."},"537":{"dur":3,"text":"And I was in school full\ntime, and I had a business--"},"541":{"dur":1,"text":"I had a nail salon\nbecause I started"},"542":{"dur":2,"text":"going to school to learn how\nto do nails when I was 16."},"545":{"dur":3,"text":"And I built up my clientele,\nsaved up my money,"},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"I was subleasing."},"549":{"dur":1,"text":"And I had this whole\nplan, and I'm a planner."},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"So I was like, I'm\ngoing to go to school,"},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going to live on\nmy own, which I did."},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'm going to focus on\nbuilding this business."},"558":{"dur":1,"text":"And then all of a sudden\nI see women's

television to\nwatch a Mike Tyson fight,"},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"and I wasn't a big boxing fan,\nbut I watched the big fights,"},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"and then here come these women\ninto the ring on the under"},"572":{"dur":0,"text":"card."},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think that was the\nfirst time a lot of people"},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"saw women's boxing, and\nthat moment-- that's when"},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"the seed was planted within me."},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"And I remember saying,\nI want to do that."},"582":{"dur":3,"text":"And I was with my best friend\nand her

it."},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"But then when I went home,\nand the fear and the doubt"},"591":{"dur":3,"text":"started to set in, and I don't\nknow if I'd be able to do it,"},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"meaning change my plans."},"596":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, I've told everybody."},"597":{"dur":1,"text":"I've said this is\nmy plan, and

away,"},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"so I thought about it\nfor I think about a year."},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm really bad with timelines,\nbut it took us about a year."},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"And then I decided,\nyou know what,"},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going to go find a\ntrainer and start training."},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"And I did it all on my own."},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"I didn't ask my dad for help."},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"I was still trying to figure out\nif it was something I actually"},"619":{"dur":1,"text":"wanted to do-- if I\nhad the talent to do,"},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"because I knew I was going to\nbe successful with this nail"},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"business and become\nan entrepreneur,"},"626":{"dur":1,"text":"and boxing was so new for me."},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"So I went to the gym,\nstarted training,"},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"and at a certain point my\nfather found out about it,"},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"and I had already\ndecided that yes, I"},"634":{"dur":1,"text":"was, in fact, going to do it."},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's when he asked me--"},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"came in town, because he didn't\nlive in Los Angeles-- and said,"},"640":{"dur":1,"text":"you know, I hear\nthat you're boxing,"},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"and you're going\nto start fighting."},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"I was like, yeah I am."},"644":{"dur":3,"text":"He basically tried to talk\nme out of it indirectly."},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"That's how my father-- he\nbrings up every negative thing"},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"that he possibly can."},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"What happens if you\nget knocked out?"},"653":{"dur":1,"text":"What happens if you\nget knocked down?"},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"The whole world's going\nto be watching you,"},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"and all my answers\nwas based on-- well,"},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"when you got knocked\ndown, you got back up."},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't think I want to get\nknocked out, but if I do,"},"661":{"dur":0,"text":"I'm going to ask for a rematch."},"662":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, I gave\nall these answers,"},"663":{"dur":1,"text":"like what else could he say?"},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"And he knew he was\ntalking to Laila,"},"667":{"dur":3,"text":"and he knows Laila is going\nto do what she wants to do."},"670":{"dur":3,"text":"He was like, OK, he knew he\ncouldn't tell me not to do it,"},"673":{"dur":1,"text":"so we had that talk."},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"And I just said, hey, you're\neither going to support me,"},"677":{"dur":0,"text":"or you're not."},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"And he made it very clear\nthat he didn't really"},"680":{"dur":1,"text":"think women should be fighting."},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"My father was a little\nbit of a male chauvinist,"},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"and so that was\nsomething I was like,"},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm not going to try to change\nyour mind about that, other"},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"than I'm going to show\nyou what I can do."},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to show\nyou that I can do it."},"693":{"dur":1,"text":"So I started boxing."},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"And needless to say--"},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"maybe I do need to say it--"},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"I did change his mind about it."},"699":{"dur":3,"text":"Know He was like, wow,\nyou really can fight."},"702":{"dur":0,"text":"Women can fight."},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"He had a whole different\nthought in his mind"},"707":{"dur":1,"text":"when it came to\nwomen in the ring."},"708":{"dur":1,"text":"- Did he come to\nany of your fights?"},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"He was at most of my fights."},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"He didn't make it to all of\nthem just because he was sick"},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"and couldn't always be\nthere, but he was there."},"717":{"dur":1,"text":"Over half of the\nfights he was there."},"719":{"dur":3,"text":"- So when he showed up, did\nhe try to sneak in the back?"},"722":{"dur":1,"text":"- Oh my dad?"},"724":{"dur":0,"text":"- Right."},"728":{"dur":3,"text":"- Every time he walked in\nit was like, Ali, Ali, Ali,"},"732":{"dur":0,"text":"and he loved it."},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"- That's good for you because\nthe crowd was on your side."},"736":{"dur":1,"text":"- Well yeah, but the crowd--"},"737":{"dur":3,"text":"was what was surreal about my\nboxing career was just that I"},"741":{"dur":1,"text":"felt like I was\nfighting for both of us,"},"742":{"dur":3,"text":"because he couldn't-- just with\nhis Parkinson's-- and I knew I"},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"could see in his eyes he would\nlove to be back in that ring"},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"So I felt like I was\nkind of doing it for him"},"751":{"dur":1,"text":"and he was living\nthrough me, as well."},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"So when he walked\nin and everyone"},"755":{"dur":4,"text":"started chanting Ali and\nthen again when I came out."},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"I never really\nfocused on my dad when"},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"whether he was going to be there\nor not because as a fighter,"},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"I like to just really be\nfocused on the mission at hand."},"768":{"dur":1,"text":"I can't worry about\nwho's in the audience."},"770":{"dur":2,"text":"And then after the fight,\nI always looked for my dad"},"773":{"dur":3,"text":"and just kind of see that joy\nand excitement in his eyes."},"776":{"dur":2,"text":"- And when you look\nat him, was it--"},"779":{"dur":4,"text":"again, I know, he was\ngradually losing the abilities"},"783":{"dur":3,"text":"that obviously made him who\nhe was, but his personality--"},"787":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, did you\nsee it in his eyes?"},"788":{"dur":1,"text":"- Oh yeah."},"790":{"dur":3,"text":"- What would he do to\nshow you how much he"},"793":{"dur":1,"text":"was loving what you\nwere doing after being"},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"so reluctant at first?"},"796":{"dur":1,"text":"- Well, my father--"},"798":{"dur":4,"text":"well, first of all, he told me\nthat he had a change of heart."},"802":{"dur":3,"text":"So I changed his mind\nabout just not just me,"},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"but women in general\nbeing able to fight."},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"He had to get past-- my father\nis Muslim, and I'm not--"},"811":{"dur":2,"text":"and a lot of people\nassume that I am,"},"814":{"dur":2,"text":"but that was an issue\njust wearing a sports bra"},"816":{"dur":1,"text":"and shorts in the ring with him."},"818":{"dur":1,"text":"And I was like, dad, really?"},"819":{"dur":1,"text":"That's what you're\nthinking about?"},"821":{"dur":3,"text":"But just being able to watch\nme in the ring as a fighter"},"824":{"dur":2,"text":"and not seeing a woman, per\nse, but seeing a fighter."},"826":{"dur":3,"text":"And he knows that you\nhave to respect the game."},"830":{"dur":3,"text":"He knows how hard it is to train\nand to prepare and all of that,"},"833":{"dur":2,"text":"and it has nothing to do with\nbeing a woman or being a man."},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"So just for him to be able\nto see past all of that"},"838":{"dur":1,"text":"and show me my respect,\nand at the same time,"},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"be so surprised because he\nwasn't there to see me train."},"842":{"dur":1,"text":"He didn't know when\nhe was going to see."},"844":{"dur":1,"text":"And then to be able\nto see the way that I"},"845":{"dur":1,"text":"was able to dominate."},"847":{"dur":3,"text":"And then, of course, it's\nlike, you're just like me."},"850":{"dur":3,"text":"Now you want to take credit,
