a\nRepublican governor who"},"617":{"dur":3,"text":"ultimately became the\nnominee for the Republican"},"620":{"dur":4,"text":"Party -- that came close"},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"to providing universal

the law passed, for\nthe last six, seven years,"},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"there has been the\nargument that we can"},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"provide a great\nreplacement that will

the time\nwhen Republicans, I think,"},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"have to go ahead and\nshow their cards."},"747":{"dur":4,"text":"If, in fact, they have\na program that

baseline things\nthat you got to do."},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"Number one, health\ncare is not cheap."},"798":{"dur":2,"text":"And for people who can't\nafford health care
