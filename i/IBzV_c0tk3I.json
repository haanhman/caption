more creative and strategic."},"165":{"dur":1,"text":"- Just to dig in very slightly,"},"167":{"dur":3,"text":"those are pretty broad terms, talent."},"171":{"dur":1,"text":"So what do we mean by them?"},"172":{"dur":3,"text":"- Talent is really kind of everything."},"175":{"dur":2,"text":"Somebody who scored high on one thing"},"178":{"dur":2,"text":"tended to score high on a

CEOs,"},"381":{"dur":4,"text":"but those will vary depending\non the situation, of course."},"387":{"dur":1,"text":"- Steve Kaplan, quite a lot of attention,"},"389":{"dur":1,"text":"when this research came out,"},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"was focused on the fact that CEOs"},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"didn't necessarily have to be nice."},"395":{"dur":1,"text":"- Correct."},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"So, where does that come from?"},"401":{"dur":4,"text":"The data, if you look at this\nfactor, this execution factor,"},"406":{"dur":3,"text":"the flip side of that

that mean that\nlikability and execution"},"463":{"dur":3,"text":"are actually two\ndiametrically opposed skills?"},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"- Likability, I think, is the wrong word."},"469":{"dur":3,"text":"I think agreeableness is the right word."},"472":{"dur":3,"text":"If you look, again, at the\ndata, holding talent constant,"},"475":{"dur":3,"text":"there's this trade-off\nbetween being agreeable"},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"and being execution oriented."},"481":{"dur":3,"text":"I think that comes from when you execute,"},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"when you move fast,\nwhen you're aggressive,"},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"sometimes you step on toes"},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"and you appear not to be agreeable."},"492":{"dur":3,"text":"If you are consensus\noriented and a little slow,"},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"you're going to appear agreeable."},"497":{"dur":4,"text":"I think there is a definite\nconflict between those."},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"The danger of being

other paper,\nthe people who executed"},"517":{"dur":3,"text":"were the people who were successful."},"521":{"dur":1,"text":"- Just to explain, your\nother paper was about,"},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"once the CEOs are in position,\nhow well did they do."},"525":{"dur":0,"text":"- Exactly."},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"In talking to executives"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"and talking to private equity investors,"},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"this actually resonates."},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"If you want an example\nthat people are aware of,"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"Steve Jobs and Jeff Bezos"},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"are two people who are not\nknown to be the nicest people,"},"544":{"dur":2,"text":"but boy do they get things done"},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"and people like to

the difference is"},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"just what Steve is talking about,"},"571":{"dur":3,"text":"is that great leaders have\nto contribute to results."},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"Bottom line, impact."},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're unable to do\nthat, you're a great leader,"},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"but you haven't made that\nsuccessful transition."},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"- You don't have to be a jerk."},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm not saying you have to be a jerk."},"586":{"dur":3,"text":"I think you can be agreeable\nand still get things done,"},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"but they are sometimes in conflict."},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"If you have to get things done,"},"593":{"dur":3,"text":"sometimes you will, you\nknow, not be so nice."},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"- Our data supports that,\nSteve, about agreeableness,"},"600":{"dur":1,"text":"but it also says that the best CEOs"},"602":{"dur":4,"text":"tend to be unpretentious and\nthat that creates a difference."},"606":{"dur":1,"text":"So something to think about."},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"- Unpretentious makes\nthem more likable, or--?"},"611":{"dur":3,"text":"- Makes them able to get their\nteams and their stakeholders"},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"to execute more effectively."},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"- My questions would be\nhow would you balance"},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"not getting bogged down in decision-making"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"with letting everyone have their say"},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"and listening to people?"},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"- I mean, that's part of\nwhat being a great leader is,"},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"if you look at it."},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"We've looked at it, and great\nleaders have confidence."},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"So they're willing to take\nin all the information,"},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"take in the data, and make a decision."},"636":{"dur":3,"text":"They're willing, as\nSteve said, to execute,"},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"to make a decision, to live by it."},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"People can agree or not agree."},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"If you look at great leaders,"},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"great CEOs, quite frankly, as well,"},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"make decisions and lead."},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"People follow because\nthey've made the decisions."},"652":{"dur":0,"text":"They're willing to execute."},"653":{"dur":1,"text":"They take the risk."},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"- Right, and the worst thing\nis not to make a decision."},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"- Then, you know nothing will happen."},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"If you make a decision and it's wrong,"},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"if you fix it, you can\nstill be successful,"},"664":{"dur":1,"text":"but you've made a decision."},"666":{"dur":1,"text":"- I think, going on\nwhat you were mentioning"},"667":{"dur":1,"text":"about being unpretentious,"},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"an element of that is being genuine."},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"- How do you, as a\nheadhunter, measure that?"},"673":{"dur":1,"text":"- It's not easy."},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"Part of it is just talking\nto individuals about"},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"how they've achieved success"},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"and the environment that\ntook place around that."},"683":{"dur":1,"text":"- Very much so."},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"I think what we are increasingly doing"},"685":{"dur":3,"text":"is focusing on the science behind our art."},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"Our art is to help select\nand evaluate talent."},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"Increasingly, we're\ndeveloping tools to look at"},"694":{"dur":3,"text":"how do leaders make\ndecisions, how do they lead."},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"For example, we have a tool\ncalled Leadership Signature,"},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"which looks at how does a leader lead."},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"What's their style?"},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"Certain leaders fit certain styles,"},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"as Constantine talked about,\nand certain situations."},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"You're looking to bring together a team"},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"that has complimentary leadership styles"},"712":{"dur":1,"text":"to then move the organization forward."},"714":{"dur":3,"text":"- It's a combination of data\nand analysis and experience."},"718":{"dur":3,"text":"- Now, how much comes from\ninterviewing the candidate"},"722":{"dur":4,"text":"versus reference checks\nversus or taking tests."},"726":{"dur":0,"text":"Those are three different--"},"727":{"dur":0,"text":"- It's all part of it."},"728":{"dur":1,"text":"- So you do all three?"},"729":{"dur":0,"text":"- Yes.\n- We do all three."},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"I think what you find is\nyou look for the outliers."},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"Where is that something is incongruent"},"736":{"dur":1,"text":"to what you found in the interview"},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"to what the psychometric\ntest or their competency says"},"742":{"dur":1,"text":"to what their reference says."},"743":{"dur":1,"text":"What you generally look at, for us,"},"745":{"dur":3,"text":"is we take the first two,\nand that's the context"},"748":{"dur":1,"text":"in which we take the reference"},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"to look at where there might\nbe gaps and incongruencies."},"753":{"dur":1,"text":"But they all come together."},"754":{"dur":1,"text":"- To what extent, then, in your mind,"},"755":{"dur":3,"text":"is this leadership you talk\nabout inherent or learned?"},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"(panel members laugh)"},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"- I will say this,"},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't believe that\ngreat leaders are born."},"765":{"dur":1,"text":"I think great leaders are developed."},"766":{"dur":1,"text":"If that's the case,"},"767":{"dur":1,"text":"I probably wouldn't be\nsitting in this room."},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"A lot of us would not be in this room."},"771":{"dur":3,"text":"There is a element\naround community context"},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"and mentorship that great leaders have."},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that one of the\nthings that they are,"},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"we didn't talk about\nthis, is they're learners."},"781":{"dur":1,"text":"They're quick and adaptive learners."},"783":{"dur":3,"text":"The context of this is you put\nthem in the right situation,"},"786":{"dur":3,"text":"they learn from it, and they grow from it."},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"So I don't think they're\nborn, to answer your question."},"793":{"dur":0,"text":"- I might add a little more"},"794":{"dur":2,"text":"that I think that foundation\nis very important,"},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"and I would weight toward\nhaving that foundation."},"799":{"dur":1,"text":"- And what's the evidence for that?"},"800":{"dur":3,"text":"It's the fact that there\nare a number of CEOs"},"803":{"dur":4,"text":"who got their early career\ntraining in academy companies."},"808":{"dur":3,"text":"So it was that exposure\ntraining, operational experience"},"811":{"dur":1,"text":"that allowed them to apply their traits"},"812":{"dur":1,"text":"and become successful."},"814":{"dur":3,"text":"- I would say, on the data side,"},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"the fact that these people are"},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"rated at a certain point in time"},"824":{"dur":4,"text":"and five, 10 years later, it's predictive,"},"828":{"dur":4,"text":"that suggests there's something\nthat's innate or long-term."},"833":{"dur":2,"text":"It may be it's not clear\nwhen they learned it,"},"835":{"dur":1,"text":"because these people were all assessed"},"837":{"dur":2,"text":"in their probably their 40s,"},"839":{"dur":2,"text":"but it's something that does last."},"842":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not learned in the sense that"},"846":{"dur":2,"text":"the stuff when you're\nassessed is
