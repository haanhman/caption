me."},"68":{"dur":4,"text":"Yeah, we advertise the\nbook on AdWords a lot."},"73":{"dur":1,"text":"Sell a bunch."},"75":{"dur":4,"text":"So what does having to run a\nnuclear submarine have anything"},"79":{"dur":1,"text":"to do with working\nhere at Google?"},"81":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, hopefully by the\nend of this session,"},"83":{"dur":1,"text":"you'll have some

about\nleadership, which I now think"},"92":{"dur":3,"text":"are actually unhelpful\nor just basically wrong."},"95":{"dur":3,"text":"So here we are with the\ncrew on the submarine."},"98":{"dur":2,"text":"Submarines spend most of\ntheir time underwater."},"101":{"dur":2,"text":"And even when the submarine is\non the surface, most of it's"},"103":{"dur":1,"text":"underwater, like an iceberg."},"104":{"dur":2,"text":"But here, the\nsubmarine's in dry dock."},"106":{"dur":4,"text":"There's a crew of about 135,\nthe average age is 27

officers."},"115":{"dur":1,"text":"These are the only guys\nwith college degrees."},"117":{"dur":2,"text":"Then the technicians,\nthe blue shirts,"},"119":{"dur":1,"text":"are the guys who\ndo all the work."},"121":{"dur":1,"text":"And then over here,\nthese are the chiefs,"},"123":{"dur":1,"text":"so they've been technicians."},"124":{"dur":1,"text":"They did a good job,\nthey got promoted."},"126":{"dur":2,"text":"They've been in the\nNavy for 6, 8, 10 years."},"128":{"dur":1,"text":"We promote them,\nwe let them wear"},"129":{"dur":3,"text":"the same brown,

leaders."},"139":{"dur":1,"text":"So there's not a lot\nof room on a submarine,"},"141":{"dur":1,"text":"because we're going to\nput all these people"},"142":{"dur":1,"text":"inside the submarine and\nmost of the submarine"},"144":{"dur":2,"text":"is taken up by equipment."},"147":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's not a lot\nof exercise space."},"149":{"dur":1,"text":"So for example, one\nof the things we do"},"151":{"dur":1,"text":"is we take a SEAL\nteam, and we have"},"152":{"dur":2,"text":"to deliver them to wherever\nthey're going to do."},"154":{"dur":3,"text":"Any SEALs out here,\nSpecial Forces people?"},"157":{"dur":1,"text":"I know I've got at\nleast one Marine."},"159":{"dur":6,"text":"OK, so these SEALs are\nsuper fit individuals."},"165":{"dur":2,"text":"They in the gym all the time."},"168":{"dur":1,"text":"But there's no gym\non a submarine,"},"169":{"dur":2,"text":"so their bodies deteriorate\nevery passing day."},"172":{"dur":2,"text":"So the Navy says, you can't\nbring these SEALs on board"},"174":{"dur":2,"text":"until the very last minute,\nbecause the submarine"},"176":{"dur":4,"text":"is a toxic environment for\nthese elite individuals,"},"181":{"dur":1,"text":"these elite athletes."},"182":{"dur":1,"text":"Now this was always\ntroublesome for me,"},"184":{"dur":2,"text":"because we'd live\nthere for 180 days."},"187":{"dur":3,"text":"No one cared about that!"},"190":{"dur":0,"text":"So here's what happens."},"191":{"dur":2,"text":"They say, we've got to\npick up a SEAL team."},"193":{"dur":3,"text":"So we take the submarine\naway from the shoreline."},"197":{"dur":1,"text":"We surface it, which\nwe don't like to do."},"198":{"dur":2,"text":"It puts us in a\nvulnerable position."},"200":{"dur":3,"text":"And we want to be there as\nshort a time as possible."},"204":{"dur":1,"text":"Then the helicopter shows\nup with the SEAL team."},"206":{"dur":2,"text":"They're going to\ncome down this rope."},"208":{"dur":2,"text":"These guys in orange, this\nis the submarine crew."},"211":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm up here, in charge\nof this deal, right?"},"216":{"dur":2,"text":"And then we've got to find\nsome young guy to go back"},"218":{"dur":2,"text":"here and hold on to this rope."},"220":{"dur":3,"text":"Because it's important to\ntether the rope at the bottom."},"223":{"dur":1,"text":"SEAL team comes\ndown one at a time."},"225":{"dur":3,"text":"Now this young man, in my\ncase there were all men."},"229":{"dur":2,"text":"We now have women on submarines,\nwhich I think is great."},"231":{"dur":2,"text":"But this young man has got to\nmake a bunch of snap decisions."},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"Because we're moving together."},"236":{"dur":3,"text":"And if the helicopter hovers\nand it starts moving away,"},"240":{"dur":2,"text":"do I let go of the rope,\ndo I hold on to the rope."},"242":{"dur":2,"text":"A wave comes, could\nknock someone overboard."},"245":{"dur":2,"text":"And this person is going to\nmake a bunch of

see\nwhat's going on."},"277":{"dur":6,"text":"And we think oh, when I get\ninto the moment of crisis,"},"283":{"dur":3,"text":"when the disruption comes, we're\ngoing to really want to

weird."},"570":{"dur":4,"text":"But that's because this has\ninfluenced the way we talk."},"574":{"dur":4,"text":"And so that's influencing\nour behaviors."},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"And schools were\ndesigned to create"},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"people who were\ncomfortable going"},"582":{"dur":1,"text":"into environments like that."},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"So the schools were

expected\nthis, well, I'll tell you."},"1029":{"dur":1,"text":"But I didn't know either."},"1031":{"dur":2,"text":"So the first thing was,\noh man, I shouldn't"},"1034":{"dur":1,"text":"have asked

how we control the\nspeed of the submarine."},"1102":{"dur":2,"text":"Now I just took over the worst\nperforming ship in the fleet."},"1104":{"dur":2,"text":"And what we're going to do\nis our favorite exercise,"},"1106":{"dur":1,"text":"we're going to shut\ndown a reactor,"},"1108":{"dur":2,"text":"and we're going to run on\nan electric backup motor."},"1110":{"dur":2,"text":"This is not like a Tesla, right?"},"1113":{"dur":2,"text":"This is a 300 horsepower\nelectric motor,"},"1115":{"dur":1,"text":"but it's in a 6,000\nton submarine."},"1117":{"dur":2,"text":"So this electric motor just\nbarely pushes the submarine"},"1120":{"dur":1,"text":"through the water."},"1121":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's two speeds."},"1122":{"dur":1,"text":"So what's happening\nis when you're"},"1123":{"dur":2,"text":"operating the electric motor\nwith the reactor shut down,"},"1126":{"dur":2,"text":"you're draining the\nbattery pretty quickly."},"1128":{"dur":3,"text":"And there's a race to\nget the reactor started."},"1132":{"dur":1,"text":"So here we are,\nwe're running on."},"1134":{"dur":1,"text":"We're at 1\/3."},"1136":{"dur":2,"text":"We shut down the reactors,\nthe very first drill."},"1138":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm standing in\nthe control room."},"1141":{"dur":1,"text":"The officer has been\non the submarine"},"1142":{"dur":3,"text":"the longest, Bill Green is\nhis

other\nsubmarine I've been on,"},"1152":{"dur":2,"text":"there was two speeds\nto this electric motor."},"1154":{"dur":4,"text":"But unbeknownst to me, on the\nSanta Fe, there's only one."},"1158":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'm thinking,\nhey, if we speed up,"},"1160":{"dur":1,"text":"it's going to drain\nthe battery faster,"},"1162":{"dur":2,"text":"it's gonna put some\nstress on the team."},"1164":{"dur":1,"text":"Train harder."},"1165":{"dur":1,"text":"And so I suggest, hey,\nwhy don't we speed up"},"1167":{"dur":2,"text":"on this electric motor?"},"1169":{"dur":1,"text":"And he gives the order."},"1171":{"dur":1,"text":"But the sailor\nsitting at this panel"},"1172":{"dur":3,"text":"does nothing, actually\nkind of goes like this."},"1176":{"dur":1,"text":"I said, hey, what's going on?"},"1178":{"dur":2,"text":"He says captain, on this\nship, unlike your other ships,"},"1180":{"dur":2,"text":"it's just one speed motoring."},"1183":{"dur":1,"text":"That was embarrassing."},"1184":{"dur":1,"text":"And I thought about\nBill, and I said"},"1186":{"dur":1,"text":"Bill, do you know about this."},"1187":{"dur":3,"text":"And he said, yes, sir I did."},"1191":{"dur":1,"text":"Really?"},"1192":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, riddle me this."},"1194":{"dur":1,"text":"Why did you order it?"},"1195":{"dur":1,"text":"What do you guys think he said?"},"1197":{"dur":2,"text":"Exactly, because it's all\nabout telling people what to do"},"1199":{"dur":2,"text":"and doing what you're told."},"1202":{"dur":2,"text":"And this was like a\nhammer blow to my head."},"1205":{"dur":1,"text":"Because my whole\nleadership training"},"1206":{"dur":3,"text":"was about being really good\nat telling people what to do."},"1210":{"dur":2,"text":"So I said, look,\nI'm going to stop"},"1212":{"dur":1,"text":"telling you guys what to do."},"1213":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm gonna stop giving\nyou guys orders."},"1215":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm never going to\ngive another order"},"1217":{"dur":1,"text":"as a captain of a submarine."},"1218":{"dur":2,"text":"And they were like, OK."},"1221":{"dur":1,"text":"No one knew what\nthat would look like,"},"1222":{"dur":2,"text":"but it was better than\ndying, which is what"},"1224":{"dur":1,"text":"would have happened eventually."},"1226":{"dur":3,"text":"So we say, good leaders give\ngood orders, that's the myth."},"1229":{"dur":2,"text":"I now think good leaders\nactually don't give orders."},"1232":{"dur":4,"text":"They create a team that doesn't\nneed to be told what to do."},"1236":{"dur":2,"text":"So now I've decided not to\ngive my guys any instructions."},"1238":{"dur":1,"text":"I still don't know\nthe submarine."},"1240":{"dur":3,"text":"So now I'm a know\nnot, tell not leader."},"1243":{"dur":1,"text":"If you're brand new\nto an organization,"},"1245":{"dur":3,"text":"maybe this is where you need\nto live for a few days, weeks,"},"1248":{"dur":0,"text":"or months."},"1249":{"dur":1,"text":"But eventually people\nare going to stop"},"1250":{"dur":1,"text":"paying you for being down here."},"1252":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's not a good\nlong term strategy."},"1254":{"dur":2,"text":"Now the torpedoes,\nhere's how they work."},"1257":{"dur":1,"text":"First of all, there's\na long wire that"},"1259":{"dur":1,"text":"pays out through the ocean."},"1260":{"dur":3,"text":"So when we shoot the torpedo, it\nconnects back to the submarine"},"1263":{"dur":1,"text":"and it sends signals\nback saying, here's"},"1265":{"dur":3,"text":"what I'm seeing as I'm out\nhere looking for the bad guy."},"1268":{"dur":2,"text":"And we can steer it."},"1270":{"dur":2,"text":"We can say turn\nright 20 degrees."},"1273":{"dur":0,"text":"Turn left, whatever."},"1274":{"dur":3,"text":"We can chase down the enemy."},"1278":{"dur":1,"text":"So they're pretty potent."},"1279":{"dur":3,"text":"Then they don't hit the ship\nlike you see in the movies."},"1282":{"dur":3,"text":"They actually go under,\nand then they detonate."},"1286":{"dur":2,"text":"And what we're doing is\nblowing a hole in the ocean."},"1289":{"dur":0,"text":"Why?"},"1290":{"dur":3,"text":"Because then the ship\nfalls into that hole."},"1293":{"dur":0,"text":"Breaks in half."},"1296":{"dur":2,"text":"And you end up right here."},"1299":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's what sinks the ship."},"1301":{"dur":3,"text":"So these torpedoes\nare big deals."},"1304":{"dur":2,"text":"Here, we're loading\na torpedo in Japan."},"1307":{"dur":2,"text":"Now I was all about\nempowering my team."},"1309":{"dur":2,"text":"I got on this kick of I'm\nnot going to give any orders."},"1312":{"dur":2,"text":"Like what do you think,\nand it was all about that."},"1315":{"dur":2,"text":"I was really good about it, in\nfact I was really bad about it."},"1317":{"dur":3,"text":"Because I did it so well\nthat we were setting up"},"1321":{"dur":3,"text":"to do this and they\nmade a mistake."},"1324":{"dur":1,"text":"And before we did\nit with the torpedo,"},"1325":{"dur":2,"text":"we do it with a shape,\na concrete shape, which"},"1328":{"dur":2,"text":"is the same shape and weight."},"1330":{"dur":2,"text":"But it's inert, and\nwe end up dropping it."},"1333":{"dur":2,"text":"We almost could've\nkilled somebody."},"1335":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was really scared, I\nwas like oh, this is wrong."},"1337":{"dur":1,"text":"This is the wrong\nway to do business."},"1339":{"dur":2,"text":"I need to go back and be\nin control of everything."},"1341":{"dur":1,"text":"But I talked to my\nteam and we said,"},"1342":{"dur":2,"text":"you know what, it's not that."},"1344":{"dur":1,"text":"We're just missing something."},"1346":{"dur":1,"text":"And here's the model\nwe came up with."},"1348":{"dur":3,"text":"We said, I've given\ntoo much control."},"1351":{"dur":2,"text":"I was irresponsibly\ngiving control."},"1354":{"dur":2,"text":"And what I really needed to do\nwas tune the level of control"},"1357":{"dur":4,"text":"to how much they knew about\ntheir jobs and the clarity"},"1361":{"dur":1,"text":"of purpose."},"1362":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the why that\nSimon Sineks talks about."},"1365":{"dur":1,"text":"Because if you say,\nyou get to make"},"1367":{"dur":1,"text":"a decision on which\ncustomer you call,"},"1368":{"dur":3,"text":"you could talk, forget the\nscript, just talk to him."},"1372":{"dur":3,"text":"You need to know what\nwe're trying to achieve."},"1375":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we now say leaders tune."},"1378":{"dur":0,"text":"The word is tune."},"1379":{"dur":2,"text":"We tune the level of control\nand we invite the team"},"1382":{"dur":2,"text":"to higher and higher levels."},"1384":{"dur":1,"text":"So we don't empower teams."},"1386":{"dur":1,"text":"First of all, teams\nare already empowered."},"1388":{"dur":2,"text":"It's inside every human being."},"1391":{"dur":2,"text":"But what we do is we tune\nthe empowerment to the levels"},"1393":{"dur":2,"text":"of competence and control."},"1395":{"dur":2,"text":"Otherwise, it's just\nirresponsibility."},"1397":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, this is Dr. Stephen Covey."},"1399":{"dur":2,"text":"He wrote \"7 Habits of Highly\nEffective People,\" which"},"1402":{"dur":2,"text":"is an awesome book and\nI was a huge Covey fan."},"1404":{"dur":1,"text":"And what happened\non the submarine"},"1406":{"dur":2,"text":"was things started

not giving orders, not\ntelling them what to do."},"1446":{"dur":1,"text":"They're like, what?"},"1447":{"dur":2,"text":"Like, yeah, nevermind."},"1450":{"dur":3,"text":"Because from their paradigm,\nit just didn't work."},"1453":{"dur":2,"text":"But what we had done, I realized\nthat later what we'd done"},"1456":{"dur":3,"text":"is gone from one leader\nand 134
