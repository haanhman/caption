is just"},"1114":{"dur":1,"text":"let your arms hang."},"1115":{"dur":3,"text":"Notice how when your arms\nhang down here just below your"},"1118":{"dur":2,"text":"pockets, that your hands are\nturned

much"},"1211":{"dur":3,"text":"closer to my\nfingers than to my wrist."},"1215":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're gonna\nhave it down here."},"1217":{"dur":5,"text":"Our top hand is gonna feel a lot\nmore

a right-handed golfer\nis going to be your right hand."},"1230":{"dur":4,"text":"So the easiest way of thinking\nabout it is I want to feel like"},"1234":{"dur":3,"text":"my right hand palm is exactly\nwhere I want that club face to"},"1237":{"dur":1,"text":"go."},"1238":{"dur":3,"text":"I want to feel like my right\nhand and the club face are one"},"1242":{"dur":1,"text":"in the

grip and then your lower"},"1275":{"dur":3,"text":"hand feeling that it's looking\nexactly the same place this"},"1278":{"dur":1,"text":"clubface is."},"1280":{"dur":1,"text":"So here we go with

athletic"},"1304":{"dur":1,"text":"stance and athletic set up."},"1306":{"dur":1,"text":"So real easy here."},"1307":{"dur":2,"text":"All we need to do is to get\nour feet about shoulder-width,"},"1310":{"dur":3,"text":"the middle of our\nshoelaces about shoulder width."},"1314":{"dur":2,"text":"Then what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna have just a

about"},"1342":{"dur":3,"text":"the top of my laces, the\nfront of my leg bones."},"1345":{"dur":2,"text":"And that ecnompasses\nan athletic stance."},"1347":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's take a look over

really"},"1355":{"dur":0,"text":"nice."},"1356":{"dur":2,"text":"He's pushed back with\nhis lower stomach muscles."},"1358":{"dur":1,"text":"Real stable in his back."},"1359":{"dur":3,"text":"You

just establishing an"},"1368":{"dur":2,"text":"athletic stance\nand great balance."},"1370":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's have a brief\ndiscussion about motion."},"1373":{"dur":2,"text":"Once you've learned\nto hold the club,"},"1376":{"dur":2,"text":"once you've learned\nto make a stance,"},"1379":{"dur":4,"text":"the next thing you've got to\nbe able to do is to make
