think, you know, just to give you some simple\nexamples."},"62":{"dur":4,"text":"So, for example, one of things I started doing\nwas asking our MRI guys to actually, when"},"67":{"dur":5,"text":"-- on

another thing to say is, yes."},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"There are no -- maybe phenotypes."},"640":{"dur":4,"text":"I think the HPO will probably land at about\n20 or 30,000."},"644":{"dur":4,"text":"But what\u2019s -- hasn\u2019t been discussed yet\nare sort of clusters of phenotypes."},"649":{"dur":4,"text":"And just as an example of how powerful this\nis, three

genes."},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"So, they compared ICD9 codes -- failed."},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"They compared individual HPO terms -- failed."},"668":{"dur":5,"text":"And then they used machine

know, in the combination would really"},"691":{"dur":5,"text":"also give us, you know, 10 to hundreds of\npossible phenotype clusters."},"696":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I mean, I think -- I think the
