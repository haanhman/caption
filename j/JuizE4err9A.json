It's early winter, so it will be interesting to"},"7":{"dur":4,"text":"see what's available but I'm sure there'll be some fantastic produce to use."},"16":{"dur":1,"text":"OK, so I want something sweet for dessert."},"18":{"dur":3,"text":"I was told that here there used to be a glasshouse which was heated from a boiler round the back."},"21":{"dur":3,"text":"They would most certainly would have grown oranges and a lot of other citrus fruits as well."},"25":{"dur":4,"text":"So as a mark of the spirit of the place, to the gardeners that worked so hard to produce that fruit,"},"30":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm going to do a ginger and orange cake.  Really, really good combination. So warming as"},"34":{"dur":2,"text":"well at this time of the year."},"36":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm here in the historic kitchen at\nFlorence Court."},"39":{"dur":4,"text":"I've got self raising flour,  straight into\nthe bowl.  A little bit of bicarbonate of soda,"},"43":{"dur":3,"text":"and then in there we've got a mix of\nspices.  So we've got some cinnamon, we've"},"46":{"dur":2,"text":"got some ground mixed spice, we've got some ginger."},"49":{"dur":3,"text":"Actually there's a lot of ginger.  Really,\nreally powerful."},"52":{"dur":4,"text":"You could cut down on it if you wanted.  And just give that a quick mix round."},"56":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'll just put that to one side and bring in my pan.  I've got some milk."},"59":{"dur":3,"text":"That goes straight into the pan.  I've got soft brown sugar,"},"63":{"dur":3,"text":"and then we've got golden syrup and black treacle.  The next ingredient I'm going to take is"},"66":{"dur":1,"text":"stem ginger in syrup."},"68":{"dur":3,"text":"We're going to keep the syrup because\nwe're going to use that later on."},"71":{"dur":1,"text":"We're just going to take the stem ginger,"},"72":{"dur":4,"text":"and we're going to roughly chop this.

Make sure these are washed,"},"89":{"dur":4,"text":"slightly warm water just to remove any\nwax that might be on them.

It has that kind of idea."},"99":{"dur":4,"text":"As it bakes, the skin will soften down.  It will soak up the sugars and the syrups,"},"103":{"dur":4,"text":"so you end up with almost a candied\norange slice.

These have now cooled down."},"147":{"dur":3,"text":"I need them cold because I'm going to make a frosting now.
