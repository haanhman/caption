said, I'd really like to talk about\novarian cancer."},"132":{"dur":1,"text":"Why was that an important topic?"},"134":{"dur":3,"text":">> Dr. Phillip Dy:\nThe reason why this is important for me and"},"137":{"dur":7,"text":"a lot of cancer specialists, is because there's\nnot a lot of emphasis on cancer of the ovary."},"144":{"dur":7,"text":"We talk about breast cancer very often, lung\ncancer, prostate cancer, but not ovarian cancer."},"151":{"dur":8,"text":"And it's the most-- it's the leading cause\nof gynecological cancer deaths in the country."},"160":{"dur":3,"text":"And we wanted-- I wanted women to know more\nabout what it can present with."},"164":{"dur":3,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nOkay, so not-- if I understand this right,"},"167":{"dur":4,"text":"it's not a lot of women get it but those who\ndo tend to die from it, is that true?"},"172":{"dur":1,"text":">> Dr. Phillip Dy:\nUnfortunately, yes."},"173":{"dur":4,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nOkay, so are rates of it

more of we're trying to diagnosis\nit earlier."},"188":{"dur":1,"text":"But the rates have been the same in the last\n10 years."},"190":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nOkay."},"191":{"dur":1,"text":">> Dr. Phillip Dy:\nBut there's not a lot of knowledge about it,"},"192":{"dur":1,"text":"though."},"193":{"dur":5,"text":"I mean, and we want this to be more open to\nthe public and more research is being done"},"199":{"dur":1,"text":"right now."},"200":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we hope that we can improve the outcome\neven better in the future."},"204":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nOkay."},"205":{"dur":5,"text":"So, what-- who's most at risk in terms of\nmaybe age and then ethnicity and lifestyle?"},"210":{"dur":8,"text":">> Dr. Phillip Dy:\nThe Caucasians are and the white race is more"},"218":{"dur":7,"text":"prone to develop ovarian cancer compared to\nblacks, Hispanics, and other ethnicities."},"226":{"dur":3,"text":"And we're not so sure why but it's mostly\nthe white population."},"230":{"dur":7,"text":"And age, of course, is a big risk factor here."},"237":{"dur":3,"text":"The most common age diagnosis is the median\nage is 63."},"241":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nOkay."},"242":{"dur":2,"text":">> Dr. Phillip Dy:\nAnd most commonly, this is a cancer seen in"},"245":{"dur":2,"text":"age 70 and above."},"247":{"dur":5,"text":"And so, you seldom hear about people developing\novarian cancer who are younger than 50, unless"},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"you have a genetic disposition to the cancer."},"255":{"dur":4,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nOkay, so what kinds of risk factors can lead"},"260":{"dur":1,"text":"to ovarian cancer?"},"261":{"dur":1,"text":"Or do they not know?"},"262":{"dur":1,"text":">> Dr. Phillip Dy:\nOh, there are; there are."},"264":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nOkay."},"265":{"dur":1,"text":">> Dr. Phillip Dy:\nIt's something to do with the hormones."},"266":{"dur":7,"text":"So, studies have shown that the women who\nbecame pregnant the earliest, at the youngest"},"274":{"dur":5,"text":"age like less than 25, and having multiple\npregnancies especially at the younger age,"},"279":{"dur":2,"text":"actually protects you against ovarian cancer."},"282":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nOkay."},"283":{"dur":5,"text":">> Dr. Phillip Dy:\nAnd women, who have never been pregnant or"},"288":{"dur":4,"text":"become pregnant at an older age, are at a\nhigher risk."},"293":{"dur":6,"text":"And it is also funny; studies have shown that\nwomen who take oral contraceptives for a long"},"300":{"dur":5,"text":"time have a 50% lesser chance of developing\ncancer of the ovaries."},"305":{"dur":3,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nOkay, so what is the connection with having"},"309":{"dur":4,"text":"children, lots of them, early versus one later\nin life?"},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"What's the connection between that and the\ncancer?"},"314":{"dur":3,"text":">> Dr. Phillip Dy:\nWhat happens is if a woman becomes pregnant"},"318":{"dur":6,"text":"earlier in life and they have several pregnancies,\nthe menstrual cycle is stopped."},"324":{"dur":5,"text":"And so the hormonal influences are not going\non because during that time of pregnancy,"},"330":{"dur":1,"text":"there's no hormones."},"331":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nSure."},"332":{"dur":2,"text":">> Dr. Phillip Dy:\nOkay, so we feel that there's hormone influence"},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"similar to breast cancer that occurs in ovarian\ncancer as well."},"337":{"dur":2,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nWhich would explain why if you took birth"},"340":{"dur":4,"text":"control for a long time, it kind of has the\nsame effect as being pregnant, but really"},"344":{"dur":1,"text":"not."},"345":{"dur":1,"text":">> Dr. Phillip Dy:\nExactly."},"346":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nSo, what are some of the early symptoms that"},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"women should be aware of or are there none?"},"350":{"dur":2,"text":">> Dr. Phillip Dy:\nYou're very right about that, there's really"},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"no early symptoms for most patients."},"355":{"dur":4,"text":"However, there's a few who are lucky that\nyou can catch it."},"359":{"dur":6,"text":"Most of the symptoms from ovarian cancer are\nmainly due to gastrointestinal or urinary"},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"symptoms, not gynecological."},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"So, a lot of women ignore them."},"371":{"dur":5,"text":"So, for patients who have cancer of the ovaries,\nmost of the time the symptoms will be bloating,"},"376":{"dur":7,"text":"abdominal pain, pelvic pain, urinary frequency,\nor a feeling that every time you eat, you"},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"always get full so fast, that's quite common."},"387":{"dur":4,"text":"And a lot of times, we ignore it because we\nalways think its reflux."},"391":{"dur":4,"text":"And so we tell women that they have to be\nattentive to these things, especially if it's"},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"new and if it's frequent."},"399":{"dur":5,"text":"And a lot of people ask me how frequent; if\nit occurs more than 12 times in a month, these"},"404":{"dur":4,"text":"symptoms, they need to bring this to their\ndoctor's attention and they should not really"},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"stop until they get a satisfactory evaluation."},"411":{"dur":3,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nSo, why is it-- are they-- do you get more"},"415":{"dur":5,"text":"of those symptoms in the abdominal area and\nhave to deal with more of your stomach or"},"420":{"dur":1,"text":"feel like you may have stomach issues?"},"421":{"dur":2,"text":">> Dr. Phillip Dy:\nThe reason for that is because most of the"},"424":{"dur":7,"text":"time when ovarian cancer spreads, unfortunately,\nit goes to the bowel, it causes fluid build"},"431":{"dur":1,"text":"up, and so you're full."},"433":{"dur":5,"text":"And that's the reason why-- so that's why\nwhen patients have these symptoms, 70% of"},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"the time, it's already advanced."},"440":{"dur":3,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nSo, it's kind of like a-- sort of like pancreatic"},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"cancer, you don't know you have it until it's\ntoo late."},"446":{"dur":5,"text":"So, really, you know, we've got, you know,\npap smears and mammograms to detect breast"},"451":{"dur":5,"text":"cancer and things like that, is there really\nany early detection method?"},"456":{"dur":4,"text":">> Dr. Phillip Dy:\nNot in ovarian cancer and that's part of the"},"461":{"dur":6,"text":"reason why most majority of patients are diagnosed\nat advanced age."},"467":{"dur":5,"text":"For the average population, the recommendation\nis not to do any screening because it's not"},"472":{"dur":1,"text":"been shown to help."},"473":{"dur":6,"text":"In fact, there was a large trial a few years\nago, it's called the PLCO trial, Prostate"},"479":{"dur":5,"text":"Lung Colorectal Ovarian cancer trial, that\ndid the screening test, compared patients"},"485":{"dur":6,"text":"who were screened for ovarian cancer with\ncancer marker, CA125 and trans-vaginal ultrasound"},"492":{"dur":1,"text":"versus no screening."},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"Guess what happened?"},"495":{"dur":7,"text":"No difference in outcome for cure, no difference\nin outcome for diagnosing them early and several"},"502":{"dur":5,"text":"women who were screened were subjected to\nunnecessary surgery."},"507":{"dur":5,"text":"So, now a days we don't do screening unless\nthere's a strong family history of ovarian"},"513":{"dur":5,"text":"cancer or they have the genetic mutation for\nBRCA1 or 2."},"518":{"dur":4,"text":"Or something called lynch syndrome, wherein\nthey're at high-risk for ovarian cancer, then"},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"we do the screening for them."},"523":{"dur":2,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nSo, you brought up BRCA1, that's the breast"},"525":{"dur":3,"text":"cancer gene, if you have that are your chances\nof getting ovarian cancer increased, too?"},"529":{"dur":1,"text":">> Dr. Phillip Dy:\nSignificantly."},"530":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nOkay."},"531":{"dur":1,"text":">> Dr. Phillip Dy:\nSo, let me expand on that if I may."},"533":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nSure."},"534":{"dur":5,"text":">> Dr. Phillip Dy:\nSo, there are two kinds of BRCA mutation gene"},"539":{"dur":4,"text":"and the BRCA1 was the first one in chromosome\n17."},"544":{"dur":4,"text":"And if somebody's a carrier for BRCA1, your\nodds of developing cancer of the breast is"},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"as high as 90% lifetime."},"551":{"dur":5,"text":"And as for developing cancer of the ovary,\nit's about 35-50% lifetime."},"557":{"dur":5,"text":"And if you are a BRCA2 mutation carrier, which\nis not as strong, then the odds of developing"},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"ovarian cancer is about 15-20% lifetime."},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"So, you can see the risk."},"567":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, the ordinary population, normal population,\ntheir risk of developing ovarian cancer lifetime"},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"is only 1.4%."},"573":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nOkay."},"574":{"dur":2,"text":">> Dr. Phillip Dy:\nVersus 50% for BRCA1."},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"So, you can imagine it's high."},"579":{"dur":3,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nSo, I understand from my reading on the disease"},"582":{"dur":4,"text":"that if someone is diagnosed with it, just\nlike lung cancer, it's staged."},"587":{"dur":4,"text":"Can you kind of explain the stages and how\nyou might go about treating within the different"},"591":{"dur":1,"text":"stages?"},"592":{"dur":2,"text":">> Dr. Phillip Dy:\nYes, with staging, which would go along with"},"595":{"dur":4,"text":"a treatment, later on we will discuss about\nsurgery; almost always the staging is after"},"600":{"dur":1,"text":"surgery."},"601":{"dur":6,"text":"So, for stage one the outcome's good and of\ncourse, stage four is the worst."},"607":{"dur":4,"text":"For stage one, it means that the cancer is\nlimited to inside the ovaries."},"612":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's very important because when it's\noutside the surface of the ovary, it's really"},"616":{"dur":1,"text":"not stage one, okay?"},"618":{"dur":4,"text":"And in stage one, there's one A, B, and C."},"623":{"dur":6,"text":"For stage one A, which is the earliest stage,\nthe outcome for cure is more than 94%."},"629":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nOkay."},"630":{"dur":2,"text":">> Dr. Phillip Dy:\nI mean, but we rarely see stage one; it's"},"632":{"dur":3,"text":"only 15% of all patients."},"636":{"dur":6,"text":"Stage two means it's gone out of the ovary\nand sometimes outside kind of in the pelvis"},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"area."},"643":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nOkay."},"644":{"dur":3,"text":">> Dr. Phillip Dy:\nThe cure rate drops to about 70-80%."},"648":{"dur":6,"text":"Stage three means there's lymph node involvement\nor it's gone up above the pelvis more to the"},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"abdomen."},"656":{"dur":5,"text":"And in these patients, the cure rate out of\na five-year disease ratio for survival drops"},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"down already to about 40-50%."},"664":{"dur":6,"text":"Stage four means, it's a lot more advance\nmeaning some of them will present with massive"},"671":{"dur":8,"text":"fluid in the lungs, involvement of the liver,\ninvolvement of the spleen and five-year ovary"},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"survival is no more than 15-20%."},"682":{"dur":3,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nDoes this cancer, you kind of talked about"},"685":{"dur":4,"text":"it a little bit earlier, does it have kind\nof a, I don't know, a pattern in which it"},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"spreads?"},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"Does it typically go here and then here and\nhere?"},"693":{"dur":1,"text":"Or does it go anywhere?"},"694":{"dur":2,"text":">> Dr. Phillip Dy:\nYes, that's a very good question."},"696":{"dur":6,"text":"Unlike cancer of the uterus, cancer of the\novary is more predictable."},"702":{"dur":6,"text":"Ovarian cancer typically spreads from the\novary itself, fallopian tube, uterus, and"},"709":{"dur":4,"text":"then the pelvis and then the abdomen before\ngoing to the chest."},"713":{"dur":4,"text":"So, most patients even who have stage four\ngenerally don't have any involvement of the"},"718":{"dur":1,"text":"lungs."},"719":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, on the other hand, uterine cancer it\ncan spread anywhere so quickly because it"},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"decimates mainly by bloodstream."},"726":{"dur":7,"text":"So, now, before I forget, it's very important\nfor the public to know that the grade of the"},"734":{"dur":8,"text":"cancer, meaning how it looks under a microscope,\nit's a very, very important."},"742":{"dur":6,"text":"And so for the staging and when the cancer\nis grade one, it means it's mature looking,"},"749":{"dur":3,"text":"it looks like normal cells and the outcome\nis good."},"753":{"dur":7,"text":"That's why for stage one A and B, generally\nwe don't-- stage one A and B with grade one,"},"760":{"dur":3,"text":"meaning good grade, we don't give chemotherapy\nafter surgery."},"764":{"dur":5,"text":"But if it's aggressive looking, meaning grade\nthree, they really looking very immature cells;"},"769":{"dur":3,"text":"they can behave like stage two and they all\nget chemotherapy."},"773":{"dur":3,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nSo, staging and grading are two different"},"776":{"dur":2,"text":"things, just so we're-- so you're actually\nlooking at two different things."},"779":{"dur":1,"text":">> Dr. Phillip Dy:\nYes."},"780":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nThat leads to my next question."},"781":{"dur":1,"text":"How do-- what's your treatment plan?"},"783":{"dur":5,"text":"How do you go about-- I know it has to depend,\nobviously, on stage and grading but what's"},"789":{"dur":1,"text":"the typical course?"},"790":{"dur":1,"text":">> Dr. Phillip Dy:\nYes."},"791":{"dur":3,"text":"So for, once again, surgery is the first thing."},"795":{"dur":5,"text":"So, it's very important that when a person\nis diagnosed with a pelvic mass and you think"},"800":{"dur":5,"text":"it's ovarian cancer, you need to see the right\nsurgeon."},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"And these surgeons are called gynecological\noncologists."},"809":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nOkay."},"810":{"dur":3,"text":">> Dr. Phillip Dy:\nOkay, studies have shown that these specialists,"},"813":{"dur":4,"text":"these are gynecologists who are trained in\novarian cancer surgery."},"818":{"dur":4,"text":"If they are the ones doing the surgery, the\noutcome for survival-ship is significantly"},"823":{"dur":1,"text":"improved."},"824":{"dur":1,"text":"There's a big difference."},"825":{"dur":4,"text":"And the reason for that is because a surgery\nfor ovarian cancer is very difficult; it's"},"829":{"dur":1,"text":"not easy."},"830":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nOkay, what makes it difficult?"},"831":{"dur":5,"text":">> Dr. Phillip Dy:\nGenerally when they do surgery, it's for diagnosis,"},"836":{"dur":3,"text":"staging and to also give the patient the best\nchance of cure."},"840":{"dur":5,"text":"When you do surgery for ovarian cancer, when\nyou go in there, you need to remove all cancer"},"846":{"dur":2,"text":"that you can see."},"848":{"dur":4,"text":"And typically it starts with removing the\nuterus, removing both ovaries; you have to"},"853":{"dur":1,"text":"remove both, okay?"},"855":{"dur":3,"text":"Unless it's very early stage one, but almost\nalways you still try to remove both because"},"858":{"dur":2,"text":"it can effect the other side later on."},"861":{"dur":4,"text":"And typically you would also remove lymph\nnodes automatically."},"865":{"dur":6,"text":"Plus an area called omentum, which is the\nfatty tissue that surrounds the bowels."},"871":{"dur":4,"text":"And you remove that as well and a lot of times\nyou have to also remove the bowels or bladder"},"876":{"dur":2,"text":"that's affected by the cancer."},"878":{"dur":5,"text":"And also, they also, a lot of times, do biopsies\nof the diaphragm, which is the muscles separating"},"884":{"dur":2,"text":"the lung and below the lung."},"886":{"dur":6,"text":"And if you're not an experienced gynecologist,\nyou cannot do all those things."},"892":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nThere's a lot in there."},"893":{"dur":1,"text":">> Dr. Phillip Dy:\nIt's very difficult."},"895":{"dur":5,"text":"And nowadays, in what we should talk about\nlater on, we do a lot of chemotherapy directly"},"901":{"dur":1,"text":"into the abdominal cavity now."},"903":{"dur":7,"text":"And most of the time, the gynecologist will\nput a port or catheter in the cavity during"},"910":{"dur":1,"text":"surgery."},"911":{"dur":2,"text":"And we then start chemotherapy after recovery."},"913":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nOkay."},"914":{"dur":4,"text":">> Dr. Phillip Dy:\nSo, going back to treatment, with stage one,"},"919":{"dur":7,"text":"if it's stage one and slow growing, and it's\nnot aggressive, no chemotherapy until surgery."},"926":{"dur":4,"text":"But if it's stage one but aggressive, chemotherapy\nfor about three to six cycles, which is every"},"930":{"dur":1,"text":"three weeks."},"932":{"dur":4,"text":"Stage two to stage four, everybody gets chemotherapy\nafter surgery."},"937":{"dur":8,"text":"And the term that we use for surgery it's\ncalled optimal cyto-reduction meaning the"},"946":{"dur":5,"text":"surgeon has to remove everything that he can\nsee and bring down the size of the cancer"},"951":{"dur":2,"text":"to less than one centimeter."},"953":{"dur":5,"text":"So, studies have shown that if it's left above\none centimeter, if you leave the cancer behind"},"959":{"dur":4,"text":"above one centimeter, the cure rate or of\nsurvival significantly drops."},"963":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nSo, it's pretty aggressive if any is left."},"965":{"dur":2,"text":">> Dr. Phillip Dy:\nExactly and that's why you need an experienced"},"967":{"dur":1,"text":"surgeon."},"968":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nOkay."},"969":{"dur":1,"text":">> Dr. Phillip Dy:\nYes, and the studies have shown that for stage"},"971":{"dur":6,"text":"three and stage four, if you are able to do\nthis best surgery, you can give chemotherapy"},"978":{"dur":7,"text":"directly into the abdominal cavity along with\nIV chemotherapy and it can improve survival-ship"},"985":{"dur":3,"text":"almost significantly by several, several months,\nthat's why."},"988":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nDo you ever do radiation?"},"990":{"dur":1,"text":"Or is that not a typical--\n>> Dr. Phillip Dy:"},"992":{"dur":1,"text":"Radiation therapy?"},"993":{"dur":1,"text":"Almost never."},"994":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nOkay, not for that type of cancer."},"995":{"dur":1,"text":">> Dr. Phillip Dy:\nNot for this type of cancer because it's more,"},"996":{"dur":2,"text":"it's more widespread when it occurs so we\ndon't generally do it."},"999":{"dur":2,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nSo, let's talk, I know you brought some new--"},"1002":{"dur":3,"text":"there's always new research, thankfully, and\nnew treatments available."},"1005":{"dur":2,"text":"What's-- What are some of the new trials out\nthere?"},"1007":{"dur":4,"text":">> Dr. Phillip Dy:\nWell, the-- let me just give you a flavor"},"1011":{"dur":1,"text":"here."},"1012":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nOkay."},"1013":{"dur":4,"text":">> Dr. Phillip Dy:\nJust in the last one-year, a few new drugs"},"1017":{"dur":1,"text":"were approved, okay?"},"1019":{"dur":7,"text":"One is the anti-angiogenesis drug called Avastin\nor Bevacizumab, which has been approved for"},"1026":{"dur":4,"text":"different cancers in the past like lung cancer,\ncolon cancer."},"1031":{"dur":6,"text":"What this drug does is that it destroys the\nability of cancer cells to create new blood"},"1038":{"dur":1,"text":"vessels."},"1039":{"dur":4,"text":"So, when you do that there's no nourishment,\nthe cancer cells die, okay?"},"1043":{"dur":5,"text":"So, this drug, which is approved recently,\nto be given along with chemotherapy, and it"},"1048":{"dur":3,"text":"was compared to chemotherapy alone for reoccurring\novarian cancer."},"1051":{"dur":5,"text":"And it was shown to improve the overall outcome."},"1057":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, we're not there yet where it's been shown\nto improve overall survival but it's been"},"1061":{"dur":3,"text":"shown to improve the time wherein the patient\ncan be cancer free."},"1065":{"dur":1,"text":"So, that's one advantage."},"1067":{"dur":2,"text":"The other one is a drug called Olaparib."},"1069":{"dur":4,"text":"Olaparib, these are pills, these are what\nwe call parp inhibitors."},"1074":{"dur":1,"text":">> Lori Casey:\nOkay."},"1075":{"dur":2,"text":">> Dr. Phillip Dy:\nOkay, parp inhibitors-- parp is something"},"1078":{"dur":7,"text":"to do with a DNA system wherein cancer cells\nrely on this parp to do DNA repair so that"},"1085":{"dur":2,"text":"they can recover when they're being
