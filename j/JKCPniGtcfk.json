okay?"},"78":{"dur":4,"text":"So with a set text, you have\na lot of time to read them,"},"83":{"dur":3,"text":"think about them, talk\nabout them in class, okay?"},"87":{"dur":3,"text":"So you know a

the\npaper is now something"},"152":{"dur":1,"text":"we ask you to do."},"154":{"dur":2,"text":"But here's the good news, huh?"},"156":{"dur":3,"text":"My aim is to make it easier for

we,"},"270":{"dur":2,"text":"what is actually meant by a close reading"},"272":{"dur":4,"text":"because I know there is some\nconfusion and some anxiety"},"276":{"dur":3,"text":"about what it is

actually very simple."},"339":{"dur":4,"text":"It's your interpretation of a\ntext, what you think it means."},"345":{"dur":3,"text":"More specifically what that\nmeans is that you have to"},"349":{"dur":3,"text":"identify the text\u2019s version of life."},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"Remember, in this lit course,\nwe're always talking about"},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"texts as a version of life."},"357":{"dur":1,"text":"They're not mirrors or pictures of life,"},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"but they're versions, they're constructs,"},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"they're somebody's ideas, okay?"},"365":{"dur":4,"text":"So what you need to do in\nthis exercise is to identify"},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"the text's issues, the\nissues it's dealing with"},"373":{"dur":3,"text":"and its underlying values,\nbeliefs, attitudes."},"377":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, so it's the text as\na form of representation."},"381":{"dur":4,"text":"Think about that word\nrepresentation, it's re-presentation."},"386":{"dur":3,"text":"It's not presenting life,\nit's re-presenting it."},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"It's giving you a version."},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"But as well as identifying or describing"},"396":{"dur":3,"text":"the text version of life,\nevaluate it as well."},"400":{"dur":3,"text":"Say whether you agree with\nit or disagree with it"},"404":{"dur":4,"text":"or you find certain things in\nit problematic and say why."},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"Markers really like that."},"411":{"dur":3,"text":"Any of you here doing Joseph\nConrad's Heart of Darkness?"},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah, okay, that's a\nwonderful example of a text"},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"that doesn't have a dominant reading."},"420":{"dur":4,"text":"Because on the one hand,\nthat text encourages us"},"425":{"dur":4,"text":"to have sympathy for the black\nAfricans, the black Africans"},"429":{"dur":3,"text":"who were taken as slaves, used as slaves"},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"by the European colonisers."},"435":{"dur":3,"text":"So one way that text\nworks is to ask us to see"},"438":{"dur":3,"text":"that the black Africans\nare victims of exploitation"},"442":{"dur":3,"text":"and greed, okay, but on the other hand,"},"445":{"dur":3,"text":"the text also encourages us\nto think that black Africans"},"449":{"dur":4,"text":"are the symbols of evil of\nwhich we are all capable"},"453":{"dur":4,"text":"once removed from the\nconstraints of civilisation."},"457":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's a profoundly\nracist idea, the idea"},"461":{"dur":3,"text":"that the white man, it's\nusually the man, once removed"},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"from the constraints of civilisation"},"467":{"dur":4,"text":"can do evil and atrocious\nthings, i.e., become black."},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's a very interesting\ntext in that in some ways,"},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"it encourages, it's contradictory."},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"So in a sense, it doesn't\nhave a dominant reading."},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, so there are the\ndifferent ways you can approach"},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"a text, but the point\nis, you've got to show"},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"where your reading comes\nfrom, that you didn't just"},"488":{"dur":3,"text":"pluck it out of the air,\nyou've got to provide evidence"},"492":{"dur":3,"text":"for how you arrived at\nyour interpretation."},"495":{"dur":4,"text":"So whichever approach you\ntake, this is what you must do."},"501":{"dur":4,"text":"You must try and arrive at\nthree main ideas about the text."},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"I think the text means this, this, this."},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"Why three, because that's\nthree body paragraphs."},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"Now if you can come up\nwith more, that's terrific."},"516":{"dur":4,"text":"But three, three main ideas\nis perfectly adequate, okay?"},"520":{"dur":3,"text":"I think markers also\nunderstand that this section"},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"of the paper is different\nfrom the essay section"},"526":{"dur":3,"text":"of the paper in that\nyou're not writing on text"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"that you've already studied in detail."},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"You're writing on something\nyou've never seen before."},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"And markers understand\nthat it's a different kind"},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"of exercise that you're\nprobably not gonna be able to"},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"write as much as you\nwould in the essay section"},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"because you need all that\ntime to read the unseen text"},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"at least, well, a couple of times."},"549":{"dur":3,"text":"And they also don't expect\nin a sense the same polish"},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"that they would in the essay section."},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"But yeah, try and come\nup with three main ideas"},"558":{"dur":4,"text":"and that each idea is the\nbasis of a body paragraph."},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"What you should also do, and\nthis is crucial, of course,"},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"is that you must show your\nmarker how you arrived"},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"at your reading, what made\nyou think that the text means"},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"this, this, and this, okay?"},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"And most importantly, you show\nyour marker how you arrived"},"579":{"dur":4,"text":"at your reading by analysing\nhow the text is written."},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"That's where you get most of your marks."},"586":{"dur":3,"text":"That's why it's called a close reading."},"590":{"dur":4,"text":"You're looking very closely\nat how the text is written."},"594":{"dur":3,"text":"So say for example in the\nhandout that you were all given"},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"as you came through the door,\nwe're not gonna have time"},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"to look at this in any\ndetail, but it's for you"},"603":{"dur":3,"text":"to take home and look at at your leisure."},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"But in that handout I gave\nyou, there's a poem called"},"609":{"dur":4,"text":"Skirt Machinist, and one point\nI could make about that poem"},"614":{"dur":3,"text":"is it encourages us to feel sorry for"},"618":{"dur":4,"text":"a female factory worker,\na working class woman,"},"622":{"dur":3,"text":"and it encourages us to feel sorry for her"},"625":{"dur":4,"text":"because she's powerless,\nhelpless, malnourished,"},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"has no opportunities in life and so on."},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"And one of the things I\nwould do if I was doing"},"635":{"dur":4,"text":"a reading of that is look very\nclosely at how it's written."},"640":{"dur":4,"text":"And one important aspect of\nthat poem is that it uses"},"644":{"dur":4,"text":"the persona of a working\nclass woman, factory worker."},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'd talk about the\npersona and how the use of"},"652":{"dur":4,"text":"the persona, how that shapes\nmy response to the poem."},"657":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, so you show your\nmarker how you've arrived at"},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"your reading, concentrating\non how the text is written."},"664":{"dur":4,"text":"And you also, as I said\nearlier, evaluate your reading."},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"Sorry, evaluate the text\nversion of life, so do you agree"},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"with it or disagree with it and why?"},"676":{"dur":4,"text":"So I'll give you a striking\nexample of how a reader"},"681":{"dur":3,"text":"disagreed with the ideas of this poem."},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"'Cause as I said, the poem\nencourages you to feel sorry"},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"for the female factory\nworker, this poor, helpless,"},"693":{"dur":3,"text":"degraded woman stuck in a menial job."},"699":{"dur":4,"text":"And I had a student who said\nthat he didn't feel sorry."},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"He disagreed with the\npoem's attempt to make you"},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"feel sorry for this woman."},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"He didn't feel sorry for\nthis woman in the poem"},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"because he believed that if you're poor,"},"715":{"dur":3,"text":"it's your own fault, at which\npoint I thought there are"},"718":{"dur":1,"text":"so many things wrong with that statement,"},"720":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm not quite where to start."},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"But that was a good example\nof someone, if you like,"},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"disagreeing with a text."},"729":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's an extreme example,\nbut it nevertheless shows you"},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"that you don't have to\nagree with what a text"},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"is telling you to think."},"739":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay, now this is a technique\nthat I've used over the years"},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"and which many students have found useful."},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can use this as a plan."},"749":{"dur":1,"text":"You make a table, yep."},"752":{"dur":4,"text":"So it shows you very\nclearly what you have to do."},"757":{"dur":4,"text":"So use this as a plan when\nyou're writing on an unseen text."},"761":{"dur":4,"text":"Now you see in the left-hand\ncolumn it says my reading,"},"766":{"dur":3,"text":"and that's where you would\nwrite down three points,"},"769":{"dur":3,"text":"I think the text means\nthis, this, and this."},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, and the other three\ncolumns are all about showing"},"776":{"dur":4,"text":"your marker how you arrived\nat that reading, okay?"},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"What made you think the text\nmeans this, this, and this."},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"And the second column, and\nit's got four asterisks"},"788":{"dur":3,"text":"'cause this is the most\nimportant part of the exercise."},"791":{"dur":4,"text":"The second column is you\ndiscuss how the text is written,"},"796":{"dur":3,"text":"because how the text is\nwritten is a major factor"},"799":{"dur":4,"text":"in influencing your\ninterpretation of the text."},"803":{"dur":3,"text":"So does it use symbolism,\nimagery, does it have a persona?"},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"What's the point of view of the text?"},"809":{"dur":3,"text":"Does it use metaphors or whatever?"},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"The next column, writer's context."},"816":{"dur":1,"text":"You show your marker that you've arrived"},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"at a certain reading\nbecause you understand"},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"the significance of the text context."},"823":{"dur":2,"text":"What you're showing your marker\nthere is that you understand"},"826":{"dur":3,"text":"that texts don't exist in a\nkind of social and historical"},"830":{"dur":3,"text":"vacuum, that texts are\nalways influenced by"},"834":{"dur":3,"text":"the dominant ideas and values\nof the historical period"},"837":{"dur":2,"text":"and society in which\nthey were written, okay?"},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"Now can I just say here\nagain by way of reassurance,"},"843":{"dur":3,"text":"if you don't know the\nsignificance of the text context,"},"847":{"dur":1,"text":"don't fret about it."},"849":{"dur":3,"text":"So for example, this poem\nhere was written in the 1920s,"},"852":{"dur":1,"text":"1920s Australia."},"854":{"dur":3,"text":"If you don't know what was\nhappening in 1920s Australia,"},"858":{"dur":3,"text":"if you don't know about the\ndominant ideas and values"},"862":{"dur":3,"text":"at the time, don't fret,\nbecause markers understand"},"865":{"dur":4,"text":"that this is a literature\nexam, not a history exam."},"869":{"dur":2,"text":"But if you do know it, if you\ndo know what was happening"},"871":{"dur":2,"text":"1920s Australia that's\nrelevant to that poem,"},"874":{"dur":3,"text":"by all means, add it in to your argument."},"877":{"dur":4,"text":"Having said that markers\nunderstand that this isn't"},"881":{"dur":2,"text":"a history exam, I think it's\nalso reasonable to assume"},"884":{"dur":1,"text":"that there are certain periods of history"},"886":{"dur":1,"text":"that you will know something about."},"888":{"dur":3,"text":"So 1930s Depression, the two World Wars,"},"891":{"dur":4,"text":"1960s, a period of great\nsocial change, feminism,"},"896":{"dur":3,"text":"civil rights movement, the\npeace movement and so on."},"899":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, now the final\ncolumn, reader's context."},"904":{"dur":4,"text":"Who you are as a reader\nreally matters, all right?"},"910":{"dur":2,"text":"And what you're doing is\nshowing your marker that reading"},"913":{"dur":4,"text":"is always, it's not a\nneutral or objective process."},"918":{"dur":2,"text":"But it's you doing the reading."},"921":{"dur":4,"text":"It's not just some impersonal\nanonymous person, it's you."},"928":{"dur":2,"text":"But there are different\nways, as I said earlier,"},"930":{"dur":2,"text":"that you can talk about you."},"933":{"dur":4,"text":"So for example if you are doing\na personal context response,"},"940":{"dur":3,"text":"the two most important\nthings about you as a reader"},"943":{"dur":4,"text":"are always going to be your\nvalues and your beliefs,"},"948":{"dur":4,"text":"what you value and what\nyou believe to be true."},"952":{"dur":3,"text":"The fact that for example\nyou're male or female"},"955":{"dur":4,"text":"is not really telling us very\nmuch because males as a group"},"960":{"dur":4,"text":"and females as a group value and believe"},"964":{"dur":1,"text":"many different things."},"966":{"dur":3,"text":"So without knowing Kim\nKardashian personally,"},"969":{"dur":3,"text":"and I'm very grateful\nfor that, I'm convinced,"},"972":{"dur":2,"text":"well, I'm pretty sure\nthat her values would be"},"974":{"dur":4,"text":"very different from say the\nvalues of Mother Teresa, okay?"},"979":{"dur":3,"text":"So, it's hard to imagine, isn't it?"},"982":{"dur":3,"text":"Anyway, but other things\nthat might influence,"},"987":{"dur":2,"text":"so sorry, go back to the poem."},"990":{"dur":2,"text":"If I was writing on this\npoem, I might simply say,"},"993":{"dur":3,"text":"well, as someone who\nvalues class equality,"},"997":{"dur":4,"text":"I was influenced to sympathise\nwith this working class woman"},"1002":{"dur":2,"text":"as a victim of, et cetera, okay?"},"1005":{"dur":3,"text":"Or as someone who believes\nthat class inequality"},"1009":{"dur":1,"text":"is unfair, whatever."},"1011":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, so I'm stating what\nmy values and beliefs are"},"1015":{"dur":3,"text":"and how they've influenced\nmy response to the text."},"1018":{"dur":2,"text":"But there are other things\nabout you as a reader"},"1021":{"dur":3,"text":"that might be relevant\nto the particular text"},"1025":{"dur":1,"text":"you're writing on."},"1026":{"dur":1,"text":"It might be your age, it could be the race"},"1028":{"dur":3,"text":"to which you belong, the\nclass to which you belong."},"1031":{"dur":1,"text":"It could be your culture,"},"1032":{"dur":3,"text":"it could be your historical context."},"1036":{"dur":3,"text":"So this poem written in\nthe 1920s, for example,"},"1040":{"dur":2,"text":"you're reading it a hundred\nyears after it was written."},"1042":{"dur":2,"text":"How does that influence the way you read?"},"1045":{"dur":3,"text":"It could be something\nyou've, your prior reading,"},"1048":{"dur":2,"text":"something you've already read, okay?"},"1051":{"dur":2,"text":"Has anyone done the Great Gatsby?"},"1053":{"dur":3,"text":"Yeah, that would be a great\nnovel to bring to bear"},"1057":{"dur":2,"text":"on your reading of this one\nbecause the Great Gatsby,"},"1060":{"dur":3,"text":"also written and set\nin the 1920s, shows you"},"1065":{"dur":3,"text":"that it was a period of\ngreat economic prosperity,"},"1069":{"dur":4,"text":"but also a period of great\neconomic and social inequality."},"1073":{"dur":3,"text":"And so you could use your\nunderstanding of that text"},"1076":{"dur":3,"text":"as a way of saying, well,\nyou know, that's helped me"},"1079":{"dur":3,"text":"understand the ideas of this poem."},"1083":{"dur":3,"text":"You as a reader, it might\nalso be the reading practice"},"1086":{"dur":1,"text":"that you employ."},"1089":{"dur":2,"text":"So you're gonna, for\nexample, use a Marxist"},"1091":{"dur":2,"text":"reading practice on this poem."},"1094":{"dur":3,"text":"But whatever approach you\nchoose to take, and you wouldn't"},"1098":{"dur":3,"text":"do all of those things, not by any means."},"1101":{"dur":3,"text":"If you're gonna do a personal context one,"},"1104":{"dur":3,"text":"personal context response, focus\non your values and beliefs."},"1108":{"dur":3,"text":"Or you could use one reading practice."},"1111":{"dur":3,"text":"So you'd only do one or two\nof those things on that
