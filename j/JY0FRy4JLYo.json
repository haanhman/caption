all\nthat effort away."},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"The thing you'll notice\nabout the locust as well,"},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"is that not only do the\nlocust descend and

chaos"},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"for the average poor person?"},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"The book brings forth\nreally three surprises,"},"676":{"dur":1,"text":"and then one thing\nthat's not so surprising."},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"The first surprise\nis to realize, oh,"},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"all of these law enforcement\nsystems in the developing"},"682":{"dur":3,"text":"world, they were never\ndesigned to stop crime."},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"They were never designed to\nprotect the common poor person"},"688":{"dur":0,"text":"from violence."},"689":{"dur":3,"text":"They were set up by colonial\npowers over the first stage"},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"of the 20th century in order\nto protect the government"},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"from the common people."},"698":{"dur":3,"text":"And they've never been\nre-engineered to actually"},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"enforce the law."},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"And as a result, poor people\nin the developing world"},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"now have great laws."},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"This tremendous human rights\nrevolution over the last 50"},"708":{"dur":3,"text":"years has embedded great\nlaws in these countries."},"712":{"dur":1,"text":"But what they don't\nhave is law enforcement."},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"And it turns out that\nthat really matters."},"716":{"dur":1,"text":"And mostly because\nthey've been saddled"},"717":{"dur":1,"text":"with these colonial\nsystems of law enforcement"},"719":{"dur":1,"text":"that have never\nbeen re-engineered."},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"The second reason\nyou find out is"},"723":{"dur":3,"text":"that there's been a massive\nprivatization of security"},"726":{"dur":1,"text":"in the developing world."},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you've been traveling in\nthe developing world at all,"},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"you'll sort of maybe notice,\nespecially in your first visit"},"733":{"dur":1,"text":"there, like almost\neverywhere I go"},"734":{"dur":1,"text":"somebody's got a\ngun guarding us."},"735":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, he's at the\nrestaurant, at the hotel,"},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"they're at the whatever sort\nof commercial enterprise."},"742":{"dur":4,"text":"There are just people\nproviding physical protection"},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"I was at the World\nEconomic Forum at Davos"},"749":{"dur":3,"text":"a few years ago with a\nnumber of corporate leaders"},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"who have massive investments\nin the developing"},"755":{"dur":3,"text":"world, huge\nfacilities, thousands"},"759":{"dur":1,"text":"and thousands of employees."},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"And I just asked with all this\nviolence in the developing"},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"world that we're aware of,\nlike how do you guys protect"},"765":{"dur":1,"text":"your people and your property?"},"767":{"dur":1,"text":"And they all kind of\nlook at each other,"},"768":{"dur":2,"text":"and they actually almost\nanswer in unison to say,"},"771":{"dur":1,"text":"we pay for it."},"773":{"dur":1,"text":"But if you think\nabout this, it's"},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"one thing if those with\nwealth and influence"},"778":{"dur":3,"text":"leave the public school and the\npublic school kind of gets bad."},"782":{"dur":3,"text":"Or you leave the public\ntransportation system,"},"785":{"dur":1,"text":"and the buses\nbecome not so great."},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"But what happens when the\npeople of wealth and power"},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"abandon the public\njustice system?"},"791":{"dur":1,"text":"When the basic law\nenforcement system"},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"is allowed to get worse,\nand worse, and worse?"},"796":{"dur":1,"text":"That is the reality in\nthe developing world."},"798":{"dur":1,"text":"And part of the\nreason it stayed off"},"799":{"dur":3,"text":"the radar screen of\neverybody is that the sector"},"803":{"dur":4,"text":"of wealthy folks in the\ndeveloping world from whom"},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"the economic growth\nis coming from,"},"810":{"dur":1,"text":"have been able to\nsecure themselves"},"812":{"dur":1,"text":"with private security."},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"And so now, in the aggregate,\nif you look at that country,"},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"it produces a decent\nrate of economic growth."},"818":{"dur":3,"text":"But for people who are living\noff, let's say, $2 a day,"},"822":{"dur":3,"text":"that's about more\nthan 2 billion people,"},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"those folks can afford to\nbe safe and so they're not."},"832":{"dur":1,"text":"The third other\nsurprising reason"},"833":{"dur":2,"text":"behind sort of the\nbrokenness of law enforcement"},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"is it's just not been the\nsubject of our investment."},"838":{"dur":2,"text":"We've poured trillions of\ndollars over the last 50 years"},"841":{"dur":3,"text":"into food systems, water\nsystems, public health systems,"},"844":{"dur":2,"text":"all totally vital, and\nactually we haven't necessarily"},"847":{"dur":2,"text":"spent enough on trying\nto engage those systems,"},"849":{"dur":3,"text":"because the poor need\nall of those things."},"852":{"dur":4,"text":"But we can't find even 1% of\nall that expenditure and effort"},"857":{"dur":3,"text":"over the last 50 years that has\ngone to building public justice"},"861":{"dur":2,"text":"systems that will actually\nprotect the poor from violence."},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"So the third surprise is to\nsay, oh, we haven't actually"},"866":{"dur":3,"text":"really tried all that hard\nto address this problem yet."},"869":{"dur":3,"text":"The fourth explanation is\nless surprising, perhaps,"},"872":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's just\nthe idea that there"},"874":{"dur":2,"text":"are people in power in\nthe developing world who"},"877":{"dur":2,"text":"have figured out how to\nsucceed in the absence"},"880":{"dur":1,"text":"of public justice, right?"},"881":{"dur":2,"text":"And so they now actually\nwould feel quite threatened"},"884":{"dur":3,"text":"if justice systems actually\nstarted working in the way"},"888":{"dur":1,"text":"that they should."},"889":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's the\ndiagnosis that we're"},"891":{"dur":1,"text":"trying to make here in\n\"The Locust
