really"},"320":{"dur":3,"text":"unsafe, ineffective solutions."},"324":{"dur":2,"text":"From there, we went to\nthe observe phase."},"326":{"dur":2,"text":"So we went across the length and\nbreadth of India talking"},"329":{"dur":3,"text":"to mothers, midwives, doctors,\ncommunity health care workers,"},"332":{"dur":4,"text":"trying to understand the\nroot of the problem."},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"And we heard stories\nlike this."},"339":{"dur":1,"text":"This is a woman that\nI met on one of my"},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"first visits to

on research\nlike this that we"},"473":{"dur":3,"text":"realized the problem wasn't\nserving doctors"},"477":{"dur":1,"text":"and big city hospitals."},"479":{"dur":3,"text":"We needed a product that

90%."},"489":{"dur":4,"text":"And so we defined the problem,\nand thought about the user as"},"493":{"dur":3,"text":"a desperate parent in a remote\nvillage without resources to"},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"access a major hospital with\nthe need being the means to"},"501":{"dur":4,"text":"give their dying baby\na chance to survive."},"505":{"dur":5,"text":"And so with that, we realized\nthat we needed a product that"},"511":{"dur":3,"text":"could work without a constant\nsupply of electricity, that"},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"has no moving parts, that is\nportable, that's safe and"},"518":{"dur":3,"text":"intuitive to use so even a\nmother or midwife could use"},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"it, and something that would\nallow for close mother to"},"524":{"dur":0,"text":"child interaction."},"525":{"dur":1,"text":"So we begin prototyping."},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"You can see all the different\nideas we had, ranging from a"},"529":{"dur":4,"text":"hot water incubator to a tent\nlike device to a maternity"},"533":{"dur":4,"text":"vest that my colleague Linus\nis nicely modeling here."},"538":{"dur":4,"text":"And the idea that we like the\nbest that fit our criteria

temperature."},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'll show you the final\ndevice and then some of the"},"555":{"dur":3,"text":"evolution of getting\nto that point."},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is the Embrace Nest."},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"As you can see, it looks\nlike a little"},"562":{"dur":1,"text":"sleeping bag for a baby."},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"It's made out of entirely\nwaterproof

can heat this either with\nboiling water or with an"},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"electric heater."},"582":{"dur":3,"text":"But the key is once melted,\nit stays at the exact same"},"585":{"dur":3,"text":"temperature for up to eight\nhours at a time, after which"},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"you can simply reheat it."},"590":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'll pass this around."},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"And it looks like a very\nsimple device, but it's"},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"actually taken hundreds\nof iterations"},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"to get to this point."},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the very first\nprototype--"},"610":{"dur":3,"text":"very cliche, but the drawings\nare on the back of a napkin,"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"and we used margarine\nto prototype."},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"It has very similar qualities\nto the wax."},"619":{"dur":4,"text":"And then the first renditions\nof this, we actually had a"},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"product-- we just went to a\nSalvation Army, found all the"},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"relevant baby gear, and the\nvery first version of the"},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"product actually has a tube\nrunning through it that you"},"633":{"dur":3,"text":"pour boiling water into\nthat melts the wax."},"636":{"dur":3,"text":"And then someone said to us,\nit's probably not a good idea"},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"to boiling water right next to\nthe baby's head, so we quickly"},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"scrapped that idea."},"644":{"dur":4,"text":"Then we went to a second\nversion here."},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"We realized that babies in these\ncountries don't wear"},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"diapers, so we needed something\nthat was really easy"},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"to clean and that\nwas waterproof."},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"This is where we started moving\nto those materials."},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to skip a\nfew of these here."},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"This one's really interesting,\nbecause initially we had it"},"662":{"dur":3,"text":"such that the wax would just sit\nright inside the sleeping"},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"bag and the baby would\nlie on top of that."},"668":{"dur":3,"text":"The wax is food grade, it's\ncompletely nontoxic, that"},"671":{"dur":1,"text":"would be totally safe."},"673":{"dur":3,"text":"But there is this perception\nof fear from mothers of the"},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"wax leaking onto the baby, and\nso that led us to create a"},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"separate compartment that you\nsee in this current edition"},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"where the wax sits."},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"Because cleanliness is so\ncritical-- you don't want"},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"cross infection across\nbabies--"},"689":{"dur":3,"text":"we created this sleeping bag out\nof one piece of fabric, so"},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"there are almost no seams\nin there, so dirt"},"696":{"dur":3,"text":"can't collect inside."},"699":{"dur":3,"text":"You see a little plastic window\nin the front there This"},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"is something doctors were\nrequesting, because they"},"705":{"dur":3,"text":"wanted to monitor the baby's\nbreathing and color, and so we"},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"added that in."},"711":{"dur":1,"text":"This is a picture of\nmy nephew that I"},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"stuffed into the device."},"715":{"dur":3,"text":"We show it, because user testing\nis key, so use your"},"718":{"dur":3,"text":"family members if necessary."},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is an interesting\nstory."},"723":{"dur":3,"text":"So on the wax pouch, what you'll\nsee is a temperature"},"726":{"dur":4,"text":"indicator that tells you when\nthe pouch needs to be reheated"},"731":{"dur":1,"text":"or when it's too cold\nor too hot."},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"And initially we had a numeric\nscale going from about 30 to"},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"40 degrees Celsius."},"737":{"dur":3,"text":"But as we went in villages and\ntested this, mothers would say"},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"to us we don't trust\nWestern medicine."},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"If you give me a certain dosage\nof medicine to give to"},"746":{"dur":3,"text":"my baby, I'll cut in half\nbecause it's too strong."},"749":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you told me to keep this\nat 37 degrees Celsius, I'll"},"753":{"dur":1,"text":"keep it at a little less\nthan that, because it's"},"755":{"dur":1,"text":"probably too warm."},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's something we certainly\ndidn't expect to hear sitting"},"759":{"dur":1,"text":"in Palo Alto."},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"But that led us to this version\nof the design, which"},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"is a happy face,\nfrowning face."},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"And now it's just simply\na OK, not OK."},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"So, just really simple cultural\nnuances have had a"},"771":{"dur":3,"text":"huge impact on the way we've\ngone about designing the"},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"device and making it\nreally locally"},"777":{"dur":3,"text":"appropriate to these markets."},"780":{"dur":1,"text":"And from there, we\nwent to testing."},"782":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is the very first low\nbirth weight baby Nisha that"},"786":{"dur":1,"text":"was placed in the

spot on."},"1547":{"dur":5,"text":"What we're worried about is if\nit's a local copycat, it's"},"1553":{"dur":2,"text":"very likely that it will be\na low quality product."},"1555":{"dur":3,"text":"We actually take a lot of care\nto do the manufacturing in a"},"1559":{"dur":2,"text":"very rigorous and safe way,\nas I said, that meets"},"1561":{"dur":0,"text":"international

hurting babies, that"},"1575":{"dur":3,"text":"will just kill this entire\ncategory of devices."},"1578":{"dur":4,"text":"I think the other aspect of this\nis also we rely on

buy in has not"},"1809":{"dur":1,"text":"been so difficult."},"1811":{"dur":3,"text":"I think, however, this is a new\nconcept and a lot of what"},"1814":{"dur":2,"text":"we're doing now is around\nthinking through how do we"},"1817":{"dur":2,"text":"effect behavior change?"},"1819":{"dur":2,"text":"Just because something is needed\nas demonstrated by the"},"1822":{"dur":2,"text":"number
