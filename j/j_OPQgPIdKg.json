one"},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"that has been such a source\nof trouble to us."},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"And that is all of our conscious states"},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"have this qualitative character to

position, so far,\nto build a conscious machine."},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, another feature of consciousness"},"539":{"dur":3,"text":"is that it comes\nin unified conscious

from the fact"},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"that we don't know\nhow to make a conscious robot,"},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"so we don't have a machine\nthat can do this kind of thing."},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"The next feature of consciousness"},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"after this marvelous,\nunified conscious field"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"is that it functions causally\nin our behavior."},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"I gave you a scientific demonstration\nby raising my hand,"},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"but how is that possible?"},"585":{"dur":3,"text":"How can it be\nthat this

answer,"},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"but we know the basic part of the answer--"},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"and that is there are sequences\nof neuron firings"},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"and they

I've already answered that"},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't think we need to worry about that."},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"But the second one,\nhad an incredible influence"},"681":{"dur":1,"text":"and may still be around,\nand that is"},"682":{"dur":3,"text":"if consciousness exists,\nit's really something else;"},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"it's really a digital computer

program."},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, we know that that's wrong."},"701":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, anybody who's thought\nabout computers at all"},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"can see that that's wrong."},"706":{"dur":3,"text":"Because computation is defined\nas symbol manipulation,"},"709":{"dur":3,"text":"usually thought as 0s and 1s,\nbut any symbols will do."},"712":{"dur":1,"text":"You get an algorithm"},"714":{"dur":5,"text":"that you can program in a binary code"},"719":{"dur":4,"text":"and that's the defining trait\nof the computer program."},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"But we know that's purely syntactical,\nthat's symbolic,"},"728":{"dur":3,"text":"we know that actual human consciousness"},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"has something more than that,\nit's got a content,"},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"in addition to the syntax,\nit's got a semantics."},"736":{"dur":1,"text":"I made that argument,"},"738":{"dur":2,"text":"--oh, my god!\nI don't want to think about

argument\nbriefly, and that is:"},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"consciousness creates an observer\nindependent reality."},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"It creates a reality of money,\nproperty,

only absolute phenomenon."},"803":{"dur":1,"text":"All the rest is interpreted by us."},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"Computation only exists\nrelative to consciousness."},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"Either a

interpretation."},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"That doesn't mean\ncomputation is arbitrary,"},"819":{"dur":2,"text":"I spent a lot of money\non this hardware,"},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"but we have this

subjectivity"},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"as features of claims."},"832":{"dur":3,"text":"And the bottom line\nof this part of my talk, is this:"},"835":{"dur":3,"text":"you can have\na completely
