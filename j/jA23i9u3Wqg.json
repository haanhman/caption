The first Washington\nof George Washington's branch to arrive in"},"1236":{"dur":6,"text":"the colonies in North America was John Washington,\nhis great grandfather, who arrived in"},"1243":{"dur":7,"text":"1656.

He had no intention of"},"1288":{"dur":5,"text":"staying in Virginia. Well, his ship sank.\nHe loaded it up with tobacco and ready to"},"1294":{"dur":3,"text":"go\nback to Virginia, the storm came in and it"},"1297":{"dur":7,"text":"foundered. So John exhibited a couple of the\ntraits that would pass down through his family."},"1305":{"dur":5,"text":"One was a quick adaptability. He's\nfaced with a disaster, how is he going to"},"1310":{"dur":6,"text":"adapt? The other one is that Washington is\ngood at marrying the right women. Really good"},"1317":{"dur":4,"text":"at that.\nSo John Washington marries a woman who is"},"1321":{"dur":7,"text":"an heiress from the Virginia gentry,\nwho has quite a substantial inheritance, quite"},"1328":{"dur":6,"text":"a substantial dowry, and she's also a\ngreat partner for him. And they get married"},"1335":{"dur":6,"text":"and he decides to stay in Virginia and he\nbuilds up his estate. He grows. He purchases"},"1341":{"dur":7,"text":"more land. He begins to diversify. He\nbegins to expand and become a more substantial"},"1348":{"dur":5,"text":"planter. He dies young. He's only 38\nyears old when he dies.

We tend to see Augustine as a"},"1389":{"dur":6,"text":"very loving and paternal figure who\ntragically died when George was only 11 years"},"1396":{"dur":9,"text":"old. Augustine was more than that. He\nwas a very savvy businessman. He, too, expanded"},"1405":{"dur":6,"text":"his land holdings dramatically. He\ncontinued to work with tobacco, but he decided"},"1412":{"dur":8,"text":"to get into ironwork. There's something\ncalled the Principia ironwork. Somebody discovered"},"1420":{"dur":6,"text":"some excellent land for developing\niron foundries. What Augustine did was bought"},"1426":{"dur":5,"text":"up all the surrounding land and began to\ndevelop an industry in connection with some"},"1432":{"dur":4,"text":"English partners and became very prosperous\nthrough that."},"1436":{"dur":8,"text":"Now, his first wife died young, left him a\nson named Lawrence. And Augustine"},"1444":{"dur":8,"text":"had to find a woman for his second wife. And\nhe settled upon -- and, of course, she"},"1452":{"dur":9,"text":"settled upon him -- Mary Ball, to become Mary\nBall Washington. And she is one of the"},"1462":{"dur":6,"text":"most under-appreciated women in American history.\nFor a lot of different reasons. And"},"1468":{"dur":4,"text":"she's really under-appreciated in George Washington's\nlife. Her first born son was"},"1473":{"dur":9,"text":"George, George Washington born in 1732.\nNow, Augustine and Mary Ball were excellent"},"1483":{"dur":5,"text":"partners. And one of the things\nthat Augustine liked about Mary was that she"},"1488":{"dur":7,"text":"was a strong woman, she was dedicated. She\nwas very intelligent, and she knew how to"},"1495":{"dur":7,"text":"run an estate. She knew how to manage a\nbusiness.

This was one"},"1524":{"dur":6,"text":"tough lady and one very smart lady, and, yeah,\nshe's come to us -- we tend to see,"},"1530":{"dur":4,"text":"because George didn't like her later in his\nlife, he had problems with her, we think she"},"1535":{"dur":8,"text":"must have been bad. She wasn't. She raised\nGeorge, particularly after Augustine died"},"1543":{"dur":6,"text":"when, like many Washingtons, he died young.\nAugustine died when George was only 11"},"1550":{"dur":7,"text":"years old. Now, there's been some debate,\nwould George have gone off to England for"},"1558":{"dur":4,"text":"his\nschooling like many young men did if Augustine"},"1562":{"dur":4,"text":"had not died?\nWe're not sure, but we know for certain that"},"1566":{"dur":3,"text":"once Augustine died there was no\nchance of his being sent to England. He had"},"1570":{"dur":8,"text":"to stay in Virginia. Nor did Mary feel\nthey could afford to give him a formal education,"},"1578":{"dur":6,"text":"and George would lament that later on\nin his life. But what he got from Mary, who"},"1584":{"dur":6,"text":"directed his education and from his tutors,\nwas a very practical education. It was based"},"1591":{"dur":7,"text":"on things like geometry, and mathematics,\nand accounting, with a little bit of classics,"},"1599":{"dur":5,"text":"a little bit of liberal arts on the side,\nbut her attitude was, George, you need to"},"1604":{"dur":7,"text":"learn how to manage this estate. It's going\nto come down to you eventually someday. And"},"1611":{"dur":5,"text":"you're going to need to grow and you're\ngoing to need to build your estate."},"1617":{"dur":5,"text":"So his education was very practical, but there\nwere also some fundamental"},"1622":{"dur":10,"text":"principles that he got from his mother. They\nwere things like thrift and diligence and"},"1632":{"dur":4,"text":"almost fanatical accounting and record keeping,\nwhich George kind of liked anyway,"},"1636":{"dur":5,"text":"because he was a detailed guy. If you look\nat early school exercises, he was the type"},"1641":{"dur":5,"text":"of guy if you gave him a dictionary or almanac\nhe would find it immensely fascinating"},"1647":{"dur":5,"text":"and would pore over it and learn more about\nit. He liked to keep records."},"1653":{"dur":7,"text":"She also taught him an absolute horror of\ndebt. And I like to say that among"},"1661":{"dur":8,"text":"the things that Washington feared and detested\nmost in his life were Thomas Jefferson"},"1669":{"dur":5,"text":"and debt.\nMaybe Tom came first. I'm not sure. Especially"},"1675":{"dur":6,"text":"later on in his life. But\nearly on in his life, debt was the main fear."},"1681":{"dur":7,"text":"Now, George, when he's a teenager, he's a\ndreamer, he's like a lot of young"},"1688":{"dur":7,"text":"men.
