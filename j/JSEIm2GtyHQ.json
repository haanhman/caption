So we"},"917":{"dur":4,"text":"ought to at least repay school districts and\nhold them harmless on the interest if that's"},"922":{"dur":4,"text":"possible and then lay out a firm schedule\nthat we stick to to repay the full amount."},"927":{"dur":5,"text":"Mark Dayton: Well the reality is you know\nwe face a projected 6 billion dollar deficit"},"933":{"dur":5,"text":"for the next biennium.
