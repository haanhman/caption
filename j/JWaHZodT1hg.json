dynamic,"},"189":{"dur":2,"text":"if you actually start peeling beneath it."},"191":{"dur":3,"text":"And so you could look at any sort of\ncomponent within your organization

a digital guy,\nto put e-commerce there."},"213":{"dur":4,"text":"But e-commerce to me feels really old\nafter 15, 20 years of it being in market."},"218":{"dur":2,"text":"And I also think that

conversions,"},"241":{"dur":2,"text":"as my friend Avinash Kaushik\nwho's the analytics or"},"243":{"dur":3,"text":"digital marketing evangelist at Google,\na friend of mine talks about."},"247":{"dur":1,"text":"And if you look at things like,"},"248":{"dur":2,"text":"what are my micro-conversions that\nactually lead to that macro-conversion?"},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"They buy from me or maybe if you don't\nhave e-commerce, they order from me or"},"254":{"dur":1,"text":"they engage with me."},"256":{"dur":2,"text":"I think a transaction is someone\ngave you their email

before,"},"264":{"dur":3,"text":"besides just blasting a message out into\nthe world where you don't even know if"},"268":{"dur":2,"text":"they had the impression or not."},"270":{"dur":3,"text":"And we've started seeing a lot\nof very interesting pieces of"},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"data come together where\nyou start analyzing things."},"275":{"dur":3,"text":"So one of my favorite stories is I was in\nNew York doing an event for Google and"},"279":{"dur":3,"text":"they brought in their 300\nlargest education clients, so"},"282":{"dur":1,"text":"places like Columbia and Phoenix and"},"284":{"dur":4,"text":"all the other bigger educational\nfacilities that advertise with them."},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"And my buddy Avinash had done this test."},"290":{"dur":1,"text":"And, so what's the macro conversion?"},"292":{"dur":0,"text":"What's the e-commerce?"},"293":{"dur":2,"text":"What's the ordering on education sites?"},"295":{"dur":3,"text":"Someone registers, right, for\na course, or for a program."},"299":{"dur":3,"text":"And what he did is he realized,\nit's interesting, that if somebody"},"302":{"dur":4,"text":"comes onto the site, watches the video and\nthen signs up for the e-newsletter,"},"306":{"dur":5,"text":"there's like an 80% plus chance for\nthis site of getting the macro conversion."},"311":{"dur":3,"text":"But if you look to see where the spend\nwas happening, it was nowhere near there."},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"They weren't paying attention to\nthe video that they just posted once, and"},"317":{"dur":3,"text":"they really weren't doing all that\nmuch dynamic with the newsletter."},"321":{"dur":3,"text":"That's a fascinating thing that we look at\ntransactions typically as this big thing,"},"324":{"dur":1,"text":"that they finally buy from us."},"326":{"dur":2,"text":"When in reality,\nthe transactions are minor and small."},"328":{"dur":3,"text":"Now if you take these three little pigs\nand look at them you have one, the ability"},"332":{"dur":4,"text":"to create this sort of disruption if you\nwill, right, this ability to change."},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"That's actually an internal function."},"339":{"dur":1,"text":"Number two is to innovate."},"340":{"dur":2,"text":"The innovation part is what\nthe customer actually sees."},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"And number three, the transaction part,\nthat's actually what they do,"},"346":{"dur":1,"text":"they can do something now."},"347":{"dur":1,"text":"And it may seem simplistic to you, but"},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"it's actually pretty dramatic\nto think that as marketing and"},"352":{"dur":4,"text":"brand communication leaders, you can have\ninput into all these different components."},"357":{"dur":2,"text":"Whereas before,\nwe just put a message out there,"},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"hoped the sales people did their job, and\nthen hoped that somewhere down the line,"},"362":{"dur":1,"text":"we can validate why we\nspent all that money."},"364":{"dur":1,"text":"Now that is the true, real transformation."},"366":{"dur":1,"text":"That is the real disruption\nthat's happened."},"368":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think marketers and brand leaders\nhave really done a really poor job of"},"372":{"dur":3,"text":"embracing the whole spectrum\nof things that they can do."},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"But remember,\nwe're here to talk about this consumer."},"378":{"dur":3,"text":"So what happens is when I talk about those\nthree little pigs, people go, my God,"},"381":{"dur":1,"text":"how are we ever going to do this?"},"382":{"dur":1,"text":"This seems insurmountable."},"384":{"dur":3,"text":"And the truth is it's very,\nvery large and hard to do."},"387":{"dur":3,"text":"So what I try and tell people\nis it's actually little things."},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"If you look at it from\nthe perspective of the customer,"},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"it's actually these little nuanced\nthings that consumers have done that"},"396":{"dur":1,"text":"have changed the way\nwe interact with them."},"398":{"dur":3,"text":"Snapchat is the ability for you and\nI to agree that we're gonna connect."},"401":{"dur":1,"text":"And that if I send you an image or\na video,"},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"you're going to look at that video and\nonce you see it it disappears,"},"406":{"dur":3,"text":"unless you're the NSA, then we can talk\nabout that, probably another session."},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"Now we know Snapchat and a lot of you\nare raising your hands because of"},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"the growth in popularity\nthat it's been experiencing."},"415":{"dur":3,"text":"But I go back to when I first started\nhearing about Snapchat in 2012 to"},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"a moment in 2013 when this happened."},"421":{"dur":4,"text":"So this happens in 2013 and basically, I\ndon't know if you remember this moment in"},"425":{"dur":4,"text":"time, but when I heard this news, the left\nside of my body started going numb."},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"I had a sensation that I could smell and\ntaste burnt toast."},"432":{"dur":1,"text":"I was literally stroking out."},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"I couldn't believe this,\nbecause Snapchat was so new."},"437":{"dur":1,"text":"They had so few employees."},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"There really was no revenues."},"439":{"dur":3,"text":"There wasn't even video on Snapchat at\nthe time, and Facebook comes in and"},"443":{"dur":3,"text":"says I wanna buy you for $3 billion,\nand they go no, we're good."},"446":{"dur":5,"text":"Now how many of you have a 20, 25 year old\ndaughter or son and, or you are an uncle"},"452":{"dur":5,"text":"or

supper on\nFriday and my 25 year old son or"},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"daughter is there and\nI go, how does this work?"},"465":{"dur":3,"text":"Go in with your cute little start up\nSnapchat with your eight friends."},"468":{"dur":4,"text":"And they go Dad you're not going to\nbelieve this, Facebook came to acquire us."},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"You'd be like this is\nthe greatest day ever."},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"And then they're like, we said no."},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"And you're like, you said no?"},"480":{"dur":0,"text":"What was it?"},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"Was it not enough money?"},"483":{"dur":3,"text":"No no they offered us $3 billion."},"487":{"dur":4,"text":"Now again, I live in Canada, I'm pretty\nfamiliar with our laws down there."},"492":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm sure I'm somewhat familiar with the\nchild abuse laws up here in the US too,"},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"but we'd have some strops being\nthrown that night, right?"},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"We have to admit that this\nis a crazy thing, right?"},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"And so you see this and you think this\nis absurd that at any point in time any"},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"company like this would say\nno to that amount of money."},"507":{"dur":3,"text":"But if I were to also say to you, put on\nyour marketing, communications, brand, and"},"510":{"dur":0,"text":"technology brains."},"511":{"dur":3,"text":"And tell me,\nwho are the real winners online right now?"},"514":{"dur":4,"text":"Who are the winners who are really doing\nthings with content in a dynamic way?"},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"In a very sort of forward thinking way?"},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"And I would say the brands that\nare really nailing this have"},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"three things going when it comes\nto the content side of things."},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"One is it is purely image based."},"528":{"dur":3,"text":"And when I say an image, it could be\na photo, it could be a video right?"},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"Two is we know it's what I\nwould call mobile first."},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"What does mobile first mean?"},"535":{"dur":3,"text":"Mobile first just means that the\nexperience on your mobile device is better"},"539":{"dur":1,"text":"than it is on your desktop or PC."},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"And so if you look at the things\nthat are sort of booming around us,"},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"Snapchat would be one,\nInstagram could be another."},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"Tinder, from what I'm told,\nwould be another."},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm married, my wife,\nshe doesn't let me date."},"551":{"dur":0,"text":"She's funny like that."},"552":{"dur":3,"text":"But we know that this is what works,\nright, so it's mobile first,"},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"when the mobile experience is\nbetter than the web experience."},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"And then the third part is, it's social."},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"And when I say social,\nit's easy to go well viral, viral."},"563":{"dur":1,"text":"That's a great effect."},"565":{"dur":4,"text":"Social is just whatever thing's being\ncreated, I create in a way where the hooks"},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"are built in that I can share it and\ntalk about it in the easiest way possible."},"572":{"dur":0,"text":"So when you agree with that,"},"573":{"dur":3,"text":"that that sort of seems to be the best\nthing brands can do right now."},"577":{"dur":1,"text":"And so\nif you think about that as a construct and"},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"you go back to when they said actually no."},"581":{"dur":0,"text":"Here's what happened."},"582":{"dur":1,"text":"And here's sort of\na screenshot of the world."},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"This is November 2013 photo-sharing sites."},"586":{"dur":3,"text":"So see here that Facebook actually\nowned 43% of this market."},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"Instagram owns 7%."},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"Flickr, what happened\nto poor little Flickr?"},"593":{"dur":0,"text":"Remember Flickr?"},"594":{"dur":1,"text":">> [LAUGH]\n>> 1%."},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"People used to comment to me,\nI've got a great idea for photos."},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was like, are you crazy,\nFlickr dominates!"},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's like two minutes later,\nit's like what happened to Flickr?"},"602":{"dur":4,"text":"And then if you'll see here,\n49% is actually Snapchat."},"607":{"dur":1,"text":"Isn't that amazing?"},"608":{"dur":3,"text":"So we're sitting here and doing this\nuncomfortable laugh that Facebook and"},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"Snapchat couldn't get a deal done for\n$3 billion."},"614":{"dur":3,"text":"And the truth is that Facebook knew for\na paltry $3 billion, and"},"617":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't joke when say that, for them they\nhave a massive war chest, this wouldn't be"},"621":{"dur":5,"text":"that massive an investment,\nthey could have 100% dominated the exact"},"626":{"dur":4,"text":"space that we all agree is where the\nwinners are today, three plus years later."},"630":{"dur":3,"text":"And what is amazing about this is that\nif you fast forward to last week,"},"634":{"dur":0,"text":"this is what's happening."},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"Snapchat introduces videos."},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"Facebook have introduced videos."},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"Facebook is doing about 8 billion\nvideos views every single day."},"641":{"dur":3,"text":"Snapchat, as of last week has 8\nbillion views every single day."},"645":{"dur":3,"text":"They've literally matched them, imagine\nhad they actually done the acquisition,"},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"close to 20 billion videos\nviews a day just by Facebook."},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"Now suddenly, they're in the crosshairs\nof brands like YouTube and Google and"},"656":{"dur":0,"text":"things like that."},"657":{"dur":3,"text":"And so before you ask yourself,\nwell did Snapchat make a mistake or"},"660":{"dur":1,"text":"are they the future of digital?"},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"I want to circle back to say we\nhave the three little pigs and"},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"these nuanced little changes\nthat your customers are making."},"667":{"dur":3,"text":"Cuz if you think about it,\nSnapchat introduced something very,"},"671":{"dur":3,"text":"very dynamic and new that most people\ndon't even talk about in this,"},"674":{"dur":4,"text":"in all of their crazy growth and\nthe excitement that we all have about it."},"678":{"dur":0,"text":"So back in 2012,"},"679":{"dur":4,"text":"Snapchat comes out and I look at it and\nI'm like, this is really weird."},"683":{"dur":3,"text":"I send a picture to you,\nyou look at it and it disappears."},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"What's the point?"},"688":{"dur":3,"text":"But what I realize is that Snapchat had\ndone in a very small and nuanced way,"},"692":{"dur":3,"text":"they had introduced a new way in\nwhich people communicate online."},"695":{"dur":3,"text":"They introduce something I called back\nin 2012 the impermanent Internet."},"699":{"dur":1,"text":"Now what does that mean?"},"701":{"dur":3,"text":"It means that suddenly Snapchat becomes\nvery replicative of the conversations"},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"we have in our day to day lives."},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"I was watching all of you here and\nout there."},"708":{"dur":3,"text":"Some of you were taking selfies and\nposting to Twitter, fantastic."},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"But the vast majority of\nthe conversations that we've had and"},"713":{"dur":4,"text":"interactions we have aren't recorded and\nthen uploaded onto the Internet."},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"And Snapchat just sort of introduces sort\nof a seemless habit that people have to"},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"naturally communicate with each other\nwithout having the archive of it."},"724":{"dur":0,"text":"Now why is this unique?"},"725":{"dur":3,"text":"Well in this room, we are the ones who\nare going to brands every single day and"},"728":{"dur":5,"text":"saying get online, get a website, get on\nsocial media, do all this stuff, why?"},"733":{"dur":3,"text":"Because the Internet and\nGoogle is like an elephant."},"737":{"dur":1,"text":"It never forgets."},"739":{"dur":3,"text":"And if you as a brand are not online,\nwhatever someone searched for,"},"742":{"dur":3,"text":"whether it's in a generic search like on\nGoogle or on a social space like Twitter,"},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"when you ask someone,\nhey is this brand any good?"},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"Whatever comes back is the first\nbrand impression, right?"},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"It's positive, negative, or\nneutral that's the brand impression."},"755":{"dur":1,"text":"That is what it is."},"756":{"dur":4,"text":"And yet, in a small nuanced way Snapchat\nintroduced an entirely normal way that we"},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"communicate into the digital\nconstruct of it."},"763":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's changed the consumers in a very,\nvery powerful way."},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, if you sort of start\nthinking about things,"},"769":{"dur":3,"text":"like what's another thing that happened\nin a small nuanced way from consumers?"},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"Ownership became a very big thing\nin this past short little while."},"776":{"dur":2,"text":"It was not that long ago that\nBlu-ray came out and you were like,"},"779":{"dur":3,"text":"I just bought the entire\nStar Wars trilogy on DVD,"},"782":{"dur":3,"text":"now I have to buy it all on Blu-ray,\nthanks, right?"},"786":{"dur":3,"text":"And then it switches in a very, very\nquick way and suddenly we have streaming."},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"And streaming comes in and\nwe go sure Netflix, no problem."},"792":{"dur":3,"text":"7, 8 bucks 9 bucks a month and\nwe suddenly streaming and we all go great!"},"796":{"dur":3,"text":"But there are subtleties underneath it\nthat I don't think we understand that have"},"800":{"dur":2,"text":"dramatically changed the way\nconsumers interact with brand and"},"803":{"dur":2,"text":"actually how they interact\nwith buying things in general."},"806":{"dur":1,"text":"So if you look at Netflix,\nhere's what we know, right,"},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"Netflix has 75 plus million subscribers."},"810":{"dur":2,"text":"We know that 10 billion hours\nare being streamed by it every month."},"813":{"dur":3,"text":"But here's the big thing about Netflix,\nno more hard drives."},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"You used to download movies legally or\notherwise, and"},"819":{"dur":3,"text":"it would fill up your hard drive, and\nthen you would take the jump drive and"},"822":{"dur":1,"text":"put it on that and have them there."},"823":{"dur":4,"text":"And then you bought like bigger portable\nhard drives and you put them there."},"827":{"dur":1,"text":"And then you're like,\nthis is too stressful."},"829":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll take an old computer and\nI'll leave it in my home and"},"831":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll make it like in the media center."},"832":{"dur":1,"text":"We use WiFi to connect it right?"},"834":{"dur":0,"text":"It's crazy."},"835":{"dur":5,"text":"And then, suddenly, this thing comes along\nand poof, no more hard drives, right?"},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, one more thing happens\nthat's very, very dramatic."},"843":{"dur":2,"text":"How many of you remember this,\non a Friday night, you would go home."},"846":{"dur":2,"text":"You would have dinner with your family,\nand then in the middle of winter,"},"848":{"dur":2,"text":"you would get in your car, and\nyou would drive to the video store, and"},"851":{"dur":2,"text":"you'd go up and down the aisles of the\nvideo store, and there were no

on,"},"860":{"dur":2,"text":"looking at the selection and going, I\ndon't even know what to choose there's so"},"862":{"dur":1,"text":"much good stuff to watch here."},"864":{"dur":2,"text":"You have analysis paralysis."},"866":{"dur":4,"text":"But what's happened from a small consumer\nway is that suddenly, as a consumer,"},"870":{"dur":3,"text":"you're recognizing the amazing power\nthat you have when you're paying for"},"873":{"dur":2,"text":"access over ownership."},"876":{"dur":3,"text":"And you're seeing this in music streaming\nservices and beyond and
