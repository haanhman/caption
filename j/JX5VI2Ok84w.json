they hear."},"709":{"dur":9,"text":"Now, in fact there's even, to me, amazing\nresearch that suggests that babies are learning"},"719":{"dur":3,"text":"the accent of their native language while\nthey are still in the womb."},"722":{"dur":6,"text":"You can see how all this is setting things\nup so the baby is ready to learn language"},"729":{"dur":6,"text":"as soon as they come out of the womb

this baby will eventually speak."},"747":{"dur":7,"text":"And so, from the moment of birth scientists\nhave discovered babies cry in the accent of"},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"their mother's native

this really amazing way."},"784":{"dur":5,"text":"Now if you think about this, this is very\nadaptive, this is very--this is a really great"},"789":{"dur":6,"text":"idea for babies to already be getting a head\nstart on language before they're born and"},"795":{"dur":7,"text":"even making sounds that are recognizably familiar\nto the mother."},"803":{"dur":5,"text":"This might have kind of

birth."},"816":{"dur":5,"text":"The baby makes sounds that sound like a familiar\nsound as soon as they're born."},"821":{"dur":7,"text":"This is a way that babies are already becoming\na part of their community."},"828":{"dur":8,"text":"You know, we often think when a baby's born\nthat they're somehow brand-new to the world."},"836":{"dur":5,"text":"But in fact the world, the specific

fetus is not only being shaped by those\ninfluences but is also actively responding"},"854":{"dur":7,"text":"to and learning from and remembering those\ninfluences, and as we've seen, this gives"},"861":{"dur":6,"text":"babies a head start on all the things they're\ngoing to have to learn as infants and as children."},"868":{"dur":5,"text":"So, the baby emerges already familiar with\nthe diet of its culture."},"874":{"dur":5,"text":"The baby emerges already knowing and responding\nto its mother's voice."},"879":{"dur":5,"text":"The baby emerges knowing the rhythm and the\ncadence of its mother's language, and recognizing"},"885":{"dur":6,"text":"certain words and rhymes and songs, and the\nbaby emerges even sounding already a bit like"},"891":{"dur":2,"text":"a member of that community."},"894":{"dur":4,"text":"So I'll close with one more really interesting\nstudy that has implications for how we might"},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"treat premature

preemie\u2019s brain development because"},"944":{"dur":5,"text":"that fetal learning that goes on at the end\nof pregnancy is so crucial."},"949":{"dur":6,"text":"So scientists at Harvard Medical School recently\nstarted exploring these issues--this is really"},"955":{"dur":3,"text":"cutting-edge stuff--by running this experiment."},"958":{"dur":6,"text":"They took a group of premature babies who\nwere born at twenty-five to thirty-two weeks."},"965":{"dur":5,"text":"Now think about that: if they were full-term\nbabies they would still have had another eight"},"970":{"dur":2,"text":"to fifteen weeks in the womb."},"973":{"dur":1,"text":"That's a long time."},"974":{"dur":6,"text":"Half of these babies in the experiment heard\njust the usual noises of the NICU, of the"},"981":{"dur":1,"text":"hospital."},"982":{"dur":4,"text":"You know, the beeps and the nurses moving\naround and--but nothing like they would have"},"986":{"dur":1,"text":"heard in the womb."},"987":{"dur":7,"text":"The other half of this group of premature\nbabies heard recordings that their mothers"},"994":{"dur":5,"text":"made of their voices and of their heartbeats."},"999":{"dur":8,"text":"A few months later, the brains of all the\nbabies were scanned using ultrasound, and"},"1008":{"dur":5,"text":"the brains of the babies that heard their\nmother's voices through this recording that"},"1014":{"dur":6,"text":"was kind of piped in to their incubator, the\npart of the brain that is associated with"},"1020":{"dur":6,"text":"hearing and interpreting sounds--the auditory\ncortex--was bigger in those premature babies"},"1027":{"dur":3,"text":"who'd heard recordings of their mother's voices."},"1031":{"dur":7,"text":"So, just by talking, just by carrying out\nher daily life, the pregnant woman is helping"},"1039":{"dur":8,"text":"her baby's brain to grow, which I think is\nan amazing and a much more hopeful message"},"1047":{"dur":5,"text":"than the ones that pregnant women often get,\nwhich is, you know, \"Be careful."},"1053":{"dur":2,"text":"Don't do the wrong thing, you'll hurt your\nbaby,\" you

infant."},"1065":{"dur":8,"text":"So, this I think pretty ingenious experiment\nby these Harvard Medical School professors"},"1074":{"dur":5,"text":"suggests that premature babies should be allowed\nto visit with their parents as much as possible"},"1079":{"dur":5,"text":"and maybe also that they should also be hearing\nrecordings of their mother's voice and
