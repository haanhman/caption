it again today."},"294":{"dur":1,"text":"That worship is a response."},"295":{"dur":6,"text":"It's our response to God's mercy, it's our\nresponse to life's struggles, it's also

pattern of rebellion against God, a pattern\nof self-worship, and even in the Roman context,"},"383":{"dur":3,"text":"there was a pattern of the worship of Caesar."},"387":{"dur":5,"text":"And so what Paul is saying is \"if you present\nyour body to God as a living sacrifice, then"},"392":{"dur":4,"text":"you will be doing an act of worship that has\nnothing to do with songs, nothing to do with"},"397":{"dur":3,"text":"words, nothing to do with singing, nothing\nto do with a Sunday morning worship service,"},"400":{"dur":1,"text":"or a Friday morning

what"},"436":{"dur":4,"text":"God has done, we are defying the system of\nthe world."},"440":{"dur":3,"text":"So I want to give you a couple of ideas that\nwill help you as you think about worship in"},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"this context, of being an act of rebellion."},"447":{"dur":4,"text":"You know, I never do Convo unless I talk about\nmy kids and so I don't want to break
