courage."},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"There are mini victories, they move you\nonto the next small step,"},"784":{"dur":1,"text":"that's not quite so small,"},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"and so you can use those as a way\nto encourage yourself."},"787":{"dur":1,"text":"So you've got your mission,"},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"you've got the need\nto find small steps,"},"791":{"dur":1,"text":"but if you really want\nto pin down the small steps,"},"792":{"dur":1,"text":"ask yourself this question:"},"794":{"dur":3,"text":"What can you do\nin the next 24 hours?"},"797":{"dur":1,"text":"Because if you can't do\nanything in the next 24 hours,"},"799":{"dur":3,"text":"what makes you think\nyou will ever start?"},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"Ok, so you've got the mission,\nyou've got the small steps,"},"805":{"dur":2,"text":"and now you're going\nto need to find some allies."},"807":{"dur":1,"text":"You're not going to do\nmuch all on your own."},"809":{"dur":1,"text":"So one way you can do that,"},"810":{"dur":1,"text":"is to try and draw a map\nof your support network,"},"812":{"dur":1,"text":"the people you already know."},"813":{"dur":1,"text":"Do it like this,\nput yourself in the middle,"},"814":{"dur":1,"text":"put the names of people\naround the edge"},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"who give you support\nand to whom you give support."},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"So on this one you can see\nI'm giving a lot of support to William."},"820":{"dur":1,"text":"He is giving me nothing back."},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"What do I do about that?\nI'll have to work it out."},"824":{"dur":3,"text":"But the relationships\nthat are most useful,"},"828":{"dur":2,"text":"and psychologists use this\nwith addicts and alcoholics,"},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"are the ones that are reciprocal."},"831":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can see Sonya and Ben,\nboth are reciprocal relationships."},"834":{"dur":1,"text":"So you might want to draw this map,\nit is quite interesting."},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"And then go and ask\nthose people for help."},"838":{"dur":2,"text":"You must actually ask them to help you."},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"You might think, \"I can't ask,\nthat's awful, a real imposition.\""},"843":{"dur":1,"text":"But people like to be asked,\nbecause it means"},"844":{"dur":2,"text":"that they are wise and kind\nand generous and sensitive."},"846":{"dur":2,"text":"But the only reason people\ndon't like to be asked,"},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"is when they can't see\na way to say no."},"851":{"dur":1,"text":"So you say to them,\n\"Would you help?"},"852":{"dur":1,"text":"And by the way if you can't,"},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"either now or at any time\nin the future, I really don't mind.\""},"856":{"dur":1,"text":"And you have to mean it."},"857":{"dur":0,"text":"And once you've asked them\nin that way,"},"858":{"dur":1,"text":"why would they say no?"},"859":{"dur":1,"text":"And what you have done\nthen is liberate them"},"860":{"dur":1,"text":"to be an active part of your mission."},"862":{"dur":2,"text":"They will want to do things,\nto really be part of it."},"865":{"dur":1,"text":"And they'll phone you and say,"},"866":{"dur":1,"text":"they've seen something\nin the newspapers."},"867":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's great."},"868":{"dur":1,"text":"You may also find that\nthere are other people,"},"870":{"dur":1,"text":"sort of activists all over the country."},"871":{"dur":1,"text":"This is my country, the U.K."},"872":{"dur":2,"text":"You may find people spread\nall over the place,"},"874":{"dur":1,"text":"and you can go and find some of those."},"876":{"dur":3,"text":"And I want to end, by giving you\nsome account of my own experience."},"880":{"dur":1,"text":"Because I feel a bit dishonored,"},"881":{"dur":2,"text":"standing in front of you and say\nanyone could change the world,"},"884":{"dur":3,"text":"if I didn't try to say something\nhow I've tried to do."},"888":{"dur":1,"text":"So some years ago,"},"889":{"dur":1,"text":"I got very seriously freaked out,"},"890":{"dur":1,"text":"very depressed about climate change,"},"892":{"dur":4,"text":"and peak oil, result shortages,\nthat are coming."},"896":{"dur":1,"text":"And I didn't know what to do,"},"897":{"dur":1,"text":"I thought we had to change\nthe whole way that everyone lives,"},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"we had to get much more\nself-sufficient, more resourceful,"},"901":{"dur":1,"text":"stop flying things around the world."},"902":{"dur":2,"text":"Everyone has got to start growing food."},"905":{"dur":1,"text":"They've got to start making\ntheir own clothes,"},"906":{"dur":1,"text":"doing all sorts of things like that."},"907":{"dur":1,"text":"So I joined all the campaign\ngroups you can imagine"},"909":{"dur":1,"text":"and there were wonderful"},"911":{"dur":3,"text":"and we did some great stuff\njoining these networks nationwide."},"914":{"dur":1,"text":"After about a year,"},"916":{"dur":1,"text":"I realized we were doing\nsome amazing stuff"},"917":{"dur":1,"text":"but I was seeing all the same faces."},"918":{"dur":1,"text":"Lovely faces, but all the same faces."},"920":{"dur":1,"text":"And I wanted everybody to change,"},"921":{"dur":2,"text":"not just the seasoned campaigners."},"924":{"dur":2,"text":"And I happen around then to read\na book by Alistair Mackintosh"},"926":{"dur":3,"text":"which talks about how it's\nno good being a campaigner,"},"929":{"dur":1,"text":"if you're not a good neighbor."},"931":{"dur":1,"text":"And it kind of hit me\nin the head right there,"},"932":{"dur":1,"text":"so you know why I've now asked you"},"934":{"dur":1,"text":"to think of each other as neighbors."},"935":{"dur":1,"text":"I felt like, what can I do with it,"},"936":{"dur":1,"text":"so I can resign from\nthese campaigners,"},"938":{"dur":1,"text":"and I went to work on my street,"},"940":{"dur":3,"text":"and I had an allotment where\nI was growing my own food."},"943":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I went to the allotment,\nfilled a sack full of apples"},"946":{"dur":1,"text":"and I went home."},"947":{"dur":2,"text":"And I have a wonderful beautiful wife\nand daughter,"},"949":{"dur":3,"text":"little daughter at the time, Nancy,\nand so I grabbed Nancy's hand,"},"953":{"dur":3,"text":"I didn't need to take Nancy,\nbut she gave me courage basically."},"956":{"dur":1,"text":"And so I took the sack and the apples,"},"957":{"dur":1,"text":"and I carried Nancy along with me."},"959":{"dur":2,"text":"We knocked on every door,\nand people opened the door"},"961":{"dur":2,"text":"and I said I'm taking the risk."},"963":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah, a man with apples and\na lovely daughter isn't a big threat."},"966":{"dur":1,"text":"And they opened the door\nand I took the apples,"},"967":{"dur":1,"text":"and so that was nice\nto get to know people a bit better."},"969":{"dur":3,"text":"Then, the sneaky bit\nwas six months later"},"973":{"dur":2,"text":"but forgive me, because\nit came from the right place."},"975":{"dur":2,"text":"I deliberately grew\ntoo many tomato seedlings,"},"978":{"dur":1,"text":"and I put them all in a box,"},"979":{"dur":1,"text":"and I grabbed Nancy's\nlovely hand again,"},"981":{"dur":2,"text":"and we walked on the street,\nand knocked on the doors."},"983":{"dur":2,"text":"We'd said, \"Hello\", then\nNancy again said, \"Hello\""},"986":{"dur":2,"text":"and I said \"Oh dear, I've got\ntoo many tomato seedlings\""},"989":{"dur":1,"text":"and I gave it to them,\nand they took them."},"991":{"dur":2,"text":"And I know for a fact that\nmany people in my street"},"993":{"dur":1,"text":"that year for the first time\nstarted growing food."},"995":{"dur":3,"text":"So I hadn't had to freak them out about\nclimate change or resort shortages."},"999":{"dur":1,"text":"I just got them growing a plant,"},"1000":{"dur":1,"text":"that was kind of the solution."},"1001":{"dur":1,"text":"So I was very lucky,\nit was possible in that way,"},"1003":{"dur":2,"text":"to find the happy solution that way."},"1005":{"dur":3,"text":"Nancy drew a picture, this is\na reenactment for you."},"1009":{"dur":2,"text":"So I had been lucky"},"1011":{"dur":2,"text":"and by chance I discovered\nsomething that's really important"},"1014":{"dur":2,"text":"which is: Try to emphasize the positive."},"1016":{"dur":2,"text":"Because as the late philosopher\nReynold Williams once said,"},"1019":{"dur":3,"text":"\"The key is not to make\ndespair convincing,"},"1022":{"dur":2,"text":"but to make hope possible.\""},"1025":{"dur":2,"text":"You are on a journey,\nit starts now."},"1028":{"dur":1,"text":"You might as well make it fun."},"1029":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you."},"1031":{"dur":2,"text":"(Applause)"}}
