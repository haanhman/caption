{"1":{"dur":4,"text":"Today I'm going to show you how to make this really cool milk bottle"},"6":{"dur":1,"text":"out of chocolate."},"7":{"dur":2,"text":"You can fill it with sweets and candy."},"12":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you like, you can break it open."},"19":{"dur":3,"text":"It's the same idea as the chocolate coke bottle i made recently,"},"26":{"dur":3,"text":"and to make it we're going to need an ordinary milk bottle."},"32":{"dur":1,"text":"Once you've emptied it,"},"35":{"dur":3,"text":"give the bottle a good wash out with some fresh clean water,"},"42":{"dur":1,"text":"and leave it to dry."},"46":{"dur":4,"text":"If you like you can use some kitchen paper to help absorb any moisture."},"58":{"dur":2,"text":"Then carefully remove the label,"},"62":{"dur":2,"text":"and keep it to one side because we'll be using this later."},"66":{"dur":6,"text":"Next we need to put a bowl in to a pan of hot water to make a bain-marie ready to melt some chocolate."},"73":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm using white cooking chocolate."},"75":{"dur":0,"text":"Open it up,"},"79":{"dur":1,"text":"and break it into pieces."},"86":{"dur":1,"text":"Place it into the bowl,"},"90":{"dur":2,"text":"and you should find it slowly starts to melt."},"96":{"dur":6,"text":"Because of the size of the milk bottle, we're going to need a lot of chocolate so I'm adding a few more slabs."},"116":{"dur":3,"text":"When it's all melted remove the bowl from the pan,"},"120":{"dur":2,"text":"and sit it on the side for a minute,"},"123":{"dur":5,"text":"then place a funnel in the top of your milk bottle and carefully pour in the melted chocolate."},"133":{"dur":5,"text":"We want the bottle to be nice and strong so we're going to need quite a lot of chocolate to make a nice thick layer."},"146":{"dur":5,"text":"Next we need to carefully tilt and rotate the bottle to completely coat the inside."},"154":{"dur":1,"text":"Make sure the handle is full,"},"157":{"dur":3,"text":"and slowly work your way to the top of the bottle."},"166":{"dur":1,"text":"When it's all been covered,"},"170":{"dur":2,"text":"sit the bottle down and leave it to dry."},"173":{"dur":6,"text":"As it's setting we need to regularly spin the bottle to continue building up a nice thick layer inside."},"181":{"dur":4,"text":"We want the chocolate to be nice and thick to make the bottle nice and strong."},"188":{"dur":3,"text":"If you need to, you can pour in more melted chocolate."},"194":{"dur":3,"text":"Once it's completely set, it'll look like this."},"199":{"dur":2,"text":"And now we need to remove the plastic bottle,"},"203":{"dur":3,"text":"so take a sharp knife and carefully cut off the plastic."},"210":{"dur":7,"text":"Try not to damage the chocolate with your knife, and if you start down at the bottom the label will cover up any mess."},"219":{"dur":5,"text":"It is a little tricky but if you go nice and slowly you should find it comes off okay."},"226":{"dur":2,"text":"I removed the bottom section first,"},"230":{"dur":1,"text":"and the started on then top."},"235":{"dur":4,"text":"You need to be especially careful around the handle to make sure it doesn't snap."},"241":{"dur":1,"text":"Clear up any mess."},"245":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's our finished chocolate milk bottle."},"250":{"dur":1,"text":"Slide the label back over,"},"254":{"dur":1,"text":"and screw on the lid."},"258":{"dur":4,"text":"It looks great and most people would think it's just and ordinary bottle of milk."},"265":{"dur":1,"text":"If you like you can open it up,"},"267":{"dur":2,"text":"and pour in some sweets or candy."},"272":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm adding a selection of different things so it's a nice surprise."},"280":{"dur":1,"text":"You can fill it up as far as you like,"},"284":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'm filling mine right to the top."},"288":{"dur":1,"text":"Screw the lid back on,"},"291":{"dur":4,"text":"and there's our finished chocolate milk bottle surprise, Pretty cool, huh?"},"297":{"dur":4,"text":"If you like you can open up the lid, and pour out the contents."},"303":{"dur":7,"text":"Or whats really cool is to lie it down on it's side and break it open to spill out the sweets, I'm gonna use a hammer."},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"It's really thick so it takes a few hits."},"319":{"dur":3,"text":"Tidy it up a bit, remove some of the crumbled chocolate,"},"324":{"dur":1,"text":"and it looks like this."},"327":{"dur":1,"text":"Pretty cool, Huh?"},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"It looks amazing and is great fun to make."},"335":{"dur":3,"text":"It's perfect for parties and you can fill it with whatever you like."},"340":{"dur":2,"text":"You
