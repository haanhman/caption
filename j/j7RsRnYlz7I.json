seas,"},"244":{"dur":2,"text":"two oceans, nine ports,"},"247":{"dur":2,"text":"and I learned a lot about shipping."},"250":{"dur":1,"text":"And one of the first things that surprised me"},"252":{"dur":2,"text":"when I got on board Kendal"},"254":{"dur":2,"text":"was, where are all the people?"},"257":{"dur":1,"text":"I have friends in the Navy who tell me"},"258":{"dur":3,"text":"they sail with 1,000 sailors at a time,"},"261":{"dur":3,"text":"but on Kendal there were only 21 crew."},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"Now that's because shipping is very

find"},"282":{"dur":4,"text":"on a container ship is either tired or exhausted,"},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"because the pace of modern shipping"},"289":{"dur":2,"text":"is quite punishing for what the shipping calls"},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"its human element,"},"293":{"dur":2,"text":"a strange phrase which they don't seem to realize"},"296":{"dur":2,"text":"sounds a little bit inhuman."},"298":{"dur":2,"text":"So most seafarers now working on container ships"},"301":{"dur":4,"text":"often have less than two hours in port at a time."},"305":{"dur":1,"text":"They don't have time to relax."},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"They're at sea for months at a time,"},"309":{"dur":1,"text":"and even when they're on board,"},"310":{"dur":1,"text":"they don't have access to what"},"312":{"dur":4,"text":"a five-year-old would take for granted, the Internet."},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"And another thing that surprised me\nwhen I got on board Kendal"},"319":{"dur":2,"text":"was who I was sitting next to --"},"322":{"dur":5,"text":"Not the queen; I can't imagine why\nthey put me underneath her portrait --"},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"But around that dining table in the officer's saloon,"},"330":{"dur":1,"text":"I was sitting next to a Burmese guy,"},"332":{"dur":3,"text":"I was opposite a Romanian, a Moldavian, an Indian."},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"On the next table was a Chinese guy,"},"337":{"dur":3,"text":"and in the crew room, it was entirely Filipinos."},"340":{"dur":2,"text":"So that was a normal working ship."},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"Now how is that possible?"},"345":{"dur":1,"text":"Because the biggest dramatic change"},"347":{"dur":1,"text":"in shipping over the last 60 years,"},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"when most of the general public stopped noticing it,"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"was something called an open registry,"},"354":{"dur":2,"text":"or a flag of convenience."},"357":{"dur":2,"text":"Ships can now fly the flag of any nation"},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"that provides a flag registry."},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"You can get a flag from the landlocked nation"},"365":{"dur":2,"text":"of Bolivia, or Mongolia,"},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"or North Korea, though that's not very popular."},"370":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"So we have these very multinational,"},"373":{"dur":4,"text":"global, mobile crews on ships."},"378":{"dur":2,"text":"And that was a surprise to me."},"381":{"dur":3,"text":"And when we got to pirate waters,"},"384":{"dur":3,"text":"down the Bab-el-Mandeb strait\nand into the Indian Ocean,"},"387":{"dur":1,"text":"the ship changed."},"389":{"dur":3,"text":"And that was also shocking, because suddenly,"},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"I realized, as the captain said to me,"},"394":{"dur":2,"text":"that I had been crazy to choose to go"},"396":{"dur":3,"text":"through pirate waters on a container ship."},"399":{"dur":1,"text":"We were no longer allowed on deck."},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"There were double pirate watches."},"404":{"dur":4,"text":"And at that time, there were those \n544 seafarers being held hostage,"},"408":{"dur":1,"text":"and some of them were held hostage for years"},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"because of the nature of shipping\nand the flag of convenience."},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"Not all of them, but some of them were,"},"415":{"dur":4,"text":"because for the minority\nof unscrupulous ship owners,"},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"it can be easy to hide behind"},"422":{"dur":4,"text":"the anonymity offered by some flags of convenience."},"427":{"dur":3,"text":"What else does our sea blindness mask?"},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, if you go out to sea on a ship"},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"or on a cruise ship, and look up to the funnel,"},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"you'll see very black smoke."},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's because shipping"},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"has very tight margins,\nand they want cheap fuel,"},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"so they use something called bunker fuel,"},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"which was described to me\nby someone in the tanker industry"},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"as the dregs of the refinery,"},"450":{"dur":3,"text":"or just one step up from asphalt."},"454":{"dur":3,"text":"And shipping is the greenest method of transport."},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"In terms of carbon emissions per ton per mile,"},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"it emits about a thousandth of aviation"},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"and about a tenth of trucking."},"464":{"dur":3,"text":"But it's not benign, because there's so much of it."},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"So shipping emissions are\nabout three to four percent,"},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"almost the same as aviation's."},"472":{"dur":1,"text":"And if you put shipping emissions"},"474":{"dur":3,"text":"on a list of the countries' carbon emissions,"},"477":{"dur":1,"text":"it would come in about sixth,"},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"somewhere near Germany."},"481":{"dur":4,"text":"It was calculated in 2009 that the 15 largest ships"},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"pollute in terms of particles and soot"},"487":{"dur":1,"text":"and noxious gases"},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"as much as all the cars in the

on."},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"But why has it taken so long?"},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"When are we going to start talking and thinking"},"502":{"dur":4,"text":"about shipping miles as well as air miles?"},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"I also traveled to Cape Cod to look"},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"at the plight of the North Atlantic right whale,"},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"because this to me was one\nof the most surprising things"},"515":{"dur":1,"text":"about my time at sea,"},"517":{"dur":1,"text":"and what it made me think about."},"519":{"dur":3,"text":"We know about man's impact on the ocean"},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"in terms of fishing and overfishing,"},"524":{"dur":1,"text":"but we don't really know much about"},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"what's happening underneath the water."},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"And in fact, shipping has a role to play here,"},"531":{"dur":3,"text":"because shipping noise has contributed"},"535":{"dur":3,"text":"to damaging the acoustic\nhabitats of ocean creatures."},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"Light doesn't penetrate beneath\nthe surface of the water,"},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"so ocean creatures like whales and dolphins"},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"and even 800 species of fish"},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"communicate by sound."},"549":{"dur":1,"text":"And a North Atlantic right whale"},"550":{"dur":3,"text":"can transmit across hundreds of miles."},"553":{"dur":1,"text":"A humpback can transmit a sound"},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"across a whole ocean."},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"But a supertanker can also be heard"},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"coming across a whole ocean,"},"561":{"dur":2,"text":"and because the noise that\npropellers make underwater"},"564":{"dur":3,"text":"is sometimes at the same frequency that whales use,"},"567":{"dur":3,"text":"then it can damage their acoustic habitat,"},"570":{"dur":1,"text":"and they need this for breeding,"},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"for finding feeding grounds,"},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"for finding mates."},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"And the acoustic habitat of the\nNorth Atlantic right whale"},"579":{"dur":3,"text":"has been reduced by up to 90 percent."},"582":{"dur":4,"text":"But there are no laws governing \nacoustic pollution yet."},"587":{"dur":3,"text":"And when I arrived in Singapore,"},"590":{"dur":4,"text":"and I apologize for this,

garrulous and entertaining captain,"},"604":{"dur":4,"text":"and I would happily have signed up\nfor another five weeks,"},"608":{"dur":1,"text":"something that the captain also said"},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"I was crazy to think about."},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"But I wasn't there for nine months at a time"},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"like the Filipino
