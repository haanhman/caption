probabilities,"},"281":{"dur":3,"text":"and produces another superposition as its output."},"284":{"dur":6,"text":"So a quantum computer sets up some qubits, applies quantum gates to entangle them and manipulate probabilities,"},"291":{"dur":6,"text":"then finally measures the outcome, collapsing superpositions to an actual sequence of 0s and 1s."},"297":{"dur":6,"text":"What this means is that you
