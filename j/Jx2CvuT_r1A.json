there."},"506":{"dur":7,"text":"And maybe we can have a little more courage\nto put a little bit more separation here--just"},"514":{"dur":1,"text":"a little bit."},"515":{"dur":7,"text":"A little deeper recess here so that Mom has\nmore of a socket and a bridge to her nose."},"523":{"dur":4,"text":"And then we move down and we see opportunities\nhere."},"527":{"dur":5,"text":"Because that is dark enough now, now I see\nthat I can go ahead and show the corners of"},"532":{"dur":3,"text":"the mouth recessing into the face--into the\nmouth."},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"And it helps me see this."},"539":{"dur":12,"text":"Because it looks like Mom's mouth actually\nhas a little more to the smile than that."},"551":{"dur":8,"text":"It's not really an edge to the lip as much\nas it is just showing a deeper place where"},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"there's less light."},"562":{"dur":10,"text":"But it forms that wonderful smile that she\nhas--that wonderful, warm smile."},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"And sometimes that's just what makes the difference."},"575":{"dur":7,"text":"Sometimes it can be something that makes it\nsomething other than just something

everything."},"592":{"dur":4,"text":"If I have an opportunity to go past teeth,\nI don't want this to be the gums going all"},"597":{"dur":4,"text":"the way up to teeth and the teeth are setting\ndown here on the lip."},"601":{"dur":6,"text":"I can solve that really quick by showing that\nin a few places, I can see space that goes"},"608":{"dur":3,"text":"into the dark recesses of the mouth."},"611":{"dur":3,"text":"And that helps me understand that there's\na little separation."},"615":{"dur":9,"text":"Maybe the top teeth are separated now from\nthe bottom teeth.And then beyond that, now"},"624":{"dur":5,"text":"we have a clean edge here because we want\nto show that those teeth are being shaded"},"629":{"dur":1,"text":"by the upper ones."},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"And they go past the lip here."},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"So I want a clean edge."},"635":{"dur":7,"text":"Don't want to have it a line if I can at all\nhelp it."},"643":{"dur":8,"text":"But showing a couple--just a few little things\nwill help us to justify what's going on here."},"651":{"dur":5,"text":"Our brains just need a little bit of a hint\nand they just--it just interprets everything"},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"just wonderfully after that."},"660":{"dur":5,"text":"And I should have figured out some of these."},"665":{"dur":1,"text":"You want to count teeth."},"666":{"dur":6,"text":"I don't know how many times over the years,\nI've ended up with more teeth than I needed--or"},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"maybe too few."},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"So you count."},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"Nothing wrong with that."},"679":{"dur":4,"text":"And so now I'm going to go ahead and because\nthis is affecting--the smile--is affecting"},"684":{"dur":4,"text":"the whole face, it's making this go deeper\nhere too."},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"Not as deep as this."},"690":{"dur":7,"text":"But now I want to take out that edge, that\nline that was sitting there and wasn't interpreted"},"697":{"dur":1,"text":"or described."},"698":{"dur":5,"text":"And I want to take that and show that there's\na shadow coming this way."},"704":{"dur":10,"text":"Ok, so now maybe we can see a few things that\nare a little bit different."},"714":{"dur":4,"text":"You see that there's this form to the chin."},"719":{"dur":8,"text":"This is really important because all I have\nto do is indicate a little bit of a turn there"},"728":{"dur":4,"text":"and suddenly I have a chin."},"732":{"dur":1,"text":"Something I can maybe work off of."},"733":{"dur":4,"text":"I know there's probably a contour up here\nthat I can take advantage of but I don't want"},"737":{"dur":4,"text":"to suggest it as a line."},"742":{"dur":7,"text":"But this little corner here is what will help\nas a catalyst for showing a little more form"},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"to her face."},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"So now we see this here."},"754":{"dur":5,"text":"Just to start looking--it could be this or\nmany other things in a picture--but this is"},"760":{"dur":1,"text":"not straight."},"761":{"dur":4,"text":"Just observe what you're drawing and you see\nhow this one is curved."},"766":{"dur":1,"text":"It comes down like this."},"768":{"dur":2,"text":"And it actually meets, you know, closer to\nthe face."},"771":{"dur":12,"text":"This one is just straight so let's just see\nwhat we could do if we did that."},"783":{"dur":5,"text":"And the reason that some of these things become\nimportant, to me, is because I can always"},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"see something else in relationship to that."},"792":{"dur":5,"text":"And it just helps me to start doing a better\nand better job of constructing my picture,"},"797":{"dur":4,"text":"to getting good proportions, to be able to\nsee the perspective and the dimension, and"},"802":{"dur":6,"text":"all those things that are going to make your\npicture so special and help it have impact"},"809":{"dur":6,"text":"when people look at it."},"815":{"dur":5,"text":"You can have, actually, a very simple drawing\nand yet if you have some of these things that"},"821":{"dur":7,"text":"are easily obtained and included in your picture,\nyou can have these transform your picture"},"828":{"dur":3,"text":"into something completely different than what\nyou thought."},"832":{"dur":3,"text":"Very effective."},"836":{"dur":3,"text":"Ok."},"839":{"dur":5,"text":"So now I could come in here."},"844":{"dur":5,"text":"I don't want to get too dark and one of the\nthings you have to be careful with is to build"},"850":{"dur":2,"text":"the values like I've talked about."},"852":{"dur":5,"text":"You don't want to just start adding dark because\nyou think, 'Well, it needs to be dark."},"858":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm just going as dark as I have to or I can.'"},"861":{"dur":4,"text":"Because you always want to be able to have\nsomething a little darker so that even within"},"866":{"dur":6,"text":"black areas and very dark areas you can show\ncontour and depth."},"873":{"dur":5,"text":"So let's look at a couple more things and\nwe'll put this away here."},"878":{"dur":7,"text":"Oh, I can't--it's very difficult to make it\nso you can see everything in here."},"885":{"dur":7,"text":"These lines--I know it's a quick and easy\nway to get an initial drawing going, but I"},"892":{"dur":4,"text":"just want to encourage you to interpret your\nlines."},"897":{"dur":1,"text":"Otherwise it becomes more like a coloring\nbook."},"899":{"dur":1,"text":"And coloring books are fun."},"901":{"dur":2,"text":"But if you want something realistic and you\nwant to have the experience of seeing what"},"904":{"dur":7,"text":"can happen, I hope you'll try this."},"911":{"dur":2,"text":"You might even practice in a coloring book."},"913":{"dur":4,"text":"A coloring book is something that you can\nuse that line except for the fact that it's"},"918":{"dur":6,"text":"black and it's so harsh and it doesn't make\nany difference what you do, you'll still see"},"925":{"dur":1,"text":"the line."},"926":{"dur":4,"text":"But we don't want a coloring book here."},"930":{"dur":3,"text":"We want it to be edges to value."},"933":{"dur":5,"text":"Now once I have the drop shadow below the\nnose because the nose is sticking out away"},"939":{"dur":1,"text":"from the face."},"940":{"dur":1,"text":"It has dimension."},"941":{"dur":3,"text":"And it is going to naturally cast a shadow\non the face."},"945":{"dur":5,"text":"Then it gives me an opportunity, as well,\nto shade the nose up and give a little more"},"950":{"dur":2,"text":"dimension to the nose as well."},"953":{"dur":7,"text":"So I can back from that edge as long as I\nmaintain this edge and I maintain this dimension"},"960":{"dur":1,"text":"that I've developed here."},"961":{"dur":5,"text":"I may have to go and reinforce it so that\nI can, again, take my value and contour the"},"967":{"dur":5,"text":"nose up.Alright, so now this is something\nelse here."},"972":{"dur":3,"text":"You'll see that the lips and the gums, there's\nno separation."},"976":{"dur":1,"text":"This is something that I do."},"977":{"dur":2,"text":"I like to come in here and decide."},"980":{"dur":4,"text":"Sometimes it's hard to see but I like to decide\nwhere is the edge of the lip and then I'll"},"984":{"dur":6,"text":"create a clean edge and I'll come down so\nthat I have something past the lip."},"991":{"dur":2,"text":"There's actually gums past the lip."},"994":{"dur":6,"text":"And it gives me a quick, quick opportunity\nto show dimension."},"1001":{"dur":3,"text":"And then I can go ahead and shade the teeth\njust a little bit too."},"1004":{"dur":3,"text":"Just like I would the whites of the eyes or\nanything."},"1007":{"dur":3,"text":"I can come down here and show that they're\nin the shade."},"1011":{"dur":5,"text":"And when I do that, it gives me the opportunity\nto take a highlight out of my teeth."},"1016":{"dur":3,"text":"Sometimes it gets very difficult to have enough\nvalue to show dimension in the teeth."},"1019":{"dur":1,"text":"And you don't want to try too hard."},"1020":{"dur":5,"text":"You want to kind of let it happen all by itself\nwithout having to draw too much."},"1025":{"dur":5,"text":"But it's very easy to end up with teeth that\nlook pretty scary because they have dark lines"},"1031":{"dur":1,"text":"in between."},"1033":{"dur":10,"text":"And this way we can create enough value around\nthem that they will just naturally contrast,"},"1043":{"dur":5,"text":"over time, with the rest of the face, the\nrest of the values you have in there."},"1049":{"dur":4,"text":"And then I have an opportunity to add a little\nvalue here and there because I want to be"},"1053":{"dur":3,"text":"able to show that this is a round set of teeth."},"1056":{"dur":2,"text":"The ones in the front are forward."},"1058":{"dur":4,"text":"The ones that are going back into the mouth\nare in there where there's less light again."},"1063":{"dur":5,"text":"So I can put a little value in some of these\nplaces, showing that they actually do indeed"},"1068":{"dur":2,"text":"go back in towards the mouth."},"1071":{"dur":5,"text":"So let's take a look a little bit more at\nthe baby here."},"1077":{"dur":7,"text":"And I'm going to put a highlight in the eyes."},"1084":{"dur":13,"text":"Ok, let's go ahead and use this line here\non the edge of the jacket and create--use"},"1098":{"dur":5,"text":"that as an edge to value so that we have that\nline interpreted."},"1103":{"dur":7,"text":"We don't want to just have a nondescript line\nthere."},"1111":{"dur":5,"text":"And then we can take the mouth and we can\nshow that the top lip is shading the bottom"},"1117":{"dur":3,"text":"lip."},"1120":{"dur":7,"text":"And I want to be able to come over here and\nwatch this go back and behind the hood of"},"1127":{"dur":3,"text":"this jacket or collar or whatever it is."},"1131":{"dur":4,"text":"And when I have a chance to conclude something\nlike this and show an ending, it gives me"},"1135":{"dur":11,"text":"a wonderful opportunity to demonstrate depth.Over\nhere on the baby's eye, look at the tear duct"},"1146":{"dur":4,"text":"here, how this is recessed back in there."},"1151":{"dur":5,"text":"And the white is not appearing as big as it\nis in this drawing."},"1156":{"dur":2,"text":"I want to show that this nose is shading the\nface."},"1159":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'll put the soft side on this side."},"1162":{"dur":4,"text":"And we start having a little dimension to\nthe nose."},"1167":{"dur":4,"text":"This one is going to be shaded this way."},"1171":{"dur":4,"text":"Then we have the nose, the nostril, that can\nbe shaded this way."},"1175":{"dur":1,"text":"See what Mom is doing here."},"1177":{"dur":5,"text":"Yeah I think we kind of caught Mom enough\njust enough to show you."},"1182":{"dur":1,"text":"This is interesting here too."},"1184":{"dur":5,"text":"Because you'll see that she has a darker bridge\nto her nose and then there is this across"},"1189":{"dur":3,"text":"the brow here--I mean between the two eyes."},"1192":{"dur":6,"text":"And that's very normal to have a little bit\nof a recess there."},"1199":{"dur":3,"text":"And it keeps everything from becoming flat."},"1203":{"dur":2,"text":"Because everything that's the same color will\nbe flat."},"1205":{"dur":5,"text":"And if this is part of a common contour in\na person, we don't necessarily want to leave"},"1211":{"dur":1,"text":"that out."},"1212":{"dur":3,"text":"And when I start looking at this thing, I\nsee maybe the eyelashes as I look--or the"},"1216":{"dur":1,"text":"eyebrows."},"1217":{"dur":3,"text":"As I look up here, I see that these quit."},"1221":{"dur":1,"text":"As I look up here, they're way over here."},"1222":{"dur":2,"text":"So maybe we could put a little more here."},"1225":{"dur":2,"text":"This changes the construction of her face\nas well."},"1227":{"dur":7,"text":"Need to use my tapered stroke in here."},"1234":{"dur":4,"text":"Just a little bit of an idea of what you can\ndo to make sure that things are placed in"},"1239":{"dur":2,"text":"your picture properly."},"1242":{"dur":3,"text":"And if it's shaded, you can push them back."},"1245":{"dur":4,"text":"And if it's a highlight and something out\nin front, you can pull it forward."},"1249":{"dur":5,"text":"And you can have this opportunity to place\nthings where you want so that you're in control"},"1255":{"dur":1,"text":"of your drawing."},"1256":{"dur":4,"text":"And you'll have a lot better interpretation\nbesides.Let's go ahead and see what we started"},"1261":{"dur":1,"text":"out with."},"1262":{"dur":5,"text":"And maybe

good."},"1275":{"dur":3,"text":"Put the baby out here."},"1279":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe it's enough that you can get a little\nbetter of an idea."},"1281":{"dur":1,"text":"This comes across as quite bright."},"1283":{"dur":1,"text":"We could push that back."},"1284":{"dur":2,"text":"It's being shaded by Mom's cheek."},"1286":{"dur":2,"text":"And so those kind of things we have
