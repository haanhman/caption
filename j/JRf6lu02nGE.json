interesting."},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'm happy to answer\nquestions on it later"},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"as we get through the talk."},"370":{"dur":7,"text":"So the state of play in\nbusiness

answer."},"392":{"dur":4,"text":"But the purpose of business and\nwhat the purpose of a company"},"396":{"dur":3,"text":"really is a very, very\ninteresting question."},"399":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think since at\nleast the '40s or '50s,"},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"the answer to that has been\ndriven by this sort of Milton"},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"Friedman free market\ncapitalist

Milton Friedman."},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"If you actually look\nat this quote here,"},"421":{"dur":3,"text":"this line is very\ninteresting, \"while conforming"},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"to the basic rules of\nsociety, both embodied"},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"in law and in ethical custom.\""},"430":{"dur":3,"text":"That immediately raises a\nton of questions about how"},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"business should be operating."},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"And elsewhere,\nMilton Friedman also"},"437":{"dur":3,"text":"said if a company is\noperating in a community,"},"441":{"dur":3,"text":"it may be sensible and\nwise to make investments"},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"into that community."},"446":{"dur":3,"text":"So you can make the argument\nthat Milton Friedman's views"},"450":{"dur":3,"text":"are perfectly compatible\nwith a sustainable"},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"approach to business,\nparticularly if you"},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"take a longer-term\nview rather than"},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"a short-term quarterly\nreporting view."},"460":{"dur":4,"text":"But anyway, this sort\nof simplified concept,"},"464":{"dur":4,"text":"the idea of survival of the\nfittest, it's just business,"},"469":{"dur":4,"text":"business ethics is an\noxymoron arguably--"},"473":{"dur":6,"text":"and I think this is still\nthe dominant view today."},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"And we can talk about\nthe kind of pressures"},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"that that view is\nunder, but if you"},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"watched the Trump-Clinton\ndebate on

housing\nmarket collapse,"},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"because that's just business."},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"It's very interesting\nto watch him"},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"that he kind of reverts to\nthese arguments about what"},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"I am doing is ethically\nneutral, because it's just"},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"a question of business."},"504":{"dur":3,"text":"You can see how hopefully\nuntenable that position"},"508":{"dur":1,"text":"will be for Trump."},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"But I think once\nyou kind of start"},"511":{"dur":3,"text":"to think about how\nbusinesses operate"},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"and justify what\nthey're doing, there"},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"is throughout the\nprivate sector still"},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"at the moment this idea\nthat maximizing value"},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"for shareholders is\nethically neutral."},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"It doesn't have an\nethical dimension."},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"And yes, if we can do\nsomething else, that's fine."},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"But beyond legal\ncompliance, business"},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"does not have ethical\nresponsibilities."},"535":{"dur":3,"text":"And you can also see\nthat because in most"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"large multinationals,\nethics and compliance"},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"is the name of a department."},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"So basically what\nthat's saying is"},"545":{"dur":3,"text":"it's drawing an equivalence\nbetween legal compliance"},"549":{"dur":1,"text":"and business ethics."},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's saying, as long\nas we adhere to the law,"},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"we don't have wider\nethical responsibilities."},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"The fact that the ownership\nof business ethics"},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"sits with a bunch of\ncompliance officers and lawyers"},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"is in itself a very, very\ninteresting question."},"565":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think I'm going to argue,\nand I suspect many of you"},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"would agree with me, that this\nis no longer a sustainable"},"572":{"dur":6,"text":"position, and that businesses\nneed to in some way"},"578":{"dur":3,"text":"address wider ethical,\nsocial, environmental,"},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"and governance questions."},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"The problem is\nthat once you start"},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"to think about how\nthey might do that,"},"587":{"dur":3,"text":"the situation gets a lot,\nlot more complicated."},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think one of the\nreasons this view that's"},"593":{"dur":3,"text":"outlined on this slide has\ndominated is that it's simple."},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"It gives companies a\nway to make decisions."},"598":{"dur":0,"text":"It's profit."},"599":{"dur":1,"text":"It's quarterly reports."},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"And once you start to\nsay, well, actually"},"603":{"dur":1,"text":"what is the role of\nbusiness and what's"},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"the role of the public\nsector, everything"},"607":{"dur":3,"text":"starts to get muddy\nand complicated."},"610":{"dur":3,"text":"But I think really given\nthe state of the world,"},"613":{"dur":4,"text":"we need to kind of\ntackle these questions."},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going to come back to\nthe themes on this slide"},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"in a lot more detail\nlater, so this is just"},"622":{"dur":3,"text":"to kind of skip through\nthem briefly at the moment."},"626":{"dur":3,"text":"I would say unarguably that the\nrelationship between business"},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"and society is changing and\nthis dominant paradigm is"},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"coming under more\nintense pressure arguably"},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"than ever before."},"637":{"dur":3,"text":"So we've got mounting\neconomic, social, political,"},"640":{"dur":2,"text":"and environmental\nchallenges, climate change,"},"643":{"dur":5,"text":"income inequality, huge amount\nof political disruption,"},"649":{"dur":4,"text":"et cetera, et cetera, just\nover the migrant labor,"},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"terrorism, et cetera."},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"So are the challenges worse\nthan they've ever been before?"},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't know."},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"I think you can make an\nargument that they are."},"662":{"dur":5,"text":"We've certainly got collapsing\npublic trust in business."},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"Newspapers love to\ntalk about millennials"},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"and what you need to do to\nmotivate millennials and keep"},"673":{"dur":1,"text":"millennials in your company."},"675":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's a huge\nbody of research"},"676":{"dur":4,"text":"that behaving more responsibly\nand having a more responsible"},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"ethical culture\nis the way to keep"},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"fabled millennials engaged."},"686":{"dur":4,"text":"So public collapsing trust in\nbusiness, also in government"},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"as an aside."},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"But there are\nhorrifying statistics."},"693":{"dur":1,"text":"It's really at an\nall-time low, and I"},"695":{"dur":4,"text":"think there are very\ngood reasons for that."},"699":{"dur":3,"text":"Increased expectations\non corporate transparency"},"702":{"dur":0,"text":"and ethics."},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"I think again that's\nfairly obvious."},"706":{"dur":4,"text":"I think this is connected\nto the next box over,"},"711":{"dur":3,"text":"which is what we might\ncall hyper-transparency"},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"or the rise of the\ninternet has meant"},"716":{"dur":4,"text":"that it's very, very difficult\nat this point for a company"},"720":{"dur":4,"text":"to reliably control its public\nprofile and its reputation."},"724":{"dur":1,"text":"Stories can go viral."},"726":{"dur":1,"text":"Things that would have\nbeen local

what\nhappened in Qatar,"},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"these issues are not\nissues that a company"},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"can manage or manipulate through\nPR anymore because of what's"},"742":{"dur":3,"text":"happened with IT effectively."},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"And then there's a\ngrowing role of business"},"749":{"dur":1,"text":"in sustainability issues."},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"I think COP 21, the climate\nchange negotiations there,"},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"a recognition that business\nneeded to be at the table"},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"and have a say really\nfor the first time."},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"And then increasing\ninvestor interest"},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"in what investors\ncall ESG, so that's"},"764":{"dur":4,"text":"Economic-- no, Environmental,\nSocial and Governance issues,"},"768":{"dur":2,"text":"and this idea that\ninvestors want"},"771":{"dur":3,"text":"to measure ESG responsibility\nis kind of gaining momentum."},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"I and many other people\nwould make the argument"},"778":{"dur":3,"text":"that good ESG management is\nactually just good management,"},"781":{"dur":4,"text":"but that's a conversation\nwe can get into later."},"786":{"dur":3,"text":"So unarguably, these pressures\non companies are increasing"},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"and companies are\nfeeling the pressure"},"791":{"dur":2,"text":"and feeling that\nthey have to respond."},"794":{"dur":1,"text":"We can certainly\nmake the argument"},"795":{"dur":3,"text":"that there's a need for a\nmore collaborative, inclusive,"},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"and deeper engagement\nwith society."},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"The question is\nreally how to do that."},"806":{"dur":7,"text":"So this is a diagram\nthat sort of describes"},"813":{"dur":4,"text":"how companies today are treating\nbusiness and ethical questions."},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"I've talked about\nethics and compliance"},"821":{"dur":3,"text":"already as a department\nand the department that"},"824":{"dur":3,"text":"owns ethical questions."},"827":{"dur":4,"text":"But this is the area\nwhere you would expect"},"832":{"dur":3,"text":"to see kind of\ncontrols and processes"},"835":{"dur":4,"text":"around areas where there is\nalready a legal framework, so"},"839":{"dur":5,"text":"corporate governance, corruption\nis a huge one, sanctions, money"},"845":{"dur":1,"text":"laundering."},"846":{"dur":2,"text":"And the role of this\ndepartment tends"},"849":{"dur":3,"text":"to be quite technical\nand quite process-driven."},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"So this will be\nlawyers on the whole,"},"854":{"dur":2,"text":"or accountants who are\nputting in place processes"},"857":{"dur":4,"text":"to help companies meet\nlegal requirements."},"861":{"dur":3,"text":"And they also have ownership\nof these ethical questions."},"864":{"dur":3,"text":"But clearly, meeting\nlegal requirements"},"867":{"dur":4,"text":"is only going to kind\nof get you so far."},"871":{"dur":2,"text":"And so the other\ndepartment in companies"},"874":{"dur":3,"text":"that tackles ethical questions,\nthough does not actually"},"878":{"dur":3,"text":"tend to frame them in ethical\nterms, is sustainability."},"882":{"dur":1,"text":"And it can be called CSR."},"884":{"dur":2,"text":"It can be called\ncorporate responsibility."},"886":{"dur":2,"text":"It's sometimes called\ncorporate citizenship."},"889":{"dur":3,"text":"But there is\nincreasingly a team that"},"893":{"dur":6,"text":"covers issues that are not yet\nlaw but are ethical questions."},"900":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can also think\nof this as a trajectory."},"902":{"dur":3,"text":"So when something starts\nto be of public concern"},"906":{"dur":3,"text":"and starts to be an\nissue that companies"},"910":{"dur":1,"text":"feel they need to\nengage and tackle on,"},"911":{"dur":2,"text":"it tends to sit\nin sustainability."},"914":{"dur":4,"text":"Once the issue starts to\nget into policy and law,"},"918":{"dur":2,"text":"it tends to move into\nethics and compliance."},"921":{"dur":3,"text":"So you can think about\ncorruption in this sense."},"924":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, corruption used to be\ntax-deductible in Germany"},"927":{"dur":1,"text":"in the late '90s."},"928":{"dur":2,"text":"It's been illegal in\nthe US for a long time"},"931":{"dur":1,"text":"by the Foreign\nCorrupt Practices Act,"},"932":{"dur":3,"text":"but nobody really\nenforced that Act."},"936":{"dur":4,"text":"But as the legal regime\naround corruption got tighter,"},"940":{"dur":3,"text":"it became more of an ethics\nand compliance question."},"943":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's now a\nvery established kind"},"946":{"dur":3,"text":"of approach for how\ncompanies treat compliance,"},"949":{"dur":2,"text":"treat anti-corruption\ncompliance,"},"952":{"dur":5,"text":"whereas something like carbon\nemissions or human rights"},"957":{"dur":4,"text":"or labor rights or diversity,\nwomen's empowerment,"},"961":{"dur":5,"text":"inclusive economies,\nbiodiversity, stakeholder"},"966":{"dur":4,"text":"engagement, these kind of--\nthey usually are regarded"},"970":{"dur":2,"text":"as softer, fluffier concepts."},"972":{"dur":3,"text":"And the idea is not that\nthere's no laws around this,"},"975":{"dur":2,"text":"but there isn't an\naccepted legal framework"},"977":{"dur":2,"text":"and how companies\nshould behave is not"},"980":{"dur":1,"text":"set by the legal framework."},"982":{"dur":2,"text":"Those issues tend\nto sit over here."},"984":{"dur":3,"text":"So what you have at the moment\nis a sustainability department"},"987":{"dur":4,"text":"covering the softer emerging\nissues of public concern."},"992":{"dur":2,"text":"And then once it\nbecomes a legal issue,"},"994":{"dur":2,"text":"it sits in ethics\nand compliance."},"997":{"dur":4,"text":"And what this results in is\na kind of a lack of alignment"},"1002":{"dur":2,"text":"and messaging and thinking\naround ethical questions"},"1005":{"dur":3,"text":"like, what's the\npurpose of a company?"},"1008":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think

expression"},"1030":{"dur":2,"text":"of the industry that\nthey're in quite a lot."},"1033":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think the open\nquestion for the future"},"1036":{"dur":2,"text":"is, if these
