minutes,"},"432":{"dur":4,"text":"I would counteract the effect I just\ngave of increasing your heart rate."},"436":{"dur":1,"text":"This will reduce your heart rate."},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"About 12

space."},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"One size does not fit all."},"597":{"dur":3,"text":"The problem with open plan\nis when it's all open plan."},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"Because then there's no\nwhere to

one."},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, that is interesting."},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you'd said to\nthe people leaving this shop,"},"735":{"dur":3,"text":"did you buy that bottle of

unconscious,\nwith suppressing sound all the time."},"746":{"dur":3,"text":"And yet, this is the kind of\naffect it's having on behavior."},"749":{"dur":3,"text":"If that's what design sound can do,\njust think of what the accidental"},"752":{"dur":4,"text":"unpleasant sound is doing to customers,\nand to all of us in our daily lives."},"756":{"dur":4,"text":"So really, this is a plea to all
