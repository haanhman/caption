epigenetics,"},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"much as you've seen here\nin the case of mice."},"637":{"dur":4,"text":"Another important point\nto make about epigenetics is"},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"that these

generations,"},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"Epigenetic marks can be passed down."},"743":{"dur":4,"text":"Another thing to know about epigenetics\nis that they don't just affect us"},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"when we're a developing embryo,"},"750":{"dur":4,"text":"or when the sperm and egg\nthat conceived us were developing,"},"754":{"dur":3,"text":"they can also affect us

rat\nhas in this region of the brain,"},"786":{"dur":3,"text":"the better it will handle stress."},"789":{"dur":3,"text":"There are studies that have shown\nthat interactions"},"792":{"dur":5,"text":"between a rat mother and her pups\nduring the first week of their life"},"798":{"dur":5,"text":"can have long-term consequences\nfor how much glucacorticoid receptor"},"803":{"dur":3,"text":"those pups will grow up\nto have in their brains"},"806":{"dur":3,"text":"and therefore how well\nthey will handle stress."},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"This is how this works."},"811":{"dur":4,"text":"When rat pups are born,\ntheir glucacorticoid receptor gene"},"816":{"dur":4,"text":"is surrounded by a number of these\nsilencing Epigenetic marks."},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"This effectively turns the gene off."},"823":{"dur":6,"text":"Yet, if a rat mother extensively\nlicks and grooms on her pups,"},"829":{"dur":4,"text":"basically takes good care of them,\nduring the first week of their life,"},"834":{"dur":4,"text":"those Epigenetic silencing marks\ncan be removed from the gene."},"839":{"dur":4,"text":"This allows the glucacoid receptor gene\nto turn back on,"},"843":{"dur":4,"text":"and it stays on in those pups' brains\nthroughout their lives."},"847":{"dur":2,"text":"So they grow up to be\nwell-adjusted animals"},"850":{"dur":1,"text":"who deal well with stress."},"853":{"dur":3,"text":"If a rat mother ignores her pups"},"857":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"858":{"dur":5,"text":"that glucacoid

lives."},"869":{"dur":3,"text":"These rats will grow up to be\nvery anxious in stressful situations."},"875":{"dur":4,"text":"This actually brings up a really\nencouraging point about epigenetics"},"880":{"dur":4,"text":"in that Epigenetic marks are reversible."},"884":{"dur":2,"text":"So, if you've been sitting in the audience"},"886":{"dur":3,"text":"cursing your parents and your

be affected or turned on\nby aberrant Epigenetic marks."},"921":{"dur":2,"text":"This is how this can work."},"923":{"dur":5,"text":"Our bodies have certain genes in them\ncalled tumor-suppressor genes."},"929":{"dur":4,"text":"The job of these genes is to protect cells\nfrom becoming cancerous."},"934":{"dur":6,"text":"But if too many silencing Epigenetic marks\nstart to accumulate around these genes,"},"941":{"dur":1,"text":"the genes get turned off,"},"943":{"dur":4,"text":"and they can no longer perform\ntheir job of protecting the cell."},"948":{"dur":4,"text":"So scientists have developed drugs\nwhich have undergone FDA approval,"},"953":{"dur":5,"text":"and they're in a clinical setting,\nwhich can target these silencing marks"},"958":{"dur":4,"text":"effectively removing them\nfrom the tumor-suppressor genes"},"963":{"dur":5,"text":"and allowing these genes to go back\nto their job of protecting the cell."},"968":{"dur":1,"text":"Now think about
