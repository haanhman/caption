just--"},"59":{"dur":1,"text":"they're not grains because\nthey're wheat."},"60":{"dur":4,"text":"They're just grains because\nthese little blobs of goodness"},"65":{"dur":3,"text":"that are really

because"},"144":{"dur":2,"text":"there's just no minerals\nin there."},"146":{"dur":2,"text":"So the kefir hasn't got\nanything to work with."},"149":{"dur":2,"text":"So spring water is

another idea\nthat we can go into."},"187":{"dur":5,"text":"So we're going to start off\nwith our coconut sugar."},"192":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, you can use white,\nrefined sugar."},"194":{"dur":2,"text":"But if we're using sugar,\nideally, we want to be using"},"196":{"dur":3,"text":"the most nutritious source\nor version of"},"200":{"dur":2,"text":"sugar that we can

sugar."},"208":{"dur":4,"text":"And what I found is that, to\ngrow these grains really"},"213":{"dur":3,"text":"quickly, a mix of two different\ntypes of sugar, so"},"216":{"dur":0,"text":"we've got the coconut."},"217":{"dur":2,"text":"And we've got organic,\nblackstrap molasses her."},"220":{"dur":2,"text":"So the molasses is the most\nnutritional part that's left"},"223":{"dur":2,"text":"over of the sugar."},"226":{"dur":1,"text":"And you can see it's\nreally sticky."},"227":{"dur":4,"text":"But once it's been here--\nideally, we'd leave it in"},"232":{"dur":3,"text":"there for about 30 minutes, just\nto kind of soak in there."},"236":{"dur":2,"text":"And once it's been in there\nabout 30 minutes, you'd be"},"239":{"dur":0,"text":"able to stir it up."},"240":{"dur":1,"text":"And it would dissolve."},"241":{"dur":2,"text":"But for the purposes\nof the video--"},"244":{"dur":1,"text":"you can spend all\nday doing this."},"246":{"dur":2,"text":"For the purposes of the video,\nI'm just going to put the"},"248":{"dur":1,"text":"grains straight in there."},"250":{"dur":1,"text":"And not let it soak."},"251":{"dur":1,"text":"And we'll stir it afterwards."},"253":{"dur":3,"text":"So the final part of the\njigsaw, if you like, is"},"256":{"dur":2,"text":"bicarbonate of soda."},"259":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm going to use an eighth\nof a teaspoon of"},"261":{"dur":1,"text":"bicarbonate of soda."},"263":{"dur":3,"text":"And what this does is keeps\nthe pH of the liquid just"},"266":{"dur":2,"text":"right during the

just give\nthat a little stir."},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"As I said, if that had been\nsitting in there for longer at"},"282":{"dur":3,"text":"this point, the molasses would\nhave dissolved

we"},"321":{"dur":1,"text":"come to do that."},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"But if you're unsure,\njust use plastic."},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"So in they go."},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, at this point, they\nwere just kind"},"330":{"dur":1,"text":"of fall to the bottom."},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"And what we need to do is--"},"337":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll take this off of\nthe one I'm going to"},"339":{"dur":2,"text":"But I just like to use\na nut milk bag."},"342":{"dur":1,"text":"If you're into raw food, you're\nprobably quite familiar"},"343":{"dur":1,"text":"with a nut milk

days."},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"So two days is really\nthe ideal."},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"You can sometimes get away\nwith three days."},"366":{"dur":3,"text":"But if you do too many three-day\nfermentations,"},"369":{"dur":0,"text":"you're going to ruin\nthe grains."},"370":{"dur":3,"text":"They just tend to not thrive\nin liquid for too long."},"373":{"dur":3,"text":"And actually also, two days, as\nfar as taste and probiotic"},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"culture is concerned,\nis really ideal"},"380":{"dur":0,"text":"and growth as well."},"381":{"dur":2,"text":"And what you're going to\nprobably find is that, over"},"383":{"dur":3,"text":"the two days, you get between\n100% and 150% growth."},"387":{"dur":3,"text":"So you should find that your\ngrains at least double."},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, what you'll also find after\nabout 24 hours is that"},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"these grains start to kind\nof rise up to the top."},"396":{"dur":3,"text":"As they produce gas, as they\ngrow, they all kind of rise up"},"399":{"dur":3,"text":"You might find them suspended\nhalfway between the top and"},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"the bottom, also floating\naround on the top."},"405":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's a good sign."},"407":{"dur":1,"text":"It just means they're\nproducing gas."},"408":{"dur":0,"text":"They're growing."},"409":{"dur":3,"text":"And actually, you can sit and\nsee them kind of moving up and"},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"down after 24 hours."},"415":{"dur":1,"text":"It really looks like\na living thing."},"416":{"dur":5,"text":"So this is kind of what you'll\nget, the point you'll get to."},"422":{"dur":1,"text":"As you can see, we've\ngot some grains"},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"floating on the top here."},"426":{"dur":3,"text":"When kind of put it down, you\nmight notice that, when you do"},"430":{"dur":3,"text":"that in your mixture, that you\nget the bubbles coming up, the"},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"gas bubble from the grains\ndown in the bottom there."},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"And you can probably see\nthem kind of floating"},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"around there as well."},"441":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's all a good sign that\nyou've had some growth."},"444":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, what we need to do from\nhere is the strain them off."},"449":{"dur":4,"text":"So you can see what the fully\ngrown grains look like."},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"So as I mentioned, I'm just\ngoing to use a plastic"},"459":{"dur":4,"text":"strainer and strain those off."},"476":{"dur":0,"text":"OK."},"477":{"dur":3,"text":"And then you get that\nresulting kind of--"},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"they look like bigger blobs at\nthis point, because they've"},"482":{"dur":0,"text":"been growing."},"483":{"dur":1,"text":"And they kind of\nstick together."},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"So from there you just want to\ngive these a quick wash off."},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"Again, I do know people that\nhave done this with tap water"},"491":{"dur":0,"text":"and done OK."},"492":{"dur":1,"text":"But I just prefer a little bit\nof spring water over there,"},"494":{"dur":0,"text":"give them a quick wash."},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"You can see they're a little bit\ndarker than the ones I'm"},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"going to show you in a second\nthat have been in coconut"},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"water, because they take on\nthe colour of that sugar."},"502":{"dur":3,"text":"And now these, you'll get to a\npoint, probably, when you're"},"505":{"dur":0,"text":"growing them."},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"And you won't know what\nto do with them."},"508":{"dur":1,"text":"So you won't have anyone\nyou can give them to."},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"And you won't need\nto use them."},"511":{"dur":3,"text":"So you can keep them actually\njust in a mixture of water and"},"515":{"dur":4,"text":"sugar, so six cups of water with\njust a little bit sugar"},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"to keep them fed and put\nthem in the fridge."},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"You can keep like a week\nin that condition."},"524":{"dur":1,"text":"Or you can actually\nfreeze them."},"526":{"dur":3,"text":"You can freeze them for\nup to six months."},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"The thing about when you\nunfreeze them is, it's going"},"531":{"dur":4,"text":"to take a good couple of batches\nto get them reignited,"},"535":{"dur":0,"text":"if you like."},"536":{"dur":3,"text":"So they've been in the deep\nfreeze for a while."},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"When you do this over and over\nagain, it's going to take care"},"542":{"dur":4,"text":"probably three to four weeks to\nkeep doing that a couple of"},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"times a week to really get\nthem started again."},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"So you've got options."},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"Or you can start up your own\nlittle cottage industry"},"552":{"dur":3,"text":"selling them on eBay like\neveryone else seems to do,"},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"which is a good thing because\nit means everyone can get"},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"access to the kefir grains."},"559":{"dur":4,"text":"So this liquid, like\nI said, you can"},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"put this into smoothies."},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"It doesn't taste amazing\nas it is."},"568":{"dur":3,"text":"But what we can also do is turn\nit into a ginger beer,"},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"which I've done here."},"574":{"dur":0,"text":"Now, you can probably\nsee there."},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"We've got bubbles forming."},"578":{"dur":4,"text":"And when I open this, you never\nquite know how fizzy"},"583":{"dur":5,"text":"So this has been at room\ntemperature for two days now."},"589":{"dur":4,"text":"And if you get a bottle like\nthis where the top seals"},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"really tightly and doesn't\nlet any gas out--"},"595":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll open that in a minute."},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"But if you get one that doesn't\nlet any gas out,"},"600":{"dur":3,"text":"you're going to end up with\na nicely carbonated drink."},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"So a good strong seal\nis what you need."},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"So I've got my funnel."},"607":{"dur":3,"text":"I'll pop that in there."},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, for the second stage\nfermentation and for extra"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"fizziness, you want to add\na little bit more sugar."},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"And something I didn't mention,\nactually, in that"},"617":{"dur":4,"text":"first part, is that there are\npeople that have done tests on"},"622":{"dur":4,"text":"these things and have weighed\nthe amount of sugar beforehand"},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"and then reduced the liquid down\nand weighed the resulting"},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"sugar at the end of the\nfermentation, at the end of"},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"the two-day process."},"633":{"dur":3,"text":"And it reduces the amount\nof sugar by about 80%."},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you're worried about all\nthe sugar actually, the"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"grains, that's what makes\nthe fermentation happen."},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"They eat the sugar."},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"So we'll put a little\nbit more sugar in"},"646":{"dur":1,"text":"here to get this fizzy."},"651":{"dur":5,"text":"So that's a tablespoon\nof sugar."},"656":{"dur":5,"text":"And then we'll put our sugar\nkefir liquid in there."},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"And then, ideally, we want\nto leave about an"},"683":{"dur":1,"text":"inch from the top."},"685":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can already see\nthere are bubbles"},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"starting to form there."},"695":{"dur":7,"text":"And then I'm going to take some\nginger and cut the skin"},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"off of that."},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"And obviously, you just want\nto cut that down so that it"},"727":{"dur":3,"text":"fits in your bottle."},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"OK, I'm just going to take a\nlittle bit of that liquid out."},"763":{"dur":3,"text":"Obviously, after I've put\nthe ginger in there,"},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"it's taking up space."},"769":{"dur":3,"text":"I just want to leave\nroom for it to"},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"create that gas in there."},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"So again, that just\nfalls to the"},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"bottom, seal it up tightly."},"780":{"dur":4,"text":"And then, once the gas has had\nan effect on it, it rises to"},"785":{"dur":0,"text":"the top like that."},"786":{"dur":1,"text":"So let's get this one opened."},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"And so ideally you want to\ndo this over a sink."},"798":{"dur":5,"text":"Like I said, you can never know\nexactly how fizzy this is"},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"But when you've done this like\nI just did, you can actually"},"807":{"dur":1,"text":"just put that straight\nin the fridge."},"808":{"dur":0,"text":"It will still fizz up."},"809":{"dur":1,"text":"It just slows the\nprocess down."},"811":{"dur":3,"text":"But if you want a really\ncarbonated drink and you want"},"814":{"dur":2,"text":"it quicker, then do it\nat room temperature."},"817":{"dur":3,"text":"And obviously, in the summer,\nyou'll get a much fizzier"},"820":{"dur":1,"text":"drink, because it's\ngenerally warmer."},"822":{"dur":1,"text":"So let's get this one opened."},"824":{"dur":3,"text":"You'll find actually that,\nif you don't want"},"827":{"dur":1,"text":"it to get too fizzy--"},"828":{"dur":0,"text":"there you go."},"829":{"dur":2,"text":"It's starting to fizz up now."},"832":{"dur":1,"text":"If you don't want it to get too\nfizzy, you can come back"},"833":{"dur":2,"text":"to it and burp it every day,\njust let the lid off."},"836":{"dur":3,"text":"And you'll find that the\ngas just escapes."},"840":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's all good."},"841":{"dur":1,"text":"So this will go in\nthe fridge now."},"843":{"dur":5,"text":"And it will actually keep for\nmonths in the fridge."},"848":{"dur":2,"text":"And you know it probably\nwon't last that long."},"850":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'll just enjoy that from the\nfridge as and when I want."},"853":{"dur":1,"text":"And the next thing I'm going to\nshow you how to do is the"},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"coconut water kefir."},"858":{"dur":6,"text":"So the coconut kefir is actually\na lot simpler and"},"864":{"dur":2,"text":"tastier in my opinion."},"866":{"dur":4,"text":"And the reason, as I mentioned,\nwe don't just keep"},"870":{"dur":2,"text":"doing coconut water is, there's\nnot enough sugar in"},"873":{"dur":2,"text":"there really ideally to keep the\ngrains happy and growing."},"875":{"dur":5,"text":"But if you just use one lot of\ngrains and do the sugar water"},"881":{"dur":2,"text":"mix and then do coconut water\nand just alternate between the"},"884":{"dur":2,"text":"two, you'll have some really\nhappy little grains."},"886":{"dur":3,"text":"And they'll just reproduce and\nmake amazing coconut kefir for"},"890":{"dur":1,"text":"you, for the rest\nof their days."},"891":{"dur":1,"text":"They just keep going,\nby the way."},"893":{"dur":3,"text":"The only time they're going to\ndie is if you mistreat them."},"897":{"dur":2,"text":"So look after them, and they'll\ntreat you well."},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"Coconut water, ideally, if you\ncan get Young Thai coconuts,"},"902":{"dur":2,"text":"that would be the premium\nway of doing this."},"905":{"dur":2,"text":"Nutritionally, fresh coconut\nwater is better than the"},"908":{"dur":1,"text":"pasteurised out of the carton."},"910":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm actually using the\npasteurised on for this."},"912":{"dur":4,"text":"Because I couldn't get the\nfresh coconut water."},"916":{"dur":4,"text":"But we're really restructuring\nand re-energizing and adding"},"920":{"dur":3,"text":"our own nutrition to this\nanyway, in terms of culturing"},"924":{"dur":2,"text":"it and adding probiotics\nto it as well."},"927":{"dur":3,"text":"So even if you don't drink\npasteurised coconut water,"},"930":{"dur":3,"text":"using the pasteurised coconut\nwater for this might be"},"934":{"dur":1,"text":"something you want\nto consider."},"935":{"dur":3,"text":"So we've got the coconut\nwater there."},"939":{"dur":0,"text":"Now, you can see\nthe difference."},"940":{"dur":4,"text":"This is a two-day old\nfermentation."},"944":{"dur":1,"text":"And it hasn't reduced."},"945":{"dur":2,"text":"It was just different amounts\nof coconut water in there."},"948":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can see it's\nmuch cloudier."},"951":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's our finished drink."},"952":{"dur":2,"text":"And we'll strain that\noff in a second."},"955":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'll show you how white the\ngrains have got, compared"},"957":{"dur":2,"text":"to the ones that have\nbeen in the sugar."},"960":{"dur":1,"text":"And so it's really\nvery simple."},"962":{"dur":4,"text":"We take our grains, add them\nto the coconut water."},"966":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, I actually\ntend not to add any"},"969":{"dur":1,"text":"sugar at this point."},"971":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll just let them\ndo their thing."},"972":{"dur":1,"text":"You could if you wanted to add\na little bit more sugar."},"974":{"dur":3,"text":"But because we've treated our\ngrains well and we've got them"},"977":{"dur":3,"text":"really active, it's going to be\nabsolutely fine in there."},"984":{"dur":4,"text":"So that again will just go to\none side, two days, 48 hours"},"988":{"dur":4,"text":"at room temperature, again with\na nut milk bag or similar"},"993":{"dur":1,"text":"on the top there."},"997":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's put that to one side."},"1000":{"dur":3,"text":"And now we are ready to\nstrain these off."},"1008":{"dur":5,"text":"So exactly the same as before,\nbut this time, as you can see,"},"1013":{"dur":4,"text":"those grains are much whiter."},"1021":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's how they would look\nif you were using white,"},"1023":{"dur":2,"text":"refined sugar in the\nfirst stage."},"1026":{"dur":2,"text":"That's kind of what they'd\nlook like as well."},"1028":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'll just put those\nto one side."},"1032":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can drink this\njust as it is."},"1035":{"dur":2,"text":"You can keep it really simple\nand just slice up a little bit"},"1037":{"dur":3,"text":"of ginger again, maybe a couple\nof slices of pear and"},"1040":{"dur":2,"text":"just put those in\nthere as
