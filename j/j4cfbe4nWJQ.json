dispute."},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"In the end, it worked out successfully,"},"598":{"dur":3,"text":"but Roosevelt had a Plan B, and the Plan B"},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"was that if his negotiations

Andrew Jackson,"},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"which is a somewhat strange model for him,"},"673":{"dur":3,"text":"but mostly of Abraham Lincoln, and this"},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"is a model of energetic executives"},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"who construed their powers broadly."},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"It also had a psychological dimension"},"685":{"dur":2,"text":"in that Roosevelt thought that
