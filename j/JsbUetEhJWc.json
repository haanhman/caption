want to\nthink about is how"},"200":{"dur":4,"text":"we shift from cooperation\nand competition and back,"},"204":{"dur":3,"text":"and how we find our balance\nas we cooperate and compete."},"208":{"dur":3,"text":"So our book it talks\nabout cooperation."},"212":{"dur":2,"text":"So you think about\nparents raising an infant."},"214":{"dur":3,"text":"They're cooperating at this\nintimate, incredible level."},"218":{"dur":2,"text":"And even as they're the\nquintessential cooperators,"},"221":{"dur":3,"text":"they're also competing,\noften in that same domain,"},"224":{"dur":1,"text":"for things like who\ngets to sleep in,"},"226":{"dur":1,"text":"who changes the diaper."},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"We're often cooperating\nand competing, even"},"230":{"dur":2,"text":"with the people very,\nvery, very close to us."},"233":{"dur":2,"text":"Now it's not just parents."},"235":{"dur":1,"text":"You think about siblings."},"236":{"dur":2,"text":"What could be better\nthan brotherly love?"},"239":{"dur":1,"text":"But also sort of\nquintessentially,"},"240":{"dur":1,"text":"we have sibling rivalry."},"242":{"dur":5,"text":"That is sometimes, the\npeople very close to us"},"247":{"dur":3,"text":"are also ones with whom\nwe most intensely compete."},"250":{"dur":2,"text":"And we might compete for things\nlike financial resources,"},"253":{"dur":1,"text":"but also things like\nanything that's scarce,"},"255":{"dur":2,"text":"like parental\nattention, and so on."},"258":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's a very\nspecial relationship"},"261":{"dur":3,"text":"that I'll come back\nto, and that's twins."},"264":{"dur":2,"text":"And for twins, this idea of\ncooperation and competition"},"267":{"dur":1,"text":"starts quite early."},"269":{"dur":1,"text":"For twins, it starts\nbefore they're born."},"270":{"dur":2,"text":"Actually, in the womb, they're\nboth cooperating and competing"},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"for resources."},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact, we were\ntalking recently,"},"278":{"dur":5,"text":"and somebody told us about when\nthey're watching the twins,"},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"one of the twins was\nkicking the other one."},"286":{"dur":3,"text":"You sort of see that the\ncompetition start really early."},"290":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, at work, we\nneed to collaborate."},"293":{"dur":2,"text":"And so one of our\nchallenges is to figure out,"},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"how do things like\nshare knowledge,"},"297":{"dur":2,"text":"collaborate as a group."},"300":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're collaborating,\nbut at the same time,"},"302":{"dur":3,"text":"once or as we're going\nthrough that, we also"},"306":{"dur":2,"text":"need to balance competition."},"308":{"dur":1,"text":"Who's going to get credit?"},"309":{"dur":1,"text":"Who's going to get promoted?"},"311":{"dur":1,"text":"Who's going to get a raise?"},"313":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're both\ncollaborating and competing"},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"in order to find our balance."},"317":{"dur":2,"text":"So essential theme\nof our book is"},"320":{"dur":3,"text":"that we're cooperating and\ncompeting all the time, often"},"324":{"dur":1,"text":"with the same people."},"326":{"dur":2,"text":"And we need to find our\nbalance as we do this."},"328":{"dur":1,"text":"And so what we'll\ndo is we'll take you"},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"through a couple of ideas\nabout the constructs"},"333":{"dur":3,"text":"that we consider that shift\nus between cooperation"},"336":{"dur":3,"text":"and competition and back."},"340":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're looking to\nfind our balance."},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"We could cooperate too much."},"344":{"dur":3,"text":"We might make ourselves too\nvulnerable to exploitation."},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"We could try somebody\ntoo much, and end up"},"350":{"dur":1,"text":"getting burned by it."},"351":{"dur":1,"text":"But if we compete\ntoo much, we're"},"353":{"dur":1,"text":"going to miss out\non opportunities"},"354":{"dur":2,"text":"to collaborate,\nand expand the pie,"},"357":{"dur":2,"text":"and end up moving\na team forward."},"359":{"dur":1,"text":"But if we find\nthe right balance,"},"361":{"dur":3,"text":"we'll end up doing\nthe very best."},"365":{"dur":1,"text":"Here's the first idea."},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"When we think about\ncomparison, so"},"368":{"dur":3,"text":"if we think about things like,\ndo you make a good salary?"},"372":{"dur":1,"text":"Do you need to\nupdate your kitchen?"},"374":{"dur":0,"text":"Do you drive a nice car?"},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"Is my workspace adequate?"},"380":{"dur":1,"text":"How are my kids doing?"},"382":{"dur":1,"text":"All of those\njudgments are really"},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"hard to assess in the abstract."},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"And instead, we make\nthese relative judgements."},"389":{"dur":3,"text":"So as we're looking for\ncomparisons, as our mind"},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"almost instinctively\nraces to comparisons,"},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"there's some individual\ndifferences that some of us"},"397":{"dur":1,"text":"do this more than others."},"399":{"dur":1,"text":"But we're constantly\nscanning our environment"},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"to figure out, hey,\nhow am I doing?"},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"How are my kids doing?"},"405":{"dur":1,"text":"What do I need?"},"407":{"dur":1,"text":"And we make these comparisons."},"408":{"dur":1,"text":"We might check Facebook."},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"We might ask other people."},"411":{"dur":1,"text":"We might try to\nfigure out what's"},"413":{"dur":5,"text":"going on to the other\npeople's kids around us."},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"So it could be that our\nkids are playing soccer,"},"421":{"dur":5,"text":"and they're young, nobody keeps\nscore, except for the parents."},"426":{"dur":1,"text":"The parents are keeping score."},"428":{"dur":1,"text":"They know who scored the goals."},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"They know which team is winning."},"432":{"dur":2,"text":"And so here, we're\ninstinctively hard wired"},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"to make these comparisons."},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"Larry Bird and Magic\nJohnson, for example,"},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"had a very special\ncompetitive relationship."},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"The special\nrelationship is rivalry."},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"When we have rivals, it's\na really intense form"},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"of competition."},"449":{"dur":1,"text":"And here, Larry\nBird talks about,"},"451":{"dur":1,"text":"\"The first thing I\nwould do every morning"},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"was look at the box scores.\""},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"He wanted to see what\nMagic did, and that to"},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"him was the most\nimportant thing."},"461":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, here's what's\ngood about comparisons."},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"Comparisons can be\npowerfully motivating."},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"We see something."},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"We're comparing ourselves\nwith somebody else."},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"And we're motivated\nby that, and that"},"471":{"dur":1,"text":"can be really constructive."},"473":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's a very healthy\ncomponent to this."},"476":{"dur":1,"text":"So here's the good\nin comparisons."},"478":{"dur":3,"text":"It increases motivation,\ncan boost performance,"},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"and if we can harness\ncooperation in the right way,"},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"it can be very good."},"487":{"dur":3,"text":"But there's some problems\nwith comparisons also."},"490":{"dur":3,"text":"And comparisons can make\nus not only more motivated,"},"493":{"dur":3,"text":"but can make us\nperfectly miserable."},"496":{"dur":1,"text":"And I suggest that these\nare really hard-wired."},"498":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'll show you a short video\nabout how hard-wired they are."},"502":{"dur":4,"text":"This is a study that Frans de\nWaal did with Capuchin monkeys."},"506":{"dur":1,"text":"These monkeys are\nreally quite clever,"},"508":{"dur":5,"text":"and he taught them how to use\nstones as a type of money."},"513":{"dur":1,"text":"So they would use these stones."},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"They'd hand them to the\nexperimenter, and in exchange"},"518":{"dur":0,"text":"get some reward."},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"Now here's what\nwe're going to see."},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"We're going to see a video\nof two Capuchin monkeys side"},"526":{"dur":1,"text":"by side."},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"They both have stones."},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"They're going to hand the\nstone to the experimenter,"},"531":{"dur":1,"text":"and they're going\nto get something."},"533":{"dur":4,"text":"In one cage, one monkey's\ngoing to get cucumbers."},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can do\nthis with monkeys,"},"539":{"dur":1,"text":"and they'll do this all day."},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"They like to eat cucumbers."},"542":{"dur":2,"text":"It's easy enough to\nhand the stones over,"},"544":{"dur":2,"text":"and they'll keep\ngetting these cucumbers."},"547":{"dur":1,"text":"The experiment he\ndid, however, he"},"548":{"dur":3,"text":"put another monkey in the\ncage next to that monkey."},"552":{"dur":4,"text":"And that other monkey, when they\ngive the stone, got a grape."},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, the grape's much\nbetter than a cucumber."},"559":{"dur":1,"text":"And you'll see what happens."},"560":{"dur":0,"text":"[VIDEO PLAYBACK]"},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"-She gives a rock to us."},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"That's the task."},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"And you give her a piece\nof cucumber, and she eats."},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"The other one needs\nto give a rock to us."},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's what she does."},"571":{"dur":3,"text":"And she gets a grape."},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"And see, the other\none sees that."},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"And she gives a rock to\nus and gets a cucumber."},"584":{"dur":3,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"[END PLAYBACK]"},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"MAURICE SCHWEITZER:\nAnd so what it"},"591":{"dur":4,"text":"suggests is that is a\nstone worth a cucumber?"},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, it is until somebody\nelse is getting a grape."},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"So there you see, we could be\nvery happy with our situation,"},"602":{"dur":1,"text":"our station in life."},"603":{"dur":1,"text":"We could be happy\nwith our salary"},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"until we find somebody\nelse is getting more,"},"607":{"dur":4,"text":"and that contrast can make\nus perfectly miserable."},"612":{"dur":4,"text":"So here, what's difficult\nabout comparisons"},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"is they can make us miserable."},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"They can increase\nresentment and spite."},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"And we need to find our balance."},"623":{"dur":4,"text":"And one way we do that is\nto differentiate ourselves."},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"And the classic differentiation\nis among siblings."},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"So I talked about\nsiblings before."},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"Often, siblings will have\nvery similar interests,"},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"but sometimes the\ncomparisons become"},"637":{"dur":3,"text":"so aversive and grating that we\nfind ourselves differentiating"},"641":{"dur":0,"text":"ourselves."},"642":{"dur":4,"text":"So one sibling might be\nreally great at school."},"646":{"dur":0,"text":"Great at math."},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"The other one's like, oh\nwell, I'm really an athlete,"},"650":{"dur":1,"text":"or I'm the artist."},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"And we find ourselves\ndifferentiating ourselves."},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"The most intense comparisons\nhappen with twins."},"657":{"dur":1,"text":"And there have been a\nnumber of twin studies"},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"to really disentangle\nthe differences"},"662":{"dur":4,"text":"between genetic and social\ninfluences on how we develop."},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"And one really interesting\nthing about these twin studies"},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"is that you sometimes\nsee twins that"},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"have been separated at birth."},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"And they grow up in completely\ndifferent environments."},"676":{"dur":4,"text":"And they end up with\nshockingly similar interests."},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"Whereas often growing up, they\nmight have similar interests,"},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"but they end up diverging."},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"And here you find cases\nwhere, yes, people sort of"},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"balance this sort of\nmotivation, resentment,"},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"and find their balance,\nyou end applying things"},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"like these twins,\nseparated at birth."},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"They grew up in completely\nseparate families,"},"698":{"dur":3,"text":"different religions,\ndifferent upbringings."},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"But they ended up having\nidentical interests."},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"They're both 100% into fitness."},"706":{"dur":3,"text":"And in fact, both of them\nown bodybuilding gyms."},"709":{"dur":1,"text":"And when they reconnected\nin their 40's, they"},"711":{"dur":3,"text":"were shocked at how\nsimilar they actually were."},"715":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm going to turn

beat the shit\nout of me in the womb."},"726":{"dur":3,"text":"And when we came out, he\nwas 50% larger than I was."},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"And when I was 12 years\nold, I ran a 10K race"},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"in 46 minutes, which is,\nI think, pretty good."},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"My brother ran it in under 44."},"738":{"dur":2,"text":"And so by the time I was 13,\nI was no longer a runner,"},"740":{"dur":1,"text":"but I was now a wrestler."},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can see how you\ncan change those things."},"745":{"dur":3,"text":"What I want to turn to next is\nanother core topic of something"},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"that we naturally\ncompare ourselves to."},"751":{"dur":1,"text":"When we think about, what\ndo other people have,"},"753":{"dur":1,"text":"we often think about\nthis one dimension"},"755":{"dur":1,"text":"that really matters a lot."},"756":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's power."},"758":{"dur":1,"text":"And one of the key\nideas that we develop"},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"in this book-- and Maurice\nand I have been doing research"},"763":{"dur":4,"text":"on power and social\nhierarchy for over 15 years,"},"767":{"dur":4,"text":"almost 20 years now-- is power\nis a structural variable."},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"When someone has power,\ntechnically what that means"},"774":{"dur":1,"text":"is they control an\nimportant resource"},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"that other people want, or\nthey have a higher level"},"778":{"dur":1,"text":"of authority than other people."},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"They can reward and\npunish other people."},"782":{"dur":4,"text":"And that changes us in\nsome dramatic and intense"},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"physiological and\nneurological ways."},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"But the key insight\nthat we develop"},"792":{"dur":3,"text":"is that structural level\nof power, why it matters,"},"795":{"dur":3,"text":"is because it creates a\npsychological sense of power."},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"And what really matters\nmore than anything else"},"801":{"dur":1,"text":"is the psychological\nsense of power."},"803":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, I want to just\ntel you

presentation,"},"838":{"dur":2,"text":"they gave an opportunity to\nspend some time by herself."},"840":{"dur":1,"text":"And she said, you know\nwhat I'm going to do,"},"842":{"dur":2,"text":"is I'm going to actually\nuse some of Adam's research"},"844":{"dur":1,"text":"and see if it helps me."},"845":{"dur":4,"text":"And she sat down for 15 minutes,\nand she wrote a little

a\nfew things that we can do this."},"2004":{"dur":4,"text":"We might describe\nranges of salaries"},"2009":{"dur":1,"text":"that people are\ngetting, rather than"},"2010":{"dur":2,"text":"making

having accurate information."},"2051":{"dur":1,"text":"And so the United\nStates, for example,"},"2053":{"dur":2,"text":"had an executive order\nof more transparency,"},"2055":{"dur":1,"text":"and what were the\nrates of promotion"},"2057":{"dur":2,"text":"by gender, for example, and\nthey showed an increase."},"2060":{"dur":4,"text":"Australia, what they did is they\ndecided that every company

years"},"2079":{"dur":1,"text":"in management roles."},"2080":{"dur":2,"text":"And so one of the things\nis we talk about is,"},"2082":{"dur":1,"text":"transparency is actually\none of the

make"},"2094":{"dur":1,"text":"people perfectly miserable."},"2096":{"dur":1,"text":"MAURICE SCHWEITZER:\nYeah, miserable."},"2098":{"dur":6,"text":"So I think what's really report\nis to have procedures in place."},"2104":{"dur":1,"text":"You want systematic procedures."},"2106":{"dur":2,"text":"You want a transparent system."},"2109":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's really important."},"2111":{"dur":3,"text":"And we want to think\nabout making broader"},"2114":{"dur":2,"text":"structural changes,\nthere's are some problem,"},"2116":{"dur":4,"text":"that transparency can be really\nhelpful in fixing problems."},"2121":{"dur":3,"text":"Individually, the transparency\nof how much people"},"2124":{"dur":1,"text":"are making, that could\nmake people just

so, I don't\nknow exactly what"},"2143":{"dur":2,"text":"this particular man or this\nparticular woman makes,"},"2146":{"dur":1,"text":"but having some\nassessment actually"},"2147":{"dur":3,"text":"is really important in\nthat sense, in the same way"},"2151":{"dur":2,"text":"that I prefer Northwestern's\nsystem of letting"},"2153":{"dur":2,"text":"us know the 25th and\n75th percentile more"},"2155":{"dur":3,"text":"than knowing what each colleague\nin my department makes."},"2159":{"dur":5,"text":"AUDIENCE: So you mentioned that\npraise from your

GALINSKY: Yeah, so\nthat's a great question."},"2173":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think that-- you\ncan just hold onto it."},"2180":{"dur":2,"text":"So we know that scarce\nthings are more valuable,"},"2183":{"dur":2,"text":"and we also know that things\nthat come from high power"},"2185":{"dur":1,"text":"people are more impactful."},"2187":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that there is one\nelement of that scarcity,"},"2189":{"dur":1,"text":"but I think that\nsome of the research"},"2191":{"dur":4,"text":"shows that even high power\npeople who praise frequently,"},"2195":{"dur":1,"text":"it still has this huge impact."},"2197":{"dur":3,"text":"It's especially impactful,\nthough, when high power people"},"2200":{"dur":4,"text":"praise in a descriptive rather\nthan sort of a general way."},"2205":{"dur":3,"text":"Like saying, what you\ndid today was fantastic,"},"2208":{"dur":3,"text":"is really great, rather like\noh, you're doing a great job."},"2211":{"dur":2,"text":"And so the more descriptive--\nfeedback in general,"},"2214":{"dur":2,"text":"the more descriptive it is,\nthe more valuable it is."},"2216":{"dur":2,"text":"And that amplification effect\ngets even more amplified then"},"2219":{"dur":1,"text":"in that case."},"2220":{"dur":1,"text":"That's a great\nquestion, because you"},"2221":{"dur":2,"text":"have these competing variables,\nscarcity and the high power"},"2224":{"dur":1,"text":"aspect."},"2226":{"dur":2,"text":"AUDIENCE: So given a\nchoice between cooperating"},"2228":{"dur":1,"text":"and competing, this\nsound very similar"},"2230":{"dur":2,"text":"to the classical\nprisoner's dilemma, where"},"2232":{"dur":3,"text":"lack of communication\nis leading to a person"},"2235":{"dur":2,"text":"having to decide whether to\ncompete versus cooperate."},"2238":{"dur":3,"text":"Do you guys have any\nidea of where or how"},"2241":{"dur":2,"text":"could be change a competition\ninto a cooperation?"},"2244":{"dur":1,"text":"How do we enable that at all?"},"2245":{"dur":1,"text":"MAURICE SCHWEITZER: Yeah."},"2246":{"dur":1,"text":"So there are a\ncouple of ideas here."},"2248":{"dur":2,"text":"One is, if we could think\nabout it structurally,"},"2251":{"dur":3,"text":"if we start cooperatively,\nwe signal our intentions,"},"2254":{"dur":1,"text":"that can get us off\non the right foot."},"2256":{"dur":1,"text":"And in a lot of\nour interactions,"},"2258":{"dur":2,"text":"we can do this by one on\none interactions with things"},"2260":{"dur":2,"text":"like non-task communication."},"2263":{"dur":2,"text":"So we don't get right\ndown to business."},"2265":{"dur":1,"text":"We chitchat first."},"2267":{"dur":3,"text":"We talk about sports, or the\nweather, or something else."},"2270":{"dur":3,"text":"Now more broadly, if we have\na really competitive person,"},"2274":{"dur":2,"text":"the best way to transform\na very competitive person"},"2277":{"dur":4,"text":"into a cooperative person\nis to put them on a team,"},"2281":{"dur":2,"text":"and have them compete\nwith some other team."},"2284":{"dur":3,"text":"Or we think of one\norganization, we're"},"2287":{"dur":2,"text":"competing with some\nother organization."},"2289":{"dur":3,"text":"And that can get somebody who's\nreally competitive, and now as"},"2293":{"dur":2,"text":"soon as they say, oh no, we're\ncompeting with somebody else,"},"2295":{"dur":2,"text":"now they're incredibly\nintensely cooperative."},"2298":{"dur":2,"text":"ADAM GALINSKY: And I think\nstructurally, the other thing"},"2300":{"dur":2,"text":"that you can do is we can change\nthe very nature of the game."},"2303":{"dur":1,"text":"So one of our\nfavorite studies-- I"},"2305":{"dur":2,"text":"know Maurice loves\nthis too-- is they"},"2307":{"dur":2,"text":"took the prisoner's dilemma,\ndidn't change any aspect of it."},"2310":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's the same typical point."},"2312":{"dur":2,"text":"There's this conflict between\ncooperation and competition,"},"2314":{"dur":2,"text":"but the incentives lean\ntowards competition."},"2317":{"dur":1,"text":"And they just told\npeople, we're going"},"2318":{"dur":1,"text":"to have you played game today."},"2320":{"dur":1,"text":"It's called the\nWall Street game."},"2321":{"dur":1,"text":"And then people\njust went straight"},"2323":{"dur":1,"text":"to the competitive decision."},"2324":{"dur":1,"text":"Or they said we're going\nto play game today."},"2326":{"dur":1,"text":"It's called the Community Game."},"2327":{"dur":2,"text":"And then people were much\nmore likely to choose"},"2330":{"dur":1,"text":"the cooperative\nchoice, even thought"},"2331":{"dur":1,"text":"the incentives hadn't changed."},"2333":{"dur":1,"text":"So some of the\nways that we can do"},"2334":{"dur":3,"text":"is we can create that external\nenemy, which is great."},"2338":{"dur":2,"text":"Other ways we can change\nthe nature of the task,"},"2340":{"dur":3,"text":"and how we describe it, as\nanother example of doing that."},"2343":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think as Marie\nsaid, one of the best ways"},"2346":{"dur":1,"text":"is path dependence."},"2348":{"dur":1,"text":"Start with cooperation."},"2349":{"dur":2,"text":"If you go back to\nAxelrod he came up"},"2352":{"dur":4,"text":"with the famous-- the thing that\nbeats all other prison dilemma"},"2356":{"dur":1,"text":"It's called Tit For Tat."},"2358":{"dur":0,"text":"How's that work?"},"2359":{"dur":1,"text":"You start by cooperating."},"2360":{"dur":2,"text":"You cooperate as long as\nthe other person cooperates."},"2363":{"dur":2,"text":"As soon as they defect\nfor the first time,"},"2365":{"dur":1,"text":"you switch to defection."},"2366":{"dur":2,"text":"You keep defecting until\nthey go back to cooperation,"},"2369":{"dur":1,"text":"and then you go\nback to

dilemma."},"2377":{"dur":3,"text":"So the most important\nthing is start corporation,"},"2380":{"dur":2,"text":"come with the right\nlabels, Community Game,"},"2382":{"dur":2,"text":"not Wall Street Game, and\ncome up with external threats"},"2385":{"dur":2,"text":"that you can come\nback together on."},"2388":{"dur":2,"text":"AUDIENCE: So I'm\nwondering about,"},"2390":{"dur":3,"text":"is there

briefly,"},"2802":{"dur":3,"text":"is team awards versus\nindividual awards."},"2805":{"dur":0,"text":"Right?"},"2806":{"dur":2,"text":"And the research shows, if you\njust have individual

different ranks,"},"2877":{"dur":2,"text":"and you have to follow orders."},"2879":{"dur":4,"text":"And for many tasks that just\nrequire people to do things"},"2884":{"dur":3,"text":"that they don't

nature of the task\nneeds to fit the hierarchy."},"2917":{"dur":1,"text":"ADAM GALINSKY: And\nnotice something"},"2918":{"dur":2,"text":"else about the Special\nForces is, they"},"2920":{"dur":1,"text":"tend to be smaller groups."},"2922":{"dur":0,"text":"Right?"},"2923":{"dur":2,"text":"As these groups get bigger,\nyou need a little bit more,"},"2925":{"dur":2,"text":"some type of\nmechanisms of control."},"2928":{"dur":2,"text":"But when you're going in,\nand you're a 20 person team,"},"2930":{"dur":2,"text":"it's a little bit

question."},"2938":{"dur":2,"text":"A few months, I read Adam\nGrant's book, \"Give and Take,\""},"2940":{"dur":2,"text":"which I assume you both\nare somewhat familiar

you switch back."},"2985":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think that's right."},"2986":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that the one\nthing that really, I"},"2989":{"dur":3,"text":"think, changes the very\nessence--

well."},"2996":{"dur":1,"text":"Wrote a blurb for the book."},"2998":{"dur":3,"text":"But I think, really, what our\nbook is fundamentally different"},"3001":{"dur":2,"text":"about this is this\nidea

competing too\nmuch consistently,"},"3038":{"dur":3,"text":"so maybe I'm killing joint\ngain and expanding the pie?"},"3041":{"dur":1,"text":"Or am I finding\nthe right

here?"},"3049":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think that reflection\nis really important."},"3051":{"dur":2,"text":"A lot of it's about this\nsort of self-understanding"},"3054":{"dur":3,"text":"of that
