today."},"675":{"dur":3,"text":"To do it, we had to\ndo some hacking."},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"I've got a cable connected to\nthis demo device, the specific"},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"device I'll be

fine."},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"[APPLAUSE]"},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"TIMOTHY JORDAN: So that was\na live Google search right"},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"there, and it gave me a\nresult on the
