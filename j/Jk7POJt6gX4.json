scrolls."},"63":{"dur":3,"text":"These are the scrolls that are talked about in this module,"},"67":{"dur":2,"text":"and so this walkthrough of the exhibition"},"69":{"dur":3,"text":"can serve us as an introduction to medieval scrolls"},"73":{"dur":2,"text":"and to the scrolls in this module."},"76":{"dur":4,"text":"Or it can serve as a summary of all the things"},"80":{"dur":4,"text":"that you

a collection of almost all of the scrolls"},"95":{"dur":2,"text":"that belong to Harvard University."},"98":{"dur":2,"text":"The good news about this whole thing is that it"},"100":{"dur":5,"text":"provides a wonderful representative sampling of the kinds of scrolls that"},"105":{"dur":2,"text":"survive to us from the Middle Ages."},"107":{"dur":5,"text":"You'll see some interesting things about scrolls in general in this exhibition."},"113":{"dur":2,"text":"For one thing, a display case of this size"},"115":{"dur":3,"text":"isn't the perfect way to display something that's 30 feet long."},"119":{"dur":3,"text":"So the majority of these scrolls have to be rolled up"},"122":{"dur":3,"text":"at the ends-- which, of course, is how the scrolls are mostly"},"125":{"dur":1,"text":"used when they're long."},"127":{"dur":2,"text":"Nevertheless, it makes it hard to examine the whole thing,"},"130":{"dur":3,"text":"so it's made an interesting choice for us."},"133":{"dur":2,"text":"We've had to pick what part of each scroll"},"135":{"dur":2,"text":"should be shown to the people who go through."},"138":{"dur":5,"text":"You lucky people have the opportunity to examine all the surfaces of all"},"143":{"dur":3,"text":"these scrolls, because they've all been very carefully digitized"},"147":{"dur":2,"text":"by the Harvard libraries."},"150":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a number of things that jump to the eye"},"152":{"dur":4,"text":"when you see these things in the flesh-- in the parchment, as it were."},"156":{"dur":3,"text":"One is that they vary enormously in size."},"160":{"dur":3,"text":"On a computer screen, everything's about the same size."},"163":{"dur":3,"text":"But look at this great big scroll here."},"166":{"dur":1,"text":"This is a Universal Chronicle."},"168":{"dur":5,"text":"This is the only one that has had to be displayed sideways, because it's"},"174":{"dur":2,"text":"wider than the display case itself."},"177":{"dur":2,"text":"But it's very handsome and very wide."},"179":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the biggest of the scrolls we have here."},"182":{"dur":7,"text":"And on the wall behind it is this tiny little poetical scroll"},"189":{"dur":3,"text":"that looks-- you can see to look at it, even in its frame--"},"193":{"dur":1,"text":"that it was once folded."},"194":{"dur":5,"text":"But it seems originally to have been a scroll and is a poetical dialogue."},"199":{"dur":3,"text":"So very large to very small, but there are other things"},"203":{"dur":4,"text":"that it's possible to notice too-- like qualities of parchment."},"208":{"dur":4,"text":"Look at this handsome, white parchment here."},"212":{"dur":3,"text":"And some of the others, you'll see much darker, very beat up."},"216":{"dur":4,"text":"We also go from scrolls that are quite simple-- this"},"220":{"dur":4,"text":"is a scroll in Greek with very little decoration-- to scrolls"},"225":{"dur":3,"text":"that are very highly decorated."},"229":{"dur":5,"text":"This is a genealogy of English kings that has almost more pictorial elements"},"234":{"dur":1,"text":"then text."},"235":{"dur":4,"text":"To this very beautifully decorated scroll"},"240":{"dur":2,"text":"of prayers with decoration around the top"},"242":{"dur":4,"text":"and the left-hand side, almost as though it were the left-hand page in a codex."},"247":{"dur":3,"text":"You kind of wonder why there's not decoration down the right hand margin,"},"251":{"dur":3,"text":"and I think it's because the decorator knows how you do a decoration."},"254":{"dur":2,"text":"You go on the outer margin and the top."},"256":{"dur":1,"text":"But nobody'll know for sure."},"258":{"dur":3,"text":"And then there's this scroll here-- this very sad scroll."},"261":{"dur":1,"text":"This is a chronicle."},"263":{"dur":4,"text":"And you can see that it once had very beautiful pictures which are now faded"},"268":{"dur":5,"text":"and that some great scholar, no doubt wanting to improve human knowledge,"},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"treated the text of this thing-- hoping that it"},"275":{"dur":1,"text":"would be possible to read it better."},"277":{"dur":3,"text":"And the result has been to make a hideous mass of the parchment"},"281":{"dur":3,"text":"and of what was once a very, very beautiful scroll."},"285":{"dur":6,"text":"So the variety of things that we see here and the difference in types"},"291":{"dur":4,"text":"of parchment, size of scroll, level of decoration, level of use"},"296":{"dur":2,"text":"and where-- all those things are something"},"298":{"dur":3,"text":"that you can only see when you're walking through this exhibition"},"302":{"dur":3,"text":"and looking, almost touching, these very beautiful objects."},"306":{"dur":6,"text":"In this module, we talk about four kinds of scroll-- not really kinds of scroll,"},"312":{"dur":4,"text":"but four reasons for making a scroll in the Middle Ages"},"317":{"dur":4,"text":"when the standard way of conveying a text was in a book, in a codex."},"322":{"dur":6,"text":"So I think we have in a way, examples of almost all of those kinds of scroll"},"328":{"dur":1,"text":"in this exhibition."},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"And looking at them in those categories will"},"331":{"dur":4,"text":"allow us either to introduce or to summarise the other, more detailed,"},"336":{"dur":1,"text":"units that we've had."},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"One reason for making a scroll is when you"},"340":{"dur":4,"text":"don't know how long the scroll is going to be until you're finished."},"344":{"dur":3,"text":"One that's a little bit like that is this scroll over here."},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"This scroll is a legal scroll, and in a way,"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"it might be thought of as the kind that could be"},"353":{"dur":4,"text":"extended as more information is needed."},"357":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact it's a copy of a treatise-- a treatise by a man"},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"named Glanvill about how to run a court, how"},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"to produce writs and various kinds of things."},"365":{"dur":2,"text":"And it is in the style of scroll that in England was"},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"called a chancery roll-- that is, one that's"},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"made, like all these other rolls, by making it"},"373":{"dur":3,"text":"longer by adding an additional piece of parchment to the bottom of it."},"376":{"dur":3,"text":"The distinction was made in England because other kinds of scrolls--"},"380":{"dur":3,"text":"and this group of scrolls here is sort of the other way of making rolls."},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"These are manor court rolls."},"386":{"dur":3,"text":"They are rolls that record the legal actions"},"389":{"dur":3,"text":"in the courts of English manors-- because the lord of the manor"},"392":{"dur":4,"text":"was officially a judge, and his judgment was recorded in rolls."},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"This kind of roll, called exchequer rolls,"},"399":{"dur":3,"text":"is made by stacking the parchment up on top of each other"},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"and binding it together across the top-- rather"},"405":{"dur":4,"text":"like a flipchart in a classroom-- and then rolling them up."},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"So big ones of these are sometimes called pipe rolls,"},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"because they looked sort of like a pipe."},"415":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's a very different kind of roll from any of the other rolls"},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"we'll see here of this particular kind of scroll."},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"So it could get longer as you like, but you do it"},"424":{"dur":3,"text":"by stacking the pages up rather than adding them to the bottom."},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"And so it's not really a roll."},"430":{"dur":4,"text":"It's really a codex-- except for the fact that they were stored rolled up."},"434":{"dur":5,"text":"So one kind of scroll is the kind whose length is not known."},"440":{"dur":3,"text":"Another reason for making a scroll is when you want it to be portable,"},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"when you want to carry it around from one place to another."},"447":{"dur":5,"text":"And this little scroll on the wall here is an example of that kind of thing."},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the smallest scroll at Harvard."},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"It may not be the smallest medieval scroll"},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"there is, because there were lots of other times"},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"when you wanted something very small."},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"You might want a life of Saint Margaret to wear around your neck."},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"You might want to have a little scroll of prayers"},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"that you carry with you as a kind of an amulet."},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"This one is actually a poetic dialogue."},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a fairly important text."},"475":{"dur":4,"text":"It's a dialogue between Ganymede and Helen about whether the love of man"},"480":{"dur":3,"text":"or the love of women is better."},"483":{"dur":5,"text":"And you can see along the sides, the different characters as they speak."},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a scroll that once was folded but probably was"},"491":{"dur":5,"text":"intended to be rolled and held in the hand while reciting."},"497":{"dur":4,"text":"We know that actors very often had a roll."},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"Actors still play roles, and the reason what actors do"},"504":{"dur":4,"text":"is called a role is because they held their part on a roll in their hand."},"509":{"dur":4,"text":"This is not exactly an actor's roll, but it's the kind of very small thing"},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"that poets are often depicted as holding in their hands"},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"and that we know actors did."},"518":{"dur":4,"text":"So the idea of having it be small so it can be portable."},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"There are other kinds of portable scrolls, not all of which"},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"are illustrated, in this exhibition."},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"Sometimes processional music for churches,"},"529":{"dur":3,"text":"you don't want to carry the whole, great big gradual around with you."},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"So you write the necessary stuff on a scroll"},"535":{"dur":3,"text":"to go carry around and bless the crops or bless"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"the different churches of the city."},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"Across the way here is another scroll that we might think"},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"of as being in the portable category."},"546":{"dur":7,"text":"It's a series of prayers that are designed"},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"to provide you time off from purgatory."},"556":{"dur":4,"text":"This is a very beautiful scroll, and you can imagine that if it were rolled up,"},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"it would be a little bit smaller than this."},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"So it might be a nice thing to carry around."},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"It might once also have been hung on the wall or down low for you"},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"to kneel down and pray."},"568":{"dur":3,"text":"But if you say all these prayers-- you see that they almost all begin with"},"572":{"dur":0,"text":"&quot;O.&quot;"},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"If you say all these prayers, you get x number"},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"of hundreds of years off in purgatory."},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"You can see this scroll in here."},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"It was discussed in one of the other units."},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"But it seems clear that it's small so that it"},"586":{"dur":4,"text":"can be carried around, because it's an object of personal devotion."}}
