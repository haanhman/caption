pain."},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"We take nerves that are noisy and active"},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"that should be quiet,"},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"and we put them to sleep with local anesthetics."},"379":{"dur":3,"text":"And most importantly, what we do"},"382":{"dur":4,"text":"is we use a rigorous, and often uncomfortable, process"},"386":{"dur":3,"text":"of physical therapy and occupational therapy"},"389":{"dur":3,"text":"to retrain the nerves in the nervous system"},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"to respond normally"},"395":{"dur":3,"text":"to the activities and sensory

problem,"},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"as we have now,"},"443":{"dur":3,"text":"but that will be disease-modifying drugs"},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"that will actually go right to the root of the

elaborate,"},"455":{"dur":3,"text":"that spill over and cause this central nervous system wind-up,"},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"or plasticity,"},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"that so is capable"},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"of distorting and amplifying"},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"the sensory experience that we call pain."},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"So I have hope"},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"that
