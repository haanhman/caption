project also used that same resource"},"29":{"dur":1,"text":"pool."},"30":{"dur":6,"text":"In this way, we\u2019ve truly got a common sharing\nof resources throughout the

situation."},"43":{"dur":5,"text":"Let\u2019s begin by supposing that I\u2019m the\nproject manager for the overall project and"},"49":{"dur":4,"text":"what I want to do now is to simply open the\nmaster project."},"54":{"dur":5,"text":"Now when I try to open the master project,\nI immediately come across one of the key points"},"60":{"dur":4,"text":"that\u2019s necessary to understand when it comes\nto sharing resources."},"64":{"dur":8,"text":"So if I click on File and then from the Open,\nI click on NFF Master; I see a message."},"72":{"dur":5,"text":"Now you can already see the master project\nthere, the Gantt Chart View in the background"},"78":{"dur":8,"text":"but what happens is that Project 2013 realizes\nthat this particular project is using a resource"},"86":{"dur":3,"text":"pool and it gives me two choices."},"90":{"dur":7,"text":"Now one choice, as you can see from the selected\nradio button there, is Open resource pool"},"97":{"dur":4,"text":"to see assignments across all sharer files."},"102":{"dur":6,"text":"Now if I\u2019m interested in looking at resourcing\nand in particular if I may want to look at"},"108":{"dur":5,"text":"resource leveling or resource overallocation,\nin order to really see what\u2019s going on it\u2019s"},"113":{"dur":3,"text":"going to be necessary for me to open the

pool?"},"142":{"dur":4,"text":"That other project manager may be using those\nresources and making assignments in those"},"147":{"dur":1,"text":"resources as well."},"149":{"dur":4,"text":"So what it\u2019s really saying to me here is\nif you want to be able to look at resource"},"154":{"dur":5,"text":"assignments and know how your resource assignments\nare looking, you need to open the pool itself"},"159":{"dur":6,"text":"so that you can see assignments across all\nof the projects that are sharing that resource"},"165":{"dur":1,"text":"pool."},"166":{"dur":5,"text":"Now as you\u2019ll see, when I come to open this\nproject and the resource pool in a little"},"172":{"dur":4,"text":"while, it will actually be opened in Read\nOnly mode so I won\u2019t be able to make changes"},"176":{"dur":1,"text":"to the resource pool as such."},"178":{"dur":2,"text":"We\u2019re going to look at that a little bit\nlater on."},"180":{"dur":3,"text":"But it does enable me to see assignments."},"184":{"dur":3,"text":"Now the second option says \u201cDo not open\nother files.\u201d"},"187":{"dur":3,"text":"So in this case, I\u2019m not going to be able\nto see the assignments."},"190":{"dur":2,"text":"So in what sort of situation might I choose\nthat option?"},"193":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, clearly I\u2019m not going to choose that\nwhen I\u2019ve got resource assignments to make"},"197":{"dur":4,"text":"or change because I won\u2019t be able to check\nthe availability of resources even."},"202":{"dur":5,"text":"But I might choose it in situations such as\none where what I really want to do is to add"},"208":{"dur":5,"text":"a load of tasks to a project and I\u2019m not\ndoing resource assignments at the moment."},"214":{"dur":4,"text":"I\u2019m just basically entering the task, maybe\neven importing them from another source."},"218":{"dur":3,"text":"I\u2019m going to deal with resources later on."},"221":{"dur":5,"text":"Now in that situation, it would actually be\na bad idea to tie up the resource pool unnecessarily."},"227":{"dur":3,"text":"So then I might choose the \u201cDo not open\nother files option.\u201d"},"231":{"dur":4,"text":"Another situation in which I might choose\n\u201cDo not open other files\u201d would be if"},"235":{"dur":5,"text":"I were say running off a report, maybe a report\nthat doesn\u2019t really involve resourcing."},"241":{"dur":5,"text":"Possibly just some sort of cost summary or\nmaybe a report on costs against budget over"},"246":{"dur":5,"text":"a period of time where I don\u2019t specifically\nneed to the resource pool and I only need"},"251":{"dur":3,"text":"to look at specific aspects of costs."},"254":{"dur":5,"text":"So there are some situations where I wouldn\u2019t\nneed to open the resource pool and that\u2019s"},"259":{"dur":2,"text":"really what that other option is there for."},"261":{"dur":3,"text":"Now on this occasion, I\u2019m going to stick\nwith that first option and see what everything"},"265":{"dur":5,"text":"looks like when I click on the OK button."},"270":{"dur":3,"text":"So the NFF Master project is now open."},"273":{"dur":4,"text":"If I go to the Window Group on the View Tab\nand click up here at the top right hand, obviously"},"278":{"dur":2,"text":"the resource pool project is open, click on\nthat."},"281":{"dur":4,"text":"It looks empty but of course I\u2019m looking\nat the tasks so let\u2019s go in and take a look"},"286":{"dur":1,"text":"at the resource sheet."},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"And, of course, we can see the resource sheet."},"290":{"dur":4,"text":"I\u2019ve left the project column in there so\nthat you can see that each of those resources"},"295":{"dur":3,"text":"is a resource within the NFF Resource Pool."},"298":{"dur":6,"text":"And if I click on the Resource Usage View,\neven though I don\u2019t have the individual"},"305":{"dur":5,"text":"projects open, I can see where each of the\nresources is used and this is particularly"},"311":{"dur":5,"text":"useful if you\u2019re dealing with a very large\nproject with perhaps with many subprojects."},"316":{"dur":4,"text":"If you were to just pull over here within\nthe Resource Usage View and click on Add New"},"321":{"dur":7,"text":"Column, go down and select Project, and you\ncan actually see which of the projects each"},"328":{"dur":2,"text":"of these resource assignments relates to."},"331":{"dur":1,"text":"So that can be pretty useful."},"332":{"dur":4,"text":"It can save you the trouble of fishing around\nto find out where a particular assignment"},"337":{"dur":2,"text":"has been made."},"339":{"dur":4,"text":"So let\u2019s just flip back to the main project\nagain, back to NFF Master."},"344":{"dur":6,"text":"The three subprojects are just shown as subproject,\nindividual rows on the Gantt Chart here."},"350":{"dur":3,"text":"Watch what happens if I expand NFF Requirements."},"353":{"dur":4,"text":"Let\u2019s just now get the project in view."},"358":{"dur":3,"text":"Now let me expand NFF

project."},"367":{"dur":4,"text":"But it also enables me again to just focus\nin on the particular part that I\u2019m interested"},"372":{"dur":1,"text":"in."},"373":{"dur":1,"text":"So here I am the

stage?"},"379":{"dur":5,"text":"Let\u2019s suppose I decide here that I really\nneed to give Toby a bit of work on the tendering"},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"process."},"385":{"dur":5,"text":"So select,

see that Toby has been assigned"},"410":{"dur":3,"text":"and you can see that that assignment is in\nthe NFF Master."},"414":{"dur":3,"text":"So let\u2019s now just switch back to the main\nproject and let\u2019s say, okay I\u2019ve finished"},"417":{"dur":1,"text":"working on that now."},"419":{"dur":4,"text":"Let me just close the main project and it\nsays \u201cDo you want to save changes to NFF"},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"Master?\u201d"},"425":{"dur":5,"text":"And then even though I haven\u2019t consciously\nmade any changes to NFF Requirements, I\u2019m"},"430":{"dur":5,"text":"asked if I want to save changes to that and\nto the other one and to the other one."},"436":{"dur":5,"text":"And then finally it says \u201cDo you want to\nupdate the resource pool to reflect changes"},"441":{"dur":3,"text":"for all open sharer projects?"},"444":{"dur":4,"text":"When updating the pool file Project will save\nthe resource pool that is memory."},"449":{"dur":6,"text":"This copy reflects the changes for all the\nsharer projects that you have open in memory.\u201d"},"455":{"dur":3,"text":"Now if I want to save the changes to the resource\npool and bear in mind that I\u2019ve actually"},"459":{"dur":7,"text":"made an assignment there that wasn\u2019t there\nbefore, click on OK, and even though it has"},"466":{"dur":6,"text":"been open in Read Only mode what now happens\nis that change is saved."},"472":{"dur":5,"text":"So in that scenario the project manager for\nthe overall project opened the overall project"},"478":{"dur":4,"text":"and the resource pool, had available the information\nin the resource pool and was able to therefore"},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"make an assignment."},"484":{"dur":5,"text":"And Project 2013 realized an assignment had\nbeen made, realized that the resourcing of"},"490":{"dur":4,"text":"the project was changing, and even though\nthe resource pool had been opened read-only,"},"494":{"dur":6,"text":"I was still able to make that change because\nit basically said \u201cDo you want to save this"},"500":{"dur":4,"text":"change in the resource pool even though you\u2019ve\nonly got it open Read Only?\u201d"},"504":{"dur":4,"text":"So that\u2019s a perfectly effective and valid\nway of going about things."},"509":{"dur":4,"text":"Now let\u2019s look at a different scenario and\none that happens quite a bit."},"513":{"dur":5,"text":"Let\u2019s suppose I\u2019m the manager on the testing\nproject and I want to make one or two changes"},"519":{"dur":5,"text":"to my project, so I decide

project."},"528":{"dur":9,"text":"So I open the testing project and it comes\nup with a question, \u201cDo I want to open the"},"538":{"dur":1,"text":"resource pool?\u201d"},"539":{"dur":1,"text":"And then I go, \u201cAh, hang on a minute."},"540":{"dur":1,"text":"I haven\u2019t got the resource pool."},"541":{"dur":4,"text":"I forgot to bring that with me and in fact\nI\u2019m really not supposed to take the resource"},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"pool away from work because everybody else\nuses it."},"548":{"dur":4,"text":"I\u2019ll just say Do not open other files and\nI can do what I need to do without the resource"},"553":{"dur":1,"text":"pool.\u201d"},"554":{"dur":4,"text":"Now when I click on OK, and bear in mind that\nI haven\u2019t now got the resource pool

going to do is I\u2019m going to assign\none of the other people to one of my tasks."},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"So let me just go back into the Gantt."},"578":{"dur":4,"text":"I want to assign one of those other people\nto the test script task."},"583":{"dur":7,"text":"So right click, Assign Resources, oh hang\non, I can only see Northern Farm Foods and"},"590":{"dur":1,"text":"Toby Arnott."},"591":{"dur":1,"text":"Why is that?"},"592":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, the reason that I can only see Northern\nFarm Foods and Toby Arnott is that I haven\u2019t"},"596":{"dur":7,"text":"got a copy of the resource pool and the only\nresources that my project is aware of are"},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"the ones that I\u2019ve used before."},"607":{"dur":5,"text":"So if I just scroll through the existing tasks\nof this project, of course, they\u2019re the"},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"two that I\u2019ve used before."},"613":{"dur":5,"text":"So it\u2019s aware of those two resources but\nit doesn\u2019t have the full resource pool."},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"So I could even assign Toby now at the moment."},"622":{"dur":1,"text":"In fact, why don\u2019t I do that?"},"623":{"dur":7,"text":"Why don\u2019t I assign Toby as say a 10% on\nthis and click on Assign."},"631":{"dur":5,"text":"I can even assign Toby but I can\u2019t assign\nany of the other resources because I don\u2019t"},"636":{"dur":3,"text":"have a copy of the resource pool."},"639":{"dur":7,"text":"So now let me close, make change to testing,\nmy project is closed."},"647":{"dur":4,"text":"But, of course, the resource pool is unaware\nof the change I\u2019ve just made."},"651":{"dur":7,"text":"Okay, so I get back to work the next day and\nI copy the MPP file from my laptop back on"},"658":{"dur":5,"text":"to the network or the shared location that\nwe\u2019re using and I\u2019m going to once again"},"664":{"dur":2,"text":"open testing."},"666":{"dur":5,"text":"This time when I open testing, I\u2019m going\nto open the resource pool as well, click on"},"671":{"dur":9,"text":"OK, and now of course within the testing project\nitself, I\u2019ve got that Toby Arnott assignment."},"680":{"dur":3,"text":"Let\u2019s switch into the resource pool."},"684":{"dur":3,"text":"Let\u2019s look at resources in the resource\npool."},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"Let\u2019s look at resource usage."},"690":{"dur":8,"text":"Let\u2019s look at Toby Arnott and he has been\nupdated automatically because as soon as I"},"698":{"dur":6,"text":"open the file with the resource pool open\nas well then the resource pool is updated"},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"with that assignment."},"705":{"dur":3,"text":"Now let me just quickly flick back to the\ntesting project again."},"709":{"dur":1,"text":"Now let me do the same thing."},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"Let\u2019s put somebody else on the scripting\nthis time."},"714":{"dur":1,"text":"Let\u2019s say Assign Resources again."},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"This time, of course, I get a full list."},"718":{"dur":4,"text":"Let me say that Lorraine here is going to\nbe very much involved in the testing."},"723":{"dur":3,"text":"So I\u2019m going to put Lorraine there as a\n50% resource."},"727":{"dur":3,"text":"I\u2019m going to assign her."},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"Click on Close."},"732":{"dur":11,"text":"Then I\u2019m going to close and I\u2019m going\nto say yes to changing anything and everything."},"744":{"dur":4,"text":"Now let\u2019s suppose that I\u2019ve taken this\nproject home again and I\u2019ve still not got"},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"my resource pool with me."},"750":{"dur":5,"text":"Open the testing project; say

I\u2019m going to see."},"765":{"dur":4,"text":"Yes, of course, now it\u2019s aware of three\nresources, the three resources that have been"},"769":{"dur":3,"text":"used and only those three."},"772":{"dur":4,"text":"So that\u2019s pretty much how it works when\nyou\u2019re one of the project managers who is"},"776":{"dur":2,"text":"using the shared resource pool."},"779":{"dur":4,"text":"Now the problem you have and this is a problem\nthat there isn\u2019t one universal solution"},"783":{"dur":7,"text":"to, is how do you manage to have several people\nworking on different subprojects and all having"},"791":{"dur":2,"text":"the same resource pool open at the same time?"},"793":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, one way of doing this is to use a truly\nshared location."},"799":{"dur":4,"text":"So whether you\u2019re using SkyDrive, whether\nyou\u2019re using some sort of SharePoint based"},"803":{"dur":6,"text":"or Project Server solution, really the only\nsatisfactory way is to have the resource pool"},"810":{"dur":1,"text":"truly shared."},"811":{"dur":3,"text":"But within the context of what we\u2019re doing\nhere, what I\u2019m trying to do is to make you"},"815":{"dur":5,"text":"aware of the issues that you\u2019re going to\nget if you don\u2019t have a completely shared"},"821":{"dur":4,"text":"resource pool in the sense
