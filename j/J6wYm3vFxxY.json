that you see prototyped"},"3159":{"dur":3,"text":"in academia, is because\nGoogle just has more data,"},"3162":{"dur":2,"text":"and they have more people,\nand they have more resources,"},"3165":{"dur":1,"text":"and they have more\nof everything, right?"},"3167":{"dur":0,"text":"And infrastructure."},"3168":{"dur":5,"text":"And so if have\nthis awesome

idea to\ngive it credibility"},"3181":{"dur":3,"text":"so that then I can make it into\nsomething huge, or sell it?"},"3185":{"dur":3,"text":"Or is it more practical\nto try to pitch it"},"3189":{"dur":1,"text":"to a company earlier?"},"3190":{"dur":3,"text":"But then how do you\nbuild credibility"},"3194":{"dur":2,"text":"around the idea instead of\nhaving somebody just toss it"},"3196":{"dur":1,"text":"on the back burner?"},"3198":{"dur":3,"text":"So I guess going on\nyour own versus working"},"3201":{"dur":1,"text":"with a big company."},"3202":{"dur":0,"text":"DORIE CLARK: Yeah."},"3203":{"dur":1,"text":"Really important."},"3204":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's actually a\ncouple of questions at play."},"3206":{"dur":2,"text":"One is the personal\nbranding

other\nis the question of,"},"3219":{"dur":4,"text":"where is the best home\nfor that idea in terms"},"3223":{"dur":2,"text":"of operationalizing\nit, and actually making"},"3226":{"dur":3,"text":"sure that it has the resources\nnecessary to be successful."},"3232":{"dur":4,"text":"In the Silicon Valley ecosystem,\nacqui-hires are a big thing"},"3236":{"dur":4,"text":"now, where companies,\nas you guys well know,"},"3241":{"dur":3,"text":"large companies will\nsnap up a smaller company"},"3244":{"dur":1,"text":"because they want the\ndevelopment talent."},"3246":{"dur":2,"text":"And they will shutter the\nprojects with impunity,"},"3249":{"dur":3,"text":"and say, OK, fellas, now\nyou're working on this."},"3252":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's a real thing."},"3255":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think that in a\ntechnical sense, about what"},"3258":{"dur":3,"text":"is necessary for the\nsuccess of an idea,"},"3262":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that it's important\nto keep in mind a few things."},"3264":{"dur":4,"text":"Number one, is it feasible\nto do the idea on your

to be done within the\nconfines of a larger system."},"3294":{"dur":4,"text":"If you do decide to\npartner with a company,"},"3298":{"dur":1,"text":"then it's a question\nof making sure"},"3299":{"dur":2,"text":"that you have contracts\nand legal protections,"},"3302":{"dur":4,"text":"as much as you possibly can,\nthat validate this idea is not"},"3306":{"dur":3,"text":"going to

going to be a risk\nthat someone might steal it?"},"3373":{"dur":0,"text":"Maybe."},"3374":{"dur":4,"text":"But I will tell you the very\nbest insurance against it"},"3378":{"dur":3,"text":"is for you
