Now I'm"},"404":{"dur":6,"text":"going to add a bit of the milk and work that\nin as well just to loosen the mixture because"},"410":{"dur":6,"text":"it's gone pretty stiff.

And"},"492":{"dur":5,"text":"I have to admit, at this point I'm in completely\nuncharted territory - I've never done anything"},"497":{"dur":7,"text":"like this before.

And a good old rolling\npin."},"546":{"dur":6,"text":"So we need to start off kneading the fondant\nto get it soft. And if it's really too hard"},"552":{"dur":5,"text":"to work with you can microwave it for about\n10 seconds to soften it. So I've added some"},"558":{"dur":7,"text":"food colouring goop.

And here's a"},"566":{"dur":4,"text":"tip I've just made up, it gets very sticky,\nso I reckon keeping a bowl of water handy"},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"would be a good idea."},"572":{"dur":10,"text":"So, as I suspected, this teeny tube of colouring\ngel, which cost \u00a31 by the way, has had almost"},"583":{"dur":6,"text":"no impact on the icing, so I'm going to use\na little bit of blue colouring powder, and"},"589":{"dur":5,"text":"some red. These industrial-strength things\nprobably cost a pound as well - much better"},"595":{"dur":5,"text":"value! Just dissolve that in a little bit\nof water, and then we'll add that to the fondant."},"602":{"dur":8,"text":"And mix that in, that's more like it.

I'm going to stick that"},"618":{"dur":5,"text":"in a plastic bag because I think that probably\nneeds to rest, and even if it doesn't, I do."},"624":{"dur":5,"text":"Right, I've rolled out the fondant, and it's\njust a bit bigger than my bit of string all"},"629":{"dur":6,"text":"the way round.

So now"},"636":{"dur":6,"text":"the next bit, the next challenge is to get\nit on the cake [ MOAN, GROAN ] Oh no, it's tearing."},"642":{"dur":9,"text":"I'm going to try rolling it out onto a bit\nof greaseproof paper. OK, here's the cake,"},"652":{"dur":6,"text":"so just tip him on."},"664":{"dur":5,"text":"OK, that was exciting,\nso I guess I lost a bit there. I'll see if"},"671":{"dur":6,"text":"I can stick it. And I didn't get it centred,\nso I've got quite a bit of excess down here"},"677":{"dur":7,"text":"- this tin is my measure, by the way.

And now I think that needs"},"713":{"dur":6,"text":"to rest for a few hours, so I'll stick it\nin a plastic bag and pop it in, well, a cool"},"719":{"dur":1,"text":"place, not the fridge, apparently."},"721":{"dur":4,"text":"Right, so here's the slightly weird-looking\ncake from yesterday. Now I'm going to do a"},"726":{"dur":5,"text":"band of black coloured marzipan around the\nbottom. I've got some black food colouring,"},"732":{"dur":5,"text":"but that's not obviously going to be anything\nlike enough.

Again."},"764":{"dur":6,"text":"So I'm just going to measure the diameter\nof the cake with a bit of string, and the"},"770":{"dur":6,"text":"height - which will be the width of the strip\nI'm going to roll - is, 4 centimetres, that's"},"777":{"dur":6,"text":"an inch and a half. So we want a load of cornflour\nto stop it sticking, and we just roll away."},"783":{"dur":8,"text":"You can hardly see this against the black\nworktop, but that's a strip of marzipan, and"},"792":{"dur":5,"text":"it needs to be quite thick, it's got to be\nthicker than the actual icing on the cake."},"798":{"dur":6,"text":"And I've got some cold water, I'm just going\nto moisten the marzipan, which will make it"},"804":{"dur":5,"text":"stick, I hope.

I'm just going to try and wash off the cornflour."},"816":{"dur":6,"text":"So, this isn't turning out to be the perfectly\naccurate representation of the crown that"},"822":{"dur":5,"text":"I was hoping for, so we're going for a cartoon\ncrown look instead, and we'll try not to obsess"},"828":{"dur":5,"text":"about little details. Because also I need\nto get this done in the next few days, and"},"834":{"dur":1,"text":"there's a lot to do."},"836":{"dur":6,"text":"I've got these silver balls, they're actually,\nyou know cake decorations sometimes they're really teeth-breakers,"},"842":{"dur":5,"text":"but these are cute, they're like puffed wheat\nor something.
