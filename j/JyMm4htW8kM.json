think that our customers would tell you that we have some"},"60":{"dur":3,"text":"of the coolest product that you can't find anywhere else."},"63":{"dur":5,"text":"But, I think, they would also say that we are more than cool product."},"68":{"dur":4,"text":"We've really built a name for ourselves in putting our"},"73":{"dur":2,"text":"community at the center of everything that we do,"},"76":{"dur":3,"text":"which is pretty innovative for a fashion retailer."},"79":{"dur":3,"text":"Like traditionally, fashion is very tops down, it's sort of like -"},"83":{"dur":3,"text":"We tell you what's cool, and then you buy it and you wear it,"},"86":{"dur":1,"text":"and then we tell you what's cool."},"88":{"dur":0,"text":"You know, next week,"},"89":{"dur":2,"text":"and then you

changes"},"99":{"dur":2,"text":"that have happened in the last 10 to 15 years."},"102":{"dur":2,"text":"Very tops down, very hierarchical,"},"104":{"dur":1,"text":"and we've sort of flipped that

you,"},"132":{"dur":2,"text":"and you know like, in demographics and psychographics like,"},"134":{"dur":5,"text":"she is in her 20s and 30s like, our age range is kind of 18 to 35,"},"140":{"dur":2,"text":"but it goes below that and it goes above as well."},"142":{"dur":2,"text":"The average age of our customer is 27."},"145":{"dur":4,"text":"But I think that a picture is worth a thousand words, right?"},"149":{"dur":2,"text":"So, like this is her, this is our community,"},"151":{"dur":2,"text":"like this is kind of the best way to get a sense"},"154":{"dur":3,"text":"of what our brand is and what ModCloth is."},"158":{"dur":4,"text":"To give you a sense of our scale quickly today,"},"162":{"dur":3,"text":"we now have a team of over

this list here."},"185":{"dur":2,"text":"And our buying office in Los Angeles,"},"188":{"dur":2,"text":"and our in-house design team is there as well."},"191":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I spend a lot of time with our team in LA,"},"193":{"dur":3,"text":"developing and designing the products and picking the products"},"196":{"dur":2,"text":"from the market that we sell to our customers."},"201":{"dur":2,"text":"Another way to get a sense of our scale like these"},"203":{"dur":2,"text":"are some of our followers on social networks,"},"206":{"dur":3,"text":"like, we're one of the highest followed retailers on Pinterest."},"210":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that probably makes a lot of sense when you"},"212":{"dur":2,"text":"think about our community that I showed you like,"},"215":{"dur":1,"text":"it's a pretty good fit there."},"217":{"dur":4,"text":"Other than these numbers,"},"221":{"dur":4,"text":"right, like I'd say we shipped close to 2 million orders last year,"},"226":{"dur":3,"text":"like it's definitely come a long way from,"},"229":{"dur":3,"text":"you know when I started at 17 in my parent's living room."},"235":{"dur":6,"text":"And I won't spend a ton of time on this but I wanted to just kind of"},"241":{"dur":5,"text":"run through our founding story and like how ModCloth came to be."},"247":{"dur":4,"text":"You know, honestly like I don't know that I was a born entrepreneur."},"251":{"dur":3,"text":"Like I wasn't that girl that was like selling lemonade,"},"255":{"dur":1,"text":"you know as soon as I could,"},"256":{"dur":2,"text":"and like trying to employ my friends like,"},"259":{"dur":1,"text":"make an extra buck."},"261":{"dur":2,"text":"But I am absolutely an entrepreneur through and through."},"263":{"dur":3,"text":"That's one thing that I would like love to share with you guys like,"},"267":{"dur":1,"text":"if you could take something away from this,"},"268":{"dur":3,"text":"like there is no right way to be an entrepreneur."},"272":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, as I have gone through this journey and"},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"as I have had the incredible opportunity to meet"},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"so many other amazing entrepreneurs like,"},"279":{"dur":2,"text":"yes there are those born entrepreneurs who,"},"281":{"dur":1,"text":"when you hear their stories you're like,"},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"oh my god like, basically as soon as you could talk,"},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"you are trying to sell something and to start a business."},"288":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's amazing and I really respect that"},"290":{"dur":2,"text":"but you can come to entrepreneurism,"},"293":{"dur":4,"text":"you can find your entrepreneurial path in many different ways."},"297":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think that I am a proof of that."},"300":{"dur":4,"text":"So, for me it starts with my passion for fashion and"},"304":{"dur":3,"text":"just loving clothes and I am not ashamed to admit it."},"308":{"dur":4,"text":"It might sound unintellectual but I've always liked"},"312":{"dur":1,"text":"getting dressed and it's always something that"},"314":{"dur":1,"text":"I was drawn to and I was passionate about,"},"316":{"dur":1,"text":"and I had an eye for."},"318":{"dur":4,"text":"I didn't have a ton of disposable income growing up,"},"323":{"dur":3,"text":"so I started shopping at thrift stores and vintage stores like,"},"326":{"dur":2,"text":"basically I wanted to be able to stand out,"},"329":{"dur":1,"text":"and I wanted to be able to buy things"},"330":{"dur":1,"text":"that other people wouldn't have."},"332":{"dur":3,"text":"And, you know, the intersection of these two things like,"},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"a little bit of disposal income and wanting to stand"},"337":{"dur":3,"text":"out let me to vintage and thrift store shopping."},"341":{"dur":4,"text":"I grew up in South Florida, a suburb near Fort Lauderdale."},"346":{"dur":4,"text":"And you know, I was a Florida girl."},"350":{"dur":5,"text":"Like, I had seen snow once and when I was in high school like,"},"356":{"dur":3,"text":"I worked really hard I wanted to not be a Florida girl anymore,"},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"I got into Carnegie Mellon and decided to be a Business major because"},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"you know honestly I didn't really know exactly what I wanted to do,"},"365":{"dur":3,"text":"but I figured it like business maybe could lead the fashion,"},"368":{"dur":3,"text":"I actually didn't really know what job existed in the fashion industry"},"372":{"dur":3,"text":"other than this concept of being a fashion designer and I wasn't sure"},"375":{"dur":3,"text":"that I had the artistic skills to be a fashion designer."},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I got into Carnegie Mellon,"},"382":{"dur":4,"text":"I had to move up to Pittsburgh and experienced my first winter ever,"},"386":{"dur":4,"text":"which is kind of daunting maybe you guys had an opposite experience,"},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"coming to beautiful sunny Stanford,"},"394":{"dur":2,"text":"from a place that was cold and snowy."},"396":{"dur":1,"text":"But you know, for me,"},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"like I couldn't, I had to buy a whole new wardrobe"},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"and I couldn't do that in South Florida."},"403":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, even if I had the disposable income to be"},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"able to go to mall and buy everything brand new,"},"409":{"dur":3,"text":"there isn't winter wear or even like autumn wear"},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"in the malls in South Florida in the summer time."},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, I started going to thrift stores and"},"418":{"dur":1,"text":"looking for winter wear for the first time."},"420":{"dur":3,"text":"And I found a lot of amazing stuff and like,"},"423":{"dur":4,"text":"I think that was kind of the moment when I sort of started to"},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"become an entrepreneur like that like seed started to grow."},"430":{"dur":1,"text":"Like I was just like,"},"432":{"dur":2,"text":"I can't pass up these beautiful pieces of clothing,"},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"I know they're worth so much more than they,"},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"you know are kind of marked at just sitting here like,"},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"maybe this was like my innate merchant coming out."},"443":{"dur":3,"text":"And I found myself buying stuff even if it didn't fit me,"},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"and I would kind of say like,"},"448":{"dur":3,"text":"oh like I will give it to a friend or I will use the"},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"buttons for a craft project which would never happen"},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"or I learn it sew and I will tailor it to fit me,"},"457":{"dur":1,"text":"which also has not happened,"},"459":{"dur":1,"text":"I still don't know how to sew."},"461":{"dur":5,"text":"That's okay, but I was bringing all the stuff home like,"},"466":{"dur":1,"text":"trash bags, trash bags full of it,"},"468":{"dur":4,"text":"and I started dating this guy around the same time."},"473":{"dur":4,"text":"He was - his name is Eric, he is my husband today;"},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"he is my Co-Founder at ModCloth."},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"And he had actually started a web hosting business"},"483":{"dur":3,"text":"with two of his friends in high school."},"486":{"dur":3,"text":"I would say he is more of that born entrepreneur like,"},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"thinking about running a business from you know,"},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"aged four or whatever like as soon as he could talk"},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"and kind of think about what he wanted to do."},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"So, he and this web hosting business,"},"499":{"dur":1,"text":"he built a few e-commerce sites like,"},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"think about it this is like 2000\/2001, it was sort of like,"},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"where these like young smart kids like,"},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"let's help you get on the inner webs like,"},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"he would go around to local business centers in"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"South Florida area and kind of pitch them on like"},"515":{"dur":2,"text":"we'll help you get - you need a website to like,"},"518":{"dur":1,"text":"make your small business bigger."},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, he had some experience and he was actually"},"523":{"dur":3,"text":"the one that suggested that I build a website and"},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"sell some of these products that I was finding."},"528":{"dur":3,"text":"It was like one of a kind - these one-of-a-kind vintage pieces."},"533":{"dur":3,"text":"And I thought that it sounded like a fun challenge,"},"536":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, quite honestly I also thought hey if I sell some of the stuff"},"539":{"dur":4,"text":"that means that I get to buy more stuff which sounds really cool."},"544":{"dur":4,"text":"And, it's, you know, again like thinking back to that time, right?"},"549":{"dur":3,"text":"Like, there weren't really any other options like,"},"552":{"dur":3,"text":"eBay was an option but I wasn't really finding designer goods and"},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"they didn't really think I could like build a brand on eBay,"},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"it seems like, if I was going to do it I wanted to"},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"be able to control the - and more of the customer experience"},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"and more of the shopping experience."},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"And you know, there wasn't Etsy,"},"569":{"dur":4,"text":"there wasn't any of these like easy to start up shopping carts,"},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"there was no Instagram to sell on."},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"Like, when I think about the entrepreneurs"},"576":{"dur":1,"text":"are starting today it's like,"},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"all you really need is a mobile phone and an Instagram"},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"account and you can be connected to,"},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"you know, you can be a tastemaker to a group of people that"},"585":{"dur":4,"text":"kind of look up to you and think that you have good taste."},"590":{"dur":1,"text":"It was different, which is kind of crazy."},"591":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean I still consider myself like very young and I am still"},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"like learning and kind of exploring the world but then when"},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"I think back to when I started my business like,"},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"there was no iPhone, there was no Facebook like,"},"603":{"dur":3,"text":"it's hard to imagine."},"607":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, I was gifted a digital camera"},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"for my high school graduation gift, it was my first digital camera,"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"it was like kind of like a brick and I used that digital"},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"camera and I used all these kind of leftovers that I was"},"619":{"dur":4,"text":"finding when I was thrifting to launch the website."},"624":{"dur":4,"text":"I also taught myself Photoshop, I taught myself some Web Design,"},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"I think I was using like Microsoft FrontPage."},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"It's like something kind of embarrassing."},"635":{"dur":4,"text":"And my boyfriend helped me like, hack an open source shopping cart,"},"640":{"dur":3,"text":"we used interchange which was like Linux shopping cart if"},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"anyone ever sold that footing around back in the day."},"647":{"dur":4,"text":"And I spent that summer, before I moved up to Pittsburgh,"},"651":{"dur":4,"text":"kind of like we incorporated and I bought the first set"},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"of inventory and merchandised that inventory like,"},"658":{"dur":3,"text":"I read all description, I thought of the names, I designed the site,"},"661":{"dur":0,"text":"I thought about like,"},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"some of the user experience of the site you know,"},"665":{"dur":3,"text":"as much as we could kind of change from this open source platform."},"669":{"dur":5,"text":"And, we launched in January of 2003 and we"},"674":{"dur":3,"text":"actually had a sale on our very first day,"},"677":{"dur":1,"text":"it was not someone I was related to,"},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"or someone that I knew which was very exciting,"},"682":{"dur":1,"text":"it kind of felt magic."},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"And, I think like that was sort of like,"},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"going into the thrift stores and seeing those products"},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"and seeing opportunity was the seed like,"},"691":{"dur":1,"text":"that was like the moment when I like,"},"693":{"dur":1,"text":"I feel like I became an entrepreneur like,"},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"I was just like, wow this is really cool like,"},"696":{"dur":4,"text":"I can go out and find this stuff and I can like do all these things"},"701":{"dur":3,"text":"that I really like to do and like people will pay me for it."},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"Like that's pretty awesome, and if I could like,"},"707":{"dur":3,"text":"I was like just getting started in my college"},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"career and I was just thinking about,"},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"you know, the things what I wanted to be as an adult,"},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"the things I want to study and the things I want to do."},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"And I kind of have this like inkling of like,"},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"wow if I could do my own thing, like that would be pretty special,"},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"that would be pretty amazing."},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I ran the business part-time while I was at school,"},"728":{"dur":4,"text":"I continued to sell one-of-a-kind vintage and you know it grew,"},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"it was like kind of fits and starts."},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, like some months it was really slow,"},"737":{"dur":1,"text":"we'd only have a handful of orders."},"739":{"dur":3,"text":"I was doing whatever I could I ended up being a double major."},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"I doubled major in Business and in German."},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I had like a pretty rigorous course load as well."},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"But like on spring break, winter break, summers like,"},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"whenever I could, whenever I wasn't like doing"},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"other stuff the normal college kids do,"},"756":{"dur":1,"text":"like I just kept coming back to this,"},"757":{"dur":1,"text":"like I loved it and I was getting better"},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"at it and that was a really good feeling."},"762":{"dur":4,"text":"And so when I was approaching graduation in 2006,"},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"I knew kind of my junior,"},"770":{"dur":3,"text":"my senior year, I really started thinking about"},"773":{"dur":4,"text":"ModCloth as a legitimate career option."},"778":{"dur":3,"text":"And, it was a scary decision to have to make."},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"And one of the things that I intuitively did that I would"},"784":{"dur":1,"text":"recommend to all of you guys and it's like - and something"},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"that's has been really powerful in my life is like,"},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"when you are making big decisions like this and"},"791":{"dur":1,"text":"maybe it's obvious and you guys already do this,"},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"but if you are making big decisions like,"},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"sit down and really think about like what are the"},"797":{"dur":4,"text":"worst-case scenarios and write them down and like,"},"802":{"dur":1,"text":"get them out there and you know,"},"803":{"dur":1,"text":"you wouldn't get them a 100% right."},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"But like, get comfortable with those and then,"},"808":{"dur":3,"text":"you know, then you can go ahead and make your decision."},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"That's always helped me and this was definitely"},"814":{"dur":1,"text":"what I was doing at this time in my life."},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, I was thinking about like well, if this doesn't work like,"},"819":{"dur":2,"text":"I am going to be behind my peers like,"},"821":{"dur":3,"text":"I haven't gotten, you know I was kind of making these decisions"},"824":{"dur":1,"text":"of like do I spent the summer working on the business?"},"826":{"dur":1,"text":"Or do I try to get an internship?"},"828":{"dur":2,"text":"Like where I do I devote my time and"},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"that's like the eternal question for,"},"833":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, everyone but particularly for entrepreneurs"},"835":{"dur":1,"text":"where do I devote my time?"},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"That question will never go away."},"839":{"dur":4,"text":"But you know, I really, I sat down I said okay like,"},"843":{"dur":1,"text":"if I don't get a job like,"},"845":{"dur":2,"text":"maybe people will look at me and say like wow,"},"848":{"dur":1,"text":"like what was she doing,"},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"she didn't get the job right out of college like,"},"851":{"dur":1,"text":"it's all these things maybe I wouldn't"},"852":{"dur":1,"text":"be able to pay my student loans,"},"854":{"dur":2,"text":"worst-case scenario like maybe I will go bankrupt."},"857":{"dur":3,"text":"I am young, I don't have a family, that's okay, you know,"},"861":{"dur":3,"text":"like I like, put that all out there and really thought about it."},"864":{"dur":2,"text":"And you know, it's scary but at least,"},"867":{"dur":2,"text":"like you know what you're scared of versus"},"869":{"dur":3,"text":"just like being afraid of like the unknown."},"873":{"dur":3,"text":"So, in 2005\/2006, you know,"},"876":{"dur":2,"text":"I spent a lot of time thinking about the business model like,"},"879":{"dur":4,"text":"I knew if I wanted to, I knew that we had a lot of traffic,"},"883":{"dur":3,"text":"I knew that like, new things that were happening"},"887":{"dur":2,"text":"on the web like Facebook you know,"},"890":{"dur":1,"text":"like a, a student at the time so I want"},"891":{"dur":1,"text":"the just first people to use it."},"893":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, I saw the power of not just building an online retailer"},"897":{"dur":4,"text":"but really building a community and allowing like,"},"902":{"dur":2,"text":"I realized the part of why customers were drawn"},"904":{"dur":2,"text":"to ModCloth was not just the fashion but it was"},"906":{"dur":3,"text":"because they were similarly-minded individuals,"},"910":{"dur":1,"text":"similarly-minded women."},"911":{"dur":2,"text":"And I saw this opportunity to build a community,"},"914":{"dur":1,"text":"to build a lifestyle,"},"915":{"dur":3,"text":"to build something that was more than just about fashion,"},"918":{"dur":3,"text":"and that spoke to customers and that empowered"},"922":{"dur":2,"text":"them to be actually part of the process, right?"},"924":{"dur":3,"text":"Like, Facebook isn't fun if your friends aren't on it,"},"928":{"dur":1,"text":"in the same way like,"},"929":{"dur":2,"text":"I thought that I could build the retailer that"},"931":{"dur":2,"text":"would actually allow you to meet new people,"},"934":{"dur":2,"text":"and meet new like-minded people get style inspiration,"},"937":{"dur":3,"text":"get style advice from not just like a fashion"},"940":{"dur":3,"text":"company but from other individuals."},"944":{"dur":3,"text":"There is also the rise of personal bloggers"},"947":{"dur":2,"text":"and celebrity bloggers and kind of like,"},"949":{"dur":1,"text":"everyone was gaining an audience."},"951":{"dur":3,"text":"And I saw this opportunity to build by brands"},"954":{"dur":4,"text":"and to gain an audience from ModCloth."},"959":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, I was thinking a lot about the business model,"},"962":{"dur":2,"text":"I was thinking about all the stuff that was happening at the"},"964":{"dur":4,"text":"time and I saw the opportunity to you know not - I knew that"},"969":{"dur":3,"text":"I had to move away from one-of-a-kind vintage pieces like,"},"972":{"dur":5,"text":"it's not scalable, it's not a great customer experience either,"},"978":{"dur":3,"text":"you know everything is like in one color and in one size."},"982":{"dur":4,"text":"But I really had no idea where to start,"},"986":{"dur":3,"text":"like I wasn't a fashion person, I was based in Pittsburg,"},"990":{"dur":1,"text":"Pennsylvania and not necessarily the"},"992":{"dur":2,"text":"most fashionable city in the world."},"994":{"dur":2,"text":"Carnegie Mellon which isn't a really a school that has you know,"},"997":{"dur":2,"text":"I was starting to meet entrepreneurial mentors but,"},"1000":{"dur":2,"text":"I didn't really have anyone in my life that"},"1002":{"dur":2,"text":"had retail experience at that time."},"1005":{"dur":7,"text":"But I was eventually able to find independent designers and to"},"1012":{"dur":3,"text":"really make the business start to look like what it looks like"},"1015":{"dur":4,"text":"today which is you know this mix of products that you know,"},"1019":{"dur":3,"text":"some of them have a direct vintage inspiration but really like"},"1023":{"dur":3,"text":"old fashion is vintage inspired in some way or another because"},"1026":{"dur":2,"text":"you know it's like whether it's a dress from the 1940s,"},"1029":{"dur":2,"text":"but then was re-interpreted in the 1980s,"},"1031":{"dur":1,"text":"then is re-interpreter today,"},"1032":{"dur":3,"text":"it's just you know, hemlines are longer or

inspired in some way."},"1044":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I was able to kind of take this,"},"1049":{"dur":4,"text":"this business that started in my parents living"},"1054":{"dur":2,"text":"room and eventually moved into - this is,"},"1056":{"dur":4,"text":"this photo here in 2006 was our first like,"},"1060":{"dur":2,"text":"official fulfillment centre."},"1063":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'm looking at today like we're in a 200,000"},"1066":{"dur":2,"text":"square foot fulfillment center in Pittsburgh."},"1068":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, like I said we're shipping two million orders last year."},"1073":{"dur":2,"text":"You know it's - we've come a long way."},"1075":{"dur":3,"text":"But another lesson that I've learned as an entrepreneur"},"1079":{"dur":6,"text":"is that you know part of that drive will - like that,"},"1085":{"dur":2,"text":"that really drives you to start things,"},"1088":{"dur":3,"text":"will never let you be satisfied."},"1092":{"dur":3,"text":"So, it's really important as an entrepreneur I think to like"},"1095":{"dur":3,"text":"work - to work on the practice of like celebrating your wins"},"1098":{"dur":2,"text":"and like taking a moment to step back and saying like,"},"1100":{"dur":1,"text":"wow, we have actually come a long way,"},"1102":{"dur":1,"text":"because I look at this and I'm like,"},"1104":{"dur":2,"text":"okay we've come a long way but we still have,"},"1106":{"dur":2,"text":"I still have such a high aspirations for the brand,"},"1109":{"dur":2,"text":"I have such high aspirations for the business,"},"1111":{"dur":2,"text":"we still have such a long way to go."},"1113":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's been like an important learning for me."},"1115":{"dur":2,"text":"It's like, how do you, how do you make it sustainable,"},"1118":{"dur":3,"text":"how do you like celebrate these wins but still keep"},"1121":{"dur":2,"text":"that drive to want to get bigger and better."},"1124":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I'm still excited to get bigger and better,"},"1127":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm still learning tons of lessons along the way."},"1131":{"dur":3,"text":"And one of the biggest ones that I have learned"},"1134":{"dur":5,"text":"thus far is that it's okay to be,"},"1140":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm kind of calling it like it's okay to be a rookie,"},"1143":{"dur":3,"text":"like it's okay to kind of not know what you're doing,"},"1147":{"dur":6,"text":"it's okay to come at problems from a really kind of"},"1153":{"dur":2,"text":"like rookie mentality and that can actually be,"},"1156":{"dur":3,"text":"it's not just okay but it can really be an advantage."},"1159":{"dur":1,"text":"and I think that you know,"},"1161":{"dur":2,"text":"as I look back at my career and like my story at ModCloth,"},"1164":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that it absolutely was,"},"1165":{"dur":2,"text":"and advantage for us in a lot of ways."},"1168":{"dur":5,"text":"Like I said, like we weren't retail veterans like"},"1173":{"dur":1,"text":"we didn't come from retail families like,"},"1175":{"dur":3,"text":"this is a photo of me with our first delivery"},"1179":{"dur":2,"text":"of non-vintage merchandise like,"},"1182":{"dur":1,"text":"peeking over those boxes like oh my god,"},"1184":{"dur":2,"text":"what I am going to do with all these boxes next."},"1186":{"dur":2,"text":"It's like literally you can kind of"},"1188":{"dur":2,"text":"tell literally in our college house."},"1190":{"dur":4,"text":"And, you know, like when I was going through this process"},"1195":{"dur":3,"text":"like back in it's like really formative time like 2005\/2006"},"1198":{"dur":3,"text":"and thinking about making this a real business like,"},"1202":{"dur":4,"text":"I really had to google like, where do I find wholesale clothing like,"},"1206":{"dur":3,"text":"I didn't know where to go and who to ask."},"1211":{"dur":4,"text":"And, you know, it eventually like all my goggling eventually led me"},"1215":{"dur":3,"text":"to like some of the major fashion trade shows and I kind of like,"},"1219":{"dur":2,"text":"bought a ticket to Las Vegas and went to these trade shows"},"1222":{"dur":2,"text":"and like walked in without knowing what to expect."},"1225":{"dur":2,"text":"And you know, like I thought maybe it's"},"1227":{"dur":1,"text":"going to be it's like glamorous thing,"},"1229":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean you hear about the fashion trade shows,"},"1230":{"dur":2,"text":"it sounds like maybe it's going to be kind of cool."},"1233":{"dur":2,"text":"In reality, this is what it actually looks like,"},"1235":{"dur":1,"text":"you are in the Las Vegas Convention Center,"},"1237":{"dur":1,"text":"you are walking through you know it's"},"1238":{"dur":2,"text":"kind of concrete there is no windows,"},"1240":{"dur":5,"text":"so this was what I walked into with this kind of rookie mentality."},"1246":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think the fact that I did just go in and"},"1250":{"dur":2,"text":"like asked a ton of questions and was like,"},"1252":{"dur":2,"text":"you know like I literally asked about everything."},"1254":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, I probably honestly was like asking some dumb questions."},"1258":{"dur":2,"text":"Like I was like, if I buy this,"},"1260":{"dur":2,"text":"how many do I have to buy and when will you ship it to me and"},"1262":{"dur":2,"text":"when will I pay you and like some of these things that,"},"1265":{"dur":3,"text":"you know, usually you know about the time you get to this level."},"1269":{"dur":1,"text":"And you know what I learned about the trade"},"1270":{"dur":2,"text":"shows like really quickly, right?"},"1273":{"dur":1,"text":"It's like the buyers go there,"},"1275":{"dur":3,"text":"they walk the floor like everyone from small retailers like,"},"1278":{"dur":2,"text":"ModCloth was at the time to like the big department stores."},"1281":{"dur":2,"text":"They walk the floor, they looked at the designers;"},"1284":{"dur":2,"text":"the designers all bring samples that they"},"1286":{"dur":2,"text":"are hoping to put into production."},"1288":{"dur":3,"text":"They see how many buyers are interested in the samples and then"},"1291":{"dur":2,"text":"they go back and they make some bets and they say okay this is,"},"1294":{"dur":1,"text":"you know, we have some pre orders for these and like"},"1296":{"dur":1,"text":"these things people are kind of interested in."},"1298":{"dur":2,"text":"So, this is where we're going to kind of place"},"1300":{"dur":2,"text":"our bets and like place our production orders."},"1303":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, what I realized really quickly in 2006\/2007 as I was"},"1308":{"dur":2,"text":"starting to like build out our designer portfolio and moved"},"1310":{"dur":3,"text":"away from this one-of-a-kind-vintage model was that,"},"1314":{"dur":3,"text":"a lot of the items that I really loved weren't getting made."},"1317":{"dur":2,"text":"And so what I'd hear from the designers is just like,"},"1319":{"dur":3,"text":"oh but Nordstrom bought this one, don't you want this one,"},"1322":{"dur":0,"text":"this one will get made."},"1323":{"dur":3,"text":"And of course, I didn't want the item that Nordstrom bought"},"1326":{"dur":2,"text":"even if it was a great seller for Nordstrom because I needed"},"1329":{"dur":2,"text":"differentiated cool products for my customer."},"1332":{"dur":3,"text":"So, you know, I kind of like I asked some rookie questions like,"},"1336":{"dur":2,"text":"I was like hold on, you guys have all of these samples"},"1339":{"dur":4,"text":"here and you're showing them to us and like,"},"1344":{"dur":2,"text":"just because I am the only one that likes them like,"},"1346":{"dur":2,"text":"sometimes half of the items that we are finding"},"1349":{"dur":1,"text":"at these trade shows weren't getting made,"},"1350":{"dur":2,"text":"like we had a really big fallout rate."},"1353":{"dur":2,"text":"So, yeah, I asked some of these questions,"},"1356":{"dur":1,"text":"you know, they said we have all these samples here like,"},"1358":{"dur":2,"text":"I have all these customers that I can talk to"},"1360":{"dur":2,"text":"like immediately I don't have to you know,"},"1363":{"dur":3,"text":"wait six months and then walk out on to a sales floor like,"},"1367":{"dur":2,"text":"the traditional brick-and-mortar guys do,"},"1369":{"dur":2,"text":"why can't, if you have these samples here,"},"1372":{"dur":3,"text":"you've already gone through the cost of making the sample,"},"1375":{"dur":1,"text":"can I just take those samples and see,"},"1377":{"dur":1,"text":"maybe my customers will really love it,"},"1379":{"dur":1,"text":"maybe I can help you get to that."},"1381":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, usually depending on the item it's like a 100,"},"1385":{"dur":2,"text":"600 minimum production order."},"1388":{"dur":2,"text":"So, maybe I can help you get to that,"},"1390":{"dur":4,"text":"so I can like guarantee my order and I can"},"1394":{"dur":1,"text":"give you some real customer feedback."},"1397":{"dur":4,"text":"This led to our be-the-buyer program which we launched in 2009;"},"1401":{"dur":3,"text":"this is kind of like a quick snapshot of the concept."},"1405":{"dur":4,"text":"But it really came from this like, rookie mentality of like why not,"},"1409":{"dur":1,"text":"why can't we do this?"},"1411":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think like, some people in the fashion"},"1415":{"dur":2,"text":"industry kind of have this reaction of like,"},"1418":{"dur":2,"text":"but that's your job as a buyer like,"},"1420":{"dur":1,"text":"that's the thing that you are suppose to do is,"},"1422":{"dur":3,"text":"you are suppose to go out there and like kind of you know,"},"1425":{"dur":3,"text":"make your educated guess of what the customer will like."},"1428":{"dur":1,"text":"But from my perspective I was like,"},"1430":{"dur":1,"text":"if I don't have to take that risk."},"1432":{"dur":2,"text":"And I can actually engage my customers and"},"1434":{"dur":2,"text":"let them - let her be part of the process,"},"1437":{"dur":2,"text":"like wouldn't that be much better for everyone."},"1440":{"dur":3,"text":"For independent designers as well like this was giving"},"1443":{"dur":2,"text":"them direct customer feedback rather than just getting,"},"1446":{"dur":2,"text":"traditionally they just heard from the buyers whether,"},"1449":{"dur":1,"text":"why the buyers like something or not."},"1451":{"dur":3,"text":"So, giving them like actual feedback from customers"},"1454":{"dur":2,"text":"was a really innovative thing at the time."},"1457":{"dur":5,"text":"And, this was a really important part of our growth like we were"},"1463":{"dur":4,"text":"able to for one like get more items that they actually needed"},"1467":{"dur":3,"text":"like I said half of the items were falling out at the time."},"1471":{"dur":2,"text":"And this was like the core of,"},"1474":{"dur":4,"text":"you know, this like launched the core of our core tenet"},"1478":{"dur":3,"text":"at our company that we should really be empowering"},"1482":{"dur":1,"text":"the community to help us make these decisions,"},"1484":{"dur":3,"text":"even these decisions that traditionally are made"},"1488":{"dur":3,"text":"internally at traditional fashion retailers."},"1494":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that it's important,"},"1497":{"dur":3,"text":"so I am telling this whole story like I think it's"},"1500":{"dur":4,"text":"also important as entrepreneurs to keep in mind that"},"1505":{"dur":4,"text":"fake it till you make it is totally valid like,"},"1509":{"dur":4,"text":"that concept but it is just one of many tools in"},"1514":{"dur":2,"text":"their toolbox and that's something I've found as"},"1516":{"dur":1,"text":"I've looked back in my career and you know,"},"1517":{"dur":3,"text":"as I think that what I would share with my younger self."},"1522":{"dur":6,"text":"I think that often we try to like,"},"1528":{"dur":1,"text":"just fake it till we make it all the time."},"1530":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think, part of it is kind of the culture like,"},"1532":{"dur":2,"text":"it's especially in the entrepreneurial world like,"},"1535":{"dur":3,"text":"you're just, you're always you know, you're just like yes,"},"1539":{"dur":1,"text":"of course I can do this,"},"1540":{"dur":1,"text":"of course we'll be able to hit these numbers."},"1542":{"dur":2,"text":"Of course, we will be able to - you know we know what"},"1544":{"dur":2,"text":"our plans are going to be one year from now,"},"1546":{"dur":1,"text":"two years from now, five years from now."},"1549":{"dur":2,"text":"And, you know, that's totally fine,"},"1551":{"dur":1,"text":"and like sometimes you really do have to do that"},"1553":{"dur":2,"text":"like when you are pitching your business,"},"1555":{"dur":1,"text":"when you are talking to investors like,"},"1557":{"dur":1,"text":"absolutely fake it till you make it."},"1559":{"dur":1,"text":"But I think that sometimes like,"},"1561":{"dur":2,"text":"if you get too caught up in this mentality like,"},"1563":{"dur":4,"text":"you can, I would caution you to resist like,"},"1568":{"dur":4,"text":"faking it, because you might miss opportunities to actually"},"1572":{"dur":2,"text":"find your own path and you might miss these opportunities"},"1575":{"dur":1,"text":"to kind of put your hand up and say like,"},"1577":{"dur":3,"text":"why are we are doing it this way, why is it happening this way,"},"1581":{"dur":2,"text":"does this actually make sense?"},"1584":{"dur":5,"text":"And this has been a really valuable lesson for me."},"1590":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, one last word on being a rookie."},"1594":{"dur":3,"text":"I will tell everyone out here you know,"},"1598":{"dur":2,"text":"don't be afraid to go into an industry"},"1601":{"dur":1,"text":"that you don't know anything about."},"1603":{"dur":2,"text":"I will say like, look at this girl,"},"1606":{"dur":5,"text":"if she can go on to be the creative lead of a well-loved"},"1611":{"dur":2,"text":"multi-million dollar fashion brand like,"},"1614":{"dur":5,"text":"you can do it too, even you know, if you're not raised in it,"},"1620":{"dur":3,"text":"it's not like in your blood or whatever,"},"1623":{"dur":3,"text":"I think that I am living proof that if your passion about something"},"1627":{"dur":5,"text":"like you can create your own kind of your own place in that world."},"1632":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay, so this leads very well to my next lesson"},"1637":{"dur":4,"text":"which is that it's okay to look back and cringe."},"1641":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm definitely putting those pictures up,"},"1644":{"dur":1,"text":"makes me cringe a little bit,"},"1645":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm not going to lie."},"1648":{"dur":2,"text":"I think this has been a really important"},"1650":{"dur":2,"text":"lesson for me as a creative entrepreneur."},"1653":{"dur":4,"text":"I think especially as you started out in your career,"},"1657":{"dur":3,"text":"it can be really scary to be vulnerable"},"1661":{"dur":1,"text":"and to put your work out in the world."},"1662":{"dur":2,"text":"You want everything to be a 100% perfect"},"1664":{"dur":1,"text":"and I don't think this is just,"},"1666":{"dur":2,"text":"you know, when I say creative I mean like,"},"1668":{"dur":3,"text":"I am definitely, I spent a lot of my job and all of my times"},"1671":{"dur":1,"text":"thinking about statics and thinking about you know,"},"1673":{"dur":3,"text":"design and these sorts of things but I think this is just as"},"1676":{"dur":2,"text":"applicable to if you are a code or whatever you're are doing,"},"1679":{"dur":3,"text":"whatever type of product you're building like,"},"1683":{"dur":1,"text":"when you are starting out in your career,"},"1685":{"dur":2,"text":"you're are not going to be good and you"},"1687":{"dur":1,"text":"are hopefully going to get better,"},"1688":{"dur":2,"text":"which means that you're going to look back and your taste are"},"1690":{"dur":2,"text":"going to be better and you're are going to know so much more,"},"1693":{"dur":2,"text":"and you're cringe on your earlier work."},"1695":{"dur":3,"text":"So, you have to just like get out there and do stuff."},"1699":{"dur":3,"text":"This is one of my favorite quotes by the author Neil Gaiman,"},"1703":{"dur":2,"text":"like if you're making mistakes means"},"1705":{"dur":2,"text":"you're out there doing something."},"1707":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think, it can be hard sometimes, right?"},"1710":{"dur":1,"text":"Like you want to just like,"},"1713":{"dur":3,"text":"you want to wait until it's absolutely perfect and I'm not advocating"},"1716":{"dur":4,"text":"by any means that you should not care very much about what you do and"},"1721":{"dur":7,"text":"not have like real attention to detail but I think that this like,"},"1728":{"dur":2,"text":"having this permission of like no matter what,"},"1730":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to get better and I'm going to"},"1732":{"dur":1,"text":"look back and cringe on my earlier work."},"1734":{"dur":1,"text":"I think it's really freeing."},"1736":{"dur":1,"text":"So, it's something that,"},"1737":{"dur":3,"text":"you know, it's one of those lessons that's like easy to listen"},"1741":{"dur":2,"text":"to and maybe to understand intellectually and it's harder"},"1743":{"dur":3,"text":"to actually put to work in your life as entrepreneur,"},"1747":{"dur":3,"text":"it's something I am still trying to work on and it can be tough"},"1751":{"dur":3,"text":"quite honestly to find that balance of like having that attention"},"1755":{"dur":3,"text":"to detail and not wanting to release anything until it's perfect"},"1758":{"dur":3,"text":"and just getting in out there and like knowing that it's going"},"1762":{"dur":2,"text":"to change and you're going to move on and you're going to look"},"1764":{"dur":2,"text":"back and you're going to cringe one way or the other."},"1767":{"dur":2,"text":"So, let's just take a moment,"},"1769":{"dur":3,"text":"I will show you my look back and cringe"},"1772":{"dur":3,"text":"This is the first version of ModCloth."},"1775":{"dur":1,"text":"This is our first logo."},"1777":{"dur":2,"text":"I think it's very clearly designed by a 17"},"1780":{"dur":2,"text":"year old who has just learned Photoshop."},"1783":{"dur":5,"text":"Yeah, but this doesn't mean that like I was really"},"1788":{"dur":2,"text":"proud of this thing when we released it."},"1791":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, I spent time on it, I was thoughtful and you know,"},"1794":{"dur":2,"text":"I thought that this like embodied my brand and"},"1797":{"dur":2,"text":"I thought that bevel looked really cool."},"1799":{"dur":3,"text":"But I look back on it now and its cringe worthy."},"1803":{"dur":4,"text":"This is the next version of the site,"},"1807":{"dur":3,"text":"this was 2005\/2006 we switched to a new,"},"1811":{"dur":3,"text":"another like open source like Linux based shopping cart."},"1815":{"dur":2,"text":"But again it was like I had taken a few design classes,"},"1818":{"dur":3,"text":"it's like starting to get a little better but like this is"},"1822":{"dur":2,"text":"some of the content that we are producing around that time."},"1824":{"dur":5,"text":"I look back at it and like, oh my God, oh it's horrible,"},"1830":{"dur":1,"text":"but if I hadn't done it,"},"1832":{"dur":3,"text":"if I hadn't put it out there I wouldn't be where I am today."},"1836":{"dur":3,"text":"This is kind of circa 2007\/2008 starting to come"},"1839":{"dur":4,"text":"along and starting to see some of the like,"},"1844":{"dur":3,"text":"kind of more the hallmarks of the ModCloth brand that you see today,"},"1847":{"dur":2,"text":"for those of you that are familiar with the brand."},"1849":{"dur":2,"text":"And you are starting to see more of like,"},"1851":{"dur":3,"text":"our kind of playful quirkiest that had come through."},"1855":{"dur":2,"text":"But you know, again I look back at this and the work"},"1858":{"dur":4,"text":"that I do today and I am like, yikes, you know."},"1863":{"dur":3,"text":"And like I said, it is about having this,"},"1867":{"dur":2,"text":"you know, this is where we are at today and it's having"},"1869":{"dur":4,"text":"this permission to be okay with the fact that you know,"},"1873":{"dur":2,"text":"in 10 years you look back and like you will be proud of"},"1876":{"dur":2,"text":"what you did but hopefully you're going to better and you're"},"1878":{"dur":2,"text":"going to better and you're going to be past that stage in"},"1880":{"dur":2,"text":"your career and your life and you're going to be,"},"1882":{"dur":4,"text":"you know on to greater and better things."},"1888":{"dur":3,"text":"So, the way that we think about like this philosophy"},"1892":{"dur":3,"text":"and putting into practice today at ModCloth is,"},"1895":{"dur":5,"text":"you know, in one way like thinking about the concept and our product"},"1901":{"dur":4,"text":"development on the technology side of a minimum viable product,"},"1905":{"dur":2,"text":"and I am sure you guys are probably"},"1907":{"dur":1,"text":"familiar with this type of concept,"},"1909":{"dur":3,"text":"you know it's like, think about what's the minimum I need"},"1912":{"dur":3,"text":"to put this on to the world and get user feedback on it."},"1916":{"dur":2,"text":"So an example like, a more recent example"},"1919":{"dur":2,"text":"for us at ModCloth is our style gallery."},"1921":{"dur":2,"text":"This is a feature that we built and we launched on"},"1923":{"dur":4,"text":"our site in 2012 and like the goals are you know,"},"1927":{"dur":2,"text":"let our customer come and upload outfit photos and"},"1930":{"dur":2,"text":"like browses outfit photos and get inspired,"},"1933":{"dur":3,"text":"and loved them and kind of build you know the community in that way."},"1936":{"dur":3,"text":"And then the second goal is to make those outfit Photoshopable."},"1940":{"dur":2,"text":"And this was the first version that we rolled out,"},"1942":{"dur":3,"text":"we worked really hard on it, we felt really good about it,"},"1946":{"dur":3,"text":"but you know, since we got it out there to our users as we sold it,"},"1949":{"dur":2,"text":"she knew she realized that she should browse"},"1952":{"dur":2,"text":"and she got the inspiration part of it,"},"1954":{"dur":1,"text":"but she did not get the shopping part at all."},"1956":{"dur":4,"text":"You know we iterated like, released many new versions like,"},"1961":{"dur":2,"text":"lots of small iterations."},"1963":{"dur":3,"text":"We found that they just like adding this magnifying glass on the"},"1967":{"dur":3,"text":"mouse over told her that she could actually click in and shop."},"1970":{"dur":2,"text":"So, it's like these little things and you know,"},"1973":{"dur":4,"text":"even though the first version of our style gallery failed, right?"},"1978":{"dur":2,"text":"Like, we wanted it to do two things"},"1980":{"dur":1,"text":"and it only did one of those things."},"1982":{"dur":2,"text":"We didn't view it as a failure,"},"1985":{"dur":4,"text":"like we got something out there and we learned and you know,"},"1989":{"dur":6,"text":"if we had waited to like make it a 100% to like if weren't"},"1996":{"dur":2,"text":"diligent on really thinking about like what is that minimum"},"1998":{"dur":3,"text":"out viable product to get out there and to get feedback."},"2002":{"dur":3,"text":"We would have probably spend a lot of time like"},"2005":{"dur":2,"text":"running in a different direction because once you"},"2008":{"dur":2,"text":"actually get things in front of your community,"},"2010":{"dur":2,"text":"in front of your users like that's where you"},"2012":{"dur":3,"text":"get the feedback that actually matters."},"2015":{"dur":4,"text":"And, you know, I think for us and for our brands"},"2019":{"dur":2,"text":"like the fact that our customers were able to be"},"2022":{"dur":2,"text":"part of this experience of iterating like,"},"2025":{"dur":2,"text":"she tells us what she likes and what she doesn't and she actually"},"2027":{"dur":4,"text":"sees that we listen and that we make changes and that's really empowering"},"2032":{"dur":6,"text":"to our customers and that's like that empowerment is more than just"},"2039":{"dur":5,"text":"retail it's more than just transaction like that is part of the emotional"},"2044":{"dur":4,"text":"core of what has made ModCloth successful and I think what's made"},"2048":{"dur":3,"text":"Mod Cloth like loved by our community as a brand."},"2052":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's the - and the final thing that I really want to talk"},"2057":{"dur":4,"text":"about today is that the emotional core of what you do like,"},"2061":{"dur":3,"text":"the purpose of what you do as an entrepreneur is"},"2064":{"dur":3,"text":"really important and that's really what endures."},"2068":{"dur":6,"text":"I think, part of this is it's not just external,"},"2075":{"dur":3,"text":"it's not just that the emotional core of what"},"2078":{"dur":3,"text":"you do connects your customers to you,"},"2082":{"dur":3,"text":"but it's internal as well like your purpose"},"2085":{"dur":2,"text":"is what connects your team to the work,"},"2088":{"dur":3,"text":"it's what make you know, employees like an actual team,"},"2092":{"dur":2,"text":"an actual company and it's what makes"},"2094":{"dur":2,"text":"everyone move in the same direction."},"2097":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think that you know,"},"2099":{"dur":4,"text":"ModCloth like our purpose is really to find on understanding"},"2104":{"dur":4,"text":"our audience like we know that if you ask women the study"},"2108":{"dur":2,"text":"showed that 96% of women say that what,"},"2111":{"dur":3,"text":"they say that they agree with the statement that"},"2114":{"dur":1,"text":"what you wear affects how you feel, right?"},"2116":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's more than dresses like it's more than just a transaction"},"2121":{"dur":3,"text":"and like being able to connect to that I think has been like"},"2125":{"dur":3,"text":"externally and internally has been one of the most valuable"},"2128":{"dur":2,"text":"things that we have done as a company."},"2132":{"dur":3,"text":"So understanding, so it's important to understand your audience,"},"2136":{"dur":3,"text":"and I feel like there are like when I've"},"2140":{"dur":1,"text":"talked to other entrepreneurs about this,"},"2142":{"dur":3,"text":"you know, I hear like what if I am in a B2B business,"},"2146":{"dur":4,"text":"I am not dealing with an audience like yours that has this sort of,"},"2150":{"dur":6,"text":"you know, emotional need for product but it's not just about,"},"2156":{"dur":1,"text":"like I said, it's not just about external,"},"2158":{"dur":2,"text":"it's about internal as well, right?"},"2161":{"dur":6,"text":"And I think like we think about companies that really endure"},"2167":{"dur":4,"text":"and that people love and people love working at,"},"2172":{"dur":1,"text":"it's having a purpose,"},"2174":{"dur":2,"text":"that's more than just like we're going to grow"},"2176":{"dur":2,"text":"quickly and we're going to make money like,"},"2178":{"dur":4,"text":"you need to think about and I have not come across a business yet,"},"2183":{"dur":3,"text":"that doesn't have some sort of emotional core that"},"2186":{"dur":2,"text":"doesn't make people's lives better in some way that"},"2188":{"dur":3,"text":"doesn't serve some purpose even if you are B2B,"},"2192":{"dur":3,"text":"like, you're helping those other employees."},"2195":{"dur":2,"text":"The other employees of those other businesses,"},"2198":{"dur":2,"text":"be more efficient, to be better at their jobs like,"},"2201":{"dur":2,"text":"there is an emotional core there and I think"},"2203":{"dur":2,"text":"that getting to it is really important."},"2206":{"dur":2,"text":"This is ours at ModCloth;"},"2208":{"dur":4,"text":"we are committed to inspiring personal style and helping"},"2213":{"dur":3,"text":"our customers feel like the best versions of

saying you have to become this,"},"2235":{"dur":2,"text":"like, idealized like ModCloth version."},"2238":{"dur":1,"text":"We're just saying like we will help you"},"2239":{"dur":2,"text":"be the best version of who you are."},"2243":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is really powerful like,"},"2246":{"dur":5,"text":"this is what our customers see from the rest of the fashion industry."},"2251":{"dur":3,"text":"Like each of these images is actually taken"},"2254":{"dur":2,"text":"from a different retailers' campaign."},"2257":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, you see them next to each other"},"2259":{"dur":3,"text":"and they look pretty similar, I think."},"2263":{"dur":2,"text":"And there is nothing wrong with these images like,"},"2266":{"dur":3,"text":"they are beautiful and there is like,"},"2270":{"dur":2,"text":"lots of good things to say about them."},"2272":{"dur":3,"text":"But, for me like, I am a customer and I look"},"2276":{"dur":4,"text":"at them and I don't see myself here like,"},"2281":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't feel like, I necessarily belong."},"2284":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is an image from one of our most"},"2288":{"dur":2,"text":"recent song campaigns of ModCloth."},"2290":{"dur":2,"text":"It's actually, this campaign went viral,"},"2293":{"dur":4,"text":"it was written about around the world and we decided to photograph"},"2297":{"dur":2,"text":"our employees and one of our best selling swimsuits,"},"2300":{"dur":2,"text":"it's a swimsuit that we carry in a broad range of"},"2302":{"dur":2,"text":"sizes and that we would carry for years and years,"},"2305":{"dur":3,"text":"that has like thousands of reviews from customers of all age"},"2309":{"dur":3,"text":"ranges and shapes and sizes that say that they love it."},"2312":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is really powerful, I mean, like you look at this and like,"},"2316":{"dur":2,"text":"and I think this is the message in branding as well like,"},"2318":{"dur":1,"text":"if you are this is a message,"},"2320":{"dur":1,"text":"this is a lesson in branding as well, right?"},"2322":{"dur":1,"text":"Like, if you look at these images,"},"2324":{"dur":1,"text":"even though they are from different retailers,"},"2325":{"dur":1,"text":"they kind of blend together."},"2327":{"dur":1,"text":"This image is different, right?"},"2328":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's important that like,"},"2330":{"dur":4,"text":"your business esthetically kind of stands out as well."},"2334":{"dur":2,"text":"But emotionally it stands out too, right?"},"2337":{"dur":1,"text":"Like this is a different message;"},"2338":{"dur":3,"text":"this is saying women look different and that's okay,"},"2341":{"dur":3,"text":"it's something that can be celebrated and that we can be happy about."},"2345":{"dur":2,"text":"And, it's also - it's like,"},"2351":{"dur":4,"text":"this is the most vulnerable time for a women,"},"2356":{"dur":2,"text":"probably when she is wearing a swimsuit like that's"},"2358":{"dur":2,"text":"what we hear from a lot of our customers."},"2360":{"dur":1,"text":"And it is saying like,"},"2361":{"dur":3,"text":"hey you don't, it doesn't have to be that way, that's okay."},"2366":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I think this emotional - like I said like,"},"2369":{"dur":5,"text":"this is our emotional core for a business for all of you like,"},"2375":{"dur":2,"text":"whether you're starting businesses,"},"2377":{"dur":2,"text":"you're already an entrepreneur if you are you know,"},"2379":{"dur":2,"text":"just like you want to take these in entrepreneurial"},"2382":{"dur":1,"text":"mindset to a bigger company like,"},"2384":{"dur":2,"text":"think about the emotional core of what you do,"},"2386":{"dur":1,"text":"like it really is important."},"2389":{"dur":4,"text":"It's a lesson that I've learned all the time like,"},"2394":{"dur":4,"text":"we get this incredible emotional outpouring from our"},"2398":{"dur":4,"text":"customers because they see what we do for them,"},"2403":{"dur":1,"text":"how we speak to them."},"2404":{"dur":3,"text":"And, we see it on Facebook, we see it on Twitter,"},"2408":{"dur":3,"text":"we see it internally on our site and like for me"},"2411":{"dur":5,"text":"this is the thing that I am most proud of when"},"2416":{"dur":3,"text":"I talked about like what I felt at ModCloth."},"2420":{"dur":2,"text":"And you know, I think if you can find something"},"2422":{"dur":4,"text":"that you love to do that is financially viable,"},"2427":{"dur":2,"text":"right like, you got to get paid for it."},"2430":{"dur":3,"text":"And that also emotionally connects with other people that makes"},"2433":{"dur":4,"text":"other people's lives better in some way that is really powerful"},"2438":{"dur":3,"text":"and that's something that like worth getting out of bed for."},"2441":{"dur":4,"text":"And you know, as an entrepreneur like I think that you have to have,"},"2446":{"dur":1,"text":"I think in some ways like,"},"2448":{"dur":3,"text":"you have to have that drive because there is going to be some"},"2451":{"dur":2,"text":"days when you need something to get you out of bed like,"},"2454":{"dur":2,"text":"it wouldn't be easy."},"2456":{"dur":3,"text":"And this emotional core is also what"},"2460":{"dur":3,"text":"gets you through tough times, right?"},"2463":{"dur":3,"text":"And, I think that you know,"},"2469":{"dur":4,"text":"a lot of the times in the entrepreneurial world like we don't"},"2473":{"dur":3,"text":"talk about what it's actually like to go through tough times."},"2476":{"dur":3,"text":"You can feel like you hear a lot of the kind"},"2479":{"dur":2,"text":"of overnight success stories and like,"},"2482":{"dur":4,"text":"I have had that story written about me in various ways you know,"},"2486":{"dur":4,"text":"like I have been on a lot of those 25 under 25, and 30 under 30 less,"},"2491":{"dur":2,"text":"and you know, like, entrepreneur does this great thing"},"2494":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's like build this incredible business."},"2497":{"dur":4,"text":"And I'll say like, always from my perspective and like from the"},"2501":{"dur":2,"text":"other entrepreneurs that I have met and I have learned about,"},"2504":{"dur":4,"text":"that concept of like, an overnight success story just doesn't exist,"},"2508":{"dur":1,"text":"there is always something more to it,"},"2510":{"dur":4,"text":"and it's never just like flowers and rainbows."},"2515":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I feel like on the opposite end"},"2518":{"dur":1,"text":"of the spectrum like you do hear about,"},"2519":{"dur":3,"text":"I'll just pull one out of the sky like,"},"2523":{"dur":2,"text":"you hear about something like, pets.com"},"2525":{"dur":3,"text":"or it's like oh, crazy explosion\/implosion"},"2529":{"dur":2,"text":"however you want to describe it."},"2531":{"dur":3,"text":"We don't hear as much about the stuff in between like,"},"2534":{"dur":3,"text":"the actual like, what is it like to weather hard times."},"2538":{"dur":3,"text":"And, I have been through that like,"},"2541":{"dur":4,"text":"the last 12 months in ModCloth were not the easiest time"},"2546":{"dur":4,"text":"of my life and part of why I want to talk about is because"},"2550":{"dur":3,"text":"I do think that you don't hear other entrepreneurs talking"},"2554":{"dur":2,"text":"about very much and I do think it's like,"},"2557":{"dur":4,"text":"part of it is the kind of the culture in the"},"2562":{"dur":1,"text":"same way that I was talking about like,"},"2564":{"dur":2,"text":"we feel like we have to fake it till we make it,"},"2566":{"dur":2,"text":"that's a tool, and it's not something"},"2569":{"dur":1,"text":"that you have to do all the time."},"2570":{"dur":5,"text":"And I think that, yeah often like you know when you"},"2576":{"dur":4,"text":"are in the valley or wherever you're at like,"},"2581":{"dur":4,"text":"you - as entrepreneurs you start to equate like,"},"2585":{"dur":2,"text":"kind of your personal success and your personal worth"},"2588":{"dur":3,"text":"with your businesses' success and businesses worth."},"2591":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think that that is,"},"2594":{"dur":2,"text":"there is no way to kind of get around that"},"2596":{"dur":1,"text":"when you are starting out because,"},"2598":{"dur":3,"text":"it is just you and your - it's you in like a very small group of"},"2601":{"dur":2,"text":"people and you're putting so much or results into the business."},"2604":{"dur":2,"text":"But, as the business grows and as you I mean,"},"2607":{"dur":2,"text":"if you are goal is to actually add more people,"},"2610":{"dur":2,"text":"you know, it isn't just you anymore,"},"2612":{"dur":3,"text":"and I think that's like an important lesson that founders"},"2615":{"dur":2,"text":"have to learn is it's not just going to be you."},"2618":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's like, for the good times and the bad times like,"},"2623":{"dur":1,"text":"the good times it's your team."},"2625":{"dur":2,"text":"And the bad times, it's you and your"},"2627":{"dur":2,"text":"team as well and that can be again,"},"2630":{"dur":4,"text":"it's one of those lessons that I think is probably easier to understand"},"2634":{"dur":3,"text":"intellectually than to actually like put in practice in your life."},"2639":{"dur":4,"text":"And, you know, for me over the last 12 months at ModCloth like,"},"2644":{"dur":4,"text":"kind of the long story short and it's like we grew really quickly."},"2649":{"dur":3,"text":"We had to make some tough decisions in the"},"2652":{"dur":3,"text":"business because we were at a point, where we were growing quickly,"},"2656":{"dur":4,"text":"we weren't able to support our burn rate anymore,"},"2662":{"dur":8,"text":"and you know, this purpose was what got me through making those decisions"},"2670":{"dur":4,"text":"and like having those times where it's hard to get out of bed,"},"2674":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's hard to go to work."},"2676":{"dur":4,"text":"That's another thing that's hard to face as a founder when you know,"},"2680":{"dur":4,"text":"you've created your own job and you don't want to go do that job,"},"2685":{"dur":1,"text":"that's a tough place to be in."},"2686":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think if you don't have this purpose,"},"2689":{"dur":2,"text":"if you don't have something that's deeper"},"2691":{"dur":1,"text":"that's pulling you back to it,"},"2693":{"dur":2,"text":"it will be all but impossible."},"2696":{"dur":1,"text":"So, you know, for us like as I said,"},"2698":{"dur":3,"text":"like had to make some hard decisions like we had to"},"2701":{"dur":3,"text":"lay people off last year and it was the hardest thing"},"2704":{"dur":3,"text":"I have ever done professionally and you know,"},"2708":{"dur":3,"text":"quite honestly like I felt I spent a lot of last"},"2712":{"dur":4,"text":"year kind of personally feeling like a failure,"},"2716":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's tough place to be in."},"2719":{"dur":3,"text":"And, again like this purpose was that brought me back to,"},"2723":{"dur":2,"text":"okay even though I am feeling this way,"},"2726":{"dur":1,"text":"I can step outside I can look at this,"},"2728":{"dur":3,"text":"I can look at my business and I know that my business is a success"},"2731":{"dur":3,"text":"because my business has this purpose and my business has this."},"2735":{"dur":3,"text":"You know this thing that it's doing like this is real,"},"2739":{"dur":2,"text":"and we are making a real difference in people's lives."},"2742":{"dur":4,"text":"And, having this brought me through that time."},"2747":{"dur":2,"text":"It also brought our company through that time like,"},"2749":{"dur":3,"text":"this was what our team rallied around."},"2752":{"dur":1,"text":"And it wasn't easy and as I said like,"},"2754":{"dur":3,"text":"we had to make some hard decisions to set our business up for"},"2758":{"dur":3,"text":"success and set our brand up for the future and you know,"},"2761":{"dur":3,"text":"we decided to really focus on the things that"},"2765":{"dur":2,"text":"we did better than anyone else in the world,"},"2768":{"dur":7,"text":"that was thinking about building community and taking like engaging"},"2775":{"dur":3,"text":"with that community and creating products and creating innovative social"},"2779":{"dur":3,"text":"experiences that they would love and that they would respond to."},"2783":{"dur":2,"text":"And, having that focus,"},"2785":{"dur":2,"text":"and having like this purpose to kind of"},"2788":{"dur":3,"text":"drive that focus enabled us to you know,"},"2792":{"dur":4,"text":"kind of look for and start thinking about the future and"},"2796":{"dur":2,"text":"as we started thinking about the future of ModCloth like,"},"2798":{"dur":2,"text":"in the last like 12 months or so."},"2801":{"dur":5,"text":"You know, we knew that involved taking the brand to the next level,"},"2806":{"dur":3,"text":"part of that is, thinking about what a physical presence"},"2810":{"dur":2,"text":"means for ModCloth and what that would like."},"2813":{"dur":3,"text":"And you know whether that's pop ups or fit shops"},"2817":{"dur":2,"text":"or guide shops or some combination of them,"},"2819":{"dur":3,"text":"brick-and-mortar stores;"},"2823":{"dur":1,"text":"we knew that was where we wanted to go."},"2825":{"dur":4,"text":"We also knew that we needed to work on our own proprietary products,"},"2830":{"dur":2,"text":"so thinking about designing things that you could not"},"2832":{"dur":2,"text":"find anywhere because we know our customer best and we"},"2835":{"dur":1,"text":"know what would fit her and we have all this like,"},"2836":{"dur":2,"text":"great data on what works for her."},"2839":{"dur":4,"text":"So, in order to do that we actually decided to hire and a new CEO,"},"2844":{"dur":3,"text":"someone who had retail experience and who"},"2847":{"dur":2,"text":"had kind of done all of those things,"},"2849":{"dur":1,"text":"had brick-and-mortar experience,"},"2851":{"dur":2,"text":"understood proprietary brands."},"2854":{"dur":5,"text":"And our new CEO started in January, his name is Matt."},"2860":{"dur":2,"text":"And you know, since January we have actually"},"2863":{"dur":2,"text":"already launched our first fit shop,"},"2866":{"dur":2,"text":"our first fit pop up."},"2868":{"dur":2,"text":"We did this in LA about a month ago."},"2871":{"dur":1,"text":"And it was incredible like,"},"2872":{"dur":3,"text":"we had customers, community members linking up around the block,"},"2877":{"dur":4,"text":"hundreds of them, some of them waiting for hours to actually get in"},"2881":{"dur":2,"text":"and be able to try in our products and interact with each other,"},"2884":{"dur":8,"text":"interact with the brands and you know, all of this is possible,"},"2892":{"dur":1,"text":"you know like, moving forward,"},"2894":{"dur":3,"text":"thinking about the future of ModCloth because of"},"2897":{"dur":2,"text":"that core and that purpose and I think like,"},"2900":{"dur":3,"text":"it's part of why I am so passionate about sharing"},"2904":{"dur":2,"text":"this message with other entrepreneurs is because"},"2906":{"dur":5,"text":"I feel like it's easy to think about like,"},"2912":{"dur":1,"text":"there is just this kind of list of things"},"2914":{"dur":1,"text":"that I need to do as an entrepreneur,"},"2915":{"dur":2,"text":"and I need you to check them off and I need to grow a business,"},"2917":{"dur":1,"text":"and I needed to do this and need to do that."},"2919":{"dur":3,"text":"And, I am not sure that like this concept"},"2923":{"dur":2,"text":"is on that like, well-known list."},"2925":{"dur":5,"text":"This concept is like find your purpose and find what you're doing."},"2931":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'd like it to be that."},"2932":{"dur":3,"text":"I also don't think that the check-off the list is like"},"2936":{"dur":1,"text":"actually you're saying that people should be doing."},"2938":{"dur":3,"text":"Guess I like - I feel like all entrepreneurs have different"},"2941":{"dur":2,"text":"stories and like come from different backgrounds"},"2943":{"dur":2,"text":"and kind of approach in different ways."},"2945":{"dur":4,"text":"But I do think this is one thing that like every business or"},"2950":{"dur":5,"text":"it's really nowhere it's going in order to weather rough times"},"2955":{"dur":3,"text":"and to be headed in the right direction in good times."},"2959":{"dur":3,"text":"Like this is probably like the most important"},"2962":{"dur":1,"text":"thing that I would leave you guys with."},"2965":{"dur":4,"text":"And I would love to answer some questions."},"2970":{"dur":2,"text":"Thank you for having me here today."},"2977":{"dur":0,"text":"Okay."},"2981":{"dur":4,"text":"So you mentioned that it's okay to look back and cringe."},"2985":{"dur":2,"text":"But is it possible that your earlier choices even when"},"2988":{"dur":2,"text":"you look back you feel that it is unsophisticated,"},"2990":{"dur":3,"text":"it actually fits the young people of that same age group they"},"2994":{"dur":3,"text":"actually prefer the unsophisticated versions of styles."},"2998":{"dur":5,"text":"So the question was it's okay to look back"},"3003":{"dur":2,"text":"and cringe but sometimes you find that..."},"3005":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah maybe the naive version actually fits."},"3008":{"dur":0,"text":"Yeah."},"3009":{"dur":3,"text":"Yeah, that the naive version is better for a certain"},"3013":{"dur":2,"text":"age group or like for a certain customer."},"3015":{"dur":4,"text":"So I think I see what you mean and I do think there is definitely"},"3020":{"dur":5,"text":"some validity to - like I don't think it's about necessarily"},"3026":{"dur":4,"text":"like looking back and saying like that wasn't cutting edge"},"3030":{"dur":3,"text":"or that doesn't feel cutting edge because everything will"},"3034":{"dur":3,"text":"feel stale kind of a few years into the future."},"3038":{"dur":4,"text":"So I do think there is definitely validity to kind of -"},"3042":{"dur":3,"text":"like I feel like maybe what you are asking about is like"},"3045":{"dur":3,"text":"a purposeful throwback or something that feels more,"},"3049":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't know, kind of retro."},"3052":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think that's totally valid."},"3056":{"dur":8,"text":"I do think though that if you - so if you feel good about what you're"},"3064":{"dur":5,"text":"putting out into the world like part of the thing that I want"},"3070":{"dur":4,"text":"to convey is like if you feel good about it like get it out there"},"3075":{"dur":3,"text":"and don't just kind of sit on it and hold it in because you want"},"3079":{"dur":2,"text":"to make it perfect because it will never be perfect."},"3082":{"dur":3,"text":"But, yeah, I do think that there is validity"},"3085":{"dur":1,"text":"to looking back and saying like,"},"3087":{"dur":1,"text":"well, look, this is actually great and it's"},"3088":{"dur":2,"text":"like perfect again in this moment in time."},"3095":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes, in the back."},"3096":{"dur":3,"text":"Can you talk a little bit about the transition that your company"},"3100":{"dur":5,"text":"made between filling a simple need as a small company selling"},"3105":{"dur":0,"text":"to consumers and you know that they want a product and then"},"3106":{"dur":4,"text":"being able to actually empower those consumers,"},"3110":{"dur":1,"text":"like fulfil yourself and like being able to empower"},"3112":{"dur":6,"text":"your consumers and what contributes to that cycle."},"3119":{"dur":7,"text":"So the question is about how - what was the transition for ModCloth"},"3126":{"dur":2,"text":"from going from like a purely transactional relationship with our"},"3129":{"dur":4,"text":"community to actually empowering them to be part of the process."},"3135":{"dur":4,"text":"Yeah, I think - I mean I do think a lot of that"},"3140":{"dur":3,"text":"for ModCloth story was timing for us."},"3144":{"dur":7,"text":"Like I said, we were kind of - I was like thinking about taking the business"},"3151":{"dur":5,"text":"to the next level at this time where Facebook was really gaining traction"},"3157":{"dur":3,"text":"and like all this stuff on the social web was happening."},"3160":{"dur":4,"text":"So for me, it like intuitively made sense that whatever business"},"3165":{"dur":3,"text":"I was starting like this had to be a part of it like I look at"},"3168":{"dur":3,"text":"the way I was using Facebook and the way my friends were interacting"},"3172":{"dur":4,"text":"on Facebook and it made sense to me that like because my customers"},"3176":{"dur":2,"text":"were probably pretty similar to me and my friends that they would"},"3179":{"dur":3,"text":"want to interact in that way as well and not just with the brand"},"3183":{"dur":2,"text":"but with kind of each other on the website."},"3186":{"dur":4,"text":"And giving them that opportunity was going to be something"},"3190":{"dur":3,"text":"that would be not just useful for us because we learn
