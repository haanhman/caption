to."},"441":{"dur":4,"text":"When I told the executive editor of The New\nYork Times that I wanted to go to Sarajevo,"},"446":{"dur":4,"text":"at that point, 45 foreign correspondents had\nbeen killed, dozens wounded."},"450":{"dur":4,"text":"He said, well, I guess the line starts and\nends with you."},"454":{"dur":4,"text":"They would much rather sit in Paris or follow\nthe secretary of

wanted\nto go into."},"467":{"dur":11,"text":"And so I actually had a fairly, you know,\nprominent and rewarded career at The Times"},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"because I was quite selective about where\nI went."},"481":{"dur":4,"text":"For instance, I covered the first Gulf War,\nand I had no interest in going to the press"},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"conferences run by Schwarzkopf or anywhere\nelse."},"488":{"dur":4,"text":"And so I was always out on the front lines\ninterviewing lance corporals, sleeping in"},"492":{"dur":1,"text":"foxholes."},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"I went into

Marine."},"506":{"dur":1,"text":"And newspapers needed it."},"507":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean, indeed, my reporting for the first\nGulf War was submitted by The New York Times"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"for the Pulitzer."},"515":{"dur":6,"text":"So I was selective about where I placed myself\nand what I was doing, and because there wasn't"},"521":{"dur":4,"text":"much competition, partly because that kind\nof work is dangerous and partly because it's"},"526":{"dur":1,"text":"not prestigious."},"527":{"dur":5,"text":"I mean, there is a whole element at elite\njournalistic institutions like The Times that"},"532":{"dur":7,"text":"want to hang around with the powerful, that\nwant to sort of in essence be integrated into"},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"the circle of the power elite, and I never\nhad any interest in that."},"542":{"dur":5,"text":"JAY: Now, you are still able to keep within\nthe bounds of keeping your job."},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"Did you ever have to compromise in any way?"},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"Did you find any editorial interference?"},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"This is all leading up to the speech where\nclearly they didn't like it."},"556":{"dur":1,"text":"HEDGES: Well, let's be clear."},"557":{"dur":7,"text":"I mean, American journalism, unlike European\njournalism, is quite restrictive in its form."},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"And you ingest the form of The New York Times."},"568":{"dur":4,"text":"You know how to write a New York Times story."},"572":{"dur":6,"text":"So the form itself precludes--the boundaries\nare so narrow that you can't do the kinds"},"579":{"dur":5,"text":"of things you could do if you were writing\nfor Liberazione or The Guardian or something,"},"584":{"dur":6,"text":"which is make comments outside that would\nbe considered editorializing."},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"So the form itself is constrictive."},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"That's the first part."},"594":{"dur":6,"text":"The second part is that because I was writing\non the ground, I mean, even though I was in"},"601":{"dur":4,"text":"Gaza, I was writing what I saw."},"606":{"dur":4,"text":"So I was in Gaza, for instance, when Israeli\nF-16s bombed Gaza."},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"I went to the site where the bombing was."},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"I counted the number of corpses."},"615":{"dur":4,"text":"I described those who appeared to be children\nor those--it was quite hands-on."},"620":{"dur":4,"text":"JAY: So as long as you're saying this happened,\nthat happened, you can verify what you're"},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"saying, and they would print it."},"626":{"dur":1,"text":"HEDGES: Right."},"627":{"dur":3,"text":"And yet, of course, the Israelis hated that\nreporting, because the spin they were putting"},"630":{"dur":4,"text":"out of it on that particular incident, you\nknow, they would always talk about a surgical"},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"strike against a bomb-making unit."},"637":{"dur":6,"text":"Well, you know, dropping a 500 pound iron\nfragmentation bomb in a densely populated"},"643":{"dur":6,"text":"refugee camp is not a surgical strike, and\nhalf the time there weren't any bomb-makers"},"649":{"dur":4,"text":"anywhere nearby, I mean, you know, when you\nget on the ground."},"654":{"dur":5,"text":"And so that reporting rankled the Israelis\nquite a bit."},"659":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, logistically, living in Gaza at the time\nwas very unpleasant."},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"Getting to the site where an attack was was\nextremely difficult."},"667":{"dur":5,"text":"About 60 percent of my time was just spent\ntrying to get where something happened."},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"And a lot of reporters didn't want to do it."},"674":{"dur":3,"text":"A lot of reporters didn't want to be in Kosovo,\ndidn't want to be in Bosnia, didn't want to"},"678":{"dur":5,"text":"be in these physically difficult places."},"683":{"dur":4,"text":"But once I was there, I would say the paper\nwas quite happy to have it."},"688":{"dur":5,"text":"JAY: Part of most Americans' religion, whether\nthey are religious or not in terms of the"},"693":{"dur":4,"text":"way they identify, is Americanism."},"697":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, you go to school and you put your\nhand on your chest and I pledge allegiance."},"701":{"dur":9,"text":"When you were younger, growing up, going to\nseminary school, you know, before you start"},"710":{"dur":4,"text":"realizing what's going on in Latin America\nand the Middle East, how much is Americanism"},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"part of you?"},"717":{"dur":10,"text":"HEDGES: Not much, because although I was a\nkid, my father was hauling me off to antiwar"},"727":{"dur":5,"text":"demonstrations and in fact told me when I\nwas about 12 or something that if the Vietnam"},"733":{"dur":3,"text":"War was still being fought when I was 18 and\nI was drafted, he would go to prison with"},"736":{"dur":1,"text":"me."},"737":{"dur":4,"text":"And I still have this, like, vision of sitting,\nlike, for two years in a jail cell with my"},"742":{"dur":1,"text":"dad."},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"So that forces you to--by the way, he was\na vet."},"745":{"dur":1,"text":"He was a sergeant in North Africa."},"747":{"dur":1,"text":"JAY: Is he still alive?"},"748":{"dur":1,"text":"HEDGES: No."},"749":{"dur":1,"text":"He was a sergeant in North Africa in World\nWar II."},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I mean, war is something he knew, although\nhe was a cryptographer, he wasn't--he was"},"754":{"dur":1,"text":"around combat units."},"755":{"dur":6,"text":"So those made me ask questions."},"761":{"dur":7,"text":"And I grew up in a very rural all-white farm\ntown in upstate New York, where my father's"},"769":{"dur":5,"text":"open support for Martin Luther King and the\ncivil rights movement was quite contentious."},"775":{"dur":4,"text":"Martin Luther King in these rural white enclaves\nat that time in the '60s was one of the most"},"779":{"dur":1,"text":"hated men in America."},"781":{"dur":3,"text":"And then to see my father come out in terms--in\nsupport of gay rights."},"785":{"dur":3,"text":"So my father was a kind of lightning rod throughout\nhis life."},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"JAY: And your father would have been radicalized\nin the '30s."},"791":{"dur":6,"text":"HEDGES: Well, I think my father was, like\nmany of his generation, radicalized by World"},"798":{"dur":1,"text":"War II."},"799":{"dur":3,"text":"We've mythologized World War II."},"802":{"dur":3,"text":"He and most of my uncles were in the war."},"805":{"dur":8,"text":"I had one uncle that was physically and emotionally\ndestroyed in the South Pacific, drank himself"},"814":{"dur":1,"text":"to death in a trailer."},"815":{"dur":5,"text":"I mean, and I think that that wasn't uncommon\nwith combat vets who suffered from what we"},"821":{"dur":3,"text":"now call post traumatic stress disorder--and\nthere was no name for it then and very little"},"824":{"dur":2,"text":"understanding or sympathy."},"826":{"dur":6,"text":"So even though--my uncle, for instance, mailed\nall of his medals back to the Pentagon."},"833":{"dur":1,"text":"He hated war."},"835":{"dur":1,"text":"He was destroyed by war."},"836":{"dur":1,"text":"In our family, he was an embarrassment."},"837":{"dur":6,"text":"I mean, there was no alcohol in the [m{ns]\nwhere I grew up, and yet my uncle was a drunk."},"844":{"dur":6,"text":"And it--you know, I think there were probably\ntens of thousands of families who were caring"},"850":{"dur":7,"text":"for people who had been psychologically and\nphysically maimed, but they were shunted aside"},"857":{"dur":2,"text":"because they didn't fit that kind of mythic\nnarrative."},"860":{"dur":3,"text":"And I really grew up because of that in the\nshadow of World War II."},"864":{"dur":4,"text":"The shadow of the war fell upon my family."},"868":{"dur":8,"text":"And so, you know, all of those factors and\nall of the stances that my father took meant"},"876":{"dur":4,"text":"that I was forced at a young age to ask questions\nthat maybe, you know, many of my peers were"},"881":{"dur":1,"text":"not asking."},"882":{"dur":3,"text":"JAY: So when you go to Latin America and then\nyou go to the Middle East, this is not a big"},"885":{"dur":2,"text":"surprise to you what U.S. foreign-policy is."},"888":{"dur":2,"text":"If anything, it's more a confirmation of a\nlot of things your father was saying."},"891":{"dur":4,"text":"HEDGES: Well, you know, I would say actually\nthe really seminal

things."},"915":{"dur":7,"text":"I remember going back to the chaplain at Colgate\nafter a few months of living in the projects"},"922":{"dur":5,"text":"and just walking into his office and sitting\ndown and saying, are we created to suffer?"},"928":{"dur":6,"text":"And his answer was: is there any love that\nisn't?"},"935":{"dur":7,"text":"And I think for a white person of
