year,"},"160":{"dur":2,"text":"and they work for\nindigenous organizations."},"162":{"dur":2,"text":"They can do-- it's basically\ntechnical assistance"},"165":{"dur":1,"text":"because a lot of\nthese organizations"},"166":{"dur":2,"text":"not only need money, but they\nneed technical assistance."},"169":{"dur":1,"text":"So sometimes, you\nbuild a website."},"171":{"dur":1,"text":"Sometimes, you

countries"},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"in the world-- on 4 continents."},"348":{"dur":3,"text":"We visited thousands\nof individuals."},"351":{"dur":3,"text":"We captured the stories\nof about 50 individuals"},"354":{"dur":3,"text":"and\/or their families who\nlive on less than $1 a day."},"358":{"dur":1,"text":"And we told their\nstories about how"},"359":{"dur":4,"text":"they get through

countries"},"389":{"dur":3,"text":"and took 15,000\nphotographs-- 225 of them"},"393":{"dur":1,"text":"ended up in the book."},"394":{"dur":1,"text":"So we went through a\nlarge editing process"},"396":{"dur":1,"text":"to get these pictures in there."},"398":{"dur":3,"text":"And the stories are told in\nand around the photographs."},"401":{"dur":1,"text":"And so when you\nsee a photograph,"},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"the story is told around it."},"404":{"dur":2,"text":"And, of course, there's a\nlot of stuff in the book"},"406":{"dur":1,"text":"just about poverty in

see this\nquick video from Pierce"},"417":{"dur":2,"text":"on what we discovered\naround the world."},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"So I wanted to spend a\nmoment talking about some"},"427":{"dur":1,"text":"of the actual scenes\nand the people"},"429":{"dur":3,"text":"that you saw in that video just\nbecause everybody that you saw"},"432":{"dur":3,"text":"in that video, there's a\nstory behind their lives"},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"that's quite important, quite\ncompelling, and probably worth"},"438":{"dur":4,"text":"telling to people\nlike us who don't have"},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"an awful lot of experience\nwith individuals"},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"who live their kinds of lives."},"447":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's see if I can\nget this to work."},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, I'm only going to tell\na few stories because I"},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"want to show a few\nother videos today."},"456":{"dur":4,"text":"But in Bolivia,\nwe met this woman."},"460":{"dur":4,"text":"And you saw her picture very,\nvery quickly on that video."},"465":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, she works in the hills of\na mountainside in the Bolivian"},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"Alps."},"471":{"dur":3,"text":"And she is a subsistence farmer."},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"And by the way, most\nof the world's poor--"},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"about 55% of the poorest\npeople in the world"},"479":{"dur":3,"text":"are, in fact,\nsubsistence farmers."},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"Most of them are women."},"483":{"dur":3,"text":"And most of them produce,\nwell, actually a little bit"},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"more than half of all the\nagriculture in the world"},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"to feed the world."},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"So they do a

she"},"521":{"dur":1,"text":"said the Western\nworld has actually"},"522":{"dur":3,"text":"destroyed her crop because\nwe in the Western world"},"525":{"dur":4,"text":"have produced most\nof the warming that's"},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"taking place in the world."},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"And as a result, she gets far\nless rain, far less water,"},"535":{"dur":3,"text":"far less of anything that\nshe needs to grow her crop."},"538":{"dur":4,"text":"And now, her beans\nare all dried up."},"543":{"dur":4,"text":"And her wheat doesn't\nmature the way it used to."},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"As a result, she had\nto sell her animals."},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"And now, she is\ntotally impoverished."},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"She had five children,\nbut they all moved away."},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"She lives in a house with\nno heat, with no phone,"},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"with no electricity."},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"And in the evening, if\nshe needs any help at

I don't know."},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"But look at her hands."},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"One of the things that I've\ndiscovered over the years"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"in traveling around the\nworld for the United Nations,"},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"for Human Rights Watch\nis that I've never"},"582":{"dur":6,"text":"found a woman who doesn't\nwork so, so hard-- never."},"589":{"dur":4,"text":"Certainly, her hands\nare evidence of that."},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"In Peru."},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"I wanted to hone in on Peru\nbecause she actually has"},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"the second most\npopular occupation that"},"600":{"dur":4,"text":"the world's poor endeavour\nin, and that's recycling."},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"She recycles every\nday

can."},"632":{"dur":3,"text":"She walks those streets\nfor about 14 hours a day,"},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"spends a few hours\ngetting her kids to bed,"},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"and then brings in whatever\nshe's been able to find"},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"to a recycling center--\non the average,"},"644":{"dur":3,"text":"probably makes somewhere\nabout $2.10 a day."},"647":{"dur":3,"text":"That's for a family of six."},"651":{"dur":1,"text":"Her children, of\ncourse, help her."},"652":{"dur":1,"text":"And these children\ndo not go to school"},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"nor will they likely\never go to school."},"659":{"dur":3,"text":"This is at the end of the day\nat the recycling center, turning"},"662":{"dur":3,"text":"in whatever they've\nbeen able to find."},"666":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is their life."},"669":{"dur":1,"text":"That's when she gets paid."},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"She then takes the kids home."},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"They live in a one-room\nlittle apartment--"},"675":{"dur":1,"text":"no kitchen, no nothing."},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"They eat outdoors, or they\ngo to borrow some

who's"},"684":{"dur":4,"text":"18, who is now following\nin the same cycle."},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"And this cycle of poverty\nis very, very hard"},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"to break unless you're there and\nyou give them the kind of help"},"692":{"dur":0,"text":"that they need."},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"By the way, we\ndiscovered over the years"},"699":{"dur":1,"text":"and through the\nmaking of the book"},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"is that one of the biggest\ndrivers of poverty,"},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"particularly with regards\nto women and children,"},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"is domestic violence."},"706":{"dur":3,"text":"It's all over the world,\nparticularly in South America."},"709":{"dur":3,"text":"But in Libya, we found\nthese individuals."},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"In Libya, which

year,"},"756":{"dur":1,"text":"they die as a result\nof childbirth,"},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"usually from the occurrence of\na fistula that's not repaired"},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"and gets infected, and they die."},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, a fistula\noccurs sometimes when"},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"a child is stuck\nin the birth canal."},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"And since they\ndon't have doctors,"},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"they don't have access\nto medical care,"},"772":{"dur":2,"text":"usually the child is pulled out."},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"The child's, then, foot\ngoes through the

later."},"799":{"dur":3,"text":"What happens to these women\nis they spend half their day"},"802":{"dur":3,"text":"on the toilet because they\ncannot control their urine"},"805":{"dur":10,"text":"or, actually, any kind\nof fecal removement."},"816":{"dur":5,"text":"So they can't control it\nbecause, again, these two"},"821":{"dur":1,"text":"parts of their\norgans are attached,"},"823":{"dur":1,"text":"and they shouldn't be."},"825":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is the way they live."},"826":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, the biggest problem\nthat they have in life"},"829":{"dur":1,"text":"is not so much that\nthey live this way,"},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"it's that they're ostracized\nby their villages because"},"833":{"dur":1,"text":"of their smell."},"835":{"dur":1,"text":"Here, they have\ndeveloped these odors"},"837":{"dur":3,"text":"as a result, again, of\ntwo attached organs."},"841":{"dur":1,"text":"They're kicked out\nof their
