that's\nblank."},"599":{"dur":4,"text":"We all build on the shoulders of those who\ncame before us."},"603":{"dur":3,"text":"So, you know, it's kind of a tragedy\ntoday, in some sense, I

quality even in\nthose days and the,"},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"the idea was, how do you improve it?"},"633":{"dur":0,"text":"How do you improve it?"},"634":{"dur":3,"text":"How do you get kind of, move it along to\nwhere it is today?"},"641":{"dur":6,"text":"To infuse the disciplines of the business\nschool, then you had to help them"},"647":{"dur":5,"text":"try to figure out how do you bring your\ndiscipline to bear on something,"},"652":{"dur":4,"text":"on the profession programs which was to\nsay managerial leadership."},"658":{"dur":5,"text":"And it wasn't obvious, but there were some\nguidelines that you can begin with."},"664":{"dur":4,"text":"Well I, I think it in, the, the,"},"668":{"dur":7,"text":"the school as I knew it and sort of in, in\nRJ's era is when it kind of begin."},"675":{"dur":5,"text":"And this I don't know maybe sounds a\nlittle corny today, but the, the, the,"},"681":{"dur":8,"text":"somehow there emerged a name that said, we\ncalled it balanced excellence."},"693":{"dur":1,"text":"What it really meant was."},"695":{"dur":5,"text":"We wanna do, a, as a single faculty, not,\nnot have specialists so that some did one"},"701":{"dur":6,"text":"thing and some did another, but as a\nfaculty we wanna do outstanding research."},"709":{"dur":4,"text":"But we also wanna do an outstanding job of\nteaching, formulating, and"},"713":{"dur":1,"text":"teaching the professional programs."},"716":{"dur":3,"text":"And to do it as a single faculty."},"721":{"dur":3,"text":"That's like saying you wanna to do the R&D\nand"},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"the production and the sales all in the\nsame group."},"728":{"dur":1,"text":"That is not an easy model."},"731":{"dur":6,"text":"And but, but we felt that was the best way\nto do things like bring"},"738":{"dur":6,"text":"the disciplines to bear on managerial\neducation, leadership and, and management."},"746":{"dur":5,"text":"We also felt that, that any of the\nprofessional programs"},"751":{"dur":4,"text":"needed to be rooted in, in strong academic\nresearch."},"757":{"dur":6,"text":"And you have to keep in mind, research is\nsort of the only activity that people and"},"763":{"dur":4,"text":"that faculty engage in, it's that, that\nbuilds their intellectual capital."},"767":{"dur":3,"text":"Practically everything else we do, you,\nyou, you're living off your capital."},"774":{"dur":5,"text":"Well we started that model, and as, and,\nand we made it work."},"781":{"dur":6,"text":"But of all the things that are good in\nalmost any academic university,"},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"when you say, how does it start?"},"791":{"dur":2,"text":"It's the faculty and the students who make\nit happen."},"795":{"dur":5,"text":"You know, the, the, the, the deans can try\nto help formulate the direction."},"802":{"dur":6,"text":"RJ was great like Ernie was at providing\nresources, so that one of the things that"},"808":{"dur":7,"text":"struck me when I came here was, I never\nheard the words, I can't or we can't."},"816":{"dur":4,"text":"We heard the words like well let's see\nwhat we have to do to do it."},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"And so good ideas were implemented."},"826":{"dur":4,"text":"But when you say where do the good ideas\ncome from and how did they implement it,"},"831":{"dur":4,"text":"you've got to have a first class faculty\nvery deep in their disciplines."},"836":{"dur":3,"text":"Who wanted to take on managerial problems."},"839":{"dur":1,"text":"They wanted to lead."},"841":{"dur":4,"text":"That's something your faculty has was\nnoted for"},"846":{"dur":5,"text":"at the very beginning is leading the\nchanges that are going to occur."},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"But there's only so many hours in a day."},"855":{"dur":6,"text":"Research and teaching are very different\nactivities in some sense and it,"},"861":{"dur":3,"text":"it's like I'm sure the faculty felt, we're\nliving in two worlds."},"867":{"dur":1,"text":"we, we need about a 28 or"},"868":{"dur":4,"text":"a 30-hour a day to get all this done, but\nit's the same on the students."},"873":{"dur":4,"text":"You have to have first class students who\nwanna learn in that kind of"},"877":{"dur":0,"text":"an environment."},"878":{"dur":6,"text":"And that's always been the characteristic,\nso the idea was, strong academic programs."},"885":{"dur":4,"text":"Professional programs resting on\noutstanding research,"},"890":{"dur":1,"text":"outstanding scholarship."},"891":{"dur":4,"text":"And the other thing was, if you could link\nthose two together."},"895":{"dur":2,"text":"Th, the courses would keep up."},"898":{"dur":4,"text":"They would even lead the changing who were\ntaking place in the world."},"903":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can see this today."},"905":{"dur":4,"text":"I, I, I still read, with this one last\ncomment."},"910":{"dur":4,"text":"I still read the annual report very\ncarefully."},"915":{"dur":3,"text":"Well if you look at the annual report, for\nexample for 2012,"},"919":{"dur":6,"text":"you find something like about 60\npublications."},"926":{"dur":5,"text":"But you also find 25 new courses and I bet\nthat if"},"931":{"dur":5,"text":"you looked at the change from one year to\nthe next in the elective structure."},"936":{"dur":5,"text":"You'd probably find 20, 25% new material\nin those courses as well."},"942":{"dur":1,"text":"And so, you say where does that come from?"},"944":{"dur":3,"text":"Well it comes from the academic, from the\nresearch base."},"947":{"dur":4,"text":"And the faculty and the students are the\nones that make that happen, and"},"952":{"dur":4,"text":"you have to have that that interchange."},"956":{"dur":3,"text":"And of course, you all have mentioned the\nPhD program there is no"},"960":{"dur":5,"text":"question that the PhD program in this\nschool is an outstanding program."},"965":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's got to rest on a research base."},"968":{"dur":2,"text":"There's got to be links to a research\nbase."},"971":{"dur":5,"text":"But, you got the faculty and students to\nthank for making this happen."},"976":{"dur":2,"text":"I guess it's very gratifying, I'm sure it\nis to RJ,"},"979":{"dur":2,"text":"it is to me, that they're still doing it."},"982":{"dur":1,"text":">> Mm."},"983":{"dur":1,"text":">> That they're still doing it."},"985":{"dur":3,"text":"And all you have to do is look at the\nprogram today,"},"990":{"dur":4,"text":"and if anything you'd probably have more\npolitical economy."},"994":{"dur":3,"text":"You got more of the disciplines

days."},"1029":{"dur":2,"text":"Cuz there was not that was not an\nestablished model."},"1033":{"dur":1,"text":">> How, how'd we the fa-"},"1034":{"dur":1,"text":">> How to get the faculty to-"},"1036":{"dur":2,"text":">> Well, I, I think we did two things."},"1038":{"dur":7,"text":"One was, we were able to convince some\nsenior scholars, who came here."},"1046":{"dur":5,"text":"That were representative of, of\ndisciplines that were new to the business."},"1052":{"dur":3,"text":"I came here as a faculty member in 1960,\n61, I guess."},"1055":{"dur":2,"text":"And I, I was an old
