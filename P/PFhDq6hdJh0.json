had\nthe strongest social media presence,"},"3702":{"dur":4,"text":"but we didn't see that \nplacing third at, at 23 percent."},"3707":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'll ask the

\nof history, they will continue to,"},"4701":{"dur":2,"text":"and I think that people\nwill always be scared of them."},"4703":{"dur":3,"text":"But I think that's actually why \nthey have so much

very effective."},"4714":{"dur":1,"text":"They take a lot of courage though."},"4716":{"dur":3,"text":"It's very difficult \nto, uh, organize, uh, a protest,"},"4720":{"dur":2,"text":"uh, a

think there's always that,"},"4749":{"dur":2,"text":"that fear of protest \nbecause a lot's on the line,"},"4752":{"dur":4,"text":"um, but when, uh, y- you're ready\nto die for what you're fighting

real interesting \nin the Toronto election."},"4905":{"dur":1,"text":"So you started\nwith Naheed Nenshi"},"4907":{"dur":2,"text":"who, in my view,\nhe's really great on Twitter"},"4909":{"dur":1,"text":"because he's so real,\nand he doesn't seem like"},"4911":{"dur":1,"text":"a communications person \nis writing his tweets,"},"4913":{"dur":2,"text":"and he takes huge risks,\nlike responding to the trolls."},"4915":{"dur":3,"text":"So in the Toronto election, \nyou've got Rob and Doug Ford"},"4919":{"dur":1,"text":"who are very good \nat connecting with people,"},"4921":{"dur":2,"text":"do you feel \nlike Olivia Chow tried \u2013"},"4924":{"dur":1,"text":"you have the insight \nfrom that campaign \u2013"},"4925":{"dur":3,"text":"did you try and use Twitter \nin a way similar to Nenshi,"},"4929":{"dur":2,"text":"where you you took risks \nand allowed her to really be herself?"},"4932":{"dur":4,"text":"Or, looking back, do you now feel\nthat there was room to do that more"},"4936":{"dur":1,"text":"or was it just not \nher personality?"},"4938":{"dur":2,"text":"Just, how do you think you used it\nand did you do the Nenshi thing"},"4940":{"dur":2,"text":"or did you do the traditional thing \nwhere it's sort of managed?"},"4943":{"dur":2,"text":"[Jennifer] That's, uh, a great question.\nI'll give you an honest answer."},"4946":{"dur":3,"text":"So, Olivia, day-to-day,\nactually does her own tweets."},"4950":{"dur":4,"text":"But due to the time commitments\nthat are involved"},"4954":{"dur":1,"text":"on a political campaign,\nlike all the debates,"},"4955":{"dur":1,"text":"all the debate prep,\nthe media interviews,"},"4957":{"dur":3,"text":"uh, she worked- there were two of us \nwho supported her on tweets."},"4961":{"dur":2,"text":"And as the campaign \ngot busier and busier,"},"4963":{"dur":2,"text":"we would send out tweets \nthat were more kinda like,"},"4966":{"dur":3,"text":"promoting events and re-tweeting things,\nuh, working with her."},"4969":{"dur":1,"text":"And that was a bit of a sacrifice"},"4971":{"dur":2,"text":"because Olivia's tweets \nare always the best."},"4975":{"dur":2,"text":"They're always better\nthan anything I can suggest"},"4977":{"dur":2,"text":"or anyone on the cam- campaign can"},"4979":{"dur":2,"text":"because they're authentic \nand you can tell it's in her voice."},"4981":{"dur":2,"text":"Uh, but the question \nyou have to ask yourself is,"},"4984":{"dur":2,"text":"the candidate \nonly has so much time \u2013"},"4986":{"dur":1,"text":"and there's no question \nall the candidates would agree,"},"4988":{"dur":1,"text":"Olivia was \nthe hardest working candidate \u2013"},"4990":{"dur":2,"text":"but where do you want\nher spending her time"},"4992":{"dur":2,"text":"you know, answering all those,\nthose tweets,"},"4994":{"dur":2,"text":"and Nenshi's really \nthe only one who does it."},"4996":{"dur":1,"text":"Like, he, he- I would argue,\nhe is really one"},"4998":{"dur":2,"text":"of the only one's in the world \nwho actually spends that time,"},"5000":{"dur":2,"text":"up late at night,\ngoing through all those tweets"},"5002":{"dur":2,"text":"and maybe he's even \na bit obsessive about it."},"5004":{"dur":2,"text":"But I love it, it makes him \nreally unique and very accessible."},"5007":{"dur":2,"text":"Uh, but on our campaign,\nwe didn't have that time."},"5010":{"dur":2,"text":"So we had to strike a balance,\nuh, hands down,"},"5012":{"dur":2,"text":"we knew that Olivia was,\nuh, sending more tweets"},"5015":{"dur":1,"text":"and responding \nthan the other candidates,"},"5016":{"dur":2,"text":"but yeah, Nenshi's on,\non another level."},"5019":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think it actually,\nlike, takes someone-"},"5021":{"dur":1,"text":"like, one day I hope\nto be a candidate"},"5023":{"dur":2,"text":"and I would never give that up \nbecause of my background."},"5025":{"dur":2,"text":"And, uh, I think\nit's really candidate driven"},"5027":{"dur":1,"text":"but there's just not\nenough hours in the day"},"5029":{"dur":1,"text":"an- and unfortunately, in..."},"5031":{"dur":3,"text":"Um, I also think 2010 was a different,\nuh, election for Nenshi with Twitter"},"5034":{"dur":2,"text":"and he was ahead of his time \nand that really helped him."},"5037":{"dur":1,"text":"[woman 2] \nI have a quick question for you."},"5039":{"dur":2,"text":"We had John Laschinger\nactually come and speak,"},"5041":{"dur":3,"text":"um, to my students,\nmy research, uh, students \u2013"},"5044":{"dur":2,"text":"How we use Research in Politics,\nQualitative and Quantitative \u2013"},"5047":{"dur":2,"text":"and I teach over \nin the School of Media Studies."},"5049":{"dur":3,"text":"But I have a question for you,\nwould you say that,"},"5053":{"dur":3,"text":"and I know this is kind of,\nprobably, inside baseball,"},"5056":{"dur":4,"text":"but you're \u2013  I mean,\nsocial media, digital media,"},"5060":{"dur":3,"text":"it's an emerging technology \nand you're right, the older people,"},"5064":{"dur":2,"text":"like the over 40s, are the ones \nthat go out and actually,"},"5067":{"dur":1,"text":"you know, mark the ballot \non election day \u2013"},"5069":{"dur":3,"text":"but would you say \nthat Olivia's campaign was partially,"},"5072":{"dur":5,"text":"in part, undone by social media,\nin particular Kinsella's tweets,"},"5077":{"dur":3,"text":"like, do you think that\nthat helped her take a hit"},"5080":{"dur":1,"text":"or that cause her to take a hit?"},"5082":{"dur":2,"text":"[Jennifer] Yeah,\nso this is just a reference"},"5084":{"dur":1,"text":"to one of the other cam- \ncampaigns."},"5086":{"dur":1,"text":"Someone who had worked\non the Ford campaign"},"5088":{"dur":1,"text":"and then worked\non John Tory's campaign"},"5090":{"dur":3,"text":"who was always kind of, I think,\nstirring the pot on, on twitter."},"5093":{"dur":4,"text":"Uh, we also dealt with a lot\nof racism and sexism"},"5097":{"dur":2,"text":"as well as fake accounts \nand trolls."},"5100":{"dur":3,"text":"And as someone\nwho managed Olivia's accounts,"},"5103":{"dur":2,"text":"I actually became, like, numb"},"5105":{"dur":3,"text":"to some of the, uh, hate speech\nthat, that she was dealing with."},"5109":{"dur":1,"text":"Uh, I don't think so."},"5111":{"dur":1,"text":"I think there's,\nyou know, many factors"},"5112":{"dur":1,"text":"as, as we do a postmortem \nto figure out,"},"5114":{"dur":2,"text":"you know, why Olivia \ndidn't win the election,"},"5117":{"dur":3,"text":"uh, but I think \nthat social media only helped her."},"5120":{"dur":5,"text":"I think though that all the campaigns\nare using the, uh, social media tools"},"5125":{"dur":2,"text":"to both defend and attack,\nand you're gonna see that."},"5128":{"dur":1,"text":"So you're gonna see online,\nyour candidate"},"5130":{"dur":1,"text":"and your campaign staff \nare gonna take some hits."},"5131":{"dur":2,"text":"I think it's best just not\nto be sucked in, in by them"},"5134":{"dur":4,"text":"and to, uh, help journalist \nalso not get sucked in by those frames."},"5139":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I do- I don't think that had,\nhad much of an impact."},"5142":{"dur":4,"text":"I think that, uh, this was \nan unusual election."},"5147":{"dur":3,"text":"We had a provincial election,\nwe had a by-election,"},"5150":{"dur":4,"text":"we had a crack video, we had rehab,\nwe had a tumor, we had a switcheroo,"},"5155":{"dur":3,"text":"like, it was an unreal election\nand I think on top of that"},"5158":{"dur":3,"text":"there were many factors\nincluding, you know, transit strategy"},"5161":{"dur":1,"text":"and people voting\nfor who they thought"},"5163":{"dur":1,"text":"could take Ford out \nand the role of polls."},"5165":{"dur":3,"text":"So, yeah, but I, I don't think \nthat had much of an impact,"},"5169":{"dur":1,"text":"best I can see."},"5171":{"dur":1,"text":"[man 2] ...one more question?\n[Jennifer] Sure."},"5173":{"dur":2,"text":"Just about the- what you just said\nabout the role of polls"},"5175":{"dur":1,"text":"because the first thing\nthat came to mind"},"5177":{"dur":2,"text":"when you showed\n the social media success"},"5180":{"dur":2,"text":"of Olivia's campaign,\nwas the fact"},"5182":{"dur":1,"text":"that she was really\ntaking on water"},"5184":{"dur":2,"text":"from August on \nin the traditional media coverage,"},"5186":{"dur":2,"text":"and, even in something like The Star,\nwhich was normally friendly,"},"5189":{"dur":2,"text":"was just slow- slowly shifting \nover to Tory."},"5191":{"dur":3,"text":"And it seemed like polling \nwas driving that to a large extent,"},"5195":{"dur":2,"text":"it wasn't actually \nsubstantive policy discussion,"},"5197":{"dur":1,"text":"there was actually \na lot of criticism."},"5199":{"dur":3,"text":"So what role do you see polling play \nand how do you get around this,"},"5203":{"dur":2,"text":"uh, when you're doing \nsocial media strategy now,"},"5206":{"dur":3,"text":"when, when you get the, the constant,\nkind of, negative polling information?"},"5209":{"dur":2,"text":"[Jennifer] Yeah, it's really tough.\nI'm not sure I know the answer to that."},"5212":{"dur":3,"text":"I think in this election,\nvoters were obsessed with the polls"},"5216":{"dur":4,"text":"because of the fear of Ford,\nor in this case, Fords, plural,"},"5220":{"dur":2,"text":"and I think that..."},"5223":{"dur":1,"text":"I read a really great article \nwhich is,"},"5224":{"dur":2,"text":"you know, we, we look\nto the bestsellers,"},"5227":{"dur":3,"text":"uh, in, in novels \nto determine what we're gonna read,"},"5230":{"dur":2,"text":"an- and we look to the top movies\nto determine what we're gonna see,"},"5233":{"dur":2,"text":"and some people look to the polls \nto decide who they wanna vote for."},"5236":{"dur":2,"text":"Uh, that's not how,\nhow I cast my ballot"},"5238":{"dur":3,"text":"but some people wanna know that,\nyou know, they're doing the right thing"},"5241":{"dur":1,"text":"And, I think, early in the campaign\nwe were hoping"},"5243":{"dur":1,"text":"we were gonna be front of the polls \nand people would say,"},"5245":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Oh, I'm gonna vote for the frontrunner,\nand it's gonna be Olivia.\""},"5247":{"dur":2,"text":"And that shifted.\nAnd that was the challenge for us."},"5250":{"dur":1,"text":"Uh, it's really, really tricky."},"5251":{"dur":3,"text":"Uh, Olivia was the only major candidate \nto support ranked balloting,"},"5255":{"dur":3,"text":"and I think ranked balloting\nwould actually shift this poll issue"},"5259":{"dur":2,"text":"because if you could vote\nfor who you wanted to"},"5261":{"dur":2,"text":"and rank those votes \nand you knew that vote would matter,"},"5264":{"dur":1,"text":"I think people \nwould vote differently."},"5265":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I think,\nto actually address the poll issue,"},"5267":{"dur":2,"text":"which is not gonna go away,\nI mean, look at the popularity"},"5270":{"dur":2,"text":"and rise of Nate Silver \nand the 308 blog."},"5272":{"dur":2,"text":"Uh, I think it's only gonna get bigger \nand more data driven,"},"5275":{"dur":3,"text":"uh, but we have to actually push \nfor electoral reform."},"5278":{"dur":4,"text":"It's not a sexy topic, there are people\nwho even want ranked balloting"},"5282":{"dur":2,"text":"and didn't vote for Olivia,\nwhich makes no sense,"},"5284":{"dur":1,"text":"she's the only candidate \nsupporting it."},"5286":{"dur":4,"text":"Uh, but people are scared,\nright, really scared. So..."},"5292":{"dur":3,"text":"[Chandra] Okay, well thank you,\nuh, so much for this great talk"},"5295":{"dur":2,"text":"and we invite everyone \nto stick around."},"5298":{"dur":1,"text":"[Jennifer]\nRight, thank you so much."},"5300":{"dur":2,"text":"[applause]"},"5303":{"dur":1,"text":"[Jennifer] \nThank you so much."}}
