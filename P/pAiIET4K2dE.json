the\nnorther states."},"118":{"dur":3,"text":"However, it's very rare to\nfind, in western Minnesota,"},"121":{"dur":2,"text":"a curling league with\na rink of their own,"},"124":{"dur":2,"text":"one they don't have to\nshare with figure skaters"},"127":{"dur":3,"text":"or hockey players, but that's\njust what the Glacial Ridge"},"130":{"dur":3,"text":"Curling League, out of\nWilmer, is looking to

get started?"},"149":{"dur":4,"text":"- The city of Wilmer's\ncommunity education department"},"153":{"dur":4,"text":"and a group of us individuals\nwho wanted to start curling"},"158":{"dur":2,"text":"formed a partnership where\nwe were able to start"},"160":{"dur":4,"text":"an open curling league\nsponsored by the Community Ed"},"165":{"dur":3,"text":"and Recreation, they were\nable to locate stones"},"169":{"dur":1,"text":"which is one of the\nbiggest problems you have"},"171":{"dur":3,"text":"in starting a new curling club,\nis where do you find stones?"},"174":{"dur":3,"text":"They're not only hard to\nfind but they're expensive,"},"178":{"dur":3,"text":"so they were very\ninstrumental in finding grants"},"181":{"dur":3,"text":"so that we were able to get\nour first few sets of stones"},"185":{"dur":3,"text":"and we started a open\nprogram like that"},"188":{"dur":3,"text":"for the first two years\nuntil our membership grew"},"191":{"dur":3,"text":"where we decided to\nactually develop a charter"},"195":{"dur":3,"text":"and become a curling club\nwith the United States Curling"},"198":{"dur":3,"text":"Association, so\nthat's our beginning,"},"201":{"dur":2,"text":"already 12, 13 years ago."},"205":{"dur":3,"text":"- Wow, so why do you think\nyou were able to get,"},"208":{"dur":2,"text":"a, the support with the\ngrants, and b, able to get"},"211":{"dur":2,"text":"the support with the community\nand people wanting to play?"},"214":{"dur":3,"text":"- The grant that we received\nactually came through"},"217":{"dur":4,"text":"a foundation that was promoting\nintergenerational sports"},"222":{"dur":2,"text":"and intergenerational\nrecreation."},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"Curling is the perfect\nsport for such a thing"},"227":{"dur":2,"text":"because I can curl as a\ngrandpa, I can curl with my"},"230":{"dur":3,"text":"grandsons and my son and we\ncan put a curling team together"},"233":{"dur":2,"text":"and curl in a tournament, for\ninstance, there's not too many"},"236":{"dur":4,"text":"sports that have that range\nof ages that can do the sport."},"242":{"dur":2,"text":"- From eight to 80, we always\nsay, in terms of the ages"},"245":{"dur":3,"text":"that are very capable of curling"},"248":{"dur":3,"text":"and together, not just\nat different levels,"},"252":{"dur":2,"text":"because a lot of times,\nthose 80-year-olds can curl"},"255":{"dur":4,"text":"just as well as those of\nus that are in our mid-40s"},"259":{"dur":1,"text":"or whatever age it might be."},"261":{"dur":3,"text":"- So what about league draws\npeople in, do you think?"},"264":{"dur":1,"text":"- Maybe Randy can\nchip in on these a lot"},"266":{"dur":4,"text":"but I know for one, our draw\nage for our curling leagues"},"271":{"dur":3,"text":"is like from 35 to 45 to\n50, and that's the age"},"276":{"dur":3,"text":"where folks are looking\nfor some physical exercise"},"280":{"dur":4,"text":"to try to keep in shape,\ntheir children are grown now"},"284":{"dur":1,"text":"or they're able to\nget out of the house"},"286":{"dur":4,"text":"without babysitters and so\nforth, so there's a desire"},"291":{"dur":1,"text":"to get out and\nrecreate together."},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"- And it's a very social\nsport at all levels,"},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"even at the highly\ncompetitive level,"},"298":{"dur":3,"text":"even internationally,\nafter games are over,"},"301":{"dur":3,"text":"the teams sit down for\na friendly beverage"},"304":{"dur":3,"text":"and sometimes there can\nbe different languages"},"307":{"dur":3,"text":"but there's always the\ncommon language of English"},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"and most of the time,\nthose teams can sit around"},"313":{"dur":2,"text":"and talk about their curling\nexperiences afterwards"},"316":{"dur":3,"text":"so that helps drive all\nthe rest of us to grow"},"319":{"dur":4,"text":"our membership and our\ninvolvement of our fellow"},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"club members to get\ninvolved at those levels."},"326":{"dur":4,"text":"- Well, and I'm sure it also\nhelps drive your endeavor"},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"towards getting a new\narena built, correct?"},"333":{"dur":3,"text":"- One of the big challenges\nthat you have as an arena"},"337":{"dur":4,"text":"club is oftentimes, it's\nshared ice so we not only have"},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"our curling ice for\na few nights a week,"},"344":{"dur":3,"text":"but we also share it with hockey\nplayers and figure skaters"},"348":{"dur":3,"text":"and obviously those types of\nthings are hard on the ice"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"to a certain degree, with all\nthe grooves and what have you"},"354":{"dur":2,"text":"and so each night that\nthe curlers come on,"},"357":{"dur":3,"text":"we need to put a heavy flood\ndown and do the pebble,"},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"that makes it nice and flat\nand smooth for the stones"},"363":{"dur":4,"text":"to slide true on, and the\nchallenge of dealing with that"},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"back and forth of arena ice\nis one of the main drives"},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"that inspires a club to\nhave its own facility."},"373":{"dur":3,"text":"And so the next thing that\nwe've done with our finance"},"376":{"dur":3,"text":"and building committees is\nwe're working to raise funds"},"380":{"dur":3,"text":"to put up a new building\nand find the location"},"383":{"dur":3,"text":"and over the years, of\ncourse, we've had our trials"},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"and tribulations, you could\nsay, we were very close"},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"a couple of times to putting\na shovel in the ground"},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"and one thing or another\nbrought those plans to a halt"},"395":{"dur":3,"text":"and so that's been probably\nthe biggest challenge to us,"},"398":{"dur":3,"text":"is getting that final push\ngoing to raise the funds"},"401":{"dur":3,"text":"to get the shovel in the\nground and sometimes,"},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"we've had to even consider\ncomprises on behalf"},"407":{"dur":3,"text":"of maybe not having the\ngreatest curling facility"},"411":{"dur":2,"text":"to start out with, but at\nleast having our own ice"},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"and building from there.\n- It's very true."},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"So what does the future\nhold for the league,"},"418":{"dur":1,"text":"do you guys hope,\nfingers crossed?"},"420":{"dur":4,"text":"- Right now, we're locked\ninto about five hours a week"},"425":{"dur":3,"text":"for curling because the\nvenue here is tight,"},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"with skating and figure\nskating and hockey games,"},"431":{"dur":3,"text":"we can't grow any farther\nthan we are right now"},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"so our alternative is\nthe only way to grow"},"437":{"dur":1,"text":"is to have our own facility."},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"- We've been really\nclose a couple of times"},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"and I think we're just right\non the verge of that big push"},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"of saying, we got over this hump"},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"and now we're gonna have\na shovel in the ground"},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"and we're gonna have\nour own facility."},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"- Well gentlemen, thank\nyou so much for joining us."},"451":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm Laura Kay Prosser,\nproducer of Compass,"},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's it for us and Wilmer,"},"456":{"dur":3,"text":"now we'll head back\nto Les in the studio."},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"(gentle music)"},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"- And with us now to talk\nabout regional amateur sports"},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"efforts in our region,\nwe have Todd Johnson"},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"and Todd is the\nexecutive director"},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"of the Minnesota Amateur\nSports Commission"},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"and we have from the\nMinnesota Curling Association,"},"475":{"dur":1,"text":"we have John Benton."},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"Todd, John, thanks for\njoining us on Compass."},"478":{"dur":1,"text":"- Great to be here.\n- Thanks."},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"- I just think this is a\nterrific subject to talk about"},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"because, a few years ago,\nwho would have thought"},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"that we would have seen a\ncurling club start in Wilmer"},"487":{"dur":4,"text":"and I know that, John, you had\nan amazing history in working"},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"in curling, so why is\ncurling suddenly taking off?"},"495":{"dur":3,"text":"- Well I think, Les, that\nthe Olympics, obviously,"},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"is having a huge impact, the\nexposure that we've gotten"},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"through the last\nthree Olympic cycles,"},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"really is the main reason."},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"The other thing is that\nit's an every man's sport,"},"508":{"dur":1,"text":"it's something that\npeople see and they say,"},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"I could do that."},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"When they come out\nand actually try it,"},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"they realize that maybe we\nmake it look a little easier"},"516":{"dur":3,"text":"than it is, but I really think\nthe fact that you can play"},"520":{"dur":3,"text":"the game for your entire\nlife, just like golf,"},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"it's easily accessible\nand it's affordable,"},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"really really make it\nattractive to people."},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"- And when people see\ncurling on television,"},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"they also see that there's a\nsocial aspect to it as well"},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"because there's a\nfamily friendly aspect"},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"to people watching it,\nstepping aside, watching again,"},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"so there seems to be a\nnice sort of community"},"540":{"dur":1,"text":"atmosphere to it as well."},"541":{"dur":3,"text":"- There is, and that's\na big thing with curling"},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"is that it's a community-\nand a family-based sport,"},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"there's a lot of legacy\nfamilies that participate"},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"in the sport, and it's actually\ntradition after every game"},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"that you go back inside the\nwarm room and you sit down"},"556":{"dur":1,"text":"with the team that you played\nagainst and have a beverage"},"558":{"dur":4,"text":"and talk over the game, so it\nhas that huge social aspect"},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"to it that is really\nattractive to people."},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"- It sounds like a\ngreat idea, and Todd,"},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"I'd like to bring you into the\nconversation because in your"},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"job with the Minnesota\nAmateur Sports Commission,"},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"curling is one of the\nmany things that you have"},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"to have some responsibility\nfor, but in the break there,"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"we were talking about the\nAmateur Sports Commission"},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"is actually statewide,"},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"but also has an economic\ndevelopment piece."},"584":{"dur":1,"text":"- Right, right."},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"Well thank you, first\nof all, for being here"},"587":{"dur":1,"text":"and this is a great opportunity."},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"Not only am I running the\nMinnesota Amateur Sports"},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"Commission, I'm a Ranger so\nI grew up with my parents"},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"curling in the\nHibbing Curling Club,"},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"but then my father moved\nout here and was a school"},"600":{"dur":1,"text":"superintendent in\nDawson and believe me,"},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"when we moved from the\nIron Rings to here,"},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm sure he would have liked\nto continue his curling game,"},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"which they looked\nat as sort bowling."},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, they loved it, it\nwas something my mom and dad"},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"did together, clearly\nnot competitive"},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"as our other friend\nhere at the table,"},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"but the Minnesota\nAmateur Sports Commission"},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"really was the vision of\nGovernor Rudy Perpich in 1987"},"626":{"dur":3,"text":"and what he saw was the\nopportunity to use sport"},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"as an economic development tool"},"632":{"dur":4,"text":"and at that time, he started\nputting together ways to do"},"638":{"dur":4,"text":"the infrastructure to make\na bid for 1996 Olympics."},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"And most people don't realize,\nbut Minnesota missed out"},"645":{"dur":3,"text":"by three votes to\nAtlanta for those games."},"648":{"dur":3,"text":"So that is what I oversee\nas well up in Blaine"},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"as some of those buildings\nthat were constructed"},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"at the time for that\npurpose, but the real mission"},"657":{"dur":3,"text":"is to give Minnesotans\nopportunity for sport"},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"but also to create\neconomic development."},"664":{"dur":1,"text":"- And I expect, because most\npeople look at amateur sports"},"666":{"dur":1,"text":"in their own community,\nthey're often not aware, Todd,"},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"of how many other\nplaces there are."},"670":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, Marshall has\na new hockey arena,"},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"we're talking about curling\nin Wilmer, so I mean,"},"674":{"dur":1,"text":"we're talking about\nregional facilities"},"676":{"dur":1,"text":"over the last 25 years,\nall over the state."},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yeah, the board, the Minnesota\nAmateur Sports Commission"},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"is a statewide board\nappointed by the governor"},"683":{"dur":4,"text":"and the legislature with a\nreal blueprint for creating"},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"epicenters of sport\nthroughout the state."},"690":{"dur":3,"text":"You just mentioned Marshall,\nwe don't run those facilities"},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"as the Amateur Sports\nCommission, but\nwe help facilitate"},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"the bonding so\nthey can get built."},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"- And I suppose what you've\nseen in your sport, John,"},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"is as people get together\nand they go to tournaments,"},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"wherever they go, they're\nspending money, of course,"},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"on hotels and meals\nand activities,"},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"but I think what's\ninteresting to watch in this"},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"is it's also very much often\nabout families and we talk"},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"about how families can\ncome together in your sport"},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"and many others, it's a lot\nabout families, isn't it?"},"718":{"dur":3,"text":"- It is, and you talk a\nlittle bit about traveling"},"721":{"dur":3,"text":"and hotels and economic\nimpact, whether it's a hockey"},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"tournament or a curling\nbond spiel, as we call it,"},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"typically, especially\nwhen the kids go out,"},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"it's not just the kids,\nobviously, it's the families,"},"733":{"dur":3,"text":"it's friends, to go watch,\nand they're all spending"},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"the money at the hotels\nand at restaurants"},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"in whatever community\nthat they're in"},"741":{"dur":3,"text":"and I don't think we really\ntalk about that enough,"},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"we see a lot of results and\nwe talk about the accolades"},"747":{"dur":3,"text":"of the athletes but it really\nmeans a lot to communities"},"751":{"dur":4,"text":"to invest in projects that will\ndraw those kinds of events,"},"756":{"dur":1,"text":"whether it's curling\nor any other sport"},"758":{"dur":3,"text":"because really all of these\nsports do involve family"},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"and to me, that's how\nyou continue the growth"},"766":{"dur":3,"text":"in these sports and thereby\ncreate more economic development"},"769":{"dur":3,"text":"is keeping families\ninvolved in creating"},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"those legacy groups to continue."},"775":{"dur":1,"text":"And no matter where\nI go in the world,"},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"the sport of curling\nis really the same,"},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"it does have that social\naspect and really does have"},"784":{"dur":1,"text":"that family feel to it."},"787":{"dur":3,"text":"You'll very often see parents\nbringing their kids in"},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"to try the sport when they're\nfour or five years old."},"793":{"dur":3,"text":"And the neat thing, just to\ntalk about curling for a second"},"797":{"dur":4,"text":"and what I see great in\ncurling, especially for kids,"},"803":{"dur":2,"text":"is that unlike any other\nsport, when you put kids out"},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"on the ice to curl, they're\nout on the ice for two hours"},"808":{"dur":3,"text":"without any coaching or action,\nso that those social skills"},"812":{"dur":4,"text":"that they need to build\nto relate to their peers"},"816":{"dur":3,"text":"and other people, they really\nget an opportunity to do that"},"820":{"dur":3,"text":"without any sort of\nintervention whatsoever"},"823":{"dur":3,"text":"so it's a fun thing to\nwatch within our sport"},"826":{"dur":2,"text":"and I've been a great\nbenefactor of that."},"829":{"dur":2,"text":"- And of course, Todd, you\ntalked about your family"},"831":{"dur":3,"text":"was in curling and had many\ndifferent, but with your job"},"834":{"dur":3,"text":"right now, you're seeing some\nchanges in sports as well,"},"838":{"dur":1,"text":"a lot more interested\nin not only curling"},"839":{"dur":3,"text":"but individual sports as well,\nright, at the state level?"},"843":{"dur":3,"text":"- It's pretty incredible,\nstate and national level,"},"846":{"dur":2,"text":"the research showing that\nthe fastest growth in sport"},"848":{"dur":3,"text":"right now are individual\nand non-traditional sports."},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"- Such as?\n- Well literally fitness"},"855":{"dur":1,"text":"is huge, but cycling"},"861":{"dur":1,"text":"and I'm drawing a blank"},"862":{"dur":2,"text":"on a few of the others,\nbut it's really interesting"},"865":{"dur":2,"text":"that that's where\nfolks are gravitating"},"867":{"dur":2,"text":"and the research showing\nsome of that is coming"},"870":{"dur":4,"text":"from pressure and cost, so\nwhere there are activities"},"874":{"dur":2,"text":"and opportunities to\nparticipate in sport,"},"877":{"dur":4,"text":"I think what would be a nice\nanalogy with what's going on"},"881":{"dur":2,"text":"is the growth in skeet\nand trap shooting"},"884":{"dur":4,"text":"that's probably flourishing\nout here, near the refuge,"},"889":{"dur":2,"text":"where I spend some\ntime up there."},"892":{"dur":3,"text":"- High school shooting,\ntrap shooting teams."},"895":{"dur":2,"text":"- It's really taking off."},"897":{"dur":3,"text":"We at the sports center\nwere a founding member"},"901":{"dur":2,"text":"of the first-tee\nprogram for golf."},"903":{"dur":1,"text":"Most people don't realize\nthat we actually have a golf"},"905":{"dur":3,"text":"course at Blaine, that's the\nPGA tour designed public course"},"909":{"dur":4,"text":"in the state but it is unique\nin that it has six tee boxes."},"913":{"dur":3,"text":"So you can play with your son\nor daughter or grandchild,"},"917":{"dur":4,"text":"they play at 2000 and you\npay at, if you play the tips,"},"921":{"dur":2,"text":"you play from 7000, or if you're\nme, back it up a little bit"},"923":{"dur":2,"text":"to 5000 and then it\nbecomes a wonderful sport"},"926":{"dur":2,"text":"and we're seeing, we had\n10,000 youth rounds of golf"},"929":{"dur":2,"text":"last year and what we try\nto do is to complement that"},"931":{"dur":3,"text":"with team sport, so\nI think we've talked"},"935":{"dur":3,"text":"with a curling club\njust down the street,"},"939":{"dur":2,"text":"you can discuss a little\nbit, it's just astounding,"},"941":{"dur":3,"text":"the growth in this sport,\nI think the club membership"},"944":{"dur":3,"text":"between, is it Eden Prairie,\nand I live in St. Paul"},"948":{"dur":1,"text":"and right down on\nSelby Avenue is one"},"950":{"dur":3,"text":"of the largest curling\nclubs in America."},"954":{"dur":4,"text":"And there is a real interest\nin it and it just seems"},"958":{"dur":2,"text":"that it's our duty as the\nAmateur Sports Commission"},"961":{"dur":2,"text":"to facilitate opportunities."},"964":{"dur":3,"text":"We bring kids from the\ninner-city up to Blaine"},"967":{"dur":2,"text":"to give them chances and one\nof the really neat things,"},"969":{"dur":3,"text":"it doesn't work quite so much\nwith a sport like curling,"},"972":{"dur":2,"text":"but is to give them\nemployment opportunities"},"975":{"dur":3,"text":"through reffing and we\njust sent out 2000 990s"},"982":{"dur":4,"text":"for youth who get leadership\nopportunities through reffing"},"987":{"dur":4,"text":"and coaching and it's a\nreally important thing."},"991":{"dur":2,"text":"- Well and of course it\nsounds like, so some of this"},"993":{"dur":3,"text":"is also about, people may not\nrealize some of the barriers"},"996":{"dur":3,"text":"that are still there for\nfamilies or for low-income kids"},"1000":{"dur":2,"text":"or low-income families,\nthat there are some barriers"},"1003":{"dur":1,"text":"for them to get into sports\nand a lot of what's going on"},"1005":{"dur":2,"text":"I think in the amateur sports\nworld seems to be reducing"},"1007":{"dur":2,"text":"barriers and in some\ncases, shifting emphasis"},"1009":{"dur":2,"text":"to some of these other sports\nlike curling or cycling"},"1011":{"dur":1,"text":"and I'm
