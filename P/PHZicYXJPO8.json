for example."},"34":{"dur":3,"text":"And one of the things I noticed\nin the early days of getting"},"37":{"dur":1,"text":"interested a little\nbit about talent"},"39":{"dur":2,"text":"is I heard about this woman\nthat, after graduating"},"42":{"dur":1,"text":"from college, she\nwent to France."},"44":{"dur":2,"text":"And she lived the Paris--\nthe Parisian

say,"},"131":{"dur":3,"text":"the single most important\nthing for any organization"},"135":{"dur":2,"text":"to survive and thrive\nin the long term,"},"137":{"dur":3,"text":"and that is the ability to\ngenerate and regenerate talent"},"140":{"dur":1,"text":"on a continuous basis."},"141":{"dur":0,"text":"That's what she did."},"142":{"dur":1,"text":"So I found somebody like that."},"144":{"dur":1,"text":"And I said, this\nis kind of cool."},"145":{"dur":1,"text":"Let me see if I can\nfind somebody else."},"146":{"dur":2,"text":"And I decided, let's look at a\ncompletely different industry."},"149":{"dur":2,"text":"And I looked at professional\nfootball-- the NFL."},"152":{"dur":3,"text":"And it turns out that\nwhen you look at the NFL,"},"155":{"dur":3,"text":"there's one head coach that\nhas had an outsized influence"},"159":{"dur":1,"text":"in the development\nof other head coaches"},"161":{"dur":1,"text":"throughout the\nhistory of the NFL."},"162":{"dur":2,"text":"Does anyone know\nwho that might be?"},"164":{"dur":0,"text":"Any guesses?"},"165":{"dur":0,"text":"AUDIENCE: Bill Walsh."},"166":{"dur":0,"text":"SYDNEY FINKELSTEIN:\nBill Walsh, right."},"167":{"dur":1,"text":"Bill Walsh, San Francisco 49ers."},"169":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, one of the nice things\nabout professional football"},"172":{"dur":1,"text":"and sports is a lot of data."},"173":{"dur":1,"text":"So I actually could\nquantify this."},"175":{"dur":3,"text":"And so what I did is I looked\nat all of the Super Bowl head"},"179":{"dur":3,"text":"coaches of the winning\nteam and the losing team,"},"182":{"dur":2,"text":"so the two best head coaches\nin a particular year."},"184":{"dur":2,"text":"And I did a genealogical\nstudy of them."},"187":{"dur":1,"text":"And by that, I mean,\nnot their parents,"},"189":{"dur":1,"text":"but who they worked for."},"190":{"dur":2,"text":"And I created these\ntrees of talent."},"192":{"dur":1,"text":"And when I did\nthat, it turned out"},"194":{"dur":2,"text":"that Bill Walsh was far and\naway ahead of everybody else."},"196":{"dur":1,"text":"Number two, by the\nway-- we're in Boston,"},"198":{"dur":2,"text":"so I can tell you--\nit's Bill Parcells."},"200":{"dur":2,"text":"And the reason is because\nhe has one protege that"},"203":{"dur":1,"text":"is in the Super Bowl\nalmost every year."},"205":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's Bill Belichick."},"208":{"dur":3,"text":"And so actually this past year,\nback in February in the Super"},"211":{"dur":4,"text":"Bowl, the two head coaches\nboth came from the Bill Walsh"},"216":{"dur":1,"text":"tree of talent."},"217":{"dur":3,"text":"This is, by the way,\n10 years after he died"},"220":{"dur":3,"text":"and 20 years after\nhe was a head coach."},"223":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, unbelievable legacy."},"225":{"dur":2,"text":"So I found somebody\nin football, pretty"},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"different from\nhigh-end restaurants."},"230":{"dur":1,"text":"And I thought, OK, this is fun."},"231":{"dur":0,"text":"Let's keep going."},"232":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I decided, let's\nlook at hedge funds."},"234":{"dur":1,"text":"There's no connection here."},"235":{"dur":2,"text":"They're just out of the blue."},"237":{"dur":2,"text":"And hedge funds, turns\nout it's Julian Robertson"},"240":{"dur":1,"text":"from Tiger Management."},"241":{"dur":0,"text":"Some of you who\nknow that industry"},"242":{"dur":1,"text":"might know-- Tiger\nCubs, Tiger Seeds."},"243":{"dur":2,"text":"A tremendous number of\npeople who work for Julian"},"246":{"dur":2,"text":"have become very successful\nin the hedge fund business."},"249":{"dur":2,"text":"And it turns out to be actually\npretty easy to find that."},"251":{"dur":1,"text":"You start talking to people."},"253":{"dur":1,"text":"And everyone keeps\ntelling you the same name."},"255":{"dur":2,"text":"And at some point, you\nrealize you found the guy"},"257":{"dur":1,"text":"or you found the woman."},"259":{"dur":1,"text":"And so I kept going."},"260":{"dur":2,"text":"And I ended up looking\nat Ralph Lauren"},"262":{"dur":1,"text":"in fashion-- American fashion."},"264":{"dur":1,"text":"The people that work\nfor Ralph Lauren-- I"},"266":{"dur":1,"text":"don't know if you\nknow some of them."},"267":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a long, long list--\nVera

films,"},"284":{"dur":1,"text":"actually, for those\nof you who follow"},"286":{"dur":7,"text":"that, Larry Ellison for being\nLarry Ellison-- about 18"},"293":{"dur":2,"text":"in all, 18 really\ndifferent industries."},"295":{"dur":1,"text":"And so it's kind of interesting."},"297":{"dur":1,"text":"Every industry I\nlooked at, I was"},"298":{"dur":3,"text":"able to find the one person\nthat had this outsized ability--"},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"track record-- of\ndeveloping talent."},"304":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's interesting."},"305":{"dur":1,"text":"But that's, you know,\njust interesting."},"307":{"dur":1,"text":"What do you do with that?"},"308":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I started studying\nthem and interviewing them"},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"and interviewing a lot of the\npeople that work for them,"},"312":{"dur":0,"text":"a lot of the proteges."},"313":{"dur":3,"text":"Hundreds of interviews over\nmany years of looking at this."},"317":{"dur":2,"text":"And what I was interested\nin understanding"},"319":{"dur":1,"text":"is, what do they do\nthat's different?"},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"What do these people do that's\ndifferent than other good"},"323":{"dur":1,"text":"bosses or other good leaders?"},"324":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's what I want\nto talk about in the time"},"327":{"dur":4,"text":"that we have this afternoon,\nsome of the highlights of that."},"331":{"dur":1,"text":"So number one, it\nstarts with-- and I"},"333":{"dur":2,"text":"call this a superboss playbook--\nit starts with talent,"},"336":{"dur":1,"text":"finding great talent."},"337":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, what does that mean when it\ncomes to what superbosses did?"},"340":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, they will look for\ntalent in unusual places."},"344":{"dur":3,"text":"Bill Walsh is a good\nexample, actually."},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"One of the major\nreasons why there"},"350":{"dur":3,"text":"are any African American\nhead coaches in the NFL"},"353":{"dur":1,"text":"is because of Bill Walsh."},"354":{"dur":4,"text":"He saw an untapped talent\npool-- ex-NFL players,"},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"very smart, very\ncapable, motivated,"},"362":{"dur":1,"text":"that happened to be\nAfrican American."},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"And he purposely\nlooked for that talent"},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"and created a variety of\ntraining and development"},"368":{"dur":1,"text":"programs for them."},"370":{"dur":1,"text":"And they became\nassistant coaches for him"},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"and moved all the way up\nto becoming a head coach."},"374":{"dur":1,"text":"In that industry\nat that time, that"},"376":{"dur":1,"text":"was an untapped talent pool."},"378":{"dur":5,"text":"Or Jay Chiat, Chiat-Day-- a big\nadvertising agency-- Chiat-Day"},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"is the agency that\ndid the 1984 Apple"},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"ad that's kind of legendary\nduring the Super

and '80s."},"396":{"dur":0,"text":"And that's women."},"397":{"dur":0,"text":"And he saw that, too."},"398":{"dur":1,"text":"And he said, this is an\nuntapped talent pool."},"399":{"dur":0,"text":"That's nuts."},"400":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's go purposely\nseek out women that"},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"have the potential, the talent."},"404":{"dur":4,"text":"And let's fast-track them\ninto bigger opportunities."},"409":{"dur":3,"text":"So one of the nice side effects\nof a superboss mindset when"},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"it comes to talent is\nyou get more diversity."},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't know they set out to\nget diversity in and of itself,"},"417":{"dur":0,"text":"but they got it."},"418":{"dur":1,"text":"But they got it."},"419":{"dur":3,"text":"They'll hire people without\na job description, which"},"423":{"dur":2,"text":"traditional HR people,\nthey kind of freak out"},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"a little bit with that."},"427":{"dur":1,"text":"There's a famous story\nabout Ralph Lauren."},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"He's in a restaurant in New York\nwith his family having dinner."},"432":{"dur":1,"text":"And at a

off."},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"That happens sometimes."},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"And Ralph and his family\nare done with dinner."},"449":{"dur":1,"text":"And they get up to leave."},"450":{"dur":1,"text":"But before he leaves,\nhe goes over to her"},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"and he takes his\nbusiness card out."},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"And he gives it to\nher, and he says--"},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"she didn't recognize who he was,\nand he never said his name--"},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"and he says to her, I'd like you\nto come in if you have a chance"},"462":{"dur":0,"text":"tomorrow to the office."},"463":{"dur":1,"text":"I want to offer you a job."},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"And she looks down and\nsays, Ralph

that?"},"472":{"dur":4,"text":"If you have thousands of talent\nspotters, you might be able to."},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"Every single person\nin an organization"},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"should become a talent\nscout, a talent spotter."},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"Wherever you go, the\nantenna should be up."},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"Is this someone that\nhas something special,"},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"some energy, some potential?"},"488":{"dur":1,"text":"It doesn't mean you\nhire them on the spot."},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"But maybe you build the\nbeginning of a relationship."},"492":{"dur":1,"text":"You find out what they're doing."},"493":{"dur":4,"text":"And you look for those\nopportunities-- hiring people"},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"without a job description."},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"What do they look\nfor specifically?"},"504":{"dur":1,"text":"So there are a lot of\ndifferent industries."},"506":{"dur":1,"text":"So the details differ,\nof course, right?"},"507":{"dur":3,"text":"But there were four\ncharacteristics or attributes"},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"that I kept seeing\namong the people that"},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"were getting hired that super\nbosses liked that they ended up"},"516":{"dur":0,"text":"hiring."},"517":{"dur":1,"text":"And those four\nthings were-- number"},"519":{"dur":4,"text":"one is intelligence, extreme\nintelligence ideally-- not"},"524":{"dur":3,"text":"just IQ, could be EQ,\nemotional intelligence,"},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"relationship skills, depends\non what the business is."},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"And some of these people\nare legendary for this."},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"Did you ever hear the story\nabout Larry Ellison about that?"},"535":{"dur":3,"text":"He used to tell his trainers\nand his HR people that"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"were doing interviews,\nmake sure at some point you"},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"ask the candidate, are you\nthe smartest person you know?"},"544":{"dur":1,"text":"So how do you answer that?"},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"If you answer yes,\ninterview continues."},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"If you answer no, who is?"},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"It's Mary, who I worked\nwith for a couple years."},"552":{"dur":1,"text":"And he says, well,\nlet me go find Mary."},"553":{"dur":0,"text":"You can go."},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"The interview's over."},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"Sounds like a Larry\nEllison thing, doesn't it?"},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"But it gives you an idea of\nthe extremes to which they"},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"went-- so intelligence."},"564":{"dur":4,"text":"Creativity-- as you'll see, a\nbig part of what superbosses do"},"568":{"dur":1,"text":"is they enhance and they\nunleash the creativity"},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"of individuals doing\nwhatever it is they're doing."},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"Flexibility-- they\nlike people that"},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"have the aptitude\nand interest to do"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"a lot of different things, that\ncould be moved from one job"},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"to another to take full\nadvantage of their skills,"},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"of their mindset, and of\ntheir fresh look at something."},"585":{"dur":3,"text":"And the fourth thing I kept\nseeing was competitiveness."},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"They love competitive people."},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't know that all four\nof these are originals."},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not like Google\ndoesn't want smart people"},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"and doesn't want\ncompetitive people,"},"595":{"dur":0,"text":"doesn't want creative people."},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"But this is what superbosses\nwere looking for."},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"These are the four\nthings I kept seeing."},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"Anyway, there's a lot more\nI could say about talent."},"603":{"dur":1,"text":"But I'm just going\nto kind of highlight"},"605":{"dur":1,"text":"a few things about\nthe superboss playbook"},"607":{"dur":1,"text":"to give you a bit of a flavor."},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"And, you know, depending on\nwhat you ask me afterwards,"},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"I can go into it in\nmore in more detail."},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"So you have great talent."},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"What's the next thing you do?"},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, you've got\nto energize them."},"617":{"dur":1,"text":"You've got to motivate them."},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"They've got to be\nready for action."},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"And one thing about living\nin a superboss world"},"622":{"dur":0,"text":"is the bar is high."},"623":{"dur":1,"text":"And it keeps getting higher."},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not for everyone."},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"You've got to be willing\nto work hard and be"},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"willing to excel at whatever\nit is you're going to do."},"631":{"dur":1,"text":"They're not soft touches."},"632":{"dur":1,"text":"They're not all the\nsame personality,"},"634":{"dur":1,"text":"but they're not soft touches."},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"They push you, and\nthey push you hard."},"637":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't think that's all\nthat shocking, either."},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"How many people live in a\n24\/7 world these days anyways?"},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"A lot of people work\nreally, really hard."},"644":{"dur":6,"text":"But what superbosses add that\nI found many, many managers up"},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"and down organizations don't\ndo, or don't do very well,"},"653":{"dur":1,"text":"is that they inspire."},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"They really inspire\nthe people that"},"656":{"dur":3,"text":"work for them to feel like\nthere's nothing they can't do."},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"Again, Ralph Lauren used to\nsay to the people in his team,"},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"we are the ones that\nset the standard."},"665":{"dur":1,"text":"People-- everyone\nelse follows us."},"667":{"dur":0,"text":"We don't follow them."},"668":{"dur":1,"text":"And you better believe that."},"669":{"dur":1,"text":"You better be\nauthentic with that."},"670":{"dur":1,"text":"You can't fake a\nthing like that."},"671":{"dur":3,"text":"But that was the message\nhe was communicating."},"675":{"dur":1,"text":"He truly believed it."},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"People that worked for Ralph and\nmany of the other superbosses,"},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"they felt almost like\nthey were the chosen ones,"},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"that they were special\nto have that opportunity."},"684":{"dur":4,"text":"And the one thing-- in\nmany of the interviews,"},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"they said something like, the\none thing I never wanted to do"},"691":{"dur":1,"text":"is let my boss down."},"693":{"dur":3,"text":"I never did wanted to let Tommy\nFrist-- CEO of HCA-- I never"},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"wanted to let him down."},"697":{"dur":1,"text":"So they inspire people."},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"They energize people."},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"And that is a really\nimportant part"},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"of being an effective leader,\nno matter what job you've got."},"707":{"dur":1,"text":"Because you've\ngot to give people"},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"a reason why they need\nto go through brick walls"},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"and do unbelievable things."},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"And some people are\ninternally motivated."},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"But at some point,\npeople burn out also."},"716":{"dur":4,"text":"And that inspiration\npart, if it's genuine,"},"721":{"dur":3,"text":"if it's authentic,\nit's a gigantic factor"},"724":{"dur":1,"text":"that keeps people in\nthe game and makes"},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"them feel like they're really\naccomplishing something,"},"728":{"dur":1,"text":"something special."},"730":{"dur":5,"text":"Related to that is the V\nword, the \"vision\" word."},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"It's absolutely

things"},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"that superbosses do."},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"At the same time as having\nthis expansive vision--"},"808":{"dur":3,"text":"at the same time, they\nunleash the creativity"},"811":{"dur":1,"text":"of the people in\ntheir organizations,"},"813":{"dur":3,"text":"of their team members,\nof their peers."},"816":{"dur":3,"text":"And the reason they do that
