here in our"},"402":{"dur":3,"text":"research arboretum, just\n seeing how it's going to grow."},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"So, yeah we work really\n closely with a lot of

numerous people."},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"Other universities,\n  and we also work"},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"with private individuals,\n   because if they find"},"436":{"dur":2,"text":"something that's

it."},"450":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we work with\n even just homeowners."},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"- What are the things\n that you look for,"},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"when you're thinking\n  about evaluating"},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"a new cultivar or a new species?"},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"- That's a really good question."},"462":{"dur":1,"text":"Again, working\n   with the industry,"},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"thinking about what's going on"},"466":{"dur":4,"text":"with the plantings, because\n  now like with boulevards."},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"We actually are\n  selecting trees that"},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"are more upright, more compact."},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"So that way there's\n  less pruning,"},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"healthier for the tree,\nand also cost savings"},"480":{"dur":1,"text":"for the community,\nbecause then they don't"},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"have to come in and\n  prune them as often."},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"So we look at the\n   situation of what"},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"they're going to be in."},"488":{"dur":1,"text":"Disease and insects\nare a big one, we know,"},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"with emerald ash

common,"},"506":{"dur":1,"text":"and then that's\n   what we look for,"},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"is trees that really\n haven't been trialed,"},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"and see how well\nthey would work."},"513":{"dur":1,"text":"- You mentioned germplasm,"},"514":{"dur":1,"text":"but what do you\n   mean by germplasm?"},"516":{"dur":3,"text":"- So germplasm is just\n the idea of

that the genetic"},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"variety is there,\n   and that allows us"},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"to then make crosses and be able"},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"to either preserve or improve."},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"A good example now is\nwith the Freeman Maples."},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"There's some issues with\nchlorosis, Autumn Blaze,"},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"especially in our

doesn't become"},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"chlorotic in high\n   pH, so then now"},"563":{"dur":1,"text":"we can make the\n   crosses and create"},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"our own Freeman\n  maples that would be"},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"more appropriate for\n  our high-pH soils."},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"- So how many seeds do you start"},"572":{"dur":3,"text":"of a particular species\nto evaluate them?"},"576":{"dur":1,"text":"- As many as we can."},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"Because it's all a number game."},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"Especially for hardiness,\n   if we're looking"},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"for a plant that's\n borderline hardiness,"},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"it's just like us, some\n  people can handle the cold,"},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"some people can't."},"587":{"dur":1,"text":"We're looking for\n  that one individual"},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"that really likes the cold."},"590":{"dur":3,"text":"Then from there, we can\nmove onto other traits."},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"Whether it's flower\n  color, fall color,"},"596":{"dur":1,"text":"something like that\n  but we try to get"},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"as many as we can."},"599":{"dur":1,"text":"Sometimes you're\n   limited, if you're making"},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"your own crosses,\n   you may only have"},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"one to half a dozen seeds."},"605":{"dur":1,"text":"But if we're going\n   out and collecting"},"606":{"dur":1,"text":"into, let's say, a\n   native population,"},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"we'll try to get\n   as much as we can,"},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"and be able to line them out."},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"Because we have a\n   research project"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"now going on with redbud."},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"And so there was\n500 planted out,"},"620":{"dur":1,"text":"1,000 planted out,\n  and then we just try"},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"to then pick out,\n  and we slowly reduce"},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"that population\n   to key individuals"},"626":{"dur":1,"text":"that are showing promise."},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"- I have heard the\nterm, \"tissue

a method of propagation."},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"It's the ability to take\na plant and basically"},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"grow it what's\n  called aseptically,"},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"free of

jell-o."},"653":{"dur":1,"text":"I always tell people\n  it's like jell-o,"},"655":{"dur":1,"text":"it has all the nutrients,\n   everything that"},"656":{"dur":3,"text":"the soil would basically\nbe giving to the plant."},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's just a method\n that we're allowed"},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"to generally upscale\n  the plant number."},"664":{"dur":2,"text":"So most of your plants,\nthe cultivars now"},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"in the nursery trade,\n   whether they're perennials"},"668":{"dur":3,"text":"or woody plants, have\n generally gone through"},"671":{"dur":3,"text":"a tissue culture phase,\njust to get numbers up."},"675":{"dur":3,"text":"- I've also heard that\n there's many trees"},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"that are grafted, what\n does that involve?"},"681":{"dur":3,"text":"- Sure, so grafting\n  is a timeless"},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"method of propagation,\n it's been around"},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"way before the Romans."},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"And so it's just\n   a method of taking"},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"a plant portion\n  off from one plant,"},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"and then you're\nattaching it to another"},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"part of a plant,\n generally a seedling."},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"So, say like with elm."},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"They would grow out\n  seedlings of elm,"},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"and then they would\n take a bud, or a small"},"706":{"dur":4,"text":"stem section, cut open\n   the bark on the seedling,"},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"attach that portion,\n   whether it's a single bud,"},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"or a small stem, attach that in"},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"at the right time of\n the year, protect it,"},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"and then eventually the\ntwo callus together,"},"720":{"dur":2,"text":"they grow together, and\nthen they become one."},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"And then the top\n   of that seedling,"},"724":{"dur":1,"text":"because it's just\n  a regular seedling,"},"726":{"dur":1,"text":"there's a lot of\n   genetic variation,"},"728":{"dur":1,"text":"we don't know what\n it's going to become,"},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"but basically we're\n  cloning the plant."},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"And then we chop off the\ntop of that seedling,"},"734":{"dur":1,"text":"and then allow that\n  new plant material,"},"736":{"dur":3,"text":"the bud or the stem, to\n  grow up into the new plant."},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"And you'll see that a lot\n   of times on young trees,"},"742":{"dur":1,"text":"where there'll be a\n little bit of a

hand."},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"But then I say, \"How many\n  of you have eaten an apple?\""},"764":{"dur":1,"text":"And then they all\n   raise their hands,"},"765":{"dur":1,"text":"I said, \"Well

have Honeycrisp apple."},"774":{"dur":3,"text":"I wish we did, but\n University of Minnesota does."},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"And so there's\n   one original tree."},"780":{"dur":1,"text":"But all those

here,"},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"but I'm thinking\nin our own yard,"},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"how do you protect\nthese, because we've got"},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"deer that just love\n to munch on our
