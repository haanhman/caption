3.0?"},"56":{"dur":1,"text":"I want to talk about\nscale."},"57":{"dur":1,"text":"That is part of it."},"59":{"dur":5,"text":"Local scale, as Larry said, the area\nthat we are looking at, there are tributaries"},"64":{"dur":2,"text":"to the Missouri\nRiver, then scale that up to the Missouri"},"67":{"dur":3,"text":"River and then to the\nGulf of Mexico, to make some connections between"},"71":{"dur":2,"text":"those."},"73":{"dur":1,"text":"Another\nreason that I wanted to call it Farmville"},"75":{"dur":3,"text":"3.0, is that\nconservation programs in the United States"},"78":{"dur":5,"text":"are not really new,\nbut issues around then remain, and there has"},"84":{"dur":4,"text":"been sort of\nhistorically, three main agricultural conservation"},"88":{"dur":3,"text":"programs in\nthe United States and they have often come"},"92":{"dur":3,"text":"about in response to\nenvironmental disasters such as the Dust Bowl"},"96":{"dur":5,"text":"in 1935, or kind of\nrenewed understanding about conservation issues"},"102":{"dur":3,"text":"such as the gulf\nhypoxic zone, which I will talk more in detail"},"105":{"dur":4,"text":"about, which we\nhave come to understand a lot about."},"109":{"dur":4,"text":"These programs are\nincentive based, but we really do not have"},"113":{"dur":2,"text":"a lot of information\nabout how well they work."},"116":{"dur":3,"text":"So the first program was really called a set-aside\nprogram."},"120":{"dur":2,"text":"We\npaid farmers to not grow things like wheat"},"123":{"dur":3,"text":"or corn, and farmers\nbeing astute business people just decided"},"127":{"dur":3,"text":"to grow a different\ncrop, which is not necessarily a very effect"},"130":{"dur":1,"text":"conservation\nmeasure."},"131":{"dur":5,"text":"In 1986, the Conservation Reserve Program,\nwhich is"},"137":{"dur":4,"text":"considered by many to be the most effective\nenvironmental"},"141":{"dur":3,"text":"agricultural program, basically pays farmers\na small amount of"},"144":{"dur":4,"text":"money to not grow crops at all on the most\nerodible land."},"149":{"dur":4,"text":"And\nthat began in 1986 and it ramped up, but in"},"153":{"dur":3,"text":"more recent years as\ngovernment funding has begun to shrink, we"},"157":{"dur":3,"text":"have moved to a\ndifferent kind of program which really began"},"160":{"dur":5,"text":"in the early Bush II\nyears, and that is called Working Lands Conservation,"},"165":{"dur":3,"text":"and that is\nwhere the assumption is that farmers can still"},"169":{"dur":4,"text":"grow crops on the\nland, but we can do certain kinds of conservation"},"173":{"dur":4,"text":"measures that\nactually can improve water quality, but again,"},"178":{"dur":1,"text":"we really do not\nknow."},"179":{"dur":3,"text":"So what we have typically done, is we have\ndetermined the"},"182":{"dur":5,"text":"success of the program based on how much money\nwe spend on it,"},"187":{"dur":5,"text":"and as resources get fewer and fewer, there\nis discussion about"},"192":{"dur":2,"text":"are we effectively spending our money?"},"195":{"dur":4,"text":"So in 2010, the US Department Of Agriculture\nincreased support"},"200":{"dur":3,"text":"for these integrated conservation measures\nand those run the"},"203":{"dur":3,"text":"gamut from many different things\u2014riparian\nbuffer zones, terraces,"},"207":{"dur":3,"text":"so farmers can get some funds to help them\ndo these sorts of"},"211":{"dur":3,"text":"things\u2014tile drains, rotational grazing,\nthere are all kinds of"},"214":{"dur":1,"text":"things."},"215":{"dur":3,"text":"No-till lagoon crops, tillage radishes\u2014so\nthis money was"},"219":{"dur":3,"text":"earmarked for certain watersheds, such as\nthe Grand River and"},"222":{"dur":5,"text":"other basins in the Missouri and Mississippi\nthat were known to"},"227":{"dur":6,"text":"provide a lot of nutrients, ultimately to\nthe gulf of Mexico."},"233":{"dur":4,"text":"So integrated farming practices on the land,\nif you were to drive"},"238":{"dur":3,"text":"past them, it may be a little difficult to\nsee, but here are some"},"241":{"dur":3,"text":"terraces here, there are some tile drains\nthat, from an aerial"},"245":{"dur":3,"text":"photo, you cannot really discern what these\nmight be, and there"},"248":{"dur":3,"text":"is not actually a Farmville, but there is\nactually a"},"252":{"dur":3,"text":"Farmersville, in the study area."},"255":{"dur":7,"text":"Things like waste lagoons that\nhelp alleviate issues with manure management,"},"263":{"dur":3,"text":"all of these things\nfall under the province of integrated farming"},"266":{"dur":2,"text":"practices."},"269":{"dur":2,"text":"And\nthe reason that the USDA applied a lot of"},"272":{"dur":4,"text":"money to this program,\nis that goals, in terms of reducing the size"},"277":{"dur":2,"text":"of the gulf hypoxia\nzone were not being met."},"279":{"dur":4,"text":"So here is the goal of the task force\ndown here, this black line, which is 5,000"},"284":{"dur":5,"text":"square kilometers, and\nso some of this can naturally occur, and I"},"289":{"dur":4,"text":"will talk about how\nthat happens, but we are not, under very few"},"294":{"dur":1,"text":"circumstances, we\nare meeting this goal."},"295":{"dur":5,"text":"In fact, the five year average is almost\nthree times that goal, so we need to do something"},"301":{"dur":3,"text":"about that, and\nI will explain why we need to do that."},"304":{"dur":5,"text":"Here is a little cartoon\nof hypoxia and it is also similar to eutrophication."},"310":{"dur":4,"text":"So really what happens is nutrients, either\nin the form of runoff"},"315":{"dur":4,"text":"from agricultural fields or from waste water\ntreatment plants or"},"319":{"dur":7,"text":"urban lands, are delivered into some kind\nof river or water body,"},"326":{"dur":4,"text":"then energy in the form of sunlight, allows\nalgae to grow in"},"331":{"dur":3,"text":"these water bodies, and what can happen is,\nif there is enough"},"334":{"dur":3,"text":"energy and excessive nutrients, then this\nalgal growth can get"},"338":{"dur":6,"text":"pretty far, and eventually, it blocks the\nsunlight at depth and"},"344":{"dur":4,"text":"the algae that grows here, this algal matter,\nbegins to die and"},"349":{"dur":3,"text":"sink to the bottom and when it does, bacteria\nbegins to decompose"},"353":{"dur":4,"text":"it, and it consumes all the oxygen, which\nthe fish and other"},"357":{"dur":2,"text":"organisms need to survive."},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you cannot move away from this\nzone, you are going to die."},"363":{"dur":4,"text":"Some things can move away from that\nzone, but some of the lower critters in the"},"368":{"dur":6,"text":"food chain, which\nsupport the other food chain, perish."},"374":{"dur":5,"text":"And the hypoxic zone is sort of a seasonal\nphenomenon."},"380":{"dur":5,"text":"This is\nan image from 2008."},"386":{"dur":5,"text":"So in the summertime, all this red here is\ndissolved oxygen levels that are below 2 milligrams"},"391":{"dur":3,"text":"per liter, so\nwe have a large area, and 2 milligrams per"},"394":{"dur":2,"text":"liter, will not\nsustain aquatic life."},"397":{"dur":5,"text":"So we have a large area of really depleted\noxygen that is sometimes referred to as the"},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"dead zone."},"404":{"dur":2,"text":"In the\nsummer time, and this is also the time when"},"407":{"dur":4,"text":"most nutrients are\ntransported either through runoff into the"},"411":{"dur":3,"text":"Gulf of Mexico, and it\nis also a time when a lot of energy through"},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"sunlight, is being\ntransmitted into the system, so in the fall"},"417":{"dur":5,"text":"when the temperatures\ncool down and there is less mobility of nutrients,"},"423":{"dur":4,"text":"the system can\nkind of revert and sort of rectify itself,"},"427":{"dur":5,"text":"but this happens\nbasically every year, and it is not just a"},"432":{"dur":3,"text":"phenomenon that is\nonly to the Gulf of Mexico."},"436":{"dur":6,"text":"In fact, it is occurring throughout\nthe coastal areas of the United States, in"},"442":{"dur":3,"text":"Europe, actually all\nthroughout the world, and so it is problem,"},"445":{"dur":3,"text":"not just for us, but\nfor other areas as well."},"449":{"dur":1,"text":"And what does it look like?"},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"This is what I call the \u201cfaces of\nhypoxia\u201d."},"453":{"dur":3,"text":"This is a red tide in California, this is\na large fish"},"457":{"dur":3,"text":"kill from an area where the fish could not\nmove away from this"},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"dead zone."},"463":{"dur":3,"text":"There are some incredible algal mats."},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"This is a\ndrinking water reservoir and they have erected"},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"a barrier to try\nto keep this algae from going into the drinking"},"471":{"dur":5,"text":"water reservoir,\nbecause the algae can affect taste and odor"},"477":{"dur":5,"text":"issues of water\nduring the water treatment process."},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"And then here is a picture that was taken\nin \u201cFarmville\u201d as I"},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"call it, in late summer, and you can see,\nthere are floating"},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"algal mats all along the top."},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"This is closer to home."},"491":{"dur":1,"text":"This is\nin Kansas City."},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the lower end of Brush Creek."},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"And this\nis showing that almost the entire stream is"},"497":{"dur":5,"text":"choked with either\nmacrophytic algae that grows along the shore,"},"503":{"dur":6,"text":"or floating algae\nand that is because there has not been enough"},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"precipitation to\nsort of flush through the system."},"512":{"dur":4,"text":"In Indianapolis, they have\nthese special kinds of farming devices that"},"516":{"dur":5,"text":"actually have to go\nin\u2014the streams are so full of nutrients,"},"522":{"dur":3,"text":"basically every day, to\nfarm these floating algal mats, to keep this"},"525":{"dur":3,"text":"stream, which\nprovides drinking water to the city of Indianapolis"},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"from being\ncompletely choked and stopping the flow of"},"532":{"dur":1,"text":"water."},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"So, there are\ncosts associated with that, not just true"},"536":{"dur":4,"text":"monetary costs, but\nthere are also environmental costs."},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"And here is another way that we scientists\nlike to look at"},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"things, are these crazy kind of graphs, but\nthis was taken just"},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"over the last 45 days at a stream here in\nKansas City, Indian"},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"Creek, near State Line."},"552":{"dur":5,"text":"So what we are showing here is a system,\nthey are measuring nutrients in the system,"},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"this is the green\nline, every 15 minutes."},"560":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is a system, because of waste\nwater effluent, that gets ample nutrients."},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"There are plenty of\nnutrients in this stream."},"566":{"dur":5,"text":"And here we are measuring energy,\nbasically through water temperature."},"571":{"dur":4,"text":"And so in the wintertime,\nthe temperatures kind of keep things down,"},"576":{"dur":3,"text":"but as soon as spring\narrives and the temperature goes up, our energy"},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"is put into the\nsystem, what you can see is a response in"},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"the dissolved oxygen."},"584":{"dur":3,"text":"So some of these ups and downs here, are just\nrelated to the"},"588":{"dur":3,"text":"solubility of oxygen\u2019s temperature changes."},"591":{"dur":5,"text":"You can see, as\nenergy goes into the system and the dissolved"},"596":{"dur":3,"text":"oxygen pretty\nquickly declines to the threshold, this is"},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"not a chronic\nthreshold, but more of an acute threshold,"},"603":{"dur":1,"text":"for aquatic life."},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"It\nis touching on this 5 milligrams per liter"},"607":{"dur":1,"text":"line."},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"And then we\nhave a small runoff event that actually brings"},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"some oxygen back\ninto the system and sort of rectifies it,"},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"then it cooled off."},"615":{"dur":5,"text":"And if I were to extend this graph into today\nand into the week,"},"621":{"dur":4,"text":"it would probably begin again, to come down\nhere again."},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"One of\nthe things that happens, is this time of year,"},"628":{"dur":3,"text":"there are usually\nample nutrients, there is ample energy, but"},"631":{"dur":3,"text":"there are not\npredators that are actually grazing on the"},"634":{"dur":3,"text":"periphyton, so this\ncan be some of the most productive times for"},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"streams, in terms of\nnutrients."},"641":{"dur":3,"text":"So, as Larry said, tributaries matter."},"645":{"dur":5,"text":"So we looked at the Grand\nRiver basin in Northern Missouri, and again,"},"650":{"dur":4,"text":"because resources\nare limited now, we had to rely on an existing"},"654":{"dur":4,"text":"network of other\nstream gauges and long-term record to help"},"659":{"dur":3,"text":"us make sense of what\nwas happening in this basin, so we put some"},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"gauges here, and we\nhad to rely on these other things, and were"},"665":{"dur":5,"text":"thankful we had them,\nin order to look at what was happening."},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"So the objectives, and I am only going to\ntalk about two for the"},"673":{"dur":4,"text":"study, were to characterize concentrations\nand loads of nutrients"},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"for streams within the lower Grand River basin\nand how much of"},"680":{"dur":4,"text":"those nutrients are exported from the basin,\nultimately to the"},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"Missouri River and onto the Gulf of Mexico."},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"Because what we\nknow, is once it goes into the Missouri River,"},"690":{"dur":3,"text":"the processes that\nwould sort of remove the nutrients generally"},"693":{"dur":1,"text":"are not there."},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"Some\nof it can happen, but in general, most of"},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"the time, it just keeps\ngoing."},"699":{"dur":3,"text":"And to evaluate the water quality its historical\ncontext."},"702":{"dur":5,"text":"So, I am going to give you the lessons right\nnow, and after"},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"that, if you want to refresh your beers, you\ncan do that."},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"So we\nhave a good understanding of nutrient dynamics"},"713":{"dur":1,"text":"in the basin."},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"We\nunderstand seasonal annual patterns."},"717":{"dur":3,"text":"We have a better\nunderstanding of potential sources, and we"},"721":{"dur":4,"text":"understand\nimplementation of the integrative practices"},"725":{"dur":3,"text":"within the context of\nlong-term patterns and how those patterns"},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"might vary with time."},"732":{"dur":1,"text":"So how did we do it?"},"733":{"dur":3,"text":"We did monthly sampling plus spring runoff."},"736":{"dur":4,"text":"I am going to talk about the first 44 months\nof the study."},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"We\nsampled for flow nutrients, and I am not going"},"742":{"dur":4,"text":"to talk about\nthese other things that we also sampled for."},"747":{"dur":4,"text":"And so the progress\nto date, is really, we have daily, monthly"},"751":{"dur":3,"text":"and annual estimates\nof nutrients, and by that, I mean nitrogen"},"755":{"dur":3,"text":"and phosphorous in the\nsystem, and we have instantaneous and daily"},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"stream flow, and I am\ngoing to not go into great detail, but I am"},"762":{"dur":5,"text":"going to talk about a\ncouple of models that really help us understand,"},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"give us better\nunderstanding of the system."},"769":{"dur":3,"text":"And so all the models, we are\ncollecting data in the field, and those go"},"773":{"dur":3,"text":"into feeding these\nmodels and what that allows us to do, is it"},"776":{"dur":5,"text":"is just too expensive\nto sample every day, it allows us to extend"},"781":{"dur":4,"text":"our understanding of\nthe system, and this research should be published"},"786":{"dur":4,"text":"soon in River\nResearch and Applications."},"790":{"dur":3,"text":"So it is important to know that the study\narea in much of the"},"794":{"dur":3,"text":"United States, was in drought during the first\npart of the study."},"797":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is the US Drought Monitor in the yellow."},"800":{"dur":3,"text":"The red is the\ndriest part, so we are looking this area up"},"804":{"dur":1,"text":"here."},"805":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is\nOctober of each year, so it was definitely"},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"a dry period, at least\nfor parts of the year, so that is one way"},"810":{"dur":1,"text":"to look at it."},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"And\nhere is a more, sort of \u201cgeeky\u201d way to"},"814":{"dur":1,"text":"look at it."},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the\nlong-term precipitation."},"818":{"dur":4,"text":"This is cumulative precipitation for\nthe first part of the study."},"822":{"dur":3,"text":"So this blue line is how much\nprecipitation we would expect, based on a"},"826":{"dur":5,"text":"number of precipitation\nstations in the area, and this is the precip"},"831":{"dur":2,"text":"at all the stations\nin the basins."},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"So these are all below that patter."},"837":{"dur":2,"text":"So another important thing to note is that\ncertain times of the"},"839":{"dur":3,"text":"year, primarily February through June of each\nyear, the"},"843":{"dur":3,"text":"precipitation was either near normal, or in\nsome cases in 2013,"},"846":{"dur":2,"text":"we had a very wet spring, much above normal."},"848":{"dur":4,"text":"So you can be in a\ndrought and still have these wet periods."},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"And now I am going to talk about this model,\nthis weighted"},"855":{"dur":7,"text":"regressions against time, discharge and season,\nso this graph is"},"863":{"dur":5,"text":"output that shows that we can calibrate the\nmodel using the data"},"869":{"dur":1,"text":"that we have."},"870":{"dur":3,"text":"So this model requires 20 years of data and\n200"},"873":{"dur":3,"text":"data points, which is something we do not\nalways have."},"877":{"dur":3,"text":"But by\ndoing that, it allows us importantly, to remove"},"880":{"dur":3,"text":"year-to-year\nhydrologic variations, but still look at the"},"884":{"dur":5,"text":"seasonal variations,\nand we can compute concentrations and flux"},"889":{"dur":2,"text":"of the amount that\ncomes out of the system for every day in the"},"892":{"dur":2,"text":"record, and we can\nadjust for flow, which is really important"},"895":{"dur":4,"text":"if we are trying to\nlook at system changes, because we know that"},"899":{"dur":3,"text":"hydrology, the\namount of runoff, makes a huge difference."},"903":{"dur":1,"text":"And here is some other output."},"904":{"dur":1,"text":"This is for the Grand River."},"905":{"dur":2,"text":"This is total phosphorous."},"907":{"dur":1,"text":"So we can look at this."},"908":{"dur":2,"text":"It is easy\nto see that if we look at it, this is discharge,"},"911":{"dur":2,"text":"increasing in\nthis direction, and this is concentration,"},"914":{"dur":2,"text":"so it is easy to see\nthat there is definitely a relationship between"},"917":{"dur":3,"text":"concentration and\ndischarge, so it is very easy to see, and"},"920":{"dur":2,"text":"this is showing that\nthere is a seasonal component, like it is"},"922":{"dur":3,"text":"increasing in the\nspring and summer."},"926":{"dur":4,"text":"These plots show that the days that we\nsampled are very consistent with the days"},"930":{"dur":2,"text":"of the record, which is\nimportant for modeling."},"933":{"dur":3,"text":"But here, this shows the concentration\nby year, and it is a little more difficult"},"936":{"dur":1,"text":"to determine if there\nis really a pattern there."},"938":{"dur":4,"text":"So what we are really trying to do,\nis eke out a trend."},"942":{"dur":3,"text":"Our concentrations are increasing or\ndecreasing over this time frame."},"946":{"dur":3,"text":"And we know that streams are\nfundamentally dynamic systems, which is, I"},"950":{"dur":3,"text":"think, why we love\nthem so much, but it also makes them difficult"},"953":{"dur":1,"text":"to study."},"955":{"dur":3,"text":"This\ntool really helps us get a great understanding"},"958":{"dur":2,"text":"of what is going\non."},"961":{"dur":2,"text":"If we look at\u2014this is the Grand River again\u2014this\nis phosphorous."},"964":{"dur":3,"text":"So this line is what is called a flow normalize,\nso now we are"},"967":{"dur":1,"text":"taking out the effects of flow."},"969":{"dur":1,"text":"So we have two things here."},"970":{"dur":2,"text":"The\nred dots are non-flow adjusted and this is"},"973":{"dur":1,"text":"the flow-adjusted."},"974":{"dur":3,"text":"This is concentration up here, and this is\nflux, or the amount"},"977":{"dur":1,"text":"that is exported."},"978":{"dur":6,"text":"So both of these are showing an increase over\nthis time frame of 1991 to 2013, but if we"},"985":{"dur":2,"text":"could find out what is\nreally happening, it would be very useful."},"987":{"dur":1,"text":"So what is really happening?"},"989":{"dur":3,"text":"So what we can do, is then begin to\nseparate these out by seasons."},"993":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is February through July\nof each year."},"996":{"dur":2,"text":"So now we are looking at just samples that\nwere"},"998":{"dur":3,"text":"collected for discharges below 1240 CFS."},"1002":{"dur":3,"text":"There does not appear,\nthere is not really a pattern there that you"},"1006":{"dur":4,"text":"can see, but if we\nlook at samples collected at flows greater"},"1010":{"dur":5,"text":"than 1240 CFS, now a\npattern looks like it begins to emerge, and"},"1015":{"dur":3,"text":"we can use these\nplots\u2014this is called a contour plot, to"},"1019":{"dur":3,"text":"really help us understand\nwhat is going on."},"1022":{"dur":3,"text":"This is showing, for any given year, over\nthis"},"1025":{"dur":2,"text":"1990 to 2013 time frame."},"1028":{"dur":4,"text":"So for each month, this is showing what\nis happening during the year, and this is"},"1032":{"dur":4,"text":"the low range of flow\non this end here, and this is the high range"},"1037":{"dur":1,"text":"of flow."},"1039":{"dur":3,"text":"So what\nthis is showing is that for most of the year,"},"1042":{"dur":3,"text":"under most flows,\nthere really is not much going on there."},"1045":{"dur":3,"text":"There are some\nincreases in some, and decreases in another,"},"1049":{"dur":3,"text":"but the real thing\nthat is happening is under high flows in the"},"1053":{"dur":4,"text":"spring and early\nsummer, there has been a big change in concentrations"},"1058":{"dur":1,"text":"over this\ntime frame."},"1059":{"dur":2,"text":"And there does appear to be a flattening in\nlater"},"1061":{"dur":2,"text":"years."},"1064":{"dur":2,"text":"And we can look at the same thing for total\nin."},"1066":{"dur":2,"text":"This is\nover that same time frame and we see a very"},"1068":{"dur":1,"text":"similar thing."},"1070":{"dur":3,"text":"The\nconcentration changes are really reflected"},"1073":{"dur":4,"text":"over these high flows."},"1077":{"dur":4,"text":"In this case, it is a little earlier than\nthe phosphorous, late"},"1082":{"dur":4,"text":"winter to summer, but we can also break it\napart by decade and"},"1086":{"dur":4,"text":"really find out that most of the changes that\nwe see here, really"},"1090":{"dur":2,"text":"happened in the first ten years."},"1092":{"dur":4,"text":"And since 2002, there is almost\nno change in concentrations."},"1097":{"dur":6,"text":"We have also determined that there\nis a late winter snow melt and storms."},"1103":{"dur":1,"text":"We did not have those this\nyear."},"1104":{"dur":2,"text":"Those can really transport a lot of nutrients\ninto the"},"1107":{"dur":1,"text":"system."},"1109":{"dur":3,"text":"And why would that be the case?"},"1113":{"dur":4,"text":"This plot is showing the total\nnitrogen concentration in the Grand River,"},"1117":{"dur":2,"text":"the average total\nnitrogen concentration."},"1120":{"dur":7,"text":"So it peaks in basically April, and this\nis the excess soil moisture in the ground,"},"1128":{"dur":2,"text":"during the same
