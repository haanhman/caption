health\nindustries we see today."},"142":{"dur":5,"text":"Looks pretty much like\nthe last cottage industry"},"148":{"dur":3,"text":"left in the world."},"151":{"dur":5,"text":"And what we will know,

be"},"202":{"dur":3,"text":"not that different\nfrom bleeding someone"},"205":{"dur":3,"text":"because they have a fever."},"208":{"dur":6,"text":"But the other problem of that\nis the ability of all

have a fantastic\nset of speakers today,"},"319":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's all about\nan agenda that we"},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"care passionately about."},"324":{"dur":4,"text":"It's something that we\ncall People Powered Health."},"328":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, so before we get going\nwith the rest of today,"},"331":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm just going to take just a\nfew moments to tell you firstly"},"334":{"dur":3,"text":"what we mean by People\nPowered Health, our vision."},"338":{"dur":3,"text":"And, then, secondly how\ntoday is going to work."},"342":{"dur":1,"text":"So People Powered Health."},"343":{"dur":4,"text":"The language is simple, but\nthe agenda is ambitious."},"348":{"dur":3,"text":"It's all about putting people at\nthe centre of their own health."},"352":{"dur":3,"text":"In control, knowing how to\nmanage better day-to-day,"},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"and having the\nconfidence to do so."},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"It's about being connected\nto other people who"},"360":{"dur":4,"text":"can support you and working\nin partnership with clinicians"},"365":{"dur":1,"text":"and with professionals."},"367":{"dur":3,"text":"So, that's our starting point."},"370":{"dur":3,"text":"But People Powered Health\nis also about professionals."},"374":{"dur":3,"text":"Professionals, and particularly\nfront-line workers,"},"378":{"dur":3,"text":"just like patients\ncan feel done to."},"381":{"dur":2,"text":"They can feel voiceless."},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"They can feel disconnected\nfrom the purpose, which"},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"brought them into health\nand care in the first place."},"389":{"dur":4,"text":"So People Powered Health is also\nabout empowering professionals."},"394":{"dur":4,"text":"And overall, if you like, it's\nabout humanising our approach"},"398":{"dur":1,"text":"to health."},"400":{"dur":1,"text":"And, so, we have\nsome themes that"},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"are very important to\nour work, all of which"},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"are deeply social in nature."},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"Firstly, we're interested\nin relationships,"},"410":{"dur":3,"text":"whether that's the relationship\nbetween me and my doctor,"},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"relationships between\nprofessionals,"},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"or relationships\nbetween citizens."},"417":{"dur":1,"text":"We think all of\nthose relationships"},"419":{"dur":4,"text":"need to be as collaborative\nas possible with each player"},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"an equal partner valued\nfor their knowledge"},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"and their experience."},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"A second theme for\nus is networks,"},"431":{"dur":3,"text":"and we think much more could\nbe done to intentionally build"},"435":{"dur":3,"text":"social networks that\nhelp to create health."},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"And, again, that\nequally important"},"441":{"dur":1,"text":"if you're living with\nhealth conditions,"},"443":{"dur":3,"text":"and you want to be connected\nand get emotional and practical"},"446":{"dur":3,"text":"support from somebody who really\nunderstands what it's like."},"450":{"dur":1,"text":"But networks are also\nimportant if you're"},"452":{"dur":3,"text":"a professional needing\nsupport from your colleagues"},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"in a highly-stressed system."},"457":{"dur":1,"text":"We have a session\nlater this afternoon"},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"on peer support and\nbehavioural insights,"},"462":{"dur":4,"text":"where we'll be exploring\nthose issues in more depth."},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"And a third theme\nfor us is movements."},"468":{"dur":3,"text":"Social movements, the\nidea of mass mobilisation"},"471":{"dur":1,"text":"to create health."},"472":{"dur":3,"text":"But for all of those social\ndimensions of health,"},"476":{"dur":4,"text":"all of those relationships,\nin order for them"},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"to reach their full\npotential, they"},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"need to be underpinned\nby knowledge."},"486":{"dur":3,"text":"So threaded throughout our\nvision for People Powered"},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"Health is the use\nof technologies"},"492":{"dur":4,"text":"to radically enhance the\ncreation and the use of health"},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"data and knowledge."},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"We think digital\ntechnologies, in particular,"},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"will be essential to\ntransforming health"},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"by generating new\nsources of data"},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"and by turning that data into\nknowledge that can be accessed"},"508":{"dur":3,"text":"and used live and in real time."},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"We have a great digital\nhealth session after lunch,"},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"where several pioneers\nof digital health"},"517":{"dur":3,"text":"will be taking us through\nthe opportunity for citizens"},"520":{"dur":3,"text":"to be in control,\ngenerating their own data."},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"Useful for them\nday-to-day, but also"},"525":{"dur":3,"text":"useful to the wider\ncommunity through research."},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"And, so, it's time combination\nof these two things,"},"531":{"dur":3,"text":"of social innovation and of\ndigital innovation, which we"},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"think is particularly exciting."},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's why we\ntalk about the vision"},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"of a people-powered and a\nknowledge-powered health"},"542":{"dur":1,"text":"system."},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"And today is all\nabout the future."},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"And, as you'd expect, Nesta\nas an organisation focused"},"550":{"dur":3,"text":"on innovation, we have\nan optimistic view"},"553":{"dur":1,"text":"of what's possible."},"555":{"dur":4,"text":"We see challenges and problems\nas productive spurs for change."},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"We think there is immense\npotential an opportunity"},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"for creating better\nways of doing things."},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"But this optimism\nis also grounded."},"568":{"dur":1,"text":"It's built in reality."},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"And we engage pragmatically with\nthe everyday and the sometimes"},"574":{"dur":3,"text":"micro changes that are\nrequired to make progress."},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"We know that innovation\ncan't remain broad brush"},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"if it's to achieve anything."},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"And, so, we're also\nreally interested in how"},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"change happens."},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"How innovations can\nflourish at scale."},"591":{"dur":3,"text":"How a series of complimentary,\nbut aligned changes,"},"594":{"dur":3,"text":"can combine and can\ninteract to create"},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"shifts at the system level."},"600":{"dur":1,"text":"And we're engaged\ndirectly in this"},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"through our 100th day\npeople-powered results"},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"work, where\nfront-line workers are"},"607":{"dur":3,"text":"supported to problem\nsolve with the support"},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"of their leadership."},"611":{"dur":4,"text":"And there's a session on\nthat this afternoon, as well."},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"And, as well as system\nchange at the local level,"},"618":{"dur":3,"text":"we're also interested in system\nchange at the macro level."},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"And, in particular,\nhow we can all"},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"evolve our understanding\nof how complex"},"627":{"dur":4,"text":"innovations can scale\nwithin complex systems."},"631":{"dur":3,"text":"I think it's also worth saying\nthat here at Nesta, we know"},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"we don't have all the answers."},"637":{"dur":3,"text":"And we see part evolve role\nin convening, like today,"},"641":{"dur":3,"text":"so that we can begin to solve\nthese issues collectively."},"645":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I hope that gives you a\nsense of our vision for People"},"648":{"dur":1,"text":"Powered Health."},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"And, if that's our\nvision, then what"},"651":{"dur":4,"text":"does Nesta do practically\ntowards that vision?"},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, some of you may know\nNesta primarily as an investor."},"659":{"dur":3,"text":"Some of you may know us best\nthrough our research work."},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"And some of you may know us\nbecause of the practical work"},"665":{"dur":3,"text":"that we do with front-line\nworkers and with innovative"},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"organisations on the ground."},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"We are all of those things."},"673":{"dur":1,"text":"And we've been\nworking to develop"},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"solutions that\nembody People Powered"},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"Health for several years now."},"678":{"dur":3,"text":"But we're also very\naware that this agenda"},"682":{"dur":3,"text":"builds on several\ndecades worth of work."},"685":{"dur":2,"text":"Work that many of you\nhave been involved"},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"with throughout your careers."},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I'm going to give you now\njust a very quick overview"},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"of some specific pieces\nof work that Nesta"},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"has been involved with."},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to start with\nour investments work."},"698":{"dur":4,"text":"So, since 2007, Nesta has\ninvested about 10 million"},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"pounds in early stage medical\ndevice companies and health"},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"technology companies."},"707":{"dur":3,"text":"And, to give you one example,\nin particular, Cellnovo."},"711":{"dur":4,"text":"So, we invested in\nCellnovo 14 years ago now."},"715":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's a mobile diabetes\nmanagement system."},"718":{"dur":3,"text":"So it means that\nsomebody can wear a pump"},"722":{"dur":4,"text":"that's tracks your glucose\nlevels and your activity levels"},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"and inputs those wirelessly\ninto a dashboard, which"},"729":{"dur":3,"text":"is extremely useful when you're\ntrying to track your glucose"},"732":{"dur":1,"text":"hour-by-hour."},"734":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's also\nuseful, for instance"},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"for parents, who might\nwant to have a sense of how"},"737":{"dur":3,"text":"their child's glucose levels are\ndoing while they're at school."},"741":{"dur":3,"text":"Cellnovo floated successfully\non the Paris stock exchange"},"745":{"dur":3,"text":"last year, so it's a real\nsort of story of success."},"748":{"dur":5,"text":"We also have published more than\nsix ageing and health reports"},"754":{"dur":1,"text":"over the past few years."},"755":{"dur":2,"text":"And, again, just to\nhighlight one in particular,"},"758":{"dur":1,"text":"The NHS in 2030 report."},"760":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, you all actually have\na copy of this in your bag."},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"And it gives you a good\nset of a bit more detail,"},"766":{"dur":3,"text":"if you like, below that\nvision of the people-powered"},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"and a knowledge-powered\nsystem that I was just"},"771":{"dur":1,"text":"touching on earlier."},"772":{"dur":1,"text":"So, do take a look."},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"All of work at Nesta\ninvolves partners."},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"We always work in\npartnership, whether that's"},"779":{"dur":3,"text":"to collaborate with partners,\nto co-deliver with them,"},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"and to co-fund alongside them."},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"So, thank you, to\nall of our partners."},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"I know many of you all\nhere in the room today."},"789":{"dur":3,"text":"Thank you for working with\nthis over the past few years."},"793":{"dur":1,"text":"And one particular\npartnership that I"},"794":{"dur":3,"text":"want to bring your attention\nto is the Longitude Prize."},"797":{"dur":5,"text":"So this is being run by Nesta\nwith funding from Innovate UK."},"803":{"dur":4,"text":"In 2014, the UK public voted\nfor the Longitude Prize"},"808":{"dur":3,"text":"to be focused on antibiotics,\nand, in particular,"},"811":{"dur":2,"text":"on the problem of\nantibiotic resistance."},"814":{"dur":3,"text":"So the challenge is\non to find an accurate"},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"and an easy-to-use\ndiagnostic tool that"},"819":{"dur":3,"text":"can determine whether\nantibiotics are needed"},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"and, if so, which ones."},"824":{"dur":1,"text":"We also run other\nchallenges prizes."},"826":{"dur":1,"text":"So, actually, there's\nanother challenge prize"},"828":{"dur":3,"text":"on at the moment focused on\ninclusive technology, which"},"831":{"dur":1,"text":"you may be interested in."},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"And beyond challenge prizes,\nwe also have a wider portfolio"},"837":{"dur":3,"text":"of practical work, where we work\ndirectly with front-line staff"},"840":{"dur":1,"text":"and with innovative\norganisations."},"842":{"dur":2,"text":"And here with just some of the\norganisations that we've been"},"845":{"dur":1,"text":"working with recently."},"847":{"dur":1,"text":"We've provided about\n10 million pounds"},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"worth of financial\nsupport to solutions"},"851":{"dur":3,"text":"that test and scale People\nPowered Health on the ground."},"855":{"dur":3,"text":"And we take a very hands on\napproach to our practical work."},"859":{"dur":3,"text":"So, we don't just look\nfor promising practise,"},"862":{"dur":3,"text":"we actively capacity built and\nmentor all the organisations"},"866":{"dur":1,"text":"that we work with."},"867":{"dur":3,"text":"We also take a very flexible\napproach because we know that"},"870":{"dur":3,"text":"when you're trying innovation\nthat might mean having a go"},"873":{"dur":2,"text":"at something, realising\nit doesn't work,"},"876":{"dur":1,"text":"and needing to do something\nslightly different."},"878":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's built into our\napproach, if you like."},"880":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I hope that gives you\na sense of who Nesta is,"},"883":{"dur":3,"text":"what work we do, and the vision\nthat we have for a People"},"886":{"dur":1,"text":"Powered Health system."},"888":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's turn our\nattention now to today."},"892":{"dur":4,"text":"So the aim of today is to\ninspire and to

today as\ninformal as we can."},"905":{"dur":2,"text":"It'll be a mixture of\nin-depth conversations,"},"907":{"dur":1,"text":"with some high-energy\npresentations"},"909":{"dur":1,"text":"directly
