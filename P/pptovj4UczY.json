up in a really small town in Rhode Island."},"31":{"dur":2,"text":"I went to a pretty average public school"},"33":{"dur":2,"text":"and when I found out I got into Stanford,"},"36":{"dur":1,"text":"they announced it on the loudspeaker"},"38":{"dur":2,"text":"and everyone in the cafeteria got up and cheered."},"41":{"dur":1,"text":"It was that big of a deal"},"43":{"dur":3,"text":"and so as I was preparing to go off to college,"},"47":{"dur":2,"text":"I remember one day my math teacher pulled me aside"},"50":{"dur":1,"text":"and asked me what I

that"},"56":{"dur":2,"text":"\"you should consider engineering.\""},"59":{"dur":1,"text":"I remember that moment."},"60":{"dur":1,"text":"She said that, I've told this story a million times,"},"62":{"dur":1,"text":"but it's so funny because in my head"},"64":{"dur":2,"text":"I pictured an old man driving a train."},"67":{"dur":0,"text":"(audience laughs)"},"68":{"dur":2,"text":"I had no idea what engineering was,"},"70":{"dur":2,"text":"but whatever picture I had in my head"},"72":{"dur":4,"text":"was the least appealing interesting thing to me at all"},"77":{"dur":2,"text":"and I kind of thought she was crazy,"},"79":{"dur":2,"text":"but sure enough, I got to Stanford"},"83":{"dur":3,"text":"and my freshman year, I had no idea what I wanted to study"},"86":{"dur":2,"text":"and so I thought why not try engineering?"},"89":{"dur":2,"text":"So I signed up for EMI 101."},"92":{"dur":3,"text":"I walked into the room and almost just turned right out"},"95":{"dur":3,"text":"and walked out the other way because I looked around"},"99":{"dur":3,"text":"and I saw barely any girls and I thought"},"102":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm not sure if this is really for me,"},"104":{"dur":2,"text":"but luckily I stayed in the class"},"106":{"dur":1,"text":"and I'm really glad that I did"},"108":{"dur":1,"text":"that I learned what engineering was"},"110":{"dur":2,"text":"and we weren't fixing train engines in that class."},"113":{"dur":1,"text":"It was an amazing class because it was really"},"115":{"dur":3,"text":"an introduction to just the way the world works."},"119":{"dur":1,"text":"We learned the simple machines."},"120":{"dur":1,"text":"we learned how to build stuff, how to invent,"},"122":{"dur":1,"text":"how to be problem-solvers."},"124":{"dur":1,"text":"It was incredibly creative and inspiring to me"},"126":{"dur":1,"text":"to think that I could be an inventor"},"127":{"dur":2,"text":"and solve big problems in the world."},"130":{"dur":1,"text":"That was something I was really passionate about"},"131":{"dur":3,"text":"and so I decided I'm gonna study engineering."},"134":{"dur":1,"text":"From that moment on was the first time"},"136":{"dur":2,"text":"in my life I ever got a C."},"138":{"dur":1,"text":"It was the first time in my life"},"140":{"dur":3,"text":"I ever struggled and hoped that I would just pass class."},"143":{"dur":1,"text":"It was the first time in my life"},"145":{"dur":2,"text":"that I really actually challenged myself"},"148":{"dur":2,"text":"and oftentimes in those classes,"},"150":{"dur":3,"text":"I was the only girl in group projects with all guys"},"153":{"dur":1,"text":"and that often felt like they'd look at me"},"155":{"dur":3,"text":"and think, ah, we got stuck with a girl"},"159":{"dur":1,"text":"and I started to feel that way about myself too."},"161":{"dur":2,"text":"I often felt I wasn't good enough or wasn't smart enough."},"164":{"dur":2,"text":"I almost dropped out of the major a million times."},"166":{"dur":3,"text":"I wasn't set up for success from my public school,"},"170":{"dur":1,"text":"not even knowing what engineering was"},"172":{"dur":2,"text":"and looking around and seeing guys in my classes"},"174":{"dur":2,"text":"who had already learned how to program

it."},"182":{"dur":3,"text":"I studied hard, put in the midnight oil"},"187":{"dur":3,"text":"and I ended up graduating and that day"},"191":{"dur":2,"text":"that I graduated in 2005 was actually the year"},"194":{"dur":2,"text":"that Steve Jobs gave the commencement speech,"},"197":{"dur":4,"text":"so I was there and it was the proudest day of my life"},"201":{"dur":2,"text":"because I had done something hard, you know?"},"204":{"dur":1,"text":"I had really tried something hard"},"206":{"dur":1,"text":"and I'd ended up achieving it"},"208":{"dur":1,"text":"and so that feeling that you get"},"209":{"dur":2,"text":"when you actually really apply yourself"},"212":{"dur":2,"text":"and you climb that mountain and you get to the top,"},"215":{"dur":2,"text":"you feel invincible and that was how I felt"},"217":{"dur":3,"text":"and that was kind of the gift that engineering gave to me,"},"220":{"dur":1,"text":"was proving that I could."},"222":{"dur":2,"text":"That was an unbelievable feeling."},"225":{"dur":3,"text":"So years later, I had been searching"},"229":{"dur":2,"text":"ever since that day I graduated to find my passion."},"232":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, that thing that Steve Jobs said,"},"234":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Go out and find your passion.\""},"236":{"dur":1,"text":"I wanted to find that for myself,"},"237":{"dur":1,"text":"but I didn't know what it was"},"238":{"dur":2,"text":"and so I spent about seven years at different jobs"},"241":{"dur":3,"text":"and finally I found it and it happened one day."},"244":{"dur":2,"text":"I had got together with a group of friends"},"246":{"dur":3,"text":"and we had started this tradition called Idea Brunch"},"250":{"dur":2,"text":"where we'd get together and each person"},"252":{"dur":1,"text":"would get up in front of the group"},"254":{"dur":2,"text":"and share their latest hair-brained idea"},"256":{"dur":2,"text":"for an app or a company or whatever."},"258":{"dur":1,"text":"Just one of those things you kind of"},"260":{"dur":2,"text":"muse about when you're driving in the car."},"262":{"dur":3,"text":"Of course, over breakfast and in that session one day,"},"266":{"dur":2,"text":"my friend Christi, who studied engineering"},"269":{"dur":2,"text":"with me here at Stanford got up."},"271":{"dur":1,"text":"She started complaining about how few women"},"272":{"dur":2,"text":"there were in our engineering classes"},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"and she said, \"You know, as a little girl,"},"277":{"dur":1,"text":"\"I got interested in engineering"},"278":{"dur":1,"text":"\"because I grew up playing with"},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"\"my older brother's hand-me-down construction toys,"},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"\"like Legos and Erector Sets and Lincoln Logs"},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"\"and that's what got me interested in engineering.\""},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"I kind of in that moment thought back to my childhood"},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"growing up with me and my little sister."},"293":{"dur":1,"text":"We never played with any toys like that at all"},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"because those were boy's toys"},"297":{"dur":2,"text":"and I remember in my engineering classes,"},"300":{"dur":1,"text":"a lot of the assignments that we did"},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"we built out of construction toys"},"304":{"dur":3,"text":"and I realized that if I had grown up with this stuff,"},"307":{"dur":4,"text":"I might have thought of myself as an engineer far younger"},"312":{"dur":2,"text":"than by the time I was 18 years old"},"314":{"dur":1,"text":"and so it sounds really corny,"},"316":{"dur":3,"text":"but the moment she had this idea at Idea Brunch"},"319":{"dur":3,"text":"of engineering toys for girls was the moment where"},"323":{"dur":3,"text":"it was like the fireworks went off, the lightning bulb."},"327":{"dur":4,"text":"I just knew, oh my god, this is what I was born to do."},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"I knew it instinctively in that moment"},"333":{"dur":3,"text":"and so the very next day I decided I'm gonna go"},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"to the toy store and get a lay of the land here."},"339":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm sure times have changed since Christi and I were kids."},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm sure there's gotta be a lot of toys for girls"},"344":{"dur":2,"text":"that encourage engineering thinking,"},"346":{"dur":4,"text":"so I went to the toy store and this is what I found."},"352":{"dur":1,"text":"I couldn't believe it."},"354":{"dur":1,"text":"The pink aisle."},"355":{"dur":3,"text":"So this was the most disgusting dolls"},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"that look like street corner girls."},"363":{"dur":4,"text":"It was fairies, princesses, tea sets, ironing boards."},"368":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, it was all about domesticity."},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"It's all about the way that you look."},"373":{"dur":3,"text":"Meanwhile in the blue aisle was all of the smart"},"377":{"dur":3,"text":"math and science games, heroes, action figures"},"381":{"dur":3,"text":"and it just felt like this isn't fair."},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"So the thing about the blue aisle was that"},"387":{"dur":3,"text":"it had a lot of toys that helped develop spatial skills."},"391":{"dur":1,"text":"Now this is something as I started to do"},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"research into how would I advantage girls?"},"396":{"dur":1,"text":"How would I give them a leg up,"},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"give them something that might prepare them for engineering?"},"400":{"dur":3,"text":"Spatial skills kept coming up as underdeveloped in girls."},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, interestingly, I also read that spatial skills"},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"are commonly found in kids who grew up"},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"playing with construction toys."},"412":{"dur":1,"text":"Kids who played with construction toys"},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"have better spatial skills."},"415":{"dur":1,"text":"Boys have better spatial skills"},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"because they played with construction toys."},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"So I thought, okay, if I wanna help"},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"develop girls' spatial skills,"},"423":{"dur":2,"text":"maybe if I could get them building with construction toys,"},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"then that might be a way,"},"428":{"dur":3,"text":"but other construction toys had tried this before."},"432":{"dur":3,"text":"The genius approach was let's make them pink"},"436":{"dur":1,"text":"and then girls will play with them."},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, I noticed in the toy store"},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"that these pink construction toys were sitting"},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"in the corner of the aisle with dust all over them"},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"and I thought maybe there's a better way"},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"and so as I started to research,"},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"I spent weeks and weeks observing,"},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"reading every book I could on child development,"},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"begging my friends to let me babysit their kids"},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"and I observed something."},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"I found that if I just gave a girl"},"463":{"dur":3,"text":"a bunch of construction toys, a lot of times"},"467":{"dur":3,"text":"she would play for a little bit and get disinterested."},"471":{"dur":3,"text":"In one of my sessions, I actually asked a bunch of girls,"},"474":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Well, what do you wanna play with?\""},"476":{"dur":0,"text":"And a bunch of them said,"},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Well, we actually wanna read a story."},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"\"We love this new book that we got.\""},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"They ran upstairs and brought a book down"},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"and I remember in that moment thinking, huh."},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"We have all these construction toys on the floor"},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"and then we're sitting here reading this book together"},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"and I noticed that girls really love"},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"stories and narratives and characters"},"495":{"dur":3,"text":"and so I had this kind of genius idea,"},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"which was girls love stories."},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"Why don't I incorporate storytelling with building?"},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"Because a lot of boys tend to take construction toys"},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"and build a big tower and then smash it against the wall,"},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"but girls really liked kind of building"},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"when there was more of a reason why,"},"514":{"dur":1,"text":"sort of a narrative and a context,"},"516":{"dur":1,"text":"so that was my big idea,"},"518":{"dur":3,"text":"was combining storytelling with building."},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is kind of funny."},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"My grandmother was actually a pioneer."},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"She's one of the first female animators"},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"and created Mr. Magoo and so I've always had"},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"this love of cartooning and art"},"536":{"dur":3,"text":"and so my very first prototype of GoldieBlox"},"539":{"dur":1,"text":"wasn't a construction toy at all."},"541":{"dur":3,"text":"I actually drew a sketch of a little girl"},"544":{"dur":2,"text":"who was not a princess, but not a nerd."},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"She was gonna be a builder and in these sketches,"},"550":{"dur":4,"text":"I had Goldie building these elaborate cool machines"},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"and so I started prototyping"},"558":{"dur":1,"text":"kind of what would Goldie build?"},"559":{"dur":1,"text":"What would be some of the machines that she would make?"},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"In this first prototype, I created a belt drive"},"565":{"dur":3,"text":"where Goldie built a machine to help her dog chase his tail."},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is all stuff, I'm going to the hardware store."},"572":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm rummaging through my drawers with thread spools and clay"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"and it was very these ramshackle prototypes,"},"579":{"dur":3,"text":"but it was enough to kind of get my idea out"},"583":{"dur":4,"text":"of a girl character in an associated building set"},"588":{"dur":3,"text":"where kids could kind of build along with Goldie"},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"and once I'd had this prototype,"},"594":{"dur":3,"text":"I was just like, oh my god, this is genius, right?"},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"Nobody has done this, this is genius"},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"and so I came up with this plan, right?"},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"This is my grand master plan"},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"where I've got this original prototype"},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"that I know is just this breakthrough idea"},"610":{"dur":3,"text":"and one day I'm gonna disrupt the pink aisle"},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"in every toy store with this idea."},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"So there wasn't a very straightforward"},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"path to that as I had thought,"},"622":{"dur":3,"text":"but in my talk today what I wanna share with you all"},"626":{"dur":4,"text":"is sort of this sort of circuitous path that I took"},"630":{"dur":3,"text":"from having my kind of first prototype in hand"},"634":{"dur":3,"text":"to actually getting GoldieBlox onto the shelves"},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"of toy stores around the world."},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm gonna start with my first step"},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"and kind of my first sort of lesson learned along the way,"},"647":{"dur":4,"text":"which is at the very beginning having this first prototype,"},"652":{"dur":1,"text":"I had to learn the difference between"},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"being an inventor and being an entrepreneur."},"658":{"dur":3,"text":"So I brought my first prototype to the New York Toy Fair"},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"to get advice from the bigwigs in the toy industry"},"664":{"dur":2,"text":"and very early on, and in my mind,"},"668":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm like this is the best idea ever."},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"Everybody's gonna love this."},"671":{"dur":1,"text":"This is what I heard."},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"It was mainly old white men in suits"},"675":{"dur":3,"text":"who run the toy industry who said, \"You can't fight nature.\""},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"They said, \"Girls wanna play in the pink aisle."},"681":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Girls don't wanna build."},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"\"This idea's never gonna go mainstream.\""},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"So at this point, I had quit my job"},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"and I was going off of my life savings,"},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"so this was not very good news to hear."},"694":{"dur":3,"text":"I was pretty dejected, as you can imagine"},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"and right after the toy fair, I had actually signed up"},"701":{"dur":3,"text":"to go to this social entrepreneurship conference"},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"and to be honest, I wasn't in the mood to go at all."},"708":{"dur":1,"text":"I kind of just wanted to go home"},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"and crawl up in a ball and hide,"},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"but I had already signed up and I'd paid,"},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"so I go to the conference"},"717":{"dur":4,"text":"and it was this conference for social entrepreneurs."},"721":{"dur":3,"text":"There were about 100 people there and the deal was"},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"everybody who was there had to get up"},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"and share their idea in front of the room."},"729":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, I wasn't feeling so great about my idea at that moment"},"733":{"dur":1,"text":"because all of those old toy men"},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"had told me it was a stupid idea,"},"737":{"dur":3,"text":"but I got up anyway to share the idea"},"741":{"dur":3,"text":"and unlike the reception at the toy fair,"},"745":{"dur":1,"text":"all of the young people at this"},"746":{"dur":4,"text":"social entrepreneurship conference, they were inspired."},"751":{"dur":3,"text":"They all got up to their feet and cheered."},"755":{"dur":2,"text":"They formed a line around the building,"},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"all wanting to be a part of it"},"760":{"dur":1,"text":"and there was something that I learned that was"},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"really helpful at that conference and it was this concept"},"764":{"dur":3,"text":"of being an inventor, being an entrepreneur."},"768":{"dur":1,"text":"I learned that being an inventor means"},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"that you sort of hole up alone,"},"772":{"dur":1,"text":"kind of working on your idea,"},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"trying to come up with something"},"776":{"dur":3,"text":"and that's what I'd been doing for the last few months."},"779":{"dur":1,"text":"I'd been kind of alone in my apartment"},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"making those sketches and prototypes"},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"and even though it was my passion,"},"785":{"dur":1,"text":"it was what I knew I wanted to do"},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"with my life, I was lonely."},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"I wasn't having a lot of fun"},"791":{"dur":2,"text":"and I was too afraid to talk to people about my idea"},"794":{"dur":3,"text":"'cause I was afraid that some big toy company might steal it"},"798":{"dur":2,"text":"and so I was just lonely."},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"The moment I went to this social entrepreneurship conference"},"804":{"dur":2,"text":"and I built up the courage to get up and share my idea"},"806":{"dur":3,"text":"without making somebody sign an NDA, which by the way,"},"810":{"dur":2,"text":"I'd even made my mom sign one, I was so paranoid."},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"(audience laughs)"},"815":{"dur":3,"text":"The moment I actually, I'm not even kidding."},"819":{"dur":1,"text":"I have a copy of it."},"820":{"dur":1,"text":"(audience laughs)"},"821":{"dur":1,"text":"The moment I actually finally kind of"},"823":{"dur":3,"text":"put myself out there, everything changed."},"827":{"dur":2,"text":"All of a sudden, I wasn't feeling lonely anymore."},"830":{"dur":3,"text":"I had people coming to my apartment every day."},"834":{"dur":1,"text":"Evenings, weekends."},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"We were working on the prototypes together."},"838":{"dur":2,"text":"They were helping me, they were giving me advice."},"840":{"dur":3,"text":"They were giving me ideas, just volunteering"},"844":{"dur":3,"text":"because they were passionate about it."},"847":{"dur":2,"text":"They helped me kind of take that first"},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"sort of ugly prototype and they helped me"},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"rapidly prototype it again and again and again."},"854":{"dur":1,"text":"They helped me test it with kids."},"856":{"dur":2,"text":"We tested it with over 100 kids"},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"and each time we observed kids playing with it,"},"862":{"dur":2,"text":"we found ways to make it better and better"},"864":{"dur":2,"text":"and so all of a sudden, I went from being"},"867":{"dur":4,"text":"this kind of lone hermit inventor to being an entrepreneur"},"871":{"dur":4,"text":"because the entrepreneur is somebody who shares their vision"},"875":{"dur":3,"text":"and more importantly brings people along"},"878":{"dur":2,"text":"and the moment that those people lined up"},"881":{"dur":2,"text":"to be a part of it and I let them"},"884":{"dur":3,"text":"is the moment that I became an entrepreneur"},"887":{"dur":3,"text":"and so with their help, I went from this"},"890":{"dur":2,"text":"lonely hermit prototype in my living room"},"893":{"dur":2,"text":"to a final toy that girls loved."},"897":{"dur":4,"text":"Girls in tutus and tiaras were building belt drives"},"901":{"dur":3,"text":"and loving it and so I knew I had it,"},"905":{"dur":4,"text":"but the problem was I knew that all of those old people"},"909":{"dur":2,"text":"in the toy industry were never gonna believe me."},"912":{"dur":2,"text":"They all thought that this was never gonna sell"},"914":{"dur":4,"text":"and so I put it up on Kickstarter and before I knew it,"},"919":{"dur":3,"text":"I had sold about $1,000,000 of GoldieBlox"},"922":{"dur":3,"text":"in pre-orders before manufacturing a single unit"},"926":{"dur":3,"text":"and so the amazing thing was that this mission"},"930":{"dur":3,"text":"that I believed in, by being able to sort of"},"933":{"dur":2,"text":"share my vision in a video format"},"936":{"dur":2,"text":"was kind of the same way that I shared my vision"},"939":{"dur":2,"text":"at that conference where I just kind of talked to people"},"941":{"dur":3,"text":"about, \"Hey, here's what I'm doing and here's why.\""},"945":{"dur":3,"text":"I was authentic and I invited people to help"},"949":{"dur":2,"text":"by taking this Kickstarter, backing it"},"951":{"dur":4,"text":"and making it a reality and the concept went viral."},"956":{"dur":2,"text":"All of a sudden, TechCrunch wrote it up,"},"958":{"dur":3,"text":"The Atlantic, Huffington Post, it was all over the news"},"962":{"dur":2,"text":"of can an engineering toy get girls interested?"},"964":{"dur":3,"text":"Can an engineering toy solve the gender gap?"},"969":{"dur":3,"text":"My team of three full-time employees,"},"974":{"dur":1,"text":"this is our packing party"},"976":{"dur":2,"text":"where we started shipping out Kickstarter orders"},"979":{"dur":2,"text":"and these are some of our very first backers"},"981":{"dur":3,"text":"and so it very quickly in my very first year"},"986":{"dur":3,"text":"went from being an inventor to an entrepreneur"},"989":{"dur":3,"text":"and was very proud to go back to that toy fair"},"992":{"dur":4,"text":"with my own booth one year later and sure enough,"},"997":{"dur":3,"text":"who came over to the booth but Toys \"R\" Us?"},"1000":{"dur":3,"text":"They said, \"Hey, you're making us look bad."},"1004":{"dur":2,"text":"\"We'd

nationwide,"},"1013":{"dur":4,"text":"which thank you.\n(audience applauds)"},"1021":{"dur":2,"text":"So which led us to year two"},"1023":{"dur":2,"text":"and the next kind of big lesson learned for me,"},"1026":{"dur":2,"text":"which is how very limited resources"},"1029":{"dur":3,"text":"can actually be a big strategic advantage."},"1032":{"dur":3,"text":"So getting into Toys \"R\" Us

just realized,"},"1053":{"dur":4,"text":"oh my gosh, this toy is one tiny box in a sea of pink"},"1060":{"dur":2,"text":"and how are we gonna compete?"},"1062":{"dur":1,"text":"How are we gonna compete?"},"1064":{"dur":1,"text":"What actually started to happen was"},"1066":{"dur":2,"text":"we started to get our sales results in from Toys \"R\" Us"},"1068":{"dur":2,"text":"and the toys weren't really selling"},"1071":{"dur":2,"text":"and so we had disrupted the pink aisle,"},"1074":{"dur":3,"text":"but we were gonna get kicked out of there any moment"},"1077":{"dur":2,"text":"unless the sales started to pick up"},"1079":{"dur":4,"text":"and so I asked Toys \"R\" Us, \"What do we do, what can we do?"},"1083":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Give us some ideas, we'll do anything."},"1085":{"dur":2,"text":"\"We wanna get the toys to start selling.\""},"1088":{"dur":2,"text":"They said, \"Well, usually our partners"},"1090":{"dur":2,"text":"\"do national TV commercials"},"1093":{"dur":3,"text":"\"and that usually helps get the toys to sell.\""},"1096":{"dur":2,"text":"So those cost about $2,000,000."},"1099":{"dur":2,"text":"That was really not in the cards"},"1101":{"dur":2,"text":"and so we had to get scrappy."},"1103":{"dur":1,"text":"We invited our Kickstarter backers"},"1105":{"dur":2,"text":"to the Toys \"R\" Us parking lot"},"1108":{"dur":2,"text":"and we said, \"Hey, we're gonna film a video together.\""},"1110":{"dur":2,"text":"Our idea was if we wanna tell the world"},"1112":{"dur":2,"text":"that we're in Toys \"R\" Us, let's film a shot of"},"1114":{"dur":3,"text":"a bunch of words running through the pink aisle screaming,"},"1118":{"dur":4,"text":"so we invited our Kickstarter backers to the parking lot."},"1122":{"dur":3,"text":"About 50 people showed up, kids and their parents."},"1125":{"dur":2,"text":"We're getting ready to kind of get this stealth shot"},"1128":{"dur":3,"text":"and then the security guard starts circling."},"1131":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm like, \"Oh my god, we're gonna get arrested.\""},"1134":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughs)"},"1135":{"dur":3,"text":"So the manager of Toys \"R\" Us comes out with this clipboard"},"1139":{"dur":3,"text":"and they say, \"What's going on here?\""},"1142":{"dur":1,"text":"So I told a little white lie."},"1143":{"dur":3,"text":"Said we were the loveliest girls club on a field trip"},"1147":{"dur":2,"text":"to the girls' favorite place in the world, Toys \"R\" Us."},"1149":{"dur":1,"text":"(audience chuckles)\nHe said, \"Oh my

shot,"},"1166":{"dur":4,"text":"posted the video on YouTube and we got about 1,000,000 views"},"1171":{"dur":3,"text":"and the story broke that GoldieBlox broke into Toys \"R\" Us"},"1175":{"dur":2,"text":"and it went viral and all of a sudden"},"1178":{"dur":2,"text":"sales started to pick up"},"1181":{"dur":2,"text":"and so we kept trying to figure out ways,"},"1183":{"dur":2,"text":"like how do we, even though we're this teeny-tiny team,"},"1186":{"dur":3,"text":"we're only five people, how do we get the word out?"},"1189":{"dur":3,"text":"We found out about a contest being run by Intuit"},"1192":{"dur":3,"text":"where one small business had the chance"},"1196":{"dur":2,"text":"to win a free Super Bowl commercial,"},"1198":{"dur":3,"text":"so I'm like, okay, there's our national TV advertising."},"1202":{"dur":3,"text":"We gotta win this and so again, it sounds crazy."},"1205":{"dur":2,"text":"How could we win a Super Bowl commercial?"},"1207":{"dur":3,"text":"We just put it on the wall and we said, \"This is our goal.\""},"1210":{"dur":3,"text":"Our team of five people, every single day"},"1213":{"dur":2,"text":"tried to get creative of how are we gonna win this?"},"1216":{"dur":2,"text":"So we emailed our Kickstarter backers."},"1218":{"dur":2,"text":"We emailed our fans, just begged every day"},"1220":{"dur":1,"text":"vote for us, vote for us, vote for us"},"1222":{"dur":3,"text":"and sure enough, out of 30,000 small businesses who applied,"},"1226":{"dur":2,"text":"GoldieBlox was the grand prize winner"},"1229":{"dur":2,"text":"and so we had a commercial in the Super Bowl,"},"1232":{"dur":2,"text":"which I will play for you."},"1234":{"dur":2,"text":"(upbeat rock music)"},"1237":{"dur":3,"text":"\u266b Come on, get your toys"},"1240":{"dur":2,"text":"\u266b Girls make some noise"},"1242":{"dur":3,"text":"\u266b More than pink, pink,

GoldieBlox"},"1291":{"dur":1,"text":"and our mission to disrupt the pink aisle"},"1293":{"dur":2,"text":"and so all of those old toy guys"},"1296":{"dur":2,"text":"who said it was never gonna go mainstream,"},"1298":{"dur":3,"text":"in that 30 seconds were entirely proved wrong"},"1301":{"dur":3,"text":"and from there just an amazing domino effect happened"},"1305":{"dur":2,"text":"where we got the opportunity to have a float"},"1307":{"dur":2,"text":"in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade."},"1310":{"dur":2,"text":"I got to meet President Obama and be inducted"},"1313":{"dur":3,"text":"as a Presidential Ambassador for Entrepreneurship."},"1316":{"dur":3,"text":"Just doors started flying open left and right for GoldieBlox"},"1320":{"dur":2,"text":"and it was this amazing and exciting time,"},"1323":{"dur":2,"text":"but Houston, we had a problem"},"1326":{"dur":4,"text":"and that was the demand for our toys was growing so fast,"},"1331":{"dur":3,"text":"so fast that our team didn't have time"},"1336":{"dur":2,"text":"to quality check everything as well as we wanted"},"1339":{"dur":2,"text":"and so going into year three,"},"1341":{"dur":2,"text":"GoldieBlox is on top of the world."},"1343":{"dur":3,"text":"Meanwhile, we have a problem with our blocks,"},"1347":{"dur":3,"text":"which leads us to kind of the next lesson learned,"},"1351":{"dur":4,"text":"which is how do you turn failure into an opportunity?"},"1355":{"dur":2,"text":"So my biggest fear in starting GoldieBlox"},"1358":{"dur":4,"text":"is what if the girl construction toy wasn't well-engineered?"},"1363":{"dur":2,"text":"What if we gave a construction toy out"},"1365":{"dur":1,"text":"and little girls got frustrated"},"1367":{"dur":1,"text":"and the opposite effect happened?"},"1369":{"dur":1,"text":"Where instead of getting them interested and excited"},"1371":{"dur":2,"text":"in engineering, they got frustrated."},"1373":{"dur":3,"text":"It was literally my worst nightmare and I was living it,"},"1377":{"dur":4,"text":"so in 2014, Super Bowl commercial, Toys \"R\" Us nationwide"},"1381":{"dur":2,"text":"were shipping tens of thousands of units from something"},"1384":{"dur":2,"text":"that had less than a year before"},"1387":{"dur":2,"text":"been a prototype in my living room."},"1389":{"dur":4,"text":"Anyone who has a hardware company knows this is very common."},"1394":{"dur":4,"text":"You're gonna have problems, but this was just a whole level"},"1398":{"dur":3,"text":"of something I was completely unprepared for."},"1402":{"dur":2,"text":"We started getting complaints in that the blocks"},"1404":{"dur":3,"text":"were not fitting right, a little bit too loose"},"1407":{"dur":4,"text":"and I was just so upset, I could barely handle it,"},"1414":{"dur":3,"text":"so we thought, okay, what would we do?"},"1418":{"dur":2,"text":"What would an engineer do?"},"1421":{"dur":1,"text":"When you have this big hairy problem,"},"1423":{"dur":3,"text":"let's break it down into simple and manageable steps, right?"},"1426":{"dur":1,"text":"So what do we need to do?"},"1427":{"dur":1,"text":"So first we need to fix the block hole."},"1429":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay, can we do that?"},"1430":{"dur":1,"text":"Great, we know how to fix it."},"1432":{"dur":2,"text":"Now we've been able to manufacture better blocks."},"1435":{"dur":2,"text":"The problem is solved, but now how do we go back"},"1438":{"dur":1,"text":"and tell all of those people,"},"1439":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Hey, everybody, we fixed the problem"},"1441":{"dur":1,"text":"\"and you should trust GoldieBlox again."},"1443":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Let's try building again.\""},"1445":{"dur":3,"text":"So I made a pretty major executive decision"},"1449":{"dur":2,"text":"and we were a small startup at the time"},"1452":{"dur":2,"text":"without a lot of resources, but I thought"},"1454":{"dur":2,"text":"there's no better way to deploy our resources"},"1457":{"dur":2,"text":"than going back to all of those customers,"},"1459":{"dur":1,"text":"telling them that we fixed our blocks"},"1461":{"dur":1,"text":"and giving them new ones"},"1463":{"dur":2,"text":"and so we did a huge campaign where we reached out"},"1465":{"dur":3,"text":"to everybody to tell them about our new blocks."},"1468":{"dur":2,"text":"Filmed a video myself kind of being vulnerable"},"1471":{"dur":3,"text":"and talking about the mistake that we had made,"},"1474":{"dur":2,"text":"but what we were doing to fix it"},"1477":{"dur":3,"text":"and we also actually wrote a letter from Goldie"},"1481":{"dur":4,"text":"to each kid, which we had personalized with their name"},"1485":{"dur":3,"text":"talking about how engineers don't always get it right"},"1488":{"dur":2,"text":"the first time, but that doesn't mean that you give up."},"1490":{"dur":1,"text":"It means that you keep going."},"1492":{"dur":2,"text":"You keep iterating and you make it better"},"1494":{"dur":2,"text":"and we actually drew a picture of the engineering solution"},"1497":{"dur":2,"text":"that got the block to fit better"},"1499":{"dur":1,"text":"and we sent it out to every kid."},"1501":{"dur":3,"text":"We actually went and replaced 1,000,000 blocks,"},"1504":{"dur":1,"text":"which was an enormous investment"},"1506":{"dur":1,"text":"and worth every single penny,"},"1508":{"dur":2,"text":"so we turned that failure into an opportunity"},"1511":{"dur":1,"text":"and every person that we touched"},"1513":{"dur":2,"text":"fell in love with our brand even more."},"1516":{"dur":4,"text":"So then I get to my next lesson on my circuitous path,"},"1521":{"dur":4,"text":"which is design for the customer, not the retailer."},"1526":{"dur":2,"text":"So GoldieBlox is flying high"},"1529":{"dur":3,"text":"and every retailer wants to carry it."},"1532":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, the brand is so hot"},"1535":{"dur":2,"text":"and sure enough, Walmart calls"},"1537":{"dur":2,"text":"and Walmart is begging for GoldieBlox."},"1540":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, imagine being in the situation"},"1542":{"dur":2,"text":"where Walmart is begging for your product"},"1544":{"dur":1,"text":"and so in order to sell at Walmart,"},"1546":{"dur":3,"text":"we were told by a lot of the toy industry veterans"},"1550":{"dur":3,"text":"that you have to have products at $9.99."},"1555":{"dur":1,"text":"You have to have low price point products."},"1556":{"dur":3,"text":"That's what sells at Walmart and so our whole focus"},"1560":{"dur":2,"text":"for the year was, okay, we're gonna go big."},"1562":{"dur":2,"text":"GoldieBlox is gonna hit the mainstream"},"1565":{"dur":2,"text":"and everybody drop everything."},"1567":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's figure out how to make toys that are 10 bucks"},"1571":{"dur":1,"text":"and make a lot of them 'cause we have to have"},"1573":{"dur":2,"text":"a lot of products to fill up a lot of room."},"1576":{"dur":3,"text":"So we had a really small team still, about 15 people"},"1579":{"dur":1,"text":"and we were just bending over backwards"},"1581":{"dur":4,"text":"under insane timelines and all we're thinking about"},"1585":{"dur":2,"text":"is hitting that $9.99 price point"},"1588":{"dur":2,"text":"and hitting the shelf date on time."},"1593":{"dur":2,"text":"What ended up happening was we worked"},"1596":{"dur":1,"text":"as hard and as fast as we could."},"1598":{"dur":3,"text":"We went from six products to 18 products"},"1602":{"dur":2,"text":"in less than a year, getting out as many products"},"1605":{"dur":3,"text":"as we could at the cheapest prices that we could"},"1608":{"dur":3,"text":"and as a result, those cheap products"},"1612":{"dur":2,"text":"very quickly went on clearance."},"1615":{"dur":3,"text":"We had kind of forgotten the most important thing,"},"1619":{"dur":3,"text":"which is if GoldieBlox was gonna be successful,"},"1622":{"dur":2,"text":"we have to design for the girls."},"1626":{"dur":2,"text":"Every product, it doesn't matter how much it costs."},"1628":{"dur":2,"text":"If it's not a product that excites"},"1630":{"dur":1,"text":"and gets every girl interested"},"1632":{"dur":3,"text":"in wanting to build more and more, we've failed"},"1636":{"dur":3,"text":"and so by the end of the year, we had gone from"},"1640":{"dur":3,"text":"sort of being on the top of the world to sort of"},"1643":{"dur":4,"text":"hitting this real reality, major major reality check,"},"1649":{"dur":2,"text":"which leads me to my final lesson"},"1653":{"dur":2,"text":"which is never ever give up."},"1656":{"dur":4,"text":"So kind of every startup is a roller coaster, you know?"},"1661":{"dur":1,"text":"At one moment, you're at the top of the world"},"1662":{"dur":2,"text":"and I feel like we at this moment had sort of"},"1665":{"dur":2,"text":"gone right back down to the bottom again"},"1668":{"dur":2,"text":"and so we had to sort of have a soul-searching moment"},"1670":{"dur":2,"text":"of where do we go from here?"},"1673":{"dur":1,"text":"What do we do now?"},"1675":{"dur":3,"text":"So we thought, okay, let's forget about"},"1680":{"dur":1,"text":"designing for the retailer."},"1681":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's forget about the toy aisle."},"1684":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's forget about disrupting the toy aisle."},"1686":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's think about making the best possible products"},"1690":{"dur":2,"text":"that inspires these girls."},"1692":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's think about what have we done so far"},"1695":{"dur":3,"text":"that girls really love and let's lean into that"},"1698":{"dur":1,"text":"and so as we started to look at that"},"1700":{"dur":2,"text":"and think about it more and more,"},"1702":{"dur":3,"text":"we'd realized that in fact what girls were really loving"},"1705":{"dur":3,"text":"about GoldieBlox, they were loving building"},"1709":{"dur":3,"text":"and we were introducing it to them in a new way,"},"1712":{"dur":3,"text":"which was good, but what we noticed they loved the most"},"1716":{"dur":3,"text":"was they loved the idea of this character Goldie."},"1719":{"dur":2,"text":"They were dressing up as her for Halloween."},"1722":{"dur":3,"text":"They were wanting to, they were admiring her"},"1726":{"dur":2,"text":"and every time we had kind of introduced Goldie"},"1728":{"dur":2,"text":"and her friends to them, these characters"},"1731":{"dur":3,"text":"and these stories, that was what was really engaging them"},"1734":{"dur":2,"text":"and that was what was really unique about us."},"1737":{"dur":3,"text":"Tinkertoy doesn't do that and K'NEX doesn't do that."},"1741":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, the construction toys don't do that."},"1742":{"dur":2,"text":"That was something really special about us."},"1744":{"dur":3,"text":"It was really the stories and so we started"},"1749":{"dur":2,"text":"leaning into that more and more and really kind of"},"1751":{"dur":2,"text":"thinking more and more and spending our time"},"1754":{"dur":3,"text":"not focusing on what can we make for $9.99,"},"1757":{"dur":3,"text":"but focusing on how would we create this role model,"},"1761":{"dur":3,"text":"Goldie, to really become a role model of girls?"},"1766":{"dur":3,"text":"To really become kind of an inspiring maker?"},"1770":{"dur":1,"text":"Who is she, you know?"},"1773":{"dur":1,"text":"Who are her parents?"},"1774":{"dur":0,"text":"Who are her friends?"},"1775":{"dur":1,"text":"What town does she live in?"},"1776":{"dur":2,"text":"What kind of things does she build?"},"1778":{"dur":3,"text":"We started writing much richer and deeper stories"},"1781":{"dur":4,"text":"and really started figuring out who is this girl?"},"1786":{"dur":4,"text":"And can we really develop enough story about this character"},"1791":{"dur":2,"text":"that she will be somebody that every girl"},"1793":{"dur":2,"text":"falls in love with and wants to be?"},"1798":{"dur":3,"text":"So we started leaning into that more and more"},"1801":{"dur":3,"text":"and just yesterday, we actually announced"},"1804":{"dur":3,"text":"chapter books with our partner, Random House,"},"1807":{"dur":2,"text":"and so now we'll start to get out"},"1811":{"dur":2,"text":"these really rich stories about this girl"},"1813":{"dur":3,"text":"who believe it or not, is literally the first"},"1818":{"dur":4,"text":"girl engineer protagonist in children's entertainment."},"1823":{"dur":3,"text":"It took until 2012 for somebody to create"},"1827":{"dur":2,"text":"a girl engineer in children's entertainment"},"1829":{"dur":3,"text":"and so now we have chapter books coming out about Goldie."},"1833":{"dur":2,"text":"We started figuring out how do we"},"1835":{"dur":1,"text":"get these stories out more?"},"1837":{"dur":3,"text":"We started just experimenting on YouTube"},"1840":{"dur":2,"text":"and making short videos,"},"1844":{"dur":3,"text":"just as quickly as we could with stories about Goldie."},"1847":{"dur":2,"text":"We took our little toy character"},"1849":{"dur":4,"text":"and we created a web video series called Toy Hackers"},"1854":{"dur":2,"text":"where in each episode, our little toys"},"1857":{"dur":3,"text":"would have to solve engineering problems"},"1861":{"dur":3,"text":"and so they would get a prompt and just using"},"1864":{"dur":2,"text":"common household objects in each episode,"},"1867":{"dur":2,"text":"these little toy figurines"},"1869":{"dur":2,"text":"would build solutions to problems"},"1872":{"dur":2,"text":"and every week we'd put up a new episode"},"1874":{"dur":2,"text":"where we just made them in our office"},"1877":{"dur":1,"text":"and the videos started to climb"},"1879":{"dur":3,"text":"where we would get views and more views and more views"},"1883":{"dur":1,"text":"and our subscribers of kids"},"1884":{"dur":3,"text":"watching the content started to go up."},"1888":{"dur":3,"text":"We started to think, well, how else can we get Goldie,"},"1891":{"dur":2,"text":"this character, out in front of kids"},"1894":{"dur":1,"text":"in a way that we can control it,"},"1896":{"dur":3,"text":"we can own it, and we can do it scrappy?"},"1900":{"dur":2,"text":"We took all of our toy parts"},"1903":{"dur":3,"text":"and we put them into curriculum kits"},"1906":{"dur":2,"text":"where we could get it into the classroom"},"1908":{"dur":3,"text":"and have kind of STEM educational curriculum"},"1912":{"dur":2,"text":"for kindergarten through third grade"},"1914":{"dur":2,"text":"and it sounded really daunting."},"1918":{"dur":1,"text":"How would we now create,"},"1920":{"dur":3,"text":"go into the entire education market?"},"1923":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, all we did was call up our friend"},"1928":{"dur":1,"text":"who was an elementary school teacher"},"1930":{"dur":2,"text":"and ask her if she would help"},"1932":{"dur":3,"text":"and she literally did it in exchange for free toys"},"1936":{"dur":1,"text":"and she called up her other friends"},"1938":{"dur":2,"text":"and before we knew it, we had all of these teachers"},"1940":{"dur":4,"text":"passionately wanting to create GoldieBlox curriculum"},"1944":{"dur":3,"text":"for students and coming by the office every day"},"1949":{"dur":3,"text":"and putting stuff together, going out into classrooms,"},"1952":{"dur":2,"text":"testing it with kids and showing how"},"1954":{"dur":2,"text":"we could have this character, Goldie,"},"1957":{"dur":3,"text":"kind of walk kids through STEM curriculum in a way"},"1961":{"dur":4,"text":"that wasn't intimidating for the kids or the teachers"},"1965":{"dur":3,"text":"and so we started launching these classroom kits."},"1969":{"dur":2,"text":"We started putting out apps"},"1971":{"dur":4,"text":"and we started developing a bible for an animated series"},"1976":{"dur":2,"text":"and so really kind of thinking about"},"1979":{"dur":3,"text":"if Disney Princess over the last 10 years"},"1984":{"dur":3,"text":"has built an entire lifestyle around being a princess"},"1988":{"dur":3,"text":"with cartoons and films and apps and books"},"1992":{"dur":3,"text":"and room decor and costumes where every little girl"},"1995":{"dur":2,"text":"gets to live out a princess fantasy,"},"1998":{"dur":1,"text":"we started to kind of shift our strategy"},"2000":{"dur":2,"text":"and think, well, how could GoldieBlox"},"2002":{"dur":4,"text":"enable that maker culture, that maker lifestyle?"},"2007":{"dur":3,"text":"How do we enable every little girl to be a maker?"},"2010":{"dur":4,"text":"And how does GoldieBlox, the character and her friends"},"2015":{"dur":2,"text":"inspire girls to wanna build and invent,"},"2017":{"dur":3,"text":"not just do their hair or put on makeup?"},"2022":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's been a very circuitous path,"},"2030":{"dur":3,"text":"just to recap kind of the lessons learned over the years."},"2033":{"dur":4,"text":"So number one, the concept of being an entrepreneur"},"2039":{"dur":2,"text":"I think has been so important."},"2044":{"dur":2,"text":"Again, the notion of just hustling,"},"2048":{"dur":3,"text":"bringing people onboard and I think one thing"},"2052":{"dur":3,"text":"to point out about that that's important"},"2056":{"dur":2,"text":"is when you have something like GoldieBlox"},"2059":{"dur":2,"text":"that has a social mission that's bigger than you"},"2062":{"dur":3,"text":"where if you succeed, it's going to benefit other people,"},"2065":{"dur":2,"text":"it's gonna help change the world,"},"2067":{"dur":3,"text":"it kind of gives you the mojo to go out"},"2071":{"dur":2,"text":"and make kind of audacious asks"},"2074":{"dur":2,"text":"and go ask people to get involved and be a part of it"},"2077":{"dur":1,"text":"'cause it's not in some weird"},"2078":{"dur":2,"text":"gross self-promoting kind of way."},"2080":{"dur":2,"text":"It's in a way where you know that"},"2083":{"dur":2,"text":"you're doing something bigger than yourself"},"2085":{"dur":1,"text":"and I think that's what really enabled me"},"2086":{"dur":2,"text":"to sort of act like that entrepreneur"},"2089":{"dur":2,"text":"when normally I often wasn't the

[Audience Member] So I'm a guy, I'm an engineer."},"2419":{"dur":1,"text":"I have a six-year-old daughter"},"2420":{"dur":2,"text":"and so I'm doing my best to try and encourage her"},"2423":{"dur":1,"text":"in this way and getting these GoldieBlox,"},"2424":{"dur":3,"text":"but I'm wondering what thinking you've given to those"},"2428":{"dur":2,"text":"who maybe don't come

GoldieBlox"},"2451":{"dur":4,"text":"was kind of this breakout was because I think we realized"},"2457":{"dur":4,"text":"early on that most people aren't advanced engineers"},"2462":{"dur":2,"text":"and there are very few women who are engineers"},"2464":{"dur":3,"text":"and so if this product line was only focused"},"2468":{"dur":3,"text":"around people who really deeply understand engineering,"},"2471":{"dur":2,"text":"we were gonna have a pretty niche market"},"2474":{"dur":1,"text":"and so really early on,"},"2478":{"dur":2,"text":"and we continue to do this more and more,"},"2480":{"dur":3,"text":"was how do we introduce these engineering concepts"},"2484":{"dur":3,"text":"in such a way that it is accessible to anybody"},"2487":{"dur":3,"text":"so you don't need to have an engineering degree?"},"2490":{"dur":1,"text":"How do you make it fun?"},"2491":{"dur":1,"text":"How do you make it so that kids"},"2493":{"dur":1,"text":"are building and playing with stuff"},"2495":{"dur":2,"text":"and they don't even know that they're learning something?"},"2497":{"dur":2,"text":"So that was really our goal"},"2500":{"dur":2,"text":"and I would say that along the way"},"2502":{"dur":1,"text":"as we've been developing more and more products"},"2504":{"dur":4,"text":"and kind of seeing how people have reacted with them,"},"2509":{"dur":2,"text":"if anything I've learned that really"},"2511":{"dur":3,"text":"the more fun you make it and the less you try"},"2517":{"dur":3,"text":"and kind of make it feel like you're in school, the better"},"2520":{"dur":3,"text":"and I think what we have found that helps"},"2526":{"dur":2,"text":"is kind of from the product experience,"},"2529":{"dur":1,"text":"it needs to be so fun,"},"2531":{"dur":2,"text":"kids don't even realize they're learning,"},"2534":{"dur":3,"text":"but offering parents tools, parents who are interested"},"2537":{"dur":2,"text":"in getting their kids interested in this stuff."},"2540":{"dur":3,"text":"We've been actually offering a lot in our social media."},"2543":{"dur":2,"text":"So

that,"},"2552":{"dur":1,"text":"so we've really sort of separated it out"},"2554":{"dur":2,"text":"so the play experience, the toys have to be fun."},"2556":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a toy, but we have found ways"},"2559":{"dur":1,"text":"of sort of engaging with parents"},"2561":{"dur":3,"text":"sort of separately on those platforms."},"2566":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Audience Member] So it seems that you didn't have"},"2567":{"dur":2,"text":"investments in the first few years,"},"2570":{"dur":2,"text":"so what is different with that and what is"},"2572":{"dur":4,"text":"the biggest difference after you got the investment?"},"2577":{"dur":0,"text":"- Sure."},"2578":{"dur":1,"text":"The question was it seems like we didn't,"},"2580":{"dur":1,"text":"what was the difference between"},"2581":{"dur":2,"text":"pre-investment and post-investment?"},"2586":{"dur":2,"text":"So at the beginning I was really"},"2590":{"dur":2,"text":"building the company off of my life savings,"},"2593":{"dur":2,"text":"so I had quit my job and I had saved up"},"2596":{"dur":1,"text":"a certain amount of money in my bank account"},"2598":{"dur":3,"text":"and was like, okay, this money's gonna last me a year"},"2601":{"dur":2,"text":"to really go for this because I had been"},"2603":{"dur":1,"text":"kind of working on nights and weekends"},"2605":{"dur":2,"text":"and in my spare time and I had just gotten to the point"},"2607":{"dur":3,"text":"where I'm like, I'm never gonna get somewhere"},"2612":{"dur":2,"text":"if I just only do it in my spare time."},"2614":{"dur":2,"text":"I gotta go all in or it's never gonna happen"},"2617":{"dur":1,"text":"and so it was scary to do that"},"2619":{"dur":3,"text":"'cause I'm like, well, what if I fail?"},"2622":{"dur":2,"text":"But then I thought, okay, what's the worst case scenario"},"2625":{"dur":2,"text":"here is that I spend a year of my life savings,"},"2628":{"dur":2,"text":"I run out of money, it didn't work out"},"2630":{"dur":3,"text":"and so I'll just go get a job, you know?"},"2635":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll never regret kind of giving it a real go"},"2638":{"dur":1,"text":"of something that I was passionate about."},"2640":{"dur":2,"text":"Even if it doesn't work out, I would never regret that"},"2642":{"dur":1,"text":"and so at the beginning, kind of going off"},"2644":{"dur":3,"text":"of my life savings, one of the benefits of that"},"2648":{"dur":2,"text":"was that with such few resources,"},"2651":{"dur":3,"text":"I didn't have the money to spend on expensive prototypes"},"2654":{"dur":3,"text":"and as a result, I had to make quick and dirty prototypes"},"2658":{"dur":1,"text":"and they weren't as precious to me"},"2659":{"dur":2,"text":"and so I'd be willing to just toss the idea"},"2662":{"dur":2,"text":"'cause I hadn't spent $5,000 on it,"},"2665":{"dur":2,"text":"convincing myself that it was a great idea"},"2667":{"dur":3,"text":"even though observing kids hating it, you know?"},"2670":{"dur":2,"text":"So there was a huge advantage"},"2673":{"dur":1,"text":"to just going off my life savings."},"2675":{"dur":2,"text":"Another thing was that because I didn't have"},"2677":{"dur":4,"text":"a huge investment, I decided to do crowdfunding."},"2683":{"dur":1,"text":"If I had raised a bunch of money at the beginning,"},"2685":{"dur":1,"text":"I probably wouldn't have done crowdfunding."},"2686":{"dur":2,"text":"I probably would have gone the traditional route"},"2688":{"dur":2,"text":"of selling into brick and mortar stores,"},"2691":{"dur":2,"text":"but by doing crowdfunding, it was actually"},"2693":{"dur":3,"text":"a very great marketing tool because it put the idea out"},"2696":{"dur":4,"text":"and it ended up going viral and so these were just"},"2701":{"dur":2,"text":"great things that happened out of me"},"2703":{"dur":3,"text":"kind of going off at the beginning with my life savings."},"2707":{"dur":4,"text":"We raised our first major round of capital right after"},"2712":{"dur":4,"text":"the Kickstarter had kind of gone through the roof"},"2716":{"dur":3,"text":"and there was a huge change after that."},"2719":{"dur":1,"text":"I think the biggest thing is once you start"},"2720":{"dur":2,"text":"raising real money, it really enables you"},"2723":{"dur":2,"text":"to start actually hiring employees,"},"2725":{"dur":2,"text":"is probably one of the biggest changes"},"2728":{"dur":4,"text":"and so very quickly it went from sort of feeling like"},"2732":{"dur":4,"text":"volunteers, you're in an apartment to you're a company."},"2738":{"dur":0,"text":"You're set up."},"2739":{"dur":1,"text":"You have weekly meetings."},"2741":{"dur":2,"text":"You have annual reviews."},"2744":{"dur":3,"text":"It formalizes things pretty quickly."},"2749":{"dur":1,"text":"The other thing is once you take in money,"},"2750":{"dur":3,"text":"then you have investors who have certain expectations"},"2754":{"dur":4,"text":"and a lot of times the investors wanna see you make"},"2758":{"dur":2,"text":"as much money as quickly as possible"},"2761":{"dur":3,"text":"and many times that's actually maybe not"},"2764":{"dur":1,"text":"the best thing that you should be doing"},"2766":{"dur":3,"text":"and so one last thing, I'm kind of rambling here,"},"2770":{"dur":2,"text":"but I think that I've learned that took me a real long time"},"2773":{"dur":4,"text":"to learn that I know now is it's really good to,"},"2777":{"dur":2,"text":"you know, it's important to find great investors,"},"2780":{"dur":1,"text":"but it's also important to find"},"2781":{"dur":2,"text":"really great strategic advisors as well"},"2784":{"dur":3,"text":"who are really deeply knowledgeable about your space"},"2788":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's really important to formalize things,"},"2792":{"dur":2,"text":"whether it's quarterly board meetings or whatever,"},"2795":{"dur":2,"text":"to make sure that the investors"},"2797":{"dur":1,"text":"who have money in the company,"},"2798":{"dur":2,"text":"but also the advisors who know the right things"},"2801":{"dur":2,"text":"you should be doing are all in the same room"},"2804":{"dur":2,"text":"so that if the investor's saying, \"No, sell, sell, sell."},"2807":{"dur":1,"text":"\"More, more, more."},"2808":{"dur":1,"text":"\"More money, more money, more money.\""},"2809":{"dur":1,"text":"And you're on the phone like, \"Okay, okay.\""},"2811":{"dur":2,"text":"Then on the phone with the other advisor, \"Don't do that."},"2814":{"dur":1,"text":"\"You should be focusing on this.\""},"2815":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Oh, okay, okay.\""},"2817":{"dur":3,"text":"Bring them together 'cause as soon as you start"},"2821":{"dur":2,"text":"taking money and there's just a lot of pressures"},"2823":{"dur":3,"text":"and outside expectations that you need to answer to"},"2827":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's good to kind of get the right people in the room"},"2830":{"dur":4,"text":"sort of discussing it as a group rather than separately."},"2835":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Audience Member] What are your thoughts on"},"2836":{"dur":3,"text":"measuring the impact of GoldieBlox on girls'"},"2840":{"dur":2,"text":"sensory motor and cognitive skills?"},"2844":{"dur":2,"text":"- The question was how do you measure the impact"},"2846":{"dur":3,"text":"of GoldieBlox on girls' motor skills"},"2850":{"dur":2,"text":"and their interest in engineering?"},"2854":{"dur":4,"text":"So early on, I had to decide whether I was gonna set up"},"2858":{"dur":2,"text":"GoldieBlox as a for-profit or not-for-profit"},"2861":{"dur":1,"text":"and it was a kind of tricky thing"},"2862":{"dur":2,"text":"'cause I'm like, well, GoldieBlox could be a nonprofit"},"2865":{"dur":3,"text":"because it's doing this great social mission,"},"2868":{"dur":2,"text":"but at the same time it's a consumer product"},"2870":{"dur":2,"text":"and it could be a for-profit company"},"2873":{"dur":1,"text":"and I wasn't sure which way to go"},"2874":{"dur":1,"text":"and actually part of the reason why"},"2876":{"dur":3,"text":"I chose the for-profit route was I felt like"},"2879":{"dur":3,"text":"it would be a faster way to achieve our goals."},"2885":{"dur":2,"text":"The nonprofit route requires you to do"},"2887":{"dur":2,"text":"a lot of measurement on things"},"2889":{"dur":2,"text":"that I sort of felt like might be difficult to measure."},"2892":{"dur":2,"text":"It might take a really long time to measure"},"2894":{"dur":3,"text":"and so I'd worked in the nonprofit world before"},"2898":{"dur":1,"text":"and I had seen those challenges"},"2900":{"dur":2,"text":"and so right now the way I measure"},"2903":{"dur":2,"text":"GoldieBlox's success is a few things."},"2905":{"dur":2,"text":"So one, a lot of it's anecdotal."},"2911":{"dur":4,"text":"So every day we get photos and letters and videos"},"2915":{"dur":1,"text":"of kids and their parents writing in,"},"2917":{"dur":3,"text":"telling us how

difference.\""},"2931":{"dur":1,"text":"The other way to just tell we're making a difference"},"2932":{"dur":3,"text":"is how many kids are buying our toys"},"2936":{"dur":1,"text":"and coming back and buying more"},"2938":{"dur":1,"text":"because if they're buying them and playing with them,"},"2939":{"dur":1,"text":"then we know that they're building"},"2940":{"dur":2,"text":"and they're learning something."},"2943":{"dur":3,"text":"Then the other way is there have been universities"},"2947":{"dur":1,"text":"and sort of third parties who have been interested"},"2949":{"dur":1,"text":"in the effects that you're talking about"},"2951":{"dur":1,"text":"and so we have given them the green light"},"2953":{"dur":2,"text":"to go and conduct research studies,"},"2955":{"dur":1,"text":"which is really great because then"},"2956":{"dur":1,"text":"we're not conducting our own research study"},"2958":{"dur":1,"text":"where then we can go publish some article"},"2960":{"dur":2,"text":"about the change that we made where we stacked the deck"},"2963":{"dur":2,"text":"and made it seem better than it was."},"2965":{"dur":1,"text":"I actually am more interested"},"2966":{"dur":2,"text":"in these unbiased third party studies."},"2968":{"dur":2,"text":"One recently came out that was done by Penn State"},"2970":{"dur":2,"text":"over a period of three years and it's fascinating"},"2973":{"dur":1,"text":"to see what they've learned"},"2974":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's gonna be published publicly soon."},"2980":{"dur":3,"text":"- [Audience Member] How are you going to"},"2983":{"dur":2,"text":"put the product in poor countries?"},"2988":{"dur":1,"text":"- Oh, that's a great question."},"2989":{"dur":3,"text":"How are we gonna sell the product in poor countries?"},"2993":{"dur":4,"text":"So growing internationally is a beast unto itself."},"3005":{"dur":3,"text":"I have learned the hard way that focusing"},"3009":{"dur":2,"text":"on getting

keeping in mind your long-term goal"},"3027":{"dur":1,"text":"of wanting to make it available"},"3028":{"dur":3,"text":"to little kids all around the world."},"3033":{"dur":4,"text":"Our plan for that is actually by creating an animated series"},"3038":{"dur":2,"text":"for GoldieBlox and her friends"},"3041":{"dur":2,"text":"and distributing that globally and finding a partner"},"3044":{"dur":2,"text":"that gets that out all around the world,"},"3046":{"dur":2,"text":"will enable us for more kids to find out"},"3049":{"dur":2,"text":"about GoldieBlox all around the world"},"3051":{"dur":2,"text":"and once we've done that, then that enables us"},"3053":{"dur":3,"text":"to find partners who are gonna create GoldieBlox products"},"3057":{"dur":2,"text":"that are available to those kids around the world"},"3060":{"dur":3,"text":"and once we've done that, we'll be able to find partners"},"3063":{"dur":4,"text":"like great foundations or nonprofits that wanna help pay"},"3067":{"dur":4,"text":"to make it available to kids who can't afford it."},"3073":{"dur":3,"text":"- It's really inspiring and I literally was moved to tears"},"3076":{"dur":2,"text":"many times during your talk 'cause it's just so important"},"3079":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'm curious about sort of building on"},"3081":{"dur":4,"text":"this last question, this GoldieBlox has blonde hair"},"3086":{"dur":4,"text":"and blue eyes and looks like certain types of kids."},"3091":{"dur":3,"text":"Are you planning on sort of making a more diverse set"},"3095":{"dur":2,"text":"of

have."},"3102":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't know if you can really see,"},"3104":{"dur":4,"text":"but Goldie's best friend, so Ruby who's African American,"},"3109":{"dur":3,"text":"Li who's Chinese, and Farrah is Hispanic,"},"3113":{"dur":3,"text":"so we actually already have a crew of diverse characters,"},"3116":{"dur":2,"text":"which is incredibly important to me."},"3118":{"dur":2,"text":"Goldie's sort of our main hero protagonist,"},"3121":{"dur":2,"text":"so she's like our Harry Potter if you will,"},"3123":{"dur":3,"text":"but her friends are ethnically
