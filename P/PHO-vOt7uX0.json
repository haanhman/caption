here"},"499":{"dur":1,"text":"at home."},"500":{"dur":5,"text":"So in 2002, when the average ARV\nprice was upwards of $10,000,"},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"the Clinton Health Access\nInitiative as a

any of that\nwould have utility here?"},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"We thought about\nkind of heart health."},"650":{"dur":4,"text":"Can we help drive down\nthe price for treatment?"},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"Could I be the poster\nboy for prevention?"},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"Like, what can I do?"},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"And the American\nHeart

for Americans"},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"who care about any concern\nthat's facing our country."},"738":{"dur":2,"text":"In 2013, the Joint\nChiefs of Staff"},"740":{"dur":4,"text":"declared childhood

we assess success at the\nfoundation or in our family."},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"We're always trying to work\nourselves out of a job."},"784":{"dur":2,"text":"And so because increasingly,\nchildhood

elsewhere."},"824":{"dur":3,"text":"That to us is ultimately\nwhat success looks like,"},"828":{"dur":1,"text":"when the governments\nthat we help negotiate"},"829":{"dur":2,"text":"with the generic
