me."},"149":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the allure of university tenure, right?"},"151":{"dur":0,"text":"(audience laughing)"},"152":{"dur":0,"text":"Check."},"154":{"dur":2,"text":"The second commitment was, I was gonna go"},"156":{"dur":2,"text":"and try to study how we could create organizations"},"158":{"dur":3,"text":"where speaking up was welcomed as opposed to

a half."},"173":{"dur":2,"text":"And then the third decision that I made"},"175":{"dur":2,"text":"was to never again enter a women's bathroom."},"177":{"dur":1,"text":"(audience laughing)"},"179":{"dur":2,"text":"Proud to say I've lived up to that one too."},"181":{"dur":2,"text":"But one of the things I've really been up to since then"},"184":{"dur":1,"text":"is I've been studying people that I've,"},"185":{"dur":1,"text":"I've come to call originals."},"187":{"dur":1,"text":"And when I think of originals,"},"188":{"dur":1,"text":"they're the people who are not like me."},"190":{"dur":2,"text":"Right, who are comfortable standing out and speaking up,"},"193":{"dur":2,"text":"who are non-conformists, who are willing"},"195":{"dur":2,"text":"to drive the creativity and change in the world."},"198":{"dur":2,"text":"And they seem to only get degrees from Stanford."},"200":{"dur":3,"text":"By last account, you seem to have a monopoly"},"203":{"dur":1,"text":"on this particular tendency,"},"205":{"dur":1,"text":"but I really wanted to know"},"207":{"dur":2,"text":"how we could all become more original,"},"209":{"dur":1,"text":"but more importantly how we can"},"210":{"dur":1,"text":"be more effectively original."},"211":{"dur":2,"text":"Right, because so often we're ahead of our time."},"214":{"dur":2,"text":"Or it ends up being really lonely"},"216":{"dur":1,"text":"when we have creative ideas."},"218":{"dur":1,"text":"And I wanted to know, what do we do about that,"},"220":{"dur":2,"text":"and then more broadly how do you build an organization"},"222":{"dur":2,"text":"where originality thrives?"},"224":{"dur":1,"text":"And so I wanted to bring to you today"},"225":{"dur":2,"text":"a top 10 list of the most important things I've learned"},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"about what it takes to build cultures"},"230":{"dur":1,"text":"of productive originality."},"232":{"dur":2,"text":"But sadly I could only think of about six."},"235":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is gonna be a top six list."},"237":{"dur":1,"text":"Are you ready?"},"238":{"dur":0,"text":"Are you ready?"},"239":{"dur":0,"text":"- [Audience] Yes!"},"240":{"dur":0,"text":"- Alright, I was gonna do it anyway,"},"241":{"dur":1,"text":"but I appreciate your enthusiasm."},"242":{"dur":1,"text":"(audience laughing)"},"243":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I will say that I am gonna say almost nothing"},"247":{"dur":1,"text":"about Creativity today."},"248":{"dur":2,"text":"And the reason for that is, I kind of wrote wrote Originals"},"250":{"dur":1,"text":"as a sequel to Creativity."},"252":{"dur":3,"text":"We have tons of books, mostly written by gurus with no data,"},"255":{"dur":2,"text":"but also some books with real data behind them,"},"258":{"dur":2,"text":"that teach us how to generate good ideas."},"260":{"dur":2,"text":"And I don't think that's the problem in the world."},"263":{"dur":1,"text":"I think the problem is, we don't have enough people"},"264":{"dur":2,"text":"who know how to champion original ideas."},"267":{"dur":1,"text":"And I want to talk about how to do that,"},"268":{"dur":1,"text":"so what do you do after you have an idea,"},"270":{"dur":1,"text":"so you can think of this talk as a little bit like"},"272":{"dur":1,"text":"a sequel to Creativity."},"275":{"dur":1,"text":"So the first thing that I learned,"},"276":{"dur":3,"text":"is I think that most originality dies"},"280":{"dur":1,"text":"in the idea selection process."},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"That we have tons of great creative ideas"},"284":{"dur":1,"text":"that could change the world,"},"285":{"dur":1,"text":"but we don't have enough people who know"},"286":{"dur":1,"text":"which ones to bet on."},"289":{"dur":2,"text":"And, there is a brilliant former student of mine,"},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"named Justin Berg, who has tackled this problem."},"294":{"dur":2,"text":"Unfortunately, he joined the Stanford faculty recently"},"297":{"dur":3,"text":"so I don't get to work with him as much as I used to."},"300":{"dur":1,"text":"But he's over at the GSB."},"302":{"dur":1,"text":"What Justin wanted to do is figure out,"},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"how do you know if an idea is going to take off?"},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"And he went to a really weird place to do this,"},"309":{"dur":2,"text":"he studied the circus arts."},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"So think about Cirque du Soleil for example."},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"He got hundreds of circus artists to submit videos"},"316":{"dur":3,"text":"of their brand new acts that had never been seen before."},"320":{"dur":1,"text":"And then he got over 13,000 audience members"},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"to watch them, rate them, and then if they wanted to,"},"324":{"dur":2,"text":"they could donate their own money to the performers,"},"326":{"dur":1,"text":"which is a really clear way to figure out,"},"328":{"dur":2,"text":"would you pay to see these people live."},"331":{"dur":3,"text":"And then after we know which videos are hits with audiences,"},"334":{"dur":1,"text":"he goes and he has lots of different groups"},"336":{"dur":1,"text":"watch the videos and try to predict"},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"which ones are gonna be successes."},"340":{"dur":1,"text":"First group that he looks at"},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"is circus performers themselves."},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"And they are awful at this."},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"They on average, if they have to put their own video"},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"ranked in a set of 10, they rank their own video"},"350":{"dur":1,"text":"two spots too high."},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"They're like this is my performance, of course it's amazing!"},"354":{"dur":1,"text":"How could anyone not love it?"},"356":{"dur":1,"text":"And they have a really hard time"},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"seeing their own work objectively, so duh,"},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"we can't trust people to judge their own ideas."},"363":{"dur":1,"text":"So Justin says, we've gotta to leaders and managers."},"365":{"dur":1,"text":"They're the gatekeepers."},"366":{"dur":1,"text":"Right, we pay them to decide"},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"which ideas live and which ones will die."},"369":{"dur":1,"text":"Except leaders and managers are almost as bad"},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"as the performers themselves."},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"But for the opposite reason, instead of being too positive"},"376":{"dur":1,"text":"they're too negative."},"378":{"dur":2,"text":"And I know none of you have ever run into a manager"},"381":{"dur":3,"text":"in your lives who shot down ideas, but"},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"(audience laughs)"},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"it's particularly middle managers who are the worst at this,"},"388":{"dur":1,"text":"they tend to be the most conservative."},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"Right, they've worked for years to earn this spot,"},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's a very long way to fall,"},"395":{"dur":1,"text":"whereas if you are at the bottom and you're new,"},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"you have nothing to lose, you have no status anyway."},"399":{"dur":1,"text":"And if you're all the way at the top,"},"401":{"dur":3,"text":"you've built up a lot of power and credibility and respect,"},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"and you're expected to take some risks"},"406":{"dur":1,"text":"and deviate a little bit."},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"So, why are middle managers in particular"},"410":{"dur":1,"text":"so bad at judging ideas?"},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"Well one problem is that they tend"},"414":{"dur":1,"text":"to rely a lot on intuition."},"415":{"dur":1,"text":"They're like, yeah, I've worked my way up"},"417":{"dur":3,"text":"and I have all of this experience and I want to use that."},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"And, you know, I think it, look."},"422":{"dur":1,"text":"Experience is important."},"423":{"dur":1,"text":"And especially those of you"},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"who are engineers know this, right?"},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"From having a lot of experience driving a car,"},"429":{"dur":1,"text":"you know how to build an engine, right?"},"431":{"dur":1,"text":"And from all the experience you have"},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"obeying the laws of gravity, you must be a physicist."},"435":{"dur":0,"text":"Right?"},"437":{"dur":0,"text":"Maybe not."},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"But what's interesting about intuition is,"},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"I think of intuition just as"},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"unconscious or subconscious pattern recognition."},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's a useful source of insight in a lot of your life."},"448":{"dur":3,"text":"But it is not a good basis for judging original ideas."},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"Because your intuitions about what's gonna work"},"454":{"dur":1,"text":"are based on your past experience."},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"What's worked in the past is totally irrelevant"},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"to trying to figure out what's going to work tomorrow"},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"if you're trying to do something new and different."},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"So managers tend to get stuck in prototypes."},"466":{"dur":1,"text":"They ask, what's worked in the past,"},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"they compare your idea to that,"},"470":{"dur":3,"text":"and then if it looks different, they say reject."},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"And you see this a lot in entertainment, right."},"475":{"dur":3,"text":"Remember the TV show that was shot down by NBC"},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"because it was a show about nothing?"},"481":{"dur":3,"text":"And all these executives looked at it and they're like,"},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"you know, a sitcom, like all of our great sitcoms"},"488":{"dur":1,"text":"have two things in common."},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"Number one, their plot lines actually make sense,"},"492":{"dur":3,"text":"and number two, I root for at least one of the characters."},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is not true for Seinfeld."},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"But, there's an executive there, Rick Ludwin,"},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"who doesn't even work in sitcoms,"},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"he comes from the Variety and Specials department,"},"505":{"dur":1,"text":"and he watches it and he says yes,"},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"Seinfeld breaks all the rules of a great sitcom,"},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"but I don't care because it made me laugh."},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's what comedy is supposed to do."},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"So he's willing to bet on it, and he's only able to do that"},"516":{"dur":1,"text":"because he doesn't have those years of experience"},"518":{"dur":1,"text":"that these managers do."},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"The other problem that managers run into"},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"is they have skewed incentives."},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you're a manager and you bet on a bad idea,"},"526":{"dur":1,"text":"you could destroy your career."},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"It's gonna embarrass you at minimum."},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"Whereas if you reject a good idea,"},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"this is kind of a good situation for you"},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"because no one will ever know."},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"And so what are you gonna do, right?"},"539":{"dur":1,"text":"Are you gonna play it safe or are you gonna take some risks,"},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"and most managers choose to play it safe."},"544":{"dur":2,"text":"So, if we can't trust you to judge your own ideas,"},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"we can't trust your bosses either, who do we go to?"},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"Justin found a third group that excelled at this."},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"It was actually peers."},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"Fellow circus artists judging each other's videos."},"556":{"dur":1,"text":"So they were able to have a little bit of distance"},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"and objectivity, right, and they would say things like,"},"561":{"dur":2,"text":"you know that act where you dress up like a clown?"},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"Don't do that."},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"That was actually an empirical fact in the data,"},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"clowns are universally hated."},"569":{"dur":1,"text":"(audience laughing)"},"570":{"dur":4,"text":"but, unlike the managers, who did have that distance,"},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"they also were invested in seeing new ideas take off."},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"Right, and so they would, instead of looking"},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"for reasons to say no, they would come in and say,"},"582":{"dur":1,"text":"you know, this is kind of weird,"},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"but let me take a chance on this,"},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"or let's take another look at least."},"588":{"dur":0,"text":"And so one lesson here"},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"is that you should go to your creative peers"},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"much more often than you do for feedback on your ideas."},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"Those are the people who will give you"},"595":{"dur":1,"text":"the best input typically."},"597":{"dur":1,"text":"But Justin wanted to go further, and he said"},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"I want to teach managers to be less bad at this."},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"So, he found a five minute exercise that helped a lot."},"606":{"dur":3,"text":"All he did was, before managers judged other people's ideas,"},"609":{"dur":1,"text":"he made them spend five minutes brainstorming"},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"about their own ideas."},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"And that was enough to make them just as good as peers"},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"at judging new ideas."},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"Because they were now out of an evaluative mindset."},"620":{"dur":1,"text":"And in a creative mindset."},"621":{"dur":1,"text":"They were much more open."},"623":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think this should be a rule, right?"},"625":{"dur":1,"text":"Never judge other people's ideas"},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"unless you've been in brainstorming mode first."},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"Because it keeps you really receptive"},"630":{"dur":1,"text":"to weird possibilities."},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"And I would go a step further though, and say"},"634":{"dur":1,"text":"you've gotta be careful when you do that,"},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"because if you brainstorm about the same domain"},"638":{"dur":1,"text":"that you're about to judge,"},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"you're just gonna fall in love with your own ideas."},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"So the best case scenario is,"},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"you brainstorm about something totally unrelated"},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"for a few minutes, and then you come to look"},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"at this new set of ideas."},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's it, that's all there is to idea selection."},"651":{"dur":1,"text":"Alright, maybe it's a little more complicated."},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"But, let's say you get better at this,"},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"and you improve your skills at idea selection."},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"Your next challenge is, you've gotta pitch your ideas,"},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"right, you have to speak up, you have to find allies"},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"and supporters, and build a coalition."},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"And a lot of us get really nervous in this process."},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"I know I thought, when I started studying originals,"},"670":{"dur":1,"text":"that they were just cut from a different cloth"},"671":{"dur":1,"text":"than the rest of us."},"673":{"dur":3,"text":"That they didn't feel the same doubt and fear and anxiety"},"676":{"dur":0,"text":"that we do."},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"And I had a chance to interview a whole bunch of them,"},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"and I was surprised that when I talked"},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"to Mark Cuban and Elon Musk and Larry Page"},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"and a whole bunch of their peers,"},"686":{"dur":1,"text":"they all said the same thing, which was that"},"688":{"dur":3,"text":"they were terrified when they had their big ideas."},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"But, they chose to take action anyway."},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was trying to figure out what propelled them to act"},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"even in the face of anxiety and fear."},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"And what I learned actually traced back"},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"to the time when I was in school."},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"So for those of you who are students,"},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"I want you to think back to the last time"},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"you had a big exam to prepare for."},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"And the question is, about a week before your big test,"},"712":{"dur":1,"text":"what were you doing?"},"713":{"dur":1,"text":"So if you're an optimist,"},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"optimists start about a week beforehand,"},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"imagining the perfect performance."},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"They're visualizing knowing the answers"},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"to every question on the test, and acing it,"},"724":{"dur":1,"text":"and then also being the person who"},"726":{"dur":3,"text":"about 19 minutes into the exam is able to stand up"},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"and shout I won, and then leave."},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"Just to make all their peers really nervous."},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"And, that's, that kinda goes pretty well, right,"},"738":{"dur":2,"text":"optimists are excited by a positive vision of the future,"},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"that motivates them and they study really hard,"},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"and they often ace the test."},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"For those of you who are defensive pessimists,"},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"you have a slightly different emotional experience"},"750":{"dur":1,"text":"going into that exam."},"751":{"dur":1,"text":"So about a week beforehand,"},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"you wake up at 3 a.m. in a cold sweat,"},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"panicked that not only are you going to fail the exam,"},"759":{"dur":1,"text":"you're going to do so badly"},"760":{"dur":1,"text":"that your professor will take away points"},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"on all your previous exams."},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"Because there's no way you could have earned them."},"766":{"dur":4,"text":"And that fear actually starts to create motivation."},"770":{"dur":2,"text":"You don't want to fail, and so you study really hard."},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"And ironically, you do just as well"},"775":{"dur":1,"text":"as the strategic optimist."},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"That anxiety actually becomes a source of motivation."},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"And across the board, defensive pessimism"},"784":{"dur":1,"text":"turns out to be an effective strategy."},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"In that, if you can psych yourself up"},"788":{"dur":1,"text":"into the state where you are convinced"},"790":{"dur":1,"text":"that you are going to fail,"},"791":{"dur":1,"text":"that will motivate you to work a lot harder"},"793":{"dur":1,"text":"on not just preparing for a test,"},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"but pitching an idea, and trying to find people"},"797":{"dur":1,"text":"who will support it."},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"And what's funny is, then you'll succeed,"},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"and afterward, when you have a new idea,"},"804":{"dur":1,"text":"or a new exam, you convince yourself,"},"805":{"dur":2,"text":"no, this one is different, this time I really am gonna fail."},"808":{"dur":1,"text":"And you start freaking out over and over again"},"809":{"dur":1,"text":"and that cycle continues."},"811":{"dur":2,"text":"Because that anxiety is necessary to motivate you."},"814":{"dur":1,"text":"And the funny thing about this is,"},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"there's one way to sabotage the performance"},"817":{"dur":4,"text":"of defensive pessimists, which is you make them happy."},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"That's not a joke, that's a data point actually."},"824":{"dur":1,"text":"If you put defensive pessimists in a good mood,"},"825":{"dur":1,"text":"their performance drops."},"827":{"dur":1,"text":"Because they no longer have the anxiety that they need"},"829":{"dur":3,"text":"to propel themselves into that frenzy of effort."},"832":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think this is a really critical skill."},"836":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think that sometimes, that anxiety also leads"},"839":{"dur":3,"text":"to really creative solutions to problems."},"845":{"dur":3,"text":"(audience laughing)"},"850":{"dur":3,"text":"now, that for me begs the question of, of,"},"854":{"dur":2,"text":"what do you do when that anxiety

that I've learned about this"},"865":{"dur":2,"text":"actually comes out of evolutionary psychology."},"868":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I think you're all familiar of prehistoric theories"},"872":{"dur":1,"text":"of how our minds tended to work."},"874":{"dur":3,"text":"Which is, an oversimplified story that goes like this."},"877":{"dur":1,"text":"So, imagine that you're walking in a jungle."},"879":{"dur":4,"text":"And you see something moving in the bushes in the distance."},"883":{"dur":2,"text":"And you watch this happen, and you're

you see that thing"},"904":{"dur":3,"text":"moving in the bushes and you're like tiger run!"},"908":{"dur":2,"text":"And then you get to survive and pass on your genes."},"910":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think many experts believe"},"913":{"dur":2,"text":"that we evolved an amygdala to serve this function,"},"915":{"dur":2,"text":"which is basically often the fear circuitry involved"},"918":{"dur":2,"text":"in driving that gut reaction, which bypasses"},"920":{"dur":2,"text":"your higher level thinking capabilities."},"923":{"dur":3,"text":"And just causes you to immediately show fight or flight."},"926":{"dur":1,"text":"The problem is, we can have"},"927":{"dur":2,"text":"those kinds of emotional reactions to events today"},"930":{"dur":1,"text":"that are totally ordinary."},"932":{"dur":1,"text":"That are not survival relevant."},"934":{"dur":3,"text":"And the key is to be able to keep those emotions in check."},"937":{"dur":1,"text":"Another former student, Alison Woodbrooks,"},"939":{"dur":1,"text":"who's now at Harvard Business School,"},"941":{"dur":1,"text":"ended up doing some studies to try to figure out"},"942":{"dur":2,"text":"how to manage that anxiety effectively."},"944":{"dur":3,"text":"And when she asked people, how do you manage anxiety?"},"948":{"dur":1,"text":"She found the most common answer by far"},"950":{"dur":1,"text":"was I try to calm down."},"952":{"dur":2,"text":"I listen to relaxing music, I remind myself"},"954":{"dur":2,"text":"that everything's gonna be okay,"},"956":{"dur":1,"text":"and over 90% of people said"},"958":{"dur":2,"text":"that is the best way to deal with it."},"960":{"dur":1,"text":"And it turns out, it's not."},"962":{"dur":2,"text":"Because when you're super anxious,"},"965":{"dur":2,"text":"it's really hard to slam on the brakes."},"968":{"dur":2,"text":"When you have a brick on a gas

much more effectively."},"978":{"dur":1,"text":"Because excitement just like anxiety"},"980":{"dur":1,"text":"is a high intensity emotion."},"981":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, you can keep your foot on the gas pedal,"},"985":{"dur":1,"text":"and just convert it into something"},"986":{"dur":1,"text":"that's a little bit more energizing,"},"988":{"dur":2,"text":"and the great thing about both anxiety and excitement"},"990":{"dur":2,"text":"is they both involve uncertainty."},"992":{"dur":1,"text":"When you have something coming up in the future"},"994":{"dur":1,"text":"and you don't know what's

idea in the first place."},"1039":{"dur":1,"text":"Why are you excited?"},"1040":{"dur":2,"text":"Is actually a great source of motivation."},"1043":{"dur":2,"text":"Alright, third thing I learned."},"1046":{"dur":2,"text":"Has to do with then, you overcome your anxiety,"},"1048":{"dur":1,"text":"you figured out which idea you want to pitch,"},"1050":{"dur":1,"text":"you're ready to do

actually tapped their songs,"},"1177":{"dur":1,"text":"so instead of clapping, they had a table"},"1179":{"dur":2,"text":"and they went like this."},"1181":{"dur":1,"text":"But before they tapped, they had a chance"},"1183":{"dur":2,"text":"to estimate the probability that other people"},"1185":{"dur":2,"text":"would recognize their song."},"1188":{"dur":3,"text":"And, the average tapper said, eh, 50%."},"1192":{"dur":0,"text":"And then they went and tapped,"},"1193":{"dur":1,"text":"they all had easy songs by the way,"},"1194":{"dur":2,"text":"they did like Mary Had A Little Lamb and Happy

live,"},"1209":{"dur":4,"text":"I was speaking for a large organization a while back,"},"1213":{"dur":1,"text":"and I made the mistake of having people"},"1215":{"dur":2,"text":"shout out their probability estimates out loud."},"1217":{"dur":2,"text":"Before they tapped or clapped."},"1219":{"dur":3,"text":"And I heard a voice shout, 100%!"},"1222":{"dur":1,"text":"(audience laughing)"},"1224":{"dur":2,"text":"and, I couldn't resist, I just started to think like,"},"1226":{"dur":1,"text":"that's just dumb."},"1228":{"dur":1,"text":"(audience laughing)"},"1229":{"dur":1,"text":"like, nothing is ever 100%,"},"1231":{"dur":2,"text":"you do not understand probability theory."},"1233":{"dur":1,"text":"(audience

luckily the guy next to him guessed it right,"},"1245":{"dur":2,"text":"because we were all afraid of the consequences,"},"1247":{"dur":4,"text":"but, but, most of the time, when tappers or clappers"},"1252":{"dur":3,"text":"give high estimates, they are overconfident by a lot."},"1255":{"dur":1,"text":"And I was curious about why,"},"1257":{"dur":1,"text":"and I think you already anticipated the answer,"},"1258":{"dur":1,"text":"which is, in order to clap your song,"},"1260":{"dur":2,"text":"you have to hear the tune in your head."},"1263":{"dur":2,"text":"It's impossible, can't do it otherwise."},"1265":{"dur":1,"text":"That makes it also impossible to imagine"},"1267":{"dur":1,"text":"what your disjointed tapping sounds like"},"1269":{"dur":2,"text":"to someone who is not hearing the tune in their head."},"1271":{"dur":2,"text":"Right, so I do this exercise, and I'm like,"},"1274":{"dur":3,"text":"(humming and clapping the Imperial

randomly)"},"1284":{"dur":1,"text":"What the hell is that?"},"1286":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think this is a great metaphor for what happens"},"1288":{"dur":2,"text":"when we communicate original ideas to other people."},"1291":{"dur":2,"text":"Because when you pitch a new idea,"},"1293":{"dur":2,"text":"you are not only hearing the tune in your head,"},"1295":{"dur":1,"text":"you wrote the song."},"1298":{"dur":2,"text":"You spent days, or weeks, or years"},"1301":{"dur":3,"text":"thinking about this idea, it makes perfect sense to you."},"1304":{"dur":1,"text":"And that makes it really hard to fathom"},"1305":{"dur":1,"text":"what it's gonna sound like to somebody"},"1307":{"dur":1,"text":"who's hearing that idea for the first time."},"1309":{"dur":3,"text":"Who hasn't mastered the lyrics and the melody."},"1312":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I think that the challenge here"},"1314":{"dur":2,"text":"is to master the art of repetition."},"1317":{"dur":1,"text":"And some of you will know,"},"1318":{"dur":1,"text":"there's data on the mere exposure effect,"},"1320":{"dur":2,"text":"which says that it often takes 10 to 20 exposures"},"1323":{"dur":3,"text":"to a new idea or concept before we really start to like it"},"1326":{"dur":1,"text":"and appreciate it."},"1328":{"dur":1,"text":"So the lesson here is, the next time you pitch an idea"},"1330":{"dur":2,"text":"to a colleague or a boss or a venture capitalist"},"1332":{"dur":2,"text":"and it gets shot down, you should just check your watch,"},"1335":{"dur":1,"text":"wait until six minutes go by, and then say,"},"1337":{"dur":1,"text":"here it is again!"},"1339":{"dur":1,"text":"No, maybe not."},"1341":{"dur":2,"text":"I think it's all about taking your unfamiliar idea"},"1343":{"dur":2,"text":"and trying to make it more familiar."},"1345":{"dur":2,"text":"And, there's a great example of this"},"1348":{"dur":2,"text":"that happened at Disney a while back."},"1350":{"dur":1,"text":"So for years Disney made"},"1352":{"dur":2,"text":"animated movies based on fairy tales."},"1354":{"dur":1,"text":"And then at some point they start to worry,"},"1356":{"dur":2,"text":"we're gonna run out of fairy tales."},"1358":{"dur":2,"text":"We need to write original scripts."},"1360":{"dur":2,"text":"So they try their hand at their first ever original script"},"1363":{"dur":2,"text":"for an animated movie, and everyone hates it."},"1365":{"dur":2,"text":"Jeffrey Katzenberg actually laughs at it and says,"},"1368":{"dur":3,"text":"this is a B movie, it'll make 50 grand if we're lucky."},"1371":{"dur":1,"text":"A few screenwriters want to save it,"},"1373":{"dur":1,"text":"so they go back to the drawing board, they rework it,"},"1374":{"dur":1,"text":"they're in a big pitch meeting."},"1376":{"dur":2,"text":"And nobody's really getting it at all,"},"1379":{"dur":2,"text":"and Michael Eisner wants to give it a shot,"},"1381":{"dur":3,"text":"and he says well, I dunno, can you turn this into King Lear?"},"1385":{"dur":1,"text":"Now coincidentally, one of the screenwriters"},"1386":{"dur":2,"text":"has re-read King Lear three weeks earlier."},"1389":{"dur":2,"text":"And is like, yeah, I'm not seeing it."},"1391":{"dur":1,"text":"But that sparks an idea for a producer"},"1393":{"dur":1,"text":"in the back of the room."},"1394":{"dur":3,"text":"And she shouts out, no, this is Hamlet!"},"1398":{"dur":2,"text":"And in that moment the movie gets the green light,"},"1400":{"dur":1,"text":"becomes the most successful film of 1994,"},"1402":{"dur":2,"text":"you might have heard of it, it's called The Lion King."},"1405":{"dur":1,"text":"I didn't realize there was the Hamlet connection there"},"1406":{"dur":3,"text":"until I heard the story, but to me what's remarkable"},"1409":{"dur":3,"text":"about this story, is that the original pitch"},"1413":{"dur":2,"text":"for The Lion King was, I quote,"},"1415":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Bambi in Africa with lions.\""},"1418":{"dur":1,"text":"(audience laughing)"},"1420":{"dur":3,"text":"You hear that pitch, and you're like,"},"1424":{"dur":1,"text":"I have no idea what this movie is gonna be about,"},"1426":{"dur":2,"text":"and I am terrified for Bambi."},"1428":{"dur":4,"text":"Whereas, when it gets reframed as Hamlet with lions,"},"1433":{"dur":1,"text":"now it clicks, and you're like, oh of course,"},"1434":{"dur":2,"text":"the uncle will have to kill the father,"},"1437":{"dur":1,"text":"son's gonna avenge it."},"1438":{"dur":1,"text":"And now you can wrap your mind around the plot"},"1440":{"dur":1,"text":"and the characters."},"1442":{"dur":1,"text":"This is what I mean when I say,"},"1443":{"dur":1,"text":"make the unfamiliar familiar."},"1445":{"dur":1,"text":"Right, build the bridge between your idea"},"1447":{"dur":2,"text":"and something that's already worked before."},"1450":{"dur":1,"text":"You don't want to do this early in the creative process,"},"1452":{"dur":1,"text":"because it often stifles your ability"},"1454":{"dur":1,"text":"to think outside the box."},"1455":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a late-stage communication device, mostly."},"1458":{"dur":1,"text":"And I had a chance to see this in action"},"1460":{"dur":1,"text":"when I first arrived at Wharton."},"1461":{"dur":1,"text":"I was teaching my very first class,"},"1463":{"dur":1,"text":"a student came up to me and he said,"},"1465":{"dur":0,"text":"I want to start a company"},"1466":{"dur":1,"text":"and I'm wondering if you want to invest in it,"},"1467":{"dur":2,"text":"we're gonna sell glasses online."},"1469":{"dur":1,"text":"And we're gonna try to do for glasses"},"1471":{"dur":1,"text":"what Zappos did for shoes."},"1473":{"dur":1,"text":"And I was like, that's ridiculous."},"1474":{"dur":1,"text":"Like, you can't order glasses online,"},"1476":{"dur":2,"text":"you have to go try them on, and you know,"},"1478":{"dur":3,"text":"sort of get your eyes checked, and that's not gonna work."},"1482":{"dur":3,"text":"And of course, then, Neil went on to co-found Warby Parker,"},"1485":{"dur":1,"text":"and company's worth a billion dollars"},"1487":{"dur":1,"text":"and my wife is not happy with me."},"1489":{"dur":2,"text":"but, what's interesting is,"},"1492":{"dur":2,"text":"the Zappos pitch didn't work for me."},"1494":{"dur":1,"text":"I had never ordered a pair of shoes online."},"1496":{"dur":2,"text":"I had heard of Zappos, this was 2009,"},"1498":{"dur":1,"text":"but I was like, yeah, I don't really know how many people"},"1500":{"dur":1,"text":"are doing that, and I don't know"},"1501":{"dur":2,"text":"if that'll work for glasses anyway."},"1503":{"dur":1,"text":"A few months later, they ended up getting called"},"1505":{"dur":2,"text":"the Netflix for eyewear."},"1508":{"dur":2,"text":"And that one absolutely resonated with a lot of people,"},"1510":{"dur":2,"text":"because many of us have that memory of,"},"1513":{"dur":2,"text":"you used to have to drive in your car to Blockbuster"},"1516":{"dur":1,"text":"when you wanted to rent a movie."},"1517":{"dur":1,"text":"And then, you take it home and watch it,"},"1519":{"dur":1,"text":"and you had to physically rewind it."},"1521":{"dur":2,"text":"In order to not get charged a fee."},"1523":{"dur":1,"text":"Nobody does that anymore, right?"},"1525":{"dur":2,"text":"So, the lesson from that for me is,"},"1527":{"dur":3,"text":"the familiarity connections are gonna vary by audience."},"1530":{"dur":2,"text":"Right, what connects the dots for one group of people"},"1532":{"dur":3,"text":"is not necessarily gonna make a difference for another."},"1535":{"dur":2,"text":"And some startups are trying to solve that problem"},"1537":{"dur":2,"text":"by going a little bit too far."},"1542":{"dur":3,"text":"(audience laughing)"},"1551":{"dur":1,"text":"I do think this is overboard,"},"1552":{"dur":2,"text":"but there is real value in the Uber for X pitch, right?"},"1555":{"dur":1,"text":"And the more time you spend with people"},"1557":{"dur":2,"text":"who have backgrounds different from yours,"},"1559":{"dur":2,"text":"explaining your ideas and asking them, like,"},"1561":{"dur":1,"text":"what else does this remind you of,"},"1563":{"dur":1,"text":"what is it similar to?"},"1564":{"dur":1,"text":"The easier time you will have figuring out"},"1566":{"dur":2,"text":"if there's one that actually works."},"1569":{"dur":1,"text":"Alright, fourth thing that I learned,"},"1571":{"dur":2,"text":"this is also about pitching ideas effectively,"},"1573":{"dur":2,"text":"is, every pitch I have ever seen"},"1577":{"dur":3,"text":"starts with, this is the best idea you have ever heard,"},"1580":{"dur":2,"text":"and let me explain to you why it's gonna change the world."},"1582":{"dur":2,"text":"Except for one entrepreneur, who turned it upside down."},"1585":{"dur":1,"text":"His name is Rufus Griscom."},"1587":{"dur":3,"text":"Rufus ended up having kids, and he found"},"1591":{"dur":2,"text":"that all the parenting advice he had gotten beforehand"},"1593":{"dur":2,"text":"was just like a complete lie."},"1595":{"dur":3,"text":"And he said I want to start a website called Babble"},"1598":{"dur":3,"text":"that is going to tell people the truth about parenting."},"1601":{"dur":2,"text":"And, you know, let them know that you will never, ever"},"1604":{"dur":2,"text":"have a night of sleep for the next 15 years."},"1607":{"dur":2,"text":"And, you also will be really unhappy most of the time,"},"1610":{"dur":1,"text":"but it's really joyful and meaningful anyway,"},"1611":{"dur":1,"text":"totally do it."},"1613":{"dur":2,"text":"And he, he decided he needed funding for the website,"},"1616":{"dur":2,"text":"so he goes and starts pitching VC's."},"1618":{"dur":2,"text":"And, one of the things he does in his pitch,"},"1620":{"dur":1,"text":"is he says these are the three reasons"},"1622":{"dur":2,"text":"you should not back my startup."},"1625":{"dur":1,"text":"And everybody is like, what?"},"1626":{"dur":1,"text":"You're coming here asking for money,"},"1628":{"dur":0,"text":"like you're telling me now"},"1629":{"dur":2,"text":"why I should not give you my money?"},"1631":{"dur":1,"text":"Get out of here."},"1632":{"dur":1,"text":"Except he walks away with 3.2 million dollars"},"1634":{"dur":1,"text":"in funding that year."},"1636":{"dur":2,"text":"And then a couple years later, Disney contacts him"},"1638":{"dur":2,"text":"and says we're interested in possibly acquiring Babble."},"1641":{"dur":3,"text":"He goes to Disney, his big presentation includes a slide"},"1644":{"dur":1,"text":"that says, here are the five reasons"},"1646":{"dur":2,"text":"you should not invest in Babble,"},"1648":{"dur":2,"text":"and you shouldn't acquire us."},"1651":{"dur":2,"text":"And they end up paying 40 million dollars for Babble."},"1654":{"dur":2,"text":"So you will not see this happen on Shark Tank."},"1656":{"dur":3,"text":"But, I think Rufus's strategy is ingenious."},"1660":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, first of all it's a marketing gimmick."},"1662":{"dur":1,"text":"Right, like this catches you off guard,"},"1664":{"dur":2,"text":"it's kinda interesting, you think he's creative."},"1666":{"dur":1,"text":"But it's more than that."},"1667":{"dur":2,"text":"Rufus shows that he's willing"},"1669":{"dur":2,"text":"to take an honest look at his business."},"1672":{"dur":2,"text":"And he's able to see it clearly,"},"1674":{"dur":1,"text":"as opposed to just having blinders on."},"1676":{"dur":2,"text":"So he shows he's more trustworthy and credible"},"1678":{"dur":2,"text":"by admitting that it has some flaws."},"1681":{"dur":2,"text":"But the other thing he does is even more interesting."},"1683":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'm gonna need a couple of volunteers"},"1685":{"dur":2,"text":"to try to illustrate this."},"1688":{"dur":2,"text":"Where are you, raise your hands if you're willing."},"1690":{"dur":2,"text":"Alright, right over here, stand up, what's your name?"},"1692":{"dur":0,"text":"- [Man] Brandon."},"1693":{"dur":2,"text":"- Brandon, alright, wait, stay on your feet,"},"1696":{"dur":1,"text":"yeah,

know, seven or eight."},"1721":{"dur":1,"text":"- Okay, good."},"1722":{"dur":2,"text":"You can have a seat now, I need another volunteer."},"1725":{"dur":2,"text":"Alright over here, stand up, what's your name?"},"1727":{"dur":0,"text":"- [Second Man] Akash."},"1728":{"dur":2,"text":"- Akash, great, nice to meet you too."},"1731":{"dur":2,"text":"Can you name for us 37 good things about your life, please."},"1734":{"dur":1,"text":"(audience laughing)"},"1735":{"dur":2,"text":"- [Akash] I'm at Stanford, I'm in this talk,"},"1738":{"dur":1,"text":"I did a lot of things today,"},"1740":{"dur":1,"text":"- Do you want to count them all individually?"},"1741":{"dur":2,"text":"(audience laughing)"},"1743":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Akash] Uh, I have a good family,"},"1745":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, I have a good dad, I have a good mom,"},"1747":{"dur":3,"text":"(audience laughing)"},"1751":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Akash] I have 30 good friends,"},"1753":{"dur":1,"text":"I can name all the 30 if you want."},"1755":{"dur":2,"text":"- Alright, I think we've heard quite enough from you."},"1757":{"dur":1,"text":"(audience laughing)"},"1759":{"dur":1,"text":"Zero to 10, how happy?"},"1760":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Akash] I think, eight?"},"1762":{"dur":0,"text":"- Okay."},"1763":{"dur":2,"text":"So, you can't see it with the law of small numbers here,"},"1765":{"dur":2,"text":"but when you do this experiment with large groups"},"1767":{"dur":1,"text":"and I make my students suffer through it"},"1769":{"dur":1,"text":"individually every fall."},"1771":{"dur":1,"text":"What you will see is, when you ask people"},"1773":{"dur":1,"text":"to predict who's happier,"},"1774":{"dur":1,"text":"the person who names more good things"},"1776":{"dur":1,"text":"is supposed to be happier, right,"},"1777":{"dur":3,"text":"the more blessings you can count, the better your life is."},"1781":{"dur":2,"text":"Except the data tend to show the opposite."},"1783":{"dur":1,"text":"That those of you who name three good things"},"1785":{"dur":1,"text":"are significantly happier than those"},"1787":{"dur":2,"text":"who will name even a dozen."},"1789":{"dur":0,"text":"Why?"},"1790":{"dur":2,"text":"Some of you will know Danny Kahneman and Amos Tversky"},"1793":{"dur":1,"text":"pioneered this research on what's called"},"1794":{"dur":1,"text":"the availability heuristic."},"1796":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's the basic idea that when something"},"1797":{"dur":3,"text":"is hard to think of, we assume it's rare and uncommon,"},"1801":{"dur":1,"text":"and when it's easy to think of,"},"1802":{"dur":3,"text":"we assume it's important and common."},"1805":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, when you have to name three good things,"},"1807":{"dur":2,"text":"it's like, boom boom boom."},"1810":{"dur":3,"text":"That's an easy task, my life must be pretty good."},"1814":{"dur":1,"text":"And many of us, when we have to name"},"1815":{"dur":2,"text":"a bunch more good things, and we're getting to like"},"1817":{"dur":3,"text":"number 11 and 12, you're like, this is kind of hard."},"1821":{"dur":2,"text":"My life is not that great."},"1824":{"dur":1,"text":"And then happiness ratings tend to fall"},"1826":{"dur":2,"text":"by somewhere between half a point and a point"},"1828":{"dur":1,"text":"in many of these examples."},"1830":{"dur":1,"text":"And you can see the same thing"},"1831":{"dur":2,"text":"if you ask people about bad things about their lives."},"1834":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you take somebody who's depressed,"},"1837":{"dur":2,"text":"and you ask them for three bad things about their life,"},"1839":{"dur":2,"text":"it's like, wow, here are the three horrible things,"},"1842":{"dur":1,"text":"my life is infinitely bad."},"1844":{"dur":1,"text":"You ask them for 10 bad things about their life,"},"1846":{"dur":1,"text":"they struggle a little bit more,"},"1847":{"dur":3,"text":"and they're not quite as miserable as they were before."},"1850":{"dur":1,"text":"So, next time you know someone who's depressed,"},"1852":{"dur":2,"text":"just ask them for a list of 4000 horrible things"},"1854":{"dur":2,"text":"that have happened to them,"},"1856":{"dur":2,"text":"and hope that they struggle at some point along the way."},"1859":{"dur":3,"text":"But, no, don't try that one at home, please."},"1863":{"dur":2,"text":"But this has been demonstrated in a lot of domains,"},"1865":{"dur":2,"text":"and my favorite example actually comes from politics."},"1867":{"dur":2,"text":"Where, in the UK, after Tony Blair"},"1870":{"dur":2,"text":"was done with his term as Prime Minister,"},"1872":{"dur":1,"text":"psychologists went and asked people"},"1873":{"dur":2,"text":"to name two good things about,"},"1875":{"dur":1,"text":"excuse me, two bad things about Tony Blair,"},"1877":{"dur":2,"text":"or five bad things about Tony Blair."},"1880":{"dur":1,"text":"And the ones who named five bad things about him"},"1882":{"dur":2,"text":"liked him more afterward."},"1884":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's the same thing, right,"},"1885":{"dur":1,"text":"like I think of two bad things, I'm like, well,"},"1887":{"dur":3,"text":"he has a cooler accent than I do and he still has hair,"},"1890":{"dur":1,"text":"like, what a jerk."},"1893":{"dur":1,"text":"And then when I have to come up with five,"},"1894":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm like you know, this is actually not that easy,"},"1896":{"dur":2,"text":"he's probably not as bad as I thought."},"1899":{"dur":2,"text":"And, this is exactly what Rufus Griscom"},"1901":{"dur":3,"text":"does to his investors and to his acquirers."},"1904":{"dur":1,"text":"Because when he tells you three things"},"1905":{"dur":1,"text":"that are wrong with his startup,"},"1907":{"dur":2,"text":"his investors have to work hard to think of flaws."},"1910":{"dur":1,"text":"And they end up walking away thinking like,"},"1912":{"dur":2,"text":"you know, this startup isn't as bad as I thought."},"1915":{"dur":1,"text":"But then there's an extra part as an investor,"},"1917":{"dur":2,"text":"which is you always want to impress your entrepreneurs."},"1919":{"dur":1,"text":"Right, and show them how smart you are."},"1920":{"dur":2,"text":"And so the problem is, when he names the three big flaws,"},"1923":{"dur":2,"text":"you're like, crap, he covered all my bases,"},"1926":{"dur":2,"text":"like, I don't know how to show off anymore."},"1928":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, the only thing that most investors end up doing then"},"1931":{"dur":1,"text":"is they're like, I'm gonna show him how smart I am"},"1933":{"dur":1,"text":"by solving all his problems."},"1935":{"dur":1,"text":"And so then they're like yeah, those first two problems"},"1937":{"dur":2,"text":"you pointed out, I could fix those in my sleep,"},"1939":{"dur":1,"text":"here's exactly how I would fix them."},"1941":{"dur":1,"text":"And then you end up talking yourself into the fact"},"1942":{"dur":1,"text":"that this startup is really great."},"1944":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I encourage some of you to give this a try,"},"1947":{"dur":1,"text":"I wouldn't say, like, here are all the reasons"},"1949":{"dur":2,"text":"you should never ever bet on me,"},"1951":{"dur":1,"text":"but I think it's totally reasonable"},"1952":{"dur":2,"text":"to walk into a pitch and say, look,"},"1955":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm excited about this idea."},"1956":{"dur":3,"text":"But I do think there are a few possible risks and issues,"},"1960":{"dur":1,"text":"here's what they are, I think the strengths"},"1961":{"dur":2,"text":"outweigh the limitations, and if you have ideas"},"1964":{"dur":1,"text":"on how to solve these, I would love"},"1965":{"dur":2,"text":"to talk with you about it."},"1967":{"dur":1,"text":"The one place where I probably wouldn't do this"},"1969":{"dur":1,"text":"is in a job interview."},"1972":{"dur":3,"text":"(audience laughing)"},"1977":{"dur":2,"text":"although some of you will remember George Costanza"},"1979":{"dur":2,"text":"saying, I'm unemployed and I live with my parents"},"1982":{"dur":2,"text":"as a great way to get hired by the New York Yankees."},"1985":{"dur":2,"text":"But, even there though, interestingly, in job interviews,"},"1988":{"dur":2,"text":"we have data that people are about 30%"},"1990":{"dur":3,"text":"more likely to get hired when they name honest weaknesses."},"1994":{"dur":2,"text":"As opposed to, you know, doing what most of us do,"},"1996":{"dur":1,"text":"and we're like, well, yeah,"},"1997":{"dur":3,"text":"I work too hard and I care too much."},"2001":{"dur":2,"text":"So take that for what it's worth."},"2004":{"dur":1,"text":"Fifth thing I wanted to highlight,"},"2005":{"dur":1,"text":"this is now to think about beyond"},"2006":{"dur":2,"text":"just recognizing and pitching your own ideas."},"2009":{"dur":1,"text":"How do you build a culture?"},"2010":{"dur":1,"text":"If you're a startup, if you're a team,"},"2012":{"dur":2,"text":"if you're a nonprofit, if you're a big company,"},"2015":{"dur":3,"text":"where people are likely to have lots of original ideas,"},"2019":{"dur":1,"text":"and bring them to the table effectively."},"2021":{"dur":2,"text":"I think hiring is huge for driving culture."},"2023":{"dur":1,"text":"Right, I think it's actually pretty difficult"},"2025":{"dur":2,"text":"to dramatically change people's values and their behaviors,"},"2028":{"dur":2,"text":"and the people you hire, what they already bring"},"2030":{"dur":1,"text":"to the table, are really critical drivers"},"2032":{"dur":2,"text":"of what the culture's all about."},"2034":{"dur":4,"text":"And, I think that a lot of founders mess this up."},"2050":{"dur":2,"text":"So just a quick gut check in the room."},"2052":{"dur":2,"text":"When you look at research on Silicon Valley founders,"},"2054":{"dur":1,"text":"you'll see that they tend to have three different blueprints"},"2056":{"dur":2,"text":"for what they like to hire on."},"2058":{"dur":2,"text":"Some say, I put skills first."},"2060":{"dur":2,"text":"My top priority is I've got a job description"},"2063":{"dur":2,"text":"and I want to know if you can do that stuff."},"2065":{"dur":1,"text":"Second say, yeah, it's nice to have people"},"2067":{"dur":1,"text":"who can do great things today,"},"2068":{"dur":1,"text":"but it's more important to know,"},"2070":{"dur":1,"text":"what's the ceiling on your potential?"},"2072":{"dur":1,"text":"And they try to hire stars."},"2073":{"dur":1,"text":"Who have a lot of learning agility,"},"2075":{"dur":1,"text":"or just raw intelligence."},"2077":{"dur":1,"text":"And the third approach is culture fit."},"2078":{"dur":1,"text":"To say yeah, I want skills and I want stars,"},"2080":{"dur":1,"text":"but to me that's a nonstarter"},"2082":{"dur":2,"text":"if you do not subscribe to our values."},"2085":{"dur":1,"text":"So of course you want all these things,"},"2086":{"dur":2,"text":"but if you have to choose one, which is most important?"},"2088":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's get a vote."},"2089":{"dur":2,"text":"How many of you put skills first?"},"2093":{"dur":1,"text":"(laughing) No one, okay."},"2094":{"dur":1,"text":"We're gonna have a bunch of incompetent startups."},"2096":{"dur":1,"text":"(audience laughing)"},"2098":{"dur":2,"text":"How many of you put stars first?"},"2100":{"dur":2,"text":"And how many of you, culture fit first?"},"2103":{"dur":2,"text":"Alright, so, again, study done right here at Stanford."},"2105":{"dur":2,"text":"Led by Jim Baron and Mike Hannan."},"2107":{"dur":2,"text":"What they show is that the firms where founders say"},"2110":{"dur":1,"text":"culture fit is my top priority,"},"2112":{"dur":2,"text":"are significantly less likely to fail."},"2115":{"dur":1,"text":"Significantly, and I wanted to quantify that,"},"2117":{"dur":1,"text":"but in the study, we look at"},"2118":{"dur":2,"text":"about 200 startups in this case,"},"2120":{"dur":3,"text":"zero percent was the failure rate for the culture fit firms."},"2124":{"dur":1,"text":"And then not only were they less likely to fail,"},"2126":{"dur":2,"text":"they were more likely to IPO, too."},"2128":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's easy to figure out why, right?"},"2130":{"dur":2,"text":"When you have culture fit, everybody subscribes"},"2133":{"dur":2,"text":"to the same values, they believe in the same mission,"},"2135":{"dur":2,"text":"and they are uniquely motivated,"},"2137":{"dur":0,"text":"because there's nowhere else"},"2138":{"dur":1,"text":"they would possibly want to work."},"2139":{"dur":1,"text":"And so they end up doing great things."},"2141":{"dur":0,"text":"And they're willing to do whatever it takes"},"2142":{"dur":1,"text":"to save the company."},"2144":{"dur":2,"text":"Except, after they go public,"},"2147":{"dur":3,"text":"the ones that hire on culture fit grow at the slowest rates"},"2150":{"dur":3,"text":"when you track measures like annual market capitalization."},"2153":{"dur":1,"text":"And so what got you there doesn't get you here,"},"2155":{"dur":3,"text":"culture fit seems to be good early but dangerous late."},"2158":{"dur":0,"text":"Why?"},"2160":{"dur":2,"text":"Well I think over time, culture fit sort of turns."},"2162":{"dur":1,"text":"Early on, you don't worry"},"2164":{"dur":2,"text":"about its negative effects as much,"},"2166":{"dur":2,"text":"because you usually have a disruptive idea."},"2169":{"dur":1,"text":"And you're trying to do something original,"},"2170":{"dur":1,"text":"and you need to be aligned on that."},"2172":{"dur":1,"text":"But as you grow, now you're dealing"},"2173":{"dur":2,"text":"with disruption from the outside, and the world is changing,"},"2175":{"dur":1,"text":"and you have to be able to adapt."},"2177":{"dur":2,"text":"And culture fit is code for hiring a bunch of people"},"2179":{"dur":2,"text":"who think the same way I do."},"2181":{"dur":1,"text":"And it leads to groupthink"},"2182":{"dur":2,"text":"and weeds out diversity of thought."},"2185":{"dur":2,"text":"So, IDEO has a great solution to this,"},"2187":{"dur":0,"text":"I think you all know them"},"2188":{"dur":2,"text":"as the world's greatest design firm,"},"2191":{"dur":3,"text":"when they started tackling this problem they realized"},"2194":{"dur":1,"text":"that instead of hiring on culture fit,"},"2196":{"dur":2,"text":"they should hire on cultural contribution."},"2198":{"dur":1,"text":"So instead of asking, what is our culture about,"},"2200":{"dur":2,"text":"and bringing in people who live those values,"},"2202":{"dur":1,"text":"they ask what's missing from our culture."},"2204":{"dur":1,"text":"And then they try to bring in people"},"2205":{"dur":2,"text":"who will enrich it and stretch it."},"2208":{"dur":2,"text":"So, they have a lot of great design thinkers, right,"},"2210":{"dur":2,"text":"many of whom come out of the d.school here,"},"2213":{"dur":2,"text":"and eventually they realized, you know,"},"2215":{"dur":1,"text":"we need more than just design thinkers."},"2217":{"dur":1,"text":"One of our challenges is, if we're gonna go"},"2219":{"dur":2,"text":"build a mouse for Apple or a new shopping cart"},"2221":{"dur":2,"text":"in a grocery store, we have to learn about"},"2223":{"dur":2,"text":"a very very foreign environment very quickly,"},"2225":{"dur":1,"text":"who's good at that?"},"2226":{"dur":1,"text":"And they say, anthropologists,"},"2228":{"dur":1,"text":"that's what they do for a living."},"2229":{"dur":1,"text":"They go in to, you know, foreign cultures,"},"2231":{"dur":1,"text":"and then they try to make sense of it."},"2233":{"dur":1,"text":"And they start hiring anthropologists"},"2234":{"dur":1,"text":"and they're like, this is amazing,"},"2236":{"dur":2,"text":"we should only hire anthropologists."},"2238":{"dur":0,"text":"(audience laughing)"},"2239":{"dur":0,"text":"And then they realize they're falling"},"2240":{"dur":0,"text":"into the same trap again,"},"2241":{"dur":3,"text":"so they say alright, how do we diversify again?"},"2244":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, once you understand a new world,"},"2246":{"dur":2,"text":"you've gotta translate that understanding back"},"2248":{"dur":3,"text":"to help your designers get it, and also your clients."},"2251":{"dur":1,"text":"And they say that's a storytelling skill."},"2253":{"dur":2,"text":"So now they start hiring more screenwriters and journalists."},"2256":{"dur":3,"text":"And again, it's tempting, we only want this kind of person."},"2259":{"dur":2,"text":"And the moment you find a skill or a background"},"2261":{"dur":1,"text":"that you think is uniquely great,"},"2263":{"dur":2,"text":"that's the moment that you need to think again"},"2265":{"dur":2,"text":"about what else is missing from your culture."},"2267":{"dur":1,"text":"And that seems to be a great antidote"},"2269":{"dur":1,"text":"to this culture fit problem."},"2271":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I think that what a lot of us end up doing, sadly,"},"2274":{"dur":3,"text":"when we hire, is we not only think about culture fit,"},"2278":{"dur":1,"text":"we think about me-fit."},"2279":{"dur":1,"text":"I always think when I'm trying to hire originals"},"2281":{"dur":1,"text":"that this is what I'm looking for."},"2283":{"dur":3,"text":"(audience laughing)"},"2292":{"dur":2,"text":"But, for those of you who are building teams"},"2294":{"dur":2,"text":"or interviewing people for clubs or anything like that,"},"2297":{"dur":1,"text":"one of my favorite things to do"},"2298":{"dur":2,"text":"is to start at the bottom of a resume."},"2300":{"dur":1,"text":"Because, that's when you start to see"},"2302":{"dur":2,"text":"people's unconventional experiences,"},"2304":{"dur":2,"text":"interesting backgrounds and hobbies and skills,"},"2307":{"dur":1,"text":"and the other thing you can do,"},"2308":{"dur":2,"text":"is when you chat with them, just make your last question,"},"2311":{"dur":2,"text":"how would you improve our interview process?"},"2314":{"dur":2,"text":"And then wait to see how many creative ideas they have"},"2316":{"dur":2,"text":"for how to hire differently, and they've just been through"},"2318":{"dur":1,"text":"that process themselves so,"},"2320":{"dur":1,"text":"they oughta have something to bring to the table."},"2322":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's kind of a neat way to get"},"2323":{"dur":1,"text":"a quick window into their ability"},"2325":{"dur":2,"text":"to think originally on the spot."},"2327":{"dur":2,"text":"Last thing I want to say before we open up for questions,"},"2330":{"dur":2,"text":"is, I think obviously it's nice to make sure"},"2332":{"dur":2,"text":"that you don't end up with this culture fit problem."},"2335":{"dur":1,"text":"But you still have to manage it."},"2336":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's huge pressure"},"2338":{"dur":2,"text":"toward groupthink in organizations."},"2340":{"dur":1,"text":"Bob has actually written a whole book on this"},"2341":{"dur":2,"text":"called Weird Ideas That Work,"},"2344":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's one of the greatest books I've ever read."},"2347":{"dur":2,"text":"It has a ton of insight about how to fight groupthink,"},"2349":{"dur":2,"text":"highly recommend reading it if you haven't already."},"2351":{"dur":2,"text":"But one of the things that I was motivated to do"},"2353":{"dur":3,"text":"after reading his work was to go around"},"2356":{"dur":2,"text":"to different organizations and take pictures of leaders"},"2358":{"dur":3,"text":"who were not listening to other people's ideas."},"2362":{"dur":4,"text":"And this is my all-time favorite one that I snapped."},"2366":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that it's really sad"},"2368":{"dur":2,"text":"that a lot of leaders have good intentions,"},"2370":{"dur":1,"text":"and they don't realize they're shutting people down"},"2372":{"dur":1,"text":"when they say stuff like this."},"2374":{"dur":2,"text":"So think of a boss you had at some point"},"2376":{"dur":1,"text":"who uttered this phrase, I'm gonna ask you all"},"2377":{"dur":1,"text":"to shout it out loud, ready?"},"2379":{"dur":0,"text":"Don't bring me,"},"2380":{"dur":0,"text":"- [Some Audience Members] Problems."},"2381":{"dur":0,"text":"- [Presenter] Bring me,"},"2382":{"dur":0,"text":"- [More Audience Members] Solutions."},"2383":{"dur":1,"text":"- That was pretty good."},"2385":{"dur":1,"text":"I get the idea behind this, right?"},"2386":{"dur":3,"text":"You want people to, you know, not just be complaining,"},"2389":{"dur":2,"text":"you want them to be constructive."},"2391":{"dur":2,"text":"But if you can only bring problems, or excuse me,"},"2394":{"dur":2,"text":"solutions to the table, then people never speak up"},"2396":{"dur":1,"text":"about the hardest problems."},"2398":{"dur":2,"text":"That they don't know how to solve yet."},"2400":{"dur":1,"text":"And when they do know how to solve them,"},"2402":{"dur":1,"text":"you only then get a culture of advocacy"},"2404":{"dur":1,"text":"instead of one of inquiry,"},"2405":{"dur":1,"text":"where people figure out the solution"},"2407":{"dur":1,"text":"and they're like, my job is to ram that solution"},"2409":{"dur":1,"text":"down everybody else's throat."},"2410":{"dur":2,"text":"As opposed to, find out what everybody's ideas are,"},"2413":{"dur":2,"text":"and then bring those to the table."},"2416":{"dur":1,"text":"So I actually love to see organizations"},"2417":{"dur":3,"text":"just accept problems with no solutions."},"2420":{"dur":3,"text":"Warby Parker has gone so far as to create a Google doc,"},"2424":{"dur":1,"text":"where they literally have people submit"},"2425":{"dur":2,"text":"all the problems they see whenever they catch them."},"2428":{"dur":1,"text":"Managers review them weekly,"},"2429":{"dur":1,"text":"and vote on which ones are important,"},"2431":{"dur":1,"text":"and if you want to fix one of them,"},"2432":{"dur":2,"text":"you can just add that to your job description."},"2435":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's a great way to maintain visibility"},"2436":{"dur":1,"text":"into what's not working, but also,"},"2438":{"dur":2,"text":"what kinds of issues demand creativity."},"2440":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think we ought to have more of that,"},"2442":{"dur":2,"text":"and one thing I'll recommend in closing,"},"2445":{"dur":1,"text":"is an exercise that I learned about"},"2446":{"dur":1,"text":"at a pharma company a few years ago."},"2448":{"dur":2,"text":"So the CEO got really frustrated that everybody"},"2451":{"dur":2,"text":"was sort of stuck in very bureaucratic thinking."},"2454":{"dur":2,"text":"And he said, I want you to spend the next hour,"},"2456":{"dur":1,"text":"this is his whole executive team,"},"2458":{"dur":3,"text":"we're gonna spend the next hour trying to kill our company."},"2461":{"dur":1,"text":"Imagine that you're our biggest competitor,"},"2463":{"dur":1,"text":"and just try to put us out of business."},"2465":{"dur":1,"text":"How would you do it?"},"2466":{"dur":2,"text":"I have never seen a more energized group of executives"},"2469":{"dur":0,"text":"in my life."},"2470":{"dur":0,"text":"(audience laughing)"},"2471":{"dur":1,"text":"right, like, there was a scientist who said,"},"2472":{"dur":2,"text":"I've been waiting 27 years to destroy this company,"},"2475":{"dur":3,"text":"thank you for finally giving me the floor."},"2478":{"dur":2,"text":"But, after that, they had to turn around and ask,"},"2481":{"dur":1,"text":"well, what would you do now?"},"2482":{"dur":2,"text":"Like, some of these ideas are competitive threats,"},"2485":{"dur":1,"text":"others are real opportunities."},"2487":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think this is a great exercise for two reasons,"},"2489":{"dur":1,"text":"one is that it really makes it safe"},"2491":{"dur":1,"text":"for everyone to speak up."},"2493":{"dur":1,"text":"Because if your job is to kill the company,"},"2494":{"dur":1,"text":"there is nothing that you can't say,"},"2496":{"dur":2,"text":"and two, it makes people much more likely"},"2499":{"dur":1,"text":"to think creatively."},"2500":{"dur":2,"text":"Because if you do this exercise as save the company,"},"2503":{"dur":3,"text":"you come up with a bunch of very risk-averse cautious ideas."},"2506":{"dur":2,"text":"Whereas when people are on offense,"},"2509":{"dur":1,"text":"to try to destroy a company,"},"2510":{"dur":2,"text":"they're much more willing to try some crazy possibilities."},"2512":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you haven't tried this out, I highly recommend it."},"2515":{"dur":1,"text":"So look, I have a simple goal,"},"2516":{"dur":1,"text":"I want to create more organizations"},"2518":{"dur":2,"text":"where originality thrives."},"2520":{"dur":2,"text":"And I hope you all will help me do that."},"2522":{"dur":0,"text":"Thank you."},"2523":{"dur":3,"text":"(audience applauding)"},"2532":{"dur":3,"text":"So I would love to take some questions,"},"2535":{"dur":0,"text":"if you have one raise your hand,"},"2536":{"dur":1,"text":"if not I will cold-call."},"2538":{"dur":1,"text":"(audience laughing)"},"2540":{"dur":0,"text":"Yes."},"2541":{"dur":0,"text":"- [Woman] You spoke about making"},"2542":{"dur":1,"text":"the unfamiliar familiar."},"2544":{"dur":1,"text":"So, when you join a new company,"},"2546":{"dur":3,"text":"does that imply that you should wait for some time,"},"2549":{"dur":2,"text":"establish your credibility, and then kind of,"},"2552":{"dur":2,"text":"is that a part of becoming more familiar?"},"2554":{"dur":1,"text":"- That's a really great question to start."},"2555":{"dur":2,"text":"So the question is, in a nutshell,"},"2558":{"dur":2,"text":"when you have to establish familiarity,"},"2560":{"dur":2,"text":"should you then wait and kind of get to know a company"},"2562":{"dur":3,"text":"first before, you know, maybe challenging the status quo."},"2566":{"dur":3,"text":"I think a lot of it depends on how much political capital"},"2569":{"dur":1,"text":"you're willing to expend,"},"2570":{"dur":1,"text":"and how many risks you're willing to take."},"2572":{"dur":2,"text":"The advice that I give to my students pretty frequently"},"2574":{"dur":2,"text":"is that they should get in the habit of advice-seeking."},"2577":{"dur":2,"text":"So instead of just going and pitching your ideas right away,"},"2579":{"dur":1,"text":"what you do is, you go to your boss"},"2581":{"dur":1,"text":"or somebody else who's volunteered"},"2583":{"dur":3,"text":"to do a little bit of mentoring, or helping with onboarding."},"2586":{"dur":1,"text":"And you say hey, I have a couple of these ideas,"},"2588":{"dur":1,"text":"I would love your suggestions on,"},"2589":{"dur":1,"text":"are these worth considering, are there other people"},"2591":{"dur":1,"text":"I should talk to about them?"},"2593":{"dur":2,"text":"And the great thing is then, like instead of,"},"2595":{"dur":1,"text":"instead of being in a pitch situation,"},"2597":{"dur":2,"text":"you're now in a situation where you're asking somebody else"},"2599":{"dur":2,"text":"to support you a little bit."},"2601":{"dur":1,"text":"And the first thing that will happen is,"},"2603":{"dur":2,"text":"you tend to flatter the person that you're asking."},"2606":{"dur":2,"text":"To paraphrase Benjamin Franklin, we all admire the wisdom"},"2609":{"dur":2,"text":"of people who come to us for advice."},"2611":{"dur":1,"text":"Right, let's face it, they have really good taste,"},"2612":{"dur":2,"text":"they knew to come to me."},"2615":{"dur":2,"text":"And then secondly you force perspective taking."},"2617":{"dur":2,"text":"They have to walk in your shoes in order to give you advice."},"2619":{"dur":1,"text":"And usually, those two things together"},"2621":{"dur":1,"text":"lead people to say like, alright,"},"2622":{"dur":2,"text":"here's where I think this idea might have promise,"},"2625":{"dur":1,"text":"why don't you go talk to these people,"},"2627":{"dur":1,"text":"or best case scenario, I'll step up"},"2628":{"dur":1,"text":"and become your advocate."},"2630":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think that's a, that's just a soft way"},"2631":{"dur":1,"text":"to start socializing your ideas,"},"2633":{"dur":1,"text":"that protects you against risk,"},"2634":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's kinda where I would start."},"2636":{"dur":1,"text":"But I do, I do stand with that,"},"2638":{"dur":1,"text":"with Francis Ford Coppola, who said that,"},"2640":{"dur":1,"text":"sometimes you shouldn't just try"},"2641":{"dur":2,"text":"to change the establishment from day one,"},"2644":{"dur":1,"text":"instead sometimes you should make a place"},"2646":{"dur":2,"text":"in the establishment, and then once you're at the top,"},"2648":{"dur":1,"text":"double-cross them."},"2650":{"dur":1,"text":"Who's our next victim?"},"2652":{"dur":1,"text":"Way in the back."},"2653":{"dur":3,"text":"- [Light-Voiced Woman] You talked about harness anxiety."},"2656":{"dur":3,"text":"But how would you apply to yourself,"},"2660":{"dur":3,"text":"for example you took kind of a big risk,"},"2663":{"dur":1,"text":"and you say oh, I'm excited,"},"2664":{"dur":2,"text":"but actually it's not within your head,"},"2666":{"dur":2,"text":"like the outcome is just there,"},"2668":{"dur":2,"text":"and you just cannot do anything about it."},"2671":{"dur":1,"text":"Pretty much."},"2672":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yeah, I dunno, I just study this stuff, right?"},"2675":{"dur":4,"text":"So, good luck. (audience laughing)"},"2679":{"dur":4,"text":"No, I, so I think, look, this is a fundamental challenge."},"2683":{"dur":3,"text":"So oftentimes, we're anxious because we're underprepared."},"2687":{"dur":1,"text":"Right, or because, like, there's a real reason"},"2689":{"dur":2,"text":"to be concerned about who we're speaking up to."},"2691":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think the only thing you can do from that"},"2693":{"dur":1,"text":"is learn from it."},"2694":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'll tell you what I ended up doing,"},"2696":{"dur":3,"text":"which is, I was terrified of my boss's boss after that,"},"2699":{"dur":2,"text":"and I literally, I hid in the men's bathroom"},"2701":{"dur":1,"text":"for a couple days."},"2703":{"dur":1,"text":"(audience laughing)"},"2704":{"dur":2,"text":"To make sure that she wouldn't fire me."},"2706":{"dur":1,"text":"But eventually I worked up the courage"},"2708":{"dur":2,"text":"to go to her and say look, that suggestion I made"},"2710":{"dur":1,"text":"obviously did not go well."},"2712":{"dur":2,"text":"I'd like to learn to avoid that in the future."},"2715":{"dur":2,"text":"And, is there advice you could give me about,"},"2717":{"dur":2,"text":"if I were gonna come to you and have this conversation,"},"2720":{"dur":2,"text":"how should I have brought it up differently?"},"2723":{"dur":2,"text":"And she actually gave me some suggestions,"},"2725":{"dur":1,"text":"and then fired me."},"2726":{"dur":1,"text":"No I'm just kidding."},"2727":{"dur":0,"text":"(audience laughing)"},"2728":{"dur":3,"text":"But I think that so often we shy away from seeking feedback,"},"2731":{"dur":3,"text":"especially on the very people who have criticized us."},"2735":{"dur":1,"text":"There's some research that Francesca Gino"},"2736":{"dur":2,"text":"just published recently, showing that"},"2739":{"dur":1,"text":"when people give us negative feedback"},"2740":{"dur":2,"text":"we tend to drop them from our lives."},"2743":{"dur":1,"text":"Because, it's really uncomfortable,"},"2744":{"dur":1,"text":"nobody likes to look in the mirror"},"2745":{"dur":2,"text":"and see somebody incompetent staring back at them."},"2748":{"dur":1,"text":"But I think the people that have been hard on us"},"2750":{"dur":2,"text":"are exactly the people we should go back to and learn from."},"2753":{"dur":1,"text":"At minimum, right, we won't screw up as badly"},"2754":{"dur":2,"text":"the next time we have to confront them."},"2756":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's kind of how I've,"},"2758":{"dur":1,"text":"I guess I thought about that over time."},"2759":{"dur":0,"text":"- [Man] One more."},"2760":{"dur":0,"text":"- One more question."},"2761":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes, right over here."},"2762":{"dur":0,"text":"- [Deep-Voiced Man] So in your book,"},"2763":{"dur":1,"text":"you give the example of the,"},"2765":{"dur":2,"text":"I think it was an NSA or a CIA analyst?"},"2768":{"dur":0,"text":"- [Deep-Voiced Man] Yes, exactly."},"2769":{"dur":2,"text":"So, can you talk about the difference between"},"2772":{"dur":3,"text":"somebody who's in the public sector and private sector?"},"2775":{"dur":0,"text":"- Yes."},"2777":{"dur":1,"text":"(audience laughing)"},"2779":{"dur":3,"text":"Yeah, look, so, I've spent a bunch of my career"},"2784":{"dur":2,"text":"trying to figure out what public-private differences"},"2787":{"dur":1,"text":"are real on average."},"2789":{"dur":1,"text":"So one of the biggest differences"},"2790":{"dur":1,"text":"that has good data behind it is,"},"2792":{"dur":1,"text":"there's a greater motivation to be of service"},"2793":{"dur":4,"text":"in the public sector, for reasons that will shock no one."},"2797":{"dur":4,"text":"Because of that, I always thought it would be easier then,"},"2802":{"dur":2,"text":"to pitch ideas in a public than private organization."},"2805":{"dur":1,"text":"Obviously I was wrong."},"2806":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think the reason is that people often believe"},"2809":{"dur":2,"text":"that they're doing really important meaningful work"},"2811":{"dur":2,"text":"that's helping, right, so it's harder to criticize them,"},"2813":{"dur":1,"text":"whereas in the private sector, if you're failing,"},"2815":{"dur":2,"text":"everybody knows it already."},"2817":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think that that often makes it harder"},"2819":{"dur":1,"text":"to speak up in organizations,"},"2821":{"dur":2,"text":"not just because they have more bureaucracy."},"2823":{"dur":2,"text":"But also because there's a zeal around the mission."},"2826":{"dur":2,"text":"And you have to be really careful about that."},"2828":{"dur":1,"text":"I spent the past few months working"},"2830":{"dur":4,"text":"with the Pentagon on the Defense Innovation Board."},"2834":{"dur":1,"text":"And trying to figure out how to take a military"},"2836":{"dur":3,"text":"that doesn't do a huge amount of innovation"},"2839":{"dur":3,"text":"across lots of different parts of this complex organization,"},"2843":{"dur":2,"text":"and figure out, where would you start?"},"2845":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think that probably the biggest thing that I learned"},"2849":{"dur":2,"text":"is actually something that Chip and Dan Heath"},"2852":{"dur":1,"text":"wrote about in their book, Switch."},"2853":{"dur":1,"text":"Which is an amazing book on change."},"2855":{"dur":1,"text":"What they basically said is look,"},"2856":{"dur":2,"text":"no matter how backward an organization is,"},"2858":{"dur":1,"text":"there are always bright spots."},"2860":{"dur":2,"text":"And, your job is to find the bright spots."},"2863":{"dur":0,"text":"And so one of the things we've been doing"},"2864":{"dur":1,"text":"is we go around to different Air Force"},"2866":{"dur":2,"text":"and Army and Navy bases, is asking,"},"2868":{"dur":2,"text":"who are the most innovative people around here?"},"2870":{"dur":1,"text":"And what you find is, everywhere, there's somebody"},"2872":{"dur":2,"text":"who's broken rules and gotten away with it."},"2874":{"dur":1,"text":"Right, and then the question is how did they do it,"},"2876":{"dur":1,"text":"and who are there allies, and then"},"2878":{"dur":2,"text":"we want to try to build a network to bring them together."},"2880":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think that that's valuable in the private sector"},"2883":{"dur":2,"text":"of course, but maybe even more so in the public sector."},"2885":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's one thing that jumps out for me."},"2888":{"dur":1,"text":"With that, it's been a huge honor"},"2889":{"dur":2,"text":"to share ideas with you this afternoon."},"2891":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm told there are future talks to come."},"2893":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you for having me."},"2895":{"dur":3,"text":"(audience applauding)"}}
