corner."},"10":{"dur":2,"text":"One of my favourite things about the job that\nI do"},"13":{"dur":5,"text":"as the curator of the Iron Age collections\nis that I get to share with all of you guys"},"18":{"dur":2,"text":"the things that I know and that I've gradually\nbeen learning"},"21":{"dur":4,"text":"about all of the incredible objects that are\nin the collections of the British Museum."},"26":{"dur":3,"text":"Particularly Iron Age and Roman gold and silver\nworking"},"29":{"dur":4,"text":"and some of the objects that I was interested\nin learning about how they were made"},"34":{"dur":3,"text":"are torcs or big metal neck rings like this\none."},"37":{"dur":6,"text":"I'm able to pick this one up in my hands and\nbe quite relaxed with it"},"43":{"dur":2,"text":"because this isn't part of our collection,"},"45":{"dur":2,"text":"this is actually an object which I made."},"47":{"dur":5,"text":"And I wanted to learn about what was needed\nif you're starting from first principles"},"53":{"dur":2,"text":"to make a neck ring like this."},"55":{"dur":7,"text":"And this one is just about the simplest kind\nof torc that you can get."},"63":{"dur":4,"text":"I wanted to be able to demonstrate for you\nhow I made it,"},"67":{"dur":8,"text":"it took quite a long time and I started with\ncasting a bar of bronze."},"75":{"dur":1,"text":"The Iron Age ones tend to be made of gold\nand silver,"},"77":{"dur":3,"text":"but it turns out that those are quite expensive\nmetals to work with,"},"81":{"dur":0,"text":"particularly if you're just beginning."},"82":{"dur":3,"text":"So I went with bronze, cheaper alternative,"},"85":{"dur":2,"text":"though actually slighter harder to work with,"},"87":{"dur":3,"text":"it's a much stiffer metal and harder to forge."},"91":{"dur":1,"text":"So you cast out an ingot"},"92":{"dur":2,"text":"and once that's cooled down"},"95":{"dur":5,"text":"then you hammer it into a long thick piece\nof wire or rod."},"100":{"dur":1,"text":"And then forged out we think"},"102":{"dur":3,"text":"with a square section so you can hammer down\none side,"},"105":{"dur":2,"text":"rotate, hammer down the other side,"},"107":{"dur":1,"text":"rotate, hammer down the other side,"},"109":{"dur":5,"text":"until you're gradually forging out this square\npiece of wire."},"115":{"dur":2,"text":"One of the things that this made me realise,"},"117":{"dur":5,"text":"is how incredibly difficult it is to make\nwire by hand in this way"},"123":{"dur":3,"text":"and I may have given up in the end"},"127":{"dur":2,"text":"and done some of this iron making on a rolling\nmill,"},"130":{"dur":1,"text":"which they wouldn't of had in the Iron Age"},"131":{"dur":2,"text":"because its a very very labour intensive task"},"134":{"dur":6,"text":"and I think it really made me realise, all\nof these things are not one person jobs,"},"140":{"dur":3,"text":"so everything from smelting that copper,"},"144":{"dur":3,"text":"where you've got to be keeping your bellows\ngoing for a very very long time"},"147":{"dur":2,"text":"to maintaining the furnace,"},"149":{"dur":2,"text":"keeping all of the charcoal ready and to hand"},"152":{"dur":4,"text":"and keeping your temperatures ready for working\nobjects like this."},"156":{"dur":4,"text":"And doing all of that hammering to make very\nvery large quantities of very very standard"},"161":{"dur":0,"text":"wire,"},"162":{"dur":2,"text":"some of these are quite easy jobs, some are\nvery skilled jobs"},"164":{"dur":3,"text":"but all of them are jobs that would require\nquite a large number of people"},"168":{"dur":4,"text":"to actually be able to produce several different\nobjects."},"172":{"dur":3,"text":"The next step once you have a piece like this,"},"175":{"dur":1,"text":"you need to have two pieces"},"177":{"dur":7,"text":"and so the first thing to do then, is to bend\nthe ends of each one round in to a loop,"},"184":{"dur":4,"text":"by taking your thicker rod and hammering it\nover something called a mandrel,"},"189":{"dur":4,"text":"which is a kind of conical piece that you\ncan hammer on to."},"194":{"dur":8,"text":"So I'm just bending that round into two little\nloops at the end"},"202":{"dur":5,"text":"and these are going to make the kind of loops\nthat we see on the finished torc terminal"},"208":{"dur":0,"text":"there."},"209":{"dur":7,"text":"Ok, so we've more or less got one"},"216":{"dur":2,"text":"and another one that I made earlier,"},"219":{"dur":4,"text":"so you then take these, these are not particularly\nwell matched"},"224":{"dur":1,"text":"but hopefully you'll get the idea."},"226":{"dur":3,"text":"And the next step in making this is to clamp\ntogether"},"229":{"dur":2,"text":"two of those opposing loops,"},"231":{"dur":5,"text":"so you can start to see how those are going\nto become those there"},"237":{"dur":1,"text":"on a much larger scale."},"239":{"dur":2,"text":"And the next thing to do would be to twist\nthis,"},"241":{"dur":1,"text":"and by twisting and twisting and twisting,"},"243":{"dur":3,"text":"those pair terminals there together,"},"246":{"dur":3,"text":"you gradually build up a twist which runs\nall the way down the wires."},"250":{"dur":1,"text":"So once you've put the twist in,"},"251":{"dur":4,"text":"the next thing to do is just very simply to\nbend the torc round"},"255":{"dur":2,"text":"and you can see then that you end up with\nsomething like this."},"258":{"dur":3,"text":"We don't know a huge amount about how they\nwere worn or who wore them"},"262":{"dur":4,"text":"because in Britain in particular we don't\nhave very many graves from the Iron Age"},"266":{"dur":3,"text":"and so we don't have burials with people wearing\ntorcs."},"270":{"dur":3,"text":"When we do find torcs like this, they tend\nto be found in hoards"},"273":{"dur":4,"text":"and this means that we just get a big group\nof objects like this,"},"277":{"dur":3,"text":"perhaps pieces of ancient jewelry, pieces\nof metal working waste"},"281":{"dur":3,"text":"and pieces of chopped up items like this deposited\ntogether in a pit."},"284":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's where a lot of the material from\nSnettisham in Norfolk"},"288":{"dur":3,"text":"where the torc that I based this one on comes\nfrom."},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"So that kind of information by itself"},"293":{"dur":3,"text":"and we can look at the objects and say that\nthey were worn,"},"297":{"dur":3,"text":"but we can't say who wore them or whether\nthey were worn only for special occasions"},"300":{"dur":2,"text":"or whether even they were worn everyday."},"303":{"dur":3,"text":"Some of the torcs that we have I think probably\nwere not for everyday wear."},"307":{"dur":5,"text":"I've explained that I've based my replica\non the simplest torc that you can get,"},"312":{"dur":3,"text":"but I have another replica which I would like\nto show you,"},"315":{"dur":4,"text":"which is a little bit more complex and not\none that I made."},"319":{"dur":3,"text":"This is an electrotype of the Snettisham great\ntorc,"},"323":{"dur":1,"text":"so it's from the same site."},"324":{"dur":2,"text":"Rather than being made up as mine was"},"327":{"dur":3,"text":"of just two twisted together large thick wires,"},"331":{"dur":5,"text":"this is made up of sixty four strands of gold\nalloy wire"},"336":{"dur":3,"text":"and that created this incredible neck ring."},"340":{"dur":3,"text":"And at the ends here, what we call the terminals"},"343":{"dur":3,"text":"you can see these are incredibly complex,"},"347":{"dur":3,"text":"and they've been directly casted on to the\nends of the wire"},"351":{"dur":3,"text":"and in this particular one, as I've said it's\nan electrotype"},"354":{"dur":2,"text":"so here this ends have actually been soldered\non,"},"357":{"dur":4,"text":"but on the original, our scientists here at\nthe museum have studied it"},"361":{"dur":5,"text":"and they've realised that actually this part\nof the terminal was cast directly on to the"},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"ends"},"368":{"dur":5,"text":"and this here being added as a little collar\nto cover up that join."},"373":{"dur":3,"text":"And the way that you would have to go about\ncasting something like that on,"},"376":{"dur":5,"text":"so if i wanted to cast on a more decorative\nterminal to the one that I made,"},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"I would put something like a material like\nwax"},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"which could be melted a way on to the terminals"},"387":{"dur":4,"text":"and I would mould it up and carve it into\nthe shape that I wanted the final terminal"},"392":{"dur":1,"text":"to take."},"393":{"dur":4,"text":"And then around that wax I would pack clay\nwith little funnels"},"397":{"dur":4,"text":"into which I can pour metal as that's going\nto happen in a moment"},"401":{"dur":3,"text":"and a little hole for the wax to escape from,"},"404":{"dur":5,"text":"you then heat up that whole mould and the\nwax drains out, it melts with the heat"},"410":{"dur":3,"text":"leaving a void where you want to have that\nmetal go in."},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"You then have your molten metal in a crucible"},"416":{"dur":4,"text":"and you can pour that into the mould that\nyou have created,"},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"when you then break away the clay mould"},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"you will have on there the terminal that you\nwanted to cast on."},"427":{"dur":6,"text":"This is an incredibly complicated process\nand it can go wrong quite easily,"},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"not necessarily because you done something\nvery wrong"},"435":{"dur":5,"text":"but just because its quite a tricky process\nto get right."},"440":{"dur":3,"text":"If you imagine trying to cast on something\nas complicated"},"444":{"dur":4,"text":"as that terminal on to all of this incredibly\nprecious wire"},"449":{"dur":4,"text":"that would have been really daunting and quite\na daring thing to do."},"453":{"dur":5,"text":"I used to be, when I first looked at this\nobject, I've always thought it was a brilliant"},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"it's one of the real star pieces in our Iron\nAge gallery,"},"463":{"dur":4,"text":"I always just used to look at the terminals\nand I used to look at this decoration,"},"467":{"dur":3,"text":"this fabulous engraving that you can see on\nhere,"},"470":{"dur":5,"text":"and this is an example of what today we quite\noften call Celtic art or La T\u00e8ne art."},"476":{"dur":4,"text":"But now that I've done some actual metal working,"},"480":{"dur":6,"text":"the thing that I really look at most now when\nI see this object is all of this wire"},"486":{"dur":4,"text":"because for me it was so difficult, physically\ntaxing"},"491":{"dur":7,"text":"and very very difficult to get the very simple,\nvery thick wire that I made to be even"},"499":{"dur":3,"text":"and to look nice."},"502":{"dur":6,"text":"The idea of creating this much wire, hammering\nit all out by hand"},"508":{"dur":7,"text":"and making it so accurately refined and so\nstanderised across the entire length,"},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"to me that's absolutely incredible"},"518":{"dur":6,"text":"and I think that its quite easy to look at\nsomething like that now and it looks quite"},"524":{"dur":1,"text":"simple and quite rope like"},"526":{"dur":5,"text":"and we can forget all of the hours and hours\nof work that must of gone into making it,"},"531":{"dur":4,"text":"so for me that was something really important\nthat I got from actually making things"},"535":{"dur":4,"text":"was realising what goes into this from first\nprinciples"},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"and not just taking the finished object for\ngranted,"},"543":{"dur":4,"text":"but thinking about the people who made these\nobjects and what it must of meant for them"},"548":{"dur":18,"text":"and also to wear and to use them as well."}}
