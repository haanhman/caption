well."},"96":{"dur":1,"text":"More than enough for a lession plan."},"98":{"dur":1,"text":"What we're gonna do now,"},"99":{"dur":1,"text":"is have a go at the same targets,"},"102":{"dur":2,"text":"but we're going to do from the level of the field over there."},"105":{"dur":1,"text":"it's 200 metres,"},"107":{"dur":2,"text":"obviously we're not going to be\nstanding off sticks to do the job"},"109":{"dur":3,"text":"just on the grass bank over there, it's 200 metres."},"113":{"dur":3,"text":"We'll be using the prone position from\nthere, I will show

forwards."},"136":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, if you think about where we were\nbefore,"},"140":{"dur":2,"text":"we've got a situation here, where we'll do a bit of range

good idea to shoot them off sticks?"},"152":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't think so, not really no."},"154":{"dur":2,"text":"So what we need to do is find a stable shooting position."},"158":{"dur":1,"text":"We're going to have a look around on\nthe grass here."},"160":{"dur":2,"text":"Somewhere there, seems to be okay, it's relatively laid

there."},"183":{"dur":0,"text":"Okay Cai,"},"185":{"dur":1,"text":"picking it up, properly sorted out now,"},"188":{"dur":3,"text":"we need a good shooting position, we need the rifle set at the right range."},"193":{"dur":2,"text":"We need to pick a moment when the animals not about to walk off."},"197":{"dur":3,"text":"Obviously you've got to study deer for a long time to know when that moment

right,"},"217":{"dur":2,"text":"I want you to aim at the left edge of the killzone of the deer."},"220":{"dur":0,"text":"Yeah,"},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"At nine o'clock on the kill zone, not off it."},"223":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay, you ready?"},"225":{"dur":0,"text":"Spotting."},"231":{"dur":0,"text":"Excellent."},"232":{"dur":0,"text":"Perfect for wind."},"233":{"dur":1,"text":"Just on top of the kill zone."},"235":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll give it one just for the heck of it."},"238":{"dur":0,"text":"Firing."},"247":{"dur":2,"text":"I aimed in the middle, you can see there,"},"249":{"dur":1,"text":"that the winds actually gone off"},"252":{"dur":0,"text":"about two inches."},"255":{"dur":2,"text":"Just to give you an example of what the\nsituation is with the wind."},"259":{"dur":1,"text":"You've got to account for the stuff."},"261":{"dur":0,"text":"You aimed in,"},"262":{"dur":3,"text":"got the shot on, I aimed smack in the middle of the kill zone"},"266":{"dur":5,"text":"and my shot just about two-three inches to the right of where I wanted to it to be."},"272":{"dur":2,"text":"Always be aware at these ranges wind\nmatters."},"281":{"dur":2,"text":"Absolutely smack in the middle brilliant."},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going to on on the left edge at nine o'clock."},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"You can see the same thing again, we're both in the kill zone."},"294":{"dur":1,"text":"we both accounted for the wind."},"296":{"dur":1,"text":"It's quite choppy and changable,"},"298":{"dur":1,"text":"there's quite a lot of differences in the wind."},"301":{"dur":1,"text":"We need to get in the kill zone."},"302":{"dur":1,"text":"We don't want to be blown out the wrong side of it."},"306":{"dur":1,"text":"Great shot, firing."},"311":{"dur":1,"text":"Right on top of your mark."},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"I was aiming at the left edge of the\nkill zone, where were you aiming?"},"316":{"dur":1,"text":"Left edge of the kill zone."},"318":{"dur":1,"text":"So you can see 200 metres,"},"320":{"dur":3,"text":"we're dealing with at least 10 possibly\n12 centimetres of wind."},"325":{"dur":1,"text":"it's quite a lesson in shooting isn't it?"},"327":{"dur":0,"text":"It is indeed, yes."},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"And people talk about shooting deer at\n300 don't they?"},"332":{"dur":1,"text":"They do indeed."},"333":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, let's give it a go and see what\nhappens today okay?"},"336":{"dur":0,"text":"Yep, sounds good."},"341":{"dur":0,"text":"How did you think that went?"},"343":{"dur":1,"text":"I thought that went really well actually,"},"344":{"dur":1,"text":"good I'm glad your pleased."},"346":{"dur":3,"text":"I'll tell you what, it's interesting to see how difference the actual wind makes."},"351":{"dur":1,"text":"A lot of people reckon their rifle shoots flat"},"353":{"dur":1,"text":"or it's not affected by wind."},"355":{"dur":4,"text":"Both the 243 and the 308 and this is only a 4-6 mile an hour wind,"},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"we're being pushed off two to four\ninches to the right at that range."},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"You saw that shot, I didn't allocate through"},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"I could see the difference, you could see it just out of the kill zone,"},"370":{"dur":1,"text":"Again, not the game dealers best friend,"},"372":{"dur":1,"text":"it bit more and it could have been very messy."},"375":{"dur":0,"text":"Okay,"},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"We've done 100 off the\nsticks,"},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"we've done 70 off the sticks, we've done 100 off the sticks, we've done standing,"},"382":{"dur":0,"text":"we've done kneeling."},"383":{"dur":1,"text":"We've tried a bit of prone here at 200."},"386":{"dur":1,"text":"now a lot of people,"},"388":{"dur":1,"text":"never get to shoot more than 150-200,"},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"actually it's got a pulse is a reason\nfor getting that close."},"394":{"dur":2,"text":"What do you reckon we have a go at 300?"},"397":{"dur":1,"text":"And we see what happens"},"399":{"dur":3,"text":"what you could do if you had a wounded\nbeast that had ran out that extra 100 or something like that."},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"Or need to clear up a problem."},"405":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah, I think we should give that a go."},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, lets see what effect the winds going to be doing further on that."},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah, and we can look at holdover and also maybe dialing."},"415":{"dur":1,"text":"Lets pack away and we'll get off."},"420":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay, Cai here we are"},"422":{"dur":3,"text":"along way away, don't try this on an un-wounded animal."},"426":{"dur":1,"text":"We're shooting at the Roe Deer,"},"428":{"dur":1,"text":"because that's what we happen to be sent up on."},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"Have you ever had a gilly carry a matt up a Scotish hill for you?"},"433":{"dur":3,"text":"Never, it won't happen after this."},"437":{"dur":0,"text":"The grounds wet,"},"439":{"dur":0,"text":"so we're being cautious."},"441":{"dur":0,"text":"Load up."},"444":{"dur":4,"text":"Look at the big roebuck with the antlers down there, the larger one on the left."},"448":{"dur":0,"text":"Yeah."},"450":{"dur":1,"text":"You're sighted in at 200 metres,"},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"this is 300 metres."},"455":{"dur":3,"text":"Your round wants to go in about 10 inches low."},"459":{"dur":1,"text":"Or about 25 centimetres low."},"462":{"dur":0,"text":"The Kill zone,"},"463":{"dur":0,"text":"on that roebuck,"},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"is about 15 centimetres high."},"467":{"dur":3,"text":"So your elevation point is going to be that angle on the back off his neck."},"471":{"dur":1,"text":"We're aiming off now not dialing."},"473":{"dur":3,"text":"You've got to get about 10 inches visualised over where the bullet will land."},"478":{"dur":1,"text":"We've got the wind to consider as well."},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"now this is why we don't try this on moving animals really."},"484":{"dur":1,"text":"You're going to have too aim on that deer,"},"488":{"dur":0,"text":"a good,"},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"five centimeters or couple inches"},"492":{"dur":1,"text":"to the left of the Kill zone,"},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"to stand a chance of dropping a round into the kill zone."},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, I'm watching, the cameras are rolling,"},"500":{"dur":0,"text":"lets see what happens."},"502":{"dur":0,"text":"Spotting."},"506":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay, it has got it in the middle."},"509":{"dur":0,"text":"I'm going to fire."},"516":{"dur":3,"text":"You got the leg. Tha'ts gone down too low, so we're aiming off."},"520":{"dur":0,"text":"It's not clever is it?"},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"Try one more shot yourself."},"527":{"dur":3,"text":"That's good, it's on the shoulder, it would have dropped it immediately."},"531":{"dur":0,"text":"I'm going one more."},"537":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's in the bottom of the kill zone."},"539":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'm shooting lower than I thought, you've got pretty much on."},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"But I think we've established again for\nthe cameras, try to aim off"},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"in a situation like this is not necessarily\nthe best thing."},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's look at another solution now okay?"},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"We're going to think about dialing."},"556":{"dur":1,"text":"If you take the scope cap off the top."},"558":{"dur":1,"text":"You've got the ballistic set up for the rifle,"},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"we're looking at 300 metres."},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"We've go the wind coming in at 9"},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm just using a solution here, it could be a piece a paper, it could be anything."},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"I mention to you at 14 clicks eariler,"},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"You're already up 5, I want you to come up 9 more clicks."},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"Infact for your rifle I'd come up 8 more clicks."},"582":{"dur":0,"text":"For the wind,"},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"we're still going to aim off."},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"Because there's not time to do both, in a hunting situation it would be"},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"silly to think there was time to do both really."},"591":{"dur":4,"text":"what we're going do now is just aim at nine\no'clock on the edge of the kill zone."},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"You've seen where the wind was, the first wind caught us a bit far out."},"603":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm watching for you."},"604":{"dur":4,"text":"Aim at nine o'clock just on the left edge of\nthe yellow kill zone."},"609":{"dur":0,"text":"Spotting."},"616":{"dur":0,"text":"Heart shot."},"622":{"dur":0,"text":"Kill zone shot."},"623":{"dur":1,"text":"You can see the difference can't you?"},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"It be rude not to go again wouldn't it?"},"628":{"dur":0,"text":"You go."},"629":{"dur":0,"text":"Spotting."},"635":{"dur":0,"text":"Heart shot."},"637":{"dur":0,"text":"Firing."},"643":{"dur":0,"text":"Heart shot."},"645":{"dur":1,"text":"There's a clear message there isn't there?"},"647":{"dur":0,"text":"There is indeed."},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"Never muck about aiming off"},"652":{"dur":0,"text":"at long ranges"},"653":{"dur":4,"text":"unless it's an emergency situation, a bit of knowledge of how to do that can help."},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"if you get time to dial it, you saw the difference didn't you?"},"661":{"dur":1,"text":"Between speculation"},"662":{"dur":0,"text":"and accuracy."},"664":{"dur":0,"text":"Definitely."},"667":{"dur":3,"text":"You wouldn't feel great about shooting a deer at that range for our first two shots would you?"},"671":{"dur":1,"text":"I took it's leg out,"},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"you took its back out, if it was a deer it would have been a real mess."},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"But for a backup shot this kind of\nknowledge is priceless."},"680":{"dur":0,"text":"As you were saying,"},"681":{"dur":3,"text":"this is ideally just for the welfare of\nthe animal, you would never"},"684":{"dur":3,"text":"really take a shot at a animal at this, a\n healthy animal would you?"},"688":{"dur":3,"text":"I wouldn't recommend it particularly not on\nroe deer sized animal."},"692":{"dur":4,"text":"I know that inparticularly, well I just came back from Africa where the"},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"rules of engagement are sometimes a\nlittle different."},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"On a hind cull when things are pushed, when there's a welfare issue in taking"},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"out a number deer relatively quickly."},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"I know that they're are teams of people who do get set up"},"708":{"dur":3,"text":"and if you get two people who know what they're doing who are both set up"},"711":{"dur":1,"text":"who get like us on the top of the hill,"},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"to be fair, to people can make"},"716":{"dur":3,"text":"killing shots on deer, but this is a\nprofessional thing this is not"},"720":{"dur":2,"text":"speculative, amateur, I wonder if I can hit it."},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"If you know you regularly hit ten a\ninch disk"},"726":{"dur":4,"text":"five or six hundred metres, that's time to consider"},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"culling at maybe 250 to 300."},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"Because you've got that get out of jail card involved."},"738":{"dur":1,"text":"Now Cai lets see what happen."},"741":{"dur":1,"text":"This is the deer,"},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"we were running at from 200 metres."},"746":{"dur":1,"text":"Just from over there on that grass bank."},"748":{"dur":1,"text":"We set up at five clicks,"},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"which pretty much gave us a 200 metre zero."},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"Do you remember where you aiming for in the wind? nine o'clock, just about here."},"757":{"dur":3,"text":"Once again we still had the wind on, we were having too aim here"},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"at the back edge of the kill zone at 9."},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the deer we shot at from 300 metres."},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"If you remember what I said was"},"770":{"dur":0,"text":"will have a guess,"},"772":{"dur":0,"text":"we've got about"},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"10 inches to make up in elevation,"},"776":{"dur":0,"text":"we've got about"},"778":{"dur":1,"text":"this much to make up in windage,"},"780":{"dur":1,"text":"so I said let's aim up here somewhere"},"782":{"dur":0,"text":"and see what happens."},"784":{"dur":1,"text":"What happened to your first shot?"},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"It just dropped straight down into the\nback."},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"What happened to my first shot, burying in mind that I'm suppose to know all about this."},"792":{"dur":1,"text":"Took of it's leg."},"795":{"dur":4,"text":"The reason for that is that we weren't aim at the deer, we were aiming off at some random part away."},"800":{"dur":3,"text":"In this grayness up here, it's not\ngood for precision."},"805":{"dur":1,"text":"What we did then,"},"806":{"dur":1,"text":"we both did a quick follow up shot"},"809":{"dur":1,"text":"in the light of your first shot,"},"811":{"dur":1,"text":"you've improved the aim off"},"813":{"dur":1,"text":"and if I remember you put"},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"I think it was that one, I think you shouldered it."},"818":{"dur":3,"text":"And I, in the light of my first poorly delivered shot"},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"made a second shot and it's one of these ones in here."},"825":{"dur":1,"text":"In truth I don't know which one"},"826":{"dur":2,"text":"it might even be that one."},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"So in the aim of an emergency it's better than nothing."},"833":{"dur":1,"text":"Better than running after it with your finger nails."},"836":{"dur":3,"text":"But any thought of taking on anything at\nlonger ranges"},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"you've got to think and you've got to\nhave a reference point"},"843":{"dur":4,"text":"we dialed for the distance, if you remember, you came up I think"},"848":{"dur":3,"text":"an extra 8 clicks, which made it 13."},"851":{"dur":3,"text":"I came up an extra 9, which made it 14 clicks up."},"856":{"dur":1,"text":"And we put in"},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"one, two, three, four"},"861":{"dur":1,"text":"might even be five there."},"865":{"dur":3,"text":"That's a pretty good group at 300, that's 300 metres."},"869":{"dur":2,"text":"We were both aiming there then if you remember, yeah we were."},"872":{"dur":2,"text":"Some of the shots were a little more left and right then others."},"875":{"dur":2,"text":"but we were still aiming effectively to\ngut shoot
