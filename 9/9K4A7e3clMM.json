those things because we like\ndates, and we like, you know, the past and"},"195":{"dur":1,"text":"so on."},"196":{"dur":6,"text":"And I think I should start by saying when\nI taught at Howard

history"},"224":{"dur":3,"text":"and much more about the African-American experience."},"227":{"dur":4,"text":"I'd been an Africanist studying at Columbia\nUniversity."},"232":{"dur":3,"text":"But this was not only what was important."},"235":{"dur":4,"text":"Issues of identity were also important because\nI had students who, you know, I would see"},"240":{"dur":6,"text":"a young man in the back of my class, and he'll\nbe looking at me and not taking any notes"},"246":{"dur":4,"text":"and, you know, after class, I would say, \"Look,\nyoung man, you should be taking notes."},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, we have midterm and final.\""},"253":{"dur":5,"text":"And he says, \"You know, Dr. Heywood, this\nis the first time in my life that I've

had to -- I was having an\nimpact."},"270":{"dur":2,"text":"Just my being there, I was having an impact."},"272":{"dur":6,"text":"I think this pushed me to learn more about\nmy own identity and my own

my old aunt to say, \"What do you know\nabout our background?"},"289":{"dur":5,"text":"I need to let the students know that I have\nan identity, and situate that within the African"},"295":{"dur":3,"text":"diaspora,\" and I'll speak more of that later\nin the discussion."},"299":{"dur":7,"text":"But also, at Howard, I got the, you know,\nopportunities to do a lot of things in connection"},"306":{"dur":5,"text":"with the genetics and biology and anthropology."},"311":{"dur":5,"text":"This was the African Burial Ground to get\nto participate in it, and I thank Dr.

2003, I became involved in some of the"},"343":{"dur":9,"text":"media and other information that Dr. Henry\nLouis Gates became involved in, and then I"},"352":{"dur":4,"text":"really had to know about the African background\nbecause this was why it was important."},"357":{"dur":5,"text":"If you're doing African-American lives, and\nyou're trying to identify individual roots"},"362":{"dur":4,"text":"of African-American, not only did I have to\nknow the American story from the genealogist,"},"367":{"dur":7,"text":"I had to know the story of their biological\nbackground, their genetic background, so I"},"374":{"dur":5,"text":"had to begin reading things that I've never\nread before, and I had to go and study much"},"380":{"dur":7,"text":"more

thought I'd just give you a little"},"425":{"dur":3,"text":"bit of background also about myself and what\ngot me into this area of research interest."},"429":{"dur":5,"text":"So my background was actually in anthropology;\nthat's what I started out as at UC Berkeley."},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"And I was there at the time of Allan Wilson,\nif anybody has heard of him, and he really"},"438":{"dur":4,"text":"helped to found the field of molecular anthropology\nand got me really excited about that."},"443":{"dur":5,"text":"So I wanted to use genetic methods to address\nquestions about human origins, about where"},"449":{"dur":1,"text":"we come from."},"451":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, for that reason, I went on to get\na Ph.D. in human genetics."},"455":{"dur":6,"text":"Now, at that time, I was working in the lab,\nKen Kidd's lab at Yale, and he had a partner,"},"461":{"dur":9,"text":"Luca Cavalli-Sforza, at Stanford, and together,\nthey had a pretty amazing diverse set of DNA"},"471":{"dur":1,"text":"samples from around the world."},"472":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, in Africa, they had two groups, okay,\nwhich everybody was using as the so-called"},"478":{"dur":6,"text":"representative African population, whenever\nthey did population genetics or evolutionary"},"485":{"dur":1,"text":"studies."},"486":{"dur":4,"text":"Those groups happened to be two Central African\npygmy populations."},"490":{"dur":3,"text":"They couldn't be less representative, as it\nturns out."},"494":{"dur":4,"text":"So as part of my thesis, what I wanted to\ndo was look at the variation that existed"},"499":{"dur":5,"text":"amongst the different African populations,\nand to my surprise -- I wasn't expecting this"},"504":{"dur":5,"text":"-- I found so much more variation between\nany pair of African groups that I was looking"},"509":{"dur":5,"text":"at than I would see between Africans and,\nsay, East Asians, for example."},"514":{"dur":5,"text":"And I realized that we had greatly underrepresented\nthe amount of variation in Africa."},"520":{"dur":5,"text":"So after that, once I was a post doc and then\nI went to South Africa to do research for"},"526":{"dur":5,"text":"a while and decided that I wanted to return\nto also my anthropology roots and wanted to"},"531":{"dur":5,"text":"do field work in Africa, largely because nothing\nexisted."},"536":{"dur":4,"text":"There were almost no studies of human genetic\nvariation in Africa."},"541":{"dur":7,"text":"So part of my experience for the past 15 years\nor so, myself, my students, and African collaborators"},"549":{"dur":6,"text":"have been doing fieldwork throughout Africa,\nstudying not only to collect blood samples"},"555":{"dur":6,"text":"but looking at phenotypic variations, so different\ntraits, things like anthropometric traits,"},"562":{"dur":5,"text":"or cardiovascular, or metabolic that can also\nhave disease implications."},"567":{"dur":5,"text":"And so my focus has been really the history\nof Africa and the African people, and then"},"572":{"dur":4,"text":"from that, without that history, I feel like\nyou can't know that much about -- you can't"},"577":{"dur":5,"text":"really know about the history of the African\ndiaspora until we get that settled a bit more"},"582":{"dur":1,"text":"in Africa."},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"That's going to really inform us."},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"Corey Dade:\nThank you, Professor."},"587":{"dur":1,"text":"Professor Blakey."},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"Michael Blakey:\nWell, it's a real pleasure to be here and"},"590":{"dur":5,"text":"to introduce myself as someone who began his\ncareer here."},"595":{"dur":11,"text":"When I was 15, I worked upstairs on 50 skeletons\nanalyzing the health of two populations under"},"607":{"dur":6,"text":"Donald Ortner, and a lot has happened since."},"614":{"dur":7,"text":"In graduate school, my fundamental field is\nphysical anthropology, human biology, but"},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"I never felt that was enough."},"623":{"dur":4,"text":"It's not really meaningful to me just to look\nat human biology."},"628":{"dur":5,"text":"I don't think I can understand it unless I\nknow the cultural context, the social context,"},"633":{"dur":5,"text":"and the economic context of living populations,\nand so I worked on issues of psychophysiological"},"639":{"dur":4,"text":"stress, the cultural and, again, social context\nof past populations."},"644":{"dur":12,"text":"So I'm a bioarcheologist, biocultural, biohistorical,\nand the African Burial Ground Project that"},"656":{"dur":6,"text":"I directed is interdisciplinary, involving\nhistorians, geneticists, and archeologists,"},"662":{"dur":10,"text":"the bioarcheology, physical anthropology,\nskeletal biology is at the core of it."},"673":{"dur":5,"text":"And the Institute for Historical Biology is\nthe one -- a place, a space where we look"},"678":{"dur":8,"text":"at the interplay of biology, culture, and\nhistory."},"686":{"dur":5,"text":"One of the -- for me, one of the best places\nto look at that interplay is in the history"},"691":{"dur":7,"text":"of biology itself, and so I was also back\nhere working on the Hrdlicka papers studying"},"699":{"dur":8,"text":"how genetics and biological anthropology had\nevolved, how evolutionary theory had evolved"},"707":{"dur":4,"text":"within society, its purposes, its influences."},"712":{"dur":9,"text":"And it's clear to me that as the sciences\nseparated from their religious roots, as we"},"722":{"dur":9,"text":"really go from the monastery to the academy,\nas it were, they brought with them certain"},"732":{"dur":8,"text":"ideas about knowledge that are pretty much\nbased in Christianity, so that natural science"},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"takes on a certain authority."},"742":{"dur":3,"text":"Nature takes on an authority not unlike God."},"745":{"dur":7,"text":"Natural scientists have in their hands a method\nfor ascertaining absolute presumed objective"},"752":{"dur":1,"text":"truth."},"754":{"dur":5,"text":"And all of that was -- you know, these are\nideas, not necessarily facts, and all of that"},"759":{"dur":8,"text":"was put in the hands of an ideology of eugenics\nof race whose purpose was to establish that"},"768":{"dur":5,"text":"the inequities that existed in society were\nactually natural inequalities and that we"},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"just have to live with that."},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is a way integrating those things."},"779":{"dur":5,"text":"So when I look at genetics, and I'll talk\na little bit about history, too, I see a field"},"785":{"dur":11,"text":"that's had this problem, and I look at -- we\nare, as a people, enamored with genetics in"},"796":{"dur":7,"text":"a way that turns us away from strong critical\nscrutiny."},"803":{"dur":9,"text":"We believe that DNA is who we are."},"813":{"dur":7,"text":"And yet, in genetics today, you know, there\nare the ideologues and there are the skeptics,"},"820":{"dur":12,"text":"and, on genetic ancestry testing, the skeptics\nare telling us that we have no evidence that"},"832":{"dur":4,"text":"these tests work."},"836":{"dur":6,"text":"We can take the work of Turri [spelled phonetically],\nwho, you know, often what happens is that"},"842":{"dur":5,"text":"it's statistically more likely that an individual\nwill be related to a population that has the"},"848":{"dur":7,"text":"highest percentage of that individual's -- of\na particular gene or haplotype found in that"},"855":{"dur":11,"text":"individual, or a series of them, and by that,\nTurri found that Thomas Jefferson is Somali."},"866":{"dur":1,"text":"[laughter]"},"868":{"dur":5,"text":"And -- but the same gene has fairly high frequencies,\nthough not as high in other parts of the Mediterranean,"},"874":{"dur":4,"text":"and I think the press, and, I don't know,\nmaybe the researchers cleaned that up a bit"},"878":{"dur":9,"text":"by making him -- his ancestry Middle Eastern,\nwhich is biblical, right, and possible."},"888":{"dur":4,"text":"But all of this is really very, very flexible."},"892":{"dur":11,"text":"Ely, Jackson and Jackson found with respect\nto looking at Gullah\/Geechee that with the"},"904":{"dur":6,"text":"haplotypes that they were using -- I'm sorry,\nY chromosome, not the mtDNA that Turri used"},"910":{"dur":15,"text":"-- that 10 percent of the -- of African-Americans\nmight be able to -- 10 percent of the findings"},"925":{"dur":6,"text":"would allow one to show even a region in Africa\nassociated with African-Americans."},"931":{"dur":3,"text":"That means 90 percent of the findings are\nin error."},"935":{"dur":6,"text":"Now, 90 percent error is not some information."},"941":{"dur":2,"text":"That's something else."},"943":{"dur":5,"text":"There is no study that tells whether -- what\npeople are really looking for, which is their"},"949":{"dur":5,"text":"recent history, according to the recent work\nof Royal, they want to know their recent history,"},"954":{"dur":3,"text":"the last 200 years, 400 years."},"957":{"dur":6,"text":"There is no study that tests with people who\nknow that history the accuracy of using DNA"},"963":{"dur":5,"text":"on them, but we believe."},"969":{"dur":6,"text":"Let me say, in closing, at the same time,\nyou know, African-Americans have always been"},"975":{"dur":7,"text":"faced with this problem, resulting from slaveries,\nattempt to destroy their humanity and their"},"983":{"dur":6,"text":"history and family lineages, have created\na historical tradition, historical institutions"},"990":{"dur":13,"text":"as we know, the Journal of Negro History early\non, and"},"1003":{"dur":6,"text":"we might have to settle for understanding\nthat African-Americans are -- represent nearly"},"1010":{"dur":2,"text":"all of Africa, much of Africa."},"1013":{"dur":6,"text":"And so our children have, uniquely, if you\nwill, have cultural characteristics that come"},"1020":{"dur":6,"text":"from all of those places that can be claimed,\nbut they can't understand them; we don't know"},"1026":{"dur":7,"text":"names like Wolof, or Igbo, or Yoruba, or Moors,\nMalagasy."},"1033":{"dur":7,"text":"They don't know what those words mean because\nthere's still virtually no African-American"},"1041":{"dur":7,"text":"and African history in the public schools,\neven in Washington, D.C., Montgomery County,"},"1048":{"dur":4,"text":"throughout the state of Virginia."},"1053":{"dur":4,"text":"And so this is where one finds one's history."},"1057":{"dur":8,"text":"So the abuses of the past continue, and we\nneed to think about what we might do about"},"1066":{"dur":1,"text":"that."},"1067":{"dur":4,"text":"Corey Dade:\nThank you, Professor, and thank you, panel."},"1071":{"dur":2,"text":"So the first question, we want to set a baseline\nhere."},"1074":{"dur":9,"text":"This is all about understanding who we are,\nof course, but as our panel alluded to, or"},"1083":{"dur":4,"text":"really said, there was no allusion at all,\nactually, they're very specific -- you know,"},"1087":{"dur":2,"text":"there are challenges to understanding that\nhistory."},"1090":{"dur":5,"text":"And this is a question for each of you, and\nwe'll start with Professor Tishkoff."},"1095":{"dur":5,"text":"So what are the challenges to understanding\nancestry, and where are the holes, and what"},"1101":{"dur":4,"text":"are the consequences, what have been, historically,\nthe consequences of not being able to understand"},"1105":{"dur":1,"text":"that history?"},"1106":{"dur":3,"text":"Sarah Tishkoff:\nOkay, so as the geneticist here, I'll talk"},"1110":{"dur":5,"text":"about some of the genetic, I think, challenges,\nand I think one of the biggest ones, and this"},"1115":{"dur":5,"text":"is one where I've tried to fill a bit of a\ngap, is just simply not having the data."},"1121":{"dur":3,"text":"And so a lot of the issues, I think, that\narose, particularly with some of the early"},"1125":{"dur":4,"text":"genetic ancestry testing, those that were\nlooking at mitochondrial DNA, just to -- since"},"1130":{"dur":5,"text":"we're starting the day off, I should say that's\na genome that's within the mitochondria of"},"1136":{"dur":3,"text":"the cell, and that's passed on through the\nmaternal lineage."},"1139":{"dur":5,"text":"So a mama passing on to her son and to her\ndaughter, but then it gets passed on the next"},"1144":{"dur":5,"text":"generation just through the mom, okay, so\nyou can trace it back to a common ancestor."},"1150":{"dur":5,"text":"And then you can also look at the Y chromosome,\nwhich is passed on from father to son every"},"1155":{"dur":5,"text":"generation, and then we can look at the rest\nof the nuclear genome which we get from both"},"1160":{"dur":1,"text":"parents."},"1162":{"dur":5,"text":"Now the difference is that most of the mitochondria\nand most of the Y chromosome is not recombining"},"1167":{"dur":1,"text":"every generation."},"1169":{"dur":5,"text":"You can trace them back to actually a single\ncommon ancestor, but the rest of the genome"},"1174":{"dur":6,"text":"is being shuffled every generation, but you\nhave to remember every piece has its own evolutionary"},"1181":{"dur":1,"text":"history."},"1182":{"dur":2,"text":"It's telling you a little different piece\nof the puzzle."},"1185":{"dur":5,"text":"And when you trace back mitochondrial DNA\nor Y chromosome, you're tracing one ancestor"},"1190":{"dur":1,"text":"out of hundreds."},"1191":{"dur":4,"text":"So if you look just in the past few centuries,\nall of us, think about us, we have our mama"},"1196":{"dur":3,"text":"and dad, they have their parents, they have\ntheir parents."},"1199":{"dur":3,"text":"Go back a few hundred years, you have hundreds\nof ancestors."},"1203":{"dur":3,"text":"Go back a thousand, and you have thousands\nof ancestors."},"1207":{"dur":5,"text":"But those tests that are often relying on\nmitochondrial DNA and Y chromosome, they're"},"1212":{"dur":2,"text":"looking at one of those."},"1215":{"dur":5,"text":"And then they're going to look at a database,\nand so what they tell you is going to depend"},"1220":{"dur":5,"text":"on that database, and until we do a really\nbroad survey of Africa, you can get a very"},"1226":{"dur":1,"text":"biased result."},"1227":{"dur":5,"text":"Secondly, these tests are based off and on\nwhat is the prevalence of this lineage in"},"1233":{"dur":1,"text":"a particular region."},"1234":{"dur":4,"text":"It's very hard to trace back to any particular\nethnic group in Africa."},"1239":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, I'll give you a couple of exceptions."},"1241":{"dur":5,"text":"I study a lot of the hunter-gatherer groups\nlike the San click-speaking populations in"},"1246":{"dur":6,"text":"Southern Africa, the so-called pygmies in\nCentral Africa, some hunter-gatherers in East"},"1253":{"dur":1,"text":"Africa."},"1254":{"dur":3,"text":"Some of them have very unique lineages; I\ncould probably tell you, if you have those"},"1257":{"dur":1,"text":"lineages that you trace back there."},"1259":{"dur":3,"text":"But otherwise, it's very challenging."},"1262":{"dur":4,"text":"So nowadays, what we're doing more and more\nis starting to look at the rest of the nuclear"},"1266":{"dur":4,"text":"genome, and it's particularly challenging\nto look at, and we use a lot of statistics"},"1271":{"dur":3,"text":"and probabilistic methodology to do that."},"1274":{"dur":3,"text":"So I would say -- remind me again, the original\nquestion was the challenges, right?"},"1278":{"dur":2,"text":"Corey Dade:\nThe challenges and what the consequences have"},"1280":{"dur":1,"text":"been of that."},"1281":{"dur":1,"text":"Sarah Tishkoff:\nYeah, so the challenges are much of what we"},"1283":{"dur":5,"text":"do, our field, people often don't realize\nit, is about probability."},"1288":{"dur":5,"text":"We use statistics and probability, and it's\nnot exact, as you said."},"1294":{"dur":4,"text":"And what I try to do, what I find most exciting\nis when I look at the history of Africa, for"},"1299":{"dur":4,"text":"example, is trying to integrate that data\nwith the archeological data, or the historical"},"1303":{"dur":2,"text":"data, or the linguistic data."},"1306":{"dur":4,"text":"And so we have to keep in mind that we still\nhave a long ways to go to develop proper statistical"},"1310":{"dur":2,"text":"methods to be able to interpret this data."},"1313":{"dur":5,"text":"And then the data is rapidly changing, so\nnow we can sequence entire genomes,
