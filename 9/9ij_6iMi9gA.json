to the US."},"16":{"dur":2,"text":"I was originally working with adult women."},"19":{"dur":3,"text":"I came originally to work with adult women\ncoming out of the sex industry."},"23":{"dur":4,"text":"And so in that first literally few days,\nfew weeks, few months,"},"27":{"dur":4,"text":"I began to go to Rikers Island Prison\nand up to Hunts Point,"},"31":{"dur":4,"text":"which has been the subject of\nnumerous pseudodocumentaries on HBO,"},"36":{"dur":3,"text":"and began to meet really young girls."},"40":{"dur":3,"text":"I was going into\nan adult correctional facility"},"43":{"dur":2,"text":"and yet meeting 12, 13, 14-year-old girls"},"46":{"dur":4,"text":"who'd been told by their pimp\nto say that they were 17, 18, 19."},"50":{"dur":3,"text":"It was incredibly obvious that\nthey were nowhere close to that age."},"54":{"dur":2,"text":"I was going out on to the streets,"},"57":{"dur":3,"text":"and for any of you who've seen\nany of those HBO type docs,"},"60":{"dur":1,"text":"you know that for many, many years,"},"62":{"dur":4,"text":"there's been areas in New York and\nin Chicago and all over the country"},"66":{"dur":3,"text":"where there's a very, very clear\nkind of prostitution track."},"70":{"dur":5,"text":"And so there would be cars\nliterally lined up on the street,"},"75":{"dur":2,"text":"and I would meet yet again\n12, 13, 14-year-old girls"},"78":{"dur":1,"text":"who were out there being sold."},"79":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, I was 22\nwhen I first came to the States,"},"83":{"dur":3,"text":"and as a survivor\nof commercial sexual exploitation myself"},"86":{"dur":3,"text":"as a teenager --\nI'd gotten out when I was 19 years old --"},"89":{"dur":2,"text":"I've realized that I had\na lot in common with these girls"},"92":{"dur":2,"text":"and young women that I was meeting."},"95":{"dur":2,"text":"And the 40-year-old women\nat that point were like:"},"97":{"dur":2,"text":"What's this little girl going to tell me?"},"100":{"dur":2,"text":"Whereas the 19-year-olds\nwere a little bit more receptive"},"102":{"dur":2,"text":"to this very bright-eyed 22-year-old."},"105":{"dur":3,"text":"So I realized though, that even though\nwe were from different continents,"},"109":{"dur":2,"text":"and the girls would be like:\nWhere's your accent, miss?"},"111":{"dur":2,"text":"You sound like Sporty Spice --"},"114":{"dur":3,"text":"that we had very, very similar stories,"},"117":{"dur":4,"text":"and that cultural difference\nwas kind of overridden"},"122":{"dur":4,"text":"by the similarities\nof the commercial sex industry globally."},"126":{"dur":3,"text":"And so our stories\nof growing up in poverty,"},"130":{"dur":2,"text":"our stories of growing up\nin traumatic homes"},"133":{"dur":3,"text":"where there was lots of domestic violence\nand substance abuse,"},"136":{"dur":4,"text":"our stories of craving attention and love"},"140":{"dur":2,"text":"from our families and generally\nnot getting that,"},"142":{"dur":4,"text":"our stories of kind of getting introduced\ninto the commercial sex industry"},"147":{"dur":4,"text":"through a man or through kind of\nthis moment of desperation"},"151":{"dur":3,"text":"and feeling like: OK, this is\njust something I'll do for the moment,"},"154":{"dur":3,"text":"and I'll figure out my way to get out.\nAnd then getting stuck."},"158":{"dur":3,"text":"And our stories of being treated like\n\"we were less than\""},"162":{"dur":4,"text":"by everyone in the community:\nour families, by law enforcement,"},"166":{"dur":2,"text":"by social workers, by hospital staff."},"168":{"dur":4,"text":"They kind of rang the same,\nwhether it was my experience,"},"172":{"dur":2,"text":"or the experiences\nof the girls that I was serving."},"175":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, in 1998, I decided to start GEMS,"},"177":{"dur":2,"text":"which is\nGirls Educational and Mentoring Services,"},"180":{"dur":1,"text":"kind of based on my own experiences."},"182":{"dur":2,"text":"And at that point, I had\nabsolutely no money,"},"184":{"dur":2,"text":"I had no idea even how to write..."},"186":{"dur":2,"text":"I think I was just beginning\nto learn how to write a proposal."},"188":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, I started GEMS\nliterally on my kitchen table,"},"192":{"dur":3,"text":"and girls would sleep on my couch,\nand eat my food,"},"195":{"dur":2,"text":"and wear my clothes,\nand not bring my clothes back."},"198":{"dur":4,"text":"And so that was about as grass roots\nas you can kind of get"},"202":{"dur":1,"text":"in terms of starting a non-profit."},"204":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was 23, so I had no idea"},"206":{"dur":1,"text":"what starting a non-profit\nwould look like,"},"208":{"dur":2,"text":"which was really, really good."},"210":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I began to work with girls and\nyoung women who were being trafficked."},"215":{"dur":4,"text":"And at that point though, we weren't using\nthat terminology \"trafficking\"."},"219":{"dur":3,"text":"And so \"trafficking\" kind of\ncame into or lexicon,"},"223":{"dur":4,"text":"really it began to come in in 2000, when\nthe Trafficking Victims Protection Act,"},"227":{"dur":1,"text":"federal legislation, was passed."},"229":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, the handful of us\nthat were working"},"231":{"dur":3,"text":"with domestic trafficking victims\nwere really excited and thought:"},"234":{"dur":3,"text":"OK, this is the moment where our girls,\nand young women, and adult women"},"238":{"dur":2,"text":"begin to be treated as victims,\nnot as criminals."},"241":{"dur":4,"text":"And then we realized very quickly that\nthere was this kind of two-tiered system."},"245":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, in terms of how\nthe funding was structured,"},"248":{"dur":3,"text":"in terms of how the training\nfor law enforcement and service providers,"},"252":{"dur":2,"text":"in terms of how kind of\nthe media and the public"},"255":{"dur":2,"text":"began to view this issue over the years,"},"257":{"dur":2,"text":"it was like: Well, there's\nthose real trafficking victims,"},"259":{"dur":3,"text":"there are those girls from Mexico,\nor from Asia, or from the Ukraine,"},"263":{"dur":2,"text":"and you know there's\nthose teen prostitutes from America,"},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"who just kind of want to do this\nand they like doing this."},"268":{"dur":2,"text":"And so the battle over\nthe last really kind of decade,"},"271":{"dur":4,"text":"and change for us, has been about\nreally trying to educate people"},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"that the sexual exploitation\nand trafficking"},"277":{"dur":2,"text":"of girls, and young women, and adult women"},"279":{"dur":4,"text":"in this country looks the same as it does\nfor girls and women globally,"},"284":{"dur":2,"text":"and that you don't have to be\nfrom another country"},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"to feel like you don't have options\nin this country, right?"},"290":{"dur":1,"text":"We're very good at doing the Horatio,"},"292":{"dur":3,"text":"how to pull yourself up\nby your bootstraps, kind of myth,"},"295":{"dur":4,"text":"but if we're being honest, opportunities\naren't equal in this country,"},"299":{"dur":3,"text":"and there are entire segments\nof our young people"},"302":{"dur":3,"text":"for whom opportunities\nare frequently denied."},"305":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, that's what\nwe've continuously found."},"308":{"dur":2,"text":"And I will say that I think if this issue"},"310":{"dur":3,"text":"had affected the number\nof low-income girls of color"},"313":{"dur":2,"text":"that we've seen\nover the last 15 years,"},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"both in New York\nand all over the country,"},"318":{"dur":3,"text":"if it had affected\nwhite middle-class girls in that same way,"},"322":{"dur":5,"text":"we would've seen a very, very different\nsocial and political response by now."},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"We had to educate people to that."},"329":{"dur":4,"text":"Just because you weren't undocumented\ndidn't mean you trusted law enforcement"},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"and went running to law enforcement\nand said, \"Hi, Mr Police Officer,"},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"please rescue me.\"\nRight?"},"339":{"dur":3,"text":"We understand that for women and men\nwho are trafficked globally"},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"whether for sex or labor,"},"345":{"dur":3,"text":"their experiences with law enforcement\nin their own countries"},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"haven't been particularly warm,"},"351":{"dur":3,"text":"and so they may not feel like\nthis is someone that they can go to."},"354":{"dur":2,"text":"That's true for young people\nin our country too,"},"357":{"dur":2,"text":"particularly, young people who've grown up\nin communities of color,"},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"that historically don't have good reason\nto trust law enforcement."},"363":{"dur":1,"text":"And we also had to teach people"},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"that you don't have to be\nchained physically"},"367":{"dur":3,"text":"to a bed or to a wall\nin order to think that you can't leave."},"370":{"dur":1,"text":"And with the domestic violence movement,"},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"we've begun to really work\nover the last 30 years"},"375":{"dur":4,"text":"stopping folks from saying,\n\"Well, why doesn't she just leave?\""},"379":{"dur":3,"text":"And we began to recognize that it was\na lot more complex than that, right?"},"382":{"dur":4,"text":"And that here were many psychological\nand sociological factors"},"387":{"dur":3,"text":"that would stop an adult woman\nfrom leaving an abuser."},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"And so when we're talking\nabout particularly children,"},"393":{"dur":3,"text":"when we're talking about girls\nwho are under the control of somebody"},"396":{"dur":3,"text":"whose entire job is to make them\nloyal and compliant,"},"400":{"dur":3,"text":"we have to be able to apply\nthose same kind of ideas"},"404":{"dur":2,"text":"that we've come up with\nwith domestic violence"},"406":{"dur":3,"text":"and recognize that\nthe physical chains may not be there,"},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"but psychological chains\nare much, much stronger."},"413":{"dur":3,"text":"And when we think about someone like\nElizabeth Smart or Shawn Hornbeck,"},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"who is the little boy,\nwho was found in Missouri,"},"418":{"dur":1,"text":"several years after his kidnapping,"},"420":{"dur":5,"text":"or Jaycee Dugard, we generally don't ask:\nWhy didn't they just leave?"},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"We recognize Stockholm's syndrome\nand trauma bonding."},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"We recognize whatever was done\nto those young people"},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"in the first few days, first few hours,"},"433":{"dur":4,"text":"was enough to keep them psychologically\ntrapped and bonded,"},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"and for them to believe\nthat they couldn't leave."},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"So, that's kind of been the work\nover the last 15 years,"},"442":{"dur":3,"text":"and slowly we're beginning\nin the last maybe year, 18 months,"},"445":{"dur":4,"text":"we're beginning to see\nkind of some level of change,"},"450":{"dur":3,"text":"and this slow shift in public perception,"},"454":{"dur":1,"text":"where we're beginning\nto see more media stuff,"},"456":{"dur":4,"text":"and where we're beginning to see\nkind of folks shifting their perception"},"460":{"dur":3,"text":"of who these girls are,\nwho these women are."},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, I mean, I think,\none of the most critical things"},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"that we've been able to do,\nand that we did in New York,"},"468":{"dur":4,"text":"was be able to change,\nnot just kind of in concept,"},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"but actually in policy this idea"},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"that young people were victims,\nnot criminals."},"478":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, for many years,\nas I was working in juvenile detention,"},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"and like I said on the streets\nand up on Rikers Island,"},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"I was seeing 12 and 13,\n14, 15, 16-year-old girls"},"488":{"dur":3,"text":"who were being arrested and charged\nwith an act of prostitution,"},"491":{"dur":1,"text":"that under New York State law,"},"493":{"dur":3,"text":"they couldn't legally consent to,\nbecause they couldn't legally"},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"consent to sex until they were 17."},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, in any other case,"},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"they would've been\na victim of statutory rape."},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"And yet because money was exchanged,"},"507":{"dur":4,"text":"the 40-year-old, the 30-year-old,\nthe adult man who was buying them,"},"511":{"dur":4,"text":"was no longer seen as a statutory rapist,\nhe was seen just as a \"John\","},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"and he was generally let go\nwith a little pat,"},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"same way we used to treat\ndomestic violence abusers"},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"for many, many years."},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"And the girl, the child\nwho was being bought,"},"527":{"dur":3,"text":"the child who was being sold\nby adult men to adult men,"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"was the one who was arrested, incarcerated"},"533":{"dur":1,"text":"and generally sentenced to a year."},"534":{"dur":4,"text":"We had one case, and this is the case\nthat kind of started the whole thing off,"},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"where we had a 12-year-old\nwho was arrested,"},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"she was sentenced upstate\nto a juvenile detention center for a year,"},"546":{"dur":5,"text":"she had been in the foster care system,\nshe had been totally abandoned by family,"},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"she had a massive history\nof trauma and abuse"},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"and had met an adult man who became\nher \"daddy\", who became her pimp."},"557":{"dur":4,"text":"And the judge said, \"She needed to learn\nproper moral principles.\""},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, that was the case that kind of..."},"564":{"dur":3,"text":"we said, \"Hmm, something's wrong\nwith this legislation,"},"567":{"dur":5,"text":"something's wrong with a law\nthat doesn't protect victims"},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"but sees them, children, as criminals,"},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"and isn't addressing this\nas a human rights issue.\""},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"And yet we've got federal law"},"580":{"dur":4,"text":"that recognizes children\nfrom other countries as victims,"},"584":{"dur":3,"text":"and technically does recognize children\nfrom our country as victims,"},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"but it's not happening at a state level."},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"And so for about 4.5 years,\nthe young women at GEMS and I"},"593":{"dur":1,"text":"trekked up to Albany,\nwe worked very closely"},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"with the legal aid Juvenile\nRights Division,"},"597":{"dur":3,"text":"and in the beginning we would go\nin a room, and it would be 4 legislators,"},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"and they were totally bored and apathetic."},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"And we would go back and\nwe would go back again,"},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"and the girls would say,\n\"It's all white men in suits.\""},"608":{"dur":1,"text":"And say, \"Yes, let's have a conversation"},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"about power and privileged\nand what that looks like\"."},"612":{"dur":3,"text":"And so it became kind of\na civic participation lesson in action"},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"over the course of about 4.5, 5 years."},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"And eventually we were able\nto make New York State"},"621":{"dur":4,"text":"the first state in the country to protect,\nnot prosecute, children"},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"who have been sexually exploited\nand trafficked."},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"That happened in 2008."},"630":{"dur":5,"text":"We were very conscious of kind of what\ncould happen nationally with that law,"},"635":{"dur":2,"text":"And since then 9 of the states"},"637":{"dur":3,"text":"have passed similar, what they're calling\n\"safe harbor\", legislation."},"641":{"dur":3,"text":"So we are now 10 states down,\n40 to go."},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"I would like to believe in 5 years\nwe will look back,"},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"like we look back on many other issues,\nand think,"},"650":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Did we really send\n12-year-olds to jail!?"},"653":{"dur":3,"text":"Did we really let the adult men\nwho were doing the buying and selling go?"},"657":{"dur":3,"text":"That seems ludicrous.\nWe don't live in that kind of country.\""},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I believe that we have\nthe ability to get there,"},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"but I think what's critical\nand what we need to kind of..."},"666":{"dur":4,"text":"the next layer of where we're going\nin the anti-trafficking movement,"},"670":{"dur":3,"text":"ending commercial\nsexual exploitation movement,"},"673":{"dur":4,"text":"is really about kind of making sure\nthat we're tying these issues,"},"678":{"dur":4,"text":"the issue of sexual exploitation\ninto like these larger systemic issues,"},"683":{"dur":4,"text":"because oftentimes what we're finding now\nwith the media focus on this issue,"},"687":{"dur":6,"text":"for anybody who's seeing MSNBC special\nor something in the newspaper,"},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"it tends to be very sensationalized\nand very kind of,"},"696":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Rescue little girls, bad men\n-- arrest them!\""},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"It tends to be that kind of paradigm,"},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"and yet we're not addressing\nthe social factors"},"705":{"dur":4,"text":"that make young people so\nincredibly vulnerable in the first place."},"709":{"dur":3,"text":"Like I said, predominantly,\nwhat we are seeing"},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"are low-income girls, girls of color,"},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"girls who've been\nin the child welfare system,"},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"over 70% of the girls that GEMS serves"},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"have been in the child welfare system\nat some point,"},"721":{"dur":4,"text":"girls who have been victims\nof childhood sexual abuse and trauma."},"725":{"dur":6,"text":"We know that anywhere from 70% to 90%\nof both children and adult women"},"731":{"dur":1,"text":"who end up in the sex industry,"},"733":{"dur":3,"text":"were victims of child sexual abuse\nprior to recruitment."},"736":{"dur":4,"text":"There is no other industry in the world\nthat targets folks"},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"who have been victims\nof childhood sexual abuse,"},"744":{"dur":4,"text":"one of the most traumatic things that\nyou can experience, in such a way, right?"},"748":{"dur":4,"text":"That preys upon the most vulnerable people\nin our society,"},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"some of the most marginalized folks\nin our entire community."},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we have to be able to\naddress some of these root causes,"},"758":{"dur":4,"text":"we have to be able to address\nopportunities for all of our young people,"},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"and make sure that we are not predicating"},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"what your future looks like\nas a young person,"},"768":{"dur":2,"text":"based on the ZIP code\nthat you are born into."},"771":{"dur":3,"text":"We need to make sure\nthat we are addressing"},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"kind of some of\nthese larger systemic issues,"},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"particularly, gender-based violence."},"779":{"dur":1,"text":"And I will say that, you know,"},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"for the last couple of years,\nthere was a point"},"784":{"dur":3,"text":"where you couldn't get like\n3 people in a room to talk about this."},"787":{"dur":3,"text":"And then there was a point when\nyou began to get folks showing up"},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"but now, right, you do\nan anti-trafficking workshop"},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"and there's a ton of people showing up."},"795":{"dur":5,"text":"And yet we can't get folks now to come\nto a domestic violence presentation,"},"800":{"dur":4,"text":"because we think we've solved it,\nwe think we've addressed that,"},"804":{"dur":4,"text":"we think it's one of those things we don't\nreally need to focus on right now,"},"808":{"dur":4,"text":"and yet, we know that domestic violence\nis happening... now."},"813":{"dur":5,"text":"And if I waited another few seconds...\nagain, and again, in our country."},"818":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, we have to be able to address kind\nof the continuum of gender-based violence,"},"822":{"dur":5,"text":"of which commercial sexual exploitation\nand trafficking is just one component."},"828":{"dur":3,"text":"We have to be able to address race"},"831":{"dur":3,"text":"and the impact of racism\non young people in this country,"},"835":{"dur":4,"text":"and particularly how that plays out\nin the commercial sex industry."},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"I will tell you that, and this isn't\na talk about pornography,"},"842":{"dur":5,"text":"but I will tell you that pornography is\none of the few industries anywhere"},"848":{"dur":3,"text":"that you can still be blatantly racist."},"852":{"dur":5,"text":"And I encourage you to look at some\nof the links between race and pornography,"},"858":{"dur":2,"text":"and how that plays out in our culture,"},"860":{"dur":4,"text":"and how we're still\nreally comfortable in that world,"},"865":{"dur":3,"text":"in terms of addressing people through race"},"868":{"dur":3,"text":"and very racialized,\nsexualized stereotypes."},"871":{"dur":2,"text":"We have to be able to think,"},"873":{"dur":4,"text":"where do we want to be\nin 5 to 10 years on this issue,"},"878":{"dur":1,"text":"because sometimes we can go,"},"880":{"dur":2,"text":"and I think this is true\nof all social justice movements,"},"883":{"dur":5,"text":"we can address kind of\nthe very exciting sexy topics,"},"888":{"dur":2,"text":"and not really dig deeper,"},"890":{"dur":3,"text":"and go long term\nfor the long-term gains."},"894":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, every issue\nhas its moment in the sun,"},"897":{"dur":2,"text":"and right now trafficking\nis having its moment."},"900":{"dur":2,"text":"The domestic violence movement\nhad its moment."},"902":{"dur":2,"text":"The

there is\na very particular point in time,"},"912":{"dur":3,"text":"for every social justice issue\nwhere the focus is on it,"},"915":{"dur":2,"text":"and there's a lot of momentum,\nand a lot of
