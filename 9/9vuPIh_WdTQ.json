just"},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"about the relationship\nbeing more horizontal"},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"and power being more diffused."},"371":{"dur":3,"text":"It is actually the fact that\nwhat digital

really"},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"for IT to be\nconfigured in that way."},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"Now I think we need to\npay much more attention,"},"451":{"dur":1,"text":"as projects like this are\ndoing and the projects"},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"that I'm involved are\ndoing, is the means"},"455":{"dur":3,"text":"the arts and creativity\ngive us to actually"},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"make those things\nmore people-centered."},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"So one of the things\nI would say that does"},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"is emphasise\nsomething that I think"},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"is beginning to happen in a\nlot of the things we're hearing"},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"here but is only\nbeginning to happen."},"472":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's that business and\nservice models will actually"},"476":{"dur":4,"text":"be transformed into what I'm\ncalling a full digital context,"},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's a transmedia context."},"483":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's a

interaction."},"498":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's a given that it's only\narts and design and humanities"},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"that are going to give\nback to the economy."},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"That's not just going to come\nfrom IT, because it takes"},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"a huge amount of\nunderstanding of media, what"},"511":{"dur":3,"text":"different media are-- and I mean\nthat in the full arts sense--"},"514":{"dur":4,"text":"and it takes a huge ability\nto experiment and risk."},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that there is a\ndifferent kind of digital"},"521":{"dur":1,"text":"looking glass what we're\ntalking about there."},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think one of the\nthings that's evidenced today"},"526":{"dur":3,"text":"is that we do
