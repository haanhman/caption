And of course"},"208":{"dur":5,"text":"what role might museums play in this, and\nhow are past ideas about art and art history"},"214":{"dur":6,"text":"relevant to the production of art today. So,\nstudying the History of Art is about learning"},"220":{"dur":6,"text":"about the importance of visual artefacts,\nvisual images to a society. What makes people"},"227":{"dur":6,"text":"use and produce them and how different social\nand cultural factors \u2013 and I suppose one"},"233":{"dur":4,"text":"can include things like patronage, for example,\ncollecting, and other things like the impact"},"238":{"dur":5,"text":"of war, or industrialisation, or religion\nof course.

And the students also choose\nto study works in our collection as part of"},"555":{"dur":5,"text":"their course work. For instance, in the final\nyear, students write a dissertation based"},"561":{"dur":5,"text":"on a single work of art. And many of our students\nopt to base that on a work of art within the"},"567":{"dur":5,"text":"collections in the Barber.

But I should add that our location"},"663":{"dur":5,"text":"isn\u2019t all about the Barber. The university\nhas got its own research and cultural collections,"},"669":{"dur":5,"text":"which we also use in our teaching, including\nthe Cadbury research library, which holds"},"674":{"dur":6,"text":"illuminated manuscripts and early printed\nbooks.
