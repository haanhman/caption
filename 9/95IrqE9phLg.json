ahead."},"3277":{"dur":3,"text":">>Anne: The I mean, you spoke of something\nthat we didn't have a chance to talk a lot"},"3280":{"dur":3,"text":"about which is the management training customers\npiece."},"3284":{"dur":3,"text":"And how do you bring customers into the organization\noperationally."},"3287":{"dur":2,"text":"And one way that we see a lot of tech companies."},"3290":{"dur":2,"text":"And eBay is a good example."},"3292":{"dur":4,"text":"Of deploying customers to take care of each\nother in a very strategic way."},"3296":{"dur":5,"text":"So I

do merchandising, customers create\nthe product, they sell it, they support each"},"3315":{"dur":1,"text":"other."},"3316":{"dur":6,"text":"And I think there's an opportunity there that\na lot of tech

opportunities that\nare being missed."},"3328":{"dur":2,"text":">>Frances: And so what I would just say is\nthe guiding principal that we talk about there"},"3331":{"dur":4,"text":"is that you want self-service if that's what\nwe want the customer doing in the absence"},"3335":{"dur":1,"text":"of employees."},"3336":{"dur":4,"text":"We want the design imperative for self-service\nis that it's
