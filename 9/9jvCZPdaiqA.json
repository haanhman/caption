fun."},"436":{"dur":3,"text":"We're going to have to get you into groups\nof five later on, and you're going"},"439":{"dur":3,"text":"to go around and evaluate a number of different\nloop systems with

up."},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"Some of those faults are more about the facility."},"462":{"dur":5,"text":"So, the first thing then, is signage."},"468":{"dur":3,"text":"With any loop system, if it's not signed,\nif there's no information about the loop system"},"472":{"dur":3,"text":"being there, then of course\nnobody's going to know it's there, and nobody's"},"475":{"dur":1,"text":"going to be able

covered."},"503":{"dur":4,"text":"You may have been in the ballroom last night,\nwhich we looped, but in terms"},"508":{"dur":4,"text":"of what we were asked to cover, it was smaller\nthan the area

loop, because\nthe map we were given"},"519":{"dur":3,"text":"was different than the map that they actually\nused to put the tables there."},"523":{"dur":5,"text":"So you check to see that there is good signage,\nand you also check to see"},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"the areas that are covered by the loop are\nsigned and that there is an"},"531":{"dur":4,"text":"information map at the front of the facility\nto tell people where they can,"},"536":{"dur":3,"text":"and where they cannot receive a good loop\nsignal."},"539":{"dur":6,"text":"You'll indicate that on\nthe form that you'll fill in when you complete."},"545":{"dur":4,"text":"The next thing is going to be\na little bit more difficult to do in this"},"550":{"dur":4,"text":"situation, because what we're\nasking you to do, is to evaluate whether the"},"554":{"dur":4,"text":"staff on the premises\nactually know what the system is, how the"},"559":{"dur":4,"text":"system works, and perhaps,\nhow to switch the system on et cetera, so"},"563":{"dur":4,"text":"that you can be confident that even\nwhen you're not there, that the system is"},"568":{"dur":1,"text":"maintained and operational."},"569":{"dur":6,"text":"So, when you go to the venue, you will ask\nto see the people that operate the"},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"system, and just ask them a few questions\nabout the system, know how to use it,"},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"when to use it, whether it's switched on,\nand if they can show you the controls."},"582":{"dur":3,"text":"That will give you some sort of confidence\nas to whether the facility really"},"586":{"dur":4,"text":"knows what they're doing with their particular\ninduction system."},"590":{"dur":5,"text":"So many systems do not work because the facilities\ndon't actually understand"},"595":{"dur":1,"text":"how to switch them on."},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"Or perhaps, even worse, they don't realize\nthat"},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"they need a microphone input on them."},"603":{"dur":7,"text":"We have situations in the UK,\na nice expensive induction loop system [inaudible],"},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"and they complain,\nor people complain that it's not working."},"612":{"dur":4,"text":"You go to the site and you find\nthat there\u2019s no microphone."},"616":{"dur":6,"text":"Obvious to us, but not obvious to everybody."},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"The next thing when you're speaking to these\npeople, you should try and see if"},"627":{"dur":4,"text":"they have a maintenance log, a maintenance\nrecord to make sure that they're"},"631":{"dur":1,"text":"regularly checking the system."},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"They ought to have a log book which shows\nthat"},"636":{"dur":5,"text":"they're checking the system at least once\na week, or once a month worst case,"},"641":{"dur":5,"text":"and perhaps checking--having a full maintenance\ncheck on the system every year."},"646":{"dur":4,"text":"If they don't have such a

acoustic system,"},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"everybody checks the system\nevery day they go into the venue, because"},"660":{"dur":1,"text":"they hear it."},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"With the induction loop\nsystem then, it's only you guys that find"},"665":{"dur":3,"text":"out whether it's not--whether it's\nworking or not on that particular occasion."},"668":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's important that they also\nhave a maintenance procedure."},"673":{"dur":4,"text":"Something else that you check on your list."},"677":{"dur":3,"text":"The next parameter then, is to check that\nthe input is connected."},"681":{"dur":1,"text":"I mentioned\nabout the microphone."},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"It's obvious if a microphone is missing."},"685":{"dur":4,"text":"You won't\nbe able to see it, but sometimes they're using"},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"some other audio feed."},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"The best way you can check that they have\nan audio input to the system,"},"695":{"dur":4,"text":"is that on any of the amplifiers that is good\nquality induction loop amplifiers,"},"699":{"dur":7,"text":"you'll find that there's some LED indication\nthat would either stay on,"},"707":{"dur":1,"text":"or will flicker."},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"That gives you indication that there\u2019s a\ngood signal going into"},"711":{"dur":1,"text":"the system."},"712":{"dur":7,"text":"As I've said, both of these parameters, you're\ngoing to check off"},"720":{"dur":4,"text":"on your checklist here."},"725":{"dur":4,"text":"The next thing is about how does the system\nsound?"},"730":{"dur":5,"text":"What we're going to be looking for is popping\nand crackling noises, they're all"},"735":{"dur":6,"text":"degrading the signal performance, so we will\nrate the amount of popping and"},"741":{"dur":5,"text":"crackling according to a scale, and it's hopefully\nself-explanatory when"},"746":{"dur":3,"text":"you come to see the form."},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"In terms of evaluating the sound, we will\nbe"},"753":{"dur":4,"text":"listening for--checking for the position of\nthe microphones."},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"Are the microphones actually in the right\nplace?"},"760":{"dur":4,"text":"Too often, I go to a site,\nand they use boundary mics mounted on the"},"764":{"dur":3,"text":"ceiling, so they have\nthe microphone up there, mounted on the ceiling,"},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"and that's like me standing\nout here [faint sound], talking to you [normal"},"771":{"dur":1,"text":"sound]."},"772":{"dur":1,"text":"I said,\nthat's like me standing over there talking"},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"to you."},"776":{"dur":2,"text":"If the microphones\nare in the wrong place, they're not going"},"778":{"dur":1,"text":"to pick up the person speaking."},"780":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, you might have a good system, but\nit's not going to deliver any"},"784":{"dur":2,"text":"intelligibility."},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"Microphones are very important in terms of\nany induction"},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"loop system."},"792":{"dur":3,"text":"The next thing you're going to be listening\nfor is distortion."},"796":{"dur":5,"text":"Obviously if the signal is distorted, as Darth\nVader, when he speaks,"},"801":{"dur":1,"text":"we all know what that sounds like."},"803":{"dur":1,"text":"That's kind of what you listen for today."},"804":{"dur":2,"text":"You see if there's any distortion in the signal."},"806":{"dur":3,"text":"If there's distortion,\nof course, the intelligibility is lost."},"809":{"dur":3,"text":"So you're not really going to be able\nto understand what's being said, and you're"},"813":{"dur":5,"text":"not getting the best performance\nout of the system that's been installed."},"818":{"dur":4,"text":"As I said, there's a checklist that\nyou're going to go through, and you're going"},"822":{"dur":5,"text":"to rate the performance under\nthose three categories, on a scale of--well,"},"828":{"dur":3,"text":"really see how good it is."},"831":{"dur":4,"text":"And finally then, we need to check that the\nfield strength, the volume of"},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"the system is sufficient."},"838":{"dur":4,"text":"And clearly, we're looking at a field strength\nof 400 milliamps per meter."},"842":{"dur":3,"text":"That's the loudness of the system, and the\nway"},"845":{"dur":4,"text":"you're going to check that, is by using the\nloop monitors that we will hand out"},"850":{"dur":1,"text":"to you."},"851":{"dur":5,"text":"There's going to be 30, and I think my company\nis giving 13"},"856":{"dur":5,"text":"systems out, and Conny will be giving another\n12 systems out in today\u2019s session"},"861":{"dur":3,"text":"to those people who have registered."},"864":{"dur":5,"text":"So if you get an Ampetronic loop\nreceiver, it will look like

while you are"},"938":{"dur":3,"text":"holding it in front of you, you'll be able\nto tell whether you've got the right"},"941":{"dur":4,"text":"lights on, and it tells you whether it's a\ngood

like\nto."},"1033":{"dur":4,"text":"I'll explain it on the screen a little."},"1038":{"dur":4,"text":"You have an on\/off LED to indicate\nthat it's actually on."},"1042":{"dur":3,"text":"You turn it
