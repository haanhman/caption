he sort of said,"},"668":{"dur":5,"text":"\"Sir Jeremy, deal with these rotters\nfrom the Guardian, deal with them.\""},"674":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, Sir Jeremy came\nto our offices in London in King's Cross,"},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"and basically threatened us\nwith legal action."},"681":{"dur":4,"text":"He said that unless\nwe stop publishing stories,"},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"we had to return this material,"},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"we would be hold up before a judge"},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"and possibly even closed down."},"692":{"dur":3,"text":"We explained, Alan Rusbriger, my

on."},"703":{"dur":4,"text":"Sir Jeremy said, this is the authentic\nvoice of aristocratic Britain,"},"708":{"dur":5,"text":"he essentially said that\nthe Prime Minister

story."},"735":{"dur":3,"text":"We continued publishing,\nI was in a kind of secret bunker."},"738":{"dur":2,"text":"What we tried to do\nwas what Snowden had told us to

matters,"},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"terrorism, Afghanistan, Iraq and so on."},"751":{"dur":3,"text":"But this brought us into a deep\nconflict with the British Government."},"754":{"dur":1,"text":"And eventually we were told"},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"unless you smash your computers up,\nwe will close you down."},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"And two middle-age spies from GCHQ,"},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"that's the British equivalent of the NSA,"},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"came to The Guardian\non a quiet Saturday morning,"},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"and we symbolically agreed\nto destroy our hard drives,"},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"which you saw there."},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"It was a surreal episode,"},"774":{"dur":3,"text":"they told us to buy drills and face

said, \"We're not going to use\nyour degausser, we don't trust you.\""},"789":{"dur":4,"text":"\"Yes, you will.

the Snowden files."},"803":{"dur":3,"text":"I think, I write in my book I describe it"},"806":{"dur":3,"text":"as part Stassi, part pantomime."},"810":{"dur":2,"text":"But I think for people\nwho care about press freedom,"},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"it was very chilling."},"815":{"dur":3,"text":"The extraordinary thing\nwas that the two spies had spent"},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"two weeks staking out our building"},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"and they left with\npresents from Hamleys,"},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"the London toy store for their children,"},"825":{"dur":3,"text":"back to the

the book,"},"834":{"dur":4,"text":"but he was upset about\nthe implication that he was provincial."},"839":{"dur":3,"text":"Provincialism being\nthe worst kind of offense."},"843":{"dur":4,"text":"So

right?"},"860":{"dur":3,"text":"The genius of Snowden was\nthat he actually turned over documents,"},"864":{"dur":1,"text":"he didn't merely assert."},"866":{"dur":4,"text":"So now we know the

been."},"903":{"dur":2,"text":"If you go to your privacy settings,\nyou can find out,"},"905":{"dur":1,"text":"it's all being collected."},"907":{"dur":2,"text":"So we've had an enormous debate\nover
