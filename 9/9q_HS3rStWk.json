television."},"255":{"dur":8,"text":"So, as it turns out, television is a hybrid\nword, Greek and Latin, tele meaning far and"},"263":{"dur":2,"text":"then vision meaning well, obviously, vision."},"265":{"dur":1,"text":">>Jane Espenson: Vision."},"266":{"dur":1,"text":">>Brad Bell: You know?"},"268":{"dur":3,"text":"[Laughter]\n>>Brad Bell: So, far vision, so when you

too."},"283":{"dur":1,"text":"And maybe Guam."},"284":{"dur":1,"text":"[Laughter]"},"285":{"dur":4,"text":">>Jane Espenson: but anyways, it's not as\nfar as the worldwide

their disposal to make decisions."},"422":{"dur":3,"text":"They end up with a couple assumptions."},"425":{"dur":6,"text":"I think that they assume that they can predict\nhow a show's gonna do via testing."},"431":{"dur":5,"text":"I once asked some executives, though, in a\nmeeting, I said, \"Have you ever tested the"},"436":{"dur":1,"text":"testing?"},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"Have you ever gone

that, they\nhad crunched the numbers and there was a slight"},"446":{"dur":1,"text":"negative correlation."},"448":{"dur":4,"text":"[Laughter]\n>>Jane Espenson: And yet testing is still"},"453":{"dur":4,"text":"used so they're clearly not getting the information\nthat they need to know about what to predict"},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"what shows have an audience."},"460":{"dur":5,"text":"They also make this big assumption that the\ncast of a show is gonna look like the audience"},"466":{"dur":1,"text":"of that show."},"468":{"dur":3,"text":"So if they see a show with gay actors they're\ngonna assume that they're only gonna get a"},"471":{"dur":1,"text":"gay audience."},"472":{"dur":7,"text":">>Brad Bell: Which is, sort of, I think

Espenson: Yeah, it's propagated this\nassumption."},"487":{"dur":4,"text":">>Brad Bell: Right because, you know, 30 years\nago there weren't those tiny little markets"},"492":{"dur":5,"text":"so you

Bell: Well exactly and so what they\nend up doing is making generic content as"},"583":{"dur":5,"text":"opposed to universal content when, when you\nreally look at the history of what works most"},"589":{"dur":4,"text":"effectively, you have very specific characters,\nyou have, you have a world that you can't"},"594":{"dur":3,"text":"relate to and that's why you're interested\nin

case."},"635":{"dur":3,"text":">>Brad Bell: Well I think that there was a\nnatural fragmentation with the internet and"},"639":{"dur":7,"text":"with, you know, different choices of things\nto watch but I think that it's being fed by"},"647":{"dur":4,"text":"the other side as well because people are\ngoing, \"Oh, we want niche, okay let's make"},"651":{"dur":1,"text":"it just for this

creators."},"661":{"dur":3,"text":">>Jane Espenson: And third, in case you forgot\nwe were counting on a list, the third and"},"665":{"dur":5,"text":"final reason I think that network TV doesn't\nmake content like this is because the main"},"670":{"dur":4,"text":"metric they have for measuring how well a\nshow is doing is pure ratings, just numbers,"},"675":{"dur":4,"text":"households, not how engaged the people are\nbut just how many there are."},"679":{"dur":4,"text":"And this would be like we had someone make\nan analogy to us once about, like, \"Imagine"},"684":{"dur":4,"text":"you're

niche and testing tells us\nthings that we know are wrong but we believe"},"775":{"dur":1,"text":"anyway.\""},"776":{"dur":1,"text":"So there's all sorts of reasons why."},"777":{"dur":1,"text":"So,
