So if Andrew just moves his hand there,"},"325":{"dur":5,"text":"we can see the stock is coming down at this\nangle and what it creates is different lengths"},"330":{"dur":7,"text":"from the trigger pull to what we call the\nmid, the toe and the heel of the gun.

If you just dismount\nit a minute Andrew and do that up we can actually"},"360":{"dur":6,"text":"see what is going on.

If he was a little\nbit larger it would be tucked in and have"},"378":{"dur":4,"text":"a gap at the top.

And what we can do is\ngo back to my demonstration earlier of when"},"423":{"dur":5,"text":"we are looking the gun is empty, is all we\ndo is look down the end of the gun and I can"},"428":{"dur":4,"text":"see there is a slight curve on the cast of\nthe gun as I look down it on the left hand"},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"side and that tells me it is cast off."},"436":{"dur":5,"text":"When we are looking at the height of the comb\nwhat we do is we measure back from the flat"},"441":{"dur":4,"text":"of the gun all the way back through to the\nback and we have 3 measurements. We measure"},"446":{"dur":6,"text":"the height at the comb, height at the face,\nwhich is the mid point and height at the heel."},"452":{"dur":4,"text":"And we measure those because actually the\ncast and the bend of the gun will actually"},"456":{"dur":5,"text":"change that, but also you need to know how\nhigh up the distance to where the face is"},"462":{"dur":4,"text":"to where the eye sits on the barrel.

So what we need to do in that\ninstance is to look at the height of the comb."},"520":{"dur":7,"text":"So we will go back to the gun and the keys\nand what we will do, they are very easy to"},"529":{"dur":6,"text":"manipulate these guns. You just slightly undo\nthe screws and just from my guess work and"},"536":{"dur":5,"text":"it really is guess work, trial and error,\ngetting some feed back from your client exactly"},"542":{"dur":5,"text":"where they think it should be and obviously\nexperience with the shape of people will help."},"547":{"dur":4,"text":"So if you do the same exercise.

There is a possibility that the"},"562":{"dur":4,"text":"end of the gun is just covering the bottom\nof the coloured piece of his eye. So what"},"567":{"dur":4,"text":"I think I will do now is if Andrew drops the\ngun down a little bit again, I will just lift"},"572":{"dur":5,"text":"it a tiny bit. A tiny measurement will make\na difference obviously when everything goes"},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"up to a further distance away, a few millimetres\nat"},"581":{"dur":5,"text":"this end can make a massive difference on\nthe bird that is 30 or 40 yards away."},"587":{"dur":6,"text":"See what is going on with that. So if you\njust mount that up again Andrew and I will"},"594":{"dur":4,"text":"come round again and just have a look and\nI can see all of his eye there now.
