he introduced several important changes."},"507":{"dur":4,"text":"First, fixed terms of office, and a retirement age"},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"for senior officials, not tenure for

stop"},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"\"substituting the former for the latter.\""},"574":{"dur":3,"text":"Next, select officials who were younger,"},"577":{"dur":4,"text":"better educated, and better

find the best people,"},"600":{"dur":4,"text":"well-educated people, and promote them systematically."},"605":{"dur":3,"text":"And finally, strengthen the collective

in the 1980s."},"667":{"dur":3,"text":"In 1987, the constitution was even revised"},"671":{"dur":4,"text":"to formally separate the party from the government"},"676":{"dur":4,"text":"and eliminate these kind of party-leading groups"},"681":{"dur":3,"text":"that used to sit, and still sit now, actually,"},"685":{"dur":3,"text":"in government ministries and departments."},"690":{"dur":3,"text":"So, delegate more authority to the government."},"693":{"dur":3,"text":"But then, in 1989, China had a crisis"},"698":{"dur":3,"text":"that almost brought down the regime."},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"There were demonstrations, pro-democracy,"},"704":{"dur":3,"text":"anti-corruption demonstrations in more than"},"708":{"dur":3,"text":"130 cities in China, mostly

system"},"725":{"dur":3,"text":"really came to the brink of collapse."},"729":{"dur":3,"text":"Deng Xiaoping ordered the People's Liberation Army"},"732":{"dur":3,"text":"to come in and use force to put down the demonstrations."},"736":{"dur":1,"text":"They followed orders."},"738":{"dur":2,"text":"Actually, at the time, there was speculation"},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"about splits in the military."},"742":{"dur":1,"text":"Turned out, not."},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"There were a few dissenters, but by and large,"},"747":{"dur":4,"text":"they followed Deng's orders and put down the demonstrations"},"751":{"dur":3,"text":"and the PRC survived, but after that crisis,"},"756":{"dur":1,"text":"some of the most influential leaders"},"758":{"dur":4,"text":"of the Chinese Communist Party diagnosed the problem"},"762":{"dur":4,"text":"of, you know, why did the regime almost collapse, here?"},"767":{"dur":4,"text":"Why did people rise up to criticize problems like this?"},"773":{"dur":3,"text":"And they blamed it on the fact that the party"},"776":{"dur":4,"text":"had reduced its power over the government and over society,"},"785":{"dur":3,"text":"and so they made a U-turn and reversed"},"790":{"dur":4,"text":"some of the delegation of authority from the party"},"794":{"dur":4,"text":"to the government, including this 1987 amendment"},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"about eliminating the party groups"},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"within the government ministries."},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"But many of the other institutional trends"},"808":{"dur":2,"text":"still continued, like fixed terms of office,"},"811":{"dur":4,"text":"like peaceful transfer of authority, succession,"},"818":{"dur":3,"text":"like regular meetings of the central committee,"},"822":{"dur":4,"text":"and after Deng Xiaoping, the following leaders of China,"},"829":{"dur":4,"text":"Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, were not strongman leaders."},"835":{"dur":4,"text":"They were just first among equals, and China made decisions"},"840":{"dur":4,"text":"in the party by a kind of collective leadership."},"845":{"dur":4,"text":"Jiang Zemin retired in a peaceful transfer of power in 2002."},"852":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, he kept his military role for two more years,"},"855":{"dur":3,"text":"but he stepped down from his party leadership"},"859":{"dur":4,"text":"and government presidency, and that was the first time"},"864":{"dur":3,"text":"this peaceful transfer of power had ever happened"},"868":{"dur":2,"text":"in a major communist country."},"871":{"dur":2,"text":"So, it was a remarkable achievement"},"874":{"dur":2,"text":"to change the system in that way,"},"877":{"dur":3,"text":"and obviously stabilize the system considerably,"},"881":{"dur":4,"text":"'cause succession is always kind of a risk factor"},"889":{"dur":2,"text":"for the stability of a communist country,"},"891":{"dur":2,"text":"because of the elite competition"},"895":{"dur":3,"text":"that could lead to a leadership split."},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"Hu Jintao also retired peacefully,"},"902":{"dur":2,"text":"and he even gave up his military"},"906":{"dur":3,"text":"commander of chief position in 2012."},"911":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, Xi Jinping was chosen by the top leaders of the party"},"919":{"dur":3,"text":"to succeed Hu Jintao in 2012, and they thought"},"924":{"dur":3,"text":"he would be, sort of, more or less the same"},"928":{"dur":2,"text":"as Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin,"},"930":{"dur":2,"text":"meaning not a charismatic leader,"},"933":{"dur":3,"text":"not a person with a strong personal following,"},"937":{"dur":3,"text":"just a good team player who can manage"},"942":{"dur":3,"text":"collective leadership without trying"},"945":{"dur":2,"text":"to seek too much power for himself,"},"948":{"dur":4,"text":"and they thought it was a good idea to have a princeling,"},"955":{"dur":3,"text":"a son of one of the founding members of the"},"960":{"dur":3,"text":"Chinese Communist Party, the leaders in the revolution,"},"963":{"dur":4,"text":"people in the Deng Xiaoping, Mao Zedong generation."},"967":{"dur":4,"text":"They thought having a leader who was in that kind of"},"973":{"dur":3,"text":"royal family of the communist party would be"},"978":{"dur":4,"text":"also a good thing, because these are the people whose,"},"984":{"dur":4,"text":"all of their assets, meaning their corrupt assets"},"989":{"dur":4,"text":"as well as just their security of them and their family"},"995":{"dur":3,"text":"would depend on the survival of party rule."},"998":{"dur":3,"text":"In other words, they identify more with the"},"1005":{"dur":4,"text":"survival of the party than just an ordinary politician."},"1010":{"dur":2,"text":"It's everything to them."},"1013":{"dur":3,"text":"So, Xi Jinping was basically chosen because he"},"1020":{"dur":2,"text":"looked to be moderately competent"},"1022":{"dur":4,"text":"and he was the princeling leader of the right age"},"1027":{"dur":2,"text":"to move into a leadership position."},"1032":{"dur":4,"text":"But Xi Jinping has surprised people in China and abroad"},"1039":{"dur":3,"text":"by consolidating his personal authority"},"1043":{"dur":3,"text":"in a way that we haven't seen since Mao Zedong,"},"1048":{"dur":2,"text":"and people who know him say that he"},"1052":{"dur":3,"text":"really has a sense of mission to save"},"1056":{"dur":3,"text":"Chinese Communist Party rule in China."},"1059":{"dur":4,"text":"He wants to, he's been very spooked by what he knows"},"1064":{"dur":4,"text":"about the fall of the communist party in the Soviet Union."},"1070":{"dur":3,"text":"He wants to find ways to avoid that fate"},"1074":{"dur":2,"text":"for the Chinese Communist Party,"},"1077":{"dur":4,"text":"and in his view, leaders like Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao"},"1084":{"dur":3,"text":"were mediocre imposters who were just kind of"},"1090":{"dur":4,"text":"minding the store until princelings like Xi Jinping"},"1096":{"dur":4,"text":"were of the proper age to come in and inherit power"},"1101":{"dur":3,"text":"from their fathers, the revolutionary founders."},"1107":{"dur":4,"text":"So, Xi Jinping appears to be building his power,"},"1115":{"dur":4,"text":"his personal power in China, in a way that is modeled"},"1120":{"dur":2,"text":"on Mao Zedong, and maybe it's a little bit of a"},"1123":{"dur":2,"text":"combination between Deng Xiaoping and Mao Zedong,"},"1125":{"dur":2,"text":"because he does espouse a platform"},"1130":{"dur":4,"text":"of economic reform, although those economic reforms"},"1134":{"dur":3,"text":"have been not moving very quickly, and there is"},"1137":{"dur":4,"text":"some question about how strong his personal commitment is"},"1142":{"dur":3,"text":"to the third wave of economic reform."},"1146":{"dur":3,"text":"But, you know, I was sort of puzzled on why"},"1150":{"dur":3,"text":"he was modeling himself on Mao Zedong,"},"1155":{"dur":3,"text":"given the tragic results of Mao Zedong's rule,"},"1159":{"dur":4,"text":"and given the fact that he himself and his family"},"1163":{"dur":3,"text":"were the victims of Mao Zedong rule,"},"1170":{"dur":2,"text":"and I still don't really have a complete answer"},"1173":{"dur":2,"text":"to that question in my own mind,"},"1175":{"dur":2,"text":"but it seems that he really doesn't have"},"1178":{"dur":4,"text":"a lot of models of leadership that he's familiar with,"},"1183":{"dur":3,"text":"and the one he knows best is the Mao model,"},"1188":{"dur":4,"text":"and that's the game plan he appears to be following."},"1194":{"dur":3,"text":"He's ruling the country by leading a number"},"1202":{"dur":3,"text":"of leading small groups, ad hoc organizations"},"1207":{"dur":4,"text":"that are inter-agency coordination bodies at best,"},"1215":{"dur":2,"text":"and he's selected a few individuals"},"1219":{"dur":4,"text":"who he really trusts to be the heads of the offices"},"1224":{"dur":4,"text":"of these leading small groups on economic reform,"},"1229":{"dur":4,"text":"on internal security or the National Security Council,"},"1235":{"dur":2,"text":"which is mostly about internal security,"},"1238":{"dur":4,"text":"less about international security, on cybersecurity."},"1243":{"dur":2,"text":"I think there's something like seven of these leading"},"1245":{"dur":3,"text":"small groups, and unusually, this is not"},"1248":{"dur":1,"text":"the case for previous leaders,"},"1250":{"dur":3,"text":"he made

nothing,"},"1278":{"dur":3,"text":"because he does only have 24 hours in his day,"},"1281":{"dur":3,"text":"he's not superhuman, and how does he actually"},"1286":{"dur":3,"text":"manage all of these different policy areas?"},"1290":{"dur":1,"text":"He has to delegate."},"1293":{"dur":3,"text":"But for Xi Jinping, he really appears to have"},"1297":{"dur":4,"text":"a pretty low opinion of the professional bureaucrats"},"1301":{"dur":3,"text":"in the government and even in the party, and so,"},"1305":{"dur":2,"text":"he's delegated to these few people"},"1308":{"dur":3,"text":"he's plucked out of different walks of life"},"1314":{"dur":3,"text":"who he feels are really completely loyal to him"},"1319":{"dur":3,"text":"and are able people, and he works through

party to do it."},"1366":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, the State Council is really not doing much."},"1371":{"dur":3,"text":"It's kind of immobilized, and so much of the"},"1374":{"dur":2,"text":"authority

massive anti-corruption campaign"},"1391":{"dur":3,"text":"against corrupt party and government officials,"},"1398":{"dur":2,"text":"In order to restore the integrity of the party"},"1401":{"dur":2,"text":"so people will support the party,"},"1403":{"dur":4,"text":"and I have to say it's been hugely popular with the public."},"1409":{"dur":2,"text":"The public was really
