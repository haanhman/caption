What I want you to do is, we're going\nto develop some areas of splatter, so one here."},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"(Graeme) Yeah.\n(De) One down here.\n(Graeme) Yeah."},"441":{"dur":3,"text":"(De) And one up there. So what I want\nyou to do is load up your brush.\n(Graeme) Yeah."},"445":{"dur":4,"text":"(De) And then just, when your brush\nstops, the paint\u2019s going to come off it."},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"(Graeme) So I just do that over the top of yours?\n(De) Yeah.\n(Graeme) Okay."},"452":{"dur":4,"text":"(De) I'll be the locator with my Quinacridone\nMagenta here and you just follow me along."},"457":{"dur":8,"text":"(De) So one of the important things about spatter is you can\nuse it to give a sense of perspective right from the start."},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"(De) So when your brush is fully loaded Graeme\u2026\n(Graeme) Yes."},"468":{"dur":3,"text":"(De) You'll get big dots and as it\nempties out you'll get smaller ones."},"472":{"dur":4,"text":"(De) So if you concentrate your bigger dots\ndown here at the front under the painting,"},"476":{"dur":4,"text":"(De) it'll straight away get that whole\nspacial thing happening where\nthe top part of the painting is"},"481":{"dur":1,"text":"(De) further away from us than the bottom."},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"(Graeme) How about that?\n(De)  It's good fun huh."},"486":{"dur":3,"text":"(Graeme) Ah it\u2019s just the great enjoyment.\n(De) Alright that's enough."},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"(Graeme) Yeah, yeah I feel\nlike I'm getting carried away."},"491":{"dur":1,"text":"(De) Put the brushes down and\nmove away from the painting."},"493":{"dur":0,"text":"(Graeme) Step away from the painting."},"494":{"dur":6,"text":"(De) And now because I know there's going\nto be some wings in here, what I'm\ngoing to do is comb some of this."},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"(De) So I'm going to\npull this with my comb\u2026"},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"(Graeme) Ah.\n(De) \u2026just lightly. That needs to dry."},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"(Graeme) Okay we'll let that dry and\nthen we move onto the next section."},"508":{"dur":1,"text":"(De) Indeed we do.\n(Graeme) Cool."},"524":{"dur":6,"text":"(Graeme) Well as you can see De has actually\nmoved on, the canvas has dried, but there's a\nbeautiful, beautiful soft pattern in here as well."},"531":{"dur":6,"text":"(Graeme) And you're actually using charcoal to sketch\nout your main characters, which are obviously,"},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"(Graeme) you've actually got cockatoos that\nyou're turning into lorikeets, is that right?"},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"(De) That's right.\n(Graeme) Okay."},"542":{"dur":2,"text":"(De) Because I can.\n(Graeme) Artistic license."},"544":{"dur":6,"text":"(De) Exactly. I'm just giving myself a\nfairly rough guideline. Okay, I'm finished\ndrawing for the moment."},"551":{"dur":3,"text":"(De) We're going to move on to\nthe next most exciting thing.\n(Graeme) Great."},"554":{"dur":6,"text":"(De) I'm going to be mixing the\nChromachryl texture paste. I really like\nthe consistency of this particular brand."},"560":{"dur":5,"text":"(De) I find some of the modeling compounds\nare too stiff and when I try and push them\nthrough the plastic bag,"},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"(De) I explode the plastic\nbag all over the place."},"568":{"dur":3,"text":"(Graeme) Oh fair enough. And you just use\nsandwich bags do you, in doing that?"},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"(De) Well that's the next process. Right now\u2026\n(Graeme) Okay."},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"(De) I'm going to be using palette knives."},"576":{"dur":4,"text":"(Graeme) Okay. And you do, with your particular\ntechniques, you do use a lot of paint don't you?"},"581":{"dur":6,"text":"(Graeme) These are three dimensional paintings,\nthat's the best way I can describe them."},"587":{"dur":5,"text":"(De) So what I'm doing here is a loaded\nblend of paint and textured paste."},"593":{"dur":5,"text":"(De) I want this to stay sitting up as it dries.\nOkay so I've mixed that\u2026\n(Graeme) Yeah."},"598":{"dur":4,"text":"(De) \u2026not very well. It's a bit like muffin mix,\nyou don't want to, you don't want kill it.\n(Graeme) Okay."},"602":{"dur":10,"text":"(De) So I've got my biggest palette knife,\nloaded up, making sure that the paint is still\nvariegated and it\u2019s all the way to the end."},"612":{"dur":3,"text":"(De) And then what I'm going\nto do is bed it down here.\n(Graeme) Yeah."},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"(De) So give it a little squish\u2026\n(Graeme) Yeah."},"619":{"dur":6,"text":"(De) \u2026so that it builds up either side of the\nblade and then I'm going to create a feather."},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"(Graeme) Look at that. Isn't that great?"},"628":{"dur":5,"text":"(Graeme) And when you say variegated\nit really means you've got a lot of the\ncolours in there that are separated."},"633":{"dur":4,"text":"(De) Yes, correct.\n(Graeme) Sumptuous is the word.\n(De) Recklessly sumptuous."},"637":{"dur":5,"text":"(Graeme) Recklessly sumptuous, that's\nwonderful. You do travel around a lot\ndoing workshops don't you?"},"643":{"dur":5,"text":"(De) I do. And there's this thing that happens\nwhere, when I go one time, they have me back."},"649":{"dur":3,"text":"(De) So I've been, I've done\nfour workshops in Tassy now."},"652":{"dur":6,"text":"(De) And I\u2019ve done, I've been to Dubbo\na lot of times. I'm going there to judge\ntheir annual art competition\u2026"},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"(Graeme) Oh wow.\n(De) \u2026in about 6 weeks."},"660":{"dur":7,"text":"(Graeme) I can see why. You've only got\nto spend a little bit of time with De to find out\nthat her personality is quite electric"},"667":{"dur":5,"text":"(Graeme) but it's just really fun to be with\nher. And fun to see what she does, it really is."},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"(De) You say the nicest things, Graeme."},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"(Graeme) But it's the truth, it really is."},"678":{"dur":9,"text":"(De) Okay so now I'll start again on the other\nside to pull it in. But because, because I can't,\nI'm left handed, I have to work left handed,"},"687":{"dur":8,"text":"(De) so I'll have to turn it all around. I\nthink working with the natural flow of\nyour body is really important."},"696":{"dur":7,"text":"(De) It's also really important to work with the\nbig muscles of your elbow and your shoulder rather\nthan the little tiny stuff of your fingers."},"703":{"dur":8,"text":"(De) I think with dynamic work like this. You\nknow let your body speak, make it a mind,\nbody visceral whole story."},"712":{"dur":1,"text":"(Graeme) You're obviously Mediterranean\nfrom somewhere aren\u2019t you?"},"714":{"dur":5,"text":"(De) I lived in Ingham for a long time.\n(Graeme) Did you? Okay.\n(De) A lot of Italian folks there."},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"(Graeme) Untie my hands, I need to speak."},"721":{"dur":8,"text":"(De) Precisely. One of the hardest things about being\nan artist is getting out of your own way and just"},"730":{"dur":3,"text":"(De) understanding that the\nuniverse knows better than you do."},"733":{"dur":6,"text":"(De) And if you can get out of your own way\nand your own ego and let that happen you're\ngoing to have some better work."},"740":{"dur":10,"text":"(De) The possibilities are much more open. Okay,\nso I'm going to go now with the second row of\nfeathers along the inside of the wing."},"750":{"dur":5,"text":"(De) So I'm just drawing here on my knowledge\nof where the feathers sit in a bird\u2019s wing."},"755":{"dur":6,"text":"(Graeme) It's like sculpture with paint. It's unreal.\n(De) Well I was a sculptor\u2026"},"761":{"dur":4,"text":"(Graeme) Oh okay.\n(De) \u2026for twelve years. I've sculptured my\nway through eight tons of clay."},"765":{"dur":6,"text":"(Graeme) Oh goodness.\n(De) Art chooses us, we don't choose it.\nYou know, deny that at your own peril."},"772":{"dur":5,"text":"(De) You are going to be a miserable person\nif you don't paint. Do it. Get inspired.\n(Graeme) She's brilliant."},"778":{"dur":4,"text":"(De) You could watch Put Some Colour In Your\nLife and get a whole lot of new\ntechniques. How does that work?"},"783":{"dur":7,"text":"(Graeme) Oh it's wonderful. Okay so you're\ngoing to turn it around and you're\ngoing to show us a technique"},"790":{"dur":3,"text":"(Graeme) and then we're going to move\non and let you work for a little while.\n(De) Yep."},"794":{"dur":4,"text":"(Graeme) A technique involving\nthe body and some doilies?"},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"(De) Highly technical\npiece of equipment again."},"801":{"dur":3,"text":"(Graeme) That's great.\n(De) Get these from your local art shop.\n(Graeme) Yeah."},"804":{"dur":4,"text":"(De) Don't tell the ladies what you're doing with\nthem because you know what's going to happen is"},"808":{"dur":6,"text":"(De) they'll refuse to sell them to you. If you\nsay I'm going to cut these up and push paint\nthrough them. No they're not happy about that."},"815":{"dur":5,"text":"(Graeme) You can't do that. But it's a\nfascinating technique that just gives\nyou an amazing texture in your work."},"821":{"dur":3,"text":"(Graeme) I love the colours but; they're just so rich."},"824":{"dur":8,"text":"(De) These colours, this brand: marvelous. So what\nI'm going to do is locate part of the pattern."},"832":{"dur":6,"text":"(Graeme) Yeah.\n(De) That works with the idea of the chest feathers\u2026\n(Graeme) Yeah."},"838":{"dur":9,"text":"(De) \u2026and then I'm going to pick up\nsome yellow and push it through. I can just\nsee my charcoal drawing through there."},"847":{"dur":4,"text":"(Graeme) I suppose once you get a little bit of paint\non there it tends to stay there anyway does it?"},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"(De) Yes it does."},"859":{"dur":8,"text":"(Graeme) There you go. Got to do something\nelse. But then again that's what\nright brain people are like."},"862":{"text":"(Graeme) So how did you come up with this\nparticular technique? It\u2019s just a matter\nof the journey of discovery.\n(Graeme) There you go. Got to do something\nelse. But then again that's what\nright brain people are like.","dur":0},"867":{"dur":0,"text":"(De) Yeah."},"868":{"dur":7,"text":"(Graeme) There's no way of getting away from it. We\ndon't, it's very difficult for a right-brained\nperson to use the word bored at any stage."},"876":{"dur":2,"text":"(De) Definitely.\n(Graeme) There's always something you can do."},"878":{"dur":7,"text":"(De) Oh and if you can do things that no\none else has done, then there's the\nthrill of discovery as well in that."},"886":{"dur":6,"text":"(De) See how I have a harsh line there between the two colours, so I'll just pull down into that."},"892":{"dur":1,"text":"(Graeme) There you go."},"893":{"dur":4,"text":"(De) And so then. Can you help\nme lift up this one please?"},"897":{"dur":1,"text":"(Graeme) So what do I do?"},"899":{"dur":1,"text":"(De) Just grab it here and here.\n(Graeme) Here and here."},"901":{"dur":5,"text":"(De) And we lift straight up. Ta Da.\n(Graeme) Look at that.\n(De) Thank you."},"906":{"dur":6,"text":"(Graeme) That's so cool isn't it? No wonder\nhow you've got such a great three dimensional\neffects on it all and it obviously stands out now."},"913":{"dur":2,"text":"(De) See, now you know."},"915":{"dur":6,"text":"(Graeme) Now I know. I think what we might do\nis we're going to let you work on this for a\nwhile and then we'll come back later on,"},"922":{"dur":2,"text":"(Graeme) because there's obviously some\ndrying times and everything else involved."},"924":{"dur":4,"text":"(Graeme) And we'll come back in a\nlittle while and keep going with it."},"928":{"dur":2,"text":"(De) Sounds like a plan. Let's do that.\n(Graeme) Excellent. See you soon."},"979":{"dur":8,"text":"(De) So I need to mix the colours that I want\nand I'll mix the turquoise on a\nbase of white ink so that it's light."},"988":{"dur":10,"text":"(De) One of the big issues with ink painting\nis that it gets, it goes dark very, very easily.\nSo a little bit of turquoise in there."},"999":{"dur":2,"text":"(Graeme) Yeah. Oh look at that.\n(De) Near the kind of colour I'm looking for.\n(Graeme) Yeah."},"1002":{"dur":6,"text":"(De) So now I want you to do this one.\n(Graeme) Yeah. We're getting surgical now."},"1009":{"dur":8,"text":"(De) If you are someone who likes control,\nhonestly walk away now. Do not attempt\nthis technique, it is probably going to kill you."},"1017":{"dur":5,"text":"(De) That's marvelous, Graeme, that's just the\nright amount. So now I'm going to drop in some yellow,"},"1022":{"dur":12,"text":"(De) so now this is just water in my spray\nbottle. So anywhere I can see now that's dry\nbecause it won't be reflective. Just go in."},"1050":{"dur":4,"text":"(De) I want to depress the canvas\nbecause I'm quite interested in\nthis flow that's developing and"},"1055":{"dur":3,"text":"(De) I'd like to encourage it to\ncontinue out into the feathers."},"1059":{"dur":3,"text":"(De) And that's probably as much\nink as it needs I would think."},"1063":{"dur":6,"text":"(De) The hardest thing in making\nink work is to move away from the\npainting and let it sit for ten minutes."},"1069":{"dur":5,"text":"(De) And you know in my classes I say\n\u2018leave it for ten minutes\u2019 and then\nthey come back in two minutes."},"1074":{"dur":8,"text":"(De) It's not ten minutes yet, ten, this many, ten\nminutes. Then you can come back in while it's\nstill really wet you can throw some more ink in."},"1083":{"dur":5,"text":"(De) As soon as it gets thick and honey-like and\nstarts to dry, don't touch it because you'll ruin it."},"1088":{"dur":4,"text":"(Graeme) Okay. Alright well we'll\nlet this one dry then.\n(De) Okay let's."},"1104":{"dur":7,"text":"(Graeme) Well as you can see, we've taken the\npainting from flat and its dried and obviously\nas De said the colours will change and"},"1112":{"dur":2,"text":"(Graeme) they'll sort of dry in their own\ndirection.
