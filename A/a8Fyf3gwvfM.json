50?"},"333":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, thankfully, something is\nsimple in C.

let's just tease\nthis out really quickly."},"7423":{"dur":4,"text":">> It turns out that we've been doing\nmore things every time I run a program,"},"7428":{"dur":2,"text":"or every time I compile a program today."},"7430":{"dur":4,"text":"So preprocessing refers to\nthis-- anything in a C program,"},"7435":{"dur":3,"text":"as we'll see again and again,\nthat starts with this hash

happens next?"},"7475":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, the next official\nstep is compiling."},"7478":{"dur":2,"text":"And it turns out that\ncompiling a program"},"7480":{"dur":3,"text":"technically means going from\nsource code, the stuff we've"},"7484":{"dur":3,"text":"been writing today, to something\ncalled assembly code, something"},"7487":{"dur":1,"text":"that looks a little different."},"7489":{"dur":1,"text":">> And, in fact, we can see this real fast."},"7491":{"dur":2,"text":"Let me actually go into my IDE."},"7493":{"dur":4,"text":"Let me go ahead and open hello.c,

happens when\nyou compile your code."},"7554":{"dur":3,"text":"You get assembly\nlanguage out of it, which"},"7558":{"dur":6,"text":"means the third step is to assemble\nthat assembly code into,
