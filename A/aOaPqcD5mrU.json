heard,"},"57":{"dur":4,"text":"Solar System Exploration\nResearch Virtual institute."},"61":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's that last\npart, virtual Institute,"},"63":{"dur":2,"text":"that really makes us\ndifferent from a number"},"65":{"dur":4,"text":"of other activities and things\nthat you might hear about."},"70":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'm going to\ngo on in a second,"},"73":{"dur":3,"text":"but I'm want to first introduce\nto you two of our staff members"},"77":{"dur":1,"text":"that I brought with me today."},"78":{"dur":2,"text":"We have a small\ncentral office

our\ndirector of communications"},"96":{"dur":1,"text":"and public engagement."},"97":{"dur":2,"text":"So when it comes\ntime for questions,"},"100":{"dur":2,"text":"if you have any\nquestions that

deeper."},"110":{"dur":3,"text":"OK, so let me just\nstart by asking,"},"114":{"dur":1,"text":"what is a virtual Institute?"},"116":{"dur":2,"text":"For some of you, you may not\nhave heard this term before."},"119":{"dur":1,"text":"Or for those of\nyou who have, you"},"120":{"dur":1,"text":"may have a different\nidea from what"},"122":{"dur":2,"text":"it is that we\nactually do at SERVI."},"125":{"dur":3,"text":"So in our idea, a\nvirtual Institute"},"128":{"dur":2,"text":"is a distributed\norganization that"},"131":{"dur":4,"text":"allows you to pick the very\nbest investigations, teams"},"136":{"dur":3,"text":"and facilities from\nwherever they are."},"139":{"dur":3,"text":"You don't have to be restricted\nby geographical location"},"143":{"dur":3,"text":"for somebody who has a certain\ntype of laboratory working"},"146":{"dur":1,"text":"with another group\nthat might have"},"147":{"dur":4,"text":"more expertise in\nsome other area."},"155":{"dur":3,"text":"And by sharing the students,\nand the facilities,"},"158":{"dur":2,"text":"and the resources that\nthe various teams bring"},"161":{"dur":2,"text":"to the organization,\nyou can actually"},"163":{"dur":3,"text":"build a stronger\ninstitute, I maintain,"},"166":{"dur":3,"text":"than if you just had a\ntraditional bricks and mortar"},"169":{"dur":2,"text":"building."},"171":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think you get more\nbang for your buck."},"174":{"dur":3,"text":"The small office that we have\nthat NASA Ames Research Center"},"178":{"dur":3,"text":"is able to coordinate and\nhelp the collaboration,"},"181":{"dur":2,"text":"both within the teams and\nacross the team lines."},"184":{"dur":5,"text":"And we're able to do this\nacross a very interdisciplinary"},"190":{"dur":1,"text":"subject area."},"191":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'll tell you more about our\nsubject area in just a minute."},"194":{"dur":1,"text":"But first, I want to\ntell you that there"},"195":{"dur":3,"text":"is a history of virtual\ninstitutes at Ames."},"198":{"dur":4,"text":"NASA has started the NASA\nAstrobiology Institute,"},"203":{"dur":2,"text":"which began in 1998 at Ames."},"205":{"dur":1,"text":"It's still going very strong."},"207":{"dur":5,"text":"And then in 2008, the NASA Lunar\nScience Institute was born."},"212":{"dur":3,"text":"That is actually the\npredecessor for SERVI,"},"215":{"dur":2,"text":"and we have taken our\nstudies of the Moon"},"218":{"dur":3,"text":"and expanded them now to include\nstudies also of near Earth"},"222":{"dur":4,"text":"asteroids, and\nthe moons of Mars."},"226":{"dur":3,"text":"Then, we also have to NASA\nAeronautics Research Institute,"},"229":{"dur":2,"text":"which began in 2012."},"231":{"dur":4,"text":"And SERVI was just born\nlast year, well in 2013,"},"235":{"dur":3,"text":"a little over a year ago now."},"239":{"dur":3,"text":"OK, so this diagram,\nthis drawing,"},"242":{"dur":5,"text":"is indicating the orbits of most\nof the near Earth asteroids."},"247":{"dur":1,"text":"I say most because\nwe think we have"},"249":{"dur":2,"text":"found most of the large ones."},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"But there are probably still a\nfew that we don't know about."},"254":{"dur":3,"text":"And when you see that\nkind of involvement"},"258":{"dur":3,"text":"of where they are located\nrelative to the Earth,"},"261":{"dur":2,"text":"I think it becomes obvious\nwhy NASA felt the need"},"263":{"dur":4,"text":"to expand our purview to go\nbeyond studies of the Moon."},"268":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's why we now\ninclude, as it says here,"},"270":{"dur":2,"text":"the near Earth\nasteroids, and also"},"273":{"dur":1,"text":"the moons of Mars,\nwhich we believe"},"275":{"dur":3,"text":"may have been captured\nasteroids themselves."},"279":{"dur":4,"text":"This institute is funded jointly\nby both the Science Mission"},"283":{"dur":3,"text":"Directorate at NASA\nheadquarters in Washington, DC,"},"286":{"dur":4,"text":"but also the human exploration\nside what NASA does."},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, this is a\nvery important bridge"},"293":{"dur":3,"text":"to join together science\nand exploration so that you"},"297":{"dur":1,"text":"are addressing the\nscience questions you"},"299":{"dur":2,"text":"need to know before you go."},"301":{"dur":3,"text":"So before we take humans\nanywhere beyond low Earth orbit"},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"again, there are certain\nquestions we want to address."},"307":{"dur":4,"text":"And our teams are looking at\nwhat those conditions might"},"312":{"dur":4,"text":"be that will help us get\nthere, and get there safely."},"317":{"dur":3,"text":"So in more detail what\ndoes SERVI actually study?"},"321":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, we have a long\nlist of items here,"},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"but the role of\nthe Moon is still"},"328":{"dur":2,"text":"very important to what we do."},"330":{"dur":3,"text":"We study the origin,\nthe composition,"},"333":{"dur":2,"text":"the dynamics of all\nof these bodies."},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"So we'd like to know,\nin particular, what kind"},"339":{"dur":4,"text":"of questions cover\nmultiple bodies."},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"In other words, if you\nwere interested in the dust"},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"or the regolith that sits\non the Moon's surface,"},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"you might have some of\nthe very same questions"},"350":{"dur":3,"text":"that apply to the moons\nof Mars, Phobos and Deimos"},"354":{"dur":2,"text":"and similarly to asteroids."},"357":{"dur":3,"text":"And by understanding the\ncomposition of these materials,"},"360":{"dur":3,"text":"you would better be able\nto design both vehicles"},"364":{"dur":4,"text":"and environments for humans to\nlive in on any of those bodies,"},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"or even just to go there\nfor a short time to work."},"372":{"dur":0,"text":"Volatiles."},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"In its broadest sense,\nthese are materials"},"375":{"dur":4,"text":"that may be able to be\nliberated up from the surface,"},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"or ice from down deep\ninside of a crater."},"383":{"dur":1,"text":"Those are very\nimportant to us as well."},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"And they cover, again, the\nmultitude of the bodies"},"388":{"dur":1,"text":"that we study."},"390":{"dur":3,"text":"And you can read down this list\na number of the other areas"},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"that SERVI is concerned with."},"395":{"dur":3,"text":"So we put out a proposal\na little over a year"},"399":{"dur":4,"text":"ago for teams to reply to."},"403":{"dur":3,"text":"And from that, we\nselected nine teams."},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"And here are the\nprincipal investigators"},"409":{"dur":4,"text":"that make up the current\ncomposition of the SERVI"},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"Institute teams."},"415":{"dur":5,"text":"And you can see that the\nprincipal investigators, just"},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"in alphabetical\norder here, I've got"},"423":{"dur":4,"text":"to Bill Bottke who is from the\nSouthwest Research Institute,"},"427":{"dur":4,"text":"and Dan Britt, who is from the\nUniversity of Central Florida."},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"Ben Bussey from the\nApplied Physics Laboratory"},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"has just recently been\nreplaced by Andy Rivkin"},"438":{"dur":3,"text":"because Ben Bussey is now the\nchief scientist in the Human"},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"Exploration and\nMission Operations"},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"Directorate at\nNASA headquarters."},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"Then we go on to\nBill Farrell who"},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"is at the Goddard\nSpace Flight Center."},"451":{"dur":3,"text":"This is on the East Coast just\noutside of Washington, DC."},"455":{"dur":4,"text":"Tim Glotch who is at Stony\nBrook University up in New York."},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"Jennifer Heldmann from\nNASA Ames Research Center."},"463":{"dur":3,"text":"Mihaly Horanyia at the\nUniversity of Colorado,"},"467":{"dur":3,"text":"David Kring who is in Houston\nat the Lunar and Planetary"},"470":{"dur":4,"text":"Institute, and Carle\nPieters at Brown University."},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"So each one of these\nprincipal investigators"},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"put together the very\nbest team they could find."},"480":{"dur":4,"text":"They're usually somewhere around\n30 to 50 people in number."},"485":{"dur":4,"text":"And they could be located at\nthe university or facility"},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"that I just mentioned where\ntheir principal investigator"},"492":{"dur":1,"text":"is."},"493":{"dur":1,"text":"Or maybe not."},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"They themselves would\nhave a distribution"},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"across the country."},"498":{"dur":5,"text":"And all of our teams communicate\nusing the virtual technology"},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"that I'll tell you a little\nbit about in a minute."},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"And we get together once\nin a while in person,"},"509":{"dur":6,"text":"but by and large these are\nvirtual communications."},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"OK, we also have eight\ninternational partners."},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"Why would international\npartners care"},"520":{"dur":4,"text":"about joining a domestic\ngroup like NASA's SERVI?"},"525":{"dur":4,"text":"Well it turns out, through a\nno exchange of funds basis,"},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"if they become a\npartner with us,"},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"it facilitates their\ngetting the resources"},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"within their own\ncountry to develop"},"537":{"dur":1,"text":"whatever kind of\nprogram they wanted"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"to develop that's\nrelevant to what we do."},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"Perhaps it's\ninvestigating the Moon."},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"Or in the case of\nKorea, they're very"},"545":{"dur":3,"text":"interested in going to the\nMoon with a mission themselves."},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"Whatever the\ncountry interest is,"},"552":{"dur":3,"text":"if it relates to what we\ndo with our domestic teams,"},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"we are happy to entertain\na proposal from them."},"558":{"dur":1,"text":"And so far eight\nof them have been"},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"accepted into our\ninternational family."},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"And then we urge\ncross collaboration"},"565":{"dur":3,"text":"between the domestic teams\nand international partners."},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's going really well."},"571":{"dur":3,"text":"This is a distribution of where\nthe principal investigators"},"575":{"dur":4,"text":"and the co-investigators are\njust for the domestic teams."},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"And again, just to\ngive you an idea"},"580":{"dur":4,"text":"that there are a total\nof 318 researchers,"},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"including the students."},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"There are many students that\nare involved with these teams."},"588":{"dur":3,"text":"And the average team\nsize is roughly 30."},"592":{"dur":4,"text":"We have one that's\nup to 60 in number."},"597":{"dur":3,"text":"OK, so getting down to\nmore details about what"},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"these teams actually\ndo, I've selected"},"602":{"dur":1,"text":"just a few research highlights."},"604":{"dur":1,"text":"They have many."},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean each one of\nthese teams could easily"},"608":{"dur":1,"text":"take up an entire\nhour just to tell you"},"609":{"dur":1,"text":"the fascinating\nwork they're doing."},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"But let me just give\nyou a few highlights."},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"So Dan Britt at the\nUniversity of Central Florida"},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"has a team called the Center\nfor Lunar and Asteroid Surface"},"619":{"dur":1,"text":"Science."},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"And they study the\nphysical properties"},"623":{"dur":1,"text":"of regoliths, the\ndust that we've"},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"talked about on the surface\nof bodies like the Moon,"},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"but also asteroids\nand the moons of Mars."},"630":{"dur":3,"text":"The geotechnical properties,\nthe micro gravity effects"},"634":{"dur":6,"text":"that you might encounter, impact\nejecta dynamics, hydration,"},"640":{"dur":2,"text":"and weathering of the\nnear Earth asteroids."},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"Over time, the four-and-a-half\nbillion years that these bodies"},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"have been in space, there's\nbeen a lot of weathering"},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"And the charging\nand mobilization"},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"of dust on the surface\nof any of these"},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"is going to affect any machinery\nyou're going to put there,"},"657":{"dur":4,"text":"and certainly the\nastronauts themselves."},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"So then, the next\none, Andy Rivkin,"},"664":{"dur":4,"text":"the Applied Physics Laboratory\nat Johns Hopkins University."},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"Their team is called\nVORTICES, a very long name,"},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"and NASA loves its acronyms."},"674":{"dur":3,"text":"So you can see how they\ndeveloped VORTICES out"},"677":{"dur":0,"text":"of their name."},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"But they study\nvolatiles, regolith,"},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"and thermal investigations."},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"They look at the sources,\nsinks and processes"},"685":{"dur":4,"text":"and the interaction\nthat various materials"},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"will have with the\nregoliths, and the evolution"},"693":{"dur":4,"text":"of that dust on all\nof the target bodies."},"698":{"dur":3,"text":"OK, the group at the\nGoddard Space Flight Center,"},"701":{"dur":3,"text":"led by Bill Farrell, this is\ncalled the Dream Two Team."},"705":{"dur":1,"text":"And the reason it's\ncalled Dream Two"},"707":{"dur":4,"text":"is because Dream One was part\nof the NASA Lunar Science"},"711":{"dur":4,"text":"Institute, which I was also the\ndirector of in the last couple"},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"of years before it\ntransitioned into SERVI."},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"So I got to know the teams\nfrom the NASA Lunar Science"},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"Institute pretty well."},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"And I was really pleased that\nwhen we had our peer review"},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"process of the\nproposals, it turned out"},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"several of the principal\ninvestigators who"},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"had been leading teams under\nthe Lunar Science Institute"},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"were selected for SERVI."},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"So Bill Farrell\nwas one of those."},"738":{"dur":2,"text":"And the dynamic\nresponsive environments"},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"at asteroids, the Moon,\nand the moons of Mars"},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"is what he calls Dream Two."},"746":{"dur":3,"text":"They study plasmas,\nthe plasma interaction"},"749":{"dur":1,"text":"that comes from the solar wind."},"751":{"dur":1,"text":"When the solar wind\ncomes and interacts"},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"with a body like\nthe Moon, it does"},"755":{"dur":1,"text":"a number of interesting things."},"757":{"dur":4,"text":"And the fact that we now\nsee OH all over the surface"},"761":{"dur":3,"text":"of the Moon, and the solar\nwind contains hydrogen"},"765":{"dur":5,"text":"as it's traveling and runs\ninto the regolith on the Moon,"},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"you can see how the\nH and the OH can"},"772":{"dur":1,"text":"get together and form water."},"774":{"dur":3,"text":"So the plasma processes, as\nthey interact with the Moon"},"778":{"dur":2,"text":"and the other bodies,\nare very important."},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"And you can also\nsee here that we"},"783":{"dur":4,"text":"have the solar wind\ncharging of asteroids."},"787":{"dur":1,"text":"This is something\nelse that they study."},"789":{"dur":0,"text":"They model this."},"790":{"dur":4,"text":"We have a lot of\ninteresting results"},"794":{"dur":2,"text":"that show the kinds\nof things that you"},"796":{"dur":3,"text":"need to think about when\nyou're looking at the charging"},"800":{"dur":2,"text":"from these kinds\nof interactions."},"802":{"dur":4,"text":"Timothy Glotch from\nStony Brook University"},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"has a team that they\ncalled The Rise Team."},"811":{"dur":4,"text":"And they do the remote\nsensing of airless bodies."},"816":{"dur":3,"text":"Field operations and metrics\nfor human exploration,"},"820":{"dur":3,"text":"they look at the reactivity\nand the toxicity of regoliths."},"824":{"dur":1,"text":"These can be\ndangerous to humans."},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"So you know, when the\nastronauts were on the Moon,"},"828":{"dur":3,"text":"the spacesuits were\njust covered with dust."},"831":{"dur":3,"text":"And getting back\ninto the vehicle,"},"835":{"dur":3,"text":"this is a concern, because if\nyou're breathing in that dust,"},"838":{"dur":4,"text":"it turned out it was a very\nsharp, jagged kind of material."},"843":{"dur":1,"text":"And it can be really,\nreally harmful"},"845":{"dur":1,"text":"over the long period of time."},"846":{"dur":2,"text":"So they look at that\nand try and understand"},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"what we have to\nmitigate against."},"851":{"dur":2,"text":"They also do synchrotron\nanalyses of samples."},"854":{"dur":3,"text":"And they look at volcanics\nand impact crater analogue"},"858":{"dur":0,"text":"research."},"859":{"dur":3,"text":"Which means you go to places on\nthe Earth that look like good"},"862":{"dur":2,"text":"analogues for places\nyou want to go in space,"},"864":{"dur":2,"text":"and you try out some\nyour machinery and some"},"867":{"dur":5,"text":"of your techniques to see\nhow they would best work."},"872":{"dur":2,"text":"OK, continuing on\nMihaly Horanyia"},"874":{"dur":4,"text":"from the University of\nColorado, his Institute team,"},"879":{"dur":4,"text":"called Impact, has developed\nthe world's fastest dust"},"883":{"dur":1,"text":"accelerator."},"885":{"dur":4,"text":"And this is open to the\nentire scientific community"},"889":{"dur":3,"text":"and exploration community, so\nthat people can take samples"},"892":{"dur":0,"text":"there."},"893":{"dur":3,"text":"They can try out\nnew experiments."},"896":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's really going well."},"898":{"dur":2,"text":"They're doing a lot\nof phenomenal work."},"901":{"dur":3,"text":"And they have just\nbuilt a new ion"},"905":{"dur":3,"text":"gun that simulates the\nsolar wind so that they"},"908":{"dur":3,"text":"can extend this\nresearch even further."},"912":{"dur":4,"text":"And here you can see the\npenetration and the charging"},"916":{"dur":3,"text":"studies that they do as well."},"919":{"dur":4,"text":"Carle Pieters from Brown\nUniversity, her team"},"923":{"dur":2,"text":"does a lot of interesting\nstuff with the evolution"},"926":{"dur":3,"text":"and environment of\nwhatever destination"},"930":{"dur":1,"text":"we're going to go to."},"931":{"dur":2,"text":"But I'd like to really\nhighlight the work that they've"},"934":{"dur":2,"text":"done on the Moon,\nbecause I think"},"937":{"dur":2,"text":"one of the most exciting\nresults that we've learned"},"939":{"dur":3,"text":"about the Moon is the\nfact that it's so wet."},"942":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, it's wet compared to\nwhat we thought it was."},"946":{"dur":3,"text":"It was so dry a few years ago."},"950":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean we thought\nit was very dry."},"952":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's maybe about as\nwet as the Sahara Desert."},"955":{"dur":2,"text":"But that's still lot wetter\nthan that what we thought."},"958":{"dur":5,"text":"So to put it all in\nperspective, but the water"},"963":{"dur":3,"text":"is in very different locations."},"966":{"dur":3,"text":"And that indicates it came\nfrom probably at least"},"970":{"dur":2,"text":"three sources, three\ndifferent sources."},"973":{"dur":2,"text":"And the one that we\nfound inside the crater"},"975":{"dur":2,"text":"when we had the LCROSS\nmission-- I'm sure many of you"},"977":{"dur":2,"text":"would remember that a\nfew years ago in 2009."},"980":{"dur":1,"text":"This was a mission\nthat went to the Moon,"},"982":{"dur":2,"text":"deliberately crashed\ninto a crater,"},"984":{"dur":2,"text":"kicked up, excavated\na bunch of material,"},"986":{"dur":3,"text":"and then studied what\nthe composition was."},"990":{"dur":4,"text":"The LCROSS mission, which\nwas developed at Ames,"},"994":{"dur":2,"text":"revealed that we have\nwater ice in the bottom"},"996":{"dur":2,"text":"of a crater, the Cabeus crater."},"999":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, that was\ngreat confirmation."},"1001":{"dur":1,"text":"We were all very\nexcited about it."},"1003":{"dur":2,"text":"But frankly, I wasn't\nall that surprised."},"1006":{"dur":1,"text":"I kind of thought\nthere would be ice down"},"1007":{"dur":1,"text":"in the bottom of a crater."},"1009":{"dur":2,"text":"What I didn't expect\nwas that we have"},"1012":{"dur":4,"text":"water in the rocks that came\nup from deep inside the Moon"},"1016":{"dur":1,"text":"that the astronauts picked up."},"1018":{"dur":2,"text":"In the Apollo samples, it\nturns out some of those samples"},"1021":{"dur":3,"text":"that they brought back contained\nglass beads, volcanic glass"},"1024":{"dur":2,"text":"beads that could protect\nthe water inside it."},"1027":{"dur":3,"text":"And now, all these years\nlater, we have the technology,"},"1031":{"dur":3,"text":"we have the instruments to go\nback and analyze those samples"},"1034":{"dur":2,"text":"in greater depth\nand differently."},"1036":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's where we found\nquite a bit more water"},"1039":{"dur":1,"text":"than we previously thought."},"1041":{"dur":1,"text":"And then, the third\ncomponent of water I"},"1043":{"dur":5,"text":"already mentioned to you, which\nis the OH that exists literally"},"1048":{"dur":3,"text":"across the Moon in very\ndifferent terrains."},"1051":{"dur":1,"text":"And the interesting\nthing about that"},"1053":{"dur":4,"text":"is that it seems to be\nreplenished on a current cycle."},"1058":{"dur":3,"text":"This isn't just water that\nwas deposited a long time

us."},"2465":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, what we've\nlearned over the years"},"2468":{"dur":2,"text":"is that it's really\nimportant to conduct"},"2470":{"dur":5,"text":"personal one-on-one training\nbefore we have anybody present."},"2476":{"dur":3,"text":"It's important to\nprovide a checklist"},"2479":{"dur":2,"text":"so that even though they think\nthey're familiar with

real natural feel."},"2534":{"dur":3,"text":"Designate a facilitator\nfor each event."},"2538":{"dur":4,"text":"Use social media and\ndedicated online discussion"},"2542":{"dur":3,"text":"to involve and engage the online\naudience and the participants,"},"2546":{"dur":1,"text":"as well as the speaker."},"2547":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's why we like Adobe\nConnect, because you've"},"2550":{"dur":2,"text":"got that little chat box,\nthat window where people"},"2552":{"dur":1,"text":"can type in their questions."},"2554":{"dur":1,"text":"And sometimes you\nsee people

best."},"2588":{"dur":2,"text":"We try and follow those\nwith a 10-minute break."},"2590":{"dur":1,"text":"And have no more than\nthree sessions a day,"},"2592":{"dur":2,"text":"or you're going to\nlose your audience."},"2595":{"dur":4,"text":"And in conclusion, I\nthink the main takeaways"},"2599":{"dur":3,"text":"for what we've learned from\nthe virtual institute model"},"2603":{"dur":3,"text":"is that by having longer\nperiods of funding--"},"2606":{"dur":3,"text":"the five-year funding--\nthat's long for a scientists"},"2609":{"dur":3,"text":"because usually they have to\nwrite proposals for one or two,"},"2613":{"dur":1,"text":"maybe three years."},"2614":{"dur":3,"text":"And by giving them a larger\namount of funding-- the teams"},"2617":{"dur":2,"text":"each get roughly\n$1.2 million a year."},"2620":{"dur":4,"text":"And this enables them to\nthen support their students."},"2624":{"dur":1,"text":"You can support a\nstudent for five years"},"2626":{"dur":2,"text":"and get them all the way\nthrough graduate school,"},"2629":{"dur":2,"text":"if they start at the right time."},"2631":{"dur":3,"text":"But by doing this we get\nunexpected discoveries"},"2634":{"dur":4,"text":"from the interdisciplinary\nand inter-team collaboration"},"2639":{"dur":1,"text":"that comes about\nthrough this research."},"2640":{"dur":3,"text":"So the whole really is more\nthan the sum of the parts."},"2644":{"dur":2,"text":"And we see incredible\nproductivity from these teams."},"2647":{"dur":3,"text":"So we know that the taxpayer,\nall of you, all of us,"},"2650":{"dur":2,"text":"are getting a lot of\nbang for you buck."},"2653":{"dur":3,"text":"The ability to assemble the\nbest possible team regardless"},"2656":{"dur":2,"text":"of where they're\ngeographically located,"},"2658":{"dur":2,"text":"and the cost savings\nthat you get, obviously,"},"2661":{"dur":2,"text":"by not having to\ntravel everywhere,"},"2663":{"dur":3,"text":"both in time and\nenergy, really, I think,"},"2666":{"dur":2,"text":"gets that productivity up."},"2668":{"dur":2,"text":"And the long-term\nstability for the students,"},"2670":{"dur":3,"text":"our future workforce, this\nis so important to all of us."},"2673":{"dur":3,"text":"So with that, I think\nthat's everything I brought."},"2676":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'm happy to\nanswer any questions."},"2680":{"dur":3,"text":"And we've got, of course,\nBrian Day and Brad Bailey"},"2683":{"dur":3,"text":"here as well that

actually"},"2698":{"dur":1,"text":"has tried this as well."},"2699":{"dur":2,"text":"I think their model is\nslightly different from ours."},"2702":{"dur":2,"text":"But I do believe\nNASA was the first."},"2705":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think with the NASA\nAstrobiology Institute,"},"2708":{"dur":3,"text":"they have the longest running\nhistory, from 1998 to now."},"2712":{"dur":1,"text":"And they are going strong."},"2714":{"dur":3,"text":"So we took a lot of our\ncues from what the NAI did."},"2717":{"dur":5,"text":"And I think the NSF, it\nprobably learned a bit"},"2722":{"dur":2,"text":"from what NASA did as well."},"2725":{"dur":2,"text":"But I don't know of\nother organizations."},"2728":{"dur":3,"text":"I can tell you that both the\nOffice of

ago,"},"2736":{"dur":2,"text":"they asked me to get them\na presentation as well,"},"2738":{"dur":1,"text":"because they're looking\nat how this might"},"2740":{"dur":2,"text":"apply to other\ngovernment agencies."},"2742":{"dur":4,"text":"So you might see more virtual\ninstitutes in the future."},"2746":{"dur":3,"text":"AUDIENCE: So what's the\ntypical collaboration schedule"},"2749":{"dur":1,"text":"for many of these\ncollaborations."},"2751":{"dur":2,"text":"Do they all get together\nlike weekly or monthly,"},"2754":{"dur":4,"text":"or is it just like the

meeting"},"2778":{"dur":2,"text":"that they have with us\nat the central office."},"2780":{"dur":2,"text":"All the PIs get\ntogether and report"},"2782":{"dur":2,"text":"on what their teams have\nbeen doing once a month."},"2784":{"dur":2,"text":"But within their team, they\ndo at least once a month,"},"2787":{"dur":2,"text":"some of them on a weekly basis."},"2789":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think it really depends\non whether their people are all"},"2793":{"dur":2,"text":"co-located in one place, or\nwhether they're spread out"},"2796":{"dur":3,"text":"and they need to tag up\nwith them around there."},"2799":{"dur":1,"text":"But one of the\nthings that we think"},"2801":{"dur":3,"text":"is very important in running\nthe virtual institute"},"2804":{"dur":3,"text":"is not to over constrain\nwhat the teams do."},"2807":{"dur":2,"text":"As a scientist myself,\nI know that I really"},"2810":{"dur":3,"text":"appreciate the leadership\ngetting the obstacles out"},"2814":{"dur":2,"text":"of the way and letting\nme get my job done."},"2816":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's what we're trying\nto do with the teams as well."},"2819":{"dur":2,"text":"So when they have new\ndirections, new ideas that they"},"2821":{"dur":1,"text":"want to go down, they\ndon't have to check in"},"2823":{"dur":2,"text":"with us every\nminute of every day."},"2825":{"dur":1,"text":"If it's a major\nredirect, we'd like"},"2827":{"dur":2,"text":"them to talk to\nus about it first."},"2829":{"dur":3,"text":"But in general,\nif all they do is"},"2832":{"dur":1,"text":"what they wrote\nin their proposal,"},"2834":{"dur":1,"text":"we would be disappointed."},"2835":{"dur":2,"text":"Because we know that new\nscience, and new

important\nmessage to take away here also"},"2886":{"dur":2,"text":"is that virtual is\nnot always the answer."},"2889":{"dur":2,"text":"And there are some\nreally important reasons"},"2892":{"dur":3,"text":"and situations where you want\nto have that face-to-face."},"2895":{"dur":4,"text":"And I know from the\nteam activities,"},"2900":{"dur":2,"text":"my husband, who is also\na planetary scientist,"},"2902":{"dur":1,"text":"has been on several teams."},"2903":{"dur":2,"text":"And I've watched\nwhat they have to do"},"2906":{"dur":1,"text":"and the way that they\nhave
