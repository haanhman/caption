that causes\nthe reverse magnus effect?"},"181":{"dur":1,"text":"So the key to\nthe reverse magnus"},"182":{"dur":2,"text":"effect is in the\nthin layer of air"},"184":{"dur":1,"text":"right next to the\nsurface of the ball,"},"186":{"dur":1,"text":"or what we call\nthe boundary layer."},"187":{"dur":2,"text":"So the boundary layer can\ncome in two basic varieties."},"190":{"dur":1,"text":"You can have a laminar\nboundary layer,"},"192":{"dur":1,"text":"or you can have a\nturbulent boundary layer."},"194":{"dur":2,"text":"So a laminar flow is\nsmooth and orderly,"},"196":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's like what\nyou get when you first"},"198":{"dur":1,"text":"turn the water faucet on."},"199":{"dur":1,"text":"And turbulent flow\nis what you get"},"201":{"dur":1,"text":"when you turn the\nfaucet on higher,"},"202":{"dur":1,"text":"and it gets all\ncrazy and chaotic."},"204":{"dur":1,"text":"And on a soccer\nball that's rough,"},"206":{"dur":2,"text":"it's typically turbulent?"},"208":{"dur":0,"text":"Yes."},"209":{"dur":2,"text":"But if you had a really\nsmooth ball instead,"},"211":{"dur":2,"text":"that boundary layer\nmight switch from being"},"213":{"dur":1,"text":"turbulent to being laminar."},"215":{"dur":1,"text":"So looking at our\nspinning ball again,"},"217":{"dur":2,"text":"we can see that air\nflowing over the top"},"219":{"dur":3,"text":"is moving in the same direction\nas the spin of the ball."},"222":{"dur":1,"text":"That means the\nvelocity difference"},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"between the air at the\nsurface of the ball"},"226":{"dur":2,"text":"and the air a little ways away\nis going to be very small."},"229":{"dur":1,"text":"So our boundary\nlayer here on top"},"230":{"dur":1,"text":"is going to become\nlaminar sooner"},"232":{"dur":2,"text":"than the boundary layer on\nthe bottom, where the air is"},"234":{"dur":1,"text":"moving against the spin."},"235":{"dur":1,"text":"That laminar boundary\nlayer on the top"},"237":{"dur":2,"text":"is not as good at\nsticking to the ball,"},"239":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's actually going to\nseparate right here at the top."},"242":{"dur":1,"text":"On the bottom of\nthe ball, the air"},"244":{"dur":3,"text":"is still moving fast relative\nto the surface of the ball,"},"247":{"dur":2,"text":"so that boundary layer is\ngoing to stay turbulent."},"249":{"dur":1,"text":"Turbulent boundary\nlayers are better"},"250":{"dur":1,"text":"at sticking to the\ncurve of the ball,"},"252":{"dur":2,"text":"so it's going to follow the\ncurve of the ball around,"},"255":{"dur":1,"text":"and be deflected upward."},"257":{"dur":2,"text":"Since the overall deflection\nof air around the ball"},"259":{"dur":3,"text":"is now upward, that means the\nball is going to move downward."},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"Which is the exact\nopposite of what we saw"},"265":{"dur":1,"text":"with the regular magnus effect."},"266":{"dur":1,"text":"It's the reverse magnus effect."},"268":{"dur":2,"text":"So the reverse\nmagnus effect happens"},"270":{"dur":3,"text":"because of this super sensitive\nboundary layer transition"},"273":{"dur":1,"text":"from turbulent to laminar."},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"It's so sensitive that\neven little changes"},"278":{"dur":1,"text":"can affect the ball's flight."},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"We did some experiments\nhere at MIT, a grad student,"},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"she looked at the influence of\nroughness on the magnus effect."},"285":{"dur":1,"text":"So we basically\ntook a beach ball,"},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"and it indeed bent\nthe wrong way."},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"And then if you put an\nelastic band around it,"},"290":{"dur":3,"text":"then you get-- it basically\nreverses the sign of the force."},"294":{"dur":2,"text":"So of course we\nhad to try this."},"296":{"dur":3,"text":"And with the rubber band we\nsaw some unusual behaviors."},"299":{"dur":2,"text":"Dan Walsh, our drone\noperator, who's"},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"also a grad student\nat UCSD in physics,"},"304":{"dur":1,"text":"analyzed the trajectories\nof these balls"},"305":{"dur":1,"text":"using a program called Tracker."},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"For one of the plates with the\nrubber band we got this path."},"310":{"dur":1,"text":"So the tiny rubber\nband is enough to cause"},"312":{"dur":2,"text":"the magnus effect to\nflip back and forth."},"314":{"dur":1,"text":"He also found some\ninteresting things,"},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"like the acceleration due\nto the magnus effect on some"},"318":{"dur":3,"text":"of these kicks was comparable\nto gravity for the lighter ball."},"321":{"dur":1,"text":"That's amazing."},"322":{"dur":1,"text":"It's all about those\nboundary layers."},"324":{"dur":2,"text":"So that was the\nreverse magnus effect."},"326":{"dur":3,"text":"Thank you so much to Nicole for\njoining me to help explain it."},"329":{"dur":0,"text":"That was
