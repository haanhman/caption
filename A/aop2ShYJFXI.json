want\nme to come to it."},"274":{"dur":2,"text":"And we hadn't started\nshooting the movie yet"},"277":{"dur":3,"text":"and I think that we needed\nsomething to show people."},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"We needed to give people a sense\nof what the movie was going"},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"to be-- and since all the things\nthat we were talking

people"},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"a sense of the movie and the\nstory that we're telling."},"313":{"dur":0,"text":"KEVIN VLK: Interesting."},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"So what was the process of\nweaving in kind of, you know,"},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"history and real-life\nelements with a sci-fi film,"},"319":{"dur":2,"text":"because the movie is based\non obviously a Disney

land"},"328":{"dur":3,"text":"and so it's a lot more\nwispy what it's about."},"331":{"dur":3,"text":"For us, I mean, it's not\nabout the theme park at all."},"335":{"dur":3,"text":"It's about what does\nthat world mean to you?"},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"What does that word mean to you?"},"340":{"dur":3,"text":"Tomorrow is an ephemeral word."},"343":{"dur":3,"text":"It's vague, but it's

there is something happens."},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think we were\nmore in pursuit"},"357":{"dur":3,"text":"of how do we wrap a story\naround that something that"},"361":{"dur":1,"text":"could happen."},"362":{"dur":1,"text":"KEVIN VLK: Interesting."},"363":{"dur":1,"text":"So you have lot of\nexperience, Brad,"},"365":{"dur":4,"text":"because you went from\ndoing original

\"Incredibles 2\""},"375":{"dur":0,"text":"and that's a sequel."},"376":{"dur":1,"text":"But what was it\nlike kind of going"},"378":{"dur":1,"text":"You just kind of take\nthe name \"Tomorrowland\""},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"but you're doing a completely\noriginal world in live-action."},"383":{"dur":0,"text":"How was that transition?"},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"BRAD BIRD: Well, that was\njust really exciting to me,"},"387":{"dur":6,"text":"I mean because I make a point\nof kind of regularly saying"},"393":{"dur":1,"text":"that I think the movie\nindustry dedicates"},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"too much bandwidth,\nbig budget bandwidth,"},"398":{"dur":4,"text":"to ideas that are too--\nthat are familiar."},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"I think people\nsimplify that into, oh,"},"405":{"dur":1,"text":"he doesn't like sequels."},"406":{"dur":1,"text":"It's obvious that\nI like sequels."},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"I just did one, I'm\nabout to do another one."},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"Some of my favorite\nmovies are sequels."},"412":{"dur":4,"text":"But a lot of my favorite\nexperiences in movie theaters"},"417":{"dur":2,"text":"are films where I don't\nknow what's going to happen"},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"and in \"Star Wars\"\nat one point was"},"422":{"dur":3,"text":"a really weird, radical idea\nthat very few people got,"},"426":{"dur":3,"text":"and George Lucas had to\nfight every step of the way"},"429":{"dur":1,"text":"to get it made."},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"\"E.T\" I don't think people\nwere ready for-- I mean,"},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"they clearly were\nready for, but they"},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"didn't know what it was\nwhen it first came out."},"437":{"dur":1,"text":"And those are\nwonderful experiences"},"439":{"dur":3,"text":"to have at a movie theater."},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"And when Damon mentioned\nthis idea to me,"},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"I was leaning forward."},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"I wanted to know\nabout this place"},"449":{"dur":1,"text":"and what could happen there."},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I was really\nhappy to join."},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"KEVIN VLK: So was there any\npressure from the studio,"},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"just kind of to incorporate\nmore Tomorrowland, like Space"},"458":{"dur":0,"text":"Mountain, stuff like that?"},"459":{"dur":1,"text":"Was just kind of like, no?"},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"DAMON LINDELOF: It was that\nit was actually the opposite."},"463":{"dur":1,"text":"I think early on,\nwe said, hey, just"},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"so you know,\nthere's probably not"},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"going to be a Space\nMountain in this movie,"},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"because it does feel\nlike it's the thing you"},"470":{"dur":0,"text":"need to check off."},"471":{"dur":3,"text":"And again, to go back to\n\"Pirates of the

and\nyou kind of go, like, oh,"},"481":{"dur":1,"text":"that's from the\nride, but you know"},"483":{"dur":1,"text":"it's more of wink and a nod--"},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"BRAD BIRD: Actually, Space\nMountain makes a glimpse."},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"DAMON LINDELOF: Yes, right."},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"You see the structure,\nbut there's no like piece."},"489":{"dur":0,"text":"BRAD BIRD: Right."},"490":{"dur":0,"text":"Right."},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"But I think that ultimately,\nespecially when you're"},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"talking about a new piece of\nIP or an original movie, we"},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"actually-- we don't need to\nsell tickets to the park."},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"The park needs to sell\ntickets to \"Tomorrowland.\""},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"And so they were completely\nand totally on board"},"504":{"dur":1,"text":"with that idea."},"505":{"dur":0,"text":"KEVIN VLK: That's great."},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"And so was there I think the\nvisuals stills, though-- you"},"509":{"dur":1,"text":"kind of took a\nlot of the visuals"},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"from Tomorrowland, which\nwas awesome, I thought."},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"BRAD BIRD: It's more\nof a feeling, yeah"},"514":{"dur":0,"text":"KEVIN VLK: Yeah."},"515":{"dur":2,"text":"BRAD BIRD: But,\nagain, we were not--"},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"they were incredibly\nsupportive of us"},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"being free-range chickens."},"521":{"dur":1,"text":"DAMON LINDELOF: No,\nand I-- Tomorrowland"},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"is one of my-- we're\nfree-range chickens?"},"525":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah."},"526":{"dur":3,"text":"But Tomorrowland is one of my\nfavorite parts of the park,"},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"but I do think that even\nfrom when I first went there"},"533":{"dur":3,"text":"when I was 11 years old, it's\nalways struggled with identity"},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"in terms of is it the\nJules Verne Tomorrowland"},"539":{"dur":3,"text":"that's sort of based in\nthe late 19th century?"},"542":{"dur":2,"text":"BRAD BIRD: Well-- I think\nthe thing that's interesting"},"545":{"dur":5,"text":"about it is Disney\nessentially designed"},"551":{"dur":3,"text":"that one section of the\npark to be perpetually"},"554":{"dur":3,"text":"frustrating to businessmen,\nbecause you can never"},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"be done with tomorrow."},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"Tomorrow is always in\nmotion, and so it's"},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"the one part of the park\nthat's going to go out-of-date"},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"relatively quickly if you\ndon't keep reinventing it."},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think during\nthe Eisner era,"},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"they dealt with it by like,\ncan't we just be done?"},"573":{"dur":0,"text":"You know."},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"They dealt with it by\nputting it in the past"},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"and hopefully we're done."},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think that kind of,\nnow, there's an impatience"},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"to do something new with it."},"583":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean, you go into Imagineering\nand they're chomping at the bit"},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"to reinvent it because\nI think they're"},"589":{"dur":4,"text":"more you know excited\nabout the Walt idea"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"where it's continually coming."},"595":{"dur":4,"text":"It's not \"a galaxy\nfar, far away.\""},"600":{"dur":4,"text":"It's something that actually\nmay happen and it's coming."},"605":{"dur":1,"text":"And, you know, I\nthink that they're"},"607":{"dur":1,"text":"invigorated by that idea."},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"And listen I would love\na Star Wars land as well,"},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"but I don't think\nit's the same thing."},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"I think there's Star Wars\nLand and there's Tomorrowland."},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"And they're separate things,\nthey do separate things,"},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"and I would be\nexcited about both."},"620":{"dur":1,"text":"DAMON LINDELOF:\nAnd I think what's"},"621":{"dur":1,"text":"crazy is if you think\nabout the

in animation\nexclusively, everybody"},"667":{"dur":3,"text":"kept talking about how\nit felt like live-action."},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"And then you go into live-action\nand they go, well,

something"},"3402":{"dur":2,"text":"and you want to lay a\nlittle track for it."},"3405":{"dur":3,"text":"DAMON LINDELOF: Yeah, I think\nthe first phase of storytelling"},"3408":{"dur":2,"text":"was that we wanted\nto sell wonder."},"3410":{"dur":2,"text":"And the first trailer\nwas really just as simple"},"3413":{"dur":2,"text":"as this young woman\ntouching a pin"},"3415":{"dur":2,"text":"and seeing this place and\nGeorge Clooney saying,"},"3417":{"dur":3,"text":"do you want to go, with no\nsense of what the story was."},"3420":{"dur":1,"text":"But we eventually\nevolved to a point"},"3422":{"dur":3,"text":"where people, we wanted to\ntell them a little bit more"},"3426":{"dur":2,"text":"about the story, most\nimportantly that if you want"},"3428":{"dur":2,"text":"to get to this place, there's\ngoing to be an obstacle,"},"3430":{"dur":0,"text":"there's going to\nbe an impediment."},"3431":{"dur":1,"text":"Because a place\nlike this is going"},"3433":{"dur":2,"text":"to have people who don't\nwant you to come in."},"3435":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that piece\nof storytelling,"},"3437":{"dur":3,"text":"this whole sequence that

obviously,"},"3446":{"dur":4,"text":"certainly to a broader audience,\nthat's massively appealing."},"3450":{"dur":2,"text":"But as Brad said, it\ndoesn't give anything away."},"3453":{"dur":1,"text":"It doesn't spoil\nany of the surprise."},"3455":{"dur":2,"text":"BRAD BIRD: Yeah, I\nthink the quick way"},"3458":{"dur":2,"text":"to describe the story is\nthat a girl touches a pin,"},"3461":{"dur":1,"text":"she shown a place\nthat is amazing."},"3462":{"dur":2,"text":"And then the pin stops\nworking and she wants"},"3465":{"dur":1,"text":"to get back to that
