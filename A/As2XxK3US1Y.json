He says \"the"},"139":{"dur":4,"text":"kingdoms of this world ARE BECOME\", meaning\nthat they have JUST NOW become the kingdoms"},"144":{"dur":6,"text":"of our Lord and of his Christ. That shows\nthat we are going into the millennium. So,"},"150":{"dur":7,"text":"in chapter 12, all of a sudden, we're jumping\nback in time to the birth of Christ.

Then in chapter\n12, all of a sudden we jump back in time and"},"170":{"dur":4,"text":"we are at the birth of Christ, and basically,\nwhat's going to happen now is that from chapter"},"175":{"dur":6,"text":"12 onward, we are going to see the whole story\nall over again of everything that we saw in"},"181":{"dur":3,"text":"chapters 1 through 11. We're going to see\nthe tribulation all over again. We're going"},"184":{"dur":2,"text":"to see the rapture once again, we're going\nto see the rapture once again, we're going"},"186":{"dur":5,"text":"to see God pour out his wrath once again.\nAnd so the book of Revelation is in chronological"},"192":{"dur":5,"text":"order, but you have to split it in half. Chapters\n1-11 are in chronological order, chapters"},"197":{"dur":6,"text":"12 through 22 are in chronological order.\nNow let me prove to you that the seventh trumpet"},"204":{"dur":5,"text":"sounding is the END of God pouring out His\nwrath, and the beginning of the millennial"},"209":{"dur":4,"text":"reign of Jesus Christ. Because some people\ndon't believe that. They believe that the"},"213":{"dur":4,"text":"vials come after the trumpets; they believe\nthat the trumpet judgements take place, and"},"217":{"dur":4,"text":"then the vials come after. But go to Revelation\nchapter 16, and I will show you why that simply"},"222":{"dur":4,"text":"cannot be the case. There are MANY reasons\nwhy that cannot be the case, and I am going"},"227":{"dur":5,"text":"to go over those more on my sermon on chapter\n16. But just one thing to throw out there,"},"232":{"dur":5,"text":"is Revelation chapter 16 verse 10. This is\nthe fifth vial. It says \"And the fifth angel"},"238":{"dur":5,"text":"poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast;\nand his kingdom was full of darkness; and"},"243":{"dur":5,"text":"they gnawed their tongues for pain\". So, whose\nkingdom was full of darkness when the fifth"},"248":{"dur":6,"text":"vial was poured out? It says that the vial\nwas poured out upon the seat of the BEAST,"},"254":{"dur":5,"text":"and his kingdom was full of darkness. The\nbeast's kingdom is full of darkness with the"},"260":{"dur":4,"text":"outpouring of the fifth vial. Well what does\nit say at the seventh trumpet? \"The kingdoms"},"264":{"dur":5,"text":"of this world ARE BECOME the kingdoms of our\nLord and of his Christ, and he shall reign"},"270":{"dur":6,"text":"forever and ever.\" Which proves that the fifth\nvial comes before the seventh trumpet, because"},"276":{"dur":4,"text":"of the fact that the trumpets and the vials\nare happening concurrently, or at the same"},"281":{"dur":5,"text":"time. Basically, the way it goes is, the first\ntrumpet sounds, then the first vial is poured"},"286":{"dur":5,"text":"out. Second trumpet, second vial. Third trumpet,\nthird vial. Fourth trumpet, fourth vial. Fifth"},"291":{"dur":6,"text":"trumpet, fifth vial. Sixth trumpet, sixth\nvial. Seventh trumpet and seventh vial take"},"297":{"dur":5,"text":"place at the same time. And I am going to\ngo over that in great detail in chapter 16."},"303":{"dur":4,"text":"But right there is the evidence, or one of\nthe many pieces of evidence that the book"},"307":{"dur":4,"text":"of Revelation breaks down in this way. Now,\nit's interesting because when we start out"},"311":{"dur":5,"text":"the book or Revelation in chapter 1, we're\nin the first century AD, because John is on"},"317":{"dur":4,"text":"the isle of Patmos. And he is speaking to\nthese seven churches that are in the first"},"321":{"dur":5,"text":"century AD. Then, he is transported up to\nheaven to see the things which shall be hereafter,"},"327":{"dur":5,"text":"and he begins to see future events of the\ntribulation, of God's wrath being poured out."},"333":{"dur":6,"text":"Well, chapter 12 starts out really in the\nsame place in the sense that it's the same"},"339":{"dur":5,"text":"century because chapter 12 starts out in the\nfirst century AD. Just like chapter 1 did."},"345":{"dur":4,"text":"Because the birth of Christ is what is discussed.\nThen we go into the tribulation, God's wrath"},"350":{"dur":4,"text":"etc. But let's break this down, and let me\nfirst of all show you conclusively that this"},"354":{"dur":5,"text":"is Jesus Christ being mentioned in Revelation\nchapter 12. It says in verse 1, \"And there"},"359":{"dur":5,"text":"appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman\nclothed with the sun, and the moon under her"},"365":{"dur":3,"text":"feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve\nstars\". And we're going to talk about the"},"368":{"dur":4,"text":"identity of the woman in a moment. But look\nat verse 2. \"And she being with child\"- \"with"},"373":{"dur":6,"text":"child\" means pregnant- \"she being with child\ncried, travailing in birth, and pained to"},"379":{"dur":4,"text":"be delivered. And there appeared another wonder\nin heaven; and behold a great red dragon,"},"384":{"dur":5,"text":"having seven heads and ten horns, and seven\ncrowns upon his heads. And his tail drew the"},"389":{"dur":4,"text":"third part of the stars of heaven, and did\ncast them to the earth: and the dragon stood"},"394":{"dur":7,"text":"before the woman which was ready to be delivered,\nfor to devour her child as soon as it was"},"401":{"dur":5,"text":"born.\" Now how does that relate to the birth\nof Christ? The dragon or Satan as he is identified"},"407":{"dur":5,"text":"as later in this chapter is ready to devour\nthis child as soon as this child is born."},"412":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, do you remember when Jesus Christ was\nborn, and king Herod wanted to kill Jesus"},"418":{"dur":5,"text":"Christ? Now, obviously king Herod was Satan's\nminion. He was a very evil, very wicked man."},"423":{"dur":5,"text":"And he wanted to slay the Lord Jesus Christ.\nAnd so he tells the wise men when they're"},"428":{"dur":4,"text":"sent to go find the baby Jesus, he says \"Go\nand search diligently for the young child;"},"433":{"dur":4,"text":"and when ye have found him, bring me word\nagain, that I may come and worship him also.\""},"437":{"dur":5,"text":"He had no intention of worshipping Jesus Christ.\nHe wanted to go and KILL Jesus Christ. Well,"},"443":{"dur":5,"text":"the three wise men were warned of God in a\ndream that they should NOT return to Herod,"},"448":{"dur":4,"text":"and they went back to their own country another\nway. Then Herod when he saw that he was mocked"},"453":{"dur":6,"text":"of the wise men, he sent forth and slew all\nthe children that were in Bethlehem, and in"},"459":{"dur":5,"text":"all the coasts thereof, from 2 years old and\nunder. And so this was a VERY wicked man that"},"465":{"dur":7,"text":"just murdered a whole slew of innocent little\nchildren two years old and under. But what"},"472":{"dur":5,"text":"was his goal? To kill the Lord Jesus Christ.\nNow how did Jesus escape that death of all"},"478":{"dur":4,"text":"the children under 2 years old that were slain?\nWell, an angel of God appeared to Joseph in"},"483":{"dur":4,"text":"a dream, and warned him to arise and take\nthe young child and his mother by night, and"},"488":{"dur":4,"text":"to depart into Egypt, and to remain there\nuntil the death of Herod. So Jesus as a little"},"493":{"dur":6,"text":"baby was brought to the land of Egypt and\nremained there until the death of Herod and"},"499":{"dur":4,"text":"then his whole family returned and they came\nand dwelt in Nazareth. So that fits in perfectly"},"504":{"dur":5,"text":"with Revelation 12:4 about the dragon seeking\nto devour the child as soon as it's born."},"509":{"dur":6,"text":"Verse 5, \"And she brought forth a man child\nwhich was to rule all nations with a rod of"},"515":{"dur":5,"text":"iron.\" Obviously this is a reference to Jesus\nChrist. In Psalm chapter 2 verse 8, the Bible"},"521":{"dur":5,"text":"says \"Ask of me, and I shall give thee the\nheathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost"},"526":{"dur":4,"text":"parts of the earth for thy possession. Thou\nshalt break them with a rod of iron; thou"},"531":{"dur":5,"text":"shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's\nvessel.\" The context of that chapter is \"thou"},"536":{"dur":4,"text":"art my son, this day have I begotten thee\",\nwhich is quoted about the Lord Jesus Christ"},"541":{"dur":6,"text":"in Acts 13 and elsewhere. And so Psalm 2 is\na prophecy about Jesus Christ ruling the nations"},"547":{"dur":5,"text":"and breaking them with the rod of iron. Then\nin Revelation 19, verse 15, when the Bible"},"553":{"dur":4,"text":"talks about Jesus Christ returning on a white\nhorse for the battle of Armageddon, the Bible"},"558":{"dur":5,"text":"reads \"And out of his mouth goeth a sharp\nsword, that with it he should smite the nations:"},"563":{"dur":5,"text":"and he shall rule them with a rod of iron:\nand he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness"},"569":{"dur":4,"text":"and wrath of Almighty God.\" So Jesus Christ\nis described in both the Old Testament and"},"574":{"dur":4,"text":"in the New Testament as ruling all nations\nwith a rod of iron. So the man-child can be"},"579":{"dur":5,"text":"none other than Jesus Christ, the child who\nis born to rule all nations with a rod of"},"584":{"dur":5,"text":"iron. And then it says at the end of verse\n5, \"and her child was caught up unto God,"},"589":{"dur":5,"text":"and to his throne.\" This is referring to the\nascension of Jesus Christ. Remember in Acts"},"594":{"dur":5,"text":"chapter 1, he ascended up to heaven and a\ncloud received him out of their sight? And"},"599":{"dur":5,"text":"the Bible says that at this time he is seated\nat the right hand of the Father. So he was"},"604":{"dur":4,"text":"caught up unto God and to his throne, and\nhe will come again to judge the quick and"},"609":{"dur":5,"text":"the dead. And so in Revelation 12 we start\nout the chapter with the birth of Christ."},"614":{"dur":4,"text":"So, before we get into the rest of the chapter,\nthe question is, \"who is the woman?\" And there"},"618":{"dur":5,"text":"has been a lot of debate about this, because\nmany have said that the woman is Mary, because"},"624":{"dur":5,"text":"obviously Mary did give birth to the Lord\nJesus Christ. So I can see where someone would"},"629":{"dur":5,"text":"look at this and say \"ok, this could be Mary,\nit's a woman that's giving birth to Jesus,"},"635":{"dur":5,"text":"that makes sense.\" Others have said that the\nwoman represents the nation of Israel. Go"},"640":{"dur":5,"text":"back to Genesis chapter number 37 and I will\nshow you why people believe that this is the"},"645":{"dur":6,"text":"nation of Israel being pictured by the woman.\nAnd really I have scoured the Bible on this"},"652":{"dur":5,"text":"subject, I have studied every part of the\nBible looking for clues on this subject, and"},"657":{"dur":4,"text":"I feel that I have left no stone unturned.\nThis is really the only piece of evidence"},"662":{"dur":6,"text":"that I could really find to state that this\ncould be Israel being referred to. And I'll"},"668":{"dur":4,"text":"tell you right now, I do not believe that\nthe woman is either the virgin Mary OR Israel."},"672":{"dur":4,"text":"I will tell you what I believe in a moment.\nBut let me just show you all the evidence"},"677":{"dur":4,"text":"so you can decide for yourself. This is what\npeople lean on who believe that the woman"},"681":{"dur":4,"text":"there is Israel. It says in verse number 9,\n\"And he dreamed yet another dream\"- this is"},"685":{"dur":4,"text":"talking about Joseph dreaming a dream- \"and\ntold it his brethren, and said, Behold, I"},"689":{"dur":4,"text":"have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the\nsun and the moon and the eleven stars made"},"694":{"dur":4,"text":"obeisance to me. And he told it to his father,\nand to his brethren: and his father rebuked"},"698":{"dur":4,"text":"him, and said unto him, What is this dream\nthat thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother"},"703":{"dur":4,"text":"and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves\nto thee to the earth? And his brethren envied"},"708":{"dur":5,"text":"him; but his father observed the saying.\"\nSo right there, basically Joseph is having"},"713":{"dur":5,"text":"a dream about his father, and who is his father?\nJacob, who is later renamed Israel. So, his"},"718":{"dur":7,"text":"father and his mother and his eleven brethren\nare worshipping him, but they are seen in"},"725":{"dur":6,"text":"the dream as basically the sun, moon and eleven\nstars. So because of that dream that Joseph"},"732":{"dur":4,"text":"had, people will often look at Revelation\nchapter 12, and they see a woman clothed with"},"736":{"dur":4,"text":"the sun, the moon under her feet and upon\nher head a crown of 12 stars and they connect"},"741":{"dur":5,"text":"that with Genesis 37, and they say this is\nthe nation of Israel being referred to. And"},"747":{"dur":3,"text":"it's not a bad theory, I mean I can see where\nthey're coming from, there is some support"},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"for it, but honestly, I do not believe it\nfor one second. And the more that I study"},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"this, and the more that I've looked at this,\nthe more it becomes clear to me that that"},"757":{"dur":4,"text":"is not the proper interpretation of this passage.\nLet me explain to you a lot of the reasons"},"762":{"dur":7,"text":"why. First of all, jump down if you would\nto verse 13 of Revelation chapter 12. And"},"769":{"dur":4,"text":"what we're going to see in verses 13 through\n17 is a little bit of the enmity and a little"},"774":{"dur":5,"text":"bit of this battle that's going on between\nthe serpent and the woman. The serpent desires"},"779":{"dur":5,"text":"to kill the woman. The serpent is persecuting\nthe woman. Look if you would at Revelation"},"784":{"dur":4,"text":"12:13. \"And when the dragon saw that he was\ncast unto the earth\"- talking about Satan"},"788":{"dur":5,"text":"being cast out of heaven, also discussed in\nDaniel 12, it says \"when the dragon saw that"},"793":{"dur":3,"text":"he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted\nthe woman which brought forth the man child,"},"797":{"dur":4,"text":"and to the woman were given two wings of a\ngreat eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness"},"801":{"dur":5,"text":"into her place where she is nourished for\na time and times and half a time from the"},"806":{"dur":5,"text":"face of the serpent.\" So the dragon is setting\nout to persecute the woman, she flees into"},"812":{"dur":5,"text":"the wilderness to escape, and it says that\nshe is nourished from the face of the serpent."},"817":{"dur":3,"text":"So notice how the term \"dragon\" and \"serpent\"\nare being used interchangeably. Then it says"},"821":{"dur":4,"text":"in verse 15, \"And the serpent cast out of\nhis mouth water as a flood after the woman,"},"826":{"dur":3,"text":"that he might cause her to be carried away\nof the flood. And the earth helped the woman,"},"829":{"dur":4,"text":"and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed\nup the flood which the dragon cast out of"},"833":{"dur":4,"text":"his mouth. And the dragon was wroth with the\nwoman, and went to make war with the remnant"},"838":{"dur":4,"text":"of her seed, which keep the commandments of\nGod, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.\""},"843":{"dur":5,"text":"So what we see here is that the serpent is\ntrying to destroy the woman. And the woman"},"848":{"dur":5,"text":"escapes. So because the woman escapes into\nthe wilderness and is out of his reach, he"},"853":{"dur":4,"text":"sends water as a flood out of his mouth after\nthe woman that he might cause her to be carried"},"858":{"dur":4,"text":"away of the flood. But the earth helps the\nwoman; the earth opens her mouth and swallows"},"862":{"dur":5,"text":"up the flood which the dragon casts out of\nhis mouth. And then at the end of the chapter"},"867":{"dur":3,"text":"there in verse 17, it says \"the dragon was\nwroth with the woman\"- angry with the woman,"},"871":{"dur":6,"text":"it says. \"And went to make war with the remnant\nof her seed which keep the commandments of"},"878":{"dur":7,"text":"God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.\nSo, go back to Genesis chapter 3. And I believe"},"885":{"dur":6,"text":"that what you're going to see in Genesis chapter\n3 is a much stronger correlation with what"},"891":{"dur":5,"text":"we see in Revelation 12 than Joseph's dream.\nAnd I'm going to show you a few reasons why"},"897":{"dur":5,"text":"this is such a stronger correlation, why this\nmakes so much more sense. In Genesis chapter"},"902":{"dur":5,"text":"3 verse 14, the Bible reads \"And the LORD\nGod said unto the serpent, Because thou hast"},"908":{"dur":5,"text":"done this, thou art cursed above all cattle,\nand above every beast of the field; upon thy"},"913":{"dur":4,"text":"belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat\nall the days of thy life\". This is when God"},"918":{"dur":5,"text":"is judging the serpent after the serpent has\nbeguiled Eve and caused her to sin, who then"},"923":{"dur":5,"text":"in turn got Adam to sin. It says in verse\n15, \"and I will put enmity between thee and"},"928":{"dur":5,"text":"the woman.\" So who is He putting enmity between\nthere? Who is the \"thee\" in that verse? The"},"934":{"dur":3,"text":"serpent, right? Because He says \"I will put\nenmity between THEE and the woman. So He is"},"937":{"dur":4,"text":"saying \"I am going to put enmity between the\nserpent and the woman\u201d, \"and between thy"},"942":{"dur":5,"text":"seed and her seed.\" So he is putting enmity\nbetween the seed of the serpent, and the seed"},"948":{"dur":5,"text":"of the woman. And it says in verse 15 there,\n\"it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt"},"953":{"dur":6,"text":"bruise his heel.\" Now, we know there that\nin verse 15 the \"seed\" of the woman that's"},"960":{"dur":7,"text":"being referred to there that is going to bruise\nthe head of Satan is the Lord Jesus Christ,"},"967":{"dur":7,"text":"because Jesus Christ will be born of the woman.\nJesus Christ is God in the flesh, but, he"},"975":{"dur":4,"text":"was also born of a woman, he had a human mother.\nAnd that is what is being prophesied here"},"979":{"dur":5,"text":"in Genesis 3:15, that there will be enmity\nbetween Satan and the woman, AND between Satan's"},"985":{"dur":5,"text":"seed and the woman's seed, meaning the Lord\nJesus Christ. And then it says \"it shall bruise"},"991":{"dur":4,"text":"thy head\"- meaning the seed of the woman,\nor Jesus Christ shall bruise Satan's head..."},"995":{"dur":5,"text":"\"And thou shalt bruise his heel\", meaning\nthat Satan will bruise the heel of the Lord"},"1000":{"dur":5,"text":"Jesus Christ. Now, there's also a passage\nin the New Testament that says unto BELIEVERS"},"1006":{"dur":6,"text":"that Satan shall be bruised under their feet\nshortly. So just as Jesus Christ will rule"},"1012":{"dur":5,"text":"all nations with a rod of iron- but then it\nsays in Revelation chapter number 2 to the"},"1018":{"dur":5,"text":"church at Thyatira, he says that \"him that\novercometh and keepeth my works unto the end,"},"1024":{"dur":4,"text":"shall rule all nations with a rod of iron.\"\nSo the Lord Jesus Christ will rule, but we"},"1028":{"dur":4,"text":"will reign with him. The Lord Jesus Christ\nwill bruise the head of the serpent; we will"},"1033":{"dur":6,"text":"also bruise the head of the serpent, is what\nthe Bible teaches. So here we see an enmity"},"1040":{"dur":4,"text":"between the woman and the serpent. A struggle\nbetween the woman and the serpent, and between"},"1044":{"dur":4,"text":"the serpent's seed and her seed. And that\nstruggle, I believe, culminates in Revelation"},"1049":{"dur":7,"text":"12, where we see the serpent persecuting the\nwoman. Now, who are the \"seed\" of Satan? Well,"},"1056":{"dur":4,"text":"that's simple. All throughout the Bible, we\nhave people that are referred to as \"sons"},"1061":{"dur":5,"text":"of Belial\", or in the Bible, in the New Testament,\nwhere Jesus looked at the Pharisees and said"},"1066":{"dur":5,"text":"\"you are of your father the Devil\". The Bible\ntalks about those that are \"twice dead, without"},"1071":{"dur":4,"text":"fruit, plucked up by the root\", the Bible\ntalks about making people \"twofold more the"},"1075":{"dur":5,"text":"child of hell as yourself\". The Bible teaches\nthat people who are \"sons of the devil\", or"},"1081":{"dur":4,"text":"for example- the parable of the wheat and\nthe tares, remember the tares are the children"},"1085":{"dur":4,"text":"of the wicked one? All throughout the Old\nTestament, the \"sons of Belial\"... \"Belial\""},"1090":{"dur":7,"text":"is related to the word \"Baal\", \"Beelzebub\",\n\"Bell\", these are all the same person, so"},"1098":{"dur":5,"text":"these are the children of the wicked one,\nor what we would call \"reprobates\", okay."},"1104":{"dur":4,"text":"And so these reprobates are the children of\nSatan. There is enmity between them and the"},"1108":{"dur":4,"text":"Lord Jesus Christ. There is enmity between\nJesus Christ and the devil. There is enmity"},"1113":{"dur":6,"text":"between the woman, and the serpent. And what\nwe see in Revelation 12, the serpent persecuting"},"1119":{"dur":6,"text":"the woman, I believe that ties in perfectly\nwith Genesis chapter 3, where we see the enmity"},"1125":{"dur":3,"text":"between the serpent and the woman. You say\n\"well, what does that mean? Who is the woman?\""},"1129":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, if we were to put a name on the woman,\nit would not be the virgin Mary, and here's"},"1135":{"dur":6,"text":"why. Because when the devil goes to persecute\nthe woman, it's when he is cast out of heaven."},"1141":{"dur":7,"text":"Well, according to Daniel chapter 12, verse\n1, Satan being cast out of heaven- if we compare"},"1150":{"dur":5,"text":"Daniel 12:1 with Revelation 12- that is what\nstarts the tribulation period, when Satan"},"1155":{"dur":4,"text":"is cast out of heaven. Because it says that\n\"Michael will stand up, the great prince which"},"1160":{"dur":3,"text":"standeth for the children of thy people\" and\nhe says \"then shall be a time of trouble such"},"1163":{"dur":4,"text":"as was not...\" And that's what we see in chapter\n12.

So what does he do when she escapes?"},"2440":{"dur":6,"text":"It says in verse number 15, \"And the serpent\ncast out of his mouth water as a flood after"},"2446":{"dur":3,"text":"the woman, that he might cause her to be carried\naway of the flood.\" So what is the devil's"},"2450":{"dur":5,"text":"goal here in verse 15? He wants the woman\nto be drowned, so he sends a flood out of"},"2456":{"dur":7,"text":"his mouth that he might cause the woman to\nbe carried away of the flood. Now, is this"},"2463":{"dur":4,"text":"a literal flood? It's hard to say when you\nare looking at parables. Go back to Daniel"},"2468":{"dur":5,"text":"chapter 7 if you would. And you say, \"well,\nPastor Anderson, you've got this sermon completely"},"2473":{"dur":6,"text":"all wrong, because Revelation 12 is about\nthe second half of Daniel's 70th week.\" It"},"2480":{"dur":4,"text":"just doesn't make any sense my friend, because\nit's not until after he fails to defeat the"},"2484":{"dur":4,"text":"woman that he goes after the seed, and that's\nwhen the antichrist is put in power.

And THEN, at\nthe end of the war, desolations are determined"},"2609":{"dur":4,"text":"and then he goes into the abomination of desolation\nin verse 27. So, this is just a theory. I'm"},"2614":{"dur":6,"text":"just speculating here. But, I believe that\npossibly, the flood in Revelation 12 is referring"},"2620":{"dur":6,"text":"to a literal flood. Now, other interpretations\nhave been that when the Bible says that the"},"2627":{"dur":5,"text":"dragon casts out of his mouth water as a flood\nafter the woman, that's referring to armies,"},"2632":{"dur":6,"text":"just a \"flood\" of soldiers, or a flood of\ntroops. But wait a minute. He says \"water"},"2638":{"dur":5,"text":"as a flood after the woman\".

Then basically, this would go back"},"2659":{"dur":4,"text":"to what God said after he destroyed the earth\nfor the first time. You remember how he promised?"},"2664":{"dur":4,"text":"And he made a really big deal about it; he\nmade a big point to say \"I will never flood"},"2669":{"dur":3,"text":"the earth again\". Do you remember that?

I mean"},"2692":{"dur":4,"text":"look, is there any indication in the Bible,\nanywhere, that the devil loves us? Or that"},"2697":{"dur":5,"text":"the devil loves anybody?

All these powerful"},"2742":{"dur":6,"text":"people... What do they say that they want\nto do to the population of the world? They"},"2749":{"dur":6,"text":"openly call for reducing the population of\nthe world by 90%, don't they? Was it Prince"},"2755":{"dur":4,"text":"Philip, was he the one who said he wants to\ncome back, if he were reincarnated, he would"},"2759":{"dur":4,"text":"want to come back as a deadly virus that would\nwipe out 90% of the human race? Isn't that"},"2763":{"dur":6,"text":"a sweet thing to say? Isn't that loving? And\nBill Gates, I saw Bill Gates talking, and"},"2770":{"dur":6,"text":"he said \"all these different factors of global\nwarming and climate change and carbon pollution\","},"2776":{"dur":7,"text":"he said \"the number of people on the planet,\nhow much stuff they're using... one of these"},"2786":{"dur":5,"text":"numbers is going to have to go down, as close\nto zero as we can get it\", referring to human"},"2791":{"dur":7,"text":"population growth, how much machines we use,\nhow much carbon we're putting out. He said"},"2800":{"dur":7,"text":"\"let's start with population\". That's literally\nwhat he said. Everyone's seen it, it's out"},"2809":{"dur":6,"text":"there. And so he openly talks about wanting\npeople DEAD, because you can't reduce the"},"2815":{"dur":7,"text":"population by 90% just by handing out birth\ncontrol. You do it by KILLING 90% of the people"},"2823":{"dur":5,"text":"on the planet. And we know that these people\nare of Satan, they're antichrist, they're"},"2828":{"dur":6,"text":"pro-one world Government, they're pro-globalist,\nand these people want to basically annihilate"},"2835":{"dur":4,"text":"90% of the planet. And they make all kinds\nof movies about it in Hollywood too. There"},"2840":{"dur":3,"text":"are all kinds of movies that allude to this.\nNow, I just found out about this movie a couple"},"2844":{"dur":3,"text":"of months ago. I'd never seen it of course,\nbecause I quit watching Hollywood movies over"},"2847":{"dur":5,"text":"a decade ago. But, somebody told me about\nthis movie called 2012. And I'd never heard"},"2852":{"dur":7,"text":"of it, until the end of 2012. But I guess\nit had been out for years. So I went online"},"2859":{"dur":5,"text":"and I read a synopsis of the movie, and basically,\nwhat the movie talked about was basically,"},"2864":{"dur":6,"text":"the entire earth's population being wiped\nout by a flood. And everybody dies in this"},"2871":{"dur":5,"text":"flood, and then basically the government is\nthe saviour, because the government builds"},"2877":{"dur":6,"text":"these arks. They build these high tech \"arks\",\njust for certain people to survive. And guess"},"2883":{"dur":6,"text":"who survives? The billionaires, the politicians,\nthe elites, they get to survive in these arks"},"2890":{"dur":4,"text":"that they government build just for them.\nThey don't warn anybody; don't tell anyone"},"2894":{"dur":4,"text":"else on the earth. And if I'm getting it wrong,\nI'm sorry, I read the synopsis online. But"},"2899":{"dur":5,"text":"they're saying \"we're going to build these\narks just so that the most important people"},"2905":{"dur":5,"text":"can survive\" and basically, at the end of\nthis movie, 99% of the earth's population"},"2910":{"dur":5,"text":"is wiped out. But it's a really happy ending.\nEven though billions and billions of people"},"2916":{"dur":3,"text":"are dead, it's a really happy ending, because\nall the elites, and all the important people,"},"2919":{"dur":7,"text":"THEY get to survive! And that solves the environmental\nproblems, great! That's how these people are"},"2926":{"dur":5,"text":"thinking, and that's how they are programming\nyou. Because whenever Hollywood puts out a"},"2931":{"dur":3,"text":"movie that they spent hundreds of millions\nof dollars on, you better know that the devil"},"2935":{"dur":4,"text":"has an agenda that he is trying to get across\nin that movie. Because Hollywood promotes"},"2939":{"dur":5,"text":"all manner of wickedness through entertainment,\nthat's why we shouldn't watch their movies."},"2944":{"dur":6,"text":"And so what I'm saying is that it's very possible\nthat the devil in the midst of causing all"},"2950":{"dur":3,"text":"this world warfare, in the midst of causing\nall this famine- and look, this famine is"},"2954":{"dur":4,"text":"going to be so serious. We're not just talking\nabout \"oh, people are hungry.\" No. People"},"2959":{"dur":6,"text":"are going to be DYING en masse, of starvation.\nWe're talking MILLIONS dying. MILLIONS dying"},"2965":{"dur":5,"text":"in warfare, MILLIONS dying of famine. MILLIONS\ndying of disease. MILLIONS and millions of"},"2970":{"dur":6,"text":"people dying. And I think that during this\ntime, the devil may decide to try and flood"},"2977":{"dur":4,"text":"the entire earth and kill everyone using that\nmethod. It would tie in perfectly with what"},"2981":{"dur":5,"text":"we see in Revelation 12. And again, it's just\na theory. It's possible. The Bible doesn't"},"2986":{"dur":3,"text":"talk a lot about it, so it makes me wonder\nwhy didn't the Bible talk more about this?"},"2990":{"dur":3,"text":"Maybe because it's going to fail, so it's\nnot that big of an event to talk much about."},"2994":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's possible that during the first half\nof Daniel's 70th week, perhaps there will"},"2998":{"dur":5,"text":"be some kind of a flooding that takes place\nthat is an attempt, and it's not going to"},"3004":{"dur":5,"text":"work. Basically the water is going to be absorbed\ninto the earth, and it's not going to succeed."},"3009":{"dur":3,"text":"But it could be something that he could try,\nbecause God promised that it wouldn't happen."},"3013":{"dur":4,"text":"Maybe he is just trying to violate God's word\nby destroying the earth with a flood. Anyway,"},"3017":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm just throwing that out there as a possible\ntheory. But what we do know, is that the devil"},"3021":{"dur":7,"text":"will persecute mankind with a goal of killing\noff the population in the first half of Daniel's"},"3029":{"dur":3,"text":"70th week. And we already see them talking\nabout it. We already see them talking about"},"3032":{"dur":5,"text":"killing off the population. We see them not\nat war with Israel today. When we look at"},"3038":{"dur":5,"text":"the satanic rulers of the darkness of this\nworld today, do we really see them going after"},"3043":{"dur":3,"text":"Israel? If anything it seems like they are\npropping up Israel, doesn't it? Who are they"},"3047":{"dur":7,"text":"going after though? Mankind. I think at the\nend of the day, these people that are serving"},"3054":{"dur":6,"text":"Satan, they don't realise that Satan has no\nlove for them. He is just using them as his"},"3061":{"dur":6,"text":"pawns for his own agenda. And so let's just\nquickly finish up with everything else in"},"3067":{"dur":5,"text":"this chapter that we haven't covered. The\nBible talks about the fact that in verse 4,"},"3072":{"dur":3,"text":"\"the tail of the dragon drew the third part\nof the stars of heaven and did cast them to"},"3076":{"dur":5,"text":"the earth\". Often angels are referred to as\n\"stars\" in the Bible. This is referring to"},"3081":{"dur":5,"text":"the fact that one third of the angels followed\nSatan in his rebellion and became fallen angels,"},"3086":{"dur":5,"text":"or devils and demons. So, just a quick review\nof the passage. It started out with this woman"},"3091":{"dur":4,"text":"appearing in heaven. She is pregnant, she\nis in labour, there is a dragon there, which"},"3096":{"dur":4,"text":"represents Satan ready to devour the child\nas soon as it is born. She gives birth to"},"3100":{"dur":4,"text":"the child, who is to rule all nations with\na rod of iron. The child is caught up to God"},"3104":{"dur":4,"text":"and to His throne- the ascension of Jesus\nChrist. The dragon goes out to persecute the"},"3109":{"dur":6,"text":"woman which brought forth the man-child, right?\nBut, the woman flees into the wilderness,"},"3115":{"dur":4,"text":"and it says in verse 6, \"where she hath a\nplace prepared of God, that they should feed"},"3120":{"dur":3,"text":"her there a thousand two hundred and threescore\ndays. And there was war in heaven: Michael"},"3124":{"dur":3,"text":"and his angels fought against the dragon;\nand the dragon fought and his angels, And"},"3127":{"dur":3,"text":"prevailed not; neither was their place found\nany more in heaven. And the great dragon was"},"3131":{"dur":4,"text":"cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil,\nand Satan, which deceiveth the whole world:"},"3136":{"dur":3,"text":"he was cast out into the earth, and his angels\nwere cast out with him. And I heard a loud"},"3140":{"dur":4,"text":"voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation,\nand strength, and the kingdom of our God,"},"3144":{"dur":4,"text":"and the power of his Christ: for the accuser\nof our brethren is cast down, which accused"},"3148":{"dur":5,"text":"them before our God day and night. And they\novercame him by the blood of the Lamb, and"},"3153":{"dur":4,"text":"by the word of their testimony; and they loved\nnot their lives unto the death. Therefore"},"3158":{"dur":3,"text":"rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in\nthem. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and"},"3162":{"dur":4,"text":"of the sea! for the devil is come down unto\nyou, having great wrath, because he knoweth"},"3166":{"dur":4,"text":"that he hath but a short time. And when the\ndragon saw that he was cast unto the earth,"},"3170":{"dur":3,"text":"he persecuted the woman which brought forth\nthe man child. And to the woman were given"},"3174":{"dur":3,"text":"two wings of a great eagle, that she might\nfly into the wilderness, into her place, where"},"3178":{"dur":4,"text":"she is nourished for a time, and times, and\nhalf a time, from the face of the serpent."},"3182":{"dur":4,"text":"And the serpent cast out of his mouth water\nas a flood\" and so on and so forth. So what"},"3186":{"dur":6,"text":"we see here, is that the battle that takes\nplace in heaven, clearly takes place BEFORE"},"3193":{"dur":4,"text":"the persecution of the woman. Even though\nthis chapter skips around a little bit, because"},"3197":{"dur":3,"text":"he says \"when the dragon saw that he was cast\nunto the earth he persecuted the woman which"},"3201":{"dur":5,"text":"brought forth the manchild\". He tries that\n\"time, and times, and half a time\", 1260 days,"},"3206":{"dur":6,"text":"and THEN when that FAILS, it says \"the earth\nhelped the woman\", verse 16, \"and opened her"},"3213":{"dur":3,"text":"mouth and swallowed up the flood which the\ndragon cast out of his mouth\", verse 17, \"and"},"3217":{"dur":5,"text":"the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went\nto make war with the remnant of her seed,"},"3222":{"dur":4,"text":"which keep the commandments of God, and have\nthe testimony of Jesus Christ.\" So what we"},"3227":{"dur":5,"text":"see is the SAVED are now the target, in verse\n17. Now that he has gone after the woman,"},"3232":{"dur":4,"text":"he is ready to go after the saints. He is\nready to go after the remnant of her seed"},"3237":{"dur":4,"text":"which keep the commandments of God and have\nthe testimony of Jesus Christ. And in chapter"},"3241":{"dur":5,"text":"13, what do we see?
