Morgan?"},"320":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's do Morgan, just for fun."},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't know why."},"325":{"dur":1,"text":"So that was from\nMorgan Freeman's

the brain to make\noxytocin, this molecule that"},"342":{"dur":1,"text":"makes us care about others."},"344":{"dur":1,"text":"And we've shown,\nboth in field studies"},"346":{"dur":4,"text":"and in

really bad to you."},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's also a\nway we can play."},"369":{"dur":1,"text":"So we've done this\nlots of places."},"371":{"dur":3,"text":"This is a picture of me with\nmy \"tribe\" in Papua New Guinea."},"374":{"dur":1,"text":"So I did an experiment\nin the rain forests"},"376":{"dur":0,"text":"of Papua New Guinea."},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"If you guys know about\nPapua

primitive."},"390":{"dur":3,"text":"And even these guys in an\necologically valid setting"},"393":{"dur":3,"text":"induce oxytocin release\nwhen they engage in rituals."},"397":{"dur":1,"text":"So it seems to be\na human universal."},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"So as we began\nstudying this, we spent"},"400":{"dur":3,"text":"a lot of time\nunderstanding what inhibits"},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"the release of oxytocin,\nwhat promotes it,"},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"so we could really understand\nhow this brain system allows"},"408":{"dur":3,"text":"us to navigate through the sea\nof strangers in which we live."},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"And one of the places that\nwe live with other strangers"},"414":{"dur":1,"text":"is at work."},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"And so as we start\nthinking about how"},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"do we apply this to understand\nwhy some organizations reach"},"422":{"dur":3,"text":"high performance and others\ndon't perform very well at all."},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"Start thinking of a\nsimple model that we"},"428":{"dur":1,"text":"could use in neuroscience\nto understand that,"},"430":{"dur":1,"text":"which I call the POP model."},"432":{"dur":3,"text":"So POP stands for people,\norganization, and purpose."},"435":{"dur":1,"text":"So people is hiring."},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"So we could do a whole\nother day on hiring."},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"Not going to talk\nabout it today."},"441":{"dur":4,"text":"So in short, you know\nthe right thing to do,"},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"which is hire smart people\nfor the right cultural fit."},"449":{"dur":1,"text":"What we do want to talk\nabout is organization."},"451":{"dur":1,"text":"So I can take great\npeople, put them"},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"in a really crappy\nculture, and they're not"},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"going to perform well."},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"Or I can have a great culture\nand hire the wrong people."},"459":{"dur":1,"text":"They're not going\nto perform well."},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is really going\nto focus on-- this talk--"},"463":{"dur":1,"text":"on organization and on purpose."},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'll come back to\npurpose at the end."},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"So I want to push on to\ntwo of those three levers"},"470":{"dur":3,"text":"today, see what\nwe get out of it."},"473":{"dur":3,"text":"So here's the model we've\ncome from, from the dozen"},"476":{"dur":1,"text":"years of studies."},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"And I should say, these\nstudies include field studies"},"480":{"dur":0,"text":"at for profits."},"481":{"dur":3,"text":"So come in, take blood, measure\nneurologic activity a variety"},"485":{"dur":1,"text":"of ways from people at work."},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"And so not only does this\nwork in the laboratory,"},"488":{"dur":1,"text":"it works in the field."},"489":{"dur":6,"text":"So we identified eight\nclasses of policies"},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"that you can push on in\nyour organization that"},"499":{"dur":1,"text":"can raise trust."},"500":{"dur":3,"text":"Somehow, magically, those\neight class of policies"},"504":{"dur":4,"text":"have an easy to remember\nacronym, oxytocin."},"508":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't know how that worked."},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"So if I push on these oxytocin\nfactors, one or more of them,"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going to get more trust."},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"The science predicts that\nwhen I have trust combined"},"516":{"dur":1,"text":"with a sense of\npurpose, what I call"},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"transcendent purpose-- I'll talk\nabout that in a minute-- then"},"521":{"dur":4,"text":"I get more engagement at work\nfrom these volunteer employees,"},"525":{"dur":1,"text":"greater customer service."},"527":{"dur":4,"text":"And an outcome of that\nis that I just dig it."},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"It's fun now."},"533":{"dur":1,"text":"There's still some\ndrag parts of work,"},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"but by and large,\nI love what we do."},"537":{"dur":1,"text":"I love the people I work with."},"539":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'm just knocking it out\nof the park all the time."},"543":{"dur":1,"text":"So when I have high\nperformance, then I"},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"generate this feedback\nloop, which is,"},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"now it's more fun come to work\nbecause we're knocking it out"},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"of the park a lot of the days."},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe not every day,\nbut a lot of times."},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"Man, we had home run yesterday."},"556":{"dur":0,"text":"That was awesome."},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"So how do I create that\nenvironment in which,"},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"again, even if I didn't pay\nyou, you still want to show up."},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm going to go through\neach of those oxytocin"},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"factors in some detail."},"568":{"dur":1,"text":"Not too much detail,\nbecause I have an hour."},"570":{"dur":1,"text":"Give you an example\nof a company that's"},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"been doing this very well."},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"And at the end,\ntalk about how that"},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"relates to outcome\nmeasures based"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"on a sample of about\n5,000 employees"},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"from companies around the globe."},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"So here are the eight factors."},"586":{"dur":4,"text":"So once you have those factors,\nhow do you manage that?"},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"Second confession of the talk."},"598":{"dur":3,"text":"As you guys know from that\nnice video from Morgan Freeman,"},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"I am a brilliant scientist."},"604":{"dur":1,"text":"I think of everything to study."},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't know what I'm doing\nhalf the time, like you guys."},"608":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm just trying to\nfigure it out as I go."},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"So I actually had an\norganization come to me"},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"some years ago and\nsay, hey, we think"},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"trust is really important."},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"Could you help us understand\ntrust in our organization?"},"619":{"dur":1,"text":"And I said, oh, yeah."},"620":{"dur":0,"text":"I'll be happy to come."},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll bring my needles and\nmy centrifuges and dry ice."},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"They're like, oh, no."},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"They said, is there some\nof the way you can do that?"},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"I start thinking, oh, yeah."},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"We know a lot about\nthis brain system"},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"that allows us to trust\nother people quite rapidly."},"634":{"dur":1,"text":"Oxytocin release happens\nin a second or two"},"636":{"dur":3,"text":"after you interact with somebody\nif it's a positive interaction."},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"So we know a lot\nabout that system."},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"How do we turn that\ndown into a tool?"},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"So we developed the\nsurvey we O Factor"},"646":{"dur":3,"text":"which allows us\nto quantify trust"},"650":{"dur":3,"text":"with an organization and\nthese eight classes of factors"},"653":{"dur":1,"text":"that produce it."},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"That tool also allows us\nto measure things like joy"},"657":{"dur":0,"text":"at work."},"658":{"dur":3,"text":"So we're going to use that\ntool to then seek to measure"},"662":{"dur":1,"text":"what we want to manage."},"664":{"dur":1,"text":"That makes sense?"},"665":{"dur":1,"text":"So let me go through\nthese again, briefly."},"667":{"dur":3,"text":"And we'll have plenty of\ntime for questions too."},"670":{"dur":3,"text":"So the first is ovation."},"673":{"dur":1,"text":"This meaning\nrecognizing excellence."},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"Someone in the room's\ngoing to think, gosh,"},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"day one in business\nschool at Stanford"},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"and we talked about\nrecognizing people."},"685":{"dur":0,"text":"That's not new."},"686":{"dur":1,"text":"Here's where the\nneuroscience comes in."},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"Neuroscience has very\nspecific predictions"},"690":{"dur":3,"text":"on how to get the most\nout of recognition."},"694":{"dur":3,"text":"In particular, recognition\nthat is personal."},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"That is tangible."},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"That happens close in time when\nthe goal is met or exceeded,"},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"and no more than a\nweek after happens."},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"That's unexpected."},"708":{"dur":1,"text":"So you guys don't have this."},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"But these businesses that have\nemployee of the month parking"},"712":{"dur":0,"text":"place."},"715":{"dur":0,"text":"OK, I guess."},"716":{"dur":1,"text":"But basically everyone\ngets it, right?"},"717":{"dur":1,"text":"Move it around."},"719":{"dur":3,"text":"But instead, for Eric\nwho I know loves coffee,"},"722":{"dur":1,"text":"his team just\nnailed this project."},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"They were working for\nthree months, killed it."},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"And then we come into our\nall hands meeting on Monday"},"729":{"dur":3,"text":"and I bring him a great gift\nbasket of really great coffee"},"732":{"dur":1,"text":"and a nice mug."},"734":{"dur":1,"text":"Because I know him, right?"},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'm invested in him."},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"So what happens during\novations is that not only do we"},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"recognize the team\nfor doing well,"},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"you have an opportunity\nfor a debrief."},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"So Eric, you guys\njust killed it."},"748":{"dur":1,"text":"Tell us about the project."},"749":{"dur":0,"text":"What happened?"},"750":{"dur":0,"text":"What went wrong?"},"751":{"dur":0,"text":"Say, oh, you know what?"},"752":{"dur":1,"text":"We were working on this and we\nthought we're going to do this,"},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"but then we found out\nthat stuff didn't work."},"756":{"dur":1,"text":"So then we pivoted\nand we did this."},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"And then three days\nbefore it was done,"},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"the servers crashed and then\nwe had to find the backups"},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"and then Tori worked super late\nand she worked til midnight"},"765":{"dur":1,"text":"and she saved all\nthe data and then"},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"we got the project done on time."},"769":{"dur":2,"text":"So we just got a\nchance to do a debrief."},"772":{"dur":1,"text":"Not only on what\ngoes right, but what"},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"happens when things go wrong."},"776":{"dur":3,"text":"So ovation is both recognizing\nthe individual and the team,"},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"but also identifying\nwhat do we do?"},"782":{"dur":1,"text":"What's best practice?"},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's discover best practice."},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"It also creates aspirations."},"788":{"dur":4,"text":"So Barbara's team would\nlike to be recognized."},"792":{"dur":3,"text":"So when her project\ncomes up, yeah."},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"Saying, oh yeah,\nthat's pretty cool."},"797":{"dur":3,"text":"Everyone clapping for Eric's\nteam and it was great."},"801":{"dur":1,"text":"So you're building\nup this culture"},"803":{"dur":2,"text":"that says we recognize you."},"805":{"dur":2,"text":"We recognize that you\nare working very hard."},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"We recognize you're putting\nyour heart and soul into this,"},"810":{"dur":2,"text":"and we want to recognize\nthat it's valuable."},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"We recognize it as a\ngroup that it's valuable."},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"And we want to use\nthe implications"},"817":{"dur":3,"text":"of the neuroscience\nto get the biggest"},"821":{"dur":3,"text":"neurologic impact and therefore\nthe biggest behavioral impact."},"824":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's lots behind this\nI'm not going to talk about,"},"827":{"dur":3,"text":"but this sets up pathways in\nthe brain that essentially"},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"make you crave that."},"831":{"dur":1,"text":"I want to be recognized."},"833":{"dur":0,"text":"I'm working hard."},"834":{"dur":1,"text":"Even the introverts, like me."},"835":{"dur":1,"text":"We want to be\nrecognized occasionally."},"837":{"dur":2,"text":"So yeah, you were great."},"839":{"dur":0,"text":"That's awesome."},"842":{"dur":2,"text":"Number two is expectation."},"844":{"dur":1,"text":"This is designing\nchallenges at work."},"846":{"dur":1,"text":"You guys know a lot about this."},"848":{"dur":1,"text":"Oh, by the way, I'm\nputting the data up."},"849":{"dur":4,"text":"So the values here are how\nmuch of each of these factors--"},"854":{"dur":2,"text":"how much they explain\norganizational trust."},"856":{"dur":1,"text":"All those factors\nare not independent."},"858":{"dur":1,"text":"There's some overlap."},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"So they sum to more than\none because of that."},"862":{"dur":4,"text":"So expectation explains 70%\nof organizational trust."},"866":{"dur":3,"text":"So again, from the science,\nif I want to create challenges"},"870":{"dur":4,"text":"at work, those challenges have\nto enable what psychologists"},"875":{"dur":1,"text":"call challenge stress."},"876":{"dur":1,"text":"I want to put you\nin a situation where"},"878":{"dur":1,"text":"you know what you need to do."},"880":{"dur":2,"text":"You know when it's\ngoing to be over."},"882":{"dur":1,"text":"You have very clear goals."},"883":{"dur":1,"text":"The outcomes are concrete."},"885":{"dur":2,"text":"What I don't what\nto do is move you"},"887":{"dur":2,"text":"into a chronic stress state."},"890":{"dur":2,"text":"So chronic stress,\nwe know, inhibits"},"892":{"dur":1,"text":"the release of

psychopaths"},"2691":{"dur":3,"text":"or maybe suffer from\nforms of autism or--"},"2694":{"dur":1,"text":"PAUL ZAK: Great question."},"2695":{"dur":3,"text":"And so the back story on\nthis, what started out"},"2698":{"dur":2,"text":"as basic science research did\nspawn a lot of clinical trials"},"2701":{"dur":3,"text":"for things like autism,\nschizophrenia, social anxiety,"},"2704":{"dur":1,"text":"depression."},"2706":{"dur":3,"text":"We've work with\npsychopaths in prisons."},"2709":{"dur":4,"text":"So oxytocin, like many\nother chemicals in the body,"},"2714":{"dur":1,"text":"is re-used."},"2716":{"dur":2,"text":"So it functions\noutside the brain"},"2718":{"dur":3,"text":"to facilitate uterine\ncontractions during

responses."},"2728":{"dur":5,"text":"And so the secret on why it\nreally hadn't been studied"},"2734":{"dur":2,"text":"outside of reproduction is\nno one figured out a way"},"2736":{"dur":2,"text":"to actually measure that acute\nbrain response, and we did."},"2739":{"dur":1,"text":"And once we had this tool,\nthen you can go to town"},"2741":{"dur":1,"text":"and ask a lot of\nquestions with that tool."},"2742":{"dur":1,"text":"And this was based\non animal research."},"2744":{"dur":2,"text":"So I took the animal research,\nturned it into human research,"},"2747":{"dur":1,"text":"which is not always trivial."},"2748":{"dur":2,"text":"But once we had that, it worked."},"2750":{"dur":3,"text":"So what we found is that\neverybody makes oxytocin,"},"2754":{"dur":2,"text":"they just don't always\nmake it at the right times."},"2756":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you're having a really\nbad day, high levels of stress,"},"2760":{"dur":1,"text":"you inhibit oxytocin release."},"2762":{"dur":1,"text":"If you had a very\nadverse childhood,"},"2764":{"dur":3,"text":"abuse neglect history,\nthen the brain regions that"},"2767":{"dur":3,"text":"should have many

oxytocin."},"2785":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's not the chronic level."},"2786":{"dur":1,"text":"It's this acute response."},"2788":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's the trick."},"2789":{"dur":2,"text":"They don't get the acute\nresponse in the right away."},"2792":{"dur":2,"text":"And, in fact, they\nmake lots of oxytocin"},"2794":{"dur":2,"text":"because their receptors\nare dysfunctional."},"2796":{"dur":2,"text":"And what do they lack primarily?"},"2798":{"dur":1,"text":"Psychopaths lack empathy."},"2800":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's exactly what\noxytocin increases most."},"2802":{"dur":5,"text":"So oxytocin is an\ninnate moral compass."},"2808":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm getting feedback when I\ninteract with the humans based"},"2811":{"dur":3,"text":"on their body
