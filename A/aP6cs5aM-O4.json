issue"},"844":{"dur":2,"text":"they were raising around the\ngovernance and leadership of the"},"846":{"dur":2,"text":"organisation than about quality\nand safety, although there was an"},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"encroachment into quality and safety."},"852":{"dur":6,"text":"So I contacted David Bennett and wrote\nto him setting out some of the concerns,"},"859":{"dur":3,"text":"but this is happening on a number\nof occasions, Mike do you want to add?"},"863":{"dur":3,"text":">> Just very briefly to add to that, yes\nI think we have contact at a number of"},"867":{"dur":5,"text":"different levels, between the acute policy\nteam for example and their opposite"},"873":{"dur":5,"text":"numbers at Monitor, and I have links\nand regular discussions with Monitor,"},"879":{"dur":3,"text":"either about individual Trusts and\ncertainly if we heard a new concern and"},"882":{"dur":4,"text":"if it was a Foundation Trust and if it\nwas either about their finance or their"},"887":{"dur":4,"text":"leadership, then we would\nundoubtedly work with them."},"891":{"dur":4,"text":">> And are we clear\nthat our interfaces are robust?"},"895":{"dur":4,"text":"So if somebody comes to say the\nnational contact centre, are we sure that"},"900":{"dur":2,"text":"that would get\nthrough to the right people?"},"902":{"dur":3,"text":"They're not going to say oh well that's\nMonitor's job, you need to contact them,"},"906":{"dur":2,"text":"that we actually do get\n-- you see what I mean?"},"909":{"dur":4,"text":">> My belief is the national contact\ncentre will firstly escalate it in my"},"913":{"dur":2,"text":"direction and then\nwe will decide from there."},"920":{"dur":10,"text":">> I think this is work in progress,\nso I'm clear that at Mike and -- at Mike's"},"930":{"dur":7,"text":"level, at my level if they come in we\nhave those

be behind your question,"},"945":{"dur":4,"text":"is that it doesn't have to come up to be\nexchanged, it's exchanged as a matter\nof routine."},"949":{"dur":3,"text":"I think we are in this stage,\nI suspect this is what's behind this"},"953":{"dur":4,"text":"recommendation from the Select\nCommittee, about how we take this to"},"957":{"dur":4,"text":"scale, rather than we actually rely on\npersonal relationships between senior"},"962":{"dur":5,"text":"people, and I think at the minute\nour performance on this will be variable,"},"968":{"dur":4,"text":"so I think locally this will be being done,\nbecause people will see it and they'll do"},"972":{"dur":1,"text":"it and just get on and do it."},"974":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think there are other cases where\nit probably does need to come up for the"},"977":{"dur":1,"text":"connections to be made."},"979":{"dur":3,"text":"But our ambition should be, actually\nthis is just the way we do business and I"},"983":{"dur":2,"text":"think we're getting closer to that."},"985":{"dur":3,"text":"But your question\nI think was can we be sure?"},"988":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think the answer is, we constantly\nneed to be vigilant that we're getting this"},"992":{"dur":2,"text":"into the right place and\nwe have more work to do."},"997":{"dur":3,"text":">> Just on this, it seems to me what\nthe Select Committee is asking or telling"},"1000":{"dur":4,"text":"us to do is a really neat way forward,\nbecause actually we've got to meet with"},"1005":{"dur":2,"text":"the people that complain\nto the Select Committee."},"1007":{"dur":3,"text":"So I presume this is the Foundation\nTrust Network and people like that,"},"1010":{"dur":3,"text":"because actually they'll be talking about\nour people on the ground, rather than"},"1014":{"dur":6,"text":"you, and they'll be talking about Monitor\npeople on the ground, and so that,"},"1020":{"dur":5,"text":"it seems to me meeting us, both\nmeeting those

happening."},"1040":{"dur":4,"text":">> So we are in a process of\ntaking that forward, as I say I had a long"},"1044":{"dur":5,"text":"conversation with David about doing\nthis and I have to say it was a very easy"},"1050":{"dur":3,"text":"conversation to have, so I think\nwe're in a good place in relation to this."},"1055":{"dur":3,"text":"9 and 10, Michael I don't intend to\npresent, it's an
