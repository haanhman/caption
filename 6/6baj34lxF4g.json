really payed attention to..."},"390":{"dur":5,"text":"But I think it was kind of, for me, at the\nforefront of my process at the time"},"396":{"dur":3,"text":"because it was, y'know,\nit had heavy

that you can have\nideas about your music,"},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"and you can have\nsomething that's visceral,"},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"and immediately impactful as well."},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"For me, that's kind of like the Holy Grail."},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"So I started asking some questions."},"612":{"dur":3,"text":"How can the concept of a work inform\nthe production of a piece"},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"to the extent that it's actually audible?"},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"So that one kind of main question,"},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"this is a question that sound artists\nare grappling with all the time..."},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"it's not necessarily new or unique to me."},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"And how can we take ideas from

today,"},"635":{"dur":2,"text":"situated where we are in 2015?"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that doesn't mean that all music\nhas to be conceptual to be good..."},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"It doesn't mean that all music\nhas to be made on a laptop."},"645":{"dur":3,"text":"But that's just how I'm able to approach\nmusic and can kind of..."},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"find purpose and find a meaning\nto drive it forward."},"653":{"dur":4,"text":"So, in terms of\napproaching these questions,"},"657":{"dur":6,"text":"like, one really clear, low-hanging fruit\nis obviously text and lyrics."},"664":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I wanted to kind of...\nyes, that's great..."},"668":{"dur":3,"text":"but I also wanted to figure out how\nthe production itself,"},"672":{"dur":3,"text":"the production techniques themselves,\ncould actually..."},"675":{"dur":3,"text":"be embodied with these ideas\nthat I was kind of working through."},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"How that could actually be audible\nin the production and the performance."},"685":{"dur":4,"text":"So, the next piece that I was working on\nwas Chorus."},"690":{"dur":4,"text":"and it was kind of inspired by this...\nThis is a screenshot of my laptop"},"695":{"dur":4,"text":"that I made for this.\nThis isn't a candid one, I staged this."},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"But, this is familiar to everyone,\nlike a million pages

world."},"718":{"dur":5,"text":"And so, my partner Mat Dryhurst\nwas working on some software"},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"and a process called \"Net Concr\u00e8te\","},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"that he made\nsome pieces with and presented"},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"several years ago at the Guggenheim."},"731":{"dur":4,"text":"And the idea behind the Net Concr\u00e8te\nsystem is that it kind of uses

new pallet."},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"And so where as Musique concr\u00e8te for\nmany of the pioneers"},"767":{"dur":4,"text":"was about kind of abstracting the sound\nfrom the meaning, from the origins..."},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"this was more about kind of\nbringing that back together,"},"775":{"dur":1,"text":"and actually acknowledging the meaning"},"777":{"dur":3,"text":"and acknowledging where those samples\nwhere coming from..."},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"and the familiarity of those sounds."},"784":{"dur":4,"text":"I also treated the vocal production\nin kind of a weird way."},"788":{"dur":4,"text":"I don't know if you've heard the track,\nI'll play a couple of clips..."},"793":{"dur":4,"text":"but I kind of like, chop off the attack\nand decay, so it's this like \"stuttered\"..."},"798":{"dur":4,"text":"to kind of emulate like a Skype\nconversation or y'know,"},"802":{"dur":4,"text":"like a non-seamless stream of audio\nthat you're receiving online."},"808":{"dur":2,"text":"I then I decided to marry that\nwith the kick-drum"},"810":{"dur":4,"text":"which is also\nnot the \"usual\" production technique:"},"815":{"dur":1,"text":"usually you'd wanna kind of like..."},"817":{"dur":3,"text":"snakily weave the vocal and the kick\nthroughout each other,"},"821":{"dur":3,"text":"but instead I wanted it to be this kind of\n'kick' and like, smack in the face"},"825":{"dur":3,"text":"with the voice with this kind of like\n'chopped off' voice for impact."},"829":{"dur":2,"text":"Then I also used every kind of voice\nI could get my hands on:"},"832":{"dur":4,"text":"vocals, tons of different processes of my\nown voice, vocal samples"},"837":{"dur":3,"text":"to create this kind of like \"digital choir\"..."},"842":{"dur":3,"text":"as kind of like the backing vocalists."},"846":{"dur":2,"text":"And what I was really trying to do\nis capture the sound of the internet"},"849":{"dur":3,"text":"that, yes, does involve kitsch\nand yes, does involve jingles"},"852":{"dur":4,"text":"but also is like a really terrifying place\nand a really emotional place."},"857":{"dur":2,"text":"So I wanted to kind of - not flatten -\nan internet aesthetic..."},"860":{"dur":2,"text":"into something that's just kitsch."},"864":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's see if I can play the right..."},"869":{"dur":1,"text":"I didn't wanna play..."},"881":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm gonna turn the volume\noff for a second..."},"882":{"dur":3,"text":"because some of these early clips..."},"886":{"dur":2,"text":"there's me laying\non the floor

room and he was..."},"905":{"dur":1,"text":"video-capturing the whole thing."},"906":{"dur":4,"text":"So there was a lot of this kind of\npersonal, intimate stuff added in as

been\na strong suit of mine..."},"1061":{"dur":3,"text":"so I was like, OK, I'm gonna try to write\nlike a \"songy song\" with lyrics"},"1064":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'm gonna try to marry that\nwith production techniques"},"1067":{"dur":3,"text":"and see if I can have it all kind of live\nin the same world together."},"1072":{"dur":2,"text":"So... the way that\npiece kinda started is, I was..."},"1075":{"dur":2,"text":"teaching during the week and then I was\ntouring on the weekends..."},"1078":{"dur":3,"text":"and at that time I didn't have\ninternational roaming on my
