forth."},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"And when Tony eventually\ndecided that he wanted to look"},"395":{"dur":6,"text":"into oral histories, we worked\ntogether to see which

100,000 photographs"},"478":{"dur":3,"text":"and 10,000 or more interviews."},"481":{"dur":3,"text":"So for all these scholars when they\ncome to research they need help"},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"to

happen,"},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"but it will be a long time\nbecause those of you who have been"},"509":{"dur":4,"text":"to the museum to the permanent\nexhibit, everything that's there is"},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"about five percent of\nwhat the museum has."},"517":{"dur":6,"text":"The rest, the 95 percent is\nkept in a state of the art area"},"523":{"dur":3,"text":"where temperature, pressure\nand humidity are very,"},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"very carefully controlled."},"528":{"dur":5,"text":"And we are building a new\nstructure just for that."},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"So my interaction with these two\nauthors has been very interesting."},"538":{"dur":3,"text":"And to see how the process evolved"},"541":{"dur":3,"text":"so that there is a book\nis always amazing to me."},"545":{"dur":4,"text":"Because sometimes it's an idea in\nsomeone's mind, and it takes five"},"549":{"dur":3,"text":"or sometimes even ten\nyears to see the product"},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"and be able to actually read it."},"555":{"dur":5,"text":"I think that both Nancy and Tony\nhad in mind the words of Elie Wiesel"},"561":{"dur":5,"text":"who warned that only those who were\nthere can write about the Holocaust."},"566":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's why I think they went\nto the horse's mouth, so to speak,"},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"to those survivors\nwho were interviewed"},"574":{"dur":3,"text":"or the survivor was alive."},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think they're\nalso trying to make sure"},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"that these memories are\nthere for us to remember."},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"Because Elie Wiesel also said"},"586":{"dur":4,"text":"that if we forget we'll cause\nthem to have a second death."},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"And unfortunately that is true."},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"The only thing that we\nhave really from those"},"596":{"dur":5,"text":"who were there are the memoirs and\noral histories of those who survive."},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"So they used raw testimonies,"},"605":{"dur":4,"text":"and for Our Crime Was\nBeing Jewish Tony combed"},"610":{"dur":5,"text":"through the museum's oral history\ninterviews and listened to,"},"615":{"dur":4,"text":"as you heard, 358 of them\nand pulled out of them some"},"620":{"dur":6,"text":"of the most powerful and\npoignant testimonies."},"626":{"dur":5,"text":"Symbolically that book is like\nthe chaos of the Holocaust."},"631":{"dur":1,"text":"There's no arrangement."},"633":{"dur":5,"text":"It's not arranged by geographical\nplace or in any other way,"},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"not chronologically or by subject."},"642":{"dur":3,"text":"And there's no index because\nI think the author felt"},"646":{"dur":4,"text":"that if he indexed the\n358 names one would think"},"651":{"dur":1,"text":"that these were all of them."},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"But all the others,\nespecially the victims,"},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"would not have been on the list."},"657":{"dur":5,"text":"And those evil acts that were\nperpetrated by the Nazis are"},"662":{"dur":4,"text":"so coldly described in the\npassages that Tony pulled"},"667":{"dur":4,"text":"out that one is left holding\nyour breath in disbelief."},"672":{"dur":3,"text":"I think this book will be a very\nuseful resource for teachers"},"676":{"dur":3,"text":"of all age because the\ninformation is right there."},"680":{"dur":1,"text":"And they will not have to comb"},"681":{"dur":3,"text":"through all these interviews\nas Tony had to."},"685":{"dur":5,"text":"And it is really excellent\ndocumentation of those crimes."},"691":{"dur":4,"text":"Nancy Geise, on the other\nhand, focused on one person."},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"And she interviewed him masterfully."},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"He was very reluctant at first."},"700":{"dur":4,"text":"Actually, you will hear from\nNancy, did not want to talk."},"705":{"dur":3,"text":"I think it just was too\npainful for him to remember."},"708":{"dur":6,"text":"But after several years\npossibly because of his guilt"},"715":{"dur":4,"text":"that he was the only one that\nsurvived he felt that he needed"},"719":{"dur":5,"text":"to talk to be the one who would\nrecord what happened to his family,"},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"too, everyone in his family."},"727":{"dur":4,"text":"His fortune was that he was a\nvery positive thinking person."},"731":{"dur":4,"text":"Because even in the total\ndarkness of the war he was able"},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"to see some rays of light."},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"And he was able to make a new and\nwonderful life in the United

describe"},"757":{"dur":4,"text":"by Auschwitz prisoner #34201."},"761":{"dur":4,"text":"And she included maps, documents,\nphotographs and a time line"},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"so that one could read

reviews of both books\nhave been excellent,"},"776":{"dur":1,"text":"and you might hear more about that."},"778":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think we're really very\nfortunate to have Anthony

you"},"794":{"dur":4,"text":"so that we will hear how this\nprocess of writing went on."},"798":{"dur":10,"text":"My first question is what led\nyou to decide after all the books"},"808":{"dur":5,"text":"that you wrote that you needed to\nwrite a book about the Holocaust?"},"813":{"dur":1,"text":">> Anthony Pitch: Good question."},"815":{"dur":3,"text":"Look, I must at the\nbeginning apologize."},"818":{"dur":5,"text":"I had a stroke, and my short-term\nmemory is not what it used to be."},"824":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, I recently forgot\nwhat I was talking about."},"828":{"dur":3,"text":"I hope it doesn't happen today."},"831":{"dur":2,"text":"Why did I choose the Holocaust?"},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"I had always been attracted\nby subjects"},"837":{"dur":3,"text":"that were epic, true and sad."},"840":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't know why, but\nthat's a fact of life."},"844":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's why I wrote about\nVietnam, [inaudible] held prisoner,"},"848":{"dur":4,"text":"the burning of the White House\nand the capital by the British,"},"853":{"dur":1,"text":"the Lincoln assassination."},"854":{"dur":2,"text":"They all fit that mold."},"856":{"dur":6,"text":"And then I thought, well, the\nHolocaust is in that mold also."},"863":{"dur":4,"text":"And probably it was my daughter\nsaid to me don't touch it."},"867":{"dur":3,"text":"It's been overdone, it's\nbeen written by everybody."},"871":{"dur":1,"text":"There's nothing new you can say."},"872":{"dur":4,"text":"And I accepted that,\nand I put it aside."},"876":{"dur":3,"text":"And then one day I was\nlooking at at YouTube,"},"880":{"dur":4,"text":"and I saw Dieudonne M'bala M'bala."},"884":{"dur":3,"text":"He is a Frenchman whose\nfather was Cameroonian"},"888":{"dur":1,"text":"and his mother was French."},"889":{"dur":1,"text":"He lives in France."},"891":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is the ranking anti-semite"},"894":{"dur":3,"text":"in

followers"},"917":{"dur":1,"text":"like nobody's business."},"919":{"dur":4,"text":"It so infuriated me that\nI had to reply to him."},"924":{"dur":3,"text":"And the best method I could do was"},"927":{"dur":3,"text":"by getting the Holocaust\nsurvivors themselves"},"931":{"dur":3,"text":"to tell him what they went\nthrough, what they endured."},"934":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's why I chose this book."},"938":{"dur":2,"text":"And I wrote the preface, that's all."},"940":{"dur":2,"text":"I let them speak for themselves."},"943":{"dur":5,"text":"I excerpted brief amounts that\nthey could describe the range"},"948":{"dur":1,"text":"of atrocities."},"950":{"dur":5,"text":"And it's one of those things that\nall Holocaust survivors have,"},"955":{"dur":5,"text":"the urge to record it for\na world naive to believe"},"961":{"dur":2,"text":"that it appears again and again."},"963":{"dur":2,"text":"And these are their\nstatements, not mine."},"965":{"dur":2,"text":"It's their wisdom."},"968":{"dur":3,"text":">> Michlean Amir: So\nmy next question is,"},"971":{"dur":2,"text":"although you partially answered it,"},"974":{"dur":4,"text":"but how was writing this book\ndifferent from writing about Lincoln"},"978":{"dur":2,"text":"or about the White House?"},"980":{"dur":2,"text":"Writing it how was that different?"},"982":{"dur":2,"text":">> Anthony Pitch: It's\ndifferent in this respect."},"985":{"dur":4,"text":"I had to insert myself\ninto my other books."},"990":{"dur":3,"text":"And I did research from\nHarvard right down to Alabama."},"993":{"dur":1,"text":"Any document I could get hold of."},"995":{"dur":3,"text":"There are state historical\nsocieties all over the place."},"998":{"dur":2,"text":"There's no end to the research."},"1001":{"dur":4,"text":"This one was quite easy for me"},"1005":{"dur":3,"text":"because I let the people\nspeak for themselves."},"1008":{"dur":5,"text":"My only insertion of\nmyself was to edit"},"1013":{"dur":5,"text":"because English was not the mother\ntongue of many of these people."},"1018":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, I probably\nwent through much more"},"1022":{"dur":2,"text":"than 1,000 of these interviews."},"1024":{"dur":6,"text":"And some of them the English was not\nquite good enough even for editing."},"1031":{"dur":6,"text":"And so I chose those who would\nshow the range of atrocities."},"1037":{"dur":3,"text":"And it was rather like\nbeing at an operation."},"1041":{"dur":4,"text":"I can stand blood, the slight\nof it, I can watch these things"},"1045":{"dur":2,"text":"on TV, it doesn't matter."},"1047":{"dur":3,"text":"Many people have said to\nme how did you manage it?"},"1050":{"dur":1,"text":"It's so frightening."},"1051":{"dur":3,"text":"But you can't write about the\nHolocaust unless you describe how"},"1055":{"dur":2,"text":"it was."},"1059":{"dur":3,"text":">> Michlean Amir: So that leads\nme to the next question which,"},"1062":{"dur":2,"text":"again, you partially answered."},"1064":{"dur":5,"text":"Was it emotionally difficult for you\nto deal with these interviews day in"},"1070":{"dur":5,"text":"and day out, during the night when\nyou were reading them so thoroughly?"},"1076":{"dur":4,"text":"Did it leave an effect on you the\nnext day or for a long

around."},"1098":{"dur":2,"text":"It was all scrubbed and clean."},"1100":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's the effect\nthat this had on me."},"1103":{"dur":3,"text":"Many people express surprise."},"1106":{"dur":2,"text":"They said how did you\nget through it?"},"1109":{"dur":3,"text":"And I don't know, but\nthat's an individual thing."},"1112":{"dur":4,"text":"It really didn't affect me, but know"},"1116":{"dur":6,"text":"that if you read this book\nyou probably may not be able"},"1123":{"dur":1,"text":"to finish it."},"1125":{"dur":7,"text":"It's so horrific, and this is

a really strange\nthing happened."},"1639":{"dur":3,"text":"So we went from that\ndetail, and he said,"},"1642":{"dur":3,"text":"and then they took me to Auschwitz."},"1645":{"dur":1,"text":"And while

of\nthe miracles of this story."},"1721":{"dur":3,"text":"Joe was so incredibly worried about\nhis family learning about this."},"1725":{"dur":3,"text":"His grandkids, they're adults\nnow, but one of them said"},"1728":{"dur":4,"text":"to him afterwards, grandpa,\nI've never loved you more."},"1732":{"dur":3,"text":"And that was one of the greatest\nblessings anyone could

Holocaust\nMuseum, April 30, 1942."},"1752":{"dur":4,"text":"He was at Auschwitz over two\nyears proper before being taken"},"1757":{"dur":3,"text":"to several other camps:\nBuchenwald, Ohrdruf and, finally,"},"1760":{"dur":3,"text":"right before the end of\nthe war Theresienstadt."},"1764":{"dur":2,"text":"Just before the end of the war Joe"},"1767":{"dur":3,"text":"and as the Soviet Army was\napproaching that camp was in chaos."},"1771":{"dur":1,"text":"The Red Cross was coming in."},"1772":{"dur":1,"text":"The Soviets were advancing."},"1774":{"dur":1,"text":"And Joe looked out one

going on?"},"1784":{"dur":2,"text":"And they said it's over."},"1787":{"dur":1,"text":"They're going to hide."},"1789":{"dur":2,"text":"And suddenly there was\nabout two or three days"},"1792":{"dur":2,"text":"that there was just\nchaos in the camp."},"1794":{"dur":2,"text":"Eventually it would be\nquarantined and shut down."},"1797":{"dur":2,"text":"But for a couple days\nthe gates were just open,"},"1799":{"dur":3,"text":"and Joe said there was a sign\npacked up saying you're free to go."},"1802":{"dur":2,"text":"And he was convinced\nthat if they walked"},"1805":{"dur":2,"text":"through that gate he would be shot."},"1808":{"dur":2,"text":"But he said I was so\nsick I didn't care."},"1811":{"dur":1,"text":"I was going to die anyway."},"1812":{"dur":4,"text":"And he simply with the help of\ntwo buddies walked out to freedom."},"1817":{"dur":6,"text":"And so while Joe's story is a\ntremendous story of heartache,"},"1823":{"dur":1,"text":"he never knew when he\nwas taken from his home"},"1825":{"dur":2,"text":"that he would never again see\nanother member of his family."},"1828":{"dur":3,"text":"He had no idea that he would\nnever again return to Poland."},"1832":{"dur":3,"text":"He has never been back home."},"1835":{"dur":1,"text":"That's something you\ncould keep in your prayers"},"1837":{"dur":2,"text":"because Joe is struggling\nwith this decision."},"1839":{"dur":3,"text":"He would really like to\ngo, but he's also worried"},"1843":{"dur":2,"text":"about going as you can imagine."},"1845":{"dur":1,"text":"You could also keep in your prayers"},"1847":{"dur":2,"text":"that we could find a\nphoto of his family."},"1849":{"dur":4,"text":"Joe said he would give anything\nfor one photo of his family."},"1853":{"dur":3,"text":"He says he can remember the\nfaces of his brothers as clearly"},"1857":{"dur":2,"text":"as if it were yesterday, but\nhe can no longer remember his"},"1859":{"dur":1,"text":"mother's face."},"1861":{"dur":2,"text":"So I just know there's a\nphoto out there somewhere."},"1863":{"dur":4,"text":"So, please, if you know anyone who\ncould help us find it let me know."},"1867":{"dur":2,"text":"That would be a tremendous\ngift we can give him."},"1870":{"dur":3,"text":"And Joe went on to live an\nextraordinary life afterwards."},"1873":{"dur":1,"text":"You'll have to find out more."},"1874":{"dur":1,"text":"We don't have a lot of time."},"1876":{"dur":4,"text":"But just briefly immediately after\nthe war he didn't know where to go."},"1880":{"dur":1,"text":"He knew he couldn't\ngo back to Poland."},"1881":{"dur":1,"text":"He didn't have a dime to his name."},"1883":{"dur":1,"text":"He was sick."},"1884":{"dur":5,"text":"He lost everything a human\nbeing can lose but his life."},"1890":{"dur":3,"text":"And his buddy next to him said, you\nknow, I'm Jewish, I'm from Germany,"},"1893":{"dur":2,"text":"I had a business before\nthe war, I'm going back."},"1895":{"dur":3,"text":"And, Joe, you should come\nback with me until you heal"},"1899":{"dur":1,"text":"until you know what else to do."},"1900":{"dur":4,"text":"And so of all places Joe\nwent back to Germany or went"},"1905":{"dur":1,"text":"to Germany after the war."},"1906":{"dur":2,"text":"And he's standing on a street\ncorner one day and a man taps him"},"1909":{"dur":3,"text":"on the shoulder and says,\nis that a Polish accent?"},"1912":{"dur":2,"text":"And Joe said, yes, and the man said,\nwell, I'm from Poland originally,"},"1915":{"dur":2,"text":"although he had lived in\nGermany during the war."},"1917":{"dur":1,"text":"And they got to talking,\nand he said,"},"1918":{"dur":1,"text":"would you like to come\nto my home for dinner?"},"1920":{"dur":1,"text":"And Joe said, sure."},"1921":{"dur":4,"text":"And the man said and, by the\nway, I have a beautiful daughter."},"1926":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, that beautiful daughter\nand Joe have now been married"},"1928":{"dur":3,"text":"over 65 years, actually 68 years,"},"1931":{"dur":4,"text":"and she is a German Catholic,\nmarried this Jewish man."},"1936":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's one of the\nbrilliant things"},"1937":{"dur":3,"text":"about Joe's story he tells everyone\nI don't care what religion you are."},"1941":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't care the color of your skin."},"1942":{"dur":1,"text":"We must love one another."},"1944":{"dur":3,"text":"And Joe lives that and\nbreathes that with every aspect"},"1947":{"dur":2,"text":"of his life including\nwho he married."},"1950":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think that's\none of the things,"},"1951":{"dur":1,"text":"the reason this story is\ntouching so many lives."},"1953":{"dur":3,"text":"It doesn't matter if people are\nJewish or Catholic or Protestant"},"1956":{"dur":3,"text":"or even Atheists are telling\nme this was having an impact."},"1959":{"dur":3,"text":"And to me that's another\nmiracle of Joe's story."},"1963":{"dur":2,"text":"So he went on to New York."},"1965":{"dur":1,"text":"He had an extraordinary career."},"1967":{"dur":1,"text":"He became one of the\nleading shoe designers"},"1969":{"dur":2,"text":"in New York if not the world."},"1971":{"dur":3,"text":"And he is just an incredibly,\njoy

he\ntalks about it just briefly,"},"2022":{"dur":6,"text":"was at one point -- the inmates were\ntattooed when they first got there."},"2028":{"dur":3,"text":"Joe said that he was brought back\nin

me,"},"2046":{"dur":3,"text":"whatever that means, and said\nI'm not giving you that sign."},"2049":{"dur":3,"text":"And he put on instead of\na triangle he put on a V"},"2052":{"dur":2,"text":"which meant political prisoner."},"2055":{"dur":4,"text":"And that designation, the\ndifference between a V"},"2059":{"dur":2,"text":"and a triangle was one line of ink."},"2062":{"dur":2,"text":"One stroke
