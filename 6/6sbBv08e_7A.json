stories?"},"92":{"dur":1,"text":"MANDY LEN CATRON:\nWell, I mean, I"},"93":{"dur":2,"text":"think there are a lot of\nproblems with love stories,"},"95":{"dur":1,"text":"actually."},"97":{"dur":2,"text":"I first started\nthinking about this--"},"99":{"dur":4,"text":"when I was 26, my parents\nsat my sister and I down"},"104":{"dur":2,"text":"and they were like, we don't\nlove each other anymore;"},"107":{"dur":1,"text":"we're getting a divorce."},"109":{"dur":1,"text":"And I was really

like,"},"119":{"dur":1,"text":"coming to terms with this."},"121":{"dur":2,"text":"And I started\nthinking about why."},"124":{"dur":2,"text":"And one of the things\nthat I came up with"},"126":{"dur":3,"text":"was that divorce felt\nlike the wrong ending"},"130":{"dur":3,"text":"to their love\nstory, And I started"},"133":{"dur":4,"text":"thinking about all the ways\nin which love stories had"},"137":{"dur":4,"text":"shaped me, like most of my\nideas about romantic love."},"141":{"dur":3,"text":"And I began to feel\nlike, you know,"},"145":{"dur":3,"text":"maybe I don't know very\nmuch about love at all."},"148":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I just started\ndoing lots of research,"},"150":{"dur":4,"text":"and very quickly I was like this\ntopic, which is basically just"},"155":{"dur":3,"text":"like the gap between\nhow we talk about love"},"159":{"dur":2,"text":"and how we actually\npractice it--"},"161":{"dur":2,"text":"and I mean, everything\nfrom romantic

did."},"178":{"dur":1,"text":"LOGAN URY: And now\nwe have your book."},"179":{"dur":1,"text":"MANDY LEN CATRON: Yeah."},"180":{"dur":2,"text":"But I guess the short\nanswer to your question"},"183":{"dur":4,"text":"is essentially love stories\nsuggest that there's"},"188":{"dur":3,"text":"a right way to practice love\nand that if you practice it"},"192":{"dur":2,"text":"that way then you'll be happy."},"194":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think that often--"},"197":{"dur":3,"text":"really often-- that's just not\nthe case, that actually love"},"200":{"dur":2,"text":"is a lot more\ncomplicated than that."},"203":{"dur":1,"text":"LOGAN URY: So speaking\nof being complicated,"},"205":{"dur":2,"text":"in your book and essays, you\nsay that the 36 questions are"},"208":{"dur":2,"text":"compelling because they\ncreate vulnerability"},"210":{"dur":1,"text":"and the chance for people\nto connect and feel"},"212":{"dur":2,"text":"known, yet many people\nhave

how"},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"people have interpreted it?"},"231":{"dur":2,"text":"MANDY LEN CATRON: Yeah,\nit's really strange."},"233":{"dur":2,"text":"It's been a strange experience."},"235":{"dur":7,"text":"I think I started writing this\nbook about five years before I"},"242":{"dur":2,"text":"published the article\nin the New York Times."},"245":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I had been thinking\nlike really long and hard"},"248":{"dur":2,"text":"about the role of love\nstories in our culture,"},"251":{"dur":1,"text":"and one of the things\nthat always bothered"},"252":{"dur":5,"text":"me is that I felt like people\nreally wanted a simple story"},"258":{"dur":5,"text":"and they liked sort of a really\nclean and tidy narrative."},"264":{"dur":6,"text":"And it was very strange,\nthen, to basically watch,"},"270":{"dur":1,"text":"because this article\nwas published."},"272":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think within a\nmonth it had gotten, like,"},"275":{"dur":3,"text":"8 million views, which is crazy."},"278":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I was reading about my\nown relationship in the news,"},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"and people would\nsay things like,"},"284":{"dur":2,"text":"they fell in love by\nthe end of the evening"},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"or this is how she\nmet her

pressure."},"303":{"dur":1,"text":"MANDY LEN CATRON: Yeah."},"304":{"dur":1,"text":"So it was really strange."},"306":{"dur":2,"text":"And the other thing that\nwas interesting to me"},"308":{"dur":2,"text":"is that people would say--"},"311":{"dur":3,"text":"and when I say people, I\nmean journalists, but also I"},"314":{"dur":4,"text":"spoke to a couple of\neditors about the book--"},"319":{"dur":3,"text":"and everybody would ask the\nsame question, which is, are you"},"322":{"dur":1,"text":"guys still together."},"324":{"dur":2,"text":"And when I said yes,\nthey were like, oh,"},"326":{"dur":3,"text":"my God, that's so great."},"330":{"dur":3,"text":"And it was great,\nbut I felt like there"},"333":{"dur":2,"text":"were much more interesting\nthings to say about it."},"336":{"dur":1,"text":"But people didn't care."},"337":{"dur":1,"text":"They didn't want to hear that."},"339":{"dur":2,"text":"They just want to\nknow that it worked."},"341":{"dur":1,"text":"LOGAN URY: But people must come\nup to you and say, I tried it,"},"343":{"dur":1,"text":"and we didn't fall in love."},"344":{"dur":2,"text":"MANDY LEN CATRON: Yeah,\nthey have said that."},"346":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'm like, that's because\nthere is no guarantee that"},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"doing this equals\nromantic love, but it"},"352":{"dur":4,"text":"does seem pretty good\nat creating closeness."},"356":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think going into\nit with that in mind"},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"is maybe a better\nway to approach it."},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"But I've realized\nthat it really doesn't"},"365":{"dur":2,"text":"matter what I say about this."},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"The study has taken\non a life of its own"},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"that is sort of\nseparate from me."},"373":{"dur":1,"text":"LOGAN URY: So in your\nbook, you discuss"},"375":{"dur":1,"text":"unconventional\nrelationships that we"},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"don't hear about in love\nstories like \"Cinderella\""},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"or romantic comedies\nlike \"Notting Hill.\""},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"You live in Vancouver,\nwe're here in the Bay Area,"},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"and these are places\nwhere different types"},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"of relationships\nare more accepted."},"388":{"dur":2,"text":"In

be your\nadvice for people"},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"who are unfamiliar with\nunconventional relationships,"},"399":{"dur":1,"text":"such as open marriages?"},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"And what would you say for\npeople watching this online who"},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"live somewhere where\nthose partnerships are"},"406":{"dur":1,"text":"more stigmatized?"},"407":{"dur":1,"text":"MANDY LEN CATRON:\nYeah, I mean, so one"},"409":{"dur":3,"text":"of the things that I found when\nI was researching this book"},"413":{"dur":4,"text":"is that many love stories\nhave the effect of really"},"417":{"dur":4,"text":"just narrowing our sense of\nwhat love can look like and sort"},"422":{"dur":4,"text":"of channeling it into this\nlike dominant practice of love."},"426":{"dur":3,"text":"And that practice is what I call\nthe love-marriage-baby carriage"},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"trajectory."},"432":{"dur":2,"text":"Because ultimately love is\na biological experience,"},"435":{"dur":1,"text":"but it's also very social."},"437":{"dur":6,"text":"And what we do with those\nbiological sorts of impulses"},"443":{"dur":3,"text":"is very much channeled by\nthe culture that we live in."},"446":{"dur":5,"text":"And so most of the stories\nwe consume I think really,"},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"like I was saying\nearlier, suggest"},"453":{"dur":3,"text":"that this is the way to be\nhappy and that if you're not"},"456":{"dur":4,"text":"practicing love this way\nthen you're sort of failing."},"461":{"dur":5,"text":"But actually, if you look at\nthe history of romantic love"},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"and the history of marriage, one\nof the things you'll discover"},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"is that love and\nmarriage have only"},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"been very tightly\ninterconnected for, like,"},"474":{"dur":3,"text":"the past 200 or so years."},"477":{"dur":4,"text":"And so this idea that\nwe think is normal"},"482":{"dur":3,"text":"and maybe even universal, which\nis that you find one person"},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"and you want to spend the\nrest of your life with them"},"487":{"dur":3,"text":"and you have this intense\npassionate love forever,"},"491":{"dur":4,"text":"is really a fairly new idea\nin the history of humanity."},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think it's interesting\nto think about it that way."},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"And once you start\nthinking about it that way,"},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"you realize there are actually\nlots of different ways"},"504":{"dur":1,"text":"to practice love."},"505":{"dur":1,"text":"And so one of the\nthings that I found"},"507":{"dur":3,"text":"is that what I wanted\nfrom a love story changed"},"511":{"dur":4,"text":"a lot over the course of writing\nthe book, and by the time"},"515":{"dur":1,"text":"I got to the end of\nthe process, what"},"516":{"dur":4,"text":"I found is that it was much\nmore interested in stories"},"521":{"dur":4,"text":"that sort of widened our\nsense of what love could be."},"525":{"dur":1,"text":"And those would be\nthings like stories"},"527":{"dur":3,"text":"about non-monogamous\nrelationships,"},"530":{"dur":4,"text":"queer relationships, even\nstories about relationships"},"535":{"dur":3,"text":"that are short but\nmeaningful, like something"},"538":{"dur":3,"text":"that doesn't last your whole\nlife but still is important."},"541":{"dur":3,"text":"And so anything where\nwe sort of approach"},"544":{"dur":3,"text":"love with a real\ncomplexity and look"},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"for what makes it meaningful in\nour lives instead of thinking"},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"about how it's supposed to be--"},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"those kinds of\nstories, I think, are"},"556":{"dur":4,"text":"the kinds of stories that we\nshould all be seeking out more."},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think the\nadvantage of looking"},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"for those kinds of stories\nis that, ultimately, you"},"565":{"dur":5,"text":"have a broader sense of\npossibility of what love might"},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"look like, and then you\nhave a better chance"},"573":{"dur":3,"text":"of creating the kinds of\nrelationships in your life"},"577":{"dur":4,"text":"that work for you,\nwhich I think is great."},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"LOGAN URY: So what\nwould your advice"},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"be for somebody who\nmaybe hasn't had success"},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"with monogamous relationships\nor is like, oh, what"},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"else is out there, I don't\nsee a lot of examples of that?"},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"MANDY LEN CATRON: Yeah, and\nnon-monogamy I sometimes"},"593":{"dur":4,"text":"feel like is like\nthe final frontier"},"597":{"dur":4,"text":"of romantic relationships\nin our culture,"},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"because it is so stigmatized."},"605":{"dur":3,"text":"But I do think that's changing."},"608":{"dur":4,"text":"A good friend of mine wrote this\ngreat book called \"What Love Is"},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"and What It Could Be.\""},"614":{"dur":4,"text":"And her name is Carrie Jenkins,\nand she's a philosopher at UBC."},"618":{"dur":5,"text":"And she really thinks about\nthe biological science"},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"of romantic love\nand how that sort"},"626":{"dur":3,"text":"of relates to our\nsocial impulses"},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"for what love looks like,\nand she essentially suggests"},"632":{"dur":4,"text":"that it is possible to change\nour ideas about romantic love"},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"but that it takes\ntime and practice"},"639":{"dur":4,"text":"and opening ourselves\nup to new possibilities"},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"for how it might be practiced."},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"So I would recommend that\npeople read her book,"},"648":{"dur":1,"text":"because I think it's great."},"650":{"dur":1,"text":"LOGAN URY: It's interesting."},"651":{"dur":1,"text":"So you mentioned new ways\nfor love to be practiced."},"653":{"dur":1,"text":"I really enjoyed your\nnewest Modern Love"},"655":{"dur":4,"text":"essay, which was about Mark and\nMandy's relationship contract."},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"And it includes commitments\nfor the next 12 months"},"662":{"dur":3,"text":"of a relationship, such as how\nhe'll do chores, save money,"},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"and even have sex."},"667":{"dur":1,"text":"For some people,\nthere's nothing less"},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"sexy than signing a contract,\nyet you called the experience"},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"empowering."},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"Tell us more about why\nyou created this contract"},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"and how it's changed\nyour relationship."},"679":{"dur":1,"text":"MANDY LEN CATRON:\nSo basically, one"},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"of the nice things about\nwriting about romantic love"},"683":{"dur":5,"text":"is that people send you things\nall the time, like articles"},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"and books and whatever."},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"People, once they know\nyou're interested in it,"},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"they are always sharing ideas\nwith you, which is great."},"695":{"dur":3,"text":"So one of the things\nthat a friend of mine"},"698":{"dur":4,"text":"sent me was this book called\n\"The New I Do,\" and it was just"},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"ways of re-conceptualizing\nmarriage."},"706":{"dur":4,"text":"And in it, she had a chapter\ncalled \"The Starter Marriage.\""},"710":{"dur":3,"text":"And basically the idea was\nthat you would have a two year"},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"marriage and you\nwould sign a contract,"},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"and then at the end\nof that two years"},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"you could decide if you really\nwanted to be with this person."},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"And Mark and I were\nreading it fairly early"},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"in our relationship\nand we both thought"},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"it was an interesting idea."},"728":{"dur":3,"text":"And so then a year\nafter that, we"},"732":{"dur":4,"text":"were trying to decide whether\nor not to move in together,"},"736":{"dur":3,"text":"and I think we both had a\nlot of anxieties about it."},"740":{"dur":1,"text":"And for me--"},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"I feel like I can only really\nspeak for myself here--"},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"but my anxieties were\nreally to do with the fact"},"745":{"dur":4,"text":"that I was in a long\nrelationship from age 20 to 30,"},"750":{"dur":1,"text":"and then when I got out\nof that relationship,"},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"one of the things\nthat I discovered"},"754":{"dur":1,"text":"that was so amazing\nabout being single"},"755":{"dur":3,"text":"was just being like fully\nin charge of my own time."},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"And I just had no idea\nhow great that would be."},"762":{"dur":5,"text":"And I was scared that once I\nstarted living with someone"},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"again that I would give that up."},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"Because I think I\nhave this tendency"},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"to sort of like really deeply\ninvest in my relationships,"},"775":{"dur":4,"text":"which is not a bad thing."},"779":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I wanted some way to\nfeel like there would be space"},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"for me in my own relationship."},"785":{"dur":3,"text":"And so Mark actually suggested,\nhey, what about that contract"},"789":{"dur":1,"text":"thing that we read about?"},"791":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we sat down one night\na week before he moved in,"},"794":{"dur":2,"text":"and we just went over\neverything, everything"},"797":{"dur":1,"text":"that we could think of."},"798":{"dur":1,"text":"And a lot of people\nthink, oh, my God."},"800":{"dur":1,"text":"A lot of the comments\nin the New York"},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"Times in response to\nthis article was like,"},"804":{"dur":1,"text":"are you guys robots?"},"805":{"dur":4,"text":"It sounds so cold-hearted\nand calculating,"},"810":{"dur":1,"text":"but it's really not at all."},"812":{"dur":1,"text":"It's really about\nthe spirit of things."},"814":{"dur":2,"text":"So the sex part people\nwere very concerned about."},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"It's really just like,\nthis is an important part"},"819":{"dur":0,"text":"of our relationship."},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"It's something we\nboth value, and we"},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"agree that we're going\nto be monogamous for now."},"825":{"dur":5,"text":"But we want it to be open to\nchanging that, because we want"},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"to be open to changing\neverything, I guess,"},"833":{"dur":2,"text":"and acknowledging\nthat people do change"},"835":{"dur":1,"text":"and that our needs change."},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's something I\nthink so nice about that,"},"839":{"dur":3,"text":"because I just\nreally felt heard."},"842":{"dur":2,"text":"And I never felt heard in a\nrelationship quite like that"},"845":{"dur":2,"text":"before and that\nmy needs mattered,"},"848":{"dur":4,"text":"and I think probably that was\ngreat for both of us, which"},"852":{"dur":1,"text":"LOGAN URY: What are some other\nthings you included that maybe"},"854":{"dur":1,"text":"would have been\nawkward to bring up"},"856":{"dur":2,"text":"outside of writing a contract?"},"858":{"dur":2,"text":"MANDY LEN CATRON: Well,\none of them is marriage."},"860":{"dur":2,"text":"So I talked about that."},"863":{"dur":4,"text":"Because it sort of\ncame out one night"},"868":{"dur":6,"text":"that he felt a lot of pressure\nto decide to get a ring"},"874":{"dur":3,"text":"and do a proposal, and I\ngot really upset about this."},"878":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think that\nwas because I felt"},"879":{"dur":3,"text":"like we had been so intentional\nabout so many things"},"883":{"dur":1,"text":"in our relationship."},"884":{"dur":3,"text":"It just seemed to me\nweird that this would be"},"887":{"dur":2,"text":"a decision that he made alone."},"890":{"dur":4,"text":"And so that was like a month\nbefore we renewed our contract."},"894":{"dur":1,"text":"So then, when we sat\ndown to renew it,"},"896":{"dur":2,"text":"we just said, OK, what do\nyou think about marriage"},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"and is this something\nwe want to do?"},"901":{"dur":4,"text":"And it was really nice just to\nhave a really open conversation"},"905":{"dur":0,"text":"about it."},"906":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, I should be honest."},"911":{"dur":2,"text":"It helps that it's my job\nto think about these things."},"914":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's much easier to bring\nthem up in conversation"},"917":{"dur":4,"text":"because I'm thinking\nabout them all the time."},"921":{"dur":4,"text":"Because we're always trying\nto practice, because he's"},"925":{"dur":2,"text":"really a good sport."},"928":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'm always was\nlike, oh, I read this"},"931":{"dur":2,"text":"about the research of\nromantic love today."},"934":{"dur":3,"text":"Recently, I think
