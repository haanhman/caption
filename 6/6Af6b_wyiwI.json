epidemic."},"80":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's look at Ebola."},"81":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm sure all of you read about it \nin the newspaper,"},"85":{"dur":1,"text":"lots of tough challenges."},"87":{"dur":3,"text":"I followed it carefully \nthrough the case analysis tools"},"90":{"dur":4,"text":"we use to track polio eradication."},"95":{"dur":1,"text":"And as you look at what went on,"},"97":{"dur":4,"text":"the problem wasn't that there was a system\nthat didn't work well enough,"},"102":{"dur":3,"text":"the problem was that we \ndidn't have a system at all."},"106":{"dur":4,"text":"In fact, there's some pretty obvious\nkey missing pieces."},"111":{"dur":4,"text":"We didn't have a group of epidemiologists \nready to go, who would have gone,"},"115":{"dur":3,"text":"seen what the disease was,\nseen how far it had spread."},"119":{"dur":2,"text":"The case reports came in on paper."},"122":{"dur":2,"text":"It was very delayed\nbefore they were put online"},"124":{"dur":1,"text":"and they were extremely inaccurate."},"127":{"dur":2,"text":"We didn't have a medical team ready to go."},"129":{"dur":2,"text":"We didn't have a way of

\nwhat tools should be used."},"162":{"dur":3,"text":"As an example, we could have \ntaken the blood of survivors,"},"165":{"dur":5,"text":"processed it, and put that plasma\nback in people to protect them."},"171":{"dur":2,"text":"But that was never tried."},"173":{"dur":1,"text":"So there was a lot that was missing."},"175":{"dur":3,"text":"And these things \nare really a global

Hollywood."},"202":{"dur":3,"text":"The failure to prepare \ncould allow the next epidemic"},"205":{"dur":3,"text":"to be dramatically \nmore devastating than Ebola"},"210":{"dur":4,"text":"Let's look at the progression \nof Ebola over this year."},"216":{"dur":2,"text":"About 10,000 people died,"},"219":{"dur":4,"text":"and nearly all were in the three\nWest African countries."},"223":{"dur":2,"text":"There's three reasons why\nit didn't spread more."},"226":{"dur":4,"text":"The first is that there was a lot \nof heroic work by the health workers."},"230":{"dur":3,"text":"They found the people and they \nprevented more infections."},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"The second is the nature of the virus."},"236":{"dur":3,"text":"Ebola does not spread through the air."},"239":{"dur":2,"text":"And by the time you're contagious,"},"241":{"dur":2,"text":"most people are so sick \nthat they're bedridden."},"246":{"dur":4,"text":"Third, it didn't get\ninto many urban areas."},"250":{"dur":1,"text":"And that was just luck."},"252":{"dur":2,"text":"If it had gotten into a lot \nmore urban areas,"},"254":{"dur":3,"text":"the case numbers \nwould have been much larger."},"257":{"dur":3,"text":"So next time, we might not be so lucky."},"261":{"dur":5,"text":"You can have a virus where people \nfeel well enough while they're infectious"},"266":{"dur":3,"text":"that they get on a plane\nor they go to a market."},"269":{"dur":3,"text":"The source of the virus could be \na natural epidemic like Ebola,"},"272":{"dur":1,"text":"or it could be bioterrorism."},"274":{"dur":4,"text":"So there are things that would literally\nmake things a thousand times worse."},"279":{"dur":6,"text":"In fact, let's look at a model\nof a virus spread through the air,"},"285":{"dur":3,"text":"like the Spanish Flu back in 1918."},"289":{"dur":1,"text":"So here's what would happen:"},"291":{"dur":3,"text":"It would spread throughout the world\nvery, very quickly."},"295":{"dur":5,"text":"And you can see over 30 million people\ndied from that epidemic."},"300":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is a serious problem."},"302":{"dur":1,"text":"We should be concerned."},"304":{"dur":4,"text":"But in fact, we can build\na really good response system."},"308":{"dur":5,"text":"We have the benefits of all the science\nand technology that we talk about here."},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"We've got cell phones"},"314":{"dur":3,"text":"to get information from the public \nand get information out to them."},"318":{"dur":4,"text":"We have satellite maps where we can see\nwhere people are and where they're moving."},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"We have advances in biology"},"324":{"dur":3,"text":"that should dramatically change \nthe turnaround time to look at a pathogen"},"328":{"dur":4,"text":"and be able to make drugs and vaccines\nthat fit for that pathogen."},"333":{"dur":1,"text":"So we can have tools,"},"334":{"dur":4,"text":"but those tools need to be put\ninto an overall global health system."},"339":{"dur":2,"text":"And we need preparedness."},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"The best lessons, I think, \non how to get prepared"},"344":{"dur":2,"text":"are again, what we do for war."},"346":{"dur":4,"text":"For soldiers, we have full-time,\nwaiting to go."},"351":{"dur":3,"text":"We have reserves that can scale \nus up to large numbers."},"354":{"dur":3,"text":"NATO has a mobile unit \nthat can deploy very rapidly."},"358":{"dur":3,"text":"NATO does a lot of war games \nto check, are people well trained?"},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"Do they understand \nabout fuel and logistics"},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"and the same radio frequencies?"},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"So they are absolutely ready to go."},"368":{"dur":4,"text":"So those are the kinds of things\nwe need to deal with an epidemic."},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"What are the key pieces?"},"375":{"dur":5,"text":"First, we need strong health systems\nin poor countries."},"380":{"dur":3,"text":"That's where mothers \ncan give birth safely,"},"383":{"dur":1,"text":"kids can get all their vaccines."},"385":{"dur":4,"text":"But, also where we'll see \nthe outbreak very early on."},"390":{"dur":1,"text":"We need a medical reserve corps:"},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"lots of people who've got \nthe training and background"},"394":{"dur":3,"text":"who are ready to go, with the expertise."},"397":{"dur":4,"text":"And then we need to pair those\nmedical people with the military."},"402":{"dur":4,"text":"taking advantage of the military's ability\nto move fast, do logistics"},"406":{"dur":1,"text":"and secure areas."},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"We need to do simulations,"},"411":{"dur":4,"text":"germ games, not war games,\nso that we see where the holes are."},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"The last time a germ game \nwas done in the United States"},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"was back in 2001, \nand it didn't go so well."},"422":{"dur":5,"text":"So far the score is germs: 1, people: 0."},"427":{"dur":6,"text":"Finally, we need lots of advanced R&D\nin areas of vaccines and diagnostics."},"433":{"dur":3,"text":"There are some big breakthroughs, \nlike the Adeno-associated virus,"},"437":{"dur":3,"text":"that could work very, very quickly."},"441":{"dur":3,"text":"Now I don't have an exact budget\nfor what this would cost,"},"444":{"dur":4,"text":"but I'm quite sure it's very modest\ncompared to the potential harm."},"449":{"dur":4,"text":"The World Bank estimates that \nif we have a worldwide flu epidemic,"},"453":{"dur":3,"text":"global wealth will go down\nby over three trillion dollars"},"457":{"dur":3,"text":"and we'd have millions\nand millions of deaths."},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"These investments \noffer significant benefits"},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"beyond just being ready for the epidemic."},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"The primary healthcare, the R&D,"},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"those things would reduce \nglobal health equity"},"471":{"dur":3,"text":"and make the world more just \nas well as more safe."},"475":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think this should absolutely\nbe a priority."},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"There's no need to panic."},"480":{"dur":4,"text":"We don't have to hoard cans of spaghetti\nor go down into the basement."},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"But we need to get going,\nbecause time is not on our side."},"489":{"dur":6,"text":"In fact, if there's one positive thing\nthat can come out of the Ebola epidemic,"},"495":{"dur":5,"text":"it's that it can serve as an early \nwarning, a wake-up call, to get ready."},"501":{"dur":5,"text":"If we start now, we can be ready \nfor the next epidemic."},"506":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you."},"508":{"dur":3,"text":"(Applause)"}}
