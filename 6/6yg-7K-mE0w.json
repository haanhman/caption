you"},"371":{"dur":1,"text":"don't even know them"},"373":{"dur":4,"text":"but the point is that there someone\nelse's interest in education skilled in"},"377":{"dur":0,"text":"the

not"},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"you know we're all here all those\nstudents are paying for these courses"},"396":{"dur":3,"text":"why don't we actually put in the work\nmake him think about what they're doing"},"399":{"dur":3,"text":"and what they find is that if you go in\ndig into the literature"},"402":{"dur":3,"text":"the cognitive psychologists right they\nsay that you know"},"405":{"dur":3,"text":"we as humans have a really short\nattention span apparently getting"},"409":{"dur":3,"text":"right with cell phones and everything\nelse but at the same time they say"},"413":{"dur":4,"text":"if you're interested in the topic your\ninterest starts to wane after about 20"},"417":{"dur":0,"text":"minutes"},"418":{"dur":4,"text":"so a lot times what I try to do

idea"},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"resetting with active learning can help\nwith attention and then"},"448":{"dur":3,"text":"likewise is going to help a retention as\nwell so"},"452":{"dur":3,"text":"let's look at this from a student\nperspective you know I remember whenever"},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"I was an undergrad"},"456":{"dur":3,"text":"i got really nervous whenever"},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"I wanted to answer question\nEngineering's heart"},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"I think it's really difficult our\nstudents think it's difficult"},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"and thing is is that I ain't wanna sound\nlike a fall"},"469":{"dur":3,"text":"in front of all the people that were in\nthe room with me all my colleagues and"},"473":{"dur":3,"text":"so likewise if I ever had a professor"},"477":{"dur":3,"text":"who may be noticed that I didn't answer\nany questions"},"480":{"dur":3,"text":"and then he says the question says\nCooper what do you think"},"483":{"dur":4,"text":"I would price freak out be really upset\nand mumble like"},"488":{"dur":3,"text":"oh I don't know and then I would hate\nthat Professor"},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"for ever right"},"494":{"dur":3,"text":"yeah I don't want that to happen why not\nlet students especially if they're"},"497":{"dur":0,"text":"nervous"},"498":{"dur":3,"text":"why not let them ballots an idea that\nthey have of a colleague"},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"you made all the difference if I just\nkinda said to the person next to me"},"504":{"dur":4,"text":"do you also think that the pump capacity\nis gonna be higher"},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"for this pressure is going to be lowered\nyou also think that okay great now I"},"512":{"dur":3,"text":"don't feel so bad because someone else\nfeels the same way that idea"},"516":{"dur":3,"text":"right so students also sometimes say"},"519":{"dur":4,"text":"you know when are we ever going to use\nthis I want more real-life challenges"},"523":{"dur":3,"text":"working with somebody else that maybe\nyou don't know that's a real life"},"527":{"dur":0,"text":"challenge"},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"that's what they're gonna be pose with\nwhenever they go out to work in industry"},"531":{"dur":4,"text":"it's not like Uganda industry and they\nsay okay well this is your first day"},"536":{"dur":3,"text":"tell us who you want to work with tell\nus the way you want to work"},"539":{"dur":3,"text":"and will totally cater to you it's not\nthe way it works whoever"},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"you essentially is here going to work\nwith and you're gonna have to be able to"},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"work together towards a common goal"},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's when things are really want\nto instill nurse"},"551":{"dur":3,"text":"and sometimes teams will be reluctant at\nfirst like Brian"},"554":{"dur":3,"text":"but his a checking his email itself\nanswer to pick on you bright"},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"but you know the thing is to is that\nthere will be some students who were"},"561":{"dur":0,"text":"just"},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"too cool for school right thing I say\nthis active learning stuff"},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"is garbage and I'm personally not\ninterested in it"},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"and there are few things you can do for\ninstance I make my active learning"},"573":{"dur":0,"text":"exercises"},"574":{"dur":3,"text":"on the tough stuff the things that are\nreally difficult to understand"},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"so basically if they don't participate\nwell"},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"wait until that tough stuff shows up on\nan exam and you can participate in the"},"584":{"dur":1,"text":"activities that we did"},"585":{"dur":3,"text":"students catch on really fast but\nanother thing"},"589":{"dur":3,"text":"even if we go through and there's a few\nholdouts in there will be"},"593":{"dur":4,"text":"I finds about one or two when fifty\nFrank there'll be some people who are"},"597":{"dur":3,"text":"completely check out they're not gonna\nlisten to you at all"},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"and the rest to the students they're\ndoing their thing talking to each other"},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"trying to come up with answers like I\nwant them to I don't lose five seconds"},"608":{"dur":0,"text":"asleep"},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"over those students that are paying\nattention cuz you know what I got the"},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"other ninety some-odd percent of them"},"614":{"dur":3,"text":"all talking about what I wanted them to\ntalk about and being involved in the"},"617":{"dur":0,"text":"course"},"618":{"dur":3,"text":"for the students who don't want to\nparticipate that's on them"},"621":{"dur":3,"text":"right again they're paying me up here to\nteach them"},"624":{"dur":4,"text":"if they don't want to participate that's\ntheir problem so"},"628":{"dur":4,"text":"what makes a good active learning\nexercise I avoid the trivial questions"},"633":{"dur":7,"text":"see what happened here as my AP get back"},"643":{"dur":7,"text":"ok"},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"ok oh maybe let's see"},"656":{"dur":3,"text":"now there we go"},"659":{"dur":3,"text":"try this again"},"663":{"dur":5,"text":"her"},"668":{"dur":3,"text":"out active learning exercise ok okay"},"671":{"dur":4,"text":"there we go sorry for the technical\nsnafu guys"},"676":{"dur":3,"text":"okay avoid trivial questions"},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"this is actually one of the key things\nthat people whenever they first tri"},"682":{"dur":0,"text":"active learning"},"683":{"dur":3,"text":"is one of things that they don't quite\nget right they"},"687":{"dur":3,"text":"make that questions way too easy to the\npoint that you don't need to talk to"},"691":{"dur":1,"text":"anybody else about"},"692":{"dur":4,"text":"rank instead they just say they turned\ntheir neighbor and say they say"},"696":{"dur":0,"text":"something like"},"697":{"dur":3,"text":"all the answers hi right yeah and then\nthat's it and then you're giving them"},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"another minute to talk about it"},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"but they've already found out the answer\nand most the class has two"},"706":{"dur":3,"text":"well now you've wasted that 45 seconds\nor whatever the you're giving them to"},"710":{"dur":0,"text":"talk about it"},"711":{"dur":3,"text":"it's not really what you wanna do you\nwanna make these questions difficulty"},"714":{"dur":1,"text":"can focus on the heart topics"},"716":{"dur":3,"text":"focus on the things you're gonna test\nthem on right so that then they can talk"},"720":{"dur":2,"text":"over with one other colleagues and they\ncan figure out what they want"},"722":{"dur":5,"text":"also you wanna make the short you wanna\nmake about fifteen seconds to 3 minutes"},"728":{"dur":1,"text":"3 minutes maximum"},"730":{"dur":3,"text":"if you make them too long again you're\ngoing to have some people were gonna be"},"733":{"dur":1,"text":"done the really good ones"},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"will be done in like two minutes and if\nyou're giving them eight minutes to"},"737":{"dur":1,"text":"complete the exercise"},"739":{"dur":3,"text":"again you've lost those six minutes\nafter your lecture you don't want to do"},"742":{"dur":0,"text":"that"},"743":{"dur":4,"text":"also teams have to 24 you know if we\nhave a group like"},"747":{"dur":3,"text":"three people all sitting together it's\nfine it doesn't need to be two people"},"751":{"dur":0,"text":"can be three"},"752":{"dur":4,"text":"it can be four whatever its whatevers\nmanageable right 24 tends to work really"},"756":{"dur":4,"text":"and also I call on people at random I\nlet my students know that"},"761":{"dur":3,"text":"you don't want to use volunteers or else\nif they catch on that you're going to"},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"always go for volunteers after the\nactive learning exercises"},"767":{"dur":3,"text":"the rest them just won't participate\nbecause they know somebody the intrepid"},"771":{"dur":3,"text":"in the front right they're going to be\nright on top of it so instead you go"},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"around you ask questions to everybody"},"777":{"dur":3,"text":"right and I try to ask every single\nperson something over the course the"},"781":{"dur":0,"text":"semester"},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"so that they know they eventually it's\ngoing to be their time"},"784":{"dur":3,"text":"your also you want to discuss the\nanswers after you get them sable with"},"788":{"dur":1,"text":"that a good answer"},"789":{"dur":4,"text":"that bad answer and then why but you\nnever want to insult"},"794":{"dur":3,"text":"a student's answer say something like\nwell that saddam answer"},"797":{"dur":3,"text":"or you really should have thought about\nthat more right because you're gonna"},"801":{"dur":3,"text":"you're gonna lose them in a big part of\nbeing a good teacher I think"},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"is having that student-teacher\nrelationship be really strong"},"809":{"dur":3,"text":"right you want the students don't\nnecessarily need to like you but they"},"812":{"dur":1,"text":"need to trust you"},"813":{"dur":3,"text":"and if you say something like that's a\nstupid answer"},"817":{"dur":3,"text":"the trust is gone right and you want to\navoid that"},"820":{"dur":3,"text":"so what can you ask about well"},"823":{"dur":4,"text":"the content is only limited by your\nimagination so I've slots a question 3"},"827":{"dur":3,"text":"unsteady state processes are great\nbecause they're really tough to"},"831":{"dur":0,"text":"understand"},"832":{"dur":3,"text":"I think so I ask lots of questions I'm\nfrom West

process variables\nlike concentration"},"843":{"dur":3,"text":"upon all in the moonshine still as time\npasses"},"847":{"dur":3,"text":"well its gonna go down crews are boiling\nout the ethanol"},"850":{"dur":3,"text":"well what about the ethanol\nconcentration in the distal it"},"853":{"dur":4,"text":"you know what's coming out stencil often\njust say what has to be going up Friday"},"857":{"dur":4,"text":"now it goes down to because again you're\ngetting rid of the ethanol"},"862":{"dur":3,"text":"what's left in the still is lean and\nethanol"},"865":{"dur":3,"text":"as time passes so that's a tough\nquestion"},"868":{"dur":3,"text":"and again getting since the talk with\neach other and maybe they disagree"},"871":{"dur":0,"text":"initially"},"872":{"dur":3,"text":"and then they to convince each other\nwhich ones right that's learning that"},"876":{"dur":2,"text":"they're doing on their own

important also real-world\napplications"},"886":{"dur":3,"text":"this is something that's key because it\nvery easy to get lost in just"},"889":{"dur":3,"text":"be rebooked learning all that kinda\nthing whenever you're in a lecture"},"893":{"dur":3,"text":"how can you apply that knowledge how can\nyou apply that forced convection is"},"896":{"dur":1,"text":"better than natural

Cheese so you blow on"},"906":{"dur":4,"text":"so-called of passers forced convection\nthat's the difference he ranked"},"910":{"dur":3,"text":"so these kinda things are really good"},"914":{"dur":1,"text":"active learning questions to ask"},"915":{"dur":3,"text":"ask you can ask anything you want\nanything that you come up with a lot of"},"919":{"dur":2,"text":"times I don't scrape my active learning"},"921":{"dur":3,"text":"whenever I'm talking and like out here\nsomething I kinda wanna ask"},"924":{"dur":2,"text":"was just ask the students"},"927":{"dur":2,"text":"and then a lot of times you get really\ngood responses"},"929":{"dur":3,"text":"you just keep asking until you get the\nresponse that you want and if you don't"},"933":{"dur":3,"text":"get the response that you want maybe you\ndidn't teach them very well"},"937":{"dur":3,"text":"maybe there's something that you missed\nout on and you know what that

need to"},"948":{"dur":1,"text":"do a better job"},"949":{"dur":4,"text":"this time we can talk about it and then\nnext time whenever I teach the class"},"953":{"dur":2,"text":"again I know I need to focus on that a\nlittle bit more"},"955":{"dur":3,"text":"so we talked about active learning"},"959":{"dur":3,"text":"and now we're going to talk about\nconceptual knowledge"},"962":{"dur":3,"text":"because you know a lot I try to do an\nactive warnings like"},"966":{"dur":2,"text":"will what's happening"},"968":{"dur":3,"text":"the real world application what would\nhappen as time passes"},"972":{"dur":4,"text":"and whatever you think about learning\nalways go back to Bloom's taxonomy"},"976":{"dur":3,"text":"if you're familiar with this it's a\nstudy that
