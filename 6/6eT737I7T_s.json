then"},"277":{"dur":3,"text":"and I remember how it affected the school"},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"that I was teaching in\nand we had to make cuts."},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's what they had to do."},"285":{"dur":3,"text":"And remember, back in the late '80s"},"289":{"dur":2,"text":"they had raised taxes."},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"And then it was referred"},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"and those income taxes were lowered"},"297":{"dur":2,"text":"and then the sales tax if you recall,"},"299":{"dur":4,"text":"back then it was 5 1\/2 cents or 5 1\/2%,"},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"and one day when they put it on the ballot"},"307":{"dur":1,"text":"they took it from a..."},"309":{"dur":2,"text":"It was proposed to go at a six."},"311":{"dur":1,"text":"They took it all the way back to five"},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"which is where we are today."},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"So, they didn't go back\nto the 5 1\/2 where it was,"},"317":{"dur":1,"text":"they went all the way back."},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"That caused the state to really"},"321":{"dur":1,"text":"have to tighten up the budgets."},"323":{"dur":1,"text":"And that was about shortly after that,"},"325":{"dur":3,"text":"I came in to the North Dakota\nHouse of Representatives."},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"- And why bring that up because"},"332":{"dur":1,"text":"it's a different landscape

tax"},"350":{"dur":3,"text":"and as you know, that's gonna\ntake a little bit of a hit"},"354":{"dur":4,"text":"because we say that every rig\nthat's drilling out there,"},"358":{"dur":5,"text":"when they drill a well\nit's $250,000 in sales tax."},"364":{"dur":1,"text":"And we're gonna miss that because"},"366":{"dur":3,"text":"there is definitely gonna\nbe a slowing of the

We would have two years\nto take a good look at it"},"391":{"dur":1,"text":"and get ready,"},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"but I would see us making some cuts"},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"in general fund spending."},"397":{"dur":1,"text":"And I would like to point out"},"398":{"dur":1,"text":"that if it stays like this"},"400":{"dur":4,"text":"there won't be any money\nin the strategic

North Dakota."},"412":{"dur":1,"text":"That won't be there."},"414":{"dur":1,"text":"The one that I really worry about"},"416":{"dur":3,"text":"is that we have this property tax"},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"reduction fund or relief fund"},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"which really is used for education."},"424":{"dur":3,"text":"You know the 125 mils\nthat we've taken over"},"428":{"dur":3,"text":"from local school districts,\nwe have to fund that."},"431":{"dur":3,"text":"And we probably would have to"},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"tap in and this is a good thing,"},"437":{"dur":3,"text":"the interest from the\nlegacy fund coming in"},"441":{"dur":1,"text":"would have to help us out there"},"442":{"dur":5,"text":"so we could sustain that\nto K through 12 education."},"448":{"dur":1,"text":"- And that's the insurance policy almost."},"450":{"dur":1,"text":"- It is, yes, it is."},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"- Since you brought up the Surge Bill,"},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"I wanted to get into that very briefly"},"457":{"dur":3,"text":"that was one of the big\npriorities to get that money"},"461":{"dur":1,"text":"for infrastructure development"},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"out to the Western North Dakota area,"},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"out to the oil patch as soon as possible"},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"and one hurdle was crossed today."},"469":{"dur":3,"text":"- Yes, we were able to\npass it in the senate today"},"472":{"dur":3,"text":"at pass I believe it was 44 to two."},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"There was one member\nof the senate missing."},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"And the two that voted against it,"},"481":{"dur":1,"text":"I understand their concerns."},"482":{"dur":3,"text":"They didn't vote against\nit because they thought"},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"they don't need the money out there."},"487":{"dur":1,"text":"They felt that there was a lot money"},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"to be sending out there."},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"But that strategic investment"},"494":{"dur":3,"text":"and infrastructure fund is for that."},"498":{"dur":3,"text":"And to me that is a top priority."},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"We need to get the people\nout there, the projects,"},"505":{"dur":1,"text":"the infrastructure out west"},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"to a point where they can\nkind of breathe again."},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is probably a good time, Dave,"},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"because there's a downturn"},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"or a correction out there that's going on"},"517":{"dur":4,"text":"and they will be able to\nget these projects done"},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"probably a little cheaper\nthan they would normally"},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"because there's gonna be labor available."},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"Contractors are gonna\nbe a little more hungry"},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"than they have been in the past."},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"And so the dollar will go\na lot further than it has"},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"in the past out in the oil patch."},"537":{"dur":4,"text":"- Plus the odd circumstance\nthat fuel prices are down."},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"- Fuel prices are down\nand believe it or not,"},"543":{"dur":5,"text":"we are starting to see\napartments open in Dickinson."},"550":{"dur":3,"text":"- Now that's interesting\nthat that happened because"},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"when the boom really hit,"},"556":{"dur":1,"text":"that was one of the things\npeople were talking about."},"558":{"dur":1,"text":"Rents went way up."},"559":{"dur":1,"text":"You couldn't find places to rent,"},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"you couldn't find places to stay"},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"in Dickinson, Watford City, Williston,"},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"all across the oil patch."},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"Now it's starting to ease up a bit."},"568":{"dur":3,"text":"- It is and so there are some good things."},"572":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we'll see how it plays\nout over here and how long"},"576":{"dur":3,"text":"but I would tend to think that"},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"the average rents are going to come down,"},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"some how much, I don't know."},"584":{"dur":4,"text":"We will still have to continue to promote"},"588":{"dur":3,"text":"the Housing Incentive Fund\nwhere we put money out."},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"It's kind of gap funding\nto help build homes"},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"that have affordable\nrents for those people"},"598":{"dur":5,"text":"that don't have the means\nto pay those high rents."},"603":{"dur":3,"text":"- Now there was money for that\nfund and some other things"},"607":{"dur":1,"text":"in what was called the Jumpstart Bill"},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"but the Jumpstart Bill\nwas killed in the senate."},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"Can you explain the thinking behind"},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"what's gonna happen there?"},"614":{"dur":3,"text":"- Well, we've talked to\nthe agencies involved"},"617":{"dur":3,"text":"in for example, Housing and Finance"},"621":{"dur":4,"text":"which has the Housing Incentive Fund."},"625":{"dur":1,"text":"We're gonna put it in their budget"},"626":{"dur":1,"text":"but we're gonna move\nthat as quickly as we can"},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"and put an emergency clause on it."},"630":{"dur":3,"text":"So, as soon as it gets signed"},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"they will be out there and\nthey will be available."},"636":{"dur":3,"text":"It might not go as quickly as the surge"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"however, I think the surge will have,"},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"will be in the house for a while."},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"So I don't think it's gonna go as fast"},"646":{"dur":1,"text":"as some people think."},"647":{"dur":3,"text":"Then there was also money, million dollars"},"651":{"dur":4,"text":"for the attorney general\nto do early hirings"},"655":{"dur":4,"text":"for agents out in the patch"},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"which is very important to us."},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"And also, the health\ndepartment had 2,000,000"},"665":{"dur":3,"text":"for early hirings out in the patch"},"668":{"dur":3,"text":"for inspectors, pipeline inspectors"},"671":{"dur":5,"text":"for all kinds of environmental\nreasons to be out there."},"677":{"dur":3,"text":"But we're putting them in their budgets"},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"and putting emergency clauses on them"},"683":{"dur":1,"text":"just to get them out\nas quickly as possible."},"685":{"dur":2,"text":"- And just so everybody\nknows an emergency clause"},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"takes a 2\/3 vote."},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"And if the emergency clause is put on"},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"then you don't have to\nwait until August 1st."},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"- That's right, as soon as\nthe governor signs the bill"},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"it's in effect."},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"- And there doesn't seem\nto be any opposition"},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"to spending money on the health department"},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"or the attorney general\nor on human trafficking."},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, prevention and enforcement"},"709":{"dur":1,"text":"and some of these other things,"},"711":{"dur":0,"text":"the housing and senate fund."},"712":{"dur":3,"text":"There doesn't seem to be a\nlot of opposition to that."},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"It's just how you handle it."},"717":{"dur":1,"text":"What might be the best way."},"718":{"dur":3,"text":"- And that's correct and I\nalso like to point out that"},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"in the budgets we still have to deal with"},"725":{"dur":1,"text":"salaries and stuff like that."},"727":{"dur":1,"text":"So there are some things"},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"that they really can't do any hiring"},"731":{"dur":1,"text":"until they know the salaries,"},"733":{"dur":1,"text":"and that will be in the budget."},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"So, we're gonna work to get them out."},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"That is absolutely correct."},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"Nobody is against them."},"741":{"dur":3,"text":"It's just a matter of how we're\nhandling it to get it out."},"744":{"dur":1,"text":"The other thing is"},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"we didn't want too many\nthings in that surge bill."},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"It has enough things in it already."},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"You start complicating\nit even more it could"},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"cause the bill to have some issues."},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"- So be it fair the statement\nsay that the surge bill was"},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"particularly and really almost limited"},"762":{"dur":1,"text":"to infrastructure projects."},"764":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Rich] That is correct Dave."},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"- So that's roads and bridges and perhaps,"},"768":{"dur":1,"text":"you know four laning and"},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"what they call truck reliever routes,"},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"what we used to call bypass routes."},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"- Absolutely and I want to tell you that"},"777":{"dur":3,"text":"we had the money last\nsession that went out for"},"780":{"dur":4,"text":"state highways and for\nthe reliever routes."},"784":{"dur":5,"text":"And right now, Watford\nCity, Alexander, Newtown,"},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"they all have the routes going around"},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"and it is fantastic."},"795":{"dur":3,"text":"It has changed the quality\nof life in those communities."},"798":{"dur":3,"text":"Williston will have theirs shortly"},"802":{"dur":3,"text":"after we get into the\nconstruction season this summer."},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"- From what I'm hearing from\nmy contacts in Williston"},"809":{"dur":1,"text":"that's going to make a huge difference."},"811":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Rich] It will, it will."},"814":{"dur":2,"text":"- As a leader of a caucus,"},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"does this whole budget uncertainty,"},"819":{"dur":2,"text":"does that make your job harder?"},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"- It does but what you do\nis you do a lot of educating"},"825":{"dur":3,"text":"and you do a lot of talking\nto the fiscal analyst"},"829":{"dur":3,"text":"up in legislative council and to OMB"},"832":{"dur":2,"text":"and tax department."},"835":{"dur":3,"text":"But you keep informing people"},"838":{"dur":2,"text":"and educating them as to what's going on."},"841":{"dur":2,"text":"But I want you to know I\nalso have ace in the hole."},"844":{"dur":2,"text":"Ray Holmberg, I have one of the best"},"846":{"dur":2,"text":"appropriations chairman\nthat you could have."},"851":{"dur":1,"text":"He's a wizard."},"853":{"dur":1,"text":"I have no one else to say"},"855":{"dur":1,"text":"but he does a great job."},"857":{"dur":2,"text":"- So, you've got the right\npeople, the right places."},"859":{"dur":1,"text":"- You know what?"},"861":{"dur":4,"text":"I have to say that this\nparticular session,"},"865":{"dur":2,"text":"I am very pleased with the committees"},"868":{"dur":2,"text":"and they seem to complement each other,"},"870":{"dur":2,"text":"everybody is working hard."},"872":{"dur":5,"text":"Both the minority and the\nmajority parties seem to fit."},"879":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, I feel very good\nabout the committees"},"882":{"dur":2,"text":"and the committee assignments\nthat we put together"},"885":{"dur":1,"text":"before the session."},"886":{"dur":2,"text":"So that was probably"},"888":{"dur":2,"text":"one of the most important things it did."},"891":{"dur":1,"text":"- You know, it's\ninteresting you mention that"},"892":{"dur":2,"text":"because there really and\nit's early in the session."},"895":{"dur":2,"text":"But so far there hasn't seem to be"},"898":{"dur":3,"text":"any real partisan desk\nstep on the senate floor."},"901":{"dur":3,"text":"- No and I guess we have a philosophy."},"904":{"dur":2,"text":"We want to treat people with respect"},"907":{"dur":5,"text":"and we feel that the minority\nparty has a role to play."},"912":{"dur":1,"text":"We think they need to know"},"914":{"dur":2,"text":"we don't sneak around behind them."},"916":{"dur":2,"text":"We try to let them know what's going on."},"918":{"dur":1,"text":"You know what?"},"920":{"dur":2,"text":"They let us know what's going on too."},"922":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, right now we have a\nreal healthy relationship."},"926":{"dur":3,"text":"Now we know we're gonna\nhave differences of opinion."},"929":{"dur":2,"text":"We had it on the floor today.\n- [Dave] Sure."},"932":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Rich] But we still respect each other."},"933":{"dur":5,"text":"And I think that makes for\ngood solid legislation."},"939":{"dur":1,"text":"- In other words your philosophy is"},"941":{"dur":3,"text":"everybody's got ideas,\nthey're worth hearing."},"944":{"dur":2,"text":"You may not agree but you\ncan do it respectfully."},"946":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Rich] Absolutely."},"948":{"dur":1,"text":"- I wanted to get into one subject"},"950":{"dur":2,"text":"since you brought up other committees."},"953":{"dur":3,"text":"Judiciary has spent an\nentire day

Well Dave, there's a lot of\nbills in on human trafficking"},"971":{"dur":1,"text":"and they're gonna hear them all"},"973":{"dur":1,"text":"and I think they're\ngonna be putting
