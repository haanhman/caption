had suppressed trade."},"662":{"dur":1,"text":"And ask yourself,\nwould it have been a good or bad thing?"},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"First, you have to ask what would have\nhappened to the level of

and"},"4028":{"dur":3,"text":"that you've been overcoming, and you go\nstraight back into fire-fighting mode."},"4032":{"dur":3,"text":"So how do we help these leaders\nactually take the ideas that they get"},"4035":{"dur":3,"text":"passionate about in the classroom and\nimplement them in their organizations?"},"4039":{"dur":5,"text":"And so we have, and this is my pitch\nto you, we have alumni

companies,"},"4054":{"dur":7,"text":"hand in hand working with these leaders\nand helping them really walk that journey."},"4061":{"dur":2,"text":"So really to go down that path and"},"4063":{"dur":2,"text":"learn, what does it mean\nto be an effective leader?"},"4068":{"dur":1,"text":"When is it good to let go and delegate,"},"4070":{"dur":2,"text":"and when do you actually\nhave to intervene?"},"4072":{"dur":4,"text":"Those are incredibly hard things for\nany leader to try to figure out."},"4076":{"dur":4,"text":"And what we do is we try to tap on
