separate,"},"490":{"dur":3,"text":"so driving is now a quite separate subject, so to speak,"},"493":{"dur":3,"text":"from engineering of the car"},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"or learning how to service it."},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"So automation allows this separation"},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"and also allows -- in the case of driving,"},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"and I believe also in the future case of

that."},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's another thing that comes up with basics."},"515":{"dur":2,"text":"People confuse, in my view,"},"517":{"dur":3,"text":"the order of the invention of the tools"},"520":{"dur":3,"text":"with the order in which they should use them for teaching."},"523":{"dur":3,"text":"So just because paper was invented before computers,"},"526":{"dur":3,"text":"it

down,"},"684":{"dur":3,"text":"but that we have dumbed-down problems right now."},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, another issue people bring up"},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"is somehow that hand calculating

can understand how the basics of the system work better."},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"I think there is one thing that I think very valid here,"},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"which is that I think understanding

programming."},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"Programming is how most procedures and processes"},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"get written down these days,"},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's also a great

am suggesting here"},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"is we have a unique opportunity"},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"to make maths both more practical"},"737":{"dur":3,"text":"and more conceptual, simultaneously."},"740":{"dur":3,"text":"I can't think of any other subject where that's recently been possible."},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"It's usually some kind of choice"},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"between the vocational and the intellectual."},"747":{"dur":3,"text":"But I think we can do both at the same time here."},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"And we open up so many more possibilities."},"755":{"dur":2,"text":"You can do so many more problems."},"757":{"dur":2,"text":"What I really think we gain from this"},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"is students getting intuition and

to do."},"777":{"dur":3,"text":"Another thing it allows us to do is reorder the curriculum."},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"Traditionally it's been by how difficult it is to calculate,"},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"but now we can reorder it"},"784":{"dur":2,"text":"by how difficult it is to understand the concepts,"},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"however hard the

that's the problem."},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"But actually many of the concepts"},"799":{"dur":3,"text":"are amenable to a much younger age group."},"802":{"dur":3,"text":"This was an example I built for my daughter."},"805":{"dur":2,"text":"And very, very simple."},"808":{"dur":2,"text":"We were talking about what happens"},"810":{"dur":2,"text":"when you increase the number of sides of a
