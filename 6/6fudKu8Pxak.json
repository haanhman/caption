the slide here,\nwhen you take a quick glance at it,"},"28":{"dur":3,"text":"what you will notice is that\nwomen are underrepresented, and"},"31":{"dur":5,"text":"continue to be underrepresented at the top\nlevels of all sectors of our society."},"37":{"dur":2,"text":"So, the first two bullet points\nshow us the dearth of women in"},"40":{"dur":1,"text":"the corporate sector."},"42":{"dur":1,"text":"If we drop down to the third bullet point,"},"44":{"dur":3,"text":"we see that women make up\nonly 18% of our Congress."},"47":{"dur":2,"text":"And this was after a year which,\nsupposedly,"},"49":{"dur":2,"text":"was just a watershed of\nwomen entering Congress."},"51":{"dur":1,"text":"We're still at only 18% women."},"54":{"dur":4,"text":"University presidencies of our top\nresearch universities, only 17% of women."},"59":{"dur":2,"text":"And as low as these numbers are,\nif we were to drill down and"},"62":{"dur":2,"text":"look at women of color,\nthey're considerably lower."},"64":{"dur":3,"text":"Now this is actually really quite\nsurprising in one way, and that is,"},"68":{"dur":3,"text":"it's been over 30 years now since\nwomen started outnumbering men and"},"72":{"dur":2,"text":"they're earning a bachelor's degree."},"74":{"dur":4,"text":"So any of you who are here\nfrom the class of 1980 or"},"79":{"dur":3,"text":"1985,

time."},"103":{"dur":3,"text":"But here we are 30 years\nlater with these numbers."},"106":{"dur":1,"text":"And when I think about why\nthis is a problem, and"},"108":{"dur":3,"text":"maybe that seems obvious to people who\ncome to a talk on women's leadership."},"111":{"dur":3,"text":"But I want to point out that in addition\nto this being a problem for women,"},"115":{"dur":2,"text":"there's a societal cost to this."},"118":{"dur":3,"text":"We have to ask ourselves,\nwhat important questions and"},"121":{"dur":4,"text":"problems aren't being solved by our\ncompanies, our governments, and"},"125":{"dur":4,"text":"our universities if women's voices\naren't being more fully included?"},"129":{"dur":4,"text":"Or to flip that around to be positive\nabout it, think about what we could be"},"133":{"dur":4,"text":"doing in our governments, in our\nuniversities, and in our companies if we"},"138":{"dur":4,"text":"were more fully drawing on all the talent\nthat women bring to our society."},"142":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's what I want to\ntalk about with you today."},"144":{"dur":2,"text":"Clearly these numbers are low for\nall kinds of reasons."},"147":{"dur":3,"text":"I teach a class, one of the freshmen\nThinking Matters class, on this topic and"},"150":{"dur":2,"text":"we spend the entire quarter talking\nabout all these reasons and"},"152":{"dur":1,"text":"how to get beyond this."},"153":{"dur":3,"text":"Today I want to highlight just one barrier\nto you that I think is really important."},"157":{"dur":5,"text":"And that is, I want to draw out the way\nthat stereotypes about gender and"},"162":{"dur":5,"text":"work lead to a bias in terms of how\nwomen are evaluated in the workplace."},"167":{"dur":3,"text":"And so what I'm going to do is spend some\ntime describing that problem to you and"},"171":{"dur":4,"text":"showing you that it's more consequential\nthan perhaps we might think."},"175":{"dur":4,"text":"And then I'm going to turn it over to\nLori Mackenzie, who's going to talk about"},"179":{"dur":3,"text":"some of the tools that we've been\ndeveloping to move beyond that bias."},"183":{"dur":3,"text":"And to create workplaces that more fully\nembrace the talent of women and men."},"188":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I want to just start off with a\nresearch study that you may have heard of,"},"192":{"dur":1,"text":"that got a lot attention\nwhen it came out and"},"194":{"dur":3,"text":"really illustrates the kind of things\nthat I want to share with you today."},"198":{"dur":4,"text":"And as this picture shows here, the\ncontext of this study is orchestras and"},"202":{"dur":2,"text":"the hiring of musicians into orchestras."},"205":{"dur":2,"text":"So in the 70s and\n80s in the United States,"},"207":{"dur":3,"text":"women made up only 5% of\nall orchestra musicians."},"211":{"dur":1,"text":"So this was a really male type space."},"213":{"dur":2,"text":"And we do a lot of work at the Clayman\nInstitute in tech, and I think about this."},"216":{"dur":3,"text":"And this was more male type\nthan tech is today, okay."},"219":{"dur":4,"text":"And so the major orchestras around the\ncountry became concerned that perhaps one"},"224":{"dur":1,"text":"of the reasons they were so"},"226":{"dur":4,"text":"few women is that there was a bias\nagainst women in the audition process."},"230":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think about that in the 70s and\n80s, somebody making that suggestion,"},"233":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm sure they were lots of people that\nthought that that seemed ridiculous and"},"237":{"dur":2,"text":"doubted that that was the right answer."},"239":{"dur":4,"text":"But to these orchestras' credit, what they\ndid, rather than just debating whether or"},"243":{"dur":3,"text":"not this was the case, they decided\nto do an experiment and find out."},"247":{"dur":2,"text":"We're always trying to urge the companies\nwe work with to do an experiment."},"250":{"dur":4,"text":"Let's see, so what they did is they\nintroduced a screen between the musician"},"254":{"dur":2,"text":"auditioning and\nthe panel of judges, okay, so"},"257":{"dur":4,"text":"that the panel of judges could no longer\ntell if the musician was a male or female."},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"Now to make it a really good experiment,\nthey found out they also needed to put"},"264":{"dur":2,"text":"carpet down on the floors because\nheel clicks were giving it away."},"267":{"dur":2,"text":"So you want to to make it a really\nnice experiment you couldn't tell"},"270":{"dur":1,"text":"who this person was."},"271":{"dur":2,"text":"And what they found was rather dramatic."},"273":{"dur":3,"text":"That is the introduction of the screen\nincreased the odds that a woman would make"},"277":{"dur":3,"text":"it past this first round\nof auditions by a full 50%."},"281":{"dur":2,"text":"So it made a really big difference."},"284":{"dur":1,"text":"If you fast forward to today,"},"285":{"dur":4,"text":"women make up 25% of orchestra\nmusicians in our top orchestras."},"290":{"dur":3,"text":"40% overall,\nstill not at parity in orchestras, but"},"293":{"dur":3,"text":"the screen really did make a difference."},"296":{"dur":2,"text":"I lead off with this example because it\nillustrates the two things I want to talk"},"299":{"dur":0,"text":"about with you today."},"300":{"dur":4,"text":"One is that stereotypes about gender\naffect how women are evaluated."},"304":{"dur":4,"text":"Without this screen, women were not being\nseen as competently as they actually were."},"309":{"dur":1,"text":"And secondly the screen,"},"310":{"dur":4,"text":"there are going to be tools that we can\ndevelop that are going to allow us to"},"315":{"dur":4,"text":"block the negative effects of\nstereotypes on how women are evaluated."},"319":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, we're not going to be talking\nabout screens later today,"},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"we're going to have to be more\ncreative than that, right?"},"323":{"dur":3,"text":"But since most of us couldn't live our\nwork lives behind a screen and wouldn't"},"327":{"dur":3,"text":"want to, but we do have some tools I\nthink that can help us get beyond bias."},"331":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's where we want to get to today."},"333":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm going to end up with this\nas my conclusion, okay, and"},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"then we'll work on getting there."},"338":{"dur":4,"text":"I want to first show you how stereotypes\nlimit women's leadership, okay."},"343":{"dur":3,"text":"But all the way through,\nI want to draw up one more thread, and"},"346":{"dur":3,"text":"it's not only that these stereotypes\nare limiting women's leadership,"},"350":{"dur":4,"text":"they're actually interfering with the goal\nof having meritocratic workplaces."},"355":{"dur":3,"text":"Meritocratic workplaces that are essential\nto innovation and discovery."},"359":{"dur":1,"text":"What I mean by that is this."},"361":{"dur":3,"text":"If we want to be as\ninnovative as we can be."},"364":{"dur":3,"text":"And if we want to discover the best\nscientific findings we can find"},"368":{"dur":1,"text":"on our universities and in our companies."},"369":{"dur":5,"text":"It's essential that the best ideas and\nthe best talents rise to the top."},"374":{"dur":3,"text":"And if that's not happening then\nwe're interfering with the goal of"},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"meritocracy in addition to\nlimiting womens' leadership."},"381":{"dur":1,"text":"So, let's talk a little\nbit about how this works."},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"My job is to sort of review\nsome of the social science and"},"385":{"dur":1,"text":"share some really cool studies with you."},"387":{"dur":4,"text":"But, before doing that, I want to talk\na little bit about the word bias itself."},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"Bias is a word that\noften people don't like."},"394":{"dur":4,"text":"It has kind of this ugly connotation to\nit, as if you're calling someone sexist or"},"398":{"dur":1,"text":"racist or something."},"399":{"dur":3,"text":"But that's not how I'm going to\nbe using the term here today."},"403":{"dur":4,"text":"When I talk about bias, it's simply\ngoing to be an error in decision making."},"407":{"dur":4,"text":"So if we think about the orchestras again,\nI think we can safely assume that most,"},"412":{"dur":4,"text":"if not all of those judges wanted\nto hire the best musician possible."},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"They didn't get out of bed in the morning\nto discriminate against women,"},"419":{"dur":1,"text":"that wasn't their goal."},"420":{"dur":1,"text":"They wanted to hire the best\nmusician posssible."},"422":{"dur":4,"text":"But for reasons I'm going to explain,\nonce they saw the gender of the musician,"},"426":{"dur":3,"text":"that affected how they saw that\nperson's ability and skills, okay."},"430":{"dur":3,"text":"What we're going to see here today, is all\nof us are prone to these sorts of biases."},"433":{"dur":3,"text":"They're unconscious biases if you will,\nokay, which is the bad news."},"436":{"dur":2,"text":"But the good news is going to be\nthat there are procedures in place,"},"439":{"dur":3,"text":"that we can put in place,\nthat keep us from acting on these biases."},"443":{"dur":3,"text":"So I always describe this as kind of\na no blame, high responsibility message."},"446":{"dur":4,"text":"So that's bias, what does that tell\nus about how stereotypes work?"},"451":{"dur":3,"text":"So the key idea about stereotypes that\nwe want to talk about today is that"},"455":{"dur":3,"text":"stereotypes function as what we might\nthink of as a cognitive shortcut in"},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"information processing."},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"So let me just talk about\nthe orchestra one last time."},"463":{"dur":3,"text":"Imagine that orchestra is auditioning\nlike 100 musicians for just two or"},"467":{"dur":1,"text":"three openings."},"468":{"dur":3,"text":"And that would not be uncommon\nat a major orchestra."},"471":{"dur":3,"text":"If you're one of those judges, that's\na lot of information to take in, right,"},"474":{"dur":1,"text":"100 different people performing."},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"You're having to keep all\nthat information straight."},"478":{"dur":4,"text":"In those information heavy contexts,\nwe understandably look for"},"482":{"dur":3,"text":"shortcuts to help us process\nall that information."},"485":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's not a bad thing."},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, none of us today, in our jobs,"},"489":{"dur":4,"text":"as busy as we are, could get anything\ndone at work if we didn't have some sort"},"493":{"dur":3,"text":"of shortcuts that we took in\nprocessing that information."},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"But unfortunately,\nstereotypes about gender and"},"500":{"dur":3,"text":"other categories of people function\nas one of those shortcuts."},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"And when they do, they're going to create\nsome, I think, undesirable outcomes."},"508":{"dur":1,"text":"So, how does this work?"},"509":{"dur":4,"text":"This slide here summarizes 30 years\nworth of work on stereotypes, so"},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going through it quickly, 30 years."},"516":{"dur":4,"text":"So what the research shows us about\nstereotypes, is that we instantly,"},"521":{"dur":4,"text":"within milliseconds, sex categorize\nany person we interact with."},"525":{"dur":3,"text":"That is, we take notice whether we think\nthat person is male or female, and"},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"we do it in just milliseconds, okay?"},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"Cannot help doing it."},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"In the United States we do this with race,\nas well."},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"So the things I'm going to talk\nabout with gender, work for"},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"race as well in the United States."},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"In other countries, they have different\nthings that they may instantly"},"542":{"dur":4,"text":"categorize people on, but in all\nknown societies, sex is one of those."},"547":{"dur":1,"text":"Why is that important?"},"548":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, once you put someone in a category,\nor put anything in a category, you"},"553":{"dur":5,"text":"unconsciously, or implicitly expect that\nperson to be something like that category."},"558":{"dur":4,"text":"So, research shows here,\nwith data from over 30 countries,"},"563":{"dur":4,"text":"that what happens when we\ncategorize someone as a man,"},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"is we're more quick to\nassociate him with leadership."},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"All the words that have to do with\nleadership, we can make these quick,"},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"unconscious, mental\nassociations with leadership."},"576":{"dur":4,"text":"Whereas with women instead, we make\nslower associations with leadership, but"},"580":{"dur":4,"text":"quicker associations with things like\nbeing a supporter, a follower and"},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"contributor, but not a leader."},"587":{"dur":4,"text":"What this means, is that for men, we tend\nto expect men to act more like leaders."},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"Psychologists called us agentic."},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"To act active and"},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"capable of getting things dona and\ndecisive, and the way that leaders act."},"599":{"dur":4,"text":"Where we expect women to be warm and\ncommunal, nice, concerned about others."},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"The kind of things we might expect\nof someone who is being supportive."},"605":{"dur":3,"text":"And we certainly don't expect women\nto be dominant and assertive, okay?"},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"We might expect men to be,\nagain, at an unconscious level,"},"612":{"dur":4,"text":"better at male-type tasks like technology,\nand women better at female-type tasks."},"616":{"dur":4,"text":"These stereotypic expectations that\noccur our of awareness are important"},"621":{"dur":4,"text":"because they frame or\nshape how we judge people's performances."},"625":{"dur":3,"text":"Such, the very same performance\nlooks slightly different to us"},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"if it'd been offered by\na man versus a woman."},"631":{"dur":1,"text":"And we saw that in the case\nof the orchestras."},"634":{"dur":3,"text":"The bottom bar, the problem with this\nthen, when we're thinking about the world"},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"of work and\nhow people might advance into leadership."},"640":{"dur":6,"text":"These quick associations effect how\nwe evaluate people in the workplace."},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"Whether when we're hiring people,\nthinking about promoting people,"},"649":{"dur":0,"text":"who to put on projects."},"650":{"dur":3,"text":"It effects the kind of opportunities\nwe give to people in the work place."},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"And it effects the amount\nof influence people have."},"656":{"dur":3,"text":"When someone make a suggestion,\ndoes it sound like a good idea, okay?"},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"Does it sound like something\nworth funding, okay?"},"663":{"dur":4,"text":"I want to talk to you today about a couple\nof ways that these stereotypes work, and"},"667":{"dur":4,"text":"show you some examples, and then we'll\nturn to the important ending point that"},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"we want to get to today,\nhow do we block these effects?"},"674":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, so\nthe first way that way stereotypes work,"},"677":{"dur":3,"text":"is they shift the standard\nthat we use to judge people."},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"So it turns out our standards\nshift around a little bit,"},"683":{"dur":3,"text":"depending on if we're evaluating\na man versus a woman."},"686":{"dur":1,"text":"Or if we're evaluating,\nin the case of race,"},"688":{"dur":3,"text":"someone who's white\nversus a person of color."},"691":{"dur":4,"text":"If you think about why this would be,\nI'll use gender as an example here."},"696":{"dur":5,"text":"If a woman performs well, and especially\nif it was in a male typed domain,"},"701":{"dur":3,"text":"this runs counter to those\nquick associations we have."},"704":{"dur":5,"text":"So one thing that we tend to do, is to\nmore carefully scrutinize her performance,"},"709":{"dur":3,"text":"and we do this even in a situation\nwhere we're in awe of her."},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"So I've been talking\na lot about Mary Barra,"},"715":{"dur":3,"text":"the CEO of General Motors, Stanford alum."},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"So General Motors announced the new CEO,\nand it was a woman."},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't know about you, but\nthis caught me by surprise, right?"},"727":{"dur":1,"text":"This is the automobile industry."},"729":{"dur":1,"text":"Who would have seen this coming?"},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"So I found myself reading and\nreading about,"},"733":{"dur":3,"text":"how did she get to this point in her life?"},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"If General Motors had announced\nthe new CEO was a man,"},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"I probably would have turned the page and\nread something else."},"741":{"dur":1,"text":"It wouldn't have been news to me."},"743":{"dur":5,"text":"But that extra scrutiny can, under certain\ncircumstances, open the door to bias."},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"So let me give you a couple\nof examples of this."},"750":{"dur":4,"text":"I want to start with an example that\ncomes from the field of psychology."},"754":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is an experiment where what the\nauthors of this study did, is they they"},"758":{"dur":5,"text":"created a resume for a person who had\njust gotten his or her PhD in psychology."},"763":{"dur":3,"text":"So it had some publications on it,\nteaching experience, stuff like that."},"766":{"dur":3,"text":"And they sent it out to psychology\nfaculty all over the United States and"},"770":{"dur":3,"text":"they said, evaluate this person and\nimportantly, tell us whether or not"},"774":{"dur":3,"text":"you think this person would be worthy of a\ntenure track position in your department."},"778":{"dur":1,"text":"The experiment was this."},"780":{"dur":4,"text":"Half the people out there received\na resume with a man's name on it."},"784":{"dur":2,"text":"And the other half of the psychology\nfaculty doing the rating,"},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"received the very same resume,\nexcept with a woman's name on it."},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is a really great way to\nsee whether gender matters, right?"},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"The resume's the same,\nthe only things different is the name."},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"What they found, was again,\nrather striking."},"799":{"dur":4,"text":"79% of the people who got a resume with\na man's name on it said he would be worthy"},"803":{"dur":0,"text":"of hire."},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"Compared to only 49% of people\nwho got the same resume"},"808":{"dur":2,"text":"except with a woman's name on it."},"810":{"dur":1,"text":"And in case you're wondering,"},"811":{"dur":3,"text":"it did not matter whether the person\ndoing the rating was male or female."},"815":{"dur":3,"text":"Male and female raters exhibited\nthe same level of bias."},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"We find this constantly in these studies\nand sometimes this disappoints people."},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"They want women to be\nbetter raters than men."},"824":{"dur":3,"text":"But the issue is, these are stereotypes\nthat we're all kind of commonly aware"},"828":{"dur":3,"text":"of and they're affecting our\njudgments on an unconscious level."},"832":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, in a second phase of the study,\nwhat they did, is they had people evaluate"},"837":{"dur":3,"text":"these same resumes, except now these\npeople are more experienced, okay?"},"841":{"dur":2,"text":"So now we're talking about people you\nmight want to move into leadership."},"843":{"dur":3,"text":"So they have more grants,\nmore publications and the like."},"847":{"dur":2,"text":"And what they found with these\nmore advanced candidates,"},"849":{"dur":4,"text":"is that people wrote four times more doubt\nraising statements on the rating forms for"},"854":{"dur":1,"text":"women compared to men."},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"So I would need to see evidence she\nhad gotten these grants on her own,"},"858":{"dur":0,"text":"for example."},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"Notice that extra scrutiny\nthat's going on there."},"862":{"dur":2,"text":"Or it would be impossible to make\nsuch a judgment without seeing"},"864":{"dur":0,"text":"teaching evaluations."},"866":{"dur":0,"text":"Now if you think about it,"},"867":{"dur":3,"text":"a teaching evaluation and wanting to\nsee people's teaching evaluations"},"870":{"dur":3,"text":"before you hire them as a professor,\nthat's a very legitimate thing, right?"},"874":{"dur":1,"text":"I would hope that we\nwould want to see that."},"876":{"dur":3,"text":"But the criteria is being enforced more\nrigidly for women than it is for men."},"881":{"dur":2,"text":"Now I want to just switch\ngears just slightly and"},"884":{"dur":3,"text":"show you another very similar study\nthat was done in the context of race."},"888":{"dur":4,"text":"We work a lot at the Clayman Institute for\nGender Research on gender issues, but"},"892":{"dur":2,"text":"a lot of the things that we're\ntalking about work similarly for race."},"894":{"dur":3,"text":"So if we're trying to create\nmore inclusive workplaces,"},"897":{"dur":2,"text":"a lot of the take home messages\nhere will be the same."},"900":{"dur":2,"text":"So this study was done in 2014."},"902":{"dur":4,"text":"And what the authors of the study did,\nis they created a legal memo that was"},"906":{"dur":4,"text":"ostensibly written by a third year\nlaw associate named Thomas Meyer,"},"910":{"dur":2,"text":"who had gotten his law degree at NYU."},"913":{"dur":1,"text":"And in the memo what they did,"},"914":{"dur":2,"text":"is they embedded it with\ncertain numbers of errors."},"917":{"dur":1,"text":"So there were some spelling errors."},"918":{"dur":1,"text":"There were some factual errors."},"920":{"dur":2,"text":"And there were some analytical errors."},"922":{"dur":4,"text":"And then they sent it out to law partners\nand asked the law partner to rate the memo"},"927":{"dur":3,"text":"and give the person some\nfeedback on how they were doing."},"930":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, the experiment very similar to\nthe last one, the only difference was that"},"934":{"dur":2,"text":"half the the people were told\nthat Thomas Meyer was white and"},"937":{"dur":2,"text":"the other half were\ntold that he was black."},"939":{"dur":0,"text":"But the memo's the same."},"941":{"dur":4,"text":"And what we find is this, there were three\ntimes more edits and comments written"},"946":{"dur":3,"text":"on the black Thomas Meyer's memo than\ncompared to the white version, okay?"},"950":{"dur":1,"text":"Again, the same memo."},"951":{"dur":2,"text":"And they were twice as\nlikely to find mistakes."},"954":{"dur":3,"text":"So notice again that extra scrutiny\nthat's going on for the person for"},"958":{"dur":3,"text":"whom people probably didn't expect they\nwere going to be as good to start with."},"961":{"dur":1,"text":"They were doing what they\nwere supposed to here, right?"},"963":{"dur":1,"text":"They were supposed to be\nfinding the mistakes."},"965":{"dur":3,"text":"But the person over here was\ngetting kind of a leniency bias."},"968":{"dur":4,"text":"And this is what we see a lot in these\nstudies is this extra scrutiny of women"},"972":{"dur":0,"text":"and people of color."},"973":{"dur":4,"text":"With criteria that's very legitimate\nbeing applied more rigidly to them."},"977":{"dur":2,"text":"This affected how people rates the

it raised people's sense\nof perceived competence."},"1313":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's a good thing."},"1314":{"dur":3,"text":"But for\nwomen it also decrease their

there?"},"1325":{"dur":4,"text":"Well our stereotypes about women are that\nthey should be modest, not dominant or"},"1329":{"dur":1,"text":"So this was a violation\nof a stereotype

okay?"},"1394":{"dur":1,"text":"So if we're trying to\nadvance women's leadership,"},"1396":{"dur":2,"text":"we've got to get past\nthis likability penalty."},"1399":{"dur":2,"text":"I want to show you one more example\nof the way stereotypes work and"},"1402":{"dur":1,"text":"then we'll turn to solutions."},"1403":{"dur":4,"text":"And that is stereotypes also can\nshift around the very criteria"},"1407":{"dur":2,"text":"we use when making decisions about people."},"1410":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'll just show you\nthis particular study."},"1413":{"dur":0,"text":"In this study,"},"1414":{"dur":4,"text":"the context is people are being\nconsidered to be hired as a police chief."},"1418":{"dur":4,"text":"So police chief is a leadership position,\nhead of the police department."},"1423":{"dur":2,"text":"It's also kind of male typed job."},"1425":{"dur":3,"text":"And so what the authors of this study did,\nis they created resumes for"},"1429":{"dur":2,"text":"two candidates for police chief, okay?"},"1431":{"dur":3,"text":"And they created them to\nbe Equivalently qualified,"},"1434":{"dur":4,"text":"except one person had more education that\nwas relevant to being a police chief, and"},"1439":{"dur":2,"text":"the other person had more experience."},"1441":{"dur":2,"text":"So these are kind of two\ncriteria you might care about."},"1444":{"dur":2,"text":"And one person's strong on the one,\nand one's strong on the other."},"1446":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's often when we're making hiring\nand promotion decisions, that's how it is."},"1449":{"dur":3,"text":"Somebody seems better on this hand,\nbut the other's better on that hand."},"1452":{"dur":2,"text":"So in the first phase of the experiment\nthey have no names on the file."},"1455":{"dur":1,"text":"We don't know who's male or"},"1456":{"dur":3,"text":"female or anything else about them\nexcept what they've done on the job."},"1459":{"dur":2,"text":"And what we find is that people\noverwhelmingly prefer the person on"},"1462":{"dur":0,"text":"the left."},"1463":{"dur":3,"text":"And when they're asked to justify their\nchoice, they say, he has more education,"},"1467":{"dur":2,"text":"or this person has more education."},"1469":{"dur":3,"text":"So all this is telling us is that in\nthis population, people are weighting"},"1472":{"dur":3,"text":"the criteria of education more heavily\nthan they're weighting experience."},"1476":{"dur":0,"text":"Okay, so that's all we've learned."},"1478":{"dur":3,"text":"In the next wave of the experiment, what\nthey do is they put names on the files."},"1482":{"dur":3,"text":"They get a different set of raters\nto rate the two applicants, okay."},"1485":{"dur":3,"text":"And now we have the man's name on\nthe file that has more education."},"1489":{"dur":2,"text":"And the woman's name on the file\nthat has more experience."},"1492":{"dur":2,"text":"So what we would expect\nhere is that people,"},"1494":{"dur":3,"text":"based on what we learned in the first\ncondition of the experiment."},"1497":{"dur":3,"text":"We would expect that people would prefer\nthe man, because he has more education,"},"1500":{"dur":3,"text":"and education seems to be the criteria\nthat people were weighting more heavily."},"1503":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's what we find."},"1505":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay, so people prefer the man."},"1506":{"dur":2,"text":"And asked to justify their choice,\nthey said, he has more education."},"1510":{"dur":2,"text":"What gets interesting is\nthis third condition, okay."},"1513":{"dur":1,"text":"Now we grab a different set of raters,\nokay."},"1515":{"dur":3,"text":"And we give them the same two resumes,\nwe just swap the names around."},"1519":{"dur":2,"text":"So now the woman's name is on\nthe file with more education."},"1521":{"dur":1,"text":"And I've seen a couple of\npeople in the room laughing,"},"1523":{"dur":1,"text":"they see where this is going, right."},"1525":{"dur":3,"text":"So what we, if education is\nthe criteria that carries the day."},"1528":{"dur":2,"text":"If it's where we're weighting\nthings more heavily,"},"1530":{"dur":2,"text":"we would expect that the woman\nwould be chosen for the job."},"1533":{"dur":1,"text":"And all the people shaking\ntheir heads are betting no."},"1534":{"dur":3,"text":"It wouldn't make any sense if this was in\nmy slide show if that was what happened."},"1538":{"dur":3,"text":"And instead what happens,\nis they still prefer the man and"},"1542":{"dur":3,"text":"when they justify their choice,\nit's because he has more experience."},"1546":{"dur":1,"text":"So notice what's happened,"},"1547":{"dur":5,"text":"is the criteria has shifted from\neducation to experience to justify"},"1552":{"dur":3,"text":"probably what was people's gut hunch\nthis person was more right for the job."},"1557":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, so we've seen a lot of depressing\nstuff here on Reunion Week on back"},"1560":{"dur":1,"text":"on a sunny day on the farm."},"1562":{"dur":3,"text":"We've seen how stereotypes shift our\ncriteria around, our standards around,"},"1565":{"dur":1,"text":"the likeability pill all this."},"1567":{"dur":5,"text":"Let's end on a positive note, by talking\nhow we can get beyond these effects, okay?"},"1572":{"dur":4,"text":"And what I want to suggest is that our\nsolutions share one thing in common."},"1577":{"dur":4,"text":"And that is they have to break the\ntendency to use stereotypes as a shortcut."},"1581":{"dur":2,"text":"That's what got us into\ntrouble to begin with."},"1583":{"dur":3,"text":"Good, well intentioned people who\nare very busy tried to process"},"1586":{"dur":3,"text":"all the information on their job and\nin an unimplicit or"},"1589":{"dur":3,"text":"unconscious way, stereotypes\nare effecting those judgements."},"1592":{"dur":2,"text":"So, how can we get beyond that?"},"1595":{"dur":2,"text":"We've been doing a lot of\nwork at the Clayman Institute"},"1598":{"dur":3,"text":"on a project that we colloquially\nlike to call See Bias, Block Bias."},"1602":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm working with companies\nin the Silicon Valley and"},"1604":{"dur":4,"text":"beyond, to first help people\nsee bias in their workplace."},"1608":{"dur":3,"text":"Because these biases are unconscious or\nimplicit they're often hard to see."},"1612":{"dur":2,"text":"So what can we do to\nhelp people see bias and"},"1614":{"dur":4,"text":"then what kind of tools can we devise\nto block the use of that bias?"},"1619":{"dur":4,"text":"Well on the seeing bias front one thing\nthat really helps is teaching people about"},"1623":{"dur":1,"text":"how stereotypes work."},"1624":{"dur":2,"text":"Once people understand\nhow stereotypes work."},"1627":{"dur":3,"text":"They tend to be more careful and\nthoughtful in their own decision making."},"1631":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is a good first step."},"1633":{"dur":4,"text":"However, it's not going to take us all\nthat far, and I think we all know why."},"1637":{"dur":3,"text":"That is, any kind of education or\ntraining that you've ever had,"},"1640":{"dur":3,"text":"even if it was really impactful,\nright, it impacts you a lot."},"1644":{"dur":2,"text":"Today, it may be next week,\nand the week after."},"1646":{"dur":1,"text":"It's like a New Year's resolution, right?"},"1648":{"dur":1,"text":"We're good in January."},"1649":{"dur":1,"text":"We're still okay in February."},"1651":{"dur":1,"text":"March comes, it's gone."},"1652":{"dur":2,"text":"These things wear off, and\nI think about this on reunion weekend."},"1654":{"dur":2,"text":"Every time I'm on campus,"},"1657":{"dur":3,"text":"I think about, what if I could remember\nall the stuff I had learned at Stanford?"},"1661":{"dur":0,"text":"I hadn't forgotten any of it."},"1662":{"dur":1,"text":"How smart I would See,\nthese things were away."},"1664":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're going to have to do something\nmore than just educate people."},"1666":{"dur":2,"text":"We're going to have to\nchange the way we work."},"1669":{"dur":2,"text":"So what I want to end with and\nI'm going to turn it over to Laurie."},"1672":{"dur":3,"text":"I want to talk just a little bit about\nwhat organizations can do to get"},"1675":{"dur":0,"text":"beyond bias."},"1676":{"dur":3,"text":"And then Laurie is going to talk about\nwhat we as individuals can do, okay."},"1680":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's how we'll end up today."},"1681":{"dur":2,"text":"So in terms of what organizations can do,"},"1684":{"dur":4,"text":"there's really two broad buckets\nof things that we like to work on."},"1689":{"dur":4,"text":"The first is that we can change\nthe stereotypes about leadership, or more"},"1693":{"dur":5,"text":"generally, change the stereotypes in our\norganization about what success is like."},"1699":{"dur":4,"text":"So in the case of leadership, even though\nwe know that leaders embody a diverse"},"1704":{"dur":3,"text":"array of traits, people's stereotypes\nabout leaders are very narrow."},"1707":{"dur":1,"text":"They're the Steve Jobs of the world."},"1709":{"dur":3,"text":"These born geniuses that drive change, and"},"1713":{"dur":1,"text":"even if they have to step on\npeople it doesn't matter."},"1714":{"dur":1,"text":"We have those stereotypes\nabout leadership, and"},"1716":{"dur":3,"text":"that causes women to not see\nthemselves as being as leader-like."},"1720":{"dur":4,"text":"And it causes people judging women's\nperformances to not see them"},"1724":{"dur":1,"text":"as leaderlike."},"1726":{"dur":3,"text":"The Association of Women in Science\nis an interesting example here."},"1729":{"dur":4,"text":"This is a group of women's groups\nthat are across the 22 professional"},"1734":{"dur":2,"text":"science societies in our country."},"1737":{"dur":3,"text":"So like The American Chemical Society,\nfor example."},"1740":{"dur":3,"text":"And what they noticed is that\nwomen were winning very few"},"1743":{"dur":1,"text":"career achievement awards."},"1744":{"dur":2,"text":"The awards that signal that you're\njust at the pinnacle of your career."},"1747":{"dur":3,"text":"Very few women were getting them even\nthough the pipeline of women was getting"},"1750":{"dur":1,"text":"fuller and fuller."},"1752":{"dur":3,"text":"So what they did in some of\nthe societies was an experiment"},"1756":{"dur":4,"text":"where they changed the words they used and\nthe call for nominations."},"1760":{"dur":2,"text":"And rather than describing the person\nas just being a genius and"},"1763":{"dur":1,"text":"path-breaking, they said,"},"1765":{"dur":5,"text":"please nominate people who have had\nconsiderable achievements in their career."},"1770":{"dur":2,"text":"And that makes sense because these\nwere career achievement awards, right?"},"1772":{"dur":4,"text":"But that language, changing that language,\ncaused many more women to apply for"},"1777":{"dur":4,"text":"the awards and for women to start\nwinning the awards at a higher rate."},"1781":{"dur":4,"text":"So broadening stereotypes about\nleadership and success can be useful."},"1785":{"dur":4,"text":"Secondly, we need to change our evaluation\nprocesses when we're hiring and"},"1789":{"dur":2,"text":"promoting people to block\nthe effects of stereotypes."},"1792":{"dur":3,"text":"And I want to give you just\na few quick examples here."},"1796":{"dur":5,"text":"One is that we need to develop clear\ncriteria before people make evaluations."},"1801":{"dur":3,"text":"That police chief study I told you about,\nthere was one final condition."},"1804":{"dur":3,"text":"And in this condition what they said\nto the new set of writers is this,"},"1808":{"dur":3,"text":"before we show you any applicants\nwrite down what really matters to you."},"1811":{"dur":1,"text":"And guess what,\npeople wrote down education."},"1813":{"dur":4,"text":"And then when they saw women who had more\neducation, they chose them for the job."},"1818":{"dur":3,"text":"There's about two decades worth of\nresearch that shows the clearer"},"1821":{"dur":3,"text":"the criteria, the more likely we\nare to hire and promote women and"},"1825":{"dur":0,"text":"people of color."},"1826":{"dur":2,"text":"When you have clear criteria you\ndon't need the shortcuts that"},"1828":{"dur":1,"text":"stereotypes provide."},"1830":{"dur":4,"text":"Secondly, we need to ensure that the\ncriteria is evenly applied to all people."},"1835":{"dur":1,"text":"So think back to the psychology study."},"1837":{"dur":3,"text":"I would need to see evidence\nof her teaching evaluations."},"1840":{"dur":3,"text":"If you're in a meeting and someone says\nsomething like that, what somebody in"},"1844":{"dur":3,"text":"the room needs to be doing, and\nwe call this person a criteria monitor."},"1847":{"dur":3,"text":"This person needs to be saying if we're\ngoing to consider teaching evaluations,"},"1851":{"dur":2,"text":"why don't we go back and\napply that to everyone."},"1853":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay?\nThat can be very helpful."},"1855":{"dur":3,"text":"Third, we need to increase\naccountability and transparency, okay?"},"1859":{"dur":3,"text":"With accountability people are asked\nto justify their choices

here's the thing about leadership."},"2448":{"dur":3,"text":"When we're asked quickly to decide\nabout someone's leadership,"},"2452":{"dur":4,"text":"we're more likely to associate\nleader with
