wouldn't say musicianship,\nbut a lot of the bands"},"930":{"dur":3,"text":"are working really hard and\nwriting really good songs."},"933":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe it's just more\nmy taste, I think."},"935":{"dur":2,"text":"New York, the sound\nhere or in Brooklyn"},"938":{"dur":3,"text":"is a little more gritty."},"941":{"dur":4,"text":"And in LA there was\na lot of music around"},"946":{"dur":5,"text":"that was a little too\npretty for my taste."},"951":{"dur":3,"text":"So it could just be a\npersonal preference."},"954":{"dur":3,"text":"MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Sure,

Yeah."},"1184":{"dur":2,"text":"KIM TALON: And I'm\nsure all over the world"},"1187":{"dur":3,"text":"there's more women doing\nall kinds of things,"},"1190":{"dur":2,"text":"but that's one

Yeah."},"1237":{"dur":5,"text":"So, it was interesting\nto me as well."},"1242":{"dur":3,"text":"So basically I had\nspoken with this producer"},"1246":{"dur":4,"text":"named John Agnello years\nago about making a record."},"1250":{"dur":1,"text":"But I was still\non the west coast"},"1251":{"dur":2,"text":"and I just couldn't pull it\ntogether to come over here."},"1254":{"dur":1,"text":"But I really wanted\nto work with him."},"1256":{"dur":1,"text":"He's an amazing guy."},"1257":{"dur":7,"text":"And then when I came\nto New York to live,"},"1265":{"dur":2,"text":"I called him and we\ntalked on and off"},"1267":{"dur":1,"text":"about making a record together."},"1269":{"dur":5,"text":"And he was asking me who I\nwanted to use for the record."},"1274":{"dur":3,"text":"And I was kind of at a\nloss, because I'd always"},"1278":{"dur":4,"text":"played with my friends in LA and\nI did not know many musicians"},"1283":{"dur":2,"text":"in New York at all."},"1285":{"dur":4,"text":"So we kind of joked\naround, and the idea"},"1289":{"dur":3,"text":"of using some of the Sonic\nYouth guys was thrown out there."},"1293":{"dur":4,"text":"And John was like, OK,\nwell, give me your demos"},"1297":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'll send them\nover to those guys."},"1300":{"dur":3,"text":"And if you guys only knew\nhow horrible my demos

happened really quickly."},"1341":{"dur":2,"text":"MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Do you\nfind that working with them"},"1343":{"dur":2,"text":"changed the process for you?"},"1346":{"dur":2,"text":"You talked a

Yeah."},"1389":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, a couple things."},"1390":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, first of all, the\nmain difference that"},"1395":{"dur":2,"text":"comes to mind when you\nask that question is we"},"1397":{"dur":1,"text":"didn't use a click\nfor the drums."},"1399":{"dur":1,"text":"And I had always\nrecorded with a click"},"1401":{"dur":3,"text":"because I suppose I didn't\nfeel confident
