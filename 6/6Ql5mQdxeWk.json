at the bottom we have language."},"313":{"dur":11,"text":"So schematic knowledge is our knowledge of the topic that's being talked about, the content of what the person is telling us, and about the process of communication."},"325":{"dur":6,"text":"Contextual information involves the situation, so who is talking and when and where, and"},"332":{"dur":7,"text":"the co-text, the other bits of language that precede and follow what we are currently listening to."},"339":{"dur":6,"text":"And also the visual information that we can use in the physical context."},"346":{"dur":9,"text":"And then at the bottom, in this diagram, we have language, so our knowledge of vocabulary, of grammar and of pronunciation."},"357":{"dur":8,"text":"Now, when we're listening to a foreign language it's probably at the bottom level that we are aware of having deficiencies."},"365":{"dur":6,"text":"So not knowing the words that a speaker is using clearly strikes us as a problem."},"372":{"dur":5,"text":"But it's also true that the same thing applies to us in our first language."},"378":{"dur":7,"text":"So when someone uses a variety of our own language that we're less familiar with we can have difficulty understanding what they said or meant."},"391":{"dur":9,"text":"For example, about a week into my MSc course in 1977, I went into the Clydesdale Bank in Patrick Square,"},"401":{"dur":3,"text":"this is in the days, I think, before we had holes-in-the-wall."},"404":{"dur":7,"text":"So I wrote out a cheque to cash, put it in the trough, and the bank
