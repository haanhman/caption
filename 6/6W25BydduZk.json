we've always thought of\nit as a mini-production."},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"It's curtain up, curtain\ndown, every time you come."},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"From the front desk person\nwho knows your

convince\ninvestors and customers,"},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"this is something you\nshould spend a lot of money"},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"and your valuable time\nin New York City to
