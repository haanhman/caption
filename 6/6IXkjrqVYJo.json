that\nreally functioned effectively"},"177":{"dur":4,"text":"as a game, it needed to have\na certain set of criteria."},"182":{"dur":3,"text":"And they were defined as\nthings like, you

was\nconceived around that"},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"was some kind of\ninteractive device"},"278":{"dur":1,"text":"that allowed you to\nscan your loyalty"},"279":{"dur":1,"text":"card to get a little\nbit of a reward on it,"},"281":{"dur":1,"text":"a little bit of\ninformation, but it then"},"282":{"dur":1,"text":"allowed us to capture\nthe information"},"284":{"dur":2,"text":"that those

initial outcome\nof the project"},"311":{"dur":4,"text":"was not to have those\nprototypes working in that way."},"316":{"dur":1,"text":"The outcome of the\nproject was to work out"},"318":{"dur":3,"text":"how games design can influence\nthe thinking of a company,"},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"and its done that."},"324":{"dur":2,"text":"But the prototypes\nhave given us something"},"326":{"dur":1,"text":"that's much more\nconcrete that we can now"},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"look at into the future\nas to how we can learn"},"330":{"dur":4,"text":"from those as

what might be possible."},"352":{"dur":1,"text":"So let's explore\nsome issues, let's"},"354":{"dur":1,"text":"explore some possibilities."},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think we wanted\nto work on that basis."},"358":{"dur":3,"text":"So we obviously had to work\nwith companies that we knew,"},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"and we knew we could have\nthat conversation with."},"364":{"dur":3,"text":"So what it allowed us to\ndo was to invest properly"},"367":{"dur":3,"text":"in that conversation\nand allow us"},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"to work on developing the\npossibilities that I think"},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"we always knew were there,\nbut actually none of us"},"375":{"dur":3,"text":"would really have the resources\nto actually bring that"},"379":{"dur":1,"text":"together and make that work."},"381":{"dur":4,"text":"Looking to use the technological\nexpertise that exists out there"},"385":{"dur":4,"text":"to inform of how cultural\norganisations actually function"},"390":{"dur":1,"text":"for me is a really\npositive thing to do."},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"So rather than cultural\norganisation saying, actually,"},"394":{"dur":1,"text":"we know we know who we are."},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"We just want the technologists\nto come up and produce"},"399":{"dur":1,"text":"this solution for us."},"400":{"dur":1,"text":"I think there's a\nlot more to be gained"},"401":{"dur":1,"text":"by inviting those people\ninto the mix a little bit"},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"and having a much more\nextensive conversation"},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"about the possibilities."},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"Personally, I found it a\nreally rewarding project."},"410":{"dur":4,"text":"I've really like the\nconversations that we've had"},"414":{"dur":4,"text":"with

opportunity"},"428":{"dur":3,"text":"to sit back and work with\nsome interesting minds"},"431":{"dur":3,"text":"to think about the possibilities\nand the opportunities"},"435":{"dur":3,"text":"for these kinds of developments\nin a building like this"},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"has been really, really\nuseful and beneficial."},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"So for me, that's\nbeen a great part."},"443":{"dur":3,"text":"And to be honest, I'd like to\ndo one of these every year."},"446":{"dur":1,"text":"That would be perfect."},"447":{"dur":3,"text":"So just bring in a new set of\npartners, explore some ideas,"},"451":{"dur":1,"text":"and then start to work\ntowards some prototypes"},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"and actually keep\nbuilding on that."},"454":{"dur":1,"text":"That
