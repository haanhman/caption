could go to,"},"380":{"dur":3,"text":"so this was really a very timely book."},"383":{"dur":3,"text":"I got involved through\nthe back door as it were"},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"because Tom Rimer and Mitsuya Mori"},"389":{"dur":3,"text":"were already talking about\nputting together this book"},"393":{"dur":4,"text":"and Tom asked me to sort\nof get on the bandwagon"},"397":{"dur":3,"text":"and so I did, but it's been about a decade"},"402":{"dur":3,"text":"since we first talked about\nputting this book together"},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"so I'm really happy to see it out now."},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"- I guess one of the interesting\nthings about this book"},"410":{"dur":3,"text":"is that it brings together, I think,"},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"people who have composite skills,"},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"most of us who work on modern"},"417":{"dur":1,"text":"or contemporary Japanese theater"},"418":{"dur":4,"text":"tend to focus on a particular\ngenre or field or era."},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"My own work, for example,\nis largely post-1960s,"},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"and what's extraordinary about this book"},"429":{"dur":4,"text":"is that I think it covers\nso many diverse periods"},"433":{"dur":4,"text":"of the modern, and is really\nquite a representational,"},"438":{"dur":3,"text":"an attempt to represent\na field of modern drama"},"441":{"dur":1,"text":"across 100 years."},"443":{"dur":4,"text":"How have you organized the\nbook and thought about that?"},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"- It's in six sections."},"449":{"dur":3,"text":"There's an introduction\nwritten by Mitsuya Mori"},"453":{"dur":3,"text":"who's the leading\nauthority in Japan on Ibsen"},"457":{"dur":4,"text":"as a matter of fact, and he\nreads and speaks Norwegian"},"461":{"dur":3,"text":"and has translated all of Ibsen's plays"},"464":{"dur":3,"text":"and directed them on the Tokyo stage."},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"He wrote an introduction"},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"and was of course co-editor,"},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"so he did his share of the work"},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"for the other sections as well."},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"The very first section is\nreally setting up the stage,"},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"as it were, for modern drama in Japan,"},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"which doesn't really begin until"},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"the first productions of Ibsen"},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"in the first decade of the 20th century."},"500":{"dur":4,"text":"So in a way modern Japanese\ndrama starts after that period,"},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"in the very late Meiji period,"},"507":{"dur":3,"text":"sort of in the late, say 1910 through 1920"},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"is the period when Japanese playwrights"},"518":{"dur":3,"text":"start to write plays of various kinds."},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"Ibsen wasn't, of course,\nthe only influence."},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"I, my own work has jumped around a lot,"},"529":{"dur":3,"text":"and I published a book a couple years ago"},"533":{"dur":3,"text":"which is an anthology, as\nwell as a kind of a history"},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"of early Japanese drama,"},"538":{"dur":4,"text":"and I looked at this\nperiod from the late 19th,"},"542":{"dur":2,"text":"to the 1920s, 1930s, really,"},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"which was a cardinal turning point"},"550":{"dur":3,"text":"in the creation of modern\ntheater and drama in Japan,"},"554":{"dur":4,"text":"as well as a lot of other modern things."},"558":{"dur":1,"text":"There are other sections"},"559":{"dur":4,"text":"which are roughly laid out historically,"},"563":{"dur":4,"text":"five sections that start\nfrom the early 20th century"},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"and move into the 21st,"},"571":{"dur":3,"text":"and there's a final\nsection on popular drama,"},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"three genres are represented there."},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"Shinpa, which is kind\nof a transitional form"},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"from the early 20th century."},"583":{"dur":3,"text":"Kabuki, which is still being written."},"586":{"dur":3,"text":"There's a play by Mishima, Yukio Mishima,"},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"which is a Kabuki play in that section,"},"593":{"dur":3,"text":"and there's an excerpt\nof one of the sort of"},"598":{"dur":3,"text":"most important works of\nthe Takarazuka theater,"},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"musical theater, all women's theater,"},"604":{"dur":1,"text":"this is The Rose of Versailles,"},"605":{"dur":3,"text":"which is set in revolutionary France."},"610":{"dur":4,"text":"So it really tries to\ncover different genres"},"614":{"dur":4,"text":"and certainly this whole span\nof modern Japanese theater."},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"- You're really covering, I guess,"},"620":{"dur":3,"text":"a kind of realist theater\nright through to absurdist"},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"and avant garde theater traditions"},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"but you've also included, I think,"},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"a sprinkling of women playwrights\nfrom across the decades"},"633":{"dur":3,"text":"and also some very contemporary work"},"637":{"dur":3,"text":"that is, you know, of the moment I think."},"641":{"dur":3,"text":"- We aim for variety for sure, you know."},"647":{"dur":1,"text":"- Let's just turn now, then,"},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"to a discussion of the\nfirst section that we heard,"},"651":{"dur":3,"text":"the first excerpt from the\nplay, Living With Father."},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"This is a play written in 1994,"},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"so it's quite a contemporary play"},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's written by somebody who's"},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"a very popular playwright in Japan,"},"664":{"dur":1,"text":"so that's correct, isn't it?"},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yeah, this is Hisashi Inoue,"},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"he just died a couple of years ago,"},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"but he was at the top of his game"},"673":{"dur":3,"text":"he had been very active\nboth as a playwright"},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"and a novelist since the 1960s."},"681":{"dur":4,"text":"His work is the closest to\nkind of commercial theater"},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"of the sort of art forms, art drama forms"},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"that are in the book,"},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"yet he was influenced by Bertolt Brecht"},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"and I think we'll see\nsome influence of Brecht"},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"in Okada's work as well."},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"But he aimed to be popular"},"705":{"dur":3,"text":"and yet his work is a kind\nof a critical engagement"},"708":{"dur":3,"text":"with Japanese history in various forms."},"712":{"dur":3,"text":"A lot of his works are\nkind of tragic comedies,"},"716":{"dur":3,"text":"and many of them are musicals as well."},"719":{"dur":1,"text":"- We heard tonight I think"},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"a kind of meditation on history."},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"I think a play with a very strong sense"},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"of residual trauma within, I guess,"},"733":{"dur":3,"text":"the Japanese condition\nin the post-war period."},"737":{"dur":3,"text":"Is that something that he's\nconcentrated on in his work"},"741":{"dur":1,"text":"across a range of plays, or--"},"742":{"dur":3,"text":"- Very much, I think it's\nparticularly modern history."},"746":{"dur":1,"text":"One of his last works,"},"747":{"dur":3,"text":"called Massacre Rhapsody,\nis a musical drama"},"753":{"dur":3,"text":"on the life and death\nthrough police torture"},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"of the communist writer Kobayashi Takiji,"},"764":{"dur":3,"text":"who I think he was\nmurdered by secret police"},"768":{"dur":2,"text":"in 1930, around that time."},"774":{"dur":4,"text":"So he, his subject certainly\nis modern Japanese history"},"780":{"dur":1,"text":"and he's very,"},"783":{"dur":3,"text":"he was a communist himself, and yeah."},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"- And he writes for a very modern theater,"},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"it's a kind of realist tradition, I think,"},"791":{"dur":1,"text":"that he's writing for--"},"793":{"dur":1,"text":"- I think he comes out of the Shingeki,"},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"so-called new drama background,"},"797":{"dur":3,"text":"so it's basically kind\nof a realist theater"},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's the closest of the three works"},"803":{"dur":1,"text":"that we're looking at"},"804":{"dur":2,"text":"that are sort of straight realist drama."},"807":{"dur":1,"text":"- Mhm, mhm, yeah."},"813":{"dur":1,"text":"He's also a very prolific playwright."},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"I think of the three\nplaywrights we're looking at"},"818":{"dur":1,"text":"he may well be the most prolific,"},"819":{"dur":2,"text":"although Okada's still very young"},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"and he's got a long career\nahead of him I suspect--"},"824":{"dur":0,"text":"- Yeah."},"826":{"dur":1,"text":"You know the Japanese, if anything,"},"828":{"dur":4,"text":"are certainly prolific in\nmany of the different genres"},"832":{"dur":1,"text":"that we look at."},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"These playwrights typically"},"837":{"dur":2,"text":"crank out a play or two a year,"},"839":{"dur":1,"text":"and over the course of a long career,"},"841":{"dur":2,"text":"you think of somebody like\nBetsuyaku Minoru for example,"},"844":{"dur":3,"text":"an absurdist playwright\nwho's not featured tonight."},"847":{"dur":3,"text":"He's written well over 100 plays."},"851":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, they really do crank them out,"},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"and they're often abysmal."},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yeah, not all of them are good,"},"857":{"dur":2,"text":"but we tried to pick the best ones."},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"- Well, I hope you picked\nthe best ones here."},"862":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, we'll take our\nseats again I think."},"865":{"dur":0,"text":"- Sure."},"866":{"dur":1,"text":"- We'll hear the second excerpt,"},"867":{"dur":4,"text":"which is a play called\nThe Attic by Sakate Yoji."},"873":{"dur":3,"text":"We really, I mean he's a\nplaywright who's still alive,"},"876":{"dur":2,"text":"he's still working, he's currently working"},"878":{"dur":3,"text":"at a theater called Za Koenji in Tokyo"},"882":{"dur":3,"text":"a very active playwright\nand occasional director"},"885":{"dur":1,"text":"and he has his company."},"889":{"dur":2,"text":"What can we say about this\npiece, I mean it's very much,"},"892":{"dur":3,"text":"it's almost like, reminds\nme of the horror film Ring"},"895":{"dur":2,"text":"or something--\n- Yeah, yeah."},"898":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, I think you can tell here"},"900":{"dur":4,"text":"it deals with a particular\ncontemporary social issue."},"905":{"dur":2,"text":"The Japanese word for it is hikikomori,"},"908":{"dur":2,"text":"basically shut ins."},"910":{"dur":1,"text":"Not shut ins who are elderly people,"},"912":{"dur":3,"text":"but people, younger,\ngenerally, younger people."},"917":{"dur":3,"text":"Mostly men, there are a few who are women,"},"920":{"dur":4,"text":"who retreat almost completely\nfrom the outside world"},"926":{"dur":3,"text":"and of course they need\nto be supported somehow,"},"929":{"dur":2,"text":"usually by their parents, their mothers"},"932":{"dur":3,"text":"who provide the food and other sort of,"},"938":{"dur":3,"text":"needs for them, but\nthey live in their rooms"},"942":{"dur":3,"text":"and do not associate\nwith the outside world."},"948":{"dur":2,"text":"The play is called The Attic"},"950":{"dur":3,"text":"and for any of you who have seen this play"},"954":{"dur":2,"text":"it's a very interesting staging"},"956":{"dur":3,"text":"with a kind of garret\nshaped set on the stage,"},"964":{"dur":3,"text":"very cramped, and in a way is a kind of"},"967":{"dur":3,"text":"expressive of the cramped, claustrophobic"},"971":{"dur":2,"text":"or maybe even agoraphobic nature"},"974":{"dur":3,"text":"of contemporary urban society in Japan,"},"978":{"dur":2,"text":"and the kind of social pressures"},"982":{"dur":1,"text":"that people feel"},"984":{"dur":4,"text":"and this sense of wanting\nto crawl into a small space"},"989":{"dur":1,"text":"and shut out the world."},"991":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, it's a series of vignettes,"},"993":{"dur":1,"text":"so each little episode"},"996":{"dur":2,"text":"has a different cast of characters"},"998":{"dur":2,"text":"and sometimes even a different situation,"},"1001":{"dur":2,"text":"sometimes the attic is an elevator,"},"1004":{"dur":3,"text":"sometimes the attic is\nactually a mountain hut"},"1007":{"dur":2,"text":"and these mountain climbers are trying to"},"1009":{"dur":2,"text":"seek shelter inside it,"},"1011":{"dur":2,"text":"so every five to 10 minutes"},"1015":{"dur":2,"text":"the scene keeps changing in a way"},"1018":{"dur":2,"text":"but it is literally framed"},"1020":{"dur":3,"text":"in this cramped little space on stage."},"1023":{"dur":4,"text":"- Sakate has a long history\nof writing plays about,"},"1027":{"dur":2,"text":"I guess social questions\nand social problems,"},"1030":{"dur":2,"text":"so he's really dealing\nwith the kind of personal"},"1032":{"dur":3,"text":"in relation to contemporary\nJapanese society."},"1037":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah."},"1038":{"dur":4,"text":"He's coming out of the '60s\nbackground in many respects."},"1043":{"dur":4,"text":"He studied with another\nplaywright and director"},"1047":{"dur":4,"text":"by the name of Yamazaki\nTetsu who had himself"},"1051":{"dur":2,"text":"worked with one of the sort of"},"1054":{"dur":4,"text":"great culture figures\nof the 1960s, Kara Juro,"},"1058":{"dur":3,"text":"a actor, director, and playwright,"},"1062":{"dur":3,"text":"and Sakate got his\nstart in the early 1980s"},"1070":{"dur":4,"text":"with his own company called\nPhosphorescent Troupe in English"},"1075":{"dur":3,"text":"and has been very active since the 1980s"},"1079":{"dur":4,"text":"in writing very kind of\ntopical and politically charged"},"1085":{"dur":2,"text":"works of one

with,"},"1095":{"dur":3,"text":"but here I think it's\ndarker and more absurdist"},"1101":{"dur":2,"text":"than Hisashi's drama tragedy."},"1103":{"dur":3,"text":"- Yeah, his plays I think sometimes"},"1107":{"dur":2,"text":"can be compared to people like Abe Kobo"},"1109":{"dur":2,"text":"in that they're a very absurdist,"},"1111":{"dur":2,"text":"almost existential approach to language,"},"1114":{"dur":2,"text":"but on the other hand\nsome of his other plays"},"1116":{"dur":4,"text":"have been more social-realist\nor even in a kind of"},"1121":{"dur":1,"text":"documentary

doing."},"1128":{"dur":3,"text":"Where he takes something\nlike, for example,"},"1131":{"dur":1,"text":"American bases in Okinawa and he,"},"1133":{"dur":1,"text":"you know, does a play on
