much."},"235":{"dur":6,"text":"[audience applause]"},"244":{"dur":2,"text":"Thank you for the opportunity\nto provide"},"247":{"dur":3,"text":"a presentation to you tonight,\non what is, for Shell,"},"250":{"dur":3,"text":"the largest decommissioning project\nthat Shell has ever undertaken,"},"253":{"dur":3,"text":"and, as Stephen said, amongst\nthe largest in the North Sea."},"257":{"dur":1,"text":"As I joined the project\nthree years ago,"},"258":{"dur":4,"text":"the parallels between Brent\nDecommissioning and the Olympic Games"},"263":{"dur":4,"text":"were increasingly evident, the longer\nI stayed in the project team."},"267":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll tell you what they are at\nthe end of the lecture,"},"270":{"dur":2,"text":"and keep you on a knife edge."},"272":{"dur":3,"text":"This is a large and complex\ndecommissioning project."},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"It's large and complex\nfor a number of reasons."},"277":{"dur":3,"text":"Firstly, the location of the\nplatforms, in the northern North Sea."},"281":{"dur":3,"text":"Difficult to get to, and once you're\nthere, actually you're constrained,"},"284":{"dur":1,"text":"particularly for overside work,"},"285":{"dur":4,"text":"by a narrow weather window\nto operate in."},"289":{"dur":3,"text":"It's also complex because, unlike\nmany decommissioning projects"},"292":{"dur":3,"text":"which you're required to work on\none platform at a time,"},"296":{"dur":2,"text":"we've been asked to submit one\ndecommissioning programme"},"298":{"dur":1,"text":"for all four platforms."},"299":{"dur":1,"text":"But it's not just all four platforms."},"301":{"dur":6,"text":"It's all four platforms, 154 wells,\n28 pipelines, two subsea locations."},"308":{"dur":2,"text":"And those four platforms are of\nthree different designs."},"310":{"dur":1,"text":"So you can see from the slide here,"},"312":{"dur":3,"text":"three of the platforms are\ngravity base structures, or GBS,"},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"and one is a more traditional\nsteel jacket."},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"The fact that there's three different\ndesigns and four platforms"},"321":{"dur":3,"text":"means effectively each platform\nneeds to be looked at individually."},"324":{"dur":2,"text":"The complexity is also added to\nthe fact that the platforms are at"},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"a slightly different stage\nof their end of field life."},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can see here that Brent Alpha,"},"332":{"dur":1,"text":"Bravo and Delta have ceased\nproduction,"},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"but Brent Charlie continues\nto produce."},"337":{"dur":2,"text":"I flew off on Brent Charlie\na fortnight ago,"},"339":{"dur":4,"text":"and the size and complexity really\nhit home on that flight out."},"343":{"dur":4,"text":"An hour flight north of Shetland\non a helicopter,"},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"you start to over fly Brent Alpha\nfirst of all."},"350":{"dur":4,"text":"And at the time it had the second\nlargest semi-submersible crane vessel"},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"just off the platform,\nin fact, dwarfing the platform"},"357":{"dur":3,"text":"conducting a change out of the crane\non the platform"},"361":{"dur":1,"text":"and removing the production module,"},"362":{"dur":3,"text":"ready to start\nthe reservoir isolation campaign."},"366":{"dur":3,"text":"We then flew over Brent Bravo,\nand it was conducting at the time"},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"a very successful plug and make safe\ncampaign,"},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"again isolating that reservoir."},"374":{"dur":3,"text":"And then we landed on Brent Charlie,\nstill a producing platform,"},"378":{"dur":2,"text":"but starting to focus on\nwhat it needs to do"},"381":{"dur":3,"text":"to get the platform ready for\nefficient decommissioning."},"384":{"dur":4,"text":"And on the horizon,\njust within eyeshot, is Brent Delta,"},"388":{"dur":4,"text":"which at the time is going through\nthe process of preparing itself"},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"for that lift that you saw\nin the film,"},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"and also conducting\nthe attic oil recovery."},"398":{"dur":3,"text":"So all four platforms are actually\na hive of activity"},"402":{"dur":3,"text":"and are at maximum capacity\nand have been for a number of years."},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"So there is real complexity here."},"408":{"dur":1,"text":"But it also provides an opportunity."},"409":{"dur":3,"text":"The opportunity is to learn,\nas we move between the platforms,"},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"and become better and more efficient,"},"414":{"dur":3,"text":"as we move off Brent Delta,\nwhich is the first to be lifted,"},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"and then on to Bravo, Alpha\nand in time, Brent Charlie."},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"And because it is so large\nand complex,"},"424":{"dur":4,"text":"it's one of the reasons we've spent\nsuch a long time externally engaging"},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"with stakeholders to understand\ntheir views."},"431":{"dur":3,"text":"And we've engaged with over\n180 organisations,"},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"and over 300 one-to-one engagements\nhave been conducted."},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"I've travelled the length and breadth\nof the country"},"441":{"dur":1,"text":"to conduct these\none-to-one engagements,"},"442":{"dur":3,"text":"to understand what the views of\nstakeholders are,"},"446":{"dur":4,"text":"to allow us to explain what we are\ndoing, what we plan to do,"},"451":{"dur":5,"text":"and gain their insight and understand\ntheir concerns as we move forward."},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"We've also conducted,\nas you can see here,"},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"14 wider stakeholder events."},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"We've had all the stakeholders\nin one room,"},"464":{"dur":3,"text":"explained what we're currently doing\nand what we plan to do, and again,"},"467":{"dur":3,"text":"let them listen to the views of\nthe other stakeholders in that room."},"471":{"dur":3,"text":"Because, of course, each stakeholder,\nwhether it's an academic, a quango,"},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"a government organisation,\na fisherman or environmentalist"},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"will all be looking at the project\nthrough their own lens,"},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"and some of those lenses\nare quite different."},"482":{"dur":3,"text":"And, of course, we know that\nthere's unlikely to be one solution"},"486":{"dur":4,"text":"which provides\na one-size-fits-all proposal"},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"which is going to be acceptable\nto all of our stakeholders."},"493":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's finding that middle ground\nwhich is important to us"},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"and that's the importance of\nthese wider stakeholder events."},"499":{"dur":4,"text":"You can see here we've also spoken\nat a number of conferences"},"504":{"dur":3,"text":"to ensure that the lessons that we're\nlearning in Brent Decommissioning"},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"are passed both\nto the other operators,"},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"but also to the supply chain,\nso that others get the benefit"},"512":{"dur":3,"text":"of what we've been doing\nin the Brent project."},"517":{"dur":3,"text":"We divide decommissioning effectively\ninto two components."},"521":{"dur":4,"text":"The top part are those where\nthere is pretty clear guidance"},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"or regulation in place,\nand it's really up to the operator"},"527":{"dur":4,"text":"to conduct the activity as safely\nand as efficiently as possible."},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"So the first part of that\nis to isolate the reservoir"},"535":{"dur":4,"text":"from the surface, and to plug\nand make safe each of the wells."},"539":{"dur":4,"text":"And whilst it's only one small\nelement on this slide,"},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"this is the activity which actually\ntakes up"},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"the vast majority of the time\nin decommissioning terms,"},"548":{"dur":4,"text":"but it also accounts for most of\nthe spend in decommissioning terms."},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"Alistair's going to talk in a bit\nmore detail about the topside removal"},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"but also the attic oil recovery."},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"But the bottom part of the slide are\nthose elements of decommissioning"},"561":{"dur":5,"text":"where the operator has to make\na recommendation to the regulator"},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"through public consultation\nto determine what, on balance,"},"570":{"dur":4,"text":"makes most sense, and what,\non balance, is the recommended option"},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"to push forward for decommissioning."},"576":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's the phase that we're at\nat the moment."},"578":{"dur":4,"text":"So we need to make a recommendation\nfor what to do with"},"582":{"dur":5,"text":"all of the Brent Alpha Jacket,\nwhat to do with the drill cuttings,"},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"what to do with the pipelines\n- there's 28 pipelines -"},"590":{"dur":1,"text":"but also what to do with\nthe gravity base structure,"},"592":{"dur":0,"text":"both the structures themselves,"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"but also the contents\nof those structures."},"596":{"dur":3,"text":"This is a thorough and robust process"},"600":{"dur":4,"text":"where we not only take those five\nfactors given to us by the regulator,"},"605":{"dur":3,"text":"but we've also subdivided these\ninto 12 sub-criteria."},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"You can see here that we work\nour way through a process"},"611":{"dur":3,"text":"of engaging both internally,\nbut also externally,"},"614":{"dur":3,"text":"gauging and guessing the insights\nfrom the best minds in the industry"},"617":{"dur":3,"text":"to allow us to pull together\nall the data which will help make"},"621":{"dur":1,"text":"that recommendation."},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"A key component for us in doing that\nis that Independent Review Group"},"627":{"dur":4,"text":"you can see in the middle right-hand\nelement of the slide here."},"631":{"dur":4,"text":"This Independent Review Group,\nnine eminent scientists and engineers"},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"led by Professor John Shepherd,"},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"provide the scrutiny\nof the science and engineering"},"640":{"dur":2,"text":"which underpins our recommendations,\nto make sure this isn't us"},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"making the science up\nto suit our own ends,"},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"but actually everything we do\ncan be validated"},"648":{"dur":3,"text":"through this independent review group\nprocess."},"652":{"dur":4,"text":"Of the 300 studies that\nwe've conducted for the project,"},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"it's generated thousands of\ncomments from the IRG"},"658":{"dur":3,"text":"which we need to respond to and\nclose out, before we move forward."},"662":{"dur":4,"text":"And this isn't just a data gathering\nexercise of data in and data out."},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"Actually, the other key component\nfor us is"},"669":{"dur":1,"text":"- you can see\nthe second to last slide -"},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"is that engagement with stakeholders\nto understand"},"674":{"dur":3,"text":"whether the output from that\ncomparative assessment process"},"678":{"dur":3,"text":"is that acceptable,\ndoes it meet their needs,"},"681":{"dur":4,"text":"and does it provide the output which\nis likely to be acceptable wider"},"685":{"dur":3,"text":"as we step into public consultation?"},"688":{"dur":3,"text":"So breaking this down into\nthe components of the project,"},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"the first of which is\nthe Brent Alpha Jacket."},"695":{"dur":3,"text":"The Brent Alpha Jacket is\nover 31,000 tonnes."},"699":{"dur":3,"text":"It therefore is a candidate\nfor a derogation,"},"702":{"dur":4,"text":"that is, we can seek an exemption\nfrom the OSPAR convention"},"707":{"dur":3,"text":"which is aiming for a clean seabed."},"712":{"dur":1,"text":"We've done the studies on\nthe Brent Alpha Jacket"},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"to understand whether\nit can be lifted in one piece,"},"716":{"dur":1,"text":"and the answer is, no it can't."},"717":{"dur":3,"text":"So therefore the focus is\nthe second, the deeper component,"},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"the footings which anchor\nthe jacket to the seabed"},"724":{"dur":1,"text":"and how difficult it would be\nto remove that,"},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"and understanding the pros and cons\nassociated"},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"with the removing of those footings."},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can see the footings\nin the photograph,"},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"are the thicker sections\nof the jacket"},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"which anchor the jacket\nto the seabed."},"739":{"dur":3,"text":"And our options are either\nto dig down into the seabed,"},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"excavate and then cut the footings,"},"745":{"dur":3,"text":"or bore through the tops of these\nfootings and do an internal cut."},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"On balance, our comparative\nassessment indicates to us"},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"that, actually, leaving the footings\nin place makes most sense,"},"755":{"dur":3,"text":"when you weigh up\nthe technical difficulty associated"},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"with that cut, and then remove,"},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"the safety impact of the operation\nto conduct that,"},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"and the large cost associated\nwith it,"},"767":{"dur":4,"text":"versus the very small,\nboth environmental and safety impact"},"772":{"dur":0,"text":"of removing it."},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"The second component with\nthe drill cuttings and the pipelines."},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"And the drill cuttings are\nthose shards of rock"},"780":{"dur":4,"text":"which are generated during\nthe drilling phase of the platforms."},"785":{"dur":4,"text":"And pre mid-1990s, these were\nlubricated with an oil-based mud,"},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"post mid-1990s it was\na water-based mud."},"792":{"dur":3,"text":"But regardless, the drill cuttings\nwere discharged overside"},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"of the platform"},"797":{"dur":3,"text":"and have therefore accumulated\nat the base of the platform,"},"800":{"dur":6,"text":"mostly either on the GBS or\nhave fallen down into the fissures"},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"in the GBS itself."},"810":{"dur":1,"text":"The conclusion we've come to,"},"811":{"dur":2,"text":"again, balancing\nall those five options together,"},"813":{"dur":4,"text":"is, on balance, leaving the\ndrill cuttings in place makes sense."},"818":{"dur":3,"text":"The majority of our drill cuttings\nsit underneath"},"821":{"dur":1,"text":"the threshold determined\nby OSPAR."},"823":{"dur":3,"text":"And that threshold indicates\nthe level of hydrocarbon leach rate"},"826":{"dur":3,"text":"which is acceptable."},"829":{"dur":2,"text":"Most of our drill cuttings\nare below that."},"832":{"dur":2,"text":"For those that are above it,\nwe've done a comparative assessment,"},"834":{"dur":3,"text":"which again indicates that leaving\nthe drill cuttings in place"},"837":{"dur":3,"text":"and not disturbing them, actually,\non balance, is the right thing to do."},"841":{"dur":3,"text":"Of the 28 pipelines in the field,\nthese vary in size"},"845":{"dur":6,"text":"from 3 inches up to beyond\n30 inches in diameter."},"851":{"dur":4,"text":"These are either laid on the seabed,\nor buried under the seabed."},"856":{"dur":3,"text":"And each pipeline has been looked at\nindividually to determine"},"859":{"dur":3,"text":"what, on balance,\nis the best option for those,"},"863":{"dur":1,"text":"and there were nine options\nlooked at."},"864":{"dur":3,"text":"I won't talk about those in detail,\nbut we've come to the conclusion that"},"868":{"dur":6,"text":"actually there is a range of proposed\noptions for us to carry forward."},"874":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's carrying forward of both\na qualitative"},"876":{"dur":4,"text":"and a quantitative comparative\nassessment proposal."},"882":{"dur":3,"text":"We're also mindful that\nwe need to delink ourselves"},"886":{"dur":4,"text":"from the export pipeline for those\nnon-Brent platforms upstream of us"},"891":{"dur":3,"text":"that need to maintain\ntheir export pipeline"},"894":{"dur":3,"text":"and allow them to continue\nto export oil and gas."},"898":{"dur":6,"text":"And so there is a separate project\nwhich will do that bypass"},"904":{"dur":4,"text":"and allow the other platforms in\nthe northern North Sea"},"908":{"dur":8,"text":"to continue to extract oil and gas\nand export that to shore."},"917":{"dur":2,"text":"Whilst there are\nover 470 installations"},"920":{"dur":2,"text":"in the UK Continental Shelf,\nto be decommissioned,"},"922":{"dur":3,"text":"a small proportion of those\nare gravity base structures, GBS."},"926":{"dur":4,"text":"You can see here nine operational\nin the UK."},"930":{"dur":1,"text":"And these are very large structures."},"931":{"dur":4,"text":"The legs themselves are\nover 170m high,"},"935":{"dur":2,"text":"over a metre thick of\nreinforced concrete,"},"938":{"dur":4,"text":"over 300,000 tonnes in weight\nfor each of the GBS."},"942":{"dur":4,"text":"This has generated a lot of focus\nfor us to understand"},"947":{"dur":2,"text":"how difficult it would be,\nor how easy it would be,"},"950":{"dur":2,"text":"to refloat these GBS."},"952":{"dur":4,"text":"As a reminder, these platforms were\nput in place in the mid-1970s"},"956":{"dur":3,"text":"with a lifespan of 25 years,\n40 years ago."},"959":{"dur":3,"text":"Refloating them wasn't\na consideration at the time,"},"962":{"dur":1,"text":"so we've spent a lot of effort\nto understand"},"964":{"dur":4,"text":"whether it is technically possible\nto do that, and the conclusion is"},"968":{"dur":2,"text":"whilst it may be technically possible\nto refloat them,"},"971":{"dur":3,"text":"actually the technical complexity\nassociated with that,"},"974":{"dur":2,"text":"the very high safety risk\nassociated with that,"},"977":{"dur":2,"text":"the very high cost associated\nwith that,"},"979":{"dur":3,"text":"doesn't outweigh the minimal\nenvironmental impact"},"983":{"dur":2,"text":"of leaving inert concrete and steel\non the seabed"},"986":{"dur":5,"text":"or the very small safety hazard of\nleaving the legs up."},"991":{"dur":4,"text":"We have also done separate studies\non cutting and lifting the legs,"},"996":{"dur":2,"text":"but also conducted engagement\nwith the key stakeholders,"},"998":{"dur":1,"text":"in this respect,\nwhich is the fishermen,"},"999":{"dur":2,"text":"and their preference is\nto leave the legs up."},"1002":{"dur":1,"text":"What you can see, you can avoid."},"1004":{"dur":4,"text":"This is a conclusion other operators\nhave also come to,"},"1009":{"dur":3,"text":"and whilst the proposal is to leave\nthe gravity base structures up"},"1012":{"dur":3,"text":"and the legs in place,\nwe will of course ensure"},"1016":{"dur":3,"text":"that the legs are both marked\non maritime charts,"},"1019":{"dur":2,"text":"marked in the fishermen's\nFishSAFE system,"},"1022":{"dur":3,"text":"but also we have aids to navigations\nwhich will be on the top of the legs"},"1026":{"dur":3,"text":"to ensure that mariners are safe\nat all times."},"1029":{"dur":4,"text":"We have done a separate study\nto understand what the collision risk"},"1033":{"dur":3,"text":"on these platforms is, and it's about\none collision every 10,000 years,"},"1037":{"dur":4,"text":"so well under ALARP, and that\nassessment was made"},"1042":{"dur":2,"text":"on some very conservative\nassumptions."},"1044":{"dur":3,"text":"You can see also on the slide\nthat there is,"},"1047":{"dur":4,"text":"littered around the UK coastline,\na number of other legacy"},"1052":{"dur":3,"text":"- both industrial and military -\nstructures,"},"1055":{"dur":4,"text":"not dissimilar to the legs on Brent."},"1062":{"dur":4,"text":"One of our probably more unique\nelements within Brent decommissioning"},"1067":{"dur":3,"text":"is the contents of the gravity base\nstructures."},"1070":{"dur":5,"text":"You can see here that the structures\nthemselves have 64 cells."},"1075":{"dur":6,"text":"These cells are about 60m high, about\nthe same height as Nelson's Column"},"1081":{"dur":1,"text":"and about 20m in diameter."},"1083":{"dur":1,"text":"And again, much like the legs,"},"1084":{"dur":3,"text":"these are nearly one metre thick\nreinforced concrete."},"1087":{"dur":3,"text":"And the cells were used to store\nand separate the crude oil"},"1090":{"dur":1,"text":"during the production phase,"},"1092":{"dur":1,"text":"and it was during\nthat production phase"},"1093":{"dur":4,"text":"that sediment has effectively\nsettled at the base of the cells."},"1099":{"dur":6,"text":"We know that the cells not only\ncontain attic oil at the top,"},"1106":{"dur":4,"text":"a layer of water and the sediment,\nbut also a ballasting layer of gravel"},"1111":{"dur":5,"text":"which was used to hold the structures\nin place whilst they were positioned."},"1116":{"dur":3,"text":"The key component for us in\nengaging with stakeholders"},"1119":{"dur":3,"text":"is to understand that sediment issue,"},"1123":{"dur":3,"text":"not only understand quantity,\nbut also understand composition."},"1126":{"dur":2,"text":"And we made a commitment\nto stakeholders"},"1129":{"dur":2,"text":"that we would not move forward\nwith this
