level."},"2625":{"dur":2,"text":"And they have their traditional\nidentity management policies"},"2628":{"dur":1,"text":"I can't get into\nall the policies,"},"2630":{"dur":2,"text":"but some of the

actually"},"2638":{"dur":3,"text":"downloaded, or even just\nbrowsing data and having"},"2641":{"dur":2,"text":"cookies on the\ndevice, is all purged"},"2643":{"dur":2,"text":"so that the next
