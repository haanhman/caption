do another piece,"},"2101":{"dur":1,"text":"And so I just kept coming back."},"2102":{"dur":2,"text":"And eventually, after about four\nmonths, what I realized was,"},"2105":{"dur":2,"text":"that was my audition period."},"2107":{"dur":1,"text":"That was my trial."},"2108":{"dur":2,"text":"And then after four months,\nthey offered me a contract."},"2111":{"dur":5,"text":"And then I was there until

it."},"2236":{"dur":3,"text":"If I become aware of that,\nthen I am dead in the water."},"2239":{"dur":5,"text":"Because for me, I just go out\nthere and try to be funny,"},"2244":{"dur":3,"text":"and communicate, and try to hit\nthe jokes, and do the thing."},"2247":{"dur":3,"text":"And my persona is something that\njust has developed organically"},"2251":{"dur":0,"text":"over time."},"2252":{"dur":1,"text":"I think all of that, all\nof the correspondents"},"2254":{"dur":2,"text":"have their very\nspecific persona."},"2256":{"dur":2,"text":"But it comes, hopefully,\nout of an organic process."},"2259":{"dur":3,"text":"And it took a while\nfor it to evolve."},"2262":{"dur":2,"text":"But I don't try to think\nabout it that much."},"2265":{"dur":3,"text":"Because otherwise, it\nwill go away or something."},"2268":{"dur":1,"text":"So I don't worry about it."},"2270":{"dur":1,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: Interesting."},"2271":{"dur":2,"text":"I have many favorites,

primarily\nbecause-- we do interviews"},"2300":{"dur":2,"text":"like that a lot."},"2302":{"dur":2,"text":"And people say crazy\nthings all the time."},"2305":{"dur":2,"text":"I think what happened\nin this instance was,"},"2307":{"dur":5,"text":"here was a GOP guy in\nNorth Carolina saying"},"2313":{"dur":3,"text":"the N-word and other things\non national television"},"2316":{"dur":2,"text":"at the same time as the\nGOP was trying to reach out"},"2318":{"dur":2,"text":"to African American voters\nin that same county."},"2321":{"dur":5,"text":"So what was sad about it\nwas the GOP fired him."},"2326":{"dur":1,"text":"But it almost felt\nlike they fired him"},"2328":{"dur":1,"text":"because they were like, listen."},"2329":{"dur":2,"text":"You're not allowed\nto say that out loud."},"2332":{"dur":3,"text":"We are trying to get\nblack people to vote."},"2336":{"dur":3,"text":"But it was like that."},"2339":{"dur":3,"text":"But anyway, once he got fired,\nthen it became national news."},"2343":{"dur":4,"text":"And Rachel Maddow, and CNN,\neveryone was talking about it."},"2348":{"dur":2,"text":"But that was one of\nthose situations where"},"2350":{"dur":1,"text":"you don't realize the impact."},"2351":{"dur":0,"text":"You never know."},"2352":{"dur":1,"text":"You just basically\ngo in there, and let"},"2353":{"dur":1,"text":"people-- Stephen Colbert, again."},"2355":{"dur":2,"text":"I go back to Stephen Colbert,\nbecause he said to me"},"2358":{"dur":1,"text":"when I first\nstarted at the show."},"2359":{"dur":2,"text":"He said, when you put a\ncamera in someone's face,"},"2361":{"dur":1,"text":"they get a lobotomy."},"2363":{"dur":2,"text":"And you want to take advantage\nof that as much as you can."},"2366":{"dur":2,"text":"And the other thing\nis, use the silence."},"2368":{"dur":4,"text":"When you don't speak, they\nwill continue to speak,"},"2373":{"dur":2,"text":"and they will fill the silence."},"2375":{"dur":4,"text":"And eventually, they will\ndo the thing which I call,"},"2379":{"dur":2,"text":"I fucked the chicken moment."},"2382":{"dur":3,"text":"They will say, I\nfucked the chicken."},"2385":{"dur":3,"text":"And once they say, I fucked the\nchicken, you have your piece."},"2388":{"dur":1,"text":"That's it."},"2389":{"dur":1,"text":"Then you can just be like--\n(MUMBLING) I think we're done."},"2391":{"dur":0,"text":"Oh, we've got everything."},"2392":{"dur":1,"text":"You pretty much\nfucked the chicken?"},"2394":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah, I fucked the chicken."},"2395":{"dur":2,"text":"So sometimes it\ntakes a long time"},"2398":{"dur":1,"text":"to get to the I fucked\nthe chicken moment."},"2399":{"dur":3,"text":"And sometimes, they say, I\nfucked the chicken right away."},"2403":{"dur":2,"text":"But eventually, hopefully,\nif the piece goes well, they"},"2405":{"dur":1,"text":"will say, I fucked the chicken."},"2407":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm just going to see\nhow many times I can say,"},"2409":{"dur":1,"text":"I fucked the chicken."},"2410":{"dur":1,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: Is that\nat all a reference"},"2412":{"dur":2,"text":"to Jon's favorite

it is exactly that."},"2420":{"dur":1,"text":"It is like, when\nthey say that thing"},"2422":{"dur":3,"text":"that they or their lawyers\nwish they had never said"},"2425":{"dur":2,"text":"is when you have the piece."},"2427":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's what happened with\nDon Yelton, where he basically"},"2431":{"dur":4,"text":"started on this whole, oh,\nI'm making fun of Obama."},"2435":{"dur":2,"text":"He had a cartoon of\nObama as a witch doctor,"},"2437":{"dur":2,"text":"and he said he was making\nfun of Obama's white half."},"2440":{"dur":2,"text":"Which first, didn't\neven make any sense."},"2442":{"dur":3,"text":"And so once he\nwent on that roll,"},"2446":{"dur":1,"text":"I knew that I just had\nto stay out of the way."},"2448":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, my job was not to\nencourage or discourage."},"2452":{"dur":2,"text":"It was just to step\nback and let him go."},"2454":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's what happened,\nand sometimes those things"},"2456":{"dur":2,"text":"work out really well."},"2459":{"dur":2,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: Yeah."},"2461":{"dur":1,"text":"So do you have any\npersonal favorites"},"2463":{"dur":1,"text":"that you look back on?"},"2465":{"dur":1,"text":"Clips that you were just--"},"2466":{"dur":1,"text":"AASIF MANDVI: I do."},"2467":{"dur":2,"text":"That one is obviously\na favorite of mine."},"2470":{"dur":3,"text":"I also loved the time\nI asked Governor Rick"},"2473":{"dur":2,"text":"Scott to pee in a cup."},"2475":{"dur":1,"text":"We were doing a\npiece down in Florida"},"2477":{"dur":4,"text":"about mandatory drug testing\nfor people on welfare."},"2487":{"dur":0,"text":"It was a valid piece."},"2488":{"dur":2,"text":"But what was great\nabout it was, Rick

great."},"2495":{"dur":2,"text":"Because what we realized is that\nlike, a lot of these people who"},"2498":{"dur":3,"text":"are advocating this\nlaw, their reasoning"},"2501":{"dur":1,"text":"was that welfare\nis taxpayer money."},"2503":{"dur":1,"text":"And therefore, the\ntaxpayer should"},"2504":{"dur":1,"text":"know where that money is going."},"2506":{"dur":1,"text":"And so these people\nshould be drug tested."},"2507":{"dur":1,"text":"But surprise, surprise."},"2509":{"dur":2,"text":"The people who\nare also lawmakers"},"2511":{"dur":2,"text":"in the state of Florida are\ngetting paid by the taxpayer."},"2514":{"dur":2,"text":"And so why should they not\nbe drug tested, as well?"},"2517":{"dur":1,"text":"So this was our premise\nthat we went in with,"},"2519":{"dur":2,"text":"and we thought we would\ntake it to the highest"},"2521":{"dur":3,"text":"level in Florida, which\nis the governor himself."},"2524":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we interrupted a\npress conference of his"},"2527":{"dur":1,"text":"with about as many\njournalists as there"},"2528":{"dur":2,"text":"are sitting in this\nroom right now,"},"2531":{"dur":4,"text":"and asked him if he would\ngive us a urine sample."},"2535":{"dur":1,"text":"And I had the cup right there."},"2536":{"dur":0,"text":"I said, you can do it right now."},"2537":{"dur":1,"text":"We'll all turn around."},"2538":{"dur":2,"text":"You could just give\nus a quick sample."},"2541":{"dur":1,"text":"And he was not happy about that."},"2546":{"dur":2,"text":"I think at first, he\nwas trying to be polite."},"2549":{"dur":2,"text":"But eventually, he\nwas like, I'm running"},"2551":{"dur":1,"text":"this press conference,\nnot you, OK?"},"2553":{"dur":2,"text":"And so even though he\ngot mad and shut us up,"},"2556":{"dur":1,"text":"we had the moment."},"2557":{"dur":3,"text":"And what was great about it was,\nwhen it aired-- first of all,"},"2561":{"dur":4,"text":"before it aired-- because\nevery media outlet in Florida"},"2565":{"dur":1,"text":"was in that room."},"2567":{"dur":4,"text":"Meanwhile, none of them made a\nsound while I was doing this."},"2572":{"dur":3,"text":"They were just\ngobsmacked and sat there,"},"2575":{"dur":2,"text":"afraid to laugh,\nafraid to do anything."},"2578":{"dur":1,"text":"Because they want to\nget in that room again,"},"2579":{"dur":1,"text":"and I don't give a shit."},"2581":{"dur":4,"text":"So they're all like, we want to\nbe invited to this party again."},"2586":{"dur":2,"text":"We are not going to\nmake fun of the host."},"2589":{"dur":1,"text":"So they all sat there."},"2590":{"dur":4,"text":"But the minute we walked\nout, they came upon us."},"2594":{"dur":2,"text":"And they were literally\nlike, that was amazing."},"2597":{"dur":2,"text":"We wish we could do that."},"2600":{"dur":3,"text":"And then it was in all\nthe Florida newspapers,"},"2604":{"dur":1,"text":"it was on all the local news."},"2605":{"dur":2,"text":"And my parents, who live\nin Tampa, of course,"},"2608":{"dur":2,"text":"my dad calls me."},"2610":{"dur":1,"text":"And he just answered the phone."},"2612":{"dur":1,"text":"He's like, what did you do?"},"2618":{"dur":3,"text":"And he had heard it on the\nradio and on the local news."},"2622":{"dur":3,"text":"And then when the piece aired,\nI realized how much Floridians"},"2625":{"dur":4,"text":"hate Rick Scott, and they\nwere so happy that happened."},"2630":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's one of my\npersonal favorites as well."},"2633":{"dur":1,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: That's hilarious."},"2634":{"dur":0,"text":"OK."},"2635":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, we are at the\ntop of the hour."},"2636":{"dur":0,"text":"Since we
