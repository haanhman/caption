work is\nvery interesting."},"20":{"dur":3,"text":"You focus on genomic medicine\nand precision medicine."},"23":{"dur":2,"text":"Tell me a little bit\nwhy that's so important."},"25":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, I think is\nimportant 'cause it's new."},"27":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a new technology\nthat can give us"},"29":{"dur":2,"text":"a much deeper understanding\nof many diseases"},"32":{"dur":1,"text":"than we had before."},"33":{"dur":1,"text":"Turns out that\nalmost every disease,"},"34":{"dur":2,"text":"when we think about it, has\nsome kind of genetic basis."},"37":{"dur":1,"text":"Usually not entirely\ndetermined by the genes,"},"39":{"dur":1,"text":"environment is a big part."},"40":{"dur":2,"text":"But when we really dig\ndeep, almost every disease"},"42":{"dur":1,"text":"has some genetic basis."},"43":{"dur":2,"text":"And some of the most important\ndiseases that affect children"},"46":{"dur":1,"text":"have a genetic basis."},"48":{"dur":1,"text":"And understanding\nthat better can"},"50":{"dur":2,"text":"allow us to treat the\nchildren better and in a more"},"52":{"dur":1,"text":"sophisticated and precise way."},"54":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's really the essence\nof precision medicine."},"57":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm also really\ninterested in your work"},"59":{"dur":2,"text":"with the Center for Inherited\nCardiovascular Disease"},"62":{"dur":2,"text":"here at Stanford."},"64":{"dur":1,"text":"There you're actually\ntaking genomic medicine"},"66":{"dur":1,"text":"and bringing it\ndirectly to the bedside."},"68":{"dur":2,"text":"Tell me a little bit\nabout your work there."},"70":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah, I think it's exciting."},"71":{"dur":2,"text":"Because inherited\nheart diseases are"},"73":{"dur":3,"text":"ones that of course, can\nresult in serious challenges"},"77":{"dur":1,"text":"for medicine, in\nparticular sudden death."},"79":{"dur":1,"text":"You're talking\nabout diseases where"},"80":{"dur":4,"text":"the genes that are affected\nmutate the ion channels, which"},"85":{"dur":2,"text":"are the electrical\nsignals in the heart,"},"87":{"dur":2,"text":"or the actual underlying\npumping function of the heart"},"89":{"dur":1,"text":"and can cause a\nweak, dilated heart."},"91":{"dur":1,"text":"So they're very\nserious diseases."},"93":{"dur":2,"text":"But yet we understand--\nand increasingly,"},"96":{"dur":1,"text":"day by day as our\ngenetic technology"},"97":{"dur":1,"text":"gets better-- we\nunderstand more and more"},"99":{"dur":2,"text":"about the genetic basis\nof those diseases."},"102":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think what\nthat allows us to do"},"103":{"dur":4,"text":"is actually treat the patients\nbetter and more precisely."},"107":{"dur":1,"text":"And so we are\nactually able to take"},"109":{"dur":1,"text":"exome and genome sequencing."},"110":{"dur":2,"text":"So exome is the 2% of\nthe genome that codes"},"113":{"dur":1,"text":"for the proteins,\nand the proteins"},"114":{"dur":1,"text":"do the work of the cell."},"116":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I think that when we\nunderstand exactly in which way"},"120":{"dur":3,"text":"they're mutated and which way\nthey do not work properly,"},"123":{"dur":2,"text":"that allows us to try to find\ntherapies that are much more"},"125":{"dur":2,"text":"specific and that\ncan help our patients"},"128":{"dur":3,"text":"and that can really bring\nthem to a cure in some cases,"},"131":{"dur":1,"text":"allows us to develop\nnew therapies when we"},"133":{"dur":1,"text":"understand the diseases better."},"135":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's an exciting time."},"136":{"dur":2,"text":"Given this tremendous\npotential and the fact"},"138":{"dur":2,"text":"that genome and exome sequencing\nhas gotten a lot cheaper,"},"141":{"dur":3,"text":"do you think in the future\nit might be as common as say,"},"144":{"dur":2,"text":"When can we see this\nreally infiltrate"},"147":{"dur":1,"text":"your average person's\nmedical care?"},"149":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, that's what we've\nbeen looking forward"},"150":{"dur":0,"text":"to for a few years."},"151":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact, back in\n2009, the first time"},"153":{"dur":2,"text":"we did an interpretation\nof a human genome,"},"156":{"dur":1,"text":"we really had in\nmind the day when"},"157":{"dur":2,"text":"there was a genome in the\nmedical record of every patient"},"160":{"dur":0,"text":"in front of us."},"161":{"dur":1,"text":"We're not there today."},"162":{"dur":2,"text":"But where we are today is\nordering genomes and exomes"},"164":{"dur":2,"text":"for patients with\ngenetic disease."},"166":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's a not insubstantial\npeople group of people."},"169":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact, one in 17 people\nhas a rare disease."},"172":{"dur":1,"text":"Which actually\nmakes rare disease--"},"174":{"dur":0,"text":"It's not so rare."},"175":{"dur":1,"text":"As a category very common."},"176":{"dur":1,"text":"The individual\ndiseases are rare."},"178":{"dur":2,"text":"But collectively, the\nidea of rare disease"},"180":{"dur":2,"text":"affects many, many\npeople in our society."},"183":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that not\ninsubstantial group of people"},"185":{"dur":1,"text":"are the ones currently\nbeing affected."},"187":{"dur":1,"text":"I think we're not that\nfar away from a day"},"189":{"dur":3,"text":"when we can start to use the\ngenome to prescribe medicines"},"192":{"dur":2,"text":"much more individually,\nin a much more tailored"},"194":{"dur":1,"text":"fashion for patients."},"196":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think that's the\npersonalized medicine"},"198":{"dur":1,"text":"that we've maybe heard about."},"199":{"dur":2,"text":"We're already doing some of that\nwith, for example, lung cancer."},"202":{"dur":2,"text":"But do you think that almost all\nmedicine is heading that way?"},"205":{"dur":1,"text":"You'll check with your\ngenome and see which"},"207":{"dur":1,"text":"medicine should be prescribed?"},"208":{"dur":2,"text":"That is the world that we\nhave imagined for ourselves"},"210":{"dur":0,"text":"in the future."},"211":{"dur":2,"text":"And I don't think it's that\nunrealistic in any way."},"213":{"dur":1,"text":"I think it's\ncoming, for certain."},"215":{"dur":1,"text":"I think we get to\nthe point where"},"216":{"dur":2,"text":"every patient in the\nhospital has their genome."},"219":{"dur":2,"text":"And it is incorporated\ninto their medical care,"},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"it's incorporated into\nevery prescribing decision."},"223":{"dur":1,"text":"If a new disease comes,\nthere's immediately"},"225":{"dur":1,"text":"a risk profile for that."},"227":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that's the world\nwe're looking
