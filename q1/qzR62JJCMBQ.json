the way life is, so we've just\nkind of got to get on with it."},"134":{"dur":1,"text":"That's really not how it has to be."},"136":{"dur":3,"text":"So I was about 11 when I went along\nto my first meditation class."},"141":{"dur":3,"text":"And trust me, it had all the stereotypes\nthat you can imagine,"},"144":{"dur":2,"text":"the sitting cross-legged on the floor,"},"147":{"dur":3,"text":"the incense, the herbal tea,\nthe vegetarians, the whole deal,"},"150":{"dur":3,"text":"but my mom was going and I was intrigued,\nso I went along with her."},"154":{"dur":1,"text":"I'd also seen a few kung fu movies,"},"156":{"dur":3,"text":"and secretly I kind of thought\nI might be able to learn how to fly,"},"159":{"dur":2,"text":"but I was very young at the time."},"162":{"dur":3,"text":"Now as I was there, I guess,\nlike a lot of people,"},"165":{"dur":3,"text":"I assumed that it was just\nan aspirin for the mind."},"169":{"dur":1,"text":"You get stressed, you do some meditation."},"171":{"dur":3,"text":"I hadn't really thought that it could be\nsort of preventative in nature,"},"174":{"dur":3,"text":"until I was about 20, when a number\nof things happened in my life"},"178":{"dur":2,"text":"in quite quick succession,"},"181":{"dur":3,"text":"really serious things\nwhich just flipped my life upside down"},"184":{"dur":2,"text":"and all of a sudden\nI was

down,"},"193":{"dur":1,"text":"another one would pop back up again."},"194":{"dur":1,"text":"It was a really very stressful time."},"197":{"dur":3,"text":"I guess we all deal with stress\nin different

support."},"209":{"dur":3,"text":"Some people hit the bottle,\nstart taking medication."},"213":{"dur":2,"text":"My own way of dealing with it\nwas to become a monk."},"216":{"dur":3,"text":"So I quit my degree,\nI headed off to the Himalayas,"},"219":{"dur":2,"text":"I became a monk, and I started\nstudying meditation."},"223":{"dur":4,"text":"People often ask me\nwhat I learned from that time."},"227":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, obviously it changed things."},"229":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's face it, becoming a celibate monk\nis going to change a number of things."},"233":{"dur":2,"text":"But it was more than that."},"236":{"dur":3,"text":"It taught me -- it gave me\na greater appreciation,"},"239":{"dur":3,"text":"an understanding for the present moment."},"243":{"dur":3,"text":"By that I mean not being lost in thought,"},"247":{"dur":1,"text":"not being distracted,"},"249":{"dur":3,"text":"not being overwhelmed\nby difficult emotions,"},"252":{"dur":3,"text":"but instead learning how to be\nin the here and now,"},"256":{"dur":2,"text":"how to be mindful, how to be present."},"259":{"dur":2,"text":"I think the present moment\nis so underrated."},"262":{"dur":1,"text":"It sounds so ordinary,"},"264":{"dur":3,"text":"and yet we spend so little time\nin the present moment"},"268":{"dur":2,"text":"that it's anything but ordinary."},"270":{"dur":3,"text":"There was a research paper that came\nout of Harvard, just recently,"},"274":{"dur":2,"text":"that said on average, our minds\nare lost in thought"},"277":{"dur":2,"text":"almost 47 percent of the time."},"280":{"dur":1,"text":"47 percent."},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"At the same time, this sort\nof constant mind-wandering"},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"is also a direct cause of unhappiness."},"287":{"dur":5,"text":"Now we're not here for that long anyway,"},"292":{"dur":4,"text":"but to spend almost half\nof our life lost in thought"},"297":{"dur":1,"text":"and potentially quite unhappy,"},"299":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't know, it just kind\nof seems tragic, actually,"},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"especially when there's something\nwe can do about it,"},"304":{"dur":3,"text":"when there's a positive,\npractical, achievable,"},"308":{"dur":2,"text":"scientifically proven technique"},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"which allows our mind to be more healthy,"},"313":{"dur":3,"text":"to be more mindful and less distracted."},"317":{"dur":2,"text":"And the beauty of it is that even though"},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"it need only take about 10 minutes a day,"},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"it impacts our entire life."},"326":{"dur":1,"text":"But we need to know how to do it."},"328":{"dur":1,"text":"We need an exercise."},"329":{"dur":3,"text":"We need a framework\nto learn how to be more mindful."},"332":{"dur":1,"text":"That's essentially what meditation is."},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"It's familiarizing ourselves\nwith the present moment."},"337":{"dur":3,"text":"But we also need to know\nhow to approach it in the right way"},"340":{"dur":1,"text":"to get the best from it."},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's what these are for,\nin case you've been wondering,"},"344":{"dur":2,"text":"because most people assume"},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"that meditation\nis all about stopping thoughts,"},"349":{"dur":3,"text":"getting rid of emotions,\nsomehow controlling the mind,"},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"but actually it's quite\ndifferent from that."},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"It's more about stepping back,"},"357":{"dur":2,"text":"sort of seeing the thought clearly,"},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"witnessing it coming and going,\nemotions coming and going"},"363":{"dur":4,"text":"without judgment,\nbut with a relaxed, focused mind."},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"So for example, right now,"},"370":{"dur":2,"text":"if I focus too much on the balls,"},"373":{"dur":3,"text":"then there's no way I can relax\nand talk to you at the same time."},"376":{"dur":2,"text":"Equally, if I relax too much\ntalking to you,"},"378":{"dur":1,"text":"there's no way I can focus on the balls."},"380":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to drop them."},"381":{"dur":2,"text":"Now in life, and in meditation,"},"384":{"dur":3,"text":"there'll be times when the focus\nbecomes a little bit too intense,"},"387":{"dur":3,"text":"and life starts to feel a bit like this."},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a very uncomfortable\nway to live life,"},"393":{"dur":1,"text":"when you get this tight and stressed."},"396":{"dur":3,"text":"At other times, we might take our foot off\nthe gas a little bit too much,"},"399":{"dur":2,"text":"and things just become a sort\nof little bit like this."},"402":{"dur":1,"text":"Of course in meditation --"},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"(Snores)"},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"we're going to end up falling asleep."},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're looking for a balance,\na focused relaxation"},"409":{"dur":3,"text":"where we can allow thoughts to come and go"},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"without all the usual involvement."},"415":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, what usually happens\nwhen we're learning to be mindful"},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"is that we get distracted by a thought."},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's say this is an anxious thought."},"423":{"dur":2,"text":"Everything's going fine,\nand we see the anxious thought."},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Oh, I didn't realize\nI was worried about that.\""},"428":{"dur":1,"text":"You go back to it, repeat it."},"429":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Oh, I am worried."},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"I really am worried.\nWow, there's so much anxiety.\""},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"And before we know it, right,"},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"we're anxious about feeling anxious."},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, this is crazy."},"440":{"dur":3,"text":"We do this all the time,\neven on an everyday level."},"443":{"dur":4,"text":"If you think about the last time\nyou had a wobbly tooth."},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"You know it's wobbly,\nand you know that it hurts."},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"But what do you do every 20, 30 seconds?"},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"(Mumbling)"},"457":{"dur":1,"text":"It does hurt."},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"And we reinforce the storyline, right?"},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"And we just keep telling ourselves,\nand we do it all the time."},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's only in learning\nto watch the mind in this way"},"467":{"dur":3,"text":"that we can start to let go\nof those storylines and patterns of mind."},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"But when you sit down\nand you watch the mind in this way,"},"474":{"dur":1,"text":"you might see many different patterns."},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"You might find a mind\nthat's really restless and --"},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"the whole time."},"480":{"dur":3,"text":"Don't be surprised if you feel\na bit agitated in your body"},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"when you sit down to do nothing\nand your mind feels like that."},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"You might find a mind that's very dull"},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"and boring, and it's just,\nalmost mechanical,"},"492":{"dur":3,"text":"it just seems it's as if you're\ngetting up, going to work,"},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"eat, sleep, get up, work."},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"Or it might just be\nthat one little nagging thought"},"500":{"dur":4,"text":"that just goes round and round your mind."},"505":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, whatever it is,"},"507":{"dur":5,"text":"meditation offers the opportunity,\nthe potential to step back"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"and to get a different perspective,"},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"to see that things aren't always\nas they appear."},"520":{"dur":5,"text":"We can't change every little thing\nthat happens to us in
