really a knowledge base and a movement."},"1612":{"dur":6,"text":"When we look to what C40 is there to provide\nit really is an NGO that is there to support"},"1618":{"dur":5,"text":"cities in their movements towards a decarbonised\nfuture; towards a climate say future."},"1624":{"dur":1,"text":"But what does that mean?"},"1625":{"dur":3,"text":"How do cities actually work with that

about having that common basis."},"1687":{"dur":8,"text":"And so Vancouver access is different facets\nof C40; it is that connection basis."},"1695":{"dur":4,"text":"It's about shared learning, it's about a common\nunderstanding; but then also with the space"},"1700":{"dur":4,"text":"to allow some level of nuance of individual\ncities to get to solutions that are right"},"1705":{"dur":1,"text":"for the local context."},"1706":{"dur":4,"text":"But is also about developing the tools to\nsupport that planning process."},"1711":{"dur":5,"text":"Make sure that

the"},"1728":{"dur":6,"text":"world and then having that coherent movement\nto move forward together as a group and really"},"1735":{"dur":6,"text":"I think that\u2019s where the other aspect of\nC40 provides us a lot of strength; in that"},"1741":{"dur":6,"text":"unfortunately there is still a discourse taking\nplace about the genuine need to act on climate"},"1748":{"dur":5,"text":"and the validity of the need to act on climate;\nand this really plays out in a very political"},"1754":{"dur":1,"text":"fashion."},"1755":{"dur":5,"text":"And so it's easy to take aim at senior

cities."},"1774":{"dur":3,"text":"Vancouver is a small city of 600,000 people."},"1777":{"dur":5,"text":"We\u2019re a very innovative city, we can move\nquickly, but when my mayor goes out there"},"1782":{"dur":5,"text":"he can still be questioned as to why this\nis such a fundamental policy."},"1788":{"dur":7,"text":"And when he can stand beside the likes of\nMayor from Paris and list

change."},"1804":{"dur":6,"text":"So C40 for us really provides political bench\nstrengths; it really gives us the political"},"1810":{"dur":3,"text":"mandate to move forward and not just on a\nlocal basis."},"1813":{"dur":3,"text":"It's not just for us about the local conversation."},"1816":{"dur":7,"text":"Really it's about having cities generate that\ninternational

of that innovation"},"1831":{"dur":4,"text":"to move forward for tackling climate change\nand moving forward."},"1835":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's an integration together of the political\nmovement as

one of them up on here."},"2912":{"dur":4,"text":"If you want to know more about the projects\nthen you can look up on the Climate Kic website."},"2916":{"dur":5,"text":"So the four areas are:
