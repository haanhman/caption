teach."},"605":{"dur":1,"text":"So, I won't charge you."},"607":{"dur":3,"text":"So, remember the time of the framing we didn't\nreally have much in the way of criminal law."},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"All that was really handled\nby the states in terms"},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"of sentencing there really were sort of 2 types."},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"There was public shaming and\nthere was capital punishment."},"619":{"dur":1,"text":"There wasn't a lot in the way of prisons."},"621":{"dur":3,"text":"What prisons did exist were pretty\nsqualid and not professional."},"625":{"dur":6,"text":"It wasn't until the 19th Century that you had a\nnew prison reform movement and that really began"},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"in Pennsylvania spread in the Northeast."},"634":{"dur":3,"text":"Jeremy Bentham [phonetic] was a person\nwho influenced this a lot and it was"},"638":{"dur":5,"text":"about more humane conditions for prisoners\nand more definite sentences separating them"},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"from society, rehabilitating them."},"646":{"dur":4,"text":"So the way it worked for about 150 years was\nCongress very, very broadly would define crimes"},"651":{"dur":6,"text":"and penalties 0 to 5 years, 0 to\n10 years and judges largely left"},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"to their own discretion would decide\nwhat was an appropriate sentence"},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"within those very broad parameters\nwithout much guidance,"},"664":{"dur":2,"text":"without much explanation,\nwith very little oversight."},"666":{"dur":4,"text":"Courts of Appeals rarely got\ninvolved in overturning sentences."},"672":{"dur":6,"text":"So that continued up until about the 1960s\nand the 1960s a guy named Marvin Frankel"},"678":{"dur":3,"text":"who was a judge on my court in the Southern\nDistrict of New York wrote a book that kind"},"682":{"dur":4,"text":"of turned the world on its\near and what he observed was"},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"that criminal sentencing\nwas just sort of a mess."},"689":{"dur":3,"text":"He couldn't believe it, it offended\nhis sense of law and justice"},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"and the last sentence there is worth noting."},"695":{"dur":5,"text":"He said federal sentencing is a non-system\nin which every judge is a law unto himself"},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"or herself and the sentence the defendant\ngets depends on the judge he or she gets."},"705":{"dur":4,"text":"And he was scandalized by this and the best\nexample of this were 2 other judges on my court"},"709":{"dur":3,"text":"at the time a guy named Morris\nLasker, who was a rehabilitativist."},"713":{"dur":1,"text":"He was a progressive judge."},"714":{"dur":1,"text":"His general view was that\npeople shouldn't be going"},"716":{"dur":1,"text":"to jail unless they needed to be incapacitated."},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"Otherwise there were alternatives\nto jail that should be pursued."},"721":{"dur":3,"text":"On the same bench just down\nthe hall was Edmund Palmeri."},"725":{"dur":3,"text":"His view was don't do the\ncrime if you can't do the time?"},"729":{"dur":4,"text":"There was just punishments that go\nwith breaking the social contract"},"734":{"dur":4,"text":"and he generally would put people in for\npretty long sentences and the sentence you got"},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"if you committed the crime in New York\nfederally would turn in many cases"},"742":{"dur":7,"text":"on whether you got Lasker or Palmeri or somebody\nsomewhere else in that spectrum of judges"},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"and that seemed wrong to Frankel."},"753":{"dur":3,"text":"And so Frankel spawned this movement and\nit was a political movement that got legs."},"756":{"dur":4,"text":"Strom Thurmond conservative from South\nCarolina, Ted Kennedy progressive liberal"},"761":{"dur":4,"text":"from the Northeast got together on\nthis legislation for different reasons."},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"Thurmond was concerned about criminal\ncoddling judges in the Northeast."},"769":{"dur":2,"text":"Ted Kennedy was concerned about\nthe fact that it seemed to him"},"771":{"dur":3,"text":"that white collar criminals were getting off\nand that only poor people would go to jail"},"775":{"dur":4,"text":"and they agreed on new legislation supported by\nPresident Reagan as Hank mentioned that resulted"},"780":{"dur":6,"text":"in these new sentencing guidelines and these\nguidelines basically rigidly created a grid"},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"that became the determinative\nfactor in sentencing."},"789":{"dur":3,"text":"And so a judge would basically go to a\nchapter in this guideline's book and depending"},"793":{"dur":4,"text":"on the crime you go to a different chapter\nand make findings about different aspects"},"798":{"dur":4,"text":"of the crime in the case, add points or\nsubtract points and then determine based"},"802":{"dur":4,"text":"on criminal history where on this chart the\nperson fit and then the judge would be free"},"807":{"dur":3,"text":"to sentence within that range\nbut it was a much narrower range,"},"810":{"dur":2,"text":"63 to 78 months; something like that."},"813":{"dur":0,"text":"These were mandatory."},"814":{"dur":3,"text":"Judges couldn't go outside these\nguidelines unless they had very good reason"},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"and they were frequently overturned\nif there wasn't good reason."},"820":{"dur":4,"text":"The drug guidelines were largely\ndetermined by weight as Hank mentioned."},"825":{"dur":5,"text":"Also by whether guns or violence involved,\nalso whether you were a leader or an organizer."},"830":{"dur":3,"text":"And these are the things that\nreally would drive drug sentences."},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, the other thing that\nwould drove drug sentences"},"836":{"dur":1,"text":"as Hank mentioned was mandatory minimums."},"838":{"dur":2,"text":"Around the early 80s, mid 80s\nis when the crack epidemic hit."},"842":{"dur":4,"text":"Congress reacted strongly and basically\ncreated these mandatory minimum sentences based"},"846":{"dur":0,"text":"on the amount of drugs."},"847":{"dur":4,"text":"And it was basically a 10-year mandatory\nminimum for 5 kilos of coke or 50 grams of crack"},"852":{"dur":4,"text":"or 1 kilo of heroin, 5-year mandatory\nminimums for other smaller amounts."},"857":{"dur":1,"text":"Prior felony information."},"858":{"dur":3,"text":"If you had committed a drug crime\nbefore and this was your second time,"},"862":{"dur":1,"text":"it doubled your mandatory minimum."},"863":{"dur":4,"text":"If you were looking at 10, you're now\nlooking at 20 and if you used a gun,"},"868":{"dur":2,"text":"mandatory consecutives on top of that."},"871":{"dur":4,"text":"And the result was that it had\na huge impact on sentences."},"876":{"dur":1,"text":"Now there were always exceptions."},"877":{"dur":2,"text":"If you corporated, you could\nbe sentenced outside"},"879":{"dur":1,"text":"of the guidelines in the mandatory minimums."},"881":{"dur":3,"text":"There's something called a safety\nvalve, which if you couldn't cooperate,"},"885":{"dur":2,"text":"maybe you didn't have enough good information\nbut you had no priors, no violence,"},"888":{"dur":2,"text":"you weren't a leader and you provided\ninformation to the government,"},"891":{"dur":4,"text":"they said not enough for cooperation but\nstill A for effort then you could get out from"},"896":{"dur":5,"text":"under the guidelines and the mandatory minimums,\nbut most of the time the guidelines were king"},"901":{"dur":2,"text":"and the mandatory minimums\ncouldn't be negotiated."},"904":{"dur":1,"text":"The winners were prosecutors."},"905":{"dur":2,"text":"This is Rudy Giuliani, he was\nthe US attorney in New York."},"908":{"dur":3,"text":"The losers were judges who felt like\nthey had been reduced to potted plants"},"912":{"dur":2,"text":"and criminal defense lawyers who\nwondered why they even showed up."},"917":{"dur":5,"text":"But all this changed in 2005 when the Supreme\nCourt handed down the case of US versus Booker,"},"923":{"dur":4,"text":"which overnight basically decided that\nthe guidelines were not mandatory."},"928":{"dur":3,"text":"They violated your constitutional\nright to a jury trial."},"931":{"dur":5,"text":"Ironically since the number of jury trials\nwere less than 5%, but the conclusion was"},"937":{"dur":4,"text":"that guidelines as a mandatory\nphenomena violated the Constitution,"},"941":{"dur":5,"text":"but a different majority on the same court\ndecided that we could make them advisory"},"947":{"dur":2,"text":"and still keep the same regime\nso that's what happened."},"950":{"dur":5,"text":"Under, after Booker basically judges have the\ndiscretion to consider the guidelines don't have"},"955":{"dur":4,"text":"to follow them they have to consider other\nfactors as well including the personal history"},"959":{"dur":4,"text":"of the defendant, the characteristics of the\ndefendant throughout their life, the history"},"963":{"dur":2,"text":"and facts of the crime, the need for deterrence,"},"966":{"dur":2,"text":"the need for incapacitation,\nrehabilitation all of that."},"969":{"dur":4,"text":"Mandatory minimums were unaffected and\nso they still drove the guidelines."},"973":{"dur":2,"text":"There have been some other\nchanges in recent years,"},"976":{"dur":1,"text":"and I'm going to turn it\nover to Professor Osler."},"978":{"dur":4,"text":"The Fair Sentencing Act of 2010\nreduced the crack powder disparity."},"982":{"dur":4,"text":"So it was 50 grams of crack\nis the same as 5 kilos of coke"},"987":{"dur":1,"text":"that was reduced to an 18 to 1 ratio."},"990":{"dur":4,"text":"Another recent phenomena was the amendments to\nthe guidelines last year that lowered the crack,"},"995":{"dur":3,"text":"the drug guidelines a few points."},"998":{"dur":4,"text":"And that has had an impact and then probably\nthe most significant change recently is"},"1003":{"dur":5,"text":"that the attorney general or then attorney\ngeneral Eric Holder adopted a policy whereby the"},"1008":{"dur":5,"text":"prosecutors were not to file mandatory\nminimum indictments unless there were very"},"1013":{"dur":1,"text":"exceptional circumstances."},"1014":{"dur":3,"text":"It was a leader of a big organization,\nthere was violence involved,"},"1018":{"dur":1,"text":"the person had serious criminal history."},"1019":{"dur":6,"text":"Otherwise the prosecutors would exercise\ntheir discretion and not file charges"},"1025":{"dur":2,"text":"that had mandatory minimums\nassociated with them."},"1028":{"dur":1,"text":"So, I think that's where we are now."},"1030":{"dur":3,"text":"Drug sentencing today, so are they too high?"},"1034":{"dur":7,"text":"Well, let's first hear from Professor Osler\nwho really was my RA and we go way back."},"1042":{"dur":0,"text":"So go easy on me."},"1043":{"dur":0,"text":">> Professor Osler: Yeah."},"1045":{"dur":3,"text":"So, you really started out with Jeremy

that is"},"1068":{"dur":6,"text":"that I don't think the maximum sentences,\nthe statutory maximums, are too high."},"1074":{"dur":5,"text":"I think they're about right, and I don't think\nthat no one should get a high drug sentence."},"1080":{"dur":3,"text":"I think that too many people\nget very high drug sentences."},"1085":{"dur":4,"text":"We have very different perspectives on this\nin part because we have different experiences."},"1090":{"dur":2,"text":"Judge Sullivan, as Professor Shea described,"},"1093":{"dur":4,"text":"was the chief of the International Narcotics\nTrafficking Unit
