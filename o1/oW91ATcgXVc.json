things."},"307":{"dur":3,"text":"We talk a little bit about diet,\ntalk a little bit about training,"},"311":{"dur":1,"text":"and then the discipline of the week,"},"312":{"dur":3,"text":"and how that

salon,"},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"Mandy immediately realized\nthat opening a small business"},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"was not unlike training for a marathon,"},"361":{"dur":3,"text":"especially that whole\novercoming adversities piece."},"365":{"dur":3,"text":"When she opened the doors,\nshe had nay-Sayers who were telling her"},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"that she ought to quit\nbecause it will never work."},"371":{"dur":3,"text":"She had bankers that wouldn't loan her\nmoney when she needed it most."},"374":{"dur":3,"text":"She was encountering code enforcement\nofficers that harassed her every week"},"378":{"dur":1,"text":"and worst of all, a lot of times,"},"380":{"dur":4,"text":"she would come in\nto the morning plumbing disaster."},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"How did she get through this?"},"386":{"dur":3,"text":"She took all these setbacks,\nall these to-do lists,"},"389":{"dur":1,"text":"these issues, and these problems,"},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"and broke them down\ninto small weekly tasks,"},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"and wrote them down\nand slowly checked them off."},"395":{"dur":4,"text":"In other words, she was eating\nthe elephant one bite at a time."},"400":{"dur":1,"text":"Just like marathon training."},"403":{"dur":5,"text":"Another discipline we talk about in\nthis course is the power of consistency."},"408":{"dur":4,"text":"In fact, one of the mantras\nof this course is,"},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"\"It's not about doing\nthe occasional big things,"},"415":{"dur":4,"text":"it's about doing\nthe consistent small things.\""},"419":{"dur":4,"text":"Hydrating, eating right, exercising,"},"423":{"dur":4,"text":"not just on the warm days,\nbut on the cold days too,"},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"and not just exercising\non the days you feel like it,"},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"but exercising on the days\nthat you don't feel like it."},"433":{"dur":4,"text":"That's how you achieve the big goals,\nthat's how you go 26.2."},"440":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm reminded of a student that I had\nthis past semester in the class."},"444":{"dur":1,"text":"Her name was Sandy."},"446":{"dur":3,"text":"Sandy was a high school\nguidance counselor."},"450":{"dur":3,"text":"She had hip replacement surgery\nnine years ago."},"454":{"dur":5,"text":"Because of the hip replacement surgery,\nSandy wasn't able to exercise,"},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"she had fallen badly out of shape,\ngained a lot of weight,"},"463":{"dur":4,"text":"but Sandy signed up for the course\nanyway as a form of personal renewal."},"467":{"dur":5,"text":"She wanted to dedicate the marathon\nto her mom, who had recently passed."},"474":{"dur":4,"text":"Sandy was also a realist;\nshe knew that given her health condition,"},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"the 22-week training\nwas going to be difficult,"},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"and finishing the marathon\nin the seven hour cut-off"},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"was going to be a particular challenge."},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"But Sandy persevered,"},"490":{"dur":3,"text":"and you know what she did every Saturday\nfor those long group runs, you guys?"},"494":{"dur":3,"text":"Every Saturday she would come,\nand she would walk two minutes,"},"498":{"dur":6,"text":"and she was jog two minutes,\nand walk two minutes, and jog two minutes."},"506":{"dur":4,"text":"Mile after mile, consistently,"},"511":{"dur":4,"text":"week after week, consistently,"},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"for 22 weeks."},"521":{"dur":4,"text":"Fast-forward 22 weeks on January 17, 2014,"},"525":{"dur":4,"text":"Sandy crossed the finish line\nat the Phoenix Rock-n-Roll Marathon."},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"Guess what her time was?"},"532":{"dur":4,"text":"6 hours and 48 minutes,\n12 minutes under the cut-off."},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"Oh, and by the way,\nwhen she crossed the finish line,"},"540":{"dur":1,"text":"she was 35 pounds lighter"},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"than when she began\nthe course 22 weeks prior."},"548":{"dur":3,"text":"You see guys, it's not\nabout doing the occasional big things,"},"551":{"dur":3,"text":"it's about doing\nthe consistent small things."},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"One of my favorite times\nin this class is about week five."},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"In week five, students are really seeing\nthe benefits of eating right,"},"563":{"dur":4,"text":"hydrating correctly, sleeping right,\nand exercising four days a week."},"567":{"dur":3,"text":"They're taking on\nwhat I would call \"the glow\"."},"571":{"dur":3,"text":"But the best part, at week five\nand throughout the rest of the semester,"},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"is that students are seeing the benefits"},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"on those weekly long runs of setting\na scary goal and reaching a scary goal."},"581":{"dur":3,"text":"So for instance, week one,\nthe goal is run a mile; they run the mile."},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"Week two, it's run two miles;\nthey run two miles."},"587":{"dur":3,"text":"Week three, it's run four miles;\nthey run the four miles."},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"Set a scary goal, run a scary goal."},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"Week after week after week."},"594":{"dur":3,"text":"Guys, this process\nnot only becomes life-affirming,"},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"this becomes habit-forming."},"599":{"dur":4,"text":"Students get used to doing\nand reaching huge goals every week"},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"and doing something\nthat most people will never do."},"607":{"dur":1,"text":"So what happens?"},"608":{"dur":4,"text":"The DVD player up here\nand the self-talk up starts to change."},"612":{"dur":3,"text":"They start saying things like,\n\"You know, if I can run a marathon,"},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"of course I can\nget through that algebra class.\""},"618":{"dur":3,"text":"\"If I can run a marathon, of course\nI can get that college

national\nrunning magazine \"Runner's World\"."},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"But more important than that,"},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"I suspect this course\nhas changed the course"},"650":{"dur":5,"text":"and allowed many young people\nto arrive where they want to arrive,"},"655":{"dur":1,"text":"to which I say to you guys,"},"657":{"dur":4,"text":"every one of you in

you this afternoon"},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"that marathon training,\nyes, marathon training,"},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"can help you by giving you\nthe life skills and the character
