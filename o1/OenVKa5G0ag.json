it on"},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"because it doesn't have to be on a napkin,"},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"but we call it a Napkin\nDrawing because of the fact"},"337":{"dur":1,"text":"that it's something you do in a hurry."},"338":{"dur":1,"text":"You don't have paper necessarily,"},"340":{"dur":1,"text":"and you draw your idea."},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"For example, this is the way I draw."},"344":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm not an artist, but I draw like that,"},"346":{"dur":1,"text":"and then I take it to an artist,"},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"and I have him do this with

there,"},"357":{"dur":3,"text":"so that I can communicate\nthe idea to other people;"},"361":{"dur":3,"text":"but before I communicate\nthe idea to other people,"},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"the step two is you have to Search it."},"366":{"dur":1,"text":"So, you do your napkin drawing,"},"367":{"dur":3,"text":"and you get your idea pretty set,"},"371":{"dur":1,"text":"and then you do a search."},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"I have a secret website, right here,"},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"that people that wanna\nsearch their own ideas"},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"don't have to pay a lawyer $1,500."},"379":{"dur":4,"text":"Go to patents.com\/search\/."},"385":{"dur":1,"text":"When you go there, type in your idea,"},"387":{"dur":1,"text":"and it'll search the world for you."},"388":{"dur":1,"text":"It's what patent lawyers do."},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"This is a secret they don't\nlike that I tell people about;"},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"but I do it because I\nthink it's very important"},"395":{"dur":1,"text":"that if you're working on a new idea,"},"397":{"dur":1,"text":"and you wanna file a patent on it,"},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"or you wanna continue\nraising money for it,"},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"you should know whether\nit's been done before."},"402":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll give you an example."},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"My daughter went to USC."},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"Am I allowed to say that?"},"407":{"dur":1,"text":"My daughter went to USC film school,"},"409":{"dur":1,"text":"and she called me one day and she said,"},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Dad, I got the greatest\nidea in the whole world.\""},"413":{"dur":0,"text":"I said, \"What is it?\""},"414":{"dur":1,"text":"She says, \"I wanna make a lounge

idea."},"420":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Did you check and see if anybody else"},"422":{"dur":1,"text":"\"ever did it before?\""},"423":{"dur":2,"text":"She said, \"Oh, nobody ever did it before.\""},"425":{"dur":1,"text":"So, I Googled it."},"426":{"dur":3,"text":"And for 49.95 you can\nbuy it on Amazon.com,"},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"the exact same idea she came up with."},"432":{"dur":1,"text":"So, I called her back and I said,"},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"\"I found it; it's on Amazon.com."},"436":{"dur":2,"text":"\"You can buy it for 49.95.\""},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"And she said, \"They stole my idea!\""},"440":{"dur":0,"text":"(audience laughing)"},"441":{"dur":0,"text":"\"You just told me about it."},"442":{"dur":1,"text":"\"They must have been\nworking on it for years"},"444":{"dur":1,"text":"\"'cause here it is now."},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"\"It's on Amazon.\""},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"So, you really need to\nsearch out your idea"},"449":{"dur":3,"text":"before you start spending\na lot of time on it."},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"This is how you search an idea."},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"Whatever your idea is,\nget search keywords."},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"Don't say, \"He did this.\""},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"You just go right to the keyword\nof what it is you invented."},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"For example, I've invented\nthings like bubblemakers."},"465":{"dur":4,"text":"So, you write down, \"Bubbles,\nsprinkler, water, maker.\""},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"Whatever the words are,\nkeywords, that's what you search,"},"472":{"dur":1,"text":"and things like that'll come up."},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"And if it's exactly like\nyou're inventing it,"},"476":{"dur":1,"text":"you're wasting your time."},"477":{"dur":3,"text":"If there's nothing like\nit, you should go further."},"480":{"dur":1,"text":"The drawings I was talking about before,"},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"once you have your rough drawings,"},"484":{"dur":1,"text":"you should go to an artist,"},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"and if you don't have\nmoney to pay an artist,"},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"give 'em a percentage of your idea."},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"Tell him, \"If you do the drawing for me,"},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"\"I'll give you a percentage\nof what I get from this,"},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"\"if it's successful.\""},"496":{"dur":1,"text":"And if you have the\nmoney, you pay an artist."},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"An artist will charge\nyou probably $250 to $350"},"501":{"dur":4,"text":"to do a rough sketch or a\nrendering of your napkin drawing."},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"You'll have to explain it\nto 'em, and get it right,"},"508":{"dur":3,"text":"but basically that's what you do."},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"The fourth thing is you research"},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"and you do some development on it."},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"For example, with my Post-It note,"},"516":{"dur":4,"text":"I had a piece of paper,\nI showed it to 3M in 1973"},"521":{"dur":1,"text":"at an invention show."},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"Gave it to the guy, he wrote a note on it,"},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"he put it up on the wall,\nhe touched it like that,"},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"and it fell to the ground."},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"He says, \"This doesn't work.\""},"531":{"dur":0,"text":"And he started to walk away."},"532":{"dur":0,"text":"I said, \"No, no, wait a minute!"},"533":{"dur":1,"text":"\"You have to touch the top of it!\""},"534":{"dur":0,"text":"How silly is that?"},"535":{"dur":1,"text":"Everybody in this room knows how"},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"to use a Post-It note today,"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"but in 1972 when 3M first saw it,"},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"they didn't know you have\nto press the top of it"},"543":{"dur":0,"text":"to stick it."},"544":{"dur":2,"text":"Take a Post-It note now, write\na note, press the middle,"},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"it'll fall on the floor."},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"But everyone knows that a new idea,"},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"if it doesn't work the first time,"},"552":{"dur":1,"text":"people get discouraged."},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"I invented a bubble toy for Fisher-Price."},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"That's my prototype."},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"I came, you might have\nseen these in water shows,"},"564":{"dur":3,"text":"and things like that, but to\nmake it

months, if\nyou don't file your utility,"},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"which is the main patent, it expires."},"632":{"dur":1,"text":"So, you have 12 months\nfrom the date you filed
