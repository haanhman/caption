hour or two,"},"284":{"dur":1,"text":"they sort of back off, they put feed in,"},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"and they seem to sit back\nand come up peg really."},"288":{"dur":1,"text":"So I think my target

working."},"333":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm always trying to\njust experiment a bit,"},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"first hours on river unless you're"},"337":{"dur":2,"text":"on a shedful, it's normally\na

there,"},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"he's gonna have that\npretty soon you think."},"350":{"dur":4,"text":"I'd only give that maybe\na minute and a half."},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"Lot of times in fishing

no!"},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"- But there's a few\nfish there mate I think."},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"But that's a nice\nroach, you'd settle for"},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"catching one of them\nevery

talk me\nthrough your rig before you"},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"ship back out, we can see what\nyou're actually using there."},"429":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, fairly simple rig,

half, two pound and,"},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"you're fishing for small\nfish on this rig or?"},"461":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Scott] This is what I\ncall my catch everything rig."},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, 09 is, it's got a\nstrong line, you'd be surprised,"},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"well people would be surprised,"},"467":{"dur":1,"text":"what you can actually get out on 09."},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, you'll get out,\nwell I've lost one bream."},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"But you know, you'll get a bream,"},"474":{"dur":1,"text":"a big roach, a big perch."},"476":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Matt] So a really versatile length."},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yeah, a couple, number fives elastic,"},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"it's like me all around rig."},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"- Lovely stuff."},"483":{"dur":1,"text":"And then them few\nwrappers'll give a nice"},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"slow falling, that\nlasting for a minute

olivette there."},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"And then what I can do,\nthat's so versatile,"},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"I can group that up into sort of,"},"499":{"dur":1,"text":"if I need more positive droppers,"},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"I can have three, double shot if you like."},"503":{"dur":0,"text":"- Yeah, yeah."},"504":{"dur":1,"text":"- Or I can spread it out even further."},"505":{"dur":1,"text":"Just really really versatile."},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"- That's a great little tip,\nisn't it, rather than having"},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"a few big shots, have\nlots of little shots,"},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"and you can do more with it."},"511":{"dur":0,"text":"- [Scott] Yeah, exactly."},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"- Lovely little river tip there."},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"Go on, let's get back out,\nI wanna see you catch one."},"516":{"dur":1,"text":"- Let's get another one of them big roach."},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"- What's made you fish\nthat far out Scott, today?"},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"Why have you chose to fish\nsorta middle of the river,"},"533":{"dur":1,"text":"just there?"},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"- All I've done, what I\nalways try and do in a river,"},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"is get into where you've\ngot the most flow."},"538":{"dur":0,"text":"- [Matt] Right."},"539":{"dur":1,"text":"- And that's pretty much\nwhere the most flow is,"},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"right down the middle, so 13 meters."},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, if you look in\nfront of you it's sort of,"},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"you know, slack water."},"548":{"dur":3,"text":"Roach particularly, as well as chub,"},"551":{"dur":3,"text":"they're gonna be in that flow."},"554":{"dur":4,"text":"(upbeat music)"},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"- Been going all right so\nfar, we've hooked a bream."},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"This has swam straight into a snag."},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"So, one of them things I'm afraid."},"598":{"dur":3,"text":"That you keep, you know, solid."},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"And we've lost him."},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"It was going all right,\nbut Scott's down there,"},"606":{"dur":1,"text":"it serves me right."},"607":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'm hoping that he's struggling."},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"'Cause I've had three\nbream, a couple of skimmers,"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"and a few eels, so at the\nmoment, it's all good."},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"Here's hoping Scott's got a few small fish"},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"and no big fish at the moment."},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"There you go."},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"Bent hook, never mind."},"624":{"dur":4,"text":"(upbeat music)"},"642":{"dur":3,"text":"- Michael's got off to a\ngreat start on the match."},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"Started on the feeder,\ncaught a few small fish,"},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"and gradually built his peg up."},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"In the second hour he's\nmanaged a couple of"},"651":{"dur":1,"text":"bream on it as well."},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"However, he's now come in\non his eel line on the pole,"},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"and this chap's got a bit\nof a reputation for catching"},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"the long slippery creatures."},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm gonna go and find\nout how he does it now."},"671":{"dur":1,"text":"Mr. Buchwalder, see that you're on your"},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"favorite eel method there."},"675":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, just got a bite now Matt,"},"676":{"dur":1,"text":"it's going, it's going it's going."},"677":{"dur":1,"text":"There we go."},"679":{"dur":1,"text":"One armed."},"681":{"dur":1,"text":"Oh, it's a skimmer."},"683":{"dur":1,"text":"- Thought this were an eel rig!"},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"Not complaining though, are ya?"},"686":{"dur":1,"text":"- Like not to give too\nmuch away, you know me."},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"- [Matt] What have you actually\ncaught in this so far Mike?"},"694":{"dur":3,"text":"- Five or six eels, I think Matt."},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"- [Matt] And now a brasme."},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"- That little bream has\nrolled itself over the line,"},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"look, best way, don't fight."},"712":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Matt] Let's have a look at him mate."},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"- [Michael] He's a pound and a half."},"717":{"dur":1,"text":"- Good weight though,"},"718":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't think Scott's\nhad any of them yet, so--"},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"- Long may that continue."},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"- You're in good stead."},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"What are you actually\nfishing for the eel's with?"},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"- Wanna fish a little\ntiny bit of dendrobaena."},"738":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Matt] Just the head of a worm?"},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"- Just the head of a\nworm, yeah, literally,"},"741":{"dur":1,"text":"half, three quarters of an inch long."},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"Nothing too complicated, nice and easy."},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"- [Matt] You've got quite\na little hook on there."},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"- [Michael] Yeah, size 16 again."},"750":{"dur":1,"text":"- So them ees, they don't have big mouths."},"752":{"dur":1,"text":"- No, if you look at an\neel their mouth is tiny,"},"754":{"dur":1,"text":"so when you get a bite, you\ngotta let it develop and that."},"755":{"dur":3,"text":"But, last thing you want to \ndo with the eel's,\nyou miss four or five bites,"},"758":{"dur":1,"text":"but you hook a fish."},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yeah, yeah, I've noticed\nthat, actually yeah."},"763":{"dur":1,"text":"- We'll try and get you one now."},"764":{"dur":1,"text":"- Come on then."},"772":{"dur":1,"text":"You're just fishing short,\nnearly in the middle of"},"773":{"dur":1,"text":"the river there aren't you?"},"774":{"dur":1,"text":"Is that 13 meters out?"},"776":{"dur":2,"text":"- It's 13 meters yeah,\njust lower it in there."},"778":{"dur":3,"text":"This rig's a little bit lighter\nthan the one I started on."},"783":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Matt] Have you got\nmuch line on the bottom?"},"785":{"dur":1,"text":"I know eels are are notorious for feeding"},"787":{"dur":1,"text":"right on the bottom of\nthe river, aren't they?"},"789":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Michael] I've got about\nthree inches, that's all."},"791":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Matt] Right."},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"- Nothing too much, just three\ninches of line on the bottom."},"794":{"dur":2,"text":"If you fish too much on\nthe bottom you tend to get"},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"them really deep hooks, and\nyou never get any hooks back."},"799":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah."},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"So you've made a change onto the waggler,"},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"and into one straightaway, Scott?"},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yeah well the pole-on went\na bit iffy earlier Matt,"},"815":{"dur":1,"text":"if I'm being honest."},"816":{"dur":3,"text":"Bright sunshine today's\nnot helped I think."},"819":{"dur":3,"text":"Although the water looks."},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"- Nice little dace."},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yeah, the water looks\nreasonably colored,"},"827":{"dur":2,"text":"but it is, it's clearer than you think."},"829":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, so the roach\nthat I was catching,"},"831":{"dur":2,"text":"they backed off little dace."},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"- All little weight builders\nthough mate, aren't they?"},"836":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah so."},"837":{"dur":2,"text":"- [Matt] What's the setup on the waggler?"},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"- It's quite simple, really."},"842":{"dur":2,"text":"I've got a 3AA waggler."},"845":{"dur":4,"text":"Just with a couple of\nnumber eights down the line."},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"And a microswivel as me last dropper."},"852":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Matt] What's that\nfor, the swivel, Scott?"},"853":{"dur":1,"text":"- Well it acts as your last dropper."},"855":{"dur":1,"text":"The main thing it does,"},"856":{"dur":1,"text":"it stops your hook line spinning up."},"858":{"dur":1,"text":"Especially when you're\nfishing double maggot,"},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"it spins 'round, and quite\noften you'll have to change"},"861":{"dur":2,"text":"your hook length, and it\njust saves time during"},"864":{"dur":1,"text":"a match, generally."},"866":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Matt] Yeah, that's a good little tip,"},"867":{"dur":1,"text":"always use a swivel when you're fishing"},"868":{"dur":1,"text":"a waggler on a river."},"869":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yeah, and the size\nof the swivel can vary,"},"871":{"dur":2,"text":"depending on what size\ndroppers you're using."},"874":{"dur":2,"text":"That one's sort of\nequivalent to a size eight or"},"876":{"dur":1,"text":"a nine."},"878":{"dur":1,"text":"- Lovely stuff."},"880":{"dur":1,"text":"So double maggot on there?"},"881":{"dur":1,"text":"- Double maggot again."},"883":{"dur":2,"text":"Catching little dace like that bleak."},"885":{"dur":1,"text":"We've seen an odd big chub top as well so."},"887":{"dur":1,"text":"With that in mind.\n- [Matt] Fingers crossed."},"889":{"dur":2,"text":"- With that in mind we're going to"},"892":{"dur":2,"text":"persevere on this for a bit and..."},"898":{"dur":3,"text":"A chevy as Walton referred to 'em as."},"904":{"dur":2,"text":"One just had a little go at\nyour maggots then, Scott."},"912":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, I think there's\nsome fish there moving now,"},"913":{"dur":2,"text":"to be honest, it's just,"},"916":{"dur":1,"text":"we caught a few more fish on the pole,"},"917":{"dur":2,"text":"we got a bream and a couple of eels but,"},"920":{"dur":2,"text":"we were definitely not gonna\ncatch a weight of roach on it."},"923":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's just about mixing it up and,"},"927":{"dur":2,"text":"trying to keep putting\nfish in the net, basically."},"930":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Matt] And this\nwaggler line's obviously,"},"931":{"dur":2,"text":"it's just past your pole\nline on that bit of flow"},"934":{"dur":2,"text":"going toward them weeds up there."},"936":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yeah I mean, I'm fishing well off"},"939":{"dur":1,"text":"the bottom at the
