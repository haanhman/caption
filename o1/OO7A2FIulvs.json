bit,"},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"but that goal is very\nmuch within reach."},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's good news,\nbut while there's"},"478":{"dur":1,"text":"good news in the\nprogress, we need"},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"to understand what's\nmaking that possible,"},"482":{"dur":3,"text":"and we need to not lose\nfocus because hunger"},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"is a very local

aren't\ngetting better."},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"So we need to learn from\nwhat we've done well"},"496":{"dur":1,"text":"in the successes\nthat we've seen,"},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"but we have to keep that at\nfocus and that commitment"},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"to actually ending\nhunger in our lifetime."},"503":{"dur":4,"text":"So I will just share briefly\nwhat Stop Hunger Now is doing."},"508":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, our roots do come\nfrom domestic hunger relief."},"511":{"dur":3,"text":"Our Founder Ray\nBuchanan helped found"},"515":{"dur":2,"text":"the Society of St.

realized the need to\naddress international hunger"},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"relief."},"529":{"dur":3,"text":"Initially our focus\nwas on crisis response."},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"But very quickly you\nlearn that the disasters"},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"that we read about-- the\nearthquakes, the tsunamis,"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"the famine brought about\nby war, et cetera-- that's"},"540":{"dur":1,"text":"only a small portion\nof the hunger that"},"541":{"dur":0,"text":"exists in the world."},"542":{"dur":1,"text":"In fact, the real\nneed is to address"},"544":{"dur":3,"text":"the chronic malnutrition\nthat exists."},"547":{"dur":4,"text":"And so what Stop Hunger\nNow began doing around 2005"},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"was working to address\nchronic malnutrition."},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"And we learned that one\nof the most effective ways"},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"to address chronic malnutrition\nin developing countries"},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"is school feeding programs."},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"So we initiated a\nmeal packaging program"},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"where volunteers, like the many\nGooglers who have participated"},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"with us, they come together\nand package these high protein"},"573":{"dur":0,"text":"dehydrated meals."},"574":{"dur":3,"text":"These meals have rice,\nsoy,

give them the\nmicronutrients that they"},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"need to overcome the\neffects of hunger."},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"So volunteers come together\nand package these

provide"},"619":{"dur":3,"text":"not only an immediate impact,\nbut really a long term impact."},"623":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, let me say more about that."},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"So of course, when you start\na school feeding program"},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"you're providing\nthe immediate immed"},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"that children need, to learn."},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"You'll hear in a moment how\nit's really impossible to learn."},"634":{"dur":3,"text":"You can't think, concentrate,\non an empty belly."},"637":{"dur":3,"text":"But also what we find is when we\nstart a school feeding program,"},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"those meals act is a\ntremendous incentive"},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"for parents to send their\nchildren to school, knowing"},"646":{"dur":1,"text":"that they'll get a hot meal."},"648":{"dur":3,"text":"What does that do, as school\nenrollment rates increase"},"651":{"dur":1,"text":"dramatically--\nsometimes we've seen"},"653":{"dur":4,"text":"double, triple,

hope."},"663":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's through that\neducation that we"},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"can begin to break the\ncycle of poverty that"},"667":{"dur":1,"text":"so often keeps\nhunger in existence."},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"DIANE SOLINGER: Let's take\nthat a little bit further"},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"because we have Eddy here, and\nEddy is from an

personally\nwork with them"},"724":{"dur":1,"text":"with a school feeding program."},"726":{"dur":4,"text":"I remember when I started, we\nwere feeding 56,000 children,"},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"and
