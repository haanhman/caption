the buildings that were around me"},"43":{"dur":3,"text":"and that were being designed"},"46":{"dur":4,"text":"and that were there in the publications I was seeing"},"50":{"dur":3,"text":"felt

quickly,"},"135":{"dur":2,"text":"something we've been working on very recently"},"137":{"dur":2,"text":"is we were commissioned by the mayor of London"},"139":{"dur":2,"text":"to design a new bus"},"141":{"dur":3,"text":"that gave the passenger"},"144":{"dur":2,"text":"their freedom again."},"146":{"dur":2,"text":"Because the original Routemaster bus"},"148":{"dur":2,"text":"that some of you may be familiar with,"},"150":{"dur":2,"text":"which had this open platform at the back --"},"152":{"dur":2,"text":"in fact, I think all our Routemasters"},"154":{"dur":2,"text":"are here in California now actually."},"156":{"dur":3,"text":"But they aren't in London."},"159":{"dur":2,"text":"And so you're stuck on a bus."},"161":{"dur":3,"text":"And if the bus is going to stop"},"164":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's three yards away from the bus stop,"},"167":{"dur":2,"text":"you're just a prisoner."},"169":{"dur":2,"text":"But the mayor of London wanted to reintroduce"},"171":{"dur":3,"text":"buses with this open platform."},"174":{"dur":4,"text":"So we've been working with Transport for London,"},"178":{"dur":2,"text":"and that organization"},"180":{"dur":2,"text":"hasn't actually been responsible"},"182":{"dur":2,"text":"as a client for a new bus"},"184":{"dur":2,"text":"for 50 years."},"186":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we've been very lucky to have a chance to work."},"189":{"dur":3,"text":"The brief is that the bus should use 40 percent less energy."},"192":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's got hybrid drive."},"194":{"dur":2,"text":"And we've been working"},"196":{"dur":2,"text":"to try to improve"},"198":{"dur":2,"text":"everything from the fabric"},"200":{"dur":2,"text":"to the format"},"202":{"dur":2,"text":"and structure"},"204":{"dur":2,"text":"and aesthetics."},"206":{"dur":3,"text":"I was going to show four main projects."},"209":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is a project for a bridge."},"212":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we were commissioned to design a bridge that would open."},"215":{"dur":2,"text":"And openings seemed --"},"217":{"dur":2,"text":"everyone loves opening bridges,"},"219":{"dur":3,"text":"but it's quite a basic thing."},"222":{"dur":2,"text":"I think we all kind of stand and watch."},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"But the bridges that we saw"},"226":{"dur":3,"text":"that opened and closed --"},"229":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm slightly squeamish --"},"233":{"dur":3,"text":"but I once saw a photograph of a footballer"},"236":{"dur":2,"text":"who was diving for a ball."},"238":{"dur":3,"text":"And as he was diving, someone had stamped on his knee,"},"241":{"dur":3,"text":"and it had broken like this."},"244":{"dur":4,"text":"And then we looked at these kinds of bridges"},"248":{"dur":2,"text":"and just couldn't help feeling"},"250":{"dur":3,"text":"that it was a beautiful thing that had broken."},"253":{"dur":3,"text":"And so this is in Paddington in London."},"256":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's a very boring bridge, as you can see."},"258":{"dur":3,"text":"It's just steel and timber."},"264":{"dur":3,"text":"But instead of what it is,"},"267":{"dur":4,"text":"our focus was on the way it worked."},"275":{"dur":7,"text":"(Applause)"},"282":{"dur":3,"text":"So we liked the idea that the two farthest bits of it"},"285":{"dur":3,"text":"would end up kissing each other."},"290":{"dur":8,"text":"(Applause)"},"298":{"dur":2,"text":"We actually had to halve its speed,"},"300":{"dur":2,"text":"because everyone was too scared when we first did it."},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's it speeded up."},"304":{"dur":3,"text":"A project that we've been working on very recently"},"307":{"dur":3,"text":"is to design a new biomass power station --"},"310":{"dur":4,"text":"so a power station that uses organic waste material."},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"In the news,"},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"the subject of where our future water is going to come from"},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"and where our power is going to come from"},"320":{"dur":3,"text":"is in all the papers all the time."},"323":{"dur":4,"text":"And we used to be quite proud of the way we generated power."},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"But recently,"},"329":{"dur":3,"text":"any annual report of a power company"},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"doesn't have a power station on it."},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"It has a child running through a field, or something like that."},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"(Laughter)"},"338":{"dur":4,"text":"And so when a consortium of engineers approached us"},"342":{"dur":3,"text":"and asked us to work with them on this power station,"},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"our condition was that we would work with them"},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"and that, whatever we did,"},"349":{"dur":5,"text":"we were not just going to decorate a normal power station."},"354":{"dur":3,"text":"And instead, we had to learn -- we kind of forced them to teach us."},"357":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we spent time traveling with them"},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"and learning about all the different elements,"},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"and finding that there were plenty of inefficiencies"},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"that weren't being capitalized on."},"366":{"dur":3,"text":"That just taking a field and banging all these things out"},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"isn't necessarily the most efficient way that they could work."},"372":{"dur":5,"text":"So we looked at how we could compose all those elements --"},"377":{"dur":3,"text":"instead of just litter, create one composition."},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"And what we found --"},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"this area is one of the poorest parts of Britain."},"384":{"dur":3,"text":"It was voted the worst place in Britain to live."},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"And there are 2,000 new homes being built"},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"next to this power station."},"391":{"dur":3,"text":"So it felt this has a social dimension."},"394":{"dur":2,"text":"It has a symbolic importance."},"396":{"dur":3,"text":"And we should be proud of where our power is coming from,"},"399":{"dur":3,"text":"rather than something we are necessarily ashamed of."},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"So we were looking at how we could make a power station,"},"404":{"dur":2,"text":"that, instead of keeping people out"},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"and having a big fence around the outside,"},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"could be a place that pulls you in."},"410":{"dur":3,"text":"And it has to be --"},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm trying to get my --"},"415":{"dur":3,"text":"250 feet high."},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"So it felt that what we could try to do"},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"is make a power park"},"423":{"dur":2,"text":"and actually bring the whole area in,"},"425":{"dur":3,"text":"and using the spare soil that's there on the site,"},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"we could make a power station that was silent as well."},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"Because just that soil"},"432":{"dur":2,"text":"could make the acoustic difference."},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"And we also found that we could make a more efficient structure"},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"and have a cost-effective way"},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"of making a structure to do this."},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"The finished project"},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"is meant to be more than just a power station."},"445":{"dur":3,"text":"It has a space where you could have a bar mitzvah at the top."},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"(Laughter)"},"450":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's a power park."},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"So people can come and really experience this"},"456":{"dur":3,"text":"and also look out all around the area,"},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"and use that height that we have to have for its function."},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"In Shanghai,"},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"we were invited to build --"},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"well we weren't invited; what am I talking about."},"468":{"dur":3,"text":"We won the competition, and it was painful to get there."},"471":{"dur":4,"text":"(Laughter)"},"475":{"dur":3,"text":"So we won the competition to build the U.K. pavilion."},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"And an expo"},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"is a totally bonkers thing."},"482":{"dur":3,"text":"There's 250 pavilions."},"485":{"dur":4,"text":"It's the world's biggest ever expo that had ever happened."},"489":{"dur":3,"text":"So there are up to a million people there everyday."},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"And 250 countries all competing."},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"And the British government saying,"},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"\"You need to be in the top five.\""},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that became"},"500":{"dur":3,"text":"the governmental goal --"},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"is, how do you stand out in this chaos,"},"506":{"dur":4,"text":"which is an expo of stimulus?"},"510":{"dur":4,"text":"So our sense was we had to do one thing,"},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"and only one thing,"},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"instead of trying to have everything."},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"And so what we also felt"},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"was that whatever we did we couldn't do a cheesy advert for Britain."},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"(Laughter)"},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"But the thing that was true,"},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"the expo was about the future of cities,"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"and particularly the Victorians"},"532":{"dur":3,"text":"pioneered integrating nature into the cities."},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"And the world's first public park of modern times"},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"was in Britain."},"539":{"dur":3,"text":"And the world's first major botanical institution"},"542":{"dur":2,"text":"is in London,"},"544":{"dur":2,"text":"and they have this extraordinary project"},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"where they've been collecting 25 percent"},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"of all the world's plant species."},"550":{"dur":3,"text":"So we suddenly realized that there was this thing."},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"And everyone agrees that trees are beautiful,"},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"and I've never met anyone who says, \"I don't like trees.\""},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"And the same with flowers."},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"I've never met anyone who says, \"I don't like flowers.\""},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"But we realized that seeds --"},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"there's been this very serious project happening --"},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"but that seeds --"},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"at these major botanical gardens,"},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"seeds aren't on show."},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"But you just have to go to a garden center,"},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"and they're in little paper packets."},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"But this phenomenal project's been happening."},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"So we realized we had to make a project"},"582":{"dur":3,"text":"that would be seeds, some kind of seed cathedral."},"585":{"dur":3,"text":"But how could we show these teeny-weeny things?"},"588":{"dur":3,"text":"And the film \"Jurassic Park\" actually really helped us."},"591":{"dur":3,"text":"Because the DNA of the dinosaur that was trapped in the amber"},"594":{"dur":3,"text":"gave us some kind of clue"},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"that these tiny things"},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"could be trapped and be made to seem precious,"},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"rather than looking like nuts."},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"So the challenge was,"},"606":{"dur":3,"text":"how are we going to bring light and expose these things?"},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"We didn't want to make a separate building and have separate content."},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"So we were trying to think,"},"614":{"dur":3,"text":"how could we make a whole thing emanate."},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"By the way, we had half the budget of the other Western nations."},"619":{"dur":3,"text":"So that was also in the mix"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"with the site the size of a football pitch."},"624":{"dur":3,"text":"And so there was one particular toy that gave us a clue."},"627":{"dur":3,"text":"(Video) Voice Over: The new Play-Doh Mop Top Hair Shop."},"630":{"dur":3,"text":"Song: \u266b We've got the Mop Tops, the Play-Doh Mop Tops \u266b"},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"\u266b Just turn the chair and grow Play-Doh hair \u266b"},"635":{"dur":2,"text":"\u266b They're the Mop Tops \u266b"},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"Thomas Heatherwick: Okay, you get the idea."},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"So the idea"},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"was to take these 66,000 seeds"},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"that they agreed to give us,"},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"and to take each seed and trap it"},"647":{"dur":3,"text":"in this precious optical hair"},"650":{"dur":3,"text":"and grow that through this box,"},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"very simple box element,"},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"and make it a building"},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"that could move in the wind."},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"So the whole thing can gently move when the wind blows."},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"And inside, the daylight --"},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"each one is an optic"},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"and it brings light into the center."},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"And by night,"},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"artificial light in each one"},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"emanates and comes out to the outside."},"675":{"dur":3,"text":"And to make the project affordable,"},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"we focused our energy."},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"Instead of building a building as big as the football pitch,"},"682":{"dur":3,"text":"we focused it on this one element."},"685":{"dur":3,"text":"And the government agreed to do that"},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"and not do anything else,"},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"and focus our energy on that."},"692":{"dur":3,"text":"And so the rest of the site was a public space."},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"And with a million people there a day,"},"697":{"dur":3,"text":"it just felt like offering some public space."},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"We worked with an AstroTurf manufacturer"},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"to develop a mini-me version"},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"of the seed cathedral,"},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"so that, even if you're partially-sighted,"},"709":{"dur":3,"text":"that it was kind of crunchy and soft,"},"712":{"dur":3,"text":"that piece of landscape that you see there."},"715":{"dur":4,"text":"And then, you know when a pet has an operation"},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"and they shave a bit of the skin"},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"and get rid of the fur --"},"723":{"dur":3,"text":"in order to get you to go into the seed cathedral,"},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"in effect, we've shaved it."},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"And inside there's nothing;"},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"there's no famous actor's voice;"},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"there's no projections;"},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"there's no televisions; there's no color changing."},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"There's just silence"},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"and a cool temperature."},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"And if a cloud goes past,"},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"you can see a cloud on the tips"},"745":{"dur":3,"text":"where it's letting the light through."},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the only project that we've done"},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"where the finished thing"},"755":{"dur":3,"text":"looked more like a rendering than our renderings."},"758":{"dur":4,"text":"(Laughter)"},"764":{"dur":3,"text":"A key thing was how people would interact."},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, in a way it was the most serious thing"},"769":{"dur":2,"text":"you could possible do at the expo."},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"And I just wanted to show you."},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"The British government --"},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"any government is potentially the worst client in the world"},"778":{"dur":3,"text":"you could ever possibly want to have."},"781":{"dur":3,"text":"And there was a lot of terror."},"784":{"dur":3,"text":"But there was an underlying support."},"787":{"dur":3,"text":"And so there was a moment"},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"when suddenly -- actually, the next thing."},"792":{"dur":3,"text":"This is the head of U.K. Trade and Investment,"},"795":{"dur":3,"text":"who was our client,"},"798":{"dur":4,"text":"with the Chinese children, using the landscape."},"802":{"dur":3,"text":"(Video) Children: One, two, three,

something."},"821":{"dur":3,"text":"In the projects we've been working on,"},"824":{"dur":2,"text":"these slick buildings,"},"826":{"dur":3,"text":"where they might be a fancy shape,"},"829":{"dur":2,"text":"but the materiality feels the same,"},"831":{"dur":4,"text":"is something that we've been trying to research really,"},"835":{"dur":3,"text":"and explore alternatives."},"838":{"dur":3,"text":"And the project that we're building in Malaysia"},"841":{"dur":2,"text":"is apartment buildings"},"843":{"dur":2,"text":"for a property developer."},"845":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's in a piece of land"},"847":{"dur":2,"text":"that's this site."},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"And the mayor of Kuala Lumpur"},"851":{"dur":2,"text":"said that, if this developer"},"853":{"dur":3,"text":"would give something that gave something back to the city,"},"856":{"dur":3,"text":"they would give them more gross floor area, buildable."},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"So there was an incentive for the developer"},"861":{"dur":2,"text":"to really try to think about"},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"what would be better for the city."},"865":{"dur":2,"text":"And the conventional thing with apartment buildings"},"867":{"dur":2,"text":"in this part of the world"},"869":{"dur":2,"text":"is you have your tower,"},"871":{"dur":3,"text":"and you squeeze a few trees around the edge,"},"874":{"dur":2,"text":"and you see cars parked."},"876":{"dur":3,"text":"It's actually only the first couple of floors that you really experience,"},"879":{"dur":3,"text":"and the rest of it is just for postcards."},"882":{"dur":3,"text":"The lowest value is actually the bottom part of a tower like this."},"885":{"dur":2,"text":"So if we could chop that away"},"887":{"dur":2,"text":"and give the building a small bottom,"},"889":{"dur":3,"text":"we could take that bit and put it at the top"},"892":{"dur":3,"text":"where the greater commercial value is for a property developer."},"895":{"dur":2,"text":"And by linking these together,"},"897":{"dur":3,"text":"we could have 90 percent of the site"},"900":{"dur":2,"text":"as a rainforest,"},"902":{"dur":2,"text":"instead of only 10 percent of scrubby trees"},"904":{"dur":2,"text":"and bits of road around buildings."},"906":{"dur":4,"text":"(Applause)"},"910":{"dur":3,"text":"So we're building these buildings."},"913":{"dur":3,"text":"They're actually identical, so it's quite cost-effective."},"916":{"dur":2,"text":"They're just chopped at different heights."},"918":{"dur":2,"text":"But the key part"},"920":{"dur":3,"text":"is trying to give back an extraordinary piece of
