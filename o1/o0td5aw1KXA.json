how I came to learn"},"117":{"dur":2,"text":"that not only does our brain shape us,"},"119":{"dur":4,"text":"but that we can actually shape our brain."},"124":{"dur":3,"text":"My story began in Grade 1,"},"127":{"dur":4,"text":"and in Grade 1 I was identified \nas having a mental block."},"131":{"dur":2,"text":"I was told I had a defect."},"134":{"dur":4,"text":"And I was told I would never learn \nlike other children."},"139":{"dur":4,"text":"And really, the message at that time \nwas loud and clear."},"143":{"dur":5,"text":"I was told I needed to learn to live \nwith those limitations."},"148":{"dur":6,"text":"And this was 1957, and it was the time \nof the unchangeable brain."},"154":{"dur":5,"text":"And childhood was \na profound struggle for me."},"160":{"dur":3,"text":"I couldn't tell time. \nI couldn't understand the relationship"},"164":{"dur":4,"text":"between an hour hand \nand a minute hand on a clock."},"168":{"dur":5,"text":"I couldn't understand language. \nMost of what I read, or heard,"},"174":{"dur":3,"text":"was really as intelligible \nas the 'Jabberwocky'."},"178":{"dur":2,"text":"I could understand concrete things."},"180":{"dur":2,"text":"If somebody said to me, \n\"The man is wearing a black coat\","},"183":{"dur":3,"text":"I could paint the picture in my head, \nand I could understand that."},"187":{"dur":6,"text":"But what I couldn't do was understand \nconcepts, or ideas, or relationships."},"193":{"dur":3,"text":"So, lots of things were confusing."},"197":{"dur":5,"text":"I pondered, how could my aunt also \nbe my mother's sister?"},"202":{"dur":5,"text":"And what did that fraction, \n1\/4, really mean?"},"208":{"dur":3,"text":"Any kind of abstract concept \nwas hard for me."},"212":{"dur":3,"text":"Irony and jokes: that was impossible."},"215":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I learned to laugh \nwhen other people did."},"219":{"dur":4,"text":"Cause and effect: \nit did not exist in my world."},"224":{"dur":4,"text":"There were no reasons \nbehind why things happened."},"229":{"dur":6,"text":"My world was a series of disconnected \nbits and pieces of unrelated fragments."},"235":{"dur":4,"text":"And eventually, \nmy fragmented view of the world"},"239":{"dur":5,"text":"ended up causing \na very fragmented sense of myself."},"245":{"dur":3,"text":"And that wasn't all: \nthis whole left side of my body"},"249":{"dur":4,"text":"was like an alien being, \nunconnected to the rest of me."},"253":{"dur":3,"text":"I would bang and bump into things \non the left side of my body."},"256":{"dur":3,"text":"If I picked up anything in this left hand,\nI would drop it."},"260":{"dur":3,"text":"If I put this left hand on the hot burner,\nI would feel pain,"},"264":{"dur":3,"text":"but I had no idea \nwhere it was coming from."},"267":{"dur":3,"text":"I was truly a danger to myself."},"271":{"dur":4,"text":"My mother, she was convinced \nI would be dead by the age of 5."},"276":{"dur":3,"text":"And then, if that wasn't enough, \nI had a spatial problem."},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"I couldn't imagine \nthree-dimensional space."},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"I couldn't create maps in my head."},"285":{"dur":4,"text":"I would constantly get lost,\neven in my friend's house."},"289":{"dur":2,"text":"Crossing the street

shame."},"301":{"dur":4,"text":"I felt there was something horribly, \nhorribly wrong with me."},"305":{"dur":3,"text":"And in my child's mind, \nwhen I'd heard that diagnosis,"},"308":{"dur":3,"text":"of having a mental block, \nI actually thought"},"312":{"dur":4,"text":"I had a wooden cube in my head \nthat made learning difficult."},"316":{"dur":4,"text":"And I didn't have a piece of wood \nin my head, but I wasn't far wrong."},"321":{"dur":3,"text":"I had blockages, as I was later to learn,"},"324":{"dur":3,"text":"in very critical parts of my brain."},"328":{"dur":4,"text":"And I tried all the traditional approaches, \nthey were all about compensation,"},"333":{"dur":2,"text":"and about working around the problem,"},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"finding a strength to support a weakness."},"338":{"dur":5,"text":"They were not about trying to address \nthe source of the problem,"},"344":{"dur":6,"text":"and they took heroic effort, \nand led to rather limited results for me."},"351":{"dur":3,"text":"Then, Grade 8."},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"I hit the wall."},"357":{"dur":3,"text":"I could not imagine \nhow I could go on to high school,"},"361":{"dur":3,"text":"and handle more complex curriculum."},"365":{"dur":4,"text":"The only option I could see \nwas ending my life."},"369":{"dur":5,"text":"So, I decided to end the pain."},"374":{"dur":4,"text":"And the next morning, when I woke up \nafter my failed suicide attempt,"},"379":{"dur":4,"text":"I berated myself for not even being able\nto get that right."},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I soldiered on."},"386":{"dur":6,"text":"And part of what kept me going was \nan attitude that I learned from my father."},"393":{"dur":4,"text":"He was an inventor, and he was passionate \nabout the creative process."},"397":{"dur":5,"text":"He taught me that if there's a problem,\nand there's no solution,"},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"you go out and create a solution."},"406":{"dur":3,"text":"And the other thing he taught me was"},"409":{"dur":4,"text":"that before you can solve a problem, \nyou have to identify its nature."},"414":{"dur":4,"text":"So I continued my hunt. \nI went on to study psychology,"},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"to try to understand \nwhat was wrong with me,"},"422":{"dur":3,"text":"what was the source of my problem."},"425":{"dur":8,"text":"And then, in the summer of 1977, \nsomething life-altering happened."},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"I met a mind like my own,"},"438":{"dur":5,"text":"A Russian soldier, Lev Zasetsky, \nthe only difference being"},"443":{"dur":3,"text":"his mind was shaped by a bullet,"},"446":{"dur":3,"text":"and mine had been that way since birth."},"450":{"dur":4,"text":"I met Zasestky on the pages of a book,\n'The Man With a Shattered World',"},"455":{"dur":4,"text":"wrtitten by the brilliant Russian\nneuropsychologist, Alexander Luria."},"460":{"dur":3,"text":"As I read Zasetsky's story,"},"463":{"dur":4,"text":"he couldn't tell time, \nhe described living in a dense fog."},"467":{"dur":3,"text":"All he got was fragments, bits and pieces."},"470":{"dur":3,"text":"This man was living my life."},"474":{"dur":3,"text":"So now, at the age of 25, in 1977,"},"478":{"dur":3,"text":"I knew the source of my problem."},"481":{"dur":5,"text":"It was a part of my brain, in the left \nhemisphere, that wasn't working."},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I came across the work \nof Mark Rosenzweig,"},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"and he showed me a solution."},"492":{"dur":1,"text":"Rosenzweig was working with rats,"},"494":{"dur":4,"text":"and he found that rats in an enriched \nand stimulating environment"},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"were better learners."},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"And then he went \nand looked at their brains:"},"502":{"dur":5,"text":"their brains had changed physiologically \nto support that learning."},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"And this was neuroplasticity in action."},"511":{"dur":4,"text":"Neuroplasticity, simply put, \nthe brain's ability to change"},"516":{"dur":4,"text":"physiologically and functionally, \nas the result of stimulation."},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"So now I knew what I had to do."},"523":{"dur":4,"text":"I had to find a way to work, \nto exercise my brain,"},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"to strengthen those weak parts."},"530":{"dur":4,"text":"And this was the beginning of \nmy transformation and of my life's work."},"535":{"dur":5,"text":"And I had to believe that humans must have\nat least as much neuroplasticity,"},"541":{"dur":3,"text":"and hopefully more, than rats."},"544":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I went on to create my first exercise."},"547":{"dur":4,"text":"And I used clocks, because clocks \nare form of relationship,"},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"and I had never been able to tell time."},"554":{"dur":1,"text":"So I started with the two-handed clock,"},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"to force my brain \nto process relationships,"},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"and then I added a third hand, \nand then a fourth hand,"},"562":{"dur":4,"text":"because I wanted to make my brain \nto work harder, and harder, and harder,"},"566":{"dur":4,"text":"to pull together concepts \nand understand their connection."},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"And about three to four months in,"},"572":{"dur":4,"text":"I knew something significant had changed."},"577":{"dur":4,"text":"I'd always wanted to read philosophy, \nand had never been able to understand it."},"582":{"dur":4,"text":"And I just happened to have access \nto a philosophy library."},"586":{"dur":3,"text":"So I went in, \nand I pulled a book off the shelf,"},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"and I opened it to a page at random,"},"591":{"dur":4,"text":"and I read that page, \nand I understood it as I was reading it."},"596":{"dur":3,"text":"This had never happened in my entire life."},"600":{"dur":3,"text":"And then I thought, maybe it's a fluke, \nmaybe that was just an easy book."},"603":{"dur":4,"text":"So I pulled another book off the shelf, \nopened it, read it, and understood it."},"608":{"dur":4,"text":"And by the time I was finished, I was \nsurrounded by a pile of a hundred books,"},"612":{"dur":4,"text":"and I had been able to read \nand understand each page."},"617":{"dur":3,"text":"So I knew that something had changed."},"620":{"dur":4,"text":"(Applause)"},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"Thank you. My experiment had worked."},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"The human brain was capable of change."},"630":{"dur":1,"text":"And then I decided to create an exercise"},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"for that alien part of my body,"},"634":{"dur":3,"text":"and for that I knew I had to work \non an area in the right hemisphere,"},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"the somatosensory cortex \nthat registers sensation."},"641":{"dur":5,"text":"I created an exercise for that \nand I am no longer a danger to myself."},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I decided, that spatial problem,"},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"because I was really tired \nof getting lost,"},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"and so I created \nanother exercise for that,"},"654":{"dur":4,"text":"and I don't get lost, I can actually \nread maps -- I don't like GPS's,"},"659":{"dur":3,"text":"because I like to read maps now, \nbecause I can. (Laughter)"},"662":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I knew now, the brain could change."},"666":{"dur":4,"text":"I was living proof \nof human neuroplasticity."},"671":{"dur":4,"text":"And what really breaks my heart"},"676":{"dur":3,"text":"is that I still meet people today,"},"679":{"dur":5,"text":"children, individuals, that are struggling\nwith learning problems,"},"685":{"dur":4,"text":"and they're still being told \nwhat I was told in 1957,"},"690":{"dur":3,"text":"that they need to learn to live \nwith their limitations,"},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"they don't dare to dream."},"696":{"dur":3,"text":"And what I learned since 1977,"},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"when I met Zasetsky and Luria, \nand Rosenzweig,"},"704":{"dur":3,"text":"is that, yes, our brain does shape us,"},"707":{"dur":5,"text":"it impacts how we can engage, \nand participate, and be in the world,"},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"and every single one of us"},"715":{"dur":4,"text":"has our own unique profile \nof cognitive strengths and weaknesses."},"719":{"dur":5,"text":"And if there's a limitation, \nwe don't necessarily have to live with it."},"725":{"dur":3,"text":"We now know about neuroplasticity,"},"728":{"dur":5,"text":"and we can harness \nthe brain's changeable characteristics,"},"733":{"dur":6,"text":"to create programs to actually strengthen \nand stimulate and change our brain."},"740":{"dur":6,"text":"And in 1966, Rosenzweig \nthrew down the gauntlet."},"746":{"dur":4,"text":"He said, his challenge was: \n\"Let's take what he'd learned with rats,"},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"and apply it to human learning.\""},"753":{"dur":4,"text":"And we need to embrace that challenge,"},"758":{"dur":3,"text":"we need to also challenge \ncurrent practices"},"762":{"dur":5,"text":"that are still operating out of \nthat paradigm of the unchangeable brain."},"767":{"dur":4,"text":"We need to work together to take \nwhat we know now about neuroplasticity,"},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"and develop programs \nthat actually shape our brains,"},"776":{"dur":3,"text":"to change the future of learning."},"779":{"dur":3,"text":"My vision is of a world that we create,"},"783":{"dur":3,"text":"in which no child has to live"},"786":{"dur":5,"text":"with the ongoing struggle and pain \nof a learning disability."},"791":{"dur":6,"text":"My vision is that cognitive exercises \nbecome just a normal part of curriculum."},"798":{"dur":6,"text":"My vision is that school becomes a place \nthat we go to strengthen our brain,"},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"to become really efficient \nand effective learners,"},"808":{"dur":3,"text":"engaged in a learning process,"},"812":{"dur":4,"text":"where not only, as learners, \ncan we dare to dream,"},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"but we can realize our dream."},"819":{"dur":5,"text":"And to me, this is the perfect marriage \nbetween neuroscience and education."},"824":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you."},"826":{"dur":5,"text":"(Applause)"}}
