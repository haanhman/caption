19 years old."},"134":{"dur":0,"text":"I'm kind of naive."},"135":{"dur":1,"text":"This guy is a\nprofessional recruiter."},"137":{"dur":1,"text":"Why is he going to lie to

right?"},"193":{"dur":3,"text":"SPEAKER: So any TV\nshow or book I've read,"},"197":{"dur":3,"text":"it's just a hugely\ndemanding kind of a way"},"200":{"dur":1,"text":"to weed out some of\nthe candidates early"},"202":{"dur":4,"text":"in the SEAL process, and the\nmental fortitude it takes"},"206":{"dur":1,"text":"is just so impressive."},"207":{"dur":2,"text":"So can you give the

every\nNavy SEAL needs to go through,"},"217":{"dur":2,"text":"and it stands for Basic\nUnderwater Demolition SEAL"},"219":{"dur":1,"text":"training."},"221":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's the one that you\nsee on a lot of the TV shows,"},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's in a lot of books."},"227":{"dur":1,"text":"It's the hardest\nmilitary training"},"229":{"dur":3,"text":"in the world from the\nfirst day to the end."},"233":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, there's about three or four\nmonths prior to the first day"},"235":{"dur":1,"text":"if that makes any sense."},"237":{"dur":1,"text":"But once you start,\nit's 26 weeks."},"242":{"dur":1,"text":"The beginning of it,\nthe first 9 to 10 weeks"},"244":{"dur":1,"text":"is all calisthenics."},"246":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's like, the\nworkout starts at 5:00"},"249":{"dur":2,"text":"AM, which means you've\ngot up at 4:00 or whatever"},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"and class gets together,\ngets a full headcount."},"253":{"dur":1,"text":"The workout starts at or 5:00."},"255":{"dur":1,"text":"You work until about\n6:30, go to breakfast."},"257":{"dur":1,"text":"Then you come\nback, and you'll do"},"259":{"dur":2,"text":"like two hours of\nlog workouts, which"},"261":{"dur":1,"text":"means you've got a\ncouple-hundred-pound logs,"},"263":{"dur":1,"text":"where you're working\nout with six guys each"},"265":{"dur":1,"text":"holding a log doing\ndifferent drills,"},"267":{"dur":1,"text":"through negative\nreinforcement teaching you"},"269":{"dur":4,"text":"that if one guy doesn't pull his\nweight then the team will fail."},"273":{"dur":1,"text":"And then you'll rest and\nchange into something."},"275":{"dur":3,"text":"You have a seven-mile\nconditioning run"},"278":{"dur":2,"text":"in the soft sand, followed\nby a two-mile timed swim"},"281":{"dur":0,"text":"in the ocean."},"282":{"dur":1,"text":"Then you'd run to\nthe pool, which"},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"is a mile and a half away, swim\nthere, get tied up, thrown in,"},"286":{"dur":1,"text":"do different drills."},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"You do this all day\nlong every single day."},"289":{"dur":3,"text":"And something funny, too,\nthat no one seems to realize"},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"is, from where you do these\nworkouts to the galley--"},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"which is where you eat--"},"297":{"dur":1,"text":"it's a mile away."},"298":{"dur":2,"text":"So no matter what, you're\nrunning six miles a day"},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"just to eat."},"303":{"dur":0,"text":"I love this building."},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"Food is 300 feet\naway at all times."},"306":{"dur":1,"text":"That's not a bad gig."},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"But yeah, it's a tough course."},"309":{"dur":2,"text":"One of the hardest parts\nis called Hell Week, which"},"312":{"dur":3,"text":"is where they wake you up for\ntraining on Sunday late morning"},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"and then you do that kind\nof training around the clock"},"318":{"dur":1,"text":"every day until Friday."},"319":{"dur":1,"text":"So you don't sleep."},"321":{"dur":0,"text":"It's miserable."},"322":{"dur":3,"text":"It's so bad they keep you\ncovered in salt water and sand"},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"the entire time."},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"By Wednesday morning,\nyour skin is so soft"},"330":{"dur":1,"text":"that every part of your\nbody that touches cloth"},"332":{"dur":1,"text":"starts to bleed."},"334":{"dur":1,"text":"And you're wearing\nclothes, so you just"},"336":{"dur":1,"text":"become a bloody, sloppy mess."},"337":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a horrible time."},"339":{"dur":1,"text":"Right now, I think it's\n85% of the people who"},"341":{"dur":1,"text":"try out do not make it through."},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"ROB O'NEILL: And that's\nthe initial testing"},"345":{"dur":1,"text":"to try to become a SEAL."},"346":{"dur":3,"text":"After that, it's another year\nuntil you get your Trident"},"350":{"dur":2,"text":"and become a SEAL-- more\nadvanced tactics, small unit"},"352":{"dur":4,"text":"stuff, tendencies of\nother people and all that."},"357":{"dur":1,"text":"But it's a tough course."},"358":{"dur":3,"text":"SPEAKER: So once you finished\nyour training, after BUD\/S,"},"361":{"dur":1,"text":"you make it onto the SEAL team."},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"That brought you to a couple\nof different deployments,"},"365":{"dur":2,"text":"and one of those\nwas Afghanistan."},"370":{"dur":1,"text":"ROB O'NEILL: I got\nthere pre 9\/11,"},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"so my first four\ndeployments were actually"},"374":{"dur":3,"text":"to a lot of Europe,\na lot of Africa,"},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"some of the Middle East."},"379":{"dur":1,"text":"The only jobs we\nreally had going"},"381":{"dur":3,"text":"on as far special operators were\nlike Kosovo, Bosnia, Liberia."},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"There was a few things we had\nto go help with the embassies."},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"Generally, they were training--"},"390":{"dur":1,"text":"training with Allied\nSpecial Forces in case"},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"of contingencies, like\nthe stuff that we actually"},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"saw after 9\/11, the stuff\nin North Korea right now,"},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"training with our allies."},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"Because we were SEALs,\nwe worked with people"},"400":{"dur":4,"text":"called the Special Boat Service,\nthe SBS, the Brits in the UK."},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"We'd work with some of our\nNorthern Africa allies a lot,"},"407":{"dur":3,"text":"some of our United Arab\nEmirates, Norwegian Jaegers,"},"411":{"dur":2,"text":"things like that."},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"I didn't go to Afghanistan\nuntil after 9\/11."},"415":{"dur":0,"text":"Got ya."},"416":{"dur":1,"text":"So when you did\nget to Afghanistan,"},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"though, in the book it seemed\nlike it was a new environment"},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"It was a little ambiguous."},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"Can you talk us\nthrough how you were"},"426":{"dur":4,"text":"able to make decision-making\nprocesses and strategy"},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"decisions in an ambiguous\nenvironment like that?"},"432":{"dur":0,"text":"It was, too."},"433":{"dur":4,"text":"We'd never really been to war\nas a nation since Vietnam,"},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"and we'd never been\nin a war like this,"},"439":{"dur":3,"text":"a certain counterinsurgency-type\noperation like in Afghanistan."},"443":{"dur":1,"text":"And when we first\nstarted going there,"},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"we realized that the way\nyou're going to win that-- not"},"447":{"dur":3,"text":"win that, but make it more\nstable, I guess-- would be you"},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"need the locals to\nbe on your team."},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"You need them to like you."},"454":{"dur":1,"text":"And a lot of people\nsay hearts and minds."},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that gets overused."},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"More minds than anything."},"459":{"dur":1,"text":"We were trying to be innovative."},"461":{"dur":3,"text":"And we realized that if we\ncan make their lives better,"},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"we can get them on our team."},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"And how do you make\nsomeone's life better?"},"468":{"dur":0,"text":"Family first."},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"You want to help them\nsupport their family."},"470":{"dur":0,"text":"So you've got to give him a job."},"471":{"dur":1,"text":"So we would find\na spot with some"},"472":{"dur":1,"text":"of the money we\nwere given, and we'd"},"474":{"dur":1,"text":"get what's called a safe house."},"475":{"dur":1,"text":"So you'd buy a building,\nmake it a safe house,"},"477":{"dur":3,"text":"then you hire first\nsecurity-- so you actually"},"481":{"dur":3,"text":"have interviews with locals\nthat know how to use guns."},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"So they are your security,\nonce you vet them."},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"You hire plumbers,\nmake your place better."},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"You're hiring cooks,\nhiring all kinds of stuff--"},"490":{"dur":0,"text":"drivers."},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"And then we actually expanded\nit to going out in the towns,"},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"shopping in the bazaars,\neating at the restaurants"},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"in Afghanistan, getting\nto know the neighbors"},"500":{"dur":4,"text":"and their children so that if\na parent sees you getting along"},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"with their, kids they're going\nto try to protect you as best"},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"they can from people\nlike the Taliban,"},"509":{"dur":1,"text":"like al-Qaeda, through anything."},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"Because it's not just\nbombs and bullets,"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"it's human intelligence."},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"People that go to the internet\ncafes and the coffee shops,"},"518":{"dur":1,"text":"they're hearing stuff\nfrom other people."},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"They're talking to\ntheir cousins who"},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"hear from the Taliban,\nintel chains like that."},"524":{"dur":1,"text":"So it was working for a while."},"525":{"dur":1,"text":"We-- I felt like we\nhad it won over there"},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"for a long, long time."},"530":{"dur":4,"text":"The issue is a lot of\ngovernment agencies,"},"534":{"dur":0,"text":"they're not innovative."},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"And they love to say this is\nthe way we've always done it."},"538":{"dur":1,"text":"And they do what's\ncalled a surge."},"539":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm sure if people\nhave heard about that."},"540":{"dur":1,"text":"It kind of worked in Iraq."},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"It worked in Europe\nin World War II."},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"It didn't work in Afghanistan."},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"And just, I remember\nseeing the process of that,"},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"how it's not going to work."},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"Didn't even explain it to the\nbosses before it happened."},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"We have the safe houses."},"556":{"dur":1,"text":"The locals like us."},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"We're shopping in the bazaars."},"559":{"dur":4,"text":"And they decided-- this is like\nbig military, big government."},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, let's get a base\nhere, build walls,"},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"and we'll pull everyone\nout of the city"},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"and you can live there."},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"And then the only\npeople driving outside"},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"will be the scared 20-year-old\nguy that's never been to war,"},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"so he's driving fast\nand hitting people."},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you want to shop,\nwe'll bring five vendors"},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"into the base and\nthen they can sell,"},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"but now they upped\ntheir prices by 800%."},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"These people get nothing."},"584":{"dur":1,"text":"They see that happening."},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"They're rich."},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"You sort of see\nwhat's happening."},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"You're going to become\nwhat's known as occupiers,"},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's how you get\nin a quagmire 2017."},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"So it was interesting\nto see both sides of it"},"596":{"dur":4,"text":"and actually kind of a\nbusiness-like team building"},"601":{"dur":4,"text":"and almost local leadership,\njust in a military aspect."},"605":{"dur":3,"text":"That's kind of where\nwe learned that."},"608":{"dur":0,"text":"SPEAKER: Cool."},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"ROB O'NEILL: That was\na long answer, sorry."},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"SPEAKER: So by late\n2000s you made it"},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"to senior chief\npetty officer, right?"},"616":{"dur":1,"text":"ROB O'NEILL: Mm hmm."},"617":{"dur":3,"text":"SPEAKER: Can you tell us what\nskills and leadership traits"},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"you feel like developed the\nmost from when you first"},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"got to the SEAL teams against\nwhen you were a senior chief?"},"625":{"dur":0,"text":"ROB O'NEILL: Yeah."},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"What developed the most--"},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"experience doesn't necessarily\ncome from a classroom."},"631":{"dur":1,"text":"It comes from on\nthe job training,"},"633":{"dur":3,"text":"and it comes from watching both\nyour peers and your superiors,"},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"how they're going to act."},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"And one thing that I noticed--"},"640":{"dur":1,"text":"I was on a lot of\ndifferent teams"},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"at a lot of different\ntimes, and the teams"},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"that performed at\nthe highest levels"},"646":{"dur":3,"text":"were teams that communicated,\nbut got along with each other."},"650":{"dur":1,"text":"And I remember watching\nbosses of mine."},"651":{"dur":1,"text":"They were so senior\nto me they didn't even"},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"need to acknowledge me, but they\nwould say good morning, please,"},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"and thank you for normal work."},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"Not all the time, but when it\nwas legitimate compliments just"},"661":{"dur":1,"text":"to make you feel like\nyou're part of the team."},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"And we noticed, when people\nwant to be where they're working"},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"and truly respect each other\nthat the team works harder."},"668":{"dur":1,"text":"So what we learned about it--"},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"one of my tactics\nwas I would, even"},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"if I had a decision made\nas one of the team leaders,"},"674":{"dur":3,"text":"I would always ask my people\nfor their input for two reasons."},"678":{"dur":4,"text":"One, they would maybe have\na better idea than I did."},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"But they also felt like\nthey're part of the solution."},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"So morale is high,\nand people skills"},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"is one of the major reason we\nwere a very successful team."},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"SPEAKER: I think a tricky\nthing to do sometimes"},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"is balance overplanning\nwith micromanagement."},"694":{"dur":0,"text":"ROB O'NEILL: Yes."},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"SPEAKER: The bin Laden raid,\nfrom what I read in the book,"},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"it seemed like every\ncontingency plan"},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"and every detail\nwas planned out."},"701":{"dur":0,"text":"ROB O'NEILL: Yes."},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"SPEAKER: How do you balance\nplanning a mission out"},"705":{"dur":3,"text":"with that much detail and not\nmicromanaging your people?"},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"ROB O'NEILL: The first\npart is, with the planning,"},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"the realization that the\nonly time the plan exists"},"713":{"dur":1,"text":"is while you're planning."},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"And then once you go to do it,\neverything is going to change."},"717":{"dur":1,"text":"It's the whole thing,\nthe only thing that's"},"719":{"dur":1,"text":"wrong is that nothing's wrong."},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"And anything that you do can get\nyou killed including nothing,"},"724":{"dur":1,"text":"if that makes any sense."},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"And then life, by the way, is\nwhat's happening around you"},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"as you're planning."},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"A prime example was\nthe bin Laden raid."},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"We had some of the\nbest military minds"},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"in the country\ncoming up with a plan"},"736":{"dur":1,"text":"because we knew\nwhat it looked like."},"738":{"dur":1,"text":"So we came up with\nthe perfect plan,"},"740":{"dur":1,"text":"and we rehearsed\nthe perfect plan."},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"Over and over, we trained with\nthe helicopters in the day,"},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"and then eat something,\nthen train at night."},"746":{"dur":3,"text":"And when we were done at 11:30,\nmidnight, or whatever, go back"},"749":{"dur":1,"text":"and we stand around a table--"},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"perfect model of the thing--\nand talk about the perfect"},"753":{"dur":1,"text":"plan till we're talking\nabout everything."},"755":{"dur":1,"text":"Then we came up with\nthe contingencies,"},"757":{"dur":1,"text":"tried to what if everything."},"759":{"dur":1,"text":"But we know the perfect\nplan is going to work."},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"And then one night we're\nstanding around very tired,"},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"and the boss said OK, what's the\nworst thing that could happen?"},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"And the youngest guy\nin the room said, well,"},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"the helicopter could\ncrash in the front yard."},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"And he pointed right\nthere, and everyone kind of"},"771":{"dur":1,"text":"looked at him like, you\ndon't want to jinx it."},"773":{"dur":1,"text":"Hey, negative."},"774":{"dur":0,"text":"Why would you say that?"},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"And he goes, I don't know, let's\ntalk about that for 30 seconds."},"777":{"dur":0,"text":"And we did."},"778":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's exactly\nwhat happened."},"779":{"dur":1,"text":"The helicopter\ncrashed, and none of us"},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"knew it except the\nguys that crashed."},"783":{"dur":0,"text":"But we didn't know."},"784":{"dur":1,"text":"We were in the other one."},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"But yeah, the\nmicromanagement

diving,\ndesert, jungle, all that stuff."},"2283":{"dur":1,"text":"And you just want to\nkeep care of your stuff"},"2285":{"dur":2,"text":"because you're going to need\na lot of different

in college."},"2371":{"dur":1,"text":"I played in college."},"2372":{"dur":3,"text":"And one of our rules\nis when my season"},"2375":{"dur":2,"text":"would end with whatever,\njunior high or high

we finish,"},"2384":{"dur":1,"text":"we don't get to\nleave until one of us"},"2386":{"dur":2,"text":"makes 20 free throws in a row."},"2388":{"dur":2,"text":"So it would start with a make,\nand then one guy rebounds."},"2390":{"dur":2,"text":"You start with a make, and\nthen you shoot until you miss."},"2392":{"dur":1,"text":"Then you switch."},"2394":{"dur":3,"text":"And so it was a 20 to\nleave the gym every day,"},"2397":{"dur":3,"text":"but then it was 20\nto get a steak dinner"},"2400":{"dur":2,"text":"at the Derby in Butte, Montana."},"2402":{"dur":2,"text":"But once you got the steak,\nthen it moved up by 25."},"2405":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's 20 to leave the\ngym, then 25 for a steak."},"2407":{"dur":2,"text":"Then it's 20 and\n30, then 35, 40."},"2409":{"dur":2,"text":"And we got to a point\nwhere my father,"},"2412":{"dur":2,"text":"I think he made\n92 in a row, which"},"2415":{"dur":3,"text":"was the family record for\na week because I made 105."},"2419":{"dur":1,"text":"But again, that's just\nthe way we learned."},"2421":{"dur":1,"text":"That's how we learned\nhow to shoot free"},"2423":{"dur":2,"text":"throws, how to shoot

that?"},"2470":{"dur":1,"text":"That's a good question, too."},"2472":{"dur":3,"text":"That's a tough one because\nthe realization is there."},"2476":{"dur":5,"text":"This mission was so high\nprofile

not."},"2510":{"dur":2,"text":"Because it got out, I was\naware right off the bat"},"2513":{"dur":2,"text":"that something bad could happen."},"2515":{"dur":3,"text":"I took a lot of

Sure."},"2648":{"dur":1,"text":"Next question."},"2650":{"dur":1,"text":"AUDIENCE: Part of being\nin the military means"},"2652":{"dur":3,"text":"that you get orders and you kind\nof just have to follow them."},"2655":{"dur":1,"text":"How do you reconcile\nthis with the kind"},"2657":{"dur":2,"text":"of you having your own\nopinions or not being"},"2659":{"dur":1,"text":"kind of in agreement
