was in this book."},"14":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm not going to be reading\nevery single excerpt from it,"},"18":{"dur":1,"text":"you'll be pleased to hear."},"19":{"dur":2,"text":"But I kept running\nout of colors."},"22":{"dur":4,"text":"So every page I was like,\nah, this is so interesting."},"26":{"dur":1,"text":"So, yeah."},"27":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean for me, having covered\nthese issues for so many years,"},"32":{"dur":2,"text":"this was an absolutely\nfascinating book for me to read"},"34":{"dur":5,"text":"because I think as a journalist\nyou, to a large extent,"},"40":{"dur":2,"text":"feel on the outside\nof all these issues."},"42":{"dur":1,"text":"And so for me it\nwas just wonderful,"},"44":{"dur":3,"text":"and you do it so well Christine,\nto have this story told"},"47":{"dur":2,"text":"from the inside of\nthe big corporations"},"49":{"dur":3,"text":"that I'm not normally ever\nallowed to go in and examine"},"52":{"dur":3,"text":"at that sort of level of depth."},"55":{"dur":4,"text":"And the other thing that\nyou did really well,"},"60":{"dur":1,"text":"as a corporate\nidealist you bring"},"61":{"dur":2,"text":"in all these other\ncorporate idealists"},"64":{"dur":2,"text":"sort of later in\nthe book as well."},"66":{"dur":3,"text":"And Christine's kind of\ncreated with the book"},"70":{"dur":3,"text":"a kind of amazing\ncommunity of people."},"73":{"dur":2,"text":"And for me it was really\nwonderful because actually,"},"75":{"dur":2,"text":"a lot of these people I've\ninterviewed over the years."},"78":{"dur":3,"text":"And it was wonderful to kind\nof reconnect with these people"},"81":{"dur":1,"text":"through your books."},"82":{"dur":0,"text":"So thank you for that."},"83":{"dur":1,"text":"CHRISTINE BADER: Oh good, Sarah."},"84":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, it was fun for me\ntoo to do all these interviews,"},"87":{"dur":1,"text":"because a lot of\nthem were people"},"89":{"dur":1,"text":"who I'd known for a long time."},"91":{"dur":2,"text":"Professionally we all go\nto the same conferences."},"93":{"dur":1,"text":"But I'd never actually\ngotten to talk to them"},"95":{"dur":4,"text":"about how they feel about\ntheir work and their ups"},"99":{"dur":3,"text":"and downs and their struggles,\nand when their company's just"},"103":{"dur":3,"text":"deeply disappointed them\nand what that was like."},"106":{"dur":1,"text":"So it was good fun for me too."},"107":{"dur":2,"text":"SARAH MURRAY: Well\non that point there's"},"110":{"dur":3,"text":"a really good line right at the\nbeginning that I'll just read,"},"113":{"dur":2,"text":"because it speaks very\nmuch to that point."},"116":{"dur":2,"text":"This is in the\nintroduction and Christine"},"118":{"dur":1,"text":"writes, \"We believe\nthat business"},"120":{"dur":2,"text":"can be a force for good\neven as we struggle"},"122":{"dur":1,"text":"with our own contradictions.\""},"124":{"dur":3,"text":"I think that's a theme that\nruns through the whole book"},"128":{"dur":4,"text":"and is very\npowerfully expressed."},"132":{"dur":2,"text":"But I thought I'd start by,\nlet's go back to the beginning."},"135":{"dur":2,"text":"Because you describe\nyour relationship"},"137":{"dur":3,"text":"with BP and the corporate world\nas something of a love affair."},"141":{"dur":2,"text":"And of course, it\nwas a love affair"},"143":{"dur":1,"text":"that was going to\nsort of fall apart"},"145":{"dur":5,"text":"after the Deepwater\nHorizon took place."},"150":{"dur":3,"text":"So just tell us how that\nlove affair started."},"153":{"dur":3,"text":"What was the spark that made\nyou think that, gosh, business"},"156":{"dur":2,"text":"might actually be a force\nfor good in the world?"},"159":{"dur":0,"text":"CHRISTINE BADER: Right."},"160":{"dur":0,"text":"OK, that's good, Sarah."},"161":{"dur":1,"text":"That's a good place to start."},"163":{"dur":3,"text":"So I had done nonprofit\nand government work"},"166":{"dur":2,"text":"and then decided to go\nto business school, first"},"169":{"dur":2,"text":"of all like every good\nliberal arts graduate."},"171":{"dur":2,"text":"But then also I realized\nthat in these jobs"},"174":{"dur":3,"text":"I seem to be reacting to things\nthat the private sector had"},"178":{"dur":0,"text":"done."},"179":{"dur":2,"text":"So when I was doing\ncommunity service, when"},"181":{"dur":2,"text":"I was working in the New\nYork City mayor's office,"},"184":{"dur":1,"text":"we were reacting\nto the conditions"},"185":{"dur":1,"text":"that business had created."},"187":{"dur":2,"text":"So I was serving\nin communities that"},"189":{"dur":3,"text":"had been devastated when\ncompanies had moved out"},"193":{"dur":2,"text":"or they had actively\ndone things bad,"},"196":{"dur":4,"text":"like they had lobbied to replace\na public garden with a parking"},"200":{"dur":2,"text":"Or they had moved into\nan area and failed"},"203":{"dur":2,"text":"to hire anybody from that city."},"206":{"dur":2,"text":"And then in the mayor's\noffice, on the flip side,"},"208":{"dur":3,"text":"companies were wooed for\nthe jobs and for the revenue"},"211":{"dur":1,"text":"that they bring in."},"212":{"dur":2,"text":"And so there was always this\nsort of balance of OK, well,"},"215":{"dur":1,"text":"we clearly need to\nregulate business"},"217":{"dur":2,"text":"but we want to encourage them."},"219":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's why I chose\nto go to business school"},"221":{"dur":0,"text":"because I thought, OK."},"222":{"dur":2,"text":"Business actually seems to be\npretty important in the world."},"225":{"dur":2,"text":"I should learn something\nabout the private sector."},"227":{"dur":0,"text":"So I went."},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"But of course I had no\nidea what I wanted to do."},"231":{"dur":3,"text":"Did any of you go\nto business school?"},"235":{"dur":0,"text":"Yeah."},"236":{"dur":3,"text":"And so you get there\nand people immediately"},"239":{"dur":2,"text":"start asking you to throw\nyour resumes in for investment"},"241":{"dur":1,"text":"banking or consulting\ninterviews."},"243":{"dur":1,"text":"And you get there and you're\nlike, I don't know what this is"},"244":{"dur":1,"text":"and I haven't\nlearned anything new."},"246":{"dur":2,"text":"So I started to follow\nthe herd and do that."},"249":{"dur":4,"text":"But then John Browne, who at\nthe time was the CEO of BP,"},"253":{"dur":1,"text":"came to speak at Yale."},"254":{"dur":3,"text":"And he had recently become the\nfirst head of a major energy"},"257":{"dur":3,"text":"company to acknowledge the\nrealities of climate change"},"261":{"dur":1,"text":"and urge action."},"262":{"dur":5,"text":"And he was a really inspiring\nand thoughtful leader."},"267":{"dur":2,"text":"And I thought, oh."},"270":{"dur":1,"text":"This is what business can do."},"271":{"dur":2,"text":"That is intriguing to me."},"274":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's why I joined,\nbecause of this leader who"},"277":{"dur":2,"text":"seemed to be a different\nkind of oil man,"},"279":{"dur":3,"text":"trying to create a different\nkind of energy company."},"282":{"dur":1,"text":"And it was really intriguing."},"284":{"dur":3,"text":"So I joined and I went\nstraight out to Indonesia."},"287":{"dur":3,"text":"And the thing that turned\nout to be my job in Indonesia"},"291":{"dur":4,"text":"and China was investing in the\ncommunities living near big BP"},"295":{"dur":1,"text":"projects."},"297":{"dur":2,"text":"Because everybody\nwho I worked with"},"299":{"dur":2,"text":"realized that what was\ngood for those communities"},"301":{"dur":1,"text":"was good for our business."},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"There were lots of\nother terrible examples"},"305":{"dur":3,"text":"around the world of where\ncommunity relations have gone"},"309":{"dur":3,"text":"sour and communities\nhave blockaded access"},"312":{"dur":3,"text":"roads to mines, they've\nsabotaged equipment."},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"So people seem to\nunderstand that"},"318":{"dur":1,"text":"what was good for\nthem was good for us."},"320":{"dur":1,"text":"And that was my job."},"321":{"dur":3,"text":"So I was living this cliche\nof doing well and doing good."},"325":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, what's not to love?"},"326":{"dur":2,"text":"SARAH MURRAY: And was this\nsomething that came up"},"329":{"dur":1,"text":"when you were at\nbusiness school?"},"330":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, were these\nkinds of issues--"},"332":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean, I know now business\nschools have been piling"},"337":{"dur":1,"text":"on the courses about\nsort of sustainability"},"338":{"dur":1,"text":"and corporate responsibility."},"340":{"dur":3,"text":"But back then was that\nsomething that was covered?"},"343":{"dur":1,"text":"CHRISTINE BADER: Yeah,\nnot specifically."},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, I chose to go to\nYale for business school"},"347":{"dur":1,"text":"because its mission\nhas always been"},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"to educate leaders for\nbusiness and society."},"350":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's always been this\nsort of ethos there of, yes."},"354":{"dur":4,"text":"We go there in order to do some\nsort of service to the world."},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"And people who go\nthere choose to do it"},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"through business or\nworking with business."},"363":{"dur":0,"text":"But no."},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"At the time there weren't sort\nof corporate responsibility"},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"jobs or sustainability jobs."},"368":{"dur":0,"text":"SARAH MURRAY: Right."},"369":{"dur":0,"text":"Right."},"370":{"dur":5,"text":"But then now, so you've\nsort of met-- well,"},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"not met John Browne,\nbut seen him speak"},"378":{"dur":1,"text":"and kind of bought\ninto this idea"},"379":{"dur":1,"text":"that BP could be\na force for good."},"381":{"dur":3,"text":"And then you're in\na helicopter flying"},"384":{"dur":3,"text":"over the jungles of Indonesia."},"388":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, what is going through\nyour head at that point?"},"390":{"dur":0,"text":"CHRISTINE BADER: Right."},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"So I went out to Indonesia."},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"I spent my summer internship\nbetween my two years"},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"of business school in\nLondon headquarters,"},"398":{"dur":3,"text":"and then my first assignment\nwith BP was out in Indonesia."},"401":{"dur":3,"text":"But again, this\nwasn't a CSR job."},"405":{"dur":1,"text":"I was supposed to be a\ncommercial analyst using"},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"my new spreadsheet skills."},"409":{"dur":3,"text":"And BP had just taken over\nARCO, the American oil company."},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"And so I was there."},"415":{"dur":3,"text":"A lot of the ARCO\nstuff was in Indonesia."},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"So I was analyzing\nthose projects."},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"There were lots of different\noil fields, gas fields."},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"There was some coal,\nsome solar, chemicals."},"427":{"dur":1,"text":"What should it spin off?"},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"What should it do\nwith all this stuff?"},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"So I was just crunching\nnumbers and doing spreadsheets"},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"because that's what\nyou do when you've"},"435":{"dur":1,"text":"graduated from business school."},"436":{"dur":2,"text":"I didn't know that\nthis was a job."},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"But one of those\nprojects was proving"},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"particularly\ninteresting, and not"},"444":{"dur":1,"text":"from a technical point of view."},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"From a technical point of view\nit was very straightforward."},"448":{"dur":4,"text":"So there was a big gas field and\nBP was going to build a plant,"},"452":{"dur":4,"text":"a liquefied natural gas LNG\nplant to process the gas."},"457":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's pretty\nstraightforward."},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"BP's done that all\nover the world."},"461":{"dur":4,"text":"But never in a place\nlike this where"},"465":{"dur":3,"text":"we were going to have to work\nwith the Indonesian military,"},"468":{"dur":4,"text":"which is not known for their\ngood community relations."},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"And a village was\ngoing to have to be"},"475":{"dur":1,"text":"moved to make way for the plant."},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"It was 127 families."},"480":{"dur":1,"text":"SARAH MURRAY: Not to\nmention the forest"},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"that you were flying over."},"483":{"dur":1,"text":"CHRISTINE BADER: Exactly."},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"So my first trip\nout there, yeah."},"487":{"dur":3,"text":"And I was living in Jakarta\nin Indonesia's capital."},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"And so to get out\nto West Papua I"},"492":{"dur":3,"text":"had to take an overnight\ncommercial flight and then"},"495":{"dur":3,"text":"a little seaplane-- it was\nlike a twelve seater plane--"},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"another hour and a half,\nand then a helicopter"},"501":{"dur":1,"text":"the rest of the way in."},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"So on that last\nleg of the journey"},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"there's this really\ndense rainforest"},"507":{"dur":3,"text":"through flocks of birds\nbursting through the trees."},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"Not a lot of people."},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"And as we started\nto get closer I"},"514":{"dur":4,"text":"could see the rig on\nthe horizon in the bay."},"518":{"dur":1,"text":"And as we're coming\nin, I could just"},"520":{"dur":5,"text":"see our landing pad and then\nthe dormitories for the workers"},"525":{"dur":1,"text":"there."},"526":{"dur":1,"text":"And we're on the equator."},"528":{"dur":0,"text":"It was pretty hot."},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"I had never been in\na helicopter before."},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"This was pretty exciting."},"532":{"dur":7,"text":"But I was starting to get\nreally sweaty and uncomfortable."},"539":{"dur":3,"text":"And I realized that\nI was envisioning"},"542":{"dur":2,"text":"the sketches of what the\nplant was going to look like."},"545":{"dur":4,"text":"And it was this gleaming, modern\nindustrial complex and imposing"},"550":{"dur":3,"text":"it on this not totally pristine,\nbut relatively pristine"},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"rainforest."},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"And I started to get really ill."},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"I just thought for\nthe first time, oh."},"561":{"dur":2,"text":"This is what we do."},"563":{"dur":1,"text":"SARAH MURRAY: Not\nsomething they prepare you"},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"for at business school."},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"CHRISTINE BADER: No, I mean,\nI understand conceptually."},"568":{"dur":4,"text":"We keep the lights on and we\nhelp keep the cars moving."},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"But that's when\nit really hit me."},"575":{"dur":0,"text":"And so we landed."},"576":{"dur":1,"text":"And you can't really\ntalk in a helicopter"},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"because it's pretty loud."},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"But I was there with one\nof the vice presidents"},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"for environmental policy,\nand she immediately"},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"saw the distress on my face."},"587":{"dur":3,"text":"And she said, that's\nwhy we're here."},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"We're going to get this right."},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"SARAH MURRAY: Now what does\ngetting it right it mean?"},"595":{"dur":4,"text":"Because I mean, I\nthink it would be"},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"interesting to talk a little bit\nabout perceptions of business"},"603":{"dur":1,"text":"and how business\noperates and what"},"604":{"dur":1,"text":"the realities are on the ground."},"606":{"dur":3,"text":"Because I certainly get a\nsense often in the people"},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"that I talk to that aren't\nin the business world,"},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"that they think,\nwell, business is"},"613":{"dur":4,"text":"just this evil empire that comes\nin and lands, and that's it."},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"And the reality on the\nground and the things"},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"that you were then\ngoing to deal with"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"is sort of complex and messy."},"624":{"dur":4,"text":"And how much of that is the\ncompany's responsibility,"},"629":{"dur":4,"text":"and how much are you dealing\nwith the existing environment"},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"and having to sort of\nnegotiate all these"},"635":{"dur":2,"text":"very complex trade offs?"},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"CHRISTINE BADER: Yeah,\nthat's exactly the question,"},"640":{"dur":3,"text":"and this company knows\nthat as well as anyone."},"644":{"dur":3,"text":"And we can get into\nthat certainly as well."},"647":{"dur":6,"text":"So I guess the first fundamental\nmacro concept is the point"},"653":{"dur":4,"text":"that energy does\nkeep the lights on"},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"and it helps enable\nthe lifestyles that we"},"660":{"dur":1,"text":"want to lead."},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I suppose\nthere are plenty"},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"of people who want to try to\nstop globalization and stop"},"667":{"dur":1,"text":"development altogether."},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's fine."},"670":{"dur":4,"text":"There should be some\npeople who want to do that."},"674":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, I can get a little bit\nsnarky with them and ask well,"},"678":{"dur":4,"text":"who keeps your lights on and\nhow did you get here today,"},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"and what made that possible?"},"685":{"dur":2,"text":"SARAH MURRAY: We live part\nof the corporate world"},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"as consumers and\nindividuals, don't we?"},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"CHRISTINE BADER: Exactly."},"691":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, one thing that\nI do once in awhile"},"692":{"dur":3,"text":"is just a little game, which I\ninvite you all to play with me."},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"But just stop and take\nan inventory, right?"},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"I just stop and say, OK."},"699":{"dur":4,"text":"Head to toe, what am I wearing\nright now and what's in my bag?"},"704":{"dur":4,"text":"And how many companies\nor brands have I"},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"interacted with since\nI woke up this morning?"},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"So I've got a coffee maker\nand I've got my alarm clock,"},"713":{"dur":3,"text":"and I woke up in my sheets that\nwere made here and bought here."},"716":{"dur":1,"text":"And I just go through, OK."},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, what do I know\nabout these companies?"},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"And where does\nthat put me on the"},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"responsible to\noverconsumption spectrum?"},"724":{"dur":0,"text":"SARAH MURRAY: Right."},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think what's interesting,\nand this is particularly true,"},"728":{"dur":1,"text":"I guess, of sort of\napparel industries"},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"and food which have very\ncomplex supply chains."},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"But even with energy\nyou turn the lights on"},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"and you don't think about\nthat Indonesian villager that"},"738":{"dur":6,"text":"had to move to another\nvillage or to a new village."},"744":{"dur":4,"text":"What were the real on\nthe ground challenges"},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"that you didn't expect and that\ncertainly business school might"},"751":{"dur":1,"text":"not have prepared you for?"},"752":{"dur":0,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"753":{"dur":1,"text":"SARAH MURRAY: Some of\nthe sort of nitty gritty."},"755":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, I think\nthere was something"},"758":{"dur":3,"text":"you mentioned about the\nfact that this was really"},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"interesting to me,\nthat you made it"},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"so that the workers did\nnot get paid on site."},"767":{"dur":0,"text":"CHRISTINE BADER: Yeah."},"768":{"dur":1,"text":"SARAH MURRAY: That\nfor me reflected"},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"a lot of the\ncomplexities that you're"},"771":{"dur":0,"text":"dealing with on the ground."},"772":{"dur":0,"text":"So perhaps just explain that."},"773":{"dur":1,"text":"CHRISTINE BADER: Sure,\nI can explain that."},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"So we were building this big\nplant in a really remote area."},"778":{"dur":5,"text":"There was one village there\nbut no other cities nearby."},"783":{"dur":3,"text":"So we stipulated in the contract\nwith the construction company"},"786":{"dur":3,"text":"that they would not hire\nor pay people on the site."},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"They would only do that in\none of the three existing"},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"towns that were a\nlittle ways away."},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"The reason is that if you\nlet it be known that you're"},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"going to be hiring\npeople right at the site,"},"799":{"dur":3,"text":"people move right\nup to the fence."},"803":{"dur":2,"text":"And then they usually, if\nthey can't get a job because"},"806":{"dur":1,"text":"there aren't that\nmany jobs, than they"},"807":{"dur":1,"text":"tap into the electricity."},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"They stay there\nbecause they've moved."},"811":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's how\nshantytowns pop up."},"813":{"dur":3,"text":"And then idol hands, right?"},"817":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's how bad things\narise, because then also,"},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"if you pay people\non site, imagine"},"823":{"dur":2,"text":"if somebody's done\na three week shift"},"825":{"dur":1,"text":"and then they stand there."},"827":{"dur":1,"text":"They walk out of a\nplant and you hand them"},"828":{"dur":1,"text":"three weeks worth\nof cash, and they're"},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"not home with\ntheir families yet."},"833":{"dur":2,"text":"You might imagine what pops up."},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"So then brothels pop up."},"838":{"dur":3,"text":"Sort of ad hoc gambling\nparlors pop up."},"842":{"dur":1,"text":"And then what happens,\nthen the police"},"843":{"dur":2,"text":"feel like they need to\nmove in for protection,"},"846":{"dur":1,"text":"but they're actually\ntaking their cut."},"848":{"dur":2,"text":"And then the military\nstep up their presence"},"850":{"dur":1,"text":"because they're\nlike, wait a second."},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"The police are getting in\non all the action, right?"},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can see how these\nthings start to compound."},"857":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's why we didn't\nwant to hire [INAUDIBLE]."},"860":{"dur":1,"text":"SARAH MURRAY: It's really\nso complex, isn't it?"},"862":{"dur":2,"text":"For so many industries."},"865":{"dur":1,"text":"One of the things\nI thought would"},"866":{"dur":3,"text":"be interesting to ask you about\nwas where you see-- you talk"},"869":{"dur":3,"text":"a lot in the book about\nCSR and later we'll"},"872":{"dur":3,"text":"talk a little bit about\nsort of careers in CSR"},"876":{"dur":2,"text":"and how you move into that."},"878":{"dur":2,"text":"Personally I hate the term CSR."},"880":{"dur":0,"text":"I don't know about you."},"881":{"dur":2,"text":"Because I think it sort\nof silos these things"},"883":{"dur":2,"text":"into some kind of acronym\nthat half the world"},"885":{"dur":2,"text":"doesn't know what\nthat means anyway."},"887":{"dur":2,"text":"So where do you see the balance?"},"890":{"dur":3,"text":"A lot of companies will talk\nabout their sustainability"},"894":{"dur":2,"text":"program or their business\nresponsibility program."},"896":{"dur":1,"text":"And then you find\nthat they're talking"},"897":{"dur":4,"text":"about changing the light bulbs\nin the office or recycling"},"901":{"dur":1,"text":"things."},"903":{"dur":3,"text":"What you've just described\non the ground in Indonesia,"},"906":{"dur":2,"text":"to me that's corporate\nresponsibility."},"909":{"dur":3,"text":"How do you see that sort\nof view in business,"},"913":{"dur":1,"text":"that attitude having shifted?"},"914":{"dur":1,"text":"Or has it

my second\nreaction was, or was it?"},"1672":{"dur":3,"text":"So I started talking\nto friends who've"},"1675":{"dur":2,"text":"been doing similar work\ndeep inside big

optimism"},"2857":{"dur":2,"text":"of people who are\ndoing this work."},"2862":{"dur":2,"text":"So one friend who's\nworked in supply chains"},"2865":{"dur":4,"text":"for a number of

machines."},"2888":{"dur":1,"text":"And it was horrible."},"2890":{"dur":3,"text":"And I said, well, what did\nthat feel like to see that?"},"2893":{"dur":3,"text":"And he said, well,\nhe said, it

to Papau New Guinea\non his first day of work"},"2928":{"dur":5,"text":"and saw the extent of\ndomestic violence there."},"2933":{"dur":2,"text":"And was trying to\nthink about,

what\nyou're stepping into?"},"2948":{"dur":2,"text":"And he said, I thought\nthis was an opportunity"},"2951":{"dur":1,"text":"to do really good\nhuman rights work,"},"2953":{"dur":2,"text":"that this is a place\nwhere we could actually"},"2956":{"dur":1,"text":"make a difference."},"2957":{"dur":0,"text":"So yeah."},"2958":{"dur":1,"text":"It's incredibly disheartening."},"2959":{"dur":1,"text":"But what are you\ngoing to do about it?"},"2961":{"dur":1,"text":"Are you going to do nothing?"},"2962":{"dur":1,"text":"Like, we've all got\nto do something."},"2963":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's just,\nwhat is ours to do?"},"2966":{"dur":2,"text":"SARAH MURRAY: And different\npeople have different roles."},"2968":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, I think even\nwithin the NGO community,"},"2971":{"dur":2,"text":"I was talking to somebody\nfrom Greenpeace the other day."},"2974":{"dur":3,"text":"And he was saying, we\npave the way for the

here."},"3002":{"dur":4,"text":"So one thing that really\nstruck me about your book"},"3007":{"dur":3,"text":"was this feeling\nof being isolated"},"3010":{"dur":3,"text":"as a corporate idealist\nin a massive company."},"3014":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was wondering\nif you could speak"},"3017":{"dur":3,"text":"about creating a culture\nof accountability"},"3021":{"dur":5,"text":"in a huge company\nsuch as Google or BP."},"3026":{"dur":3,"text":"The supply chain\nis just so massive."},"3030":{"dur":3,"text":"So for the Gap example that\nyou presented about the sub"},"3034":{"dur":2,"text":"subcontractor hiring\nthese laborers as opposed"},"3037":{"dur":3,"text":"to corporate has that\nGap saying let's hire."},"3043":{"dur":1,"text":"How do you manage\nfor accountability"},"3045":{"dur":3,"text":"in these huge supply\nchains and also,"},"3049":{"dur":3,"text":"if you could speak about your\nexperience at BP or elsewhere,"},"3052":{"dur":4,"text":"just creating that culture of\naccountability among people?"},"3056":{"dur":2,"text":"CHRISTINE BADER:\nAnd by that, do you"},"3058":{"dur":5,"text":"mean a culture of taking\nresponsibility for those issues"},"3064":{"dur":2,"text":"that previously somebody might\nhave said that's not our--"},"3067":{"dur":2,"text":"AUDIENCE: Right.\n[INAUDIBLE] subcontractors"},"3069":{"dur":2,"text":"because it's no\nlonger in our hands."},"3072":{"dur":0,"text":"CHRISTINE BADER: Yeah."},"3073":{"dur":2,"text":"That's a great question."},"3076":{"dur":2,"text":"Let me think to\nmy own experience."},"3079":{"dur":3,"text":"Again, I guess so\nin China it was"},"3083":{"dur":4,"text":"about trying to make\nthe case that we"},"3087":{"dur":3,"text":"are accountable for those issues\nwhether we like it or not."},"3091":{"dur":5,"text":"And I think that's been\na big theme in this field"},"3097":{"dur":2,"text":"for a long time of companies."},"3099":{"dur":2,"text":"Every company's sort of\ngoing through this journey."},"3101":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's like the seven\nstages of grieving, right?"},"3105":{"dur":2,"text":"Or that first there's\nthis denial, right?"},"3107":{"dur":1,"text":"And we saw this with\nNike with sweatshops"},"3109":{"dur":2,"text":"and we saw it with\nShell in Nigeria."},"3112":{"dur":2,"text":"And we even saw it, I\nthink, with censorship"},"3114":{"dur":3,"text":"when the first wave sort of hit\nthis industry and these cases"},"3117":{"dur":4,"text":"coming to the fore of companies\nsaying, not my responsibility."},"3121":{"dur":3,"text":"That somebody else's\nresponsibility."},"3124":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I think realizing,\nit's like, you know what?"},"3126":{"dur":1,"text":"That's not good enough."},"3128":{"dur":2,"text":"And whether or not legally\nthis is your responsibility,"},"3131":{"dur":1,"text":"the court of public\nopinion believes"},"3132":{"dur":3,"text":"that it's your responsibility."},"3135":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think a lot of companies\nstarted taking responsibility"},"3138":{"dur":5,"text":"because they realized,\nwell, I guess it is now."},"3144":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think there are a few\nfactors that make that happen."},"3147":{"dur":3,"text":"One of them is\nexternal pressure."},"3150":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we saw this with Apple\nwhen the big \"New York Times\""},"3154":{"dur":2,"text":"expose came out about\nworking conditions"},"3156":{"dur":1,"text":"in Foxconn factories."},"3158":{"dur":1,"text":"And at first Apple\nsort of demurred."},"3160":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, they've been working\non supply chain responsibility"},"3163":{"dur":0,"text":"This wasn't new."},"3164":{"dur":3,"text":"But we really saw them\nstep up after there"},"3167":{"dur":2,"text":"was so much public pressure\nand join the Fair Labor"},"3170":{"dur":3,"text":"Which is a big deal for\nApple in particular, right?"},"3174":{"dur":2,"text":"To have third party\nauditors come in"},"3176":{"dur":3,"text":"and inspect their\nsupplier factories."},"3180":{"dur":3,"text":"And actually for Google to join\nthe Global Network Initiative,"},"3183":{"dur":4,"text":"that's a huge step because that\nrequires third party auditors"},"3188":{"dur":1,"text":"to come in and look\nat your processes."},"3190":{"dur":2,"text":"And you guys know\nbetter than anybody."},"3192":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, do you let\nanybody in here"},"3194":{"dur":1,"text":"to poke around\nand look at stuff?"},"3196":{"dur":1,"text":"Like, that's\nactually a big deal."},"3198":{"dur":3,"text":"But I think that your company's\nleadership realized, because"},"3201":{"dur":2,"text":"of what enough of you were\nsaying also inside the company."},"3204":{"dur":3,"text":"And be like, hey, we need\nto step up our game here"},"3207":{"dur":3,"text":"if we're really going\nto live out our values"},"3210":{"dur":2,"text":"and take responsibility\nfor what we're doing"},"3213":{"dur":4,"text":"and be the most trusted\ncompany for people."},"3217":{"dur":1,"text":"This is what we need to do."},"3218":{"dur":2,"text":"So again, I think\nin every company"},"3220":{"dur":3,"text":"there are going to be different\ndrivers and pressures that"},"3223":{"dur":2,"text":"will create that culture."},"3225":{"dur":2,"text":"But I think in all of\nthose cases a lot of it"},"3228":{"dur":3,"text":"will come from within,\nof people saying, folks,"},"3231":{"dur":1,"text":"this is simply\nwhat we need to do."},"3233":{"dur":1,"text":"But I think it's different\nin every company."},"3235":{"dur":1,"text":"SARAH MURRAY: And\nI think there are"},"3236":{"dur":2,"text":"a lot of-- I mean,\nshareholders for a start,"},"3239":{"dur":1,"text":"are starting, in\nsome cases, starting"},"3241":{"dur":4,"text":"to push the companies that\nthey own into disclosure."},"3245":{"dur":3,"text":"And then you have the power\nof a company like Walmart"},"3249":{"dur":2,"text":"that can say, well,\nlook here suppliers."},"3251":{"dur":2,"text":"You've all got to meet certain\nenvironmental standards as"},"3253":{"dur":1,"text":"if you're actually\ngoing to sell to us."},"3255":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think there's a\nrange of pressures."},"3258":{"dur":0,"text":"But you're right."},"3259":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, the internal is a\nvery important one as well."},"3262":{"dur":1,"text":"I think we might have\ntime for one
