serve them, kind of at the same time,"},"432":{"dur":4,"text":"where hamantaschen, you\ncook them the day before."},"437":{"dur":1,"text":"- So there's a separation of the sensory"},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"experiences, is what you're saying."},"441":{"dur":1,"text":"- Right, right."},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"- Have you worked at all\nwith rats on this question"},"445":{"dur":3,"text":"of how they experience that separation?"},"448":{"dur":4,"text":"- We do, actually, we train\nthem to recognize an odor,"},"452":{"dur":4,"text":"like it could be just a\nlatke odor and then test them"},"457":{"dur":3,"text":"the next day on whether or\nnot they recognize that."},"460":{"dur":4,"text":"In the context of having eaten\nsomething quite rewarding,"},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"in the case of the rats, it's sugar,"},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"but for humans it could\nbe a delicious latke."},"472":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Host] Let me just get this\nstraight, from the series"},"474":{"dur":4,"text":"of questions I've asked\nyou, I would deduce"},"478":{"dur":3,"text":"that you feel that latkes\nare more beneficial"},"482":{"dur":3,"text":"to rats than hamantaschen\nare, is that correct?"},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"- [Leslie] Yeah, yeah, I\nmean it's a richer sensory"},"489":{"dur":4,"text":"experience, I think, and so\nmore pleasurable and better."},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"- Well I don't know if\nthat's an endorsement,"},"496":{"dur":1,"text":"but it's a vote for\nlatkes from the

that\nwell to ask that question,"},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"but in any case, what I wanna talk about"},"553":{"dur":4,"text":"is more derivative from\nLevi-Strauss when we come to

called the\nAbominations of Leviticus,"},"579":{"dur":4,"text":"it's in her book \"Purity\nand Danger\" and I think"},"584":{"dur":3,"text":"it's relevant to the\nhamantash latke

please."},"594":{"dur":3,"text":"- You know that hamantash is a triangle"},"600":{"dur":3,"text":"and the latke is a kind of a round circle."},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"Now any anthropologist would\nknow that we're dealing"},"608":{"dur":3,"text":"with a fundamental kinship convention"},"612":{"dur":4,"text":"where triangles are male\nand circles are female,"},"617":{"dur":3,"text":"so we can call this hamantash and latke"},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"and why don't we do things\nlike this, so this would be"},"624":{"dur":3,"text":"a marriage between them and this would be,"},"627":{"dur":4,"text":"well actually, there's\nsomething going on here,"},"632":{"dur":4,"text":"their offspring, an\noffspring that immediately"},"636":{"dur":4,"text":"calls into

here,"},"653":{"dur":4,"text":"this is clearly a mis-alliance\nin the Jewish tradition,"},"659":{"dur":3,"text":"and one of two things in that case,"},"662":{"dur":3,"text":"either it's too distant,\nthat it's like a marriage"},"665":{"dur":3,"text":"with a gentile, or it's\ntoo close, it's incest."},"672":{"dur":4,"text":"It's unlikely to be incest,\nfor a couple of reasons."},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"One is that the partners\nare too different,"},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"they couldn't be very\nmuch from the same family,"},"690":{"dur":3,"text":"since one is baked and the other is fried,"},"693":{"dur":3,"text":"one is triangular, the other is round,"},"696":{"dur":4,"text":"one is sweet and the\nother is salty and so on."},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"So the chances are that one of these"},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"two people is a gentile."},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"- How do we know which one?\n- How do we know which one?"},"711":{"dur":1,"text":"- And is that a bad thing or a good thing?"},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"- Now we have to find out which one."},"714":{"dur":4,"text":"I think it's easy, pretty easy,\nfirst of all haman-taschen."},"719":{"dur":4,"text":"Haman by the other Equinacto\ncalendar of Soledad,"},"726":{"dur":4,"text":"Purim is obviously an\nenemy, haman, hamantaschen,"},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"is

Purim,"},"769":{"dur":4,"text":"but latke I think is a\npreferred food in many ways."},"773":{"dur":4,"text":"- I wanna thank you for\nrepresenting a field of

Yes."},"854":{"dur":2,"text":"- So my question to you\nis, could you quantify,"},"856":{"dur":2,"text":"since you've shown us\nthat the nutritional value"},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"of hamantaschen is
