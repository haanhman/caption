deal."},"645":{"dur":3,"text":"So you say, \"Well, Ed, well, Ed, what's the---I\nmean, you come, you come into our house and"},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"you criticize it?"},"650":{"dur":1,"text":"What are we supposed to do?"},"651":{"dur":1,"text":"Do you have an alternative?\""},"652":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, no, I don't have an alternative."},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"I just wanted to complain about
