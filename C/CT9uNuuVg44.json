yourself\npresented as this really."},"106":{"dur":2,"text":"So if I present a\nclinical case to you all,"},"108":{"dur":2,"text":"it's of a 34-year-old male."},"111":{"dur":1,"text":"He describes himself\nas fit and well,"},"113":{"dur":2,"text":"though you may argue\notherwise if you knew the chap."},"116":{"dur":1,"text":"He's got no significant\nmedical history."},"117":{"dur":2,"text":"He

look at him, and\nwe like to look at people,"},"130":{"dur":2,"text":"we do this A, B, C that\nyou may have heard about,"},"133":{"dur":1,"text":"he's chatting fine."},"134":{"dur":1,"text":"His airway's OK."},"136":{"dur":3,"text":"His [inaudible] which he's\nbreathing is 60 breaths"},"140":{"dur":0,"text":"per minutes."},"141":{"dur":1,"text":"A normal breathing\nrate's about 12."},"143":{"dur":1,"text":"So he's really panting."},"145":{"dur":3,"text":"His oxygen saturation is when we\nmeasure how much oxygen he's got"},"148":{"dur":2,"text":"in his blood should be\naround 99 or 100 percent,"},"151":{"dur":4,"text":"is about 34 percent, and his\nheart rate is double the normal."},"155":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's as if he's just\nbeen sprinting 100

15 out of 15."},"166":{"dur":2,"text":"So he's fully lucid,\nchatting, coherent, and happy,"},"169":{"dur":2,"text":"but his numbers are\nreally, really odd."},"171":{"dur":2,"text":"And now in hospital, if\nhe were to go to ANE,"},"174":{"dur":2,"text":"and you were very unwell,\nand you had a chest infection"},"177":{"dur":1,"text":"or something, and you had a\nchest infection or something,"},"179":{"dur":2,"text":"and you had numbers anywhere\nnear this, or even half of that"},"181":{"dur":3,"text":"as these were, as a doctor would\ntake some blood from your wrist,"},"185":{"dur":2,"text":"and look at how oxygenated\nthat blood is,"},"188":{"dur":2,"text":"and we measure the\noxygen in that blood."},"191":{"dur":2,"text":"So if were to take some oxygen\nfrom anyone in this room,"},"193":{"dur":1,"text":"some blood, and measured\nthe oxygen levels,"},"195":{"dur":2,"text":"the number would be\nabout 15 kilopascals."},"197":{"dur":1,"text":"I think the number 15."},"199":{"dur":4,"text":"If we do that in ANE, and\na patient has a blood level"},"203":{"dur":2,"text":"of about 8, we really\nget worried,"},"206":{"dur":1,"text":"and we'll call the\nintensive care doctors,"},"208":{"dur":2,"text":"and they'll contemplate putting\nthis person into an induced coma"},"211":{"dur":1,"text":"and putting them on a ventilator"},"212":{"dur":3,"text":"because 8 is a worryingly\nlow number for oxygenation."},"216":{"dur":3,"text":"So this chap, we did\na blood gas on him,"},"219":{"dur":3,"text":"and his numbers were 2.55."},"223":{"dur":2,"text":"So that is very, very\nlow, and, in fact,"},"226":{"dur":2,"text":"I've never ever seen an oxygen\nlevel anywhere near that."},"228":{"dur":3,"text":"Anywhere even near 5\nin hospital setting,"},"232":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's actually the\nlowest number ever recorded"},"235":{"dur":2,"text":"for a blood oxygen\nlevel in a live patient."},"237":{"dur":3,"text":"And he's very proud if\nyou ever meet this person."},"241":{"dur":1,"text":"So where did we meet\nthis person?"},"242":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, this is where I work"},"244":{"dur":2,"text":"on a day-to-day basis,\nand it wasn't here."},"247":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, if it had been here,\nI would have been extremely,"},"249":{"dur":1,"text":"extremely, extremely worried."},"250":{"dur":3,"text":"I'd be very worried, indeed,\nbut it was, in fact, here."},"254":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is Mount Everest."},"256":{"dur":2,"text":"It's covered with this\nominous-looking [inaudible] form"},"258":{"dur":3,"text":"cloud on top of it, and if you\nlook at the screen to the right,"},"261":{"dur":1,"text":"you can almost see\na little balcony,"},"263":{"dur":2,"text":"and the chap we've just\ndescribed had just been"},"266":{"dur":1,"text":"up to summit, and\nhad just decided"},"268":{"dur":2,"text":"to stroll down the mountain."},"270":{"dur":1,"text":"On his way down, they\nput up a little tent,"},"272":{"dur":3,"text":"and they thought it would be a\ngood idea to drop their trousers"},"276":{"dur":3,"text":"and get a friend who had equally\nas little oxygen in his blood"},"279":{"dur":2,"text":"to get a big needle and\nput it in his groin."},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"Rather him than me,\nbut they did do it,"},"285":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's where he\ngot the numbers from."},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"So why on Earth or\nwhat persuaded someone"},"289":{"dur":2,"text":"to drop their trousers on\nthe summit of Mount Everest"},"292":{"dur":0,"text":"to be stabbed with a needle?"},"293":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, I have to go back\nto the very beginning"},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"to explain why they\nwanted to do that,"},"297":{"dur":1,"text":"what they found,\nand what is useful."},"299":{"dur":2,"text":"Of note also in this\nslide is there's a chap"},"302":{"dur":4,"text":"in a yellow jacket, and he's\nthe Sherpa that led them"},"306":{"dur":1,"text":"up the top of the summit."},"308":{"dur":1,"text":"Twenty-four people\nwent up to the summit."},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"This was in the 2000\nexpedition, and they were led"},"312":{"dur":1,"text":"by this Sherpa, who looks\nlike he's doing a runner,"},"315":{"dur":1,"text":"and he was actually\ndoing a runner"},"316":{"dur":3,"text":"because in his thermos flask is\nnot a good bit of British tea,"},"319":{"dur":3,"text":"but it's some blood samples,\nand he's about to run"},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"down the mountain to\nanalyze those samples."},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"And to give you an\nidea, the team."},"327":{"dur":3,"text":"So Dan, who had his blood taken,\nthey descended from the summit"},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"to base camp in about\n48, 49 hours."},"333":{"dur":4,"text":"This Sherpa ran down the\nmountain in an hour and a half."},"337":{"dur":1,"text":"So they're pretty remarkable\npeople, and we'll come back"},"339":{"dur":2,"text":"to them shortly, but yes."},"342":{"dur":1,"text":"If you ever do it,\nwalk down, don't run."},"343":{"dur":6,"text":"So, as I said, I have to explain\nwhat they were doing there,"},"349":{"dur":0,"text":"why they were doing it."},"350":{"dur":2,"text":"So it goes back to\ncase medicine."},"353":{"dur":3,"text":"Now case medicine is, belongs\nto UCL, and it's the center"},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"of altitude, space, and\nextreme environment medicine,"},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"and it was set up in\nabout the year 2000"},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"by two doctors who\nwork here now."},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"A chap who's now a professor at\nDown South called Mike Grocott"},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"and a doctor called Kevin\nFarm, who's always on TV."},"370":{"dur":3,"text":"Now these doctors are intensive\ncare doctors, and they,"},"374":{"dur":1,"text":"as they strolled\naround their wards,"},"376":{"dur":1,"text":"found that about 90\npercent of patients"},"378":{"dur":3,"text":"in intensive care suffer from\nproblems with oxygenation"},"381":{"dur":4,"text":"and low levels of oxygen, and\nthey use a word called hypoxia"},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"or hypoxic, which means\nis if someone is hypoxic,"},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"it means they have suffering\nfrom low levels of oxygen."},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll try and not use that\nword, but if I do say it,"},"394":{"dur":0,"text":"it gives you an idea why."},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"So these doctors thought, well,"},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"90 percent of our patients\nare suffering from low levels"},"401":{"dur":1,"text":"of oxygen, be it, because\nthey've got problems"},"402":{"dur":1,"text":"with breathing, because of\nproblems with their heart."},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"They've just had an operation."},"406":{"dur":1,"text":"They're suffering\nsevere infection,"},"407":{"dur":1,"text":"but they had problems\nwith oxygenation."},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"They also know that in\nmedicine, to progress treatment"},"413":{"dur":0,"text":"and to change treatment,"},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"it's all really evidence-based\ndriven."},"416":{"dur":1,"text":"So evidence-based medicine."},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"So to bring out a new\ntreatment, you have to go"},"420":{"dur":1,"text":"through clinical trials,\nshow that it's better"},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"than what's standing,\nand so forth."},"425":{"dur":1,"text":"But the problem in intensive\ncare is these patients are"},"427":{"dur":3,"text":"so unwell, they're often\nin these induced comas."},"430":{"dur":4,"text":"So, a., they can't consent; b.,\nfamilies are very unwilling,"},"434":{"dur":4,"text":"quite rightly, to consent their\nrelatives, their loved ones"},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"into these studies;"},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"and [inaudible] can\nbe troublesome to get."},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"So they came up with\nthis paradigm, really,"},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"and they thought that\nperhaps the physiological"},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"and pathophysiological responses"},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"to an extreme environmental\nchallenge, such as going"},"454":{"dur":3,"text":"to high altitude, may be\nsimilar to those responses"},"457":{"dur":3,"text":"or those responses we\nsee in critical illness."},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"So if we talk about the\nlow levels of oxygen,"},"463":{"dur":1,"text":"90 percent of patients\nhave low levels"},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"of oxygen in intensive care."},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"Upper high mountain where\nthe pressure's much lower,"},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"everyone up there suffers\nfrom low levels of oxygen."},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"So they thought going very\nhigh would mirror being"},"474":{"dur":1,"text":"in intensive care."},"475":{"dur":1,"text":"The low oxygen up\nthere would be similar"},"477":{"dur":1,"text":"to the low oxygen down there."},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"And they thought, to [inaudible]"},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"that if they entered\nthese healthy people,"},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"so people like you and I sat\naround today and took them"},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"to high altitude, they\ncould look at who did well"},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"and who did badly at high\naltitude, look at them"},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"from the outside, but also look"},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"at all their physiological\nparameters and measure lots"},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"of things going on in\ntheir blood and body,"},"501":{"dur":1,"text":"and they could see who did well"},"502":{"dur":1,"text":"and who did badly\nin front of us."},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"They could then look at\nthe people who did well"},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"when they walked up a high\nmountain and see, well,"},"509":{"dur":1,"text":"what were they doing\nor what were they doing"},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"that was different to those\nthat were doing very badly."},"514":{"dur":1,"text":"What was it that was\nallowing them to cope well"},"516":{"dur":3,"text":"and functionally be lucid, such\nas down on the top of Everest?"},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"What was it that was allowing\nhim to do so well at the top"},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"of Everest whereas\nif I tried strolling"},"524":{"dur":1,"text":"up there I would\ncertainly do very badly?"},"525":{"dur":3,"text":"And so they could then find what\nallows some people to do well"},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"in those low levels of oxygen."},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"They could translate that back\ninto the intensive care unit,"},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"and perhaps allow people\nin the intensive care unit"},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"to cope better with\nlow levels of oxygen."},"538":{"dur":3,"text":"For example, if they found\nthere was a certain molecule"},"541":{"dur":1,"text":"in the blood of the,\nin the, you know,"},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"high levels of a certain\nmolecule in the blood of people"},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"who coped very bad, very\nwell at high altitude,"},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"they could perhaps\nsynthesize that molecule,"},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"give it to the unwell patients\nin intensive care units,"},"552":{"dur":3,"text":"and allow them to perhaps\ncope better with the hypoxic"},"556":{"dur":1,"text":"or the low oxygen insult"},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"that people obviously\nencounter in intensive care."},"561":{"dur":4,"text":"So that's really why we\ndid the expedition in 2007."},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"Why we're going to\ngo back again."},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"So really this translational\napproach"},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"from a high-altitude environment\nthat mirrors the intensive care"},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"or the hospital setting."},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"It is, indeed, an\nunorthodox approach."},"578":{"dur":3,"text":"People are now really accepting\nit, but in 2007, when they went"},"582":{"dur":1,"text":"for the first time, certainly,"},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"there were a lot of\nskeptics among us."},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"And Sir Edmund Hillary,\nthe legend that he is,"},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"certainly didn't help\nour cause when he wrote"},"590":{"dur":4,"text":"that nobody climbs mountains\nfor scientific reasons."},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"Science is used to raise\nmoney for the expedition,"},"597":{"dur":1,"text":"but you can really climb\nfor the hell of it."},"600":{"dur":1,"text":"So as much as I respect him,"},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"he certainly didn't make\nthings very easy for us."},"605":{"dur":1,"text":"When we, in 2007, we did summit."},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"We're not summiting this\nso we can, you know,"},"609":{"dur":1,"text":"argue against him there."},"611":{"dur":3,"text":"And people do argue\nthat, you know,"},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"this is just a boys club\nclimbing up mountains."},"617":{"dur":3,"text":"Certainly it didn't in 2007, but\nit's become much more understood"},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"and respected now, and,\ncertainly, we've had hundreds"},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"of publications from 2007, and\nit is widely respected now."},"627":{"dur":3,"text":"Some people do ask,\nand very rightly,"},"630":{"dur":1,"text":"why do we not just put\npeople in a chamber."},"632":{"dur":3,"text":"So at altitude, we are\nsuffering from a low oxygen,"},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"which is derived from\nthe low pressure."},"638":{"dur":1,"text":"We could theoretically\ndo this in a chamber,"},"640":{"dur":2,"text":"or one of these chambers,\neither of these chambers."},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"The chamber on the\nleft as you look"},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"at is actually a\nchamber we have at UCL,"},"647":{"dur":1,"text":"which is up [inaudible] archway,"},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"and that is a normal-pressure\nchamber,"},"651":{"dur":1,"text":"and we just turn the\noxygen levels down really."},"653":{"dur":3,"text":"So we can turn the levels\ndown to about 11 percent."},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"Normal oxygen levels here\nare about 21 percent."},"659":{"dur":3,"text":"So the chamber on the right\nis one with our collaborators"},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"at Duke in America, which\nis we alter the pressure,"},"665":{"dur":1,"text":"which drops the oxygen levels."},"667":{"dur":1,"text":"And they certainly\ndo have their place."},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"We can do many more invasive\ntrials and look at people"},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"because they're almost\nin a hospital setting,"},"675":{"dur":1,"text":"but they are very\nexpensive to buy."},"676":{"dur":3,"text":"They're very expensive to run,\nand I can almost guarantee"},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"that if I offered anyone here\nthe chance to [inaudible]"},"682":{"dur":4,"text":"over three weeks or sit into a\ntiny box about the size of this"},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"for three weeks, most\npeople would probably opt"},"688":{"dur":0,"text":"for the Everest."},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe. Maybe not."},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"So a chamber does\nhave its place,"},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"but not on large-scale\nexpeditions such as ones we do."},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"So that is case."},"701":{"dur":3,"text":"That's why we do it, and the\nfirst expedition was called"},"704":{"dur":0,"text":"Extreme Everest."},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"It was named after our major\nsponsor, James [Inaudible]."},"709":{"dur":4,"text":"This expedition ended up\nputting 24 people on the summit"},"714":{"dur":1,"text":"of Everest, and it\nwas led by the chap"},"716":{"dur":1,"text":"in the very center\ncalled Mike Grocott,"},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"and he certainly masterminded,"},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"it's actually credit,\nthanks to him."},"722":{"dur":4,"text":"He's got the UCL flag on the top\nof Everest, proudly bearing it."},"728":{"dur":3,"text":"So when they went\nto Everest in 2007,"},"731":{"dur":1,"text":"bearing in mind what we've\njust talked about briefly,"},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"what were the questions\nthey had in mind?"},"736":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, they wanted to see\nwhat governs performance"},"739":{"dur":3,"text":"or how well one does at altitude\nin that low level oxygen."},"743":{"dur":3,"text":"We are using altitude\nas the case for,"},"747":{"dur":1,"text":"really for the lower\noxygen it provides."},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"So what governs how\nwell one does"},"751":{"dur":1,"text":"in the low levels of oxygen."},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"Is it to do with how much\noxygen they have in their body?"},"756":{"dur":1,"text":"Is it to do with how\nthey deliver that oxygen"},"757":{"dur":1,"text":"around their body,\nor is it to do"},"759":{"dur":1,"text":"with how your body uses oxygen?"},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"Do they become a\nbit more efficient"},"763":{"dur":1,"text":"with using what little\noxygen they have?"},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"Could they manipulate important\nmechanisms to alter outcome?"},"769":{"dur":2,"text":"If it's, you know, if\nit was all down to DNA,"},"771":{"dur":1,"text":"then perhaps we wouldn't\nbe able to bring"},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"that into the hospital\nsetting and alter someone's DNA"},"775":{"dur":1,"text":"because we can't really do that."},"777":{"dur":1,"text":"But were there things that\nwe could theoretically find"},"778":{"dur":2,"text":"that we could translate\nto the hospital setting."},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"And also they did want to look\nat are genetics important."},"784":{"dur":1,"text":"Is it all down to\ngenetics or not?"},"786":{"dur":3,"text":"So they planned the expedition."},"790":{"dur":4,"text":"And the way this expedition\nworks is that they got lots"},"794":{"dur":3,"text":"of healthy volunteers, and\nI should say that everyone"},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"who goes on the expedition has\nan investigator, such as myself,"},"800":{"dur":2,"text":"has to do exactly what their\nvolunteers do plus a lot,"},"803":{"dur":0,"text":"lot more."},"804":{"dur":1,"text":"So I know there's\nsome subjects here"},"805":{"dur":1,"text":"in the audience, and\nI feel your pain."},"808":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'm hobbling because\nI've had a muscle biopsy,"},"809":{"dur":3,"text":"which we haven't\nmade anyone else do."},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"So we get about 200\nhealthy people, like I said,"},"815":{"dur":3,"text":"that's kind of a homogenous\npopulation, and we get them"},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"in groups of 14, and they\ncome to our lab in London,"},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"or when 2007 they\ncame to lab in London."},"823":{"dur":1,"text":"They had some experiments\ndone on themselves,"},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"and we could then see what\nhappened to their body"},"828":{"dur":1,"text":"or what is happening\nin their body"},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"when they are in\n21 percent oxygen."},"832":{"dur":1,"text":"So within normal oxygen levels."},"834":{"dur":3,"text":"We'll then fly them out in\ntheir groups of 14 to Nepal"},"838":{"dur":1,"text":"where they go to Kathmandu."},"840":{"dur":1,"text":"So they've gone from about 75,"},"841":{"dur":1,"text":"100 meters to about\n1,000 meters,"},"843":{"dur":1,"text":"and we repeat all\nthe same experiments."},"845":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we've turned down the\nknob in the hospital setting,"},"847":{"dur":1,"text":"we're turning down\nthe oxygen levels,"},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"and we repeat everything again,\nand we can now say, well,"},"851":{"dur":2,"text":"has anything changed if we\nturn the oxygen levels down."},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"They then stroll up to about\nthree and a half thousand meters"},"856":{"dur":3,"text":"up through the valleys, and we\nrepeat again everything to see,"},"860":{"dur":2,"text":"well, now they've got the third\namount of oxygen that they had"},"862":{"dur":0,"text":"at base, at sea level."},"863":{"dur":0,"text":"Has anything changed?"},"865":{"dur":2,"text":"And then the group of 200, in\ntheir groups of 14 [inaudible]"},"868":{"dur":2,"text":"by four days, strolled up to\nfive and a half thousand meters,"},"871":{"dur":3,"text":"which is Everest base camp, and,\nagain, we did everything again."},"874":{"dur":2,"text":"So we could see progressively\nas we were
