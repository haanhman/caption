got those\nbuilding blocks in place,"},"2600":{"dur":1,"text":"we're more likely\nto remember it."},"2602":{"dur":3,"text":"And I did go into a\ncompany somewhere,"},"2606":{"dur":1,"text":"and I made that recommendation."},"2607":{"dur":4,"text":"And I looked up, and there\nwas panic on everyone's faces."},"2611":{"dur":1,"text":"So I said, how about twice?"},"2613":{"dur":4,"text":"Just let the

talk\na bit about that."},"2661":{"dur":2,"text":"Because in my mind, they\nseem a little orthogonal,"},"2663":{"dur":3,"text":"the leadership quotient and\nthe compassion quotient."},"2667":{"dur":4,"text":"And the second question is, we\njust did an annual performance"},"2671":{"dur":2,"text":"review that we all\nhave to fill out--"},"2673":{"dur":2,"text":"different

me do some lovingkindness."},"3047":{"dur":2,"text":"Then I'd do some lovingkindness\nfor two and a half seconds,"},"3049":{"dur":1,"text":"and then I'd think,\nwow, that's

five minutes,"},"3124":{"dur":1,"text":"and you sit for\nonly five minutes."},"3125":{"dur":3,"text":"That's good, because that's\nlike a discharge of tension"},"3128":{"dur":1,"text":"and stress."},"3130":{"dur":2,"text":"But you don't have a\nchance to go deeper."},"3132":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you've only\ngot five minutes,"},"3135":{"dur":1,"text":"I say, yes, do five minutes."},"3136":{"dur":4,"text":"If you can do 10 or 15 or\n20, it's that much better."},"3141":{"dur":1,"text":"But it's the every\nday-ness of it"},"3142":{"dur":3,"text":"that is the
