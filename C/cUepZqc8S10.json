the\nJustice Department was able to"},"341":{"dur":3,"text":"successfully conclude a\nfraud case against a major"},"344":{"dur":3,"text":"pharmaceutical company and\ncollected $2.3 billion for the"},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"Government for the taxpayers\nbecause they had been over"},"351":{"dur":1,"text":"charging Medicare."},"352":{"dur":1,"text":"So they were able to\nget that money

savings"},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"that we need to help\nfund this new program."},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"So about half the savings that\nwe need to fund the new program"},"396":{"dur":3,"text":"and

down."},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"For example, I used the example\na few minutes ago about the"},"460":{"dur":3,"text":"Medicare advantage payments to\nprivate insurance

every year come up to"},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"that -- hit that donut hole."},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"And when they are in that\ncoverage gap in the drug"},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"benefit, they have to pay\nfor their drugs themselves."},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"And for a lot of seniors\nthat's a real hardship."},"504":{"dur":4,"text":"So starting next summer we are\ngoing to reduce that donut hole by half."},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"And then over the next ten\nyears we are going to totally"},"511":{"dur":0,"text":"eliminate it."},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"That will be something\nthat will benefit Mary,"},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"you and other seniors."},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"Ms. Cannistra:\nApril has a question\nabout abortion,"},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"and she wants to know, \"To what\nextent

thinks he wants to make\nsure that people who have been"},"551":{"dur":3,"text":"injured or have been, you know,\nthe victim of a medical error"},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"are properly

demonstrations"},"600":{"dur":1,"text":"that will help us to\nknow what really works."},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, we are going to move\nforward with that right away."},"605":{"dur":3,"text":"We have a question from Kathleen\nfrom Albuquerque, New Mexico."},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"She was recently laid off\nafter working 20 years for the"},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"software

them maintain"},"649":{"dur":0,"text":"their coverage."},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"So I hope, Kathleen, you were\nable to take advantage of that."},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"But one of the things that will\nbe terrific about the new system"},"656":{"dur":4,"text":"is that right now as Kathleen's\ncase so well illustrates,"},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"if you lose your job and you had\na health insurance through your"},"662":{"dur":1,"text":"job, you're really out of luck."},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"It's very difficult to go out\nand purchase insurance in the"},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"individual

more competition."},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"We think this exchange had\nhelped foster competition among"},"746":{"dur":4,"text":"plans, that will be\noffering benefit packages."},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"But we also think that there's a\nplace for a government sponsored"},"754":{"dur":3,"text":"option that would compete\nwith using the same rules,"},"757":{"dur":3,"text":"and it would have to have\ncapital that it raises through"},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"its premiums."},"762":{"dur":4,"text":"And it would compete with\nprivate plans to provide a good benefit."},"767":{"dur":3,"text":"He thinks it would be useful to\nhave that as an alternative out"},"770":{"dur":3,"text":"there for people who might\nchoose it as a benchmark to look"},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"at whether they are getting good\nvalue for their money with the"},"775":{"dur":1,"text":"private plan."},"776":{"dur":4,"text":"As he said, our estimates based\non what
