Switzerland as a very\nnon-reflected, lazy troublemaker."},"151":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"153":{"dur":4,"text":"You know, the kind of kids\nteachers never wanted to deal

was also the reason"},"180":{"dur":4,"text":"why I lost my first apprenticeship\nat an insurance company"},"185":{"dur":2,"text":"after only eight months."},"189":{"dur":3,"text":"And the funny but also sad fact about it:"},"193":{"dur":3,"text":"I didn't even recognize it\nas my own mistake."},"197":{"dur":4,"text":"So a few months later, I got diagnosed -"},"202":{"dur":5,"text":"my back

story:"},"226":{"dur":3,"text":"at the screening for the Swiss Army"},"229":{"dur":3,"text":"the cardiologist couldn't even\ntake a proper X-ray of my heart,"},"233":{"dur":5,"text":"because my spine was twisted so bad\nthat it got covered almost completely."},"239":{"dur":4,"text":"And this started to worry me\nabout my future,"},"243":{"dur":2,"text":"especially my health."},"246":{"dur":2,"text":"Time went by,"},"248":{"dur":3,"text":"the doctors were adamant\nthat I had to take on physiotherapy"},"252":{"dur":3,"text":"but after a few weeks\nI gave up on that again."},"256":{"dur":4,"text":"Time went by,\nand my back issues got worse."},"261":{"dur":2,"text":"I was secretly hoping"},"263":{"dur":4,"text":"that there is a magic pill\nwhich could solve my

solution"},"277":{"dur":3,"text":"which turned out\nto be the key to my success."},"280":{"dur":4,"text":"He proposed going to the gym\nonly twice a week"},"284":{"dur":5,"text":"to build up my overall muscularity,\nand help my condition."},"289":{"dur":2,"text":"Now that didn't sound\nlike a bad idea, you know."},"292":{"dur":4,"text":"I instantly saw chances\nof approaching women,"},"296":{"dur":3,"text":"walking on the beach\nwith a nice six-pack and muscular arms,"},"300":{"dur":3,"text":"and of course,\nall the girls staring at me."},"303":{"dur":2,"text":"And that was actually\nhow it began my journey"},"306":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"307":{"dur":3,"text":"to become the best version of myself."},"311":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah, now a few of you will ask,"},"313":{"dur":2,"text":"like: how can swinging\nsome dumbbells in the gym"},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"change your life so drastically?"},"321":{"dur":5,"text":"I strongly believe\nthat your physical fitness"},"326":{"dur":4,"text":"has a great influence\non your mental health,"},"332":{"dur":4,"text":"and you can't enhance one\nwithout the other to a certain extent."},"336":{"dur":3,"text":"Therefore, you need to build\nup your physical strength"},"339":{"dur":3,"text":"to reach your full potential."},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"Let me give you a few examples here."},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"As soon as you start to work out,"},"348":{"dur":4,"text":"you start to sweat,\nyou start to breathe deeply,"},"353":{"dur":4,"text":"and after you finished\nyou just feel absolutely amazing"},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"to not say [unlimited]."},"361":{"dur":4,"text":"And the reason for this is endorphins:"},"366":{"dur":4,"text":"a hormone your body releases\nafter you get physically active."},"371":{"dur":3,"text":"It's comparable to the high runners get"},"375":{"dur":3,"text":"after they surpass the first heavy miles."},"379":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's also the reason\nwhy so many people nowadays"},"382":{"dur":4,"text":"choose the gym or a run\nas a part of their morning routine,"},"387":{"dur":3,"text":"you know, to get a head start\nabove everyone else."},"391":{"dur":6,"text":"Another even more important reason\nis your body posture."},"397":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not only proven"},"399":{"dur":6,"text":"that a bad body posture\ncauses people to appear insecure and sad,"},"406":{"dur":3,"text":"but also to change\ntheir whole mental state."},"409":{"dur":1,"text":"And it goes in both directions:"},"411":{"dur":4,"text":"that means, as soon as you start\nto work on your physical appearance,"},"416":{"dur":1,"text":"you're not only going to look happier,"},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"you can become happier, more secure."},"423":{"dur":4,"text":"Amy Cuddy held a very\ninteresting TED talk about this topic,"},"428":{"dur":4,"text":"like body language shapes who you are,\nbe sure to check that out."},"434":{"dur":1,"text":"And, I mean for a lot of you guys,"},"435":{"dur":3,"text":"I see so many young,\nambitious students here,"},"439":{"dur":4,"text":"that you guys, you've already worked hard,\nyou know, like you have dreams."},"443":{"dur":4,"text":"You study for weeks, months,\nyears, even for decades"},"447":{"dur":5,"text":"with the goal to change\nthe world someday, right?"},"452":{"dur":4,"text":"But what if you can't make it\nout of bed anymore,"},"457":{"dur":3,"text":"because you're going to suffer\nfrom chronic back pain."},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"That's actually the case\nfor a lot of young people nowadays -"},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"working in offices,\nand studying in schools."},"467":{"dur":1,"text":"This should give you a first impression"},"469":{"dur":6,"text":"of how your physical fitness\naffects your mentality as well."},"475":{"dur":1,"text":"But there is more."},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"Natural bodybuilding"},"480":{"dur":5,"text":"also, helps people\nto become self-confident."},"485":{"dur":5,"text":"And, people wrongly assume\nthat the muscle itself"},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"are the reason\nfor this change in attitude."},"493":{"dur":4,"text":"But, I want you to explain\nwhy there is a way more relevant factor"},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"when it comes to this change."},"500":{"dur":1,"text":"You know,"},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"as soon as you start to work out,"},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"you're going to realize that the mirror"},"506":{"dur":5,"text":"is both your best friend\nand your worst enemy."},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"Looking in it will always"},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"reveal something new\nyou want to work on,"},"518":{"dur":3,"text":"and this kind of\nself-criticism is necessary,"},"521":{"dur":4,"text":"if you really want to improve,\nnot just in terms of bodybuilding."},"526":{"dur":4,"text":"The reflection in the mirror\ncreates the ability"},"531":{"dur":5,"text":"to reflect on oneself\non a much deeper level,"},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"and it gave me courage"},"538":{"dur":4,"text":"to become my own biggest critic\nin everything I do."},"544":{"dur":2,"text":"And, it can help you as well."},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"Self-reflection is a process;"},"550":{"dur":4,"text":"it builds up slowly but constantly."},"555":{"dur":3,"text":"You learn to accept yourself"},"558":{"dur":4,"text":"because knowing about\nyour weaknesses is not enough,"},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"if you're not willing to work on yourself."},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"People still struggle\nto overcome their doubts,"},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"and to take action in order to get better."},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"Something deep inside them\nwon't let them believe"},"578":{"dur":4,"text":"that they need to invest in themselves\nif they want to succeed in life."},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"And, I get it, you know,"},"586":{"dur":5,"text":"because taking action\nrequires courage, right?"},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"But why is that?"},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"Because you could fail."},"600":{"dur":3,"text":"I always hear failing is something bad,\nyou should avoid failing,"},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"like society tells us failing is negative."},"608":{"dur":4,"text":"But I want you to understand\nwhy failing is actually important"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"if you really want to get better."},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's take it even a step further here."},"618":{"dur":5,"text":"You need failure in order to grow"},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"but how can I be so sure about that,"},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"because failing every day"},"632":{"dur":4,"text":"made me one of the best\nnatural bodybuilders in the world."},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"Yes, you heard it right, people."},"639":{"dur":4,"text":"I fail almost every\nsingle day, and I love it."},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"Every time I step into the gym,"},"647":{"dur":3,"text":"my goal is to push myself\npast my limits."},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"I know that reaching failure"},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"will only make me stronger\nin the long run."},"658":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, some of you heard\nabout supercompensation,"},"663":{"dur":1,"text":"there would be a slide right now here,"},"665":{"dur":1,"text":"but there is not."},"666":{"dur":4,"text":"So supercompensation\nis a scientific term which explains"},"670":{"dur":5,"text":"that as soon as you overreach\na certain capacity your body has,"},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"you get stronger than before."},"681":{"dur":3,"text":"So that means you have to overreach\nand overreach and overreach,"},"684":{"dur":4,"text":"and with this, you get stronger\nand stronger and stronger every time."},"689":{"dur":3,"text":"So failing for a bodybuilder\nis nothing new."},"693":{"dur":5,"text":"What most people don't get:\nit works the same in your everyday life."},"699":{"dur":4,"text":"So why do people\napply this logic in the gym"},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"but not in everything else they do,"},"705":{"dur":5,"text":"because the road to success\nis never straight."},"711":{"dur":1,"text":"You know this cooperation like that,"},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"that's what you hear\nlike the road to success"},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"how people think it is,\nand actually how it is,"},"717":{"dur":1,"text":"it's the same like supercompensation,"},"719":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's up and down."},"722":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's the reason\nwhy so many young people nowadays"},"726":{"dur":6,"text":"choose natural bodybuilding\nas a key tool to personal growth."},"734":{"dur":4,"text":"So, should everybody in this room now\nbecome a natural bodybuilder or what?"},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"740":{"dur":3,"text":"Of course, come on."},"743":{"dur":1,"text":"No, of course not."},"745":{"dur":4,"text":"But everybody in this room"},"750":{"dur":4,"text":"should strive to become\nthe best version of themselves."},"754":{"dur":4,"text":"And natural bodybuilding\nis a major stepping stone to get there."},"759":{"dur":5,"text":"Look at the bigger picture,\nand forget the negative prejudice;"},"764":{"dur":4,"text":"it's more than just a sport,\nit's a lifestyle."},"770":{"dur":3,"text":"Why don't you start today -\ninvest in yourself,"},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"go beyond in the gym,"},"778":{"dur":5,"text":"and I promise you, you will go beyond\nin every other aspect of life as well."},"784":{"dur":1,"text":"It's your decision."},"786":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you."},"787":{"dur":3,"text":"(Applause)"}}
