discuss kind of these issues"},"33":{"dur":4,"text":"about data in general, and have a good discussion\nand see where it takes us."},"38":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: Excellent."},"39":{"dur":5,"text":"Michael: So, the first question, people don't\nrealize this, I think, but the idea of the"},"44":{"dur":5,"text":"federal government collecting statistics about\nthe U.S. population has a very old pedigree"},"50":{"dur":1,"text":"in the United States."},"51":{"dur":1,"text":"Would you like to say a few words about that?"},"53":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: Absolutely."},"54":{"dur":1,"text":"So, this goes all the way back to our founding\nfathers."},"55":{"dur":6,"text":"So, James Madison observed sort of at the\ndawn of our countries' existence that data"},"61":{"dur":4,"text":"on agriculture, on commercial and manufacturing\ninterests would be particularly useful to"},"66":{"dur":3,"text":"the legislature as they try to accurately\nrepresent people."},"70":{"dur":6,"text":"And so, we've actually named this document\nafter his quote on this where he says, \"You"},"77":{"dur":4,"text":"want to collect the data in order that they\nmight rest

assertions?"},"87":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: That's right."},"88":{"dur":5,"text":"And he recognized at that point that this\nwould enable not only government to work more"},"93":{"dur":2,"text":"efficiently, but also it would enable the\neconomy to grow."},"96":{"dur":1,"text":"Michael: And it's in the Constitution."},"97":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: Indeed."},"98":{"dur":2,"text":"Michael: The Constitution itself mandates\nthe Census."},"101":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: I know we both love the Constitution."},"102":{"dur":1,"text":"Michael: We do."},"103":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: Yes."},"104":{"dur":1,"text":"Michael: And again, who doesn't?"},"106":{"dur":1,"text":"So, this is a very old pedigree."},"108":{"dur":5,"text":"The mandate for the government to collect\nstatistics about the population is actually"},"113":{"dur":1,"text":"in the constitution."},"114":{"dur":3,"text":"The government does a lot of things, not all\nof them are directly in the Constitution."},"118":{"dur":1,"text":"You can go right there and read it."},"119":{"dur":3,"text":"So, this is obviously something the founding\nfathers thought was important, obviously something"},"123":{"dur":2,"text":"that we continue to think is important."},"125":{"dur":1,"text":"People..."},"126":{"dur":3,"text":"Diane: I could add that the historians tell\nus that it was a uniquely American idea, to"},"130":{"dur":2,"text":"have the government so involved in this."},"133":{"dur":3,"text":"And again, that it really helped us with comparative\nadvantage."},"136":{"dur":2,"text":"Michael: For decades and decades, the United\nStates was really the leader."},"139":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: ...the leader."},"140":{"dur":1,"text":"Exactly."},"141":{"dur":2,"text":"Michael: And we've kind of slipped a little\nbit, which is sad."},"143":{"dur":1,"text":"But maybe we can..."},"144":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: We'll make statistics great again."},"146":{"dur":1,"text":"Michael: Exactly."},"147":{"dur":3,"text":"So, people know that statistics are out there."},"151":{"dur":2,"text":"They know that the government produces statistics."},"153":{"dur":7,"text":"But my sense is that there is some...there's\nnot enough recognition about the many ways"},"160":{"dur":4,"text":"in which statistics are used, particularly\nby businesses."},"164":{"dur":4,"text":"The fact that businesses rely on official\nstatistics is something that I don't think"},"169":{"dur":3,"text":"gets enough recognition by the general public."},"172":{"dur":2,"text":"Can you tell us a little about how businesses\nuse these data?"},"175":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: I agree, absolutely."},"176":{"dur":2,"text":"So, the modern economy is very reliant on\ndata."},"179":{"dur":6,"text":"You hear people talk about big data all the\ntime and just accurate, timely data is necessary"},"185":{"dur":5,"text":"for businesses to make decisions about where\nto locate their stores, where to put their"},"191":{"dur":4,"text":"warehouses, all sorts of things about stocking\nshelves, and so on."},"196":{"dur":5,"text":"So, a lot of data businesses collect on their\nown, so from their own cash register receipts,"},"201":{"dur":1,"text":"or whatever."},"202":{"dur":6,"text":"And they are able now with computers to analyze\nvast quantities of this data to forecast staffing"},"209":{"dur":3,"text":"needs, and again, shelf-stocking requirements\nand so on."},"212":{"dur":5,"text":"But alongside of this is this really complementary\nrole that federal government data provides."},"218":{"dur":3,"text":"So, this spans a range of things."},"221":{"dur":5,"text":"So, of course, all of us, all of the nerds\nare glued to our seats the first Friday of"},"227":{"dur":5,"text":"the month when the employment numbers are\nreleased, and markets move in response to"},"233":{"dur":1,"text":"that."},"234":{"dur":3,"text":"That gives us sort of an early signal of the\nhealth of the economy, and I think businesses"},"237":{"dur":2,"text":"pay close attention to that."},"240":{"dur":3,"text":"In addition, something that not a lot of people\nknow a ton about is the American Community"},"244":{"dur":3,"text":"Survey, which is a very large data set collected\nby the Census Bureau."},"248":{"dur":1,"text":"It's got about 2 million observations."},"249":{"dur":7,"text":"And so what that allows us to do is drill\ndown into local areas and understand much"},"257":{"dur":4,"text":"about sort of local area employment situation,\ndemographics and so on."},"262":{"dur":5,"text":"And all of that is very useful to businesses,\nagain, as they think about how to target their"},"267":{"dur":5,"text":"goods, where to locate, where they'll find\nthe labor with the skills that they need,"},"272":{"dur":1,"text":"and so on."},"273":{"dur":4,"text":"Michael: So, we have some great charts and\ngraphs and pictures in the report, and one"},"278":{"dur":5,"text":"of them shows the distribution of population\nage over the country, where there are elderly"},"284":{"dur":1,"text":"people."},"285":{"dur":7,"text":"And as a concrete example, a business wants\nto know what to try and sell in Florida."},"292":{"dur":4,"text":"And they look and they see these counties\nin Florida, the elderly population is actually"},"296":{"dur":5,"text":"increasing, so we're going to put more goods\nthere that kind of target the over-65 crowd."},"302":{"dur":5,"text":"That's an example of a business decision that\nhappens every day that couldn't be possible"},"308":{"dur":4,"text":"without official data that the business knows\nit can rely on."},"312":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: And it goes even further than that,\nright?"},"314":{"dur":5,"text":"So, we can not only look to see where are\nthe elderly, but what's their income level,"},"319":{"dur":4,"text":"are they married, how old are they in terms\nof elderly, and so on."},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"So, it's very rich data that's really useful."},"326":{"dur":2,"text":"Michael: It is."},"329":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's free."},"330":{"dur":1,"text":"They just log on."},"331":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: And it's free."},"332":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, free to the user."},"333":{"dur":1,"text":"No such thing as free anything."},"334":{"dur":7,"text":"Michael: So, you mentioned some of the non-government\nsourced data, the big data, cash register"},"341":{"dur":1,"text":"data, those sorts of things."},"343":{"dur":6,"text":"This is a revolution, I think, in information."},"350":{"dur":3,"text":"And there's an argument out there which is\nthat, okay, well, when James Madison wrote"},"354":{"dur":4,"text":"the Constitution, it was not possible for\na non-government entity to collect these sorts"},"358":{"dur":1,"text":"of statistics."},"360":{"dur":5,"text":"But here we are in the year 2017, and technology\nhas evolved, and if businesses are able to"},"366":{"dur":4,"text":"do all of this themselves, why do we need\nthe government to do it anymore?"},"370":{"dur":5,"text":"And I wonder if you could discuss the report's\nview of the relationship between public data"},"376":{"dur":1,"text":"and private data."},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"Diane: So, we certainly think of these as\ncomplementary."},"380":{"dur":4,"text":"And we think that government-collected data\ncould do a few things that the private sector"},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"won't do on its own."},"385":{"dur":5,"text":"In particular, I think of that as that government\ndata is comprehensive, and that is that, of"},"391":{"dur":5,"text":"course, businesses can only collect information\non their own business, whereas government"},"396":{"dur":4,"text":"statistics will collect over a much wider\nswath of people, so it's comprehensive."},"400":{"dur":1,"text":"It's also consistent."},"402":{"dur":4,"text":"So, in addition to being able to measure data\nquickly, also because we've been doing it"},"406":{"dur":7,"text":"over such a long time period, we're able to\ndo things like compare things that have been"},"413":{"dur":3,"text":"consistently measured over time, whether that's\nthe unemployment rate, or that's employment"},"417":{"dur":2,"text":"to population ratio, or GDP."},"419":{"dur":5,"text":"Certainly, we're always trying to make those\nmeasurements better, but having this consistent,"},"424":{"dur":4,"text":"comprehensive data set over time is also very\nuseful."},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"And then third, it's very credible."},"431":{"dur":7,"text":"There are strong requirements around transparency\nthat's imposed both by Congress and statistical"},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"agencies have really embraced."},"441":{"dur":4,"text":"These data are scrutinized both by markets\nand by researchers."},"446":{"dur":3,"text":"When there are mistakes, and of course there\nare always mistakes in anything that we humans"},"449":{"dur":4,"text":"do, they're corrected in a transparent and\ntimely manner."},"454":{"dur":4,"text":"So, the federal statistical agencies have\nthis refined set of practices that ensure"},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"quality and impartiality."},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"Michael: And the objective is different, right?"},"462":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: Absolutely."},"463":{"dur":7,"text":"Michael: When a business is collecting data\nfor themselves, they're interested in what"},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"they're interested in."},"471":{"dur":3,"text":"They're interested in how their business is\ndoing, how it's interacting with their customers,"},"475":{"dur":3,"text":"how they can kind of chart their growth and\nreceipts over a certain period of time, or"},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"whatever specifically they're interested in."},"480":{"dur":5,"text":"The official statistics are designed to be\nnationally representative, so you can take"},"486":{"dur":3,"text":"this sample and really learn things about\nthe population as a whole."},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"So, they're both very nice complements to\neach other."},"492":{"dur":7,"text":"And I think the argument that sometimes is\nhad that one is better than the other, or"},"500":{"dur":3,"text":"we don't need one and we do need the other,\nI think that sometimes misses the point."},"504":{"dur":5,"text":"I think the point is that they really work\nwell together, and they should be paired together"},"509":{"dur":1,"text":"and used together more often."},"511":{"dur":3,"text":"But you can't really have one without the\nother."},"514":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: Exactly."},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"And there's a real public good aspect to this,\nthat the government is stepping in and collecting"},"519":{"dur":4,"text":"data, making it available for free to potential\nusers."},"523":{"dur":1,"text":"Michael: What is a public good?"},"525":{"dur":4,"text":"Diane: Ah, well, a public good...thanks for\nasking that."},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"It's one of my favorite concepts in my economics\ncourses."},"534":{"dur":10,"text":"And that is something that has use more than\njust to the individual who is collecting the"},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"data."},"546":{"dur":5,"text":"So, if I were a large corporation, I would\nbe very interested in collecting demographic"},"551":{"dur":5,"text":"data on the neighborhoods where I have located\nmy stores."},"557":{"dur":5,"text":"But I would under-invest in doing that because\nyou would get a lot of use out of that, too."},"562":{"dur":4,"text":"So, either I could do that in proprietary\nmanner, or you and I could decide to work"},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"together to join forces in this."},"570":{"dur":1,"text":"There are good reasons."},"571":{"dur":5,"text":"The Econ 101 reason is you would try to undercut\nme and provide a little bit less money for"},"576":{"dur":3,"text":"this, and I would try to undercut you, and\nthen we would sort of have this race to the"},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"bottom."},"580":{"dur":4,"text":"It's a perfect area where government can come\nin and say, \"Look, we do need some sort of"},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"optimal level of information on this."},"587":{"dur":4,"text":"We can make some smart public investments\nhere,\" and then provide the information to"},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"both the two of us and to everyone else who\nneeds this."},"595":{"dur":5,"text":"Michael: It's the kind of thing that if a\ncollective action were taken, there would"},"600":{"dur":1,"text":"not be enough of this..."},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: That's exactly right."},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"Michael: ...because one person is not going\nto front-load all the costs."},"605":{"dur":4,"text":"And when people start to work together, then\nnobody has the incentive to provide enough"},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"resources."},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: That's exactly right."},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"Michael: So, there are things like this."},"613":{"dur":6,"text":"It belongs in a category with national defense,\nwith other sorts of big things that the government"},"619":{"dur":5,"text":"provides because you can't rely on private\nactors to adequately fund it, which may be"},"625":{"dur":1,"text":"part of why it's in the constitution."},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: Indeed."},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"Michael: Along with the military."},"630":{"dur":3,"text":"So, we've talked about business uses."},"633":{"dur":5,"text":"We've talked about how the publicly provided\ndata are complementary with private sector"},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"data."},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"You are the director of the Hamilton Project."},"642":{"dur":3,"text":"I am the Director of Economic Policy Studies\nat AEI."},"646":{"dur":4,"text":"Obviously, we do public policy for a living."},"651":{"dur":7,"text":"These data are absolutely necessary to understand\npublic policy, to understand how policy interacts"},"658":{"dur":5,"text":"with the economy, to understand how policy\ninteracts with individual people and individual"},"663":{"dur":1,"text":"families."},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"I wonder if you could say a few words about\nhow the data are used in policy."},"668":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: Right."},"669":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I agree, this is our bread and butter\nas policy analysts, so we have to use these"},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"data to try to understand the world around\nus."},"676":{"dur":5,"text":"So, we did a whole chapter on this and we\nhad to really keep it tight to cut down that"},"681":{"dur":4,"text":"chapter because we had just example after\nexample after example of really important"},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"work done."},"686":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll talk about a few of my favorites."},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"So, one is that...you may recall."},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"I think you were still in junior high when\nPresident Clinton signed the Welfare Reform"},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"Bill."},"696":{"dur":7,"text":"But we switched his very pro-work policies,\nbig EITC expansion and welfare reform."},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"One of the graphs that we include in this\ndocument looks at what happened in the short"},"707":{"dur":5,"text":"run in terms of did women go to work after\nthe introduction of these pro-work policies,"},"712":{"dur":1,"text":"and you absolutely see that."},"713":{"dur":1,"text":"There's a large spike in that."},"715":{"dur":3,"text":"But then, a concern that we have now, and\nI think that our colleague Nick Eberstadt"},"719":{"dur":4,"text":"has been particularly on the forefront of\nthis, is we're seeing labor force participation"},"723":{"dur":4,"text":"rates come back down both among men and among\nwomen."},"728":{"dur":5,"text":"So, being able to track those things over\ntime, we could use clever research techniques"},"733":{"dur":1,"text":"to tease out cause and effect."},"735":{"dur":5,"text":"But overall, we're able to look at this and\nunderstand this important part of the economy."},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"Michael: Absolutely."},"743":{"dur":5,"text":"Other big things too that people talk about,\npeople are considered about family breakdown."},"748":{"dur":5,"text":"People are concerned about what happened to\nunemployed workers during the Great Recession."},"753":{"dur":4,"text":"People are concerned about the rise of Food\nStamp rolls."},"758":{"dur":3,"text":"People are concerned about so many things\nit would be impossible to be concerned about"},"762":{"dur":5,"text":"these things if the government wasn't keeping\ntrack of beneficiary roles, if the government"},"767":{"dur":3,"text":"wasn't keeping track of statistics about the\nlabor market, if the government wasn't keeping"},"771":{"dur":7,"text":"track about the basic ways that these policies\ninteract with people in the economy, with"},"778":{"dur":1,"text":"the economy at large."},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"We just wouldn't know anything."},"783":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: That's right."},"784":{"dur":4,"text":"Then we would be forced to, just like James\nMadison warned us, we would have to debate"},"789":{"dur":3,"text":"based on assertions and conjectures instead\nof facts."},"792":{"dur":4,"text":"We always like to quote Daniel Patrick Moynihan\nwho liked to say, \"Everyone is entitled to"},"797":{"dur":1,"text":"his own opinion, but not to his own facts.\""},"799":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think these government statistics really\nhelp us have some common language."},"803":{"dur":4,"text":"You and I can debate all day about what the\nfacts mean or what the causes are of the facts"},"808":{"dur":1,"text":"and I enjoy doing that."},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"Nonetheless, we can both agree that these\nare facts."},"811":{"dur":3,"text":"Michael: When we started working on this,\nI didn't expect James Madison would play such"},"814":{"dur":4,"text":"a large role in this, but there he is."},"819":{"dur":4,"text":"Diane: Yeah, I always prefer Hamilton myself,\nbut yes."},"823":{"dur":7,"text":"Michael: So, one of the biggest users of government\ndata, or at least one of the most important"},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"users, is the Fed."},"831":{"dur":3,"text":"Diane: Do you want to explain a little bit\nabout how the Federal Reserve uses these data?"},"834":{"dur":1,"text":"Michael: Well, sure."},"835":{"dur":3,"text":"The Fed has to decide where to set interest\nrates."},"839":{"dur":2,"text":"This is an extremely important decision."},"841":{"dur":3,"text":"There's a reason why it gets so much media\nattention and press coverage."},"845":{"dur":3,"text":"The decision of the Fed to move the interest\nrate up a little bit or move the short-term"},"849":{"dur":3,"text":"interest rate down a little bit ripples throughout\nthe economy."},"852":{"dur":3,"text":"It affects the mortgage you pay when you buy\na house."},"856":{"dur":4,"text":"It affects the amount of interest you owe\non a car when you go and buy a car."},"860":{"dur":3,"text":"It affects business decisions."},"863":{"dur":5,"text":"Most economists believe that by changing the\npolicy rate, the short-term interest rate,"},"869":{"dur":5,"text":"the Fed can either heat up the economy or\ncool down the economy."},"874":{"dur":5,"text":"The Fed needs good information in order to\nmake that critically important decision."},"880":{"dur":2,"text":"Primarily, the Fed looks at two things."},"882":{"dur":4,"text":"The Fed looks at the health of labor markets,\nand the Fed looks at the behavior of prices."},"887":{"dur":6,"text":"So, if you see the rate of price inflation\nincrease too fast, the Fed is concerned that"},"893":{"dur":3,"text":"inflation is going to take off and that it\nwill harm the economy."},"896":{"dur":1,"text":"They try and pump the breaks."},"898":{"dur":4,"text":"If, on the other hand, the Fed sees that there's\na lot of slack in the labor market, unemployment"},"902":{"dur":5,"text":"is high, participation is cyclically low,\nthen the Fed will try to leave interest rates"},"907":{"dur":6,"text":"low in order to speed up the economy and pull\nthose workers back into the workforce."},"914":{"dur":6,"text":"This requires extremely accurate information\nabout the health of labor market and extremely"},"920":{"dur":5,"text":"accurate information about prices, both of\nwhich the government collects."},"925":{"dur":6,"text":"If the information were even a little bit\nless accurate and the Fed were to make a mistake"},"931":{"dur":7,"text":"as a consequence of poor data, or lower quality\ndata, then that would cost real money."},"939":{"dur":6,"text":"So, there's an aspect of government data that\nreally is investment."},"945":{"dur":5,"text":"This isn't just writing checks to produce\ndata, and if you were to cut the funding for"},"950":{"dur":4,"text":"statistical agencies, you get a little less\ndata, but you'd be spending less money."},"955":{"dur":5,"text":"The decisions that are made based on data\nhave enormous economic consequences."},"961":{"dur":4,"text":"The Fed is a great example, but there are\nother examples as well, I think."},"965":{"dur":4,"text":"The Social Security Administration, for example,\nwhen calculating social security benefits,"},"970":{"dur":1,"text":"uses the consumer price index."},"972":{"dur":4,"text":"If the consumer price index is mismeasured\na little bit, that can result in billions"},"976":{"dur":4,"text":"and billions of dollars of misallocated payments."},"981":{"dur":5,"text":"So, there's a sense in which tax payer dollars\nare buying data and that's kind of a scalable"},"987":{"dur":6,"text":"thing, but the consequences of lower quality\ndata have enormous economic impacts."},"994":{"dur":5,"text":"Michael: So, the data are obviously important,\nand we've talked about how this is actually"},"999":{"dur":4,"text":"a constitutionally mandated function of government,\nto gather these data."},"1004":{"dur":3,"text":"But of course, the world was different in\nthe 18th century when the Constitution was"},"1007":{"dur":1,"text":"written."},"1008":{"dur":4,"text":"Today somebody might ask, \"Well, we have all\nthis technology, we have big data, companies"},"1013":{"dur":3,"text":"are collecting data, we have electronic records\nand all sorts of stuff."},"1016":{"dur":3,"text":"Does the government still need to be involved\nin this?"},"1019":{"dur":3,"text":"Why can't we just rely on the data that private\nbusinesses collect?"},"1023":{"dur":4,"text":"Why can't we have a Kickstarter campaign,\nwhere everybody chips in five bucks and all"},"1027":{"dur":3,"text":"of the sudden, we have all the data that we\nwould ever want?\""},"1030":{"dur":3,"text":"Economists have a good answer to this and\nI think the answer is right, and I wonder"},"1034":{"dur":2,"text":"if you would like to discuss that."},"1036":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: Sure, there are a couple of answers\nto that."},"1038":{"dur":9,"text":"The first is we know that whenever people\nget together and try to find a way to sort"},"1048":{"dur":5,"text":"of build something for the common good, there's\nincentives for some people to shirk."},"1053":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, we can say, \"There's a Kickstarter\ncampaign, and we're each going to throw in"},"1057":{"dur":2,"text":"$5 to collect these data.\""},"1060":{"dur":6,"text":"But maybe I would prefer to take my money\nand go buy a really nice latte, and so then"},"1066":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not going to send it."},"1067":{"dur":2,"text":"Or maybe I'll just going to send a dollar\nor two."},"1070":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, every individual has the incentive\nto do that."},"1074":{"dur":6,"text":"And so in economics, we've got a strong prediction\nthat then we just won't be able to collect"},"1080":{"dur":3,"text":"enough money to do this optimally, so we'll\nunder-provide that."},"1084":{"dur":1,"text":"Michael: It's a feature of the good, right?"},"1086":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: Exactly."},"1087":{"dur":3,"text":"Michael: So, if this good exists, then I can\nuse it."},"1090":{"dur":5,"text":"There's no way to stop me from benefiting\nfrom economic statistics."},"1095":{"dur":3,"text":"The Fed is going to make decisions based on\nhigh-quality economic statistics."},"1099":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm going to benefit from those good decisions."},"1102":{"dur":3,"text":"Businesses are going to make decisions about\nwhere to locate

Northern Virginia."},"1122":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: Exactly."},"1123":{"dur":3,"text":"And the important piece is that you and I\nare going to benefit from that whether or"},"1126":{"dur":1,"text":"not I kick in my $5."},"1128":{"dur":1,"text":"Michael: Exactly."},"1129":{"dur":1,"text":"Exactly."},"1130":{"dur":4,"text":"Because I know I'm going to benefit from those\nthings, I have a strong incentive not to chip"},"1134":{"dur":2,"text":"in because I'm going to get it anyway."},"1136":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: And then you can keep your $5."},"1137":{"dur":2,"text":"Michael: Then I can keep my $5 while still\nenjoying it."},"1140":{"dur":2,"text":"The problem is that that makes rational sense\nfor me."},"1142":{"dur":1,"text":"That makes rational sense for you."},"1144":{"dur":1,"text":"If makes rational sense for everybody..."},"1146":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: Individually, that's right."},"1147":{"dur":4,"text":"Michael: ...then you end up with the idea\nthat the Kickstarter campaign would work,"},"1152":{"dur":4,"text":"the idea that we could rely on private businesses\nto do this on their own suddenly starts to"},"1156":{"dur":4,"text":"fall apart because nobody has an incentive\nindividually to actually chip in."},"1161":{"dur":2,"text":"Another example of this is national defense."},"1163":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: That's right."},"1164":{"dur":4,"text":"Michael: Everybody wants a military that can\nprotect the country."},"1168":{"dur":4,"text":"Everyone wants a police forces that can protect\nour neighborhoods."},"1173":{"dur":6,"text":"It's impossible to stop me from benefitting\nfrom a good police force in my local city,"},"1179":{"dur":6,"text":"it's impossible for me not to benefit from\na really well-funded and well-trained military."},"1186":{"dur":5,"text":"That takes away the incentive for me to chip\nin voluntarily, which is why we think of national"},"1191":{"dur":6,"text":"defense, and why we think of police forces\nas goods that need to be provided by government,"},"1198":{"dur":2,"text":"where government has to catalyze that collective\naction."},"1200":{"dur":4,"text":"Diane: Exactly, because we all share the benefits,\nthen we all have to share the costs and that's"},"1205":{"dur":3,"text":"a very difficult, probably impossible to do\nwith just voluntary donations."},"1208":{"dur":2,"text":"Michael: There are other reasons as well,\nI think."},"1211":{"dur":6,"text":"So, it's true that a big retail store has\nthis strong incentive to produce good statistics"},"1218":{"dur":6,"text":"about that retail store, about its customers,\nabout its products, about trends in a local"},"1224":{"dur":3,"text":"economy or whatever that affect the business."},"1227":{"dur":5,"text":"But that retail store does not have an incentive\nto provide nationally representative data,"},"1233":{"dur":3,"text":"data that are true about the population as\na whole regardless of whether members of that"},"1237":{"dur":5,"text":"population shop at the store, regardless of\nwhether members of that population are affecting"},"1243":{"dur":3,"text":"the trends that affect the particular business,\ntoo."},"1246":{"dur":5,"text":"So, somebody has to be keeping an eye on what\nis true and accurate for the economy as a"},"1251":{"dur":6,"text":"whole and for society as a whole, and businesses\njust don't have an incentive to do that."},"1257":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, the incentives that businesses do have\nto collect data about their own activities"},"1263":{"dur":5,"text":"provide a wealth of really useful information\nthat can complement official statistics and"},"1269":{"dur":1,"text":"vice versa."},"1270":{"dur":3,"text":"So, the official statistics are better because\nof what private businesses are doing, and"},"1274":{"dur":4,"text":"private businesses are able to better gather\ndata for themselves because of what the official"},"1278":{"dur":1,"text":"statistics are doing."},"1279":{"dur":3,"text":"So, we should think of these as complementary\nand not as one or the other."},"1282":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: I agree wholeheartedly."},"1284":{"dur":5,"text":"Michael: Tell me kind of a quirky anecdote\nabout data that we've learned from research"},"1289":{"dur":3,"text":"that you think is interesting, that kind of\nillustrates the unexpected benefit."},"1293":{"dur":4,"text":"Diane: There are so many things that researchers\nhave been able to tease out from this government"},"1298":{"dur":1,"text":"data."},"1299":{"dur":2,"text":"So, one of my favorite recent papers looked\nat the following event."},"1302":{"dur":4,"text":"So, if you remember in the old days, if you\nwere driving down the New Jersey Turnpike,"},"1306":{"dur":4,"text":"every couple of miles, you had to stop and\nthrow in your 35 cents to get through the"},"1311":{"dur":1,"text":"toll."},"1312":{"dur":3,"text":"There would be these longs lines, and you\nhad to make sure that you had change, and"},"1316":{"dur":2,"text":"you'd be sitting there idling for quite some\ntime before you got to throw in your change"},"1319":{"dur":1,"text":"and then speed off to the next one."},"1321":{"dur":1,"text":"So, they replaced that with E-ZPass."},"1322":{"dur":7,"text":"So, no longer do you have to have your 35\ncents, but also you're able to speed through"},"1329":{"dur":3,"text":"without having these big traffic backups."},"1333":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, of course that led to there being less\nvehicle emissions in the air."},"1339":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, what these researchers were able to\ndo was see, well, how did the introduction"},"1342":{"dur":4,"text":"of E-ZPass impact infant health in the area?"},"1346":{"dur":2,"text":"What they found was infants are born healthier."},"1349":{"dur":5,"text":"They're healthier as a result of not breathing\nin all of this smog."},"1354":{"dur":5,"text":"So, consumers were better off because they\ndidn't have to wait and find their 35 cents,"},"1359":{"dur":1,"text":"but they were able to use this."},"1361":{"dur":4,"text":"So, they're getting to their destinations\nfaster, but then the public health is also"},"1365":{"dur":1,"text":"better."},"1366":{"dur":2,"text":"So, that's something we would not have known\nif it weren't for this."},"1368":{"dur":2,"text":"Michael: Technology marches forward."},"1371":{"dur":2,"text":"Data is collected and we can find unexpected\nbenefits."},"1373":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: Exactly."},"1374":{"dur":4,"text":"Michael: So, we've been talking a lot about\nhow important official statistics are, how"},"1379":{"dur":4,"text":"important the statistical agencies are, how\nimportant they are to businesses, how important"},"1384":{"dur":4,"text":"they are to the policy making process, how\nimportant they are to the research community"},"1388":{"dur":4,"text":"in understanding the effects of public policy,\nand that's all true."},"1393":{"dur":7,"text":"But there are reasons to be concerned about\nthe government collecting all this information,"},"1401":{"dur":5,"text":"and I think the most important reason to be\nconcerned about that is concerns about privacy."},"1406":{"dur":6,"text":"All this data comes from businesses and households\nfilling out forms and putting personal information"},"1413":{"dur":1,"text":"on there."},"1414":{"dur":2,"text":"And some of that information is extremely\npersonal: how much money you earn, what your"},"1417":{"dur":6,"text":"marital status is, other aspects of your family\nlife."},"1423":{"dur":5,"text":"The statistical agencies take this extremely\nseriously and go to great lengths to protect"},"1429":{"dur":4,"text":"the privacy of respondents and I wondered\nif you could talk a little bit about that."},"1433":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: That's exactly right."},"1434":{"dur":4,"text":"The statistical agencies are very mindful\nthat they have to keep the public trust to"},"1438":{"dur":1,"text":"continue to do their jobs."},"1440":{"dur":5,"text":"And so, they have very strict rules and laws\naround confidentiality."},"1445":{"dur":4,"text":"And in fact, the misuse of data is very closely\nmonitored, and there's fines and prison terms"},"1450":{"dur":3,"text":"for those who break any of those rules."},"1453":{"dur":4,"text":"In fact, when I have used these data as a\nresearcher...you know, they put you through"},"1458":{"dur":5,"text":"extensive training, and they warn you repeatedly\nthat this is a misuse of data and, by the"},"1464":{"dur":3,"text":"way, then you will go to jail, which is a\nlittle bit daunting."},"1467":{"dur":2,"text":"Think about it, \"I'm just trying to run some\nregressions here.\""},"1470":{"dur":4,"text":"But nonetheless, it underscores how seriously\nthey take this."},"1475":{"dur":5,"text":"Some other things to add here is this sort\nof information is protected."},"1480":{"dur":6,"text":"For example, it cannot be used against a respondent\nin the case of a criminal investigation."},"1487":{"dur":7,"text":"And furthermore, it's important to note that\nalmost everyone in these bureaucracies are"},"1494":{"dur":1,"text":"career civil servants."},"1495":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, at the Bureau of Labor Statistics\nwhich collects information on unemployment"},"1499":{"dur":5,"text":"and so on, only one political appointee works\nthere."},"1504":{"dur":3,"text":"Everyone else is a dedicated career civil\nservant, and they take their jobs very, very"},"1508":{"dur":1,"text":"seriously."},"1509":{"dur":4,"text":"Michael: And by the time the data gets down\nto the user level, it's been anonymized and"},"1514":{"dur":1,"text":"scrubbed of identifying information."},"1516":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: It would be impossible."},"1517":{"dur":4,"text":"It certainly would be impossible to me to\nmisuse it."},"1522":{"dur":6,"text":"But nonetheless, they take this so seriously\nthat they make every researcher go through"},"1528":{"dur":5,"text":"training around this, and you really emphasize\nthe grave consequences of any misuse."},"1534":{"dur":4,"text":"Michael: So, I think it's more than fair to\nsay that the statistical agencies take this"},"1539":{"dur":4,"text":"extremely seriously and that the current safeguards\nare working."},"1543":{"dur":4,"text":"And in addition, they're always looking to\nimprove the safeguards."},"1547":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: Yes."},"1549":{"dur":5,"text":"When we started this project, I spoke to a\nlot of people who either currently or in the"},"1554":{"dur":4,"text":"past work for these agencies and they all\npointed me to various handbooks, very, very"},"1559":{"dur":4,"text":"dense, thick handbooks that govern how the\ndata are used."},"1563":{"dur":3,"text":"And I would not recommend to you to read those,\nbut I have now done so."},"1567":{"dur":5,"text":"And what I can attest to you is that they\ntake this very seriously."},"1573":{"dur":4,"text":"Confidentiality and impartiality are really\nguarded by these agencies because they know"},"1578":{"dur":2,"text":"that's critical to public trust."},"1580":{"dur":2,"text":"Michael: You were talking about the unemployment\nrate."},"1582":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: Oh, yeah."},"1583":{"dur":1,"text":"A little bit, if we can."},"1585":{"dur":4,"text":"So, one example of a government statistic\nthat has gotten a lot of attention recently"},"1590":{"dur":1,"text":"is the unemployment rate."},"1592":{"dur":7,"text":"So, some people seem to think that it's inaccurate,\nmisleading, a hoax sometimes it's been called."},"1600":{"dur":4,"text":"I think what's important to think about here\nis the unemployment rate, or understanding"},"1604":{"dur":3,"text":"the labor market, is sort of like that old\nparable about the blind men and the elephant,"},"1608":{"dur":1,"text":"right?"},"1609":{"dur":3,"text":"If you remember it, the one comes over and\nthinks that an elephant is like a tree because"},"1613":{"dur":3,"text":"it measures its legs, and the other things\nit's like a rope because he's holding his"},"1617":{"dur":2,"text":"tail, and I forget what the ear guy thinks."},"1619":{"dur":4,"text":"But there's just lots of different parts that\nmake up an elephant, and indeed there's lots"},"1624":{"dur":4,"text":"of different pieces that make up what the\nlabor market looks like."},"1628":{"dur":2,"text":"So, for example we've got the payroll jobs\ncount."},"1630":{"dur":2,"text":"That's the thing that comes out the first\nFriday of the month."},"1632":{"dur":3,"text":"Also, the employment rate and the labor force\nparticipation rate."},"1636":{"dur":4,"text":"So, those two things are distinct, but they're\nboth very important in their own way."},"1640":{"dur":4,"text":"So, currently, the unemployment rate has come\nback down from its spike during the Great"},"1644":{"dur":1,"text":"Recession."},"1645":{"dur":1,"text":"It's down to 4.9%."},"1647":{"dur":6,"text":"But importantly, that's only people who say\nthat they're actively looking for work, that"},"1653":{"dur":1,"text":"they're part of the labor force."},"1655":{"dur":8,"text":"A very concerning development in the economy\ntoday is that labor force participation rates"},"1663":{"dur":3,"text":"have been coming down."},"1666":{"dur":2,"text":"In some corners of the market, coming down\nquite dramatically."},"1669":{"dur":6,"text":"So, for example, prime-age men...so these\nare men who we usually think of as they're"},"1676":{"dur":7,"text":"working...the share of them that are not in\nthe labor force rose from 9% in 2007 to 11%"},"1683":{"dur":1,"text":"this year in 2017."},"1685":{"dur":3,"text":"At the same time, we're seeing more and more\nwomen dropping out of the labor force."},"1688":{"dur":5,"text":"So, that's just a different piece to understanding\nthe whole that is the labor market."},"1694":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I think what's important is there's not\none piece that will tell the whole labor market"},"1698":{"dur":4,"text":"story, but the BLS when they collect these\ndata, are working very hard at collecting"},"1703":{"dur":6,"text":"multiple pieces so that then someone can then\nstep back and say, \"Okay, this is what the"},"1709":{"dur":3,"text":"market as a whole looks like, the sum of all\nthese different parts.\""},"1713":{"dur":1,"text":"Michael: There are a lot of things you want\nto know."},"1715":{"dur":6,"text":"So, you want to know of the adult population,\nhow many of them are trying to find a job"},"1722":{"dur":1,"text":"or are working."},"1723":{"dur":2,"text":"How many of them are actively participating\nin the workforce?"},"1725":{"dur":2,"text":"And when we have a statistic for that."},"1727":{"dur":6,"text":"Then you'd want to know of the population\nwho are trying to find a job or actively working,"},"1734":{"dur":2,"text":"how many of them are not succeeding."},"1737":{"dur":1,"text":"All these people want to be working."},"1738":{"dur":4,"text":"We know that because they either are working\nor because they're trying to work."},"1742":{"dur":2,"text":"How any of them are in the \"trying to work\"\ncategory?"},"1745":{"dur":2,"text":"And we have a statistic for that, which is\nthe unemployment rate."},"1748":{"dur":3,"text":"You might also want to know of the people\nwho are working, how many of them are working"},"1751":{"dur":2,"text":"as many hours as they would like to."},"1754":{"dur":3,"text":"How many of them are working part time for\neconomic reasons when they would really want"},"1757":{"dur":1,"text":"to work a full-time job?"},"1759":{"dur":1,"text":"We have a statistic for that."},"1760":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: It's the U6, that's right."},"1762":{"dur":5,"text":"Michael: There are all sorts of labor market\nindicators that are produced."},"1767":{"dur":5,"text":"And as you say, the right way to assess the\nhealth of the labor market is to kind of take"},"1773":{"dur":2,"text":"a step back and look at all of these."},"1776":{"dur":3,"text":"The Fed chair, Janet Yellen, has referred\nto this as a dashboard approach."},"1779":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: Exactly."},"1780":{"dur":6,"text":"Michael: And I think that helps to get a holistic\npicture certainly."},"1786":{"dur":6,"text":"It also helps to put some context around some\nof the criticisms of individual statistics."},"1792":{"dur":7,"text":"So, there is an element of...it's not unreasonable\nto look at the unemployment rate and say,"},"1799":{"dur":6,"text":"\"That is not an accurate indicator for the\noverall health of the labor market.\""},"1806":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe you think it is, maybe you think it's\nnot."},"1807":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not an unreasonable view."},"1809":{"dur":6,"text":"It is unreasonable and wrong to say that it\nis a hoax or to say that it is a fiction or"},"1815":{"dur":1,"text":"something like that."},"1817":{"dur":6,"text":"I think the reasonable side of the coin is\nto say, \"Well, sure, that's accurately measured,"},"1824":{"dur":4,"text":"but that doesn't represent what's happening\nthroughout the labor market as a whole and"},"1828":{"dur":1,"text":"we need some other indicators.\""},"1830":{"dur":2,"text":"And fortunately, the other indicators are\nthere."},"1832":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: Exactly."},"1833":{"dur":3,"text":"And we do think that potentially the unemployment\nrate is getting to be a worse indicator over"},"1837":{"dur":4,"text":"time, and that means it's all the more important\nto gather all the pieces together."},"1841":{"dur":3,"text":"Michael: So, let's talk about moving forward."},"1845":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: Yes."},"1847":{"dur":5,"text":"Michael: So, the economy is changing, society\nis changing."},"1852":{"dur":5,"text":"How should the Federal Statistical System,\nhow should official statistics keep up with"},"1858":{"dur":1,"text":"that?"},"1859":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: Oh, sure."},"1860":{"dur":2,"text":"There are many challenges that we need to\nface."},"1862":{"dur":2,"text":"I think of them in a couple of different buckets."},"1865":{"dur":4,"text":"The first is we really need to address some\nlimitations in the data as they currently"},"1869":{"dur":1,"text":"stand."},"1870":{"dur":6,"text":"So, for example, even though many people have\ngone to prison, you know, we see a spike in"},"1876":{"dur":5,"text":"arrest rates and prison rates, we don't actually\nhave comprehensive data on who has a criminal"},"1882":{"dur":1,"text":"record."},"1883":{"dur":4,"text":"So, there are a lot of questions that we just\ncan't ask or answer appropriately because"},"1888":{"dur":5,"text":"we don't know what share of individual people\nhave a criminal record."},"1893":{"dur":2,"text":"Another example is..."},"1896":{"dur":2,"text":"And I took Uber this morning."},"1898":{"dur":1,"text":"Right?"},"1899":{"dur":6,"text":"This has been a major change in how we interact\nwith the economy, is the gig economy."},"1905":{"dur":4,"text":"I think there's some good evidence that the\ndata that we collect right now is just not"},"1909":{"dur":5,"text":"keeping up with these rapid changes in the\nlabor market, and we need it to."},"1915":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I think we need to make some investments\nin there."},"1918":{"dur":1,"text":"Do you have any favorites that you want to\nadd?"},"1919":{"dur":1,"text":"Michael: I like those too."},"1921":{"dur":5,"text":"We have a changing society, and one of the\nfeatures of society is that we have a lot"},"1926":{"dur":4,"text":"of people who are out there in the world who\nserved some time in jail."},"1931":{"dur":4,"text":"And we think that there might be some economic\nconsequences to having been incarcerated."},"1935":{"dur":2,"text":"We think there might be social consequences\nto having been incarcerated."},"1938":{"dur":5,"text":"The data just aren't up to the job of allowing\nus to study that."},"1943":{"dur":3,"text":"The nature of work is changing."},"1947":{"dur":1,"text":"You mentioned Uber."},"1948":{"dur":3,"text":"There are a dozen other examples."},"1951":{"dur":6,"text":"Even among people who have what we would think\nof as old-fashioned jobs, telework is becoming"},"1957":{"dur":7,"text":"much more common, working from home, working\nodd hours, doing all those kinds of things."},"1965":{"dur":1,"text":"How do we measure that?"},"1966":{"dur":3,"text":"How do we understand what's happening?"},"1970":{"dur":4,"text":"How do we understand how policy is interacting\nwith those changes?"},"1974":{"dur":7,"text":"I think at the agency level, there are other\nimportant ways to improve the data as well."},"1981":{"dur":7,"text":"It would be good if different agencies could\ncombine and share data more readily."},"1989":{"dur":2,"text":"Of course, privacy is extremely important."},"1991":{"dur":3,"text":"You want to keep privacy safeguards in place,\nand you want to keep the statutory [SP] intent"},"1994":{"dur":2,"text":"of these surveys from taking place."},"1997":{"dur":4,"text":"But within that, there is scope for the agencies\nto learn from each other."},"2002":{"dur":6,"text":"There's scope to make all the data better\nand more accurate through some pretty simple"},"2008":{"dur":1,"text":"sharing exercises."},"2009":{"dur":5,"text":"Diane: I would add to that, the potential\nto link survey data that the government collects"},"2015":{"dur":5,"text":"along with administrative data is a very important\nsort of step forward."},"2021":{"dur":3,"text":"So, the reason that this has become such a\nbig deal is that over time, people are less"},"2024":{"dur":5,"text":"likely to respond to government survey requests,\nand they're also more likely to refuse to"},"2030":{"dur":3,"text":"answer certain questions."},"2034":{"dur":6,"text":"And then third, they're more likely to misreport\nthings like, they'll misreport whether they're"},"2040":{"dur":2,"text":"on, let's say, the Food Stamp Program."},"2042":{"dur":5,"text":"So, we can very clearly document that just\nthe data has gotten less good over time."},"2048":{"dur":5,"text":"So, there's, I think, important work being\ndone trying to link the survey data to administrative"},"2053":{"dur":3,"text":"benchmarks, so that will improve the accuracy\nof the data."},"2057":{"dur":4,"text":"It also actually could potentially drive down\nthe costs of some of this because it's very"},"2062":{"dur":5,"text":"expensive to continue to pursue people who\nwant to refuse to answer questions."},"2067":{"dur":1,"text":"Michael: Yeah."},"2069":{"dur":1,"text":"No, absolutely."},"2070":{"dur":3,"text":"And you have the budget numbers."},"2074":{"dur":1,"text":"How much are we spending on data now?"},"2075":{"dur":7,"text":"Diane: So, it's less than 1\/5 of 1% goes to\nthe statistical agencies."},"2083":{"dur":7,"text":"Michael: So, an important policy question,\nI think, is whether that is adequate given"},"2091":{"dur":7,"text":"the changing needs that are facing these agencies."},"2098":{"dur":6,"text":"To be very simple about it, we need more questions\non some existing surveys."},"2104":{"dur":3,"text":"We need more information about alternative\nwork arrangements."},"2108":{"dur":5,"text":"We need more information about more people\nin the population with a criminal background."},"2113":{"dur":2,"text":"We need more information about a number of\nother things."},"2115":{"dur":1,"text":"Adding questions costs money."},"2117":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: That's right."},"2118":{"dur":3,"text":"Michael: We need better data sharing."},"2121":{"dur":4,"text":"We need the ability to link administrative\nrecords with survey data."},"2126":{"dur":2,"text":"That also requires resources."},"2128":{"dur":6,"text":"If you look over the last 10 years, I believe,\nat least, the share of the federal budget"},"2135":{"dur":5,"text":"that goes to these statistical programs has\nbeen pretty flat, which of course is not true"},"2140":{"dur":2,"text":"for every government program."},"2143":{"dur":4,"text":"It seems to me that there's a legitimate need\nfor at least some increase in funding."},"2147":{"dur":5,"text":"Certainly, we wouldn't want to cut any funding,\nand that's something that I hope that this"},"2153":{"dur":2,"text":"Congress and the administration can focus\non."},"2155":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: I agree with you."},"2157":{"dur":2,"text":"The stakes are only getting higher."},"2159":{"dur":5,"text":"I think the economy is getting more complicated,\nand investing a little bit more in making"},"2165":{"dur":4,"text":"sure that we continue to have the ability\nto measure these things well will really help."},"2170":{"dur":7,"text":"Michael: Another important thing that may\nor may not require extra funding, the data"},"2177":{"dur":1,"text":"aren't perfect."},"2178":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: No."},"2180":{"dur":7,"text":"Michael: And in the enthusiasm about the data,\nit's important, I think, to recognize that."},"2187":{"dur":4,"text":"Maybe you have a few examples of some of the...we've\nalready touched on several."},"2192":{"dur":4,"text":"The data are kind of lagging behind societal\nchanges, the data are lagging behind economic"},"2196":{"dur":1,"text":"changes."},"2197":{"dur":3,"text":"Do you have any other examples of how the\ndata really need to be improved?"},"2201":{"dur":1,"text":"Diane: Oh sure."},"2202":{"dur":4,"text":"So, a source of a lot of debate among academic\neconomists, and these are fun debates to be"},"2207":{"dur":9,"text":"part of, is how much we're understating growth\nand output that is due to sort of computers,"},"2217":{"dur":1,"text":"breakthroughs in computers."},"2218":{"dur":6,"text":"So, people have really done serious work to\ntry to understand how much mismeasurement"},"2224":{"dur":2,"text":"is there going on."},"2226":{"dur":2,"text":"I think some people are convinced that it's\nrelatively small."},"2229":{"dur":1,"text":"Some people think
