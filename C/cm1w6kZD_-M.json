remembered"},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"in the way that articulated."},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"But I had a really\ngood visual memory."},"465":{"dur":4,"text":"And I thought, you know, if\nthere's such an

don't mind it myself."},"536":{"dur":5,"text":"But yeah, it pretty\nmuch happened like that."},"542":{"dur":5,"text":"But I listened to myself,\nmy dreams, my gut

It's\nsuch an amazing story."},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"Even your compressed\nversion like this"},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"is just so inspirational."},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"The movie has been a\nhuge

of the\nthings, but people just"},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"see it in different ways,\nfrom hope and determination."},"619":{"dur":9,"text":"And I guess that's mainly the\nthings that I get talked

survive, you've got to\nfight, day by day, to live."},"697":{"dur":4,"text":"And it shocks people when they\nsee a scene like, I guess."},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's, we live in\nsuch a lucky

[INAUDIBLE]."},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"740":{"dur":3,"text":"So one part of the film in\nparticular I wanted to dig into"},"743":{"dur":3,"text":"was the search, so\nfrom when you started"},"746":{"dur":3,"text":"thinking that you really\nwanted to find your hometown"},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"and using technology to do so."},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"I'd love to know more\nabout your process."},"754":{"dur":1,"text":"We saw some of this in the film."},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"And I don't know how accurately\nthat's representing it."},"758":{"dur":3,"text":"We had maps and these\nsearch radii and so forth."},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"Can you tell us what was\nyour mindset going in?"},"764":{"dur":1,"text":"And then what did you do?"},"766":{"dur":3,"text":"How did that

to going\nto the library."},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you wanted\nto play the guitar,"},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"why pay a tuition when\nyou can go onto YouTube"},"785":{"dur":1,"text":"and learn yourself?"},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"And so it started from there."},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"And I thought, you know,\nthe internet has got so much"},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"information-- and one\nof it's Google Earth--"},"794":{"dur":6,"text":"that I could use this\napplication, as opposed"},"800":{"dur":2,"text":"to going to India\nand paying thousands"},"803":{"dur":5,"text":"and thousands of dollars and\nmaybe getting nowhere, ever."},"808":{"dur":4,"text":"And so when Google Earth\ncame about, I thought--"},"813":{"dur":3,"text":"not knowing what I'm really\ngetting into, because once I"},"816":{"dur":5,"text":"started using it, I became\nquite obsessed and regimented--"},"822":{"dur":3,"text":"finishing work,\ncoming home at 5:30,"},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"putting the laptop, which\nmy girlfriend at the time"},"827":{"dur":3,"text":"called it a fat top,\nbecause I sat on the couch"},"831":{"dur":2,"text":"and there it was."},"834":{"dur":1,"text":"Dinner wasn't cooked."},"835":{"dur":0,"text":"Nothing."},"836":{"dur":4,"text":"So until midnight and\nearly hours of the mornings"},"840":{"dur":4,"text":"as well till 5 o'clock,\n6 o'clock in the

5\no'clock was finishing time."},"855":{"dur":5,"text":"And so you became\nquite obsessed and not"},"860":{"dur":4,"text":"realizing that you're\nshutting the world away"},"864":{"dur":3,"text":"and concentrating in trying to\nfind something that you've been"},"868":{"dur":1,"text":"longing for such a long time."},"870":{"dur":5,"text":"And so from being haphazardly\nlooking to becoming methodical,"},"876":{"dur":3,"text":"it's like well, you've got to\ntake things a step at a time."},"879":{"dur":3,"text":"You've got to use what you know,\nand not what you don't know."},"882":{"dur":5,"text":"And so I knew that the\ntrains went at around 70,"},"888":{"dur":3,"text":"60 kilometers an hour, roughly."},"891":{"dur":3,"text":"And then I had a\nrough guesstimate"},"894":{"dur":3,"text":"that I was on the train for\nabout 12 hours, but knowing now"},"897":{"dur":1,"text":"it was 32 hours."},"899":{"dur":3,"text":"So I didn't really\nhave a lot to go on."},"902":{"dur":2,"text":"But at least I had\nsomething to start,"},"905":{"dur":1,"text":"which is better than nothing."},"907":{"dur":5,"text":"And so that's the way the\nradius line sort of came about."},"912":{"dur":3,"text":"It's like you know point B,\nbut you don't know point A."},"916":{"dur":3,"text":"And I ended up in\nKolkata, as we all know."},"920":{"dur":1,"text":"And so perhaps this\nradius line can"},"922":{"dur":3,"text":"help in creating a\nsearch conference."},"925":{"dur":5,"text":"And so I put a line\nout from Kolkata,"},"930":{"dur":2,"text":"right down from north to south."},"932":{"dur":2,"text":"And that created\nthat hemisphere."},"935":{"dur":3,"text":"And I knew that\nthe hometown's not"},"939":{"dur":2,"text":"going to be straight on\nthe radius line there,"},"941":{"dur":3,"text":"but it's going to be\nin and out, roughly."},"944":{"dur":2,"text":"So that gave a\nbit of a guidance."},"946":{"dur":1,"text":"And so you segregated\nthe north of India,"},"948":{"dur":1,"text":"segregated the south of India."},"952":{"dur":3,"text":"And you were left with\nthis rectangular piece"},"956":{"dur":4,"text":"of after years and years of\nsearching, and pushing things"},"960":{"dur":4,"text":"apart, that this is\nall you're left with."},"964":{"dur":2,"text":"And that radius line\nwas almost telling you"},"967":{"dur":2,"text":"that this is where\nyou should be looking"},"970":{"dur":4,"text":"after segregating those two\npoints, north and south."},"974":{"dur":6,"text":"And calling it providence\nor serendipity, I ended up--"},"980":{"dur":3,"text":"not that I ever conceived that\nI could possibly believe--"},"984":{"dur":4,"text":"you could have ended up from the\nwest side of India to the east."},"989":{"dur":2,"text":"But let's not have\nany stones unturned"},"991":{"dur":4,"text":"and take a shot at looking\nat the west side of India."},"996":{"dur":1,"text":"Hence, I did."},"997":{"dur":3,"text":"And I found that needle in a\nhaystack, which a lot of people"},"1001":{"dur":5,"text":"thought I couldn't, in\n2011, at around 2 o'clock"},"1006":{"dur":2,"text":"in the morning."},"1008":{"dur":4,"text":"So back when I was a\nteenager, I thought to myself,"},"1013":{"dur":4,"text":"in the latter teens, that\natlas is no good for me."},"1017":{"dur":3,"text":"But I hope one day that\nthere would be a program--"},"1021":{"dur":3,"text":"not knowing that it's embryonic\nat that point of time."},"1024":{"dur":5,"text":"And then, in 2005-2006, it\nwas there, the

used it."},"1037":{"dur":4,"text":"And so Google Earth is the\ncatalyst of finding my family."},"1042":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'm sure there are\nother people out there"},"1044":{"dur":3,"text":"in the
