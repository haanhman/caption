{"0":{"dur":5,"text":"Thank you very much for coming along this\nevening. My name is Sarah and I'm here from"},"5":{"dur":6,"text":"a company called Study Options. Study Options\nis essentially like UCAS for any students"},"11":{"dur":5,"text":"who want to apply for Australian and New Zealand\nuniversities. Just before we start can I just check,"},"16":{"dur":4,"text":"does anyone here have Australian or New Zealand\ncitizenship, do you hold passports for either"},"21":{"dur":5,"text":"of the countries? Ok that's good, that makes\nthings nice and straight forward. Ok so what"},"26":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm going to do is I'm just going to go through\na general overview of the education systems"},"30":{"dur":5,"text":"in Australia and New Zealand. So what some\nof the key characteristics of the university"},"36":{"dur":4,"text":"education systems there are, and maybe how they\ncompare to the UK, which obviously you guys"},"41":{"dur":3,"text":"are probably already looking at as options.\nAnd then I'm going to hand over to Will, this"},"44":{"dur":3,"text":"is Will from the University of Otago in New\nZealand, he's come all the way from Dunedin"},"47":{"dur":6,"text":"for the event tonight. So he's going to obviously talk in much more depth about one specific university,"},"54":{"dur":7,"text":"the University of Otago. Ok, so to kick off\nI just want to have a look really at how the"},"61":{"dur":5,"text":"system in Australia and New Zealand compares\nto that that we use in the UK. I think the"},"66":{"dur":5,"text":"first thing to know here is actually even\nthough these universities are so far away-"},"71":{"dur":2,"text":"Will has actually pointed out a couple of\ntimes today that is about as far away from"},"74":{"dur":6,"text":"home that you can possibly, possibly get.\nThe university experience is actually not"},"80":{"dur":5,"text":"as different as you might expect. Both of\nthese countries have UK based education systems."},"86":{"dur":4,"text":"Now what I mean by that is that Australian\nand New Zealand students attend high school,"},"91":{"dur":5,"text":"attend secondary school, for the same number\nof years that we do in the UK. So their school"},"96":{"dur":4,"text":"leaving qualifications are directly equivalent\nto A Levels, International Baccalaureate and"},"100":{"dur":7,"text":"so on and so forth. That means that the systems\nare very easy to move between. So for example"},"107":{"dur":4,"text":"it's very common to have a student do their\nsecondary school education in the UK, then"},"112":{"dur":3,"text":"move to Australia or New Zealand to do their\nbachelors degree, and then potentially come"},"115":{"dur":5,"text":"back to the UK to do a masters or a PhD, and\nso on and so forth, as well as obviously coming"},"121":{"dur":3,"text":"back home to get some work."},"125":{"dur":4,"text":"I think that the straightforwardness of moving\nbetween the systems is obviously a very reassuring"},"130":{"dur":3,"text":"point because there's that instant feeling\nof familiarity really when you're starting"},"133":{"dur":5,"text":"to look at this. But there is also some very\npractical advantages to it as well. It means that"},"139":{"dur":5,"text":"there is very strong recognition of any qualification\nawarded by an Australian or New Zealand university"},"144":{"dur":4,"text":"back here in the UK. From an employers point\nof view, but also by other universities around"},"149":{"dur":4,"text":"the world as well. That also holds true if\nany of you are considering doing professional"},"154":{"dur":5,"text":"qualifications, so for example Engineering,\nMedicine, Dentistry, Nursing, Social Work,"},"159":{"dur":5,"text":"Law, so on and so forth. Those professions\nobviously tend to have very close links, the"},"165":{"dur":4,"text":"regulatory bodies of them sorry I meant. Which\nmeans that for example if you study to become"},"169":{"dur":4,"text":"a vet in Australia or New Zealand you can\ncome straight back to the UK and work without"},"174":{"dur":5,"text":"any need for further tests or any further\nstudy. So there are some very practical advantages"},"180":{"dur":1,"text":"to the similarities."},"181":{"dur":7,"text":"Okay, just in summary, essentially many features\nof university life, and certainly the qualifications"},"189":{"dur":4,"text":"that you come out with, are going to be very\nmuch the same as studying in the UK, and certainly"},"193":{"dur":4,"text":"the degree, the qualification that you emerge\nwith, is going to be the exact equivalent"},"198":{"dur":2,"text":"of a UK awarded degree."},"200":{"dur":5,"text":"Okay I've just got a picture up here of the\nUniversity of Adelaide. So the University"},"205":{"dur":5,"text":"of Adelaide is part of what's called the Group\nof 8. These are the leading Australian institutions"},"210":{"dur":5,"text":"in terms of international rankings, so I'll\ncome onto rankings a little bit more in just"},"216":{"dur":4,"text":"a second, but the Australians do have this\ngroup that they regard as equal to the UK"},"220":{"dur":4,"text":"Russell Group or the US Ivy League for example."},"224":{"dur":5,"text":"Okay, one key difference to be aware of is\nthat the structure of undergraduate degrees"},"230":{"dur":3,"text":"in Australia and New Zealand is much broader\nand much more flexible than you typically"},"234":{"dur":4,"text":"find in the UK. Now by that I mean, I have\na little diagram here just to explain it"},"239":{"dur":4,"text":"a little bit more clearly, when you enroll\non say a Bachelor of Arts, you have to declare"},"243":{"dur":4,"text":"your major subject, so for example I'm going\nto major in History, I'm a Bachelor of Arts"},"248":{"dur":4,"text":"student. The first courses that I have to\nprogram into my timetable every year are core"},"252":{"dur":4,"text":"compulsory courses that every History student\nhas to take. So say for example there are"},"257":{"dur":5,"text":"those two little courses in pale blue, just\nthere on the bottom line of the diagram. Once"},"262":{"dur":4,"text":"I've fulfilled the requirements of my major\nhowever, I'm then free to take courses, to"},"266":{"dur":5,"text":"take papers, from elsewhere within the faculty\nof Arts & Humanities. So for example perhaps"},"272":{"dur":3,"text":"I want to take some International Relations\npapers, I want to take some Politics papers,"},"275":{"dur":7,"text":"maybe a language. I'd be able to slot those\npapers in to the next sections of my timetable."},"283":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, a Bachelor of Arts degree is actually\nthe most flexible degree of any of the undergraduate"},"288":{"dur":5,"text":"degrees, so many of them will actually allow\nyou to take papers from other faculties elsewhere"},"293":{"dur":5,"text":"in the university, not just your own, provided\nyou meet subject prerequisites. This means"},"298":{"dur":3,"text":"that effectively the system allows you to\nbuild a degree that's quite unique to you,"},"302":{"dur":4,"text":"to your interests, to your academic strengths,\nbut also to your career aspirations going"},"306":{"dur":7,"text":"forwards, and it's a very, very flexible system\nas you can see from this. Another advantage,"},"313":{"dur":3,"text":"when you declare your major, say for example\nyou get to the university and you think 'actually"},"317":{"dur":4,"text":"I don't enjoy History as much as I enjoy International\nRelations', it's very straightforward to change"},"322":{"dur":4,"text":"your major during that first year of study.\nSo that's really not a big deal. In the UK"},"326":{"dur":4,"text":"you'd probably have to actually withdraw from\nyour first course and reapply for your second"},"331":{"dur":3,"text":"choice. In Australia and New Zealand you simply\nswitch your major during that first year of"},"334":{"dur":6,"text":"study, and that's a very straight forward\nprocess. The broad ethos I suppose of the"},"341":{"dur":5,"text":"education system is really that they want\nto educate somebody, who is for example a"},"347":{"dur":4,"text":"scientist first and foremost, who happens\nto have a specialisation in physics, or a"},"351":{"dur":5,"text":"business person who happens to have a specialisation\nin human resources management. I think that"},"357":{"dur":4,"text":"broad based approach has some real merits\nwhen it comes to potentially dealing with"},"361":{"dur":3,"text":"career challenges further on down the line.\nObviously no one really knows what changes"},"365":{"dur":4,"text":"or challenges are going to come up in their\ncareer, and this broad foundation really does"},"369":{"dur":4,"text":"put you in very good stead for being able\nto deal with those. Now one thing to emphasise,"},"374":{"dur":4,"text":"that system is only applicable to generalist\ndegrees, so Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of"},"378":{"dur":4,"text":"Commerce, Bachelor of Science. If you're going\nto do a professional course such as say the"},"383":{"dur":4,"text":"Bachelor of Engineering, or the Bachelor of\nSurgery\/ Bachelor of Medicine, you're going"},"387":{"dur":4,"text":"to be following a very set structured study\nprogram. There is going to be very little"},"392":{"dur":4,"text":"opportunity, or even no opportunity, to take\nelective subjects. However I think you can"},"396":{"dur":4,"text":"see here the same principle of broad based\neducation coming through. So a Bachelor of"},"401":{"dur":5,"text":"Engineering in Australia or New Zealand is a four year program. During the first year the"},"406":{"dur":5,"text":"whole cohort, the whole engineering cohort\ntakes these papers, these introductory engineering"},"411":{"dur":4,"text":"papers before then splitting off into their\nspecialisations in second, third, and fourth"},"415":{"dur":4,"text":"year. So you will split into a civil stream,\na mechanical engineering stream, and so on"},"420":{"dur":3,"text":"and so forth. But that first year everybody\nundertakes those papers."},"426":{"dur":3,"text":"Another key difference to be aware of. The\nteaching culture is quite different in Australia"},"429":{"dur":4,"text":"and New Zealand, for undergraduate students they have a big emphasis on the importance"},"434":{"dur":5,"text":"of undergraduate teaching. In the UK we have\na very strong tradition of self-directed learning"},"439":{"dur":4,"text":"at university level. Now that is usually a\neuphemism for the onus being very much on"},"444":{"dur":4,"text":"the student to get down to the library and\nreally kind of taking on that learning themselves."},"448":{"dur":4,"text":"So you tend to have a relatively low number\nof contact teaching hours with academics at"},"453":{"dur":5,"text":"UK universities, particularly for say, an\nArts and Humanities student. The Australian"},"458":{"dur":5,"text":"and New Zealand system is something of a halfway house, between the UK approach and the"},"464":{"dur":7,"text":"US approach, where in America you have a very, very hand held type approach by the academics"},"471":{"dur":4,"text":"particularly in your first and second year. So the Aussies and Kiwis are somewhere in"},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"the middle, so you're going to have a higher number of contact teaching hours"},"479":{"dur":4,"text":"than you would in the UK, but you're going to have more independence and the onus is going to be"},"484":{"dur":7,"text":"on you far more than it would be at say a US university. I think also there is a repeated bit of feedback that we"},"491":{"dur":4,"text":"get from our students who go to Australia\nand New Zealand, just to say how accessible"},"495":{"dur":5,"text":"they find the academics, how easy it is to get support if you need some extra help or"},"500":{"dur":4,"text":"if you've got a query about something that\nyou've heard in class. So you very much see"},"504":{"dur":5,"text":"an open door policy for academic offices, peoples emails being given out very freely,"},"509":{"dur":4,"text":"and a lot of our students say they really appreciate that, they really appreciate the"},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"academic support that they receive at the\nuniversities."},"518":{"dur":6,"text":"Okay, the next thing, the universities have\na very, very strong focus on the student experience."},"524":{"dur":5,"text":"So they essentially offer up an enormous range\nof opportunities and experiences that you"},"530":{"dur":4,"text":"can choose whether or not you want to take\nadvantage of to really maximize your time"},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"at university. Now I've just given a couple\nof examples here. Obviously student clubs"},"538":{"dur":4,"text":"and societies, you'd expect to find those\nat any well established university in the"},"542":{"dur":4,"text":"world really, but you'll also find that these\nuniversities offer you the chance to get involved"},"546":{"dur":4,"text":"with community projects, with volunteering\nin your local community, they also have very"},"551":{"dur":4,"text":"strong outbound exchange networks with other\nuniversities around the globe, so if you don't"},"555":{"dur":3,"text":"feel that you've gone far enough already,\nyou can certainly build in an even greater"},"559":{"dur":4,"text":"international dimension into your undergraduate\ndegree by studying for either a semester or"},"564":{"dur":5,"text":"a full year at one of their partner institutions.\nRecently we've seen quite a few students for"},"569":{"dur":4,"text":"example taking an exchange semester from say\nand Australian or New Zealand university to"},"574":{"dur":5,"text":"say one of the universities in China or elsewhere\nin South-East Asia to get that Asian business"},"579":{"dur":4,"text":"experience. Obviously with an eye to where they might want their career to take them going forwards."},"584":{"dur":5,"text":"But certainly the opportunities for exchange,\nfor example Will's university would have a"},"589":{"dur":5,"text":"network of exchange partners that span North\nAmerica, Europe, Asia, really anywhere in"},"594":{"dur":3,"text":"the world that you want to take that experience\nup at."},"597":{"dur":5,"text":"Okay, obviously I don't think it would be\na presentation about Australia and New Zealand"},"602":{"dur":5,"text":"without a few pretty pictures. The other huge\ndraw to these countries is the lifestyle that's"},"608":{"dur":3,"text":"available to students. Obviously your student\nexperience is not just about the course that"},"612":{"dur":3,"text":"you study, not just about the university you\ngo to, it's what else you want to do with"},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"your time once you're not in the library,\nbecause obviously you'll be all the time at"},"619":{"dur":6,"text":"university I'm sure. So certainly the chance\nto experience the great outdoors to really"},"625":{"dur":4,"text":"experience a different lifestyle a different\nculture for quite an extended period of time"},"630":{"dur":6,"text":"is a huge draw for students coming from the\nUK. Just a quick slide about the quality of"},"636":{"dur":3,"text":"the education that's available in Australia\nand New Zealand. This is obviously really"},"640":{"dur":4,"text":"key. If you're going to go all that way and\npay what is a considerable amount of money"},"644":{"dur":3,"text":"in tuition fees, you need to know that the\nqualification that you're getting at the end"},"648":{"dur":6,"text":"of it is going to be well regarded and recognised\nworld wide. Now I could safely say that the"},"654":{"dur":5,"text":"Australian and New Zealand quality of education\nis absolutely excellent. A large number of"},"660":{"dur":4,"text":"these universities feature in the international\nrankings systems, obviously ranking systems"},"665":{"dur":3,"text":"should always be taken with a pinch of salt\nbut they are equally very helpful in terms"},"668":{"dur":5,"text":"of getting an idea of where certain universities\nsit in the global scheme of things. We use"},"674":{"dur":3,"text":"three different ranking systems and we'd always\nrecommend that students look at a couple of"},"678":{"dur":4,"text":"different ones to get a really balanced picture.\nSo the three we use are the QS rankings, the"},"682":{"dur":3,"text":"Times Higher Education, and the Shanghai Jiao\nTong which is issued by a Chinese university"},"686":{"dur":4,"text":"or a Chinese think-tank. The universities\nin Australia and New Zealand are considered"},"690":{"dur":5,"text":"to be world leaders in a very wide number\nof subjects areas. So if you actually drill"},"696":{"dur":5,"text":"down in those international rankings and look\nat subject rankings, individual subject rankings"},"701":{"dur":5,"text":"sorry, you will see how strongly regarded\nthey are in different academic areas."},"706":{"dur":7,"text":"Okay, a few practicalities. The similarity\nbetween the systems again is a big advantage"},"713":{"dur":4,"text":"here. It means that the application process\nis very straightforward. There are no additional"},"718":{"dur":4,"text":"tests. So when you apply to these universities,\nyou'll be applying on the basis of your A"},"722":{"dur":7,"text":"Levels, your IB, your UK issued degree, any\nUK qualification. The only degrees that have"},"729":{"dur":5,"text":"additional requirements are Medicine, Dentistry,\nand performance-based subjects which require"},"735":{"dur":7,"text":"a portfolio or an audition-tape in some cases.\nIn terms of lodging your applications, that's"},"743":{"dur":5,"text":"where my organisation comes in, that's what\nwe do. So once you've selected the courses"},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"that you might want to apply to, the universities\nyou might want to apply to, we actually issue"},"751":{"dur":3,"text":"you the application forms that you'll need\nand give you a checklist of the documents"},"755":{"dur":3,"text":"that are going to be required to put your\napplication together. We'd like to reiterate again at this"},"758":{"dur":3,"text":"point that Study Options is a completely free service, everything that we do is funded by the universities"},"763":{"dur":8,"text":"that we work with. Okay, so a quick look at costs you'll need to budget for tuition fees and living expenses"},"771":{"dur":5,"text":"during your time in Australia or New Zealand.\nPlease note that each university does set"},"777":{"dur":5,"text":"it's own tuition fees for each individual\ncourse. So unlike the UK where we generally"},"782":{"dur":5,"text":"have pretty much a blanket cost of \u00a39,000\na year, these universities have different"},"787":{"dur":4,"text":"fees for each individual degree that they\noffer. One of the really key things that we"},"792":{"dur":5,"text":"do is we issue you course lists, so if anyone\nwants to know, for example, what courses are"},"798":{"dur":4,"text":"available in Engineering, if you just drop\nus an email we can send you a list of every"},"802":{"dur":3,"text":"single engineering degree that is taught throughout\nAustralia and New Zealand. Please look at"},"806":{"dur":3,"text":"those very carefully, it will give individual\ncosts on those course lists, and as you'll"},"810":{"dur":3,"text":"see there is quite a bit of variation. Not\nso much in New Zealand, they do tend to be"},"813":{"dur":3,"text":"a bit more uniform in what they charge, but\ncertainly in Australia you will see quite"},"817":{"dur":5,"text":"a wide range of costs being quoted. The other\nthing to think about is the difference in"},"822":{"dur":4,"text":"living costs in different locations in both\ncountries. There is a world of difference"},"827":{"dur":3,"text":"between the living costs that you'll incur\nstudying in say Dunedin, where the University"},"830":{"dur":4,"text":"of Otago is located, and the living costs\nyou'd incur in Aukland, which is New Zealand's"},"835":{"dur":4,"text":"biggest city and has a much higher cost of\nliving, generally speaking."},"839":{"dur":7,"text":"You can work on a student visa in both these\ncountries, up to 20 hours per week. Or well"},"847":{"dur":3,"text":"the Australians now say it's 40 hours a fortnight,\nI'm not quite sure why they've changed the"},"850":{"dur":6,"text":"actual wording of that. But you can work,\nthis is usually very helpful when it comes"},"856":{"dur":5,"text":"to meeting the cost of living, but it's not\nenough to pay tuition fees, unless you are"},"862":{"dur":3,"text":"already qualified as a doctor or a physiotherapist,\nand you can do some very highly paid"},"866":{"dur":4,"text":"work. General student employment is not going\nto pay enough to pay for your tuition fees,"},"871":{"dur":4,"text":"so you do need to have those organised and\nsorted before you leave the island."},"878":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is a little snapshot of the University\nof Otago, just before Will leads on with his"},"882":{"dur":5,"text":"presentation. So these are our contact details,\nso as I said Study Options is the organisation"},"888":{"dur":4,"text":"responsible for processing applications to\nAustralian and New Zealand universities. We"},"892":{"dur":5,"text":"are a free service for students, and parents,\nand schools. We have two offices in the UK,"},"898":{"dur":5,"text":"in London and in Bristol, but we also are\nregular visitors to Jersey, so for example"},"903":{"dur":4,"text":"the next time I'm on the island will be in\nMarch 2014 for the Higher Education event"},"908":{"dur":5,"text":"that's held at Hautlieu School. But please\ndo drop us an email, give us a call with any"},"913":{"dur":3,"text":"questions that you might have, or to ask for\na course list for a particular subject area,"},"917":{"dur":4,"text":"we're really happy to send those through.\nWe do also hold open days for the Australian"},"922":{"dur":4,"text":"and New Zealand universities, so we tour five\ncities in the UK, that happens the first week"},"926":{"dur":4,"text":"of June and we actually have representatives\nwith us from usually around 23-24 of the Australian"},"931":{"dur":3,"text":"and New Zealand universities. So if you guys\nare interested in finding out more and talking"},"935":{"dur":4,"text":"to the representatives in person, that can\nbe a very, very useful event to come and attend."},"940":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, I'm going to hand over to Will."},"943":{"dur":2,"text":"T\u00ebn\u00e4 koutou katoa"},"947":{"dur":4,"text":"Does anyone know what language I spoke?
