audience."},"55":{"dur":2,"text":"So I-- I got him to drop out."},"60":{"dur":1,"text":"The true thing--\nyou know, I ended up"},"62":{"dur":4,"text":"going a total of three years,\nand I took a lot of courses."},"67":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'm not really a\ndrop out in the sense"},"69":{"dur":2,"text":"that I fled the university."},"71":{"dur":1,"text":"I was having so much fun."},"72":{"dur":2,"text":"It was just that it seemed\nlike, unless we got in"},"75":{"dur":3,"text":"on the ground floor, we were\ngoing to miss the opportunity."},"78":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, when you\napplied to college,"},"80":{"dur":2,"text":"you applied to Harvard,\nYale, and Princeton."},"82":{"dur":2,"text":"And suppose you hadn't\ngotten into Harvard,"},"85":{"dur":2,"text":"and you'd only gotten\ninto Yale and Princeton."},"87":{"dur":2,"text":"Do you think the value of\nbeing a drop out of Yale"},"89":{"dur":5,"text":"or a drop out at Princeton\nwould have been as valuable?"},"94":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, there's the prestige of\nturning Harvard down, which--"},"97":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't have that."},"100":{"dur":1,"text":"So you've got--\nfamously, you got--"},"102":{"dur":1,"text":"you did very well on\nstandardized tests."},"103":{"dur":2,"text":"You got 1590 out of 1600."},"106":{"dur":1,"text":"Have you ever thought\nwhat that

first time."},"115":{"dur":4,"text":"I told my parents their\nvocabulary wasn't large enough."},"120":{"dur":1,"text":"And I was criticizing them."},"122":{"dur":4,"text":"So I did go back and take it,\nand do better the next time."},"127":{"dur":1,"text":"OK."},"128":{"dur":2,"text":"So when you were at\nHarvard, you did enjoy it,"},"130":{"dur":3,"text":"but you were famous for\nplaying a lot of poker."},"133":{"dur":2,"text":"You were famous for\nauditing a lot of courses."},"136":{"dur":2,"text":"And famous for not attending\nthe courses that you"},"138":{"dur":1,"text":"were supposed to be taking."},"140":{"dur":2,"text":"So what would you say was\nthe great experience you had,"},"142":{"dur":2,"text":"and what you learned\nthe most out of Harvard?"},"145":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, you know, when\nyou come to Harvard,"},"147":{"dur":2,"text":"there are so many\nbrilliant people."},"149":{"dur":3,"text":"And for a lot of people in\nyour high school realm--"},"152":{"dur":2,"text":"and you probably have\nfairly key positioning."},"155":{"dur":3,"text":"You're one of the more studious,\none of the better at math"},"158":{"dur":0,"text":"or science--"},"159":{"dur":5,"text":"you have something that people\nunderstand your positioning."},"165":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, when I came to Harvard,\nin my freshman class,"},"168":{"dur":3,"text":"we had 80 people in\none class, all of whom"},"171":{"dur":3,"text":"personal positioning was,\nI am the best math person."},"174":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we had 79 frauds."},"177":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I thought, well,\nI'm probably not going"},"180":{"dur":1,"text":"to be the best at this."},"181":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, a great\nguy, Andy Braiterman,"},"185":{"dur":4,"text":"who's a lawyer in New York,\nwas first in that class."},"189":{"dur":2,"text":"So I decided I would be\nthe guy who never attended"},"192":{"dur":2,"text":"any class he was signed up for."},"194":{"dur":2,"text":"So within my first\nmonth, I figured out"},"197":{"dur":2,"text":"that was my unique positioning."},"200":{"dur":2,"text":"And I hoped that 80\nother people wouldn't"},"202":{"dur":1,"text":"steal that positioning."},"204":{"dur":4,"text":"But it turned out no\none else imitated me."},"208":{"dur":2,"text":"But you started out, you were\ngoing to be a math major,"},"211":{"dur":1,"text":"and you finally\nrealized there might"},"213":{"dur":1,"text":"be somebody better in\nmath, so you decided"},"214":{"dur":1,"text":"to be an applied math major."},"215":{"dur":0,"text":"Is that true?"},"216":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, there were certainly\npeople better than me at math."},"219":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, I took the\nPutnam and scored well,"},"222":{"dur":2,"text":"but not at the top."},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"The main reason I\nswitched to applied math"},"226":{"dur":3,"text":"was that Harvard had this\nstrange rule, that you--"},"230":{"dur":2,"text":"if you were trying\nto get into a class,"},"232":{"dur":2,"text":"like some movie class, or\npolitical science class that"},"234":{"dur":3,"text":"was very crowded, if you\nwere in applied math,"},"238":{"dur":3,"text":"you could pretend to be\napplying math to that domain,"},"241":{"dur":2,"text":"and be treated as though\nyou were a student majoring"},"243":{"dur":1,"text":"in that field."},"245":{"dur":1,"text":"But they never pinned you down."},"246":{"dur":4,"text":"So you could use it as\na kind of wild card."},"250":{"dur":1,"text":"And there were a bunch\nof economics courses"},"252":{"dur":2,"text":"I wanted to get into,\nincluding Mike Spence's"},"255":{"dur":2,"text":"micro-economic course,\nthat I would not"},"257":{"dur":2,"text":"have been able to\nget into unless I"},"259":{"dur":2,"text":"could say I was applying\napplied math to economics."},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"So it was a great choice."},"265":{"dur":0,"text":"OK."},"266":{"dur":3,"text":"So when you gave your--"},"269":{"dur":2,"text":"you received an honorary\ndegree from Duke-- from, uh,"},"271":{"dur":1,"text":"from Harvard a few years ago--"},"273":{"dur":1,"text":"[AUDIENCE GROANS]"},"275":{"dur":1,"text":"--his wife-- his\nwife went to Duke."},"277":{"dur":1,"text":"She has a real degree."},"278":{"dur":1,"text":"Actually, she has two."},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"His wife got the honorary\ndegree from Duke this year,"},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"and you got an honorary degree\na few years ago from Harvard."},"285":{"dur":5,"text":"And in that, you said that you\nwanted to be in the Radcliffe--"},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"the dorms, because you\nconcluded that there"},"293":{"dur":1,"text":"were more women than\nmen there, and you"},"295":{"dur":4,"text":"had a better chance of scoring\na date if you were in Radcliffe."},"299":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, it's still a\nvery, very low chance."},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"So it didn't work out."},"304":{"dur":1,"text":"They had hamburgers, too."},"305":{"dur":1,"text":"You could get\nhamburgers for lunch,"},"306":{"dur":1,"text":"no matter what\nthey were serving."},"308":{"dur":2,"text":"That was exciting."},"311":{"dur":3,"text":"Obviously, you\nfamously left Harvard."},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"Your parents-- when you called\nyour parents up and said,"},"317":{"dur":3,"text":"look, I'm going to drop out\nof Harvard, what did they say?"},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, you never say that\nyou're dropping out of Harvard."},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, I went on\nleave from Harvard."},"326":{"dur":4,"text":"And so if things hadn't\nworked out for my company,"},"330":{"dur":3,"text":"for Microsoft, I could\nhave always come back."},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, eventually they changed the\ncourse catalog and requirements"},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"enough, nobody would\nknow what it would mean."},"339":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was so close\nto graduating."},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"So, you know, my parents\nprobably thought within a year"},"344":{"dur":4,"text":"or so the thing would collapse\nand I'd be, like, a year off."},"349":{"dur":1,"text":"Like studying\nabroad or something."},"350":{"dur":2,"text":"But had-- the truth is, had\nyou graduated and stayed,"},"353":{"dur":1,"text":"would it have made a difference?"},"355":{"dur":1,"text":"In other words, would\nthe world be different"},"356":{"dur":1,"text":"because you couldn't\nhave started"},"357":{"dur":2,"text":"your company by graduated,\nhaving not dropped out, or not?"},"360":{"dur":3,"text":"No, it turns out that\nthe urgency we felt--"},"364":{"dur":4,"text":"that if we hadn't\nstarted in 1979--"},"369":{"dur":4,"text":"if we'd waited and started\nin 1980, or even 1981?"},"373":{"dur":3,"text":"Because of the way we\nthought about the problem,"},"376":{"dur":3,"text":"because we were so\nsoftware-oriented,"},"380":{"dur":1,"text":"and thought it--"},"381":{"dur":3,"text":"and most companies weren't\nfocused on software."},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"People did software as sort of\na side deal because they had to."},"388":{"dur":2,"text":"But the hardware was what\nyou paid all the money for."},"390":{"dur":1,"text":"The software just came free."},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"So the idea of\nsoftware companies"},"395":{"dur":1,"text":"wasn't around all that much."},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"So we-- in fact,\nalthough we felt"},"399":{"dur":4,"text":"like we had to do it\nthat day, an extra year"},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"would have-- would have been OK."},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"It wouldn't have changed\nthe course of history"},"408":{"dur":1,"text":"to hang out another year."},"409":{"dur":0,"text":"OK."},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"So when you started\nyour company,"},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"you were the chief software\nengineer, in effect--"},"415":{"dur":0,"text":"architect."},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"And you were also the CEO."},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"When you started it, to\nbe realistic about it,"},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"did you actually ever\nthink it could take off"},"422":{"dur":0,"text":"to the extent it did?"},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"Or what did you think\nthe realistic goal was?"},"426":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, I had what you might call\nan inconsistent view, which"},"431":{"dur":1,"text":"worked out very well."},"432":{"dur":3,"text":"One view was that there'll\nbe a computer on every desk"},"436":{"dur":3,"text":"and in every home\nrunning our software."},"439":{"dur":4,"text":"And so that would be billions\nof copies of our software."},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"And that our-- we should\ndo everything for that."},"447":{"dur":4,"text":"But then when it came to\nspending money, renting things,"},"452":{"dur":3,"text":"I had a view that, OK, maybe\nwe could triple in size."},"455":{"dur":3,"text":"And I ought to do enough in\nterms of how I structured"},"458":{"dur":3,"text":"things, to triple in size."},"461":{"dur":1,"text":"So that was kind of my man--"},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"there was my vision,\nwhich was grand."},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"My management view,\nwhich was to triple."},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"And then there was my,\nOK, do we have enough cash"},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"if nobody pays us?"},"471":{"dur":1,"text":"So I always liked to have--"},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"because we had a few\ncustomers go bankrupt,"},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"because being in the personal\ncomputer hardware business"},"478":{"dur":1,"text":"was pretty chaotic."},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"I always wanted to\nhave enough cash"},"481":{"dur":1,"text":"to pay everybody for a year."},"483":{"dur":1,"text":"And still, to this\nday, Microsoft"},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"has enough cash to pay\neverybody for a year."},"488":{"dur":1,"text":"More than a year, I'd think."},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah, more than a year."},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"So when you started,\nhow did you avoid"},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"what so many other entrepreneurs\nare unable to avoid,"},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"which is taking venture capital\nmoney and diluting themselves?"},"501":{"dur":1,"text":"You didn't really take\nventure capital money."},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"How did you avoid that?"},"504":{"dur":5,"text":"We got-- software, if you\ncan sell it in volume,"},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"has extremely\nfavorable economics."},"512":{"dur":4,"text":"Because the costs\nare quite finite,"},"516":{"dur":3,"text":"and you can scale the\nvolume, in our case,"},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"to sell millions of copies."},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, every\nApple II computer,"},"524":{"dur":4,"text":"Commodore Pad, IBM PC, had\ncopies of our software."},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"So our income went up a lot."},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"So we didn't have to\nbuild any factories."},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"We were cash positive."},"536":{"dur":3,"text":"And we didn't have a\nyear where we lost money."},"539":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, the first few\nyears, OK, Paul and I"},"541":{"dur":1,"text":"worked for free--"},"542":{"dur":1,"text":"Paul Allen, who\nwas my co-founder."},"544":{"dur":3,"text":"But after that, we were\njust generating cash."},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"We eventually gave away--"},"550":{"dur":4,"text":"or sold-- 5% of the\ncompany for a $1,000,000--"},"554":{"dur":1,"text":"so a $20 million valuation--"},"556":{"dur":4,"text":"just to get a venture capital\ncompany to join our board,"},"560":{"dur":4,"text":"and give us some adult\nadvice about various things."},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"Which actually was--\nwas quite helpful."},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"We picked one in the Valley--"},"568":{"dur":1,"text":"a guy named Dave Marquardt\ncame on our board"},"570":{"dur":1,"text":"and did a fantastic job."},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"That money sat in the bank."},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"It's still in the bank today."},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"So it was not for anything\nto do with capital,"},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"but rather just\nto join the team."},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"And he's still on the board."},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"He's still on the\nboard [INAUDIBLE]"},"583":{"dur":4,"text":"and is still extremely helpful\nas a lot of important decisions"},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"So when you were\nstarting, Steve Jobs"},"590":{"dur":3,"text":"was also starting his\ncompany, not long after."},"593":{"dur":0,"text":"Yeah."},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"He was in India when we started."},"596":{"dur":0,"text":"Yeah."},"597":{"dur":3,"text":"So when his software was\ndeveloped at one point,"},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"it was thought to be\nvery good software,"},"602":{"dur":1,"text":"but he didn't want\nto license it."},"604":{"dur":1,"text":"Was that helpful to you?"},"606":{"dur":3,"text":"Because his software was so\ngood at that time that your--"},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"if he had licensed it, there\nwould have been no need for IBM"},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"or others to license\nyour software?"},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a little complicated."},"616":{"dur":1,"text":"So there's three phase of Apple."},"618":{"dur":4,"text":"There's the Apple II\nera, where Wozniak did--"},"622":{"dur":1,"text":"Steve Wozniak, who\nis a great engineer--"},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"did the Apple I software."},"625":{"dur":4,"text":"Then he got kind of lazy,\nor wasn't focused on it."},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"So I got to do the\nApple II Basic,"},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"and licensed that to Apple."},"635":{"dur":4,"text":"Then there's the Mac era, where\nthey did all their own system"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"software, and we were\nthe big application"},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"provider for the Mac."},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"And because we were doing so\nwell with our Mac application"},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"software, we kept telling\nApple they should license"},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"their software to other people."},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"Because it would have\nbeen better for Microsoft."},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"Although ironically, that\nwould have had competed"},"655":{"dur":1,"text":"with MS-DOS and Windows."},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"They, for a while,\nthought about doing it,"},"659":{"dur":3,"text":"and then chose not to do that."},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"And then-- then comes\nthe era of, sort of,"},"664":{"dur":4,"text":"post-Mac, where they do\nall the different things,"},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"and still keep it\nproprietary to them."},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"So truthfully, if they had\ndone it in the Mac era,"},"674":{"dur":1,"text":"that would have\nbeen good for us,"},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"because our applications\nshare was so--"},"678":{"dur":0,"text":"so strong."},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"And we totally believed\nin the licensing model."},"682":{"dur":5,"text":"Today, Windows and Android\nfollow the licensing model,"},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"and have a very high share."},"689":{"dur":4,"text":"Although Apple's managed,\non a reasonably modest share"},"693":{"dur":3,"text":"by our standards, to make an\nincredible amount of money."},"696":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, IBM decided to build a PC,\nand they wanted to get somebody"},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"to provide the software."},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"They thought, I guess, that\nhardware was the most important"},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"thing, and they'll have some\nsoftware provided by somebody."},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"How did you manage\nto get that contract,"},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"and do you think IBM\nmade a mistake by not"},"711":{"dur":1,"text":"buying the software\nfrom you, as opposed"},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"to licensing it from you?"},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"They certainly made a mistake."},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"But they-- you know, IBM is a\ngreat company that's done many,"},"723":{"dur":1,"text":"many great things."},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"The actual project\nthat did the IBM PC"},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"was started by the IBM\nmanagement committee,"},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"more to prove that they\ncould do products quickly."},"733":{"dur":1,"text":"They were seeing\nfour year cycles"},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"between when they\ndecided to do something"},"736":{"dur":1,"text":"and something shipped."},"738":{"dur":1,"text":"So they had a\nfacility in Florida,"},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"Boca Raton, that had\ndone a product systems,"},"742":{"dur":1,"text":"hadn't done well."},"743":{"dur":3,"text":"So they told them, you guys,\ndo a personal computer,"},"746":{"dur":1,"text":"and try and do it in 18 months."},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"And your strategy is going\nto be to use third parties."},"751":{"dur":3,"text":"So they went to Intel for the\nchip, UPS for the software,"},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"a group called Computerland\nfor the distribution,"},"757":{"dur":3,"text":"and the goal was just\nto do it really quickly."},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"So we wrote the\nsoftware for that."},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"The volume protections\nthey had for it were, like,"},"764":{"dur":3,"text":"200,000 or 300,000 units\nover a three year period."},"768":{"dur":1,"text":"So they didn't view\nit as important."},"770":{"dur":3,"text":"Ironically then, that\nthing was hyper successful."},"773":{"dur":1,"text":"And so the divisions--"},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"the dedicated word processor,\nthe small business machine--"},"777":{"dur":3,"text":"they got completely taken over\nby this tiny little group."},"781":{"dur":1,"text":"And so the fact that\nthey didn't know"},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"it was going to be\nsuch high volume"},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"meant that the way they\nnegotiated with us--"},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"we thought it was going\nto be super high volume,"},"789":{"dur":1,"text":"and they didn't."},"791":{"dur":3,"text":"And, you know, then\nthat can lead to them"},"794":{"dur":1,"text":"thinking they got a good deal."},"796":{"dur":1,"text":"Which they didn't."},"797":{"dur":0,"text":"OK."},"798":{"dur":3,"text":"So in those days, you were\na rival, a bit, for Apple,"},"802":{"dur":1,"text":"to some extent, with Steve Jobs."},"803":{"dur":2,"text":"But at one point,\nhe needed money,"},"805":{"dur":2,"text":"and you put up some\nmoney to bail out Apple."},"807":{"dur":3,"text":"What was that like, when he had\nto come to you to get money?"},"811":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, yeah."},"813":{"dur":3,"text":"So in the Apple II era,\nwe did software for them,"},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"and we were kind of\nfriendly competitors."},"819":{"dur":2,"text":"Then when they started\nthe Mac, Steve came to us."},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"And we actually put more people\non the Mac than Apple had,"},"824":{"dur":2,"text":"because we wanted to do\nall this application stuff."},"827":{"dur":2,"text":"So we were really\nvery much partners."},"829":{"dur":1,"text":"Then Steve gets kicked\nout of the company."},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"He's not the CEO during\nthat period at all,"},"832":{"dur":2,"text":"but he is the head\nof the Mac project."},"835":{"dur":1,"text":"And so we're working closely."},"837":{"dur":2,"text":"Then Sculley comes\nin, he's gone."},"839":{"dur":3,"text":"Then there's this management\nthat wasn't doing so well."},"843":{"dur":3,"text":"That was negotiating with\nus on a bunch of things."},"846":{"dur":1,"text":"And it was taking forever."},"848":{"dur":2,"text":"I think it'd been a\nyear of negotiation."},"850":{"dur":3,"text":"And so when Steve comes\nand takes over the company,"},"854":{"dur":2,"text":"he sort of said, hey, of the--"},"856":{"dur":1,"text":"I want it this, this,\nand this, and I'm going"},"858":{"dur":1,"text":"to give this, this, and this."},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"So we did the deal\nin three days."},"861":{"dur":1,"text":"Including putting\nmoney into the company."},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"We bought, I think,\n6% of Apple, which"},"866":{"dur":1,"text":"our lawyers thought,\nfor anti-trust reasons,"},"868":{"dur":1,"text":"we shouldn't hold on to."},"869":{"dur":2,"text":"It would've been nice if we had."},"872":{"dur":2,"text":"But we mostly,\nbesides the cash, we"},"875":{"dur":2,"text":"committed to do our Mac\napplication software,"},"877":{"dur":1,"text":"and really support the company."},"879":{"dur":2,"text":"And then Steve, through\ngreat management,"},"881":{"dur":1,"text":"turned the company around."},"882":{"dur":3,"text":"First on the Mac, and then\ndid a bunch of new products"},"885":{"dur":2,"text":"that made it extremely valuable."},"888":{"dur":2,"text":"Before all that happened,\nyou took your company public,"},"890":{"dur":2,"text":"I think, in 1986, or so."},"892":{"dur":0,"text":"Exactly."},"893":{"dur":1,"text":"And you were 31."},"895":{"dur":1,"text":"More or less."},"896":{"dur":2,"text":"So you're 31 years old, and\nyou're very, very wealthy,"},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"at least on paper."},"902":{"dur":2,"text":"Did you think at the time that\nthe company could actually get"},"904":{"dur":1,"text":"much bigger than it had been?"},"906":{"dur":1,"text":"And did you realize\nhow wealthy you were?"},"907":{"dur":0,"text":"Did it change your life?"},"908":{"dur":1,"text":"Or you just kept working\nas hard as before."},"910":{"dur":1,"text":"You didn't really pursue\nany outside activities"},"912":{"dur":3,"text":"after you realized how\nwealthy you'd become at 31?"},"915":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, I was very\nfanatical about the job."},"921":{"dur":1,"text":"And so there wasn't\nany spare time."},"922":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, in my 20s,\nI didn't believe"},"924":{"dur":1,"text":"in vacation or
