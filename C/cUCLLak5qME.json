important"},"209":{"dur":3,"text":"to take advantage \u2013 just a very quick intro\nhere."},"212":{"dur":6,"text":"So, I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to specialise\nin integrated digital marketing

we\u2019ve always done is to look at how\nyou can align digital marketing with traditional"},"229":{"dur":1,"text":"marketing."},"230":{"dur":6,"text":"So, we look, for example, in there at segmentation,\ntargeting, positioning, developing, integrated"},"236":{"dur":1,"text":"communications strategies."},"238":{"dur":6,"text":"And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve continued to do\nin our

going to focus in particular\nis not so much trends that are interesting."},"301":{"dur":7,"text":"There\u2019s a lot of chat about the bots, marketing\nbots, and how they\u2019re going to be important"},"309":{"dur":1,"text":"in the future."},"310":{"dur":4,"text":"But I think the reality is they\u2019re not going\nto give much impact to businesses like yours,"},"315":{"dur":1,"text":"whoever you work for."},"317":{"dur":5,"text":"But we will touch on those, because they are\ninteresting, I think, even if it\u2019s just"},"322":{"dur":1,"text":"to debunk the hype."},"323":{"dur":5,"text":"So, we\u2019re going to look at five different\ntrends at a top level and then we\u2019ll drill"},"328":{"dur":5,"text":"down within those to look at some specific\ntechniques and some examples of what B2B brands"},"334":{"dur":7,"text":"are doing now, and look at some of the tools\nthat are available."},"342":{"dur":3,"text":"I think it\u2019s one of the great things of\nworking in marketing today that there are"},"346":{"dur":5,"text":"a lot of free and low-cost tools that you\ncan use to get an edge on your

that."},"363":{"dur":5,"text":"But to kick off, I\u2019d like to start with\na poll, just to see... really get your view"},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"on what\u2019s important in business to

there."},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"Thanks for voting, everyone."},"412":{"dur":5,"text":"It\u2019s interesting that big data, there\u2019s\na lot of hype on that and yet it\u2019s quite"},"417":{"dur":1,"text":"popular."},"418":{"dur":4,"text":"I think it\u2019s this desire where to mine customer\ninsight and predictive analytics, and we\u2019ll"},"423":{"dur":6,"text":"look at

marketing\nso high."},"435":{"dur":6,"text":"I\u2019m a little surprised that the marketing\nautomation isn\u2019t higher, because we\u2019ve"},"441":{"dur":6,"text":"actually done some research recently, where\nwe\u2019re partnering with HubSpot, the marketing"},"448":{"dur":4,"text":"automation provider, and you can see there\nwe\u2019ve got similar answers to what you\u2019ve"},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"just given there."},"454":{"dur":6,"text":"We asked about more activities; we just chose\nthe top five for yourselves."},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"But you can see it\u2019s quite a similar pattern."},"463":{"dur":5,"text":"So, we will actually be covering all of those\ntop five, looking at examples of those and"},"469":{"dur":4,"text":"including social media as well."},"474":{"dur":4,"text":"I mentioned the marketing bots."},"478":{"dur":7,"text":"In 2016 in particular, there\u2019s been a lot\nof hype about this, because there was a particular"},"485":{"dur":7,"text":"episode where Microsoft introduced a bot and\nit hit the media because it was a chatbot"},"493":{"dur":8,"text":"but it had this character developed, and it\nturned out it was a neo-Nazi bot \u2013 so not"},"501":{"dur":6,"text":"really what Microsoft would have wanted there."},"508":{"dur":5,"text":"I think it shows the dangers, perhaps, of\nwhere you use technology rather than humans"},"513":{"dur":1,"text":"to answer questions."},"515":{"dur":7,"text":"But here we have MIT talking about how different\nsocial media sites in particular are using"},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"this."},"523":{"dur":8,"text":"We\u2019ve seen Facebook using bots within their\nMessenger; just this week we\u2019ve seen Google"},"532":{"dur":7,"text":"IO Conference

come"},"544":{"dur":1,"text":"through."},"546":{"dur":7,"text":"I think a nice application would be within\nusing analytics or predictive analytics, where"},"553":{"dur":6,"text":"you can ask questions about what the data\nis showing you in a natural language sense."},"560":{"dur":10,"text":"So, \u035eShow me all of the segments which we\u2019re\nunder-utilising in terms of our targeting"},"570":{"dur":7,"text":"at the moment?\u035f In the case of Smart Insights,\nit might come back and say, \u035eWell, you\u2019re"},"577":{"dur":5,"text":"not sending specific personalised messages\nto agency owners, but actually there\u2019s quite"},"583":{"dur":3,"text":"a big group of those\u035f\u2013 that\u2019s actually\nsomething we\u2019ve found through mining our"},"587":{"dur":4,"text":"own data, but agency owners in particular\nare important subscribers."},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"Smart Insights \u2013 The future of digital marketing\nin 2016 and beyond \u2013 transcript 3 I think"},"594":{"dur":3,"text":"the other use of bots is actually around automating\ntasks."},"598":{"dur":7,"text":"It\u2019s a bit like that and it\u2019s more around\nautomating tasks, so it\u2019s part of marketing"},"606":{"dur":7,"text":"automation \u2013 which we\u2019ll talk of in a\nmoment."},"613":{"dur":6,"text":"The other brand or platform that\u2019s using\nbots and AI a lot is Google."},"620":{"dur":6,"text":"One of the trends \u2013it\u2019s actually from\nlast autumn \u2013 you may have seen is RankBrain."},"626":{"dur":6,"text":"What you may not know is I think it\u2019s around\n20-25% of Google\u2019s queries are now based"},"632":{"dur":8,"text":"on using artificial intelligence to try and\nglean the meaning from the searches, the intent."},"640":{"dur":6,"text":"So, I think one thing you should be looking\nat in your SEO strategy, or the details of"},"647":{"dur":6,"text":"your SEO, is how you can answer natural language\nqueries as people are asking them."},"653":{"dur":6,"text":"That goes back also to the Google Hummingbird\nalgorithm from a while back."},"660":{"dur":7,"text":"One thing that you can do is look within your\naudience the type of questions they\u2019re asking"},"667":{"dur":4,"text":"or things that they\u2019re interested in, and\nto see whether you can serve what Google called"},"671":{"dur":1,"text":"\u035equick answers\u035f."},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"There are two forms of these."},"674":{"dur":5,"text":"One I\u2019ve got on screen here is just a snippet\nwhere it will do a summary and it will often"},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"position that high in the search results."},"682":{"dur":6,"text":"I was talking on Monday about SOSTAC planning\nframework from P.R. Smith \u2013he\u2019s contributed"},"688":{"dur":4,"text":"to Smart Insights as well \u2013 and you can\nsee we\u2019ve got that box at the top explaining"},"693":{"dur":1,"text":"it with the graphic."},"695":{"dur":5,"text":"That gives us much more cut-through in the\nsearch results if someone is interested in"},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"that."},"701":{"dur":7,"text":"What you\u2019ll also see sometimes is grey boxes\nwhere there are three or four different answers"},"708":{"dur":5,"text":"to questions; so, it will say something like,\n\u035ePeople who ask about this also ask about"},"714":{"dur":6,"text":"the other different types of query\u035f\u2013 that\u2019s\nGoogle applying some predictive analytics."},"721":{"dur":7,"text":"If you can get in those slots, that\u2019s obviously\ngoing to help drive traffic and position you"},"728":{"dur":3,"text":"as a thought leader to some extent as well."},"731":{"dur":6,"text":"Now, I\u2019ve been looking at B2B marketing,\nhow people are using this move to more natural"},"738":{"dur":8,"text":"language theories, and I saw this on ClickZ\nthe publisher, the global search marketing"},"746":{"dur":5,"text":"at SAP has been looking at this and for their\npersona, if you had someone in a large organisation"},"752":{"dur":5,"text":"who was interested in investing in marketing\nautomation or CRM, what are the type of searches"},"758":{"dur":1,"text":"they would search."},"759":{"dur":5,"text":"If you look at the example we\u2019ve got on\nthe right, where someone is saying, \u035eFor"},"764":{"dur":5,"text":"a large organisation like mine, what should\nI be really looking for in enterprise CRM?"},"769":{"dur":8,"text":"What\u2019s out there?\u035f you can see Google has...\nthe first search it has returned is very much"},"778":{"dur":2,"text":"about that topic."},"780":{"dur":6,"text":"But for some of the other queries there, they\u2019re\nactually just about small business CRM."},"786":{"dur":5,"text":"So, Google hasn\u2019t quite got it right, but\ncertainly if you were a vendor of a CRM system"},"792":{"dur":7,"text":"that\u2019s a good place to be \u2013 but none of\nthe vendors are actually positioned there."},"800":{"dur":7,"text":"The AdWords results are at the top, of course,\nand I think AdWords is an example of where"},"807":{"dur":6,"text":"it\u2019s important to be on top of the latest\nchanges, because of course, just back last"},"813":{"dur":5,"text":"month, Google changed AdWords so that we no\nlonger have the ads in the right sidebar and"},"819":{"dur":6,"text":"it\u2019s just down to the top three positions\nin the search results page."},"826":{"dur":5,"text":"The guy from SAP didn\u2019t actually look at\nmarketing automation \u2013 here I actually swapped"},"832":{"dur":1,"text":"the terms."},"833":{"dur":4,"text":"And you can see Google isn\u2019t really that\nclever here because it\u2019s not managed to"},"837":{"dur":5,"text":"serve me any results about enterprise marketing\nautomation."},"843":{"dur":6,"text":"But maybe people aren\u2019t actually asking\nthat question, so they\u2019re not thinking like"},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"the customer does \u2013 maybe that\u2019s the issue\nthere."},"852":{"dur":6,"text":"And certainly, at Smart Insights we work really\nhard to...we\u2019ve got what we call a gap analysis"},"858":{"dur":5,"text":"spreadsheet that we make available for our\nexpert members, which looks at the Google"},"863":{"dur":5,"text":"Search Console and we can see exactly the\nsearch terms coming through to Smart Insights."},"868":{"dur":8,"text":"And we try to build on those because the reality\nis you probably get 80% of your search traffic"},"877":{"dur":4,"text":"in natural search from the top 20 posts."},"881":{"dur":7,"text":"So, it\u2019s a version of the 80\/20 rule, so\nwe really work hard to take our existing search"},"888":{"dur":2,"text":"that\u2019s working well and improve on that."},"890":{"dur":5,"text":"In fact, just this week Google have announced\nthat they\u2019re improving the integration of"},"895":{"dur":5,"text":"Google Search Console with Google Analytics,\nso you can see the keywords and whether they\u2019re"},"901":{"dur":1,"text":"converting now."},"902":{"dur":1,"text":"When I\u2019m doing training..."},"903":{"dur":1,"text":"I was doing some\nSmart Insights \u2013 The future of digital marketing"},"904":{"dur":5,"text":"in 2016 and beyond \u2013 transcript 4 training\non SEO this week and I found the company,"},"909":{"dur":4,"text":"like many, don\u2019t actually have that insight\nwithin the company; they think it\u2019s all"},"914":{"dur":2,"text":"blanked out and not provided."},"916":{"dur":4,"text":"So, again, the details matter to drive performance."},"920":{"dur":6,"text":"We\u2019ll spend the next half an hour or so\nlooking at the five trends that we looked"},"927":{"dur":3,"text":"at in the poll in the order of popularity,\nreally."},"930":{"dur":6,"text":"So, content marketing is still a massive trend\nand in Digital Week we had Joe Pulizzi of"},"937":{"dur":5,"text":"the Content Marketing Institute \u2013 many call\nhim the godfather of content marketing, he"},"942":{"dur":2,"text":"really originated the area."},"945":{"dur":6,"text":"So, do check out the recording of his talk\nor check out CMI if you don\u2019t know that."},"951":{"dur":7,"text":"At Smart Insights we focus a lot on content\nmarketing as well."},"958":{"dur":9,"text":"We\u2019ve produced guides, particularly on strategy\nand planning, and then done some joint resource"},"968":{"dur":6,"text":"with HubSpot to look at how the content marketing\nis used within Europe."},"974":{"dur":5,"text":"You can see the real challenge here, as you\nwould expect, is more and more people are"},"979":{"dur":9,"text":"devoting more resource, both in terms of in-house\nhires and agency input, to create more content."},"989":{"dur":6,"text":"The trend here is we\u2019re hitting what Mark\nSchaefer of Grow calls content shock."},"996":{"dur":9,"text":"So, really, you\u2019re missing out on the ability\nto get cut-through and many \u035eme too\u035fposts"},"1006":{"dur":6,"text":"just aren\u2019t getting the shares or the links\nback that the theory of content marketing"},"1012":{"dur":1,"text":"would show."},"1014":{"dur":5,"text":"So, I think my advice here is that you really\nhave to look at this as \u035eless is more\u035f,"},"1019":{"dur":6,"text":"develop a strategy where you really understand\nwhat resonates with the audience, and then"},"1026":{"dur":6,"text":"seek to be the very best you can within your\nsector of B2B."},"1032":{"dur":8,"text":"So, maybe rather than trying to do two blogs\nposts a week, you reduce that down to one"},"1041":{"dur":6,"text":"blog post every other week, but you just make\nit one of the best resources that\u2019s available."},"1048":{"dur":5,"text":"I\u2019ve seen that work, again, because the\nresearch shows in Google that most of the"},"1053":{"dur":5,"text":"first page results are actually more than\n2,000 words long."},"1059":{"dur":5,"text":"And if you look at someone like Avinash Kaushik,\nthe Google Evangelist on Digital Marketing,"},"1064":{"dur":6,"text":"he actually only blogs once a month but he\ndoes that sort of long-form content that works"},"1070":{"dur":1,"text":"really well."},"1071":{"dur":7,"text":"So, long-form content is definitely a trend\nif you want to get this cut-through in content"},"1078":{"dur":1,"text":"marketing."},"1079":{"dur":8,"text":"Do download our resource from HubSpot, if\nyou want to learn more."},"1087":{"dur":5,"text":"I talked about a more strategic approach to\ncontent marketing."},"1093":{"dur":7,"text":"Part of that is the type of content that you\nproduce and I\u2019d recommend here doing content"},"1100":{"dur":5,"text":"mapping so you really work out the gap between\ncontent you\u2019re producing now and what your"},"1106":{"dur":1,"text":"competitors are producing."},"1108":{"dur":6,"text":"So, look at that from left to right, matrix\nfrom awareness to purchase, map out what you"},"1115":{"dur":2,"text":"have, map out what the competitors have."},"1117":{"dur":5,"text":"And also look at the different styles of content,\nfrom the more emotional to rational."},"1123":{"dur":7,"text":"When I run this activity in workshops with\nB2B clients and members on Smart Insights,"},"1130":{"dur":8,"text":"we find that often a lot of the B2B content\nis dull, to put it bluntly, so it\u2019s in that"},"1138":{"dur":7,"text":"bottom left sector; whereas often you need\nto push boundaries, I think, to sound out,"},"1146":{"dur":2,"text":"you maybe need to be a bit more creative,\nof course."},"1148":{"dur":2,"text":"So, have a go at that technique."},"1150":{"dur":7,"text":"I have to say that this content marketing\nmatrix, this is an example of Smart Insights"},"1158":{"dur":1,"text":"trying to do the \u035eless is more\u035f thing."},"1159":{"dur":4,"text":"We may only produce three or four new infographics\na year, but they\u2019re very different from"},"1164":{"dur":6,"text":"the normal fare of images looking at stats\nand trends and just produced quite quickly."},"1171":{"dur":7,"text":"We might invest thousands to produce one infographic\nand then the shares we see will be reflected"},"1178":{"dur":3,"text":"in that."},"1182":{"dur":5,"text":"One of the other techniques, the formats we\ncan see, are those interactive tools."},"1187":{"dur":3,"text":"I\u2019m going to make an example of that in\na moment."},"1191":{"dur":6,"text":"The other trend I would say that we saw in\nthis HubSpot report is more people are working"},"1197":{"dur":10,"text":"on influence or outreach and paid social promotion\nas well; so, featuring your assets in LinkedIn"},"1208":{"dur":2,"text":"but also in Twitter and Facebook, potentially."},"1210":{"dur":5,"text":"I\u2019ll be asking at the end of the webinar\ntoday which of those techniques work particularly"},"1215":{"dur":2,"text":"well for you."},"1218":{"dur":7,"text":"Now, what I\u2019ve personally found is that\ninfluence or outreach doesn\u2019t work that"},"1225":{"dur":8,"text":"well unless you develop really deep relationships\nwith other individuals or, perhaps more to"},"1233":{"dur":1,"text":"the point, publishers."},"1234":{"dur":1,"text":"At\nSmart Insights \u2013 The future of digital marketing"},"1235":{"dur":3,"text":"in 2016 and beyond \u2013 transcript 5 Smart\nInsights we could spend a lot of time getting"},"1239":{"dur":6,"text":"to know Joe Pulizzi and we have done that;\nwe\u2019ve actually written on his site."},"1245":{"dur":7,"text":"But if he shared some of our content, the\nreality is it will just be a quick spike in"},"1252":{"dur":5,"text":"our social media or on our blog; we may get\n50 or 100 new visits."},"1257":{"dur":7,"text":"But so what, when we\u2019re
