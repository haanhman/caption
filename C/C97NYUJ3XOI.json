confused"},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"and think that our intentions had changed."},"597":{"dur":1,"text":"- But that was, at one time, talked about"},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"is the Evans Rule, the\nsix and a half percent"},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"unemployment rate, so there was"},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"at least a suggestion that it was a rule,"},"605":{"dur":1,"text":"then it was changed to something that"},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"some people would say was\nhopelessly sort of vague,"},"609":{"dur":4,"text":"and somewhat meaningless,\na much broader view,"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"so at least if you

no."},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"Because the rule then boxes you in"},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"to the unemployment rate, for example."},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"And there could be a lot of other

forward\nguidance be a positive step?"},"1338":{"dur":1,"text":"- Well, I think that when things"},"1340":{"dur":2,"text":"are, sort of, more smoother, more smooth"},"1342":{"dur":1,"text":"and more like historical experience,"},"1344":{"dur":2,"text":"you don't need as much,\nand so the intentions"},"1346":{"dur":2,"text":"kind of speak from historical experience,"},"1349":{"dur":2,"text":"rather than from the new words,"},"1351":{"dur":3,"text":"but when you can't rely\nas much on the past data"},"1355":{"dur":1,"text":"and you have to discount

out, and sort of the exit"},"1363":{"dur":1,"text":"will be both in terms of normalizing"},"1365":{"dur":1,"text":"interest rates, and maybe normalizing"},"1366":{"dur":1,"text":"the statement and making it shorter."},"1368":{"dur":1,"text":"- Gene Fama would it be good to get"},"1369":{"dur":1,"text":"rid of forward guidance, cause at least"},"1370":{"dur":1,"text":"then we would get rid of

worth"},"1397":{"dur":3,"text":"of excess reserves out there,\nthat could be catastrophic."},"1400":{"dur":1,"text":"So, if they're gonna do that,"},"1401":{"dur":2,"text":"they better say so in

or not,"},"1413":{"dur":2,"text":"and you know forward guidance can become"},"1416":{"dur":2,"text":"so vague that it's meaningless."},"1418":{"dur":3,"text":"And given that I don't think\nthat much
