to bed."},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"So how does the brain tell time?"},"393":{"dur":4,"text":"So to answer that question, it's\nuseful to think about timing"},"398":{"dur":1,"text":"in these different

melody."},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"But this is just to\nmake the obvious point"},"513":{"dur":5,"text":"that, without time and ability\nto perceive and tell time,"},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"music, of

in the context of\nthe lab, for example,"},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"one question we ask is\nwhatever the mechanisms"},"535":{"dur":1,"text":"within your brain that\nallow you to tell

improves,"},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"then you should be\nable to pick that up."},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"And we do."},"574":{"dur":5,"text":"And we can tell here that in\nthe 100 millisecond case, that's"},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"what you just heard,\npeople improve dramatically"},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"with practice."},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"But interestingly, if you\nhad a clock in your

that?"},"612":{"dur":5,"text":"Or what parts of the brain\nare responsible for time?"},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"Fortunately, we know exactly\nwhat part of the brain"},"620":{"dur":0,"text":"tells

time."},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"So people do still think\nabout time, even today,"},"640":{"dur":2,"text":"in the sense that you might have\na central clock in your brain."},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"So

reminds us,"},"714":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Any physical\nphenomenon may be used"},"716":{"dur":3,"text":"as a clock provided it can be\nexactly repeated as many times"},"719":{"dur":1,"text":"as

even\ncalculate the interval."},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"So the point is that\neven this static image"},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"has information about time."},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's because
