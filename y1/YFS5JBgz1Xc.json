now."},"156":{"dur":2,"text":"And the framework we use\nis in large part based"},"158":{"dur":2,"text":"on the work I did at\nMorningstar and the concept"},"161":{"dur":2,"text":"of economic moats and\nreinvesting capital"},"163":{"dur":1,"text":"at high rates of return."},"164":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's what I want\nto talk about today."},"167":{"dur":2,"text":"So the basic\nfoundation of thinking"},"170":{"dur":2,"text":"about economic moats and\ncompetitive advantage"},"172":{"dur":3,"text":"is that-- shocker--\ncapitalism works,"},"175":{"dur":4,"text":"and that capital seeks the\nhighest returns possible."},"180":{"dur":1,"text":"If a company is\nmaking a lot of money,"},"182":{"dur":2,"text":"others will seek\nto compete with it."},"184":{"dur":2,"text":"That intuitively make sense."},"187":{"dur":4,"text":"If I wrote each of you a $50\nmillion VC check and said,"},"191":{"dur":2,"text":"go start a business,\nyou would probably"},"193":{"dur":2,"text":"try to do

hope."},"200":{"dur":2,"text":"High profits attract\ncompetition, I mean,"},"203":{"dur":1,"text":"as surely as night follows day."},"204":{"dur":3,"text":"So intuitively this makes sense."},"208":{"dur":2,"text":"Empirically it\nmakes sense as well."},"210":{"dur":2,"text":"If you go back over\ntime and look at, say,"},"212":{"dur":2,"text":"take T1, companies\nin the highest"},"215":{"dur":2,"text":"decile of returns on capital."},"217":{"dur":2,"text":"Then roll the clock\nforward 10, 15 years"},"219":{"dur":2,"text":"and look at that\ncohort of companies."},"222":{"dur":2,"text":"Most will have lower\nlevels of profitability."},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"Most will have lower\nreturns on capital"},"227":{"dur":2,"text":"as their returns on\ncapital have drifted down"},"229":{"dur":4,"text":"to some mean as\ncompetition has come in."},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"Of course there is a\nminority of businesses"},"237":{"dur":1,"text":"where that's not the case."},"238":{"dur":2,"text":"So most businesses\nyou see high returns"},"240":{"dur":4,"text":"on capital decrease over\ntime as competition comes in."},"245":{"dur":3,"text":"However, there is a\nvery small minority"},"248":{"dur":2,"text":"of businesses that\nenjoy many years"},"251":{"dur":1,"text":"of high returns on capital."},"253":{"dur":1,"text":"They essentially beat the odds."},"255":{"dur":2,"text":"They defy economic gravity."},"258":{"dur":3,"text":"And the question\nsimply becomes, how?"},"261":{"dur":2,"text":"And in my view,\nit's because they've"},"263":{"dur":2,"text":"created structural\nadvantages, economic moats,"},"266":{"dur":3,"text":"a way of insulating themselves,\nbuffering themselves"},"269":{"dur":3,"text":"against the competition,\nthat enables them to maintain"},"273":{"dur":3,"text":"supernormal returns\non capital longer"},"276":{"dur":3,"text":"than academic theory and\nthe averages would suggest."},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"Because absent a\nmoat, competition"},"283":{"dur":5,"text":"destroys excess returns--\nperiod, end, full stop."},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"Any highly profitable business\nthat is easy to compete"},"291":{"dur":4,"text":"with, you will see that come\ndown over time-- very common"},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"in the fashion industry,\nvery common, say,"},"298":{"dur":2,"text":"in if you guys remember\nback in NVIDIA,"},"301":{"dur":3,"text":"and what was the other big\ngraphics company, chip company?"},"304":{"dur":0,"text":"[INAUDIBLE]?"},"305":{"dur":2,"text":"They would swap market\nshares like every six months."},"307":{"dur":0,"text":"One had the best chip."},"308":{"dur":1,"text":"Oh, now I've got the best chip."},"309":{"dur":0,"text":"Do-do-do-do."},"310":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's no moat there."},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"The moat was just, what do\nI got that's great today?"},"314":{"dur":1,"text":"And then you had a\nlot of smart engineers"},"316":{"dur":3,"text":"at the other place trying\nto make the next best thing."},"319":{"dur":2,"text":"So the basics of\nmoats is that there"},"321":{"dur":1,"text":"are structural and\nsustainable qualities that"},"323":{"dur":1,"text":"are inherent to the business."},"324":{"dur":2,"text":"A moat is part and\nparcel of the business"},"327":{"dur":0,"text":"that you're looking at."},"328":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not a hot product."},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"We all probably remember\nthe Krispy Kreme debacle."},"333":{"dur":5,"text":"They taste good, but\nsugar is not a moat."},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"Heelys-- anybody remember\nHeelys or have a kid?"},"340":{"dur":2,"text":"Remember those little shoes\nwith the wheel in the heel?"},"343":{"dur":4,"text":"That was an $800 million\ncompany at one point."},"347":{"dur":5,"text":"I mean, yes, as Dave Barry would\nsay, I am not making this up."},"352":{"dur":3,"text":"People were valuing Heelys\nas if it had a moat."},"356":{"dur":3,"text":"Aside from the massive\nproduct liability issues,"},"359":{"dur":4,"text":"once basically schools\nstarted banning them,"},"364":{"dur":3,"text":"that's a problem if your\ntarget audience of 12-year-olds"},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"can't buy your product anymore."},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"And so that business\nwent to hell pretty fast."},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not just a cool\npiece of technology."},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"We talked about in video\nand the graphics companies"},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"Remember Iomega?"},"379":{"dur":3,"text":"Remember that was\ngoing to be the thing?"},"382":{"dur":1,"text":"It's just a cool\npiece of technology."},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"And frankly, any cool\npiece of technology"},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"can be replicated by\nother smart engineers,"},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"unless there's some switch in\ncost, some lock-in effect that"},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"occurs or an industry\nstandard is created."},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"But anything that one smart\nbunch of guys can develop,"},"397":{"dur":1,"text":"there's probably\nanother smart bunch"},"399":{"dur":2,"text":"of guys somewhere else trying\nto make it even better."},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"And of course, it's not\nthe biggest market share."},"404":{"dur":2,"text":"You'll often hear companies talk\nabout, oh, we're the biggest."},"406":{"dur":1,"text":"We're going for market share."},"407":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's think about GM."},"408":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's think about Compaq."},"409":{"dur":1,"text":"It didn't work out so well."},"411":{"dur":1,"text":"Big is not a moat."},"412":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, small is often\na better moat than big."},"416":{"dur":3,"text":"Moats generally manifest\nthemselves in pricing power."},"419":{"dur":1,"text":"A company that\ncan't raise prices"},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"is unlikely to\nhave a strong moat."},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"And in fact, if you invest,\nthis is a test often"},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"that businesses are losing\ncompetitive advantage."},"429":{"dur":5,"text":"If you have a company who\ntypically raises prices 2%, 3%,"},"434":{"dur":0,"text":"4% every year."},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"They're able to kind of keep\npricing power moving up."},"437":{"dur":1,"text":"And then one year,\nsuddenly they don't."},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"They say, well,\nthe economy's tough"},"441":{"dur":3,"text":"or we want to take it easy\non the customers this year."},"444":{"dur":1,"text":"That's a load of crap."},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"It means that something has\nchanged in that industry."},"449":{"dur":1,"text":"There's a competitor out there."},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"There is some event\ngoing on that you may not"},"453":{"dur":3,"text":"be aware of that's causing them\nto lose that pricing power."},"456":{"dur":1,"text":"Because if you can\ntake price, you"},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"will take prices as a business."},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"And so companies that lose that\npricing power, that's usually"},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"the first sign that\ntheir moat is eroding."},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"So what I want to\ndo next is talk"},"467":{"dur":3,"text":"about the four kinds of moats\nthat I identified when we were"},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"at Morningstar and that I\nstill think make sense today."},"473":{"dur":3,"text":"The way we identified\nthese was by going back,"},"477":{"dur":3,"text":"this would have been about\n50 years of Compustat data,"},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"and it was pretty simple,\njust looking at businesses"},"483":{"dur":3,"text":"that had maintained returns on\ncapital above cost of capital"},"487":{"dur":1,"text":"for 15 years plus."},"488":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not a huge data set."},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"And then you\nbasically say, well,"},"491":{"dur":1,"text":"what are the common\ncharacteristics"},"493":{"dur":1,"text":"of these businesses?"},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"What are the similarities\nof these businesses?"},"496":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's where\nwe kind of teased"},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"out these four categories."},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"And they've proven to\nwork out pretty well."},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"We introduced the moat ratings\nat Morningstar in about '01."},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"And so now we've had about\n12, 13 years, and the business"},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"we initially identified as\nbeing wide-moat businesses that"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"fell into these buckets\nhave maintained higher"},"515":{"dur":1,"text":"returns on capital\nthan their peers."},"516":{"dur":5,"text":"So the empirical results\nseem to bear out the theory."},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"The first kind of\nintangible asset is a brand."},"524":{"dur":3,"text":"And a brand is valuable\nif it either increases"},"527":{"dur":3,"text":"your willingness to pay or\nlowers your search costs."},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is really important."},"531":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not just that\nit's well known."},"533":{"dur":1,"text":"Because you think\nabout, say, Sony."},"535":{"dur":1,"text":"We've all heard of Sony, right?"},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"Sony is often ranked as one\nof the 20 most valuable brands"},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"on the planet by the\nBusiness Week brand week"},"542":{"dur":2,"text":"thingy that happens every year."},"544":{"dur":2,"text":"But let me just do a\nquick survey in this room."},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"How many of you would pay 20%\nmore for a Sony DVD player?"},"553":{"dur":0,"text":"One hand?"},"554":{"dur":0,"text":"Any hands?"},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"AUDIENCE: Maybe 15 years ago."},"556":{"dur":1,"text":"PAT DORSEY: Maybe 15 years ago."},"558":{"dur":1,"text":"That's exactly it."},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"And right now you do see like\nthe Sony Bravia TVs getting"},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"a little bit of a price\npremium over others."},"565":{"dur":0,"text":"Because it's newer."},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"DVDs were newer."},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"But consumer electronics\nis fast-cycle stuff, right?"},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"What's new today\nis old next week."},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"And so the fact that\nSony is well known"},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"and we've heard a lot about\nit does not contribute one bit"},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"to its competitive advantage."},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"In fact, I would argue\nSony could probably"},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"save a heck of a lot of\nmoney by not advertising"},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"or advertising very little."},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"On Michigan Ave in\nChicago where I work,"},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"they have this super\nexpensive flagship store"},"591":{"dur":1,"text":"with all kinds of cool\nstuff you can play with."},"593":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'm sure they're paying God\nknows what in rent-- useless."},"596":{"dur":3,"text":"Because that brand doesn't\nchange your behavior."},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"By contrast, let's\nlook at Tiffany."},"602":{"dur":4,"text":"Tiffany will charge you 20%\nmore for the exact same diamond"},"606":{"dur":3,"text":"that you can buy from Blue\nNile or Zales or Helzberg"},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"or wherever you want."},"611":{"dur":3,"text":"20% is the value of\nthat pale blue box."},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"I can guarantee you the\ncardboard ain't that expensive."},"617":{"dur":0,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"OK?"},"619":{"dur":3,"text":"But you know as the\ngiver of a diamond,"},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"that you'll probably get a\nbigger smile off the recipient"},"626":{"dur":3,"text":"if it's in a Tiffany box than\nif it's not in a Tiffany box."},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"So they can charge it."},"632":{"dur":1,"text":"And so that brand\nhas value, right?"},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"That brand increases\nyour willingness to pay."},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's value there."},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"You also have brands\nthat lower search costs."},"640":{"dur":2,"text":"So think about Coca-Cola\nor Wrigley gum."},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"You don't pay a lot more\nfor Coke versus Pepsi,"},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"but you know you like\nCoke, so you go there."},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"You like Heinz, so you\ngrab it off the shelf"},"650":{"dur":1,"text":"because you don't want\nto sit there and compare"},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"ketchup prices for 20 minutes\nbefore buying the ketchup."},"655":{"dur":1,"text":"It's $3."},"656":{"dur":0,"text":"My kids like ketchup."},"657":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's go get the ketchup."},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"We go through ketchup\nin vats at my house."},"660":{"dur":1,"text":"I have twin\nseven-year-olds, and I"},"662":{"dur":1,"text":"think ketchup is like\nour fifth food group."},"664":{"dur":2,"text":"It's ridiculous."},"667":{"dur":4,"text":"So again, if a brand\nchanges consumer behavior"},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"by increasing the\nwillingness to pay"},"674":{"dur":3,"text":"or reducing the search\ncosts, then it has value."},"677":{"dur":3,"text":"Just being well known\ndoesn't mean anything at all."},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"Patents-- obviously a\npatent is a legal monopoly."},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"But they are subject to\nexpiration, challenge,"},"686":{"dur":1,"text":"and piracy."},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"And so you want to be very\ncareful of a business--"},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"you see this a lot in like\nspecialty pharmaceuticals"},"692":{"dur":3,"text":"where you have one\nasset, one drug driving"},"695":{"dur":1,"text":"all of your economic value."},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"That patent gets\nchallenged, you're dead."},"699":{"dur":3,"text":"And last time I checked, patent\nlawyers drive really nice cars."},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's a reason\nfor that, which"},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"is that patents are\nvaluable to challenge."},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"And so if they\ncan be challenged,"},"707":{"dur":1,"text":"they will be challenged."},"708":{"dur":3,"text":"So you want to rely\non patents as a moat"},"711":{"dur":1,"text":"when you have a\nportfolio of them,"},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"that it's hard to\ninvalidate one or the other."},"716":{"dur":1,"text":"Think of ARM Holdings,\nwhere there's"},"718":{"dur":1,"text":"this huge portfolio of patents."},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"And then finally,\nlicenses and approvals."},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"You have a license\nto do something"},"723":{"dur":3,"text":"that not many people\ncan do or an approval,"},"726":{"dur":1,"text":"that is a pretty\nsolid economic moat."},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"Casinos-- not easy to\nget a casino license."},"731":{"dur":1,"text":"Six of them in Macau."},"732":{"dur":0,"text":"That's it."},"733":{"dur":1,"text":"They ain't giving out any more."},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"Landfills-- no one likes\nto live near a landfill."},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"So municipalities don't give\nout tons of landfill licenses,"},"741":{"dur":1,"text":"because then nobody\nwants to live there."},"742":{"dur":1,"text":"And that reduces the tax base."},"744":{"dur":1,"text":"So once you have a\nlandfill or a gravel pit,"},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"you probably aren't going to\nget a whole lot more of them."},"748":{"dur":1,"text":"Aircraft parts are\nthe same thing,"},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"have to be FAA\ncertified, and that's"},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"a huge moat to the\naircraft parts industry."},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"Most aircraft parts\nare sole source."},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"They have one manufacturer\nwho makes them."},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"And so they get about a\n40% margin on aftermarket."},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a beautiful business."},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're selling a brand,\nif you're a company,"},"767":{"dur":1,"text":"here's what you want\nto look for when you're"},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"looking at\nbrand-based companies."},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"Brands are valuable\nif they deliver"},"772":{"dur":2,"text":"a consistent or\naspirational experience."},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, consistency lowers search\ncosts and drives loyalty."},"779":{"dur":3,"text":"So what you don't want to do\nis change the damn product."},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"That's the stupidest\nthing possible."},"784":{"dur":2,"text":"Remember New Coke?"},"787":{"dur":1,"text":"Idiotic."},"789":{"dur":4,"text":"Schlitz-- Schlitz used to be\nthe second highest selling"},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"beer in the US,\nmost volume the US."},"795":{"dur":3,"text":"Now not so much, right?"},"799":{"dur":3,"text":"And the reason was they\nchanged the way it was made."},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"They changed the\ntaste of Schlitz."},"805":{"dur":2,"text":"Why would you do this?"},"807":{"dur":1,"text":"Recently there was\nsomething like-- I"},"809":{"dur":1,"text":"think it was either Heinz\nor there was actually"},"811":{"dur":1,"text":"a ketchup that\nwas going to lower"},"812":{"dur":1,"text":"the amount of sugar content."},"813":{"dur":1,"text":"They were going to\nchange the recipe."},"815":{"dur":1,"text":"And you just go, stop."},"816":{"dur":4,"text":"If people are buying\nthis, why change it?"},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"Aspiration, by contrast,\nincreases willingness to pay."},"823":{"dur":3,"text":"So what you want to do is\ncreate scarcity and exclusivity."},"827":{"dur":3,"text":"A very interesting\nexample is Tiffany stores."},"831":{"dur":2,"text":"Tiffany is unique in that we\nthink of it as a very expensive"},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"brand, but over 40%\nof their revenue"},"837":{"dur":3,"text":"comes from stuff that's\nsells for under $200."},"840":{"dur":1,"text":"You wouldn't think about that."},"842":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's brilliant."},"843":{"dur":1,"text":"They're one of the\nonly companies that"},"844":{"dur":2,"text":"can hit volume and\nhit high price."},"847":{"dur":1,"text":"But here's how they\ndo it, one of the ways"},"849":{"dur":1,"text":"they do it by\nmaintaining the brand."},"851":{"dur":1,"text":"You would think\nthat the stuff that"},"852":{"dur":1,"text":"drives 40% of your\nsales, that would"},"853":{"dur":1,"text":"be at the front of\nthe store, right?"},"855":{"dur":1,"text":"You want people to get\neasy access to that."},"857":{"dur":1,"text":"No, no, no, no, no."},"858":{"dur":1,"text":"Go into a Tiffany store."},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"The cheap stuff is at the back."},"862":{"dur":1,"text":"So the expensive\nstuff, the stuff"},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"that costs more\nthan a Tesla, that's"},"865":{"dur":1,"text":"sitting in the\nfront of the store."},"867":{"dur":2,"text":"Because that keeps the\nvalue of the brand up."},"869":{"dur":4,"text":"That maintains an aura of\nexclusivity and scarcity."},"873":{"dur":2,"text":"And so they keep\nthe brand value up."},"876":{"dur":3,"text":"Or Patek Phillippe, very\nexpensive watch
