Before I started\nin start-ups I worked at newspapers and magazines"},"84":{"dur":6,"text":"in New York and here in Colorado, and I knew\nenough about writers and about the writing"},"90":{"dur":5,"text":"process that I thought maybe we could do crowdsourcing.\nI was also interested in crowdsourcing."},"96":{"dur":4,"text":"And so my partner Wade and I spent a lot of\ntime talking about the way a crowd might work"},"101":{"dur":5,"text":"and the way of the dynamics of writers, and\nwhat would actually work for small business,"},"106":{"dur":4,"text":"and what would make it easy for them because\nthe process of hiring a writer can be really"},"111":{"dur":4,"text":"tricky, and so how can we simplify that as\nmuch as possible.

And so"},"334":{"dur":4,"text":"they feel like, hey, if the number that's\ncome up several times, it's interesting. They"},"338":{"dur":4,"text":"say,\"These posts get me 85% of the way there\n. . .\", like several different people have"},"343":{"dur":4,"text":"used that same number with me.

They have a client that maybe sells industrial\nscales or something that is just kind of hard"},"420":{"dur":5,"text":"for their staff at the agency to write about\nweek after week. So they hire us because we've"},"425":{"dur":3,"text":"got thousands of writers and we can always\ncome up with a fresh angle. So we get them"},"429":{"dur":4,"text":"the post and then that takes them that 85%\nof the way. They take it the rest of the 15%"},"433":{"dur":4,"text":"of the way. And then they charge for that.\nRight? And so they charge a lot more than"},"437":{"dur":4,"text":"we charge for the content, but they're doing\nthe client management of those clients.

I assume"},"500":{"dur":1,"text":"they apply to be a writer, they get approved."},"501":{"dur":0,"text":"Scott: Right."},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"Brent: What's the typical return for them?\nAre they going to get work by getting into"},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"the BlogMutt system if they're a good writer?"},"507":{"dur":4,"text":"Scott: Yeah, absolutely and then we can manage\nthe system as a whole. So if we have a writer"},"512":{"dur":4,"text":"who has a lot of posts that's getting rejected,\nwe can yank that writer out. But that doesn't"},"516":{"dur":5,"text":"happen too often actually. Most of the people\nthat once they get into our system, they understand"},"521":{"dur":4,"text":"how it works, and they understand how to write\nposts that are really going to work for the"},"526":{"dur":4,"text":"business. And if they can't do those, they\njust kind of fade away. But the ones that"},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"are good and can write successful posts do\nit and we encourage them."},"533":{"dur":6,"text":"We have a very active forum.

There\nare service providers that are really high-end"},"579":{"dur":7,"text":"that we love. There's one Contently out of\nNew York. Fantastic company, but very high-end."},"586":{"dur":6,"text":"You're talking about it can be thousands of\ndollars per blog post or even many hundreds"},"593":{"dur":4,"text":"of dollars per blog posts. And some of the\nwriters are former Boston Globe Reporters."},"597":{"dur":6,"text":"They're like very high-end and they have clients\nthat reflect that. Right? They have Fortune"},"603":{"dur":5,"text":"500 clients and they do fantastic work. And\nthere's some others that play in that space"},"609":{"dur":4,"text":"and they're terrific. And sometimes we recommend\ncustomers up to that, like if they really"},"614":{"dur":6,"text":"want a much more involved editorial process,\nwe refer people up to them because they do"},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"such fantastic work."},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"And then there are a couple other competitors\nthat play kind of in the space, but it quickly"},"627":{"dur":5,"text":"goes down to competitors that are using writers\nthat are offshore. They're using writers from"},"632":{"dur":4,"text":"India and there are a lot of people who are\nvery good with the language that are from"},"636":{"dur":7,"text":"India, but writing as somebody who's in the\nUnited States is very hard to replicate.

It's hard for us because sometimes\nyou have great writers from Canada and we"},"654":{"dur":5,"text":"have to say no to them, but we've just decided\nthat as our policy you have to be in the United"},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"Brent: And you guys got written up on Tech\nCrunch."},"663":{"dur":0,"text":"Scott: Yeah."},"664":{"dur":4,"text":"Brent: You do a very interesting kind of incentive\nprogram for some of your writers. Tell us"},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"a little bit about that."},"670":{"dur":7,"text":"Scott: The genesis of it is this. A few things\nkind of came together. One is that when Huffington"},"678":{"dur":7,"text":"Post sold to AOL, big sale, lots of news and\nit was a big deal. There were some writers,"},"688":{"dur":6,"text":"a lot of writers who complained noisily about\nthe fact that this company got sold and they"},"694":{"dur":6,"text":"had been working away for HuffPo, and the\ncompany got sold, and they didn't get anything."},"701":{"dur":5,"text":"They didn't get a Christmas card from Arianna.\nThey got nothing. And I thought they weren't"},"706":{"dur":3,"text":"owed anything, but they have a point. Right?\nThey were the ones that built the value of"},"709":{"dur":4,"text":"the company and for them to not get anything\njust doesn't seem fair."},"713":{"dur":6,"text":"And so Wade and I talked about it a lot and\nfigured out a way that we could actually . . . What"},"720":{"dur":5,"text":"we created, what we call writer shares, so\nwithin BlogMutt we have a whole point system"},"725":{"dur":5,"text":"and a whole system of levels. So if you write\na post, you get a couple of points. If you"},"731":{"dur":5,"text":"sell a post, you get a bunch more points,\nand then you start out at level one and you"},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"build up. And then we have little perks for\nthe different levels that go on."},"739":{"dur":4,"text":"When you get to level five, we have a special\nLinkedIn group where you get a badge so you"},"744":{"dur":4,"text":"can put on your LinkedIn profile. Level six\nyou get a BlogMutt shirt just like this and"},"748":{"dur":4,"text":"so our writers are very happy about getting\ntheir BlogMutt shirts. And then level eight"},"753":{"dur":3,"text":"is very hard to get to. It's a lot of posts.\nIt's a lot of work. It can't be done quickly."},"756":{"dur":4,"text":"But when you get to level eight, we call it\nthe co-owner level and you get writer's shares."},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"So I don't know if I can use a prop."},"763":{"dur":4,"text":"Scott: But we just had somebody that just\ngot to their writer level today. So this is"},"768":{"dur":4,"text":"the writer stock certificate. So this is the\nwriter's shares and we print this nice certificate."},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"Wade and I still need to sign this. And we'll\nsend them this in a nice envelope, suitable"},"776":{"dur":4,"text":"for framing and we'll send them a little note\nthat says, \"Congratulations! Thanks very much"},"781":{"dur":7,"text":"for being a big part of BlogMutt.\" And then\nif we ever get acquired by who ever at whatever"},"788":{"dur":5,"text":"point down the road, they'll get a little\ncheck that will represent the fact that they"},"793":{"dur":3,"text":"were part of building the value of the company.\nAnd we've told them, look, it's not going"},"797":{"dur":4,"text":"to be enough to retire on, you're not going\nto put your kid through college, but we hope"},"801":{"dur":5,"text":"that it's meaningful and significant for you\nbecause you were so significant to us."},"806":{"dur":5,"text":"Brent: Seems like you guys really care about\nthe crowd that you've sourced your work from."},"811":{"dur":3,"text":"Scott: It's really, in a lot of ways, our\nmost valuable asset."},"815":{"dur":3,"text":"Brent: So let's switch to some conversation\naround start-ups, right."},"818":{"dur":5,"text":"Brent: So you mentioned your third start-up.\nRight? So you have a little bit of experience"},"824":{"dur":5,"text":"in this. What has made you attracted to starting\nnew businesses down this kind of product framework?"},"829":{"dur":3,"text":"That almost seems like BlogMutt's kind of\nproduct service mix."},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"Brent: Because you're providing a service\nbut it's definitely in a product framework."},"836":{"dur":5,"text":"Scott: Right. It's like, you know, they have\nsoftware as a service. I like to think of"},"841":{"dur":6,"text":"us as crowdsourcing as a service. Right? It\nis a service, it works like a software service,"},"848":{"dur":2,"text":"but there's real human beings that create\nthe posts."},"851":{"dur":7,"text":"Yeah, it's an interesting space to be in and\nit's tricky, and it's a unique thing. It's"},"858":{"dur":6,"text":"not something that's easily . . . You can't\nreplicate that kind of thing easily, but we"},"864":{"dur":3,"text":"have a lot of fun doing it. The writers are\ngreat.

And so it's just\na matter of being thoughtful about that each"},"922":{"dur":0,"text":"step of the way."},"923":{"dur":5,"text":"Brent: So managing thousands of writers, how\ndo you guys do that without indulging the"},"929":{"dur":5,"text":"secret sauce? How do you heard that many cats\nwith just a little bit of software?"},"934":{"dur":6,"text":"Scott: It's tricky. It's very tricky.
