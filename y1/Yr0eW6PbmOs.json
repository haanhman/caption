to be honest with you,"},"86":{"dur":3,"text":"we physicists\ndon't understand the dark side."},"90":{"dur":5,"text":"We don't understand\nwhat makes up 95% of our universe"},"95":{"dur":4,"text":"and this is one of the major challenges\nfacing science today"},"100":{"dur":1,"text":"because it is widely believed"},"102":{"dur":4,"text":"that if we can understand the nature\nof the dark side of our

you see, to some extent,\nmy son was right."},"117":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't always know\nwhat I am talking about."},"120":{"dur":2,"text":"But that's the beauty of science."},"122":{"dur":1,"text":"We have our theories,"},"124":{"dur":2,"text":"but we are never going to be able\nto prove our theories,"},"126":{"dur":3,"text":"so our job is to try and disprove

the dark side of the Universe."},"141":{"dur":2,"text":"There are two dark entities:"},"144":{"dur":3,"text":"dark matter and dark energy."},"148":{"dur":3,"text":"And these two dark siblings\nare currently fighting out"},"151":{"dur":2,"text":"a cosmic battle of epic proportions"},"154":{"dur":4,"text":"with the gravity of dark matter\ntrying to pull everything

time."},"187":{"dur":2,"text":"Imagine that you're looking up\nat the night sky,"},"189":{"dur":1,"text":"this whole map here spans"},"191":{"dur":3,"text":"about the size of your palm on the sky."},"195":{"dur":1,"text":"And what you can see"},"196":{"dur":4,"text":"is that the dark matter in our Universe\nlikes to clump together."},"201":{"dur":1,"text":"And we can go and look,"},"202":{"dur":3,"text":"and what we find\nis that the galaxies that we can see"},"206":{"dur":3,"text":"live inside these giant clumps\nof dark matter."},"209":{"dur":0,"text":"Indeed,"},"210":{"dur":4,"text":"there is a giant clump of dark matter\naround our own Milky Way Galaxy"},"215":{"dur":4,"text":"and all of the stars\nthat are currently swirling around."},"219":{"dur":2,"text":"If we didn't have\na giant clump of dark matter there,"},"222":{"dur":3,"text":"then those stars\nwould simply fly out into our Universe."},"226":{"dur":5,"text":"So we need dark matter to keep\nour own galaxy bound together."},"232":{"dur":3,"text":"If there is a giant clump of dark matter\nsurrounding our own galaxy,"},"236":{"dur":3,"text":"then we can conclude there must be\nsome dark matter in this room."},"240":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'm hoping that you'll indulge me\nthis afternoon"},"243":{"dur":2,"text":"in a little TEDx science experiment"},"245":{"dur":4,"text":"to see if we can catch\nan elusive particle of dark matter."},"249":{"dur":2,"text":"First of all,\nwe're going to need to construct"},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"our science experiment equipment."},"253":{"dur":4,"text":"So if you could be so kind as to put\nyour thumb and finger together"},"258":{"dur":2,"text":"to form your dark matter butterfly net."},"260":{"dur":3,"text":"Excellent! I can see\nall your dark matter butterfly nets."},"263":{"dur":1,"text":"And what we're going to do now"},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"is try and catch\nan elusive particle of dark matter"},"267":{"dur":2,"text":"and count together to five,"},"270":{"dur":4,"text":"one, two, three, four, five."},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"Keep your dark matter butterfly net up,"},"277":{"dur":3,"text":"if you managed to catch\nany dark matter particles."},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"Our theory about dark matter"},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"is that the dark matter particles\nare what we call"},"290":{"dur":4,"text":"a weakly interacting matter particle,\nor a WIMP."},"294":{"dur":3,"text":"They don't interact with the particles\nthat we are made up of,"},"298":{"dur":3,"text":"and that's why you didn't feel\nany of the dark matter particles"},"301":{"dur":3,"text":"that were flying through\nyour dark matter butterfly nets."},"304":{"dur":4,"text":"But in those five seconds,\nabout a billion dark matter particles"},"309":{"dur":4,"text":"flew through each and every one\nof your dark matter butterfly nets."},"315":{"dur":4,"text":"Indeed, in the time that it's taken\nfor you to come into this auditorium,"},"319":{"dur":3,"text":"sit down and listen to the talk so far,"},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"there's probably been one direct collision"},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"between the dark matter particle\nand a particle in your body."},"327":{"dur":1,"text":"Ouch!"},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"But you don't feel them."},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"Particle physicists are currently building"},"333":{"dur":3,"text":"giant dark matter butterfly nets\ndeep under the ground"},"337":{"dur":2,"text":"to try and catch one\nof these elusive particles."},"340":{"dur":1,"text":"And how successful they are,"},"342":{"dur":3,"text":"it just depends on how much of WIMP\nthese particles really are."},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"So, that is our theory about dark matter,"},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"but what about the evil sister dark energy"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"that is causing\nthe expansion of our universe"},"354":{"dur":3,"text":"to get faster and faster\neach and every day?"},"358":{"dur":4,"text":"In order to understand\nthe simplest theory about dark energy,"},"363":{"dur":4,"text":"we first of all we need to think\nabout the physics of nothing."},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"There are wide volumes in our universe"},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"where there is absolutely nothing,"},"375":{"dur":4,"text":"no galaxies, no gas, a complete vacuum,"},"380":{"dur":1,"text":"nothing there;"},"383":{"dur":3,"text":"apart from a swarm of virtual particles"},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"that can simply pop in\nand out of existence"},"389":{"dur":1,"text":"and in doing so,"},"391":{"dur":3,"text":"add energy into our universe\nthat fuels its accelerated expansion."},"395":{"dur":4,"text":"And if you like, you can think of this\nas a perpetual motion machine"},"399":{"dur":4,"text":"because the faster our universe expands,\nthe more vacuum is created,"},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"and the more opportunity there is"},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"for these virtual particles\nto pop into existence,"},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"thereby fueling further expansion."},"410":{"dur":4,"text":"And this beautiful, and simple,\nelegant theory has only one small problem"},"415":{"dur":3,"text":"in that you can calculate exactly\nhow much energy this would produce"},"419":{"dur":5,"text":"and it's a one\nwith 120 zeros after it bigger"},"424":{"dur":3,"text":"than the energy that we currently measure."},"428":{"dur":1,"text":"That's the problem with that theory"},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's what is leading us\nto look at other theories."},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"It could be"},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"that just as Einstein came along\nand looked at Newton's theory of gravity"},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"--with the apple falling\non his head and Einstein said:"},"441":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Hang on a minute, that's not right.\" --"},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"and came up with\nhis Theory of General Relativity,"},"445":{"dur":3,"text":"it could be that we need\nsome new bright spark"},"449":{"dur":3,"text":"to come along, thinking in abundance,"},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"and come up with a new theory of gravity"},"455":{"dur":3,"text":"that explains the Universe as a whole."},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"In the next 10 years,"},"461":{"dur":3,"text":"we're going to be launching\na new telescope into outer space,"},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"it's going to survey the whole sky"},"467":{"dur":3,"text":"and produce dark matter maps\nof the whole of our universe."},"471":{"dur":1,"text":"And with this exquisite data set"},"473":{"dur":4,"text":"we're going to be able to confront\nour theories about the dark universe."},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"I've got this feeling,\nthat by the time I'll retire,"},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll look back at this TEDx talk,"},"484":{"dur":4,"text":"and I'll think back to my son's comment\nand laugh about how right he was."},"488":{"dur":3,"text":"So I am quite sure our theories\nabout the dark universe will have changed."},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"But that's the joy\nof thinking in abundance"},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"and the beauty of science as a whole."},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you."},"499":{"dur":1,"text":"(Applause)"}}
