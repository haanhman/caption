[INAUDIBLE]"},"414":{"dur":1,"text":"say, hey, this is what we're\ntrying to get out of it."},"416":{"dur":1,"text":"But kind of go with\nit and improv it."},"417":{"dur":0,"text":"BEN DICKINSON: Yeah."},"418":{"dur":1,"text":"And the movie has a\nlot of master shots."},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a lot of scenes that\nare all one shot in the movie."},"423":{"dur":1,"text":"But for the scenes\nthat Reggie's in,"},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"I tended to do\ncoverage just so I"},"427":{"dur":3,"text":"can get when he does sort of\na stream of consciousness,"},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"I have to be able to\nloop stuff together"},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"sometimes-- [INAUDIBLE]\nin the movie."},"435":{"dur":3,"text":"And that was great because the\nmovie's so formally

you"},"450":{"dur":4,"text":"feel like you're\nreally, really engaged."},"454":{"dur":1,"text":"Because those are\ndifficult to do."},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"So what was the planning\nfor that and the decision"},"458":{"dur":0,"text":"just to do them?"},"459":{"dur":1,"text":"Was it more of a challenge\njust for yourself, like hey,"},"461":{"dur":1,"text":"Or was it just-- what was it?"},"463":{"dur":0,"text":"BEN DICKINSON: Yeah."},"464":{"dur":4,"text":"Some of it's just being lazy\nand not wanting to do coverage,"},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"seeing if I could pull it off."},"469":{"dur":5,"text":"But more importantly than that,\nin the movies, we have time,"},"475":{"dur":1,"text":"but it's not used very often."},"476":{"dur":3,"text":"Usually, the editing\nis used in a way"},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"to kind of keep you in\na trance a little bit."},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"There's always forward\nmomentum and stuff."},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"But when you shoot a scene,\nespecially of people talking,"},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"in one shot, you have the\nsense of it being more"},"492":{"dur":4,"text":"like real life, that you're\nin a suspended moment of time."},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think that\nhas a subconscious"},"499":{"dur":3,"text":"effect for an audience,\neven if they're not aware."},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"It just feels different."},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"It makes it feel a little\nbit more real in some ways,"},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"like the people are real."},"511":{"dur":0,"text":"KEVIN VLK: For sure."},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"And we were talking\nabout this upstairs,"},"514":{"dur":1,"text":"too, just about virtual\nreality and where"},"516":{"dur":3,"text":"it's going with the stuff\nwith

that."},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"And were you that much\ninto it beforehand as well,"},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"or was this just something\nyou kind of stumbled upon"},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"because it was an idea?"},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"BEN DICKINSON: Into\nVR, AR in general?"},"532":{"dur":1,"text":"BEN DICKINSON: You know what?"},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah, I didn't get into it\nuntil I needed it as a narrative"},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"device in a movie."},"539":{"dur":3,"text":"In the original draft, the\ncomponent of AR glasses"},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"was kind of like\na little flourish."},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"It was like a theme."},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"But then when I was\nwriting it-- movies kind of"},"551":{"dur":3,"text":"want to be-- as much as I\nalways think I'm making more"},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"like a European\nart house movie, I"},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"think I just loved \"Star\nWars\" when I was a kid,"},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"and I always have\nthis attraction"},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"towards-- even if I'm trying\nto deconstruct narrative,"},"565":{"dur":4,"text":"it always seems to just kind of\nlean in the direction of

movie."},"578":{"dur":5,"text":"And in order to do that, I\njust needed this through line."},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"And so then the\nglasses became really"},"586":{"dur":3,"text":"the plot in a way I didn't\nexpect just by writing it."},"589":{"dur":0,"text":"KEVIN VLK: Right."},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"And Reggie, what was\nyour experience with VR,"},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"because you're really into it."},"594":{"dur":0,"text":"REGGIE WATTS: Yeah."},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm very \"Inuit.\""},"598":{"dur":0,"text":"Yeah."},"599":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, ever since\nI was a little kid,"},"601":{"dur":4,"text":"I was into the idea of being\nable to immerse yourself"},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"in a reality convincingly and\nfeel like you're actually there"},"608":{"dur":8,"text":"and experience some other\nform of living without moving"},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"anywhere, or just\nputting on something"},"619":{"dur":1,"text":"and suddenly you're there."},"621":{"dur":3,"text":"And then when Lawnmower Man\ncame out and all of that stuff,"},"625":{"dur":1,"text":"like the promise of\nlike, yeah, we'll"},"626":{"dur":3,"text":"be in these weird

functioning"},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"the way our eyes work\nin the real world."},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"Once they fixed that,\nall of a sudden,"},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"something promising\nstarted to

the beginning."},"670":{"dur":5,"text":"So VR and AR, which essentially\nis just an evolution of VR,"},"675":{"dur":4,"text":"is very exciting to me\nbecause it hopefully"},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"can

kind of someone\ngot it and then"},"2139":{"dur":3,"text":"also added a little bit of\ntheir own thing, and I loved it."},"2142":{"dur":2,"text":"And then that freed me\nup to do more creatively."},"2145":{"dur":2,"text":"And so expanding\nthat-- the early times,"},"2148":{"dur":3,"text":"like making films, early\ninternet video times,"},"2151":{"dur":1,"text":"I was definitely\ndoing that myself"},"2152":{"dur":1,"text":"and experimenting with editing."},"2154":{"dur":2,"text":"And I just got bored of editing."},"2156":{"dur":2,"text":"It was a lot of hard\nwork,
