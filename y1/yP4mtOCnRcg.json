statements"},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"that clearly articulate how\nyou're going to weigh things."},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"Some organizations\nare much more,"},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"let's say, security

other agencies have other\nmissions and other priorities."},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"One of the things that we just\nasked every federal agency"},"507":{"dur":4,"text":"to do is look at its\nhigh value assets."},"512":{"dur":4,"text":"And this was an exercise where\nthe whole executive team--"},"516":{"dur":3,"text":"the agency secretary,\nthe deputy secretaries,"},"519":{"dur":4,"text":"the CIO-- were asked to,\nlet's look at our mission,"},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"let's look at our\nhigh-value assets,"},"526":{"dur":3,"text":"and then let's do an assessment\nof the technology and also"},"530":{"dur":4,"text":"the security that\nenable that mission."},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"And that discussion\namong the executive team"},"537":{"dur":3,"text":"is one that needs to\nhappen in every agency,"},"541":{"dur":3,"text":"every organization,\nevery private company"},"544":{"dur":2,"text":"on a regular basis--\nfirst of all,"},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"because things change\nover time sometimes,"},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"and secondly,\ntechnology evolves."},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"And so what might\nhave been appropriate"},"555":{"dur":4,"text":"two years ago or five years ago\nmight be very different today."},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"And that discussion\namong the management team"},"562":{"dur":4,"text":"is one of the best conversations\nthat should take place"},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"if it can take place."},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"The analogy that I\nthink of, quite frankly,"},"572":{"dur":6,"text":"is go back in time before\nbanks were well established."},"578":{"dur":4,"text":"And banks got robbed,\nand people didn't"},"582":{"dur":3,"text":"feel that secure, maybe, about\nputting their money in a bank."},"585":{"dur":4,"text":"And you felt, hey, if I\nhave control of it-- maybe"},"590":{"dur":4,"text":"it's under my mattress-- I'm\nfeeling secure about that."},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"But then a whole bunch\nof things changed."},"599":{"dur":4,"text":"Bank insurance came\nalong, better security,"},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"better guarantees--\nall kinds of things"},"606":{"dur":3,"text":"happened to change\npeople's mind about where"},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"they should put their money."},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think everybody\nwould recognize today"},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"that you're far\nbetter off storing"},"616":{"dur":4,"text":"your money in a bank that's\nFederal Deposit insured and so"},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"on than it would be to\nkeep it under your mattress"},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"at home, because\nnobody at home can"},"627":{"dur":5,"text":"do as good a job of security as\na big bank can, quite frankly."},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"And I see the big\ncloud providers"},"635":{"dur":2,"text":"in the same way I see a bank."},"638":{"dur":1,"text":"They have the incentive."},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"They have the skills\nand abilities,"},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"and they have the\nmotivation to do"},"645":{"dur":4,"text":"a much better job of security\nthan any one company or any one"},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"organization can probably do."},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"So while we have FedRAMP\nand FISMA and a bunch"},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"of other federal\nstandards-- and we'll"},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"continue to evolve\nand work on those--"},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"I think today the better\nbet is get to the cloud"},"664":{"dur":1,"text":"as quickly as you\ncan, because you're"},"666":{"dur":3,"text":"guaranteed almost to have\nbetter security there"},"670":{"dur":3,"text":"than you will in any private\nthing that you can do."},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's not to\ncriticize private efforts,"},"676":{"dur":3,"text":"but it's just a matter of\nscale, motivation, and risk"},"680":{"dur":3,"text":"that I think is tipping\npretty quickly in favor"},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"of cloud providers."},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"The role today, I\nthink, is one of you"},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"have to be a part of\nthe management team"},"692":{"dur":3,"text":"and be a contributor on a\nnumber of different fronts."},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not good enough\njust to be somebody"},"698":{"dur":4,"text":"who's smart about how to\ndevelop, install systems"},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"or manage the applications."},"705":{"dur":3,"text":"The reality is technology\nis so deeply embedded"},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"in every business\nventure today--"},"711":{"dur":3,"text":"it doesn't matter\nwhat it is-- most"},"714":{"dur":3,"text":"things you can't do without\nsome heavy dose of technology."},"718":{"dur":4,"text":"This is a case where I think CIO\nis both educator, consultant,"},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"business partner, but also\nvery much a collaborator"},"726":{"dur":5,"text":"with the business side of\nwhatever the enterprise is."},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think the role\nis evolving also"},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"to be one of a\ndeveloper of talent."},"737":{"dur":5,"text":"So if you have a really\ntalented CIO team,"},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"they're people who come in\nand out of various parts"},"745":{"dur":1,"text":"of the business."},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"They understand what it's\nlike to sit in the chair"},"749":{"dur":5,"text":"and make the kinds of decisions\nthat are important to be made."},"755":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think that's one of the\nreally big changes that's going"},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"on in the CIO seats these days."},"762":{"dur":4,"text":"Probably the biggest top of mind\ntechnologies for me right now"},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"and things I'm\nmost excited about"},"768":{"dur":4,"text":"are, first of all, just\nthe internet of things."},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"The ability to\ninstrument and to have"},"775":{"dur":4,"text":"data coming from all kinds\nof different places, I think,"},"779":{"dur":3,"text":"is probably the\nbiggest single thing"},"783":{"dur":3,"text":"that's going to impact our lives\nin the next 10 or 15 years."},"787":{"dur":3,"text":"So I love that I can control\nmy thermostat and a whole bunch"},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"of other things without\nhaving to physically be"},"793":{"dur":4,"text":"there, but also get information\nfrom a whole wide variety"},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"of sources that just\nweren't available before."},"800":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think this\nis going to create"},"802":{"dur":3,"text":"huge gains in our\neconomy, but also"},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"in our ability to have\nmuch better quality of life"},"808":{"dur":1,"text":"across the board."},"809":{"dur":3,"text":"Let me say as I\nwrap this up today"},"813":{"dur":1,"text":"a couple a big thank
