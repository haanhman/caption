story."},"93":{"dur":5,"text":"And what really intrigued\nme right off the bat was,"},"99":{"dur":5,"text":"how was it that a group\nof very experienced hikers"},"104":{"dur":5,"text":"left a perfectly good tent\nand walked a mile away"},"109":{"dur":3,"text":"from the tent, not\nsufficiently clothed,"},"112":{"dur":3,"text":"without the proper\nfootwear, and walked"},"116":{"dur":2,"text":"to, basically, certain death?"},"118":{"dur":3,"text":"So that central question is\nreally what pulled me in."},"122":{"dur":3,"text":"And then as a\ndocumentary filmmaker,"},"126":{"dur":2,"text":"I thought, what\nabout the hikers?"},"128":{"dur":1,"text":"We're talking nine hikers here."},"130":{"dur":2,"text":"Originally there was 10."},"132":{"dur":0,"text":"Who were they?"},"133":{"dur":1,"text":"What's their story?"},"135":{"dur":4,"text":"So I also wanted to get\ntheir story as well."},"139":{"dur":0,"text":"MAX MEDNIK:

EICHAR: Well, I\nshould go back and explain"},"151":{"dur":5,"text":"the story really quick,\njust in quick story beats."},"156":{"dur":3,"text":"In January of 1959, the\nheight of the Cold War,"},"159":{"dur":1,"text":"there was a group of\nhikers that set out."},"161":{"dur":2,"text":"Most of them were\nuniversity students,"},"163":{"dur":2,"text":"and they were setting out for an\nexpedition in the northern Ural"},"166":{"dur":1,"text":"Mountains."},"168":{"dur":2,"text":"Midway through the trip,\nthere was one hiker"},"170":{"dur":2,"text":"named Yuri Yudin who turned\nback due to an illness,"},"173":{"dur":2,"text":"never knowing he wouldn't\nsee his friends again."},"175":{"dur":5,"text":"So two weeks later, the\nhikers never return."},"181":{"dur":2,"text":"So they send out a rescue\nteam and a search team"},"184":{"dur":2,"text":"to investigate\ntheir disappearance,"},"186":{"dur":3,"text":"and they find the\ntent at the campsite,"},"190":{"dur":2,"text":"but the tent is intact."},"192":{"dur":3,"text":"All their clothing, all their\nboots, everything inside,"},"196":{"dur":3,"text":"there's even food sitting\nthere that was uneaten,"},"199":{"dur":2,"text":"is still intact,\nbut there's a hole"},"202":{"dur":3,"text":"from the inside leading out."},"205":{"dur":3,"text":"And they later found the hikers\nscattered over a mile away"},"208":{"dur":1,"text":"from the tent."},"210":{"dur":2,"text":"All of them were\ninsufficiently clothed"},"213":{"dur":2,"text":"for subzero temperatures."},"216":{"dur":2,"text":"The majority of them didn't\nhave on the proper shoes."},"218":{"dur":2,"text":"Some had violent injuries."},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"One was missing a tongue."},"223":{"dur":6,"text":"So again, what baffled me is\nhow could it be over 50 years"},"229":{"dur":5,"text":"and nobody understands or\nhas figured out the events"},"234":{"dur":1,"text":"leading to their deaths."},"236":{"dur":2,"text":"So I started\nresearching everything"},"239":{"dur":2,"text":"I possibly could here."},"241":{"dur":1,"text":"Googled like crazy."},"243":{"dur":2,"text":"And I only came up with a\ncertain amount of information"},"246":{"dur":2,"text":"that I didn't feel was\nsufficient, so I thought,"},"248":{"dur":4,"text":"how can I further this story,\nfurther my investigation?"},"252":{"dur":3,"text":"So I found a man by the\nname of Yury Kuntsevich"},"256":{"dur":3,"text":"in Russia who's the head\nof the Dyatlov Foundation."},"259":{"dur":1,"text":"Called him with the\ntranslator, and he"},"261":{"dur":4,"text":"didn't me from anybody else, and\nwe talked for like 20 minutes."},"265":{"dur":4,"text":"And he really didn't\ngive me much information,"},"270":{"dur":2,"text":"but in the end he\nsaid, if you really"},"272":{"dur":4,"text":"want to know more about\nthis story, come to Russia."},"277":{"dur":2,"text":"So I hung up the phone."},"279":{"dur":1,"text":"I thought, oh shit."},"281":{"dur":2,"text":"He just basically-- it\nwas almost like a summons,"},"284":{"dur":3,"text":"So I talked to my girlfriend,\nwho was seven months pregnant"},"288":{"dur":3,"text":"at the time, which isn't the\nbest time to go to Russia."},"291":{"dur":3,"text":"And she said, you got to go."},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"So basically, I had two\npeople saying I have to go,"},"297":{"dur":2,"text":"so I actually had to go."},"299":{"dur":2,"text":"And I jumped on a\nplane, and I had"},"301":{"dur":4,"text":"no idea what I\nwas stepping into."},"306":{"dur":4,"text":"When I got there,\nto Yekaterinburg,"},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"I lived with Yury\nKuntsevich and his family"},"314":{"dur":3,"text":"and ended up uncovering a\ntrove of materials, the hikers'"},"317":{"dur":5,"text":"journals, the hikers' recovered\nphotos, the criminal case,"},"322":{"dur":3,"text":"which the attention to detail\nback then was extraordinary."},"326":{"dur":4,"text":"And I also started to get\nintroduced to the friends"},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"and family of the hikers\nand the search teams"},"332":{"dur":3,"text":"and started to interview them."},"336":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's when the\nstory began to feel real."},"339":{"dur":2,"text":"It was no longer a myth\nor a rumor or this thing"},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"that I didn't understand, and\nit started to become real to me"},"345":{"dur":0,"text":"at that point."},"346":{"dur":0,"text":"MAX MEDNIK: Nice."},"347":{"dur":1,"text":"What was it like\nactually interviewing"},"348":{"dur":1,"text":"some of the family\nmembers of the hikers?"},"352":{"dur":1,"text":"DONNIE EICHAR: It was\na great experience"},"354":{"dur":3,"text":"because that's when\nI knew I had a story."},"357":{"dur":3,"text":"And I started learning about\nthe hikers that-- you know,"},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"it was the height of the\nCold War, but some of them"},"363":{"dur":1,"text":"were poets."},"365":{"dur":1,"text":"Some of them were musicians."},"367":{"dur":3,"text":"And they were these\ngentlemen adventurers,"},"371":{"dur":1,"text":"and there was this\nsense of innocence"},"372":{"dur":3,"text":"that existed that I don't\nthink exists anymore today."},"375":{"dur":1,"text":"And they would go\noff into the woods"},"377":{"dur":3,"text":"for pure escapism\nand sometimes just"},"381":{"dur":3,"text":"to recite forbidden poetry,\nif you can imagine that,"},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"or just to play songs\nthat are forbidden."},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"They would memorize\nhundreds of songs."},"389":{"dur":3,"text":"So this great story\nstarted to materialize,"},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"and I became as\ninterested in the hikers"},"394":{"dur":3,"text":"as I was the actual\ntragedy itself."},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"But as I was interviewing\nthe search and rescue teams,"},"400":{"dur":3,"text":"I was also putting\ntogether the story"},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"of the investigation\nand all the details"},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"that followed with that."},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"MAX MEDNIK: Wow."},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"Tell us about the hikers."},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"Did they actually have\nsufficient experience"},"417":{"dur":3,"text":"and skills to actually\ngo on such a trip?"},"420":{"dur":3,"text":"DONNIE EICHAR: The hikers\nwere very experienced, highly"},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"educated."},"426":{"dur":3,"text":"Most were engineers."},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"These weren't\nuniversity students"},"432":{"dur":3,"text":"going out, getting\ndrunk, partying."},"435":{"dur":3,"text":"They were doing it for all the\nright reasons in my opinion,"},"439":{"dur":7,"text":"and they were actually working\ntowards a class 3 hiking"},"447":{"dur":3,"text":"license, which is the\nequivalent of a master of sport,"},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"and they were at level 2."},"453":{"dur":4,"text":"So they would have to cover\na certain amount of area"},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"and do a certain\namount of things"},"459":{"dur":1,"text":"in order to get this\nlevel 3, and that"},"461":{"dur":3,"text":"was what their final expedition\nwas into the northern Ural"},"464":{"dur":4,"text":"And they specifically\nwould challenge themselves"},"469":{"dur":3,"text":"and put themselves in\ndangerous situations"},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"and extreme situations\nin subzero temperatures"},"475":{"dur":4,"text":"in remote areas simply for the\ntask of challenging oneself."},"479":{"dur":4,"text":"And they would also\nchart uncharted areas"},"484":{"dur":1,"text":"for Google Maps\nand all that stuff."},"485":{"dur":1,"text":"So they would go out\nthere and actually collect"},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"data for their university\nand come back and give it"},"490":{"dur":3,"text":"to them simply to\nchart the area."},"494":{"dur":3,"text":"So I found that really\ncompelling as well,"},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"just the innocence of it,\nand just the camaraderie."},"500":{"dur":6,"text":"And as I said, they were kind\nof like these Jack London type"},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"characters, and they\nwere very respectful."},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"And you know, there was love\ninterest within the group,"},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"but they were gentlemen,\nand there was two girls."},"516":{"dur":3,"text":"They would never show\nthat love interest"},"520":{"dur":3,"text":"because the goal was\nto conquer the distance"},"523":{"dur":4,"text":"and not let any other\npersonal stuff get in the way."},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"So I just, I really admire that."},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"I thought that's pretty great."},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"MAX MEDNIK: Why do you\nthink that Yuri Yudin, who"},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"was the only survivor, who\nhadn't spoken for so long,"},"536":{"dur":4,"text":"would talk to you, who was an\nAmerican from who knows where?"},"540":{"dur":0,"text":"DONNIE EICHAR: Yeah."},"541":{"dur":0,"text":"Yuri Yudin."},"542":{"dur":2,"text":"Wow."},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"Yuri Yudin was the\nonly surviving hiker,"},"546":{"dur":4,"text":"that turned back halfway,\nnever saw his friends again."},"551":{"dur":4,"text":"He had alluded, journalists and\nreporters for over 50 years,"},"556":{"dur":6,"text":"and I had always wondered,\ndoes he have survivor's guilt?"},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"But I knew he held the\nanswers to the stories"},"565":{"dur":3,"text":"in between the hikers'\njournals and all the photos,"},"568":{"dur":3,"text":"and he's the only one that\ncould tell that story."},"572":{"dur":3,"text":"So ignorantly, I thought\nsomehow I could find him."},"576":{"dur":3,"text":"And after two years, I thought,\nI'm not going to find him."},"579":{"dur":4,"text":"But on my second trip there,\nI found out that he was there."},"583":{"dur":3,"text":"And big moment for\nme, and I'm going in,"},"587":{"dur":4,"text":"and I finally sit down to\ndo an interview with him,"},"591":{"dur":1,"text":"and the translator's late."},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"So we just sat there and\nhad tea for 40 minutes"},"596":{"dur":3,"text":"and stared at each other, and\nI couldn't talk to the man."},"599":{"dur":3,"text":"And finally, the\ntranslator shows up,"},"603":{"dur":3,"text":"and the first\nquestion he says is,"},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"don't you have mysteries\nin your own country?"},"609":{"dur":1,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"DONNIE EICHAR: So I'd\ncome all this way,"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"and he hits me\nwith that question,"},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"and totally not\nprepared for that."},"617":{"dur":1,"text":"And he had a good point."},"619":{"dur":1,"text":"Of course, we've\ngot mysteries here."},"620":{"dur":1,"text":"Why do I care?"},"622":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not Russian."},"623":{"dur":4,"text":"But he told me to turn off\nmy Cold War tape recorder,"},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"so I turned that\noff, and then he"},"630":{"dur":3,"text":"proceeded to interview\nme for a good 40 minutes"},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"before I could interview him."},"637":{"dur":4,"text":"But once that trust\nwas established,"},"641":{"dur":4,"text":"he opened up over two weeks\nand told me his personal story,"},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"his background, his childhood."},"648":{"dur":3,"text":"And told me this story\nabout these hikers"},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"and these expeditions\nthat they would do,"},"654":{"dur":5,"text":"and it was sort of like\nthis sort of cold weather,"},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"motorcycle diaries\nstyle adventures"},"662":{"dur":0,"text":"that they would have."},"663":{"dur":3,"text":"And in this final\nexpedition, they"},"666":{"dur":4,"text":"stopped at his school to\ntell stories and sing music."},"670":{"dur":3,"text":"And they stopped at a\nwood-cutting settlement"},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"and stayed up all night,\nnot partying and drinking,"},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"but playing music\nand reciting poetry."},"679":{"dur":1,"text":"And to me, I was just shocked."},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"I had no idea that was going on."},"683":{"dur":3,"text":"So he was such an\nimportant part of the book,"},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"to be able to fill all that in."},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was really endearing."},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"Every night he would say\nto me, I'm praying for you."},"695":{"dur":3,"text":"And he was praying\nfor me because he"},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"was worried about me\ngoing on this expedition."},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was very endearing,\nbut it was also scary as hell."},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"And I would lay down\nat night, because I"},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"would think, why is\nthis guy praying for me?"},"708":{"dur":1,"text":"Is it really that dangerous?"},"709":{"dur":1,"text":"I know it's remote, but."},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"It was an honor for\nme to interview him"},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"and that he gave me his\nstory of all people."},"719":{"dur":3,"text":"And unfortunately,\nended up dying shortly"},"723":{"dur":1,"text":"after I interviewed him."},"724":{"dur":7,"text":"So I consider that a\nsmall piece of history"},"732":{"dur":4,"text":"that, for some reason,\nhe told me about."},"736":{"dur":4,"text":"MAX MEDNIK: How do you think\nyou were able to get his trust?"},"741":{"dur":1,"text":"DONNIE EICHAR: I don't know."},"742":{"dur":4,"text":"I think part of it was,\njust crazy American, went"},"746":{"dur":5,"text":"all that way to go over\nthere and to give it a shot"},"751":{"dur":1,"text":"and to try to get him to talk."},"753":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think maybe, too,\nit was I wasn't as focused"},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"about the tragedy\nas I just wanted"},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"to know about his\nfriends and who"},"763":{"dur":4,"text":"they were as people,\nnot Russians,"},"767":{"dur":3,"text":"not-- it doesn't matter the\nCold War, just who were they"},"770":{"dur":0,"text":"as people?"},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"Tell me stories\nabout them because I"},"773":{"dur":4,"text":"wanted to be able to develop\na relationship with them,"},"777":{"dur":1,"text":"as well as the readers\nto be able to develop"},"779":{"dur":1,"text":"a relationship with\nthem, because you have"},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"to care about them\nin order to want"},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"to be a part of this story."},"786":{"dur":1,"text":"MAX MEDNIK: What\nwas it like actually"},"787":{"dur":3,"text":"retracing the hikers' journey?"},"791":{"dur":2,"text":"DONNIE EICHAR: Well, I\ngot to a certain point"},"793":{"dur":6,"text":"where I figured out if I'm\ntruly going to tell this story,"},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"I have to literally\nand figuratively walk"},"802":{"dur":3,"text":"in their footsteps,\nso I decided I'm"},"805":{"dur":4,"text":"going to retrace their\nfootsteps the best I could."},"810":{"dur":5,"text":"And it was a surreal\nexperience because years ago I"},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"grew up in Florida-- I've\nbeen in Southern California 17"},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"years-- I would never\nimagine I would be there"},"820":{"dur":5,"text":"at the gateway of Siberia in\n25 below zero, and for what?"},"826":{"dur":2,"text":"I didn't really\nknow at that point."},"829":{"dur":3,"text":"But to be able to go to those\nplaces, to go to the school,"},"833":{"dur":2,"text":"and to go to Ivdel, where all\nthe gulags were that they wrote"},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"about in their\ndiaries, and to go"},"838":{"dur":4,"text":"to Ushma, which is a\nMansi village where"},"842":{"dur":1,"text":"the indigenous people live."},"843":{"dur":1,"text":"They were right near there."},"845":{"dur":3,"text":"And to basically\ngo from their dorm"},"848":{"dur":4,"text":"to the place on the mountain top\nwhere they had set their tent,"},"852":{"dur":1,"text":"for me, personally,\nwas extraordinary."},"854":{"dur":3,"text":"And one big thing\nthat I realized,"},"858":{"dur":3,"text":"you could see in the\ntrailer, is to walk"},"861":{"dur":5,"text":"a mile is extremely difficult\nin daylight with the best gear"},"866":{"dur":4,"text":"I could possibly buy to be\nwarm because the terrain"},"870":{"dur":2,"text":"there, it goes from\na few inches of snow"},"873":{"dur":4,"text":"to this much snow\nin a footstep, so"},"878":{"dur":2,"text":"it's very, very hard to walk."},"880":{"dur":4,"text":"And to think that these hikers\nleft their tent at night,"},"884":{"dur":4,"text":"insufficiently clothed\nwithout footwear,"},"888":{"dur":3,"text":"and walked a mile,\nthat's when I thought,"},"891":{"dur":1,"text":"wow, this had to\nhave been something"},"893":{"dur":2,"text":"that they thought it was\nsafer to leave the tent"},"896":{"dur":1,"text":"than to stay in the tent."},"897":{"dur":2,"text":"But to also just stand there\nand look down into the cedars"},"900":{"dur":0,"text":"where they died."},"901":{"dur":5,"text":"And it was an extraordinary\nexperience for me,"},"906":{"dur":5,"text":"and hopefully that's what\nI've portrayed in the book."},"911":{"dur":0,"text":"MAX MEDNIK: Nice."},"912":{"dur":4,"text":"Did you have some people\nlocally help you or escort you"},"916":{"dur":1,"text":"during any of the hiking?"},"917":{"dur":2,"text":"I had Yury Kuntsevich, who\nis the head of the Dyatlov"},"920":{"dur":4,"text":"Foundation, and two other\npeople that came along,"},"925":{"dur":2,"text":"Vladimir [? Borsnakov,\n?] who is a scientist."},"927":{"dur":2,"text":"All the people were a little\nbit in their golden years,"},"930":{"dur":3,"text":"so that was kind of interesting\ngoing with those guys."},"934":{"dur":3,"text":"And Yuri Yudin\ndidn't come along,"},"937":{"dur":3,"text":"which, again, kind\nof worried me a bit."},"941":{"dur":3,"text":"But he just said,\nfarewell, and had"},"945":{"dur":4,"text":"that look like, I may\nnot see you again."},"949":{"dur":3,"text":"But you know, it was\na great experience."},"953":{"dur":2,"text":"My first trip to\nRussia, they made me"},"955":{"dur":2,"text":"an honorary Boy\nScout before I left."},"957":{"dur":3,"text":"And it may not sound like a\nbig thing here-- I wasn't a Boy"},"961":{"dur":5,"text":"Scout-- but I was in tears\nbecause they gave me a pin"},"966":{"dur":4,"text":"and taught me the handshake,\nand it was a real honor."},"971":{"dur":3,"text":"So that was a continuation,\nwhen I did the expedition,"},"974":{"dur":3,"text":"of the camaraderie."},"977":{"dur":2,"text":"And I put my life\nin their hands,"},"980":{"dur":2,"text":"and I had a one-year-old at\nhome on that second expedition."},"982":{"dur":5,"text":"So I, by no means, climbed\nto the top of Mount Everest,"},"988":{"dur":2,"text":"but where I went\nwas very remote,"},"991":{"dur":2,"text":"and if something happens\nthere, I'm 30 hours away"},"993":{"dur":1,"text":"from the nearest\nthird-world hospital."},"995":{"dur":7,"text":"So I put my trust in their hands\nand in your fellow human being,"},"1002":{"dur":2,"text":"and it was a great experience."},"1004":{"dur":4,"text":"My translator on the trip wasn't\nthat great, so a lot of times"},"1008":{"dur":3,"text":"I didn't really know what\nthe hell was going on."},"1011":{"dur":3,"text":"And I had my camera,\nmy video camera,"},"1015":{"dur":1,"text":"and I would flip the\nscreen backwards."},"1017":{"dur":3,"text":"And it sounds maybe a bit weird,\nbut through the experience"},"1021":{"dur":1,"text":"I would just talk\ninto the screen"},"1022":{"dur":3,"text":"and just see myself, but just\nhave someone to connect with."},"1026":{"dur":2,"text":"And I later showed\nit to my girlfriend,"},"1028":{"dur":1,"text":"and she's just\nlike, wow, I don't"},"1030":{"dur":1,"text":"know if I would show\nsome of this stuff"},"1031":{"dur":1,"text":"to people because\nit looks like you're"},"1033":{"dur":1,"text":"losing your mind,\ntalking to yourself."},"1035":{"dur":1,"text":"But you know, I just\nneeded a connection"},"1036":{"dur":3,"text":"to talk as I'm going\nthrough all this"},"1040":{"dur":2,"text":"because a lot of times I\ncouldn't really talk to people."},"1042":{"dur":2,"text":"So it was cool."},"1045":{"dur":1,"text":"MAX MEDNIK: That\nsounds super intense."},"1046":{"dur":2,"text":"It sounds like through a lot of\nthe interviews and your travel"},"1049":{"dur":3,"text":"you got a pretty deep sense\nfor just Russian culture"},"1053":{"dur":3,"text":"and a lot of interesting\nparts of Russian history"},"1056":{"dur":1,"text":"because you talked to\na lot of people
