more\nbefore we talked about these data."},"202":{"dur":3,"text":"But actually, it turns out\nthere's a twist here,"},"206":{"dur":3,"text":"because givers are often\nsacrificing

takes"},"241":{"dur":3,"text":"to build cultures where givers\nactually get to succeed."},"245":{"dur":3,"text":"So I wondered, then, if givers\nare the worst performers,"},"248":{"dur":1,"text":"who are the best performers?"},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"Let me start with the good news:\nit's not the takers."},"254":{"dur":3,"text":"Takers tend to rise quickly\nbut also fall quickly in most

so when you meet a taker,"},"264":{"dur":1,"text":"you feel like it's your mission in life"},"266":{"dur":2,"text":"to just punish the hell\nout of that

if you're a taker,"},"275":{"dur":1,"text":"it tends to catch up with you eventually;"},"277":{"dur":1,"text":"what goes around will come around."},"279":{"dur":1,"text":"And so the logical conclusion is:"},"281":{"dur":2,"text":"it must be the matchers\nwho are the best performers."},"283":{"dur":1,"text":"But they're not."},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"In every job, in every organization\nI've ever studied,"},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"the best results belong\nto the givers again."},"291":{"dur":3,"text":"Take a look at some data I gathered\nfrom hundreds of salespeople,"},"294":{"dur":1,"text":"tracking their revenue."},"296":{"dur":2,"text":"What you can see is that the givers\ngo to both extremes."},"298":{"dur":3,"text":"They make up the majority of people\nwho bring in the lowest revenue,"},"301":{"dur":1,"text":"but also the highest revenue."},"303":{"dur":2,"text":"The same patterns were true\nfor engineers'

that I can track."},"312":{"dur":1,"text":"Which raises the question:"},"313":{"dur":3,"text":"How do we create a world\nwhere more of these givers get to excel?"},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"I want to talk about how to do that,\nnot just in businesses,"},"319":{"dur":1,"text":"but also in nonprofits, schools --"},"321":{"dur":1,"text":"even governments."},"322":{"dur":1,"text":"Are you

thing that's really critical"},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"is to recognize that givers\nare your most valuable people,"},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"but if they're not careful, they burn out."},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"So you have to protect\nthe givers in your midst."},"339":{"dur":4,"text":"And I learned a great lesson about this\nfrom Fortune's best

second thing that matters"},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"if you want to build a culture\nwhere givers succeed,"},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"is you actually need a culture\nwhere help-seeking is the norm;"},"394":{"dur":1,"text":"where people ask a lot."},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"This may hit a little too close\nto home for some of you."},"399":{"dur":3,"text":"[So in all your relationships,\nyou always have to be the giver?]"},"402":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"What you see with successful givers"},"405":{"dur":3,"text":"is they recognize that it's OK\nto be a receiver, too."},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"If you run an organization,\nwe can actually make this easier."},"411":{"dur":2,"text":"We can make it easier\nfor people to ask for help."},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"A couple colleagues and I\nstudied hospitals."},"416":{"dur":3,"text":"We found that on certain floors,\nnurses did a lot of help-seeking,"},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"and on other floors,\nthey did very little of it."},"421":{"dur":3,"text":"The factor that stood out on the floors\nwhere help-seeking was common,"},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"where it was the norm,"},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"was there was just one nurse\nwhose sole job it was"},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"to help other nurses on the unit."},"430":{"dur":1,"text":"When that role was

encouraged.\""},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"Help-seeking isn't important\njust for protecting the success"},"441":{"dur":1,"text":"and the well-being of givers."},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"It's also critical to getting\nmore people to act like givers,"},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"because the data say"},"446":{"dur":3,"text":"that somewhere between 75 and 90 percent\nof all giving in organizations"},"450":{"dur":1,"text":"starts with a request."},"451":{"dur":1,"text":"But a lot of people don't ask."},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"They don't want to look incompetent,"},"455":{"dur":3,"text":"they don't know where to turn,\nthey don't want to burden others."},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"Yet if nobody ever asks for help,"},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"you have a lot of frustrated givers\nin your organization"},"462":{"dur":1,"text":"who would love to step up and contribute,"},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"if they only knew\nwho could benefit and how."},"467":{"dur":1,"text":"But I think the most important thing,"},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"if you want to build a culture\nof successful givers,"},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"is to be thoughtful about who\nyou let onto your team."},"474":{"dur":3,"text":"I figured, you want a culture\nof productive generosity,"},"477":{"dur":1,"text":"you should hire a bunch of givers."},"479":{"dur":3,"text":"But I was surprised to discover, actually,\nthat that was not right --"},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"that the negative impact\nof a taker on a culture"},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"is usually double to triple\nthe positive impact of a giver."},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"Think about it this way:"},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"one bad apple can spoil a barrel,"},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"but one good egg\njust does not make a dozen."},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't know what that means --"},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"But I hope you do."},"500":{"dur":3,"text":"No -- let even one taker into a team,"},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"and you will see that the givers\nwill stop helping."},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"They'll say, \"I'm surrounded\nby a bunch of snakes and sharks."},"509":{"dur":1,"text":"Why should I contribute?\""},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"Whereas if you let one giver into a team,"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"you don't get an explosion of generosity."},"515":{"dur":1,"text":"More often, people are like,"},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Great! That person can do all our work.\""},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"So, effective hiring and screening\nand team building"},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"is not about bringing in the givers;"},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"it's about weeding out the takers."},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"If you can do that well,"},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"you'll be left with givers and matchers."},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"The givers will be generous"},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"because they don't have to worry\nabout the consequences."},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"And the beauty of the matchers\nis that they follow the norm."},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"So how do you catch a taker\nbefore it's too late?"},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"We're actually pretty bad\nat figuring out who's a taker,"},"543":{"dur":1,"text":"especially on first impressions."},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a personality trait\nthat throws us off."},"547":{"dur":1,"text":"It's called agreeableness,"},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"one the major dimensions\nof personality across cultures."},"551":{"dur":3,"text":"Agreeable people are warm and friendly,\nthey're nice, they're

of you\nwho are highly agreeable,"},"584":{"dur":1,"text":"or maybe slightly Canadian,"},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"you get this right away."},"587":{"dur":1,"text":"How could I ever say I'm any one thing"},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"when I'm constantly adapting\nto try to please other people?"},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"Disagreeable people do less of it."},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"They're more critical,\nskeptical, challenging,"},"597":{"dur":3,"text":"and far more likely than their peers\nto go to law school."},"600":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"That's not a joke,\nthat's actually an empirical fact."},"604":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"So I always assumed\nthat agreeable people were givers"},"607":{"dur":1,"text":"and disagreeable people were takers."},"609":{"dur":1,"text":"But then I gathered the data,"},"611":{"dur":3,"text":"and I was stunned to find\nno correlation between those traits,"},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"because it
