actually"},"4490":{"dur":4,"text":"said the line that he's\nconstantly being blamed with,"},"4495":{"dur":3,"text":"that it's like history\nwritten in lightning,"},"4499":{"dur":2,"text":"and for a

classic,"},"4509":{"dur":2,"text":"it's an incredible film,\nThe Birth of a Nation."},"4512":{"dur":3,"text":"It is also deeply racist\nbecause the punchline"},"4516":{"dur":4,"text":"of the movie is

lightning."},"4579":{"dur":3,"text":"And that is a phrase nobody that I found,"},"4582":{"dur":1,"text":"and I looked hard for it,"},"4583":{"dur":2,"text":"could trace where it actually came from."},"4586":{"dur":2,"text":"- You suggest maybe Dickson.\n- I think Dickson himself--"},"4588":{"dur":1,"text":"- The guy who wrote--\n- Who wrote the book"},"4590":{"dur":3,"text":"that the movie is based on\nand was a huge self promoter."},"4593":{"dur":1,"text":"I think he put it out there,"},"4595":{"dur":2,"text":"he knew Wilson as a graduate student."},"4598":{"dur":4,"text":"And it also seemed to be a\nconflation of another remark"},"4604":{"dur":2,"text":"made by the Chief Justice at the time."},"4606":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think all of these\nthings were put together,"},"4609":{"dur":2,"text":"and then it was attributed\nto Wilson because of course"},"4612":{"dur":1,"text":"he ran it in the White House and of course"},"4614":{"dur":2,"text":"he was a racist and so there you have it."},"4616":{"dur":2,"text":"I say if you've never\nseen Birth of a Nation,"},"4618":{"dur":2,"text":"you really ought to see it,\nit's a fascinating
