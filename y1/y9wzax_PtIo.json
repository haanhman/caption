creative"},"29":{"dur":2,"text":"and create experiences."},"31":{"dur":2,"text":"So I tried to think\nwhat I could use for here,"},"33":{"dur":2,"text":"and a couple of weeks\nago I had a crazy

me\nthroughout my life."},"62":{"dur":2,"text":"There's three particular\nthings that I've done,"},"64":{"dur":1,"text":"and I'll just describe those first,"},"66":{"dur":1,"text":"and then talk about some of my work."},"68":{"dur":3,"text":"So when I was a kid,\nI was obsessed with wires,"},"71":{"dur":3,"text":"and I used to thread them under my carpet"},"74":{"dur":1,"text":"and thread them behind the walls"},"76":{"dur":2,"text":"and have little switches\nand little speakers,"},"78":{"dur":2,"text":"and I wanted to make\nmy bedroom be interactive"},"81":{"dur":1,"text":"but kind of all hidden away."},"83":{"dur":4,"text":"And I was also really\ninterested in wireless as well."},"87":{"dur":2,"text":"So I bought one of those\nlittle kits that you could get"},"89":{"dur":1,"text":"to make a radio transmitter,"},"91":{"dur":3,"text":"and I got an old book\nand I carved out the inside"},"94":{"dur":1,"text":"and I hid it inside there,"},"96":{"dur":2,"text":"and then I placed it next to my dad"},"98":{"dur":4,"text":"and snuck back to my bedroom\nand tuned in on the radio"},"102":{"dur":1,"text":"so I could eavesdrop."},"104":{"dur":2,"text":"I was not at all interested\nin what he was saying."},"107":{"dur":1,"text":"It's more that I just liked the idea"},"108":{"dur":1,"text":"of an everyday object"},"110":{"dur":1,"text":"having something inside"},"111":{"dur":3,"text":"and doing something different."},"115":{"dur":1,"text":"Several year later,"},"116":{"dur":3,"text":"I managed to successfully\nfail all of my

out to be"},"130":{"dur":1,"text":"a one-way ticket to Australia,"},"131":{"dur":3,"text":"and I came back home\nabout four years later."},"135":{"dur":3,"text":"I ended up on a farm\nin the middle of nowhere."},"139":{"dur":2,"text":"It was in far western New South Wales."},"141":{"dur":2,"text":"And this farm was 120,000 acres."},"144":{"dur":1,"text":"There were 22,000 sheep,"},"146":{"dur":1,"text":"and it was about 40 degrees,"},"148":{"dur":2,"text":"or 100 or so Fahrenheit."},"150":{"dur":3,"text":"And on this farm there\nwas the farmer, his wife,"},"153":{"dur":2,"text":"and there was the four-year-old daughter."},"156":{"dur":2,"text":"And they kind of took me into the farm"},"159":{"dur":2,"text":"and showed me what it\nwas like to live and work."},"162":{"dur":2,"text":"Obviously, one of the most important\nthings was the sheep,"},"164":{"dur":2,"text":"and so my job was, well,\npretty much to do everything,"},"167":{"dur":3,"text":"but it was about bringing\nthe sheep back to the homestead."},"171":{"dur":1,"text":"And we'd do that by building fences,"},"173":{"dur":2,"text":"using motorbikes and horses,"},"175":{"dur":2,"text":"and the sheep would make\ntheir way all the way back"},"178":{"dur":3,"text":"to the shearing shed\nfor the different seasons."},"181":{"dur":1,"text":"And what I learned was,"},"183":{"dur":2,"text":"although at the time, like everyone else,"},"185":{"dur":1,"text":"I thought sheep were pretty stupid"},"187":{"dur":1,"text":"because they didn't do\nwhat we wanted them to do,"},"189":{"dur":3,"text":"what I realize now, probably\nonly just in the last few weeks"},"192":{"dur":2,"text":"looking back, is the sheep\nweren't stupid at all."},"194":{"dur":2,"text":"We'd put them in an environment\nwhere they didn't want to be,"},"196":{"dur":2,"text":"and they didn't want to do\nwhat we wanted them to do."},"199":{"dur":2,"text":"So the challenge was to try and get them"},"201":{"dur":0,"text":"to do what we wanted them to do"},"202":{"dur":3,"text":"by listening to the weather,\nthe lay of the land,"},"205":{"dur":2,"text":"and creating things\nthat would let the sheep flow"},"208":{"dur":2,"text":"and go where we wanted them to go."},"211":{"dur":1,"text":"Another bunch of years later,"},"213":{"dur":2,"text":"I ended up at Cambridge University"},"215":{"dur":2,"text":"at the Cavendish Laboratory in the U.K."},"217":{"dur":1,"text":"doing a Ph.D. in physics."},"219":{"dur":5,"text":"My Ph.D. was to move electrons\naround, one at a time."},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"And I realize \u2014 again, it's kind\nof these realizations"},"227":{"dur":2,"text":"looking back as to what I did \u2014"},"229":{"dur":2,"text":"I realize now that it\nwas pretty much the same"},"232":{"dur":1,"text":"as moving sheep around."},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"It really is."},"236":{"dur":2,"text":"It's just you do it\nby changing an environment."},"239":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's kind\nof been a big lesson to me,"},"241":{"dur":1,"text":"that you can't act on any object."},"242":{"dur":2,"text":"You change its environment,\nand the object will flow."},"245":{"dur":2,"text":"So we made it very small,"},"247":{"dur":2,"text":"so things were about 30\nnanometers in size;"},"250":{"dur":4,"text":"making it very cold, so\nat liquid helium temperatures;"},"255":{"dur":3,"text":"and changing environment\nby changing the voltage,"},"258":{"dur":3,"text":"and the electrons could\nmake flow around a loop"},"261":{"dur":2,"text":"one at a time, on and off,\na little memory node."},"264":{"dur":1,"text":"And I wanted to go one step further,"},"266":{"dur":2,"text":"and I wanted to move one electron on"},"268":{"dur":1,"text":"and one electron off."},"270":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was told that I wouldn't\nbe able to do this,"},"273":{"dur":1,"text":"which, you know, as we've heard\nfrom other people,"},"275":{"dur":1,"text":"that's the thing that makes you do it."},"277":{"dur":3,"text":"And I was determined, and I managed\nto show that I could do that."},"280":{"dur":1,"text":"And a lot of that learning, I think,"},"282":{"dur":1,"text":"came from being on that farm,"},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"because when I was working on the farm,"},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"we'd have to use what was around us,"},"287":{"dur":1,"text":"we'd have to use the environment,"},"289":{"dur":1,"text":"and there was no such thing"},"291":{"dur":1,"text":"as something can't be done,"},"292":{"dur":1,"text":"because you're in an environment where,"},"294":{"dur":2,"text":"if you can't do what you need to do,"},"297":{"dur":1,"text":"you can die, and, you know,"},"298":{"dur":3,"text":"I had seen that sort of thing happen."},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"So now my obsession is printing,"},"305":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'm really fascinated by the idea"},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"of using conventional printing processes,"},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"so the types of print\nthat are used to create"},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"many of the things around us"},"314":{"dur":3,"text":"to make paper and card interactive."},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"When I spoke to some printers\nwhen I started doing this"},"320":{"dur":1,"text":"and told them what I wanted to do,"},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"which was to print\nconductive inks onto paper,"},"324":{"dur":1,"text":"they told me it couldn't be done,"},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"again, that kind of favorite thing."},"327":{"dur":4,"text":"So I got about 10 credit cards and loans"},"332":{"dur":3,"text":"and got myself very close\nto bankruptcy, really,"},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"and bought myself this\nhuge printing press,"},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"which I had no idea how to use at all."},"340":{"dur":1,"text":"It was about five meters long,"},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"and I covered myself\nand the floor with ink"},"344":{"dur":3,"text":"and made a massive mess,\nbut I learned to print."},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I took it back to the printers\nand showed them what I've done,"},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"and they were like, \"Of\ncourse you can do that."},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"Why didn't you come here\nin the first place?\""},"354":{"dur":2,"text":"That's always the case."},"357":{"dur":3,"text":"So what we do is we take\nconventional printing presses,"},"361":{"dur":1,"text":"we make conductive inks,"},"363":{"dur":3,"text":"and run those through a press,\nand basically"},"366":{"dur":3,"text":"just letting hundreds\nof thousands of electrons flow"},"369":{"dur":1,"text":"through pieces of paper"},"371":{"dur":1,"text":"so we can make that paper interactive."},"373":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's pretty simple, really."},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"It's just a collection of things\nthat have been done before,"},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"but bringing them together\nin a different way."},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"So we have a piece of paper\nwith conductive ink on,"},"382":{"dur":4,"text":"and then add onto that a small circuit\nboard with a couple of chips,"},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"one to run some capacitive touch software,"},"389":{"dur":1,"text":"so we know where we've touched it,"},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"and the other to run, quite often,"},"393":{"dur":3,"text":"some wireless software so\nthe piece of paper can connect."},"397":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'll just describe a couple\nof things that we've created."},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"There's lots of different\nthings we've created."},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"This is one of them, because I love cake."},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"And this one, it's a large poster,"},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"and you touch it and it has\na little speaker behind it,"},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"and the poster talks\nto you when you touch it"},"412":{"dur":1,"text":"and asks you a series of questions,"},"414":{"dur":1,"text":"and it works out your perfect cake."},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"But it doesn't tell you\nthe cake there and then."},"418":{"dur":1,"text":"It uploads a picture,"},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"and the reason why it\nchose that cake for you,"},"422":{"dur":3,"text":"to our Facebook page and to Twitter."},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're trying to create that connection"},"428":{"dur":1,"text":"between the physical and the digital,"},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"but have it not looking on a screen,"},"432":{"dur":3,"text":"and just looking like a regular poster."},"435":{"dur":4,"text":"We've worked with a bunch\nof universities on a project"},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"looking at interactive newsprint."},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"So for example, we've created a newspaper,"},"444":{"dur":1,"text":"a regular newspaper."},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"You can wear a pair of headphones\nthat are connected to it wirelessly,"},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"and when you touch it,\nyou can hear the music"},"451":{"dur":3,"text":"that's described on the top,\nwhich is something you can't read."},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"You can hear a press conference"},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"as well as reading\nwhat the editor has determined"},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"that press conference was about."},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can press a Facebook \"like\" button"},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"or you can vote on something as well."},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"Something else that we created,"},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"and this was an idea that I had\na couple of years ago,"},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"and so we've done a project on this."},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"It was for funding from the government"},"471":{"dur":3,"text":"for user-centered design\nfor energy-efficient buildings,"},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"difficult to say, and something\nI had no idea what it was"},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"when I went into the workshop,\nbut quickly learned."},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"And we wanted to try and encourage people"},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"to use energy better."},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"And I really liked the idea that,\ninstead of looking at dials"},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"and reading things to say --"},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"looking at your energy usage,"},"492":{"dur":3,"text":"I wanted to create a poster\nthat was wirelessly connected"},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"and had color-changing inks on it,"},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"and so if your energy usage\nwas trending better,"},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"than the leaves would appear\nand the rabbits would appear"},"502":{"dur":1,"text":"and all would be good."},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"And if it wasn't, then there'd be graffiti"},"506":{"dur":1,"text":"and the leaves would fall off the trees."},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"So it was trying to make\nyou look after something"},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"in your immediate environment,"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"which you don't want to see\nnot looking so good,"},"515":{"dur":2,"text":"rather than expecting people to do things"},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"in the local environment\nbecause of the effect"},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"that it has a long way off."},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think, kind of like going\nback to the farm,"},"523":{"dur":3,"text":"it's about how to let people\ndo what you want them to do"},"526":{"dur":4,"text":"rather than making people do\nwhat you want them to do."},"531":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay."},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is the bit I'm really scared of."},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"So a couple of things I've created are,"},"537":{"dur":1,"text":"there's a poster over here"},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"that you can play drums on."},"541":{"dur":4,"text":"And I am not a musician. It seemed\nlike a good idea at the time."},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"If anyone wants to try\nand play drums, then they can."},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll just describe how this works."},"550":{"dur":3,"text":"This poster is wirelessly\nconnected to my cell phone,"},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"and when you touch it,\nit connects to the app."},"557":{"dur":6,"text":"(Drums)"},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"And it has really good response time."},"567":{"dur":4,"text":"It's using Bluetooth 4, so\nit's pretty instantaneous."},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay. Thanks."},"574":{"dur":3,"text":"(Applause)"},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's a couple of other things."},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"So this one is like a sound board,"},"583":{"dur":4,"text":"so you can touch it, and I just\nlove these horrible noises."},"588":{"dur":4,"text":"(Sirens, explosions, breaking glass)"},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, and this is a D.J. turntable."},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's wirelessly linked to my iPad,"},"601":{"dur":4,"text":"and this is a software\nthat's running on the iPad."},"605":{"dur":3,"text":"Oh, yes. I just love doing that."},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm not a D.J., though, but I just\nalways wanted to do that."},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"(Scratching)"},"614":{"dur":4,"text":"So I have a crossfader,\nand I have the two decks."},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"So I've made some new technology,"},"622":{"dur":1,"text":"and I love things being creative,"},"623":{"dur":1,"text":"and I love working with creative people."},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"So my 15-year-old niece, she's amazing,"},"628":{"dur":0,"text":"and she's called Charlotte,"},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"and I asked her to record something,"},"631":{"dur":1,"text":"and I worked with a friend called Elliot"},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"to put some beats together."},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is my niece, Charlotte."},"636":{"dur":10,"text":"(Music)"},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"Yay!"},"672":{"dur":9,"text":"(Applause)"},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's pretty much what I do."},"683":{"dur":1,"text":"I just love bringing technology together,"},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"having a lot of fun, being creative."},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"But it's not about the technology."},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"It's just about, I want to create\nsome great experiences."},"691":{"dur":1,"text":"So thank you very much."},"693":{"dur":5,"text":"(Applause)"}}
