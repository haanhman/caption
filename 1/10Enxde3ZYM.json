questions answered."},"58":{"dur":2,"text":"And the film is out\nin theaters now."},"60":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's in partnership with\nIFC, so will it be on the IFC"},"63":{"dur":0,"text":"network eventually?"},"64":{"dur":0,"text":"BILL GUTTENTAG: Yeah."},"65":{"dur":3,"text":"I think right now it's playing\nby video demand, and iTunes,"},"69":{"dur":1,"text":"and all over the place,\nby download."},"71":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's playing also\ntheatrically, as well."},"73":{"dur":2,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: Well, please join\nme in welcoming Professor"},"75":{"dur":2,"text":"Guttentag to Google as we get\nstarted on this interview."},"78":{"dur":2,"text":"So thank you very much."},"80":{"dur":3,"text":"So I really wanted to start by\nwalking me through the origins"},"84":{"dur":1,"text":"of the film."},"85":{"dur":3,"text":"The 2012 election was weighing\nheavily on our minds."},"89":{"dur":2,"text":"Was that your original focus?"},"91":{"dur":3,"text":"BILL GUTTENTAG: When I started\nwanting to do the film, I"},"94":{"dur":2,"text":"wanted to do a film about\nbeing inside a"},"96":{"dur":1,"text":"real political race."},"97":{"dur":1,"text":"I thought it would be\ninteresting to have the"},"99":{"dur":2,"text":"cameras where cameras\ntraditionally"},"101":{"dur":0,"text":"aren't allowed to go."},"102":{"dur":4,"text":"So I met with a number of\npoliticians, including a"},"106":{"dur":1,"text":"couple people who were running\nfor president."},"108":{"dur":4,"text":"And what I quickly learned is\nthat people really don't want"},"113":{"dur":4,"text":"to allow the cameras in the\nrooms where they think you"},"117":{"dur":1,"text":"shouldn't be in there."},"119":{"dur":3,"text":"So that seemed to be\ngoing nowhere."},"122":{"dur":2,"text":"At some point I contacted Chris\nLehane, who I knew."},"125":{"dur":2,"text":"And Chris was on Al Gore's\nspokesperson."},"128":{"dur":2,"text":"He was an aide to Bill Clinton\nfor eight years."},"130":{"dur":1,"text":"And I guess you would say he's\nthe leading Democratic"},"132":{"dur":1,"text":"political consultant."},"134":{"dur":4,"text":"And Chris was running a\npresidential campaign, and he"},"138":{"dur":0,"text":"liked the idea."},"139":{"dur":2,"text":"But no one is really going\nto let you into the"},"141":{"dur":1,"text":"room behind the room."},"142":{"dur":3,"text":"And as far as I know, they're\ndoesn't exist such a film."},"146":{"dur":1,"text":"There's, I guess, some\ncompelling reasons not to."},"148":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, one person I met who\nwas running for president said"},"151":{"dur":4,"text":"to me, well, what if you were\nfilming a debate prep and an"},"155":{"dur":2,"text":"aide gave me a suggestion?"},"158":{"dur":1,"text":"Would you want to\ninclude that?"},"159":{"dur":2,"text":"I said, well, that sounds like\na pretty good scene to me."},"161":{"dur":1,"text":"And he said, no, no,\nthat's a bad scene."},"163":{"dur":2,"text":"Because that shows that I'm\ntaking suggestions from my"},"166":{"dur":2,"text":"aides and don't have\nthe idea myself."},"168":{"dur":2,"text":"So it occurred to me that that's\nnot such a good idea--"},"171":{"dur":2,"text":"that there was a big zone\nof disagreement."},"173":{"dur":3,"text":"So what I thought was if you\ncan't do it as a documentary,"},"176":{"dur":1,"text":"maybe you can do it as\na fictional film."},"178":{"dur":2,"text":"And that set us on the\njourney of doing it"},"180":{"dur":1,"text":"as a fictional film."},"182":{"dur":2,"text":"But we tried to sort of\nnavigate the channel"},"184":{"dur":4,"text":"verisimilitude the whole time,\nso that the conversations"},"188":{"dur":5,"text":"you're hearing are, I think,\nreal conversations."},"193":{"dur":2,"text":"And people have said to us,\npolitical consultants"},"196":{"dur":3,"text":"especially who've seen the\nfilm, that they get these"},"199":{"dur":3,"text":"little PTSD flashbacks when\nthey watch the film."},"203":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, that's one thing that\nstruck me when I saw it."},"205":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, to a large extent, it's\nthe headlines you see and then"},"208":{"dur":4,"text":"what could be happening behind\nthe scenes to get there."},"213":{"dur":3,"text":"I think the trick in politics is\nthat everything is kind of"},"216":{"dur":0,"text":"manufactured."},"217":{"dur":2,"text":"Very few things are completely\nspontaneous."},"220":{"dur":3,"text":"So it was one person who was\nrunning for president that"},"223":{"dur":3,"text":"told me is that the idea is that\nyou never, ever want to"},"227":{"dur":1,"text":"say something spontaneous."},"228":{"dur":4,"text":"But every time you speak, you\nwant it to sound spontaneous,"},"232":{"dur":4,"text":"like it's the very first time\nthat you have said it."},"237":{"dur":2,"text":"And in some ways, acting is a\nlittle bit of a similar thing,"},"239":{"dur":2,"text":"because acting--"},"241":{"dur":3,"text":"What's wonderful about actors\nis that every time they do a"},"245":{"dur":2,"text":"take, every time they say a\nline, you're supposed to"},"248":{"dur":2,"text":"deliver this innocence, like\nit's the first time"},"250":{"dur":0,"text":"you said the line."},"251":{"dur":3,"text":"It's one of things that goes\ninto good acting is selling"},"254":{"dur":2,"text":"In a funny sort of way, politics\nis done that way."},"257":{"dur":8,"text":"I guess the line which plenty\nof people have said are that"},"266":{"dur":3,"text":"politics is Hollywood for\nless attractive people."},"269":{"dur":2,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: And so I also\nwanted to delve in a little"},"272":{"dur":1,"text":"bit to Rob Lowe's character."},"274":{"dur":3,"text":"And so could you tell me\nthe origins of that?"},"277":{"dur":2,"text":"He seems to be almost\na hired gun."},"280":{"dur":1,"text":"He has something going\non in Kentucky."},"281":{"dur":2,"text":"He has something going on in\nCalifornia in the film."},"284":{"dur":2,"text":"BILL GUTTENTAG: I think Rob Lowe\nis loosely based on my"},"287":{"dur":1,"text":"partner in the film,\nChris Lehane."},"289":{"dur":4,"text":"And these political consultants,\nthey go all over"},"294":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, they tend to work for\nissues they care about and"},"298":{"dur":1,"text":"politicians they care about."},"299":{"dur":2,"text":"But you are sort of parachuting"},"301":{"dur":1,"text":"into various races."},"303":{"dur":2,"text":"And they also do it\ninternationally, as well."},"305":{"dur":3,"text":"So what's great about Rob\nis Rob, he sort of"},"309":{"dur":2,"text":"understood the music."},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"We kind of knew the feeling\nand the things"},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"to say about it."},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"He's someone who really\ncares about politics."},"317":{"dur":2,"text":"So he was sort of a\nnatural fit to it."},"319":{"dur":3,"text":"And then we would hang out quite\na bit with Rob and Chris"},"323":{"dur":0,"text":"Lehane and myself."},"324":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think part of that is he\njust wanted to get a sense of"},"326":{"dur":2,"text":"who Chris is, the kind\nof things you say."},"329":{"dur":3,"text":"And you always want to, sort\nof, again, stay within that"},"332":{"dur":3,"text":"channel of what is real and what\nfeels like the sort of"},"336":{"dur":1,"text":"thing people really would say."},"337":{"dur":2,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: And of course,\nmost of the filling takes"},"340":{"dur":0,"text":"place in California."},"341":{"dur":3,"text":"California being its own center\nof political intrigue"},"345":{"dur":1,"text":"from referenda on forward."},"346":{"dur":5,"text":"So was the setting important\nto you to bring it here?"},"351":{"dur":1,"text":"BILL GUTTENTAG: I think that's\na terrific question."},"353":{"dur":2,"text":"I think California, people\nnaturally have a greater"},"355":{"dur":3,"text":"interest in California than\nthey do elsewhere."},"359":{"dur":4,"text":"Any film is this combination\nof art and commerce."},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"And on the art side, you can\nkind of set it any place."},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"But I think people just\nnaturally care more about what"},"368":{"dur":0,"text":"happens in California."},"369":{"dur":4,"text":"We tried to include a fair\namount of California things"},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"that would appeal\nto an audience."},"376":{"dur":4,"text":"We also had at one point the\nsenator from California,"},"381":{"dur":2,"text":"Barbara Boxer, stop by the\nset, which was sort of"},"383":{"dur":0,"text":"fascinating."},"384":{"dur":3,"text":"You had this funny combination\nof the actors playing"},"388":{"dur":0,"text":"politicians."},"389":{"dur":3,"text":"And you're sitting there with\na California senator, who's"},"392":{"dur":1,"text":"commenting on what's going on."},"393":{"dur":1,"text":"And in some ways, that's what\nwe tried to achieve in the"},"395":{"dur":3,"text":"film, is to create this\nkind of raking of the"},"398":{"dur":1,"text":"fake and the real."},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: And then similarly\nin writing it, you"},"402":{"dur":1,"text":"did most of the writing\nyourself then?"},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"It was written with Chris\nLehane, and we tried to ask"},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"ourselves are these the sort\nof things that people would"},"410":{"dur":1,"text":"really say?"},"411":{"dur":4,"text":"And we had quite a bit\nof help on it."},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"We spoke with Chris, who\nwrites speeches for"},"417":{"dur":1,"text":"politicians."},"419":{"dur":3,"text":"For reporters, we worked with\nreporters so the reporters"},"422":{"dur":1,"text":"would seem real."},"423":{"dur":2,"text":"And in fact, the film was filled\nwith, quote unquote,"},"426":{"dur":1,"text":"real people."},"427":{"dur":3,"text":"We have some well-known San\nFrancisco news personalities"},"430":{"dur":0,"text":"as reporters."},"431":{"dur":1,"text":"We have the Harvard\nprofessor Alan"},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"Dershowitz playing a lawyer."},"435":{"dur":4,"text":"We have Howie Kurtz, who has a\nshow on CNN, also playing a"},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"journalist."},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"My son who is a Teach for\nAmerica teacher, who's in"},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"there playing a teacher."},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"All along the way-- we have\na Heisman Trophy winning"},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"football player playing\na football player."},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"I think all along, we just try\nto look for people who are"},"454":{"dur":3,"text":"real, because I think they add\nthis sense of you're not just"},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"looking at actors."},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"But of course, any film\ndepends on the"},"462":{"dur":1,"text":"talents of the actors."},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"But this sort of rounds\nout the cast."},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: Absolutely."},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"And to that end as well, like\nI said, there's many threads"},"469":{"dur":0,"text":"going on too."},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"You have the drama in Kentucky,\ninto California."},"472":{"dur":3,"text":"From a narrative perspective,\nhow do you weave them together"},"476":{"dur":3,"text":"and make sure that the audience\nfollows along with"},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"the day-to-day life?"},"481":{"dur":1,"text":"BILL GUTTENTAG: That's a\nreally good question."},"482":{"dur":4,"text":"I think that when you watch\na film, there's this--"},"486":{"dur":3,"text":"I think audiences, to some\nextent, don't need to have"},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"everything filled in."},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"On the other hand, they don't\nwant to be completely lost."},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"So you'll sometimes see in a\nmovie where you'll open up"},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"with several different\nplot lines."},"498":{"dur":3,"text":"And the audience has a sense\nthat they're all going to"},"501":{"dur":1,"text":"weave together at some point."},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"And they'll hang in\nthere for a while."},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"But there has to be something\ninteresting enough within"},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"those stories that they're\ngoing to hang in."},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's a sense of\ngratification when"},"511":{"dur":0,"text":"it does hang in."},"512":{"dur":4,"text":"But when you're editing,\neverything that you do in a"},"516":{"dur":0,"text":"film is a choice."},"517":{"dur":1,"text":"Are you going to do this or\nare you going to do that?"},"519":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think you have keep an eye\non the fact that you don't"},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"want people to be too lost\nwith what's going on."},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's a little bit of a\ntricky balance at times."},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: In the end, it's\na film about an election."},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"So the election happens\non one day nationwide."},"531":{"dur":1,"text":"So that kind of draws--"},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"I think there's always a\nquestion, inherent drama,"},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"about what happens\nin an election."},"537":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, I did a TV series\nyears ago called"},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"Crime & Punishment.\" And it\nwas all about trials and"},"544":{"dur":2,"text":"And one of the things\ninteresting about trials are"},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"trials have inherent drama."},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"You have a trial."},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"There's a defendant."},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"Is that defendant going to be\nconvicted and taken out the"},"554":{"dur":4,"text":"back of the courtroom\nin handcuffs and"},"558":{"dur":1,"text":"go to jail for decades?"},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"Or are they going to go out the\nfront door a free person?"},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"And one thing that was\ninteresting, we were an NBC"},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"show, and we were on at 10\no'clock at night-- which can"},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"be a tough slot because\npeople go to bed."},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's a big deal on TV,\ntrying to cross the half hour"},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"and hold onto your ratings."},"576":{"dur":3,"text":"And in our case, we increase our\nratings like 100% of the"},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"shows over the half hour."},"581":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think the reason\nfor it--"},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"I like to think it's because\nit was a decent show."},"587":{"dur":1,"text":"But I think another part\nof the reason is"},"588":{"dur":0,"text":"people want to know--"},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"did the person get found guilty\nor did they [? get ?]"},"591":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's inherent drama\nwithin there."},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"And then that drama continued\nwith the various screenings"},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"you did last year."},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"I believe it premiered\nthe DNC."},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"Do you have any memories\nof that screening?"},"604":{"dur":1,"text":"BILL GUTTENTAG: We showed\nit at the DNC."},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's obviously a lot of--\nthe Democratic National"},"608":{"dur":0,"text":"Convention--"},"609":{"dur":1,"text":"there are a lot of politicians,\nwho I think felt"},"610":{"dur":3,"text":"like they were seeing their\nlives in there."},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"So that was a favorable crowd."},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"We also had a screening at\nHarvard, where it was sort or"},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"fascinating that--"},"621":{"dur":3,"text":"It was at the Harvard Kennedy\nSchool, and we had a number of"},"624":{"dur":4,"text":"politicians, democratic, people\nwho work for Democratic"},"628":{"dur":3,"text":"presidential candidates,\ncouple people on the"},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"Republican presidential\ncandidate side."},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"And the debate all became about\nwhether the character in"},"637":{"dur":3,"text":"the film played by Carrie-Anne\nMoss could actually win the"},"640":{"dur":1,"text":"governorship of California."},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's sort of interesting if\nyou make a film that people"},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"are actually taking\nit seriously"},"646":{"dur":1,"text":"enough to debate this."},"647":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's grounded in the fact\nthat the two most famous"},"651":{"dur":3,"text":"governors of California in\nrecent memory were both"},"655":{"dur":4,"text":"non-politicians, referring, of\ncourse to Ronald Reagan and so"},"660":{"dur":1,"text":"Arnold Schwarzenegger."},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is a state which will\nembrace someone who is not a"},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"politician and put them in\nthe highest state office."},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: And I'd like to\nfollow up a little bit more on"},"670":{"dur":1,"text":"Carrie-Anne Moss's character."},"671":{"dur":4,"text":"And I'm reminded of the film, of\ncourse, \"Mr. Smith Goes to"},"675":{"dur":4,"text":"Washington,\" the idealism being\ndragged down by the"},"680":{"dur":1,"text":"realities of modern politics."},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"So what inspired you as you\ncreated that character?"},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"Do you think that such a\ncharacter could succeed on the"},"687":{"dur":3,"text":"BILL GUTTENTAG: I think part of\nthe story involves a doctor"},"690":{"dur":3,"text":"in the Mission District who\nwould like to be governor of"},"693":{"dur":1,"text":"California, played by\nCarrie-Anne Moss."},"695":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think that the\ncharacter's an"},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"aspirational character."},"699":{"dur":4,"text":"I think the idea that if you\nhave a great sense of"},"704":{"dur":3,"text":"intelligence and compassion\nthat this will somehow"},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"connect, and you can get over\nthe fundraising issues, and"},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"all the other key issues\nthat people encounter."},"713":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think that, I hope that,\naudiences will connect with"},"717":{"dur":1,"text":"that character."},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"A lot of TV, I think, is\nsort of aspirational."},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"A lot of movies are\naspirational, too."},"724":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not the world\nas it exists."},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"It's the world as you kind\nof want it to be."},"728":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, if you see certain shows\non television, hospitals"},"732":{"dur":1,"text":"really aren't run that way."},"733":{"dur":4,"text":"Or if you watch \"The West Wing,\"\nthe White House isn't"},"737":{"dur":4,"text":"really run by a bunch of super\nsmart, completely ethical"},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"people, who always do\nthe right thing."},"744":{"dur":1,"text":"But we all hope it would be."},"746":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think that that's what\nyou come to the table with,"},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"that you hope that these\nhospital shows or the medical"},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"shows or the legal shows, that\nthis is a world that you want."},"755":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think that's one the\nreasons people will watch"},"759":{"dur":1,"text":"television or movies."},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"In part, they come to\nbe entertained."},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"In part, there's an aspirational\nquality to it."},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: And also,\nI was struck--"},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't have the quote memorized\nwith me, but the"},"771":{"dur":3,"text":"main essence was the idea of\nMachiavellianism in politics."},"775":{"dur":4,"text":"And so some of the characters\nthat the consultants are"},"779":{"dur":4,"text":"working with, they have great\nideas, but there is some"},"784":{"dur":2,"text":"questionable paths\nto those ideas."},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"People aren't running\nfor

affairs."},"798":{"dur":3,"text":"And in other countries, it\ndoesn't matter so much."},"801":{"dur":3,"text":"But in this country, whether\nit's John Kennedy or Lyndon"},"804":{"dur":4,"text":"Johnson, or you can just keep\ngoing down the list, Bill"},"809":{"dur":4,"text":"Clinton, and this is something\nthat can be a severe blow to"},"813":{"dur":3,"text":"you if you want to get ahead."},"816":{"dur":4,"text":"But the reality is that they're"},"821":{"dur":1,"text":"not running for saints."},"822":{"dur":4,"text":"And sometimes in politics, the\nlowest blows are used for the"},"826":{"dur":1,"text":"noblest ends."},"827":{"dur":4,"text":"And you have to use these sort\nof tactics if you hope to win."},"834":{"dur":3,"text":"Politics is a blood sport."},"838":{"dur":4,"text":"And they always say that your\nhardest day on the campaign"},"842":{"dur":4,"text":"trail is going to be your\neasiest day in office."},"847":{"dur":3,"text":"And so in some ways, the system\nprepares you for the"},"850":{"dur":2,"text":"blood sport ahead, which is\nalso running a country or"},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"running a state government."},"855":{"dur":3,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: And the American\npolitical scene is one thing--"},"859":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm brought to memories of\nlife in Europe, as well."},"862":{"dur":4,"text":"So has this film made its\nway across the pond?"},"866":{"dur":0,"text":"BILL GUTTENTAG: It's\ninteresting."},"867":{"dur":3,"text":"We were screening recently\nin Stockholm."},"870":{"dur":4,"text":"And I thought it was fascinating\nthat the Swedes"},"875":{"dur":2,"text":"that I met we're saying that\nthey were inundated with"},"877":{"dur":3,"text":"American politics."},"880":{"dur":1,"text":"But I think it's important."},"882":{"dur":2,"text":"So what happens in the White\nHouse actually affects what"},"885":{"dur":1,"text":"happens in Scandinavia."},"887":{"dur":4,"text":"So I think they found\nit interesting."},"891":{"dur":3,"text":"But if you look, political\nconsultants work"},"895":{"dur":0,"text":"all over the place."},"896":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, people like\nChris Lehane work"},"898":{"dur":1,"text":"all over the world."},"899":{"dur":3,"text":"There was a
