asking"},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"very important societal questions."},"423":{"dur":2,"text":"Then how we can we advance them?"},"425":{"dur":4,"text":"The only negative part of that is that now we've"},"429":{"dur":5,"text":"got even more users of the technology to advance chemistry."},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"The negative part is that it cost more"},"437":{"dur":3,"text":"so we were pretty

that's"},"477":{"dur":1,"text":"the part I'm most excited about"},"479":{"dur":3,"text":"is that bringing the community together and then"},"483":{"dur":3,"text":"building this space the NC3 space."},"486":{"dur":4,"text":"And then creating a vision so the"},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"University of Nebraska-Lincoln and as"},"493":{"dur":4,"text":"you know is that the last decayed you collectively as an"},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"institution we have a lot of progress in research and stature."},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"Why that happened?"},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that the reason for that is talent."},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"That\u2019s the most important part,"},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"everything else is secondary, talent is"},"511":{"dur":4,"text":"most important and those talented people are attracting"},"516":{"dur":3,"text":"more than chemistry and every place for the University."},"520":{"dur":6,"text":"The second part is that, it\u2019s not only football field"},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"that needs a cutting edge tool and"},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"infrastructure instrumentation."},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"I think it's a clearly in this particular"},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"case in computational chemistry"},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"unless we have the fastest machine,"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"unless we are well connected,"},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"we're not going to be at the cutting edge"},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"to address those important."},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"And the exciting part of the NC3 is that it's"},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"asking those questions, the"},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"big questions and to address whether"},"553":{"dur":1,"text":"it's environmental sciences or"},"555":{"dur":3,"text":"its bio medical and eventually it's"},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"going to improve quality for all of us."},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"So, that's the, that's really what"},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"I believe in that we've got to have talent,"},"567":{"dur":3,"text":"we've got to have facilities,"},"570":{"dur":4,"text":"but then we've got to gather not just one"},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"person Prim Paul sitting in one corner"},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"and Joe sitting in another corner,"},"579":{"dur":3,"text":"different disciplines have to come together and"},"583":{"dur":4,"text":"then work together and then asking the big questions."},"587":{"dur":3,"text":"This is a really where the UNL in the"},"591":{"dur":3,"text":"last decade or so that we made a lot"},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"of progress that we've got to"},"597":{"dur":3,"text":"come up with the big ideas and then"},"600":{"dur":6,"text":"see how can we translate those big ideas into funding."},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, money is important only to"},"609":{"dur":4,"text":"address those problems and the"},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"more and more as the budget gets"},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"tighter those who have the big ideas,"},"619":{"dur":4,"text":"those who are collaborating, not just with your department but"},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"across the University and with other"},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"institutions where it makes since."},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"Then go and let\u2019s beat up the rest of the"},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"world and bring those centers in."},"632":{"dur":5,"text":"So, my challenge to the NC3 team is;"},"638":{"dur":4,"text":"I want to pat you on the back for all"},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"the great good work you've done."},"645":{"dur":7,"text":"I'm very proud of you but I want to challenge you to think big. K?"},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"What is that big problem that we've got to solve?"},"655":{"dur":4,"text":"What makes since for us to be not local leader?"},"660":{"dur":1,"text":"Not regional leader?"},"661":{"dur":4,"text":"What is that area that we can be number one in the world?"},"666":{"dur":6,"text":"In this area, find that and work together to accomplish that."},"672":{"dur":7,"text":"So, I can assure you that once you have that you are"},"679":{"dur":1,"text":"not going to be alone."},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"We are going to be working

ideas to challenge."},"693":{"dur":3,"text":"I use to at one time when I was in the trenches"},"697":{"dur":1,"text":"but now I've gone to the dark side."},"699":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I'm really very

you need a"},"733":{"dur":1,"text":"faculty member he's one of my"},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"favorite faculty members so,"},"736":{"dur":1,"text":"I can\u2019t point tell you who the"},"738":{"dur":1,"text":"other ones are cause then we"},"740":{"dur":1,"text":"will have a little problem but he's,"},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"seriously getting the colors"},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"of the journals and all of that,"},"746":{"dur":1,"text":"so I'm very proud of you."},"748":{"dur":1,"text":"So, the long probably more

University."},"808":{"dur":3,"text":"Sometimes they refer us as that."},"811":{"dur":5,"text":"But I'm so pleased today to be able to be here with you and"},"816":{"dur":3,"text":"to represent the

and his"},"843":{"dur":2,"text":"great work and Joe you also."},"846":{"dur":3,"text":"And I will tell you if you\u2019re interested in Bio's on either of"},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"them they will be at the back of the room."},"851":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not going to focus on that."},"853":{"dur":4,"text":"Today though what I do want to just very briefly focus on,"},"857":{"dur":3,"text":"what we're celebrating today."},"860":{"dur":4,"text":"We are celebrating Eugene and Shirley Cordes"},"865":{"dur":1,"text":"and Joe Francisco and"},"867":{"dur":3,"text":"not just that they have chemistry in common but probably"},"870":{"dur":3,"text":"the most important thing they have in common is the fact"},"874":{"dur":3,"text":"that they really want to advance the University and believe"},"878":{"dur":4,"text":"in the people here and what that investment in the"},"882":{"dur":1,"text":"University will do in the future."},"884":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I first want to just acknowledge David did to."},"888":{"dur":3,"text":"Eugene has invested this time and resources."},"892":{"dur":2,"text":"His leadership for the Industrial Advisory Board in Chemistry"},"895":{"dur":4,"text":"but also for the college, for the College Campaign"},"899":{"dur":1,"text":"Committee and in that capacity."},"901":{"dur":3,"text":"So, they've done that and we're so appreciative."},"905":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're celebrating that desire today"},"908":{"dur":2,"text":"but we're also celebrating"},"910":{"dur":2,"text":"Eugene's parents today because"},"912":{"dur":2,"text":"this chair is named in their honor."},"914":{"dur":4,"text":"And as I was looking back and thinking about Eugene and"},"918":{"dur":2,"text":"Shirley coming back today to celebrate this chair."},"921":{"dur":3,"text":"I went back and I found, Eugene provided some really"},"925":{"dur":2,"text":"nice biographical information on his parents."},"928":{"dur":3,"text":"And I loved going through it and reading it, there were"},"932":{"dur":2,"text":"three pages just on their history and their life together."},"934":{"dur":5,"text":"But what I want you to know today is something that he said at"},"939":{"dur":3,"text":"the very end that really sums up what we get to do and"},"943":{"dur":1,"text":"what we get to be part of."},"944":{"dur":4,"text":"Eugene said his parents when they established the fund"},"949":{"dur":3,"text":"\"... my parents were good people,

advancing"},"979":{"dur":3,"text":"the University but it also is about honoring a legacy and"},"983":{"dur":6,"text":"a legacy that made Eugene, likely on my guesses he would"},"989":{"dur":1,"text":"say that it made him a big part of who"},"991":{"dur":2,"text":"he is today and his career."},"994":{"dur":3,"text":"So, this is one of the best parts of my job, is seeing all"},"998":{"dur":3,"text":"of this come together and I'm glad all of you get to see it too."},"1001":{"dur":5,"text":"So, to be able to bring Eugene together with Dean

the"},"1067":{"dur":2,"text":"University so Prem, terrific."},"1069":{"dur":3,"text":"Second point"},"1074":{"dur":3,"text":"is just to say that once in a while the stars and"},"1078":{"dur":4,"text":"the heavens get aligned properly and great things happen and"},"1082":{"dur":4,"text":"that great thing that's happen is that Joe Francisco has come"},"1087":{"dur":3,"text":"to the University of Nebraska- Lincoln as Dean and"},"1090":{"dur":1,"text":"as the Cordes Professor."},"1092":{"dur":2,"text":"It could not have worked out

Department."},"1105":{"dur":2,"text":"And third point is that, it's been a"},"1108":{"dur":2,"text":"pleasure to be associated"},"1111":{"dur":1,"text":"with the department,"},"1112":{"dur":1,"text":"if you look at the quality of the"},"1114":{"dur":2,"text":"department over time the first derivative is positive"},"1116":{"dur":2,"text":"but more importantly it's the"},"1119":{"dur":3,"text":"second derivative is also positive."},"1122":{"dur":1,"text":"So that the improvement of"},"1124":{"dur":1,"text":"equality is accelerating over time,"},"1125":{"dur":1,"text":"so that's terrific."},"1127":{"dur":1,"text":"Now I have the pleasure of"},"1131":{"dur":1,"text":"providing Joe Francisco with"},"1133":{"dur":2,"text":"some sort of

okay?"},"1203":{"dur":1,"text":"I think we need to think about the"},"1205":{"dur":3,"text":"third derivative to be positive, okay?"},"1208":{"dur":2,"text":"Well everybody, I'm going to"},"1215":{"dur":2,"text":"turn this now back over to"},"1217":{"dur":2,"text":"Xiao, who's going to come up and introduce, or is"},"1219":{"dur":2,"text":"David going to introduce our
