lot"},"685":{"dur":3,"text":"of sports films that we love,\nmovies like \"Rudy\" and"},"688":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Hoosiers\" and \"Rocky\" and\n\"Miracle.\" And we were"},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"determined to make a movie with\n\"Murderball\" that would"},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"feel like a fiction movie that\nwould suck you in, and had"},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"music, and had shots,\nand had sequences."},"701":{"dur":3,"text":"So it wouldn't feel like your\ntypical documentary that was"},"705":{"dur":1,"text":"just zooming in on everything\nfrom afar."},"709":{"dur":5,"text":"But now I did the exact opposite\nwith this film."},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"Everything was just\nin front of me--"},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"and usually, when you're\nshooting a documentary, it's"},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"always a struggle to just get\nsomeone's face in focus."},"723":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I found myself getting\nannoyed with all the

then it felt more\nreal to me."},"735":{"dur":3,"text":"It felt more like what I'm used\nto seeing through a lens."},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"But there are a lot of rules on\nset that I learned that are"},"742":{"dur":3,"text":"very annoying, like, you're\nsupposed to say cut."},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"You don't say cut in\ndocumentaries, OK?"},"748":{"dur":1,"text":"You would never say that."},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"So I just ended up just letting\nthe camera roll a lot."},"754":{"dur":3,"text":"And what that was wonderful\nabout that was that it kept"},"757":{"dur":3,"text":"the makeup artists, and the hair\npeople, and the booming"},"761":{"dur":3,"text":"people with their mics, and the\nguys tweaking the lights,"},"764":{"dur":1,"text":"it kept them away."},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"Because when you're rolling,\nthey don't ever want"},"768":{"dur":1,"text":"to be in the frame."},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"So they just stay at bay."},"771":{"dur":1,"text":"And then I could play."},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"And the actors could\ndo whatever and go"},"775":{"dur":1,"text":"wherever they wanted."},"777":{"dur":3,"text":"And I shot most of this movie\nwith two cameras, which means"},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"they could interrupt each other,\nor they could play the"},"783":{"dur":1,"text":"scene this way or that\nway, you could"},"784":{"dur":1,"text":"always cut it together."},"786":{"dur":3,"text":"And that was the way that I took\nback control over the set"},"790":{"dur":4,"text":"because the machinery

nothing real\nabout the process."},"801":{"dur":3,"text":"So what I would do, especially\nwith the kids, is I would move"},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"the cameras back, far, and\nsometimes, I would even put a"},"808":{"dur":4,"text":"light, like there's a light my\nface now, I would hit a light"},"812":{"dur":1,"text":"towards them so they\ncouldn't even see"},"814":{"dur":1,"text":"I did that quite a lot."},"816":{"dur":1,"text":"And then they would forget that\nthe cameras were even"},"818":{"dur":0,"text":"filming them."},"819":{"dur":1,"text":"And I would say, go again,\ngo again, go

script."},"850":{"dur":2,"text":"And then we got further\naway from the script."},"852":{"dur":3,"text":"And I would just tell them\nto do it in their words."},"855":{"dur":5,"text":"Sometimes, for certain scenes\nthat required more emotion, I"},"861":{"dur":1,"text":"just wanted to see what they\nwould come up with."},"866":{"dur":4,"text":"Most directors, the idea of\ndirecting is very aggressively"},"871":{"dur":4,"text":"dominating and imposing your\nwill or viewpoint on people."},"875":{"dur":4,"text":"And I, because I come from\ndocumentaries, thought of
