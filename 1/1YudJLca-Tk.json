get\nstarted with describing"},"22":{"dur":2,"text":"just a little bit\nthe visual system."},"25":{"dur":3,"text":"The visual system\nbasically looking"},"28":{"dur":2,"text":"across different creatures,\ndifferent animals,"},"30":{"dur":1,"text":"is fundamentally the same."},"32":{"dur":2,"text":"And at the very core,\nit's the capacity"},"34":{"dur":4,"text":"of the brain to reach out and\nto look into the environment."},"39":{"dur":3,"text":"And one of the fascinating\nthings about the visual system"},"42":{"dur":2,"text":"is that it's really\nadapted to accommodate"},"44":{"dur":2,"text":"the different needs of\ndifferent creatures."},"46":{"dur":5,"text":"So humans in particular have\nvery strong needs, one of which"},"52":{"dur":2,"text":"is actually to recognize\nfacial expression."},"55":{"dur":4,"text":"And clearly, as humans we\nhave developed technology"},"59":{"dur":2,"text":"that goes hand in hand\nwith our visual capacity."},"62":{"dur":4,"text":"So overall, put together,\nabout 80% of what we perceive"},"67":{"dur":3,"text":"and comprehend, but\nalso remember and plan,"},"70":{"dur":1,"text":"is based on visual information."},"72":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're really technological\ncreatures, I mean,"},"74":{"dur":1,"text":"and this is probably\none of the best places"},"76":{"dur":1,"text":"to highlight this point."},"78":{"dur":2,"text":"But it's really not\njust about survival."},"80":{"dur":3,"text":"It's survival, but also\nexpanding our capacity"},"84":{"dur":4,"text":"in terms of our ability\nto read, to learn, to plan"},"88":{"dur":2,"text":"the future, which\nreally goes hand in hand"},"91":{"dur":3,"text":"with our technological capacity\nand our visual

visual information."},"107":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is a little bit\ntricky to comprehend."},"110":{"dur":4,"text":"So if we look\noverall at longevity,"},"115":{"dur":2,"text":"we all know that\npeople live longer."},"117":{"dur":3,"text":"The numbers are quite\namazing when we look at them."},"121":{"dur":4,"text":"And so if you just look at\nwhat was the reality just about"},"125":{"dur":3,"text":"100 years ago, people\ndidn't live very long."},"128":{"dur":3,"text":"So modern medicine\nhad immense capacity"},"131":{"dur":4,"text":"at prolonging life and making\nall of us live much longer."},"136":{"dur":1,"text":"So clearly there\nare some differences"},"137":{"dur":2,"text":"between developing and\ndeveloped countries."},"140":{"dur":4,"text":"But generally in the developed\nworld, people live very long."},"144":{"dur":3,"text":"And this has to do\nwith the ability"},"147":{"dur":3,"text":"to eradicate a lot\nof diseases that"},"151":{"dur":4,"text":"typically cause early death."},"156":{"dur":3,"text":"Now how does that\nrelate to vision?"},"159":{"dur":2,"text":"So one of the consequences\nof living longer"},"162":{"dur":4,"text":"is the fact that certain\ndiseases, as I mentioned,"},"166":{"dur":1,"text":"have disappeared."},"167":{"dur":2,"text":"But on the other hand,\nseveral other diseases"},"169":{"dur":3,"text":"that were unknown before\nare becoming very prevalent."},"173":{"dur":3,"text":"And one of them is AMD,\nor age-related macular"},"176":{"dur":2,"text":"degeneration, which\nis the situation where"},"179":{"dur":2,"text":"the central part of our\nmacula, or central part"},"182":{"dur":1,"text":"of our visual system,\nwhich is the macula, it's"},"183":{"dur":4,"text":"the center of the retina,\nbecomes degenerate."},"188":{"dur":3,"text":"And that means that\nwhen we age, there's"},"191":{"dur":1,"text":"an onset of the disease."},"193":{"dur":1,"text":"And when we look\nat the population"},"194":{"dur":3,"text":"of 80-year-olds\nand above, there's"},"197":{"dur":2,"text":"a staggering number\nof people that"},"200":{"dur":1,"text":"will suffer from this disease."},"201":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you go ahead\nand extrapolate"},"204":{"dur":4,"text":"what would be the situation\nin 20 years, in 50 years,"},"208":{"dur":2,"text":"the numbers are going\nto be very high."},"210":{"dur":3,"text":"So the current estimates\nis by the year 2050,"},"214":{"dur":1,"text":"among the American\npopulation, there"},"216":{"dur":3,"text":"would be over 5 million\npeople suffering from AMD."},"219":{"dur":3,"text":"Now AMD doesn't mean\ntotal blindness,"},"223":{"dur":2,"text":"but what AMD means\nis that our capacity"},"225":{"dur":4,"text":"to read, to write,\nto recognize faces"},"229":{"dur":4,"text":"is severely damaged to the\npoint that in many patients"},"234":{"dur":1,"text":"it's damaged completely."},"235":{"dur":3,"text":"And the consequences are loss\nof independence, depression,"},"239":{"dur":4,"text":"and a major financial burden\non the patients themselves,"},"243":{"dur":4,"text":"but also on additional\ncircles of family and friends."},"248":{"dur":3,"text":"So by this point\nyou're all spooked."},"252":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is probably\nthe time to start"},"253":{"dur":3,"text":"talking about the future and\nthe technological solutions."},"257":{"dur":1,"text":"And so this is\nwhere we introduced"},"259":{"dur":1,"text":"the issue of artificial vision."},"261":{"dur":3,"text":"Now artificial vision sounds\nlike complete science fiction."},"264":{"dur":3,"text":"But in fact, over the\nlast several decades,"},"268":{"dur":2,"text":"there is a whole range\nof related technologies"},"271":{"dur":1,"text":"that have been\ndeveloped and have"},"273":{"dur":3,"text":"been proven to do\njust what we're"},"276":{"dur":1,"text":"aiming to do in\nartificial vision."},"278":{"dur":2,"text":"So cochlear implants\nare devices that"},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"are implanted in the\ncochlea in the ear"},"283":{"dur":5,"text":"and have been used already\nwith just over 200,000 people."},"289":{"dur":4,"text":"And what these devices do, they\ncan take auditory information,"},"293":{"dur":2,"text":"transfer that into\nelectrical stimulation,"},"295":{"dur":3,"text":"and stimulate nerve\ncells, and basically"},"298":{"dur":7,"text":"address the nerve track in order\nto stimulate information that"},"306":{"dur":4,"text":"ultimately is conceived\nas auditory information."},"311":{"dur":4,"text":"And so this technology has\nbeen really the trigger"},"315":{"dur":3,"text":"and the motivation to develop\nadditional technologies"},"319":{"dur":1,"text":"such as the artificial vision."},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"And so artificial\nvision are devices"},"323":{"dur":1,"text":"that you see on the\nright-hand side."},"325":{"dur":3,"text":"These are actually devices,\nactual prototypes, two of which"},"329":{"dur":3,"text":"have already passed\neven regulatory cycles"},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"and are approved for use\nnot for AMD patients,"},"335":{"dur":1,"text":"but for RP patients."},"337":{"dur":4,"text":"And such devices utilize\nmicrofabrication technology"},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"and allows people to see."},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"Now what does it mean,\nit allows people to see?"},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"It allows them to\nhave the sensation"},"349":{"dur":1,"text":"of visual information."},"351":{"dur":3,"text":"So what these pioneering\nstudies have demonstrated"},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"is several very\nfundamental issues."},"357":{"dur":2,"text":"First, it has\ndemonstrated the fact"},"360":{"dur":1,"text":"that you can build a device."},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"You can implant it\nfor a long term."},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can transfer\nelectrical signals"},"366":{"dur":3,"text":"that are perceived by the\nbrain as visual information."},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"The second point is\nthat you can also"},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"demonstrate using cochlear\nimplants and these implants,"},"375":{"dur":5,"text":"that the brain plasticity have\nthe capacity to, over time,"},"380":{"dur":4,"text":"to understand better and better\nthis visual information that"},"385":{"dur":1,"text":"is being transferred."},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"So basically the science\nfiction part of it"},"389":{"dur":3,"text":"has been taking a little\nbit out of it in the sense"},"392":{"dur":4,"text":"that we know that these things\nare technologically possible."},"396":{"dur":3,"text":"The challenge remains\nthough that the systems that"},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"have been developing over\nmany, many, many years--"},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"this is a long path it\ntakes from the design"},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"to the actual realization of\nthese devices-- they're still"},"408":{"dur":5,"text":"very bulky, very big, require\nexternal energy source,"},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"and requires extensive wiring."},"415":{"dur":3,"text":"And often this wiring\nhas to extend out"},"419":{"dur":3,"text":"of the eyeball, which makes the\nwhole thing pretty messy when"},"423":{"dur":2,"text":"you think about it in terms\nof surgical procedures."},"425":{"dur":6,"text":"So that the moon shot thought\nis really to take all of that"},"432":{"dur":3,"text":"and turn that into\na compact device,"},"436":{"dur":6,"text":"basically something that can\nbe inserted neatly into the eye"},"442":{"dur":1,"text":"and placed against the retina."},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is clearly\nwhat you would"},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"like to do when you talk\nabout an artificial retina,"},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"but then the question is how\ndo you go about doing that?"},"451":{"dur":5,"text":"So what you really need is new\nmaterials, either new polymers,"},"457":{"dur":3,"text":"new nanotechnology tools, just\ntools that actually did not"},"461":{"dur":4,"text":"exist when the original\nartificial retina devices were"},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"beginning to be developed."},"468":{"dur":3,"text":"So now we do have new\nmaterials available."},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"And what we've been\ntrying to do is really"},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"to go back to the\nvery basics and to try"},"477":{"dur":4,"text":"to imitate the system to the\nvery, very fundamental levels."},"481":{"dur":5,"text":"So a natural system is\nrelied on photoreceptors."},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"The photoreceptors\nare the elements"},"489":{"dur":3,"text":"that are degenerated in AMD."},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"And what you want is\nactually the capacity"},"494":{"dur":3,"text":"to be able to elicit\nelectrical information instead"},"498":{"dur":3,"text":"of those elements, instead\nof these photoreceptors that"},"501":{"dur":0,"text":"are gone."},"502":{"dur":3,"text":"Now in the natural system,\nespecially in the macula,"},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"there are a lot of\nthese photoreceptors."},"508":{"dur":1,"text":"There's a very high\ndensity of them."},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"And they operate in\na very efficient way."},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"And so what we're\ntrying to do is"},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"to use carbon\nnanotube as a scaffold"},"517":{"dur":3,"text":"onto which we want to\nintroduce energy harvesting"},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"elements or photo\nharvesting elements,"},"523":{"dur":1,"text":"and the combination\nof these two,"},"525":{"dur":3,"text":"the photo conducting\nelements on the one hand"},"528":{"dur":4,"text":"and the carbon nanotube as a\nscaffold on the other hand,"},"533":{"dur":3,"text":"can simultaneously generate\nthe needed electric field,"},"537":{"dur":3,"text":"which is needed in order\nto stimulate the retina."},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"Now in terms of actually\ndemonstrating that,"},"544":{"dur":3,"text":"so one approach that we've\ndemonstrated very recently"},"547":{"dur":4,"text":"with colleagues from Bangalore\nis using conductive polymers."},"551":{"dur":3,"text":"So you can take newly-developed\nconducting polymers,"},"555":{"dur":3,"text":"deposit them on the\ninterface of electrodes."},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"You can take a blind retina,\nplace the blind retina"},"562":{"dur":4,"text":"on the interface, shine\nlight in a very precise way,"},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"and demonstrate that\nthe retina can see."},"569":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is a blind retina that\nsees visual information that"},"573":{"dur":4,"text":"are mediated by the\nspecial interfaces."},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"The actual approach, or\nthe major effort in my lab,"},"581":{"dur":3,"text":"is actually to use the carbon\nnanotubes as a scaffold."},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is an ongoing\nwork that we've"},"587":{"dur":3,"text":"been doing for the past 10 years\nin which we've been constantly"},"591":{"dur":3,"text":"demonstrating the great\nadvantage of using carbon"},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"nanotubes for this application."},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"So carbon nanotubes have\nseveral fundamental properties,"},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"which are really ideal\nfor this application."},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"One is that it's almost\nlike a natural Velcro, which"},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"makes a very strong\nand intimate contact"},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"with biological systems."},"610":{"dur":3,"text":"And we've been demonstrating\nthat in vitro, ex vivo,"},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"and in vivo."},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"So these are absolutely\nfantastic materials"},"617":{"dur":3,"text":"in binding to the\nbiological system."},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"The other thing is that they\nare a fantastic electrochemical"},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"system, and you can\nuse them as electrodes"},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"both for recording\nand stimulation."},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"You can really convince\nyourself that you"},"630":{"dur":3,"text":"obtain absolutely fantastic\nrecording capabilities just"},"634":{"dur":5,"text":"because of their very large,\nthree-dimensional structure."},"639":{"dur":4,"text":"The other thing, which comes\nfrom their entangled nature,"},"644":{"dur":4,"text":"is the fact that you can make\nfilms from these surfaces."},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"You can work out the fabrication\nprocess in such a way"},"651":{"dur":3,"text":"that you can integrate that\ninto many different carriers,"},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"into polymeric carriers, which\nare biocompatible, and can"},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"automatically integrate\nthis whole system"},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"into a standalone device."},"664":{"dur":4,"text":"So when you take all of these\ntogether and use the carbon"},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"nanotube as a\nscaffold, and now bring"},"670":{"dur":5,"text":"into this party,\nthe quantum rods,"},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"now you have a system\nthat can do both."},"678":{"dur":4,"text":"It can anchor or bind to\nthe biological system,"},"682":{"dur":4,"text":"but it can also do\nthe energy transfer"},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"of taking photons\nand converting them"},"689":{"dur":3,"text":"into charge separation,\nwhich ultimately stimulate"},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"the retina."},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"Now there's a lot of\nscience in the science"},"695":{"dur":1,"text":"fiction in the sense\nthat you really"},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"have to work out\na lot of details."},"699":{"dur":1,"text":"There are many,\nmany, many details,"},"701":{"dur":3,"text":"and I have exactly 32\nseconds to lay them out."},"705":{"dur":4,"text":"But you really have to work\nabout how you couple the carbon"},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"nanotubes and the quantum dots."},"712":{"dur":1,"text":"You really have to make\nsure that the system"},"714":{"dur":3,"text":"is stable and biocompatible,\nthat the charge transfer"},"717":{"dur":3,"text":"happens in such a way that\nit doesn't damage the system."},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"And all of these things have\nto be, of course, proven."},"723":{"dur":3,"text":"But once you do that, you\nactually realize that it works."},"727":{"dur":4,"text":"And you can demonstrate again,\nusing blind retina, ex vivo,"},"731":{"dur":5,"text":"that using nice,\nsharply-defined optical pulses,"},"736":{"dur":1,"text":"that you can\nstimulate the retina"},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"and reconstruct visual\ninformation in essentially"},"741":{"dur":1,"text":"a blind system."},"742":{"dur":1,"text":"So there's a long\nway to go in order"},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"to fill the full\npicture of this."},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"But this is where\nwe're at at the moment"},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"and really looking\nforward for the future."},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"So just to conclude,\nthe real challenge"},"756":{"dur":4,"text":"is really at the bottom,\nnot just to extend life,"},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"but really to make sure\nthat this prolonged life is"},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"happy, healthy, and independent."},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"So thank you very much."}}
