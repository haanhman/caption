people make when buying branding"},"66":{"dur":1,"text":"or designing their logo."},"68":{"dur":2,"text":"So my first tip is around"},"71":{"dur":1,"text":"doing it yourself."},"73":{"dur":1,"text":"So doing it yourself is great"},"75":{"dur":3,"text":"because it can potentially\nbe free, fantastic."},"78":{"dur":1,"text":"But the thing that's gonna be missing"},"80":{"dur":2,"text":"if you're not a graphic designer,"},"82":{"dur":1,"text":"you're not gonna create something"},"84":{"dur":1,"text":"which necessarily represents"},"85":{"dur":2,"text":"the true value of your business."},"87":{"dur":2,"text":"A graphic designer will\nlook into the core values"},"90":{"dur":3,"text":"of your business and how long\nit's been established for"},"94":{"dur":1,"text":"and all that sort of thing."},"97":{"dur":2,"text":"They will be using their experience,"},"99":{"dur":2,"text":"dozens of years, tens\nof years of experience"},"102":{"dur":1,"text":"in the graphic design industry"},"103":{"dur":1,"text":"and designing things, generally,"},"105":{"dur":4,"text":"to know how to represent the\nbest value for your logo."},"112":{"dur":2,"text":"There are very subtle\ndifferences in design"},"116":{"dur":1,"text":"which happen"},"119":{"dur":3,"text":"on a very subconscious way"},"123":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's based on feeling"},"124":{"dur":2,"text":"so if we look at something,"},"126":{"dur":3,"text":"so say for example, if I\nlook away from the camera now"},"130":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'm just kind of talking into space,"},"132":{"dur":2,"text":"immediately, you're kinda still engaged,"},"134":{"dur":1,"text":"you're probably listening to me"},"135":{"dur":3,"text":"but your level of trust\nfor me has just gone down."},"139":{"dur":2,"text":"Compared to if I face you\nand look at the camera"},"141":{"dur":3,"text":"you can see that all of a\nsudden you can see my face,"},"145":{"dur":2,"text":"my facial expressions directly,\nI'm looking straight at you"},"148":{"dur":3,"text":"and the level of trust is much greater."},"151":{"dur":3,"text":"So the same principles apply to branding."},"154":{"dur":3,"text":"If you have a logo designed"},"157":{"dur":1,"text":"and there's something not quite right"},"159":{"dur":2,"text":"about the colour schemes,\nthe fonts you've used,"},"162":{"dur":2,"text":"the way, you know if it's\nslightly cliche to whatever,"},"164":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll talk about that later on."},"166":{"dur":2,"text":"People just feel like\nthey don't quite trust it"},"169":{"dur":4,"text":"and that means that their\ntrust level is lowered"},"174":{"dur":2,"text":"and they're less likely\nto engage with you."},"176":{"dur":1,"text":"So when I talk about engagement,"},"177":{"dur":1,"text":"we're talking about picking up the phone,"},"179":{"dur":1,"text":"speaking to you, asking about\nyour products and services"},"181":{"dur":1,"text":"and things like that."},"182":{"dur":2,"text":"So like I said, imagine that\nyou've got the difference"},"185":{"dur":2,"text":"between somebody looking directly\nat you and talking to you"},"188":{"dur":2,"text":"or looking away from\nyou and talking to you,"},"190":{"dur":2,"text":"how does that make you feel?"},"192":{"dur":1,"text":"How does this make you feel,"},"193":{"dur":1,"text":"when I'm talking to you personally?"},"195":{"dur":4,"text":"The principles of design\nare really, really important"},"199":{"dur":3,"text":"and that's why if you're not a\nprofessional graphic designer"},"202":{"dur":2,"text":"and you decide to design\nyour logo yourself"},"205":{"dur":1,"text":"you may be lowering the trust"},"206":{"dur":3,"text":"that is given to your potential customers."},"210":{"dur":3,"text":"My second tip is based\naround colour schemes."},"214":{"dur":4,"text":"I use the kiss principle,\nso keep it simple stupid."},"218":{"dur":2,"text":"The moment you go from\none colour to two colours"},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"in your logo, your colour palette,"},"224":{"dur":1,"text":"there's double the amount of information"},"225":{"dur":3,"text":"for somebody viewing\nyour logo to remember."},"229":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's why you'll see a lot"},"231":{"dur":2,"text":"of one of the big design\ntrend at the moment"},"233":{"dur":4,"text":"is for logos to be a single block"},"238":{"dur":1,"text":"of flat colour basically,"},"240":{"dur":1,"text":"so we call it flat design"},"242":{"dur":2,"text":"because it's just easier to remember."},"244":{"dur":2,"text":"A common thing that's going\naround on Facebook at the moment"},"247":{"dur":3,"text":"in the design world, certainly,"},"250":{"dur":1,"text":"is if I asked you to remember"},"252":{"dur":3,"text":"what is the colour of\nthe G in the Google logo,"},"255":{"dur":1,"text":"could you remember?"},"259":{"dur":2,"text":"So the answer's blue,\nif you go and look at it"},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"but off the top of your head\ncould you have remembered that?"},"264":{"dur":1,"text":"And the reason why you can't remember"},"265":{"dur":3,"text":"is because there's an element\nthat might be insignificant"},"269":{"dur":2,"text":"but also there's just too\nmuch information to remember"},"271":{"dur":2,"text":"because they've got about\nfour or five colours in there."},"273":{"dur":3,"text":"But Google is Google and they\ncan kinda get away with that."},"277":{"dur":1,"text":"For the smaller, lesser known brands,"},"278":{"dur":2,"text":"if you introduce colour\nit just builds noise"},"281":{"dur":1,"text":"and confusion into your logo."},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"So reduce the number of\ncolours down that you're using"},"285":{"dur":1,"text":"as much as you can."},"286":{"dur":1,"text":"If you remember back in the day,"},"288":{"dur":4,"text":"Apple computers or Apple started\nout life as Apple computers"},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"and if you look at their\nfirst logo it's just a mess."},"295":{"dur":1,"text":"The second version of the logo"},"296":{"dur":1,"text":"was much more like the Apple symbol"},"298":{"dur":2,"text":"which you remember today\nbut it's a rainbow colour,"},"300":{"dur":1,"text":"so it's got horizontal colours,"},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"about eight different\ncolours in it and it's awful."},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"So go and have a look at the\nevolution of the Apple logo"},"307":{"dur":1,"text":"and you start to know what I mean."},"308":{"dur":2,"text":"Now it's just a single\noutline, no drop-shadows,"},"311":{"dur":3,"text":"no gradients, just one block\nof colour, nice simple outline."},"314":{"dur":4,"text":"My third tip is based around\nthe use of brand guidelines."},"318":{"dur":1,"text":"Brand guidelines are there, essentially,"},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"it can be like a one or two\npage document simple as that"},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"with your logo spacing,\ncolour palette laid out"},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"and typefaces that you're\ngonna use in your brand."},"328":{"dur":1,"text":"The reason why this is so important"},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"is when you get some sign\nwriting done on your van,"},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"if you're gonna get some\nbusiness cards printed out,"},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"if you're gonna get somebody\nto design your brochure,"},"337":{"dur":2,"text":"everybody's singing\nfrom the same hit sheet"},"339":{"dur":1,"text":"and all of your design,\nyour branding assets"},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"are gonna be really, really consistent."},"343":{"dur":4,"text":"So having a, literally, it's\na two pager, PDF document"},"347":{"dur":1,"text":"you can send out to a designer or printer"},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's got the colour\nreferences on there"},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"and high res versions of the logo ready"},"354":{"dur":2,"text":"which you can send with the PDF."},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"Just explains to people\nhow to use your brand"},"358":{"dur":1,"text":"and then everything will be consistent."},"360":{"dur":1,"text":"If things aren't consistent,"},"361":{"dur":1,"text":"going back to what I\nwas saying about trust,"},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"people if they get an\ninconsistent message,"},"366":{"dur":1,"text":"say they look at your sign"},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"and the logo's different to your website"},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"they might look at them and think,"},"371":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Well, they're not the same company.\""},"372":{"dur":1,"text":"and go away and be confused"},"374":{"dur":3,"text":"and go and find another provider."},"378":{"dur":2,"text":"So consistency is the key here."},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"The fourth thing is having too many fonts."},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"There's nothing wrong with\nhaving a typeface for your logo"},"386":{"dur":1,"text":"and then a different typeface"},"387":{"dur":1,"text":"for the headings on your website"},"389":{"dur":5,"text":"and then have a standard sans\nserif font for your body text."},"394":{"dur":2,"text":"But I would suggest you\ndon't want anymore than three"},"397":{"dur":3,"text":"in terms of fonts, and\nkeep them really simple."},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"Don't forget, you can have"},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"some really creative\nlike arty fonts like this"},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"but how easy is this to read"},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"compared to your very standard like Ariel,"},"408":{"dur":4,"text":"Helvetica or Sans Serif fonts?"},"412":{"dur":3,"text":"This logo here represents\nthe surfboard brand"},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"so it represents that brand well,"},"419":{"dur":3,"text":"but you wouldn't use this\non perhaps their website"},"422":{"dur":4,"text":"so much because it will\nbe difficult to read"},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"and again lowers the trust\nlevel, lowers the engagement"},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"and people don't buy\nyour products as a result"},"431":{"dur":1,"text":"or a lower number of people"},"432":{"dur":1,"text":"will buy your product as a result."},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"So where and how you use fonts"},"436":{"dur":1,"text":"is really, really important"},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"and the number of fonts you use as well."},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"The fifth tip which I've got"},"443":{"dur":4,"text":"is about how, like the\nemblem you might use"},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"within your logo."},"449":{"dur":1,"text":"So I was just talking\nabout it's my fifth tip,"},"451":{"dur":1,"text":"these are my top five buying mistakes,"},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"common buying mistakes\nwhen it comes to branding."},"454":{"dur":4,"text":"My fifth tip is about\nwhat the logo looks like"},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"so if it's too abstract or too cliched"},"461":{"dur":1,"text":"people just aren't going to get it."},"463":{"dur":1,"text":"If somebody says to\nyou, \"I like your logo,"},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"\"what does it mean, how\ndid you end up with that?\""},"467":{"dur":1,"text":"Then it's not doing it's job,"},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"remember kiss, keep it simple, stupid."},"470":{"dur":3,"text":"If you've got to explain\nyour logo to people"},"473":{"dur":3,"text":"it's doing something wrong."},"477":{"dur":3,"text":"It should be, you can go with\nsome element of abstract,"},"480":{"dur":3,"text":"as long as you can explain\nit in like four or five words"},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"then great but if it's any more than that"},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"it's just not really representing\nyour business very well."},"489":{"dur":4,"text":"So if it's, and I hate cliches,\nlike the art typical IFA,"},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"saving for a rainy day,\nman under an umbrella."},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"God, it's sick making, like seriously."},"500":{"dur":4,"text":"Either just get rid of that cliche,"},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"that metaphor altogether"},"506":{"dur":4,"text":"or, well yeah, just get rid of it"},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"because people will see through that"},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"and just think boring or ..."},"517":{"dur":1,"text":"Again, it just lowers the level of trust"},"518":{"dur":1,"text":"which you're trying to build here"},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"with your potential new clients."},"523":{"dur":4,"text":"So my sixth tip is based\non the value of branding."},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"So here we're not talking\nabout how much it costs,"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"so typically when people\nthink of graphic design"},"532":{"dur":1,"text":"they think of paying a designer"},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's a cost to their business."},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"Where as actually I consider branding"},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"to be a vital asset to your business."},"540":{"dur":1,"text":"It should build value in your business"},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"and make it more appealing\nto potential customers"},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"and therefore it's not a cost"},"547":{"dur":1,"text":"that sits on your profit and loss account,"},"549":{"dur":3,"text":"it is an asset which sits\non your balance sheet,"},"552":{"dur":1,"text":"it's as simple as that."},"554":{"dur":3,"text":"It's something which is going to create"},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"positive affirmation,\nconfirmation when people see,"},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"you know if they've met you in person,"},"563":{"dur":1,"text":"they go to your website,\nyour branding looks great,"},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"they're gonna be more likely to buy"},"567":{"dur":3,"text":"than if for some reason\nyou've done the logo yourself,"},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"the color's not quite right,\nthe font's not quite right,"},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"the trust level starts to get lowered."},"576":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you pay a professional\ngraphic design branding agency"},"579":{"dur":4,"text":"to produce your brand it\nshould generate business."},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"So at the end of the day,"},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"this game's all about making money,"},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"selling products, selling services,"},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"we do that through making\nourselves look awesome, basically."},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"When I say make ourselves look awesome"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean make your logo, your\nbrand, your colour schemes"},"595":{"dur":1,"text":"all sing and dance for your business"},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"and really work for you."},"599":{"dur":1,"text":"One example I use,"},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"that's not to say that you can't get"},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"really great value for money\nfrom a great graphic designer"},"605":{"dur":5,"text":"cause the Nike swoosh cost\nthem the princely sum of $24."},"610":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's quite cheap\nconsidering how big Nike is,"},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"must be 10s of billions of dollars"},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"if not 100s of billions of dollars"},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"in terms of valuation now."},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"If you compare that then to the cost"},"624":{"dur":3,"text":"of the Amazon logo which\nwas 24 million dollars,"},"628":{"dur":3,"text":"you'd probably say,\n\"God, 24 million dollars,"},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"\"that's expensive for a logo, isn't it?\""},"634":{"dur":1,"text":"It is if it was just for a logo,"},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"the thing is Amazon is worth\n100s of billions of dollars,"},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"so 24 million dollars is\nnothing really in comparison."},"641":{"dur":3,"text":"But when you look at how well known"},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"and how recognised the Amazon logo is"},"647":{"dur":3,"text":"and the fact of how heavily\nprotected that logo is"},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"and the value that that\nadds to that business,"},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"24 million dollars is cheap in reality,"},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"compared to the value that it's\ncreating for that business."},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"So I mentioned the Nike swoosh,"},"662":{"dur":1,"text":"obviously they outsourced that,"},"663":{"dur":1,"text":"I think they put that on a job-site"},"665":{"dur":4,"text":"and they got it done for $24, 24 bucks."},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's nothing wrong\nwith outsourcing design,"},"671":{"dur":1,"text":"but one thing which I will say is be,"},"673":{"dur":1,"text":"don't just outsource, don't just say,"},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Right, here you go graphic\ndesign, go and design my logo.\""},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"Be actively involved in\nthe creative process,"},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"don't forget you own the brand,\nthis is for your business."},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"So go and sit down with\nyour graphic designer,"},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"like sketch some ideas out with him,"},"686":{"dur":1,"text":"like talk about colours with him,"},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"talk about your core\nvalues and how your emblem,"},"690":{"dur":4,"text":"your logo's gonna reflect the\ncore values of your business."},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"And when he's mocking it up on his Mac,"},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"like sit there and point at it"},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"and say, \"Look can you\nmove this a pixel here,"},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"\"can you possibly make that\nblue a little bit darker.\""},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"Whatever it is be actively\ninvolved in the creative process,"},"705":{"dur":1,"text":"don't just give it to them and say,"},"707":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Right, go and do me three logos"},"708":{"dur":1,"text":"\"and I'll choose the best one.\""},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"Because it just never works like that,"},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"it takes months and it's\njust an arduous process."},"714":{"dur":1,"text":"So workshop it, sit down one-to-one"},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"with your graphic designer\nand get it nailed in a day"},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"and you'll get much\nbetter results out of it."},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"Outsourcing definitely works,"},"724":{"dur":1,"text":"graphic designers will have"},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"a huge amount more creative input"},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"than if you're doing it yourself."},"731":{"dur":1,"text":"So tip number eight,"},"732":{"dur":3,"text":"we do this exercise of\nlooking at the core values"},"736":{"dur":3,"text":"of the business before we\nembark on the design process."},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"Core values are really simple things like,"},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"turn up to work with a smile."},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're looking at the products,"},"747":{"dur":4,"text":"are they fun, high quality,\ncutting edge, shiny,"},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"technical, whatever the core values,"},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"key words that you come\nup with for your products,"},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"for your customers, for your business"},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"and the owners of the business."},"761":{"dur":3,"text":"These are all really important\nfor the creative process"},"764":{"dur":3,"text":"because your logo has to\nreflect those core values."},"768":{"dur":2,"text":"Cause what you don't want is a, you know,"},"770":{"dur":2,"text":"imagine this logo for a surf wear brand"},"773":{"dur":3,"text":"which reflects the surf wear brand,"},"776":{"dur":2,"text":"imagine this logo for a tech\nbusiness, a tech startup."},"779":{"dur":1,"text":"It just wouldn't work,"},"783":{"dur":4,"text":"so even those core value of tech"},"788":{"dur":3,"text":"versus the surf wear\nand the sorts of people"},"792":{"dur":1,"text":"who are gonna be buying those products"},"793":{"dur":1,"text":"as you can see will be\ncompletely different"},"794":{"dur":1,"text":"and will have a major\nimpact on what the logo"},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"and the brand look like."},"798":{"dur":2,"text":"My penultimate tip is about"},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"how you go about protecting your brand,"},"804":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's not just that\nwe've designed a logo,"},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"now we own it type thing."},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"Or we've come up with a company name,"},"812":{"dur":3,"text":"it's available at Compass\nHouse as a business name"},"815":{"dur":1,"text":"so therefore we own it."},"816":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not as simple as that,"},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"somebody may have already\ntrademarked the brand name"},"821":{"dur":1,"text":"that you're gonna be using."},"822":{"dur":3,"text":"They may have also\nprotected the design rights"},"826":{"dur":3,"text":"to the brand which you're creating."},"829":{"dur":1,"text":"So there are four key things"},"831":{"dur":4,"text":"which we cheque whenever\nwe create a new brand"},"835":{"dur":1,"text":"before we start to\nfinalise all the designs"},"837":{"dur":2,"text":"and concepts and things like that."},"839":{"dur":2,"text":"So we cheque the main name\nto see if they're available,"},"841":{"dur":1,"text":"we cheque at Compass House"},"843":{"dur":2,"text":"or whatever your countries equivalent is"},"845":{"dur":2,"text":"to see whether the\ncompany name is available."},"848":{"dur":3,"text":"We cheque whether the\ntrademarks are avaialble"},"851":{"dur":4,"text":"on both the IPA.gov.uk website"},"855":{"dur":5,"text":"and the U.S. Trademarks\nand Patent Office website."},"860":{"dur":3,"text":"On a local UK, European"},"864":{"dur":4,"text":"and worldwide location,"},"868":{"dur":1,"text":"so you can have three different\nlevels of trademarking"},"870":{"dur":2,"text":"and also whether the design\nrights are available."},"873":{"dur":1,"text":"Design rights aren't something"},"874":{"dur":1,"text":"which I know huge amounts about"},"875":{"dur":2,"text":"but I know if they're\nsomething you're interested in"},"877":{"dur":3,"text":"I can put you in touch\nwith my trademark lawyer,"},"881":{"dur":3,"text":"IP lawyer who'll be able to help you out."},"885":{"dur":2,"text":"So do protect it and look\ninto it and do the research"},"888":{"dur":2,"text":"because it's more of an insurance policy"},"890":{"dur":1,"text":"so that like in five years time"},"892":{"dur":1,"text":"after spending all this money"},"894":{"dur":1,"text":"and getting brand loyalty"},"895":{"dur":2,"text":"you then don't want to be\ntold that you can't use it"},"897":{"dur":1,"text":"and you gotta go through\nthis whole process again"},"899":{"dur":3,"text":"and reprint and redesign\nall of your assets"},"902":{"dur":2,"text":"that you've created to reflect your brand."},"906":{"dur":4,"text":"So, my final tip, and this is really key,"},"910":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm sure all of you've experience this"},"913":{"dur":1,"text":"and I've got a few issues probably"},"915":{"dur":1,"text":"with an old version of my book."},"916":{"dur":2,"text":"I've just launched a new\nversion of the book, actually."},"919":{"dur":2,"text":"There were some typos in there, agh."},"921":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't mind admitting it"},"923":{"dur":2,"text":"because in my eyes there kind of mine"},"925":{"dur":2,"text":"and people can see past\nthat, but I have OCD."},"928":{"dur":2,"text":"When I am reading a book if I spot a typo"},"931":{"dur":4,"text":"it just really bugs me,\nit just really knocks me."},"935":{"dur":3,"text":"Like a lot of people\nwhen they develop a brand"},"938":{"dur":3,"text":"or a brochure or sign-write\nvan or do their business
