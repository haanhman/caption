it's run by a\nmarket-research company, Ipsos"},"421":{"dur":0,"text":"MORI."},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"And they basically contact\nyou via email and say,"},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"would you like

happened?"},"441":{"dur":1,"text":"HJ: I got sent an\nemail link, saying"},"443":{"dur":4,"text":"that I'd been one of the chosen\nto do the student survey."},"448":{"dur":3,"text":"And the survey just asked\na bunch of questions,"},"452":{"dur":4,"text":"like, how happy are you\nwith teaching, support,"},"456":{"dur":1,"text":"the students' union?"},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"And it could ask\nthings whether you're"},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"happy on different scales."},"461":{"dur":1,"text":"Or there's some\nboxes where you can"},"463":{"dur":1,"text":"leave some comments, as well."},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"And, yeah, it was a bit varied."},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"It doesn't take too long,\neither, which is a good thing."},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"SOPHIE: I was just about to say."},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"You look at it, and you\nthink, oh, gosh, it's"},"472":{"dur":1,"text":"going to be really long."},"474":{"dur":1,"text":"But actually,\nbecause you get into,"},"475":{"dur":1,"text":"it asks you the right\nquestions, and you"},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"can get give comments\nand some feedback."},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"And then it's sort of\ndone with, in 10 minutes."},"482":{"dur":0,"text":"So, yeah."},"483":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Brilliant."},"484":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, if you get\ncontacted to do it,"},"485":{"dur":1,"text":"please do take the\ntime to fill that in."},"487":{"dur":1,"text":"It's also really\ninteresting, when"},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"you're studying social\nsciences and often doing"},"491":{"dur":1,"text":"your own research\nprojects, to see"},"492":{"dur":1,"text":"what it's like participating\nin someone else's research,"},"494":{"dur":0,"text":"as well."},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"I often find that\nquite interesting."},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"But the NSS is really important\nto us, as a university."},"499":{"dur":1,"text":"And they help us understand\nwhat we're doing."},"501":{"dur":1,"text":"And, in fact, events\nlike the Student Hub Live"},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"have come directly from some of\nthat feedback, where students"},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"said that they wanted more\nopportunities to explore"},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"their interests with other\nstudents and academics."},"511":{"dur":0,"text":"So, please do fill that in."},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"Your feedback really is

really,"},"518":{"dur":1,"text":"really do want to know."},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"So, as I've said before,\nthose come to you on an email,"},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"and they're through the\nmarket-research company Ipsos"},"524":{"dur":0,"text":"MORI."},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"So, please do take part in\nthat, if you're asked to."},"527":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, another thing that you\ncan do is fill in an award,"},"531":{"dur":3,"text":"if you think one of your\ntutors has been outstanding."},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"So, the Open University\nStudents Association"},"537":{"dur":3,"text":"are inviting nominations\nfor the outstanding tutor."},"541":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is part of the\nOU's teaching awards."},"542":{"dur":2,"text":"So, every

particularly\nsupportive, encouraging"},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"in their studies."},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"Tutors really are important,\naren't they, Sophie and HJ?"},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"And we're going to\nbe talking to Matt"},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"Staples about the important\nrole of the tutor."},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"But sometimes they can\nseem a little bit removed,"},"561":{"dur":2,"text":"both physically, I\nguess, and emotionally."},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"Have you had a tutor that's\ndone something particularly"},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"wonderful, that\nyou might nominate?"},"568":{"dur":1,"text":"HJ: Yes."},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"Probably just putting up\nwith me as a student for--"},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"[LAUGH] would be--"},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"someone would be in line\nfor an award for that."},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"But one of my tutors\nwas really brilliant."},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"And I went to one\nof his tutorials"},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"which was a little\nbit away from me."},"583":{"dur":4,"text":"And I knew he was travelling\non the train back to Cardiff,"},"587":{"dur":1,"text":"so I said, oh, do you\nmind if I join you?"},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"And perhaps you could talk\nthrough some of my TMAs"},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"with me--"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"see what I could do overall to\nimprove-- perhaps some tips?"},"596":{"dur":1,"text":"And he did!"},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"So [LAUGH] I sat on\nthe train with him"},"600":{"dur":1,"text":"on the way back to Cardiff."},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"And he kindly went\nthrough my TMAs,"},"603":{"dur":1,"text":"and we actually went\nfor lunch after."},"605":{"dur":0,"text":"So that was

brilliant tutor."},"611":{"dur":5,"text":"and his advice really helped\nme get the score I got overall"},"617":{"dur":0,"text":"in that module."},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"So, I was very happy\nwith that, yes."},"619":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Excellent."},"620":{"dur":1,"text":"SOPHIE: I had a\ntutor, actually--"},"622":{"dur":1,"text":"I used to have to\nhandwrite mine,"},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"although I was with the\nOU, because I did math,"},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"or I'm doing maths."},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"So, instead of scanning\nthem in, she actually"},"629":{"dur":1,"text":"lived sort of in\nbetween where I live now"},"631":{"dur":0,"text":"and where my dad lives."},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"So I would drop\nthe off on the way,"},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"so I could make sure\nthey were delivered,"},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"rather than put\nthem in the post."},"637":{"dur":1,"text":"And that really\nhelped, actually,"},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"just secure the peace of mind\nthat she had it in her hand"},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"before the deadline."},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"And there was no postal\nerrors or

has gone that extra\nmile, above and beyond"},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"your expectations, then you\ncan write only 300 words"},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"to sum up why your\ntutor's

about maybe the\nway that your tutor supports"},"665":{"dur":0,"text":"you?"},"666":{"dur":3,"text":"And also the impact of that\nbehaviour on your work."},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"So, if you think

earlier,"},"910":{"dur":2,"text":"thinking about how we\napply that to Christmas."},"912":{"dur":3,"text":"And the first one that got\nus is about taking notice."},"915":{"dur":3,"text":"And that, I guess, is about\nbeing mindful and aware"},"918":{"dur":1,"text":"of what's happening."},"920":{"dur":3,"text":"And for me, one of those things\nthat really sort of stands out,"},"923":{"dur":2,"text":"after maybe the tenth game\nof Charades, where I'm sort"},"926":{"dur":2,"text":"of bombing at that and\nnot doing especially well,"},"928":{"dur":0,"text":"getting a

a\nbit of a struggle,"},"952":{"dur":1,"text":"I sort of try and notice that."},"954":{"dur":2,"text":"Because I think that's\nreally quite a helpful thing"},"956":{"dur":1,"text":"to draw my

Yeah."},"1011":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, the physical one--"},"1012":{"dur":2,"text":"it is tricky, because\nyou're not so motivated,"},"1015":{"dur":3,"text":"I guess, to go outside\nwhen it's really cold."},"1018":{"dur":2,"text":"And so the weather does\nplay a part in that."},"1020":{"dur":3,"text":"So, if it's 2 degrees outside\nand it's heaving with rain,"},"1024":{"dur":3,"text":"then you're sort of thinking,\nmmm, I probably won't do that."},"1027":{"dur":2,"text":"And the other, I think,\nis, a lot of times people"},"1029":{"dur":1,"text":"are in different

we've asked you to\nfeed back on our widgets."},"1233":{"dur":1,"text":"And one of the\nthings that you've"},"1234":{"dur":2,"text":"said you're really\nstruggling with about

can't\nit, Mathijs, to feel motivated?"},"1249":{"dur":1,"text":"MATHIJS LUCCASEN:\nOh, definitely, yeah."},"1251":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think the thing\nis that we sort of want"},"1253":{"dur":3,"text":"to balance the activity with\nsome relaxation, as well."},"1257":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's a sort of--"},"1258":{"dur":3,"text":"I think, with the pressures\nof the

overwhelmed."},"1267":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Because,\nthey're saying,"},"1268":{"dur":1,"text":"time is the next best problem."},"1270":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's that balance,\nisn't it-- what"},"1271":{"dur":2,"text":"to do with the limited\ntime that you've got?"},"1273":{"dur":0,"text":"OK."},"1274":{"dur":1,"text":"So, what's the next of\nthe ideas that we're"},"1276":{"dur":1,"text":"going to focus on now?"},"1277":{"dur":3,"text":"MATHIJS LUCCASEN: Well, the\nnext is about gifts and giving."},"1280":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think this is a real\npressure point for many people,"},"1283":{"dur":4,"text":"because you mentioned\nearlier about social media."},"1287":{"dur":2,"text":"And one of the things, I\nguess, that people cite"},"1290":{"dur":1,"text":"is, you know,\npeople have pictures"},"1291":{"dur":2,"text":"on social media of sort\nof, stacked metres, high,"},"1294":{"dur":1,"text":"these gifts, you know."},"1295":{"dur":3,"text":"And a lot of people\ndon't have the money"},"1298":{"dur":3,"text":"to be buying all these gifts."},"1302":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think what the thing is to\nfocus on, in terms of wellness,"},"1305":{"dur":2,"text":"is how we can give in\nmany different ways."},"1308":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's not just about\nfinancially giving and getting"},"1310":{"dur":2,"text":"the most expensive gift."},"1313":{"dur":4,"text":"But, like, when HJ and Sophie\nwere talking about tutors,"},"1317":{"dur":2,"text":"one of the things\nthat people can give"},"1319":{"dur":2,"text":"is actually kind\nwords and deeds."},"1322":{"dur":3,"text":"So, it's not just about, I\nguess, the material giving."},"1325":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think it's the
