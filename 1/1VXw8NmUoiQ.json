that is and what kinds of issues\nfall under that umbrella term."},"279":{"dur":3,"text":">>Dr. Patrick Stewart:\nNeuropathy is a generalized term that's used"},"282":{"dur":5,"text":"to describe nerve dysfunction, so it's not\nfunctioning, acting the way it's supposed"},"287":{"dur":1,"text":"to."},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"That can be in the form of loss of sensation,\nnumbness, tingling."},"291":{"dur":5,"text":"It can be in the form of not having as much\nstrength in that nerve distribution."},"296":{"dur":4,"text":"For hand surgeons, the most common compression\nneuropathy is referred to as carpal tunnel."},"301":{"dur":5,"text":"And that is the median nerve being compressed\nin the wrist underneath the transverse

where"},"312":{"dur":4,"text":"this, where, when you're dealing with carpal\ntunnel, where exactly in the hand is that"},"316":{"dur":1,"text":"occurring?"},"317":{"dur":4,"text":">>Dr. Patrick Stewart:\nSo, the long blue rubber band here represents"},"321":{"dur":1,"text":"one of the flexor tendons."},"322":{"dur":4,"text":"So, we have two flexor tendons to each of\nour fingers usually, sometimes only one to"},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"the small finger, and then one to the thumb."},"329":{"dur":3,"text":"Those go through this tunnel, which is right\nhere."},"332":{"dur":4,"text":"The ligament runs from sort of this bony structure\nacross to these bony structures."},"336":{"dur":4,"text":"So, that's the reason that we can get into\ntrouble is that three sides of the tunnel"},"341":{"dur":1,"text":"are surrounded by bone."},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"Bone doesn't expand really well without breaking."},"345":{"dur":5,"text":"And the ligament is sort of a thick, canvas\nlayer, so it serves as a protective function."},"350":{"dur":4,"text":"But if it gets thickened, if it gets increased\npressure, it has limited ability to expand"},"355":{"dur":3,"text":"or bow, and therefore then we develop pressure."},"358":{"dur":3,"text":"The tendons deal with pressure a lot better\nor more easily than the nerves do."},"362":{"dur":1,"text":"The nerves are an extension of our brain."},"363":{"dur":1,"text":"The brain doesn't like increased pressure."},"365":{"dur":2,"text":"And when it gets it, then it tells us about\nit."},"368":{"dur":5,"text":"And most commonly the way it will tell patients\nis at night, they may wake up and they may"},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"have some numbness and tingling in their fingers."},"376":{"dur":2,"text":"That can occur commonly because of sleeping\nposition."},"378":{"dur":5,"text":"We always talk to patients about if they're\nsort of huggers and they crank their wrist"},"383":{"dur":3,"text":"down, the farther we flex our wrist down,\nthe more pressure we put on that nerve."},"387":{"dur":3,"text":"So, it's one thing to do it for five minutes\nwhile you're doing an activity."},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"It's very different thing to do it for two\nor three hours while you're sleeping."},"393":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's often why people wake up."},"395":{"dur":4,"text":"Similarly if they have an extended position\nin their wrist, they're putting more tension"},"399":{"dur":1,"text":"or pressure on that nerve."},"400":{"dur":2,"text":">>Lori Banks:\nOkay, so we tend to think of people who get"},"403":{"dur":3,"text":"carpal tunnel, a lot of people who do a lot\nof computer work."},"406":{"dur":3,"text":"Is that the typical culprit or cause of carpal\ntunnel syndrome?"},"410":{"dur":2,"text":">>Dr. Patrick Stewart:\nIt actually is not."},"412":{"dur":6,"text":"There's a common belief that has occurred,\nand they've looked at this over time because"},"418":{"dur":1,"text":"it's important."},"419":{"dur":4,"text":"It's important to know what does and what\ndoesn't put us at an increased risk."},"424":{"dur":3,"text":"And the activities that do are forceful and\nrepetitive."},"427":{"dur":4,"text":"So, data entry in and of itself is not forceful."},"431":{"dur":6,"text":"Now that we've gotten to the point where most\nof the work stations, computer desks are more"},"438":{"dur":4,"text":"ergonomic, they put our hands in a reasonable\nposition, that has not been as much of an"},"442":{"dur":1,"text":"issue."},"443":{"dur":3,"text":"Now I have had a patient, and I'll tell people\nthat that's my opinion."},"446":{"dur":1,"text":"Sometimes they don't necessarily like that."},"448":{"dur":3,"text":"But and they said, \"Well have you ever had\na patient that you said their data entry was?\""},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"And I did, but it was a rather unique situation."},"455":{"dur":4,"text":"This was somebody who did monitoring and did\nquality assurance in a factory, and they were"},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"having to monitor parts, and they would have\nto enter data."},"462":{"dur":4,"text":"Well they happened to keep knocking their\nkeyboard off out in the factory, and it would"},"466":{"dur":1,"text":"break."},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"And their supervisor got upset with that,\ndidn't want to keep replacing it."},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"So, they literally screwed the keyboard to\nthe wall."},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"So, this person had to

subsequently"},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"developed carpal tunnel from that."},"481":{"dur":4,"text":"But running a jackhammer, where you have a\nforceful, repetitive activity, but also vibration"},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"is really a problem."},"488":{"dur":1,"text":"And cold exposure."},"489":{"dur":4,"text":">>Lori Banks:\nOkay, so construction jobs and jackhammering,"},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"and..."},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"What about... and then cold."},"496":{"dur":1,"text":"Why is cold a factor?"},"498":{"dur":2,"text":">>Dr. Patrick Stewart:\nIt's interesting, that was discovered actually"},"500":{"dur":4,"text":"through primarily the forestry industry and\nmeatpackers."},"505":{"dur":4,"text":"And there's a very, very high incidence, and\nit's the cold that adds to it."},"510":{"dur":3,"text":"Because, you can take people who do similar\nthings, but are no necessarily doing it in"},"513":{"dur":1,"text":"a refrigerated environment."},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, we're not talking about air conditioning,\nobviously, we're talking about cold enough"},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"that it preserves the meat."},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"And they have a much higher incidence of developing\ncarpal tunnel."},"522":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Banks:\nAlright, so what are some of the symptoms"},"524":{"dur":1,"text":"of carpal tunnel?"},"525":{"dur":1,"text":"What does it feel like?"},"526":{"dur":2,"text":">>Dr. Patrick Stewart:\nMost commonly it will be numbness and tingling."},"529":{"dur":3,"text":"Everybody, some will say it's a buzzing sensation."},"532":{"dur":1,"text":"Some say it feels like pins and needles."},"534":{"dur":6,"text":"It can then become more annoying or become\nburning, what we call dysesthesias."},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"That usually will happen, again, at night."},"543":{"dur":1,"text":"But it can happen after prolonged activities."},"544":{"dur":1,"text":"One of the things is driving."},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"Patients will commonly come in and say, \"Boy,\nI'm driving down the road, I take my hands"},"549":{"dur":3,"text":"down off the wheel, sort of shake them and\nput them back up on the wheel.\""},"553":{"dur":4,"text":"So, a prolonged activity is something where\nthat'll bring those symptoms out."},"557":{"dur":4,"text":"If it gets farther down the road, you can\nhave problems manipulating small items."},"562":{"dur":4,"text":"I'll ask patients or I'll put something on\nthe desk, and I'll say, \"Pick that up.\""},"567":{"dur":3,"text":"And oftentimes if they've gotten to the point\nwhere they're having those difficulties, they'll"},"570":{"dur":4,"text":"actually take those, scoop them into the other\nhand because they can't pick them up with"},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"their fingertips."},"575":{"dur":4,"text":"They can't put their hand in their pocket\nand identify a quarter vs. a nickel because"},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"just they've lost that sensibility."},"584":{"dur":4,"text":"Farther down the line most commonly then is\nwe lose motor, so we lose some strength."},"588":{"dur":4,"text":"And for carpal tunnel it's the movement of\nthe thumb, where what makes this different"},"592":{"dur":4,"text":"from that gorilla, my first patient, is the\nability to oppose our thumb to bring it out"},"597":{"dur":4,"text":"of the plane of the hand so we can grasp things."},"602":{"dur":1,"text":"The simians can only do this."},"603":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Banks:\nOh, I didn't know that."},"604":{"dur":2,"text":">>Dr. Patrick Stewart:\nSo, by our being able to do that involves"},"607":{"dur":4,"text":"this muscle here, which is innervated by the\ncarpal tunnel nerve, median nerve."},"612":{"dur":3,"text":"And we have some patients that'll come in\nthat have had it for so long, that that is"},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"gone."},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"It's completely flat, and they cannot elevate\ntheir thumb."},"619":{"dur":3,"text":"That then requires a more complex surgery\nto reconstruct that ability doing a tendon"},"623":{"dur":1,"text":"transfer for that patient."},"625":{"dur":2,"text":">>Lori Banks:\nSo, at what point should someone see their"},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"doctor?"},"629":{"dur":4,"text":"And then can you... you obviously don't do\nsurgery right away."},"634":{"dur":3,"text":"But when, let's start with when should someone\nsee their doctor about this?"},"637":{"dur":2,"text":">>Dr. Patrick Stewart:\nWell if they're having just nighttime symptoms,"},"640":{"dur":3,"text":"a reasonable place to start is starting with\njust cock-up wrist splints, and that's something"},"644":{"dur":3,"text":"that can be purchased at any one of the pharmacies."},"647":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's just designed to hold your wrist\nin a neutral position, sort of relatively"},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"straight, maybe a little bit of extension."},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"And that prevents you from sleeping in that\nfunny position."},"657":{"dur":4,"text":"If that doesn't resolve it, then you should\nbe-- because what we don't want to do is sort"},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"of misdiagnose and let something be farther\ndown the road."},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"Because, there are other things that can cause\nnumbness and tingling in the hands that we"},"668":{"dur":3,"text":"don't want to ignore or push down the road,\nas far as diagnosis."},"671":{"dur":2,"text":">>Lori Banks:\nOkay, so when you do have to go in and do"},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"surgery, what are you doing?"},"675":{"dur":3,"text":">>Dr. Patrick Stewart:\nWe're actually releasing that ligament that"},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"goes over the top of the nerve and those tendons."},"682":{"dur":5,"text":"And so, I always describe it as this is sort\nof a flat-top roof, and what we're doing is"},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"we're going in and releasing that ligament."},"689":{"dur":4,"text":"And when there's pressure, when we release\nthat what happens is that pulls back and elevates."},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"By doing that, we've taken the flat-top roof\nand we've given it a pitch."},"696":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, we've increased the volume of the\ntunnel and taken pressure off the nerve."},"699":{"dur":2,"text":">>Lori Banks:\nAlright, so where do you do an incision then"},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"at?"},"703":{"dur":2,"text":">>Dr. Patrick Stewart:\nFor carpal tunnel, if we're doing a standard"},"705":{"dur":5,"text":"carpal tunnel release, and this is done very\ndifferently depending on your training."},"711":{"dur":3,"text":"Years ago people were making an incision,\nand it could be an incision from there to"},"714":{"dur":2,"text":"there to release the median nerve."},"716":{"dur":6,"text":"As the anatomy and technology has gotten better,\nwe've been able to shorten that incision."},"723":{"dur":3,"text":"So, a standard carpal tunnel incision will\noftentimes be here."},"726":{"dur":5,"text":"I do mine endoscopically, so I was trained\nfrom the beginning, so I make a small incision"},"732":{"dur":1,"text":"here."},"733":{"dur":1,"text":"I like that from the fact that--\n>>Lori Banks:"},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm trying to show that to the camera, and\nmy arm just does not bend that way!"},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"[laughing]\nI'll go like this."},"739":{"dur":2,"text":">>Dr. Patrick Stewart:\nBecause by making an endoscopic incision,"},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't have an incision on the palm of the\nhand."},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"If patients are going to have difficulty after\ncarpal tunnel, most commonly it's tenderness"},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"across here, especially with loading."},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that's decreased by not having the\nincision there."},"752":{"dur":3,"text":">>Lori Banks:\nOkay, so a one-centimeter incision sounds"},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"like a much better deal than a big thing right\nhere."},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"So, what are the, what's the recovery like\nif you have that?"},"763":{"dur":2,"text":">>Dr. Patrick Stewart:\nFor our patients, again this has changed dramatically."},"766":{"dur":3,"text":"They used to cast patients or splint them,\nand they would be off and not doing anything"},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"for six or eight weeks."},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"We put them in a soft dressing, so their fingers\nare free."},"773":{"dur":1,"text":"They don't have any splint, they can move."},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"I tell them use their hand as they're comfortable."},"777":{"dur":3,"text":"I said if it's a little bit of discomfort's\nokay, you shouldn't be in pain to do anything."},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"They're not going to undo what I did at surgery\nby releasing it."},"784":{"dur":4,"text":"But they can make it sore, they could cause\nsome additional bruising, so we don't want"},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"them to go out and get crazy."},"791":{"dur":4,"text":"But a week after surgery we change to a bandaid."},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"At two weeks we take the one stitch out."},"797":{"dur":1,"text":"There's one suture."},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I allow patients to progress back."},"801":{"dur":4,"text":"Most patients are back to regular activities,\nregardless if it's jackhammering or working"},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"in an office, or taking care of their kids\nat four weeks, no restrictions."},"809":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Banks:\nThat's not bad."},"810":{"dur":2,"text":"Once you have that surgery, can you get this\ncarpal tunnel back?"},"813":{"dur":1,"text":">>Dr. Patrick Stewart:\nYou can."},"814":{"dur":2,"text":"The published data says five to 10% at 10\nyears."},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that personally is high."},"819":{"dur":6,"text":"I've been in practice now for over 16 years,\nand I'm not redoing five or 10% of my patients,"},"826":{"dur":2,"text":"and I've been doing it for more than 10 years."},"828":{"dur":1,"text":"So, I think that's a bit high."},"830":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's returning back to the activities\nthat may have put them at that increased risk."},"834":{"dur":3,"text":"Now the caveat I always tell patients is vibration."},"837":{"dur":3,"text":"Vibration will put you at an increased risk,\nbut it's also something the nerves in general"},"841":{"dur":1,"text":"do not like."},"842":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's the reason that if we run a weed\neater, after a few minutes your nerves are"},"846":{"dur":3,"text":"like, you know, you feel a little numb because\nthey're telling you put that down, it's vibrating."},"850":{"dur":4,"text":"Well you finish the yard because you have\nto, and then you sit down and your hands may"},"854":{"dur":3,"text":"be numb for five or 10 minutes."},"857":{"dur":4,"text":"Patients who have had carpal tunnel and vibration\nhas been a significant component of that,"},"861":{"dur":3,"text":"if they go back and they have to run a palm\nsander or a grinder, or something like that,"},"865":{"dur":3,"text":"I'll tell them that oftentimes your numbness\nand tingling will come back after you use"},"868":{"dur":2,"text":"that implement, and it may last for a day."},"871":{"dur":2,"text":">>Lori Banks:\nOkay, it kind of hangs out for a while."},"873":{"dur":1,"text":">>Dr. Patrick Stewart:\nYeah, it doesn't mean that the carpal tunnel"},"875":{"dur":4,"text":"or the pressure is back, but the nerve is\nsensitized to that particular aggravating"},"879":{"dur":1,"text":"factor."},"880":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, I have some patients where they do\nthat all week, and so essentially their hands"},"884":{"dur":1,"text":"are numb all week."},"885":{"dur":4,"text":"But sometime on Saturday the numbness is gone,\nand then they're able to enjoy their weekend."},"889":{"dur":4,"text":"But they know because that's their job that\nthey have to, but their carpal tunnel is not"},"893":{"dur":1,"text":"back."},"894":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Banks:\nOkay, there was another term that came up"},"896":{"dur":2,"text":"in my research, and that's cubital tunnel."},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"What' the difference between carpal and cubital?"},"901":{"dur":1,"text":"Am I saying it right?"},"902":{"dur":1,"text":">>Dr. Patrick Stewart:\nYou are."},"903":{"dur":1,"text":"This is the second most common compression\nneuropathy."},"905":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is of the ulnar nerve."},"906":{"dur":4,"text":"So, first it's a different nerve, and it's\nobviously in a different place."},"911":{"dur":5,"text":"The median nerve, carpal tunnel we were talking\nabout, can be compressed here."},"916":{"dur":4,"text":"The median nerve can also be compressed in\nmore of the proximal forearm under the muscle."},"920":{"dur":1,"text":"Much, much less common."},"921":{"dur":2,"text":"The ulnar nerve is sort of the opposite."},"923":{"dur":3,"text":"The ulnar nerve can be compressed here at\nthe elbow, at the funny bone as everybody"},"927":{"dur":1,"text":"refers to it."},"928":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori

feeling."},"940":{"dur":2,"text":"So, that nerve is at the elbow."},"942":{"dur":3,"text":"It can be compressed at the wrist sort of\nright next to the carpal tunnel, much

it's\ninflammation."},"983":{"dur":3,"text":"So, it causes discomfort in movement of that\ntendon."},"987":{"dur":4,"text":"The most common tendinitis we see are down\nin the hands, like in the
