Habitat Loss.\""},"57":{"dur":2,"text":"And now, Dr. Elizabeth Hadly."},"59":{"dur":4,"text":"[applause]"},"64":{"dur":6,"text":"[HADLY:] Thank you \n and welcome from me as well."},"70":{"dur":3,"text":"I want to say \n that I'm just delighted to be here."},"74":{"dur":3,"text":"I think that out of 30-some years"},"77":{"dur":4,"text":"that I've been working in the field \n of biology and paleontology and geology,"},"81":{"dur":4,"text":"now is the most critical time \n in my life."},"85":{"dur":4,"text":"And I'm really excited \n to be able to talk to you"},"90":{"dur":3,"text":"because I think this is the world \n you inherit."},"93":{"dur":5,"text":"And I personally have witnessed a lot \n of changes on this planet."},"98":{"dur":0,"text":"And what I want"},"99":{"dur":2,"text":"to do over my next two lectures is give"},"101":{"dur":2,"text":"you some examples about the kind of work"},"104":{"dur":2,"text":"that I've done and that we're continuing"},"106":{"dur":1,"text":"to do in my lab,"},"108":{"dur":2,"text":"but I also want to implore you"},"110":{"dur":3,"text":"to think about how the kinds \n of things you're learning today,"},"114":{"dur":2,"text":"or you will learn about today, can"},"116":{"dur":2,"text":"influence the choices \n you make in your own future."},"120":{"dur":2,"text":"So my job \n today is to tell you a little bit"},"122":{"dur":4,"text":"about how humans really \n do impact biodiversity on the planet"},"126":{"dur":3,"text":"and to tell you what biodiversity is \n and why it matters."},"132":{"dur":2,"text":"There are lots \n of levels of biodiversity,"},"134":{"dur":1,"text":"but as biologists,"},"136":{"dur":3,"text":"we like to divide them \n into these kind of four categories."},"140":{"dur":2,"text":"There's the ecosystem level;"},"142":{"dur":3,"text":"and for this example \n I've chosen the Yellowstone ecosystem."},"146":{"dur":2,"text":"Yellowstone Park, \n shown at the center there,"},"148":{"dur":1,"text":"with the black box around it,"},"150":{"dur":2,"text":"it's located in Montana, Wyoming,"},"153":{"dur":1,"text":"and Idaho,"},"154":{"dur":3,"text":"and that park \n is the world's first national park."},"158":{"dur":2,"text":"It was founded in 1872."},"161":{"dur":1,"text":"When it was founded,"},"162":{"dur":2,"text":"it's really remarkable \n to think about the foresight"},"165":{"dur":3,"text":"of the people that decided \n to establish a national park,"},"168":{"dur":2,"text":"because it was just one tiny part"},"170":{"dur":4,"text":"of a vast western wild set \n of ecosystems."},"175":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, you can see the western border \n of Yellowstone from space,"},"180":{"dur":1,"text":"and you can see that border"},"182":{"dur":3,"text":"because the forests \n on the western border"},"185":{"dur":1,"text":"have been cut down."},"188":{"dur":3,"text":"So Yellowstone, even though the forests \n have been cut down there,"},"192":{"dur":2,"text":"the national park \n preserves everything within it."},"195":{"dur":3,"text":"It doesn't allow us to do \n any kinds of alterations,"},"198":{"dur":2,"text":"except for those related to supporting"},"201":{"dur":3,"text":"the three-plus-million people \n that visit there per year."},"205":{"dur":2,"text":"But the ecosystems shown in this yellow"},"207":{"dur":5,"text":"is protected indirectly by places \n like the BLM lands"},"213":{"dur":1,"text":"and national forest lands"},"215":{"dur":1,"text":"and wilderness areas."},"217":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a pretty large system"},"219":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's large enough to encompass \n the range of the grizzly bear,"},"223":{"dur":1,"text":"for example."},"224":{"dur":3,"text":"These large animals, the elk \n that migrate in and out of the park"},"228":{"dur":3,"text":"itself in herds \n of thousands of individuals."},"232":{"dur":1,"text":"Microbes and hot springs:"},"233":{"dur":1,"text":"we don't drill hot springs"},"235":{"dur":4,"text":"here for thermal energy like hot springs \n everywhere else in the world."},"240":{"dur":4,"text":"And all sorts of birds \n and other large and small animals."},"244":{"dur":5,"text":"This ecosystem then interacts, \n there are these iconic species."},"249":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a place \n where we protect their interactions,"},"253":{"dur":3,"text":"but it's also comprised \n of individual species."},"256":{"dur":2,"text":"And species vary across their range."},"259":{"dur":1,"text":"Every species in the world,"},"261":{"dur":5,"text":"in a wild state, maintains \n what we call a geographic range."},"266":{"dur":2,"text":"In the case of this grizzly bear,"},"268":{"dur":4,"text":"this purple range is its entire \n distribution in North America."},"272":{"dur":2,"text":"What you'll note \n is that different grizzlies"},"275":{"dur":3,"text":"from different parts of the range look \n differently, there are different"},"278":{"dur":2,"text":"colors to them, \n they have different sizes,"},"280":{"dur":1,"text":"they actually hunt slightly differently."},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"Some of them are keyed \n on the salmon run,"},"285":{"dur":4,"text":"others go for bison calves \n during the bison calving season."},"290":{"dur":2,"text":"Notice the purple island"},"293":{"dur":3,"text":"to the far south \n of the rest of the range."},"296":{"dur":2,"text":"That island is the grizzly bear range,"},"299":{"dur":3,"text":"and grizzly bear populations \n in Yellowstone."},"303":{"dur":4,"text":"It's separate from the rest \n of the geographic range of this species."},"307":{"dur":4,"text":"So even though the ecosystem is really \n kind of intact and working, note"},"312":{"dur":5,"text":"that members of the species \n can't easily flow north and south."},"319":{"dur":2,"text":"There's also population variation."},"321":{"dur":3,"text":"So here what I've done \n is focus just on Yellowstone"},"325":{"dur":6,"text":"and each one of those green polygons \n is the home range of an individual bear."},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"All of these \n that I've shown are females."},"334":{"dur":1,"text":"Females generally have..."},"336":{"dur":5,"text":"in grizzly bears they have the most \n productive part of the ecosystem,"},"341":{"dur":3,"text":"they live in the valley \n where the vegetation is really good"},"344":{"dur":2,"text":"and where there are lots \n of large animals for them to eat,"},"347":{"dur":5,"text":"and the males then have slightly larger \n ranges that encompass many females."},"353":{"dur":3,"text":"So this population, these individuals"},"356":{"dur":5,"text":"forms the important kind of members \n of the Yellowstone ecosystem bears."},"362":{"dur":3,"text":"And then every individual \n in that ecosystem,"},"366":{"dur":4,"text":"indeed every individual \n of all the species across the range,"},"370":{"dur":3,"text":"has their own genetic diversity."},"373":{"dur":5,"text":"They have their own genotype composed \n of all of these kinds of... this DNA,"},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"and this turns out \n to be a very important part"},"381":{"dur":1,"text":"of biodiversity"},"382":{"dur":5,"text":"that's sometimes neglected when \n thinking about what biodiversity means."},"387":{"dur":3,"text":"I'll give you some examples \n about all of these levels,"},"391":{"dur":3,"text":"but just keep in mind \n that we can't forget any of them."},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"So all of them are important."},"398":{"dur":3,"text":"It's important... in fact, \n in Yellowstone"},"401":{"dur":1,"text":"all of the native animals,"},"403":{"dur":3,"text":"the animals that were there \n before it was established as a park"},"406":{"dur":3,"text":"are still present \n unlike the rest of America."},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"And part of the reason \n they're still present"},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"is because the wolves \n were reintroduced there."},"415":{"dur":4,"text":"So, work that I did in excavating \n paleontological sites in Yellowstone"},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"established \n that in fact wolves were native."},"422":{"dur":3,"text":"We went in there, \n we decimated every wolf"},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"at the turn of the century \n and all the way through the '20s,"},"429":{"dur":4,"text":"and then we established that in fact \n wolves really were native there,"},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"and they were reintroduced."},"435":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is an example \n of a positive conservation effort"},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"with the use of the fossil record."},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"So there are threats to biodiversity."},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"There are lots of threats."},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll detail \n some of the smaller versions,"},"448":{"dur":4,"text":"but basically the two big threats \n are climate change--"},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"we're headed for an uncertain,"},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"but very much warmer future--"},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"and ecosystem loss and transformation."},"461":{"dur":3,"text":"Both of these big, big forces \n on our planet"},"465":{"dur":3,"text":"are caused by human population growth."},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"The more humans we have..."},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"we have more and more every day \n on the planet."},"473":{"dur":5,"text":"Human population growth \n is influencing the temperature"},"478":{"dur":3,"text":"in our climate \n and the amount of ecosystems"},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"we're transforming for our own use."},"485":{"dur":4,"text":"We know that we can deliberately \n hunt animals to death."},"490":{"dur":5,"text":"We know that we are tied \n to extinctions directly."},"495":{"dur":4,"text":"So, from about 40,000 years \n ago to 10,000 years ago"},"500":{"dur":4,"text":"there was an event called \n the Late Pleistocene Extinction Event,"},"504":{"dur":5,"text":"and that extinction event is implicated \n as a combination of climate change,"},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"but most importantly human hunting."},"512":{"dur":4,"text":"This example is a menagerie of animals \n that used to live in North America"},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"prior to 10,000 years ago."},"519":{"dur":4,"text":"Giant extinct things like gomphotheres, \n which were related to elephants;"},"523":{"dur":1,"text":"mammoths, and mastodons;"},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"this big giant ground sloth;"},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"the dire wolf seen there,"},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"much larger than our present-day wolves;"},"532":{"dur":1,"text":"the saber tooth cat."},"534":{"dur":4,"text":"These animals used to live \n in North America, right around here."},"539":{"dur":1,"text":"We caused their extinction."},"541":{"dur":1,"text":"As a matter of fact,"},"542":{"dur":5,"text":"this extinction event focused \n specifically on large-bodied mammals."},"548":{"dur":6,"text":"About half of the world's what we call \n megafauna went extinct at that time."},"556":{"dur":5,"text":"So, one of the forces behind this is \n that human populations began to grow."},"562":{"dur":1,"text":"We got more and more innovative."},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"We were pretty good \n at developing and using our tools."},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"We got better as we evolved \n at communicating each other."},"570":{"dur":4,"text":"That communication allowed us \n to hunt better and more effectively."},"574":{"dur":4,"text":"Around 100,000 years ago, \n our ancestors, early modern humans,"},"579":{"dur":3,"text":"left Africa and colonized the globe."},"583":{"dur":4,"text":"In Africa they co-evolved \n with large animal species,"},"587":{"dur":1,"text":"and what you'll see in Africa here,"},"589":{"dur":3,"text":"this is the number of animal species \n on the Y axis,"},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"and their relative body size \n on the X axis."},"595":{"dur":1,"text":"So what you see are the survivors."},"597":{"dur":5,"text":"This histogram shows the numbers \n of species of survivors in yellow,"},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"and there's just a few little species"},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"that are in the large-bodied size \n category."},"608":{"dur":5,"text":"Large bodied here \n means over 44 kilograms or 100 pounds."},"613":{"dur":5,"text":"So things, just a few species larger \n than that size went extinct in Africa."},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"But humans continued \n to colonize the globe."},"621":{"dur":4,"text":"They next went to Australia, \n 40-60,000 years ago,"},"626":{"dur":1,"text":"and boom,"},"627":{"dur":6,"text":"this really unique Australian megafauna \n composed of all sorts of marsupials."},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"We saw the demise of giant kangaroos;"},"636":{"dur":3,"text":"we saw the demise of giant wallabies."},"639":{"dur":4,"text":"And those animals went extinct again \n around 40-60,000 years ago,"},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"when we arrived there."},"646":{"dur":3,"text":"We continued to expand into Europe, \n into Eastern Asia,"},"650":{"dur":6,"text":"and then by at least 35-15,000 years \n ago, humans made it to the Americas,"},"657":{"dur":3,"text":"across what was then at the time \n the Bering Land Bridge."},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is where we saw the loss \n of the big-bodied animals"},"664":{"dur":2,"text":"that I showed you on the previous slide."},"666":{"dur":5,"text":"A pretty large hit \n to the megafauna in North America."},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"And the same thing \n happened in South America."},"674":{"dur":6,"text":"Again, a large loss of virtually all the \n large-bodied animals in South America."},"680":{"dur":4,"text":"So we know we can hunt animals to death."},"685":{"dur":3,"text":"And let me remind you, \n this is early humans."},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"There were no guns."},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"They were hunting with spears."},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"Eventually they used bows and arrows."},"695":{"dur":4,"text":"These were primitive hunting techniques"},"699":{"dur":4,"text":"and yet they caused the extinction of \n many mammal species around the world."},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"We're a lot better at hunting now."},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"This is an AK-47,"},"710":{"dur":3,"text":"and I'll tell you now \n that there are large cartels"},"713":{"dur":5,"text":"of poachers that go out deliberately \n and kill animals for profit."},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"They trade \n in these body parts,"},"722":{"dur":4,"text":"and that is used to fuel all sorts \n of other nasty things,"},"726":{"dur":4,"text":"like drug running \n and human slave traffic."},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"We're much better at killing animals"},"734":{"dur":5,"text":"and it's not just the elephants \n and rhinos that are under extinction."},"739":{"dur":4,"text":"If we continue our hunting of elephants \n the way we are now,"},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"in 20 years there will be none left, \n except those in"},"747":{"dur":1,"text":"zoos."},"748":{"dur":1,"text":"In 20 years."},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"Remember, elephants \n live as long as we do."},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"Those individuals that we're culling"},"755":{"dur":3,"text":"are families that are being lost \n right before their eyes."},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll also point out about, \n for example, rhinos;"},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"we were just in Africa this summer."},"765":{"dur":6,"text":"The hunting of rhinos in Africa \n is so extreme that the only way"},"771":{"dur":8,"text":"to keep the rhino alive \n is that there's 24\/7 armed guards hiding"},"780":{"dur":1,"text":"in the bush"},"781":{"dur":5,"text":"around every individual rhino \n around Kruger National Park."},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"Unbelievable expense."},"788":{"dur":4,"text":"By the way, they are allowed \n to shoot to kill for poachers."},"793":{"dur":4,"text":"And the reason is because people \n want to come and see these rhinos"},"797":{"dur":5,"text":"and they're preventing the extinction \n of this animal before its time."},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's not just the elephants \n and rhinos."},"804":{"dur":1,"text":"Anybody know what this animal is?"},"807":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a pangolin."},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"So there are eight species \n of pangolin in the world."},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"Every one of them are threatened."},"814":{"dur":2,"text":"They live in Africa and Asia:"},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"four species in Africa, four in Asia."},"819":{"dur":1,"text":"They're mammals,"},"821":{"dur":3,"text":"but they have this really unusual \n scaly body."},"824":{"dur":4,"text":"That scaly body is something \n they use to protect themselves."},"829":{"dur":3,"text":"They have giant front feet, \n and if you look online,"},"833":{"dur":2,"text":"you should Google this \n and look for \"pangolins walking.\""},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"They walk kind of like little T-Rex's,"},"838":{"dur":4,"text":"they walk on their back two legs \n with their front feet up like this,"},"842":{"dur":1,"text":"they have massive claws,"},"844":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's what they use to get \n through the dirt"},"846":{"dur":1,"text":"and through termite mounds."},"848":{"dur":3,"text":"And when they're threatened \n they just curl up in a ball."},"852":{"dur":4,"text":"It turns out that that ball \n makes them really easy to poach."},"857":{"dur":1,"text":"Why?"},"858":{"dur":3,"text":"Because when they're threatened \n by humans, they curl up in a ball,"},"862":{"dur":1,"text":"the humans just pick them up and put"},"863":{"dur":1,"text":"them in a bag."},"865":{"dur":2,"text":"These can't be kept in captivity."},"867":{"dur":3,"text":"And so little is known about pangolins,"},"870":{"dur":4,"text":"but yet they're the most \n heavily trafficked animal in the world."},"875":{"dur":1,"text":"Every one of those eight"},"877":{"dur":2,"text":"species is headed for extinction."},"879":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's not just those big charismatic \n animals that are under threat."},"883":{"dur":3,"text":"It's small animals \n that we know so little about."},"887":{"dur":4,"text":"So humans are directly causing \n the extinction of animals."},"891":{"dur":3,"text":"It's not just guns that kill animals."},"894":{"dur":3,"text":"Now poachers in Africa \n have gotten very sophisticated."},"898":{"dur":1,"text":"They have a lot of \n money."},"899":{"dur":3,"text":"They fly over ponds, \n or sneak up to ponds,"},"903":{"dur":4,"text":"for example, watering holes \n where elephants will congregate."},"907":{"dur":3,"text":"They poison the watering hole."},"910":{"dur":4,"text":"Entire families decimated, \n and then after a few days,"},"915":{"dur":1,"text":"these poachers come,"},"916":{"dur":4,"text":"they take all the tusks \n and leave the bodies to rot in the sun."},"921":{"dur":4,"text":"There are 5,500 mammal species, \n a quarter of them are threatened."},"925":{"dur":4,"text":"We learned about what those kind \n of threatened categories are from Tony,"},"929":{"dur":1,"text":"most of them are threatened"},"931":{"dur":1,"text":"by habitat loss."},"932":{"dur":1,"text":"And what do we mean by that?"},"935":{"dur":2,"text":"So humans are causing habitat loss."},"937":{"dur":2,"text":"Why do we do this? \n We cut down forests like this."},"940":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, yeah, sure, we use the wood"},"943":{"dur":2,"text":"to make furniture \n and to build our houses."},"945":{"dur":2,"text":"But I'll tell you in places like India,"},"947":{"dur":2,"text":"there's not enough wood \n for any construction."},"951":{"dur":2,"text":"They don't build things out of wood \n anymore."},"953":{"dur":3,"text":"Wood is so valuable and hard to find,"},"957":{"dur":3,"text":"they're building their buildings \n out of brick."},"960":{"dur":2,"text":"Human population is another reason"},"963":{"dur":3,"text":"why deforestation is proceeding \n at such an incredible rate."},"966":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's another reason why poaching is \n proceeding at such an incredible rate."},"971":{"dur":2,"text":"Now I'm going to shift scales \n here as I go through these slides,"},"974":{"dur":3,"text":"but what we're doing \n is we're starting 10,000 years ago"},"978":{"dur":3,"text":"and we're moving to about the present \n or out 2,000 years ago."},"981":{"dur":2,"text":"So what we have here \n is the total world population"},"984":{"dur":2,"text":"of humans in millions of individuals."},"986":{"dur":1,"text":"And you can see that,"},"987":{"dur":3,"text":"and we could come all the way \n back to over 100,000 years"},"990":{"dur":1,"text":"as we were leaving Africa."},"992":{"dur":2,"text":"Human populations were really low,"},"995":{"dur":3,"text":"in the thousands to tens \n to hundreds of thousands of individuals."},"999":{"dur":4,"text":"And we started increasing our population \n dramatically."},"1004":{"dur":2,"text":"By the year 1500, right,"},"1006":{"dur":2,"text":"we had about 500 million people \n on the planet."},"1009":{"dur":5,"text":"Now keep your eye on that yellow dot \n because I've shifted scale now,"},"1015":{"dur":5,"text":"and this is a perspective of... that's \n the same 500 million people here,"},"1020":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's the year 1500."},"1023":{"dur":1,"text":"Here's where we are today."},"1025":{"dur":2,"text":"Exponential human growth."},"1029":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, the scary thing, \n and this is important."},"1032":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a touchy subject,"},"1033":{"dur":3,"text":"but it's really important \n for you to think about."},"1037":{"dur":3,"text":"If we brought our birthrates down..."},"1041":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll show you what they are in a second,"},"1043":{"dur":2,"text":"but instead of your mom and your dad,"},"1045":{"dur":3,"text":"for example having two children, \n on average,"},"1050":{"dur":2,"text":"we only had 1.5 on average..."},"1052":{"dur":2,"text":"it's not really possible \n to have a half a child."},"1056":{"dur":3,"text":"But on average, around the 7+ \n billion people on the planet."},"1060":{"dur":4,"text":"We could keep ourselves \n below eight billion people."},"1065":{"dur":3,"text":"We could keep ourselves \n about the same way it is today."},"1069":{"dur":5,"text":"If we only replaced ourselves \n by the year 2100"},"1074":{"dur":2,"text":"we'll have 10 billion people \n on the planet."},"1078":{"dur":3,"text":"If we just replace ourselves, i.e."},"1081":{"dur":1,"text":"every parent,"},"1083":{"dur":2,"text":"every couple has just two children."},"1087":{"dur":3,"text":"If we have just a half a child \n more than ourselves,"},"1091":{"dur":6,"text":"we'll be up almost to 14 billion people, \n around 13 billion people on the planet."},"1097":{"dur":1,"text":"And guess what?"},"1099":{"dur":5,"text":"If we continue our fertility rates \n the way they are right now,"},"1106":{"dur":3,"text":"27 billion people on the planet."},"1110":{"dur":1,"text":"That is not possible."},"1112":{"dur":1,"text":"It is not possible."},"1113":{"dur":4,"text":"So things will begin to happen \n to bring our birthrates down."},"1118":{"dur":1,"text":"And as a matter of fact,"},"1119":{"dur":4,"text":"birthrates are coming down almost \n everywhere in the world, just naturally."},"1123":{"dur":4,"text":"Some of the birthrates \n in places like Japan are close to zero."},"1128":{"dur":2,"text":"However... however,"},"1130":{"dur":3,"text":"our current fertility rates \n are still much too high."},"1135":{"dur":3,"text":"Let me give you this \n in a different perspective."},"1139":{"dur":4,"text":"So these are scaled exactly \n for our average body size,"},"1143":{"dur":2,"text":"around 100 pounds,"},"1146":{"dur":2,"text":"and the 7+ billion people on the planet."},"1148":{"dur":4,"text":"So I'm going to give you this \n in terms of biomass."},"1152":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is mammalian biomass."},"1156":{"dur":1,"text":"This is humans for scale."},"1159":{"dur":5,"text":"We have a lot of animals \n that we take around the world with us;"},"1164":{"dur":2,"text":"cows, sheep,"},"1166":{"dur":4,"text":"horses, pigs, rabbits, dogs, cats."},"1171":{"dur":1,"text":"Massive numbers."},"1173":{"dur":4,"text":"Actually, this impact in terms \n of biomass is larger than our
