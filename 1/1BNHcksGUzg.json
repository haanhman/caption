problems."},"558":{"dur":6,"text":"So we're now going to talk about a couple\nof the other issues that go with this."},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"You've heard a lot about Watson from IBM,\nI'm

to"},"585":{"dur":4,"text":"get the point across of why we do it differently\nand what is different."},"589":{"dur":6,"text":"A car, if you buy one today, thin end of the\nmarket, 150 sensing points on board."},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"Most of them about 200."},"598":{"dur":8,"text":"Move it up to the new Mercedes E or the BMW\n7, and you're up to round about 400, 450 points."},"607":{"dur":4,"text":"Plus of course the fact that they're connected\nnow to the internet."},"611":{"dur":3,"text":"It's now EU law that if we ship cars, they\nhave to have internet connectivity."},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"Did you know that?"},"619":{"dur":1,"text":"No?"},"620":{"dur":1,"text":"Fact."},"621":{"dur":3,"text":"So next time you're in the market for a car,\nallegedly that is one of the things we now"},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"look for."},"626":{"dur":5,"text":"So there's our car, and we're going to use\njust three sensors in it."},"631":{"dur":4,"text":"We're going to know what the tyre pressure\nis, whether it's occupied and being driven,"},"635":{"dur":2,"text":"and what speed."},"637":{"dur":5,"text":"From the three sensors, if we get a report\nfrom the sensor on tyre pressure that says"},"643":{"dur":5,"text":"the pressure's going down, we're not moving,\nand there's no one in the driver's seat."},"648":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a null event."},"649":{"dur":4,"text":"Until someone gets in the driver's seat and\nturns on the ignition, we don't want to know."},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"On the other hand, if we get the report that\nthe pressure is going down in the tyre very"},"658":{"dur":8,"text":"gently, and we're doing 30 miles an hour,\n45 kilometres an hour, the driver is going"},"666":{"dur":1,"text":"to get an alert."},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"They're going to get told they have a tyre\npressure dropping."},"670":{"dur":3,"text":"They'll probably be shown the tyre pressure,\net

different."},"683":{"dur":5,"text":"At that point, you'll start to do things like\npull the seat belt down, turn off the fuel"},"688":{"dur":3,"text":"supply in event of a crash, even adjust the\nbraking."},"691":{"dur":4,"text":"That's where the value comes out of IoT systems."},"696":{"dur":6,"text":"The ability to get an outcome from the sensors\nthat wouldn't have been present in a standard"},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"process."},"705":{"dur":4,"text":"And that means you can now see back how you\nwant to use data."},"709":{"dur":4,"text":"Now that's a very simplistic example I've\ngiven you, but it gets the point across that"},"713":{"dur":7,"text":"says we don't use data in a procedural way,\nwe have events that cause us to decide on"},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"a chain of reactions."},"723":{"dur":4,"text":"From that chain of reactions we want a data\nmodel."},"728":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's go into a slightly bigger picture."},"732":{"dur":7,"text":"I mentioned earlier that we have a slight\nproblem about people recognizing what's happening."},"740":{"dur":6,"text":"Really in our brave new world of IoT, there\nare two or three worlds actually colliding."},"746":{"dur":4,"text":"If we do this one around buildings for a moment,\nand we start with the picture of the building"},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"on one side and industrial automation."},"753":{"dur":5,"text":"Then that's a pretty well-developed science,\nso Johnson controls Honeywell or anybody else"},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"who does buildings."},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"They have systems which read and respond."},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"I always think of them as a reflex."},"767":{"dur":1,"text":"Temperature goes down, heating goes on."},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"Great."},"770":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, I've just said that we have a lot more\nways of now knowing what is that interaction?"},"774":{"dur":1,"text":"Why is it happening?"},"776":{"dur":7,"text":"But we also have this challenge that says\nwe need to do something about it."},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"We need to make something happen."},"785":{"dur":4,"text":"That's where we kick off smart services."},"790":{"dur":5,"text":"So Uber if you like, you're in the building\ntype situation."},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"You say something's happened."},"797":{"dur":4,"text":"Uber then picks up all those things, puts\nthem together, and decides what's the nearest"},"802":{"dur":3,"text":"car that meets your requirement?"},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"But they also have to do something else from\nthe far side."},"808":{"dur":2,"text":"They also have to process your credit card."},"811":{"dur":4,"text":"They also will take in feeds, so IBM will\ngive them the weather forecast."},"816":{"dur":4,"text":"They'll decide whether to jack the price up\nif it's raining.They'll pull in event data."},"821":{"dur":4,"text":"Something big's on, and therefore, they'll\nbe a bigger demand over there in this area,"},"825":{"dur":1,"text":"et cetera."},"826":{"dur":3,"text":"So what we've actually got now is something\nquite complicated because we've got three"},"830":{"dur":7,"text":"different time zones across which an activity\ncan happen, and quite clearly you'll recognize"},"837":{"dur":6,"text":"that we also have-- somewhere over on that\nside we have traditional big data analytics"},"843":{"dur":5,"text":"and traditional databases, but we don't want\nto use them in quite the way we did to support"},"849":{"dur":9,"text":"the middle zone of relatively real-time reaction\nand smart services in response to events and"},"858":{"dur":6,"text":"things that happen in the first [?]. So architecturally,\nIoT starts to introduce a very different set"},"865":{"dur":4,"text":"of architectures onto the kind of systems\nwe get."},"869":{"dur":4,"text":"And the assumption in that is, \"One architecture?"},"873":{"dur":3,"text":"Don't think so.\""},"876":{"dur":3,"text":"What's probably going to happen is a lot of\ndifferent service companies are going to be"},"880":{"dur":4,"text":"in the middle box, and a lot of different\nsources are going to be on the other side,"},"885":{"dur":1,"text":"et cetera."},"886":{"dur":4,"text":"So one of the challenges in this is, you might\nbe able to figure out a data model for your"},"890":{"dur":6,"text":"part of that, but it doesn't work very well\nbecause the reality is, as all the devices"},"897":{"dur":6,"text":"and the value is created by the interaction\nand the serendipitous capability that follows,"},"903":{"dur":5,"text":"you need to hold the data in a way that will\ngo with that."},"909":{"dur":4,"text":"Not very good to try and do it in conventional\nways."},"914":{"dur":6,"text":"So if we take that building and go a bit further,\nand start looking at what do you want to store?"},"921":{"dur":7,"text":"The picture here takes an air-conditioning\nunit, and there are five basic ways you can"},"928":{"dur":4,"text":"decide, \"I need to say something about this.\""},"932":{"dur":4,"text":"You can see the five up there - I don't know\nif you can read from the back location - description,"},"937":{"dur":6,"text":"so we need to know where it is in the building\nor physically out on a street."},"943":{"dur":1,"text":"We need a device description."},"945":{"dur":1,"text":"What model number is it?"},"946":{"dur":1,"text":"What type is it?"},"947":{"dur":2,"text":"For service purposes."},"950":{"dur":1,"text":"We need to know the customer."},"951":{"dur":1,"text":"Who is it we're working on?"},"953":{"dur":1,"text":"Who owns it?"},"954":{"dur":1,"text":"What do they do with it?"},"955":{"dur":6,"text":"The network it's attached to because many\nIoT networks are not traditional IT networks."},"961":{"dur":5,"text":"They'll be on something like ZigBee or something,\na low power network."},"967":{"dur":3,"text":"and you need to know if there's any permission\nabout who can have what."},"970":{"dur":3,"text":"So you have a series of dimensions again."},"973":{"dur":4,"text":"Very familiar, I would think to all of you,\nsince you're working in this area, but you"},"978":{"dur":7,"text":"can see how well now it fits us to create\na profile of a device in a way that now allows"},"986":{"dur":5,"text":"us to exploit the kind of dimensions you're\nused to experiencing."},"991":{"dur":5,"text":"So what happens when we get bigger and bigger?"},"996":{"dur":1,"text":"Why do we want this?"},"997":{"dur":2,"text":"What does it give us that's different?"},"1000":{"dur":6,"text":"It gives us a shift from what I will
