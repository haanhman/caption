process"},"511":{"dur":4,"text":"those prescription drugs."},"518":{"dur":1,"text":"The other thing that will be"},"519":{"dur":4,"text":"changing this year is\nthat we have had some cost"},"525":{"dur":3,"text":"increases in our premiums\nfor this next year,"},"528":{"dur":3,"text":"and that is something\nthat for those in the"},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"medicare carve-out plan we

the"},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"Medicare UI choice carve-out plan."},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"That will be going up 9% this year"},"549":{"dur":3,"text":"because we saw an increase in the claims."},"554":{"dur":3,"text":"Those premiums are based on the claims"},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"of the people in those groups."},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"So, with that change,\nwe will see an

person on campus,"},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"and certainly everybody\nin the benefits office"},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"is this time of year,\nand I'm asked why our"},"659":{"dur":4,"text":"UI choice plan

comprehensive plan"},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"but I'm not a commissioned\ninsurance salesperson"},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"so if you find an option that works"},"721":{"dur":3,"text":"better for you then

dollars"},"732":{"dur":1,"text":"a month in premiums by going"},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"with a different plan, but if they end up"},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"spending three hundred\ndollars a month more"},"738":{"dur":2,"text":"in out-of-pocket cost, they really"},"740":{"dur":1,"text":"haven't saved anything."},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I do encourage you to take a look at"},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"your anticipated spend and find out"},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"what might work best for you."},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"We certainly have people

it."},"852":{"dur":3,"text":"And, she's ready to come\nback and to UI choice,"},"856":{"dur":2,"text":"and the only thing I encouraged her to do"},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"is to call Wellmark customer

coming back."},"934":{"dur":2,"text":"One of the other\nadvantages, I think we have"},"937":{"dur":3,"text":"with offering this new\nplan is that it does allow"},"940":{"dur":3,"text":"spouses to make

referral."},"1608":{"dur":3,"text":"Now with the HMO plan, it really is more"},"1611":{"dur":2,"text":"of a situation where you work with a"},"1613":{"dur":2,"text":"primary care provider and they're going"},"1615":{"dur":1,"text":"to help coordinate your care."},"1617":{"dur":1,"text":"So, what that means for you is"},"1619":{"dur":1,"text":"your primary care provider would say,"},"1621":{"dur":1,"text":"you know I think you need to go see"},"1623":{"dur":2,"text":"a cardiologist maybe for your heart issue"},"1626":{"dur":2,"text":"and they're gonna help\nyou find a

purchase a plan on your own."},"1868":{"dur":2,"text":"And because those were so similar,"},"1870":{"dur":2,"text":"we wanted to kind of make a distinction"},"1873":{"dur":3,"text":"between the two,

2016."},"2083":{"dur":2,"text":"On the PPO plan, you would pay $50"},"2085":{"dur":2,"text":"and then ten percent."},"2088":{"dur":2,"text":"Urgent care, so if something

is"},"2557":{"dur":2,"text":"you can get a three month supply"},"2559":{"dur":2,"text":"of any of the tiers at Walmart or Sam's"},"2562":{"dur":2,"text":"and you just pay two

the book\nthat you would go to."},"2623":{"dur":1,"text":"You would look for your prescription."},"2624":{"dur":3,"text":"It's going to have the\ndrug tier next to it,"},"2628":{"dur":0,"text":"and then you could figure out"},"2629":{"dur":1,"text":"how much you would pay."},"2630":{"dur":2,"text":"Again, if you have a lot of prescriptions"},"2632":{"dur":2,"text":"and you wanna consider one of our plans,"},"2634":{"dur":1,"text":"it's really great if\nyou call health alliance"},"2636":{"dur":1,"text":"and let us walk through that with you,"},"2638":{"dur":2,"text":"and help you figure out your expenses"},"2640":{"dur":4,"text":"that you could potentially have in a year."},"2646":{"dur":1,"text":"So, the tier, that determines how much"},"2648":{"dur":1,"text":"you're gonna pay for the drug."},"2649":{"dur":1,"text":"And then, also, some of our drugs require"},"2651":{"dur":2,"text":"either prior authorization\nor step therapy,"},"2653":{"dur":1,"text":"and that means that you might have to try"},"2655":{"dur":3,"text":"another prescription first before"},"2658":{"dur":4,"text":"we would cover that prescription."},"2664":{"dur":1,"text":"There's a couple of things if you're

before you could"},"2689":{"dur":4,"text":"receive that under the\nhealth alliance plan."},"2694":{"dur":1,"text":"So, the plan does come with some extras,"},"2696":{"dur":1,"text":"and I talked about that before."},"2698":{"dur":1,"text":"That's one of the things that a"},"2699":{"dur":2,"text":"medicare advantage plan can offer."},"2701":{"dur":2,"text":"So, we have a supplemental benefit"},"2703":{"dur":1,"text":"this year that we're introducing,"},"2705":{"dur":3,"text":"and that's a hundred\ndollars for you to use"},"2708":{"dur":4,"text":"on vision, dental, or hearing services."},"2712":{"dur":4,"text":"So, on the HMO plan, we do not cover"},"2717":{"dur":3,"text":"a routine eye exam, but if it's your year"},"2720":{"dur":1,"text":"to have a routine eye exam, you could use"},"2722":{"dur":2,"text":"this hundred dollars\ntowards that coverage."},"2725":{"dur":2,"text":"If it's not your year to\nhave a routine eye exam,"},"2727":{"dur":1,"text":"you could use this hundred dollars towards"},"2729":{"dur":3,"text":"a new pair of glasses,\nnew pair of contacts,"},"2733":{"dur":4,"text":"or a hearing exam, or a dental cleaning,"},"2737":{"dur":1,"text":"or maybe you need to\nhave some dental work,"},"2739":{"dur":2,"text":"you could use that hundred\ndollars towards that."},"2741":{"dur":2,"text":"Basically, you go and\nyou have your service."},"2744":{"dur":3,"text":"If your dentist or your\nvision provider bills"},"2747":{"dur":2,"text":"health alliance, then we\nwould process that claim"},"2750":{"dur":2,"text":"and reimburse you up to a hundred dollars."},"2752":{"dur":1,"text":"If they're not willing\nto bill health alliance,"},"2754":{"dur":3,"text":"then you would just ask them for your bill"},"2758":{"dur":1,"text":"and you would turn that\ninto health alliance"},"2759":{"dur":2,"text":"and we would reimburse you."},"2761":{"dur":4,"text":"That benefit is on both the\nHMO plan and the PPO plan."},"2766":{"dur":3,"text":"The PPO plan does have a routine eye exam"},"2770":{"dur":2,"text":"that's covered at a\nfive dollar co-payment,"},"2772":{"dur":1,"text":"but you could still\nuse that hundred dollar"},"2774":{"dur":3,"text":"benefit for glasses or a dental cleaning,"},"2778":{"dur":3,"text":"or a hearing exam, those types of things."},"2782":{"dur":2,"text":"So, another thing is, if you choose the"},"2784":{"dur":3,"text":"dental coverage through the university,"},"2788":{"dur":3,"text":"and maybe you have a filling done"},"2791":{"dur":1,"text":"and you have some costs associated"},"2793":{"dur":1,"text":"with that filling, you could turn"},"2794":{"dur":2,"text":"that in and use that\nhundred dollar benefit."},"2796":{"dur":1,"text":"So, we've really designed that to give you"},"2798":{"dur":2,"text":"a little bit of extra\ncoverage for some of those"},"2800":{"dur":3,"text":"types of services to help you with those."},"2804":{"dur":1,"text":"So, we have the Silver\nSneakers fitness program"},"2806":{"dur":3,"text":"and this is where you\nhave free gym memberships"},"2809":{"dur":3,"text":"to several of the local gyms in the area."},"2813":{"dur":1,"text":"You can participate in classes,"},"2815":{"dur":2,"text":"and they also have some at-home programs."},"2817":{"dur":2,"text":"So, if you don't feel\ncomfortable going to a gym"},"2820":{"dur":1,"text":"or it's winter time and you don't wanna"},"2821":{"dur":2,"text":"leave the house, they\nhave some programs that"},"2823":{"dur":4,"text":"you can call and order\nand do right in your home."},"2828":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, we also have Assist America"},"2830":{"dur":3,"text":"and this is a travel assistance program."},"2833":{"dur":2,"text":"This is

country"},"2841":{"dur":1,"text":"and something happens to you,"},"2843":{"dur":2,"text":"but it is a travel assistance program"},"2845":{"dur":1,"text":"that can help you find your

emergency situation"},"2854":{"dur":2,"text":"where you need to pick up a prescription."},"2857":{"dur":2,"text":"It can also help you if something very bad"},"2860":{"dur":2,"text":"happens to you

your own,"},"2870":{"dur":2,"text":"it can provide some services like that."},"2872":{"dur":1,"text":"So, it's a really great benefit."},"2873":{"dur":2,"text":"It really has a lot of different things"},"2875":{"dur":2,"text":"that it can provide you if you are a"},"2877":{"dur":4,"text":"person that likes to travel."},"2882":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I wanna talk a little bit about"},"2884":{"dur":2,"text":"some protections that\nyou get with our plan."},"2886":{"dur":2,"text":"So, if you have something that happens"},"2889":{"dur":2,"text":"and you don't like the decision that"},"2891":{"dur":1,"text":"health alliance has made,"},"2893":{"dur":3,"text":"you have the ability to\nappeal that decision."},"2896":{"dur":2,"text":"And that means that\nyou can call us and say"},"2898":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that my service\nshould have been covered,"},"2900":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't agree with your decision,"},"2903":{"dur":3,"text":"and we would have to\nhave an

action."},"2927":{"dur":2,"text":"You also have the ability\nto file a grievance."},"2930":{"dur":2,"text":"So, if there's anything\nthat happens with your plan,"},"2932":{"dur":1,"text":"you find one
