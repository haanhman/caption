this\nreally amazing research"},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"that's been around for a\nwhile, but for some reason,"},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"it hasn't been\ndisseminated as widely"},"487":{"dur":6,"text":"as

Ace Study,"},"499":{"dur":3,"text":"where it's for the Adverse\nChildhood Experiences test."},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"And it talks about the different\ntraumas or major stresses"},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"that people have\nhad in their life."},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you've had adverse\nexperiences, whether that's"},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"a real kind of capital\nT

that's often in\nthe schools around"},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"here, where there's\nthis incredible push"},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"and stress for kids to achieve."},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you're growing up\nwith all of these stressors,"},"529":{"dur":3,"text":"I'll just read a few of the\nthings that it predicts."},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"So one of the first\namazing things"},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"is, if you have a lot of\nthese very intense stressors,"},"538":{"dur":5,"text":"traumas, your life\nexpectancy is 20 years less,"},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"which is rather amazing."},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"People with high ACE\nscores are three times as"},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"likely to experience\nacademic failure,"},"552":{"dur":3,"text":"six times as likely to have\nbehavioral problems, and five"},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"times as likely to have\nattendance problems."},"558":{"dur":4,"text":"So we set up kids in a very\ndisturbing environment,"},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"and their brain architecture\nthat we're really"},"565":{"dur":3,"text":"finding that the architecture\nof the brain, even the genetics,"},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"is changed by stress levels."},"571":{"dur":3,"text":"Even more amazingly,\nmore recent research"},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"is finding that the\nlevels of stress"},"577":{"dur":5,"text":"can change the genetics which\ngets passed on to their kids."},"582":{"dur":4,"text":"So there's these high\nlevels of trauma and stress,"},"587":{"dur":3,"text":"whether that's-- I work a lot\nin-- one day I'll be in like"},"590":{"dur":3,"text":"a Berkeley, very\nprivileged school,"},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'll see the intent\nstressors that these kids are"},"596":{"dur":1,"text":"under to achieve."},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"And then the next day, I'll\nbe in an inner city Oakland"},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"school, with very different\ntypes of stressors,"},"602":{"dur":1,"text":"but all stressors."},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"And this stress physically\naffects the body"},"606":{"dur":4,"text":"and really hijacks the mind\nto be able to be present"},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"and to think and to be creative."},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"So all of the\ntesting that we throw"},"614":{"dur":3,"text":"on our kids, all of this really\nintense high stakes testing,"},"618":{"dur":4,"text":"actually dumbs the mind down."},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"It puts people in even\nmore of a kind of fight"},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"or flight or a freeze response."},"628":{"dur":3,"text":"So, such a big part of\nthe mindfulness training,"},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"that I do, the emotional\nintelligence training,"},"634":{"dur":1,"text":"is first, how do\nwe get kids to feel"},"635":{"dur":6,"text":"comfortable and relaxed and\npresent in their bodies."},"642":{"dur":5,"text":"So one of the big things I've\nalso been tracking recently,"},"648":{"dur":3,"text":"is you probably also\nthe news around New York"},"651":{"dur":3,"text":"and a lot of the other states\nthat opted out of tests."},"655":{"dur":4,"text":"So 175,000 students\nin New York opted out"},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"of the standardized testing."},"661":{"dur":4,"text":"In some places it was 70% of\nthe entire school district,"},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"the kids said, we're\nnot taking these tests."},"668":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's a big shift\nhappening in education."},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"I recently had somebody\nfrom Silicon Valley who's"},"674":{"dur":3,"text":"trying to start a school,\nand he came to me and said,"},"677":{"dur":1,"text":"I want to create this school."},"679":{"dur":1,"text":"I consult with a lot\nof different schools,"},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"bringing in mindfulness\nand emotional intelligence"},"683":{"dur":1,"text":"around the world."},"685":{"dur":2,"text":"But what was particularly\namazing for me"},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"about what this\ngentleman was bringing"},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"was that he was\nsaying, that they're"},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"going to bring a lot of\nwhat you all at Google"},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"are developing\namazingly, they're"},"698":{"dur":4,"text":"bringing all of the tech in\ninformation, kind of Khan"},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"Academy style information."},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"So all the information\nthat's going to be delivered"},"707":{"dur":3,"text":"is going to be from the great\nscientists and professors"},"710":{"dur":3,"text":"from the great institutions\naround the world."},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"And what that does is,\nit completely frees up"},"716":{"dur":0,"text":"the teachers."},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"They're no longer\ninformation purveyors."},"720":{"dur":2,"text":"And what they are becoming\nnow in this school"},"722":{"dur":5,"text":"that I'm consulting with,\nwhat they are going to become"},"727":{"dur":4,"text":"is emotional\nintelligence, mindfulness,"},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"kind of helping the kids\nfind meaning, helping"},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"them be creative, helping\nthem find their path in life."},"738":{"dur":2,"text":"Helping them understand how to\naccess knowledge, helping them"},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"understand to be their\nbest people, which"},"744":{"dur":1,"text":"is an amazing shift."},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"Because so many teachers\nthat I talk with,"},"747":{"dur":1,"text":"tell me that about\nhalf of their time"},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"anyway is basically\nas a social worker,"},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"trying to get their kids\nto stop moving around."},"755":{"dur":1,"text":"They have so much ADHD."},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"There's so much disregulation."},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"I could explain the numbers\nof the anxiety and depression"},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"that's like going through\nthe roof with kids"},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"as young as like kindergarten."},"767":{"dur":3,"text":"Kids are getting diagnoses at\nthese incredibly young ages."},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"So for the teachers\nto actually be there"},"772":{"dur":2,"text":"as these holistic\nsupport systems,"},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"and then to be able to give\nthem all of this information"},"778":{"dur":1,"text":"that's readily accessible."},"780":{"dur":4,"text":"So what I want to do is to\nwalk through what mindfulness"},"785":{"dur":3,"text":"and what's called social,\nemotional learning, some fun"},"789":{"dur":3,"text":"ways that it's offered, and\nwhat it actually can do."},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's five\ndifferent realms that I"},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"look at of different\ntypes of literacy,"},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"not just what Common\nCore does, which"},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"is just kind of\nmath and language,"},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"but five deeper\nrealms of literacy."},"804":{"dur":2,"text":"Which are the literacy\nof our bodies,"},"807":{"dur":5,"text":"the literacy of our minds,\nliteracy of our hearts,"},"813":{"dur":3,"text":"literacy around\nthe social world,"},"816":{"dur":3,"text":"and then literacy around\nkind of our ecology,"},"820":{"dur":3,"text":"our understanding of our\nplace in nature and the world."},"823":{"dur":3,"text":"So we can start with the\nliteracy of our bodies."},"826":{"dur":1,"text":"I just did a little bit\nwith you around just"},"828":{"dur":1,"text":"those Spiderman breaths."},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"That's us learning how\nto be in touch, relaxed,"},"832":{"dur":2,"text":"connected to our bodies."},"835":{"dur":1,"text":"Adam was telling\nme before about how"},"836":{"dur":5,"text":"he does some work with veterans\nwho are returning from war."},"841":{"dur":3,"text":"He said he starts by doing\nthese great like rafting trips"},"845":{"dur":2,"text":"and fun things with them,\ngetting them in their body"},"848":{"dur":3,"text":"and teaching them about\nmindfulness through getting"},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"into the flow, getting\nconnected to what's alive"},"855":{"dur":1,"text":"So there's all these\ndifferent access points."},"857":{"dur":1,"text":"So I start with\nkids, if their minds"},"859":{"dur":1,"text":"are hijacked, which\nso many of them"},"861":{"dur":4,"text":"are, how do we help them drop\ninto their bodies to integrate?"},"865":{"dur":2,"text":"So the first thing--\nand I'll walk us"},"867":{"dur":3,"text":"all through some exercises\nto be experiential."},"871":{"dur":3,"text":"If everybody just\nputs up one hand."},"874":{"dur":2,"text":"And why don't we look\nat it for a moment,"},"877":{"dur":4,"text":"just kind of explore this hand\nthat's always typing and doing"},"882":{"dur":1,"text":"everything for you."},"883":{"dur":1,"text":"But you probably\nhaven't actually"},"885":{"dur":2,"text":"taken a look at all the\nlittle lines and colors in it."},"890":{"dur":2,"text":"And then you could\nlet your eyes close."},"893":{"dur":2,"text":"And since your eyes\nare closed, how"},"895":{"dur":3,"text":"do you know that\nyour hand is there?"},"899":{"dur":3,"text":"What are the physical sensations\nthat you can feel in there?"},"905":{"dur":2,"text":"And maybe why don't you\nfeel the other hand,"},"908":{"dur":2,"text":"see what's sensations\nare in the other hand."},"910":{"dur":0,"text":"Are they different?"},"911":{"dur":2,"text":"Are they the same?"},"913":{"dur":3,"text":"The fingers, the palm, see if\nyou can get really interested."},"920":{"dur":4,"text":"And how about feeling both\nhands at the same time?"},"924":{"dur":1,"text":"OK."},"926":{"dur":2,"text":"Thank you for\nplaying that with me."},"928":{"dur":2,"text":"So, often with kids\nwhat I'll do is"},"930":{"dur":3,"text":"a really give them a language\nfor their physical experience."},"933":{"dur":1,"text":"We'll go through\nour bodies, maybe"},"935":{"dur":2,"text":"we'll pick something\nup and do, you"},"937":{"dur":4,"text":"know, write with a\npencil in slow motion,"},"942":{"dur":2,"text":"feeling the way the\nhand moves, doing"},"944":{"dur":1,"text":"different types of\nslow motion movements,"},"946":{"dur":2,"text":"really learning the sensations."},"948":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll go up on the blackboard\nand have kids say,"},"950":{"dur":2,"text":"what you feel in your body."},"952":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'll show you as we go\nthrough the mind, the heart,"},"955":{"dur":3,"text":"why we need to start with this\nkind of physical literacy,"},"959":{"dur":3,"text":"understanding how the\nbody feels, how it moves,"},"962":{"dur":2,"text":"what it means to be relaxed,\nwhat it means to be stressed."},"965":{"dur":2,"text":"Teaching kids where stress is\nin the body and what it feels"},"968":{"dur":0,"text":"like."},"969":{"dur":5,"text":"So really giving them this\nlanguage of the physical body."},"974":{"dur":4,"text":"Then I move on, once the kids\nare relaxed, they're present,"},"978":{"dur":3,"text":"I move on to some mind training."},"981":{"dur":2,"text":"So teaching them how to,\nwhat we talk a lot about,"},"984":{"dur":3,"text":"as building the\nmuscles of attention."},"987":{"dur":3,"text":"And there's something about\nthis attention practice"},"991":{"dur":2,"text":"that I'm sure all of\nyou-- and still in schools"},"993":{"dur":1,"text":"I hear over and\nover again, teachers"},"995":{"dur":4,"text":"yelling at kids to pay attention\nor not to be distracted."},"999":{"dur":2,"text":"But we don't teach them\nhow to pay attention"},"1001":{"dur":2,"text":"or how not to get\ndistracted or how"},"1003":{"dur":2,"text":"to be calm, how to be\nrelaxed in their body."},"1006":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's really\nprecise, clear ways"},"1009":{"dur":2,"text":"to develop this\nsense of attention."},"1011":{"dur":3,"text":"One of the ways that kids seem\nto really love exploring it"},"1015":{"dur":2,"text":"is a game that I call\nthe distraction game."},"1017":{"dur":2,"text":"So I'll go into a classroom\nand I'll teach kids"},"1019":{"dur":3,"text":"how to take their hands and\nput them on their bellies"},"1023":{"dur":2,"text":"and just to feel their\nbreath moving in and out."},"1028":{"dur":2,"text":"And then what I'll do\nis, I will walk around,"},"1031":{"dur":2,"text":"and usually most\nschools I'm in, there's"},"1034":{"dur":2,"text":"lots of like pencil\njars and things"},"1036":{"dur":1,"text":"you can make noises with."},"1038":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'll say, who thinks they\ncan be totally focused, even"},"1041":{"dur":1,"text":"if I try to distract them?"},"1043":{"dur":2,"text":"And kids really like this, and\nso they'll put up their hands."},"1045":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'll go around\nand I'll start"},"1047":{"dur":2,"text":"making noises and\nopening the

two"},"2625":{"dur":0,"text":"really important ones."},"2626":{"dur":4,"text":"So first one is, sometimes\nyou get really lucky"},"2631":{"dur":3,"text":"and you have an\nadministrator who's already"},"2634":{"dur":1,"text":"into mindfulness or something."},"2635":{"dur":1,"text":"And of course, that's great."},"2636":{"dur":2,"text":"This needs to be systemic,\nbecause the stress
