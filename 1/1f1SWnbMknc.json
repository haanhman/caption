organization."},"85":{"dur":2,"text":"We have approximately\n60 people who"},"87":{"dur":5,"text":"are focusing on this\nparticular subject area."},"93":{"dur":3,"text":"We do most of the work for\nsystem health management"},"96":{"dur":3,"text":"for NASA, or at least we\nare the lead organization."},"100":{"dur":5,"text":"And it is mostly low to mid\ntechnology readiness level."},"105":{"dur":4,"text":"We divide the maturity\nof the technology"},"110":{"dur":4,"text":"from one to nine in different\nstages, and one to seven"},"114":{"dur":4,"text":"means anything from\nconception to prototyping,"},"118":{"dur":2,"text":"and then we leave the\nrest to somebody else"},"121":{"dur":5,"text":"to implement and actually\nuse it in a mission context."},"127":{"dur":5,"text":"So what we do mostly is provide\na state assessment of systems."},"132":{"dur":4,"text":"And that includes\ntechnology elements"},"137":{"dur":4,"text":"such as data mining, failure\nprediction, fault diagnosis,"},"141":{"dur":2,"text":"decisioning, physics based\nmodeling, and quantum"},"144":{"dur":0,"text":"computing."},"145":{"dur":4,"text":"So that's all stuff that\nwe deal with in DASH,"},"149":{"dur":2,"text":"which stands for Discovery\nAnd Systems Health."},"152":{"dur":3,"text":"And the overall ideas is to\nenable resilience of systems,"},"156":{"dur":3,"text":"and to mitigate off-nominal\nkind of conditions."},"163":{"dur":7,"text":"I'd like to start out with a\ndefinition on the next slides."},"170":{"dur":5,"text":"Then I'll be talking about why\nwe care if or whether something"},"175":{"dur":3,"text":"breaks, and then\ntalk a little bit"},"179":{"dur":4,"text":"about how one would go\nabout dealing with that,"},"183":{"dur":5,"text":"perhaps preventing it, perhaps\nwith mitigating something"},"189":{"dur":2,"text":"that has already been broken."},"191":{"dur":4,"text":"And then I'll give a few\nexamples from the NASA context."},"197":{"dur":2,"text":"So systems health\nmanagement, it's"},"200":{"dur":4,"text":"the capability to contain,\nprevent, detect, diagnose,"},"204":{"dur":3,"text":"predict, respond to, and\nrecover from conditions"},"207":{"dur":3,"text":"that may interfere with\nnominal system operations."},"210":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's a thing."},"212":{"dur":3,"text":"What it means is we\nare monitoring stuff,"},"215":{"dur":5,"text":"and if there are any kind\nof deviations from how"},"221":{"dur":5,"text":"the system should operate then\nwe want to recognize that,"},"227":{"dur":2,"text":"and we want to do\nsomething about it."},"232":{"dur":2,"text":"Why do we care if\nsomething breaks?"},"234":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, when we build, or buy,\nor operate stuff, by stuff"},"240":{"dur":4,"text":"I really mean equipment,\nthen there is an expectation"},"244":{"dur":3,"text":"that it should last\nfor a little while."},"248":{"dur":3,"text":"So nobody wants to spend a few\nhundred dollars on something,"},"251":{"dur":1,"text":"or a few thousand,\nor a few million"},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"on something that\nimmediately breaks."},"255":{"dur":4,"text":"And oftentimes things\ndo last a long time."},"259":{"dur":3,"text":"Sometimes they last even\nlonger than we expect."},"263":{"dur":4,"text":"Example might be this\nfarming equipment."},"267":{"dur":2,"text":"That thing probably\nis 60 or 70 years old,"},"270":{"dur":2,"text":"and farmers are still\nusing it in the field."},"272":{"dur":4,"text":"And these are extremely\nrugged, and robust, and last"},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"for a long time."},"278":{"dur":3,"text":"Sometimes things do not last."},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"And an example might be here."},"285":{"dur":3,"text":"This Aloha flight\nthat about 30 years"},"288":{"dur":7,"text":"ago or so had an unfortunate\nmishap where part of a fuselage"},"296":{"dur":3,"text":"simply broke off in mid flight."},"299":{"dur":1,"text":"It just flew off."},"301":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is a good\nargument for always staying"},"305":{"dur":2,"text":"buckled in your seats."},"307":{"dur":1,"text":"Unfortunately a few\npeople were not,"},"309":{"dur":2,"text":"so there were a few casualties."},"311":{"dur":0,"text":"That's bad."},"312":{"dur":3,"text":"But this is a clear\nexample of where you really"},"315":{"dur":3,"text":"expect the equipment\nto function,"},"319":{"dur":5,"text":"and then you are somewhat\nunpleasantly surprised"},"324":{"dur":1,"text":"if it does not."},"326":{"dur":4,"text":"Obviously we have lots of other\nexamples where things break"},"330":{"dur":4,"text":"that cause inconveniences,\nor that cause even worse,"},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"loss of life."},"338":{"dur":0,"text":"Everybody has a car."},"339":{"dur":2,"text":"And we have an expectation\nthat we can drive to work,"},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"that it doesn't break\ndown, but we all"},"344":{"dur":5,"text":"know that they can break down."},"349":{"dur":5,"text":"So we do have somewhat\nof a throwaway mentality."},"355":{"dur":0,"text":"Right?"},"356":{"dur":4,"text":"We use something and\nthen we stuff it away."},"360":{"dur":4,"text":"But some things don't\nreally fit too well"},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"into that kind of mindset."},"367":{"dur":3,"text":"We are expecting that\nfor certain safety"},"371":{"dur":4,"text":"relevant equipment that\nit actually works well."},"376":{"dur":3,"text":"So, in particular, I gave\nan example on the slide"},"379":{"dur":3,"text":"before for transportation\nsystems such as airplanes"},"383":{"dur":1,"text":"you really have the\nexpectation that if you"},"385":{"dur":4,"text":"get in there that it gets\nyou safely to the other side,"},"389":{"dur":1,"text":"to the next airport."},"391":{"dur":4,"text":"Similarly with cars, or trains,\nor ships, or, in our context,"},"396":{"dur":1,"text":"rockets."},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you fly a\nrocket you really"},"399":{"dur":2,"text":"don't want that\nthing to blow up."},"402":{"dur":4,"text":"In particular, something\nof concern for astronauts"},"407":{"dur":3,"text":"who might be sitting\non there, they"},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"have an expectation that that\nthing will work reliably."},"416":{"dur":0,"text":"Power."},"417":{"dur":1,"text":"Nuclear power plants."},"418":{"dur":3,"text":"We have an expectation\nthat those things are safe,"},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"and that they work, and\nthat there are no accidents"},"424":{"dur":5,"text":"or malfunctions that cause\nadverse kind of conditions."},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"These have happened\nin the past of course."},"432":{"dur":2,"text":"We remember Three Mile Island."},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"We also remember Fukushima."},"436":{"dur":3,"text":"If that kind of\nequipment malfunctions"},"439":{"dur":4,"text":"there's quickly large\nscale kind of consequences,"},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"and we want to avoid that."},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"Medical equipment."},"449":{"dur":4,"text":"If you are getting into the\nhospital with an emergency"},"453":{"dur":4,"text":"condition you really want the\nCT scanner to work, or the MRI."},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"You don't want that thing\nto break down right then"},"460":{"dur":0,"text":"and there."},"461":{"dur":4,"text":"So you really need that to work."},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"Another motivation\nbesides safety"},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"might be that it is\nexpensive either to replace"},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"or to operate."},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"Again, in the\ncontext of power you"},"474":{"dur":3,"text":"have these large\nstationary gas turbines."},"477":{"dur":1,"text":"These are huge."},"479":{"dur":3,"text":"They could be maybe 30 meter\nin diameter or something"},"482":{"dur":0,"text":"like that."},"483":{"dur":5,"text":"And if that breaks down\nyou cannot operate it."},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"So the operators are very\nunhappy because it costs them"},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"a lot of money, because they\noperate on very thin margins."},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"And it costs a lot\nof time to repair it,"},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"because if you have to\ncrack open a gas turbine"},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"and get to the blade\nthat has a crack"},"502":{"dur":1,"text":"or something like\nthat this is a very"},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"expensive kind of undertaking."},"507":{"dur":4,"text":"Similarly with\nwind turbines they"},"511":{"dur":6,"text":"are oftentimes in very remote\nplaces, and they are very tall,"},"518":{"dur":1,"text":"and they're very hard to get to."},"519":{"dur":9,"text":"And if they fail that costs\nyou money for one to repair,"},"528":{"dur":3,"text":"but also because you're\nnot operating it, and not"},"531":{"dur":3,"text":"getting revenue from the\npower that you're generating."},"535":{"dur":4,"text":"Oil and gas, similarly\npipelines, drill rigs,"},"540":{"dur":4,"text":"mining operations, these are\nall kind of expensive operations"},"544":{"dur":2,"text":"where you want stuff\nto really work."},"546":{"dur":6,"text":"IT data server farms, I have\na picture here, networks."},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"You want those\nthings to operate."},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"And that may be something that\nyou're more interested in."},"559":{"dur":6,"text":"You can't really\naccommodate the fact"},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"that the whole thing goes\ndown due to the cooling system"},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"breaking, or\nsomething like that."},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"Manufacturing."},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"You might have robotic\nequipment or machinery."},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"Everything is automated."},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"And it costs you money if\nthat stuff breaks down, again,"},"583":{"dur":4,"text":"to repair, and also from loss\nof revenue that it's generating."},"588":{"dur":3,"text":"Security critical\nequipment in buildings,"},"591":{"dur":3,"text":"residential or\ncommercial, you want"},"595":{"dur":6,"text":"to make sure that the security\nsystems work properly,"},"602":{"dur":6,"text":"that it monitors your house,\nthat it monitors your property."},"609":{"dur":5,"text":"And if that breaks\nthat's bad as well."},"614":{"dur":5,"text":"So NASA cares about that in\nthe context of crew decision"},"619":{"dur":3,"text":"support in emergency situations."},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"Again, you know, if you are\nsitting on top of a rocket"},"627":{"dur":3,"text":"and you're ready for\nblast off, and you"},"630":{"dur":5,"text":"get an indication that there\nmight be something wrong"},"636":{"dur":4,"text":"then you have to be pretty sure\nto either call off the launch,"},"641":{"dur":7,"text":"or if it has already launched\nto eject the astronauts."},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"And then there's a\nvery subtle trade"},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"off between the false positives\nand the false negatives."},"653":{"dur":4,"text":"Right, so a false positive is if\nyou're crying wolf and nothing"},"658":{"dur":5,"text":"actually is wrong that's\na really black eye,"},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"because you're\nejecting the pilots,"},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"and you blow up, you\nknow, $400 million."},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"And that doesn't look good."},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"However, false\nnegatives are very"},"675":{"dur":3,"text":"unpopular with the astronauts."},"678":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's mathematically\nnot possible to really get"},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"both the false positives\nand the false negatives,"},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"the likelihood of\nboth, down to 0."},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"So you have to find\nsome sort of trade off,"},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"and the negotiations of\nwhere that set point is,"},"692":{"dur":3,"text":"is a very interesting\none between the operators"},"695":{"dur":1,"text":"and the astronauts."},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"You also want to ensure\nmission completion."},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"You want to make sure\nthat crew can come back,"},"706":{"dur":3,"text":"but also if you have\nsatellites that are oftentimes"},"710":{"dur":3,"text":"very expensive, hundreds\nof millions of dollars,"},"714":{"dur":5,"text":"you can't really afford\nto put that into space,"},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"and then it just doesn't\ndo anything there simply"},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"because something breaks\nthat you didn't anticipate"},"725":{"dur":1,"text":"or that you didn't recognize."},"730":{"dur":4,"text":"NASA also cares about\ncost, increasingly so."},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"There's an environment\nwhere cost containment"},"737":{"dur":3,"text":"is a big topic."},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"So for life cycle\nmanagement one is"},"743":{"dur":3,"text":"concerned about life\nextension to avoid"},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"unscheduled maintenance,\nto increase uptime,"},"750":{"dur":6,"text":"to increase launch availability,\nto make informed decisions"},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"whether to go or\ncancel an operation,"},"760":{"dur":5,"text":"and in general to reduce risk\nwith the support of go or no-go"},"765":{"dur":0,"text":"decisions."},"766":{"dur":3,"text":"And what you see\nis the launch pad"},"769":{"dur":2,"text":"where the shuttle\nused to launch."},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"And these are fairly\ncomplex kind of beasts."},"775":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's not just that you put a\nrocket somewhere on the ground,"},"779":{"dur":3,"text":"and light a fuse, and\neverything goes up."},"783":{"dur":4,"text":"These are incredibly\ncomplex constructs"},"787":{"dur":4,"text":"that have to work just like\nany other complex machinery."},"792":{"dur":1,"text":"And ultimately you\ncan use it also"},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"for design improvement where\nyou feed back the information"},"796":{"dur":5,"text":"about the operation, and also\nabout the abnormal behavior"},"802":{"dur":0,"text":"into the design."},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"Here are some\nexamples where things"},"810":{"dur":4,"text":"didn't go quite as\nplanned from NASA."},"814":{"dur":3,"text":"So you see a lot\nof satellites here."},"817":{"dur":5,"text":"Most of them, there's a few\nhere that we think are on Mars,"},"823":{"dur":6,"text":"but we're not quite sure because\nwe lost contact and essentially"},"829":{"dur":3,"text":"never were able\nto recover those."},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"There's a few like this\none that had a malfunction,"},"836":{"dur":4,"text":"and then turned into\nso-called \"fail-safe\" mode."},"841":{"dur":3,"text":"But the fail-safe mode\nwas such that the battery"},"844":{"dur":3,"text":"was pointed towards the sun,\nwhich then proceeded to cook."},"848":{"dur":4,"text":"And then once the battery\nis cooked the thing is dead."},"852":{"dur":3,"text":"Apollo 13, we all know\nabout the mishap there,"},"856":{"dur":3,"text":"and then the space shuttle\nalso had a few accidents"},"860":{"dur":1,"text":"that we all remember."},"865":{"dur":2,"text":"So what can one\nactually do about it?"},"867":{"dur":0,"text":"Yes."},"868":{"dur":1,"text":"You have a question."},"869":{"dur":2,"text":"AUDIENCE: So what are the common\nfailures, the common types"},"872":{"dur":2,"text":"of faults that cause\nthose failures?"},"875":{"dur":1,"text":"The fault modes?"},"877":{"dur":5,"text":"KAI GOEBEL: Well, there are\nvery different fault modes."},"883":{"dur":2,"text":"Some fault modes that\nhappen very often"},"885":{"dur":3,"text":"is with the gyroscopes."},"888":{"dur":4,"text":"So for Kepler, or even\non the space station"},"893":{"dur":3,"text":"there are some\nmisbehaving gyroscopes"},"897":{"dur":2,"text":"which can be traced down\nto the ball bearings that"},"900":{"dur":2,"text":"have certain issues when\nyou operate them in vacuum"},"902":{"dur":3,"text":"because the lubricant\ntends to behave"},"906":{"dur":5,"text":"very different in a gravity\nfree space than with gravity."},"912":{"dur":3,"text":"In some other cases you have\ncommunications equipment"},"915":{"dur":6,"text":"that malfunctions, perhaps due\nto the presence of radiation."},"922":{"dur":3,"text":"And so you have single\nevent upsets, and other kind"},"926":{"dur":4,"text":"of fault modes that\ncause some issues."},"930":{"dur":5,"text":"You may have shorts because\nwhen you're launching something"},"936":{"dur":3,"text":"you have incredible\nvibration, and the harnesses"},"939":{"dur":1,"text":"are rattling around."},"941":{"dur":2,"text":"It might be rubbing\non the fuselage,"},"944":{"dur":2,"text":"and something might short out\nthat you didn't anticipate."},"949":{"dur":3,"text":"You may have\nsoftware faults where"},"952":{"dur":2,"text":"you have inactions of\ndifferent software components"},"955":{"dur":3,"text":"that you didn't anticipate\nbecause you have"},"958":{"dur":3,"text":"some new kind of conditions that\nyou never encountered before,"},"962":{"dur":3,"text":"and the software was not\nmeant to handle that."},"965":{"dur":4,"text":"And so it does something\nunanticipated, and it breaks."},"970":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's really a myriad of\ndifferent kinds of fault modes."},"974":{"dur":2,"text":"And that makes it\nalso so difficult"},"976":{"dur":6,"text":"to anticipate all\nof them, and to care"},"983":{"dur":1,"text":"of all of them ahead of time."},"985":{"dur":1,"text":"That is of course the idea."},"987":{"dur":2,"text":"That is what you\nwould like to do here."},"989":{"dur":4,"text":"You try to design out\nthese kind of fault modes"},"994":{"dur":1,"text":"that you know about."},"995":{"dur":2,"text":"Right, and here\nthe Rolls Royce is"},"998":{"dur":3,"text":"an example of that\nwhere it was built,"},"1001":{"dur":2,"text":"and then something broke,\nand then the next generation"},"1004":{"dur":3,"text":"they built a more reliable one."},"1007":{"dur":1,"text":"And then something\nelse broke, and they"},"1009":{"dur":1,"text":"tried to take care of that."},"1010":{"dur":3,"text":"And you end up\nwith two ton beast"},"1014":{"dur":2,"text":"which costs you an\nincredible amount of money"},"1016":{"dur":2,"text":"but which is known to\nbe very, very reliable."},"1019":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's one of\nthe trade offs then."},"1023":{"dur":2,"text":"Right, so how much money\ndo you want to spend,"},"1025":{"dur":4,"text":"and how much risk\ndo you want to incur"},"1029":{"dur":2,"text":"operating these kind of things."},"1031":{"dur":4,"text":"You can also build redundancies,\nlike in this car where"},"1036":{"dur":6,"text":"you have sort of the dual tires\nin the back where one can blow"},"1043":{"dur":1,"text":"and you can still\nactually drive this thing."},"1045":{"dur":2,"text":"It doesn't immediately tip over."},"1047":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's an easy\nexample of redundancy,"},"1050":{"dur":6,"text":"but in space systems you\nhave redundancies everywhere."},"1056":{"dur":4,"text":"Or oftentimes triple\nor quadruple redundancy"},"1060":{"dur":3,"text":"to account for the fact\nthat something might break,"},"1063":{"dur":4,"text":"but you still need to be\nable to operate your system."},"1068":{"dur":3,"text":"And, of course, it\ncomes at the expense"},"1071":{"dur":3,"text":"of more weight, and\nsize, and, again, cost."},"1074":{"dur":4,"text":"Right, so each kilogram that\nyou have to bring into space"},"1079":{"dur":2,"text":"costs you thousands of dollars."},"1081":{"dur":4,"text":"So you are thinking very\ncarefully, how much more"},"1086":{"dur":2,"text":"redundancy do I put on\nthese kind of systems."},"1088":{"dur":4,"text":"And right now we are going\ntowards these nano cube,"},"1093":{"dur":2,"text":"or nano satellites,\nwhere you really"},"1096":{"dur":2,"text":"can't afford to have\na lot of redundancy"},"1098":{"dur":3,"text":"because these are\ncontradictions in themselves."},"1106":{"dur":2,"text":"So as an alternative\nyou could try"},"1108":{"dur":3,"text":"to recognize impending\nfailure ahead of time"},"1112":{"dur":6,"text":"through analysis and\ninference, and then you"},"1118":{"dur":4,"text":"could try to handle the\nfault ahead of time,"},"1122":{"dur":2,"text":"handle your remaining\nresources, possibly extend"},"1125":{"dur":6,"text":"the life by reducing\nthe load by moving up"},"1132":{"dur":4,"text":"the important experiments that\nyou still need to carry out,"},"1136":{"dur":4,"text":"or the important maneuvers that\nyou still want to carry out,"},"1140":{"dur":3,"text":"or doing some other\nactive kind of thing."},"1143":{"dur":4,"text":"So in general having information\nthat something is awry"},"1148":{"dur":4,"text":"and going towards a bad\nstate is a good thing."},"1153":{"dur":3,"text":"Right, so here's a picture\neverybody recognizes."},"1156":{"dur":2,"text":"This was the Hurricane Katrina."},"1159":{"dur":2,"text":"This was the path that it\nwas anticipated to take."},"1162":{"dur":4,"text":"And certainly knowing that is\nbetter than not knowing that,"},"1166":{"dur":2,"text":"because you can\nevacuate people, and you"},"1168":{"dur":4,"text":"can take some sort\nof measures to deal"},"1172":{"dur":1,"text":"with the kind of situation."},"1176":{"dur":4,"text":"So how does one determine\nequipment health?"},"1180":{"dur":2,"text":"So here's a cartoon of a rocket."},"1183":{"dur":4,"text":"And the method for that\nthat we're using really"},"1187":{"dur":3,"text":"is one of health,\nof human health."},"1191":{"dur":3,"text":"So what we are doing\nis we are going,"},"1194":{"dur":5,"text":"and we're trying to\nactually check out"},"1200":{"dur":2,"text":"what is the heartbeat\nof the equipment."},"1202":{"dur":2,"text":"And then you go\nand say, OK, that's"},"1205":{"dur":4,"text":"good information, but what\nabout the temperature?"},"1210":{"dur":4,"text":"Right, so having the kind of\ndual independent information"},"1214":{"dur":2,"text":"is even more important."},"1216":{"dur":5,"text":"And then maybe I can\nput an ECG on my rocket,"},"1221":{"dur":4,"text":"and figure out what is the state\nof health of the equipment."},"1226":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, if we stay with\nthe ECG for a moment"},"1231":{"dur":5,"text":"you go through a series\nof steps to analyze"},"1237":{"dur":1,"text":"the health of a patient."},"1239":{"dur":4,"text":"Right, so first you\ntake your probes here."},"1243":{"dur":2,"text":"Right, and some of\nyou may have already"},"1246":{"dur":4,"text":"had the pleasure or lack thereof\nof having to go through that."},"1250":{"dur":1,"text":"Right, and

escape."},"2569":{"dur":6,"text":"And if everything fails\nthis particular valve"},"2575":{"dur":1,"text":"has a fail-safe of closed."},"2577":{"dur":3,"text":"Right, so the return spring\nthen forces the plug down,"},"2581":{"dur":2,"text":"and it interrupts the pressure."},"2583":{"dur":7,"text":"Now, seems extremely simple,\nbut if you have some wear here"},"2590":{"dur":2,"text":"then you have

here."},"2748":{"dur":5,"text":"And then you go and look at what\nkind of sensors do you have?"},"2753":{"dur":2,"text":"And from that you\ncan then model what"},"2756":{"dur":1,"text":"is your
