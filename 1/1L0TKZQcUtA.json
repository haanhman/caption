miles."},"4602":{"dur":5,"text":"That's a point 0.000001% margin of error."},"4607":{"dur":4,"text":"That's through all the time you spend on the road, that is the error you get."},"4612":{"dur":4,"text":"More impressed with ImageNet being able to classify a leopard, a cat or a dog"},"4619":{"dur":4,"text":"at above human level performance but this is the margin of error we get with driving."},"4625":{"dur":5,"text":"And we have to be able to deal with snow, with heavy rain, with big open parking lots,"},"4632":{"dur":6,"text":"with parking garages, any pedestrians that behaves irresponsibly as rarely as that happens"},"4639":{"dur":5,"text":"or just some predictably, again especially in Boston, reflections."},"4646":{"dur":3,"text":"The ones especially some things you don't think about:"},"4649":{"dur":3,"text":"the lighting variations that blind the cameras."},"4655":{"dur":5,"text":"(Inaudible question from one of the attendees)"},"4661":{"dur":6,"text":"The question was if that number changes, if you look at just crashes, the fatalities per crash."},"4671":{"dur":5,"text":"So one of the big things is that cars have gotten really good at crashing and not hurting anybody."},"4678":{"dur":3,"text":"So the number of crashes is much, much larger than the number of fatalities"},"4681":{"dur":3,"text":"which is a great thing, we've built safer cars."},"4685":{"dur":3,"text":"But still, you know even one fatality is too many."},"4693":{"dur":5,"text":"So this is one that Google self-driving car team"},"4700":{"dur":7,"text":"is quite open about their performance since hitting public road,"},"4709":{"dur":2,"text":"this is from a report that shows the number of times"},"4713":{"dur":1,"text":"the driver disengaged"},"4716":{"dur":3,"text":"the car gives up control,"},"4721":{"dur":2,"text":"that it asked the driver to take control back"},"4723":{"dur":1,"text":"or the driver takes control back by force."},"4725":{"dur":4,"text":"Meaning that they're unhappy with the decision that the car was making"},"4730":{"dur":4,"text":"or it was putting the car or other pedestrians or other cars in unsafe situations."},"4735":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, if you see over time there's been a total"},"4739":{"dur":2,"text":"from 2014 to 2015"},"4743":{"dur":4,"text":"there's been a total of 341 times on beautiful San Francisco roads"},"4749":{"dur":3,"text":"and I say that seriously because the weather conditions are great there,"},"4753":{"dur":4,"text":"341 times that the driver had to elect to control back."},"4759":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's a work in progress."},"4761":{"dur":3,"text":"And let me give you something to think about here."},"4765":{"dur":5,"text":"This, with neural networks is a big open question."},"4771":{"dur":1,"text":"The question of robustness."},"4775":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is an amazing paper, I encourage people to read it."},"4778":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a couple of papers around this topic."},"4781":{"dur":1,"text":"Deep neural networks are easily fooled."},"4785":{"dur":7,"text":"So here are 8 images where, if given to a neural network as input,"},"4792":{"dur":7,"text":"a convolutional  neural network as input, the network with higher than 99.6% confidence says"},"4801":{"dur":2,"text":"that the image, for example the top left, as a robin."},"4804":{"dur":5,"text":"Next to is a cheetah, then an armadillo, a panda, an electric guitar,"},"4810":{"dur":2,"text":"a baseball, a starfish, a king penguin."},"4813":{"dur":3,"text":"All of these things are obviously not in the images."},"4816":{"dur":2,"text":"So the networks can be fooled with noise."},"4821":{"dur":7,"text":"More importantly, practically for the real world, adding just a little bit of distortion,"},"4829":{"dur":8,"text":"a little bit of noise distortion to the image, can force the network to produce a totally wrong prediction."},"4837":{"dur":4,"text":"So here's an example, there's 3 columns,"},"4842":{"dur":5,"text":"correct image classification, the slight addition of distortion"},"4848":{"dur":4,"text":"and the resulting prediction of an ostrich for all three images on the left"},"4854":{"dur":4,"text":"and a prediction of an ostrich for all three images on the right."},"4860":{"dur":5,"text":"This ability to fool networks easily brings up an important point."},"4866":{"dur":7,"text":"And that point is that there has been a lot of excitement"},"4875":{"dur":1,"text":"about neural networks throughout their history."},"4877":{"dur":3,"text":"There's been a lot of excitement about artificial intelligence throughout its history"},"4881":{"dur":6,"text":"and not coupling that excitement, not granting that excitement, in the reality"},"4888":{"dur":10,"text":"the real challenges around that has resulted in in crashes, in A.I. winters when funding dried out"},"4900":{"dur":4,"text":"and people became hopeless in terms of the possibilities of artificial intelligence."},"4905":{"dur":6,"text":"So here is the 1958 New York Times article that said the Navy revealed the embryo of an electronic computer today."},"4912":{"dur":3,"text":"This is when the first perceptron that I talked about"},"4915":{"dur":3,"text":"was implemented in hardware by Frank Rosenblatt."},"4920":{"dur":4,"text":"It took 400 pixel image input and it provided a single output."},"4926":{"dur":3,"text":"Weights were encoded in the hardware potentiometers"},"4930":{"dur":1,"text":"and waves were updated with electric motors."},"4932":{"dur":4,"text":"Now New York Times wrote, the Navy revealed the embryo vanilla electronic computer today"},"4937":{"dur":8,"text":"that expects will be able to walk, talk, see, write, reproduce itself and be conscious of its existence."},"4948":{"dur":5,"text":"Dr. Frank Rosenblatt, a research psychologist at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory in Buffalo,"},"4954":{"dur":4,"text":"said perceptrons might be fired to the planets as mechanical space explorers."},"4960":{"dur":4,"text":"This might seem ridiculous but this is the general opinion of the time."},"4967":{"dur":5,"text":"And as we know now, perceptrons cannot even separate a non-linear function."},"4975":{"dur":1,"text":"They're just linear classifiers."},"4978":{"dur":6,"text":"And so this led to 2 major A.I. winters in the 70s, in the late 80s and early 90s."},"4988":{"dur":7,"text":"The Lighthill Report, in 1973 by the UK government, said there are no part of the field"},"4995":{"dur":3,"text":"of discoveries made so far produced the major impact that was promised."},"4999":{"dur":7,"text":"So if the hype builds beyond the capabilities of our research,"},"5008":{"dur":6,"text":"reports like this will come and they have the possibility of creating another A.I. winter."},"5015":{"dur":4,"text":"So I want to pare the optimism, some of the cool things we'll talk about in this class,"},"5021":{"dur":2,"text":"with the reality of the challenges ahead of us."},"5029":{"dur":5,"text":"The focus of the research community, this is some of the key players in deep learning,"},"5036":{"dur":4,"text":"what are the things that are next for deep learning, the five year vision?"},"5043":{"dur":3,"text":"We want to run on smaller, cheaper mobile devices."},"5048":{"dur":4,"text":"We want to explore more in the space of unsupervised learning as I mentioned"},"5053":{"dur":1,"text":"and reinforcement learning."},"5056":{"dur":6,"text":"We want to do things that explore the space of videos more,"},"5063":{"dur":4,"text":"the recurring neural networks, like being able to summarize videos or generate short videos."},"5069":{"dur":4,"text":"One of the big efforts, especially in the companies we do in large data,"},"5074":{"dur":1,"text":"is multi-modal learning."},"5076":{"dur":3,"text":"Learning from multiple data sets with multiple sources of data."},"5081":{"dur":4,"text":"And lastly, making money from these technologies."},"5086":{"dur":5,"text":"There's a lot of this despite the excitement."},"5092":{"dur":4,"text":"There has been an inability for the most part to make serious money"},"5097":{"dur":4,"text":"from some of the more interesting parts of deep learning."},"5106":{"dur":7,"text":"And while I got made fun of by the TAs for including this slide"},"5113":{"dur":2,"text":"because it's shown in so many sort of business type lectures,"},"5116":{"dur":3,"text":"but it is true that we're at the peak of a hype cycle"},"5120":{"dur":5,"text":"and we have to make sure be given the large amount of hype and excited there is,"},"5127":{"dur":1,"text":"we proceed with caution."},"5136":{"dur":9,"text":"One example of that, let me mention, is we already talked about spoofing the cameras."},"5145":{"dur":1,"text":"Spoofing the cameras with a little bit of noise."},"5147":{"dur":5,"text":"So if you think about it, self-driving vehicles operate with a set of sensors"},"5154":{"dur":4,"text":"and they rely on those sensors to convey to accurately capture that information."},"5159":{"dur":7,"text":"And what happens, not only when the world itself produces noisy visual information,"},"5167":{"dur":2,"text":"but what if somebody actually tries to spoof that data."},"5171":{"dur":3,"text":"One of the fascinating things have been recently done is spoofing of LIDAR."},"5176":{"dur":6,"text":"So these LIDAR is a range sense that gives a 3D-point cloud of the objects in the external environment."},"5183":{"dur":6,"text":"And you're able to successfully do a replay attack where you have the car"},"5190":{"dur":3,"text":"see people in other cars around it when there's actually nothing around it."},"5196":{"dur":4,"text":"In the same way that you can spoof a camera to see things that are not there."},"5202":{"dur":0,"text":"A neural network."},"5204":{"dur":4,"text":"So let me run through some of the libraries that we'll work with"},"5209":{"dur":4,"text":"and they're out there that you my work with if you proceed with deep learning."},"5214":{"dur":3,"text":"TensorFlow, that is the most popular one these days."},"5219":{"dur":2,"text":"It's heavily backed and developed by Google."},"5223":{"dur":9,"text":"It's primarily a python interface and is very good at operating on multiple GPUs."},"5234":{"dur":6,"text":"There's Keras and also TF Learn and TF Slim which are libraries that operate on top of TensorFlow"},"5242":{"dur":6,"text":"that make it slightly easier, slightly more user friendly interfaces, to get up and running."},"5254":{"dur":5,"text":"Torch, if you're interested to get in at the lower level"},"5260":{"dur":2,"text":"tweaking of the different parameters of neural networks"},"5262":{"dur":2,"text":"creating your own architectures."},"5265":{"dur":4,"text":"Torch is excellent for that with it's own Lua interface."},"5269":{"dur":4,"text":"Lua's a programming language and heavily backed by Facebook."},"5274":{"dur":4,"text":"There is the old school \"theano\" which is what I started on a lot of people early on,"},"5279":{"dur":4,"text":"in deep learning started on, as one of the first libraries that supported"},"5284":{"dur":1,"text":"ahead came with GPU support."},"5286":{"dur":4,"text":"It definitely encourages lower level tinkering, has a python interface."},"5292":{"dur":6,"text":"And many of these, if not all, rely on Nvidia's library"},"5299":{"dur":9,"text":"for doing some of the low level computations involved with training these neural networks on Nvidia GPUs."},"5310":{"dur":8,"text":"\"mxnet\" heavily supported by Amazon and they have officially recently announced"},"5318":{"dur":5,"text":"that they're going to be, their AWS, is going to be all in on the mxnet."},"5326":{"dur":8,"text":"Neon, recently bought by Intel, started out as a manufacturer of neural network chips"},"5335":{"dur":4,"text":"which is really exciting and it performs exceptionally well."},"5340":{"dur":0,"text":"I hear good things."},"5342":{"dur":6,"text":"Caffe, started in Berkeley, also was very popular in Google before Tensorlow came out."},"5350":{"dur":3,"text":"It's primarily designed for computer vision with ConvNet's"},"5354":{"dur":4,"text":"but has now expanded to all of the domains."},"5361":{"dur":4,"text":"There is CNTK, used to be known and now called the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit."},"5365":{"dur":2,"text":"Nobody calls it that still I'm aware of."},"5369":{"dur":6,"text":"It says multi GPU support, has its own brain script custom language"},"5376":{"dur":1,"text":"as well as other interfaces."},"5379":{"dur":6,"text":"And we'll get to play around in this class is, amazingly, deep learning in the browser, right."},"5387":{"dur":6,"text":"Our favorite is ConvNetJS, what you use, built by Andrej Karpathy from Stanford now OpenAI."},"5395":{"dur":2,"text":"It's good for explaining the basic concept of neural networks."},"5398":{"dur":4,"text":"It's fun to play around with.  All you need is a browser and some very few requirements."},"5403":{"dur":2,"text":"It can't leverage GPUs, unfortunately."},"5408":{"dur":2,"text":"But for a lot of things that we're doing, you don't need GPUs."},"5410":{"dur":5,"text":"You'd be able to train a network with very little and relatively efficiently without the [01:30:15] GPUs."},"5416":{"dur":5,"text":"It has full support for CNNs, RNNs  and even deeper reinforcement learning."},"5423":{"dur":4,"text":"Keras.js, which seems incredible, we try to use for this class."},"5431":{"dur":4,"text":"It has GPU support so it runs in the browser with GPU support"},"5435":{"dur":4,"text":"with Open GL or however it works magically"},"5440":{"dur":3,"text":"but we're able to accomplish a lot of things we need without the use of GPUs."},"5446":{"dur":7,"text":"It's incredible to live in a day and age when it literally, as I'll show on the tutorials,"},"5454":{"dur":4,"text":"it takes just a few minutes to get started with building your own neural network"},"5458":{"dur":5,"text":"that classifies images and a lot of these libraries are friendly in that way."},"5464":{"dur":3,"text":"So all the references mentioned in this presentation"},"5468":{"dur":3,"text":"are available at this link and the slides are available there as well."},"5473":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think in the interest of time, let me wrap up."},"5476":{"dur":6,"text":"Thank you so much for coming in today and tomorrow I'll explain the deep reinforcement learning game"},"5483":{"dur":2,"text":"and the actual competition and how you can win."},"5486":{"dur":0,"text":"Thanks very much guys."}}
