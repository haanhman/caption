before?"},"64":{"dur":1,"text":"Show of hands."},"65":{"dur":1,"text":"Wow, everybody."},"66":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, it was a little bit of a\ntrick question, because the"},"69":{"dur":2,"text":"only

Payments."},"119":{"dur":4,"text":"And since we launched, we've\nlearned that developers are"},"123":{"dur":1,"text":"using this for a whole lot more"},"125":{"dur":1,"text":"than just in-app payments."},"126":{"dur":2,"text":"So they're using it to monetize\nall kinds of digital"},"129":{"dur":5,"text":"content, whether it's virtual\nswords within a game or"},"134":{"dur":4,"text":"whether it's music videos,\nonline articles, et cetera."},"139":{"dur":2,"text":"So Google Wallet is really for\nthe gamut of all of the"},"142":{"dur":1,"text":"digital content that developers"},"143":{"dur":1,"text":"are looking to monetize."},"147":{"dur":2,"text":"And the beautiful thing about\nGoogle Wallet is that it"},"150":{"dur":2,"text":"already powers all of Google."},"152":{"dur":4,"text":"So if you look at the technology\nbehind payments for"},"156":{"dur":5,"text":"Google Play, Offers, YouTube,\nGoogle+ Games, Chrome Web"},"161":{"dur":3,"text":"Store, all of this is powered\nby Google Wallet."},"165":{"dur":4,"text":"And so developers get access\nto the huge technology"},"169":{"dur":2,"text":"investments that we

Google Wallet."},"198":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's a ton of momentum,\nand there's already hundreds"},"201":{"dur":1,"text":"of developers on\nGoogle Wallet."},"203":{"dur":2,"text":"And with today's announcements,\nwe're looking"},"206":{"dur":1,"text":"to scale this much, much more."},"210":{"dur":3,"text":"Now when we started Google\nWallet, we looked at three key"},"213":{"dur":0,"text":"principles."},"214":{"dur":2,"text":"The first principle was really\nto have a streamlined"},"217":{"dur":0,"text":"experience."},"218":{"dur":4,"text":"We wanted to make it as simple\nto buy with Google Wallet as"},"222":{"dur":2,"text":"it is to click a button\non the screen."},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you look at signed-in\nusers today with Google"},"227":{"dur":2,"text":"Wallet, that's all it takes."},"229":{"dur":2,"text":"And we're going to demonstrate\na little bit of that purchase"},"232":{"dur":1,"text":"experience here."},"233":{"dur":2,"text":"But it's just one click,\nand you're done."},"236":{"dur":3,"text":"The second key principle we\nwanted to start off with was,"},"239":{"dur":3,"text":"make it really simple to\nintegrate with this product."},"243":{"dur":3,"text":"And we're going to hit upon this\ntheme a lot more during"},"246":{"dur":1,"text":"the rest of the session."},"248":{"dur":8,"text":"And a big, big point that we've\nactually focused on, a"},"256":{"dur":3,"text":"point of focus we've had\nthroughout this process of"},"259":{"dur":2,"text":"launching Google Wallet for\ndigital goods, is to make the"},"262":{"dur":1,"text":"integration very, very simple."},"263":{"dur":2,"text":"In many cases, developers have\ntold us that it takes just a"},"266":{"dur":2,"text":"couple of hours to integrate."},"269":{"dur":3,"text":"And we'll demonstrate some\nof that as well."},"272":{"dur":2,"text":"And the last one was, of course,\nattractive pricing."},"274":{"dur":2,"text":"We wanted to make sure that we\nincrease developer bottom"},"277":{"dur":2,"text":"lines as much as possible."},"279":{"dur":3,"text":"And we'll talk a little bit\nmore about this as well."},"282":{"dur":4,"text":"Now since we launched last year\nat Google I\/O, we've been"},"286":{"dur":0,"text":"hard at work."},"287":{"dur":1,"text":"So we've done a bunch\nof different things."},"289":{"dur":3,"text":"The first, of course, is that\nin July and August, we"},"293":{"dur":3,"text":"launched support for Chrome Web\nStore and Google+ Games"},"296":{"dur":0,"text":"developers."},"297":{"dur":4,"text":"So anyone on the Chrome Web\nStore or Google+ Games can use"},"301":{"dur":3,"text":"Google Wallet to monetize\ntheir digital content."},"305":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, in the fall, we\nstreamlined the user"},"307":{"dur":4,"text":"experience to this one-step\nprocess that I just described."},"312":{"dur":3,"text":"In December of last year, we\nexpanded support from the"},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"United States to 18\nseller countries."},"319":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you're developers in any\nof these seller countries, you"},"321":{"dur":3,"text":"can start using Google Wallet\nfor digital goods right away."},"325":{"dur":3,"text":"And the other big win was\nexpanding this product to"},"328":{"dur":2,"text":"140-plus buyer countries."},"331":{"dur":4,"text":"So you have buyers that you\ncan target across 140"},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"countries on the planet."},"338":{"dur":3,"text":"We, of course, support nine\ncurrencies as well."},"341":{"dur":5,"text":"Now in January, we launched\nanother big push with Google"},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"Wallet in making the\nsignup easier."},"349":{"dur":3,"text":"And with the new signup flow\nthat we have, all we collect"},"353":{"dur":5,"text":"from a new user is, apart from\nyour credit card details, just"},"359":{"dur":1,"text":"your name and zip code."},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can sign up, and\nit's that simple."},"363":{"dur":3,"text":"And we've seen conversions\ngo up big-time after this"},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"particular launch."},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"And then in March this year, we"},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"launched Mobile Web Support."},"373":{"dur":3,"text":"The nice thing about Mobile Web\nSupport is now, if a user"},"377":{"dur":5,"text":"actually comes to your site or\nyour app on a mobile device"},"382":{"dur":3,"text":"and they're using a mobile\nbrowser, we'll present to them"},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"a streamlined mobile\nweb experience."},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"And the cool thing about this\nis that you don't have to do"},"390":{"dur":1,"text":"even one bit of work for this."},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"We just detect the device and\nautomatically present the"},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"right flow, whether you're\ncoming through your PC, or"},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"you're coming on your\nmobile phone."},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"And the last couple of months\nhave been really, really busy"},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"on our team--"},"404":{"dur":2,"text":"Dan and Joel can attest\nto that--"},"406":{"dur":3,"text":"because we've been hard at work\non three cool things that"},"410":{"dur":1,"text":"we want to talk about today."},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"And the first of them, of\ncourse, is something that"},"415":{"dur":3,"text":"we've got lots and lots of\nfeedback on throughout the"},"418":{"dur":5,"text":"course of this launch\nin this last year."},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"Developers love that we\nallow single-item"},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"purchases to be so simple."},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"But one of the consistent pieces\nof feedback that we've"},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"always got is, when are\nyou going to support"},"434":{"dur":0,"text":"subscriptions?"},"435":{"dur":4,"text":"So without further ado, as\nof today, we support"},"439":{"dur":6,"text":"[APPLAUSE]"},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"The nice thing about the\nsubscription functionality we"},"448":{"dur":3,"text":"are doing is that it's as\nsimple to use as our"},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"single-item purchase."},"453":{"dur":3,"text":"So the user has still just\nthis one-step process we"},"457":{"dur":4,"text":"A signed-in Wallet user just has\none step to subscribe to"},"461":{"dur":1,"text":"your content, right?"},"463":{"dur":3,"text":"They just click the Finish\nbutton and they're done."},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"We're going to lunch with\nmonthly subscription support."},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"And we'll do free trials\nright away."},"472":{"dur":1,"text":"And the coolest thing\nabout this is that"},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"it's live in Sandbox."},"476":{"dur":4,"text":"So whether it's to go buy our\nGoogle Wallet desk, which is"},"480":{"dur":5,"text":"on the second floor, right on\nthis floor here, or the Code"},"486":{"dur":4,"text":"Lab at 1:15 on Friday, you can\ngo in and try this out."},"490":{"dur":3,"text":"And feel free to knock on this\nand go use this product,"},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"because it's already live."},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"So look forward to all you\ndevelopers taking advantage of"},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"this, including those who\nare doing this live"},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"stream on the web."},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"Now of course, once we launch\nsubscriptions, the first"},"509":{"dur":1,"text":"question, of course, was how\nwould we do subscription"},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"And how would we give merchants\nand developers the"},"513":{"dur":1,"text":"way to do subscription\nmanagement, including"},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"canceling subscriptions when a\nuser calls you, et cetera?"},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"And so we're doing a\nrevamp of all our"},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"merchant services as well."},"522":{"dur":4,"text":"And you guys will see this soon,\nwhere we're going to"},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"give you a much more streamlined\ninterface and"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"subscription management\nfunctionality."},"533":{"dur":1,"text":"Pretty cool."},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"But while we were revamping\nthis, we figured, why don't we"},"537":{"dur":3,"text":"just go ahead and improve\nthe analytics?"},"540":{"dur":4,"text":"So when this new functionality\nlaunches, we're going to give"},"544":{"dur":1,"text":"you enhanced analytics."},"546":{"dur":6,"text":"So we've got all of this really\nrich demographic data"},"552":{"dur":1,"text":"that we're going to\nbring to bear."},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"And we're going to give you\nanalytics, whether it's by"},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"gender, by age, or country."},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"And we'll give you really cool\ngraphs to show you how your"},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"sales have been trending as\nyou introduce new digital"},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"content, new pricing\nto your users."},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"You can take advantage of that\nas soon as we launch this"},"570":{"dur":1,"text":"functionality."},"574":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, with that, I want to hand\nover to Dan and Joel to talk"},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"about what's most important to\nyou guys, which is how easy"},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"the integration is\ngoing to be."},"583":{"dur":0,"text":"DAN ZINK: All right."},"584":{"dur":1,"text":"Thanks, Pali."},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"Hi, I'm Dan."},"587":{"dur":0,"text":"JOEL LEITCH: And I'm Joel."},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"DAN ZINK: And we're both\nengineers working on Google"},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"Wallet for digital goods."},"591":{"dur":3,"text":"We'd like to talk a little bit\nabout integration right now."},"594":{"dur":3,"text":"So since we announced the\nproduct a year ago, not much"},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"has changed with integration."},"599":{"dur":1,"text":"What we do, if you want to\nintegrate with Google Wallets"},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"for digital goods, what you do\nis you create a JWT, or a J,"},"605":{"dur":3,"text":"W, T, which stands for\na JSON Web Token."},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"This describes the thing\nthat you're selling."},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"I've got an example here\non the screen."},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a data structure here that\nholds the description of"},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"a digital item being sold."},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"You can see in here, we've got\nthe issuer, which is the"},"620":{"dur":3,"text":"person selling the item, the\naudience, which is us, Google."},"624":{"dur":3,"text":"We've got an issued-at time\nand an expiration date and"},"627":{"dur":0,"text":"also a type."},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"The \"type\" field there\nis important."},"630":{"dur":3,"text":"It's just \"typ.\" It says\nthe type of purchase"},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"that is being made."},"635":{"dur":2,"text":"That purchase is described\nin the request"},"637":{"dur":1,"text":"substructure in here."},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"And in there, you can see the\nname, description, price, and"},"642":{"dur":3,"text":"currency code of what's being\nsold, along with an optional"},"645":{"dur":3,"text":"field called \"seller data.\"\nGoogle does not interpret the"},"649":{"dur":3,"text":"We simply hold onto it and echo\nit back to you later once"},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"a purchase or a subscription\nhas been completed."},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a good place to do your\nown record-keeping."},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"So once you've created the JWT,\nbasically once you've"},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"create that data structure and\nrun it through a JWT library"},"663":{"dur":5,"text":"that will actually JSON encode\nit, and base64 encode it, and"},"669":{"dur":1,"text":"sign in with your secret key."},"671":{"dur":3,"text":"Then you need to pass it into\nour JavaScript library."},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"We've tried to keep this\nvery simple as well."},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"What you would typically do\nhere is put your own \"Buy\""},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"button on your page,\nbind the \"Buy\""},"683":{"dur":1,"text":"button to a click handler."},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"In this case, we've called it\n\"purchase.\" And in that"},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"\"purchase\" function-- this is\njust a JavaScript function--"},"690":{"dur":3,"text":"you can pass the JWT into\nour JavaScript Buy call."},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"Along with the JWT,\nyou can provide a"},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"success and failure callback."},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"These, again, are just\nJavaScript functions."},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"And they get called when\nsomebody exits the buy flow."},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"Now with subscriptions it's\nreally, really similar."},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"So if you've already integrated\nfor items, then"},"708":{"dur":1,"text":"doing it for a subscription\nshould be pretty"},"709":{"dur":1,"text":"straightforward."},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"I've highlighted the\nchanges in yellow."},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"The JWT structure is\nslightly different."},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"Instead of being for an item in\nthe \"type\" field, it's for"},"718":{"dur":1,"text":"a subscription instead."},"720":{"dur":2,"text":"And the contents of the request\nsubstructure are"},"722":{"dur":1,"text":"slightly different as well."},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"Instead of having the price and\ncurrency code right there"},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"in the request, we've got\nanother structure inside of"},"729":{"dur":1,"text":"there that we call\na recurrence."},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"And in there we've got price,\ncurrency code, and frequency."},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can see in this example,\nwe're charging $4.99"},"737":{"dur":1,"text":"a month, USD."},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"JOEL LEITCH: So wait\na second, Dan."},"740":{"dur":1,"text":"DAN ZINK: What, Joel?"},"741":{"dur":0,"text":"JOEL LEITCH: We have\nan audience full of"},"742":{"dur":0,"text":"developers out here."},"743":{"dur":0,"text":"DAN ZINK: We do."},"744":{"dur":1,"text":"JOEL LEITCH: So let's just do\nthe live integration right"},"745":{"dur":0,"text":"here on stage."},"746":{"dur":0,"text":"DAN ZINK: A live demo."},"747":{"dur":1,"text":"JOEL LEITCH: Yeah,\nlet's do it."},"748":{"dur":0,"text":"DAN ZINK: All right."},"749":{"dur":1,"text":"Do you have any site in mind\nthat you might want to"},"750":{"dur":0,"text":"integrate with?"},"751":{"dur":1,"text":"JOEL LEITCH: I do, actually."},"753":{"dur":1,"text":"You know my dogs, right?"},"754":{"dur":0,"text":"DAN ZINK: Yeah, I\nlove your dogs."},"755":{"dur":2,"text":"JOEL LEITCH: So I have two\ndogs, Pepper and Nutmeg."},"757":{"dur":0,"text":"They're pugs."},"758":{"dur":1,"text":"And I've written a\nblog about them."},"760":{"dur":1,"text":"DAN ZINK: Oh, cool."},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"JOEL LEITCH: So why don't we\njust integrate subscriptions"},"762":{"dur":0,"text":"right into my blog."},"763":{"dur":1,"text":"DAN ZINK: Sounds like\na great idea."},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"So before we get started, I want\nto go through the basic"},"766":{"dur":3,"text":"steps we're going to do to\nintegrate with your blog."},"770":{"dur":2,"text":"We're going to first add a\nbuy button to your blog."},"772":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a button somebody can\nclick on to subscribe."},"775":{"dur":1,"text":"And then we're going to\ngo through building"},"776":{"dur":1,"text":"a JWT on your server."},"778":{"dur":2,"text":"And then we're going to take\nthat JWT and pass it into our"},"781":{"dur":1,"text":"JavaScript Buy function."},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"And then finally, the last step\nis that we're going to"},"785":{"dur":1,"text":"handle the postback."},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is the server-to-server\ncall that"},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"Google makes back to your server\nonce the payment has"},"791":{"dur":3,"text":"been completed, whether it\nbe a subscription or a"},"794":{"dur":1,"text":"single-item purchase."},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"So why don't we start off by\ntaking a look at my blog?"},"799":{"dur":1,"text":"DAN ZINK: Yeah, let's do that."},"804":{"dur":1,"text":"JOEL LEITCH: So there\nyou see it."},"806":{"dur":1,"text":"There's my pugs, Pepper\nand Nutmeg."},"808":{"dur":3,"text":"JOEL LEITCH: And some very,\nvery rich content on here."},"811":{"dur":0,"text":"DAN ZINK: Very nice."},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"JOEL LEITCH: But I'd like to\nmake some money off of this."},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"JOEL LEITCH: So let's walk\nthrough integrating"},"817":{"dur":0,"text":"subscriptions then."},"818":{"dur":0,"text":"DAN ZINK: That sounds good."},"819":{"dur":1,"text":"So Joel, just to make\nsure you've done"},"820":{"dur":0,"text":"some prep work here."},"821":{"dur":3,"text":"Have you already created a\nsubscriptions database table"},"824":{"dur":1,"text":"on your data store to\nkeep track of who's"},"826":{"dur":1,"text":"subscribed and who isn't?"},"827":{"dur":1,"text":"JOEL LEITCH: Yeah, I've\ngot that all set up."},"828":{"dur":0,"text":"DAN ZINK: OK, great."},"829":{"dur":2,"text":"So the first step that we want\nto do here is adding a buy"},"832":{"dur":1,"text":"button to your page."},"833":{"dur":4,"text":"So let's actually go into your\nserver code here and read the"},"838":{"dur":2,"text":"state of a user, to see if\nthey're subscribed or not, and"},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"then pass that into our web\ntemplate so we can show the"},"843":{"dur":1,"text":"appropriate messaging."},"844":{"dur":2,"text":"And what we're going to want to\ndo is show some different"},"846":{"dur":1,"text":"messaging for people that\nare subscribed versus"},"848":{"dur":1,"text":"unsubscribed."},"849":{"dur":0,"text":"JOEL LEITCH: OK."},"850":{"dur":5,"text":"So right now what I've got is,\nyou'll notice on line 36, I'm"},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"reading from my data store."},"857":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm passing an email to figure\nout whether or not this user"},"861":{"dur":1,"text":"has subscribed."},"862":{"dur":4,"text":"Later down on line 40, I'm\njust passing it into this"},"867":{"dur":2,"text":"template values data structure,\nwhich then"},"869":{"dur":2,"text":"propagates into the\nactual template."},"872":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'm going to open up the\ntemplate now, and I'm just"},"874":{"dur":2,"text":"going to make sure this premium\ncontent that you see"},"877":{"dur":5,"text":"on line 10 gets hidden behind\nthat \"has subscribed\" flag."},"882":{"dur":0,"text":"DAN ZINK: That sounds great."},"883":{"dur":2,"text":"So again, we're showing people\nwho haven't subscribed a"},"885":{"dur":2,"text":"\"subscribe\" button, and people\nwho have subscribed get the"},"887":{"dur":1,"text":"premium content."},"889":{"dur":3,"text":"JOEL LEITCH: So now I've got the\npremium content tucked in"},"892":{"dur":3,"text":"behind the \"if\" statement\nthat you see on line 9."},"896":{"dur":2,"text":"So if they have subscribed,\nthey're going to see this"},"898":{"dur":1,"text":"premium content."},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'm a grateful guy,\nso I'm going to thank"},"902":{"dur":1,"text":"you for your support."},"903":{"dur":0,"text":"DAN ZINK:

it"},"1451":{"dur":2,"text":"works in your mind."},"1453":{"dur":2,"text":"Break down the front end and\nback end, and how it works."},"1456":{"dur":3,"text":"For our team, this is really\nhelpful,

assign"},"1464":{"dur":2,"text":"it to different developers and\nbring it together later."},"1469":{"dur":2,"text":"Next, the JWT is\nvery important."},"1472":{"dur":5,"text":"So make sure that you use the\nlibraries that are provided."},"1477":{"dur":2,"text":"There's libraries provided\nfor multiple"},"1480":{"dur":1,"text":"different programming languages."},"1481":{"dur":1,"text":"Bring those into your\nproject and use it."},"1483":{"dur":1,"text":"There's no need to reinvent\nthe wheel."},"1487":{"dur":4,"text":"Especially because JWT errors\ncan cause problems in the"},"1491":{"dur":1,"text":"transaction, it won't work."},"1492":{"dur":1,"text":"So you don't want that at all."},"1494":{"dur":2,"text":"Another thing you want to do\nis create a unit test, such"},"1496":{"dur":3,"text":"that when you generate your JWT\ncode, you check it with"},"1500":{"dur":1,"text":"what's provided in\nthe sample code."},"1502":{"dur":2,"text":"You want to make sure those\nmatch up so you know and"},"1504":{"dur":2,"text":"you're pretty sure that\neverything works correctly."},"1507":{"dur":2,"text":"For us, we had a problem when\nwe were first working with"},"1509":{"dur":3,"text":"this code that the JWT wasn't\ngenerating correctly."},"1513":{"dur":2,"text":"So we drilled down to the\nspecific class where it was"},"1515":{"dur":2,"text":"happening, and we fixed\nthe problem."},"1517":{"dur":2,"text":"But then we followed it up by\nwriting a unit test and making"},"1520":{"dur":2,"text":"sure that that unit test always\nchecked that code to"},"1522":{"dur":1,"text":"make sure it was working."},"1524":{"dur":1,"text":"And then we never had that\nproblem anymore."},"1528":{"dur":1,"text":"Next, the Sandbox."},"1529":{"dur":1,"text":"The Sandbox is very helpful."},"1531":{"dur":2,"text":"Really, this is the first time\nwhere your front end and back"},"1534":{"dur":1,"text":"end are going to come

how"},"1540":{"dur":2,"text":"you're going to get real data\ninto your postback handler."},"1543":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is important to test\nand make sure that

database,"},"1551":{"dur":2,"text":"and everything looks great."},"1553":{"dur":2,"text":"Another good thing about this\nis that, in the Sandbox, you"},"1555":{"dur":1,"text":"have test credit

we"},"1575":{"dur":0,"text":"were testing in the Sandbox."},"1576":{"dur":1,"text":"We had a tight iteration loop."},"1578":{"dur":2,"text":"And then it was really great to\njust flip the switch and go"},"1580":{"dur":1,"text":"from Sandbox to production."},"1582":{"dur":1,"text":"It was very easy."},"1583":{"dur":1,"text":"So take advantage of\nthat resource."},"1588":{"dur":2,"text":"One of our

leave\nthat base and"},"1693":{"dur":3,"text":"pretend that never happened."},"1696":{"dur":3,"text":"I really need to get some\nmore powerful units."},"1700":{"dur":2,"text":"And our in-game

the"},"1898":{"dur":1,"text":"matcher postback and\nreally slam it."},"1900":{"dur":3,"text":"And make sure that the load and\nperformance is there and"},"1903":{"dur":3,"text":"looks good before you

everything."},"1940":{"dur":4,"text":"And lastly, think about other\ncountries outside of the US."},"1944":{"dur":3,"text":"The easy ones to pick off\nright away are

But I think this will\nstill be really, really"},"2007":{"dur":3,"text":"interesting to you guys."},"2010":{"dur":2,"text":"So last year when we announced\nthe pricing for

who're"},"2028":{"dur":2,"text":"looking to integrate with us."},"2031":{"dur":3,"text":"One of the things that we've\nalways been trying to do is"},"2034":{"dur":2,"text":"figure out how we can make\nit better for developers."},"2037":{"dur":2,"text":"And as some of our developers\nhave gotten traction, like"},"2040":{"dur":4,"text":"Kabam and others, they started\nto create these price

the feedback we\nget is that 5% is awesome when"},"2065":{"dur":3,"text":"you do a $1 transaction, because\nall Google Wallet"},"2069":{"dur":3,"text":"takes from you is $0.05."},"2072":{"dur":3,"text":"But it could be better for\nlarger transactions."},"2075":{"dur":4,"text":"So if it's $100 transaction or a\n$300 transaction, how do you"},"2080":{"dur":2,"text":"make it better for developers?"},"2082":{"dur":3,"text":"And the usual approach that all\nof the solutions in the"},"2086":{"dur":2,"text":"market take is that\nthey create a"},"2088":{"dur":2,"text":"micro transaction rate."},"2090":{"dur":3,"text":"This is like the 5% rate we\nhave, which is really awesome."},"2094":{"dur":3,"text":"And then they create another\nrate, which is for larger"},"2097":{"dur":2,"text":"transactions, or regular\ntransactions."},"2099":{"dur":5,"text":"And that rate usually is tiered\nalong different volume"},"2105":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you are higher volume,\nyou get a lower rate."},"2108":{"dur":4,"text":"It's all sorts of confusing\ntier structures."},"2112":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact, you probably need a\ndegree to figure out how this"},"2115":{"dur":1,"text":"pricing works."},"2117":{"dur":2,"text":"And they usually have\nlong FAQ documents."},"2119":{"dur":2,"text":"That's usually the first sign\nthat this pricing is super"},"2122":{"dur":1,"text":"complicated."},"2123":{"dur":4,"text":"So what we did was try to\nsimplify it all, and try to"},"2128":{"dur":2,"text":"figure out how we can make\nit better for both micro"},"2131":{"dur":3,"text":"transactions and large\ntransactions, and just have"},"2134":{"dur":3,"text":"one price structure that\nworks for everybody."},"2137":{"dur":4,"text":"So today, we want to announce\na new rate."},"2142":{"dur":5,"text":"And that's 5%, or\n1.9% plus $0.30."},"2148":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll repeat

change."},"2160":{"dur":1,"text":"What's different about\nthis rate?"},"2161":{"dur":5,"text":"What's different is Google will\nautomatically apply the"},"2167":{"dur":2,"text":"lowest fees for
