way."},"68":{"dur":5,"text":"I went to school, I went to university and\npretty much after that"},"73":{"dur":5,"text":"I went into a typical corporate consulting\nbackground, and started with that."},"80":{"dur":2,"text":"In some ways I didn't really\nthink about what I wanted to do."},"83":{"dur":1,"text":"I was just there."},"84":{"dur":4,"text":"That was kind of the thing that everyone\nwas doing and I just went along that path."},"89":{"dur":3,"text":"And I started with BCG in Munich."},"93":{"dur":3,"text":"But relatively soon I was like okay,\nI've done this and now in Germany."},"96":{"dur":3,"text":"That's where I'm from in\ncase anyone was wondering."},"99":{"dur":4,"text":"And then I said hm,\nwhat can be my next step."},"104":{"dur":2,"text":"Back then I hadn't heard\nabout social business yet."},"106":{"dur":2,"text":"Hadn't heard about microfinance,\nnone of that."},"108":{"dur":2,"text":"But I said, okay,\nwhy don't I go to New

out?"},"119":{"dur":3,"text":"So I transferred with NBCG,\nwent to New York,"},"122":{"dur":4,"text":"started consulting some\nconsumer goods companies here."},"127":{"dur":4,"text":"But relatively soon I again had that\nfeeling similar to what I had in Germany,"},"132":{"dur":0,"text":"What am I gonna do?"},"134":{"dur":6,"text":"And relatively quickly I actually started\nasking myself why am I

wasn't old enough yet."},"179":{"dur":3,"text":"And I was just asking myself,\nmy God what am I gonna do?"},"183":{"dur":3,"text":"And I guess I also noticed\nrelatively clearly that I was"},"187":{"dur":3,"text":"part of this specific generation,\nthis Generation Y."},"191":{"dur":3,"text":"That do not only believe\nin their own career, but"},"194":{"dur":2,"text":"that also wanna

me."},"203":{"dur":3,"text":"So you probably all belong to the\nmillennial generation that anyway totally"},"206":{"dur":3,"text":"has that completely ingrained in your

process I kind of\nstarted doing some research because"},"228":{"dur":5,"text":"I have been very lucky I grew\nup in a nice little neighborhood"},"233":{"dur":1,"text":"outside of Frankfurt in Germany."},"236":{"dur":3,"text":"I had wonderful parents, my mother being\nCanadian, my father being German so"},"240":{"dur":4,"text":"I was in that sense totally\nprivileged in terms of my passports,"},"244":{"dur":1,"text":"in terms of the education\nI was allowed to do,"},"246":{"dur":4,"text":"in terms of the healthcare that I just\nbasically had for free at my doorstep."},"250":{"dur":3,"text":"And I started doing some\nresearch about the world, and"},"254":{"dur":4,"text":"realized that what I had was\ncertainly not at all normal."},"259":{"dur":4,"text":"And so what I found out there, which also\nagain, you guys as millennials nowadays,"},"263":{"dur":2,"text":"probably completely know Was that"},"266":{"dur":4,"text":"half of the world's wealth is\nwith 1% of the population."},"270":{"dur":4,"text":"And the other half of that\nwealth is with the other 99%."},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I was like, that's crazy,"},"278":{"dur":4,"text":"what kind of a system have we built\nup that that is actually true?"},"283":{"dur":3,"text":"And of course you guys all living in\nNew York, this is a city of extremes."},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"You have many of those\n1% living right here."},"290":{"dur":3,"text":"You probably all know\nmany of those 1% and, and"},"294":{"dur":4,"text":"so that other side is important to keep\nin mind as well because sometimes we're"},"298":{"dur":3,"text":"sipping our latte and\ncompletely forget about those other 50%."},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's what I learned back then, and"},"304":{"dur":3,"text":"that was a pretty shocking revelation for\nme."},"308":{"dur":3,"text":"I was like oh my God,\nhow are we gonna change this inequality?"},"311":{"dur":1,"text":"Again, having no clue."},"312":{"dur":2,"text":"Still sitting here in New York."},"315":{"dur":3,"text":"And then I heard about these\nmillennium development goals."},"318":{"dur":1,"text":"Have you guys heard about them?"},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"Who has heard about\nthe millennium development goals?"},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, totally educated obviously."},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"Not surprising here at\nColumbia Business School."},"327":{"dur":4,"text":"So, and I heard about these eight goals,\nand I was like, whoa okay,"},"331":{"dur":4,"text":"so the world has come together\nbehind these eight goals, and"},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"the major kinda top line\nis to half poverty by 2015."},"339":{"dur":3,"text":"And I heard about that and\nI was like okay, thank God."},"342":{"dur":3,"text":"There is at least some kind\nof a plan in place it seems."},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"And actually to be honest,\nI have to say now, in 2015,"},"349":{"dur":3,"text":"this is the year when\nthey're supposed to end."},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"And the world has made significant and\ngood progress."},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"There's still some areas where\nthe eight goals have not been reached."},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"But it has, it definitely has\nbeen going in a good direction."},"361":{"dur":4,"text":"So I had realized I had won the lottery,\nand, of life,"},"365":{"dur":3,"text":"clearly, with what I was just explaining."},"368":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I thought maybe there's\nsomething that I can do."},"373":{"dur":4,"text":"I was just talking about those goals\nthat had come together in 2000,"},"378":{"dur":3,"text":"and then that were supposed\nto be ending this year."},"382":{"dur":4,"text":"And there was a little bit of a dip\nin attention for those goals."},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"And that was around 2007, 2008."},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"When the financial crisis hit."},"391":{"dur":1,"text":"Markets were falling."},"394":{"dur":3,"text":"Corporates and banks were going bust."},"397":{"dur":1,"text":"The whole world economy was slumping."},"399":{"dur":4,"text":"And suddenly, nobody really cared about\nthose millennium development goals anymore"},"403":{"dur":3,"text":"and a lot of attention was\nreally lost back then."},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"And back then,\nalso me business school background,"},"409":{"dur":3,"text":"working in corporate consulting,\nI had thought that actually"},"413":{"dur":4,"text":"business would be a great contributor\nto those millennium development goals."},"417":{"dur":3,"text":"But suddenly this whole system\nthat we had though was one that"},"421":{"dur":4,"text":"could potentially also help was\nall crumbling and falling apart."},"425":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'm look ew okay, capitalism is\nobviously not gonna solve it cuz"},"429":{"dur":3,"text":"they've actually created this system and\nthey're not contributing because right now"},"433":{"dur":3,"text":"there's a financial crisis and they\ncouldn't care less about other people."},"436":{"dur":4,"text":"And so they say who's now going to help\nachieve those millennium development goals"},"440":{"dur":3,"text":"Then I was like, okay,\ncan governments do anything?"},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"Well here in the US that's certainly not\na solution that you probably believe in,"},"448":{"dur":0,"text":"in that sense."},"451":{"dur":1,"text":"And let's look at it,"},"452":{"dur":3,"text":"and after the financial crisis\nthe sovereign debt crisis hit, and"},"456":{"dur":3,"text":"particularly in Europe, where I'm from,\nwe're still battling with some of that."},"460":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean still until now we've been\nworking on the bailout of Greece and"},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"other governments."},"465":{"dur":3,"text":"So that institution suddenly\ndidn't really work anymore."},"468":{"dur":3,"text":"And I was like, so, who's gonna\nactually help achieve those goals and"},"472":{"dur":4,"text":"who's actually gonna help stop that\ninequality that we see all around us?"},"476":{"dur":3,"text":"So I was like, okay,\nnot capitalism, not governments."},"479":{"dur":4,"text":"NGO sector, maybe, but also there I didn't\nreally see how that was gonna work."},"484":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I figured out,\nit probably has to be individuals."},"488":{"dur":4,"text":"It has to be every individual one of us\nthat just takes their own initiative and"},"493":{"dur":1,"text":"goes and tries something out."},"495":{"dur":4,"text":"And with all of this backdrop and things\nthat I had in mind at that stage in this"},"500":{"dur":3,"text":"kind of transition period\nthat I That I was."},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"I just said, okay,\nyou know what, I'll go London."},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"I'll move there,\nI'll spend a luxury year and"},"509":{"dur":4,"text":"study, do another Masters\nabout International Relations."},"513":{"dur":5,"text":"And with all that backdrop at LSE I\nheard this guy speak, Muhammad Yunus."},"520":{"dur":0,"text":"Who knows him?"},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay.\n[LAUGH] I'm giving up."},"524":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't need to ask anymore questions."},"526":{"dur":5,"text":"[LAUGH] So, I heard them speak,\nand I was just blown away."},"533":{"dur":3,"text":"He was standing up there and\nhe was telling story."},"536":{"dur":3,"text":"And I just thought, wow,\nthat's one individual and"},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"he's actually managed\nto do all this things."},"544":{"dur":3,"text":"Maybe with my small skill set that\nI have I can do something too."},"548":{"dur":3,"text":"And most people probably\nknow him from Microcredit."},"552":{"dur":4,"text":"That's what he's known for, that's\nwhat he won the Peace Noble Prize for."},"557":{"dur":4,"text":"That's for what he has I don't know\n47 honorary doctorates at different"},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"universities around the world, but\nI don't know what other things he's won."},"566":{"dur":4,"text":"But he started talking, also,\nabout this new concept of social business."},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's something that I\nhadn't really heard about before."},"574":{"dur":3,"text":"I knew about micro-finance, and\nI thought that was a cool thing."},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"But I didn't really know about this\nconceptualization of social business."},"581":{"dur":5,"text":"And what I was very impressed of was\nthat this institution of business"},"587":{"dur":3,"text":"that I believed in,\nthat I had a background in, and"},"590":{"dur":5,"text":"that I have learned, was completely only\nfocused on shareholder value maximization,"},"596":{"dur":4,"text":"suddenly could also be used for\nnot shareholder value maximization,"},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"but to solve simple problems."},"603":{"dur":6,"text":"Of humanity, of environments, of the world\nas a whole, and that really impressed me."},"610":{"dur":3,"text":"And the thing was that this guy, Yunus,"},"613":{"dur":4,"text":"he was not just a person that had\ncome up beautiful theories, and"},"618":{"dur":4,"text":"was a nice professor coming up with\nthem and writing them on paper."},"622":{"dur":4,"text":"But he had been a practitioner,\nand he had gotten this done."},"627":{"dur":6,"text":"And he had implemented social business\nat large scale in Bangladesh."},"633":{"dur":5,"text":"And Bangladesh is certainly not an easy\ncountry to start something like this in,"},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"and he had managed to do this."},"640":{"dur":3,"text":"And here you go with a few examples of"},"644":{"dur":4,"text":"some of those businesses that were created\nover the last 30 years in Bangladesh."},"648":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll just give you a few examples."},"649":{"dur":4,"text":"For example, next to the lack of\naccess to finance that people have in"},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"rural Bangladesh, they also don't\nreally have access to healthcare."},"658":{"dur":3,"text":"So, you said okay, let's try and\nbuild some clinics but"},"662":{"dur":4,"text":"build some clinics not in a way that you,\nget a donation, build a clinic, and"},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"then provide healthcare for free."},"669":{"dur":5,"text":"But a clinic that charges very small\namounts so everyone can still pay for"},"674":{"dur":3,"text":"it but that, again,\nfunctions financially self-sustainable,"},"678":{"dur":4,"text":"recoups its costs and, again,\ntherefore, grow on its own steam."},"682":{"dur":4,"text":"Same thing was they don't have access\nto electricity in rural Bangladesh."},"686":{"dur":4,"text":"It's not like here where you just plug in\nyour cell phone and then it's loading."},"691":{"dur":1,"text":"There are no plugs."},"693":{"dur":1,"text":"You all know this as well."},"695":{"dur":1,"text":"So how do you find a solution?"},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"There's no grid."},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"What do you do?"},"699":{"dur":1,"text":"So in the mid-90s,"},"700":{"dur":4,"text":"they said in Bangladesh, well,\nwhy don't we sell the people solar panels?"},"706":{"dur":6,"text":"In the mid 90s solar panels were quite\na radical idea because certainly,"},"712":{"dur":3,"text":"neither in the US nor in Europe,\nthat was like a big thing."},"716":{"dur":3,"text":"And solar power even now a days is not"},"719":{"dur":3,"text":"really a strong proportion\nof our energy mix."},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"And they just started selling those."},"724":{"dur":4,"text":"And Grameen Shakti now is actually\none of the largest solar home system"},"729":{"dur":1,"text":"providers in the world."},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"Not just in Bangladesh, but in the world."},"732":{"dur":4,"text":"They've sold over one and a half million\nsolar home systems to individual homes,"},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"at a low price, so people can afford it."},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"They don't have to pay for\nkerosene anymore and again,"},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"the whole thing functions as a business."},"745":{"dur":3,"text":"That's just another example,\nmaybe I'll throw a third one in there too."},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"Also in the mid 90's,\nalso quite radical, and"},"752":{"dur":4,"text":"people didn't really have phones, cell\nphones especially not in rural Bangladesh."},"756":{"dur":5,"text":"Even in the mid 90's I didn't have\na phone in good old Germany, so"},"762":{"dur":4,"text":"he just started saying why don't we\nstart selling people cellphones so"},"766":{"dur":1,"text":"they can actually\ncommunicate with each other?"},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"So they can actually find out when they\nwant to sell lets say their potatoes"},"772":{"dur":1,"text":"in the next village."},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"What the price in the next village is."},"776":{"dur":1,"text":"They can just call their\nfriend in another village."},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"And suddenly they have this\nmarket transparency and"},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"they suddenly have the power\nof information in their hands."},"783":{"dur":1,"text":"Why don't we do that?"},"784":{"dur":3,"text":"They did it, okay another success story."},"788":{"dur":4,"text":"Grameen Phone is now the largest\ncompany in Bangladesh."},"792":{"dur":4,"text":"It's the largest tax-payer,\nit has around 50% market share."},"797":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's a gigantic business."},"799":{"dur":5,"text":"But again, it was not created to to make\nmoney for Yunus or Grameen or anyone."},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"It was created to solve that problem so\npeople have access to information,"},"808":{"dur":3,"text":"can communicate with each other,\nand are connected to the world."},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"And so these are just a few examples."},"816":{"dur":3,"text":"I think the word disruption,\nor game-changing,"},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"nowadays is pretty overused."},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"You probably are very aware of that."},"824":{"dur":3,"text":"But for me, those are examples\nthat are real game changers,"},"828":{"dur":3,"text":"that change the way life was for\npeople in Bangladesh."},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"And these are the types of businesses that\nwe're trying to support around the world"},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"as well."},"839":{"dur":3,"text":"So let me just clarify what we\nmean with social business and"},"843":{"dur":4,"text":"again for you guys its pretty clear,\nbut just to put it in a nutshell."},"847":{"dur":6,"text":"It really has created out of the intention\nof a solving specific social problem,"},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"but it does run fully\nfinancial self sustainable."},"856":{"dur":4,"text":"It can completely run on it's own steam\nIt can repay the initial capital and"},"861":{"dur":3,"text":"it reinvests the money\ninto the specific mission."},"864":{"dur":3,"text":"So, in some ways, and I know that\nthis is completely over the top."},"868":{"dur":5,"text":"But I'm allowed to say this because I come\nfrom that side of the business world."},"873":{"dur":4,"text":"In some ways, typical business has\nbeen concentrated on one thing."},"878":{"dur":4,"text":"They've been kind of trained, just like\nthat dog has been trained to bite,"},"883":{"dur":4,"text":"and normal business has\nbeen trained to bite or"},"888":{"dur":5,"text":"get money out of the system and\ngive money to their shareholders."},"893":{"dur":5,"text":"But then why can you not take that exact\nsame machine, that efficiency machine,"},"899":{"dur":4,"text":"that machine that is driving us in\nthe world, that machine called business."},"904":{"dur":3,"text":"But changed the DNA slightly,\nso let's say,"},"907":{"dur":6,"text":"genetically modify that thing called\nbusiness and suddenly say, you know what?"},"913":{"dur":2,"text":"Do the same thing, but\nyour goal is suddenly a different one."},"916":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not shareholder value maximization."},"918":{"dur":3,"text":"It's actually solving\na problem in your community."},"921":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's where you see that same dog."},"923":{"dur":3,"text":"He's also programmed it a different way\nand he's a, I don't even know what you"},"927":{"dur":3,"text":"call that in English,\na blinds dog or something like that."},"930":{"dur":2,"text":"He's helping a blind guy to walk\naround and it's the same dog,"},"933":{"dur":2,"text":"but he's serving a different purpose."},"936":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's what I found fascinating."},"938":{"dur":2,"text":"And so\nobviously as you know I got involved."},"941":{"dur":1,"text":"After the speech I walked up to Yunus,"},"942":{"dur":4,"text":"I was like my My name is here's my\nbusiness card, can we work together?"},"948":{"dur":2,"text":"And he said, sure, who are you?"},"950":{"dur":0,"text":"Here's my card."},"951":{"dur":3,"text":"And we started emailing\nrelatively quickly,"},"955":{"dur":3,"text":"I then started going to Bangladesh."},"958":{"dur":3,"text":"Because I just thought, okay, I have\nto go to where this guy is from, and"},"962":{"dur":2,"text":"see what he's actually done in reality."},"964":{"dur":1,"text":"I said bye bye to BCG."},"966":{"dur":7,"text":"Flew to Bangladesh and then said, is there\na way that I can use my current skills?"},"973":{"dur":3,"text":"And I started calling up\nmy former clients at PCG,"},"977":{"dur":1,"text":"started partnering up\nwith another partner."},"980":{"dur":4,"text":"And we started creating\ncompanies together."},"985":{"dur":4,"text":"So companies that were founded in\npartnership between Grameen and"},"989":{"dur":3,"text":"Unis and Bangladesh, but also some of\nthe corporates that I used to work for."},"993":{"dur":4,"text":"And so one of them, for example,\nwas the joint venture with BASF."},"998":{"dur":3,"text":"BASF, as you might know, is Is the largest\nchemical company in the world."},"1001":{"dur":2,"text":"So first of all, you think like, ugh."},"1003":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe a scary company to work with."},"1006":{"dur":5,"text":"But they said, hey, we want to use also\nour skills to do something for society."},"1011":{"dur":4,"text":"So what we did is,\nwe created a company that produces and"},"1015":{"dur":4,"text":"sells mosquito nets that are treated\nwith a certain insecticide."},"1020":{"dur":4,"text":"And to be able to combat malaria, dengue\nfever and other insect-borne diseases."},"1024":{"dur":3,"text":"And that company was created and\nit's still running."},"1028":{"dur":3,"text":"It produces about 3,000 nets a day and\nsells it throughout Bangladesh."},"1031":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's just one example,\nbut there were many others."},"1034":{"dur":4,"text":"We created another one with Veolia\nwhich is a French utility company"},"1038":{"dur":2,"text":"to make sure that people had safe\ndrinking water in Bangladesh."},"1041":{"dur":1,"text":"In Bangladesh, again,"},"1043":{"dur":4,"text":"the water is contaminated with arsenic,\nthe groundwater."},"1047":{"dur":4,"text":"And the surface water is contaminated just\nwith germs so people get diarrhea, etc."},"1051":{"dur":5,"text":"Grameen Veolia makes clean water so\npeople have access to it, and sells it."},"1056":{"dur":2,"text":"Again, it's not a charity,\nit's a business."},"1059":{"dur":2,"text":"So just a few of those\nexamples that we then created."},"1063":{"dur":2,"text":"So all of that was then\nfocused on Bangladesh."},"1066":{"dur":3,"text":"So then I said, the world is big and"},"1069":{"dur":4,"text":"he's obviously is traveling\naround the world everyday."},"1073":{"dur":3,"text":"Obviously he knew that very well, and\nI said why don't we try and see if"},"1077":{"dur":4,"text":"we can replicate that success that you've\nhad in Bangladesh in other countries."},"1082":{"dur":4,"text":"Because there's so much need in the world,\nwhy don't we try and do that?"},"1087":{"dur":1,"text":"And he said sure, why not?"},"1089":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's try.\nAs crazy as he was,"},"1091":{"dur":1,"text":"the entrepreneur that he was, he agreed."},"1092":{"dur":4,"text":"So we co-founded Unis Social Business\nGlobal Initiatives in 2011 and"},"1098":{"dur":4,"text":"now we have expanded, whoops no."},"1103":{"dur":1,"text":"There's one more thing I wanted to say."},"1105":{"dur":0,"text":"I just mentioned that."},"1106":{"dur":2,"text":"So, he was a game changer."},"1108":{"dur":2,"text":"How can we find game\nchangers around the world?"},"1111":{"dur":2,"text":"That's what we set out\nto do at that stage."},"1114":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't know know if we're 100% there yet,\nbut we're working on it."},"1116":{"dur":2,"text":"And you'll see a few examples."},"1119":{"dur":4,"text":"So, we expanded into seven regions now,\nactually

have supported over 500 entrepreneurs."},"1138":{"dur":4,"text":"And we have invested nowadays\ninto 30 social businesses,"},"1142":{"dur":3,"text":"in different areas\nranging from agriculture,"},"1146":{"dur":4,"text":"to education,\nto vocational training, you name it."},"1151":{"dur":2,"text":"Renewable energy, many,\nmany different areas."},"1154":{"dur":3,"text":"Those social businesses in turn, just\nthose 30 that we've actually financed,"},"1157":{"dur":3,"text":"because those are the ones where we can\nreally do the impact measurement properly."},"1161":{"dur":4,"text":"They've already served about 400,000\nclients with their products and services."},"1166":{"dur":5,"text":"They created around 10,000\njobs at this stage."},"1171":{"dur":4,"text":"So there's some significant impact and\nobviously this is just the beginning,"},"1175":{"dur":4,"text":"because those 30 businesses started\nfrom scratch or were very early stage."},"1180":{"dur":3,"text":"And as they're growing, each year\ntheir impact will obviously multiply."},"1183":{"dur":3,"text":"And we will additionally invest\nin additional companies."},"1186":{"dur":2,"text":"And so,\nthe impact will be growing every year."},"1188":{"dur":2,"text":"That's the power of business."},"1190":{"dur":3,"text":"So, how do we find those entrepreneurs?"},"1193":{"dur":3,"text":"There are really two ways how we\ndo that in all those countries."},"1197":{"dur":4,"text":"In all those countries we have people\non the grounds that do nothing else"},"1202":{"dur":4,"text":"than look for local entrepreneurs,\nand then pick them."},"1207":{"dur":2,"text":"Pick the ones that they find are the best."},"1209":{"dur":1,"text":"And they provide them with all of it,"},"1211":{"dur":4,"text":"let's say non financial support what we\ncall entrepreneur services that they need."},"1215":{"dur":4,"text":"Everything from helping them to\nfind clients to helping them to"},"1219":{"dur":4,"text":"I don't know be better in marketing or\nwhatever they might need."},"1224":{"dur":4,"text":"Connecting them to experts, connecting\nthem to mentors and then when we feel that"},"1228":{"dur":4,"text":"they are investment ready then we also\nprovide the necessary financing, so"},"1232":{"dur":1,"text":"they can grow their businesses."},"1234":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's how we generally do that."},"1238":{"dur":3,"text":"Then, I'd like to share a few\nexamples with you, just so"},"1242":{"dur":4,"text":"you see a few stories and\nyou can imagine again what we mean"},"1246":{"dur":4,"text":"when we talk about social business,\nand what is also doable right now."},"1251":{"dur":2,"text":"We do focus, as I said,\non early stage social businesses."},"1254":{"dur":4,"text":"So we're not looking for somebody that\nhas been in operation for 10, 15 years."},"1258":{"dur":3,"text":"But we're trying to actually find those\nguys that are really starting off, that"},"1262":{"dur":5,"text":"have maybe created some early revenue,\nbut that we still need help to grow."},"1267":{"dur":3,"text":"Because we see that's where\nthe largest gap in the market is."},"1271":{"dur":5,"text":"There are banks that can finance\norganizations that are much more advanced."},"1276":{"dur":5,"text":"And also other impact investors can\ncome in with higher investments."},"1282":{"dur":3,"text":"So we've actually picked that\nspecific so-called missing middle."},"1286":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is, for example,\none of my heroes, Robert."},"1290":{"dur":2,"text":"He's a guy from Northern Uganda, and"},"1294":{"dur":5,"text":"Northern Uganda obviously was hit by\ncivil strife for many, many years."},"1299":{"dur":2,"text":"The Lord's Resistance Army\nwas quite terrible and"},"1302":{"dur":2,"text":"devastating that Northern Ugandan region."},"1304":{"dur":4,"text":"And so the region is pretty much\ndeprived of any economic opportunity."},"1309":{"dur":6,"text":"And Robert was from there and he said,\nI wanna do something for my area."},"1315":{"dur":2,"text":"I wanna make sure that we\nhave economic growth here."},"1318":{"dur":4,"text":"And so he just started off with\nsomething very, very simple."},"1322":{"dur":4,"text":"He started producing honey for himself,\nthen realize that that's quite easy."},"1327":{"dur":4,"text":"Then he got a few unemployed\nyoung guys around him and said,"},"1331":{"dur":5,"text":"why don't you produce honey with me and\nI'll help sell it."},"1336":{"dur":5,"text":"And now, just after a few years he\nalready has created jobs and income for"},"1344":{"dur":6,"text":"around 5,000 formerly unemployed youth in\nthat area, and the business is growing."},"1350":{"dur":3,"text":"And he's created this honey brand called,"},"1354":{"dur":5,"text":"that he's now been selling both in\nthe Kampala area, in the capitol city,"},"1359":{"dur":4,"text":"but is now also been starting\nto export it to the Netherlands."},"1364":{"dur":2,"text":"That has been his first market,\nmaybe, hopefully, also to the US."},"1367":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe you are honey buyers, who knows."},"1370":{"dur":5,"text":"With every single jar of honey that\nhe's selling he's obviously able to hire"},"1376":{"dur":3,"text":"more people and get more people involved\nand make sure that they have a future."},"1379":{"dur":2,"text":"So he's one of those guys\nthat really started small but"},"1382":{"dur":1,"text":"said I wanna do something for my region."},"1384":{"dur":1,"text":"Already now just after two or\nthree years or"},"1386":{"dur":4,"text":"so he has these 5,000 people that\nhe's created an opportunity for."},"1392":{"dur":3,"text":"The funny thing is actually\na few children, I think three or"},"1395":{"dur":3,"text":"four children in northern\nUganda were born."},"1399":{"dur":4,"text":"And the parents called their kid because\nthey loved his business so much."},"1403":{"dur":4,"text":"So there are babies out there already."},"1407":{"dur":5,"text":"I would call that a game changer,\nthat child has that name forever."},"1413":{"dur":2,"text":"[LAUGH] So,\nanother example from Uganda, again,"},"1416":{"dur":1,"text":"we talked about the water issue earlier."},"1419":{"dur":3,"text":"There are several millions of people\nthat don't have access to fresh water."},"1422":{"dur":3,"text":"This entrepreneur said I want to make sure\nthat particularly kids have access to"},"1426":{"dur":3,"text":"fresh water so they can stay healthy and\ncan grow as they're supposed to."},"1429":{"dur":3,"text":"He said where can I reach\nthe most kids in school?"},"1433":{"dur":6,"text":"And so he said, okay why don't I sell\nthem solar water cleaning systems and"},"1439":{"dur":5,"text":"the school can buy those,\npay them off over about 18 months and"},"1444":{"dur":3,"text":"can provide clean drinking\nwater to the kids."},"1448":{"dur":2,"text":"Every single day up until now."},"1450":{"dur":3,"text":"They did have water at the schools,\nbut they had to boil it every day."},"1454":{"dur":2,"text":"So they had to chop down trees, boil it."},"1457":{"dur":2,"text":"Sometimes it wasn't properly boiled,\nso the kids got sick."},"1459":{"dur":2,"text":"Sometimes it was boiled, but\nthen you were killing the trees."},"1462":{"dur":3,"text":"So, the solution was really sub-optimal."},"1465":{"dur":1,"text":"And now they've been doing this."},"1467":{"dur":7,"text":"They've been selling these systems\njust in the last year to 500 schools"},"1475":{"dur":4,"text":"that have reached 250,000 kids already,\nso again, it's just the starting point."},"1479":{"dur":3,"text":"And this will be multiplied\nbecause the power of business"},"1482":{"dur":5,"text":"allows things to be scaled, and\nto be brought to many more people."},"1488":{"dur":5,"text":"And just another example, here, Columbia,\nhealthcare is an issue, typical problem."},"1493":{"dur":2,"text":"And this entrepreneur was a young doctor."},"1495":{"dur":3,"text":"And he just came to us and said,\nhey, I wanna do something for"},"1499":{"dur":3,"text":"the Colombian healthcare system."},"1502":{"dur":4,"text":"And he created this business called\nBIVE which nowadays serves 15,000"},"1507":{"dur":4,"text":"people already and has sold them\na very small, simple membership"},"1511":{"dur":4,"text":"card which is like a mini insurance and\nthey get access to medication for"},"1516":{"dur":3,"text":"much less money and\nthey also get healthcare check ups."},"1520":{"dur":1,"text":"So again, it works."},"1521":{"dur":3,"text":"It's financially self sustainable,\nit's expanding."},"1524":{"dur":4,"text":"And I'll make a final example,\nwe also again"},"1528":{"dur":5,"text":"now created a joint venture with\nthe corporation and you guys know McCain?"},"1533":{"dur":4,"text":"McCain is this company that sells\nfrench fries and their from Canada."},"1537":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you ever been at McDonald's\nthose are french fries from McCain so"},"1541":{"dur":1,"text":"their big you can imagine."},"1544":{"dur":4,"text":"And they said, well the farmers in our\nvalue chain are not making enough money."},"1548":{"dur":2,"text":"And we said, yes that's true,\nlet's do something about it."},"1551":{"dur":4,"text":"So we then created a giant venture\nthat on the one hand trains farmers so"},"1555":{"dur":3,"text":"they know how to actually\nhave higher yields, and"},"1558":{"dur":4,"text":"on the other hand buys from them and\nmake sure that they,"},"1563":{"dur":4,"text":"in bulk, can sell their potatoes, and\ntherefore, have much higher incomes."},"1568":{"dur":5,"text":"Again, just in the first pilot, they\nimprove the income of those people by 50%."},"1573":{"dur":4,"text":"So those are just a few examples\nof how businesses can start and"},"1578":{"dur":1,"text":"will have a potential to grow."},"1580":{"dur":1,"text":"So I showed you a few examples,"},"1582":{"dur":3,"text":"and I told you a little bit the story what\nwe would do at Yunus Social Business."},"1586":{"dur":4,"text":"But I think the important thing is not\njust what we do or what Yunus has done or"},"1590":{"dur":4,"text":"what some of our entrepreneurs have done,\nbut really, what do you guys want?"},"1594":{"dur":3,"text":"And maybe you can do this little\nexercise for me for one second."},"1598":{"dur":3,"text":"Close your eyes for one second,\ndo me the favor, and"},"1602":{"dur":4,"text":"imagine what the world should\nlook like that you wanna live in."},"1618":{"dur":1,"text":"Good."},"1619":{"dur":2,"text":"I hope you've come up with something."},"1621":{"dur":3,"text":"Keep that in mind, keep that in mind and"},"1625":{"dur":4,"text":"now what I'll say is those\nentrepreneurs the guy"},"1630":{"dur":4,"text":"called Yunus they've had that imagination."},"1635":{"dur":3,"text":"They knew what they wanted to do or let's\nsay they knew where they wanted to go but"},"1639":{"dur":2,"text":"they really didn't know how to get there."},"1642":{"dur":3,"text":"So a friend of mine,\nReed Hoffman, actually said"},"1645":{"dur":4,"text":"entrepreneurs jump off a cliff and\nthey'll build their wings on the way down."},"1650":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's probably gonna be the same\nway how it's gonna be for you guys."},"1653":{"dur":1,"text":"You know where you wanna go."},"1655":{"dur":4,"text":"You don't know how you're gonna get there\nyet, but you'll find out on the way down."},"1660":{"dur":3,"text":"And the world has actually\ndone that same thing."},"1663":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't know if they closed their eyes."},"1665":{"dur":1,"text":"They actually talked to many, many people."},"1668":{"dur":3,"text":"The millennium development goals\nwe just discussed obviously"},"1672":{"dur":5,"text":"actually today the so-called global\ngoals or sustainable development goals"},"1677":{"dur":5,"text":"are going to be launched And\nthese are a set of 17 goals."},"1683":{"dur":4,"text":"The top line is really that they wanna\ncompletely end poverty and

eyes,"},"1694":{"dur":1,"text":"come to those 17 goals."},"1696":{"dur":1,"text":"They will be launched today."},"1697":{"dur":5,"text":"So they've imagined what our future's\nsupposed to look like in In 15 years,"},"1703":{"dur":1,"text":"so in 2030."},"1704":{"dur":2,"text":"But the question is now,\nhow do we get there?"},"1707":{"dur":2,"text":"And that is where I'm\nlooking at all of you."},"1712":{"dur":1,"text":"You've just closed your eyes."},"1713":{"dur":2,"text":"You've imagined what\nyour future looks like."},"1715":{"dur":2,"text":"But some of you might think,\nwhat can I do?"},"1717":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm just an individual."},"1719":{"dur":2,"text":"The problems of the world are so big."},"1721":{"dur":0,"text":"What can I really do?"},"1723":{"dur":0,"text":"But in the end, and"},"1724":{"dur":4,"text":"you know that already, you are the most\npowerful generation in the world."},"1730":{"dur":4,"text":"Even when I grew up, I didn't have access\nto a cell phone

power\nat the tip of your fingers."},"1754":{"dur":3,"text":"And so you are the most powerful\ngeneration in the world."},"1757":{"dur":4,"text":"So if you can't do it, then who can?"},"1762":{"dur":5,"text":"And we have these 15 years to achieve\nthose goals of no poverty, no hunger."},"1769":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's a very clear and\nfinite deadline."},"1772":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think we can achieve it if all\nof us actually say we want to do it."},"1776":{"dur":2,"text":"And we're gonna put our power\ninto doing exactly that."},"1780":{"dur":5,"text":"And not just for the social goals,\nbut also for the environmental goals."},"1786":{"dur":3,"text":"It's very important that we actually\nact now because especially for"},"1790":{"dur":4,"text":"the climate change side of things,\nthe window of opportunity is also closing."},"1794":{"dur":3,"text":"We will not be able to achieve the goals\nif we don't start

now."},"1806":{"dur":1,"text":"So your action is required now."},"1809":{"dur":5,"text":"So in other words, it's up to you now and\nthe question is how you go about it."},"1815":{"dur":3,"text":"There are many, many ways and\nI'm sure you're creative so"},"1818":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll really leave it up to you,"},"1819":{"dur":5,"text":"but you could create your own business,\nyou can start your own
