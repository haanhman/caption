a market and sell it."},"227":{"dur":6,"text":"So they have a much more lengthy gameplay\nbut it should be fun for them to be able to"},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"see what they are taking and

geometry to get a better idea of how\nit all works."},"407":{"dur":5,"text":"And then on this particular one because the\nspace was so tight I also animated as I was"},"412":{"dur":5,"text":"going

cool!"},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"PM: And to give us a more in depth look at\nwhat it took to hatch the Dragonfly, let\u2019s"},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"go to Paul Jones and his team"},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"Ship Shape: Dragonfly"},"539":{"dur":8,"text":"Paul Jones (PJ):: So the Dragonfly was basically\na new category of vehicle for Star

bigger."},"556":{"dur":8,"text":"And that was working for the universe but\nnow with 3 \u2026 well 3.0 coming up and us going"},"564":{"dur":6,"text":"planetside - which we\u2019ve just shown in the\ndemo - Chris was really pushing for a personal"},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"vehicle."},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"Essentially a space motorcycle."},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"Like a space hog."},"576":{"dur":7,"text":"And so with that in mind the Drake Dragonfly\nis the perfect candidate because it\u2019s styling"},"584":{"dur":3,"text":"is a little bit \u2026 it\u2019s a little bit low\nbrow, it\u2019s quite mechanically."},"588":{"dur":3,"text":"Especially we\u2019d just been dealing with the\nCaterpillar."},"591":{"dur":5,"text":"And so we worked with those requirements and\nthe Design team, with their brief that they"},"597":{"dur":6,"text":"gave us: they want something small, something\nthat can hover above land, something that"},"604":{"dur":5,"text":"can also fly in space, so you can just boot\nit out of your Freelancer."},"609":{"dur":1,"text":"And so this was a lot of fun."},"610":{"dur":4,"text":"So this was a brand new \u2026 again it was like\ncarte blanche almost."},"614":{"dur":6,"text":"And so this is always what us art guys want;\nwhat the concept guys want."},"621":{"dur":5,"text":"So you\u2019ll see today through the process\nhow we\u2019ve developed it."},"626":{"dur":6,"text":"Gary Sanchez (GS): The ship it was interesting\nto design first because it\u2019s small."},"632":{"dur":8,"text":"It\u2019s allowed go everywhere on ground, on\nplanet, and we can also go in space with it"},"640":{"dur":9,"text":"so we have different functionality contrary\nto some other ship that are bigger or different."},"650":{"dur":6,"text":"So the Drake manufacturer is also interesting\nbecause of this kind of low tech industrial"},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"look."},"657":{"dur":9,"text":"So it was also a challenge to try to do something\niconic but with a ... not too design a bike."},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"So it was very interesting to do."},"669":{"dur":6,"text":"Joe Neville (JN): So the Dragonfly was challenging\nat times purely because there are so many"},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"expose components to it."},"678":{"dur":5,"text":"It basically means that the \u2026 it was a lot\nmore expensive as an asset."},"683":{"dur":4,"text":"With a lot of the bigger ships you can hide\ncomponents away whereas with the Dragonfly"},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"everything is exposed."},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"You have to model everything."},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"There\u2019s no smoke and mirrors here."},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"Steve Turberfield (ST): Essentially when I\nget given the model from the guys in the Art"},"695":{"dur":5,"text":"team, my job is essentially to start breaking\nthat down into the separate items, such as"},"701":{"dur":4,"text":"the thrusters, and all the general parts of\nthe ship itself, such as the nose, the body,"},"705":{"dur":4,"text":"and beginning to break them \u2026 make them\ndetachable and add damage effects and things"},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"like that."},"711":{"dur":4,"text":"Overall we begin just by doing a real rough\nwhitebox flyable state on it."},"716":{"dur":4,"text":"So we\u2019ll just get the model flying before\nwe start breaking it all up."},"720":{"dur":5,"text":"In the Gamescom demo we essentially showed\noff the basic setup of the ground mode and"},"725":{"dur":6,"text":"also the spaceflight mode, where we were essentially\nshowing it going off in space, landing inside"},"732":{"dur":4,"text":"the Freelancer, going planetside, getting\nout again and being useable in its ground"},"736":{"dur":1,"text":"mode."},"738":{"dur":4,"text":"We have a lot more to add to that so we\u2019re\ndoing further work on the ground mode flight"},"743":{"dur":3,"text":"systems - just really tweaking it, making\nsure that it feels spot on when you are riding"},"746":{"dur":1,"text":"on the planet."},"747":{"dur":4,"text":"In addition we also need to set up the rear\nseat for a rear facing passenger."},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"So you will essentially have your buddy on\nthe back, running along with you and we are"},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"eventually going to implement them being able\nto hold a weapons."},"759":{"dur":4,"text":"So while you are in any chase sequences or\nmodes you\u2019re essentially able to have your"},"763":{"dur":3,"text":"guy at the back shooting people off who are\napproaching from behind."},"767":{"dur":3,"text":"And the final thing that we are looking to\nimplement is a third mode that the Dragonfly"},"771":{"dur":5,"text":"has which is a compact mode where essentially\nthe ship nacelles retract and it basically"},"776":{"dur":5,"text":"enables you to store it in it\u2019s smallest\npossible state on any of your cargo ships."},"781":{"dur":5,"text":"Darren Lambourne (DL): I went with Harley\nDavidson for the kickstart sound, originally,"},"787":{"dur":3,"text":"which was heavily processed obviously to just\nget that \u201cbah-dah-dah-dum\u201d coming \u2026 okay"},"791":{"dur":3,"text":"you know it\u2019s a motorbike but heavily processed."},"794":{"dur":6,"text":"And then it was a matter of finding out essentially\nwhat made motorbikes different from cars or"},"801":{"dur":1,"text":"spaceships or airplanes."},"802":{"dur":5,"text":"It\u2019s the connectedness with the environment:\nyou\u2019re racing along really near the floor."},"808":{"dur":5,"text":"So the ground rush, particles, rocks, anything\nlike that, that\u2019s going to hurt if you hit"},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"it hard enough and the wind rush and stuff."},"815":{"dur":4,"text":"I wanted to really to get all of that stuff\nin there for the Dragonfly."},"819":{"dur":6,"text":"So it was in stark contrast with the other\nships and vehicles we have in the game."},"826":{"dur":4,"text":"The planetside stuff, the in atmosphere flight,\nthe sort of terrain traversal in wheeled vehicles"},"830":{"dur":3,"text":"and hover vehicles like the Dragonfly\u2026"},"834":{"dur":4,"text":"I think provide a brilliant contrast between\nwhat we\u2019re used to, the sort of\u2026 the space"},"838":{"dur":5,"text":"travel aspect where you\u2019ve got points of\nsound very sharp contrasty points of sound,"},"844":{"dur":2,"text":"very clean in the void."},"846":{"dur":5,"text":"Then on planetside we\u2019ve got this much more\ngrounded\u2026 when there\u2019s an explosion it\u2019s"},"851":{"dur":5,"text":"going to echo around in canyons, you feel\nclose to the ground, you feel much like footsteps"},"856":{"dur":3,"text":"different surfaces\u2026 surface types and stuff\nyou\u2019re going to have to feel that through"},"860":{"dur":3,"text":"the vehicle and it just gives a\u2026"},"864":{"dur":6,"text":"I think it\u2019s a case of, you know, the total\nis great and the sum of the parts, really."},"870":{"dur":4,"text":"The space travel and the planetside stuff\nand those two things contrasting with each"},"875":{"dur":2,"text":"other I think sort of reinforcing each other."},"877":{"dur":8,"text":"So, it\u2019s kind of picking what we can emphasize\nlike the ground effect stuff, like echoey"},"885":{"dur":3,"text":"stuff off canyons and mountains and things\nlike that to give you a sense of where you"},"889":{"dur":4,"text":"are and the two things will provide a brilliant\nmuch, much enhanced experience I think to"},"894":{"dur":1,"text":"just space flight, you know"},"895":{"dur":3,"text":"ST: So, I can honestly say that the Drake\nDragonfly has
