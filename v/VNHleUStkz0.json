itself."},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"Some of these plans actually are counterproductive."},"668":{"dur":5,"text":"They take away tax preferences for new investments\nthat haven't been made, but not from

those, Eric."},"709":{"dur":5,"text":"Some of them say, let's tax U.S. chartered\ncompanies more heavily on their overseas profits"},"715":{"dur":4,"text":"so they won't have as much of an incentive\nto take investments abroad, but then as you've"},"719":{"dur":5,"text":"said, that just aggravates the problem of\nthe disincentive of being a U.S.

yeah."},"773":{"dur":4,"text":"Eric: So let me just talk a little bit about\nwhat those are and what's driven the impetus"},"778":{"dur":6,"text":"for some of these proposals and that is, because\nU.S. companies can shift profits to low tax"},"784":{"dur":7,"text":"countries to get tax savings and they've been\ndoing it more and because foreign countries"},"791":{"dur":5,"text":"have been lowering their tax rates, even in\nthe so-called high tax foreign countries...their"},"796":{"dur":4,"text":"rates are now below the U.S. rate and they've\nbeen falling over the last two

little foreign income tax."},"813":{"dur":3,"text":"So before if the profits had paid foreign\nincome tax, they could bring them back and"},"817":{"dur":6,"text":"get a foreign tax credit that would offset\nmuch of the U.S. income tax, but now the foreign"},"823":{"dur":2,"text":"tax credits are not going to be enough."},"826":{"dur":5,"text":"And so companies are stuck in the situation\nwhere their profits are locked out overseas."},"831":{"dur":6,"text":"They've accrued over 2 trillion of assets,\nU.S. companies have in overseas subsidiaries."},"837":{"dur":3,"text":"Now they're actually not really physically\noverseas."},"841":{"dur":4,"text":"They might be in U.S. banks, but they are\noverseas in the sense that what they can't"},"846":{"dur":6,"text":"do is use those profits for

are...this is a situation which\nhas caused a lot of disquiet and so what some"},"868":{"dur":6,"text":"of the reformers had said, \"Hey, if we're\ngoing to have a preference for foreign

repatriated."},"882":{"dur":5,"text":"Let's eliminate this repatriation tax and\nreplace it with two things."},"888":{"dur":4,"text":"The first thing is we're gonna say, there's\nall this money that companies have already"},"892":{"dur":3,"text":"accrued under the old rules and they expected\nto pay some tax."},"896":{"dur":6,"text":"We'll impose some low rate tax on the money\nthat they've had overseas, just a onetime"},"903":{"dur":2,"text":"tax on those accrued profits."},"906":{"dur":3,"text":"We'd let them pay it out over 10 years or\n8 years or 10 years so there's not too much"},"909":{"dur":1,"text":"of a sticker shock."},"911":{"dur":6,"text":"The second thing is going forward, we would\nactually take some of their profits from intangible"},"917":{"dur":6,"text":"assets and subject to current U.S. taxation...it's\nbeen called a minimum tax...at some low rate."},"924":{"dur":6,"text":"So they would continue to have their foreign\nincome preferentially taxed, but we wouldn't"},"930":{"dur":2,"text":"discourage them from bringing money back."},"933":{"dur":4,"text":"We would impose this tax at a low rate, whether\nthey bring the money back or not."},"937":{"dur":5,"text":"I think that's a constructive reform, but\nI think both of us would say, this doesn't"},"943":{"dur":1,"text":"solve the basic problem."},"944":{"dur":3,"text":"It doesn't prevent the incentive to book profits."},"948":{"dur":4,"text":"There'll still be an incentive to have profits\noverseas because the overseas rate is
