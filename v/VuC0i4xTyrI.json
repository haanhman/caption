the project that\nwe call Project Butter."},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"The first thing we did was\nimprove the system frame rate"},"386":{"dur":1,"text":"and make it

smoother."},"422":{"dur":4,"text":"Scrolling, paging, animations,\nthey're all buttery smooth."},"427":{"dur":3,"text":"Next, we focused on improving\ntouch experience by

second problem relates to\nhow devices conserve power."},"452":{"dur":3,"text":"They actually dial the CPU back\nto a lower frequency when"},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"there's not much activity in\nthe system, and if you"},"457":{"dur":3,"text":"interact with the system in that\nstate, it can potentially"},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"take 10s of milliseconds\nfor the CPU"},"463":{"dur":1,"text":"to ramp up and respond."},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"And this can lead to\na sluggish UI."},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"So in Jelly Bean, we introduced\nthe concept of"},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"Touch Input Boost."},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"Now when you interact with the\nscreen, we'll instantly ramp"},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"the CPU up."},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"It's literally putting the full\npower of the CPU at your"},"476":{"dur":1,"text":"fingertips."},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, one of our goals when we\nstarted to work in Jelly Bean"},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"was to be able to measure\nand improve interactive"},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"performance in a\nscientific way."},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"So we created a new tool\ncalled systrace."},"488":{"dur":3,"text":"And systrace collects data\ndirectly

a\ngroup of vertically stacked"},"499":{"dur":1,"text":"time series graphs."},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"And in this particular\napplication example, you can"},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"see that there's a

up\na widget from another home"},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"screen and move it\nto this one."},"678":{"dur":1,"text":"Now watch what happens."},"683":{"dur":5,"text":"Everything gets out of the way\nand

to"},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"this screen."},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"It magically re-sizes\non its own."},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you want to do some\nspring cleaning in Jelly

relevant."},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"And the keyboard learns\nintelligently over time."},"746":{"dur":3,"text":"We've also added a bigram\nprediction algorithm which"},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"guesses the

the"},"6106":{"dur":2,"text":"virtual world without\ndistracting you"},"6109":{"dur":2,"text":"from the real world."},"6111":{"dur":3,"text":"And one clear example of this is\nthat we decided to actually"},"6115":{"dur":3,"text":"position the display\nabove your eye."},"6118":{"dur":3,"text":"And Glass as a whole is designed\nto be close to your"},"6121":{"dur":2,"text":"senses, but not

with it."},"6174":{"dur":3,"text":"But that's also a slight\nconflict, through that if this"},"6178":{"dur":5,"text":"is not ridiculously light, it\ndoesn't belong on your

with the user's own"},"6192":{"dur":3,"text":"individuality, so no superfluous\ndetailing."},"6195":{"dur":4,"text":"And we really tried to reduce\nit to its core

when it really dawned on me\nthat we were onto something"},"6224":{"dur":4,"text":"was when I started seeing people\nin our team posting"},"6229":{"dur":3,"text":"pictures on Google+ while\nrunning with it."},"6236":{"dur":5,"text":"And if it's not super\ncomfortable and super sturdy,"},"6242":{"dur":2,"text":"how would you be able to show\noff your serve like this?"},"6245":{"dur":1,"text":"This is Max on our team."},"6247":{"dur":1,"text":"He wanted to brag\na little bit."},"6251":{"dur":4,"text":"But sometimes you want to do\nless conventional sports, like"},"6256":{"dur":1,"text":"jumping into ball pits."},"6262":{"dur":9,"text":"So we want Glass to work for\nmany people and most"},"6272":{"dur":2,"text":"situations."},"6274":{"dur":6,"text":"And realizing that, we needed\nto create a scalable design."},"6280":{"dur":3,"text":"We decided to put all the\ncomponents off to one side,"},"6283":{"dur":4,"text":"creating an asymmetrical design,\nbut

you might be wondering, what\nis the impetus for our"},"6314":{"dur":3,"text":"team to embark on this journey\nto build this system?"},"6317":{"dur":2,"text":"And what are the uses that\nwe envision for this?"},"6319":{"dur":1,"text":"What's the reason for people\nactually to put"},"6321":{"dur":1,"text":"this on their head?"},"6323":{"dur":6,"text":"Broadly speaking, we have two\nbroad regions of aspiration."},"6329":{"dur":4,"text":"The first one has to do with\ncommunicating through images."},"6333":{"dur":4,"text":"And the second one with very\nrapid access to information."},"6338":{"dur":1,"text":"If you think about actually\nhow we connect to people"},"6340":{"dur":1,"text":"today, we might have\na conversation"},"6342":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's an

very"},"6356":{"dur":2,"text":"moment or at any given\npoint in time."},"6358":{"dur":3,"text":"And we believe, actually,\ncommunication with images and"},"6362":{"dur":3,"text":"access to devices that empower\npeople to communicate with"},"6365":{"dur":5,"text":"images in new ways are truly\nrevolutionary and may actually"},"6370":{"dur":3,"text":"enable people to connect\nin new and"},"6374":{"dur":1,"text":"potentially better ways."},"6376":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, wearing a glass has certain\nunique aspects to it."},"6380":{"dur":3,"text":"For example, when you have a\ncompanion camera that's always"},"6384":{"dur":2,"text":"with you, you can catch fleeting\nmoments in your life"},"6387":{"dur":1,"text":"that otherwise would\nbe always

audience"},"6394":{"dur":2,"text":"like myself are parents."},"6396":{"dur":3,"text":"And many, many times, you've\nasked and wished that, oh, I"},"6400":{"dur":2,"text":"wish I had a camera with me\nright now to capture this"},"6403":{"dur":1,"text":"unique moment with my family."},"6404":{"dur":4,"text":"When you have Glass, you can\nactually capture those moments"},"6409":{"dur":3,"text":"and have those memories forever\nrecorded for you."},"6412":{"dur":2,"text":"This is pretty important,\nactually, when we"},"6415":{"dur":2,"text":"enable such a

see the world."},"6426":{"dur":3,"text":"This is one of our team members\nfinishing a race."},"6430":{"dur":4,"text":"And you can see actually how it\nfelt at that very

to you as you were\nenjoying a few seconds of"},"6445":{"dur":4,"text":"break through your busy day."},"6450":{"dur":3,"text":"And going back to the theme of\nfamily, you can actually"},"6453":{"dur":3,"text":"record how your life looked\nlike with your loved ones"},"6457":{"dur":3,"text":"through the first person\npoint of view."},"6461":{"dur":1,"text":"Quite important, I think,\nand it could"},"6462":{"dur":2,"text":"be very, very powerful."},"6465":{"dur":2,"text":"And honestly, there are some\nmoments that you may not want"},"6468":{"dur":1,"text":"to record forever, but\nsometimes it happens."},"6470":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is--"},"6471":{"dur":1,"text":"oh, yeah."},"6472":{"dur":0,"text":"This is Will."},"6473":{"dur":0,"text":"He's sitting right here."},"6474":{"dur":2,"text":"He's one of our team members,\nand he's just practicing pool."},"6476":{"dur":4,"text":"So these things can\nalso happen."},"6480":{"dur":2,"text":"ISABELLE OLSSON: So

months."},"6488":{"dur":4,"text":"So all this footage is from our\nteam using Glass, which is"},"6493":{"dur":2,"text":"pretty incredible."},"6495":{"dur":4,"text":"But what really excites me about\nthis is not only the"},"6500":{"dur":3,"text":"unique perspective from your\npoint of view, but how easy"},"6503":{"dur":2,"text":"and seamless it is to share."},"6506":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think this encouraged\npeople to do"},"6509":{"dur":2,"text":"new things with it."},"6512":{"dur":2,"text":"We just saw how it is to\njump out of a plane."},"6514":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can experience these\nmoments where you feel like"},"6517":{"dur":0,"text":"you're there."},"6518":{"dur":1,"text":"And you don't actually\neven need a Glass"},"6520":{"dur":2,"text":"device to do

dumplings."},"6536":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think there is something\nreally powerful about this."},"6543":{"dur":6,"text":"And sometimes it's all about\nfeeling like you're there."},"6550":{"dur":2,"text":"This stream of pictures\nshowed up."},"6553":{"dur":3,"text":"And I was sitting at my desk,\na little bit bored,"},"6556":{"dur":1,"text":"and this comes

comments and say, dude,"},"6573":{"dur":1,"text":"it's all going to be OK."},"6578":{"dur":5,"text":"And sometimes it's not\nabout grand things."},"6584":{"dur":5,"text":"Sometimes it's only

you get some amazing\nresults back, actually."},"6635":{"dur":3,"text":"We saw some incredible\ntechnology just now"},"6639":{"dur":1,"text":"demonstrated by Android."},"6641":{"dur":2,"text":"And
