Ideally high-volume, non-judgmental. So effectively this robot it's..."},"525":{"dur":4,"text":"the proper name is robotic process\nautomation (RPA). You'll hear of RPA. What"},"530":{"dur":4,"text":"this RPA does is it doesn't go and\ninterface with the source code of the"},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"systems it's interacting with. It goes\nthrough the GUI. It goes through the"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"graphic user interface. Just like a\nhuman."},"541":{"dur":3,"text":"And that way you can pretty much\nautomate anything. Anything that has a"},"544":{"dur":7,"text":"GUI could be automated through an RPA\nprocess. And the benefit here"},"551":{"dur":4,"text":"cross-functional across application\nmacros. It's a little bit like an Excel"},"555":{"dur":4,"text":"macro that's sort of escaped from\nExcel and is on steroids."},"560":{"dur":4,"text":"That's a good way of thinking about it.\nRather than just working within Excel it"},"564":{"dur":6,"text":"will work across ERP systems, Excel\nspreadsheets, banking systems, payment"},"570":{"dur":4,"text":"systems, whatever you can think of. So\nhere are some of the things that it can do."},"575":{"dur":4,"text":"Here is where RPA works well. You can\nimagine that if you've got a sort of"},"580":{"dur":4,"text":"swivel chair environment where you've\ngot an ERP, you've got a banking system,"},"584":{"dur":1,"text":"you got some spreadsheets and so forth."},"585":{"dur":4,"text":"You might go into ERP, find some\ninformation, pull some data, put it into a"},"590":{"dur":5,"text":"spreadsheet,  perform some calculations,\ncreate a new spreadsheet, send it to an"},"595":{"dur":4,"text":"email to someone or group of people. All\nof that is the things that the RPA"},"600":{"dur":7,"text":"technology can do very well. So the\nsurvey, as I said three years ago if"},"607":{"dur":4,"text":"we'd asked this the top bar 'No i'm not\nfamiliar with it' three years ago I would"},"612":{"dur":5,"text":"have thought would maybe be 75-80\npercent. Now only 13 percent aren't"},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"familiar. And if you look at the bottom\nhere,"},"620":{"dur":5,"text":"13 percent have piloted it and an\nextra 9 percent have gone from pilot"},"625":{"dur":5,"text":"into implementation, have actually implemented RPA. So very significant uptake."},"631":{"dur":3,"text":"This is as dramatic an uptake of\ntechnologies I've seen. I've been in this"},"634":{"dur":5,"text":"sector for 25 years or so. It really has\nbeen very very rapid. Furthermore"},"640":{"dur":6,"text":"three-quarters, 76 percent plan\nto investigate RPA opportunities in the"},"646":{"dur":3,"text":"next year or so. So if people aren't at\nthe moment doing it they're at least"},"649":{"dur":5,"text":"looking at it. And the reason why is\nbecause of the benefits, financial and"},"654":{"dur":6,"text":"non-financial, that you get. We asked people how they saw RPA. About half of them"},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"saw it is a very useful automation tool.\nThey thought the big prize will come"},"664":{"dur":3,"text":"with cognitive and AI technologies. I'm\ngoing to come onto the cognitive and AI"},"668":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean cognitive and AI, cognitive\ntechnology, thinking technology,"},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"technology that thinks a little bit"},"674":{"dur":4,"text":"like a human. AI, artificial\nintelligence. Artificial, it's not human."},"678":{"dur":1,"text":"Intelligence,"},"680":{"dur":5,"text":"it's a little bit like human in the way\nit thinks. So there are, RPA is great in a"},"685":{"dur":4,"text":"rules-based structured data environment,\nbut it doesn't think. It follows a rule,"},"690":{"dur":3,"text":"it follows a process. Cognitive is a\nlittle bit different. We''ll come on to"},"693":{"dur":5,"text":"that. 65 percent, about two-thirds of\npeople, felt that it was an operating"},"699":{"dur":4,"text":"model play. that it's going to enable the\nintroduction of a digital workforce."},"704":{"dur":4,"text":"A workforce where you have humans and you have robots working together, where it"},"708":{"dur":5,"text":"makes sense\/. So the robotics do the\nmundane, dull, boring, repetitive stuff and"},"714":{"dur":4,"text":"the humans are freed up to do more value-\nadd, more interesting work. There's a nice"},"718":{"dur":4,"text":"expression that the robot is there to\ntake the robot out of the human. The"},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"robotic tasks, the tasks that humans\nreally don't want to do, they're pretty"},"726":{"dur":4,"text":"dull, the robots are very happy doing.\nThey'll do it not just 9 to 5,  they'll do it 24\/7."},"731":{"dur":4,"text":"They won't take tea breaks, they\nwon't get sick, and they won't go for"},"735":{"dur":5,"text":"Christmas holidays. They're ideal for\nthis type of stuff.  When the"},"741":{"dur":3,"text":"robots create a union then we're in for real  problems but as far as i can"},"744":{"dur":1,"text":"see there are no moves,"},"746":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean unless Clive gets back on and\nyou know.  I don't like Clive, I never liked"},"751":{"dur":7,"text":"So let's look at some of these benefits,\nand the interesting thing is when you"},"759":{"dur":4,"text":"look at this. The people who have piloted\nand implemented RPA are convinced that"},"763":{"dur":3,"text":"there will be significant financial\nbenefits. Some of the people who haven't"},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"have only just heard, don't really know\nyet."},"770":{"dur":3,"text":"So the proof of the pudding is in the\neating here, and those who have done this"},"773":{"dur":4,"text":"those who have played with this, are seeing\nmassive opportunities. And we'll hear"},"777":{"dur":3,"text":"today from quite a few people, some of\nour plenary speakers who've been playing"},"781":{"dur":3,"text":"around with RPA, about what their\ninitial thoughts are on those financial"},"785":{"dur":3,"text":"benefits. I mean if you think about it"},"788":{"dur":4,"text":"a robot, a license for a robot, is going to\ncost something like 5,000 Euro"},"793":{"dur":4,"text":"maybe up to 10,000 Euro, depending on\nthe organisation you go with. The"},"797":{"dur":6,"text":"software and the volume and one robot\ncould have productivity two times, three"},"803":{"dur":4,"text":"times, maybe five times or more of a\nhuman. And remember it can work 24\/7,"},"808":{"dur":4,"text":"if the system is interfacing with are\navailable 24\/7. So if you"},"812":{"dur":3,"text":"think about that, you can imagine that\nthe cost reduction can be very very"},"816":{"dur":5,"text":"significant. Also think about the fact\nthat implementation timelines, it's"},"821":{"dur":4,"text":"nothing like ERP.  I mean ERP systems, you're\ntypically looking at one, two, three, four plus"},"825":{"dur":5,"text":"years to get the whole job done. With an RPA implementation once you've"},"831":{"dur":3,"text":"set up the infrastructure, the controlled\nenvironment, once you've dealt with IT"},"835":{"dur":3,"text":"and so forth, and we'll come back to that, \ncan be a challenge. But once you've done"},"838":{"dur":5,"text":"that robotising a new process can take\ndays or weeks, rather than months or"},"844":{"dur":4,"text":"years. So you really can get paybacks\nwithin less than a year which is pretty"},"848":{"dur":4,"text":"good for any any technology problem,\nchallenge or implementation in my book."},"854":{"dur":6,"text":"If we look at the non financial benefits,\nthe big ones here around timeliness,"},"860":{"dur":6,"text":"accuracy, quality. Clive was right, I hate\nto admit it, they don't make mistakes."},"867":{"dur":5,"text":"If the script, they don't make mistakes\non the script they're on. If the process"},"872":{"dur":4,"text":"changes there will be an error because\nthey can't handle changes in the process."},"877":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's a problem, but if the\nprocess doesn't change they won't make"},"879":{"dur":3,"text":"mistakes. And we've seen that in the\nimplementations we've supported, is the"},"883":{"dur":2,"text":"accuracy increases dramatically."},"889":{"dur":7,"text":"OK, so I think robotics is obviously still a very hot topic. Let's look a"},"896":{"dur":3,"text":"bit about some of the challenges. I\nmentioned initially on a robotics"},"900":{"dur":2,"text":"project you need to set up the\nenvironment. You need to deal with IT."},"903":{"dur":5,"text":"Actually IT can be one of the biggest\nchallenges. IT functions often are not"},"908":{"dur":4,"text":"tremendously supportive of robotics\nprojects. They don't see it as a big"},"913":{"dur":3,"text":"strategic opportunity. It can interfere\nwith what they're trying to do with"},"916":{"dur":4,"text":"ERP and in-memory computing and\nmoving to the cloud and so forth. And"},"921":{"dur":4,"text":"whilst it's a big opportunity, and it can\nfill in a lot of gaps, it might not be"},"925":{"dur":4,"text":"seen as them as strategic. So you need\nto get them on side. They also often"},"929":{"dur":3,"text":"don't play the major part in\nimplementing robotics. This is something"},"932":{"dur":4,"text":"that process owners can do rather than\nIT people. It's not terribly technical"},"937":{"dur":3,"text":"from an IT perspective. We also found\nwhen we're implementing"},"941":{"dur":3,"text":"this internally a couple of years ago\nwithin Deloitte, that our data security"},"944":{"dur":5,"text":"standards and policies were quite, it was quite difficult to make sure that we"},"950":{"dur":3,"text":"tied into all of those, because we have\nvery strict data security standards as"},"953":{"dur":4,"text":"you can imagine dealing with many\nregulated clients. So data security and"},"958":{"dur":1,"text":"IT can be a challenge."},"959":{"dur":6,"text":"Also if the process changes you need a\nfair stability of process. Otherwise if"},"966":{"dur":4,"text":"the process changes and the robot hasn't\nbeen scripted for that change it will it"},"970":{"dur":3,"text":"will either sort of say there's a\nproblem, or there will be an error and you"},"973":{"dur":3,"text":"need to understand where that's\nhappening. So i would say if your process"},"977":{"dur":5,"text":"isn't very stable it might be a bit too\nearly to robotise it. And then obviously"},"982":{"dur":4,"text":"you got to decide, are you looking for\nheadcount reduction or to free people up,"},"986":{"dur":3,"text":"to be more value-add or a bit of both."},"989":{"dur":4,"text":"If it's headcount reduction you'll need\nto have solved the problem of partial"},"994":{"dur":3,"text":"headcount. Typically a robot doesn't\nreplace everything a human does. It"},"998":{"dur":4,"text":"replaces maybe twenty, thirty, forty, fifty\npercent of what that human does, so you"},"1002":{"dur":3,"text":"need to work out how to find those\nheadcount reductions. If everybody is"},"1005":{"dur":4,"text":"going to have twenty, thirty percent more\ntime. But that's a problem that we"},"1009":{"dur":4,"text":"typically know how to handle in the\nshared services world anyway. So as I"},"1014":{"dur":5,"text":"said, robotic is great where you've got\nstructured data and rules based"},"1019":{"dur":6,"text":"processes. Let's talk a bit about AI. \nArtificial intelligence and the headline"},"1025":{"dur":5,"text":"here is this huge potential. But it's\nvery early days. Few successes to date, so"},"1031":{"dur":3,"text":"what we're talking about here is where\nyou've got unstructured data. Where"},"1035":{"dur":3,"text":"you've got reams of natural language."},"1038":{"dur":3,"text":"You've just got emails, documents and so\nforth and it could be thousands or"},"1042":{"dur":4,"text":"millions of pages. Does anyone,\npeople here last year might remember"},"1047":{"dur":7,"text":"that i showed a video of an AI which is\nIBM Watson winning a US quiz show,"},"1054":{"dur":6,"text":"Jeopardy, back in 2011. What IBM did is\nthey set up this AI tool lBM Watson and"},"1061":{"dur":3,"text":"they basically challenged the two best\nplayers at Jeopardy. It's a general"},"1064":{"dur":4,"text":"knowledge quiz, and they took them on and\nthey beat them very easily. And what they"},"1068":{"dur":3,"text":"did is they fed in Wikipedia into"},"1072":{"dur":6,"text":"Watson's brain and they they wrote some\nalgorithms to teach it how the game"},"1078":{"dur":4,"text":"works. And then they fed in thousands of\nquestions so that the machine-learning"},"1083":{"dur":5,"text":"kicked in. So the two key attributes of AI. One is natural language understanding."},"1088":{"dur":3,"text":"It will understand sentences and the\nmeaning of sentences rather than just words."},"1093":{"dur":5,"text":"So you think about, a lot of you will\nhave will have an Apple iPhone or"},"1099":{"dur":4,"text":"something like that so on Apple\niPhones you've got Siri.  Siri is a very"},"1103":{"dur":6,"text":"basic AI. Google search - elements of AI\nthere, although it's more of a word"},"1110":{"dur":4,"text":"search than understanding whole\nsentences. If i was to say to Google"},"1114":{"dur":5,"text":"search: show me all African animals except elephants,"},"1120":{"dur":5,"text":"what do you think I'd get? I'd get a stampede\nof elephants, a stampeding herd of"},"1126":{"dur":5,"text":"elephants coming. So this is beyond Siri\nand beyond Google search."},"1131":{"dur":4,"text":"So what they did with the with the Jeopardy  thing is they fed in thousands of"},"1135":{"dur":2,"text":"questions and the machine learning\nkicked in. This is the second big"},"1138":{"dur":5,"text":"attribute of AI, that the machine will\nget better and better as it learns, and"},"1143":{"dur":3,"text":"it learns from its mistakes, and they won\nthat competition hands down."},"1146":{"dur":5,"text":"So five years later, 2016 where are we\nnow.

And analytics is the big\nopportunity. Analytics is one of the big"},"1676":{"dur":3,"text":"trends that are out there. So if you\nthink about it, in this digital world"},"1680":{"dur":5,"text":"there's so much information we now have\nin organisations. But most organisations"},"1686":{"dur":4,"text":"fail to capture thatinformation\nand turn into real insight for"},"1690":{"dur":5,"text":"decision-making. At best they have\npockets of analytics capabilities in"},"1695":{"dur":2,"text":"various functions around the\norganisation. Of something in HR,"},"1698":{"dur":4,"text":"something in procurement, something in\nmarketing. The opportunity is to create a"},"1702":{"dur":5,"text":"comprehensive organization-wide analytic\nstretching the opportunity is for shared"},"1707":{"dur":6,"text":"services and GBS to play a major role in\nthat analyst expression. So who here has"},"1714":{"dur":6,"text":"an analytic strategy for their shared\nservices GBS organisation? You should be"},"1720":{"dur":6,"text":"thinking about what the role is for shared\nservices and GBS. We do a"},"1726":{"dur":5,"text":"survey every other year. The last survey\nwe did had responses from about,"},"1732":{"dur":4,"text":"about a thousand shared service centres. 65 percent of shared service and GBS"},"1736":{"dur":4,"text":"leaders plan to build their\ncapability and analytics,and to deliver"},"1741":{"dur":5,"text":"insights services by 2018. They plan to\nbuild their analytics capability and"},"1746":{"dur":8,"text":"build and deliver insights services. So\nwhy is shared services well placed to do"},"1755":{"dur":6,"text":"this? Well i think a few reasons. Firstly,\nyour core processes produce a lot of"},"1761":{"dur":3,"text":"this information and data. Think about it, purchase to pay, order the cash, accounts report."},"1765":{"dur":4,"text":"You're producing a lot of the data\naround customers, around suppliers, around"},"1769":{"dur":5,"text":"employees, around costs, around\ninventory. You've got that data."},"1774":{"dur":4,"text":"Secondly, your people are very used to\nhandling data, to dealing with data. They"},"1778":{"dur":4,"text":"understand issues about standardisation, \ndata integrity. They're ideal for this"},"1783":{"dur":4,"text":"type of work. Thirdly shared services and\nGBS touches pretty much all of the"},"1787":{"dur":4,"text":"organisation so you're in a great place\nto bring it all together. And finally"},"1791":{"dur":4,"text":"they need a new job. If the transaction\nprocessing is drying up, is being"},"1796":{"dur":4,"text":"automated, they need to be doing this\nstuff. So the stars are all aligned and"},"1801":{"dur":5,"text":"let's look briefly at what some of these\nanalytics capabilities could be. So"},"1806":{"dur":4,"text":"i'll give you three examples. One would\nbe improving your shared services"},"1811":{"dur":5,"text":"processes. Think about this. You set up a\nhelpdesk. That relieves people doing"},"1816":{"dur":3,"text":"transaction processing stuff, frees them\nup to do what they should be doing. But"},"1820":{"dur":4,"text":"it, also if you have a help desk and you\nhave a ticketing system aligned to the"},"1824":{"dur":3,"text":"helpdesk you're getting information\nabout all the calls coming in. A lot of"},"1828":{"dur":4,"text":"the calls, of problem calls, you're tracking\nall the problems, all the errors you're"},"1832":{"dur":3,"text":"feeding that into your continuous\nimprovement and you're using that to fix"},"1835":{"dur":4,"text":"the root cause of the errors. That's a\ngreat use of analytics, to feed into"},"1840":{"dur":1,"text":"continuous improvement."},"1841":{"dur":5,"text":"Another one is using analytics to really\nunderstand end-to-end processes. One of"},"1846":{"dur":4,"text":"the big challenges for all shared\nservices and GBS organisations is fixing"},"1851":{"dur":4,"text":"end-to-end processes. Fixing\npurchase-to-pay from purchase"},"1856":{"dur":4,"text":"procurement sourcing to payment. Analytics can help provide information"},"1860":{"dur":4,"text":"so that people understand what's going\non in the process and can optimise the"},"1864":{"dur":6,"text":"process. And finally helping the\norganisation as a whole by linking one"},"1870":{"dur":3,"text":"action from one function to another. So\ni'll give you an example. We work with a"},"1874":{"dur":4,"text":"retail organisation and they were\ninterested in understanding, they had 600"},"1878":{"dur":4,"text":"stores in the UK, interested in\nunderstanding the drivers of store"},"1882":{"dur":4,"text":"profitability. So we looked at lots of\ninformation and correlated it with store"},"1886":{"dur":4,"text":"profitability and we saw a really\ninteresting correlation that no one had"},"1890":{"dur":4,"text":"realised before. Where the store manager\nrole was vacant for more than three"},"1895":{"dur":4,"text":"months store sales dropped dramatically,\nand sore profitability dropped"},"1900":{"dur":2,"text":"dramatically. As a result of that, they\nchanged their recruitment strategy to"},"1903":{"dur":3,"text":"make sure that they never had a vacancy\nin the store manager role for more than"},"1906":{"dur":4,"text":"three months. That's a simple example. The shared service centre was the one that"},"1910":{"dur":6,"text":"initiated this. Now some of you may say,\nbut look, the business thinks I can just"},"1917":{"dur":3,"text":"about do transaction processing. They\ndon't think i can do analytics stuff. How"},"1920":{"dur":4,"text":"am I going to get into this? You need\ncredibility, you need business permission,"},"1925":{"dur":5,"text":"you need brand permission. The way to do\nit is maybe to find some business issues"},"1930":{"dur":3,"text":"and problems that you think you can help\nwith, and just start doing it and showing"},"1934":{"dur":2,"text":"people, and saying here we can help you\nwith this."},"1936":{"dur":6,"text":"That might get you the credibility that\nyou need. So my final observation is"},"1942":{"dur":6,"text":"actually around that point about how you\nget the credibility. There will be a PR"},"1948":{"dur":4,"text":"battle. You need to win it. In my job I\nspeak to a lot of shared service leaders"},"1953":{"dur":4,"text":"and often the conversation starts\nsomething like this. I say so,"},"1959":{"dur":6,"text":"so how's it going? And they say, \nthey're standing over here,  I'm standing"},"1965":{"dur":4,"text":"here. They say, yes it's going well you\nknow. Our systems implementation is going well."},"1970":{"dur":4,"text":"Standardisation project's going pretty\ngood. The costs have down about fifteen"},"1974":{"dur":7,"text":"percent. We're offshoring a bit more and\nand our SLAs are all looking green. And I"},"1982":{"dur":6,"text":"think why are you looking so unhappy? And\nthey don't say anything, they just look"},"1988":{"dur":4,"text":"unhappy. Nice, and then I ask the killer\nquestion. I sort of say,  so are"},"1993":{"dur":3,"text":"your customers happy, and what's\nthe reputation of your shared service"},"1997":{"dur":3,"text":"organisation? And they look even gloomier.\nLet's say, well I don't think our"},"2000":{"dur":3,"text":"customers really are happy when I speak\nto them, and the reputation is"},"2004":{"dur":3,"text":"terrible. And that happens in a lot of\norganisations. It looks like, objectively,"},"2007":{"dur":5,"text":"the measures all look pretty good. Costs\nhave come down. SLAs are good and yet the"},"2012":{"dur":3,"text":"customers aren't happy and the reputation\nis very poor. So he got me thinking about"},"2016":{"dur":4,"text":"this, and in some cases it's because it's\nnot a very good shared service centre."},"2021":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's be honest. Sometimes it's not\nworking very well and they need to fix a"},"2025":{"dur":3,"text":"lot of things, but in other cases there's\nnothing wrong with a shared service"},"2028":{"dur":6,"text":"centre. Everything has been improved and\nyet the reputation is still very poor."},"2034":{"dur":2,"text":"So what are the causes? Well there are a\ncouple of things I can think of here."},"2036":{"dur":3,"text":"Firstly, when shared services is created"},"2040":{"dur":3,"text":"there's typically a lot of resistance in\nthe business units. They see it as a threat."},"2044":{"dur":3,"text":"You're taking away activities. You're\ntaking away, in some cases, some power,"},"2048":{"dur":5,"text":"some control. You're leading redundancies locally. That doesn't go down well."},"2053":{"dur":0,"text":"It rarely does."},"2054":{"dur":4,"text":"So a lot of them want shared services or\nGBS to fail. That doesn't help."},"2058":{"dur":5,"text":"Secondly shared services and GBS often\nperform the last step in a long"},"2064":{"dur":5,"text":"process. And the errors are seen in the\nlast steps of purchase to pay accounts"},"2069":{"dur":3,"text":"report. You can't pay a supplier. You\ncan't collect the cash."},"2072":{"dur":3,"text":"Everyone thinks it's the shared service\ncentre or the GBS that screwed up."},"2075":{"dur":3,"text":"The problem is often way back here. It's\nnothing to do with shared services."},"2079":{"dur":4,"text":"I remember [Anoura Walia] shared services\nleader in the UK years ago. She said, 'When"},"2083":{"dur":6,"text":"I die I want my gravestone to say 'Thank\nyou for the 99'. And I said, 'That's"},"2089":{"dur":2,"text":"interesting. What are you talking\nabout?'"},"2091":{"dur":4,"text":"And she said, 'Well. everyone gives me a\nhard time for the one percent that goes wrong."},"2097":{"dur":5,"text":"No one thanks me for the 99\npercent that actually goes well.'  So, and"},"2102":{"dur":1,"text":"actually it's a fair point,"},"2104":{"dur":4,"text":"So that's another reason. So is\nthis a problem? Do you need to be loved?"},"2110":{"dur":5,"text":"Let's get some feedback on that. No. Well i would say maybe you don't"},"2116":{"dur":3,"text":"need to be loved, but you do need to be\nappreciated and respected. And here are a"},"2120":{"dur":4,"text":"few reasons why. If you're not, there\nis a risk that the businesses may do"},"2124":{"dur":4,"text":"their own thing, may create their\nduplicate processes, may pull stuff back"},"2129":{"dur":3,"text":"Secondly, you're gonna be wrapped up in\ndisputes the whole time with your"},"2133":{"dur":4,"text":"customers. That's a waste of time\nand it's not good for morale in"},"2137":{"dur":4,"text":"the shared service centre. It's pretty\ntough for people to be disputing issues"},"2141":{"dur":3,"text":"the whole time with their customers. In\nfact, the third issue is that morale is"},"2144":{"dur":2,"text":"going to drop in your shared service\ncentre. It's going to be more difficult to"},"2146":{"dur":4,"text":"recruit people and to retain them. Aand\nfinally you're not going to get brand"},"2151":{"dur":3,"text":"permission to do more interesting things\nIf they don't think you're doing a good"},"2155":{"dur":3,"text":"job right now with transaction\nprocessing. So you're not going to move"},"2158":{"dur":3,"text":"up the value chain. So I'd say for all\nthose reasons it is important. And here"},"2162":{"dur":3,"text":"are two or three things you can do to\nmaybe fix it."},"2166":{"dur":6,"text":"You need to think about, you need to\nthink about your brand. You need to think"},"2172":{"dur":3,"text":"about the image. You need to have a PR\nstrategy."},"2175":{"dur":9,"text":"Who here has done any work on the shared\nservices or GBS brand? Few of you. Who has"},"2184":{"dur":4,"text":"a PR strategy for shared services or GBS\norganisation. OK, again a few of you. So it"},"2189":{"dur":3,"text":"is something you're thinking about. Ithink you need to be thinking about getting"},"2192":{"dur":4,"text":"and keeping senior management commitment. You absolutely have got to have senior"},"2196":{"dur":1,"text":"management on board."},"2197":{"dur":2,"text":"They've got to understand what you're\ndoing and support it.  Otherwise there'll be"},"2200":{"dur":4,"text":"cracks all the way down. You need to\ninvolve stakeholders in any change. You"},"2204":{"dur":4,"text":"need to involve key customers, key\nbusinesses you're dealing with in any"},"2208":{"dur":4,"text":"major change. 'That which I create I do\nnot reject.' 'That which I create I do"},"2213":{"dur":2,"text":"not reject.' If you want people to buy\ninto change you've got to involve"},"2216":{"dur":4,"text":"them in it, otherwise they're likely to\nreject it. You need to think about your"},"2221":{"dur":3,"text":"end-to-end processes. When you've got\nsituations where the problems look like"},"2224":{"dur":3,"text":"they're happening here, but are caused\nhere, you need to have an explanation"},"2228":{"dur":3,"text":"of that to people. You need to have the data to show what's going on,"},"2231":{"dur":4,"text":"show the end-to-end process. And you need to have better and metrics to make sure"},"2235":{"dur":4,"text":"arguments are based in fact and not in\npeople's opinion. People put their"},"2240":{"dur":4,"text":"rose-tinted spectacles on and think that\nlife was perfect before shared services."},"2244":{"dur":3,"text":"It wasn't. And if you've got the data you\ncan show it wasn't. Finally, you need to"},"2248":{"dur":5,"text":"think about implementing and acting on\ncustomer surveys and feedback. I think if"},"2253":{"dur":4,"text":"you do all those things you might just\nimprove your your brand image, and you"},"2257":{"dur":3,"text":"might just then have the opportunity to\nmove up the value chain.
