helpful starting school."},"177":{"dur":1,"text":"But yes, if you\nsend your stuff in."},"179":{"dur":3,"text":"So like Samantha sent in the\nbest corner in the house,

here"},"238":{"dur":1,"text":"last week, all of\nthose interactive tools"},"239":{"dur":2,"text":"should be coming up on screen so\nthat we can get a sense of who"},"242":{"dur":1,"text":"you are out there."},"243":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, we've got a lot\nto get through today,"},"245":{"dur":2,"text":"so I'm going to welcome our\nfirst guest, Jonquil Lowe."},"247":{"dur":0,"text":"Welcome, Jonquil, to the studio."},"248":{"dur":0,"text":"JONQUIL LOWE: Hello, Karen."},"249":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Now,\nyou have the task"},"250":{"dur":3,"text":"of telling us about\nfinding, planning,"},"253":{"dur":3,"text":"and formatting your TMA."},"256":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is the first\nof four sessions"},"258":{"dur":2,"text":"that we're going to be\ndoing around all of this."},"260":{"dur":1,"text":"Then later we have\nJayne Horne, who's"},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"going to talk to us about\nhow to submit the TMA."},"264":{"dur":2,"text":"Peter Taylor is going to\ntalk to us about expectations"},"266":{"dur":0,"text":"and feedback."},"267":{"dur":1,"text":"And then Katherine\nMoore from the library"},"268":{"dur":2,"text":"is going to give us a\nlittle run through how"},"270":{"dur":2,"text":"the library can give people\nhelp in their studies."},"273":{"dur":3,"text":"So Jonquil, oops, we've\ngot our website here"},"276":{"dur":1,"text":"that we need to look at."},"278":{"dur":2,"text":"And for a lot of students,\nfinding their TMA"},"281":{"dur":2,"text":"is going to be pretty\nimportant as they start."},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"So we've got a lot of\nnew students out there."},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"Where do they look, and\nhow do they actually"},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"find out where these\nare, and how important"},"290":{"dur":1,"text":"is it to look for them early?"},"291":{"dur":5,"text":"JONQUIL LOWE: OK, so\nI've got the DD102 2015J"},"296":{"dur":1,"text":"website up here."},"298":{"dur":1,"text":"I chose 2015 because\nI didn't want"},"300":{"dur":3,"text":"to give away any answers to\nthe TMAs that are coming up,"},"303":{"dur":2,"text":"so we're looking at the\nslightly older site."},"306":{"dur":5,"text":"And on this website, as\non all OU module sites,"},"311":{"dur":3,"text":"if you scroll down, on the\nright hand side under Resources"},"315":{"dur":1,"text":"you'll find\nAssessment Resources."},"317":{"dur":3,"text":"So you'll always\nfind your TMAs there."},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"They're also listed\nin the study planner,"},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"but Assessment Resources\nis a good place"},"325":{"dur":3,"text":"to go to get an overview."},"329":{"dur":1,"text":"So here we are."},"330":{"dur":3,"text":"With this particular\nmodule, there are five TMAs."},"334":{"dur":4,"text":"There are also some ICMAs, so\nlittle Interactive Computer"},"338":{"dur":1,"text":"Marked Assessments."},"339":{"dur":4,"text":"And you can click through\nto any of them from here."},"344":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, you said how important\nis it to find them early."},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"It depends a bit what\nkind of student you are."},"349":{"dur":1,"text":"If you've got lots\nof time, then you"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"might want to go through\nthe module materials,"},"354":{"dur":4,"text":"and then look at the TMA\nand draw on the notes"},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"you've been making as you've\ngone through the module."},"360":{"dur":3,"text":"That's kind of what I'd call\na kind of holistic approach."},"363":{"dur":3,"text":"But a lot of our students,\nvery short of time."},"367":{"dur":3,"text":"And in that case, you might\nwant to look at your assignments"},"370":{"dur":3,"text":"early so that as you read\nyour module materials,"},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"you're very aware\nof what you're going"},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"to pull out to use in your TMA."},"378":{"dur":1,"text":"That means you\ndon't have to take"},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"quite such a\ncomprehensive approach"},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"to studying the module material."},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's one way of\nmanaging your time."},"387":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: OK,\nthat's a great idea."},"388":{"dur":2,"text":"Because 65% of our audience out\nthere are level one students,"},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"so we've got 18% at\nlevel two, so they'll"},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"be very familiar\nwith the TMA process."},"396":{"dur":1,"text":"Can we have a look at a TMA?"},"397":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, I'm one of these\npeople who - I like"},"399":{"dur":3,"text":"to know what the danger\nis before it's there."},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think sometimes it can be\nquite reassuring to sort of see"},"405":{"dur":1,"text":"what you're being asked to do."},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"Because sometimes it's not as\ncomplicated as you might think."},"409":{"dur":1,"text":"JONQUIL LOWE: No,\nno, no, it's not."},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Other times it is."},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"JONQUIL LOWE: All\nlevel one modules"},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"are trying to get you\ninto the OU way of study,"},"418":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's always a\nreally gentle start."},"420":{"dur":3,"text":"So the first TMA is\nnot threatening at all."},"424":{"dur":4,"text":"It's usually a lot shorter than\nthe TMAs that come up later."},"428":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's just to start opening\na dialogue with your tutor."},"432":{"dur":3,"text":"Because what you need to\nremember with OU TMAs is it's"},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"not all about the mark."},"437":{"dur":3,"text":"You're demonstrating your\nunderstanding of the module"},"441":{"dur":3,"text":"so that your tutor can see\nwhere your strengths are,"},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"where your weaknesses are,\nhow best you can develop,"},"448":{"dur":3,"text":"and give you the advice you\nneed in order to develop."},"451":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's really important that\nyou get that first TMA in"},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"so that your tutor can start\nto help you effectively."},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"Of course, you know, we're\nall interested in our marks,"},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"aren't we."},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"But they're really not\nthe most important bit,"},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"especially at a level one."},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"Where level one, pass,\nfail distinction,"},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"sometimes it's really not going\nto make a lot of difference"},"472":{"dur":4,"text":"in the long run whether you\nget a 45% or 70% pass mark."},"477":{"dur":3,"text":"But what is important is that\nfeedback from your tutor."},"480":{"dur":4,"text":"So as well as getting the PT3\nthat summarises your tutor's"},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"feedback, you'll also\n- it's really important"},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"to click through to your script,\nwhere you tutor will have"},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"put lots of detailed comments."},"492":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Well, you'd\nbe very pleased to know"},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"that 84% of our\naudience out there"},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"already know what\ntheir first TMA is."},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"JONQUIL LOWE: Fantastic."},"498":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: It's great."},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"And we've got a lot, about\njust over half of the people"},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"watching are FASS, so Faculty\nof Arts and Social Sciences,"},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"So DD102 may well\nbe one of the models"},"508":{"dur":1,"text":"that people are working on."},"509":{"dur":1,"text":"Of course, the one that\nwe're showing here now"},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"is an example from last year\nso that we don't give anything"},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"But Jonquil, you've accessed\nthis from the study planner"},"517":{"dur":1,"text":"where all the links are."},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you want to, you can\nrevisit Georgina's session"},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"on how to navigate the VLE."},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"But also these are listed\nunder the assessment section"},"526":{"dur":1,"text":"of the website, aren't they?"},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can find them\nall in one go as well."},"529":{"dur":3,"text":"JONQUIL LOWE: So that's how\nI came into it, in fact."},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"Through - so you're right."},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's just go back here."},"536":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is the study planner,\nand you can see, for example,"},"540":{"dur":5,"text":"TMA 01 is listed there,\nand you can click on it."},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"But also, in this right\nhand navigation panel,"},"549":{"dur":3,"text":"if you scroll down, you can\nsee the heading resources."},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"So you've got study resources,\nwhich is all your module"},"555":{"dur":3,"text":"materials, and then underneath\nthat, assessment resources."},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's where you'll\nfind all your TMAs listed."},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can click\nthrough to each one."},"565":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: So two\nroutes to get in there."},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Excellent, OK."},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"So a lot of people are really\nexcited about their TMAs, which"},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"So they found them,\nthey're excited about it."},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"And you mentioned that\nthis is a way of learning,"},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"and you get your detailed\nfeedback and things"},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"from your tutor."},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"So can you sort of talk\na little bit about,"},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"I guess from your\nperspective as a tutor,"},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"what is the point\nof this assessment?"},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"And how should\nstudents be viewing it?"},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"JONQUIL LOWE: OK, so this\nis very much at the heart"},"590":{"dur":1,"text":"of distance learning."},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you are at the\nconventional university,"},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"you would be meeting your tutor."},"597":{"dur":1,"text":"You'd still have\nassignments, but you'd"},"599":{"dur":4,"text":"have a lot of opportunity\nto perhaps talk one to one"},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"and get feedback\non how you're doing"},"606":{"dur":3,"text":"and what you need to do better."},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"With the OU, because\nwe're distance learning,"},"612":{"dur":3,"text":"a lot of that takes place\nthrough the TMA process."},"615":{"dur":4,"text":"So you're sending in your TMA\nso that your tutor can then"},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"give you the advice\nand help and support"},"622":{"dur":3,"text":"that you need to get better."},"625":{"dur":4,"text":"So it depends a little\nbit what sort of exercises"},"630":{"dur":4,"text":"you've got in your TMAs."},"634":{"dur":4,"text":"So with social sciences, very\noften they're essay questions."},"639":{"dur":4,"text":"So the bulk of your marks\nwill be for writing an essay,"},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"and that's certainly the\ncase, generally, with DD 102."},"647":{"dur":3,"text":"With some of the other\nmodules, they may be split."},"650":{"dur":4,"text":"So you might have essay\nquestions for part of your TMA,"},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"but you also might have\nsome shorter questions."},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"And they typically\ntake the format"},"659":{"dur":3,"text":"of asking you for,\nmaybe, definitions,"},"663":{"dur":1,"text":"or to do a calculation."},"665":{"dur":3,"text":"And then you need to analyse\nthe results that you've got from"},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"those early parts\nof the question."},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"And you'll typically find\nthat most of the marks"},"673":{"dur":1,"text":"go with the analysis."},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"So the early bit is checking\nyou understand the concepts,"},"677":{"dur":2,"text":"understand the data,\nand then you use it."},"680":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's where your marks are."},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"So those are the common\nkinds of assessment"},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"that you'll find\nin social sciences."},"686":{"dur":4,"text":"In some other disciplines, you\nmight have to write a report."},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"And that, again, is a\nslightly different format."},"693":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, the good thing is\nthat within the modules,"},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"you'll be taught\nthe study skills."},"701":{"dur":6,"text":"So if we just go back again\nto the main module page,"},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"I said above\nassessment resources"},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"you've got study resources."},"713":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, this is DD102,\nand DD103 is similar."},"718":{"dur":1,"text":"But you'll find if\nyou scroll down,"},"720":{"dur":4,"text":"it's got skills,\nactivities, and here"},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"we've got, for example,\nwriting assignments."},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"So can you see that?"},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"And each of these\nlinks will go through"},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"to the part of the\nmodule where there's"},"735":{"dur":3,"text":"some actual teaching of\nthese particular study skills"},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"and activities that you can do."},"742":{"dur":3,"text":"So for example, you've got\nwriting effective introductions"},"745":{"dur":1,"text":"for an essay."},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"So you'll find some\nactivities there"},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"that they give you,\nfor example, you know,"},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"bad introductions,\ngood introductions,"},"753":{"dur":1,"text":"and helping you to\ndistinguish between them"},"755":{"dur":4,"text":"so that you can build your skill\nof writing your essays well."},"760":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Now,\nskills are one thing."},"762":{"dur":1,"text":"And, you know, it's nice\nto be able to go back"},"764":{"dur":1,"text":"to those and level\none, you know,"},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"it's the skills and the content\nthat are sort of tandemed along"},"769":{"dur":0,"text":"to develop skills."},"770":{"dur":2,"text":"But Judy and Silvia\nare saying that they're"},"772":{"dur":2,"text":"worried about actually\nunderstanding the TMA question."},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"They don't mind doing\nit, but they really"},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"want to know exactly\nwhat the question is."},"779":{"dur":1,"text":"I think, I don't know."},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"As a tutor, I'd say that\nthat's quite a common error"},"784":{"dur":2,"text":"that people might make, is\ndoing really well but maybe"},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"not quite addressing\nthat question."},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"JONQUIL LOWE: That's\na very common error."},"791":{"dur":3,"text":"And quite often\nthe student notes,"},"794":{"dur":2,"text":"which are an important\npart of your assignment,"},"796":{"dur":1,"text":"so you've got the\nquestion, you've"},"798":{"dur":1,"text":"got some notes that\nare there to help you."},"800":{"dur":2,"text":"So goodness sake,\ndo read those notes."},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"Because they will point you\nto the bits of the module"},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"you should be using and what\nthe question is looking for,"},"808":{"dur":2,"text":"they'll give you lots\nof tips and advice."},"811":{"dur":1,"text":"But yeah, a really\ncommon problem"},"812":{"dur":4,"text":"is students write the\nessay they wanted to write"},"816":{"dur":3,"text":"rather than the one\nthat's actually been set."},"820":{"dur":3,"text":"So for example, one of the\nmodules I'm involved with,"},"823":{"dur":2,"text":"we always have a\nquestion on debt."},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"And you know, it's meant to be\nquite a theoretical question."},"828":{"dur":2,"text":"But people have very\nstrong feelings about debt."},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"And not surprisingly,\nyou know, they"},"831":{"dur":2,"text":"want to get those\nfeelings across."},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"But that is not the\npoint of the TMA,"},"837":{"dur":3,"text":"so it's really important to read\nthe question very thoroughly"},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"and understand what it's saying."},"843":{"dur":5,"text":"So for example, this\nTMA, this is DD102"},"848":{"dur":3,"text":"and the first TMA is\nquite straightforward."},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's not particularly\nlong, you only"},"854":{"dur":1,"text":"have to write 250 words."},"856":{"dur":3,"text":"It says, in your own words,\ndefine difference and provide"},"859":{"dur":3,"text":"two examples

you could just"},"893":{"dur":1,"text":"look at that they go, oh, yeah."},"894":{"dur":0,"text":"I can go and do that."},"895":{"dur":2,"text":"A City Road, right, I'll\nfind out where that

to add."},"931":{"dur":1,"text":"But I guess what you're\nsaying, really, is"},"933":{"dur":2,"text":"that this is assessing\nyour idea of what"},"935":{"dur":1,"text":"that module has given you."},"936":{"dur":2,"text":"So you read the books, we need\nto check that you've read them"},"938":{"dur":2,"text":"and understand them and\nunderstand the context"},"940":{"dur":0,"text":"in which some of this applies."},"941":{"dur":2,"text":"JONQUIL LOWE: Well, it's not\nquite as mechanical as that,"},"943":{"dur":1,"text":"because what you're\ndeveloping at university"},"945":{"dur":1,"text":"is what we call\ncritical thinking."},"947":{"dur":3,"text":"So it is the ability to\ntake ideas and apply them"},"951":{"dur":1,"text":"and to question what\nyou come across."},"953":{"dur":2,"text":"And certainly, you\nwill have experiences"},"955":{"dur":1,"text":"that may be very relevant."},"957":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's fine to bring\nthem in, but it's"},"959":{"dur":2,"text":"bringing them in\nin a structured way"},"962":{"dur":3,"text":"and making sure that the\nframework of your answers"},"965":{"dur":2,"text":"is building on what you've\nlearned in the module."},"967":{"dur":2,"text":"So fine to bring in\nsome personal examples,"},"970":{"dur":2,"text":"as long as they're\nrelevant and as long"},"973":{"dur":3,"text":"as they're argued in a\nkind of academic way."},"976":{"dur":3,"text":"You can't just say,\nwell, I think this."},"979":{"dur":4,"text":"We're looking for evidence,\nalways, in academic

ideas are\nthere that support"},"994":{"dur":1,"text":"this argument that\nyou're making."},"996":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's really important."},"997":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: OK, great."},"998":{"dur":2,"text":"JONQUIL LOWE: And then as\nwell as these content words"},"1001":{"dur":4,"text":"- so here it's the\ndifference, it's the examples"},"1005":{"dur":1,"text":"that you're going to bring in."},"1006":{"dur":2,"text":"We have what are\ncalled process words,"},"1008":{"dur":4,"text":"and the process word\nhere is the word define."},"1013":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's saying

just"},"1027":{"dur":3,"text":"go to a glossary or a margin\ndefinition in their textbook,"},"1031":{"dur":1,"text":"and they just quote it."},"1032":{"dur":3,"text":"That's not very helpful for\nthis

words,"},"1050":{"dur":3,"text":"describe what it is\nthat you have learned."},"1054":{"dur":2,"text":"So that way your tutor\ncan see oh, yes, you know,"},"1056":{"dur":1,"text":"they've got that concept."},"1057":{"dur":1,"text":"Or hmm, that's not quite right."},"1059":{"dur":2,"text":"So you know, here's\nsome advice on how"},"1061":{"dur":1,"text":"to get it right next

up to you."},"1107":{"dur":3,"text":"But your tutor can give you\na lot of help and support."},"1111":{"dur":2,"text":"So my students, quite often,\nthey're very time

say"},"1139":{"dur":3,"text":"- is not going to necessarily\nsay yes, this is a great plan,"},"1143":{"dur":1,"text":"no, this is a lousy plan."},"1145":{"dur":3,"text":"But they can give you

250 words,\nso not a huge amount."},"1417":{"dur":2,"text":"But it wants to look\nat how you tackle"},"1420":{"dur":3,"text":"this question, how fluently\nyou can write about

which chapters,"},"1433":{"dur":1,"text":"which parts of the chapters."},"1434":{"dur":4,"text":"So that's really useful, that\ntells you where to explore."},"1439":{"dur":3,"text":"It highlights that

saying oh yes, well,\nthis expert argued this."},"1536":{"dur":3,"text":"And you must acknowledge\nthat expert there."},"1540":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, there's a way of doing it."},"1542":{"dur":2,"text":"We tend to use a\nconvention called Harvard."},"1544":{"dur":2,"text":"There are different ones, but\nwe use Harvard referencing."},"1547":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's a

feedback."},"3392":{"dur":1,"text":"So we've got some\nwidgets there, and we"},"3394":{"dur":2,"text":"want to know how good\nis the Student Hub Live?"},"3397":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, a lot of you are

really"},"3429":{"dur":0,"text":"good tips in."},"3430":{"dur":2,"text":"How did it help you improve?"},"3432":{"dur":1,"text":"So what was the best\nthing someone said to

marking process."},"3448":{"dur":0,"text":"How does it all work?"},"3449":{"dur":2,"text":"PETER TAYLOR: So\nyou've been listening"},"3452":{"dur":5,"text":"to how you submit your TMAs, and\nthey go

them."},"3461":{"dur":4,"text":"And an important aspect of\nthat is the grading process."},"3466":{"dur":2,"text":"But in many ways, it's not\nthe most important process."},"3468":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Well,\nour students think"},"3470":{"dur":2,"text":"it is, because the other week\nwe asked them what they thought,"},"3472":{"dur":1,"text":"and they were all like\ngrades, grades, grades."},"3474":{"dur":3,"text":"PETER TAYLOR: Yeah,\nbut actually, as an AL,"},"3478":{"dur":2,"text":"I spend much more time\ngiving the feedback"},"3480":{"dur":1,"text":"than they do worrying\nabout the grade."},"3482":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: That's a\ngood point, actually."},"3484":{"dur":1,"text":"PETER TAYLOR: So I put\na lot more of my time"},"3485":{"dur":4,"text":"into writing that feedback,\nand it's specifically tailored"},"3490":{"dur":1,"text":"to an individual's need."},"3491":{"dur":2,"text":"And I really hope that\nthe person who gets it"},"3494":{"dur":2,"text":"is going to be able to read\nit, to be able to find time"},"3497":{"dur":2,"text":"to reflect upon it,\nand think about how"},"3500":{"dur":5,"text":"they can use what my comments\nare to improve their next TMA."},"3506":{"dur":2,"text":"So yes, the grades\nare important."},"3508":{"dur":4,"text":"But that kind of feedback,\nthat kind of extra information"},"3512":{"dur":2,"text":"that you're getting\nas an individual,"},"3515":{"dur":4,"text":"and that feed forward into the\nnext TMA, is really crucial."},"3520":{"dur":3,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: As an AL,\nhow often do students"},"3523":{"dur":1,"text":"make the same sorts of errors?"},"3524":{"dur":1,"text":"Do you find yourself\noften

that's\na problem for me sometimes."},"3534":{"dur":3,"text":"So sometimes, I remember\na couple of years ago,"},"3537":{"dur":2,"text":"this was on a project module."},"3539":{"dur":4,"text":"And as part of my feedback,\nI gave some suggestions"},"3544":{"dur":2,"text":"for possible ways in\nwhich they could change"},"3546":{"dur":3,"text":"their title of the project."},"3549":{"dur":3,"text":"And about two or\nthree weeks later,"},"3552":{"dur":1,"text":"I got an email from\nthem saying can you"},"3554":{"dur":3,"text":"give me some suggestions about\nwhat I should put for my title."},"3557":{"dur":1,"text":"So clearly they had\nnot actually read"},"3559":{"dur":2,"text":"the feedback I'd given\nthem, which actually"},"3562":{"dur":1,"text":"provided that information."},"3564":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's because they get\nthe grade, they look at it,"},"3567":{"dur":1,"text":"they think, hmm, I got 68%."},"3569":{"dur":0,"text":"That's not too bad."},"3570":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll look at the feedback."},"3572":{"dur":3,"text":"But then other things\nget in the way,"},"3575":{"dur":2,"text":"the kind of study of the course\nseems much more important."},"3577":{"dur":5,"text":"And never quite get around\nto looking at that feedback."},"3583":{"dur":6,"text":"It's about making space\nin your study timetable"},"3589":{"dur":3,"text":"to actually allocate to\nlooking at the feedback."},"3593":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Yeah, yeah."},"3594":{"dur":1,"text":"But it can be hard, I think."},"3596":{"dur":3,"text":"Because so often,\nultimately, the feedback"},"3599":{"dur":2,"text":"is really telling\nyou how to improve."},"3602":{"dur":2,"text":"And one could be forgiven\nfor thinking that's mainly"},"3604":{"dur":3,"text":"negative, even though I know\nwhen I'm marking, I really try"},"3607":{"dur":2,"text":"and make sure that I've got\na lot of positive things"},"3609":{"dur":1,"text":"in there, because positive\nfeedback is just as"},"3611":{"dur":1,"text":"important as negative feedback."},"3613":{"dur":1,"text":"But equally I appreciate that\nwhen you're getting it back"},"3614":{"dur":1,"text":"and you look at\nyour grade, you have"},"3616":{"dur":1,"text":"some sort of value\nladen way of looking"},"3618":{"dur":3,"text":"at that going 68, that's good,\nthat's bad, that's whatever."},"3621":{"dur":2,"text":"Rah, I'm putting it down,\nif you're not happy with it."},"3623":{"dur":1,"text":"Or that yes, that's great."},"3624":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, I don't need to read it."},"3626":{"dur":1,"text":"So what happens,\nthen, in that process?"},"3628":{"dur":1,"text":"How would you advise\npeople actually"},"3629":{"dur":1,"text":"get on board with\naccepting the grade"},"3631":{"dur":1,"text":"and then looking\nat the feedback?"},"3632":{"dur":3,"text":"PETER TAYLOR: I always feel\nthat irrespective of the grade,"},"3635":{"dur":2,"text":"there is good\nfeedback within it."},"3638":{"dur":4,"text":"So even if I'm giving someone\nwith 85% who hasn't actually"},"3642":{"dur":3,"text":"got very much kind of\nwrong, I'm still identifying"},"3645":{"dur":2,"text":"ways in which they could\nimprove, thinking about the

way\nthey're using tables, figures,"},"3656":{"dur":3,"text":"But there's always ways in\nwhich people can improve."},"3660":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think - I agree."},"3663":{"dur":3,"text":"When I was a lad,\nback in the dark ages,"},"3666":{"dur":1,"text":"the kind of feedback\nI used to get"},"3668":{"dur":3,"text":"was just things like,\nthis is rubbish."},"3671":{"dur":1,"text":"That was useless."},"3672":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, apart from making\nme feel bad about myself,"},"3675":{"dur":3,"text":"it really didn't help\nme kind of progress"},"3678":{"dur":1,"text":"and learn from my mistakes."},"3680":{"dur":2,"text":"Hopefully within\nthe Open University,"},"3683":{"dur":3,"text":"we've moved on so\nthat now we're kind"},"3687":{"dur":3,"text":"of identifying ways in\nwhich

OK."},"3714":{"dur":2,"text":"How helpful is the\nStudent Hub Live?"},"3716":{"dur":0,"text":"They said 100%."},"3717":{"dur":1,"text":"I think they are a\nbit biassed, though,"},"3719":{"dur":3,"text":"because maybe those who\naren't have been kicked out."},"3722":{"dur":0,"text":"So how good is it?"},"3723":{"dur":0,"text":"100%."},"3724":{"dur":0,"text":"100%."},"3725":{"dur":1,"text":"So we've got some\nnumerical data,"},"3726":{"dur":1,"text":"that's obviously brilliant."},"3727":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you for that."},"3729":{"dur":2,"text":"What is the best thing\nabout the Student Hub Live?"},"3731":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is a little bit\nmore of a

academic."},"3773":{"dur":1,"text":"So a real mixture\nof things there."},"3775":{"dur":2,"text":"But when you think about\nsome of these things,"},"3777":{"dur":2,"text":"how do you feel

one of the\nthings I should say,"},"3792":{"dur":3,"text":"it's not just TMAs\nthat give feedback,"},"3796":{"dur":2,"text":"but our computer marked\nassignments give feedback"},"3798":{"dur":0,"text":"as well."},"3799":{"dur":1,"text":"PETER TAYLOR: The ICMAs."},"3801":{"dur":5,"text":"So all of our kind of assessment\nhas some feedback

your 100% of liking the\nStudent Hub Live is great,"},"3818":{"dur":3,"text":"except the sad thing\nabout that is you"},"3821":{"dur":1,"text":"don't know, now, how to improve."},"3822":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Well, somebody\nsaid that the other week."},"3824":{"dur":1,"text":"And they said,\nwell, I've got 100%"},"3826":{"dur":2,"text":"and my tutor said oh, it's\nall downhill from here."},"3828":{"dur":1,"text":"Which, I suppose\nultimately, it is."},"3829":{"dur":2,"text":"PETER TAYLOR: So\none of the things"},"3832":{"dur":2,"text":"that I learned

more\ncomfortable with it,"},"3858":{"dur":4,"text":"I then started to realise that\nthe comments I was getting were"},"3862":{"dur":1,"text":"the ways I could improve it."},"3864":{"dur":2,"text":"And therefore I got\nto a point where"},"3866":{"dur":3,"text":"if I didn't get many\ncomments, I felt quite sad"},"3869":{"dur":3,"text":"because I couldn't think of\nthe ways of improving things."},"3873":{"dur":1,"text":"So I think having\nthose comments,"},"3874":{"dur":3,"text":"but it's the way that you\nstructure the comments."},"3878":{"dur":4,"text":"So rather than saying I\ndon't understand this or this"},"3883":{"dur":1,"text":"is rubbish, actually\nkind of trying"},"3885":{"dur":3,"text":"to understand what\nthe problem
