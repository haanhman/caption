time,"},"63":{"dur":2,"text":"Annapolis seemed to offer\n   the most opportunities."},"67":{"dur":2,"text":"So I put that first\n  in my applications"},"69":{"dur":1,"text":"and was fortunate\n   to be accepted."},"71":{"dur":3,"text":"And then I went\n   off there and had"},"75":{"dur":3,"text":"different choices for\n  career choices in the Navy."},"78":{"dur":1,"text":"And you have to\n   remember back then"},"80":{"dur":3,"text":"the Cold War was still going,\n and the submarine force"},"83":{"dur":2,"text":"is where the action really was."},"85":{"dur":2,"text":"That was the hardest

it?"},"103":{"dur":3,"text":"Tell me about that process and\n really what was that decision"},"106":{"dur":1,"text":"cause, you know, you coulda\n  went to a lot of

tell us\n   about the process"},"116":{"dur":1,"text":"to get in cause it's not easy."},"117":{"dur":2,"text":"- Sure, well actually\n the seed goes back"},"119":{"dur":1,"text":"to when I was in

in high\n   school, and they look for"},"143":{"dur":4,"text":"a well-rounded person\n   more than just the grades."},"147":{"dur":3,"text":"So I was very active in\n athletics and other

the type of person\n they're looking for."},"162":{"dur":3,"text":"So you fill out an application\n to the Naval Academy,"},"165":{"dur":2,"text":"and then in parallel\n  you also apply"},"167":{"dur":3,"text":"for an appointment from\nyour elected officials,"},"170":{"dur":1,"text":"so you can apply to\n both senators and then"},"172":{"dur":2,"text":"the representative\n   for your area."},"174":{"dur":2,"text":"Here in North Dakota\n   traditionally those three"},"177":{"dur":2,"text":"will get together and\n have a combined board,"},"179":{"dur":1,"text":"and then they pick\n   their nominees"},"181":{"dur":1,"text":"for those in the Naval\n Academy, who confirm"},"183":{"dur":2,"text":"they meet the\n minimum requirements,"},"185":{"dur":2,"text":"and then the

activities."},"211":{"dur":4,"text":"- Sure, so the Navy does 12\n  weeks around the country,"},"216":{"dur":3,"text":"and we select areas\nwhere there's generally"},"220":{"dur":2,"text":"strong support for\n   the Armed Forces."},"222":{"dur":2,"text":"And also an area where\n the Navy's not perhaps"},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"well as understood as\n the other

robotics"},"258":{"dur":2,"text":"and things that kids\n  can participate in"},"260":{"dur":2,"text":"and what you're doing and\n where you're going with that."},"263":{"dur":1,"text":"- Sure, there's a couple\nprimary activities."},"264":{"dur":2,"text":"One involves robots, so our"},"267":{"dur":2,"text":"Explosive Ordinance\n  Disposal teams,"},"270":{"dur":2,"text":"the bomb squads if\n  you will, use these"},"272":{"dur":1,"text":"to check out\n  suspicious packages."},"274":{"dur":3,"text":"Very similar to a police\n forces around the country now."},"278":{"dur":2,"text":"And so they'll

[Matt] Wow.\n  - [Stuart] And then we have"},"286":{"dur":5,"text":"a virtual reality display\n   involving navigation"},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"in the undersea\n   environment, and the kids"},"294":{"dur":2,"text":"really like that cause it's\n  sort of close to gaming."},"297":{"dur":3,"text":"But it's an actual simulator\n  that we use for training."},"300":{"dur":1,"text":"- How has the Navy changed\n   over the years, Admiral?"},"302":{"dur":3,"text":"Because, I mean, you've\nbeen on nuclear subs,"},"306":{"dur":2,"text":"you've commanded one, we'll\n get to that in a few minutes,"},"308":{"dur":3,"text":"but a lot of changes\n   technologically since we,"},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"you and I growing up watching\n the World War 2 movies"},"314":{"dur":3,"text":"about the Navy, it's amazing\n  the technology, right?"},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yeah, so I would actually\n  say not only technology"},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"but the people and then the\n  operations that we conduct."},"323":{"dur":4,"text":"So technology of course,\n things of course have advanced"},"327":{"dur":4,"text":"along with the rest of everyday\nlife with microprocessors"},"331":{"dur":3,"text":"and computers and\n everything that we do."},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"And that really has\n  enabled us to become"},"337":{"dur":4,"text":"that much better with the\n   missions that we conduct."},"341":{"dur":1,"text":"The people have\n actually gotten better"},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"than what we used to have."},"345":{"dur":3,"text":"The all-volunteer force when I\n started was still fairly new,"},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"and now it's mainstream\nfor what we do."},"351":{"dur":3,"text":"It's quite extraordinary,\n  the people that we attract."},"354":{"dur":3,"text":"Only about 25% of high school\n graduates actually meet"},"357":{"dur":3,"text":"the minimum criteria for\n   being in the Armed Forces"},"361":{"dur":4,"text":"for being physically fit\n   and the academic aptitude"},"365":{"dur":3,"text":"and free of\n disciplinary problems."},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"So we really do get\n  the best of America."},"371":{"dur":1,"text":"And then operationally,\n   of course, when I started"},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"as I mentioned it\n  was in the Cold War."},"375":{"dur":1,"text":"It's now different,\nwe're around the world,"},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"and we're focusing on\n   many different hot spots."},"379":{"dur":1,"text":"- And what are the differences?"},"381":{"dur":1,"text":"When you started, like\n   you said, it was Cold War,"},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"so Soviet Union was\nstill kind of the focus."},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"Tell me about that and\n   then kinda take me through"},"388":{"dur":2,"text":"your career as well with your\n commands and things like that."},"391":{"dur":1,"text":"- Sure, so when I\n   started, the Soviet Union"},"393":{"dur":3,"text":"really was the singular focus\n of the United States Navy"},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"and the potential for\n warfare with them."},"399":{"dur":3,"text":"And so when the\n  wall fell in Berlin,"},"402":{"dur":3,"text":"things changed pretty\n   markedly and very quickly."},"406":{"dur":3,"text":"And we became more\ndiffuse in what we did,"},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"looking all around the\n  world, controlling the seas,"},"413":{"dur":3,"text":"maintaining the sea\nlanes free for shipping,"},"416":{"dur":1,"text":"and then being\n   available whenever"},"417":{"dur":1,"text":"the hot spots were developed."},"419":{"dur":4,"text":"And of course then we\nhad the Gulf War in '91,"},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"and then continued presence\n  there maintaining civility,"},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"and now we're in an\n era where really it's"},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"a multi-pronged\n   threat that we're"},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"concerned about\n   around the world."},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"We have concerns with Russia\n  with what they've done"},"435":{"dur":3,"text":"in the Ukraine, and where they\n might be headed with that."},"439":{"dur":3,"text":"Concerns with China and a\n  very rapid military buildup."},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"Some coercion in\n  the South China Sea,"},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"and where they're\n   headed with that."},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"The Iranians the\npotential for developing"},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"nuclear weapons and\n  long-range missiles."},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"Same with the North Koreans."},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"And then this long-term\nterrorist threat,"},"457":{"dur":1,"text":"and where that might be going."},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's really a\n   multi-dimensional problem"},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"like we haven't\n   dealt with before."},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"- And how does the Navy fit\n  into that, Admiral Munsch?"},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"Because I think the general\n  public tends to think of"},"470":{"dur":3,"text":"Navy SEALs and the Marines\n   and this kind of thing"},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"and ground troops, that\n  tends to be what politically"},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"people talk about, you\n   know, boots on the ground,"},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"this and that, should we\n   commit boots on the ground"},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"to fight ISIS, et cetera,\n  but what is the Navy's role,"},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"say, in the Middle East\nor the South China Sea"},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"or things like that, up\nin the Korean peninsula?"},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"- Sure, so about one\n  third of the Navy"},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"is deployed overseas\n  at any one time,"},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's to all those areas\n that we just talked about."},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"So by maintaining a\n  continuous presence"},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"in the area, there's two things."},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"One is it deters\n   any potential foe"},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"from committing aggression."},"505":{"dur":1,"text":"And then on the\n   flipside of that,"},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"it assures allies and\nfriends that we're there"},"510":{"dur":3,"text":"to maintain civility, and\n  so we're on the front lines."},"514":{"dur":1,"text":"And if anything\n   starts to go awry,"},"515":{"dur":2,"text":"we're usually the\n first ones to respond."},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"Ships, submarines,\n   aircraft, SEALs."},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"- [Matt] Aircraft take off\n from ships, et cetera, right?"},"523":{"dur":3,"text":"- Exactly, and because we're\n based in international waters,"},"526":{"dur":4,"text":"we really have wide range of\n the earth, and we can operate"},"530":{"dur":4,"text":"from the seas and go\n ashore if we need to."},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"So we often say those\n aircraft carriers"},"536":{"dur":3,"text":"are really four acres of\n   sovereign U.S. territory."},"541":{"dur":1,"text":"- Let em know we're\nthere, right? (laughing)"},"543":{"dur":1,"text":"- Exactly."},"544":{"dur":1,"text":"- Tell me about your career."},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"When you first came\n  out of the Navy,"},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"where were you assigned?"},"549":{"dur":1,"text":"I know eventually, people\n   are very interested,"},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"you commanded a nuclear\nsubmarine, of course."},"553":{"dur":1,"text":"Just take me\n  through your career."},"554":{"dur":3,"text":"Where it took you and\n the various commands."},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"- Sure, I did a\n couple of odd things,"},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"so your viewers\n   should understand"},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"this is not the normal\n path to do things."},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"But I went straight\ninto graduate education"},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"after the Naval Academy,\nand was very fortunate"},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"to be over at Oxford\n University in the U.K."},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"Then it was time for me to\n  play catch-up with my peers."},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"So I did a ballistic missile\n  submarine that carries"},"579":{"dur":3,"text":"the nuclear tip missiles,\n   provides our nation"},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"strategic deterrence, and\n   then I rolled straight"},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"into a fast attack\n   submarine with deployments"},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"out in the Western\nPacific, and then I went"},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"to an aircraft carrier,\nanother unusual thing,"},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"and did a ployment with\n   them to the Arabian Gulf,"},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"and then I was XO of a\nsubmarine out in Hawaii"},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"with more operations\n in the Western Pacific"},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"and the Arabian Gulf, and\n   then finally went ashore."},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"Usually we don't spend\n that much time on sea."},"607":{"dur":1,"text":"And I was at the\nPacific Command,"},"608":{"dur":3,"text":"which is headquartered\n there in Hawaii,"},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"and while there applied for\n  a White House fellowship"},"614":{"dur":3,"text":"and was accepted, and\nso I went off from there"},"617":{"dur":1,"text":"and spent a year\n  in the White House."},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"Another unusual\n thing to do, and then"},"621":{"dur":3,"text":"I went to command Albuquerque,\n the fast attack submarine."},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"And that was based out\nof Groton, Connecticut,"},"627":{"dur":3,"text":"and we deployed two times,\n   once just in the Atlantic,"},"630":{"dur":4,"text":"and another time continuing\n  on to the Arabian Gulf."},"634":{"dur":3,"text":"That's then when I got my\nfirst Pentagon tour after that,"},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"and it seems like now that's\n  kinda my default place to be"},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"when I'm not on the sea tour."},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"And I've worked for the\n  Deputy Secretary of Defense"},"646":{"dur":1,"text":"as his military\n   assistant, and then I went"},"648":{"dur":3,"text":"to the Director of Submarine\n  Warfare after that,"},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"which is the plans\n   and policy office,"},"653":{"dur":3,"text":"budget office for\n  the submarine force."},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"And then commanded a\n squadron of submarines"},"659":{"dur":3,"text":"out in Washington State, then\n it was back to the Pentagon"},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"where I headed Navy\n  strategy for a year"},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"and then was selected\n to become an admiral,"},"668":{"dur":3,"text":"and so I was back in the\nsubmarine warfare office"},"672":{"dur":4,"text":"for two years and then out\n   in Japan for two years,"},"676":{"dur":1,"text":"where I commanded all\nour deployed submarines"},"677":{"dur":4,"text":"in the Western Pacific\nand the Central Command"},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"in the Arabian Gulf area."},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"And now I'm back\nin the Pentagon,"},"685":{"dur":2,"text":"and again back working for the\n Deputy Secretary of Defense."},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"- Very impressive."},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"What's it like to\n   be deployed for"},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"a long period of time on a sub?"},"693":{"dur":3,"text":"That must be really, you know,\n we've seen movies about it,"},"697":{"dur":1,"text":"but what is that like?"},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"That's gotta be stressful for\n some people, I would think,"},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"but what's it like to be in\ncommand of something like that?"},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"- It's sort of the ultimate\n  command in the Navy"},"708":{"dur":1,"text":"because you're out there alone"},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"without a lot of communications."},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"It's really quite a\n bit of responsibility"},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"to give an officer at\n the commander level"},"716":{"dur":3,"text":"to execute national policy\n   and really be on his own."},"720":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's very rewarding,\nand our operations"},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"on fast attack submarines,\n   which I've done primarily,"},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"are very\nforward-operating areas."},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"We're continuously adding\n  intelligence in peace time,"},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"and of course are\n ready with our weapons"},"736":{"dur":1,"text":"if we go into combat."},"738":{"dur":4,"text":"The longest we'll go is really\n limited by our food on board,"},"742":{"dur":3,"text":"and that's 90 days is a\n   standard load-out of food."},"746":{"dur":3,"text":"Personally I've done 76 days."},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"To a degree it can be a\n little bit like Groundhog Day"},"752":{"dur":1,"text":"for parts of the\n  crew that are doing"},"754":{"dur":3,"text":"the same thing every day,\ncause they don't all understand"},"758":{"dur":3,"text":"or are allowed to know the\n  operations that we're doing."},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"But those of us that are doing"},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"the operations\n everyday is exciting."},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"- Is it something\n   you get used to,"},"767":{"dur":1,"text":"being away from your\n  family that long?"},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm always curious about that."},"770":{"dur":2,"text":"Is there claustrophobia, is\n that something you're used to"},"772":{"dur":2,"text":"by the time you get command\n  of something like that?"},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"Take me through the\nmental strain, I guess."},"778":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yeah, it's actually\n not that big a deal."},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"- [Matt] It sounds like it\n   is to me, or the layman."},"784":{"dur":1,"text":"- Everybody who's in\n  the submarine force"},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"is a volunteer, so those\nthat might have issues"},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"tend to self-select out\nand do something else."},"791":{"dur":1,"text":"And then if you start\n  doing it when you're young,"},"792":{"dur":3,"text":"it's just sort of\n what you grow up with."},"796":{"dur":3,"text":"So everybody does like to get\n out in the sun when we're done"},"800":{"dur":2,"text":"and the young sailors now,\n  the other priority is to get"},"803":{"dur":4,"text":"on a Wi-Fi net and get\nconnected again with the world."},"807":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Matt] With the world."},"808":{"dur":1,"text":"Is it tough on the family\n   to be away that long?"},"810":{"dur":2,"text":"- It is."},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"Among the various\ncommunities in the Navy,"},"814":{"dur":2,"text":"the submarine force is really\n known for close-knit families"},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"and strong support\n   for one another,"},"819":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's really necessary\n with the business that we do."},"822":{"dur":1,"text":"- You told me before\n  we started recording"},"824":{"dur":1,"text":"you really liked\n  your time in Japan."},"825":{"dur":1,"text":"Why is that?"},"827":{"dur":2,"text":"- I did, it's a\n   wonderful country."},"829":{"dur":3,"text":"The people unfailingly\nare gracious and

well."},"839":{"dur":3,"text":"Everything's very\n clean, no petty theft,"},"843":{"dur":3,"text":"and everything's\n  very punctual there."},"846":{"dur":2,"text":"Everything happens right when\n it's scheduled to happen,"},"848":{"dur":2,"text":"so it's really just a\n pleasure to live there"},"851":{"dur":1,"text":"and get to know them."},"852":{"dur":3,"text":"- With Navy Week as we're\n here, is that really a chance"},"856":{"dur":2,"text":"for you guys to sell\nthe Navy to people too?"},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"This is what a Navy career\n   is like, is that kind of"},"861":{"dur":2,"text":"a PR thing for you guys as well?"},"863":{"dur":1,"text":"Tell me about that,\n maybe you're reaching"},"865":{"dur":3,"text":"maybe that kid who might\n  choose the Navy as a career."},"869":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yes, we do spend\n time explaining that."},"871":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's an opportunity\n to see the world"},"874":{"dur":1,"text":"and go on deployments,\n things that you"},"876":{"dur":3,"text":"might not be able to do\nhere in North Dakota."},"879":{"dur":3,"text":"It's an opportunity to pick\n  up additional skillsets."},"883":{"dur":4,"text":"Most
