can\nfind the money some place,"},"152":{"dur":3,"text":"to make sure that one area\nin particular is funded."},"155":{"dur":1,"text":"But there certainly are others."},"157":{"dur":2,"text":"- I know there was talk\nand of course there was"},"159":{"dur":2,"text":"in budgets, was this\nprovider assessment,"},"162":{"dur":1,"text":"which could have been up to 5%,"},"163":{"dur":2,"text":"but that

the reason."},"170":{"dur":2,"text":"North Dakota is one of a\nhandful of sates that has"},"172":{"dur":1,"text":"what's called rate equalization."},"174":{"dur":3,"text":"And that means that if a\nmember of your family is in"},"178":{"dur":2,"text":"a long-term care facility\non their own money,"},"181":{"dur":2,"text":"because they have been\nfortunate to be financially"},"183":{"dur":2,"text":"successful or they've\nsaved and been careful"},"186":{"dur":2,"text":"or they had family\nmembers or whatever,"},"188":{"dur":1,"text":"they are on their own

their own way,\nthey would be on Medicaid."},"198":{"dur":2,"text":"They need to get\nthe same services."},"200":{"dur":3,"text":"So the state before I\neven came to the Senate,"},"203":{"dur":3,"text":"passed legislation that says\nthe rates have to be equal"},"206":{"dur":3,"text":"so whatever the Medicaid\nrate is that's reimbursed"},"209":{"dur":3,"text":"by the sate of North Dakota,\nthe private pay patient"},"212":{"dur":1,"text":"cannot pay more than that."},"214":{"dur":1,"text":"So what's happened\nis a triple-hit"},"216":{"dur":2,"text":"to the long-term\ncare facilities."},"218":{"dur":2,"text":"They had a reduction\nin the Medicaid rate,"},"220":{"dur":2,"text":"which meant they had a\nreduction then called for in the"},"223":{"dur":1,"text":"private pay rate\nthey can charge,"},"225":{"dur":2,"text":"and there's a reduction\nin the federal match"},"227":{"dur":2,"text":"because we have a 50-50\nmatch from the feds"},"229":{"dur":1,"text":"for our Medicaid money."},"231":{"dur":3,"text":"So they have really taken\na nasty hit with this."},"235":{"dur":2,"text":"- Is this something that\nyou think you can solve?"},"237":{"dur":2,"text":"Are solutions\nbeing talked about?"},"239":{"dur":2,"text":"- Oh yes, all the\ntime, absolutely."},"241":{"dur":3,"text":"But, my view of\nthis, provider text,"},"245":{"dur":2,"text":"was that it's an end\nwe're on around the law"},"248":{"dur":3,"text":"which is rate equalization\nand I support that concept"},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"and I would hope that we\ndon't have to do anything"},"253":{"dur":1,"text":"to jeporodize that."},"255":{"dur":2,"text":"- I'd have more, well a lot of\nissues before your committee,"},"257":{"dur":3,"text":"but there's one that really\nyou're with right now,"},"261":{"dur":2,"text":"because I think you're under\nthe gun to get the bill out"},"263":{"dur":3,"text":"and that's what's going to\nhappen with medical marijuana."},"266":{"dur":1,"text":"- In fact when I leave\nhere we're going back to"},"268":{"dur":3,"text":"I hope finish that up\nfor our part right now."},"271":{"dur":3,"text":"But yes, we absolutely\nunderstand that the voters"},"275":{"dur":3,"text":"want to have medical\nmarijuana available."},"278":{"dur":1,"text":"(clearing throat) Excuse me."},"279":{"dur":2,"text":"But the initiated\nmeasure that was passed"},"282":{"dur":3,"text":"was a cut and paste effort\nfrom several different states,"},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"and absolutely unworkable."},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"The really big deal\nthat nobody noticed"},"289":{"dur":2,"text":"and what some people think\nis a perfect document,"},"292":{"dur":3,"text":"is that they didn't bother\nto decriminalize marijuana,"},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"so you could grow it\nand you could buy it,"},"298":{"dur":3,"text":"but if you possessed it,\nyou would be a criminal."},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"So one of the big\nthings in the bill"},"303":{"dur":2,"text":"that's being considered, 2344,"},"306":{"dur":2,"text":"will be to deal with that issue."},"308":{"dur":2,"text":"To make sure that somebody\nwho possess medical marijuana"},"311":{"dur":1,"text":"will not be charged\nwith a crime,"},"312":{"dur":1,"text":"even though federally of course,"},"314":{"dur":2,"text":"it's still a\ncontrolled substance."},"316":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, and that's where\neverything gets a little bit"},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"murky because you've got\nthe federals that say"},"321":{"dur":1,"text":"it's still a schedule one drug."},"322":{"dur":1,"text":"- Absolutely."},"323":{"dur":4,"text":"- And you have the states\nsaying, and states are now"},"328":{"dur":2,"text":"adopting laws to have\nmedical marijuana,"},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"so there's a conflict there."},"332":{"dur":4,"text":"And then you had the conflict\nthat if it wasn't solved"},"338":{"dur":4,"text":"by the amendment that you\nhave about decriminalization,"},"342":{"dur":1,"text":"we got a crime in North Dakota\n- Exactly."},"344":{"dur":2,"text":"- so there are a lot of\nmoving parts to this."},"346":{"dur":3,"text":"- And we don't know what the\nnew federal administration"},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"will do, whether or not\nthe new Attorney General"},"352":{"dur":3,"text":"will go back to enforcing\nthat federal law"},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"about it being a forbidden drug,"},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"or will it be-- will they\ncontinue to look the other way?"},"362":{"dur":3,"text":"I should mention though,\nthat there are several things"},"365":{"dur":3,"text":"on a list for those states\nthat have implemented"},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"medical marijuana that the\nfederal Attorney General's"},"372":{"dur":4,"text":"office is not focusing\non giving a lot of static"},"378":{"dur":2,"text":"to the states that meet\ncertain criteria in that area,"},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"which we are trying to do\nwith this bill as well,"},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"so that we will be\nable to manage that."},"385":{"dur":1,"text":"So we're trying to set\nup a structure that the"},"386":{"dur":3,"text":"Health Department can handle,\nthat we can afford to do,"},"390":{"dur":1,"text":"that will make the product"},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"available in forms\nthat people can use,"},"394":{"dur":1,"text":"that we protect children."},"395":{"dur":1,"text":"Not only children\nwho are taking this,"},"396":{"dur":1,"text":"whose parents want\nthem to have it,"},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"but children who might be\nat home where a marijuana"},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"product is consumed."},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"So there are a lot of\nmoving parts to this bill,"},"405":{"dur":1,"text":"you're right."},"406":{"dur":1,"text":"- One of the things that\nI hear from the proponents"},"408":{"dur":3,"text":"of medical marijuana\nis they didn't like the"},"411":{"dur":4,"text":"original bill because it didn't\nallow for smoking marijuana."},"415":{"dur":1,"text":"- Well and we're looking."},"417":{"dur":1,"text":"That's part of our\njob this afternoon"},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"is to look at some\nlatitude there."},"420":{"dur":3,"text":"But quite frankly, if we just\nlet it go the way it was in"},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"the initiated measure, everybody\ncould grow it and smoke it"},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"and do whatever and\nit would be everywhere"},"429":{"dur":1,"text":"and there would be a\nproliferation that would"},"431":{"dur":3,"text":"absolutely be a terrible\nchallenge for law enforcement."},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"They're not quite sure how\nthey're gonna handle all this"},"436":{"dur":1,"text":"as it is because some\nof the other states,"},"438":{"dur":3,"text":"Colorado in particular, has\na really awful situation"},"442":{"dur":1,"text":"going on in so many ways"},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"and we are trying to implement\nsomething that can be done"},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"strategically in a\nfashion that it is,"},"449":{"dur":3,"text":"that it's workable, that it\ndoes what the voters wanted,"},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"because they want it\nand we're doing our best"},"454":{"dur":1,"text":"to provide that."},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"But that it won't be wide\nopen because it's much harder"},"457":{"dur":3,"text":"to bring things back,\nbut that it will enable"},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"a structure to be put\nin place that we can"},"462":{"dur":4,"text":"actually pay for, that the\nHealth Department can manage,"},"467":{"dur":3,"text":"and make it available in a\nvariety of different forms."},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"- And another\nargument against it,"},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"the bill that was introduced,"},"474":{"dur":3,"text":"was what some perceive\nas very high fees for"},"478":{"dur":3,"text":"compassion centers,\nfor grow operations,"},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"or for distillery operations."},"484":{"dur":4,"text":"But the amendments I've seen\nkind of reduce those fees."},"488":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yes, they are."},"489":{"dur":3,"text":"And actually they're quite\ncomparable to other states."},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"And we have to have a way\nto make this self-supporting"},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"after this biennium."},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"So as this moves forward, if\nthere are, perish the thought,"},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"more people who get\ninto marijuana use,"},"502":{"dur":3,"text":"but as it moves forward,\nif there are more people"},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"than what we are estimating\nand the Health Department's"},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"doing its best but we have"},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"no data to really\nhelp us with that,"},"511":{"dur":3,"text":"the fees could be reduced,\nbecause the goal is to make it"},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"self-sufficient, but\nnot into a money-maker."},"518":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yes."},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"And well that makes sense"},"520":{"dur":3,"text":"that you have it pay\nfor itself eventually."},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yep, we have start up costs\nright now and there will be"},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"some state funding in\nthere to help with that."},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"But ultimately, it'll\ntake about a year to get"},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"everything in place."},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"And then there will be a\nyear during which fees can be"},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"collected from the\nmanufacturers which can grow"},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"and manufacture, and then\nfrom the dispensaries,"},"540":{"dur":1,"text":"who can dispense."},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"One of those cannot\ndo the other function."},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"There have to be two\nseparate entities for that."},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"- Now this just\ncame to me just now."},"549":{"dur":3,"text":"Is there certain\nreciprocates, for example,"},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"if California has\nmedical marijuana,"},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"can somebody come from\nCalifornia to North Dakota"},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"and bring medical\nmarijuana with him or her?"},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"- Only if they have dealt\nwith a North Dakota physician,"},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"in a face-to-face meeting\nis what we're looking at"},"565":{"dur":3,"text":"having it be so that\nthere isn't some kind of,"},"568":{"dur":3,"text":"not some responsible physician\nsomewhere who's got a heck"},"572":{"dur":3,"text":"of a good internet business,\nbut so that if it's really"},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"medical, then we need\nto have a physician"},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"who's licensed here who\nindicates that this individual"},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"has one of those conditions\nfor which this treatment"},"583":{"dur":3,"text":"would be an acceptable\ntreatment for their symptoms."},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"- Would it be safe to say\nthat the state wants to err"},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"on the side of caution\nwhile still providing"},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"what voters wanted?"},"593":{"dur":1,"text":"- Exactly."},"595":{"dur":1,"text":"And we're trying to come\nto a good balance there."},"596":{"dur":3,"text":"We really do know\nthat our obligation"},"600":{"dur":1,"text":"is to implement it."},"602":{"dur":1,"text":"But as it was written--"},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"I would be willing to\nbet a very nice lunch,"},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"that most people who read five\nor six lines on the ballot"},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"did not read the 35 pages or\nso of the initiated measure."},"612":{"dur":3,"text":"So when they think they\nknow what they voted for,"},"616":{"dur":1,"text":"they're thinking about\nwhat they voted for,"},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"but they don't necessarily\nknow what they voted for."},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"- Okay, so this bill\nwill help clarify that"},"622":{"dur":1,"text":"as much as you can.\n- Absolutely."},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"And we want the public\nto know the reasons why"},"626":{"dur":1,"text":"we're doing each of these things"},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"and what our alternatives were."},"629":{"dur":4,"text":"And the alternative to a\ntwo-thirds vote in both houses"},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"is that we would go back\nto the initiated measure"},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"which would be almost\nimpossible to implement at all."},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"- Now that brings an\ninteresting point,"},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"because you need\na two-thirds vote,"},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"because it's amending\nan initiated measure."},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"- Exactly because the\nlegislature is always"},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"very reluctant to\noverturn something that"},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"the voters have put in place."},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's why this is a\nbig deal for us to look"},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"at doing it this way, but\nbecause it can't really"},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"be done the way the\nmeasure was written,"},"660":{"dur":4,"text":"we have to have, it\npoints out the importance"},"664":{"dur":2,"text":"of us having an agreement\namong the various"},"666":{"dur":3,"text":"legislators in both houses\nto come to some consensus"},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"because we have to\nhave a two-thirds vote,"},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"both in house and in the senate"},"674":{"dur":1,"text":"and a governor's\nsignature of course,"},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"in order to override\nthe initiated measure."},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"- But if I were betting too,\nI would bet this would be"},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"a fairly lively, spirited\ndebate on the floor."},"683":{"dur":1,"text":"- It could be."},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"But this has also been a\nvery bi-partisan effort"},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"in the Senate working on\nthis and we have put in"},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"a fair amount of time\nand we've had wonderful"},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"assistance from the\nAttorney General's office"},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"and the Health Department\nand law enforcement"},"695":{"dur":1,"text":"and a variety of players who"},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"know more about it than we do."},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"So we know it's not perfect,\nas it leaves the Senate,"},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"when it will, this\nweek or next week,"},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"next week actually, and there\nwill be other amendments"},"705":{"dur":1,"text":"in the house I'm sure."},"707":{"dur":1,"text":"They will have another\ndiscussion about it,"},"708":{"dur":1,"text":"so this is not over."},"709":{"dur":1,"text":"I am pretty sure this\nis going to end up in a"},"711":{"dur":1,"text":"conference committee\nin one of those"},"712":{"dur":1,"text":"last weeks of the Senate"},"713":{"dur":1,"text":"of the legislature.\n- Would it be, would"},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"this be a conference committee\none would like to go to"},"717":{"dur":1,"text":"to hear the discussion?"},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"- I think people might be\ninterested in hearing about"},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"it, absolutely."},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"So it'll be something that\nI hope news organizations"},"724":{"dur":1,"text":"will cover as well."},"725":{"dur":1,"text":"- Now when we talked about\nit earlier in the session,"},"727":{"dur":3,"text":"you did talk about incrementally\ngetting this bill in"},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"and I think if you get\nthis amendment through"},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"and you see some\nproblems with it,"},"736":{"dur":1,"text":"well you're back in two years."},"738":{"dur":1,"text":"- Exactly."},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"And we have as I\nmentioned, it's gonna take"},"740":{"dur":1,"text":"about a year to set this up."},"742":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, as soon as\nthey're able to do it,"},"743":{"dur":1,"text":"it will be done."},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"But in

is a pretty remarkable\nfast-track that that's on."},"754":{"dur":1,"text":"- It's a truncated track."},"755":{"dur":1,"text":"- Absolutely."},"757":{"dur":2,"text":"But we know that, that's\nthe whole benefit of having"},"760":{"dur":1,"text":"another legislative\nsession coming up."},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"We will have one year\nof experience with it."},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"We'll be able to see what\nworks and what isn't."},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"And it can be fixed so that\nthe wishes of the voters"},"768":{"dur":2,"text":"will be implemented in\nthe best possible way."},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"If we mess it up, then\nit becomes harder to fix"},"773":{"dur":1,"text":"as bad things get in place."},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"Inappropriately addressed\nthings get in

house,\nof the Medicaid Match?"},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"- I can't answer\nthat, I'm sorry."},"792":{"dur":1,"text":"I'd rather not tell\nyou that answer,"},"793":{"dur":3,"text":"but we are-- but the F-Map,\nthe federal medical assistance"},"799":{"dur":4,"text":"payment, is the F-Map,\nand we have been at 50%"},"803":{"dur":1,"text":"for a long time now."},"804":{"dur":2,"text":"That's because our\neconomy is strong."},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"And if we were in a\nreally bad economy,"},"809":{"dur":1,"text":"then we would have more\nmoney from the feds,"},"811":{"dur":1,"text":"but I'd rather
