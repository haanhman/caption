text."},"299":{"dur":2,"text":"So, tiny fragments"},"302":{"dur":4,"text":"we actually managed to put back in the right place."},"306":{"dur":3,"text":"Then, having done that, we started to image the

two images in a different way,"},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"you can actually get rid of the prayer book text."},"395":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is terribly important,"},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"because the

the manuscript,"},"418":{"dur":4,"text":"and we decided to image it in X-ray fluorescence imaging."},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"So an X-ray comes in in the diagram on the left"},"426":{"dur":3,"text":"and it knocks out an electron from the inner shell of an atom."},"429":{"dur":1,"text":"And that electron disappears."},"431":{"dur":3,"text":"And as it disappears, an electron from a shell farther out"},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"jumps in and takes its place."},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"And when it takes its place,"},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"it sheds electromagnetic radiation."},"442":{"dur":1,"text":"It sheds an X-ray."},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"And this X-ray is specific in its wavelength"},"446":{"dur":1,"text":"to the atom that it hits."},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"And what we wanted to get"},"450":{"dur":1,"text":"was the iron."},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"Because the ink was written in iron."},"454":{"dur":1,"text":"And if we can map"},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"where this X-ray that comes out, where it comes from,"},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"we can map all the iron on the page,"},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"then theoretically we can read the image."},"462":{"dur":4,"text":"The thing is that you need a very powerful light source to do this."},"467":{"dur":3,"text":"So we took it to the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation

light,"},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"they shed X-rays."},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is the most powerful light source in the solar system."},"493":{"dur":1,"text":"This is called synchrotron radiation,"},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's normally used to look at things"},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"like proteins and that sort of thing."},"498":{"dur":3,"text":"But we wanted it to look at atoms, at iron atoms,"},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"so that we could read the page from before and after."},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"And lo and behold, we found that we could do it."},"508":{"dur":3,"text":"It took about 17 minutes to do a single page."},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"So what did we discover?"},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"Well one of the unique texts in Archimedes"},"516":{"dur":1,"text":"is called \"The Stomachion.\""},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"And this didn't exist in Codices A and B."},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"And we knew that it involved this square."},"523":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is a perfect square,"},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's divided into 14 bits."},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"But no one knew what Archimedes was doing with these 14 bits."},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"And now we think we know."},"531":{"dur":1,"text":"He was trying to work out"},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"how many ways you can recombine those 14 bits"},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"and still make a perfect square."},"538":{"dur":3,"text":"Anyone want to guess the answer?"},"541":{"dur":5,"text":"It's 17,152 divided into 536 families."},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"And the important point about this"},"549":{"dur":3,"text":"is that it's the earliest study in combinatorics in mathematics."},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"And combinatorics is a wonderful and interesting branch of
