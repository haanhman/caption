this, people"},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"assume that you are Asian."},"426":{"dur":5,"text":"But it was kind of just like\na category you checked off."},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"I was, for the most,\nI was Korean American"},"434":{"dur":1,"text":"and whatever that means."},"436":{"dur":7,"text":"For me, I actually went to\ncollege at Northwestern."},"443":{"dur":3,"text":"And being plucked from the\nBay

took Asian American"},"482":{"dur":4,"text":"Studies courses in college,\nwhich was just like for me,"},"487":{"dur":3,"text":"it was the beginning of a\nlot of different things."},"490":{"dur":4,"text":"It was a wake up call\nin terms of my adapting"},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"Asian American as a\npolitical identity."},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"Not just something\nthat I checked off,"},"498":{"dur":5,"text":"but something I purposely\nwore on my sleeve."},"504":{"dur":1,"text":"So now when people ask me--"},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean like it's clear\nI'm like I'm Asian."},"507":{"dur":3,"text":"But I'm usually asked, I'm\nusually I'm Asian American."},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"And then the other identity\nis Korean American."},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"But as a

that."},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"Because I mean we've\nalready touched upon this,"},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"but like I think a lot\nof people don't realize"},"526":{"dur":3,"text":"they're Asian

you."},"542":{"dur":1,"text":"You're Asian whether\nyou like it or not."},"543":{"dur":5,"text":"And so however you embrace\nthat, it's up to you."},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"So when you get\nhere, a lot of people"},"550":{"dur":3,"text":"are still resistant to\nthe idea of being Asian."},"554":{"dur":6,"text":"But I think that as\nan organizing tool,"},"560":{"dur":4,"text":"Asian is a super inconvenient\nconvenient unwieldy term"},"565":{"dur":3,"text":"for a lot of different groups\nand people, but very necessary."},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"And so that's sort of, at\nleast from the beginning"},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"of my journey in college\nwhen I sort of became aware"},"574":{"dur":5,"text":"as my history and my\nidentity, I think,"},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"where I wanted to-\nand I decided--"},"582":{"dur":1,"text":"that's the thing."},"583":{"dur":3,"text":"Being Asian, I think is Asian\nAmerican, it's an opt in."},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"It's an opt in identity."},"587":{"dur":1,"text":"You have to opt in to\nbeing Asian American."},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"You can go on being Chinese\nAmerican, Korean American,"},"591":{"dur":1,"text":"or whatever."},"593":{"dur":5,"text":"But I think that you have to\nchoose to be Asian American."},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"VALARIE KAUR: Well, race\nfirst came alive to me"},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"through
