four"},"1130":{"dur":3,"text":"projects, but this is a\nvery early thing that we did"},"1133":{"dur":2,"text":"as a collaboration with\nthe artist Carson Holler."},"1136":{"dur":4,"text":"And the idea was that everything\nwas being made out of snow,"},"1140":{"dur":2,"text":"and it was done in\nnorthern Finland."},"1142":{"dur":2,"text":"And those of you who\nknow Holler's work,"},"1145":{"dur":3,"text":"he works a lot with slides\nand the idea of movement."},"1149":{"dur":3,"text":"And it was our idea that we\nnot have a visible slide,"},"1153":{"dur":1,"text":"but we have a kind\nof buried slide."},"1155":{"dur":1,"text":"So this was the\nplaster model that we"},"1156":{"dur":4,"text":"had done of the idea\nwhere you would slide down"},"1161":{"dur":1,"text":"through that hole,\nbut then you'd"},"1162":{"dur":3,"text":"walk out through the\nsort of curving paths."},"1166":{"dur":1,"text":"So all that needed\nto be made was"},"1167":{"dur":4,"text":"a meter high cake of\nsnow, which you could get,"},"1172":{"dur":1,"text":"could happen here."},"1173":{"dur":4,"text":"And then you'd climb up\non that table of snow"},"1177":{"dur":3,"text":"and slide down into\nthe center actually."},"1181":{"dur":3,"text":"This was done in Rovaniemi."},"1184":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah."},"1185":{"dur":0,"text":"Where the--"},"1186":{"dur":1,"text":"Here the guys were\ncutting the snow"},"1188":{"dur":4,"text":"into the-- the dish on which\nthe-- all you needed also"},"1192":{"dur":2,"text":"was a hollow that was a little\ndeeper than that meter of snow."},"1195":{"dur":2,"text":"So it was actually\ntwo meters deep."},"1198":{"dur":3,"text":"And you sort of didn't\nnotice it actually--"},"1201":{"dur":0,"text":"I mean--"},"1202":{"dur":0,"text":"came up on it."},"1203":{"dur":2,"text":"And actually this was way\nbefore we went to India"},"1205":{"dur":1,"text":"and saw the stepwells."},"1207":{"dur":4,"text":"But it was this desire to\ncreate an experience that"},"1211":{"dur":6,"text":"went down into the ground and\nhad a very indistinct

dinner,"},"1282":{"dur":3,"text":"where the people had dinner,\nwhere people could gather"},"1285":{"dur":2,"text":"was this little library\ncalled Savage Library."},"1288":{"dur":3,"text":"And it

so--"},"1299":{"dur":1,"text":"And the one room had\na fireplace in it"},"1301":{"dur":1,"text":"and that wasn't very\ngood for the books."},"1303":{"dur":0,"text":"So--"},"1304":{"dur":5,"text":"And without a vestibule and\nwithout with a fireplace,"},"1309":{"dur":5,"text":"without any thermal barriers,\nthis really was unsatisfactory."},"1315":{"dur":2,"text":"But furthermore, as\na one room

really\na good place to for 25 people"},"1327":{"dur":1,"text":"to find a book."},"1328":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is a very small project\nfor us but a very special one"},"1332":{"dur":3,"text":"because we really liked\nthis idea of the MacDowell."},"1336":{"dur":1,"text":"We went to the site."},"1337":{"dur":3,"text":"And here you can see the small\nlibrary building, and then"},"1341":{"dur":3,"text":"this very large rock,\nwhich was nearby."},"1344":{"dur":4,"text":"And so we decided we would make\nthe addition to the library"},"1349":{"dur":2,"text":"thinking about this large rock."},"1351":{"dur":2,"text":"So, the colony haul\nis up to the right,"},"1353":{"dur":3,"text":"and our drawing of our\naddition is down at the bottom."},"1356":{"dur":1,"text":"This is a finished drawing."},"1358":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's the\nlibrary to the right,"},"1359":{"dur":3,"text":"and then this odd\nlittle low

library was not,"},"1369":{"dur":4,"text":"which is that it was multiple\nspaces and a small labyrinth."},"1374":{"dur":1,"text":"But it was subservient\nto the library."},"1376":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is a drawing."},"1378":{"dur":1,"text":"We're trying to\nwork out the plan."},"1379":{"dur":1,"text":"And it became a little\nsimpler than this,"},"1381":{"dur":1,"text":"but it more or less\nworked that you"},"1383":{"dur":2,"text":"would walk, slide\ninto actually-- it's"},"1385":{"dur":2,"text":"a little later, so that's a\nfireplace because we couldn't"},"1388":{"dur":2,"text":"use this fireplace anymore,\nan outdoor fireplace"},"1390":{"dur":1,"text":"to triangulate the space."},"1392":{"dur":2,"text":"Walking in under the eaves\ninto a

toilets,"},"1414":{"dur":2,"text":"and-- cause there weren't\nany toilets, an incline"},"1416":{"dur":1,"text":"and a kitchen, and a gallery."},"1418":{"dur":2,"text":"So, it's a super small building."},"1420":{"dur":2,"text":"We also then\nrenovated this, which"},"1423":{"dur":2,"text":"really not going to show it so."},"1425":{"dur":4,"text":"So the building bent itself\naround that large rock which"},"1429":{"dur":1,"text":"is very, very beautiful rock."},"1431":{"dur":0,"text":"Yes."},"1432":{"dur":2,"text":"And then this idea\nof the fireplace"},"1434":{"dur":2,"text":"being the hearth that\nmoves to the outside"},"1437":{"dur":2,"text":"was very important to us."},"1439":{"dur":3,"text":"And we were talking today\nabout flat roof buildings."},"1443":{"dur":3,"text":"And

against the window."},"1466":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is the plan that\nwas ultimately made."},"1469":{"dur":2,"text":"So it is the building--"},"1471":{"dur":1,"text":"We worked with

it's kind of\nplaced to which one"},"1522":{"dur":2,"text":"walks the rock is\njust behind it,"},"1524":{"dur":3,"text":"and then our building is\nlower than the

almost a--\nit's a-- we were talking today"},"1548":{"dur":4,"text":"about space being a\nseries of experiences."},"1553":{"dur":2,"text":"So, this is a series\nof places to

this,"},"1569":{"dur":1,"text":"at a screen that's over here."},"1570":{"dur":2,"text":"And of course the\nartists that are there"},"1572":{"dur":2,"text":"are screenwriters\nand composers and so"},"1575":{"dur":3,"text":"things don't necessarily fit\non shelves in a normal way."},"1581":{"dur":1,"text":"This is just after\nthe landscape went in."},"1583":{"dur":2,"text":"They're all sorts

extraordinary,\nand the balance"},"1614":{"dur":2,"text":"of the ordinary\nand extraordinary."},"1617":{"dur":4,"text":"So in many ways these are two\nextremely ordinary

completely"},"1643":{"dur":1,"text":"subservient to the land."},"1644":{"dur":3,"text":"So, it is in the place of\na parking lot that existed."},"1647":{"dur":2,"text":"And the parking lot\nwas

that"},"1656":{"dur":2,"text":"wasn't really useful for reuse."},"1658":{"dur":3,"text":"And what we did is we took\nthat debris and repacked it"},"1662":{"dur":2,"text":"and created a mound\nthat

that were two\none-story buildings"},"1673":{"dur":2,"text":"that had no interior stairs."},"1675":{"dur":4,"text":"And used the landscape for\negress and the landscape"},"1680":{"dur":4,"text":"So that this in Haverford\nCollege is an arboretum,"},"1685":{"dur":3,"text":"and so we said, well the\narboretum is the living room."},"1688":{"dur":1,"text":"And then we placed\nour buildings

the UVA's."},"1726":{"dur":0,"text":"It's pathetic."},"1727":{"dur":1,"text":"But, I mean, sorry."},"1728":{"dur":1,"text":"It has two stairs."},"1730":{"dur":0,"text":"It has an elevator."},"1731":{"dur":3,"text":"It has a living element down\nat one end and services."},"1734":{"dur":2,"text":"And we looked at this\nand said if you actually"},"1737":{"dur":2,"text":"would expand that\ncorridor you could"},"1739":{"dur":3,"text":"get the same number of\nrooms, and you would then"},"1742":{"dur":3,"text":"have interesting communities\nwith more connections"},"1746":{"dur":1,"text":"This becomes the courtyard."},"1748":{"dur":2,"text":"And so if you look at the\n10,000 square feet of space"},"1751":{"dur":2,"text":"has, in this case,\n700 feet of perimeter."},"1754":{"dur":1,"text":"In this case, 570."},"1756":{"dur":3,"text":"But the common space here\nis 3,560 square feet."},"1759":{"dur":1,"text":"And here it's 2,950."},"1761":{"dur":2,"text":"So, it's an unexpected\npayoff, and it"},"1764":{"dur":2,"text":"enabled since we had no\nstairs and no elevators"},"1766":{"dur":3,"text":"we were able to build higher\nquality at lower cost, which"},"1770":{"dur":3,"text":"to me makes this a small\nrevolutionary building."},"1773":{"dur":2,"text":"The students each\nwanted singles which"},"1775":{"dur":3,"text":"made our life more difficult\nbecause that meant more rooms."},"1779":{"dur":2,"text":"But we also designed very\nsimple furniture for
