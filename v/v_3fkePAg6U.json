to\nopen."},"1020":{"dur":5,"text":"So they're sort of impatient."},"1025":{"dur":6,"text":"And so, you see, not just Honey, but about\nninety percent of our monkeys ended up shopping"},"1031":{"dur":1,"text":"at Justin."},"1032":{"dur":3,"text":"So if I said to say, the monkeys pick up on\nmany things in our market that we pick up"},"1036":{"dur":1,"text":"on when we're

irrational?\""},"1061":{"dur":3,"text":"And to do that, what we did was to give the\nmonkeys basically the same scenario that you"},"1065":{"dur":1,"text":"guys did."},"1066":{"dur":3,"text":"Here's the first one that you did, you're\ngetting extra food than you expect."},"1070":{"dur":3,"text":"And so to test that, we introduce to the monkeys\ntwo new traders, Vlad and

more than two in the bush."},"1203":{"dur":1,"text":"They seem to show that effect, as well."},"1204":{"dur":4,"text":"And a lot of the problems we tested them on,\nthey seem to be just as irrational

cases"},"1216":{"dur":2,"text":"are the monkeys are more rational than we\nare."},"1219":{"dur":3,"text":"And this was the kind of thing that we were\nthinking of as we started a kind of new line"},"1222":{"dur":4,"text":"of studies to just sort of probe a bit, \"Are\nthere spots where people meekly, kind of dumb,"},"1227":{"dur":2,"text":"come to the choices we make?\""},"1229":{"dur":3,"text":"And this led us to start doing some work on\nwhat is called \"Price Effects\", or effects"},"1232":{"dur":1,"text":"of price on value."},"1234":{"dur":4,"text":"And this is what we worked on with two undergrads\nat Yale, Nick Butchtrick and Nia Catatonyo"},"1238":{"dur":2,"text":"who did this work for their Senior Honors\nTheses."},"1241":{"dur":1,"text":"But what's this pricing effect?"},"1242":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, the pricing effect is that I can affect\nyour subjective preference, your actual taste"},"1247":{"dur":4,"text":"of a particular good by telling you something\ndifferent about its price."},"1252":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, if the Museum of Natural History wanted\nto run a study, they could've just left the"},"1256":{"dur":2,"text":"prices out at different wines that you were\npurchasing."},"1259":{"dur":4,"text":"And if they were holding the same wine, and\ncalling out a hundred dollars, it would taste"},"1263":{"dur":4,"text":"better to you than if they were giving you\nexactly the same one and calling it ten dollars."},"1268":{"dur":3,"text":"And you can see almost doubling of preference\nwhen I just lie to you and tell you the wine"},"1272":{"dur":1,"text":"cost more."},"1273":{"dur":3,"text":"You might think these are just cheesy undergrads\nwho don't really know anything about wine,"},"1277":{"dur":4,"text":"and they can get messed up, but in fact, they're\nnot just saying they like to get more, if"},"1281":{"dur":4,"text":"you use brain scanning FMRI techniques and\nyou look at their reward regions, the regions"},"1286":{"dur":3,"text":"of their brain that would fire if they had\naccess to things like sex, or money, or really"},"1290":{"dur":6,"text":"sweet foods, those regions fire differently\nfor exactly the same wine just told that you're"},"1296":{"dur":1,"text":"charging more for it."},"1297":{"dur":3,"text":"And so what we wanted to do is to see the\nsame effects in monkeys."},"1301":{"dur":3,"text":"And the cool thing was that from our first\nset of studies, we knew that the monkeys understood"},"1304":{"dur":1,"text":"price."},"1305":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, they understood price so well, my\neconomist colleague was like, \"You can't even"},"1308":{"dur":2,"text":"tell their data from a human's data.\""},"1311":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we try to do something a little bit\ndifferent, this time we introduced the monkeys"},"1315":{"dur":4,"text":"to new brands of food, just to see if we can\nget the price effects there."},"1319":{"dur":4,"text":"And so now, the monkeys meet experimenters\nwho are selling little goods in boxes, so"},"1323":{"dur":3,"text":"they meet the clover-brand and the moon-brand."},"1326":{"dur":3,"text":"And the monkeys are getting little boxes of\ncereal, so it's the same food, but kind of"},"1330":{"dur":1,"text":"a different brand."},"1331":{"dur":3,"text":"We did this because this is the spot where\nhumans show all these pricing effects, typically"},"1334":{"dur":2,"text":"it's different brands of the same kind of\nthing, where you can't tell the difference"},"1337":{"dur":1,"text":"very much."},"1338":{"dur":3,"text":"But the monkeys meet these two guys and they\nget to choose between them, when they have"},"1342":{"dur":1,"text":"equal price."},"1343":{"dur":3,"text":"And then what we do is we make one of the\ngoods a little bit cheaper."},"1346":{"dur":4,"text":"So now, the Moon-Brand has just gone on sale,\nif you get three times as much food from the"},"1350":{"dur":1,"text":"Moon-Brand as you do from the Clover-Brand."},"1352":{"dur":3,"text":"And so this guy suddenly becomes cheap, this\nguy is still pretty expensive."},"1356":{"dur":4,"text":"And if the monkeys understand prices, we think\nthey do, they should shift their consumption"},"1360":{"dur":1,"text":"more to the cheap good."},"1361":{"dur":3,"text":"It'd be like if your favorite brand of wine,\nif you have two wines, you like equally one"},"1365":{"dur":3,"text":"wine, super wine on sale, you might buy more\nof that one when you went to the store."},"1368":{"dur":3,"text":"And so what we wanted to see if the monkeys\ndid this, here's a graph representing how"},"1371":{"dur":4,"text":"often they choose the good that's eventually\ngoing to be cheap, here's what all the monkeys"},"1376":{"dur":3,"text":"do before one's cheap, they just don't care."},"1379":{"dur":3,"text":"Once comes cheap, they all shop and just buy\nthat good, us totally."},"1382":{"dur":2,"text":"So they get the price and they get this information."},"1384":{"dur":4,"text":"Question is, \"Does it affect how much they\nlike this thing?"},"1388":{"dur":4,"text":"When the thing, when they find out some novel\ngood is really cheap, versus it's really expensive,"},"1393":{"dur":2,"text":"does it affect what they actually like?\""},"1395":{"dur":4,"text":"And so to do that we did a different version\nof the study, and I'll explain the set-up"},"1399":{"dur":1,"text":"first and then I'll show you what we did."},"1401":{"dur":3,"text":"So we imagine that the monkeys come in and\nthey get to shop just at this guy, so they"},"1405":{"dur":3,"text":"don't have a choice and they buy from the\nHorse Shoe-Brand they realize, \"Huh, the Horse"},"1408":{"dur":3,"text":"Shoe is kind of expensive, I only want to\nget one,\" They meet a totally new symbol,"},"1412":{"dur":2,"text":"which should be a new symbol, but imagine\nit's a Horse Shoe, or something."},"1415":{"dur":3,"text":"So they think the new symbol guy, and they\nshop at him and realize, \"Wow, this is really"},"1418":{"dur":1,"text":"cheap.\""},"1419":{"dur":2,"text":"And they shop at this guy, \"Oh, he's really\nexpensive, this guy is really cheap.\""},"1422":{"dur":4,"text":"And so now we do the interesting part of the\nexperiment, which is now imagine that instead"},"1427":{"dur":3,"text":"of you having to purchase the wine, it's just\nfree."},"1430":{"dur":4,"text":"So you might like the hundred dollar wine\nat the Museum of Natural History better, but,"},"1434":{"dur":3,"text":"you know, maybe you don't want to pay a hundred\ndollars a glass for a tiny glass of wine."},"1438":{"dur":3,"text":"But, if all of a sudden, a donor came and\nsaid, \"Let's just give away free wine.\""},"1442":{"dur":1,"text":"Which wine would you pick?"},"1443":{"dur":2,"text":"Would you pick the hundred dollar one or the\nten dollar one?"},"1445":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is the choice we give the monkeys,\nnow they come in for their normal testing,"},"1449":{"dur":1,"text":"except they don't have a wallet."},"1450":{"dur":1,"text":"But there's no traders."},"1452":{"dur":3,"text":"Boxes of the food are just there, they can\neat as much as they want."},"1455":{"dur":3,"text":"And the question is, \"Will they selectively\neat the expensive one?\""},"1458":{"dur":4,"text":"In other words, will they now come to prefer\nthe one that has become expensive."},"1463":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, now, I'm going to plot for you how\noften the monkeys pick the cheaper or expensive"},"1467":{"dur":4,"text":"good, the the cheap is yellow, the expensive\nis in orange, and this is basically the flattest,"},"1471":{"dur":3,"text":"perfect effect of no effect we could possibly\nhave seen."},"1474":{"dur":1,"text":"The monkeys just don't care."},"1476":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we said, \"Hmm, this is puzzling, maybe\nit's because we did these weird cheap and"},"1480":{"dur":4,"text":"expensive brands, we've now tried it with\ncheap and expensive novel foods, cheap and"},"1484":{"dur":4,"text":"expensive familiar foods, they just don't\nshow this effect across a bunch of studies."},"1488":{"dur":2,"text":"It seems like they kind of just don't care.\""},"1490":{"dur":5,"text":"This is the first irrationality we've seen\nthat seems to be true in us, but not in them,"},"1495":{"dur":1,"text":"even though they understand the price."},"1497":{"dur":1,"text":"So we're trying to figure out what's going\non."},"1498":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, it can't be that they don't understand\nthe price, because we know they get that,"},"1502":{"dur":3,"text":"and in the way an economist might respect."},"1505":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we worried that it might be something\nelse, \"Well, maybe the monkey market is kind"},"1508":{"dur":3,"text":"of a little bit different than our market,\nit doesn't really have supply and demand in"},"1511":{"dur":3,"text":"the same way, maybe they're missing something\ncritical in the way they learn their market,"},"1515":{"dur":4,"text":"that we kind of get, that makes us think that\nexpensive goods usually are much better.\""},"1520":{"dur":5,"text":"But we worry that we were missing something\nthat purely economic explanation, and the"},"1526":{"dur":3,"text":"reason we were worried is this: I'm sort of\nthinking, \"What do I think when I'm buying"},"1529":{"dur":1,"text":"an expensive wine?\""},"1530":{"dur":4,"text":"Am I thinking about supply and demand, and\nlike, all these economics principles that"},"1534":{"dur":5,"text":"I've forgot, from like, my freshman year of\ncollege, no, I'm thinking, \"Rich people like"},"1540":{"dur":1,"text":"this expensive wine.\""},"1541":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm thinking of what other people are thinking."},"1543":{"dur":4,"text":"And we started thinking that maybe the monkeys\nare using the price as a cue to what other"},"1547":{"dur":2,"text":"people think and what other people believe."},"1550":{"dur":2,"text":"And we had this intuition in part because\nwe were watching the news."},"1553":{"dur":5,"text":"This is the news on the Apple Store downtown\nwhen the new iPhone 5

the audience,\nI feel embarrassed for you, alright?"},"1567":{"dur":1,"text":"But why are these people doing it?"},"1568":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, they could like the iPhone just because\nit's really expensive, or they could be taking"},"1572":{"dur":4,"text":"it as a signal of the price of the new iPhone,\nwhich mind you, which is the same as the iPhone"},"1576":{"dur":2,"text":"4, whatever it is, but more expensive."},"1579":{"dur":3,"text":"They could be taking the price information,\nbut my guess is that the price is a signal"},"1582":{"dur":1,"text":"for social information."},"1583":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a signal that other people like it."},"1586":{"dur":1,"text":"Important people like this thing."},"1587":{"dur":4,"text":"And so we worried maybe this is the spot that\nmonkeys are differing from us, maybe they"},"1592":{"dur":4,"text":"are not as susceptible to the dumb social\nthings we see other agents doing."},"1597":{"dur":4,"text":"The
