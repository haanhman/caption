they\ndon't know how to take notes."},"61":{"dur":1,"text":"So how can people take\nnotes through this?"},"63":{"dur":3,"text":"And what about what we\nsay is actually important?"},"66":{"dur":1,"text":"NICKY HARLOW: Yes,\na lot of questions."},"68":{"dur":0,"text":"And it's bigger."},"69":{"dur":1,"text":"As you go through\nin your studies,"},"70":{"dur":1,"text":"it becomes bigger and bigger."},"72":{"dur":2,"text":"The main thing\nabout taking notes"},"75":{"dur":1,"text":"is that you have\na resource

thing."},"82":{"dur":1,"text":"It's an aid memoir."},"84":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's to help the\ninformation go in."},"87":{"dur":3,"text":"So you may want to take\nnotes from your module

Brilliant."},"130":{"dur":2,"text":"NICKY HARLOW: So the very\nfirst chapter in that book"},"132":{"dur":2,"text":"happens to be the\nidea of authority."},"134":{"dur":2,"text":"And all I did was

getting it in my head."},"153":{"dur":2,"text":"And then when I go back, I will\nlook at the various things,"},"156":{"dur":2,"text":"like, what is a religious\ntext in

asking yourself,"},"168":{"dur":3,"text":"do I understand this?"},"171":{"dur":3,"text":"I was guilty of this when\nI was a level one student."},"175":{"dur":2,"text":"I would sit and diligently\npore through books."},"177":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Oh,\nI used to do that."},"178":{"dur":1,"text":"And I used to write\nloads and loads."},"180":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I'd end up with a\n40-page

need to\ndo is ask yourself"},"195":{"dur":1,"text":"questions all the time."},"196":{"dur":3,"text":"And one way to do this is to\nskim read your chapter first,"},"200":{"dur":3,"text":"so a quick sort of\nrushing through it."},"203":{"dur":4,"text":"And pay special attention to\nheadings and anything in bold."},"208":{"dur":2,"text":"And you might want to\nunderline some

those."},"222":{"dur":1,"text":"And then read it again."},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"And then that's when I\nwould do this sort of thing."},"227":{"dur":0,"text":"Scribble notes."},"228":{"dur":1,"text":"And it doesn't have\nto be Post-it Notes."},"229":{"dur":2,"text":"It can be in any way."},"231":{"dur":2,"text":"And try and summarise\nin your own

say"},"289":{"dur":2,"text":"you're engaging with\nan activity or a forum,"},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"or whatever, when should\nyou be taking those notes?"},"294":{"dur":1,"text":"And I guess, how\ndo

talking"},"309":{"dur":4,"text":"a lot about initial concepts,\nglossaries, understanding"},"313":{"dur":2,"text":"what the different\nwords mean that you're"},"315":{"dur":1,"text":"going to come across."},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"At level two, you'll be\ngoing into a different area."},"319":{"dur":4,"text":"You might want to store your\nwork in tables or diagrams,"},"324":{"dur":2,"text":"so you can actually\nlink through,"},"326":{"dur":2,"text":"for instance, something\nthat's in a DVD."},"329":{"dur":1,"text":"You could link\nthrough to something"},"330":{"dur":3,"text":"that's in a book or something\nthat you've heard in a lecture."},"333":{"dur":3,"text":"So you might want to produce\na nice, neat table, which I"},"337":{"dur":1,"text":"haven't done today, I'm afraid."},"338":{"dur":3,"text":"But you can produce a table\nlinking different concepts."},"341":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: OK."},"342":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, what would the\npoint then of making it"},"344":{"dur":3,"text":"into a table as opposed\nto a format like that be?"},"347":{"dur":1,"text":"NICKY HARLOW: Well,\nif I got a question"},"349":{"dur":3,"text":"on an idea of authority,\nand I happened"},"352":{"dur":4,"text":"to watch a film about,\nsay, Anne Bronte,"},"356":{"dur":3,"text":"and I think, well, how\ndoes she link to authority?"},"360":{"dur":3,"text":"I could then look

then"},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"link aspects of her text."},"370":{"dur":2,"text":"So you might have different\nheadings, such as,"},"373":{"dur":1,"text":"what is your

there?"},"388":{"dur":1,"text":"What if you get\nsomething, and you think,"},"389":{"dur":1,"text":"right, I'm looking at\nthree different examples"},"391":{"dur":0,"text":"of various
