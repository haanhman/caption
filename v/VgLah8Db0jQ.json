sketches."},"54":{"dur":1,"text":"And you starred in it."},"55":{"dur":0,"text":"DEMETRI MARTIN: Yes."},"56":{"dur":3,"text":"DEMETRI MARTIN: It's a lot of\nhubris involved in that

writing getting\nall the way to filming."},"67":{"dur":0,"text":"DEMETRI MARTIN: Yeah."},"68":{"dur":2,"text":"So I mostly do stand-up comedy."},"70":{"dur":2,"text":"And I got into stand-up\nto do stand-up."},"72":{"dur":1,"text":"I like writing jokes."},"74":{"dur":1,"text":"And I like telling them."},"75":{"dur":2,"text":"I feel lucky that I\ncan do it as a job."},"78":{"dur":1,"text":"I found a way to\nmake money doing it."},"80":{"dur":4,"text":"But along the way, mostly in\nmy notebooks, just from writing"},"85":{"dur":2,"text":"jokes by hand, which\nI still like to do."},"87":{"dur":1,"text":"I type them into\nmy phone sometimes."},"89":{"dur":1,"text":"But usually I'll carry\na little notebook,"},"90":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'll just write down ideas."},"93":{"dur":2,"text":"Along the way, doing\nthat every day,"},"96":{"dur":1,"text":"other ideas started to come out."},"97":{"dur":2,"text":"Sometimes they were drawings,\njust little line drawings."},"100":{"dur":1,"text":"And sometimes, I don't\nknow, like an idea"},"102":{"dur":4,"text":"for a book or a short story\nand movie ideas were in there."},"106":{"dur":2,"text":"Most of them were\nhigher concept."},"108":{"dur":2,"text":"For whatever reason, I\nwas drawn to the idea"},"110":{"dur":4,"text":"of making movies about outer\nspace or, I don't know,"},"115":{"dur":1,"text":"underwater, or\nwhatever that hell I"},"116":{"dur":1,"text":"thought I was going to do."},"118":{"dur":2,"text":"But then I did sell a couple\nof pitches over the years."},"121":{"dur":3,"text":"And I got money for the\nscripts, which was cool."},"125":{"dur":2,"text":"I had this free club soda\nthat you guys gave me."},"128":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you for that."},"129":{"dur":2,"text":"I chose poorly, cause I'm gonna\nburp through my conversation."},"132":{"dur":1,"text":"But I love this mixed\nberry thing here."},"134":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not sponsored\nby them or anything."},"135":{"dur":1,"text":"NADIA OUAZZI: No."},"137":{"dur":0,"text":"DEMETRI MARTIN: Yeah."},"138":{"dur":2,"text":"So after I sold those\npitches, I thought, hey,"},"140":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going to get to make\nthese concepty movies that"},"143":{"dur":1,"text":"will get made in Hollywood."},"144":{"dur":1,"text":"And maybe I'll get to\nplay a part in them."},"145":{"dur":1,"text":"But they never got made."},"147":{"dur":1,"text":"So it was nice to get money."},"148":{"dur":1,"text":"But it never went anywhere."},"150":{"dur":2,"text":"So after some years,\nI decided if I'm"},"152":{"dur":2,"text":"going to have a shot at making\nmovies I'll have to write"},"154":{"dur":2,"text":"them myself for myself."},"157":{"dur":0,"text":"And I'll direct them."},"158":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'll learn how to\ndo each of these roles"},"161":{"dur":1,"text":"so that I can have\ncreative control"},"162":{"dur":4,"text":"and also get the thing\nmade, make it happen."},"167":{"dur":2,"text":"And then after that I\nrealized, well, I'll"},"169":{"dur":2,"text":"have to write a small\nidea, because no one's"},"171":{"dur":2,"text":"going to give me money\nto do a big movie."},"174":{"dur":4,"text":"So I wrote this one, which is\na very personal, smaller story,"},"178":{"dur":1,"text":"I guess you could say."},"180":{"dur":0,"text":"I was lucky."},"181":{"dur":2,"text":"I got Kevin Kline to\nplay my dad in the movie."},"183":{"dur":1,"text":"And that made it a real movie."},"184":{"dur":1,"text":"That helped me\nget the financing."},"185":{"dur":2,"text":"A lot of it came together when\nKevin responded to the script"},"188":{"dur":1,"text":"and said he would do it."},"189":{"dur":4,"text":"So that was like a big\nleap in the process"},"194":{"dur":2,"text":"that kind of got me down\nthe road to actually making"},"197":{"dur":1,"text":"the movie."},"198":{"dur":1,"text":"Took a while, though."},"199":{"dur":0,"text":"It's weird."},"200":{"dur":3,"text":"When you make a small indie film\nlike this one, nobody cares."},"204":{"dur":1,"text":"Nobody's waiting for it."},"206":{"dur":4,"text":"So you have to hustle and try\nto find your way through it."},"211":{"dur":1,"text":"But I did."},"212":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'm grateful now, because\nI have a finished movie,"},"215":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's actually going to be in\nmovie theaters, which there was"},"217":{"dur":1,"text":"no guarantee that would happen."},"219":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'm trying to\nfocus on that and not"},"221":{"dur":5,"text":"worry about how well it'll do\nor just how nasty people will"},"226":{"dur":1,"text":"be online."},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, I don't think\nthere's anything--"},"230":{"dur":1,"text":"NADIA OUAZZI: I think they're\ngoing to be very nice."},"232":{"dur":0,"text":"DEMETRI MARTIN: --that\nwill provoke that."},"233":{"dur":1,"text":"But of course, you know."},"234":{"dur":3,"text":"I think it's a colder\nworld these days."},"237":{"dur":4,"text":"So making something heartfelt\nhas a certain scariness to it."},"242":{"dur":1,"text":"NADIA OUAZZI: Definitely."},"243":{"dur":1,"text":"Very vulnerable."},"244":{"dur":0,"text":"DEMETRI MARTIN: Yeah."},"245":{"dur":3,"text":"It's certainly more vulnerable\nthan I've been in my stand-up."},"249":{"dur":4,"text":"I like doing jokes about chairs\nand trees and stuff like that."},"254":{"dur":2,"text":"So those are safe\ntopics usually."},"256":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is more of a--"},"257":{"dur":1,"text":"even added like, you fucker!"},"259":{"dur":1,"text":"That was a racist chair."},"260":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, I didn't know."},"261":{"dur":0,"text":"How?"},"262":{"dur":0,"text":"It was about a chair."},"263":{"dur":0,"text":"Whatever."},"266":{"dur":1,"text":"My mother was a chair,\nyou piece of shit!"},"268":{"dur":0,"text":"Fuck!"},"269":{"dur":0,"text":"What?"},"272":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is more about grief and\nloss and it's a personal thing."},"277":{"dur":1,"text":"NADIA OUAZZI: How long\ndid it take you to write"},"279":{"dur":1,"text":"the script all the way through?"},"280":{"dur":0,"text":"I don't know."},"281":{"dur":0,"text":"I was trying to do the math."},"282":{"dur":0,"text":"Someone else asked me."},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"I think I started writing\nit about five years ago."},"285":{"dur":0,"text":"And then I stopped."},"286":{"dur":3,"text":"And I went to some other idea\nthat I thought would be--"},"289":{"dur":1,"text":"again, it was a\nhigher concept thing."},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was around\nthen that I realized,"},"293":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not going to\nget money for this."},"294":{"dur":3,"text":"So I went back to this one."},"298":{"dur":4,"text":"I shot it in 2014."},"302":{"dur":1,"text":"So it is about\nthree years old just"},"304":{"dur":3,"text":"from the filming to now release."},"307":{"dur":3,"text":"I sold the movie a year ago\nat the Tribeca Film Festival."},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"Not the one that just\nhappened, but a year back."},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"And now finally it will be out."},"315":{"dur":1,"text":"So some time has\npassed in there."},"316":{"dur":1,"text":"It hasn't changed\nin the last year."},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"It's just been sitting there\nwaiting to show it to people."},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"But the writing took--"},"323":{"dur":4,"text":"I don't know if it took on and\noff about a year or nine months"},"327":{"dur":1,"text":"or, I don't know,\nsomething like that."},"329":{"dur":1,"text":"NADIA OUAZZI: And\nwhat do you think"},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"you've learned about yourself\nin the process of making"},"333":{"dur":1,"text":"this film?"},"334":{"dur":1,"text":"DEMETRI MARTIN:\nWell, a few things."},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"Stand-up doesn't teach you\nhow to work with others."},"338":{"dur":6,"text":"It really teaches you vigilance\nand self-reliance, fear."},"344":{"dur":5,"text":"Just if you're in a live show\nsituation, any sudden movement,"},"350":{"dur":1,"text":"it's a very\nprimordial experience."},"351":{"dur":1,"text":"You're like, that's a threat."},"352":{"dur":1,"text":"Like, this guy is coming."},"353":{"dur":0,"text":"He has to pee."},"354":{"dur":0,"text":"Cool."},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"He's fine."},"357":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's a very self-contained,\noften solitary experience."},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"Traveling-- I'm basically\nlike a traveling salesman."},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"I just go to a\ncity, do the show,"},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"get back in the rental car,\nreturn it the next morning"},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"at the airport, go to\nthe next city, et cetera."},"370":{"dur":2,"text":"Making a movie taught me a lot\nabout how I work with others."},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"And I found some\ngreat collaborators,"},"376":{"dur":1,"text":"which is wonderful."},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"My DP was great."},"379":{"dur":1,"text":"My art director."},"381":{"dur":1,"text":"I loved the cast."},"383":{"dur":1,"text":"I got to cast the movie."},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"So I got time to\nreally pick people."},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"And I thought a lot about\nwhat my day-to-day life would"},"388":{"dur":1,"text":"be like making the movie."},"389":{"dur":3,"text":"Not just the end product\nthat I wanted, but process."},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm sure many of you have\nencountered this in your work--"},"395":{"dur":1,"text":"just how important process is."},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"I just want to\nlike what I'm doing"},"399":{"dur":2,"text":"and not chase\nachievements so much."},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"But ideally have them\nbe maybe the byproduct"},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"of a process that I enjoy."},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"So I don't know what I learned\nspecifically about myself"},"411":{"dur":3,"text":"there other than I\nlearned that how much I"},"414":{"dur":1,"text":"do like working\nwith other people"},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"and having colleagues,\nwhich I don't usually"},"418":{"dur":0,"text":"have as a comedian."},"419":{"dur":1,"text":"I like the freedom\nof being a comedian."},"420":{"dur":1,"text":"But as I'm getting\na little older,"},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"it's nice eating lunch\nwith other people"},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"and having conversations\nduring the day,"},"426":{"dur":1,"text":"rather than just\nwalking around the city"},"428":{"dur":3,"text":"like a drifter listening\nto my iPod or whatever."},"432":{"dur":1,"text":"The other thing I\nlearned was, I got"},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"to see my nose from\nevery angle in the edit."},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"And this was a\ndifficult experience."},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"I know what I look like."},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"But, man."},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"It's nice to write and direct\nand star in your own thing."},"442":{"dur":1,"text":"But man, you get\nwhat you ask for."},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"Cause I'm sitting there in\nthe edit for months, just"},"446":{"dur":0,"text":"like, whew."},"447":{"dur":0,"text":"Let's use that."},"448":{"dur":1,"text":"That's the best take."},"449":{"dur":0,"text":"I'll get over it."},"450":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll get over myself."},"451":{"dur":1,"text":"The world knows\nwhat I look like."},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"I just wasn't quite aware of it."},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"Now I do."},"455":{"dur":0,"text":"It's tough."},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"NADIA OUAZZI: When you're doing\nstand and prepping for that,"},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"is your writing\nroutine or method?"},"460":{"dur":3,"text":"Just walking around and just\nwaiting for ideas to come?"},"464":{"dur":0,"text":"DEMETRI MARTIN: Yeah."},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"I did most of my\nstand-up in New York."},"467":{"dur":0,"text":"I started in New York."},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"And I lived there for 14 years."},"470":{"dur":4,"text":"So most of my writing process\nwas walking around the city,"},"474":{"dur":3,"text":"hopping on the train,\ngoing into a coffee shop,"},"478":{"dur":4,"text":"always with a notebook,\ndrawing, writing, daydreaming."},"482":{"dur":4,"text":"I learned along the way to\nbe less critical of my self"},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"as I was generating material."},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"And I've developed\na tolerance for how"},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"shitty a lot of the\nstuff I come up with is."},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"Whereas I think early\non I was discouraged,"},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"because I would write a\njoke and be, that's stupid."},"500":{"dur":1,"text":"It's-- whatever."},"502":{"dur":1,"text":"And then over time I\nwas like, you know what?"},"504":{"dur":2,"text":"I think it's important\nto write those down."},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"Don't worry about it."},"508":{"dur":1,"text":"Just generate the content."},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"And hopefully in quantity\nI might find quality."},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"And I have found that for\nme mostly to be the case."},"514":{"dur":1,"text":"I have to sift through\na lot of stuff."},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"But when I go to make a project,\nI look through my notebooks--"},"518":{"dur":1,"text":"I have a lot of them now\nfrom over the years--"},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"and I can just look\nthrough and find--"},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"I wrote that as a joke idea."},"523":{"dur":1,"text":"It didn't work as\na stand-up joke."},"525":{"dur":1,"text":"But that actually might\nbe a piece of dialogue"},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"for a character to say."},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"And this single panel\ndrawing could actually"},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"be a character for an\nanimated film idea."},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"Or here's a short story\nI hadn't thought of."},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"But this one joke\nsuggests to me-- you know,"},"538":{"dur":1,"text":"you look at your old stuff."},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"And I don't remember something\nthat I wrote in a notebook"},"542":{"dur":2,"text":"on a random day in 2005."},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"So I get to rediscover\nsome of the old ideas."},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's always been a\npart of the process for me."},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"I moved to California."},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"I live in a canyon."},"552":{"dur":1,"text":"We don't have sidewalks."},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"If I want to go for a walk,\nI'm gonna get hit by a car"},"556":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's not going\nto help my process."},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"So I've got to figure\nout a way to walk,"},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"because I think\nkinesthetically for me"},"563":{"dur":1,"text":"it actually helps me\nto generate ideas."},"565":{"dur":3,"text":"Sitting in one place\nin just a white room"},"568":{"dur":3,"text":"would probably not\nhelp me so much."},"571":{"dur":3,"text":"That to me leads to analysis--"},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"self-analysis-- dovetails\nnicely into some self-hatred."},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I'm off\nto the races there."},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"So I don't do that."},"582":{"dur":1,"text":"So I got a treadmill desk."},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"And I have a treadmill\ndesk in like a little shed"},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"in my backyard."},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"And I just get on there when\nI'm home in the morning."},"590":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's like I have weird\nvitamins I have to take."},"593":{"dur":1,"text":"Like, I have to write\na page of jokes."},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"If I want to do a new stand-up\nspecial, which I'm going to do,"},"598":{"dur":3,"text":"So just open up a Word\ndocument and just put the date"},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"and just write jokes\nuntil I get to the bottom."},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I kind of put\nthat in a folder and work"},"607":{"dur":1,"text":"on whatever script\nI'm trying to write"},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"or a comedy essay or whatever."},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"Do my email and all that stuff."},"613":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's turned out to\nbe a wonderful metaphor"},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"for Hollywood, because\nI'm just going nowhere."},"620":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm just walking literally\non a treadmill everyday,"},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"just trying to write my movies\nthat nobody's asking for."},"626":{"dur":1,"text":"NADIA OUAZZI: It's\na good metaphor."},"628":{"dur":0,"text":"Yeah."},"629":{"dur":0,"text":"NADIA OUAZZI: It's nice."},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"So going back to early days."},"632":{"dur":3,"text":"So in my thorough\nresearch for this talk,"},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"you were in law school."},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"And then a full\nride for law school."},"640":{"dur":3,"text":"And then on the second out of\nthree years, you

Yes."},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"I went right to law\nschool out of college."},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"And I had a scholarship,\nwhich was nice."},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"So I didn't have to accrue debt."},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"Can I accrue?"},"657":{"dur":0,"text":"Am I using that word?"},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"Or does it accrue itself?"},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"Whatever."},"660":{"dur":0,"text":"I didn't have debt."},"661":{"dur":1,"text":"That's all."},"663":{"dur":3,"text":"My vocabulary is shrinking\nas I get further into comedy."},"667":{"dur":5,"text":"So I thought I would be\na public interest lawyer."},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"And then shortly after\ngetting into law school,"},"674":{"dur":4,"text":"I just realized that I don't\ncare enough about other people."},"679":{"dur":1,"text":"That's not true."},"680":{"dur":1,"text":"It might be true."},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"But more that I just\nwasn't suited for law."},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'm not that\nthorough a person."},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think I found when\nI was in law school,"},"688":{"dur":4,"text":"it seemed to require\na lot of thoroughness."},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"I write short jokes."},"694":{"dur":3,"text":"And I don't think\nthat's by mistake."},"697":{"dur":3,"text":"Once I get a punchline or two\noff a topic, I'm kind of spent."},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"So I move to the next one."},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"So to do legal research and\nall that, let alone have"},"706":{"dur":4,"text":"somebody's financial future or\nfreedom in my hands, was like,"},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not suited for that."},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"NADIA OUAZZI: And were you\nthe class clown growing up?"},"714":{"dur":1,"text":"Or was comedy the\nnatural choice?"},"716":{"dur":1,"text":"DEMETRI MARTIN: No, I\nwasn't the class clown."},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"But I think I got\nlast with my friends."},"719":{"dur":1,"text":"My dad was a really\nfunny person."},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"So I was around\nsomeone who was funny."},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"But then in law school I\nbecame kind of the class clown."},"725":{"dur":3,"text":"And that was a bad\nsign, because--"},"729":{"dur":0,"text":"how you doing?"},"730":{"dur":0,"text":"What's up?"},"734":{"dur":4,"text":"Just doing crowd work for the\npeople on the other campuses."},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"A couple of people\nentered the room."},"742":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes, but then in\nlaw school I think"},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"I was trying to be funny,\nbecause it was like a mismatch."},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was trying to break\nout of it or something."},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"NADIA OUAZZI: And what was\nyour first stand-up set like?"},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"DEMETRI MARTIN: My first set I\ndid I think about six minutes."},"753":{"dur":3,"text":"And I did 12 jokes."},"757":{"dur":1,"text":"God bless you."},"758":{"dur":0,"text":"Somebody sneezed."},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"It was not like a Jesus--"},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"it's not like a\nreligious moment."},"764":{"dur":4,"text":"Bless you for asking that\nquestion about my past."},"768":{"dur":0,"text":"Yeah."},"769":{"dur":1,"text":"And about six of them worked."},"771":{"dur":0,"text":"Yeah."},"772":{"dur":2,"text":"I was totally psyched."},"774":{"dur":1,"text":"And then I actually\nhad booked it"},"776":{"dur":1,"text":"so that I did stand-up\na Monday night."},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"This open mic was my first\nthing in a comedy club."},"780":{"dur":4,"text":"And the second night was the\nvery next night, Tuesday,"},"785":{"dur":3,"text":"in a bar called Ye Old\nTriple Inn in Manhattan."},"788":{"dur":1,"text":"It was on 55th Street."},"790":{"dur":1,"text":"There was a small\ncomedy show there."},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"So I did the second\nnight right after."},"794":{"dur":2,"text":"So I figured, I'm gonna\nbomb the first night."},"797":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll pick myself\nback up, and I'll"},"798":{"dur":2,"text":"try again the next night so I\ncan just kind of get this over"},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"with and feel what\nit's like to bomb."},"803":{"dur":1,"text":"The first night\nwent really well."},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"So now I was excited\nbecause I said, great."},"808":{"dur":1,"text":"This material
