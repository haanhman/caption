account\nunder a fake name,"},"151":{"dur":2,"text":"which was Mike Smith--\nnot a very creative name."},"154":{"dur":3,"text":"And at first I did pretty well."},"157":{"dur":1,"text":"And I made some money,\ntotally randomly."},"159":{"dur":1,"text":"It wasn't because I\nknew what I was doing,"},"161":{"dur":2,"text":"although I think at the\ntime I thought I did."},"163":{"dur":3,"text":"And then after a while, I\nsort of started to lose."},"166":{"dur":2,"text":"And I realized--\nbasically the reason"},"168":{"dur":1,"text":"I had started in\nthe first place,"},"170":{"dur":1,"text":"it wasn't because\nI loved horses."},"171":{"dur":2,"text":"It wasn't because I thought\nthis is an incredibly"},"173":{"dur":1,"text":"beautiful sport or anything."},"174":{"dur":1,"text":"I just liked the\nidea that here was"},"176":{"dur":3,"text":"something where you could make\nmoney just by using your mind."},"180":{"dur":1,"text":"And I was kind of lazy."},"182":{"dur":2,"text":"And I thought well, I don't\nwant to mow lawns or anything."},"184":{"dur":2,"text":"And here if I can just sort of\ninvest a little bit of money"},"187":{"dur":2,"text":"on a horse race and make\nsome money, that's fantastic."},"190":{"dur":2,"text":"And when I started to\nlose, I just thought,"},"193":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to stop cold turkey."},"194":{"dur":2,"text":"And literally I stopped\nat the

20s,\nI discovered the stock market."},"218":{"dur":3,"text":"And then I thought wow, now\nthis is what I was really after."},"221":{"dur":1,"text":"This is the real game."},"222":{"dur":2,"text":"Because again, this is somewhere\nwhere, if you're smart,"},"225":{"dur":2,"text":"you can use your brain\njust to make money"},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"without really

and\nlater for \"Fortune\" and \"Time.\""},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I got to interview all\nsorts of famous investors."},"254":{"dur":2,"text":"So I would, for\nexample, I would get"},"256":{"dur":2,"text":"to interview Peter\nLynch or Jeff Vinik who"},"258":{"dur":2,"text":"was managing the biggest\nmutual fund in the world"},"260":{"dur":7,"text":"when he was in his early

well"},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"for many years as investors."},"305":{"dur":3,"text":"And I sort of figured,\nwhat if you could reverse"},"308":{"dur":2,"text":"engineer these people\nand figure out why"},"310":{"dur":1,"text":"it is that they win this game?"},"312":{"dur":3,"text":"How do they stack the odds so\nthat they win as investors?"},"315":{"dur":1,"text":"What characteristics\ndo they have"},"317":{"dur":2,"text":"in terms of temperament,\nin terms of principles,"},"319":{"dur":1,"text":"in terms of insights?"},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"And is there any way that\nI could learn to do this?"},"323":{"dur":1,"text":"Then over the last\ncouple of years"},"324":{"dur":2,"text":"I was working on this book,\n\"The Great Minds of Investing,\""},"327":{"dur":2,"text":"where I had this opportunity--\nin the end I interviewed"},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"I think 22 of these\nguys and I wrote"},"332":{"dur":3,"text":"profiles of 22 famous investors\nand edited profiles of several"},"335":{"dur":1,"text":"more."},"337":{"dur":2,"text":"And by this time,\npart of what happens"},"339":{"dur":2,"text":"I think when you hit\nyour 40s is that you"},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"start to suffer from all\nsorts of existential angst."},"344":{"dur":1,"text":"So instead of just\nthinking, how do"},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"I get rich by reverse\nengineering these people,"},"348":{"dur":1,"text":"you start to think,\nwell how do I live?"},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"How do I make better decisions?"},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"How do I eradicate what\nCharlie Munger would"},"354":{"dur":1,"text":"call standard stupidities?"},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"How do we make good\ndecisions in the face"},"360":{"dur":1,"text":"of a very

balance my family,\nwho are here-- so obviously not"},"370":{"dur":5,"text":"very well-- my family, my\nwork, all of these things?"},"376":{"dur":2,"text":"And so the question\nreally became how to live."},"378":{"dur":4,"text":"And so what I'd like to do today\nis to share four lessons that I"},"383":{"dur":4,"text":"think are really-- they're very\nuseful in terms of investing,"},"387":{"dur":1,"text":"or at least three of them are."},"389":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think they\nwill help to make"},"391":{"dur":1,"text":"you richer over the long term."},"392":{"dur":1,"text":"But I actually think\nthey're also very"},"393":{"dur":1,"text":"important in terms of life."},"394":{"dur":4,"text":"And really it seems\nto me that the goal"},"399":{"dur":3,"text":"is to reverse engineer\nthese people to figure out,"},"402":{"dur":1,"text":"how do I become richer?"},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"How do I become\nsmarter and wiser?"},"405":{"dur":1,"text":"And how do I become happier?"},"407":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I think these\nare lessons that"},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"help you in each of these areas"},"413":{"dur":3,"text":"And we're going to talk-- I've\ngot these four things up here."},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"Hopefully you can see if\nthe technology is working."},"419":{"dur":1,"text":"The first idea we're\ngoing to discuss"},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"is the willingness to be lonely."},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"And what we're really\ntalking about here"},"425":{"dur":1,"text":"is this idea that\nyou have to take"},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"what Peter Bernstein,\nthe market historian"},"429":{"dur":4,"text":"once described as uncomfortably\nidiosyncratic positions."},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"That if you want\nto outperform, you"},"436":{"dur":1,"text":"have to diverge from the crowd."},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"You have to be\nwilling to be lonely."},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"And this has\npowerful implications"},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"both in terms of investing\nand other areas of life."},"446":{"dur":1,"text":"The second idea we're\ngoing to discuss"},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"is the power of humility,\nwhich as we'll see"},"449":{"dur":1,"text":"is a somewhat\ncontradictory idea."},"451":{"dur":1,"text":"You have to have\nthe self-confidence"},"452":{"dur":4,"text":"to go your own way, but you also\nhave the humility to say yeah,"},"456":{"dur":1,"text":"but what if I'm wrong."},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"And then you have to build\nin safeguards in case"},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"you're wrong."},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"The third idea-- sorry\nfor these gloomy titles."},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"My son Henry said to me,\nman, that's a real downer."},"468":{"dur":4,"text":"The third title is the\nability to take pain."},"472":{"dur":1,"text":"But what we're really\ntalking about here"},"474":{"dur":3,"text":"is emotional resilience, which\nI have come to believe over"},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"many years of covering\ninvesting is really"},"480":{"dur":3,"text":"one of the absolute keys to long\nterm success as an investor."},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"And what we're talking about\nwith all of these people,"},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"we're not talking\nabout being great"},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"as an investor over one cycle."},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"We're trying to achieve\nsuccess over many decades."},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"And so you need this\nability to take pain,"},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"because there are going to\nbe times when you're hit."},"499":{"dur":5,"text":"And this obviously also relates\nto other aspects of life."},"504":{"dur":3,"text":"The fourth topic, which\nis slightly more elevated"},"507":{"dur":4,"text":"in areas, is the key to\nhappiness, which it strikes me"},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"that one of the\nthings you really"},"513":{"dur":4,"text":"want to learn from these\ngreat investors is how do I"},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"not just become rich, but how do\nI make the money work for me so"},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"that it's not just sort of\na short circuit in my life,"},"524":{"dur":3,"text":"but is actually something\nthat enriches my life?"},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"So the fourth section\nis really about what"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"you could call true prosperity."},"532":{"dur":3,"text":"And what we're really talking\nabout with all of these things"},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"is the ability to stack\nthe odds in your favor"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"so that you're kind of\ntilting the playing field so"},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"that the odds of having\na successful life in all"},"543":{"dur":4,"text":"of these different\nareas is increased."},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"So the willingness to be\nlonely-- back in, I'd say,"},"551":{"dur":3,"text":"the winter of 1998, I got\nthis fantastic assignment"},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"to go interview\nSir John Templeton."},"556":{"dur":1,"text":"And as many of you\nknow, Templeton"},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"was one of the greatest\ninvestors of the last century."},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"At the time he was 85 years old."},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"If you had invested in\nthe Templeton growth fund,"},"566":{"dur":4,"text":"over 38 years he compounded\na rate of about 15% a year."},"570":{"dur":4,"text":"And as a result, your $10,000\nwould turn into $2 million."},"574":{"dur":3,"text":"And in fact his returns--\nthat doesn't really"},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"reflect his returns because he\nwas an extraordinary investor"},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"really for about 60 or so years."},"582":{"dur":3,"text":"So he defines this ability\nto have great success"},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"over a long period."},"588":{"dur":4,"text":"Now Templeton lived in\nthis gated community"},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"called Lyford Cay in\nthe Bahamas, which"},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"was a fascinating place."},"596":{"dur":1,"text":"He had decided\nearly in his life he"},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"was going to save-- he\nsaved half of the money"},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"that he made early\nin his career,"},"602":{"dur":1,"text":"and then decided\nwith his wife, we're"},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"going to be able to live\nanywhere we want in the world."},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"And so they took a\nbunch of pieces of paper"},"609":{"dur":1,"text":"and figured out\nthat Lyford Cay was"},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"the place-- Lyford Cay was a\nplace where people like Prince"},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"Rainier of Monaco lived."},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"The Aga Khan had a house there."},"619":{"dur":1,"text":"Sean Connery had a house there."},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"I think part of\n\"Thunderbolt\", the Bond movie"},"622":{"dur":0,"text":"was filmed there."},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"So this was a pretty sweet gig\nto go in the middle of winter,"},"626":{"dur":3,"text":"to go interview Templeton,\nthis great guru at Lyford Cay."},"630":{"dur":3,"text":"And I remember as I came up to\nhis house, there's actually,"},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"as you walked along\nthe porch of his house,"},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"an electronic dog\nstarts barking."},"638":{"dur":1,"text":"And I had this\nquandary whether I"},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"should out him in\nthis article as having"},"641":{"dur":3,"text":"this fake security, which\nof course I did mention"},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"in the article."},"646":{"dur":5,"text":"And so Templeton is\nkind of this giant"},"651":{"dur":1,"text":"of this period,\nthis 85-year-old who"},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"is really the pioneer of\ninternational investing."},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"He was the first great\nfund manager in America"},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"to venture abroad and\nsay, why should I just be"},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"looking for bargains in the US?"},"664":{"dur":2,"text":"So the most\nmemorable experience,"},"667":{"dur":3,"text":"strangely with Templeton,\nwas not in fact anything"},"670":{"dur":0,"text":"that he said."},"671":{"dur":3,"text":"It was watching him one\nmorning when he was exercising."},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"And he didn't actually\nknow that I was there."},"676":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'm on the beach\nin Lyford Cay."},"678":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a very tough assignment."},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"And I hide behind a\npalm tree because I'm"},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"worried that he's going\nto see that I'm there."},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"And he's in the water."},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"He would do this for 45 minutes\nevery day for many years."},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"He's in the water\nup to here, and he's"},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"pumping his arms and\nhis legs like this."},"693":{"dur":3,"text":"And he just looks ridiculous."},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"He's wearing this hat\nwith this crazy visor"},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"sticking up there and\nthese ear flaps down here."},"701":{"dur":3,"text":"And his face is slathered\nwith sun cream, which"},"705":{"dur":1,"text":"he hasn't bothered to rub in."},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"And as I'm watching\nthis, I'm just thinking,"},"709":{"dur":1,"text":"this is kind of this\nextraordinary sight."},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"I thought I was going\nto see this kind"},"712":{"dur":6,"text":"of heroic sort of wise sage."},"719":{"dur":3,"text":"And in fact he just kind\nof looks like an idiot."},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"And when I got home to New\nYork, I'm thinking about this."},"726":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'm thinking actually,\nthis is the key to Templeton."},"729":{"dur":3,"text":"What I realized Templeton really\nembodies is this willingness"},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"to be lonely, this\nwillingness to say,"},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"this is how I do things."},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"This is a way to act that\nactually makes sense to me,"},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"is a really efficient exercise."},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't care what\nanybody thinks of me."},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's an extraordinarily\npowerful way to think."},"747":{"dur":1,"text":"And this became\nkind of a metaphor"},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"for me when I started thinking\nabout the great investors,"},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"that what all of these\nguys have in common is"},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"they're kind of mavericks\nand free thinkers."},"755":{"dur":1,"text":"They don't go with the crowd."},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"If you want to outperform,\nyou have to be different."},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is something that\nall of these guys have."},"763":{"dur":1,"text":"And you see this\nvery vividly with"},"764":{"dur":4,"text":"this extraordinary investment\nthat Templeton made in 1939."},"769":{"dur":3,"text":"So the world is kind of\ncoming to an end, right?"},"773":{"dur":5,"text":"It's really this calamitous\nevent where Germany"},"778":{"dur":4,"text":"is about to overrun Paris."},"783":{"dur":3,"text":"The market is still--\nmany companies"},"786":{"dur":3,"text":"have been just smashed\nby the Great Depression."},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"And Templeton looks at\nthe Wall Street Journal,"},"792":{"dur":1,"text":"and he tells me he\nfigures out that there"},"794":{"dur":2,"text":"are 104 stocks trading\non the New York Stock"},"796":{"dur":3,"text":"Exchange that are all trading\nat less than $1 apiece."},"799":{"dur":4,"text":"And he figures that actually\nthe world is not coming apart."},"803":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not going to\nend in the way-- this"},"805":{"dur":1,"text":"is one of the great\nlines from Howard Marks."},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"Howard Marks said to\nme, most of the time,"},"809":{"dur":1,"text":"the world doesn't end."},"811":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is something that\nTempleton figured out."},"815":{"dur":1,"text":"So he figures\nactually the war is"},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"going to jump start all of these\ntiny companies that are still"},"819":{"dur":2,"text":"recovering from the\nGreat Depression."},"822":{"dur":3,"text":"And so he put in this order\nfor 104 of these stocks."},"825":{"dur":3,"text":"And the broker that he calls,\ncalls him back and says,"},"829":{"dur":2,"text":"yeah, it's an eccentric\norder, but fine."},"831":{"dur":0,"text":"We'll do it."},"832":{"dur":2,"text":"But there are 37 of these\ncompanies that are bankrupt."},"835":{"dur":2,"text":"And Templeton says\nyeah, I want those too."},"838":{"dur":3,"text":"And so he buys these 104 stocks."},"841":{"dur":3,"text":"And he said to me that\nfive years later when"},"844":{"dur":3,"text":"he liquidated his\nposition, 100 out of 104"},"847":{"dur":3,"text":"had been profitable bets,\nand he quintupled his money."},"851":{"dur":2,"text":"So think about this\nin context, right?"},"854":{"dur":3,"text":"This guy was about 27 years old\nat the time that he did this."},"857":{"dur":2,"text":"He'd started on Wall Street\nmaybe two years before."},"859":{"dur":1,"text":"He had no money."},"860":{"dur":1,"text":"He came from nothing."},"861":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, his father told him, I\nthink his second year at Yale,"},"864":{"dur":3,"text":"I cannot pay a dollar towards\nyour education anymore."},"868":{"dur":2,"text":"And here he actually\nborrowed $10,000."},"870":{"dur":2,"text":"It was the only time he ever\nborrowed money to invest,"},"873":{"dur":1,"text":"he told me at least."},"875":{"dur":4,"text":"And so he borrows what in\ntoday's money is about $170,000"},"879":{"dur":0,"text":"I think."},"880":{"dur":3,"text":"This is incredible\nguts to do this."},"883":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is the first\nidea is that you"},"886":{"dur":2,"text":"need to be willing to\ndiverge from the crowd"},"888":{"dur":2,"text":"if you're going to\nsucceed at this."},"891":{"dur":3,"text":"And you have this extraordinary\ndefault option, right?"},"894":{"dur":2,"text":"If you don't want to\ndiverge from the crowd,"},"896":{"dur":1,"text":"you can just buy an index fund."},"898":{"dur":2,"text":"And we

get the money."},"2652":{"dur":1,"text":"And the thing that's\nmore amazing about this"},"2654":{"dur":2,"text":"is that that guy is\nin this room now,"},"2656":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's Ashok, who's

things\nthat was fascinating to me"},"2791":{"dur":1,"text":"in terms of\ninterviewing an array"},"2793":{"dur":1,"text":"of these different\ngreat investors"},"2794":{"dur":3,"text":"was actually to see the\ndifference in the way"},"2797":{"dur":2,"text":"that they had solved\nthis question."},"2800":{"dur":3,"text":"So Mohnish for example\nhad most of his money"},"2803":{"dur":3,"text":"in about five stocks and\nhad tremendous confidence,"},"2807":{"dur":2,"text":"tremendous knowledge\nof these stocks."},"2809":{"dur":1,"text":"But then one of them blew up."},"2812":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's

that."},"2821":{"dur":1,"text":"And so you for\nMohnish, because he"},"2823":{"dur":5,"text":"has this extraordinary\ntemperament, it's feasible."},"2828":{"dur":3,"text":"So I said to Mohnish about\nthe financial crisis, I said,"},"2831":{"dur":2,"text":"how did you deal with the\nstress of the financial crisis?"},"2834":{"dur":1,"text":"Because at one point\nhis fund, his hedge fund"},"2836":{"dur":1,"text":"was massively down."},"2837":{"dur":2,"text":"And he said oh, I\ndon't feel stress."},"2840":{"dur":3,"text":"And I actually don't\nthink that's true."},"2843":{"dur":1,"text":"I think it may have\nbeen true then,"},"2844":{"dur":1,"text":"but I think there\nare circumstances"},"2845":{"dur":2,"text":"where even for Mohnish or even\nfor Bill

that actually\nit becomes very painful."},"2855":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I think even for\npeople like Mohnish who"},"2858":{"dur":2,"text":"have an extraordinary\ntemperament,"},"2861":{"dur":3,"text":"you have to be aware of the\ndangers of overconfidence."},"2867":{"dur":5,"text":"And I talked to people like\nJoel Greenblatt about this."},"2872":{"dur":3,"text":"And Joel had 80%-- Joel is\none of the greatest hedge fund"},"2876":{"dur":0,"text":"managers of all time."},"2877":{"dur":2,"text":"And Joel had 80%\nof his money in six"},"2880":{"dur":2,"text":"to eight stocks for\nmuch of his career."},"2882":{"dur":4,"text":"And he said, every few weeks\nthe portfolio might go down"},"2886":{"dur":1,"text":"30% in a couple of weeks."},"2888":{"dur":1,"text":"And he said it was fine for him."},"2890":{"dur":0,"text":"He could cope with it."},"2891":{"dur":2,"text":"But he said he actually returned\na lot of the

money."},"2897":{"dur":2,"text":"So the only shareholders\nwere him and his family"},"2900":{"dur":1,"text":"and his partners."},"2901":{"dur":2,"text":"And he said if the family lost\nmoney or friends lost money,"},"2904":{"dur":1,"text":"he would just help them out."},"2906":{"dur":1,"text":"And so it was OK."},"2907":{"dur":5,"text":"So I think the point\nis, you kind of have"},"2913":{"dur":4,"text":"to look at your own temperament\nand say how unemotional am I."},"2917":{"dur":2,"text":"And one of the things my friend\nGuy Spier was saying to me"},"2920":{"dur":2,"text":"recently is you can\nactually get to a point"},"2922":{"dur":3,"text":"where you are emotionally\nflooded, where you can actually"},"2926":{"dur":2,"text":"reach a point where, if a\nsufficient number of things"},"2928":{"dur":1,"text":"can go wrong at the\nsame time, that it's"},"2930":{"dur":3,"text":"very hard to be rational,\nto make rational

antifragile."},"2948":{"dur":3,"text":"So he'll survive\nwhatever goes wrong."},"2952":{"dur":1,"text":"And so Guy's view is,\nyou want to kind of look"},"2953":{"dur":6,"text":"at what everyone else is doing,\nwhat the people you really"},"2960":{"dur":1,"text":"admire, where they\nare on the risk curve."},"2962":{"dur":2,"text":"And then he said, just\ndo less than them."},"2964":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think it's a really\ninteresting idea that"},"2969":{"dur":1,"text":"yeah, if you're\nsuper constrained,"},"2971":{"dur":2,"text":"if you're incredibly smart,

40,"},"2980":{"dur":5,"text":"50 years as an investor, I\nthink diversification and just"},"2986":{"dur":1,"text":"saying, what do I know."},"2987":{"dur":0,"text":"What if it goes

very\nbrilliant analyst."},"3065":{"dur":2,"text":"He's got a very brilliant mind."},"3067":{"dur":4,"text":"I think as with all of\nthese great investors,"},"3071":{"dur":1,"text":"they're flawed."},"3073":{"dur":2,"text":"They're not perfect."},"3075":{"dur":2,"text":"They make mistakes."},"3077":{"dur":3,"text":"And his mistake with\nValeant-- so far"},"3081":{"dur":3,"text":"it's

he's always been taking\nthese very contrary positions"},"3093":{"dur":1,"text":"that are very aggressive."},"3094":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's part of his character."},"3096":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think Bill has a very\ninteresting personality."},"3101":{"dur":2,"text":"He's very combative\nin certain ways."},"3103":{"dur":5,"text":"And he's prepared to go into\nthese very difficult

a\nvery distinctive approach."},"3127":{"dur":2,"text":"And one of the things he\nsaid to me about money,"},"3129":{"dur":3,"text":"he said the reason I wanted\nto get rich from very early on"},"3132":{"dur":1,"text":"was so that I would\nhave independence."},"3134":{"dur":2,"text":"He said it was so that I\ncould say what I believe,"},"3136":{"dur":3,"text":"so that I could act in a\nway that I believe is right."},"3139":{"dur":3,"text":"And so he really embodies\nthis idea of the willingness"},"3143":{"dur":2,"text":"to be lonely, the willingness\nto take idiosyncratic positions."},"3146":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's going to mean\nthere are times where he's"},"3148":{"dur":1,"text":"going to look really stupid."},"3149":{"dur":3,"text":"But there were\ntimes where Buffett"},"3152":{"dur":1,"text":"looked stupid in\nthe late '90s where"},"3154":{"dur":1,"text":"he refused to buy\nany tech stocks,"},"3156":{"dur":2,"text":"where Eveillard looked stupid,\nwhere

Jean-Marie,"},"3174":{"dur":1,"text":"he's half senile anyway."},"3176":{"dur":3,"text":"And Jean-Marie said\nto me, I was 59."},"3179":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I think one of the things\nthat's really striking to me"},"3183":{"dur":2,"text":"is that there are always periods\nwhere these great investors"},"3185":{"dur":2,"text":"look like idiots."},"3188":{"dur":4,"text":"And my money is on\nAckman, just in terms"},"3193":{"dur":3,"text":"of his intellect, his\nanalytical brilliance,"},"3196":{"dur":4,"text":"and he's got a kind of in\ninner toughness to him."},"3200":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think the real\nlesson for-- you know,"},"3204":{"dur":2,"text":"there are multiple lessons\nof the Valeant situation."},"3206":{"dur":2,"text":"But I think the hubris\nand the overconfidence one"},"3209":{"dur":2,"text":"is important, the\nunknowability of the future."},"3212":{"dur":1,"text":"Peter Lynch was looking\nthrough some old notes"},"3214":{"dur":2,"text":"from an interview I

it had the cover\nof Vogue three times."},"3241":{"dur":2,"text":"And their earnings, it\nwas like a record year."},"3244":{"dur":3,"text":"And he said then the\nmovie, what was it,"},"3247":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Bonnie and Clyde\" comes out."},"3248":{"dur":1,"text":"And he says Faye\nDunaway is wearing"},"3250":{"dur":3,"text":"these incredible long\npleated 1930s skirts."},"3253":{"dur":2,"text":"And it totally and\nutterly changes fashion."},"3256":{"dur":2,"text":"And he said in the\nsame year this company"},"3258":{"dur":2,"text":"had record earnings, the\ncompany went bankrupt."},"3261":{"dur":4,"text":"And he said he talked\nto Ned Johnson about it,"},"3265":{"dur":1,"text":"and he said Ned\nJohnson just laughed."},"3266":{"dur":1,"text":"And he said yeah,\nsometimes this stuff just"},"3268":{"dur":1,"text":"comes out of left field."},"3269":{"dur":5,"text":"And so I think this sort of\nhealthy awareness of the

something,"},"3308":{"dur":2,"text":"but then it eventually\nbuilds up on them."},"3310":{"dur":5,"text":"So say Bill Miller, Valeant\nexample that you gave."},"3316":{"dur":2,"text":"In those
