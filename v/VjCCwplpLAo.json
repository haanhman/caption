{"0":{"dur":1,"text":"[MUSIC PLAYING]"},"10":{"dur":3,"text":"I got to build the Chrome\nDev Summit website last year"},"13":{"dur":3,"text":"and it was amazing, but like\nany project of this sort,"},"16":{"dur":1,"text":"it has loads of challenges."},"18":{"dur":1,"text":"So material design\nis really good"},"20":{"dur":3,"text":"for apps but sites are a\nbit more of a challenge"},"23":{"dur":2,"text":"because it doesn't have\nmuch to say about those."},"25":{"dur":2,"text":"I had to step in, kind of\nlook at the spec, and go"},"28":{"dur":1,"text":"[INAUDIBLE], how does\nthis work for a site?"},"30":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'm looking at the\nspirit of the thing,"},"31":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm looking at the\ndetails, trying"},"33":{"dur":1,"text":"to figure out from\nall the other material"},"35":{"dur":1,"text":"design things I've seen,\nhow to actually make"},"37":{"dur":1,"text":"it work for a site."},"38":{"dur":1,"text":"And in the end, I\nfeel like I got there."},"40":{"dur":2,"text":"I feel like it does look\nlike a material design site."},"42":{"dur":2,"text":"But at the same time,\nthere's a bunch in there"},"45":{"dur":1,"text":"that probably isn't in the spec."},"47":{"dur":1,"text":"When I got to\nbuilding the site, I"},"48":{"dur":2,"text":"knew that the animations\nof these card takeovers"},"51":{"dur":2,"text":"were going to be really hard\nto do at 60 frames a second."},"54":{"dur":2,"text":"So I ended up coming up\nwith a new way of doing it."},"56":{"dur":2,"text":"And that way was to take the\nfirst position of the card"},"59":{"dur":2,"text":"and the last\nposition of the card"},"61":{"dur":2,"text":"and then using transform\nand opacity changes"},"63":{"dur":2,"text":"to reverse the end\nposition back to the start."},"66":{"dur":2,"text":"Sounds a bit bizarre."},"68":{"dur":2,"text":"But then when you switch\non transitions on transform"},"70":{"dur":2,"text":"and opacity and you\nlet it play forward,"},"73":{"dur":2,"text":"it plays cheaply because\nthese are just done by the GPU"},"76":{"dur":1,"text":"and so on."},"77":{"dur":3,"text":"I call it FLIP because it's\nfirst, last, invert, play."},"80":{"dur":1,"text":"And it was the way\nthat we got from hey,"},"82":{"dur":2,"text":"this is not going to run at\n60 frames a second to yes,"},"85":{"dur":3,"text":"this pretty much does run at 60\nframes a second and that for me"},"88":{"dur":2,"text":"was really satisfying."},"90":{"dur":1,"text":"Around the office,\nwe would often"},"92":{"dur":1,"text":"talk about the site\nand the new things that"},"94":{"dur":1,"text":"were coming into the\nplatform that we thought,"},"96":{"dur":3,"text":"hey we could throw these on and\nthey would really add a lot."},"99":{"dur":2,"text":"The first one that I\nwanted to add on for"},"101":{"dur":2,"text":"was service worker because\nI knew conference Wi-Fi is"},"104":{"dur":1,"text":"normally pretty weak."},"106":{"dur":1,"text":"It's slightly better\nat Chrome Dev Summit"},"108":{"dur":2,"text":"than anywhere else I've\nbeen but all the same."},"110":{"dur":1,"text":"Service worker there\nfor offline and this"},"112":{"dur":2,"text":"was before any of the new\nstuff, like push notifications."},"114":{"dur":0,"text":"That was great."},"115":{"dur":2,"text":"So that went on."},"117":{"dur":3,"text":"We added on theme color\nbecause that was really nice"},"121":{"dur":0,"text":"on Chrome and Android."},"122":{"dur":1,"text":"Again, as you\nchange the section,"},"123":{"dur":1,"text":"just the theme color changes."},"124":{"dur":1,"text":"That was really great."},"126":{"dur":3,"text":"And then the last thing\nwas to add a manifest file,"},"129":{"dur":2,"text":"so that you could save\nthis thing to home screen."},"132":{"dur":2,"text":"It would always launch\nin portrait mode."},"135":{"dur":2,"text":"And those three things\ncombined, actually"},"137":{"dur":1,"text":"made it feel really\nintegrated to the platform."},"139":{"dur":3,"text":"The all new and ready sort\nof a great opportunity"},"142":{"dur":1,"text":"to showcase those technologies."},"144":{"dur":3,"text":"I love sharing the process that\nI go through with developers."},"148":{"dur":2,"text":"So for me, it was never about\nbuild something and then"},"151":{"dur":2,"text":"It's always about build\nsomething, get the source code"},"154":{"dur":2,"text":"out there so that\nothers could look at it"},"156":{"dur":3,"text":"and figure out how you actually\nsolved particular problems."},"160":{"dur":2,"text":"But in my case, I was also\nable to stand up at Chrome Dev"},"162":{"dur":3,"text":"Summit itself and say, the\nsite that you've all been using"},"166":{"dur":2,"text":"is available now and\nhere's the process"},"168":{"dur":1,"text":"but I went through to get there."},"170":{"dur":2,"text":"Here's the journey\nthat I went on."},"172":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, all in, it's like\nthis package of technologies"},"176":{"dur":4,"text":"and ideas and source code\nand just sort of hopefully"},"180":{"dur":1,"text":"an inspiring thing\nthat lets people"},"182":{"dur":1,"text":"go, you know what,\nactually, I didn't think"},"184":{"dur":2,"text":"about the web like\nthat and now that I am,"},"186":{"dur":2,"text":"I can see the possibilities."}}
