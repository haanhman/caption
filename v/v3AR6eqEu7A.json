looked at our\nempty living room walls."},"255":{"dur":3,"text":"And you have to remember this\nwas in a time before IKEA."},"259":{"dur":2,"text":"So there was nowhere to go to\nbuy reasonably priced

good\nthere, which is a shame."},"276":{"dur":4,"text":"So we started hunting them,\nand their numbers plummeted."},"280":{"dur":3,"text":"So then if you fast\nforward to the year 1999,"},"284":{"dur":3,"text":"there was only one\nleft, one bucardo."},"287":{"dur":4,"text":"And that was an elderly\nadult female called Celia."},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"And scientists knew

OK?"},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"So they did the same\nkind of experiment."},"458":{"dur":5,"text":"And then in 2003, after hundreds\nand hundreds of attempts,"},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"something incredible happened."},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is the actual\nmoment when it happened."},"469":{"dur":3,"text":"So they created a\nlittle baby bucardo,"},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"Celia's identical clone."},"475":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is the moment that\nthe extinction actually first"},"480":{"dur":0,"text":"happened."},"481":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is actually\nover 10 years ago,"},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"which most people don't realize."},"484":{"dur":4,"text":"So it was a phenomenal\nachievement, phenomenal."},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"And she was beautiful,\nthis little

unfortunately, she\ndeveloped breathing problems"},"501":{"dur":4,"text":"and then she died just a couple\nof minutes after she was born."},"505":{"dur":4,"text":"So the bucardo isn't\njust the first

that with time"},"526":{"dur":3,"text":"and with funding-- those are the\ntwo limiting factors-- they are"},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"completely convinced\nthey will be"},"531":{"dur":4,"text":"able to

sea,"},"578":{"dur":3,"text":"pterosaurs in the sky,\nand dinosaurs on the land."},"582":{"dur":3,"text":"And it made me dream about\nbringing back a dinosaur."},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"So when you think\nabout de-extinction,"},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"you think about what\nmight be possible."},"589":{"dur":3,"text":"And I begin to wonder, could\nyou bring back a dinosaur?"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you did bring back\na dinosaur, to my mind,"},"596":{"dur":4,"text":"there's only one contender,\nand it's this, T-rex."},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"It has to be a T-rex, right?"},"602":{"dur":4,"text":"Once described as the absolute\nwarlord of the jungle."},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"Its teeth have, in the\nscientific literature,"},"609":{"dur":4,"text":"quite humorously been\ndescribed as lethal bananas."},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"So if ever there's two words\nthat don't go together,"},"616":{"dur":4,"text":"I think it's lethal and banana\nor possibly Trump

interested."},"626":{"dur":1,"text":"Can you bring a dinosaur back?"},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"So I spoke to the\nscientists, and they tell me"},"630":{"dur":6,"text":"it boils down to one raw magic\ningredient, which is this, DNA."},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"And here is some that\nI knitted earlier."},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"So DNA is a very beautiful\nmolecule, but it's very flimsy."},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"It's very fragile."},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"And after we die, it\nbegins to break down."},"647":{"dur":1,"text":"And in exceptional\ncircumstances,"},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"it can be preserved\nfor a long time."},"651":{"dur":3,"text":"But the oldest thing we have\nevery extracted DNA from,"},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"meaningful amounts of DNA from,\nis less than a million years"},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"old."},"659":{"dur":3,"text":"So dinosaurs died out\n65 million years ago."},"662":{"dur":3,"text":"So no DNA, no dinosaurs, sorry."},"666":{"dur":1,"text":"So we're not going\nto see a dinosaur."},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"The closest thing we will\never get to a

dodos?"},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"And I have to say, these\nbeautiful illustrations which"},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"are in the book are the work\nof a guy called Matt Dawson."},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"He is fantastic."},"693":{"dur":0,"text":"And so this is his dodo."},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"Could you bring a dodo back?"},"695":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, they died\nmuch more recently,"},"697":{"dur":3,"text":"so in theory, it might\nbe a bit more possible."},"700":{"dur":4,"text":"However, where they lived\nin Mauritius was very hot."},"705":{"dur":3,"text":"And the soil where they fell\nwhen they died was very acidic."},"708":{"dur":1,"text":"So their DNA is not preserved."},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"So no DNA, no dodos."},"713":{"dur":1,"text":"Sorry about that."},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"But it got this idea\ngoing in my head"},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"when I was thinking about\nthe book, and I thought,"},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"so you can't do dinosaurs\nand you can't do dodos."},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"You need something from\nmuch more recent history."},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"How far could you\ntake this technology?"},"727":{"dur":1,"text":"Where could you go with it?"},"728":{"dur":5,"text":"And I began wondering about\nthis man, Elvis Presley,"},"734":{"dur":4,"text":"a man deemed so sexy by\nthe TV

you--"},"746":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't think it's a good idea."},"747":{"dur":1,"text":"I am not saying that\nwe should do this."},"749":{"dur":3,"text":"But as a thought experiment,\nwith the

maybe"},"822":{"dur":1,"text":"a bit odd, but hey."},"824":{"dur":2,"text":"And her finger\nsnagged on something."},"826":{"dur":1,"text":"And she picked it\nup, thinking it"},"828":{"dur":1,"text":"was like a wayward\nsequin or something."},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was dark, so she\npopped it in her pocket."},"832":{"dur":3,"text":"And when she got outside,

to,"},"853":{"dur":1,"text":"so we scratched\nthat off the list."},"854":{"dur":1,"text":"But they have another\nsource of DNA."},"856":{"dur":6,"text":"And this is Joni Mabe's prized\npossession in
