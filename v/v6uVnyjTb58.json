become\napparent that I had"},"277":{"dur":2,"text":"neglected to install a\nbraking mechanism."},"279":{"dur":3,"text":"So I grabbed a brick and I\nshoved it against the

was not very fast."},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm pretty sure it\nwas not safe."},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"And it got stranded in the halls\nof my high school and so"},"340":{"dur":2,"text":"forth, but not before I got a\nphoto op with the local paper."},"346":{"dur":3,"text":"And after that, I went to\nengineering school."},"349":{"dur":3,"text":"And I worked in green tech in\nEurope for several

reason."},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"But regardless, these\ntrees were great."},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"Because they blocked\nthe summer sun."},"411":{"dur":1,"text":"And in the winter, the leaves\nwould

solar\ntechnology is eons old."},"418":{"dur":5,"text":"So as a result, the annual\nutility bills for this house"},"423":{"dur":2,"text":"were thousands of dollars less\nthan a house that was just"},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"down the street that\nwas brand new."},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"And these trees had been\ndoing this every"},"431":{"dur":3,"text":"year, for 100 years."},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"And as a green architect,\nmy first job was"},"437":{"dur":3,"text":"to chop them down."},"440":{"dur":3,"text":"And the solar cells demanded it,\nas this man pointed out."},"444":{"dur":4,"text":"You can't put solar cells on\nthe roof of a shaded house."},"448":{"dur":4,"text":"And I would soon find out that\nthis was first of many demands"},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"that the solar cells\nwould make."},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"And demand number two, was\nfor lots of money."},"455":{"dur":3,"text":"And if you read anything about\nsolar cells these days, you'll"},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"likely be left with the\nimpression that solar cell"},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"costs are dropping and\nthe price curve looks"},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"something like this."},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"But over the past decade, the\ninstalled cost of solar cells"},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"actually looked like this."},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"So why is there such\na discrepancy?"},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, part of the reason has\nto do with subsidies."},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"Subsidies give the illusion of a\nprice drop, when really just"},"483":{"dur":1,"text":"someone else is paying for it."},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"But there's a little bit more\nto the story than that."},"488":{"dur":3,"text":"Journalists, for instance,\npoint to the price of"},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"polysilicon and the technical\ncomponents of solar cells."},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"And indeed, those costs\nare dropping."},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"But polysilicon for instance,\nrepresents just a fifth of the"},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"cost of an installed\nsolar

installation."},"510":{"dur":3,"text":"You'd still have to pay for\nall of those, even if the"},"513":{"dur":4,"text":"price of polysilicon were\nto drop to zero."},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"And so those things get pretty\nexpensive, especially when you"},"519":{"dur":3,"text":"start getting into things like\nthe rare earth metals and"},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"heavy metals, which incidentally\nbrings us to our"},"525":{"dur":4,"text":"next demand of solar cells, is\nthat they require some pretty"},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"toxic stuff."},"531":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, solar cell manufacturing\ninvolves the use or release of"},"535":{"dur":4,"text":"numerous compounds explosive,\ncompounds and toxic, compounds"},"539":{"dur":3,"text":"like the cell here, which\ncontains cadmium, like most"},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"thin-film technologies, which\nthe EPA recognize as a toxin."},"546":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, what happens with this\nat the end of its life?"},"551":{"dur":3,"text":"If we

with"},"637":{"dur":4,"text":"pollution, hail, snow, ice,\nthese sorts of factors."},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"And the third was heat."},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"So right in the middle of the\nday when the

board."},"653":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, in addition\nto all of these"},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"effects, solar cells age."},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"And their output fades\nby about 1% a
