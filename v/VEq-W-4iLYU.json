speaker."},"28":{"dur":6,"text":"You know, for nearly half a century, CES has\nbeen mostly about cutting-edge consumer products"},"35":{"dur":4,"text":"and during most of its more\nthan 100-year history,"},"39":{"dur":5,"text":"IBM has been the preeminent leader\nin the business to business IT."},"45":{"dur":2,"text":"But that's changing for both of us,"},"48":{"dur":3,"text":"and I am thrilled that we have\nIBM's CEO Ginni Rometty here"},"51":{"dur":3,"text":"with us today to talk about this new paradigm."},"56":{"dur":5,"text":"In fact, the massive convergence going on around\nthe world, thanks to Big Data and the Internet"},"61":{"dur":3,"text":"of Things, is driving two distinct trends."},"65":{"dur":4,"text":"First, CES is no longer totally\nconsumer product centric."},"71":{"dur":4,"text":"It's increasingly about technologies\ndriven by the Internet of Things;"},"76":{"dur":5,"text":"and IBM is today leveraging its advantages\nwith data and the Internet of Things"},"81":{"dur":2,"text":"to enter spaces it has never\neven been in before,"},"84":{"dur":3,"text":"appealing to totally new audiences as a result."},"88":{"dur":5,"text":"As Ginni has said many times, data\nis humankind's next natural resource,"},"93":{"dur":5,"text":"and she's leading a major transformation at\nbig blue to become \"the\" preeminent company"},"99":{"dur":5,"text":"in what it calls the new cognitive era,\ndriven by systems that actually learn."},"106":{"dur":3,"text":"During her tenure -- which began almost\nfour years ago to this very day --"},"110":{"dur":2,"text":"she has made the cognitive power of one"},"112":{"dur":5,"text":"of IBM's most iconic technologies the\ncenterpiece of that transformation: Watson."},"119":{"dur":4,"text":"The same system, which beat the two\ntop human contestants on Jeopardy!"},"123":{"dur":5,"text":"in 2011 has been featured in ads with\nsuch top icons as Bob Dylan, in fact,"},"128":{"dur":4,"text":"it's now at the center of what may\nbe big blue's biggest bet ever."},"133":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, the same company's\ntechnology helped land man"},"136":{"dur":6,"text":"on the moon just a generation ago has\nits own new moon shot today with Watson:"},"143":{"dur":2,"text":"transforming healthcare and\neducation as we know it."},"146":{"dur":1,"text":"And they're not stopping there."},"148":{"dur":4,"text":"In fact, last May, Ginni made\nheadlines with a really bold prediction."},"153":{"dur":4,"text":"She told an audience of IBM customers in\nNew York that included engineers, doctors,"},"158":{"dur":4,"text":"bankers and other professionals\nthat, quote, in the future,"},"162":{"dur":5,"text":"every decision that mankind makes is going to\nbe informed by a cognitive system like Watson,"},"168":{"dur":1,"text":"and our lives will be better for it."},"171":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, with the coming cognitive era,"},"173":{"dur":3,"text":"I am thrilled to announce an\nimportant research partnership"},"177":{"dur":3,"text":"between the Consumer Technology\nAssociation Foundation and IBM."},"182":{"dur":5,"text":"The research will focus on identifying how\ncognitive computing will transform our lives"},"188":{"dur":6,"text":"as we age and also transform the lives\nof those living with disabilities."},"194":{"dur":4,"text":"IBM's generous contribution of funding and\nresources will lead to important research"},"199":{"dur":3,"text":"into the impact of technologies like Watson."},"204":{"dur":1,"text":"It's still the early days,"},"205":{"dur":4,"text":"and major transformations are\nextremely difficult to pull off."},"210":{"dur":5,"text":"But as Ginni is fond of saying, there's\na reason why IBM is 105 years old."},"216":{"dur":3,"text":"It's because the company has a\nlong history of making big bets"},"219":{"dur":2,"text":"in the future and of being proven right."},"221":{"dur":6,"text":"We will hear from Ginni about IBM's bold and\noptimistic vision for the coming new era powered"},"227":{"dur":1,"text":"by Watson and cognitive business."},"230":{"dur":4,"text":"We'll also see a few demonstrations\nof how it's being used today and hear"},"234":{"dur":4,"text":"from some IBM customers discussing\ncognitive, IoT and other key topics."},"240":{"dur":3,"text":"Ladies and gentlemen, please join\nme in welcoming our keynote speaker,"},"244":{"dur":3,"text":"IBM's CEO, Chairman, Ginni Rometty."},"248":{"dur":11,"text":"[ MUSIC, APPLAUSE ]"},"260":{"dur":1,"text":"You did a great job."},"262":{"dur":0,"text":"Well, thank you."},"263":{"dur":4,"text":"That was a very generous introduction, and I\nthought Gary was going to give my presentation."},"267":{"dur":1,"text":"I thought he was doing a great job, actually."},"269":{"dur":2,"text":"He did a great job except for one thing."},"271":{"dur":3,"text":"Did I hear him properly say\nthat I was with IBM 40 years?"},"275":{"dur":0,"text":"Did I hear that?"},"276":{"dur":1,"text":"That...look at me."},"277":{"dur":1,"text":"Does that sound true?"},"278":{"dur":0,"text":"I hope not."},"279":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're thinking yes, no."},"282":{"dur":5,"text":"And so, look, it is great to see so many\npeople here and so many IBM clients."},"289":{"dur":4,"text":"And I don't think Gary mentioned\nthis: I am the first IBM CEO"},"294":{"dur":2,"text":"to ever speak at a keynote here at CES."},"296":{"dur":1,"text":"And so, you might be asking..."},"298":{"dur":5,"text":"[ CHEERS, APPLAUSE ]"},"304":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, if you clap at that,\nyou will clap at anything."},"305":{"dur":0,"text":"Okay?"},"306":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I am the first, and you\nmight be asking why and why now."},"310":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, I have walked around, looked around,\nclearly, IoT is a major theme here."},"315":{"dur":1,"text":"It impacts every industry, every company."},"318":{"dur":3,"text":"And I am here, IBM is here, because\nI want to assert something to you:"},"322":{"dur":4,"text":"that the future of the Internet of\nThings is cognitive, the cognitive IoT."},"327":{"dur":8,"text":"And I am going to be joined by CEOs from three\nmajor companies, all different industries,"},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"and we're going to make some\nmajor announcements here today"},"338":{"dur":3,"text":"that embody this exact future\nI'm going to talk about."},"342":{"dur":4,"text":"So, let me frame what you're going to\nthen see come to life through their eyes."},"347":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I want to talk about\ncognitive; what is a cognitive IoT?"},"352":{"dur":4,"text":"And then really quickly, what I think\nare three critical success factors"},"356":{"dur":1,"text":"because it's what so many of you are doing."},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"But first I want to start with a question."},"361":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, there's no doubt that the Internet\nof Things is all part of the phenomena"},"365":{"dur":2,"text":"of digitization of products,\nof services, of companies."},"369":{"dur":5,"text":"So, if I ask you to raise your hands and ask how\nmany of you either work for a digital company"},"375":{"dur":5,"text":"or you are trying to become a digital\ncompany, just raise your hand."},"380":{"dur":0,"text":"Okay."},"381":{"dur":4,"text":"Same response about anywhere in the\nworld is almost everyone's hand goes up."},"386":{"dur":4,"text":"So, it doesn't matter if you're B to B, B\nto C, public\/private, it doesn't matter."},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"And this has got a lot to\ndo, as we reinvent ourselves,"},"396":{"dur":3,"text":"what we've done to build a\ngood number of capabilities"},"399":{"dur":2,"text":"to help you become a digital company."},"402":{"dur":5,"text":"It started with building the leading and the\nlargest set of big data and analytics capability"},"408":{"dur":6,"text":"in the world, building a cloud platform for\nthe enterprise that goes between public,"},"415":{"dur":6,"text":"private and hybrid; and then, our work to\nhelp you re-imagine how work is done itself"},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's been through the\npartnership with Apple;"},"424":{"dur":4,"text":"and then having built the world's\nlargest private security company."},"428":{"dur":5,"text":"I think many people don't realize that even by\nthe end of 2014, those businesses for IBM were"},"434":{"dur":4,"text":"over $25 billion; and through the third\nquarter of this year, they've grown 30 percent."},"440":{"dur":6,"text":"So, this idea that analytics, cloud,\nmobility, security, they are all important."},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"But I want to ask you a question."},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"When everybody becomes digital, then what?"},"454":{"dur":0,"text":"Who wins?"},"456":{"dur":3,"text":"I like to say digital is not a\ndestination; it's a foundation."},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, I just looked around\nthis whole conference --"},"463":{"dur":3,"text":"wearables, sensors, cars, data everywhere."},"468":{"dur":5,"text":"But what will differentiate you is\nunderstanding that data, and that brings me"},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"to my first point that Gary also introduced."},"476":{"dur":6,"text":"I believe the most disruptive, transformative\ntrend is now in front of us, and it's cognitive."},"484":{"dur":5,"text":"This ability to think, to learn, to understand\nthe systems, the products, the processes,"},"489":{"dur":5,"text":"everything you do, and it is the\ndawn of a new era, the cognitive era."},"494":{"dur":4,"text":"Maybe you could simply say digital\nbusiness plus digital intelligence."},"500":{"dur":4,"text":"And cognitive is an era of business,\nand it is an era of technology."},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"So, there's two drivers for\nthe technology era: one,"},"510":{"dur":3,"text":"data that was invisible will\nnow be visible to you."},"515":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, you know, we've talked about the phenomena\nof big data forever, but 80 percent of the data"},"521":{"dur":4,"text":"out there, while it may be stored\nin some systems, it's black."},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"It's invisible, it's not understood."},"529":{"dur":4,"text":"Sight, sound, music -- you know, you don't\nactually know inside of it what it is,"},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's what's changing in this new era."},"538":{"dur":3,"text":"The second thing is the advent\nof cognitive computing."},"541":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, some people want to shorthand that to\nartificial intelligence; that's part of it,"},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"but you have to be able to\nwork in natural language"},"549":{"dur":3,"text":"and in a domain: understand\nmedicine, metallurgy."},"554":{"dur":4,"text":"And then more than anything, this is\nan era of systems you do not program;"},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"they understand, they reason and they learn."},"563":{"dur":4,"text":"In fact, they therefore have\nhypotheses and confidence levels --"},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"and this is what IBM Watson does."},"571":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, we worked on this, it started a decade\nago, and we went ahead and debuted Watson"},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"to Jeopardy!, the game show, in 2011."},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"It has come a long way since then."},"583":{"dur":4,"text":"At that time, what Watson could do was question\nand answer, which he did beat everyone then."},"588":{"dur":3,"text":"Question and answer, and he had\nfive technologies underneath it."},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"Fast forward to today."},"594":{"dur":4,"text":"There are now 32 different functions\nhe does, 50 different technologies"},"599":{"dur":5,"text":"under it all available via an API so you\ncan pull them into a business and a process."},"606":{"dur":5,"text":"And we're expanding Watson's senses,\ngiving it things like sight; and in fact,"},"611":{"dur":3,"text":"the first way he's learning sight\nis on reading medical images."},"615":{"dur":7,"text":"And then we made a strategic decision to open up\nWatson as a cloud platform, a whole set of APIs"},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"so you would build businesses,\ncompanies, processes,"},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"products, pulling cognitive into them."},"630":{"dur":5,"text":"So, today Watson's in 36 countries, 80,000\nprogrammers, 500 people building businesses."},"635":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's healthcare, retail, education, travel."},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"And it is a profound new capability."},"643":{"dur":4,"text":"Just think of the ability to build\nthinking into anything that you do."},"648":{"dur":6,"text":"I believe it will change not only what you make,\nit will change how you operate; and in fact,"},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"it will actually change who you are."},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"So, let me then to my second point."},"658":{"dur":0,"text":"That's cognitive."},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"What about the cognitive IoT?"},"663":{"dur":5,"text":"So, imagine, take cognition\nand infuse it into an IoT."},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"And remember, remember this point."},"671":{"dur":4,"text":"The challenge isn't capturing and storing all\nthe data I have seen out in all these hallways."},"677":{"dur":1,"text":"Eighty percent of that data is dark."},"679":{"dur":5,"text":"Nine billion connected devices,\n2.5 katrillion bytes of data a day."},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"The challenge is understanding it."},"687":{"dur":4,"text":"So, let me give you a couple examples\nof clients and what they've accomplished"},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"so far, from the tiny to the large."},"695":{"dur":3,"text":"So, start with a little startup\ncalled Cognitoys."},"699":{"dur":6,"text":"They make a dinosaur to talk to your child,\nand it adapts the personality to work"},"705":{"dur":3,"text":"with your child: what jokes,\nwhat books, how they learn."},"709":{"dur":1,"text":"It adapts to your child's personality."},"711":{"dur":0,"text":"That's a learning system."},"713":{"dur":3,"text":"On the other end of the spectrum,\nAirbus makes aircraft."},"717":{"dur":3,"text":"You won't be surprised that there's\nsix million sensors in an airplane"},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"and that they're from 3,000 suppliers."},"724":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, cognitive IoT, we're about to\nstart processing a half a billion bytes"},"730":{"dur":5,"text":"from every flight taken so that we\ncan predict wear and tear over time,"},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"predict the time to failure,\nmaintenance far in advance."},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, actually over time\nimprove the way parts are made."},"743":{"dur":4,"text":"They're also now working on the\ncognitive cockpit, natural language,"},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"the pilot to interface particularly\nin times of crisis."},"752":{"dur":4,"text":"Then I jump to a different consumer\napplication with a partner called [Finn Air]."},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm originally from Detroit."},"759":{"dur":5,"text":"Detroit Pistons, Auburn Hills, the big, the\nPalace where they play, that's basketball,"},"765":{"dur":6,"text":"100 beacons, Watson is real time\nanalyzing the sentiment of the fans,"},"772":{"dur":5,"text":"matching that with what's happening on the floor\nin the game, real time offers actually related"},"777":{"dur":3,"text":"to what just happened to any player\ngoing to any individual, custom."},"782":{"dur":4,"text":"Another way, you could imagine you would\nengage and do this with any kind of place"},"786":{"dur":1,"text":"where consumers aggregate together."},"789":{"dur":1,"text":"Or, Whirlpool."},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact, if you went to the\nbriefing center here, you'd see it."},"794":{"dur":6,"text":"Real-time appli-- ...real-time devices,\nobviously, what Whirlpool makes, data connected,"},"801":{"dur":3,"text":"the connected appliance, plus Watson IoT cloud"},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"and you have a cognitive\noven, stove, whatever it is."},"809":{"dur":4,"text":"So, if you go down there, you'll see\na Jenn-Air connected to Chef Watson,"},"814":{"dur":2,"text":"and you'll see how they work\ntogether, learning the preferences,"},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"the needs of a family and\nmaking recommendations."},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"That's the world I see in front of us."},"823":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, what do you need to do that?"},"824":{"dur":3,"text":"I will end with three critical success factors."},"828":{"dur":1,"text":"You need the right platform."},"830":{"dur":4,"text":"You're going to need new forms of data -- not\njust more -- and analytics and an ecosystem."},"836":{"dur":3,"text":"When I say \"the right platform,\" you know,\nInternet of Things, you all know this."},"840":{"dur":1,"text":"It's about real-time data."},"841":{"dur":4,"text":"But what most people can't do is as a result\nof the insights take immediate action."},"847":{"dur":1,"text":"You need a platform to do that."},"849":{"dur":5,"text":"We've built out a cloud platform in 41\ncountries, a platform called Bluemix for those"},"855":{"dur":1,"text":"of you that build the applications."},"857":{"dur":4,"text":"The largest cloud foundry deployment\nin the world, 120 services."},"862":{"dur":5,"text":"Then the services and software for a hybrid\nworld to connect to your existing businesses,"},"867":{"dur":4,"text":"and then Watson APIs that allow you\nto put cognition in everything you do."},"873":{"dur":3,"text":"Second thing, you're going to\nneed new forms of data, new forms."},"876":{"dur":1,"text":"I just said there's so much."},"879":{"dur":4,"text":"But what I mean by new is we're committed\nto help you, and part of that is by building"},"883":{"dur":3,"text":"out a huge capability on data and analytics."},"887":{"dur":4,"text":"We are approaching $30 billion of investment\nin having built analytics capabilities,"},"893":{"dur":4,"text":"including 30 acquisitions, 15,000\nexperts, hundreds of mathematicians."},"898":{"dur":5,"text":"But we also need to bring you data\nthat you don't possess but you need."},"903":{"dur":3,"text":"How do you make sense of some\npretty big amounts of social data?"},"907":{"dur":2,"text":"It needs to be curated, Twitter, Facebook."},"910":{"dur":0,"text":"Or, the weather."},"912":{"dur":1,"text":"Everybody in here working on Internet of Things,"},"914":{"dur":3,"text":"the weather is the most pervasive\nimpacting source of data there is."},"919":{"dur":4,"text":"And you may or may not be aware, it's why\nthe IBM Company acquired The Weather Company."},"925":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, those of you, everybody's got a weather\napp, and probably theirs is on your phone."},"929":{"dur":4,"text":"When you hit it, you might just think it's\ngoing to one of the government weather agencies."},"934":{"dur":0,"text":"Well, not true."},"935":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a very sophisticated real-time platform."},"939":{"dur":6,"text":"Three billion weather reference points a day\nare collected, sophisticated in analytics,"},"945":{"dur":5,"text":"and anywhere from 36 to 30 billion\ntransactions a day go against that."},"951":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, we're going to combine weather\nwith all your operational data."},"954":{"dur":6,"text":"And then next up, since that platform can\ngo way beyond weather, telematics, sensors,"},"962":{"dur":2,"text":"and you can start to see what\nyou could do for insurance risk,"},"965":{"dur":2,"text":"for retail demand, for auto safety."},"968":{"dur":5,"text":"In many ways, The Weather Company, it's\nan IoT company, and weather just happened"},"973":{"dur":2,"text":"to be one of the first use cases it had."},"977":{"dur":3,"text":"There's a second then kind of data\nthat I think you're going to need,"},"981":{"dur":1,"text":"and some of you started, but not everyone."},"983":{"dur":5,"text":"It's the huge flood of video that will matter in\nthis world of Internet of Things and cognitive."},"990":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, streaming is growing exponentially."},"992":{"dur":2,"text":"If you look at all the data\nin the world a different way,"},"995":{"dur":2,"text":"80 percent of it is going to end up being video."},"997":{"dur":3,"text":"If you're in entertainment,\nmedia, you understand that."},"1002":{"dur":2,"text":"But it will now transform every\nindustry, it won't matter."},"1005":{"dur":4,"text":"How many of us, you don't have to turn on the\nnews to think about a police car with a cam"},"1010":{"dur":2,"text":"or a policeman with a lapel camera."},"1013":{"dur":4,"text":"Those of you in retail, I think you\nknow that, if someone sees a video,"},"1018":{"dur":1,"text":"they're two times more likely to buy."},"1020":{"dur":3,"text":"So, we've added video services\nto all of our Internet"},"1023":{"dur":3,"text":"of Things cloud, over the top video services."},"1027":{"dur":4,"text":"You're probably surprised, but we do that\nalready today for Wimbledon, for the Masters,"},"1032":{"dur":4,"text":"for NFL, for HBO, for Sony Movie\nChannel, for Time Warner, for Verizon."},"1037":{"dur":6,"text":"Anyone can serve up the right video at the right\nmoment, and we are just starting on being able"},"1044":{"dur":4,"text":"to prepare for you a lot of this dark data\nthat you need but you don't have to own."},"1049":{"dur":3,"text":"So, two critical success\nfactors: the first, the platform;"},"1053":{"dur":2,"text":"the second, new forms of data and analytics."},"1056":{"dur":1,"text":"And then the third is an ecosystem."},"1058":{"dur":4,"text":"And that brings me to the most exciting\npart of, I hope, this afternoon together."},"1063":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, we're very committed to build these out by\nindustry and by domain, and we're well underway."},"1069":{"dur":6,"text":"Watson Health, we announced back in April with\nmany partners: Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic,"},"1076":{"dur":4,"text":"CVS, Epic, Boston Children's\nHospital, Memorial Sloan-Kettering,"},"1080":{"dur":2,"text":"the cancer center, Apple Research Kit."},"1083":{"dur":1,"text":"We've done a number of acquisitions."},"1085":{"dur":5,"text":"But last month we also announced\nour Watson IoT business."},"1091":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, we've been working in IoT for quite\na long time already, 4,000 clients,"},"1095":{"dur":4,"text":"seven of the 10 largest auto companies,\neight of 10 largest oil and gas,"},"1101":{"dur":2,"text":"and 11 of 12 aerospace and defense."},"1104":{"dur":5,"text":"But now this is about bringing\ncognition into IoT."},"1109":{"dur":4,"text":"Back to where I started, I really believe\nthis will insert any IoT that's going"},"1114":{"dur":2,"text":"to differentiate you in the\nfuture will have to be cognitive."},"1118":{"dur":5,"text":"And we opened up this unit, we headquartered\nit in Germany, headquartered in Munich,"},"1123":{"dur":3,"text":"a thousand people are there but there\nare eight centers around the world."},"1127":{"dur":4,"text":"We have the Watson IoT set of\nanalytics, Watson IoT cloud platform,"},"1131":{"dur":3,"text":"and then a whole, whole ecosystem of partners."},"1136":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's what I want to now show you, is\nthe partners we've brought today; and in fact,"},"1140":{"dur":3,"text":"the announcements we'll be\nmaking, because the Watson Internet"},"1143":{"dur":3,"text":"of Things is not a future it is here today."},"1147":{"dur":4,"text":"And I have got three great announcements\nhere and the leaders of their companies"},"1152":{"dur":1,"text":"to join me to show you some of this."},"1154":{"dur":5,"text":"So, let me now, with great pleasure, give\nyou a little introduction to my first guest."},"1160":{"dur":0,"text":"Many of you know him."},"1162":{"dur":0,"text":"Kevin Plank."},"1163":{"dur":2,"text":"He is the founder, CEO of

through\npassion, design; and of course,"},"1185":{"dur":1,"text":"relentless pursuit of innovation."},"1187":{"dur":1,"text":"I have gotten to know Kevin."},"1189":{"dur":2,"text":"You will find he is just getting started."},"1192":{"dur":3,"text":"And we are announcing here\ntoday our partnership,"},"1195":{"dur":2,"text":"and you're going to see the beginning\nof the app that's rolling out now"},"1199":{"dur":1,"text":"to transform personal health and fitness."},"1201":{"dur":2,"text":"Kevin coined the word \"connected fitness.\""},"1204":{"dur":1,"text":"UA Record is their

with\nan ecosystem that has today counting more"},"1300":{"dur":4,"text":"than 160 million people amongst our\nconnected four apps that we have."},"1305":{"dur":3,"text":"And the question that we want to answer\nand why IBM Watson can be such a difference"},"1308":{"dur":3,"text":"for our brand is that why\nis it that we know more"},"1311":{"dur":3,"text":"about our own cars than we\ndo about our own bodies?"},"1316":{"dur":0,"text":"We get into our cars."},"1317":{"dur":3,"text":"We know how much gas, we know how much\noil, we know how much tire pressure."},"1320":{"dur":1,"text":"We can run

better."},"1341":{"dur":4,"text":"So, when you think about that, imagine what\nthat could mean for you as you look at life,"},"1345":{"dur":4,"text":"and that's where we basically began to create\nthis ecosystem that we call connected fitness"},"1349":{"dur":1,"text":"that began just about two years ago."},"1351":{"dur":2,"text":"ROMETTY: So, connected fitness,\nand I would recommend to anyone"},"1354":{"dur":4,"text":"in the audience a Wired magazine\narticle came out about two days ago,"},"1358":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't know if...I hope you read it,\nit's a great article about Under Armour."},"1362":{"dur":3,"text":"And really Kevin kind of coined, I\nthink, this phrase \"connected fitness.\""},"1366":{"dur":4,"text":"And in fact, you're the original wearables\nin many ways, traditional and now new."},"1370":{"dur":2,"text":"ROMETTY: So, talk a little\nbit about connected fitness."},"1373":{"dur":3,"text":"PLANK: So, more than two years ago, we\nlooked at our company and today, 14,000;"},"1376":{"dur":2,"text":"a little more than 8,000\njust a couple years ago."},"1379":{"dur":1,"text":"And you look at the size and\nscale we had, and we looked"},"1381":{"dur":2,"text":"and said we didn't have enough\nreally smart people."},"1383":{"dur":3,"text":"We didn't have enough engineers working in our\nbusiness, attracting them to sporting goods."},"1387":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, the goal we had is that while\nwe recognized the future was going to be"},"1391":{"dur":4,"text":"in what we called wearables and digital, and\nwhat was our play on digital and we decided"},"1396":{"dur":2,"text":"that getting into hardware wasn't\nexactly what we wanted to do,"},"1398":{"dur":1,"text":"and our bet was going to be on community."},"1400":{"dur":3,"text":"We made our first acquisition with\na company called Map My Fitness"},"1403":{"dur":1,"text":"or Map My Run, Map My Ride."},"1405":{"dur":1,"text":"ROMETTY: How many people use those things?"},"1406":{"dur":0,"text":"Anybody?"},"1407":{"dur":1,"text":"Look at that, tons of hands already."},"1409":{"dur":1,"text":"PLANK: So, you'll see hands going up."},"1411":{"dur":3,"text":"There were 20 million registered users\nwhen we bought the company December of '13,"},"1414":{"dur":4,"text":"and in just 12 months, it grew over\n50 percent to 32 million users."},"1419":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, when you look at what\nthat meant and the size and scale,"},"1423":{"dur":3,"text":"we then decided that we weren't\nasking the right answer,"},"1427":{"dur":2,"text":"is that we didn't have the\nright question to ask."},"1429":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, we decided that in betting on\ncommunity, agnostic was very important"},"1432":{"dur":1,"text":"and open platform was very important to us."},"1434":{"dur":3,"text":"So, we decided to double down on\nwhat we had with Map My Fitness."},"1437":{"dur":2,"text":"We bought two more companies:\none called EndoMondo,"},"1439":{"dur":3,"text":"which is a GPS tracking application\njust like Map My Run or Map My

Albert."},"1449":{"dur":2,"text":"And this was the nutrition site, it\nwas really the third leg of the stool."},"1452":{"dur":3,"text":"And we thought that if we could contain this\namount of data and put it in the one place"},"1456":{"dur":3,"text":"and be able to truly empower the consumer\nwith information that would give them,"},"1460":{"dur":2,"text":"allow them to enrich and able\ntheir

now."},"1478":{"dur":1,"text":"ROMETTY: So, now they also made --"},"1479":{"dur":2,"text":"and Kevin made an announcement yesterday\n-- something called the Health Box."},"1482":{"dur":1,"text":"So, add on now."},"1483":{"dur":2,"text":"So, start with the concept of\ncommunity and now the Health Box."},"1486":{"dur":3,"text":"PLANK: Well, we were definitely playing chess\nand not checkers when we got into this game."},"1490":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, what that meant is\nthat our play was on the King"},"1492":{"dur":2,"text":"of how can we truly enrich\nlives in our community?"},"1494":{"dur":4,"text":"So, now, again, counting more than 160 million\npeople, Health Box is meant to be a system"},"1499":{"dur":3,"text":"because wearables to date have never really\ngiven you true information about yourself."},"1503":{"dur":4,"text":"Sure, they'll tell you how many steps you\ntook or it will tell you how long you slept."},"1508":{"dur":3,"text":"But allowing me or empowering me to make\nproactive decisions about my life or my health"},"1511":{"dur":2,"text":"and fitness is something that\nwe believed needed a system."},"1514":{"dur":1,"text":"And the system comes in three parts."},"1516":{"dur":4,"text":"The first part is the wearable device\nthat you have, and Ginni has one as well."},"1520":{"dur":2,"text":"It will track how much you\nsleep, it will track your steps."},"1522":{"dur":1,"text":"It will also do a number of other things"},"1524":{"dur":3,"text":"in checking resting heart\nrate and several other pieces."},"1527":{"dur":0,"text":"It has [accelerometry] in it."},"1529":{"dur":1,"text":"The second devices is the heart rate strap."},"1531":{"dur":3,"text":"It decides when you're going to exercise,\nit will tell you how hard you exercised,"},"1534":{"dur":1,"text":"how many calories that you burned."},"1535":{"dur":0,"text":"And the third is the scale."},"1537":{"dur":2,"text":"And the idea of this is being able to\ntrack your weight on a daily basis."},"1540":{"dur":3,"text":"And if we can give you this\nfrictionless devices, including the band"},"1543":{"dur":3,"text":"which has a seven day battery life and\ncharges in less than an hour, you know,"},"1546":{"dur":2,"text":"it's something we believe it create\na true picture of the consumer."},"1549":{"dur":2,"text":"It's something that we have called\nthe record platform that we hope"},"1552":{"dur":3,"text":"to eventually merge our consumers into\nand say, if I know how much I slept,"},"1555":{"dur":4,"text":"if I know how many steps I took, if I know what\nI weigh, if I know how much I ate and what I put"},"1560":{"dur":4,"text":"in my body, imagine what we can do to\narticulate a true definition for the consumer"},"1564":{"dur":1,"text":"that can make them actually feel better."},"1567":{"dur":3,"text":"ROMETTY: So, this takes us to\nthe first, it's actually going"},"1570":{"dur":5,"text":"to be a very I think exciting run together\nhere, but the first announcement, which is,"},"1575":{"dur":2,"text":"obviously, UA Records powered by Watson."},"1578":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, you'll see the very first thing,\nso why don't you talk a little bit about,"},"1581":{"dur":4,"text":"and you're actually going to show some of\nthe very first insights Watson offers here."},"1585":{"dur":2,"text":"PLANK: So, the exciting thing\nabout this is what it can really do."},"1588":{"dur":4,"text":"Again, there's three components that go into\nwhat makes...or, four components that really,"},"1593":{"dur":5,"text":"the four quadrants, as we call it, on the\napp: sleep, activity, fitness and nutrition."},"1600":{"dur":3,"text":"There's two other components that we\nadded to that, as I said earlier, weight;"},"1604":{"dur":2,"text":"and the last component is this\nthing called how do you feel?"},"1607":{"dur":4,"text":"So, imagine if you could capture all this data\nin just one place and have one daily dashboard"},"1611":{"dur":4,"text":"for health because you think about it\nand go, I know more about, again, my car."},"1615":{"dur":3,"text":"I know more about my portfolio\nor my stock or my bank balance"},"1619":{"dur":1,"text":"than I do about my own health and fitness."},"1620":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's a subjective answer."},"1622":{"dur":4,"text":"So, if we can only take something from, a)\ntaking those four quadrants, adding weight,"},"1626":{"dur":4,"text":"and then this last feature that we call \"how do\nyou feel,\" being able to rate yourself on a one"},"1631":{"dur":3,"text":"to 10 scale on a daily basis\nthat just says, how do you feel?"},"1635":{"dur":3,"text":"If I feel great, I feel like a 10; if I\ndon't feel so good, I feel like a one."},"1638":{"dur":2,"text":"And be able to take that insight\nand take that information and say,"},"1641":{"dur":4,"text":"imagine if I could look then and I can truly\ntake myself and allow myself to be able"},"1646":{"dur":3,"text":"to make proactive decisions about the\ndays that I rated myself a nine or a 10."},"1650":{"dur":1,"text":"Because you look and you\nthink, what does that mean?"},"1652":{"dur":3,"text":"Because there's three ways that we hope that\npeople will be able to compare themselves."},"1655":{"dur":2,"text":"You can compete if you'd like, but\nhopefully you're going to compare yourself"},"1658":{"dur":2,"text":"against number one, comparing against myself."},"1661":{"dur":4,"text":"If I have this data of the wheel, as we call\nit, and be able to look at it on a monthly basis"},"1666":{"dur":4,"text":"and say last month that my data, my\ninformation, it basically looked like this,"},"1671":{"dur":4,"text":"and there were three days where I rated\nmyself a nine or a 10, what's the activity"},"1675":{"dur":3,"text":"that I did leading up that allowed\nme to rate myself at nine or 10?"},"1679":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, I slept at least seven hours."},"1680":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, I definitely exercised in the morning."},"1683":{"dur":5,"text":"I ate no more in the My Fitness Pal protocol of\neither registering whether you had a heavy day"},"1689":{"dur":2,"text":"of eating, an average day of\neating, or a light day of eating."},"1691":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I had no more than an average day of eating."},"1694":{"dur":5,"text":"And then third, the third quality that we\nhave is the ability to take this information"},"1699":{"dur":1,"text":"and to truly be able to do something with it."},"1702":{"dur":3,"text":"The second component is the nature\nof competing with your friends."},"1706":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I know how I competed against myself\nlast...yesterday, last week, last month."},"1710":{"dur":3,"text":"But how do I compare against my friends,\nothers like me, whether it's my friends"},"1714":{"dur":2,"text":"from high school, my friends\nfrom work, my family."},"1717":{"dur":3,"text":"And the third component is this\nfeature where we brought in IBM Watson."},"1721":{"dur":5,"text":"And this is the feature that tells us about what\nit means to find people that are just like me."},"1727":{"dur":4,"text":"So, just like me imagines that in my data\nset, of the 160 million people that we have"},"1731":{"dur":5,"text":"on our platform today, I have an ecosystem\nof roughly between 40 to 45 year old males,"},"1737":{"dur":3,"text":"there's 4.6 million males just like me."},"1741":{"dur":5,"text":"And of those 4.6 million males, the\naverage weight of them is 192.4 pounds."},"1747":{"dur":4,"text":"The average run for those that decide to\ngo and exercise that use jogging or running"},"1752":{"dur":2,"text":"for their exercise, they run at least 4.1 miles."},"1755":{"dur":2,"text":"Their average sleep is 6 hours and 38 minutes."},"1758":{"dur":4,"text":"Their average calories consumed on\na daily basis is 2,174 calories."},"1763":{"dur":5,"text":"And imagine if I know that if I eat less\nthan 2,000 calories and I have a weight goal"},"1769":{"dur":5,"text":"of losing 10 pounds in some period of time,\nI can start dialing in the things that I need"},"1774":{"dur":4,"text":"to do, the decisions that I need to make in\norder to make proactive decisions to improve"},"1778":{"dur":1,"text":"and ultimately to enrich my life."},"1781":{"dur":2,"text":"In the future, we dream and\nwe think about insights,"},"1783":{"dur":2,"text":"the way that Watson will be able to empower us."},"1785":{"dur":3,"text":"And there's things like whether it's an example\nfrom the American Cancer Society study that says"},"1789":{"dur":2,"text":"that spending an excessive amount\nof time sitting at least six hours"},"1792":{"dur":4,"text":"or more during the day decreases a\nperson's life expectancy regardless"},"1796":{"dur":1,"text":"of whether they exercise or not."},"1799":{"dur":2,"text":"This is an insight that Watson will\ngive you, kind of...it's pretty scary"},"1802":{"dur":2,"text":"at some level but it's also empowering."},"1804":{"dur":2,"text":"It allows you to make decisions\nto improve your life."},"1807":{"dur":3,"text":"In the future, it will deliver a personalized\ncall to action based on your activity."},"1810":{"dur":3,"text":"For instance, if my ideal sleep time is seven\nhours and I only slept five and I was planning"},"1814":{"dur":2,"text":"on going for a run because I\nalways go for runs on Thursdays,"},"1817":{"dur":4,"text":"it may recommend that I maybe just take a class,\ndo the elliptical, perhaps do a yoga class"},"1821":{"dur":2,"text":"or something a little less\nstressful or a little less tense."},"1825":{"dur":4,"text":"That's the type of information that we\nbelieve we have, I think, to bring to bear."},"1830":{"dur":5,"text":"So, when Watson is taking the programming of\n160 million people just like me and be able"},"1835":{"dur":3,"text":"to deliver that back in a proactive\nway for me and for Under Armour,"},"1838":{"dur":2,"text":"and frankly for all consumers\nall over the globe."},"1840":{"dur":3,"text":"And again, simplicity is at the key of whether\nit's Health Box or whether it's the data"},"1844":{"dur":1,"text":"and the information you get,\nor whether it's the simplicity"},"1846":{"dur":1,"text":"of just looking at that basic wheel every day."},"1848":{"dur":3,"text":"ROMETTY: So, the first capabilities\nyou'll see with Watson are Just Like Me,"},"1851":{"dur":2,"text":"and then goes on from there\nto the Cognitive Coaching."},"1854":{"dur":2,"text":"You want to talk one minute about Cognitive\nCoaching, and we'll wrap up on that."},"1857":{"dur":2,"text":"PLANK: So, we believe the\nfuture we have in the world is"},"1860":{"dur":2,"text":"like how will coaching truly be able to help me?"},"1862":{"dur":4,"text":"And that is where you're using things and saying\nlike, to be my coach, again, within my data set"},"1867":{"dur":6,"text":"of the 4.6 million males just like me, how can I\nreally lean on Watson being able to triangulate"},"1873":{"dur":2,"text":"in a workout plan or a program for me?"},"1876":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, things that it will be able\nto give me the data on a daily basis."},"1879":{"dur":1,"text":"Again, in a very subtle way."},"1880":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not marketing to you,\nit's not advertising to you."},"1882":{"dur":2,"text":"It's just simply giving you\ninformation where it doesn't have"},"1885":{"dur":2,"text":"to be a personal trainer that costs $80 an hour."},"1887":{"dur":3,"text":"It could actually be a Watson system that\nwill personalize something just for me,"},"1891":{"dur":2,"text":"finding others that are just\nlike me who want to get better."},"1893":{"dur":3,"text":"ROMETTY: So, I think, Kevin, together, I\nthink we both believe we will change lives."},"1897":{"dur":4,"text":"And at the same time, I think one of\nKevin's famous sayings he always says"},"1901":{"dur":1,"text":"to his own team is, but at the same time,"},"1903":{"dur":2,"text":"we're going to still sell shirts\nand T-shirts and sneakers."},"1906":{"dur":1,"text":"So, at the same time."},"1907":{"dur":1,"text":"PLANK: It's a very simple process."},"1909":{"dur":2,"text":"It's like, we're going to do a lot of\ncool stuff, but at the end of the day,"},"1911":{"dur":2,"text":"the one thing we know, the more\npeople exercise and work out,"},"1914":{"dur":1,"text":"the more shirts and shoes they're going to buy."},"1915":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's a very...there's a\nlogic to all of this, believe me."},"1918":{"dur":2,"text":"So, we encourage you all to know\nhow much you're working out,"},"1920":{"dur":1,"text":"know how much you're sleeping,\nknow how much you're exercising."},"1922":{"dur":2,"text":"And then again, don't forget\nto buy shirts and shoes."},"1924":{"dur":0,"text":"ROMETTY: You got it."},"1925":{"dur":0,"text":"PLANK: Thank you so much,

able to use Watson\nalready in the app first round,"},"1939":{"dur":3,"text":"and he is just like any learning\nsystem, going to continue to get better."},"1943":{"dur":5,"text":"So, kind of keeping in that same theme, my\nnext guest and my next partner to introduce"},"1948":{"dur":4,"text":"to you is Omar Ishrak, who is\nthe Chair and CEO of Medtronic."},"1953":{"dur":3,"text":"A global healthcare company around the\nworld, many of you I I'm sure know them,"},"1958":{"dur":3,"text":"because they're a leading global\nhealthcare medical technology company."},"1961":{"dur":5,"text":"So, almost $30 billion in revenue,\n85,000 employees, 160 countries."},"1967":{"dur":3,"text":"And actually, a company like\nMedtronic, if you've got any illness"},"1971":{"dur":1,"text":"in your family,

money for\nthe healthcare systems around the world"},"2158":{"dur":5,"text":"because patients have to be treated and then\nmonitored continuously to keep them alive."},"2164":{"dur":2,"text":"And some of them have catastrophic conditions"},"2166":{"dur":3,"text":"which require emergency room visit\nthat are even more expensive."},"2169":{"dur":3,"text":"So, it costs something like\n$600 billion a year globally."},"2173":{"dur":2,"text":"That's the spend from healthcare\nsystems around the world."},"2176":{"dur":4,"text":"So, it's a very, you know, big disease that\naffects a lot of people, costs a lot of money."},"2181":{"dur":6,"text":"But at the same time, it's a disease where\nself-management can both be a blessing --"},"2188":{"dur":5,"text":"in other words, by self managing you can stay\nwell and lead more or less a normal life --"},"2193":{"dur":2,"text":"or it can be really damaging in that you go"},"2196":{"dur":3,"text":"to the emergency room every three\nmonths and have risk of death."},"2200":{"dur":5,"text":"And worse still, even if you get through\nthat, you may have long-term complications"},"2206":{"dur":4,"text":"like amputation or blindness or cardiac disease."},"2210":{"dur":4,"text":"So, it's an area which if\nwe can make a difference in,"},"2215":{"dur":1,"text":"we'll have a big impact in healthcare."},"2217":{"dur":2,"text":"ROMETTY: So, maybe share\nwith everyone, because again,"},"2219":{"dur":3,"text":"it's the number six most\ndeadly disease here in America."},"2223":{"dur":5,"text":"So, talk about what happens today and\nhow cognitive and Watson can help,"},"2228":{"dur":2,"text":"because maybe describe what happens today."},"2231":{"dur":3,"text":"I think everyone imagines that, no, this\nis already monitored, and you can tell."},"2235":{"dur":0,"text":"It's not true."},"2236":{"dur":5,"text":"ISHRAK: No, it's not true because most of\nthe diabetes patients, in fact, have medication"},"2242":{"dur":1,"text":"or deliver insulin by themselves."},"2244":{"dur":2,"text":"In some instances, they have pumps."},"2246":{"dur":4,"text":"And they're categorized into different\nstages of intensiveness, the disease."},"2251":{"dur":4,"text":"But in almost all of these cases,\nthe amount of time they interface"},"2256":{"dur":2,"text":"with the healthcare system\nactually is very limited."},"2258":{"dur":4,"text":"It happens maybe once every three or four\nmonths, maybe a little shorter than that."},"2263":{"dur":3,"text":"And usually the visit with the doctor\nis a 10-minute

described, diabetes is\na disease that requires continuous management."},"2277":{"dur":4,"text":"It changes by the minute depending on the stress\nlevel of the person, what the person's

that because\nthat is the way in which we do things today --"},"2301":{"dur":3,"text":"is nowhere near where it can\nbe and where it should be."},"2304":{"dur":4,"text":"And the Internet of Things, by being\nable to capture data and help manage"},"2309":{"dur":2,"text":"that patient's life, can\nmake a dramatic difference."},"2312":{"dur":3,"text":"ROMETTY: So, I'm going to ask Omar\nto now actually show you a demo."},"2315":{"dur":1,"text":"This is going to be out this summer."},"2317":{"dur":2,"text":"And again, back to the big differentiation."},"2319":{"dur":4,"text":"It's one thing to capture all this data; it\nis another thing to do predictions with it"},"2324":{"dur":3,"text":"and learning -- learning about\nthe individual, the cohort."},"2327":{"dur":3,"text":"And you will see, as I said,\nthe ability to predict an onset,"},"2330":{"dur":2,"text":"a hypoglycemic event, three hours in advance."},"2333":{"dur":4,"text":"So, it's my pleasure actually\nto describe this app for you,"},"2338":{"dur":1,"text":"which is essentially a Medtronic app."},"2340":{"dur":5,"text":"But as I'll describe in a few\nminutes, Watson really takes it"},"2346":{"dur":2,"text":"to a different league of performance."},"2349":{"dur":4,"text":"So, this is a screen, a screenshot\npotentially of a person with diabetes."},"2354":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, I'll talk about a fictional\nperson, let's name him William."},"2357":{"dur":4,"text":"And in the screen it shows that\nWilliam has burnt something"},"2362":{"dur":1,"text":"like 1,500 calories for that day."},"2364":{"dur":3,"text":"And you know, a lot of this can happen\nbecause it's just a metabolic rate."},"2368":{"dur":5,"text":"It can probably burn 1,000 calories or\nsomething by midday for different people,"},"2374":{"dur":2,"text":"and then he might have done some\nexercise, and he's gone up to 1,500."},"2377":{"dur":1,"text":"It could be something else for others."},"2379":{"dur":5,"text":"It also shows that William's glucose\nlevel at that instance actually is 140,"},"2385":{"dur":1,"text":"and I'll come back to that in a minute."},"2387":{"dur":1,"text":"But at that instance, that's what it is."},"2389":{"dur":4,"text":"And it also shows that is amount of\nfood that he's eaten has resulted"},"2393":{"dur":2,"text":"in carbohydrate intake of 14 grams."},"2395":{"dur":1,"text":"So, this is probably being entered manually."},"2398":{"dur":5,"text":"So, that's like a dashboard, if you\nlike, an instantaneous dashboard"},"2403":{"dur":3,"text":"of William's physical condition\nat a point in time."},"2407":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, let's talk about the glucose\nnumber because that's most interesting"},"2411":{"dur":2,"text":"and least understood in many ways."},"2414":{"dur":7,"text":"Now, the glucose number for 140, this is really\nthe instantaneous number, but as you can see,"},"2421":{"dur":5,"text":"there's a graph there, which shows a\ntrend, which means that we have integrated"},"2426":{"dur":3,"text":"into this app data from a continuous\nglucose monitor that we make."},"2431":{"dur":2,"text":"Typically, and many of you may know this,"},"2433":{"dur":2,"text":"the way in which you measure glucose\nis that you do a finger prick test."},"2437":{"dur":2,"text":"You get a little blood from\nyour finger, put it in a meter"},"2439":{"dur":3,"text":"and you get a reading at one point in time."},"2443":{"dur":3,"text":"And at most, people will do this maybe\nat most three or four times a day,"},"2446":{"dur":2,"text":"sometimes once a day, sometimes\neven less than that."},"2449":{"dur":4,"text":"This is a continuous monitor,\nso it shows the glucose status"},"2454":{"dur":2,"text":"of that person at every point in time."},"2457":{"dur":4,"text":"And so from that, you can get real\ntrends, not just different kind"},"2462":{"dur":2,"text":"of sample points over a day or so."},"2465":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that's very important\ndata, and it's used together"},"2468":{"dur":2,"text":"with the others to make a bigger difference."},"2471":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, let's say William is sitting\nwith his wife Anna in a restaurant,"},"2475":{"dur":1,"text":"and they are preparing to have a meal."},"2478":{"dur":2,"text":"So William looks at his dashboard\nand says, well,"},"2480":{"dur":3,"text":"if I'm going to eat something,\nwhat's that going to do to me?"},"2483":{"dur":7,"text":"So, he decides, I'm going to order a\ncertain type of food, and the app now comes"},"2490":{"dur":4,"text":"out with a prediction saying that, look, if\nyou eat this -- and in this case, it's pasta,"},"2495":{"dur":5,"text":"a pasta salad, it knows what the carbohydrate\ncontent is, what the fat content is."},"2500":{"dur":3,"text":"And from that, it predicts, look, if\nyou do this, it's going to do this"},"2503":{"dur":2,"text":"to your total carbohydrate budget for that day,"},"2507":{"dur":3,"text":"and it gives that useful\ninformation for William."},"2511":{"dur":6,"text":"Now, it could be that this is enough, that\nWilliam knows this, is sort of familiar"},"2517":{"dur":1,"text":"with his condition, and he's fine."},"2519":{"dur":1,"text":"He eats it, and he goes along."},"2521":{"dur":2,"text":"But you know what I just described to\nyou, all that's in the dashboard and it's"},"2524":{"dur":5,"text":"in the app is something that requires William to\nreally kind of think about stuff, think about,"},"2529":{"dur":1,"text":"you know, I just...I'm having a meal."},"2531":{"dur":1,"text":"I've got so many calories."},"2532":{"dur":2,"text":"I've already had so much carbohydrate."},"2534":{"dur":1,"text":"My sugar level is 140."},"2537":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm probably going to be okay."},"2539":{"dur":5,"text":"He may be right; he may be wrong -- because he's\njust using his mind now very intuitively based"},"2544":{"dur":2,"text":"on his own personal experience,\nas to what something will do."},"2547":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, that is not going to be even close\nto what something like Watson can do."},"2553":{"dur":6,"text":"So, Watson comes in now, and we insert Watson\ninto the equation, and then Watson does a check,"},"2559":{"dur":2,"text":"if you like, as to, is this okay or not?"},"2562":{"dur":5,"text":"In this particular example, in the app that\nwe're launching, we've got Watson coming in"},"2568":{"dur":3,"text":"and saying that, again, in\nthis fictional example, look,"},"2572":{"dur":2,"text":"while you may think it's okay, it really isn't."},"2575":{"dur":4,"text":"And an advisory alert actually goes\nout in this situation and says that,"},"2579":{"dur":1,"text":"watch out, there's something wrong here."},"2581":{"dur":2,"text":"At this point in time, you'd better look."},"2583":{"dur":1,"text":"So, there's an advisory note."},"2584":{"dur":1,"text":"So, William clicks on that."},"2587":{"dur":2,"text":"An advisory note comes out\nand says that well, watch out."},"2590":{"dur":4,"text":"Based on your own history, based on data and\nnot on your intuition anymore, based on data,"},"2594":{"dur":7,"text":"you know, you've done so much exercise, and\nrecently you've had so many carbs and so on."},"2601":{"dur":5,"text":"So, based on that, you're actually going\nto get a hypoglycemic event in three hours."},"2607":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, hypoglycemic means your sugar level gets\nso low that you essentially cannot function."},"2611":{"dur":5,"text":"If taken to an extreme, you get a\nseizure, you get a coma and then you die."},"2617":{"dur":1,"text":"Literally, that's how it is."},"2619":{"dur":3,"text":"And some people, this can happen\nwhen they're nowhere near a hospital."},"2623":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, if you get to a medical place, they can\nprobably rescue you, but it's not a good thing."},"2627":{"dur":5,"text":"And so William sees this, and he sees a\ntrend that says, look, in three hours,"},"2633":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to get a hypoglycemic event."},"2635":{"dur":2,"text":"And as Ginni pointed out,\nthe state of the art today is"},"2638":{"dur":2,"text":"that the only warning you\nget is you don't feel well."},"2641":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, you may not feel well for a\nwhole bunch of different things."},"2644":{"dur":1,"text":"It could be this, or it couldn't be."},"2646":{"dur":3,"text":"And you know, it's a flip of a coin if you\ndecide that it's really serious or not."},"2651":{"dur":4,"text":"But through Watson and through this, a\nthree-hour prediction is plenty of time."},"2656":{"dur":5,"text":"William's glucose at that instant is within\nthe safe zone, that gray area of the safe zone."},"2662":{"dur":4,"text":"William's fine, and he can now take\naction, saying, look, I really,"},"2666":{"dur":3,"text":"the pasta that I ordered, that's probably\nnot enough because if that's all I have based"},"2670":{"dur":3,"text":"on what I've done so far already, I'm\ngoing to get a hypoglycemic event."},"2673":{"dur":1,"text":"So, I'd better eat something else."},"2675":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'm going to eat a little\napple or something like that,"},"2678":{"dur":1,"text":"and William knows best, and he does that."},"2680":{"dur":3,"text":"And he does that, and actually\nthen what happens is"},"2683":{"dur":3,"text":"that a hypoglycemic event\ndoes not happen at all."},"2687":{"dur":4,"text":"And so the trend shows that...the app then\nshows that, yes, the glucose level goes"},"2692":{"dur":4,"text":"up a little bit because of the eating, but\nit doesn't go down to a dangerous level"},"2696":{"dur":2,"text":"and then settles down again over time."},"2699":{"dur":5,"text":"So, I hope what you can see here, that Watson\nmakes a fundamental difference not only"},"2705":{"dur":3,"text":"to the quality of life of William\nbut potentially saved his life."},"2709":{"dur":4,"text":"And if this is rolled out over millions\nof people, you can see what it will do"},"2715":{"dur":5,"text":"to extending life, in many ways, restoring\nhealth, alleviating lots of the pain."},"2721":{"dur":1,"text":"That's what our mission is all about."},"2723":{"dur":4,"text":"And not only that, think of the\namount of efficiency it will create"},"2728":{"dur":5,"text":"in the healthcare system, wasted\nmoney in emergency room visits"},"2733":{"dur":7,"text":"and all of that can be curtailed by something\nas seemingly simple but really very important,"},"2741":{"dur":2,"text":"and we feel a big breakthrough for this year."},"2743":{"dur":0,"text":"ROMETTY: It is a breakthrough."},"2744":{"dur":3,"text":"So, we felt very good about bringing\nit here today to show it to you."},"2747":{"dur":4,"text":"And as Omar said, by summer, those of you,\nlike I said, any of you that know someone"},"2752":{"dur":3,"text":"or one of your loved ones that has\ndiabetes, this makes a difference."},"2755":{"dur":1,"text":"There's no other way to tell."},"2756":{"dur":1,"text":"So, we feel great about it."},"2758":{"dur":3,"text":"The future, as you said, is not only\nabout value, other diseases and the like."},"2762":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe a last comment on that?"},"2763":{"dur":0,"text":"ISHRAK: Yes."},"2764":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, you know, before I go to other diseases,"},"2766":{"dur":3,"text":"this is still a starting\npoint for even in diabetes."},"2770":{"dur":3,"text":"In the future, we just heard the story\nfrom Under Armour, and there are lots"},"2773":{"dur":1,"text":"of parallels, as I hope you can see."},"2775":{"dur":3,"text":"In this area, data is used\nin a very specific condition."},"2779":{"dur":1,"text":"We could use activity data."},"2781":{"dur":4,"text":"We could use other kinds of wearable data\nthat will complement the glucose data"},"2785":{"dur":3,"text":"and the other data that we have here\nand make this algorithm a lot smarter."},"2789":{"dur":5,"text":"We can also through Watson start look at\nother people like William and use that data"},"2795":{"dur":2,"text":"to give even more precise recommendations."},"2798":{"dur":8,"text":"And through that, make this management of\ndiabetes something that becomes a thing"},"2806":{"dur":3,"text":"that patients don't notice that\nyou've got diabetes anymore."},"2809":{"dur":2,"text":"That's truly our goal, and that\nwould be a real cure for the disease,"},"2812":{"dur":3,"text":"and we have every expectation\nthat over time we will get there."},"2815":{"dur":0,"text":"ROMETTY: You got it."},"2816":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I know together,

umbrella,"},"2953":{"dur":4,"text":"we have the Sprint in the U.S.,\nYahoo in Japan, Alibaba in China."},"2959":{"dur":2,"text":"And we have been expanding our core business."},"2962":{"dur":5,"text":"And in 1980, SoftBank was established\nas a PC software distributor."},"2967":{"dur":1,"text":"That's why we name it SoftBank."},"2969":{"dur":4,"text":"And then in 1990, we invested in Yahoo!"},"2974":{"dur":1,"text":"to bring the customer to the Internet world."},"2976":{"dur":5,"text":"Then we entered into the Internet broadband\nbusiness, and now we are the mobile carrier"},"2982":{"dur":2,"text":"in Japan to provide the mobile\nInternet services."},"2986":{"dur":3,"text":"And the key question is,\nwhat is the next big thing"},"2989":{"dur":3,"text":"in the IT industry coming the next 30 years?"},"2994":{"dur":6,"text":"And our answer is three items:\nIoT, AI, and robotics."},"3000":{"dur":4,"text":"We definitely believe that those three\nitems will be the center of the IT business."},"3006":{"dur":2,"text":"That's why we started this robot business."},"3009":{"dur":1,"text":"ROMETTY: Now, I should tell\nyou, our partnership began"},"3011":{"dur":2,"text":"with SoftBank on bringing Watson to Japan."},"3015":{"dur":4,"text":"And in fact, as I've talked about Watson as\nsomething that understands, learns, reasons,"},"3020":{"dur":4,"text":"it's not about memorization or knowing keywords;\nWatson actually has to think in Japanese."},"3024":{"dur":4,"text":"So, we partnered with SoftBank to help\nus teach Watson to think in Japanese."},"3029":{"dur":1,"text":"So, Kent, let me ask you how that's going."},"3031":{"dur":0,"text":"YOSHIDA: Sure."},"3032":{"dur":8,"text":"Together with IBM, our teaching Watson Japanese\nproject is completed, and we have got a lot"},"3040":{"dur":6,"text":"of inquiry from the Japanese clients, and we\nstarted more than 10 projects with clients."},"3047":{"dur":5,"text":"At the same time, we are developing the\nWatson partner ecosystem network with more"},"3053":{"dur":2,"text":"than several dozen unique partners."},"3056":{"dur":3,"text":"ROMETTY: Now, I'd like...I'm going to ask Kent\nto tell you a little bit about some of these,"},"3060":{"dur":3,"text":"what happens when robotics\nand Watson comes together."},"3063":{"dur":0,"text":"YOSHIDA: Yes."},"3066":{"dur":5,"text":"Biggest differentiation from the robot\nand other smart devices like a smartphone"},"3071":{"dur":2,"text":"or the tablet, is the customer engagement."},"3075":{"dur":5,"text":"People tend to recognize a robot as\nsomething alive so that when the robot speaks"},"3081":{"dur":5,"text":"to the people, they naturally\nstop by and start conversations."},"3086":{"dur":3,"text":"So, these customer engagements\nis the one key differentiation."},"3091":{"dur":2,"text":"The other differentiation is the big data."},"3093":{"dur":5,"text":"Pepper, the robot, can gather all the big data\nsuch as how many people stopped by in front"},"3099":{"dur":6,"text":"of the robot and how many people stopped\nby the robot, and ages or the gender"},"3105":{"dur":2,"text":"of the customer and emotional as well."},"3108":{"dur":3,"text":"The robot, Pepper, can recognize\nthe emotion of the customer."},"3112":{"dur":4,"text":"So, the client can use those\nbig data to analyze the process"},"3117":{"dur":2,"text":"and improve the conversion rate, or the profit."},"3121":{"dur":6,"text":"So, if we can combine the human-like\ncustomer interface and this big data"},"3127":{"dur":7,"text":"and Watson computing power, we can create\nthe real customer service staff robot"},"3135":{"dur":4,"text":"who can serve the customer service in the\nretail industry, the hospitality industry,"},"3140":{"dur":5,"text":"the hotel or hospital or educational\nindustry with deep industry knowledge."},"3146":{"dur":3,"text":"ROMETTY: So, Kent mentioned we have a\nnumber of customers underway together."},"3149":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I asked him to speak a little\nbit about Mizuho and Nestle."},"3153":{"dur":3,"text":"And Mizuho, for those of you familiar with\nJapan, depending on what metric you look"},"3157":{"dur":1,"text":"at is the number one or two bank in Japan."},"3159":{"dur":2,"text":"And they've got Pepper walking...walking?"},"3162":{"dur":3,"text":"Rolling out, and he is already, has\n[destined] to be in 100 branches."},"3167":{"dur":5,"text":"And then Nestle, the retail outlets for\nNestle coffee, already 200, I think."},"3173":{"dur":0,"text":"ROMETTY: Almost, right?"},"3174":{"dur":1,"text":"ROMETTY: So, tell the audience a little bit"},"3175":{"dur":3,"text":"about what Watson Pepper is\ndoing in Mizuho and in Nestle."},"3179":{"dur":0,"text":"YOSHIDA: Okay."},"3180":{"dur":7,"text":"In Mizuho

Pepper is right now doing the financial\nproducts advisory service and lead the customer,"},"3200":{"dur":3,"text":"potential customer to the\nsales staff in the [counter]."},"3204":{"dur":1,"text":"So, that's Mizuho Bank."},"3205":{"dur":6,"text":"And in Nestle, Pepper is working as\na coffee machine sales staff in more"},"3212":{"dur":4,"text":"than 100 stores right now, and they\nwill expand it to a thousand stores."},"3217":{"dur":3,"text":"What Pepper is doing right now\nis Pepper is standing in front"},"3221":{"dur":4,"text":"of a coffee machine
