do today is give\nyou a short introduction"},"113":{"dur":3,"text":"to the theme, and then\nSteve will say a few words,"},"116":{"dur":3,"text":"and then we'll chat and\nanswer any questions you have."},"120":{"dur":3,"text":"And I want to start\nwith a truth and a dare"},"123":{"dur":5,"text":"around a very specific question,\nwhich is life's evolution."},"129":{"dur":5,"text":"So let's just review Bio 101\nfor two or three minutes."},"134":{"dur":2,"text":"This nice character,\nCharles Darwin, one"},"136":{"dur":4,"text":"of the greatest scientists\nand humanitarians ever born,"},"141":{"dur":1,"text":"came up with the\nnotion that life"},"143":{"dur":2,"text":"evolves according to two rules."},"146":{"dur":4,"text":"This is the first sheet of when\nhe discovers, or thinks of,"},"150":{"dur":1,"text":"It's the first time\nhe writes \"I think\""},"152":{"dur":5,"text":"and then draws a tree of\nlife as to how things evolve."},"157":{"dur":1,"text":"And this sheet was\nactually shown in Britain"},"159":{"dur":0,"text":"a few years ago."},"160":{"dur":3,"text":"It was absolutely\nmarvelous to see it."},"164":{"dur":1,"text":"So how does life evolve?"},"165":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, life evolves according\nto natural selection."},"168":{"dur":1,"text":"And what does natural\nselection mean?"},"169":{"dur":5,"text":"It means that very small\nvariations in how a bird eats,"},"175":{"dur":3,"text":"what is a predator to a\nbird, what the climate is,"},"179":{"dur":1,"text":"what diseases are\nattacking it, can"},"181":{"dur":3,"text":"lead to big changes in a body."},"184":{"dur":1,"text":"In this case the\nGalapagos finches,"},"186":{"dur":3,"text":"depending on whether there was\nwater or there wasn't water,"},"189":{"dur":4,"text":"would develop different kinds\nof beaks to have tougher seeds"},"193":{"dur":2,"text":"or to have smaller seeds."},"196":{"dur":1,"text":"In a place like\nthis what you get"},"198":{"dur":2,"text":"is a whole lot of\nnatural selection."},"200":{"dur":2,"text":"So you get these\nlittle micro-niches"},"202":{"dur":2,"text":"where all of these\ncreatures learn"},"204":{"dur":3,"text":"how to survive,\nevolve within here,"},"207":{"dur":3,"text":"and basically compete\nagainst one another."},"211":{"dur":2,"text":"And one of the ways\nin which they compete"},"213":{"dur":2,"text":"is they have their\ngenes randomly mutate."},"216":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is like a\ngene casino, where"},"219":{"dur":2,"text":"you throw the dice\nand the gene comes up"},"221":{"dur":3,"text":"with this letter or this letter\nor this letter or this letter."},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"A random mutation\nis exactly that,"},"226":{"dur":3,"text":"which is the reason why you\ncan get cats with 23 toes."},"230":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a random process."},"232":{"dur":1,"text":"Things appear and disappear."},"233":{"dur":1,"text":"They don't have an order."},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"There isn't a rhyme\nor a reason for it."},"237":{"dur":2,"text":"And those changes\nwhich are beneficial"},"239":{"dur":2,"text":"means that that creature\nhas children, who have"},"242":{"dur":2,"text":"children, who have children."},"245":{"dur":2,"text":"This occurs in human\nbeings as well."},"247":{"dur":2,"text":"And sometimes it isn't pretty."},"250":{"dur":5,"text":"Random mutation means you\ncould have six digits or seven."},"255":{"dur":3,"text":"And when you're thinking about\nthe consequences of this,"},"258":{"dur":1,"text":"sometimes when you\nhave random mutation"},"260":{"dur":1,"text":"it actually looks\nlike it makes sense."},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe if you're a coder."},"268":{"dur":4,"text":"Maybe if you're a coder you\nwould want to have six fingers."},"272":{"dur":3,"text":"Or of course, maybe if\nyou're a baseball pitcher."},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is Antonio Alfonseca."},"278":{"dur":2,"text":"His nickname was The Octopus."},"280":{"dur":4,"text":"He was born with 12\nfingers, 12 toes,"},"285":{"dur":3,"text":"and he became the relief pitcher\nof the year in the year 2000."},"289":{"dur":3,"text":"So it turns out that having\nsix fingers in the right place"},"292":{"dur":1,"text":"allows you to do\nthings as a pitcher"},"294":{"dur":2,"text":"that other people can't do."},"296":{"dur":4,"text":"Random mutation works sometimes,\nand often it does not."},"301":{"dur":1,"text":"So what are the\ndrivers of evolution?"},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"What leads to\nchanges in evolution?"},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"What creates\nevolutionary pressure?"},"307":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, you can have predators."},"308":{"dur":1,"text":"If you have a\nchange in predators."},"310":{"dur":3,"text":"If you take yourself in or\nout of different food chains,"},"313":{"dur":2,"text":"that can lead to certain\nkinds of development."},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"Changing your food,\nchanging your microbes,"},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"your environment,\nyour population."},"321":{"dur":1,"text":"If you become\ndomesticated, if you"},"323":{"dur":4,"text":"change your labor or exercise\nregime you can have changes."},"328":{"dur":3,"text":"And the key question here\nis, how many of these factors"},"331":{"dur":1,"text":"do you suppose have\nchanged for human beings"},"333":{"dur":3,"text":"in the last century or two?"},"336":{"dur":3,"text":"Do you think we have\nchanged the predators?"},"339":{"dur":3,"text":"Are we still subject to grizzly\nbears and mountain lions?"},"343":{"dur":1,"text":"Have we changed our food?"},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"Have we change the kinds\nof microbes that attack us,"},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"as we take out\nsmallpox and polio?"},"350":{"dur":2,"text":"Have we changed our\nenvironment just a little bit?"},"353":{"dur":2,"text":"Have we increased\nour population?"},"355":{"dur":4,"text":"Have we become a different\ntype of domesticated species?"},"359":{"dur":4,"text":"And the jobs we have, are they\nmostly outdoors and hard work"},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"or are they a\ndifferent kind of job?"},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"So as you go through\nthese questions let's"},"369":{"dur":1,"text":"try a mind experiment."},"370":{"dur":4,"text":"Let's draw up Charles Darwin in\nthe middle of Trafalgar Square"},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"yesterday."},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"So after the initial\nbrutal disorientation,"},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"after trying to figure out\nwhat all these cars are,"},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"he'd begin to look around\nand this is what he'd see."},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"And he'd recognize most\nof these buildings."},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"And then in his little careful\nway he'd take out his notebook"},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"and start taking notes\nand what would he see?"},"393":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, the first thing he'd\nsee is, boy, human beings"},"395":{"dur":1,"text":"have gotten awfully big."},"397":{"dur":3,"text":"Because now there's about\n1.46 billion overweight adults"},"401":{"dur":1,"text":"wandering around."},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"And of course all of you saw\nthis in your last cross country"},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"trip when the middle seat\nwas occupied by somebody"},"408":{"dur":3,"text":"who liked your seat as well."},"412":{"dur":4,"text":"House cats, house\ndogs have gotten fat."},"416":{"dur":4,"text":"The leading cause of\ninsurance claims today on pets"},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"is complications\nrelated to obesity."},"423":{"dur":1,"text":"The interesting thing\nis, it's not just"},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"domesticated pets and\nhumans that are getting fat."},"428":{"dur":3,"text":"It turns out a lot of wild\nanimals are getting fat."},"431":{"dur":1,"text":"So in fact, there's\nat least 12 species"},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"of animals that are\nsitting out there"},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"that are getting fat\nwhich you wouldn't expect."},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"Lab rats are getting\nfat, and all of you"},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"know that when you\nrun an experiment"},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"you don't want to have\nchanges in the variables."},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's very odd that\nlab monkeys, lab rats"},"448":{"dur":1,"text":"are getting fat."},"449":{"dur":3,"text":"It's even stranger that\nwild horses that eat grass"},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"are getting fat."},"455":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's not just Twinkies, it's\nnot just soft drinks out there."},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"There's something else happening\nin this environment that"},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"is leading to obesity."},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"A couple of potential\ncauses of this."},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"The subtherapeutic\nuse of antibiotics."},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"We're using a lot of\nantibiotics on farms."},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"We don't use them\nto cure disease."},"475":{"dur":1,"text":"We use them because\nwhen you feed"},"476":{"dur":4,"text":"small amounts of antibiotics\nto animals, you get weigh gain."},"481":{"dur":1,"text":"Perhaps because\nyou can break some"},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"of the microbes in the\nstomach and therefore you"},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"absorb more nutrients."},"487":{"dur":1,"text":"As we put more and\nmore antibiotics"},"489":{"dur":3,"text":"into the environment, and a\nwhole lot more antibiotics"},"493":{"dur":3,"text":"are being used for\nfood promotion,"},"496":{"dur":5,"text":"spraying it on fruit trees,\nputting it into chickens,"},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"putting it into pigs,\nthen we're putting"},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"a whole lot of antibiotics\ninto the environment."},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"Second thing that's happening\nwhich is interesting"},"508":{"dur":4,"text":"is, there's a whole class of\nchemicals called obesogens that"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"tend to promote weight gain."},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"So some of the chemicals\nin our everyday products"},"517":{"dur":3,"text":"make it easier for fat\nto accumulate in bodies."},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"And we're seeing that\neffect not just on humans,"},"523":{"dur":3,"text":"we're seeing it across\na series of animals."},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"Second thing that's\nhappening, or second thing"},"528":{"dur":3,"text":"Darwin would note is, we've\nbecome a whole lot weaker."},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"So a couple centuries\nago, most people"},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"worked hard labor someplace."},"537":{"dur":1,"text":"They were working\non assembly lines,"},"539":{"dur":1,"text":"they were working\non industrial lines,"},"540":{"dur":4,"text":"they were working on farms, they\nwere doing pretty brutal work."},"544":{"dur":2,"text":"And today of course\nwe have become coders."},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"We have become office people."},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"And sometimes if\nwe work out enough,"},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"you don't have the same\neffect, but for most of us"},"554":{"dur":5,"text":"we are quite weak compared\nto folks 150 years ago."},"559":{"dur":4,"text":"Third thing he'd notice-- boy,\nhas this population gotten old."},"564":{"dur":0,"text":"Where are all the kids?"},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"There are so many\nold people walking"},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"around Trafalgar Square."},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"And of course, if there\nwas a race coming by then"},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"you'd notice that there\nwere 75-year-olds that"},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"were beating the\nyounger people as they"},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"race by in a half marathon."},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"If you tabulate these and many\nother changes, what you find"},"583":{"dur":5,"text":"is, in a very short period of\ntime, in less than 150 years,"},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"you get really\nsubstantial changes"},"590":{"dur":3,"text":"in the morphology\nof the human body."},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"If you saw this in\nany other animal"},"596":{"dur":4,"text":"you would ask the question,\nis this a new species?"},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"And of course when you\nask that of human beings"},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"you begin to get some visions\nthat perhaps tell you,"},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"not only is it heading\nin a different direction,"},"608":{"dur":1,"text":"but it might also be mutating."},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"That leads to an\ninteresting question."},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"Were this guy\nwriting today, if he"},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"were walking through the\nlabs here in Cambridge,"},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"if he knew what we now know\nabout molecular biology,"},"623":{"dur":1,"text":"would he be writing\nthe same books?"},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"And the answer is, it's not just\nthe morphology that's changing,"},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"so are the basic\ndrivers of evolution."},"632":{"dur":1,"text":"Let me explain that."},"634":{"dur":3,"text":"For four billion years,\nnature ran the show."},"637":{"dur":1,"text":"So nature was in charge, OK?"},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"And how was nature in charge?"},"640":{"dur":1,"text":"You had natural selection."},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"So survival of the fittest,\nand you'd have this cycle,"},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"and what would happen is you'd\nget these random mutations,"},"647":{"dur":1,"text":"and the random mutations\nwould allow something"},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"that was on the verge\nof going extinct to have"},"652":{"dur":1,"text":"one version that may\nhave adapted better"},"653":{"dur":1,"text":"in that environment\nthat would then"},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"survive, have a lot of\nkids, thrive in that niche."},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"And it was this cycle\nof natural selection"},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"and random mutation\nthat determined"},"662":{"dur":5,"text":"what lived and died on earth\nfor close to 4 billion years."},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"Over the last century\nwhat's ended up"},"670":{"dur":3,"text":"happening is humans\nnow run half the show."},"673":{"dur":3,"text":"So humans determine what lives\nand dies on at least half"},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"of the surface of\nthe earth and half"},"678":{"dur":1,"text":"of the oceans of the earth."},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"And what that means is\nthat unnatural selection"},"683":{"dur":1,"text":"and nonrandom\nmutation are beginning"},"684":{"dur":4,"text":"to determine what lives and\ndies, begin to drive evolution."},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"Let me explain this."},"691":{"dur":1,"text":"So for at least half\nof life on Earth,"},"693":{"dur":3,"text":"unnatural selection looks\nsomething like this."},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"This is not what you\nwould find if nature"},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"were running the show, OK?"},"700":{"dur":5,"text":"You do not find cattle-- you\nfind buffalo, but not cattle"},"705":{"dur":1,"text":"on these kinds of plains."},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"You do not find these kinds\nof plants on these plains."},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"You do not find human\nbeings traditionally"},"712":{"dur":1,"text":"on these kinds of\nplains, and you certainly"},"714":{"dur":3,"text":"didn't find horses on\nthe American plains,"},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"being ridden by humans."},"719":{"dur":1,"text":"You want to be\neven more extreme,"},"720":{"dur":2,"text":"just walk into a cornfield."},"723":{"dur":1,"text":"What lives and\ndies in a cornfield"},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"has nothing to do with\nwhat nature would select."},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"It has everything to\ndo with what we want."},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"We don't want birds\neating the seed,"},"731":{"dur":1,"text":"we don't want weeds\neating over here,"},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"we don't want any\nplants that aren't corn."},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"We want corn and we\nwant it for miles"},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"and we want it in orderly rows."},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"That is not natural selection,\nthat is human selection."},"742":{"dur":4,"text":"And our rural landscape\nabsolutely reflects this."},"746":{"dur":3,"text":"So as you go out\nand you look at,"},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"not only what does the\nlandscape look like,"},"751":{"dur":4,"text":"but what grows there, we have\nso thoroughly changed nature"},"756":{"dur":4,"text":"to our purposes that wild\nmustard weed, something"},"760":{"dur":5,"text":"that looks like this, sometimes\nhas its flowers suppressed."},"766":{"dur":4,"text":"When you suppress the flowers of\nmustard weed you get broccoli."},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"Otherwise you\nwouldn't get broccoli."},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"When you have bigger leaves\nin the mustard weed then"},"776":{"dur":4,"text":"you get kale, which you can\nbuy downstairs in your cafe."},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"When you sterilize\nmustard flowers then"},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"you get cauliflower."},"784":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can take\nthis weed and you"},"787":{"dur":3,"text":"can change the genes or the\nphysical characteristics"},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"or the way it\ngrows and evolve it"},"792":{"dur":4,"text":"to suit your purposes, your\nsize, your color, your desire,"},"797":{"dur":1,"text":"your productivity."},"798":{"dur":2,"text":"But that has nothing to\ndo with random selection,"},"800":{"dur":3,"text":"and that has nothing\nto do random mutation."},"803":{"dur":3,"text":"That has to do with our\nbreeding, hybridizing,"},"807":{"dur":3,"text":"guiding what we want\nthese plants to do."},"811":{"dur":2,"text":"And of course we've been\ndoing this with ourselves."},"813":{"dur":3,"text":"We've gone from being\nprimarily a rural species"},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"that traditionally, for over\n90 percent of its history,"},"819":{"dur":4,"text":"lived in groups of about\n150, and separated every time"},"823":{"dur":5,"text":"it got above 150 into these\nlarge urban communities."},"828":{"dur":2,"text":"And what's happened in\nthe last decade or two is,"},"831":{"dur":2,"text":"we've gone from being a\nmajority rural species living"},"834":{"dur":4,"text":"in small towns and villages, to\nbeing a majority urban species."},"839":{"dur":3,"text":"And some of these urban areas\nare getting quite large."},"843":{"dur":2,"text":"To be able to live in\ncommunities like this"},"845":{"dur":3,"text":"you have to change the animal."},"849":{"dur":3,"text":"If you take a wild animal and\nyou change the environment"},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"it can have some rapid\nevolutionary pressure,"},"855":{"dur":3,"text":"and the same thing is\nhappening with human beings."},"858":{"dur":2,"text":"Let me give you a sense of\nhow fast this is happening."},"861":{"dur":4,"text":"So China, in three years,\nused 150 percent more cement"},"866":{"dur":2,"text":"than the US did in a century."},"868":{"dur":1,"text":"China, in the next\ncouple of decades,"},"870":{"dur":3,"text":"is going to build 30 cities that\nare as large as some of the 30"},"873":{"dur":2,"text":"largest cities on the planet."},"876":{"dur":2,"text":"This is an enormous\nprocess of urbanization,"},"878":{"dur":3,"text":"and something similar is\ngoing to happen in India."},"882":{"dur":3,"text":"To domesticate ourselves, to\ndomesticate our pets, what"},"885":{"dur":3,"text":"we have to do is we have\nto take species, animals,"},"888":{"dur":4,"text":"that normally don't live\ntogether, de-wild them, teach"},"893":{"dur":2,"text":"them to live with those\nthat are traditionally not"},"895":{"dur":3,"text":"their friends, and teach\nthem a series of rules."},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"Because if you're going to\nlive in a very tight-knit"},"901":{"dur":3,"text":"environment maybe\nyou can tolerate"},"905":{"dur":3,"text":"a couple of psychopaths\non the Mongolian plain"},"909":{"dur":2,"text":"if you're going out as Genghis\nKhan to conquer the continent"},"911":{"dur":2,"text":"and you've got the whole\ncontinent in front of you."},"913":{"dur":3,"text":"But if you have five psychopaths\nin your 60 story building"},"916":{"dur":2,"text":"in New York or Hong\nKong or London,"},"918":{"dur":3,"text":"that is a very bad thing to do."},"921":{"dur":2,"text":"So what you end up\ndoing is you end up"},"924":{"dur":4,"text":"domesticating not just dogs,\nnot just cats, but also humans."},"928":{"dur":1,"text":"And this process\nof domestication"},"929":{"dur":3,"text":"has been going on\nfor a long time."},"933":{"dur":4,"text":"Those places that did not have\na state, did not have dictators,"},"937":{"dur":3,"text":"did not have kings, were\nincredibly dangerous"},"940":{"dur":1,"text":"places to live in."},"942":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you look at non-state\nsocieties on the top,"},"945":{"dur":3,"text":"your chances of being violently\nkilled throughout your lifetime"},"949":{"dur":3,"text":"were astronomical, even when\ncompared with ancient Mexico,"},"952":{"dur":2,"text":"the first line on the bottom."},"954":{"dur":2,"text":"So you take the Mayas,\nyou take the Aztecs,"},"957":{"dur":2,"text":"you take the Toltecs-- you\ntake all these people who"},"959":{"dur":3,"text":"would sacrifice thousands\nand made the pyramids,"},"962":{"dur":4,"text":"they were still a whole\nlot less violent--"},"966":{"dur":4,"text":"because it was a\nstate-sanctioned violence--"},"971":{"dur":2,"text":"than were societies\nthat were not organized"},"973":{"dur":1,"text":"into states societies."},"975":{"dur":3,"text":"Then by the time you get\nto France the 19th century,"},"979":{"dur":1,"text":"the violence has come down."},"980":{"dur":3,"text":"By the time you get to Western\nEurope, US, and the world"},"983":{"dur":3,"text":"in 2007 at the very bottom."},"986":{"dur":1,"text":"So the world,\ndespite what you're"},"988":{"dur":5,"text":"reading, which is horrendous\nin Congo, in Mexico, in ISIS"},"994":{"dur":4,"text":"and a

1500s,"},"1009":{"dur":3,"text":"what you're going to see is that\nthe entertainment on Saturday"},"1013":{"dur":3,"text":"was to see if you could\ntake somebody and burn
