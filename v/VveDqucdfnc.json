of"},"647":{"dur":1,"text":"difference."},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"One of the biggest differences\nI'd say is just the travel."},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"It's literally the travel."},"653":{"dur":3,"text":"In Europe we only have to travel\nabout an hour to a"},"657":{"dur":3,"text":"game, or two hours at the most.\nWhereas, when we play"},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"East Coast and we're playing in\nNew York, it's a 5, 5 and"},"664":{"dur":0,"text":"1\/2 hour journey."},"665":{"dur":4,"text":"So that's a big difference but\non the field, the level of"},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"play has definitely gone up in\nthe last three or four years."},"673":{"dur":4,"text":"And I think that it's at a stage\nnow where this game is"},"677":{"dur":4,"text":"starting to attract the interest\nof some big names and"},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"big players in Europe."},"684":{"dur":5,"text":"And I think there has to be a\ncertain change with some of"},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"the things that goes on\nthroughout the league."},"691":{"dur":4,"text":"But I think it's a league now,\nwhere European teams, big"},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"European teams, are coming over\nfor their pre-seasons and"},"699":{"dur":1,"text":"they're playing against us."},"700":{"dur":8,"text":"So five years ago, the Galaxy\nhad been heard of but I think"},"709":{"dur":3,"text":"now, with the interest of the\nplayers that have come over,"},"712":{"dur":4,"text":"such as Robbie Keane and\nobviously London Donovan as a"},"717":{"dur":5,"text":"U.S. star, we've had that\ninterest and it's exciting to"},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"MARVIN CHOW: Yeah, I think it\nmust great to see the growth,"},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"see

to continue to play as"},"774":{"dur":3,"text":"long as possible and as\nlong as teams keep"},"777":{"dur":3,"text":"offering me new contracts."},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"MARVIN CHOW: But it seems
