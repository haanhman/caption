what's unique about\nthis when you look at"},"413":{"dur":3,"text":"these interfaces is that most\ngovernment software doesn't"},"417":{"dur":1,"text":"have interfaces like

didn't"},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"understand, soft of right before\ngames broke out to be"},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"really mainstream."},"615":{"dur":5,"text":"And I think that what ties that\nto what I'm doing now is"},"621":{"dur":4,"text":"it was such a transformative\ntime for me to understand what"},"625":{"dur":1,"text":"the technology world was."},"627":{"dur":3,"text":"I had been an American Studies\nmajor in college, and"},"630":{"dur":4,"text":"technology was something I felt\nlike I didn't understand."},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was really the people,\nand the creativity, and the"},"637":{"dur":4,"text":"magic of development that just\ncompletely enraptured me."},"642":{"dur":3,"text":"I had an amazing time."},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"That conference was very small\nwhen we started it, and when I"},"648":{"dur":3,"text":"left it was, I think,\n12,000 people."},"651":{"dur":1,"text":"But it really just gave\nme a love for what"},"653":{"dur":1,"text":"developers can do."},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"And that carried on."},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"Then I left that."},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"After I had my kid I came back\nand was working on Web

needs to"},"697":{"dur":3,"text":"be a creative force, not\njust a stagnant,"},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"So I think that really\ninformed this"},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"idea of Code for

month-to-month."},"756":{"dur":4,"text":"And the first month, we started\nwith three cities,"},"761":{"dur":3,"text":"Boston, DC--"},"764":{"dur":0,"text":"oh, sorry, four."},"765":{"dur":4,"text":"So
