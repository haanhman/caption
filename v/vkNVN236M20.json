today's economy."},"46":{"dur":2,"text":"And we'll have some time\nat the end for questions,"},"48":{"dur":3,"text":"but for now, Ben Parr, you\nnow have our attention."},"52":{"dur":2,"text":"Welcome to Google."},"55":{"dur":2,"text":"BEN PARR: Thank you."},"57":{"dur":2,"text":"But you've all seen \"Up,\" right?"},"59":{"dur":2,"text":"And you've seen Doug."},"62":{"dur":3,"text":"I feel like Doug the\ndog, screaming \"squirrel\""},"65":{"dur":1,"text":"everywhere all the time."},"67":{"dur":3,"text":"And we live in this kind of\nnew era in the last decade"},"71":{"dur":3,"text":"where we are bombarded with\nmore information than ever."},"74":{"dur":1,"text":"And yet, we have the\nsame 24 hours a day."},"76":{"dur":8,"text":"In 1986, we were presented with\napproximately 46 newspapers"},"85":{"dur":2,"text":"worth of information, according\nto one research study."},"87":{"dur":2,"text":"And by 2006, that\nnumber had increased"},"90":{"dur":2,"text":"to 176 newspapers

that\nwith our multitasking"},"103":{"dur":1,"text":"habitats--that's my\nactual TweetDeck."},"105":{"dur":3,"text":"It looks like someone\nvomited on something."},"108":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is the kind\nof thing all of us"},"109":{"dur":1,"text":"are dealing with daily."},"111":{"dur":3,"text":"And our multitasking habit,\nwhich is not actually"},"114":{"dur":1,"text":"helping us all that much."},"115":{"dur":1,"text":"In fact, there's\nanother study that"},"116":{"dur":3,"text":"found that those who consider\nthemselves heavy multimedia"},"120":{"dur":1,"text":"multitaskers are actually\nthe least effective"},"122":{"dur":3,"text":"when it comes to completing\ntasks and switching"},"125":{"dur":2,"text":"between tasks and accuracy."},"127":{"dur":2,"text":"And so you have this combination\nof way more information"},"130":{"dur":3,"text":"than ever and us\nhaving bad habits"},"133":{"dur":1,"text":"to manage that information."},"134":{"dur":2,"text":"And you have a world where it\nis both extremely difficult"},"137":{"dur":2,"text":"to capture attention and to\nstand out with your idea,"},"140":{"dur":3,"text":"whether it's a project, it's\na start up, it's a

kind\nof information,"},"151":{"dur":2,"text":"understanding which things are\nworth our time and attention."},"153":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that's kind of\nthe reason, the impetus,"},"155":{"dur":3,"text":"for why I wrote \"Captivology.\""},"159":{"dur":2,"text":"And \"Captivology\" is about\nthe science and the psychology"},"161":{"dur":2,"text":"of attention, and why we pay\nattention to certain people"},"164":{"dur":2,"text":"and products, and how to\nutilize that science to capture"},"167":{"dur":1,"text":"the attention of others."},"168":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I'm going to talk a\nlittle bit about the research"},"171":{"dur":2,"text":"I did for \"Captivology\"--\nover 1,000 research"},"174":{"dur":2,"text":"studies, interviews\nwith dozens of PhDs,"},"177":{"dur":3,"text":"and everybody from Steven\nSoderbergh, Adrian Grenier,"},"180":{"dur":1,"text":"the people behind the\nOld Spice campaign,"},"182":{"dur":2,"text":"Sheryl Sandberg,\nDavid Copperfield,"},"184":{"dur":1,"text":"people across industries."},"186":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going to talk about the\nthree stages of attention"},"188":{"dur":3,"text":"and my model of attention and,\nmore importantly, what I call"},"192":{"dur":1,"text":"the seven captivation triggers."},"193":{"dur":2,"text":"And these are seven\npsychological triggers"},"196":{"dur":3,"text":"that capture attention\nacross all these stages."},"199":{"dur":3,"text":"And so let me get\ninto attention."},"202":{"dur":3,"text":"And so I kind of describe\nattention as a bonfire."},"206":{"dur":2,"text":"And your goal in\ncapturing attention"},"208":{"dur":3,"text":"is to walk people\nthrough the three stages,"},"211":{"dur":2,"text":"is to grow the fire\nbecause you can't just"},"214":{"dur":1,"text":"start out with a bonfire."},"215":{"dur":1,"text":"You have to start\nwith the spark."},"216":{"dur":1,"text":"And then you go\nthrough the kindling."},"218":{"dur":2,"text":"And then you go and you finally\nget to the logs in the bonfire."},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"And so the first stage\nis immediate attention."},"223":{"dur":1,"text":"The second stage\nis short attention."},"225":{"dur":1,"text":"And the last stage\nis long attention."},"227":{"dur":2,"text":"And let me explain a little\nbit about each stage."},"229":{"dur":1,"text":"Stage one."},"230":{"dur":1,"text":"Immediate attention."},"232":{"dur":2,"text":"It is our immediate\nand automatic reaction"},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"to certain sights,\nsounds, and stimuli."},"236":{"dur":2,"text":"It's how we react if someone\ndoes this, for example."},"238":{"dur":2,"text":"[POP]"},"241":{"dur":3,"text":"I love doing that\nevery single time."},"244":{"dur":2,"text":"It's how we automatically react\nto when there's sights, sounds,"},"247":{"dur":0,"text":"something like that."},"248":{"dur":2,"text":"When someone puts a gunshot,\nor launches a confetti cannon,"},"250":{"dur":1,"text":"we're going to pay attention."},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'm sorry to the\njanitors in a little bit."},"254":{"dur":2,"text":"But the reason why we\nreact is because it's"},"256":{"dur":1,"text":"a defense mechanism."},"257":{"dur":1,"text":"We're trying to\nprotect ourselves."},"259":{"dur":3,"text":"Imagine if you had to\nthink every time a car was"},"263":{"dur":1,"text":"coming at you."},"264":{"dur":1,"text":"We'd be dead human beings."},"266":{"dur":1,"text":"We'd be a dead species."},"267":{"dur":1,"text":"And so it's a\nprotection mechanism."},"268":{"dur":1,"text":"And you'll see that\na lot of attention"},"270":{"dur":1,"text":"is a defense mechanism."},"271":{"dur":3,"text":"And a lot of it is activating\nthose defense mechanisms."},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"The second stage is\nfrom subconscious"},"277":{"dur":4,"text":"automatic attention to\nconscious, directed attention,"},"281":{"dur":2,"text":"is when we start concentrating\non something like a test,"},"284":{"dur":3,"text":"or a speaker, or a dress."},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"That goddamn dress."},"290":{"dur":1,"text":"But it's when we\nactually start focusing."},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"And it is a kind of\nshort-term thing."},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's run by a system\ncalled working memory."},"297":{"dur":2,"text":"And working memory is this\nshort-term memory system"},"300":{"dur":2,"text":"that processes the\nsights and sounds"},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"around us and the other stimuli\nand helps us determine which"},"305":{"dur":1,"text":"things are worth our\ntime and attention"},"307":{"dur":1,"text":"and, more importantly,\nwhich things should"},"309":{"dur":1,"text":"be stored in long-term memory."},"310":{"dur":3,"text":"Which leads us-- well, before\nI tell you-- very complicated"},"314":{"dur":0,"text":"system, by the way."},"315":{"dur":1,"text":"I won't go through\nthe entire process"},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"here, but suffice it to say\nit's a very complicated system"},"319":{"dur":1,"text":"that runs our attention."},"320":{"dur":3,"text":"The final stage of attention is\na stage called long attention."},"324":{"dur":1,"text":"I kind of use Beyonce\nas an example."},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"It's the difference between\nhearing and listening"},"327":{"dur":4,"text":"to a Beyonce song in the\ncar and joining the Beyhive"},"332":{"dur":1,"text":"and becoming a lifelong\nfan and buying albums."},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"It's the reason why when\nBeyonce launched her last album,"},"336":{"dur":1,"text":"she didn't have to\ndo any marketing."},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"She just got to drop it and\nsuddenly everyone bought it."},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"But it's because she earned\nlong attention over time,"},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"building those relationships,\nbuilding that relationship"},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"with her audience, building\nlong attention and interest"},"348":{"dur":1,"text":"from millions of people."},"349":{"dur":1,"text":"And so those three\nkind of things"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"combine to create this\nbonfire of attention."},"354":{"dur":2,"text":"Now how do you build that\nbonfire of attention?"},"357":{"dur":1,"text":"You have to go\nthrough what I call"},"358":{"dur":1,"text":"the seven captivation triggers."},"359":{"dur":1,"text":"And these are seven\npsychological triggers"},"361":{"dur":1,"text":"I discovered over and\nover again that came up"},"363":{"dur":3,"text":"in my research that\ncapture attention"},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"from immediate attention\nto long attention."},"368":{"dur":3,"text":"So let me tell you about the\nfirst one-- automaticity."},"372":{"dur":1,"text":"So pop quiz."},"374":{"dur":1,"text":"If you're a hitchhiker\non the side of the road"},"376":{"dur":2,"text":"and you want to have the best\nchance of being picked up,"},"378":{"dur":1,"text":"what color shirt\nshould you wear?"},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"Guesses?"},"382":{"dur":1,"text":"Red, white, I heard."},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"Orange."},"386":{"dur":0,"text":"I've heard everything."},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"Actually, usually\nsomeone says \"naked.\""},"390":{"dur":1,"text":"You guys aren't dirty enough."},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"It's too early in\nthe day or something?"},"393":{"dur":0,"text":"It's a Monday."},"394":{"dur":0,"text":"Fair enough."},"398":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe during Burning Man."},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"So the answer is actually,\nit's gender specific."},"402":{"dur":3,"text":"If you're a man, on\naverage, any bright color"},"405":{"dur":3,"text":"will do because of\nthe dark backgrounds"},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"of the black roads, and\nthe dark green grass,"},"411":{"dur":1,"text":"and the brown dirt."},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"But if you're a woman,\nand there was actually"},"415":{"dur":2,"text":"a French scientist who was\nlike, I'm going to study this."},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"He wanted to find out who\nwould get picked up the most."},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"So he had women wear six\ndifferent colored shirts."},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"And on average, someone\nwould pull over about 13%"},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"of the time."},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"Unless they were wearing\nthe color red, in which case"},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"they were picked\nup 21% of the time."},"431":{"dur":3,"text":"And the reason for that is\nactually our subconscious"},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"associations that we have\nwith red and romanticism."},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact, another study found if\nyou just put a thick red border"},"440":{"dur":2,"text":"around a person's face, the\nopposite gender, on average,"},"442":{"dur":3,"text":"we'll rate that person\nas more attractive."},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"Reason why there's\na red border there."},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"I also just like having an\nexcuse to put that picture up"},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"every time."},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"But the opposite\ngender will rate"},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"that person as more attractive."},"454":{"dur":1,"text":"And even there was\nanother study that"},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"found that if a researcher\nis wearing a red shirt,"},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"a person who doesn't know will\nactually sit several inches"},"461":{"dur":0,"text":"closer to that person."},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"It's like an automatic\ninvitation to be more intimate."},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"And so immediate attention\nis this automatic response"},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"to different stimuli."},"469":{"dur":3,"text":"And it really comes down\nto two things-- contrast"},"472":{"dur":1,"text":"and association."},"474":{"dur":1,"text":"And contrast is the\ncontrast that something"},"475":{"dur":3,"text":"has with its surroundings, and\nassociation is the subconscious"},"478":{"dur":3,"text":"associations we have with\na certain color, or symbol,"},"482":{"dur":3,"text":"or sound, based on our cultural\nhistory, based on our biology,"},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"based on other factors."},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"And so a key to capturing\nattention with automaticity"},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"is to use the right\ncolor for the job."},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"So example is Amazon."},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a reason why they use\nyellow and orange buttons."},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"They have high contrast\nwith their surroundings,"},"500":{"dur":1,"text":"with white and gray backgrounds."},"501":{"dur":1,"text":"And they perform really well."},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"But most bright colors will\nactually perform very well."},"506":{"dur":5,"text":"However, give me some\nword association game."},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"Give me words you think\nwhen you see this."},"517":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Dutch\" is usually\nthe first thing."},"518":{"dur":1,"text":"Give me more."},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"Anyone else?"},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"Usually someone says \"prison.\""},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"But actually, here's my point."},"526":{"dur":1,"text":"AUDIENCE: White collar prison."},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"BEN PARR: White\ncollar-- there you go."},"529":{"dur":4,"text":"So orange and yellow actually\nhave the lowest correlation"},"533":{"dur":1,"text":"with competence."},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"Teal and blue actually\nhas the highest,"},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"which is why my cover\nhas blue and teal on it."},"538":{"dur":1,"text":"But think about it."},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"If someone like this\nwalked into most offices,"},"542":{"dur":2,"text":"maybe not Google,\nbut most offices,"},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"you'd laugh their\nass out of the room."},"547":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's because of\nthat correlation."},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's all these kind\nof different correlations"},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"we have with different\ncolors and sounds."},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact, let's talk about smell."},"554":{"dur":3,"text":"So this flower, I believe\nthe Camellia flower,"},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"was used by Ralph\nLauren in a perfume,"},"559":{"dur":1,"text":"and it performed really well."},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"So like, let's\nexpand it everywhere."},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're going to take\nit to South America."},"565":{"dur":3,"text":"Problem is in South America,\nthis specific flower"},"568":{"dur":1,"text":"is used in funerals."},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"So when you sprayed it on, you\nliterally smelled like death."},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"How do you think that performed?"},"574":{"dur":3,"text":"Not well is the answer."},"577":{"dur":4,"text":"Trigger number two-- framing."},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"And so framing is\nthat we pay attention"},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"to things that fall within\nour frame of reference"},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"or don't pay attention\nto things because"},"587":{"dur":1,"text":"of our frame of reference."},"588":{"dur":3,"text":"And to describe this, I want\nto talk about deodorant."},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"Anyone want some free deodorant?"},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"Specifically, I want to talk\nabout a teenage entrepreneur"},"599":{"dur":1,"text":"named Edna Murphy."},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"And so in the 1910s,\ndeodorant wasn't a thing."},"603":{"dur":1,"text":"And antiperspirants\nweren't a thing."},"605":{"dur":1,"text":"In fact, this is\nwhat they literally"},"606":{"dur":4,"text":"used to protect themselves--\ncotton pads and dress shields."},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"And there were two reasons why\nantiperspirants and deodorants"},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"weren't a popular\nthing back then."},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"First reason was\nthat people thought"},"616":{"dur":4,"text":"it was going to kill you to use\none, to have antiperspirants."},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was going to kill you."},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"But the bigger and second\nreason was because it was not"},"625":{"dur":1,"text":"a thing you talked about."},"627":{"dur":3,"text":"Bodily fluids, sweat, any\nof that sort of thing,"},"630":{"dur":0,"text":"it wasn't ladylike."},"631":{"dur":4,"text":"It was not a thing you talked\nabout in proper conversation."},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"And so Edna Murphy, teenage\nentrepreneur, her father,"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"a surgeon, invented an\nantiperspirant for his hands"},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"because he wanted to not\nsweat doing surgeries."},"644":{"dur":3,"text":"And she's like, you know, I\ncould put those in my armpits."},"648":{"dur":1,"text":"So she does."},"649":{"dur":3,"text":"And she gets a $500 loan\nfrom her grandfather"},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"and she creates Odo-Ro-No."},"655":{"dur":0,"text":"Greatest name ever."},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact, I found one."},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't think they\nmake these anymore."},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"Odo-Ro-No."},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"So she goes out and\nshe starts selling"},"664":{"dur":1,"text":"and she gets a little\nbit of traction."},"665":{"dur":1,"text":"But she's finding\nit very difficult"},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"to get the product\nabove that plateau"},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"because of the two reasons\nI just told you about."},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"Now she had to get past it."},"674":{"dur":1,"text":"So what she did\nwas she teamed up"},"675":{"dur":2,"text":"with a guy named James Webb\nYoung who would eventually"},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"become the first chairman\nof the Ad Council."},"680":{"dur":1,"text":"And together they\ndecided they had"},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"to go in and tackle these\nframes of reference,"},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"these perceptions people had."},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"First, how do you\nget people to realize"},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"it will not kill you\nto wear antiperspirant."},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, it was\ninvented by a doctor."},"691":{"dur":1,"text":"And so they really\nadvertised that fact hard."},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is actually one of\nthe original advertisements."},"695":{"dur":1,"text":"And you'll see,\nOdo-Ro-No being used"},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"and recommend by leading\nphysicians skin specialists."},"699":{"dur":1,"text":"That helped double\nsales, when we"},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"started advertising that fact."},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"But they still had\nthe bigger issue"},"704":{"dur":3,"text":"of how do you get people\nto actually talk about it?"},"707":{"dur":4,"text":"And so they put out this ad."},"711":{"dur":4,"text":"Now this ad talks very\nfrankly about body orders."},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"It says, \"a frank discussion of\na subject too often avoided.\""},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"And it talks about body odor and\nhow you don't have to have it."},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"And how you can use\nOdo-Ro-No to fix it."},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"By the way, this was in\nthe most popular magazine"},"725":{"dur":1,"text":"of the era, of 1919."},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"Does anyone want to guess\nwhich magazine that is?"},"732":{"dur":0,"text":"What?"},"733":{"dur":0,"text":"Anyone else want to try?"},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going to take some out\nto dinner if they guess this."},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"No one's ever guessed this."},"739":{"dur":0,"text":"No."},"740":{"dur":4,"text":"Answer is \"Ladies Home Journal.\""},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"And so this was put in\n\"Ladies Home Journal.\""},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"And when it was put in\n\"Ladies Home Journal,\""},"749":{"dur":4,"text":"it was actually one of the most\ncontroversial things if 1919."},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"Hundreds of women canceled\ntheir \"Ladies Home Journal\""},"755":{"dur":3,"text":"subscriptions in\nprotest of this ad."},"759":{"dur":1,"text":"The ad changed people's\nframe of reference."},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"They started actually\ntalking about deodorants."},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"And suddenly it was OK to\ntalk about antiperspirants."},"766":{"dur":1,"text":"And sales went through the roof."},"768":{"dur":1,"text":"And a few years\nlater, Edna Murphy"},"769":{"dur":2,"text":"was able to sell her\ncompany for millions."},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"And so what she did was she\nadapted her audience's frame"},"775":{"dur":1,"text":"of reference."},"776":{"dur":2,"text":"And she helped re-frame\nthe conversation."},"778":{"dur":3,"text":"And Odo-Ro-No did this\nby adapting to the fact"},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"that people were worried\nabout health concerns"},"784":{"dur":2,"text":"so they brought in the fact\nthat a doctor invented it."},"787":{"dur":1,"text":"And they re-framed\nthe conversation"},"788":{"dur":1,"text":"by making it OK to discuss."},"790":{"dur":1,"text":"And so frames of\nreference and framing"},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"is this incredible power in\nwhich we can pay attention"},"794":{"dur":2,"text":"to certain things and not\nothers based on our backgrounds"},"796":{"dur":0,"text":"and worldview."},"797":{"dur":3,"text":"It's the reason why if you\ntalk about climate change"},"801":{"dur":3,"text":"or you talk about\nvaccines, one group"},"804":{"dur":1,"text":"is going to have a\nvery different reaction"},"806":{"dur":1,"text":"than another."},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"And in a funny way, it\ndoes make sense sometimes"},"809":{"dur":3,"text":"because if someone comes\nto us and is telling us"},"813":{"dur":3,"text":"how the earth is flat, why the\nfuck should we listen to them?"},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"It makes sense, but\nthen sometimes we"},"819":{"dur":3,"text":"get into this kind of rut\nwhere we miss important things."},"822":{"dur":3,"text":"There are a couple ways to\ncreate frames of reference"},"825":{"dur":1,"text":"and to change\nframe of reference."},"827":{"dur":1,"text":"One big one is scarcity."},"829":{"dur":3,"text":"So who likes Twinkies here?"},"833":{"dur":1,"text":"Oh, thank God."},"834":{"dur":1,"text":"No one."},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"But Twinkies, as you\nprobably may remember,"},"838":{"dur":1,"text":"a few years ago, the\ncompany that owned them,"},"840":{"dur":1,"text":"Hostess, went bankrupt, right?"},"841":{"dur":3,"text":"And suddenly, millions of\npeople went to the stores"},"844":{"dur":1,"text":"to grab these things."},"846":{"dur":3,"text":"And it was not for the reason\nthat they tasted any better."},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"They still tasted like shit."},"851":{"dur":1,"text":"But suddenly, they\nbecame very popular."},"853":{"dur":1,"text":"And the reason,\nactually, the science"},"854":{"dur":2,"text":"shows that we assign\nhigher value to things"},"857":{"dur":1,"text":"that we feel

so you"},"2699":{"dur":1,"text":"could define the nose."},"2701":{"dur":3,"text":"Now it was impossible to\ndo hair in 16 by 16 pixels."},"2704":{"dur":1,"text":"So we're going to\ngive him a red

a\nlot of framing research"},"2781":{"dur":0,"text":"to think about that one."},"2782":{"dur":2,"text":"Because there's a couple\nthings that go about it."},"2784":{"dur":1,"text":"It's really a\nframing issue, right?"},"2786":{"dur":5,"text":"It's elevating the\nimportance of that knowledge"},"2792":{"dur":2,"text":"to a level where people will be\nforced to pay attention, right?"},"2794":{"dur":1,"text":"Because there's\na whole-- there's"},"2796":{"dur":3,"text":"a segment of the population\nthat absolutely and thank"},"2799":{"dur":2,"text":"God believes that

hearing"},"2815":{"dur":1,"text":"a different side of the story."},"2817":{"dur":2,"text":"Now there's a couple different\nways to kind of go about it."},"2819":{"dur":2,"text":"You can find a way to

have to find a\nway to get actually"},"2827":{"dur":2,"text":"them to agree on a little thing\nand that actually opens up"},"2830":{"dur":1,"text":"the door lot more."},"2831":{"dur":1,"text":"You get them to agree\non the smallest thing"},"2833":{"dur":2,"text":"and that will make them\nmore receptive to an idea."},"2835":{"dur":0,"text":"There's a couple other things."},"2836":{"dur":1,"text":"One interesting\nthing I learned is"},"2837":{"dur":1,"text":"the illusion of truth effect."},"2839":{"dur":2,"text":"And this might not necessarily\nhelp you get attention for it,"},"2841":{"dur":1,"text":"but it'll help\nyou understand why"},"2842":{"dur":1,"text":"people believe what they do."},"2844":{"dur":3,"text":"And it is purely that the\nmore you repeat a phrase,"},"2847":{"dur":2,"text":"the more likely people\nwill believe it is true."},"2850":{"dur":1,"text":"And they did a study\nwhere they would"},"2852":{"dur":5,"text":"have people go through like\n30 or 40 phrases every couple"},"2858":{"dur":2,"text":"weeks and they would\nrate how true they were."},"2860":{"dur":3,"text":"And every time they\nwent through it,"},"2863":{"dur":2,"text":"they would rate the statements\nthat they saw over and over"},"2866":{"dur":2,"text":"again as more true,\ndespite the fact"},"2868":{"dur":1,"text":"that repeating a\nstatement does not"},"2870":{"dur":2,"text":"make a thing more or less true."},"2872":{"dur":2,"text":"But it actually has that\nkind of profound effect"},"2874":{"dur":1,"text":"in our brains and our minds."},"2876":{"dur":2,"text":"And so when it comes\nto getting attention"},"2878":{"dur":1,"text":"for that sort of\nthing, it's going"},"2880":{"dur":1,"text":"through those three stages."},"2881":{"dur":1,"text":"It's how do you get\npeople to pay attention"},"2883":{"dur":1,"text":"to it in the first place?"},"2884":{"dur":2,"text":"If they don't know anything\nabout it,

think about anti\nsmoking campaigns."},"2893":{"dur":2,"text":"In Thailand, they\nhad a campaign where"},"2896":{"dur":2,"text":"they had little kids with\ncigarettes in their

Thailand but all across"},"2912":{"dur":1,"text":"because it violated\npeople's expectations,"},"2913":{"dur":2,"text":"and it really drove\nthe point home."},"2916":{"dur":1,"text":"But then, it kind

group."},"2922":{"dur":2,"text":"There's one group that just\nwill not believe what you say."},"2925":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's going to\nrequire different tactics"},"2927":{"dur":2,"text":"and you have to really think\nabout the framing trigger."},"2929":{"dur":2,"text":"And you have this audience\nthat thinks it's important"},"2931":{"dur":2,"text":"but maybe they're not\nbeing active enough."},"2933":{"dur":1,"text":"And they know that\nthere's sort of a problem,"},"2935":{"dur":1,"text":"but they don't think\nof it strong enough."},"2937":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think that maybe have\nto violate their expectations"},"2939":{"dur":2,"text":"and jolt them out of their\ncomplacency and be like, here"},"2942":{"dur":1,"text":"is what is effing happening."},"2944":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'm not sure what\nthat kind of thing"},"2945":{"dur":2,"text":"is but you need to jolt them\nout of their expectations."},"2948":{"dur":1,"text":"I would love to\ntalk about that one"},"2950":{"dur":2,"text":"further because that's a\nhard problem that I still"},"2952":{"dur":3,"text":"haven't fully figured out\nhow we solve that
