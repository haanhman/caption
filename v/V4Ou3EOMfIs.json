back."},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yeah, there are\nsigns that it is."},"464":{"dur":4,"text":"There's more and more activity\nin the west in oil country."},"469":{"dur":3,"text":"The amount of oil

million would be nice,"},"486":{"dur":3,"text":"but that would be tough\non the infrastructure."},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're running ahead,"},"492":{"dur":4,"text":"and the price of oil is\nthe

the\nDakota Access Pipeline."},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"Our oil is more valuable."},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"- But again, there's\nthe sales tax,"},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"real question mark\nthere because sales tax"},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"was collected on new rigs\ncoming into North Dakota."},"535":{"dur":3,"text":"A lot of rigs were here,\nthey were just parked here,"},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"and there's some thought\nthat maybe the new"},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"Revenue Forecasting\nCommittee may have to take"},"543":{"dur":4,"text":"another look and maybe treat\nsales tax a little differently."},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"- Yes,"},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"the industry has changed"},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"because of the\ncollapse of oil prices,"},"558":{"dur":4,"text":"and they are more\nefficient, excuse me."},"562":{"dur":4,"text":"They are able to do more with\nless and when there is less,"},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"there is less for\nthe state to tax."},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"So the revenue from each\nnew well, for example"},"573":{"dur":4,"text":"is down from what it was at\nthe height of the oil boom."},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"- Making up for that\nthough is the fact that"},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"it seems to be growing,\nespecially out in the west."},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"There seems to be a\nlot more job openings"},"584":{"dur":4,"text":"and we might see more ramping\nup of the oil industry."},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"- Right, that's what\nit's looking like,"},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"but one doesn't want to get\ntoo far ahead of their skis,"},"595":{"dur":4,"text":"but keep in mind that\nduring the original oil boom"},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"from four years ago or so,"},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"there was a lot of\ninfrastructure that\nhad to be built,"},"605":{"dur":3,"text":"and that infrastructure\nalso generated tax dollars"},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"for the state."},"611":{"dur":3,"text":"If this

there."},"619":{"dur":4,"text":"So there won't be that\ndouble hit of oil workers"},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"and then all the infrastructure\nthat's being built."},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"- So basically, we're\nprepared for it this time?"},"629":{"dur":1,"text":"- I think we are."},"631":{"dur":1,"text":"I think we're in a much\nbetter position for it,"},"632":{"dur":3,"text":"but that was one of\nthe reasons why we had"},"636":{"dur":4,"text":"such a large increase in\nspending over the past few years"},"640":{"dur":4,"text":"and the spending was one-time."},"644":{"dur":3,"text":"You build a medical\nschool, you built it."},"647":{"dur":3,"text":"You build roads around\nwhat Watford City,"},"651":{"dur":1,"text":"they're built."},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"- But there was the\ninitial upfront costs"},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"and these things are\ngonna last for years?"},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"- Right, and we paid\ncash for all of it."},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"- That's been

Right, we haven't bonded\nfor a number of years."},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"Our bondage and (mumbles), as\nfar as the state is concerned"},"683":{"dur":3,"text":"has dropped down because we\njust haven't been bonding."},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"We have capacity to do it,"},"689":{"dur":3,"text":"but there's a reluctance\nto go into debt."},"692":{"dur":3,"text":"So we are not, at this\nstage in the session,"},"696":{"dur":4,"text":"we don't have general fund\nbuildings that are being put up."},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"As you mentioned, there\nare some dormitories,"},"704":{"dur":3,"text":"some buildings on\ncampuses where the money"},"707":{"dur":3,"text":"is donated or is going to\nbe raised by the campus."},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"So we do have some of that,"},"713":{"dur":3,"text":"but we

the fact that"},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"college is changing,"},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"students are utilizing\ndistance learning"},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"versus sitting in\na classroom
