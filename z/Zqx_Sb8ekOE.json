off."},"307":{"dur":1,"text":"We've all been there."},"308":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm sure that you've been there."},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"It's about being self-aware."},"313":{"dur":3,"text":"Being self-aware about:\nWhat you know,"},"317":{"dur":2,"text":"What you don't know, and\nWhere you want to go."},"319":{"dur":4,"text":"That's the first stage, is really, \"What is\nyour awareness?"},"324":{"dur":1,"text":"What is going on?\""},"325":{"dur":3,"text":"And sometimes, we just happen to know that."},"328":{"dur":1,"text":"We're good at it."},"329":{"dur":1,"text":"We're in tune with it."},"330":{"dur":4,"text":"We've got what some people call sensory acuity,\nsensory awareness."},"335":{"dur":4,"text":"Others, we need to actually specifically set\ndown or certain

there's times that I'm not self-aware\nabout other things that maybe I need to do"},"354":{"dur":3,"text":"around the house and that type of thing."},"357":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I need to consciously

it."},"366":{"dur":5,"text":"So, when we then do that, we not only become\naware of our surroundings and what we do and"},"372":{"dur":5,"text":"don't know, we also start to focus on building\nour ability."},"377":{"dur":6,"text":"The next stage is that when I become aware,\nI now have the ability to say, \"Let me build"},"383":{"dur":6,"text":"the core knowledge, the core skills, the core\ntactics, the core understanding that exists"},"390":{"dur":5,"text":"to allow me, to start to elevate, to start\nto escalate, to start to accelerate the things"},"396":{"dur":1,"text":"that I'm doing.\""},"397":{"dur":5,"text":"So, start with awareness then I look at maybe\nsome gaps in:"},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"My skillset,\nMy strengths,"},"404":{"dur":2,"text":"My knowledge,\nMy

this next stage."},"425":{"dur":1,"text":"Stage 3, which is really about the Application."},"427":{"dur":1,"text":"This is about taking action."},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"This is about doing the stuff."},"431":{"dur":5,"text":"This is about getting out there and actually\nmaking it happen."},"436":{"dur":5,"text":"Many of times, I'm going to these\ufffdto training\nprograms and seminars and

notes\nand they're taking pictures and they're buying"},"450":{"dur":3,"text":"stuff but they never go out and do anything\nwith it."},"454":{"dur":3,"text":"At some point, at some point, if we want

point, we got to go do something."},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"> We got to go take action."},"466":{"dur":5,"text":"But, what happens is and I talked about this\nin the last episode is, we get this, The Perfectionist"},"471":{"dur":1,"text":"Syndrome."},"472":{"dur":4,"text":"And that perfectionist syndrome is a paradox\nbecause on one side is perfection, on the"},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"other side is procrastination."},"479":{"dur":4,"text":"And the reality is that, well I just need\nto know a little bit more."},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was guilty of it at one point of

class,\nthen they'll take me seriously."},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"I just need one more and then they'll do it."},"514":{"dur":1,"text":"And then I'll do it and then I'll do

the end result."},"538":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's what the process is."},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"And many times we're afraid to make a choice,\nwe're afraid to make a decision because

it doesn't set a direction until you have\na bunch of decisions along a line."},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"It only set a point."},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"It sets a point where we can stand there

caused me to make the choices?"},"794":{"dur":1,"text":"How do I make sure it doesn't happen again?"},"796":{"dur":1,"text":"It's the only way to grow."},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"So, we need to be accountable for our outcomes."},"800":{"dur":2,"text":"We need to be accountable for our actions."},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"And take responsibility for that."},"805":{"dur":5,"text":"When we do, we can

anywhere."},"861":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's not going to serve us in the long\nrun."},"864":{"dur":1,"text":"We can go through our grieving process."},"865":{"dur":4,"text":"We can go through our

\"What's the"},"891":{"dur":1,"text":"new decisions that I need to make?\""},"893":{"dur":1,"text":"Take responsibility and move on."},"895":{"dur":2,"text":"So, that next stage is
