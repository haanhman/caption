But\nwe need to think about the whole system when"},"422":{"dur":6,"text":"we talk about koalas, but importantly, and\nmy focus and my contribution, is a drug for"},"428":{"dur":5,"text":"koala chlamydia. As I said, it\u2019s a very\nsevere disease. Here is a koala eye, and you"},"434":{"dur":4,"text":"can see just how inflamed and damaged that\neye is; that koala\u2019s actually blind.

This koala\nhas chronic incontinence from those chlamydial"},"450":{"dur":11,"text":"cysts all throughout the koala\u2019s urogenital\ntract. So we need a drug that\u2019s more effective"},"462":{"dur":12,"text":"to treat the koala chlamydia. Sorry \u2013 I\u2019ll\njust have another drink. So why is that tricky?"},"474":{"dur":4,"text":"We\u2019ve got lots of antibiotics, we all take\nthem throughout our life. Antibiotics for"},"478":{"dur":6,"text":"koalas are very, very tricky because the koala\nlives on gum leaves.

The koalas have\nan amazing way to metabolise drugs, because"},"531":{"dur":5,"text":"of those toxins that it\u2019s exposed to in\nits diet. So most drugs are metabolised much"},"536":{"dur":5,"text":"more quickly by koalas than most other animals,\nand because of the complexity of degrading"},"541":{"dur":4,"text":"those leaves, they actually have a two metre\nlong secum with a really complicated microbiome"},"546":{"dur":5,"text":"or mix of organisms that degrade those leaves.\nAnd we need to preserve that. If we treat"},"552":{"dur":5,"text":"them orally with a classic antibiotic, that\nmicrobiome can die and then the koala can"},"558":{"dur":5,"text":"effectively starve.

It\u2019s a long treatment regime,"},"569":{"dur":5,"text":"it doesn\u2019t always work, but it\u2019s the only\nmechanism we have. Unfortunately there\u2019s"},"575":{"dur":5,"text":"one company that makes that drug. The site\ncoincidentally that that was made at has been"},"580":{"dur":5,"text":"shut down. We have a very limited supply of\nthat drug left in Australia \u2013 a number of"},"586":{"dur":5,"text":"years. We haven\u2019t found an effective alternative\nyet. So that\u2019s where my research comes in."},"591":{"dur":5,"text":"We set out to use some of our human research\non a drug compound to develop a koala drug."},"597":{"dur":6,"text":"In order to do that, we had to establish koala\nchlamydial islet from clinical koalas, and"},"603":{"dur":8,"text":"here, again, in the red and green, the green\nis the chlamydia over time, growing in cells"},"612":{"dur":4,"text":"at different time points, and there is an\nocular islet and urogenital clinical islets"},"616":{"dur":5,"text":"from diseased koalas. So we established a\nmechanism to grow these islets and look at"},"621":{"dur":4,"text":"them. Then we took a drug that had come out\nof our human research, or a lead compound,"},"626":{"dur":3,"text":"and we tested it against these islets. And\nwhat you can see now is at different times"},"630":{"dur":4,"text":"when we add different doses the green inclusion\ndisappears. We call it an inclusion. The green"},"634":{"dur":5,"text":"sack of chlamydia disappears from the cell,\nand we can statistically graph that over time."},"640":{"dur":6,"text":"So our human compound looks like it works\nin cell models to kill the koala. That was"},"646":{"dur":4,"text":"on two islets. We then got a whole collection\nof clinical islets from Port Macquarie \u2013 the"},"650":{"dur":4,"text":"PMS, from southeast Queensland and from Lone\nPine from a captive animal, and we looked"},"655":{"dur":5,"text":"at ocular islets and urogenital islets and\ndosed them over time with our drug. Now this"},"660":{"dur":4,"text":"is log scales \u2013 these graphs are actually\nfor every drop, you\u2019re actually seeing one"},"665":{"dur":4,"text":"in 100 to one in 1000 to one in 10,000 drops,\nso this is actually more substantial than"},"669":{"dur":5,"text":"it looks because it\u2019s log scale. And so\nour drug works really well to quite well on"},"674":{"dur":4,"text":"a whole range of clinical koala islets. So\nthis is the first time this many islets have"},"679":{"dur":5,"text":"been tested with any drug, in fact. And then\nwe went to the real innovation: we needed"},"684":{"dur":7,"text":"to prove that this worked in koala cells.\nAll the work around the world on koala chlamydia"},"692":{"dur":5,"text":"has been done using a mouse cell model. So\nin conjunction with a whole consortium of"},"697":{"dur":8,"text":"people, we isolated koala cells from animals\nthat were having to be euthanised due to disease."},"705":{"dur":3,"text":"One of them was a dog attack and one of them\nhad chlamydia.

We isolated the cells\nfrom these animals, from their conjunctiva,"},"718":{"dur":4,"text":"from their uterine tract, and for \u2013 in a\nworld first, we were able to grow those cells"},"723":{"dur":5,"text":"in the lab. This is the cells from Natalie,\nnot Natalia \u2013 Natalie\u2019s uterus \u2013 over"},"729":{"dur":4,"text":"time.

We saw no impact"},"756":{"dur":4,"text":"on the proliferation, and we didn\u2019t see\nany toxicity on the conjunctival epithelial"},"760":{"dur":5,"text":"cells, and these were done in triplicate in\ndifferent tissue islets for the same two animals."},"766":{"dur":4,"text":"In conjunction to that, animals that were\nbeing vaccinated for the koala vaccine, which"},"771":{"dur":3,"text":"was many, many more \u2013 we were able to take\nadditional blood cells from those animals"},"775":{"dur":5,"text":"and in a much larger sample size of animals,\nwe didn\u2019t see any toxicity on blood cells."},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"So we\u2019re getting there with the development\nof this drug. It looks like it\u2019s not toxic,"},"783":{"dur":4,"text":"or at least very low levels of toxicity that\nwill need improvement, and it\u2019s quite effective"},"788":{"dur":3,"text":"in reducing the burden of koala in the cells,\nso it is quite an effective antibiotic, in"},"791":{"dur":8,"text":"both a lab model but also importantly in real\nkoala tissue. And the final punch line is"},"799":{"dur":4,"text":"that we were able to re-infect that koala\ntissue \u2013 that primary, lab-cultured koala"},"804":{"dur":4,"text":"tissue with chlamydia and prove in the dark\ngrey there that our compound was able to reduce"},"808":{"dur":6,"text":"the infection. So it works in koalas grown\nin their natural cells."},"815":{"dur":3,"text":"So that was very exciting, but we recognise\nthat we need to do further medicinal chemistry"},"819":{"dur":3,"text":"\u2013 so further drug development to make this\ninto a drug that we can actually do clinical"},"822":{"dur":8,"text":"trials with infected, diseased koalas. This\nis a series of experiments that we did on"},"830":{"dur":3,"text":"conjunction with those medicinal chemists\nthat I mentioned at the start. So what I\u2019m"},"834":{"dur":4,"text":"going to tell you about, if you look at this\nmolecule in the middle, that complicated sort"},"839":{"dur":3,"text":"of two-ring structure on the side, that\u2019s\nthe mechanism of activity \u2013 that\u2019s the"},"842":{"dur":6,"text":"kind of unique chemistry that this particular\nmolecule targets.

And just to reassure"},"869":{"dur":5,"text":"you that the specificity is real, by modifying\nany of those three internal sites, we basically"},"874":{"dur":4,"text":"completely drop out the activity \u2013 so it\nis very specific, the activity.
