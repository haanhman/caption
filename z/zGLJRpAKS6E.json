what"},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"we want in any organization."},"404":{"dur":2,"text":"We need some kind of order."},"406":{"dur":3,"text":"And if I look at the city\naround us, we're in New

right?"},"435":{"dur":1,"text":"It just worked."},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"So we ended up with\nemergent order--"},"440":{"dur":3,"text":"the kind of order that\nis not imposed top

individuals with\nthe freedom to act"},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"within that framework of rules."},"454":{"dur":3,"text":"We see this every day\nin our modern society."},"457":{"dur":1,"text":"Yet when we go\ninto a company, we"},"459":{"dur":1,"text":"see something very different."},"461":{"dur":1,"text":"We see a very different\nway of achieving order."},"463":{"dur":3,"text":"It's an attempt to\ncentrally plan and control"},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"and achieve an order by imposing\none as opposed to putting"},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"in place the right\nframework of

what makes sense."},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"And the structure\noften gets in the way."},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think that's why when\nwe talk about structure"},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"in companies, there's\na lot of people"},"493":{"dur":3,"text":"that have an allergic reaction\nto the idea of structure."},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"They associate it\nwith

around\nNew York, I don't"},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"experience the structure of\nthe rules of the game at play"},"509":{"dur":1,"text":"as limiting me."},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"It's actually enabling

like?"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, the first thing\nthat Holacracy does"},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"is introduce a\nframework of rules"},"535":{"dur":1,"text":"just like we have in societies."},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's captured\nin a constitution."},"539":{"dur":3,"text":"So once a company tastes\nHolacracy, they experience it,"},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"they get a sense of it, and they\ndecide they want to do this."},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"They want to move\nforward with it."},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"The first move is for the\nCEO or department head"},"550":{"dur":4,"text":"or whoever's adopting this\nto sign a declaration ceding"},"555":{"dur":4,"text":"their power into\nthis constitution,"},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"saying I am no\nlonger above the law,"},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"but I'm subject to the same\nrules that everyone else is."},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"And here's a framework\nthat we'll all"},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"be bound by as we go about\ndoing our work together"},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"in this organization."},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a pretty big shift."},"573":{"dur":4,"text":"Can you imagine a CEO you know\nor a significant department"},"578":{"dur":3,"text":"manager or something like that\nsigning a declaration saying"},"581":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm ceding my authority to\njust do whatever I want and run"},"584":{"dur":3,"text":"things as the boss into a\nframework of rules like this?"},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a cool shift."},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"And this constitution\nyou can actually"},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"find it on GitHub\nfor those of you"},"593":{"dur":1,"text":"from a technical background."},"595":{"dur":1,"text":"It's an open source document."},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a fundamental\nrules of the game."},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"I like to think of\nHolacracy like a new sport."},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"And these are the\nrules of this sport."},"603":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's a framework\nthat tells us"},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"all how we can act and\ninteract and expect"},"608":{"dur":3,"text":"things of each other and\nchange things in the company."},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"So let's look at some of the key\nshifts that this set of rules"},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"introduces."},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"And the first one is any of you\nhave a static job description?"},"619":{"dur":3,"text":"Like something that hasn't been\nupdated in at least months,"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"if not years that\nmaybe is out of date--"},"625":{"dur":1,"text":"that probably was out\nof date by the time"},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"it rolled off the printer?"},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"When was the last time you\nran to your jobs description"},"632":{"dur":3,"text":"to figure out what you\nshould be focused on today?"},"635":{"dur":0,"text":"Right?"},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"Anyone?"},"638":{"dur":1,"text":"No, didn't think so."},"639":{"dur":0,"text":"Right?"},"640":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's because they're\npretty much useless."},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"I should say they're\nuseful for some things."},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"We write them so that we\ncan post a job, great."},"648":{"dur":1,"text":"But really, how\nmuch clarity does"},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"a typical job description\noffer for our day-to-day work?"},"653":{"dur":0,"text":"Really, nothing."},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"They are bureaucratic artifacts."},"656":{"dur":3,"text":"Holacracy replaces those with\na new type of structure--"},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"a new way of describing the\nwork-- the roles at play."},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"And they're dynamically updated."},"665":{"dur":3,"text":"So with Holacracy instead of\nhaving one job description,"},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"you might fill 20\ndifferent roles."},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"And you might fill 20 roles\nin lots of different teams"},"673":{"dur":1,"text":"all across the company."},"675":{"dur":3,"text":"It doesn't just have to be one\nplace in this siloed structure."},"678":{"dur":1,"text":"So you might fill lots\nof different roles."},"680":{"dur":1,"text":"And each one is a\nlittle chunk of work."},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"It's one discrete function."},"685":{"dur":3,"text":"And the way of describing these\nroles is much more grounded."},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"So it has real clarity."},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"And companies running\nwith holocracy-- people"},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"do go and reference their\njob descriptions-- their role"},"694":{"dur":3,"text":"descriptions regularly because\nthey have really good clarity"},"697":{"dur":3,"text":"that's the result of the\nteam's collective learning."},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"And the reason is because\nthey're updated regularly"},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"by the people doing the work."},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's a process--\nit's called governance."},"708":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll talk about it in\na few minutes where"},"710":{"dur":2,"text":"each team gets together\nand they learn together"},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"and they capture that learning\nand distill down what do we"},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"need to be doing differently?"},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"Who needs to be focused on what?"},"719":{"dur":1,"text":"And we capture that\nlearning in these roles."},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"So they're living,\nbreathing, entities."},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"And they have\nmeaningful clarity."},"725":{"dur":0,"text":"That's one difference."},"726":{"dur":1,"text":"Here's another."},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"In most companies, you've\ngot a manager who delegates"},"730":{"dur":1,"text":"some authority to you."},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"Rarely is that really clear."},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"Rarely do you know exactly\nwhat your authority is."},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"More often than not, it's kind\nof like you have the authority"},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"to do whatever you're doing\nas long as the manager thinks"},"742":{"dur":1,"text":"it's generally the\nright thing to do."},"744":{"dur":1,"text":"And as soon as they\ndon't, they'll get in"},"746":{"dur":1,"text":"and they'll tell you that."},"747":{"dur":3,"text":"And then you better\nalign with what they say."},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"With Holacracy, instead of this\nkind of delegated authority"},"753":{"dur":3,"text":"that can be pulled back or\nmicromanaged at any point,"},"757":{"dur":2,"text":"it's truly a distributed\nauthority paradigm."},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"So according to the constitution\nand the fundamental rules"},"762":{"dur":4,"text":"of this game, when you have a\nrole that we created together"},"766":{"dur":1,"text":"through this\ngovernance process, you"},"768":{"dur":2,"text":"have the autonomy\nand the authority"},"771":{"dur":3,"text":"to do anything that makes sense\nto you to get the job done--"},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"to get the job of that\nrole done unless there's"},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"an explicit rule against it."},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"So instead of needing\npermission to act and to make"},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"sure your manager is\nhappy all the time,"},"784":{"dur":1,"text":"you've got autonomy\nand authority"},"786":{"dur":3,"text":"to go lead your role however\nit makes sense to you."},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"And when we discover that\nthere's a constraint we need,"},"792":{"dur":4,"text":"we will create that minimally\nsufficient just in time."},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"So instead of needing\npermission to act first,"},"798":{"dur":2,"text":"you have a blanket grant to do\nwhatever makes sense to you."},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"And as we learn together,\nwe'll start adding constraints"},"803":{"dur":1,"text":"just when we need them."},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"And there's no manager to\nundelegate that authority."},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"So in a company like mine,\nwe run with Holocracy."},"811":{"dur":2,"text":"Everyone has a real\nautonomy and authority."},"814":{"dur":1,"text":"Everyone can make\ndifferent decisions"},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"and everyone knows what that\nis and what the boundaries are."},"819":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's a lot like living\nin a society, right?"},"822":{"dur":3,"text":"I know I can do whatever I\nwant in my house, my property."},"825":{"dur":1,"text":"But if I want to go\ntake my neighbor's car,"},"827":{"dur":1,"text":"I should probably\nget his permission."},"829":{"dur":2,"text":"That's his territory--\nhis property."},"831":{"dur":1,"text":"Holacracy does the same."},"832":{"dur":3,"text":"It makes clear what's\nmine to lead and control."},"836":{"dur":1,"text":"And I don't need\nanyone's permission."},"837":{"dur":0,"text":"It's mine."},"838":{"dur":0,"text":"It's my territory."},"839":{"dur":1,"text":"I can do whatever I want."},"840":{"dur":1,"text":"And it makes clear\nwhere my neighbors"},"842":{"dur":2,"text":"are-- where the boundaries\nare and what we can"},"844":{"dur":1,"text":"expect from each other as well."},"845":{"dur":2,"text":"Because when we have a\nautonomy in an organization,"},"847":{"dur":3,"text":"it's got to come with\na responsibility."},"850":{"dur":1,"text":"So here's another shift."},"852":{"dur":3,"text":"What this does when we have\nconstantly updating roles"},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"with real authority\nis instead of"},"857":{"dur":2,"text":"these large-scale\nre-organizations--"},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"every few years and somebody\ncomes in and changes"},"861":{"dur":1,"text":"the whole structure."},"863":{"dur":3,"text":"Instead, we're doing\nmicro-reorganizations"},"866":{"dur":2,"text":"constantly in every team."},"869":{"dur":3,"text":"So we are rapidly iterating on\nour organizational structure."},"873":{"dur":2,"text":"And this isn't done at\nthe top and handed down."},"875":{"dur":1,"text":"This is done in every team."},"876":{"dur":2,"text":"Every team has a governance\nprocess that they go through."},"879":{"dur":1,"text":"It might be twice a month."},"881":{"dur":2,"text":"In a more mature\norganization with Holacracy,"},"883":{"dur":2,"text":"it might be once a month\nor every other

the time."},"2080":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's actually why\nmany executives and CEOs"},"2083":{"dur":1,"text":"make the switch\nafter they try it"},"2085":{"dur":1,"text":"even just for a couple of days."},"2087":{"dur":3,"text":"Through the different processes,\nHolacracy shows up and adds."},"2090":{"dur":2,"text":"And at the end of that, they\nhave a direct

the\nmetric that I like to."},"2185":{"dur":2,"text":"Is it easier or\nharder to drive change"},"2187":{"dur":4,"text":"and to get tensions\naddressed in the system,"},"2191":{"dur":2,"text":"AUDIENCE: Hey, Brian, thanks\nfor coming and explaining."},"2193":{"dur":3,"text":"It really is interesting."},"2196":{"dur":3,"text":"So I understand the\nstructure

to-- this\nidea of land grabbing"},"2215":{"dur":1,"text":"is always the term, right?"},"2216":{"dur":1,"text":"And you get these people\nthat are operating"},"2218":{"dur":2,"text":"in that respect

you need to."},"2471":{"dur":3,"text":"Another example-- the governance\nmeetings although they often"},"2475":{"dur":3,"text":"are dealing with micro stuff\nbecause often the micro

objections,"},"2509":{"dur":2,"text":"we pulled up to the\nkind of 50,000 foot view"},"2511":{"dur":3,"text":"and looked at what is the circle\ndoing that really matters?"},"2514":{"dur":1,"text":"And why does the\ncircle feel weird?"},"2515":{"dur":1,"text":"And what can we do\nwith those functions?"},"2517":{"dur":2,"text":"And, ultimately, we\nrestructured our whole

really cool to see that\nkind of dynamic reorganization"},"2530":{"dur":3,"text":"happening regularly in\ncompanies instead of it's static"},"2533":{"dur":1,"text":"and its stuck in\nwhat they're doing."},"2535":{"dur":5,"text":"And it is often the big,\nstrategic solution almost,"},"2541":{"dur":1,"text":"but one tension at a time."},"2543":{"dur":2,"text":"And for me, this is the\nreally interesting thing"},"2545":{"dur":3,"text":"is it's like imagine a company\nis a ball of yarn of tensions."},"2549":{"dur":2,"text":"Every thread is a tension."},"2551":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's all woven together."},"2553":{"dur":1,"text":"The temptation in\na lot of companies"},"2555":{"dur":2,"text":"is to look at the ball\nof yarn, pull back"},"2557":{"dur":1,"text":"to get really

the puzzle-- not the only\npiece, but a huge piece here,"},"2639":{"dur":1,"text":"is purpose."},"2640":{"dur":2,"text":"So Holacracy is a\npurpose-driven system,"},"2643":{"dur":2,"text":"which means the whole thing\nwe're organizing around"},"2645":{"dur":1,"text":"is what is the ultimate\npurpose of the company."},"2647":{"dur":2,"text":"And how are we going to\nexpress it in the

system."},"2654":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's one of the alignment\nfunctions in Holacracy"},"2658":{"dur":3,"text":"is it's all about aligning\naround purpose as opposed"},"2661":{"dur":2,"text":"to

paycheck."},"2693":{"dur":2,"text":"But this is cool work."},"2695":{"dur":3,"text":"But I see at least a shift\ntowards that when companies"},"2699":{"dur":3,"text":"shift to have really

do it,"},"2708":{"dur":2,"text":"you get a different kind of\nmotivational force, which often"},"2711":{"dur":4,"text":"then has pay and other concerns\nlike that less of a

Holacracy"},"2743":{"dur":1,"text":"like a new operating system."},"2744":{"dur":2,"text":"It isn't a full,\ncomplete package"},"2747":{"dur":2,"text":"with all the apps you\nneed in your

built-in one,"},"2755":{"dur":1,"text":"I download other apps."},"2757":{"dur":3,"text":"Holacracy does not tell\nyou how to do compensation."},"2760":{"dur":1,"text":"But you need an app to do that."},"2762":{"dur":1,"text":"So there are many approaches."},"2763":{"dur":1,"text":"And every company\nthat uses Holacracy"},"2765":{"dur":1,"text":"could do that a\nlittle different."},"2766":{"dur":2,"text":"They might install a different\napp for compensation."},"2769":{"dur":2,"text":"And the same with a number\nof other business

completely"},"2778":{"dur":3,"text":"dodging the question, let\nme give you a common answer."},"2781":{"dur":3,"text":"Here's one app that's\nactually fairly common now."},"2785":{"dur":0,"text":"My company uses it."},"2786":{"dur":2,"text":"Zappos is moving to\nsomething like it too."},"2789":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's a badge-based\ncompensation app"},"2792":{"dur":3,"text":"where badges represent\nskills you've demonstrated"},"2795":{"dur":2,"text":"to your peers that you have."},"2797":{"dur":1,"text":"So you can earn badges\nin different skills."},"2799":{"dur":1,"text":"There's a

recognized."},"2805":{"dur":2,"text":"And anyone can initiate that."},"2808":{"dur":2,"text":"And then anyone who's earned\nthe same set about badges"},"2810":{"dur":1,"text":"will get paid the

if you get this set\nplus these two more,"},"2818":{"dur":1,"text":"then your pay is\ngoing to be this."},"2820":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you think there's a set\nof badges that doesn't show up"},"2822":{"dur":1,"text":"there and should have\na different pay level,"},"2824":{"dur":1,"text":"you can propose it\nand say, you know,"},"2826":{"dur":2,"text":"these badges are worth this much\nand these are worth that much,"},"2829":{"dur":2,"text":"then I think my set of badges\nhere should be worth this much."},"2831":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's a process\nto evaluate that and get"},"2833":{"dur":1,"text":"it put in place."},"2834":{"dur":1,"text":"So what you end\nup with is instead"},"2836":{"dur":3,"text":"of one linear climb\nacross a ladder"},"2839":{"dur":2,"text":"and pay is by management,\ngrade or whatever,"},"2842":{"dur":2,"text":"you end up with a\nvery dynamic system"},"2844":{"dur":3,"text":"where you can grow and\ndevelop in any number of ways"},"2847":{"dur":1,"text":"by developing\ndifferent skills that"},"2849":{"dur":1,"text":"are useful to the organization."},"2850":{"dur":2,"text":"And based on the skills you've\ndemonstrated to your peers"},"2853":{"dur":2,"text":"that you are using\nclearly and have,"},"2856":{"dur":3,"text":"that will drive your pay in a\nvery peer-to-peer

to go somewhere else?"},"2880":{"dur":1,"text":"Or you need to fill new\nroles in your circle."},"2881":{"dur":1,"text":"And you need to get\npeople from somewhere."},"2883":{"dur":0,"text":"How does that happen?"},"2884":{"dur":1,"text":"BRIAN ROBERTSON: Yeah, think\nof it like a marketplace."},"2885":{"dur":1,"text":"You got your buyers and sellers."},"2887":{"dur":3,"text":"And you need to connect them\nand find the right transactions."},"2890":{"dur":2,"text":"So we talk about the\nrole marketplace,"},"2893":{"dur":3,"text":"which is all these roles,\neven in a small company."},"2896":{"dur":2,"text":"20 people-- you might\nhave hundreds of roles"},"2898":{"dur":1,"text":"that need to get filled."},"2899":{"dur":2,"text":"And there are new ones\nshowing up constantly."},"2901":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's an\ninternal marketplace"},"2904":{"dur":3,"text":"that develops of, hey, we've\ngot a new role in this circle."},"2907":{"dur":0,"text":"Here's what it is."},"2908":{"dur":2,"text":"And somebody's pitching to try\nto find someone to fill it."},"2910":{"dur":2,"text":"And you get some candidates that\nare looking for new roles that"},"2912":{"dur":1,"text":"are not completely booked."},"2913":{"dur":2,"text":"Or they just want something new\nand creative add to their mix."},"2916":{"dur":1,"text":"And so they're shopping around."},"2918":{"dur":1,"text":"And they find this role."},"2919":{"dur":1,"text":"And then there's, of\ncourse, still a need"},"2920":{"dur":1,"text":"to make sure they're\nthe right fit."},"2922":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's another role that\nis assigning people to roles"},"2924":{"dur":2,"text":"and making sure they're the\nright fit for those roles."},"2926":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's going\nto the market maker"},"2928":{"dur":2,"text":"that's bring them together."},"2930":{"dur":1,"text":"And lots of different\ncompanies will then"},"2932":{"dur":1,"text":"do things to make that easier."},"2933":{"dur":4,"text":"Zappos use-- we have a\nsoftware app that supports"},"2938":{"dur":1,"text":"companies using Holacracy."},"2940":{"dur":2,"text":"They're using the API to\nbuild a whole role marketplace"},"2942":{"dur":3,"text":"app as an extension of that\nbecause they have 1,500 people"},"2946":{"dur":1,"text":"and lots of roles."},"2947":{"dur":1,"text":"So they're making\nit easier for people"},"2948":{"dur":3,"text":"to search and tag roles and\nfind the right fits for

great."},"2965":{"dur":1,"text":"It's transparent."},"2966":{"dur":2,"text":"It gives people the power."},"2968":{"dur":3,"text":"In case of crisis, it's not\nlike the South Park episode"},"2972":{"dur":2,"text":"where every bigger\nleader keeps walking in"},"2974":{"dur":1,"text":"and keeps changing the process."},"2976":{"dur":2,"text":"And no one really knows\nwhat the problem is."},"2978":{"dur":4,"text":"And the problem, actually,\nthe solver who knows it"},"2982":{"dur":3,"text":"is very deep down into the\nhierarchy without any power."},"2985":{"dur":3,"text":"That's apparently the problem\nthat Holacracy seems to solve."},"2989":{"dur":2,"text":"But as an organization\nthat already"},"2991":{"dur":5,"text":"has its own structure\nand its own hierarchy"},"2996":{"dur":2,"text":"built into it-- and the\npeople have worked hard"},"2998":{"dur":5,"text":"to get high up there--\nhow do you start injecting"},"3004":{"dur":3,"text":"such things easily and\nnot like in a big bang"},"3007":{"dur":3,"text":"that people don't forget\nthe growing pain that much?"},"3011":{"dur":2,"text":"BRIAN

hierarchy"},"3026":{"dur":2,"text":"to something like this without\ngoing through some challenge"},"3028":{"dur":1,"text":"along the way."},"3029":{"dur":1,"text":"That said, we have\nfound some things that"},"3031":{"dur":1,"text":"might help minimize it some."},"3033":{"dur":3,"text":"And one for larger organizations\nis pilot it somewhere."},"3036":{"dur":2,"text":"Don't just try to go over\nwhole organization all at"},"3038":{"dur":0,"text":"once all upfront."},"3039":{"dur":2,"text":"That's hugely painful."},"3042":{"dur":4,"text":"Find a department, division,\nteam, subsidiarr-- something"},"3046":{"dur":4,"text":"that has enough insulation from\nthe broader corporate system"},"3050":{"dur":2,"text":"to say we're going to do things\ndifferently on this

people."},"3058":{"dur":1,"text":"And they piloted\nit there and got"},"3060":{"dur":1,"text":"built in internal\nexpertise, which helped them"},"3062":{"dur":1,"text":"with their broader rollout."},"3063":{"dur":0,"text":"So they did that."},"3064":{"dur":1,"text":"That's one technique."},"3066":{"dur":1,"text":"Another is there's lots\nof ways to support it"},"3067":{"dur":2,"text":"with the right support,\ncoaching, training."},"3070":{"dur":2,"text":"Think of it like\nlearning a new sport."},"3072":{"dur":3,"text":"You could try to learn a\nnew

rule\nbook and trying to play."},"3081":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's going to\nbe really awkward."},"3082":{"dur":3,"text":"Or you can get out on the field\npeople who have played before"},"3086":{"dur":2,"text":"and a coach and not worry\nabout the rules too much."},"3088":{"dur":1,"text":"You'll learn those\nas you play, right."},"3090":{"dur":2,"text":"And then get some\non-the-field instruction."},"3092":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's going to be a\nmuch easier way to learn."},"3095":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's another piece of that."},"3097":{"dur":1,"text":"And finally, there\nare certainly a lot"},"3099":{"dur":1,"text":"of things you can\ntake out of this."},"3100":{"dur":1,"text":"There's a whole chapter\nin the book that's"},"3102":{"dur":3,"text":"really just if I can't do\nthis whole thing, what can I"},"3105":{"dur":0,"text":"pull out of it?"},"3106":{"dur":2,"text":"What little techniques\ncan I use in my

company\nthan part of Holacracy"},"3116":{"dur":1,"text":"in all of the company."},"3117":{"dur":2,"text":"And what I mean by that is\nthink of it like playing a game."},"3120":{"dur":2,"text":"You're not really playing\nsoccer if you adopt one rule."},"3122":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you want to be a\nWorld Cup soccer player,"},"3125":{"dur":3,"text":"you don't get there by mastering\none rule at a

work."},"3446":{"dur":1,"text":"But it happens more\noften in companies"},"3448":{"dur":1,"text":"with a lot of transparency."},"3450":{"dur":3,"text":"And the second is you still\nneed somebody whose

essentially"},"3463":{"dur":1,"text":"a manager then in that role."},"3465":{"dur":0,"text":"BRIAN ROBERTSON: The\ninteresting thing"},"3466":{"dur":2,"text":"is they have no authority to\ntell the

questions."},"3518":{"dur":3,"text":"The first one is how do you\ndeal with existing organizations"},"3522":{"dur":2,"text":"where they are used to\nmanaging with authority."},"3524":{"dur":2,"text":"They are used to their power\nstruggles and horse trading"},"3527":{"dur":0,"text":"and all that stuff."},"3528":{"dur":1,"text":"How do you switch them over?"},"3529":{"dur":3,"text":"BRIAN ROBERTSON: Yeah, with\na lot of effort and coaching."},"3533":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not easy."},"3534":{"dur":2,"text":"AUDIENCE: What would be,\nI guess, the motivation?"},"3536":{"dur":1,"text":"BRIAN ROBERTSON: The\nmotivation to change?"},"3538":{"dur":3,"text":"Usually, it's somebody at the\ntop that starts having a vision"},"3541":{"dur":3,"text":"and seeing that this management\nhierarchy is limiting"},"3545":{"dur":2,"text":"our flexibility--\nour responsiveness."},"3547":{"dur":4,"text":"Or they like Tony at Zappos\nsaid, I know as we grow,"},"3551":{"dur":1,"text":"bureaucracy sets in."},"3553":{"dur":2,"text":"And I want to grow more like\na city, more innovation, more"},"3555":{"dur":0,"text":"entrepreneuralism."},"3556":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's usually somebody\nstarting to sense the limits."},"3559":{"dur":1,"text":"If you don't have\nanyone experiencing"},"3561":{"dur":2,"text":"any tension about the\ncurrent structure,"},"3563":{"dur":2,"text":"it's really difficult to find\nanyone that wants to change it."},"3566":{"dur":1,"text":"But when you find\nsomeone that sees"},"3568":{"dur":2,"text":"the potential for something\ndifferent, than Holacracy"},"3570":{"dur":2,"text":"gives a tool for, OK,\nhere's something different,"},"3573":{"dur":1,"text":"you can just do."},"3574":{"dur":1,"text":"And then there's\nthe coaching process"},"3576":{"dur":2,"text":"of shifting managers\nfrom being managers"},"3579":{"dur":3,"text":"to being very different\nentrepreneurs, shifting"},"3582":{"dur":2,"text":"other people that are used to\nlooking to managers to make"},"3585":{"dur":2,"text":"decisions and kind of\nhiding in the hierarchy"},"3587":{"dur":1,"text":"to step out and\nown their autonomy"},"3589":{"dur":1,"text":"and own their authority."},"3590":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a lot of coaching\nthat goes into all that."},"3592":{"dur":1,"text":"AUDIENCE: And my\nsecond question is"},"3593":{"dur":2,"text":"about how do you deal\nwith low performers that"},"3596":{"dur":3,"text":"decide to come out with a little\ncircle that does basically very"},"3599":{"dur":0,"text":"little?"},"3600":{"dur":2,"text":"BRIAN ROBERTSON: Yeah,\nthe first line of defense"},"3602":{"dur":4,"text":"is simply transparency when it's\nobvious to everyone around them"},"3606":{"dur":2,"text":"that that guy's not\nperforming, that"},"3608":{"dur":2,"text":"creates a lot of peer pressure."},"3611":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's not the only answer."},"3612":{"dur":1,"text":"It's just the ideal answer."},"3614":{"dur":1,"text":"And I see this at\nplay in companies"},"3616":{"dur":3,"text":"when somebody's poor\nperformance is blindingly"},"3619":{"dur":2,"text":"obvious to everyone,\nthe person tends"},"3622":{"dur":3,"text":"to opt out of a poor-performing\nrole pretty quickly."},"3625":{"dur":1,"text":"When that doesn't\nhappen, you still"},"3627":{"dur":2,"text":"need somebody else that's making\nsure you have the right people"},"3629":{"dur":0,"text":"in the right roles."},"3630":{"dur":2,"text":"And Holacracy has a\nspecial role in each circle"},"3632":{"dur":2,"text":"whose job it is to get the\nright people in the right roles."},"3635":{"dur":1,"text":"And when somebody's\nnot performing"},"3636":{"dur":1,"text":"and they need to\nmake a change, they"},"3638":{"dur":1,"text":"have the authority to do that."},"3640":{"dur":1,"text":"Now that person can't\ntell you what to do."},"3641":{"dur":1,"text":"They can't tell you\nhow to do your role,"},"3643":{"dur":2,"text":"but they can find the right\npeople to give the autonomy to"},"3646":{"dur":0,"text":"in the role."},"3647":{"dur":2,"text":"So there is still a\nfunction of that as well."},"3649":{"dur":1,"text":"AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Tonya."},"3650":{"dur":1,"text":"I have so many questions."},"3652":{"dur":2,"text":"But a follow up\nquestion on that."},"3654":{"dur":4,"text":"So is there ever an issue with\nhaving more like in group,"},"3658":{"dur":1,"text":"out group issues?"},"3660":{"dur":2,"text":"The way that we deal with\npoor performers at Google"},"3662":{"dur":1,"text":"So if you're a poor\nperformer, your teammates"},"3664":{"dur":0,"text":"don't know about that."},"3665":{"dur":2,"text":"That's a private conversation\nyou have with your manager."},"3668":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not like everyone at a\nmeetings is like you suck."},"3670":{"dur":1,"text":"We're all talking about you."},"3671":{"dur":2,"text":"So I can just see if\nthere's a system which"},"3673":{"dur":5,"text":"requires like large-- the\nlarger-- people in masses"},"3679":{"dur":2,"text":"behaving negatively\ntowards an individual"},"3681":{"dur":2,"text":"because they don't like how\nthat individual is performing,"},"3684":{"dur":3,"text":"can't that set things up for\nthe larger issues rather than"},"3687":{"dur":2,"text":"more private\nconversations one on one?"},"3689":{"dur":0,"text":"BRIAN ROBERTSON: Yeah."},"3690":{"dur":1,"text":"I think there would\nbe a terrible idea."},"3691":{"dur":1,"text":"But that's not how\nHolacracy does it."},"3693":{"dur":2,"text":"So it provides\nmore transparency,"},"3695":{"dur":1,"text":"which makes it more obvious."},"3696":{"dur":2,"text":"But that doesn't mean we\nhave discussions about it."},"3699":{"dur":2,"text":"It's just more transparency\nof who's doing what."},"3701":{"dur":1,"text":"What are they getting\nthat every day?"},"3702":{"dur":1,"text":"That's just more transparent."},"3704":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's not about\nhaving discussions."},"3707":{"dur":2,"text":"As a group, this guy sucks."},"3709":{"dur":3,"text":"It's more about for that person\nfeeling like, oh, my god."},"3712":{"dur":1,"text":"My performance is being watched."},"3713":{"dur":0,"text":"Everyone can see it."},"3714":{"dur":1,"text":"We don't need to have a\ndiscussion when you know"},"3716":{"dur":1,"text":"that you just have visibility."},"3717":{"dur":1,"text":"You can't hide\nsomewhere anymore."},"3719":{"dur":2,"text":"Everything you do is transparent\nfor everyone else to see."},"3722":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's the first sign."},"3723":{"dur":2,"text":"You still do have one-on-one\nprivate conversations"},"3725":{"dur":1,"text":"when somebody needs to\nget removed from a role."},"3727":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's that special role\nI mentioned in each circle."},"3730":{"dur":1,"text":"That person's not\ngoing to call a meeting"},"3731":{"dur":1,"text":"about that with a group."},"3732":{"dur":2,"text":"They're going to go talk\nto the person and say, hey,"},"3734":{"dur":1,"text":"I think we got you\nin the wrong role."},"3736":{"dur":1,"text":"But firing someone\nfrom a role is not"},"3737":{"dur":1,"text":"the same as firing\nthem from a company"},"3739":{"dur":2,"text":"when they fill 20 other roles,\nmaybe a different teams."},"3742":{"dur":2,"text":"So I've been fired\nfrom a role and thanked"},"3744":{"dur":1,"text":"the person firing\nme because I knew"},"3746":{"dur":1,"text":"the role was a terrible fit."},"3747":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was just holding the line\nuntil we could get somebody"},"3749":{"dur":0,"text":"better in it."},"3750":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's great."},"3751":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's not a\npublic conversation"},"3753":{"dur":1,"text":"about performance at all."},"3754":{"dur":2,"text":"It's still a very one-on-one\nwhen that needs to happen."},"3757":{"dur":2,"text":"AUDIENCE: So it sounds\nlike while there may not"},"3759":{"dur":1,"text":"be official\nmanagers, there still"},"3761":{"dur":2,"text":"are people that can make\na call on whether or not"},"3763":{"dur":1,"text":"someone should be in a role?"},"3765":{"dur":0,"text":"So think of it this way."},"3766":{"dur":2,"text":"The functions that you typically\nassociate with a manager"},"3768":{"dur":2,"text":"get distributed out\ninto different roles"},"3771":{"dur":1,"text":"and different processes."},"3772":{"dur":3,"text":"So there is still a role that\ncan decide who's in which role"},"3775":{"dur":1,"text":"and make changes."},"3777":{"dur":2,"text":"But that person can't set\nyour comp-- can't fire you."},"3780":{"dur":2,"text":"And they can remove you\nfrom that one role, sure."},"3782":{"dur":1,"text":"They can't tell you what to do."},"3783":{"dur":2,"text":"They have no authority to\nsay, hey, I want you to do x."},"3786":{"dur":2,"text":"Or you're responsible for y."},"3788":{"dur":1,"text":"That happens through\nother processes."},"3790":{"dur":1,"text":"All they're doing\nis looking at here"},"3792":{"dur":2,"text":"is the role we've\ndefined in governance."},"3794":{"dur":1,"text":"Who's the right fit for it?"},"3795":{"dur":1,"text":"They get the right fit in."},"3796":{"dur":2,"text":"And then that person has\nautonomy until they jump in"},"3799":{"dur":1,"text":"and need to make a change."},"3800":{"dur":2,"text":"So, yes, you still have\nthe functions of a manager."},"3803":{"dur":2,"text":"They just get broken out\nand distributed differently"},"3805":{"dur":2,"text":"and not centralized all in one\nperson with fuzzy boundaries."},"3808":{"dur":1,"text":"And they can tell you\nwhat to do and everything"},"3810":{"dur":1,"text":"else all at once."},"3811":{"dur":1,"text":"AUDIENCE: My question\nis how-- so it"},"3813":{"dur":2,"text":"seems to me like--\ncorrect me if I'm"},"3815":{"dur":2,"text":"wrong-- that people that\nhave a certain skill"},"3817":{"dur":2,"text":"set take on these\nparticular roles."},"3820":{"dur":3,"text":"So my question is how do\nyou develop and grow people"},"3824":{"dur":2,"text":"into other roles\nor into other areas"},"3826":{"dur":1,"text":"that they want to go into?"},"3828":{"dur":0,"text":"BRIAN ROBERTSON: Yeah."},"3829":{"dur":1,"text":"So the first line\nof defense there"},"3830":{"dur":1,"text":"is it's everyone's\nresponsibility"},"3832":{"dur":1,"text":"to deal with their own growth."},"3834":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's what many companies\nrely largely on that."},"3836":{"dur":1,"text":"Some go further and\nsay, and we want"},"3838":{"dur":1,"text":"to develop cool\ninternal training"},"3839":{"dur":2,"text":"programs to make it easier\nfor people to do that."},"3842":{"dur":2,"text":"But the first ownership\nrests with the person."},"3844":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you want to grow\nand develop in new areas."},"3846":{"dur":2,"text":"Go shop around in\nthe role marketplace."},"3849":{"dur":3,"text":"It's what we mean by there's\na space hundreds of roles"},"3852":{"dur":1,"text":"around the company."},"3853":{"dur":0,"text":"Shop around."},"3854":{"dur":2,"text":"Go find which ones\nexcite you and that you"},"3856":{"dur":1,"text":"might be able to start filling."},"3858":{"dur":2,"text":"And see if you can find one\nthat's maybe 5% of your time,"},"3861":{"dur":2,"text":"but in a new area that forces\nyou to stretch and grow"},"3863":{"dur":1,"text":"and develop in that way."},"3864":{"dur":2,"text":"And then take advantage of\nwhatever training programs"},"3867":{"dur":1,"text":"or whatever else\nyou can find or get."},"3868":{"dur":2,"text":"And so it's a much more\norganic growth path."},"3871":{"dur":2,"text":"Instead of you grow\nby climbing the rungs"},"3874":{"dur":2,"text":"on the hierarchical\nladder, it's more what"},"3876":{"dur":1,"text":"skills do you want to build?"},"3878":{"dur":1,"text":"Go find ways to\nuse those skills."},"3880":{"dur":1,"text":"Go develop in lots\nof different ways."},"3881":{"dur":2,"text":"Whatever makes sense to you."},"3883":{"dur":2,"text":"AUDIENCE: Hey, I\nreally appreciate"},"3886":{"dur":2,"text":"a lot of the philosophy\nbehind a lot of this."},"3888":{"dur":3,"text":"I actually think at Google\nwe do a pretty decent job"},"3891":{"dur":2,"text":"at some of the\nprinciples you recommend."},"3893":{"dur":1,"text":"Of course, we're not perfect."},"3894":{"dur":2,"text":"And we don't take it\nquite to
