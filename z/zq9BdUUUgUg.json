symbols."},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"First reason is preservation."},"545":{"dur":4,"text":"Symbols can withstand\nthe test of time."},"550":{"dur":4,"text":"Symbols transcend\nnormal human

far different than just"},"589":{"dur":4,"text":"plain didactically writing it."},"594":{"dur":7,"text":"So preservation, emotion,\nand the third is orientation."},"601":{"dur":4,"text":"I mentioned last week that\nout of the 404 verses that"},"605":{"dur":3,"text":"comprise the Book of\nRevelation, almost 300 of them"},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"hearken back to an Old\nTestament reference."},"612":{"dur":4,"text":"And so with the symbols that we\nread about, most of the symbols"},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"are rooted in the Old Testament."},"619":{"dur":3,"text":"That is why they might\nsound weird to us,"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"but to a first\ncentury Jewish reader"},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"familiar with the Jewish\napocalyptic literature"},"628":{"dur":3,"text":"like Daniel

protection."},"640":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't know if\nyou're aware of this,"},"642":{"dur":4,"text":"but the early church was under\nthe watchful eye of the Roman"},"646":{"dur":4,"text":"government,

scriptures."},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"And they would try to say,\nlook, subversion, sedition,"},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, can you imagine\na Roman soldier"},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"finding a copy of the\nBook of Revelation?"},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"He'd look at it and go, what?"},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"This just is all weird, all\nthese signs and symbols."},"668":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't get this."},"670":{"dur":5,"text":"And it would be confusing to\nthem and thus for protection."},"676":{"dur":3,"text":"So all of those reasons help\nus understand why the book
