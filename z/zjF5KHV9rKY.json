wants to run,"},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"we need even a bigger spring."},"415":{"dur":3,"text":"So these are lightweight,\nthese are springy,"},"418":{"dur":4,"text":"these are expensive, these\nare

performance enhancing."},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"But then after a lot of media,"},"444":{"dur":1,"text":"after some legal action,"},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"he was allowed to run,\nand he actually did

about"},"530":{"dur":2,"text":"the timeline that\nI went through."},"532":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'm gonna show\nyou some devices."},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"So we're gonna click over\nto some videos for a minute."},"538":{"dur":3,"text":"So the first one I'm gonna\nshow you doesn't have sound,"},"541":{"dur":3,"text":"but I wanna show\nyou the running."},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"Did anyone see this\nin

the heat that he--"},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"it was his last heat I believe."},"621":{"dur":3,"text":"But prior to this,\nhe did exceptionally well."},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"So, you know, a lot\nof good camaraderie"},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"with the other runners\ncongratulating him."},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"I think we're seeing athletes\nwho are wearing devices"},"631":{"dur":3,"text":"becoming more and\nmore mainstream."},"636":{"dur":4,"text":"So, where's it gonna go?"},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"I can assure you\nin four more years,"},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"they're gonna be even faster."},"645":{"dur":3,"text":"So stay tuned for some\ninteresting debates."},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"Show you a little bit more\non the devices themselves"},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"and how they're made."},"659":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is a prosthesis for\none who has an amputation"},"663":{"dur":3,"text":"between their knee and\nthe top of their hip."},"666":{"dur":3,"text":"So this top part is made"},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"completely custom\nfor the individual."},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"Think about the\ncrown on your tooth"},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"if you've ever had\ndental work done."},"676":{"dur":3,"text":"So it has to fit precisely\non what's left of your tooth."},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"So this top part of the\nprosthetic has to fit precisely"},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"on

some\nbeautiful hydraulic technology"},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"underneath to smooth\nout your gait."},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"So this part is custom-made,\nand what's happening now--"},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"in the earlier\ndays of my career,"},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"we took molds of patients' legs"},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"using plaster or other methods,"},"715":{"dur":3,"text":"and then these were handmade."},"718":{"dur":4,"text":"Just a little bit before my\ntime, these were made of wood."},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"And now these are made\nof composite materials"},"725":{"dur":3,"text":"that are carbon,\nand Kevlar, and a lot"},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"of very, very lightweight\nbut strong materials."},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, the interesting thing is,\nwhere's the industry going?"},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"So, throughout\nmost of my career,"},"737":{"dur":3,"text":"this required significant\nexpertise to fit."},"741":{"dur":3,"text":"And if you weren't experienced,"},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"you weren't well-educated,\nyou didn't put your time in,"},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"if this didn't fit well,\nyour patient"},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"would not be successful,\nbut where are we today?"},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"Today, these are done with\ncomputers and digital imaging."},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"So we now take what looks--"},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"a tool which looks like\nthe Starship Enterprise"},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"and we wave it in front of the\npatient's body part that's left,"},"766":{"dur":3,"text":"and it creates a 3D rendering\non our computer of the patient."},"769":{"dur":3,"text":"So no more plaster,\nno more hand-making these."},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"Then they get\nported into the lab"},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"where the socket gets made,\nand clearly you guys have heard"},"778":{"dur":3,"text":"of the 3D printing\nspace, correct?"},"781":{"dur":3,"text":"So to a certain extent,"},"784":{"dur":2,"text":"where's this going?"},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"So in the hands\nof a skilled prosthetist,"},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"is it gonna end up\nby way of Google,"},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"by way of Amazon,\nby way of 3D printing?"},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"So stay tuned as\nthe industry evolves."},"798":{"dur":1,"text":"Costs will come down,"},"799":{"dur":3,"text":"quality will continue to go up."},"803":{"dur":3,"text":"There is an expertise\nthat is highly refined"},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"to get that to happen."},"809":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think there's\na long way to go still"},"812":{"dur":3,"text":"before the two,\ntechnology and the expertise,"},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"really come together."},"818":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, these components\nfrom here down,"},"822":{"dur":3,"text":"these are more produced\nnot individually."},"826":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is a knee,\nwhich comes from a company"},"829":{"dur":4,"text":"out of California, and it\nhas a hydraulic cylinder,"},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"and upon fitting, the resistance\nin the hydraulic cylinder"},"836":{"dur":3,"text":"is tuned to match the\npatient's resistance."},"839":{"dur":2,"text":"Much like--have you ever\ntried to close a door"},"842":{"dur":1,"text":"that has a hydraulic\ncloser on it?"},"844":{"dur":2,"text":"And sometimes the more you push,\nthe harder it pushes back."},"847":{"dur":2,"text":"But now imagine if you could\ncontrol that with a

what's the angle\nof the knee."},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"So, all that gets fed\ninto a small computer"},"861":{"dur":2,"text":"which controls the orifice\ninside the hydraulics,"},"864":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's what makes\nthese things come together."},"867":{"dur":1,"text":"So, just a quick explanation,\nand then of course,"},"869":{"dur":2,"text":"the foot, you know,\nwe've talked about."},"871":{"dur":3,"text":"So, you know, this one's"},"875":{"dur":2,"text":"an all-carbon braid material"},"877":{"dur":3,"text":"that has a specific lamination\nand spring density to it"},"880":{"dur":3,"text":"to help smooth out\nhow an individual walks."},"888":{"dur":4,"text":"Let me flip the coin to\na different story for a minute."},"895":{"dur":3,"text":"So that first part\nwas about people"},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"who are missing a limb."},"901":{"dur":2,"text":"Now I'm gonna show you some\nthings for people who have limbs"},"904":{"dur":2,"text":"but otherwise have\ndifficulty using it."},"907":{"dur":3,"text":"For example, to me,\nif a patient has had a stroke"},"911":{"dur":2,"text":"or perhaps a spinal cord\ninjury, and they--"},"914":{"dur":2,"text":"or brachial plexus injury,\nand they have an arm"},"916":{"dur":3,"text":"but they otherwise can't\nuse it, isn't that the same"},"919":{"dur":3,"text":"as having an amputation\nto a certain extent?"},"923":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you have your arm\nbut you can't use it,"},"926":{"dur":4,"text":"it's almost the same\nneeds as a
