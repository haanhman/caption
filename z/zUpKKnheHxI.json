that's a simple fact."},"84":{"dur":5,"text":"The question is, how do you\n  view the long-term outlook?"},"90":{"dur":4,"text":"And I encouraged the Legislature\nall along to not

regard to how\nproperty taxes operate."},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"- In terms of property\n tax reform then,"},"539":{"dur":3,"text":"how are taxpayers going to\n   notice it, do you think,"},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"when they get their\n  property tax bills?"},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"- Well, there's\n   two sides to this."},"548":{"dur":5,"text":"First is property tax relief,\n which means that they will see"},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"on their tax statement\n that a portion"},"555":{"dur":5,"text":"of their property taxes,\n  12%, is actually discounted."},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"Then they should also notice\n  that the amount of tax"},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"that they have to pay to\n  their local school district"},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"is probably about a\n  third of what it was"},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"just a few years ago."},"571":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's continuing, that\n  doesn't happen all at once,"},"575":{"dur":4,"text":"but we have now an overall\n   cap on the amount of taxes"},"579":{"dur":3,"text":"that you have to pay\nto the school district."},"583":{"dur":4,"text":"And finally, when it comes to\n reform, I think they will see"},"588":{"dur":4,"text":"that all of the\n spending categories\n are now very succinct."},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"They're very clean, and\nthey can be compared"},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"to other political subdivisions."},"598":{"dur":4,"text":"So when you look at your\n  city's general fund revenue,"},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"or their general fund mill\n  levy, you can compare that,"},"606":{"dur":4,"text":"apples to apples, with\nthe city down the road,"},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"and it will make sense."},"612":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think that's a very\n   important breakthrough"},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"in the transparency\n  of property taxes,"},"618":{"dur":4,"text":"that people can actually\nevaluate whether it's"},"622":{"dur":1,"text":"high-spending or low-spending."},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"- Earlier you did talk about\n the cap at a news conference."},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"That was one of the\nsignificant things that you saw"},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"out of the whole reform effort."},"631":{"dur":4,"text":"And I go back to many sessions\n where caps were proposed,"},"636":{"dur":3,"text":"and the cities and counties\n  would come and object."},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"It seems like this\n   one went through"},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"without too much discussion."},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"- Well, I think the\nreason it worked, Dave,"},"646":{"dur":4,"text":"is because for the first\ntime in history really"},"650":{"dur":3,"text":"we did a comprehensive\n reform of everything."},"654":{"dur":4,"text":"And in the past, if you just\n  change like pieces of it,"},"658":{"dur":4,"text":"and then you start talking\n  about caps, it doesn't work"},"662":{"dur":4,"text":"because you haven't\nreally fixed the system."},"666":{"dur":3,"text":"Once we consolidated\n  a whole bunch of old"},"670":{"dur":3,"text":"mill levy authorities\ninto single authorities,"},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"like the General\n  Fund Levy Authority,"},"676":{"dur":3,"text":"then everybody knows what\n   they have to get done"},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"for that number of mills 'cause\nit's the same everywhere."},"682":{"dur":3,"text":"And then people can begin\n   to evaluate what would be"},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"a fair overall cap\n   on that mill levy."},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"And we were able to\n  arrive at something"},"692":{"dur":4,"text":"that people were able to\n  accept because even the ones"},"696":{"dur":3,"text":"that were close to that limit\n said the new flexibility"},"700":{"dur":4,"text":"that we have with our\n   revenues more than offsets"},"704":{"dur":3,"text":"the limitation of\n having an overall cap."},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"- Since we're in the area of\ntaxes, I would like to bring up"},"710":{"dur":4,"text":"the oil tax bill that\n   was introduced on day 70,"},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"but from what I've been led\n  to believe there had been"},"717":{"dur":3,"text":"some preliminary discussions,\n possibly with your office."},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"Is that correct?"},"723":{"dur":1,"text":"- No, not really."},"725":{"dur":4,"text":"That bill was definitely a\n   late entry into the scene."},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"I did not know\n  that that was going"},"736":{"dur":3,"text":"to be introduced\n   as a delayed bill."},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"And you know, a lot of people\n have asked me about it."},"743":{"dur":5,"text":"I have now signed the bill, and\nyes, it's unusual for a bill"},"749":{"dur":4,"text":"like that to begin the\n  process late in the session."},"753":{"dur":3,"text":"But in the end, you had to\n   look at it on it's merits."},"757":{"dur":3,"text":"And basically I think in\n  the end it can be portrayed"},"761":{"dur":5,"text":"as a fair trade off between\n  triggered lower taxes,"},"766":{"dur":4,"text":"which we've had in the\n past, versus a steady,"},"770":{"dur":5,"text":"never-changing, slightly\nlower rate that we can"},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"count on over time."},"778":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think most people felt\n that it was a fair trade off."},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"- [Dave] Was it a\n  tough call for you?"},"784":{"dur":5,"text":"- Not really, because\nmy job requires me to be"},"791":{"dur":4,"text":"interested in the reliabiliy\n  of our revenue streams"},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"and how predictable they are."},"797":{"dur":4,"text":"And so in that sense, the\n  legislation makes it better"},"802":{"dur":3,"text":"for people who are trying\n   to run a state government."},"807":{"dur":4,"text":"- And one thing in\n  the whole oil arena,"},"811":{"dur":2,"text":"you've made some proposals\n   about pipeline safety"},"813":{"dur":3,"text":"and rail safety, and especially\nin light of what happened"},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"in Castleton with the\n derailment and fire"},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"and some of the pipeline spills."},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"Are you happy with what the\n  Legislature came up with?"},"825":{"dur":1,"text":"- I am."},"826":{"dur":4,"text":"In the end they did fund\na Rail Safety Inspector"},"830":{"dur":3,"text":"directed by the State\n   Public Service Commission,"},"834":{"dur":4,"text":"and some additional funds\n   for a temporary employee"},"838":{"dur":2,"text":"to help with that."},"841":{"dur":3,"text":"You know it became like\na kind of a big issue"},"844":{"dur":5,"text":"toward the end of the session,\n and it's probably overblown"},"849":{"dur":1,"text":"in terms of it's importance."},"851":{"dur":3,"text":"But I felt that it was very\n important that the state have"},"854":{"dur":2,"text":"some function in that area."},"856":{"dur":4,"text":"That there is at least\n   one or two employees that"},"861":{"dur":4,"text":"go out there and act at the\n  request of state government,"},"866":{"dur":3,"text":"not of the federal\n  government or the railroad."},"869":{"dur":2,"text":"And if we wanna check on\nsomething in

we can do that."},"881":{"dur":3,"text":"And that person is gonna\n   be directed by the state."},"885":{"dur":2,"text":"- And on the area\n  of pipeline safety,"},"887":{"dur":2,"text":"there were a couple\n   things that came to mind."},"889":{"dur":3,"text":"Of course, just the\ninspection of pipelines,"},"893":{"dur":2,"text":"there's some of that, and\n   also for the first time"},"896":{"dur":1,"text":"the state's going to\n be regulating some of"},"898":{"dur":1,"text":"the gathering pipelines."},"899":{"dur":4,"text":"- That's right, and we did have\na breakthrough there as well."},"904":{"dur":2,"text":"That legislation, I think, was a"},"906":{"dur":2,"text":"little bit misunderstood, too."},"908":{"dur":4,"text":"It does provide\n for the Industrial\n

pipelines."},"921":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's a very important\n  function, I think,"},"924":{"dur":2,"text":"especially with\n waste water pipelines"},"927":{"dur":3,"text":"which are filled\n   with salty water."},"931":{"dur":4,"text":"We need a function in that\n   area, and we did get that."},"935":{"dur":1,"text":"There was a kind of\n  a misunderstanding"},"937":{"dur":3,"text":"at the

to be"},"948":{"dur":5,"text":"to tell the Industrial\nCommission what monitors to use."},"954":{"dur":1,"text":"- Are you okay with that?"},"955":{"dur":3,"text":"- Well, I think, you know\n   it's a big responsibility"},"959":{"dur":3,"text":"for those of us who are on\n   the Industrial Commission,"},"962":{"dur":5,"text":"And I think that we\n  will do a good job."},"968":{"dur":2,"text":"We've done a good\n   job in the past,"},"970":{"dur":3,"text":"but obviously this is\n a fast-moving area."},"974":{"dur":5,"text":"The technology of these\n pipelines is changing

an eye on them,\n   and we need to do that."},"991":{"dur":4,"text":"And thanks to this legislation\n it will be happening."},"995":{"dur":3,"text":"- So you're convinced\n that this is a safe,"},"999":{"dur":3,"text":"that this is going to make\n   things safer, perhaps?"},"1002":{"dur":2,"text":"- No question about it,"},"1005":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's vitally\n   important that we do that."},"1008":{"dur":3,"text":"People have to have\n confidence that these"},"1011":{"dur":2,"text":"fluids are gonna stay\n in the pipelines."},"1014":{"dur":2,"text":"Just as people have to\n have confidence that"},"1016":{"dur":3,"text":"the trains are gonna\n  stay on the tracks."},"1019":{"dur":4,"text":"And we have gotten\n some very, very useful"},"1024":{"dur":2,"text":"new tools in
