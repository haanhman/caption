undetected,"},"305":{"dur":3,"text":"it evaded detection\nfor three or four months when it began."},"308":{"dur":2,"text":"That's because this is not\na disease of West

about."},"423":{"dur":4,"text":"But what happened then was something\nwe had never seen before with Ebola."},"427":{"dur":4,"text":"What happened then was the virus,\nor someone sick with the

pop up again."},"441":{"dur":1,"text":"This time it was in Nigeria,"},"443":{"dur":4,"text":"in the teeming metropolis\nof Lagos, 21 million people;"},"448":{"dur":3,"text":"now the virus was in that

years"},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"caused by a disease like this."},"460":{"dur":4,"text":"The World Health Organization immediately\ncalled together an expert panel,"},"465":{"dur":3,"text":"looked at

assistance"},"475":{"dur":5,"text":"to help these countries which were in\nso much trouble and concern at that time."},"480":{"dur":3,"text":"But what we saw\nwas something very different."},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"There was some great response."},"488":{"dur":4,"text":"A number of countries came to assist\n- many NGOs and others, as you know -"},"492":{"dur":3,"text":"but at the same time,\nthe opposite happened in many places."},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"Alarm escalated, and very soon,"},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"these countries found themselves"},"502":{"dur":4,"text":"not receiving the support they needed\nbut increasingly isolated."},"506":{"dur":4,"text":"What we saw was commercial airlines\n[stopped] flying into these countries,"},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"and people who hadn't even been\nexposed to the virus"},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"were no longer allowed to travel."},"516":{"dur":3,"text":"This caused not only problems,\nobviously, for the countries themselves"},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"but also for the response."},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"Those organizations\nthat we're trying to bring people in,"},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"to try and help

respond."},"532":{"dur":5,"text":"In that situation, ladies and gentleman,\na virus like Ebola takes advantage."},"538":{"dur":4,"text":"And what we saw then was something\nalso we hadn't seen before:"},"542":{"dur":2,"text":"not only did this virus\ncontinue in the places"},"545":{"dur":4,"text":"where they'd already become infected\nbut then it started to escalate"},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"and we saw the case numbers\nthat you see here,"},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"something we never seen\nbefore on such a scale,"},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"and exponential increase of Ebola cases"},"557":{"dur":4,"text":"not just in these countries or the areas\nalready infected in these countries"},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"but also spreading further\nand deeper into these countries."},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"Ladies and gentleman,"},"567":{"dur":5,"text":"this was one of the most concerning,\ninternational emergencies in public health"},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"we've ever seen."},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"And what happened\nin these countries then,"},"576":{"dur":3,"text":"many of you saw, again, on the television,\nread about in the newspapers,"},"580":{"dur":5,"text":"we saw the health system start to collapse\nunder the weight of this epidemic."},"585":{"dur":2,"text":"We saw the schools begin to close,"},"590":{"dur":3,"text":"markets no longer functioned the way\nthat they should in these countries."},"594":{"dur":3,"text":"We saw the misinformation,\nthe misperceptions, started to spread"},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"even faster through the communities"},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"which became even more alarmed\nabout the situation."},"603":{"dur":1,"text":"They started to recoil"},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"from those people that you saw\nin those space suits, as they call them,"},"607":{"dur":1,"text":"who had come to help them."},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"And then the situation\ndeteriorated even further:"},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"the countries had to declare\na state of emergency,"},"615":{"dur":5,"text":"large populations need to be quarantined\nin some areas, and then riots broke out."},"620":{"dur":3,"text":"It was a very, very terrifying situation."},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"And the world, many people began to ask:"},"627":{"dur":3,"text":"\"Can we ever stop Ebola\nwhen it starts to spread like this?\""},"631":{"dur":4,"text":"And they started to ask: \"How well\ndo we really know this virus?\""},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"The reality is we don't know\nEbola extremely well."},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a relatively modern disease\nin terms of what we know about it"},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"we've known the disease only for 40 years"},"645":{"dur":3,"text":"since it first popped up\nin Central Africa in 1976."},"648":{"dur":3,"text":"But despite that, we do know many things:"},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"we know that this virus probably\nsurvives in a type of a bat,"},"655":{"dur":3,"text":"we know that it probably enters\na human population"},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"when we come in contact with a wild animal"},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"that has been infected with the virus\nand probably sickened by it."},"665":{"dur":3,"text":"Then we know that the virus\nspreads from person to person"},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"through contaminated body fluids."},"670":{"dur":1,"text":"And as you've all seen,"},"672":{"dur":3,"text":"we know the horrific disease\nthat it then causes in humans,"},"675":{"dur":4,"text":"where we see this disease caused\nsevere fevers, diarrhea, vomiting,"},"680":{"dur":6,"text":"and then, unfortunately, and in 70%\nof the cases or often more, death."},"686":{"dur":5,"text":"This is a very dangerous,\ndebilitating, and deadly disease."},"692":{"dur":4,"text":"But despite the fact that we've not known\nthis disease for a particularly long time,"},"696":{"dur":4,"text":"and we don't know everything about it,\nwe do know how to stop this disease."},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"There are four things\nthat are critical to stopping Ebola."},"704":{"dur":4,"text":"First and foremost, the communities\nhave got to understand this disease,"},"708":{"dur":3,"text":"they've got to understand\nhow it spreads and how to stop it."},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"And then we've got\nto be able to have systems"},"714":{"dur":3,"text":"that could find every single case,\nevery contact of those cases,"},"718":{"dur":4,"text":"and begin to track the transmission chain\nso that you can stop transmission."},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"We have to have treatment centers,\nspecialized Ebola treatment centers,"},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"where the workers can be protected"},"728":{"dur":4,"text":"as they try to provide support\nto the people who are infected,"},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"so that they might survive the disease"},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, for those who do die,"},"738":{"dur":5,"text":"we have to ensure there is a safe but at\nthe same time dignified burial process,"},"743":{"dur":4,"text":"so that there is no spread\nat that time as well."},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"So we do know how to stop Ebola,"},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"and these strategies work,\nladies and gentlemen."},"753":{"dur":3,"text":"The virus was stopped in Nigeria\nby these four strategies,"},"757":{"dur":2,"text":"and the people\nimplementing them, obviously."},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"It was stopped in Senegal\nwhere it had spread,"},"762":{"dur":1,"text":"and also in the other countries"},"764":{"dur":3,"text":"that were affected by this virus,\nin this outbreak."},"767":{"dur":4,"text":"So there's no question\nthat these strategies actually work."},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"The big question, ladies and gentlemen,"},"773":{"dur":5,"text":"was whether these strategies could work\non this scale, in this situation,"},"779":{"dur":5,"text":"with so many countries affected\nwith the exponential growth that you saw."},"784":{"dur":4,"text":"That was the big question that we were\nfacing just two for three months ago."},"789":{"dur":4,"text":"Today, we know the answer\nto that question."},"793":{"dur":3,"text":"We know that answer\nbecause of the extraordinary work"},"796":{"dur":4,"text":"of an incredible group of NGOs,\nof governments, of local leaders,"},"801":{"dur":4,"text":"of UN agencies, and many humanitarian\nand other organizations"},"805":{"dur":4,"text":"that came and joined the fight\nto try and stop Ebola in West Africa."},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"But what had to be done\nthere was slightly different."},"812":{"dur":3,"text":"These countries took\nthose strategies I just showed you;"},"815":{"dur":4,"text":"the communities, the community engagement,\nthe case finding and contact tracing,"},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"and they turn them on their head."},"823":{"dur":2,"text":"There was so much disease,\nthey approached it differently."},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"What they decided to do was"},"828":{"dur":3,"text":"they would first try\nand slow down this epidemic"},"831":{"dur":2,"text":"by rapidly building\nas many beds as possible"},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"in specialized treatment centers,"},"836":{"dur":5,"text":"so that they could prevent the disease\nfrom spreading from those were infected."},"841":{"dur":2,"text":"They would rapidly build out\nmany many burial teams"},"844":{"dur":2,"text":"so they could safely deal\nwith the dead,"},"846":{"dur":2,"text":"and with that, they would try\nand slow this outbreak to see"},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"if it could actually then be controlled"},"851":{"dur":4,"text":"using the classic approach\nof case finding and contact tracing."},"855":{"dur":4,"text":"And when I went to West Africa\nabout three months ago, when I was there,"},"860":{"dur":2,"text":"what I saw was extraordinary."},"862":{"dur":1,"text":"I saw presidents"},"863":{"dur":3,"text":"opening emergency operation centers\nthemselves against Ebola"},"867":{"dur":3,"text":"so that they could personally coordinate,\nand oversee, and champion"},"870":{"dur":3,"text":"this surge of international support\nto try and stop this disease."},"874":{"dur":1,"text":"We saw militaries"},"875":{"dur":2,"text":"from within those countries\nand from far beyond,"},"878":{"dur":2,"text":"coming in to help build\nEbola treatment centers"},"881":{"dur":3,"text":"that could be used to isolate\nthose who are

that they\ncould actually safely bury their dead"},"894":{"dur":2,"text":"in a dignified manner themselves."},"897":{"dur":2,"text":"And we saw the UN agencies,\nthe World Food Program,"},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"build a tremendous air bridge\nthat could get responders"},"902":{"dur":3,"text":"to every single corner\nof these countries rapidly"},"905":{"dur":3,"text":"to be able to implement the strategies\nthat we just talked about."},"909":{"dur":3,"text":"What we saw, ladies and gentlemen,\nwhich is probably most impressive,"},"912":{"dur":3,"text":"was this incredible work\nby the governments,"},"915":{"dur":3,"text":"by the leaders in these countries,\nwith the communities,"},"919":{"dur":2,"text":"to try insure\npeople understood this

we saw was"},"937":{"dur":4,"text":"what you see now in this graph\nwhen we took stock on December 1."},"942":{"dur":3,"text":"What we saw was\nwe could bend that curve, so to speak,"},"945":{"dur":2,"text":"change this exponential growth,"},"948":{"dur":3,"text":"and bring some hope back\nto the ability to control this outbreak."},"952":{"dur":4,"text":"And for this reason, ladies and gentlemen,\nthere's absolutely no question now"},"956":{"dur":6,"text":"that we can catch up with this outbreak\nin West Africa, and we can beat Ebola."},"962":{"dur":3,"text":"The big question though,\nthat many people are asking,"},"966":{"dur":1,"text":"even when they saw this curve, [is]:"},"967":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Well, hang on a minute;\nthat's great, you can slow it down,"},"970":{"dur":2,"text":"but can you actually\ndrive it down to zero?\""},"972":{"dur":3,"text":"We've already answered that question\nright back at the beginning of this
