then with our new dependence\non infrastructure in space,"},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"our sensitivity\nto space weather,"},"365":{"dur":2,"text":"unfortunately,\nthese mysteries about the

why,"},"381":{"dur":4,"text":"and here's a picture taken by\nthe Solar Dynamics Observatory,"},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"in visible light of the sun\na couple years ago,"},"388":{"dur":1,"text":"and so here's the sun."},"390":{"dur":1,"text":"It's yellow,\nkind of boring, right?"},"391":{"dur":3,"text":"You know,\njust this yellow sphere."},"395":{"dur":3,"text":"It doesn't seem particularly\ndynamic or interesting, right?"},"398":{"dur":4,"text":"If you went out on any day,\nthis is what you'd see, right?"},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, why is the surface\nof the sun yellow, right?"},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"It's yellow\nbecause it's at a temperature"},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"of around 6,000 degrees Kelvin,"},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"So, if you look at your toaster"},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"and you get those heating\nelements nice and hot,"},"415":{"dur":3,"text":"they'll start glowing a yellow,\nan orange, right?"},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"This is called\nblack-body radiation."},"421":{"dur":3,"text":"So every object\nin the universe emits radiation,"},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"and the wavelength\nof the radiation"},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"is inversely proportional to\nthe temperature of the object."},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"So right now if I had, like,\ninfrared goggles on,"},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"I could see everyone in the room\njust from the infrared light"},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"that you're giving off 'cause\nyour body's at room temperature."},"437":{"dur":1,"text":"If you get hotter,"},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"you'll actually start\nto emit visible light,"},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"so you move from infrared"},"442":{"dur":3,"text":"into very dull reds,\ndarker reds, yellows--"},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"sorry, oranges,\nand then yellows."},"448":{"dur":3,"text":"And so the surface\nof the sun glows yellow"},"452":{"dur":3,"text":"because it's at a temperature\nof around 6,000 degrees."},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"What you're seeing\nis the end product of the fusion"},"457":{"dur":1,"text":"happening at the core\nof the sun."},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"So, at the center of the sun\nthe pressure is so high,"},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"the density's so high\nthat hydrogen fuses,"},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"making helium, releasing energy."},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"That brings the temperature\nof the core of the sun"},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"up to more than\n100 million degrees."},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"And then just the further away\nyou get from that heat source,"},"476":{"dur":1,"text":"the same way, you know,"},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"if you pull your hand\naway from an open flame,"},"480":{"dur":1,"text":"the cooler things get."},"481":{"dur":1,"text":"The temperature\nslowly falls off"},"483":{"dur":1,"text":"the further away\nyou get from the sun"},"485":{"dur":1,"text":"until you're out at the surface"},"486":{"dur":3,"text":"where things are a relatively\nbalmy 6,000 degrees,"},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"and the only exceptions--"},"492":{"dur":3,"text":"just if you look carefully,\nyou'll see every now and then,"},"495":{"dur":2,"text":"there are some black splotches\nthat appear on the sun."},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"These are sunspots."},"500":{"dur":3,"text":"Here's a nice zoom-in\nof one of these sunspots,"},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"and what you see\nis a darker region."},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"It turns out every now and then,\na big piece"},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"of magnetic field erupts\nfrom the surface of the sun,"},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"and that magnetic field\nis so strong,"},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"it actually stops the sun\nfrom boiling and churning there,"},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"and that piece of the sun's\natmosphere cools off,"},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"and so it looks dark to us"},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"'cause it's not giving off\nthat black-body radiation."},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"So sunspots are fantastic,"},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"but is this all\nthere is to the sun?"},"528":{"dur":3,"text":"And the answer is gonna be no."},"531":{"dur":3,"text":"So, you know, it's difficult\nto look at the sun, right?"},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, I don't want to\nencourage anyone to go out there"},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"and stare at the sun right now."},"538":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, it's so bright,\nit can blind you."},"539":{"dur":1,"text":"If you wear filters,"},"541":{"dur":3,"text":"you can look at the disc\nof the sun in visible light."},"545":{"dur":1,"text":"But what you really want to do"},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"to understand the mystery\nof the sun"},"548":{"dur":3,"text":"is to be able to get a chance\nto see what's above the surface."},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"Is there anything\ngoing on out here, right?"},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"Today we can look\nwith spacecraft"},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"that have special filters\nthat block the disc of the sun"},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"or look in wavelengths"},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"that are much brighter than\nemission from the sun itself."},"564":{"dur":3,"text":"But if you went back\n500 years

to see\nrays of material"},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"coming out from around the sun."},"626":{"dur":3,"text":"And so they called these rays\na solar crown,"},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"and another word for

today?"},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"Here's an eclipse seen from\nthe International Space Station"},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"over Turkey in March of 2006."},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is a

squint,"},"684":{"dur":4,"text":"you may just be able to make out\nsome craters on the moon."},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"The moon's doing a perfect job\nblocking out the sun,"},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"and instead of the very\nintense light from the sun,"},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"we see these rays\nof material appear."},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is the solar atmosphere,\nthe solar

crown,"},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"this ray-like structure."},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can see\nit's a couple things."},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"One, it's\nincredibly structured."},"714":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, you have some places"},"715":{"dur":3,"text":"where you just have rays\nof material coming straight out."},"718":{"dur":3,"text":"You have other regions\nwhere it bunches together."},"721":{"dur":3,"text":"If you're interested, what we're\nactually witnessing here"},"725":{"dur":1,"text":"is Thomson scattering of light,"},"726":{"dur":3,"text":"so white light\nfrom the sun is travelling out."},"729":{"dur":2,"text":"It's striking material\nin the solar corona,"},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"and then that light\nbounces off."},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we're able to see\nthat reflected light"},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"off of the material\nin the solar atmosphere."},"738":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not actually emitting\nin visible light."},"740":{"dur":3,"text":"It's just reflecting\nvisible light from the sun."},"743":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay, great."},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"So people commented\nabout these rays"},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"for hundreds of years."},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"It's interesting--the sun\nhas an extended atmosphere."},"752":{"dur":1,"text":"So what, right?"},"753":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, the scale height\nof that corona is a big problem,"},"758":{"dur":1,"text":"although people didn't really\nappreciate this"},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"until
