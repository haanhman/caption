wonderful,"},"1077":{"dur":1,"text":"this is actually in Jackson, Mississippi,"},"1079":{"dur":3,"text":"in a wonderful gallery that\nhas this strange kind of"},"1082":{"dur":4,"text":"hook system on the ceiling\nthat I was able to use."},"1087":{"dur":2,"text":"And then this is beginning to be a lot of"},"1089":{"dur":2,"text":"collaborative work, so while\nI'm doing all this work,"},"1091":{"dur":3,"text":"I also have a practice of collaboration."},"1095":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is a piece from\nEstonia, from Tallinn,"},"1098":{"dur":3,"text":"and I went there, and I\nhave proposed doing a piece"},"1101":{"dur":2,"text":"that would be done all onsite."},"1104":{"dur":2,"text":"And that was also a strategy\nthat I had used a lot"},"1106":{"dur":3,"text":"in my work, where I would\narrive at a gallery,"},"1109":{"dur":2,"text":"basically, go and rent\na truck from Lowe's,"},"1112":{"dur":2,"text":"bring a bunch of drywall, cut\na bunch of drywall, mount it"},"1114":{"dur":4,"text":"on the walls, and use the\ngallery almost as a studio."},"1119":{"dur":1,"text":"And so this was made in five days,"},"1121":{"dur":2,"text":"and it was quite an elaborate piece,"},"1123":{"dur":3,"text":"with a really wonderful group of people,"},"1127":{"dur":1,"text":"students and professional artists."},"1129":{"dur":3,"text":"And so it was myself, and there\nwere two people from Spain,"},"1132":{"dur":3,"text":"a woman from China, three Estonians,"},"1136":{"dur":2,"text":"a woman from Germany, a woman from Cuba."},"1139":{"dur":4,"text":"And so it's very, and\nvarying degrees of language,"},"1143":{"dur":2,"text":"but, because art is a language,"},"1146":{"dur":1,"text":"we were really able to communicate."},"1148":{"dur":3,"text":"And so there's, how to make a\npiece without a single author,"},"1152":{"dur":3,"text":"and that's something I'm also\nreally interested in, is that."},"1155":{"dur":2,"text":"And so this was, and they\ncame up with the theme,"},"1158":{"dur":1,"text":"and it was called Rabbit Saves the World."},"1160":{"dur":1,"text":"And so, there was this whole story,"},"1161":{"dur":1,"text":"oh, and then there was also a woman,"},"1163":{"dur":4,"text":"she's a Dine Navajo, so that\nalso, I felt, really enriched,"},"1168":{"dur":4,"text":"because of the idea of storytelling\nin her cultural history."},"1173":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, we just sort of made\nthese stories, those are"},"1177":{"dur":2,"text":"Russian books that the students\nwere sort of talking about,"},"1180":{"dur":1,"text":"the Estonian students\nsort of talking about"},"1181":{"dur":2,"text":"the Russian occupation."},"1184":{"dur":3,"text":"And then we had rabbit sort\nof going through all these"},"1187":{"dur":2,"text":"perils and adventures, and the prints,"},"1190":{"dur":1,"text":"some of the prints were quite beautiful."},"1192":{"dur":3,"text":"And then on the floor is\nsort of this map of the city,"},"1196":{"dur":2,"text":"just with tape, and it\nwas a great way to just,"},"1198":{"dur":3,"text":"connect things, and it was really fun."},"1202":{"dur":3,"text":"The funny thing about it was,\nI just went in and did this,"},"1205":{"dur":2,"text":"because I've been doing this with students"},"1208":{"dur":2,"text":"at different schools in different places,"},"1211":{"dur":2,"text":"and my students are very used to me."},"1214":{"dur":2,"text":"I just went in and started\ntalking to these students,"},"1216":{"dur":1,"text":"and say, yeah, this\nwhat we're going to do."},"1218":{"dur":2,"text":"And so at the opening,\nthey were so excited,"},"1221":{"dur":2,"text":"but they told me that\nthey thought I was crazy."},"1223":{"dur":1,"text":"(audience laughs)"},"1225":{"dur":2,"text":"They said we thought you were insane."},"1228":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was like, no, it worked."},"1230":{"dur":1,"text":"And they're like, you know,"},"1231":{"dur":1,"text":"and they said, you know, they\nhad never seen this gallery,"},"1233":{"dur":2,"text":"you know this was a very,\nI didn't know this but,"},"1236":{"dur":2,"text":"you know, framed work, matted, framed,"},"1239":{"dur":1,"text":"hung on the wall kind of space."},"1240":{"dur":1,"text":"And I came without even knowing it,"},"1242":{"dur":2,"text":"and it sort of broke a lot of rules,"},"1245":{"dur":3,"text":"but I didn't know the rules,\nso, I didn't do it on purpose."},"1249":{"dur":3,"text":"And then this is a build up\nof, this is the second step"},"1252":{"dur":2,"text":"of the Rabbit Saves the World series."},"1254":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is in Bristol in England."},"1257":{"dur":2,"text":"And for this piece, I just\nput out a call for artists"},"1259":{"dur":1,"text":"to send me things."},"1261":{"dur":4,"text":"And so artists would send\nme, just even a small thing."},"1265":{"dur":3,"text":"On the bottom here, right here,"},"1268":{"dur":4,"text":"this is a print of a dead\nmouse that an artist found,"},"1273":{"dur":1,"text":"and she just sent me one."},"1275":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I just, I duplicated it."},"1277":{"dur":4,"text":"So a lot of this is actually\ninkjet printing on rice paper,"},"1282":{"dur":4,"text":"and the theme of the conference\nwas Old World, New World."},"1287":{"dur":2,"text":"And they were sort of\ntaking that as a larger,"},"1289":{"dur":1,"text":"not only England,"},"1291":{"dur":3,"text":"but also in a larger\ncontext of printmaking."},"1294":{"dur":2,"text":"The old traditions and the new traditions,"},"1297":{"dur":2,"text":"and so I took it,\nobviously, as an American."},"1299":{"dur":3,"text":"But people would send me very\nsmall things through the mail,"},"1302":{"dur":1,"text":"and then I would make them large,"},"1304":{"dur":2,"text":"or I'd make them very multiple."},"1307":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I also did this\nsort of the old world,"},"1310":{"dur":3,"text":"and then the new world, sort\nof division between the spaces."},"1313":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was really fun, because\nthen people would come,"},"1316":{"dur":2,"text":"and they would find their little elements"},"1318":{"dur":1,"text":"and things like that."},"1319":{"dur":2,"text":"And the school was really nice,\nthey liked the piece a lot,"},"1322":{"dur":2,"text":"and they asked if they could\nkeep it up and I said fine."},"1324":{"dur":4,"text":"And then they were concerned\nabout returning the work to me."},"1329":{"dur":1,"text":"But I found out that they\nhad a book arts class,"},"1331":{"dur":2,"text":"and so they retained all that material"},"1333":{"dur":2,"text":"to be able to do and to book works,"},"1336":{"dur":3,"text":"because I very seldom do things twice,"},"1340":{"dur":3,"text":"which is ironic for a printmaker."},"1343":{"dur":4,"text":"This is another, kind of\na performance-esqe piece."},"1348":{"dur":4,"text":"This piece, for two years,\nI maintained a virtual farm."},"1353":{"dur":2,"text":"You guys have all heard\nabout Farmville, right?"},"1356":{"dur":2,"text":"So for two years I had a\nfarm, and the first year"},"1358":{"dur":3,"text":"I turned it into a\nvirtual artist residency."},"1362":{"dur":3,"text":"So not unlike the Grant Wood Colony."},"1365":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I would invite artists,"},"1368":{"dur":3,"text":"and I had this very elaborate,\nwhat was in these buildings,"},"1371":{"dur":2,"text":"that there was this elaborate studio,"},"1374":{"dur":2,"text":"and this wonderful B and B,"},"1377":{"dur":4,"text":"and of course, it's\njust Facebook Farmville."},"1381":{"dur":4,"text":"But I would award residencies to artists,"},"1385":{"dur":2,"text":"so it was sort of the virtual residency"},"1387":{"dur":2,"text":"when you have virtually no time."},"1390":{"dur":2,"text":"And so when people would\nbe very, very busy,"},"1392":{"dur":3,"text":"I would award them a virtual residency,"},"1395":{"dur":1,"text":"so they could make art."},"1397":{"dur":2,"text":"And so here, then I also had rules,"},"1402":{"dur":2,"text":"about I only farmed with other artists."},"1405":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, there were other artists\nthat all have these farms,"},"1408":{"dur":1,"text":"and we were farming together"},"1410":{"dur":2,"text":"and I was running this residency."},"1414":{"dur":1,"text":"Then we did a portfolio exchange,"},"1416":{"dur":1,"text":"which is a wonderful tradition."},"1418":{"dur":2,"text":"It's actually become\na very large tradition"},"1420":{"dur":2,"text":"within printmaking for\nprofessional printmakers"},"1423":{"dur":1,"text":"to do these exchanges."},"1425":{"dur":3,"text":"And so what you do is you find 20 artists,"},"1428":{"dur":3,"text":"and you ask them if they\nwant to be in an exchange,"},"1432":{"dur":1,"text":"and then you each print 20 prints,"},"1434":{"dur":1,"text":"and so, you sort of do a trade."},"1435":{"dur":1,"text":"And they're usually thematic,"},"1437":{"dur":1,"text":"there's usually a reason for them."},"1438":{"dur":3,"text":"And so this was, of course, Farmville,"},"1442":{"dur":2,"text":"and you know, a farm one."},"1444":{"dur":2,"text":"So each artist printed a print,"},"1448":{"dur":2,"text":"and then I digitally printed\nout a picture of their farm,"},"1451":{"dur":3,"text":"which is sideways, and then their print,"},"1454":{"dur":3,"text":"that they made for the\nportfolio is also printed out."},"1458":{"dur":3,"text":"And then I got these,\nthese are called woodies,"},"1461":{"dur":2,"text":"from Ben Franklin's and different places"},"1464":{"dur":2,"text":"that come in all these shapes."},"1466":{"dur":1,"text":"And so people could ink those up"},"1468":{"dur":3,"text":"and then add those to the\nfarms, as they wanted."},"1472":{"dur":1,"text":"That's me. (laughs)"},"1473":{"dur":3,"text":"But that was the entryway into the piece."},"1478":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, I'm not a performer,"},"1482":{"dur":3,"text":"it's really hard, even for\nme to talk, like in a talk."},"1486":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not something I do a lot."},"1488":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm not a lecturer, I'm not\na professor that does that."},"1492":{"dur":2,"text":"So performing is also kind of like a thing"},"1494":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't like to do."},"1495":{"dur":3,"text":"But every now and then, you\nsort of have to do something,"},"1498":{"dur":4,"text":"and so I was invited to be in\na 10-year anniversary of 9\/11."},"1504":{"dur":3,"text":"And so what I did was I Xeroxed"},"1507":{"dur":4,"text":"all the names of all the\npeople who died on 9\/11."},"1511":{"dur":2,"text":"And then I put them in stacks"},"1513":{"dur":2,"text":"for the two World Trade buildings,"},"1516":{"dur":2,"text":"each of the buildings, each of the planes."},"1519":{"dur":3,"text":"And in the drawer was\na name of a hijacker."},"1522":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I did this piece, it\nwas sort of an endurance piece,"},"1524":{"dur":2,"text":"because I did it for 19 consecutive hours,"},"1527":{"dur":3,"text":"which is really weird,\nbecause it wasn't that hard."},"1530":{"dur":2,"text":"At a certain point you\nreally are in a trance."},"1532":{"dur":3,"text":"What was hard was when I\ngot up, and had to like,"},"1536":{"dur":4,"text":"go back into the world,\nthat was really difficult."},"1541":{"dur":2,"text":"So I just folded these planes,"},"1544":{"dur":2,"text":"and then every hour a bell would go off,"},"1547":{"dur":3,"text":"and I'd open that drawer\nand I'd fold a plane."},"1550":{"dur":3,"text":"And for me, it was just,\nit was a symbol of everyone"},"1554":{"dur":3,"text":"being victims, and it's\ncalled The Bluest Sky,"},"1558":{"dur":2,"text":"because that is probably\nmy greatest memory,"},"1560":{"dur":2,"text":"was how blue that sky was."},"1565":{"dur":2,"text":"And then this is Liz Lerman,"},"1567":{"dur":3,"text":"and I love Hancher, very, very much."},"1570":{"dur":3,"text":"And I really feel bad that\nI moved here 10 years ago,"},"1573":{"dur":2,"text":"so I really only experienced\ntwo years of Hancher,"},"1576":{"dur":2,"text":"and my daughter grew up without Hancher,"},"1578":{"dur":2,"text":"which I think, we still did things,"},"1581":{"dur":3,"text":"but you know, we had to\ngo places to do them,"},"1584":{"dur":1,"text":"other places."},"1587":{"dur":1,"text":"She grew up with Hancher,"},"1588":{"dur":3,"text":"but not the same Hancher that\nshe would've experienced."},"1592":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is a woodcut\nclass, that I taught,"},"1596":{"dur":1,"text":"and Liz Lerman came in,"},"1597":{"dur":2,"text":"and she was doing a pop up museum,"},"1599":{"dur":2,"text":"and she did this piece that\nwas highly collaborative"},"1602":{"dur":1,"text":"with the dance department."},"1604":{"dur":4,"text":"And it was about the 150th\nanniversary of the Civil War,"},"1609":{"dur":2,"text":"and also sort of honoring\nthe role of nurses."},"1612":{"dur":2,"text":"And she's a really\nwonderful, wonderful person,"},"1614":{"dur":0,"text":"very generous."},"1615":{"dur":2,"text":"And so she came, and she\ntalked to the students"},"1617":{"dur":2,"text":"and talked to them about\nhow to look at art,"},"1620":{"dur":3,"text":"and how to critique art,\nand how to think about,"},"1623":{"dur":1,"text":"how to be an artist in the world."},"1625":{"dur":2,"text":"And those are conversations\nI'm very, very interested in."},"1628":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we made these long banners,"},"1630":{"dur":2,"text":"and there's like nine of them."},"1634":{"dur":3,"text":"They hung over the south\nentrance of the library,"},"1637":{"dur":1,"text":"which they were so nice to let me"},"1639":{"dur":2,"text":"hang from these banisters and over these,"},"1642":{"dur":2,"text":"kind of created tents in the other area."},"1645":{"dur":2,"text":"But then a lot of, there\nwere several performances,"},"1647":{"dur":1,"text":"this was called a pop up museum,"},"1649":{"dur":1,"text":"so there are all these\ndifferent things going on"},"1651":{"dur":2,"text":"in the library, which I also really love"},"1654":{"dur":3,"text":"that relationship of the\nlibrary and a museum."},"1659":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's something that\nKathy Edwards and Sean O'Hara"},"1663":{"dur":1,"text":"speak to me a lot about."},"1665":{"dur":4,"text":"The idea of the University\nof Iowa Museum of Art,"},"1669":{"dur":4,"text":"as a library, and now it's\nactually going to be connected"},"1674":{"dur":1,"text":"to the library, which is very exciting,"},"1676":{"dur":3,"text":"because their view was, it\nwas here for the students"},"1679":{"dur":2,"text":"and part of what you're supposed to do."},"1681":{"dur":2,"text":"So the dancers worked with these,"},"1684":{"dur":1,"text":"and as well, some theater people."},"1685":{"dur":2,"text":"So they were Velcroed, so they\nwere very easy to pull down,"},"1688":{"dur":2,"text":"and, because we knew\nthey were gonna do that."},"1691":{"dur":1,"text":"It wasn't like they\njust came and did that,"},"1692":{"dur":1,"text":"they asked about that,"},"1693":{"dur":1,"text":"and I love that other layer."},"1695":{"dur":2,"text":"And so several times\nthey visited the class,"},"1698":{"dur":4,"text":"and so it was very\ncollaborative and very fun."},"1702":{"dur":2,"text":"This is a Justseeds project,"},"1704":{"dur":1,"text":"and this was for the Climate March,"},"1706":{"dur":2,"text":"and Justseeds is a collective."},"1709":{"dur":2,"text":"A lot of printmaking\noutside of the university"},"1712":{"dur":1,"text":"is done with collectives."},"1713":{"dur":2,"text":"In part, because we need\na lot of big machines,"},"1716":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's very, very expensive."},"1718":{"dur":2,"text":"And so people come together\nand form collectives."},"1720":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, Justseeds is a\nvery famous political one,"},"1723":{"dur":3,"text":"and so they were doing these posters,"},"1726":{"dur":2,"text":"and anyone could be a representative,"},"1728":{"dur":1,"text":"and they would send you these posters,"},"1730":{"dur":1,"text":"and then all you had to\ndo was photograph them."},"1732":{"dur":2,"text":"And so this is actually Brianne Trammel"},"1734":{"dur":4,"text":"who was another Virginia\nMyers visiting professor."},"1738":{"dur":4,"text":"Her silk screen class, and\nthen a bunch of other people,"},"1743":{"dur":3,"text":"whoever wanted to went\nand George has let us put"},"1746":{"dur":2,"text":"a whole bunch of these up on their wall,"},"1749":{"dur":2,"text":"and some of them might still be there."},"1751":{"dur":1,"text":"And then a few other places around town."},"1753":{"dur":3,"text":"But we got permission, but we\ndo talk about some of that,"},"1756":{"dur":2,"text":"like, art is intervention,"},"1759":{"dur":2,"text":"which some people might call vandalism,"},"1761":{"dur":2,"text":"but we don't call it that."},"1764":{"dur":4,"text":"And so then India is\na big part of my life."},"1768":{"dur":3,"text":"And I never really thought to go there,"},"1771":{"dur":1,"text":"I just had a student from India,"},"1773":{"dur":3,"text":"who decided I needed to go there."},"1776":{"dur":3,"text":"For some reason, my life seems\nto be a series of accidents."},"1780":{"dur":3,"text":"Or, students deciding\nthings that I needed to do."},"1784":{"dur":3,"text":"So I organized a student\ntrip, and then I moved here,"},"1788":{"dur":1,"text":"that was in Tennessee,\nand then I moved here,"},"1789":{"dur":2,"text":"and I found out about\nthe Winterim Program,"},"1792":{"dur":3,"text":"and so I've been organizing\ntrips ever since."},"1795":{"dur":2,"text":"And the thing that I love\nabout taking students to India,"},"1798":{"dur":1,"text":"there's so many things I love"},"1799":{"dur":1,"text":"about taking students to India,"},"1801":{"dur":2,"text":"but I really love them\nto be a visual minority,"},"1803":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's a big thing,"},"1804":{"dur":3,"text":"to really talk about\nthe problems in the art,"},"1808":{"dur":2,"text":"and how embedded the art\nand the traditions are."},"1811":{"dur":2,"text":"This is a group that went two years ago,"},"1813":{"dur":3,"text":"and we painted this mural\nat the Barefoot College,"},"1817":{"dur":2,"text":"which some of you may\nhave heard of Solar Mamas,"},"1820":{"dur":3,"text":"it's a film, it's a really\ngreat film, it's on Netflix,"},"1823":{"dur":3,"text":"and Bunker Roy, who has a\nTED Talk, is the founder."},"1826":{"dur":3,"text":"And he was a follower of\nGandhi, and so, what he does"},"1830":{"dur":3,"text":"is he empowers basically middle aged women"},"1833":{"dur":2,"text":"that they refer to as grandmothers."},"1836":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm went, really, but, okay."},"1839":{"dur":2,"text":"And they actually train and teach them,"},"1841":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's all about trying\nto keep the villages intact,"},"1845":{"dur":2,"text":"because one of the things\nthat you quickly figure out"},"1847":{"dur":2,"text":"about India is the importance of family."},"1850":{"dur":2,"text":"And when somebody is separate from that,"},"1853":{"dur":4,"text":"they really do not have a support system."},"1857":{"dur":3,"text":"And so keeping the villages\nintact is really important,"},"1860":{"dur":1,"text":"because people go to the cities,"},"1862":{"dur":2,"text":"and the slums just keep growing,\nand growing, and growing."},"1865":{"dur":2,"text":"And if they're in the village,"},"1867":{"dur":3,"text":"they can have a better quality of life."},"1870":{"dur":1,"text":"And so they train these women,"},"1872":{"dur":2,"text":"and they train women because men leave,"},"1874":{"dur":1,"text":"men will leave the village."},"1875":{"dur":1,"text":"They will take their new found skills"},"1877":{"dur":2,"text":"and go try to make money for their family,"},"1879":{"dur":2,"text":"but a lot of times then,"},"1882":{"dur":3,"text":"they just stop sending\nmoney to the families,"},"1885":{"dur":0,"text":"so it's a problem."},"1886":{"dur":3,"text":"So the students designed\nand did this mural,"},"1890":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's right across from where the women"},"1892":{"dur":3,"text":"who are learning about\nmaking solar cookers,"},"1896":{"dur":1,"text":"will walk out of,"},"1897":{"dur":3,"text":"and so it's sort of an homage to them."},"1902":{"dur":3,"text":"And they collaborated, and they had like"},"1905":{"dur":2,"text":"a week to talk about\nthis and figure it out,"},"1908":{"dur":1,"text":"so they did a great job."},"1910":{"dur":2,"text":"This is work that I did a lot\nof this work during the flood,"},"1912":{"dur":3,"text":"and I wanted to show this\nbecause it relates to Hancher."},"1915":{"dur":1,"text":"And I better hurry up."},"1917":{"dur":1,"text":"It relates to the Hancher piece,"},"1918":{"dur":3,"text":"and what I was doing was I was\nlooking at floodplain maps,"},"1921":{"dur":1,"text":"and then I was printing over them."},"1923":{"dur":1,"text":"And you can kinda see\nit's sort of this eclectic"},"1925":{"dur":2,"text":"kind of India coming in, and the flood."},"1927":{"dur":2,"text":"So I was sort of trying\nto process the flood,"},"1930":{"dur":2,"text":"because I was in one of\nthe displaced buildings,"},"1932":{"dur":3,"text":"and so we were at Menards, three\nand a half miles off campus"},"1935":{"dur":2,"text":"which was an amazing\nhardship for students,"},"1938":{"dur":3,"text":"more so than anyone, to\nhave to do the can bus"},"1942":{"dur":1,"text":"as an art student."},"1943":{"dur":4,"text":"You schlep enough, but having\nto add that was a lot more."},"1948":{"dur":2,"text":"This was a large series of\nwork that I did about floods"},"1951":{"dur":4,"text":"and floodplains, and also in\nIndia, rivers are very sacred."},"1956":{"dur":4,"text":"This is a later body of\nwork that I started doing,"},"1960":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'm still involved in this,"},"1963":{"dur":3,"text":"but it's gonna change\nbecause I changed buildings."},"1966":{"dur":2,"text":"And this work is about making\nand being in a building"},"1969":{"dur":3,"text":"with makers, and a lot\nof times all you'll see"},"1972":{"dur":2,"text":"is the residue, or you don't really know"},"1975":{"dur":2,"text":"what was made with something."},"1977":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm very involved with the laser cutters"},"1980":{"dur":4,"text":"and the computerized\nrouters and different tools,"},"1984":{"dur":3,"text":"and so I would take the\ndetritus, like the garbage"},"1988":{"dur":3,"text":"that was meant to be thrown\nout, and make prints from that."},"1991":{"dur":4,"text":"And I was also recycling, I\nwould have students sort of save"},"1995":{"dur":3,"text":"their ink after they\nhad finished printing,"},"1999":{"dur":1,"text":"and they'd have leftover ink."},"2001":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I was using that, and\nit was really just sort of"},"2003":{"dur":3,"text":"about trying to think about being a maker,"},"2006":{"dur":2,"text":"and lessening the footprint."},"2010":{"dur":3,"text":"But also, being in a\nbuilding with other makers,"},"2013":{"dur":4,"text":"which is really interesting\nbecause
