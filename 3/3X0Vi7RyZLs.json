technological\nadvances have, you know,"},"68":{"dur":4,"text":"undoubtedly contributed to\nthe loss of biodiversity"},"72":{"dur":2,"text":"and the loss of services\nwhich go with

along\ncan actually help us understand"},"90":{"dur":3,"text":"better how biodiversity\nis declining and then try"},"94":{"dur":3,"text":"to predict what the\nimpacts of climate

can\nengage people in nature"},"109":{"dur":2,"text":"and the environment around them."},"112":{"dur":2,"text":"And I hope to convince\nyou that I think"},"114":{"dur":5,"text":"that these new

crisis."},"125":{"dur":4,"text":"As humans use more of the\nresources on the planet"},"130":{"dur":4,"text":"and we have declines of\npopulations across the board,"},"134":{"dur":1,"text":"also and declines of habitats."},"136":{"dur":2,"text":"So the extinction\nis so alarming,"},"139":{"dur":5,"text":"that in 2002 the\nparties to the Convention"},"144":{"dur":2,"text":"on Biological

of\nbiodiversity loss at global,"},"160":{"dur":1,"text":"regional and national levels."},"162":{"dur":4,"text":"So, that's eight years, so\nit's a quite ambitious aim."},"167":{"dur":1,"text":"So, how did we do?"},"168":{"dur":1,"text":"So, I've put together\nthis, like,"},"170":{"dur":2,"text":"dashboard for biodiversity."},"173":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I've cut it up into\nthe state of biodiversity,"},"176":{"dur":3,"text":"the pressures of the fate\nthat biodiversity is facing,"},"180":{"dur":3,"text":"response, and the benefits\nthat we get from biodiversity,"},"183":{"dur":2,"text":"so think of this as a\nkind of [inaudible] screen"},"186":{"dur":3,"text":"so you can kind of see\nhow good things are going."},"190":{"dur":2,"text":"So, this is not a\ndepressing talk,"},"193":{"dur":2,"text":"but this is a depressing\n[laughter] find."},"196":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I rule the state of\ndiversity is pretty bad,"},"199":{"dur":2,"text":"so these are indicators\nthat we are using"},"202":{"dur":0,"text":"to kind of measure that."},"204":{"dur":3,"text":"So, if I don't have\nanything [inaudible]."},"208":{"dur":2,"text":"Oh, the mouse, how exciting."},"211":{"dur":3,"text":"This one up here is called\nthe living planet index,"},"216":{"dur":4,"text":"which is one that's run by WWF\n[inaudible], one for

there like,"},"231":{"dur":2,"text":"farm and birds --\nthere's that one."},"234":{"dur":1,"text":"Oh, it's disappeared now."},"235":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, it worked [inaudible]\nSo, the benefits --"},"238":{"dur":1,"text":"the pressures that are"},"240":{"dur":4,"text":"on biodiversity are\nalso increasing,"},"245":{"dur":1,"text":"so the portion [inaudible]\nover

LPI,"},"265":{"dur":3,"text":"Living Planet Index, but just\nfor species which you utilize,"},"269":{"dur":1,"text":"which are also declining."},"270":{"dur":5,"text":"So, you know, on the\nkind of positives notes,"},"275":{"dur":1,"text":"we're doing more\nabout it than we were,"},"277":{"dur":4,"text":"so the responses are\nalso increasing to try"},"281":{"dur":2,"text":"to mitigate some\nof these pressures"},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"in the state of biodiversity."},"286":{"dur":3,"text":"But, if that was a bit abstract\nfor you, I'll just bring it"},"289":{"dur":4,"text":"into focus; and these are\nfour species, which are --"},"293":{"dur":2,"text":"their numbers are actually\nfiguring in the 10s;"},"297":{"dur":2,"text":"not 10s of thousands,\nin their 10s."},"299":{"dur":3,"text":"So, this is one of my\nfavorite species, the kakapos,"},"303":{"dur":2,"text":"the most stupidest green\nparrot that you've ever seen,"},"306":{"dur":4,"text":"about this big, and its ground\ndwelling in New Zealand."},"310":{"dur":3,"text":"The awesomeness which is the\n'giant salamander' and --"},"314":{"dur":1,"text":"may we have the lights\ndown a bit?"},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"No? Oh, that's okay."},"319":{"dur":4,"text":"Fine. And the' Javan rhino',"},"323":{"dur":4,"text":"which has got very\nfew individuals left."},"327":{"dur":4,"text":"And, this one is the\nChinese river dolphin,"},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"which was last seen in 2004."},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"So, this isn't just\na bunch of figures,"},"337":{"dur":1,"text":"this is species going extinct."},"339":{"dur":2,"text":"So, why is that important?"},"341":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, part from its intrinsic\nvalue, which is also, you know,"},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"is a very important aspect to\n[inaudible] diversity laws,"},"350":{"dur":3,"text":"but a lot of -- oh, thank you."},"354":{"dur":2,"text":"Lots of advantages\nbeing put into thinking"},"357":{"dur":3,"text":"about what the effects are\nof biodiversity declining."},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"So, a number of publications\nhave come out recently,"},"364":{"dur":3,"text":"and this is just a kind\nof schematic from one"},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"of the latest ones, which is the"},"369":{"dur":4,"text":"\"National Ecosystem\nAssessment\" in 2011."},"373":{"dur":1,"text":"So, this kind of shows you,"},"375":{"dur":3,"text":"or illustrates how you\ncan help biodiversity,"},"378":{"dur":1,"text":"here on the right-hand side."},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"And then the goods and\nservices, like pollination"},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"or water quality, or\ndisease regulation,"},"385":{"dur":3,"text":"are coming from that part of\nSCV because it's from services"},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"from that biodiversity,\nand that fits"},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"into [inaudible]\naffects human wellbeing."},"393":{"dur":3,"text":"And then, anything that\naffects that, kind of cycles"},"397":{"dur":1,"text":"around to affect\nthe biodiversity,"},"399":{"dur":1,"text":"which then affects\nhuman wellbeing."},"401":{"dur":6,"text":"So, this is just one of the many\nof these conceptual frameworks"},"407":{"dur":1,"text":"which have been developed."},"409":{"dur":4,"text":"The first one was in \"Millenium\nEcosystem Assessment\" in 2005,"},"414":{"dur":3,"text":"and then this one is a very\nimportant publication --"},"417":{"dur":4,"text":"TEEB publication, \"The Economics\nof Ecosystems and Biodiversity\","},"423":{"dur":2,"text":"and then descending\nwith the one which kind"},"425":{"dur":1,"text":"of assessed all of the UK."},"427":{"dur":1,"text":"So, this is a little\nbit controversial."},"429":{"dur":4,"text":"George Monbiot, in particular,\nattacked this kind of approach"},"434":{"dur":3,"text":"of valuing nature, thinking that\nif he valued nature you were,"},"437":{"dur":4,"text":"somehow, devaluing it and\nopening up to being sold off."},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"But, personally, I think this\nis a very important approach"},"445":{"dur":4,"text":"in a way you can talk to\npolicymakers about the value"},"450":{"dur":1,"text":"of biodiversity and nature."},"452":{"dur":3,"text":"So, given the importance\nof biodiversity,"},"455":{"dur":3,"text":"it's a real surprise that\nwe don't model it better."},"460":{"dur":4,"text":"So if you think about the IPCC,\nwhich is in the news recently"},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"for bringing out\ntheir latest report."},"467":{"dur":4,"text":"They have these models,\nnot just one set of people,"},"472":{"dur":3,"text":"but they coordinate all of\nthe models across the planet"},"475":{"dur":1,"text":"from a set who's in\ndifferent groups."},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"We don't have anything\nlike that for biodiversity."},"480":{"dur":5,"text":"One of the main reasons\nis that the IPCC use data"},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"from weather stations,\nwhich are, perhaps,"},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"less than a kilometer away\nfrom us, as we're sitting here."},"491":{"dur":4,"text":"So, there are these stations\nacross the world recording"},"495":{"dur":6,"text":"and measuring weather and the\n-- and rain, and sunlight."},"502":{"dur":1,"text":"There's nothing like\nthat for biodiversity,"},"504":{"dur":1,"text":"so if we really want\nto get serious"},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"about modeling what\nbiodiversity's going to do,"},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"and there can be some services\nthat come from biodiversity."},"513":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean, you could -- to\n[inaudible] the information"},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"that we're getting that we need."},"522":{"dur":4,"text":"So, if you think about those\nold Victorian naturalists,"},"526":{"dur":3,"text":"they spent their time collecting\nlots and lots of specimens,"},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"putting them in museums,\nand this an image"},"532":{"dur":3,"text":"from a really exciting\nnew project, and actually,"},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"that's Jimmy saying,\n\"Put on a specimen.\""},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"So, they are trying\nto photograph all"},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"of their specimens -- yeah\n-- all of their specimens;"},"543":{"dur":1,"text":"so there's billions of them."},"544":{"dur":3,"text":"So they're starting off with\nthe butterflies of the UK --"},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"butterflies and moths of the UK\nand this is one of their slides"},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"that they're taking pictures of."},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"So, this just is illustrating\nthat, you know, historically,"},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"we used to document these very\ncarefully, and mash it in,"},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"and kind of put them in\ntrays and take pictures."},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"So now, you know, this\nhas moved on slightly"},"565":{"dur":4,"text":"so that we have organizations\nlike the [inaudible],"},"571":{"dur":4,"text":"or Butterfly Conservation Trust,\nwho engage volunteers to go out"},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"and do some different science\nprojects and monitor wildlife,"},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"so it's a bit better than\na recording, you know,"},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"just capturing things and\nputting them in a museum."},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"So now, we're actually\nmonitoring, in a small way,"},"586":{"dur":3,"text":"using volunteers and -- but it's\nvery patchy across the world,"},"590":{"dur":3,"text":"so there's only some countries\nthat have programs that do this."},"594":{"dur":4,"text":"So, we really need to ramp\nup our monitoring of nature"},"600":{"dur":3,"text":"and I think that these new\ntechnologic advances will be"},"603":{"dur":1,"text":"able to help us do that."},"605":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I'm just going to\ngo through the really --"},"609":{"dur":1,"text":"some of the few things\nthat should --"},"610":{"dur":3,"text":"excited me recently when\nI've been looking into this."},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"So, one of these\nthings is camera traps."},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"So, camera traps have been\nused for a hundred years,"},"620":{"dur":3,"text":"mostly for hunters to\nconfine prey in the woods but,"},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"more recently, they've\nbeen adopted"},"626":{"dur":3,"text":"by the wildlife conservation\nkind of societies"},"629":{"dur":4,"text":"and the research areas too,\nfor us to track wildlife"},"634":{"dur":1,"text":"in the natural environment."},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is an image which\nis taken in Liberia a couple"},"639":{"dur":4,"text":"of years ago; so they set these\ncamera traps out in a grid"},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"across this forest in Liberia,"},"646":{"dur":1,"text":"not knowing what\nthey would catch,"},"648":{"dur":3,"text":"and a pigmy hippo happened\nto come into their frame"},"652":{"dur":1,"text":"and got caught on camera."},"653":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, pigmy hippos haven't been\nfound in Liberia for many, many,"},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"many years and this was\na really exciting event"},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"that the president got\nreally behind and set"},"662":{"dur":3,"text":"that reserve areas\nas a nature reserve."},"666":{"dur":6,"text":"So, the power of these images is\nvery great and can engage people"},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"in different ways than\nwe were used to before."},"676":{"dur":6,"text":"So these cameras are now a\nlittle bit more sophisticated,"},"682":{"dur":5,"text":"so some of them have cellphone\nor satellite receivers in them"},"688":{"dur":4,"text":"so that they can send data\nup to servers held elsewhere;"},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"so this an example from\nZoological Society of London."},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"They have this program\ncalled <i>Instant Wild<\/i>"},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"and they have sets of camera --"},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"groups of cameras all around\nin the nature reserves"},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"that they hold, or\nthat partners --"},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"when they're working with\npartners in different place,"},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"and these images --\nthese cameras take images"},"714":{"dur":4,"text":"and these images are then\nbeamed back to servers we hold"},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"in London, but then\nanyone can access those"},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"and help us identify\nwhat's in there."},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"So, this is opening up different\nworlds and different wildlife"},"727":{"dur":1,"text":"to people that haven't\nseen these things,"},"729":{"dur":1,"text":"that don't have any\nopportunity to do that."},"732":{"dur":3,"text":"So, it's not just a terrestrial\nrealm, this is an example"},"735":{"dur":2,"text":"from one of my PHC students,\nDave Turner [assumed spelling]"},"738":{"dur":5,"text":"and he is trying to see whether\nhe can use cameras underwater"},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"to monitor marine\nprotected areas."},"746":{"dur":2,"text":"So these are new protective\nareas which have been set"},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"up in the marine\nrealm and instead"},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"of how we usually monitor\nthem, which is fishing,"},"755":{"dur":3,"text":"he's tried to see whether\nhe can create new ways"},"758":{"dur":4,"text":"to monitor things\nwith images and video."},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is a video\nthat was taken"},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"in the Chagos Nature\nReserve in the South Pacific."},"778":{"dur":4,"text":"So, not just with cameras,\nbut with other kind"},"783":{"dur":3,"text":"of sensors have become\nfield expanded,"},"787":{"dur":4,"text":"so these can be very small, tiny\ntags that you put on animals,"},"792":{"dur":3,"text":"they can go on their collars,\nor be glued, temporarily,"},"795":{"dur":4,"text":"to their skin with a non-harmful\nglue that comes off --"},"799":{"dur":1,"text":"it can be cleaned off."},"801":{"dur":1,"text":"So, these can be\na range of sizes"},"803":{"dur":3,"text":"and I've given you an\nillustration, here, of something"},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"that you may have seen\nrecently on the BBC,"},"808":{"dur":1,"text":"which is the secret\nlives of cats."},"810":{"dur":3,"text":"So, they put these tags on the\ncats and they also had a camera"},"814":{"dur":1,"text":"on them, and the village in --"},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"I think it was Oxfordshire,\nset these cats."},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"They were just the\nnormal housecats,"},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"[inaudible] old housecats\nand, of course,"},"823":{"dur":2,"text":"the owners were completely\nconvinced"},"825":{"dur":3,"text":"that their cat didn't\nactually go anywhere all day,"},"829":{"dur":3,"text":"just stayed in on the sofa and\nthen saw them in the morning,"},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"but actually, as you can\nsee from here, this is some"},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"of the routes which\nthe cats were taking."},"840":{"dur":1,"text":"Oh, thanks [laughter]."},"843":{"dur":4,"text":"Some of the routes the cats\nwere taking in one evening,"},"848":{"dur":3,"text":"so this is really kind of\nopening people's eyes to,"},"851":{"dur":3,"text":"you know, what the cats\nwere doing while they"},"854":{"dur":0,"text":"weren't looking."},"856":{"dur":4,"text":"So, another kind of example\nis these daily diary types,"},"861":{"dur":3,"text":"which not just recording GPS,\nbut they're actually recording"},"865":{"dur":2,"text":"up and down movement and\nside to side movement,"},"868":{"dur":1,"text":"so this is called\nan accelerometer,"},"870":{"dur":3,"text":"so if you guys have a phone\nand you're playing -- course --"},"873":{"dur":2,"text":"oh, so you wouldn't\nplaying games on your phone,"},"876":{"dur":1,"text":"you're using it for email."},"877":{"dur":2,"text":"What! But, if you were\nplaying a game on your phone"},"880":{"dur":3,"text":"and if you tilt -- if you do\ntilting or anything like that,"},"883":{"dur":2,"text":"then there's an accelerometer\nin here which is recording"},"886":{"dur":1,"text":"that tilt thing;\nthat's exactly what's"},"887":{"dur":3,"text":"in these tags on these animals."},"891":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, as you can see\nfrom the graph, here,"},"894":{"dur":2,"text":"this is showing you,\nin three dimensions,"},"897":{"dur":2,"text":"what the animal is doing."},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can actually use\ndifferent techniques"},"902":{"dur":4,"text":"to associate the actual\ndata that's coming"},"906":{"dur":3,"text":"from these tags to behaviors."},"910":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is revolutionizing\nhow we understand how animals"},"913":{"dur":2,"text":"behave, because you're\ngetting all this information"},"915":{"dur":4,"text":"from these tags."},"920":{"dur":3,"text":"So, this is a huge\narea that's growing"},"923":{"dur":3,"text":"and you can actually look\nat the movement of animals."},"926":{"dur":3,"text":"So this would be animal\nmovement at the [inaudible]"},"930":{"dur":2,"text":"down to South America\nand back again;"},"934":{"dur":1,"text":"up to the northern hemisphere,"},"935":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's actually\nfollowing the animal movement"},"938":{"dur":2,"text":"of [inaudible] across\nthe planet."},"940":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is trying to\nlink animal behavior"},"942":{"dur":3,"text":"to environmental\nvariability across the planet."},"946":{"dur":4,"text":"So, this is a project by\nRobin Freeman, who's at UCL"},"950":{"dur":3,"text":"and the Zoological Society\nof London, so this is one"},"954":{"dur":1,"text":"of his projects,\n[inaudible] the new tag"},"955":{"dur":1,"text":"that he's developed\ncalled 'Mataki'."},"957":{"dur":2,"text":"So, if you're interested,\nlook up Mataki Tags."},"960":{"dur":1,"text":"So, he's got a few projects now"},"962":{"dur":1,"text":"and he's collaborating\non many more."},"966":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I've been interested\nin developing sensors"},"969":{"dur":4,"text":"for a few [inaudible], so using\nthe sounds the animals make"},"974":{"dur":0,"text":"to attract them."},"975":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I'm trying to develop\nmonitoring programs using"},"979":{"dur":2,"text":"sounds, and I've got\nparticular interest in bats;"},"982":{"dur":2,"text":"bet anyone knows\nme will know that."},"984":{"dur":4,"text":"So I been using the\nultrasonic sounds that bats make"},"988":{"dur":2,"text":"to attract them because\nthey leak information"},"990":{"dur":2,"text":"about themselves into\nthe environment and,"},"993":{"dur":3,"text":"as they use this for\nlocation and for navigation;"},"996":{"dur":1,"text":"they use it all the\ntime at night"},"997":{"dur":1,"text":"when they're trying\nto get about."},"999":{"dur":3,"text":"So, it makes a really\nuseful thing that they do,"},"1002":{"dur":2,"text":"which you can then track,\nand track populations."},"1006":{"dur":7,"text":"So, in 2005 we set up the\nfirst acoustic global program"},"1013":{"dur":2,"text":"on monitoring bats."},"1015":{"dur":3,"text":"Bats, of course, we started\nthat in Transylvania,"},"1018":{"dur":2,"text":"Romania because, where else\nwould you start a national"},"1021":{"dur":1,"text":"government issued program,"},"1023":{"dur":1,"text":"international bat\nmonitoring program."},"1025":{"dur":6,"text":"So our idea was to train local\npeople and regional groups"},"1031":{"dur":3,"text":"to understand what bats were\ndoing, how they [inaudible],"},"1034":{"dur":3,"text":"and how to use the equipment\nand how to finalize the data."},"1038":{"dur":3,"text":"So, we provided tools for local\ngroups, who were then empowered"},"1042":{"dur":2,"text":"to do their own thing, you\nknow, ask their own questions"},"1044":{"dur":2,"text":"of the data, which I think\nis a good model to have"},"1047":{"dur":3,"text":"to do conservation\nprojects in other countries."},"1051":{"dur":1,"text":"So, we had a lot of fun."},"1053":{"dur":2,"text":"We did that kind of\n[inaudible] move back"},"1056":{"dur":3,"text":"to [inaudible] Mongolia\nto Japan, so we made a lot"},"1060":{"dur":1,"text":"of friends during\nthat and set up a lot"},"1062":{"dur":2,"text":"of monitoring programs,\nalong the way."},"1065":{"dur":3,"text":"So, the Japanese really like\nit; they love gadgets so,"},"1068":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm not making generalized\nstatements, hopefully,"},"1071":{"dur":1,"text":"but they do love this project."},"1073":{"dur":3,"text":"So, what the actual technique\nis that we've put a detector --"},"1077":{"dur":4,"text":"an acoustic detector on top of\na car, and we get them to drive"},"1081":{"dur":1,"text":"around and set [inaudible]."},"1082":{"dur":4,"text":"So it means that you're\nmonitoring one particular"},"1087":{"dur":4,"text":"habitat in the same way\nacross huge, huge areas,"},"1092":{"dur":3,"text":"which makes you able to\nstandardize all the methods"},"1095":{"dur":1,"text":"across the whole continent."},"1097":{"dur":4,"text":"So, it's actually\nquite tricky to put all"},"1102":{"dur":1,"text":"of this equipment\ntogether and explain it"},"1104":{"dur":3,"text":"in different languages, so we\ncame up with an iPhone app,"},"1109":{"dur":2,"text":"which would enable --\nit could be

record"},"1119":{"dur":2,"text":"that [inaudible] like\nthat to our website."},"1121":{"dur":3,"text":"So we are trying to streamline\nthe collection of data,"},"1124":{"dur":3,"text":"and that's worked very\nwell so we have iPhones"},"1128":{"dur":4,"text":"or android phones\nto collect data,"},"1132":{"dur":2,"text":"by plugging in an acoustic\n[inaudible] into them."},"1135":{"dur":4,"text":"So that was a few\nyears ago, now,"},"1141":{"dur":3,"text":"and since then there's a\nhuge growth in this area"},"1144":{"dur":2,"text":"in smartphone monitoring apps."},"1147":{"dur":3,"text":"So now we've got the iBox one\nthat was also a ladybug one,"},"1151":{"dur":2,"text":"if you want to -- so\nyou can spot ladybugs,"},"1153":{"dur":1,"text":"you want to record them."},"1155":{"dur":3,"text":"AshTag app is a -- it's a\nreally interesting example."},"1159":{"dur":3,"text":"So, when the disease -- the\nAsh fly back disease was found"},"1163":{"dur":5,"text":"in this country, within four\ndays, I think it was, someone --"},"1168":{"dur":3,"text":"some enterprising person\nhad made an app for

amazing."},"1187":{"dur":5,"text":"So you have a kind of evolution\nof these apps now so instead"},"1192":{"dur":1,"text":"of just having them\nfor monitoring,"},"1195":{"dur":1,"text":"you can actually have these keys"},"1197":{"dur":1,"text":"and identifications\non the phone."},"1199":{"dur":3,"text":"So instead of having these books\nyou carry out in the field,"},"1202":{"dur":2,"text":"you just carry out your\niPhone, or smart --"},"1205":{"dur":1,"text":"whatever smartphone you want,"},"1207":{"dur":2,"text":"and it can give you the\nidentifications in the field"},"1210":{"dur":1,"text":"by using interactive keys."},"1212":{"dur":3,"text":"So, interesting ones are the\nFSC, or the Field Study Center,"},"1217":{"dur":5,"text":"guides might have\ndifferent animals and plants"},"1222":{"dur":2,"text":"that you can download as\nseparate little add-ons,"},"1226":{"dur":1,"text":"and a really interesting\none is called"},"1227":{"dur":2,"text":"\"NatureGate\", which\nis just here."},"1230":{"dur":4,"text":"So NatureGate has the keys,\nbut also links you together"},"1235":{"dur":3,"text":"so if you've found something\nand you've identified it"},"1238":{"dur":1,"text":"with the key, you can\ntell your neighbor"},"1240":{"dur":1,"text":"and then you have a map-up"},"1242":{"dur":1,"text":"of where everybody's\nfound everything,"},"1244":{"dur":2,"text":"so it's a really\ninteresting kind of take."},"1246":{"dur":2,"text":"So, using the phone not\njust for its

identifications\nand sightings."},"1257":{"dur":5,"text":"So, this idea that you can\ntake something in the field"},"1262":{"dur":3,"text":"and it would help you\nidentify the species is a very"},"1266":{"dur":0,"text":"powerful one."},"1267":{"dur":4,"text":"So, especially for monitoring,\nit increases the validity"},"1272":{"dur":1,"text":"of the data that\nyou're

never before."},"1283":{"dur":1,"text":"So this idea of identifying\nthings"},"1284":{"dur":2,"text":"in the field is a very\npowerful one and , you know,"},"1286":{"dur":3,"text":"it's a very exciting\nthing to be able to do,"},"1290":{"dur":1,"text":"but we're not very good at it."},"1291":{"dur":2,"text":"So, you've got these\nguides and these ID things"},"1294":{"dur":4,"text":"which people take out, but\nwhat people really want is just"},"1298":{"dur":4,"text":"to point a phone at something\nand to be told what it is,"},"1303":{"dur":1,"text":"so wouldn't that be amazing."},"1305":{"dur":1,"text":"So, we're not there\nyet, but I'm going"},"1306":{"dur":2,"text":"to give you a few examples\nof how this is going."},"1308":{"dur":1,"text":"So, this is \"Icebox\",\nthis is one"},"1310":{"dur":1,"text":"of my favorite websites, ever."},"1312":{"dur":3,"text":"And say if you are in the field\nand you've got the Icebox app,"},"1316":{"dur":2,"text":"you can take a picture if\nyou're not sure what it is,"},"1319":{"dur":2,"text":"and you can upload it\nto the Icebox website,"},"1322":{"dur":3,"text":"and behind this

birds,"},"1332":{"dur":5,"text":"or butterflies, so you\ncan increase in expertise"},"1337":{"dur":5,"text":"and then you can offer\nidentification of this image."},"1343":{"dur":3,"text":"So, then I've seen some stats\nfrom the guy that runs this,"},"1347":{"dur":1,"text":"Jonathan Silatown [assumed\nspelling], and he was saying"},"1348":{"dur":1,"text":"within a half an hour most"},"1350":{"dur":3,"text":"of them are naturally\nidentified, which is crazy."},"1354":{"dur":2,"text":"So, that's a really good way."},"1357":{"dur":3,"text":"So, you're actually getting the\ncrowd to identify your species"},"1360":{"dur":1,"text":"that you'd been finding\nin the fields,"},"1362":{"dur":2,"text":"which is a really good way\nof doing it, but still,"},"1364":{"dur":2,"text":"it's not instant; it's\nnot that instant thing"},"1366":{"dur":1,"text":"that we might be wanting."},"1370":{"dur":6,"text":"So, other ways, other\ndevelopments of this are to try"},"1377":{"dur":2,"text":"to develop algorithms which\nwould do it instantaneously."},"1380":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, this is the idea\nbehind this \"Universe\" website."},"1383":{"dur":1,"text":"So, if you haven't\nhad a look at this,"},"1385":{"dur":1,"text":"you should log on\nand have a look."},"1387":{"dur":2,"text":"So, it was started by a bunch\nof astronomers to start with,"},"1390":{"dur":3,"text":"because they're getting quite a\nbit of data every half-an-hour"},"1394":{"dur":2,"text":"from the CAPSA Space\nField, well, they were,"},"1396":{"dur":3,"text":"so they're getting these\nimages of these galaxies"},"1399":{"dur":4,"text":"and they needed help, your\nhelp, to actually classify them."},"1403":{"dur":4,"text":"So, were very good at some\nof these classification tasks"},"1408":{"dur":2,"text":"and they wanted to\ntrain computers"},"1410":{"dur":1,"text":"to do it in the same way."},"1412":{"dur":3,"text":"So they have these \"Galaxy\nZoo\" which is really cool"},"1416":{"dur":2,"text":"and then this one,\nwhich is another one"},"1419":{"dur":2,"text":"of my favorite ones,\nwhich is [inaudible]."},"1421":{"dur":4,"text":"So, what happens is that you\ngo and become a ship captain,"},"1427":{"dur":2,"text":"and you help them digitize\nall of the ships logs"},"1430":{"dur":2,"text":"which they've been getting\nover the last few centuries."},"1432":{"dur":1,"text":"And the reason they're\ndoing it is"},"1435":{"dur":3,"text":"because our climate

you're actually helping with\nthis site, so you don't have"},"1453":{"dur":2,"text":"to be an expert to be\nengaged in these things."},"1456":{"dur":2,"text":"So, of course, some of us have\ngotten

\"iBats\"."},"1492":{"dur":2,"text":"We've been recording\nthis since 2006,"},"1494":{"dur":3,"text":"and each file is a gigabyte,\nand it's an hour-and-a-half,"},"1498":{"dur":2,"text":"90 minutes,

play the\nrecording, as well."},"1534":{"dur":3,"text":"And then we've got a, kind of\nactive Facebook, and Twitter,"},"1537":{"dur":2,"text":"and all the rest of those\naccounts, so it's just kind"},"1539":{"dur":1,"text":"of social enterprise"},"1541":{"dur":5,"text":"so my student [inaudible] has\nbeen bravely manning the social"},"1546":{"dur":2,"text":"media networks to kind\nof

you want"},"1626":{"dur":1,"text":"to know what bat it was."},"1628":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, so, that is\nthe key question, okay?"},"1631":{"dur":2,"text":"We know social calls\nfrom feeding buzzes"},"1633":{"dur":2,"text":"or from [inaudible]\ncalls; but what bat was it?"},"1635":{"dur":2,"text":"So, this is something\nwhich has been puzzling me"},"1638":{"dur":0,"text":"for a while now."},"1639":{"dur":3,"text":"So how can we tell the\ndifference between these calls?"},"1643":{"dur":4,"text":"And bats range in [inaudible]\nfrequencies from 6 kilohertz"},"1648":{"dur":4,"text":"to over 212, so that's a\ncrazy amount of variation."},"1652":{"dur":3,"text":"And they have all kinds of\ndifferent shapes and sounds,"},"1656":{"dur":1,"text":"so can we develop something?"},"1658":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, we started off with\nEuropean species so I kind"},"1663":{"dur":1,"text":"of grouped them into\ndifferent call shapes,"},"1665":{"dur":2,"text":"here on the left-hand\nside, and they correspond"},"1668":{"dur":2,"text":"to the different kind of\nspecies of bats on the top."},"1671":{"dur":3,"text":"And this gives you a kind of\npercentage-correct figure,"},"1674":{"dur":2,"text":"so what we did is we took a\nslightly different approach"},"1677":{"dur":1,"text":"than Bat Detective."},"1679":{"dur":2,"text":"We got together a\ngroup of people,"},"1681":{"dur":3,"text":"in a kind of a echo bank\ncalled \"Echo Bank\" [inaudible],"},"1685":{"dur":3,"text":"and we asked them to actually\nsend us the things they were"},"1689":{"dur":4,"text":"really sure about; so, a\nreally good library of calls"},"1693":{"dur":2,"text":"that they were really sure that\nthese were from this species,"},"1696":{"dur":4,"text":"and then trained an artificial\nneuro-network to identify these."},"1701":{"dur":1,"text":"So, we're just making\nalgorithms,"},"1703":{"dur":1,"text":"which you could then use"},"1704":{"dur":2,"text":"to automatically detect\nwhat species they were."},"1706":{"dur":4,"text":"So this is kind of showing\nyou what our success was."},"1710":{"dur":1,"text":"So, we've got pretty\ngood success apart"},"1712":{"dur":2,"text":"from these [inaudible] here,\nwhich are my [inaudible] calls."},"1715":{"dur":3,"text":"And if anyone knows anything\nabout European bats, or UK bats,"},"1719":{"dur":1,"text":"these are very, very\ndifficult to identify"},"1721":{"dur":5,"text":"because they all look like this;\nthey all look exactly the same."},"1726":{"dur":3,"text":"So what we're doing now is, with\nstudents and collaborators here"},"1730":{"dur":2,"text":"at UCL, we're trying\nto figure out how best"},"1733":{"dur":3,"text":"to recognize bat calls, so\nthey're using some technologies"},"1736":{"dur":2,"text":"from voice recognition\nsoftware from humans,"},"1740":{"dur":3,"text":"so humans are obviously only\none species, so we need to think"},"1744":{"dur":2,"text":"about how to adapt that\nto a whole set of species."},"1748":{"dur":2,"text":"So what we are working\ntowards then,"},"1751":{"dur":3,"text":"is an automatic identity file\nfor your phone so you'd be able"},"1755":{"dur":3,"text":"to plug in bats,\nacoustic bat detector,"},"1758":{"dur":3,"text":"so these phones are\nadapted to human hearing"},"1761":{"dur":2,"text":"so they can't hear ultrasonics,\nyou'd have to plug something in."},"1765":{"dur":3,"text":"So we're working on a kind\nof cheap version of detector."},"1768":{"dur":1,"text":"And then, you'd be --"},"1770":{"dur":3,"text":"I just threw this out because we\nactually haven't finished it --"},"1774":{"dur":2,"text":"so, the thing would come\nin, the sound would come in,"},"1776":{"dur":1,"text":"and it would record\nit on the phone."},"1778":{"dur":4,"text":"And then deploy these\nalgorithms that we're getting"},"1782":{"dur":3,"text":"from Bat Detective and from\nthe ones who were developed"},"1786":{"dur":2,"text":"for their species ID, and\ngive you identification"},"1789":{"dur":2,"text":"on the phone while\nyou're out in the field"},"1791":{"dur":1,"text":"with the detector in the

alone in this,"},"1803":{"dur":3,"text":"so really exciting developments\nhave been the English version"},"1807":{"dur":3,"text":"of these apps into apps"},"1810":{"dur":2,"text":"which you can do automatic\nidentification on your phone."},"1813":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I talked to you\nbefore about these keys,"},"1816":{"dur":2,"text":"but this one called Leaf\nSnap, you can take a picture"},"1818":{"dur":2,"text":"of a leaf, put it in front of\nyou, and it will tell you --"},"1821":{"dur":3,"text":"it will use the same kind of\nmethods I have just described"},"1824":{"dur":3,"text":"to you, but for leaves,\nand it will give you an ID."},"1828":{"dur":3,"text":"So, at the moment, it's in\nNorth America, but I saw someone"},"1831":{"dur":3,"text":"at the museum, the Natural\nHistory Museum, a few weeks ago."},"1834":{"dur":2,"text":"He was developing\none for the UK."},"1836":{"dur":2,"text":"So, that would be\nreally exciting."},"1839":{"dur":1,"text":"This one is really\n[inaudible] sounds,"},"1840":{"dur":1,"text":"which is called \"Cicado Hunt\"."},"1843":{"dur":5,"text":"So, it was developed by some\nguys down in South Hampton,"},"1848":{"dur":4,"text":"and they listen for a\nsmall section of sound"},"1852":{"dur":3,"text":"and they analyze those calls;\nsame thing as the bats,"},"1856":{"dur":4,"text":"but because cicadas make noises\ndown in lower frequencies,"},"1860":{"dur":2,"text":"you can use the phone,\nand then it tells you"},"1862":{"dur":1,"text":"if there's a cicada present."},"1864":{"dur":3,"text":"So, this is for an endangered\ncicada in the [inaudible] forest"},"1868":{"dur":3,"text":"and so people who are\nonto this app can go out"},"1872":{"dur":3,"text":"and find these calls\n-- find these species."},"1877":{"dur":3,"text":"So I guess, just to finish\nthem; where is this heading?"},"1881":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, I don't know, but\nI guess they're exciting."},"1884":{"dur":3,"text":"So, there are new products\ncoming on all the time."},"1888":{"dur":2,"text":"So, there's a app called \"Google\nGoggles\", that I don't
