But I'm going to give you guys a little story"},"345":{"dur":3,"text":"as to why I think that lesson is so\nimportant. So"},"348":{"dur":3,"text":"I was in marketing for many years. I\nstarted to do things,"},"351":{"dur":3,"text":"nights, weekends. I'm trying to create my\nown business."},"354":{"dur":3,"text":"I wasn't sure what I wanted to do.

I said, look, I\nwant to help people."},"378":{"dur":4,"text":"I want to help them grow their businesses\nand while doing that I want to have a"},"382":{"dur":4,"text":"nice lifestyle. And he said, well, tell\nme how much money you've ever made"},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"online. And I said, well, I created my own"},"389":{"dur":3,"text":"internet product. I've published books. He\nsaid tell me the number."},"392":{"dur":4,"text":"So admittedly I said, at the time\nmaybe I sold something for like"},"396":{"dur":4,"text":"$47 online.

And\nJaz and I don't even know each other."},"430":{"dur":1,"text":"That's what's so crazy."},"432":{"dur":4,"text":"And the reason is because I didn't\nbelieve I could."},"436":{"dur":5,"text":"And he did a webinar with me.

Now why do I tell you that"},"469":{"dur":3,"text":"as young students? I tell you that\nbecause it has nothing to do with the"},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"money."},"474":{"dur":4,"text":"It really doesn't. What it has to do is\nbelief. The reason why I wasn't able to"},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"achieve that outcome, and it could be any\noutcome,"},"481":{"dur":3,"text":"it could be getting an advanced degree.

So tell us your\nstory before"},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"Upward SEO."},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"Testing. Back on."},"584":{"dur":4,"text":"Yeah. So before Upward SEO, again,\nwe only have a few minutes. So"},"589":{"dur":4,"text":"alright. So the quick highlights.\nSo I graduated Mount Olive an '89."},"593":{"dur":4,"text":"I went to Rutgers Business School,\nstayed local."},"597":{"dur":4,"text":"My senior year I went to a professor and\nsaid, I want to be in advertising. He said,"},"602":{"dur":1,"text":"why do you want to be in advertising?"},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"I said, I want to make really cool\ncommercials. And he said, great. I'll set up"},"607":{"dur":0,"text":"an interview."},"608":{"dur":4,"text":"It was that easy. So I said,\nall right. So I went to you a company,"},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"some of you guys may have heard of it called Ogilvy & Mather, which is an"},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"advertising agency."},"617":{"dur":3,"text":"Walked in for the interview. I was sitting\nthere with about 60 people"},"620":{"dur":4,"text":"sweating my you-know-what. I was nervous. I'm wearing a suit. I think"},"625":{"dur":4,"text":"my mom probably made the suit for me. And I get in for the interview"},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"and no joke, the lady says to me,"},"632":{"dur":3,"text":"it's 80 hours a week. We pay $17,000 a year. Do you want the"},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"job? Yes or no?"},"637":{"dur":3,"text":"That was a whole interview. Didn't ask me\nany questions, nothing."},"640":{"dur":3,"text":"And I was like, you're kidding, right?\nShe's like, no. I need to know. I've got a"},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"whole room full of people who want this\njob."},"647":{"dur":3,"text":"And I said, no thank you. And I walked out.\nSo that was the end of my advertising"},"651":{"dur":1,"text":"career."},"652":{"dur":4,"text":"So I went back to the same professor\nwho gave me the sage advice. And I said, well,"},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"here's the deal. I tell him the story."},"658":{"dur":3,"text":"He's like, well, what are you going to do now? I said, I don't know. You're my professor. Can you"},"661":{"dur":1,"text":"tell me what to do?"},"662":{"dur":4,"text":"And he said, well, do what most people do.\nI said, what's that? He said go to grad school."},"667":{"dur":3,"text":"Right? And that's how I got to grad\nschool. And I found a program out at"},"670":{"dur":1,"text":"Northwestern."},"672":{"dur":4,"text":"Back then it was an integrated marketing\ncommunications program, which I highly"},"676":{"dur":1,"text":"recommend."},"677":{"dur":5,"text":"Back then it was one of the first of its\nkind. And I got exposed to advertising, direct marketing."},"682":{"dur":3,"text":"At the time really wasn't internet\nmarketing, but"},"686":{"dur":4,"text":"PR. And I got exposure to all of\nthese different jobs and"},"690":{"dur":3,"text":"all of these different ways to market\nand promote a business."},"693":{"dur":3,"text":"And, again, that was a changing point for\nme because it helped me identify what do"},"697":{"dur":1,"text":"I like, what do I want to be."},"699":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's what's great about marketing.\nYou guys can be a generalist"},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"and do a little bit of everything. You\ncan focus on a specific area, whether"},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"that's branding, or digital marketing,"},"708":{"dur":3,"text":"or public relations, or advertising."},"711":{"dur":3,"text":"So, again, I'm sharing my\nhistory with you"},"714":{"dur":3,"text":"because what you'll find is"},"718":{"dur":3,"text":"all those pieces are important. And you"},"721":{"dur":3,"text":"experience all of these things over time"},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"and that helps you really decide what it is\nyou want to do. So after that I spent some"},"728":{"dur":3,"text":"time in industry. I worked for\neducational software companies running"},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"marketing departments and marketing\nservices and a bunch a boring stuff."},"735":{"dur":4,"text":"And then one day a friend of mine said, hey, my business needs some help. Do you think you"},"739":{"dur":0,"text":"can help me?"},"740":{"dur":3,"text":"And I said, well, what kind of help do you need. He said, I think we need to market better."},"743":{"dur":3,"text":"I said I know something about marketing.\nLet me see if I can help you."},"746":{"dur":3,"text":"So I started helping him and then other\npeople asked for help."},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"And before I knew it I was consulting\nfor a lot of businesses."},"754":{"dur":3,"text":"And I said, you know what, I really enjoy\nthis more than my"},"757":{"dur":5,"text":"7:30 AM to 6:00 PM job that I\ngo to day in day out."},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"And I started my own business."},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"Cool. All the things lead up to one big"},"769":{"dur":3,"text":"pinnacle. And now you have the company Upward SEO."},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"Here's a question that I personally wanted to ask."},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"What does SEO mean? Is that a acronym? Is that a pet name?"},"779":{"dur":4,"text":"Right. So SEO stands for search\nengine optimization."},"783":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's a kind of thing too\nthat if you're in digital marketing you"},"787":{"dur":1,"text":"understand what it is."},"788":{"dur":3,"text":"If you don't it would be foreign."},"792":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think the important thing is"},"795":{"dur":4,"text":"for us, really we spend a lot of time\nin search engine optimization. Now we're kind of"},"799":{"dur":1,"text":"broadening out."},"800":{"dur":3,"text":"One of the things that you guys are going\nstart to hear in the market right now"},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"around branding is reputation\nmanagement, which is the focus of our business"},"808":{"dur":2,"text":"going forward. That's one of the reasons\nwhy we're changing."},"810":{"dur":3,"text":"But basically, how many people\nhere before you buy a product,"},"814":{"dur":3,"text":"before you go to a restaurant, you look\nonline to see what it's all about?"},"817":{"dur":1,"text":"Raise your hand."},"819":{"dur":3,"text":"OK. It's majority of people. Right. That's\nhow we behave"},"823":{"dur":5,"text":"today. So brands, whether you're a large brand or you're a small restaurant"},"828":{"dur":3,"text":"you want to control what is being said\nabout you online. And control is a harsh"},"832":{"dur":2,"text":"word. Maybe you want to be mindful of\nwhat's being said"},"835":{"dur":3,"text":"about you online. And in marketing as\nmarketers"},"838":{"dur":3,"text":"one of our jobs is to help these\nbusinesses look their best"},"842":{"dur":3,"text":"online. So brand management,"},"845":{"dur":3,"text":"reputation management,\nthese are all areas"},"848":{"dur":4,"text":"of marketing that you can get involved\nwith today. And over time they're going to become"},"852":{"dur":1,"text":"more popular"},"854":{"dur":1,"text":"and more prevalent."},"856":{"dur":1,"text":"That's cool. So search"},"857":{"dur":4,"text":"engine optimization, you said? So through Google, Bing, and"},"861":{"dur":0,"text":"stuff like that?"},"862":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's something we can all connect to. I mean, we all use Google"},"864":{"dur":1,"text":"everyday."},"865":{"dur":3,"text":"Show of hands? Google every day? Yeah. Google every day. So"},"869":{"dur":3,"text":"someone who works so closely with it\nand I'm honestly"},"872":{"dur":3,"text":"surprised about the fact that so close\nto home, graduated"},"875":{"dur":4,"text":"my own high school, was able to do all\nthese great things. And looking out"},"880":{"dur":3,"text":"if you were to give them a life advice,\nnot just"},"883":{"dur":2,"text":"entrepreneur, if you were to give them\nlife advice aside from the"},"886":{"dur":1,"text":"keynote speakers"},"887":{"dur":4,"text":"what would life advice be\njust to be great at life?"},"891":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, you pretty much have it."},"895":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, I would say, look, I mean, you\nalways have to be learning. You always have to be"},"898":{"dur":3,"text":"reaching. You have to have goals. You have to have aspirations."},"901":{"dur":3,"text":"The phrase I like to use is fail forward."},"904":{"dur":3,"text":"And, again, I'm kind of reiterating\nsomething that Jaz said slightly"},"907":{"dur":4,"text":"in a different way, but failure is part\nof success."},"911":{"dur":4,"text":"And always keep your wits about you. Stay focused. Stay targeted."},"915":{"dur":3,"text":"Realize that you're gonna look at other\npeople and say I want what they have."},"919":{"dur":3,"text":"Why can't I have it now? Why isn't it\nhappening faster? Well,"},"923":{"dur":3,"text":"when you're ready for things to happen\nin your life they're going to happen. And I"},"926":{"dur":1,"text":"find this true"},"927":{"dur":4,"text":"with marketing, right? So the\nlife advice"},"931":{"dur":3,"text":"really goes back to that value\nequation. So"},"934":{"dur":5,"text":"I've hired and I have fired a\nlot of people in marketing over my career."},"939":{"dur":3,"text":"And I can tell you that the people that\ncreated the most value, that got the"},"943":{"dur":2,"text":"promotions, that got the jobs,"},"945":{"dur":3,"text":"they were the ones who one,\ndifferentiated themselves. I'm going to tell"},"948":{"dur":1,"text":"you a quick little story."},"950":{"dur":4,"text":"Being mindful of time, and the second thing they did"},"954":{"dur":3,"text":"was they always created more value."},"957":{"dur":3,"text":"They showed up early. They stayed late.\nThey volunteered."},"961":{"dur":4,"text":"They took on more jobs. OK? Those are\nthe people that got the promotions, made"},"966":{"dur":0,"text":"the money,"},"967":{"dur":3,"text":"were more fulfilled, had more\nresponsibility. So let me tell you this"},"970":{"dur":1,"text":"quick little story."},"971":{"dur":4,"text":"So I was hiring someone for public\nrelations. And it's just like Til"},"975":{"dur":3,"text":"said, right? Resumes come in. I've got 3 stacks."},"979":{"dur":3,"text":"1 stack that I'm probably not going to\nlook at again, another stack"},"983":{"dur":5,"text":"which is my short list, and then a third\nstack which is in the trash."},"988":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'm getting dozens and dozens and\ndozens of resumes."},"992":{"dur":3,"text":"So I have this one woman call me. She\nspeaking to me in broken English. I can"},"995":{"dur":1,"text":"hardly hear what she's saying. She said,"},"997":{"dur":3,"text":"I sent you a resume. I wanted to follow up. I think I'd be great for this job."},"1000":{"dur":3,"text":"And I kind of put her off because,\nagain, it was a little difficult for me to"},"1004":{"dur":2,"text":"understand her, and in public relations"},"1006":{"dur":5,"text":"you're calling on TV,\nproducers, and you're calling on radio"},"1011":{"dur":2,"text":"stations. And I just didn't think it would\nwork."},"1014":{"dur":3,"text":"So about a week goes by. I get a call from\nthe lobby"},"1017":{"dur":4,"text":"and the receptionist  there says\nChristina Vita is here to see you."},"1021":{"dur":3,"text":"I said, who's Christina Vita? She said,\nwell, she told me she sent a resume"},"1025":{"dur":2,"text":"and she's like a minute of your time."},"1028":{"dur":3,"text":"I thought that was pretty bold. So I said I'll\nbe right up."},"1031":{"dur":4,"text":"So I go up to the front and here I see\nChristina and she's poised"},"1035":{"dur":3,"text":"and confident. And said I sent you a resume and I"},"1038":{"dur":3,"text":"know this is unconventional, but I wanted\nto give this to you. I said, what's this?"},"1042":{"dur":0,"text":"She said"},"1043":{"dur":3,"text":"I researched your company\nand I put together a public relations"},"1046":{"dur":1,"text":"plan"},"1048":{"dur":3,"text":"for you to look at. Oh, that's really\ninteresting."},"1051":{"dur":3,"text":"So anyway, so I said, thank you very much. I shook her hand and"},"1054":{"dur":4,"text":"she went about her way. I went about mine.\nI looked at the plan. It was dynamite."},"1058":{"dur":3,"text":"So guess who I called back for a second\ninterview? Christina Vita."},"1062":{"dur":4,"text":"Guess who I hired? Christina Vita, right."},"1066":{"dur":3,"text":"Right on. But you guys see that this is a\nthread"},"1069":{"dur":4,"text":"that if you understand and apply you're\ngoing to get ahead."},"1073":{"dur":3,"text":"You're going to get ahead in marketing. You're going to get ahead in your jobs. You're going to get ahead in life."},"1077":{"dur":4,"text":"But you get out of it what you put into\nit. So you can't get a fire without the"},"1081":{"dur":1,"text":"wood. So be the fuel."},"1083":{"dur":3,"text":"Make it happen and you're going to get\ngreat results. You're going to be really happy."},"1087":{"dur":3,"text":"All right. I think we have a lot to learn from Mr. Fleischner's life and all his life"},"1090":{"dur":2,"text":"lessons. So I would like to give him a round of applause for just being great."},"1093":{"dur":2,"text":"Great. Thank you, everybody."},"1098":{"dur":2,"text":"But not only that, I mean"},"1100":{"dur":3,"text":"if you look around this room, we\nlook at ourselves and we say,"},"1103":{"dur":3,"text":"how can we put that\nlife equation into practice? How can we"},"1107":{"dur":1,"text":"go out and get it"},"1109":{"dur":3,"text":"sort of speak? Because\nChristina Vita"},"1112":{"dur":3,"text":"was bold and she was able to come out there and be"},"1116":{"dur":3,"text":"completely different than everybody else. How can we be that different person and"},"1119":{"dur":1,"text":"be able to succeed that way?"},"1121":{"dur":3,"text":"Those books are staring me in the\nface. So I'm not sure what you want to do with those."},"1124":{"dur":3,"text":"Yes. Let's see. Are there any\nquestions that you guys have?"},"1127":{"dur":3,"text":"And it can be pretty much about anything."},"1131":{"dur":4,"text":"This young lady here in the front."},"1135":{"dur":3,"text":"The question was what businesses\nhave I consulted with."},"1138":{"dur":4,"text":"And truthfully, all different industries,\nall different sizes."},"1142":{"dur":3,"text":"For example, a client today"},"1146":{"dur":4,"text":"is more of a B2B and I know Tom is going to be talking about B2C and B2B later."},"1150":{"dur":3,"text":"But a B2B company called navigation.com, so"},"1154":{"dur":4,"text":"if you I drive a fancy schmancy car\nand you've got navigation"},"1158":{"dur":4,"text":"they're the ones who make all the\nmaps and all the map updates."},"1162":{"dur":3,"text":"Google happens to be one of their\ncustomers. So"},"1166":{"dur":4,"text":"this is a big national organization and\nits one most people have never heard of."},"1170":{"dur":3,"text":"So sometimes companies like that to\nmore popular brands."},"1174":{"dur":3,"text":"I've done some things in the retail\nindustry. I've done things"},"1178":{"dur":5,"text":"in insurance. So all \nnames that you guys would know. And I've done"},"1183":{"dur":4,"text":"some for small businesses. Right now I'm\nconsulting for a company called Caliper."},"1187":{"dur":4,"text":"And they do you human resource\nassessments. So when you guys go for a job"},"1192":{"dur":2,"text":"and they make you take a little\npersonality test,"},"1194":{"dur":3,"text":"they produce the tests. So all these\ncompanies,"},"1197":{"dur":3,"text":"unless you work for the\ngovernment and you have one customer, which"},"1201":{"dur":1,"text":"is the government,"},"1202":{"dur":4,"text":"they need marketing. So you guys are\nin the right place."},"1206":{"dur":5,"text":"Any other questions?"},"1212":{"dur":3,"text":"Great question. Are there any\nbusinesses that I would love to do"},"1215":{"dur":1,"text":"business with"},"1216":{"dur":4,"text":"in the future? I would say right now I\nthink one of the most interesting areas"},"1221":{"dur":1,"text":"are these companies that produce"},"1223":{"dur":3,"text":"apps, right? And there are a lot of\ncompanies doing that right now."},"1226":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think there's going to be some\nconsolidation in that market. So I would"},"1230":{"dur":3,"text":"love to spend some time there because I\nthink I'd learn a great deal in addition"},"1233":{"dur":0,"text":"to being able"},"1234":{"dur":3,"text":"to share my knowledge. Great\nquestion. Thank you."},"1237":{"dur":4,"text":"Thought I saw one more hand over back\nthere."},"1245":{"dur":3,"text":"So I believe what I heard was did I\naccomplish anything that I thought was"},"1248":{"dur":1,"text":"not possible"},"1250":{"dur":3,"text":"initially? Yeah. So"},"1253":{"dur":5,"text":"I think that happens less\nfrequently because I am more confident"},"1258":{"dur":1,"text":"in my abilities"},"1260":{"dur":3,"text":"as not just in myself, but as I develop a\nteam. So"},"1264":{"dur":3,"text":"in thinking about it it's hard to put\nmy finger on any one thing, but I would"},"1267":{"dur":0,"text":"say"},"1268":{"dur":3,"text":"the lesson I got from that\nwas going back to what we said earlier,"},"1271":{"dur":1,"text":"believe that you can do it."},"1273":{"dur":4,"text":"So if you don't think you can do it\nstart getting with people who have done it"},"1277":{"dur":3,"text":"to build up your confidence, learn how\nthey do it, and it becomes more approachable."},"1281":{"dur":4,"text":"And then the second thing too is be\nvery choosing and careful about who you work with"},"1286":{"dur":2,"text":"and who you network with. I was talking to a group, we were at a trade show,"},"1291":{"dur":3,"text":"and someone brought up LinkedIn. And I\nsaid, yeah, I don't connect with people"},"1294":{"dur":4,"text":"unless they have at least 500\nconnections on LinkedIn. And the room"},"1299":{"dur":3,"text":"just like that, went silent. Because"},"1302":{"dur":3,"text":"one person said, I don't even\nremember. It was gentleman. Raises his hand and he said,"},"1305":{"dur":1,"text":"well, don't you think that's a little"},"1307":{"dur":3,"text":"egotistical or whatever he said? And I\nsaid,"},"1311":{"dur":3,"text":"actually, no. I don't. My goal is to\nconnect with more people."},"1315":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's say there were 500 people out there, each"},"1318":{"dur":1,"text":"with one connection."},"1319":{"dur":4,"text":"I'd have to connect with all 500,\nbut if I can find one person with 500"},"1323":{"dur":2,"text":"connections I just have to connect with the\none."},"1325":{"dur":3,"text":"Right? So it all comes down to"},"1328":{"dur":3,"text":"perspective, philosophy, and there's no\nright or wrong. I think that's the other"},"1332":{"dur":2,"text":"thing. When you think about\nthings that you don't think you can"},"1334":{"dur":1,"text":"accomplish,"},"1335":{"dur":6,"text":"but you kind of go for it anyway.\nAre you making progress towards your goal?"},"1342":{"dur":5,"text":"And I call that progress, not perfection.

And"},"1352":{"dur":3,"text":"you guys being here is\nrepresentative of taking action."},"1355":{"dur":4,"text":"Right? Not all the pieces are in place.\nYou're early in your careers. You're"},"1360":{"dur":3,"text":"early in your education. And you're\ntaking steps forward. And for that"},"1363":{"dur":3,"text":"I applaud you guys. And I would say\ncontinue in that vein."},"1366":{"dur":0,"text":"And take action is"},"1367":{"dur":1,"text":"what we will do. Thank you, Mr. Fleischner."},"1368":{"dur":4,"text":"Great.
