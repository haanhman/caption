use self-watering\npots, such as this."},"16":{"dur":3,"text":"It's actually very easy and inexpensive\nto make one,"},"20":{"dur":3,"text":"so in this video we'll show you how - step-by-step."},"23":{"dur":5,"text":"You'll need two containers which, when stacked,\nwill leave a gap between the bottom and top containers."},"29":{"dur":2,"text":"The gap will serve as your water reservoir."},"31":{"dur":3,"text":"If there isn't enough of a gap you can\nuse some plastic pots"},"34":{"dur":2,"text":"to raise the top container up a little more."},"37":{"dur":4,"text":"We're using two 5-gallon (20 liter)\nfood-grade plastic buckets."},"41":{"dur":5,"text":"You can often pick these up for free from restaurants, \nor very cheaply from home improvement stores."},"46":{"dur":3,"text":"You'll also need a one and a half inch (3cm)\ndiameter plastic pipe"},"50":{"dur":2,"text":"long enough to run the length of the two\nbuckets,"},"53":{"dur":3,"text":"a plastic cup, yogurt pot or similar to act as a wicking chamber"},"57":{"dur":3,"text":"and of course some quality potting soil\nand your plants."},"61":{"dur":2,"text":"Start by preparing the\nwicking chamber."},"64":{"dur":3,"text":"This should dangle down from the top\nbucket into the bottom."},"67":{"dur":5,"text":"Stuffed with potting soil, it will draw or wick water\nfrom the reservoir up into the top bucket."},"73":{"dur":4,"text":"Use a marker pen to trace an outline\nof the pot onto the middle of the top bucket."},"78":{"dur":1,"text":"Now cut it out."},"79":{"dur":2,"text":"You can use a keyhole saw\nor a hacksaw for this."},"82":{"dur":5,"text":"Here I'm using a drill to make lots of small holes so I\ncan use a sharp knife to cut the plastic out."},"88":{"dur":3,"text":"The wicking

these."},"98":{"dur":1,"text":"Now for the water delivery\npipe."},"100":{"dur":4,"text":"Begin by cutting one end of your plastic pipe at a 45-degree angle like this."},"105":{"dur":4,"text":"This will allow the water to freely flow\nfrom the pipe into the reservoir without getting blocked."},"110":{"dur":3,"text":"Cut the top end so it\nstands clear of the final soil level."},"114":{"dur":4,"text":"Now cut a hole into the bottom of the\ntop bucket so the pipe can pass into the reservoir."},"119":{"dur":4,"text":"Make sure it's snug fit by\ntracing the outline then cutting to size."},"125":{"dur":3,"text":"The top bucket will need some drainage\nholes for healthy root growth."},"128":{"dur":3,"text":"Drill lots of quarter-inch or 5mm holes\ninto its base."},"132":{"dur":3,"text":"You can go for a random pattern or an\norderly effects such as this."},"137":{"dur":5,"text":"Stack the top bucket into the bottom bucket, then\nmark off using a pen where the top buckets sits."},"143":{"dur":6,"text":"Remove the top bucket and drill a quarter-inch (5mm)\nhole into the bottom bucket just below this line."},"150":{"dur":5,"text":"This will serve as an overflow hole, so the potting soil in the top bucket never gets waterlogged."},"155":{"dur":3,"text":"It also removes any guesswork from\nfilling the reservoir -"},"159":{"dur":3,"text":"just stop when the water starts to drain\nout from the overflow."},"163":{"dur":2,"text":"Now it's time to assemble the container."},"165":{"dur":3,"text":"Insert the top bucket into the bottom\nbucket."},"168":{"dur":4,"text":"Fill the wicking chamber with potting soil, firming it in for good contact,"},"172":{"dur":2,"text":"then slot the chamber snugly into its\nhole."},"175":{"dur":3,"text":"Slide the water delivery pipe into place, pointy end down."},"180":{"dur":4,"text":"Fill the top bucket with\npotting soil, moistening with water as you fill."},"184":{"dur":4,"text":"You can plant several plants into the top bucket\naccording to their spacing requirements,"},"189":{"dur":3,"text":"or set one plant such as a tomato at\nthe center."},"193":{"dur":4,"text":"This allows you to cover up the\nremaining soil surface, which will reduce evaporation -"},"197":{"dur":2,"text":"especially important in\nhotter climates."},"200":{"dur":4,"text":"Use a lid for this, cutting appropriate holes to accommodate the plant and the pipe."},"205":{"dur":2,"text":"Alternatively you can use a thick garbage bag,"},"208":{"dur":3,"text":"secured at the sides with rubber bands, a bungee cord, or string."},"212":{"dur":3,"text":"You could also add a shallow ring of\norganic fertilizer around the plant."},"216":{"dur":4,"text":"The moist potting soil will gradually draw\nthe nutrients down into the soil to feed the plant's roots."},"222":{"dur":4,"text":"This is a fantastically elegant solution\nto daily watering,"},"227":{"dur":3,"text":"and you can always add additional self-watering containers as time allows."},"231":{"dur":4,"text":"Please share your tips for
