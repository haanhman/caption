at"},"4214":{"dur":1,"text":"is exactly this\nmonitoring assessment."},"4216":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's quite difficult for\nme to answer that question"},"4218":{"dur":2,"text":"right now, but hopefully\nthis time next year,"},"4221":{"dur":2,"text":"I will be able to\nhave an idea of that."},"4223":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah, keep in touch."},"4225":{"dur":1,"text":"But that's something\nthat is important"},"4227":{"dur":2,"text":"because I can give\npresentations like this,"},"4230":{"dur":3,"text":"and I think people engage\nwith what we're doing."},"4233":{"dur":2,"text":"But what is the impact,\nand that's something now"},"4236":{"dur":2,"text":"we really need."},"4238":{"dur":2,"text":"I think to further\nour projects we really"},"4240":{"dur":3,"text":"need to kind of tackle\nthat and see what that is."},"4244":{"dur":3,"text":"So sorry, I don't have an\nanswer for that right now."},"4247":{"dur":3,"text":"[INAUDIBLE] presentation, your\nwork is very, very

aware"},"4257":{"dur":2,"text":"of how you engage\nwith these issues."},"4260":{"dur":2,"text":"But I was wondering if\nyou've had any problems"},"4262":{"dur":3,"text":"with the people who you're\nwriting about or portraying,"},"4265":{"dur":2,"text":"if they've asked you\nto take anything down"},"4268":{"dur":3,"text":"or if they've asked\nyou to modify anything?"},"4271":{"dur":4,"text":"And, kind of, how do you hold\nyourself accountable to that?"},"4276":{"dur":5,"text":"No, is the easy\nanswer for that--"},"4281":{"dur":1,"text":"which is quite a humorous story."},"4282":{"dur":3,"text":"The only issue that\nwe had of modification"},"4286":{"dur":4,"text":"was a Somali woman\nin Lester, Shamso,"},"4290":{"dur":4,"text":"who's this wonderful woman,\nmother of six children."},"4295":{"dur":3,"text":"And the artist drew\nher in [INAUDIBLE],"},"4299":{"dur":3,"text":"and she worked in a samosa shop."},"4302":{"dur":1,"text":"And through the\ninterview, she was"},"4304":{"dur":3,"text":"saying she makes three somosas,\nand she eats one somosa."},"4307":{"dur":3,"text":"And the artist drew her\nwith quite substantial hips,"},"4311":{"dur":3,"text":"and she kind of asked for those\nto be calmed down a little bit."},"4315":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that was a slightly\ninteresting process"},"4318":{"dur":1,"text":"that we went\nthrough, and I think"},"4319":{"dur":2,"text":"she was kind of being\na bit tongue in cheek."},"4322":{"dur":2,"text":"But because of\nthose methodologies"},"4324":{"dur":3,"text":"that we go through of working\nwith people and that back"},"4327":{"dur":5,"text":"and forth, I think there are\na lot of checks and balances"},"4333":{"dur":1,"text":"there before something goes out."},"4335":{"dur":3,"text":"And I really can't\nthink of anything"},"4338":{"dur":4,"text":"where we've had any\nissues from any

know?"},"4426":{"dur":0,"text":"Thanks."},"4427":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah?"},"4428":{"dur":3,"text":"[INAUDIBLE] but my question was\nthat-- you talk a little bit"},"4432":{"dur":1,"text":"about."},"4434":{"dur":1,"text":"Because you're\ncommissioned by a lot"},"4436":{"dur":1,"text":"of these NGOs or\ninternational

ever"},"4450":{"dur":3,"text":"had any conflict with\nthem regarding that,"},"4453":{"dur":2,"text":"or how much do they\nactually see the process,"},"4456":{"dur":6,"text":"or do they only see the

organizations"},"4469":{"dur":3,"text":"that we've worked for,\nhave been really hands off,"},"4473":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's been wonderful."},"4475":{"dur":2,"text":"The Norwegians, by\nfar, being the best."},"4477":{"dur":2,"text":"It's just, like, you\nknow, here's the budget."},"4480":{"dur":2,"text":"Here's what we need you to do."},"4482":{"dur":1,"text":"You're the experts\nin making

work"},"4499":{"dur":3,"text":"with because we\nneed to be creative,"},"4503":{"dur":2,"text":"and lots of these organizations,\njust, their bureaucracy"},"4506":{"dur":1,"text":"is not creative."},"4507":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's going to\nbe quite difficult."},"4510":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm sure you can imagine\nwho might be talking about."},"4514":{"dur":5,"text":"And so we go through those\nprocesses that can be"},"4519":{"dur":3,"text":"challenging, but, by far, the\nmajority of organizations that"},"4522":{"dur":3,"text":"we're working with have\nseen our

got."},"4557":{"dur":2,"text":"These are the stories we've got."},"4559":{"dur":2,"text":"Which story are we going to use?"},"4562":{"dur":4,"text":"And so then, yeah, we go\nthrough that process with them."},"4566":{"dur":2,"text":"And the majority of\nclients have been"},"4569":{"dur":2,"text":"pretty hands off and\njust let us produce,"},"4571":{"dur":2,"text":"but we keep a very, very\nclose
