campaign and about\nthe university's priorities"},"26":{"dur":1,"text":"for students right now."},"27":{"dur":1,"text":"So, Peter, is our\nvice chancellor,"},"29":{"dur":1,"text":"and Debbie, you're\nthe head of marketing"},"30":{"dur":1,"text":"behind this whole campaign."},"32":{"dur":2,"text":"So I wanted to talk about what\nwas important for students."},"35":{"dur":1,"text":"What is the university\ntrying to do"},"36":{"dur":2,"text":"in terms of recruiting\nand enabling more"},"38":{"dur":1,"text":"students into our community?"},"40":{"dur":1,"text":"So much has been happening\nin the HE sector,"},"42":{"dur":1,"text":"and I know you, Peter,\nhave been campaigning"},"44":{"dur":0,"text":"for a lot of changes."},"45":{"dur":2,"text":"So can you fill us in\nbroadly on what's happening?"},"47":{"dur":2,"text":"PETER HORROCKS: Well, in the\nbroader sense, in relating it"},"50":{"dur":2,"text":"to the campaign, we know\nthat students are looking"},"53":{"dur":1,"text":"for help with employment."},"55":{"dur":2,"text":"They're looking for either\na promotion within jobs"},"57":{"dur":2,"text":"or they're looking,\npotentially, to change jobs."},"59":{"dur":2,"text":"This is about 3\/4\nof our students"},"61":{"dur":2,"text":"are looking for\nthat kind of help."},"63":{"dur":1,"text":"In order to be able\nto do that, you"},"65":{"dur":2,"text":"need to have a\nlot of motivation."},"68":{"dur":2,"text":"So when we researched\nwith students"},"70":{"dur":2,"text":"and our potential\nstudents, we asked them"},"72":{"dur":2,"text":"about what the barriers\nwere to them being"},"75":{"dur":2,"text":"able to achieve their goals."},"77":{"dur":3,"text":"So actually having that\nsense of aspiration"},"81":{"dur":2,"text":"and that belief in\nyourself to want to do it"},"83":{"dur":2,"text":"is what you need to go\non to be successful."},"86":{"dur":1,"text":"And we know that\nthe Open University"},"88":{"dur":2,"text":"can help people to be\nsuccessful in their careers."},"91":{"dur":3,"text":"So that was sort of the simple\nconcept of the campaign."},"94":{"dur":2,"text":"And Debbie was the\nmastermind behind it,"},"96":{"dur":1,"text":"and she can say more about that."},"98":{"dur":2,"text":"But I suppose what it\nfits into in a broader"},"100":{"dur":4,"text":"picture across higher education\nis that as jobs get tighter,"},"105":{"dur":2,"text":"as jobs change\nrapidly, as people are"},"108":{"dur":2,"text":"more aware of the\nskills that they need,"},"110":{"dur":1,"text":"they're turning to\neducation in a more"},"112":{"dur":3,"text":"specific way, for support\nfor employability,"},"115":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's something which the\nuniversity is responding to,"},"118":{"dur":2,"text":"by changes to our\ncurriculum, introducing"},"120":{"dur":2,"text":"new things such as degree and\nhigh-level apprenticeships,"},"123":{"dur":2,"text":"and a whole range\nof ways in which we"},"125":{"dur":3,"text":"want to support our students in\ntheir employment aspirations."},"129":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: There\nhave been loads"},"131":{"dur":1,"text":"of initiatives\ngoing on that I've"},"132":{"dur":1,"text":"been aware of very recently."},"133":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, Alison Green\ncame on to actually poll"},"136":{"dur":3,"text":"our students about some areas\naround the creative industries"},"139":{"dur":2,"text":"and say, should we be developing\ncurriculum in this way."},"142":{"dur":1,"text":"We've been looking\nat various things"},"143":{"dur":2,"text":"around apprenticeships,\nand all these initiatives."},"145":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, I know that the\nFaculty of Business and Law"},"147":{"dur":1,"text":"have got this pro bono\nclinic that they're doing."},"149":{"dur":1,"text":"So there are really\nspecific ways"},"151":{"dur":2,"text":"in which the Open University\nis actually shifting"},"153":{"dur":2,"text":"with this dynamic environment."},"155":{"dur":2,"text":"But you've touched on this\nidea about believing in things."},"158":{"dur":2,"text":"And Debbie, I wondered,\nwhat's the connection"},"160":{"dur":1,"text":"between these three things?"},"161":{"dur":2,"text":"Is there a stage that\nwas behind this campaign,"},"164":{"dur":2,"text":"in terms of having this\nidea to change career"},"167":{"dur":2,"text":"and then believing, and doing\nit, and then succeeding?"},"169":{"dur":1,"text":"Is it that simple."},"170":{"dur":0,"text":"DEBBIE BRITTON: Yeah."},"171":{"dur":2,"text":"So, what came behind\nthis campaign was really,"},"174":{"dur":1,"text":"there's two facets to it."},"175":{"dur":4,"text":"One is we know that students go\non a really emotional journey,"},"180":{"dur":3,"text":"both in terms of deciding\nthat they're going to study,"},"183":{"dur":1,"text":"and then going through it."},"184":{"dur":2,"text":"And we wanted to capture\nthat, but capture it"},"187":{"dur":1,"text":"in a really confident way."},"189":{"dur":3,"text":"We thought it's real\ntime that the OU shouted"},"192":{"dur":5,"text":"about how solid and confident\nour students are once they've"},"198":{"dur":2,"text":"made that decision and they're\ngoing through that journey."},"200":{"dur":4,"text":"It's a fantastic initiative."},"204":{"dur":1,"text":"And we wanted to capture\nthat in some way."},"206":{"dur":1,"text":"So that was number one."},"207":{"dur":2,"text":"But the second part\nwas that there's also,"},"210":{"dur":2,"text":"we're conscious that we need\nthe facts and figures behind it."},"213":{"dur":4,"text":"So we want to really\nshow that it's worthwhile"},"217":{"dur":3,"text":"and that employers\nreally value OU students."},"221":{"dur":3,"text":"And the research that\nwas done actually"},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"made sure that that is so true."},"227":{"dur":3,"text":"So something like\n86% of employers"},"230":{"dur":2,"text":"really value the\nskills that OU students"},"233":{"dur":2,"text":"bring to their employment."},"235":{"dur":3,"text":"So it was bringing those\ntwo dimensions together"},"239":{"dur":4,"text":"in a really vibrant way that\nwas at the heart of this."},"243":{"dur":3,"text":"And also, the way\nthat we displayed it."},"246":{"dur":5,"text":"So we already use a lot\nof digital advertising,"},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"but we wanted to shout\nabout it a bit more."},"254":{"dur":3,"text":"So we've taken lots\nof poster sites."},"257":{"dur":3,"text":"We've had a cinema\nad that's really"},"261":{"dur":3,"text":"captured the heroes, some of our\nstudents, and the case studies"},"265":{"dur":1,"text":"that we've got."},"267":{"dur":3,"text":"So all of that\ncombined together,"},"270":{"dur":3,"text":"hopefully, has made a\nreally impactful campaign."},"273":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: It is\nreally impactful."},"274":{"dur":2,"text":"PETER HORROCKS: I was driving\nalong the elevated section"},"277":{"dur":4,"text":"of the M4

as well."},"288":{"dur":1,"text":"It's very violet."},"289":{"dur":1,"text":"PETER HORROCKS:\nMore of the pink."},"291":{"dur":3,"text":"That this is the new badge\nfor the OU's 50th

the badge."},"306":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: A first."},"307":{"dur":1,"text":"But it's nice for\npeople, like you say,"},"309":{"dur":1,"text":"to recognise\nsomething and see

OU journey."},"316":{"dur":1,"text":"But there's this idea,\nyou know, of seeing an OU"},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"book on a train, or seeing\nsomething that you identify"},"320":{"dur":1,"text":"as being part of a community."},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"I appreciate this is trying\nto attract new students"},"324":{"dur":1,"text":"to the Open University,\nbut how nice is it"},"326":{"dur":3,"text":"for our students to see the\nOU being so visible out there?"},"329":{"dur":1,"text":"PETER HORROCKS:\nAnd it's something"},"331":{"dur":3,"text":"which also is felt by the\nOpen University staff, who"},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"are obviously people who work\nall the way across the country,"},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"particularly our tutors, who\nour students will know so well."},"339":{"dur":2,"text":"So something which connects\nthe whole community together."},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"So whether it's our\nstaff, whether it's"},"344":{"dur":2,"text":"potential students, whether\nit's our current students, who"},"347":{"dur":2,"text":"are of course the people\nwho matter most, and then"},"349":{"dur":3,"text":"past students, our\nalumni, we are a community"},"353":{"dur":3,"text":"of more than two million people\nwho've studied with the OU."},"357":{"dur":2,"text":"And that sense of\nconnecting people together"},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"with something which\nthey can believe in,"},"361":{"dur":3,"text":"because it's talking about\nbelief in what the OU can do."},"365":{"dur":2,"text":"I hope people find it really\ninspiring and unifying."},"368":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: It is\ninspiring, in particular,"},"370":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, some of these\nvideos that are on Facebook."},"372":{"dur":1,"text":"And Debbie, you'd mentioned\nsome of these cases studies."},"373":{"dur":1,"text":"So you've got both\na combination,"},"375":{"dur":4,"text":"I guess, of very graphic,\nvisual concepts followed up"},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"And you've done so much\nin terms of research,"},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"in terms of people being\nunhappy at work, people"},"385":{"dur":1,"text":"wanting to change careers, etc."},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"But combined with these\nwonderful case studies that"},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"give a flavour of what it's\nlike to be an OU student,"},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"and what it's like to change\nlives, it's really impactful."},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"How did you go about finding\nsome of those case studies"},"397":{"dur":4,"text":"and what sorts of people do you\nthink are typical OU students?"},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"DEBBIE BRITTON: So how\ndid we go about finding?"},"404":{"dur":2,"text":"There's hundreds,\nthere's hundreds"},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"of heroes out there,\nthousands of heroes"},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"that I'd really want\nto unearth and use"},"411":{"dur":2,"text":"as part of this whole campaign."},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"And what we wanted\nto do was really"},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"try and be as\nrepresentative as we can,"},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"because there is no\ntypical OU student."},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"Everybody has their\nown individual story"},"425":{"dur":4,"text":"about how they've engaged and\nwhat they're doing with the OU."},"429":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, a couple for me that\nreally stick out in my mind"},"433":{"dur":3,"text":"is Dawn, who has\nlocked-in syndrome."},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"And so she studied\nwith us, and she"},"440":{"dur":5,"text":"can type three words a minute\nusing her left eye connected"},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"to her equipment."},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"Just an amazing\nstory that really"},"449":{"dur":3,"text":"pulls on me very, very hard."},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"And then on the\nother hand, you've"},"455":{"dur":7,"text":"got so many cases of people\nwho just haven't been properly"},"463":{"dur":3,"text":"supported through school,\nor end up not believing they"},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"can do something."},"470":{"dur":4,"text":"And Victoria is another\nexample, and she ended up"},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"being the cinema ad."},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"And apparently, she's starting\nto get recognised in the street"},"480":{"dur":4,"text":"now, tapped on the shoulder,\nwhich is just amazing."},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"And she thinks\nthat's really funny."},"486":{"dur":3,"text":"But Victoria had lots\nof naysayers at school."},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, she wasn't encouraged."},"493":{"dur":4,"text":"And she decided not to give\nup, and she came back to study."},"498":{"dur":4,"text":"And you know, how many stories\ndo we hear like that, just"},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"by dint of how you've\ngone through school"},"505":{"dur":1,"text":"or been brought up?"},"506":{"dur":4,"text":"And so she went on and got her\ndegree, and she's now teaching."},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's just an amazing story."},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"It might feel ordinary,\nbut it's extraordinary."},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: And there are so\nmany Open University students"},"518":{"dur":1,"text":"who have these\ndifferent backgrounds."},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, Peter, you've\nbeen a student."},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"You not only run the\nuniversity, but you've also"},"525":{"dur":4,"text":"done some introductory maths and\nstatistics modules, I believe."},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"PETER HORROCKS: One module."},"531":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Did you\npass, by the way?"},"533":{"dur":0,"text":"PETER HORROCKS: I did."},"534":{"dur":0,"text":"I did."},"535":{"dur":0,"text":"PETER HORROCKS: I\nwas very relieved."},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Because\nyou have been busy."},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"And you've been busy campaigning\nabout different things."},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, you know, whilst\nthere were these challenges,"},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"in terms of students actually\ncompleting their degrees"},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"and doing their\nmodules, there are also"},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"other challenges within\nthe wider HE sector,"},"549":{"dur":3,"text":"in terms of funding and\nvarious ways around things."},"553":{"dur":1,"text":"You're doing a lot\naround that area."},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"Is there anything you can tell\nus that you're particularly"},"556":{"dur":1,"text":"campaigning for right now?"},"558":{"dur":1,"text":"PETER HORROCKS: It's\nall about responding"},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"to the need for\nflexibility that people"},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"who are learning at the\nsame time as they're"},"565":{"dur":3,"text":"living their lives and\nliving their working lives."},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is particularly to\ndo with policies in England,"},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"but there are also changes\nthat we're hoping to see,"},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"and improvements we want to\nsee, in other parts of the UK."},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"So for instance, in\nWales yesterday, there"},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"was a report on the future\nof how higher education will"},"582":{"dur":0,"text":"be funded."},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"And that included a really\nsignificant extra commitment"},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"to supporting\npart-time students,"},"587":{"dur":1,"text":"which we really welcome."},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"In England, which is the\nlargest part of the UK,"},"591":{"dur":3,"text":"obviously, we're looking for\nmore flexibility about loans."},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"So for instance, for\nloans for second degrees,"},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"it's only certain subjects\nin science and technology"},"600":{"dur":1,"text":"where you can get a second loan."},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"We're saying that should\nbecome more widespread."},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"So you talked about\nAlison and arts."},"607":{"dur":3,"text":"At the moment, you\ncan't get a loan"},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"for a second degree\nin an art subject"},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"or a humanities subject,\nso that kind of thing."},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"Loans that are available for\nshorter study, so you don't"},"618":{"dur":5,"text":"need to be doing a full degree,\nand also trying to encourage"},"623":{"dur":4,"text":"the government to pay for really\nimproved information for people"},"627":{"dur":0,"text":"to know where to go."},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you're

things that we're"},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"trying to encourage\nthe government"},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"to do to support lifelong\nlearning, which it's committed"},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"to, but which the policies\naren't quite there in place"},"651":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Absolutely."},"652":{"dur":1,"text":"And if you're\ninterested in a session"},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"that we did

about that side of things?"},"791":{"dur":0,"text":"DEBBIE BRITTON: Yeah."},"792":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think the research that we\ndid showed that it's not just"},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"about the
