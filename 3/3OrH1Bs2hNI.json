do."},"52":{"dur":3,"text":"And then, when you read\nit, you just felt wretched."},"56":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think the\nreason for that was"},"57":{"dur":3,"text":"that you realized that if\nyou were going to approach it"},"60":{"dur":3,"text":"again, because there was this\naffection for the original,"},"64":{"dur":4,"text":"that it's sustained, that\npeople would be

a kind of\na medical emergency which"},"144":{"dur":1,"text":"gave him a bit of a crisis."},"146":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's the focus\npart of the film."},"148":{"dur":2,"text":"It's what triggers

is really--"},"161":{"dur":1,"text":"part of making the\nfilm was realizing"},"162":{"dur":1,"text":"what the first film was about."},"164":{"dur":1,"text":"Because we didn't really

that."},"169":{"dur":2,"text":"But actually, the first\nfilm is a study of energy"},"172":{"dur":2,"text":"and youthhood or\nboyhood, if you like,"},"174":{"dur":1,"text":"is a better way of putting it."},"176":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is actually\nabout the transition"},"179":{"dur":3,"text":"and how badly men make\nit to manhood really."},"182":{"dur":1,"text":"That's sort of what\nit's about, really."},"184":{"dur":4,"text":"And we learned while\nmaking it how much--"},"189":{"dur":3,"text":"although we didn't get terrible\nflak for age and time--"},"193":{"dur":3,"text":"actually women age much\nbetter than men, way better."},"196":{"dur":1,"text":"Men are terrible at it."},"198":{"dur":3,"text":"They just-- we hang onto the\npast in a way that actually"},"201":{"dur":1,"text":"eventually embarrassing."},"203":{"dur":2,"text":"And you don't realize it."},"205":{"dur":1,"text":"And you'll see that\nin the film, really."},"207":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's one of the things\nthat makes the film attractive"},"210":{"dur":2,"text":"because they do try\nand relive the past."},"212":{"dur":2,"text":"That's not just a\ncommercial reason to do it."},"214":{"dur":4,"text":"They literally do try and-- the\neffortless bravado of the past"},"219":{"dur":2,"text":"is kind of so\nattractive to them."},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's a couple of\nsequences where they do that."},"223":{"dur":2,"text":"But actually, it's\ninappropriate now in a way."},"226":{"dur":2,"text":"And anyway, women age\nmuch, much better."},"229":{"dur":2,"text":"And there are women\nin the film who"},"232":{"dur":1,"text":"don't have a huge amount to do."},"233":{"dur":3,"text":"But what they do, they do\ndevastatingly well, really."},"236":{"dur":1,"text":"Unlike our guys, yeah."},"238":{"dur":2,"text":"been sort of a catalyst for the\ncharacters in this-- for me,"},"241":{"dur":0,"text":"I'm like, OK."},"242":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, they're part\nof what has driven"},"244":{"dur":1,"text":"these guys to do these things."},"246":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was interesting\nbecause both Diane

more"},"259":{"dur":1,"text":"of the female perspective in?"},"260":{"dur":1,"text":"Or is it-- I mean,\nobviously the first one"},"262":{"dur":3,"text":"is so much about like\nthis guy dynamic."},"265":{"dur":1,"text":"DANNY BOYLE: Yes, it is."},"267":{"dur":4,"text":"And it was-- we did."},"271":{"dur":4,"text":"When we set up the film, the key\nquestions that people asked is,"},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"would the four guys\ncome back again"},"277":{"dur":1,"text":"to be at the center of the film?"},"279":{"dur":1,"text":"Would it be the same actors?"},"280":{"dur":1,"text":"But the second question\npeople always asked was,"},"282":{"dur":3,"text":"would Kelly MacDonald\ncome back to play Diane?"},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"And she does."},"289":{"dur":1,"text":"But we had another\nscene for her later."},"291":{"dur":1,"text":"So she did have a\nbigger part to play."},"293":{"dur":1,"text":"And we cut it because\nit diminished her."},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's weird the\nway film works."},"298":{"dur":2,"text":"It doesn't work like it\nis on the script at all."},"300":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's slightly-- it\nwas better that she just"},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"has this one central scene,\nwhich she does beautifully."},"305":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's devastatingly clear\nhow much more successfully"},"310":{"dur":4,"text":"she's dealt with time than\nRenton has dealt with time."},"314":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we actually, if\nanything in editing,"},"318":{"dur":1,"text":"we reduced it, really."},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"Their agency is very\nimportant in the film."},"322":{"dur":1,"text":"But it is quiet, yes."},"324":{"dur":2,"text":"DANA HAN-KLEIN: And that's\nnot to say there aren't"},"326":{"dur":1,"text":"strong female characters in it."},"327":{"dur":3,"text":"But it was interesting\nbecause they were returning."},"331":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, family and\nfather-son dynamics"},"333":{"dur":1,"text":"are also a big part of this."},"335":{"dur":1,"text":"Again, as a viewer,\nat least, I felt."},"336":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'm curious, like you\nknow, in the first one,"},"339":{"dur":3,"text":"it is all about youth and\nquestionable moral decisions."},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"But adding a family\nlayer definitely sort of"},"345":{"dur":0,"text":"changes that."},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"Were you at all afraid that\nit would adjust the tone?"},"349":{"dur":1,"text":"Or was it just like,\nno, this is actually"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"the best way to display\nsome of these evolutions"},"354":{"dur":1,"text":"DANNY BOYLE: Yeah, there's a\nwhole bunch of kids running"},"356":{"dur":1,"text":"around all the way through it."},"357":{"dur":3,"text":"Some of them are images\nof themselves as children."},"361":{"dur":3,"text":"Some of them are their children,\nwho are very disappointed"},"365":{"dur":1,"text":"in their fathers."},"366":{"dur":1,"text":"And some of them are\nimaginary children,"},"368":{"dur":1,"text":"in one of the characters' cases."},"372":{"dur":3,"text":"And obviously, from a\ncommercial point of view,"},"376":{"dur":1,"text":"that's very unattractive."},"377":{"dur":3,"text":"Because everybody\nwants to believe still"},"380":{"dur":1,"text":"that they're like they\nwere in the first film,"},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"where they were running\naround in this completely"},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"careless world."},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"But it's honest about\nreally where they are."},"388":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was quite interesting\nthat the four actors all"},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"became fathers after that\nfilm, the original film."},"394":{"dur":1,"text":"They weren't fathers\nwhen we made that film,"},"396":{"dur":1,"text":"and they've all\nbecome fathers now."},"397":{"dur":4,"text":"So it is very much a, like you\nsaid, it's a look at fatherhood"},"402":{"dur":3,"text":"in different relationships\nwith their own children,"},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"and also with their\nown fathers in a way."},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a couple of key scenes\nabout their own fathers,"},"410":{"dur":0,"text":"as well."},"411":{"dur":2,"text":"So that dynamic is very\nimportant to it, as well."},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"Which doesn't make it\nsound very attractive."},"415":{"dur":1,"text":"It makes it sound\nrather kind of--"},"416":{"dur":1,"text":"I can hear it as I'm saying it."},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"You think, oh my god, what have\nthey done to \"Trainspotting?\""},"420":{"dur":1,"text":"But actually, it's really--"},"421":{"dur":3,"text":"there's an honesty in it that's\nreally essential to it, really."},"425":{"dur":1,"text":"And you have to\nfind this balance"},"427":{"dur":1,"text":"when you do a sequel like this."},"428":{"dur":1,"text":"There's an extraordinary\nbalance you"},"430":{"dur":3,"text":"have to find between\neverybody wants it the same,"},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"but different."},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's that kind of thing\nwhere it's got to be-- it's"},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"got to have these trigger\npoints, these kind of muscle"},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"memories of the first film."},"441":{"dur":2,"text":"But also, to have any honesty,\nit's got to be different."},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"Because they're\n46 now, you know?"},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"And not 25."},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's the difference\nin that, really."},"451":{"dur":1,"text":"DANA HAN-KLEIN:\nOne of the things"},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"with that is like, there is\na good deal of humor in this,"},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not like a dark-- like,\nwe're making it sound very dark"},"457":{"dur":1,"text":"and dramatic, but\nthere were plenty--"},"459":{"dur":1,"text":"there was a ton of humor."},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"But how do you\nbalance those moments?"},"462":{"dur":1,"text":"And how do you make\nsure that humor"},"463":{"dur":1,"text":"is something that's universal?"},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"Because there was also a--"},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"a lot of it does have to do\nwith UK culture, and the source"},"470":{"dur":0,"text":"material."},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"But how do you manage that ship?"},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"DANNY BOYLE: You can't really\nthink like that really,"},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"because that's very much\na studio perspective."},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"How can we make sure this\nhumor applies everywhere?"},"480":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's deadly,\nI think, you know?"},"482":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, it's not in terms of\nPixar and things like that."},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"They do it brilliantly."},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"But in terms of the stuff\nI do, it would be deadly"},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"if you started to worry about,\nhow is that going to play?"},"492":{"dur":1,"text":"Especially with\ncharacters like this."},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"Because again, the\nfirst thing you do"},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"is start reducing\ntheir accents, so they"},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"were more comprehensible,\nwhich would"},"500":{"dur":3,"text":"be incredibly untruthful\nto them as characters."},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"Because their accents, it\nidentifies them in a way."},"507":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a kind of defiant\npride in how local"},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"their culture is, you know?"},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"Verbally anyway,\nand the linguistics"},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"that's in Irving Welsh's\nbooks are like that."},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"The book is a challenge\nto you from the get go."},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"As soon as you open it, it's\nlike, that's a challenge."},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"And can I do it?"},"523":{"dur":3,"text":"And obviously, as the\nway we know with accents,"},"526":{"dur":1,"text":"they unlock if you're patient."},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"They unlock very\nquickly for you."},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"But you can't compromise\nthat up front,"},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"which it would be\nthe tendency to do"},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"to make it more\npalatable, or to make sure"},"535":{"dur":1,"text":"that it traveled really."},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"You just hope that\nit will, that people"},"539":{"dur":3,"text":"will see things in it that\nthey recognize across cultures,"},"542":{"dur":0,"text":"I guess."},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"DANA HAN-KLEIN: I guess\naging is a universal thing"},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"across cultures, whether\nor not we want it to be."},"549":{"dur":1,"text":"It's in the cards\nfor all of us, so it"},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"will be there, even though you\ndon't like acknowledging it"},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"But yeah, it's\nthere for everyone,"},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"whether you're president\nor whether you're homeless."},"559":{"dur":1,"text":"The same applies."},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"DANA HAN-KLEIN: If you\ncould go back 21 years"},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"and tell yourself one thing\nabout where either your journey"},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"or where this film's journey\nwas going to take you,"},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"would you take the opportunity?"},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"And if so, what would\nyou tell yourself?"},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"DANNY BOYLE: Oh my god,\nthose letters that people"},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"write to themselves\nas younger people."},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"Oh my god, I don't know\nwhat I'd say, really."},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"I've been very lucky really\nwith the stuff I've done."},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, I think I'd probably\nput more time in with my kids,"},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"really."},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"I haven't because I've been\nout doing stuff like this"},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"and making films,\nand stuff like that."},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"So I suppose I'd say, look out\nfor that a bit more, really."},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"Because kind of you can't\nrepeat it back again."},"595":{"dur":4,"text":"But that's a terribly\ndepressing thought, really."},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah, enjoy culture, really."},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"That's the most important thing."},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"We were just talking\nabout this before about--"},"607":{"dur":5,"text":"someone said, so Renton in the\nfilm has a terrible crisis."},"612":{"dur":3,"text":"His relationship in\nAmsterdam was broken down."},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's one of the\nthings that drives him back."},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"And he has

of--"},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"well, I won't tell you\nbecause that will spoil it,"},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"but he is in crisis about."},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"And this guy said to me,\nwhat would you say to a guy"},"632":{"dur":1,"text":"like that who's 46?"},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"He has a line in the film\nwhere he says, \"I'm 46,"},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"and I'm fucked.\""},"637":{"dur":1,"text":"What would you say\nto a guy like that?"},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"And I was trying to\nthink, what would you"},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"say to someone like that?"},"642":{"dur":4,"text":"And all you would say is,\nreach for culture, really."},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"Because it can save\nyou in a way that--"},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"I've learned, over time."},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"And the future that\nwe all face now,"},"654":{"dur":5,"text":"with jobs becoming more\nremote, or becoming--"},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"not being there anymore\nbecause of robotization,"},"663":{"dur":4,"text":"or mechanization, you\njust reach for culture."},"667":{"dur":1,"text":"It'll save you in the end."},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"That's my own personal\nphilosophy, you know?"},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"It's like that thing--\nwhy do you read?"},"674":{"dur":1,"text":"That's what they say, isn't it?"},"675":{"dur":3,"text":"When you read a

know you're not alone."},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"Because you recognize things."},"685":{"dur":2,"text":"And the reach of culture is--"},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"and I know it's a terrible\ntime at the moment,"},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"and it certainly is in\nBritain, the way culture"},"692":{"dur":3,"text":"is just sneered at and\nkind of disparaged."},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's not about\npolitics, culture."},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"It's actually about\nsomething much more important"},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"than everyday politics."},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"It's actually about\nsomething deep"},"704":{"dur":2,"text":"that connects people\nacross cultures,"},"707":{"dur":1,"text":"across their\nindividual cultures,"},"709":{"dur":1,"text":"and across time, I

remember we shot--"},"740":{"dur":1,"text":"we shot \"28 Days Later.\""},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a horror\nmovie that we made."},"747":{"dur":1,"text":"And when we shot it,\nthe idea of the film"},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"was that it was\nabout social rage."},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"Because there had been a\nnumber of incidences, which"},"753":{"dur":1,"text":"you hear about\noccasionally,

getting out and stabbing\neach other, you know?"},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"That kind of incredible,\nintolerant rage"},"767":{"dur":1,"text":"of each other that\nwas happening."},"768":{"dur":1,"text":"So that was our\nphilosophy for the film."},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"That was like, wow!"},"771":{"dur":1,"text":"We'll make a film\nabout social rage."},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"And the thing that\ndrives these zombies"},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"was actually a kind of\nintolerance of each other."},"777":{"dur":1,"text":"And that was our\nphilosophy and everything."},"779":{"dur":1,"text":"We set out to make the film."},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"We shot the opening in\nLondon in the summer."},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, he's wandering\naround London on his own,"},"784":{"dur":0,"text":"and it's empty."},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, we started\nshooting the main body"},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"of the film when 9\/11 happened."},"790":{"dur":1,"text":"And the film came out."},"791":{"dur":2,"text":"And the film was not\nabout social rage."},"794":{"dur":2,"text":"It was about the\nvulnerability of cities."},"796":{"dur":1,"text":"It was weird."},"798":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was-- and I think\nthe film was a hit here."},"801":{"dur":2,"text":"And I absolutely know\nthat was the reason."},"803":{"dur":3,"text":"Because it was the first film\nout of the block, the dead look"},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"at the terror of\nfeeling incredibly"},"808":{"dur":4,"text":"vulnerable in these amazing\ncities we build for ourselves."},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can't predict\nthat, you know?"},"815":{"dur":1,"text":"There's no way you'll know that."},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"So sometimes, they swim in\nand out of focus, really."},"818":{"dur":1,"text":"And you can't say\nwhat they'll be."},"820":{"dur":1,"text":"They take so long to make."},"822":{"dur":3,"text":"They're
