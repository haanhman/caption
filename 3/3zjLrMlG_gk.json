And they go to Mount Sinai. In the\nfirst snippet of this story, we're going to"},"710":{"dur":4,"text":"look at when they're in the wilderness of\nSinai, before they actually get to Mount Sinai."},"714":{"dur":5,"text":"Look at it. It's in your notes. This is from\nExodus 16. It says, \"The whole Israelite community"},"720":{"dur":4,"text":"set out for Elim and came to the Desert of\nSin, which is between Elim and Sinai.

And"},"801":{"dur":3,"text":"we tend to think of grumbling -- it's like,\n\"What's wrong with a little whining?\" Like,"},"804":{"dur":4,"text":"we tend to think about it as sort of a surface\ncomplaint.

You got to buck up. But"},"813":{"dur":6,"text":"me, this is totally justified. And the issue\nwith grumbling is this, is it becomes this"},"820":{"dur":5,"text":"pattern for Israel that actually reveals something\nthat goes way deeper than a surface complaint"},"825":{"dur":4,"text":"because life is extraordinarily difficult\nin the wilderness. But it shows something"},"830":{"dur":5,"text":"about a posture of their soul. And here's\nwhat grumbling is at the deepest level. Write"},"836":{"dur":10,"text":"this down. Grumbling is forgetting who God\nis and what he's done. And gratitude is remembering"},"846":{"dur":10,"text":"who God is and what he's done. Let that sink\nin for a moment. Grumbling is when I let my"},"857":{"dur":8,"text":"default filter for life be one where I'm forgetting\nwho God is and I'm overlooking what he's done."},"866":{"dur":7,"text":"Gratitude is when my intentional focus is\nremembering who God is and what he's done."},"874":{"dur":7,"text":"And, listen, when you are in the wilderness\n-- like when I was in my wilderness -- it"},"881":{"dur":8,"text":"involves tremendous loss. And when human beings\nface loss, it is necessary and important to"},"889":{"dur":5,"text":"grieve the loss. There are stages to grieving.\nAnd if you don't grieve, then you're going"},"894":{"dur":4,"text":"to get stuck, and you're going to get frozen.\nSo I'm not saying you shouldn't grieve. You"},"898":{"dur":5,"text":"absolutely need to grieve. But there's a difference\nbetween grieving and grumbling. And grumbling"},"904":{"dur":6,"text":"is when I begin to let the suffering narrow\nmy field of vision. Okay? And there's, like,"},"910":{"dur":8,"text":"two lists. There's the lists of ways that\nevery day I am receiving gifts and goodness."},"919":{"dur":5,"text":"Like, for example, everyone just take a breath\nwith me. Come on. (Takes breath.) Just hold"},"925":{"dur":7,"text":"it, and then let it out. Cleansing breath;\nserenity now. Now, guess what? You're going"},"932":{"dur":8,"text":"to get 23,000 of those today. You didn't pay\nfor a single one. Every single one's a gift."},"941":{"dur":9,"text":"And, literally, there are thousands of ways\nevery day where there is goodness around us."},"950":{"dur":6,"text":"And it's really easy to miss it. You know,\nthe pleasant smell of a cup of coffee in the"},"957":{"dur":6,"text":"morning. The palette of colors at night when\nthe sunset's going down. Kansas skies -- they're"},"963":{"dur":8,"text":"the best. Maybe the laugh of your child. See,\nbut what happens in the wilderness, when we"},"972":{"dur":4,"text":"let the grumbling take over, rather than seeing\nthe list of thousands of things that are good,"},"977":{"dur":6,"text":"we begin to fixate on what? The list of things\nI do not have. And my field of vision begins"},"983":{"dur":6,"text":"to narrow down to that list of the things\nI do not have. And when we let that become"},"989":{"dur":4,"text":"our default setting, what it does is it begins\nto shrink us. It begins to make our heart"},"994":{"dur":12,"text":"colder and harder. And, literally, your quality\nof life in the wilderness comes down to this"},"1007":{"dur":8,"text":"choice. I remember reading a story probably\n15 years ago. It was an interview actually"},"1015":{"dur":4,"text":"with a guy named W. Mitchell.

And in this interview,\nhe said something that I'll never forget."},"1074":{"dur":5,"text":"He said, \"Before my injuries, there were 10,000\nthings I could do.

There's"},"1095":{"dur":10,"text":"a man who's chosen to remember gratitude in\nthe wilderness. So here's choice number one."},"1105":{"dur":7,"text":"Write it down.
