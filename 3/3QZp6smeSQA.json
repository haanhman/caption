{"15":{"dur":3,"text":"I'd like to start with a couple of quick examples."},"18":{"dur":2,"text":"These are spinneret glands"},"20":{"dur":2,"text":"on the abdomen of a spider."},"22":{"dur":3,"text":"They produce six different types of silk, which is spun together into a fiber,"},"25":{"dur":3,"text":"tougher than any fiber humans have ever made."},"28":{"dur":3,"text":"The nearest we've come is with aramid fiber."},"31":{"dur":2,"text":"And to make that, it involves extremes of temperature,"},"33":{"dur":3,"text":"extremes of pressure and loads of pollution."},"36":{"dur":3,"text":"And yet the spider manages to do it at ambient temperature and pressure"},"39":{"dur":3,"text":"with raw materials of dead flies and water."},"42":{"dur":2,"text":"It does suggest we've still got a bit to learn."},"44":{"dur":3,"text":"This beetle can detect a forest fire at 80 kilometers away."},"47":{"dur":2,"text":"That's roughly 10,000 times the range"},"49":{"dur":2,"text":"of man-made fire detectors."},"51":{"dur":2,"text":"And what's more, this guy doesn't need a wire"},"53":{"dur":4,"text":"connected all the way back to a power station burning fossil fuels."},"57":{"dur":3,"text":"So these two examples give a sense of what biomimicry can deliver."},"60":{"dur":3,"text":"If we could learn to make things and do things the way nature does,"},"63":{"dur":2,"text":"we could achieve factor 10, factor 100,"},"65":{"dur":2,"text":"maybe even factor 1,000 savings"},"67":{"dur":3,"text":"in resource and energy use."},"70":{"dur":3,"text":"And if we're to make progress with the sustainability revolution,"},"73":{"dur":2,"text":"I believe there are three really big changes"},"75":{"dur":2,"text":"we need to bring about."},"77":{"dur":3,"text":"Firstly, radical increases in resource efficiency."},"80":{"dur":2,"text":"Secondly, shifting from a linear, wasteful,"},"82":{"dur":2,"text":"polluting way of using resources"},"84":{"dur":2,"text":"to a closed-loop model."},"86":{"dur":2,"text":"And thirdly, changing from a fossil fuel economy"},"88":{"dur":2,"text":"to a solar economy."},"90":{"dur":2,"text":"And for all three of these, I believe,"},"92":{"dur":2,"text":"biomimicry has a lot of the solutions that we're going to need."},"94":{"dur":3,"text":"You could look at nature as being like a catalog of products,"},"97":{"dur":2,"text":"and all of those have benefited"},"99":{"dur":3,"text":"from a 3.8-billion-year research and development period."},"102":{"dur":3,"text":"And given that level of investment, it makes sense to use it."},"105":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'm going to talk about some projects that have explored these ideas."},"108":{"dur":2,"text":"And let's start with radical increases"},"110":{"dur":2,"text":"in resource efficiency."},"112":{"dur":2,"text":"When we were working on the Eden Project,"},"114":{"dur":2,"text":"we had to create a very large greenhouse"},"116":{"dur":2,"text":"in a site that was not only irregular,"},"118":{"dur":3,"text":"but it was continually changing because it was still being quarried."},"121":{"dur":2,"text":"It was a hell of a challenge,"},"123":{"dur":2,"text":"and it was actually examples from biology"},"125":{"dur":2,"text":"that provided a lot of the clues."},"127":{"dur":2,"text":"So for instance,"},"129":{"dur":2,"text":"it was soap bubbles that helped us generate a building form"},"131":{"dur":3,"text":"that would work regardless of the final ground levels."},"134":{"dur":2,"text":"Studying pollen grains"},"136":{"dur":2,"text":"and radiolaria and carbon molecules"},"138":{"dur":3,"text":"helped us devise the most efficient structural solution"},"141":{"dur":3,"text":"using hexagons and pentagons."},"144":{"dur":2,"text":"The next move was that we wanted"},"146":{"dur":2,"text":"to try and maximize the size of those hexagons."},"148":{"dur":2,"text":"And to do that we had to find an alternative to glass,"},"150":{"dur":3,"text":"which is really very limited in terms of its unit sizes."},"153":{"dur":3,"text":"And in nature there are lots of examples"},"156":{"dur":3,"text":"of very efficient structures based on pressurized membranes."},"159":{"dur":3,"text":"So we started exploring this material called ETFE."},"162":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a high-strength polymer."},"164":{"dur":2,"text":"And what you do is you put it together in three layers,"},"166":{"dur":3,"text":"you weld it around the edge, and then you inflate it."},"169":{"dur":2,"text":"And the great thing about this stuff"},"171":{"dur":2,"text":"is you can make it in units"},"173":{"dur":2,"text":"of roughly seven times the size of glass,"},"175":{"dur":2,"text":"and it was only one percent of the weight of double-glazing."},"177":{"dur":2,"text":"So that was a factor-100 saving."},"179":{"dur":3,"text":"And what we found is that we got into a positive cycle"},"182":{"dur":2,"text":"in which one breakthrough facilitated another."},"184":{"dur":3,"text":"So with such large, lightweight pillows,"},"187":{"dur":2,"text":"we had much less steel."},"189":{"dur":2,"text":"With less steel we were getting more sunlight in,"},"191":{"dur":3,"text":"which meant we didn't have to put as much extra heat in winter."},"194":{"dur":2,"text":"And with less overall weight in the superstructure,"},"196":{"dur":2,"text":"there were big savings in the foundations."},"198":{"dur":2,"text":"And at the end of the project we worked out"},"200":{"dur":2,"text":"that the weight of that superstructure"},"202":{"dur":3,"text":"was actually less than the weight of the air inside the building."},"205":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think the Eden Project is a fairly good example"},"208":{"dur":2,"text":"of how ideas from biology"},"210":{"dur":3,"text":"can lead to radical increases in resource efficiency --"},"213":{"dur":2,"text":"delivering the same function,"},"215":{"dur":2,"text":"but with a fraction of the resource input."},"217":{"dur":2,"text":"And actually there are loads of examples in nature"},"219":{"dur":3,"text":"that you could turn to for similar solutions."},"222":{"dur":3,"text":"So for instance, you could develop super-efficient roof structures"},"225":{"dur":3,"text":"based on giant Amazon water lilies,"},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"whole buildings inspired by abalone shells,"},"230":{"dur":3,"text":"super-lightweight bridges inspired by plant cells."},"233":{"dur":3,"text":"There's a world of beauty and efficiency to explore here"},"236":{"dur":3,"text":"using nature as a design tool."},"239":{"dur":3,"text":"So now I want to go onto talking about the linear-to-closed-loop idea."},"242":{"dur":2,"text":"The way we tend to use resources"},"244":{"dur":2,"text":"is we extract them,"},"246":{"dur":2,"text":"we turn them into short-life products and then dispose of them."},"248":{"dur":2,"text":"Nature works very differently."},"250":{"dur":2,"text":"In ecosystems, the waste from one organism"},"252":{"dur":2,"text":"becomes the nutrient for something else in that system."},"254":{"dur":2,"text":"And there are some examples of projects"},"256":{"dur":3,"text":"that have deliberately tried to mimic ecosystems."},"259":{"dur":2,"text":"And one of my favorites"},"261":{"dur":2,"text":"is called the Cardboard to Caviar Project"},"263":{"dur":2,"text":"by Graham Wiles."},"265":{"dur":3,"text":"And in their area they had a lot of shops and restaurants"},"268":{"dur":3,"text":"that were producing lots of food, cardboard and plastic waste."},"271":{"dur":2,"text":"It was ending up in landfills."},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"Now the really clever bit is what they did with the cardboard waste."},"275":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'm just going to talk through this animation."},"278":{"dur":2,"text":"So they were paid to collect it from the restaurants."},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"They then shredded the cardboard"},"282":{"dur":3,"text":"and sold it to equestrian centers as horse bedding."},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"When that was soiled, they were paid again to collect it."},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"They put it into worm recomposting systems,"},"289":{"dur":3,"text":"which produced a lot of worms, which they fed to Siberian sturgeon,"},"292":{"dur":3,"text":"which produced caviar, which they sold back to the restaurants."},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"So it transformed a linear process"},"297":{"dur":2,"text":"into a closed-loop model,"},"299":{"dur":3,"text":"and it created more value in the process."},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"Graham Wiles has continued to add more and more elements to this,"},"304":{"dur":3,"text":"turning waste streams into schemes that create value."},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"And just as natural systems"},"309":{"dur":3,"text":"tend to increase in diversity and resilience over time,"},"312":{"dur":2,"text":"there's a real sense with this project"},"314":{"dur":3,"text":"that the number of possibilities"},"317":{"dur":2,"text":"just continue increasing."},"319":{"dur":2,"text":"And I know it's a quirky example,"},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"but I think the implications of this are quite radical,"},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"because it suggests that we could actually"},"325":{"dur":3,"text":"transform a big problem -- waste -- into a massive opportunity."},"328":{"dur":2,"text":"And particularly in cities --"},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"we could look at the whole metabolism of cities,"},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"and look at those as opportunities."},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's what we're doing on the next project I'm going to talk about,"},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"the Mobius Project,"},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"where we're trying to bring together a number of activities,"},"340":{"dur":2,"text":"all within one building,"},"342":{"dur":3,"text":"so that the waste from one can be the nutrient for another."},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"And the kind of elements I'm talking about"},"347":{"dur":3,"text":"are, firstly, we have a restaurant inside a productive greenhouse,"},"350":{"dur":2,"text":"a bit like this one in Amsterdam called De Kas."},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"Then we would have an anaerobic digester,"},"354":{"dur":3,"text":"which could deal with all the biodegradable waste from the local area,"},"357":{"dur":2,"text":"turn that into heat for the greenhouse"},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"and electricity to feed back into the grid."},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"We'd have a water treatment system"},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"treating wastewater, turning that into fresh water"},"365":{"dur":2,"text":"and generating energy from the solids"},"367":{"dur":3,"text":"using just plants and micro-organisms."},"370":{"dur":2,"text":"We'd have a fish farm fed with vegetable waste from the kitchen"},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"and worms from the compost"},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"and supplying fish back to the restaurant."},"376":{"dur":3,"text":"And we'd also have a coffee shop, and the waste grains from that"},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"could be used as a substrate for growing mushrooms."},"381":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can see that we're bringing together"},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"cycles of food, energy and water and waste"},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"all within one building."},"387":{"dur":3,"text":"And just for fun, we've proposed this for a roundabout in central London,"},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"which at the moment is a complete eyesore."},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"Some of you may recognize this."},"394":{"dur":2,"text":"And with just a little bit of planning,"},"396":{"dur":3,"text":"we could transform a space dominated by traffic"},"399":{"dur":3,"text":"into one that provides open space for people,"},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"reconnects people with food"},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"and transforms waste into closed loop opportunities."},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"So the final project I want to talk about"},"409":{"dur":3,"text":"is the Sahara Forest Project, which we're working on at the moment."},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"It may come as a surprise to some of you"},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"to hear that quite large areas of what are currently desert"},"416":{"dur":3,"text":"were actually forested a fairly short time ago."},"419":{"dur":3,"text":"So for instance, when Julius Caesar arrived in North Africa,"},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"huge areas of North Africa"},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"were covered in cedar and cypress forests."},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"And during the evolution of life on the Earth,"},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"it was the colonization"},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"of the land by plants"},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"that helped create the benign climate we currently enjoy."},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"The converse is also true."},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"The more vegetation we lose,"},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"the more that's likely to exacerbate climate change"},"441":{"dur":3,"text":"and lead to further desertification."},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"And this animation,"},"446":{"dur":3,"text":"this shows photosynthetic activity over the course of a number of years,"},"449":{"dur":3,"text":"and what you can see is that the boundaries of those deserts"},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"shift quite a lot,"},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"and that raises the question"},"456":{"dur":3,"text":"of whether we can intervene at the boundary conditions"},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"to halt, or maybe even reverse, desertification."},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you look at some of the organisms"},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"that have evolved to live in deserts,"},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"there are some amazing examples of adaptations to water scarcity."},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the Namibian fog-basking beetle,"},"471":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's evolved a way of harvesting its own fresh water in a desert."},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"The way it does this is it comes out at night,"},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"crawls to the top of a sand dune,"},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"and because it's got a matte black shell,"},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"is able to radiate heat out to the night sky"},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"and become slightly cooler than its surroundings."},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"So when the moist breeze blows in off the sea,"},"486":{"dur":3,"text":"you get these droplets of water forming on the beetle's shell."},"489":{"dur":3,"text":"Just before sunrise, he tips his shell up, the water runs down into his mouth,"},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"has a good drink, goes off and hides for the rest of the day."},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"And the ingenuity, if you could call it that,"},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"goes even further."},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"Because if you look closely at the beetle's shell,"},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"there are lots of little bumps on that shell."},"502":{"dur":3,"text":"And those bumps are hydrophilic; they attract water."},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"Between them there's a waxy finish which repels water."},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"And the effect of this is that"},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"as the droplets start to form on the bumps,"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"they stay in tight, spherical beads,"},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"which means they're much more mobile"},"516":{"dur":3,"text":"than they would be if it was just a film of water over the whole beetle's shell."},"519":{"dur":3,"text":"So even when there's only a small amount of moisture in the air,"},"522":{"dur":3,"text":"it's able to harvest that very effectively and channel it down to its mouth."},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"So amazing example of an adaptation"},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"to a very resource-constrained environment --"},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"and in that sense, very relevant"},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"to the kind of challenges we're going to be facing"},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"over the next few years, next few decades."},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"We're working with the guy who invented the Seawater Greenhouse."},"537":{"dur":3,"text":"This is a greenhouse designed for arid coastal regions,"},"540":{"dur":4,"text":"and the way it works is that you have this whole wall of evaporator grills,"},"544":{"dur":2,"text":"and you trickle seawater over that"},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"so that wind blows through, it picks up a lot of moisture"},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"and is cooled in the process."},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"So inside it's cool and humid,"},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"which means the plants need less water to grow."},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"And then at the back of the greenhouse,"},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"it condenses a lot of that humidity as freshwater"},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"in a process that is effectively identical to the beetle."},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"And what they found with the first Seawater Greenhouse that was built"},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"was it was producing slightly more freshwater"},"567":{"dur":3,"text":"than it needed for the plants inside."},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"So they just started spreading this on the land around,"},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"and the combination of that and the elevated humidity"},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"had quite a dramatic effect on the local area."},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"This photograph was taken on completion day,"},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"and just one year later, it looked like that."},"582":{"dur":3,"text":"So it was like a green inkblot spreading out from the building"},"585":{"dur":3,"text":"turning barren land back into biologically productive land --"},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"and in that sense, going beyond sustainable design"},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"to achieve restorative design."},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"So we were keen to scale this up"},"594":{"dur":3,"text":"and apply biomimicry ideas to maximize the benefits."},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"And when you think about nature,"},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"often you think about it as being all about competition."},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"But actually in mature ecosystems,"},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"you're just as likely to find examples"},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"of symbiotic relationships."},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"So an important biomimicry principle"},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"is to find ways of bringing technologies together"},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"in symbiotic clusters."},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"And the technology that we settled on"},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"as an ideal partner for the Seawater Greenhouse"},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"is concentrated solar power,"},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"which uses solar-tracking mirrors to focus the sun's heat"},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"to create electricity."},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"And just to give you some sense of the potential of CSP,"},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"consider that we receive"},"628":{"dur":3,"text":"10,000 times as much energy from the sun every year"},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"as we use in energy from all forms --"},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"10,000 times."},"635":{"dur":2,"text":"So our energy problems are not intractable."},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a challenge to our ingenuity."},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"And the kind of synergies I'm talking about"},"641":{"dur":4,"text":"are, firstly, both these technologies work very well in hot, sunny deserts."},"645":{"dur":3,"text":"CSP needs a supply of demineralized freshwater."},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"That's exactly what the Seawater Greenhouse produces."},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"CSP produces a lot of waste heat."},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"We'll be able to make use of all that to evaporate more seawater"},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"and enhance the restorative benefits."},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"And finally, in the shade under the mirrors,"},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"it's possible to grow all sorts of crops"},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"that would not grow in direct sunlight."},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is how this scheme would look."},"665":{"dur":3,"text":"The idea is we create this long hedge of greenhouses facing the wind."},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"We'd have concentrated solar power plants"},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"at intervals along the way."},"672":{"dur":3,"text":"Some of you might be wondering what we would do with all the salts."},"675":{"dur":3,"text":"And with biomimicry, if you've got an underutilized resource,"},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"you don't think, \"How am I going to dispose of this?\""},"680":{"dur":3,"text":"You think, \"What can I add to the system to create more value?\""},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"And it turns out"},"685":{"dur":2,"text":"that different things crystallize out at different stages."},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"When you evaporate seawater, the first thing to crystallize out"},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"is calcium carbonate."},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"And that builds up on the evaporators --"},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's what that image on the left is --"},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"gradually getting encrusted with the calcium carbonate."},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"So after a while, we could take that out,"},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"use it as a lightweight building block."},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you think about the carbon in that,"},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"that would have come out of the atmosphere, into the sea"},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"and then locked away in a building product."},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"The next thing is sodium chloride."},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"You can also compress that into a building block,"},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"as they did here."},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"This is a hotel in Bolivia."},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"And then after that, there are all sorts"},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"of compounds and elements that we can extract,"},"719":{"dur":3,"text":"like phosphates, that we need to get back into the desert soils to fertilize them."},"722":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's just about every element of the periodic table"},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"in seawater."},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"So it should be possible to extract valuable elements"},"728":{"dur":3,"text":"like lithium for high-performance batteries."},"732":{"dur":3,"text":"And in parts of the Arabian Gulf,"},"735":{"dur":3,"text":"the seawater, the salinity is increasing steadily"},"738":{"dur":2,"text":"due to the discharge of waste brine"},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"from desalination plants."},"742":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's pushing the ecosystem close to collapse."},"745":{"dur":2,"text":"Now we would be able to make use of all that waste brine."},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"We could evaporate it"},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"to enhance the restorative benefits"},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"and capture the salts,"},"753":{"dur":3,"text":"transforming an urgent waste problem into a big opportunity."},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"Really the Sahara Forest Project is a model"},"758":{"dur":3,"text":"for how we could create zero-carbon food,"},"761":{"dur":3,"text":"abundant renewable energy in some of the most water-stressed parts of the planet"},"764":{"dur":4,"text":"as well as reversing desertification in certain areas."},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"So returning to those big challenges that I mentioned at the beginning:"},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"radical increases in resource efficiency,"},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"closing loops and a solar economy."},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"They're not just possible; they're critical."},"778":{"dur":3,"text":"And I firmly believe that studying the way nature solves problems"},"781":{"dur":3,"text":"will provide a lot of the solutions."},"784":{"dur":3,"text":"But perhaps more than anything, what this thinking provides"},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"is a really positive way of talking about sustainable design."},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"Far too much of the talk about the environment"},"791":{"dur":2,"text":"uses very negative language."},"793":{"dur":3,"text":"But here it's about synergies and abundance and optimizing."},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is an important point."},"798":{"dur":2,"text":"Antoine de Saint-Exupery once said,"},"800":{"dur":2,"text":"\"If you want to build a flotilla of ships,"},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"you don't sit around talking about carpentry."},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"No, you need to set people's souls ablaze"},"807":{"dur":2,"text":"with visions of exploring distant shores.\""},"809":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's what we need to do, so let's be positive,"},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"and let's make progress with what could
