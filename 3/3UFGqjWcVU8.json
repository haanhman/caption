hour."},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"They can't escape it."},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"So what can we do now?"},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"We can't decrease wind speeds"},"619":{"dur":3,"text":"or keep sub-Arctic animals\nfrom migrating north,"},"622":{"dur":5,"text":"but we can work on local solutions\nto reducing human-caused underwater noise."},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"One of these solutions\nis to slow down ships"},"632":{"dur":1,"text":"that traverse the Arctic,"},"634":{"dur":3,"text":"because a slower ship is a quieter ship."},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"We can restrict access\nin seasons and regions"},"641":{"dur":4,"text":"that are important for mating,\nor feeding, or migrating."},"646":{"dur":3,"text":"We can get smarter about quieting ships"},"650":{"dur":3,"text":"and find better ways\nto explore the ocean bottom."},"654":{"dur":4,"text":"The good news is there are people\nworking on this right now."},"658":{"dur":4,"text":"But ultimately, we humans\nhave to do the hard work"},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"of reversing, or at the very least,"},"665":{"dur":4,"text":"decelerating human-caused\natmospheric changes."},"669":{"dur":4,"text":"So let's return to this idea\nof a silent world underwater."},"675":{"dur":1,"text":"It's entirely possible"},"677":{"dur":3,"text":"that many of the whales\nswimming in the Arctic today,"},"680":{"dur":3,"text":"especially long-lived species\nlike the bowhead whale"},"683":{"dur":3,"text":"- that the Inuit say\ncan live two human lives -"},"687":{"dur":3,"text":"it's possible that these whales\nwere alive in 1956"},"691":{"dur":2,"text":"when Jacques Cousteau made his film."},"694":{"dur":6,"text":"In retrospect, considering all the noise\nwe are creating in the oceans today,"},"701":{"dur":3,"text":"perhaps it really was \"The silent world.\""},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you."},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"(Applause)"}}
