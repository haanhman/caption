offers."},"432":{"dur":2,"text":"And finally, we give them\nmassive air cover,"},"434":{"dur":1,"text":"from the leadership inside the agencies"},"436":{"dur":2,"text":"all the way up to the President

business\nfrom the inside out."},"448":{"dur":3,"text":"If you study classic\npatterns of disruption,"},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"one very common pattern is rather simple."},"454":{"dur":3,"text":"It's to take something that has become\nroutine and standard in one industry"},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"and apply it to another\nwhere it's a radical departure"},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"from the status quo."},"461":{"dur":3,"text":"Think about what Airbnb took\nthat was normal from hospitality"},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"and revolutionized my apartment."},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"The United States

government,"},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"where it is a radical departure\nfrom the status quo."},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, the good news is:"},"487":{"dur":1,"text":"it's starting to work."},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"We know this because we can\nalready see the results"},"492":{"dur":3,"text":"from some of our early projects,\nlike the rescue effort of Healthcare.gov,"},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"when that went off the rails."},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"Fixing Healthcare.gov was the first place\nthat we ran this play,"},"501":{"dur":1,"text":"and today we

if I can take a moment"},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"and brag about the team for a second --"},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"it is the highest\nconcentration of badasses"},"516":{"dur":2,"text":"I could have ever

join their government."},"527":{"dur":1,"text":"And what's incredible is,"},"528":{"dur":3,"text":"everybody is as eager and kind\nas they are intelligent."},"532":{"dur":3,"text":"And I might add, by the way,\nover half of us are women."},"536":{"dur":4,"text":"(Applause)"},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"The best way to understand this strategy"},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"is actually to walk through\na couple of examples"},"547":{"dur":1,"text":"of how it's working out in the wild."},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going to give you\ntwo examples quickly."},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"The first one is about immigration."},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"This, my friends, is your typical\nimmigration application."},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes, you guessed it --"},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"it's almost entirely paper-based."},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"In the best case,"},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"the application takes about six\nto eight months to process."},"565":{"dur":3,"text":"It is physically shipped thousands\nof miles -- thousands of miles! --"},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"between no less than six\nprocessing centers."},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, little story:"},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"about a decade ago,"},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"the government thought\nthat if it brought this system online,"},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"it could save taxpayer dollars\nand provide a better service,"},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"which was a great idea."},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"So, the typical government process began."},"585":{"dur":4,"text":"Six years and 1.2 billion dollars later,"},"590":{"dur":2,"text":"no working product was delivered --"},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"1.2 billion with a \"B.\""},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"Now at this point, the agency responsible,"},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"US Citizenship and Immigration Services,"},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"could have kept pouring money\ninto the failing program."},"602":{"dur":1,"text":"Sadly, that's what often happens."},"604":{"dur":1,"text":"That's the status quo today."},"606":{"dur":1,"text":"But they didn't."},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"The dedicated civil servants\ninside the agency"},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"decided to stand up and call for change."},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"We deployed a small team\nof just six people,"},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"and what many people don't know is"},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"that's the same size as the rescue\neffort of Healthcare.gov --"},"619":{"dur":1,"text":"just six people."},"620":{"dur":1,"text":"And that team jumped in, side-by-side,"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"to support the agency\nin transitioning this project"},"624":{"dur":3,"text":"into more modern business practices,\nmore modern development practices."},"629":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, in non-tech speak,"},"630":{"dur":3,"text":"what that basically means\nis taking big, multi-year projects"},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"and breaking them up\ninto bite-sized chunks,"},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"so that way we can reduce the risk"},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"and actually start to see results\nevery couple of weeks,"},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"instead of waiting\nin a black box for years."},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"So within less than three months\nof our team being on the ground,"},"646":{"dur":3,"text":"we were already able to push\nour first products to production."},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"The first one, this is the form I-90."},"652":{"dur":3,"text":"This is used to file\nfor your replacement green card."},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, for immigrant visa holders,"},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"a replacement green card is a big deal."},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"Your green card is your proof\nof identification,"},"662":{"dur":1,"text":"it's your work authorization,"},"664":{"dur":2,"text":"it's the proof that you can\nbe here in this country."},"666":{"dur":3,"text":"So waiting six months while the government\nprocesses the replacement"},"670":{"dur":1,"text":"is not cool."},"671":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm excited to tell you that today,"},"673":{"dur":3,"text":"you can now, for the first time,\nfile for a replacement green card"},"676":{"dur":3,"text":"entirely online without anyone\ntouching a piece of paper."},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"It is faster, it is cheaper,"},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's a better user experience\nfor the applicant"},"683":{"dur":1,"text":"and the government employees alike."},"685":{"dur":3,"text":"(Applause)"},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"Another one, quickly."},"693":{"dur":3,"text":"Last fall, we just released\na brand-new practice civics test."},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"So as part of becoming a US citizen,"},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"you have to pass a civics test."},"701":{"dur":4,"text":"For anyone who has taken this test,\nit can be quite the stressful process."},"706":{"dur":4,"text":"So our team released a very easy,\nsimple-to-use tool in

confident"},"716":{"dur":3,"text":"in taking the next step\nin pursuing their American dream."},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"Because all of this work,\nall of this work on immigration,"},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"is about taking complicated processes\nand making them more human."},"727":{"dur":3,"text":"The other day, one of the dedicated\ncivil servants on the ground"},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"said something incredibly profound."},"733":{"dur":3,"text":"She said that she's never been\nthis hopeful or optimistic"},"736":{"dur":2,"text":"about a project in her entire\ntime in government."},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"And she's been doing this for 30 years."},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"That is exactly the kind of hope\nand culture change"},"745":{"dur":1,"text":"we are trying to create."},"747":{"dur":3,"text":"For my second example, I want to bring\nit back to veterans for a second,"},"750":{"dur":1,"text":"and what we are doing to build them a VA"},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"that is worthy of their service\nand their sacrifice."},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm proud to say\nthat just a few months ago,"},"758":{"dur":1,"text":"we released a brand-new beta"},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"of a new website, Vets.gov."},"762":{"dur":1,"text":"Vets.gov is a simple, easy-to-use website"},"764":{"dur":3,"text":"that brings all of the online services\na veteran needs into one place."},"768":{"dur":2,"text":"One website, not thousands."},"772":{"dur":2,"text":"The site is a work in progress,\nbut it's significant progress,"},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"because it's designed\nwith the users who matter most:"},"777":{"dur":1,"text":"the veterans themselves."},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"This might sound incredibly obvious,\nbecause it should be,"},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"but sadly, this isn't\nnormal for government."},"784":{"dur":3,"text":"Far too often, product decisions\nare made by committees of stakeholders"},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"who do their best to represent\nthe interests of the user,"},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"but they're not necessarily\nthe users themselves."},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"So our team at the VA went out,\nwe looked at the data,"},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"we talked to veterans themselves"},"797":{"dur":1,"text":"and we started simple and small,"},"799":{"dur":3,"text":"with the two most important services\nthat matter most to them:"},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"education benefits\nand disability benefits."},"805":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm proud to say that they are\nlive on the site today,"},"808":{"dur":2,"text":"and as the team continues\nto streamline more services,"},"811":{"dur":2,"text":"they will be ported over here,\nand the old sites, shut
