thought,"},"28":{"dur":4,"text":"but on ideas that come down to us from the Western philosophical tradition."},"33":{"dur":4,"text":"We call it, a \"philosophical meditation\""},"37":{"dur":3,"text":"The basic premise is that a lot of the trouble in our minds,"},"41":{"dur":5,"text":"comes from thoughts that haven't been untangled, examined, and properly confronted."},"47":{"dur":5,"text":"And that because life moves so fast, we accumulate a lot of un-thought thoughts"},"52":{"dur":1,"text":"on a daily basis."},"54":{"dur":1,"text":"Insomnia, for

minds,"},"83":{"dur":4,"text":"and making sense of our disavowed feelings and ideas."},"87":{"dur":3,"text":"The first priority, is to set aside a bit of time."},"90":{"dur":3,"text":"Idealy some twenty minutes at least once every few days."},"94":{"dur":2,"text":"You should sit, probably in bed, early in the morning,"},"96":{"dur":2,"text":"or late in the evening, with a pad of

challenge in great, almost tedious detail."},"189":{"dur":3,"text":"Then, confront head on everything that could go wrong"},"192":{"dur":2,"text":"with the worrying situation or

second part of the philosophical meditation;"},"216":{"dur":2,"text":"the bit where you ask the second big question:"},"218":{"dur":2,"text":"\"Who am I upset with and why?\""},"222":{"dur":2,"text":"The theory here, is that we often don't allow ourselves"},"224":{"dur":3,"text":"to analyze the hurts that we receive from other people"},"228":{"dur":4,"text":"because

them?"},"285":{"dur":3,"text":"Next, it's time to take out of the cupboard of the mind all the thoughts"},"288":{"dur":3,"text":"that relate to ambition, and excitement."},"291":{"dur":2,"text":"This needs a range of positive emotions,"},"293":{"dur":4,"text":"tremors of interest, tentative enthusiasm to lights and so on"},"298":{"dur":3,"text":"that are hovering on the edges of

helps us, by creating an occasion"},"361":{"dur":4,"text":"where we can identify our thoughts, and get them in some kind of order."},"366":{"dur":3,"text":"Fears, resentments, and hopes become easier to name."},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"We get less scared of the contents of our own minds"},"372":{"dur":4,"text":"we grow calmer, less bitter and clearer about our diection in life."},"376":{"dur":4,"text":"We start, at last on the journey to knowing ourselves properly."}}
