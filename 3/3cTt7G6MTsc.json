they did it by\nhaving a lot of passion,"},"610":{"dur":4,"text":"but also by building a business\nthat had a phenomenal culture."},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"And so the three\nof us, at the time"},"616":{"dur":1,"text":"that they were selling\ntheir business,"},"618":{"dur":5,"text":"they went through a\nexperience of having a venture"},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"investor who didn't

say,"},"718":{"dur":3,"text":"maybe, is that we've come\nto a point in society"},"722":{"dur":3,"text":"where we're faced with some\nhuge social and environmental"},"725":{"dur":4,"text":"challenges, and a lot\nof those challenges"},"729":{"dur":3,"text":"can't be solved simply through\nkind of traditional means"},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"like nonprofits and government."},"735":{"dur":1,"text":"It's

attract talent."},"748":{"dur":4,"text":"And business makes\nup 75% or 80% of GDP."},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"So either business is going\nto be part of the problem,"},"755":{"dur":3,"text":"or it's going to be\npart of the solution."},"758":{"dur":5,"text":"And what we've seen is this\nincredible-- particularly"},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"amongst younger people--\nbut this incredible"},"766":{"dur":3,"text":"outpouring of entrepreneurship,\nof people wanting"},"769":{"dur":3,"text":"to use business\nto create change."},"773":{"dur":3,"text":"And so our feeling\nhas

about business"},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"as a tool for positive\nsocial change."},"785":{"dur":1,"text":"And that means that\nthere's not all the market"},"787":{"dur":1,"text":"infrastructure built
