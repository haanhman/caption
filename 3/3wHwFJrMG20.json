come\ntogether, the power of teamwork,"},"1144":{"dur":1,"text":"to be able\nto compete."},"1145":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, you can get the same\nprice point or even lower

to"},"1200":{"dur":2,"text":"compete by teaming up\nnationally so that you do get"},"1203":{"dur":1,"text":"competitive pricing."},"1204":{"dur":1,"text":"So, I like\nthat aspect of
