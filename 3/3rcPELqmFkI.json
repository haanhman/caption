discussed"},"186":{"dur":3,"text":"how they have recently changed\ntheir measurement instruments."},"190":{"dur":2,"text":"So evaluations of\nteaching are not static."},"193":{"dur":2,"text":"And

data"},"227":{"dur":3,"text":"for students making course\nselection decisions."},"230":{"dur":3,"text":"And this was a topic that\ncaused anxiety and controversy,"},"233":{"dur":2,"text":"and one where the\nperspectives of faculty,"},"236":{"dur":4,"text":"academic administrators, and\nstudents were pretty divergent."},"241":{"dur":3,"text":"We heard concerns about who\nhas access to what data at what"},"245":{"dur":2,"text":"time, and how\nmisunderstanding of data"},"247":{"dur":3,"text":"can really lead to\nsome bad decisions."},"250":{"dur":1,"text":"So we'll start by\nnoting that

that."},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"That's just baiting you."},"416":{"dur":1,"text":"So looking at the\nworksheet, you'll"},"418":{"dur":1,"text":"see there are four\nquestions there"},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"for individual reflection."},"422":{"dur":4,"text":"So we're going to ask you\nto take five minutes each."},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"Take five minutes to look\nat what's in the envelope."},"429":{"dur":2,"text":"And think about those\nfour questions, about--"},"432":{"dur":1,"text":"with this artifact,\nwith this instrument"},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"or with this

here?"},"451":{"dur":3,"text":"And what questions does\nthis model or approach"},"454":{"dur":1,"text":"raise for you?"},"456":{"dur":3,"text":"Then, in groups, you'll\ntalk about, in

every instrument"},"504":{"dur":1,"text":"for every person to look at."},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"Not a good use of paper."},"508":{"dur":3,"text":"So essentially your task now\nis five minutes of

make\nsense of them--"},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"there's a lot more you could\ndo with that individually."},"553":{"dur":4,"text":"But let's encourage you, now, to\nstart to talk as a group about,"},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"in general, what\ndid you notice here?"},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"What are the things\nthat you think"},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"are particularly strong or\nuseful about this approach?"},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"What are the things\nthat you think"},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"are drawbacks, or questions,\npuzzlements that you have?"},"569":{"dur":1,"text":"So kind of pro-con."},"571":{"dur":2,"text":"And again, if you'll\nappoint someone"},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"to take notes and be\nprepared to report out,"},"575":{"dur":3,"text":"you can see the strengths

models."},"616":{"dur":4,"text":"As I said, all of the models\nare available on the Bitly link"},"621":{"dur":3,"text":"that we've projected,\nand we'll project again."},"624":{"dur":3,"text":"For the time that we'll be\nanalyzing a specific model,"},"628":{"dur":4,"text":"Kris is going to show a portion\nof it on the document camera."},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"But there's a lot\nmore information"},"634":{"dur":1,"text":"that we won't be able\nto show at a glance."},"636":{"dur":3,"text":"So you'll be able to look\nat that later in the Bitly."},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"OK, lightning round."},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to be timing."},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"Anu is going to be facilitating."},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'm going to\ncome table to

timeline."},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"So in addition to\nmanaging my own time,"},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"I get to manage yours."},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"So we're going to start\nwith table one, which"},"660":{"dur":1,"text":"is in the far back."},"662":{"dur":3,"text":"As we take on each instrument,\nKris will pull the instrument"},"665":{"dur":1,"text":"up on the document

types of surveys."},"674":{"dur":1,"text":"Allison is going\nto use an iPhone"},"675":{"dur":1,"text":"timer set at two minutes."},"677":{"dur":3,"text":"So when it makes a loud sound,\nthen that is time to wrap up."},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"Our first model is\nStanford University,"},"683":{"dur":1,"text":"table one in the far back."},"685":{"dur":2,"text":"Tamara is our spokesperson."},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"OK, so the first\nthing to know on this"},"689":{"dur":3,"text":"is that the first question is\na customizable question based"},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"on learning goals."},"694":{"dur":3,"text":"And we both thought\nthat this is fantastic."},"697":{"dur":1,"text":"It emphasizes what\nthe instructor"},"699":{"dur":1,"text":"thinks is most important."},"700":{"dur":3,"text":"And it indicates a strong\ncommitment to student learning."},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"And that commitment\nto student learning"},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"is echoed in multiple questions."},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"However, we also felt that there\nare some potential drawbacks"},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"to both starting with\nthe learning goals"},"713":{"dur":3,"text":"and having this be\nopen-ended, in that,"},"716":{"dur":2,"text":"what if the learning goals\naren't well designed?"},"718":{"dur":1,"text":"What if an instructor\nputs in learning"},"720":{"dur":2,"text":"goals that are just easy to\nreach for the sake of getting"},"722":{"dur":0,"text":"good feedback?"},"723":{"dur":3,"text":"So we had a lot of questions\nabout how that actually works."},"727":{"dur":3,"text":"We think it's fantastic\nthat this survey has a lot"},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"of customizable questions,\nrealizing that there's not just"},"733":{"dur":3,"text":"one-size-fits-all for\nteaching and learning."},"736":{"dur":1,"text":"And it also seemed\nlike the interface"},"738":{"dur":4,"text":"would be easy to use on the\nside of the faculty member who"},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"needs to do that customizing."},"745":{"dur":1,"text":"There are a number of\nformative questions"},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"that will give the instructor\nsome feedback about how"},"750":{"dur":1,"text":"they can improve their course."},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"But on that note, we\nthought that there"},"755":{"dur":3,"text":"could be more specific\nopen-ended questions about ways"},"759":{"dur":1,"text":"to improve."},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"We noted that there\nwas no feedback"},"763":{"dur":3,"text":"about individual instructors."},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's see."},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"There were some kind of--"},"771":{"dur":4,"text":"there was clearly an emphasis\non online education here."},"775":{"dur":1,"text":"And that there is\na question about,"},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"what percentage of the class\nmeetings do you attend online?"},"779":{"dur":1,"text":"But we thought\nthat question could"},"781":{"dur":3,"text":"be challenging to interpret."},"784":{"dur":6,"text":"And we would appreciate a\nquestion about prior knowledge."},"791":{"dur":1,"text":"What did students\nbring into the class?"},"792":{"dur":4,"text":"And also how did this motivate\nthem to take further courses"},"797":{"dur":1,"text":"in this discipline?"},"805":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you, table one."},"806":{"dur":3,"text":"You've set a very good model\nfor the other tables to follow."},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"Table two had North\nCarolina State."},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"Please just share\nyour name, also, just"},"814":{"dur":1,"text":"before you give your wrap-up."},"816":{"dur":1,"text":"Hi, my name is David Jennings."},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"And yeah, like you said, we\nhad North Carolina State."},"821":{"dur":6,"text":"And this is a very comprehensive\nand prescriptive method"},"827":{"dur":3,"text":"of evaluation,\nthat we thought may"},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"be the case because it\nis a state school and not"},"832":{"dur":1,"text":"a private school."},"834":{"dur":3,"text":"But some strengths of it were\nthat it was comprehensive,"},"837":{"dur":1,"text":"like I said."},"838":{"dur":2,"text":"There's opportunities\nfor students to rate,"},"841":{"dur":4,"text":"peers to rate, instructors\nto discuss and self-rate"},"845":{"dur":1,"text":"themselves."},"846":{"dur":5,"text":"And also administrators to give\na final review of a portfolio."},"852":{"dur":5,"text":"So that 360 approach\nwe thought was good."},"857":{"dur":4,"text":"There's evaluation of the\nsyllabus by both students"},"862":{"dur":2,"text":"and peers."},"864":{"dur":2,"text":"And they seem to be very\ninterested in the goals"},"867":{"dur":2,"text":"and objectives of the syllabus."},"869":{"dur":2,"text":"There was some vague terms."},"871":{"dur":3,"text":"Like, they used the word\n\"appropriate\" a lot."},"875":{"dur":2,"text":"I think it's on the next page."},"877":{"dur":3,"text":"And so they never\nreally operationalized"},"880":{"dur":2,"text":"the term, appropriate."},"882":{"dur":5,"text":"So we saw some room for maybe\nsome political interference"},"888":{"dur":1,"text":"in some of this process."},"893":{"dur":2,"text":"We also thought that,\nwell it's a pro that it"},"896":{"dur":2,"text":"is prescriptive\nand measurable, it"},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"may be too rigid for\nacademic freedom."},"902":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we maybe\nhad some concerns"},"905":{"dur":3,"text":"about how this would work at\na liberal arts institution."},"911":{"dur":2,"text":"So some things that we\ncould adopt, possibly."},"913":{"dur":2,"text":"We liked the idea of\nsyllabus standards"},"916":{"dur":2,"text":"at the department level."},"918":{"dur":2,"text":"We also liked the\nidea of peer review"},"920":{"dur":4,"text":"among the department of goals\nand objectives in the syllabus,"},"925":{"dur":5,"text":"and potentially a peer review\ncommittee as well as some--"},"930":{"dur":3,"text":"even cross-departmental\ncollaboration."},"933":{"dur":2,"text":"Like people who are maybe\nin a different school"},"935":{"dur":3,"text":"but are teaching a\nsimilar discipline."},"942":{"dur":1,"text":"There's our timer."},"944":{"dur":1,"text":"But I think we've covered a lot."},"946":{"dur":3,"text":"And this particular\ndocument was also very long."},"949":{"dur":2,"text":"So your table gets\nextra credit for having"},"951":{"dur":2,"text":"to do a lot of reading."},"953":{"dur":3,"text":"Our third table is table\nthree, taking on the University"},"957":{"dur":1,"text":"of Pennsylvania."},"958":{"dur":2,"text":"And if the person\nspeaking could quickly"},"961":{"dur":1,"text":"give their name and start."},"962":{"dur":2,"text":"Hi, I'm Julia King."},"965":{"dur":1,"text":"This was an interesting one."},"966":{"dur":3,"text":"Because if you\nflip the page over,"},"969":{"dur":4,"text":"the way the students saw\nthe rankings of a course"},"974":{"dur":2,"text":"was almost like\nRateMyProfessors.com"},"976":{"dur":2,"text":"when they're picking\ntheir courses."},"978":{"dur":2,"text":"And these numbers--\nwe're not sure"},"981":{"dur":2,"text":"exactly how, but they\ncame from the survey that"},"984":{"dur":1,"text":"was on the other side."},"986":{"dur":1,"text":"We thought the\nstrengths were that it"},"987":{"dur":2,"text":"would take very little time\nto fill out the survey."},"992":{"dur":2,"text":"There's no survey\nfatigue, because it"},"994":{"dur":1,"text":"was very simple to answer."},"999":{"dur":2,"text":"This could be a\nstrength or a weakness."},"1001":{"dur":2,"text":"The first question was asking\nthe quality of the course."},"1004":{"dur":3,"text":"So it kind of gave\nsomeone an opportunity"},"1007":{"dur":4,"text":"to just instinctively\nchoose what they thought"},"1011":{"dur":1,"text":"the quality was right\noff the bat without being"},"1013":{"dur":1,"text":"asked some further questions."},"1015":{"dur":2,"text":"A few interesting\nthings about this one"},"1017":{"dur":3,"text":"is that, in the\ndescription it says"},"1020":{"dur":5,"text":"that questions 6 through\n10 were recently added."},"1025":{"dur":2,"text":"And the survey used to be just\none, two, three, four, five,"},"1028":{"dur":1,"text":"and then 10, 11."},"1030":{"dur":2,"text":"And the original survey\nwas very much based"},"1032":{"dur":3,"text":"on quality, difficulty, and\nif you like the professor."},"1035":{"dur":2,"text":"And then
