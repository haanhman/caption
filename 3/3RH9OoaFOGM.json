And\nnobody really understood that."},"472":{"dur":6,"text":"And in around about 1999, I started to wane.\nI wanted to go to the big city, New York City."},"478":{"dur":5,"text":"And I had a great opportunity. A friend of\nmine, Mikon van Gastel, who was one of the"},"483":{"dur":6,"text":"creative directors at Imaginary Forces, called\nme up at two o'clock in the morning one night"},"490":{"dur":7,"text":"and said, \"Would you like to join us?\" And\nI was like, \"Sure, but what for?\" He was like,"},"497":{"dur":5,"text":"\"Well, we're doing this project.

We're going to\nmove to New York, and we're going to do this"},"529":{"dur":3,"text":"project, and you can do other projects as\nwell.\" And I was like, \"Yeah, let me think"},"533":{"dur":5,"text":"about it.\" And over the course of that particular\nyear, I decided to move."},"539":{"dur":9,"text":"And the project that we built was for Morgan\nStanley. And if anybody's been to Times Square,"},"548":{"dur":4,"text":"it's really not the Morgan Stanley building\nanymore. It was the Lehman Brothers building."},"553":{"dur":4,"text":"[laughs] Now it's the Barclays Bank building."},"558":{"dur":5,"text":"So, not many people know this, that it's the\nlargest screen in the country. It's a block"},"564":{"dur":9,"text":"and a half long, and five to six stories high.\nAnd the mission of Imaginary Forces was to"},"573":{"dur":7,"text":"design and build a very intelligent interactive\nsystem?well, actually, a motion-graphic interactive"},"581":{"dur":8,"text":"system?that would work to brand Morgan Stanley\nwithin this part of Times Square, which is"},"589":{"dur":6,"text":"not the main part. It's just a little bit\nup the road, but it's within the zonal area"},"596":{"dur":8,"text":"where New York basically states, \"If you want\nto build a new building, you must put up a"},"604":{"dur":1,"text":"screen.\""},"605":{"dur":1,"text":"[laughter]"},"606":{"dur":5,"text":"Eddie: It's by law. It's a law. [laughs] It's\nquite incredible. You have to put a screen"},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"up."},"612":{"dur":7,"text":"So, that was the mission. And so we developed\ndifferent pieces that would actually work"},"620":{"dur":6,"text":"for this particular screen. Well, I think\nMikon was working over two years. I was working"},"626":{"dur":8,"text":"over a year and a little bit. It kind of grew\non us. It's actually still one of my favorite"},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"pieces that I've ever done."},"636":{"dur":5,"text":"And what makes it really interesting is that\nit's not just only motion graphics. It's the"},"642":{"dur":9,"text":"whole idea that it had a sense of intelligence.\nIt understood when to change itself. It understood"},"651":{"dur":7,"text":"to push more content to the screen at different,\nparticular times. And that's the essence of"},"659":{"dur":6,"text":"Times Square. It's not just about ads anymore.\nIt's about the intelligence to really attract"},"665":{"dur":4,"text":"people to the information at large, to share\ncontent with it."},"670":{"dur":7,"text":"And so this particular scene is actually called\nX-Ray, and it's basically sharing the content"},"677":{"dur":6,"text":"of the building to the people on the street.\nAnd that's what I call interesting."},"683":{"dur":12,"text":"OK. The next project, and I'm going to sort\nof jump over this, is that within that time"},"696":{"dur":7,"text":"frame of Imaginary Forces, that project was\nonly up for two months, because of 9\/11. It"},"704":{"dur":8,"text":"was very unfortunate. That was the cause to\nsay, \"OK, I think my time is done here. Let"},"713":{"dur":1,"text":"me move on.\""},"714":{"dur":8,"text":"So, I moved on to a company that's pretty\nwell-known, to 2x4, to my professor, Michael"},"722":{"dur":6,"text":"Rock. I actually quit my job at Imaginary\nForces in the toilet. [laughs] I got a call,"},"729":{"dur":6,"text":"and I had to sit in the bathrooms and say,\n\"OK, yeah, I'll take the job.\" [laughs]"},"735":{"dur":7,"text":"And one of the projects that Michael put me\non, at first, was Vitra. I don't think I have"},"743":{"dur":7,"text":"anything to show for Vitra today. But, I also\ndid Prada as well. And it's a great opportunity"},"750":{"dur":8,"text":"that, one, you're just dropped into this particular\nrealm to do Prada. Oh, my God! That's crazy!"},"758":{"dur":8,"text":"And so, one of my first projects was this\nproject that I'm going to show you. And I"},"766":{"dur":10,"text":"was asked, I think it was about, I would say,\nfour o'clock in the afternoon, to design a"},"777":{"dur":6,"text":"one-ratio for Prada, the wallpaper. And I'm\nlike, \"Oh, my God. What am I going to do?\""},"783":{"dur":4,"text":"And they said, \"You must do it by 11 o'clock\ntomorrow morning.\" [laughs] And it's like,"},"787":{"dur":5,"text":"\"Oh, God, New York City is really a bad place\nfor me.\""},"792":{"dur":1,"text":"[laughter]"},"793":{"dur":5,"text":"Eddie: And so, what I did is I really thought\nabout typography.

And it was really"},"806":{"dur":4,"text":"for the men's show for Prada."},"810":{"dur":4,"text":"And then what I did is I said, \"Screw this.\nI need to do something a little bit more about"},"815":{"dur":6,"text":"me, my identity, who I want to be.\" And so\nI said, \"Let me do myself.\" Well, it doesn't"},"821":{"dur":7,"text":"really look like me. Well, depending on what\npart you look at..."},"828":{"dur":1,"text":"[laughter]"},"829":{"dur":3,"text":"Eddie: It sort of depends on what part."},"833":{"dur":7,"text":"Anyway. So, I developed this piece. And it\nwas actually at Christmastime, and I actually"},"840":{"dur":6,"text":"had to go on holiday. And Michael said, \"OK,\nwhat have you got?\" So I showed what I had."},"846":{"dur":4,"text":"And he's like, \"Oh, this is interesting. Can\nyou make this six-feet high?\" Six-foot-two,"},"851":{"dur":5,"text":"my height. And I'm like, \"Sure.\" So I printed\nout this piece that was six-feet high. He's"},"856":{"dur":6,"text":"like, \"OK, great.\" And then I just left to\ngo on holiday. I came back, and they did this."},"863":{"dur":1,"text":"[laughs]"},"864":{"dur":1,"text":"[laughter]"},"865":{"dur":10,"text":"Eddie: They took my body, [laughs] and they\nput it in the runway show. They took out particular"},"875":{"dur":2,"text":"bits, of course."},"877":{"dur":1,"text":"[laughter]"},"879":{"dur":9,"text":"Eddie: It was interesting. It's sort of like\nthis aspect of I didn't really care what Michael"},"888":{"dur":3,"text":"was going to do with it because I believed\nin what he was going to do. And it was like"},"892":{"dur":5,"text":"the idea not only of sharing your content\nbut knowing that that person's going to take"},"898":{"dur":2,"text":"it, even if he's your boss, or he's not your\nboss, he's going to take it and he's going"},"900":{"dur":4,"text":"to do something good with it. I don't care.\nWhoever takes my stuff is going to generate"},"905":{"dur":6,"text":"something out of it, and I'm always intrigued\nof what the result is going to be."},"912":{"dur":11,"text":"And [laughs] so I was very, very, very happy\nabout that. So, was Miuccia Prada. She said"},"923":{"dur":7,"text":"that she really loved the modeling, and she\nwanted it in the store in New York City. And"},"931":{"dur":10,"text":"so we started to produce another set of pieces\nfor the Epicenter. Michael said the same thing,"},"941":{"dur":6,"text":"\"Can you produce different modeling structures\nfor that particular store?\" And I said, \"Yes.\""},"948":{"dur":6,"text":"With help from one of my great friends, Fabian\nTejada, we produced pieces like this for the"},"954":{"dur":6,"text":"store. Usually, what would happen is handbag\nor watches or shoes would be stuck on there."},"961":{"dur":6,"text":"And we just wanted to make sort of a world\nthat Michael actually called \"The Futurama.\""},"967":{"dur":4,"text":"And this is downstairs. Have you ever gone\nto this store? You've got to go. It is really"},"972":{"dur":7,"text":"amazing. And the opportunity to do something\nlike that is fantastic. They have this sort"},"979":{"dur":4,"text":"of mirrored back of the staircase. The idea\nof reflecting off that was really intriguing."},"984":{"dur":3,"text":"I'll show you another piece that I did as\nwell in this particular store."},"988":{"dur":6,"text":"And actually, this is me, crouching on the\n2x4 floor, while Fabian is actually trying"},"994":{"dur":4,"text":"to sculpt me, [laughs] and then I colored\nthat from there."},"999":{"dur":6,"text":"So, these are particular alcoves, downstairs,\nin the bottom half of the store, and this"},"1006":{"dur":9,"text":"is how we sort of generated this whole world\nof the models. And it's more like the multiplicity"},"1015":{"dur":5,"text":"of Eddie has come about and created this."},"1021":{"dur":9,"text":"And so, also within the Prada store, you have\nscreens ubiquitously placed, serendipitously,"},"1031":{"dur":7,"text":"around the store. And you have the time frame\nthat you have to produce this; it's usually"},"1038":{"dur":6,"text":"about six weeks, to do everything. And this\nis just downstairs. And there was about 20"},"1044":{"dur":4,"text":"to 22 videos that we produced out of this\nwhole piece. You work very fast. [laughs]"},"1049":{"dur":8,"text":"We work very fast. It was just myself and\nFabian and, I think, Glen Cummings and Anisa"},"1057":{"dur":1,"text":"Suthayalai."},"1059":{"dur":5,"text":"One of the things about the pieces that you\nhave just seen that's sort of intriguing?and"},"1065":{"dur":8,"text":"you'll see some other video pieces in a second?is\nthat the work has been utilized in different"},"1073":{"dur":6,"text":"places. They loved it in the store in New\nYork. They loved it in Hong Kong. But, then"},"1080":{"dur":7,"text":"I got an email, and this is after I spent\nmy time at 2x4, from Michael. It's like, \"Check"},"1087":{"dur":6,"text":"this out. Your stuff is still being used,\ntwo years after the fact, in Taipei.\" [laughs]"},"1093":{"dur":7,"text":"And it's OMA-AMO, introducing the Taipei Tower.\nThey were having a party in the Taipei Tower"},"1101":{"dur":5,"text":"about this. And I don't know whether it was\na Prada party or not. And it was quite interesting"},"1106":{"dur":5,"text":"how they're using these video pieces that\nwe had created in that particular time frame."},"1112":{"dur":8,"text":"It's like, again, I don't mind people, I don't\ncare about sharing and utilizing. And it's"},"1120":{"dur":9,"text":"always amazing what they do with it. [laughs]\nSo I'm really quite happy about that."},"1130":{"dur":7,"text":"This is video from the Prada store itself\nthat we created. And do you recall the three"},"1137":{"dur":8,"text":"screens in that particular Bay Area? These\nare the particular videos that we created"},"1146":{"dur":5,"text":"from that. So, it was like a shuffling system.\nWe didn't have that much time to produce them,"},"1151":{"dur":7,"text":"so we started to create a sort of jukebox-y\nsystem to actually keep changing over the"},"1159":{"dur":6,"text":"videos from time to time to time. And it was\na good structure to utilize."},"1165":{"dur":7,"text":"And throughout the whole store, you have all\nthese different models doing different things."},"1173":{"dur":9,"text":"So, it's really the extrapolation of the work\nthat came out of me modeling myself, and it's"},"1182":{"dur":1,"text":"now generated this."},"1184":{"dur":15,"text":"Again, here is another video, running in the\nstore itself. If I fast-forward this, I think"},"1200":{"dur":5,"text":"I can get a different video here."},"1205":{"dur":9,"text":"So, we did different models from different\nangles. They had mannequins sitting on different"},"1215":{"dur":6,"text":"modeling sets. So, they have these all pitted\naround the actual store. So, it was really"},"1221":{"dur":5,"text":"an interesting, intriguing project to deal\nwith."},"1226":{"dur":8,"text":"This is also downstairs in the alcove area.\nAnd these are sort of title screens with the"},"1235":{"dur":8,"text":"models walking around, up and down these particular\nscreens."},"1243":{"dur":13,"text":"My last project at 2x4 was quite interesting.\nMichael received a call from Rem Koolhaas,"},"1257":{"dur":6,"text":"stating that the next theme should be a multinational\ncompany invading the Prada store, in this"},"1264":{"dur":7,"text":"very Rem Koolhaas-y kind of manner. So, Michael\nexplains this to me, and he gives me full"},"1271":{"dur":2,"text":"reign of doing whatever I needed to do."},"1274":{"dur":6,"text":"And so I was kind of interested in the idea\nof the word \"Guilt,\" actually without a \"U\""},"1280":{"dur":10,"text":"to guilt something, to frame it in a particular\nmanner, as it were. And Michael told me to"},"1290":{"dur":5,"text":"change it to a \"U\" because he really wanted\nit to stand out, and no New Yorker's going"},"1296":{"dur":6,"text":"to understand G-I-L-T. And so we did that.\nAnd the funny thing. This is pretty much where"},"1303":{"dur":6,"text":"I'm standing. This is the entrance to the\nstore. So, let's say you have $5000 to burn,"},"1309":{"dur":2,"text":"and you open the door and you see that."},"1312":{"dur":1,"text":"[laughter]"},"1313":{"dur":4,"text":"Eddie: It was just like, \"Wow, these guys\nhave full reign on doing these things.\""},"1318":{"dur":8,"text":"And so the whole idea of this sort of false\nmultinational company was?and this wallpaper"},"1326":{"dur":11,"text":"is actually also a block long?to create wallpaper\nthat showed you the brand identity of \"Guilt,\""},"1337":{"dur":7,"text":"and the dos and don'ts of the system. Also,\nit's quite fun and sort of intriguing to do"},"1345":{"dur":8,"text":"that, because how many people, in their lifetime,\nactually see [laughs] brand structuring? Not"},"1354":{"dur":10,"text":"many at all. So, these are the particular\nitems that have been created, from this imaginary"},"1365":{"dur":3,"text":"brand."},"1368":{"dur":9,"text":"Also, benches that people sit on, and how\nmodular they are. Also, downstairs. So, the"},"1377":{"dur":4,"text":"idea, the mirror actually shows you the word\n\"Guilt.\" So, when it's printed on the floor,"},"1381":{"dur":3,"text":"it's actually the other way. It's reverse.\nSo, when you're sort of looking up, saying,"},"1384":{"dur":5,"text":"\"Oh, I love this bag!\" and you look around\nand turn and see \"Guilt.\" It's like, great."},"1390":{"dur":1,"text":"[laughter]"},"1392":{"dur":7,"text":"Eddie: Also in Thai. This is from Denise.\nShe did this."},"1399":{"dur":9,"text":"And sort of brings me to an identity that\n2x4 is getting pretty well-known for that"},"1409":{"dur":9,"text":"I designed when I was there. And it also sort\nof embodies what I'm thinking of in regards"},"1418":{"dur":9,"text":"to the flexibility of a brand identity, the\nidea of it not always changing, but ever-growing"},"1428":{"dur":8,"text":"into something else, or the idea that it has\ndifferent values in different manners, depending"},"1436":{"dur":3,"text":"on the way you use it."},"1440":{"dur":8,"text":"This is all the Brooklyn Museum logos put\ntogether as one.
