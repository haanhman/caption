it out."},"74":{"dur":3,"text":"And it won an Oscar in 2008\nfor Best Short Subject."},"78":{"dur":2,"text":"So shortly after that, Michael\nShamberg and Stacey Sher--"},"80":{"dur":2,"text":"producers on the project--\nsent me the documentary"},"83":{"dur":3,"text":"and asked if I would like to\nattach myself to play Stacie."},"87":{"dur":2,"text":"And I watched it,\nand I was weeping."},"89":{"dur":1,"text":"I was so moved."},"91":{"dur":3,"text":"And I said yes immediately."},"94":{"dur":1,"text":"And then they were very\ngracious and generous"},"96":{"dur":2,"text":"and involved me in the\ndevelopment process."},"99":{"dur":3,"text":"And so we found Ron\nNyswaner with the screenplay"},"102":{"dur":2,"text":"and then Pete Sollett and Julie."},"105":{"dur":0,"text":"JULIANNE MOORE: Yeah."},"106":{"dur":0,"text":"Yeah."},"107":{"dur":2,"text":"KEVIN VLK: Because you were\ninvolved for seven years."},"109":{"dur":1,"text":"You're a producer\non the film as well."},"111":{"dur":2,"text":"So the casting of just Julianne."},"113":{"dur":1,"text":"So what stage was that in?"},"117":{"dur":3,"text":"ELLEN PAGE: I mean, we were\nshooting the film a year ago."},"120":{"dur":1,"text":"And you said yes."},"121":{"dur":1,"text":"JULIANNE MOORE: In February."},"123":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah, so this time last\nyear we were actually"},"125":{"dur":2,"text":"shooting the film in New York."},"127":{"dur":3,"text":"But, yeah, it was February\nwhen I first met with Pete"},"131":{"dur":1,"text":"and talked to Ellen."},"132":{"dur":2,"text":"And, yeah, so it wasn't\nthat long ago really."},"135":{"dur":1,"text":"A year and a half or so I guess."},"137":{"dur":2,"text":"REBECCA PROZAN: There are\nthousands of same-sex couples"},"140":{"dur":2,"text":"that have had unfortunately\nsimilar situations to this."},"142":{"dur":3,"text":"Was there something about the\nstory itself or the

MOORE:\nWell, the documentary"},"152":{"dur":1,"text":"is pretty extraordinary."},"153":{"dur":4,"text":"I think the degree of\nintimacy with which"},"157":{"dur":2,"text":"you experience it is unusual."},"159":{"dur":2,"text":"The fact that they\nallowed a documentarian"},"162":{"dur":4,"text":"in their home every single\nday during the last year"},"166":{"dur":4,"text":"of Laurel's life,\nit's very unusual."},"170":{"dur":5,"text":"So I think you get just a\npalpable sense of who they are"},"176":{"dur":4,"text":"and what they were up against\nand what discrimination really"},"180":{"dur":4,"text":"What are the costs of\nsomething that seems"},"185":{"dur":2,"text":"innately political when you\nrealize that they're talking"},"187":{"dur":1,"text":"about losing

because I saw it"},"197":{"dur":2,"text":"on Monday-- that she would be\nsort of a difficult character"},"200":{"dur":2,"text":"to get to know and\nto learn about."},"202":{"dur":0,"text":"She's complex."},"203":{"dur":1,"text":"JULIANNE MOORE: She is, yeah."},"204":{"dur":1,"text":"REBECCA PROZAN: She's\na little distant."},"206":{"dur":2,"text":"She's a cop and not\nsomeone who is

Well,\ninterestingly enough,"},"215":{"dur":2,"text":"the cop part was the\nhardest part for me."},"218":{"dur":1,"text":"The relationship part was easy."},"219":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, that I understand."},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"That's something I think we're\nall familiar with, you know,"},"224":{"dur":1,"text":"how you fall in\nlove with somebody"},"225":{"dur":1,"text":"and build a life with them."},"226":{"dur":1,"text":"But for me, being\na police officer"},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"was really, really different."},"230":{"dur":4,"text":"And, of course, I had\nthe Laurel in the doc."},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I had the Laurel\nwho was not well."},"236":{"dur":3,"text":"But I did not know the\nLaurel who was healthy."},"239":{"dur":1,"text":"And that was really\nprovided to me"},"241":{"dur":2,"text":"by Stacie Andree herself,\nwho opened her home to us"},"244":{"dur":1,"text":"and showed us all of\nthese newspaper clippings"},"246":{"dur":3,"text":"and photographs and\nshared her memories,"},"250":{"dur":3,"text":"and also Dane Wells,\nwho was Laurel's police"},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"partner, and Laurel's\nbrother and sister."},"255":{"dur":1,"text":"And so with all of\nthat information"},"257":{"dur":4,"text":"I was able to figure\nout who that Laurel was."},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"And what was\ninteresting is that I"},"264":{"dur":3,"text":"think because she was such a\npolice officer, really believed"},"268":{"dur":1,"text":"in the justice\nsystem, and really"},"269":{"dur":1,"text":"believed in doing\nthe right thing,"},"271":{"dur":3,"text":"that kind of moral fiber--\nher ethics were truly"},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"what drove her to do the\nright thing for the woman"},"277":{"dur":1,"text":"that she loved."},"279":{"dur":3,"text":"KEVIN VLK: And obviously this\nis based on a true story."},"282":{"dur":1,"text":"These are real characters."},"283":{"dur":3,"text":"Is there a sense of fear\nor real responsibility?"},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"Because you are adapting\nand you are actually"},"289":{"dur":3,"text":"acting as real people who really\nexisted and do still exist."},"292":{"dur":0,"text":"ELLEN PAGE: For sure."},"293":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, we all felt a\nsense of responsibility"},"297":{"dur":7,"text":"and wanted Stacie and\nDane to feel safe,"},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"essentially, to have them\nknow that our goal was"},"307":{"dur":3,"text":"to make something as truthful\nand as honest and as authentic"},"310":{"dur":1,"text":"as possible."},"312":{"dur":4,"text":"And so we would text Stacie\nor communicate with her"},"317":{"dur":1,"text":"while we were shooting."},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"And then she came\nto set for a day."},"320":{"dur":3,"text":"You can see her in the film\nat the end at a certain point."},"324":{"dur":3,"text":"And, yeah, so I think you feel\na sense of responsibility."},"327":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's probably what we\nput most of our thought into,"},"331":{"dur":0,"text":"I would say."},"332":{"dur":1,"text":"JULIANNE MOORE: Yeah."},"333":{"dur":1,"text":"REBECCA PROZAN: I think you\ntouched on this a little bit,"},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"but how involved was she in\nthe development of the film?"},"337":{"dur":2,"text":"Was she on set?"},"339":{"dur":2,"text":"Were you asking her for advice?"},"342":{"dur":0,"text":"ELLEN PAGE: She was--"},"343":{"dur":0,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"347":{"dur":1,"text":"She was really involved."},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, she Ron Nyswaner\nspent a lot of time--"},"350":{"dur":4,"text":"the screenwriter-- with\nStacie and with Dane"},"355":{"dur":3,"text":"and with Steven Goldstein,\nwho Steve Carell plays."},"358":{"dur":3,"text":"And then we both spent\na lot of time with her."},"362":{"dur":3,"text":"And she was just so kind to us."},"365":{"dur":4,"text":"And as you can imagine, a\nlot of the conversations"},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"are difficult and\nemotional, the ones"},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"about the good times and the\nones about the difficult times."},"374":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's all her having to bring\nthat back up to the surface."},"378":{"dur":1,"text":"REBECCA PROZAN: It's\nsort of interesting"},"380":{"dur":3,"text":"because she also seems\nunwilling to participate"},"383":{"dur":0,"text":"through the movie."},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's almost sweet that\nshe-- and maybe that's not"},"387":{"dur":3,"text":"the right word-- and compelling\nthat she was so participatory."},"390":{"dur":1,"text":"ELLEN PAGE: Well,\nI think it truly"},"392":{"dur":5,"text":"is a reflection of her love\nand dedication towards Laurel."},"397":{"dur":3,"text":"And Cynthia Wade, when she\nwas making the documentary,"},"400":{"dur":3,"text":"did ask Laurel, how would\nyou feel if people would"},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"want to fictionalize this?"},"405":{"dur":3,"text":"Is that something that you'd be\nwilling to give the rights to?"},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"And she was like,\npff, as if someone"},"411":{"dur":2,"text":"would want to do that-- of\ncourse was her response."},"413":{"dur":4,"text":"But she was absolutely-- I would\nwant as many people as possible"},"417":{"dur":4,"text":"to know about our story and\nwhat the community goes through."},"422":{"dur":3,"text":"KEVIN VLK: In doing your\nresearch on Laurel and Stacie"},"425":{"dur":4,"text":"and their story and\nDane and everything--"},"429":{"dur":1,"text":"you're watching a\nfilm but you have"},"431":{"dur":0,"text":"to keep it in the\nback of your mind"},"432":{"dur":1,"text":"that this actually happened."},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"This is a real story."},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"And what's really\ngut-wrenching is"},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"that not only were\nthey fighting cancer,"},"440":{"dur":4,"text":"they were fighting\nnot just gay marriage,"},"444":{"dur":1,"text":"it was marriage equality."},"446":{"dur":3,"text":"And they allowed a\ndocumentary film and directly"},"449":{"dur":1,"text":"to come into their lives."},"450":{"dur":3,"text":"So can you talk about just\nmeeting Stacie and talking"},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"with them about what brought\nthat decision and was like,"},"456":{"dur":1,"text":"yeah, we're OK with this."},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"That the last year of my life--\nour lives together-- we're"},"460":{"dur":0,"text":"going to do this."},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"JULIANNE MOORE: It was Dane\nwho really spearheaded it."},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, that's\nwhat's interesting is"},"465":{"dur":3,"text":"that Dane, I think,\ncame into their lives"},"469":{"dur":3,"text":"and had a sense of outrage about\nhow they were being treated"},"472":{"dur":1,"text":"and wanted to make a difference."},"474":{"dur":5,"text":"And so he began to organize the\npress coverage of their fight."},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"And he was the one that fielded\nthe calls from filmmakers."},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"And he brought\nCynthia Wade to them"},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"because he liked the way\nCynthia sounded on his answering"},"488":{"dur":1,"text":"machine."},"489":{"dur":4,"text":"So I think probably the least\nacquiescent partner was Stacie"},"493":{"dur":3,"text":"because she was just trying\nto take care of Laurel."},"497":{"dur":3,"text":"But I think that they\nbegan to feel compelled"},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"to do the right thing simply\nbecause of what was happening."},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"But I think without Dane\nI don't know that this all"},"505":{"dur":0,"text":"would have happened."},"506":{"dur":3,"text":"He really was quite heroic\nand really, really protective"},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"of them and of their story."},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"REBECCA PROZAN: You talked about\nthis earlier, too, Julianne,"},"514":{"dur":4,"text":"but for both of you, this movie\nis about justice and equality"},"519":{"dur":7,"text":"and really same sex marriage\nand rights for same sex couples."},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"Did you think it was interesting\nthat Laurel said time"},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"and time again, I'm not\nfighting for marriage,"},"531":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm fighting for quality."},"532":{"dur":1,"text":"JULIANNE MOORE: I\nlove that about her."},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, I love that\nshe refused to be"},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"political about something."},"537":{"dur":3,"text":"She was not there to do what\nSteven Goldstein wanted."},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"They both needed\neach other, clearly."},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"Laurel and Stacie needed Steven\nGoldstein to bring attention"},"545":{"dur":0,"text":"to their cause."},"546":{"dur":4,"text":"And Steven Goldstein wanted\nthem to move his agenda forward,"},"551":{"dur":5,"text":"And I think it was\nan uneasy alliance."},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"They both wanted\ndifferent things."},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"And, as I said, I think\nit was Laurel's ethics"},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"that made her say,\nno, I'm not fighting"},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"for a political movement."},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm fighting for what is fair."},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"Edie Windsor said,\nLaurel Hester is"},"573":{"dur":3,"text":"a hero for asking to be treated\nexactly like everybody else."},"576":{"dur":4,"text":"So I think those degrees\nwere important to her,"},"580":{"dur":4,"text":"that that distinction\nthat legally they"},"585":{"dur":0,"text":"should have had this."},"586":{"dur":4,"text":"It was only a loophole in the\nlaw that allowed the benefits"},"590":{"dur":1,"text":"to be decided by the county."},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"Corzine just had not\nclosed that loophole."},"595":{"dur":1,"text":"KEVIN VLK: Yeah."},"596":{"dur":5,"text":"And it's such a beautiful\nmovie and a great movie"},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"where you're asking people who\nhave these certain beliefs--"},"604":{"dur":1,"text":"these Freeholders essentially."},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's millions\nout there like them."},"608":{"dur":3,"text":"We're not asking you to\neven just believe in this."},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"We're actually asking you\njust for your support, right?"},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"And so it's like, we're not\ntrying to change your beliefs."},"616":{"dur":1,"text":"If you believe one\nthing, that's fine."},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"So how were they able to succeed\nin that with the Freeholders"},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"where it was like, you\nhave to accept this?"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"ELLEN PAGE: I think it\nwas just all the pressure."},"624":{"dur":1,"text":"JULIANNE MOORE: It was\njust political pressure."},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"ELLEN PAGE: And then\nwhen it was happening,"},"628":{"dur":6,"text":"too, every county around Ocean\nCounty fixed the loophole."},"635":{"dur":2,"text":"And so they were\njust surrounded."},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"And the pressure was strong."},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"JULIANNE MOORE:\nCorzine called them--"},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"ELLEN PAGE: And then\nCorzine called them."},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"JULIANNE MOORE: --and\nsaid like, this is enough."},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"It's embarrassing."},"646":{"dur":1,"text":"So, yeah, but it was\npolitical pressure."},"648":{"dur":1,"text":"ELLEN PAGE: Yeah, and it's true."},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"And for those who've seen\nthe film, for example,"},"652":{"dur":4,"text":"when the certain Freeholder\ndoesn't show up to the meeting,"},"656":{"dur":0,"text":"that was true."},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"And he was \"on\nvacation,\" but he wasn't."},"659":{"dur":6,"text":"So it's all very accurate\nto what happened."},"665":{"dur":1,"text":"REBECCA PROZAN:\nEllen, this movie,"},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"it's a powerful statement about\nchanging hearts and minds."},"670":{"dur":2,"text":"And during the seven\nyears, the country"},"672":{"dur":3,"text":"changed with the\nproduction of the movie."},"676":{"dur":3,"text":"Polls consistently show more\nsupport for civil rights,"},"679":{"dur":1,"text":"right?"},"680":{"dur":2,"text":"Did that change, did\nthat sea change, change"},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"how you marketed\nthe movie, thought"},"686":{"dur":1,"text":"about who should be\nin the movie, anything"},"687":{"dur":2,"text":"about how it was produced\nor anything about--"},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"ELLEN PAGE: I don't\nthink so at all actually."},"693":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, we were\nalways trying to make"},"695":{"dur":1,"text":"the movie we were\ntrying to make,"},"697":{"dur":3,"text":"which was an honest reflection\nof their experience."},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"And what has been actually\ninteresting in watching it--"},"703":{"dur":5,"text":"even at the premiere recently\nafter a lot of the backlash"},"708":{"dur":3,"text":"post the recent, awesome\nSupreme Court decision-- there"},"712":{"dur":3,"text":"was all of these new--\nthere's definitely new things"},"715":{"dur":3,"text":"that I was noticing after a\nlot of the dialogue that's"},"719":{"dur":1,"text":"been happening."},"721":{"dur":3,"text":"But, no, I don't think\nanything was necessarily"},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"adjusted or changed in any way."},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"KEVIN VLK: And what were\nsome of your favorite scenes"},"728":{"dur":4,"text":"to shoot together and some of\nthe most toughest ones, too?"},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"I love this scene at the\nbeginning, just the, hey,"},"735":{"dur":0,"text":"can I have your number?"},"736":{"dur":1,"text":"And you have the\nwriting on the arm."},"738":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's so cute."},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"You're like, oh, OK."},"740":{"dur":1,"text":"And you go there."},"742":{"dur":2,"text":"It's absolutely adorable."},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"It's great."},"746":{"dur":0,"text":"I mean, that's mine."},"747":{"dur":3,"text":"But what were your\nfavorite scenes to shoot?"},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"It's about me, guys."},"753":{"dur":2,"text":"No, but really, so what\nwere some of the fun ones,"},"755":{"dur":1,"text":"but also what were the\nmost complicated ones,"},"757":{"dur":1,"text":"the toughest ones to shoot?"},"758":{"dur":0,"text":"JULIANNE MOORE: We loved it all."},"759":{"dur":0,"text":"JULIANNE MOORE: We did."},"760":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, honestly it was such a\ndelight to go to work every day"},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"and to have Ellen there as\nmy partner on screen and off."},"766":{"dur":6,"text":"And I think just\nbeing together-- well,"},"773":{"dur":1,"text":"we were just a team."},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"So everything felt\nlike something"},"776":{"dur":1,"text":"that we were maneuvering\nand discovering."},"778":{"dur":0,"text":"For sure."},"779":{"dur":1,"text":"JULIANNE MOORE: Yeah,\nyeah, we really were."},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"But, I mean, that being said,\nI always like the happy stuff"},"784":{"dur":2,"text":"better than the sad stuff."},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"My favorite thing was the date\nwhere she brings me a soda"},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"and I have to say, you\nknow, I'm older than you."},"791":{"dur":1,"text":"And she was like,\nah, yeah, whatever."},"792":{"dur":1,"text":"And then we dance."},"794":{"dur":4,"text":"And it was just a really\nfun, beautiful night."},"798":{"dur":1,"text":"And we had gotten to know\neach other very well."},"800":{"dur":1,"text":"We shot that
