is a perfect\nanalogy for"},"118":{"dur":2,"text":"what we're going to be talking about\ntoday."},"120":{"dur":3,"text":"The vast majority of us in this room, very\nsmart people in this room,"},"124":{"dur":3,"text":"were not as effective as we could have\nbeen in this activity."},"127":{"dur":1,"text":"We didn't get it right."},"129":{"dur":3,"text":"And the same is true when it comes to\nspeaking in public,"},"133":{"dur":2,"text":"particularly when spontaneous speaking."},"135":{"dur":4,"text":"It's little things that make a big\ndifference in being affective."},"139":{"dur":3,"text":"So today we're going to talk about little\nthings in terms of your approach, your"},"143":{"dur":4,"text":"attitude, your practice, that can change\nhow you feel when you speak in public."},"149":{"dur":2,"text":"And we're gonna be talking primarily about\none type of public speaking."},"154":{"dur":2,"text":"Not the type that you plan for in advance,\nthe type"},"156":{"dur":4,"text":"that you actually spend time thinking\nabout, you might even create slides for."},"161":{"dur":4,"text":"These are the key notes, the conference\npresentation, the formal toasts."},"167":{"dur":1,"text":"That's not what we are talking about\ntoday,"},"168":{"dur":2,"text":"we are talking about spontaneous speaking."},"172":{"dur":3,"text":"When you are in a situation that you are\nasked to speak off the cuff and"},"176":{"dur":0,"text":"in the moment."},"178":{"dur":3,"text":"What we're going through today is actually\nthe result of a workshop I"},"181":{"dur":2,"text":"created here for the business school."},"184":{"dur":3,"text":"Several years ago, a survey was taken\namong the students, and they said, what's"},"187":{"dur":3,"text":"one of the, what are things we could do to\nhelp make you more successful here?"},"191":{"dur":4,"text":"And at the top of that list was this\nnotion of responding to cold calls."},"195":{"dur":1,"text":"Does everybody know what a cold call is?"},"197":{"dur":3,"text":"It's where the mean professor like me\nlooks at some student and"},"200":{"dur":0,"text":"says, what do you think?"},"202":{"dur":1,"text":"And there was a lot of panic, and a lot of\nsilence."},"206":{"dur":2,"text":"So as a result of that, this workshop was\ncreated, and"},"208":{"dur":4,"text":"a vast majority of first year students\nhere at the GSB go through this workshop."},"212":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'm gonna walk you through sort of a\nhybrid version of what they do."},"217":{"dur":3,"text":"The reality is that spontaneous speaking\nis actually more"},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"prevalent than planned speaking."},"223":{"dur":1,"text":"Perhaps it's giving introductions."},"225":{"dur":3,"text":"somebody says, you know so and so, would\nyou mind introducing them?"},"229":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe it's giving feedback."},"230":{"dur":2,"text":"In the moment, your boss turns to you and\nsays, would you tell me what you think?"},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"It could be a surprise toast."},"236":{"dur":3,"text":"Or finally, it could be during the Q and A\nsession."},"239":{"dur":0,"text":"And by the way,"},"240":{"dur":3,"text":"we will leave plenty of time at the end of\nour day today for Q and A."},"244":{"dur":2,"text":"I'd love to hear the questions you have\nabout this topic or"},"246":{"dur":1,"text":"other topics related to communicating."},"250":{"dur":4,"text":"So our agenda is simple, in order to be an\neffective communicator, regardless of if"},"255":{"dur":3,"text":"it's planned or spontaneous, you need to\nhave your anxiety under control."},"260":{"dur":1,"text":"So we'll start there."},"262":{"dur":3,"text":"Second, what we're going to talk about is\nsome ground rules for"},"266":{"dur":1,"text":"the interactivity we'll have today and"},"268":{"dur":3,"text":"then finally we're going to get into the\nheart of what we will be covering and"},"271":{"dur":3,"text":"again, as I said, lots of activity and I\ninvite you to participate."},"277":{"dur":1,"text":"So lets get started with anxiety\nmanagement."},"279":{"dur":5,"text":"85% of people tell us that they're nervous\nwhen speaking in public."},"284":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think the other 15% are lying."},"287":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay?\nWe could create a situation where we"},"289":{"dur":1,"text":"could make them nervous too."},"291":{"dur":5,"text":"In fact, just this past week a study from\nChapman University asked American's,"},"296":{"dur":2,"text":"what are the things you fear most?"},"298":{"dur":3,"text":"And among being caught in a surprise\nterrorist attack,"},"302":{"dur":3,"text":"having identity, your identity stolen, was\npublic speaking."},"305":{"dur":2,"text":"Among the top five was speaking in front\nof others."},"309":{"dur":4,"text":"This is a ubiquitous fear, and one that I\nbelieve we can learn to manage."},"313":{"dur":4,"text":"And I use that word manage very carefully\nbecause I"},"317":{"dur":2,"text":"don't think we ever want to overcome it."},"320":{"dur":1,"text":"Anxiety actually helps us."},"322":{"dur":3,"text":"It gives us energy, helps us focus, tells\nus what we're doing is important."},"326":{"dur":2,"text":"But we want to learn to manage it."},"328":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'd like to introduce you to a few\ntechniques that can work and"},"331":{"dur":3,"text":"all of these techniques are based on\nacademic research."},"334":{"dur":5,"text":"But before we get there, I'd love to ask\nyou what does it feel like"},"339":{"dur":3,"text":"when you're sitting in the audience\nwatching a nervous speaker present,"},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"how do you feel, just shout out a few\nthings, how to do you feel?"},"346":{"dur":1,"text":">> Uncomfortable."},"348":{"dur":1,"text":"I heard many of you going, yes,\nuncomfortable."},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"It feels very awkward, doesn't it?"},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"Now a couple of you probably like watching\nsomebody suffer."},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"[LAUGH] 'Kay, but most of us don't."},"358":{"dur":4,"text":"We sit there and we nod and we smile or we\ndisengage."},"364":{"dur":1,"text":"And to the nervous speaker looking out at\nhis or"},"366":{"dur":4,"text":"her audience seeing a bunch of people\nnodding or disengaged, that does not help."},"370":{"dur":1,"text":"Okay.\nSo we need to manage our anxiety."},"372":{"dur":3,"text":"Cuz, fundamentally, your job as a\ncommunicator rather, regardless of"},"375":{"dur":4,"text":"if it's planned or spontaneous, is to make\nyour audience comfortable."},"380":{"dur":3,"text":"Because if they're comfortable they can\nreceive your message."},"383":{"dur":3,"text":"And when I say comfortable I am not\nreferring to the fact that"},"386":{"dur":4,"text":"your message has to be sugar coated and\nnice for them to hear."},"390":{"dur":1,"text":"It can be a harsh message."},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"But they have to be in a place where they\ncan receive it."},"395":{"dur":5,"text":"So it's incumbent on you as a communicator\nto help your audience feel comfortable and"},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"we do that by managing our anxiety."},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"So let me introduce you to a few\ntechniques that I think you can"},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"use right away to help you feel more\ncomfortable."},"410":{"dur":3,"text":"The first has to do with when you begin to\nfeel those anxiety symptoms."},"414":{"dur":3,"text":"For most people this happens the, in the\ninitial minutes prior to speaking."},"419":{"dur":3,"text":"In this situation what happens is many of\nus begin to feel whatever it"},"422":{"dur":0,"text":"is that happens to you."},"423":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe your stomach gets a little gurgly."},"425":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe your legs begin to shake."},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe you begin to perspire."},"429":{"dur":4,"text":"And then we start to say to ourselves, oh,\nmy goodness, I'm nervous."},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"oh.\nThey're gonna tell I'm nervous."},"435":{"dur":1,"text":"This is not gonna go well."},"436":{"dur":1,"text":"And we start spiraling out of control."},"439":{"dur":3,"text":"So, research on mindful attention tells us\nthat if,"},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"when we begin to feel those anxiety\nsymptoms,"},"445":{"dur":5,"text":"we simply greet our anxiety and say hey,\nthis is me feeling nervous."},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm about to do something of consequence."},"454":{"dur":3,"text":"And simply by greeting your anxiety and\nacknowledging it,"},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"that it's normal and natural."},"459":{"dur":1,"text":"Heck, 85% of people tell us they have it."},"462":{"dur":4,"text":"You actually can stem the tide of that\nanxiety spiraling out of control."},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not necessarily going to reduce the\nanxiety but"},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"it will stop it from spinning out."},"471":{"dur":3,"text":"So the next time you begin to feel those\nanxiety signs,"},"475":{"dur":3,"text":"take a deep breath and say, this is me\nfeeling anxious."},"480":{"dur":1,"text":"I notice a few of you taking some notes."},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a handout that will come at the\nend."},"484":{"dur":4,"text":"It has everything that I'm supposed to\nsay, okay?"},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"Can't guarantee I'm gonna say it, but\nyou'll have it there."},"492":{"dur":3,"text":"In addition to this approach, a technique\nthat works very well, and"},"495":{"dur":3,"text":"this is a technique that I helped do some\nresearch on way back when I was in"},"498":{"dur":5,"text":"graduate school, has to do with re-framing\nhow you see the speaking situation."},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"Most of us, when we are up presenting,\nplanned or"},"508":{"dur":6,"text":"spontaneous, we feel that we have to do it\nright and we feel like we are performing."},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"How many of you have ever acted, done\nsinging or"},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"dancing, I am not going to ask for\nperformances now, okay."},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"Many of you have."},"520":{"dur":3,"text":"We should note that we could do next year,\nmaybe, a talent show of alums."},"524":{"dur":1,"text":"It looks like we got the talent there."},"525":{"dur":0,"text":"That's great."},"527":{"dur":3,"text":"So when you perform, you know that there's\na right way and a wrong way to do it."},"530":{"dur":4,"text":"If you don't hit your, the right note or\nyou right line at the right time,"},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"at the right place, you've made a mistake."},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"It messes up the audience."},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"It messes up the people on stage."},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"But when you present, there is no right\nway."},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"There's certainly better and worse ways."},"547":{"dur":1,"text":"But there is no one right way."},"549":{"dur":3,"text":"So we need to look at presenting as\nsomething other than performance."},"553":{"dur":4,"text":"And what I'd like to suggest is what we\nneed to see this is as is a conversation."},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"Right now, I'm having a conversation with\n100 plus people."},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"Rather than saying I'm performing for you."},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"But it's not enough just to say, this is a\nconversation."},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"I want to give you some concrete things\nyou can do."},"572":{"dur":3,"text":"First, start with questions."},"576":{"dur":3,"text":"Questions by their very nature are\ndialogic, they're two way."},"579":{"dur":4,"text":"What was one of the very first things I\ndid here for you?"},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"I had you count the number of fs and raise\nyour hands."},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"I asked you a question."},"587":{"dur":1,"text":"That gets your audience involved,"},"589":{"dur":4,"text":"it makes it feel to me as the presenter as\nif we're in conversation."},"593":{"dur":1,"text":"So, use questions."},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"They can be rhetorical."},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"They can be polling, perhaps I actually\nwant to hear information from you."},"600":{"dur":4,"text":"In fact, I use questions when I create an\noutline for my presentations."},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"Rather than writing bullet points, I list\nquestions that I'm going to answer."},"608":{"dur":3,"text":"And that puts me in that conversational\nmode."},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"If you were to look at my notes for"},"613":{"dur":3,"text":"today's talk, you'll see it's just a\nseries of questions."},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"Right now I'm answering the question, how\ndo we manage our anxiety?"},"621":{"dur":2,"text":"Beyond questions, another very useful\ntechnique for"},"624":{"dur":4,"text":"making us conversational is to use\nconversational language."},"630":{"dur":3,"text":"Many nervous speakers distance themselves\nphysically."},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"If you\u2019ve ever seen a nervous speaker\npresent, he or"},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"she will say something like this."},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"Welcome, I am really excited to be here\nwith you."},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"They pull as far away from you as\npossible,"},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"because you threaten us, speakers."},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"You make us nervous so we want to get away\nfrom you."},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"We do the same thing linguistically."},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"We use language that distances ourselves."},"653":{"dur":3,"text":"It's not unusual to hear a nervous speaker\nsay something like,"},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"one must consider the ramifications."},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"Or, today we're going to cover step one,\nstep two, step three."},"663":{"dur":1,"text":"That's very distancing language."},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"To be more conversational, use\nconversational language."},"668":{"dur":1,"text":"Instead of one must consider say,"},"670":{"dur":3,"text":"this is important to you, we all need to\nbe concerned with."},"673":{"dur":3,"text":"Do you hear that inclusive conversational\nlanguage?"},"676":{"dur":1,"text":"Has to do with the pronouns."},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"Instead of step 1, step, 2, step 3."},"681":{"dur":5,"text":"First what we need to do is this, the\nsecond thing you should consider is here."},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"Use conversational language, so"},"688":{"dur":3,"text":"being conversational can also help you\nmanage your anxiety."},"693":{"dur":3,"text":"The third technique I would like to share\nis research that I actually started when I"},"696":{"dur":2,"text":"was an undergraduate here, I was very\nfortunate to study with"},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"Phil Zimbardo of the Stanford Prison\nexperiment fame."},"703":{"dur":5,"text":"Many people don't know that Zim actually\nwas instrumental in starting one of"},"709":{"dur":4,"text":"the very first shyness institutes in the,\nthe world and especially in the country."},"713":{"dur":5,"text":"And I did some research with him that\nlooked at how your orientation to time"},"718":{"dur":1,"text":"influences how you react."},"721":{"dur":3,"text":"And what we learned is if you can bring\nyourself into the present moment,"},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"rather than being worried about the future\nconsequences,"},"729":{"dur":1,"text":"you can actually be less nervous."},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"Most of us, when we present, are worried\nabout the future consequences."},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"My students are worried they're not going\nto get the right grade."},"737":{"dur":1,"text":"Some of you are worried you might not get\nthe funding."},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"You might not get the support."},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"You might not get the laughs that you\nwant."},"743":{"dur":1,"text":"All of those are future states."},"744":{"dur":4,"text":"So if we can bring ourselves into the\npresent moment, we're not going to be"},"749":{"dur":3,"text":"as concerned about those future states and\ntherefore we will be less nervous."},"753":{"dur":1,"text":"There are lots of ways to become present\noriented."},"756":{"dur":4,"text":"I know a professional speaker, he's paid\n$10,000 an hour to speak."},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a good gig."},"763":{"dur":0,"text":"He gets very nervous."},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"He's up in front of crowds of thousands."},"767":{"dur":3,"text":"Behind the stage what he does is 100\npush-ups right before he comes out."},"770":{"dur":4,"text":"[LAUGH] You can't be that physically\nactive and not be in the present moment."},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, I'm not recommending all of us go to\nthat level of exertion cuz he"},"778":{"dur":2,"text":"starts out out of breath and sweaty, okay?"},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"[LAUGH] But a walk around the building\nbefore you speak."},"784":{"dur":1,"text":"That can do it.\nThere are other ways."},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"If you've ever watched athletes perform\nand"},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"get ready to do their event, they listen\nto music."},"790":{"dur":3,"text":"They focus on a song or a playlist that\nhelps get them in the moment."},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"You can do things as simple as counting\nbackwards from 100"},"797":{"dur":0,"text":"by tough number like 17."},"798":{"dur":5,"text":"I'm gonna pause 'cuz I know people in the\nroom are trying."},"803":{"dur":0,"text":"Yeah."},"804":{"dur":2,"text":"Get's hard after that third or fourth one,\nI know."},"807":{"dur":3,"text":"My favorite way to get present-oriented is\nto say tongue twisters."},"811":{"dur":2,"text":"Saying a tongue twister forces you to be\nin the moment."},"814":{"dur":1,"text":"Otherwise you'll say it wrong."},"815":{"dur":2,"text":"And it has the added benefit of warming up\nyour voice."},"818":{"dur":3,"text":"Most nervous speakers don't warm up their\nvoice."},"821":{"dur":3,"text":"They retreat inside themselves and start\nsaying all these bad things to themselves."},"825":{"dur":3,"text":"So, saying a tongue twister can help you\nbe both present-oriented and"},"828":{"dur":0,"text":"warm up your voice."},"830":{"dur":2,"text":"Remember, I said today we're gonna have a\nlot of participation?"},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm gonna ask you to repeat after me my\nfavorite tongue twister, and"},"837":{"dur":4,"text":"I like this tongue twister because if you\nsay it wrong you say a naughty word, and"},"841":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm gonna be listening to see if I hear\nany naughty words this morning."},"844":{"dur":0,"text":"Okay?"},"845":{"dur":0,"text":"Repeat after me."},"846":{"dur":1,"text":"It's only three phrases."},"847":{"dur":1,"text":"I slit a sheet."},"851":{"dur":1,"text":"A sheet I slit."},"854":{"dur":3,"text":"And on that slitted sheet I sit."},"861":{"dur":1,"text":"Very good, no shits."},"863":{"dur":0,"text":"Excellent."},"864":{"dur":0,"text":"Very good."},"866":{"dur":5,"text":"Now in that moment, in that moment, you\nweren't worried about,"},"871":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm in front of all these people, this is\nweird, this guy's having me do this."},"875":{"dur":2,"text":"You were so focused on saying it right and"},"877":{"dur":3,"text":"trying to figure out what the naughty word\nwas that you were in the present moment."},"881":{"dur":0,"text":"That's how easy it is."},"883":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's very possible for us to manage our\nanxiety."},"888":{"dur":4,"text":"We can do it initially by greeting the\nanxiety when we begin to feel those signs."},"892":{"dur":4,"text":"We can do it when we re-frame the\nsituation as a conversation."},"897":{"dur":3,"text":"And we do it when we become present\noriented."},"900":{"dur":3,"text":"Those are three of many tools that exist\nto help you manage your anxiety."},"905":{"dur":3,"text":"If you have questions about other ways,\nI'm happy to chat with you."},"909":{"dur":2,"text":"And at the end, I'm gonna point you to\nsome resources that you can"},"912":{"dur":2,"text":"refer to to help you find additional\nsources for you."},"917":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's get started on the core part of\nwhat we're doing today,"},"920":{"dur":4,"text":"which is how to feel more comfortable\nspeaking in spontaneous situations."},"925":{"dur":1,"text":"Some very simple ground rules for you."},"928":{"dur":4,"text":"First, I'm going to identify four steps\nthat I believe are critical to"},"932":{"dur":4,"text":"becoming effective at speaking in, in a\nspontaneous situation."},"936":{"dur":3,"text":"With each of those steps, I'm going to ask\nyou to participate in an activity."},"940":{"dur":3,"text":"None of them are more painful than saying\nthe tongue twister out loud."},"944":{"dur":2,"text":"They may require you to stand up, they\nmight require you to talk to"},"946":{"dur":3,"text":"the person next to you, but none of them\nare painful."},"949":{"dur":2,"text":"And then finally, I'm going to conclude\nwith a phrase or"},"952":{"dur":3,"text":"saying that comes from the wonderful world\nof improvisation."},"957":{"dur":2,"text":"Through the continuing studies program\nhere at Stanford, for"},"960":{"dur":3,"text":"the past five years, I have co-taught a\nclass with Adam Tobin."},"963":{"dur":4,"text":"He is a lecturer in the Creative Arts\nDepartment."},"968":{"dur":2,"text":"He teaches film and new media."},"970":{"dur":1,"text":"And he's an expert at improv."},"971":{"dur":2,"text":"And we've partnered together to help\npeople learn how to"},"974":{"dur":1,"text":"speak more spontaneously."},"976":{"dur":2,"text":"We call it improvisationally speaking."},"978":{"dur":2,"text":"And Adam has taught me wonderful phrases\nand"},"981":{"dur":3,"text":"ideas from improv that I want to impart to\nyou, that really stick."},"985":{"dur":3,"text":"That's why I'm sharing them with you, to\nhelp you remember these techniques."},"988":{"dur":3,"text":"And again at the end of all this, you'll\nget a handout that has this listed."},"991":{"dur":1,"text":"So let's get started."},"993":{"dur":6,"text":"The very first thing that gets in people's\nway when it comes to spontaneous speaking,"},"999":{"dur":1,"text":"is themselves."},"1001":{"dur":2,"text":"We get in our own way."},"1003":{"dur":1,"text":"We want to be perfect."},"1005":{"dur":2,"text":"We want to give the right answer."},"1008":{"dur":3,"text":"We want out toast to be incredibly\nmemorable."},"1011":{"dur":4,"text":"These things are burdened by our effort,\nby our trying."},"1016":{"dur":1,"text":"The best thing we can

for"},"1654":{"dur":3,"text":"the gift giver, because the gift giver\nthen has to say."},"1659":{"dur":2,"text":"So you look and you say thank you for\ngiving me a frog's leg,
