brands?"},"71":{"dur":2,"text":"CHRIS ANDERSON: Definitely\na long, twisting journey."},"74":{"dur":1,"text":"I was a journalist\noriginally, actually,"},"76":{"dur":1,"text":"when I first came\nout of university,"},"77":{"dur":4,"text":"and I made the mistake of buying\none of the early computers."},"82":{"dur":2,"text":"It was like a Tandy TRSAT clone."},"84":{"dur":2,"text":"And I was awed by this thing."},"86":{"dur":1,"text":"I kind of completely\nfell in love with it,"},"88":{"dur":2,"text":"and to cut a long story\nshort, a few years later,"},"91":{"dur":2,"text":"I found myself working at one\nof the early home computer"},"94":{"dur":1,"text":"magazines, and I loved that."},"96":{"dur":1,"text":"And then I decided,\nthis isn't so hard."},"97":{"dur":0,"text":"Let's publish one."},"98":{"dur":2,"text":"So I started a company,\npublished a magazine."},"101":{"dur":3,"text":"Bizarrely, it worked, and\nthen this thing took off."},"104":{"dur":1,"text":"And so the publishing\npart was just"},"106":{"dur":3,"text":"building lots and lots of these\nnichey hobbyist magazines that"},"109":{"dur":3,"text":"were deeply boring to everyone,\nexcept the people they"},"113":{"dur":2,"text":"were targeted at, who\nkind of loved them."},"115":{"dur":1,"text":"And so we had this philosophy."},"117":{"dur":2,"text":"Our complete logo was\nactually, \"Media with passion.\""},"120":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's always been my\nmantra as an entrepreneur"},"124":{"dur":1,"text":"is look for the passion."},"126":{"dur":2,"text":"If you can find something\nthat people are really"},"128":{"dur":1,"text":"passionate about,\nthat's your clue"},"130":{"dur":1,"text":"that there's something\nthere, that this is kind"},"131":{"dur":2,"text":"of the proxy for potential."},"134":{"dur":6,"text":"And so when I first came to\nTED in 1998, TED was back then,"},"140":{"dur":2,"text":"it was actually started in '84."},"142":{"dur":1,"text":"Nothing on the\ninternet, of course."},"144":{"dur":1,"text":"It was an annual conference."},"145":{"dur":0,"text":"That was it."},"146":{"dur":2,"text":"And I went there in '98."},"148":{"dur":2,"text":"It was bringing together\nTechnology, Entertainment,"},"150":{"dur":4,"text":"Design, TED, and I\nfell in love with it."},"155":{"dur":1,"text":"I thought, I've come home."},"156":{"dur":2,"text":"And what I saw was this passion."},"158":{"dur":1,"text":"People were so\npassionate about it."},"160":{"dur":2,"text":"It was like, this is my\nbest week of the year."},"162":{"dur":2,"text":"And I thought, why is this\nyour best week of the year?"},"165":{"dur":1,"text":"But that was the clue."},"167":{"dur":3,"text":"And so when there was a chance\nto buy TED from its founder--"},"170":{"dur":3,"text":"he was 65-- and I leapt at it."},"173":{"dur":3,"text":"And so that happened in 2001,\nand the journey since then"},"176":{"dur":1,"text":"has been a wild\njourney of its own."},"178":{"dur":0,"text":"But that's how I got there."},"179":{"dur":2,"text":"And we'll talk about\nthat journey since then."},"182":{"dur":2,"text":"In some sense, it's\nbeen said that it"},"184":{"dur":4,"text":"was the power of what was\nthen new media back in 2006,"},"188":{"dur":2,"text":"online video in particular,\nthat really gave TED its boost."},"191":{"dur":1,"text":"Would you say that's the case?"},"192":{"dur":2,"text":"CHRIS ANDERSON: That's\nabsolutely the case."},"195":{"dur":2,"text":"When I bought it, I bought\nit with a nonprofit,"},"198":{"dur":2,"text":"a foundation I had."},"200":{"dur":2,"text":"And so the intention\nwas always, it"},"202":{"dur":2,"text":"felt like there was\nall this inspiration."},"205":{"dur":2,"text":"It was supposed to be for\nthe public good somehow,"},"207":{"dur":2,"text":"but how could you\nlet out the knowledge"},"209":{"dur":2,"text":"that was at this private\nconference to the world?"},"211":{"dur":2,"text":"And our first attempt\nto do that was on TV,"},"214":{"dur":1,"text":"and TV wasn't interested."},"216":{"dur":1,"text":"These are lectures."},"217":{"dur":0,"text":"They're lectures."},"218":{"dur":0,"text":"They're kind of boring."},"219":{"dur":1,"text":"Lectures are boring."},"220":{"dur":1,"text":"Now I didn't actually\nlisten to them,"},"222":{"dur":1,"text":"because they weren't boring."},"223":{"dur":1,"text":"But they weren't interested."},"224":{"dur":1,"text":"And so yeah."},"225":{"dur":3,"text":"So when this weird technology\ncalled online video"},"228":{"dur":2,"text":"with its shaky little kittens\nand all these other things"},"231":{"dur":2,"text":"happening came along,\nwe thought, wait a sec."},"234":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe we could,\nas an experiment,"},"235":{"dur":1,"text":"put some TED Talks up."},"237":{"dur":1,"text":"Probably won't work."},"238":{"dur":2,"text":"They're too long\nfor the internet,"},"240":{"dur":2,"text":"and you're not going\nto be there live."},"242":{"dur":1,"text":"It's on video."},"243":{"dur":2,"text":"To our amazement, these\nthings went viral,"},"246":{"dur":1,"text":"and so that was\nthe moment, 2006,"},"247":{"dur":2,"text":"when we decided we had\nto flip TED on its head."},"249":{"dur":2,"text":"We're no longer\njust a conference."},"252":{"dur":4,"text":"We're a media organization\ndevoted to sharing ideas."},"256":{"dur":2,"text":"JIM LECINSKI: And so let's\nbuild on that a little bit."},"259":{"dur":3,"text":"You described what TED stands\nfor, T-E-D, but how would you"},"262":{"dur":3,"text":"talk about its\nmeaning, its purpose?"},"266":{"dur":2,"text":"What does the brand stand for?"},"268":{"dur":2,"text":"CHRIS ANDERSON: It stands\nfor the bringing together"},"270":{"dur":2,"text":"of knowledge in ways that\npeople can understand."},"273":{"dur":3,"text":"The world's really complicated,\nand most of the time,"},"277":{"dur":0,"text":"we go deep."},"278":{"dur":2,"text":"You have to know something well\nto have a chance of succeeding."},"280":{"dur":0,"text":"You dig deep."},"281":{"dur":1,"text":"You learn your speciality well."},"283":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's how most\nthings operate."},"284":{"dur":1,"text":"That's how most\nconferences operate,"},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"most university\ncourses, whatever."},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"That's what you have to do."},"290":{"dur":4,"text":"But there's a place for\ncontext to actually understand"},"294":{"dur":0,"text":"the world we're in."},"295":{"dur":1,"text":"You need to go\nbroader than that."},"297":{"dur":1,"text":"And actually, lots\nof other things"},"299":{"dur":3,"text":"happen when you bring together\nknowledge from different areas."},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"You get the catalyzing\nof new ideas."},"305":{"dur":2,"text":"You get the possibility\nof collaboration,"},"308":{"dur":2,"text":"and so I think that's\nwhat hit me suddenly"},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"was why Ted had a role to play."},"314":{"dur":1,"text":"There's just not\nmuch of that happens."},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"And so if you can persuade\npeople to come together"},"318":{"dur":2,"text":"from these different fields\nand explain something"},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"they're passionate about\nin ways that other people"},"322":{"dur":3,"text":"can actually understand,\nthat, I think, that definitely"},"326":{"dur":2,"text":"over a few days, for example,\nthat had the effect of selling"},"329":{"dur":1,"text":"these spots in your brain."},"330":{"dur":1,"text":"And you just thought\nof stuff that you"},"331":{"dur":1,"text":"hadn't thought of before."},"333":{"dur":1,"text":"And so that's what\nit stands for."},"335":{"dur":1,"text":"JIM LECINSKI: We'll\ncome back and chat"},"336":{"dur":2,"text":"a little bit in a\nsecond about the power"},"339":{"dur":2,"text":"of how those talks are built\non understandable ideas."},"342":{"dur":1,"text":"But I want to pursue--\nyou mentioned the word"},"344":{"dur":2,"text":"collaboration."},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"Most of our audiences\nhas not had the pleasure"},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"of actually attending the\nconference when they were"},"350":{"dur":1,"text":"in Long Beach or now\nback in Vancouver,"},"352":{"dur":2,"text":"so could you maybe paint a\nlittle picture about not just"},"355":{"dur":1,"text":"the speakers on\nthe stage that we"},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"can see by watching\nthe video, but it's"},"358":{"dur":3,"text":"a full four-day collaboration\nevent with the dinners."},"362":{"dur":1,"text":"And can you maybe\npaint picture of what"},"364":{"dur":1,"text":"happens during that week?"},"365":{"dur":0,"text":"CHRIS ANDERSON: Sure."},"366":{"dur":4,"text":"So yeah, it's four\nand 1\/2-ish days."},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"There are basically 12\nmain sessions of TED."},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"Each session is an\nhour and 45 minutes,"},"376":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's five to six speakers,\nplus other little performances"},"380":{"dur":1,"text":"and things thrown in there."},"382":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's quite fast-moving."},"383":{"dur":4,"text":"What's unusual about TED is that\neveryone sees every speaker."},"387":{"dur":1,"text":"It's one track."},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"And that doesn't usually happen,\nbut it is the whole point of it"},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"is you are supposed to be\nexposed to stuff you had"},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"no idea you were interested in."},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's become a truism at\nTED that the session that you"},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"think is going to be most boring\nis the one that blows you away."},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"And so amazingly,\npeople do commit"},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"to coming to each\nsession, and that"},"407":{"dur":3,"text":"means that you can have a shared\nconversation in the corridors"},"411":{"dur":1,"text":"after."},"412":{"dur":3,"text":"And the collaboration is not\nreally something we stage."},"416":{"dur":4,"text":"It just happens that the\ncombination of that exposure"},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"to these different\nspeakers and ideas,"},"422":{"dur":1,"text":"it sort of sparks\nthings in people,"},"424":{"dur":3,"text":"and weird projects\nemerge out of it."},"427":{"dur":0,"text":"JIM LECINSKI: Yeah."},"428":{"dur":4,"text":"Now is it the case-- I had heard\nthat you discourage or don't"},"432":{"dur":4,"text":"allow digital devices or\nlive tweeting or cameras"},"436":{"dur":1,"text":"or these kind of\nthings in the room?"},"438":{"dur":0,"text":"Is that the case?"},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"CHRIS ANDERSON:\nThat is the case."},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"Apart from the back\ntwo rows, where"},"442":{"dur":4,"text":"people can tweet if they want\nto, or in the simulcast spaces."},"446":{"dur":5,"text":"But in the main theater, we say\nno, because all of life right"},"452":{"dur":5,"text":"now is this attention war,\nand talks are weird things."},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"They often take\na while to build."},"460":{"dur":3,"text":"To share a really big idea or\nsomething that really matters,"},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"you sometimes have\nto build context."},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"You have to go through,\ngosh, 90 seconds, where"},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"it's a little bit challenging\nor boring for a minute."},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"If people-- because I've\njust got to check my email,"},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"just for this moment."},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"They miss a couple of key\ncontext things, they're gone."},"477":{"dur":1,"text":"And then the talk never lands."},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"And once more, the\nfive people behind them"},"481":{"dur":3,"text":"are sort of annoyed, and it's\nsending a signal that this"},"484":{"dur":0,"text":"isn't that interesting."},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"So everyone else decides\nit's not that interesting."},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"You are, right now, you\nare a super organism."},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"You're all actually,\nalthough you're not"},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"fully conscious of it, you're\nfeeding off each other."},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"You take cues from each other."},"496":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's what happens\nin a lot of things."},"498":{"dur":3,"text":"So we try to have a\ndifferent contract"},"501":{"dur":1,"text":"from the normal contract."},"502":{"dur":3,"text":"Audience, you're actually going\nto give your full attention"},"506":{"dur":1,"text":"to this speaker for 18 minutes."},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"Speaker, you're going to work\nbloody hard for several months"},"510":{"dur":3,"text":"to produce the talk of your life\nand make it worth their while."},"513":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's the deal."},"515":{"dur":1,"text":"asked that question as\njust a not-so-subtle hint"},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"to our audience today."},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"CHRIS ANDERSON: I'm\nactually stunned,"},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"because I thought coming\nto Google, of all places,"},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"you guys would all be\ncoding and whatever."},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"You're all so brilliant,\nyou can multitask your way"},"528":{"dur":0,"text":"No problem."},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"JIM LECINSKI: There you go."},"530":{"dur":3,"text":"So maybe tell us a little\nbit about the simple question"},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"of who gets to do a TED talk."},"535":{"dur":1,"text":"How do you decide?"},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"CHRIS ANDERSON: In\nprinciple, it's simple."},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"It's someone who's doing amazing\nwork that other people need"},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"to know about, and\nthe rest is detail."},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"And so it's hard to decide\nwho those people are."},"545":{"dur":4,"text":"We get 10,000 suggestions a year\nfrom people around the world."},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"We have a curation team."},"553":{"dur":1,"text":"For a conference,\nwe're trying to weave"},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"a sort of mix of people\ntogether around a theme."},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"This year's theme was dream\nas in big, bold dreams."},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"But there's no\nalgorithm to it yet."},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"Please don't invent\none just yet,"},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"or we'll be out of business."},"567":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a sort of-- because\nwe want, with the program,"},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"to-- and I think a lot of\nevents fail to do this."},"574":{"dur":3,"text":"We want to poke at\nevery different part"},"577":{"dur":1,"text":"of people's minds."},"578":{"dur":4,"text":"It can't just be about something\nanalytical or storytelling,"},"583":{"dur":3,"text":"There are different\nparts of minds"},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"engaged when you start\nto go to the aesthetic"},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"or to someone's inspiring\nstory, or to here's"},"591":{"dur":3,"text":"a really complex scientific\nissue that we're tackling in."},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"There's energy that\ncomes from that,"},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"and so it's not\njust who you bring."},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"It's then trying to sequence\nthem in a way that will work."},"604":{"dur":1,"text":"JIM LECINSKI: I\nheard you once say"},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"that-- I don't know if it's a\nfilter or a screen how you put"},"608":{"dur":1,"text":"it-- but one\nconsideration that you"},"610":{"dur":3,"text":"look at in deciding on\na speaker is who would"},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"benefit from hearing this idea."},"617":{"dur":1,"text":"Is it just your team?"},"619":{"dur":1,"text":"Is it just your organization?"},"620":{"dur":0,"text":"Or--"},"621":{"dur":1,"text":"So that is actually--\nI would say"},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"that is the number one\nadvice to a speaker,"},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's the core thing\nthat's in the book."},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"It's so tempting as a\nspeaker, you think, hey,"},"632":{"dur":1,"text":"I've got an opportunity."},"634":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'm going to use it."},"635":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm going to promote my\norganization, my cause,"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"and in the process, I'm\ngoing to take the chance"},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"to be a little bit of a\nrock star, because I can."},"644":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's the trap that\nso many people fall into,"},"648":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's very counterproductive,\nbecause it actually shuts down"},"651":{"dur":0,"text":"the audience."},"655":{"dur":1,"text":"If you can do it the\nother way around,"},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"if you can make\nclear from the start"},"658":{"dur":3,"text":"that your purpose in being on\nstage is to give something,"},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"is to give people a gift, a\ngift of something that you know,"},"665":{"dur":4,"text":"and that if they knew, it would\nmake a difference to them."},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean our lives are built\naround our worldviews."},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"Different knowledge\nmeans a different life."},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"It means doing things\ndifferently maybe years"},"677":{"dur":1,"text":"into the future."},"678":{"dur":3,"text":"So come with a gift,\nand I think if we"},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"don't see that in a speaker,\nif we smell for a minute"},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"that they're in it for\nself-promotional purposes"},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"primarily, not interested."},"688":{"dur":0,"text":"JIM LECINSKI: Right."},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's good advice not just\non stage at your conference,"},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"in general, I suppose."},"693":{"dur":0,"text":"CHRIS ANDERSON: I\nthink in general."},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"I think absolutely in general."},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"Even frankly, even if you\nare trying to sell something,"},"698":{"dur":3,"text":"the best salespeople don't\ncome on and say, hey,"},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"here's what I got."},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"They say, what are\nyou passionate about?"},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"What are you thinking about?"},"708":{"dur":1,"text":"What are you curious about?"},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"How can I help?"},"712":{"dur":0,"text":"So absolutely."},"713":{"dur":3,"text":"Every speaker should be\nthinking about the audience"},"717":{"dur":3,"text":"and what they can offer that\ncould be of interest and use."},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"JIM LECINSKI: Now in terms of\nspeaking delivery and speaking"},"723":{"dur":1,"text":"ability, you've\ndescribed yourself,"},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"and I think greatly\nunderselling your powers,"},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"as not a natural\ncharismatic speaker."},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"In some senses,\nyour predecessor was"},"733":{"dur":3,"text":"a charismatic, outgoing person."},"737":{"dur":1,"text":"But you've had this\nawesome ringside seat"},"739":{"dur":5,"text":"for the past dozen or so or more\nyears watching great speakers."},"744":{"dur":4,"text":"So what have you observed about\nthe perennial debate of you're"},"749":{"dur":4,"text":"a natural at it or not, or\nyou can learn it or not?"},"753":{"dur":3,"text":"Some people can only get so\nfar at being a good speaker."},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"What's your point on I\nguess nature and nurture?"},"759":{"dur":1,"text":"CHRIS ANDERSON: I\nmean, I'm convinced"},"760":{"dur":4,"text":"that the only thing that you\nneed to give a great talk"},"765":{"dur":1,"text":"is something worth saying."},"767":{"dur":1,"text":"You need knowledge."},"769":{"dur":5,"text":"You need to have done some work\nthat deserves a wider airing."},"777":{"dur":1,"text":"The rest can be taught."},"778":{"dur":3,"text":"Honestly, it can be taught,\nbecause the last thing you want"},"781":{"dur":3,"text":"is for everyone to learn some\nsort of style of speaking."},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"We don't want to think of\nspeaking as a performance."},"787":{"dur":1,"text":"There definitely\nare some people who"},"789":{"dur":3,"text":"are natural performers\nand who can in the moment"},"793":{"dur":4,"text":"sort of smoothly pluck\nbeautiful, elegant phrases out"},"798":{"dur":1,"text":"of nowhere and pass them on."},"799":{"dur":3,"text":"So not everyone\nprobably can do that."},"803":{"dur":1,"text":"But that's a good thing."},"804":{"dur":1,"text":"We don't want\neveryone to do that."},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"It would get\nexhausting, honestly."},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"What you want is a variety\nof different people,"},"811":{"dur":3,"text":"different skills, different\nstandpoints, different speaking"},"814":{"dur":1,"text":"styles."},"816":{"dur":1,"text":"What you want is authenticity."},"818":{"dur":1,"text":"You want people who\ncare about something."},"819":{"dur":2,"text":"And even if they half stammer\ntheir way through a talk,"},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"if you're learning\nsomething, that is fantastic."},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"So I just feel\npassionately about this"},"828":{"dur":2,"text":"that it's a tragedy that there\nare so many people out there"},"831":{"dur":1,"text":"in the world, and I\nbet there are even"},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"people here in this\nworld-leading company, who"},"836":{"dur":3,"text":"feel under-confident when\nit comes to public speaking,"},"840":{"dur":3,"text":"despite having something really\nvaluable to share, something"},"844":{"dur":3,"text":"that if the rest of the\nworld knew, rest of the world"},"847":{"dur":1,"text":"would like it."},"848":{"dur":1,"text":"And so we've got\nto get over that."},"849":{"dur":0,"text":"JIM LECINSKI: Yeah."},"850":{"dur":5,"text":"So maybe if you tell us a little\nbit about two people who've, I"},"856":{"dur":2,"text":"guess, fit both of those\nprofiles or archetypes"},"858":{"dur":1,"text":"that you just outlined."},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe Sir Ken Robinson\nas a natural, a gifted,"},"862":{"dur":1,"text":"one of those who can\npluck things out,"},"864":{"dur":2,"text":"and maybe someone who's a little\nmore hesitant like a

Sure."},"872":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean Sir Ken Robinson\ncame to TED in 2006."},"876":{"dur":2,"text":"I think he'd already\nbeen voted Europe's Best"},"879":{"dur":1,"text":"Speaker or something like
