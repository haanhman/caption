difference in my life"},"22":{"dur":3,"text":"and hopefully could make\na massive difference in your life too."},"26":{"dur":2,"text":"I've spent my life, really,\nstudying human beings."},"30":{"dur":2,"text":"When I was a kid,\nI was the youngest of four,"},"32":{"dur":2,"text":"so I spent a lot of time\njust watching my brothers and sisters"},"35":{"dur":2,"text":"and seeing the mess\nand the challenge that they got into,"},"38":{"dur":2,"text":"and trying to clock how I avoided that."},"40":{"dur":2,"text":"Then I had the great fortune\nof training as a physician,"},"43":{"dur":1,"text":"and some of you may know"},"45":{"dur":3,"text":"that medical training\nis the most incredible opportunity,"},"48":{"dur":3,"text":"because you get up close\nand personal with human suffering"},"52":{"dur":3,"text":"on every single level, on a daily basis."},"55":{"dur":3,"text":"I've been in a room where people\nhave died right in front of

from the audience) Hi, dad!"},"79":{"dur":2,"text":"So medical training,\na fantastic experience."},"83":{"dur":3,"text":"I became a researcher,\ninitially an immunologist,"},"86":{"dur":2,"text":"and

win gold medals."},"125":{"dur":2,"text":"I've read a lot, learned a lot."},"127":{"dur":4,"text":"And through all that time,\none question kept bothering me,"},"131":{"dur":2,"text":"sort of eating away at my brain."},"134":{"dur":1,"text":"And that question was:"},"135":{"dur":6,"text":"if you could teach yourself,\nyour children, or anybody one thing,"},"142":{"dur":1,"text":"what would it be?"},"143":{"dur":1,"text":"What would that one thing be?"},"145":{"dur":1,"text":"You can only teach one thing"},"147":{"dur":2,"text":"of all the things\nI've learned and

apple\";\nthat's not what it is."},"157":{"dur":1,"text":"We're going to talk about that."},"158":{"dur":4,"text":"But before, I want to return, just,\nto really the story of you."},"162":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't know whether you remember,"},"164":{"dur":4,"text":"but there was a time\nbefore you knew you existed."},"168":{"dur":3,"text":"For some of you that was probably\nlast Friday night, after a skinful."},"171":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"173":{"dur":2,"text":"But as we all grow up,\nthere's a moment in our life -"},"176":{"dur":2,"text":"and this is a really\nbeautiful moment if you witness it -"},"179":{"dur":2,"text":"where you can see, about one year old -"},"181":{"dur":3,"text":"it might happen a bit sooner, a bit later,\nbut roughly about one year old -"},"184":{"dur":3,"text":"where a child realizes they exist\nas a physical entity."},"188":{"dur":3,"text":"It's that moment where they look\nin the mirror, and they kind of go,"},"191":{"dur":1,"text":"\"Oh, that's me!\""},"193":{"dur":1,"text":"They move their hand\nand that hand moves,"},"195":{"dur":1,"text":"and they realize that that's them."},"197":{"dur":2,"text":"So they have a physical\nawareness, if you will."},"200":{"dur":3,"text":"But they haven't yet developed\nan awareness of their emotional self,"},"203":{"dur":2,"text":"which is why you get the terrible twos."},"205":{"dur":1,"text":"So when a two-year-old is hungry,"},"206":{"dur":3,"text":"the world is hungry\nand why aren't we eating?"},"210":{"dur":4,"text":"So there's that kind of intensity,\nthat egocentricity in a two-year-old."},"215":{"dur":2,"text":"That's where they kind of get\nto test the power."},"218":{"dur":1,"text":"So in the supermarket,"},"219":{"dur":3,"text":"it's \"Mom, mom, that that, me, me,\nfood, food, me, me, me, food,\""},"223":{"dur":2,"text":"and they kind of bother you\nto a great extent."},"225":{"dur":4,"text":"And then again, it's witnessable,\nthis moment where they suddenly realize"},"230":{"dur":2,"text":"that not only are they\nphysically separate from you,"},"232":{"dur":2,"text":"but their emotions\nare not your emotions."},"235":{"dur":1,"text":"You may have witnessed this"},"237":{"dur":3,"text":"with a child walking down\nthe aisle in the supermarket,"},"240":{"dur":4,"text":"eyes, streaming red,\nbawling in frustration and rage"},"245":{"dur":1,"text":"that they can't get what they want,"},"247":{"dur":2,"text":"and then looking at

chocolates.\""},"253":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"255":{"dur":1,"text":"There's that bafflement in their eyes,"},"257":{"dur":1,"text":"that sort of thousand yard stare."},"259":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's the emergence\nof the awareness of the emotional self,"},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"separate from the parent or the caregiver."},"265":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's a sort of second level up,"},"267":{"dur":2,"text":"but it's not until they get\nto three to six years old"},"269":{"dur":2,"text":"that they get into the \"conceptual self,\""},"272":{"dur":3,"text":"and part of that emergence\nis a sense of identity."},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's what you would know\nas consciousness,"},"277":{"dur":2,"text":"is they start to become aware -"},"279":{"dur":2,"text":"not only that they're physically,\nemotionally separate,"},"282":{"dur":1,"text":"but they've got an identity."},"283":{"dur":2,"text":"And it blossoms between\nthree and six years old."},"286":{"dur":1,"text":"One of the things that happens"},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"in the emergence\nof conceptual self is language."},"289":{"dur":4,"text":"So language is essentially a concept:\nit's a noise to represent something."},"293":{"dur":2,"text":"So the emergence\nof conceptual self happens,"},"296":{"dur":2,"text":"and we start to label our universe -"},"299":{"dur":3,"text":"you know, cat, dog, bat, ball,\nwindow, floor, and so on."},"302":{"dur":3,"text":"So the world starts to make sense\nand we start to be able to navigate."},"306":{"dur":2,"text":"Children between the age\nof three and six"},"308":{"dur":2,"text":"learn about six new words\nevery single day."},"310":{"dur":2,"text":"There's phenomenal\nlanguage acquisition going on."},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"But only from the fourth level,"},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"which is called concrete consciousness,"},"317":{"dur":3,"text":"they start to learn\nthe rules that govern the concepts."},"321":{"dur":1,"text":"Then it all starts to make sense:"},"323":{"dur":1,"text":"why is a dog a dog and a cat a cat?"},"325":{"dur":1,"text":"Why is a mummy a mummy\nand daddy a daddy?"},"327":{"dur":1,"text":"What's the rule?"},"328":{"dur":2,"text":"It's in that between\nsix and nine years old"},"331":{"dur":1,"text":"that the fun starts to happen."},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you speak to a seven-year-old,"},"334":{"dur":2,"text":"you can start to have fun\nby playing against the rules -"},"337":{"dur":2,"text":"you know, look at that cat\ngoing woof-woof?"},"339":{"dur":1,"text":"No!"},"341":{"dur":3,"text":"Cats go meow! They don't go woof-woof."},"345":{"dur":3,"text":"And it makes them laugh\nbecause you're playing against the rules."},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"There's this whole\nrule emergence that occurs"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"in a child between six and nine."},"353":{"dur":3,"text":"And then that's where most people"},"357":{"dur":1,"text":"stay ..."},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"(Laughter)"},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"Most of the people\nyou're going to meet, 20, 30, 40,"},"365":{"dur":1,"text":"on the inside: nine!"},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"369":{"dur":1,"text":"See it in accompanies all the time:"},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"toys out of the pram,\nbehaving like children."},"373":{"dur":1,"text":"It's very common."},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"There is an attempt,\nusually in the early teenage years,"},"377":{"dur":3,"text":"to get beyond that concrete self,\nto get beyond the rules,"},"380":{"dur":2,"text":"which is why you get teenage conflict."},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"You'll see it, and parents\ntry to suppress this,"},"386":{"dur":1,"text":"like it's a bad thing."},"387":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a developmental stage!"},"388":{"dur":3,"text":"You shouldn't be suppressing this stuff;\nthey're testing the rules."},"391":{"dur":1,"text":"So this battle ensues:"},"393":{"dur":3,"text":"you told me to be home at ten,\nI want to be home at 11."},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"You told me to be honest;\nyou're not being honest,"},"399":{"dur":1,"text":"and the fight breaks out."},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"And they have their whole\nturbulent teenage years."},"403":{"dur":4,"text":"Regardless of who wins that battle,\nwhether it's mom or dad or the child,"},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"it bubbles along for a few years."},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"Now eventually,\nregardless of who wins the battle,"},"412":{"dur":2,"text":"they leave home - hopefully."},"414":{"dur":3,"text":"(Laughter)"},"417":{"dur":3,"text":"(Applause)"},"422":{"dur":1,"text":"They go!

happens,"},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"usually, most commonly, in midlife."},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"Then you enter the stage\nwhat we call \"the disease of meaning,\""},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"is it starts to occur to you"},"512":{"dur":2,"text":"there's something wrong\nwith the picture of your life."},"514":{"dur":4,"text":"I've been following all these rules,\nand it hasn't delivered."},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"I thought if I was\na good corporate citizen,"},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"and I got a good job, and a good house,\nand paid tax and all of that

pain."},"532":{"dur":3,"text":"If that happens in a religious context,\npeople call it purgatory."},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, literally, it's hell on earth."},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"So people get into this state\nand often they lash out,"},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"they become unpleasant\nand negative and so on,"},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"because they're basically in pain."},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"Now there are two strategies to that pain."},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"First strategy - much loved by students -"},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"anaesthetic."},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"Because if I can blot\nout the meaning of life,"},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"that kind of existential question -"},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"if I'm wasted on a Friday night,"},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't have to think\nabout what's the meaning of all this."},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"It just goes away as a question."},"566":{"dur":4,"text":"So then some people do this every night,\nsome people every weekend, getting wasted,"},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"either through alcohol and drugs."},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"But the problem is\nwhen the hangover wears off,"},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"the question returns; it's still there."},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"You can't answer it."},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're smart, you realize\nanesthetics won't help you."},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"So you get into the second strategy,\nwhich is distraction."},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"There are lots of different\ntypes of distraction."},"589":{"dur":3,"text":"That distraction can simply be\nthat you become a gym bunny."},"593":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's pump some iron."},"595":{"dur":4,"text":"Because when I'm feeling the burn,\nI don't have to think about the question."},"599":{"dur":4,"text":"So I become \"the body beautiful,\"\nstuck at the gym the whole time,"},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"getting the kick\non the endorphins and so on."},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"But you realize that, actually,\nwhen you get away from the gym,"},"610":{"dur":1,"text":"the question is there again."},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"So the gym doesn't solve it."},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"So you might use\na very common strategy:"},"616":{"dur":1,"text":"sex ..."},"617":{"dur":1,"text":"Right?"},"618":{"dur":3,"text":"Because while I am engaged\nin the intimacy of the sexual union,"},"621":{"dur":3,"text":"I don't have to think about the question,\nbecause I'm too busy doing this."},"625":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"628":{"dur":3,"text":"But you may have noticed\nthat when the act is over,"},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"that bloody question comes back again."},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"So some people go even more nuts:\nI'll have sex with two people,"},"638":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"then a whole crowd -"},"641":{"dur":3,"text":"desperately trying to get away\nfrom this question that's bothering them:"},"646":{"dur":1,"text":"the meaning of their life."},"648":{"dur":3,"text":"So if sex doesn't work -\nand it doesn't, ultimately -"},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"then you get into materialism: shoes!"},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll go and buy some shoes."},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"Or a car, or a house, or a yacht."},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"So we get into materialism,"},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"or some people that we see,\nvery common in industry, workaholism -"},"663":{"dur":1,"text":"they become work-addicted."},"664":{"dur":2,"text":"Because while I am working\nthat hard, having to do stuff,"},"667":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't have to think about the question."},"669":{"dur":1,"text":"None of that solves the problem."},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"Because we mistakenly believe"},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"that the problem is out there\nand the solution is out there,"},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"whereas the real problem is in here."},"679":{"dur":4,"text":"You cannot solve your sense\nof emptiness, or your unrest,"},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"with an external solution\noutside of yourself."},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"So stop looking out there,\nyou have to look in here,"},"689":{"dur":3,"text":"and particularly to look\nat your own emotional experience."},"693":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, most people go through their life\ncompletely unaware of emotions,"},"697":{"dur":1,"text":"particularly us fellows, right?"},"698":{"dur":3,"text":"If somebody mentions the word \"emotions,\"\nwe run for the hills!"},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"Emotions are just energy in motion,\nthey're composite biological signals:"},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"the signals made up\nof all the pounding heart rate,"},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"the sweaty palms,\nthe tension in the muscles"},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"or whatever is going on biologically,"},"713":{"dur":4,"text":"it's stereotypical energetic patterns -\nenergy in motion, they are e-motions."},"718":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, we all have emotions,\nevery single second of every single day,"},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"even us fellows."},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"Feelings, however,\nare something entirely different."},"725":{"dur":3,"text":"Feelings are the awareness\nin our mind of the energy."},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"So the energy is always there\nbut we don't necessarily feel it,"},"731":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's where we're stuck -"},"734":{"dur":4,"text":"is we haven't really learned\nto understand our own emotional life."},"738":{"dur":1,"text":"So we go through our life"},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"believing how we're feeling\non a moment by moment basis"},"742":{"dur":1,"text":"is down to somebody else."},"743":{"dur":1,"text":"We actually say this:"},"745":{"dur":3,"text":"\"You annoyed me,\"\n\"You made me unhappy,\""},"748":{"dur":3,"text":"\"You did it to me,\"\nand we point the finger at other people,"},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"believing other people are\nthe cause of our own unhappiness."},"755":{"dur":1,"text":"So newsflash:"},"757":{"dur":1,"text":"nobody's doing it to you."},"759":{"dur":1,"text":"Nobody's making you feel these things."},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, what do you think that happens"},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"when you get frustrated\nwith somebody else?"},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"Did they come up to you\nand inject you with frustration,"},"768":{"dur":1,"text":"with the chemicals of frustration?"},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"Did they create the electrical\nsignals of frustration,"},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"the pressure waves, the sound waves?"},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"No. You did that."},"778":{"dur":4,"text":"You created that inside yourself\nin response to their poor behavior."},"783":{"dur":3,"text":"So, if you can accept\nthat you're doing it -"},"788":{"dur":1,"text":"it's not them, it's you -"},"790":{"dur":3,"text":"that simple truth takes you\nfrom what we call the victim position,"},"795":{"dur":3,"text":"and it crosses the threshold to ownership."},"799":{"dur":3,"text":"That's the most important transition\nyou'll ever make in your life."},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"So to help you navigate that,"},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"first and foremost, you have to understand\nwhere am I in the universe of emotions."},"808":{"dur":3,"text":"If I asked you to write down your current\nemotions and gave you five minutes,"},"812":{"dur":1,"text":"you'd have a list of things,"},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"and then we said, OK,\nput your hands up who's got how many,"},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"and we did a test of how many you got,"},"819":{"dur":3,"text":"the average in a room like this\nwould be about ten or twelve."},"822":{"dur":4,"text":"There are 34,000 emotions\nthat you can experience."},"827":{"dur":2,"text":"Most people go through life\nwith ten or twelve."},"829":{"dur":3,"text":"And just to try to help you navigate,\nI'll show you an app that we've built"},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"to help people know where they are\nin the universe of emotions."},"836":{"dur":4,"text":"So we've plotted\nall these emotions on a map,"},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"and this map shows you the axes."},"843":{"dur":5,"text":"So, to the top of the axis\nin the universe of emotions,"},"848":{"dur":3,"text":"we've got the ones that are,\nsort of, more energy, if you like,"},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"and to the bottom the ones\nthat are more relaxed."},"854":{"dur":2,"text":"To the left the ones\nthat are more positive"},"856":{"dur":2,"text":"and to the right the ones\nthat are more negative."},"859":{"dur":3,"text":"So you can see that we've plotted\nmaybe the 20 commonest emotions there,"},"862":{"dur":3,"text":"and as I'm talking to you, right now,\nyou're somewhere on this grid."},"866":{"dur":3,"text":"You're somewhere in the universe\nexperiencing one of these planets,"},"870":{"dur":3,"text":"and we can bring in the next 100 emotions,"},"873":{"dur":3,"text":"we can bring in the next\n200 emotions, the next 1,000."},"877":{"dur":3,"text":"So we've built this app to try\nand crowd source with you all 34,000,"},"880":{"dur":3,"text":"we've built it with\njust 2,000 as a starter."},"883":{"dur":5,"text":"And you can enter into\none of the 64 galaxies that exist"},"889":{"dur":2,"text":"and start to navigate round"},"891":{"dur":3,"text":"and see where you are in relation\nto some of the other emotions,"},"895":{"dur":3,"text":"because if you don't know\nwhere you are, you're lost."},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, you'd never get control\nof your own state,"},"902":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's really important for your health,\nfor your well-being, for your success,"},"905":{"dur":1,"text":"whatever you're doing,"},"906":{"dur":2,"text":"whether you're a sportsperson\nor a business leader,"},"909":{"dur":2,"text":"that you can start to

any of this stuff?"},"917":{"dur":1,"text":"The answer is you can't."},"919":{"dur":4,"text":"So the start of the journey\nis even knowing which planet are you on."},"924":{"dur":3,"text":"This is
