all that shocked."},"392":{"dur":4,"text":"But it wasn't within their-- the\nrealm of possibility for them,"},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"because they figured if\nyou raised your child

a\nProtestant evangelical home,"},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"sola scriptura is\nkind of the mantra--"},"464":{"dur":0,"text":"JACK MCCLURE: Mhm."},"465":{"dur":2,"text":"And say what that

sense that,\nspecifically, as"},"478":{"dur":3,"text":"in opposition to\nthe Catholic Church,"},"481":{"dur":3,"text":"and the idea that you\nfigure out what's true about"},"484":{"dur":1,"text":"scripture through\nthe magisterium."},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"Which I got through\nthe magisterium,"},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"instead, know-- just going\nback to the

thousands of denominations."},"496":{"dur":1,"text":"But it also--"},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"JACK MCCLURE: And relative to\nthat, that's important to us"},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"here, from a

the magisterium, is\nthe way we would say that."},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"And the Protestant\ntradition would"},"517":{"dur":3,"text":"say, in scripture alone-- sola\nscriptura, as you called it."},"520":{"dur":0,"text":"MATTHEW VINES: Right."},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"JACK MCCLURE: In\nscripture alone,"},"523":{"dur":3,"text":"and so actually, it\nseems to me that we're"},"526":{"dur":3,"text":"kind of moving toward a better\nunderstanding, in the Roman"},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"Catholic side, of scripture."},"531":{"dur":3,"text":"Because we had not studied it\nas people, as the people of God."},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"Our priests had and theologians."},"537":{"dur":1,"text":"But you got into some\nof that study, which"},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"I think has

that--"},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"And part of the reason why that\nstudy is possible, or possible"},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"to be more effective\nwithin my context,"},"552":{"dur":4,"text":"is because, theoretically,\nat least, with Protestants,"},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"all you have to do\nis convince someone"},"559":{"dur":1,"text":"of a different\ninterpretation of the text."},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"MATTHEW VINES: And\nthat is all, in theory,"},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"that is required in order to\nchange beliefs and then

not formal\ninstitutional hurdles"},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"that's anywhere like what you\nhave in the Catholic church."},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"So what I end up doing\nwas finding every

about it?"},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"That's not sufficient."},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"But there's a lot of\nimportant things there."},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"But I also found a lot of\nmore popular level literature"},"618":{"dur":3,"text":"that was easy to read but do not\nspeak to people like my parents"},"622":{"dur":1,"text":"in a way that was\ngoing to be helpful."},"623":{"dur":1,"text":"Because it would\nstart off, and it"},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"would express presuppositions\nabout the Bible"},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"from the very\nbeginning, that would"},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"be offensive to, say, my dad."},"631":{"dur":1,"text":"If you start off\nand you say, well,"},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"the Bible says a\nlot of wacky things"},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"and we just need to take it\na

two"},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"pages of your book."},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"Because the way\nthat this debate has"},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"been cast for a lot of\nconservative Christians,"},"648":{"dur":3,"text":"and part of the reason why\nLGBT issues remain so fraught"},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"in a lot of the country--\nespecially Middle America"},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"and the South-- is\nbecause many Christians"},"657":{"dur":4,"text":"have come to believe that if\nthey change what they think"},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"about same sex

indicates, change"},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"your mind on same-sex\nrelationships"},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"by taking by Bible\nless seriously,"},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"that's just not going to fly."},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"Because you're going to\nthe very heart of what"},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"is most important to\nsomeone's worldview"},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"and asking them to set it aside."},"698":{"dur":3,"text":"Some people may be willing\nto do that-- not most people."},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"And if that is all that\nLGBT kids growing up"},"705":{"dur":3,"text":"in conservative Christian\nhomes have at their disposal,"},"708":{"dur":3,"text":"when they're coming out, that's\nnot nearly sufficient for them."},"712":{"dur":1,"text":"And so, part of\nwhat I wanted to do"},"713":{"dur":4,"text":"was to take a lot of-- to\nsynthesize a lot of the best"},"718":{"dur":2,"text":"insights of academics\nand biblical scholars,"},"721":{"dur":4,"text":"but then

with."},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"So sometimes that\nrequires revisions."},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"There might be somebody-- you\ncan have some of the-- I mean,"},"738":{"dur":1,"text":"there are scholars

sexuality."},"769":{"dur":4,"text":"However, you can only rely\non that kind of work so far."},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"And then you have to put\nit within your own context"},"776":{"dur":3,"text":"and make sure that you're\ngrounding it within principles"},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"around scripture that\nare consistent with those"},"782":{"dur":1,"text":"of your community."},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"So that was really what I\nset out to do with my dad,"},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"initially just, like, over\ndinner table conversations when"},"788":{"dur":1,"text":"I was home."},"789":{"dur":3,"text":"Then, it turned into engaging\nour church much more widely."},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"Then, it led me to,\ntwo years later,"},"796":{"dur":3,"text":"give an hour-long
