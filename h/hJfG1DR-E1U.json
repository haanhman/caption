at a time when the proliferation"},"1048":{"dur":4,"text":"of nuclear weapons and nuclear\nmaterials is a growing global danger."},"1053":{"dur":4,"text":"So that's the first existential\nreason that

countries,"},"1066":{"dur":5,"text":"bordering regions like Asia, Europe, and the\nMiddle East whose futures are vitally connected"},"1072":{"dur":2,"text":"with the interest of the United
