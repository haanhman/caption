whether\nSelectUSA is successful or not."},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"It's tricky because our\neconomic development"},"766":{"dur":3,"text":"partners want to count the\ndeals as their deals so we"},"770":{"dur":2,"text":"don't want to end up in\na position where there's"},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"some kind of competition\nthere because the goal is"},"776":{"dur":1,"text":"really to

successful."},"785":{"dur":4,"text":"And frankly those of us\nwho are affiliated with"},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"the activities to\nmonitor what's going on."},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's an area

policies, that\ncan attract foreign investment."},"6696":{"dur":3,"text":"That was one overarching\ntheme that she spoke about."},"6699":{"dur":3,"text":"And she -- secondly, she\nsaid that they would --"},"6703":{"dur":2,"text":"this commerce department\nwould very much like some"},"6705":{"dur":2,"text":"advice on how to\nposition the U.S."},"6708":{"dur":1,"text":"as a good place to

on."},"6747":{"dur":2,"text":"Secondly, she spoke about\nworkforce development, and"},"6749":{"dur":2,"text":"many of you echo those\nsame comments, the need"},"6752":{"dur":2,"text":"for help in that area."},"6754":{"dur":4,"text":"Thirdly, encouraging small\nand mid-sized enterprises,"},"6759":{"dur":2,"text":"that that's really an area\nwhere we could see --"},"6761":{"dur":3,"text":"where some advice\nwould be very welcome."},"6765":{"dur":3,"text":"She also spoke about\nhow to create a foreign"},"6768":{"dur":2,"text":"development\ninvestment ecosystem."},"6771":{"dur":2,"text":"How do we

development,\nwhich is true whether"},"6793":{"dur":2,"text":"you're dealing with\nforeign investment or domestic"},"6795":{"dur":1,"text":"investment as well."},"6796":{"dur":3,"text":"So, there's a

out"},"6839":{"dur":3,"text":"there, I do think this\nquestion of sustainability"},"6842":{"dur":3,"text":"of Select USA by itself\nis a short term -- a very"},"6846":{"dur":3,"text":"short term area that we\ncould be of assistance,"},"6849":{"dur":0,"text":"almost immediately."},"6850":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, as I suggested\nbefore, I ask that we get"},"6853":{"dur":4,"text":"everyone's

then, we do plan to\ncreate some working groups"},"6892":{"dur":2,"text":"that will be focused, I\nthink, on some of these"},"6894":{"dur":4,"text":"five areas that have been\nsuggested, and any others"},"6898":{"dur":3,"text":"that we feel a compunction\nto go forward with."},"6901":{"dur":2,"text":"And what I think what I\nmight do -- and Leigh and"},"6903":{"dur":2,"text":"Caroline will of

group."},"6931":{"dur":3,"text":"They may just be things we\ncan raise up as issues."},"6934":{"dur":2,"text":"But I think one of the\nthings we're driving"},"6936":{"dur":3,"text":"towards in this
