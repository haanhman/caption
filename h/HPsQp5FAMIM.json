those"},"463":{"dur":3,"text":"interest groups don't like, so they would have rebelled."},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"So in order to take that off the table,"},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"they did a lot less of that than was initially proposed."},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"So we ended up with a bill that covered everybody."},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"To its credit."},"476":{"dur":1,"text":"So what does that mean?"},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"What that means, five years later now,"},"480":{"dur":4,"text":"is that consumers have adapted, which I'm gonna talk about,"},"484":{"dur":3,"text":"and providers have adapted, but the private sector,"},"487":{"dur":3,"text":"the private market, has worked together"},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"in a way that wasn't happening as much before."},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"There were some leaders in the healthcare industry,"},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"but now, working together, you're starting to see"},"499":{"dur":3,"text":"the providers and the insurers work together"},"503":{"dur":3,"text":"instead of sitting across the negotiating table,"},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"arguing over who's gonna pay for what,"},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"which had always been the case,"},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"now you're seeing them do a couple of things."},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"One is get into each other's business,"},"515":{"dur":2,"text":"which I think, as you see the healthcare system evolve"},"518":{"dur":2,"text":"in the private market, you're gonna see a lot more of that,"},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"a lot more co-mingling of the insurance side"},"524":{"dur":3,"text":"and the provider side, seeing private entities"},"528":{"dur":3,"text":"like Walmart and even Google, Microsoft,"},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"get into healthcare in some way."},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'm gonna talk about some of the technological advances"},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"that will lead to that, but you're gonna see"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"a lot more of the coming together,"},"541":{"dur":4,"text":"because that's the way the private market has been driven."},"545":{"dur":3,"text":"So the quality, the baton of quality and cost"},"549":{"dur":1,"text":"has been picked up by the private market,"},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"and now they're running down the track."},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"So you're seeing it a lot here in California."},"555":{"dur":2,"text":"In Florida, where I'm from, and Florida Blue,"},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"where I work, we're very much involved in leading the way"},"561":{"dur":2,"text":"on this

been"},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"talking about in your health policy classes."},"572":{"dur":3,"text":"Those are real-world examples of things that are happening"},"576":{"dur":3,"text":"to have a transformation in our delivery system."},"579":{"dur":3,"text":"So when we contract with a hospital through an accountable"},"583":{"dur":3,"text":"care organization, and we have 18 of them in Florida,"},"586":{"dur":3,"text":"or we contract with a patient-centered medical"},"589":{"dur":2,"text":"home network, and we have 2,700 physicians"},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"that are involved in our patient-centered medical homes,"},"595":{"dur":4,"text":"that's about 750,000 lives that are covered in that."},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"We do it based upon quality and cost."},"605":{"dur":1,"text":"And we do predictive modeling."},"606":{"dur":2,"text":"We work with the provider to try to determine"},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"what the cost that's appropriate for covering"},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"the population that they serve."},"614":{"dur":3,"text":"We agree upon a target, and at the end of the year,"},"618":{"dur":3,"text":"if you've reduced the cost beyond what was expected,"},"621":{"dur":3,"text":"that's great, good job, but it's not enough."},"626":{"dur":3,"text":"You have to have also increased the quality,"},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"or at least make sure the quality doesn't regress."},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"Keeping it the same or improving it,"},"634":{"dur":3,"text":"across a couple of dozen metrics that are used."},"637":{"dur":1,"text":"And again, this happens all across the country"},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's happening here in California, as well."},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"So when you have that type of system,"},"644":{"dur":3,"text":"miraculously, it incentivizes collaboration."},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"And for the first time, as I said,"},"651":{"dur":1,"text":"providers and physicians and hospitals"},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"are aligned on their incentive."},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"And what's most exciting is:"},"657":{"dur":1,"text":"who's the biggest winner in that?"},"659":{"dur":2,"text":"The biggest winner is the consumer."},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"Because you're getting higher quality healthcare"},"664":{"dur":4,"text":"at a lower cost, so it's driving competition in the market."},"669":{"dur":1,"text":"It's driving innovation."},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"And what you're starting to see, again,"},"673":{"dur":3,"text":"led in the private sector, is that that innovation"},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"that's moving forward is transforming"},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"the healthcare system in ways that were inconceivable"},"682":{"dur":3,"text":"and seemed like science fiction only a few years ago."},"685":{"dur":3,"text":"So you have payment reform that's driving the cost"},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"part of that, but you have innovation"},"692":{"dur":3,"text":"and you have quality and you have all of these things"},"696":{"dur":4,"text":"coming together in a way that increases competition"},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"and it empowers the consumer."},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"So those are the three things now,"},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"that we see moving forward."},"707":{"dur":4,"text":"Consumer empowerment, competition, and innovation."},"712":{"dur":2,"text":"And what you're starting to see with competition is we"},"714":{"dur":3,"text":"need to compete based upon cost, not based upon"},"718":{"dur":3,"text":"how many bells and whistles you have."},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"How many things you have at the hospital."},"723":{"dur":1,"text":"And competition in the healthcare market"},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"used to be, if one hospital had a helicopter,"},"728":{"dur":3,"text":"the hospital across the street had to have two helicopters."},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"Which means the third hospital had to have three."},"734":{"dur":3,"text":"That type of competition does not drive cost reduction."},"738":{"dur":1,"text":"It's the opposite of that."},"740":{"dur":4,"text":"So competition not done well in the healthcare industry,"},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"in the healthcare market, doesn't work so well."},"746":{"dur":3,"text":"So what you're seeing now is the proper kind of competition"},"749":{"dur":3,"text":"and it leads to consumer empowerment."},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"So, transparency and control is something"},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"that is gonna be universal across the healthcare system."},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"Instead of the healthcare system being designed"},"761":{"dur":3,"text":"around the provider, the convenience of the physician"},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"and the hospital, it's gonna be the exact opposite now."},"768":{"dur":2,"text":"It's gonna be designed around the convenience"},"770":{"dur":3,"text":"of the consumer, of the healthcare beneficiary."},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"So when you see things like kiosks,"},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"self-service kiosks, we have one in one"},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"of our retail centers in South Florida,"},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"where you can go into the kiosk and sit there"},"785":{"dur":4,"text":"and be connected to the Children's Hospital of Miami."},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"So you don't have to drive through traffic"},"791":{"dur":1,"text":"to see that physician, and you don't have to wait"},"793":{"dur":2,"text":"in that waiting room; you go to the kiosk"},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"and you sign in and there's a doctor in front of you."},"798":{"dur":3,"text":"And you, you're sitting at the mall, right?"},"801":{"dur":1,"text":"That's a big difference."},"803":{"dur":3,"text":"But what that's gonna evolve into is control"},"806":{"dur":3,"text":"to the point where you're gonna have, on your phone,"},"810":{"dur":3,"text":"the ability to connect with any physician that you want."},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's gonna be, instead of saying, well:"},"815":{"dur":1,"text":"the doctor will see you now."},"817":{"dur":1,"text":"It's gonna be telling the doctor:"},"819":{"dur":2,"text":"the patient will see you now."},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you don't wanna play in that world,"},"823":{"dur":2,"text":"and you're not comfortable with that technology,"},"825":{"dur":3,"text":"you're not gonna do very well, as a healthcare provider."},"828":{"dur":2,"text":"So you'll be able to connect on the iPhone"},"831":{"dur":2,"text":"directly to an available physician."},"834":{"dur":3,"text":"You'll be able to have devices that monitor your vitals,"},"837":{"dur":2,"text":"and your temperature and all the things"},"840":{"dur":1,"text":"that people look for."},"841":{"dur":2,"text":"If you have diabetes, you can check your blood sugar."},"843":{"dur":3,"text":"All of the things, and that's just the first step."},"846":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's gonna be much more about giving the consumer"},"850":{"dur":2,"text":"the ability to control their own destiny,"},"852":{"dur":4,"text":"to control their access, and to control their own health."},"856":{"dur":2,"text":"Because prevention is the key to the whole thing."},"858":{"dur":3,"text":"Preventing people from getting sick in the first place."},"862":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, what you have to avoid and be careful of,"},"865":{"dur":2,"text":"I told you about the wrong type of competition,"},"868":{"dur":3,"text":"there's also the wrong type of consumer empowerment."},"871":{"dur":4,"text":"So, when you see this direct-to-consumer marketing,"},"875":{"dur":3,"text":"commercials on TV where they encourage the consumer"},"878":{"dur":1,"text":"to go to the doctor and tell them what type"},"880":{"dur":2,"text":"of prescription drug they want,"},"883":{"dur":3,"text":"or you're driving down the highway and you see"},"886":{"dur":2,"text":"this sign that says: we're an emergency room"},"888":{"dur":1,"text":"and we'll see you in five minutes."},"890":{"dur":1,"text":"Our wait is five minutes."},"891":{"dur":3,"text":"What they don't tell you is it's gonna cost three times more"},"894":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's one of the least-efficient settings"},"896":{"dur":1,"text":"where you can get your healthcare."},"898":{"dur":2,"text":"You'd be better off going somewhere else."},"900":{"dur":3,"text":"But if the consumer is not well-educated,"},"904":{"dur":2,"text":"then if they make bad decisions, that doesn't help anyone."},"906":{"dur":1,"text":"It doesn't help them and it doesn't help"},"908":{"dur":3,"text":"the cost and quality aspects that we're talking about."},"911":{"dur":3,"text":"We wanna help consumers make good choices."},"915":{"dur":4,"text":"And competition sometimes can drive costs the wrong way,"},"920":{"dur":2,"text":"but I want you to consider an example in what it means"},"922":{"dur":2,"text":"for the insurance industry of how it works the right way."},"925":{"dur":3,"text":"Right now, you don't have transparency."},"928":{"dur":2,"text":"And when you talk about empowering the consumer,"},"930":{"dur":1,"text":"we're talking about giving them the ability"},"932":{"dur":3,"text":"to cross reference pricing and outcomes"},"935":{"dur":1,"text":"and know when they go to a provider"},"937":{"dur":2,"text":"whether or not they're giving good quality."},"940":{"dur":2,"text":"So those measurements and those metrics"},"942":{"dur":2,"text":"that I talked about earlier, making sure"},"944":{"dur":2,"text":"that providers are doing the appropriate things"},"947":{"dur":3,"text":"and being reimbursed based upon not the quantity"},"951":{"dur":3,"text":"of care, but the quality of care that they are offering."},"954":{"dur":2,"text":"Moving away from a fee-for-service system,"},"957":{"dur":1,"text":"where every time you show up at the doctor,"},"959":{"dur":2,"text":"every test they run, every procedure they order,"},"961":{"dur":3,"text":"they make more money, into a system where,"},"964":{"dur":3,"text":"instead, we're reimbursing based upon keeping you healthy"},"968":{"dur":2,"text":"and keeping you well and out of the system."},"971":{"dur":2,"text":"That's what it's supposed to be about."},"973":{"dur":2,"text":"But you can't operate in that system,"},"976":{"dur":1,"text":"to the benefit of the consumer,"},"977":{"dur":2,"text":"completely, until the consumer has transparency,"},"980":{"dur":2,"text":"until you're able to comparison shop."},"983":{"dur":1,"text":"And you know, when you need a knee surgery"},"984":{"dur":2,"text":"and you have six hospitals that can do it,"},"987":{"dur":1,"text":"which one has the best outcomes"},"989":{"dur":1,"text":"and which one has the lowest

the problem,"},"2036":{"dur":1,"text":"were it not for the disfunction"},"2038":{"dur":1,"text":"that's occurring in Congress."},"2039":{"dur":3,"text":"But just looking at the way the process is supposed to work,"},"2042":{"dur":2,"text":"they could easily fix the problem."},"2045":{"dur":2,"text":"But then the states, those 34 states,"},"2047":{"dur":3,"text":"most of them with Republican legislatures and governors,"},"2051":{"dur":3,"text":"are gonna probably, at first, be pleased with the result,"},"2055":{"dur":2,"text":"but then they are gonna realize that they now have,"},"2057":{"dur":3,"text":"in Florida's case, 1.2 million people,"},"2061":{"dur":2,"text":"and in other states, you know, millions across"},"2063":{"dur":2,"text":"the other states in America, people who,"},"2065":{"dur":2,"text":"all of a sudden, have no health insurance."},"2068":{"dur":4,"text":"Because the average premium in the exchange in Florida,"},"2073":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'm sure it's similar in other states,"},"2075":{"dur":3,"text":"is almost $400 for people who bought through the exchange."},"2079":{"dur":4,"text":"The out of pocket costs for the individual is $90,"},"2085":{"dur":3,"text":"approximately; the rest is covered by the subsidy."},"2088":{"dur":3,"text":"So, if you're gonna increase the out of pocket cost"},"2092":{"dur":3,"text":"from $90 to $400, it's unaffordable for people."},"2096":{"dur":2,"text":"They are simply not gonna be able to afford it."},"2099":{"dur":2,"text":"So, what are they gonna do?"},"2102":{"dur":1,"text":"They're not gonna disappear."},"2104":{"dur":1,"text":"They're not gonna throw their hands up and say:"},"2106":{"dur":1,"text":"okay, I'll just go home now."},"2107":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't have health insurance anymore."},"2108":{"dur":1,"text":"And I had it for two years."},"2110":{"dur":2,"text":"They're gonna march on their state capital,"},"2112":{"dur":1,"text":"and their gonna go to Washington"},"2114":{"dur":2,"text":"and they're gonna say: why did you do this to me?"},"2116":{"dur":2,"text":"Why do my cousins in California"},"2118":{"dur":2,"text":"have health insurance through the exchange"},"2121":{"dur":3,"text":"and I don't, because of a political decision?"},"2125":{"dur":1,"text":"Under the same law?"},"2127":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not supposed to work that way."},"2129":{"dur":2,"text":"And unlike the Medicaid population,"},"2132":{"dur":2,"text":"because if you're really cynical,"},"2134":{"dur":3,"text":"the Medicaid population, some could look at"},"2137":{"dur":4,"text":"and say: I kinda know how that population's gonna vote."},"2142":{"dur":2,"text":"And I may or may not be worried"},"2144":{"dur":2,"text":"about that vote going against me."},"2147":{"dur":3,"text":"You can't do that with the exchange population."},"2150":{"dur":3,"text":"The exchange population is diverse, politically"},"2154":{"dur":3,"text":"and in other ways, so when you look at that population,"},"2157":{"dur":2,"text":"you can't make a political calculation and say:"},"2160":{"dur":3,"text":"oh, I don't need that group of people to win my election."},"2163":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'm not gonna worry about that issue."},"2165":{"dur":1,"text":"You can't do that."},"2167":{"dur":2,"text":"And you're gonna see those folks in church"},"2170":{"dur":2,"text":"and in the grocery store, and in your office,"},"2172":{"dur":2,"text":"and you're gonna wonder why you're in the predicament"},"2175":{"dur":3,"text":"that you're in, so that's gonna be a real, ah,"},"2180":{"dur":3,"text":"public policy issue that's gonna need to be dealt with."},"2184":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I would leave you with that, thinking about it."},"2186":{"dur":2,"text":"And I don't believe it's gonna be overturned."},"2189":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that the court will rule in favor"},"2191":{"dur":2,"text":"of the Burwell side, but if it's not,"},"2193":{"dur":4,"text":"we go into open enrollment for the exchange this fall."},"2198":{"dur":2,"text":"And there is no state, almost no state,"},"2201":{"dur":2,"text":"that can move quickly enough in a June decision"},"2203":{"dur":2,"text":"to implement a state exchange in time"},"2206":{"dur":1,"text":"for open enrollment in the fall."},"2207":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's no insurance company in the country"},"2210":{"dur":3,"text":"that can change and modify, accurately,"},"2214":{"dur":2,"text":"their decisions, based upon that decision."},"2216":{"dur":3,"text":"So we're doing contingency planning like everybody else is,"},"2219":{"dur":2,"text":"but that's something that is just gonna"},"2222":{"dur":4,"text":"totally have great upheaval in the healthcare market,"},"2226":{"dur":3,"text":"to the degree that we've probably never seen,"},"2229":{"dur":3,"text":"for the immediacy of it, so you'll, as people"},"2232":{"dur":2,"text":"who watch public policy and think about healthcare policy,"},"2235":{"dur":1,"text":"you're gonna see a lot of interesting things"},"2237":{"dur":2,"text":"over the summer, going into the fall,"},"2239":{"dur":2,"text":"if that decision is made, but it would be catastrophic"},"2242":{"dur":2,"text":"in the implications it had in the private market,"},"2244":{"dur":1,"text":"for people who still have insurance,"},"2246":{"dur":2,"text":"and for people going through the exchange."},"2248":{"dur":2,"text":"So with that, I know we had a ton of questions,"},"2251":{"dur":2,"text":"so I don't know who has the microphone."},"2253":{"dur":1,"text":"Here's the microphone."},"2255":{"dur":1,"text":"I would love to answer any questions you have,"},"2257":{"dur":1,"text":"either on healthcare or politics,"},"2259":{"dur":2,"text":"or whatever you wanna talk about."},"2261":{"dur":1,"text":"- We will now have time for questions."},"2263":{"dur":1,"text":"If you do have a question, please raise your hand"},"2264":{"dur":2,"text":"and either Zwinn or I will come by with a microphone."},"2267":{"dur":3,"text":"As always, preference goes to students."},"2272":{"dur":1,"text":"- Thank you for your talk."},"2274":{"dur":0,"text":"- Sure."},"2275":{"dur":2,"text":"- So I was wondering about the opting out function"},"2278":{"dur":3,"text":"of Obamacare, because there was a recent study done,"},"2281":{"dur":1,"text":"and now that people are enrolling,"},"2282":{"dur":1,"text":"they have a lot of data on this--"},"2284":{"dur":1,"text":"- Can you all hear his mic?"},"2285":{"dur":1,"text":"Is his mic on?"},"2293":{"dur":0,"text":"Hold it up higher."},"2294":{"dur":2,"text":"- So, people are, now that they're enrolling,"},"2297":{"dur":3,"text":"they have data on their decisions in how they enroll,"},"2300":{"dur":2,"text":"and they've found that some individuals,"},"2302":{"dur":2,"text":"when they are aware of the ability to opt out"},"2305":{"dur":2,"text":"and pay a fine, that many are actually opting out"},"2308":{"dur":2,"text":"and paying that fine, especially young people."},"2310":{"dur":1,"text":"So I was wondering what your thoughts are"},"2311":{"dur":3,"text":"on if that's true and what it's implications are"},"2315":{"dur":1,"text":"for the future of enrollment?"},"2316":{"dur":1,"text":"- What's your first name?"},"2317":{"dur":1,"text":"- My name's Ian."},"2318":{"dur":0,"text":"- Ian."},"2319":{"dur":1,"text":"- Ian, yeah."},"2320":{"dur":4,"text":"- So he's talking about the, you're talking about"},"2324":{"dur":2,"text":"the employer mandate and the individual mandate, right?"},"2326":{"dur":0,"text":"Both?"},"2327":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Ian] It's mostly the individual mandate."},"2329":{"dur":2,"text":"- Okay, so the individual is required to have health"},"2332":{"dur":2,"text":"insurance, this was the whole first Supreme Court argument,"},"2334":{"dur":2,"text":"or they have to pay a tax, and he's suggesting"},"2336":{"dur":3,"text":"that the individual would pay the tax"},"2339":{"dur":1,"text":"instead of having health insurance."},"2341":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, that has bad consequences, if healthy people opt out"},"2344":{"dur":4,"text":"of the system and the risk pool are all the sick people,"},"2348":{"dur":2,"text":"you're gonna have higher rates, as it distorts."},"2350":{"dur":1,"text":"That's why the mandate exists."},"2352":{"dur":1,"text":"But when you have two and half percent"},"2354":{"dur":4,"text":"of income be the penalty, the first year it was 95 bucks."},"2361":{"dur":3,"text":"So, that was not much of a, or one percent."},"2364":{"dur":1,"text":"It was not much of an incentive."},"2366":{"dur":2,"text":"But when it's two and a half percent of your income,"},"2368":{"dur":2,"text":"that starts to be something you need to think about."},"2371":{"dur":2,"text":"And that starts to equate to the actual"},"2373":{"dur":3,"text":"cost of having health insurance, at that point."},"2376":{"dur":2,"text":"So it wouldn't be a wise decision for most people,"},"2379":{"dur":2,"text":"but yeah, theoretically, most people,"},"2381":{"dur":2,"text":"some people could do that."},"2384":{"dur":2,"text":"But I don't think, over time, they would continue"},"2386":{"dur":2,"text":"to do that, unless they're unaware of the law,"},"2389":{"dur":1,"text":"maybe paying taxes for the first time,"},"2391":{"dur":1,"text":"but that would be a one-time mistake."},"2393":{"dur":1,"text":"The bigger issue is the employer market."},"2395":{"dur":1,"text":"Think about the employer penalty,"},"2397":{"dur":2,"text":"which is $2,000 per employee."},"2399":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you're an employer sitting there, and you know"},"2402":{"dur":3,"text":"in the exchange, especially in the urban markets,"},"2405":{"dur":4,"text":"your employees, or anyone operating in the exchange,"},"2409":{"dur":3,"text":"choosing their health plan, can have literally more"},"2413":{"dur":4,"text":"than 100 options, a dozen or more different carriers,"},"2417":{"dur":3,"text":"offering different levels of coverage,"},"2420":{"dur":3,"text":"different packages, 100 different options or more,"},"2423":{"dur":1,"text":"if you go into the exchange, and you're gonna"},"2425":{"dur":4,"text":"get the subsidy, if the subsidy's not stricken down."},"2430":{"dur":3,"text":"Then you have the employer, who's average cost"},"2433":{"dur":4,"text":"per employee for a family healthcare plan is 12 to $15,000."},"2439":{"dur":4,"text":"That's the real cost, but you can pay a $2,000 penalty,"},"2443":{"dur":2,"text":"put your employees in the exchange,"},"2446":{"dur":2,"text":"they're gonna have more choices in the market"},"2448":{"dur":3,"text":"and probably less out of pocket cost,"},"2451":{"dur":3,"text":"because of the subsidy, than you're able to offer them."},"2455":{"dur":2,"text":"And you're gonna save yourself, as a business,"},"2457":{"dur":3,"text":"somewhere between 10 and $12,000 per employee."},"2461":{"dur":2,"text":"What do you think people are gonna do?"},"2464":{"dur":0,"text":"What are employers gonna do?"},"2465":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, there's other reasons why"},"2466":{"dur":1,"text":"employers offer health insurance."},"2468":{"dur":3,"text":"To attract and retain talent and make it a good benefit,"},"2472":{"dur":3,"text":"but when the exchange got off to the horrific"},"2475":{"dur":3,"text":"technological start it did, in the fall of 2013,"},"2479":{"dur":1,"text":"a lot of employers stepped back and said:"},"2480":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't know if I wanna get involved in this,"},"2482":{"dur":2,"text":"but once it starts to be operational"},"2484":{"dur":1,"text":"and the Supreme Court case is behind us"},"2486":{"dur":2,"text":"and people are really comfortable with the law,"},"2488":{"dur":3,"text":"I think it's generally accepted in the CBO,"},"2492":{"dur":3,"text":"when they score this and predict how many people"},"2495":{"dur":2,"text":"are gonna have coverage through the exchange,"},"2497":{"dur":2,"text":"it's gonna only grow; you're gonna see that,"},"2499":{"dur":3,"text":"that market where employers are providing insurance"},"2503":{"dur":4,"text":"start to shrink and more people buying through the exchange."},"2512":{"dur":0,"text":"Who's got the mic?"},"2513":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Man In Audience] Hi, thank you for your talk."},"2515":{"dur":3,"text":"I had a question, when you were talking about the, ah,"},"2519":{"dur":4,"text":"new way that healthcare will work, with the patient not"},"2523":{"dur":2,"text":"ready for the doctor but the doctor ready for the patient."},"2525":{"dur":3,"text":"What do you think the implications are for the care,"},"2528":{"dur":4,"text":"the quality of care, once you flip the table on doctors?"},"2534":{"dur":3,"text":"As a person who's spent a lot of time in hospitals,"},"2537":{"dur":3,"text":"it's not fun to be waiting, but if you're waiting"},"2541":{"dur":3,"text":"for high-quality care, sometimes it's worth it."},"2544":{"dur":3,"text":"Is there any fear, I'd say, that the change"},"2549":{"dur":4,"text":"would devalue the type of care that we get in this country?"},"2553":{"dur":0,"text":"Thank you."},"2555":{"dur":1,"text":"- Well, it's a good question."},"2556":{"dur":1,"text":"Obviously, we do not want to go in that direction,"},"2558":{"dur":1,"text":"but the way you solve that problem, again,"},"2559":{"dur":3,"text":"is by reimbursing based upon the quality of care."},"2563":{"dur":3,"text":"So, if a physician is thinking about the way"},"2567":{"dur":3,"text":"they're gonna handle cases, and their reimbursement"},"2570":{"dur":3,"text":"is based on keeping you healthy and out of the system,"},"2574":{"dur":3,"text":"and they're part of a large group of people,"},"2577":{"dur":1,"text":"and that group is gonna be reimbursed,"},"2579":{"dur":2,"text":"based upon you staying healthy,"},"2582":{"dur":2,"text":"they're gonna pay a lot more attention to you."},"2584":{"dur":3,"text":"When they prescribe a prescription drug to you,"},"2588":{"dur":3,"text":"and you walk out the door, in a fee for service system,"},"2591":{"dur":1,"text":"they don't really have an incentive"},"2592":{"dur":2,"text":"whether or not you take the drug."},"2595":{"dur":1,"text":"You end up back in the office,"},"2596":{"dur":1,"text":"they're gonna make more money."},"2598":{"dur":1,"text":"But if their reimbursement is tied,"},"2600":{"dur":1,"text":"and they're penalized for you showing up"},"2602":{"dur":3,"text":"with the same illness that was preventable,"},"2605":{"dur":2,"text":"then they're gonna be on the phone with you, that night,"},"2607":{"dur":1,"text":"saying: hey, did you take that medicine?"},"2609":{"dur":1,"text":"Are you doing those exercises that we talked about?"},"2611":{"dur":2,"text":"It's really important that you do that."},"2613":{"dur":1,"text":"Simple example, but those are the kind of things"},"2615":{"dur":1,"text":"that you're gonna see, moving forward."},"2617":{"dur":4,"text":"So, I think the type of, the way that physicians"},"2621":{"dur":3,"text":"and all healthcare providers look at the healthcare system"},"2625":{"dur":2,"text":"and look at the way they're interacting with patients"},"2627":{"dur":3,"text":"is gonna change, so what you described is a possible"},"2630":{"dur":2,"text":"outcome in the old system, if you just all of a sudden"},"2633":{"dur":2,"text":"say you can access your provider at any time."},"2635":{"dur":2,"text":"You're gonna go to the one that happens to be available"},"2637":{"dur":3,"text":"right now, but in the new way of reimbursing,"},"2641":{"dur":3,"text":"based upon value, you're gonna see a change in that."},"2645":{"dur":4,"text":"And I don't have as much of a concern about that."},"2655":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Man In Audience] Hi, thank you for your talk."},"2657":{"dur":1,"text":"So, I'm interested in the legislative process."},"2659":{"dur":3,"text":"You mentioned earlier that a lot of people think the, ah,"},"2662":{"dur":1,"text":"law went too far, and some people"},"2664":{"dur":1,"text":"don't think it went far enough."},"2666":{"dur":2,"text":"Obviously, not only was there, as you mentioned,"},"2669":{"dur":3,"text":"heavy lobbying on both sides throughout the debate,"},"2672":{"dur":2,"text":"but there's also special circumstances,"},"2674":{"dur":1,"text":"including Scott Brown's election."},"2676":{"dur":2,"text":"So, do you think, what do you think about the final result?"},"2679":{"dur":1,"text":"Is it an ideal option?"},"2681":{"dur":2,"text":"Do you think we'll ever have a single-payer system?"},"2684":{"dur":1,"text":"And what do you see in the future,"},"2686":{"dur":1,"text":"in terms of the legislative side?"},"2688":{"dur":2,"text":"- That's a lot of questions, a lot to work with."},"2690":{"dur":1,"text":"But, they're good."},"2692":{"dur":3,"text":"The finished product, as I talked about,"},"2695":{"dur":2,"text":"does not do enough on quality and cost."},"2698":{"dur":2,"text":"But it does do a lot on access."},"2702":{"dur":1,"text":"And we should have figured out a way to work"},"2704":{"dur":2,"text":"the Medicaid issue better than we did,"},"2706":{"dur":2,"text":"because that was not consistent with the law."},"2709":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's a big gap, right now."},"2711":{"dur":2,"text":"But I think, five years later,"},"2713":{"dur":2,"text":"it would be impossible to look back"},"2716":{"dur":3,"text":"and say that the strong critics of the bill"},"2719":{"dur":2,"text":"who predicted doom and gloom, and the sky's gonna fall,"},"2722":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's gonna be a catastrophe for the country,"},"2724":{"dur":2,"text":"I think it'd be hard to say that"},"2726":{"dur":1,"text":"that's been what's happened."},"2728":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't think any rational observer could say that."},"2730":{"dur":3,"text":"Most of the critics have proven to be very wrong, you know?"},"2733":{"dur":2,"text":"My concerns were specific to the district"},"2735":{"dur":2,"text":"that I represented and they were specific to,"},"2738":{"dur":2,"text":"again, the cost and quality aspect."},"2740":{"dur":1,"text":"I wasn't one of the ones who was out"},"2742":{"dur":2,"text":"there predicting great doom and gloom."},"2745":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I think as citizens, we should root for our laws"},"2748":{"dur":2,"text":"to succeed; we should not root for failure."},"2751":{"dur":2,"text":"I think there are people in the political system now"},"2753":{"dur":1,"text":"that are rooting for failure, that are hoping"},"2755":{"dur":3,"text":"people feel pain and things go wrong."},"2758":{"dur":1,"text":"Maybe hoping that the Supreme Court rules"},"2760":{"dur":2,"text":"the other way on King versus Burwell,"},"2762":{"dur":1,"text":"so they can point and say: ah, see?"},"2764":{"dur":0,"text":"I told you!"},"2766":{"dur":4,"text":"But, by and large, I think if you look at the way"},"2770":{"dur":1,"text":"the law was supposed to play out,"},"2772":{"dur":2,"text":"it's played out about as well as it could have."},"2774":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, with regard to the single-payer system,"},"2776":{"dur":1,"text":"think about the public option."},"2777":{"dur":3,"text":"I talked to a fair amount of you earlier today about this."},"2780":{"dur":4,"text":"During the debate on the exchanges in the house bill,"},"2784":{"dur":2,"text":"it was talked about to put an option in the exchange"},"2787":{"dur":3,"text":"that would be a federal government-run healthcare system."},"2791":{"dur":1,"text":"Health insurance program."},"2793":{"dur":4,"text":"So you would choose among United and Etna and Cigna"},"2798":{"dur":3,"text":"and Humana and Anthem, and you would have a"},"2804":{"dur":3,"text":"federal government health insurance plan among your choices."},"2807":{"dur":1,"text":"An insurance plan that didn't have to meet"},"2809":{"dur":3,"text":"the same actuarial standards, that could take huge losses"},"2812":{"dur":1,"text":"and set their prices dramatically low,"},"2814":{"dur":3,"text":"and the federal government would pay the losses."},"2817":{"dur":1,"text":"The equivalent of these old gas stations"},"2819":{"dur":3,"text":"that used to set up shop across the street"},"2823":{"dur":3,"text":"and offer gas at half price until the other guy closed,"},"2826":{"dur":2,"text":"and then they would raise their prices back up."},"2828":{"dur":2,"text":"It would have driven all the private health plans"},"2831":{"dur":2,"text":"out of the market, because they couldn't possibly compete"},"2833":{"dur":3,"text":"with a plan that didn't have to meet the same standards."},"2837":{"dur":1,"text":"It could take losses."},"2838":{"dur":4,"text":"So, then, if that happens, until Medicaid was struck,"},"2842":{"dur":3,"text":"you would theoretically have had Medicaid in the beginning,"},"2846":{"dur":3,"text":"and then from 100 to 400 percent of poverty,"},"2849":{"dur":1,"text":"you'd have the exchanges, which de facto"},"2851":{"dur":3,"text":"would be the public option, a federal healthcare plan,"},"2855":{"dur":2,"text":"and then on the other end you'd have employer coverage,"},"2857":{"dur":3,"text":"but then you'd have Medicare, as people aged into it."},"2860":{"dur":3,"text":"So you'd almost have an entire healthcare system"},"2864":{"dur":1,"text":"administered by the federal government."},"2865":{"dur":3,"text":"Especially when you include the DOD and the VA."},"2869":{"dur":1,"text":"That did not sell."},"2870":{"dur":2,"text":"So I can give you a lot of policy reasons"},"2872":{"dur":3,"text":"why I think a single-payer system is a bad idea,"},"2876":{"dur":2,"text":"and there are many, and we can talk about that if you want,"},"2878":{"dur":2,"text":"but it's really not worth thinking about"},"2881":{"dur":3,"text":"from anything other than just having a fun talk,"},"2884":{"dur":1,"text":"because it's politically unrealistic."},"2886":{"dur":2,"text":"Think about the political climate"},"2888":{"dur":2,"text":"when the public option was talked about in 2009."},"2891":{"dur":2,"text":"Before senator Kennedy died, the Democrats had"},"2894":{"dur":3,"text":"a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate."},"2897":{"dur":1,"text":"60 votes in the Senate."},"2899":{"dur":1,"text":"Could have done anything they wanted."},"2900":{"dur":4,"text":"The House had an 80-seat majority, in the House."},"2905":{"dur":3,"text":"And we had a president who was probably willing to go along"},"2909":{"dur":3,"text":"with whatever the Congress sent him, at that time."},"2912":{"dur":3,"text":"And if the public option was so politically unpopular"},"2915":{"dur":3,"text":"in that climate, that the Congress couldn't get"},"2919":{"dur":3,"text":"that through, there's no way they could take the step,"},"2923":{"dur":2,"text":"politically, in today's world or any time"},"2925":{"dur":3,"text":"in the near future, to do something more than that."},"2928":{"dur":2,"text":"A complete, government-run healthcare system."},"2930":{"dur":1,"text":"It's just not politically realistic."},"2932":{"dur":4,"text":"And it wouldn't be popular with the American people."},"2937":{"dur":0,"text":"Got one."},"2939":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Woman In Audience] Hi."},"2940":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, I remember earlier in your talk,"},"2943":{"dur":2,"text":"you were talking a little bit about transparency,"},"2945":{"dur":3,"text":"and you mentioned some things that could be harmful,"},"2948":{"dur":1,"text":"in terms of transparency, and I remember you mentioning"},"2950":{"dur":1,"text":"direct-to-consumer advertising."},"2952":{"dur":2,"text":"So I guess I just wanted to talk a little bit about"},"2954":{"dur":3,"text":"why the Affordable Care Act didn't do anything"},"2958":{"dur":2,"text":"with regards to direct-to-consumer advertising,"},"2961":{"dur":3,"text":"given all of the negative documented consequences"},"2964":{"dur":3,"text":"that we and the, and New Zealand are really"},"2969":{"dur":2,"text":"the only ones that allow for it."},"2971":{"dur":1,"text":"- It was talked about."},"2972":{"dur":4,"text":"The prevailing view is that

consumers,"},"2983":{"dur":3,"text":"theoretically, informing consumers, is not something"},"2987":{"dur":2,"text":"that we're comfortable with in a free society, right?"},"2989":{"dur":2,"text":"But, prescription drug advertising"},"2992":{"dur":2,"text":"was greatly restricted before 1997."},"2996":{"dur":1,"text":"You wouldn't have seen any of these commercials"},"2998":{"dur":3,"text":"where you see the guy riding the horse down the beach"},"3002":{"dur":2,"text":"and you have no idea what this drug is,"},"3004":{"dur":1,"text":"and then at the end it says the name,"},"3006":{"dur":1,"text":"and you're supposed to go to your doctor"},"3007":{"dur":1,"text":"and ask because you saw, you know,"},"3009":{"dur":3,"text":"and that's the kind of, and then they take 30 seconds"},"3012":{"dur":4,"text":"to outline all of the medical complications that can occur."},"3017":{"dur":3,"text":"Those aren't things that used to happen."},"3020":{"dur":2,"text":"So having the patient show up at the doctor's office"},"3023":{"dur":2,"text":"and say: I want this drug."},"3025":{"dur":1,"text":"May not be the best way of doing things."},"3027":{"dur":2,"text":"But you need, with today's, with the internet"},"3030":{"dur":2,"text":"and the ability to research and find information,"},"3032":{"dur":3,"text":"hopefully consumers will be well-informed"},"3035":{"dur":3,"text":"and use that information in a way that is to their benefit."},"3039":{"dur":2,"text":"And can sift through some of the things"},"3041":{"dur":3,"text":"that maybe are a little questionable."},"3047":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Woman In Audience] Hi, congressman."},"3048":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you so much for your talk."},"3050":{"dur":2,"text":"In the beginning of your talk, you spoke a little bit about"},"3052":{"dur":3,"text":"innovations that you guys at Blue Cross Blue Shield"},"3056":{"dur":2,"text":"are working on in terms of, ah,"},"3059":{"dur":4,"text":"I guess, like, healthcare apps and healthcare technology."},"3064":{"dur":1,"text":"And I was wondering if you could speak a little bit about"},"3066":{"dur":2,"text":"how this system, in your view, is helpful"},"3068":{"dur":3,"text":"or harmful to actual, like, medical research"},"3072":{"dur":2,"text":"and progress, not just in terms of technology,"},"3075":{"dur":4,"text":"but in terms of curing things and actual healthcare."},"3079":{"dur":1,"text":"- Oh, yeah, well, all of the things I,"},"3081":{"dur":3,"text":"well, first of all, the app and that more"},"3085":{"dur":4,"text":"current technology, right, that is about access."},"3090":{"dur":4,"text":"That's about prevention, keeping people well in advance."},"3094":{"dur":3,"text":"Because diabetes, for example, in some cases, not all,"},"3098":{"dur":1,"text":"some cases is preventable."},"3100":{"dur":3,"text":"And if you can prevent the onset, or at least delay"},"3103":{"dur":4,"text":"the onset of diabetes, you have dramatically improved"},"3108":{"dur":2,"text":"the life of that person, the quality of life,"},"3111":{"dur":2,"text":"and their family, which is most important."},"3113":{"dur":3,"text":"But you've also saved a ton of money"},"3117":{"dur":2,"text":"for the healthcare system, especially in the aggregate."},"3120":{"dur":2,"text":"We do things, when you think about cost,"},"3123":{"dur":1,"text":"that are pretty simple."},"3124":{"dur":4,"text":"The second largest cause of the increase in healthcare costs"},"3128":{"dur":3,"text":"in the state of Florida is falls for seniors."},"3134":{"dur":2,"text":"Broken hips, stuff like that."},"3137":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, those are very expensive to treat,"},"3140":{"dur":1,"text":"and in some cases are fatal."},"3142":{"dur":2,"text":"So, as I said, the most important thing"},"3144":{"dur":1,"text":"is the quality of life of the patient."},"3146":{"dur":2,"text":"If you can prevent that fall from happening,"},"3148":{"dur":3,"text":"but you also save money, a lot of money,"},"3152":{"dur":1,"text":"by preventing that from happening."},"3153":{"dur":3,"text":"So, one of the things that we do is we will go into the home"},"3157":{"dur":2,"text":"of the senior and sit down and say:"},"3160":{"dur":2,"text":"here are some things you need to think about,"},"3162":{"dur":1,"text":"as far as reconfiguring your house,"},"3164":{"dur":2,"text":"which in some cases, we will help them pay for."},"3167":{"dur":2,"text":"We will also have a conversation about:"},"3169":{"dur":2,"text":"hey, your balance isn't the same as it used to be."},"3172":{"dur":3,"text":"And here are some things that you could do to work on that."},"3176":{"dur":2,"text":"So those are some really simple things"},"3178":{"dur":2,"text":"that aren't even that much about technology."},"3181":{"dur":3,"text":"But when you get into the future of how you keep people well"},"3184":{"dur":1,"text":"it's gonna be all about what I talked about."},"3186":{"dur":3,"text":"Of diagnosing things earlier and treating them"},"3189":{"dur":2,"text":"and figuring out if there's a predisposition."},"3192":{"dur":3,"text":"But I didn't even get into the ethical concerns"},"3195":{"dur":2,"text":"about taking a drop of blood from a baby"},"3198":{"dur":2,"text":"and being able to tell what their propensity is"},"3201":{"dur":3,"text":"to get every disease over the course of their lifetime,"},"3205":{"dur":1,"text":"and kind of predicting what their"},"3207":{"dur":2,"text":"lifetime health is gonna look like."},"3209":{"dur":2,"text":"What does that mean for the insurer,"},"3211":{"dur":1,"text":"if they get ahold of that information?"},"3213":{"dur":1,"text":"What does it mean for their employer,"},"3215":{"dur":1,"text":"if they get that information?"},"3217":{"dur":2,"text":"How do you keep that private, in today's world where"},"3219":{"dur":3,"text":"every day there's a new, giant company that's been hacked."},"3223":{"dur":1,"text":"Those are the kind of things"},"3224":{"dur":1,"text":"that we're gonna have to be careful for."},"3225":{"dur":0,"text":"Go ahead."},"3226":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Woman In Audience] Yeah, I just mean, ah,"},"3228":{"dur":2,"text":"do you think that the new healthcare system,"},"3230":{"dur":2,"text":"especially in Florida, that you're familiar with,"},"3233":{"dur":3,"text":"is conducive to more medical research,"},"3236":{"dur":4,"text":"not just in terms of prevention, but in terms of research."},"3240":{"dur":2,"text":"- If you're asking about Florida, specifically,"},"3243":{"dur":3,"text":"you should all Google Lake Nona, N-O-N-A."},"3246":{"dur":1,"text":"It's outside of Orlando."},"3247":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a medical city where there's miraculous things"},"3250":{"dur":3,"text":"that are being done, Sanford-Burnham is based there."},"3253":{"dur":2,"text":"Their eastern site, California is their first."},"3256":{"dur":1,"text":"Boy, there's a lot of big things"},"3258":{"dur":1,"text":"that are happening there with medical research."},"3259":{"dur":2,"text":"We have a brand new VA, it'll be the second largest"},"3262":{"dur":1,"text":"VA in the country, of course, a lot of medical"},"3263":{"dur":1,"text":"research occurs at the VA."},"3265":{"dur":3,"text":"We have the University of Florida medical research facility"},"3268":{"dur":1,"text":"is based there, and that's just one area."},"3270":{"dur":1,"text":"So yeah, in Florida, there's a lot"},"3272":{"dur":1,"text":"of research that's going on."},"3273":{"dur":1,"text":"And you're here in California."},"3274":{"dur":1,"text":"There's more going on in California"},"3275":{"dur":1,"text":"than there is anywhere in the country."},"3277":{"dur":3,"text":"So, I feel great about where we're gonna be in the future."},"3280":{"dur":3,"text":"It's just, the message I was trying to deliver today"},"3284":{"dur":2,"text":"is just think about where we're going,"},"3286":{"dur":4,"text":"and all the things, all the Pandora's box that gets opened."},"3295":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Man In Audience] Thank you for your talk, congressman."},"3296":{"dur":2,"text":"Not directly related to the ACA,"},"3299":{"dur":1,"text":"but you mentioned at the start of your talk"},"3300":{"dur":2,"text":"that you had some thought to share on redistricting"},"3303":{"dur":3,"text":"and that process, you were effectively redistricted"},"3306":{"dur":2,"text":"out of your seat before the 2012 election"},"3309":{"dur":1,"text":"by a partisan process."},"3311":{"dur":1,"text":"If you have any thoughts to share on reform"},"3313":{"dur":3,"text":"in that are or partisan versus independent commissions,"},"3316":{"dur":1,"text":"I'd love to hear those."},"3318":{"dur":2,"text":"- Thank you for that softball that you threw me."},"3321":{"dur":3,"text":"Yeah, so I do have a very personal interest"},"3324":{"dur":2,"text":"in redistricting, and you can all"},"3327":{"dur":1,"text":"read about that, if you want."},"3328":{"dur":1,"text":"It's instructive."},"3330":{"dur":2,"text":"But, here are my views on redistricting."},"3332":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is interesting for you guys,"},"3334":{"dur":2,"text":"and we took the tour, earlier today,"},"3336":{"dur":2,"text":"where I saw your, a lot of your work"},"3339":{"dur":1,"text":"that's being done on redistricting"},"3341":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's great that you all, here at Claremont McKenna"},"3343":{"dur":2,"text":"are so involved in it, and just the state of California"},"3346":{"dur":2,"text":"doing unique things with these open primaries,"},"3348":{"dur":2,"text":"which I think help to solve some of the problem"},"3350":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm gonna describe, but here's the issue"},"3352":{"dur":3,"text":"with regard to another question I get asked all the time,"},"3356":{"dur":2,"text":"which has the same answer I'm about to give is:"},"3358":{"dur":4,"text":"why is there so much partisanship in Washington?"},"3363":{"dur":1,"text":"And let me answer that question."},"3365":{"dur":1,"text":"It's really simple."},"3366":{"dur":2,"text":"Because we elect partisans."},"3369":{"dur":2,"text":"Our system is designed to elect people"},"3372":{"dur":2,"text":"on the political extreme."},"3374":{"dur":2,"text":"And when you have people in Washington"},"3377":{"dur":3,"text":"that don't look like the rest of the country, politically,"},"3380":{"dur":2,"text":"they're on the fringe, they look like the people"},"3382":{"dur":2,"text":"who are on the political extremes,"},"3384":{"dur":2,"text":"they are not gonna have an incentive to work together."},"3387":{"dur":2,"text":"And the reason that this happens, see,"},"3389":{"dur":4,"text":"most people, think about this, most people are normal folks."},"3394":{"dur":3,"text":"They don't wake up every day thinking about politics."},"3397":{"dur":1,"text":"They're not obsessed with it."},"3399":{"dur":1,"text":"They're worried about who's gonna"},"3400":{"dur":2,"text":"win the basketball game tonight."},"3403":{"dur":2,"text":"Who are the Seattle Seahawks gonna draft in the draft?"},"3406":{"dur":2,"text":"What time is my kid's activity tonight?"},"3408":{"dur":2,"text":"What time does church start on Sunday?"},"3411":{"dur":1,"text":"That's what they're thinking about."},"3412":{"dur":2,"text":"Where are we gonna go on vacation this year?"},"3414":{"dur":1,"text":"They are not thinking about:"},"3415":{"dur":2,"text":"what's my congressman doing in Washington today?"},"3418":{"dur":3,"text":"And what I have found, my personal experience with this,"},"3422":{"dur":3,"text":"and I have a fair amount, is the people who do"},"3427":{"dur":3,"text":"wake up every day thinking about that,"},"3430":{"dur":2,"text":"they have an unhealthy obsession with it."},"3432":{"dur":1,"text":"Generally speaking."},"3434":{"dur":3,"text":"And they are often not the nicest people."},"3437":{"dur":3,"text":"And when you see them, those are the only people"},"3441":{"dur":1,"text":"you encounter; they call your office"},"3443":{"dur":1,"text":"and they show up at your events,"},"3444":{"dur":1,"text":"and they come to your town hall meetings,"},"3445":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's great that people are active and engaged."},"3448":{"dur":1,"text":"I wish more people were."},"3449":{"dur":2,"text":"But when that's the only voice you hear,"},"3452":{"dur":3,"text":"that has a tendency to impact the way you see the world."},"3456":{"dur":2,"text":"And when you go back to Washington,"},"3458":{"dur":1,"text":"you're gonna think about that."},"3460":{"dur":4,"text":"So, when we draw the district lines, in most states,"},"3465":{"dur":3,"text":"unlike California, it is a political process."},"3469":{"dur":3,"text":"And in Pennsylvania, it was a strictly political process."},"3472":{"dur":3,"text":"So you draw the lines to achieve a certain result."},"3475":{"dur":4,"text":"And in most cases, about 380 of the 435 districts"},"3482":{"dur":3,"text":"fit this category, think about that."},"3485":{"dur":2,"text":"The rest are, some are mildly competitive,"},"3487":{"dur":1,"text":"and there's only a small handful"},"3489":{"dur":3,"text":"that are really competitive districts, every year."},"3492":{"dur":1,"text":"Or every two years."},"3494":{"dur":2,"text":"You put all the Republicans in one side,"},"3497":{"dur":2,"text":"and all the Democrats in the other."},"3501":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's what about 380 of those districts look like."},"3504":{"dur":3,"text":"So what are the consequences of that."},"3507":{"dur":2,"text":"We're talking a lot about consequences tonight."},"3510":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, what happens is they don't"},"3512":{"dur":2,"text":"have to worry about the other side."},"3514":{"dur":2,"text":"They don't ever see them, they don't ever hear them."},"3517":{"dur":3,"text":"They never hear a different point of view,"},"3520":{"dur":2,"text":"and every time they go home and say,"},"3522":{"dur":2,"text":"\"I voted 100 percent of the time with my party,\""},"3524":{"dur":1,"text":"they hear: right on!"},"3526":{"dur":1,"text":"And don't you dare compromise!"},"3528":{"dur":1,"text":"Go get 'em; fight!"},"3531":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's the climate that we have."},"3532":{"dur":1,"text":"That's not what the country looks like."},"3534":{"dur":1,"text":"I would say 85 percent of America"},"3536":{"dur":1,"text":"looks like what I described earlier."},"3538":{"dur":3,"text":"They want us, when they think about politics,"},"3541":{"dur":2,"text":"they want us to get along and compromise"},"3544":{"dur":2,"text":"and negotiate and work things out."},"3547":{"dur":2,"text":"And pass bipartisan legislation."},"3549":{"dur":2,"text":"But the reason that that's not incentivized"},"3552":{"dur":3,"text":"is the people who are actually serving in Congress"},"3555":{"dur":1,"text":"don't see the world that way."},"3557":{"dur":2,"text":"To them, it's a game and they're safe."},"3560":{"dur":1,"text":"They don't have to worry about their election."},"3561":{"dur":2,"text":"The only threat that they have is from the extreme."},"3564":{"dur":1,"text":"That they're not conservative enough."},"3566":{"dur":2,"text":"Or they're not liberal enough."},"3568":{"dur":2,"text":"That's the only way they can lose."},"3570":{"dur":1,"text":"And that has an unintended consequence,"},"3572":{"dur":3,"text":"oftentimes, those members don't feel the obligation"},"3575":{"dur":2,"text":"to get out in their communities quite as much."},"3578":{"dur":1,"text":"And you don't have quite as much access to them,"},"3580":{"dur":3,"text":"and there's all kind of policy issues associated with that."},"3584":{"dur":2,"text":"But from the redistricting perspective,"},"3586":{"dur":2,"text":"think about how much different it would be if,"},"3589":{"dur":2,"text":"instead of having all these districts that are solid"},"3591":{"dur":2,"text":"Republican and solid Democrat,"},"3594":{"dur":3,"text":"we had that many districts that were 50\/50."},"3598":{"dur":1,"text":"Half and half."},"3599":{"dur":2,"text":"Think about, 750,000 people is what"},"3602":{"dur":3,"text":"a congressional district is, approximately."},"3605":{"dur":2,"text":"If you have a metropolitan area, or a region,"},"3608":{"dur":2,"text":"with one and a half million people,"},"3610":{"dur":2,"text":"evenly split among Republicans and Democrats,"},"3613":{"dur":3,"text":"you have two choices for drawing that one line"},"3616":{"dur":2,"text":"of how you're gonna have two congressional districts."},"3618":{"dur":2,"text":"You can either make it 50\/50 or you can put"},"3621":{"dur":2,"text":"all the R's on one side and all the D's on the other."},"3624":{"dur":2,"text":"And think about the different type of member of Congress"},"3626":{"dur":2,"text":"you get, based on that one decision"},"3628":{"dur":1,"text":"on how you're gonna draw that line."},"3630":{"dur":1,"text":"You're either gonna get two people"},"3631":{"dur":3,"text":"who are never going to agree, on anything."},"3635":{"dur":2,"text":"They're gonna be opponents of each other"},"3638":{"dur":3,"text":"on almost every issue, and they're never gonna encounter"},"3641":{"dur":2,"text":"different points of view, they're never gonna see"},"3643":{"dur":2,"text":"the other side even exists."},"3646":{"dur":2,"text":"Or, you're gonna get the 50\/50 district,"},"3648":{"dur":2,"text":"you're gonna get two people who are in the center,"},"3651":{"dur":1,"text":"who kinda see the world the same way."},"3653":{"dur":3,"text":"And one might be an R or D, and you're also gonna"},"3656":{"dur":2,"text":"see a lot more turnover, because the political winds"},"3659":{"dur":3,"text":"swing back and forth, and if you represent a 50\/50 district,"},"3662":{"dur":2,"text":"you're probably not gonna be a career politician."},"3665":{"dur":2,"text":"At some point, the pendulum's gonna swing the other way"},"3667":{"dur":1,"text":"and you're gonna have more fresh ideas."},"3669":{"dur":2,"text":"All of that is good for the process."},"3672":{"dur":3,"text":"So what I say about the redistricting process is,"},"3675":{"dur":2,"text":"instead of, some states have the law,"},"3677":{"dur":2,"text":"I believe California is one of them,"},"3680":{"dur":2,"text":"that says you can consider a lot of factors"},"3682":{"dur":1,"text":"when you draw those lines,"},"3684":{"dur":3,"text":"but you cannot consider political affiliation."},"3687":{"dur":1,"text":"Am I right about that, here?"},"3688":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't think you can consider"},"3689":{"dur":1,"text":"whether you're Republican or Democrat."},"3691":{"dur":2,"text":"You can consider all kind of demographic issues."},"3693":{"dur":2,"text":"So, I think it should be the opposite."},"3696":{"dur":2,"text":"I think you should be required to consider political"},"3698":{"dur":2,"text":"affiliation, and you should be required to aspire"},"3701":{"dur":4,"text":"to as close to 50\/50 districts as you can possibly get."},"3705":{"dur":3,"text":"You can't do it in Oklahoma, where President Obama"},"3709":{"dur":2,"text":"lost all 77 counties twice."},"3713":{"dur":2,"text":"You can't do it in Massachusetts, I get that."},"3716":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not perfect, it doesn't work everywhere."},"3718":{"dur":1,"text":"But it works in a lot of places."},"3720":{"dur":2,"text":"It would work in California and Florida and Pennsylvania."},"3722":{"dur":1,"text":"I know that."},"3723":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you did that, you're gonna get sometimes Republicans"},"3727":{"dur":2,"text":"and sometimes Democrats and the pendulum's gonna swing,"},"3730":{"dur":1,"text":"but you're always gonna get people"},"3731":{"dur":3,"text":"that listen to both sides, that have to vote intelligently"},"3735":{"dur":2,"text":"and thoughtfully, instead of just asking their party leader:"},"3737":{"dur":2,"text":"well, how do you want me to vote?"},"3740":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's too much of that that goes on."},"3742":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's how you solve the redistricting problem,"},"3744":{"dur":4,"text":"and by doing that, you also solve the term limits problem,"},"3748":{"dur":1,"text":"with people serving too long"},"3750":{"dur":1,"text":"and getting new people into the system."},"3752":{"dur":2,"text":"Elections every year and all across the country"},"3754":{"dur":2,"text":"would be competitive, instead of just a small handful"},"3757":{"dur":2,"text":"in different pockets of the country."},"3759":{"dur":2,"text":"So, you guys are involved in that right here."},"3761":{"dur":1,"text":"Think about that."},"3762":{"dur":1,"text":"That's, that would be a great way to do it."},"3764":{"dur":1,"text":"And you would have a lot more consensus"},"3766":{"dur":1,"text":"and bipartisanship in Washington,"},"3768":{"dur":2,"text":"and you'd get rid of these kind of loud actors."},"3770":{"dur":2,"text":"And they have a voice, it's a great country,"},"3772":{"dur":1,"text":"everyone should be able to speak,"},"3774":{"dur":2,"text":"but they shouldn't dominate the process."},"3776":{"dur":1,"text":"They shouldn't control the process,"},"3777":{"dur":4,"text":"because it is not representative of the rest of the country."},"3785":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Woman In Audience] Thank you for your talk."},"3786":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm gonna pivot slightly back to, sort of, healthcare."},"3790":{"dur":3,"text":"I am curious, I know a lot of what was going on"},"3793":{"dur":2,"text":"in the discussion, when the ACA was initially"},"3796":{"dur":3,"text":"being debated, with regards to cost saving"},"3799":{"dur":3,"text":"was that it was going to shift from people relying"},"3803":{"dur":3,"text":"on emergency rooms as their primary source of care,"},"3807":{"dur":3,"text":"to people using doctors more, in terms of prevention,"},"3811":{"dur":1,"text":"having regular checkups, things like that."},"3813":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm curious, from your perspective,"},"3815":{"dur":2,"text":"what you think about the effectiveness of that,"},"3817":{"dur":3,"text":"whether you think that the shift is, you know,"},"3821":{"dur":2,"text":"effective, or going to be effective,"},"3823":{"dur":3,"text":"and whether you think that that'll solve"},"3826":{"dur":2,"text":"a lot of the problems that both, sort of individuals"},"3829":{"dur":2,"text":"and healthcare companies and providers"},"3831":{"dur":2,"text":"and hospitals all have, with regards"},"3834":{"dur":3,"text":"to the overburdening of emergency rooms, now."},"3838":{"dur":1,"text":"- Great question."},"3840":{"dur":2,"text":"And one of you, a minute ago, asked me"},"3842":{"dur":1,"text":"what I though about the law"},"3844":{"dur":1,"text":"and what some of the failings were."},"3845":{"dur":3,"text":"To your question, the law is not strong on that point."},"3848":{"dur":2,"text":"In discouraging the use of emergency rooms,"},"3851":{"dur":1,"text":"and that gets into that whole cost"},"3852":{"dur":1,"text":"to quality thing that I talked about."},"3854":{"dur":3,"text":"So the private market is getting involved in this, big time."},"3858":{"dur":3,"text":"And when I talked about the interweaving"},"3861":{"dur":2,"text":"of the different businesses, insurers and providers"},"3864":{"dur":1,"text":"and some of the companies that are out there,"},"3865":{"dur":3,"text":"the Walmarts and Googles, these are things"},"3869":{"dur":2,"text":"that you're gonna see change dramatically."},"3871":{"dur":2,"text":"Because the emergency room is the most inefficient,"},"3874":{"dur":3,"text":"least cost-effective setting you can get care."},"3879":{"dur":1,"text":"You can get good care there,"},"3881":{"dur":1,"text":"but those other two things I just said apply."},"3883":{"dur":4,"text":"So, when you have the opportunity where it's not"},"3887":{"dur":2,"text":"an emergency case, and you're driving down the road"},"3889":{"dur":1,"text":"and you're looking for someone,"},"3891":{"dur":2,"text":"or you're thinking about getting on that kiosk,"},"3893":{"dur":2,"text":"you need to think about the implications"},"3896":{"dur":1,"text":"of the decision that you're making,"},"3897":{"dur":2,"text":"because when people receive care"},"3899":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's not done the right way,"},"3901":{"dur":1,"text":"there's an increased cost of that."},"3902":{"dur":3,"text":"But hospitals, importantly, use the emergency room"},"3906":{"dur":4,"text":"to flow traffic and to admit people into the hospitals"},"3910":{"dur":3,"text":"in most cases, so what you're seeing companies do now,"},"3913":{"dur":2,"text":"and we're one of them in Florida,"},"3916":{"dur":2,"text":"is open up emergency care centers."},"3919":{"dur":1,"text":"We have one in Orlando, about to open up"},"3921":{"dur":2,"text":"another one along the I-4 corridor."},"3924":{"dur":2,"text":"Right across the street from the hospital."},"3926":{"dur":1,"text":"Very close to the hospital."},"3928":{"dur":3,"text":"So, the incentive for this emergency care center"},"3931":{"dur":3,"text":"is not to admit the person to the hospital, right?"},"3935":{"dur":4,"text":"It's not to churn volume, it's to fix their problem."},"3940":{"dur":2,"text":"Which, hopefully, is an emergency if they're there, right?"},"3942":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, that's what it's supposed to be."},"3944":{"dur":2,"text":"You don't want it to be utilized and the space"},"3946":{"dur":2,"text":"taken up by folks who aren't in emergency circumstances."},"3949":{"dur":2,"text":"So when that happens, the hospital,"},"3952":{"dur":2,"text":"through the competition that I talked about earlier,"},"3955":{"dur":2,"text":"they have to adjust the way they do things."},"3957":{"dur":2,"text":"And then that competition starts."},"3960":{"dur":3,"text":"So, as the insurer side, as a company"},"3963":{"dur":2,"text":"that's paying for the cost of that decision that"},"3966":{"dur":3,"text":"that person is making, getting into consumer empowerment,"},"3969":{"dur":2,"text":"you want them to make the most intelligent decision"},"3972":{"dur":2,"text":"for the circumstance that they're in."},"3974":{"dur":3,"text":"And that, in a lot of cases, is not to show up"},"3978":{"dur":2,"text":"at the emergency room, if it can be avoided."},"3980":{"dur":1,"text":"If it's a true emergency and you're in the ambulance,"},"3982":{"dur":1,"text":"that's a totally different story."},"3984":{"dur":3,"text":"But if you're choosing where you're gonna go,"},"3987":{"dur":1,"text":"make the appropriate choice."},"3989":{"dur":2,"text":"Does that answer your question?"},"3993":{"dur":2,"text":"Got one way in the back, here."},"3995":{"dur":2,"text":"- [Woman In Audience] Hi, hello and thank you for your talk."},"3998":{"dur":2,"text":"The way I see, I feel like healthcare is moving towards"},"4000":{"dur":3,"text":"a system where people that weren't previously insured"},"4003":{"dur":2,"text":"and that weren't previously included in the industry"},"4006":{"dur":3,"text":"are becoming included through the ACA."},"4009":{"dur":3,"text":"And as such, Obamacare has helped insure 12 million"},"4013":{"dur":2,"text":"people in the nation, and that is obviously"},"4015":{"dur":2,"text":"a really good thing for the way that healthcare is going,"},"4017":{"dur":3,"text":"but even without those 12 million uninsured population,"},"4021":{"dur":2,"text":"we were already having financial and managerial problems."},"4023":{"dur":2,"text":"Do you see any policy changes that we should make,"},"4026":{"dur":1,"text":"or anything specifically that we should do,"},"4028":{"dur":3,"text":"in order to cater to these 12 million people?"},"4031":{"dur":1,"text":"- Okay, I was having a hard time hearing"},"4033":{"dur":2,"text":"some of what you said, just because of the sound,"},"4035":{"dur":3,"text":"so you were talking about, what, 12 million people?"},"4038":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Woman In Audience] Yeah, so, with Obamacare,"},"4040":{"dur":3,"text":"Obamacare helped insure 12 million people"},"4043":{"dur":2,"text":"that were previously not included in healthcare."},"4046":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, even without those 12 million people,"},"4049":{"dur":2,"text":"we were already having financial and managerial problems."},"4052":{"dur":2,"text":"Do you see anything that we should do, specifically,"},"4054":{"dur":2,"text":"policy-wise, or system-wise, that could be"},"4057":{"dur":2,"text":"implemented to help these 12 million uninsured"},"4059":{"dur":2,"text":"and the previously insured people?"},"4061":{"dur":3,"text":"- First thing we need to do is get more providers"},"4065":{"dur":3,"text":"into the pipeline; is to recruit people"},"4069":{"dur":1,"text":"to get into the medical professions."},"4070":{"dur":3,"text":"Not just physicians, but all medical professions."},"4074":{"dur":3,"text":"And allowing people to practice at the height,"},"4077":{"dur":2,"text":"at the top of their degree."},"4079":{"dur":2,"text":"Whatever they're most capable of doing."},"4082":{"dur":2,"text":"Not shutting them off as some states do."},"4084":{"dur":1,"text":"Again, I don't know California's laws on this,"},"4085":{"dur":1,"text":"but Florida has a really backwards law"},"4087":{"dur":4,"text":"about shutting off the ability of certain practitioners"},"4092":{"dur":3,"text":"to actually do what they're trained to do."},"4095":{"dur":2,"text":"Which diminishes access and creates waiting lines"},"4098":{"dur":3,"text":"and impacts quality of care, so when you have 12 million"},"4101":{"dur":4,"text":"new people, and that number's gonna grow exponentially,"},"4105":{"dur":3,"text":"those are folks, A, who probably have lived without"},"4109":{"dur":4,"text":"insurance for a while and have maybe, because of that,"},"4113":{"dur":2,"text":"made bad healthcare decisions, and may not be"},"4116":{"dur":2,"text":"in the best shape, comparatively,"},"4119":{"dur":2,"text":"to other people who have had insurance."},"4122":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's an issue associated with them immediately"},"4125":{"dur":1,"text":"running out to get treated."},"4127":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's wonderful that they're doing that,"},"4128":{"dur":1,"text":"but somebody's gotta be there"},"4130":{"dur":2,"text":"to answer the door when they show up."},"4132":{"dur":2,"text":"So getting more physicians into the pipeline"},"4134":{"dur":2,"text":"has to be a part of this solution."},"4136":{"dur":2,"text":"And that is something that was a criticism"},"4138":{"dur":3,"text":"of the ACA, we didn't deal with that in the appropriate way"},"4141":{"dur":1,"text":"that we should have, because that's more"},"4143":{"dur":2,"text":"of a training and educational issue."},"4146":{"dur":3,"text":"But that's gonna be what people notice,"},"4150":{"dur":1,"text":"if we don't solve that problem,"},"4151":{"dur":2,"text":"because it is gonna be an access issue"},"4154":{"dur":2,"text":"with all these folks who are new to the system."},"4156":{"dur":1,"text":"It's great that they have insurance now,"},"4157":{"dur":4,"text":"but we've gotta have the appropriate people treating them."},"4163":{"dur":4,"text":"- [Moderator] We have time for one or two more questions."},"4172":{"dur":3,"text":"- [Man In Audience] You gave, as an example, checking my"},"4176":{"dur":4,"text":"app on my phone to find 12 providers in a locality."},"4181":{"dur":2,"text":"My question is, I make that decision,"},"4184":{"dur":4,"text":"how do I know that the, which providers are better or worse?"},"4190":{"dur":3,"text":"And my question to you is to comment on the ability"},"4194":{"dur":3,"text":"of the AMA to really discipline providers"},"4200":{"dur":3,"text":"who have proven to be less than qualified."},"4206":{"dur":2,"text":"- Are you talking about tort reform?"},"4208":{"dur":1,"text":"Like, malpractice reform, too?"},"4210":{"dur":2,"text":"Is that part of what you're getting at?"},"4212":{"dur":2,"text":"- [Man In Audience] Well, in the orthopedic business,"},"4215":{"dur":3,"text":"a back surgery, there's a, I attended a lecture"},"4219":{"dur":2,"text":"over at Casa Colina where one of the surgeons"},"4222":{"dur":2,"text":"was telling about all the problems"},"4224":{"dur":4,"text":"of providers who were less than ethical, in his opinion,"},"4228":{"dur":3,"text":"of providing back surgeries, so the question is,"},"4232":{"dur":3,"text":"how do I, is the AMA, or how would you get"},"4236":{"dur":3,"text":"the AMA to be more efficient, or from state to state,"},"4240":{"dur":1,"text":"because providers can go from"},"4242":{"dur":1,"text":"state to state and get relicensed."},"4244":{"dur":3,"text":"- Yeah, there are things that the insurers and the doctors"},"4247":{"dur":3,"text":"agree on, and there are some that they don't, right?"},"4250":{"dur":2,"text":"The insurance associations and the AMA."},"4253":{"dur":3,"text":"I think one of the things that we don't necessarily see"},"4256":{"dur":3,"text":"eye to eye on are some of these payment reforms"},"4259":{"dur":3,"text":"that I'm talking about, and some of them are gonna solve,"},"4263":{"dur":2,"text":"help solve, the problems that you're talking about."},"4265":{"dur":2,"text":"And I would certainly not, you didn't do this either,"},"4268":{"dur":2,"text":"but I would not suggest or want you to think"},"4270":{"dur":3,"text":"that I'm suggesting that this is a rampant problem"},"4274":{"dur":2,"text":"throughout the system, but there is fraud"},"4276":{"dur":3,"text":"within the system, in South Florida, in particular,"},"4280":{"dur":2,"text":"is notorious for healthcare fraud."},"4282":{"dur":1,"text":"And billing errors."},"4284":{"dur":3,"text":"You do have, ah, a small number of physicians"},"4291":{"dur":3,"text":"who are able to continue, which I think you're getting at,"},"4294":{"dur":4,"text":"to survive in practice in the system by changing venues"},"4298":{"dur":3,"text":"and changing states, if there's been fraud involved,"},"4302":{"dur":3,"text":"but also if there's been medical malpractice involved."},"4306":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's a huge driver in costs, is medical malpractice."},"4311":{"dur":3,"text":"So, the AMA, you know, playing a role in identifying"},"4314":{"dur":2,"text":"and weeding out of the profession people who fit"},"4317":{"dur":2,"text":"that description, which I do think is a smaller number."},"4320":{"dur":2,"text":"But those are things that the ACA"},"4322":{"dur":2,"text":"doesn't do a whole lot about."},"4325":{"dur":2,"text":"Those are more things that the profession, itself,"},"4328":{"dur":3,"text":"needs to self-police, and we can do payment reforms"},"4332":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's gonna address part of that."},"4333":{"dur":3,"text":"But look, there are rules and there are people"},"4336":{"dur":2,"text":"who try to find ways to break the rules,"},"4339":{"dur":2,"text":"and that's gonna be in any business."},"4341":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think that the profession itself,"},"4343":{"dur":2,"text":"the AMA in this case, is gonna be the one"},"4345":{"dur":1,"text":"that's gonna have to figure out a way"},"4347":{"dur":3,"text":"to curtail some of those activities."},"4354":{"dur":1,"text":"Got one more, here."},"4356":{"dur":1,"text":"I was afraid of this question, coming up,"},"4358":{"dur":1,"text":"so we'll see if..."},"4360":{"dur":0,"text":"- [Man In Audience] Thank you for coming."},"4361":{"dur":2,"text":"How does the big pharma play into this,"},"4364":{"dur":3,"text":"as far as new drugs coming out and having really long"},"4367":{"dur":3,"text":"patent process, where how do we balance"},"4370":{"dur":2,"text":"their right to make money and our right"},"4372":{"dur":1,"text":"to get these drugs to the patients,"},"4374":{"dur":2,"text":"in the formularies and the different healthcare?"},"4377":{"dur":3,"text":"- This was a huge issue, when I was in the Congress."},"4381":{"dur":2,"text":"The length of patents, and it's a big issue"},"4383":{"dur":2,"text":"in California, again, you all are doing more"},"4386":{"dur":1,"text":"of this than almost anybody."},"4387":{"dur":3,"text":"So, 20 years in the pipeline, and so the cost"},"4391":{"dur":2,"text":"of prescription drugs, the question I get asked a lot"},"4394":{"dur":3,"text":"is the merits of policy to cap the price"},"4398":{"dur":1,"text":"of prescription drugs, because if you look,"},"4400":{"dur":3,"text":"just Google the rising healthcare costs"},"4403":{"dur":2,"text":"by sector in the healthcare industry."},"4406":{"dur":3,"text":"And what you will find is almost every other sector"},"4410":{"dur":2,"text":"in healthcare costs, adjusted for inflation,"},"4412":{"dur":2,"text":"have remained pretty stable over time."},"4415":{"dur":2,"text":"And then you get to the pharmaceutical industry,"},"4418":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's through the roof."},"4420":{"dur":2,"text":"It literally is off the charts."},"4424":{"dur":2,"text":"It is just exponential increase."},"4426":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's because of some of these medical innovations"},"4429":{"dur":2,"text":"that I told you about, and when you have drugs"},"4431":{"dur":3,"text":"that are working and that people want to have,"},"4435":{"dur":3,"text":"and there's a market for them, because they're saving lives"},"4439":{"dur":1,"text":"or maintaining diseases in a way"},"4441":{"dur":2,"text":"that we weren't able to do before,"},"4443":{"dur":1,"text":"there's gonna be a market for that."},"4444":{"dur":1,"text":"So the issue is the pricing of that,"},"4446":{"dur":3,"text":"and what that does to other insured people."},"4449":{"dur":2,"text":"So the pharmaceutical companies will argue"},"4452":{"dur":1,"text":"that because almost every other country"},"4454":{"dur":1,"text":"in the world has global budgets,"},"4456":{"dur":3,"text":"they cap the price of drugs, that that restricts"},"4459":{"dur":3,"text":"the research and therefore the R&D doesn't get done,"},"4462":{"dur":3,"text":"because the one drug that turns out to be"},"4465":{"dur":2,"text":"the one I just talked about, where you have"},"4467":{"dur":4,"text":"a hepatitis C drug that's a thousand dollars a pill,"},"4471":{"dur":1,"text":"and you take it and it works"},"4473":{"dur":4,"text":"and it can eliminate the hepatitis, that's miraculous."},"4478":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's a benefit to the system."},"4480":{"dur":3,"text":"But that was years in the making, of R&D, of trial"},"4484":{"dur":2,"text":"and error and failure, and eventually they got there."},"4486":{"dur":3,"text":"And the insurance, or the pharmaceutical companies"},"4489":{"dur":2,"text":"will say, well, the nine out of ten times"},"4492":{"dur":3,"text":"that we do that, that we're unsuccessful,"},"4495":{"dur":3,"text":"that it's a dead end, we need to keep trying that."},"4499":{"dur":3,"text":"And if you lock down, if you limit the patent process,"},"4502":{"dur":3,"text":"we can't recover, on the other end, the billions"},"4506":{"dur":3,"text":"of dollars in costs of the R&D that never succeeds."},"4509":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's a meritorious argument."},"4512":{"dur":1,"text":"There's something to that."},"4513":{"dur":3,"text":"But there's also something to the price gouging argument,"},"4517":{"dur":2,"text":"where if you have something that nobody else has,"},"4519":{"dur":3,"text":"and people need it to survive, they'll pay any price."},"4523":{"dur":3,"text":"And if the insurance company's willing to cover it,"},"4526":{"dur":2,"text":"just jack the price up as high as you possibly can."},"4529":{"dur":1,"text":"That is a big problem."},"4530":{"dur":2,"text":"So there is a huge battle in the industry now,"},"4533":{"dur":2,"text":"the insurance industry and the pharmaceutical industry,"},"4535":{"dur":4,"text":"and I spoke recently, in Miami, to the national conference"},"4540":{"dur":4,"text":"of the pharmaceutical folks, and I challenged them."},"4544":{"dur":2,"text":"And I said, which is true: you guys are"},"4547":{"dur":2,"text":"on the wrong side of this thing."},"4549":{"dur":2,"text":"You don't have the public interest at heart."},"4551":{"dur":3,"text":"And they know that at some point, Congress is gonna"},"4555":{"dur":4,"text":"figure this out, and they're gonna fix the problem for them."},"4559":{"dur":2,"text":"Or at least, that is a likely outcome."},"4561":{"dur":1,"text":"Because that might be the only solution,"},"4563":{"dur":2,"text":"if they don't self-police, if they don't figure out"},"4565":{"dur":3,"text":"a way to not just make people pay any price."},"4570":{"dur":2,"text":"So the pharmaceutical companies have an argument."},"4572":{"dur":2,"text":"Yes, we wanna encourage R&D, we don't wanna pass policies"},"4575":{"dur":2,"text":"that restrict their ability to research"},"4577":{"dur":4,"text":"and discover new miracles, but we also wanna have"},"4581":{"dur":2,"text":"an industry that is sympathetic to the cost"},"4584":{"dur":2,"text":"and the impact that it has on the shift,"},"4587":{"dur":3,"text":"throughout the entire insured population,"},"4590":{"dur":1,"text":"in raising rates for everybody."},"4592":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's a push and pull going on there."},"4594":{"dur":1,"text":"But right now, the pharmaceutical"},"4596":{"dur":1,"text":"industry is not doing their part."},"4597":{"dur":1,"text":"They're just running full-speed down the track,"},"4599":{"dur":2,"text":"and they are gonna do whatever they wanna do,"},"4602":{"dur":2,"text":"until probably Congress steps in."},"4604":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that's the only way this is gonna happen."},"4606":{"dur":3,"text":"And they may set a cap on drug prices."},"4610":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't know if they'll set a cap on what we can spend,"},"4612":{"dur":2,"text":"as a country, which is what other countries have done,"},"4615":{"dur":2,"text":"but they may set some sort of artificial cap"},"4618":{"dur":3,"text":"on specific drugs and say: you cannot charge more"},"4621":{"dur":4,"text":"than this amount, or this amount over the cost of,"},"4625":{"dur":4,"text":"of the research that went into making that specific drug."},"4632":{"dur":2,"text":"That's not good policy, I don't think,"},"4634":{"dur":2,"text":"but if the industry doesn't do it themselves,"},"4637":{"dur":2,"text":"that's what will happen."},"4639":{"dur":2,"text":"- Unfortunately, that is all the time we have."},"4642":{"dur":2,"text":"Please join me in thanking congressman Jason Altmire."},"4644":{"dur":2,"text":"- Thank you all very much."}}
