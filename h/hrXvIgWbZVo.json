have time pass,"},"1183":{"dur":1,"text":"because our show\nis 90 minutes long."},"1185":{"dur":3,"text":"And a novel can\ntake a lot of time."},"1189":{"dur":2,"text":"So there are a lot of\nscenes in the play."},"1192":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, the major thing that\nwe had to come up with first"},"1195":{"dur":3,"text":"was how to tell the story of\nnow one night passes, now

be,"},"1211":{"dur":2,"text":"and where the play\nneeds to breathe,"},"1214":{"dur":3,"text":"and where the play\nneeds to get tauter."},"1217":{"dur":3,"text":"So the music and sound\nand lighting

is"},"1302":{"dur":1,"text":"the tone is really interesting."},"1303":{"dur":3,"text":"Because it's both scary,\nand psychological,"},"1306":{"dur":2,"text":"and suspenseful, and at\nthe same time, very funny."},"1309":{"dur":2,"text":"And the thing that music\ncan do better than anything"},"1311":{"dur":2,"text":"is destroy humor."},"1313":{"dur":2,"text":"So my first job,\nin a funny way, was"},"1316":{"dur":3,"text":"to not kill what the actors\nwere doing beautifully,"},"1319":{"dur":1,"text":"that as soon as you\nadd music under it,"},"1321":{"dur":3,"text":"the audience is just sitting\nthere and nothing happens."},"1324":{"dur":2,"text":"So like Will said, getting\nout of the actor's way"},"1327":{"dur":1,"text":"is part of my job."},"1328":{"dur":3,"text":"But the fun

sees the show,\nthe final cue of the show"},"1340":{"dur":3,"text":"is completely tasteless."},"1344":{"dur":6,"text":"But one of the fun things in\nthe show is that in the

with all of this?"},"1416":{"dur":1,"text":"LEON ADDISON BROWN: I do."},"1418":{"dur":3,"text":"The difficult thing about\nit is that I warm up,"},"1421":{"dur":1,"text":"and then I have to wait."},"1423":{"dur":1,"text":"So by the time I\nget on, I'm feeling"},"1424":{"dur":1,"text":"like I need to warm up again."},"1426":{"dur":1,"text":"Then you're on for\nthat little short time,"},"1428":{"dur":1,"text":"and then you wait again."},"1429":{"dur":3,"text":"So that part of it is\ndifficult, just staying in it."},"1433":{"dur":2,"text":"So I listen to the\nwhole show every

second."},"1455":{"dur":2,"text":"Because I believe that it's\njust brilliantly designed."},"1457":{"dur":1,"text":"And I hope you can\ncomment on-- hopefully,"},"1459":{"dur":1,"text":"you have some

set, for those who will go\nsee it-- I'm not giving things"},"1467":{"dur":2,"text":"away, because the first thing\nthat happens is the whole set"},"1469":{"dur":4,"text":"turns-- there's four

rooms,"},"1481":{"dur":1,"text":"or three rooms and outside."},"1483":{"dur":3,"text":"And part of the white walls move\nto shift around for the actors,"},"1486":{"dur":1,"text":"to give you guys more space."},"1487":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think it's\nabsolutely brilliant."},"1490":{"dur":2,"text":"How did that set come to be?"},"1493":{"dur":2,"text":"It's very unique compared to\nanything I've seen before."},"1495":{"dur":1,"text":"WILL FREARS: It came\nto be, actually,"},"1497":{"dur":3,"text":"in a very specific way, which\nis that David Korins, who's not"},"1500":{"dur":4,"text":"here, and I were having a\nsort of early conversation"},"1504":{"dur":1,"text":"about what we wanted\nit to be like."},"1506":{"dur":1,"text":"And we felt very strongly."},"1508":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, it all comes back\nto the same idea, which"},"1510":{"dur":1,"text":"is making room for the actors."},"1514":{"dur":2,"text":"We wanted to put Annie's\nhouse on the stage."},"1517":{"dur":2,"text":"We didn't want to have\nan idea about a house,"},"1519":{"dur":4,"text":"or some comment from\noutside, or an opinion."},"1523":{"dur":3,"text":"We wanted to give her the\nplace where she lived,"},"1526":{"dur":3,"text":"that we could reveal more story\nthat way, that we could find--"},"1530":{"dur":2,"text":"and that we wanted-- and this\nwas a word we used endlessly--"},"1533":{"dur":1,"text":"we wanted claustrophobia."},"1534":{"dur":2,"text":"We wanted a kind of super\nclaustrophobic realism."},"1537":{"dur":3,"text":"And so anytime you\nbreak the plane,"},"1541":{"dur":1,"text":"you allow the\naudience to breathe."},"1542":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's why we don't\nhave an intermission."},"1544":{"dur":2,"text":"It's why there's no blackouts."},"1547":{"dur":1,"text":"There aren't meant\nto be rest moments."},"1549":{"dur":5,"text":"And so the idea was let's\nput her whole house on stage."},"1554":{"dur":2,"text":"And then once we go--\nwhen the house moves,"},"1557":{"dur":2,"text":"we want to follow-- we\nwant to be in real time."},"1560":{"dur":2,"text":"It is, again, the thing\nMichael was saying about,"},"1562":{"dur":1,"text":"like we go back all the time."},"1563":{"dur":2,"text":"And when the house\nis in motion, we"},"1565":{"dur":1,"text":"want it to be really\nin motion, happening"},"1567":{"dur":1,"text":"in front of your eyes."},"1568":{"dur":2,"text":"And so the idea was to\njust try and jam it all."},"1571":{"dur":1,"text":"I remember David\ncalling me one day"},"1572":{"dur":2,"text":"and saying-- or me calling him\nand saying, how's it going?"},"1575":{"dur":2,"text":"He said, I'm almost\nbeing a good set"},"1577":{"dur":3,"text":"designer, because I've almost\ngot it all on the turntable."},"1580":{"dur":1,"text":"And before that,\nwe would have bits"},"1582":{"dur":2,"text":"like, oh, we can't get the\nstairs on the turntable."},"1585":{"dur":1,"text":"And we just kept compressing it."},"1586":{"dur":2,"text":"And every time we\ncompressed it, it"},"1589":{"dur":1,"text":"got more claustrophobic\nand more real."},"1591":{"dur":2,"text":"And we just kept pushing\nit further and further"},"1593":{"dur":3,"text":"And then you and\nDavid would talk about"},"1597":{"dur":2,"text":"what was in the house,\nso that everything"},"1600":{"dur":4,"text":"has texture and detail and\nis informed by the story,"},"1604":{"dur":3,"text":"not just comment from outside."},"1608":{"dur":2,"text":"And also, that I\nwas always taken"},"1610":{"dur":3,"text":"by the idea of a cabin in the\nwoods and a kind of \"Hansel"},"1614":{"dur":2,"text":"and Gretel\" kind\nof feeling of like,"},"1616":{"dur":2,"text":"that I thought it was important\nto have the desolation,"},"1618":{"dur":1,"text":"to really feel that\nthis was happening"},"1620":{"dur":2,"text":"in the middle of nowhere."},"1623":{"dur":1,"text":"So that was how we did it."},"1624":{"dur":2,"text":"And we just kept\ngoing with that idea"},"1627":{"dur":2,"text":"instead of pushing it\nfurther and further."},"1629":{"dur":1,"text":"ALAN SEALES:
