active randing and"},"1089":{"dur":3,"text":"we've kinda slimmed it down and you can see\nthat in the old version we just had this kinda"},"1093":{"dur":3,"text":"big chunky bit of orange rubber that used\nto sit up here and kinda same thing up here."},"1097":{"dur":4,"text":"We've just trimmed that down so it now sits\nmore cleanly with the closure on that side."},"1101":{"dur":3,"text":"We've also taken some of the bulk out of the\nheel on the outside, that just means that"},"1105":{"dur":2,"text":"the heel cup is a lot more comfortable."},"1107":{"dur":4,"text":"The Origin doesn't have the active randing,\nthe Force V does have the active randing."},"1112":{"dur":3,"text":"And then we flip over the shoe and we can\nsee here we've got this Vision rubber and"},"1115":{"dur":1,"text":"here we got the XS Edge."},"1117":{"dur":3,"text":"Both are really, really durable but maybe\nthis is a bit stickier."},"1120":{"dur":3,"text":"This is going to be a great shoe that more\nadvanced climbers are going to use as their"},"1124":{"dur":4,"text":"comfortable shoe in all sorts of situations,\nsport, trad that kinda thing."},"1128":{"dur":3,"text":"In men's and, uh, the Force V in girl's."},"1131":{"dur":5,"text":"Again, like the Origin we just spoke about,\num, us a women's specific last not just different"},"1136":{"dur":1,"text":"colors."},"1137":{"dur":2,"text":"$129, it's a really really strong shoe."},"1140":{"dur":2,"text":"Here is the Instinct VSR."},"1143":{"dur":3,"text":"We've got that highly charged Bi-Tension active\nranding"},"1146":{"dur":1,"text":"that gives that kind of explosive power."},"1148":{"dur":2,"text":"A thickly ribbed toe rand and toe patch."},"1150":{"dur":2,"text":"The best technical heel cup that's out there."},"1152":{"dur":3,"text":"The important difference really is that we've\nactually applied XS Grip2."},"1156":{"dur":4,"text":"This shoe is, I guess, a much softer, more\nsupple example of this."},"1161":{"dur":2,"text":"It's going to fit more snugly."},"1163":{"dur":4,"text":"It's going to suit the smaller, lighter climber,\nconform to the holds under their weight in"},"1167":{"dur":2,"text":"a sort of slightly easier manner than this\nshoe."},"1170":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's it, the Instinct VSR."},"1175":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the, uh, the Runner and the Runner\nLV."},"1177":{"dur":4,"text":"We ran the rand rubber to basically change\ncolor and to look like a sole of a sneaker."},"1182":{"dur":1,"text":"Downturned pretty good."},"1184":{"dur":1,"text":"We have a fishhook midsole on the inside."},"1185":{"dur":4,"text":"And we used our Unparalleled rubber, the black\nrubber, which is our own rubber."},"1190":{"dur":4,"text":"And then this is the first time ever that\nwe've actually put color in climbing rubber,"},"1194":{"dur":4,"text":"so we actually were able to infuse color into\nthe carbon rubber and have a sticky outsole,"},"1199":{"dur":1,"text":"uh, on the all blue one."},"1201":{"dur":2,"text":"The price point is like $119 at retail."},"1203":{"dur":3,"text":"A pretty soft shoe that could hang on the\nshelf right next to a really expensive model."},"1207":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is the Street."},"1208":{"dur":1,"text":"It's uh, just black on black."},"1210":{"dur":2,"text":"Really simple, all synthetic so it's not going\nto stretch."},"1213":{"dur":1,"text":"It's downturned."},"1214":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a really soft shoe as well."},"1215":{"dur":2,"text":"There is a midsole but it's not insanely thick."},"1217":{"dur":3,"text":"You're going to have a lot of comfort but\nin a downturned model."},"1220":{"dur":1,"text":"The heel we didn't put a whole lot of tension\non."},"1222":{"dur":3,"text":"A lot of intermediate climbers are actually\nbuying this shoe because of its comfort."},"1226":{"dur":4,"text":"The padded tongue, the softness, you're getting\nthe features of a really high end shoe for"},"1231":{"dur":5,"text":"a really good price and a really good transition\nto something really advanced."},"1236":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is our new shoe, and it's called the\nFree Range."},"1239":{"dur":3,"text":"We built it on the same last as the Street\nshoe."},"1242":{"dur":1,"text":"We did a one strap closer."},"1243":{"dur":3,"text":"Put a bunch of rubber all over the toe box,\nuh, but kept it really thin."},"1247":{"dur":1,"text":"We put a lot more tension on the heel."},"1248":{"dur":1,"text":"And the price point on this is $149."},"1250":{"dur":4,"text":"We want it to be able to sit next to any $179,\n$189 shoe."},"1254":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is a new shoe call the One."},"1257":{"dur":4,"text":"The first cool thing we did is this synthetic\nupper is actually one piece,"},"1261":{"dur":1,"text":"it's like a no-sew upper."},"1263":{"dur":1,"text":"It's really insanely comfortable."},"1265":{"dur":4,"text":"So we put it on a pretty flat last but we\nput a lot of, uh, tension in the heel."},"1269":{"dur":3,"text":"Like even compared to the, our Street shoe,\nit has a lot more tension."},"1272":{"dur":4,"text":"We actually added in this binding on the tongue\nso what that actually does is it holds the"},"1276":{"dur":3,"text":"shoe on your foot while you're warming up\nand technically you don't really even have"},"1280":{"dur":3,"text":"to lace the shoe unless you're ready to climb\nsomething pretty difficult."},"1283":{"dur":1,"text":"So these are the Kicks."},"1284":{"dur":3,"text":"We did a regular volume and a low volume as\nwell."},"1288":{"dur":4,"text":"We put the all, uh, all blue outsole and we\nstuck with our traditional black rubber on"},"1292":{"dur":1,"text":"this one."},"1293":{"dur":1,"text":"It's a really simple, fast closure."},"1295":{"dur":4,"text":"We put a super fat tongue on there so it looks\nlike you're wearing a street shoe or skate shoe."},"1300":{"dur":2,"text":"They're both leather so they're going to stretch\nand they're going to be really comfortable."},"1303":{"dur":2,"text":"The last is really flat it's not downturned\nor hooked."},"1306":{"dur":2,"text":"And we put a decent amount of support in the\nmidsole."},"1309":{"dur":4,"text":"It's not insanely stiff but definitely a little\nbit stiffer than some of our other shoes."},"1313":{"dur":4,"text":"So really good for the gym or transitioning\noutside for beginner and intermediate."},"1317":{"dur":1,"text":"So this is called the Bowler."},"1318":{"dur":1,"text":"This is like our really entry model."},"1320":{"dur":3,"text":"Initially made it as a rental shoe but when\nwe put it on Kickstarter it did really well."},"1324":{"dur":4,"text":"A lot of the traditional bowling shoes have\nsplit leather, so different color leather"},"1328":{"dur":2,"text":"on the internal and external side of the shoe."},"1330":{"dur":1,"text":"It's really comfortable."},"1331":{"dur":3,"text":"It's all leather, it's going to stretch, um,\nthere's giant padding in the tongue."},"1335":{"dur":4,"text":"There's not much tension on the heel at all\nand we ran the external rubber parallel to"},"1339":{"dur":3,"text":"the ground so when you see it on the wall\nit looks like someone is wearing a pair of"},"1343":{"dur":1,"text":"street shoes, it's just pretty neat."},"1345":{"dur":3,"text":"Uh, this one definitely has a midsole that's\ngoing to keep it pretty stiff but you can"},"1348":{"dur":3,"text":"see it's actually kind of like a soft more\ncomfortable shoe, so."}}
