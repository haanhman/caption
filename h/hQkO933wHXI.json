that."},"163":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm truly delighted to be here today\nbecause I'm fascinated by the process of"},"167":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm a statistician, so there's\nclearly a lot of statistics in here."},"171":{"dur":3,"text":"The director of the data\nscience initiative, so"},"174":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm very interested in the entire\ndata pipeline from data"},"177":{"dur":2,"text":"acquisition all the way\nto reporting the results."},"180":{"dur":3,"text":"And clearly you guys are very\nmuch at the forefront of that."},"184":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm very interested in changing\nhow social science is done."},"187":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm very interested to see\nhow you're going to do"},"190":{"dur":4,"text":"this because it has major impact on a lot\nof other fields so you're at the forefront"},"195":{"dur":3,"text":"at this along with a few other-\n>> Very different takes on"},"198":{"dur":1,"text":"the reproducibility issues."},"200":{"dur":4,"text":"Brad and others have developed a terrific\nprogram today, covering a very broad,"},"204":{"dur":3,"text":"extraordinarily broad,\nwhen I was reading the agenda."},"207":{"dur":2,"text":"But then it was like, wow,\nthere's a very coherent theme"},"210":{"dur":3,"text":"covering the reproducibility crisis,\nas some call it, and some disagree."},"213":{"dur":1,"text":"And I'm And"},"215":{"dur":3,"text":"even that is controversial which means\nthat the actual research must be too."},"219":{"dur":3,"text":"But I'm very glad that it actually\naddresses some very concrete proposals for"},"222":{"dur":2,"text":"actually how we're actually going\nto solve this, but they are very,"},"225":{"dur":3,"text":"very broad to dealing with the technical\naspects of statistical analysis and"},"229":{"dur":3,"text":"p values and\nall the methodology that we're developing."},"232":{"dur":5,"text":"To peer review for publication and\njournals and how they operate."},"237":{"dur":3,"text":"Important to me is what is published, so\nthis notion of data and software and code."},"241":{"dur":5,"text":"I publish software,\nwhich is a very odd thing in academia."},"247":{"dur":4,"text":"But data itself and publication of data\nis becoming extraordinarily important and"},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"not obvious how we actually do it and\ngive credit."},"254":{"dur":3,"text":"But also very important to me is part\nof the Data Science Initiative with"},"258":{"dur":1,"text":"Tracy here,\nTracy Teal from Data Carpentry."},"259":{"dur":3,"text":"How are we to change\nthe educational goals and"},"263":{"dur":2,"text":"the curricula that we have\nto actually teach for"},"266":{"dur":3,"text":"people to learn essentially a whole\nextra set of tools for their research."},"269":{"dur":1,"text":"This is very, this is a real challenge,"},"271":{"dur":3,"text":"so congratulations for\norganizing such a very broad topic."},"276":{"dur":3,"text":"Some issues to me and I was having\nthis conversation yesterday at dinner."},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"Why is this complicated?"},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"For very, very many reasons,\nas a statistician,"},"285":{"dur":5,"text":"I'm in this era of big data and\nmany people aren't, okay?"},"290":{"dur":2,"text":"So you have very low statistical power."},"293":{"dur":2,"text":"And that this is a serious\nproblem that you cannot overcome."},"295":{"dur":4,"text":"We can't just assume things away with\ngood methodology that doesn't apply."},"301":{"dur":4,"text":"Also again, talking yesterday to\na lot of the data are derived from"},"306":{"dur":4,"text":"complex data in the form of images and\naudio and video and"},"310":{"dur":4,"text":"subject to human interpretation of\nwhat the actual data The analyzed are."},"314":{"dur":1,"text":"This is complicated."},"316":{"dur":2,"text":"This makes the pipeline\nextremely difficult."},"318":{"dur":1,"text":"Much more complicated than\nwe statisticians have to"},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"deal with where we assume\nthe data come to us."},"325":{"dur":1,"text":"Often the data do not measure\nwhat we think they do."},"327":{"dur":4,"text":"And\n>> When the scope of inference is entirely"},"331":{"dur":3,"text":"wrong and the methodology does not correct\nfor this, or smack us around the place."},"335":{"dur":4,"text":"And likewise, I sit in a statistics\ndepartment that generates paper after"},"339":{"dur":4,"text":"paper of new Complex methods [LAUGH] that\nare not easy or transparent to use, and"},"343":{"dur":3,"text":"we do not understand their operating\ncharacteristics unnecessarily."},"347":{"dur":3,"text":"And certainly people who are just\nusers may not understand them, or"},"351":{"dur":4,"text":"even have the intuition about where\nthe randomness applies to the statistical"},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"estimates that are coming."},"357":{"dur":2,"text":"Then we tend to do a lot of mathematics\nrather than a lot of intuition,"},"360":{"dur":0,"text":"which is a problem."},"361":{"dur":3,"text":"One of the things that we were talking\nabout yesterday was this notion of can we"},"364":{"dur":5,"text":"actually use machine learning for at least\nvalidating the human scoring of video and"},"370":{"dur":4,"text":"images or actually just replacing it so\nthat we can get reproducability or"},"374":{"dur":3,"text":"as just a validation if nothing else so\nthat we can at least identify problems."},"378":{"dur":5,"text":"I'm also delighted to see a lot\nof different disciplines here,"},"383":{"dur":3,"text":"beautifully nicely arranged social\nsciences, not too big, not too small, and"},"387":{"dur":5,"text":"because the multi disciplinarity of data\nscience is really important because we're"},"392":{"dur":4,"text":"all sharing these problems in very, very\ndifferent ways but we also we can borrow"},"397":{"dur":4,"text":"strengths from different places and I just\nlike to mention too cuz it's a slightly"},"401":{"dur":4,"text":"different focus, I come from a culture of\nsoftware, open source software and open"},"405":{"dur":4,"text":"code which is a really important vehicle,\nopen data and linked data are becoming"},"410":{"dur":3,"text":"extremely important The dynamically\ncomputed documents, which actually just"},"414":{"dur":3,"text":"reproduced the computations not\nthe actually, necessarily the thinking."},"417":{"dur":5,"text":"But they are at least a sort of\na forensic track of what's going on."},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"And data work flows and data providence\nin CS are very very important."},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"And I hope somehow we can\nembrace all of these things and"},"428":{"dur":3,"text":"sort of share and exchange good ideas."},"433":{"dur":4,"text":"And the other thing that I have noticed\nin looking at this is, boy, every single"},"437":{"dur":3,"text":"aspect of the research process is\ntouched from the researchers themselves,"},"440":{"dur":4,"text":"to The peer reviewers, to the actual\njournal editors deciding what to"},"444":{"dur":4,"text":"publish and What not to publish and\nwhat the replication,"},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"what's the value of replication are And\nall that sort of stuff."},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"Also, of publishing data but\nthen, as they say,"},"455":{"dur":3,"text":"closing the loop back to what sort of\neducation do we actually need her to do?"},"458":{"dur":2,"text":"This leaves nothing essentially untouched."},"460":{"dur":4,"text":"You know our entire process,\nwhich means essentially we should go home."},"465":{"dur":5,"text":"[LAUGH] Academia changes slowly but we\nwant to change it all essentially One go."},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'm optimistic [LAUGH]."},"472":{"dur":1,"text":"Why?\nBecause we are collecting data,"},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"we are able to collect data so\nquickly, everything is changing."},"476":{"dur":3,"text":"We're able to use iPods, iPod Touches as\nwe were talking about yesterday, we're"},"480":{"dur":4,"text":"able to use video cameras to collect data\nand then to analyse it in different ways."},"484":{"dur":4,"text":"Just the momentum in the technology\nis actually hopefully"},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"going to change some of our culture,"},"490":{"dur":4,"text":"at least just challenge it ridiculously so\nthat we have to think a little bit more."},"494":{"dur":4,"text":"I just hopefully quickly."},"498":{"dur":3,"text":"Data science,\nmany people in the social science say"},"502":{"dur":3,"text":"well data science has very little to do\nwith us, we don't have big data, so for"},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"some reason there's big data science and\nbig data seem to be synonymous."},"510":{"dur":4,"text":"Data science is about complex data and\ncomplex data can be 2 data points but"},"514":{"dur":5,"text":"there's a lot of complexity behind them,\nok so first of all we want to engage with"},"519":{"dur":5,"text":"people What you may not call big data or\ndata signs, we do."},"525":{"dur":1,"text":"But very, very important data signs and"},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"a lot of people are missing\nthe point about data signs."},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not just about applying\nmachine learning and"},"531":{"dur":3,"text":"high performance computing and the state\nof the art technology, but it's actually"},"535":{"dur":3,"text":"about understanding the process of\nScientific discovery that is data driven."},"539":{"dur":4,"text":"So, we actually want to go back and\nsee what works and what doesn't"},"543":{"dur":4,"text":"work which I think is very much in line\nwith what you're talking about today."},"548":{"dur":3,"text":"And what I also think is,\nit's largely a social and"},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"a cultural element in what we're doing."},"553":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, who should study social and\ncultural aspects of science."},"557":{"dur":1,"text":"You guys."},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"[LAUGH] And we also think we should,"},"561":{"dur":2,"text":"because we wanna study from\na technical point of view."},"563":{"dur":3,"text":"So we're very keen to actually liase with\nyou on actually understanding how science"},"566":{"dur":4,"text":"is done, and how we can actually\nexploit data-driven science."},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"I will just, Joe Dumit,\ndirector of the ISS,"},"573":{"dur":5,"text":"told me that I needed to tell you that, I\nneeded to plug the Data Science Initiative"},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"on campus, so I'm going to do that."},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'm the director of this\ndata science initiative,"},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"which we have on campus\nin Shields Library."},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"We put out a call for projects for people."},"587":{"dur":5,"text":"This is an ongoing call where we\nwould like to collaborate with you."},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"We do not have the data science expertise,\nbut we have really interesting questions."},"595":{"dur":1,"text":"Can you help us to do\nqualitatively new research."},"597":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's when we are poised and"},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"ready to do this and\nwe're begging for people to come."},"602":{"dur":5,"text":"We already have numerous projects lined\nup but we're very much looking for more."},"607":{"dur":1,"text":"And this ranges as I say\nfrom data acquisition,"},"609":{"dur":3,"text":"which a lot of people are doing\nfrom scraping data off the web and"},"612":{"dur":2,"text":"APIs all the way through data management,\ncleaning, visualization,"},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"statistical analysis,\nmachine learning and so forth."},"617":{"dur":1,"text":"And dealing with large amounts of data."},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"so there's a website called\nDSI dot UC Davis dot edu."},"623":{"dur":1,"text":"Follow the seminar."},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"No, you're good at that."},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"So just to conclude you're\ndoing extraordinarily"},"629":{"dur":4,"text":"important work of great value to all\nof us, not just in the social sciences."},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"I only have to be here Now, but I'm gonna\nstay all day except for one hour when I"},"639":{"dur":3,"text":"have to run to a committee, but I'm\nfascinated to find out what happens and"},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"I'd really like to\ncollaborate with you all so"},"644":{"dur":3,"text":"thank you for\nall of your hard work and it's impact."},"648":{"dur":2,"text":"Thank you."},"650":{"dur":8,"text":"[APPLAUSE]"}}
