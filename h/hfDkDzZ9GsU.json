11,"},"347":{"dur":3,"text":"it's more likely that Tommy will have\nto have repeated a grade."},"353":{"dur":3,"text":"Research shows that kids\nwho do not have consistent

and nutrition is the number one cause\nof preventable death and disease"},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"in this country, by far."},"407":{"dur":3,"text":"And fully a third of the kids\nthat we've been talking about tonight"},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"are on track to have diabetes\nin their lifetime."},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, what's hard\nto put together but is true"},"417":{"dur":2,"text":"is that, many times,\nthese are the same children."},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"So they fill up on the unhealthy\nand cheap calories"},"423":{"dur":4,"text":"that surround them in their communities\nand that their families can afford."},"428":{"dur":1,"text":"But then by the end of the month,"},"431":{"dur":3,"text":"food stamps run out\nor hours get cut at work,"},"435":{"dur":3,"text":"and they don't have the money\nto cover the basic cost of food."},"440":{"dur":3,"text":"But we should be able\nto solve this problem, right?"},"443":{"dur":1,"text":"We know what the answers are."},"445":{"dur":4,"text":"As part of my work at the White House,\nwe instituted a program"},"450":{"dur":3,"text":"that for all schools that had\n40 percent more low-income kids,"},"453":{"dur":3,"text":"we could serve breakfast and lunch\nto every kid in that school."},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"For free."},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"This program has been\nincredibly successful,"},"462":{"dur":4,"text":"because it helped us overcome\na very difficult barrier"},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"when it came to getting kids\na nutritious breakfast."},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"And that was the barrier of stigma."},"473":{"dur":4,"text":"See, schools serve\nbreakfast before school,"},"479":{"dur":4,"text":"and it was only available\nfor the poor kids."},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"So everybody knew who was poor\nand who needed government help."},"489":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, all kids, no matter how much\nor how little their parents make,"},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"have a lot of pride."},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"So what happened?"},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, the schools that have\nimplemented this program"},"501":{"dur":4,"text":"saw an increase in math and reading\nscores by 17.5 percent."},"506":{"dur":1,"text":"17.5 percent."},"509":{"dur":4,"text":"And research shows that when kids\nhave a consistent, nutritious breakfast,"},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"their chances of graduating\nincrease by 20 percent."},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"20 percent."},"523":{"dur":3,"text":"When we give our kids\nthe nourishment they need,"},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"we give them the chance to thrive,"},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"both in the classroom and beyond."},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, you don't have to trust me on this,"},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"but you should talk to Donna

coming,"},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"and overhaul her nutrition standards."},"568":{"dur":4,"text":"She improved and added\nfruit and vegetables and whole grains."},"572":{"dur":2,"text":"She served breakfast in the classroom\nto all of her kids."},"576":{"dur":1,"text":"And she implemented a dinner program."},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"Why?"},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, many of her kids didn't have\ndinner when they went home."},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"So how did they respond?"},"586":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, the kids loved the food."},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"They loved the better nutrition,"},"591":{"dur":1,"text":"and they loved not being hungry."},"594":{"dur":3,"text":"But Donna's biggest supporter\ncame from an unexpected place."},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"His name from Eric Parker,"},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"and he was the head football coach\nfor the Burke County Bears."},"605":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, Coach Parker had coached\nmediocre teams for years."},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"The Bears often ended\nin the middle of the pack --"},"611":{"dur":3,"text":"a big disappointment in one\nof the most passionate football states"},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"in the Union."},"616":{"dur":4,"text":"But the year Donna changed the menus,"},"621":{"dur":3,"text":"the Bears not only won their division,"},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"they went on to win\nthe state championship,"},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"beating the Peach County Trojans"},"629":{"dur":1,"text":"28-14."},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"(Laughter)"},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"And Coach Parker,"},"635":{"dur":3,"text":"he credited that championship\nto Donna Martin."},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"When we give our kids\nthe basic nourishment,"},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"they're going to thrive."},"646":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's not just\nup to the Cheryl Barbaras"},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"and the Donna Martins of the world."},"652":{"dur":1,"text":"It's on all of us."},"654":{"dur":4,"text":"And feeding our kids the basic nutrition\nis just the starting point."},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"What I've laid out is really a model"},"661":{"dur":3,"text":"for so many of the most pressing\nissues that we face."},"666":{"dur":5,"text":"If we focus on the simple goal\nof properly nourishing ourselves,"},"672":{"dur":3,"text":"we could see a world\nthat is more stable and secure;"},"676":{"dur":3,"text":"we could dramatically improve\nour economic productivity;"},"681":{"dur":2,"text":"we could transform our health care"},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"and we could go a long way"},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"in ensuring that the Earth can provide\nfor generations to come."},"689":{"dur":4,"text":"Food is that place\nwhere our collective efforts"},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"can have the greatest impact."},"697":{"dur":3,"text":"So we have to ask ourselves:\nWhat is the right question?"},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"What would happen"},"702":{"dur":5,"text":"if we fed ourselves more nutritious,\nmore sustainably grown food?"},"708":{"dur":1,"text":"What would be the impact?"},"711":{"dur":1,"text":"Cheryl Barbara,"},"713":{"dur":1,"text":"Donna Martin,"},"715":{"dur":2,"text":"Coach Parker and the Burke County
