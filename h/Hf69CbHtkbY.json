{"3":{"dur":5,"text":"My team, I'm personally based right here in\nLondon, is responsible for Android Wear which"},"8":{"dur":4,"text":"is our platform for wearables based on Google's\ncompute platform."},"13":{"dur":5,"text":"And we're really working very hard to bring\nall of that power to you wherever you are,"},"18":{"dur":3,"text":"because a wearable product is fundamentally\nalways right there."},"21":{"dur":4,"text":"You can glance at it and see useful information\nand you can use it to get things done as you"},"26":{"dur":1,"text":"move around the world."},"27":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, as we standard to decide what we wanted\nto do in this space, we thought really deeply"},"33":{"dur":4,"text":"and felt very strongly that if you look at\nwhat people wear, we all wear different clothes."},"38":{"dur":2,"text":"We all carry different accessories."},"40":{"dur":2,"text":"We all have a really individual sense of style."},"43":{"dur":4,"text":"And, therefore, we didn't think that a one-size-fits-all\nmodel, where we would build a product ourselves,"},"48":{"dur":2,"text":"would actually work for wearables."},"50":{"dur":6,"text":"So we set out to do everything I'm about to\nshow you in partnership with partners in this"},"57":{"dur":4,"text":"space that exist already, some of the electronics\ncompanies that we were working with for phones"},"61":{"dur":4,"text":"and tablets, but also a range of new partners\nfrom a watch industry."},"66":{"dur":3,"text":"People like Tag Heuer or Michael Kors or Nixon."},"69":{"dur":4,"text":"And we really fundamentally believe that we\ncan't make these experiences accessible to"},"74":{"dur":3,"text":"everyone out there in the world without those\nreally important partnerships."},"78":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's exciting to be able to do this in\ncollaboration with many people around the"},"81":{"dur":1,"text":"world."},"83":{"dur":5,"text":"And against that backdrop and what Behshad\nwas showing you is we do feel there's tremendous"},"89":{"dur":4,"text":"potential to actually assist people with this\nproduct that we're building."},"93":{"dur":1,"text":"So let's take a closer look."},"95":{"dur":5,"text":"If we switch to the demo here, you can see\nmy watch."},"100":{"dur":5,"text":"And what you're seeing here is the LG Watch\nSport which is a product from just one of"},"106":{"dur":1,"text":"our partners."},"107":{"dur":5,"text":"And all of the Assistant use cases that Behshad\njust demoed work here as well."},"112":{"dur":4,"text":"So one of the things I like to do with this\nwatch is take it for a run."},"116":{"dur":5,"text":"And these days, when I get home from the office,\nI want to make sure I'm running in daylight."},"121":{"dur":3,"text":"And, you know, it's the time of a year when\nthat's been changing so I can just go ahead"},"125":{"dur":5,"text":"and ask it questions like, \"What time is sunset?\""},"130":{"dur":3,"text":"And get those answers right here."},"134":{"dur":3,"text":"So lots of times, I go out directly for a\nrun."},"137":{"dur":5,"text":"And everything that Behshad has already showed\nyou works right here on your wrist."},"143":{"dur":3,"text":"We're also using the Assistant to actually\ncontrol the things that you can do."},"146":{"dur":4,"text":"Imagine if I was carrying a heavy bag of shopping\nor imagine I'm in the kitchen and I'm cooking"},"150":{"dur":5,"text":"and I want to set the timer, I can simply\nsay, \"Set a timer for ten minutes.\""},"156":{"dur":6,"text":"And while my hands have been busy, my watch\nis keeping track of that time."},"162":{"dur":3,"text":"And of course as I continue cooking I can\njust glance right down and see how much time"},"166":{"dur":2,"text":"is left on that timer."},"168":{"dur":4,"text":"So it's great to have those things available,\nbut some of the places where this is most"},"173":{"dur":5,"text":"useful is actually where the Assistant works\ntogether across devices to really help me."},"178":{"dur":5,"text":"So I have a Google Home in my kitchen, and\nI love to cook, and I use it a lot for doing"},"184":{"dur":3,"text":"things like setting timers or following recipes."},"187":{"dur":3,"text":"But I don't know about you, when I'm cooking\nthere are a few staple ingredients that I"},"190":{"dur":4,"text":"keep in my cupboards, like olive oil and so\nforth, and I always find that when I run out"},"195":{"dur":3,"text":"of one of those things, I forget to replenish\nit when I go shopping."},"198":{"dur":4,"text":"So now what I do is I say to my Google Home\n-- you won't see my watch respond here -- I"},"203":{"dur":3,"text":"say, \"Hey, Google, add soy sauce to my shopping\nlist.\""},"206":{"dur":5,"text":"And I've actually told the Google Assistant\nwhere my local -- where my local supermarket"},"212":{"dur":7,"text":"is so when I walk past or walk into the store,\nI automatically get a card just like this"},"219":{"dur":4,"text":"that appears, and it reminds me when I walk\ninto the local store that I told it that soy"},"223":{"dur":1,"text":"sauce is what I need to replenish."},"225":{"dur":4,"text":"And now I can cook a great Chinese dish the\nnext time I'm in the kitchen and not have"},"229":{"dur":3,"text":"a lack of that important ingredient."},"232":{"dur":7,"text":"So as we've refined Android Wear, what we\nfind is that there are common pieces of information"},"240":{"dur":3,"text":"that people were asking for from the Assistant\non the watch all the time."},"243":{"dur":3,"text":"Things like the weather or, I just showed\nyou, the time of sunset."},"247":{"dur":5,"text":"And we've actually worked hard to make any\nwatch face, no matter what its style is, to"},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"show people those kind of information."},"255":{"dur":4,"text":"So you can see right here I'm looking at the\nweather, which is something we see a lot of"},"260":{"dur":1,"text":"questions for."},"261":{"dur":4,"text":"But I can go ahead and long press on the watch\nface here and decide that maybe instead of"},"265":{"dur":6,"text":"seeing the battery, I would like to see the\ntime of sunrise and sunset."},"271":{"dur":3,"text":"And now when I go home, I'll be able to see\nif I've got time for that run without even"},"275":{"dur":1,"text":"having to ask a question."},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"And, in fact, this is something we've heard\na lot."},"278":{"dur":3,"text":"People have pieces of information that they\nask for habitually, and they actually vary"},"282":{"dur":1,"text":"a ton between people."},"284":{"dur":3,"text":"For instance I travel a lot between the States\nand the U.K., and one of the things I like"},"288":{"dur":3,"text":"to have on my watch face is the exchange rate\nfor those currencies, whereas for many other"},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"people that's not of particular interest."},"294":{"dur":5,"text":"So the ability to choose the information that\nmatters to you and have it available glanceably"},"299":{"dur":2,"text":"throughout the day is really, really valuable."},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"And in fact, that's kind of what watches are\nfor in the first place."},"304":{"dur":4,"text":"The reason we have time on our wrist is to\nhelp us make decisions as we go around our"},"308":{"dur":1,"text":"days."},"309":{"dur":3,"text":"I want to be able to look down and say maybe\nwe're getting towards the end of this meeting"},"313":{"dur":5,"text":"so I need to start bringing proceedings to\na close, or do I have time to grab a coffee"},"318":{"dur":1,"text":"before my next meeting."},"319":{"dur":4,"text":"So we really see bringing these pithy answers\ndirectly to your watch face as an evolution"},"324":{"dur":3,"text":"of what watches have always done for us."},"327":{"dur":8,"text":"But these products now embed not just screens\nand time keeping but also sensors."},"335":{"dur":4,"text":"And probably what gets me most excited working\nwith wearables, if we could switch back to"},"340":{"dur":8,"text":"the slides, is their potential to help all\nof us lead healthier and more active lives."},"348":{"dur":5,"text":"So all of these Android Wear watches embed\nthe kind of features that you would expect"},"353":{"dur":1,"text":"from a fitness tracker."},"355":{"dur":1,"text":"You can set goals."},"357":{"dur":4,"text":"You'll get notifications that help you stay\nmotivated to maybe work out a bit more through"},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"the day if you haven't been so active."},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"And they can also help you track workout sessions\nactively."},"366":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you were doing the spinning with Bradley\nWiggins, you'd be able to see just how hard"},"370":{"dur":3,"text":"you were working right on your wrist using\nsome of the sensors."},"374":{"dur":6,"text":"But with a screen and the ability to apply\nmachine learning to the data coming from those"},"380":{"dur":4,"text":"sensors, we're actually able to provide experiences\nthat go beyond just helping you track what"},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"you're doing and actually show you how to\nwork out."},"388":{"dur":4,"text":"So what you're seeing in this video that's\nabout to start playing behind me is a feature"},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"we built called Push-Up Challenges."},"395":{"dur":5,"text":"And if you have never done a push-up before,\nwe can use that big screen to teach you how"},"401":{"dur":4,"text":"to actually go about doing the exercise, how\nto keep the correct form."},"405":{"dur":3,"text":"And then when you actually start doing those\npress-ups -- which, I'm sorry, I'm not going"},"409":{"dur":5,"text":"to do right now -- we can actually analyze\nthe sensor data to see exactly how many you"},"414":{"dur":5,"text":"have done to help keep you using the correct\nform so that you're safe and having the most"},"420":{"dur":1,"text":"effective exercise."},"422":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, that's just one example of how we use\nsome of the sensors in these devices, but"},"427":{"dur":5,"text":"almost all smart watches these days are starting\nto include a heart-rate sensor."},"432":{"dur":6,"text":"And if we switch back to the demo here, I'd\nlove to show you something I'm pretty excited"},"439":{"dur":3,"text":"about that we can do with this in the future."},"443":{"dur":7,"text":"So this is the typical trace that you would\nsee from -- from the heart-rate sensor on"},"450":{"dur":1,"text":"the back of this watch."},"451":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is a trace that I'm showing you that's\ncome just from a piece of consumer hardware."},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact, it's the watch that I'm wearing on\nmy wrist right now."},"458":{"dur":5,"text":"And what these little peaks and troughs correspond\nto is the blood flow that's measured in my"},"463":{"dur":3,"text":"wrist by shining a light in and seeing how\nmuch light comes back."},"467":{"dur":4,"text":"And most products today take those peaks and\nsay look at how many of them there have been"},"472":{"dur":3,"text":"in a minute and give you your heart rate and\nbeats per minute."},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"And of course that's very interesting."},"477":{"dur":5,"text":"But if we take a closer look, there's actually\na ton more information right here."},"482":{"dur":5,"text":"So if I draw a line straight through all these\npeaks, that actually corresponds to respiration,"},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"how often I'm breathing."},"491":{"dur":6,"text":"And of course that can tell you a lot about\nhow -- how well or unwell I might be."},"497":{"dur":5,"text":"If we look at the difference between the time\nbetween these peaks, that gives you a measure"},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"of how variable my heart rate is."},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"Heart rate variability, which is a leading\nsign of health in general."},"508":{"dur":5,"text":"And finally this little notch that you can\nsee here is called the dicrotic notch and"},"513":{"dur":5,"text":"the time between the peak and that dicrotic\nnotch shows you how fast the blood is moving"},"519":{"dur":5,"text":"through my veins, and that is something that\ncan be directly correlated with heart -- with"},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"blood pressure."},"526":{"dur":1,"text":"So let's take a look at this."},"528":{"dur":6,"text":"We have, with this -- this is a Huawei watch,\nand this is a little demo that my team have"},"535":{"dur":1,"text":"built."},"536":{"dur":5,"text":"What you're seeing at the top is the signal\ncoming from that blood flow in my wrist."},"541":{"dur":4,"text":"You can see it's detecting where there are\npeaks and troughs."},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"And what's actually happening here is it's\nalso compensating for movement."},"549":{"dur":4,"text":"And eventually, when it gathers enough data,\nit will actually tell you not only what my"},"554":{"dur":3,"text":"heart rate is, which is 100 beats per minute."},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"I guess I'm a little bit stressed right now."},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"[ Laughter ]\nBut also how variable it is."},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"And, in fact, that's not great."},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"And at the top --\n[ Laughter ]"},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"I was a lot more relaxed in rehearsals."},"571":{"dur":3,"text":"[ Laughter ]\nAnd at the top you're also seeing the results"},"574":{"dur":4,"text":"of a machine learning model that is looking\nfor -- and we can go back to the slides -- is"},"578":{"dur":4,"text":"looking for and detecting arrhythmia in my\nheartbeat."},"582":{"dur":5,"text":"So it's amazing what we can do combining machine\nlearning with actual consumer commodity hardware."},"588":{"dur":4,"text":"And we're partnering closely both inside Google\nwith the Verily team -- we have a booth just"},"593":{"dur":3,"text":"outside and you can go and see more demos\nthere later -- and also with institutions"},"597":{"dur":7,"text":"around the world, within the NHS and Manchester\nin London, to be able to actually detect upcoming"},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"health conditions using these watches."},"608":{"dur":5,"text":"And when we can catch conditions early, they\ncan be treated much more effectively."},"614":{"dur":4,"text":"When we can give people that kind of coaching\nas they live their lives to help them stay"},"618":{"dur":4,"text":"with a course of prescribed exercise or medication\nor whatever, it makes their treatment much"},"623":{"dur":4,"text":"more effective and much more cost effective,\nand so I think there's tremendous potential"},"627":{"dur":4,"text":"here for the future and we're very excited\nto be working on it partnership with all of"},"632":{"dur":1,"text":"those folks I talked about at the beginning."},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you."}}
