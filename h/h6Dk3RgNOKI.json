thank you so much for joining us today\non \"Top of Mind.\""},"37":{"dur":1,"text":">> Well thanks, Thom."},"38":{"dur":1,"text":"Thanks for having me here."},"39":{"dur":2,"text":">> It's certainly our pleasure to have you\nhere."},"41":{"dur":6,"text":"Because, of course, you're a special part\nof the ecosystem here in Kansas City."},"47":{"dur":5,"text":"And I thought maybe we would kick things off\nby simply you sharing with \"Top of Mind\" viewers,"},"53":{"dur":5,"text":"you know, the history, what is Sourcelink,\nthe history and how it is we're sitting here"},"58":{"dur":1,"text":"today talking about it."},"59":{"dur":1,"text":">> Sure."},"60":{"dur":3,"text":"Sourcelink connects together networks of resources\nin regions across the country."},"64":{"dur":1,"text":"And these resources are entrepreneurs."},"66":{"dur":1,"text":"So you want to start and grow a business?"},"68":{"dur":3,"text":"We can get you to the right place at the right\ntime."},"71":{"dur":6,"text":"Sourcelink started, wow, back in 2003, ten\nyears ago, here in Kansas City through this"},"77":{"dur":2,"text":"thing we called KCSourcelink."},"80":{"dur":2,"text":"And we started it to solve a problem."},"83":{"dur":4,"text":"Lots of resources for entrepreneurs, the entrepreneur\ncouldn't find them no matter how hard they"},"87":{"dur":1,"text":"looked for them."},"88":{"dur":1,"text":"Or if they found one it was the wrong one."},"90":{"dur":4,"text":"So we needed to find the mechanism that would\nallow entrepreneurs to find the resources"},"95":{"dur":3,"text":"that they needed at the time they needed them\nto get something done."},"99":{"dur":2,"text":">> Well what kind of resources are we talking\nabout?"},"102":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, that's a pretty big and broad word."},"104":{"dur":1,"text":">> Uh huh."},"105":{"dur":2,"text":">> That can mean a lot of things especially\nat the community level."},"107":{"dur":1,"text":"What type resources are we talking about?"},"109":{"dur":3,"text":">> So resources that support entrepreneurs\nare wide and varied."},"112":{"dur":5,"text":"They can be financial resources, micro lending\nprograms, angel groups, venture capitalists"},"118":{"dur":7,"text":"who can help support the high growth entrepreneur,\nor they might be incubators or accelerators,"},"126":{"dur":1,"text":"places where you can go and grow your business."},"128":{"dur":4,"text":"It can also be small business development\ncenters where people will sit with you and"},"132":{"dur":5,"text":"do one on one counselling for whatever need\nthat you have or help you grow your business"},"137":{"dur":1,"text":"that way."},"138":{"dur":6,"text":"We have people that are paid to do this work\nfrom the government, the universities, and"},"144":{"dur":1,"text":"a lot of volunteers."},"145":{"dur":4,"text":"For instance, the Score organization is a\ngroup of volunteers that support small businesses."},"149":{"dur":4,"text":">> We were able to catch up with one of Sourcelink's\nfirst resource partners, Rick Miller, of the"},"154":{"dur":5,"text":"K State Extension to reminisce on some of\nthe early days of the organization."},"159":{"dur":3,"text":">> Community development means a lot of different\nthings, but we decided we wanted to offer"},"163":{"dur":6,"text":"some programming to startup business owners,\nbut didn't have a lot of resources at the"},"170":{"dur":2,"text":"university level."},"172":{"dur":4,"text":"That was about the time KCSourcelink was thinking\nabout coming together."},"177":{"dur":4,"text":"We attended some of their initial meetings\nand learned that this was really a way to"},"181":{"dur":6,"text":"bring all of the people in the metro area\ntogether who provide services for small business"},"188":{"dur":1,"text":"owners."},"189":{"dur":1,"text":"And we said we wanted to be a part of that."},"191":{"dur":5,"text":"And really, selfishly from two folks, one,\nfrom someone who didn't have a lot of small"},"196":{"dur":6,"text":"business background, by being part of Sourcelink,\nwe now were part of a network where we could"},"203":{"dur":4,"text":"be referred from many other business partners."},"207":{"dur":3,"text":"And all of sudden I didn't have to be the\nexpert anymore."},"210":{"dur":5,"text":"I could now simply plug people into Sourcelink\nso that if they needed business planning or"},"215":{"dur":6,"text":"finances or something else that I wasn't particularly\ngood with, Sourcelink was my answer."},"222":{"dur":1,"text":">> (Inaudible.)"},"223":{"dur":1,"text":">> Absolutely."},"224":{"dur":4,"text":"It was an easy way to refer people to the\nbest people who had information."},"228":{"dur":4,"text":">> So a lot of those support services and\nthose resources you just identified actually"},"233":{"dur":2,"text":"reside in different organizations?"},"235":{"dur":1,"text":">> Uh huh."},"236":{"dur":4,"text":">> So how did you, for lack of a better way\nto ask, how did you get them altogether and"},"240":{"dur":1,"text":"play nice so to speak?"},"242":{"dur":6,"text":">> So when we started looking at building\nthe ecosystem here in Kansas City we decided"},"248":{"dur":1,"text":"maybe we won't link together the entrepreneurs."},"250":{"dur":2,"text":"Lots of other people were trying to network\ntogether the entrepreneurs."},"253":{"dur":5,"text":"And we said instead, why don't we link together\nthe organizations that are supporting the"},"258":{"dur":1,"text":"entrepreneurs."},"259":{"dur":4,"text":"And so what we did, honestly, was we found\nabout 50 of them and got them in a room together"},"264":{"dur":2,"text":"and said, hey, we're here to help entrepreneurs\nfind you."},"267":{"dur":1,"text":"What can we do to help?"},"268":{"dur":1,"text":"And they told us five things."},"270":{"dur":3,"text":"They said one, make us visible, the entrepreneurs\ndon't know we exist."},"273":{"dur":1,"text":">> Fair enough."},"274":{"dur":4,"text":">> Most of our grantors don't give us money\nfor marketing so we're not very visible."},"279":{"dur":3,"text":"Secondly, they said, hey, we don't know what\neach other does."},"282":{"dur":2,"text":"We don't know if we're all doing the same\nthing."},"284":{"dur":3,"text":"We would like to make good client referrals\nto people that can help them but we don't"},"287":{"dur":1,"text":"know who each other are."},"289":{"dur":2,"text":"Can you help us figure that out."},"291":{"dur":4,"text":"The third thing they said is, we want to deliver\nthe programs that the entrepreneurs need."},"296":{"dur":3,"text":"Can you tell us where the gaps are in services\nto entrepreneurs."},"300":{"dur":2,"text":"The fourth was we need more money."},"302":{"dur":2,"text":"Can you help us raise money for our own organizations."},"305":{"dur":1,"text":">> That seems like a common goal."},"306":{"dur":1,"text":">> Yeah."},"307":{"dur":3,"text":"And the last one was can you help us measure\neconomic impact because the only way that"},"310":{"dur":5,"text":"we will raise additional funds is if we know\nthat we're making a difference in the community."},"315":{"dur":4,"text":"So those are the five tenants that we started\nour little network of entrepreneurial support"},"320":{"dur":1,"text":"organizations with."},"321":{"dur":4,"text":">> So would it be safe to say you, in essence,\ndid a gap analysis for the community"},"326":{"dur":2,"text":">> Uh huh.\n>> and said at least on, I think it was the"},"328":{"dur":4,"text":"fourth point you made, and said like this\nis where you all fit in the tapestry of what's"},"333":{"dur":1,"text":"happening in Kansas City?"},"335":{"dur":1,"text":">> Uh huh."},"336":{"dur":1,"text":">> That's that's really amazing."},"337":{"dur":4,"text":"Because in my travels and experiences I know\nlots of communities that would kill for such"},"342":{"dur":1,"text":"an organizing effort."},"343":{"dur":3,"text":"Perhaps, and I'm setting you up blatantly\nfor the next question here."},"347":{"dur":1,"text":">> Okay."},"348":{"dur":4,"text":">> Is that perhaps how or the motivation as\nto how Sourcelink or KCSourcelink went from"},"353":{"dur":2,"text":"Kansas City to now a national profile?"},"355":{"dur":1,"text":">> Right."},"356":{"dur":4,"text":"As we were building Sourcelink we created\ntools that would allow us to do it easily"},"361":{"dur":4,"text":"and to make our entrepreneurial support organization\nvisible to the community."},"365":{"dur":4,"text":"So that included things like a website, resource\nnavigator tool that allows you to answer some"},"369":{"dur":6,"text":"questions and find the resource that you need\nand the tool that we used to track business"},"376":{"dur":4,"text":"growth and development, which was the economic\nimpact piece."},"380":{"dur":7,"text":"And what we found was we had a turnkey system\nthat you could go into another community and"},"388":{"dur":4,"text":"say what are your resources and let's make\nthem visible and turn this on."},"392":{"dur":4,"text":"So it wasn't long before other communities\ncame and said, will you help us do this in"},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"our own community, we don't know what our\nassets are."},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"They're not working together that we know\nof."},"402":{"dur":3,"text":"And we don't know if we're helping entrepreneurs\nthe best way that we can."},"405":{"dur":2,"text":">> So how many cities are you in today?"},"408":{"dur":4,"text":">> I think we're in about 22 additional regions\nbeyond Kansas City."},"412":{"dur":1,"text":">> Wow."},"413":{"dur":6,"text":">> And the regions are as small as White Water,\nWisconsin and as large as the state of Alaska,"},"419":{"dur":6,"text":"Alaska Sourcelink; and big cities like Dallas."},"426":{"dur":1,"text":"Sourcelink is in Dallas."},"427":{"dur":7,"text":"And small cities like a region right around\nRochester, Minnesota, Southern Minnesota Sourcelink."},"434":{"dur":2,"text":">> I think you're going to San Antonio soon\ntoo, aren't you?"},"437":{"dur":1,"text":">> That's right."},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"We should be in San Antonio by this fall."},"439":{"dur":1,"text":">> That's pretty exciting."},"440":{"dur":1,"text":">> Uh huh."},"441":{"dur":4,"text":">> So as you go into these different markets,\nyou know, help me understand how you do the"},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"onboarding."},"446":{"dur":5,"text":"Does a team of your staff, you know, drop\nin, parachute into the city and then there's"},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"a protocol that they run?"},"453":{"dur":1,"text":">> Uh huh."},"454":{"dur":2,"text":">> You know, to get everybody to come and\nmeet and be seen?"},"457":{"dur":2,"text":">> We believe that entrepreneurialship is\nhyper local."},"459":{"dur":1,"text":"So we don't swoop in."},"461":{"dur":5,"text":"What we do is we find a champion in that location\nto help us build the entrepreneurial ecosystem"},"466":{"dur":1,"text":"through Sourcelink."},"467":{"dur":3,"text":"So we find a champion and we teach them how\nto do it."},"471":{"dur":1,"text":">> Oh really?"},"472":{"dur":3,"text":">> One of the things that we do first is go\nin and find out, find who the resources are"},"475":{"dur":1,"text":"and who their funders are."},"476":{"dur":3,"text":"And we start by bringing those, that group\ntogether to find out what their gaps are and"},"480":{"dur":3,"text":"what they need in their area and then we customize\nSourcelink to take them forward from that"},"484":{"dur":1,"text":"point."},"485":{"dur":3,"text":">> Maria, I was wondering if you could share\nwith me like an example of a program that"},"489":{"dur":6,"text":"Sourcelink offers that might be unique and\nin the sense it can serve a multitude of companies"},"495":{"dur":4,"text":"of different types of industries, you know,\nnot like specific high tech or, you know,"},"500":{"dur":1,"text":"consumers retail."},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, like what's been a program that\nyou've had some success with?"},"504":{"dur":1,"text":">> Sure."},"505":{"dur":1,"text":"Let me tell you about our Battle of the Brands\nproject."},"507":{"dur":4,"text":"You know, I told you we make our entrepreneurial\nresources visible."},"511":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, Battle of the Brands helps make some\nof our entrepreneurs visible."},"515":{"dur":5,"text":"We do every March we get together and we pit\n64 different companies against each other"},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"in our March Madness Type brackets."},"523":{"dur":3,"text":"And we use social media and people have to\nvote for them."},"527":{"dur":4,"text":"And they make it through brackets and at the\nend they win a pair of boxing gloves."},"531":{"dur":1,"text":"So it's Battle of the Brands."},"532":{"dur":3,"text":">> Now wait a minute, that seems like that\ncould be stacked."},"536":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean, there's got to be some, you know,\ncompanies in a given community that have much"},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"more kind of brand awareness in the community?"},"544":{"dur":4,"text":">> You'd certainly expect our technology companies\nto win this one hands down, right?"},"548":{"dur":1,"text":">> Right."},"549":{"dur":1,"text":">> Well guess what?"},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"It doesn't always come out that way."},"551":{"dur":3,"text":"This past year it was a plumbing company that\nwon."},"555":{"dur":4,"text":"And we had a lot of technology companies that\nsaid how did that plumbing company win."},"559":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, we found out from them that they learned\nan awful lot about how to make social media"},"564":{"dur":4,"text":"work by doing this project or by having people\nvote for them online."},"568":{"dur":6,"text":"And they built beat the likes of our highest\nlevel technology companies in this town to"},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"take over the winning spot."},"576":{"dur":4,"text":">> You know, I bet they probably didn't have\nquite as an appreciation for technology or"},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"social media before then."},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"Would that be a fair statement?"},"583":{"dur":1,"text":">> I think so."},"584":{"dur":5,"text":"And I think that interestingly enough in this\nlittle activity that we did, I think they"},"589":{"dur":3,"text":"raised the visibility of their company so\nhigh in the community that it really will"},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"change the way they do business in the future."},"594":{"dur":3,"text":">> We got to take a look at those boxing gloves\nfirsthand when we talked to Jeff Morgan of"},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"Morgan Miller Plumbing."},"599":{"dur":7,"text":">> Our marketing director, Tasha Everhart,\ngot us involved with KCSourcelink through"},"607":{"dur":3,"text":"a Battle of the Brands contest that they have."},"610":{"dur":4,"text":"We had been nominated as one of the companies\nin town to be in this contest."},"615":{"dur":4,"text":"And Tasha took it real seriously and said\nwe're going to get involved in this and we're"},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"going to push ourselves and see how far we\ncan go."},"621":{"dur":3,"text":">> Speaking of how far you could go and I'm\nguessing this is why we have boxing gloves"},"625":{"dur":4,"text":"here in front of us, this looks like the kind\nof thing you do for battle of something."},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"Was this part of what you took advantage of?"},"633":{"dur":3,"text":">> KCSourcelink is so we've learned so much\nin the last year from them."},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"It's just amazing."},"637":{"dur":2,"text":"I just can't believe that we didn't know them\nsooner."},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"And I wish we would have."},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"But they started this Battle of the Brands."},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"It's set up like the NCAA tournament."},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"There's 64 companies or teams."},"647":{"dur":4,"text":"There's four different brackets and you battle\neach team each week and get votes."},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"The one with the most votes move to the next\nround."},"655":{"dur":2,"text":">> These like Facebook votes?"},"657":{"dur":1,"text":">> Yeah."},"658":{"dur":1,"text":">> Yeah."},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"They got to go online."},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"And KCSourcelink was real smart, you didn't\nhave to register, you didn't have to give"},"663":{"dur":1,"text":"them any private information."},"664":{"dur":2,"text":"All you had to do was go vote and get off."},"667":{"dur":1,"text":">> Okay."},"668":{"dur":3,"text":">> A lot of people don't like to give their\nemail address and do that stuff."},"671":{"dur":1,"text":">> Right."},"672":{"dur":1,"text":">> They wouldn't have voted."},"673":{"dur":1,"text":"So they made it really easy."},"674":{"dur":5,"text":"First there's 64 and 32, then there's 16 and\n8 until there is one final team left."},"680":{"dur":2,"text":">> And you were the\n>> You're looking at them baby."},"682":{"dur":1,"text":">> No kidding."},"683":{"dur":2,"text":"So you won the whole tournament?"},"685":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm wondering if you were a bracket buster\nfor some of those earlier rounds?"},"688":{"dur":1,"text":">> I think we were."},"689":{"dur":4,"text":"The second round we had to go up against Boulevard\nBrewery, which everybody loves."},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"There's no way we're going to win, right?"},"696":{"dur":1,"text":">> Right."},"697":{"dur":2,"text":">> And we all laughed and were still asking\nfor people to vote for us anyway."},"699":{"dur":1,"text":"And by gosh, we won."},"701":{"dur":1,"text":">> Isn't that something."},"702":{"dur":2,"text":">> Then it was Gales Harley Davidson."},"704":{"dur":4,"text":">> Now Harley people and affiliates of Harley\nDavidson, they know a thing or two about marketing."},"709":{"dur":1,"text":">> They fought pretty hard against us."},"711":{"dur":4,"text":"But boy we just asked and asked and asked\nand asked and got online and asked."},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"That's what KCSourcelink taught us."},"716":{"dur":5,"text":"They told us it was okay to scream and yell\nabout who you are."},"722":{"dur":4,"text":">> I know we're coming up on a big milestone,\nyou know, the ten year Sourcelink anniversary."},"727":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, can you share with me like what\nthat journey has been like?"},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, what's it felt like over the last\nten years?"},"733":{"dur":1,"text":">> Wow."},"734":{"dur":3,"text":">> I know, it's a big question but\n>> I don't know that I would have thought"},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"we would have been where we are today ten\nyears ago."},"740":{"dur":2,"text":">> So what does that mean?"},"742":{"dur":4,"text":">> When I started Sourcelink it was a white\npiece of paper."},"746":{"dur":1,"text":"And they showed me my office."},"747":{"dur":3,"text":"It was a teacher's desk and 32 student desks."},"751":{"dur":4,"text":"I had no phone, no computer."},"755":{"dur":4,"text":"And somebody told me what we need you to do\nis hook entrepreneurs up to the resources"},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"that they need to grow."},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"So ten years ago that's where we started."},"764":{"dur":1,"text":"We had nothing."},"765":{"dur":3,"text":"And we had one year of funding."},"769":{"dur":5,"text":"And desired to make something that was going\nto last and be here longer than that one year"},"775":{"dur":1,"text":"of funding."},"776":{"dur":4,"text":"So right from the beginning we knew that we\nneeded to create something that was scaleable."},"780":{"dur":5,"text":"That we needed to think about building something\nthat would work for other people."},"786":{"dur":6,"text":"And that's how we would make it sustainable\nand impactful for the country, for our community"},"792":{"dur":1,"text":"and the country."},"794":{"dur":5,"text":"And we actually wrote a business plan within\na year of starting Sourcelink, a real live"},"799":{"dur":1,"text":"business plan."},"801":{"dur":6,"text":"And with our products laid out and our revenue\nstreams laid out and built a three year business"},"808":{"dur":1,"text":"plan."},"809":{"dur":1,"text":">> You still have a copy of that plan?"},"810":{"dur":1,"text":">> I do have a copy of that plan."},"811":{"dur":4,"text":"And the funny thing is, I think it's the first\nbusiness plan I've ever written that actually"},"816":{"dur":1,"text":"came true."},"817":{"dur":1,"text":">> Really?"},"818":{"dur":1,"text":">> Yeah."},"819":{"dur":3,"text":"We actually followed pretty much the steps\nthat were in the plans."},"822":{"dur":4,"text":"The only difference was we expanded about\neight months earlier than we thought we would."},"826":{"dur":1,"text":">> Oh, but that's a happy problem, right?"},"828":{"dur":1,"text":">> That's right."},"829":{"dur":1,"text":"That's right."},"830":{"dur":3,"text":">> I'm sure there were market conditions that\ngave you confidence for that expansion."},"833":{"dur":4,"text":"Speaking of that expansion, so here we are\nat the, you know, the ten year mark, 22 cities."},"837":{"dur":4,"text":"Now I'm going to ask you the bigger question,\nright?"},"842":{"dur":1,"text":"What's in store for the next ten years?"},"844":{"dur":1,"text":">> For the next ten years?"},"845":{"dur":4,"text":"One of the things that we built over the last\nten years is probably America's most accurate"},"850":{"dur":2,"text":"database of resources."},"853":{"dur":7,"text":"And we have found that it's very difficult\nto keep those resources accurate."},"860":{"dur":5,"text":"And we've determined a way to do that by working\nwith our affiliates across the country."},"866":{"dur":4,"text":"So what we would like to have happen is to\npartner with people who need those resources"},"871":{"dur":3,"text":"and let us be their curators of those resources."},"874":{"dur":2,"text":"And we should see Sourcelink resources all\nover the place."},"877":{"dur":7,"text":"You know, my dream would be the Federal Government\nwebsite is showing the resources that we pull"},"884":{"dur":1,"text":"together."},"886":{"dur":3,"text":"And the all of our local websites that want\nto point out entrepreneurial resources would"},"889":{"dur":2,"text":"be pointing to our resource database."},"892":{"dur":3,"text":">> Sort of like a Sourcelink.gov some day?"},"895":{"dur":1,"text":">> Yeah."},"896":{"dur":6,"text":"So that's certainly an asset that we have\nthat we could really take advantage of."},"902":{"dur":5,"text":"Another asset that we have is this very strong\nnetwork of people across the country that"},"907":{"dur":6,"text":"are working in a variety of different environments,\na variety of different economies with different"},"913":{"dur":1,"text":"industries."},"914":{"dur":4,"text":"And we have access to best practices in each\none of those groups."},"919":{"dur":4,"text":"So to be able to share those practices amongst\nlots of people would be a dream."},"923":{"dur":1,"text":">> Like a playbook so to speak?"},"924":{"dur":1,"text":">> Yeah."},"925":{"dur":5,"text":">> Do you find, do you find much demand beyond\njust kind of the network effect and what you"},"930":{"dur":4,"text":"do when you go into all of these other communities,\ndo you find additional demand, like okay,"},"935":{"dur":4,"text":"Maria, your team and you did so well here,\nhere's another conundrum we've been dealing"},"939":{"dur":1,"text":"with."},"940":{"dur":4,"text":"And do you get asked to look at kind of like\nadditional services to provide?"},"945":{"dur":1,"text":">> We do."},"946":{"dur":1,"text":"We do."},"947":{"dur":1,"text":">> I would think you might."},"948":{"dur":1,"text":">> Yeah."},"949":{"dur":3,"text":"And I think we've done it many times now in\nmany different communities."},"953":{"dur":6,"text":"And originally we were, you know, we did consulting\nto help people figure out what to do in their"},"960":{"dur":4,"text":"community and then help them support it through\ntools, tool development."},"964":{"dur":4,"text":"But we've gotten to the point now where we\nknow a lot about resources and communities"},"968":{"dur":5,"text":"and entrepreneurship and could actually go\nin, I think, and really help develop an entrepreneurial"},"974":{"dur":4,"text":"ecosystem within a particular region at a\nmuch deeper level than we do now."},"979":{"dur":4,"text":">> I'm thinking on the ten years that you've\nseen and all the help that you're providing"},"984":{"dur":4,"text":"for entrepreneurs all the over the country,\nso I have to ask kind of as an I don't know,"},"989":{"dur":1,"text":"kind of like a closing thought\n>> Uh huh."},"990":{"dur":1,"text":">> Do you consider yourself an entrepreneur?"},"992":{"dur":1,"text":">> I do."},"993":{"dur":6,"text":"I think that it's difficult to keep something\ngoing for ten years without using some entrepreneurial"},"1000":{"dur":2,"text":"techniques to make that happen."},"1003":{"dur":2,"text":"We sit inside of a university."},"1006":{"dur":1,"text":"That's where the program is."},"1007":{"dur":1,"text":"But we raise our own funds."},"1008":{"dur":1,"text":"We make our own investments."},"1010":{"dur":4,"text":"We determine our own future and we drive forward\nthat way."},"1015":{"dur":6,"text":"There have been days when
