supposed to just kind of give people ideas\nabout what to eat as part of a healthy diet,"},"40":{"dur":2,"text":"as is the USDA's MyPlate."},"42":{"dur":3,"text":"But there's quite a big difference between\nthe recommendations made by these two institutions."},"46":{"dur":6,"text":"The USDA food guide is a little bit less specific\nin terms of its recommendations,"},"52":{"dur":4,"text":"their MyPlate system recommends dairy as the\nbeverage of choice,"},"57":{"dur":6,"text":"and also includes red meat and processed meat\nin its healthy protein category,"},"63":{"dur":3,"text":"as long as it is low in sodium and low in\nfat."},"67":{"dur":4,"text":"And so the focus of the MyPlate is primarily\non low-fat foods,"},"71":{"dur":1,"text":"and things like that."},"72":{"dur":3,"text":"But less focus is made on the latest medical\nrecommendations."},"76":{"dur":2,"text":"And as Harvard so kindly puts it,"},"78":{"dur":5,"text":"\"USDA's MyPlate still doesn't offer the most\ncomplete picture when it comes to basic nutrition"},"84":{"dur":1,"text":"advice.\""},"85":{"dur":6,"text":"So, Harvard has \"burned\" the USDA MyPlate\nfor not really having a complete picture

public"},"99":{"dur":1,"text":"health,"},"100":{"dur":2,"text":"that they may not have the best information\non public health,"},"102":{"dur":4,"text":"because they are, for a large part, the United\nStates' largest food lobby."},"107":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, one of the interesting things about these\ntwo organizations"},"110":{"dur":5,"text":"is that Harvard's School of Public Health\nis a non-profit organization devoted to health"},"115":{"dur":2,"text":"and the latest in medical science,"},"117":{"dur":3,"text":"the USDA is the US Department of Agriculture,"},"120":{"dur":4,"text":"and their job is to guide Americans on healthy\neating habits,"},"125":{"dur":3,"text":"but also to promote agricultural products."},"128":{"dur":4,"text":"And sometimes those two mandates come into\nconflict."},"132":{"dur":4,"text":"Harvard's School of Public Health explains\nthe absence of dairy in their recommendations"},"136":{"dur":5,"text":"by telling readers that they have found that\nthere are increased risks of ovarian cancer"},"142":{"dur":4,"text":"and prostate cancer among people who drink\nlarge amounts of milk,"},"146":{"dur":7,"text":"and that there's also little or no evidence\nthat dairy consumption helps prevent osteoporosis."},"153":{"dur":5,"text":"Which goes completely against everything that\nwe've always heard all over our lives."},"159":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's quite confusing when you consider\nthat the World Health Organization also doesn't"},"163":{"dur":3,"text":"even mention dairy in its recommendations\nfor a healthy lifestyle,"},"167":{"dur":4,"text":"that the USDA still puts such a high emphasis\non it."},"171":{"dur":2,"text":"Dairy is considered to be an amazing source\nof protein,"},"174":{"dur":3,"text":"low fat dairy is supposed to be a wonderful\nsource of calcium,"},"177":{"dur":3,"text":"and they want you to eat three or four servings\nper day."},"180":{"dur":2,"text":"They encourage that children drink milk,"},"183":{"dur":2,"text":"they even have programmes to help put milk\nin schools,"},"185":{"dur":4,"text":"so that they can add more dairy consumption\nto our diets."},"190":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's very interesting, because, as Harvard\npoints out,"},"194":{"dur":3,"text":"this is something that is influenced by industry\nlobbyists."},"197":{"dur":4,"text":"And again, this is one of those points where\nthe interests of consumers run up against"},"202":{"dur":2,"text":"the interests of food industry lobbyists,"},"205":{"dur":4,"text":"who obviously have great sway within the Department\nof Agriculture."},"209":{"dur":2,"text":"It's interesting to me that the USDA's food\npyramid,"},"212":{"dur":1,"text":"and now the MyPlate system,"},"213":{"dur":4,"text":"are considered one of the best places to turn\nto in terms of dietary advice,"},"218":{"dur":5,"text":"when, in fact, they have been pretty backwards\non this whole thing for a very long time."},"223":{"dur":2,"text":"If you have kids, this may frustrate you even\nmore."},"226":{"dur":1,"text":"It certainly frustrates me."},"227":{"dur":3,"text":"Because children are taught in school that\nthey need to drink three or four servings"},"230":{"dur":1,"text":"of dairy per day,"},"232":{"dur":3,"text":"or face the consequences of poor health and\ncrumbling bones."},"235":{"dur":4,"text":"And this is also pushed on women, that they\nneed to drink much more milk,"},"240":{"dur":1,"text":"because otherwise their bones will crumble,"},"241":{"dur":5,"text":"that osteoporosis is directly the result of\nconsuming other beverages besides milk,"},"247":{"dur":6,"text":"and that somehow if you drink milk, then you'll\nbe able to prevent osteoporosis."},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"As is the case with a lot of industry propoganda,"},"255":{"dur":1,"text":"this just simply isn't true."},"257":{"dur":1,"text":"And it doesn't reflect"},"258":{"dur":1,"text":"the latest in medical science."},"259":{"dur":2,"text":"It's understandable that many years ago,"},"261":{"dur":2,"text":"people would have thought that milk would\nmake your bones strong,"},"264":{"dur":2,"text":"but after years and years of scientific studies,"},"267":{"dur":4,"text":"we haven't gotten any closer to understanding\nthat milk in any way prevents osteoporosis."},"271":{"dur":4,"text":"It remains kind of a hypothesis that we have\nheld up as true,"},"275":{"dur":1,"text":"for so long that people have forgotten"},"277":{"dur":3,"text":"that there really is not very much evidence\nto support it."},"281":{"dur":3,"text":"My grandmother, who is now 87 years old, as\nI have told you guys before,"},"285":{"dur":3,"text":"she consumed 3 glasses of milk per day"},"288":{"dur":1,"text":"her entire life."},"289":{"dur":1,"text":"And she was always really good about it."},"291":{"dur":4,"text":"When we went to her house she always made\nsure we had milk with every meal."},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"And it was something that she really though\nwas important,"},"297":{"dur":3,"text":"because she was schooled in food and nutrition\nscience, that's what her degree was in."},"301":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, that was something very important\nto her,"},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"to encourage people to drink milk."},"306":{"dur":5,"text":"And yet, today, she has broken a hip, she's\nhad problems with her knees,"},"311":{"dur":5,"text":"and some issues with osteopenia, and also\nhas had cancer."},"317":{"dur":2,"text":"And, I don't know if those things are connected,"},"319":{"dur":3,"text":"that's obviously an anecdotal piece of evidence,"},"323":{"dur":6,"text":"but the fact that she has weak bones seems\nto me fairly strong evidence that large consumption"},"329":{"dur":1,"text":"of dairy products,"},"330":{"dur":5,"text":"at least in my family, for my genes, doesn't\nnecessarily provide defence against osteoporosis."},"336":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, what does provide defence against osteoporosis?"},"340":{"dur":2,"text":"What actually does make your bones stronger?"},"342":{"dur":3,"text":"And the answer is, green leafy vegetables,"},"345":{"dur":3,"text":"and also calcium fortified products, like\nsoy milk."},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"And I think this is really interesting,"},"351":{"dur":3,"text":"given the fact that I just made a video a\nfew weeks ago"},"354":{"dur":5,"text":"about how the dairy industry wants to prevent\ncompanies from being able to call soy milk"},"360":{"dur":1,"text":"\"milk.\""},"361":{"dur":2,"text":"Because they say that it does not contain\nthe same nutrients that are in milk."},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"And, I guess that's true."},"366":{"dur":1,"text":"It doesn't have the same nutrients."},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"It doesn't have cholesterol."},"368":{"dur":1,"text":"It doesn't have a lot of the negative things."},"370":{"dur":3,"text":"It doesn't contain lactose that many people\ncan't process."},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"It doesn't have any of those things."},"376":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's just fascinating to me that this\nindustry"},"379":{"dur":3,"text":"is so concerned about non-dairy milks."},"383":{"dur":3,"text":"And when you start seeing the recommendations\nfrom scientists,"},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"you start realizing why."},"388":{"dur":4,"text":"And the answer is that it has become fairly\nevident that after you have been weaned,"},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"you don't any longer require mammalian milk."},"395":{"dur":4,"text":"And you probably never required the milk of\nlarge ruminants,"},"399":{"dur":2,"text":"at any point in your life, since you are not"},"402":{"dur":1,"text":"- I assume if you're watching this -"},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"a large ruminant."},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"So, if you are a human being, you probably\nneeded"},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"human breast milk at some point in your life,"},"410":{"dur":4,"text":"and after that point you were fine with pretty\nmuch any fortified beverage that contains"},"414":{"dur":1,"text":"calcium,"},"415":{"dur":4,"text":"or eating a diet that's extremely rich in\ndark, leafy greens and things like that."},"419":{"dur":5,"text":"It makes a lot more sense just to drink either\na beverage that's fortified with calcium,"},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"or just to eat a healthy diet with plenty\nof greens."},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"And, according to Harvard's School of Public\nHealth,"},"430":{"dur":4,"text":"you don't even necessarily need fortified\nvegan products, either."},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"You could probably do just fine with a nice\nhealthy diet."},"437":{"dur":4,"text":"Personally, I do like to eat fortified products,\njust because"},"441":{"dur":4,"text":"I guess, like my grandmother, I'm still fairly\nparanoid that I'm going to have weak bones."},"445":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, I like to drink those products just\nbecause I like not having to worry so much"},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"about osteoporosis."},"452":{"dur":1,"text":"That may be overkill on my part."},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"But I do try to make sure I get a certain\namount of calcium per day."},"456":{"dur":2,"text":"Around 1300 mg or something like that,"},"459":{"dur":2,"text":"I believe is the recommendation for an adult\nfemale,"},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"1200-1300, something like that."},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's a fairly high amount."},"466":{"dur":1,"text":"And if you were drinking milk,"},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"you'd be drinking 4 glasses of milk to try\nand reach that amount."},"471":{"dur":3,"text":"And of course, again, because we don't know\nhow much of that milk would actually...the"},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"calcium would actually get into your bones,"},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"it may not be that helpful for you."},"479":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, I don't think the USDA wants your bones\nto crumble,"},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm sure that they mean quite well,"},"484":{"dur":4,"text":"but I also think that they've ignored medical\nscience for a long time."},"489":{"dur":4,"text":"I wonder sometimes when we hear about the\nnegative effects of dairy products,"},"493":{"dur":5,"text":"if dairy and red meat and processed meat are\ngoing to become like cigarettes were."},"498":{"dur":3,"text":"Where cigarette companies were allowed for\nso long to say that,"},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"cigarettes might even be good for your health."},"504":{"dur":4,"text":"You know, to smoke the same brand that your\ndoctor smokes,"},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"because that's better for your health."},"510":{"dur":5,"text":"And, it's disappointing that dairy has taken\nso much longer for consumers to learn about."},"516":{"dur":6,"text":"If dairy really is as negative as the Harvard\nSchool of Public Health says that it may be,"},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"it's somewhat concerning that it's taken us\nso long"},"525":{"dur":1,"text":"in order to address this issue."},"527":{"dur":4,"text":"And, I think it's just - it's really helpful\nto hear from the medical consensus that this"},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"actually is a very healthy diet."},"534":{"dur":3,"text":"That drinking milk is not only not necessary\nfor good health,"},"538":{"dur":3,"text":"it may, in fact, actually be bad for your\nhealth."},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, I hope this actually just is an encouraging\nreminder"},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"that you're doing the right thing if you're\nalready vegan."},"548":{"dur":4,"text":"And if you're not vegan, and you feel that\ndairy products are important for your health,"},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"please go to the Harvard School of Public\nHealth,"},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"and take a look at some of this information."},"556":{"dur":1,"text":"It just might change your mind,"},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"and might make you feel much more comfortable\nabout"},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"switching to a plant-based diet."},"561":{"dur":3,"text":"I know that it certainly is comforting to\nme to see"},"565":{"dur":3,"text":"that scientific consensus is on the side of\nplant-based diets."},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"As sad as it may be, the dairy farmers are\nprobably not"},"572":{"dur":4,"text":"the ones who should be telling you how much\ndairy you should consume each day."},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"The same goes for beef producers."},"579":{"dur":1,"text":"Likely,"},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"they're going to want you to consume beef."},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"Just as the dairy farmers are going to want\nyou to eat dairy."},"584":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'm sure the soy lobby wants you to drink\nsoy milk."},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"That's why we need to have objective outside\nvoices,"},"590":{"dur":1,"text":"as much as possible."},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"And turn to them for the information."},"594":{"dur":4,"text":"And I appreciate that the USDA is trying,\nI think,"},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"maybe to help people to eat a healthier diet,"},"601":{"dur":5,"text":"but it is sad to see that they still haven't\nremoved recommendations to eat red and processed"},"606":{"dur":1,"text":"meat,"},"607":{"dur":1,"text":"that they've not made any guidelines on that,"},"609":{"dur":4,"text":"that they're still recommending three or four\nservings of dairy products per day."},"613":{"dur":3,"text":"The USDA's recommendations don't reflect current\nresearch,"},"616":{"dur":5,"text":"and they also reflect an industry bias that\nI don't think is
