background"},"402":{"dur":6,"text":"just here, and the sunflower is doing its\nbit; it\u2019s turning towards the light."},"409":{"dur":8,"text":"So I think you can, kind of, see the importance\nof

1632 by Charles I and pointing\nout the sunflower, which many people have"},"431":{"dur":2,"text":"suggested is the king himself."},"434":{"dur":4,"text":"So he\u2019s turning towards the flower, the\nflower is turning towards him."},"438":{"dur":4,"text":"Some people suggested it might be his admiration\nfor art itself."},"442":{"dur":9,"text":"But, again, you can see so many paintings,\nif you delve, use the sunflower as a symbol."},"451":{"dur":6,"text":"But it wasn\u2019t just affection."},"458":{"dur":6,"text":"It was\u00d6 remember van Gogh, of course, was\na pastor\u2019s son and

who\u2019s\nhad\u00d6 gone through that experience must be"},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"in some ways marked by it."},"523":{"dur":7,"text":"And, of course, his dead brother had the same\nname as him, which I think to English people"},"530":{"dur":6,"text":"is surprising, but remember that Salvador\nDali had exactly the same experience."},"537":{"dur":7,"text":"His experience was worse because the

his father\u2019s bible."},"574":{"dur":7,"text":"And then you have a candle that\u2019s been blown\nout and another book, which turns out to be"},"581":{"dur":3,"text":"Emile Zola\u2019s Joie de

here you have, if you like, the old, which\nis being rejected by Van Gogh, and the new,"},"597":{"dur":6,"text":"the modern novel, and then the candle, which\nis a very familiar symbol."},"604":{"dur":5,"text":"And if you go to the Van Gogh Museum you can\nsee the original bible, which was eventually"},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"found at Leiden."},"612":{"dur":4,"text":"And you can see his copy of the Emile Zola."},"617":{"dur":6,"text":"And so we have, in a way, the modern novel,\nthe outdated bible."},"623":{"dur":6,"text":"And you lovers of this gallery will be familiar\nwith the idea of the vanitas."},"630":{"dur":4,"text":"Here\u2019s a typical one with Steenwijk."},"634":{"dur":7,"text":"So here you have, of course, the skull, which\ngives the game away; once we\u2019re gone, nothing"},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"we can do about it."},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"We should have said our prayers earlier on."},"645":{"dur":5,"text":"But you have lots of objects that are repeated\nagain and again."},"651":{"dur":1,"text":"We had a candle blown out."},"652":{"dur":5,"text":"Here we have a lamp that\u2019s just gone out."},"657":{"dur":5,"text":"A shell here, which once had a living animal\nin it."},"663":{"dur":6,"text":"We have a clock, or rather a watch that\u2019s\npossibly stopped in time; music that\u2019s stopped."},"669":{"dur":7,"text":"We have books, etc, etc, and we have lots\nof exotic objects, which of course in life"},"677":{"dur":7,"text":"we would be proud of but in death we can\u2019t\ntake away."},"685":{"dur":4,"text":"So I think you can see that painting is very\nmuch in the vanitas tradition."},"689":{"dur":7,"text":"And the reason they had the vanitas tradition,\nof course, the Dutch were largely Calvinists"},"697":{"dur":10,"text":"so the church had no decorations, so religious\nideas crept into paintings, mainly still lives."},"707":{"dur":7,"text":"This is a church tower that whilst Van Gogh\u00eds\nparents were living there at Neunen, was gradually"},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"being dismantled."},"716":{"dur":7,"text":"So he has painted it several times with the\nspire, and the last painting is all the bricks,"},"724":{"dur":7,"text":"the stones, what have you, bits of wood being\nsold off, and for him it was symbolic."},"732":{"dur":9,"text":"He felt quite strongly that the church itself\nwas falling apart."},"742":{"dur":5,"text":"I should say that going back to the bible,\nkind of, it\u2019s interesting that its spine"},"747":{"dur":4,"text":"was cracked, and if you see it today in the\nVan Gogh Museum it\u2019s always opened in the"},"751":{"dur":10,"text":"same place as in the painting, which his Isaiah\n53."},"761":{"dur":13,"text":"So it was at this time that he felt really\nquite strongly that he could no longer accept"},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"the teachings of the conventional church."},"779":{"dur":5,"text":"He said, I can\u2019t paint cathedrals anymore,\npeople are much more interesting."},"784":{"dur":3,"text":"I feel the church is mouldering away."},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"He still had this religious passion."},"790":{"dur":5,"text":"He still wanted to emulate his father, and\nas you know, he went on to preach in various"},"795":{"dur":4,"text":"places, including, incredibly, Isleworth."},"799":{"dur":7,"text":"So this, for him, was the end of the conventional\nchurch, which never really supported him,"},"807":{"dur":6,"text":"because when he was working near Mons in the\nBorinage with the miners, he identified with"},"813":{"dur":4,"text":"the miners, sleeping on straw in this little\nhut that\u2019s still there."},"818":{"dur":6,"text":"And, of course, the church authorities were\nappalled and promptly sacked him."},"825":{"dur":7,"text":"So if we look at the Sunflowers, you\u2019ll\nnotice that there are flowers in various stages"},"832":{"dur":2,"text":"of growth."},"835":{"dur":7,"text":"Down here, a young bud, and clearly this one\nis beginning to die off, and finally the seed"},"842":{"dur":1,"text":"heads."},"843":{"dur":2,"text":"So we have a, kind of, lifecycle."},"846":{"dur":5,"text":"This in itself is a vanitas and if you go\nround the National Gallery you\u2019ll see some"},"852":{"dur":7,"text":"flower pieces that are not just there to represent\nflowers in all their glory, particularly tulips,"},"859":{"dur":3,"text":"but they\u2019re often suggestive of the shortness\nof life."},"862":{"dur":3,"text":"You\u2019ll often see the odd butterfly, the\nsnail."},"865":{"dur":7,"text":"The snail is symbolic because the snail actually\nfeeds off dead flowers, what have you."},"873":{"dur":4,"text":"And this painting, which is in a private collection,\nmakes it fairly clear."},"878":{"dur":8,"text":"The combination of the skull and the usual\nsymbols, for instance, here is one we haven\u2019t"},"886":{"dur":1,"text":"come across yet."},"887":{"dur":8,"text":"This is a shell with bubbly water in it, soapy\nwater, and a straw, and the idea is you blow"},"896":{"dur":4,"text":"a bubble and the bubble symbolises the shortness\nof life."},"900":{"dur":4,"text":"Quite often you see Dutch children blowing\nthese bubbles."},"905":{"dur":7,"text":"Music, again, music survives but the music\ngives out at some point."},"912":{"dur":2,"text":"Sometimes you see an hourglass."},"915":{"dur":4,"text":"You have the skull but, interestingly enough,\nyou notice around the skull there\u2019s some"},"919":{"dur":1,"text":"straw."},"920":{"dur":5,"text":"What that symbolises, in death we\u00d6 well death\nis democratic."},"925":{"dur":7,"text":"This person may well have been very famous\nand a worn laurel wreaths for poetry, for"},"932":{"dur":6,"text":"art, athletics perhaps, but in death it turns\nto straw, so the message is pretty clear."},"939":{"dur":5,"text":"But, again,

here."},"967":{"dur":5,"text":"Whether Van Gogh actually knew these emblems\nis difficult to say but they were still around"},"972":{"dur":5,"text":"in the 19th century but that, kind of, whole\nidea, and of course people talking about Christ"},"977":{"dur":3,"text":"as the light of the world was commonplace."},"981":{"dur":4,"text":"What is interesting is what he\u2019s actually\ndone whilst he\u2019s copying."},"985":{"dur":8,"text":"He was a great, great copier and if you think\nabout it he was, in a way, self-taught."},"994":{"dur":3,"text":"He went to the academy in Antwerp, fell out\nwith the teachers."},"997":{"dur":6,"text":"He went to Cormon\u2019s academy in Paris, fell\nout with the teachers."},"1004":{"dur":4,"text":"You can imagine, they wanted him to follow\nthe academic pattern of drawing from plaster"},"1008":{"dur":4,"text":"cast, etc, so he wasn\u2019t going to do that."},"1013":{"dur":4,"text":"So all of his life he copied, right to the\nend of his
