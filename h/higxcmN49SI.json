aging."},"138":{"dur":1,"text":"So, I think that's what it is."},"140":{"dur":2,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nAnd it seems like we're going back to an earlier"},"142":{"dur":6,"text":"time where mom and dad would move back in\nwith the adult children, and you just had"},"148":{"dur":2,"text":"this larger extended family."},"150":{"dur":4,"text":"Which actually can have some benefits, or\nsome good things

people"},"214":{"dur":3,"text":"when they're considering doing caregiving\nin their home?"},"218":{"dur":3,"text":"What are some things people need to think\nabout before they really launch into this?"},"221":{"dur":1,"text":">>Cheri Burcham:\nDive in, okay."},"223":{"dur":6,"text":"Well, one thing they really need to consider\nis, you know, whether they're emotionally"},"229":{"dur":1,"text":"ready to do this."},"231":{"dur":1,"text":"Some people, they feel obligated."},"233":{"dur":4,"text":"And I say if it's just obligation, you really\nneed to rethink."},"238":{"dur":4,"text":"Because, you know, considerations are your\nschedule."},"242":{"dur":6,"text":"I mean, are you really going, realistically\ngoing to be able to take care of them and"},"248":{"dur":1,"text":"put dinner on the table, you know?"},"250":{"dur":1,"text":"Can you give up work?"},"251":{"dur":3,"text":"Is it something that, you know, that's an\nissue?"},"255":{"dur":4,"text":"You need to consider what, you know, all of\nthe practical things like will they be living"},"259":{"dur":1,"text":"in their home."},"260":{"dur":3,"text":"Is that something you can do is come and help\nthem there?"},"263":{"dur":8,"text":"Or are they moving into yours, and is your\nhome set up for them?"},"271":{"dur":4,"text":"You just have to be, you have to really try\nto take the feelings out of it and be more"},"276":{"dur":2,"text":"realistic about can this be done."},"279":{"dur":3,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nSo, how should, on the flip side of that,"},"282":{"dur":6,"text":"how should someone approach maybe their parent\nabout the need for maybe mom or dad, we think"},"289":{"dur":1,"text":"you need more care."},"290":{"dur":1,"text":"Because, that is a sensitive subject."},"291":{"dur":2,"text":">>Cheri Burcham:\nIt is."},"293":{"dur":4,"text":"It's very sensitive because you get some older\nadults that, they're very independent."},"298":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, everybody, that's your main thing\nis your independence."},"301":{"dur":6,"text":"And they, like you said, it's very sensitive."},"307":{"dur":4,"text":"I think the best way to approach it is, you\nknow, look, mom and dad."},"311":{"dur":5,"text":"I want you to be able to live on your own\nas long as possible, and to have that happen,"},"317":{"dur":3,"text":"this and this and this has to be done, you\nknow."},"320":{"dur":4,"text":"Because, if it ins't, then we're looking at\nnursing home care, or assisted living, and"},"324":{"dur":1,"text":"that."},"325":{"dur":3,"text":"And most older adults want more than anything\nto just be in their own home."},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"That's where they're comfortable, that's where\nthey're used to."},"332":{"dur":6,"text":"So, I think that just to make it very important\nand up front to them that for this to happen,"},"338":{"dur":1,"text":"we have to set up this care."},"340":{"dur":4,"text":"And get them, and to get them talking about\nit as early as possible."},"345":{"dur":3,"text":"It's really hard to get them to talk about\nit before they need it."},"349":{"dur":6,"text":"And so, I also have lessons with older adults\nthemselves, encouraging them to have those"},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"conversations with their kids."},"358":{"dur":5,"text":"Because, they just don't think, like you wouldn't\nthink about what would you need for care,"},"363":{"dur":1,"text":"i mean, at this point."},"364":{"dur":5,"text":"And they're kind of the same way.\nand so, we have to have those lines of communication"},"369":{"dur":1,"text":"open to talk about it."},"371":{"dur":3,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nAre there certain signs that people are, you"},"374":{"dur":5,"text":"know, like kids should look out for as they're\nlooking at mom and dad aging?"},"380":{"dur":4,"text":"You know, maybe indicators that, you know,\nmaybe it's time they may need some additional"},"385":{"dur":1,"text":"care."},"386":{"dur":3,"text":">>Cheri Burcham:\nCertainly, you know, their mobility is a

also."},"399":{"dur":2,"text":"Kind of watching those types of things."},"401":{"dur":5,"text":"And are they making mistakes in their financial\nbusiness?"},"407":{"dur":5,"text":"You know, is the bank calling, saying, you\nknow, mom's bouncing checks now, what's going"},"412":{"dur":1,"text":"on with that?"},"414":{"dur":3,"text":"Just kind of keeping tabs on them that way."},"417":{"dur":7,"text":"And if you see any discrepancies or any things\nthat are unusual for them, you know, maybe"},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"then kind of..."},"426":{"dur":5,"text":"Sometimes, you can get a case manager in to\nkind of assess and see, you know, and maybe"},"431":{"dur":1,"text":"give you a better idea."},"432":{"dur":3,"text":"Sometimes, bringing in someone from outside\nis a very good thing."},"436":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nI was going to say, sometimes an outsider"},"438":{"dur":6,"text":"can actually be helpful than, you know, the\nchild bringing this up to mom or dad."},"444":{"dur":3,"text":">>Cheri Burcham:\nYeah because, you know, even though you're"},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"an adult and responsible, you're always going\nto be their child."},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"So, it's hard sometimes coming from you."},"453":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, if you get that third party \"professional\"\nperson to come in."},"457":{"dur":3,"text":"And not, you know, just to say, look, mom\nand dad."},"460":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm going to have them come in and see if\nthere's any help that we can get."},"464":{"dur":4,"text":"They do the assessment, and it does, coming\nfrom them, they're going to listen, I think,"},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"a little more."},"470":{"dur":3,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nWhat recommendations do you have if someone"},"473":{"dur":3,"text":"decides to move mom or dad into their home?"},"477":{"dur":5,"text":"You spoke earlier about maybe needing to do\nan assessment of your home to make sure it's"},"482":{"dur":4,"text":"a good environment for someone who is elderly."},"487":{"dur":3,"text":"What sort of things should they consider about\nhaving to make changes in their home?"},"491":{"dur":5,"text":">>Cheri Burcham:\nWell, if you're moving them into yours, probably"},"496":{"dur":5,"text":"first and foremost, and this isn't even a\npractical issue, but if you have children,"},"501":{"dur":8,"text":"you know, you have to consider, okay what\nare the older person's, what are their ailments?"},"510":{"dur":4,"text":"You know, is it a mental issue, is it physical?"},"514":{"dur":5,"text":"And you know, how is that going to place burden\nor an inconvenience on the other members of"},"520":{"dur":1,"text":"the family."},"521":{"dur":1,"text":"That's one thing."},"522":{"dur":5,"text":"You know, we think about the practical things\nlike, okay, are your doorways wide enough."},"527":{"dur":4,"text":"Okay, get rid of the throw rug so they don't\nfall, make sure everything's visible so they"},"531":{"dur":1,"text":"don't trip on things."},"533":{"dur":5,"text":"Railing and, you know, in the bathroom, and\nthings such as that."},"539":{"dur":6,"text":"But I think it's even more important to consider\neverybody's comfort level, and is there room,"},"545":{"dur":4,"text":"and is it going to cause a disruption or an\nissue in the family."},"550":{"dur":2,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nAnd do you recommend that this is a family"},"552":{"dur":3,"text":"decision, especially if there are children\nin the home?"},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"That the whole family gets in and talks about\nthis?"},"557":{"dur":3,"text":"What do you think about having grandma come\nand live with us permanently?"},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"Because, that does have an effect on everybody."},"562":{"dur":2,"text":">>Cheri Burcham:\nYeah, I do think, I think that any time you"},"564":{"dur":9,"text":"give a person a say in the decision making,\nwhether it's a child or, I definitely, you"},"574":{"dur":4,"text":"must include the care receiver, the older\nadult themselves."},"578":{"dur":3,"text":"Planning around them is such a bad idea."},"582":{"dur":1,"text":"That they need to be involved in that."},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe they don't want to come there, you know?"},"586":{"dur":5,"text":"And so, getting everybody's say in this situation."},"591":{"dur":5,"text":"Even if, in the end, they're not, you're not\ngoing to be able to honor that or whatever,"},"597":{"dur":3,"text":"at least they feel like they've had a part\nin that decision making process."},"600":{"dur":3,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nSo, as you've talked to people who are going"},"603":{"dur":4,"text":"through this, what do they say are the most\ncommon challenges that they face about caregiving?"},"608":{"dur":4,"text":">>Cheri Burcham:\nYou know, there are so many for a caregiver."},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"There can be, anyway."},"614":{"dur":6,"text":"There can be depending on how much care you're\nreally asked to provide, and how often."},"621":{"dur":6,"text":"Definitely one that comes up a lot is the\nrespite and the break time."},"627":{"dur":5,"text":"Because, if you have someone that's having\nto give, you know, 24\/7 care, you know, and"},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"they're looking for a break."},"635":{"dur":5,"text":"And it can be hard to find resources out there\nto, you know, give them time off to do some"},"640":{"dur":1,"text":"things they need to do."},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"There are just so many challenges."},"644":{"dur":4,"text":"I have this thing that I, the domino effect\nis what's it's called."},"649":{"dur":4,"text":"And a big challenge, I think the biggest challenge\nfor caregivers, especially, you know, if they're"},"654":{"dur":4,"text":"related, if it's their parents or someone\nthey're close to, is all of the difficult"},"659":{"dur":4,"text":"feelings that they have with the situation."},"663":{"dur":3,"text":"And when I do my sessions with people, I talk\nabout this domino effect."},"667":{"dur":3,"text":"And I say, you know, there's a whole lot of\nthings to consider."},"671":{"dur":5,"text":"You know, what if, you know, you're having\nfeelings of resentment because you don't want"},"676":{"dur":3,"text":"to have to be put in this place, and you're\nmissing out on things, but you're doing it"},"680":{"dur":1,"text":"because you're helping."},"681":{"dur":6,"text":"And you know, what if you have to quit your\njob because you can't afford for someone to"},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"come in."},"688":{"dur":5,"text":"It's got to be you, so you've given up that\nidentify, that job that you're doing."},"693":{"dur":6,"text":"You know, what if the care receiver is not\nvery cooperative?"},"700":{"dur":4,"text":"You know, sometimes they're not overly cooperative\nor overly happy that you're, you know, helping"},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"them."},"705":{"dur":4,"text":"And maybe the doctors, maybe you're having\ntrouble getting through with the doctors."},"710":{"dur":5,"text":"Oh gosh, you know, maybe Medicaid, Medicare,\nall that healthcare stuff."},"715":{"dur":4,"text":"That's a whole other job, you know, trying\nto get through the paperwork and things like"},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"that."},"721":{"dur":4,"text":"Maybe you're having trouble just physically\nmaneuvering them and getting them where they"},"726":{"dur":4,"text":"need to be, and it's getting more difficult."},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, maybe your family isn't helpful."},"733":{"dur":5,"text":"Maybe you have siblings, and this can happen,\nthat they're available, but they're not."},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, they're here, but they're not hands\non."},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"So, you've got all these things lined up."},"743":{"dur":3,"text":"And maybe you can handle those things as they\ngo."},"746":{"dur":4,"text":"But then, one little things, extra little\nthing happens, and it's just, you've burnt"},"751":{"dur":4,"text":"out, you know, burn out and stress, and yeah."},"755":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's, and you just feel like you want\nto throw it all out."},"757":{"dur":3,"text":"So, that, I think, is the biggest challenge."},"761":{"dur":6,"text":"A lot of those, all those things and those\nfeelings of, you know, you're angry about"},"768":{"dur":6,"text":"your situation, you're fearful because you\ndon't know what to expect from day to day"},"774":{"dur":6,"text":"and, you know, and you feel guilty, too, because\nyou got angry and because you feel like it"},"781":{"dur":1,"text":"shouldn't be this way."},"782":{"dur":1,"text":"I should be happy to do this for them."},"784":{"dur":1,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nYou mentioned siblings."},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"So, maybe you're the caregiver."},"788":{"dur":3,"text":"Dad is living with you, and you have a sibling\nor two."},"791":{"dur":6,"text":"How should one bring those into the mix, especially\nif you have an expectation that they should"},"797":{"dur":1,"text":"also be helping with this."},"799":{"dur":1,"text":"How do you address that?"},"800":{"dur":3,"text":"Because, that's a whole other communication\nchallenge sometimes."},"804":{"dur":2,"text":">>Cheri Burcham:\nWell, that's when, at the very beginning when"},"807":{"dur":3,"text":"we talked about that whole can you realistically\ndo this."},"810":{"dur":4,"text":"When you're considering it, that's when you\nshould be bringing in the whole family, the"},"815":{"dur":4,"text":"people that you think might be pitching in\nbecause they should, because they're right"},"819":{"dur":1,"text":"there."},"820":{"dur":3,"text":"And you're putting them there and asking,\nwhat can you do?"},"824":{"dur":4,"text":"Because, you know, we can't assume."},"828":{"dur":5,"text":"We can't assume that the sister's going to\nhelp, and this one's going to take him for"},"834":{"dur":1,"text":"the weekends and, you know."},"835":{"dur":1,"text":"You have to get it down."},"837":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay, I want to know because we're considering\ndoing this care."},"841":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, does it happen where they say they're\ngoing to help, and they don't?"},"845":{"dur":2,"text":"Yes, you know, yes."},"847":{"dur":3,"text":"And there's one of those frustrations, you\nknow, that that happens"},"850":{"dur":5,"text":"And we can't ever force them to do what they're\nnot going to do."},"855":{"dur":6,"text":"So, but to ask, because sometimes I think\nthat, I've heard caregivers in the past say,"},"861":{"dur":1,"text":"well they won't do this, and they won't do\nthat."},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"And I say, well did you ask them?"},"865":{"dur":3,"text":"Well no, but they should, they should know\nbetter."},"869":{"dur":4,"text":"And it's like, but sometimes people don't,\nsometimes they're standing on the sideline"},"873":{"dur":2,"text":"thinking, well maybe you don't want help."},"876":{"dur":2,"text":"So, they just need that ask."},"879":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, maybe they will tell you no."},"882":{"dur":1,"text":"At least you can know."},"883":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean, you can't know until you ask and say,\nlook, this would be so helpful to me if you"},"888":{"dur":2,"text":"did this this and this, you know."},"891":{"dur":2,"text":"It would help me care for mom better if you\nwould."},"893":{"dur":2,"text":">>Lori Casey:\nWell, and have you found that if it's the"},"895":{"dur":4,"text":"person giving the care, that maybe the sibling\nthinks, well they're kind of in in charge"},"900":{"dur":1,"text":"of this?"},"901":{"dur":2,"text":"I shouldn't really say anything."},"904":{"dur":4,"text":"Or as you said, it seems like a lot of it\nis assumptions getting us in trouble."},"908":{"dur":2,"text":">>Cheri Burcham:\nYeah, that communication."},"911":{"dur":4,"text":"Communication I can't emphasize more at this\npoint in their lives."},"915":{"dur":2,"text":"To keep it open."},"918":{"dur":5,"text":"And that's with those siblings, that's with\nthe care receiver, that's with the doctors"},"924":{"dur":1,"text":"and the healthcare professionals."},"926":{"dur":6,"text":"That you have to have a transparent thing\ngoing on, and to speak very clearly about"},"932":{"dur":9,"text":"what you want and what you need, and to listen,\nyou know, very carefully about, you know,"},"941":{"dur":6,"text":"listen to what they're saying, and to go ahead\nand, that third thing mostly is defining like,"},"948":{"dur":1,"text":"making sure that you heard correctly."},"949":{"dur":3,"text":"And you've probably heard this in other, with\ncommunication."},"952":{"dur":6,"text":"It's, okay, am I hearing you say that you\ncan't take care of mom on the weekends?"},"959":{"dur":3,"text":"Or you know, is this what I'm hearing you\nsay?"},"962":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, and clarifying those things."},"964":{"dur":3,"text":"So, it just, yeah, you can't assume."},"967":{"dur":1,"text":"[laughs]\n>>Lori Casey:"},"968":{"dur":4,"text":"So, you had talked about when the dominoes\nall fall, we're in stress mode."},"972":{"dur":5,"text":"What sort of things, advice can you give if\nsomeone's out there

that\nstress?"},"986":{"dur":6,"text":">>Cheri Burcham:\nFor one thing, if someone is caregiving, and"},"993":{"dur":4,"text":"they haven't met with a caregiver advisor."},"998":{"dur":4,"text":"And i know you've had her on the show before\nfrom this county, but every county in Illinois"},"1002":{"dur":6,"text":"has a caregiver advisor designated by the\nDepartment on Aging."},"1009":{"dur":7,"text":"And they are a wonderful resource to be able\nto hook you up to respite care and in-home"},"1016":{"dur":2,"text":"care, like to come in and supplement."},"1018":{"dur":5,"text":"That's one thing they're, especially if it's\na spouse taking care of, you know, a person"},"1024":{"dur":4,"text":"taking care of their spouse, a lot of times\nthat situation they feel like they have to"},"1028":{"dur":5,"text":"be the only one and do it all, because it's\ntheir duty."},"1034":{"dur":4,"text":"And sometimes it can be hard to convince them."},"1038":{"dur":5,"text":"It's like, you can accept their help; you\nneed to take a break."},"1043":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's the biggest thing with caregivers\nis, that's the last thing on their list is"},"1048":{"dur":2,"text":"to take care of themselves."},"1050":{"dur":3,"text":"And then, you see that whole burnout crisis\nthing."},"1053":{"dur":7,"text":"So, my advice would be to contact a caregiver\nadvisor, see what's out there, see what additional"},"1061":{"dur":2,"text":"resources can help you."},"1063":{"dur":3,"text":"Definitely step away and take a break."},"1067":{"dur":5,"text":"And even, and it doesn't mean that it has\nto be a vacation, even though that would be"},"1072":{"dur":1,"text":"nice."},"1073":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, if, especially if they're doing\n24\/7 care."},"1077":{"dur":7,"text":"But like, you know, going out for walks, going\nto meet with friends."},"1084":{"dur":6,"text":"Because, so many times they sever all

hospice\nor hospital care?"},"1131":{"dur":4,"text":">>Cheri Burcham:\nI think a big one, one that I notice more"},"1136":{"dur":4,"text":"is just the physical ability to handle a person."},"1140":{"dur":6,"text":"I think that's when a lot of them, if they\nhave a physical impairment, and it gets to"},"1147":{"dur":4,"text":"the point where, I don't care if you're only\na hundred pounds."},"1152":{"dur":6,"text":"If you're not able to get up on your own or\nhelp, assist getting up, it's very difficult"},"1158":{"dur":1,"text":"for someone to lift
