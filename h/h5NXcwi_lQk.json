you?"},"127":{"dur":1,"text":">>Dr. Sally Foote:\nIt can be."},"129":{"dur":5,"text":"The first thing is that, whether or not it's\ngood to bring your pet is, you know, how long"},"134":{"dur":2,"text":"are you going to travel for?"},"136":{"dur":3,"text":"What route: are you taking a plane, or are\nyou, you know, traveling by car?"},"140":{"dur":5,"text":"And how well does your pet do in those kind\nof travel ways?"},"145":{"dur":1,"text":"And then, where are you going to?"},"147":{"dur":1,"text":"Are you going to be staying in a hotel?"},"149":{"dur":3,"text":"Are you going to be staying in a family's\nhome, and does that other family\u2019s home"},"153":{"dur":3,"text":"have another pet themselves, and how well\ndo those pets get

Runyon:\nAnd a lot of times, we just think of ourselves"},"165":{"dur":1,"text":"first and foremost."},"167":{"dur":4,"text":"And our dogs and cats sometimes come second,\nwhich they shouldn't."},"171":{"dur":3,"text":"But let's, you mentioned car, so let's start\nwith car travel."},"174":{"dur":4,"text":"How can you acclimate your dog or cat to long\ncar rides?"},"178":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, it's something that, you shouldn't\njust open up the car door and plop them in."},"182":{"dur":1,"text":">>Dr. Sally Foote:\nRight."},"183":{"dur":4,"text":"So, the first thing is if you have a puppy\nor a kitten, you want to take them on a lot"},"188":{"dur":1,"text":"of car rides."},"189":{"dur":3,"text":"And you want to set up that car ride to be\nsafe for the pet and safe for you."},"192":{"dur":4,"text":"So, what that means is yes, get that puppy\none of those like safety harnesses that hooks"},"197":{"dur":3,"text":"to your safety belt in the backseat of the\ncar."},"201":{"dur":2,"text":"Enforce that the dog should, puppy should\nstay in the backseat of the car."},"203":{"dur":1,"text":"And you make it nice for them."},"205":{"dur":4,"text":"You may have like a couple treats you pass\nback there so they, and when I say treats,"},"210":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm talking like this for Ranger."},"211":{"dur":3,"text":"We took one, and we broke it up into tiny\nlittle pieces because we don't want them to"},"215":{"dur":2,"text":"eat a lot of food that, they may get sick\non that."},"218":{"dur":1,"text":"But you're going to make it fun, and you're\ngoing to do fun trips."},"220":{"dur":2,"text":"You're going to put them in the car when you\ngo to the bank."},"222":{"dur":1,"text":"You're going to go to the post office."},"224":{"dur":3,"text":"And just these trips, so it's not always to\nthe vet, because if you only take them in"},"228":{"dur":4,"text":"the car to the vet, then they associate things\nlike, oh my gosh, I'm getting a shot, or maybe"},"232":{"dur":3,"text":"they were sick and they were painful, and\nthey remember that about the car."},"236":{"dur":1,"text":"And that\u2019s why they don't like the car."},"238":{"dur":2,"text":"So, setting it up to be nice as a puppy."},"240":{"dur":4,"text":"If you already have an adult pet, and if they\ndon't like riding in the car, then there are"},"245":{"dur":1,"text":"ways that you can..."},"247":{"dur":1,"text":"First of all, taking short trips."},"249":{"dur":3,"text":"Second of all, use some products that can\ndecrease their anxiety about getting in the"},"253":{"dur":1,"text":"car and riding in the car."},"254":{"dur":4,"text":"I think carriers like the regular, you know,\nhard shell case, like carriers, are really"},"259":{"dur":4,"text":"good for small dogs and cats to travel in,\nbecause if you ever get in a car accident"},"264":{"dur":1,"text":"it will protect your pet."},"265":{"dur":4,"text":"And I've seen that happen because I'm near\nthe Pesotum State Police, you know, office"},"269":{"dur":4,"text":"there in Tuscola, where there have been major\naccidents on the interstates."},"274":{"dur":3,"text":"And the dog was say, loose in the car, you\nknow, not secured in any way or anything,"},"278":{"dur":3,"text":"and they took off out of the car and they\nwere lost."},"281":{"dur":3,"text":"Or the animal got injured badly because they\nwere thrown in the car, as well."},"285":{"dur":4,"text":"So, these are things we don't always think\nabout, but it is really important, you know,"},"289":{"dur":2,"text":"because we want to think about pet safety."},"291":{"dur":4,"text":"And lastly, we don't want, like, the cat that\ngets under the brake pedal."},"296":{"dur":3,"text":"I've heard those stories, you know, as your\ndriving in the car."},"299":{"dur":3,"text":"Or the dog who now is sitting right here in\nyour lap, you know, as you're driving with"},"303":{"dur":5,"text":"the steering wheel, and might be licking on\nyour face, etc., distracting you as a driver."},"308":{"dur":1,"text":"I see a lot of that."},"309":{"dur":1,"text":">>Kelly Runyon:\nI see a lot of that."},"310":{"dur":3,"text":">>Dr. Sally Foote:\nBut that is not safe, and you're training"},"313":{"dur":3,"text":"the dog to allow to lay like that, you see."},"317":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, that's not, you can train the dog\nto be happy laying in the seat next to you,"},"322":{"dur":1,"text":"secured, like I said, to the safety belt."},"323":{"dur":4,"text":"Or you can train the dog to be happy in its\ncarrier in the car."},"327":{"dur":1,"text":"They're not going to feel unloved."},"329":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's like your kids in the car seats,\nright?"},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"You're safe and sound, I'm safe and sound."},"335":{"dur":1,"text":"My mind's on driving."},"336":{"dur":3,"text":"Play time will come when we get to the park,\nor we get where we're going."},"340":{"dur":2,"text":">>Kelly Runyon:\nWell, let's say you do all of that, but your"},"343":{"dur":1,"text":"animal still is anxious."},"344":{"dur":6,"text":"Are sedatives, is that something that you\nwould say is an okay thing, or maybe not so"},"351":{"dur":1,"text":"much?"},"352":{"dur":4,"text":">>Dr. Sally Foote:\nEverything, like how a pet learns how to be"},"357":{"dur":4,"text":"what they associate with say, riding the car,\nis all related to how do they feel."},"362":{"dur":4,"text":"So, if they're really anxious, and they won't\nbecome less anxious say, with something like"},"366":{"dur":3,"text":"a treat, then they're anxious enough, yes,\nthey do need help."},"370":{"dur":6,"text":"And where sedatives, you have to get them,\nif they're panting, pacing, say, vomiting,"},"376":{"dur":3,"text":"howling or yowling, that's a very highly anxious\nstate."},"380":{"dur":4,"text":"So yes, you do need to talk to your veterinarian\nabout a sedative or sedative combination to"},"384":{"dur":1,"text":"give them for travel."},"386":{"dur":3,"text":"Because, what's happening in their body is,\nit's just like you and me, their heart rate"},"389":{"dur":2,"text":"is racing, their intestinal tract is churning."},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"I have seen pets overheat because of the pacing\nand the panting."},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"So yes, sedatives are good."},"398":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, if we're working on say, training them\na little bit for the big trip, really helping"},"403":{"dur":5,"text":"them learn to kind of like the car, we can\nuse besides or instead of sedatives, we can"},"409":{"dur":2,"text":"use some anti-anxiety medication."},"411":{"dur":7,"text":"Or they do have products like, this is an\nactual calming supplement that can be given."},"419":{"dur":5,"text":"And it's actually an amino acid kind of combination\nwith a milk calming protein in it as a treat."},"425":{"dur":3,"text":"And you can give this to your dog or your\ncat like an hour before you start driving"},"429":{"dur":3,"text":"in the car for like those short trips, to\nhelp them learn to like it."},"432":{"dur":5,"text":"Lastly, you can use products like, this is\na pheromone spray for dogs, and there's one"},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"here for cats somewhere in my little goody\nbag."},"440":{"dur":1,"text":">>Kelly Runyon:\nCan't forget your goody bag."},"442":{"dur":1,"text":">>Dr. Sally Foote:\nYeah."},"443":{"dur":6,"text":"Okay, so the specific dog appeasing pheromone\nis very good for the dogs, and the facial"},"449":{"dur":5,"text":"pheromone product that, I can't really name\ntrade names here on PBS, but anyway, these"},"454":{"dur":1,"text":"are the best ones."},"456":{"dur":5,"text":"Lavender has also been shown to help dogs\nsettle a lot during travel, so now the, like,"},"461":{"dur":1,"text":"diffusors you can put in your car."},"463":{"dur":3,"text":"We do not want to give that to them by mouth,\nwe do not want to apply it to their skin."},"466":{"dur":1,"text":"That's too strong."},"467":{"dur":1,"text":"But that can be helpful."},"469":{"dur":4,"text":"And lastly, even like the compression thunder\nshirt can help some of these..."},"473":{"dur":2,"text":"That works, that can work for some pets."},"476":{"dur":5,"text":"So yes, if I have a really anxious pet, and\nyou're going to drive to Tennessee, you know,"},"481":{"dur":3,"text":"you've got an 8-hour drive ahead of you, this\nhappens, or you're moving down to Florida"},"484":{"dur":4,"text":"or something, much better that, as I say,\nmake them drunk and happy."},"488":{"dur":3,"text":"[chuckling]\nYou've got a long ride in front of you."},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"They're going to breathe okay, they can still\ngo to the bathroom when they need to."},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"You can still walk them around at the rest\nstop."},"496":{"dur":1,"text":"But they're just going to sleep."},"498":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's much better for them than being anxious\nand pacing."},"501":{"dur":3,"text":">>Kelly Runyon:\nYou brought a necessity bag with you today"},"505":{"dur":2,"text":"for Ranger, who's taking a little snooze."},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"I guess we're boring him."},"508":{"dur":1,"text":">>Dr. Sally Foote:\nWake up, buddy."},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"Everybody wants to see you."},"511":{"dur":3,"text":">>Kelly Runyon:\nBut speaking of necessity, we should all pack,"},"514":{"dur":6,"text":"just like we pack our bags for our trip as\nhumans, we need a necessity bag for our pets."},"521":{"dur":1,"text":"What should we pack?"},"522":{"dur":2,"text":">>Dr. Sally Foote:\nWell, if your pet is going to be, whether"},"525":{"dur":4,"text":"your pet is boarding somewhere or your pet\nis, you know, you're traveling with your pet,"},"529":{"dur":4,"text":"but especially if you're traveling with your\npet, you should bring their own food, and"},"533":{"dur":3,"text":"bring enough to last for your whole trip,\nplus maybe a little bit extra."},"537":{"dur":4,"text":"Because, what happens if your car breaks down\nor you have a delay in your trip, you know?"},"541":{"dur":7,"text":"And especially if your pet is on any kind\nof special diet, because prescription diets,"},"548":{"dur":3,"text":"you know, a veterinarian in a different state\nmay not be able to sell that to you if you"},"552":{"dur":4,"text":"run out because of our state laws, with prescription\nlaws."},"556":{"dur":4,"text":"Or they may not be able to call the clinic\nto get that prescription, you know, for some"},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"of these really specialty diets."},"562":{"dur":1,"text":"So, bring plenty on your trip."},"564":{"dur":3,"text":"You're better to bring too much than possibly\nnot enough."},"567":{"dur":6,"text":"So, food, their own like bedding or some kind\nof bedding thing at home, like a little blanket"},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"or something."},"574":{"dur":5,"text":"I like it when clients have one of these,\nsorry where are you, here you go."},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"This is like a pet folder."},"581":{"dur":4,"text":"So, in this we have all the vaccination record,\nand there's even a pocket in there that you"},"586":{"dur":5,"text":"could put say, the list of medications your\npet is on, and it would have your veterinarian's"},"591":{"dur":2,"text":"name and phone number, etc. on there."},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"All pets need to wear an identification collar."},"596":{"dur":5,"text":"They have to have a collar or harness on that\nhas your home phone number."},"601":{"dur":4,"text":"I would put your cell phone number on this\nbecause when you're traveling, everybody's"},"605":{"dur":1,"text":"got their cell phones."},"607":{"dur":5,"text":"And if your pet slips away from you somehow\nor in some way, and this happens, then if"},"613":{"dur":3,"text":"somebody finds the pet or he ends up at the\nshelter, they can call you and, you know,"},"617":{"dur":1,"text":"help you get your pet back with you."},"618":{"dur":2,"text":">>Kelly Runyon:\nIs it possible to get records from your vet's"},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"office to also stick in this little folder\npacket?"},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"To make copies and have that with you?"},"625":{"dur":1,"text":">>Dr. Sally Foote:\nSure."},"626":{"dur":3,"text":"Most veterinary clinics are computerized,\nso they can quickly print off like a summary"},"630":{"dur":5,"text":"of say, vaccination or what the health problems\nare, maybe even medications."},"636":{"dur":6,"text":"And all veterinary clinics will do that, you\nknow, for you as just a free service or whatever,"},"642":{"dur":1,"text":"you know, for your pet."},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think it's essential, it's important."},"645":{"dur":3,"text":">>Kelly Runyon:\nWe've talked a lot about car, but now let's"},"649":{"dur":4,"text":"switch over to some important reminders if\nyou have to travel by air."},"653":{"dur":4,"text":"And that can be scary for a pet owner, knowing\nthat, I mean some airlines the pet can be"},"657":{"dur":1,"text":"with you, but in some cases not."},"659":{"dur":1,"text":">>Dr. Sally Foote:\nRight."},"661":{"dur":6,"text":"So, first of all, most of the small pets,\ndog or cat, under about 15 pounds or so, if"},"667":{"dur":5,"text":"they can fit in the carrier that can go underneath,\nyou know, the airline seat in front of you,"},"673":{"dur":2,"text":"then they can travel in the cabin with you."},"675":{"dur":4,"text":"And that tends to be actually the best way\nfor the pet to travel because they can see"},"679":{"dur":2,"text":"you, you can see them, and so forth."},"682":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, some bigger pets or, depending on your\non a smaller airplane, they'll have to go"},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"into cargo."},"688":{"dur":4,"text":"Call plenty in advance to find out what the\nrules and regulations are for your pets to"},"693":{"dur":1,"text":"travel in cargo."},"695":{"dur":4,"text":"Because, they cannot allow pets to travel\nwhen the air temperature is too cold outside"},"700":{"dur":6,"text":"or in-flight, or too hot outside or in-flight,\nor if the length of time of the flight is"},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"too long."},"708":{"dur":4,"text":"They may require that your pet have sedation\nbecause this prevents a lot of pets from getting"},"713":{"dur":3,"text":"upset in the carriers and trying to escape."},"716":{"dur":7,"text":"And there are some, and there are some airlines\nthat might offer some additional services"},"724":{"dur":5,"text":"for the pet, like they may, if you're having\nto do a connecting flight, you know, that"},"729":{"dur":3,"text":"they've got an area for relief for the pets,\nlike to take the dogs out."},"732":{"dur":3,"text":"And they might offer, and I don't know the\nparticular airlines, but I've just heard of"},"736":{"dur":4,"text":"this, they might offer to like, allow your\npet out to relieve themselves and back in,"},"740":{"dur":1,"text":"and some might not."},"741":{"dur":4,"text":"So, you need to call and gather all this information\nup, you know, ahead of time."},"746":{"dur":2,"text":">>Kelly Runyon:\nHave you talked to some of your clients that"},"749":{"dur":4,"text":"have flown with animals, and maybe the stress\nthat it causes?"},"753":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean, what are some of the things that could\nhappen if, you know, if they're on a plane?"},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean, anxiety I suppose is one thing."},"760":{"dur":1,"text":">>Dr. Sally Foote:\nRight."},"761":{"dur":5,"text":"So, because they have to be in a carrier,\nthey have to be in some kind of containment,"},"766":{"dur":4,"text":"you really have to be sure that this dog or\ncat likes being in there, not that they just"},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"tolerate it."},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"Because, there's going to be noise, you know,\non the plane a little bit, there's going to"},"774":{"dur":1,"text":"be other people."},"775":{"dur":3,"text":"You can't take your pet out like this, like\nRanger, and just hold them in your lap."},"778":{"dur":1,"text":"They're not going to allow that."},"780":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, you know, like a cat like Ranger would\nhave to be used to going in a carrier and"},"784":{"dur":1,"text":"laying there, and be like okay, this is fine."},"786":{"dur":1,"text":">>Kelly Runyon:\nWhich he is."},"787":{"dur":1,"text":">>Dr. Sally Foote:\nYeah, I know he is because he travels a lot,"},"789":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's the point."},"790":{"dur":3,"text":"So, at home what you do is, you not only have\nthat carrier out in the home, but you feed"},"794":{"dur":1,"text":"your cat in that carrier."},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"The food doesn't go elsewhere in the kitchen\nand other places."},"798":{"dur":1,"text":"You put it in the carrier."},"799":{"dur":4,"text":"And you make games of like toss, and same\nthing for your dog, you toss the food in the"},"804":{"dur":3,"text":"carrier, and then you practice shutting the\ndoor so that they're in the carrier closed"},"808":{"dur":1,"text":"up, and they've got something to eat."},"809":{"dur":1,"text":"So, good things happen."},"810":{"dur":3,"text":"And then, you practice taking that carrier\nlike in the car where there's loud noises"},"814":{"dur":3,"text":"and things like this, or whatever, so they're\nvery used to the carrier."},"817":{"dur":2,"text":"Like, the carrier itself is no big deal."},"820":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, if they don't like, let's say if they're\na dog or cat who's nervous around a lot of"},"823":{"dur":4,"text":"other people and things like this, then definitely\nthey'll need some sedation to help them with"},"828":{"dur":1,"text":"travel."},"829":{"dur":4,"text":"Because, you're going to have to be at that\nterminal, whatever, the gate area waiting"},"833":{"dur":4,"text":"to get on that flight with your pet in their\ncarrier to go on board with you."},"837":{"dur":3,"text":"Also, too, if they're going through any kind\nof cargo, they're going to be going through"},"841":{"dur":1,"text":"a lot of different people."},"842":{"dur":3,"text":"They're not out of the carrier, but still,\njust people picking up and handling the carrier,"},"846":{"dur":3,"text":"a lot of noise, a lot of going down conveyer\nbelts and things like this."},"849":{"dur":2,"text":"So, it's much better for them to be sedated."},"851":{"dur":4,"text":">>Kelly Runyon:\nAre certain breeds of animals, dogs I guess"},"856":{"dur":4,"text":"in this case, cats too, prone to different\ntravel problems?"},"860":{"dur":4,"text":"You know, like we mentioned before we started\nthis interview talking about pugs."},"865":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, that breed might be, you know, they\nmight have a breathing issue."},"869":{"dur":1,"text":">>Dr. Sally Foote:\nRight."},"870":{"dur":5,"text":"So, breathing, breeds that have a pushed-in\nface, so that's going to be in dogs, like"},"876":{"dur":7,"text":"your pug dogs, your boxer dogs or English\nbulldogs to name a few, or Pekingese\u2019s are"},"883":{"dur":5,"text":"another, then see, when a dog gets excited\nor anxious, they tend to pant."},"888":{"dur":5,"text":"And while panting can release body heat to\na point, then it's a lot of work, and it creates"},"893":{"dur":1,"text":"body heat."},"894":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's a part of how they can get overheated."},"897":{"dur":3,"text":"And now they get in this vicious cycle of\nnow I'm hot, I've got to pant, and I'm nervous,"},"900":{"dur":1,"text":"and I'm panting."},"901":{"dur":3,"text":"And they can't get enough air in, they can't\nbecause they have a pushed-in face."},"905":{"dur":6,"text":"So, they're a higher risk for travel, especially\nsay, maybe by airline."},"911":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's where actually if they're a little\nbit sedated, and I don't mean that they're"},"914":{"dur":5,"text":"anesthetized, but like I said, they're just\nkind of drunk, then they may just be like,"},"920":{"dur":3,"text":"okay I'll just lay here and rest instead of\npacing and panting."},"924":{"dur":3,"text":"And it actually can help a bit with their\nbreathing."},"927":{"dur":3,"text":"But it's a case by case thing, definitely\nsomething you need to discuss with your veterinarian"},"931":{"dur":1,"text":"long before you go on the trip."},"932":{"dur":2,"text":"Please do not call two days before your trip."},"934":{"dur":1,"text":"I get that sometimes."},"935":{"dur":1,"text":"\"We're going on a trip.\""},"937":{"dur":1,"text":"When are you

Foote:\nUh huh."},"984":{"dur":1,"text":">>Kelly Runyon:\nSo, how can you take the fear out of a pet"},"986":{"dur":2,"text":"owner that will have to board their animal?"},"988":{"dur":3,"text":">>Dr. Sally Foote:\nThe first thing I like to suggest to my clients"},"991":{"dur":5,"text":"is, you know, go to a boarding facility, walk\nthrough it, ask what their policies are, ask"},"997":{"dur":4,"text":"if they provide what I call a pet report card,\nwhich is just, they will give you a little"},"1002":{"dur":1,"text":"like report card day by day."},"1003":{"dur":2,"text":"How did they eat, how were their bowel movements,\nwhat was their attitude?"},"1006":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's always nice, because then you can\nsee when you pick your pet up how they did,"},"1010":{"dur":1,"text":"and you know they're really paying a lot of\nattention to them."},"1012":{"dur":4,"text":"But then, the second thing is take your dog,\nor even your cat, to this place for just daycare"},"1017":{"dur":1,"text":"for a day or two."},"1019":{"dur":1,"text":"Just take them there for one day."},"1020":{"dur":3,"text":"Go shopping, go out to lunch for two or three\nhours, and then pick up your pet and ask how"},"1024":{"dur":1,"text":"did he do, so then you know."},"1026":{"dur":2,"text":"And they will usually tell you did he eat,\nor was he nervous."},"1028":{"dur":4,"text":"And number two, this gives your pet a chance\nto get used to the place before being left"},"1032":{"dur":1,"text":"for a longer period."},"1034":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, that can really be helpful."},"1036":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, if you have a pet who tends to be really\nnervous, using some of the products I mentioned"},"1040":{"dur":3,"text":"about say, travel in the car, can also be\nused at the boarding kennel."},"1044":{"dur":4,"text":"I have some clients, where we send them off\nwith say, some of the supplement for their"},"1049":{"dur":1,"text":"boarding days."},"1051":{"dur":3,"text":"And the boarding kennel will give it to them,\nand they know it just helps kind of take the"},"1054":{"dur":1,"text":"nervousness off of them."},"1056":{"dur":6,"text":"And it's better for the pet, and it's better\nfor the boarding facility, you know, as well,"},"1062":{"dur":1,"text":"too."},"1063":{"dur":3,"text":"And that is about like, the best way, you\nknow, to go about doing it."},"1067":{"dur":2,"text":">>Kelly Runyon:\nWhat other, you mentioned the report card,"},"1069":{"dur":3,"text":"other questions that pet owners should ask?"},"1072":{"dur":2,"text":"Should they be able to see where their dog\nand cat are going to be?"},"1075":{"dur":1,"text":">>Dr. Sally Foote:\nYes, they should."},"1076":{"dur":3,"text":"They should be able to walk through and see\nwhere they are, and see where they're staying."},"1080":{"dur":4,"text":"And you know, ask things like, do you have\nsay, extra play time."},"1084":{"dur":3,"text":"And that might be an additional charge, but\nif they have say, like a play yard where the"},"1087":{"dur":4,"text":"dog can go out with a handler and then get\nplay time, that can be an excellent way to"},"1091":{"dur":3,"text":"decrease boredom and problems with boarding."},"1095":{"dur":4,"text":"You know, there are some places say, that\nboard cats also have like a cat play room,"},"1099":{"dur":2,"text":"and they can have a cat in there."},"1101":{"dur":6,"text":"Ask about their policies for, you know, vaccination,\netc., or worming, all the animals are up to"},"1107":{"dur":1,"text":"date on that."},"1108":{"dur":6,"text":"And thirdly, also ask them what is their policy,\nor most of them will be asking you this, who"},"1115":{"dur":4,"text":"is your veterinarian or what their policy\nis in the event of an emergency, that your"},"1119":{"dur":1,"text":"pet becomes ill while they're boarding."},"1121":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean, it can happen."},"1123":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, where do they go, you know, are they\ngoing to, and that you are signing say, a"},"1127":{"dur":6,"text":"release to the boarding facility to be able\nto provide the necessary care for your pet"},"1133":{"dur":1,"text":"while they're boarding."},"1134":{"dur":1,"text":"This is really important."},"1136":{"dur":5,"text":"I mean, it's kind of just like if you had\nto leave your children, you know, you've gto"},"1141":{"dur":1,"text":"to go somewhere."},"1142":{"dur":3,"text":"And it's scary, yet if you did need to leave\nyour children, you would want to make sure"},"1145":{"dur":3,"text":"that you were signing some kind of a paper\nthat authorized this caregiver to take your"},"1149":{"dur":2,"text":"child to the doctor or the hospital if they\ngot ill."},"1152":{"dur":6,"text":"Because without that, legally I can't provide\ncare on your behalf."},"1158":{"dur":4,"text":"You know, it's a whole relationship of who's\nbringing this animal in."},"1162":{"dur":4,"text":"So, that's another, and again, for the boarding\nfacility, have a copy of those records, have"},"1167":{"dur":4,"text":"a copy of what the medications are, even if\nthey're not currently taking them."},"1171":{"dur":2,"text":"It just makes everything a whole lot better."},"1174":{"dur":3,"text":">>Kelly Runyon:\nYou mentioned what if you have an emergency,"},"1177":{"dur":5,"text":"and that brings me to my next question, is\nwhat if you do take Ranger with you to some"},"1182":{"dur":3,"text":"other state, and there is an emergency?"},"1186":{"dur":3,"text":"I've known that to happen to people, where\ntheir dog or cat gets sick."},"1190":{"dur":1,"text":"How would you know where to go and what to\ndo?"},"1191":{"dur":5,"text":"Do you just go to the vet that's there, or\nwhat's your best advice for that?"},"1197":{"dur":2,"text":">>Dr. Sally Foote:\nMy best advice would be kind of like before"},"1200":{"dur":6,"text":"you take your trip, scout out who are the\nveterinarians in the area."},"1206":{"dur":3,"text":"And you know, yeah, I know it's a little bit\nhit or miss on just picking a veterinary clinic,"},"1210":{"dur":5,"text":"but you know, just look to see, usually a\nlarger clinic, you know, who has the most"},"1215":{"dur":1,"text":"hours."},"1216":{"dur":3,"text":"So that way, if you had a problem in the daytime,\nyou'd have a place that's open."},"1220":{"dur":3,"text":"You might even just say, oh this looks like\na good clinic, call them ahead of time."},"1223":{"dur":3,"text":"Say if I was traveling through, what's your\npolicy if I'm just traveling through and I"},"1227":{"dur":3,"text":"had a problem with my pet, and I needed to\nstop in for care?"},"1230":{"dur":4,"text":"Do you have what we call, say, urgent care\nappointments, you know, open for people to"},"1234":{"dur":1,"text":"bring a pet in?"},"1236":{"dur":5,"text":"You know, or is there like, an emergency clinic,\nsay for example, the University of Illinois'"},"1242":{"dur":2,"text":"emergency clinic room, it's open 24 hours\na day."},"1245":{"dur":3,"text":"So, if you had a daytime emergency, frankly\nthat would be the best place to go because"},"1248":{"dur":3,"text":"you know they would be able to see your pet\nright then."},"1252":{"dur":3,"text":"Where in another clinic, if they're booked\nup, you know, the doctor might be out for"},"1255":{"dur":2,"text":"a few hours in the afternoon, that can be\na little hit or miss."},"1258":{"dur":7,"text":"So, these days with Google, and you just sort\nof, like a triptych, go down your route."},"1265":{"dur":4,"text":"Start saying emergency clinics in this area,\nand put it in your phone, whatever."},"1269":{"dur":1,"text":"Make a list for yourself."},"1271":{"dur":4,"text":"And then, wherever you are geographically,\nyou could say let's check out there."},"1275":{"dur":5,"text":"Most all, if you were in between those points,\nmost every veterinary clinic, if it's after"},"1281":{"dur":3,"text":"hours they're going to say whether they take\nemergency, or what the emergency clinic is"},"1285":{"dur":2,"text":"in their region that they're referring to."},"1287":{"dur":1,"text":"So, if you called that, you would know."},"1289":{"dur":3,"text":"And again, you would bring your record of,\nyou know, what medications or history of,"},"1292":{"dur":2,"text":"you know, your pets, your pet's health history."},"1295":{"dur":1,"text":">>Kelly Runyon:\nThat's right, your folder."},"1296":{"dur":1,"text":">>Dr. Sally Foote:\nYour folder, thank you."},"1297":{"dur":2,"text":">>Kelly Runyon:\nWell, as we wrap up our interview, you get"},"1299":{"dur":6,"text":"to your destination, and you get Ranger up\nto the hotel room all safe and sound."},"1305":{"dur":3,"text":"How can you acclimate Ranger to that new environment,\nnow that you've made it safe?"},"1309":{"dur":2,"text":">>Dr. Sally Foote:\nWe've got our goody bag."},"1311":{"dur":4,"text":"And we have his little blankie, and we have\nhis food."},"1316":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, we have all his things from home."},"1318":{"dur":4,"text":"And that\u2019s what we're going to have in that\nlike hotel room, kind of his own little corner."},"1323":{"dur":4,"text":"And we'll put his carrier nearby there, so\nhe can sleep in his carrier and be there."},"1327":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, you know, he could roam around the room,\netc."},"1330":{"dur":4,"text":"But again, most hotels require that if you\nare not in the room, that the animal needs"},"1335":{"dur":3,"text":"to be in its carrier so it's not doing any\nkind of damage, you know, in the room."},"1338":{"dur":2,"text":"So, even if you have to step out and go out\nto dinner, you might be able to leave the"},"1340":{"dur":1,"text":"pet in the room that way."},"1342":{"dur":5,"text":"But that\u2019s one way how to make it nice for\nthem in that, you know."},"1347":{"dur":5,"text":"If you have to go up and down a stairway or\nup and down an elevator, take some treats"},"1352":{"dur":4,"text":"with you, like with a dog, and reward them\nas you go,
