really looking for."},"241":{"dur":7,"text":"So we looked at some research\nand we found out that families"},"249":{"dur":4,"text":"have an expectation for high\nquality,

a number of\nstakeholders and agencies,"},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"boards, and commissions \nand divisions in the city"},"290":{"dur":3,"text":"that got together along with our\ncommunity partners to look at"},"293":{"dur":4,"text":"what the needs were and to look\nat what could happen around that"},"298":{"dur":3,"text":"and identifying that it wasn't\njust licensed

--"},"369":{"dur":1,"text":"all pointed that we were \non the right track."},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"Then we developed \nthe strategy"},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"and then following that we said,\n\"Okay,
