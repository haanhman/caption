all,"},"105":{"dur":3,"text":"the Open Programme is for\nsophisticated students."},"109":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we needed a\nsophisticated environment"},"111":{"dur":1,"text":"to talk about the\nOpen

throughout\nthis session, we've"},"164":{"dur":2,"text":"been talking a bit about\nlanguages, a bit about maths,"},"166":{"dur":2,"text":"and ways of fitting things in\nthat are really

something"},"175":{"dur":2,"text":"that you're interested in,\nyou've always wanted to do it,"},"177":{"dur":2,"text":"maybe something to\ndo with your work."},"179":{"dur":2,"text":"Lots of reasons\nwhy students choose"},"181":{"dur":1,"text":"different kinds of modules."},"183":{"dur":3,"text":"And it may look really\nodd mixture of modules,"},"186":{"dur":2,"text":"to anybody looking in\noutside, but, if you"},"188":{"dur":3,"text":"look at the whole student,\ntheir kind of whole life,"},"191":{"dur":3,"text":"it actually makes sense\nto them and the way it"},"194":{"dur":1,"text":"all fits together."},"196":{"dur":2,"text":"So the important thing\nis, and we hold up our -"},"198":{"dur":0,"text":"HELEN COOKE: Yeah."},"199":{"dur":0,"text":"PETER TAYLOR: - first."},"200":{"dur":1,"text":"HELEN COOKE: So there's\nlots of different ways"},"202":{"dur":1,"text":"of building an Open degree."},"203":{"dur":3,"text":"So of your 360\ncredits, you might"},"206":{"dur":3,"text":"choose to do a range of\ndifferent combinations"},"210":{"dur":2,"text":"at each of the three\nlevels, so at stages"},"212":{"dur":2,"text":"one, level one, level\ntwo, and level three."},"215":{"dur":0,"text":"That's one option."},"216":{"dur":2,"text":"You can kind of mix\nand match as you like."},"218":{"dur":2,"text":"The other way of\ndoing it is perhaps"},"221":{"dur":1,"text":"choosing two\nparticular subjects."},"223":{"dur":4,"text":"So you might choose maths\nand music, for example."},"227":{"dur":4,"text":"And you'd then study\n180 credits of maths"},"232":{"dur":4,"text":"and 180s credits of music."},"237":{"dur":1,"text":"And obviously, you\ncan mix and match"},"238":{"dur":2,"text":"those subjects, as\nyou choose, what"},"241":{"dur":1,"text":"might be relevant\nto your career,"},"242":{"dur":2,"text":"your own personal interests."},"245":{"dur":2,"text":"And providing that you study\nthe right number of credits"},"248":{"dur":1,"text":"at each level,\nthen you can build"},"249":{"dur":1,"text":"a degree that is unique to you."},"251":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: And I\nguess this is important,"},"252":{"dur":0,"text":"because you couldn't,\nall of a sudden,"},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"start doing maths and music\nand then say, hey, I fancy"},"255":{"dur":1,"text":"a bit of chemistry\nright at the end,"},"257":{"dur":2,"text":"because you wouldn't, I guess,\nhave the grounding in it, would"},"259":{"dur":1,"text":"PETER TAYLOR: Well, it depends."},"261":{"dur":3,"text":"If you've done something before,\nso you might be prepared,"},"264":{"dur":4,"text":"then you might be able to do\na kind of higher level module."},"268":{"dur":2,"text":"But if you've never\ndone maths before,"},"271":{"dur":2,"text":"doing kind of third\nlevel quantum physics"},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"is probably going to\nbe a bit of a stretch."},"276":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's sensible about thinking\nabout how you're building"},"279":{"dur":1,"text":"your knowledge up\nthrough the programme."},"281":{"dur":1,"text":"And one of the\nthings that we have,"},"283":{"dur":4,"text":"for these kind of 180\nstrands, is suggested"},"287":{"dur":3,"text":"modules that kind of\nfeed into each other."},"290":{"dur":1,"text":"And they're available."},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"HELEN COOKE: So they're\navailable on the Open Degree"},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"Student Qualification website."},"297":{"dur":2,"text":"And there's a whole range\nof different subjects."},"299":{"dur":1,"text":"We've just picked a\nfew examples here."},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"And we've developed\nthese, with faculties,"},"303":{"dur":2,"text":"so there are modules that\nfit together well in terms"},"305":{"dur":1,"text":"of the curriculum."},"306":{"dur":2,"text":"And they really just give\nadvice in terms of the modules"},"309":{"dur":1,"text":"that students\nmight want to study"},"311":{"dur":2,"text":"at each of the three levels."},"313":{"dur":3,"text":"So we've got psychology\nhere as one example."},"316":{"dur":3,"text":"And behind, we've got\nhealth and social care."},"320":{"dur":3,"text":"So we've got them in a whole\nrange of different subjects."},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"And students aren't\nstuck to these."},"326":{"dur":3,"text":"They can still add other\nmodules to fit alongside it"},"329":{"dur":0,"text":"if they like."},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Now a lot of these\npathways will start with one,"},"333":{"dur":1,"text":"like K101 for example."},"334":{"dur":1,"text":"So there is a limited\nrange of routes"},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"that people can start\naccessing a curriculum through."},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"And with the Open Programme,\nyou can change as you're going."},"341":{"dur":0,"text":"So you might be on\na qualification,"},"342":{"dur":1,"text":"and then you might\ndecide that you actually"},"343":{"dur":1,"text":"want to do two things, and\nyou might want to change."},"345":{"dur":2,"text":"How do students go about\ndoing things like that?"},"347":{"dur":1,"text":"PETER TAYLOR: The\nfirst thing is you"},"349":{"dur":2,"text":"need to start on an key\nintroductory module."},"351":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's kind of developing\nyour key skills for studying."},"354":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's the first bit."},"356":{"dur":3,"text":"And a lot of people will say, I\nreally want to do this subject."},"360":{"dur":1,"text":"And they'll start studying it."},"362":{"dur":3,"text":"But then, actually, as\nthey kind of go through it,"},"365":{"dur":1,"text":"they might suddenly\ndecide, well, I'm"},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"not really as interested\nin it as I thought I was."},"369":{"dur":2,"text":"But this thing really\ndoes interest me."},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"So they can swap\nat various points."},"374":{"dur":1,"text":"So you can swap qualifications."},"375":{"dur":2,"text":"You can move, from a named\ndegree, into the Open"},"378":{"dur":2,"text":"Programme, and from the Open\nProgramme, into named degrees,"},"380":{"dur":0,"text":"during your study."},"381":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: And\nthis is something"},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"that's really quite unique\nto the Open University."},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"PETER TAYLOR: Well, it's\na really unique offer,"},"387":{"dur":3,"text":"because we don't have\ntimetabling problems."},"390":{"dur":1,"text":"Any other university\nthat is offering"},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"a range of different\nsubjects is always"},"395":{"dur":3,"text":"going to have problems of\nlectures clashing and the like."},"398":{"dur":3,"text":"But because of the way\nwe teach, we really"},"401":{"dur":1,"text":"don't have those problems."},"402":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can study\nany combinations"},"405":{"dur":1,"text":"in any way you want."},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we have some really\ninteresting students"},"409":{"dur":0,"text":"who've studied with us."},"410":{"dur":3,"text":"And you look at the reasons\nwhy they're studied, say,"},"413":{"dur":3,"text":"some business courses, because\nthey're running a business."},"416":{"dur":1,"text":"They might be doing\nsome languages,"},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"because they're selling\ninto a particular country."},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"They might do some science,\nbecause that's the

our cocktail"},"437":{"dur":2,"text":"party, because it's about\nalcohol in many ways."},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"But alcohol isn't just about -"},"442":{"dur":0,"text":"PETER TAYLOR: Well, it's not."},"443":{"dur":0,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"444":{"dur":1,"text":"HELEN COOKE:\nPretend to have fun."},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"PETER TAYLOR: But if it was\nan appropriate time not at"},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: I think that's\na very appropriate time."},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"I've been here all\nmorning. [LAUGHS]"},"453":{"dur":1,"text":"PETER TAYLOR: No, no,\nno, the powers that be"},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"would not let us do this."},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: At least\nwe'll impress them, anyway."},"459":{"dur":1,"text":"Right, we've asked\nour students how many"},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"subjects they're studying."},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"And most of them, 50%,\nwell, that's not most."},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"That's half."},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"But it's the highest\ncategory, which"},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"is important, as my colleagues\nin maths will tell me."},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"Are doing one subject."},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"So 42% are doing two."},"472":{"dur":4,"text":"And most students are\ndoing arts, humanities,"},"476":{"dur":2,"text":"and social sciences, at\n54%, followed closely"},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"by 46% doing STEM subjects."},"481":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's an interesting idea\nof who's out there watching."},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"Interesting that a lot of\npeople are doing two subjects"},"487":{"dur":1,"text":"as part of their degree."},"488":{"dur":3,"text":"So perhaps this is quite\na common option, is it?"},"491":{"dur":1,"text":"PETER TAYLOR: Indeed, it is."},"492":{"dur":3,"text":"Because I mean, if you need\nto kind of develop your skills"},"496":{"dur":3,"text":"and knowledge, within a\nparticular subject, then"},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"usually you need to do\npretty much 60 credits"},"502":{"dur":2,"text":"to actually grasp the\nsubject and then move on"},"504":{"dur":1,"text":"to the next level."},"506":{"dur":4,"text":"So a lot of our modules\nare around 60 credits."},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"So it's tending to push\npeople into those kind of two"},"512":{"dur":0,"text":"subjects."},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"Alternatively, you could\ndo one half in one subject."},"517":{"dur":1,"text":"And the other is\npretty much a mix"},"518":{"dur":3,"text":"and match, say, doing some\npsychology at level one,"},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"but then doing something\nelse at level 2."},"524":{"dur":0,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: Great."},"525":{"dur":1,"text":"It all sounds good to me."},"527":{"dur":2,"text":"Over on the hot desk, Kate,\nyou've done a lot of work"},"529":{"dur":2,"text":"with the Open Programme,\nso I hope

Oh."},"542":{"dur":1,"text":"PETER TAYLOR: Has it\ngot alcohol in it?"},"544":{"dur":2,"text":"KATE: Well, she hasn't said at\nthe moment, so we're not sure."},"547":{"dur":1,"text":"KAREN FOLEY: It's 5\no'clock somewhere."},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"And we've got an audience that\nare an international audience."},"551":{"dur":0,"text":"KATE: Yeah."},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"And Julia's been talking\nabout how she studies."},"554":{"dur":2,"text":"She's actually studied\nmaths and music."},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"And how they're actually not as\ndifferent as you might

three,"},"563":{"dur":1,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"565":{"dur":0,"text":"Lovely."},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's get on with the drinks."},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"HELEN COOKE: So we're\nhere having a lovely time."},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"Obviously, it's a\nnon-alcoholic cocktail party."},"572":{"dur":3,"text":"But there is a serious\nside to things, as well."},"576":{"dur":2,"text":"We wanted to

alcohol,"},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"so Peter is going to talk a\nlittle bit about chemistry."},"591":{"dur":1,"text":"Ah, I can bore you\nto death on this,"},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"so I'll talk to you as\nquickly as possible ."},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"So I've got some\nlittle molecular models"},"596":{"dur":0,"text":"there of ethanol."},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"So ethanol is what?"},"599":{"dur":1,"text":"The key ingredient of alcohol."},"601":{"dur":3,"text":"And one of the great\ndebates about wine making"},"604":{"dur":4,"text":"is about, is making wine\na science or is it an art?"},"608":{"dur":3,"text":"So one of the big,\nbig steps forward,"},"611":{"dur":2,"text":"particularly in kind of\ncountries like Australia"},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"and the like, is\nthe way that they've"},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"been able to take the grapes."},"619":{"dur":3,"text":"And they've been able to take a\nparticular yeast strain that's"},"622":{"dur":3,"text":"been genetically modified and\nput it into big stainless steel"},"626":{"dur":4,"text":"tanks to be able to\nsterilise it very easily"},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"and control the\nprocess of fermentation"},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"to give a good wine."},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"But then, if you go to\nFrance, then they'll"},"638":{"dur":1,"text":"say you can only go\nso far with that."},"640":{"dur":2,"text":"Because, after a while, it\nbecomes much more of an art."},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"It's a question of blending the\nvarious kind of grape mixtures"},"647":{"dur":1,"text":"to get a particular taste."},"648":{"dur":5,"text":"And that is very much down\nto the wine maker's art."},"654":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's an example of\nnothing is in one subject,"},"657":{"dur":1,"text":"but it's in a range of subjects."},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"And then on top of\nthat, you've got"},"660":{"dur":1,"text":"to think about\nhow you market it."},"662":{"dur":2,"text":"So there's a whole\narea around kind"},"664":{"dur":2,"text":"of marketing and\npackaging and the like,"},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"and logistics and delivery."},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"Then there's the kind\nof legal aspect of it,"},"671":{"dur":6,"text":"so what percentages are you\nallowed, or issues around"},"678":{"dur":3,"text":"kind of drink driving and\nthen the social implications"},"682":{"dur":3,"text":"of drinking and the kind\nof health and well-being."},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you just take just a\nsimple thing, like

from\ndifferent products,"},"741":{"dur":1,"text":"and actually using\nthem and, as you said,"},"743":{"dur":1,"text":"developing them into\ndifferent tastes."},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"So beer is

Sorry."},"761":{"dur":2,"text":"That's what we expect our\nstudents to do, as well, which"},"763":{"dur":1,"text":"is use their knowledge\nand their experience"},"765":{"dur":1,"text":"to build their
