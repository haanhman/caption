or their businesses or\ntheir projects, there\u2019s this recurring narrative"},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"everything\u2019s been done before."},"442":{"dur":3,"text":"And I was wondering if you can speak to originality\nvs. authenticity."},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"Ok, cool."},"446":{"dur":2,"text":"I\u2019m glad you brought this up."},"448":{"dur":4,"text":"So whenever I talk to somebody who has an\nidea that they\u2019re tremulously excited about,"},"453":{"dur":4,"text":"generally speaking within the next 2 minutes\nthey will say, \u201cBut, you know, it\u2019s

you.\u201d"},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"It has not yet been done by you."},"465":{"dur":4,"text":"And the answer is, yeah, guaranteed it\u2019s\nalready been done because humans are

done."},"476":{"dur":1,"text":"You know?"},"477":{"dur":1,"text":"And that\u2019s fine."},"478":{"dur":3,"text":"Like, even Shakespeare, half of his stories\nhe totally stole from older stories because"},"482":{"dur":2,"text":"there aren\u2019t that many new stories to tell."},"485":{"dur":5,"text":"But he told them in a way that had never been\ntold before and then 500 years later

guaranteed"},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"I could bring in, like, 10 professors and\nacademics who could look at it and say, \u201cWell,"},"504":{"dur":3,"text":"obviously this is somebody who had read this\nbook or they had heard this symphony or they"},"508":{"dur":3,"text":"had\u2026 they were playing off of this or they\nwere rejecting that."},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"They\u2019re responding.\u201d"},"513":{"dur":4,"text":"All we do as humans is respond to stuff that\u2019s\nalready come before us."},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"But you\u2019re allowed to add to the pile."},"519":{"dur":5,"text":"You\u2019re allowed to add to the pile and what\nI always say is whenever I look at art that\u2019s"},"524":{"dur":4,"text":"really original, I feel like I can admire\nit but it doesn't move me."},"529":{"dur":4,"text":"What moves me is the humanity in an authentic\npiece of creation where somebody was doing"},"534":{"dur":4,"text":"something, whatever it was, because they had\nto, because they wanted to, because it brought"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"them to life, because it ignited their soul."},"541":{"dur":4,"text":"That\u2019s what gives the shimmer of gold to\nsomething and makes me feel like my heart\u2019s"},"545":{"dur":4,"text":"been changed, my mind\u2019s been changed, the\nworld looks different than it did before."},"549":{"dur":1,"text":"So I don't care if it's been done."},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't care if it\u2019s been done 10 thousand\ntimes."},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"If you need to do it, do it."},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, there\u2019s 2 things I want to comment\non."},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"One, have you checked out Everything is a\nRemix?"},"559":{"dur":1,"text":"No."},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"Oh, I can\u2019t\u2026"},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"ok, so I\u2019m gonna email you on this."},"562":{"dur":1,"text":"You\u2019re gonna love it."},"563":{"dur":1,"text":"It speaks to this idea and it traces back\u2026"},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"Oh, that is a great shorthand for everything\nI just said."},"567":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah."},"568":{"dur":1,"text":"But it\u2019s brilliant and I think you\u2019re\ngonna love it."},"569":{"dur":4,"text":"But it\u2026 it really is true and I think there\u2019s\nso much relief that we can feel in that."},"574":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah."},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"I know in my own creative life\u2026"},"576":{"dur":1,"text":"Right."},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"...the pressure, you know, to keep creating\nand to keep pushing those edges and those"},"580":{"dur":3,"text":"boundaries and

thing that you tipped\noff for me was something else in the book"},"593":{"dur":3,"text":"that I absolutely loved and it was a real\nlightbulb moment."},"597":{"dur":1,"text":"I want to thank you for writing it."},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"It was about really examining your motivations."},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"Right."},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"And, you know, if you want to help people\u2026\nand this

me."},"609":{"dur":1,"text":"Please don't help me."},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"But this idea of creating because it brings\nyou joy."},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"Right, right."},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"Exactly."},"615":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean, I think when you\u2019re a good person\nand you\u2019re a giving person and you\u2019re"},"619":{"dur":4,"text":"a person of
