We"},"244":{"dur":1,"text":"have one corner done but here's the next"},"246":{"dur":2,"text":"corner but we have to get there first.

We're not there yet, we're"},"328":{"dur":2,"text":"actually early so we have to slip stitch"},"330":{"dur":3,"text":"across the next two double crochets. So"},"333":{"dur":1,"text":"we're doing this every time we're doing"},"335":{"dur":2,"text":"a round and then we get to ah"},"337":{"dur":1,"text":"slip stitch right into the chain three"},"339":{"dur":2,"text":"on the corner.

We have to chain two first and"},"374":{"dur":3,"text":"then do the next. This is the gapping"},"377":{"dur":2,"text":"space in the middle between the corners"},"380":{"dur":1,"text":"so every time you hit one of these it's"},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"always three double crochet and then"},"384":{"dur":4,"text":"chain two.

So"},"391":{"dur":1,"text":"the corners are always the same, three"},"393":{"dur":3,"text":"double crochet, three chains and three"},"396":{"dur":6,"text":"double crochet: one, two, and three. So the"},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"only difference is, is that there's going"},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"to be more and more spaces put in"},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"between the corner spaces. That's"},"409":{"dur":1,"text":"the only difference. So now that you have"},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"that our next corners way over here but"},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"we're not there yet. So we have to chain"},"414":{"dur":3,"text":"two, fill in the spaces in between, there's"},"418":{"dur":5,"text":"only one this time. There will be more as this thing gets bigger and there'll be"},"423":{"dur":1,"text":"three double crochets into each one of"},"425":{"dur":4,"text":"those and chain two. Here's your corner"},"429":{"dur":3,"text":"so three double crochet."},"435":{"dur":3,"text":"Okay chain three because you are in a corner."},"439":{"dur":7,"text":"And then three double crochet again."},"447":{"dur":2,"text":"Okay, so now the next corner is way over here."},"449":{"dur":1,"text":"It's already done because we started it"},"451":{"dur":1,"text":"so we only have the space left so we"},"453":{"dur":4,"text":"change to to get there. Three double"},"457":{"dur":1,"text":"crochets into each one of the spaces in"},"459":{"dur":5,"text":"between the corners and then chain two"},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"because we have to then attach it to the"},"466":{"dur":2,"text":"top of the chain three. So in the next"},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"revolutions that we have to do a few"},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"more of these and but I'm going to get"},"472":{"dur":1,"text":"you started because they're really"},"473":{"dur":1,"text":"there's no difference of what I'm"},"474":{"dur":0,"text":"showing you right now. The only"},"475":{"dur":1,"text":"difference is that there would be more"},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"gapping spaces. You can see now you have"},"479":{"dur":1,"text":"the corner. Your corners here and now you have"},"481":{"dur":1,"text":"two more spaces. So that's the only"},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"difference. So let me get started on the"},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"next one. So you have two more"},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"revolutions to do this. So I'm going to"},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"start you off with the first one. Is that"},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"we're going to slip stitch ourselves to"},"492":{"dur":1,"text":"the corner, just like you have been. And"},"494":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going to let you do both of these"},"496":{"dur":2,"text":"revolutions on your own so you're going"},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"to slip stitch to the corner, and now"},"500":{"dur":3,"text":"chain three and double crochet it three"},"504":{"dur":5,"text":"times, chain three, because you were in the"},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"corner and then double crochet three"},"512":{"dur":7,"text":"times. Ok and then we're now in the"},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"gapping spaces between the corners so"},"522":{"dur":3,"text":"how we do that is chaining two and then"},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"we just fill it in with three double"},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"crochets into each one of the chain"},"529":{"dur":4,"text":"spaces going across. Ok chaining two"},"534":{"dur":6,"text":"because you've got another space three double"},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"crochets here and then you're chaining"},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"two and then finally your corner. So it's"},"546":{"dur":6,"text":"three double crochet: one, two, and three."},"552":{"dur":3,"text":"Chaining three: one, two, and three and then"},"556":{"dur":1,"text":"three double crochet. So I want you to"},"558":{"dur":1,"text":"finish this round just like I've showed"},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"you before and then I want you to do one"},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"more round of this and then we're going"},"563":{"dur":1,"text":"to do something a little different from"},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"that point. So continue to do that."},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"Now since I last left you I did one"},"570":{"dur":1,"text":"extra round and I'm just coming around"},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"and I'm just going to slip stitch it to"},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"the top of the beginning chain three."},"575":{"dur":1,"text":"So the final revolution that I have for you"},"577":{"dur":2,"text":"today is that we need to make sure that"},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"we have a nice thick border just like so."},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"So how we achieve that is that we"},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"immediately start off and we don't make"},"587":{"dur":1,"text":"our way we don't slip stitch our way to"},"588":{"dur":1,"text":"the corner like we have beenm we"},"590":{"dur":1,"text":"immediately just chain up three and then"},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"we double crochet into each one of the"},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"double crochets that are available. No"},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"biggie right? So on the corners, what"},"599":{"dur":1,"text":"you're always going to do is that you're"},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"always going to put in five double"},"603":{"dur":10,"text":"crochets. So one, two, three, four, and five."},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"So when you're working your way down you"},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"see that there's three double crochets"},"616":{"dur":1,"text":"there's chain two, three double crochets."},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"So each one of the double crochets is"},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"going to get one double crochet. No"},"623":{"dur":1,"text":"biggie right? So you're just following"},"624":{"dur":3,"text":"exactly what's there and then simply"},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"when you get to your chain two spaces"},"629":{"dur":1,"text":"you put in two double crochets into"},"631":{"dur":4,"text":"those spaces itself. Okay so one double"},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"crochet into each of the double crochets"},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"and chain two spaces will have two"},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"double crochets and the corners will"},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"have five double crochets. So continue"},"645":{"dur":1,"text":"that all the way around and then when we"},"647":{"dur":3,"text":"come back I'll show you more. So I'm"},"650":{"dur":1,"text":"making my way all the way around and"},"652":{"dur":1,"text":"filling in my very last space of just"},"653":{"dur":1,"text":"two double crochets because that's what"},"655":{"dur":1,"text":"you need and then we just have to slip"},"657":{"dur":1,"text":"stitches to the top of the beginning"},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"chain three.

So we're"},"762":{"dur":1,"text":"going to start off with a slip knot and"},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"I want you to chain two. So let's do that"},"767":{"dur":2,"text":"so one and two and then going to the"},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"beginning chain that you started with I"},"771":{"dur":2,"text":"want you to put five single crochets"},"774":{"dur":1,"text":"into that same stitch. This will make it"},"776":{"dur":6,"text":"go into a semi circle. So one, two, and"},"783":{"dur":7,"text":"three, four, and five and we're not going"},"790":{"dur":1,"text":"to go all the way around. This is only a"},"792":{"dur":1,"text":"semicircle so now what I want you to do"},"794":{"dur":1,"text":"is turn the project around and we're"},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"going to start working going in the"},"797":{"dur":3,"text":"other direction. To begin row number two"},"800":{"dur":1,"text":"we're just going to begin by chaining"},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"one. Starting with this the first one"},"804":{"dur":1,"text":"that is directly underneath we want to"},"806":{"dur":2,"text":"put two single crochets into that one"},"808":{"dur":2,"text":"and into every one of the five that are"},"810":{"dur":2,"text":"there. So that would come to the next one"},"813":{"dur":1,"text":"that's available to you and we put it"},"814":{"dur":2,"text":"into there as well. So two single"},"817":{"dur":1,"text":"crochets into each one of the stitches"},"819":{"dur":5,"text":"going across. So this one then from five"},"824":{"dur":2,"text":"stitches and by the time you finish it's"},"826":{"dur":3,"text":"going to turn it into 10. And we come"},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"into our last one"},"831":{"dur":2,"text":"getting our two in there and then that's"},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"a row number two. So let's begin our next"},"836":{"dur":3,"text":"one. Let's turn our work and begin. Let's"},"840":{"dur":1,"text":"begin our next one.

So the repeat pattern"},"853":{"dur":1,"text":"going all the way across, is that the"},"855":{"dur":1,"text":"next one is going to have two single"},"856":{"dur":4,"text":"crochets and then the next one will have"},"861":{"dur":3,"text":"one. Okay so the next one is two single"},"865":{"dur":4,"text":"crochets and the next one will have one."},"870":{"dur":2,"text":"Keep doing that all the way across. So"},"872":{"dur":4,"text":"the next one is two.
