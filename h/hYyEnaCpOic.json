The Bubb report mentioned looking at"},"1537":{"dur":5,"text":"some sort of academy, concentrating very much\non positive behaviour support, which we know"},"1543":{"dur":3,"text":"can impact on the way that people with challenging\nbehaviour are managed and dealt with.

So"},"1674":{"dur":6,"text":"not all of us have had a chance to read it\nin detail. So thank you for that explanation."},"1681":{"dur":4,"text":"Let me invite comment. I have John Burn and\nMargaret."},"1685":{"dur":7,"text":"John Burn: Jane, three questions, [inaudible].\nThe first one you have already addressed,"},"1694":{"dur":6,"text":"but just to be clear. Why do you think there\nis such a disparity between the north and"},"1700":{"dur":5,"text":"the south, in terms of hospital occupancy\nand whether that reflects quality of care"},"1706":{"dur":7,"text":"or other factors? Answer that one first because\nthat is the simplest question I will ask."},"1713":{"dur":5,"text":"Jane Cummings: Okay, good. What we do know\nis that there is a supply-led demand. We know"},"1719":{"dur":6,"text":"that the number of beds in the north is significantly\nhigher than the south of the country, south"},"1726":{"dur":4,"text":"in London. Actually, when you look at the\ninformation, the Midlands and east is the"},"1730":{"dur":5,"text":"second highest and, actually, they have got\nquite a lot of beds as well. So our belief"},"1736":{"dur":7,"text":"is that most of that is supply-led. There\nis a bed; it is easier to admit. So that is"},"1744":{"dur":2,"text":"probably easier.\nJohn Burn: So that is really the supply issue,"},"1746":{"dur":6,"text":"rather than a necessarily different quality\nof care. The second question is, the number"},"1752":{"dur":4,"text":"of people involved here is a small number\nof thousands. However, the number of people"},"1757":{"dur":4,"text":"with significant learning disabilities, especially\nif you wrap in autistic spectrum disorders,"},"1762":{"dur":5,"text":"runs into the many hundreds of thousands,\nor certainly many tens of thousands. So there"},"1767":{"dur":4,"text":"is obviously an iceberg effect there that\npeople, perhaps, are not in any kind of care,"},"1771":{"dur":4,"text":"being cared for by their families or whatever.\nTo what extent are we going to drill down"},"1776":{"dur":2,"text":"to try and pull them into the system?"},"1778":{"dur":6,"text":"Jane Cummings: You are absolutely right. This\nis really the tip of the iceberg. So some"},"1784":{"dur":5,"text":"of our figures show 2,600. The census data,\nwhich is a provider-led information used,"},"1790":{"dur":4,"text":"is just over 3,000. That does include people\nthat are commissioned by local authority,"},"1795":{"dur":5,"text":"not just NHS. Our best guess is that there\nis probably about 24,000 people out there"},"1800":{"dur":7,"text":"that could possibly be at risk of admission.\nAs you said, there are, I think, up to 2 million"},"1808":{"dur":5,"text":"people with some form of learning disability.\nSo there are a lot. The vast majority of support"},"1813":{"dur":6,"text":"in care is provided either in people's own\nhomes or supported by local authorities in"},"1820":{"dur":0,"text":"particular."},"1821":{"dur":6,"text":"As part of what we are doing, one of the reasons\nwhy it is so important that we do this together,"},"1827":{"dur":4,"text":"is actually that we work alongside local authorities.\nSo we have a much better understanding of"},"1831":{"dur":10,"text":"the whole cohort. The Care Act also put in\nplace proper assessments and plans for children;"},"1842":{"dur":5,"text":"so children with special educational needs.\nThat starts from April. So that means for"},"1847":{"dur":5,"text":"children - and children are a vital part of\nthis - people should have an assessment which"},"1852":{"dur":5,"text":"includes local authority, education and health\nand a plan. So as we move forward, we will"},"1858":{"dur":5,"text":"be much more aware of the needs of the children.\nAs children then grow and transition into"},"1863":{"dur":5,"text":"adulthood, we should have a much better understanding\nof what those needs are. I would expect us"},"1869":{"dur":5,"text":"to be implementing some of the thing we are\ndoing now, much earlier on. So we can stop"},"1874":{"dur":3,"text":"people being admitted and stop them needing\nto be admitted."},"1877":{"dur":3,"text":"John Burn: The third point, I would just make\na comment because it is out with the remit"},"1881":{"dur":4,"text":"of this item. However, the point that Jane\nhas made that there are probably two million"},"1885":{"dur":5,"text":"people out there with significant learning\ndisabilities, functional illiteracy and so"},"1890":{"dur":5,"text":"on, I think the whole system needs to conscious\nof the challenge of someone with functional"},"1895":{"dur":4,"text":"illiteracy turning up in hospital and being\ngiven consent forms that they cannot understand"},"1900":{"dur":4,"text":"and so on. So I think this is a whole system\nissue, although this is a very important tip"},"1904":{"dur":0,"text":"of the iceberg."},"1905":{"dur":7,"text":"Jane Cummings: Just really briefly, there\nis quite a lot of work going on around making"},"1913":{"dur":6,"text":"exceptions and supporting people that actually\ngo in, for example, acute hospitals. The east"},"1920":{"dur":4,"text":"of England have done a significant amount\nof work on that, called reasonable adjustments."},"1925":{"dur":4,"text":"That is about looking at what people might\nneed in doing things, for example, like making"},"1929":{"dur":4,"text":"sure that you have got somebody that use Makaton\nor can converse with somebody; that you may"},"1933":{"dur":4,"text":"put appointments at the beginning of a day,\nrather than at the end of the day; that you"},"1937":{"dur":7,"text":"are very conscious that noise, sound, unusual\ncircumstances can have a massive impact on"},"1945":{"dur":6,"text":"people, on somebody's behaviour, particularly\nif that is quite distressing. So there is"},"1951":{"dur":4,"text":"quite a lot of work that we have done. However,\nI would not underestimate that there is a"},"1955":{"dur":0,"text":"lot more that we can do."},"1956":{"dur":7,"text":"Margaret Casely-Hayford: First of all, actually\nJane, I have to say that I am really pleased"},"1965":{"dur":7,"text":"with the width of the programme and the way\nit is moved on and the detail that is gone"},"1973":{"dur":7,"text":"into the work, is really praiseworthy. You\ntouched on children, adolescents and I am"},"1983":{"dur":5,"text":"glad that you did because my first question\nwas going to be about the lead organisations"},"1988":{"dur":6,"text":"and why it is that there is not a lead organisation\nthat focuses on children and adolescents,"},"1995":{"dur":6,"text":"because, to me, that is a really important\npart of the whole package."},"2001":{"dur":7,"text":"My next question, to a large extent, has been\nraised by John. That is really to do with"},"2009":{"dur":7,"text":"the pressures that are imposed on the social\nside, by the tip of the iceberg concept, aherefore,"},"2017":{"dur":7,"text":"the correlative pressure that will put on\nputting people back into to the 'let's keep"},"2028":{"dur":6,"text":"them in' philosophy because we have not actually\ngot the package sorted yet; and how in a few"},"2034":{"dur":4,"text":"years' time, we are not going to find ourselves\nagain in a situation in which Stephen Bubb"},"2039":{"dur":7,"text":"has to come and carry out another review.\nAnd, to a large extent, whether the workforce"},"2053":{"dur":7,"text":"aspect of that, that the model is to be augmented\nby the third sector, and if so - again you"},"2065":{"dur":7,"text":"have touched on this - the extent to which\nHEE will embrace what's required to bring"},"2074":{"dur":7,"text":"on the third sector to get the third sector\nto support the social services, because there"},"2083":{"dur":3,"text":"is so much par in that army of support?"},"2086":{"dur":7,"text":"Jane Cummings: Okay, so in terms of your point\nabout lead organisation for children and young"},"2095":{"dur":7,"text":"people, I think it is a vital part of everybody.\nWe could do that but my feeling is that it"},"2103":{"dur":6,"text":"should be an integrated part of everything\nwe do; so rather than making it just one person's"},"2109":{"dur":6,"text":"business and others not having that interest.\nSo for us, as commissioners, it is really"},"2115":{"dur":5,"text":"important. For the department, in terms of\nsome of their policy leads, it is really important."},"2121":{"dur":5,"text":"For local authorities, it is critical. So\nI think, together, we can actually make quite"},"2127":{"dur":7,"text":"a difference. The key for me is actually starting\nearly. We know, from some of the organisation,"},"2135":{"dur":5,"text":"like the Family's Forum, like the Challenging\nBehaviour Foundation, children and young people"},"2140":{"dur":6,"text":"and supporting them early, is an absolutely\nvital part of their concerns. They work with"},"2147":{"dur":7,"text":"us. They ask us questions about that all of\nthe time. So nobody is going to let us forget"},"2155":{"dur":4,"text":"it and we will not forget it ourselves."},"2160":{"dur":4,"text":"In terms of future proofing, I think the point\nyou make is well made. We have had problems"},"2165":{"dur":7,"text":"and a lack of action for years and years.\nAnd so one of the reasons why we are so committed"},"2174":{"dur":3,"text":"to make sure that we do not end up in three\nor five years' time in the same position,"},"2177":{"dur":5,"text":"is that we are concentrating very much on\ngiving people with learning disability and"},"2183":{"dur":5,"text":"their families the rights and power to talk\nabout what they want. It is not about 'being"},"2188":{"dur":4,"text":"done to', it is not about us deciding what\nhappens to them.

The\nwhole shift to being very [inaudible] openness"},"2199":{"dur":5,"text":"and transparency and being very clear about\nthe position we are in, what we are doing,"},"2204":{"dur":4,"text":"reporting on information, reporting on admissions,\nreporting on discharges, I think gives that"},"2209":{"dur":1,"text":"focus."},"2210":{"dur":4,"text":"Concentrating very much on avoiding admission\nwill help. As we start to reduce the number"},"2215":{"dur":5,"text":"of people that are in inpatient beds and we\nbuild facilities in the community, my expectation"},"2220":{"dur":4,"text":"is that actually we start to make this business\nas usual; it becomes normal practice for people"},"2225":{"dur":5,"text":"to stay and be supported in the community\nsetting and it will be an exception for admission."},"2230":{"dur":4,"text":"In terms of the workforce, you are absolutely\nright. One of the things that happened with"},"2235":{"dur":6,"text":"the Stephen Bubb group, was that included\nquite a lot of both independent and voluntary"},"2242":{"dur":6,"text":"sector organisations.
