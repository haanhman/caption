Curry,"},"92":{"dur":2,"text":"and it was a very easy\ndecision I think for"},"94":{"dur":2,"text":"our committee to choose\nyou for this award."},"97":{"dur":2,"text":"So, take us back a little bit."},"100":{"dur":1,"text":"You grew up here in the Midwest,"},"101":{"dur":1,"text":"Rock Island, I think."},"102":{"dur":1,"text":"- Rock Island, Illinois, born and raised."},"104":{"dur":1,"text":"- So, you're a girl from the Midwest,"},"105":{"dur":1,"text":"and now you're in Bangladesh."},"107":{"dur":1,"text":"How did that all happen?"},"108":{"dur":2,"text":"- I wish I knew."},"110":{"dur":2,"text":"It certainly wasn't intentional."},"113":{"dur":2,"text":"You know, I didn't grow up\ndreaming of living in Bangladesh,"},"115":{"dur":3,"text":"or living overseas, or\nworking in public health."},"119":{"dur":3,"text":"Things unfolded in such a way that"},"122":{"dur":4,"text":"I discovered that my passion\nwas of global public health."},"126":{"dur":2,"text":"But that happened quite by accident."},"129":{"dur":3,"text":"In my, so right after undergraduate,"},"132":{"dur":1,"text":"I worked in the publishing industry in"},"133":{"dur":2,"text":"Chicago for five years."},"136":{"dur":1,"text":"And then I decided I\nneeded something more,"},"138":{"dur":2,"text":"needed to add some value to the world."},"141":{"dur":1,"text":"So, I joined the Peace Corps,"},"142":{"dur":2,"text":"and they sent me to Madagascar\nand they assigned me to"},"145":{"dur":3,"text":"be a community health educator."},"148":{"dur":2,"text":"I didn't know such a thing existed."},"150":{"dur":3,"text":"But I was fortunate, I loved it."},"153":{"dur":2,"text":"It's true what they say about\ntoughest job you'll ever love"},"156":{"dur":2,"text":"(mumbles) but it was a fabulous experience"},"159":{"dur":1,"text":"and I discovered my passion."},"161":{"dur":1,"text":"So, when I went there,\nI thought it would be"},"163":{"dur":2,"text":"something fun to do for awhile,"},"165":{"dur":3,"text":"but it turned into a whole\nnew career path for me."},"168":{"dur":1,"text":"And here I am."},"169":{"dur":3,"text":"So, since then, you know\njust follow the opportunities"},"173":{"dur":1,"text":"as they arise."},"174":{"dur":2,"text":"- [Joan] So on that first\nassignment in the Peace Corps,"},"177":{"dur":3,"text":"what were you told you would be doing?"},"180":{"dur":1,"text":"Or how did you integrate yourself into"},"182":{"dur":3,"text":"the community so you could have\nthose deeper conversations?"},"185":{"dur":0,"text":"- Right."},"186":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, I mean the first\nthing you have to do is"},"187":{"dur":1,"text":"learn how to speak the language"},"189":{"dur":2,"text":"because I think in my town,\nthere was one English-speaker"},"192":{"dur":3,"text":"and maybe 10 who could\nput together some French."},"195":{"dur":3,"text":"So, you have to spend time\nlearning the local language."},"199":{"dur":2,"text":"Which means, at the beginning,\nyou feel like you're not"},"201":{"dur":1,"text":"doing very much."},"203":{"dur":2,"text":"But that's your job, is\nto learn the language"},"205":{"dur":2,"text":"and become part of the community"},"207":{"dur":2,"text":"and earn the trust of the community."},"210":{"dur":3,"text":"And once you do that, then\nthe work will come eventually."},"213":{"dur":2,"text":"There was a project there,"},"216":{"dur":2,"text":"maternal and child survival project,"},"218":{"dur":2,"text":"that actually requested a volunteer."},"221":{"dur":1,"text":"And so I was fortunate to work with them,"},"223":{"dur":1,"text":"and we trained peer educators,"},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"so mothers and fathers\nof small children on"},"227":{"dur":2,"text":"things like preventing diarrheal diseases,"},"230":{"dur":3,"text":"and you know, family\nplanning, and breast feeding,"},"233":{"dur":2,"text":"and basic things."},"235":{"dur":3,"text":"But that makes a big difference\nin this kind of a setting."},"239":{"dur":2,"text":"- And you had not been\ntrained as a nurse, you had--"},"241":{"dur":1,"text":"- Oh, no, no."},"242":{"dur":1,"text":"- Any medical training at all?"},"244":{"dur":1,"text":"- Not at all."},"245":{"dur":1,"text":"No, I'm not a clinician by any stretch."},"247":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, but it's not technical stuff."},"249":{"dur":2,"text":"It's very, very simple and very basic,"},"251":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's really the communication,"},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's the integrating\nwith the community,"},"255":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's the earning the trust."},"258":{"dur":4,"text":"And being able to adapt\nand work and succeed"},"263":{"dur":4,"text":"in a culture that's very\ndifferent from what I grew up in."},"267":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's what I loved."},"269":{"dur":2,"text":"- So, there was Madagascar?"},"271":{"dur":1,"text":"And then, somewhere along the way you"},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"ended up working in\nBurundi, and Uganda and--"},"275":{"dur":1,"text":"- I did."},"276":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, immediately after\nMadagascar, I was in Tanzania"},"280":{"dur":1,"text":"for about four years."},"281":{"dur":3,"text":"And there I was working on\na national, multi-media,"},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"entertainment education initiative."},"288":{"dur":2,"text":"We published magazines,\nwe had a television show,"},"290":{"dur":3,"text":"we had a website targeting young people,"},"294":{"dur":3,"text":"mostly around HIV prevention\nand healthy lifestyles."},"297":{"dur":2,"text":"But you can't only talk about HIV,"},"300":{"dur":2,"text":"or you can't just publish an HIV magazine."},"302":{"dur":3,"text":"So what we did is we packaged it"},"306":{"dur":2,"text":"in the context of young peoples' lives."},"308":{"dur":1,"text":"They're the things that\nthey're interested in,"},"310":{"dur":3,"text":"of music and fashion and\nrelationships and education"},"313":{"dur":4,"text":"and employment and then\nyou earn their trust."},"318":{"dur":4,"text":"Then when they see their\nown interests reflected"},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"in the media products we were developing,"},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"you become their trusted\nsource of information."},"327":{"dur":1,"text":"And then they listen to it."},"328":{"dur":2,"text":"And then they listen about HIV."},"331":{"dur":3,"text":"But you have to put it in a way that"},"334":{"dur":3,"text":"resonates with your audience."},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"So that's what I was doing in Tanzania."},"340":{"dur":3,"text":"Burundi and Uganda and\nRwanda, that came later."},"344":{"dur":1,"text":"That was a shorter term assignment when"},"345":{"dur":1,"text":"I spent several years consulting."},"347":{"dur":3,"text":"And CARE Norway sent me to\nthese three countries to"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"work with community-based\nactivists who are"},"354":{"dur":3,"text":"working to fight against\ngender-based violence."},"358":{"dur":2,"text":"And they needed some tools to do that."},"360":{"dur":3,"text":"So they hired me to come\nover and to meet them,"},"363":{"dur":1,"text":"learn about what they were doing,"},"365":{"dur":1,"text":"what they were trying to accomplish,"},"366":{"dur":3,"text":"and help them to create some tools."},"369":{"dur":0,"text":"- Yeah, and when you say tools,"},"370":{"dur":1,"text":"these are communications tools--"},"372":{"dur":2,"text":"- These are sort of,\nforgive that if this sounds"},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"like a crass term, but\nsort of a marketing plan."},"376":{"dur":2,"text":"How do you distribute your message?"},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"How can you be heard where\nyou need to be heard?"},"381":{"dur":2,"text":"It's whether you're selling\na product or you're selling"},"384":{"dur":4,"text":"a healthy behavior, or a certain\nidea about gender equity,"},"388":{"dur":3,"text":"it's all marketing and the\nconcepts definitely cross over."},"392":{"dur":1,"text":"It's all communication."},"394":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's understanding your audience,"},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"seeing things from their perspective,"},"398":{"dur":2,"text":"putting yourselves in their shoes,"},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"and meeting their needs in that way."},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not that I come in\nand I have a solution"},"405":{"dur":1,"text":"and I'm fixing what's wrong."},"407":{"dur":0,"text":"Not at all."},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"My job is as a facilitator,"},"411":{"dur":4,"text":"to help identify what are the\nstrengths in this community"},"415":{"dur":1,"text":"that are already there."},"416":{"dur":3,"text":"Because no matter how\nimpoverished it may appear to be,"},"420":{"dur":1,"text":"there's always some strength,"},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"there's always a place to start from."},"423":{"dur":1,"text":"So, where is that place?"},"425":{"dur":1,"text":"And what can the community do,"},"427":{"dur":1,"text":"how can they work together,"},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"first of all to identify\nand to articulate what"},"430":{"dur":4,"text":"is it that we want to see\nimproved, and what can we do?"},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"So, health communication,\nit's not just about"},"436":{"dur":3,"text":"delivering information or\ndisseminating messages,"},"440":{"dur":4,"text":"it's about facilitating and\nempowering and inspiring,"},"444":{"dur":4,"text":"and facilitating a peer-to-peer dialogue."},"450":{"dur":4,"text":"In my work now, part of\nwhat I see is people at the"},"454":{"dur":3,"text":"central level that want to,\nthat think they have all the"},"457":{"dur":4,"text":"answers, and all I need to do\nis just give the information"},"462":{"dur":1,"text":"and things will be better."},"464":{"dur":1,"text":"People aren't listening to me."},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"That's the problem."},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"When in fact, this one-way,\ntop-down communication"},"470":{"dur":3,"text":"is the least effective"},"475":{"dur":3,"text":"in most countries, we'll put it that way."},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"So, to think about health communication,"},"481":{"dur":1,"text":"and to think about social change,"},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"and behavior change, as\nmore as of a dialogue,"},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"and more of a, you know,\nhow can you inspire that"},"489":{"dur":4,"text":"internal motivation\nrather than expect them to"},"493":{"dur":3,"text":"be motivated to change\nfor some external reason."},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"- Well, of course, you've\nbeen talking about this"},"499":{"dur":1,"text":"as you've explained,\nwhat you've been doing,"},"501":{"dur":1,"text":"but I wanted to ask you\na very direct question"},"503":{"dur":1,"text":"about culture."},"504":{"dur":1,"text":"We talk about gender-based violence,"},"506":{"dur":1,"text":"or we talk about HIV."},"507":{"dur":3,"text":"This is about more than healthcare"},"510":{"dur":3,"text":"and keeping someone from\nbeing beaten in their home."},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"It really touches every\npart of how we interact as"},"517":{"dur":2,"text":"families, how we're\nraised as boys and girls,"},"520":{"dur":0,"text":"and all the rest of it."},"521":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, in all these various countries"},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"you've been working in, you've faced"},"525":{"dur":2,"text":"different cultural challenges, I suspect."},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"And I know you've been working with NGOs,"},"530":{"dur":4,"text":"so there is a framework\naround much of what you do."},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"But what kind of pushback do you get from"},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"individuals who don't see\nthings the same way you do?"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"- Oh, well, that happens all the time."},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's to be expected\nin any country really."},"543":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, if you think of the\ndiffusion of innovation,"},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"there's always gonna\nbe people on this end,"},"551":{"dur":3,"text":"the laggards who, you're\nnever going to convince them."},"554":{"dur":1,"text":"So don't waste your time."},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"You spend your time\nworking with the people who"},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"are willing to at least\nmeet you part of the way."},"562":{"dur":4,"text":"And if it's hard to find\nthat starting point,"},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"you may have to spend some\ntime and invest the time"},"570":{"dur":1,"text":"to look for it."},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"There's always some common ground."},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"Always."},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"It may not be obvious, and you may have to"},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"have some conversations\nand do some exercises,"},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"but once you identify that common ground,"},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"then you have a foundation\nthat you can work from."},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Joan] I can only imagine\nthat you're received"},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"very warmly by most\npeople when they meet you,"},"590":{"dur":1,"text":"because you have an open face."},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"You have a big smile."},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"You have an I just want to be your friend,"},"596":{"dur":1,"text":"kind of way about you,"},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"and we haven't met before\ntoday but I think that's"},"600":{"dur":3,"text":"an important element when\nyou come into a space"},"604":{"dur":1,"text":"that is not your space."},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"And I suspect, well, tell me how it works."},"607":{"dur":3,"text":"Do you try to be sort of\nunobtrusive for a little while,"},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"let people just kind of see you quietly"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"walking down the street before\nthey figure out who you are"},"615":{"dur":2,"text":"and why you're there or?"},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"- I think that's the best approach."},"620":{"dur":2,"text":"Quite honestly, to again, you can come in"},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"and earn their respect."},"624":{"dur":3,"text":"And when you come in\nand start giving orders"},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"and acting like you are thinking that"},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"you have all the answers and that"},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"now the expert has arrived,"},"635":{"dur":2,"text":"you can all just listen to me."},"637":{"dur":1,"text":"That's not the way to do it, not at all."},"639":{"dur":2,"text":"No, so, you know, when I\nthink back to Peace Corps,"},"642":{"dur":2,"text":"the first, while you're\nlearning the language,"},"644":{"dur":2,"text":"getting to know people,\nplaying with the children,"},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"talking to the people at the market."},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"The entire community,\nnot just the people that"},"652":{"dur":2,"text":"you think you want to work with."},"654":{"dur":1,"text":"But everybody, the entire\ncommunity, needs to"},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"know that you're there for them."},"658":{"dur":1,"text":"They may not fully understand it,"},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"because I was the first\nvolunteer to be in this town."},"663":{"dur":1,"text":"So I had to explain, what's a Peace Corps,"},"665":{"dur":0,"text":"and why are you here"},"666":{"dur":3,"text":"and why are you so far\naway from your family."},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"But it works,"},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"because you've put in the time,"},"674":{"dur":3,"text":"you've put in the efforts\nand they respect that."},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"And of course, I come in with\na very deep respect for them."},"680":{"dur":3,"text":"It's not that I'm there to save them."},"684":{"dur":1,"text":"That's not it."},"686":{"dur":3,"text":"Again, I'm there as a\nfacilitator to see what I can do,"},"689":{"dur":3,"text":"with my education and my training,"},"692":{"dur":3,"text":"to improve the health outcomes, yeah."},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"- So, let's talk a little\nbit about your work now"},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"in Bangladesh."},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"Because, I understand\nthat you have developed,"},"702":{"dur":3,"text":"as Sue mentioned, you've\ndeveloped some eTools,"},"705":{"dur":2,"text":"some digital materials that"},"707":{"dur":2,"text":"can be used at the household level."},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"So, the government, the Ministry of"},"712":{"dur":1,"text":"Health and Family Welfare, actually has"},"714":{"dur":4,"text":"a very big army of these field workers,"},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"who go out to the\ncommunities, and they went"},"721":{"dur":1,"text":"door-to-door and they talked to people,"},"723":{"dur":2,"text":"they counseled people, sometimes\nthey sit in the clinics,"},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"sometimes they have courtyard meetings."},"727":{"dur":2,"text":"But they're on the ground and there are"},"730":{"dur":1,"text":"something like 45,000 of them."},"732":{"dur":1,"text":"So there's a good number."},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"But they, you know, they get training,"},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"they get trained once when they're hired,"},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"and then after that there's no refresher,"},"742":{"dur":1,"text":"there's no material."},"743":{"dur":1,"text":"They're supposed to have material."},"745":{"dur":1,"text":"People at the central level think that"},"747":{"dur":1,"text":"they have material, you know, flip charts"},"748":{"dur":1,"text":"and brochures and things."},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"But they don't."},"752":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, to address this\nchallenge and to give them"},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"some tools to do their\njobs a little bit better,"},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"we assembled a digital library"},"763":{"dur":4,"text":"of just different printed\nand audio visual materials."},"767":{"dur":1,"text":"We didn't create anything new."},"769":{"dur":2,"text":"These were things that had\nbeen created by the government,"},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"and other NGOs and the UN organizations."},"775":{"dur":1,"text":"We compiled them."},"777":{"dur":2,"text":"They went through a two-step process."},"779":{"dur":2,"text":"Number one, to make sure\nthat they're accurate"},"781":{"dur":1,"text":"and reflect current government policy."},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"Number two, we showed\nthem to the field workers"},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"and said is this something you\nwould use in your counseling?"},"789":{"dur":1,"text":"Because it's for them."},"790":{"dur":1,"text":"It doesn't matter if I\nthink it's a good piece."},"792":{"dur":1,"text":"They need to think it's a good piece."},"794":{"dur":2,"text":"So, we put it into a digital format,"},"796":{"dur":2,"text":"we call it an eTool kit."},"798":{"dur":3,"text":"It's color-coded,"},"801":{"dur":3,"text":"it's very visual and it's colorful."},"805":{"dur":2,"text":"There's no typing involved."},"807":{"dur":1,"text":"You can't even try to search something."},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"So we designed it in such a way that"},"811":{"dur":3,"text":"even if they'd never\nused a computer before,"},"814":{"dur":2,"text":"they could figure it out pretty easily."},"817":{"dur":3,"text":"There's just titles\nand there's categories,"},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"and if something needs\nto be in two categories,"},"822":{"dur":2,"text":"it's in two, to make it\nas easy as possible to"},"825":{"dur":1,"text":"find what they're looking for."},"826":{"dur":1,"text":"Very intuitive."},"828":{"dur":0,"text":"And they loved it."},"829":{"dur":3,"text":"The field workers loved\nit, the clients loved it,"},"832":{"dur":2,"text":"it was something new and interesting."},"834":{"dur":4,"text":"The field workers said to\nus, you know, before, people"},"838":{"dur":2,"text":"would ask us questions and\nwe'd give them an answer,"},"840":{"dur":2,"text":"but we weren't really sure\nit was the right answer."},"843":{"dur":3,"text":"But now that we can have\nthis and we can refer to it,"},"847":{"dur":1,"text":"we're more confident and we know that"},"849":{"dur":1,"text":"we're giving them the good information."},"850":{"dur":3,"text":"Which increases the\nconfidence of the clients,"},"854":{"dur":3,"text":"so there the status of\nthe field workers goes up,"},"858":{"dur":2,"text":"and then the clients are\ngetting integrated information."},"860":{"dur":1,"text":"You know, before you'd get one person who"},"862":{"dur":1,"text":"talks and coming to the house"},"864":{"dur":2,"text":"and talking about family planning,"},"866":{"dur":1,"text":"and someone else will come"},"867":{"dur":2,"text":"and talk about other health topics."},"869":{"dur":3,"text":"But with the eTool kits,\nwith all of the, you know,"},"873":{"dur":2,"text":"there's the health, the family\nplanning, and nutrition,"},"875":{"dur":2,"text":"it's all integrated in one place."},"877":{"dur":1,"text":"They get that integrated information that"},"879":{"dur":2,"text":"a household, that a family is looking for."},"881":{"dur":2,"text":"They don't make the distinction between"},"884":{"dur":2,"text":"health and family planning and nutrition"},"886":{"dur":3,"text":"the same way that people\nat the central level do."},"890":{"dur":2,"text":"They're just, they're a family\ntrying to, you know, they"},"892":{"dur":2,"text":"want to be prosperous, they\nwant their kids to succeed,"},"894":{"dur":1,"text":"that's how they, they're thinking in"},"896":{"dur":2,"text":"a more holistic manner."},"898":{"dur":4,"text":"So to deliver services\nin a fragmented manner"},"902":{"dur":1,"text":"doesn't serve them well."},"904":{"dur":2,"text":"So they really enjoyed the tool kit, too,"},"907":{"dur":2,"text":"because they could see\nthat there were things,"},"909":{"dur":2,"text":"colorful things, with pictures or videos."},"912":{"dur":3,"text":"And so, the counseling\nactually took more time,"},"915":{"dur":2,"text":"because the clients were\nasking more questions."},"918":{"dur":2,"text":"And they were getting\ntheir questions answered."},"920":{"dur":1,"text":"And so it was a lot of fun to see that"},"922":{"dur":2,"text":"actually happening in the field ."},"924":{"dur":2,"text":"- And so, how can you measure success"},"927":{"dur":1,"text":"or the effectiveness of it?"},"929":{"dur":1,"text":"You of course get feedback
