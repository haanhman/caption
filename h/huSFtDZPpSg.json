coming."},"15":{"dur":2,"text":"I really appreciate that\nspontaneous welcome."},"18":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you."},"19":{"dur":1,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: Ben,\nyou've written a book."},"21":{"dur":0,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: It's very good."},"22":{"dur":1,"text":"I finished it last night."},"23":{"dur":2,"text":"It's about the search for\nextraterrestrial life--"},"26":{"dur":0,"text":"BEN MILLER: Yes."},"27":{"dur":1,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: --what\nthat might look like--"},"28":{"dur":2,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: --and how we\nmight go about finding it."},"31":{"dur":1,"text":"BEN MILLER: Exactly."},"32":{"dur":1,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: Why did\nyou write the book?"},"34":{"dur":1,"text":"BEN MILLER: I think it was a\nbit of a midlife crisis thing,"},"36":{"dur":0,"text":"really."},"37":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean, I just got very\ninto-- my scientific training"},"41":{"dur":2,"text":"was in physics."},"44":{"dur":1,"text":"I've just always loved science."},"46":{"dur":2,"text":"It's not something\nI've done as a career,"},"48":{"dur":1,"text":"it's always been a hobby."},"49":{"dur":3,"text":"It's just something I just\nreally get a lot of enjoyment"},"52":{"dur":2,"text":"from and a lot of pleasure from."},"54":{"dur":2,"text":"And this book started\nwith a previous book."},"57":{"dur":2,"text":"I wrote a book called \"It's\nNot Rocket Science,\" which"},"59":{"dur":3,"text":"is basically-- I felt there\nweren't any books out there"},"63":{"dur":5,"text":"which described the best\nbits of science for people"},"68":{"dur":4,"text":"without-- for bright people\nwithout-- a scientific training"},"72":{"dur":0,"text":"or background."},"73":{"dur":3,"text":"So I thought, well, would\nit be possible to write"},"76":{"dur":2,"text":"about all the bits of\nscience that I love"},"79":{"dur":3,"text":"and explain it in\na way that, say,"},"82":{"dur":3,"text":"a creative person with a\nreally good arts degree"},"86":{"dur":4,"text":"could maybe pick up and\nreally get access to science."},"90":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is digging deep\ninto that particular topic"},"93":{"dur":1,"text":"of astrobiology and [INAUDIBLE]."},"94":{"dur":0,"text":"BEN MILLER: Yeah."},"95":{"dur":4,"text":"So when I was doing that\nbook, I came across-- partly,"},"100":{"dur":2,"text":"I wanted to do some\nstuff about DNA"},"103":{"dur":3,"text":"and the latest\nadvances in biology."},"107":{"dur":2,"text":"And that just got me\nreally interested in life,"},"109":{"dur":2,"text":"you know, the physics\nof life, what is life."},"112":{"dur":3,"text":"I came across a brilliant\nbook by Erwin Schrodinger"},"116":{"dur":5,"text":"called \"What is Life,\"\nwhich talked, really, about,"},"121":{"dur":5,"text":"how does life fit in with the\nsecond law of thermodynamics."},"126":{"dur":2,"text":"One of the topics I hadn't\ncovered in the first book"},"129":{"dur":2,"text":"was entropy and the second\nlaw of thermodynamics."},"131":{"dur":2,"text":"So I thought, wow, is that\nsomething that I could try"},"133":{"dur":4,"text":"and-- is that something I\ncould try and do justice to."},"137":{"dur":3,"text":"Also, I just think\naliens is a funny topic."},"140":{"dur":4,"text":"There's something\nnaturally amusing about it,"},"144":{"dur":2,"text":"sometimes intentionally,\nsometimes unintentionally."},"147":{"dur":3,"text":"And at the beginning of the\nbook, whereas, the first book,"},"151":{"dur":1,"text":"I was really in\nmy comfort zone, I"},"152":{"dur":2,"text":"was writing about things that\nI knew quite well, this book,"},"154":{"dur":2,"text":"I didn't know any of this\nstuff when I started out."},"157":{"dur":6,"text":"So it was also like-- for me--\nit was like my dream adult"},"164":{"dur":1,"text":"education course, really."},"165":{"dur":2,"text":"So I went to meet all\nthese amazing people,"},"167":{"dur":1,"text":"incredible people."},"169":{"dur":5,"text":"And to begin with, I had a real\nembarrassment about asking them"},"175":{"dur":2,"text":"about-- one of the first\npeople I went to meet"},"177":{"dur":6,"text":"was the head of the UNOOSA,\nthe UN Office of Outer Space"},"184":{"dur":2,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: She's our\nambassador if aliens come down."},"187":{"dur":1,"text":"BEN MILLER: That's right."},"188":{"dur":3,"text":"So the idea-- and this\nwas sort of where,"},"191":{"dur":1,"text":"partly, the idea\nfor the book came"},"193":{"dur":4,"text":"from-- the idea is that\nif aliens were to land,"},"197":{"dur":3,"text":"the UN needs to have a response."},"200":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean, this is literally like\nif they landed in a space ship"},"205":{"dur":3,"text":"and came out and held\na press conference."},"209":{"dur":3,"text":"There would have to be\nsomebody-- there's somebody"},"212":{"dur":4,"text":"whose job it is, at the UN,\nto liaise with the aliens."},"217":{"dur":1,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: That's\nnot her only job."},"218":{"dur":3,"text":"BEN MILLER: That's\nnot her only job."},"222":{"dur":2,"text":"She's also got to find ghosts."},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"No, it's not her only job."},"227":{"dur":5,"text":"That office, they basically keep\ntrack of all the satellites."},"232":{"dur":1,"text":"Basically, if you want\nto put a satellite up,"},"234":{"dur":1,"text":"you have to talk\nto UNOOSA first."},"236":{"dur":3,"text":"And yeah, so I went to\nmeet her and I felt so--"},"239":{"dur":2,"text":"and the story is in the\nbook-- I felt so embarrassed."},"242":{"dur":6,"text":"I was going to this very eminent\nMalaysian physicist who'd"},"248":{"dur":2,"text":"set up the Malaysian\nspace program"},"251":{"dur":1,"text":"and had launched the\nfirst Malaysian satellite"},"253":{"dur":1,"text":"and was now the head of UNOOSA."},"254":{"dur":2,"text":"And I went to have this thing."},"257":{"dur":1,"text":"And I said, well,\nso could we just"},"259":{"dur":1,"text":"talk about this aliens thing?"},"260":{"dur":4,"text":"And I said, is it true\nthat if aliens land,"},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"then you're the\ndesignated spokesman"},"267":{"dur":2,"text":"on behalf of the human race?"},"270":{"dur":5,"text":"And she said, yeah, it's\npretty cool, isn't it?"},"275":{"dur":3,"text":"And I just had the most\nbrilliant chat with her"},"279":{"dur":0,"text":"where we got on."},"280":{"dur":3,"text":"Quickly, you start\ntalking about life."},"286":{"dur":4,"text":"You very quickly get on to\nwhat makes life so special."},"293":{"dur":4,"text":"We very quickly got onto\neven spiritual subjects."},"298":{"dur":3,"text":"You know, what does it all mean."},"301":{"dur":1,"text":"What are we here for?"},"302":{"dur":3,"text":"And why do we want\nto talk to aliens?"},"306":{"dur":3,"text":"And I began to\nrealize that there"},"310":{"dur":3,"text":"was real science, that you\ncould go-- what you could do"},"313":{"dur":5,"text":"is you could take all the\nlatest stuff that we had found"},"319":{"dur":3,"text":"in astronomy, and you could\ntake all of the latest stuff"},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"that we had found in\nevolutionary biology,"},"326":{"dur":1,"text":"and you could put\nit all together,"},"327":{"dur":3,"text":"and you could do a pretty good\njob, really, of finding out"},"331":{"dur":4,"text":"what life on Earth could tell\nyou about any other life that"},"336":{"dur":7,"text":"And that's in every respect--\nhow it might get its start,"},"344":{"dur":4,"text":"what life is in physical\nterms-- you know,"},"348":{"dur":5,"text":"is there any-- it's\na huge subject."},"353":{"dur":3,"text":"How would you communicate with\nit if you could communicate?"},"356":{"dur":4,"text":"Just say, for\nexample, we did manage"},"360":{"dur":1,"text":"to receive some kind of signal."},"362":{"dur":1,"text":"How would we know\nit was a signal?"},"366":{"dur":1,"text":"Could we decode it?"},"367":{"dur":3,"text":"If we couldn't decode\nit, what information"},"371":{"dur":2,"text":"could we get from it?"},"374":{"dur":2,"text":"And it becomes a\nreally-- It's just--"},"376":{"dur":1,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: I\nthink, on that topic--"},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: --there was a\npoint where you were talking"},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"about Zipf's law and dolphins--\nand we'll move on to the that--"},"381":{"dur":0,"text":"BEN MILLER: Ah."},"382":{"dur":0,"text":"BEN MILLER: Oh my god."},"383":{"dur":1,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: But\nessentially, even"},"384":{"dur":2,"text":"if you can't understand\nwhat is in a signal,"},"387":{"dur":3,"text":"you could prove that it\nhad intelligence behind it."},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"BEN MILLER: Well, yes, I imagine\nthat information theory will"},"393":{"dur":1,"text":"be bread and butter to\na lot of people here,"},"395":{"dur":1,"text":"but it was very new to me."},"397":{"dur":4,"text":"And the idea that you\ncould-- basically,"},"402":{"dur":3,"text":"the mathematical\nproperties of language"},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"are there whether or\nnot you can understand"},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"what the message says or not."},"410":{"dur":4,"text":"So you could know\nthat something--"},"414":{"dur":1,"text":"you can't know that\nit is language,"},"416":{"dur":1,"text":"that it is\ncommunication, but you"},"418":{"dur":4,"text":"can see whether it has the\nproperties of language."},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can see how\ncomplex a language"},"424":{"dur":3,"text":"it could possibly\nbe without knowing"},"428":{"dur":1,"text":"the content, the message."},"429":{"dur":1,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: If you analyze\nthe speech patterns of a child,"},"431":{"dur":1,"text":"they're less complicated\nthan the speech"},"432":{"dur":0,"text":"BEN MILLER: Exactly."},"433":{"dur":1,"text":"So they did this\nbrilliant thing."},"434":{"dur":6,"text":"So one of the stories in\nthe book is about how--"},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"and this was really news to me."},"441":{"dur":3,"text":"I hadn't realized that we think\nof ourselves as very special."},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"Homo sapiens, we\nthink of ourselves"},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"as being really extraordinary."},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"We are intelligent."},"450":{"dur":7,"text":"It began with the domestication\nof animals and farming."},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"And then we built civilizations."},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"And then we discovered language."},"461":{"dur":3,"text":"And we have this story\nthat we tell ourselves"},"465":{"dur":3,"text":"where we are completely\nunique on the planet."},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's really,\nreally interesting"},"470":{"dur":3,"text":"to discover that all\nthose traits are there"},"474":{"dur":1,"text":"in other species."},"475":{"dur":2,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: You talk about\nfarming as something ants do."},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"BEN MILLER: Ants, yeah."},"480":{"dur":3,"text":"There's a South\nAmerican ant that's"},"483":{"dur":5,"text":"been farming, fungus farming,\nfor about 6 million years."},"488":{"dur":2,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: They treat\nthe fungus with antibiotics."},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"BEN MILLER: They treat the\nfungus with antibiotics,"},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"they farm it, they cultivate\nit, they use it as food."},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"It's farming."},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"You can't argue with it."},"498":{"dur":1,"text":"It's definitely farming."},"504":{"dur":3,"text":"The crow family-- I met\nthis fabulous professor"},"507":{"dur":2,"text":"at the University of Cambridge\nwho's done a lot of work with"},"510":{"dur":4,"text":"crows and has shown that\ncrows have cognitive abilities"},"514":{"dur":4,"text":"not just on a par with\nchimpanzees, but in some cases,"},"519":{"dur":4,"text":"better than chimpanzees."},"523":{"dur":5,"text":"And you start to form\nthis picture of-- it"},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"starts to become very,\nvery interesting."},"530":{"dur":5,"text":"And you see our own\nvery lucky position"},"535":{"dur":1,"text":"as being more of an\naccident, really,"},"537":{"dur":6,"text":"than a vital last step in a long\nchain of progressive evolution."},"544":{"dur":1,"text":"It's really interesting."},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: And you call\nout the intelligence--"},"547":{"dur":3,"text":"so, the example of convergence,\nwhere different elements come"},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"about through entirely\ndifferent evolutionary paths--"},"553":{"dur":0,"text":"BEN MILLER: That's\na great example."},"554":{"dur":1,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: --and\nintelligence being one of those."},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"So again, new to me was this\nidea of convergent evolution."},"560":{"dur":3,"text":"We've all heard of\ndivergent evolution."},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"Organisms speciate over\ntime, and we end up"},"566":{"dur":3,"text":"with a planet that's full of\nall kinds of different things."},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"But there's also\nconvergent evolution."},"573":{"dur":6,"text":"So things like wings have\nevolved independently,"},"579":{"dur":2,"text":"maybe half a dozen times,\nin different species,"},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"completely unrelated."},"584":{"dur":4,"text":"In fact, convergence is such\na problem for biologists"},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"that many mistakes\nhave been made"},"590":{"dur":5,"text":"since the 19th century,\nwhere one creature from one"},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"part of the planet looks so like\na creature from another part"},"598":{"dur":1,"text":"of the planet, they\nbelieve they're related"},"600":{"dur":3,"text":"and only later find out that\nthey are on a completely"},"603":{"dur":1,"text":"different evolutionary path."},"605":{"dur":1,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: I was\nreading, this morning,"},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"that carnivorous plants have\nevolved nine times in five"},"609":{"dur":1,"text":"different orders."},"611":{"dur":0,"text":"It's [INAUDIBLE]."},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"BEN MILLER: And\nthis is everywhere."},"613":{"dur":5,"text":"So teeth, eyes-- our eyes are\nremarkably similar, in design,"},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"to octopus eyes, for example."},"620":{"dur":5,"text":"But obviously, the common\nancestor of us and the octopus"},"625":{"dur":6,"text":"is-- you're going right back\nto the Cambrian explosion"},"632":{"dur":3,"text":"540 million years ago."},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"It's really striking."},"637":{"dur":3,"text":"And intelligence--\nthere is intelligence"},"641":{"dur":6,"text":"in-- arguably, intelligence in--\ndolphins, in crows, in octopus."},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"You could include dogs, cats."},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"There's all kinds of\ndifferent creatures."},"653":{"dur":1,"text":"Of all of those,\nthe most interesting"},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"is probably octopuses\nand mammals,"},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"because again, it's\nsuch a long way back."},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"But even with crows,\nfor a common ancestor"},"663":{"dur":3,"text":"between crows and us,\nyou've got to go back"},"666":{"dur":7,"text":"to what they call an amniote,\nsomething that was basically"},"673":{"dur":1,"text":"just laying eggs on land."},"675":{"dur":1,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: Well, let's\ngo right back [INAUDIBLE]."},"676":{"dur":2,"text":"So you open the book\nwith extremophiles--"},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"so, bacteria in a rock here?"},"681":{"dur":1,"text":"BEN MILLER: There's\nbeen three-- what"},"683":{"dur":6,"text":"was happening is all-- three\ndifferent areas of science"},"689":{"dur":3,"text":"are all converging on\nthe same point, really."},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"We've had the Kepler\nSpace Telescope,"},"694":{"dur":4,"text":"which has shown us that\nEarth-like planets are common."},"699":{"dur":1,"text":"So whereas 20\nyears ago, we might"},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"have believed there\nwere no other planets"},"702":{"dur":1,"text":"outside the solar\nsystem, we now know"},"704":{"dur":1,"text":"Earth-like planets are common."},"705":{"dur":5,"text":"And maybe something like\none in 1,000 solar systems"},"711":{"dur":3,"text":"is like our own, with\na big, cold Jupiter,"},"714":{"dur":4,"text":"terrestrial planets the right\ndistance from a Sun-like star"},"719":{"dur":3,"text":"to have water on their surface."},"722":{"dur":1,"text":"We know that these\nthings are common."},"724":{"dur":1,"text":"So that was one area."},"725":{"dur":3,"text":"There's another area, which was\nextremophiles, which has also"},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"been going in parallel, where\nwe've discovered that life"},"731":{"dur":6,"text":"on Earth is much more resilient,\ncreative, resourceful than we"},"738":{"dur":1,"text":"ever realized."},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"We thought that there was a\ncertain zone of temperatures,"},"743":{"dur":5,"text":"acidities, pressures, radiation\nlevels where life could exist."},"748":{"dur":2,"text":"And time and time again,\nwe've discovered that's wrong."},"750":{"dur":3,"text":"You always find some bacterium\nsomewhere, very, very happy"},"754":{"dur":2,"text":"to live in those conditions."},"757":{"dur":3,"text":"And then finally, there's\nbeen the advances-- again,"},"760":{"dur":1,"text":"this is all new to me,\nand it's really, really"},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"great stuff-- advances\nin evolutionary biology."},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"So we've now got some\nreally good theories that"},"767":{"dur":5,"text":"make an awful lot of\nsense, not the Darwin warm"},"773":{"dur":5,"text":"pond that you may heard\nof, but this idea that life"},"778":{"dur":3,"text":"began in alkaline\nhydrothermal vents."},"782":{"dur":3,"text":"Because you get a particularly\nunique situation there where"},"785":{"dur":1,"text":"you've got lots of\ntransition metals."},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"One thing we do know is\nthat life, as we know it,"},"789":{"dur":1,"text":"adores transition metals."},"791":{"dur":3,"text":"It kind of uses transition\nmetals as little batteries"},"794":{"dur":5,"text":"to borrow electrons from\nand pay electrons back"},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"when it suits it."},"801":{"dur":3,"text":"You have this great-- it's\nan electrochemical cell,"},"805":{"dur":6,"text":"basically, because the first\nsea waters were acidic."},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"And if you have an\nalkaline hydrothermal vent,"},"814":{"dur":3,"text":"you essentially get,\nacross the membrane,"},"818":{"dur":5,"text":"the semi-permeable membrane of\nthe bubbles inside the vent,"},"823":{"dur":2,"text":"these gel-like iron\nsulfide bubbles,"},"826":{"dur":2,"text":"you get this charge separation."},"829":{"dur":4,"text":"And that can be used to\ndrive-- as an energy source,"},"833":{"dur":4,"text":"to drive-- the formation\nof long-chain molecules."},"838":{"dur":6,"text":"So suddenly, so many\nmissing steps of the jigsaw"},"844":{"dur":3,"text":"are almost falling into place."},"847":{"dur":3,"text":"And you begin to have an\nexplanation for the beginning"},"851":{"dur":3,"text":"of life that sort of makes\nsense in physical, biological,"},"855":{"dur":1,"text":"and chemical terms."},"856":{"dur":1,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: So\nonce you have that--"},"858":{"dur":0,"text":"BEN MILLER: You've\ngot these three areas"},"859":{"dur":0,"text":"all coming together."},"860":{"dur":3,"text":"And now everyone's going,\nshit, there's life everywhere."},"863":{"dur":4,"text":"Because we think volcanic\nEarth-like planets"},"867":{"dur":2,"text":"would be common."},"869":{"dur":2,"text":"We know that life on Earth\nstarted, pretty much,"},"872":{"dur":2,"text":"out of the box."},"874":{"dur":3,"text":"The early Earth, as you know,\nwas pummeled with asteroids."},"878":{"dur":3,"text":"We're now pretty sure\nthat life started even"},"881":{"dur":2,"text":"during that period."},"883":{"dur":2,"text":"So that means that it couldn't\nreally have been in a pond."},"886":{"dur":2,"text":"A pond doesn't make sense\nif the Earth's getting"},"888":{"dur":0,"text":"pummeled with asteroids."},"889":{"dur":4,"text":"But a hydrothermal vent\non the ocean floor,"},"893":{"dur":2,"text":"that makes complete sense."},"895":{"dur":2,"text":"And we know that these\nplanets are common."},"898":{"dur":2,"text":"And we know that life\ncan exist in such"},"900":{"dur":3,"text":"an extraordinary wide\nvariety of conditions."},"904":{"dur":3,"text":"In fact, we're\nthe extremophiles."},"907":{"dur":3,"text":"This is the thing that\nwe've basically figured out,"},"910":{"dur":8,"text":"that microbial life didn't-- the\nfirst microbial life basically"},"919":{"dur":4,"text":"used metals as a food source."},"924":{"dur":3,"text":"Now all life, the\nlife that produces"},"927":{"dur":1,"text":"the food, the sugars\nthat we like to eat,"},"929":{"dur":3,"text":"rips electrons off water,\nstuffs them onto carbon dioxide"},"933":{"dur":1,"text":"to make long-chain molecules."},"934":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, the first life\nripped electrons just"},"938":{"dur":3,"text":"from metals that were\nin the vent, again,"},"941":{"dur":2,"text":"stuffed them onto carbon dioxide\nto make long-chain molecules."},"944":{"dur":2,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: So once you have\nthat early microbial life--"},"946":{"dur":2,"text":"which, let's assume that it's\nquite abundant throughout"},"949":{"dur":0,"text":"the universe--"},"950":{"dur":1,"text":"BEN MILLER: Yeah, this\nis the difficult bit."},"952":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah, this is the\ntricky bit, isn't it?"},"953":{"dur":1,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: How do\nyou get to complex life?"},"955":{"dur":3,"text":"BEN MILLER: So yeah,\nmicrobial life-- common."},"958":{"dur":2,"text":"Most reasonable people,\nI think-- certainly,"},"961":{"dur":0,"text":"once you've read--"},"962":{"dur":1,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: I'm\npretty convinced, yeah."},"963":{"dur":3,"text":"BEN MILLER: --this book--\nyou would believe, as I say,"},"967":{"dur":1,"text":"it works straight\nout of the box."},"969":{"dur":2,"text":"The trick is to get to\ncomplex, multicellular life."},"972":{"dur":3,"text":"Now multicellularity,\ncells just getting together"},"976":{"dur":4,"text":"to make life easier for\nthemselves, that has, again,"},"980":{"dur":2,"text":"emerged many, many times\nthroughout history of life"},"983":{"dur":4,"text":"And you get multicellularity\nwithin a billion,"},"988":{"dur":3,"text":"a billion and a half years\nof the first sign of life"},"991":{"dur":0,"text":"on Earth."},"992":{"dur":2,"text":"Complex multicellularity,\nwhere you get organisms"},"995":{"dur":6,"text":"with tissues-- and animals\nwould be the best example"},"1001":{"dur":6,"text":"of that-- that has emerged,\nmaybe, a handful of times."},"1008":{"dur":1,"text":"MALE SPEAKER: But\nstill more than once."},"1009":{"dur":2,"text":"BEN MILLER: There's\nthree types of algae,"},"1012":{"dur":3,"text":"there's basically fungi,\nand then there's us."},"1015":{"dur":6,"text":"So out of five\ntimes, only once has"},"1021":{"dur":2,"text":"any one of those branches\nproduced intelligent life."},"1024":{"dur":4,"text":"And the problem with\nall of those branches"},"1029":{"dur":5,"text":"is, if you follow\nthe family tree back,"},"1034":{"dur":1,"text":"you get to one, single event."},"1036":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is the\nreally worrying thing."},"1040":{"dur":3,"text":"You follow all complex\nmulticellular life back,"},"1044":{"dur":3,"text":"you get to one event, which\nwas the creation of one"},"1047":{"dur":1,"text":"eukaryotic cell."},"1048":{"dur":4,"text":"So basically, in the\nmost brief terms,"},"1053":{"dur":3,"text":"there were two types\nof single-celled life"},"1057":{"dur":2,"text":"on the Earth, the\nbacteria and the archaea."},"1060":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, again,\naround something"},"1062":{"dur":2,"text":"like a billion and a\nhalf years ago, there"},"1065":{"dur":5,"text":"was this one, single event\nwhere a bacteria attempted--"},"1070":{"dur":2,"text":"or, an
