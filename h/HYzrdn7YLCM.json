Will."},"51":{"dur":2,"text":"He was from North Texas."},"54":{"dur":1,"text":"He never knew his father very well,"},"55":{"dur":4,"text":"because his father left his mom\nwhile she was pregnant with him."},"61":{"dur":4,"text":"And so, he was destined\nto be raised by a single mom,"},"65":{"dur":1,"text":"which might have been all right"},"67":{"dur":4,"text":"except that this particular single mom\nwas a paranoid schizophrenic,"},"73":{"dur":2,"text":"and when Will was five years old,"},"76":{"dur":2,"text":"she tried to kill him\nwith a butcher knife."},"79":{"dur":5,"text":"She was taken away by authorities\nand placed in a psychiatric hospital,"},"84":{"dur":3,"text":"and so for the next several years\nWill lived with his older brother,"},"87":{"dur":3,"text":"until he committed suicide\nby shooting himself through the heart."},"92":{"dur":4,"text":"And after that Will bounced around\nfrom one family member to another,"},"97":{"dur":3,"text":"until, by the time he was nine years old,\nhe was essentially living on his own."},"102":{"dur":2,"text":"That morning that I was sitting\nwith Katya and Lincoln,"},"104":{"dur":6,"text":"I looked at my son, and I realized\nthat when my client, Will, was his age,"},"112":{"dur":2,"text":"he'd been living by himself for two years."},"116":{"dur":2,"text":"Will eventually joined a gang"},"119":{"dur":4,"text":"and committed a number\nof very serious crimes,"},"123":{"dur":2,"text":"including, most seriously of all,"},"127":{"dur":1,"text":"a horrible, tragic murder."},"130":{"dur":5,"text":"And Will was ultimately

client\nshouldn't have been executed,"},"147":{"dur":2,"text":"but what I would like to do today instead"},"150":{"dur":5,"text":"is talk about the death penalty\nin a way I've never done before,"},"155":{"dur":4,"text":"in a way that is\nentirely noncontroversial."},"160":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that's possible,"},"162":{"dur":4,"text":"because there is a corner\nof the death penalty debate --"},"166":{"dur":2,"text":"maybe the most important corner --"},"169":{"dur":2,"text":"where everybody agrees,"},"171":{"dur":4,"text":"where the most ardent\ndeath penalty supporters"},"176":{"dur":5,"text":"and the most vociferous abolitionists\nare on exactly the same page."},"182":{"dur":2,"text":"That's the corner I want to explore."},"186":{"dur":2,"text":"Before I do that, though,\nI want to spend a couple of minutes"},"189":{"dur":3,"text":"telling you how\na death penalty case unfolds,"},"193":{"dur":2,"text":"and then I want to tell you two lessons"},"195":{"dur":5,"text":"that I have learned over the last 20 years\nas a death penalty lawyer"},"200":{"dur":3,"text":"from watching well more\nthan a hundred cases unfold in this way."},"205":{"dur":4,"text":"You can think of a death penalty case\nas a story that has four chapters."},"211":{"dur":4,"text":"The first chapter of every case\nis exactly the same, and it is tragic."},"216":{"dur":3,"text":"It begins with the murder\nof an innocent human being,"},"220":{"dur":1,"text":"and it's followed by a trial"},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"where the murderer\nis convicted and sent to death row,"},"224":{"dur":3,"text":"and that death sentence is ultimately\nupheld by the state appellate court."},"229":{"dur":2,"text":"The second chapter consists\nof a complicated legal proceeding"},"232":{"dur":2,"text":"known as a state habeas corpus appeal."},"236":{"dur":2,"text":"The third chapter is an even\nmore complicated legal proceeding"},"239":{"dur":2,"text":"known as a federal\nhabeas corpus proceeding."},"241":{"dur":3,"text":"And the fourth chapter is one\nwhere a variety of things can happen."},"245":{"dur":2,"text":"The lawyers might file\na clemency petition,"},"248":{"dur":2,"text":"they might initiate\neven more complex litigation,"},"250":{"dur":2,"text":"or they might not do anything at all."},"253":{"dur":3,"text":"But that fourth chapter\nalways ends with an execution."},"258":{"dur":4,"text":"When I started representing\ndeath row inmates more than 20 years ago,"},"262":{"dur":2,"text":"people on death row\ndid not have a right to a lawyer"},"265":{"dur":3,"text":"in either the second\nor the fourth chapter of this story."},"268":{"dur":1,"text":"They were on their own."},"270":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact, it wasn't until the late 1980s"},"272":{"dur":3,"text":"that they acquired a right to a lawyer\nduring the third chapter of the story."},"277":{"dur":5,"text":"So what all of these death row inmates\nhad to do was rely on volunteer lawyers"},"283":{"dur":1,"text":"to handle their legal proceedings."},"285":{"dur":3,"text":"The problem is that there were\nway more guys on death row"},"289":{"dur":1,"text":"than there were lawyers"},"290":{"dur":3,"text":"who had both the interest\nand the expertise to work on these cases."},"294":{"dur":1,"text":"And so inevitably,"},"295":{"dur":3,"text":"lawyers drifted to cases\nthat were already in chapter four --"},"299":{"dur":1,"text":"that makes sense, of course."},"301":{"dur":1,"text":"Those are the cases that are most urgent;"},"303":{"dur":2,"text":"those are the guys\nwho are closest to being executed."},"305":{"dur":1,"text":"Some of these lawyers were successful;"},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"they managed to get\nnew trials for their clients."},"309":{"dur":2,"text":"Others of them managed\nto extend the lives of their clients,"},"312":{"dur":2,"text":"sometimes by years, sometimes by months."},"315":{"dur":2,"text":"But the one thing that didn't happen"},"318":{"dur":3,"text":"was that there was never\na serious and sustained decline"},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"in the number of annual\nexecutions in Texas."},"324":{"dur":1,"text":"In fact, as you can see from this graph,"},"326":{"dur":3,"text":"from the time that the Texas\nexecution apparatus got efficient"},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"in the mid- to late 1990s,"},"332":{"dur":1,"text":"there have only been a couple of years"},"334":{"dur":3,"text":"where the number of annual\nexecutions dipped below 20."},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"In a typical year in Texas,"},"340":{"dur":3,"text":"we're averaging about two people a month."},"344":{"dur":4,"text":"In some years in Texas,\nwe've executed close to 40 people,"},"348":{"dur":5,"text":"and this number has never significantly\ndeclined over the last 15 years."},"353":{"dur":3,"text":"And yet, at the same time\nthat we continue to execute"},"356":{"dur":2,"text":"about the same number\nof people every year,"},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"the number of people who we're\nsentencing to death on an annual basis"},"362":{"dur":1,"text":"has dropped rather steeply."},"365":{"dur":1,"text":"So we have this paradox,"},"367":{"dur":4,"text":"which is that the number\nof annual executions has remained high"},"371":{"dur":4,"text":"but the number of new\ndeath sentences has gone down."},"375":{"dur":1,"text":"Why is that?"},"376":{"dur":2,"text":"It can't be attributed\nto a decline in the murder rate,"},"379":{"dur":3,"text":"because the murder\nrate has not declined nearly so steeply"},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"as the red line\non that graph has gone down."},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"What has happened instead"},"388":{"dur":4,"text":"is that juries have started to sentence\nmore and more people to prison"},"393":{"dur":3,"text":"for the rest of their lives\nwithout the possibility of parole,"},"396":{"dur":2,"text":"rather than sending them\nto the execution chamber."},"400":{"dur":1,"text":"Why has that happened?"},"401":{"dur":3,"text":"It hasn't happened\nbecause of a dissolution"},"404":{"dur":2,"text":"of popular support for the death penalty."},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"Death penalty opponents\ntake great solace in the fact"},"410":{"dur":4,"text":"that death penalty support in Texas\nis at an all-time low."},"414":{"dur":2,"text":"Do you know what all-time low\nin Texas means?"},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"It means that it's in the low 60 percent."},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, that's really good\ncompared to the mid-1980s,"},"421":{"dur":2,"text":"when it was in excess of 80 percent,"},"424":{"dur":2,"text":"but we can't explain\nthe decline in death sentences"},"427":{"dur":3,"text":"and the affinity for life\nwithout the possibility of parole"},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"by an erosion of support\nfor the death penalty,"},"432":{"dur":2,"text":"because people still support\nthe death penalty."},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"What's happened to cause this phenomenon?"},"438":{"dur":4,"text":"What's happened is that lawyers\nwho represent death row inmates"},"443":{"dur":3,"text":"have shifted their focus\nto earlier and earlier chapters"},"446":{"dur":1,"text":"of the death penalty story."},"448":{"dur":3,"text":"So 25 years ago,\nthey focused on chapter four."},"452":{"dur":2,"text":"And they went from\nchapter four 25 years ago"},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"to chapter three in the late 1980s."},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"And they went from chapter three\nin the late 1980s"},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"to chapter two in the mid-1990s."},"462":{"dur":2,"text":"And beginning in the mid- to late 1990s,"},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"they began to focus\non chapter one of the story."},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, you might think\nthat this decline in death sentences"},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"and the increase\nin the number of life sentences"},"472":{"dur":1,"text":"is a good thing or a bad thing."},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"I don't want to have a conversation\nabout that today."},"476":{"dur":3,"text":"All that I want to tell you\nis that the reason that this has happened"},"480":{"dur":2,"text":"is because death penalty lawyers\nhave understood"},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"that the earlier you intervene in a case,"},"485":{"dur":3,"text":"the greater the likelihood that\nyou're going to save your client's life."},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"That's the first thing I've learned."},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"Here's the second thing I learned:"},"493":{"dur":3,"text":"My client Will was\nnot the exception to the rule;"},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"he was the rule."},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"I sometimes say, if you tell me\nthe name of a death row inmate --"},"505":{"dur":1,"text":"doesn't matter what state he's in,"},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"doesn't matter\nif I've ever met him before --"},"508":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll write his biography for you."},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"And eight out of 10 times,"},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"the details of that biography\nwill be more or less accurate."},"518":{"dur":3,"text":"And the reason for that is that 80 percent\nof the people on death row"},"522":{"dur":4,"text":"are people who came from the same sort\nof dysfunctional family that Will did."},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"Eighty percent of the people on death row"},"528":{"dur":3,"text":"are people who had exposure\nto the juvenile justice system."},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"That's the second lesson\nthat I've learned."},"536":{"dur":3,"text":"Now we're right on the cusp of that corner"},"540":{"dur":1,"text":"where everybody's going to agree."},"543":{"dur":1,"text":"People in this room might disagree"},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"about whether Will\nshould have been executed,"},"547":{"dur":2,"text":"but I think everybody would agree"},"550":{"dur":3,"text":"that the best possible\nversion of his story"},"553":{"dur":4,"text":"would be a story\nwhere no murder ever occurs."},"559":{"dur":1,"text":"How do we do that?"},"561":{"dur":4,"text":"When our son Lincoln was working\non that math problem two weeks ago,"},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"it was a big, gnarly problem."},"568":{"dur":3,"text":"And he was learning how,\nwhen you have a big old gnarly problem,"},"572":{"dur":3,"text":"sometimes the solution\nis to slice it into smaller problems."},"576":{"dur":1,"text":"That's what we do for most problems --"},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"in math, in physics,\neven in social policy --"},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"we slice them into smaller,\nmore manageable problems."},"583":{"dur":3,"text":"But every once in a while,\nas Dwight Eisenhower said,"},"587":{"dur":3,"text":"the way you solve a problem\nis to make it bigger."},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"The way we solve this problem"},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"is to make the issue\nof the death penalty bigger."},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"We have to say, all right."},"601":{"dur":4,"text":"We have these four chapters\nof a death penalty story,"},"606":{"dur":3,"text":"but what happens before that story begins?"},"610":{"dur":3,"text":"How can we intervene\nin the life of a murderer"},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"before he's a murderer?"},"617":{"dur":5,"text":"What options do we have\nto nudge that person off of the path"},"623":{"dur":3,"text":"that is going to lead\nto a result that everybody --"},"626":{"dur":2,"text":"death penalty supporters\nand death penalty opponents --"},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"still think is a bad result:"},"632":{"dur":1,"text":"the murder of an innocent human being?"},"637":{"dur":5,"text":"You know, sometimes people say\nthat something isn't rocket science."},"643":{"dur":3,"text":"And by that, what they mean\nis rocket science is really complicated"},"646":{"dur":3,"text":"and this problem that we're\ntalking about now is really simple."},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"Well that's rocket science;"},"651":{"dur":5,"text":"that's the mathematical expression\nfor the thrust created by a rocket."},"657":{"dur":3,"text":"What we're talking about today\nis just as complicated."},"661":{"dur":4,"text":"What we're talking about today\nis also rocket science."},"667":{"dur":4,"text":"My client Will and 80 percent\nof the people on death row"},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"had five chapters in their lives"},"675":{"dur":4,"text":"that came before the four chapters\nof the death penalty story."},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"I think of these five chapters\nas points of intervention,"},"682":{"dur":1,"text":"places in their lives"},"684":{"dur":3,"text":"when our society\ncould've intervened in their lives"},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"and

--"},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"say was a bad result."},"699":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, during each of these five chapters:"},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"when his mother was pregnant with

way that society could intervene\nin each of those five chapters,"},"725":{"dur":2,"text":"and we could mix and match them\nany way we want,"},"727":{"dur":4,"text":"there are 3,000 -- more than 3,000 --\npossible strategies"},"731":{"dur":1,"text":"that we could embrace"},"733":{"dur":4,"text":"in order to nudge kids like Will\noff of the path that they're on."},"738":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'm not standing here today\nwith the solution."},"742":{"dur":3,"text":"But the fact that we\nstill have a lot to learn,"},"746":{"dur":3,"text":"that doesn't mean\nthat we don't know a lot

using in Texas,"},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"and in every other state\nthat isn't using them,"},"761":{"dur":3,"text":"in order to prevent a consequence\nthat we all agree is bad."},"765":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll just mention a few."},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"I won't talk today\nabout reforming the legal system."},"772":{"dur":1,"text":"That's probably a topic"},"773":{"dur":3,"text":"that is best reserved\nfor a room full of lawyers and judges."},"776":{"dur":3,"text":"Instead, let me talk\nabout a couple of modes of

money."},"794":{"dur":3,"text":"We could be providing early childhood care"},"797":{"dur":4,"text":"for economically disadvantaged\nand otherwise troubled kids,"},"802":{"dur":2,"text":"and we could

are a bunch of other things --"},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"there's one other thing\nthat I'm going to mention,"},"838":{"dur":3,"text":"and this is going to be the only\ncontroversial thing that I say

them"},"850":{"dur":3,"text":"before their moms pick up butcher knives\nand threaten to kill them."},"855":{"dur":3,"text":"If we're going to do that,\nwe need a place to put them."},"859":{"dur":1,"text":"Even if we do all of those things,"},"861":{"dur":2,"text":"some kids are going\nto fall through the cracks"},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"and they're going to end up\nin that
