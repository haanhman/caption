through some of what\nthe team has been working hard"},"20":{"dur":2,"text":"on, some properties\nof the ecosystem"},"23":{"dur":2,"text":"that we find make\nit ideally

some best practices"},"32":{"dur":3,"text":"and a quick look\nat what's coming up"},"35":{"dur":1,"text":"in a future release\nof the platform."},"40":{"dur":4,"text":"So firstly, some

even"},"50":{"dur":1,"text":"in my presentation."},"51":{"dur":2,"text":"The thing that I take\naway from this slide,"},"53":{"dur":2,"text":"in particular, is this\nfinal statistic here."},"56":{"dur":2,"text":"This 82% of\nsmartphones, according"},"58":{"dur":4,"text":"to a Gartner study late last\nyear, were shipping Android."},"63":{"dur":3,"text":"And we find that incredibly\npowerful as a team working"},"66":{"dur":4,"text":"on these enterprise features,\nbut also incredibly humbling."},"71":{"dur":3,"text":"When I talk to friends who,\nperhaps, aren't in technology,"},"74":{"dur":3,"text":"aren't in mobile technology,\nspecifically, there's"},"77":{"dur":2,"text":"a very broad\nspectrum of awareness"},"79":{"dur":1,"text":"about Android as a\nbrand, and what it is,"},"81":{"dur":1,"text":"and what it does for people."},"83":{"dur":1,"text":"But yet, I find it\nincredibly powerful"},"84":{"dur":2,"text":"that during those conversations,\nif they reach into their pocket"},"87":{"dur":2,"text":"and pull out a\nsmartphone, chances"},"89":{"dur":1,"text":"are it's an Android smartphone."},"91":{"dur":4,"text":"Chances are it's capable of\nrunning all of these management"},"95":{"dur":3,"text":"modes, all of these policies\nthat I'll talk through,"},"98":{"dur":1,"text":"and if it's not\nalready running them,"},"100":{"dur":4,"text":"then it could be taken to a\nBYOD deployment of their company"},"105":{"dur":1,"text":"the next day."},"106":{"dur":1,"text":"We find that\nincredibly powerful,"},"108":{"dur":1,"text":"an aspect of the\nplatform, and we certainly"},"110":{"dur":2,"text":"hope that you do too."},"112":{"dur":2,"text":"So that was on the overall side."},"115":{"dur":1,"text":"What about enterprise?"},"117":{"dur":4,"text":"So another large number, or\npercentage of a large number--"},"121":{"dur":2,"text":"here, we see a bit of\nroom for improvement."},"124":{"dur":4,"text":"Obviously, it's not the 82%\nstatistic that you saw back"},"128":{"dur":1,"text":"on the previous slide."},"129":{"dur":1,"text":"So the first and\nmost obvious area"},"131":{"dur":3,"text":"that we want to\ngrow this number in"},"134":{"dur":2,"text":"is doubling down on\nour core features."},"137":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'll take you through\nsome of those core features"},"139":{"dur":1,"text":"later on in the presentation."},"141":{"dur":2,"text":"But really making sure\nthat Android serves these"},"143":{"dur":3,"text":"managed use cases\nas well as possible."},"146":{"dur":2,"text":"That your employees, your\nusers are able to get up"},"149":{"dur":2,"text":"and running as quickly and\nas smoothly as possible,"},"152":{"dur":4,"text":"and that they are\nsecured by default."},"156":{"dur":2,"text":"The other, perhaps\nless obvious, direction"},"159":{"dur":2,"text":"that we are growing in\nis this figure, here,"},"161":{"dur":2,"text":"caters for basically,\nnon-consumer usage"},"164":{"dur":2,"text":"of the platform, B2B\nsales of Android devices."},"167":{"dur":4,"text":"And so we want to make sure

as productive"},"177":{"dur":2,"text":"and secure as possible,\nno matter what's required."},"183":{"dur":1,"text":"OK, enough of the\nnumbers for now."},"185":{"dur":1,"text":"What are we going\nto look at today?"},"187":{"dur":3,"text":"So firstly, I thought we'd\ntake a look at the ecosystem"},"190":{"dur":2,"text":"overall, some properties\nof the ecosystem"},"192":{"dur":3,"text":"that I wanted to draw\nparticular attention to"},"195":{"dur":1,"text":"in the enterprise space."},"197":{"dur":4,"text":"We'll look at some\nof the form factors"},"202":{"dur":4,"text":"that we see, some of the apps\nand properties of the app"},"206":{"dur":1,"text":"ecosystem."},"207":{"dur":4,"text":"Then we'll move\nonto what Android--"},"212":{"dur":1,"text":"the team that I work\non, what does Android"},"214":{"dur":2,"text":"do in the enterprise,\nand how can you"},"217":{"dur":2,"text":"put these tools that we\nput into the platform"},"219":{"dur":1,"text":"to use within your organization?"},"220":{"dur":0,"text":"We'll look at security."},"221":{"dur":2,"text":"We'll look at the two\nmain management modes"},"223":{"dur":2,"text":"and what you can do with them."},"226":{"dur":1,"text":"Then we'll take a look\nat some best practices"},"227":{"dur":2,"text":"and wrap up with a look\nat what the team has"},"230":{"dur":2,"text":"been hard at working\non for an upcoming"},"232":{"dur":1,"text":"release of the platform."},"236":{"dur":2,"text":"OK, so firstly, a\nlook at the ecosystem."},"238":{"dur":2,"text":"You never hear\nmention of Android"},"241":{"dur":1,"text":"without mention\nof the ecosystem,"},"242":{"dur":1,"text":"perhaps in the same breath."},"243":{"dur":3,"text":"The two are pretty\nmuch intertwined."},"246":{"dur":2,"text":"Here are some properties that\nI find particularly exciting"},"249":{"dur":4,"text":"and particularly interesting\nabout Android as an ecosystem."},"253":{"dur":2,"text":"First is devices."},"256":{"dur":2,"text":"There is so much choice\nof different devices"},"259":{"dur":2,"text":"that you can put to\nwork for your users"},"261":{"dur":2,"text":"and for your\nparticular use case."},"263":{"dur":2,"text":"You'll hear a lot about\nthe power of the cloud,"},"266":{"dur":2,"text":"particularly in this\nconference, and the tools that"},"268":{"dur":3,"text":"are available there\nto really serve"},"272":{"dur":2,"text":"a lot of different large\ncompute requirements."},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"I think, actually, we\nhave one of the best"},"277":{"dur":2,"text":"jobs within this ecosystem,\nwhich is actually"},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"getting to play with all\nthese physical devices"},"283":{"dur":1,"text":"and making sure that--"},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"helping our partners really\ninnovate and make sure"},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"that there's a device\navailable to meet"},"289":{"dur":2,"text":"pretty much any different\nuse case you can imagine."},"291":{"dur":1,"text":"There's a few different\nverticals here"},"293":{"dur":1,"text":"that are almost conspicuous\nby their absence."},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"I've pulled out the\nmost traditional devices"},"298":{"dur":2,"text":"and their appeal for\nenterprise management,"},"300":{"dur":1,"text":"but obviously conspicuous\nby their absence"},"302":{"dur":5,"text":"are whole verticals in auto\ninternet of things, obviously,"},"307":{"dur":1,"text":"and TV."},"309":{"dur":1,"text":"So there's definitely more."},"310":{"dur":1,"text":"And the point that\nI want to make"},"311":{"dur":3,"text":"is that the diversity here is\ndefinitely more than just price"},"315":{"dur":0,"text":"point."},"316":{"dur":3,"text":"Its about having a device for\nany particular different use"},"319":{"dur":1,"text":"case that you have in mind."},"321":{"dur":2,"text":"Whether that's [INAUDIBLE]\na single purpose"},"324":{"dur":2,"text":"deployment that you heard\nmy colleague, Vidia, talking"},"326":{"dur":1,"text":"about earlier."},"327":{"dur":3,"text":"Whether its traditional\nsmartphone use case."},"331":{"dur":3,"text":"Whether its signage\nor kiosk purposes."},"334":{"dur":4,"text":"There really is a device for\neverything you can imagine."},"339":{"dur":3,"text":"Now with the scale and with\nthe diversity of the Android"},"342":{"dur":4,"text":"ecosystem, it's easy to imagine\nthat some amount of complexity"},"347":{"dur":3,"text":"may come with deploying\napplications and managing"},"351":{"dur":2,"text":"devices at this kind of scale."},"353":{"dur":3,"text":"And while that's certainly true,\nthe way that I look at this"},"356":{"dur":4,"text":"is that Android provides this\nplatform, this underlying"},"361":{"dur":3,"text":"layer of consistency,\nwhere otherwise you"},"364":{"dur":1,"text":"wouldn't be able to have."},"365":{"dur":3,"text":"For example, your same set of\ndevelopers write the same app"},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"and have it run in a\nconsistent way across most"},"372":{"dur":1,"text":"of these different devices."},"373":{"dur":1,"text":"They would have, but\nwouldn't, perhaps,"},"375":{"dur":4,"text":"be able to benefit from\nthe unified deployment"},"380":{"dur":1,"text":"platform in Google Play."},"381":{"dur":2,"text":"And so there's a lot\nthat we do and is really"},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"front of mind for the\nAndroid team, in general."},"386":{"dur":1,"text":"And certainly, for\nthe enterprise team,"},"388":{"dur":1,"text":"one of the areas\nthat we invest in"},"389":{"dur":1,"text":"is ensuring that\nthese devices can"},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"be deployed in a\nconsistent way to our users"},"394":{"dur":2,"text":"and managed using a\nconsistent API surface."},"396":{"dur":1,"text":"So that's something\nincredibly important to us."},"398":{"dur":1,"text":"I won't stand in front\nof you today and pretend"},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"that it's job done, there,\ncertainly a work in progress,"},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"but that's something\nthat we find powerful"},"405":{"dur":3,"text":"and hopefully you do to."},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"The final point that\nI'll note is obviously"},"411":{"dur":1,"text":"these devices are\ncapable of connecting"},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"to so many different\ncloud backends"},"414":{"dur":3,"text":"that I'm sure you'll hear more\nabout later on in the talk."},"417":{"dur":3,"text":"But just from a raw\ncompute power perspective,"},"421":{"dur":3,"text":"these devices are getting\nso much more capable day in,"},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"day out, that\ncertainly the flagship"},"426":{"dur":4,"text":"smartphones that you come across\ntoday are incredibly capable."},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"The software that runs\non them, the apps,"},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"is only getting more and\nmore powerful over time."},"436":{"dur":3,"text":"And we're starting\nto see these replace"},"439":{"dur":4,"text":"a lot of general purpose desktop\nkind of use cases already."},"443":{"dur":2,"text":"This is something that the\nteam is very excited about"},"446":{"dur":4,"text":"and we see growing a\ngreat deal over time."},"450":{"dur":3,"text":"OK, so a few more big\nnumbers, apologies."},"454":{"dur":1,"text":"This is about the Play platform."},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"It will be kind of remiss\nto talk about the largest"},"458":{"dur":1,"text":"mobile ecosystem in the\nworld without talking"},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"about the largest\napp distribution"},"461":{"dur":3,"text":"platform in the world, which\nis of course, Google Play."},"464":{"dur":3,"text":"Some of these numbers are\njust astounding, I find."},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"65 billion-plus app\ninstalls for Play."},"470":{"dur":1,"text":"I believe that was\nin the past year."},"471":{"dur":3,"text":"A million-plus apps\navailable, unique"},"475":{"dur":3,"text":"apps within the store to\nserve all of the different use"},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"cases you can imagine for\nthese different devices."},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"And a billion-plus 30-day\nactive users of Google apps."},"484":{"dur":1,"text":"That's Google apps\nwith a lower case a."},"486":{"dur":3,"text":"That's apps provided by Google."},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"And obviously, in the app\nside of the ecosystem, the app"},"492":{"dur":1,"text":"distribution side,\nI'll talk a bit more"},"493":{"dur":3,"text":"about this like what we\nbuild into the Play platform"},"497":{"dur":4,"text":"to help you manage these\ndeployments at scale, shortly,"},"502":{"dur":1,"text":"but this is a key\narea, again, where"},"503":{"dur":5,"text":"we strive to bring\nconsistency to the ecosystem."},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"And finally, in\nthis set of slides,"},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"a quick nod to all\nof our partners who"},"513":{"dur":1,"text":"make this possible."},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"Obviously this isn't the full\ngamut of partners for Android"},"517":{"dur":3,"text":"as an ecosystem,\nbut it's phenomenal,"},"521":{"dur":1,"text":"and again, quite\nhumbling to think"},"523":{"dur":3,"text":"that a lot of these\nbusinesses, if not totally"},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"put a great deal of--"},"529":{"dur":4,"text":"are able to benefit a great\ndeal from the ecosystem at large"},"533":{"dur":4,"text":"and provide for a great deal\nof their business from it."},"537":{"dur":1,"text":"There's a partner\nfor almost any use"},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"case in any deployment you\ncan imagine or set of partners"},"542":{"dur":1,"text":"to come and enable that."},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"So we're immensely grateful\nto our partners, some of which"},"546":{"dur":1,"text":"I know are here today."},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"OK, so I don't need\nto spend too much time"},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"talking about the size and\nscale of Android, perhaps."},"555":{"dur":4,"text":"Onto what we do and what\nmy team works on in order"},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"to help you secure\nthese devices and get up"},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"and running as\nquickly as possible."},"566":{"dur":1,"text":"And again, the goal\nthat we focus on here,"},"568":{"dur":2,"text":"first and foremost, is to\nbring as much consistency"},"570":{"dur":2,"text":"to the management and the\ndeployment of these devices as"},"573":{"dur":2,"text":"possible, and be able\nfor your employees"},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"to reach into their pocket\nand pull out an Android phone,"},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"and get them up and running\nand productive in seconds."},"583":{"dur":3,"text":"So firstly, let's take a look\nat what the platform provides."},"587":{"dur":2,"text":"How does it all fit together?"},"590":{"dur":1,"text":"Really, on this\nslide, the platform"},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"is everything in the lower\nright side of the diagram."},"595":{"dur":1,"text":"Everything that's\noutlined in blue"},"596":{"dur":4,"text":"here is stuff that the wider\nenterprise team focuses on."},"601":{"dur":2,"text":"It's top of mind for us\nand we provide toolsets"},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"in each of these components to\nhelp you get up and running."},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"From the platform perspective,\nobviously the bottom block here"},"610":{"dur":3,"text":"you see is the Android Open\nSource Project, AOSP for short."},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"This is the really powerful\nbit of the platform"},"616":{"dur":3,"text":"that enables all of our\npartners to extend and submit"},"619":{"dur":3,"text":"contributions to Android,\nan what really makes"},"623":{"dur":1,"text":"it unique as a mobile platform."},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"Most of the stuff that\nour team actually works on"},"627":{"dur":4,"text":"goes into this AOSP\nlevel of the platform."},"631":{"dur":1,"text":"That's the management\nmodes that I'll"},"633":{"dur":3,"text":"talk through later-- the\nprovisioning, the policies that"},"637":{"dur":1,"text":"get enforced."},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"Most of it goes into this\ncore underlying layer"},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"that underpins everything else."},"643":{"dur":1,"text":"Immediately above\nthe AOSP layer,"},"644":{"dur":4,"text":"you have Google Mobile\nServices, or GMS for short."},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"And these provide\nreally everything"},"650":{"dur":2,"text":"that is Google about\nAndroid devices."},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"Some notable components that\nyou all have heard of in there"},"655":{"dur":1,"text":"is Google Play itself."},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a suite of security\ncomponents in there"},"659":{"dur":1,"text":"that I'll talk a\nlittle bit about,"},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"and you'll hear more\nabout in some other talks"},"663":{"dur":4,"text":"throughout the conference."},"667":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, these two\npieces as a whole"},"670":{"dur":1,"text":"provide the core platform."},"671":{"dur":3,"text":"There's an API surface that's\nexposed through these two"},"675":{"dur":3,"text":"components, and we work with\nour EMM partners, our Enterprise"},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"Mobility Management partners,\nwho actually sit at the app"},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"level just above this."},"684":{"dur":4,"text":"The EMMs provide an app which\nis able to call these APIs."},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"They're really responsible\nfor setting up the devices"},"691":{"dur":4,"text":"and choosing which policies\nto enforce to really cater"},"695":{"dur":3,"text":"for your particular deployment\nor your particular vertical,"},"699":{"dur":1,"text":"shaping that platform\ninto something"},"701":{"dur":4,"text":"that's able to serve those use\ncases as smoothly as possible."},"705":{"dur":3,"text":"Immediately above that we\nhave, again on the app side,"},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"there's a suite of apps\nthat Google provide,"},"711":{"dur":2,"text":"most notably Gmail,\nCalendar, et cetera."},"714":{"dur":3,"text":"We as an enterprise team\nput a huge deal of effort"},"717":{"dur":2,"text":"into actually making sure\nthat the likes of Gmail"},"720":{"dur":3,"text":"is able to get up and\nrunning on whatever"},"723":{"dur":1,"text":"email backend you may have."},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"If your company is using\nMicrosoft Exchange ActiveSync"},"728":{"dur":3,"text":"as a stack, for example,\nit's very important to us"},"731":{"dur":3,"text":"that you are able to get up and\nrunning on that using Gmail,"},"734":{"dur":2,"text":"and we put a lot of\neffort into having"},"737":{"dur":2,"text":"your users be able\nto get out of the box"},"739":{"dur":3,"text":"and productive by default."},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"Likewise, the enterprise apps--"},"746":{"dur":3,"text":"I highlighted the\nmillion-plus different apps"},"749":{"dur":3,"text":"available in Play."},"753":{"dur":3,"text":"This is a huge amount of\ninvestment in diversity"},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"that comes from the\necosystem and is really"},"758":{"dur":2,"text":"made possible from\nour ecosystem partners"},"760":{"dur":2,"text":"to serve all of these\ndifferent use cases."},"763":{"dur":1,"text":"Last but not least\non this slide,"},"764":{"dur":3,"text":"we have a set of services\nthat the team invests in."},"767":{"dur":1,"text":"This is, most\nnotably, Google Play."},"769":{"dur":3,"text":"There's a suite of APIs that is\navailable to our EMM partners"},"773":{"dur":1,"text":"to manage and deploy apps."},"774":{"dur":3,"text":"I'll talk a little bit about\nhow that function shortly."},"777":{"dur":3,"text":"And safety net, which is sort of\nthe broad term for the security"},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"components that are bundled\nby default in GMS Android"},"784":{"dur":3,"text":"devices, which again, I'll\ndrill into a little bit"},"787":{"dur":1,"text":"in an upcoming slide."},"789":{"dur":2,"text":"So here's a quick look at\nwhere Android management has"},"792":{"dur":3,"text":"come from and I'll finish up\nby having a quick look at where"},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"we're going."},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"So the first thing\nto note, probably,"},"800":{"dur":1,"text":"is that we've rebranded."},"801":{"dur":3,"text":"You probably won't see much\nmention of Android for Work"},"804":{"dur":0,"text":"anymore."},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"This was a rebrand, or\ntechnically an unbrand,"},"809":{"dur":1,"text":"back in December of last year."},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"And what's happened, how\nthe platform has evolved,"},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"has really led to all\nof these tools that"},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"were previously known of\nas being part of Android"},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"for Work, as being\npart of that offering."},"823":{"dur":3,"text":"They're now completely bundled\ninto any Android device."},"826":{"dur":2,"text":"So any Android device\nthat you pick up"},"829":{"dur":2,"text":"will be capable of running--"},"831":{"dur":1,"text":"a work-managed\ndevice, for example,"},"833":{"dur":3,"text":"will be capable of supporting\na profile as long as it's not"},"836":{"dur":3,"text":"a low RAM device,\nfor example, and is"},"839":{"dur":3,"text":"capable of deploying all\nthis uniform platform"},"842":{"dur":1,"text":"policies throughout."},"844":{"dur":3,"text":"So the unbrand, we think, makes\na lot of sense in that respect."},"848":{"dur":2,"text":"It does make it slightly\ndifficult to actually talk"},"850":{"dur":1,"text":"about what we as a team do."},"851":{"dur":3,"text":"So I'm thinking of starting a\nnice little sideline of Android"},"855":{"dur":3,"text":"for Work swear jar and I\nthink that will generate"},"859":{"dur":1,"text":"a lot of profit,\nif not just for me,"},"860":{"dur":3,"text":"during the course of\nthis presentation."},"864":{"dur":0,"text":"OK."},"865":{"dur":5,"text":"So more about the team's\nwork and what we're up to."},"871":{"dur":3,"text":"So the first management\nmode, if you like,"},"874":{"dur":3,"text":"and the first capability\nthat we invested in way back"},"878":{"dur":2,"text":"in Lollipop when we came\nto produce what I'll"},"880":{"dur":2,"text":"refer to as sort of the\nmodern set of management APIs"},"883":{"dur":2,"text":"that are available,\nis the work profile."},"886":{"dur":6,"text":"The work profile really allows\nyou to keep your employees'"},"892":{"dur":2,"text":"data separate from--"},"895":{"dur":1,"text":"keep your work data,\nrather, separate"},"896":{"dur":2,"text":"from your personal data\non these deployments."},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"We think that this is a\nreally powerful building"},"901":{"dur":4,"text":"block for BYOD in particular."},"905":{"dur":4,"text":"So for example, just in order\nto sync work data to the device"},"909":{"dur":2,"text":"in order to be productive\nas an end user who"},"912":{"dur":4,"text":"owns their own device,\nit's easy to imagine"},"916":{"dur":3,"text":"that a lot of work data needs\nto be synced, but also a lot"},"919":{"dur":1,"text":"of what policy needs\nto come with that data"},"921":{"dur":2,"text":"to keep it secure."},"923":{"dur":3,"text":"And the work profile\nreally contains that data,"},"927":{"dur":1,"text":"and the management\nthat comes with it,"},"929":{"dur":1,"text":"and ensures that\nnothing spills out"},"930":{"dur":2,"text":"into the personal\nside of the device."},"932":{"dur":2,"text":"So we find this incredibly\npowerful for both end"},"935":{"dur":3,"text":"users, who no longer need to\nworry about management taking"},"939":{"dur":2,"text":"over the rest of their\ndevice, being able to wipe out"},"941":{"dur":3,"text":"their personal apps and\nphotos or anything else,"},"944":{"dur":3,"text":"and also for IT admins who don't\nwant the burden of thinking"},"948":{"dur":2,"text":"about this aspect\nof their deployment,"},"950":{"dur":2,"text":"and thinking about\nhow users are going"},"953":{"dur":1,"text":"to have to hand over\nthat much control"},"955":{"dur":2,"text":"over their personal devices."},"957":{"dur":2,"text":"So some notable aspects of\nthe work profile and the"},"959":{"dur":2,"text":"features that it provides."},"962":{"dur":2,"text":"If for whatever reason your\nwork data needs to be wiped,"},"964":{"dur":3,"text":"most notably the profile\njust disappears, the profile"},"968":{"dur":2,"text":"and the work data\nthat goes with it."},"971":{"dur":2,"text":"You can

other?"},"2435":{"dur":2,"text":"TOM WATKINS: So the question\nwas on the future-looking stuff,"},"2437":{"dur":1,"text":"will that be part\nof the platform"},"2439":{"dur":2,"text":"or in the services\nside of the stack?"},"2442":{"dur":1,"text":"And the answer is\nit will be a mix."},"2443":{"dur":4,"text":"Broadly speaking,\nthe new capabilities"},"2447":{"dur":3,"text":"for the devices, the new work\nprofiles on corporate devices,"},"2451":{"dur":3,"text":"that will be platform features\navailable in an upcoming"},"2454":{"dur":1,"text":"version of

certainly\na bunch coming."},"2477":{"dur":2,"text":"I focused more on the\ntraditional platform stuff."},"2480":{"dur":1,"text":"Thank you."},"2482":{"dur":1,"text":"Hi there."},"2483":{"dur":3,"text":"SPEAKER 2: [INAUDIBLE]\nabout the API"},"2487":{"dur":2,"text":"that you mentioned were upcoming\nthat were checking the security"},"2490":{"dur":1,"text":"[INAUDIBLE]

amount"},"2520":{"dur":1,"text":"in the branding of\nthese security features,"},"2522":{"dur":1,"text":"but it's just called safety net."},"2523":{"dur":1,"text":"That's kind of what it does."},"2525":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah, I'd highly\nrecommend you look"},"2527":{"dur":3,"text":"at his talk for\ndetails of exact APIs"},"2531":{"dur":2,"text":"that are going to be available\nas part

stack--"},"2541":{"dur":1,"text":"most of our investment\nin the Android team"},"2542":{"dur":5,"text":"certainly goes into the\nAndroid side of the platform."},"2548":{"dur":1,"text":"So the question, just\nto repeat it here,"},"2550":{"dur":2,"text":"was can we expand\nto iOS devices?"},"2552":{"dur":3,"text":"SPEAKER 3: Not safety net, but\nthe [INAUDIBLE] management of"},"2555":{"dur":3,"text":"[INAUDIBLE]"},"2559":{"dur":2,"text":"TOM WATKINS: This\nis not something"},"2561":{"dur":4,"text":"that we're considering bringing\nto iOS or other

some of the use\ncases that that enables."},"2573":{"dur":6,"text":"SPEAKER 3: [INAUDIBLE] MDM\nfor iOS [INAUDIBLE] platform"},"2580":{"dur":1,"text":"for Android."},"2582":{"dur":1,"text":"TOM WATKINS: Yeah, absolutely."},"2583":{"dur":3,"text":"So I think our focus is\nreally on making Android"},"2586":{"dur":2,"text":"as usable and as\nmanageable as possible"},"2589":{"dur":1,"text":"for any different deployments."},"2590":{"dur":3,"text":"And again, this is a very broad\nspectrum in the Android world."},"2594":{"dur":3,"text":"So our focus is definitely\non the Android side,"},"2597":{"dur":3,"text":"but I think we find that\nfeatures like the work profile"},"2601":{"dur":2,"text":"and, let's say, more\nopinionated stances"},"2603":{"dur":3,"text":"that we've taken on how\ndevice management should work,"},"2607":{"dur":3,"text":"we're quite proud of that\nability, that separation."},"2610":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, we find that in some\ncases and some deployments,"},"2613":{"dur":4,"text":"it makes Android\nstand out when you're"},"2617":{"dur":1,"text":"looking to choose a platform."},"2619":{"dur":3,"text":"But absolutely, and when\nyou're talking BYOD,"},"2622":{"dur":1,"text":"you've got to cater\nfor any device"},"2623":{"dur":2,"text":"that your users will bring."},"2626":{"dur":1,"text":"So definitely\nsomething that will"},"2628":{"dur":4,"text":"be top of mind for an IT admin\nwith your kind of deployment."},"2632":{"dur":1,"text":"Any more questions?"},"2633":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll go over here."},"2635":{"dur":0,"text":"Hi."},"2636":{"dur":11,"text":"SPEAKER 4: [INAUDIBLE]"},"2647":{"dur":2,"text":"TOM WATKINS: So the question is\nabout certificate

that\nwork with profile separation,"},"2656":{"dur":1,"text":"for example?"},"2657":{"dur":2,"text":"And the answer is,\nreally, to a large extent,"},"2659":{"dur":2,"text":"you can treat the work\nprofile as a whole device."},"2662":{"dur":1,"text":"And so there is a\nseparate key store"},"2664":{"dur":2,"text":"inside the work profile,\nseparately encrypted"},"2667":{"dur":2,"text":"with the file-based encryption."},"2669":{"dur":2,"text":"And so, as part of that setup\nprocess for just the work"},"2671":{"dur":1,"text":"profile, you can\nhave that certificate"},"2673":{"dur":2,"text":"provisioned into the work\nprofile side of the key store."},"2676":{"dur":2,"text":"Likewise, we have a\nVPN that's available,"},"2679":{"dur":3,"text":"just

welcome."},"2686":{"dur":0,"text":"The back."},"2687":{"dur":1,"text":"SPEAKER 5: Is there\na way to remotely"},"2688":{"dur":5,"text":"opt into a privacy statement\nand to the terms of service?"},"2694":{"dur":1,"text":"[INAUDIBLE] EMM."},"2696":{"dur":1,"text":"TOM WATKINS: Good question."},"2697":{"dur":2,"text":"So the question is\ncan you remotely opt"},"2700":{"dur":3,"text":"into the privacy statements\nwhen setting up a device?"},"2705":{"dur":2,"text":"The broad answer is no,\nthat's not something"},"2708":{"dur":1,"text":"that's possible today."},"2710":{"dur":2,"text":"Particularly on\nthe BYOD side, we"},"2712":{"dur":4,"text":"want to make sure that end\nusers actually see this."},"2716":{"dur":3,"text":"For what I mentioned earlier,\nthe upcoming feature, the work"},"2720":{"dur":2,"text":"profile that's going to be\navailable on corp managed"},"2722":{"dur":3,"text":"devices, we found that there\nis certainly a strong

a work\nprofile silently just"},"2735":{"dur":2,"text":"on those corp-managed devices."},"2738":{"dur":3,"text":"That's the feature that's\navailable on personal devices."},"2741":{"dur":3,"text":"The
