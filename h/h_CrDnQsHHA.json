what I would\nencourage folks to do if--"},"289":{"dur":1,"text":"is first and for most,"},"291":{"dur":1,"text":"write down what your\nprofessional interest are."},"293":{"dur":3,"text":"So

after you've done that, you\nkind of write down their names,"},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"and then you do something\nthat's incredibly different"},"361":{"dur":1,"text":"as you may want to-- you know,"},"363":{"dur":1,"text":"it's not common today is\nyou pick up the telephone,"},"365":{"dur":2,"text":"you call them, and\nyou say, \"Hey,"},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm really interested\nin your

to a job."},"398":{"dur":1,"text":"Once you've done that, you've\nhad an opportunity to speak"},"400":{"dur":2,"text":"with people, I would invite you\nthen to look for opportunities"},"403":{"dur":1,"text":"to shadow those people."},"404":{"dur":2,"text":"And what I mean by shadowing\nsomebody is literally taking the"},"407":{"dur":3,"text":"opportunity to go literally\nwalk behind the network."},"411":{"dur":3,"text":"So using the same\nexample of video games."},"414":{"dur":1,"text":"I really like to\nplay video games."},"415":{"dur":1,"text":"I like to do something\nvideo games."},"417":{"dur":3,"text":"I get an introduction to\nsomebody in Disney Interactive."},"421":{"dur":3,"text":"And from there, I go and I talk\nwith somebody who says,

around, you sit\ndown, and you watch them work."},"434":{"dur":2,"text":"What that will do is\nit will give insight"},"436":{"dur":2,"text":"that otherwise you\nwould never have."},"438":{"dur":2,"text":"And overtime as you do that\nwith different disciplines"},"441":{"dur":1,"text":"and different interest\nthat you have"},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"that helps you narrow your list\nin what you really want to do."},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"I actually put together\njust like a brief kind"},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"of way I would look at it."},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"So once again, I would kind of\nwrite down, \"Hey, I'm interested"},"451":{"dur":1,"text":"in the video game industry.\""},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"And from there, I'd write\ndown, hey, I'm interested"},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"of me potentially being a\nsoftware developer and maybe"},"458":{"dur":3,"text":"in design and I know somebody\nat Take-Two Interactive,"},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"I know somebody at Disney,\nyou write down their names,"},"463":{"dur":1,"text":"and then you go ahead and\nyou reach out to them,"},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"call them and\/or email them."},"467":{"dur":3,"text":"But it's a really simple way\nof refining your interests"},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"and looking at other\nopportunities."},"473":{"dur":3,"text":"I remember, if I go back when I\nwas in college, I really thought"},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"to myself like what I\nwould really want to do,"},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"and a lot of-- there's a\nlot of ambiguity about that,"},"482":{"dur":3,"text":"this helps narrow that\ndown and eliminate things"},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"that you really-- you\nmay be interested,"},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"but you really may\nnot enjoy doing."},"490":{"dur":3,"text":"And so after you've gone\nthrough this exercise,"},"494":{"dur":1,"text":"you've had an opportunity\nto shadow people,"},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"and you narrowed your\nlist down to maybe two"},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"or three different\nindustries or jobs,"},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"then I would invite you then\nuse your network and leverage"},"502":{"dur":1,"text":"that network to help\nyou get an internship,"},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"and then from an internship,\nobviously, into a job."},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"So I know this is\nabout entrepreneurship,"},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"I think that actually, it\nties well to entrepreneurship."},"515":{"dur":2,"text":"I have-- I'm really fortunate,\nI have the opportunity to work"},"517":{"dur":1,"text":"with some of the greatest\nentrepreneurs literally"},"519":{"dur":3,"text":"in the world, with some of the\nfinest [phonetic] companies"},"522":{"dur":1,"text":"that you read about in The Wall\nStreet Journal, the TechCrunch,"},"524":{"dur":3,"text":"and I would say not all of them,\nyou know, came out of Stanford,"},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"and immediately started,\nyou know, a company."},"530":{"dur":1,"text":"There are number\nof them that have--"},"532":{"dur":3,"text":"they took experiences that they\nlearned in their previous jobs,"},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"leverage that experience,"},"537":{"dur":1,"text":"took that into what\nthey're doing today."},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"So as much as, you know, we\nread about the Mark

industries\nand verticals and leverage"},"549":{"dur":2,"text":"that into some type of\nnew business and try"},"551":{"dur":2,"text":"to disrupt something they\nhave more information"},"554":{"dur":1,"text":"about than somebody else."},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"And you get that by experience,"},"556":{"dur":1,"text":"you get that by being\npassionate about something."},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"That passion comes by\ndoing something you enjoy,"},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"and you don't really\nknow what you enjoy"},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"until you get exposure,\nand so that exposure comes"},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"by doing this process\nof elimination."},"567":{"dur":3,"text":"So it's a way to accelerate\nthat process of elimination"},"571":{"dur":3,"text":"versus just taking the job two\nyears later, taking a new job;"},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"two years later, taking a\nnew job, it accelerates that."},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's kind of my first\ninsight that I would like to--"},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"if I were in your shoes, that'd\nbe something that I really want"},"584":{"dur":3,"text":"to know is how I can get\nexposure to different interests"},"588":{"dur":2,"text":"that I have and really quickly\ndo a process of elimination"},"591":{"dur":1,"text":"as to whether or not\nthis is something I want"},"593":{"dur":2,"text":"to pursue a career in."},"595":{"dur":4,"text":"So let's say for example, I've\ntaken-- let's do video games."},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"And I have the opportunity to go\nwork in the video game industry."},"603":{"dur":3,"text":"Huh. I'm really big into--\nyou see, it's mobile gaming"},"607":{"dur":1,"text":"and I've done really\nwell on mobile."},"608":{"dur":1,"text":"And feel like if after\nworking at, you

going to go start\nmy own company."},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, what would I\ndo if I were going"},"626":{"dur":0,"text":"to go start my own company?"},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"I started with Scalar,\nand just kind"},"630":{"dur":1,"text":"of give you a little bit\nmore background of myself."},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"I started at Scalar when Scalar\nwas literarily two

years."},"647":{"dur":1,"text":"So I do have exposure to this."},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"Prior to running\nScalar, actually,"},"650":{"dur":1,"text":"we're in a technology company."},"651":{"dur":2,"text":"We're in a company\ncalled America Home Today."},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"We focus on user-generated\ncontact and lead generation."},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"And so-- And in my two\nexperiences, which I think were"},"660":{"dur":3,"text":"on my bio, I'm currently\nnot involved"},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"with the [inaudible] board\nof advisor of TenX Networks"},"666":{"dur":1,"text":"which is a hardware\ntechnology company."},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"I subsequently have kind\nstepped down from that role."},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"Still have a close\nrelationship with the CEO."},"673":{"dur":1,"text":"And then the other company\nis Capshare which was--"},"675":{"dur":1,"text":"I was part of the\nfounding team of

that board of\ndirectors as well."},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"But obviously have exposure\nand experience there."},"689":{"dur":4,"text":"So if I were-- going back to\nmy analogy, if I'm sitting"},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"at Disney and I'm saying\nthis, OK, I'm leaving."},"696":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to go start with\nmy mobile app company."},"697":{"dur":1,"text":"I think there's something\nreally interesting here."},"698":{"dur":1,"text":"I have a mobile application\nI think"},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"that could disrupt the market."},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"What would I do

really just if you're\ngoing in life in general,"},"742":{"dur":1,"text":"it's all about your team."},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"So I put the question up there,\nyou know, what do start
