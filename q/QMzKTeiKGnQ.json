the"},"1570":{"dur":1,"text":"community's giving."},"1571":{"dur":2,"text":"And now that I've had a look at\nit, I'm going to take that"},"1574":{"dur":3,"text":"with one click, take that answer\nthat

put it onto the\nwebsite, into the contact"},"1590":{"dur":2,"text":"center, et cetera."},"1592":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, we've had a lot of\nfun building this."},"1595":{"dur":3,"text":"And customers

lot."},"1609":{"dur":3,"text":"So as you all know, every\ntime you post any"},"1612":{"dur":1,"text":"information on Twitter--"},"1613":{"dur":2,"text":"you complain about a product,\nyou ask a

the"},"1667":{"dur":2,"text":"team that handles netbooks."},"1669":{"dur":2,"text":"So let's switch across and we'll\nshow you what it looks"},"1672":{"dur":3,"text":"like for the Dell\nservice
