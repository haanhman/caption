a"},"522":{"dur":4,"text":"bunch of good programs, like the Nurse-Family\nPartnership that I mentioned before."},"526":{"dur":1,"text":"They're small."},"527":{"dur":3,"text":"My favorite system is

pediatrician."},"591":{"dur":3,"text":"He says, \"I'll give you training in these\nprograms."},"595":{"dur":4,"text":"It's ten sessions for basic program if you\nwanna learn about helping a parent

then you go out there in the community."},"609":{"dur":1,"text":"You've got this tool kit."},"610":{"dur":6,"text":"It's a little bit like doctors who go off\nevery year for a week or so of retooling."},"616":{"dur":1,"text":"It's that same kind of effort."},"618":{"dur":4,"text":"Then, they do a lot of social marketing to\nget parents aware of what's happening."},"623":{"dur":1,"text":"So, the minister says something to them."},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"You go to the principal to talk about your\nchild."},"627":{"dur":5,"text":"The principal says, \"By the way, there's this\nprogram that's available if you're interested"},"633":{"dur":1,"text":"in doing it.\""},"634":{"dur":2,"text":"And the program is whatever the parents want."},"636":{"dur":6,"text":"It's everything from pick up a pamphlet to\nparticipate in a ten-week course to, on some"},"642":{"dur":3,"text":"occasions when you have a really difficult\nproblem, it's some one-on-one or small group"},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"work."},"648":{"dur":5,"text":"And the data is amazing in terms of what the\nimpact is."},"654":{"dur":8,"text":"In this country, the Center for Disease Control\ndid an evaluation of Triple P and the units"},"663":{"dur":5,"text":"of comparison were eleven rural counties in\nSouth Carolina that got Triple P, and eleven"},"668":{"dur":1,"text":"others that didn't."},"670":{"dur":3,"text":"That's a huge population base."},"673":{"dur":4,"text":"And the CDC was concerned about abuse and\nneglect."},"677":{"dur":7,"text":"And it was interested in two measures--hospitalization\nof kids in foster care placements, both indicia"},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"of parent's abuse and neglect."},"686":{"dur":2,"text":"Big, big differences between those communities."},"689":{"dur":6,"text":"And they would've been bigger still had Triple\nP been allowed to use TV ads, which they couldn't"},"696":{"dur":4,"text":"because the TV ads would be seen across counties."},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"This is new."},"702":{"dur":6,"text":"And all of anything that I'm saying is

how"},"731":{"dur":4,"text":"important early brain development is to kids."},"735":{"dur":5,"text":"I do wanna say that it's not what goes on\nin an early education program."},"740":{"dur":8,"text":"A

those"},"768":{"dur":4,"text":"kids, they really are curious about everything."},"772":{"dur":4,"text":"And you give them things that really will\nboth satisfy their curiosity and whet their"},"776":{"dur":4,"text":"appetite for more and you've got a teacher\nwho understands how to be helpful and how"},"781":{"dur":2,"text":"to stand back and let the kids work."},"783":{"dur":1,"text":"Amazing stuff goes on."},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"But it's not just cognition that's important."},"787":{"dur":5,"text":"It's also all those things that go on in a\ngood
