me."},"39":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's take a look at the core\nequipment that we're going to cover."},"43":{"dur":5,"text":"We'll start off by taking a look at what's\nprobably our best microphone, the R\u00d8DE NTG2,"},"49":{"dur":4,"text":"which is a directional mic,\notherwise known as a shotgun."},"53":{"dur":3,"text":"Then we're going to look at this\nlapel mic, the R\u00d8DE Lavalier."},"57":{"dur":6,"text":"Next we'll take a look at the R\u00d8DE VideoMic Pro,\nwhich is designed to work with a DSLR camera."},"63":{"dur":2,"text":"Next up is the Zoom H2n,"},"65":{"dur":5,"text":"which is an all-in-one portable recording\ndevice with its own built-in microphones."},"71":{"dur":2,"text":"Finally, we're going to talk\nabout the R\u00d8DE Podcaster,"},"74":{"dur":3,"text":"which is designed to record\ndirectly onto a computer."},"77":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's get started\nwith the R\u00d8DE NTG2."},"80":{"dur":5,"text":"I'm just going to get\neverything else off the table."},"86":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, this is a directional\nmic, also known as a shotgun."},"90":{"dur":8,"text":"It's a good microphone to use with\nthe JVC HM150, which I've got here."},"98":{"dur":5,"text":"Shotgun mics are very sensitive and have\nwhat\u2019s called a super cardioid polar pattern."},"104":{"dur":5,"text":"Polar patterns are a visual way of understanding\nwhich direction a mic is sensitive to,"},"109":{"dur":3,"text":"in other words, where it picks\nup sound and where it doesn\u2019t."},"113":{"dur":4,"text":"As you can see from this diagram, super\ncardioid is a narrow-focused pattern"},"117":{"dur":4,"text":"that targets sound directly in front of the\nmicrophone, and rejects it from the side,"},"122":{"dur":4,"text":"just like a shotgun, shooting\nin one focused direction."},"126":{"dur":4,"text":"This is really useful, because it means you\ncan focus on specific sources of sound."},"131":{"dur":4,"text":"The directional nature of shotguns make\nthem the go-to mic for video production,"},"135":{"dur":3,"text":"because they act just like a camera\u2019s\nlens, pointing in one direction."},"139":{"dur":4,"text":"Shotguns are also useful if you want\nto keep your microphone out of shot."},"143":{"dur":3,"text":"One thing you have to remember with\nthis mic is it can't be handheld."},"146":{"dur":3,"text":"If you do touch it, you\u2019re going to get\na nasty rustling sound, like this\u2026"},"150":{"dur":4,"text":"Now obviously this mic isn't plugged\nin, but that's the magic of editing."},"155":{"dur":4,"text":"You want to avoid that kind of noise at all\ncost, because it will ruin your recording."},"159":{"dur":4,"text":"What you need to do to avoid handling\nnoise is put the microphone on a mount."},"163":{"dur":4,"text":"For instance, you could use an on-camera\nmount like this one on the JVC."},"167":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'll just show you\nquickly how to do that."},"170":{"dur":4,"text":"Put it in, close it up.\nThere you go."},"175":{"dur":5,"text":"Make sure it's nice and tight so that\nthe microphone doesn't wobble around."},"180":{"dur":4,"text":"Now you don't have to touch the mic, and the\nlittle rubber pads inside the mount mean that"},"185":{"dur":4,"text":"it's not going to pick up any handling noise\nwhen you're operating the camera either."},"190":{"dur":2,"text":"Once you've mounted\nyour microphone,"},"192":{"dur":3,"text":"of course the next thing you have to\ndo is connect it up to your camera."},"195":{"dur":5,"text":"The NTG2, like most professional\nmicrophones, connects using an XLR cable,"},"201":{"dur":6,"text":"and in this situation, you're going to need\nan extra short one, like this one here."},"207":{"dur":4,"text":"Now, you can always tell an XLR\ncable by these three-pin plugs,"},"212":{"dur":8,"text":"and what you do is you take the female end, and\nyou stick it in to the end of your microphone."},"220":{"dur":2,"text":"Until it clicks into place."},"222":{"dur":4,"text":"Then you take the other end and you plug\nit into the XLR input on your camera."},"227":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll just do that."},"229":{"dur":2,"text":"There you go, you're\nall connected up."},"232":{"dur":2,"text":"This set-up is great\nif you're by yourself"},"234":{"dur":2,"text":"and you're having to move around\na lot while you're shooting."},"236":{"dur":5,"text":"It's going to give you a natural sound with an\nacceptable level of focus on your audio subject."},"241":{"dur":2,"text":"However, you are limited\nby your shooting distance,"},"243":{"dur":5,"text":"and you're not going to be able to get the mic\ncloser in for a more focused sound recording."},"249":{"dur":7,"text":"The other thing you can do is mount the\nmicrophone on a pistol grip, like this one."},"256":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, a pistol grip does an even better job at\nisolating the microphone from handling noise,"},"261":{"dur":4,"text":"thanks to this rubber suspension\ncradle, also known as a shock-mount."},"266":{"dur":3,"text":"Let me just show you how to put the\nmicrophone into the pistol grip."},"270":{"dur":4,"text":"I'll take it out of here,\nand take the cable off."},"274":{"dur":3,"text":"You can't put it into the pistol\ngrip with the cable attached."},"277":{"dur":4,"text":"And it slides in like this\u2026 It's\nactually pretty hard to do."},"282":{"dur":4,"text":"Just push it in, don't worry too much.\nThere you go."},"286":{"dur":4,"text":"Now you can see why it's called a pistol\ngrip, because it looks like a gun."},"290":{"dur":4,"text":"Once the microphone's in, you can adjust\nthis head using this locking lever here."},"295":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll just undo it for you."},"297":{"dur":4,"text":"There you go. I'm going to put it up.\nLock it down."},"302":{"dur":3,"text":"And make sure this little knob is tight\nso that it doesn\u2019t wobble around."},"305":{"dur":8,"text":"With this pistol grip, you can use the NTG2\nas a handheld interview mic, like this."},"314":{"dur":6,"text":"You can also attach it to a boom\npole, like the one I've got here."},"321":{"dur":4,"text":"Using a boom pole allows you to get your\nshotgun closer to the source of your sound,"},"325":{"dur":5,"text":"and it also allows you to point it at a specific\ndirection, and change that direction responsively."},"331":{"dur":3,"text":"So for instance, if you're\nrecording two people talking,"},"334":{"dur":4,"text":"you can get your mic and point it to one\nperson first, and then the next person,"},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"picking up both voices clearly."},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"A boom pole certainly\nadds production value,"},"343":{"dur":3,"text":"but you do need an extra person\non your crew to operate it."},"347":{"dur":4,"text":"A boom operator is very useful, because\nthey also often act as a soundman,"},"352":{"dur":4,"text":"taking care of every aspect of your sound\nrecording, like monitoring and levels."},"356":{"dur":4,"text":"This is great, because it allows your\ncameraman to focus only on the visuals."},"361":{"dur":4,"text":"But using a boom pole isn't as easy as it looks,\nso I'm just going to talk a bit more about it."},"366":{"dur":5,"text":"To attach the pistol grip to the boom pole, what\nyou need to do is attach the end of the grip\u2026"},"371":{"dur":5,"text":"\u2026here you can see, the screw\u2026\nto the end of the pole."},"377":{"dur":4,"text":"Let's do that.

It can be a bit tricky.\nJust fiddle around, and you'll get it in the end."},"405":{"dur":3,"text":"Once you've extended your boom pole\nout to the length that you want it,"},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"which will probably\nbe longer than this,"},"410":{"dur":4,"text":"you can attach your mic to your recording\ndevice using a long XLR cable."},"415":{"dur":3,"text":"I'd recommend something\nbetween five and ten metres."},"418":{"dur":5,"text":"I've got one here, so let's\njust show you what to do."},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"This is ten metres,\nwhich is quite long."},"427":{"dur":8,"text":"So let's attach the end."},"435":{"dur":5,"text":"Now cables are a soundman's nightmare.\nAnd here's a good tip\u2026"},"440":{"dur":10,"text":"What you should do is put the cable around the\nboom pole like this, and then hold it taut,"},"451":{"dur":5,"text":"and that's going to stop it flapping against the\nboom pole, which your mic is going to pick up."},"456":{"dur":3,"text":"OK, so let me show you\nhow to hold a boom pole."},"460":{"dur":6,"text":"They're normally held high above your head like\nthat, although down below is also a viable option."},"466":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm not going to hold it too high, because\nyou won't be able to see what I'm doing."},"469":{"dur":5,"text":"Hold the foam part of the pole, and have\nyou hands facing outwards like this."},"475":{"dur":5,"text":"And what you do is you rest the pole here in your\nleading hand between the thumb and the forefinger."},"481":{"dur":5,"text":"That way you can easily turn the mic, if you\nneed to change the way that it's pointing,"},"486":{"dur":3,"text":"using your hand here at\nthe base of the pole."},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"And this hand is also\ngripping the wire."},"492":{"dur":7,"text":"I'm just going to move along so that you\ncan see what's happening at the mic end."},"499":{"dur":6,"text":"When you're using a boom pole, or even when you're\njust holding this pistol grip during an interview,"},"506":{"dur":4,"text":"you have to be really careful that your\nmicrophone doesn\u2019t appear in shot."},"510":{"dur":4,"text":"You should also be aware of any shadows\ncast by your microphone or your boom pole."},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"Making sure your microphone is out\nof shot is especially difficult"},"518":{"dur":4,"text":"if you're using a big, fluffy\nwindshield like this one."},"523":{"dur":5,"text":"The NTG2 does come with it's own\nfoam shield, which I've got here."},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"I'd recommend you use this\nwhen you're shooting indoors,"},"531":{"dur":3,"text":"but when you go outdoors,\nalways change to this one."},"534":{"dur":13,"text":"And this is why. This is sound recorded outside\nin moderate wind using the foam shield."},"548":{"dur":11,"text":"And this is sound recorded\nusing the fluffy windshield."},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"Now I'm just going to show\nyou how to put them on."},"562":{"dur":6,"text":"It just slips over the microphone like\nthat. It's really easy. Pull it off."},"569":{"dur":5,"text":"Put the foam one on. There you go.\nNo trouble at all."},"574":{"dur":6,"text":"This fluffy windshield can be used on the\nmicrophone when it's mounted on your camera,"},"581":{"dur":2,"text":"but you do have to be careful\nthat it doesn't appear in shot,"},"583":{"dur":3,"text":"which means you might have to\nzoom in a tad to avoid it."},"586":{"dur":5,"text":"If you don't have a boom operator, you could also\nuse a mic stand or a light stand as an alternative."},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"Of course, a stand is only useful\nif you don't have to move around."},"596":{"dur":13,"text":"So let's get rid of our boom\npole\u2026 and bring in a stand."},"610":{"dur":6,"text":"This is a mic stand. Now, mic stands and light\nstands have different screw attachment sizes."},"616":{"dur":6,"text":"Light stands usually have the same size\nscrew attachment as the R\u00d8DE Boompole,"},"623":{"dur":4,"text":"which means you can carry on using\nyour pistol grip if you want to."},"627":{"dur":4,"text":"Microphone stands, especially tall floor stands\nlike this one, usually have bigger threads,"},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"so you're not going to be\nable to use the pistol grip."},"634":{"dur":4,"text":"Instead you're going to have to use\nanother type of mount. Like this one."},"639":{"dur":5,"text":"Now this is a simple, plastic microphone\nmount that actually comes with the NTG2."},"644":{"dur":8,"text":"It fastens on quite easily to\nthe end of the stand like this."},"653":{"dur":5,"text":"Right, better tighten that up.\nThere we go."},"658":{"dur":5,"text":"It can be quite difficult to get the\nmicrophone into one of these mounts."},"664":{"dur":5,"text":"But if you angle it like this and\npush down, it does clip into place."},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"If you're leaving you mic\non a stand like this,"},"671":{"dur":3,"text":"you have to be careful it doesn't\naccidentaly get knocked over,"},"675":{"dur":4,"text":"so put a sandbag or a similar kind\nof weight on the base of the stand."},"679":{"dur":3,"text":"Those were a few ways\nof handling the NTG2."},"682":{"dur":4,"text":"Before we move on, there are a few other\nimportant things you need to know about the mic."},"687":{"dur":4,"text":"Firstly, it's a condenser microphone,\nwhich means it needs to be powered."},"692":{"dur":4,"text":"In general, this power's going to come from\nyour recording device via the XLR cable,"},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's something that\u2019s\ncalled phantom power."},"699":{"dur":5,"text":"To use phantom power you need to make sure your\ndevice is set to send power to the microphone."},"705":{"dur":5,"text":"On the JVC, what you have to do is make sure\nthat this switch here is set to \"Mic +48v\"."},"710":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'll do it here on Input 2,"},"712":{"dur":3,"text":"and I'm only doing it on Input 2 because\nI'm plugged in to Input 2 here."},"716":{"dur":3,"text":"I'll just do that\nto the camera."},"719":{"dur":5,"text":"There you go, switch it down to \"Mic +48v\"\nand you're sending power to your mic."},"724":{"dur":3,"text":"Alternatively, the NTG2\ncan run on battery power."},"728":{"dur":4,"text":"What you need is a 1.5v AA battery,\njust a normal battery like this."},"733":{"dur":4,"text":"And it fits into this compartment\nat the end of the microphone."},"737":{"dur":6,"text":"There it is, unscrew it, pop the\nbattery in, screw it back up,"},"743":{"dur":3,"text":"and there you go, you don't need phantom\npower now from your recording device."},"747":{"dur":4,"text":"Finally, the NTG2 has a switchable\nhigh pass filter, which you can use"},"752":{"dur":4,"text":"when you want to get rid of low frequency\nsounds such as traffic or air conditioning."},"756":{"dur":2,"text":"I'll show you where it is.\nThere it is."},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"Now to turn it on, what you need\nis a small screwdriver or a pen."},"763":{"dur":1,"text":"So I'll show you how to do it."},"764":{"dur":2,"text":"Stick the pen in there\nand switch it up."},"766":{"dur":1,"text":"It's really easy to do."},"768":{"dur":4,"text":"The filter works by blocking\nsound frequencies below 80 Hz,"},"772":{"dur":3,"text":"and letting higher frequency\nsounds pass through."},"775":{"dur":4,"text":"It can affect the tonal characteristics of\nyour audio, so be very careful when using it."},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"Do a few test recordings\nto make sure."},"784":{"dur":3,"text":"So that was the R\u00d8DE\nNTG2 shotgun microphone."},"787":{"dur":2,"text":"Lets move on now to\nthe R\u00d8DE Lavalier."},"790":{"dur":6,"text":"I'm just going to get everything off the\ntable, and bring on the R\u00d8DE Lavalier."},"797":{"dur":3,"text":"As you can see, it comes\nin this useful box."},"800":{"dur":3,"text":"And this is the microphone."},"804":{"dur":4,"text":"Lavaliers are also known as lavs,\nlapel mics, or clip on mics."},"809":{"dur":3,"text":"They're designed to be used during\ninterviews or dialogue scenes."},"813":{"dur":2,"text":"As you can see, they're\nreally small microphones,"},"816":{"dur":5,"text":"and with this clip they can easily be attached to\na person's clothing, like the one I've got here."},"821":{"dur":4,"text":"This gives you great quality audio because\nit's right next to the source of your sound,"},"825":{"dur":2,"text":"which in this case is my voice."},"827":{"dur":3,"text":"The R\u00d8DE Lav has an\nomnidirectional polar pattern."},"831":{"dur":4,"text":"As you can see from this diagram, this means\nit picks up sound from all directions."},"835":{"dur":4,"text":"As such, you don't have to worry too much about\nwhich direction your microphone is pointing,"},"840":{"dur":4,"text":"or about things like slight head movements, that\nmight change where your sound is coming from."},"844":{"dur":1,"text":"You do have to worry\nabout getting the mic"},"846":{"dur":2,"text":"as close as possible to the\nsource of your sound, however,"},"849":{"dur":3,"text":"otherwise you're going to pick\nup a lot of background noise."},"852":{"dur":2,"text":"Setting up and using a\nlav is fairly easy."},"855":{"dur":4,"text":"When you first get your R\u00d8DE Lav, you may find\nthat it's seperated out into different parts."},"860":{"dur":6,"text":"So I'm just going to take it apart\nhere, to show you how to assemble it."},"867":{"dur":6,"text":"What you'll get is this MiCon cable,\nthen you've got the microphone head,"},"873":{"dur":4,"text":"which is tiny, so be really careful\nyou don't loose it or drop it,"},"878":{"dur":3,"text":"Then you've got the\nmicrophone clip,"},"882":{"dur":7,"text":"and you've got two different connectors to\nconnect to different recording devices."},"889":{"dur":5,"text":"Finally, you've got these two different\nmicrophone shields or covers."},"894":{"dur":4,"text":"What you do is you take this MiCon\ncable and attach the head to it."},"899":{"dur":3,"text":"You can attach it to either end of\nthe cable, so that's quite easy."},"902":{"dur":2,"text":"You screw it on\ngently like that."},"905":{"dur":2,"text":"Then you need to\nchoose your adaptor."},"907":{"dur":6,"text":"In this case, I'm going to go with the XLR adaptor,\nbecause I want to plug the lav into the JVC."},"914":{"dur":2,"text":"Screw it on like that."},"916":{"dur":5,"text":"It's pretty heavy, so you have\nto be careful. There we go."},"921":{"dur":3,"text":"Now if I was going to use the lav\nwith the Zoom audio recorder,"},"925":{"dur":4,"text":"I'd be using this connector instead,\nwhich is a minijack connector."},"929":{"dur":5,"text":"The connections on the MiCon cable are quite\ndelicate, so you do need to be careful."},"934":{"dur":4,"text":"Make sure that the microphone and the\nconnector are screwed on firmly though,"},"938":{"dur":3,"text":"because if you have a loose connection,\nyou're going to get interference,"},"941":{"dur":1,"text":"which is going to\nruin your recording."},"943":{"dur":4,"text":"To attach the clip, what you do is\nyou hold it between two fingers,"},"948":{"dur":2,"text":"and then you press down\non this wire loop,"},"951":{"dur":4,"text":"and you stick the microphone head\nthrough the loop, and you let go."},"955":{"dur":4,"text":"The microphone has these little grooves on its\nbody, and that's where the wire should go."},"960":{"dur":3,"text":"And it should hold pretty\nfirmly in place like that."},"963":{"dur":7,"text":"With the clip on this side, the microphone\nis going to attach to this side of my body."},"970":{"dur":8,"text":"To have it on the other side, what you need to do is\ntake it off, turn it upside down, and put it on again."},"978":{"dur":3,"text":"And there you go, it's going to\nattach to this side of my body."},"982":{"dur":2,"text":"Finally, you've got these\ntwo microphone shields."},"985":{"dur":3,"text":"This one here is\ncalled a pop filter,"},"988":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'd recommend you use it at\nall times when recording indoors."},"990":{"dur":5,"text":"It helps prevent the popping sound\nyou get when you say \"p\"s and \"t\"s."},"995":{"dur":5,"text":"This furry one here is called a mini furry, and\nit's for use outdoors to prevent wind noise."},"1001":{"dur":2,"text":"Both of them fit very\nsnugly onto the microphone."},"1004":{"dur":5,"text":"What you do is you just push them on\nlike that, you see.
