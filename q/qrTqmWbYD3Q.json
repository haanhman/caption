the\ninner states of the machine."},"188":{"dur":3,"text":"So, take, for example a machine that's\ndoing a sum."},"192":{"dur":5,"text":"And you asked it, what's 2 plus 8?\nNow, you could have a

some"},"317":{"dur":5,"text":"very interesting things to say about this.\nHe introduced us the following thought"},"322":{"dur":3,"text":"experiment.\nHe says, imagine that you are in a

through the"},"367":{"dur":4,"text":"output box, the O box, you pick up a\nsymbol, and put it back through the O box."},"372":{"dur":4,"text":"Now imagine that, unknown to you, these\nsymbols are

you're"},"384":{"dur":3,"text":"receiving questions and you're actually\ngiving out answers."},"387":{"dur":4,"text":"And the rule book is such that you're\nactually giving our really quite coherent"},"392":{"dur":2,"text":"answers.\nIn fact, you're realizing something like a"},"395":{"dur":5,"text":"machine that would pass Turing's test.\nSo, the Chinese speaker outside really"},"400":{"dur":4,"text":"believes that she's conversing with\nanother Chinese speaker."},"405":{"dur":6,"text":"Now, the big question that Searle asks is,\nwell, I, the person inside the box, or the"},"411":{"dur":3,"text":"person inside the room don't understand\nChinese."},"415":{"dur":4,"text":"So, if I were unable to converse with this\nChinese speaker in a way that seems"},"420":{"dur":5,"text":"perfectly coherent to the person outside,\nI, myself, have no understanding of what"},"425":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm doing.\nIt doesn't make sense to say, I

just"},"436":{"dur":3,"text":"how computers work.\nComputers receive inputs and then their"},"440":{"dur":4,"text":"program is like the logbook.\nThe program tells them what sort of output"},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"they should give.\nSo, they check it, they check up or they"},"447":{"dur":3,"text":"run through a list of rules.\nAnd see that, given a particular input,"},"451":{"dur":5,"text":"they should give a particular output.\nBut Searle's point is that, that machine"},"456":{"dur":3,"text":"can never itself be said to

Searle's"},"522":{"dur":5,"text":"thought experiment is that computers only\nwork on syntactic properties of symbols."},"528":{"dur":3,"text":"What does this mean?\nWell, imagine you have a square with a"},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"line through it.\nAnd that's a symbol."},"535":{"dur":4,"text":"And let's just say that, that symbol is\nChinese for the question, do you like"},"539":{"dur":3,"text":"ducks?\nAnd you're the person inside the Chinese"},"542":{"dur":4,"text":"room and you get the symbol in.\nNow, all you have to work on is the"},"547":{"dur":5,"text":"syntactic properties of the symbols.\nThe syntactic property is just the square"},"552":{"dur":3,"text":"with the line, it's the shape of the\nsymbol if you like."},"556":{"dur":5,"text":"So, you look at the shape of symbol and\nyou can add an answer depending on what"},"561":{"dur":4,"text":"the shape of the symbol is.\nNow, the important thing about

for."},"573":{"dur":4,"text":"The computer doesn't need to understand\nthat a square with a line through it means"},"577":{"dur":4,"text":"the question, do you like ducks, all it\nneeds to be able to

thought are the"},"591":{"dur":4,"text":"semantic properties.\nSemantic properties are what that symbol"},"595":{"dur":3,"text":"stands for.\nSo, the square with a line through it"},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"stands for the question, do you like\nducks?"},"601":{"dur":4,"text":"What it stands for, the meaning is known\nas the semantic property of that
