system."},"1161":{"dur":2,"text":"We're so brain dominant, brain-centric."},"1164":{"dur":2,"text":"So if you put your attention in the heart,"},"1166":{"dur":4,"text":"you're putting your

the very fact\nthat you put your attention"},"1229":{"dur":2,"text":"on the center of your chest,\nor in the heart area"},"1231":{"dur":3,"text":"starts to drift you into\na slightly more positive
