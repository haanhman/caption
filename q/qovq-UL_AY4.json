officers."},"692":{"dur":3,"text":"This censorship, however, became fairly cursory"},"696":{"dur":4,"text":"as officers with the necessary linguistic\nskills were killed."},"701":{"dur":4,"text":"But

original letters I think must\nnow be lost,"},"752":{"dur":3,"text":"but I'll end with one of them that we've found."},"756":{"dur":4,"text":"How did soldiers and their families write\ntheir letters?"},"760":{"dur":5,"text":"The census of India show that 94 per cent\nof the Indian population was illiterate."},"765":{"dur":4,"text":"A few soldiers might have been literate, such\nas officers or company clerks,"},"770":{"dur":3,"text":"but most soldiers and their families must\nhave used letter writers"},"773":{"dur":3,"text":"and letter readers to read and write their letters."},"777":{"dur":3,"text":"And this, of course, affected what the correspondents\nwere prepared to say,"},"780":{"dur":6,"text":"since they knew the letters were... \nit was possible that they

the troops"},"803":{"dur":3,"text":"were illiterate, suggests that the letters mattered."},"806":{"dur":5,"text":"In 1915 there were about 20,000 letters a\nweek coming from Indian troops in France,"},"812":{"dur":2,"text":"a huge number from four divisions."},"814":{"dur":4,"text":"For most troops it was the only way they could\ncommunicate with their

about"},"866":{"dur":3,"text":"what should happen to their pensions when\nthey get killed."},"869":{"dur":4,"text":"And some also write home urging their families"},"874":{"dur":3,"text":"not to enlist because the losses are so high."},"877":{"dur":2,"text":"These letters were passed by the censor"},"880":{"dur":1,"text":"because he felt that they were simply trying"},"882":{"dur":2,"text":"to prevent harm happening to their families,"},"884":{"dur":2,"text":"rather than expressing disloyalty."},"887":{"dur":2,"text":"There was a great reproach when a soldier learnt"},"890":{"dur":2,"text":"that one of his family had joined up."},"892":{"dur":2,"text":"'It is a matter for regret that you,' he wrote,"},"895":{"dur":5,"text":"'as a sensible man should put your foot into\nthe blazing fire.'"},"900":{"dur":5,"text":"In areas where blood feuds were practised,\nsome soldiers used the military post"},"906":{"dur":4,"text":"as a vehicle for

home,"},"915":{"dur":4,"text":"'If you have any sense of honour, and if you\nare a real Pathan,"},"919":{"dur":3,"text":"then you should take your revenge by killing\ntwo enemies quickly,'

through."},"944":{"dur":4,"text":"There is another side to this picture of courage\nand loyalty, however."},"948":{"dur":4,"text":"Problems of morale did become fairly evident\nearly on in 1914"},"953":{"dur":3,"text":"and soldiers write fairly despairing letters,"},"956":{"dur":4,"text":"particularly towards the end of the First\nBattle of Ypres."},"960":{"dur":3,"text":"One man wrote
