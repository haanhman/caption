cold."},"157":{"dur":1,"text":"You\u2019ll be able to \u2013 what?"},"158":{"dur":7,"text":"So anyway they would lower it into the oil\nwell and then apparently in his day they would"},"166":{"dur":4,"text":"have wired electricity and they would set\nit off \u2013 boom \u2013 dynamite or nitroglycerine."},"170":{"dur":3,"text":"But in the old, old days \u2013 I\u2019ve seen his\nbook \u2013 they had something like a shotgun"},"173":{"dur":4,"text":"shell and a rope and they would yank it \u2013 boom."},"177":{"dur":5,"text":"So that would be fracturing or fracking right\nat the bottom of the well straight down."},"183":{"dur":1,"text":"That was the state of the art."},"185":{"dur":7,"text":"But what\u2019s happened now we can steer drill\nbits in just three

fracking."},"276":{"dur":6,"text":"You drill sideways and then you pump fracking\nfluid \u2013 it\u2019s incompressible stuff and"},"282":{"dur":3,"text":"give it a pow and then it cracks everything\nand the gas comes up."},"286":{"dur":4,"text":"The gas doesn\u2019t always come out the tube\nthat you put it in or the opening you put"},"290":{"dur":1,"text":"it in."},"291":{"dur":1,"text":"Sometimes it comes out in somebody\u2019s sink."},"293":{"dur":2,"text":"So fracturing is not inherently bad."},"296":{"dur":4,"text":"The problem with renewable energy

man."},"314":{"dur":5,"text":"We were all able to drive cars, burn gasoline,\nmake carbon dioxide, make a greenhouse gas,"},"320":{"dur":5,"text":"leave open containers of gasoline around

this."},"423":{"dur":1,"text":"I mentioned \u2013 we talked about fracking a\nmoment ago."},"424":{"dur":3,"text":"We, it was me doing the talking about fracking."},"427":{"dur":1,"text":"We are
