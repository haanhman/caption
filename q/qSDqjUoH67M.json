that,"},"630":{"dur":3,"text":"my goodness they are all from here."},"634":{"dur":5,"text":"And he meant Central Asia and, of\ncourse, Tajikistan particularly"},"640":{"dur":5,"text":"but somewhere from like Rabi'a\nBalkhi, she's obviously from Balkh."},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"But they were from\nthe East if you will."},"648":{"dur":4,"text":"And he said, so I decided\nto put them all on the

something"},"673":{"dur":3,"text":"that geographically is\nnot part of Iran today."},"676":{"dur":4,"text":"Well, that's not quite true\nbecause the eastern edge of Iran"},"681":{"dur":6,"text":"as

beyond."},"997":{"dur":3,"text":"Why did he know about the Greeks?"},"1001":{"dur":3,"text":"Because Syrian Christians\nwho knew Arabic"},"1004":{"dur":5,"text":"and knew Greek were translating\nthese
