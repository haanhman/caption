diversity of plant species:\nforbs, grasses, legumes, trees."},"546":{"dur":4,"text":"And then also you had a diversity\nof animals and insects,"},"550":{"dur":4,"text":"and all these worked

leaving roots in the ground\nas long as possible."},"689":{"dur":2,"text":"You don't have to drive very far\naround this state"},"692":{"dur":4,"text":"to see that there are monocultures growing\nfor only a short period of time,"},"697":{"dur":1,"text":"and then the land lays idle."},"699":{"dur":3,"text":"These are just some of the cover crop\nspecies which we planted"},"702":{"dur":2,"text":"on

optimizing solar energy collection."},"723":{"dur":6,"text":"Because how the system works is,\nwe take sunlight through photosynthesis;"},"729":{"dur":4,"text":"it makes carbon; that carbon\nis transferred down to the roots,"},"733":{"dur":5,"text":"where it's leaked out as root exudates,\nthat's what all the biology feeds on."},"739":{"dur":4,"text":"We need that biology in order\nto get

agriculture do we aim\nat just killing that pest,"},"799":{"dur":4,"text":"when we should aim at providing habitat\nfor all those beneficials?"},"804":{"dur":5,"text":"The reason producers have a pest

infiltrate\na half of an inch of rainfall per hour."},"867":{"dur":1,"text":"We then went no-till."},"869":{"dur":2,"text":"We started to diversify\nthe cash crop rotation;"},"871":{"dur":2,"text":"we

rose,"},"881":{"dur":1,"text":"our infiltration improved."},"883":{"dur":3,"text":"We then started integrating\nall of these livestock species"},"886":{"dur":1,"text":"on top of it -"},"887":{"dur":4,"text":"another marked increase\nin the health of our soil ecosystem."},"892":{"dur":3,"text":"Now in 2013, we actually\nhave a plot of land"},"895":{"dur":4,"text":"which is now

hour,"},"906":{"dur":3,"text":"can now infiltrate\nover 15 inches of rainfall per hour."},"910":{"dur":4,"text":"We've done this without the use\nof any synthetic
