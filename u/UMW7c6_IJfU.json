Not only is this young"},"481":{"dur":5,"text":"man a \"rich young ruler,\" as he is often called,\nbut there are other things to notice as far"},"486":{"dur":6,"text":"as the differences. First off, he doesn't\nknow what Jesus knew. That's why he asked"},"493":{"dur":9,"text":"him, \"What must I do that I can inherit eternal\nlife?\" Another difference is that he was nowhere"},"503":{"dur":6,"text":"near the level of spirituality that Jesus\nwas. He recognized that Jesus was a teacher."},"509":{"dur":6,"text":"\"Good Teacher,\" he asked, \"what must I do\nto inherit eternal life?\" A third thing to"},"516":{"dur":6,"text":"make note of is this young man was pretty\nself-righteous. When Jesus rattles off the"},"523":{"dur":7,"text":"commandment, he boldly asserted, \"I've kept\nall of these from my youth.\" And the fourth"},"530":{"dur":6,"text":"difference is this young man was gripped by\nthe sin of greed and materialism."},"537":{"dur":7,"text":"And once confronted by Jesus, he didn't respond\nfavorable.

Let's move to the second."},"749":{"dur":8,"text":"Jesus loves people individually; that is,\nhe loves them uniquely, separately, independent"},"757":{"dur":4,"text":"in his approach from one person to the next."},"762":{"dur":5,"text":"What I find interesting about the Lord in\nthis section of our text that we're reading,"},"767":{"dur":5,"text":"chapter 10 of Mark, earlier in this chapter\nhe picked up some children, held them, blessed"},"773":{"dur":5,"text":"them---so tender. In the very next chapter\nhe overturns the tables in the temple and"},"779":{"dur":8,"text":"drives out the worshipers and rebukes them.\nHe definitely approached people individually."},"787":{"dur":7,"text":"One of the things that I have long admired\nand loved the Lord Jesus for is that he never"},"795":{"dur":6,"text":"had a canned approached to people. He never,\nlike, began with the same spiel or the same"},"801":{"dur":7,"text":"question. He just kind of varied his approach\nfrom person to person.

Example: to the\nwoman caught in adultery, he said, \"Woman,"},"902":{"dur":5,"text":"where are your accusers?\" She said, \"Sir,\nI have none.\" He replied, \"Neither do I condemn"},"908":{"dur":11,"text":"you; go and sin no more\"---so tender. To the\nman, the leper who was ostracized from society,"},"919":{"dur":4,"text":"who said, \"Lord, if you are willing, you can\nmake me clean.\" Now he was a leper, nobody"},"924":{"dur":5,"text":"was allowed to touch him. \"Jesus touched him,\"\nthe Bible says, \"touched him, and said, 'I"},"929":{"dur":4,"text":"am willing; be clean.' \""},"933":{"dur":6,"text":"Then on the other hand, to the scribes and\nthe Pharisees he spoke very harshly, words"},"940":{"dur":7,"text":"like this: \"Woe unto you, scribes, Pharisees,\nhypocrites!

Very"},"956":{"dur":6,"text":"different than the woman caught in adultery.\nSometimes he called people by name, like Mary"},"962":{"dur":7,"text":"Magdalene after the resurrection with that\ntender tone, \"Mary,\" or \"Peter.\" At other"},"970":{"dur":5,"text":"times he didn't call people by their first\nnames, he made up new names for them. One"},"975":{"dur":8,"text":"time he said, \"Brood of vipers!\" That's what\nhe called them. There's another difference"},"984":{"dur":5,"text":"in the way he approached people. He walked\nup one day to Matthew the tax collector and"},"989":{"dur":5,"text":"publicly called him out and said, \"Come and\nfollow me as my disciple.\""},"995":{"dur":5,"text":"Then on another occasion, when he cast a demon\nout of a young man in Gedara who begged Jesus"},"1000":{"dur":7,"text":"to let him come and follow him, Jesus said,\n\"No. You can't follow me. Go back home and"},"1008":{"dur":4,"text":"tell your friends the good things God has\ndone.\" Very different approaches to these"},"1012":{"dur":7,"text":"two. Here's another difference: to his own\ndisciples, Jesus spoke profusely. He instructed."},"1020":{"dur":7,"text":"We have chapter after chapter in the New Testament\ngiven directly to the disciples. He's training"},"1028":{"dur":6,"text":"them. He had a lot to say to them. But then\non another occasion, as he stands before Pontius"},"1034":{"dur":7,"text":"Pilate and the religious elite at his own\ntrial, he has nothing to say to them. And"},"1042":{"dur":6,"text":"then when we finally speaks, it's just a few\nwords, not much."},"1048":{"dur":5,"text":"Another difference: in Capernaum, a wailing\ncrowd at the funeral of a young girl who has"},"1054":{"dur":7,"text":"died, Jesus comes in the scene, and he goes,\n\"Stop crying. Stop weeping.\" On another occasion,"},"1061":{"dur":4,"text":"at the funeral of his friend Lazarus, we are\ntold that Jesus himself stood in front of"},"1066":{"dur":5,"text":"the tomb, and it says, \"Jesus wept.\" Now,\nhe knew he was going to raise both of them"},"1071":{"dur":6,"text":"from the dead, but in once sense he goes,\n\"Stop your crying,\" and here, \"Jesus wept.\""},"1078":{"dur":5,"text":"Here's what I want to point out: the love\nof Jesus Christ was tailor-made for every"},"1083":{"dur":9,"text":"individual that he met.
