was\nmuch harder than I"},"145":{"dur":1,"text":"expected to be gone that much."},"146":{"dur":3,"text":"So all the way through,\nI really was like, wow,"},"150":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm getting tugged

school."},"172":{"dur":3,"text":"And middle school was\nrocky, as it often is."},"175":{"dur":3,"text":"And I started\ngetting calls where,"},"178":{"dur":1,"text":"OK, so he's getting bad

in a private school"},"191":{"dur":1,"text":"and we put him in public school."},"193":{"dur":1,"text":"This was really an issue."},"194":{"dur":3,"text":"And so that's when\nI started

all."},"223":{"dur":1,"text":"You can make it happen."},"224":{"dur":2,"text":"And, wow, I really can't."},"227":{"dur":6,"text":"So then I go home, and I was\nmore focused on being

fine."},"246":{"dur":3,"text":"And then I sat down-- well,\na couple things happened."},"249":{"dur":3,"text":"One was I really noticed\nthat when I told people"},"253":{"dur":1,"text":"that I'd left government\nafter two years"},"255":{"dur":2,"text":"because my tenure was\nup-- in other words,"},"257":{"dur":1,"text":"you get a two-year\npublic service leave,"},"259":{"dur":2,"text":"so if you stay another\nyear, you no longer"},"262":{"dur":1,"text":"have a lifetime position."},"263":{"dur":0,"text":"That was fine."},"264":{"dur":1,"text":"Everybody gets that."},"265":{"dur":1,"text":"You don't want to give\nup a tenured position"},"267":{"dur":1,"text":"at a great university."},"269":{"dur":2,"text":"When I told people\nI had come home"},"271":{"dur":3,"text":"because we had two

reaction."},"280":{"dur":2,"text":"I got essentially\nthe reaction that"},"282":{"dur":3,"text":"told me very quickly\nthe person I was talking"},"286":{"dur":2,"text":"to was revaluing me downward."},"288":{"dur":4,"text":"They were thinking, she's not\nthe player I thought she was."},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"And that just wasn't true."},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"My reaction was, no, I\nam doing what I consider"},"297":{"dur":2,"text":"to be the right thing to do."},"299":{"dur":1,"text":"Partly, my kid needed me."},"301":{"dur":3,"text":"But equally, I'm doing\nwhat I want to do,"},"305":{"dur":2,"text":"which is to be there\nwhile they're home."},"307":{"dur":2,"text":"And they won't be home forever."},"309":{"dur":2,"text":"And why on earth am I\ngetting judged this way?"},"312":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's when\nI really thought,"},"314":{"dur":3,"text":"OK, I have been not only telling\npeople they could have it"},"317":{"dur":1,"text":"all if they just\ntried hard enough,"},"319":{"dur":1,"text":"I have also been\npart of the women who"},"320":{"dur":1,"text":"have made those judgments."},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"And now I'm on the\nother side, and I think"},"325":{"dur":3,"text":"it's important to speak out."},"329":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, I never anticipated\nthat the article I wrote"},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"would have the\nimpact it did, but I"},"334":{"dur":4,"text":"did feel like I've\nhad a great career."},"338":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm high enough up\nthat if I say this,"},"341":{"dur":4,"text":"it will have more of an\nimpact than if I'd been home"},"346":{"dur":4,"text":"all the time or if my career\nwas around women's issues."},"350":{"dur":0,"text":"KRISTEN GIL: Yeah."},"351":{"dur":4,"text":"So, if you can then,\ntell us a little bit"},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"about-- in your book, you\ntalk about half truths."},"357":{"dur":2,"text":"KRISTEN GIL: So I want to\nactually get into to your point"},"360":{"dur":2,"text":"about, why is it that people\njudged you as stepping back?"},"363":{"dur":1,"text":"And I want to get into\nthat a little bit,"},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"but first I think we should\nlay the foundation for what"},"367":{"dur":2,"text":"you talk about are the\nhalf truths out there."},"370":{"dur":3,"text":"You list, if you commit enough\nto your career, which you just"},"373":{"dur":2,"text":"said, if you marry\nthe right person,"},"376":{"dur":3,"text":"and also if you\nplanned your career--"},"379":{"dur":1,"text":"ANNE MARIE SLAUGHTER:\nSequence it right, yeah."},"381":{"dur":1,"text":"KRISTEN GIL: Yeah, if you\nsequence everything right"},"382":{"dur":1,"text":"from child rearing, et cetera."},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"Can you talk about why\nthose are half truths?"},"385":{"dur":1,"text":"ANNE-MARIE SLAUGHTER: Yes."},"387":{"dur":3,"text":"So the first one is the\nlean-in proposition."},"390":{"dur":5,"text":"The first one is, if you go hard\nenough, you can make it work."},"396":{"dur":3,"text":"And I will say, and let\nme just start by saying--"},"399":{"dur":3,"text":"and I say in the book-- I\nhave enormous respect for what"},"402":{"dur":1,"text":"Sheryl Sandberg has done."},"404":{"dur":2,"text":"I have personally\nbeen on the other side"},"407":{"dur":3,"text":"of women asking for raises\nbecause they've read the book."},"410":{"dur":2,"text":"And I say in the book that\nwhen that happens-- of course,"},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"as a feminist, I'm thrilled."},"414":{"dur":3,"text":"As a boss, you know, I\ndon't always say yes,"},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"but I respect the\nperson for asking."},"420":{"dur":2,"text":"So I say in the book, when\nthat happens I smile and I"},"423":{"dur":1,"text":"tip my hat to Sheryl Sandberg."},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"And I really feel that strongly."},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is not either\nor, regardless of"},"429":{"dur":1,"text":"what the media may say."},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"And I go out of my\nway to say how much I"},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"respect what she's doing."},"435":{"dur":4,"text":"But it's one piece\nof a larger puzzle."},"439":{"dur":2,"text":"Because it is what I\nalways told people,"},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"but I hit a tipping point."},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"And there is nobody more\ncommitted to their career"},"447":{"dur":1,"text":"than I am."},"449":{"dur":2,"text":"My family would\nhave said, no way."},"451":{"dur":2,"text":"If she had the chance to\nbe promoted in the State"},"454":{"dur":3,"text":"Department and go higher-- there\nare only a few jobs above me,"},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"like Deputy Secretary of State,\nUnder Secretary of State."},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"They're all good jobs."},"462":{"dur":1,"text":"And nobody would\nhave thought that I"},"463":{"dur":1,"text":"would have made a\ndifferent choice,"},"465":{"dur":1,"text":"but I hit a tipping point."},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"I just hit a point at\nwhich it couldn't happen."},"470":{"dur":4,"text":"And so the reason I say\nit's a half truth-- it's"},"474":{"dur":1,"text":"really important to go hard."},"476":{"dur":3,"text":"All the stuff in lean in\nis right, but many of us--"},"480":{"dur":1,"text":"and I was super privileged."},"482":{"dur":3,"text":"I had everything else\ngoing for me-- do hit"},"485":{"dur":1,"text":"an unanticipated tipping point."},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"You can have a child\nwith special needs."},"489":{"dur":1,"text":"You can get divorced."},"490":{"dur":2,"text":"You can move away,\nif you're depending"},"492":{"dur":2,"text":"on your extended family."},"495":{"dur":4,"text":"You can have a teenager who\nturns into an alien, even"},"499":{"dur":1,"text":"more than most teenagers."},"500":{"dur":6,"text":"So my point is, when that\nhappens, it's not your fault."},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"And it's not because\nyou're not ambitious."},"509":{"dur":2,"text":"It's because life happens."},"511":{"dur":2,"text":"And so that's why I\nsay it's a half truth."},"514":{"dur":2,"text":"And the same is true\nwith who you marry."},"516":{"dur":1,"text":"It's incredibly important."},"518":{"dur":1,"text":"Sheryl's right."},"519":{"dur":2,"text":"That's a really\nimportant choice."},"521":{"dur":3,"text":"But I had a lead-parent husband."},"524":{"dur":4,"text":"I had a husband who was\nthere, and still, our kids"},"528":{"dur":2,"text":"needed both of us, hands on."},"531":{"dur":2,"text":"And he's my second husband."},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"He's my final husband."},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"Let me say it here."},"538":{"dur":3,"text":"But I didn't expect to get\ndivorced the first time."},"541":{"dur":2,"text":"Nobody expects to get\ndivorced when you get married."},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"But we didn't have kids\nwhen I got divorced,"},"546":{"dur":5,"text":"but if we had-- you can't\njust always make that choice,"},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"and even when you choose\na great husband, or wife,"},"555":{"dur":4,"text":"and whether a man or a\nwoman, again, things happen."},"559":{"dur":3,"text":"And finally, the sequencing--\nthis should be a whole truth."},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"It should be the\nold thing that says,"},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"you can have it all but\nnot all at the same time."},"568":{"dur":1,"text":"And that's what\nlots of people say."},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"And I say, that's terrific\nand ought to be true,"},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"because we ought to\nbe able to make room"},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"for care and for going hard."},"577":{"dur":3,"text":"And you should be able to\nbe considered for leadership"},"581":{"dur":3,"text":"positions whenever you're\nready as long as the work is"},"584":{"dur":0,"text":"good enough."},"585":{"dur":4,"text":"In fact, lots and lots and lots\nof women who have stepped out,"},"589":{"dur":3,"text":"or work part time, or\nwork from home when"},"592":{"dur":3,"text":"they have caregiving\nobligations, or men, actually"},"596":{"dur":0,"text":"can't get back in."},"597":{"dur":1,"text":"Or they can get back\nin, but they're never"},"599":{"dur":1,"text":"going to be in the same\nplace that they were."},"600":{"dur":3,"text":"So there again,\nit's true in theory,"},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's true for some\nwomen, but for many and many,"},"607":{"dur":0,"text":"it's not."},"608":{"dur":1,"text":"KRISTEN GIL: I think\nthat's so true,"},"609":{"dur":2,"text":"and what I love is I think\nyou have some great policy"},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"ideas on how to\nsolve some of those."},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"But if we could,\nI'd like to hear,"},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"because you also talk\nabout, a bit of the way"},"618":{"dur":2,"text":"it is today is you either\nlean in, or you get out,"},"621":{"dur":1,"text":"or you're pushed out."},"622":{"dur":0,"text":"ANNE-MARIE SLAUGHTER: Or\nyou're shut out, yeah."},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"KRISTEN GIL: But you also\ntalk about this vision of,"},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"we should be able to lean\nin and lean back a bit,"},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"and think about our careers."},"630":{"dur":2,"text":"What I love is you take the\nlong view of the career."},"632":{"dur":2,"text":"We should think about our\ncareers as a portfolio."},"635":{"dur":1,"text":"Can you talk a little\nbit about that vision?"},"636":{"dur":1,"text":"ANNE-MARIE SLAUGHTER:\nYeah, absolutely."},"638":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's two metaphors in the\nbook that I use for careers,"},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"and the first is absolutely\nthat we think about our careers"},"644":{"dur":1,"text":"like interval training."},"646":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you're an athlete, you\nknow, if you go really hard,"},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"then you slow down."},"650":{"dur":1,"text":"You don't go hard all the time."},"651":{"dur":0,"text":"You'll burn out."},"652":{"dur":1,"text":"You'll injure yourself."},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"The whole point is to\ngive yourself rest,"},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"and then you go hard again."},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"And that's how I've thought\nabout my own career."},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"I've changed jobs roughly\nevery five to seven years."},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"And there have been periods\nwhere I've gone all out,"},"665":{"dur":2,"text":"and there have been areas\nwhere I'm always working,"},"668":{"dur":4,"text":"but I'm more focused on having\nkids, on being with my kids,"},"672":{"dur":2,"text":"or on other things that\nI want to do in my life."},"675":{"dur":1,"text":"This isn't just about kids."},"676":{"dur":1,"text":"It's about other\nthings you want to do."},"678":{"dur":2,"text":"So I suggest you think\nabout your career"},"680":{"dur":3,"text":"as a series of\nintervals, some of which"},"683":{"dur":1,"text":"you're really going\nto go all out."},"685":{"dur":1,"text":"And that may be\nwhen you're young"},"686":{"dur":1,"text":"and you don't have\ncaregiving obligations."},"688":{"dur":4,"text":"That may be at a period when\nyour kids, actually, you either"},"692":{"dur":2,"text":"have a spouse is going\nto be a lead parent,"},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"or your kids are just\nin a really good place"},"697":{"dur":3,"text":"But you think about that\nover your lifetime, which"},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"it actually means you're\ngoing to have much more time"},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"for other stuff you want to do."},"705":{"dur":4,"text":"A lot of you are going to\nlive to your 80s, 90s, older,"},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"out here, the end of\ndeath and all that."},"711":{"dur":1,"text":"But we won't go there."},"713":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's assume we haven't\ngotten to the end of death."},"716":{"dur":3,"text":"We still do have\nlong lives, and you"},"719":{"dur":3,"text":"don't want to achieve everything\nby the time you're 60."},"722":{"dur":1,"text":"What are you going to do?"},"724":{"dur":2,"text":"You sit around for 30 years."},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"This is not an\nattractive proposition."},"729":{"dur":1,"text":"And your kids are\nonly young once,"},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"and your parents\nare only old once."},"733":{"dur":4,"text":"So why not take that\ntime to enjoy it and live"},"737":{"dur":1,"text":"that period of life\nto your fullest"},"739":{"dur":3,"text":"and then have time\nto go hard again?"},"742":{"dur":3,"text":"And the second is, I\nthink about careers"},"746":{"dur":3,"text":"as a portfolio of\nskills and experiences."},"749":{"dur":2,"text":"So let's say you\nwanted to be me."},"752":{"dur":1,"text":"You'd look at not\nthe title I hold--"},"754":{"dur":1,"text":"I've had many different titles."},"755":{"dur":4,"text":"But you'd look and you'd\nsay, well, I speak, I write,"},"759":{"dur":4,"text":"I manage, I strategize,\nI fund-raise."},"763":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a whole\nportfolio of skills,"},"766":{"dur":1,"text":"and I've worked in\nthe private-- well,"},"768":{"dur":2,"text":"not really the private\nsector, but the public sector"},"770":{"dur":3,"text":"government, universities,\nand now the nonprofit sector."},"774":{"dur":4,"text":"And really running New America\nis like being an entrepreneur"},"778":{"dur":3,"text":"but just in a nonprofit world\nrather than a for-profit world."},"781":{"dur":3,"text":"You can get those\nskills and experiences"},"784":{"dur":1,"text":"many different ways."},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"You can step out of\nwhere you are now"},"789":{"dur":3,"text":"and run an NGO for\ntwo or three years"},"792":{"dur":2,"text":"while you want to have more\ntime and be your own boss,"},"794":{"dur":3,"text":"and learn how to fund-raise\nand learn how to be a speaker."},"797":{"dur":1,"text":"You can go back to school."},"799":{"dur":2,"text":"You can try your\nhand at writing."},"801":{"dur":3,"text":"So if you think about it as\nintervals and a whole portfolio"},"805":{"dur":3,"text":"of skills and experiences, you\ncan actually equip yourself"},"808":{"dur":2,"text":"for the bigger jobs later\nin life without thinking,"},"811":{"dur":4,"text":"I have to follow a prescribed\nset of progressions."},"816":{"dur":2,"text":"KRISTEN GIL: And I was able to\nrecently-- you were actually"},"818":{"dur":1,"text":"speaking at the\nComputer History Museum,"},"820":{"dur":3,"text":"and I heard you talk\nabout some of the

fact,\ncomparing some of the trainings"},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"One was around\nparenting, and one was"},"832":{"dur":1,"text":"around new manager training."},"833":{"dur":1,"text":"ANNE-MARIE SLAUGHTER: Exactly."},"834":{"dur":1,"text":"Exactly."},"835":{"dur":5,"text":"The thing that I absolutely\ndid not believe three years ago"},"840":{"dur":4,"text":"that I now believe\nis that the skills"},"845":{"dur":7,"text":"of caregiving help you grow and\ndevelop as much as competition"},"852":{"dur":1,"text":"does."},"853":{"dur":2,"text":"And I actually got this\nfrom a male philosopher"},"855":{"dur":2,"text":"who wrote a book called\n\"On Caring\" in the '70s."},"858":{"dur":0,"text":"He's a man."},"859":{"dur":1,"text":"He was a father."},"860":{"dur":2,"text":"And he talks about what\ncaring does for you."},"863":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's entirely\nwritten in a male voice."},"865":{"dur":2,"text":"This has nothing to do\nwith work and family."},"867":{"dur":1,"text":"It's not a\nrationalization of time"},"869":{"dur":2,"text":"spent parenting is going\nto be good for your career."},"872":{"dur":3,"text":"It was talking about\nwhat
