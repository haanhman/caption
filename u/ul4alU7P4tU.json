transition occurs."},"424":{"dur":3,"text":"So that's fall in death\nrate, growth in population"},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"and then later on, a fall\nin the fertility rates"},"430":{"dur":1,"text":"and

then there's this\nhuge increase in growth"},"457":{"dur":3,"text":"in the last century with\njust over seven billion now"},"462":{"dur":3,"text":"and it only took 12 years for\nthe population to

century."},"492":{"dur":3,"text":"And it would bring us to\na population of about nine"},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"or ten million during\nthis century"},"497":{"dur":1,"text":"and then it would plateau."},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"The difference between\nthis high variant"},"502":{"dur":7,"text":"and the medium variant is\njust half birth per woman."},"509":{"dur":3,"text":"So the global

half-a-birth."},"526":{"dur":6,"text":"So you can see that the birth\nrate fell from an average"},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"of five births per woman in 1950"},"536":{"dur":2,"text":"into two-and-a-half\nbirths per woman in 2005."},"539":{"dur":3,"text":"So that half-a-birth difference\nin this century is going"},"543":{"dur":3,"text":"to have a huge impact on\nfinal population
