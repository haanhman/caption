year"},"27":{"dur":3,"text":"where I was invited to speak at\nan entrepreneurial conference."},"30":{"dur":6,"text":"And, you know, I kept\nputting off and putting off"},"37":{"dur":1,"text":"planning this speech."},"39":{"dur":3,"text":"It was just a 10-minute talk,\nbut I was kind of convinced"},"42":{"dur":2,"text":"that I didn't really\nhave anything to share."},"44":{"dur":3,"text":"So I just

it\ndidn't go well I could say,"},"73":{"dur":2,"text":"oh well, I just winged it\nand I didn't really plan."},"75":{"dur":2,"text":"So if I had planned it\nwould have been

way."},"97":{"dur":1,"text":"That wasn't very good."},"98":{"dur":1,"text":"I just winged it."},"100":{"dur":3,"text":"So from the time I finished\nmy speech until about 10:00"},"104":{"dur":2,"text":"PM that night I just\nkept beating myself up."},"106":{"dur":1,"text":"Just negative self talk."},"108":{"dur":1,"text":"Man, you're so

winged it"},"133":{"dur":1,"text":"and I don't think\nit went very well."},"135":{"dur":4,"text":"And he essentially\nwas like, do you mind"},"139":{"dur":1,"text":"if we do guided

that speech was terrible\nin any moment we have a choice"},"159":{"dur":3,"text":"to decide is this thought that's\nrunning through my head useful"},"163":{"dur":1,"text":"or not

wanted"},"190":{"dur":3,"text":"to share because it really made\na huge impact on me and the way"},"193":{"dur":1,"text":"that I look at things."},"195":{"dur":2,"text":"And so please join me

well?"},"209":{"dur":0,"text":"Awesome."},"210":{"dur":3,"text":"So this talk is called\n\"The Fundamental Shift.\""},"214":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'm really planning to\ngive you guys a really, really"},"217":{"dur":1,"text":"tangible fundamental shift."},"218":{"dur":2,"text":"And the subtitle of this is how\nto destroy any limiting belief"},"221":{"dur":3,"text":"and master your mind, which\nmight sound slightly dramatic."},"225":{"dur":1,"text":"It's like master your mind."},"226":{"dur":0,"text":"What is that?"},"227":{"dur":1,"text":"But I'm hoping to make\nthat really tangible"},"229":{"dur":1,"text":"and give you guys a\nprofound understanding"},"230":{"dur":2,"text":"of a different way that we\ncan kind of relate to our mind"},"233":{"dur":2,"text":"and deal with our mind and\nreally tangible tools that Adam"},"235":{"dur":1,"text":"gave an example of right there."},"237":{"dur":2,"text":"Before we dive in,\nI want to really"},"239":{"dur":2,"text":"kind of get down to the\nreality that you guys want"},"242":{"dur":1,"text":"to make a difference, right?"},"244":{"dur":1,"text":"This matters."},"246":{"dur":3,"text":"And you guys are important\nand you're up to cool things."},"249":{"dur":2,"text":"And so to come spend time,\nthis should make a difference."},"251":{"dur":3,"text":"So in that can we set\nan intention together"},"255":{"dur":2,"text":"that maybe we open\nto the possibility"},"258":{"dur":3,"text":"that this talk could\nprofoundly change you."},"261":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a lot of different\nthings that happen."},"263":{"dur":1,"text":"There's a lot different\nthings that we can experience."},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"We could be wasting time\nwatching TV or doing whatever."},"267":{"dur":3,"text":"Some time is more\nvaluable than other time."},"271":{"dur":2,"text":"So I want you to open to\nthe possibility maybe even"},"274":{"dur":1,"text":"in a collective\nbreath or something"},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"that we could all kind of\nset the intention that this"},"278":{"dur":1,"text":"is really profound."},"279":{"dur":1,"text":"That we actually\ndo something that's"},"280":{"dur":3,"text":"really meaningful long\nterm for you guys."},"284":{"dur":1,"text":"So is that possible?"},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"Think about some other powerful\nideas that changed the game."},"288":{"dur":4,"text":"Things like the\nwheel or figuring out"},"293":{"dur":2,"text":"what your next move is,\nwhere you're going to apply,"},"295":{"dur":1,"text":"or maybe meeting\nyour partner in life."},"297":{"dur":2,"text":"Some moments really matter."},"299":{"dur":2,"text":"And so what if I\ncould promise you"},"301":{"dur":3,"text":"a shift caused you not only to\nbecome incredibly productive"},"305":{"dur":3,"text":"but also deeply fulfilled\nat the same time?"},"308":{"dur":2,"text":"Because we've kind of\ngot two worlds going on."},"310":{"dur":3,"text":"We've got the world of being\nand experience and sort"},"314":{"dur":1,"text":"of the art of fulfillment."},"315":{"dur":3,"text":"And then we've got the\ndoing, the success part."},"319":{"dur":1,"text":"And they both really matter."},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"They both really matter."},"323":{"dur":2,"text":"Tony Robbins or somebody like\nthat is awesome at success."},"326":{"dur":3,"text":"And maybe Eckhart Tolle is\nreally awesome at presence."},"329":{"dur":1,"text":"We want to master both."},"330":{"dur":2,"text":"And so for this shift that\nwe're talking about today"},"332":{"dur":2,"text":"it really does apply\nto both of those areas."},"335":{"dur":3,"text":"And so my intention is to\ncreate that space for that shift"},"339":{"dur":1,"text":"in you guys today."},"340":{"dur":3,"text":"And minimally I promise that\nI'm going to share at least one"},"343":{"dur":2,"text":"incredibly valuable idea\nwith you today and probably"},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"many of them."},"348":{"dur":2,"text":"So last little\nintro here is I want"},"350":{"dur":3,"text":"you to relax and just trust that\nyou can get the transmission."},"353":{"dur":2,"text":"We're really, really\ngood at communicating."},"356":{"dur":1,"text":"You don't have to\nfuriously take notes,"},"357":{"dur":2,"text":"although you may choose\nto write some things down."},"360":{"dur":1,"text":"But just relax into this."},"361":{"dur":0,"text":"Let's have fun."},"362":{"dur":3,"text":"Let's enjoy this time and\nmake it really valuable, OK?"},"365":{"dur":2,"text":"So things that I'm going\nto cover today quickly,"},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to share a\nlittle bit more about me."},"368":{"dur":1,"text":"Many of you probably\nhave no idea who I am."},"370":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I want to let you\nknow a little bit about why"},"372":{"dur":1,"text":"I get to come and talk to you."},"374":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm going to talk\nand share with you"},"376":{"dur":1,"text":"through hopefully a\nvisualization you'll"},"378":{"dur":3,"text":"join me in the cost of\nour limiting beliefs."},"382":{"dur":2,"text":"We're going to talk about\nwhere these beliefs come from,"},"384":{"dur":3,"text":"because it's really important\nto understand how insidious"},"387":{"dur":2,"text":"and kind of sneaky they can be."},"390":{"dur":2,"text":"And I'm going to share with\nyou some of the reasons why"},"392":{"dur":1,"text":"we can't see them."},"394":{"dur":2,"text":"How do we get in touch with\nthem when we don't even"},"396":{"dur":1,"text":"know they're there."},"397":{"dur":2,"text":"Is it possible you're\ncarrying a limiting belief"},"399":{"dur":1,"text":"and you don't even\nknow you have it."},"401":{"dur":1,"text":"It just feels like\na truth to you."},"403":{"dur":2,"text":"And then we're going to talk\nabout the single change that"},"405":{"dur":1,"text":"shifts everything."},"407":{"dur":2,"text":"Some things you should\ntake away is really"},"409":{"dur":1,"text":"how to master your beliefs."},"411":{"dur":3,"text":"After this talk I want you guys\nto have access to mastering"},"415":{"dur":1,"text":"your own belief structures."},"416":{"dur":2,"text":"I want you to understand\nthis concept of lenses"},"419":{"dur":1,"text":"that I'm going to go\ninto in depth today."},"421":{"dur":3,"text":"We're going to talk about a\nformula for procrastination."},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"There's actually a\nformula that kind of"},"426":{"dur":2,"text":"explains why we choose\nto procrastinate"},"428":{"dur":2,"text":"or why we feel resistance\nwhen we're trying to do"},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"some important piece of work."},"433":{"dur":3,"text":"And we're going to get\ninto impostor syndrome."},"436":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't know if any of\nyou ever feel slightly"},"438":{"dur":1,"text":"fraudulent or worried\nthat maybe they'll"},"440":{"dur":4,"text":"find out that I'm really not as\nspecial as I like to think I am"},"445":{"dur":1,"text":"or that I hope they think I am."},"446":{"dur":1,"text":"So we're going to talk\nabout impostor syndrome."},"448":{"dur":2,"text":"And then other things\nlike core story,"},"450":{"dur":3,"text":"meaning making, where you get\ninto it what truth is actually"},"453":{"dur":0,"text":"in this talk."},"454":{"dur":3,"text":"But the most important takeaway\nis the fundamental shift"},"457":{"dur":2,"text":"that changes everything."},"459":{"dur":3,"text":"So why should you listen to me?"},"462":{"dur":1,"text":"Why would you spend this time?"},"464":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, I'm Rob Scott and\nI wish that was enough."},"467":{"dur":2,"text":"But there's probably\nmore to it than that."},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"I went through some really\nmajor abuse as a child."},"472":{"dur":1,"text":"And not to be overly\ngraphic or whatever,"},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"but there was a period of\ntime from like three or four"},"477":{"dur":3,"text":"to about eight or nine where\nI was actually being raped"},"480":{"dur":3,"text":"and just really violently\nsexually abused, et cetera."},"483":{"dur":2,"text":"And not only that,\nbut other dysfunctions"},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"in the family and addiction in\nthe family and all that stuff."},"488":{"dur":3,"text":"These things left me scarred\nphysically, emotionally,"},"491":{"dur":2,"text":"I basically didn't feel safe."},"494":{"dur":5,"text":"I didn't have a lot\nof emotional maturity."},"500":{"dur":2,"text":"I kind of got stunted in\na lot of ways emotionally"},"502":{"dur":0,"text":"and in other things."},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I turned to\ndrugs and alcohol,"},"506":{"dur":2,"text":"starting to play with them\nas early as 7-years-old."},"508":{"dur":3,"text":"And when I had my first\nnephew in my life,"},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"when I looked at how\nold he was at seven,"},"513":{"dur":3,"text":"and now I have a boy in my\nlife through my girlfriend"},"516":{"dur":3,"text":"and my partner who's six, it\njust kind of blows my mind"},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"that that was what was\ngoing on for me at that age."},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"And so later that\ngrew into me being"},"525":{"dur":5,"text":"in and out of institutions and\njails and just a ton of chaos"},"531":{"dur":1,"text":"and I ended up homeless."},"532":{"dur":2,"text":"I was not able to\ndeal with life."},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"So I was horribly dysfunctional."},"537":{"dur":2,"text":"Like pretty much as bad\nas it gets without dying."},"539":{"dur":2,"text":"I had a lot of people\naround me that died,"},"542":{"dur":3,"text":"commit suicide, gun fights, all\nkinds of crazy stuff like that."},"545":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I was living\nas a victim and I"},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"was unable to deal\nwith my own life."},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"And after all that\nwas going on and I"},"552":{"dur":2,"text":"began trying to get\nmy life back together,"},"555":{"dur":3,"text":"I had my next challenge and I\ngot really sick with cancer."},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"And so here's a picture of\nme going through chemotherapy"},"562":{"dur":1,"text":"and smoking."},"563":{"dur":1,"text":"And right above that\nwhich is out of frame"},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"is a No Smoking sign."},"567":{"dur":3,"text":"So that was the kind\nof guy that I was."},"571":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm rolling my chemo dose\noutside to smoke back then."},"576":{"dur":1,"text":"So that was what was going on."},"577":{"dur":1,"text":"My mom actually\nworked close to where"},"579":{"dur":0,"text":"I was getting this treatment."},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"And I didn't know\nshe was walking up"},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"but she came up and just\ntook a picture of me"},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's what this is."},"584":{"dur":4,"text":"So I know what it is to\nbe really sick mentally,"},"589":{"dur":1,"text":"emotionally, and physically."},"590":{"dur":0,"text":"I'm in touch with that."},"591":{"dur":3,"text":"And from that abuse and sickness\nand homelessness and addiction"},"595":{"dur":1,"text":"and all that stuff,\nwhat happened?"},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"Well I had a profound\nshift in awareness."},"600":{"dur":2,"text":"Somewhere along the way I\nreally woke up to the victim"},"602":{"dur":0,"text":"that I was doing."},"603":{"dur":2,"text":"And I realized that nobody\nwas punching me anymore."},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"Nobody was doing anything, but\nI was carrying a story with me"},"608":{"dur":1,"text":"that was no longer empowering."},"610":{"dur":5,"text":"It was very, very difficult\nto function because poor me."},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"Look at all I've been through."},"616":{"dur":1,"text":"And I really woke up to that."},"617":{"dur":1,"text":"And it was deeply profound."},"619":{"dur":2,"text":"And a new level of consciousness\nbecame available to me."},"622":{"dur":3,"text":"I didn't relate to my brain\nin the same way again."},"625":{"dur":2,"text":"And from then just a few short\nyears I went from being a temp,"},"628":{"dur":2,"text":"like my first attempt to getting\na job after being homeless"},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"was filing papers in the\nbasement of a company."},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"And a few years after that\nI became the youngest vice"},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"president-- I had moved\ncompanies-- but it"},"638":{"dur":1,"text":"was a different company."},"639":{"dur":1,"text":"And I was running\ntechnology and building"},"641":{"dur":1,"text":"and I built and\nsold a big business"},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"for them, a big software\ncompany, and all that."},"645":{"dur":2,"text":"And so I learned to\nmanage myself and others"},"647":{"dur":2,"text":"and started to get really\nincredible results."},"650":{"dur":3,"text":"But I also felt deep\nfulfilment and happiness."},"653":{"dur":3,"text":"There was a being and doing that\nwas really addressed in this."},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"So in 2005 I started\na podcast where"},"658":{"dur":2,"text":"I was sharing ideas\nabout conscious evolution"},"661":{"dur":2,"text":"and what is it, what's\nhypnosis, and what's NLP,"},"663":{"dur":2,"text":"and what are all these things\nabout managing our brain"},"665":{"dur":1,"text":"and getting better results?"},"666":{"dur":2,"text":"And people all over the world\nstarted asking me for coaching."},"669":{"dur":2,"text":"So Japan and Australia\nand Ireland and Canada"},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"and a lot in the United States."},"673":{"dur":4,"text":"And so about a decade ago\nI left the corporate world"},"678":{"dur":3,"text":"to start this company where\nI get to help people and help"},"681":{"dur":1,"text":"them get better\nresults, help them"},"682":{"dur":3,"text":"resolve a lot of inner\nconflict, and just grow."},"686":{"dur":1,"text":"So I know what it\ntakes to change."},"688":{"dur":2,"text":"I've done it myself and I've\nhelped thousands of others"},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"do it, as well."},"691":{"dur":3,"text":"And what it really takes\nis this fundamental shift"},"695":{"dur":1,"text":"that I'm going to be\nsharing with you today."},"697":{"dur":2,"text":"So are you guys ready\nto dive in on this?"},"699":{"dur":1,"text":"Do you want to know\nmore about this?"},"700":{"dur":2,"text":"And does this sound important?"},"702":{"dur":0,"text":"AUDIENCE: Yes."},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"ROB SCOTT: I get\nlike quiet nods."},"704":{"dur":0,"text":"That's awesome."},"705":{"dur":0,"text":"How about a little louder?"},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"Do you want to hear\nabout this or no?"},"707":{"dur":0,"text":"AUDIENCE: Yes."},"708":{"dur":0,"text":"Awesome."},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"So when people hire me, when\npeople come to work with me,"},"712":{"dur":3,"text":"they often want very\ndifferent things."},"716":{"dur":5,"text":"But there's three or so\nflavors of what people want."},"721":{"dur":2,"text":"First they want often better\nstuff to happen in their life."},"723":{"dur":0,"text":"They want better events."},"724":{"dur":0,"text":"They want to get the house."},"725":{"dur":1,"text":"They want to get\nthe girl or guy."},"727":{"dur":1,"text":"They want to have the new job."},"728":{"dur":2,"text":"They want better events\nto happen in their world."},"731":{"dur":2,"text":"The next one is they\nwant to feel better."},"733":{"dur":2,"text":"Some people come to me and they\ngo, I'm anxious all the time."},"736":{"dur":1,"text":"How can you help me\nbe more confident?"},"738":{"dur":1,"text":"Or I'm depressed."},"739":{"dur":2,"text":"I can't figure out\nhappiness, et cetera."},"741":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's this focus on state\nand how they feel that way."},"744":{"dur":2,"text":"And then the last one is many\npeople come and they're like,"},"747":{"dur":2,"text":"I can't stick to my habits\nor I can't break this habit."},"750":{"dur":2,"text":"I want to work out all\nthe time but I can't."},"752":{"dur":1,"text":"So they want\ndifferent behaviors."},"754":{"dur":1,"text":"And I just want to show\na little bit of a model"},"756":{"dur":3,"text":"here for you guys\nabout how this works."},"759":{"dur":2,"text":"Events happen out there, and of\ncourse we want different ones,"},"762":{"dur":2,"text":"but as events happen\nto us they end up"},"765":{"dur":1,"text":"making us feel a certain way."},"767":{"dur":3,"text":"And so these events lead\nto a certain state for us."},"770":{"dur":2,"text":"Events happen, we\nsort of have them,"},"773":{"dur":1,"text":"they make us feel a certain way."},"774":{"dur":2,"text":"If we feel a certain\nway, that affects what?"},"777":{"dur":1,"text":"So events affect our state."},"779":{"dur":3,"text":"Our state affects our behaviors."},"782":{"dur":2,"text":"And if I'm confident I'll\ntake different behaviors"},"785":{"dur":1,"text":"than if I'm anxious\nabout something"},"786":{"dur":1,"text":"or if I'm fearful,\nif I'm depressed."},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"That's going to change what\nI choose to do in the world."},"790":{"dur":2,"text":"And then our behaviors,\nto whatever degree,"},"792":{"dur":1,"text":"affects our events."},"793":{"dur":1,"text":"It doesn't have total\ncontrol over it."},"794":{"dur":0,"text":"None of these do."},"795":{"dur":2,"text":"But this is a loop of\nhow our life goes by."},"798":{"dur":1,"text":"Events happen."},"799":{"dur":1,"text":"It creates a certain\nfeeling in us."},"801":{"dur":1,"text":"That creates certain behavior."},"802":{"dur":0,"text":"We get new events."},"803":{"dur":1,"text":"And that goes on like that."},"805":{"dur":2,"text":"So let's be clear."},"807":{"dur":1,"text":"We want all of it."},"809":{"dur":2,"text":"We actually want better\nevents to happen in our life."},"811":{"dur":2,"text":"We also want better\nstate experiences."},"814":{"dur":3,"text":"And we also want more\ncontrol over our behavior."},"817":{"dur":3,"text":"And there's one\nplace on that slide"},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"that we're going to make a\nslight addition to later that's"},"823":{"dur":1,"text":"going to be the game changer."},"824":{"dur":1,"text":"So this slide you'll be\nseeing it again later."},"826":{"dur":1,"text":"And there's one\nplace where we're"},"827":{"dur":1,"text":"going to make a\nbig change there,"},"829":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'll share\nwhat that is later."},"831":{"dur":3,"text":"Before we really get\nstarted, I want to find out"},"834":{"dur":2,"text":"what limiting beliefs cost us."},"836":{"dur":3,"text":"And I'd like to do that kind\nof experientially if that's OK."},"839":{"dur":1,"text":"So if you guys are\nopen to it, would you"},"841":{"dur":2,"text":"do a visualization with me?"},"843":{"dur":0,"text":"Yeah?"},"844":{"dur":1,"text":"Again, really quiet."},"846":{"dur":0,"text":"Yes?"},"847":{"dur":0,"text":"AUDIENCE: Yes."},"848":{"dur":0,"text":"All
