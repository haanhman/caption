I'll give little examples and then you can go off on your own."},"967":{"dur":4,"text":"White wines are typically made from green grapes."},"971":{"dur":3,"text":"So this is like a grape that's the color green."},"974":{"dur":3,"text":"And the way the white wine more precisely is made is they'll press the grape"},"978":{"dur":3,"text":"and they'll make the wine from the juice itself."},"981":{"dur":4,"text":"They basically add yeast which can convert the sugar in the grape juice to alcohol,"},"986":{"dur":3,"text":"sugar disappears and then that becomes a wine."},"989":{"dur":3,"text":"There's also an exception."},"993":{"dur":3,"text":"So white wines are usually made from\ngreen grapes but not always."},"997":{"dur":4,"text":"I'll show you an exception of this, I'll give you two examples of exceptions."},"1001":{"dur":5,"text":"So basically it's possible to make white wine from red grapes, but typically it's from the green grapes."},"1006":{"dur":3,"text":"First example: Riesling"},"1009":{"dur":5,"text":"So this might not be the most popular varietal out there,"},"1015":{"dur":5,"text":"but the reason I mention it is that it's typically sweet, it's typically easy to drink"},"1020":{"dur":2,"text":"and it's a good starter wine."},"1023":{"dur":2,"text":"So if there are any of you in here who have never really had wine before"},"1025":{"dur":2,"text":"I strongly suggest to start with the riesling"},"1027":{"dur":6,"text":"It's like slightly punched fruit juice."},"1034":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's great with spicy food."},"1036":{"dur":5,"text":"So spicy food I'll mention toward the end is actually pretty hard to pair with wines"},"1042":{"dur":4,"text":"but if you add sweetness to it, it becomes much easier to pair with."},"1047":{"dur":4,"text":"So riesling actually goes really well with Indian food, Thai, Mexican food."},"1051":{"dur":2,"text":"Whereas I pretty much would not match any other wine with it."},"1054":{"dur":4,"text":"So sweet wines go with spicy foods."},"1058":{"dur":4,"text":"Sauvignon Blanc is another type of white wine, another varietal."},"1063":{"dur":3,"text":"This is one that is typically acidic"},"1067":{"dur":3,"text":"so it has more acidity than other types\nof wines"},"1070":{"dur":3,"text":"and that's good because it usually goes\nwell with food"},"1073":{"dur":3,"text":"on as long as it's not spicy it\ntypically goes pretty well."},"1076":{"dur":3,"text":"And the acidity acts like lemon juice that you\nput on seafood."},"1079":{"dur":1,"text":"The acidity brings out the flavor"},"1081":{"dur":3,"text":"So the acidity from the white wine helps you taste the food a little bit better."},"1085":{"dur":4,"text":"So that's a good default if you're trying to match with food."},"1089":{"dur":3,"text":"And then there's Chardonnay."},"1093":{"dur":3,"text":"And Chardonnay, I'm sure you guys have heard of,"},"1096":{"dur":3,"text":"is probably one the most versatile white\nwines."},"1099":{"dur":5,"text":"So it's hard to even describe what\nit is because it can be many different things."},"1104":{"dur":3,"text":"So for example if you get a Chardonnay\nfrom California"},"1108":{"dur":4,"text":"typically they're described as buttery and oaky."},"1113":{"dur":4,"text":"If you smell it, you smell wood because\nthey're typically stored and aged in oak barrels"},"1117":{"dur":3,"text":"so the oak barrel imparts its flavor into the\nwine."},"1121":{"dur":4,"text":"In contrast, the Chablis region from France makes Chardonnays"},"1126":{"dur":3,"text":"but they don't really store it in oak, they store it in stainless steel"},"1129":{"dur":3,"text":"so it doesn't have any of the butteriness, doesn't have any of the oakness"},"1133":{"dur":4,"text":"and it tastes completely different."},"1137":{"dur":3,"text":"So there's huge variety."},"1141":{"dur":6,"text":"And there's one last grape I want to mention: Pinot Grigio."},"1147":{"dur":4,"text":"So I want to talk about Pinot Grigio versus Pinot Blanc."},"1151":{"dur":2,"text":"So Pinot Blanc looks like this."},"1154":{"dur":2,"text":"It's a green grape, it makes a white wine."},"1157":{"dur":4,"text":"But Pinot Grigio is also known as Pinot\nGris."},"1162":{"dur":4,"text":"So grigio is Italian for grey, and gris is French for grey."},"1166":{"dur":2,"text":"It's like the grey pinot."},"1168":{"dur":1,"text":"It looks like this, it's kinda like a red grape."},"1170":{"dur":4,"text":"They will make white wine from this red grape."},"1174":{"dur":5,"text":"Basically press out all the grape juice, throw away the skins, and they make a white wine from that."},"1180":{"dur":2,"text":"So even though you might be a familiar\nwith Pinot Grigio"},"1182":{"dur":3,"text":"it's a pretty popular white wine from Italy,"},"1185":{"dur":3,"text":"it's actually made from a red grape."},"1189":{"dur":4,"text":"So those are samples of white wine varietals"},"1193":{"dur":3,"text":"there's a lot more, but just to get you started"},"1197":{"dur":3,"text":"So let's go back here"},"1200":{"dur":5,"text":"Let's see how those varietals fit into this scale of colors."},"1206":{"dur":3,"text":"So Pinot Grigio is typically pretty transparent."},"1209":{"dur":3,"text":"Pretty low amount of color."},"1212":{"dur":4,"text":"Sometimes, and I've seen them before, some Pinot Grigios look almost like
