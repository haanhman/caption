my favorite movements,\nI like the bear, the bear walk and just to"},"156":{"dur":4,"text":"let you know for those of you who aren\u2019t\naware of some of these animal movements, the"},"161":{"dur":2,"text":"bear walk is basically where you have your\narms straight and your legs straight with"},"163":{"dur":1,"text":"your butt up into the air."},"165":{"dur":4,"text":"It kind of looks like an A and that\u2019s why\nwhen we teach it, we say to start off with"},"170":{"dur":1,"text":"the A frame."},"171":{"dur":2,"text":"That\u2019s just kind of the position you want\nto do."},"173":{"dur":3,"text":"Andy: We should just go on at this point and\nsay that a lot of these have different names"},"177":{"dur":1,"text":"in different place."},"178":{"dur":1,"text":"Ryan: Yeah."},"179":{"dur":3,"text":"Andy: Ryan will be teaching the bear and somebody\nwill say, \u201cThat\u2019s the monkey, you idiot!\u201d"},"183":{"dur":1,"text":"Ryan: Exactly right."},"184":{"dur":2,"text":"So I mean whatever."},"186":{"dur":3,"text":"This is just a name that we put on it."},"189":{"dur":2,"text":"Feel free to call it whatever you want."},"191":{"dur":1,"text":"OK?"},"192":{"dur":2,"text":"It\u2019s just movement."},"194":{"dur":2,"text":"So anyway, I like to call that the bear walk."},"196":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, recently \u2013 actually I think it was\n\u2013 it was on the forum, actually our forum."},"202":{"dur":2,"text":"Someone was talking about bear crawls in the\ndiscussion."},"205":{"dur":1,"text":"What\u2019s the difference between the two?"},"206":{"dur":6,"text":"Well, in the bear crawl, apparently the bear\ncrawl has your legs bent with your butt \u2013 and"},"212":{"dur":1,"text":"it\u2019s lowered."},"213":{"dur":2,"text":"I actually call that the catwalk."},"215":{"dur":3,"text":"So again, it really doesn\u2019t matter what\nit\u2019s called just as long as you understand"},"218":{"dur":1,"text":"what is happening within the movement."},"220":{"dur":4,"text":"So we got the bear walk, which your legs and\nyour arms are straight and we will talk about"},"225":{"dur":1,"text":"some variations later."},"226":{"dur":1,"text":"But there are many different variations."},"228":{"dur":3,"text":"The second one that I absolutely love, what\nI call the monkey."},"232":{"dur":3,"text":"So you\u2019re sitting in as deep as a squat\nas you can."},"235":{"dur":5,"text":"You place your hands to the side and you put\nweight on to your arms in order to jump your"},"240":{"dur":3,"text":"body to the side and land in a squat again."},"244":{"dur":3,"text":"So you\u2019re traversing laterally, performing\nthe monkey."},"247":{"dur":3,"text":"Something that\u2019s very similar to that, which\nis also one of my favorite movements, is called"},"251":{"dur":1,"text":"the \u201cfrogger\u201d."},"252":{"dur":5,"text":"Now for those of you our age, you will probably\nremember the Frogger video game."},"257":{"dur":3,"text":"I remember playing that in a Godfather\u2019s\nPizza all the time when I was young."},"261":{"dur":1,"text":"Andy: Yes."},"262":{"dur":1,"text":"Ryan: Frogger, baby."},"263":{"dur":2,"text":"So basically all you\u2019re trying to do is\nyou\u2019re just hopping forward."},"266":{"dur":4,"text":"So it\u2019s just like the monkey but you\u2019re\ngoing forward or even backward, depending"},"271":{"dur":1,"text":"on what you\u2019re after."},"272":{"dur":3,"text":"Andy: Can we just stop talking about locomotor\npatterns and start talking about like those"},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"tabletop video games from the pizza joint?"},"277":{"dur":1,"text":"Because that\u2019s a much better show topic."},"279":{"dur":1,"text":"Ryan: Seriously."},"280":{"dur":1,"text":"And we would \u2013 oh, let\u2019s just \u2013 OK."},"282":{"dur":1,"text":"We\u2019re done talking about animal movements."},"284":{"dur":1,"text":"Galaxy, baby."},"285":{"dur":2,"text":"That was just \u2013 that was it."},"287":{"dur":1,"text":"That\u2019s where it was."},"289":{"dur":2,"text":"Anyway, we probably should go back to it."},"292":{"dur":1,"text":"Andy: Sorry to interrupt."},"293":{"dur":1,"text":"[Music]\nAndy: OK."},"295":{"dur":6,"text":"So yeah, so the bear, the monkey, the frogger,\nthese are the ones that we use a lot and we"},"302":{"dur":1,"text":"use a lot of other ones."},"304":{"dur":3,"text":"But these three, we use a lot of."},"307":{"dur":9,"text":"So let\u2019s talk a little bit about why those\nthree \u2013 maybe why we use these locomotor"},"316":{"dur":8,"text":"patterns instead of just a more traditional\ncallisthenic movement or exercise."},"325":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe more generally and then let\u2019s get\nto the specific moves."},"328":{"dur":1,"text":"Ryan: OK."},"329":{"dur":1,"text":"OK."},"330":{"dur":3,"text":"Well, the way that we like to look at it is\nwe break things into three groups."},"333":{"dur":1,"text":"We have the strength."},"335":{"dur":3,"text":"We have the flexibility and then we have the\nmotor control."},"338":{"dur":5,"text":"So in the very beginning when you\u2019re starting\na movement, we first want to see if you can"},"343":{"dur":1,"text":"actually get into one of these movements."},"345":{"dur":3,"text":"So looking at the bear, why would we want\nto use the bear?"},"348":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, the bear is a good way to check and\nsee how a person\u2019s flexibility is in their"},"354":{"dur":5,"text":"hamstrings and their lower back, even their\nwrist and their shoulders and to prep them"},"359":{"dur":4,"text":"to actually start to get them ready to train\nother things."},"364":{"dur":2,"text":"So it can be an assessment of sorts, right?"},"366":{"dur":2,"text":"So this is kind of how we like to use it."},"368":{"dur":4,"text":"So imagine a person who has been sedative\n[0:06:10] [Phonetic] for quite a while and"},"372":{"dur":6,"text":"this could be a person who up through high\nschool and even maybe a little bit in university"},"379":{"dur":1,"text":"played some sport."},"381":{"dur":1,"text":"But they took a break."},"382":{"dur":3,"text":"They go and they start working again and maybe\nthey\u2019ve been sitting in their chair for"},"386":{"dur":1,"text":"the past 10 some years."},"387":{"dur":3,"text":"They want to get back into working out."},"390":{"dur":4,"text":"Just jumping right into a workout might not\nbe the best thing for them."},"395":{"dur":5,"text":"Well, using these animal movements, you can\nkind of work your way back into being able"},"401":{"dur":3,"text":"to get your body, so that it\u2019s prepared\nto move."},"404":{"dur":1,"text":"That\u2019s just one example."},"405":{"dur":1,"text":"Of course there are tons of different examples\nof how to do it."},"407":{"dur":1,"text":"But this is how we like to use it."},"408":{"dur":3,"text":"So again, we have the strength, flexibility,\nand the motor skills."},"412":{"dur":5,"text":"The strength portion of it is loading the\nbody by just using your body weight and then"},"418":{"dur":4,"text":"putting it into motion which is the motor\nskill component, the motor control."},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"Basically do you have control over your body?"},"425":{"dur":7,"text":"Are you able to basically walk and move around\nin these animal patterns?"},"432":{"dur":3,"text":"So very broad way of looking at it is that\nway."},"436":{"dur":4,"text":"Another thing too, they\u2019re kind of fun and\nso when you\u2019re performing them, you don\u2019t"},"441":{"dur":1,"text":"have to worry about repetitions."},"442":{"dur":1,"text":"Andy: Yeah."},"443":{"dur":1,"text":"Ryan: Right?"},"444":{"dur":4,"text":"So we like to do this and look at it in time,\nso setting your clock for a specific amount"},"449":{"dur":3,"text":"of time and just moving your body."},"453":{"dur":4,"text":"Not even worrying about repetitions, but just\ntrying to work towards a particular amount"},"457":{"dur":1,"text":"of time."},"458":{"dur":3,"text":"So that\u2019s just one example of why we like\nto use them."},"462":{"dur":1,"text":"Andy: Yeah."},"463":{"dur":3,"text":"I also think there\u2019s \u2013 there are other\nbenefits too."},"466":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean not to any specific move but locomotor\nmovements in general."},"471":{"dur":2,"text":"Well, one, you\u2019re coordinating your whole\nbody."},"473":{"dur":4,"text":"We always like to talk about you practice\nmovements, not muscles, and some people will"},"478":{"dur":3,"text":"say, \u201cWell, the pull-up, yeah, you don\u2019t\nreally use your legs,\u201d and yeah, it\u2019s"},"481":{"dur":1,"text":"debatable."},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"You can use your legs in a pull-up or whatever."},"484":{"dur":4,"text":"But when you talk about crawling around on\nthe floor or rolling or sliding around or"},"488":{"dur":4,"text":"whatever, any of these movements you can see\nvery quickly and very easily how it uses the"},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"whole body in a coordinated fashion, right?"},"495":{"dur":4,"text":"You\u2019re talking about leg and arm strength,\nflexibility and control, all of them happening"},"500":{"dur":5,"text":"at the same time and there\u2019s something very\ncool about that."},"505":{"dur":5,"text":"People can see not just if I squat a lot,\nthen I will have stronger legs which will"},"511":{"dur":3,"text":"make me more solid for anything I\u2019m doing\nstanding up."},"514":{"dur":1,"text":"All right."},"515":{"dur":1,"text":"That\u2019s great."},"516":{"dur":1,"text":"Squats are wonderful for that."},"517":{"dur":4,"text":"But being able to squat down and then jump\nand crawl around on the floor, people can"},"521":{"dur":5,"text":"see easily and feel how they might apply that\nin a situation where they have to crawl under"},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"something, duck under a table and grab something."},"529":{"dur":4,"text":"You know, crawl behind something to \u2013 you\nknow, anything."},"533":{"dur":6,"text":"But these movements resemble \u2013 well, they\nare, but they resemble movements that we will"},"540":{"dur":4,"text":"probably use at some point in life and one\nof the things I love about teaching these"},"544":{"dur":6,"text":"is that people can see the applicability a\nlot faster than they can with something like"},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"a muscle-up."},"552":{"dur":1,"text":"Ryan: Exactly."},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"Andy: I mean muscle-up, they say, \u201cWell,\nif you ever need to pull yourself up onto"},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"a ledge.\u201d"},"556":{"dur":2,"text":"How many times have you ever pulled yourself\nup onto a damn ledge?"},"559":{"dur":2,"text":"Ryan: But how many times do you have to get\nup and off the ground, right?"},"562":{"dur":1,"text":"Andy: Yeah."},"563":{"dur":1,"text":"Ryan: So yeah."},"564":{"dur":1,"text":"Andy: If you do parkour, you pull yourself\nup on the ledges a lot."},"566":{"dur":2,"text":"If you\u2019re a firefighter, yeah, whatever,\ngreat."},"568":{"dur":1,"text":"That\u2019s wonderful."},"569":{"dur":1,"text":"It\u2019s important for those situations."},"570":{"dur":1,"text":"Ryan: Yeah."},"571":{"dur":4,"text":"Andy: But like a muscle-up does not have the\nobvious applicability of something like a"},"576":{"dur":1,"text":"bear crawl, right?"},"577":{"dur":5,"text":"So that to me I think is maybe the biggest\nbenefit for anyone."},"583":{"dur":5,"text":"You can try these movements, feel how strong,\nhow flexible, how coordinated you feel, and"},"588":{"dur":5,"text":"know in similar movements, similar motions\nand similar applications how strong, flexible,"},"594":{"dur":2,"text":"and coordinated you might be in the real world."},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"So it gives you a great, like you said, assessment."},"599":{"dur":5,"text":"But it gives you just a great way to benchmark\nand know where you\u2019re personally at."},"604":{"dur":6,"text":"I think that is maybe the most valuable part\nfrom the perspective of someone training."},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"Ryan: I love that."},"612":{"dur":1,"text":"Yeah."},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"I mean it\u2019s practical, right?"},"615":{"dur":4,"text":"And then because \u2013 you mentioned you can\ntake it into crawling and going behind things."},"620":{"dur":1,"text":"It\u2019s also very tactical."},"621":{"dur":1,"text":"Andy: It\u2019s very tactical."},"622":{"dur":2,"text":"Ryan: It\u2019s very tactical and yeah."},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"I won\u2019t get into that."},"627":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah, a good point though."},"629":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean \u2013 and this is the thing."},"632":{"dur":5,"text":"You don\u2019t need anything of course to do\nthis but like you mentioned before, it\u2019s"},"637":{"dur":3,"text":"going to be a good gauge as to what\u2019s going\non with your body."},"640":{"dur":1,"text":"You will know."},"641":{"dur":4,"text":"I mean you will get down and you\u2019re on your\nknees and you\u2019re on your hands and you try"},"646":{"dur":1,"text":"and crawl around."},"647":{"dur":3,"text":"You\u2019re going to feel like, \u201cOh, you know\nwhat?"},"650":{"dur":5,"text":"I\u2019m not able to really maybe do something,\u201d\nor maybe you find that you\u2019re able to do"},"655":{"dur":1,"text":"something that you didn\u2019t think you could."},"657":{"dur":6,"text":"Andy: You might find that you can do something\nbut you can\u2019t do it for more than 60 solid"},"663":{"dur":1,"text":"seconds."},"664":{"dur":1,"text":"Ryan: Sure."},"665":{"dur":3,"text":"Andy: That\u2019s something that surprises a\nlot of people who say, \u201cOh, this is easy.\u201d"},"668":{"dur":1,"text":"Ryan: Yeah."},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"[Music]\nRyan: These are some things \u2013 I mean we"},"672":{"dur":5,"text":"cover these in our seminars and of course\nlike everything, we start with the basics."},"678":{"dur":3,"text":"But there are so many different variations\nof this movement, of these movements."},"681":{"dur":1,"text":"Why?"},"682":{"dur":1,"text":"Because it\u2019s really \u2013 it\u2019s endless."},"684":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean you can create \u2026\nAndy: Well, it\u2019s evolution."},"686":{"dur":1,"text":"Ryan: That\u2019s right, exactly."},"687":{"dur":1,"text":"Andy: Look at all the animals."},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"All of them move."},"689":{"dur":1,"text":"Ryan: Yeah."},"690":{"dur":3,"text":"Andy: So therefore animal movements are extremely\nvaried."},"694":{"dur":4,"text":"We\u2019ve got my favorite that I think is underserved\nis the penguin walk."},"699":{"dur":4,"text":"Ryan: The penguin walk very \u2013 when you\u2019ve\nhad too much to drink, it will really help"},"703":{"dur":1,"text":"you out."},"704":{"dur":3,"text":"Andy: Well, people don\u2019t realize it\u2019s\nan excellent way to improve dorsiflexion."},"708":{"dur":2,"text":"It\u2019s a straight leg strength."},"711":{"dur":4,"text":"Ryan: Just trying not to laugh, man."},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"You ruined it."},"716":{"dur":1,"text":"You ruined it."},"717":{"dur":1,"text":"Andy: Oh, that, sorry."},"719":{"dur":1,"text":"Ryan: No, but that\u2019s good."},"721":{"dur":8,"text":"We\u2019re joking around but the thing is really\nit\u2019s \u2013 it would be very easy for us to"},"730":{"dur":3,"text":"just say, \u201cYeah, just get on the ground\nand move around and do,\u201d kind of thing."},"733":{"dur":5,"text":"But of course we do need to show you a few\nthings and explain how to do it in order for"},"738":{"dur":2,"text":"you to get some good results out of it."},"741":{"dur":2,"text":"So \u2026\nAndy: On the other side of the coin, we could"},"743":{"dur":8,"text":"also contrive like a thousand variations of\nesoteric movements and that\u2019s useful because"},"752":{"dur":2,"text":"you never run out of things to do and that\u2019s\nhandy."},"755":{"dur":4,"text":"It\u2019s good to have certain codified things\nwhere you can say, \u201cOK."},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"Given this bear pattern, what happens if we\nbend our legs now?"},"762":{"dur":1,"text":"What happens if we bend our arms?"},"764":{"dur":6,"text":"What happens if we change the timing or move\nin a circular arc pattern instead of a straight"},"770":{"dur":1,"text":"pattern?\u201d"},"771":{"dur":5,"text":"All of these variations are really good but\ninstead of getting too complex with things"},"776":{"dur":4,"text":"to the point where your goal is to do the\nmost complex version, instead we would like"},"781":{"dur":7,"text":"to start with the basics where your goal is\nto really control that basic and really feel"},"789":{"dur":1,"text":"like you\u2019re at home in it."},"790":{"dur":1,"text":"Then you add other things."},"792":{"dur":1,"text":"Ryan: Right."},"793":{"dur":1,"text":"Just like you said, the feeling part of it."},"795":{"dur":7,"text":"I mean this is a great way to see where you\nare that day and let\u2019s say you just use"},"802":{"dur":5,"text":"the bear and you\u2019re working on the bear\nand you just decide to use it in your warm-up"},"808":{"dur":1,"text":"every single day from now on."},"810":{"dur":4,"text":"So when you first start off, you might not\nbe able to feel really what\u2019s going on."},"814":{"dur":2,"text":"You might feel stiff or something like that."},"816":{"dur":4,"text":"But over time, in using this every single\nday, just a little bit, just a little bit,"},"821":{"dur":3,"text":"maybe 30 seconds or something, you\u2019re going\nto start feeling things in your body and your"},"824":{"dur":4,"text":"body is going to start talking back to you\nand giving you feedback."},"829":{"dur":3,"text":"And that, that is a good thing because it\u2019s\ngoing to let you know where you are that day,"},"833":{"dur":6,"text":"and you can use that to judge everything else\nreally."},"839":{"dur":1,"text":"I think that\u2019s really cool."},"840":{"dur":3,"text":"This is something that we do over here in\nall of my classes of course and that is we"},"844":{"dur":3,"text":"always start off with these three movements,\nthe bear, monkey, frogger, no matter what,"},"847":{"dur":1,"text":"after a warm-up."},"848":{"dur":5,"text":"But \u2013 and this is the way not just for the\npeople in the class but also for me to see"},"854":{"dur":1,"text":"where those people are that day."},"856":{"dur":5,"text":"So it\u2019s an assessment for both of us,\n[Music]"},"861":{"dur":5,"text":"Ryan: Yeah, let\u2019s actually get into like\nhow can we use these movements."},"866":{"dur":2,"text":"How can we kind of train these movements?"},"868":{"dur":3,"text":"So \u2026\nAndy: Yeah, there are definitely a few approaches."},"872":{"dur":5,"text":"Obviously our friend Mike Fitch has Animal\nFlow and so in that case, the entire training"},"878":{"dur":6,"text":"session is based around some locomotor patterns,\neither sequenced or improvised or whatever."},"885":{"dur":7,"text":"So that\u2019s definitely one way to do it where\nthe entire thing is all these animal movements."},"892":{"dur":3,"text":"The other one is like you mentioned actually\nat the very beginning, judo and when I was"},"896":{"dur":5,"text":"doing martial arts as a kid too, we would\nstart out every class with laps around the"},"902":{"dur":3,"text":"entire dojo in like five or six different\nlocomotor patterns."},"905":{"dur":2,"text":"It\u2019s great for a warm-up."},"907":{"dur":2,"text":"What are some other ways?"},"909":{"dur":5,"text":"So assuming that you don\u2019t want to go full\nanimal, and you don\u2019t want to start growling"},"915":{"dur":1,"text":"when you work out like \u2026\n[Crosstalk] [0:15:16]"},"917":{"dur":6,"text":"Ryan: Well, let\u2019s actually go back and look\nat

equally."},"964":{"dur":3,"text":"So you kind of get prepped, get the blood\nflowing for that and then you finish up with"},"968":{"dur":3,"text":"the froggers which is actually very similar\nto the

you\u2019re\ngood and ready for your barbell work."},"987":{"dur":2,"text":"So that\u2019s just one example of how to do\nthat."},"990":{"dur":1,"text":"Another example would \u2013 if we\u2019re looking\nat the bear."},"992":{"dur":3,"text":"I\u2019m going to go back and let\u2019s look at\nthe body weight kind of world."},"996":{"dur":3,"text":"Let\u2019s say that we\u2019re working on the handstand."},"999":{"dur":3,"text":"Let\u2019s throw that out there, the bear."},"1002":{"dur":4,"text":"The bear can be a great movement to help you\nprep for your handstand work."},"1006":{"dur":1,"text":"Why?"},"1007":{"dur":1,"text":"Well, you\u2019re going to be working on your\nwrist."},"1008":{"dur":2,"text":"You\u2019re going to be working on pushing away\nfrom the

exercises."},"1034":{"dur":5,"text":"If you look at it just as in a workout sort\nof thing as well, you can take these movements"},"1039":{"dur":6,"text":"and put them at the end of your workout in\norder to use them as a stamina set, more of"},"1046":{"dur":1,"text":"a conditioning sort of thing."},"1047":{"dur":2,"text":"So let\u2019s say you set your clock for three\nminutes."},"1050":{"dur":2,"text":"That\u2019s a long time, right?"},"1052":{"dur":3,"text":"I mean if you\u2019re doing these movements for\nthree minutes, that\u2019s pretty heinous

within those three minutes."},"1065":{"dur":2,"text":"It\u2019s a great finisher."},"1068":{"dur":2,"text":"So maybe start off with the bear."},"1071":{"dur":2,"text":"During those three minutes, you start to get\ntired."},"1073":{"dur":1,"text":"So you shift into the monkey."},"1075":{"dur":3,"text":"Your hips are starting to get tired and so\nyou move back into the bear and then

to"},"1100":{"dur":4,"text":"allow that other part to get a little bit\nof a rest before you go back into it."},"1105":{"dur":5,"text":"So those are just two big \u2013 actually three,\nthe squat, the

Exactly."},"1145":{"dur":3,"text":"Andy: So if you\u2019re using for example froggers\nfor your squat warm-up, that\u2019s really great"},"1149":{"dur":6,"text":"because it\u2019s helping you not just sink down\ninto the squat but moving your hips in and"},"1155":{"dur":3,"text":"out of the end range of motion, right?"},"1159":{"dur":3,"text":"You\u2019re warming up around that bottom position,\nnot just in it."},"1162":{"dur":4,"text":"So that\u2019s really good but we also have advanced\nvariations on the frogger where you might"},"1167":{"dur":1,"text":"extend your legs."},"1168":{"dur":1,"text":"You might go into almost a handstand."},"1170":{"dur":3,"text":"You might do these other things, but you\u2019re\nnot going to use those as part of your

isn\u2019t the goal."},"1182":{"dur":3,"text":"Just doing the right version for that situation\nis the goal, right?"},"1185":{"dur":1,"text":"Ryan: Very good point."},"1186":{"dur":6,"text":"Andy: But if you\u2019re using these for skill\npractice, for motor control improvement and"},"1192":{"dur":3,"text":"things like that, well then complexity is\nyour friend, right?"},"1196":{"dur":6,"text":"And you want to continually increase that\nwith good form and smoothness and we haven\u2019t"},"1202":{"dur":1,"text":"really touched on this too much."},"1203":{"dur":5,"text":"But when you\u2019re doing these things, you\nwant to try to do them quietly, smoothly."},"1209":{"dur":3,"text":"You don\u2019t want any \u2013 well, depending on\nthe movement, you might not want any

increase"},"1227":{"dur":4,"text":"your level but you\u2019re not always trying\nto increase complexity, depending on the application."},"1231":{"dur":6,"text":"So that may be \u2013 as coaches \u2013 earlier\nI said as maybe a student or an athlete, I"},"1238":{"dur":2,"text":"like it because it gives you a chance to see\nwhere you\u2019re at."},"1240":{"dur":5,"text":"But as coaches, one of the things we like\nabout this is that they\u2019re so versatile"},"1246":{"dur":1,"text":"and like many exercises."},"1248":{"dur":3,"text":"But we can use the same exercise and use it\nin different ways."},"1251":{"dur":1,"text":"We can use it as an assessment."},"1253":{"dur":8,"text":"We can use it as an exercise for different\npurposes, as a warm-up, as a cool-down or"},"1261":{"dur":2,"text":"any kind of different thing."},"1263":{"dur":4,"text":"That\u2019s part of what makes these just so\nuseful and why so many people use them, I"},"1267":{"dur":1,"text":"think."},"1268":{"dur":2,"text":"Ryan: Yeah."},"1270":{"dur":2,"text":"Nailed it."},"1272":{"dur":2,"text":"[Music]\nRyan: Something else I want to just kind

a complex portion of it."},"1289":{"dur":3,"text":"Let\u2019s say you\u2019re working on getting your\nhips as high as you can when you\u2019re performing"},"1292":{"dur":2,"text":"the frogger."},"1295":{"dur":4,"text":"As you start to tire and you drop down into\n\u2013 I don\u2019t even want to say the lower levels"},"1300":{"dur":3,"text":"because it\u2019s simply just a variation of\nit, right?"},"1303":{"dur":4,"text":"Because actually we will find that some of\nthe more complex versions of these skills"},"1307":{"dur":2,"text":"might be easier for you."},"1309":{"dur":4,"text":"So then it might be a matter of motor control\nor strength or flexibility."},"1313":{"dur":1,"text":"So that\u2019s kind of a different topic."},"1315":{"dur":6,"text":"But getting back and looking at dropping down\na few notches, the cool thing is, is when"},"1322":{"dur":5,"text":"you go back and you\u2019re focusing back on\nthe basis as your form drops from the higher"},"1328":{"dur":6,"text":"levels, you\u2019re still working on that skill\non your flexibility, on your strength and"},"1334":{"dur":4,"text":"on your motor control, so that next time you\ncome back to it, there\u2019s a great chance"},"1339":{"dur":2,"text":"that you\u2019re going to be much better at that\nhigher level."},"1341":{"dur":8,"text":"Andy: Yeah, and just to completely take this\njust another step further, you can take the"},"1349":{"dur":7,"text":"same movement and you can work on it and you\ncan drop the level of motor complexity and"},"1357":{"dur":4,"text":"still be working at the same degree of strength\ndevelopment."},"1361":{"dur":1,"text":"Ryan: Yes."},"1362":{"dur":1,"text":"Yes."},"1363":{"dur":2,"text":"Andy: You still will be requiring the same\ndegree of flexibility."},"1365":{"dur":2,"text":"So strength flexibility, motor control."},"1368":{"dur":5,"text":"No matter where you\u2019re at, no matter what\nyou\u2019re trying to develop, the same movement"},"1373":{"dur":5,"text":"can work at the \u2013 it\u2019s not like here\u2019s\na variation which is a level five of all three"},"1379":{"dur":1,"text":"attributes, right?"},"1380":{"dur":4,"text":"It might be a level five, a level three, and\na level eight of strength flexibility and"},"1385":{"dur":1,"text":"motor, right?"},"1386":{"dur":2,"text":"So you can vary each of those independently\nfor a lot of these movements."},"1389":{"dur":2,"text":"Not all of them of course, but for a lot of\nthem."},"1392":{"dur":6,"text":"You can always make sure that you\u2019re \u2013 if\nyou get to the point where you can\u2019t do"},"1398":{"dur":4,"text":"something at a certain level of complexity,\nwith good form anymore, but you still feel"},"1403":{"dur":4,"text":"like you can get more out of it strength-wise,\nwell then you can drop the complexity level"},"1407":{"dur":1,"text":"and keep working on it."},"1409":{"dur":2,"text":"So I hope that was fairly clear."},"1411":{"dur":1,"text":"Ryan: Yeah, that\u2019s clear."},"1412":{"dur":4,"text":"Just to maybe clarify just a bit more, so\nwe\u2019re talking \u2013 let\u2019s look at the bear,"},"1417":{"dur":2,"text":"the A frame that we were talking about earlier."},"1419":{"dur":4,"text":"So within this, when you\u2019re in this position,\nof course you\u2019ve got the strength."},"1423":{"dur":3,"text":"Maybe in the very beginning, you can only\nkeep this position for so long before your"},"1427":{"dur":2,"text":"shoulders tire out."},"1430":{"dur":2,"text":"But maybe your hip flexors are tight."},"1432":{"dur":1,"text":"OK, that\u2019s the flexibility portion of it."},"1434":{"dur":3,"text":"Then when you put it into motion, that\u2019s\nthe motor control, right?"},"1437":{"dur":5,"text":"So dropping back down and actually keeping\nthe same position, but simply bending your"},"1443":{"dur":2,"text":"arm, that\u2019s going to take more strength."},"1446":{"dur":3,"text":"So that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re talking about\nas far as changing things up and then when"},"1450":{"dur":5,"text":"you go back after working the bent arm bear,\nbecause that\u2019s such a strength-oriented"},"1455":{"dur":4,"text":"movement, as you go back and straighten your\narms, you\u2019re still going to be able to work"},"1459":{"dur":1,"text":"on strength."},"1460":{"dur":1,"text":"But it\u2019s just going to be at a different\nlevel."},"1462":{"dur":4,"text":"So you can take your focus maybe more towards\nthe flexibility side of it or the motor control."},"1466":{"dur":4,"text":"So just a broad example and I think it\u2019s\nobvious that you and I can talk about this"},"1470":{"dur":1,"text":"for days and days."},"1472":{"dur":2,"text":"But basically it comes down to everything."},"1475":{"dur":5,"text":"You should be mimicking animals in nature\nand so it\u2019s just an excuse to go outside"},"1481":{"dur":4,"text":"and so the next time you see a bird fly off\nof a power line, I think you should climb"},"1486":{"dur":4,"text":"up and try and see if you can jump off of\nthat power line and fly yourself."},"1490":{"dur":2,"text":"So that\u2019s how we can spend more time working\non animal movements."},"1493":{"dur":1,"text":"Do you agree?"},"1494":{"dur":1,"text":"Is that OK?"},"1495":{"dur":2,"text":"I mean \u2026\nAndy: That\u2019s realistic fallacy, but

talk about a lot."},"1506":{"dur":6,"text":"But it\u2019s very useful and so if you want\nto practice these things, just start practicing"},"1512":{"dur":3,"text":"and explore and you will probably find a lot\nof things."},"1515":{"dur":6,"text":"We also are around to try to teach more different\nways to use these effectively."},"1522":{"dur":3,"text":"So definitely play with

again."},"1531":{"dur":4,"text":"Look around YouTube for some videos and get\nsome inspiration and then try things and start"},"1535":{"dur":3,"text":"seeing if there are different ways you could\nuse them from how you tried to use them before."},"1539":{"dur":1,"text":"Ryan: Yeah."},"1540":{"dur":1,"text":"Andy: They\u2019re pretty valuable."},"1542":{"dur":1,"text":"Ryan: Yeah, sounds
