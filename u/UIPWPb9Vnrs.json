Occasionally, you need to sit down and"},"73":{"dur":4,"text":"re-evaluate and decide, \ufffdAre you heading\nin the direction you want to be in?\ufffd First"},"77":{"dur":3,"text":"of all, when you look around you in life,\nyou realize that there are so many choices"},"80":{"dur":5,"text":"to make and so many people that influence\nthese decisions. For example, teachers, family,"},"86":{"dur":4,"text":"friends, co-workers, and people you're in\na relationship with. They have all so much"},"90":{"dur":4,"text":"influence.

So I guess what that means is we need\nto sit down and establish some goals. So I"},"115":{"dur":5,"text":"looked up the definition of goal in the Webster's\nDictionary, like they still exist and anyone"},"120":{"dur":5,"text":"uses a dictionary, but the definition was,\n\ufffdGoal. A noun. The end towards which effort"},"126":{"dur":3,"text":"is directed.\ufffd That means you take all these\nenergy, all this effort, you direct it towards"},"130":{"dur":4,"text":"an end.

But it says we need\nto establish both short term and long term"},"139":{"dur":5,"text":"goals. Now, long term goals, those help to\nestablish the direction that we're heading"},"144":{"dur":3,"text":"in. So, for example, when I graduated college,\nI started working at Deloitte & Touche, one"},"148":{"dur":4,"text":"of the big four and I said, \ufffdYou know, my\ngoal is to be a partner at this big four accounting"},"153":{"dur":4,"text":"firm.\ufffd So, that was my long term goal. The\nshort term goals, those are the baby steps."},"158":{"dur":3,"text":"Those are the stepping stones to accomplishing\nyour long term goals. There was a movie years"},"161":{"dur":5,"text":"ago called What About Bob and it was with\nBill Murray and Richard Dreyfuss. And Bill"},"167":{"dur":3,"text":"Murray was a little crazy, having trouble\ndealing with day-to-day life, so he went to"},"171":{"dur":4,"text":"the psychiatrist and Richard Dreyfuss basically\nsaid, \ufffdYou know life\ufffds overwhelming, break"},"176":{"dur":3,"text":"it down into baby steps.\ufffd So he would take\na baby step through life, baby step through"},"180":{"dur":4,"text":"this and so on, and that's how we took his\noverwhelming thing called life and made it"},"184":{"dur":4,"text":"manageable. That's what your short term goals\nare. Those are baby steps to accomplishing"},"189":{"dur":4,"text":"your long term. So for me, my goal was to\nbecome a partner at an accounting firm, whether"},"193":{"dur":4,"text":"it\ufffds a partner a law firm, whatever it is,\nyou say, \ufffdOkay, how do I get there? First,"},"197":{"dur":3,"text":"I\ufffdve got to get into college, then I\ufffdve\ngot to get into the right major, then I have"},"201":{"dur":3,"text":"to get in the right classes, then I have to\nget involved in things like the Accounting"},"205":{"dur":4,"text":"Association, Beta Alpha Psi, whatever clubs\nrelate to that topic.

Now\nit's important to realize, don't fall into"},"227":{"dur":4,"text":"the trap into thinking that you only need\nto set goals in one area. One of my friends"},"232":{"dur":3,"text":"did that. He set career goals. He was \ufffdI\ufffdm\ngoing to have a great career,\ufffd and he did,"},"235":{"dur":4,"text":"right?

So all the"},"245":{"dur":4,"text":"sudden you\ufffdre like, \ufffdWell, part of my\nlife is great, other parts are falling apart.\ufffd"},"249":{"dur":4,"text":"So, it's important to realize that you need\nto have a well-balanced life. You need to"},"254":{"dur":4,"text":"set both personal and professional goals.\nYou need to set them in that area in order"},"258":{"dur":3,"text":"to have a good balanced life. Now, we view\ngoals as a pyramid. When I get to the top"},"262":{"dur":3,"text":"of the pyramid, woo-hoo! I\ufffdll be successful.\nMy goal is to make a hundred thousand a year."},"266":{"dur":4,"text":"I make a hundred thousand a year. I made it.\nBut, guess what? Life is shallow if you don't"},"270":{"dur":4,"text":"set goals in a variety of areas. So I've set\na whole bunch of different areas as far as"},"275":{"dur":6,"text":"goal setting, and what I said is, you got\ncareer versus job. Financial goals, physical"},"282":{"dur":5,"text":"goals, mental, family and spiritual. So, these\nare areas of goal setting that you really"},"287":{"dur":4,"text":"want to kind of look at in order to have what\nI consider to be a well-balanced life, both"},"291":{"dur":4,"text":"personally and professionally as well. So,\nwhen we look at goals, the first one here"},"296":{"dur":4,"text":"talks about career versus job. And what is\ncareer versus job? Career is what you're going"},"300":{"dur":6,"text":"be doing for 40, 50, 60 hours a week. A job,\nthat's something you did while you were in"},"306":{"dur":4,"text":"school to get you to this point. So I had\na job, I was working part time this, that"},"310":{"dur":3,"text":"and the other. That was a job, this is a career.\nThis is something that it\ufffds important you're"},"314":{"dur":4,"text":"passionate about because you're going to spend\na lot of hours doing this. For example, in"},"319":{"dur":5,"text":"my area of accounting, whether it's public\naccounting or private accounting or governmental"},"324":{"dur":3,"text":"accounting, you need to be passionate about\nwhat it is you're doing. You need to feel"},"327":{"dur":4,"text":"challenged at work. You need to feel like\nyou're working toward something. Otherwise"},"332":{"dur":4,"text":"if you\ufffdre just working for a paycheck, they\ncan't possibly pay you enough to keep you"},"336":{"dur":4,"text":"happy.

But I realized, for me,"},"340":{"dur":3,"text":"that I could keep working, I can make partner,\nand I can make a million dollars a year, and"},"344":{"dur":3,"text":"guess what? The more I would work, the more\nfrustrated I\ufffdd be, the more toys...I\ufffdve"},"347":{"dur":4,"text":"seen this in life. People make more money,\nthey buy an extra house, a nicer car, a nicer"},"351":{"dur":4,"text":"this, that and the other, and all the sudden\nhe gets this trap, this rat trap. We've got"},"356":{"dur":4,"text":"to work harder in order to make money to cover\nthese expenses which are the bills for the"},"360":{"dur":5,"text":"stuff you bought to compensate for the lack\nof happiness and feeling complete. So, therefore,"},"366":{"dur":4,"text":"with career, really look at it and think about\nhow you want to spend your working life. Think"},"370":{"dur":4,"text":"about what makes you passionate, what makes\nyou fulfilled. I remember, I had this girlfriend,"},"375":{"dur":4,"text":"and every Sunday she would get depressed.\nShe's like, \ufffdOh my gosh. Saturday was great,"},"379":{"dur":3,"text":"Friday night we partied.\ufffd Guess what? It's\nSunday. Okay, I\ufffdve got to psychologically"},"383":{"dur":4,"text":"get ready for the week. Right? It was depressing.\nIt was like Sunday was wasted. Why? Because"},"388":{"dur":4,"text":"she hated her job, so she had five days of\nblah, working for the weekends, right? They"},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"have all these songs out that like that. She\nhated it. She was miserable. Guess what? That's"},"396":{"dur":4,"text":"why she's an ex. But the point is, she was\ntrying to figure out what it is I need to"},"400":{"dur":3,"text":"do, but she wasn't passionate about what she\nneeded to do, so that's what we're talking"},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"about. So that's why, with career, you'll\nnotice, as the slide shows you, the more you"},"408":{"dur":3,"text":"work, the more you kind of grow into your\nchair. Right? Ticking and tying and footing"},"411":{"dur":6,"text":"and cross footing, but, again, realize its\ncareer versus job. As far as financial, ka-ching,"},"417":{"dur":3,"text":"right? How much money do you need? Right?\nI need to be to be on Lifestyles of the Rich"},"421":{"dur":7,"text":"and Famous, or the Trump or TMZ, I want them\nfollowing...that rich. For some of us in college,"},"428":{"dur":3,"text":"it's getting up in the morning and having\na car that starts. Woo-hoo! My car started."},"432":{"dur":4,"text":"Vrooom! I\ufffdm going make it to class today.\nSo it's all relative. So with money think"},"436":{"dur":5,"text":"about how much is enough. One of the things\nwith money...money shouldn't be a goal. Money"},"441":{"dur":4,"text":"should be a byproduct. What does that mean?\nGenerally speaking, if you're good at what"},"446":{"dur":4,"text":"you do, the money will follow, but if you\ndo something strictly for the money, they"},"451":{"dur":5,"text":"can\ufffdt possibly pay you enough to keep you\nsatisfied with what it is you're doing. So"},"456":{"dur":3,"text":"that's why, again, it's important to say if\nyour money is really important, let me pick"},"459":{"dur":4,"text":"a career path that does pay down the road\nbut let me make sure that if I don't enjoy"},"464":{"dur":4,"text":"my job and I\ufffdm only doing it for the money...they\ncan't possibly pay you enough. So keep that"},"468":{"dur":5,"text":"in mind. Physical goals, right? As you can\nsee, I used to be in great physical condition."},"474":{"dur":3,"text":"Physical condition...what that says is, okay,\nwhat kind of physical condition do I want"},"478":{"dur":4,"text":"to be in? With myself, you know, I'm traveling\na lot, as I said, I\ufffdm in five different"},"482":{"dur":3,"text":"countries, I\ufffdm all over the world, I'm all\nover the country, I\ufffdm giving presentations,"},"486":{"dur":3,"text":"speeches and so on. So, I'm out there, and\nI\ufffdm giving it all my energy, and I get home"},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"and I\ufffdm kind of buzzing\ufffd later, right?\nSo all the sudden I\ufffdm sitting there trying"},"492":{"dur":5,"text":"to relax my brain. So at 2, 3 in the morning,\nI'm flipping channels on TV. What's on TV?"},"498":{"dur":4,"text":"Infomercials. So, I said, okay, I want to\nget good physical condition. I don't have"},"502":{"dur":4,"text":"time to go to the gym all the time, so what\ndo you think I bought? Alright, and I've had"},"506":{"dur":4,"text":"people go,\ufffdUh, spray on hair,\ufffd and I\ufffdm\nlike, \ufffdThanks a lot.\ufffd Or the George Foreman"},"510":{"dur":3,"text":"grill. What I bought was this juicer, right?\nI don\ufffdt remember who was selling...Jack"},"514":{"dur":3,"text":"LaLanne or something. I think he lived to\nbe like 180-years-old. But I bought a juicer"},"518":{"dur":3,"text":"because I said, you know what? I don\ufffdt have\ntime to eat well. I come home late, I eat"},"522":{"dur":3,"text":"a microwave dinner. So let's get a juicer.\nSo I bought the carrots, and I bought the"},"525":{"dur":5,"text":"apples and I ground...and I made juice. Mmmm...Delicious,\nright? You ever try to clean one of those?"},"531":{"dur":4,"text":"Pffft...Right? Thanks a lot. I don't think\nso! So anyway, at least it was a good plan,"},"536":{"dur":4,"text":"but I realized, alright, but the point is,\nyou need to make it a priority. If you're"},"540":{"dur":4,"text":"just working and you're trying to make money\nbut you're not taking care of yourself physically,"},"544":{"dur":4,"text":"you\ufffdre out of balance. So you need to work\nthat in whether it's getting up early, half"},"548":{"dur":3,"text":"hour early, going for a walk, whether it\ufffds\ngetting a life cycle at home, whether it\ufffds"},"552":{"dur":5,"text":"joining a gym. So many people join a gym,\nand they never go. Okay, it defeats the purpose."},"558":{"dur":3,"text":"Spend the money on a bicycle! I\ufffdve seen\na commercial lately about some lady, and she's"},"561":{"dur":4,"text":"trying to figure out her exercise program.\nShe tries everything, pole dancing and jogging"},"565":{"dur":4,"text":"and biking and this and that...and, it's like,\nfind whatever it is, but blend it in your"},"570":{"dur":5,"text":"life.

What is going to be interesting for you?"},"580":{"dur":4,"text":"So, for example, what's going to help you\nalso accomplish your professional goals? I"},"585":{"dur":4,"text":"travel a lot, so I might do foreign languages.\nBon jour! Como se va. Si! Por supuesto muy"},"589":{"dur":3,"text":"importante. Ja! Ich bin.das machen! So, I\nmight study languages. Or I might listen to"},"593":{"dur":4,"text":"books on tape. Or, for example, I\ufffdll listen\nto some radio therapy. Alright, because I"},"597":{"dur":4,"text":"could, we could all use that. The point is,\nwhile your downtime, figure out what it is"},"602":{"dur":2,"text":"you want to do? For me, now, I'm traveling\nall the time, you got your phone with you"},"605":{"dur":4,"text":"and other nice things. I can log on, I can\nstart reading the newspaper when I'm traveling."},"609":{"dur":5,"text":"So areas where, again, mental. Family...with\nfamily you can see here what a lovely family"},"615":{"dur":5,"text":"I have, right? Right? Beautiful. We all the\nsame hairdos. With family, think about do"},"621":{"dur":4,"text":"you want a family? Right? In other words,\nyou\ufffdre working so hard, all the sudden people's"},"625":{"dur":6,"text":"lives go by.

Mmm"},"645":{"dur":4,"text":"hmm...get you the number. But he's a doctor.\nHe works so many hours, didn't have as much"},"650":{"dur":4,"text":"time to spend with his kid, for example. Now,\nhe's slowed down a little bit. And actually"},"654":{"dur":4,"text":"a recent study that I saw was interesting.\nThey interviewed a lot of doctors, and they"},"658":{"dur":4,"text":"found that a lot a doctors were taking more\ntime off and working fewer hours.

And I\ufffdll talk about this later, but\nlook ahead. Forecast, project and say, \ufffdWhat"},"689":{"dur":5,"text":"does the end look like? Here I am today. What\ndo I want to accomplish between now and then?\ufffd"},"694":{"dur":4,"text":"because time, it just keeps ticking by.

So, you\ufffdre time, you\ufffdre working,\nthat brings in money, but that money doesn't"},"707":{"dur":4,"text":"buy more time on the end of your life. That\ufffds\nwhy you have to have that balance. So think"},"712":{"dur":5,"text":"about that. For me, family. I said, twenties,\nthirties I don\ufffdt want a family. I'm going"},"717":{"dur":3,"text":"work hard. I\ufffdm going to get a good career\nfoundation. I\ufffdm going to travel the world."},"721":{"dur":4,"text":"I used to take a backpack and I would go as,\nlike a courier, where I would get, like, a"},"725":{"dur":3,"text":"200 dollar flight in and out of a country\nlike Thailand, and I would have two to four"},"728":{"dur":3,"text":"weeks to just travel.

It might"},"744":{"dur":3,"text":"be time to check out.\ufffd So that's when I\nmade it a goal. I said, \ufffdI want to settle"},"748":{"dur":4,"text":"down. I went, found someone with what I thought\nwould be a good, similar religious background,"},"752":{"dur":5,"text":"settled down, and had my 2.75 kids, and so\non.

So, again,"},"772":{"dur":5,"text":"I had to suddenly make it a goal to at some\npoint focus in on. My goal was to have a family."},"777":{"dur":4,"text":"Let me make that a priority. Let me focus\nin and do that. Finally, spirituality. Woo-ooo,"},"782":{"dur":6,"text":"right? Spirituality. What is spirituality?\nThat says, what makes you feel complete.

Now what"},"823":{"dur":6,"text":"does addressing all these goals mean? It means\naddressing all these goals in career, family,"},"829":{"dur":6,"text":"physical, mental, spiritual because all of\nthose are areas that you want to grow in."},"836":{"dur":3,"text":"So, in order to have a good, what we call\nbalanced life, it's important to address all"},"840":{"dur":5,"text":"those areas.
