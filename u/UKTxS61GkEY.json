So I'm gonna just open\nup with a few questions, some of which I know"},"97":{"dur":5,"text":"some of the answers to. But I'll start with\nAlan. I joined the company just over six years"},"103":{"dur":4,"text":"ago. It was a much smaller company then. Alan\njoined the company far before then, so he"},"107":{"dur":6,"text":"has seen fairly enormous growth here.

But there's also other things. Small\nproperties. You know, things like speech recognition"},"186":{"dur":5,"text":"and translation have been huge, and I think\nare gonna make a worldwide impact.

No, I really--"},"197":{"dur":2,"text":">> GIROUARD: Save the best for last.\n>> EUSTACE: No, I really feel like right now"},"199":{"dur":7,"text":"we're at a stage, now, where I think we can\nlower the barrier of entry to corporations"},"206":{"dur":6,"text":"and stuff. We can change the economics. We\ncan apply a lot of the research and development"},"212":{"dur":6,"text":"efforts that we've had on a much larger scale.\nAnd I think we can change the economics of"},"219":{"dur":1,"text":"the industry.

Maybe I'll\njust do one question of each, and then we'll"},"223":{"dur":6,"text":"go to the audience. Vint's obviously been\ninvolved in the development of the Internet"},"229":{"dur":4,"text":"for a long time and has done a lot of work\nwith the U.S. Government over the years. One"},"233":{"dur":3,"text":"of the notions that this group here hears\nabout a lot, and I'm just interested in your"},"237":{"dur":4,"text":"perspective, is the notion of a private cloud.\nWhat's the public cloud, what's the private"},"242":{"dur":3,"text":"cloud? Is this a semantic debate, or is there\nsome substance to it?"},"246":{"dur":5,"text":">> CERF: Well, first of all, I have to tell\nyou that coming on after that performance"},"251":{"dur":6,"text":"from The Onion is tough. I think it is not\na semantic difference. Private clouds are"},"258":{"dur":4,"text":"just as reasonable as private Internets. Networks\nthat use the technology of Internet, but don't"},"262":{"dur":4,"text":"go outside and interconnect with the rest\nof the world. So companies that make clouds"},"267":{"dur":7,"text":"for other companies--I think of IBM, for example--are\nmaking things that are tools for those companies"},"274":{"dur":5,"text":"to use. The clouds that we make here are tools\nfor people to use. They're much more broadly"},"280":{"dur":4,"text":"accessible because of the fact that they're\nreachable through the public Internet. So"},"284":{"dur":4,"text":"I don't see those as in conflict with each\nother. In fact, one of the things that you"},"289":{"dur":3,"text":"didn't ask, but I'm going to answer anyway,\nlike every good graduate student does--you"},"293":{"dur":6,"text":"adapt the question until you can answer it--is\nthat inter-cloud interaction is something"},"300":{"dur":6,"text":"that is still very much in a formative stage.\nIf anyone is thinking about \"How do I get"},"306":{"dur":5,"text":"my data out after I put it in? How do I move\nit from one cloud to another?\" There is no"},"312":{"dur":7,"text":"vocabulary right now for cloud A to say, \"Please\nmove this data to cloud B.\" It's like we were"},"320":{"dur":5,"text":"in 1973 with the Internet. There were networks--\nthey were proprietary. The S&A network didn't"},"326":{"dur":5,"text":"interact in any convenient way with DECnet\nor with Hewlett-Packard's network. The Internet"},"331":{"dur":4,"text":"came along and said, \"We can make a non-proprietary\nway of allowing all these nets to interact.\""},"336":{"dur":6,"text":"I think we're at the same point in 2010 where\nwe were in 1973 when it comes to intercloud"},"342":{"dur":4,"text":"interactions. Just to add one more point,\nimagine that you have data in cloud A, and"},"347":{"dur":4,"text":"it's protected. It's access-controlled. You've\ngone to a lot of trouble to do that. The question"},"351":{"dur":3,"text":"then is, if I do want to move the data to\ncloud B, how do I move the metadata along"},"355":{"dur":7,"text":"with it so that it's correctly understood\nand interpreted as equivalent access control?"},"362":{"dur":4,"text":"So there are a number of different organizations\npursuing questions about intercloud interaction."},"367":{"dur":4,"text":"It's a very rich area for exploration, and\nI don't think there are a whole lot of solid"},"372":{"dur":3,"text":"answers yet.\n>> GIROUARD: Great. Thanks, Vint. A question"},"376":{"dur":4,"text":"for Jeff. And just by way of context, Jeff\nhas been responsible for quite some time for"},"380":{"dur":4,"text":"the engineering work around Google apps as\nwell as Google's ad systems and numerous other"},"385":{"dur":4,"text":"types of systems within Google. But I want\nto ask Jeff--I mean, Google's known for, you"},"389":{"dur":5,"text":"know, launch quickly, iterate often, that\ntype of approach towards making innovation"},"395":{"dur":4,"text":"happen and happen very quickly. What does\nGoogle have to do to reconcile that with the"},"400":{"dur":4,"text":"needs of a large enterprise, which obviously\nneeds something that's more predictable, where"},"405":{"dur":2,"text":"it has more of a tried and true--a more diverse\nuser base, perhaps, that"},"408":{"dur":8,"text":">> HUBER: Sure. So we've done our best to\ncombine the best of both. We do have the foundation"},"416":{"dur":5,"text":"of starting with very large-scale consumer\nservices, where we've already made the capital"},"421":{"dur":5,"text":"investment. We have a great user experience.\nThere's consumer understanding of what those"},"426":{"dur":3,"text":"products are, how they work. There's a lot\nof pull in the organization. You heard that"},"430":{"dur":6,"text":"some in the CIO panel, where a lot of the\nusers already are enthusiasts. Active users"},"436":{"dur":4,"text":"already know how to use these products. So\nboth the adoption and training and a lot of"},"441":{"dur":5,"text":"the things are much less of an issue. That\nsaid, there are very notable differences between"},"446":{"dur":5,"text":"the two use cases. So we've done a lot of\nwork on just prioritizing the feature work"},"451":{"dur":4,"text":"of what are the kind of capabilities you need\nin the Enterprise. You know, some of just"},"456":{"dur":5,"text":"the very tactical things, like delegation\nof accounts and a calendar being able to support"},"461":{"dur":5,"text":"resources, things like that. That said, when\nwe get into those requirements, we often see"},"467":{"dur":5,"text":"that those are very common with enthusiasts\nor power-user consumer cases. So we do think"},"472":{"dur":6,"text":"that the model of having a single platform\ndriving that continues to make a lot of sense."},"478":{"dur":4,"text":"We've accelerated some of our investments\naround reliability and security, which are"},"483":{"dur":5,"text":"topics that very near and dear to the Enterprise\nheart. But again, we see parallels of that"},"489":{"dur":4,"text":"into the consumer world, where the kind of\nthings that we've done around Gmail with default"},"493":{"dur":8,"text":"https for wireless users has been a big boon\nof having log-in history information and location"},"502":{"dur":4,"text":"available and accessible. They are important\nfor the Enterprise, but important for consumer"},"506":{"dur":6,"text":"users as well. And then another area for the\nEnterprise that's been particularly important"},"513":{"dur":5,"text":"is being able to support--scalably support\nan organization. So building out the APIs"},"519":{"dur":5,"text":"that you need to be able to transition and\nmanage. You have very large user bases. Having"},"524":{"dur":5,"text":"the ability to provision 20,000 accounts or\n30,000 accounts when you're doing the weekend"},"529":{"dur":6,"text":"migration from one place to another. And then\nall of the inner operation that you need,"},"536":{"dur":3,"text":"with the existing infrastructure that you\nhave--being able to sync to different devices,"},"539":{"dur":5,"text":"being able to migrate from one platform to\nanother are some of the incremental things"},"545":{"dur":7,"text":"that we've had to prioritize. But that foundation\nof having products that scale, that have a"},"552":{"dur":4,"text":"user experience where there's consumer understanding\nand consumer demand, we continue to be very"},"557":{"dur":2,"text":"excited about it.\n>> GIROUARD: All righty. Thanks, Jeff. Let's"},"559":{"dur":4,"text":"go to the first question from the audience.\n>> ROSS: Hi, gentlemen, this is Doug Ross,"},"564":{"dur":6,"text":"Western & Southern Financial Group. A question\nreally for all of you. We've seen some changes"},"570":{"dur":5,"text":"with respect to network neutrality with some\ndecisions over the last couple of weeks. And,"},"576":{"dur":5,"text":"Dr. Cerf, I know you've been heavily involved\nwith network neutrality. I'm interested in"},"581":{"dur":6,"text":"what's your take on the FCC and network neutrality\nin general and your relationships with the"},"588":{"dur":4,"text":"various carriers. Thank you.\n>> CERF: So first of all--let me take the"},"593":{"dur":5,"text":"last part first. In a sense, we are very dependent\non carriers all around the world, because"},"598":{"dur":6,"text":"that's how users get to our products and services.\nSo maintaining a working relationship with"},"605":{"dur":5,"text":"them is important to us. With regard to net\nneutrality, the term itself has been vastly"},"611":{"dur":7,"text":"distorted by the various debates and the biases\nthat people have regarding oversight of network"},"618":{"dur":5,"text":"operation. The point that I'd like to emphasize\nis that our concern has been couched in terms"},"624":{"dur":6,"text":"of anti-competitive behavior. The possibility\nthat an entity that controls broadband access"},"630":{"dur":7,"text":"to the Internet in general might also interfere,\nin some fashion, with the choice of users"},"637":{"dur":5,"text":"to get access to any service and any product\nand any application anywhere on the Internet"},"642":{"dur":4,"text":"in the interests of the company that's controlling\nthat broadband access. And so our biggest"},"647":{"dur":4,"text":"concern is not that all packets are treated\nidentically. We know that doesn't make sense."},"651":{"dur":4,"text":"It's not that you shouldn't have to pay more\nif you consume more resources--that's not"},"656":{"dur":4,"text":"net neutrality. Net neutrality has to do with\nassuring that there's a level playing field"},"661":{"dur":6,"text":"so that companies like Google, Yahoo!, and\nothers that provide services to consumers"},"667":{"dur":6,"text":"will have equal opportunity for the consumers\nto reach their products. There's a built-in,"},"673":{"dur":5,"text":"inherent potential-- what I would say conflict\nof interest. If you're in the business of"},"679":{"dur":6,"text":"delivering video for a fee, but you are also\nsupplying broadband access to the Internet,"},"685":{"dur":6,"text":"it's conceivable that you would want to limit\nthe competitors from delivering their video"},"691":{"dur":7,"text":"in an equally facilitated way. I'm not saying\nanybody's doing that, but the concern is there"},"698":{"dur":4,"text":"because there isn't a great deal of choice\nfor users to pick among the various broadband"},"702":{"dur":5,"text":"providers. With regard to the most recent\ndecision--I'm just an engineer and not an"},"708":{"dur":6,"text":"attorney, but the way I've interpreted this\nis that the court said that the Title 1 place,"},"715":{"dur":5,"text":"where Internet is now located for, let me\ncall it regulatory purposes, didn't give the"},"720":{"dur":10,"text":"FCC, in the court's view, adequate leverage\nto cite Comcast for its interference with,"},"731":{"dur":5,"text":"in particular, BitTorrent traffic. I think\nthat the side effect of that may be to drive"},"737":{"dur":8,"text":"the FCC towards relabeling Internet service\ninto, for example, Title 2, which is communications"},"745":{"dur":5,"text":"services. As an engineer, I have felt very\nstrongly that the Internet does have a layered"},"751":{"dur":5,"text":"structure. It does have a communications component.\nThat communications component should be equally"},"757":{"dur":5,"text":"accessible to everyone. And in the past, when\ncommunications and Internet services were"},"762":{"dur":8,"text":"in Title 2, the common carriage rules applied.\nAnd when you offered access to communications"},"770":{"dur":6,"text":"services, you had to do so on an equal basis\nto everyone, equal terms and conditions. So"},"777":{"dur":5,"text":"I think that a return to that should not be\naccompanied, however, with a return to all"},"783":{"dur":5,"text":"of strictures and regulatory structures of\nTitle 2. You know, the telephony-related things"},"789":{"dur":4,"text":"don't necessarily have to apply. So the trick\nfor the FCC will be to figure out whether"},"793":{"dur":7,"text":"it can make such a move and do so in a way\nthat limits the range of regulatory oversight"},"801":{"dur":5,"text":"that it chooses to exercise over a reclassified\nInternet."},"807":{"dur":6,"text":">> GIROUARD: Thanks, Vint. Next question.\n>> STANTLEY: Andrew Stantley, from MWV. Vint,"},"813":{"dur":3,"text":"specifically, and then to the whole panel.\nWhat do you see as the greatest challenge"},"816":{"dur":3,"text":"from a protocol perspective? So much of what\nyou guys do are based off of the protocols"},"820":{"dur":2,"text":"that came out in the '70s, '80s, and '90s.\n>> CERF: Yeah."},"822":{"dur":4,"text":">> STANTLEY: Where do you see your next focus\nbeing?

We're going\nto run out of the v4 address space in the"},"849":{"dur":5,"text":"middle of 2011 or sooner. There are very few\nslash-A blocks that are left. And I think"},"855":{"dur":5,"text":"that's a really important message for each\none of you who cares to make sure that your"},"860":{"dur":4,"text":"participation in an expanding Internet will\ncontinue. You need to implement v6 in parallel"},"865":{"dur":5,"text":"with v4, and you need to ask your ISPs to\ndo that. On the more general basis, I see"},"870":{"dur":5,"text":"some huge opportunities for Internet to expand\ninto wireless modes of operation--satellite-based"},"875":{"dur":6,"text":"operation, which, up till now, it has not\nexploited. When you transmit over the radio,"},"881":{"dur":4,"text":"you have the possibility of delivering the\nsame thing to multiple parties. The Internet"},"885":{"dur":4,"text":"protocols don't take advantage of that. They\ntake broadcast media and turn them into point-to-point"},"890":{"dur":4,"text":"links. And in some sense, that is a pity,\nbecause there are some very useful things"},"894":{"dur":5,"text":"you can imagine doing with a satellite raining\nInternet packets down on 100 million receivers"},"899":{"dur":3,"text":"for people who are interested in receiving\nsomething in common, like a new update of"},"903":{"dur":7,"text":"software. So I think scaling, and the ability\nto make better use of radio-based resources"},"911":{"dur":6,"text":"are major areas for development. The higher-level\napplications, though--identity, authentication...the"},"917":{"dur":4,"text":"ability to know with whom you're transacting\nis another place where I anticipate a great"},"921":{"dur":5,"text":"deal of important work.\n>> EUSTACE: We also have a big group working"},"927":{"dur":5,"text":"on HTML5. We think that's a place where the\nstandards are really gonna make a big difference,"},"932":{"dur":5,"text":"because, you know, you're all aware of Internet-delivered\napplications, and you know how important it"},"937":{"dur":5,"text":"is to make that experience as fast and as\ninteractive as you might see in other kinds"},"943":{"dur":4,"text":"of mediums, like direct applications.

You can deliver any application"},"1037":{"dur":3,"text":"that you want. You don't have to build one\nfor this client and this client and this client"},"1041":{"dur":6,"text":"and this client and this client. So there's\na big opportunity between those two.
