the language."},"409":{"dur":4,"text":"And actually, one\nencounters, I encounter,"},"413":{"dur":2,"text":"everybody encounters,\nkinds of languages"},"416":{"dur":3,"text":"that count as one's

now--"},"517":{"dur":0,"text":"have a little drink."},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"Let's just talk of some\ninstances of things, some,"},"523":{"dur":2,"text":"as it were, scenes\nof translation,"},"526":{"dur":3,"text":"from different moments, and\ndifferent cultural places,"},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"and different\nmoments in history,"},"531":{"dur":3,"text":"just to get a sense of\nthe variety of the field,"},"534":{"dur":1,"text":"as it were."},"535":{"dur":2,"text":"So the first one is\nthe school classroom."},"537":{"dur":1,"text":"And this is where I\nlearned my

here,"},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"there's a passage of a foreign\nlanguage on the whiteboard,"},"550":{"dur":1,"text":"on the blackboard,\nor on the text,"},"552":{"dur":3,"text":"and you have to

\"translation,\""},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"questions of right and\nwrong or better and worse"},"580":{"dur":2,"text":"come into the room as well."},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"So the idea of translation,\nthe idea of discipline"},"585":{"dur":1,"text":"belong together."},"587":{"dur":1,"text":"The other general\npoint I want to bring"},"589":{"dur":4,"text":"from this particular context\nis that the kind of translation"},"593":{"dur":3,"text":"that school kids or\nstudents do in order"},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"to show that they\nknow the language"},"599":{"dur":2,"text":"is a particular kind of thing."},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"So the teacher is marking it,\nand the teacher is saying,"},"605":{"dur":2,"text":"can I tell from this\ntranslation that the student"},"607":{"dur":3,"text":"has understood the text in the\noriginal language well enough?"},"611":{"dur":1,"text":"And so in that\nenvironment, you're"},"613":{"dur":2,"text":"doing something that's\ncalled translation,"},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"but what's controlling\nwhat you actually"},"617":{"dur":3,"text":"do is the need to show the\nteacher that you

this\nparticular academic exercise."},"662":{"dur":1,"text":"So the general\npoints I want to get"},"664":{"dur":4,"text":"from that are that translations\nare never just into a language,"},"668":{"dur":2,"text":"it's being done in a\nparticular context,"},"671":{"dur":3,"text":"subject to a set of\nparticular expectations"},"674":{"dur":2,"text":"for a particular

languages."},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"As I guess happens in\nthis building quite a lot,"},"696":{"dur":3,"text":"say you've got a group\nof people speaking."},"700":{"dur":1,"text":"They all know\ndifferent languages."},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"You want to communicate."},"703":{"dur":2,"text":"You want to find a shared\nmedium of communication."},"706":{"dur":2,"text":"Maybe English is\nthe

different ways."},"715":{"dur":3,"text":"And you negotiate a medium\nof understanding, don't you?"},"718":{"dur":1,"text":"So say there's an\nItalian speaker,"},"719":{"dur":2,"text":"and the Italian
