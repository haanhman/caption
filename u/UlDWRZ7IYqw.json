{"0":{"dur":7,"text":"Translator: Anna Trela\nReviewer: Denise RQ"},"33":{"dur":5,"text":"Good afternoon. As you are all aware, \nwe face difficult economic times."},"39":{"dur":4,"text":"I come to you with a modest proposal \nfor easing the financial burden."},"44":{"dur":4,"text":"This idea came to me while talking\nto a physicist friend of mine at MIT."},"48":{"dur":2,"text":"He was struggling \nto explain something to me."},"51":{"dur":4,"text":"A beautiful experiment, \nthat uses lasers to cool down matter."},"56":{"dur":2,"text":"He confused me from the very start,"},"58":{"dur":2,"text":"because light does not cool things down."},"61":{"dur":2,"text":"It makes it hotter. \nIt is happening right now."},"63":{"dur":2,"text":"The reason that you can see me \nstanding here"},"66":{"dur":4,"text":"is because this room is filled with \nmore than one hundered quintillion photons."},"70":{"dur":3,"text":"And they are moving randomly through the space,\nnear the speed of light."},"74":{"dur":1,"text":"All of them are different colours."},"75":{"dur":2,"text":"They are rippling \nwith different frequencies."},"78":{"dur":2,"text":"And they are bouncing off every surface, \nincluding me."},"80":{"dur":2,"text":"Some of those are flying \ndirectly into your eyes,"},"83":{"dur":3,"text":"and that is why your brain \nis forming an image of me standing here."},"86":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, laser is different."},"88":{"dur":1,"text":"It also uses photons,"},"89":{"dur":2,"text":"but they are all synchronized."},"92":{"dur":2,"text":"If you focus them into a beam"},"94":{"dur":2,"text":"what you have \nis an incredibly useful tool!"},"96":{"dur":2,"text":"The control of the laser is so precise,"},"99":{"dur":2,"text":"that you can peform surgery \ninside of an eye."},"101":{"dur":2,"text":"You can use it \nto store massive amounts of data,"},"104":{"dur":1,"text":"and you can use it \nfor this beautiful experiment,"},"106":{"dur":2,"text":"that my friend \nwas struggling to explain."},"108":{"dur":5,"text":"First, you trap atoms in a special bottle,\nthat uses electromagnetic fields"},"114":{"dur":3,"text":"to isolate the atoms \nfrom the noise of the environment."},"117":{"dur":3,"text":"And the atoms themselves \nare quite violent,"},"120":{"dur":1,"text":"but if you fire lasers"},"122":{"dur":2,"text":"that are precisely tuned \nto the right frequency,"},"125":{"dur":3,"text":"an atom will briefly absorb those photons\nand tend to slow down."},"128":{"dur":7,"text":"Little by little it gets colder\nuntil eventually it approaches absolute zero."},"136":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, if you use the right kind of atoms\nand you get them cold enough,"},"139":{"dur":2,"text":"something truly bizarre happens."},"142":{"dur":2,"text":"It's no longer a solid, \na liquid or a gas,"},"145":{"dur":4,"text":"it enters a new state of matter,\ncalled a superfluid."},"149":{"dur":2,"text":"The atoms lose their individual identity,"},"152":{"dur":2,"text":"and the rules from the quantum world take over."},"155":{"dur":3,"text":"And that's what gives superfluid\nsuch spooky properties."},"159":{"dur":4,"text":"For example, if you shine light\nthrough a superfluid,"},"163":{"dur":5,"text":"it is able to slow photons \ndown to 60 km\/h."},"176":{"dur":4,"text":"Another spooky property is that it flows\nwith absolutely no viscosity or friction,"},"181":{"dur":3,"text":"so if you were to take the lid of that bottle\nit won't stay inside."},"184":{"dur":5,"text":"A thin film will creep up the inside wall,\nflow over the top"},"190":{"dur":2,"text":"and right out to the outside."},"193":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, of course, at the moment \nthat it does at the outside environment"},"196":{"dur":3,"text":"and its temperature rises \nby even a fraction of a degree,"},"199":{"dur":2,"text":"it immediately turns back \ninto normal matter."},"201":{"dur":3,"text":"Superfluids are one of the most fragile things \nwe've ever discovered."},"205":{"dur":2,"text":"And this is the great pleasure of science,"},"207":{"dur":4,"text":"the defeat of our intuition \nthrough experimentation."},"211":{"dur":1,"text":"But the experiment \nis not the end of the story,"},"213":{"dur":3,"text":"because you still have to transmit \nthat knowlege to other people."},"216":{"dur":2,"text":"I have a PhD in Molecular Biology."},"218":{"dur":3,"text":"I still barely understand what most scientists \nare talking about."},"222":{"dur":3,"text":"So, as my friend was trying \nto explain that experiment,"},"225":{"dur":4,"text":"it seemed like, the more he said, \nthe less I understood."},"231":{"dur":3,"text":"Because, if you're trying to give someone \nthe big picture of a complex idea,"},"235":{"dur":6,"text":"to really capture its essence,\nthe fewer words you'd use, the better."},"242":{"dur":2,"text":"In fact the ideal may be \nto use no words at all."},"244":{"dur":1,"text":"I remember thinking"},"246":{"dur":3,"text":"\"My friend could have explained \nthat entire experiment with a dance.\""},"249":{"dur":4,"text":"Of course, there never seem to be \nany dancers around when you need them."},"254":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, the idea is not \nas crazy as it sounds."},"256":{"dur":2,"text":"I started a contest four years ago \ncalled \"Dance Your PhD\"."},"259":{"dur":6,"text":"Instead of explaining the research with words,\nscientists have to explain it with dance."},"265":{"dur":2,"text":"Suprisingly, it seems to work."},"267":{"dur":3,"text":"Dance really can make science \neasier to understand."},"270":{"dur":2,"text":"But don't take my word for it."},"273":{"dur":2,"text":"Go on the internet \nand search for \"Dance Your PhD\"."},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"There are hundreds of dancing scientists \nwaiting for you."},"277":{"dur":3,"text":"The most suprising thing that I 've learnt\nwhile running the contest,"},"281":{"dur":4,"text":"is that some scientists are now working directly \nwith dancers on their research."},"286":{"dur":3,"text":"For example, at the University of Minnesota\nthere is a biomedical engineer"},"289":{"dur":3,"text":"named David Odde, and he works with dancers \nto study how cells move."},"293":{"dur":1,"text":"They do it by changing their shape."},"295":{"dur":3,"text":"When a chemical signal \nwashes up on one side"},"299":{"dur":2,"text":"it triggers the cell to expand \nits shape on that side,"},"301":{"dur":3,"text":"because the cell is constantly touching \nand tugging at the environment."},"305":{"dur":3,"text":"So, that allows cells to ooze along\nin the right directions."},"309":{"dur":6,"text":"But what seems so slow and graceful \nfrom the outside is really more like chaos inside."},"315":{"dur":4,"text":"Because cells control their shape \nwith a skeleton of rigid protein fibres."},"319":{"dur":3,"text":"And those fibres are constantly falling apart."},"323":{"dur":4,"text":"But just as quickly as they explode, more proteins\nattach to their ends and grow them longer."},"327":{"dur":5,"text":"So it's constanlty changing, \njust to remain exactly the same."},"333":{"dur":3,"text":"David builds mathematical models of this, \nand then he tests those in a lab,"},"336":{"dur":3,"text":"but before he does that, \nhe works with dancers to figure out"},"340":{"dur":2,"text":"what kinds of models \nto build in the first place."},"342":{"dur":2,"text":"It is basically efficient brainstorming."},"345":{"dur":3,"text":"And when I visited David \nto learn about his research,"},"348":{"dur":6,"text":"he used dancers to explain it to me\nrather than the usual method, PowerPoint."},"355":{"dur":2,"text":"And this brings me to my modest proposal."},"358":{"dur":5,"text":"I think that bad PowerPoint presentations\nare a serious threat to the global economy."},"363":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"365":{"dur":2,"text":"(Applause)"},"373":{"dur":3,"text":"It does depend on how \nyou measure it, of course,"},"377":{"dur":4,"text":"but one estimate has put the drain \nat 250 million dollars per day."},"381":{"dur":3,"text":"Now that assumes half hour presentation\nfor an average audience of four people"},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"with salaries of 35.000 dollars."},"387":{"dur":5,"text":"And it conservatively assumes that about a quarter \nof the presentations are complete waste of time."},"393":{"dur":4,"text":"And given that, there are some, apparently,\n30 million PowerPoint presentations"},"398":{"dur":6,"text":"created every day, that would indeed add up \nto an annual waste of a hundred billion dollars."},"404":{"dur":6,"text":"Of course that's just the time \nwe're losing sitting through presentations."},"411":{"dur":1,"text":"There are other costs."},"412":{"dur":5,"text":"Because PowerPoint is a tool,\nand like any tool, it can and will be abused."},"418":{"dur":2,"text":"To borrow a concept \nfrom my country's CIA,"},"420":{"dur":3,"text":"it helps you to soften up your audience,"},"423":{"dur":3,"text":"it distracts them with pretty pictures,\nirrelevant data."},"427":{"dur":3,"text":"It allows you to create\nthe illusion of competence,"},"431":{"dur":4,"text":"the illusion of simplicity,\nand most destructively,"},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"the illusion of understanding."},"440":{"dur":3,"text":"So now my country \nis 15 trillion dollars in debt."},"443":{"dur":4,"text":"Our leaders are working tirelessly \nto try and find ways to save money."},"448":{"dur":4,"text":"One idea is to drastically reduce \npublic support for the Arts."},"452":{"dur":4,"text":"For example, our National Endowment for the Arts,\nwith its 150 million dollar budget."},"457":{"dur":6,"text":"Slashing that programme would immediately reduce\nthe national debt by about 0.011%."},"463":{"dur":2,"text":"One certainly cannot argue with those numbers."},"466":{"dur":6,"text":"However, once we eliminate public funding \nfor the Arts, there will be some drawbacks."},"473":{"dur":4,"text":"The artists on the street \nwill swell the ranks of the unemployed."},"477":{"dur":2,"text":"Many will turn \nto drug abuse and prostitution,"},"480":{"dur":3,"text":"and that will inevitably lower \npropery values in urban neighbourhoods."},"484":{"dur":4,"text":"All of this could wipe out the savings \nwe are hoping to make in the first place."},"488":{"dur":3,"text":"I shall now therefore \nhumbly propose my own thoughts,"},"491":{"dur":3,"text":"which I hope will not be liable \nto the least objection."},"495":{"dur":3,"text":"Once we eliminate public funding for the artists,\nlet's put them back to work,"},"498":{"dur":2,"text":"by using them instead of PowerPoint."},"501":{"dur":3,"text":"As a test case, I propose \nwe start with American dancers."},"505":{"dur":3,"text":"After all, they are\nthe most perishable of their kind,"},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"prone to injury and very slow to heal \ndue to our health care system."},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"(Laughter)"},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"Rather than dancing our PhDs,"},"515":{"dur":3,"text":"we should use dance \nto explain all of our complex problems."},"519":{"dur":6,"text":"Imagine our politicians using dance to explain \nwhy we must invade a foreign country,"},"526":{"dur":2,"text":"or bail out an investment bank."},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"It'd sure help."},"531":{"dur":5,"text":"Of course some day, in the deep future,\na technology of persuasion,"},"536":{"dur":3,"text":"even more powerful than PowerPoint \nmay be invented,"},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"rendering dancers \nunnecessary as tools of rhetoric."},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"However, I trust that by that day,"},"546":{"dur":3,"text":"we shall have passed \nthis present financial calamity."},"549":{"dur":6,"text":"Perhaps by then, we will be able to afford \nthe luxury of just sitting in an audience,"},"556":{"dur":6,"text":"with no other purpose than to witness \nthe human form in motion."},"562":{"dur":2,"text":"(Music)"},"635":{"dur":4,"text":"(Applause)"}}
