relations--"},"463":{"dur":1,"text":"a lot of journalists do that."},"464":{"dur":2,"text":"And at the time that\nI was looking at this,"},"467":{"dur":1,"text":"there was this big\ntrend that's still"},"468":{"dur":2,"text":"kind of going on-- it's\nkind of played out though--"},"470":{"dur":2,"text":"where companies were\nhiring journalists to build"},"472":{"dur":1,"text":"their in-house

one."},"479":{"dur":2,"text":"And I thought, oh, I could get\nin on this corporate journalism"},"481":{"dur":3,"text":"thing and maybe start a\nnew career out of that."},"484":{"dur":2,"text":"And that should have\na 10 or 15 year run."},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"As it turns out, I don't\nthink it's really working out."},"489":{"dur":2,"text":"A lot of journalists who have\ngone for like-- and VC

and\nyou talk to them."},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"But you never\nreally find out what"},"561":{"dur":1,"text":"it's like behind the curtain."},"563":{"dur":2,"text":"Because it's all\nstage managed and PR."},"565":{"dur":2,"text":"But I thought it always\nlooked like so much fun."},"568":{"dur":3,"text":"I had friends who went\nto Microsoft early on,"},"571":{"dur":1,"text":"had a really good

I happened to get\nlucky and found a place"},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"So I thought OK, that's\na good, easy step."},"598":{"dur":2,"text":"And it's a younger,\nsmaller
