get together."},"286":{"dur":1,"text":"Let's host, interact--"},"287":{"dur":0,"text":"BRENDON EDWARDS: Yeah."},"288":{"dur":1,"text":"JASON ANDREAS:\n--conversate around food."},"290":{"dur":1,"text":"And food is, kind of,\nwhat brings us together."},"292":{"dur":2,"text":"But that's not the key\naspect of it, necessarily."},"295":{"dur":2,"text":"So it sounds very similar to\nthe philosophy we take here."},"298":{"dur":0,"text":"BRENDON EDWARDS: Yeah."},"299":{"dur":1,"text":"And I think that's\nwhat's, kind of, drawn me."},"304":{"dur":2,"text":"I wanted to tell you a\nlittle bit about my times"},"306":{"dur":1,"text":"and some of the fun\nexperiences I've"},"308":{"dur":1,"text":"had being a host and a guest."},"312":{"dur":2,"text":"As I said, I went to Mexico."},"314":{"dur":1,"text":"I was going to actually\ngo to the Culinary"},"316":{"dur":1,"text":"Institute of America\nin New York, which"},"318":{"dur":3,"text":"is one of the finest\nculinary schools in the US."},"321":{"dur":6,"text":"And I went out and visited\nthere in August of 2001."},"328":{"dur":3,"text":"Got to see the World Trade\nCenters right before 9\/11,"},"331":{"dur":1,"text":"which was really interesting."},"333":{"dur":3,"text":"Immediately after accepting or\ngetting my acceptance letter,"},"336":{"dur":3,"text":"I bought a plane ticket\nto live in Mexico."},"339":{"dur":4,"text":"So I've always been\nthat person that always"},"343":{"dur":3,"text":"did my own thing, despite\nmy dad didn't really"},"346":{"dur":3,"text":"think that was a great idea."},"350":{"dur":4,"text":"And that's where it continued."},"354":{"dur":3,"text":"I thought that maybe this\nwas a sign this was something"},"358":{"dur":1,"text":"that I shouldn't be doing?"},"359":{"dur":2,"text":"I need to go find my own path."},"362":{"dur":2,"text":"So I went down there and\nfound a nonprofit agency."},"365":{"dur":1,"text":"I ending up working\nat a Montessori school"},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"with preschool kids."},"368":{"dur":2,"text":"It is great."},"370":{"dur":1,"text":"It probably helped\nme with my patience."},"372":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm not a normal\nchef in the kitchen"},"374":{"dur":3,"text":"anymore the way you might\nsee it on TV with Gordon"},"377":{"dur":1,"text":"Ramsay and all that jazz."},"381":{"dur":3,"text":"A lot of my cooks have seen\nme as more of a zen person."},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"Like, they don't see me\nlose me temper very often,"},"387":{"dur":1,"text":"not to say that I\nhaven't possibly"},"389":{"dur":1,"text":"thrown some things in my life."},"393":{"dur":4,"text":"But it helped, and it was an\ninteresting part of my path."},"397":{"dur":1,"text":"The culture there\nthough was interesting"},"399":{"dur":2,"text":"because I started to\nactually observe cultures"},"401":{"dur":2,"text":"and how I was received\nas a host, how"},"404":{"dur":4,"text":"I was acting as a guest."},"408":{"dur":2,"text":"I got to travel a little\nbit and actually got"},"411":{"dur":2,"text":"to go into houses where\nthey offered me things"},"414":{"dur":6,"text":"that, as an outsider,\nyou're told don't eat that."},"421":{"dur":1,"text":"Don't drink that."},"422":{"dur":4,"text":"But it feels really odd to not\nbecause they're being so kind."},"427":{"dur":5,"text":"I mean, like, we eat meat\nonce every two months."},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"So we slaughtered\nthe pig for you."},"435":{"dur":2,"text":"And we're serving\nit with lettuce."},"437":{"dur":1,"text":"You're not supposed\nto eat lettuce."},"439":{"dur":6,"text":"So obviously, you eat less\nand get full a little quicker."},"445":{"dur":2,"text":"But it's an\ninteresting perspective"},"448":{"dur":6,"text":"to have that, as a guest, I'm\ntrying to end up accommodating"},"454":{"dur":2,"text":"my host just as my host\nis probably even trying"},"457":{"dur":3,"text":"to accommodate me."},"460":{"dur":2,"text":"The more interesting\npoint of view"},"463":{"dur":5,"text":"was after I got\nback from Mexico,"},"468":{"dur":1,"text":"I ended up going\nthrough culinary school."},"469":{"dur":1,"text":"And I decided I\nloved hospitality."},"471":{"dur":1,"text":"I love serving people."},"473":{"dur":5,"text":"I loved experiencing\nthat moment of realizing"},"478":{"dur":2,"text":"that you're a part of someone's\nlife, whether they know it"},"481":{"dur":1,"text":"or not."},"482":{"dur":1,"text":"Like, they probably\ndon't know my name."},"484":{"dur":1,"text":"But I've met many people\nthat I've cooked for."},"486":{"dur":1,"text":"But they don't even know\nthat I cooked for them."},"487":{"dur":2,"text":"They just said, yeah, I went to\nLongman & Eagle and ate brunch,"},"490":{"dur":1,"text":"and it was great."},"492":{"dur":1,"text":"I was cooking that day."},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"I know I was because I was\nthere almost every day."},"498":{"dur":3,"text":"But their perspective in saying\nlike, oh, I had a great time"},"501":{"dur":1,"text":"kept me going."},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"So after I moved\nback from Japan,"},"505":{"dur":1,"text":"I went through culinary\nschool, and that"},"507":{"dur":1,"text":"was going to be my passion."},"508":{"dur":0,"text":"I was going to commit."},"509":{"dur":1,"text":"I was going to do it."},"510":{"dur":2,"text":"I was going to become a\nreally, really good cook."},"512":{"dur":5,"text":"And then, I was going to become\nthe best host I could be."},"518":{"dur":3,"text":"And I ended up, going\nthrough culinary school,"},"521":{"dur":1,"text":"I worked for Brian Poulsen."},"522":{"dur":2,"text":"Opened up Forest Grill, which\nis right around the corner"},"525":{"dur":1,"text":"from here."},"526":{"dur":4,"text":"I was the first AM\nsous chef there."},"531":{"dur":0,"text":"I worked a lot."},"532":{"dur":0,"text":"I loved it."},"533":{"dur":2,"text":"Every time I saw a\nchef jot down a note,"},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"I took notes on his notes."},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"And I went home and I\nresearched so I could figure out"},"540":{"dur":3,"text":"how to make polenta because I\nhad never made polenta before."},"543":{"dur":2,"text":"So I wanted to know everything."},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"And this was my way of trying\nto be the best host I can."},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"And I realized I started--"},"553":{"dur":3,"text":"in looking back on\nmy time and spending"},"556":{"dur":3,"text":"time with the culture of\nMexico and the people there--"},"560":{"dur":2,"text":"I realized I was starting to\nbecome part of the culture"},"562":{"dur":1,"text":"here."},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"But I was still more\ninterested in making sure"},"566":{"dur":4,"text":"that I could see not only the\nculture here but that culture"},"570":{"dur":3,"text":"elsewhere, and how to actually\npull that into our culture"},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"because, as\nAmericans, we've kind"},"575":{"dur":2,"text":"of adopted lots of cultures."},"577":{"dur":4,"text":"And those cultures have\nbecome intrinsically us."},"582":{"dur":1,"text":"People from all\nover the world, we"},"583":{"dur":1,"text":"come here and\nbring our cuisines,"},"585":{"dur":6,"text":"and we bring everything we are."},"592":{"dur":2,"text":"And then, we adapt it with\nall the people we're around."},"594":{"dur":1,"text":"Italian food, if\nyou go to Italy,"},"596":{"dur":2,"text":"isn't the same here\nas it is in Italy."},"598":{"dur":5,"text":"I think if anyone has been to\nItaly, you'll realize that."},"604":{"dur":3,"text":"So I decided I'd go as far\naway from French cuisine"},"607":{"dur":2,"text":"and American everything\nI possibly could."},"610":{"dur":4,"text":"So I thought about how\nisolated Japan was."},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"So I traveled to Japan."},"615":{"dur":1,"text":"And I went there."},"617":{"dur":7,"text":"I studied everyday, Japanese,\nfor six months before I left."},"625":{"dur":1,"text":"I did five days a week."},"626":{"dur":1,"text":"I did four hours a day."},"627":{"dur":0,"text":"I bought Rosetta Stone."},"628":{"dur":1,"text":"I bought Japanese for Dummies."},"630":{"dur":1,"text":"All those things\nbecause I didn't"},"631":{"dur":1,"text":"want to seem like I\nwas stupid the moment"},"632":{"dur":0,"text":"I walked in the door."},"636":{"dur":3,"text":"That being said, I walked\nup to this Michelin two"},"640":{"dur":0,"text":"starred restaurant."},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"It's currently\nMichelin three

men--"},"654":{"dur":2,"text":"well you can imagine Japan."},"656":{"dur":2,"text":"He came down wearing a\nmonochromatic yellow jumpsuit"},"658":{"dur":4,"text":"at 8 o'clock in the morning,\nhappy, and ready to go."},"663":{"dur":3,"text":"I think he was like\n56 or 57 at the time"},"666":{"dur":3,"text":"and had more energy than\nany person I can imagine"},"670":{"dur":1,"text":"at 8 o'clock in the\nmorning, especially"},"671":{"dur":2,"text":"after I realized the hours\nthat he was putting in."},"674":{"dur":1,"text":"And immediately-- I had\na translator there--"},"676":{"dur":1,"text":"he started talking\nto me because he"},"677":{"dur":1,"text":"knew I was studying Japanese."},"679":{"dur":1,"text":"And I could tell he was\ntalking a little slower"},"681":{"dur":3,"text":"and things like that."},"684":{"dur":4,"text":"I didn't understand a single\nword he said until he said,"},"688":{"dur":1,"text":"you understand that?"},"690":{"dur":2,"text":"I felt horrible."},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"I studied the wrong language."},"694":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't know what happened."},"695":{"dur":2,"text":"But my time with him was\nalso really interesting"},"697":{"dur":4,"text":"because it's completely devoid\nof a lot of the cultural norms"},"701":{"dur":2,"text":"that we have and the\ncultural norms that I"},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"had studied of Western culture."},"707":{"dur":3,"text":"He does a style\ncooking called keisuke,"},"710":{"dur":7,"text":"which is paired with\ntheir tea ceremony, which"},"717":{"dur":3,"text":"I got to study it with a\nbunch of 40-year-old women"},"720":{"dur":1,"text":"that giggled like\nmiddle school girls"},"722":{"dur":4,"text":"the entire time, every\nWednesday for three hours."},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"That being said, I got to\nsit on my knees for about two"},"729":{"dur":0,"text":"of those hours."},"730":{"dur":3,"text":"And then, they asked me to\ngracefully get up all the time."},"733":{"dur":6,"text":"That doesn't work, even\nin a 27-year-olds body."},"740":{"dur":2,"text":"But I spent some time with\nhim, and it was really"},"742":{"dur":5,"text":"amazing what he was as a host."},"747":{"dur":1,"text":"I kind of called myself\na guy [INAUDIBLE]"},"749":{"dur":3,"text":"because he would bring me\neverywhere he would go."},"753":{"dur":4,"text":"He loved having me there and\nwanted to show me everything."},"758":{"dur":0,"text":"I worked for free."},"759":{"dur":3,"text":"That being said, I\nlived in a dormitory"},"762":{"dur":3,"text":"with a few other\napprentices on a bunk bed."},"765":{"dur":2,"text":"My top bunk was the kitchen."},"768":{"dur":3,"text":"So it was like a rice cooker\nand an induction burner."},"771":{"dur":0,"text":"That was about it."},"774":{"dur":1,"text":"But he would bring me\neverywhere he'd go."},"776":{"dur":2,"text":"There's one of my\nfavorite times,"},"778":{"dur":2,"text":"which I didn't even\nunderstand what was happening,"},"780":{"dur":2,"text":"is he would tell me\nto go get dressed up."},"783":{"dur":2,"text":"He told me to put\non a tuxedo, which"},"785":{"dur":2,"text":"I took as I didn't\nbring a tuxedo,"},"787":{"dur":3,"text":"so I'm going to wear a button up\nshirt, and a belt, and slacks,"},"791":{"dur":3,"text":"and the nicest shoes I have."},"794":{"dur":1,"text":"And he did this every\ntime we went out."},"795":{"dur":4,"text":"And so he told me to go get\ndressed up in my tuxedo."},"799":{"dur":3,"text":"And I ran across to the\ndormitory, came
