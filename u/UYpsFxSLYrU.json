help."},"37":{"dur":1,"text":"I've chosen the A major,"},"38":{"dur":1,"text":"because I think the opening"},"40":{"dur":3,"text":"is a little more tricky\nthan the G and the D majors,"},"44":{"dur":2,"text":"which you almost\nlaunch straight into."},"47":{"dur":3,"text":"Um, the A is somewhat\nmore nerve-racking,"},"50":{"dur":1,"text":"and, yes,\nwe all get nervous,"},"52":{"dur":3,"text":"so there's nothing, you know,\nto be ashamed of there,"},"55":{"dur":2,"text":"but hopefully\nI can put you at your ease."},"58":{"dur":1,"text":"Now, the very opening,"},"60":{"dur":2,"text":"you'll have just had\nthe orchestra"},"63":{"dur":3,"text":"or the accompanist playing."},"66":{"dur":5,"text":"[Mozart's\nConcerto Number Five]"},"72":{"dur":2,"text":"And then on the solo part,"},"74":{"dur":4,"text":"you have to pick out\ntwo notes out of thin air"},"79":{"dur":2,"text":"with great beauty,"},"81":{"dur":3,"text":"and the sound has to be\nclear as a bell."},"85":{"dur":4,"text":"This is not easy in a stressful\nsituation like an audition,"},"90":{"dur":1,"text":"put the most important thing\nyou must remember"},"92":{"dur":1,"text":"is that on the third crotchet,"},"94":{"dur":2,"text":"the accompanist\nis gonna come in,"},"96":{"dur":3,"text":"and has to have\na clear idea of

wrote,"},"111":{"dur":3,"text":"so you need to actually\nkeep this adagio flowing."},"114":{"dur":2,"text":"It doesn't need\nto be so slow,"},"117":{"dur":1,"text":"and I think\nit's easier to play"},"119":{"dur":4,"text":"if you don't actually\nstick to being extremely slow."},"123":{"dur":3,"text":"So something like this,\nalthough stylistically"},"127":{"dur":3,"text":"you might want\nto

do too many rotations."},"209":{"dur":1,"text":"It just doesn't work,"},"210":{"dur":3,"text":"and you end up\nholding the tempo."},"213":{"dur":4,"text":"So hopefully\nI'll demonstrate that for you."},"218":{"dur":5,"text":"[Mozart's\nConcerto Number Five]"},"239":{"dur":1,"text":"Now I'd like to talk to you"},"241":{"dur":3,"text":"about the passage that comes\nlater on in the

music,"},"258":{"dur":1,"text":"um, within reason."},"260":{"dur":1,"text":"because, obviously,\nthis is still Mozart,"},"261":{"dur":3,"text":"but you can obviously\nplay much more espressivo,"},"265":{"dur":3,"text":"and have a lot of different\ncolors in the playing."},"310":{"dur":3,"text":"Now, depending which edition\nyou have of this music,"},"313":{"dur":3,"text":"most likely,\nyou will have had bar 135"},"317":{"dur":3,"text":"as forte, and then\nthe next passage as an echo."},"320":{"dur":2,"text":"I personally prefer\nto do that reversed,"},"323":{"dur":1,"text":"because I think it's stronger"},"325":{"dur":3,"text":"to go into the big\ntutti before the recap"},"328":{"dur":1,"text":"with a forte chord,"},"330":{"dur":1,"text":"because there's nothing worse"},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"than trying\nto tickle that in piano,"},"333":{"dur":1,"text":"so but obviously\nthat's up to you,"},"335":{"dur":3,"text":"and you make\nyour own decision."},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"The very opening\nof the symphony"},"341":{"dur":3,"text":"is a big forte pizzicato."},"344":{"dur":1,"text":"I think pizzicato\nis something"},"346":{"dur":2,"text":"that we're not often\ntaught properly,"},"348":{"dur":4,"text":"and often can sound\nreally quite nasty,"},"353":{"dur":2,"text":"if fingernails\nstart getting in the way."},"355":{"dur":3,"text":"The way I like to approach\nthe pizzicato in this"},"359":{"dur":3,"text":"is to go to the edge\nof the fingerboard"},"363":{"dur":4,"text":"and stroke down towards\nthe left hand."},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"If you go the other way,"},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"you end up usually catching\na nail or something."},"373":{"dur":3,"text":"This way you get a big,\nstrong sound, and it's round."},"376":{"dur":1,"text":"It doesn't have to be\na mega sound,"},"378":{"dur":1,"text":"because there's gonna be"},"379":{"dur":1,"text":"loads of people\nplaying it in the orchestra,"},"381":{"dur":3,"text":"so just be aware of that."},"385":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, the opening phrase,\nI think,"},"387":{"dur":4,"text":"really should travel\nto the ninth bar,"},"392":{"dur":3,"text":"rather than--\nI think it's quite easy"},"395":{"dur":2,"text":"to think of it as ending\nin the fourth bar,"},"397":{"dur":3,"text":"so I think it should sound\nsomething like this."},"400":{"dur":5,"text":"[Mendelssohn's\nSymphony Number Four]"},"419":{"dur":2,"text":"Now, this is a passage\nfor the first violins,"},"422":{"dur":2,"text":"which is absolutely beautiful,"},"424":{"dur":1,"text":"but it's actually quite tricky,"},"425":{"dur":2,"text":"because it's so finicky."},"427":{"dur":2,"text":"Bit like knitting a jumper\nor something."},"430":{"dur":3,"text":"The most important thing is\ntry and keep it really smooth,"},"433":{"dur":2,"text":"and also\nkeep it really simple."},"435":{"dur":3,"text":"First position works really well\nfor a lot of this,"},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"and second position,\nactually--"},"440":{"dur":1,"text":"I know we don't like playing\nthe second position,"},"442":{"dur":2,"text":"but it will really help\na lot of this."},"444":{"dur":3,"text":"And also keep your vibrato\nquite minimal."},"448":{"dur":3,"text":"Some conductors may ask you\nto play it non-vibrato,"},"451":{"dur":3,"text":"which is quite extreme,\nbut it does happen."},"455":{"dur":2,"text":"But I think it certainly helps"},"457":{"dur":4,"text":"to try not to be too romantic\nthrough this passage."},"462":{"dur":5,"text":"[Beethoven's\nSymphony Number Nine]"},"485":{"dur":2,"text":"Hopefully, you've found
