know\nShambhala Books?"},"107":{"dur":0,"text":"Yeah."},"108":{"dur":2,"text":"So Shambhala is\ninteresting, because they"},"110":{"dur":3,"text":"were one of the first\ncompanies way back in, I

you know of it."},"131":{"dur":3,"text":"The book was called \"The\nArt of War\" by Sun Tzu."},"135":{"dur":2,"text":"So that book was translated\nand published in English"},"137":{"dur":1,"text":"first by Shambhala."},"139":{"dur":3,"text":"And basically, as\nI understand it,"},"142":{"dur":2,"text":"was the financial success\npoint for that company."},"145":{"dur":2,"text":"So I was really privileged\nto be approached by Shambhala"},"148":{"dur":4,"text":"and asked as a meditation\nteacher, Zen practitioner,"},"152":{"dur":3,"text":"and also a mediator, whether\nI was interested in working"},"155":{"dur":2,"text":"with them to bring\nsomething into print."},"158":{"dur":4,"text":"So really, if you think\nabout the word \"meditation,\""},"162":{"dur":5,"text":"the word \"meditation\" has that\nroot, \"med-\" in it, I think,"},"167":{"dur":1,"text":"which is probably Latin."},"168":{"dur":3,"text":"Does anybody know

one"},"192":{"dur":2,"text":"with your life,\nwhereas mediation"},"195":{"dur":2,"text":"is about bringing two\ndiffering points of view"},"197":{"dur":3,"text":"or two different sets of\ninterests or a conflict"},"201":{"dur":3,"text":"in which there are many\nparties into one solution."},"204":{"dur":2,"text":"So the impulse of\nmeditation and of mediation"},"207":{"dur":1,"text":"are really the same impulse."},"208":{"dur":4,"text":"And so I gave a lot of thought\nto both internal conflict"},"213":{"dur":2,"text":"and also the conflict\nthat we experience,"},"215":{"dur":3,"text":"both in our personal\nlives and also culturally,"},"218":{"dur":3,"text":"and you might even\nsay on a global scale,"},"222":{"dur":2,"text":"and gave a lot of consideration\nto how we work with

is\nuncomfortable, is actually"},"235":{"dur":3,"text":"an incredible developmental\nopportunity, that there"},"238":{"dur":2,"text":"are things that can come\nfrom conflict when you work"},"241":{"dur":2,"text":"with it in an innovative way."},"243":{"dur":3,"text":"And because you are really\na culture of innovators,"},"246":{"dur":3,"text":"that working with conflict\nfrom a creative point of view"},"250":{"dur":2,"text":"is-- there's an incredible\namount of growth,"},"252":{"dur":1,"text":"possibility, and\nnew solutions that"},"254":{"dur":3,"text":"can come from it when we\ninclude it as potential."},"258":{"dur":1,"text":"The issue that we\nhave with conflict"},"260":{"dur":3,"text":"is that the old\nhardware, if you will--"},"263":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm going to try to use\nsome of your language"},"265":{"dur":3,"text":"and it's going to be kind of\npathetic, so just work with me."},"269":{"dur":3,"text":"So the old evolutionary\nhardware does not"},"272":{"dur":2,"text":"give you the\nsensation in your body"},"275":{"dur":2,"text":"that this is a creative\nopportunity, right?"},"277":{"dur":3,"text":"When the tri-brain-- we\nhave the reptilian brain,"},"281":{"dur":1,"text":"the mammalian brain,\nand the primate brain."},"282":{"dur":3,"text":"And when the reptilian brain\nsenses a threat-- which"},"285":{"dur":1,"text":"whenever there's a\nconflict, there's a threat."},"287":{"dur":2,"text":"There's a threat to our\nresources, our identity,"},"289":{"dur":4,"text":"our physical well-being,\nthe stability of our life."},"294":{"dur":4,"text":"Conflict is, by its nature,\nthreatening to the status quo."},"299":{"dur":2,"text":"So because it's\nthreatening, what happens"},"301":{"dur":2,"text":"is that these chemical--\nthat the reptilian brain"},"303":{"dur":1,"text":"stimulates the amygdala."},"305":{"dur":4,"text":"And the amygdala is\nthe signal function"},"309":{"dur":3,"text":"behind the eyes that\nstimulates the rest of the body"},"313":{"dur":1,"text":"to fight or flight or freeze."},"314":{"dur":4,"text":"So you get this chemical dump\nof cortisol, of adrenaline."},"319":{"dur":3,"text":"And so your later\nbrain can say, oh"},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"great-- creative opportunity."},"325":{"dur":3,"text":"But your body is saying, I'm\ngetting out of here, right?"},"328":{"dur":3,"text":"I'm going to fight, flight, or\ndisappear-- one or the other."},"331":{"dur":2,"text":"And so we have this problem."},"333":{"dur":4,"text":"We have this problem that\nthe sensation of conflict"},"338":{"dur":2,"text":"does not support this notion\nthat it's an opportunity,"},"340":{"dur":1,"text":"that it's a creative\npossibility."},"342":{"dur":3,"text":"Because everything in our body\nwants to get away from it."},"345":{"dur":3,"text":"The sensations of conflict,\nno matter what you do,"},"349":{"dur":1,"text":"do not feel good."},"350":{"dur":3,"text":"And so with enough practice,\nyou can override that sensation."},"354":{"dur":2,"text":"You can start to\nwire, if you will,"},"356":{"dur":3,"text":"the reptilian response to\nthese higher functions of mind."},"360":{"dur":3,"text":"And you can habituate\nyourself to reinterpreting it."},"363":{"dur":2,"text":"And you can do a\ncounter-intuitive"},"365":{"dur":1,"text":"starting to move towards it."},"367":{"dur":1,"text":"But there's so\nmuch that you have"},"369":{"dur":3,"text":"to kind of be able to\nmaster in your own body"},"372":{"dur":1,"text":"and also in your thoughts."},"373":{"dur":1,"text":"Because generally,\nas soon as you"},"375":{"dur":4,"text":"start to have the negative\nsensations of adrenaline"},"379":{"dur":2,"text":"and cortisol, usually\nthe cognitions follow."},"382":{"dur":1,"text":"In other words, your\nthoughts are, like,"},"383":{"dur":2,"text":"ooh, I don't want to be\nhere, why is this happening,"},"386":{"dur":2,"text":"that person is wrong,\nthis should stop."},"388":{"dur":2,"text":"So generally, your\nthoughts and your body"},"391":{"dur":2,"text":"both wire to get you\nout of the situation."},"393":{"dur":1,"text":"Does that make\nsense to everybody,"},"395":{"dur":1,"text":"what it is I'm saying?"},"396":{"dur":1,"text":"AUDIENCE: Does the\nreverse

working with,"},"403":{"dur":3,"text":"is that what happens is you\nenter into a feedback loop."},"406":{"dur":2,"text":"So when you work with\npeople with conflict,"},"408":{"dur":3,"text":"one of the things that you have\nto do is you have to-- well,"},"411":{"dur":1,"text":"I'll give you an\nexample that's more"},"413":{"dur":1,"text":"related to my own experience."},"414":{"dur":1,"text":"So there's a chapter in my book."},"416":{"dur":3,"text":"I was remarried, oh,\nit's been now 15 years."},"419":{"dur":3,"text":"And I remarried a man\nwho had three daughters,"},"423":{"dur":1,"text":"and their mother had died."},"424":{"dur":3,"text":"And I had one-- I have one son."},"427":{"dur":1,"text":"My son also has Down syndrome."},"429":{"dur":3,"text":"He's a genius."},"432":{"dur":4,"text":"And so we came together, and it\nwas incredibly intense for me,"},"436":{"dur":3,"text":"because they hadn't had a female\nin the household for five years"},"439":{"dur":1,"text":"since their mother died."},"441":{"dur":3,"text":"They were all at different\nages-- 16, 13, 9."},"444":{"dur":2,"text":"It was really challenging\nemotionally for me,"},"447":{"dur":3,"text":"both to merge into the culture\nbut also to kind of create"},"450":{"dur":2,"text":"certain kinds of\norganization and patterning"},"453":{"dur":2,"text":"that would work for\neveryone, including me."},"455":{"dur":1,"text":"Mostly, that wasn't happening."},"456":{"dur":3,"text":"So I would just feel\noverwhelmed, irritable."},"460":{"dur":1,"text":"I was losing my temper."},"461":{"dur":2,"text":"I just was starting,\nreally, to experience myself"},"464":{"dur":3,"text":"in a way that was just\nreally not acceptable."},"467":{"dur":1,"text":"So I developed a\npractice that when"},"469":{"dur":2,"text":"I started to feel really\ntense and really stressed,"},"472":{"dur":2,"text":"and that amygdala hijack\nstarted to happen,"},"474":{"dur":2,"text":"that I would immediately\ngo upstairs to my room,"},"476":{"dur":1,"text":"and I would sit down."},"478":{"dur":3,"text":"And the first thing I would\ndo is quiet my thinking mind"},"481":{"dur":2,"text":"and just sit with the\nintensity of the sensation."},"484":{"dur":1,"text":"Like where was I feeling this?"},"486":{"dur":2,"text":"I could feel the increase\nin my heart rate."},"488":{"dur":1,"text":"I would feel heat in my neck."},"489":{"dur":3,"text":"When we're in a conflict,\nour primate history,"},"493":{"dur":2,"text":"we tend to tighten the back\nof our neck and our jaw"},"495":{"dur":1,"text":"and hunch our shoulders."},"497":{"dur":2,"text":"And I could feel all\nof that in my body."},"499":{"dur":2,"text":"My solar plexus felt\nlike they were on fire."},"501":{"dur":2,"text":"There could be a\nsensation of nausea."},"503":{"dur":2,"text":"And the whole time, my thoughts\nare saying, this isn't OK."},"506":{"dur":1,"text":"Why are these people\nnot listening to me?"},"508":{"dur":1,"text":"What is the problem here?"},"509":{"dur":0,"text":"They're all insane."},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm living in a madhouse."},"511":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't like these people."},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"I don't want to be with them."},"513":{"dur":2,"text":"Now some tiny-- why\nare you laughing?"},"516":{"dur":1,"text":"[LAUGHTER]"},"517":{"dur":1,"text":"Because you've been there."},"518":{"dur":6,"text":"You know this demented voice\nthat just takes over, right?"},"524":{"dur":2,"text":"So my first thing\nwould be to just commit"},"526":{"dur":1,"text":"to experiencing the sensation."},"528":{"dur":1,"text":"Stop the thoughts."},"529":{"dur":1,"text":"Experience the sensation."},"531":{"dur":1,"text":"Literally receive them."},"532":{"dur":0,"text":"Get to know them."},"533":{"dur":3,"text":"This is what this really\nintelligent, evolutionary"},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"hardware is telling me."},"538":{"dur":1,"text":"Like, what does it feel like?"},"539":{"dur":3,"text":"It's really organizing\nme to get the hell out"},"543":{"dur":1,"text":"of here, basically."},"544":{"dur":4,"text":"So once I could pace that a\nlittle bit, and the sensations"},"548":{"dur":2,"text":"would start to calm down,\nthen I could pay attention"},"551":{"dur":1,"text":"to my thoughts."},"552":{"dur":6,"text":"But even with the slightest kind\nof attention-- it's amazing."},"559":{"dur":1,"text":"What I'm trying to\nsay is how quickly"},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"the thoughts\nreassert themselves."},"562":{"dur":1,"text":"So I would quiet my thoughts."},"563":{"dur":0,"text":"I'd be with the body."},"564":{"dur":2,"text":"And as soon as I'd turn my\nattention back to my thoughts,"},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"guess who was speaking again?"},"569":{"dur":2,"text":"Yeah, the demented, insane\nperson would start speaking."},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"And so then I would just\npay attention to that,"},"574":{"dur":4,"text":"and I would say, OK, what\nis the wisdom in this?"},"578":{"dur":2,"text":"What is actually right\nabout what I'm thinking?"},"581":{"dur":1,"text":"Because we have a\ntendency when we"},"583":{"dur":3,"text":"get hijacked like that\nto either be completely"},"586":{"dur":3,"text":"under the spell of the\ninsanity or completely,"},"590":{"dur":1,"text":"oh no, it's all fine."},"591":{"dur":0,"text":"That's not the case."},"592":{"dur":4,"text":"How do you find this middle way\nwhere you receive the wisdom?"},"597":{"dur":2,"text":"So I would say, we\nneed more structure."},"599":{"dur":1,"text":"We need to create\nsome patterns when"},"601":{"dur":1,"text":"we're having dinner together."},"602":{"dur":3,"text":"We need to actually listen\nto one another and exchange."},"606":{"dur":3,"text":"So I really could\nreceive the wisdom"},"609":{"dur":1,"text":"from what I was upset about."},"611":{"dur":3,"text":"And then when the thoughts are\nnow clarified, if you will,"},"614":{"dur":2,"text":"you receive and\nclarify the thoughts,"},"616":{"dur":2,"text":"those thoughts\nstart to discipline"},"618":{"dur":1,"text":"the physiological responses."},"620":{"dur":3,"text":"So then it's possible to go\nback into the conversation."},"623":{"dur":2,"text":"And even if you start\nto feel the contraction"},"625":{"dur":1,"text":"or whatever those\nare, you can sort of"},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"breathe that out\nand still assert"},"629":{"dur":3,"text":"what is it that's important\naround what I have to say"},"632":{"dur":4,"text":"and this whole body of\nconflict

body, consider"},"644":{"dur":3,"text":"how to work with the benefits\nof meditation practice."},"647":{"dur":1,"text":"And if you think\nabout meditation,"},"649":{"dur":2,"text":"really, as an
