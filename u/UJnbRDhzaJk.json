to\nsterilize the jars"},"508":{"dur":2,"text":"if you're canning something\nmore than 10 minutes."},"510":{"dur":1,"text":"But we went ahead\nand we got our jars,"},"512":{"dur":1,"text":"they've cooled off a little bit"},"514":{"dur":4,"text":"and we have our rings\nsimmering at 180 degrees."},"519":{"dur":1,"text":"- Wow."},"520":{"dur":2,"text":"- We've got our funnel\nready, jar

really, really\nsimple way to do this"},"532":{"dur":1,"text":"and we just finished."},"534":{"dur":2,"text":"We put the tomatoes\nin boiling water"},"536":{"dur":1,"text":"for about two minutes"},"538":{"dur":2,"text":"and then we put\nthem in ice-water"},"540":{"dur":2,"text":"and you can see how\neasily the peel comes off."},"543":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Chris] It comes right off."},"544":{"dur":1,"text":"- Yeah, it just\npeeled off so easily"},"546":{"dur":2,"text":"and after this\npoint we core them,"},"548":{"dur":1,"text":"chop them up really good"},"550":{"dur":2,"text":"and then we put\nthem in a big pot"},"553":{"dur":2,"text":"and as you can see I've\ngot my pot right here,"},"555":{"dur":1,"text":"but wasn't that easy?"},"556":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Chris] That was easy."},"558":{"dur":2,"text":"- Just went ahead and\ngot those taken care of."},"560":{"dur":1,"text":"So what we've done here,"},"562":{"dur":3,"text":"we've gone ahead and we\nhave simmered our tomatoes."},"565":{"dur":1,"text":"Now these are like we said,"},"567":{"dur":2,"text":"these are crushed tomatoes,"},"569":{"dur":3,"text":"and we're gonna have these\nin the pressure-canner"},"573":{"dur":1,"text":"for 15 minutes."},"574":{"dur":2,"text":"If you were gonna have\nthem in a water-bath canner"},"577":{"dur":1,"text":"it would take much, much longer,"},"578":{"dur":1,"text":"say 35 or 40 minutes."},"580":{"dur":1,"text":"So what we're gonna do here,"},"582":{"dur":2,"text":"we don't normally\npressure can tomatoes"},"584":{"dur":2,"text":"but this, by doing it this way"},"586":{"dur":1,"text":"we've saved up a\nlittle bit time."},"588":{"dur":3,"text":"Like I said, I'm\ngonna swap gears here."},"592":{"dur":1,"text":"If you'll hold this?"},"593":{"dur":1,"text":"- Do you need me to hold\nthat, I can do that."},"594":{"dur":0,"text":"- Thank you, I'm gonna\nmove this out of the way."},"595":{"dur":2,"text":"And what we will do, thank you,"},"598":{"dur":4,"text":"is go ahead and fill our\njars to within 1\/2 inch,"},"604":{"dur":2,"text":"we want about 1\/2\ninch head-space here."},"606":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Chris] Those tomatoes\nsmell good, by the way."},"608":{"dur":2,"text":"- Oh yes, this has been nice"},"610":{"dur":2,"text":"and you see, we\ndidn't add any water,"},"613":{"dur":1,"text":"they made their own juice."},"614":{"dur":1,"text":"- Ah, so this is\ntheir own juice."},"616":{"dur":0,"text":"That's a lot."},"617":{"dur":2,"text":"- Yeah, it made a lot of juice."},"619":{"dur":1,"text":"And we're gonna fill them"},"621":{"dur":3,"text":"to within 1\/2 inch of the top"},"624":{"dur":2,"text":"and people ask\nwhy do we do this?"},"626":{"dur":4,"text":"Well if you don't give\nthem enough head-space,"},"631":{"dur":2,"text":"let's say if we just filled it"},"633":{"dur":2,"text":"and it had an\ninch-and-a-half left,"},"636":{"dur":2,"text":"the top may become discolored"},"638":{"dur":2,"text":"and it might contract air"},"641":{"dur":2,"text":"and it would not seal properly."},"643":{"dur":2,"text":"And if we have too\nlittle head-space"},"646":{"dur":2,"text":"it might boil over\nduring the process."},"649":{"dur":1,"text":"So what we're gonna do,"},"650":{"dur":3,"text":"we're gonna go ahead an\nwipe the top of the jar"},"653":{"dur":2,"text":"and make sure that\nthere's no seeds"},"656":{"dur":1,"text":"or anything on here."},"657":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Chris] So good contact\nis most important?"},"659":{"dur":3,"text":"- Oh yeah, because these\nlids have to fit just right"},"662":{"dur":3,"text":"and we're gonna add 1\/4 teaspoon"},"665":{"dur":1,"text":"of citric acid."},"667":{"dur":1,"text":"This is to the pints"},"669":{"dur":3,"text":"and we're gonna add 1\/2 teaspoon"},"672":{"dur":1,"text":"of canning salt."},"675":{"dur":3,"text":"See 1\/2 teaspoon of\ncanning salt to the pints."},"680":{"dur":1,"text":"- So what was the acid for?"},"681":{"dur":1,"text":"Why do we need that?"},"682":{"dur":2,"text":"- Oh, it kinda\nhelps preserve it."},"685":{"dur":2,"text":"You can also use lemon juice,"},"687":{"dur":3,"text":"you could just about a\ntablespoon of lemon juice."},"690":{"dur":1,"text":"Now at this point\nI'm gonna go ahead,"},"692":{"dur":1,"text":"this is my bubbler,"},"693":{"dur":1,"text":"(Chris laughing)"},"694":{"dur":2,"text":"and I'm gonna stick this down,"},"697":{"dur":1,"text":"you might see a little bit"},"698":{"dur":2,"text":"of air bubbles coming out."},"701":{"dur":1,"text":"- [Chris] Just a few."},"703":{"dur":3,"text":"- Not as many as if you\nwere doing green beans."},"706":{"dur":1,"text":"So what we're gonna do,"},"708":{"dur":1,"text":"we've got our air bubbles out"},"709":{"dur":2,"text":"and this is a handy\nlittle measurement tool,"},"711":{"dur":3,"text":"we're gonna measure\n1\/2 inch head-space,"},"715":{"dur":1,"text":"see all the way around,"},"717":{"dur":1,"text":"that's about 1\/2 inch."},"719":{"dur":3,"text":"And then we just add\nthat lid right on top"},"723":{"dur":1,"text":"and we wipe that"},"726":{"dur":2,"text":"and then we get our bands"},"728":{"dur":1,"text":"and we put these bands on"},"730":{"dur":2,"text":"just fingertip tight."},"732":{"dur":2,"text":"I've watched a lot of videos"},"734":{"dur":1,"text":"and sometimes they\njust put them on"},"736":{"dur":1,"text":"way, way too tight."},"738":{"dur":1,"text":"And at this point we're gonna"},"739":{"dur":1,"text":"go ahead and put them"},"741":{"dur":1,"text":"in the pressure canner."},"743":{"dur":2,"text":"I'm gonna put this in\nthe pressure canner"},"745":{"dur":1,"text":"and then I want to talk to you"},"747":{"dur":1,"text":"a little bit about safety\nof pressure canning."},"748":{"dur":1,"text":"It's just right over here"},"750":{"dur":1,"text":"and in our pressure canner"},"751":{"dur":2,"text":"we've got about two\ninches of water."},"754":{"dur":1,"text":"Now people call me all the time,"},"756":{"dur":1,"text":"they've never used\na pressure canner"},"758":{"dur":1,"text":"and they're afraid of it"},"759":{"dur":1,"text":"and they ask me,"},"760":{"dur":1,"text":"what am I gonna do?"},"761":{"dur":1,"text":"I might have one\nwith a dial gauge"},"763":{"dur":1,"text":"or a weighted gauge."},"765":{"dur":1,"text":"- I can understand people\nbeing afraid of that though."},"766":{"dur":2,"text":"- Oh, I've heard horror\nstories about these things."},"769":{"dur":2,"text":"You see this has a\nlittle dial on it"},"771":{"dur":1,"text":"and you can come to our office"},"773":{"dur":2,"text":"and have this tested\nfree of charge."},"775":{"dur":2,"text":"We test it at five pounds,"},"778":{"dur":2,"text":"10 pounds and 15\npounds of pressure."},"780":{"dur":3,"text":"But for our tomatoes we're\ngonna use 11 pounds of pressure."},"784":{"dur":2,"text":"If we were going to\nuse a weighted gauge"},"786":{"dur":2,"text":"we would use 10\npounds of pressure."},"788":{"dur":2,"text":"Now you notice I've got a little\npiece of paper towel here,"},"791":{"dur":1,"text":"one thing you want to do,"},"793":{"dur":1,"text":"if you'll hold this\nfor me, please?"},"794":{"dur":0,"text":"- Okay."},"795":{"dur":1,"text":"- You want to oil the gasket"},"797":{"dur":2,"text":"and we learned through\ntrial and error,"},"799":{"dur":1,"text":"I think you were here that day,"},"801":{"dur":1,"text":"we couldn't get the lid off."},"802":{"dur":0,"text":"- I remember."},"803":{"dur":1,"text":"- And we had to get Jim in here"},"805":{"dur":1,"text":"to get the lid off for us."},"806":{"dur":1,"text":"But you want to go ahead"},"808":{"dur":1,"text":"and just rub this oil"},"812":{"dur":1,"text":"around the gasket."},"814":{"dur":3,"text":"Also when you have\nyour gasket tested,"},"818":{"dur":2,"text":"you want to make sure\nthat it's not dry-rotted,"},"821":{"dur":2,"text":"you can see this one's\nin pretty good shape."},"823":{"dur":2,"text":"You also may want\nto run a string"},"826":{"dur":2,"text":"through this little vent."},"828":{"dur":1,"text":"This is very important"},"830":{"dur":1,"text":"because what we're gonna do"},"832":{"dur":3,"text":"is we're gonna\nset the lid on top"},"835":{"dur":1,"text":"and once we secure it"},"836":{"dur":2,"text":"we're gonna let it\nvent for 10 minutes"},"839":{"dur":3,"text":"and you will see steam\ncoming out of this vent."},"843":{"dur":3,"text":"After the steam has\nescaped for 10 minutes,"},"849":{"dur":1,"text":"and that's very important,"},"851":{"dur":2,"text":"we're gonna put\nthe petcock on top"},"853":{"dur":3,"text":"and then we'll start\nbuilding our pressure up."},"856":{"dur":3,"text":"Usually on an electric\nrange it's at number seven"},"859":{"dur":2,"text":"to maintain it at 11\npounds of pressure."},"862":{"dur":2,"text":"And we'll start\ntiming it at 11 pounds"},"865":{"dur":2,"text":"and we'll give it 15 minutes"},"867":{"dur":2,"text":"at 11 pounds of pressure."},"872":{"dur":2,"text":"- All right, Miss Cathy, special\ndelivery, how 'bout that?"},"875":{"dur":1,"text":"- Thank you, Chris."},"876":{"dur":2,"text":"One of the important\nfactors of pressure canning"},"879":{"dur":2,"text":"is you have to

good to have\na strong man around,"},"888":{"dur":1,"text":"to lift it off,"},"890":{"dur":1,"text":"I'm sure this weighed\nat least 25 pounds"},"891":{"dur":2,"text":"with all of the tomatoes in it."},"893":{"dur":1,"text":"We appreciate you doing this."},"895":{"dur":3,"text":"At this point, we are going\nto have to let it cool down."},"899":{"dur":2,"text":"It will probably\ntake about 40 minutes"},"901":{"dur":1,"text":"for it to cool down."},"903":{"dur":3,"text":"- All right, Miss Cathy,\nnow it's been 40 minutes,"},"906":{"dur":1,"text":"so let's see the
