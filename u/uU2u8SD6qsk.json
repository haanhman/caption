I thought the same"},"152":{"dur":4,"text":"thing that every ten year old thinks - what if I used my right hand? (Graeme) Yeah. (Rob) No ten year old thinks that."},"156":{"dur":4,"text":"And so I switched, I switched my left hand"},"160":{"dur":4,"text":"to be my dominate hand and I retaught myself how to write. I refused"},"164":{"dur":4,"text":"for the next two years refused to make my right hand my dominate hand. (Graeme) Aha. (Rob) I learned to catch,"},"168":{"dur":4,"text":"I play guitar, so I play guitar with both hands. (Graeme) Wow. (Rob) And"},"172":{"dur":4,"text":"then one day, I was published pretty young, so I had"},"176":{"dur":4,"text":"an international cover due, and math homework due"},"180":{"dur":4,"text":"(Graeme) Yeah. (Rob) and I was like - I've got to go faster, so I picked up two brushes"},"184":{"dur":4,"text":"and I was like oh I can do this. And then I realised that I could actually do my math homework and paint"},"188":{"dur":4,"text":"(Graeme) Same time - I think the painting won out in the end didn't it? (Rob) You know at that"},"192":{"dur":4,"text":"point, yeah. But yeah, so"},"196":{"dur":4,"text":"that was it. I often paint two paintings or three paintings, or"},"200":{"dur":4,"text":"four paintings at one time. (Graeme) And we've actually got some footage of Rob working on"},"204":{"dur":4,"text":"stage with Tech N9ne, and some of the other guys in the Hip Hop bands as well"},"208":{"dur":4,"text":"which is really quite amazing. I mean what he does on the stage is really quite dynamic,"},"212":{"dur":4,"text":"and he moves around all over the place - paints backwards, paints upside"},"216":{"dur":4,"text":"down I think sometimes as well. But today, we're very privileged to"},"220":{"dur":4,"text":"actually have two fantastic companies that are sponsoring the show."},"224":{"dur":4,"text":"Princeton Art Brushes, which is the largest manufacturer of art brushes in the United"},"228":{"dur":4,"text":"States, I mean potentially the world. And also Royal Talens from"},"232":{"dur":4,"text":"from the Netherlands, who makes a huge amount of products as well. I mean tell us something just"},"236":{"dur":4,"text":"their products? (Rob) The thing about Princeton, is I use"},"240":{"dur":4,"text":"I use a brush called Umbria, Umbria Catalyst. (Graeme) Yeah. (Rob) but the Umbria's my"},"244":{"dur":4,"text":"my favourite because it just holds its"},"248":{"dur":4,"text":"shape so well and I abuse the hell out of my brushes."},"252":{"dur":4,"text":"If you watch any clips or even see me today I'm just like -  beat the hell out of them."},"256":{"dur":4,"text":"And no other brush honestly, no"},"260":{"dur":4,"text":"other brush can put up with that. I've never had a brush like,"},"264":{"dur":4,"text":"then go back to form, you know, and not fall apart."},"268":{"dur":4,"text":"And with you know, Royal Talens, the colors are amazing. The"},"272":{"dur":4,"text":"consistency of it is just perfect (Graeme) Yeah. (Rob) and they have different things like"},"276":{"dur":4,"text":"inks. So I can't say good enough things about them, it's you know. (Graeme) It's amazing, a"},"280":{"dur":4,"text":"huge amount of ranges as far as the products concerned: (Rob) Oh, absolutely. (Graeme) inks,"},"284":{"dur":4,"text":"watercolors, acylics, oils - it's fantastic. But you're going to be using the"},"288":{"dur":4,"text":"watercolor pencils today. (Rob) I'm using watercolor pencils and gouache. (Graeme) Okay. (Rob) I"},"292":{"dur":4,"text":"might be using some ink. Half the time I don't know"},"296":{"dur":4,"text":"what I'm gonna do. I mean if it's around me when I'm painting, I'll pick it up."},"300":{"dur":4,"text":"(Graeme) Yeah. (Rob) You know, if there's dirt there I'll probably use that, you know. (Graeme) Yeah, when you see"},"304":{"dur":4,"text":"Rob work you'll understand what I'm talking about. He listens to music"},"308":{"dur":4,"text":"continually, consistently. (Rob) I cannot paint without it. (Graeme)  Literally, if he's not listening to"},"312":{"dur":4,"text":"music of some sort he actually stops like a robot. But he's gonna have"},"316":{"dur":4,"text":"ear phones in, he's going to be listening to music and he's still gonna be able hear me talk"},"320":{"dur":4,"text":"while he's doing what he's doing, but it's an essential part of your creativity. (Rob) Yes,"},"324":{"dur":4,"text":"I know, and you guys come in and go: do you have to have music?"},"328":{"dur":3,"text":"Ahh, well either that I could just stand there the whole time"},"331":{"dur":4,"text":"(Graeme) Yeah. (Rob) so. (Graeme) Yeah, well when you see"},"336":{"dur":4,"text":"you'll understand cause it's really quite amazing. But what I'm going to do is, I'm going to get out of here. I'm still going to ask you some questions"},"340":{"dur":4,"text":"as we go along. (Rob) Sure. (Graeme) You're going to show us how you create these amazing pieces and"},"344":{"dur":4,"text":"how you use these fantastic products at the same time. (Rob) Ah, yes. (Graeme) I'm looking forward top it."},"348":{"dur":4,"text":"(Rob) Fantastic, brother."},"360":{"dur":4,"text":"(Graeme) Okay,"},"364":{"dur":4,"text":"Rob. Well you've got a pretty iconic gentleman up there. (Rob) Yes. (Graeme) One of the twenty"},"368":{"dur":4,"text":"seven club. (Rob) Yes. (Graeme) You wouldn't have to guess I think, that's Jimmy Hendrix,"},"372":{"dur":4,"text":"and you're very famous for painting very famous people."},"376":{"dur":4,"text":"And you've got some watercolor paper there, and you've got some"},"380":{"dur":4,"text":"watercolor, Talen watercolor pencils. (Rob) Yep. (Graeme) And you're doing"},"384":{"dur":4,"text":"doing what you do which is work in two hands. Tell me, tell me the process? (Rob) You know,"},"388":{"dur":4,"text":"when I work in two hands, a lot of times I'll"},"392":{"dur":4,"text":"what I'll do is one will hit a higher part,"},"396":{"dur":4,"text":"or just a different color. (Graeme) Yeah. (Rob) I can figure out where I'm going to blend ahead"},"400":{"dur":4,"text":"of time, so when I'm doing it that way I know"},"404":{"dur":4,"text":"what one hand is doing one thing and blending it in, and the other is just"},"408":{"dur":4,"text":"laying a base. (Graeme) But you also use, you use"},"412":{"dur":4,"text":"Windex. (Rob) I do, Windex tends to chew"},"416":{"dur":4,"text":"paint. It tends to, instead of water - water will move"},"420":{"dur":4,"text":"a paint around, were Windex will eat the paint and make it drip."},"424":{"dur":4,"text":"Gravity then works with it better. So I make a line"},"428":{"dur":4,"text":"like that, and I spray it with Windex"},"432":{"dur":4,"text":"and you can watch it just eat the paint."},"436":{"dur":4,"text":"But if I take water, say if I go over here"},"440":{"dur":4,"text":"it doesn't do anything. So the difference is"},"444":{"dur":4,"text":"one will chew the paint through and the other will move the paint"},"448":{"dur":4,"text":"around. So the other thing I'm doing is"},"452":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm actually going to paint this with gouache, but I'm laying down"},"456":{"dur":4,"text":"a little bit of a color base"},"460":{"dur":4,"text":"with watercolor pencil, so I know that I can go in"},"464":{"dur":4,"text":"and have a base laid down where my colors are actually"},"468":{"dur":4,"text":"going to be. So I'm"},"472":{"dur":4,"text":"creating a map for myself. I use to be purely a"},"476":{"dur":4,"text":"photo realist and then I, with the onset of Photoshop"},"480":{"dur":4,"text":"up and all of that is like why, why would you do that? So"},"484":{"dur":4,"text":"I also got to a point were I like mistakes;"},"488":{"dur":4,"text":"I love mistakes, because mistakes are what brings life to a painting to"},"492":{"dur":4,"text":"me. If I feel it's getting too perfect I'll do something really crazy and I'll"},"496":{"dur":4,"text":"throw paint at it, or if anybody watches videos of me I'll spit paint,"},"500":{"dur":4,"text":"or spit water - not paint."},"504":{"dur":4,"text":"Talens is a fantastic paint, but you're not suppose to eat it."},"508":{"dur":4,"text":"(Graeme) Yeah. Rob's actually listening to his music now so,"},"512":{"dur":4,"text":"so he's actually listening to me and listening to the music. He actually responds"},"516":{"dur":4,"text":"very dramatically to what the music doing, and he sort of gets into these zones"},"520":{"dur":4,"text":"occasionally. He calls it blacking out, and he just starts to work"},"524":{"dur":4,"text":"and music kicks in and away he goes. But one of my"},"528":{"dur":4,"text":"heroes is a friend of yours, Neal deGrasse Tyson, and he"},"532":{"dur":4,"text":"said: I'd like to get into your brain. (Rob) Yeah, he is a"},"536":{"dur":4,"text":"god, he's a trip. I was at San Diego"},"540":{"dur":4,"text":"Comic-Con, and I was on stage with him and listening"},"544":{"dur":4,"text":"to his theories on Star Wars, and Lightsabers and"},"548":{"dur":4,"text":"stuff is hilarious. (Graeme) Yeah. (Rob) It's hilarious. (Graeme) You do like"},"552":{"dur":4,"text":"about sixteen comic conventions a year. (Rob) I can't make it to all of them, but"},"556":{"dur":4,"text":"I try and hit a lot of main ones. (Graeme) I can see what you mean about getting"},"560":{"dur":4,"text":"those Princeton brushes a workout. (Rob) Oh, that is an"},"564":{"dur":4,"text":"understatement. I do things"},"568":{"dur":4,"text":"while that next comment was really going to be: I do things with these brushes nobody should"},"572":{"dur":4,"text":"do. (Graeme) I can just see now this Rock n Roll"},"576":{"dur":4,"text":"kicking into that earpiece - it"},"580":{"dur":4,"text":"has to be. (Rob) It's true. (Graeme) That's great but."},"584":{"dur":4,"text":"(Graeme) The spontaneity"},"588":{"dur":4,"text":"is quite extraordinary, what Rob achieves with"},"592":{"dur":4,"text":"two hands and two brushes is just quite amazing, it really is."},"596":{"dur":4,"text":"We're very privileged to be here."},"600":{"dur":4,"text":"Looking at your earlier work, you were really"},"604":{"dur":4,"text":"disciplined as far as the reality of the technique (Rob) Yes. (Graeme) is concerned."},"608":{"dur":4,"text":"And then it was your wife, Bev (Rob) It was. (Graeme) who basically"},"612":{"dur":4,"text":"said let your hair down, so to speak. (Rob) Yeah, this is how I've painted pretty much"},"616":{"dur":4,"text":"my whole life in my studio, and I was getting"},"620":{"dur":4,"text":"burnout doing photorealism. I personally"},"624":{"dur":4,"text":"needed to have something that was gonna challenge me a"},"628":{"dur":4,"text":"bit more. And my wife came to me and she said why don't you paint for"},"632":{"dur":4,"text":"everybody like you paint in your studio. And I was like, nobody wants"},"636":{"dur":4,"text":"to see that. And that's kinda how it started, I mean this is"},"640":{"dur":4,"text":"how I've personally always painted for myself. (Graeme) Yeah."},"644":{"dur":4,"text":"(Rob) And my wife, who"},"648":{"dur":4,"text":"is much smarter than I am,"},"652":{"dur":4,"text":"knew enough to say, you know what,"},"656":{"dur":4,"text":"don't, don't  quite art because if you quite art its like"},"660":{"dur":4,"text":"quitting breathing, you know after you've done it for so"},"664":{"dur":4,"text":"long it's just ingrained in you - it's what you know."},"668":{"dur":4,"text":"So I did that and"},"672":{"dur":4,"text":"I switched over to this crazy whacked out style that I"},"676":{"dur":4,"text":"have. (Graeme) You've actually done a few album covers for Tech"},"680":{"dur":4,"text":"N9ne. (Rob) Tech N9ne, I've done album covers for Blue Oyster"},"684":{"dur":4,"text":"Cult, wow, a tonne of people. (Graeme) Those Tech N9ne images but"},"688":{"dur":4,"text":"are just fantastic, (Rob) Oh, thank you so much. (Graeme) like another"},"692":{"dur":4,"text":"world. (Rob) Thank you so much. Yeah, well you know, it's funny cause"},"696":{"dur":4,"text":"in meeting Tech, I had talked to a Producer who said"},"700":{"dur":4,"text":"you really need to meet Tech. It would be great if you guys worked"},"704":{"dur":4,"text":"together. You know, me being me, I was like I don't know, maybe."},"708":{"dur":4,"text":"Let me meet him, let me see if it's even gonna work. (Graeme) Yeah."},"712":{"dur":4,"text":"And we met at"},"716":{"dur":4,"text":"Bob's Big Boy in Toluca Lake, (Graeme) Okay. (Rob) and ah,"},"720":{"dur":4,"text":"he came in and he just started talking about his ideas"},"724":{"dur":4,"text":"and we just hit it off. (Graeme) Amazing, and you've become good friends since."},"728":{"dur":4,"text":"(Rob) Oh yeah, yeah,Tech is - he's great. But he probably fills"},"732":{"dur":4,"text":"four or five shows a year with him now. He's really the person that"},"736":{"dur":4,"text":"kinda got me to go on stage. I'd been talking about it"},"740":{"dur":4,"text":"with one of the other owners of Strange Music, Travis O'Guin, and"},"744":{"dur":4,"text":"I was like - no, I don't know, maybe, maybe not."},"748":{"dur":4,"text":"No. And then Tech came to me he's like well don't worry about it cause"},"752":{"dur":4,"text":"I have terrible stage fright and"},"756":{"dur":4,"text":"(Graeme) Yes, so he lied. (Rob) Yeah,"},"760":{"dur":4,"text":"and you know, he goes don't worry the lights will be in your eyes. And I was like, oh, okay,"},"764":{"dur":4,"text":"so I walk out on stage and - he"},"768":{"dur":4,"text":"lied. (Graeme) I can see everybody. (Rob) You know, it's like"},"772":{"dur":4,"text":"wait a minute. And so I'm on stage"},"776":{"dur":4,"text":"and I'm thinking to myself I can't - I can't do this. He's"},"780":{"dur":4,"text":"my friend, I can apologise to him. I can't"},"784":{"dur":4,"text":"do this after all. And I turned around - and my wife will disagree with me,"},"788":{"dur":4,"text":"she will say she was just standing there. Cause when I tell this story"},"792":{"dur":4,"text":"you know, she's like - I didn't really do that. She did. (Graeme) Yeah."},"796":{"dur":4,"text":"(Rob) She was standing there with arms crossed,"},"800":{"dur":4,"text":"so I was like, face my wife or face the crowd. Take the crowd."},"804":{"dur":4,"text":"(Graeme)  And actually we've got a picture of Bev, that you've painted as well"},"808":{"dur":4,"text":"that we're just (Rob) Yes. (Graeme) screening up too. She's a beautiful woman. (Rob) Ah, thank"},"812":{"dur":4,"text":"you, thank you very much. My wife's cool. (Graeme) So you were telling the"},"816":{"dur":4,"text":"viewers a funny story about a mate of yours, and he said something about"},"820":{"dur":4,"text":"a chicken head? What's the story with that? (Rob) So there"},"824":{"dur":4,"text":"was a publisher, (Graeme) Yeah. (Rob) he's actually a friend, and he"},"828":{"dur":4,"text":"called me up. He didn't know me at the time and he said Prior,"},"832":{"dur":4,"text":"you know, I want to hire you to do my three book series but I"},"836":{"dur":4,"text":"know you hide things in your paintings. So if you hide anything"},"840":{"dur":4,"text":"I'm going to fire you. And I was like dude, what would I do"},"844":{"dur":4,"text":"hide a chicken head in every page? So I did."},"848":{"dur":4,"text":"In fact when I,"},"852":{"dur":4,"text":"when I got to the second issue, I did a double splat"},"856":{"dur":4,"text":"page, which is two pages that open up into a long"},"860":{"dur":4,"text":"painting. And if you turn the entire book sideways,"},"864":{"dur":4,"text":"its a giant chicken head and"},"868":{"dur":4,"text":"so, on the third issue he calls me up and he goes, you know I'd fire you right now"},"872":{"dur":4,"text":"but I'm too busy looking for your chicken heads. And there"},"876":{"dur":4,"text":"for it stuck. And had I known that a chicken head"},"880":{"dur":4,"text":"would be what stuck with my fan base, I'd have picked something way cooler"},"884":{"dur":4,"text":"than a chicken head. (Graeme) You've also done some amazing pieces"},"888":{"dur":4,"text":"of the series Game of Thrones, There's some very spectacular series out there"},"892":{"dur":4,"text":"these days, and we are in the centre of Hollywood. One of a gentleman"},"896":{"dur":4,"text":"called John Snow, well he's one of the characters in"},"900":{"dur":4,"text":"the actual (Rob) Yeah, it's one of my favourite shows"},"904":{"dur":4,"text":"on the air as well. So you know,"},"908":{"dur":4,"text":"painting, painting it and getting to put a little bit of"},"912":{"dur":4,"text":"of my spin on them: I love it. (Graeme) And even"},"916":{"dur":4,"text":"a lot of the Star Wars characters that you've done, I mean I can"},"920":{"dur":4,"text":"almost guarantee that somebody's watching this show has actually seen your work somewhere,"},"924":{"dur":4,"text":"somehow, either on a book, or an album cover, or somewhere"},"928":{"dur":4,"text":"cause I know I'd seen it many years ago myself. Star Wars, with - you did one of all the"},"932":{"dur":4,"text":"villains. The Sith Lords. (Rob) Oh yeah. (Graeme)  that's pretty cool. I have come here today"},"936":{"dur":4,"text":"Rob, to tell you I'm your father. (Rob) Wow."},"940":{"dur":4,"text":"That's not weird. (Graeme) So you were"},"944":{"dur":4,"text":"six. Yes, we start young."},"948":{"dur":4,"text":"So not only are you a famous artist yourself, but you"},"952":{"dur":4,"text":"actually know some other very, very famous artists (Rob) Oh, (Graeme) as well."},"956":{"dur":4,"text":"(Rob) Yeah, I know a lot of artists that are"},"960":{"dur":4,"text":"just amazing and Dorian Vallejo, is just"},"964":{"dur":4,"text":"he's just an amazing artist. You know, to me it's a very"},"968":{"dur":4,"text":"cool little tight community once you"},"972":{"dur":4,"text":"get in there. Art as with any arts at all,"},"976":{"dur":4,"text":"music, acting, whatever it is, can sometimes get"},"980":{"dur":4,"text":"petty and that's a shame because I think every, I think art"},"984":{"dur":4,"text":"should all just stick together and you know, should all"},"988":{"dur":4,"text":"be - I'm not saying one giant happy family cause that's never gonna happen,"},"992":{"dur":4,"text":"but I do think that there needs to be more"},"996":{"dur":4,"text":"trading secrets and more talking and all of that. There's so much"},"1000":{"dur":4,"text":"to learn from so many people there's just not enough time in the"},"1004":{"dur":4,"text":"world for it. (Graeme) Who would you say influenced"},"1008":{"dur":4,"text":"you in your career? (Rob) Well, my Dad,"},"1012":{"dur":4,"text":"who is an amazing artist, really"},"1016":{"dur":4,"text":"influenced me. There's an artist named Bob Heindel, who is"},"1020":{"dur":4,"text":"who when he was with us"},"1024":{"dur":4,"text":"was known as the modern day Gar. And Drew Struzan,"},"1028":{"dur":4,"text":"another, another big influence you know,"},"1032":{"dur":4,"text":"growing up, cause he did so many of the iconic movie"},"1036":{"dur":4,"text":"posters. (Graeme) Yeah, and even some of the work you've done yourself"},"1040":{"dur":4,"text":"sort of harks back to the bygone era of movies with"},"1044":{"dur":4,"text":"Boris Karloff, (Rob) Oh. (Graeme) and you know, Nosferatu the"},"1048":{"dur":4,"text":"original vampire movie. I love old, old monster movies."},"1052":{"dur":4,"text":"And by the way, Graeme I have to say"},"1056":{"dur":4,"text":"after seeing your amazing art,"},"1060":{"dur":4,"text":"I'll fire it right back at you: when did you start?"},"1064":{"dur":4,"text":"(Graeme) A long time ago - five years of age."},"1068":{"dur":4,"text":"But you must have started about the same age yourself didn't you? (Rob) Yeah, I was"},"1072":{"dur":4,"text":"like basically out f the womb hen my parents were having me"},"1076":{"dur":4,"text":"do art. But you know just because you or I"},"1080":{"dur":4,"text":"started so young, doesn't mean that you have to be young"},"1084":{"dur":4,"text":"to start, cause you don't. You can start at any age"},"1088":{"dur":4,"text":"and accomplish whatever you want to accomplish. (Graeme) So in"},"1092":{"dur":4,"text":"comparison with the gouache, obviously the inks give you"},"1096":{"dur":4,"text":"a lot more flow with your color. (Rob) The one thing I"},"1100":{"dur":4,"text":"really like about the Ecoline Inks,"},"1104":{"dur":4,"text":"is the fact that they're so bright"},"1108":{"dur":4,"text":"and they really just pop. (Graeme) You were saying before"},"1112":{"dur":4,"text":"one of the concerts you did with Tech N9ne, that you"},"1116":{"dur":4,"text":"had a business man from Saudi Arabia walk up to you"},"1120":{"dur":4,"text":"at the end of one of the shows. (Rob) Yeah, and he brought,"},"1124":{"dur":4,"text":"he bought a painting from me which I won't say the price, but I will say"},"1128":{"dur":4,"text":"it set, it set the standard for my pricing today."},"1132":{"dur":4,"text":"And if he watches"},"1136":{"dur":4,"text":"this: thank you!
