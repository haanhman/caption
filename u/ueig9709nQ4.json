day-to-day operation of some of our\nnation's biggest antipoverty programs."},"30":{"dur":5,"text":"At the New York City Human Resources Administration,\nwe administered everything from cash,

learned and what I saw was that\ngovernment can create an environment whereby"},"61":{"dur":5,"text":"people in poverty can move into work and raise\ntheir incomes."},"67":{"dur":4,"text":"But it takes adherence to certain core principles."},"71":{"dur":8,"text":"And those principles are: we must require\nwork in return for assistance."},"80":{"dur":6,"text":"We must also reward work by making low wages\ngo farther."},"87":{"dur":8,"text":"We must always talk about two-parent families\nand the importance of mothers and fathers"},"95":{"dur":3,"text":"in the appropriate raising of

occurred during that time."},"171":{"dur":6,"text":"And it was positive and forward looking and\nit made our country better."},"178":{"dur":7,"text":"And ultimately, it was inspiring because it\nshowed that government and us, Americans,"},"185":{"dur":2,"text":"could improve our country."},"187":{"dur":5,"text":"And then, at the request of his friend, Robert\nKennedy, we moved to New York City, where"},"193":{"dur":5,"text":"Robert Kennedy had started a small antipoverty\nprogram in Bedford-Stuyvesant, one of the"},"198":{"dur":8,"text":"largest slums in America at the time, a neighborhood\nof 500,000 New Yorkers in central Brooklyn."},"207":{"dur":5,"text":"And my father was involved in a small program\nbringing economic development and

Corporation,"},"257":{"dur":6,"text":"hundreds of thousands were sucked into a life\nof dependency and no work."},"263":{"dur":3,"text":"And our city was almost brought to its

worked there for Governor Pataki and\nthen for Mayor Giuliani for that entire period."},"303":{"dur":3,"text":"And what did we do?"},"307":{"dur":3,"text":"We required work in return for public assistance."},"310":{"dur":5,"text":"We made it a clear expectation that it was\na reciprocal relationship between the receiver"},"316":{"dur":5,"text":"of assistance and the provider of aid."},"322":{"dur":2,"text":"In that regard, we changed the names of our\noffices."},"325":{"dur":3,"text":"They used to be called -- think of this, the\nwelfare offices in New York City used to be"},"328":{"dur":2,"text":"called Income Maintenance Centers."},"331":{"dur":1,"text":"Income Maintenance Centers."},"333":{"dur":3,"text":"We changed them to be Job Centers."},"336":{"dur":5,"text":"We paid people that tried to help people get\njobs only if they got jobs."},"341":{"dur":2,"text":"We paid for performance."},"343":{"dur":1,"text":"We talked about child support enforcement."},"345":{"dur":5,"text":"We said children need two parents contributing."},"350":{"dur":6,"text":"There's a responsibility for both parents\nto care for their children."},"357":{"dur":5,"text":"And we created an environment where if there\nwasn't a job or someone couldn't work, we"},"362":{"dur":5,"text":"said to them, well, we need you to be involved\nin

work."},"388":{"dur":6,"text":"So public health insurance for low wage workers,\nwe were generous with it."},"394":{"dur":4,"text":"Food Stamp benefits for working people, we\nprovided it."},"399":{"dur":5,"text":"Childcare assistance, the Earned Income Tax\nCredit -- we promoted these supports for low"},"404":{"dur":3,"text":"wage workers, so wages could go further."},"408":{"dur":1,"text":"We talked about family."},"410":{"dur":1,"text":"We promoted two-parent families."},"412":{"dur":9,"text":"And always, always we understood that in order\nto succeed

jobs."},"430":{"dur":2,"text":"We said we need jobs."},"432":{"dur":1,"text":"Any job is a step up."},"434":{"dur":4,"text":"So we promoted hospitality and restaurants\nand health

jobs."},"449":{"dur":6,"text":"Require work, reward work, talk about family,\npromote a strong economy."},"456":{"dur":3,"text":"Those are the four principles of success in\nthis

help."},"506":{"dur":7,"text":"It went from 43 percent to 63 percent -- a\n20 percent point increase, unprecedented and"},"514":{"dur":6,"text":"remarkable and it happened all across the\ncountry, not only in New York City."},"520":{"dur":9,"text":"Child poverty in New York City declined dramatically\nin the late '90s up into the 2000s, from 43"},"529":{"dur":5,"text":"percent to 28 percent --

welfare reform."},"563":{"dur":9,"text":"Now, since the early 2000s, I have to say,\nI'm not sure we've kept focused on those core"},"572":{"dur":1,"text":"principles."},"573":{"dur":3,"text":"We've gotten away from the required work requirements."},"577":{"dur":6,"text":"We've made rewarding work sometimes replace\nwork, so that some of the benefits we provide"},"583":{"dur":2,"text":"provide disincentives to people being in work."},"586":{"dur":5,"text":"We haven't talked about the importance of\ntwo-parent families enough."},"591":{"dur":6,"text":"And most egregiously, we've allowed our economy\nto not grow."},"598":{"dur":7,"text":"The greatest tragedy of the anemic recovery\nwe have been through these last five years"},"605":{"dur":4,"text":"is the damage it's done to poor Americans."},"610":{"dur":6,"text":"So from someone who's been in the business,\nwho's seen it work successfully and seen it"},"617":{"dur":9,"text":"maybe not work so successfully, require work,\nreward work, talk about family, promote a"},"627":{"dur":1,"text":"strong economy."},"629":{"dur":1,"text":"Those are the keys."},"630":{"dur":5,"text":"Now, I have one last point I want to make\nand this is an important one."},"635":{"dur":11,"text":"It is a common desire to promise an outcome,\nto guarantee that we will -- if we do this,"},"646":{"dur":8,"text":"we will guarantee people's rising safely into\nthe middle class."},"655":{"dur":2,"text":"Governments can't promise that."},"657":{"dur":2,"text":"They can't guarantee that."},"660":{"dur":2,"text":"People make that happen."},"663":{"dur":7,"text":"People make that happen if the environment\nis created for that to happen."},"670":{"dur":5,"text":"So to promise an outcome of that kind, to\nguarantee it as if it would -- as if government"},"675":{"dur":5,"text":"could provide it, it's a false promise and\nit's a harmful promise."},"680":{"dur":7,"text":"But if we create an environment whereby people\nin
